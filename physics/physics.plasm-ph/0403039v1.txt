Numerical evidence of non-diﬀusive transport in three-dimensional, resistive pressure-gradient-
driven plasma turbulence is presented. It is shown that the probability density function (pdf) of
test particles’ radial displacements is strongly non-Gaussian and exhibits algebraic decaying tails.
To model these results we propose a macroscopic transport model for the pdf based on the use of
fractional derivatives in space and time, that incorporate in a uniﬁed way space-time non-locality
(non-Fickian transport), non-Gaussianity, and non-diﬀusive scaling. The fractional diﬀusion model
reproduces the shape, and space-time scaling of the non-Gaussian pdf of turbulent transport calcu-
lations. The model also reproduces the observed super-diﬀusive scaling.

Recent experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that transport in magnetically conﬁned fusion plasmas devi-
ates from the standard diﬀusion paradigm. Typical examples include the conﬁnement time scaling in low conﬁnement
mode plasmas [1,2], perturbative experiments [3–5], and the non-Gaussianity and long-range correlations of ﬂuctu-
ations [6]. The standard diﬀusion paradigm breaks down in these cases because it rests on restrictive assumptions
including locality, Gaussianity, lack of long-range correlations, and linearity. In particular, according to Fick’s law,
the ﬂuxes, which contain the dynamical information of the transport process, are assumed to depend only on local
quantities, i.e. the gradients of the ﬁelds. Also, at a microscopic level, the diﬀusion paradigm assumes the existence
of an underlying un-correlated, Gaussian stochastic process, .i.e. a Brownian random walk.

The need to develop models that go beyond these restrictive assumptions, is the main motivation of this letter that
has two connected goals. The ﬁrst goal is to show numerical evidence of non-diﬀusive transport in pressure-gradient-
driven plasma turbulence. We do this by integrating test particles in the E × B ﬁeld obtained from a nonlinear,
three-dimensional turbulence model. Test particle studies of this type have the advantage that incorporate in the
particle trajectories all the physics of the turbulence model. However, this “microscopic” approach has the limitation
of being time consuming, and potentially redundant in the sense that it tracks individual, particle orbit information
that from a statistical point view might be irrelevant. This issue takes us to the second goal of this letter which is
to propose and test a macroscopic model describing the statistical properties of transport in pressure-gradient-driven
plasma turbulence. The proposed model is based on the use of fractional derivative operators which, as it will be
explained below, incorporate in a natural, uniﬁed way, non-locality in space and time, non-Gaussianity, and anomalous
diﬀusion scaling.

The underlying instability in pressure-gradient-driven plasma turbulence is the resistive interchange mode, driven
by the pressure gradient in regions where the magnetic ﬁeld line curvature is negative. In this system, changes in
the pressure gradient trigger instabilities at rational surfaces that locally ﬂatten the pressure proﬁle and increase the
gradient in nearby surfaces. This in turn leads to successive instabilities and intermittent, avalanche-like transport
[7], which has been observed to cause anomalous diﬀusion [8]. This instability is the analog of the Raleigh-Taylor
instability, extensively studied in ﬂuids, responsible for the gravity driven overturning of a low density ﬂuid laying
below a high density ﬂuid. In magnetically conﬁned plasmas the role of gravity is played by the curvature of the
magnetic ﬁeld lines which in a cylindrical geometry is always negative and depends only on the radius.

The turbulence model that we use, describes the coupled evolution of the electrostatic potential Φ and pressure p

in a cylindrical geometry [7]

also included in the pressure equation. This term can be interpreted as a parallel thermal diﬀusivity. The evolution

It contains a source term, S0, which is only a function of r. This source of particles and heat is due, for instance,
to neutral beam heating and fueling. In this case, S0 is essentially determined by the beam deposition proﬁle. In
the present calculations, we assume a parabolic proﬁle, S0 = ¯S0
. The model parameters used here are
µ = 0.2 a2/τR and χ⊥ = 0.025 a2/τR, where τR ≡ a2µ0/η is the resistive time and a the minor radius. The rest of
(cid:3)
the parameters in the model can be reduced to two dimensionless quantities the Lundquist number, which is taken
to be S = 105, and β0/2ε2 = 0.018, where β0 is the value of β at the magnetic axis, and ε = a/R0. The numerical
calculations were carried out using the KITE code [9] with 363 Fourier components to represent the poloidal and
toroidal angle dependence for each ﬂuctuating component, and a radial grid resolution of ∆r = 7.50 × 10−4a.

Since the magnetic ﬁeld is ﬁxed, the turbulence-induce transport is only due to the ﬂuctuating electrostatic potential.
This electrostatic approximation, which is quite reasonable for low β values, is needed in order to carry out the
numerical calculations in the time range required for reliable transport studies. As an initial condition we used 25, 000
tracer particles with random initial positions in θ and z, and radial position r = 0.5 a. Finite size eﬀects did not seem
to be relevant because during the evolution there were very few particles moving out of the system. In the numerical
integration of Eq. (4), it is observed that tracer particles either get trapped in eddies for long times, or jump over
several sets of eddies in a single ﬂight, giving rise to anomalous diﬀusion [8].

Due to the intrinsic stochasticity of test particle orbits, one has to resort to a statistical approach to study transport
in this system. Our main object of study here is the probability density function (pdf) of radial displacements of the
particles, P (x, t), where x = (r − a/2)/a and t = τ /τR. By deﬁnition, at t = 0, P (x, t) = δx. As t evolves, the pdf
broadens and develop tails. The triangles in Figure 1 show P (x, t) at t = 0.64 obtained from the histogram of particle
displacements. The log-normal scale of the plot makes clear the strong non-Gaussianity of the density function (in
this scale a Gaussian is a parabola). The insert in Fig. 1 shows that the tails exhibit algebraic decay with exponent
equal to 1.75 ± 0.03. The numerical results show that for times above t = 0.1, the moments of the test particles
displacements exhibits super-diﬀusive scaling, hxni ∼ tnν , with ν = 0.66 ± 0.02.

In what follows we show that these numerical results can be quantitatively described with a transport model using

fractional derivative operators in space and time. The generic form of the proposed model is

Despite the apparent complexity of their deﬁnition, fractional derivatives are natural generalizations of regular deriva-
tives. In particular, as expected, for α and β integers, these operators reduce to regular derivatives, and results of
regular calculus extend directly to the fractional domain making the analytical study of fractional equations a tractable
problem. Further information about the deﬁnition and basic mathematical properties of these operators can be found
in Ref. [10].

Fractional derivatives are integro-diﬀerential operators that incorporate non-locality in space and time in a natural
way. In particular, the right hand side of Eq. (5) evaluated at a ﬁxed position x takes into account non-local, spatial
contributions to the ﬂux from all points located to the left (through aDα
x ), and all points located to the right (through
b ) of x [11]. The constants w± control the degree of left-right asymmetry in the transport processes. This is
xDα
relevant to fusion plasmas where asymmetric ﬂuxes are usually observed. The non-locality in time is incorporated in
the fractional derivative operator on the left hand side of Eq. (5). Here, only the left derivative is used because, by
causality, transport can only depend on the past history of the system. In addition to the space-time non-locality,
the fractional diﬀusion model exhibits non-diﬀusive scaling of moments. In an inﬁnite domain, the algebraic decaying
tails of non-Gaussian distributions lead to divergent moments. However, in physical applications (e.g. Ref. [12]) a
ﬁnite-x cutoﬀ leads to the ﬁnite size scaling hxni ∼ tnν, where ν = β/α. Depending on the value of α and β, transport
can be super-diﬀusive (2ν > 1), sub-diﬀusive (2ν < 1), or diﬀusive (2ν = 1).

The physics behind the model in Eq. (5) can be further understood from the close connection between transport
models and the theory of random walks. The standard diﬀusion model is a macroscopic description of the Brownian
random walk which assumes that at ﬁxed time intervals t = T, 2T, . . . nT . . . particles at a microscopic level experience
an un-correlated random displacement, or jump, ℓn, with probability Px, where Px is assumed to have a ﬁnite second
moment.
In a similar way, fractional diﬀusion models can be viewed as macroscopic descriptions of generalized
Brownian random walk models known as the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) models [12]. In addition to
the jump probability density Px, the CTRW model introduces a waiting time probability function Pt. That is, the time
between jumps, rather than being ﬁxed as in a Brownian walk, it is drawn from a probability function Pt. The diﬀerent
types of CTRW processes, and the resulting macroscopic transport models, can be classiﬁed based on the characteristic
waiting time, T , and the characteristic mean-square jump, σ2, being ﬁnite or divergent [12]. Based on this, the model
(5) involving fractional derivatives in space and time can be understood as a general macroscopic description of an
underlying microscopic stochastic process in which particles exhibit both, jumps without a characteristic spatial scale,
and waiting times without a characteristic time scale. The space non-locality is a direct consequence of the existence of
anomalously large jumps (known also as Levy ﬂights) that connect distant regions in space, and the time non-locality
is due to the history-dependence introduced in the dynamics by the presence of anomalously large waiting times.

The fractional diﬀusion model in Eq. (5) is fairly general, and depending on the values of α, β, and w±, diﬀerent
transport processes can be modeled, including sub-diﬀusive transport, super-diﬀusive transport, and asymmetric
transport. In what follows we show that for the symmetric, super-diﬀusive transport observed in pressure-gradient-
driven turbulence: w+ = w− = −0.5/ cos(πα/2), α = 3/4, β = 1/2, and Λ = 0. To understand this, consider the
initial value problem of Eq. (5) in an inﬁnite domain, x ∈ (−∞, ∞). Setting a = −∞ and b = ∞ in the left and right
fractional derivative operators, and introducing the Fourier and Laplace transforms

is the Mittag-Leﬂer function [13,10]. As expected, for α = 2 and β = 1, P reduces to a Gaussian. For β = 1 ,
1 < α ≤ 2, P becomes a symmetric Levy stable distribution [14], and for 0 < β < 1 , α = 2 it reduces to the solution
of the sub-diﬀusion fractional equation [12]. Introducing the space-similarity variable, η = t−β/αx, the solution can
be written as

The solid line in Fig. 1 shows a plot of this solution with β = 1/2, α = 3/4, and χ = 0.09. The agreement with the
test particles turbulence simulations (triangles) is good. More precisely, using the asymptotic result K(η) ∼ η−(1+α)
for large η [13], it follows that P (x, t0) ∼ x−(1+α), for x ≫ tβ/α
, which for α = 3/4 gives a decay exponent equal to
1.75, a value in very good agreement with the numerical result, 1.75 ± 0.03, shown in the insert in Fig. 1.

The index β determines the time-asymptotic scaling properties of P . To show this, we introduce the time-scaling

variable ζ = t |x|−α/β, and write the solution as

P = |x|−1 ζ−β/α K

.

Using again the large η, and also the small η asymptotic behavior of the function K(η) it follows that P (x0, t) ∼ tβ,
for t ≪ |x0|α/β, and P (x0, t) ∼ t−β, for t ≫ |x0|α/β. This scaling is veriﬁed in Fig. 2 that shows the evolution in time
of P at a ﬁxed position x0. The analytical solution according to Eq. (11), shown with a solid line, exhibits algebraic
tails in the small t and large t limits, and the expected peak at intermediate times. The circles and the triangles in
the ﬁgure denote the results obtained from the test particles turbulence simulations. The agreement is good, but not
as sharp as the one in Fig. 2 due to the numerical limitations in the integration of the turbulence model for large
times.

As mentioned before, α and β determine the scaling properties of the moments of the test particles displacements.
In particular, hxni ∼ tnν , with ν = β/α.
In the present case, α = 3/4 and β = 1/2, implies ν = 2/3, a value
in very good agreement with the one obtained from the test particles turbulence simulation, ν = 0.66 ± 0.02. The
super-diﬀusive scaling implies an anomalous conﬁnement time scaling, tc ∼ aα/β. For the case studied here, tc ∼ a3/2,
a reasonable value in the range of the experimentally determined values which typically deviate from the standard-
diﬀusion prediction t ∼ a2 [2].

Summarizing, in this letter we have presented numerical evidence that test particle transport in three-dimensional,
resistive, pressure-gradient-driven plasma turbulence exhibits non-diﬀusive transport. In particular, we have shown
that the pdf of particles is strongly non-Gaussian and exhibits algebraic tails with a decay exponent 1.75 ± 0.03. Also,
the moments of the test particles displacements exhibits supper-diﬀusive scaling with ν = 0.66 ± 0.02. We proposed
a macroscopic transport model for the pdf based on the use of fractional derivative operators or order α = 3/4 in
space, and order β = 1/2 in time. The model incorporates in a natural, uniﬁed way, space-time nonlocality (non-
Fickian transport), non-Gaussianity, and anomalous diﬀusion scaling. In good agreement with the turbulent transport
calculations, the pdf in the fractional model decay with exponent 1 + α = 1.75, the pfd scale in time with exponent
β = 1/2, and the moments scale with exponent ν = β/α = 2/3 which implies a conﬁnement time scaling tc ∼ a3/2.
We have focused on symmetric fractional derivatives (i.e. w+ = w−). However, the phenomenology of asymmetric
operators is quite interesting, and important in fusion plasmas. For example, we have observed that asymmetric
fractional derivative operators give rise to ballistic-like propagation of pulses. These results indicate that fractional
diﬀusion models might be a useful tool to model rapid propagation phenomena in fusion devices. Another area where
fractional operators looks promising is in the study of the role of non-diﬀusive transport in the L-H transition. One
way to approach this problem is to incorporate fractional diﬀusion operators into reaction-diﬀusion systems of the

4

type used in L-H transition studies (e.g. Ref. [15]). A ﬁrst step in this direction was presented in Ref. [16] where it
was shown that fractional diﬀusion gives rise to asymmetric, exponential acceleration of fronts.

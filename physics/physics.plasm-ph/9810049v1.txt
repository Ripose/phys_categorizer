Abstract. A non-relativistic Fokker-Planck equation for the electron distribution

function is formulated incorporating the eﬀects of stochastic acceleration by whistler-

mode waves and Coulomb collisions. The stationary solution f to the equation, subject

to a zero-ﬂux boundary condition, is found to be a generalized Lorentzian (or kappa)

distribution, which satisﬁes f ∝ v−2(κ+1) for large velocity v, where κ is the spectral

index. The parameter κ depends strongly on the relative wave intensity R. Taking

into account the critical energy required for resonance of electrons with whistlers, we

calculate a range of values of R for each of a number of diﬀerent space plasmas for

which kappa distributions can be expected to be formed. This study is one of the ﬁrst

in the literature to provide a theoretical justiﬁcation for the formation of generalized

Lorentzian (or kappa) particle distribution functions in space plasmas.

1. Introduction

In the natural space environment, e.g., planetary magnetospheres, and the solar

wind (and actually many other kinds of astrophysical objects), plasmas are generally

observed to possess a particle distribution function with a non-Maxwellian high-energy

tail. The distribution function typically has a power-law tail in energy [distribution

∝ (particle energy)−(κ+1)], and frequently can be modeled by a generalized Lorentzian

(kappa) distribution. For a variety of observational data, see Vasyliunas [1968], Gosling

et al.

[1981], Armstrong et al.

[1983], Christon et al.

[1988], Divine and Garrett

[1983] and references contained in Summers and Thorne [1991], Collier [1993], and

Mace and Hellberg [1995]. Associated with the generalized Lorentzian distribution has

been developed the modiﬁed plasma dispersion function which is an eﬀective tool for

investigating waves and microinstabilities in space plasmas

[Summers and Thorne,

1991; Mace and Hellberg, 1995; Summers et al., 1994; 1996]. Physical mechanisms that

can produce power-law particle distributions include stochastic acceleration by plasma

wave turbulence, and collisionless shocks. Kappa-like distribution functions which are

Maxwellian at low energies and power law at high energies can also be produced by

velocity-space L´evy ﬂight probability distributions [e.g., Collier, 1993]. It is the process

of stochastic acceleration by plasma wave turbulence with which we shall be concerned

in this paper. Many researchers have studied stochastic acceleration of charged particles

by various modes of plasma wave, e.g., Gurevich [1960], Kennel and Engelmann [1966],

Melrose [1980, 1986], Steinacker and Miller [1992], and Schlickeiser [1997]. Hasegawa

et al. [1985] showed that superthermal radiation can enhance velocity-space diﬀusion

so as to produce a power-law distribution. However, these authors did not estimate

values of the intensity of the radiation ﬁeld and other plasma parameters necessary to

obtain a reasonable value for the power law. The source of the free energy to excite

such intense radiation was another question left unaddressed. Melrose [1980] pointed

out that the equilibrium distribution is a power law only if the momentum diﬀusion

4

coeﬃcient D(v) is proportional to v−1, where v is the particle velocity. For example,

for Langmuir waves, D(v) ∝ v−1; but this requires the turbulent spectrum I(k) to be

independent of the wave number k, which is an unlikely possibility [Melrose, 1980].

Stochastic acceleration by plasma waves is characteristically slow due to the diﬀusive

nature of the scattering process. Nevertheless, the process may be applicable, for

instance, in planetary magnetospheres in cases when typical electron acceleration times

are of the order of tens of hours. We note that Schlickeiser [1997] has recently obtained

a diﬀusion coeﬃcient varying as D(v) ∝ v−1 when the charged particles are accelerated

by whistler-mode waves. The momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient results from the resonant

interaction between particles and whistler-electron cyclotron plasma waves. Similar

formulae have also been obtained by Dermer et al.

[1996]. Numerical calculations

of the momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcients for particle-whistler interaction were given by

Steinacker and Miller [1992] and Pryadka and Petrosian [1997], but no analytical

formulae were obtained for medium energetic electrons (10 keV to a few hundreds

of keV), which limits their application by other authors. There are several physical

processes that can drive the whistler instability. For example, anisotropies in the plasma

velocity distribution can make whistlers unstable. Moreover, a kappa distribution

can itself enhance the whistler-mode instability, as compared with the Maxwellian

distribution [e.g., see Summers and Thorne, 1992; Xue et al., 1993; Mace, 1998].

In the following section, we shall develop a non-relativistic theory for the formation

of kappa distributions by means of whistler-mode wave stochastic acceleration.

2. Theory

We assume a Kolmogorov-type magnetic turbulence power spectrum in the wave

number for the whistler-mode waves, namely,

I = I0k−q
k ,

(1)

5

with q > 1, where kk ≥ kmin, kk is the parallel wave number, and I0 = (q − 1)(δB)2kq−1

min is

the energy density of the whistler turbulence. It is natural to assume that kminVA = Ωi

for whistler waves, where VA and Ωi are respectively the Alfv´en speed and the

non-relativistic ion gyrofrequency. In this paper we are concerned with the situation

in which pitch-angle anisotropy is small and the particle distribution is isotropic. For

higher energy electrons, it is generally the case that the time-scale for pitch angle

diﬀusion is much less than that for momentum diﬀusion, and so the assumption of

isotropy is justiﬁed. For lower energy electrons, where the pitch angle and momentum

diﬀusion rates are comparable, we assume that isotropization by Coulomb collisions

occurs. The momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient can then be averaged over the pitch angle.

Herein, we employ the diﬀusion coeﬃcient given by Schlickeiser [1997], namely,

D = c2Ωe

(cid:18)

JW β−1,

(2)

where Ωe is the non-relativistic electron gyrofrequency, βA = VA/c, β = v/c, c is the

speed of light, and JW is a weakly varying function of v. Henceforth in this paper, the

Kolmogorov turbulent spectrum (q = 5/3) is adopted. It then follows that JW is of

order unity. In accordance with the whistler wave dispersion relation and the resonance

condition [Melrose, 1986], we ﬁnd that electrons can resonate with whistlers provided

that β ≥ (mp/me)1/2βA. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient (2) is valid in the region where

(mp/me)1/2βA ≤ β ≤ (mp/me)βA. However, lower-energy electrons can be accelerated

by high wave-number whistlers as the electron cyclotron branches of the dispersion

relation are approached [Petrosian, 1994].

Coulomb interactions result in both momentum diﬀusion and friction in the kinetic

equation for the particle distribution function. As we are assuming the distribution to

be isotropic, we can ignore the angular contribution to Coulomb collisions [Hinton,

1983], giving the equation,

νs is the slowing-down rate, and D⊥c and Dkc are the respective perpendicular and

the thermal velocities of the electrons and ions [ve ≪ v, vi ≪ v, ve,i = (2Te,i/me,i)1/2], we

3. Discussion

In the foregoing, we have determined that stochastic acceleration by whistler-mode

turbulence can produce a particle distribution with a power-law tail, i.e., f ∝ v−2(κ+1).

By Equation (12), we note that the value of the spectral index κ depends strongly on

the relative wave intensity R. In Table 1, for various space plasmas, we have listed

Table 1

typical values of the parameters ne, B0, βA and the thermal energy(temperature). The

basic plasma parameters in this table for the solar wind were taken from Kivelson

and Russell [1995], for the Earth’s plasma sheet from Christon et al. [1988], for the

Jovian magnetosphere from Dessler [1983] and Divine and Garrett [1983], and for

the Saturnian magnetosphere from Sittler et al.

[1983]. Because only the energetic

electrons with velocities satisfying β ≥ (mp/me)1/2βA can resonate with ﬁrst-harmonic

shown in Figure 1. For a speciﬁc plasma characterized by its electron number density

Figure 1

whistlers, we list in Table 1 the critical energy Ec corresponding to the critical velocity

βc = (mp/me)1/2βA. If the critical energy Ec is much larger than the electron thermal

energy, then the whistlers can only accelerate non-thermal high energy particles,

for which the Coulomb momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dkc is much less than the

acceleration diﬀusion coeﬃcient. In this case, an injection mechanism is required to

pre-accelerate the particle to the required critical energy Ec. It is straightforward

to show that this situation applies, for instance, to solar ﬂares. In fact, there is no

observational evidence that electrons have a kappa distribution in solar ﬂares. If

the critical energy Ec is of the same order as the thermal energy, then whistlers can

accelerate the thermal particles into the high-energy tail of the distribution, and so a

kappa distribution can be produced. This is essentially the case for all the space plasmas

ne and background magnetic ﬁeld B0, formula (12) gives the spectral index κ produced

by whistler turbulence of power R. In Figure 1, for each of the given space plasmas, we

show the range of R-values associated with the range of κ-values that might be typically

observed, namely 2 ≤ κ ≤ 8. In addition, we also show the value of the critical energy

Ec for each plasma. The results imply that relatively weak whistler-mode turbulence

could produce power-law spectra in the Earth’s plasma sheet and in the Jovian and

Saturnian magnetospheres, whereas stronger turbulence is required in the solar wind.

In conclusion, we should point out both the merits and the limitations of this

study. Of course, it is not the case that all electron power-law spectra are produced

by whistler-mode turbulence, or that whistler-mode turbulence will always give rise to

electron power-law spectra. Nevertheless, under certain restrictions, we have shown that

the production of electron power-law energy spectra by stochastic acceleration due to

whistlers is a viable possibility. Apart from the non-relativistic fromework, limitations

of the study include the assumptions of isotropy, a zero-ﬂux boundary condition, and

a momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient based on wave propagation strictly parallel to the

9

background magnetic ﬁeld. The intrinsic value of the study is that it is one of the ﬁrst

in the literature to present a ﬁrm theoretical basis for the formation of generalized

Lorentzian (or kappa) particle distribution functions in space plasmas.

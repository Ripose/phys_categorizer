Abstract. Doppler reﬂectometry spatial and wavenumber resolution is analyzed
within the framework of the linear Born approximation in slab plasma model. Explicit
expression for its signal backscattering spectrum is obtained in terms of wavenumber
and frequency spectra of turbulence which is assumed to be radially statistically
inhomogeneous. Scattering eﬃciency for both back and forward scattering (in radial
direction) is introduced and shown to be inverse proportional to the square of radial
wavenumber of the probing wave at the ﬂuctuation location thus making the spatial
resolution of diagnostics sensitive to density proﬁle. It is shown that in case of forward
It is
scattering additional localization can be provided by the antenna diagram.
demonstrated that in case of backscattering the spatial resolution can be better if
the turbulence spectrum at high radial wavenumbers is suppressed. The improvement
of Doppler reﬂectometry data localization by probing beam focusing onto the cut-oﬀ is
proposed and described. The possibility of Doppler reﬂectometry data interpretation
based on the obtained expressions is shown.

Spatial and Wavenumber Resolution of Doppler Reﬂectometry

1. Introduction

Plasma rotation velocity measurements are of great importance for understanding
transition to improved conﬁnement in tokamaks and physics of transport barriers.
Extensively used nowadays for such investigations is Doppler reﬂectometry [1, 2, 3].
This technique provides measuring ﬂuctuations propagation poloidal velocity which is
often shown to be dominated by ~E
~B velocity of plasma [3]. In using this method a
probing microwave beam is launched into the plasma with ﬁnite tilt angle with respect
to density gradient. A back-scattered signal with frequency diﬀering from the probing
one is registered by a nearby standing or the same antenna. The information on
plasma poloidal rotation is obtained in this technique from the frequency shift of the
backscattering spectrum which is supposed to originate from the Doppler eﬀect due
to the ﬂuctuation rotation. Spatial distribution of the scattering phenomena, which
is usually assumed to occur in the cut-oﬀ vicinity, is the key issue for the diagnostic
applications.

×

Some numerical simulations undertaken (see [3] and references there,

[4]) and
analytical results [5] demonstrate the possibility of the measurements localization by
the cut-oﬀ but the problem of Doppler reﬂectometry locality remains still open and
lacks comprehensive analytical treatment. This stems from the fact that to be sure that
main contribution to the registered signal is made by the cut-oﬀ vicinity one should
compare it with integral contributions of distant from the cut-oﬀ regions which can be
substantial depending on density proﬁle.

This paper attempts to clarify this problem. Here we present a theoretical
investigation of the Doppler reﬂectometry signal dependence on the turbulence
distribution with respect to the cut-oﬀ. We consider slab two-dimensional model
(see ﬁgure 1). This simpliﬁcation allows us to perform straightforward analytical
treatment and obtain explicit reliable expressions for the scattered signal which can be
easily used for estimation of diagnostics locality and experimental data interpretation
without complicated and time consuming numerical calculation using full-wave codes,
etc. The model considered can be readily applied to large in comparison with
probing beam width, vertically elongated (ITER-like) plasma. The limitations of this
approximation are discussed below.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 the consideration is carried on
in the geometrical optics approximation for arbitrary plasma density proﬁle. This
approximation fails to hold in the cut-oﬀ region. So in this region the analysis is made
assuming the density proﬁle to be linear and using exact expressions for the probing
and scattered wave electric ﬁeld given by Airy functions (section 3). Some numerical
examples are given in section 4. Brief discussion of the model considered and results
obtained is provided in section 5. Finally, a conclusion follows in section 6.

2. Reﬂectometry signal in WKB–approximation

In this section the reﬂectometry signal is obtained in geometrical optics (or WKB)
approximation. The plasma is assumed to be nonuniform in x (radial) direction and
uniform in y (poloidal) direction. External magnetic ﬁeld is supposed to be along z axis.
O-mode Doppler reﬂectometry is considered but the ﬁnal results can be easily adapted
to X-mode reﬂectometry applying corresponding expression for wave radial wavenumber
dependence on the radial coordinate.

A received signal is obtained using reciprocity theorem [6] and is assumed to be
created by single scattering (linear) mechanism. The frameworks of this approximation
and experimental means to check its applicability are discussed in section 5. The
scattering signal averaging is made taking into account radial statistical inhomogeneity
of the turbulence. Then a scattering eﬃciency is introduced and analyzed.

2.1. Scattering signal

We consider normalized antenna electric ﬁeld in the following form

~Ea(~r) = ~ez

W (x, ky)f (ky)eikyy

where factor f (ky) takes into account the antenna pattern describing antenna radiation
in vacuum

f (ky) =

dyE0(x = 0, y)e−ikyy

The vacuum antenna ﬁeld E0 diﬀers from Ea by the absence of the reﬂected wave
contribution.

Here and further we suppose the probing wave to oscillate at frequency ω and omit
the corresponding term in equations. Radial electric ﬁeld distribution is described by

scattering before (m =
1) and after (m = 1) the cut-oﬀ in respect of the probing
wave propagation. Equations (5) express the fact that one ﬂuctuation can scatter the
wave only once. The situation, for example, when the wave with ﬁxed ky is forward
scattered oﬀ the ﬂuctuation far from the cut-oﬀ and the same wave can be scattered
backward oﬀ the same ﬂuctuation near the cut-oﬀ is impossible. This circumstance
will allow us below to separate the contributions of forward and backward scattering
processes.

2.2. Scattering signal analysis: integration over ky

We calculate the integral over ky in (6) using saddle point method.
It is especially
eﬃcient if the cut-oﬀ is far enough from the antenna and does not coincide with the
focal point of the antenna beam, so that the ray tracing consideration is applicable.
In this case the saddle point k∗

formulated below.

In this “ray tracing” case the stationary phase condition

assumed to be situated in the axes origin, it is easy to show that (13) determines a
ray trajectory which returns to the proper point of the antenna wavefront after the
scattering oﬀ the ﬂuctuation with wavevector (κ, q).

It can be seen that the contributions of the BS before (m=n=-1) and after (m=n=1)
the cut-oﬀ have diﬀerent amplitudes due to the diﬀraction eﬀect dependence on length
of the ray trajectory from emitting to receiving antenna.

Spatial and Wavenumber Resolution of Doppler Reﬂectometry

We consider main features of the BS eﬃciency (21) obtained. The ﬁrst factor
determining the localization of BS signal which appears to be typical for the ﬂuctuation
reﬂectometry [9] is k−2(x). Just recently [9] the same factor was revealed in analysis of
correlation matrix of phase perturbations of ﬂuctuation reﬂectometry signal in nonlinear
regime. It is maximal in the vicinity of the cut-oﬀ where in the WKB approximation
it has singularity. This singularity saturation will be treated in details in section 3.
This maximum explained by the growth of the probing and scattered wave electric ﬁled
in the cut-oﬀ provides the technique with spatial localization, however, the decay of
k−2(x) when leaving cut-oﬀ is not fast enough to guarantee suppression of the signal
coming from wide edge region. Moreover, for quite a few density proﬁles (e.g.
linear
and bent down ones) the integral of k−2(x) over x does not converge due to far from the
cut-oﬀ regions. So plasma periphery contribution can be essential in these cases. The
illustration of this eﬀect is given in section 4.

Additional possibility to increase selectively the BS signal coming from the cut-
oﬀ can be provided by focusing the beam of probing and receiving antennae to the
cut-oﬀ region. This corresponds to
= Λ0 in (21). In this case the focusing causes
additional growth at the cut-oﬀ of probing and scattered wave amplitudes leading to the
scattered signal enhancement similar to that predicted for the cut-oﬀ or upper hybrid
resonance [10].

R

The two mentioned eﬀects increasing the probing wave electric ﬁeld substantially in
the cut-oﬀ should enhance the locality of the Doppler reﬂectometry diagnostics making
it less sensitive to the backscattering in the edge plasma.

The backscattering locality can be also better for some ﬂuctuation radial
wavenumber spectra. One can see from (21) that if the short-scale ﬂuctuations are
suppressed enough in the spectrum the backscattering contribution will be essential in
the cut-oﬀ vicinity only.

density proﬁle. If the cut-oﬀ is not close to the focal point, so that ρ

≪
the expression (22) for the FS contribution appears to be valid where nonlinear
corrections to k2(x) are still small. Closer to the cut-oﬀ where inequality (24) is not
satisﬁed the contribution of the branching point to the integral in (17) is important.
It is calculated below taking into account that the density proﬁle in this region can be
treated as linear. The corresponding contribution doubles the result for the FS signal.
Similar to (21) FS eﬃciency (22) is also proportional to k−2(x). However unlike (21)
the cut-oﬀ contribution is not enhanced there by probing wave focusing. In this case
the focusing merely compensates the refraction of probing beam leading to FS signal
amplitude growth in all plasma volume.
It can be seen from (22) that FS signal is
contributed to by long-scale ﬂuctuations, which disable the third possible localizing
factor discussed for BS — turbulence spectrum.

ω/[c(Λ0 − R

Nevertheless, according to (22), (23) the extra localization of the forward scattering
can be due to the fact that FS signal coming from plasma volume is received in Doppler
reﬂectometry is received by the antenna pattern periphery. Supposing gaussian antenna
beam to be wide enough, the integration over q yields the following estimation of the

Thus the factor describing the antenna pattern eﬀect decreases rapidly in moving oﬀ
the cut-oﬀ under condition the beam is wide enough or suﬃciently tilted. If the antenna
beam focusing to the cut-oﬀ is provided this localizing factor can be even more essential.

3. Scattering signal in the cut-oﬀ vicinity

The explicit expressions for the scattering eﬃciency (21), (22) were obtained in the
previous section using WKB and ray tracing consideration. These expressions possesses

It is necessary to move cut-oﬀ deep inside the plasma (spectra 4, 5) to provide the
dominance of the region behind the velocity step point. Thus poor locality of Doppler
reﬂectometry associated with bend down density proﬁle in this situation can obscure
the velocity distribution.

Diagnostics localization dependence on plasma density proﬁle is also demonstrated
by the next example simulating a transport barrier. We consider plasma density
proﬁle (ﬁgure 5(a)) bent down in plasma periphery and bent up in the core. The
poloidal velocity proﬁle has high gradient in the “barrier” region (ﬁgure 5(b)). One can
see that up to cut-oﬀ position 3 frequency spectrum shift (see spectra 1–3, ﬁgure 5(c))
accords to negative poloidal rotation velocity corresponding to the plasma periphery.
But on crossing the twist point by the cut-oﬀ position the signal grows and the frequency
shift changes to that corresponding to the local value of the velocity in the cut-oﬀ region
(cf. spectra 4, 5, ﬁgure 5(c) and ﬁgure 5(d)). This illustrates the better locality of the
method when used on bent up density proﬁle.

To illustrate antenna focusing inﬂuence we consider the density proﬁle of DIII-D
tokamak plasma with internal transport barrier (ﬁgure 6(a)) [12]. Here we take into
account the distance between antenna and the plasma, which was assumed to be
equal 1 m, and suppose that the probing is performed with narrow antenna beam

the turbulence suppression in the barrier region (see ﬁgure 6(b)). Despite the fact that
density proﬁle in the barrier region is favorable for the diagnostics, antenna focusing
makes the spectrum shift more adequate to the behavior of plasma velocity in the cut-oﬀ.

5. Discussion

First of all we discuss the frameworks of approximations used.
In this paper we
consider Doppler reﬂectometry in slab plasma geometry. As it was mentioned in
section 1 this model is reliable for large vertically elongated plasma. The eﬀects of
cylindricalness become important when the probing beam width in the cut-oﬀ vicinity
is comparable with the cut-oﬀ surface curvature radius which takes place in small
toroidal devices or in case of probing of plasma central regions. These cases of essentially
cylindrical plasma geometry were considered numerically in [13] and analytically (for
speciﬁc plasma density proﬁles) in [14]. In these papers rather obvious conclusion was
obtained that plasma poloidal curvature enhances the diagnostics sensitivity to the
ﬂuctuations with high poloidal wavenumbers. Another cylindrical geometry eﬀect was
investigated numerically in [15] where strong inﬂuence of the plasma cylindricalness on
the diagnostics locality was demonstrated.

Essential can be the plasma poloidal curvature inﬂuence on the focused antenna
beam. In the present paper it was neglected, which is correct, when the focus radial shift
due to refraction associated with the plasma curvature is less than radial ﬂuctuation

d

correlation length ℓcx. This criterion can be represented in form

2Λ0

< ℓcx

xc
r0

Here Λ0 is the ray trajectory length from the antenna to cut-oﬀ, which was deﬁned above,
xc is the distance between the antenna and the cut-oﬀ and r0 is the plasma radius in
poloidal plane. Roughly this criterion can be approximated as x2
c/r0 . ℓcx. When it fails
to hold to provide the focusing to the cut-oﬀ the probing wavefront curvature radius
should be calculated taking into account plasma poloidal curvature. All the mentioned
eﬀects will be taken into account in separate paper of the authors.

Additionally it should be noted that 2D plasma geometry eﬀects like cylindricalness
are not a priory signiﬁcant in reﬂectometry (see e.g.
[9, 16, 17], where it was
demonstrated both analytically [9] and numerically [16, 17] that 2D theory predictions
for radial correlation reﬂectometry are similar to conclusions of simple 1D model).

The second essential assumption made in the paper is associated with linear
character of the scattering signal formation. According to [18] this approximation is
correct when following criterion is satisﬁed
ω2xcℓcx
c2

xc
ℓcx ≪

(36)

ln

δn2
n2
c

Here δn is r.m.s amplitude of the turbulence and nc denotes the density in the cut-
oﬀ. It can be seen that (36) can be violated in case of high ﬂuctuation amplitude or
long trajectory length. In this case probing wave multi-scattering should be taken into
account. This situation can be treated analytically by the procedure using in [18] and it
will be done in the paper by the authors which is now under preparation for submission.
For diagnostics results interpretation it is important to distinguish linear and
nonlinear situation. To do that experimentally one can use additional acquisition
antenna (antenna 2 in ﬁgure 1) which receives the wave reﬂected from the cut-
oﬀ.
If the specular component persists in the frequency spectrum measured by this
additional antenna the distortions of the probing wave in propagation are weak and
we deal with linear situation of single-scattering.
In the opposite case when the line
at probing frequency is lost in the broadened reﬂection spectrum these distortions
due to propagation in turbulent plasma lead to extinction of the specular component,
which indicates transition to nonlinear small-angle multi-scattering regime. This way of
experimental conﬁrmation seems to be reliable but needs additional access to plasma. If
it is impossible some information can be obtained from the form of Doppler reﬂectometry
spectrum received by antenna 1 in ﬁgure 1. If the frequency spectrum width is consistent
2√2v/ρ) one can
with estimation made based on the antenna pattern width (δω
∼
conclude that the signal most likely resulted from single-scattering.

The scattering eﬃciency introduced and analytically obtained (21), (22) in the
paper reveals main similarities and diﬀerences of conventional reﬂectometry and Doppler
technique. In the both methods scattering signal is proportional to reversed square of
probing wavenumber [9]. That provides the diagnostics with spatial localization, which
can be rather poor in case of unfavorable density proﬁle.

Spatial and Wavenumber Resolution of Doppler Reﬂectometry

21

The back-scattering signal component formation is similar for tilted probing, which
is performed in Doppler technique and normal probing which is speciﬁc for conventional
method. In particular, in both cases the probing wave focusing to the cut-oﬀ, according
to (21), underlines the cut-oﬀ region contribution and should improve the diagnostics
localization.
It is worth mentioning that utilization of non-slab probing wave fronts
have been already discussed in [3, 19, 20], however in these papers the front curvature
was chosen close to the cut oﬀ surface curvature in order to improve the Doppler
reﬂectometry wave number resolution [3, 20], or to reduce the 2D interference eﬀects
in the signals reﬂected from diﬀerent parts of corrugated cut oﬀ surface [19]. Finally it
should be noted that 2D-focusing onto the cut-oﬀ surface, which can be easily realized in
experiment, can provide even better localization than 1D-focusing only possible within
2D model considered in the present paper.

Essential are the peculiarities of FS eﬃciency (22). Both for Doppler and
conventional reﬂectometry the cut-oﬀ contribution to the FS component is received by
q/2. However the suppression of
the most favorable part of the antenna diagram ky =
the signal coming from the plasma volume in the case of conventional reﬂectometry takes
place only for ﬂuctuations satisfying condition qρ
1, at which the cut oﬀ contribution
≫
is suppressed as well. For longer poloidal scales q−1
ρ the suppression is not eﬃcient
and additional localization is not possible. On contrary for Doppler reﬂectometry due
to the tilted probing the FS component of the signal, coming from the plasma volume
is suppressed providing the following condition is fulﬁlled

It can be easily achieved by large enough antenna tilt angle or beam width, or by the
focusing to the cut-oﬀ, thus making the FS contribution extremely localized to the
cut-oﬀ.

Finally we discuss the wavenumber resolution of the Doppler reﬂectometry. The
scattering eﬃciency obtained (21), (21) demonstrates that diagnostics possess practically
no radial wavenumber resolution due to the fact that scattering signal is an integral over
radial wavenumbers and small κ are pronounced with weight function 1/κ. Poloidal
wavenumber resolution can be easily estimated and is determined by antenna pattern
width. For BS contribution it can be represented as

6. Conclusion

FS poloidal wavenumber resolution can be √2 times worse.

In the present paper the Doppler reﬂectometry spatial and wavenumber resolution is
analyzed in the framework of the linear Born approximation in slab plasma model. The
results obtained provide realistic description of Doppler reﬂectometry experiment in
large elongated plasma at low level of density perturbation.

Explicit expression for

the backscattering spectrum is obtained in terms
of wavenumber and frequency spectra of turbulence assumed to be statistically
inhomogeneous in radial direction. The treatment is performed for arbitrary density
proﬁle and antenna pattern taking into account diﬀraction eﬀects. In agreement with [3]
it is demonstrated that the signal consists of contributions of back and forward scattering
in radial direction, which take place both before and after the reﬂection of the probing
wave in the turning point. Similar to the traditional ﬂuctuation reﬂectometry [9]
the scattering eﬃciency for both back and forward scattering is shown to be inverse
proportional to the square of radial wavenumber of the probing wave at the ﬂuctuation
location thus making the spatial resolution of diagnostics sensitive to the density proﬁle.
It is shown that additional localization is provided in case of forward scattering in the
radial direction by the antenna diagram and in case of backscattering by the fact that
the turbulence spectrum is suppressed at high radial wavenumbers. The improvement
of the diagnostics locality by probing beam focusing onto the cut-oﬀ surface is proposed
described as well.

It is demonstrated that analytical expressions obtained can be easily used for
fast interpretation of Doppler reﬂectometry data in particular for estimation of this
diagnostics locality. They can as well serve for benchmarking and testing of full wave
numerical codes developed for interpretation of conventional ﬂuctuation reﬂectometry
data [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21], should the authors consider the application of these codes
to the ﬁeld of Doppler reﬂectometry.

The magnetic surfaces curvature, if important, can be accounted for within the same
theoretical approach applied to cylindrical plasma geometry. The nonlinear eﬀects in
Doppler reﬂectometry spectra formation becoming signiﬁcant in large devices and at
high density perturbation level can be described within WKB approximation in the way
similar to one used in [18].

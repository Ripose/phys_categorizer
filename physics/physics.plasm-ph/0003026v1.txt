R. Singh and M. P. Bora∗

Instabilities of ion-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma with electron-drift, collisional, and dust
charge ﬂuctuations eﬀects, have been investigated. The regimes are clearly marked out where the
theory is applicable. The critical electron-drift velocity required to drive the instability is predicted.
It is also shown that electron thermal conductivity and charged grains concentration enhance the
growth of the ion-acoustic mode whereas ion-viscosity, ion-thermal conductivity, and dust charge
ﬂuctuations have a stabilizing eﬀect.

I. INTRODUCTION

Dusty plasmas have acquired considerable importance1
because of their applications to astrophysics and plan-
etary physics2, problems of plasma processing3, and
physics of strongly coupled systems4. Experimentally,
one of the important areas of investigation is the study
of low frequency (ω ≤ Ωi) ﬂuctuations in a plasma with
dust grains. In a recent experiment by Barkan et al.5, it
is shown that the phase velocity of ion-acoustic wave in-
creases with the density of negatively charged dust grains
and thus ion Landau damping becomes less severe in a
plasma with charged dust grains5 or with negative ions6.
The ion-acoustic wave is a typical compressional mode
in which ions provide the inertia and electrons bring in
the pressure eﬀects through their shielding cloud. In a
magnetized plasma, it propagates with acoustic phase
speed along the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Earlier, the ki-
netic theory of the current-driven ion-acoustic instabil-
ity, in a fully ionized, collisional7,8 and collisionless9 two-
component plasma, has been investigated by various au-
thors.
In the limit of strong collisions (i.e. mean free
path smaller than the wavelength), Coppi et al.10 and
Rognlien et al.11 have used the two-ﬂuid equations for
an investigation of the current-driven ion-acoustic insta-
bility. Kulsrud and Shen12 have investigated the eﬀect
of weak collisions on ion-acoustic wave using a Fokker-
Plank model, while St´efant13 used kinetic theory and a
collision integral of Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook type to show
that ion-viscosity leads to a damping of the ion-acoustic
instability, whereas, the electron-ion collisions tend to in-
crease the growth rate. Recently, Rosenberg7 has carried
out the investigation of current-driven ion wave instabil-
ity in a fully ionized collisionless dusty plasma using ki-
netic theory to predict the critical electron-drift velocity
relative to the ions, required to drive the instability.

Interpretations of ion-acoustic wave excitation in a
dusty plasma experiment have typically relied on the
theories based on collisionless inverse electron Landau
damping10,11. A realistic analysis of the experimental

situation shows that in a typical experimental setup5,6,
the plasma density may be quite high ∼ 109-1010 cm−3
when the plasma temperature is quite low. As an ex-
ample, when plasma density ∼ 1010 cm−3, with elec-
trons and ions having approximately equal temperatures
Te ∼ Ti ∼ 0.1 eV, the electron-ion collision mean free
path (λe) may be comparable or even smaller than the
plasma scale length (L) along the magnetic ﬁeld,
i.e.
λe <
∼ L. Under these conditions, the electrons no longer
follow the Boltzmann relation and a collisionless theory
of the electron-drift driven ion-acoustic instability is not
justiﬁed. It is therefore important to re-examine this ion
wave instability in a collisional dusty plasma. In these
experiments cited above, however, ion-acoustic waves are
launched by applying a sinusoidal voltage to a grid im-
mersed in plasma rather than by drawing an electric
current. Nevertheless, the eﬀect of Coulomb collisions
in presence of current driven ion-acoustic waves in such
a plasma, as is considered in this work, remains to be
seen in a laboratory experiment. In another experiment
by Barkan et al.14, current driven ion-acoustic waves in
a dusty plasma are studied. But, this experiment was
conducted at a relatively low plasma densities ∼ 106-
107 cm−3.

In this paper, we investigate an electron-drift (or elec-
tron current) driven ion-acoustic mode in the presence of
negatively charged dust grains. The dust charged grains
are considered to be massive particles in a multicompo-
nent plasma. This is valid when a ≪ d ≪ λD, where
a is the average dust radius, d is the average distance
between the dust particles, and λD is the plasma Debye
length.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec.II, the
regimes of interest, where the theory is applicable are
discussed. Sec.III deals with the linear instability theory.
Sec.IV contains the conclusions.

II. REGIMES OF INTEREST

At ﬁrst, we refer to regimes of interest where the
present calculations are relevant. We consider a typi-
cal experimental situation such as considered in exper-
iments by Barkan et al.5,14 and Song et al.6.
In such
conditions, the typical parameters in these experiments
are : potassium plasma (K+) with mi/mp ∼ 40, mi and
mp being the ion and proton masses respectively, dust
mass md ∼ 10−12 gm, gas pressure <
∼ 10−5 Torr, the
corresponding neutral (n) density nn ≃ 2 × 1011 cm−3,
equal electron (e) and ion (i) temperatures Te ∼ Ti ∼
0.1 eV, and dust grain temperature Td ∼ 0.03 eV (as-
sumed to be at room temperature). The plasma is
conﬁned radially by a magnetic ﬁeld B ∼ 0.4 T and
the plasma length along the magnetic ﬁeld L ∼ 40 cm
with a radius rp ∼ 2 cm for the plasma column. The
characteristic frequency of the waves f ∼ 20-80 kHz
which corresponds to ω = 2πf ∼ 1-5×105 rad/s. The
other plasma parameters are : electron-thermal veloc-
ity ce = (Te/me)1/2 ∼ 1.3 × 107 cm/s, ion-thermal ve-
locity ci = (Ti/mi)1/2 ∼ 5 × 104 cm/s, the ion-acoustic
speed cs = (Te/mi)1/2 ∼ 5 × 104 cm/s, the dust-thermal
velocity cd = (Td/md)1/2 ∼ 2 cm/s, the ion gyrofre-
quency Ωi = eB/mic ∼ 106 s−1, the ion Larmor radius
ai = ci/Ωi ∼ 7 × 10−2 cm, the collision frequency of
electrons and ions with the neutrals νen = nnσence ∼
1.3 × 104 s−1, νin = nnσinci ∼ 50 s−1 (where σin ∼ σen ∼
5 × 10−15 cm2), with the corresponding mean free paths
λen ∼ λin ∼ 103 cm. The e-i collision frequency (νei)
and i-i collision frequency (νii) in the form presented
by Braginskii9 are calculated for the present parameters
and are found to be as νei = 1/τe ∼ 8.4 × 106 s−1 and
νii = 1/τi ∼ 2.8 × 104 s−1 and the mean free paths are
λe = ce/νei ∼ 1 cm and λi = ci/νii ∼ 1 cm, where τe =
3.5 × 104T 3/2
i0 /nλ,
and λ = 23.4 − 1.15 log n + 3.45 log T ∼ 9.5 (for T <
50 eV) is the Coulomb logarithm.

e0 /nλ, τi = 3.0 × 106(mi/2mp)1/2T 3/2

From these calculations the following assumptions can

now be made
(1) the collision mean free paths of electrons and ions
are comparable to or even smaller than the plasma
scale length along the magnetic ﬁeld i.e. λe,i < L,
so that we can make use of Braginskii’s ﬂuid equa-
tions,

(2) since ω < νei, we can neglect the electron inertia,
(3) since ai < rp and assuming a homogeneous plasma,
the ion motion transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld can
be neglected (the polarization drift),

(4) since νei ≫ νen, νed and νii ≫ νin, νid, so the mo-
mentum and energy losses of electrons and ions to
the neutrals and dust grains can also be neglected
in the ﬂuid equations,

(5) since the phase velocity of the observed ion-acoustic
wave is much larger than the dust-thermal speed
i.e. vp ≫ cd, we can neglect the dust dynamics
in the analysis. However, we shall incorporate the
self-consistent ﬂuctuation of charge on dust grains,

which is shown to cause a damping eﬀect on the
ion-acoustic wave15,16. The charge ﬂuctuation on
the surface of the dust grains, which depends cru-
cially on the dust size and the plasma density, is
important when charging rate is comparable to the
growth of the mode.

(6) we consider negatively charged grains as an addi-
tional charged plasma species of uniform massive
particles similar to a multicomponent plasma. This
remains valid as long as a ≪ d ≪ λD.

III. INSTABILITY ANALYSIS

We write down the basic equations in order to de-
rive the linear dispersion relation of electron-drift driven
ion-acoustic wave instability including the eﬀects of
dust charge ﬂuctuations, electron and ion temperature
perturbations,
ion-viscosity etc. We consider a one-
dimensional, plane, homogeneous plasma with low β
(β = 4πnTe/B2 ≪ 1 is the ratio of kinetic energy to mag-
netic energy). The resultant governing equations for elec-
trons and ions are the Braginskii’s ﬂuid equations viz.,
equations of continuity, momentum, and energy.

We write down the equilibrium equations that deﬁne
this speciﬁc regime of interest and conﬁne ourselves to
the parallel motions only. They are the ion and electron
continuity equations

tion, however, we have neglected the collision term10 in
the limit uik > (me/mi)(νei/ω)uk. We have further ne-
glected the electron viscosity term in Eq.(4). The re-
maining equations are the energy equations9,

We consider a small electrostatic perturbation and lin-
earize the above equations. The linearized equations are,

ions and dust grains. The electrons drift with respect to
the ions and dust particles, so that ui0 = ud0 = 0. The
ion motion along the magnetic ﬁeld B is given by the
linearized parallel momentum equation

is the charge ﬂuctuation, η = e|Ie|(T −1
)/C with
W0 = Ti0 − eφf 0, φf 0 is the potential at the dust surface,
|Ie| ∼ Ii ∼ eni0πa2cs is the equilibrium electron (or ion)
current at the dust surface, and C ∼ a being the grain
capacitance. In writing Eq.(18), we have neglected the

e0 − W −1

dust density ﬂuctuations as the ion transit time (∼ L/cs)
is much shorter than the dust transit time19 [∼ L/cd∗,
cd∗ ∼ (Z 2

d0nd0Ti0/ni0md)1/2] along the magnetic ﬁeld.

It should, however, be noted that in writing the
above equations, we have assumed a stationary back-
ground equilibrium. On the other hand, a non-stationary
background equilibrium may lead to stabilization of the
ion-acoustic instability in a low temperature collisional
plasma20.

We now take perturbations of the form

tio of ne0/ni0) leads to an increase in the phase velocity

In the expression for growth rate of the ion-acoustic
wave Eq.(34), the collisional damping is represented by
the ﬁrst two factors, the parallel ion-viscosity and parallel
ion-thermal conductivity. The third term causes damp-
ing due to charge ﬂuctuation on the surface of the dust
grains, which is proportional to the electron/ion current
( ˆI0) on the dust surface. We note that in absence of
dust charge ﬂuctuation (i.e. ˆI0 = 0), increasing nega-
tively charged dust density with respect to electron and
ion density, results in an increase of the growth rate

ˆγ = γL/cs against normalized wave number ˆk = kkL, as
obtained from the solution of the full dispersion relation
Eq.(31), at diﬀerent negatively charged dust concentra-
tion δ = ne0/ni0. Note that δ = 0.3 means 70% of the
electronic charges is now carried by the massive dust par-
ticles and δ = 1 means no negatively charged dust grains.
The other parameters in Fig.1 are ˆu = uek0/cs = 6,
ˆλ = λi,e/L = 0.01, and ˆI = ˆI0L/cs = 0. As in ion-
acoustic instability without dust particles, the positive
growth rate, here also, appears only when the drifting
electron velocity uek0, exceeds several times the phase
velocity. Therefore, the necessary condition for required
electron-drift relative to ions and negatively charged dust
grains to excite the ion wave instability is

where we have used, only the zeroth order expression
for ωr. Note that the ion-viscosity and ion-thermal con-
ductivity raise the critical electron current for the ion-
acoustic wave to be unstable [the term in the square
bracket in Eq.(35)], whereas the electron-thermal con-
ductivity tends to increase the growth rate, as seen from
Eq.(34).

The eﬀect of increasing negatively charged dust den-
sity on growth rate of the ion-acoustic instability may
be compensated by the presence of charge ﬂuctuation on

5

dust surface, which has a damping eﬀect, as shown in
Fig.2. In Fig.2 we have taken the dust density parame-
ter δ = 0.3. The other parameters are same as in Fig.1.
We show in Fig.3, the behavior of ˆγ versus δ for diﬀerent
values of dust current ˆI = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 1.0. Other
parameters chosen are ˆu = 6, ˆλ = 0.01, and ˆk = 5.0. The
overall behavior is consistent with Fig.1 and Fig.2.

rent increases. The normalized wave number ˆk = 5.0, ˆu = 6.0,
and ˆλe,i = 0.01.

However, it is important to note that, although a de-
creasing δ causes peaking up of the growth rate, at any
given wave number, a rapid dust charge ﬂuctuation rate
(larger ˆI0) causes the wave to damp at higher dust con-
centration, which is opposite in behavior to the case of
absence of dust charge ﬂuctuation (Fig.1 and 2), as can
be seen from all the curves in Fig.3.

For typical experimental parameters ne0/ni0 ∼ 0.3,
Zd0nd0/ni0 ∼ 0.7, Te0 ∼ Ti0, and νei/νii ∼ (mi/me)1/2,
the necessary threshold condition for instability reduces
to

It is to be noted that the eﬀects of charge ﬂuctuation at
the dust surface will tend to play an important role when
the mean free paths are comparable to the plasma length
along the magnetic ﬁeld and the term

The condition (36) can be realized in typical labora-
tory situations5. For example, with an average size of
dust grains to be few microns (a ∼ 10−4 cm) and a cor-
responding Zd0 ∼ 104, the condition (36) yields

for the excitation of the ion-acoustic instability, where
we have taken the collisional parameters as λe,i/L ≃ 0.01
and ˆk = kkL ∼ 2. The typical parallel electric ﬁeld re-
quired for the corresponding threshold electron current
is ∼ 0.1 V/m.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the ion-acoustic instability in a col-
lisional dusty plasma with ﬂuid equations, where dust
grains are treated as massive and negatively charged com-
ponent in a multicomponent plasma. The regimes are
clearly marked out where the theory is applicable, espe-
cially in a relatively high density (1010 cm−3) and low
temperature plasma where the eﬀect of collisions cannot
be neglected. While treating the negatively charged dust
particles, we take into account the eﬀect of charge ﬂuctu-
ation on the dust surface. We have shown that in such a
plasma, which are routinely produced in laboratory, there
is a signiﬁcant impact of electron-ion collisions, even at
large mean free paths (i.e. λf >
∼ L). We have derived the
threshold electron-drift velocity required to drive the ion-
acoustic instability. It is shown that the electron-thermal
conductivity and the dust charge concentrations reduce
the threshold value of electron current for driving the ion-
acoustic mode. In particular, the ion-viscosity and ion-
thermal conductivity raise the threshold current. And a
similar eﬀect due to dust charge ﬂuctuations is also found
when the mean free paths are of the order of the plasma
length.

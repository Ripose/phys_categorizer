I. INTRODUCTION

It is well-known that neutral beam injection is one of the fundamental fusion plasma heating methods. In general,
a particle accelerator is used to create fast ion beams (the particle energies are on the order of 100 keV); the ion beam
is then passed through a neutral gas region, where the ions neutralize via charge-exchange reactions with the neutral
gas. The neutralized beam is then injected into a magnetically conﬁned plasma. Of course, the neutral atoms are
unaﬀected (not conﬁned) by the magnetic ﬁeld, but ionize as they penetrate into the plasma. Then the high-energy
ions transfer fraction of their energy to the plasma particles in repeated collisions, and heat the plasma [1–6].

In this paper we develop a kinetic model of three component, weakly ionized, collisional plasma with a beam of
neutral particles. We employ a kinetic equation for the charged particles of α sort in the weakly ionized plasma with
the Batnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model collisional term. Similar model has been developed previously by others [7].
In this book authors do not take into account possibility of existence of regular velocity of the neutral particles [7]. In
the light of the possible relevance of our model for the heating of plasma by neutral beam injection, we set out with
the aim to generalize results of Ref. [7] by allowing neutral particles to have regular velocity and seek for possible
novelties brought about by this eﬀect. Indeed, the dispersion relations for linear perturbations obtained in this paper
diﬀer substantially from those of Ref. [7].

In section II we formulate our model and obtain general dispersion relation.

In section III we analyze various

limiting cases of the dispersion relation and discuss the results.

II. THE MODEL

We start analysis of the dielectric permittivity (DP) of a collosional plasma with weakly ionzed, non-degenerate
plasma when the integral of elastic collisions in the kinetic equation for the charged particles can be apporximated
by the BGK term, while it is possible to neglect the collisions between the chaged particles themselvs. Analysis of
this relatively simple model will be useful for further more complicated case of fully ionized plasma (which, in fact, is
more relevant for the fusion plasma). The latter is beyond the scope of present paper and the separate analysis needs
to be done.

The kinetic equation for the charged particles of α sort in the weakly ionized plasma with the BGK model collisional

term can be written as following [7]:

It should be emphasized that the BGK collisonal integral describes accurately collisions only particles of diﬀerent
sort. Therefore, it can be used to describe collisions of charged paricles with the neutrals in weakly ionized plasma,
when the scatteing of charged particles on the neutrals is a dominant process. In the case of fully ionized plasma, in
spite of its relative simplicity, use of BGK integral is not justiﬁed [7].

R

In what follows, we consider isothermal models of the BGK integral, i.e. we neglect change in temperature of
charged particles with chage in their corresponding distribution functions. We ought to mention that the results
obtained here will be qualitatively the same for the non-isothermal model of BGK integral. We further assume that
M and Ti = Tn. In this case
the masses and the temperatures of the ions and neutrals do coincide, i.e. mi = Mn ≡
to the order of
me/M terms we have Ten = Te. Thus, in the Eq.(2), under these simplifying assumptions we can

set Tαn = Tα and

which, in fact, coincides with the Maxwellian distribution function (with the beam having velocity ~V0) normalized to
unity.

In the static equilibrium state, with the external ﬁelds absent, Eq.(1) allows for the only solution f0α = N0αΦ0n.

In what follows subscript 0 will denote unperturbed and δ perturbation of the physical quantities.

Let us consider small perturbation of the distribution function δfα which is caused by appearance of small ﬁelds ~E

III. DISCUSSION

Let us start analysis of the obtained results from longitudinal waves as we have seen that transverse waves do not
incur any modiﬁcation by the presence of the beem of neutral particles. The dispersion relation for the longitudinal

the most interesting ones which correspond to weakly damped oscillations.

Here, we neglect the contribution from ions, because it is signiﬁcant when Ti ≥
of ions is greater than the temperature of electrons by more than six orders of magnitude. It is unlikely that such
diﬀerences in the temperatures actually do realize in the nature [7]. Therefore, in the frequency domain concerned,
the plasma can be considered as a purely electronic, i.e. the role of the ions is reduced only to neutralize the charge
of electrons. The dispersion relation (26) has to imaginary terms. The ﬁrst one describes collisionless Cherenkov
absorption of the plasma waves. Whereas, the second one has purely collisional nature and describes dissipation of
the ﬁelds energy in via collisions (electronic friction) [7]. The diﬀerence induced by the presence of the beam of neutral
particles is presented by a factor (see, Ref. [7] for comparison)

Again, we note that the diﬀerence induced by the presence of the beam of neutral particles is presented by a factor

given by factor Eq.(27) (see, Ref. [7] for comparison).

This concludes presentaion of the kinetic model of three component, weakly ionized, collisional plasma with a beam
of neutral particles. We have generalized the results of Ref. [7] by allowing neutral particles to have regular velocity
(i.e. by allowing for the existence of a beam of neutrals). We have shown that the novel, generalized dispersion
relations for linear perturbations obtained in this paper diﬀer substantially from those of Ref. [7]. Finally, we would
like to conclude outlining, once again, the possible relevance of our model for the better understanding of the plasma
heating process by a neutral beam injection.

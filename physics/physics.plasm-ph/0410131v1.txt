In the present analysis we study the self consistent propagation of nonlinear electromagnetic pulses
in a one dimensional relativistic electron-ion plasma, from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics.
We show how a series of Hamiltonian bifurcations give rise to the electric ﬁelds which are of relevance
in the subject of particle acceleration. Connections between these bifurcated solutions and results
of earlier analysis are made.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Propagation of intense electromagnetic pulses in plas-
mas is a subject of current interest in a variety of ar-
eas that make use of the available modern laser tech-
nologies, among which we include particle and photon
acceleration, nonlinear optics, laser fusion, and others
Intense electromagnetic pulses dis-
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
place plasma electrons and creates a resulting ambipo-
lar electric ﬁeld with the associated density ﬁelds. Un-
der appropriate conditions all ﬁelds act coherently and
the pulse keeps it shape. Studies on pulse localization
have been performed in a variety of forms to unravel
the corresponding numerical and analytical properties.
Kozlov et al.
[7] investigate numerically propagation of
coupled electromagnetic and electrostatic modes in cold
relativistic electron-ion plasmas to conclude that small
and large amplitude localized solutions can be present.
Moﬁz & de Angelis [8] apply analytical approximations
to the same model and suggest where and how localized
solutions can be obtained. Ensuing, more recent works
provide even deeper understanding as various features
are investigated, like inﬂuence of ion motion in slow, ion
accelerating solitons [9], existence of moving solitons [5],
existence of trails lagging isolated pulses [10, 11] and oth-
ers. Some key points however remain not quite under-
stood, like the way small amplitude localized solutions
are destroyed; when isolated pulses are actually free of
smaller amplitude trails; and more speciﬁc properties of
the spectrum of stronger amplitude solutions, to mention
some. Those are issues of relevance if one wishes to es-
tablish the existence range and stability properties of the
localized modes.

In the present paper we shall turn our attention to
small amplitude solitons propagating in underdense rar-
iﬁed plasmas, since these kind of solitons may be of rele-
vance for wakeﬁeld schemes. In doing so we shall follow
an alternative strategy, other than the direct integration
of the governing equations which has been the standard
approach so far. We intend to examine the problem with
techniques of nonlinear dynamics [12]. A canonical repre-
sentation shall be constructed in association with several

∗rizzato@if.ufrgs.br

tools of nonlinear dynamics like Poincar´e maps and sta-
bility matrices. This strategy naturally provides a clear
way to investigate the system since we intend to estab-
lish connection between the pulses of radiation and ﬁxed
points of the corresponding nonlinear dynamical system
[13]. Several facts are known and we state some which are
of direct relevance for our analysis: small amplitude soli-
tons are created as the wave system becomes modulation-
ally unstable at an upper limit of the carrier frequency
and cease to exist beyond a lower limit of this carrier
frequency. Not much is known on how solitons are de-
stroyed at the lower boundary and we examine this point
to show that a series of nonlinear resonances and bifurca-
tions are responsible for process. A related relevant prob-
lem is when isolated pulses are actually free of smaller
amplitude trails and this has to do with the existence of
wakeﬁelds following the leading wave front which is of
relevance for particle acceleration, for instance. Those
are basic issues if one wishes to operate the wave system
under conditions suited for particle acceleration, and our
purpose with the present paper is to contribute towards
the analysis of these aspects.

II. THE MODEL

→

We follow previous works and model our system as
consisting of two cold relativistic ﬂuids: one electronic,
the other ionic. Electromagnetic radiation propagates
along the z axis of our coordinate system and we rep-
resent the relevant ﬁelds in the dimensionless forms
eA(z, t)/mec2
A(z, t) for the laser vector potential,
→
and eφ(z, t)/mec2
φ(z, t) for the electric potential.
e is the electron charge, me its mass, and c is the speed
−
of light; mi will denote ionic mass when appropriate. In
addition, we suppose stationary modulations of a circu-
larly polarized carrier wave for the vector potential in the
form A(z, t) = ψ( ˜ξ)[ˆx sin(kz
ωt)] with
˜ξ
V t, whereupon introducing the expression for
the vector potential into the governing Maxwell’s equa-
tion one readily obtains V = c2k/ω. V could be thus read
as a nonlinear group velocity since we shall be working in
regimes where ω and k are related by a nonlinear disper-
sion relation. Manipulation of the governing equations
ﬁnally takes us to the point where two coupled equations
must be integrated - one controlling the vector potential,

relation for electromagnetic waves. What we expect to
see are small amplitude waves when ω is slightly smaller
than ω∗, with amplitudes increasing as we move farther
from the threshold. In addition to that, another feature
worth of notice must be commented. If one sits very close
to the threshold, amplitude modulations of the laser ﬁeld
are tremendously slow, while the oscillatory frequency
of the electric potential φ remains relatively high. The
resulting frequency disparity provides the conditions for
a slow adiabatic dynamics where, given a slowly varying
ψ, φ always accommodates itself close to the minimum

the “minus” sign on the right hand side accounting for
the negative eﬀective mass of φ as seen in Eq. (5); note
that φmin of Eq. (6) refers to the smallest available φ and
not to the minimum of U . When ψ = 0, a condition to
be used shortly in our Poincar´e plots, U has a minimum
at φ = 0 which is thus a stable point in the adiabatic
regime. As one moves away from the threshold, faster
modulations and higher amplitudes may be expected to
introduce considerable amounts of nonintegrable behav-
ior and chaos into the system. This kind of perspec-
tive agrees well with the result of previous works where
adiabatic regions have been interpreted to be essentially
associated with small amplitude quasineutral dynamics
[7]. One of our interests here is to precisely see how the
adiabatic dynamics is broken as one moves deeper into
nonintegrable regimes. An additional fact must be ob-
served as one searches for adiabatic solutions and this
has to do with how close to the minimum of U on must
sit so as to ﬁnd these adiabatic solutions. The corre-
sponding discussion parallels that on wave breaking of
relativistic eletrostatic waves. First of all note that if
we do not set φ right at the respective minimum of U ,
the electric potential will oscillate around the minimum
which will be itself displaced due to the action of the
slowly varying ψ. Again when ψ = 0, inequality (6) re-
veals that φ must lie in the range φmin = √p
1 < 0 to
√p) > 0. Not all these values are how-
φmax = 1/µ(1
ever actually allowed in adiabatic dynamics. Oscillations
will occur consistently only if the orbit is free to wander
to the right and left hand sides of the minimum φ = 0
and this can only happen when the oscillating orbit is
entirely trapped within the attracting well of U . U < 0,
and a quick calculation shows that

so U (φmax) > U (φmin), which sets a limit to cyclic or-

will never be above the level U (φmin). To illustrate all
these comments, the reader is referred to Fig. 1 where

separating regions I and II. Our conclusion is that even
with extremely slow modulations, oscillations of φ must
be limited so as to satisfy the conditions discussed above.
Not only that, but the very same ﬁgure suggests how non-
integrability aﬀects localization of our solutions: as one
moves away from adiabaticity and into chaotic regimes,
trajectories initially trapped by U may be expected to
chaotically diﬀuse towards upper levels of this eﬀective
potential, escaping from the trapping region, approach-
ing Ewbr and eventually hitting the boundary at φmin
or, in general, attaining re = 0 for ψ
= 0. If this is so,
we have an explanation on how small amplitude solitons
are destroyed, one of the issues of interest in the subject
[5]. We now look at the problem with help of methods of
nonlinear dynamics.

III. ANALYSIS WITH NONLINEAR
DYNAMICS

We introduce our Hamiltonian phase space in the
form of a Ponicar´e surface of section mapping where the
pair of variables (φ, Pφ) is recorded each time the plane
ψ = 0 is punctured with Pψ < 0. Once we have de-
ﬁned the map this way, we can also investigate the ex-
istence and stability of periodic solutions of our coupled
set of equations with the aid of a Newton-Raphson al-
gorithm. The Newton-Raphson method locates periodic
orbits and evaluates the corresponding stability index α
< (>)1 for stable (unstable) trajecto-
which satisﬁes
ries [14]. Parameters are represented in a form already
used in earlier investigations on the subject: we ﬁrst
set a numerical value for V0 and then obtain ω = 1/V0

α

|

0 ω2

e /ω2 = V 2

which must be larger than the unity as demanded by
condition (9). However, we shall keep Vo close to the
unit, and thus ω slightly larger than one, so as to rep-
resent wave modes propagating nearly at the speed of
light. This is the convenient setting if one is interested
in fast electron acceleration by wakeﬁelds. After Vo is
established, the electron plasma frequency is calculated
e = ηω2, η satisfying condition (9) again. We note
as ω2
e,nonscaled/c2k2, so hold-
0 ω2
e = V 2
that η = ω2
ing V0 constant while increasing η, is entirely equivalent
to the more usual practice of holding V0 and the orig-
inal ωe, while decreasing k and the original ω.
In all
cases analyzed here we take µ = 0.0005 as in Kozlov et
al [7]. In addition to that, we shall take Vo = 0.99 to rep-
resent the high speed conditions of wakeﬁeld schemes.
Now a crucial step is this: since isolated pulses cannot
be seen in periodic plots we alter slightly the energy E
to E = V0/p2(1 + 1/ µ) (1 + ǫ), ǫ
1 so the vanishing
tail Pψ = Pφ = ψ = φ = 0 is avoided. With this maneu-
ver we convert isolated pulses into trains of quasi-isolated
pulses, a situation amenable to the use of nonlinear dy-
namics and the associated periodic plots; periodicity is
in fact physically meaningful if pulses result from peri-
odic self-modulations of initially uniform modes [15]. In
all cases we make sure that as ǫ
0 the trains go into
individual packets and convergence is attained. The in-
stability threshold for the vector potential is obtained in
ω as it must be
the form η∗ = p/(1+µ) = 0.0198 so ωp ≪
in the underdense plasmas. To investigate the adiabatic
regime of the relevant nonlinear dynamics we examine
phase portraits for η slightly larger than η∗. In panel (a)
of Fig. 2 we set η = 1.00001 η∗.

bility, modulations are slow with
approximations are thus fully operative and what we see
in phase space is just a set of concentric KAM surfaces
rendering the system nearly integrable. The central ﬁxed
point corresponds to an isolated periodic orbit since it
represent a phase locked solution that return periodi-
cally to ψ = 0 φ
0, and the surrounding curves de-
pict regimes of quasiperiodic, nonvanishing ﬂuctuations
of φ. Resonant islands are already present but still do
not aﬀect the central region of the phase plot where the
solitary solution resides.
In general we have observed
that increasingly large resonance islands are present away
from the central region. When η grows the behavior of
the central ﬁxed point can be observed in terms of its
stability index represented in Fig. 2(b). The index os-
cillates within the stable range initially, which marks the
existence of a central elliptic point near the origin. The

stability index however ﬁnally reaches α = +1 as indi-
cated in the ﬁgure, beyond which point no orbit is found.
This indicates a tangent bifurcation with a neighbouring
orbit which terminates the existence of the central point
[16]. Immediately after tangency, the phase plot at ψ = 0
is still constricted to small values of φ as seen in Fig. 2(c)
where η = 1.0001η∗. Larger values of η cause diﬀusion
towards upper levels of U (φ) and we can see that in Fig.

This kind of choice allows us to represent in the same

potential, without deforming these quantities when they
are small, near their initial conditions. We found it con-
venient to use χe = χφ = 0.0001 to discuss diﬀusion.
In Fig. 3(a) we take η = 1.00001η∗ so we are in the
regular regime; as expected, no diﬀusion is observed and
the quasi-particle stays near its initial condition Pφ = 0,

ﬁxed point no longer exist.
In addition to that, KAM
surfaces no longer isolate the central region of the phase
plot and diﬀusion is observed. The quasi-particle moves
toward Ewbr and eventually arrives at this critical energy
producing wave breaking on electrons. At this point the
simulation stops with the electron density diverging to
inﬁnity. Diﬀusion is initially slow and becomes faster as
energy increases. One sees voids in the diﬀusion plots
which correspond to resonant islands in the phase space,
so as diﬀusion proceeds the quasi-particle escalates along
the contours of the resonances that become progressively
larger as already mentioned - this is why the process is
initially slow, becoming faster in the ﬁnal stages. For
larger values of η no resonance is present and the quasi-
particle moves quickly toward Ewbr. In case of panel (b)
one can still see various pulses before wave breaking, but
when η is so large that resonances are no longer present,
wave breaking can be instantaneous. We ﬁnally note the
1, it is known that
following relevant fact. For Vo →
the amplitude of the electromagnetic pulses are small [5].
But as one goes beyond the adiabatic regime, our dis-
cussion on diﬀusion allows to conclude that even small
initial pulses eventually reach very high values, which
provides the condition for formation of strong electric
ﬁelds with the corresponding implications on particle ac-
celeration. We illustrate the feature with a ﬁnal ﬁgure,
Fig. 4, where, in a diﬀusive regime with η = 1.0004η∗,
the electric ﬁeld
pPφ is shown to evolve from
small values near initial conditions to the limiting wave
breaking value which agrees with the calculated value

We read all these features as it follows. For small

lated pulses coexisting with surrounding quasiperiodic

As η increases past the inverse tangent bifurcation but
prior to full destruction of isolating KAM surfaces, one
reaches a regime of periodical returns to ψ = 0, although
in the presence of a slightly chaotic φ motion. Those
cases where ψ = 0 but φ
= 0, correspond to quasineutral
ψ pulses accompanied by trails of φ activity as described
in Refs. [10] and [11]. We see that trails can be regular or
chaotic. Finally, for large enough η’s, KAM surfaces no
longer arrest diﬀusion and wave breaking does occur as
0, as we have checked. At this point adiabatic mo-
re →
tion is lost and this is likely to correspond to that point
where small amplitude solitary solutions are entirely de-
stroyed as commented in Refs. [5] and [9].

IV. FINAL CONCLUSIONS

To summarize, we have used tools of nonlinear dy-
namics to examine the problem of wave propagation in
relativistic cold plasmas, discussing underdense regimes
appropriate to wakeﬁeld schemes. Nonlinear dynamics
provides a uniﬁed view on the problem, thus allowing to
address simultaneously several relevant questions. In this
paper we have kept our interest focused on weakly non-
linear modes where a transition from adiabatic to nonin-
tegrable dynamics was observed. Starting with very low
amplitude regimes near the onset of modulational insta-
bility, one has either isolated pulses or pulses coexisting
with regular φ trails. As one increases η, thus moving
away from the onset, pulses with slightly larger amplitude
exist but are never fully isolated since tangent bifurca-
tions annihilate the central ﬁxed point and create ubiq-
uitous chaotic electrostatic trails. However, electrostatic
activity is still surrounded by KAM surfaces and there-
fore conﬁned to small amplitudes. Now as one pushes
amplitudes a little higher, isolating KAM surfaces are
destroyed, pulses are no longer possible at all and wave
breaking does occur. There are therefore three clearly
identiﬁed regimes in the problem: (i) regular or adiabatic
regimes where the dynamics is approximately integrable,
(ii) a weakly chaotic regimes where chaos is present but
chaotic diﬀusion is still absent due to the presence of lin-
gering isolating KAM surfaces, and ﬁnally (iii) diﬀusive
chaotic regimes where isolating KAM surfaces are absent.
Thermal eﬀects should be added All those issues are of
signiﬁcant importance for plasma accelerators and shall
be developed in future publications.

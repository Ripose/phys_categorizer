plasma kinetic codes

Abstract

Validation and veriﬁcation of plasma kinetics codes requires the development of
quantitative methods and techniques for code comparisons. We describe two pa-
rameters that can be used for characterization of diﬀerences between such codes.
It is shown that these parameters, which are determined from the most general re-
sults of kinetic codes, can provide important information on the diﬀerences between
the basic rate coeﬃcients employed. Application of this method is illustrated by
comparisons of some results from the 3rd NLTE Code Comparison Workshop for
carbon, germanium, and gold plasmas.

1 Introduction

Spectroscopy of plasmas has a wide range of applications (1; 2), including the
study of astrophysical objects, diagnostics of laser produced plasmas, and anal-
ysis of radiation emission from plumes of rockets. In spite of the importance
of this subject and the substantial eﬀorts made by numerous groups, there
persist signiﬁcant discrepancies in results of the plasma kinetic codes used to
analyze plasma emission spectra under non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium
(NLTE) conditions. For examples of the level of disagreement see, e.g., the
reports from the NLTE Code Comparison Workshops (3; 4; 5).

Given the plasma particle temperature and density, the ﬁrst task of kinetic
codes is the computation of the charge state and excitation state distributions
(1; 2). These are typically determined from the set of rate equations:

where Nζm is the density of ions having charge ζ ( 0
Z with Z being the
nuclear charge) excited to state m (ordered according to their ascending en-
ergy, m = 0 corresponds to the ion’s ground state), ne is the electron density,
and Ra→b denotes the rate coeﬃcient (r-c) for the transition of an ion from
state a to state b due to some atomic process. In Eq. (1), k represents the
number of electrons taking part in any given process, thus, k = 0 for sponta-
neous decay and autoionization, k = 1 for the electron impact processes (e.g.,
excitation and photorecombination), and k = 2 for the three-body recombina-
tion. In large-size plasmas, where linear dimension is larger than the photon
mean free path, photon induced processes must also be included in (1). In a
steady state plasma, d Nζm/dt = 0, and Eq. (1) reduces to:

This is a ﬁnite set of non-linear coupled equations for Nζm ’s. If one is interested
only in the density of the charge states, regardless of the ionic excitations, Eq.
(2) can be further simpliﬁed, and the result is a set of recursive equations:

Pm Nζm is the density of the charge state, and Iζ→ζ+1, R(2)
Here Nζ =
ζ+1→ζ
and R(3)
ζ+1→ζ are the total rate coeﬃcients for ionization, two-body (radia-
tive+dielectronic) recombination, and three-body recombination, respectively.
For quasineutral plasmas, solutions of Eq.(3) have to satisfy two complemen-
tary conditions, namely,

ni =

Nζ ; ne =

ζ Nζ = Z ni.

Here ni is the total ion density, and Z is the average charge of the ions. In
the following we assume that Nζ is the fractional abundance of charge state
ζ, which is equivalent to the assumption that ni = 1.

The disagreement between the results of the kinetic codes developed by various
researchers may originate from several factors. One of the most important is
the approximate character of the r-c’s. In the literature one can ﬁnd several

2

recommended formulas for the relevant r-c’s. Some may be more accurate than
others, but none was shown to have high accuracy. For higher accuracy, the r-
c’s can be directly calculated for each transition between atomic states, using
advanced quantum-mechanical methods. The necessity to generate a large
number of r-c’s for kinetic calculations, however, impedes the application of
these techniques, thereby forcing a compromise between computational speed
and accuracy. The solutions of (3) obviously depend on the methods chosen
for the determination of the r-c’s in the right-hand side of (3).

Another source of disagreement is the criterion used for the continuum or
ionization potential lowering in plasmas. This is particularly important in
high-density plasmas where the plasma potential moves the upper ionic bound
states into the continuum, leaving the ion only with a ﬁnite number of discrete
states. Moreover, due to the ﬂuctuations of the local microﬁeld around each
ion, even the ”tightly bound states” may change into instantaneous quasi-
molecular states whose treatment is, as yet, not clear.

Comparison of the results of NLTE kinetic codes was a subject of several
workshops (3; 4; 5). The participants were asked to submit large sets of various
physical quantities to be compared, and in numerous cases very signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were found. This situation is well exempliﬁed in Fig. 1, where the
various calculations of the relative ion populations for a germanium plasma
are presented for a speciﬁc case from the NLTE-3 Workshop (5). One can
clearly notice a signiﬁcant spread both for the mean ion charges and for the
distribution widths calculated with diﬀerent kinetic codes. Although a variety
of physical parameters investigated at the Workshop was mostly suﬃcient
to draw conclusions about sources of discrepancies, introduction of simple
and clearly deﬁned new parameters that would pinpoint some fundamental
underlying diﬀerences would greatly facilitate such comparisons.

In Ref. (7) one of the authors developed a method that allows determination of
variations in an ionization state distribution due to small changes in the rates
of basic atomic processes. The purpose of the present paper is the opposite,
that is, to introduce new parameters that quantify diﬀerences in the input
atomic rates in kinetic codes using the results of calculations. Such approach
is similar to solution of the inverse problem in physics.

Below we address a simple but critical question, namely: “How diﬀerent are
two population kinetic codes?” It is obvious that the most comprehensive an-
swer can be obtained provided all input and output parameters as well as the
complete description of the approximations used are available. Unfortunately,
this is not always the case. Here we introduce parameters that are straightfor-
ward to calculate and can provide an answer in a clear manner. An important
feature of the proposed method is that only the most general kinetic charac-
teristics, such as the mean ion charge and central momenta, are required to

determine these new parameters.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we deﬁne these pa-
rameters and explain their meanings. In Section 3 we apply the method to
characterize the diﬀerences between code results for three representative cases
from the NLTE-3 Workshop (5). Finally, in Section 4, a short summary and
conclusions are presented.

2 Quantitative characterization of kinetic codes

We introduce the notation Qζ for the r.h.s. of Eq. (3):

Qζ =

Iζ→ζ+1
ζ+1→ζ + neR(3)

R(2)

ζ+1→ζ

(5)

and denote by ∆Qζ
Q the overall diﬀerence in this quantity for a
given code relative to the reference. Using this deﬁnition, Eq.(3) is rewritten

Qref

≡

−

4

as:

Nζ+1
Nζ

= Qζ.

It was shown in Ref. (7), that the relative diﬀerence in the ﬁnal results,
∆Nζ/Nζ, caused by the relative diﬀerences used in the input data, ∆Qζ/Qζ,
is given by

∆Nζ
Nζ

In particular, if the relative diﬀerences are all equal, then

and Eq.(7) reduces to the simple form (7):

p = const,

≡

∆Nζ
Nζ

= p(ζ

Z).

In Ref. (7) a full discussion is presented about the meaning of Eq. (10), as well
as how and when this diﬀerence inﬂuences the results of kinetic codes. Even if
∆Qζ/Qζ is not constant, one can deﬁne their average value, p
iζ,

∆Qζ/Qζ

≡ h

over the relevant ion charge states.

The above formulas were derived assuming small diﬀerences between code
results. In a general case, however, the deviations are not small, and one has
to symmetrize the relevant parameters with respect to both compared codes,
i.e.:

Nζ =

(N1,ζ + N2,ζ), Z =

(Z 1 + Z 2),

and so on, which is assumed in what follows.

where σ2 is the variance, or second central moment, which is related to the
ionization distribution width. Remarkably, this equation links the average dif-
ference in the ratios of eﬀective atomic rates to the most general plasma pa-
rameters, namely, mean ion charges and variances.

However, if two compared codes have the same Z but diﬀerent variances, the
parameter p deﬁned by Eq. (12) is zero. This simply means that the approx-
imation (9) is insensitive to diﬀerences in ionization distribution widths. To
take this dependence into account, one can add the next term in the expansion
with respect to (ζ

Z):

To derive equations relating two parameters, p and k, we multiply Eq. (14)

Equation (15) is the main result of the present paper. We propose to use
the parameters p and k for characterization of diﬀerences between plasma
kinetic codes. Using Eq. (15), which depends only on the most general kinetic
parameters, namely, mean ion charges and central momenta, one can directly
evaluate the average diﬀerences between the eﬀective rates implemented in
various kinetic codes.

3 Comparison of kinetic codes

The above described method is applied here to the computational results from
the 3rd NLTE Workshop (5) that can be accessed in the NIST SAHA database
(6). This database contains various parameters, including mean ion charges,
central momenta, and ion populations, which may be used to determine the
quantities p and k deﬁned in Eqs. (12) and (15). The SAHA database also
provides other valuable parameters, such as eﬀective rates and partition func-
tions, so that a user can obtain a deep insight into diﬀerences between kinetic
codes. In accordance with the policy accepted by the Workshop participants,
the results will be presented without direct attribution, although a list of par-
ticipating codes will be given for each case. Note also that not all codes provide
a complete set of central momenta up to σ4.

The ﬁrst step of the comparison procedure consists in selection of a reference
against which the other codes are to be compared. In the following comparisons
the reference code is chosen arbitrarily, as generally there are no a priori
physical grounds to prefer a particular code. Obviously, the average values of
p and k would change when selecting another code as a reference. However,
the standard deviations σ of the corresponding distributions of p and k that
reﬂect the average spread within a group of codes should not change and
therefore are reported below as well. In what follows, the parameters p and
k determined from Eqs. (12) and (15) are referred to as “calculated”, while
those determined by ﬁtting the ∆Q/Q ratios (Eqs. 9 and 13) are referred to
as “ﬁt”. As the ﬁtting procedure has to include only the physically signiﬁcant
cases, ion states with Nζ < 10−4 were excluded from the comparison. Also,
in order to emphasize the contribution from the most populated states, the
ﬁtting was performed with the weights gw = √N1N2, where N1 and N2 are
the ion populations of the reference and compared codes.

Among numerous cases available in the SAHA database we selected three
cases for germanium, carbon, and gold. These elements cover a wide range
of ion charges and their ions represent atomic systems with diﬀerent level of
complexity.

3.1 Ge

For germanium, we selected a relatively simple case of Te = 600 eV and
Ne = 1017 cm−3, where almost all codes have a mean ion charge Z
22
corresponding to a closed-shell Ne-like Ge. This case will be discussed in more
detail than the C and Au cases.

and k. The values of p determined from the single-parameter formula (12) or
ﬁt using Eq. (9) have subscript “0”. One can immediately notice a generally
good agreement between the calculated and ﬁt values of p for all but one code.
Table 1 clearly demonstrates that code 7 is an outlier, which is also emphasized
by its very diﬀerent value of the mean ion charge Z
27. Moreover, the two-
parameter ﬁt was not performed for code 7, as for only one ion stage both
code 7 and the reference code have populations larger than 10−4.

≈

Another interesting feature is a very small diﬀerence between the “simple” p of
Eq. (9) and calculated and ﬁt values of p determined from the two-parameter
formulas. While agreement between diﬀerently calculated parameters p is gen-
erally very good, the calculated and ﬁt values of k show worse level of corre-
spondence. This is not surprising since k is a high-order parameter which may
be more sensitive to small variations in data.

As already mentioned, a standard deviation σ would unambiguously represent
the spread of parameters p and k within a particular group of codes. The last
row in Table 1 show σ’s calculated for each column (the outlier code 7 was
not included in the determination of σ). Remarkably, σ’s for calculated p0 and
two-parameter calculated and ﬁt p’s agree within only 6 %, and even σ(pf
0 )
deviates by less than 25 %. The value of σ
0.3 means that in this group of
codes the average deviation of eﬀective ionization and recombination rates is
about 30 %.

≈

Finally, consider the dependence of σ on electron temperature Te. The SAHA
database contains data for Te = 150 eV, 250 eV, 450 eV, and 600 eV at ne

= 1017 cm−3. The calculated σ’s for p0, p, and k are presented in Fig. 2 for
the four temperatures. At low Te, the mostly populated ions are those with
open shells, and since these cases are most diﬃcult to calculate, the diﬀerence
between codes is the largest. With the increase of electron temperature, the
ionization stage approaches the closed-shell Ne-like ion, and therefore agree-
ment improves dramatically. Note also that σk is smaller than σp, and therefore
in many cases a simple one-parameter formula for p would be suﬃcient for es-
timates of the diﬀerence between codes.

Carbon cases in the SAHA database were calculated at a single electron den-
sity of Ne = 1022 cm−3. At Te = 20 eV, which is the selected case here, the
mean ion charge varies between 1.8 to 3.3 for diﬀerent codes. There are no
obvious outliers in this case, and therefore two-parameter ﬁts were successful
for all codes (Table 2). Similar to the Ge case, the correlation between cal-
culated and ﬁt values is generally good, although one-parameter p’s for codes
8 and 9 show larger discrepancies. The standard deviations for the diﬀerent
parameters p in Table 2 agree even better than for the Ge case, however, they
are about a factor of 2 larger and reach 60 %. This would seem to be un-

expected as carbon simulations could include only seven ionization stages at
most and are thus supposed to be simpler. The reason for the larger σ’s is that
the eﬀects of ionization potential lowering are much more important here due
to the signiﬁcantly higher density, and diﬀerent treatments of the continuum
lowering noticeably contribute to the increased spread of the p and, to a lesser
extent, k values.

3.3 Au

The gold cases available in the SAHA database show very signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences, and for the selected case of Ne = 1021 cm−3 and Te = 750 eV, the
mean ion charge varies between 31 (code 7) and 44 (code 4). Moreover, ioniza-
tion distributions for codes 1 and 2 show double peak structure unlike other,
smoother bell-like distributions. It is therefore not surprising that the absolute
values of p, which are the main indicators of code disagreements, are much
larger than for the Ge and C cases discussed above. As a consequence, the
standard deviations for the diﬀerently determined p and k values do not show
the same level of agreement as previously. This situation simply reﬂects very
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between code results submitted to the 3rd NLTE Code
Comparison Workshop.

4 Conclusions

As the complexity of plasma kinetic codes rapidly increases, their veriﬁcation
and validation is becoming mandatory for establishing credibility of compu-
tational results. To this end, a development of new techniques for code com-
parisons is an urgent and important task. In the present paper we introduced
two new parameters for the characterization of discrepancies between plasma
kinetic codes. These parameters describe diﬀerences between eﬀective ioniza-
tion and recombination rates used in the codes. Importantly, the only physical
quantities required for their calculation are the mean ion charges and central
momenta that are the most widely reported characteristics of plasma kinetic
calculations. Since the ﬁnal formulas include only the simplest algebra, this
method provides very fast estimates of code diﬀerences in the input atomic
rates. The new parametrization was applied to the data from the 3rd NLTE
Code Comparison Workshop and the presented results clearly prove simplicity
and reliability of the method used. We plan to implement this method to the
analysis of the data from future NLTE workshops.

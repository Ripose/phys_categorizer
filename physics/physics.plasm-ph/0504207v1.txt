Abstract

A heuristic model is given for anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence in the

presence of a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld B0 ˆek. The model is valid for both moderate and

strong B0 and is able to describe both the strong and weak wave turbulence regimes as well as the

transition between them. The main ingredient of our model is the assumption of constant ratio at

all scales between linear wave periods and nonlinear turnover timescales. Contrary to the model

of critical balance introduced by Goldreich and Sridhar (1995), we do not assume in addition that

this ratio be equal to unity at all scales. We are then able to show that one recovers the widely
observed anisotropic scaling law kk ∝ k2/3

⊥ between parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers (with

reference to B0 ˆek). This generalization allows one to use the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan phenomenology

to describe anisotropic MHD turbulence for which we ﬁnd the universal prediction, 3α+2β = 7, for

the total energy spectrum E(k⊥, kk) ∼ k−α

⊥ k−β

k . In particular, with such a prediction we recover

the weak Alfv´en wave turbulence constant-ﬂux solution and give for the ﬁrst time a possible

explanation to its precursor found numerically by Galtier et al. (2000).

INTRODUCTION

Turbulence ﬂows are often studied under the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy

[1, 2]. Such assumptions are convenient for theoretical studies but are not always justiﬁed

physically. For example, it is well known that stratiﬁcation or rotation applied to neutral

ﬂows lead to anisotropic turbulence (see e.g. [3, 4]).

Isotropy is even more diﬃcult to

justify in astrophysics where a magnetic ﬁeld is almost always present at the largest scale

of the system. The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation has proved to be quite

successful in the study of a variety of space plasmas. During the last quarter of century many

studies have been devoted to incompressible MHD turbulence in the presence of a uniform

external magnetic ﬁeld B0 ˆek [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. One of the

most clearly established results is that the presence of B0 leads to a bi-dimensionalization

of an initial isotropic energy spectrum: the turbulent cascade transfers energy preferentially

to perpendicular wavenumbers, i.e. in the direction transverse to B0 ˆek.

Constant-ﬂux spectra are known to occur in many instances in turbulent ﬂows, the best
example of which being the Kolmogorov energy spectrum following a E(k) ∝ k−5/3 law

for three-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence [20]. Power law spectra are also measured

in turbulent MHD ﬂows but the value of the scaling index is still hardly discussed in the

community. The ﬁrst prediction in MHD was given independently by Iroshnikov and Kraich-

nan [21, 22] (hereafter IK). They argued that the destruction of phase coherence by Alfv´en

waves traveling in opposite directions along the local large scale magnetic ﬁeld introduces

a new timescale and a slowing down of energy transfer to small scales. Assuming isotropy,
the dimensional analysis for three wave interactions leads to a E(k) ∝ k−3/2 spectrum for

the total energy (see also [23]). Many direct numerical simulations of strong turbulence in

isotropic (B0 = 0) MHD have been made during the last years (see e.g. [15, 17, 24]) but a

deﬁnitive conclusion about the spectrum index is still not achieved mainly because the Kol-

mogorov and IK predictions are very close; furthermore, such scaling laws may be slightly

altered by intermittency eﬀects, and the numerical resolution is barely suﬃcient to deter-

mine such spectral indices. Goldreich and Shridar proposed in 1995 [11] a heuristic model

of strong turbulence for anisotropic (moderate B0) MHD where the distinction between the

perpendicular (k⊥) and parallel (kk) wavenumbers is made. This model is based on a critical

balance between linear wave periods τA and nonlinear turnover timescales τN L for which the

2

equality τA = τN L is assumed to hold at all scales in the inertial range. (Only the symmetric

case, for which the Alfv´en waves traveling in opposite directions carry equal energy ﬂuxes,

is considered here and in the remainder of the paper.) Then the one dimensional perpendic-
ular power spectrum for the total energy scales as E(k⊥) ∝ k−5/3
whereas the parallel and
perpendicular spatial sizes of eddies are correlated according to the scaling law kk ∝ k2/3
⊥ .
The latter prediction is rather new (see however [25]) and seems well observed in recent

⊥

direct numerical simulations for moderate B0 [15, 17].

As is well known, in the limit of large B0 MHD turbulence becomes weak and strongly

anisotropic. The formalism of weak Alfv´en wave turbulence developed by Galtier et al.

[16, 19] is well adapted to this situation. It leads to the so–called wave kinetic equations
for which the exact power law solution for the total energy is E(k⊥, kk) ∝ k−2

⊥ f (kk). The
function f (kk) is undetermined because of the dynamical decoupling of parallel planes in

Fourier space (this is the signature of the absence of energy transfer along the B0 direction;

it thus represents a shadow of the initial conditions). Numerical simulations of the wave

kinetic equations show clearly such a constant-ﬂux spectrum but it also reveals the existence

of a transient spectrum during the front propagation towards small scales with a steeper
power–law in k−7/3

, the dynamics of which is not yet clariﬁed [26, 27]. The discovery of such

⊥

transient spectra in wave turbulence and the possible existence of a family of solutions that

are not caught by the usual technique of conformal transform [28] constitute a new exciting

topic of research where some progress is currently being made [29, 30]. When using a shell

model of strong turbulence, it has also been found [31] that, when considering the decay of

energy in time as a power law, initial transients occur that also follow power–laws to leading

order and that precede the ﬁnal power–law decay of the energy; the origin of such transients

in time may well be a transient in the Fourier energy spectrum preceding the establishment

of a Kolmogorov–like spectrum, although this point has not been documented yet.

In this paper, we propose a heuristic model that describes anisotropic MHD ﬂows for

the regimes of strong (moderate B0) and weak wave (strong B0) turbulence as well as the

transition between them. As a result of our analysis, a family of solutions is found for

the anisotropic total energy spectrum from which the transient spectrum described above

is a particular solution. We show that the model supports the same anisotropic scaling

law between the parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers as the one found in the context

3

of critical balance but it is more general in the sense that here we do not impose equality

between linear wave periods and nonlinear turnover timescales. We ﬁnally propose to extend

the anisotropic model to two other types of ﬂuids.

II. ANISOTROPIC MHD MODEL

We focus our attention to the case where nonlinearities are only mediated by interactions

among shear-Alfv´en waves, disregarding pseudo-Alfv´en waves which are known to be slaved

to the former (see e.g. [16]), an assumption also followed in [11]. As stated above, the

presence of the mean magnetic ﬁeld B0 leads to anisotropy and thus to diﬀerent variations

with wavenumber directions, leading us to distinguish between k⊥ and kk. More precisely
we will assume that k⊥ ≫ kk, i.e. that under the external agent (here, B0), the turbulent

ﬂow develops principally in the direction perpendicular to this agent. We will consider the

symmetric case for which, in particular, the r.m.s. value of the ﬂuctuating velocity ﬁeld v

and magnetic ﬁeld b have the same order of magnitude; note that b is taken in velocity

units since we are restricting the analysis to the incompressible case (the density is constant

and can be assumed to be equal to unity).

In the classical Kolmogorov phenomenology (hereafter, K41), the ﬂuctuations are dis-

tributed isotropically and there is only one timescale, the nonlinear time or eddy turnover

time τN L, which is also the transfer time of the energy to small scales within the system, i.e.
τtr = τN L. The rate of energy transfer per unit mass writes EK41 ∼ E/τtr, where E is the total

energy. In the very same spirit, we can develop the IK phenomenology for anisotropic MHD
turbulence using explicitly the fact that the eddy turnover time is τN L ∼ (vk)−1 ∼ (vk⊥)−1
and the Alfv´en wave period is τA ∼ 1/(kkB0). We assume that these two timescales are not

equal which allows us to use the IK phenomenology. The rate of energy transfer per unit

mass now writes

where the transfer time will be assumed to scale as

(1)

(2)

as is known to be the case for three-wave interaction processes [16, 21, 22]. The subscript

“a” in IKa stands for the anisotropic version of IK. Including relation (2) into (1), one

where α and β are unknown.

It is a 2D energy spectrum.

In other words, the to-

tal energy is recovered by directly integrating the spectrum along k⊥ and kk, i.e. E =

R R E(k⊥, kk) dk⊥dkk (see e.g. [16], for a rigorous deﬁnition). We note at this stage a diﬀer-

ence with the classical phenomenology where the energy spectrum is not introduced with

an unknown index but rather deduced by the analysis. We introduce relation (4) into (3),
and by noticing that v2 ∼ E ∼ E(k⊥, kk) k⊥kk, we obtain:

which can also be rewritten in terms of a (k⊥, kk) relationship as:

This is our ﬁrst anisotropic relation.

In order to proceed further, we are now seeking a

second relationship between the two scaling indices α and β. One way to obtain a unique

relation between them is to use the assumption of constant ratio between τN L and τA at all

scales. In other words, we will assume that

is a constant at all scales but not necessarily equal to one as it is in the critical balance

model [11]. A ratio of one seems to be very restrictive and does not correspond to some of

the results stemming from direct numerical simulations where χ can be smaller than unity,

as observed for example in [32], a two-dimensional geometrical case where local anisotropy

is possible, or in solar wind in situ measurements [33] where χ seems to be smaller than

unity. It is also in apparent contradiction with wave turbulence theory for which we have
χ ≪ 1. We will see that the assumption of constant ratio is suﬃcient to achieve a uniﬁed

model that describes both strong and weak MHD turbulence. With the deﬁnition of the

timescales given above, we obtain

χ =

(9)

This leads us to the ﬁrst main conclusion of this paper: the same scaling in wavenumbers

as the critical balance model [11] is obtained when χ is not equal to unity, i.e. when the

IK phenomenology is used.

It thus seems to be a general law for incompressible MHD

turbulence, when either the Kolmogorov phenomenology for energy transfer or the IKa

three-wave formulation of energy transfer is utilized, as long as a critical balance (generalized

to any ratio diﬀering from unity) is assumed between stretching by velocity gradients and

wave motions in the presence of a uniform ﬁeld B0. Note that starting with relationship

(9) and assuming χ = 1 would of course yield the same 2/3 scaling between parallel and

perpendicular wavenumbers derived in [11].

Another important and somewhat unexpected consequence of this analysis has to deal

with the scaling of the energy spectrum.

In the context of critical balance, it is claimed

that the energy spectrum derived with an anisotropic Kolmogorov phenomenology scales
like E(k⊥) ∼ k−5/3

. Here we show that it is in fact possible to ﬁnd a multitude of spectral

⊥

indices α and β that satisfy the assumption of constant ratio χ at all scales in the inertial

range. Such indices follow in fact a general linear relationship. To ﬁnd this relation we need

to equalize the power-law behaviors found in relations (6) and (9) between the parallel and

perpendicular distribution of modal energy in Fourier space. If we use explicitly the fact

that the rates of energy transfer per unit mass do not depend on the scale [20, 21, 22], we

ﬁnally obtain

3α + 2β = 7 .

(10)

Relationship (10) is general and can be used for strong turbulence, for which χ ∼ 1, as well
as for weak wave turbulence, where χ ≪ 1. Note that the relationship (10) is compatible with

the anisotropic Kolmogorov spectrum (with α = 5/3 and β = 1) as advocated by Goldreich

and Sridhar [11], and with the anisotropic IK-like spectrum corresponding to three-wave

interactions for weak MHD turbulence (α = 2 and β = 1/2) [16, 34, 35]. We conjecture that

it is compatible as well with the physics of the transitional regime between weak and strong

MHD turbulence. In other words the law (10) we just derived shows that the 2/3 scaling

between a dependence of k⊥ and kk is not a unique signature of the Kolmogorov spectrum

6

but rather a signature of the rate at which energy is transfered to small scales where it is

dissipated, i.e. a trace of the decay of energy, and as such an unavoidable dimensional law.

III. DISCUSSION

The preceding remark may be linked to the heretofore unexplained following ﬁnding:

using direct numerical simulations in two space dimensions, it was shown in [36] that the

structure functions of order p based on the energy ﬂux to small scales (as expressed in terms

of the exact laws for MHD turbulence derived in [37, 38]) have a self–similar scaling in the

inertial range which is compatible with the scaling for the velocity structure functions in ﬂuid

turbulence, whereas the structure functions of the basic ﬁelds (velocity and magnetic ﬁelds)

are more intermittent insofar as they depart more signiﬁcantly from a linear scaling with p.

What this paper shows is that both models (K41 and IK) can be seen in a unifying way,

illustrated by the law (10). Note that in the case of the advection of a passive tracer such

as temperature, it also seems that the scaling of the structure functions based on the ﬂux of

the tracer is close to the ﬂuid scaling laws [39, 40], whereas the tracer itself is well–known

to be strongly intermittent.

More surprisingly perhaps, the choice of α = 7/3 and β = 0 also satisﬁes the law (10)

derived in this paper. This k−7/3

⊥

spectrum was found in [16] as a precursor to the constant

ﬂux solution of the Alfv´en wave kinetic equations which establishes itself later in time;

indeed, in that paper, the 7/3 spectrum is found numerically for the case kk = 0, i.e.

without any dependence in kk (corresponding to β = 0). The simple model proposed here

thus sheds some light, albeit heuristically, on two intriguing facts that have emerged recently

concerning weak wave turbulence: (i) the fact that, preceding in time the constant ﬂux

solution, a power-law spectrum (called the precursor) establishes itself the origin of which

was unrelated to anything known about turbulence spectra [16, 29] until now, and (ii) the

fact that in some cases (see e.g. Ref. [30]) in the weak wave turbulence regime, a wealth of

power-law solutions in the (α, β) plane can be found numerically as stationary solutions to

the wave kinetic equations, although it is not clear whether such solutions are attractive, nor

whether they are stable. The link between the dimensional argument given here which allows

to recover the α = 7/3 precursor spectrum, and the self-similar argument given in [16], which

is compatible with the α = 7/3 spectrum, remains to be clariﬁed. Indeed, in [16] one recovers

7

the numerically observed law of self-similar decay of the energy spectrum, assuming that
the energy spectrum scales in the precursor phase as k−7/3
, whereas in this paper we give a
heuristic justiﬁcation to that same −7/3 law in terms of dimensional arguments compatible

⊥

with three-wave interactions and with the assumption that there is no kk dependency in

the precursor solution. We show furthermore that this law stems from the same type of

uniﬁed approach that also gives the other known spectra for MHD turbulence.

In order

to ascertain the validity of the model derived here, numerical computations with the full

three–dimensional MHD equations can be envisaged but being able to distinguish between

diﬀerent power laws which are close in their respective spectral indices may prove diﬃcult.

This point is currently investigated and will be presented elsewhere.

The argumentation delineated here could be used for other types of wave turbulence,

like in the case of whistler waves [41], inertial waves [4] or gravity waves [42]. For whistler

waves that can be encountered in Hall MHD or electron MHD, the characteristic wave
period scales as τW ∼ [k⊥kk]−1 (see e.g. [43]). One ﬁnds, following the same analysis as
presented before in this paper, that kk ∼ k1/3

⊥ (see also [44]); hence, the prediction for
scaling exponents as deﬁned in equation (4) for the whistler turbulence energy spectrum

ﬁeld, i.e. τN L = [v k⊥]−1 = [b k2

becomes: 3α + β = 8. (Note that here, the eddy turnover time is based on the magnetic
⊥]−1, since v ∝ ∇ × b.) The known constant–ﬂux solution,
α = 5/2 and β = 1/2, to the wave kinetic equations derived in Ref. [41] is recovered again

as well as the strong turbulence prediction, α = 7/3 and β = 1 [45].

When considering inertial waves in rotating turbulence for a Navier-Stokes ﬂuid, the wave
period scales as τI ∼ k⊥/kk. The same analysis as before leads to the following relationship

between scaling exponents: 3α + 5β = 10. The known constant–ﬂux solution to the wave

kinetic equations written in Ref.

[4] for wave turbulence corresponds to α = 5/2 and

β = 1/2, which does fulﬁll the above relationship and we recover the Kolmogorov prediction

for strong turbulence as well, viz. α = 5/3 and β = 1 for a weak rotation rate [46].

This prediction again could be tested using direct numerical simulations, and the possible

existence of precursors could also be studied and checked against the compatibility with the

above relationship between the scaling exponents α and β in the rotating case.

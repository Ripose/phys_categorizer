Analysis of low pressure electro-positive and
electro-negative rf plasmas with Monte Carlo
method

M. Ardehali 1

Silicon Systems Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation,
Sagamihara, Kanagawa 229 Japan

Abstract

Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo technique is used to simulate low pressure
electro-negative and electro-positive plasmas at a frequency of 10 MHz.
The potential, electric ﬁeld, electron and ion density, and currents ﬂowing
across the plasma are presented. To compare the physical properties of
the electro-positive gas with those of an electro-negative gas, the input
voltage was decreased from 1000 Volts to 350 Volts. The simulation results
indicate that the introduction of negative ions induces dramatic eﬀects
on the spatial and temporal variation of the electric ﬁeld and on the
behavior of the electron, ion, and displacement currents. In particular, the
numerical modeling predicts the formation of double-layer at the plasma-
sheath boundary of electro-negative discharge.

I. Introduction

Plasma-assisted processing is becoming increasingly important in microelec-
tronics industry [1]. The ﬁgures-of-merit of the process (for example anisotropy,
etching rate, etc.) are strongly inﬂuenced by the discharge properties, such as
plasma density, plasma potential, etc [2], [3]. Obviously predictive models are
needed to analyze the rf glow discharges [4]. Unfortunately, plasma discharges
are complex systems that are very diﬃcult to analyze. In recent years, there has
been considerable eﬀorts to model these systems self-consistently. Particle-in-
cell/Monte-Carlo (PIC/MC) simulation has proven to be an eﬀective and power-
ful tool in increasing the general understanding of plasma processing. PIC/MC
simulation is very attractive because it has the advantage of being self-consistent
and does not require any assumptions regarding the internal electric ﬁeld, the
electron velocity distribution function, and the relaxation time approximation
[5].

The purpose of the present paper is to compare the physical properties of an
electro-positive gas with those of an electro-negative gas at comparable plasma
densities. The simulation results indicate that the introduction of negative ions
in rf plasma induces dramatic eﬀects on the electric ﬁeld distribution within the
discharge and leads to the double-layer formation.

II. Details of simulation

We have developed a PIC/MC simulator to model electro-positive and electro-
negative discharges. Monte Carlo technique is considerably more accurate than
ﬂuid dynamics method because it accounts for the non-local eﬀects naturally;
whereas ﬂuid dynamics accounts for the non-local eﬀects on an ad hoc basis.

Very brieﬂy, the present PIC/MC simulator consists of the following steps:
(1) The instantaneous locations of MC particles representing ions and electrons
are interpolated to the grid points to obtain the charge density.
(2) Poisson’s equation on a spatially discretized mesh is solved to obtain the
electric ﬁeld.
(3) The electric ﬁeld is interpolated from the grid points to the location of MC
particles.
(4) The equations of motion under the local and instantaneous electric ﬁeld are
integrated.
(5) Random numbers (Monte Carlos technique) and collision cross sections are
used to determine the probability that each particle suﬀers a collision.

As an example of the application of this simulator, we have modeled an rf
plasma at a pressure of 20 mTorr. Since in this work we are primarily interested
in comparing the physical properties of the electro-positive and electro-negative
gases, we have intentionally kept the plasma model simple. In the simulation,
the applied frequency is ω
2π = 10 MHz, and the discharge length is 20 cm with
perfectly absorbing electrodes. The time step δt = 0.1 ns which is small enough

2

to resolve the electron plasma frequency. For the electro-positive plasma, an
Argon type discharge was considered. The left electrode of the discharge is
driven with a voltage Vrf (t) = Vrf sinωt, where Vrf = 1000 Volts. The electron-
neutral ionization cross section σ(v) is given by σ(v) = k
v , where v is the electron
velocity and the rate constant k is 2 × 10−8 cm3/s. Ionizing collisions occur
if the electron energy is larger than 15 eV. An ionizing collision is modeled by
loading a new electron and ion at the position of the ionizing electron. The
kinetic energy after ionizing collision is partitioned between the two electrons
with equal probability.

For the electro-negative discharge, a Chlorine gas was considered. The left
electrode of the discharge is driven with a voltage Vrf (t) = Vrf sinωt, where
Vrf = 350 Volts. The ionization cross section is the same as for the electro-
positive gas. The additional processes considered are dissociative electron at-
tachment leading to negative ion formation and positive ion/negative ion recom-
bination. The scattering and ionization processes are represented as follows:

−

Cl2 + e → Cl
Cl2 + e → Cl+
2 + Cl

+ Cl
2 + 2e
− → Cl2 + Cl

Cl+

(1)

2 and Cl− are the main positive and negative ions, respectively. The
where Cl+
rate constants for attachment and recombination are 1.8 × 10−10 cm3/s and
5 × 10−8 cm3/s respectively [6]. In the electro-negative discharge, the electron
density is an order of magnitude smaller than the positive (or negative) ion
density; in the simulation, however, the electron weight was adjusted to make
the number of MC particles corresponding to electrons similar to the number
of MC particles corresponding to positive and negative ions.

III. Electro-positive discharge

We ﬁrst present the simulation results for an electro-positive discharge at a
pressure of 20 mTorr. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the potential and the electric
ﬁeld at four times during the rf cycle. In the bulk, the potential is constant,
and hence the electric ﬁeld is negligible. In the sheath, however, the potential
changes rapidly (due to accumulation of positive charge in the space charge
region), and the electric ﬁeld therefore becomes very large, especially near the
electrodes. This is particularly evident at ωt
2π = 0.75. Figures
2(a) and 2(b) show the ion and electron density of the electro-positive plasma.
The ion density is independent of the phase of the applied voltage, whereas
the electron density oscillates within the sheath. The large electric ﬁeld at the
sheath pushes the electrons away from the sheath, whereas it accelerates some
of the positive ions toward the electrodes.

2π = 0.25 and ωt

Figures 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), and 3(d) show the spatial and temporal variations
of the electron current, displacement current, ion current, and total current at

3

2π = 0 and ωt

four times during the cycle respectively (the units are not relative and represent
true values). At ωt
2π = 0.5, the sheath current is predominantly dis-
placement current, whereas at ωt
2π = 0.25 and ( ωt
2π = 0.75) the electron current
is the dominant current in the sheath of the powered (grounded) electrode. The
electron current, however, is dominant in the bulk at all times during the cycle.
Since the bulk electric ﬁeld does not change with time, the displacement current
has a negligible value in the bulk. Also note that the bulk ion current (Fig. 3
(c)) does not modulate with time, but at the sheath boundary, the ion current
increases abruptly due to the large sheath electric ﬁeld and oscillates with time.
The total current, which is deﬁned as the sum of the electron, displacement and
ion current (Fig. 3 (d)), is constant across the discharge.

IV. Electro-negative discharge

To obtain an electro-negative discharge with plasma density comparable to
that of the electro-positive discharge, the applied voltage was decreased from
1000 Volts to 350 Volts. Figure 4(a) shows the potential at four times during
the rf cycle. The potential changes signiﬁcantly near the electrodes, leading
to large electric ﬁelds within the sheaths. However unlike the electro-positive
plasma, the potential in the bulk is not constant. Figure 4(b) shows the electric
ﬁeld proﬁle at four times during the cycle. Since negative ions and electrons are
excluded from the sheath, the space charge within the sheath is positive. Note
that at times ωt
2π = 0.75 the electric ﬁeld becomes very large
near the electrodes.

2π = 0.25 and ωt

Comparing Figs. 1 (b) and 4 (b), three important diﬀerences between the

electro-positive and electro-negative discharges may be noted:
(1) Unlike the electro-positive discharge, the electric ﬁeld has a nonvanishing
value in the bulk of the electro-negative discharge.
(2) In electro-negative discharge, the electric ﬁeld shows a relative maximum at
the plasma-sheath boundary. The maximum is due to double-layer formations
and is particularly important at ωt
2π = 0 and ωt
2π = 0.5. This result is in agree-
ment with experimental measurements [7].
(3) The magnitude of the sheath electric ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly larger in the electro-
positive discharge than in the electro-negative plasma.
These factors have profound inﬂuence on the behavior of the spatial and tem-
poral variations of the electron, ion, and displacement currents within the dis-
charge.

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the positive and negative ion density within the
discharge. The ion density is independent of the phase of the applied volt-
age. The large electric ﬁeld at the sheath pushes the negative ions away from
the sheath and hence negative ions are completely excluded from the sheath.
However, some of the positive ions are accelerated by the sheath toward the
electrodes. It should be noted that in the bulk, negative ions are lost due to

4

recombination and hence do not accumulate at the boundary of the sheath and
the glow region. Figure 5(c) shows the electron density at four times during
the cycle. Unlike the ions, the electron density is a function of time and varies
signiﬁcantly within the sheath. When the sheath electric ﬁeld at the left elec-
trode is small, electrons move toward the left electrode but are excluded from
the right electrode. On the other hand when the sheath electric ﬁeld at the right
electrode is small, electrons move toward the right electrode but are excluded
from the left electrode. The modulation of the bulk electron density, however,
is small and almost negligible. Fig. 5(d) compares the electron, positive ion and
negative ion a density at four times during the cycle. Note that in the bulk, the
sum of the electron density and negative ion density is approximately equal to
the positive ion density and hence total charge within the bulk is almost zero.
Figures 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), 6(d), and 6(e) show the spatial and temporal varia-
tions of the electron current, displacement current, positive ion current, negative
ion current, and total current at four times during the cycle respectively (again,
the units are not relative and represent true values). Similar to the electro-
2π = 0 and ωt
positive discharge, at ωt
2π = 0.5 the sheath current is predominantly
2π = 0.25 ( ωt
displacement current, whereas at ωt
2π = 0.75) the electron current is
the dominant current in the sheath of the powered (grounded) electrode. The
electron current is dominant in the bulk at all times during the cycle. Note that
the displacement current within the bulk is not zero and contributes to the total
current. The non-vanishing of the bulk displacement current is primarily due to
temporal variation of bulk electric ﬁeld [see Fig. 4(b); the displacement current
Jd(t) is deﬁned as Jd(t) = −ǫ0(dE/dt)]. The positive ion current across the
discharge is shown in Fig. 6(c). The positive ion current increases only slightly
at the sheath boundary. Comparing Figs. 3 (c) and 6 (c), one can see that
in the electro-negative discharge, the ion current in the bulk varies with time
(this is primarily due to temporal variation of the bulk electric ﬁeld), and has a
smaller modulation within the sheath. Fig. 6(d) shows the negative ion current
across the discharge. Since negative ions are conﬁned to the bulk of the plasma,
the current within the sheath is negligible. However, in the bulk, the negative
ion current oscillates with the applied voltage. Note the small contribution of
positive and negative ion currents to the total current. Finally Fig. 6(e) shows
the total current, which is deﬁned as sum of the electron, positive and negative
ion, and displacement current across the discharge. Although there is a small
blip at the sheath boundary, the total current within the discharge is constant
(experience has shown that the blip diminishes by increasing computation time).
It is worth noting that although plasma density in the two cases are compa-
rable, the total current (as well as the electron, ion and displacement current)
is approximately three times smaller in the electro-negative discharge than the
corresponding currents in the electro-positive plasma.

V. Conclusion

5

In summary, we have presented the PIC/MC simulation results of an electro-
positive and an electro-negative discharge at comparable plasma densities. The
numerical results indicate that the presence of negative ions leads to a relative
maximum at the plasma-sheath boundary, i.e., to the formation of double layers.
This result is in agreement with the experimental measurements. The simulation
results also indicate that unlike the electro-positive discharge, the bulk electric
ﬁeld of the electro-negative plasma has a nonvanishing value and oscillates with
time. This oscillation leads to signiﬁcant bulk displacement current and to
modulation of bulk positive ion current.

Simulation results such as the ones reported here show great promise in
interpreting experimental measurements and in testing the validity of analytical
models and simulation models based on ﬂuid dynamics. Future experiments,
in conjunction with similar Monte Carlo simulations, can provide considerable
information about the details of rf discharges and about the formation of double-
layers.

To describe the high harmonic generation at plasma surfaces in the relativistic regime, we introduce
the concept of apparent reﬂection point (ARP). It appears to an external observer that the radiation
electric ﬁeld is zero at the ARP. The relativistic dynamics of the ARP completely deﬁnes the
generation of high harmonics and attosecond pulses. The ARP velocity is a smooth function of
time. The corresponding γ-factor, however, has sharp spikes at the times when the tangential
vector potential vanishes and the surface velocity becomes close to the speed of light. We show
that managing the laser polarization, one can eﬃciently control the ARP dynamics, e.g., to gate a
single (sub-)attosecond pulse out of the short pulse train generated by a multi-cycle driver. This
relativistic control is demonstrated numerically by particle-in-cell simulations.

High harmonics generated at plasma surfaces in the
relativistic regime [1, 2, 3] are a promising new source of
short wavelength radiation and attosecond pulses, nec-
essary for the study of ultra-fast processes in atoms,
molecules and solids at intensities signiﬁcantly higher
than those obtained from strong ﬁeld laser-atom inter-
actions [4, 5].

The plasma harmonics are generated in the relativistic

regime, when the laser pulse intensity I
Laser pulses in this intensity range usually are several
cycles long. As a consequence, the reﬂected radiation
contains a comb of attosecond pulses. Yet, applications
like molecular imaging [5, 6] or quantum control [7] usu-
ally require a single short pulse to prevent undesirable
eﬀects, e.g., Coulomb explosion. The single attosecond
pulse can be selected either using a phase-stabilized sin-
gle cycle laser [4] or controlling the atomic response by
time-dependent laser polarization [8, 9].

It was shown recently by particle-in-cell (PIC) simu-
lations that in the λ3
regime, when a single-cycle laser
pulse is focused down to a spot of a one wavelength size,
a single attosecond pulse running in a particular direc-
tion can be isolated [10]. However, in the case of a more
realistic several-cycle laser pulse, such casual separation
can be diﬃcult.

In the present work we show for the ﬁrst time that
the managed time-dependent polarization (from elliptical
to linear and back) of the incident laser pulse allows to
gate a single (sub-)attosecond pulse from relativistically
driven plasma surface in a well controlled way. Physi-
cally, the laser pulse polarization controls the relativistic
γ
factor of the apparent reﬂection point (ARP) as seen
by the observer. Although the driving laser pulse can be
long and intense, the ARP velocity becomes highly rela-
tivistic only at the speciﬁc time, when the vector poten-
tial component tangential to the plasma surface vanishes.
Exactly at this moment, the single attosecond pulse is
emitted. The time-dependent polarization corresponds
to two perpendicularly polarized laser pulses with slightly

diﬀerent frequencies and a well chosen phase shift, see
Fig. 1. Experimentally, the time-dependent laser pulse
ellipticity can be achieved by the femtosecond polariza-
tion pulse shaping techniques [9].

We consider the interaction of an ultra-intense short
laser pulse with a slab of overdense plasma. We suppose
that the plasma ions are immobile during the short inter-
action time and study the electron ﬂuid oscillations only.
It was shown in [3] that to describe the high harmonic
generation analytically, the boundary condition Eτ = 0
must be used. Here Eτ is the electric ﬁeld component
tangential to the plasma surface. The physical meaning
of this boundary condition is quite clear. Let us con-

Br/4π. Because the plasma slab is overdense,
S = 0 behind the plasma. If we also neglect the small ab-
sorption, then the observer sees the apparent reﬂection
at the point xARP(t), where the normal component of
the Poynting vector Sn = cEτ
Bτ /4π = 0, implied by
Eτ (xARP) = 0. Thus the boundary condition ensures the
energy conservation. The detailed microscopic derivation
of the boundary condition Eτ (xARP) = 0 and its relation
to the electron dynamics can be found in [11].

The incident laser ﬁeld in vacuum runs in the positive
direction, Ei(x, t) = Ei(x

ct), while the reﬂected

ﬁeld is translated backwards: Er(x, t) = Er(x + ct). The
tangential components of these ﬁelds interfere destruc-
tively at the ARP position xARP(t), so that the implicit
equation for the apparent reﬂection point xARP(t) is:

−

ct) + Er

τ (xARP + ct) = 0.

We stress that Eq. (1) contains the electromagnetic ﬁelds
in vacuum. That is why the reﬂection point xARP is ap-
parent. The real interaction within the plasma skin layer
can be very complex. Yet, an external observer, who
has information about the radiation in vacuum only, sees
that Eτ = 0 at xARP. Strictly speaking, one cannot as-
cribe xARP to any particular density level, e.g., the ”criti-
cal density”. One can only state that the ARP is located
within the skin layer at the electron ﬂuid surface.

≫

The ARP dynamics completely deﬁnes the high har-
monic generation. In the ultra-relativistic regime, when
the dimensionless vector potential a0 = eA0/mc2 of the
laser is large, a2
1, we can apply ultra-relativistic sim-
0
ilarity theory [12] to characterize this motion. The ba-
sic statement of this theory is that when we change the
plasma density Ne and the laser amplitude a0 simultane-
ously keeping the similarity parameter S = Ne/a0Nc con-
stant the laser-plasma dynamics remains similar. Here
Nc = ω2
0m/4πe2 is the critical plasma density for the
laser pulse with the frequency ω0. This means that for
diﬀerent interactions with the same similarity parameter
S=const, the plasma electrons move along the same tra-
jectories, while their momenta p scale with the laser am-
plitude: p
a0. Consequently, the electron momentum
components tangential and normal to the plasma sur-
face scale simultaneously with a0: pτ ∝
a0.
Therefore, in general, the total electron momenta are not
perpendicular to the surface. Moreover, the characteris-
tic angle between their direction and the surface normal
does not depend on a0 provided that S is ﬁxed.

This result is crucial for the plasma surface dynamics.
Since we consider an ultra-relativistic laser pulse, a2

the electrons in the skin layer move with ultra-relativistic

Yet the relativistic γ-factor of the plasma surface γs(t)
and its velocity vs(t) behave in a quite diﬀerent way. Let

us consider electrons at the very boundary of the plasma.
The similarity theory states that the electron momenta
can be represented as pn(t) = a0Pn(S, ωt) and pτ (t) =
a0Pτ (S, ωt), where Pn and Pτ are universal functions,
which do not depend on a0 explicitly, but rather on the
similarity parameter S and on the pulse shape. Thus,
the plasma surface velocity βs(t) = vs(t)/c and γs(t) are

It follows from (3)-(4) that the relativistic γ-factor of
the plasma boundary is of the order of unity for almost
all times, except for those times tg, when the tangential
momentum component vanishes pτ (S, tg) = 0. Exactly
at these times, there are spikes of the γ-factor:

On the contrary, the plasma surface velocity vs as given
by Eq. (3) is a smooth function. It approaches

the electron momentum parallel to the surface vanishes,
i.e., at the same times tg corresponding to the γ-spikes.
The high harmonics are generated at the spikes, when the

It follows from (6) that the γs spikes get higher and nar-
rower when we increase a0, keeping S = const. Thus,
the spikes behave as quasi-singularities. These ultra-
relativistic spikes are the inherent cause for the high har-
monic generation. The (sub-)attosecond pulses [3] are
emitted exactly at the times of the spikes.

We study the motion of the plasma boundary and
the speciﬁc behavior of vARP and γARP numerically us-
ing the 1D PIC code VLPL [13]. The plasma slab
is initially positioned between xL = 1.5λ and xR =
3.9λ, where λ = 2π/ω0 is the laser wavelength. The
laser pulse has the gaussian envelope: a(x, t = 0) =
a0 exp(

x2/σ2) cos(2πx/λ) with σ = 2λ.

At every time step, the incident and the reﬂected ﬁelds
are recorded at x = 0. Being solutions of the wave equa-
tion in vacuum, these ﬁelds can be easily chased to arbi-
trary x and t. To ﬁnd the ARP position xARP, we solve
numerically the equation (1). The trajectory of xARP(t)
for the simulation parameters a0 = 20 and Ne/Nc = 90
(S = 4.5) is presented in Fig. 2 a). One can clearly see
the oscillatory motion of the point xARP(t). The equilib-
rium position is displaced from the initial plasma bound-
ary position xL due to the mean laser light pressure.

Since only the ARP motion towards the laser pulse is
of importance for the high harmonic generation, we cut
out the positive ARP velocities vARP(t) = dxARP(t)/dt
and calculate only the negative ones, Fig. 2 b). The
vARP(t)2/c2 is
corresponding γ-factor γARP(t) = 1/
presented in Fig. 2 c). Notice that the ARP velocity
is a smooth function. At the same time, the γ-factor
γARP(t) contains sharp spikes, which coincide with the
velocity extrema. These spikes of the surface γ-factor
are responsible for the high harmonic generation.

FIG. 3: a) The high harmonics spectrum; b) the train of
attosecond pulses is obtained after the proper ﬁltering.

The numerically obtained spectrum of the high-
harmonics is shown in Fig. 3 a). Filtering out the
lower harmonics and keeping only the harmonics with
ω > 25ω0, we obtain a train of short pulses in the re-
ﬂected radiation, Fig. 3 b).

For various applications, such as molecule imaging, it is
of great importance to have a single short pulse, instead
of a train of short pulses. We have shown above that
the attosecond pulses are emitted when the tangential
components of the surface electron momentum vanish.
This property can be used to control the high harmonic
generation and to gate a particular attosecond pulse out
of the train.

In the 1D geometry, the transverse generalized momen-
tum is conserved: pτ = eAτ /c, where pτ and Aτ are the
tangential components of the electron momentum p and
the vector potential A. Consequently, the attosecond
pulses are emitted when the vector potential is zero. If
the vector potential vanishes at several moments, there
are several γ-spikes and correspondingly, after proper ﬁl-
tering, several short pulses are observed in the reﬂected
radiation, see Fig. 3 b).

To select a single attosecond pulse, we must ensure that
the vector potential Aτ turns zero exactly once. Since Aτ
has two components, how often it vanishes depends on
its polarization. For linear polarization it vanishes twice
per laser period, while for circular or elliptic polarization
it never equals zero. A laser pulse with a time-dependent
polarization can be prepared in such a way that its vector
potential turns zero just once. The time-dependent po-
larization corresponds to two perpendicularly polarized

controlling pulse with amplitude ac = 6 and frequency
ωc = 1.25 and retain the same driver pulse with ampli-
tude a0 = 20, frequency ω0 = 1 and y-polarization. We
keep the same plasma density Ne/Nc = 90. The op-
timal phase diﬀerence between the two lasers is found
empirically to be ∆φ = π/8. The simulation results are
presented in Fig. 4 a) and b). Comparing the surface
γ
factor dynamics in the regime of linear polarization,
Fig. 2 c) and in the controlled regime, Fig. 4 a), we see
that the central γ
spike is slightly larger while the both
side spikes are signiﬁcantly damped. This eﬀect becomes
much more pronounced when we compare the ﬁltered ra-
diation plots, Fig. 3 b) and Fig. 4 b). The control signal
allows us to select the single attosecond pulse correspond-
ing to the highest γ

spike in the surface motion.

Varying the control parameters a0/ac, ω0/ωc and ∆φ
we are able to select diﬀerent attosecond pulses one-by-
one or in groups out of the original pulse train.

To recapitulate, we studied analytically and numeri-
cally the dynamics of the apparent reﬂection point at
the overdense plasma surface. We have shown that the
velocity of this point is a smooth function of time. How-
ever, the corresponding γ-factor has quasi-singularities
or spikes when the surface velocity approaches the speed
of light. These ultra-relativistic spikes are responsible for
the high harmonic generation in the form of an attosec-
ond pulse train. We show that the attosecond pulse emis-
sion can be eﬃciently controlled by managing the laser
polarization. This is done by adding a low intensity con-
trol pulse with perpendicular polarization and frequency
slightly diﬀerent from that of the driving pulse. This rel-
ativistic plasma control allows to gate a single attosecond
pulse or a prescribed group of attosecond pulses.

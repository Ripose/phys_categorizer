Transverse quasilinear relaxation in inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld

Theoretical Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125

Maxim Lyutikov

(25 January 1998)

Transverse quasilinear relaxation of the cyclotron-Cherenkov instability

in the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of pulsar magnetospheres is considered.

We ﬁnd quasilinear states in which the kinetic cyclotron-Cherenkov instability

of a beam propagating through strongly magnetized pair plasma is saturated

by the force arising in the inhomogeneous ﬁeld due to the conservation of the

adiabatic invariant. The resulting wave intensities generally have nonpower

law frequency dependence, but in a broad frequency range can be well approx-

imated by the power law with the spectral index

2. The emergent spectra

and ﬂuxes are consistent with the one observed from pulsars.

I. INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider quasilinear relaxation in inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of a

highly relativistic beam propagating along the strong magnetic ﬁeld through a pair plasma.

This describes the physical conditions on the open ﬁeld lines of pulsar magnetospheres

(e.g. [1]). The possibility of the cyclotron-Cherenkov instability of the beam in the pulsar

magnetosphere has been suggested by [2] and [3] and developed later by [4], [5], [6]. The

cyclotron-Cherenkov instability develops at the anomalous Doppler resonance

factor in the pulsar frame, q is the charge of the resonant particle, m is its mass and c is the

speed of light. It has been shown (e.g. [6]), that cyclotron-Cherenkov instability can explain

a broad variety of the observed pulsar phenomena.

Close to the stellar surface, where the initial beam is produced and accelerated, the

particles quickly reach their ground gyrational state due to the sychrotron emission in a

superstrong magnetic ﬁeld, so that their distribution becomes virtually one dimensional [1].

In the outer parts of magnetosphere it becomes possible to satisfy the anomalous Doppler

resonance - the cyclotron-Cherenkov instability develops bringing about the diﬀusion of

particles in transverse moments. The relevant saturation mechanism then determines the

ﬁnal spectrum (which can be later modiﬁed be the absorption processes).

The nonlinear saturation of the cyclotron-Cherenkov instability due to the diﬀusion of

the resonant particles has been previously considered by several authors. Kawamura &

Suzuki [2] neglected the possible stabilizing eﬀects of the radiation reaction force due to the

cyclotron emission at the normal Doppler resonance and the force arizing in the inhomoge-

neous magnetic ﬁeld due to the conservation of the adiabatic invariant. These forces result

in a saturation of the quasilinear diﬀusion.

Lominadze et al. [3] were the ﬁrst to notice the importance of the radiation reaction force

due to the emission at the normal Doppler resonance on the saturation of the quasilinear

diﬀusion. Unfortunately, Lominadze et al. [3] used an expression for the cyclotron damping

rates which is applicable only for the nonrelativistic transverse motions, when γψ (psi is

the pitch angle) is much less than unity. In the pulsar magnetospheres the development of

the cyclotron-Cherenkov instability results in a diﬀusion of particles in transverse moments,

quickly increasing there transverse energy to relativistic values.

In a review paper Lominadze et al. [7] took a correct account of the radiation reaction

force due to the emission at the normal Doppler resonance and pointed out the importance

of the the force arizing in the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld due to the conservation of

the adiabatic invariant ( G force Eq. (10)). When considering the deceleration of the beam

Lominadze et al. [7] has incorrectly neglected the radiation reaction force due to the emission

at the anomalous Doppler resonance in comparison with the radiation reaction force due to

the emission at the normal Doppler resonance.

In this work we reconsider and extend the treatment of the quasilinear stage of the

2

cyclotron-Cherenkov instability. We have found a state, in which the particles are constantly

slowing down their parallel motion, mainly due to the component along magnetic ﬁeld of

the radiation reaction force of emission at the anomalous Doppler resonance. At the same

time they keep the pitch angle almost constant due to the balance of the force G and the

component perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld of the radiation reaction force of emission

at the anomalous Doppler resonance. We calculate the distribution function and the wave

intensities for such quasilinear state.

In the process of the quasilinear diﬀusion the initial beam looses a large fraction of its

initial energy

10%, which is enough to explain the typical luminosities of pulsars. Though

≈

the quasisteady wave intensities are not strictly power laws (see Eq. (38)), they can well

approximated by a power law with a spectral index F (ν)

2 (F (ν) is the spectral ﬂux

∝ −

density in Janskys) which is very close to the observed mean spectral index of

1.6 [8]. The

predicted spectra also show a turn oﬀ at the low frequencies ν

≤
1GHz which may be related to the possible turn-up in

−
300MHz and a ﬂattering

of spectrum at large frequencies ν

≥

the ﬂux densities at mm-wavelengths [9].

II. QUASILINEAR DIFFUSION

A particle moving in a dielectric medium in magnetic ﬁeld with the velocity larger than

the velocity of light in a medium is emitting electromagnetic waves at the anomalous Doppler

resonance ( s < 0 in Eq. (1)) and at the normal Doppler resonance ( s > 0 in Eq. (1)). The

radiation reaction due to the emission at the normal Doppler resonance slows the particle’s

motion along magnetic ﬁeld and decreases its transverse momentum. The radiation reaction

due to the emission at the anomalous Doppler resonance increases its transverse momentum

and also slows the particle’s motion along magnetic ﬁeld [10]. As the particle propagates

into the region of lower magnetic ﬁeld, the force G decreases the its transverse momentum

and increases the parallel momentum. The stationary state in transverse moments may be

reach when the actions of the G force and radiation reaction due to the emission at the

3

normal Doppler resonance is balanced by the radiation reaction due to the emission at the

anomalous Doppler resonance.

The quasisteady stage may also be considered in terms of a detailed balance of for the

particle transitions between the Landau levels. The quasisteady stage is reached when the

number of induced transitions up in Landau levels due to the emission at the anomalous

Doppler resonance is balanced by the number of the spontaneous transitions down in Landau

levels due to the emission at the anomalous Doppler resonance.

In the Table I we give the dimensions of the main used quantities.

In Eq. (2) we neglected the spontaneous emission processes at the anomalous Doppler

resonance and the induced emission processes at the normal Doppler resonance. The net

eﬀect of the spontaneous emission at the normal Doppler resonance is treated as a damping

4

force acting on each particle in the Boltzman-type left hand side of equation (9). To be

exact, we should have treated the eﬀects of spontaneous emission at the normal Doppler

resonance as stochastic terms in the Fokker-Plank-type terms on the right hand side of

equation (9). But the fact that the emission at the normal Doppler resonance occurs on

very high frequencies at which the presence of a medium is unimportant in the dispersion

relation of the waves and can be neglected allows one to integrate the corresponding terms

over angles and sum over harmonics to obtain a classical synchrotron radiation damping

force, that can be treated using the Boltzman approach. Thus, the total time derivative of

We next solve the partial diﬀerential equation describing the evolution of the distribution

function by sucsessive approximations. We ﬁrst expand equation (2) in small ψ assuming

that ∂/∂ψ

of the plasma ﬂow. Then we assume that it is possible to separate the distribution function

With time, the value of γmin decreases as the particles are slowed down by the radiation

reactions force. Since at the given radius, the particles with lower energies resonate with

waves having larger frequencies, more energy will be transported to higher frequencies hard-

ening the spectrum. The lower frequency cutoﬀ is determined by the initial energy of the

beam. No energy is transported to frequencies lower than

the transverse motion of particles is determined by the balance of a radiation reaction force

due to the emission at anomalous Doppler eﬀect and the force arising in the inhomogeneous

magnetic ﬁeld due to the conservation of adiabatic invariant. The resulting wave intensities

are suﬃcient to explain the observed ﬂuxes from radio pulsars.

1 Introduction

In spite of the fact that Vlasov equations for collisionless plasma appeared
more than half a century ago [4], one can be not satisﬁed with the problem
of solving these equations (and also equations with collision terms). This
problem is related with an evident impossibility to obtain asymptotic solutions
in the plane-wave form exp (iωt + ikx) with complex frequency ω = ω0 + iδ,
independently on the value of real decrement δ.
Indeed, the characteristic
equation for plasma oscillations (more precisely, its imaginary part when one
ﬁnds δ) has the following form

It is evident, that in the case of background Maxwellian plasma with distribu-
tion ∂f0/∂vx < 0 this equation has no solutions for δ at ω0 6
It is well known that formal substitution of plane-wave solution into Vlasov
equations results in appearance of pole divergences in integrals. Correspond-
ingly, integration contour can be arbitrarily selected resulting either in princi-
pal value prescription [4] or in analytical continuation to upper or lower half-

plane (Landau’s continuation produces Landau damping with δ > 0, δ

see [6]). One can relate both selections to some kind of arbitrary solutions
which indeed are not the true asymptotic solutions of Vlasov equations. Be-
sides that, in contrary to doubts presented in [5, 7, 8], Landau’s analytical
continuation is based on the classic Cauchy–Riemann theory and is mathemat-
ically rigorous. It is interesting to note that one can derive Landau damping
solution by expanding formally the integrand in asymptotically divergent se-
ries in powers of small parameter δ/ω0 and taking into account only the ﬁrst
non-divergent terms of this expansion [13].

But there are no reasons to believe that asymptotic solutions of Vlasov
system of partial diﬀerential equations do not exist in principle. A natural
approach has been suggested in [7, 8] to search a solution in the form of a sum
of exponents with amplitudes deﬁned by initial and boundary conditions2. It
should be emphasized that, due to the connection through initial and boundary
conditions, the substitution of this aggregate into the linear Vlasov diﬀerential
equations does not result in decoupling to the sum of independent equations
for separate modes.

First solutions of this type have been obtained in [7, 8] using two-dimensional
(in time t and coordinate x) Laplace transform of self-consistent plasma elec-
Ep1p2. This approach implies searching a pair of poles of

at exponents are then determined by residues in poles and, for given initial
and boundary conditions (see [9, 10]), by additional requirement of solution
ﬁniteness at x, t

.

In what follows we present an attempt to extend this method [5, 9, 10] to the
mi,
case of electron-ion low-collision plasma with heavy and slow ions (me ≪
¯ve, and ω > ωL) . In case of Coulomb collisions we can ﬁnd solutions

2 The null iteration

The plasma is assumed to be Maxwellian, homogeneous and inﬁnite in space
and time with the boundary condition given in the plane x = 0 (the plane
geometry). The Vlasov equations for the simplest case of one-dimensional

3 Coulomb low-collision plasma

Using the standard expression for Coulomb collision integrals [11] in the r.h.s.of
Vlasov equation (2), substituting therein null-iteration electron and ion distri-
bution functions (8) and integrating by parts one obtains quite cumbersome
expressions. These expressions simplify in great extent after neglecting the
small terms of the order O(me/mi), O( ¯vi/ ¯ve), and O [(Teme)/(Timi)] (low mo-
bile ions)3. Then one obtains

The solution with damping in x corresponds to a wave travelling in right
direction (k, δ < 0). Exponentially growing solution (a wave, travelling in left
direction) can be cancelled with a similarly growing term in case of specially
selected boundary function f1(~v, 0, t) (“self-consistency condition”, see [9, 10]).
It is worth to note that according to the notion about travelling waves of

transition from the coordinate decrement to the time decrement is obvious:
δt = Vf rδx. The same expression for δt can be obtained also directly from
Eq.(20) assuming that pole p1 = iω
ω and at collisionless value
of p2 according to (16).

δt with δt ≪

The above obtained expression for δ is characterized by the strong frequency
dependence and is quite diﬀerent from the commonly used one (see [11]) ob-
tained using an expansion in asymptotically divergent series in small parameter
δ/ω, including the third iteration term [12], and producing as a ﬁrst (collision-
less) approximation Landau damping.

4 Conclusions

According to our method [5, 7, 8, 9, 10] of ﬁnding plasma oscillation modes with
the help of 2-dimensional Laplace transformation we have obtained asymptot-
ical solutions of Vlasov equations for the cases of a collisionless plasma and of
a low-collision plasma (with both electron-atom [9] and Coulomb electron-ion
collisions, this paper).

are justiﬁed, ﬁrst of all, by the necessity to demonstrate the possibilities of
the method in various situations and to ﬁnd the main, even only qualitative,
features of the solutions. By this approach we have obtained in the case ω > ωL
a quite new expression, (23), for collision damping decrement in a low-collision
electron-ion plasma with a strong dependence on the frequency ω.

Collisionless damping with energy dissipation (of the Landau damping type)
is absent as we have shown in [9, 10], and if it will be observed experimen-
tally then it will be related to some possible secondary eﬀects such as non-

Maxwellian velocity background, inﬂuence of electron collisions with discharge
tube walls, wave excitation methods, etc.

Any solution of a single exponent type, exp(iωt + ikx), with real or complex
ω and k is not a solution of the dispersion equation for Vlasov equations.
However one can obtain asymptotical solution as a sum of connected exponents
with amplitudes deﬁned by initial and boundary conditions.

We think that the experimental testing of a new expression for damping
decrement is realizable and is very important for the development of the pro-
posed methodology as a whole.

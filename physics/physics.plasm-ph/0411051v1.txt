The stationary state of a spherically symmetric plasma conﬁguration is investigated in the limit
of immobile ions and weak collisions. Conﬁgurations with small radii are positively charged as a
signiﬁcant fraction of the electron population evaporates during the equilibration process, leaving
behind an electron distribution function with an energy cutoﬀ. Such charged plasma conﬁgurations
are of interest for the study of Coulomb explosions and ion acceleration from small clusters irradiated
by ultraintense laser pulses and for the investigation of ion bunches propagation in a plasma.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of ultraintense laser pulses with solid
targets leads to the formation of plasmas with unusual
properties in terms of particle energy distributions and
of spatial mass and charge density distributions. Such
properties can be exploited in order to obtain sources
of high energy electromagnetic radiation and charged
particle beams with unprecedented intensities and time
and space resolutions. For the intensities of present day
ultrashort, superintense laser pulses, the energy that the
ions in a target acquire due to direct interaction with the
electromagnetic ﬁelds of the laser pulse is usually small,
while the energy of the plasma electrons can be of the
order of tens of KeV. These “hot” electrons expand until
their “pressure” is balanced by the electrostatic ﬁeld
that sets up due to spatial charge separation [1, 2, 3].
This process leads to a steady state conﬁguration (SSC)
which is reached in a time of the order of some electron
plasma periods. Thus, since the ion response time is
much longer than that of the electrons, SSC can be
achieved before the ions can depart signiﬁcantly from
their initial conﬁguration. Afterwards ion acceleration
takes place, as predicted theoretically [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and conﬁrmed experimentally
[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Clearly,
this description does not apply to highly relativistic
regimes like those described in [27].
The aim of this paper is to present a combined analytical
and numerical investigation of three dimensional SSC
characterized by a hot electron plasma and a cold
(immobile) ion core. Such conﬁgurations are especially
appealing because, contrary to one dimensional ge-
ometries, in three dimensional cases charged SSC are
expected to set up. In fact, while in the former case an
inﬁnite energy is required in order to bring a charge to
inﬁnity, in the latter the energy necessary for electron
evaporation is ﬁnite.
In particular, we show that the
SSC charging up and the energy distribution of the

∗Electronic address: ceccherini@df.unipi.it

electrons depend on the ratio between the radius of
the ion core and the electron Debye length and on the
history of the electron expansion. The understanding
of the SSC charging up with immobile ions and of
the electron energy distribution is relevant to many
experimental conditions as these processes aﬀect the
way in which ions are accelerated on longer time scales
when the constraint of a ﬁxed ion core is removed. In
the case of the Coulomb explosion of a small cluster
[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] these processes aﬀect the
value of the maximum energy that the ions can acquire
in the acceleration process. Furthermore, in applications
related to proton imaging [39, 40, 41] and to the prop-
agation of ion beams in solid targets [42], the Coulomb
repulsion and the screening eﬀect of the electrons can
strongly aﬀect the proton trajectories. This is also
the case for applications of proton laser acceleration to
hadron therapy [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], where a
very precise collimation of the proton beam and a high
energy resolution are essential. Moreover, as discussed
in [52], the topic of the charging of a spherical plasma in
less extreme conditions can play a key role in the study
of dusty plasmas [53], and aerosols [54].
The paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. II simple
relationships are derived analytically on the basis of
two schematic models that are introduced in order to
grasp the main features of the plasma charging process
in diﬀerent collisionality regimes. In Sec. III we present
the results of a series of numerical simulations obtained
with a one-dimensional Particle in cell code (PIC) in a
spherical geometry and with ﬁxed ions. We then com-
pare the numerically obtained charge values and electron
energy distributions with those obtained from the analyt-
ical models. Finally, conclusions are presented in Sec. IV.

II. SIMPLIFIED MODELS OF THE CHARGING
PROCESS

In this section we discuss two simpliﬁed models that al-
low us to identify the main physical features of the plasma
charging process. These models rely on assigning a sim-
pliﬁed condition for the electrons to leave the ion core

and on two diﬀerent rules for the energy redistribution
of the remaining electrons.
As a starting conﬁguration we assume the following elec-
tron and ion density proﬁles

ne(r) = ni(r) = n0 θ(1

r/R),

(1)

−

with θ(x) = 1 for x > 0 and θ(x) = 0 for x < 0. Here R is
the radius of the ion plasma core and N0 = n0(4πR3/3)
the ion and electron initial particle number. We denote
by Ne the time dependent number of electrons inside
the ion core.
Initially electrons have a Maxwellian energy distribution
with temperature T0. Moreover, in these models the
electron density is taken to be uniform inside the ion
core. As a further simpliﬁcation, we assume that, on
average, the radial crossing of the electron trajectories
does not lead to a relative redistribution of the charge
in front and behind each electron outside the core. This
simpliﬁcation allows us to assume that, after leaving the
ion core each electron moves as if in an eﬀective time
independent Coulomb ﬁeld. Hence, the condition for an
electron to reach inﬁnity is that it has a positive total
energy when it reaches the ion core surface at r = R. In
this model the particles which satisfy this condition are
said to “evaporate” and are assumed to be lost when
they reach r = R. On the contrary, the electrons that
have a negative energy at r = R are assumed to remain
inside the ion core. Furthermore, we assume that inside
the ion core the electrons move as free particles. The
evaporation of the electrons with positive total energy
at r = R changes the number of electrons Ne, the total
energy of the system inside the ion core and causes an
energy redistribution of the remaining electrons.
We discuss the “collisional” regime and the “collision-
less” one. In the ﬁrst one, the electrons which are not
evaporated thermalize at a temperature T , which turns
out to be a decreasing function of time. In the second
regime no thermalization occurs, and the evaporation
causes a progressive depletion in the high energy tail
of the electron distribution function, which remains
isotropic in velocity space.
In what follows, lengths will be measured in units of the
initial Debye length λd = (T0/4πn0e2)1/2, with e the
absolute value of the electronic charge, time t in units
of ω−1
pe = (4πe2n0/me)−1/2, with me the electron mass,
energies in units of the initial electron temperature T0,
velocities in units of the initial electron thermal speed
vth,0 =
T0/me, mass in units of the electron mass and
particle numbers in units of N0. Since inside the ion
core the electron density is taken to be uniform, with the
adopted normalization the normalized electron density
ne and the normalized total number of electrons Ne are
numerically equal.

A. Collisional regime

If the electrons inside the ion core are re-thermalized
by collisions, their velocity distribution function remains
Maxwellian and their time dependent kinetic energy is
given by Uk = 3NeT /2. The electron evaporation rate is
obtained by calculating the ﬂux of electrons with positive
total energy through the core surface. Deﬁning the time
Ne)R2/3T , with
dependent quantity φT = eΦR/T = (1
ΦR the electrostatic potential at the ion core surface, the
positive total energy condition corresponds to v2/2T
φT . Thus we obtain

where τ = R/√T is the electron crossing time inside
the ion core. Analogously, the energy ﬂux ΦU of the
evaporating particle can be computed by noting that
each evaporating electron carries away the residual en-
ergy v2/2T

φT . Then we obtain

ΦU =

The total energy of the system can be written as U =
3NeT /2 + UΦ where UΦ is the electrostatic energy of
the charged conﬁguration which increases as the electrons

B. Collisionless regime

If on the contrary we assume that plasma elec-
trons inside the ion core are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected
by collisions, their distribution function becomes non-
Maxwellian. We assume that the electron distribution
remains homogeneous in coordinate space and isotropic
in velocity space. Thus, denoting by NE the time de-
pendent number of electrons with kinetic energy (nor-
malized on the initial temperatute T0) in the interval

be obtained by approximating the ﬁnal electron distri-

C. Discussion of the analytical models

Numerical integration of Eqs. (2, 8) shows that both in
the collisionless and in the collisional regime the electron
evaporation rate is signiﬁcantly reduced from its initial
value when the quantities φT , φ0 become of order unity.
This means that, in the collisional regime, the evapora-
tion nearly stops when the electron electrostatic energy,
which is an increasing function of time, is of the order
of the electron temperature which decreases with time.
Whereas in the collisionless case the electron evaporation
is signiﬁcant only until the electron electrostatic energy
is of the order of the initial average electron kinetic en-
ergy.
The initial evaporation rate, which is obviously the same
in both, the collisional and in the collisionless case, is
obtained from either Eq. (2) or Eq. (6) which give

Therefore, if t∗ < ˜t, i.e., for ion core radii satisfying
√3, the charging process continues until almost

Finally, we note that the time dependent electron energy
distribution predicted in the collisionless regime is highly
non thermal. The fact that the electron evaporation
only occurs for those particles with kinetic energy

satisfying
|t causes a depletion of the high energy
tail of the electron distribution function, as will be
examined in detail in Sec. III.

III. PIC SIMULATIONS AND COMPARISON
WITH THE ANALYTICAL RESULTS

Our PIC simulations are initialized with the electron
(1). The
and ion density proﬁles ne, ni given by Eq.
initial electron distribution function is Maxwellian with
temperature T0. At time t = 0 the electrons are allowed
to move. During their expansion, the electrons that reach
the border of the simulation box with positive total en-
ergy are removed. Therefore, as the total number of elec-
trons decreases with time, the plasma acquires a net posi-
tive charge and an electrostatic potential sets up. Finally
a stationary state is reached where no more electrons
reach the boundary. We denote by N∞, n∞, E∞, NE,∞
the electron number, the electron density, the electric
ﬁeld proﬁle, and the electron kinetic energy distribution
once SSC has been reached. As expected, our simula-
tions show that these quantities depend on the ion core
radius R.
The results regarding the proﬁle of both the electric ﬁeld
E∞ and of the electron density n∞ for two diﬀerent ion
plasma radii R are presented in Fig. 1. As one can see
in Fig. 1b, the electrons which are outside the ion sphere
are conﬁned in a region whose width is of the order of a
few Debye lengths.

E

The numerical results regarding the electron kinetic
energy distribution in the stationary state are presented
in Fig. 2. In the ﬁgure, the ratio NE,∞/NE,0, is shown
versus the electron kinetic energy
in semi-logarithmic
scale, for several values of the ion plasma radius R. These
results show that the electron kinetic energy distribution
is highly non-thermal. It exhibits a cut in its high energy
tail, and the cutoﬀ energy increases with the ion plasma
radius R.
Regarding the comparison with the semi-inﬁnite, pla-
nar case, our results show that both the electric ﬁeld
and the electron density are very similar to those pre-
sented in [6] only as long as the ion core radius is greater
than several tens of Debye lengths. Since, contrary to

a one-dimensional conﬁguration, in the case of a three-
dimensional conﬁguration the energy required for the
electrons to evaporate is ﬁnite, the diﬀerences observed
are mainly due to the cutoﬀ in the electron high energy
tail. Such cutoﬀ is responsible for the electron density
depletion observed outside the ion core (see Fig. 1b) and,
consequently, for the corresponding electric ﬁeld proﬁle.
As shown in Fig. 1a, in the limit R
1 the value of the
dimensionless electric ﬁeld at the surface of the ion core
is almost independent of R, thus the net dimensionless
charge conﬁned within the ion core scales approximately
as 1/R.
N∞
The comparison between the charge value Q∞ = 1
obtained numerically and that predicted analytically is
shown in Fig. 3, for diﬀerent values of the ion core ra-
dius R. Note that the value of Q∞ obtained numerically
includes all SSC electrons, i.e., the electrons inside the
ionic sphere and those in the surrounding halo. It is seen
that the agreement among the numerical results and the
values obtained in the collisionless regime is very good
in the whole range 5
40. With regard to the thermal
model adopted for the collisional regime we remark that
for small radii it predicts a moderately larger value of
Q∞, but the two diﬀerent regimes lead to very close val-
ues Q∞ in case of large radii.
Our results indicate that collisions can aﬀect the charg-
ing up process only for small ion core radii. This result
can be explained by noting that the potential due to the
electron expansion scales as R2. Thus, as the potential
barrier increases, the fraction of the electron population
that, because of Coulomb collisions, reaches a positive
total energy and can thus leave the ion core decreases.
However, the collisional thermalization of the distribu-
tion function assumed in Sec. II A can only be expected

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have investigated the charging up pro-
cess of a spherically symmetric plasma conﬁguration in
vacuum in the limit of immobile ions. Two diﬀerent sim-
pliﬁed models have been presented. With the help of
these models we have established scaling laws relating
the steady state total charge and electron energy distri-
bution on the radius of the ion core, normalized in terms
of the initial electron Debye length. These scalings have
been validated by mean of spherical one-dimensional PIC
simulations. The agreement we ﬁnd is overall very good.
Charged plasma conﬁgurations such as those investigated
in this paper occur naturally in the interaction of ultrain-
tense laser pulses with matter and are of interest, e.g.,
for setting the initial conditions in the study of Coulomb
explosions and ion acceleration from small clusters irra-
diated by ultraintense laser pulses.
In particular, regarding the problem of cluster expansion
the analytical and numerical results that we have pre-
sented show that a spherically symmetric conﬁguration
of cold ions and hot electrons, which is the typical start-
ing conﬁguration in cluster expansion experiments, does
not evolve towards a neutral conﬁguration, in contrast
with the one-dimensional planar case. This charging up
eﬀect can strongly modify the maximum energy that the
ions can gain and the typical timescale on which their
acceleration occurs.

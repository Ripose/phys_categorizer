Electromagnetic radiation is strongly absorbed by the magnetized plasma if its frequency equals
the cyclotron frequency of plasma electrons. It is demonstrated that absorption can be completely
canceled in the presence of a second radiation beam, or even a magnetostatic ﬁeld of an undula-
tor, resulting in plasma transparency at the cyclotron frequency. This eﬀect is reminiscent of the
electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) of the three-level atomic systems, except that it oc-
curs in a completely classical plasma. Also, because of the complexity of the classical plasma, index
of refraction at cyclotron frequency diﬀers from unity. Potential applications of the EIT in plasma
include selective plasma heating, electromagnetic control of the index of refraction, and electron/ion
acceleration.

Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in
quantum-mechanical atomic systems is a well under-
stood and thoroughly studied [1] subject. EIT is the
basis of several very important applications, such as
slow light [3], information transfer between matter and
light [4,5], sound wave generation [6], or even testing
of the black-hole physics [7]. Several recent reviews [2]
illucidated the quantum mechanical mechanism of EIT
which relies on the destructive interference between sev-
eral pathways which connect the ground and excited
states of the atom. The purpose of this Letter is to de-
scribe EIT in a classical plasma.

We consider an externally magnetized plasma with
~B = B0~ez and density n0. A right-hand polarized elec-
tromagnetic wave (which we refer to as the probe) at the
frequency ω1 equal to cyclotron frequency Ω0 = eB0/mc
cannot propagate in the plasma because it undergoes
resonant cyclotron absorption [8]. The cold magne-
tized plasma dispersion relation ω1 v. s.k1 for the right-
hand polarized probe, plotted in Fig. 1,

bandgap develops between Ω0 and Ωc =

Ω0/2, where ωp = (4πe2n0/m)1/2 is the plasma fre-
quency. This Letter demonstrates that by adding a
second intense electromagnetic wave (pump) with fre-
quency ω0 = Ω0 − ωp create a transparency near the
cyclotron frequency. Moreover, if ωp = Ωc, transparency
can be created by a magnetostatic undulator with arbi-
trary wavenumber k0.

The classical mechanism of the electromagnetically in-
duced transparency is the destructive interference be-
tween the electric ﬁeld of the probe ~E1⊥ and the side-
bands of the electric ~E0⊥ and magnetic ~B0⊥ ﬁelds of
the pump which are produced by the collective electron
plasma oscillation with frequency ωp along the magnetic
ﬁeld. Qualitatively, the total force at the cyclotron fre-

quency experienced by a plasma electron is given by

then Therefore,
if the amplitudes and phases of the
pump and the plasma wave are properly correlated, then
~Ftot = 0. Consequently, the plasma current at the cy-
clotron frequency is small (or even vanishing), and the
probe propagates as if in vacuum. Our numerical simula-
tion below demonstrates that this correlation is naturally
achieved in a collisionless plasma.

where ~x ≡ (z0 +ζz)~ez +~x⊥ and ~v = d~x/dt are the particle
position and velocity, and the initial conditions are ~v = 0
and ~x = z0~ez. The third term in the lhs of Eq. (1) is the
restoring force of the ions [9].

Equation (1) was integrated for two cases: (a) when
only a probe ﬁeld is turned on, and (b,c) when both the
pump and the probe are turned on. The pump and the
probe amplitudes were increased adiabatically in time,
up to their respective peak amplitudes of a0 and a1, ac-
cording to

enabling the pump to turn on ﬁrst, followed by the probe.

Simulation results for ωp/Ω0 = 0.3 (ω0 = 0.7Ω0) are
shown in Fig. 2. Without the pump electron is resonantly
driven by the probe as shown in Fig. 2(a). In the plasma,
this growth manifests itself in a large electron current and
probe absorption because, time-averaged, ~E⊥ · ~v⊥ < 0.
Adding a strong pump with a0 = 0.1 and k0 ≈ 0.83Ω0/c
dramatically changes electron motion, see Fig. 2(b). Af-
ter the pump is turned on but before the turning on of
the probe, electron oscillates in the ﬁeld of the pump
according to βx0 = ω0apump/(ω0 − Ω0) sin (k0z0 − ω0t).
Switching on the probe does not signiﬁcantly alter elec-
tron motion: βx − βx0 is shown as a barely visible dashed
line in Fig. 2(b)). Comparing Figs. 2(a) and (b), observe
that the pump suppressed electron responce at the cy-
clotron frequency, making the plasma transparent to the
probe.

motion in the combined ﬁeld of two EM waves with
(ω1 = Ω0,k1 = ω1/c) and (ω0 = Ω0 − ωp, k0 ≈ 0.83Ω0/c).
Both pump and probe are slowly turned on according to
Eq. (2). (a) Without the pump electron is resonantly driven
by probe: βx growth indeﬁnitely; (b) With the pump, elec-
tron motion is almost unaﬀected by the probe. Solid line

βx0 = ω0apump/(ω0 − Ω0) sin (k0z0 − ω0t). Since βx − βx0.
(c) Solid line: longitudinal displacement Ω0ζz/c; dashed line:
Ω0(ζz − ζ0)/c, where ζ0 = 2apump/aprobe sin ωpt from Eq. (3)

Suppression is caused by the excitation of a strong
plasma [shown in Fig. 2(c)] which produced a sideband
of the pump at the cyclotron frequency. This sideband
canceled the electric ﬁeld of the probe. An approximate
analytic formula for the steady-state amplitude of the
plasma oscillation,

ζ0 =

2aprobe
k0apump

sin ωpt,

(3)

is derived below by requiring that the sideband cancels
the probe. which is in good agreement with the simu-
lation result. Simulation results demonstrate stability of
the steady-state values of βx and ζz which are naturally
reached in a collisionless plasma. Note that the pump
has to be switched on prior to the arrival of the probe.
In atomic physics, this pulse sequence is referred to as
“counter-intuitive” [2].

Maintaining high-power pumping waves in the plasma
may prove challenging in practice. For example, sup-
porting a0 = 0.01 over an area A = (2πc/ω0)2 re-
quires microwave power of 3 megawatts. Fortunately,
for ωp = Ω0, a magnetostatic helical undulator can re-
place a microwave beam. We simulated electron motion
in the combined ﬁeld of an undulator with a0 = 0.1 and
k0 = 2Ω0/c, and a probe which is switched on accord-
ing to aprobe = 0.5a1 (1 + tanh [(Ω0t − 270)/60]), where
a1 = 0.01. Suppression of the electron responce at the
cyclotron frequency is apparent from Fig. 3(a). Electric
ﬁeld of the probe is canceled by the ( ˙ζz/c)~ez × ~B0⊥ force
which is exerted on a longitudinal plasma wave by the
helical magnetic ﬁeld of the undulator.
Steady-state values of β+ = β∗

− = βx − iβy and ζz
can be analytically obtained by linearizing Eq. (1) in the
weak probe a1 ≪ a0 limit.

The last term in the RHS of Eq. (6) will be later dropped
because it is proportional to the product of two small
quantities, ζz and a1. Note that, unlike the transverse
velocity β+ which is excited directly by each of the two
lasers according to Eq. (5), plasma waves are excited only
in the presense of two lasers via the beatwave mecha-
nisms.

The physical reason for EIT in plasma is the strong
coupling between longitudinal and transverse degrees of
freedom of the plasma electrons. The steady-state solu-
tion of Eq. (6) ζz = 0.5˜ζ exp i(∆kz − ∆ωt) + c. c. , where
∆ω = ω1 − ω0 and ∆k = k1 − k0, is substituted into the
transverse equation of motion (5). Retaining the terms
with exp −iω0t and exp −iω1t dependence results in

(ω1 = k2
δ ¯Ω0 ≈ (2ω0Ω2

quency shift is in general very small in the most interest-
ing regime of ΩR ≪ ωp: |δΩ0| < 4Ω2
R/ωp ≪ ΩR, and can
be even smaller near cyclotron resonance when pump and
probe co-propagate. Equation (10) reduces to the disper-
sion relation for a single probe in magnetized plasma for
large detunings (δΩ)2 ≫ Ω2
R. The inﬂuence of the pump
is signiﬁcant only in the vicinity of δΩ = 0.

Note that index of refraction is not identically equal
to unity at the cyclotron resonance. This is diﬀerent
from the quantum-mechanical result for a three-level sys-
tem [11], where ω1 = k1c on resonance. It can be demon-
strated that this diﬀerence occurs because multiple Lan-
dau levels En = n¯hΩ0 and corresponding Raman-shifted

labeled “EIT Band” corresponds to “slow light” and appears
only in the presence of a pump.

One interesting application of EIT in magnetized
plasma is ion acceleration. While laser-plasma accelera-
tors of electrons [12] have long been considered as a long-
term alternative to conventional rf cavity-based linacs,
the ﬁeld of plasma-based ion accelerators is still in its
infancy [13]. EIT enables one to conceive a short-pulse
ion accelerator which consists of a “slow light” pulse in
plasma with approximately equal group and phase veloc-
ities. Acceleration is accomplished by the longitudinal
electric ﬁeld of the plasma wave. Counter-propagating
geometry is chosen to match the phase and group veloc-
ities because vph = ωp/|k0| + k1 ≈ 0.5cωp/Ω0. Matching
vph = vg yields a0 ≈ ω2
p/Ω2
0 ≪ 1. Other types of ac-
celerators based on the “slow light” which rely on the
ponderomotive force also appear attractive because the
ponderomotive force, which scales as the gradient of the
z /Lf ∝ (ωp/Ω0)U0/v2
energy density E2
g, increases rapidly
with decreasing group velocity of the probe.

Dispersion relation given by Eq. (10) is plotted in
Fig. (4) for the same plasma parameters as in Fig. (1),
plus a co-propagating pump with ΩR = 0.5ωp. The
ﬂat band between the Ω0 ± ΩR resonant frequencies is
a novel feature which is not present without the pump
(compare with Fig. (1)). The width of this EIT band
proportional to ΩR ∝ a0 can become very narrow for
low pump amplitude. The corresponding “group veloc-
ity” (understood in a stricly geometrical sense explained
below) vg = ∂ω1/∂k1 ≈ 2cΩ2
p can also be made arbi-
trarily small. Slowly propagating wavepacket of electro-
magnetic waves is a classical analog of the “slow light”
in atomic systems [3].

R/ω2

Qualitatively, the spectacular slowing down of EM
waves in the EIT plasma can be understood by con-
sidering the entrance of a probe beam of duration L0
into the plasma.
In steady state inside the plasma,
the “slow light” wavepacket of length Lf consists of the
transversely polarized ﬁeld of the probe | ~E1| = | ~B1| =
a1mcω1/e and the longitudinal electric ﬁeld of the plasma
wave Ez = 4πen0(2a1/k0a0). As the pulse enters the
plasma, it loses photons to the pump at the same rate
as new plasmons are created (according to the Manley-
Rowe relation). Classical photon density of a ﬁeld with
frequency ω is proportional to the action density ∝ U/ω,
where U is the energy density. We calculate that the
ratio of the plasmon to photon density inside the “slow
light” pulse,

is ≫ 1 if ΩR ≪ ωp. Thus, most photons of the original
pulse are lost to the pump. Since the index of refrac-
tion remains close to unity, so is the photon energy den-
sity. Therefore, the loss of photons is due to the spatial
shortening of the pulse from L0 to Lf = L0 × (2Ω2
p).
Because temporal pulse duration does not change, we re-
cover the previously calculated vg/c = 2Ω2
It is
precisely in this geometric sense of vg/c = Lf /L0 that
the group velocity of the slow light is interpreted. vg is
not related to the speed of individual photons since their
number is not conserved during the pulse transition into
the plasma.

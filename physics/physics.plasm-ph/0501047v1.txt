Temporal evolution of lower hybrid waves in the presence
of ponderomotive density ﬂuctuations

The propagation of lower hybrid waves in the presence of ponderomotive density ﬂuctu-
ations is considered. The problem is treated in two dimensions and, in order to be able
to correctly impose the boundary conditions, the waves are allowed to evolve in time.

ray. The behavior of the waves is investigated numerically. If the amplitude of the waves
is large enough, the spectrum of the waves broadens and their parallel wavelength
becomes shorter. The assumptions made in the formulation preclude the application of
these results to the lower hybrid heating experiment on Alcator–A. Nevertheless, there
are indications that the physics embodied in this problem are responsible for some of
the results of that experiment.

INTRODUCTION.

The injection of rf power near the lower hybrid frequency is an attractive method for
the auxiliary heating of tokamak plasmas.1 Because of the high powers required (several
MW) and because lower hybrid waves principally propagate along well-deﬁned resonance
cones,2–4 there has been considerable interest in nonlinear eﬀects on the propagation of lower
hybrid waves. This problem was ﬁrst addressed by Morales and Lee5 who studied the two-
dimensional electrostatic propagation of one of the two lower hybrid rays in a homogeneous
plasma. Although this is perhaps the simplest model that can be considered, a correct
treatment of this problem has yet to be made. It is this deﬁciency that this paper attempts
to remedy.

−

Brieﬂy the diﬃculty of this problem arises as follows: If it is assumed that the rf ﬁelds in
the plasma have reached a steady state, i.e., that the potential is given by φ(x, z) exp(
iω0t)
(x and z are coordinates perpendicular and parallel to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld B0), then
the electric ﬁeld obeys the complex modiﬁed Korteweg–deVries equation.5–7 This equation is
mathematically well-posed when solved as an initial value problem in one of the coordinates
x, that is when φ(x = 0, z) is given. Unfortunately, this does not correspond to physically
realizable boundary conditions since waves can propagate in both the +x and
x directions
in a single ray.7, 8 When the correct boundary conditions are imposed, there is numerical
evidence that solutions of the complex modiﬁed Korteweg–deVries equation need not exist
and that this equation is therefore ill-posed.7 This is conﬁrmed by our ﬁnding solutions
inconsistent with the assumption of a steady state (see Sec. IV). The problem arises because
the direction of power ﬂow which determines how to impose the boundary conditions is
deﬁned only with reference to a problem in which a temporal evolution of the wave packet is
allowed. In assuming a steady state for the electric ﬁeld amplitude, the equation no longer
has built into it the crucial ingredient which determines how the boundary conditions are
imposed. This defect is corrected by including a slow time dependence of the potential [so
that the potential is given by φ(x, z, t) exp(
iω0t)]. This then leads to a nonlinear partial
−
diﬀerential equation in two spatial dimensions and time, which we will study numerically in
this paper.

−

In formulating this problem, we shall ignore many eﬀects which should possibly be
included to obtain a complete understanding of the propagation of lower hybrid waves.
This will enable us to study the eﬀect of the nonlinearity in as simple a system as possible.
Even so, the numerical solution of a partial diﬀerential equation in two dimensions and
time is time consuming and, as we shall see, the behavior of the ﬁelds as described by this
equation can be quite complicated. In the absence of any analytical methods for solving
this equation, we must therefore be content with the solution for only a few cases. This
will enable us to conﬁrm the threshold for strong nonlinear eﬀects given in Ref. 7 and to
give a more complete description of the nature of these nonlinear eﬀects. Because of the
approximations made in formulating the problem, we shall not be able to apply these results
to the propagation of lower hybrid waves near the edge of a tokamak plasma where nonlinear
eﬀects are most strong. However, there are indications that the physical processes that are
considered in this paper do play a role in the propagation in that region.

The plan of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II we derive the partial diﬀerential equation
governing the temporal evolution of φ. The basic properties of this equation will be discussed
in Sec. III. In particular, we will show how the right boundary conditions automatically
drop out from the equation. Since the equation is analytically intractable, we resort to a
numerical integration, the results of which are given in Sec. IV. The threshold condition

– 3 –

for a strong nonlinear interaction is derived in Sec. V. The results are summarized and the
consequences to lower hybrid heating of tokamaks are presented in Sec. VI.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM.

In this section, we derive the partial diﬀerential equation governing the evolution of the
electric ﬁeld for one of the lower hybrid rays in two spatial dimensions and time. We assume
that the ﬁelds are electrostatic, that the plasma is homogeneous, and that it is immersed
in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. The derivation closely follows that of the complex modiﬁed
Korteweg–deVries equation by Morales and Lee;5 the additional ingredient we consider is
the slow time dependence of φ.

The potential of the lower hybrid wave is taken to have the form

Re[φ(x, z, t) exp(

iω0t)]

−

where the t dependence of φ is taken to be much slower than ω0. Since we are only doing the
two-dimensional problem, we have ∂/∂y
0. In the electrostatic limit, φ obeys Poisson’s

Since it is more usual to write K as a normal function, rather than as an operator,
we rewrite K as K(k, ω, n) where k is the Fourier-transform variable conjugate to space,
ω is that conjugate to time, and n is the plasma density.

In general, both the right- and left-going rays will be present. However, if the source
of the lower hybrid rays is localized, the two rays will be separated far from the source and
in that region we may then treat each ray in isolation. Similarly, only a single ray will be
present if the source is adjusted so that only that ray is excited. We may therefore assume
that, to zeroth order, only the right-going ray is present, i.e., φ− = 0. To order ǫ1, we

that C and D have the same signs has an important eﬀect on the propagation of the lower
hybrid waves.

This invariance allows us, for example, to normalize the scale length of the ray in the ζ
direction to unity.

If we set ∂/∂τ = 0 in Eq. (6), we obtain, as expected, the complex modiﬁed Korteweg–
deVries equation as the equation obeyed by steady-state ﬁelds.
If ∂/∂ξ = 0, we obtain
the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, which is soluble by the inverse scattering method.13
Unfortunately, not much use can be made of this fact because, as we shall see, the imposition
of the correct boundary conditions involves solving Eq. (6) in a ﬁnite domain in ξ.

For each of the four conservation laws obtained for the complex modiﬁed Korteweg–
deVries equation, there is a corresponding conservation law for Eq. (6). These are given in

and energy respectively. We will return to these shortly.

In order to determine the correct boundary conditions for Eq. (6), we Fourier transform

in ζ. Deﬁning the Fourier transform of v by

Given that we are treating a nonlinear problem, it may be a little surprising the bound-
ary conditions are applied in the same way as for the corresponding linear problem. The
mathematical reason for this is that the nonlinear term does not involve any τ or ξ deriva-
tives. This arises because, in deriving Eq. (6), we assumed that the nonlinear term was very
small. The expressions for the energy density, power density, etc. are therefore correctly
given by linear theory. Although the nonlinearity is small, it can have a ﬁnite eﬀect because
the ordering also assumes that the length over which the interaction takes place is large.

Notice that the nature of the equation has forced us to take boundary conditions which
are in accord with physical notions of power ﬂow. This has happened because we have the
time variation in Eq. (6). If we consider the steady-state equation, the complex modiﬁed
Korteweg–deVries equation, which is obtained by setting ∂/∂τ = 0 in Eq. (6)

then we would clearly like to impose the same boundary conditions as for Eq. (6) namely
Eq. (10). But the concept of power ﬂow cannot be deﬁned from Eq. (13) and so there is no
guarantee that the boundary conditions given in Eq. (10) are sensible. Indeed, the evidence
of Ref. 7 suggests that Eq. (13) is ill-posed with these boundary conditions. This can be so
because, even if Eq. (6) is given steady-state boundary conditions, i.e.,

V (ξ0 < ξ < ξ1, κ, τ0

),

V (ξ0, κ > 0, τ ) =

V (ξ1, κ < 0, τ ) = 0,

it is not necessarily the case that the solution to Eq. (6) approaches a steady state.

As mentioned in Sec. II, the ordering we used in deriving Eq. (6) was a maximal
ordering. We can eliminate some of the terms in Eq. (6) using a subsidiary ordering. E.g.,
the linear limit is obtained by letting v
0. Similarly, the
non-dispersive limit is obtained by letting ζ

0. It is instructive to examine this case in more detail because there are indications
ξ0 is suﬃciently large then the dispersive term must be included. Consider the

steady-state equation (13) without the dispersive term vζζζ. Multiplying this equation by
v∗ and adding the complex conjugate (these are the same operations that lead to the second
conservation law in Table I), we obtain

mented by another equation. However, this is not so if we impose initial conditions v(ξ =
ξ0, ζ). As is well known, the solution develops a shock at ξ = ξ0 + 1/ max[du(ξ = ξ0, ζ)/dζ],
where ∂u/∂ζ is inﬁnite. Before this point is reached the ordering assumed for the inde-
pendent variables, i.e., that ∂/∂ζ = O(δ), breaks down. Inclusion of the dispersive term
prevents the shock from forming. Indeed, Eq. (13) when treated as an initial value problem
in ξ is well-posed in an inﬁnite domain in ξ. Although Eq. (6) with the correct boundary
conditions is diﬀerent from Eq. (13) with initial conditions, it is likely that Eq. (6) is also
ill-posed if the dispersive term is ignored and if the width of the domain in ξ is large enough.

We begin by considering the linear non-dispersive limit; i.e., we remove the third and
fourth terms in Eq. (6a). Figure 1 shows the solution at various times. Early in the evolution
of the waves, only the lowest κ components have propagated throughout the plasma because
these have the greatest group velocities. Later on, the other κ components have had time
to reach the far end of the system, and the steady state is attained. As τ
, we
have v = v(ζ). In the original (x, z) coordinate system, this corresponds to the familiar
propagation along resonance cones.

→ ∞

In order to further diagnose the results, we identify three sets of waves, the incident
waves (ξ = 0 and κ > 0), the reﬂected waves (ξ = 0 and κ < 0), and the transmitted
waves (ξ = ξ1 and κ > 0). With our choice of boundary conditions the incident waves are
constant for τ > 0 and there are no waves incident at the boundary ξ = ξ1. We deﬁne
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients, R and T , as the ratios of the instantaneous power
reﬂected and the instantaneous power transmitted to the incident power. These powers are
deﬁned by integrating
over the appropriate segment of the boundary. Note that, because
energy can be stored in the plasma, we need not have R + T = 1, although this is true
in a time-averaged sense. Furthermore, it is possible that R or T can momentarily exceed
unity. In order to determine where in κ space the power is concentrated, we deﬁne
for
each wave component as the ratio of the force to the power for that component. (Since

We now turn to the nonlinear dispersive problem. Because we expect that the eﬀect of
the nonlinearity will increase with both v0 and ∆ξ, we begin with a case where these quan-
tities are chosen small enough that the nonlinearity only weakly modiﬁes the propagation.
Figure 3 shows the solution for such a case with v0 = 3, κ0 = 0, and ∆ξ = 0.1. It is found
that v attains a steady state by τ = 2 approximately and only this state is shown in Fig.
3. The evolution to this steady state is similar to that for the linear equation. In Fig. 4
are displayed the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients. Note that the reﬂection coeﬃcient
settles down to a small value (somewhat less than 2%).

As the amplitude of the boundary value v0 is increased, the solution exhibits quite
diﬀerent behavior from the linear solution. In Fig. 5, we have chosen the same parameters
as in Fig. 3, except that v0 has been increased to 4. Now v appears never to reach a
steady state, but instead oscillates in some aperiodic fashion. This can be seen in Fig.
6, where R, T ,
it are plotted. From Fig. 5, we can see what is happening
during these oscillations. Various κ components in the forward wave nonlinearly interact to
produce a reﬂected wave [Fig. 5(b)]. This interaction causes a severe depletion of the low κ
components of the forward wave and transfer of this energy into higher κ components of the
forward wave and into the reﬂected wave [Fig. 5(c)]. After the interaction has nearly gone
to completion, the nonlinearly excited components of the ﬁeld transit out of the system
and the ﬁelds relax to a state in which there is little variation in
with ξ [Fig. 5(d)].
The nonlinear interaction then begins again and the cycle approximately repeats itself [Fig.

– 9 –

5(e)]. In ζ space, this interaction is manifested by a narrowing and peaking of the electric
ﬁeld amplitude v. A typical ﬁeld pattern is shown in Fig. 5(f).

ii ≈

Returning to Fig. 6, we see that the reﬂection is appreciable, oscillating around about
20%. Correspondingly, T oscillates around 80%. Because the energy stored in the ﬁeld
comes out in bursts, T is occasionally greater than unity. Finally, we note that
it exceeds
κ
h

1.25 by approximately a factor of 2.

Because the long-time solution of the ﬁelds does not reach a steady state, it is useful to
describe the solution in terms of its temporal spectrum. To do this, we take a time record of
the transmitted and reﬂected waves for τa < τ < τb. We choose τa to be large enough for the
τa to be large enough to include
transients to have disappeared from the solution and τb −

In Fig. 7, we plot the output spectrum V (ξ′, κ, σ) for the case shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
The spectrum is computed between τa = 1 and τb = 5. The large peaks at σ = 0 are the
steady-state components of the transmitted and reﬂected waves. The broad spectrum in σ
is symptomatic of the aperiodic nature of the waves. There is an interesting correlation in
the spectrum: the positive frequency (σ) components of both the transmitted and reﬂected
waves tend to have larger values of

than the negative frequency components.

We have seen that the solution becomes more turbulent and that the reﬂection increases
as v0 is increased. The other parameters that may be varied are ∆ξ and κ0. We now
investigate the inﬂuence of these parameters.

We begin by varying ∆ξ. Figure 8 shows the output spectrum for v0 = 4, κ0 = 0 and
∆ξ = 0.05. We see that there is almost no energy in the components of the wave with

it is only slightly
greater than
ii (1.4 as compared to 1.25). On the other hand, if we increase the value
of ∆ξ to 0.2 (twice its value in Fig. 7), a broad turbulent spectrum is recovered (Fig. 9).
Although R and
it have approximately the same values as for ∆ξ = 0.1, there is now
more energy in the non-steady components of the output spectrum.

Figures 10 and 11 show the eﬀect on the output spectrum of increasing κ0 (keeping

narrow bands indicating that the solution is nearly periodic. Furthermore, the reﬂected
wave consists almost entirely of negative frequency components. The reﬂection coeﬃcient
for this case is about 12%, or half of what it was with κ0 = 0. The increase of

V. THRESHOLD FOR THE NONLINEARITY.

In the case shown in Figs. 5–7, the nonlinearity causes three phenomena of importance
to lower hybrid heating experiments: (1) the reﬂection coeﬃcient is appreciable; (2) the
solution reaches a turbulent state; (3) the mean wavenumber of the waves transmitted into
the plasma is increased. Comparing the results presented here with those of Sec. VIII of
Ref. 7 in which the solution of the steady-state problem was attempted, we see that the
conditions for the occurrence of these phenomena closely agree with the conditions under
which the steady-state problem had no solution and reﬂection was large.

Before quoting the threshold results from Ref. 7, we use the scaling invariance Eq. (8)

to rewrite the boundary condition Eq. (15b) as

V (ξ = 0, κ > 0, τ > 0) = v0π u(κ

In real space, we have

v(ξ = 0)

|κ>0 = v0[1 + (ζ/∆ζ)Z(ζ/∆ζ)] exp(iκ0ζ).

This roughly corresponds to excitation of lower hybrid waves by a waveguide array of width
∆ζ. The amplitude of the electric ﬁeld in the plasma is v0 and the phasing of the waveguides
is such as to give a wavenumber of κ0. Thus, if the waveguides are phased 0, π, 0, π, . . . ,
we have κ0 = πM/∆ζ where M is the number of waveguides.
[The average wavenumber
of the spectrum of a single lower hybrid ray is
ii which, for M large, is approximately
κ0 + 2(2/π)1/2/∆ζ. The ﬁrst term is attributable to the phasing of the waveguides and the
second term arises because of the ﬁnite width of the waveguide array.]

VI. DISCUSSION.

We have examined the nonlinear evolution of a lower hybrid wave in two dimensions
and time. Under the conditions given in Eq. (17), the nonlinearity can cause appreciable
reﬂection, turbulent variation in the ﬁelds, and an increase in the wavenumbers of the
In Ref. 7, it was found that these conditions could be satisﬁed in a
transmitted waves.
small laboratory plasma or near the edge of a tokamak plasma. In such circumstances, the
assumption of a steady state and the analyses in Refs. 5–7 based on this assumption are
wrong.

The most important application of lower hybrid waves is for heating a tokamak plasma
to ignition temperatures. It is therefore important to understand the processes that may
modify the lower hybrid waves before they have penetrated to the center of the plasma.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain quantitative estimates of these eﬀects with the
theory as outlined in the preceding sections. The reason is that, as we have pointed out, the
nonlinearity is only important in a tokamak near the edge of the plasma and in that region
many other physical processes are likely to be involved. Examples of eﬀects which should
probably be included to give a full understanding of lower hybrid wave propagation near the
edge are: nonlinear coupling to the second (left-going) ray; electromagnetic eﬀects; density
and temperature gradients; saturation of the nonlinearity; ion inertia in the low frequency
equations; coupling to low-frequency drift waves.

Although Eq. (6) should be regarded as a very simpliﬁed model equation describing
the propagation of lower hybrid waves near the edge of a tokamak plasma, some of the
phenomena predicted by this equation have been observed in the lower hybrid heating
experiment on Alcator–A.14, 15 The CO2-laser scattering diagnostic on that experiment
indicated a broadening of the frequency spectrum of the waves. This is consistent with
the turbulent spectra seen in the solutions of Eq. (6). Furthermore, the spectrum becomes
asymmetric as the wave propagates into the plasma, the peak of the spectrum being shifted
down from the frequency of the injected waves. This may be a result of the observation in
Sec. IV that the components of the transmitted and reﬂected waves which are down-shifted
in frequency have a smaller (in absolute value) wavenumber than those which are up-shifted.
If those waves with higher wavenumbers are preferentially damped as the wave travels into
the plasma (e.g., by electron Landau damping), we would expect to see a net downwards
shift in the spectrum of waves.

The other somewhat puzzling result of the Alcator–A experiment was the apparent
independence of the heating results to the phasing of the waveguides. In addition, in order
to explain the density dependence of the heating results, it was postulated that the nz
(parallel index of refraction kzc/ω) spectrum of the waves was shifted to being peaked at
around nz = 5 irrespective of the phasing of the waveguides. (This is to be compared with
values of nz predicted on the basis of linear theory of less than 1.5 for the waveguides in phase
and of 3 for the waveguides out of phase.) Again, this is qualitatively in agreement with
the theoretical results of Sec. IV. There, the average wavenumber of the waves transmitted
from the nonlinear region into the center of the plasma was roughly twice that of the wave
injected into the nonlinear region when κ0 = 0 (corresponding to the wave guides being in
phase). As the phase diﬀerence between neighboring waveguide becomes ﬁnite (i.e., as κ0
is increased), the amount by which the wavenumber spectrum is shifted is reduced.

It is not clear whether the nonlinear reﬂection predicted by the theory given in this
paper would be observed as an increase in the reﬂected power measured in the waveguides.

– 12 –

It may be that this power is reﬂected again on the cutoﬀ at ω = ωpe very close to the plasma
edge. This would convert the power into the other lower hybrid ray.

Thus, it appears that the physics included in Eq. (6) may be responsible for some of the
results of the Alcator–A experiment. In order to be able to say deﬁnitively whether or not
the experimental observations are a result of the processes included in Eq. (6), two advances
are required. Firstly, the theory has to be reﬁned to a point where quantitative comparisons
are possible. Secondly, additional experimental observations are required.
(At present,
Alcator–A is the only tokamak experiment for which the detailed observations provided by
the CO2-laser scattering diagnostic are available. In addition, it would be helpful to have
accurate measurements of the plasma conditions near the edge of the plasma.)

We should point out that other theories have beeen advanced to explain the Alcator–A
results. In particular, Bonoli and Ott16 have suggested a linear theory. This is supported
by the observed linear dependence between the density ﬂuctuations and the applied power
(over a fairly large range) which suggests either that the phenomena are linear or else that
the nonlinear processes saturate at a low amplitude.

Another interesting theoretical result, given by Morales,17 concerns the coupling of rf
energy into lower hybrid waves at the plasma edge. A density gradient was included in his
model and a temporal evolution was allowed. As in the theory presented here, it was found
that a steady state need not be reached; rather, the rf energy entered the plasma in bursts
similar to the behavior seen in Fig. 5. However, only a single nz component was included
so that the nonlinear coupling of diﬀerent nz components was disallowed.

In summary, we have presented a theory of the nonlinear propagation of lower hybrid
waves. At suﬃciently large powers, the ﬁelds become turbulent and the wavenumber spec-
trum is shifted upwards. The theory should accurately describe the propagation in small
laboratory devices. While we may expect qualitatively similar results near the edge of a
tokamak plasma, other physical eﬀects need to be included to obtain an accurate description
of the lower hybrid ﬁelds in this region.

APPENDIX A: NUMERICAL PROCEDURE FOR SOLVING EQ. (6).

The numerical solution of Eq. (6) is carried out in Fourier space so that Eq. (6) becomes
Eq. (9). Periodic boundary conditions are used in the ζ direction, v(ξ, ζ + L, τ ) = v(ξ, ζ, τ );
therefore, the Fourier spectrum is discrete the spacing between modes being δκ = 2π/L.
We use n points to describe v over a single period L. Transformations between the κ and
ζ spaces are achieved using a discrete Fourier transform. Thus, V is approximated by n
Fourier modes. The ξ coordinate is approximated by a grid whose spacing is δξ. This
equation is solved by splitting each time step δτ into two equal pieces and by approximating
Eq. (9a) in the interval 0

(For simplicity, we describe the solution only for the ﬁrst time step. The extension beyond
this is obvious.)

In each half time step this equation is a partial diﬀerential equation in only two inde-
pendent variables. During the ﬁrst half time step, κ is merely a parameter and we have a
simple linear wave equation to solve. We approximate V ′
2 δτ ) as given by Eq.
(A1) by shifting V (τ = 0) over C = c δτ /δξ grid positions. This step is exact if C is an
integer. Normally, this is not the case and in that event we interpolate between neighboring

grid points. We use linear interpolation on the quantities

During the second half time step we have to solve the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation
at each position ξ. The method is similar to that used in Ref. 7 to solve the steady-state
equation (13). The dispersive term is treated exactly and the nonlinear term is treated with
a second-order Runge–Kutta scheme. Thus, V (τ = δτ ) is approximated by

The accuracy of the numerical integration is checked using the momentum- and energy-
conservation laws. Speciﬁcally, the time integrals of Eqs. (11) and (12) are numerically
computed. These are divided by the total momentum input into the plasma (at ξ = ξ0) and
by the total energy injected into the plasma (both at ξ = ξ0, κ > 0 and at ξ = ξ1, κ < 0) to
provide two measures of the accuracy of the numerical integration, ∆

the solution obtained using the coarser grid until about τ = 1.5. Thereafter, the solutions
diverged from each other. This is to be expected in a system which exhibits turbulent
solutions because the solution is typically very sensitive to the initial conditions. Numerical
errors, which have an eﬀect similar to changing the initial conditions slightly, can therefore
lead to large changes in the solution. However, although the detailed solution is diﬀerent
after τ = 1.5 in these two cases, the general character of the solution is the same. Thus,
the output spectrum for the case with the ﬁner grid spacing shows the same features as the
spectrum given in Fig. 7.

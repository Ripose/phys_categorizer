Abstract

An ubiquitous property of plasmas is the so-called Debye shielding of the electrostatic potential.

Important aspects of Debye screening concern, in particular, the investigation of non-linear charge

screening eﬀects taking place in strongly-coupled plasmas, that imply a reduction of the eﬀective

charge characterizing the Debye-H¨uckel potential. These eﬀects are particularly relevant in dusty

plasmas which are characterized by high-Z particles. The investigation of the eﬀective interactions

of these particles has attracted interest in recent years especially for numerical simulations. In this

work we intend to analyze the consistency of the traditional mathematical model for the Debye

screening. In particular, we intend to prove that the 3D Poisson equation involved in the DH model

does not admit strong solutions. For this purpose a modiﬁed model is proposed which takes into

account the eﬀect of local plasma sheath (i.e., the local domain near test particles where the plasma

must be considered discrete). Basic consequences of the model are discussed, which concern the

asymptotic properties of the solutions determined both for weakly and strongly coupled plasmas.

As an application the charge screening eﬀect in strongly coupled plasmas is investigated and an

explicit expression of the eﬀective charge for the asymptotic DH potential is determined.

INTRODUCTION

A basic aspect of plasma physics is the so-called Debye shielding of the electrostatic po-

tential. This consists in the property of plasmas (or electrolytes [1]), either quasi-neutral

or non-neutral, to shield the electrostatic ﬁeld produced by charged particles (to be also

denoted as test particles) immersed in the same system. This result has fundamental con-

sequences on plasma phenomenology, since it actually limits the range of static Coulomb

interactions inside the Debye sphere, i.e., at a distance ρ ≤ λD from the test particle, λD

being the Debye length. As usual here λD ≡

fact, when both the particles and the plasma are assumed non-relativistic, small-amplitude,

stationary (or slowly time- and space-varying), electrostatic perturbations generated by iso-

lated test particles, result eﬀectively shielded in the external domain, i.e., at distances larger

than the Debye length λD. The renewed interest in this problem [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] is

particularly related to dusty plasmas or colloidal suspensions which are characterized by

the presence of a large fraction of highly charged particles (grains), i.e., having an electric

charge Zde with |Zd| ≫ 1.

In this work we intend to analyze the consistency of the traditional mathematical model

for the so-called Debye screening problem (DSP) originally formulated by Debye and H¨uckel

(DH model [1]). In particular, we intend to prove that the 3D Poisson equation involved

in the DH model does not admit physically acceptable solutions, i.e., solutions which are

provided by ordinary functions and are at least continuous in the domain of existence, i.e.,

are so-called classical (or strong) solutions. For this purpose a modiﬁed model is proposed

which takes into account the eﬀect of local plasma sheath (i.e., the local domain near test

particles where the plasma must be considered discrete). Basic consequences of the model

are discussed, which concern the asymptotic properties of the solutions determined both for

weakly and strongly-coupled plasmas.

Despite previous attempts to construct approximate or exact solutions to the DH model

[10, 11, 12], the related mathematical model appears incomplete and can be shown to be

physically unacceptable, due to the neglect of the local plasma sheath. In fact, it is obvious

that suﬃciently close to the point-particle the so-called weak-ﬁeld approximation is violated

2

making the DH model invalid [8]. In the past [13] it was pointed out that in such a case

the test particle does not produce any electric ﬁeld, but only complete charge neutralization

by the plasma, thus producing a Debye length which eﬀectively vanishes. Other objections

concerned the asserted indeterminacy of the solution for x = 0 due to its divergence in the

same point [14]. These issues were later addressed in a more general context [15], including

the 2D case where complete neutralization cannot be achieved. To recover the correct

physical picture the eﬀect of local plasma sheath must be included. Nevertheless, for suitably

dense plasmas or in the case of plasma species characterized by very high electric charges

(high-Z), such as dusty plasmas, the weak-ﬁeld approximation may be locally violated.

This circumstance, when the eﬀect of ﬁnite local plasma sheath is included, occurs if the

normalized electrostatic potential

Φ(ρ) results of order unit or larger on the boundary of the

plasma sheath (produced by at least one of the s plasma species), namely for ρ = ρos.

b

It is well-known that, in general, the Debye eﬀect occurs provided suitable physical as-

sumptions are introduced. In particular, the plasma must be assumed appropriately close to

kinetic Maxwellian equilibrium, in which each particle species is described by a Maxwellian

kinetic distribution function carrying ﬁnite ﬂuid ﬁelds [deﬁned respectively by the number

density, temperature and ﬂow velocity (N, T, V)]. In the absence of test particles these ﬂuid

ﬁelds must be assumed slowly varying in a suitable sense, or constant, both with respect

to position (r) and time (t).

In this regard it is important to remark that the appropriate

treatment of the plasma sheath surrounding each test particle is essential also for the va-

lidity of the mathematical model for the Debye screening problem, i.e., for the existence of

classical solutions of the Debye screening problem, which do not exist when letting xo = 0

[8].

Another signiﬁcant aspect concerns the issue of the absorption of plasma particles by the

test particle, which eﬀectively modiﬁes the local charge density of the background plasma

species [16, 17, 18]. Since the particle capture mechanism is a manifestly charge-dependent

and velocity-dependent phenomenon (in particular it depends on the angular momentum of

the incoming particle), it is obvious that in principle it can produce deviations from local

Maxwellian equilibrium [19, 20]. However, this phenomenon is expected to become relevant

only if the radii of the test particle and of the surrounding plasma sheath (ρp and ρo) are

comparable, i.e., ρp/ρo ∼ 1. Instead, is results negligible when ρp/ρo ≪ 1. Since dusty and

colloidal plasmas are characterized by typical grain size ρp smaller than 10−4 − 10−5 cm and

3

radius of plasma sheath ρo of the order of 10−2 − 10−3 cm, these eﬀects will be considered

negligible.

Goal of this work is the analysis of DSP and the deﬁnition of a suitably modiﬁed math-

ematical model to take into account the eﬀect of local plasma sheaths in quasi-neutral

plasmas. In particular, in Sec. 2 a modiﬁed Debye screening problem (modiﬁed DSP) is

presented. In Sec. 3 the basic mathematical result is presented which concerns the non-

existence of classical solutions of DSP. The proof is reached by noting that DSP can be

obtained as limit problem obtained from the modiﬁed DSP. Basic feature of the approach

is the representation of the Poisson equation in integral form. This permits to analyze the

asymptotic properties of the solutions of the modiﬁed problem in the limit xos → 0+. It is

found, that the limit solution of the modiﬁed DSP for xos → 0+ is a distribution which van-

ishes identically for all ρ > 0 and is discontinuous in ρ = 0. Hence, the limit function

Φ(x) is

not an strong solution of the DSP equation. This is therefore a characteristic property of the

b

DH model. In particular, as a basic consequence, the eﬀective charge of the DH asymptotic

solution c vanishes identically in such a limit and results independent of the charge of the

test particle.

II. THE MODIFIED DSP

The traditional formulation of the DSP, based on the Debye-H¨uckel model [1] regards

the test particles as point-like and having a spherically-symmetric charge distribution while

ignoring the eﬀect of local plasma sheath. This implies, from the physical standpoint,

to neglect the discrete nature of the plasma. Here we shall consider a modiﬁed modiﬁed

Debye-H¨uckel model, based on the introduction of the notion of local plasma sheath [8].

In the sequel we shall consider for simplicity of notation the case of a two species-plasma,

formed by electrons and Hydrogen ions, having an unique plasma sheath. Thus, we shall

assume that the test particle is represented by a spherically symmetric charge of radius

ρp. For a particle in which ρp < ρo the plasma sheath is represented by the spherical shell

centered at the position (center) of the test particle for which ρp ≤ ρ < ρo, in which the

plasma charge density (except for the presence of the test particle) results negligible. In the

sequel we can also let in particular ρp = 0 (point-like test particle) or ρp = ρo (ﬁnite-size

test particle). The customary DH model is thus recovered letting ρp = 0 and taking the

4

limit ρo → 0 (or in dimensionless variables, requiring xp ≡ ρp/λD = 0 and xo ≡ ρo/λD

→ 0). Denoting

Φxo(x) the solution of the Poisson equation, here we intend to determine
its asymptotic properties in the limit xo → 0+, while also letting xp = 0 (see Lemma). As a

b

consequence and in agreement with [13, 15], in such a case it follows that the limit function

limxo→0+

Φxo(x) ≡

Φ(x) vanishes identically for x > 0, i.e., limxo→0+

formally obtained by letting xo = 0 in the previous equations [in particular Eq.(6)]. This

B. THEOREM - Non-existence of classical solutions of DSP

In the functional class

C (2)({0}) the DSP problem deﬁned by Eqs.((6)and the boundary

conditions indicated above [Eqs.(BC-1 b)(BC-2 b)] does not admit strong solutions.

b

PROOF

In fact, ﬁrst, we notice that the limit function

lim
xo→0+

Φxo(x) ≡

Φ(x),

b

b

(22)

is manifestly a solution of the DSP equation which satisﬁes the required boundary conditions

(4,refBC-2 b). On the other hand, due to the Lemma, this solution is discontinuous in x = xo

and results a distribution. Hence it is not a strong (classical) solution of the modiﬁed DSP

problem.

8

The basic implication of the Lemma and the theorem is that the DSP equation, provided

by the DH model, must be regarded as physically unacceptable, since it does not admit strong

solutions. In this regard it should be noted that, as a basic principle, physically acceptable

of solutions of ordinary (or partial) diﬀerential equations characterizing the classical theory

of ﬁelds must be suitably smooth strong solutions. The modiﬁed Debye screening problem

here deﬁned, instead, exhibits smooth strong solutions and therefore appears, from this

viewpoint, consistent.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The essential implication of the present result is that the customary mathematical model

used for the investigation of the Debye screening problem is incorrect. The correct mathe-

matical model requires, in fact, the treatment of the local plasma sheath, for which a simple

model is provided by Eq.(6). Important physical consequences follow. These concern the

correct estimate of the Debye screening eﬀect, which occurs close to the local plasma sheath

and, particularly, for highly-charged test particles immersed in strongly-coupled plasmas.

In fact, the modiﬁed DSP can be used to obtain asymptotic estimates for the eﬀective di-

mensionless charge c(xo, Γ) carried by the DH potential in strongly-coupled plasmas [9].

The resulting charge screening eﬀect appears produced by non-linear eﬀects in the Poisson

equation. As a consequence, outside the Debye sphere (i.e., for x > 1) the DH potential

generated by highly charged test particles in strongly-coupled plasmas results strongly re-

duced with respect to the theoretical value observed in the corresponding weakly-coupled

systems.

Abstract

We experimentally demonstrate optical control of ﬁlamentation that occurs during propagation

of intense, ultrashort laser pulses through crystals like barium ﬂuoride and sapphire. Control is

exercised by rotating the plane of polarization of the incident laser radiation and is demonstrated

by directly visualizing ﬁlamentation in the bulk via six-photon absorption-induced ﬂuorescence

and, concomitantly, by probing the spectral and spatial properties of white light that is generated.

Filamentation is a spectacular nonlinear process that occurs when ultrashort pulses of

intense light propagate through optical media.

Its importance stems from the fact that

optical energy is precisely localized within a ﬁlament. The ability to localize optical energy

in bulk media opens tantalizing possibilities in areas like micromachining and laser surgery.

Filamentation is also important in the macroscopic domain: in air it has been used to con-

trol natural processes like lightening [1] and its study has been shown to be of utility in

remote sensing [2] and in light detection and ranging [3]. An important ramiﬁcation of the

light-matter interaction in condensed media is that the localization of optical energy may

make possible localized modiﬁcation of material properties like refractive index. This would

open up diverse applications, like three-dimensional material modiﬁcation and fabrication

within bulk materials without surface damage; the feasibility of “optically fabricating” pho-

tonic devices like resonators, beam-shapers, interferometers and ampliﬁers has already been

demonstrated [4]. Periodic arrays of nanostructures have been reported in materials like

fused silica [5]. Light-induced microexplosions within crystals have aﬀorded applications in

emerging areas like nanophotonics and plasmonics [6]. Such microexplosions arise from the

plasma that is created when a small volume of the irradiated material (typically ∼0.1 µm3)
absorbs energy from a femtosecond laser pulse of intensity ∼1014 W cm−2. The resulting

pressure (which can be in the TPa range) generates shock and refraction waves which, in

turn, create nanovoids [6].

From a fundamental viewpoint, understanding the propagation of ultrashort light pulses

in bulk media is complicated as both the temporal and spatial proﬁles of the incident pulse

are altered due to linear and nonlinear eﬀects like group velocity dispersion (GVD), lin-

ear diﬀraction, self-phase modulation (SPM), self-focusing, multiphoton ionization (MPI),

plasma defocusing and self steepening [7]. Filamentation and white light generation are two

facets of propagation eﬀects. White light generation is a manifestation of the dynamics due

to which additional frequency components are added to the incident spectrum. Recent work

[8] has shown that SPM is responsible for generating spectral broadening that is symmetric

around the incident wavelength; at higher powers, other mechanisms like self-steepening and

free-electron generation due to multiphoton excitation generate blue-side frequency compo-

nents, resulting in asymmetric broadening. The physics governing ﬁlament formation in

transparent media is yet to be fully understood. Currently, two broad modeling approaches

are in vogue. One describes a ﬁlament as a soliton-like, self-guided beam wherein ﬁlamenta-

2

tion dynamics are governed by competing processes like the optical Kerr eﬀect (that results

in self-focusing of the incident light, thereby increasing its intensity) and multiphoton exci-

tation (that generates electrons, creating a low-density plasma that, in turn, defocuses the

beam) [9]. The alternative approach [10] visualizes ﬁlamentation in terms of optical energy

being continuously absorbed and regenerated by subsequent focusing of diﬀerent time slices

of the incident laser pulse.

Can some measure of control be exercised over ﬁlamentation dynamics? An answer in

the aﬃrmative would be of obvious importance, and constitutes the subject of this Letter.

Introducing a periodic mesh creates periodic amplitude modulation of the transverse beam

proﬁle that leads to deterministic multiple ﬁlaments in liquids [11]. Organization of regular

ﬁlamentation patterns in air has been demonstrated by imposing strong ﬁeld gradients or

phase distortions in the input beam proﬁle [12], with a deformable mirror [13] or using a

double lens set-up [14].

Increasing the ellipticity of the input beam decreases the power

that is required for multiple ﬁlamentation to occur [15]. For more than 30 years it has been

believed that ﬁlamentation is initiated by random noise that breaks the axial symmetry of

the incident beam [16]. Recent work has demonstrated that noise, by itself, does not play

a signiﬁcant role in the ﬁlamentation dynamics [17] and that deterministic vectorial eﬀects,

like polarization, may be of importance. We report here polarization-dependent propagation

of ultrashort laser pulses in crystals like BaF2 and sapphire. We have monitored the ﬁla-

mentation dynamics by imaging the ﬂuorescence signal obtained upon six-photon absorption

of incident laser light in the case of barium ﬂuoride crystals. Such visualization yields di-

rect evidence that polarization enables us to readily exercise spatial control of ﬁlamentation

within the crystal. Polarization control is also demonstrated by concomitantly monitoring

the spatial and spectral properties of white light that is generated.

We used a Ti-sapphire laser yielding 36 fs pulses (820 nm wavelength) at 1 kHz repetition

rate. We used incident powers of 10-300 µJ, corresponding to 10-1000 times the critical power

for self-focusing. A λ/2 plate controlled the polarization angle of the light incident on each

crystal. A 30 cm lens was used for loose focusing of the incident light. Crystal lengths were

3 mm for sapphire and 15 mm for BaF2. The white light produced was imaged by a CCD

camera and characterized by a ﬁber-coupled spectrometer (spanning the 400-1100 nm range).

Filamentation was imaged using a digital camera and was analyzed using ImageJ software.

Our crystals were randomly oriented and we rotated each around the light propagation axis

3

so as to maximize the generation of white light. This deﬁned the axis around which our λ/2

plate was rotated.

The BaF2 crystal aﬀords the possibility of directly visualizing the self-focusing/defocusing

events in the ﬁlamentation process. This is due to six-photon absorption-induced emission

(see the blue color ﬁlaments in Fig. 1). We recall that the band gap of BaF2 is 9.1 eV

and the incident photon energy is 1.5 eV. The images shown in Fig. 1 vividly demonstrate

that the localization of laser energy within the crystal is amenable to ready spatial control:

we spatially translate the ﬁlaments within the crystal by rotating the polarization vector,

keeping the incident power constant. We quantify the polarization-controlled spatial motion

in terms of zof , the distance from the entrance face of the crystal beyond which we observe

the 6PA-induced emission; this is a robust indicator of the the ﬁlament-start position. zof

has contributions from physical focusing by the external lens as well as from self-focusing

due to n2, the intensity-dependent nonlinear refractive index of BaF2. We ﬁxed the position

of the external lens and rotated the λ/2 plate. For data depicted in Fig. 1, the distance

between the lens and crystal was 27 cm and the geometrical focus of the lens was located

outside the crystal. With the λ/2 plate at 0o, zof =3.5 mm (vertical white line in Fig. 1). As

the incident polarization angle rotates there is gradual spatial translation of the ﬁlament-

start position. At 45o the ﬁlament-start position lies well within the crystal, with zof ∼5.9
mm. The value of zof reverts to its original 3.5 mm when the λ/2 plate is at 90o. The overall

change in zof is signiﬁcantly large, as much as 16% of the crystal length.

Can the physical shift of zof be rationalized within the context of existing knowledge? To

probe this, we take recourse to methods used in related numerical studies of light-induced

damage in bulk media wherein zof has been related to experimental parameters [18] like

focal length, size of the beam, the distance between the lens and the entrance face of the

crystal, the incident laser power and Pcr, the critical power for self focusing which, for

isotropic materials, is (3.77λ2)/(8 πnon2). We note that Pcr depends inversely on n2 which
contributes to the net refractive index of a material: n = no + n2|E|2, where n0 is the linear

refractive index. n2 is further related to the material’s third-order susceptibility tensor: n2
= (12π/no)χ(3). In case of cubic crystals like BaF2 with space-group symmetry m3m, the
eﬀective value of χ(3) is [19]:

χ(3)(θ) = 3χ(3)

where θ is the incident polarization angle. As θ changes, the eﬀective value of χ(3) also

changes and this, in turn, alters n2. The n2 value along the e-direction depends on the prop-

agation direction while along the o-direction is independent of the direction of propagation.

Thus, Pcr is direction dependent. In order to account for the observed shifts in zof , for ﬁxed

incident power, the value of Pcr would be required to change sixfold! This is clearly an
unrealistic proposition. We calculate that the change in n2 for BaF2 is only 0.43×10−16 cm2
W as θ changes by 45o, resulting in only a 130% change in Pcr. Other factors are clearly at

play and need to be identiﬁed and explored.

Nonlinear absorption eﬀects will not aﬀect the beam power at the onset of ﬁlamenta-

tion because these will set in only after suﬃcient intensity has been attained. Indeed, the

beam power may actually decrease with propagation due to GVD-induced pulse broadening.

However, this eﬀect does not signiﬁcantly broaden the pulse as zof changes from 3.5 mm to

5.9 mm. Other factors that we have considered include refractive index modiﬁcation, color

center generation, and induced birefringence. The loose focusing employed in our experi-

ments rules out the possibility of modifying refractive index and generating color centers;

melting [20] is also ruled out. However, we note that loose focusing might well give rise to

cross-polarized wave generation wherein a single input wave is partly converted to a wave

that is polarized perpendicular to the input plane polarization due to degenerate four wave

mixing. Such a process has recently been shown to occur with high eﬃciency in BaF2 [21]

and may lead to variation in the critical power for self-focusing, subsequently changing the

onset of ﬁlamentation that is observed in Fig. 1.

For uniaxial crystals like sapphire, the relation for eﬀective χ(3) is considerably more

complicated as there is now a direction-dependence for e-rays but not for o-rays [22]. The

value of Pcr will vary accordingly. In sapphire, where ﬁlamentation was not visualized due

to the absence of six-photon-absorption-induced emission, we use white light spectra as the

diagnostic. White light spectra from sapphire (see Fig. 2a) have two components: one due

to SPM that arises from the Kerr nonlinearity (symmetric about the incident wavelength)

and an asymmetric component that arises from MPI-induced free electron generation. The

latter contribution is on the blue side of the spectrum and in all our measurements we

saw a polarization-dependent change in this blue-side component. The Kerr nonlinearity

that we observe depends, as noted above, on n2 and χ(3). The latter is a tensor with 81

components. Depending on crystal type and symmetry the tensor may have many non-zero

5

components contributing to the eﬀective χ(3) which will result in change in the value of

n2. Other experiments on isotropic materials have shown that at high intensities there are

deviations from isotropy due to induced birefringence [23]: the induced birefringence makes

any isotropic material behave like a uniaxial crystal.

We also made simultaneous measurements of polarization-dependent white light spectra

BaF2 (Fig. 2b). The 820 nm light was blocked in this case; only the white light was

recorded. Symmetric and asymmetric components are clearly visible. Recent studies have

explored variations in the eﬃciency of white light production and of its spectral content

as a function of incident laser energy [8] but, to our knowledge, studies of how the overall

shape of the spectra change as a function of polarization angle have not been reported. Data

depicted in Fig. 2c show that there is a major polarization-dependent change in the white

light spectral distribution, speciﬁcally a reduction in the spectral width as the incident laser

polarization nears 45o. As the blue part of the spectrum is predominantly due to plasma

eﬀects (free electron generation by MPI [8]), the reduction in width sensitively maps the

lessening of eﬀective laser intensity within the medium which is driven by alterations in

self-focusing conditions that are a consequence of changes in local refractive index. Over

and above measurement of spectra, it is also instructive to directly visualize the white light

pattern. Results are shown in Fig. 3 for BaF2 irradiated at diﬀerent polarization angles that

demonstrate another manifestation of ﬁlament translation. When the ﬁlament-start is close

to the crystal entrance the white light spot is large. As the half-wave plate is rotated, the

ﬁlament-start position moves inside the crystal, reducing the white spot in the far ﬁeld. We

observed more than a two-fold reduction in the white light spot size when the polarization

angle was rotated by 45o. At 0o the central white light zone is surrounded by concentric rings

called conical emission; the rings depend on SPM in the radial direction. As the polarization

angle is changed the ring contrast degrades and the spatial extent of the conical emission

is reduced:

in the radial direction only those frequencies that satisfy the phase matching

condition form concentric rings. The diameter of the central white light spot is polarization

dependent, showing a minimum at 45o. Similar results were observed for sapphire. We

note that self-induced polarization in isotropic media has also been recently reported by

Midorikawa and coworkers [24].

To place our polarization-dependent control results in perspective, we note that it has

been possible to achieve a measure of control on ﬁlament morphology in air by forcing

6

aberrations in the incident light beam and by means of diaphragms [12, 25]. Mysyrowicz

and coworkers [12] have shown that by varying the laser power the self-focusing distance in

air can be altered. We also made measurements at various incident powers; Figure 4 shows

how the onset of ﬁlamentation depends on laser power. At relatively low power we see a

single ﬁlament whose start position lies well inside the crystal (4.6 mm from the front face).

As the power increases, the ﬁlament-start position (zof ) moves nearer the entrance face of

the crystal. The most noteworthy feature is that in order to eﬀect a change in ﬁlament-start

position of ∼3 mm, as much as a 5-fold increase in power is required. The superiority of

our simple polarization method of controlling the position of the ﬁlament-start position is

clearly demonstrated. Our ﬁndings have diverse ramiﬁcations in applied areas and in the

basic sciences, particularly from the viewpoint of material modiﬁcation in the bulk.

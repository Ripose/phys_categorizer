Abstract

We propose a theoretical Hugoniot obtained by combining results for the equation of state (EOS)

from the Direct Path Integral Monte Carlo technique (DPIMC) and those from Reaction Ensemble

Monte Carlo (REMC) simulations. The main idea of such proposal is based on the fact that DPMIC

provides ﬁrst-principle results for a wide range of densities and temperatures including the region

of partially ionized plasmas. On the other hand, for lower temperatures where the formation of

molecules becomes dominant, DPIMC simulations become cumbersome and ineﬃcient. For this

region it is possible to use accurate REMC simulations where bound states (molecules) are treated

on the Born-Oppenheimer level using a binding potential calculated by Kolos and Wolniewicz. The

remaining interaction is then reduced to the scattering between neutral particles which is reliably

treated classically applying eﬀective potentials. The resulting Hugoniot is located between the

experimental values of Knudson et al. [1] and Collins et al. [2].

The H-plasma is a very important and interesting many particle system. Hydrogen is the

simplest and at the same time the most abundant element in the universe. Due to its high

relevance for modern astrophysics, inertial conﬁnement fusion and fundamental understand-

ing of condensed matter, hydrogen continues to be actively studied both, experimentally

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and theoretically [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. At high temperatures and

pressures, the hydrogen behavior is deﬁned by the interaction between free electrons and

protons (plasma state). With decreasing temperature, the contribution of bound states such

as atoms and molecules to the EOS of hydrogen becomes of increasing importance, which

at low temperatures completely deﬁne the hydrogen properties. Furthermore, as pointed

out in many papers (Norman and Starostin [15], Ebeling et al. [16], Haronska et al. [17],

Saumon and Chabrier [18]) there are strong theoretical arguments for a phase transition

between two plasma phases. This issue which is of importance, for example, for models of

Jovian planets is still actively debated. Among other important questions we mention the

high-pressure compressibility, details of the pressure ionization and dissociation.

For this reason, in the last decades considerable experimental and theoretical investi-

gations were carried out to accurately determine the EOS of hydrogen at high pressures.

Experimentally, the EOS for this region can be obtained using shock-wave techniques. The

results of these experiments are usually discussed in form of an Hugoniot

where the speciﬁc internal energy E at a state with the density ρ and the pressure p is

connected to the initial conditions with the density ρ0, the pressure p0 and the internal

energy E0.

One of the well established experimental techniques for the creation of shock waves uses

gas gun devices. With gas gun experiments, Nellis et al. [3] reached maximum pressures of 20

GPa and temperatures of 7000 K. More advanced techniques, the laser-driven experiments

used by Collins et al.

[2] and Da Silva et al.

[4], allow to reach pressures up to 300

GPa. At such pressures, as expected, hydrogen transforms from a molecular to a metallic

state [5]. The results of laser-driven experiments have shown an unusual high compression

ρ/ρ0 = 6 of deuterium, which deviates signiﬁcantly from a maximum compression of ρ/ρ0 =

4.4 obtained within the SESAME EOS [19]. However, the experiments of Knudson et al.

[1] which used magnetically driven ﬂyer techniques (Z-pinch) do not support such high

compressibilities and are close to those of SESAME [19] and Restricted Path Integral Monte

Carlo (RPIMC) [7] results. The reason for this discrepancy of the two experiments is not

yet completely understood and requires more detailed study [20], including independent

theoretical investigations which is the aim of this paper.

It is also necessary to mention

other important experimental techniques such as the convergent geometry technique [6].

The experimental point obtained by Belov et al. [6] within this technique is located between
the results of laser − driven and magnetically driven ﬂyer experiments.

An Hugoniot can be also determined theoretically from the equation of state. This enables

us to compare diﬀerent theoretical approaches and computer simulations with experimental

results, which cover a large region in the phase diagram of hydrogen. They start at tem-
peratures of about 20 K and at a density of ρ0 = 0.171 g/cm3, which corresponds to the

liquid state, and go up to temperatures and densities where only free electrons and nuclei

exist. To our knowledge, there is no theory or computer simulation which rigorously and

consistently describes the complete region of the EOS achievable by experiments. For ex-

ample, the linear mixing model (LM) of Ross [21] rather well predicts the behavior of the

laser driven experiments; however it is a semi–empirical theory which interpolates between

molecular and metallic states of hydrogen.

Further, the region of completely and partially ionized hydrogen can be described ana-

lytically using the methods of quantum statistics [16, 22, 23]. In such methods, an EOS is

obtained from a fugacity expansion (ACTEX) [23] and modiﬁed fugacity expansions which

3

are upgraded by means of quantum–ﬁeld theoretical methods (leading to dynamical screen-

ing, self energy and lowering of the ionization energy [16, 22]). In the latter case it is useful

to condense the results in form of Pad´e approximations [24], (from Debye to Gellman–

Brueckner). Of course, the EOS following from these theories cannot reproduce the Hugo-

niot over the full range of density and pressure. It gives only the asymptotic behavior at

higher temperatures. The typical behavior of the analytical theory [24] is shown in Fig. 1.

It coincides only asymptotically with the ab initio RPIMC calculations and, with decreasing

temperature, deviates considerably from those results. The Hugoniot calculated within the

ACTEX theory which is not shown here exhibits a similar behavior [23].

The main reason for the failure of the analytical theories is obvious. As we mentioned al-
ready, for lower temperatures, the neutral particles, i.e., H-atoms and H2−molecules, become

increasingly important, giving rise to a strongly coupled dense gas or liquid. Under such

conditions it is necessary to invoke the methods of the theory of liquids. The simplest theory

for this region is the fugacity expansion of the EOS up to the second virial coeﬃcient [25].

This theory is applicable only for low densities and cannot correctly describe the molecular

dissociation which is an important process occurring during shock wave experiments. For

moderate densities, the ﬂuid variational theory (FVT), proposed by Ross et al. [26], can be

applied. This theory was further developed by Juranek and Redmer [12] to many component

Deuterium Density [g/cm³]

FIG. 1: Experimental and theoretical results for the deuterium Hugoniot

systems, where molecular dissociation occurs. The eﬀective interaction potentials [26, 27]

between components used within FVT achieve good agreement with experimental gas gun

data of Nellis et al. [3], Fig. 1.

A powerful tool for the investigation of the hydrogen EOS is ab initio computer simulation.

Quantum molecular dynamics simulations, based on a density functional theory, are usually

applied to investigate the atomic and molecular region [8, 13] but have diﬃculties to describe

the partially ionized plasma. The wave packet molecular dynamics also covers the region of

the fully ionized plasma [9] but yields unexpectedly high compressibilties. In this work we

will not discuss these methods in detail and refer to the work cited.

The Path Integral Monte Carlo method is another ﬁrst principle method which is well

suited for the investigation of the EOS of hydrogen over a wide parameter range. Except

for the problem of the Fermi statistics, it is an exact solution of the many-body quantum

problem for a ﬁnite system in thermodynamic equilibrium. The treatment of the “sign

problem” makes the main diﬀerence between the RPIMC method used by Ceperley and

Militzer [7] and the Direct Path Integral Monte Carlo (DPIMC) method used by Filinov et

al. [10, 11] and others. This problem is beyond the present paper, here we restrict ourselves

to the discussion of the DPIMC method.

The idea of DPIMC is the well known: any thermodynamic property of a two-component

plasma with Ne electrons and Np protons at a temperature T and volume V is deﬁned by

the partition function Z(Ne, Np, V, T ):

Z(Ne, Np, V, T ) =

dq dr ρ(q, r, σ; T ),

where q (r) comprises the coordinates of the protons (electrons), σ stands for the spin of

the electrons, and ρ is the density matrix of the system. Taking into account the electron

spin and the Fermi statistics (antisymmetrization), the density matrix is expressed by a

path integral [28] where all electrons are represented by fermionic loops with a number of

intermediate coordinates (beads). In our simulations, we used an eﬀective quantum pair po-

tential, which is ﬁnite at zero distance [29]. This potential was obtained by Kelbg as a result

of a ﬁrst–order perturbation theory. The simulation has been performed at temperatures of
104 K and higher in a wide range of particle densities. Under these conditions the exchange

eﬀects for protons are negligible. In the present calculations, we used an improved treatment

of the electron exchange, i.e., we took into account the exchange interaction of electrons from

neighbor Monte Carlo cells, namely ﬁrst from the nearest neighbor cells (33 − 1), then from
the next neighbors (53 −1) and so on. The calculated thermodynamic properties of hydrogen

allowed us to compute the shock Hugoniot of deuterium using Eq. (3)

H = E − E0 − 1
2

(p + p0)(V − V0) = 0.

(3)

Following the work [7] we chose p0 = 0, ρ0 = 0.171 g/cm3, E0 = −15.886 eV per atom and
computed the pressure pi and the energy Ei at a given constant temperature T (from 104 K
to 106 K) and three values of the volume Vi = 1/ρi corresponding to rs =1.7, 1.86, and 2,
where rs = ¯r/aB, ¯r = (3/4πnp)1/3, np is the particle density, aB– Bohr radius. The results of

the calculations are presented in Table 1. Substituting the obtained values pi, Ei and Vi into

the Hugoniot we determine the volume range V1, V2 where the function H(p, V, E) changes

its sign. The value of the density at the Hugoniot is calculated by linear interpolation of

the function H between V1 and V2. The values of the pressure and of the total energy are

shown in the Table 1 only for those density values between which the value of the density

lies on the Hugoniot at a given temperature. The values of density and pressure on the

Hugoniot are placed in the last two columns of Table 1. and are polotted together with

selected theoretical and experimental data in Fig. 1. The lowest temperature included in

this ﬁgure for the DPIMC is 15625 K.

In order to correctly describe the quantum mechanics of the formation of molecules at

temperatures lower than 10000 K, it is necessary to take many beads. In this region, DPIMC

calculations become very time consuming and the convergence is poor. The natural proposal

which appears for this region is to use the asymptotic property of the path integral which,

for heavy particles, goes over into the classical partition function. For such systems, the

classical Monte Carlo scheme can be applied. An advanced version of the classical Monte

Carlo scheme is the reaction ensemble Monte Carlo technique (REMC) [30]. This method

incorporates the quantum mechanical description of bound states, while the scattering states

Deuterium Density [g/cm³]

FIG. 2: Results for the combined Hugoniot

are treated classically. As was shown by Bezkrovniy et al.

[14], REMC describes the low

temperature region very well, and yields good agreement with the gas gun experiments by

Nellis et al.

[3] Fig. 1. In these simulations the energy levels for the molecular partition

functions of hydrogen and deuterium are obtained by solving the Schr¨odinger equation with

the potential calculated by Kolos and Wolniewicz [31]. On the basis of the REMC, results

are obtained much easier as compared to those from molecular dynamics based on density

functional theory; see Bonev et al. [13] and Fig. 2. Our REMC data are presented in Table

2.

In order to get a uniﬁed picture combining DPIMC and REMC, we use the fact that

REMC turns out to be the limiting case of DPIMC at low temperatures, where hydrogen

consists only of atoms and molecules. Therefore, it is obvious to use the asymptotic results

of both methods to construct an Hugoniot which can be applied in the entire range of

compression. For the construction of the combined Hugoniot we carefully analyzed the

region where the Hugoniots produced by the two methods can be connected to each other.

As we can see from Fig. 1 the Hugoniot calculated within DPIMC ends at the point 15625 K.

At this temperature, the largest contribution to the EOS are given by molecular states. As

natural continuation of the DPIMC Hugoniot, we take the point of 15000 K produced by

REMC. We want to stress here that these two methods are completely independent and

7

no interpolation procedure is used. Just two points at 15625 K of DPIMC and 15000 K

of REMC are connected to each other. The ﬁnal Hugoniot is plotted in Fig. 2 and shows

a maximum compressibility of approximately 4.75 as compared to the initial deuterium

density.

The results of MHD plane shock waves with inﬁnite electrical conductivity are generalized for
a plasma with a ﬁnite conductivity. We derive the adiabatic curves that describe the evolution of
the shocked gas as well as the change in the entropy density. For a parallel shock (i.e., in which
the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the normal to the shock front) we ﬁnd an expression for the shock
thickness which is a function of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld and of the ﬁnite electrical conductivity of
the plasma. We give numerical estimates of the physical parameters for which the shock thickness is
of the order of, or greater than, the mean free path of the plasma particles in a strongly magnetized
plasma.

I. INTRODUCTION

Previously, shock waves in plasmas, both relativistic and non-relativistic, were studied assuming ideal MHD, [1–3].
Although this theory is suitable for studying most astrophysical shock waves, such as those in hot rariﬁed astrophysical
plasmas, where the electrical conductivity is extremely high and the magnetic ﬁeld is weak, it is interesting to study
the eﬀect of the simplest dissipative process in non-ideal MHD, that due to a ﬁnite value of the electrical conductivity
σ. We generalize here the results for planar shock waves to non-ideal, non-relativistic MHD. The junction conditions
that must be satisﬁed across a shock wave in a non-ideal plasma are given in Sec. II. We then derive the adiabatic
curve with corrections due to σ and ﬁnd the corresponding change in the entropy density across the shock. We
perform this analysis for an oblique shock (i.e., in which ~B is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the normal to the
shock surface) as well as for a parallel one (i.e., in which ~B is parallel to the normal to the shock surface). In Sec. III,
we ﬁnd a closed expression for the shock thickness for a parallel shock in a strongly magnetized plasma, and estimate
its value for some physical situations. Our conclusions are discussed in Sec. IV.

II. JUNCTION CONDITIONS AND ADIABATIC CURVE

For non ideal MHD, the ﬂuxes of mass, energy, and momentum are given by Eqs. (1-4), respectively, [1,4],

the transition surface. We then have the hydrodynamical junction conditions, [4],

[ρvxnx] = 0

[qxnx] = 0

[Πixnx] = 0

[Bn] = 0,

where i is x (t) [normal (tangential) to the shock surface] and [] means the diﬀerence between the value of the
corresponding quantities far upstream (which we denote by subscript “1”) and the value at some point in the shock
(no subscript). It is also assumed that both far upstream and far downstream, all gradients vanish (i.e., the ﬁelds and
ﬂows are uniform).

In the MHD case that we are considering, Eqs. (5), (6), and (7) must be suplemented with the electromagnetic
junction conditions, i.e., that the normal component of the magnetic ﬁeld and the tangential component of the electric
ﬁeld must be constant across the shock surface:

C. Perpendicular shock

Shock waves in a plasma permeated with a magnetic ﬁeld show several features, of which the most well known is
related to the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the shock plane. Although perpendicular shocks can be
considered to be a special case of oblique shocks, it is interesting to write the simpliﬁed expressions for the junction
conditions explicitly, and re-derive the adiabatic curve and the entropy density change for this case.

There is now only one term that depends on the dissipative properties of the plasma, while for the oblique case, we
had two such terms. The missing term is related to the normal component of the magnetic ﬁeld.

III. THICKNESS OF THE SHOCK WAVE

The calculation of a general expression for the shock thickness is very diﬃcult, if not impossible. However for a
perpendicular shock it is possible to calculate the shock thickness exactly. We then have Bn = 0, ~vt = 0 and consider
a coordinate system in which the only non-zero component of the magnetic ﬁeld is By = B, [1]. In this case, the
equation ~

From the ﬁrst two equations, it is easy to see that the ratio B/ρ
β satisﬁes the equation ∂β/∂t + vx∂β/∂x = 0 or
dβ/dt = 0 [1]. Hence, if the ﬂuid is homogeneous at some initial instant, so that β = const., then it will remain so at
all subsequent times. Substituting B = ρβ in the third equation, we obtain

≡

Thus, the magnetic ﬁeld has been eliminated from the equations. The equation for the velocity ﬁeld, Eq. (32), is
formally identical to that for the ideal ﬂuid case, provided we deﬁne the ‘true pressure’ as p∗ = p + β2ρ2/8π. We can
now proceed to evaluate the thickness, following Ref. [4]. We write

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we extended the results of shock waves treated in ideal MHD to the non-ideal case, in which the
electrical conductivity is ﬁnite. We considered Ohm’s law in its simplest form, [5], but took into account phenomeno-
logically (through the parameter γ) plasma eﬀects that can modify the classical Spitzer electrical conductivity (e.g.,

1We know that in accretion disks, protostars, galactic nuclei and neutron X-ray sources, for example, the plasma cannot
have ideal Spitzer values for the conductivity and viscosity in order to obtain the observed accretion rates. Therefore it is
generally assumed that these quantities are highly anomalous (due to turbulence, for example). Another example where the
assumption of anomalous resistivity is used is in the treatment of solar ﬂares, which are generally assumed to be due to magnetic
reconnection. If ideal Spitzer values are used for the plasma in solar ﬂares, reconnection times are ∼ 106 times longer than the
observed time scales for the ﬂares. In general, plasmas near shocks are expected to be highly anomalous (i.e., γ ≪ 1) due to
turbulence.
−6, the magnetic ﬁeld range is 102 G ≤ B0y ≤ 1010 G. A magnetic ﬁeld B ≥ 102 G can be easily be present at the

center of a massive star. The magnetic ﬁeld increases in the collapse of the core of a massive star to B ≥ 106 (for the collapse
to a white dwarf) and to B ≥ 109 (for the collapse to a neutron star). Thus, at the center of a massive star, we may expect
that the magnetic ﬁeld varie from 102 G to 1010 G during the collapse of its core and the start of a supernova explosion.

turbulence). The expressions for the adiabatic curve and the entropy density change across the shock were generalized.
Finally, we derived the expression for the shock thickness for a ﬁnite conductivity in the case of a parallel shock in
strongly magnetized plasmas. The conditions that the ambient magnetic ﬁeld must satisfy for the thickness to be
of the order of the particle mean free path were estimated. We found that these conditions can be fulﬁlled for the
plasma expected in the origin of a supernova explosion, [6,7]. Extensions of the results presented in this paper, using
a more general Ohm’s law, as well as to relativistic shocks, are presently under investigation.

V. APPENDIX

In this appendix, we sketch the derivation of the expression for L∗ , the damping length used to calculate the shock
thickness. Neglecting the displacement current (which is a good approximation in non-relativistic electrodynamics),
the evolution equation for the magnetic ﬁeld in a medium with electrical conductivity σ moving with a velocity ~v is

Adding the equations for the ﬂuid, which we assume has neither viscosity nor thermal conduction, we have

Let us assume that B = ~B0 +~b, ρ = ρ0 + δρ, p = p0 + δp, and ~v = δ~v. Replacing these terms in the above equations,
keeping only terms to ﬁrst order in the perturbations, expanding the density in powers of the perturbation in the
pressure (i.e., δρ = δp/v2
s δp2, where vs is the sound velocity of the medium) and taking the Fourier
∂2ρ/∂p2
transform of the equations, we obtain

Using Eqs. (49) and (50) we obtain the compatibility relationship

from which we obtain

From Eq. (52), the phase velocity is a complex number if σ is ﬁnite. Rewriting uA in terms of ω, we obtain the
dispersion relationship:

We take the plus sign in eq. (52) since the frequency is a positive quantity. The fact that the imaginary part is
non-linear in k means that the Alfven waves are damped and dissipated as a function of k. For σ
we recover
the known dispersion relationship for ideal MHD.

Assuming that the second term in the square root in Eq. (53) is much smaller than unity, the group velocity is

When the electrical conductivity is inﬁnite, we recover the known ideal MHD result, vAI = B0x/2√πρ0.

This relationship can be inverted to obtain ω = ω (k) . However, for our purposes, it suﬃces to consider the dissipative
terms as a correction to the ideal dispersion relationship,

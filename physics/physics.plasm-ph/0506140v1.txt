Abstract

The equilibrium of an axisymmetric magnetically conﬁned plasma with anisotropic
resistivity and toroidal ﬂow is investigated in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD). The stationary states are determined by an elliptic diﬀerential equation for the
poloidal magnetic ﬂux function ψ, a Bernoulli equation for the pressure and two relations
for the resistivity components ηk and η⊥ parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.
The ﬂow can aﬀect the equilibrium properties solely in the presence of toroidicity because
in the limit of inﬁnite aspect ratio the axial velocity does not appear in the equilibrium
equations. The equilibrium characteristics of a tokamak with rectangular cross-section
are studied by means of eigenfunctions in connection with exact solutions for the cases of
“compressible” ﬂows with constant temperature, T (ψ), but varying density on magnetic
surfaces and incompressible ones with constant density, ̺(ψ), but varying temperature
thereon. Those eigenfunctions can describe either single or multiple toroidal conﬁgura-
In the former case the equilibrium has the following characteristics: (i) the ηk-

and η⊥-proﬁles on the poloidal cross-section having a minimum close to the magnetic
axis, taking large values on the boundary and satisfying the relation η⊥ > ηk are roughly
collisional (ii) the electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces possesses two local
extrema within the plasma and vanishes on the boundary and (iii) the toroidal current
density is peaked close to the magnetic axis and vanishes on the boundary. The impact
of the ﬂow and the aspect ratio on the aforementioned quantities is evaluated for both
“compressible” and incompressible ﬂows.

1. Introduction

Understanding the equilibrium properties of a magnetically conﬁned plasma is one
of the key issues in the fusion research. The majority of equilibrium studies up to date
concern plasmas of zero electrical resistivity and have been based on the Grad-Schl¨uter-
Shafranov equation which describes the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria of ax-
isymmetric plasmas. Additional physical input in terms of resistivity and plasma ﬂow,
however, are very important. In addition to its apparent role for Ohmic heating, the im-
portance of resistivity is connected to the operation of a steady-state fusion reactor which
will involve time scales much longer than the resistive-MHD one. Also an attractive fea-
ture of such a reactor would be operation under minimum sources of mass, momentum
and energy. Sheared ﬂow plays a key role in the formation of both edge transport barriers
(L-H transition) [1, 2] and internal transport barriers [3]-[6] in tokamaks. This ﬂow is
associated with sheared electric ﬁeld proﬁles [7]-[10] with signiﬁcant amplitudes in the
barrier region. Another pertinent quantity is the safety factor [11]-[13] closely related to
the toroidal current density.

Theoretically it was proved long time ago [14] that axisymmetric resistive MHD equi-
libria with scalar resistivity uniform on magnetic surfaces are not compatible with the
Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation and the poloidal current density should vanish. The
nonexistence of axisymmetric equilibria with constant resistivity was also suggested in
[15, 16]. To examine whether these undesirable properties can be removed by in-
Refs.
cluding, in addition to resistivity in Ohm’s law, ﬂow and viscosity terms in the momentum
equation is a formidable task, which should be preceded by a step by step thorough inves-
tigation of particular cases possibly introducing additional physical input each time. In
this respect two of the authors studied axisymmetric equilibria with scalar resistivity and
ﬂow purely toroidal [17] and parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld B [18] and found that the ﬂows
considered can not remove the aforementioned inconsistencies. Non-vanishing poloidal
currents are possible in steady states with parallel ﬂows in the presence of anisotropy,
i.e. for diﬀerent resistivity components ηk and η⊥ parallel and perpendicular to B [19];
however, in this case neither ηk nor η⊥ can be uniform on magnetic surfaces. The sole
external source in Refs. [17]-[19] is the toroidal current loop voltage. Resistive equilibria
in a similar spirit of minimum external sources were investigated in Refs. [15, 16] and [20]-
[24]. The particular ﬂow directions considered in Refs. [17]-[19] are not inconsistent with
Pﬁsrch-Schl¨uter diﬀusion in the sense that the equilibrium solutions constructed therein
neither exclude nor can be included in possible Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter-diﬀusion solutions (hav-
ing velocity components perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces). Also, it is reminded
that the pertinent pioneering study [25] does not include external sources of current and
neglects the ﬂow term in the momentum equation.

In this report we extend the studies [17]-[19] to equilibria with toroidal ﬂows and
anisotropic resistivity. There are two advantageous features of toroidal ﬂows compared
with parallel ones: (i) they are associated with electric ﬁelds Ep perpendicular to the
magnetic surfaces and (ii) as we will show exact solutions with magnetic surfaces of uni-
form temperature, T = T (ψ), are possible. Equilibria with incompressible ﬂows having
uniform density but varying temperature on magnetic surfaces will also be examined. In
this respect it is noted that although purely toroidal axisymmetric ﬂows are inherently
incompressible because of symmetry, T (ψ)-equilibria can be regarded as “compressible”
in the sense that the density varies on magnetic surfaces. In both cases the study can be

2

carried out analytically up to the construction of exact solutions. In particular equilibrium
eigenstates of a tokamak with rectangular cross-section will be derived in connection with
exact solutions describing either single toroidal or multitoroidal conﬁgurations. Further-
more for single toroidal eigenstates we will study the characteristics of the conductivity
components σk and σ⊥, the electric ﬁeld Ep, and the toroidal current density Jφ along
with the impact of the ﬂow on these quantities. This impact will be examined by varying
a sound-speed Mach number M0 for “compressible” ﬂows and a parameter A relating
to the ̺- and Ep- proﬁles and their variation perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces for
incompressible ones. In particular the uniformity of σk and σ⊥ on magnetic surfaces will
be examined independently of solutions. Also it will be shown that the impact of the ﬂow
on the equilibrium is crucially related to the toroidicity.

An outline of the report is as follows. Reduced equilibrium equations involving ψ, the
pressure and the resistivity components are derived in Sec. 2. Tokamak eigenstates are
constructed in Sec. 3 for both “compressible” and incompressible ﬂows. The equilibrium
characteristics of σ⊥, σk, Ep, and Jφ along with the impact of the ﬂow and the aspect
ratio on them is the subject of Sec. 4. The possible role of the ﬂow shear is also brieﬂy
discussed therein. The conclusions are summarized in Sec. 5.

2. Equilibrium equations

In this section we shall derive reduced equilibrium equations for an axisymmetric
magnetically conﬁned plasma with anisotropic resistivity and toroidal ﬂow. The procedure
is uniﬁed in the sense that relevant energy equations or equations of state are not adopted
from the beginning; they will speciﬁed when necessary later.

The starting equations in standard notation and convenient units are the following:

∇ · (̺v) = 0,
̺(v · ∇)v = J × B − ∇P,
∇ × E = 0,
∇ × B = J,
∇ · B = 0,
E + v × B = η · J = ηk · Jk + η⊥J⊥,

where

η⊥ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

is the resistivity tensor; the indices k and ⊥ indicate directions parallel and perpendicular
to B; accordingly Jk = (J · b)b, J⊥ = b×(J×b) = J−Jk with b = B/B. The procedure
to follow is based on identifying some integrals as ﬂux functions, i.e. functions constant
on magnetic surfaces, and reducing the set of Eqs. (1-6) by projecting the momentum
equation (2) and Ohm’s law (6) along the toroidal direction, the poloidal one (or parallel to
B when convenient), and perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces. Important information
is also drawn from an integral form of (6) [Eq. (13) below].

In cylindrical coordinates (R, φ, z) with z corresponding to the axis of symmetry the
equilibrium quantities for the case under consideration do not depend on the toroidal

3

angle φ; the toroidal velocity and the divergence-free magnetic ﬁeld and current density
can be expressed, with the aid of Amp´ere’s law, in terms of the functions K(R, z), ψ(R, z)
and I(R, z) as:

where ψ labels the magnetic surfaces and ∆∗ ≡ R2 ∇ ·(∇/R2).

By projecting the momentum equation along the toroidal direction one obtains

̺v = K∇φ,
B = I∇φ + ∇φ × ∇ψ,
J = ∆∗ψ∇φ − ∇φ × ∇I,

∇φ · (∇ψ × ∇I) = 0,

(9)
(10)
(11)

(12)

which implies that I = I(ψ). Therefor, unlike the case of parallel ﬂow [19], the current
surfaces coincide with the magnetic ones irrespective of equation of state. Integration of
(6) along a contour c deﬁned by the cut of an arbitrary current surface with the poloidal
plane yields the equation:

E · dl +

(v × B) · dl =

(η · J) · dl,

(13)

Zc

Zc

Zc

where dl = ∇φ × ∇ψ/|∇φ × ∇ψ| is the unit vector along the poloidal direction. Since in
equilibrium it holds that ∂B/∂t = 0, the ﬁrst integral on the left-hand side of (13) vanishes
by Stoke’s theorem. Also the second integral vanishes due to the toroidal direction of the
ﬂow. For the integral on the right-hand side to vanish the integrand must necessarily do
so because the Jpol-lines are closed, nested and ∇ · J = 0; therefor it should hold locally

(η · J) · dl = (η · J)pol = 0.

(14)

For isotropic resistivity, η⊥ = ηk, (14) implies that the poloidal current density must
vanish. In the presence of anisotropy, however, non-vanishing poloidal current densities
are possible as expected because the toroidal electric ﬁeld can drive a current in the
poloidal direction. The rest of the report concerns equilibria with non-vanishing poloidal
current densities.

Expressing the electric ﬁeld on the poloidal cross-section in terms of the electrostatic
potential, Ep = −∇Φ, the component of local Ohm’s law (6) in the poloidal direction on
account of (14) yields

∇φ · (∇Φ × ∇ψ) = 0.

(15)

which implies that Φ = Φ(ψ); therefor Ep is perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces. The
total electric ﬁeld is given by

E = Vc∇φ + Ep = Vc∇φ − Φ′∇ψ,

where 2πVc is the constant toroidal loop voltage and the prime denotes derivative with
respect to ψ. Subsequently, the component of (6) along ∇ψ yields

Owing to the axisymmetry and the toroidal direction of the ﬂow these equations do not
contain the resistivity and are identical in form with the respective ideal-MHD equations.
In order to reduce Eqs. (22) and (23) further an energy equation or equation of state
is necessary. Owing to the large heat conduction along B, isothermal magnetic surfaces,
T = T (ψ), is an appropriate equation of state for fusion plasmas. In this case employing
the ideal gas law, P = λ̺T , integration of (22) yields

P = Ps(ψ) exp

An alternative equation of state is incompressibility:

Consequently, (1) implies that the density is a ﬂux function, ̺ = ̺(ψ), and therefor one
can ﬁnd along the same lines the following incompressible equations for P and ψ:

Eq. (28) is identical with a particular form of the axisymmetric equilibrium equation for
incompressible ﬂow of arbitrary direction obtained in Ref. [27] for ideal plasmas.

Once Eqs. (25) and (28) are solved for ψ the resistivity components can be determined
by (20) and (21). In general inspection of Eqs. (20) and (21) implies, like the case of
parallel ﬂows [19], that neither η⊥ nor ηk can be uniform on magnetic surfaces; indeed
solving (25) and (28) for ∆⋆ψ and substituting into (20) and (21), one can see that η⊥
and ηk depend, in addition to ψ, explicitly on R (and on |∇ψ|2 as concerns ηk). However
as we will see in Sec. 4, η⊥ and ηk can be collisional-like, viz. they can have a minimum
close to the magnetic axis, take very large values on the boundary and it holds that
η⊥ > ηk. Reasons for temperature deviations on magnetic surfaces, which can result to
non uniformity of ηk and η⊥ thereon, are discussed in Sec. III of Ref. [19].

Summarizing this section, the MHD equilibrium states of an axisymmetric plasma
with anisotropic resistivity and toroidal ﬂow is governed by an elliptic diﬀerential equa-
tion for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function [Eq. (25) for “compressible” ﬂow and (28) for
incompressible one], a Bernoulli relation for the pressure and self-consistent expressions
for the resistivities ηk and η⊥. Both Eqs. (25) and (28) contain four ﬂux-functions, three
out of which, i.e. Ps, I and ω, are common. The fourth function is T for the “compressible
equation” and ̺ for the incompressible one. For vanishing ﬂow (25) and (28) reduce to
the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation.

3. Exact solutions

Linearized forms of Eqs. (25) and (28) in connection with appropriate assignments of
the free ﬂux functions they contain can be solved analytically. In the present study we
will employ exact solutions as follows.

“Compressible” ﬂow
The ansatz used to linearize Eq. (25) is [28] [29]

Here, I0/R is the toroidal vacuum ﬁeld, the parameter I1 describes the magnetic properties
of the plasma; P0, γ, and M0 are a pressure parameter, the ratio of speciﬁc heats, and
the Mach number with respect to the sound-speed at a reference point (z = 0, R = R0)
with R0 to be speciﬁed later. Note that the toroidal current density proﬁle can vanish on
the plasma boundary via (10).

Eq. (25) then has a separable solution, R(R)Z(z), when the constant of separation is
equal to R0I1. For conﬁgurations symmetric with respect to mid-plane z = 0 this solution

The third of equations (31) on account of (17) indicates that A is associated with the
density and electric ﬁeld proﬁles and their variation (shear) perpendicular to the magnetic
surfaces [(̺ω2)′ 6= 0]. The polarity of Ep and the aforementioned shear permits A to take
either positive or negative values. This is a remarkable diﬀerence as compared with the
choice (29) which is shearless [(ω2/λT )′ = 0]. Also, note that, unlike M0 in (29), A is
dimensional.

In connection with solutions (30) and (32) we are interested in the steady states of a
tokamak the plasma of which is bounded by a conducting wall of rectangular cross-section,
as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, we assume that the plasma boundary coincides with the
outermost magnetic surface. Thus, the magnetic ﬁeld is tangential to and the pressure P
must vanish on the boundary [31]; accordingly, the function ψ should satisfy the following
boundary conditions

and

ψ(y±) = 0

ψ(x±) = 0,

where y± = ±a/R0 and x± = 1 ± b/R0. The equilibrium becomes then a boundary-value
problem. Eigenstates can be determined by imposing conditions (33) and (34) directly to
solutions (30) and (32). Speciﬁcally, (33) applied to the z-dependent part of the solutions
yields the eigenvalues

for the quantity I1 which is related to the poloidal current function I(ψ). The respective
eigenfunctions are associated with conﬁgurations possessing ℓ magnetic axes parallel to
the axis of symmetry. Condition (34) is pertinent to the R-dependent part of the solution.
Owing to the ﬂow this part contains the parameter M0 in the “compressible” case and
A in the incompressible one in addition to the pressure parameter P0. Thus, condition
(34) can determine ﬂow eigenvalues depending on the parameter P0 which remains free,
F n(P0) (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .) with F standing for either M0 or A, or vice versa, pressure
eigenvalues P n
0 (F ) with F being free. The other parameters C1 and C2 contained in (30)
and (32) are adapted to normalize ψ with respect to the magnetic axis and to satisfy the
boundary condition (34) respectively. The eigenfunctions in association with F n(P0) [or
P n
0 (F )] are connected to conﬁgurations having n magnetic axes perpendicular to the axis
of symmetry. Therefor the total equilibrium eigenfunctions ψℓn = Zℓ(z)Rn(R) describe
multitoroidal conﬁgurations having ℓ × n magnetic axes.

On the basis of the above solutions one can evaluate the impact of the ﬂow on the
resistivity components η⊥ [Eq. (20)] and ηk [Eq. (21)], the electric ﬁeld perpendicular
to the magnetic surfaces [Ep = − ∇Φ = −Φ′∇ψ] and the toroidal current density Jφ
[Eq. (11)] for both “compressible” and incompressible ﬂows. It is emphasized that this
impact is crucially related to the toroidicity because in the limit of inﬁnite aspect ratio
the equilibrium equations do not contain the axial velocity regardless of“compressibility”.
Indeed, for a cylindrical plasma of arbitrary cross-section the equations respective to (22)
and (23) read

For ideal plasmas Eqs. (36) and (37) follow respectively from (16) and (17) of Ref [32]
for vanishing poloidal velocity (F ′ = 0 therein). Therefor the ﬂow may have an impact
on equilibrium only in the presence of toroidicity. Also, note that the pressure becomes a
ﬂux-function. Because of the importance of toroidicity the impact of the aspect ratio on

equilibrium in addition to that of the ﬂow will be evaluated in the next section.

4. Impact of the ﬂow and aspect ratio on equilibrium

The quantities to be examined are the conductivity components σ⊥ = 1/η⊥ and σk =
1/ηk, the electric ﬁeld Ep and the toroidal current density Jφ. Both “compressible” and
incompressible ﬂows will be studied for single toroidal conﬁgurations. The study is based
on the eigenfunction ψ11 which for “compressible” ﬂow is shown in Fig. 2 and will be made
by varying the ﬂow parameters M0 and A for “compressible” and incompressible ﬂows
respectively. For any value of M0 or A the respective lowest eigenvalue of the pressure

parameter P0 will be calculated numerically. The variation of M0 and A will correspond to
the same range of eigenvalues of P0. Speciﬁcally, for aspect ratio α = 3 the ﬂow parameters
M0 and A will be ranged in the intervals [0.1, 0.7] and [-0.001, -0.01] respectively. For
α = 2 the respective intervals will be [0.1, 1] and [-0.001, -0.08] unless stated otherwise.
Variation of the ﬂow parameters in connection with the results to be presented will refer
to these intervals. The tokamak scaling Bp ≈ 0.1Bφ will be used for the calculations.
Also, we should make the following clariﬁcation:
it occurs that solutions (30) and (32)
oscillate as the ﬂow parameters are varied, viz. for any given point (R, z) these solutions
considered as functions ψ(M0)and ψ(A) take successively larger and lower values as M0
and A are varied monotonically. This, would give rise to an oscillatory behavior to all

physical quantities which is physically unjustiﬁable. For the conductivity components
this can be seen in Fig. 3. To avoid this diﬃculty the solutions will be normalized in

center (x = 1).

such a way that the poloidal magnetic ﬂux on the magnetic axis is unity irrespective of
ﬂow. This is accomplished by choosing appropriately the parameter C1 for each value
of M0 or A [C1(M0) for “compressible” ﬂow and C1(A) for “incompressible” one]. Also,
solutions (30) and (32) have a strong parametric dependence on the ﬂow parameters
[note the exponential dependence of (30) on M 2
0 ]. Consequently, this dependence results
in large quantitative changes in the physical quantities for large M0 (M0 ≈ 1) or small
A (A ≈ −0.01) which most probably overestimate the impact of ﬂow. In addition, it is
noted that except for the conductivity components an increase of M0 has qualitatively the
same impact on the physical quantities to be examined with that caused by a decrease of
A.

The results concerning the characteristics of the quantities σ⊥, σk, Ep, and Jφ and the

impact of the ﬂow and α on them are as follows.

Conductivity components

1. For both “compressible” and incompressible ﬂows the proﬁles of σ⊥ and σk on the

Figure 5: The ﬁgure shows the decrease of the maximum of σ⊥ and σk but the insensitivity
of its position for incompressible ﬂow as the parameter A decreases.

Fig. 4 for “compressible” ﬂows and in Fig. 5 for incompressible ones. For vanishing
ﬂow and α = 3 one ﬁnds ∆σ/σk ≡ (σk − σ⊥)/σk = 0.2122; for the reversed-ﬁeld-
pinch scaling, Bφ ≈ Bp, the value of (σk − σ⊥)/σk becomes double, i.e. 0.4244. Also,
for α = 3 increase of M0 from 0.1 to 0.7 results in a percentage decrease of ∆σ by
4% while decrease of A from -0.001 to -0.01 leads to an increase of ∆σ by 3.4%.

2. The maximum of the proﬁles takes larger values as M0 increases and lower values as
A decreases. For α = 3 increase of M0 (from 0.1 to 0.7) leads to percentage increases
of σ⊥ and σk by 9% and 7% respectively. For incompressible ﬂows the respective
decreases are 73% and 67% (for α = 3 and decrease of A from -0.001 to -0.01).

3. The position of the maximum is shifted outwards from the axis of symmetry as M0
increases and is nearly insensitive to the variation of A [33] (see Figs. 4 and 5). For
example for α = 3 the position of the maximum of σ⊥ changes from 1.119 to 1.151
(when M0 varies from 0.1 to 0.7).

• the larger the decrease of ∆σ = σk − σ⊥ as M0 increases;

• the smaller the increase of ∆σ as A decreases;

• the larger the increase of the σ⊥- and σk-maximum as M0 increases;

• the smaller the decrease of the σ⊥- and σk-maximum as A decreases;

• the larger the shift of the position of σ⊥- and σk-maximum as M0 increases.

Those conclusions become evident if the following results for α = 2 are compared
with those presented above for α = 3:

• the decrease of ∆σ for compressible ﬂow is 13%;

• the increase of ∆σ for incompressible ﬂow is 1%. The respective variation of

A in this case is [-0.001,-0.01] (see [34]);

• the increase of the conductivity maximum values for “compressible” ﬂows are

44% (σ⊥) and 27% (σk);

43.7% (σ⊥) and 63% (σk);

1.228 to 1.33.

• the decrease of the conductivity maximum values for incompressible ﬂows are

• the position of the maximum of σ⊥ for “compressible” ﬂow is displaced from

The “compressibility” dependent impact of the ﬂow on σ⊥, σk and ∆σ may relate to the
ﬂow shear of the incompressible solution (32) while the “compressible” solution (30) is
shearless.

Electric ﬁeld

Prescribing the rotation frequency ω(ψ) by

ω = ω0ψn,

(38)

where n is a shaping parameter, the electric ﬁeld, Ep = −Φ′∇ψ, with the help of (17)
becomes

(39)

Ep = −ω0ψn∇ψ.
The proﬁle of Ep on the poloidal cross-section possesses two local extrema within the
plasma volume one on the left-hand-side and the other on the right-hand-side of the
magnetic axis with opposite sign, which means that the electric ﬁled has diﬀerent polarity
[as can also be deduced from Eq. (39)] and is similar to ones observed in equilibria with
internal transport barriers. The proﬁle |Er|, on the mid-plane y = 0 is shown in Fig. 6.
Increase of M0 or decrease of A leads to an increase of both local maximum values of |Er|
with the one outwards more than the one inwards the magnetic axis and to a displacement
of their positions outwards. For “compressible” ﬂows this is shown in (Fig. 6). For α = 3
the maximum values of |Er| increase by 4% for “compressible” ﬂow (increase of M0 from
0.1 to 0.7) and 5.6% for incompressible one (decrease of A from -0.001 to -0.01). The
lower α the larger the increase of the maxima and the displacement of their positions
outwards. As an example, for α = 2 the increase of the maximum |Er| becomes as large

|Er| take lower values but the proﬁle of Er becomes steeper and more localized (Fig. 7);

tion of the ﬂow parameters is stronger as the aspect ratio becomes smaller. In particular
for α = 3 and α = 2 the maximum value of the current density increases by 8% and
35.5% respectively for compressible ﬂows (increase of M0). The respective increases for
incompressible ﬂows (decrease of A) are 5.6% and 18%.

5. Conclusions

In this report we have investigated the MHD equilibrium of an axisymmetric mag-
netically conﬁned plasma with anisotropic resistivity and toroidal ﬂow subjected to the
single external source of toroidal current loop voltage by including the ﬂow term in the
momentum equation. Equilibria of this kind are inherently free of Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter diﬀu-
sion. Also, unlike the case of parallel ﬂows, there is an electric ﬁeld Ep perpendicular to
the magnetic surfaces. The study includes “compressible” ﬂows with varying density but
uniform temperature on magnetic surfaces and incompressible ones with uniform density
but varying temperature thereon. It turns out that the equilibrium states are determined
by an elliptic diﬀerential equation for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function ψ [Eq. (25) for
compressible ﬂows and (28) for incompressible one], a Bernoulli equation for the pressure
[respective Eqs. (24) and (27)] and two relations for the resistivities η⊥ [Eq. (20)] and

14

ηk [Eq. (21)] parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. Owing to axisymmetry
and the toroidal direction of the ﬂow, the equilibrium equations and pressure relations
are identical in form with the respective ideal-MHD ones. The impact of the ﬂow on
equilibrium can be “activated” solely in the presence of toroidicity because the cylindrical
equilibrium equations do not contain the axial velocity.

The equilibrium of a tokamak plasma bounded by a rectangular cross-section has
been studied by means of equilibrium eigenfunctions in connection with exact solutions
for “compressible” and incompressible ﬂows. These eigenfunctions can describe either
single toroidal or multiple toroidal conﬁgurations.
In the former case we have studied
the characteristics of the conductivities σ⊥ and σk, the electric ﬁeld Ep, and the toroidal
current density Jφ as well as how they are aﬀected by the ﬂow. The impact of the ﬂow has
been examined by varying pertinent ﬂow parameters, i.e. a sound-speed Mach number
M0 for the “compressible” ﬂow and a parameter A relating to the density and electric
ﬁeld and their variations perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces for the incompressible
one. For (i) single toroidal conﬁgurations (ii) eigenfunctions normalized so that ψ is
unity on the magnetic axis regardless of ﬂow (a normalization made to avoid physically
unjustiﬁable oscillation of the solutions on the ﬂow parameters) and (iii) variation of
the ﬂow parameters corresponding to the same variation of the lowest eigenvalue for the
pressure parameter P0 we came to the following conclusions:

1. For a toroidal frequency ω(ψ) peaked on the magnetic axis and vanishing on the
boundary [Eq. (38)] the proﬁle of |Ep| on the poloidal cross-section has two maxima
located the one on the left-hand-side and the other on the right-hand-side of the
magnetic axis and it vanishes on the boundary. When the maximum of ω becomes
larger and its proﬁle more localized, the proﬁle of |Ep| becomes as well more localized
though its maxima become smaller.

2. The proﬁle of Jφ is peaked with its maximum close to the magnetic axis and vanishes

on the boundary.

3. Although the conductivity components can not be uniform on magnetic surfaces
(this follows in general by inspection of the equilibrium equations) their proﬁles are
roughly collisional, viz. they have a maximum in the vicinity of the magnetic axis,
vanish on the boundary and it holds, in most of the cases that σk > σ⊥.

4. As M0 increases or A decreases the local maxima of Ep and Jφ take larger values

and their positions are shifted outwards from the axis of symmetry.

5. The impact of the variation of the ﬂow parameters on σ⊥ and σk rely on “compress-
like Ep and Jφ, the maxima of σ⊥ and σk become larger as M0 increases
ibility”:
and their positions are displaced outwards but these maxima become smaller and
their positions are nearly not aﬀected as A decreases. Also, the larger the M0 the
smaller σk − σ⊥ but the smaller A the larger σk − σ⊥.

6. For a given value of M0, the lower the aspect ratio α the smaller the maxima of σk,

σ⊥ and Jφ but the larger the maximum of Ep.

7. For a given value of A, the lower the aspect ratio α the larger the maxima of σk, σ⊥

and Ep but the smaller the maximum of Jφ.

15

8. For increase of M0 or decrease of A (corresponding to the same variation of the
lowest eigenvalue of P0), the lower α the higher the variation of the maxima of Ep
and Jφ and the displacements of their positions outwards. The impact of α on the
conductivities are “compressibility” dependent: the smaller the α (i) the larger the
variation of the maximum of σ⊥, σk and σk − σ⊥ (when M0 increases) but (ii) the
smaller the maximum of σ⊥, σk and σk − σ⊥ (when A decreases).

Qualitatively, except for the conductivity components the impact of the ﬂow on Ep
and Jφ are independent of “compressibility”. The dependence of the results for σ⊥ and
σk on “compressibility” may be due to the fact that the incompressible solution (32) has
ﬁnite ﬂow shear while the ﬂow of the compressible one (30) is shearless. Quantitatively,
for α = 2 and increase of M0 from 0.1 to 0.5 or decrease of A from -0.001 to -0.006
result in percentage variations of all quantities (σk, σ⊥, Ep, and Jφ) less that 10%. Larger
variations of these quantities associated with higher values of M0 or lower values of A, we
have found on the basis of solutions (30) and (32), most probably overestimate the actual
impact of the ﬂow.

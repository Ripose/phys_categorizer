Gibbs statistical mechanics is derived for the Hamiltonian
system coupling self-consistently a wave to N particles. This
identiﬁes Landau damping with a regime where a second or-
der phase transition occurs. For nonequilibrium initial data
with warm particles, a critical initial wave intensity is found :
above it, thermodynamics predicts a ﬁnite wave amplitude in
the limit N
; below it, the equilibrium amplitude van-
ishes. Simulations support these predictions providing new
insight on the long-time nonlinear fate of the wave due to
Landau damping in plasmas.

Landau damping is a striking phenomenon ﬁrst evi-
denced in plasma physics, but also lately in various sys-
tems such as nonlinearly coupled oscillators [1] or neu-
tral rareﬁed gases [2].
In plasma physics, its classical
treatment involves a continuous media analysis through
Vlasov-Poisson equations. It was shown by O’Neil that
(near-)resonant particles play a major role in the time-
asymptotic, generically nonlinear regime experienced by
kinetic systems submitted to Landau damping [3]. This
has been debated recently by several works. In partic-
ular, Isichenko argued for algebraic ﬁnal decay of the
electric ﬁeld in the nonlinear regime [4], under the cru-
cial assumption of an asymptotically vanishing ﬁeld [5],
though in numerical investigations by Manfredi [6] the
electric ﬁeld was seen to damp exponentially in the linear
regime and then to oscillate around a ﬁnite amplitude in-
dicating a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) equilibrium.
Lately, Lancellotti and Dorning [7] have shown that both
types of time-asymptotic states were eligible depending
on initial conditions.

In this Letter we address this issue from a diﬀer-
ent viewpoint and relate both possible time-asymptotic
states (with zero or ﬁnite ﬁeld) to diﬀerent phases in a
phase transition picture. Rather than using the large
number of weakly interacting particles N to express the
dynamics by a kinetic equation for a distribution function
f (x, p), we note that the intrinsic chaos in this dynam-
ics ensures an eﬀective ergodicity allowing a Gibbsian
equilibrium statistical mechanics treatment. This analy-
sis provides further insight on the results of the kinetic
approach.

As real plasmas are made of a ﬁnite number of par-
ticles and as these graininess properties, and notably

the existence of spontaneous emission, are discarded by
their classical vlasovian treatment, a model taking these
properties into account has been derived [8,9]. The ﬁrst
steps in this direction were made by O’Neil et al. [10]
in order to treat the cold beam-plasma instability, and
a Hamiltonian formalism was ﬁrst introduced by Myn-
ick and Kaufman [11]. This Hamiltonian system mod-
els the interaction between M (bulk) Langmuir waves
and N quasiresonant (tail) particles and has already pro-
vided insight into linear Landau growth and damping,
the cold beam-plasma instability [12] and Van Kampen
modes [9]. From the physical viewpoint, this approach
has the advantage to treat the waves as dynamical objects
rather than subordinate phenomena, i.e. excitations of
the bulk plasma. In the kinetic limit N
, the coupled
(many-body) wave-particle dynamics approaches the cor-
responding dynamics generated by the Vlasov equation
over any ﬁnite time interval [13].

For simplicity, we concentrate on the single-mode case
(M = 1), which is paradigmatic to study Landau damp-
ing. Besides, this case is of special interest for devices
such as traveling wave tubes where a single mode can
be selected [14]. For N identical (tail) particles moving
on the interval of length L = 2π with periodic boundary
conditions T := R/(2πZ), with unit mass and charge,
and respectively position xr and momentum pr, inter-
acting with one wave of natural frequency ω0, unit wave
number, phase θ and intensity I, the Hamiltonian reads

The ﬁrst term describes ballistic motion of the particles,
the second the oscillations of the free wave (harmonic
oscillator) and the third couples them; here η is a small
parameter denoting the ratio of the tail density over the
plasma density. The bulk of the plasma is considered
as a linear dielectric supporting plasma waves. The wave
frequency ω0 (which is the plasma frequency ωp) provides
the natural reference time scale, which can be ﬁxed with
no loss of generality. Thus ω−1
0 will be the time unit, so
that the phase velocity of the free wave is also 1.

The self-consistent system can be viewed as a set of
nonlinear oscillators coupled through a mean-ﬁeld, as the
equation of motion for any particle r obtained from (1)
reads

i.e. the equation of a pendulum in the ﬁeld with strength
2ηI/N and angle θ. The wave evolves consistently
with the particles. For this mean-ﬁeld model, the ki-
p
netic vlasovian limit [13] corresponds to taking the limit
N
while the acceleration felt by any particle should
remain ﬁnite. This induces the natural kinetic scaling for
(N ) and gives its kinetic equiv-
the wave intensity I =
alent as the intensive quantity ψ := I/N .

Most importantly, this approach enables an equilib-
rium statistical mechanics treatment, provided the dy-
namics is eﬀectively ergodic. In this Letter we derive the
equilibrium Gibbs predictions for one ﬁeld’s observable,
its intensity I. This study predicts a second-order phase
transition in the regime corresponding to damping. We
exhibit a critical initial ﬁeld intensity, above which par-
ticle trapping induces a ﬁnite ﬁeld amplitude, whereas
below it, in the kinetic limit of an inﬁnite number of par-
ticles, the asymptotic ﬁeld would vanish. These results
complement the dynamical ones [3,7], and our estima-
tions are fully supported by numerical simulations based
on a fourth-order symplectic scheme [15].

The Liouville sub-manifold of the phase space is ﬁxed

relying on the equivalence of ensembles when systems get

Consequently, when σ < ω0, a second order phase transi-

i.e. the suitably normalized intensity of the wave [13].
Above Tc, the intensity of the wave loses its extensivity :
the particles and the wave decouple in the sense that the
wave controls just one among N + 1 degrees of freedom.
On the contrary, for T < Tc, the wave is macroscopic
and large enough to trap particles. When T

exhibits a formal divergence signaling the crossover from
intensive to extensive scaling (8).

Before considering the implications of our results, let
us discuss the conditions under which they hold. The
Gibbs Ansatz assumes that particles explore the avail-
able (x, p) space thanks to the nonintegrability of their
dynamics. For physical applications, it suﬃces that they
explore a ‘large’ part of the (x, p) space ; in our case,
that they be able to wander, say, within a velocity range
of two standard deviations on either side of their aver-
r pr + I = P ensures that
age velocity. The constraint
the kinetic energy contribution to (3) is a Maxwell distri-
ψ, with standard deviation T 1/2
bution centered on σ
for pr. One therefore expects some good mixing prop-
erties, due to a trapping/detrapping mechanism [22], if
T 1/2 is of the order of the velocity width of resonance
(2), namely (ηψ)1/4. This equivalently corresponds to ϕ
being of order 1. In discussing numerical simulations, we
shall note that relaxation towards equilibrium occurs for
initial data roughly realizing this condition.

Now we turn to the manifestation of this phase transi-
tion in the wave-particle dynamics. The problem raised
by Landau damping is an initial value problem (hence
a nonequilibrium one), where a packet of particles, spa-
tially homogeneous with velocities distributed according
to a certain f0(v), interacts with a wave launched with
intensity ψ0 > 0. This determines E/N =
i0/2+ω0ψ0
and σ =
i0 + ψ0. The condition σ < ω0 implies
i0 < ω0, which corresponds typically to a bunch of

resulting critical mean intensity is ψ0c = 5.59

Running simulations for diﬀerent values of ψ0 and N
yields the plot of Fig. 1 for asymptotic values of ψ.
This ﬁgure shows a clear agreement with thermodynam-
ics predictions in the kinetic limit N
for both
quasi-ballistic and trapping regimes. In the critical re-
<
gion where ψ0
∼ ψ0c (dashed lines), one observes strong
metastability eﬀects and critical slowing-down, whereas
additional ﬁnite-N corrections smooth the transition : in
this region, initial ﬁeld intensities are far larger than their
equilibrium averages. Moreover, for the range of ψ0 con-
sidered on Fig. 1, the analytic expression for T happens
to diﬀer only slightly from T0. Therefore the ‘mixing’
condition corresponds to √2ηψ0/T0 being of order 1.

This mixing condition is roughly fulﬁlled for the runs
of Fig. 2 displaying the temporal evolution of ln √ψ and
progress towards equipartition for diﬀerent values of N .
Along these runs, the relative energy variation is less than
10−7. On the inset, after the initial linear Landau
2
damping at the prescribed rate, one observes trapping
oscillations that could suggest the setting up of a BGK
equilibrium. However, on longer times, the sweeping of
the phase space is suﬃcient to drive the system to a far
diﬀerent, ‘high’ temperature, regime where I is no longer

ation times diverging with N . Analogous pathological
have been re-
relaxation properties in the limit N
ported for a similar mean-ﬁeld model [18] in the subcrit-
ical energy domain where chaos is paradoxically shown
to be maximal [18,19].

→ ∞

It is surprising to note the good ergodic behavior of ψ
ψ0c, where no mixing
for the initial domain where ψ0 ≪
can be expected as the system is close to integrability.
Here one recovers the eﬀective linear Landau damping
and ergodicity is ensured dynamically by a perturbative
analysis [9,20].

In the trapping regime, the equilibrium level is quickly
reached as a substantial fraction of particles is liable to
undergo separatrix crossings [22]. Nevertheless ψ0 is lim-
ited by the velocity range chosen for the tail particles
[23]. One checks that the trajectories corresponding to
the velocity borders of our distribution in the Boltzmann
(x, p) space correspond to KAM tori for the eﬀective 1.5
degrees of freedom Hamiltonian dynamics (2) with time
dependent parameters (θ, I) [21].

Finally, denoting by τB0 = (2ηψ0)−1/4 the trapping
time corresponding to the initial mean wave intensity and

the qualitative dynamical threshold drawn (in a non self-
consistent way) by O’Neil [3] separating a regime domi-
nated by trapping (if q < qc) from a regime where linear
predictions are eﬀective (if q > qc). Existing numeri-
cal self-consistent simulations of the damping of a single
wave are limited to the early stage of wave evolution and
would typically infer a larger qc (e.g. qc = 0.77 for a
linear f0(v) in [24]). As clearly accounted for by Fig. 2
and inset (for which q = 0.14) , our new approach relates
this apparent discrepancy to critical slowing-down. Our
intuition is that an algebraic decay of the order param-
eter ψ (in the limits N
) may be a

dynamical signature of the vicinity of critical point, as in
Landau second order phase transitions’ picture. In a pa-
rameter regime q >
∼0.06, Isichenko’s conclusions [4] may
then apply here.

and t

In conclusion, using the self-consistent wave-particle
Hamiltonian (1) to describe this system has revealed a
new phenomenon, the phase transition associated with
the Landau damping regime. This phenomenon eludes
the usual Vlasov-Poisson description, which actually
treats all particles on the same footing, as a Coulomb
system. But the wave-particle interaction is eﬀectively
very diﬀerent for near-resonant particles (trapping time
scale (2ηψ)−1/4 and Landau linear scale
−1) and for
bulk particles (adiabatic or non-resonant averaging time
scales, exponentially longer than resonant ones): our self-
consistent Hamiltonian describes the system on the phys-
ical time scales for the wave evolution [8].

Moreover, our ﬁnite-N approach shows that, in a real
plasma, the wave will never damp completely but will

level due to spontaneous wave emission.

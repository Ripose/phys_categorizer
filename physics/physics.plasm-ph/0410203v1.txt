The linear dispersion relation of a ﬁnite amplitude, parallel, circularly polarized Alfv´en wave in a
relativistic electron-positron plasma is derived. In the nonrelativistic regime, the dispersion relation
has two branches, one electromagnetic wave, with a low frequency cutoﬀ at
p (where
ωp = (4πne
is the electron/positron plasma frequency), and an Alfv´en wave, with high
frequency cutoﬀ at the positron gyrofrequency Ωp. There is only one forward propagating mode
for a given frequency. However, due to relativistic eﬀects, there is no low frequency cutoﬀ for the
electromagnetic branch, and there appears a critical wave number above which the Alfv´en wave
ceases to exist. This critical wave number is given by ckc/Ωp = a/η, where a = ω2
p and η is the
ratio between the Alfv´en wave magnetic ﬁeld amplitude and the background magnetic ﬁeld. In this
case, for each frequency in the Alfv´en branch, two additional forward propagating modes exist with
equal frequency.

A simple numerical example is studied: by numerically solving the coupled system of ﬂuid and
Maxwell equations, normal incidence of a ﬁnite amplitude Alfv´en wave on an interface between two
electron-positron plasmas of diﬀerent densities is considered.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Electron-positron plasmas are diﬀerent from electron-ion plasmas, because in the absence of a mass diﬀerence,
there are no high or low natural frequency scales.[1] Such plasmas are found in pulsar magnetospheres,[2] models of
primitive Universe,[3] active galactic nuclei jets,[4, 5] and laboratory and tokamak plasmas.[6, 7] Relativistic eﬀects
are expected to play an important role in several of these systems. Understanding interactions between waves and
relativistic electron-positron plasmas is relevant to proposed pulsar emission mechanisms [8, 9], and may give insight
into structure formation in the early Universe [7].

Therefore, wave propagation in relativistic electron-positron plasmas has been the subject of many studies, either in
the ﬂuid or the kinetic treatments: linear waves [10, 11], nonlinear waves [12, 13], and nonlinear decays [14, 15, 16, 17].
In this article we deal with an Alfv´en wave propagating along a constant magnetic ﬁeld in a pair plasma. When
fully relativistic eﬀects are considered in the particle motion, the dispersion relation exhibits unique features which, to
our knowledge, have not been discussed before. We then outline the numerical strategies we are currently considering
to examine the consequences of such features.

We assume that the electron-positron plasma is described by the following set of equations:

We assume that a circularly polarized Alfv´en wave propagates along the z-axis, as well as the existence of a constant

magnetic ﬁeld in the same direction, B0 ˆz. The wave electric and magnetic ﬁelds are given by:

Introducing (9) and (10) in the ﬂuid equations, the transverse velocity for each species is obtained as [14]

For a given y, from (17) γj is calculated as a function of x, and then the right hand size of Eq. (16) can be plotted.
This is shown in Fig. 1. Since y is given, we plot the left side of Eq. (16) on the same graph, and the intersection
points of the curves are the roots of the dispersion relation. The curve on the right corresponds to the light wave
branch of the dispersion relation, and the curve on the left corresponds to the Alfv´en branch. It is interesting to note
that when y > yc = a/η the Alfv´en wave ceases to exist.

Thus dispersion relation (16) can be solved. The result is shown in Fig. 2. For η = 0 [Fig. 2(a)], the nonrelativistic
result is recovered. There are two branches, one corresponds to the light wave, with a cutoﬀ at ω/Ωp = √1 + 2a. The

other one is the Alfv´en branch, which has a resonance at the positron gyrofrequency. For η = 0.1 [Fig. 2(b)], however,
the light wave branch has no low frequency cutoﬀ, and the Alfv´en branch stops at yc = a/η. For even higher values
of the wave amplitude η [see Fig. 2(c) for η = 1], the Alfv´en branch exists for a very short wavenumber range. The
Alfv´en branch is also constrained to a shorter frequency range. This can also be seen in Fig. 1. From Eqs. (14)–(16)
it can be shown that the Alfv´en branch in Fig. 1 has a frequency cutoﬀ at the critical frequency

III. OUTLINE OF THE NUMERICAL STUDY

Fig. 2 shows that, for a given frequency ω, the existence of Alfv´en waves and the number of wave modes depend on
the physical parameters of the plasma. This poses a number of new questions. For instance, we could consider the
problem of normal incidence of a plane wave on a density interface. In the usual problem of a light wave in a dielectric
medium, only one mode exists for a given frequency. Given only the boundary conditions that the ﬁelds must satisfy,
it is possible to completely solve the problem and obtain explicit solutions for the ﬁeld amplitude at both sides of the
interface. However, now several modes exist for a given frequency. Moreover, if an Alfv´en wave exists with a given
frequency in one side of the interface, then if the density is small enough on the other side it could not exist. Does it
become an evanescent wave? Is it converted to other modes?

In order to investigate this we are studying the system by means of a ﬂuid simulation, and by direct time integration

of the evolution equations.

rationalized Runge-Kutta method.

Both procedures are under development/testing. A particularly simple problem is that of a pure Alfv´en mode
propagating in a relativistic plasma. Since in a pair plasma there is no harmonic generation, all oscillatory ﬁelds and
velocities are purely transverse. We are currently working to obtain satisfactory results for this problem, in order to
later consider incidence on a normal interface, where longitudinal oscillations may not be neglected.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Propagation of a ﬁnite amplitude Alfv´en wave in an electron-positron plasma has been studied. Full relativistic
eﬀects on the particle velocities in the wave ﬁeld have been considered. The dispersion relation for propagation
along a constant magnetic ﬁeld has been obtained and numerically solved. Several features are diﬀerent to the usual
nonrelativistic result [Fig. 2(a)]. In the nonrelativistic case, there are two branches, an Alfv´en wave and a light wave.
The light wave has a low frequency cutoﬀ at the frequency ω/Ωp = √1 + 2a, and the Alfv´en wave has a high frequency
cutoﬀ at the positron gyrofrequency, ω = Ωp. However, in the relativistic case the light wave branch does not have a
low frequency cutoﬀ. As to the other branch, there are two Alfv´en wave modes for any given frequency, and there is
a high wavenumber cutoﬀ at ckc/Ωp = a/η. Besides, the high frequency cutoﬀ for the Alfv´en wave depends on the
plasma parameters. For large amplitude wave or small plasma density, the Alfv´en branch is constrained to a small
region of frequencies and wavenumbers [see Fig. 2(c)].

We intend to investigate the behavior of the system when a relativistic Alfv´en wave of frequency ω propagates
through a pair plasma, and then ﬁnds a region where plasma parameters are such that such wave cannot propagate.
The existence of more normal modes than in the usual nonrelativistic problem make this a nontrivial matter. As
a ﬁrst example, we are considering the simple problem of normal incidence of an Alfv´en wave on a planar density
discontinuity. Two approaches are being developed, namely a ﬂuid simulation, and time integration of the evolution
equations. Work on this is in progress, and we expect to present results elsewhere.

It is worth noting that for waves in the high-wavenumber end of the Alfv´en branch in Fig. 2, particles have large
Lorentz factors, and therefore synchrotron radiation emission will be important. Thus, the results presented here may
be further modiﬁed when additional eﬀects such like synchrotron loss are taken into account.

The rigorous analytical calculation of the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient is performed for the chaotic motion of a particle in a set
of longitudinal waves with random phases and large ampli-
tudes (∼ A). A ﬁrst step proves the existence of a quasilinear
diﬀusion on a time scale ∼ A−2/3 ln A. A second step uses
this property to extend the result to asymptotic times by in-
troducing the conditional probability distribution of position
and velocity of an orbit at a given time when they are known
at a previous time. The only property of chaos to be used is
the non-conﬁnement of a chaotic orbit in velocity.

I. INTRODUCTION

Many chaotic Hamiltonian systems encountered in
physics display a chaotic diﬀusion and in many cases the
corresponding diﬀusion coeﬃcient is given by a so-called
quasilinear estimate [1–4]. The proof that this estimate
is correct exists for the standard map with large con-
trol parameter [5], but is lacking for other systems with
a spatially smooth force. We provide this proof for the
one-dimensional chaotic motion of a particle in a general
set of waves.

This result strengthens the link between the micro-
scopic deterministic (chaotic) dynamics and the macro-
scopic stochastic motion.
Its extension to the self-
consistent many-body problem is a central problem to
non-equilibrium statistical physics.

This paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce
our model dynamics and stress the core of our argu-
ment. Then we recall the traditional argument deriv-
ing the quasilinear diﬀusion over a time short with re-

A−2/3 (A being a
spect to a characteristic time τspread ∼
typical value of the wave amplitudes) and introduce the
explicit form of the quasilinear diﬀusion coeﬃcient. We
rederive this result within our new approach and take ad-
vantage of a better understanding of the particle motion
to extend the validity of quasilinear diﬀusion to a time
A−2/3 ln A, which is longer than the traditional
scale
scale τspread for A large. Finally, we introduce the con-
ditional probability distribution of position and velocity
of a chaotic orbit at a given time when they are known
at a previous time and, thanks to the non-conﬁnement
of the velocity of the chaotic orbit, we further extend the
quasilinear estimate to asymptotic time scales.

II. DYNAMICAL MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS

We consider the dynamics of a particle in a set of longi-
tudinal waves (e.g. Langmuir waves) with random phases
and large amplitude, as deﬁned by the Hamiltonian

the ϕm’s are

random variables,

where
and the
(Am, km, ωm)’s are prescribed triplets of positive param-
eters. Such a dynamical system has already been studied
in the literature, and for large Am’s the diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient has been found numerically to take on the quasi-
linear value [4,6–9] deﬁned below [10]. The average over
M
1 random phases is central to our
proof, in agreement with the occurrence of uncontrolled
phases in many experiments and with the fact that the
transport in (1) is much less diﬀusion-like if one aver-
ages only over initial conditions (p0, q0) [11]. The large
A limit (dynamically speaking, the limit of strong res-
onance overlap parameter) corresponds to the limit of
continuous spectrum often encountered in physics.

In agreement with most of the literature on quasilin-
ear transport, the analysis is performed here in terms
of quadratic means, and not in terms of the probabil-
ity distribution functions, but we indicate at the end of
this paper how our technique could be used to prove the
gaussianity of such functions.

The equations of motion are

to stay close to the unperturbed orbit q(0)(t) = q0 + p0t,
and let ∆q(t) = q(t)

compute their statistical properties when averaging over
all ϕm’s.

IV. CHAOTIC TRAJECTORY SPREADING

In fact our second approach is much more powerful.
As was pointed out in Ref. [8], ∆± vanishes provided
that the dependence of ∆q over any Nϕ = 2 phases with
all other phases ﬁxed is weak, a condition far less strin-
gent than the previous condition Nϕ = M which led to
t
τspread. Reference [8] estimated the upper bound in
time of the initial quasilinear diﬀusion through numerical
calculations for moderate values of the waves amplitude.
Here we derive such a bound analytically for large enough
amplitudes.

The result of this discussion is that “q(t) depends little
on any given phase over a time τQL”. For M

argument is easily strengthened into “q(t) depends little
on any two given phases over a time τQL”. To this end
(q6m1,6m2(t), p6m1,6m2 (t)) and (δq(t), δp(t)) are deﬁned start-
ing from ϕm1 = ϕm2 = 0, and a third term similar to the
second one adds in the right hand side of (10). The ﬁrst
stage of our iteration procedure now estimates the con-
tribution of both phases ϕm1 and ϕm2 by a term again

As a result, for t

∆± are negligible since q has a small dependence on any

terms may be estimated by expliciting in the argument of
the cosine of (7) the main dependence over ϕm1 and ϕm2
through estimates δΦm1 and δΦm2 of the type kmδqn0 for
both phases, and by expanding to second order in these
δΦ’s. Such estimates hold for t

for asymptotic times. Let pmin = min(vm) and pmax =

[pmin, pmax] the dynamics is chaotic enough for a typi-
cal orbit to be unconﬁned in p within this domain, but
that the time of interest is also smaller than the time for
the orbit to reach the boundaries of the chaotic domain.

VI. CONCLUSION

Thus, with the only assumption on chaos that a chaotic
orbit is unconﬁned in velocity, we prove the quasilinear
character of the diﬀusion for the motion of a particle in
a spectrum of large amplitude longitudinal waves. Our
technique can be adapted to systems with a slow depen-
dence of the quasilinear diﬀusion coeﬃcient on p. As
many Hamiltonian systems may be locally reduced to
case (1) [16], this further extends its range of applicabil-
ity and shows that the universality class of quasilinear
diﬀusion is broad. It also provides insight for the case
where particles and waves are self-consistently coupled
[17].

Higher order moments of ∆p could be computed using
a similar technique. Indeed, preliminary calculations in-
dicate that the use of conditional probabilities should en-
able one to retain after Fourier transforms the same terms
for the moment of order κ as in the case where q(t) is
−1,
weakly dependent on any phase provided that κ

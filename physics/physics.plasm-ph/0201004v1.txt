Abstract

Inclusion of inverse Compton effects in the calculation of deuterium-deuteri-
um burn under the extreme conditions considered by Eliezer et al. [Phys.
Lett. A 243 (1998) 298] are shown to decrease the maximum burn temper-
ature from about 300 keV to only 100–150 keV. This decrease is such that
T + p reaction is not sufﬁcient to replace the
tritium breeding by the DD
small amount of tritium that is initially added to the deuterium plasma in
order to trigger ignition at less than 10 keV.

Simpliﬁed models of thermonuclear burn are well known to lead to ﬁrst order
results that are generally in reasonable agreement with more sophisticated models.
However, the prerequisite for such agreement is that, in the parameter range
under consideration, all physical phenomena that are relevant to this order of
approximation be consistently taken into account.

In a recent Letter, the results of space-time independent calculations of very-
150 keV) thermonuclear burn of a very-high
high temperature (Ti
density (compression of
30’000 times solid density) DD plasma containing a
small initial addition of tritium are presented [1]. From these calculations, the
authors conclude that the initial amount of about 2% of tritium needed to trigger
ignition at less that 10 keV is regenerated by the DD reaction if the burning
temperature is higher that 200 kev.
If this is correct, it would be possible to
conceive DT fusion reactors which would not need external tritium breeding for
their operation.

However, in these calculations, a number of effects and processes which be-
come important at extremely high temperatures and densities seem not to have
been fully taken into account. These phenomena comprise various relativistic and
degeneracy effects, as well as several radiation processes which include inverse
bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung, Compton scattering, etc. Of
these phenomena, the most important is electron energy loss by inverse Comp-
ton scattering. The purpose of this Comment is to show that its inclusion in the
simulation totally changes the main conclusion of Ref. [1].

4 is the radiation energy density and Ne the electron number

time of the bremsstrahlung photons through a thin plasma of radius R is ∆t
R/c.
Therefore, if WB is the bremsstrahlung radiation loss rate, Er
WBR/c. Using
this estimate, it is readily seen that WC > WB for Te > 60 keV in the parameter
range considered in Ref. [1], so that Compton effects cannot be neglected.

To make this statement more quantitative, and in order to calculate how much
of the initial tritium can effectively be regenerated during thermonuclear DD burn,
we have used our simulation program ISRINEX [3] to reproduce the results of
Ref. 1 and to show the consequences of taking radiation effects more fully into
account.

In our program, inverse bremsstrahlung and Compton effects are simulated by
a model attributed to H. Hurwitz. This model was ﬁrst published in [4] and is used
in both small (e.g., [5]) and large (e.g., [6]) simulation programs. However, since
there is some discrepancy in the published literature on the details of this model,
we take this Comment as an opportunity to review it brieﬂy.

Hurwitz’s model is a three-temperature model in which the electron and photon

energy equations are coupled as follows:

The ﬁrst term corresponds to bremsstrahlung effects.

It is obtained by in-
tegrating over frequency the difference between emission by the electrons of
bremsstrahlung radiation and reabsorption of the local radiation ﬁeld (inverse
bremsstrahlung). With the notation of Ref. [7], this is

The second term in (2,3) corresponds to Compton effects as given by (1).
The third term in (3) is the photon energy loss rate which for the purpose of this
Comment is approximated by:

Expression (6) is the maximum possible photon energy loss, so that its use tends
to underestimate the value of Tr and thus the effect of Compton scattering. On the
other hand, expression (7), which gives the correct limit in the case of an inﬁnitely
thin plasma (and which gives results in close agreement with simulations presented
in [4]), tends to minimize radiation losses and therefore to overestimate Compton
effects.

The results of our calculations for the simulation shown in Figs. 2–4 of Ref.
[1] are given in Table 1. The ﬁrst column gives our results when the only radiation
effect included is bremsstrahlung losses, i.e., dEe/dt = WB, as in Ref. [1]. They
are in reasonable agreement with Ref. [1], except possibly for the ﬁnal tritium
content which is only 0.83 instead of slightly more than 1. This may partly be
explained by the fact that in our calculation the maximum ion temperature is only
270 keV instead of about 300 keV. Otherwise, the ratio of tritium content goes
through a minimum at a burn time of about 2 ps, and through a maximum at about
6 ps, as in Fig. 2 of Ref. [1].

The second column corresponds to Hurwitz’s three-temperature model with
inverse bremsstrahlung and radiation losses included according to (4) and (6). The
effects on Ti and Te are small, and the ﬁnal fuel burn-up fraction is unchanged.
However, the maximum radiation temperature, i.e., 17 keV, is large enough to
imply that Compton effects cannot be neglected.

The third column gives our results when both bremsstrahlung and Compton
300
effects are fully included. The maximum ion temperature is only half the
keV found in [1]. Consequently, Ti is not large enough to breed enough tritium to
replace the initial tritium content. The ﬁnal tritium content is only about 1/4 of its
initial value.

≈

Finally, the last column shows what happens when the photon losses are
reduced, e.g., when the thermonuclear fuel is surrounded by a some material
opaque to low energy photons but relatively transparent to bremsstrahlung. Ti is
further reduced to
100 keV, the ﬁnal tritium content ratio is less than 1/5, and
the ﬁnal burn-up ratio is only 0.34.

≈

In conclusion, we have shown that by taking radiation effects such as inverse
Compton scattering fully into account the maximum burn temperature of a highly
compressed DD pellet is reduced from about 300 keV to only 100 keV. This

4

decrease in ion temperature leads to a substantial reduction in the fuel burn-up
ratio. Moreover, this decrease is such that tritium breeding by the DD reaction
is not sufﬁcient to replace the amount of tritium that is added to the deuterium
plasma in order to trigger ignition at less than 10 keV. These conclusions would be
reinforced by taking relativistic and degeneracy effects into account. Finally, if the
size of the pellet were larger, or if the fuel were surrounded by various materials,
as is the case in a realistic pellet design, the importance of radiation effects would
be further enhanced. These problems illustrate the difﬁculty of burning advanced
thermonuclear fuels, such as DTx, D3He, or p11B [9], relative to burning those
containing a large tritium fraction, such as DT or 6LiDT.

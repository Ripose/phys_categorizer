Abstract

The motion of ions in the ﬁelds B = B0ˆz and E = E0 ˆy cos(k⊥y − ωt) is con-
sidered. When ω ≫ Ωi and v⊥ ∼> ω/k⊥, the equations of motion may be reduced
to a set of diﬀerence equations. These equations exhibit stochastic behavior when
E0 exceeds a threshold. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient above the threshold is deter-
mined. Far above the threshold, ion Landau damping is recovered. Extension of
the method to include parallel propagation is outlined.

Presented at the International Workshop on Intrinsic Stochasticity in Plasmas,

ticity in Plasmas, edited by G. Laval and D. Gr´esillon (Editions de Physique

Equations of Motion

ing electrostatic wave,

Consider an ion in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld and a perpendicularly propagat-

B = B0ˆz,

E = E0 ˆy cos(k⊥y − ωt).

Normalizing lengths to k−1
law for the ion becomes

⊥ and times to Ω−1

(Ωi = qiB0/mi), the Lorentz force

¨y + y = α cos(y − νt),

˙x = y,

where

ν = ω/Ωi,

α =

.

We solve (2) by approximating the force due to the wave by impulses at
those points where the phase is slowly varying, i.e., at ˙y = ν. The trajectory of
the ion is given in Fig. 1. Expanding the trajectory about the resonance point,
we ﬁnd that the magnitude of the impulses is given by

(4)

where φc = yc − νtc and tc and yc are the time and position of the wave-particle
“collision.” We may determine the Larmor radius and phase of the ion at the end
of the jth orbit [the beginning of the (j + 1)th orbit] in terms of these quantities
at the beginning of the jth orbit. (Details are given in Ref. 1.) The resulting
diﬀerence equations are

Here r is the normalized Larmor radius, k⊥v⊥/Ωi, and n is an integer. The limits
of validity of (5) are

ν ≫ 1,

r − ν ≫ ( 1

A ≪ (r2 − ν2)3/2/r2.

In Fig. 2 we compare the trajectories obtained using the exact equations of
motion, (2), with those obtained from the diﬀerence equations, (5). We see that
the agreement is very good indicating that (5) is an excellent approximation of
(2).

There are three advantages to using the diﬀerence equations in preference
to the Lorentz force law. Firstly, they are much quicker to solve numerically.
Secondly, because of the way the equations were derived, the results are easier
to interpret. Lastly, the equations have separated out two velocity-space scales,
the ρ scale (∼ Ωi/k⊥) and the r scale (∼ ω/k⊥). We therefore treat A which
is a function of r as a constant when iterating the equations. This means that
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is independent of ρ and so is much easier to determine
numerically.

Examples of Trajectories

When A is inﬁnitesimal, (5) may be solved by integrating (summing?) over
unperturbed orbits. Substituting uj = u0 + 2πδj and vj = v0 + 2πδj into the
right hand sides of (5c) and (5d) gives

ρN − ρ0 = 2πA cos(ρ0 − πδ)

(−1)δ cos θ0 N,
sin(2πδN + θ0) − sin θ0
2 sin(πδ)

for δ = integer,

Note that the trajectory is secular or not depending on whether or not δ is
an integer (ω is a cyclotron harmonic). Formally, we may compute a diﬀusion
coeﬃcient using

which is the usual quasi-linear diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

If we consider ﬁnite but small A, then all the trajectories are bounded. There
are three distinct cases, δ = 0 (which is the case considered by Fukuyama et al.2),
δ = 1

2 . The trajectories for these cases are shown in Fig. 3.

2 , and δ 6= 0 or 1

– 4 –

When A is increased, the system undergoes a stochastic transition, an ex-
ample of which is shown in Fig. 4 for δ = 0.23. Below the stochasticity threshold,
nearly all the trajectories are integrable [Fig. 4(a)] or, if there are stochastic tra-
jectories, they are bounded in ρ [Fig. 4(b)]. Above the threshold, nearly all the
trajectories are stochastic and unbounded. The value of the threshold may be
numerically determined and is found to be A = As = 1
4 . Above this value of A,
the kick received by the ion during one transit through resonance is suﬃcient to
change the phase of the kick received when next in resonance by π/2.

Diﬀusion Coeﬃcient

When computing the diﬀusion coeﬃcient numerically, it is convenient to

work with the correlation function, Ck, where

aj is the particle acceleration, aj = ρj+1 −ρj, and the average is over an ensemble
of particles and over the length of a given trajectory (i.e., over j). Then the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D, is given by

Ck = hajaj+ki,

D =

C0 +

Ck.

∞

Xk=1

[This deﬁnition is equivalent to (10).] The advantages of deﬁning D in this way
are twofold. Firstly, the statistical ﬂuctuations in the computation are minimized.
Secondly, it is easy to introduce the eﬀects of collisions on the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.
This is accomplished as follows: If k0 is the mean number of cyclotron periods
between decorrelating collisions (such collisions need only result in deﬂection by
1/ν, a small angle), then the probability of such a collision taking place in k
periods is 1 − exp(−k/k0) since collisions are independent events. Collisions
may then be included in the computations of D by replacing Ck in (14) by
Ck exp(−k/k0).

In the limit A ≫ As, the kicks the ion receives are uncorrelated so that only
C0 is nonzero. Assuming that the trajectory is ergodic, we obtain D = 1
2 π2A2.
When A is not large, we account for the correlations between the kicks received
by the ion by writing

Numerically determining g(A) we ﬁnd that approximately

D = 1

2 π2A2g2(A),

g(A) = max(1 − A2

s/A2, 0),

with As = 1

In the limit A ≫ As, when g(A) ≈ 1, this is just the zero-magnetic-ﬁeld result,
0 ˆδ(ω − k⊥vy), averaged over Larmor phase. Thus, in this limit,
(π/2)(qi/mi)2E2
we recover ion Landau damping.

Extension to Parallel Propagation

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient was so easily calculated above because of the simp-
liﬁcation obtained by reducing the problem to diﬀerence equations, (5). This
reduction may be achieved in similar problems. We consider here the case where
the wave has some component of parallel propagation so that (1) becomes

B = B0ˆz,

E = E0(ˆy + kkˆz/k⊥) cos(k⊥y + kkz − ωt).

(18)

Adopting the same normalization as before, we obtain

where ζ = kk/k⊥. The diﬀerence equations for a particle with normalized Larmor
radius, r, and normalized parallel velocity, w = k⊥vk/Ωi, are

¨y + y = α cos(y + ζz − νt),

¨z = αζ cos(y + ζz − νt),

u = θ − ρ,

v = θ + ρ,

uj+1 − uj = 2πγj+1/2 − 2πA cos vj,

vj+1 − vj = 2πγj+1/2 + 2πA cos uj+1,

γj+1/2 = δ − β(ρj + πA cos vj),

where the variables θ and ρ are given by

θ = νt − ζz

(mod 2π),

ρ = (r2 − µ2)1/2 − µ cos−1(µ/r) + µπ − π/4 − 2πm.

Despite appearances δ is a parameter independent of ρ since the quantity µ + βρ
is a constant. (This follows from energy conservation in the wave frame.) The
restrictions on the validity of (20) are

A comparison between the exact equations of motion, (19), and the diﬀerence
equations, (20), is shown in Fig. 5 for ζ = 1 (propagation at 45◦). Again, there
is excellent agreement.

The results of Smith and Kaufman3 may be obtained in the limit β → ∞
and A → 0 (Q → 0). In that case, the change in ρ is negligible so that it is
necessary to rescale the velocity variable by deﬁning

Equation (20) then becomes

σj = 4πβρj − 2πδ.

θj+1 − θj = −σj − 1

2 K cos(θj + ρ),

σj+1 − σj = 1

2 K[cos(θj+1 − ρ) + cos(θj + ρ)],

where K = 4π2Aβ. In (26) ρ is a constant. Setting

ψ = σ + 1

2 Kcos(θ + ρ)

gives

θj+1 − θj = −ψj,

(28b)
This is the “standard mapping” studied by Chirikov.4 The island overlap condi-
tion for this mapping is |K cos ρ| > π2/4 or

ψj+1 − ψj = K cos ρ cos θj+1.

which is the stochasticity threshold obtained by Smith and Kaufman. The island
overlap criterion is a signiﬁcant overestimate of the stochasticity threshold for the
standard mapping.4 Greene5 has calculated that the true threshold is a factor
(π2/4)/0.971635 ≈ 2 1

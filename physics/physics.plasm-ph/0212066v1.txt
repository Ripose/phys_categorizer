1. Introduction

Kinetic theory is an important part of general statistical physics related
to phenomena which cannot be understood on the thermodynamic or ﬂuid
models level. First of all we mean (local) ﬂuctuations from equilibrium state
and a lot of complex phenomena 1. Also, it is well-known in plasma physics,
e.g., that only a kinetic approach can describe Landau damping, intra-beam
scattering, while Schottky noise and associated cooling techniques require
understanding of the spectrum of local ﬂuctuations of the beam charge
density 2.
In this paper we consider the applications of a new numeri-
cal/analytical technique based on wavelet analysis approach for calculations
related to the description of complex behaviour in the framework of the
general BBGKY–hierarchy 1. We restrict ourselves to rational/polynomial
type of nonlinearities (with respect to the set of all dynamical variables
(n-particle distribution functions in the case under consideration)) which
allows us to use our results from Refs. 3−9, which are based on the appli-
cation of wavelet analysis technique and variational formulation of initial
nonlinear (pseudodiﬀerential) problems.

Wavelet analysis is a set of mathematical methods which give us a pos-

2

3

sibility to work with well-localized bases in

functional spaces and provide maximum sparse forms for the general
type of operators (diﬀerential, integral, pseudodiﬀerential) in such bases.
It provides the best possible rates of convergence and minimal complexity
of algorithms inside and, as a result, saves CPU time and HDD space
10. Our main goals are an attempt of classiﬁcation and construction of
possible nontrivial states in the system under consideration. First of all
we are interested in the following states:
localized, chaotic-like patterns,
localized (stable) patterns. We start from the corresponding deﬁnitions (at
this stage these deﬁnitions have only qualitative character).

1. By localized state (localized mode) we mean the corresponding (par-
ticular) solution of the system under consideration which is localized in
maximally small region of the phase space.

2. By chaotic pattern we mean some solution (or asymptotics of solu-
tion) of the system under consideration which has equidistribution of energy
spectrum in a full domain of deﬁnition.

3. By localized pattern (waveleton) we mean (asymptotically) stable
solution localized in relatively small region of the whole phase space (or a
domain of deﬁnition).
In this case all energy is distributed during some
time (suﬃciently large) between few localized modes (from point 1) only.
We believe, it is a good model for a plasma fusion (energy conﬁnement) in
the nearest future. It is also obvious that such states are very important in
many areas of statistical physics.

In all cases above, by the system under consideration we mean the full
BBGKY–hierarchy or some cut-oﬀ of it. Our construction of cut-oﬀ of the
inﬁnite system of equations is based on some criterion of convergence of
the full solution. This criterion is based on a natural norm in a proper
functional space, which takes into account (non-perturbatively) the under-
lying multiscale structure of complex statistical dynamics. According to
our approach the choice of the underlying functional space is important
for understanding the corresponding complex dynamics. It is obvious that
we need to ﬁx accurately the space in which we construct the solutions,
evaluate convergence etc. and in which the very complicated inﬁnite set
of operators acts which appears in the BBGKY formulation. We underline
that many concrete features of the complex dynamics are related not only
to the concrete form/class of operators/equations but depend also on the
proper choice of function spaces, where operators act 9. It should be noted
that the class of smoothness of the functions under consideration plays a
key role in the following (more details will be considered elsewhere).

In Sec. 2 the kinetic BBGKY–hierarchy is formulated and an important

4

particular case is described. In Sec. 3 we present the explicit analytical
construction of solutions of the hierarchy, which is based on tensor alge-
bra extensions of bases generated by the hidden multiresolution structure
and proper variational formulation leading to an algebraic parametrization
of the solutions. We give the explicit representation of the hierarchy of
N-particle reduced distribution functions in the basis of highly-localized
generalized coherent (regarding the underlying aﬃne group) states given
by polynomial tensor algebra of wavelets, which takes into account contri-
butions from all underlying hidden multiscales, from the coarsest scale of
resolution to the ﬁnest one, to provide full information about stochastic
dynamical process. So, our approach resembles Bogolyubov’s and related
approaches but we don’t use any perturbation technique (like virial expan-
sion) or linearization procedures. Numerical modeling as in general case
as in particular cases of the Vlasov-like equations shows the creation of
various internal (coherent) structures from localized modes, which are re-
lated to stable (equilibrium) or unstable/chaotic type of behaviour and the
corresponding pattern (waveletons) formation.

In most cases, one is interested in a representation of the form

Fk(x1, . . . , xk; t) =
i=1 F1(xi; t) + Gk(x1, . . . , xk; t), where Gk are cor-
relators. Additional reductions often lead to simpliﬁcations, the simplest
one, Gk = 0, corresponding to the Vlasov approximation. Such physically
motivated ansatzes for Fk formally replace the linear (in Fk) and pseudod-
iﬀerential (in general case) inﬁnite system (6), (7) by a ﬁnite-dimensional
but nonlinear system with polynomial nonlinearities (more exactly, multi-
linearities) 10. Our key point in the following consideration is the proper
generalization of the perturbative multiscale approach of Bogolyubov.

3. Multiscale Analysis

The inﬁnite hierarchy of distribution functions satisfying system (6) in the
thermodynamical limit is:

F = {F0, F1(x1; t), F2(x1, x2; t), . . . , FN (x1, . . . , xN ; t), . . .},

(8)

where Fp(x1, . . . , xp; t) ∈ H p, H 0 = R, H p = L2(R6p) (or any diﬀerent
proper functional space), F ∈ H ∞ = H 0 ⊕ H 1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ H p ⊕ . . . with

Yℓ=1

First of all we consider F = F (t) as a function of time only, F ∈ L2(R), via
multiresolution decomposition which naturally and eﬃciently introduces
the inﬁnite sequence of the underlying hidden scales 10. Because the aﬃne
group of translations and dilations generates multiresolution approach, this
method resembles the action of a microscope. We have the contribution
to the ﬁnal result from each scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite
scale of spaces. We consider a multiresolution decomposition of L2(R) 10
(of course, we may consider any diﬀerent and proper for some particular
case functional space) which is a sequence of increasing closed subspaces
Vj ∈ L2(R) (subspaces for modes with ﬁxed dilation value):

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

(10)

The closed subspace Vj(j ∈ Z) corresponds to the level j of resolution, or to
the scale j and satisﬁes the following properties: let Wj be the orthonormal
Wj . Then we have
complement of Vj with respect to Vj+1: Vj+1 = Vj
the following decomposition:

or

{F (t)} = V0

in case when V0 is the coarsest scale of resolution. The subgroup of trans-
lations generates a basis for the ﬁxed scale number: spank∈Z{2j/2Ψ(2jt −
k)} = Wj . The whole basis is generated by action of the full aﬃne group:

spank∈Z,j∈Z {2j/2Ψ(2jt − k)} = spank,j∈Z {Ψj,k} = {F (t)}.

j corresponds to the multires-

E.g., for n = 2:
k2), ak1,k2 ∈ ℓ2(Z 2)}, where φ2(x1, x2) = φ1(x1)φ2(x2) = φ1 ⊗ φ2(x1, x2),
and φi(xi) ≡ φ(xi) form a multiresolution basis corresponding to {V xi
j }.
If {φ1(x1 − ℓ)}, ℓ ∈ Z form an orthonormal set, then φ2(x1 − k1, x2 − k2)
form an orthonormal basis for V 2
0 . So, the action of the aﬃne group gener-
ates multiresolution representation of L2(R2). After introducing the detail

0 . Then the 3-component basis for

0 is generated by the translations of three functions

Ψ2

1 = φ1(x1) ⊗ Ψ2(x2), Ψ2

2 = Ψ1(x1) ⊗ φ2(x2), Ψ2

3 = Ψ1(x1) ⊗ Ψ2(x2).

Also, we may use the rectangle lattice of scales and one-dimensional wavelet
decomposition:

f (x1, x2) =

hf, Ψi,ℓ ⊗ Ψj,kiΨj,ℓ ⊗ Ψj,k(x1, x2),

Xi,ℓ;j,k

where the basis functions Ψi,ℓ ⊗ Ψj,k depend on two scales 2−i and 2−j.
After constructing the multidimensional basis we may apply one of the
variational procedures from Refs. 3−9. We obtain our multiscale/multire-
solution representations (formulae (17) below) via the variational wavelet
approach for the following formal representation of the BBGKY system
(6) (or its ﬁnite-dimensional nonlinear approximation for the n-particle
distribution functions) with the corresponding obvious constraints on the
distribution functions.

Let L be an arbitrary (non)linear differential/integral operator with
matrix dimension d (ﬁnite or inﬁnite), which acts on some set of func-
tions from L2(Ω⊗n

Let us consider now the N mode approximation for the solution as the

ΨN (t, x1, x2, . . .) =

Xi0,i1,i2,...=1

We shall determine the expansion coeﬃcients from the following conditions
(diﬀerent related variational approaches are considered in 3−9):

(LΨN )Ak0 (t)Bk1 (x1)Ck2 (x2)dtdx1dx2 . . . = 0.

(16)

8

Thus, we have exactly dN n algebraical equations for dN n unknowns
ai0,i1,.... This variational approach reduces the initial problem to the prob-
lem of solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical
problems at the second. We consider the multiresolution expansion as the
second main part of our construction. So, the solution is parametrized
by the solutions of two sets of reduced algebraical problems, one is linear
or nonlinear (depending on the structure of the operator L) and the rest
are linear problems related to the computation of the coeﬃcients of the
algebraic equations (16). These coeﬃcients can be found by some wavelet
methods by using the compactly supported wavelet basis functions for the
expansions (15). As a result the solution of the equations (6) has the follow-
ing multiscale or multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high-localized
eigenmodes

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying
time/space scales. The formulae (17) give the expansion into a slow part
Ψslow
N,M and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary N, M . So, we may move from
the coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest ones for obtaining more detailed
information about the dynamical process. In this way one obtains contri-
butions to the full solution from each scale of resolution or each time/space
scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode. It should be noted that such repre-
sentations give the best possible localization properties in the correspond-
ing (phase)space/time coordinates. Formulae (17) do not use perturbation
techniques or linearization procedures. Numerical calculations are based
on compactly supported wavelets and related wavelet families 10 and on
evaluation of the accuracy on the level N of the corresponding cut-oﬀ of
the full system (6) regarding norm (9):

kF N +1 − F N k ≤ ε.

(18)

To summarize, the key points are:
1. The ansatz-oriented choice of the (multidimensional) basis related to

some polynomial tensor algebra.

2. The choice of a proper variational principle. A few projection (Galer-
kin-like) principles for constructing (weak) solutions are considered in 3−9.

The advantages of formulations related to biorthogonal (wavelet) decom-
position should be noted.

3. The choice of basis functions in the scale spaces Wj . They correspond
to highly-localized (nonlinear) oscillations/excitations, nontrivial local (sta-
ble) distributions/ﬂuctuations, etc. Besides fast convergence properties we
note the minimal complexity of all underlying calculations, especially by
choosing wavelet packets which minimize Shannon’s entropy.

4. Operator representations providing maximum sparse representations
for arbitrary (pseudo) diﬀerential/ integral operators df /dx, dnf /dxn,

T (x, y)f (y)dy), etc. 10.

5.

R
(Multi)linearization. Besides the variation approach we can con-
sider also a diﬀerent method to deal with (polynomial) nonlinearities: para-
products-like decompositions 10,9.

4. Example: Vlasov equation

As a particular case we consider the Vlasov approximations F2 = F1F1,
S3 F1(xi)F2(xj , xk) in Eqs. (7), which are important in
F3(x1, x2, x3) =
plasma physics.

P

This is a particular case of the general form (13) (for simplicity we

consider only one variable)

Q(R, x)Ψ(x) = P (R, x)Ψ(x)

or LΨ ≡ L(R, x)Ψ(x) = 0,

(19)

where R ≡ R(x, ∂/∂x, Ψ) is not more than a rational (operator) function.
We have the following representation for the N mode approximation for
the solution of the Vlasov equation via expansion in some high-localized
wavelet-like basis (other independent variables are considered analogously):

We shall determine the expansion coeﬃcients from the following variational
conditions:

ΨN (x) =

aN
r φr(x).

Xr=1

LN

k ≡

Z

(LΨN )φk(x)dx = 0.

We have exactly dN algebraical equations for dN unknowns ar.
So,
the variational approach reduces the initial problem (7) to the problem of
the solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical
problems at the second stage. As a result we have the following reduced
algebraical system of equations (RSAE) on the set of unknown coeﬃcients

We may extend our approach to the case when there are additional con-
straints on the set of dynamical variables and additional averaged terms
also. In these cases, by using the method of Lagrangian multipliers one
again may apply the same approach, but for the extended set of variables.
As a result, one obtains the expanded system of algebraical equations, anal-
ogous to the system (22). Then, one again can extract from its solution the
coeﬃcients of expansion (20). It should be noted that if one considers only
the truncated expansion (22) with N terms one has a system of N × d alge-
braical equations of degree ℓ = max{p, q} which coincides with the degree
of the initial system.

5. Demonstration of typical patterns

Formulae (15), (17), (20) provide, in principle, a fast convergent decomposi-
tion for the general solutions of the systems (6), (7) in terms of contributions
from all underlying hidden internal scales. Of course, we cannot guarantee
that each concrete system (6), (7) with ﬁxed coeﬃcients will have a priori
a speciﬁc type of behaviour, either localized or chaotic. Instead, we can
analyze if typical structures described by deﬁnitions 1-3 are present. To
classify the qualitative behaviour we apply standard methods from general
control theory or really use the control 9. We will start from a priori un-
known coeﬃcients, the exact values of which will subsequently be recovered.
Roughly speaking, we will ﬁx only class of nonlinearity (polynomial in our
case) which covers a broad variety of examples of systems (6), (7).

12

As a simple model we choose band-triangular non-sparse matrices (aij )
from (17) or (20) in particular cases. These matrices provide tensor struc-
ture of bases in (extended) phase space and are generated by the roots of
the reduced variational (Galerkin-like) systems (16) or (21), (22). As a sec-
ond step we need to restore the coeﬃcients of (6), (7) from these matrices
by which we may classify the types of behaviour. We start with the local-
ized mode, which is an “elementary” eigenfunction, Fig. 1, corresponding
to def. 1, which was constructed as a tensor product of the two Daubechies
functions. Fig. 2, corresponding to def. 2, presents the result of summation
of series (17) up to value of the dilation/scale parameter equal to six on the
bases of symmlets 10 with the corresponding matrix elements equal to one.
The size of matrix is 512x512 and as a result we provide modeling for one-
particle distribution function corresponding to standard Vlasov like-system
(7) with F2 = F 2
1 . So, diﬀerent possible distributions of the root values of
the generical algebraical system (22) provide qualitatively diﬀerent types
of behaviour. The above choice provides us by chaotic-like equidistribution
distribution. But, if we consider a band-like structure of matrix (aij ) with
the band along the main diagonal with ﬁnite size (≪ 512) and values, e.g.
ﬁve, while the other values are equal to one, we obtain localization in a
ﬁxed ﬁnite area of the full phase space, i.e. almost all energy of the system
is concentrated in this small volume. This corresponds to deﬁnition 3 and is
shown in Fig. 3, constructed by means of Daubechies-based wavelet pack-
ets. Depending on the type of solution, such localization may be present
during the whole time evolution (asymptotically-stable) or up to the needed
value from time scale (e.g. enough for plasma fusion/conﬁnement).

Now we discuss how to solve the inverse/synthesis problem or how to

restore the coeﬃcients of the initial systems (6), (7). Let

L0(Q0)Ψ0 = 0

(25)

be the system (13) with the ﬁxed coeﬃcients Q0. The corresponding
solution Ψ0 is represented by formulae (15), (17) or (20), which are
parametrized by roots of reduced algebraic system (22) and constructed
by some choice of the tensor product bases from part 1. The proper coun-
terpart of the system (25) with prescribed behaviour Ψu, corresponding
to a given choice of both tensor product structure and coeﬃcients {aij}
described above, corresponds to the class of systems like (13) but with
undetermined coeﬃcients Qu and has the same form

(26)
Our goal is to restore coeﬃcients Qu from (25), (26) and explicit represen-
tations for solutions Ψ0 and Ψu. This is a standard problem in the adaptive

Lu(Qu)Ψu = 0.

control theory 11: one adds a controlling signal u(x, t) which deforms the
controlled signal Ψ(x, t) from the ﬁxed state Ψ0(x, t) to the prescribed one
Ψu(x, t). At the same time one can determine the parameters Qu 3. Finally,
we apply two variational constructions. The ﬁrst one gives the systems of
algebraic equations for unknown coeﬃcients, generated by the following set
of functionals

ΦN =

(L0 − Lu)Ψu

N , Ψ0
N

dµN ,

Z (cid:16)

(cid:17)

(27)

where N means the N -order approximation according to formulae (15).
The unknown parameters Q∗ are given by Q∗ = limN→∞ Qu
N . The second
is an important additional constraint on the region µ0 in the phase space
H(Ψu)dµ,
where we are interested in localization of almost all energy E =
where E is the proper energy functional 2 (Marsden-like).

R

We believe that the appearance of nontrivial localized patterns observed
by these simple methods is a general eﬀect which is also present in the full
BBGKY–hierarchy, due to its complicated intrinsic multiscale dynamics
and it depends on neither the cut-oﬀ level nor the phenomenological-like
hypothesis on correlators. So, representations like (17) and the prediction of
the existence of the (asymptotically) stable localized patterns/states (en-
ergy conﬁnement states) in BBGKY-like systems are the main results of
this paper.

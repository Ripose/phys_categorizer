Abstract. Hot electron temperatures and electron energy spectra in the course of
interaction between intense laser pulse and overdense plasmas are reexamined from a
viewpoint of the diﬀerence in laser wavelength. The hot electron temperature measured
by a particle-in-cell simulation is scaled by I rather than Iλ2 at the interaction with
overdense plasmas with ﬁxed ions, where I and λ are the laser intensity and wavelength,
respectively.

1. Introduction

The interaction of intense laser pulses with overdense plasmas has attracted much
interest for the fast ignitor concept in inertial fusion energy [1]. The interaction of
ultrashort intense laser pulses with thin solid targets have also been of great interest for
the application to high energy ion sources [2]. Ultraintense irradiation experiments using
an infrared subpicosecond laser, e.g., Nd:glass (λ = 1,053 nm) or Ti:sapphire (λ =800
nm) lasers, whose powers and focused intensities exceed 100 TW and 1020 W/cm2,
are possible using chirped pulse ampliﬁcation techniques [3]. In these experiments, the
classical normalized momentum of electrons a0
1,
where m is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, I is the laser intensity in W/cm2,
and λµ is the wavelength in µm. On the other hand, a KrF laser (λ = 248 nm) has
an advantage as the fast ignitor in that the critical density is close to the core, and
hot electron energies are suitable since the critical density of the KrF laser is ten times
greater than that of an infrared laser [4]. The peak intensities of KrF laser systems
were only the order of 1018 W/cm2, namely a0 < 1 [5]. Therefore, the dependence of
the laser plasma interactions on the laser wavelength was not investigated in a0
1.
Recently, the laser absorption and hot electron generation have been studied by the high
intensity KrF laser system of which focused intensity is greater than 1019 W/cm2 [6].
However, the production of hot electrons by the high intensity KrF laser has not been

The absorption, electron energy spectrum, and hot electron temperature have
usually been investigated and scaled using the parameters Iλ2, ne/nc, and L/λ [7, 8],
where ne, nc, and L are the electron density, critical density, and density scale length,
respectively. Critical density absorption of the laser light converts laser energy into hot
electrons having a suprathermal temperature Th approximately proportional to √Iλ2
1]mc2 at moderate densities [9], where mc2 = 511
for a0 > 1, and Th
keV, m is an electron rest mass. The scaling of the hot electron temperature has
been supported by experiments of Nd:glass and Ti:sapphire lasers [10]. On the other
hand, the results of one-dimensional simulation for normal incidence in the density
region 4 < ne/nc < 100 and the normalized intensity 4 < a2
0 < 30 have shown that

weakly on Iλ2 and ne/nc [8]. β is weakly depend on the angle of incidence, absorption
rate, and ne0/nc [11]. The hot electron temperature is scaled by the amplitude of
electromagnetic ﬁelds at the plasma surface rather than that in vacuum; namely, the
hot electron temperature is slightly dependent on the wavelength.

In addition, at the interaction of intense laser pulses with solid density plasma which
has a sharp density gradient the hot electron temperature is scaled by Iλ−1 rather than
Iλ2 [12]. In the present paper, we study the absorption of ultrashort intense laser pulses
on overdense plasmas for diﬀerent laser wavelengths (λ = 0.25, 0.5, and 1 µm) using a
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation.

In order to investigate hot electron generation for oblique incidence, we use the
relativistic 1 and 2/2 dimensional PIC simulation with the boost frame moving with
c sin θ parallel to the target surface, where c and θ are the speed of light and an angle of
incidence [13]. In the simulation, the target is the fully ionized plastic and the electron
1023cm−3. The density correspond to ne0/nc = 20, 78, and 310
density ne0
for λ = 0.25, 0.5, and λ = 1µm, respectively. The density proﬁle has a sharp density
gradient, ne(x) = ne0 for x
0 and ne(x) = 0 for x < 0. In order to clarify the boundary
eﬀect, ions are ﬁxed, namely, the boundary does not move all the time. The laser pulse
starts at x < 0 and propagates towards x > 0. The laser intensity rises in 5 fs and
1019 W/cm2 and the angle
remains constant after that. The irradiated intensity I = 5

s = 0.12β for all wavelength. Normalized
electron energy distributions after 50 fs are shown in Fig.1(a) and 1(b) for θ = 30◦
and 45◦, respectively. The hot electron temperatures are 140 and 340 keV for θ = 30◦
and 45◦, respectively. The hot electron temperatures does not depend on the laser
wavelength. The result is well agreement with that of a simple sharp boundary theory.

On the other hand, the absorption depends on the laser wavelength, A(θ = 30◦) =
0.9-1.8%, 2.2-3.0%, and 3.6-4.3% and A(θ = 45◦) = 2.6-4.1%, 5.3-6.7%, and 7.8-9.0%
for λ = 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 µm, respectively.

3. Concluding Remarks

The eﬀects of laser wavelength on hot electrons produced by ultrashort intense laser
pulse on solid-density targets are studied by the use of a PIC simulation. As a result,
the dependence to the wavelength of hot electron temperature strongly depend on the
boundary condition, even in the one dimensional case, namely, all are not determined
only by Iλ2. The density proﬁles of both preformed plasma [16] and multi-dimensional
eﬀects such as surface deformation [9] are very important in the actual experiments.

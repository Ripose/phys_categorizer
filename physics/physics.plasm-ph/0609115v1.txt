Comparison between resistive and collisionless double tearing modes
for nearby resonant surfaces

(Dated: February 9, 2014)

The linear instability characteristics and nonlinear dynamics of collisional (resistive) and colli-
sionless (electron inertia) double tearing modes (DTMs) are compared using a reduced cylindrical
model of a tokamak plasma. We focus on cases where two q = 2 resonant surfaces are located a
small distance apart. It is found that regardless of the magnetic reconnection mechanism, resistivity
or electron inertia, the dominant modes are those with high poloidal mode numbers m ∼ 10. How-
ever, the collisionless case tends to have a signiﬁcantly broader spectrum of unstable modes. In the
nonlinear regime, it is shown that in both cases the fast growing high-m DTMs lead to a turbulent
collapse in an annular region, whereat small magnetic island structures are formed. In addition,
collisionless DTMs exhibit multiple reconnection cycles due to reversibility and strong E × B ﬂows.
Collisionless reconnection leads to a saturated stable state, while in the collisional case resistive
decay keeps the system weakly dynamic by driving it back towards the unstable equilibrium.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Non-monotonic current density proﬁles, where the
maximum current density is located oﬀ the magnetic axis,
are frequently produced in tokamak plasmas (see Ref. [1]
and references therein). These so-called reversed-shear
(RS) conﬁgurations are of considerable interest for estab-
lishing high-performance discharges with improved con-
ﬁnement (e.g., Refs. [2, 3]). The non-monotonic current
proﬁle is associated with a safety factor proﬁle q(r) that
has a minimum qmin at some radius rmin > 0. Around
rmin, pairs of magnetic surfaces where q has the same ra-
tional value qs = m/n can occur a small distance D12
apart. Under such conditions, coupled resonant per-
turbations (with poloidal mode number m and toroidal
mode number n) known as double tearing modes (DTMs)
can become unstable [4, 5].

The DTM is a stronger instability than an ordinary
tearing mode [6] and bears similarity with the m = 1
internal kink mode [5, 7]. Several nonlinear studies on
cases with relatively large inter-resonance distances and
dominant low-m modes where conducted in the past
It has recently been shown
(e.g., Refs. [8, 9, 10, 11]).
that DTMs with high poloidal mode numbers m
10
are strongly unstable when the distance between the res-
onances is small [12]. Details about the linear instability
characteristics of such cases were presented in Ref. [1] for
resistive DTMs.

∼

The present paper is motivated by the question how
the linear instability and nonlinear evolution of high-m
DTMs, in conﬁgurations with small inter-resonance dis-
tance D12, depend on the reconnection mechanism. In
particular, a comparison is made between collisional and

sity of California, Irvine, CA 92697

collisionless DTMs in which magnetic reconnection is me-
diated by resistivity and electron inertia, respectively.
The practical motivation for this work lies in the fact
that scenarios with small distance D12 inevitably occur
during the evolution of the q proﬁle when qmin passes
through low-order rational values qs. Moreover, in toka-
mak plasmas of interest to thermonuclear fusion appli-
cations the classical resistivity is low, so models with
collisionless reconnection mechanisms may give a more
realistic picture (unless the eﬀective resistivity is much
higher than the classical one [13, 14]). The results may
thus be useful for understanding magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) activity observed near qmin in RS tokamak con-
ﬁgurations [15, 16] and may bear relevance for problems
of stability, conﬁnement and current proﬁle control.

Due to similarities between strongly coupled DTMs
and m = 1 internal kink modes the present work is re-
lated to previous studies on fast collisionless reconnec-
tion, some of which used a model similar to the reduced
set of MHD equations employed here [17, 18, 19]. For the
purpose of simplicity and transparency, some potentially
important physical eﬀects (e.g., ﬁnite-Larmor-radius cor-
rections and diamagnetic drifts [20, 21]) are ignored at
the present stage.

In the ﬁrst part of this paper, it is shown that col-
lisionless DTMs also have a broad spectrum with dom-
inant high-m modes when the inter-resonance distance
is small, so they are similar in this respect to resistive
DTMs. When resistivity or the electron skin depth are
increased, the mode number of the fastest growing mode
mpeak increases. A signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two
cases is that increasing electron inertia also increases the
width of the spectrum, while resistive DTMs tend to have
a ﬁxed spectral width.

In the second part, nonlinear simulation results are
presented. Both cases, resistive and collisionless, have
in common the formation of small magnetic islands, si-
multaneous reconnection at many locations around the
core plasma (annular collapse), and generation of MHD

×

turbulence.
In addition, the collisionless reconnection
scenario has the distinctive feature of being reversible
[19]. Together with the high growth rates (which result
in strong E
B ﬂows), reversibility allows for multiple
reconnection cycles. Secondary reconnection was previ-
ously demonstrated for the m = 1 internal kink mode [18]
and is here shown to occur in similar form with DTMs.
It is essentially an overshoot phenomenon and thus much
more pronounced in systems where dissipation is weak.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II the
physical model is introduced and Section III contains de-
tails on the numerical method employed. In Section IV
we describe the equilibrium conﬁguration used and its
linear instability characteristics. Nonlinear simulation re-
sults are presented in Section V, followed by a discussion
and conclusions in Section VI.

II. MODEL

We use a reduced set of magnetohydrodynamic
(RMHD) equations in cylindrical geometry in the limit of
zero pressure [22, 23]. The RMHD model has proven to
be useful in studies of MHD instabilities when the focus
is on a qualitative description of fundamental aspects of
the magnetized plasma system, as is the case here. We
use an Ohm’s law that includes resistivity and electron
inertia terms,

(constant loop voltage, E0 = const). For simplicity, the
temporal variation of the resistivity proﬁle ˆη is neglected.
The eﬀect of SHpE0 is negligible in the collisionless case,
and there ˆη = 1 is used.

version of the numerical code described above) and an
eigenvalue-problem (EVP) solver [1]. The results of both
approaches agree. Output data obtained with the EVP
solver which the IVP solver cannot produce [such as
multiple eigenmodes for a given (m, n)] were veriﬁed by
checking the numerical convergence with increasing grid
density.

IV. EQUILIBRIUM AND LINEAR
INSTABILITY

The equilibrium state is taken to be axisymmetric
(only m = n = 0 components) and free of ﬂows, i.e.,
φ = u = 0. The equilibrium magnetic conﬁguration is
uniquely deﬁned in terms of the safety factor q(r). The
magnetic ﬂux function and current density proﬁles are
given by the relations

FIG. 4: (Color online). Eigenmode structures for collisionless modes with (m, n) = (2, 1) and (10.5) in dependence of de. The
eigenmode of type M (2) (a,b,e,f) is unstable in the whole range of de shown in Fig. 3 and has odd parity. M (1)-type modes

show that the dominance of modes with m > 2 for small
distance D12 is a feature common to both collisional [1]
and collisionless DTMs.

≤

A remarkable diﬀerence between collisional and colli-
sionless DTMs is that mmax, the mode number of the
last unstable mode (gγlin(m) > 0 for m
mmax) in-
creases with increasing de, as can be seen in Fig. 2. In
the case of collisional DTMs a variation of SHp does not
aﬀect mmax (here mmax = 16) (cf. also Ref. [1]). This
property has the important implication that the insta-
bility of a DTM with a given mode number m is not
determined by the global current proﬁle. Although, this
observation is not yet fully understood, it seems that the
detailed structure of the mode near the resonant surfaces
also plays a role. Further calculations show that setting
the electron viscosity µe to zero reduces the growth rates
in the high-m domain, but it does not remove the char-
acteristic high-m tail of the collisionless DTM spectrum.
The de dependence of the growth rates of individual
modes is shown in Fig. 3 for (m, n) = (2, 1), (6, 3) and
(10, 5) for SHp = 108 and ReHp = 107. The collisional

regime is identiﬁed with the region de . 7
the electron inertia plays no signiﬁcant role. In the range
10−3 < de . 10−2 we speak of collisionless DTMs. Here
the growth rates rise steeply with de, whereat the (10, 5)
mode undergoes the strongest destabilization among the
modes plotted. Finally, for de > 10−2 the skin depth
becomes comparable to the inter-resonance distance D12
and one may expect that here the nature of the insta-
bility changes [28]. In fact, in this regime a second un-
stable eigenmode arises for each (m, n) (small symbols
connected by dashed lines in Fig. 3).

×

The eigenmode structures for collisionless modes with
(m, n) = (2, 1) and (10, 5) are shown in Fig. 4. The M (2)-
type mode is the dominant one in the regime considered
here. It is similar to its resistive equivalent described in

Ref. [1]. Both have odd parity, meaning that the mag-
netic islands at rs1 are half a wavelength out of phase
with those at rs2. The slower M (1)-type mode has even
parity (islands in phase). However, in contrast to the
even-parity resistive M (1)-type mode [1], which is found
in the limit of large D12 (and eventually becomes a single
tearing mode), the collisionless M (1)-type mode appears
de and peaks at both resonant sur-
in the limit of D12 ∼
faces.

V. NONLINEAR RESULTS

s ζ is a helical angle coordinate and ϑ0m is an
initial phase shift. The values ϑ0,m = 0 or ϑ0,m = π are
assigned to each m in a random manner. This introduces
some degree of incoherence while retaining mirror sym-
metry about both the x and the y axis (due to qs = 2
and parity conservation in RMHD). This restriction is
applied for convenience and higher numerical accuracy,
and has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the phenomena discussed
in this paper.

The early evolution begins with a linear phase followed
by one where low-m modes are nonlinearly driven by the
faster high-m modes. These stages were discussed in de-
tail in Refs. [12, 29, 30] and are found to be similar here.
Thus, in the following, we focus on the subsequent fully
nonlinear regime.

proﬁle during the annular collapse.

The nonlinear simulation for the collisional case was
carried out for the parameter values SHp = 106, ReHp =
107 and de = 0. A time series of six snapshots (A)–
(F), each containing contour plots of the helical ﬂux
ψ∗ = ψ + r2/(2qs) and the electrostatic potential φ, is
shown in Fig. 5.
In the present case, the initial per-
turbation has triggered the ﬁrst islands near the verti-
cal (y) axis [Fig. 5(A)]. Their size corresponds roughly
to m = 8, which is consistent with the fact that the
m = 8 mode is the linearly fastest growing one in this
setting (cf. Fig. 10 in Ref. [1]). The perturbation spreads
out poloidally (B)–(E) towards the horizontal (x) axis.
Eventually, the whole inter-resonance region is disrupted,
predominantly by a nonlinear m = 8 DTM (D)–(F). The
relaxation leads to a state with low magnetic shear in
the former inter-resonance region (F). This can also be

during the period 1000 . t . 1400, the contour plots in
Fig. 5 show that high-m islands are present at all times.

FIG. 8: (Color online). Collisionless case. Reconnection dynamics with qs = 2 collisionless DTMs for small inter-resonance
distance D12 = 0.06. The twelve snapshots (A)–(L) were taken during the interval 900 ≤ t ≤ 2200. Labeled arrows in (A)–(D)
indicate primary (P) and secondary reconnection (S) events [ﬁrst cycle: (A) and (B); second cycle: (C) and (D)]. Arrows in
(D)–(F) highlight islands revolving around each other. Otherwise arranged as Fig. 5. Parameters: SHp = 108, ReHp = 107,
de = 0.01.

The evolution of the magnetic energy of the (0, 0)
mode, Emag
in Fig. 7(b), is closely linked to the evo-
0,0
lution of the q proﬁle in Fig. 6. Emag
reaches its peak
0,0
shortly after the (8, 4) mode has grown to its maximum
around t = 1800. It this point the m = 8 islands reach
their maximal size [Fig. 5(E)] and the system has ex-
hausted most of its free energy. Secondary reconnection
(overshoot) occurs only in rudimentary form (E)–(F).

For t > 2000 the energy of the proﬁle perturbation
Emag
0,0 decays. Correspondingly, the q proﬁle does not rise
2 in the region
further and tends to remain close to q
rs1 . r . rs3. qmin even drops back slighly below qs = 2.
This behavior is most likely due to the resistive decay of
ψ0,0 because the resistive time
the proﬁle perturbation
e
scale τR for the inter-resonance region is comparable to
the simulation time: τR(D12)/τHp = ˆη−1SHp(D12/2)2
∼
103. Since the source term S−1
HpE0 in Eq. (2) maintains
the original equilibrium proﬁle the dissipation tends to

≈

drive the system back to the initial unstable state. The
system is expected to settle down in a state where the
decay of Emag
0,0

is balanced by weak MHD activity.

The nonlinear simulation for the collisionless case was
carried out for the parameter values SHp = 108, ReHp =
107 and de = 0.01. The de value is just on the mar-
gin of the regime where it becomes comparable to the
inter-resonance distance D12 (cf. Fig. 2). Although the
resistivity is ﬁnite, it is small enough for its eﬀect to be
negligible for both the linear instability characteristics
and the prominent features of the nonlinear dynamics.

Consider the sequence of twelve snapshots (A)–(L)
shown in Fig. 8. As in the collisional case, the ﬁrst is-
lands appear near the y axis [Fig. 8(A)]. In accordance
with the value of mpeak = 8 (cf. Fig. 2), the island sizes
roughly correspond to m = 8. Primary and secondary
reconnection events can be observed. Here, primary re-
connection (P) is the process where an island forms. Dur-

proﬁle during the annular collapse.

ing the secondary reconnection (S) the island disappears
at another location (usually on the opposite side of the
inter-resonance region). We regard primary followed by
secondary reconnection as one reconnection cycle.
In
Fig. 8 (A) and (B), one such cycle is indicated by ar-
rows labeled (P)1 and (S)1. As can be seen in snapshots
(C) and (D), the residual E
B ﬂows in the upper part
×
of the poloidal plane are strong enough to create another
island (P)2 which is also annihilated later through sec-
ondary reconnection (S)2. Snapshots (D)–(F) reveal tur-
bulent ﬂows that cause islands to revolve around each
other (arrows). In the following snapshots, (G)–(L), the
magnetic islands gradually disappear. Turbulent small-
scale ﬂows can still be observed, but with signiﬁcantly
reduced energies.

A remarkable diﬀerence to the collisional case lies
in the fact that after collisionless reconnection the
inter-resonance region again has distinct ﬂux surfaces
[Fig. 8(F)]. As can be seen in Fig. 9, the q proﬁle has
changed (widened) outside the original qs = 2 resonant
surfaces and the relaxed state has q > 2 everywhere.
The magnetic energy of the proﬁle perturbation, Emag
0,0
shown in Fig. 10(b), is found to rise relatively steadily to
a level much higher than in the collisional case. More-
over, Emag
seems to saturate rather than decay. This
0,0
may again be understood in terms of the local resistive
diﬀusion time, which is now much larger than the simu-
lation time: τR(D12)

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In tokamak plasmas with non-monotonic q proﬁle pairs
of nearby resonant surfaces with the same rational value
qs = m/n are produced, Examples include the current
ramp-up [31, 32], the current penetration after an inter-
nal disruption [33], and enhanced RS shear conﬁgurations
where bootstrap current and external drive maintain an

oﬀ-axis current peak (e.g., Ref. [16]). Motivated by the
recent ﬁnding that high-m DTMs may be strongly unsta-
ble in such conﬁgurations shortly after qmin drops below
a low-order rational value [1, 12] we have analyzed the
linear instabiliy characteristics and nonlinear evolution
of collisional and collisionless DTMs associated with a
pair of nearby qs = 2 resonant surfaces.

A comparison between the two cases showed that both
can give rise fast growing DTMs with similar linear mode
structure and high mode numbers m
10. A random
broad-band perturbation was shown to induce an annu-
lar collapse with small island structures, both in the colli-
sional and collisonless case. This is in contrast to the sit-
uation typically found for large inter-resonance distances
where the lowest-m modes dominate and produce large
coherent island structures in the early stages of the non-

∼

linear evolution (e.g., Refs. [8, 34]). The dominance of
the fastest growing high-m modes survives far into the
nonlinear regime. The detailed evolution depends on the
initial conditions used in the calculation, i.e., the rela-
tive initial amplitudes of the modes and their phase rela-
tions [30]. The disruption may begin relatively localized
poloidally (as in Figs. 5 and 8) or everywhere simultane-
ously. In any case, the ﬁnal result, namely the disruption
of the whole inter-resonance region, is independent of the
initial perturbation. The disrupted region is character-
ized by reduced magnetic shear and MHD turbulence.

Due to the similarity of collisional and collisionless
DTMs with respect to the properties mentioned above it
may be conjectured that the dominance of high-m modes
in conﬁgurations with suﬃciently small inter-resonance
distance is a common feature of DTMs regardless of the
reconnection mechanism. However, there are also certain
diﬀerences.

The nature of the reconnection mechanism does have
an inﬂuence on the width of the spectrum of unstable
modes. It was found that, with the same q proﬁle, many
high-m DTMs which are stable with resistive reconnec-
tion become unstable when the electron inertia eﬀect
dominates. This has the important implication that the
instability of a DTM with given mode numbers (m, n) is
not determined by the current proﬁle alone, an observa-
tion which requires further investigation.

The reconnection and island dynamics in the collisional
and collisionless case are fundamentally diﬀerent from
each other. After the annular collapse in the collisional
case the proﬁle perturbation decays rapidly due to the
dissipative nature of the system. It is driven back towards

8

the initial unstable state, a tendency which is balanced
by continued (weak) MHD activity. The relaxed helical
ﬂux proﬁle ψ∗(r) is ﬂat in the inter-resonance region as
can be seen in Fig. 11 (dash-dotted line).
In contrast,
the collisionless case passes through multiple cycles of
primary and secondary reconnection, during which the
energy of the proﬁle perturbation continuously rises until
it saturates nonlinearly. The relaxed state is stable as can
be inferred from the helical ﬂux proﬁle in Fig. 11 (solid
line).

The results for qs = 2 DTMs are directly applicable to
other values of qs [12]. This includes cases with nearby
qs = 1 resonant surfaces for which the dynamics of resis-
tive DTMs were recently described in Ref. [30].

The results presented in the present paper motivate
further investigations using more realistic models. To
check our conjecture that for small inter-resonance dis-
tances high-m DTMs may be unstable with any recon-
nection mechanism, it may be necessary to include ﬁnite-
Larmor-radius (FLR) eﬀects in the generalized Ohm’s
law [Eq. (1)]. This is because in a tokamak the ion sound
radius ρs is usually larger, or at least comparable to the
electron skin depth de. Furthermore, de is replaced by a
beta-modiﬁed natural scale length ds [35].

Abstract. During the recovery phase of a magnetic storm, ﬂuxes of relativistic

(> 1 MeV) electrons in the inner magnetosphere (3 ≤ L ≤ 6) increase to beyond

pre-storm levels, reaching a peak about 4 days after the initiation of the storm. In order

to account for the generation of these “killer electrons”, a model is presented primarily

based on stochastic acceleration of electrons by enhanced whistler-mode chorus. In

terms of a quasi-linear formulation, a kinetic (Fokker-Planck) equation for the electron

energy distribution is derived, comprising an energy diﬀusion coeﬃcient based on

gyroresonant electron-whistler-mode wave interaction and parallel wave propagation; a

source term representing substorm-produced (lower energy) seed electrons; and a loss

term representing electron precipitation due to pitch-angle scattering by whistler-mode

waves and EMIC waves. Steady-state solutions for the electron energy distribution are

constructed, and ﬁtted to an empirically-derived relativistic Maxwellian distribution

for the high energy “hard” electron population at geosynchronous orbit. If the average

whistler amplitude is suﬃciently large, for instance 75 pT – 400 pT, dependent on the

values of the other model parameters, and assuming a background plasma density of
N0 = 10 cm−3 outside the plasmasphere, then a good ﬁt to the empirical distribution

is obtained, and corresponds to a timescale for the formation of the high-energy steady

state distribution of 3 – 5 days. For a lower representative value of the background
plasma density, N0 = 1 cm−3, smaller whistler amplitudes, in the range 13 – 72 pT,

can produce the high-energy distribution in the required time frame of several days. It

is concluded from the model calculations that the process of stochastic acceleration by

gyroresonant electron-whistler-mode wave interaction, in conjunction with pitch-angle

scattering by EMIC waves, constitutes a viable mechanism for generating “killer

electrons” during geomagnetic storms. The mechanism is expected to be particularly

eﬀective for the class of small and moderate storms possessing a long-lasting recovery

phase during which many substorms occur.

1. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that variations in the ﬂuxes of relativistic electrons, of kinetic

energies > 1 MeV, in the inner magnetosphere (3 ≤ L ≤ 6) are related to disturbed

magnetospheric conditions commonly called “magnetic storms”. Typically, for many

storms the electron ﬂuxes diminish rapidly during the main phase of the storm . The

main phase depletion of relativistic electrons occurs in association with large negative

values of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld Bz and large sudden increases in the solar

wind density and pressure [Paulikas and Blake, 1979; Blake et al., 1997]. Subsequently,

during the recovery phase of the storm, ﬂuxes increase to beyond pre-storm levels and

peak about 4 days after the initiation of the storm [Paulikas and Blake, 1979; Baker

et al., 1986, 1994a, 1997; Nagai, 1988; Li et al., 1997a; Reeves et al., 1998]. These

enhancements in ﬂuxes of relativistic electrons, which are colloquially referred to as

“killer electrons”, have become the subject of considerable attention by magnetospheric

physicists. Not only do the enhancements constitute an intrinsically interesting physics

problem in the near-Earth space, but they constitute a potentially serious hazard to

satellites, space stations, and, conceivably, humans in space. In fact, satellite disfunctions

(“anomalies”) have been linked to the eﬀects of relativistic electron increases [Baker et

al., 1994b, 1997], and the state of the radiation belt environment has become a major

concern in space weather forecasting [e.g., Baker, 1998; Reeves, 1998a]. The region near

geosynchronous (or geostationary) orbit, L ≃ 6.6, in the geographic equatorial plane,

is of particular interest because it is the operating zone of many orbiting satellites.

Reeves [1998b] has recently examined the relationship between relativistic electron

enhancements at geosynchronous orbit and magnetic storms as measured by the Dst

index. In particular, the 30 most intense relativistic electron events during 1992-1995

were examined, and it was found that every relativistic electron event was associated

with a magnetic storm as indicated by the Dst index, though a small fraction (about

10%) of magnetic storms did occur with no increase in relativistic electron ﬂuxes. Thus,

4

one conclusion from Reeves’ [1998b] analysis is that intense solar wind conditions are

necessary to generate strong relativistic electron enhancements. Nevertheless, despite the

accumulated magnetic storm data from satellites over many years, including coordinated

observations from the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) constellation of

spacecraft and other multi-satellite missions [e.g., Baker et al., 1997; Reeves et al.,

1998], there is, as yet, no accepted explanation for the generation of the relativistic

electrons. Speciﬁcally, it is not known exactly how, where, or when the electrons are

accelerated. Various energization mechanisms have been proposed, and most of these

are reviewed by Li et al. [1997a]. It appears easier to explain the main phase depletion

of energetic electrons than their subsequent recovery and enhancement. The drop in

relativistic electron ﬂuxes near geosynchronous orbit is partly due to adiabatic responses

(conserving all three adiabatic invariants) to magnetic ﬁeld decreases, as reﬂected in

the reduction in Dst index [e.g., Kim and Chan, 1997]. Nevertheless, Li et al. [1997a]

show that other physical mechanisms, including precipitation, must also contribute to

the depletion. It has been suggested that radial diﬀusion [Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974],

invoked to explain the existence of the outer electron radiation belt itself, could also

generate electrons of MeV energies in the inner magnetosphere. This mechanism, which

involves inwardly transporting energetic electrons from a presumed source in the outer

magnetosphere (in the tail), can produce such energies during relatively quiet periods

[e.g., Selesnick and Blake, 1997a], although the process is too slow during active times

[Li et al., 1997a; Blake et al., 1998]. Certain global recirculation processes, involving

radial diﬀusion, have also been proposed to generate relativistic electrons [e.g., Baker et

al., 1986, 1989; Fujimoto and Nishida, 1990], though these have proved inadequate, as

the transport rates are too slow. Sheldon et al. [1998] have recently identiﬁed the outer

polar cusp region as a potential acceleration region of the magnetosphere and possible

source of energetic electrons for the outer radiation belt, though further calculations

are needed to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the study. In another mechanism still to

5

be fully evaluated, Rostoker et al.

[1998] and Liu et al.

[1999] make the case that

large-amplitude ULF pulsations have the potential to supply the energy necessary to

create the enhanced relativistic electron ﬂuxes. In a 3D global MHD simulation of the

rapid rise of relativistic electron ﬂuxes during the January 1997 magnetic cloud event,

Hudson et al. [1999a, b] also found that ULF oscillations may play a role in energizing

relativistic electrons, via a mechanism involving drift-resonant acceleration and radial

transport.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that electrons are accelerated to relativistic (>

1 MeV) energies in situ in the inner magnetosphere [e.g., Blake et al., 1998]. Signiﬁcant

evidence in support of this conclusion is the observation by Selesnick and Blake [1997b]

that the phase space density of electrons of greater than MeV energies peaks near L=4

to L=5 during storms. As a result of substorm activity, electrons with energies up to

∼ 300 keV are injected near geosynchronous orbit [Cayton et al., 1989; Baker et al.,

1989, 1998]. These electrons appear to form the source population for the relativistic

electrons of greater than MeV energies that are subsequently observed. Summers et al.

[1998, 1999] have shown that whistler-mode waves could provide an eﬀective mechanism

for accelerating electrons from energies near 100 keV to above 1 MeV in the region

outside the plasmapause during the storm recovery phase. In a survey of potential

wave modes for electron scattering and stochastic acceleration to relativistic energies

during magnetic storms, Horne and Thorne [1998] concluded, in particular, that in

low density regions of the magnetosphere where the electron gyrofrequency exceeds

the electron plasma frequency, there are four potential wave modes that can resonate

with electrons in the energy range 100 keV to a few MeV: the whistler, LO, RX, and Z

modes. The concept of stochastic acceleration of electrons by whistler-mode waves in

the magnetosphere has also been discussed by Temerin et al. [1994], Li et al. [1997a],

Temerin [1998], and Roth et al. [1999]. It is the purpose of present paper to quantify the

model presented qualitatively in Section 8 of Summers et al. [1998] for the stochastic

6

acceleration of relativistic electrons during geomagnetic storms. Essential ingredients

in the model are the spatial regions within the inner magnetosphere 3 ≤ L ≤ 9 where

enhanced whistler-mode chorus [Tsurutani and Smith, 1974, 1977; Koons and Roeder,

1990; Parrot and Gaye, 1994] and enhanced electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC or

L-mode) waves occur [Cornwall et al., 1970; Perraut et al., 1976; Jordanova et al.,

1997; Kozyra et al., 1997]; see Figure 1. The aforementioned substorm-produced seed

population of electrons in the energy range 100 keV to 300 keV have approximately

circular drift paths within the region 3 ≤ L ≤ 9, and consequently will traverse the

regions of enhanced whistler-mode chorus and enhanced EMIC waves. Speciﬁcally,

in this paper we shall model the acceleration of electrons during the storm recovery

phase by means of second-order Fermi (or stochastic gyroresonant) acceleration by weak

whistler-mode turbulence. In a standard quasi-linear formulation, we construct a kinetic

equation for the evolution of the electron energy distribution function. The equation

contains an energy diﬀusion coeﬃcient due to resonant whistler-mode wave/electron

interaction, and an electron loss term due to pitch-angle scattering by both the

whistler-mode and EMIC waves. We should point out here that the data from the Solar,

Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) satellite [Nakamura et

al., 1995; Li et al., 1997a; Nakamura, 1998] show that bursty electron precipitation

occurs as the electron ﬂux increases during the storm recovery phase. Such precipitation,

together with the existence of an abundant supply of storm-produced lower-energy seed

electrons [Li et al., 1997a; Baker et al., 1998] are supportive of the model constructed

in this paper. The model is presented in detail in Section 2, and numerical solutions are

presented in Section 3. The solutions are compared with data on the electron energy

distribution of high energy (300 – 2000 keV) electrons at geosynchronous orbit. We ﬁnd

that stochastic gyroresonant acceleration by whistler-mode waves can indeed accelerate

substorm-produced seed electrons in the inner magnetosphere to generate high-energy

electron spectra of the type observed, following continuous injection of seed electrons

over a timescale of several days. Speciﬁc predictions of the model depend, of course, on

the values taken for the model parameters. In Section 4 we brieﬂy assess our ﬁndings

7

and state our conclusions.

2. MODEL

The region to which the model constructed in this paper applies is that part of

the inner magnetosphere during storm-time that is illustrated in the idealized Figure

1, for 3 ≤ L ≤ 9. This region contains an extensive subregion of whistler-mode

Figure 1

chorus, a smaller but intense region of EMIC waves, and also contains the important

geosynchronous-orbit region near L=6.6. Figure 1 is a simpliﬁed version of Figure 7

of Summers et al.

[1998], which itself was constructed on the basis of observations

and relevant theory [Cornwall et al., 1970; Perraut et al., 1976; Koons and Roeder,

1990; Parrot and Gaye, 1994; Tsurutani and Smith, 1974, 1977; Kozyra et al.,

1997; Jordanova et al., 1997]. We assume that geomagnetic storm activity produces a

seed population of electrons of energy ≈ 100 keV as a source for the region speciﬁed

in Figure 1. We are not concerned in this paper with the precise means (transport,

original source location, etc.) by which the source is supplied. According to standard

particle drift theory [e.g., Wolf, 1995], the drift motion of “hot” (e.g., 100 keV) electrons

close to the Earth is dominated by gradient drift, with the result that electrons

execute approximately circular drift trajectories eastward about the Earth. Thus, the

storm-supplied source electrons constitute a quasi-trapped population traversing the

whistler-mode and EMIC wave subregions illustrated in Figure 1. While executing the

eastward drift, the electrons gyrate about the ﬁeld lines and ‘bounce’ between mirror

points, during which time they also undergo both energy and pitch-angle diﬀusion, as

a result of their interaction with the whistler-mode chorus and EMIC waves. We shall

assume that the pitch-angle scattering rate is much greater than the energy diﬀusion

rate (see Appendix A), so that the electron distribution will be nearly isotropic. Further,

8

we shall take account of pitch-angle diﬀusion of electrons into the loss-cone and their

subsequent precipitation into the atmosphere, by characterizing their loss from the

system by an escape time Tesc. The kinetic or Fokker-Planck equation describing the

evolution in time t of the electron energy distribution function f (E, t) can be written as

electron rest mass, and c is the speed of light; f (E, t)dE is the number of particles per

unit volume in the interval dE; D(E) is the energy diﬀusion coeﬃcient due to resonant

interaction of the electrons with whistler-mode turbulence; A(E) is the systematic

acceleration rate due to the whistler-mode turbulence; |

˙EL | is the energy loss rate

due to processes not directly related to stochastic acceleration, namely, here assumed

to be Coulomb collisions and synchrotron radiation; Tesc is the mean escape time of

particles out of the system due to pitch-angle scattering by both whistler-mode and

EMIC waves; and the source term S(E, t) represents the rate of particle injection into

the inner magnetospheric region speciﬁed in Figure 1, as a result of storm activity.

Equation (1) is not the standard form of Fokker-Planck equation employed in space

physics, and so we give a brief account of its derivation in the Appendix. Detailed data

on the whistler-mode chorus during storm-time are unfortunately not available. In fact,

insuﬃcient information is known about the energy spectrum of the turbulence in many

space physics situations. While whistler-mode chorus emissions are normally considered

to be discrete during geomagnetically quiet times [Anderson and Kurth, 1989], it is

here assumed that during geomagnetic storms the concomitant, enhanced whistler-mode

turbulence can be considered quasi-continuous. Speciﬁcally, a simplifying assumption is

made that the whistler-mode turbulence is isotropic, homogeneous, stationary, and has

a power-law spectral energy density distribution in wavenumber k, with spectral index

q; speciﬁcally, the spectral energy density is assumed to take the form,

quasi-linear diﬀusion formulation adopted in this paper, the whistler-mode turbulence

is weak, i.e., comprises small-amplitude magnetic and electric wave ﬁelds. Momentum

diﬀusion coeﬃcients corresponding to whistler-mode waves have been obtained by

various authors. We calculate the Fokker-Planck coeﬃcients D(E) and A(E) from (A8)

using the whistler-mode diﬀusion coeﬃcients Dp derived by Hamilton and Petrosian

[1992] (for 2 < q ≤ 4), and Schlickeiser [1997] (for 1 < q < 2) for parallel wave

propagation. The results are

α deﬁned in (10) is identical to the parameter α used by Summers et al. [1998]. We

note, in particular, as should indeed be the case, that since the kinetic energy variable

E is dimensionless, the dimension of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D equals the dimension of
the parameter D0 (or D0) equals [time]−1. For deﬁniteness, in (5) and (8) we set

kmin = Ωp/(cβA),

[e.g., Hamilton and Petrosian, 1992], where Ωp = eB0/(mpc) is the proton gyrofrequency.

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the equation (12) is the energy loss rate due

to Coulomb collisions, given by Melrose [1980], and the second term the energy loss

rate due to synchrotron radiation, given by Blumenthal and Gould [1970]. In (12), the
particle number density N0 is in cm−3, the magnetic ﬁeld strength B0 is in gauss, and
˙EL | is in sec−1.

|

We note that there are potentially four inﬂuential parameters in the model: the

parameter α deﬁned by (10), the spectral index q, the turbulent wave power parameter

R, and the mean particle escape-time Tesc. The value of the parameter α depends on

the values taken for the particle density N0 and the ambient magnetic ﬁeld strength

B0. We shall discuss Tesc, which we regard as an adjustable parameter, and the particle

source function S below. The diﬀusion parameters D0 and D0 occurring in expressions

(3) and (6) for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D are measures of the rate of energy diﬀusion,
and D−1

0 are measures of the time scale for particle acceleration. Substituting the

0 , D−1

result (11) for kmin into equations (5) and (8), we ﬁnd that D0 and D0 are given by

Corresponding to the Kolmogorov turbulent spectrum (q = 5/3), the function JW is of

order unity. As an idealized assumption, we regard the Kolmogorov spectrum as the

representative spectrum over the range 1 < q < 2, and we henceforth set q = 5/3 and

Since, from (10), the parameter α is inversely proportional to the particle number

density N0, it follows from (13) and (14) that D0 and D0 increase as N0 decreases. This

agrees with the conclusions of Summers et al. [1998] who found by constructing resonant

diﬀusion curves in velocity space that energy diﬀusion becomes more pronounced with

increasing α (or decreasing N0). As expected, the values of D0 and D0 also increase as

the turbulent spectral energy density ratio R increases. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd from (13)

and (14) that D0 and D0 depend on the plasma parameters N0 and B0, and the wave

amplitude ∆B as follows:

for 2 < q ≤ 4;

D0 ∝ B(4−q)

12

for 1 < q < 2.

In this paper, we set N0 = 10 cm−3 as the particle number density representative

of the inner magnetosphere (3 ≤ L ≤ 9) outside the plasmasphere. It could be argued

that such a value may be too high for the background plasma outside the plasmasphere.

However, since from (15) and (16) it is clear that the acceleration process becomes
more eﬃcient as N0 decreases, we ﬁnd it useful to adopt N0 = 10 cm−3 as a generic

conservative value. We comment further on this assumption below. We use the
equatorial (dipole) magnetic ﬁeld value B0 = 3.12 × 10−5/L3 T. Corresponding values

of B0 and the above-deﬁned parameters α and βA at the locations L = 3, 4, · · ·, 9 are
given in Table 1. In Figure 2, we plot the energy diﬀusion parameter D0 (sec−1) as a

Figure 2

function of the spectral index q in the range 2 < q < 4 at each of the locations L = 3, 4,

5. At each L-value, we calculate D0 for the speciﬁed wave amplitudes ∆B = 75 pT, 100

pT, 300 pT, and 1 nT ( which correspond to the indicated values of R in the diagrams).
Lines indicating the time scales D−1
0

for particle acceleration corresponding to 1 hour,

1/2 day, and 1 day are shown in each diagram. As can be observed from the curves in

Figure 2, the value of D0 is particularly sensitive to the value of q as q approaches 2.

In fact, formally from (13) we have the result D0 → ∞, as q → 2, which is obviously

undesirable physically, but which is a consequence of the quasi-linear diﬀusion formalism

we have adopted in this paper. It is evident from Figure 2 that, at any given L-value, as

the value of q decreases, the value of D0 increases, and hence the time scale for particle

acceleration decreases. In addition, it can be observed that for a given value of q, as

L decreases, the value of D0 likewise increases; this property also follows from relation

(15). Thus, for q in the range 2 < q < 4, shorter acceleration times are favoured by

smaller value of q, small values of L, and (of course) larger values of the wave amplitude

∆B. Corresponding to the Kolmogorov spectrum (q = 5/3), we show in Figure 3 the
diﬀusion parameter D0 (sec−1) as a function of ∆B (pT) at the locations L = 3, 4, 5.

Figure 3

Again, it is clear from the ﬁgure that shorter acceleration times are favoured by smaller

values of L and larger values of ∆B; this property similarly follows from (16).

In Figure 4, we plot the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D (sec−1) as a function of the particle Figure 4

kinetic energy E (MeV), as given by (3), (6), (13) and (14), for the ﬁxed wave amplitude
∆B = 1 nT, and N0 = 10 cm−3. The curves are constructed for values of the spectral

index q = 5/3, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4, at each of the locations, L = 3, 4, 5. The diﬀusion

coeﬃcient D is clearly an increasing function of energy E. In general, for a given value

of E, though not at all values, D can also be seen to increase as q decreases.

According to the standard quasi-linear theory of resonant interaction of electrons

with whistler-mode turbulence [e.g., Melrose, 1986], in order for electrons to resonate

with whistlers, the condition,

γβ ≥ (mp/me)1/2βA

must be satisﬁed; β = v/c where v is the particle speed, c is the speed of light, γ is the

Lorentz factor, and βA = vA/c is the Alfv´en speed parameter deﬁned above. Making use

of relativistic relations given in (A6), we ﬁnd that (17) can be expressed in the form

which, in turn, by using the parameter α deﬁned in (10), can be reduced to

E(E + 2) ≥ (mp/me)β2
A

E ≥ Ec,

Ec = (1 + α)1/2 − 1.

where Ec is the critical energy given by

13

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

The value of the parameter α depends on the values of the particle number density

N0 and magnetic ﬁeld B0. Values of the critical energy Ec are given in Table 1 at the Table 1
locations L = 3, 4, · · ·, 9, for N0 = 10 cm−3; the values for L = 3, 4, 5 correspond

respectively to the energy cut-oﬀ values in the upper, middle, and lower diagrams in

Figure 4.

3. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Prior to consideration of the solution of the kinetic equation (1) for the electron

energy distribution function f (E, t), we must specify the source function S(E, t) which

represents storm-produced seed electrons. We shall assume that the source function can

be represented by a standard relativistic Maxwellian distribution, namely,

S = S0[µ/K2(µ)](E + 1)[E(E + 2)]1/2e−µ(E+1)

where

µ = mec2/(kBTs)

and Ts represents the temperature of the distribution; K2(µ) is a modiﬁed Bessel

function of the second kind of argument µ, and kB is Boltzmann’s constant. It can be

shown that

SdE = S0, so that the parameter S0 represents the total number of source

electrons per unit volume per unit time.

R

It is clearly important both to calibrate and test our model, as far as is possible

at the present time, by making use of available observational data. The study by

Cayton et al. [1989] appears best-suited to these purposes. Cayton et al. [1989] derived

energy distribution functions from energetic (30 – 2000 keV) electron ﬂuxes observed

simultaneously by three satellites in geosynchronous orbit throughout the year 1986.

It was found that the energetic electron population can be resolved into two distinct

relativistic Maxwellian components, each parameterized by a temperature and a density:

a lower energy (30 – 300 keV) “soft” electron distribution with temperature Ts ≈ 25
keV and number density Ns ≈ 5 × 10−3 cm−3; and a higher energy (300 – 2000 keV)

“hard” electron distribution with temperature Th ≈ 200 keV and number density
Nh ≈ 10−4cm−3. The “soft” component is charaterized by intense substorm-related

injections and by strong temporal variations. Accordingly, and in agreement with a

suggested interpretation by Cayton et al. [1989], we shall regard this “soft” component

as comprising the electron seed population. Thus, we shall identify the temperature Ts

15

associated with the Maxwellian source distribution (21) – (22) as the aforementioned

temperature of the “soft” electron component. Cayton et al. [1989] found that the value

of Th shows little change on the substorm (hourly) time scale, while Nh decreases during

substorms. We shall regard the “hard” electron distribution as precisely the highly

energetic (“killer”) electron distribution that we are trying to model as a (steady-state)

solution of the kinetic equation (1) with the steady Maxwellian source (21) – (22).

We solve equation (1) for the energetic electron distribution f (E, t) by the Crank-

Nicholson implicit diﬀerencing scheme. The method is well suited to time-dependent

Fokker-Planck equations, and we refer the reader to Hamilton et al. [1990] and Park

and Petrosian [1996] for full details. Since we are concerned with the generation of

a highly-energetic electron distribution, we assume that there are no such energetic

particles initially, i.e.,

f (E, 0) = 0,

E > Es,

(23)

where Es = 1/µ is the thermal energy associated with the source distribution (21) –

(22). We further assume that, subject to continuous injection of the seed electrons

(given by (21) – (22)), the evolving distribution maintains a maximum at E = Es for all

time, i.e., we take the inner boundary condition as

∂f (E, t)
∂E

= 0,

E = Es.

(24)

Finally, for the outer boundary condition we require that the distribution function tend

to zero for large values of E for all time, so we set

f (E, t) = 0,

E > E0

(25)

where E0 is a speciﬁed upper value of E (in practice, we ﬁx E0 = 2 × 104 MeV).

Having constructed the evolving electron distribution subject to the above conditions, we

thereby obtain the resulting steady-state distribution f (E) which we ﬁt to a relativistic

Maxwellian distribution, i.e., we carry out the linear ﬁt,

with

and

log10

f (E)/{(E + 1)[E(E + 2)]1/2}

b = −λ log10 e,

λ = mec2/(kBTh),

(26)

(27)

(28)

where Th and Nh represent respectively the temperature and number density of the

steady-state distribution (to be compared with the above values associated with the

“hard” electron distribution); and K2(λ) is a modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind

of argument λ. For a given steady-state solution, the parameters a and b are determined

by a linear regression comprising a minimization of a chi-square goodness-of-ﬁt merit

function [Press et al., 1992]. Having thus obtained values for a and b, we then calculate

Th and Nh from (27) and (28).

Representative numerical solutions of the model presented in this paper are shown

in Figures 5, 6, and 7, with corresponding results given respectively in Tables 2, 3,
and 4. In all cases we set the background number density N0 = 10 cm−3, and the

Figures 5, 6

source electron temperature Ts = 25 keV (giving µ = 20.44 from (22)), the latter value

Tables 2, 3

being equal to the estimate by Cayton et al. [1989] for the temperature of the “soft”

7

4

electron distribution. The scheme and rationale for setting the remaining parameters

is as follows. Firstly, we set L, which ﬁxes the value of the background magnetic

ﬁeld B0. Secondly, we set the average wave-amplitude ∆B and the spectral index q;

these values are chosen to yield a value of the diﬀusion parameter D0 (or D0) that is

expected to produce a steady-state (equilibrium) distribution function after several

days of source injection. Whistler-mode “chorus” wave amplitudes have been reported

in the range 1 – 100 pT [Burtis and Helliwell, 1975], with Parrot and Gaye [1994]

ﬁnding that during more intense periods of magnetic activity wave amplitudes can

17

approach ∆B = 1 nT. Amplitudes of whistlers associated mainly with hiss, with values

of 100 pT or more, have also been reported by Smith et al. [1974] during a typical

storm recovery phase. In Table 1, corresponding to a background number density of
N0 = 10 cm−3, we present the wave amplitudes ∆B (pT) expected to yield a high

energy “hard” electron distribution after a few days of seed electron injection as a result

of substorm activity. These required amplitudes depend on the value of L and q (as well

as N0). For q = 5/3, and for the inner region 3 ≤ L ≤ 5, the values of ∆B are in the

range 75 – 400 pT, which are realistic though in the higher range of observations. As

pointed out in Section 2, the process of gyroresonant stochastic acceleration becomes
more eﬃcient with decreasing background plasma density. While N0 = 10 cm−3 can

be regarded as a representative value for the background plasma density outside the
plasmasphere in certain conditions, it is also true that at other times N0 = 1 cm−3 is a
more representative value. Using (15), we calculate that if we set N0 = 1 cm−3, then,

for 3 ≤ L ≤ 5, the required ∆B-values are in the range 13 – 72 pT, if q = 5/3, and in

the range 35 – 316 pT, if 2.5 ≤ q ≤ 3. Having set values for N0, Ts, L, q, and ∆B, we

next specify the mean particle escape time Tesc. In fact, since a value for Tesc is not

precisely known, we treat Tesc as an adjustable parameter and run the cases 1/(D0Tesc)

(or 1/(D0Tesc)) = 0, 1, 2, 5, 10. In Figure 5 (left) we show steady-state solutions for

the electron energy distribution function f (E) for the case L = 3, q = 5/3, ∆B = 75

pT. The source strength S0 has been chosen so as to produce a model solution that

best agrees with the “hard” electron distribution of Cayton et al. [1989]. In order to

achieve this, for each steady-state solution the linear ﬁt (26) – (28) to a relativistic

Maxwellian distribution is carried out. The corresponding results are shown in Figure

5 (right) and Table 2. It is found that the temperature Th associated with a particular

steady-state solution, as given by the parameter b (or the slope of the constructed line),

is largely determined by the value of Tesc, while the number density Nh, which is then

given by the parameter a (or the vertical intercept of the line) is largely determined by

18

the value of S0. The results in Table 2, for which S0 = 1.5 × 10−6 cm−3sec−1, indicate
a best agreement with the empirically-derived values of Nh ≈ 10−4 cm−3 and Th = 200

keV, when Tesc ≈ 1/2 day, the corresponding time for the formation of the steady-state

solution being TEQ ≈ 4 days. A precise, physically representative value for the mean

particle escape time Tesc is diﬃcult to determine a priori since Tesc relates to scattering

losses of electrons due to both whistler-mode and EMIC waves. However, on the basis

of estimates of timescales for strong diﬀusion scattering loss, it appears that Tesc is of

the order of hours and so Tesc ≈ 1/2 day is not an unreasonable value. We relate TEQ to

the time taken after the initiation of a storm for ﬂuxes of relativistic electrons to peak

(see Section 1), which is observed to be several days. Thus, we favour solutions of the

present model for which TEQ = 1 – 5 days, with TEQ ≈ 4 days possibly the optimal

value.

In Figure 6 and Table 3 we show the corresponding results for the case N0 = 10
cm−3, L = 6.6, q = 2.5, ∆B = 800 pT, while in Figure 7 and Table 4 we show the results
for the case N0 = 10 cm−3, L = 5, q = 3, ∆B = 1 nT. As can be seen from the tables,

for both these cases best agreement between the solutions and the “hard” electron

distribution of Cayton et al. [1989] occurs when Tesc ≈ 1/2 day, and corresponds to a

formation time TEQ = 3 – 5 days. If the background number density is taken to be
N0 = 1 cm−3, the cases shown in Figures 6 and 7 correspond respectively to values for

the wave amplitude ∆B of 190 pT and 316 pT. Figures 6 and 7 correspond to cases of

intense substorm activity during the storm recovery phase.

Taking into account the value of the wave amplitudes given in Table 2 corresponding

to N0 = 10 cm−3, and their converted values for the case N0 = 1 cm−3, we re-iterate

that the model solutions imply in particular that for a Kolmogorov turbulent wave

spectrum, sustained whistler amplitudes in the physically realistic range 13 – 72 pT can

generate a typical high energy “hard” electron distribution in the inner magnetosphere

3 ≤ L ≤ 5 within one or two days. It should also be noted that the model calculations

19

show that the acceleration mechanism considered in this paper is not eﬀective in the

region 7 ≤ L ≤ 9 since the necessary values of the whistler amplitude would be too

high (typically in excess of 1 nT). Thus, the model formulated herein has been shown

to be a viable mechanism for accelerating electrons exactly in the inner region of the

magnetosphere where the peak in electron phase space density of the highly energetic

electrons is observed to occur [e.g., Selesnick and Blake, 1997b].

A requirement of the model presented here is enhanced whistler-mode chorus

lasting for a period of at least one or two days. Geomagnetic conditions during which

such a requirement is particularly well satisﬁed occur during the descending phase of the

solar cycle when the Earth’s magnetosphere can be impacted by a high-speed solar wind

stream following a magnetic ﬁeld build-up known as a Corotating Interaction Region

(CIR). CIRs cause small and moderate magnetic storms, but not major storms. Since

the Earth can be embedded in the associated high-speed stream for days to weeks there

are substorms for days to weeks [Tsurutani et al., 1995; Kamide et al., 1998]. Thus,

during this long-lasting recovery phase of the magnetic storm, there will be continuously

enhanced wave activity, in the form of both whistler-mode chorus and EMIC waves,

to drive the acceleration mechanism presented herein to generate the high energy (>1

MeV) electrons.

4. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, by means of quasi-linear theory and a test-particle approach, we have

formulated the model kinetic equation (1) in which the acceleration mechanism is due to

gyroresonant interaction between electrons and whistler-mode turbulence, corresponding

to parallel wave propagation. The essential purpose of the study has been to apply

equation (1) to the Earth’s inner magnetosphere in order to test the hypothesis that

storm-enhanced whistler-mode chorus can accelerate lower-energy substorm-produced

seed electrons to relativistic (> 1 MeV) energies over a period of a few days. Our

20

conclusions are as follows:

1. Based on the model calculations in this paper, it is entirely possible for enhanced

whistler-mode chorus to generate the observed increases in relativistic (> 1

MeV) “killer” electrons during the storm recovery after a period of several days,
so long as the waves are suﬃciently strong. If N0 = 10 cm−3 is taken to be

the background plasma number density outside the plasmasphere, the typical

average wave-amplitudes required for a Kolmogorov spectrum are in the range
∆B = 75 – 400 pT, dependent on the location L. If N0 = 1 cm−3, the required

wave-amplitudes are in range 13 - 72 pT.

2. Energetic electron spectra of the model solutions do not follow a simple power law

in energy. For certain sets of parameters, we ﬁnd that solutions can be well ﬁtted

to the relativistic Maxwellian distribution empirically constructed by Cayton et

al.

[1989] to represent the higher energy (300 keV – 2 MeV) “hard” electron

population at geosynchronous orbit. We note the recent analysis by Freeman et al.

[1998] of the November 3 – 4, 1993 storm, in which electrons from about 100 keV to

1.5 MeV were characterized by a power law spectrum. Evidently, optimal ﬁtting of

empirical electron spectra to power-law, Maxwellian, or other types of distribution

can depend on the energy range prescribed and the event under consideration. In

connection with electron power-law energy spectra, Ma and Summers [1998] have

shown that such spectra can be produced by whistler-mode turbulence, although

it is questionable whether the necessary conditions established in their theoretical

study can be satisﬁed in the Earth’s magnetosphere.

3. It is unlikely that any single physical mechanism of electron acceleration can

fully account for relativistic electron enhancements occurring during the recovery

phase of magnetic storms, not least because various types of energetic electron

event have been observed [e.g., Baker et al., 1997, 1998; Reeves, 1998b; Reeves et

21

al., 1998]. Rapid energetic electron ﬂux enhancements taking place over minutes

have been associated with inductive electric ﬁelds [e.g., Li et al., 1993], while

enhancements occurring over tens of minutes or a few hours have been linked

to ULF pulsations [e.g., Rostoker et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1999]. The gradual

acceleration process (occurring over a few days) formulated in this paper is not

intended to apply to such energetic electron events which typically result from

major storms. However, small and moderate magnetic storms associated with

Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) characteristically have long recovery phases

and attendant substorms for days to weeks [Tsurutani et al., 1995; Kamide et al.,

1998]. Since these substorms produce enhanced whistler-mode chorus (and EMIC

waves) over (at least) several days, the necessary conditions for the eﬀectiveness

of the mechanism presented in this paper are satisﬁed. Hence, for these types of

storm, and possibly others, when average wave-amplitudes are suﬃciently large,

the present study shows that, in conjunction with pitch-angle scattering by EMIC

waves, the mechanism of stochastic acceleration by whistler-mode turbulence is a

serious candidate for explaining the generation of “killer electrons”.

We consider energetic charged particles in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, with

(A1)

Equation (A1), called a kinetic or diﬀusion or Fokker-Planck equation, is derived by

expanding a collisionless Boltzmann equation for the particle distribution function

22

to second order in perturbed quantities, and ensemble-averaging over the statistical

properties of the plasma waves in accordance with quasi-linear theory. Among the

early authors to carry out this procedure were Kennel and Engelmann [1966], Hall and

Sturrock [1967], and Lerche [1968]; see also Melrose [1980], Schlickeiser [1989], and

Steinacker and Miller [1992], and references therein. In (A1), p is the relativistic unit

momentum given by p = γv/c, where v is the particle speed, and γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2 is

the Lorentz factor, with c the speed of light; t is time; µ is the cosine of the pitch angle;

˙EL is an energy loss term due to processes not directly associated with gyro-resonant

wave-particle interactions; and Q(p, t) is a source term. The Fokker-Planck or diﬀusion

coeﬃcients Dpp, Dpµ, Dµp, and Dµµ depend on the properties of the wave turbulence,

viz., the wave mode and polarization, the angle of wave propagation to the ambient

magnetic ﬁeld, and the power spectrum, including the ratio of the turbulent wave

energy to the background magnetic energy. These coeﬃcients have been given both

in general form, and speciﬁc form, for various particular wave modes, by a number

of authors, e.g., Melrose [1980], Schlickeiser [1989], Steinacker and Miller [1992], and

Hamilton and Petrosian [1992]. It is not necessary here to derive equation (A1), which

requires considerable algebra, or to provide general expressions for the coeﬃcients

Dpp, Dpµ = Dµp, and Dµµ. We shall assume that the rate of pitch-angle scattering is

much larger than the rate of energy diﬀusion (and the rate of the particle escape from

the system). Such an assumption is reasonable based on an analysis of time scales

associated with resonant interaction of electrons with whistler-mode waves, e.g., see

Melrose [1980] and the discussion by Hamilton and Petrosian [1992]. Equivalently,
deﬁning the time scales Tµµ = D−1

µp , Tpp = p2D−1

µµ , Tµp = pD−1

pp , and the escape time Tesc,

we assume that Tµµ ≪ Tpp, Tµµ ≪ Tµp, and Tµµ ≪ Tesc. Then the particle distribution

function can be assumed to be isotropic, and the pitch angle can be eliminated from the

problem by integrating (A1) with respect to µ [e.g., see Schlickeiser, 1989; Steinacker

and Miller, 1992]. Writing

F (p, t) =

and representing the scattering loss of particles by pitch angle diﬀusion by means of a

The form of equation (A7) is actually the Fokker-Planck form of equation for a particle

distribution function as originally presented by Chandrasekhar [1943] for particles in

stochastic motion. Stochastic acceleration of electrons in solar ﬂares has been treated

using diﬀerent versions of (A7), e.g., see Ramaty [1979], Petrosian [1994], and Park et

al. [1997].

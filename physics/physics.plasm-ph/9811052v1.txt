The dynamical structure factor of a Coulomb crystal of
ions is calculated at arbitrary temperature below the melt-
ing point taking into account multi-phonon processes in the
harmonic approximation. In a strongly coupled Coulomb ion
liquid, the static structure factor is split into two parts, a
Bragg-diﬀraction-like one, describing incipient long-range or-
der structures, and an inelastic part corresponding to thermal
ion density ﬂuctuations. It is assumed that the diﬀraction-
like scattering does not lead to the electron relaxation in the
liquid phase. This assumption, together with the inclusion
of multi-phonon processes in the crystalline phase, eliminates
large discontinuities of the transport coeﬃcients (jumps of the
thermal and electric conductivities, as well as shear viscosity,
reported previously) at a melting point.

We consider a strongly coupled Coulomb plasma
(SCCP) of ions immersed in a nearly uniform charge-
compensating electron gas. The ions may be disordered
(liquid phase) or arranged in a crystalline lattice. The
energetically favorable body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice,
appears at Γ > Γm ≈ 172 [1], where Γ = (Ze)2/(aT )
is the ion-coupling parameter, T is the temperature,
a = (4πni/3)−1/3, and ni is the ion number density.

Many astrophysical objects (interiors of white dwarfs,
massive stars, and giant planets; envelopes of neutron
stars) are made of such a plasma. Its kinetic properties
required for various applications are determined mainly
by electron-ion (ei) scattering. A general framework for
calculation of these transport properties has been de-
scribed in [2]. Numerous calculations (e.g., [3–7]), done
under additional assumption of strong electron degener-
acy, predict large (a factor of 3–4) discontinuities of the
electric and thermal conductivities at the melting point.
In contrast, the thermodynamic quantities in the liquid
and solid phases, determined solely by ions, are very sim-
ilar near Γ = Γm (e.g., [8,1]). This suggests that prop-
erties of the ion system serving as a main scatterer for
electrons should vary smoothly through the melting tran-
sition. In this Letter, we propose a modiﬁcation of the
transport theory which removes large jumps of the trans-
port coeﬃcients.

¯hq = p′ − p, ¯hω = ǫ′ − ǫ is the diﬀerence between ﬁnal
and initial electron energies, and Uq,σ′σ is the matrix ele-
ment of the operator of elementary ei interaction. S(q, ω)
is the dynamical structure factor of the plasma, the most
important quantity of the theory. In the liquid regime,
ˆρ(x, t) is the operator of the charge density in units of
Z|e|: ˆρ(x, t) = ˆnI(x, t) − ni, where ˆnI(x, t) is the ion den-
sity operator and ni = ne/Z takes account of the com-
pensating electron background with the electron density

(where Ri is a lattice vector), i.e. the operator of ﬂuctu-
ations of the charge density.

where ui is an ion displacement from Ri. Expanding ui

The Bragg scattering of electrons results in the energy
band structure of the electron Bloch states, but does not
contribute to the ei collision integral in the kinetic equa-
tion [2]. Indeed, this scattering occurs at the boundaries
of the Brillouin zones and translates an electron from one
zone to another. The transition requires change of the
electron energy by the value of the interband gap; thus
another particle must be involved to carry the excess en-
ergy.

Therefore only the inelastic part of the structure factor
contributes to the collision integral. The inelastic part
can be found by the same technique [9]:

where αijν ≡ exp[ik · (Ri − Rj) − iωνt]. The summa-
tion over i, j yields the delta function which removes one
summation over k (included in the sums over ν). Thus
we have n sums over s and n − 1 sums over k in each nth
term of Eq. (6).

Retaining the ﬁrst term n = 1, we recover the one-
phonon approximation employed in previous works (e.g.,
[2–6]). Our point is that this approximation fails near the
melting point. In fact, the contribution of the n-phonon
processes (nth term) at T above the Debye temperature
can be estimated as (qrT )2n/n! ∼ (kF rT )2n/n!, where

h. . .iph denotes averaging over phonon spectrum (e.g., [6])
in the harmonic-lattice approximation. For instance, for
Fe plasma at Γ ≈ Γm we obtain a typical value of n ∼
(kF rT )2 ≈ 3, which is not small.

p/ω2

An important diﬀerence of astrophysical Coulomb
crystals from the terrestrial metals is that the umklapp
processes dominate the scattering, because the equivalent
radius of the Brillouin zone qB = (6π2ni)1/3 is smaller
than typical momentum transfers q ∼ kF . For q >
s(q · eν)2f (ων) →
qB one can approximately replace
q2hf (ων)iph [10]. Then the remaining summations in Eq.
(6) are done explicitly:

The static structure factor is deﬁned as S(q) =
+∞
−∞ S(q, ω) dω = S(q, 0). Thus the inelastic contribu-
tion to S(q) in the solid is given by setting t = 0 in
R
Eq. (7), which yields S′′

sol(q) = 1 − e−2W .

Let us turn to the liquid phase. Numerical simula-
tions by diﬀerent authors show the appearance of incip-
ient long-range order at Γ ≫ 1. For example, Schmidt
et al. [11] observed a shear mode at Γ > 100 in their
molecular-dynamics experiment along with the familiar
longitudinal ion plasmon. We have veriﬁed that the spec-
trum of these modes can be described by the phonon
spectrum averaged over orientations of a crystal. Al-
though the long-range order does not persist forever, it
may be well preserved during typical electron scattering
time. Thus a temporary electron band structure emerges,
and an associated elastic scattering does not contribute
to the conduction (as in solid). This is in line with Ed-
wards’s [12] argument that one should deal with a local
disorder “observed” by an electron along its mean free
path, rather than with the global disorder. Therefore we
suggest to subtract the elastic contribution from the total
static structure factor Sliq(q) in the liquid (e.g., [13,14]).
Since in the liquid an electron couples directly to the ion
number density, the elastic part must have the form [9]

liq(q) = e−2W (2π)3ni
S′

δ(q − G).

(8)

G6=0
X

Then the “inelastic” part which determines the trans-
port properties is S′′
liq(q) = Sliq(q) − S′
liq(q). There may
be various types of periodic structures in this regime,
but they are very similar and we can use the bcc lat-
tice. We have checked that the result is almost the same
for face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed
(hcp) lattices.

At this stage we need to specify the matrix element
of the elementary ei interaction Uq,σ′σ. Assuming the
Coulomb potential screened by the static polarization of
ideal, relativistic, strongly degenerate (p ≈ p′ ≈ ¯hkF )
electrons, we obtain

analytically. The remaining numerical integration over

Retaining the term ∝ q2 in the expansion of K(q, T, t),
we recover the standard one-phonon approximation [3–6].
Figures 1 and 2 show temperature dependence of the
electric and thermal conductivities for carbon plasma at
density 104 g cm−3 and for iron plasma at 108 g cm−3, re-
spectively, calculated in the Born approximation. In spite
of large diﬀerences in densities and chemical elements,
the ﬁgures are fairly similar. Dashes show the traditional
results calculated with the full structure factor Sliq(q) in
ion liquid [3,7] and in the one-phonon approximation [4,6]
for bcc crystal (notice that the results of ref. [6] for fcc
crystals are in error; actually, they are very similar to
those for bcc). One can see strong jumps of κ and σ at
the melting point Γm = 172. Solid lines are the present
results in the solid phase (including multi-phonon pro-
cesses), while dots show the present results in the liquid
obtained using the analytic ﬁts for the static structure
factor Sliq(q) at Γ ≤ 225 [14] by subtracting the long-
range correlations (see above). For illustration (as sug-
gested by H.E. DeWitt), we have extended the improved
results in liquid by shifting artiﬁcially the melting point
to lower T (to Γ = 225, considering thus supercooled
liquid) and the improved results in solid by shifting the
melting to higher T (lower Γ, superheated crystal). The
curves for liquid and solid ions match one another quite
well, and the jumps at the melting point actually disap-
pear. In a wide temperature range the improved curves
for liquid and solid almost coincide. We have veriﬁed
that the same is true for all transport coeﬃcients (in-
cluding shear viscosity) in wide range of densities for a
number of chemical elements. Thus one can observe that
electron transport properties in SCCP of ions appear to
be fairly insensitive to the state of SCCP (liquid or solid,
bcc or other crystals). This should be taken into account
in various astrophysical applications, for instance, in cal-
culating the temperature growth from the surface into in-
terior of the isolated neutron stars important for theories
of neutron star cooling [16,7]. The thermal conductivity
of neutron-star envelopes to be reconsidered lies exactly
in the “sensitivity strip” [16] which strongly aﬀects the
temperature proﬁles and neutron-star cooling.

and bcc crystal [4,6] for Γm = 172. Solid line is the present
multi-phonon calculation in solid, extended artiﬁcially to high
T ; dots show the present calculation with reduced structure
factor in liquid at Γ ≤ 225. Vertical dotted lines correspond

Abstract

Generalized action invariants are identiﬁed for various models of

drift wave turbulence in the presence of the mean shear ﬂow.

It is

shown that the wave kinetic equation describing the interaction of

the small scale turbulence and large scale shear ﬂow can be naturally

writen in terms of these invariants. Unlike the wave energy, which is

conserved as a sum of small- and large- scale components, the gener-

alized action invariant is shown to correspond to a quantity which is

conserved for the small scale component alone. This invariant can be

used to construct canonical variables leading to a diﬀerent deﬁnition

of the wave action ( as compared to the case without shear ﬂow). It

is suggested that these new canonical action variables form a natu-

1

ral basis for the description of the drift wave turbulence with a mean

shear ﬂow.

The dynamics of the small scale turbulence in the presence of a mean

shear ﬂow is a problem of a great interest for plasmas and geostrophic ﬂuids.

It is believed that the nonlinear energy transfer from small to large length

scale component (inverse cascade [1]) is a cause of a spontaneous generation

and sustainment of coherent large structures, e.g. zonal ﬂows in atmospheres,

ocean and plasmas [2]. In the few past years it has been suggested [3, 4, 5,

6, 7, 8, 9, 10] that the large scale ﬂow band structures (zonal ﬂows) play

an important role in regulating and suppressing the anomalous transport in

magnetic conﬁnement systems.

In the simplest form, the generation of plasma ﬂow by turbulence can be

described by the energy conservation relation (Poynting theorem) averaged

over small scale ﬂuctuations [9]. A generalization of this approach is a WKB

type wave kinetic equation for the quanta density of small scale ﬂuctuations

that is conserved along the rays. This method was originally proposed in

Ref. 11 to describe the interaction of high frequency plasmons (Langmuir

waves) with low frequency ion sound perturbations. It is widely used also in

general ﬂuid dynamics [12].

In studies of drift wave dynamics, it has been naturally assumed [13, 14]

that the relevant quantity that is conserved in the presence of slow variations

is the drift-wave action density. It is well known [15], that the standard wave

2

action variables Ck associated with the number of wave quanta nk, nk =

|Ck|2 = Ek/ωk, where Ek is the wave energy, and ωk is the wave frequency,

is a basis for Hamiltonian form of the wave-wave interaction equations. It

has been noted in Refs. 16,17 that the normal variables used to describe

self-interaction between small scale ﬂuctuations without the shear ﬂow are

modiﬁed by the ﬂow and may not be suitable for a system with a mean

ﬂow. Thus, in the presence of a shear ﬂow a new form of canonical variables

and associated action invariant have to be identiﬁed. On other hand, it has

been pointed[18] that the conserved action-like quantity (pseudo-action) is

diﬀerent from the usual deﬁnition of the wave action deﬁned as the ratio

of the wave energy to the wave frequency. The latter deﬁnition is also fails

when there are no oscillating eigenmodes such as in ideal ﬂuid, so that an

alternative deﬁnition of the action-like integral is required[19].

It is important to realize that the natural form of the three-wave in-

teraction equations for the drift-waves does not have Hamiltonian structure

[20].These equations can be transformed, however, to a Hamiltonian form

via an asymptotic variable transformation. Such a tranformation yielding a

Hamiltonian form for the drift and Rossby waves has been found in Refs.

20,21. There are several possible forms for such a transformation. In Refs.

17,20,21 it is based on the conserved energy integral that leads to the stan-

dard deﬁnition of the wave action. For drift-wave+zonal ﬂow systems small

scales are modulated by larger scale shear ﬂows so that energy in the small

3

scale component is not conserved. Thus, the canonical Hamiltonian variables

constructed from energy conservation are not suitable for description of the

drift waves in the presence of a mean ﬂow.

In this paper, we derive the WKB type wave kinetic equation that de-

scribes the conservation (along the rays) of an action like invariant of the drift

wave turbulence with slowly varying parameters due to the mean sheared

ﬂow. We demonstrate that the relevant action-like integral corresponds to

the quantity conserved for the small scale component alone. We show that

the structure of the action integral is determined by the structure of the

matrix element describing the interaction of the small scale and large scale

component. We discuss how the canonical variables corresponding to such a

pseudo-action invariant can be constructed.

The scale separation between the small scale turbulence and the large

scale motions is an essential property of drift-wave+zonal ﬂow systems that

is commonly used [12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23] to simplify the analysis. Though,

the scale separation is often observed experimentally and in computer sim-

ulation, it may be less pronounced in other cases[24]. In our present paper,

we substantially rely on the multiscale expansion, so our results are valid,

strictly speaking, only in the case when there is such a scale separation. More

general approach avoiding the scale separation assumption, namely the renor-

malization group, is possible [25], but it is beyond the scope of the present

paper.

In this paper, we consider two diﬀerent models for drift waves in a magne-

tized plasma: the standard Hasegawa-Mima equation and a slab-like model

for drift waves in a sheared magnetic ﬁeld. The latter is similar to the stan-

dard Hasegawa-Mima equation with a modiﬁed plasma response to the slow

modulations of the electrostatic potential. Such slow modes correspond to

kk → 0, so that the slow part of the potential does not follow Boltzmann

distribution.

[Note that zonal ﬂows[10] (m = n = 0) are such slow modes

with kk = 0.] As a result, the convective term appears in the lowest order,

contrary to the case of the Hasegawa-Mima equation where such term is due

to the polarization drift. Appropriate equation for the drift wave dynamics

Note that both invariants (16) and (21) are diﬀerent from standard deﬁnition

of the wave action [13, 14]. The diﬀerence between two forms of the action-

like invariant (Eq. (16) and (21)) is due to a diﬀerent form of the coupling

9

matrix (Eq. (13) and Eq.(18)) describing interaction of the small and large

scale components.

The procedure that we have described above can also be used to derive

the action-like invariant for the two-dimensional motion of an incompressible

ﬂuid. In the latter case, there are no oscillating modes so that the standard

deﬁnition of the action as a ratio of the wave energy to wave frequency is not

applicable. The 2-D Euler equation has a form

where V0 is the velocity due to the mean ﬂow. This equation can be written

in the form (1) with ωk = 0 and the interaction coeﬃcient

We summarize generalized wave action integrals for diﬀerent models in

the Table I. Note that the standard expression for the drift wave action

deﬁned as the ratio of the wave energy to the wave frequency is [13, 14]

nk = |ak|2 =

(25)

where ω∗ = kθV∗. Expression (25) should be compared with the ﬁrst two

lines in the Table. It is interesting to note that generalized action invariant

10

given by Eq. (16) coincides with the standard deﬁnition of the wave action

(25) for the poloidally symmetric case when the poloidal wave vector kθ is

constant (kθ = const).

Next we consider the self-interaction between small scales in the presence

of the shear ﬂow and outline how the pseudo-action invariants can be used

to construct the canonical variables for the latter case. For illustration, we

consider the case of Hasegawa-Mima equation (17). We restore the self-

interaction term given by Wk,k1,k2

This natural form of the three-wave interaction does not have standard

Hamiltonian structure. This is reﬂected in the interaction coeﬃcients Wk,k1,k2

which do not have the required symmetry properties [15]. The only symme-

tries in Wk,k1,k2 are of the type W ∗

−k,−k1,−k2 = Wk,k1,k2 = W−k,k1,k2. Transfor-

mation of (26) to normal canonical variables ak was given in Refs. 19,20 (see

also Ref. 16). It has the form [17]

ak = gkφk +

d2k1d2k2Gk,k1,k2δ(k − k1 − k2)φk1φk2.

(28)

In new variables the interaction coeﬃcients Vk,k1,k2 are

These interaction coeﬃcients Vk,k1,k2 now have all symmetries required for

Hamiltonian systems. The function gk can be chosen in a variety of ways. The

standard approach [17, 20, 21] is to chose gk so that the energy in canonical

variables takes the form E =

d2kωkaka−k. Comparing it with the energy

integral E =

As discussed above, for the drift waves-zonal ﬂow system the energy in

the small scale component is not conserved, bur rather the total energy of

drift waves + large scale zonal ﬂows is constant. For this reason, the energy

integral of the small scale component can not be used for introduction of

canonical variables for self interaction of the small scale ﬂuctuations. Con-

trary to the energy, the integrals Nk are conserved for small scale component.

Choosing the function gk such as that the invariants (16) or (21) are in the

form Nk =

d2kaka−k,we obtain Nk as canonical variables for drift waves in

the presence of the mean shear ﬂow. This automatically means that these

R

invariants have a meaning of the generalized wave action invariant. Then,

to account for the self-interactions in the presence of the background shear

ﬂow, the wave kinetic equation (Eq. (15) or (20)) should be modiﬁed with a

source term Jk in the standard form[15]

Jk = 4π

d2k1d2k2 × |Vk,k1,k2|2 (Nk1Nk2 − NkNk1 − NkNk) δ(k − k1 − k2).

(30)

We have formulated a wave kinetic equation and determined a structure of

12

an appropriate adiabatic invariant for small scale turbulence in the presence

of a mean ﬂow. We have shown that the form of the matrix coeﬃcient for

the nonlocal coupling of the small scale ﬂuctuations to the mean ﬂow is

crucial for the form of the adiabatic invariant. We have obtained adiabatic

invariant Nk = Ikk2ρ2

s(1 + k2ρ2

s) for the drift wave turbulence described by

the Hasegawa-Mima equation and isomorphic Charney-Obukhov equation for

Rossby waves; and the invariant Nk = Ik(1 + k2ρ2

s)2 for the drift wave type

turbulence in tokamaks such as TITG driven modes.

[Note that the latter

invariant reduces to the standard form [13, 14] for kθ = const.] The pseudo-

action invariants appear in the wave kinetic equation and correspond to the

quantities that are conserved as integrals over the small scale part of the

spectrum alone. This speciﬁc conservation property makes them suitable as

canonical Hamiltonian variables for small scale turbulence in the presence of

the shear ﬂow. The wave action invariants and the kinetic equation derived

here can be used to investigate nonlinear dynamics of drift waves and zonal

ﬂow in a tokamak. The method used in our work can be applied to derive

generalized invariants for other models including the Rossby type waves in

geostrophic ﬂuids [12].

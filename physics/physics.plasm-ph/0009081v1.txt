Abstract

It is shown that the magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium states of an axisym-
metric toroidal plasma with ﬁnite resistivity and ﬂows parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld are governed by a second-order partial diﬀerential equation for the poloidal
magnetic ﬂux function ψ coupled with a Bernoulli type equation for the plasma
density (which are identical in form to the corresponding ideal MHD equilibrium
equations) along with the relation ∆⋆ψ = Vcσ. (Here, ∆⋆ is the Grad-Schl¨uter-
Shafranov operator, σ is the conductivity and Vc is the constant toroidal-loop volt-
age divided by 2π). In particular, for incompressible ﬂows the above mentioned
partial diﬀerential equation becomes elliptic and decouples from the Bernoulli
equation [H. Tasso and G. N. Throumoulopoulos, Phys. Plasmas 5, 2378 (1998)].
For a conductivity of the form σ = σ(R, ψ) (R is the distance from the axis of
symmetry) several classes of analytic equilibria with incompressible ﬂows can be
constructed having qualitatively plausible σ proﬁles, i.e. proﬁles with σ taking a
maximum value close to the magnetic axis and a minimum value on the plasma
surface. For σ = σ(ψ) consideration of the relation ∆⋆ψ = Vcσ(ψ) in the vicinity
of the magnetic axis leads therein to a proof of the non-existence of either com-
pressible or incompressible equilibria. This result can be extended to the more
general case of non-parallel ﬂows lying within the magnetic surfaces.

I. Introduction

In addition to the case of the long living astrophysical plasmas, understanding
the equilibrium properties of resistive fusion plasmas is important, particularly
in view of the next step devices which will possibly demand pulse lengths of the
order of 103 secs (or more for an ITER size machine) ([1] and Refs. cited therein).
Theoretically, however, it was proved by Tasso [2] that resistive equilibria with
σ = σ(ψ) are not compatible with the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation. (Here,
σ is the conductivity and ψ is the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function.) The non-
existence of static axisymmetric resistive equilibria with a uniform conductivity
was also suggested recently [3, 4, 5]. Also, in the collisional regime Pﬁrsch and
Schl¨uter showed that the toroidal curvature gives rise to an enhanced diﬀusion,
which is related to the conductivity parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. In the above
mentioned studies the inertial-force ﬂow term ρ(v · ∇)v is neglected in the equa-
tion of momentum conservation. For ion ﬂow velocities of the order of 100 Km/m,
which have been observed in neutral-beam-heating experiments [6, 7, 8] the term
ρ(v · ∇)v can not be considered negligible. Therefore, it is worthwhile to inves-
tigate the nonlinear resistive equilibrium, in particular to address the following
issues: (a) the impact of the non-linear ﬂow in the Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter diﬀusion, and
(b) the existence of resistive equilibria, in particular equilibria with σ = σ(ψ).
Since the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium with arbitrary ﬂows and ﬁ-
nite conductivity is a very diﬃcult problem, in a recent study [9] we considered
an axisymmetric toroidal plasma with purely toroidal ﬂow including the term
ρ(v · ∇)v in the momentum-conservation equation. It was shown that the non-
linear ﬂow does not aﬀect the static-equilibrium situation, i.e σ = σ(ψ) equilibria
are not possible.

A way of constructing more plausible equilibria from the physical point of
view could be by considering ﬂows less restricted in direction. Taking also into
account the fact that the poloidal ﬂow in the edge region of magnetic-conﬁnement
systems plays a role in the transition from the low-conﬁnement mode to the high-
conﬁnement mode, in the present report we extend our previous studies to the case
of ﬂows having non-vanishing poloidal components in addition to toroidal ones.
Because of the diﬃculty of the problem we consider ﬂows parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld. Some of the conclusions, however, can be extended to non-parallel ﬂows
lying within the magnetic surfaces. It is also noted that possible equilibria with

2

parallel ﬂows would be free of Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter diﬀusion because the convective
term v × B in the Ohm’s low vanishes. The main conclusion is that for the
system under consideration the existence of equilibria depends crucially on the
spatial dependence of conductivity. The report is organized as follows. The
equilibrium equations for an axisymmetric toroidal resistive plasma with parallel
ﬂows surrounded by a conductor are derived in Sec. II. The existence of solutions
is then examined in Sec. III for the cases σ = σ(R, ψ) (R is the distance from
the axis of symmetry), and σ = σ(ψ). Sec. IV summarizes our conclusions.

II. Equilibrium equations

The MHD equilibrium states of a plasma with scalar conductivity are governed
by the following set of equations, written in standard notations and convenient
units:

∇ · (ρv) = 0,

ρ(v · ∇)v = j × B − ∇P,

∇ × E = 0,
∇ × B = j,
∇ · B = 0,
E + v × B =

j
σ

.

(6)

It is pointed out that, unlike to the usual procedure followed in equilibrium studies
with ﬂow [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] in the present work an equation of state is not
included in the above set of equations from the outset and therefore the equation
of state independent Eqs. (15) and (16) below are ﬁrst derived. This alternative
procedure is convenient because the equilibrium problem is then further reduced
for speciﬁc cases associated with several equations of state.

The system under consideration is a toroidal axisymmetric magnetically con-
ﬁned plasma, which is surrounded by a conductor (see Fig. 1 of Ref. [9]). With
the use of cylindrical coordinates R, φ, z the position of the surface of the con-
ductor is speciﬁed by some boundary curve in the (R, z) plane. The equilibrium
quantities do not depend on the azimuthal coordinate φ. Consequently, the di-
vergence free magnetic ﬁeld B and current density j can be expressed, with the

3

aid of Ampere’s low (4), in terms of the stream functions ψ(R, z) and I(R, z) as

B = I∇φ + ∇φ × ∇ψ,

(7)

and

j = ∆⋆ψ∇φ − ∇φ × ∇I.

(8)
Here, ∆⋆ is the elliptic operator deﬁned by ∆⋆ = R2∇ · (∇/R2) and constant ψ
surfaces are magnetic surfaces. Also, it is assumed that the plasma elements ﬂow
solely along B:

ρv = KB,

(9)

where K is a function of R and z. Acting the divergence operator on Eq. (9) and
taking into account Eq. (1) one obtains ∇K · B = 0. Therefore, the function K
is a surface quantity:

K = K(ψ).

(10)

Another surface quantity is identiﬁed from the toroidal component of the mo-
mentum conservation equation (2):

 1 −

K 2

ρ ! I = X(ψ).

(11)

From Eq. (11) it follows that, unlike the case in static equilibria, I is not (in
general) a surface quantity. Furthermore, expressing the time independent electric
ﬁeld by

E = −∇Φ + Vc∇φ,

(12)

where Vc is the constant toroidal-loop voltage divided by 2π, the poloidal and
toroidal components of Ohm’s law (6), respectively, yield

and

∇Φ = ∇φ × ∇I

σ

∆⋆ψ = Vcσ = EφRσ.

(13)

(14)

Here, Eφ is the toroidal component of E. Eq. (14) has an impact on the boundary
conditions, i.e. the component of E tangential to the plasma-conductor interface
does not vanish. Therefore, the container can not be considered perfectly con-
ducting. Accordingly, Ohm’s law with ﬁnite conductivity applied in the vicinity

4

of the plasma-conductor interface does not permit the existence of a surface layer
of current [16]. It is now assumed that the position of the conductor is such that
its surface coincides with the outermost of the closed magnetic surfaces. Thus,
the condition B· n = 0, where n is the outward unit vector normal to the plasma
surface, holds in the plasma-conductor interface and therefore the pressure P
must vanish on the boundary. It is noticed that this is possible only in equilib-
rium, because in the framework of resistive MHD time dependent equations, the
magnetic ﬂux is not conserved. With the aid of equations (7)-(11) the compo-
nents of Eq. (2) along B and perpendicular to a magnetic surface are put in the
respective forms

Summarizing, the resistive MHD equilibrium of an axisymmetric toroidal
plasma with parallel ﬂow is governed by the set of Eqs.
(14), (15) and (16).
Owing to the direction of the ﬂow parallel to B, Eqs. (15) and (16)do not con-
tain the conductivity and are identical in form to the corresponding equations
governing ideal equilibria. Therefore, on the one hand, several properties of the
ideal equilibria, e.g. the Shafranov shift of the magnetic surfaces and the de-
tachment of the isobaric surfaces from the magnetic surfaces (see the discussion

5

following Eq. (26) in Sec IIC) remain valid. On the other hand, as will be shown
in Sec. III, the conductivity σ in Eq. (14) plays an important role on the existence
of equilibria.

To reduce further equations (15) and (16), the starting set of equations (1)-(6)
must be supplemented by an equation of state, e.g. P = P (ρ, T ), along with an
equation determining the transport of internal energy. Such a rigorous treatment,
however, makes the equilibrium problem very cumbersome. Alternatively, one
can assume additional properties for the magnetic surfaces associated with either
isentropic processes, or isothermal processes, or incompressible ﬂows. These three
cases are separately examined in the remainder of this section.

A. Isentropic magnetic surfaces

We consider a plasma with large but ﬁnite conductivity such that for times
short compared with the diﬀusion time scale, the dissipative term ≈ j 2/σ can be
neglected. This permits one to assume conservation of the entropy: v · ∇S = 0,
(9) leads to S = S(ψ) (S is the speciﬁc entropy).
which on account of Eq.
It is noted that the case S = S(ψ) was considered in investigations on ideal
equilibria with arbitrary ﬂows [11, 12] and purely toroidal ﬂows [17, 18], as well
as on resistive equilibria with purely toroidal ﬂows [9]. In addition, the plasma
is assumed to being a perfect gas whose internal energy density W is simply
proportional to the temperature. Then, the equations for the thermodynamic
potentials lead to [17]

P = A(S)ργ

A(S)
γ − 1

ργ−1 =

(19)

(20)

and

W =

Here, A = A(S) is an arbitrary function of S, H = W + P/ρ is the speciﬁc
enthalpy and γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats. For simplicity and without loss
of generality we choose the function A to be identical with S. Consequently,
integration of Eq. (15) yields

K 2B 2
2ρ2 +

γ
γ − 1

Sργ−1 = H(ψ).

Eq. (16) reduces then to

where the prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to ψ. Apart from a factor
1/(γ−1) in the last term of the right-hand side ([1/(γ−1)]ργS ′ instead of ργS ′) Eq.
(22) is identical in form with the corresponding ideal MHD equation obtained by
Hameiri [12] (Eq. (7) therein). It should be noted that Eq. (22) remains regular
for the case of isothermal plasmas (γ = 1) while Hameiri’s result would make
the equilibrium equation strangely singular.
In particular, for S = S(ψ) and
T = const. Eq. (19) leads to ρ = ρ(ψ) and consequently the incompressibility
Incompressible ﬂows, however, are
equation ∇ · v = 0 follows from Eq.
described by Eq. (27) below which is free of the above mentioned singularity.

(1).

Unlike the case of static equilibria, Eq. (22) is not always elliptic; there are
three critical values of the poloidal-ﬂow Mach-number M 2 at which the type
of this equation changes, i.e.
it becomes alternatively elliptic and hyperbolic
[10, 12]. The toroidal ﬂow is not involved in these transitions because this is
incompressible by axisymmetry and, therefore, does not relate to hyperbolicity
(see also the discussion in the beginning of Sec. IIC).

B. Isothermal magnetic surfaces

Since for fusion plasmas the thermal conduction along B is expected to be fast
in relation to the heat transport perpendicular to a magnetic surface, equilibria
with isothermal magnetic surfaces are a reasonable approximation [17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22]. In particular, the even simpler case of isothermal resistive equilibria has
also been considered [23].

For T = T (ψ) integration of Eq. (15) leads to

K 2B 2
2ρ2 + λT ln ρ = H(ψ),

(23)

where λ is the proportionality constant in the ideal gas law P = λρT . Conse-
quently, Eq. (16) reduces to

K 2

ρ ! ∇ψ

R2 # + (v · B)K ′ +

X ′ + ρH ′ − λρ(1 − log ρ)T ′ = 0.

(24)

We remark that apart from the fact that the S terms have been replaced by T
terms, Eqs. (23) and (24) are identical with the respective Eqs. (21) and (22).

C. Incompressible ﬂows

7

The existence of hyperbolic regimes may be dangerous for plasma conﬁnement
because they are associated with shock waves which can cause equilibrium degra-
dation.
In this respect incompressible ﬂows are of particular interest because,
as is well known from gas dynamics, it is the compressibility that can give rise
to shock waves; thus for incompressible ﬂows the equilibrium equation becomes
always elliptic. For ∇ · v = 0 it follows from Eqs. (1) and (9) that the density is
a surface quantity

ρ = ρ(ψ),

(25)

consistent with the fact that in fusion experiments equilibrium density gradients
parallel to B have not been observed.

With the aid of Eq. (25), integration of Eq. (15) yields an expression for the

pressure:

P = Ps(ψ) −

v2
2

K 2B 2

2ρ

(26)

We note here that, unlike in static equilibria, in the presence of ﬂow magnetic
surfaces in general do not coincide with isobaric surfaces because Eq. (2) implies
that B · ∇P in general diﬀers from zero. In this respect, the term Ps(ψ) is the
static part of the pressure which does not vanish when v = 0. If it is now assumed
that K 2
ρ 6= 1 and Eq. (26) is inserted into Eq. (16), the latter reduces to the
elliptic diﬀerential equation

[22]).

Eq.
(27) is identical in form to the corresponding ideal equilibrium equation
(Eq.
It is also noted that special cases of incompressible
(22) of Ref.
ideal equilibria have been investigated in Refs.
[24] and [25]. Unlike to the
corresponding sets of compressible S = S(ψ) equations (21) and (22), and T =
T (ψ) equations (23) and (24), Eq. (27) is decoupled from Eq. (26). Once the
solutions of Eq. (27) are known, Eq. (26) only determines the pressure.

III. The existence of solutions in relation to the

conductivity proﬁle

We shall show that the compatibility of Eq. (14) containing the conductivity
σ with the “ideal” equations (15) and (16) depends crucially on the spatial de-
pendence of σ. In this respect the cases σ = σ(R, ψ), and σ = σ(ψ) are examined
below.

8

A. σ = σ(R, ψ)

e

An explicit spatial dependence of σ, in addition to that of ψ, is interesting
because it makes the equilibrium problem well posed, i.e.
in this case Eq. (14)
can be decoupled from the other Eqs. (15) and (16). A possible explicit spatial
dependence of σ can be justiﬁed by the following arguments: (a) Even in Spitzer
conductivity, σ = αT 3/2
, the quantity α has a (weak) spatial dependence and (b)
cylindrically symmetric resistive σ = σ(ψ) equilibria are possible [9] and therefore
the non-existence of axisymmetric static toroidal σ = σ(ψ) equilibria is related
to the toroidicity involving through the scale factor |∇φ| = 1/R; this could also
imply an explicit dependence of σ on R. In addition, we may remark that the
neoclassical conductivity depends on the aspect ratio A because the fraction of
trapped particles relates to A (see [26] and Refs. cited therein). It should be
noted, however, that a knowledge of the σ-proﬁle in the various collisionality
regimes of magnetic conﬁnement has not been obtained to date.

For us the main advantage in allowing σ = σ(R, ψ) lies in the fact that Eq.

(14) can then be considered as a formula determining the conductivity

σ =

∆⋆ψ
Vc

,

(28)

provided ψ is known. Also, the poloidal electric ﬁeld can then be obtained by
Eq. (13).

To determine ψ in the case of compressible ﬂows with isentropic magnetic
surfaces the set of Eqs. (21) and (22), which are coupled through the density ρ,
should be solved numerically under appropriate boundary conditions. This can
be accomplished by the existing ideal MHD equilibrium codes [13, 14, 15]. The
problem of compressible ﬂows with isothermal magnetic surfaces [Eqs. (23) and
(24)] can be solved in a similar way.

For incompressible ﬂows ψ can be determined by Eq. (27) alone, which is
amendable to several classes of analytic solutions. In particular, sheared- poloidal-
ﬂow equilibria associated with “radial” (poloidal) electric ﬁelds which play a role
in the L-H transition can be constructed by means of the transformation [27, 28]

U(ψ) = Z ψ

[1 − M 2(ψ′)1/2] dψ, M 2 < 1,

(29)

It is noted here that the requirement M 2 < 1 in transformation (29) implies that

Since, according to experimental evidence in tokamaks [29], the (maximum) value
of the ion poloidal velocity in the edge region during the L-H transition is of the
order of 10 Km/sec and the ion temperature is of the order of 1 KeV, the scaling
vp ≪ vs is satisﬁed in this region. Therefore, the restriction M 2 < 1 is of non-
operational relevance. The simplest solution of Eq. (27) corresponding to M 2 =
const., X 2 = const. and Ps ∝ ψ, is given by

where ψc is the ψ value on the magnetic axis located at (z = 0, R = Rc) and d
is a parameter related to the shape of ﬂux surfaces. Equation (31) describes the
Hill’s vortex conﬁguration [30]. The conductivity then follows from Eq. (28):

σ = σc(cid:18) R

4"2 −(cid:18) R

− d2(cid:18) z

(32)

where σc is the value of σ on the magnetic axis. The conductivity proﬁle in
the middle-plane z = 0 is illustrated in Fig. 1. We remark the outward displace-
ment of the maximum-conductivity position Rmax with respect to Rc (Rmax/Rc =
2/√3) and the asymetry of the inner part of the proﬁle as compared with the
outer part due to the explicit R dependence of σ.

B. σ = σ(ψ)

For this case we consider Eq. (14) in the vicinity of the magnetic axis by trans-
forming the coordinates from (R, z, φ) to (x, y, φ) (Fig. 2). The transformation
is given by

R = Rc + x = Rc + rcosθ
z = y = −rsinθ.

(33)

10

The quantities ψ(x, y) and σ(ψ) are then expanded to second-order in x and y:

ψ(x, ψ) = ψc + c1

(34)

and

σ = σc + σ1(ψ − ψc) + . . . = σc + σ1(c1

x2
2

+ c2

y2
2

+ c3xy + . . .) + . . . .

(35)

Here, c1 = (∂2ψ/∂x2)c, c2 = (∂2ψ/∂y2)c, c3 = (∂2ψ/∂x∂y)c, σc is the conductivity
on the magnetic axis and σ1 = const. On the basis of Eqs. (34) and (35) Eq.
∆⋆ψ = Vcσ(ψ) becomes a polynomial in x and y which should vanish identically.
This requirement leads to c1 = c3 = 0 and, therefore, it follows from Eq. (34)
that the magnetic surfaces in the vicinity of the magnetic axis are not closed
surfaces.

The non-existence of σ(ψ) equilibria with closed magnetic surfaces can be
extended to the case of non-parallel ﬂows lying within the magnetic surfaces.
Indeed, if the relation v · ∇ψ = 0 is assumed instead of v k B, the toroidal
component of Eq. (6) leads again to Eq. (14).

A possible proof of the non-existence of η = η(ψ) equilibria far from the
magnetic axis has not been obtained to date. It may be noted, however, that
for σ = σ(ψ), Eq. (16) becomes parabolic. This follows by considering in this
equation the determinant D of the symmetric matrix of coeﬃcients. On account
of ∆⋆ψ = Vcσ(ψ), and ρ = ρ(R, ψ,|∇ψ|) by Eq. (15), the second derivatives of
equation (16) are contained only in the term

K 2
ρ

∂ρ

∂|∇ψ|2∇|∇ψ|2 · ∇ψ,

which comes from the term ∇ · [(1 − K 2/ρ)∇ψ/R2]. Subsequent evaluation of
D leads to D = 0. Therefore, the function ψ is (over)restricted everywhere to
satisfy a parabolic equation and the elliptic equation ∆⋆ψ = Vcσ(ψ).

IV. Conclusions

The equilibrium of an axisymmetric plasma with ﬂow parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld
has been investigated within the framework of the resistive magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) theory. For the system under consideration the equilibrium equations

11

reduce to a set of a second-order diﬀerential equation for the poloidal magnetic
ﬂux function ψ coupled through the density with an algebraic Bernoulli equation,
which are identical in form with the corresponding ideal MHD equations, and the
equation ∆⋆ψ = Vcσ. (∆⋆, Vc and σ are the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov elliptic
operator, the constant toroidal loop voltage and the conductivity, respectively.
The existence of solutions of the above mentioned set of equations is sensitive to
the spatial dependence of σ.

For a conductivity of the form σ = σ(R, ψ), Eq. ∆⋆ψ = Vcσ can be considered
uncoupled to the other two equations, thus determining only the conductivity.
For compressible ﬂows and isentopic magnetic surfaces the diﬀerential equation
for ψ [(Eq. (22)], pending on the value of the poloidal ﬂow, can be either elliptic
or hyperbolic. Solutions of the set of this equation and the coupled Bernoulli
equation [Eq. (21)] can be obtained numerically. The problem of compressible
equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces [Eqs. (23) and (24)] can be solved
in a similar way. For incompressible equilibria ψ obeys an elliptic diﬀerential
equation [(Eq. (27)], uncoupled to the associated Bernoulli equation [Eq. (26)]
which just determines the pressure. Several classes of analytic equilibria with
incompressible ﬂows having qualitatively plausible σ proﬁles, i.e, proﬁles with σ
taking a maximum value close to the magnetic axis and a minimum value on the
plasma surface, can be constructed. In particular, sheared-poloidal-ﬂow equilibria
can be derived by means of the transformation (29) for ψ.

For σ = σ(ψ) appreciation of ∆⋆ψ = Vcσ in the vicinity of the magnetic
axis proves therein, irrespective of plasma compressibility, the non-existence of
closed magnetic surfaces. This result can be extended to the case of non-parallel
ﬂows lying within the magnetic surfaces.
In addition, for parallel ﬂows ψ is
(over)restricted to satisfy throughout the plasma an elliptic and a parabolic dif-
ferential equations.

According to the results of the present investigation, the existence of resistive
equilibria is sensitive to the spatial dependence of conductivity. Thus, the task of
obtaining this dependence in the various conﬁnement regimes of fusion plasmas
may deserve further experimental and theoretical investigations. A conductivity
with a spatial dependence in addition to that of ψ, on the one hand, would open
up the possibility of the existence of several classes of resistive equilibria free of
Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter diﬀusion. On the other hand, a strict Spitzer-like conductivity,

12

σ = σ(ψ), should imply the persistence of a Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter-like diﬀusion also in
the non-linear ﬂow regime.

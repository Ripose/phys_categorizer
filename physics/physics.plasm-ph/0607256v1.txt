We report the ﬁrst experimental observation of stationary zonal ﬂows in the pedestal region of
the H-mode plasma in the H-1 toroidal heliac. Strong peaks in Er shear mark the top and foot of
the density pedestal. Strong m = n = 0 low-frequency (f < 0.6 kHz) zonal ﬂows are observed in
regions of increased Er, suggesting substantial contribution of zonal ﬂows to the spatial modulation
of Er radial proﬁles. Radial localization of zonal ﬂows is correlated with a region of zero magnetic
shear and low-order (7/5) rational surfaces.

Transport barriers are radially localized regions in
toroidal plasma where plasma diﬀusivity is drastically
reduced.
In the high conﬁnement mode (H-mode) [1],
the presence of a transport barrier is manifested as a
steep density (or temperature) gradient near the plasma
boundary.
In this case it is referred to as the edge
pedestal.

Characteristics of the H-mode edge transport barrier
are important, although it is usually quite narrow. The
structure of the transport barrier is closely related to
the global stability, conﬁnement and hence the plasma
performance (for a review see, for example, [2]). Un-
derstanding and predicting the pedestal characteristics
has become a focus of the international fusion commu-
nity (see, e.g., [3, 4]). The ultimate goal of these studies
is the optimization of the radial proﬁles of the plasma
parameters in the future fusion reactor [5].

The formation of a transport barrier has been ascribed
to the generation of a sheared radial electric ﬁeld (or
E × B ﬂow, where E is the electric ﬁeld and B is the
magnetic ﬁeld) which leads to the reduction in turbu-
lence and transport [6, 7, 8]. However, the physics of the
transport barrier formation is not yet well understood.
Experimental studies of transport barriers are restricted
due to diﬃculties in measuring radial parameter proﬁles
with suﬃcient spatial and temporal resolution.

In this Letter we report detailed experimental studies
of the density pedestal structure in H-mode of the H-1 he-
liac. It is shown for the ﬁrst time, that distinct features in
the electron density proﬁle, marking the pedestal top and
its foot, spatially coincide with radially localized strongly
sheared E × B ﬂows. These radial regions are also iden-
tiﬁed as regions where strong stationary m = n = 0 zonal
ﬂows are localized in H-mode. The radial localization of
zonal ﬂows also coincides with the position of a low-order
rational surface and a minimum in the magnetic shear.

These results conﬁrm, to some extent, a hypothesis based
on results of the gyrokinetic simulations that strong zonal
ﬂows developing near rational surfaces can provide a trig-
ger for the transport barrier formation [9].

We present results obtained in the H-1 toroidal heliac
[10] (major radius of R = 1 m and mean minor plasma
radius of about hai ≈ 0.2 m) under the following plasma
conditions (see, for example, [11] and references therein):
ne = 1 × 1018 m−3, Te ∼ 10 eV, Ti ∼ 40 eV in argon at
ﬁlling pressure of (1 − 4)×10−5 Torr and at low magnetic
ﬁelds, B = (0.05 − 0.12) T. Such plasma is produced by
∼ 80 kW of the radio-frequency waves at 7 MHz. Several
combinations of Langmuir probes (single, triple probes)
are used to characterize plasma parameters, such as the
electron density, electron temperature, and electrostatic
potential, as described in [12]. Probes are also used to
characterize poloidal and toroidal wave numbers of tur-
bulent ﬂuctuations [13].

The high conﬁnement mode observed in H-1 [14] is
similar to H mode in tokamaks. Typical plasma density
and plasma potential proﬁles are illustrated in Fig. 1 for
low (L) and H modes. L and H modes are achieved re-
spectively above and below critical magnetic ﬁeld [14].
When the magnetic ﬁeld is close to the critical value,
spontaneous L-H transitions are observed. In these dis-
charges, a triple probe is used to measure the plasma
density and potential on a shot-to-shot basis. Excellent
reproducibility of the measurements allows reliable deter-
mination of proﬁles without perturbing plasma by mul-
tichannel probes.

Despite large diﬀerence in plasma parameters (electron
temperature, density, and magnetic ﬁeld), plasmas in H-1
and in the pedestal regions of large tokamaks, are dimen-
sionally similar. This dimensional similarity has been dis-
cussed in [15], where it has been shown that the pedestal
width measured in ion gyroradii is very similar to that in,
for example, DIII-D tokamak. However in absolute units,
the pedestal width in H-1 is substantially broader (30-40
mm) than that in larger experiments with stronger mag-
netic ﬁelds and lighter ions. This, in combination with
low electron temperature in H-1, opens an opportunity

to study structure of the pedestal using probes with suf-
ﬁciently high spatial resolution.

The development of the density pedestal in H mode
plasma in H-1 is illustrated in Fig. 1. Radial proﬁles of
the electron density and the plasma potential in L mode
are rather featureless as seen in Fig. 1(a,b). In H mode,
the central density doubles while the plasma potential
becomes more negative in the central region and more
positive at the edge (Fig. 1(c,d)). The increase in the
density coincides with the formation of the characteristic
kink in the density proﬁle at about ρ = r/a ≈ 0.6, re-
ferred to as the top of the pedestal. The ne proﬁle in the
pedestal region can be approximated by a straight line
(Fig. 1(c)). The proﬁle of the plasma potential φ also
shows two characteristic kinks: one at the pedestal top,
and the other at ρ = 0.8, which we will refer to as the
pedestal foot. The third kink in the plasma potential is
seen near the last closed ﬂux surface (ρ = 1.0) and indi-
cates the reversal of the radial electric ﬁeld from negative
(inside) to positive (outside). We use dashed guide lines
and shading throughout the paper to mark two radial re-
gions of interest: (I) - a region between the pedestal-top
and the pedestal-foot, and (II) - a region between the
pedestal foot and the last closed ﬂux surface.

Proﬁles of the radial electric ﬁeld Er and its shear E′
r,
derived from the radial proﬁle of the plasma potential
are shown in Fig. 2. Three distinct Er regions can be
easily seen: slightly positive Er inside the pedestal top,
substantial negative Er ≈ -1 kV/m in region I, and even
more negative Er ≈ -4 kV/m in region II. Correspond-
ingly, the E′
r has distinct maxima at the pedestal top,
pedestal foot and the last closed ﬂux surface.

Fluctuations in the plasma density and potential are
strongly reduced in a broad range of frequencies from L to
H mode as discussed in [16]. However, the low frequency

(f < 0.6 kHz) ﬂuctuations increase in some radial re-
gions, which will be discussed later. The power spectra of
the ﬂuctuations in the plasma potential, P (φ), at various
radial positions in H mode are shown in Fig. 3(a). The
ﬁgure shows that the low-frequency components (0.1−0.6
kHz) are dominant in H-mode. Poloidal wave number
kθ of the low frequency components is measured using
two poloidally separated probes. Measured poloidal wave
number of kθ = 2 − 5 m−1 at f = 0.1 − 0.6 kHz is in-
dicative of the mode number m = 0. The toroidal mode
number is estimated using toroidally separated probes, as
described in [13], and shows n = 0. Hence the strong low
frequency ﬂuctuations in the plasma potential are identi-
ﬁed as stationary zonal ﬂows. It should be noted that it
is usually diﬃcult to align toroidally separated probes to
exactly the same poloidal position. As a result, a phase
shift between toroidally separated probes will occur due
to the uncertainty in the poloidal separation between the
probes, ∆y:

∆ϕ(f ) = kk(f )∆Lk + kθ(f )∆y,

(1)

where ∆Lk and ∆y are toroidal and poloidal separa-
tion between the probes respectively, and kθ(f ) is known
from the phase diﬀerence between the probes which are
poloidally separated. In case of a zonal ﬂow, m = 0, the
second term on the right-hand side becomes zero (since
kθ = 0), such that the poloidal uncertainty ∆y becomes
unimportant and the toroidal wave number can be reli-
ably estimated by measuring ∆ϕ.

Spectra similar to those in Fig. 3(a) have also been
observed in the Compact Helical System (CHS) using
heavy-ion-beam probe [17]. In that experiment, low fre-
quency potential structures were also identiﬁed as sta-

tionary zonal ﬂows.

The spectral power density of zonal ﬂows (shaded spec-
tral region of f = 0.1 − 0.6 kHz in Fig. 3(a)) varies
along the radius. The radial proﬁle of these zonal ﬂows
in H-mode is presented in Fig. 3(b). Stationary zonal
ﬂows are band-like structures localized in radial regions
of 0.6 < ρ < 0.8, and 0.8 < ρ < 1.0.

Zonal ﬂows are expected to be ﬂuctuating in space [18],
such that their maxima may have diﬀerent sign. The
zonal ﬂow intensity shown in Fig. 3(b) has two positive
peaks, since the amplitude is estimated from the auto-
power spectrum P (φ) ∝ φ2.

The radial locations of the two zonal ﬂow maxima in
Fig. 3(b) coincide with regions I and II in Fig. 2(a) where
Er is incrementally increased. This is suggestive that
stationary zonal ﬂows directly contribute to mean Er and
may be responsible for the ”corrugation” of the Er proﬁle
seen in Fig. 2(a).

The list of spatially coinciding phenomena in this
plasma is complemented by the observation that the
pedestal region appears in the vicinity of the zero mag-
netic shear in this magnetic conﬁguration. The radial
proﬁle of the rotational transform  ι = 1/q (where q is
the safety factor) is shown in Fig. 4. In addition to zero
shear at ρ ≈ 0.75,  ι = 1.4 = n/m = 7/5 rational surfaces
are present in both zones I (at ρ ≈ 0.65) and II (at ρ ≈
0.85).

FIG. 4: Radial proﬁle of rotational transform in magnetic
conﬁguration discussed in this paper.

The importance of rational surfaces in H-mode has
been recognized since the ﬁrst observation of H-mode
in stellarators [19].
In the W7-AS stellarator, the H-
mode was observed in narrow rotational transform win-
dows (e.g., 0.51 <  ι < 0.53).
In the TJ-II heliac, the
presence of the low-order rational surfaces in the mag-
netic structure has also been suggested as the likely cause
of the change in ﬂuctuation induced transport and the
increased E × B ﬂow [20].
It was suggested that the
low-order rational surface aﬀects the radial electric ﬁeld
in its vicinity [21], although the connection between ra-
tional ﬂux surface and ﬂuctuation-induced transport is
still not fully understood. Spatial correlation of the ra-
tional surfaces with the stationary zonal ﬂows, seen in
Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 4, may be indicative of the generation
of stationary zonal ﬂows due to the inﬂuence of the ra-
tional surfaces. This in turn results in the modiﬁcation
of ﬂuctuation properties and the generation of E × B
ﬂows.

Formation of the density pedestal and strong station-
ary zonal ﬂows is also observed during spontaneous L-H
transitions in H-1, described in [15]. Fig. 5(a) shows tem-
poral evolution of the mean plasma density during spon-
taneous L-H transition. In this discharge the mean elec-
tron density jumps from about 0.6 × 1018 m−3 to almost
1.2×1018 m−3 in about one millisecond. Similarly to sta-
tionary H-mode discharges described above, strong zonal
ﬂows in the pedestal region and between the pedestal
foot and the last closed ﬂux surface are observed in the
H-mode stage of discharges with spontaneous transitions.
The spatial correlation of the pedestal regions and sta-
tionary zonal ﬂows in the spontaneous transitions is also
observed.

In Fig. 5(b), the change of the ﬂuctuation power spec-
tra across the L to H-mode transition at the radial po-
sition of ρ = 0.65 is illustrated.
It can be seen that
across the transition, ﬂuctuations in the broad spectral
range from 0.6 to 100 kHz are reduced, while the spectral
power of low-frequency zonal ﬂows (f < 0.1−0.6 kHz) are
increased. This is observed in the pedestal region where
strong zonal ﬂows are observed in H-mode.

Most of the ingredients of the pedestal physics pre-
sented in this paper have been discussed with regard to
H-modes in tokamaks and stellarators, for example, the
role of the low-order rational surfaces [8, 22], the role of
low-order islands at the edge in H-mode in W7-AS [19],
the role of zonal ﬂows in the transport barrier formation
[23], modiﬁcation of the Er proﬁles by non-neoclassical
(turbulence-driven) eﬀects [6, 24, 25].

Here we present for the ﬁrst time experimental evi-
dence that zonal ﬂows, which develop near the n/m =
7/5 rational surfaces, are spatially correlated with dis-
tinct regions of the radial electric ﬁeld inside the pedestal
region in the H-mode plasma in H-1. The resulting strong
peaks in Er shear coincide with the kinks in the density
pedestal proﬁle in H mode, suggesting that the strong
peaks in the E′
r deﬁne position and width of the H-mode
density pedestal. Similar physical picture has recently
emerged as a result of analysis of gyrokinetic simulations
of DIII-D tokamak discharges [9]. Corrugations in the
radial proﬁles of electron density, temperature and ra-
dial electric ﬁeld in DIII-D are observed near low-order
rational surfaces. The development of strong zonal ﬂows
and strong Er shear layer in these plasma regions sug-
gests the development of zonal ﬂow as a trigger for the
transport barrier formation.

Since zonal ﬂows are usually thought of as turbulence-
driven ﬂows, possible mechanisms of the zonal ﬂow en-
hancement and sustainment in H mode, when the level of
turbulence is substantially reduced, need to be explained.
It has been suggested in [16], that the redistribution of
spectral energy from a broad range of intermediate scales

4

into a stationary zonal ﬂow is the mechanism of the zonal
ﬂow enhancement during L-H transitions. The result
shown in Fig. 5(b), to large extent conﬁrms this hypothe-
sis in a radial region close to the pedestal. Also in [16] we
presented experimental evidence that the nonlocal spec-
tral transfer of energy from the unstable drift wave is
responsible for the sustainment of zonal ﬂow in H-mode,
as has been theoretically predicted in [26].

Abstract. We report results from a series of PIC simulations carried out to investigate
the interaction of intense laser light with overdense plasma and in particular, aspects of
the harmonic emission spectrum generated in these interactions. Recent observations of
emission in this range by Watts et al. [1] show emission above the 20th harmonic extending
to the 37th with conversion eﬃciencies of order 10−6 with this spectrum showing distinct, if
variable, modulation of between two and four harmonics. This spectral feature proved highly
sensitive to the incident intensity, with more pronounced modulation at higher intensities.
These authors also reported results from a set of model PIC simulations which showed a
modulated emission spectrum across the entire harmonic range, but with a wider modulation
bandwidth.

In the results to be presented we report on features of the emission spectrum across a wide
parameter range and its dependence on the detailed structure of the plasma density proﬁle.
While we do see evidence of a modulated spectrum, this appears to be sensitive not only to
the incident intensity but to the plasma density proﬁle. In addition plasma emission present
further complicates the harmonic emission spectrum. Our results lead us to conclude that
attempts to interpret modulation in emission spectra in terms of one particular theoretical
model and from this to infer the dynamics of the critical surface may be misguided.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of high power laser pulses with ultradense plasma has proved a rich source
of new plasma phenomena as varied as channel formation and the generation of intense-
localized magnetic ﬁelds. One of the earliest laser-plasma interactions to be studied in detail
- and one of enduring interest - is the generation of multiple harmonics of the incident light.
Diﬀerent mechanisms for harmonic generation apply across diﬀering intensity ranges and
target characteristics but perhaps most attention now attaches to harmonic production by
short intense laser pulses incident on solid targets. Short pulses without signiﬁcant pre-pulse
create target plasmas free from extensive underdense coronal regions.

Harmonic generation is not only of intrinsic interest but holds promise as a diagnostic of
plasma conditions in the surface interaction region and, potentially of other physical processes
localized there. As well as targets of dense slab plasmas the other determinant for eﬃcient
harmonic production is the brightness of the source. For light of intensity I and wavelength
L in the range 1018 − 1019 W cm−2 µm2 typically generate a harmonic range
λL, values of I λ2
of 50 harmonics and Norreys et al. [2] detected harmonics up to the 75th (with conversion
eﬃciency of 10−6) for 1.053 µm wavelength light interacting with a solid target. Such a
harmonic range holds potential as a source of coherent XUV radiation. The harmonics in
the spectrum of reﬂected light are generated by electrons accelerated across the vacuum-solid
interface by the electric ﬁeld of the pulse.

The spectral characteristics of the reﬂected light are broadly understood. Conditions favour-
ing optimal harmonic generation include intensities in the range 1018 − 1019 W cm−2 µm2
with plasma densities of a few tens nc, where nc denotes the critical density. Typically this
combination of intensity and target plasma density gives rise to a spectrum of 50 or more
harmonics with a conversion eﬃciency of 10−6. An important transition takes place at an
intensity threshold below which plasma expansion occurs thus creating a region of underdense
plasma and above which channel boring and ponderomotive steepening are dominant.

Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations have been invaluable in understanding and characterizing
this harmonic emission. Gibbon [3] used this approach to good eﬀect in identifying the phys-
ical mechanism underlying harmonic generation, attributing it to those electrons that make
vacuum excursions and then free-stream back into the target plasma. Gibbon’s work showed
that the current sources generating the harmonics are localized just within the overdense
plasma boundary. These simulations led to an empirical expression for the eﬃciency of high-
order harmonic generation ηm ∼ 9 × 10−5
where I18 denotes light intensity
in units of 1018 W cm−2.

In the work presented here we use a PIC code to further interpret aspects of the reﬂected
light spectrum and to extend these simulations over a wider range of parameters. Boyd
and Ondarza [4,5] examined in detail the eﬀects of plasma line emission on the harmonic
spectrum. Strong plasma emission was recorded, with harmonics up to the ﬁfth detected in
both the reﬂected and transmitted spectra. A robust feature of the reﬂected spectra appeared
on the blue side of the plasma line between (1.2-1.6) ωp, where ωp is the plasma frequency. In
this work jets of electrons of relativistic energy penetrating the ultra-dense plasma generated
strongly nonthermal Langmuir waves. The spectrum of Langmuir waves was localized at the
front edge of the plasma slab. This localization is important for the subsequent coupling of the
plasma waves to the radiation ﬁeld by means of the steep density gradient in the (perturbed)
peak density region. Fig. 1 reproduces the spectrum obtained by Boyd and Ondarza [5]
showing the reﬂected harmonic spectrum and the plasma line for ne/nc = 30 and a0 = 0.5.
In this case the feature between ωp and 2 ωp shows up as enhanced harmonic lines between
8 ωL and 12 ωL, in contrast to the broad less well-resolved feature recorded for other choices
of parameters.

We were prompted to re-examine the plasma line eﬀects on the spectrum by results reported

by Watts et al. [1]. In this work using light intensities up to 1.0 × 1019 W cm−2 incident on
a solid surface, harmonics up to the 37th were recorded with a conversion eﬃciency ≥ 10−7.
The striking feature of the spectra at the highest intensity is a distinct if irregular modulation
with a frequency between 2 and 4 times that of the incident light (Fig. 2). Watts et al. found
that although modulations peak at diﬀerent harmonics they were observable across the entire
spectral range although their published spectra show only a part of this range, and that at
relatively low conversion eﬃciencies.

In conjunction with these observations they simulated the emission spectrum for
conditions approximating those in the experiment apart from their choice of thickness of the
simulated plasma which was only one wavelength across. In addition they used a pulse with
a sine-squared temporal proﬁle. The simulated spectra showed a clear modulation with an

amplitude that increased with laser intensity. In contrast to previous work using the same
code where modulations were attributed to internal reﬂections of transmitted light within the
plasma box (Lichters et al. [6]), Watts et al. suggest that the modulation structure is intrinsic
to harmonic generation. For a plasma one wavelength thick and with density ne = 13 nc they

spectral range of m = 40 whereas for Iλ2

a correlation of the modulated spectra with an examination of the dynamics of the criti-
cal surface, showing that surface modes excited by nonlinearities could have relatively large
amplitudes. For the higher intensity studied, it appeared that harmonics at m = 4, 5 were
dominant. From this they concluded that the oscillating-mirror model of harmonic generation
proposed by Bulanov et al. [7] was capable of interpreting the modulation observed.

The spectra reported by Watts et al. and the inferences drawn by them prompted us to look
again at spectra from our earlier simulations. The PIC code we use, like the Pfund-Lichters
code used by Watts et al., embeds the Bourdier technique to allow for oblique incidence but
in contrast to theirs, our simulation plasma can be up to ten wavelengths in extent, with
the plasma density ramped at the front surface. Vacuum gaps extend from both the front of
the ramp and the planar rear surface of the plasma to the walls of the simulation box. The
initial electron temperature was chosen to be 1 keV and we used a gaussian pulse of variable
length. The normalized quiver velocity a0 ∼ 0.85(cid:0)I18λ2
lay in the range 0.5-2.0 with slab
L(cid:1)
densities between 4 nc and 64 nc. The ions formed a neutralizing background.

Our attention focused on the eﬀect of the plasma density on the modulated spectra. Given
the wealth of detail in the spectra presented in terms of the dependence of the modulation
on laser light intensity and pulse length as well as on the density and the density proﬁle, it is
perhaps worth highlighting at the start the principal ﬁnding from our work.

The spectrum shows clear and uniform modulation with an average modulation frequency of
3.3 ωL for a plasma with ωp = 3.2 ωL. We contend that the spectrum of reﬂected light shows
harmonic structure modulated at the Langmuir frequency.

To support this interpretation we carried out simulations across a range of intensities and
pulse lengths. In all of these we used a plasma slab 4 wavelengths thick without any density
ramping. Fig. 4 shows spectra for runs with a0 = 0.6 and ne = 9 nc and 19 nc respectively.

These spectra are modulated at frequencies of 3.3 ωL and 4.4 ωL, consistent with the Langmuir
frequencies for these densities. Note in passing that for this combination of parameters
the level of plasma line emission is low enough for the harmonic spectrum to be relatively
unperturbed. With increasing density the harmonic range narrows correspondingly until a
point where just one modulation cycle persists as in Fig. 5 for a0 = 0.5, ne/nc = 64 with a
pulse length of 17 fs. For this density the plasma line is centred on m = 8 and we see the
eﬀects of the Langmuir wave spectrum on neighbouring harmonic lines, notably on the blue
wing. Apart from the strength of the plasma line, this spectrum shows somewhat similar
structure to that in Fig. 1.
It now appears that the detail in the spectrum identiﬁed by
Boyd and Ondarza [5] as the “combination line” is nothing other than the ampliﬁcation of
individual harmonic lines in the spectrum by the nonthermal Langmuir waves excited in the
supra-dense plasma.

If we wish to reproduce spectra showing several cycles of modulation at higher densities we
need to generate emission spectra at higher a0. However the combination of higher intensity
and increased plasma density results in the Langmuir wave being more strongly driven and at
the same time signiﬁcantly broadened. Simple linear estimates of the bandwidth of Langmuir
waves ∆ω, excited by a beam of fast electrons give ∆ω ∼ (∆Vb/vb) (ne/nc)
ωL for a beam
velocity vb with velocity spread ∆Vb. Our PIC simulations show strongly driven Langmuir
waves at the front edge of the plasma slab and this localization is crucial for coupling to
the radiation ﬁeld by the steep gradients in the perturbed peak density zone (cf. Boyd and

Ondarza [5]). As the plasma emission line becomes more strongly driven it modiﬁes the
harmonic spectrum in the region of the plasma frequency (cf. Fig. 1). This in turn means
that one has to look for modulation cycles at frequencies well above ωp. As we have remarked
already the number of harmonic lines (above a conversion eﬃciency of 10−6, say) reduces with
increasing density so that the spectral window available is squeezed from both ends.

Fig. 6 shows a more strongly driven result (a0 = 1.0) for densities ne = 25 nc and ne = 50 nc.
The plasma line is now evident and aﬀects neighbouring harmonic lines so that in Fig. 6a
with ωp/ωL = 5 the ﬁrst full modulation cycle appears at m = 8. Three cycles with an
average modulational frequency of 5.3 ωL can be resolved above a conversion level of 10−6.
For ne = 50 nc, ωp/ωL ≃ 7.1 and there are now just two cycles above this level with an average
modulational frequency of 8 ωL.

again than in Fig. 6. The harmonic spectrum above a conversion level 10−6 now extends
to approximately m = 60 (Fig. 7). However at this intensity not only is in the plasma line
a strong feature but its second harmonic is strong enough to perturb the line spectrum.
Consequently one can resolve only 3 modulation cycles with an average frequency of 8.7 ωL.

In all the cases discussed thus far, the PIC simulation plasma has been in the form of a slab.
We have also examined the eﬀect on the modulation of a ramped density proﬁle to check the
claim by Watts et al. that density ramping served to suppress the eﬀect. We too found a
comparable decay in modulation as the thickness of the ramp is increased. Fig. 8 shows our
result for a0 = 0.5, ne/nc = 10 for diﬀerent thickness of ramp ∆; (a) ∆ = 0.2 λL and (b)
∆ = 0.4 λL. From this it is evident that although some modulation persists when a ramp of
thickness 0.2 λL is present, the eﬀect disappeared completely in Fig. 8b.

II. CONCLUSIONS

Our simulations lead us to conclude that the modulations we see in the harmonic spectrum
stem from the eﬀect of Langmuir waves excited in the plasma slab. We have shown that
1/2 over a wide range. The
the modulation frequency varies with the plasma density as ne
modulation is evident for choices of intensity and pulse length for which plasma line emission
does not distort the spectrum to any marked degree. On this interpretation the modulation
frequency aﬀords a measure of plasma density as distinct from the claim by Watts et al.
of its potential as a diagnostic of the dynamics of the critical surface. The presence of a
density ramp a fraction of a wavelength thick appears to suppress the modulation as Watts
et al. found. We see this as consistent with our interpretation in that the presence of a ramp
ensures that there is no longer a unique plasma density at the surface.

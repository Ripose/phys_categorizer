Abstract

New types of symmetry for the Rayleigh equation are found. For small Atwood num-

ber, an analytic solution is obtained for a smoothly varying density proﬁle. It is shown

that a transition layer with a ﬁnite width can undergo some kind of stratiﬁcation.

Although Rayleigh had investigated the instability (known now as Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)

instability) using an exponential proﬁle of density [1], most investigations have been done so

using sharp interfaces [2-6]. In [7] it is carried out making an interesting analogy between the

equations which describes the RT instability, and the Schrodinger equation. In that study, an

“equivalent potential” is constructed and for well-known density proﬁles it is shown that the

Schrodinger equation with the corresponding “equivalent potential” has the same eigenvalues

as the Rayleigh equation.

The physical quantities (e.g.; density, velocity) and their derivatives, generally speaking

cannot suﬀer a jump discontinuity. Therefore, it seems more consistent to attempt to solve the

problem for a transition layer of ﬁnite thickness and then take the limit when the thickness of

this layer ∆ tends to zero; i.e. consider the case of a density jump in the limit, ∆

0. The

→

solution for this transition layer gives us a more complete physical picture of the instability.

In this paper we consider the RT instability of a transition layer of ﬁnite thickness, where

the unperturbed density changes continuously from a constant value up to another one. For

that, an analytic solution is found, in the limit of small Atwood number. This solution allows

us to investigate the ∆

0 limit. We ﬁnd that:

→

1. For an arbitrary density proﬁle the “equivalent potential” can be presented in compact

form. This allowed us to predict a new type of symmetry (in addition to the well-known

symmetry of the Rayleigh equation [2]).

2. The depth of the “equivalent potential” well depends on the width of the transition layer

and the depth not the energy of the potential well undergoes a quantization. For the ﬁnite

width of the layer the spectrum of eigenvalues is inﬁnite. This conclusion is consistent with the

fact that with the increase of the quantum number grows the well depth.

3. The eigenfunctions found here show the exfoliation of the transition layer.

where ρ0(z) describes the equilibrium density proﬁle, v(z, t) is the z component of the perturbed

ﬂuid velocity, k is the wave number of the perturbed quantities which are chosen proportional

to eiky and g is the constant acceleration along negative z. Then one can ﬁnd the solution of

the above equation using separation of variables:

Then Eq. (1) reduces into two equations as follows:

v(z, t) = T (t)Φ(z).

where γ2 is the constant of separation, primes denote derivatives with respect to corresponding

arguments. The case γ2 > 0 corresponds to unstable modes.

The substitution

reduces Eq. (4) to the form of the Schrodinger equation as in [7]:

where

S(z) = e−kΓz√ρ0.

This form then allows us to prove the following symmetry properties of the Rayleigh equation

for arbitrary density proﬁles:

a) The substitutions

cause Eq. (9), and consequently Eq. (6), to remain unchanged. This means that every unstable

mode, Γ > 0, with the density proﬁle ρ0(z) can be compared with a stable, oscillating mode,

Γ < 0 (see Eqs. (3) , (8)), with the density proﬁle ρ0(z)e−4kΓz and vice versa. For the modiﬁed

proﬁle, on the other hand, the expression for the velocity (see Eqs. (2) , (5)) will contain an

additional factor e2kΓz.

b) Performing the substitution ρ0(z) by ρ0(

z)e4kΓz and then the transformation z

we ﬁnd that the potential (9) and Eq. (6) remain unchanged. Consequently the spectrum of the

→ −

eigenvalues for both proﬁles are the same, whereas eigenfunction of the latter can be obtained by

sending z

e−2kΓzΦ(z). Note that these symmetry properties hold only for ﬁxed Γn(n = 0, 1, 2, ...)

Consequently for a transition layer of ﬁnite width, δ

1, there is an inﬁnite spectrum of

≈

eigenvalues. Number of the extremum and zero points of the eigenfunctions (17) is equal to

n + 1 and n , respectively. For n > 0 the spatial dependence of the eigenfunction has oscillatory

character. It means that due to the instability, the monotonous distribution of the density in

the transition layer can be destroyed, and a stratiﬁed and multi-stream structure can be formed.

The velocity changes the direction as one goes from one new-formed sublayer to another. The

Figure shows the spatial distribution of the velocity (determined from the function Φ(z); see

Eq.

(2)) and the total density ρ(z) = ρ0(z) + ˜ρ(z) in such a stratiﬁed layer. The density

perturbation ˜ρ(z) is obtained from the continuity equation:

As we are concerned in the spatial dependence only, by plotting the ﬁgure we treated the

deﬁnite integral as constant (for simplicity we choose it as equal to one). If the width of the

transition layer is small, say

δ = k∆/2

A

1,

≤

≪

(21)

we can consider such a layer as a jump in density. However, in this case the analytic solution

of Eq. (15) fails. It is necessary to note that although the spectrum represented by Eq. (19) is

obtained for a broad transition layer, δ

A, (when we neglect the second term in the square

≫

brackets in Eq. (15)) Eq. (19) gives the correct expression for the main unstable mode in the

case of density jump, when δ

A. In fact as δ

0 from Eq. (19) it follows that the most

≪

→

unstable mode corresponds to the quantum number n = 0, and for the growth rate one obtains

the well-known expression [1, 2]:

γ =

kgA.

q

Such a general meaning of Eq. (19) can be explained by the fact that, for δ

1 , A

the “equivalent potential” in Eq.

(15) can be considered as a perturbation. The quantum

mechanical problem of particle motion in a one-dimensional well, whose depth is small, is

solved in [8] (see p. 162). There an equation for the determination of the eigenvalues of the

Schrodinger equation is obtained. That equation in our notation becomes:

(22)

≪

2δ =

dxV (x).

(23)

It is obvious that the second term of Eq. (15) doesn’t give any contribution in this integral

(this term is odd). The ﬁrst term gives the correct expression for the growth rate consistent

with Eq. (22). That is why for the small “equivalent potential”, (δ

1, A

1) the second

≪

≪

term in square brackets in Eq. (15) does not play any role in the determination of the growth

rate and the expression (19) is valid for a shallow well also.

We can summarize our results as follows:

1. The new symmetry properties found in this paper show new density proﬁles for which

the problem of instability can be reduced to the one and the same equation [3, 7, 9].

5

2. According to the symmetry theorem known up to now, the two proﬁles ρ0(z) and 1/ρ0(

z)

−

have the same set of eigenvalues but not eigenfunctions [2, 3, 9]. The symmetry properties found

here maintain the spectrum of eigenvalues and allow one to determine a relationship between

the eigenfunctions (see Eq. (5)).

3. The Eq. (10) shows that the inverse problem (obtaining the density proﬁle for known

perturbed quantity) is described by the same type of equation as the original problem.

4. From Eq. (17) it follows that for every eigenmode, there exists a unique transition layer

of stratiﬁed structure.

5. It should be interesting to extend this analysis when separation of variables is not used

and thus the spatial and temporal parts not treated independently.

These results are true not only for the chosen density proﬁle from Eq. (13) but also for any

density proﬁle whose corresponding “equivalent potential” has the form of a well.

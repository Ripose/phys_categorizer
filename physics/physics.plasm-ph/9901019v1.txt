1 Introduction

Construction of kinetic equations for dense gases and plasma is one of the most important
problem in the kinetic theory of classical systems. A consequent approach for construction
of kinetic equations has been done by Bogolubov [1]. This approach is based on a chain of
equations for s-particle distribution functions and on boundary conditions for weakening
correlations. Using such boundary conditions, we can in principle, express all s-particle
distribution functions in terms of the single-particle function and obtain for it a closed
kinetic equation. There is a large number of approaches for derivation of kinetic equations
[2, 3, 4, 5]. Despite a diﬀerence of these approaches between themselves in shape, the
weakening correlation principle in one or another form has been used in all approaches
just as in Bogolubov’s method. However, all these approaches are most eﬃcient in the
case when a small parameter (density, interaction, etc.) is present. For dense gases and
dense plasma small parameters are absent. In this case analysis of the BBGKY hierarchy
becomes very diﬃcult because we can not restrict ourselves to some ﬁnite number of
terms in expansion for the collision integral. Moreover, an additional problem, concerning
correct account in the collision integrals of interactions between particles on short as well
as long distances, arises.

Relatively recently an approach, based on a modiﬁcation of the weakening correlation
principle, has been proposed [6]. This approach leads to a consequent construction of
kinetic equations for dense gases without additional phenomenological assumptions. New
boundary condition to the BBGKY hierarchy take into account a non-equilibriumnes of
single particle distribution function as well as local conservation laws of mass, momentum
and energy, i.e., the quantities which constitute the basic for the hydrodynamic description
of evolution of the system. In the “pair collision” approximation, such approach leads
to an Enskog-like kinetic equation. Similar ideas have been proposed independently by
Karkheck, van Beijeren, de Schepper and Stell [7] at derivation of the kinetic equation for
the “square-well” potential. Somewhat diﬀerent modiﬁcation of Bogolubov’s approach
has been considered by Rudyak [8, 9]. Here, the Enskog-like kinetic equation for a system
of hard spheres has been obtained and attempts to extend this equation on a system with
soft potential have been made.

The ideas of work [6], which is based on Zubarev’s non-equilibrium statistical operator
method [10, 11], stimulate a revision of the problem connected with constructing of kinetic
equations for dense gases and plasma. Investigations [12, 13] were logical continuation of
the work [6] in which original result has been achieved: a consequent derivation of the
kinetic equation of revised Enskog theory [14, 15, 16] for a system of hard spheres.

In the present paper a kinetic equation for the single-particle distribution function
is obtained from the BBGKY hierarchy with modiﬁed boundary condition in the “pair
collision” approximation. This kinetic equation is valid for moderately dense classical
systems with the interparticle potential in a form of hard sphere potential plus some
long-range potential Φl(r).
In the case when Φl(r) is the Coulomb potential, we have
obtained a kinetic equation, called Enskog-Landau one, for a system of charged hard
spheres. Normal solutions of this equation are found by the Chapman-Enskog method.
On the basis of the solutions, analytical expressions for viscosity coeﬃcients and thermal
conductivity are obtained. Numerical calculations of transport coeﬃcients are performed
for neutral and ionized argon. The results are presented in a temperature dependent
form. A comparison between theoretically predicted values for transport coeﬃcient and
experimental data is examined.

2 Enskog-Landau kinetic equation

The BBGKY hierarchy of equations for non-equilibrium distribution functions of classical
interacting particles has been obtained in the paper [6] on the basis of assembling time
retarded solutions for Liouville equation with modiﬁed Bogolubov’s condition meaning
weakening correlations between particles. According to Zubarev’s non-equilibrium statis-
tical operator method [10, 11], full non-equilibrium distribution function ρ
for all
N particles of the system satisﬁes the following asymptotic condition:

is the quasi-equilibrium s-particle coordinate distribution function which depends on
n (r; t) and β (r; t) functionally. Due to the fact, that g1 (r1; t) = 1, the equation chain
(5) is distinguished from the ordinary BBGKY hierarchy [1] by the availability of sources
in the right-hand parts of the equations beginning from the second one and takes into
account both the one-particle and collective hydrodynamical eﬀects.

Let us consider the solution to equation chain (5) within the pair collision approxima-
tion. In this case, three- and higher-particle correlations are neglected, but environment
inﬂuence to the evolution of a chosen pair of particles is taken into consideration by means
of application of the boundary condition. Then from (5) for f2 (x1, x2; t) we obtain [6]:

f2 (x1, x2; t) = εg2 (r1, r2; t) f1 (x1; t) f1 (x2; t) .

is the collision integral. We must emphasize that equation (9) is needed to be adjusted
with the equation for binary quasi-equilibrium distribution function g2 (r1, r2; t). Ac-
cording to (3) and (6) this function functionally depends on n (r; t), ˆ
Eint (r; t) (or on
β (r; t)). Besides it was shown, that quasi-equilibrium correlation distribution function
h2 (r1, r2; t), which is related to g2 (r1, r2; t) (h2 = g2 −
1), satisﬁes the Ornstein-Zernike
equation [12]. In paper [18] a non-equilibrium grand canonical distribution for the system
of hard spheres and on the base of methods of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics [19] an

paper [12]. New equation for h2(r1, r2; t) is an analogue of Ornstein-Zernike equation
in equilibrium statistical mechanics [19]. This equation for the hard sphere system in
equilibrium case has exact solution in Percus-Yevick approximation [12].

In the paper [6] some special cases were considered, when the interparticle interaction
potential Φkj is modelled as the hard sphere potential Φhs (
) for particles with diameter

σ. Then taking into account the singularity of the hard sphere potential (τ
is collision time) it was shown for the ﬁrst time how the collision integral (10) transforms
into collision integral of revised Enskog theory (RET) [14]:

where ˆT hs(1, 2) is the Enskog’s collision operator for hard spheres, ghs
2 (r1, r2; t) is the
pair quasiequilibrium distribution function of hard spheres, which depends on the average
non-equilibrium density n (r; t) functionally. It is important to emphasize that H-theorem
for the kinetic equation (9) with the Enskog collisions integral (11) has been proved by
P.R´esibois [15, 16].

In the same paper [6] another case was also considered, when the interparticle interac-
tion potential is modelled as a sum of a short-range potential (hard spheres, for example)
and some long-range smooth potential;

If Φl(
is the Coulomb potential, equation (12) with structure of (16) is a
generalization of Landau collision integral without divergency for short-range distances
between particles (that is diﬀerent from the usual Landau collision integral [3, 20] because
short-range interactions are taken into account correctly). Therefore we can call such
kinetic equation (9) with collision integral (12) as the Enskog-Landau kinetic equation for
the system of charged hard spheres. It is necessary to emphasize that in equation (16)
the long-range divergency still remains. To avoid this problem sequentially we have to
consider kinetic equation with taking into account of dynamical screening eﬀects [2, 3].
But this way is impossible in Enskog-Landau kinetic equation. Only one we can do for
further calculation is to change upper integral limit to some ﬁnite value, which could have
a meaning of value of statical screening in our system (see below). solve this problem we
must consider dynamical screening eﬀects.

3 Normal solution. Transport coeﬃcients

We shall solve the equation (9) by means of iterations. Therefore a set of hydrodynamical
variables should be introduced for reduced description of the system: hydrodynamical
density of mass, momentum and kinetic energy [4, 21]. The conservation laws are to be
written down after multiplication of both left and right parts of equation (9) by com-

ponents of additive invariant vector m, mv as well as by kinetic energy
and after
integrating over v [4, 21]. The local-equilibrium Maxwell distribution function may be

æ, η, and λ coincide with respective quantities obtained by solving Boltzmann’s equation
for low density systems of point-like charged particles [21]. If Z = 0, then we obtain the
results of RET-theory [14].

4 Numerical calculations

The numerical calculations were carried out for the viscosities æ (33), η (34) and thermal
conductivity λ (36), where the dense once-ionized argon was chosen as a dense one-

obtained results were compared with [23]. In these papers dense neutral argon was con-
sidered.
Its atoms were modelled as hard spheres, and obtained results are in a good
agreement with [23] if the theory parameter σ is chosen correctly.

The screening radius D was not chosen as a Debye-like one, because such approximation
can give for high densities incorrect values being less than σ. Therefore it is presented in
the form, that was proposed in [25], where the hard spheres diameter is also taken into

Such substitution of σ, D and g2(σ, n) allows to obtain transport coeﬃcients as functions
of density n and temperature T . The behaviours of æ, η and λ were investigated for
various values of n and T including regions mentioned in [23], but only for the case giving
value of D greater than σ. The purpose of these calculations was to study the dependence
of æ, η and λ on the long-range potential when the density is high. As was expected the
behaviour of such transport coeﬃcients in these regions appears to be rather smooth and
monotonous. But the small deviation is observed between our results and comparative
ones when the long interaction is “switched on”. Transport coeﬃcients appear to be
slightly sensitive to including the long-range potential. They decrease slowly being of the
same order. These behaviour coincide with expectations.

We note that the numerical calculation for æ, η and λ was carried out and compared
with data from [26, 27, 28]. As one can see from the ﬁgures below, the good coincidence of
both data is observed in the “high”-temperature region. Theory parameter σ for diﬀerent

choosing σ more precise but in general case σ is the function of n, T , Z and ﬁnding for
this dependence is a microscopic problem.

As it can be seen from the ﬁgures below, the most essential deviations between of
theoretical calculations from the experimental data arise in the low-temperature region
for η (ﬁgure 1) and for λ (ﬁgure 2). In real physical systems at low temperature one can
approach to gas-liquid phase transition point. But our theory is not applicable within
critical region near point of phase transition. Except that there is no phase transition in
one-component system with only repulsive potential on the contrary to real systems. So
our theory works well for description of transport processes at high temperatures far from
phase transition point of corresponding real systems.

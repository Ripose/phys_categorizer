Abstract

Real dusty crystals are inhomogeneous due to the presence of external forces.

We suggest approximations for calculations of diﬀerent types of inhomoge-

neous DC (chain and DC with a few slabs) in the equilibrium state. The

results are in a good agreement with experimental results and can be used as

an eﬀective diagnostic method for many dusty systems.

I. INTRODUCTION

Formation of dust crystals (DC) takes place in a vertical electric ﬁeld of the sheath, the

gravitational ﬁeld and a horizontal electrical ﬁeld. The external ﬁeld, acting in vertical and

horizontal traps, stabilizes the 3-dimensional DC of ﬁnite size and linear chains of d-ions

(horizontal traps for conﬁnement of one-dimensional DC are used in [1,2]). The pressure

of the boundaries and the external ﬁeld violate the translational invariance and lead to a

dependence of the distances between nearest neighbors in the lattice of dust particles on the

position of the particles (see Fig.1 and Fig.2). Therefore macroscopic inhomogeneity in a

lattice is a new phenomenon not present in the usual inﬁnite (very large) crystal.

Even in the approximation of central force for interparticle interaction between d-ions,

1

DC possess a layered structure (the layered structure of usual atomic crystals, as graphite,

is connected with the anisotropy of the interparticle interaction).

The vertical and horizontal distances between nearest neighbours (lattice “constants” Rk

and R⊥) are in general diﬀerent functions of position in diﬀerent directions from the center

of the crystal (center of inertia). Deformation of DC in the ﬁelds of the traps depends on

its characteristics and on the plasma parameters. Therefore the electrostrictional response

of d-ion systems on a static external disturbance can be used as a diagnostic tool for DC

and the surrounding plasma. In particular the charge Q of d-ions, the screening length RD,

the concentration of the small ions and the electric ﬁeld in the sheath can be determined.

In the present paper the possibility to use the inhomogeneity of DC for plasma diagnostics

is considered theoretically.

Recently dusty plasma diagnostics appear on basis of investigations of the dispersion

curves ω(k) for d-ion sound [3] and properties of forced oscillations of linear d-ion’s chains in

an electric ﬁeld [1] and under the action of laser impulses [2]. The static diagnostic, suggested

in this paper is simpler for the theoretical description and experimental realization than the

dynamic sounding considered in [1–3].

For the description of a lattice conﬁguration of N d-ions in a state of deformation under

action of external gravitational and electric forces fn =

Vn and interparticles forces

−∇

Fn =

Un we will use the balance equations. Here Vn is the potential energy of the d-ion

−∇

with number n, Un is the potential energy of interaction between the d-ion with number

n and all other ones. We do not take into account the force connected with momentum

transfer from the small ions to the d-ions. This force very often can be omitted, because in

the case when it is essential, the d-ions can be found not only below the sheath, but also on

top of it, which is not observed in the experiment discussed below.

We will use the simple approximation of nearest neighbours for the description of inter-

particle interaction. This approximation apparently gives a good picture of the inhomogene-

ity of DC under the action of external forces and with a screening length RD

R⊥, Rk. We

∼

also will neglect a possible dependence of the d-ion charge Q on the location in the inhomo-

2

geneous DC (w.r.t. d-ion density). Therefore we suggest Q = const in our considerations.

II. EQUATIONS OF STATIC EQUILIBRIUM

For the case of inhomogeneous three-dimensional DC we will use a simple quasi-one-

dimensional model of DC, in which the layer lattice with a real potential is changed into

a one-dimensional vertical chain of particles. The eﬀective potential for this model can be

calculated by integration of the interaction with the nearest layer with distributed charge

This model permits to calculate the dependence of the distances between the nearest

Here we take into account only interaction between neighbouring particles. The potential

energy for a horizontal chain of N interacting d-ions in the electric ﬁeld of the trap, has an

analogous form and stabilizes this chain in the x-direction (zk

Here X0 is the center of inertia for a chain and ω0 is a parameter, which determines

the shape of the pit. According to [4] the vertical electric ﬁeld in a sheath changes linearly

with the height. This dependence is realized approximately in the regions not too close

to the lower electrode and the border of the presheath: the quadratic approximation for

the potential ϕ(z) in the plasma layer is also used in [5,6] for the analysis of the equations

of motion of DC . Therefore in the case of a vertical potential well we use in eq.(4) the

As follows from eq.(8) the intervals Rk are symmetric with respect to the center:

R1 = RN −1, R2 = RN −2,

III. STRUCTURE OF DC WITH AN ATTRACTIVE (FOR LARGE DISTANCES)

AND WITH A PURELY REPULSIVE POTENTIAL

According to eqs.(4), (8) for isolated systems of d-ions (V ′

k = 0), there are two diﬀerent

possibilities when external ﬁelds are absent.

If the pair interaction between d-ions is a nonmonotonic function and leads to repulsion

at small distances and to attraction at large distances, then the solution of eq.(4) reads

1 = U ′
U ′

2 = ... = U ′

N −1 = 0

(9)

.

This solution describes a homogeneous chain of N d-ions with equal distances between

nearest neighbours R1 = R2 = ... = RN −1 = R0. The potential energy has a minimum

for this state. In this case the weakly inhomogeneous conﬁgurations of d-ions with external

If the pair interaction U(Rk) has a monotonic purely repulsive form, the d-ions of an

isolated system are unstable and, according to (9) all Rk are inﬁnite. In this case stabilization

of the system in a weak external ﬁeld playing the role of a trap, leads also to a slightly

inhomogeneous state, in which the deviations of the intervals from the average are small,

IV. SOLUTIONS AND NUMERICAL RESULTS

A general solution of the equations in ﬁnite diﬀerences (13) can be obtained in the form

sk = R0 −

Rk = R0 + Aekt + Be−kt.

(14)

Taking into account the symmetry of the system sk = sN −k, the connection between

the coeﬃcients B = AeN t can be found. The coeﬃcient A can be found from the boundary

Therefore in the parabolic trap formed by the external forces, a chain of d -ions is

For suﬃciently long (N

1) horizontal chains and for (in vertical direction) quasi-one-

dimensional dusty crystals the proﬁle distributions of charge density and mass and thereby

the “constants” of the elastic forces can be obtained in the approximation of continuous

media by use of eqs.(16), (17). The surface density of charge is proportional to to the mass

density and therefore there is balance of the external volume electric and gravitational forces

in each point of a horizontal plane at ﬁxed height. This means that even inhomogeneous

planes (Fig.1) and horizontal chains (Fig.2), which are more dense in the center, are not

suspended in the central part of the dusty system, where the density is higher. Enlargement

of the density in the center of horizontal crystalline planes is observed in the experiments [7],

but quantitative measurements are unknown to us. Parallel to oscillation and wave measure-

ments in horizontal chains, the equilibrium positions of d-ions have also been determined in

the electric ﬁeld of a horizontal trap [1,2,8]. According to the data of these papers for the

7

case N = 12 the ratios of the intervals between neighbouring d-ions in the direction of the

center are R1 : R2 : ...R6 = 1.44 : 1.22 : 1.11 : 1.05 : 1.01 : 1.00. These results are reasonably

described by our formula (15), in which for t = 0.18 (and correspondingly ω0 = 0.2Ω) these

ratios are 1.43 : 1.27 : 1.15 : 1.07 : 1.02 : 1.00.

The experimental data for the other half of the chain R6 : R7 : ...R11 = 1 : 1.01 : 1.01 :

1.08 : 1.20 : 1.32 agree less with our theory for the (with respect to the center) symmetric

chain and they are essentially diﬀerent from the experimental data for the ﬁrst half of the

chain. We think that this asymmetry is a consequence of the asymmetric and not exactly

Using the data on the equilibrium conﬁguration Rn and the parameter of the trap ω0 = 6.15

For the chain with N = 4 the experimental data, according to [1,8], give ω0 = 6.25 s−1

and R1 = 1989 µm, R2 = 1910 µm, R3 = 2031 µm. The average interval R⊥ = 1960 µm for

the case N = 4 is twice as large as R⊥ = 103 µm for the chain with N = 12. This is probably

connected with the higher charges (almost three times) of the d-ions in [1] and therefore with

the stronger repulsion between them at the partially same compressing external ﬁeld of the

horizontal trap. For the conditions of the experiments [1] the asymmetry of the external

ﬁeld, connected with the nonquadratic form of the potential V (x) is still stronger than

in [2] and this was the reason to use for the bordering intervals the expression

/R2 = 1 + ω2

It is necessary to emphasize that all the results for the case N = 4 and N = 12 are

applicable for both cases: purely repulsive d

The known experimental data on equilibrium intervals Rk between neighbouring ions in

vertical traps concern only dust crystals with two horizontal crystalline planes (N = 2) and

thickness of the crystal was not measured.

Using the experimental data [5] for m, Q, R⊥ = 450 µm, Rk = 360 µm we estimate

In the case of a dust crystal with a lower m, Q and

R⊥ = 350 µm, Rk = 280 µm (see also [5]) we ﬁnd RD = 933 µm. Therefore the Debye

length RD is approximately of the order of the interval between nearest d-ions, which is in

The moving of a dust crystal inside the sheath can be observed by diﬀerent microgravity

experiments (see some discussion for example in [9]).

We suggest here some experiments in which the properties of DC can be studied under

conditions of microgravity and even changing gravity.

One of these experiments (under terrestrial conditions) can be performed in a horizontal

discharge, where in the horizontal direction there is only an electric force and momentum

transfer from the small ions to the dust particles. For such experiment the latter force can

be very essential in contrast to the conditions considered in this paper.

The second group of experiments is connected with the eﬀective gravity created in space

stations by rotation of dusty plasma. If h and geﬀ are the distance from the axis of rotation

to the negative electrode and the acceleration of the center of inertia for the dusty system

respectively, the obvious connection is given by

description (27)-(28).

V. CONCLUSIONS.

The method of dusty plasma diagnostics discussed above and based on an analysis of the

inhomogeneity of the linear structures of d-ions, seems very attractive. In contrast to the

situation in the usual sound method, the d-ions of a small dust crystal or a linear dust chain

have additional degrees of freedom. It gives the possibility to extract additional information

from the static response (change of the equilibrium distances between the d-ions) or the

dynamic response (oscillations and waves in inhomogeneous structures). The sounding by

small clusters of d-ions cannot change essentially the plasma parameters (although some

distortion of the micro-ﬁeld in the plasma can be stimulated by the traps, which stabilize the

d-clusters). The advantage of static diagnostics is the simplicity of the measurements of the

inhomogeneous structure and the simple connection with the parameters of the interaction

between d-ions, their shielding and the characteristics of rf plasma. The precise theoretical

consideration of the dynamical experiments [1,3], which are based on the excitation of the

eigenmodes in linear chains and dust crystals, seems a more complicated problem.

We would like to stress that the most general consideration of the equilibrium inho-

mogeneous conﬁgurations of dusty systems can be based on translationally non-invariant

solutions of the connected system of kinetic equations for plasmas and Poisson’s equation,

where the separation between an external ﬁeld and d

d interaction is absent. The equilib-

−

rium positions for the d-ions can be found as the points of space where the self-consistent

electric ﬁeld is in balance with gravity. However, this program is too complicated and, as we

showed, not necessary for a reasonable theoretical description of the existing experiments.

We are grateful to Dr. A.Melzer for fruitful discussions and private communications

about the experimental results. We also would like to thank Dr. H.Thomas and Dr. J.Goree

for private communications connected with the papers [9–11].

Abstract

The results of a theoretical investigation on the stopping power of ion pair
in a magnetized electron plasma are presented, with particular emphasis on
the two-ion correlation eﬀects. The analysis is based on the assumptions that
the magnetic ﬁeld is classically strong (λB ≪ ac ≪ λD, where λB, ac and λD
are respectively the electron de Broglie wavelength, Larmor radius and Debye
length) and that the velocity of the two ions is identical and ﬁxed. The stopping
power and vicinage function in a plasma are computed by retaining two-ion
correlation eﬀects and is compared with the results of the individual-projectile
approximation.

The problem of the interaction of a beam of fast charged particles with a
plasma has been attracting more and more interest in the last years in connec-
tion with the proposed scheme of inertial conﬁnement fusion based on the use
of heavy-ion beams to drive the DT target towards the ignition conditions [1].
Several physical situations can be conceived in which the beam ions are
closely spaced so that their stopping in the ionized medium is not exactly that
of charged particles whose dynamics is independent of the presence of each
other, but suﬀers from mutual correlations [2, 3]. It can be the case of very
high-density ion beams or, more realistically, when ion clusters are to be used
instead of standard ion beams [4].

The nature of experimental plasma physics is such that experiments are
usually performed in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds, and consequently it is of
interest to investigate the eﬀects of a magnetic ﬁeld on the stopping power.
The strong magnetic ﬁelds used in laboratory investigations of plasmas can
appreciably inﬂuence the processes determined by Coulomb collisions [5]. This
inﬂuence is even more important in white dwarfs and in neutron stars, the
magnetic ﬁelds on the surfaces of which can attain strengths up to 105-1010kG.
The stopping of uncorrelated charged particles in a magnetized plasma has
been the subject of several papers [6-9]. The stopping of a fast test particle
moving with a velocity u much higher than the electron thermal velocity vT was
studied in [6, 8]. The energy loss of a charged particle moving with arbitrary
velocity was studied in [7]. The expression derived there for the Coulomb
logarithm corresponds to the classical description of collisions.

In ref.

[9] expressions were derived describing the stopping power of a
slow charged particle in Maxwellian plasma with a classically strong (but not
quantizing) magnetic ﬁeld (λB ≪ ac ≪ λD, where λB, ac and λD are respec-
tively the electron de Broglie wavelength, Larmor radius and Debye length),
under conditions such that the scattering processes must be described quantum-
mechanically.

Here we present an evaluation of the stopping power of a ion pair moving in
a warm collisionless plasma placed in a classical strong homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld, with the aim to show under which conditions correlation eﬀects can be
important and how they modify the single-particle expression of the stopping
power.

A uniform plasma is considered in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld B0 which is assumed suﬃciently strong so that λB ≪ ac ≪ λD. From these
conditions we can obtain 3 · 10−6n1/2
0 < B0 < 105T (n0 and T are respectively
unperturbed number density and temperature of plasma), where n0 is measured
in cm−3, T is measured in eV and B0 in kG. Because of this assumption, the
perpendicular cyclotron motion of the ions and plasma electrons is neglected.
Let us analyze the interaction process of a two-ion system moving in plasma.
The interionic vector is l. Also, due to the high frequencies involved, the very
weak response of the plasma ions is neglected and the Vlasov-Poisson equations
to be solved for the perturbation to the electron distribution function, f1, and
the potential ϕ, are as follows:

where b is the unit vector parallel to B0, f0 is the unperturbed electron distribu-
tion function which is taken to be uniform and Maxwellian, u is the velocity of
two ions. Here, Z1e and Z2e are the eﬀective charges of the two ions, assumed
to be constant throughout the slowing-down process.

By solving the eqs. (1) and (2) in space-time Fourier components, we obtain

the following expression for the electrostatic potential:

The stopping power of the ion pair can be computed by summing up the
forces acting on two ions, due to the electric ﬁeld induced in the plasma; it
reads

There are two contributions to the stopping power of two ions. The ﬁrst one
is the uncorrelated particle contribution and represents the energy loss of the
two projectiles due to the coupling with collective plasma modes (the ﬁrst term
in eq. (5)). The second contribution is responsible for the correlated motion of
two ions by means of the resonant interaction with the excited plasma waves
(the second term in eq. (5)). Both terms are responsible of the irreversible
transfer of the two-ion energy to plasma through resonant electrons.

The stopping properties of the medium can be also conveniently described

in terms of the partial range deﬁned as follows:

(6)

(8)

where Ein is the injection ion energy and E is the actual value of the ion energy
during the slowing-down process. For E ∼= 0, R(0) gives the penetration depth
(range) of the incident particle.

Ein − E

Let us begin with the evaluation of the stopping power of two ions with
the same eﬀective charge Ze. For an arbitrary relative position of the two test
ions, the expressions of the uncorrelated (proportional to Sind) and correlated
(proportional to Scorr) stopping powers of the ion pair becomes:

J0(z) is the Bessel function of the zero order, ϑ is the angle between the interi-
onic vector l and the velocity vector u, L = l/λD, λ = u/vT , s = kmaxλD with
kmax = 1/rmin, where rmin is the eﬀective minimum impact parameter. Here
kmax has been introduced to avoid the divergence of the integral caused by the
incorrect treatment of the short-range interactions between the ion pair and
the plasma electrons within the linearized Vlasov theory. The value of kmax,
will be 1/ac for fusion plasmas, since the magnetized plasma approximation
which neglects the perpendicular motion of the electrons ceases to be valid for
collision parameters less than ac.

Consistently with the notation introduced above we separate the single-
particle contribution from the correlated one of the stopping power. Then,
deﬁning the interference or vicinage function χ(l) as [2, 3]

expression (5) can be put in the form

χ(l, ϑ, λ) =

Scorr(l, ϑ, λ)
Sind(λ)

,

S = 2Z 2Sind(λ) (1 + χ(l)) .

Here, χ describes the intensity of correlation eﬀects with respect to uncorrelated
situation. In the case of the fast ions (λ ≫ 1), from expressions (9) and (10)
we obtain:

For two values of the orientation angle ϑ = 00 and ϑ = 900 the expression (14)

where J1(z) is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst order.

Fig. 1 shows χ as a function of L and ϑ for λ = 10 and s = 10. It is shown
that χ can decrease or increase for large ϑ-value, depending on the interionic
distance l (see also expressions (15) and (16)). Meanwhile, the correlation
eﬀects decrease for large ϑ-value in plasma in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld [2].
It should be clear that this eﬀect is accounted by the character of electrostatic
potential of test charged particles in magnetized plasma. As shown in [12], in the
frame of the test particle, moving in a plasma placed in the strong magnetic ﬁeld
(ac < λD), the part of spatially oscillatory potential has spherical symmetry
over the hemisphere behind the particle and is zero ahead of the particle. The
second part has diﬀerent character, which makes the potential continuous at the
plane containing the particle, is oscillatory in the radial direction, but decreases
almost monotonically in the axial direction.

Figs. 2 and 3 show χ as a function of λ, in the cases of ϑ = 00 and ϑ = 900
respectively, for diﬀerent values of L. As expected, correlation eﬀects increase
in the high-velocity limit or for small L-values. In the cases of ϑ = 150, ϑ = 450
and ϑ = 750, the correlation eﬀect between two protons is shown in Fig. 4,
where the total range R(0) is shown as a function of L. The parameters are:
Ein = 9.2M eV , T = 100eV , n0 = 1022cm−3, B0 = 106kG (such conditions are
possible on the surface of a neutron star). The halving of R(0) (corresponding to
the doubling of the stopping power), with respect to the case of two uncorrelated
protons, is shown. It should be clear that test-ion densities corresponding to
l ∼= u/ωp are unrealistic for conventional ion beams. However, small interionic
distances (∼= 10−8cm) occur in clusters [4].

The basic character of diﬀusive transport in a magnetised plasma de-
pends on what kind of transport is modelled. ExB turbulence under drift

ordering has special characteristics: it is nearly incompressible, and it can-
not lead to magnetic ﬂux diﬀusion if it is electrostatic. The ExB velocity

is also related to the Poynting energy ﬂux. Under quasineutral dynamics,
electric ﬁelds are not caused by transport of electric charge but by the re-

quirement that the total current is divergence free. Consequences for well
constructed computational transport models are discussed in the context of
a general mean ﬁeld analysis, which also yields several anomalous transfer

mechanisms not normally considered by current models.

I. Introduction — Transport as Turbulent Diﬀusion

Transport of thermal energy and particles in magnetically conﬁned, laboratory plas-
mas is well known to be anomalous: much larger than transport by collisional diﬀusion
and appearing with diﬀerent scaling characteristics [1,2]. Modelling of this transport is
usually done in terms of the two ﬂuid Braginskii equations [3], but by substituting either
empirical or theoretical models for the diﬀusivity coeﬃcients [4]. The transport process
is assumed by the models to have the same character as the collisional diﬀusion process,
including the prospect that Onsager symmetry should hold [5]. It is important to note
that the transport process is assumed by such a model to have the same character as the
collisional diﬀusion process. Many of the results of kinetic transport theory rest on the
assumption that ﬂuctuations in the thermodynamic state variables are small enough to be
neglected in the energy budget and that they are randomly correlated with each other.

Small scale, low frequency drift turbulence involving eddies, waves, or vortices of the

ExB velocity,

vE =

c
B2 B×∇φ,

(1)

where at drift scales the perpendicular electric ﬁeld is E⊥ = −∇φ, is a fundamentally
diﬀerent process from this. Rather than involving dissipation directly, the ExB eddies
advect the background thermal gradient to produce disturbances in all the thermodynamic
state variables. The disturbances are then carried with the ﬂows for as long as the eddies
last. Then, they are picked up by new eddies and carried further. This does have the nature
of a diﬀusive process if the size of the eddies and their lifetime are small and short compared
to the scales of the background, and the net time-averaged transport does indeed scale with
the background gradients if the turbulence is local [6]. Moreover, although the dynamics of
the turbulence is robustly nonlinear, the relative amplitudes of the disturbances are indeed
small because the plasma is magnetised; the relative amplitudes e
pe/pe, for the
electrostatic potential and electron pressure for example, need only be so large as the ratio
of the local drift scale, ρs, to the background gradient scale length, Lp, both deﬁned by

φ/Te or

e

ρ2
s =

Lp = |∇ log pe|−1

(2)

in order to be so nonlinear. Typical measured values of these ﬂuctuation amplitudes are
of order one to ten percent, rising towards the edge of a conﬁned plasma due to the
fact that Lp becomes much smaller than the nominal parallel length scale qR (the ﬁeld
line pitch parameter times the major radius of a toroidal plasma) and the perpendicular
drift dynamics is more able to compete with the dissipation incurred through the parallel

2

electron dynamics [7]. Nevertheless, the strong nature of the coupling mechanisms between

the state variables (especially

pe and

φ) means that the basic properties of this turbulence

are those of nonlinear drift waves [8,9], under drift ordering — the scale of the turbulence

is short compared to that of the background gradients and the relative amplitude of the

e

e

ﬂuctuations in the thermodynamics quantities is small [10]. Drift wave turbulence involves
dynamics on scales which are proportional but not necessarily equal to ρs for space and
cs/Lp for time, for plasmas which have both the local drift parameter, δ, and the electron
dynamical beta, βe, as small parameters. These two parameters and the sound speed, cs,
are given by

δ =

where vA is the Alfv´en velocity. The presence of Te and Mi reﬂects coupling between
electron thermal dynamics and ion inertia. Even with ﬁnite ion temperature Ti 6= Te, the
coupling between the electron pressure and the electric ﬁeld keeps ρs and cs/Lp as the
typical scaling parameters of the disturbances. This coupling and the fact that one of the

dynamical state variables (

φ) serves simultaneously as the potential for the electric ﬁeld

and the stream function for the (essentially incompressible) ﬂow eddies are the two most

important properties of drift wave turbulence. These properties and the result that the

e

disturbances are not statistically independent of each other have consequences concerning

the nature of the transport process. Our interest in this article is to explore how these

properties diﬀer from those of the kinetic diﬀusion process behind classical (and neoclas-

sical) transport processes, and what implications this has for well constructed transport

models.

II. The Basic Character of Small Scale ExB Flow Transport

There are a number of fundamental properties of ExB drift turbulence which suggest

that the transport they cause should be qualitatively diﬀerent from random thermal trans-

port. First, if conventional drift ordering holds the velocity is nearly incompressible. If
the magnetic ﬁeld is straight then the divergence ∇ · vE vanishes entirely. In a toroidal
device, the divergence carries the scale of the major radius:

∇ · vE = ∇ ·

c
B2 B×∇φ ≈ −vE · ∇ log B

∼ R−1vE

Since in the conﬁnement zone the pressure scale length, Lp is much smaller, we have

if Lp ≪ R

e

Here, we assume that the scale of a signiﬁcant divergence of the transport ﬂux is Lp rather
than the much smaller scale of ExB disturbances, because a locally divergence free state

for the ﬂuxes should be established on the relatively fast time scale of the turbulence,
not the transport. By contrast, a diﬀusive ﬂux of the form nevD = −D∇ne is always
compressible, as it can be derived from a potential.

The second important characteristic is that the ExB velocity is also involved in the

Poynting energy ﬂux,

vE =

c
B2 E×B =

1
ρv2
A

c

E×B
4π

(6)

with ρ the mass density. Due to the close force balance for small scale disturbances in
drift dynamics, there is a cancellation between the Poynting ﬂux and one factor of p vE
in the total thermal energy ﬂux. This has the consequence that alone among transport

mechanisms, for ExB drift turbulence the advective part of the thermal energy ﬂux appears

with a factor of 3/2, not 5/2, times the temperature times the particle ﬂux [11]. More

speciﬁcally, its energetic coupling to the thermal reservoir is mediated through its small,

quasistatic divergence, so that the pressure does little work on elemental volumes of the

ﬂuid.

A third characteristic of ExB turbulent transport also arises from the connection be-

tween the ﬂow stream function and the electric ﬁeld: anomalous energy exchange channels

between the electron and ion thermal energies. The basic mechanism underlying drift

waves is the coupling between electron pressure and electrostatic disturbances through the

parallel current:

pe ↔

Jk ↔

φ. The second step in this is the Alfv´enic coupling

Jk ↔

φ

which is present in MHD. The ﬁrst step is the adiabatic coupling

Jk, part of which

is the adiabatic response in the Ohm’s law, by which pressure disturbances launch shear

pe ↔

e

e

e

e

Alfv´en waves along the background magnetic ﬁeld due to the force balance for electrons

e

e

parallel to the ﬁeld. This adiabatic coupling is responsible for a high degree of correlation

between the electrostatic potential and electron pressure disturbances, and it provides the

means by which the free energy in the background gradient is passed to the ExB turbu-

lence [6,9]. It can only be addressed by a proper two ﬂuid model which treats electron

and ion dynamics separately but self consistently. Since the ExB drift kinetic energy is

essentially in the ions, and the conservation of charge keeps the dynamics quasineutral, a

parallel current divergence in the Alfv´en dynamics is balanced by a polarisation current

divergence in the ions, and this can do work on the ion ﬂuid. Through the disturbances,

electron thermal energy taken out of the background gradient can be deposited in the ions.

4

A fourth characteristic of ExB ﬂows is that they cannot cause magnetic ﬂux diﬀusion

unless there is a signiﬁcant amount of reconnection of magnetic ﬁeld lines in the presence

of a current gradient (that is, the drive mechanism should be this current gradient, rather

than the thermal gradients as for drift turbulence). The magnetic ﬂux occurs through
the inductive part of the electric ﬁeld in the force balance for electrons, that is, ∂Ak/∂t.
Neglecting dissipation and electron inertia the Ohm’s law is

− ∇kφ

(7)

In an average over a closed ﬂux surface the right hand side vanishes unless there are

appreciable magnetic disturbances. When the disturbances follow from drift dynamics the

relative phase shifts are such that magnetic transport eﬀects tend to cancel out of the

ﬂux surface averages. Only when the current gradient is available as an energy source do

these processes lead to appreciable transport, even if the thermal transport is robustly

anomalous. By contrast, random thermal diﬀusion transports magnetic ﬂux by the same
mechanism as for particles and energy, and the ﬂux diﬀusivity, ηkc2/4π, is even larger than
the ﬂuid diﬀusivities, proportional to De = ρ2

eνe, by a factor of β−1
e .

Two further considerations involve the development of large scale ExB ﬂows within the

ﬂux surfaces (we assume that the equilibrium is quiescent enough that there is no bulk ﬂow

across ﬂux surfaces beyond the existence of the turbulence). For dynamics at drift scales,

the disturbances as well as the background are deeply quasineutral. Charge diﬀerences are

neutralised on time and space scales which are eﬀectively arbitrarily small, so that while

there can be nonvanishing electric ﬁelds, there is no signiﬁcant charge density.

In this

context it is inappropriate to speak of a radial electric ﬁeld generated by the divergence

of a radial current. Rather, we have the constraint that the total current is divergence

free, so that various pieces of the current which might have a divergence are balanced by a

divergence in the polarisation current of the ions. This is relatively well known in a general

sense, but we will illustrate it here speciﬁcally for the problem of mean ﬂow generation. If

source or loss mechanisms for either of the charge species are considered, these should be

thought of as a torque on the ExB vorticity rather than a charge generation[12].

Finally, anomalous transport in the ExB vorticity results fundamentally from anoma-

lous viscosity, either the ﬂuid Reynolds stress or some correction arising from gyroviscosity.

Under ﬂux surface and short time scale averaging, it is a matter of the total radial polari-

sation drift (linear plus nonlinear) necessarily vanishing. An anomalous resistivity cannot

lead to anomalous transport of ExB ﬂows or, equivalently, generation of a radial electric

5

ﬁeld. This is a direct consequence of the fact that resistivity is a momentum conserving

friction between electrons and ions.

In the rest of this article, we address the general equations of transport by small scale

drift turbulence via mean ﬁeld theory, and then underscore the above points via analysis

of these equations.

III. Global Fluid Drift Equations and Energy Conservation

The general derivation of ﬂuid drift equations for large scale motion proceeds similarly

to the local treatments more familiar from the turbulence studies [8,9]. The the diﬀerence

is mainly that we must keep track of the variability of the coeﬃcients which depend on

densities or temperatures. The density is the most important of these.

It carries the

consequence that the ion polarisation drift must be retained in advection if exact energy

conservation is to hold. This result follows from the fact that proper consideration of the

electron force balance (the adiabatic response) disallows the use of the more familiar MHD

ordering in the derivation of global equations [13,14,15]. What we must do is to generalise
suﬃciently to retain a consistent superset of both approaches.

We begin with a neutral, single-component plasma with ions of mass Mi and charge
state Z and electrons of mass me. For this treatment we will neglect electron inertia but
keep me in combination with νe in the formulae for the dissipative ﬂuxes. The densities
satisfy ne = Zni. We assume that the local drift parameter, δ, and the electron dynamical
beta, βe, deﬁned in the Introduction, are small. In contrast to the familiar situation with
drift equation models, no assumption concerning ﬂute mode ordering in the derivatives

is made during the derivation of the equations themselves and their energy theorem con-
cerning spatial scales, even for B. The more familiar assumption of kk ≪ k⊥, or for a
toroidally conﬁned plasma Lp ≪ R, is reserved for evaluating the properties of the trans-
port considering that the disturbances involved in the turbulence do indeed satisfy local

drift ordering.

The drift approximation basically states that perpendicular compressional wave dy-

namics is arbitrarily fast compared to the physics of interest and is therefore neglected
in favor of a quasistatically evolving force balance perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld

lines. We therefore have a quasistatic perpendicular electric ﬁeld, with magnetic induction

appearing only in the parallel component,

E⊥ = −∇⊥φ

Ek = −

− ∇kφ

(8)

Correspondingly, the total magnetic ﬁeld, Bt, is given by the background, plus the principal
disturbance arising from Ak, plus a small compressional piece which evolves quasistatically,
plus an even smaller correction needed to ensure that ∇ · Bt = 0,

Bt = B −

respectively. The symbols B and B give the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld and its magnitude,
while b is reserved for the combination of B and the piece involving Ak, given by

The compressional part of the magnetic ﬁeld, involving

B, is written for generality but

not used in a βe ≪ 1 treatment (it can be used to evaluate the Poynting energy ﬂux in
the energy theorem by assuming that ∇2
⊥ of the sum B2 + 8πp is zero). The divergence
correction, involving χB, is never used; it is written only to preserve ∇ · Bt = 0, and in
practice it is always negligibly small.

The parallel current is actually an auxiliary variable obtained from Ak through the drift
form of Ampere’s law, Eq. (13) above, with ∇2 replaced by ∇2
⊥.

For the ions we keep the polarisation drift, up, which is required in the current balances
and also in the contributions of the ion pressure to energy conservation. The polarisation
drift is obtained by inserting the lowest order ion velocity, u⊥ + ukb, into the ion inertia
terms (including all components of the stress tensor), and solving anew for the total ion
velocity,

For the electrons we neglect polarisation along with me, so that their total velocity is

u = u⊥ + ukb + up

v = v⊥ + vkb

noting that vk is given in Eq. (18). The polarisation drift is given by

following from the fact that it is primarily proportional to gradients of scalars. In contrast
to the local treatments, the polarisation drift does indeed appear explicitly in the inertia,
but only in the advective derivative. On the other hand, the inertial velocity itself is the
lowest order version, whose perpendicular component is u⊥. Consequently, we construct
the components of Π∗ using only the lowest order velocities, u⊥ + ukb, as we will need to

use the fact that Π∗ : ∇u vanishes, for whichever vector u is used to construct Π∗ (if this is
done in detail it must be extended to include qi∧ in Π∗ to get the gyroviscous cancellation
[13] to work properly when the temperature and density gradients are equally steep [16]).

We note here that everything having to do with ion inertia in the perpendicular force
balance is encompassed within the polarisation drift, including not only the advection of
vorticity but also Reynolds stress and gyroviscosity.

The equations under the drift approximation are formed by substituting the above

expressions for the velocities into the rest of the ﬂuid equations. The evolution of φ is
controlled by the polarisation equation, which is formed by subtracting the densities so as
to form a continuity equation for electric charge. The charge density itself is set to zero,
leaving ∇ · J = 0. Expressing the total current as

J = Jkb + J∗ + Jp

We note that this is an approximate treatment, but as we will now show, it conserves
global energy. We ﬁrst make a few remarks. First, the reason for including up in the
advective derivative u · ∇ is conservation of the inertial energy incorporated in u⊥. We
must manipulate the polarisation equation such that the density is brought under both the
time derivative and under a resulting total divergence. Since it starts out as a multiplier
on ∂/∂t as well as on the advecting velocity, the continuity demands require that we keep
up in niu · ∇ if we keep it in ∇ · niu. This chain of demands starts at the presence of ∇kpe
in the Ohm’s law, continues with ∇kJk in the electron pressure equation and hence the
density equation, and ﬁnally with the fact that the divergences of Jk and up go together
in the continuity. The ordering and conservation are preserved by keeping up in u · ∇, but
not in the actual inertial velocity, u⊥. Second, although the perpendicular and parallel

10

components of vectors are set up diﬀerently, they are kept separate in all computations
so that there is no violation of energy conservation. Finally, one sees that part of the
drift ordering is expressed in the fact that the equations are written only for the lowest
order components of the ion velocity and magnetic ﬁeld, but the operations involving those
velocities and gradients include all components in order to conserve energy.

The energy theorem is formed by multiplying Eqs. (26,30) for the vorticity and parallel
velocity by −φ and uk, and Eq. (28) for the magnetic potential by Jk, respectively. The
pressures in Eqs. (29,31) represent the thermal energy. The total energy density is

We will call these pieces the drift energy, sound wave energy, electron and ion thermal
energy, and magnetic energy, respectively.

The ﬁrst consideration is how polarisation works under the drift approximation. We

multiply the polarisation equation by φ, to obtain

where J includes all three pieces, Jkb + J∗ + Jp. The form of this that we actually use is

φ∇ · J = ∇ · φJ − J · ∇φ = 0

−Jp · ∇φ + ∇ · φJ − J∗ · ∇φ = Jk∇kφ

where the ﬁrst piece will give part of the drift energy, the next two pieces will be combined
into a total ﬂux plus a transfer term, and the piece on the right side is already a transfer
term. We manipulate

aﬀecting J⊥ since vE is also perpendicular to B. This cancellation results in the fact
that the ExB thermal transport eventually appears with a factor of 3/2, so that the ExB
divergence, not an ExB advection, is the process by which transfer with the thermal
reservoir occurs. We will show this in Section V, together with the other characteristics of
ExB transport.

The part of the Poynting ﬂux involving Jk moves parallel to B and is the process by

which the MHD part of shear Alfv´en waves move ﬁeld energy along B:

in which the transport terms are the ones under the divergence operator on the left side,
and the transfer terms are those on the right side. We note that the reason that u must
include all components of the ion velocity is to bring the factor of ni under both the partial
time derivative and the divergence operator simultaneously. In other words, whatever we
keep in the velocity divergence in the density equation must also be kept in the advection
in the polarisation equation, and in all the ion ﬂuid equations as well.

We now ﬁnd where the energy transferred out of this drift energy goes. The next
subtlety is the magnetic energy. We multiply Eq. (28) by Jk and manipulate the divergence
to obtain

The terms on the right side are the adiabatic and Alfv´enic transfer eﬀects and resistive
dissipation, which function the same way as in drift wave turbulence [6]. The divergence

term is the inductive part of the Poynting energy ﬂux, as we can see by evaluating the

where we note that the inductive electric ﬁeld appears with b since the term it is crossed
into is B⊥. The inductive part of the Poynting ﬂux involving B⊥ is in this equation,
transporting magnetic energy, while the static part is in Eq. (43), transporting ExB en-
ergy. Both are small, however, except for the part propagating along B, which carries the
Alfv´en wave energy but whose contribution to transport across magnetic ﬂux surfaces is

nevertheless negligible.

The sound wave energy is found by multiplying Eq. (30) by uk, noting that here also
the need to put the factor of ni under the time derivative and the divergence requires
keeping up in the advection terms. We obtain

The thermal energy comes next. These are simply the pressure equations, with some of

the advection terms evaluated piece by piece. For the electrons we have Eq. (29), in which
the transfer eﬀects with other equations are now obvious: adiabatic transfer (Jk∇kpe) and
resistive frictional heating (JkRei) with the magnetic energy, acoustic coupling (uk∇kpe)
with the sound waves, and the ExB divergence (pe∇ · vE) with the drift energy through
polarisation. For the ions we have Eq. (31), in which the transfer eﬀects are thermal
coupling (uk∇kpi) and viscous heating (the µk term) with the sound waves, and the ExB

The transport eﬀects are written in order of their usual importance; in practical situ-

ations only the terms in the ﬁrst line need be kept.

In situations where transport by

Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter currents (generally caused by nonzero magnetic divergences involving the

equilibrium pressure) is relevant, the second line would have to be kept as a unit, since the

divergences of all the currents go together. The diamagnetic ﬂuxes are combined into the

terms involving the drift operator. The terms in the last line are negligible unless there

are transonic or supersonic ﬂows.

The dominant transport eﬀect across the magnetic ﬂux surfaces is the ExB advection,
(3/2)pevE, which appears with the factor of 3/2 due to the Poynting cancellation, Eq. (42).
The diamagnetic ﬂuxes drop to the second line due to the well known diamagnetic can-

cellation in the pressure equations [17]. For the parallel transport, the principal eﬀects
are the electron and ion heat ﬂuxes, B−1(qek + qik)B⊥. We also have the ion advection,
(5/2B)piukB⊥, appearing with the factor of 5/2 due to the compressibility of the parallel
ﬂows. For the electrons the part of this eﬀect involving Jk is small because Ak is the stream
function for B⊥ and it is also related to Jk through Ampere’s law, but here we also have
the acoustic advective eﬀect, (5/2B)peukB⊥. These parallel advective eﬀects are small,
however, since the sound wave transit time is generally much longer than the time scale of

the turbulence.

To summarise, we have a set of drift equations following the drift ordering as to

magnetic compression but allowing for an arbitrary scale of motion and with it, interactions

with the thermal gradient of the background. The conservation of total energy is exact,

but at the price that the total velocity must be kept in advection. The extra piece, that is,

the polarisation drift, is given in terms of the dependent variables through a constitutive

relation, Eq. (25).

IV. A One Dimensional Mean Field Model of Transport by ExB Turbulence

In this section we construct a mean ﬁeld transport model including both perpendicular

and parallel ﬂows. All dependent variables are split into proﬁle quantities which are ﬂux

functions (dependence only on the ﬂux surface label coordinate), and disturbances which

have arbitrary coordinate dependence but are zero in ensemble average. The proﬁles are

assumed to be slowly varying in time and space compared to the disturbances, so the

ensemble average can be understood as one over an interval of time short compared to the

transport time of a given radial region but long compared to the ﬂuctuation time scale

of the turbulence. The energy content of the disturbances is assumed to be negligible,

so that their energy equations become statements that their net transfer eﬀects are all

content times

in quasistatic balance. Transport of wave energy across ﬂux surfaces (disturbance energy
vE) is kept until the disturbance energy equations are evaluated, in order
to show that it is small. The disturbances form nonvanishing quadratic transport and

transfer quantities in the mean ﬁeld equations; these quantities control the evolution of

e

the proﬁles.

We retain both poloidal and toroidal rotation, fully described by the two state vari-

ables, φ and pi, and the parallel ﬂow uk. In contrast with more usual treatments, we keep
the partial time derivatives in the polarisation equation, and hence also the energy content

of the drift ﬂows. Both ﬂows are aﬀected by Reynolds stress and by neoclassical friction,

the latter acting only on the poloidal component of the total ﬂow (recall that parallel is not

purely toroidal and perpendicular is not purely poloidal). The parallel ﬂow disturbances

are also dissipated by parallel viscosity. We also retain magnetic ﬂux diﬀusion, keeping

resistive dissipation for both proﬁles and disturbances.

The equations for the proﬁles are those derived in Section III, simpliﬁed by the symme-

try assumptions, but with the addition of the ensemble averaged transport eﬀects. For the

disturbances we mainly have to declare what is kept in order to satisfy energy conservation,

since the role of the disturbances is to provide transfer channels.

To proceed with the transfer evaluations we need the density equation. This model

follows transport of electrons, but the ion density is needed for the factors of niMi in front
of the partial time derivatives in the ﬂow equations to conserve energy properly. For the

electrons we have

(52)

We write both these equations to emphasise the fact that neglect of the polarisation com-
pression and the neglect of particle transport by the parallel current in general go together.
vE can be neglected, since the
It is important here to note the assumption that ∇ · ni
vE should vanish in order to have transport not go by direct

The last term is the parallel component of the poloidal friction, with uθ =

unit vector, νd the neoclassical friction coeﬃcient, and u⊥ given by the proﬁles of φ and
pi as in Section III. The third term is the “conductive” parallel momentum transport, as
we can see by using Eq. (52) to form the parallel momentum equation,

The ﬁrst term under the divergence is transport via the anomalous particle ﬂux, and the
second is due to correlations between the parallel ﬂow and ExB disturbances, which is also
the perp-parallel Reynolds stress. The latter term is called the “conductive” part of the
transport. The transport operating through the particle ﬂux is called the “convective”
part. We simply generalise this concept, which is standard for thermal energy, to the
other conserved quantities. The last term transfers momentum with the magnetic ﬁeld;
the momentum of u⊥ is not followed, consistent with the drift approximation in which the
background magnetic ﬁeld is an anchor.

ﬂux is a third order nonlinearity which represents the ExB transport of wave energy in

the turbulence. We carry these terms here for illustration, but since they are down by two

orders of δ they are always small in practice (and are measured to be small in turbulence

computations).

The energy transfer via the Reynolds stress is apparent in Eq. (57), as are the parallel

ﬂow transfer eﬀects we saw in Section III. These four Eqs. (53,54,56,57) together show why

the particle ﬂux has to be kept in advection; otherwise we would have problems with si-

multaneous conservation of energy and momentum. The same is true for the perpendicular

ﬂow, which we treat next.

The perpendicular ﬂow is determined by the scalar ﬁelds φ and pi, and since the ion
pressure has its own equation this one becomes the equation for φ. For the proﬁles we

the vorticity disturbances, as the ExB contributions to the Reynolds stress are dominant.
The ﬁrst term on the right side illustrates ExB shearing but will drop out of the energy
equation due to symmetry. The next term is the conventional nonlinearity and will give
rise to the ExB wave energy transport. The third term is the advection of the ﬂow proﬁle
by ﬂow disturbances, and is the term which conserves energy against the Reynolds stress
in Eq. (58).

The energy equation for the ﬂow proﬁle is constructed as in Section III: we multiply
Eq. (58) by −φ and manipulate the divergences (equivalent to integrations by parts under
an integral), also subtracting (Jp/nee) · ∇pi from both sides, the left side completing the
speciﬁc energy (squared velocity) and the right side providing the polarisation transfer
with the ion pressure. Eq. (52) is used to bring the factors of ni under the partial time

the average transfer and transport (i.e., the mean). Some of the transfer eﬀects cancel
in this fashion, most notably the adiabatic transfer mechanism

The most important result of this model is the set of transfer channels between each
of the pressures and the perpendicular and parallel ﬂows, which are depicted in Fig. 2.
This includes the appearance of anomalous transfer eﬀects between the electron and ion
temperatures, given by Tei as deﬁned in Eq. (79). This anomalous transfer is an essential
result of drift wave physics in the turbulence. The electron thermal gradient drives ExB

uk) channels, which is here represented in terms
of the coupling between the pressures. More generally, whichever species has the larger
temperature contributes more to the drive of the turbulence, relaxing the corresponding
gradient the more eﬃciently. Rather than a monotonic exchange eﬀect as would be man-
dated by dissipative kinetic theory, the anomalous transfer is more a tendency towards
equipartition given a statistical system. All three of the terms which comprise Tei in

Eq. (79) are involved, but

Although this probably depends in detail on the existence of direct dissipation in the ions

these transfer channels exist and that they can be signiﬁcantly stronger that the classical,
collisional transfer usually considered. It is important to note that the drift wave anoma-

The other signiﬁcant transfer eﬀects are those involving the Reynolds stresses. The
one most considered is RE, acting on the perpendicular ﬂow. But in regions where the

23

parallel ﬂow has a large gradient the perp-parallel component RE k also enters.
It is
interesting to note that the direct dissipation in this model due to νd and RE acting on
the diamagnetic ﬂow u∗ is exactly cancelled by part of the polarisation transfer, leaving
only the time dependent and advective vorticity contributions, which constitute a real
compressional eﬀect. This does not reduce the computational complexity however. But
since Eq. (73) says that ∇ · Jp = 0, the polarisation current Jp may itself vanish in an
enclosed domain, allowing the neglect of the work term involving Jp entirely. This only
holds if the gradients of φ and pi are set to zero at the outer boundary, however; if it
is desired to incorporate a loss model at that boundary, then one must keep Jp · ∇pi to
conserve energy. The other unusual eﬀects regarding the polarisation drift velocity are
avoided because of the neglect of parallel transport in a one-dimensional model, but in a
two-dimensional model they would have to be faced (see the comments preceding Eq. 36).

It might be tempting to model RE strictly as ﬂow generation, expecting it to balance
the neoclassical friction in determining the equilibrium state of φ [18]. But in many cases
the only important eﬀect on φ is RE acting alone; there is evidence from experimental
studies of internal transport barriers that in some regimes, especially coinjection of neutral
beams, (the rotation or V-cross-B terms in the force balance are stronger than the pressure
gradient and therefore) the Reynolds stress balances itself to zero in response to strong
ﬂows [19], and computations of drift wave turbulence in the presence of a background ExB
vorticity show that the longer wavelengths are actually driven while the shorter ones are
suppressed, so that very strong ﬂow shear would provide a net drive for the turbulence and
therefore self-deplete [20]. Such a self-regulator mechanism is probably best for modelling
RE. Parallel ﬂow shear is much less well studied, so the question of what to do for RE k
is more open.

Current transport codes neglect the partial time derivative in Eq. (73) and with it the
diﬃculties in treating the polarisation transfer; the frictional damping then (or RE itself)
takes over the determination of φ and the energy in u⊥ is neglected. But in general u⊥ can
be as large as uk, so it is better to keep both ﬂow energies. Actually, most transport codes
neglect the question of plasma rotation entirely, as well as the evolution of the magnetic
ﬂux, which reduces the set of equations to Eqs. (70–72) for ne, pe, and pi, solely with the
particle and energy ﬂuxes, which are easy to model consistently. Even in that case, we do
still have the anomalous transfer terms due to the disturbances, and these could become
interesting in several regions of the plasma.

The existence of anomalous heat transfer has been noted before, in the context of
a quasilinear model for the disturbances [21]. The more general version presented here

24

in the context of mean ﬁeld theory incorporates models based upon linear instabilities as
a subset, but it also allows incorporation of the results from general turbulence studies,
including the strong mode structure changes brought about by the nonlinear dynamics
of the ExB vorticity [7]. The quasilinear model indicates that Tei is only important
where Γ is signiﬁcant; in turbulence however, especially electromagnetic turbulence, the
Jk ensures a prominent role for all three of
robust activity in the dynamics involving ∇k
the contributors to Tei in Eq. (79). Ultimately, further investigation and diagnosis of
generalised turbulence computations will be required to validate any strong conclusions
involving these eﬀects.

V. The Characteristics of Transport Caused by ExB Turbulence

In this section we conﬁrm the main points of Section II concerning the special nature of
ExB turbulent transport, compared with the more familiar random scattering via Coulomb
collisions.

The ﬁrst point is the simplest: the ExB velocity is nearly divergence free,

∇ · vE ≈ 0

(82)

and in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld it is divergence free. For some laboratory conﬁgu-
rations, cylindrical plasma geometry at very low beta bounded by plates at the ends, for
example, this can be taken to be exact. The result is something well known from neu-
tral ﬂuid dynamics:
in a divergence free velocity ﬁeld the pressure does not do work on
the ﬂuid elements. The transfer of energy between the pressure and the velocity becomes
small. For interchange turbulence the work done by the pressure on the ExB velocity
divergence is responsible for the principal forcing eﬀect on the velocity. But for the proﬁles
this is overshadowed by the other transfer eﬀects. A divergence free transporting velocity
is something very diﬀerent from the model in collisional kinetics, by which the velocity is
given by diﬀusion,

nevD = −D(ne, Te)∇ne

(83)

for example. This velocity is only divergence free for speciﬁc dependences of D on the
parameters. For example, the scale of the velocity divergence for a constant diﬀusion is
the same as the scale of the density proﬁle. But vE is exactly or nearly divergence free
according to the magnetic geometry, regardless of what form ne(r) or Te(r) take.

The second point is the Poynting cancellation, Eq. (42). The presence of pvE in the
transport with the factor of 3/2 is true for total energy, but what we want to know is if

25

that is just a result of formal manipulation. We recall that an ideal pressure equation may
be written in terms of a transport term [(5/2)pv] and a work term [v · ∇p], or alternatively
in terms of a transport term [(3/2)pv] and a divergence [p∇ · v].
If the divergence is
small, as we showed for vE, then the second form is more germane. But it is even more
interesting to know how the transport works for each piece of the energy rather than the
total. The quantity (φJ⊥ + pvE) appears in the transport equation for the drift energy,
Eq. 45. In modelling transport terms we usually write down the lowest order forms, which

still conserve energy properly. We know that the diamagnetic current is at the same order
as vE if neeE⊥ is comparable to ∇p, so φJ⊥ is generally the same size as pvE. In fact
they are close enough for the remnant to be negligible. A particularly useful form of the

Poynting cancellation turns out to be the one with the diamagnetic current,

∇ · (φJ∗ + pvE) = ∇ ·

c
B2 B×∇ (φp)

h

i

This is a magnetic divergence, and it is now down to the next smallest row of terms in

Eq. (50) as its scale is that of the magnetic ﬁeld (R in toroidal geometry), and the scale

of interest is Lp. It is therefore a fundamental property of ExB ﬂow dynamics that its
contribution to the total energy transport is

(84)

(85)

Qe + Qi =

p

given that there are no radial equilibrium ﬂows. The physical point of this is that the energy
due to the ﬂuid perpendicular velocities presents a transfer term of the form p∇·vE, rather
than the more usual form vE · ∇p, to the thermal energy reservoir, due to the Poynting
cancellation, so that the actual transport is due to the remaining (3/2)pvE. This role of
the Poynting cancellation is what makes the ExB velocity somewhat “special” compared

e
e

to all the others.

The third point concerns magnetic ﬂux diﬀusion. It is an interesting measured prop-

erty of magnetically conﬁned plasma experiments that the electron thermal transport is

anomalous by more than two orders of magnitude, but the magnetic ﬂux diﬀusion is

neoclassical [22] (classical diﬀusion, modiﬁed by toroidal drifts of particles whose parallel

motion is in the long mean free path regime). If we write the mean ﬁeld Ohm’s law keeping

magnetic ﬂutter, however,

we instantly see why this should be true for ExB turbulence, If the magnetic disturbances

are small or, as is more often the case, uncorrelated, then the anomalous ﬂux diﬀusion is

small; indeed it is zero for purely electrostatic turbulence. It is well known that

contributes negligibly to transport for drift wave turbulence in either slab or toroidal

geometry, due to self consistency eﬀects between

Te [6,23]. Only when the current
gradient is available as an energy source, as for tearing instabilities, [24], do these processes

φ and

lead to appreciable transport. It then follows that the anomalous ﬂux diﬀusion should be

small. With Jk determined by Ak, this holds as well for the current diﬀusion. Anomalous
current diﬀusion can only result from the ExB nonlinearity in the electron inertia, and this

e

e

is small compared to the mechanisms by which currents in a speciﬁcally current carrying

plasma are generated. This is another nice contrast to classical diﬀusion, for in that case
b⊥, the mean

the ﬂux diﬀusivity is much greater than the particle diﬀusivity. Neglecting

With βe ∼ 10−4 in the edge regions of fusion plasmas, this classical diﬀusivity is as large as
the anomalous electron thermal diﬀusivity if not larger. An interesting consequence is that

the MHD equilibrium in this regime is resistive. If the pressure gradient changes during a

transport event it is not the case that the magnetic structure evolves isentropically through

its successive equilibria. This point has been largely ignored in edge transport modelling,

which takes the magnetic structure to be ﬁxed.

The fourth point is the various mechanisms of ExB ﬂow generation. Self consistent

ﬂow generation by turbulence goes through the Reynolds stress [18], a ﬂuid dynamical

mechanism. But for closed, toroidal geometry a sheared ExB velocity proﬁle also means a

radial electric ﬁeld with radial dependence. In other words, a ﬁnite divergence and hence

a ﬁnite charge density. But within low frequency ﬂuid drift motion at scales larger than

the Debye length, the charge density is always small, speciﬁcally, much less than nee, the
charge density of the electrons. Not only that, it is small in all phases of the dynamics,

27

which we can quickly show. Writing simple continuity equations for both ﬂuids using the
velocities in Eqs. (19,20), we ﬁnd a charge continuity equation given by

where ρch = nee − niZe is the charge density. Taking into account that vE · ∇ ∼ ∂/∂t,
the ﬁrst two terms are the same size. But the polarisation current can be written next to
them,

A, since ∇2

The polarisation divergence and the charge density term have the same form, and the
polarisation divergence is larger by a factor of c2/v2
⊥φ = 4πρch. All of the terms
involving ρch are then negligible, and we are left with ∇ · J = 0 as before. This underscores
the strictness of the quasineutral character of the dynamics. It holds pointwise, not just
in an averaged sense. We then conclude that any mechanism which should build up an
electric ﬁeld does so under the ExB ﬂuid dynamics and not due to transport of charges
by currents. The total charge transport itself must vanish. This leads to what happens
as a result of any charged particle source or sink mechanisms. It is quite possible to have
source terms on the right side of Eq. (90), but instead of accumulating charge we then
have a balance between sources and transport,

−∇ · Jp = ∇ ·

Jkb + J∗

+ Se − Si

(91)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

so that the charge content remains small. This is the high throughput regime for electric
charge, similar to the situation with free energy in drift wave turbulence where the current
transfers thermal and drift free energy back and forth but the magnetic energy always
remains small. In the high throughput regime for charges, quasineutrality is maintained
and these source mechanisms act as a torque on the ExB vorticity [12]. Taking charges
out of a ﬂux tube causes the ﬂux tube to rotate, since while the small but ﬁnite ∇2
⊥φ
leads to no appreciable charge density, it the ExB vorticity it does lead to has a signiﬁcant
role. Ultimately, the source of this angular momentum, as in any case for perpendicular
momentum in ﬂuid drift motion, is the background magnetic ﬁeld.

The last point concerns anomalous momentum transport. With the ExB vorticity
proportional to the small but nonzero charge density, transport of angular momentum takes
place through the Reynolds stress, which is nothing more than the nonlinear polarisation
current. But in modelling the transport of this current one should not use an anomalous
conductivity in a simple radial Ohm’s law. Conductivity, or better its inverse, resistivity,

28

(92)

(95)

(96)

is a friction between the two ﬂuids which conserves total momentum. Resistivity leads to
particle diﬀusion, as the magnetic Lorentz force balancing resistive friction,

with perpendicular resistivity η⊥ = meνe/nee2, gives rise to a collisional drift velocity
which acts as a diﬀusion, once the MHD equilibrium constraint, J×B = c∇p, is set in,

The only phenomenon left to transport momentum is the Reynolds stress (cf. Eq. 58),
which is the dominant eﬀect in the momentum ﬂux terms we did not explicitly write in

Eqs. (94,95). The JxB force remains as a transfer mechanism between ﬂuid and Poynting
momentum, with the background magnetic ﬁeld acting as an anchor.

To summarise, transport of the background proﬁle quantities by small scale ExB
turbulence can still be diﬀusive, provided the scale of motion is small compared to Lp.
But its fundamental properties are qualitatively diﬀerent from those of a kinetic diﬀusion
via random thermal motions, and these should be taken into account when constructing

transport models. An example model for one-dimensional transport including ﬂows and
magnetic induction has been given in Section IV. Attempts to extend conventional two-

and three-dimensional edge transport models, which are able to treat the parallel ﬂuxes as
well as the radial transport since the proﬁles are no longer ﬂux functions in their regime,

to incorporate these eﬀects are ongoing [25].

Abstract

The plasma produced by a high-power pulsed circularly polarized microwave ﬁeld which

is much weaker than the atomic ﬁelds is investigated in the non-relativistic limit. It is shown

that the resulting electron distribution function is non-equilibrium and anisotropic. Further-

more, the dispersion equations derived to study and analyze low-frequency ion oscillations.

It is shown an instability may grow in the aforementioned system only when the ion density

exceeds a critical value.

I. INTRODUCTION

A gas discharge in a microwave (MW) ﬁeld is a rather complicated phenomenon that exhibits

a variety of features. Numerous theoretical and experimental studies have been devoted to this

phenomenon.

Interest in such a discharge is related not only to its potential for technological

applications, but also for general understanding of the discharge physics.1,2 A large amount of ex-

perimental data has been accumulated and many theoretical studies have been made to explain its

various details. A number of experiments have been performed with radiation sources operating

at wave lengths of 8.5, 4, 2, and 0.8 cm.3 The strong MW ﬁeld interaction with a gas raises inter-

esting questions about the ionization mechanism and the electron distribution function created by

this ﬁeld. Furthermore, the interaction between high-power microwave ﬁelds with inhomogeneous

plasmas results in a variety of interesting phenomena such as frequency upshift.4

In such a strong microwave wave ﬁeld the electron oscillatory energy ǫe is much higher than

the ionization energy Iioniz of the gas atoms

where ω0 is the radiation frequency, m is the electron mass, and E0 is the electric ﬁeld strength.

When the ﬁeld amplitude is comparable to the atomic ﬁeld strength Ea

tunneling ionization becomes an important mechanism for direct ionization of gas atoms. This

eﬀect has been thoroughly studied in previous papers.5−7 While condition (1) is satisﬁed by a

large margin, relativistic eﬀects are unimportant since the kinetic energy of electron oscillation

in an electromagnetic ﬁeld is comparable to the electron rest mass energy, for present day pulsed

sources. In this case, gas atoms are primarily ionized by the impact of oscillating electrons and

ionization is governed by the development of an electron avalanche. Recently it has been shown

that discharge plasmas produced by super strong pulsed MW ﬁelds are subject to the Weibel

instability associated with the anisotropic nature of the electron distribution function.8

In the present paper, we consider the interaction of circularly polarized MW pulsed ﬁelds with

frequencies ω0

1011 s−1 with a neutral gas in the non-relativistic regime; in

particular we study low frequency ion oscillations and their instabilities. We will consider a pulsed

radiation source which is capable of generating radiation with an intensity of about 108 W cm−2,

whose electric ﬁeld E0

106 V cm−1 is much weaker than the atomic ﬁeld Ea. In this case, we

≤

study the electron distribution function (EDF) and the stability of the discharge plasma in the

aforementioned frequency range at non-relativistic electron oscillation energy ǫe .

This work is organized in ﬁve sections.

In Sec.

II we review the EDF generated by the

interaction of linearly polarized MW ﬁelds with a neutral gas. In Sec. III we consider the eﬀect

of circularly MW ﬁelds on the plasma produced and ﬁnd the general dispersion equation for low

frequency oscillations. In Sec. IV we solve the dispersion equations for low frequencies to ﬁnd an

instability of the system and its growth rate. Finally, a summary and conclusions are presented

in Sec. V.

II. DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION

Under condition (1) the thermal velocity of the electrons in a discharge plasma can be neglected

in comparison to the electron oscillation velocity in the MW radiation ﬁeld. Since the collision

frequency is much smaller than the MW ﬁeld frequency, we can ignore the collisional randomization

of the forced electron oscillation as well. Furthermore, if the plasma density ne(t) produced by

the ﬁeld during gas breakdown is less than the critical density (i.e., ω2

0 > ω2

pe = 4πne2/m) we can

neglect the eﬀect of the polarization ﬁeld. Moreover, the plasma density is assumed to be much

less than the neutral gas density n0 so that the latter can be considered constant. We also suppose

that the ﬁeld was adiabatically switched on in the inﬁnite past. In addition, we can assume that

the MW radiation electric ﬁeld E0 is constant during a single ﬁeld period. Therefore, by assuming

that the electric ﬁeld depends only on time, the kinetic equation for the plasma electrons produced

2

in the gas breakdown by a strong pulsed ﬁeld can be written as follows8

∂f0
∂t

∂f0
∂p

·

+ eE0

= n0ωionizδ(p),

in the non-relativistic limit. Here δ(p) is the Dirac delta function, ωioniz is the ionization probabil-

ity of the gas atoms, and n0 is the neutral gas number density. In the case of MW gas breakdown,

electron-impact ionization is governed by the ionization probability ωioniz. From Eq. (2) the
avalanche ionization parameter γ(E0) can be determined .7−9 We can neglect the right-hand side

of Eq. (2) in the ﬁrst approximation and calculate the EDF directly by solving the Vlasov equation

under the following condition,7−10

ω0

≫

γ(E0), ωioniz.

Condition (3) depends strongly on the neutral gas density and is well satisﬁed at gas pressures

of p0

10

100 Torr. In this approximation, to calculate the electron energy distribution function,

≃

−

we assume the ﬁeld components with circular polarization to be

Ex = E0 sin ω0t,

Ey = E0 cos ω0t,

Ez = 0,

(4)

where the electric ﬁeld amplitude E0 describes a slowly varying (over the ﬁeld period) MW pulsed

envelope.

Considering condition (3) and solving Eq. (2), by averaging the distribution function over the

MW ﬁeld period, we ﬁnd the following expression for the EDF8

where, f0(v, t) = ne(t) ˜f0(v) and vE = eE0/mω0 is the electron oscillatory velocity in an alter-

nating electric ﬁeld; vz is the perpendicular component of electron velocity with respect to the

electric ﬁeld; v⊥ is the component of velocity in the plane of the electric ﬁeld; ˜f0(v) satisﬁes the

(2)

(5)

normalization condition

dv ˜f0(v) = 1.

Since a pulse of a strong MW ﬁeld actually contains on the order of 10-100 wave periods the

EDF is in principle unsteady. However, as one would naturally expect the form of the EDF is

determined after several ionizating collisions. Thereafter the electron concentration exponentially

increases in time while the shape of the EDF does not change.

It is obvious that just on the

initial moment of the gas breakdown the EDF is not in equilibrium. But after several periods

an EDF is produced such that it usually characterizes the breakdown independent from initial

conditions. Furthermore, the growth rate of the plasma density is expressed by

γ/ω0. Thus,

∼

under the gas low-pressure condition (3) the velocity distribution function of electrons is formed

within the ﬁeld period and is not practically changed furthermore. In addition, during instability

development interested in the present paper the plasma density can be considered constant. The

rate of collective eﬀects grows with the increase of the plasma particles concentration, and this is

why the growth rates of plasma instabilities, usually small compared to the plasma frequency, are

proportional to the plasma frequency.

Under conditions (1) and (3) the EDF is well described by Eq. (5) since, at the instant of

originating, the electrons are evenly distributed in phase with the wave electric ﬁeld.

III. DISPERSION EQUATION

The theory of the interaction of MW ﬁelds with a plasma has been widely developed and covers

an increasing range of plasma phenomena.11 In Sec. II the distribution function of the charged

particles for a homogeneous plasma produced by an external circularly polarized MW electric ﬁeld

deﬁned by Eq. (4) was obtained. The stability of such a plasma can be analyzed by considering

small perturbations of this distribution. To begin with, we analyze MW ﬁelds with frequencies

higher than all characteristic plasma frequencies

ω0

ωpα, να ,

≫

(6)

where ωpα, να are the plasma frequency, and collision frequency for α species (ions or electrons),

respectively. To ﬁrst-order approximation, the plasma in a MW ﬁeld may be regarded as isotropic.

Consequently, the ﬁeld E0(t) obeys the dispersion equation for transverse wave

where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Therefore, the MW ﬁeld can be considered homogeneous

for processes with a characteristic length of inhomogeneity k−1 (where k−1 is much smaller than

k−1
0 , or k

≫

ω0/c). Assuming this condition, we analyze quasi-longitudinal oscillations in the

stability of the MW-ﬁeld-produced plasma. In reality, the oscillation frequencies are of the order

of characteristic plasma frequencies, i.e., ω

ωpe. Taking into account relation (7), we ﬁnd the

∼

validity condition of the quasi-longitudinal approximation to be ω

The MW electric ﬁeld with circular polarization primarily interacts with the neutral gas and

produces a plasma whose EDF and properties were summarized in Sec. II. Since we will study

instabilities whose growth rates are higher than the ionization rate we can assume a constant

electron density. It is clear that, for relatively weak ﬁelds in real plasmas, electrons are accelerated

to velocities signiﬁcantly exceeding their thermal velocity during the period of oscillatory electric

ﬁeld and the mean free time. The result is a state in which electrons are moving with respect

to motionless ions. Such a charged particle beam is unstable and its growth increment is rather

large, of the order of the plasma ion frequency or even larger. In this section we derive the general

dispersion relation for the MW produced plasma in the limit of low-frequency ion oscillation

perturbations. Since the eﬀect of a high frequency electric ﬁeld on the plasma ions can be neglected

compared to its eﬀect on the electrons, the ion velocity distribution function can be regarded as

isotropic (usually Maxwellian) and the EDF is given by Eq. (5).

Linearizing the Vlasov equations for electrons and ions in a collisionless plasma we obtain the

The existence of solutions to this inﬁnite set of coupled equations gives the dispersion equation

for small-amplitude longitudinal oscillations in the external MW electric ﬁeld. Since it is a deter-

minant of inﬁnite order, it is impossible to analyze in general. However, for the most interesting

limiting cases this determinant can be simpliﬁed and the oscillation spectrum can be found. For

example, all the values δεe,i(ω + nω0, k) with n

= 0, are small compared to unity in the very

high frequency limit, when condition (6) is satisﬁed. Assuming this limit, only ue00 and ui00 are

nonzero in Eq. (16); thus, we obtain

[1 + δεe(ω, k)] ue00 + δεe(ω, k)J0(kxrE) J0(kyrE) ui00 = 0,

(17)

J0(kxrE) J0(kyrE) δεi(ω, k)ue00 + [1 + δεi(ω, k)] ui00 = 0,

which gives the following dispersion equation

By deriving Eq. (18), we fully neglected particle collisions. However, this equation is also valid

for collisional plasmas if the oscillation velocity component of the particles is small compared to

the thermal velocity. The external MW ﬁeld has no eﬀect on the collision process, i.e., on the

scattering cross sections.

corresponding to unstable low frequency ion oscillations. Here, the following approximation

was used. Equation (21) show that in the case of a circularly polarized MW ﬁeld the low frequency

oscillation takes place only for perturbations satisfying the following condition:

This instability resulting from the positive slope of the distribution function (5) can be interpreted

as the stimulated Cherenkov excitation of the low frequency ion oscillations by the radiation ﬁeld

of the oscillating electrons. Perturbations that do not satisfy the condition (23) are not unstable.

Of course, according to approximations and assumption used, the instability satisfying condition

(23) can only occur when the growth rate exceeds the ionization rate, i.e., the growth rate should

exceed the avalanche ionization constant γ(E0).

V. CONCLUSION

In analyzing the interaction of a high frequency circularly polarized MW ﬁeld with a neutral

gas, we obtained the general dispersion relation for low frequency waves in the MW produced

plasma. From Eq. (23) for the instability condition it is necessary that the the ion density exceeds

the critical value ni

0. Under such condition the electrons transfer electric

≥

ﬁeld energy to the ions and stimulated Cherenkov excitation of low frequency ion oscillations

takes place. This eﬀect requires a positive slope in the distribution function and, in this case, the

instability can propagate when the grow rate exceeds the avalanche ionization rate γ(E0). Other

work underway, is concerned with the case of linearly polarizd MW ﬁelds.

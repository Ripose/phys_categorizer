Abstract. Propagation and absorption of electromagnetic waves with electron
cyclotron resonance (ECR) frequency are experimentally and theoretically investigated
for the case of inhomogeneously magnetized plasma column with peripheral vacuum
layer, when a left-hand polarized wave (LHPW) is selectively launched. The
polarization reversal from the LHPW to the right-hand polarized wave is found to
occur near the ECR point. As a result, it is clariﬁed that the LHPW, which has been
considered not to be absorbed at the ECR point, is absorbed near the ECR point. The
phenomena can be explained by taking into account the eﬀects of the radial boundary
conditions. In addition, it is found that the polarization reversal point can be adjusted
by the external parameters, for example, plasma radius.

1. Introduction

Electron cyclotron wave is important plasma waves in the ﬁelds of basic plasma
physics, nuclear fusion, and plasma processing.
In recent years, suppression of
neoclassical tearing modes and current drive in tokamak are inﬂuentially attempted
by using electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) in the ﬁeld of nuclear fusion [1], where the
localized electron heating plays important roles in. The localized electron cyclotron
resonance heating is hoped to be the most eﬀective method for the formation of

processing, on the other hand, productions of ECR plasma with large diameter, high-
density, and uniformity were reported [4]. ECR has attractive characteristics and many
applications as mentioned above. Although only a right-hand polarized wave (RHPW)
has been considered to be absorbed near the ECR point, the recent experimental
results demonstrated that a left-hand polarized wave (LHPW) was also eﬃciently and
locally absorbed [4-6]. We have suggested the polarization reversal from the LHPW to
the RHPW as an origin of the unexpected absorption of the LHPW[6], and recently
succeeded in observation of the polarization reversal[7]. The detailed mechanisms of
the polarization reversal is worth clarifying in the terms of basic plasma physics and
localized electron heating.

Based on these background, the purposes of the present work are to clarify the

polarization-reversal mechanisms and characteristics.

2. Experimental Setup

Experiments are performed in the QT-Upgrade Machine of Tohoku University as
shown in Fig. 1(a). A coaxial bounded plasma with peripheral vacuum layer is produced
by a direct current discharge in low pressure argon gas (90 mPa). The plasma column
is terminated on the glass endplate located on the opposite side of the plasma source.
The formation of clear boundary between the plasma and the vacuum layer is realized
by using limiter, which is located on the front of tungsten mesh anode and also can
control the plasma radius rp in the range of 2.5 − 4 cm. The typical electron density
and temperature at the radial center of the plasma column are ne ≃ 9 × 1010 cm−3
and Te = 3 eV. Static magnetic-ﬁeld B conﬁguration is inhomogeneous as presented in
Fig. 1(b). The LHPW (6 GHz, 150 mW) is selectively launched in the high magnetic-
ﬁeld region by a helical antenna (z = 0 cm), where the ECR point (B = 2.14 kG)
is z = 78 cm. The wave patterns are obtained with an interference method through
movable dipole antennas, which can receive the each components of wave electric ﬁeld,
i.e., Ex, Ey, and Ez, respectively. Moreover, spatial proﬁles of the wave power Px, Py,
and Pz are measured with a power meter.

3. Experimental and Theoretical Results

Figure 2(a) shows the interferometric wave patterns of Ex (dashed line) and Ey
(solid line) at the radial center of the plasma column, where the ECR point is indicated
by arrow. The wave patterns also demonstrate the unexpected absorption of the LHPW
near the ECR point as reported in previous paper [6]. The long (LW) and short (SW)
wavelength components, which are decomposed from the observed wave patterns in
Fig. 2(a) using Fourier analysis, are presented in Fig. 2(b). The wave patterns of Ex in
the LW and the SW are shifted to the left and to the right of the wave patterns Ey,

respectively. From these phase diﬀerences between Ex and Ey, the LW and SW are
identiﬁed as the LHPW and the RHPW, respectively. In addition, it is noticed that
the LHPW damps and the RHPW grows around z = 60 cm; namely, the polarization
reversal from the LHPW to the RHPW is experimentally evidenced near the ECR point.
As a result of the polarization reversal, the launched LHPW is found to be absorbed
near the ECR point.

We apply the dispersion relation of electromagnetic wave in bounded plasmas, which
includes the eﬀects of the radial boundary condition, in order to explain the polarization
reversal and to evaluate the observed wave patterns. The dispersion equation is derived
by using the Maxwell equations as [8]

where ωpj, ωcj, and ǫj are the plasma frequency, the cyclotron frequency, and the sign of
the charge for species j. In addition, the dispersion relation described by Eq. (1) derive
a polarization index S as

S ≡

|Er + iEθ|
|Er − iEθ|

.

Here, 0 < S < 1 and 1 < S < ∞ represent right-handed and left-handed polarizations,
and S = 0, S = 1, and S = ∞ correspond to circularly right-handed, linear, and
circularly left-handed polarizations. The wave frequency ω/2π is constant and the static
magnetic-ﬁeld strength B is varied when we consider the spatial wave propagation in
z-direction. Therefore, not wave frequency ω/2π but the magnetic-ﬁeld strength B has
to be regarded as a variable in calculating the dispersion relation given by Eq. (1) for
inhomogeneous magnetic-ﬁeld conﬁguration.

The calculated dispersion curve (kk vs. B) is presented in Fig. 3(a) as a solid
line together with the experimentally obtained dispersion relation of the LHPW (closed
square) and the RHPW (open square), where the dashed lines in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)
denote the magnetic-ﬁeld strength at the ECR point. The experimentally obtained
dispersion relation of the LHPW and the RHPW have a good agreement with the
calculated one. Thus, it is found that the wave propagation can be well described by
including the eﬀect of the radial boundary condition. The calculated polarization index
S as a function of magnetic-ﬁeld strength B is plotted in Fig. 3(b), which corresponds to
the dispersion curve in Fig. 3(a). When the wave propagates from high magnetic-ﬁeld
region to the ECR point, it is found that the value of S turns from S > 1 into S < 1,
namely, the wave polarization is varied from left-handed to right-handed. Therefore,
the observed polarization reversal can be also explained by including the eﬀect of the
radial boundary.

We carry out a detailed investigation about the eﬀects of the radial boundary on the
wave propagation and polarization reversal, where the plasma radius is changed in the
range of rp = 2.5 − 4 cm. The absorption of the LHPW and the polarization reversal are
observed for any plasma radius. It is found that the polarization reversal point, where

the RHPW components has a maximum amplitude, is shifted with changing the plasma
radius. Figure 4(a) shows the experimentally observed magnetic-ﬁeld strength Bpr at
the polarization reversal point as a function of the plasma radius rp. The polarization
reversal point is found to move to high magnetic-ﬁeld region with an increase in rp.
This phenomenon is found to be also explained by the dispersion relation in bounded
plasmas. Figure 4(b) shows the calculated polarization indexes (B vs. S) for rp = 2.5,
3, and 4 cm, where the arrows indicate the magnetic-ﬁeld strength at the polarization
reversal point (S = 1). The magnetic-ﬁeld at the polarization reversal point is found
to become higher with an increase in rp, which is consistent with the experimentally
observed phenomenon as shown in Fig. 4. These results implies that the polarization
reversal point could be controlled by adjusting the plasma radius, which yields the
control of the wave-absorption region near the ECR point.

4. Conclusion

The propagation and absorption of the electromagnetic wave near the ECR point are
investigated for the case of inhomogeneously magnetized plasma, when the left-hand
polarized wave (LHPW) is selectively launched by using the helical antenna. Our
experimental results demonstrate the polarization reversal from the LHPW to the
right-hand polarized wave (RHPW) and the resultant absorption of the LHPW. The
polarization reversal can be well explained by the dispersion relation including the eﬀect
of the radial boundary. In addition, it is found that the polarization reversal point is
shifted by the plasma radius. This phenomenon can be interpreted in the term of the
dispersion relation in bounded plasmas. Here, the possibility of the polarization reversal
point is implied, which could play important role in the control of the wave absorption
region near the ECR point.

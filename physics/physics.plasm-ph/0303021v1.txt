Three-dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) electron solitary wave solutions are con-
structed for magnetized plasmas in which electrons are exactly magnetic ﬁeld-aligned. The form of
the solitary potential is not tightly constrained. If one takes a Gaussian form, the relation between
the solitary potential amplitude and its parallel and perpendicular widths is constrained by an in-
equality. The inequality width-amplitude relation allows us to distinguish, based on macroscopic
observables, the BGK solitary waves from other solitons such as Korteweg-de Vries solitons whose
widths and amplitudes are of a one-one mapping relation. The inequality relation allows BGK
solitary waves to be excited easily, since for a ﬁxed amplitude there exists a wide range of admitted
widths. When ﬁnite cyclotron radius eﬀect is taken into account, the properties obtained for the
case of zero cyclotron radius are found to be still applicable under the condition that the electron
cyclotron radius is much less than the distance over which the structure of the solitary wave varies.

Long-lived coherent structures with nonuniform charge
densities are ubiquitous in collisionless plasma systems.
Laboratory experiments have shown that systems can be
driven into states with such structures by applying volt-
ages [1, 2], currents [3], waves [4], or beam injections
[5].
In one dimension, general solutions of the time-
stationary nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson equations that gov-
ern the electrostatic degree of freedom in collisionless
plasma were ﬁrst obtained by Bernstein, Greene, and
Kruskal (BGK) [6]. These equations are nonlinear be-
cause the electrostatic potential is a function of particle
distributions and that in turn determines how plasma
particles distribute themselves. Nonuniform charge den-
sities are sustained by this nonlinearity through the eﬀect
of particle trapping in the electrostatic potentials. In the
linear regime where the deviation δf from the equilibrium

distribution f0 is small, δf /f0
), perturbed states with nonuniform

charge densities would undergo Landau damping, and
eventually relax to uniform states [7]. The BGK states,
on the other hand, are nonlinear structures that are free
from Landau damping.

We are interested in BGK waves that are fully localized
in three dimensional space for magnetized plasma sys-
tems, and in the unique kinetic properties of these local-
ized waves. Laboratory [1] and computer [8] experiments
have shown that three dimensional BGK solitary waves
are dynamically accessible from unstable initial condi-
tions. Recent observations in collisionless space plasmas
have also revealed the frequent appearance of electro-
static solitary structures that are fully localized [9, 10].
In this letter, we will ﬁrst construct azimuthally symmet-
ric solutions for the case of inﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld, derive
the inequality width-amplitude relation, and discuss the
uniqueness of having widths and amplitudes constrained
by an inequality. We will then tune down the magnetic
ﬁeld to ﬁnite values and ﬁnd conditions under which the

BGK solitary structures can be described by the solu-
tions we constructed. We deal only with electron soli-
tary waves in this paper, but similar calculations can be
analogously applied to ion solitary waves.

To construct exact nonlinear solutions that are local-
ized in three spatial dimensions, we use the BGK ap-
proach that was formulated for 1D nonlinear Vlasov-
Poisson equations [6], and extend the Poisson equation
to 3D. The electron solitary waves take the form of a po-
tential hump. Electrons with total energy less than zero
are trapped inside the potential energy trough, and are
called trapped electrons. Electrons with positive energies
are called passing electrons. Ions will be taken as uniform
background, an approximation valid when the thermal
energy of ions is much greater than that of electrons,
or when the solitary waves move with respect to ions
in a speed much larger than the ion thermal speed. We
will prescribe the potential form and the passing electron
distribution, solve for the trapped electron distribution,
and derive the physical parameter range. It is much eas-
ier to do this than to prescribe the passing and trapped
electron distributions to solve for the potential [11], so
we can explore the allowed solitary wave solutions much
more fully.

Using cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) with the sym-
metry axis ˆz deﬁned to be along the direction of the
background magnetic ﬁeld, the dimensionless 3D Pois-
son equation with azimuthal symmetry takes the form

with respect to the ambient electron frame, the ratio of
the solitary wave speed to the thermal speed (called the
Mach number) cannot be transformed away even in the
wave frame, and will come in through the passing electron
distribution. This point will be further illustrated when
we get to the passing electron distribution.

Eq. (2) stipulates that for any r, there exists a 1D
Vlasov equation in the parallel direction. These paral-
lel Vlasov equations for diﬀerent r are not independent,
instead, their mutual relation in the perpendicular direc-
tion is determined by the perpendicular proﬁle of Φ, due
to the fact that Φ is the potential produced collectively
by the plasma particles. Once Φ is known, the Pois-
son equation determines the electron density ρ(r, z), the
passing electron distribution fp(w) is determined by the
Boltzmann distribution, and a trapped electron distribu-
tion ftr(w) can be found to make up the total density,
where w = v2
Φ(r, z) is the electron energy. The impor-
tant requirement for self-consistency is that the trapped
electron distribution ftr(w) so determined should be non-
negative. This procedure gives

we restrict to cases when solitary waves do not move in
the ambient electron frame (zero Mach number). The
ﬁnite Mach number cases will be treated elsewhere, but
the main feature, namely that the width-amplitude rela-
tion is an inequality, we aim to address in this letter is
independent of the Mach number.

With the potential and passing electron distribution
given by Eqs. (4) and (5), the trapped electron distribu-
tion can be obtained from Eq. (3) as

φ(r, z) < 0. Diﬀerent perpendicular, par-
allel widths and potential amplitudes give diﬀerent con-
stants and coeﬃcients to ftr(w) and thus yield diﬀerent
ftr values. Some combinations of (ψ, δr, δz) can give neg-
ative ftr values and this means that there does not exist
an electron distribution to support the potentials with
these (ψ, δr, δz) parameters. To further illustrate how
the tuning of the parameters aﬀects the trapped electron
distribution, the trapped and passing electron distribu-
tions ftr (thick lines) and fp (thin lines) are plotted at
r = 0 and z = 0 as a function of velocity v in Figure
1. The parameters (ψ, δr, δz) = (1.45, 5, 3) correspond to
a BGK solitary wave that has zero phase space density
at its phase space center (r = 0, z = 0, v = 0) as shown
by the solid curves in Figures 1 (a) and (b). When the
size of the structure is ﬁxed, decreasing the amplitude
raises the center phase space density as shown by the
dashed curve for ψ = 0.5 in 1(a). On the other hand,
increasing the amplitude would lower the center phase
space density from zero to a negative value (not shown),
and hence would result in unphysical solutions. When
the amplitude is ﬁxed, increasing the parallel size raises
the center phase space density as shown in 1(b) by the
dashed curve for δz = 10. Varying δr results in a simi-
lar eﬀect. The above examples also illustrate that when
one prescribes a particular class of electron distributions
with nonzero center phase space densities to solve for the
potential, as Schamel did [11], one restricts to a small
subset of the solution space. The width-amplitude rela-
tion obtained in [11] shows that the width decreases with
increasing amplitude. This property was derived based
on the solution subset, and is the property of that subset
(depending on the location and shape of the subset in
the entire solution space), not intrinsic to BGK solitary
waves.

We now proceed to derive the width-amplitude in-
equality relation. For a given w < 0, the maximum r
at which a trapped electron with energy
w can exist
w = Φ(rmax, 0).

ity (10) stems from the fact that the overall proﬁle of

ftr(w) is free to be shifted by an arbitrary positive num-
ber while maintaining it nonnegative.
In other words,
we have the freedom to adjust the occupation number

fests itself as the allowed continuum of widths and am-
plitudes on and above the shaded surface in Figure 2. A

tron distribution has been provided in Figure 1 with the

plitude or increasing the size shifts a point on the surface
to the region above, and Figures 1(a) and (b) illustrate
respectively the eﬀects on the distribution functions.

In the limit of δr

, the trapped electron distri-
bution given by Eq. (8) reduces to the one-dimensional
trapped electron distribution for a Gaussian potential
and a Boltzmann passing electron distribution [13]. In
this limit, the inequality width-amplitude relation is sim-
ply inequality (10) with δr set as
. The 1D inequality
relation provides us a ground to understand the discrep-
ancy between the width-amplitude relations obtained by
Turikov [14] and Schamel [11]. Turikov [14] studied only
empty-centered electron holes and concluded that the po-
tential width increases with the amplitude (correspond
to points on the shaded surface in the limit δr
),
while Schamel [11] prescribed a class of trapped electron
distributions whose center phase space densities always
take positive values, and concluded that for small ampli-
tude electron holes the width decreases with the ampli-
tude. Schamel’s conclusion was drawn from the obser-

→ ∞

vation that for smaller and smaller potential amplitudes,
his β parameter picks up distributions with larger and
larger center phase space densities, and therefore poten-
tial widths. These correspond to points in Figure 2 far-
ther and farther above the shaded surface. The reader is
referred to [15] for a more detailed discussion.

We now derive the condition under which the above
properties can be carried over to the cases with ﬁnite
magnetic ﬁeld. We use the method based on studying
the equations of motion of electrons in a uniform mag-
netic ﬁeld by using the coordinates X, Y of the instanta-
neous center of the cyclotron orbit, and the components
Vx, Vy of the velocity of the electron [16]. The motion
of an electron inside the solitary structure, if we follow
the electron, is inﬂuenced by the uniform B and the 3D
inhomogeneous E(x, y, z), where z is the coordinate par-
allel to B. We want to know whether the eﬀect of ﬁnite
cyclotron radius would result in decoherence of the soli-
tary structure, that is, how the distance of the guiding
center to the symmetry axis would vary. Hence it is best
to look at the electron motion on a 2D plane that is per-
pendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and onto which the 3D
electron trajectory is projected.
In the absence of the
electric ﬁeld, the solution of the equation of motion is

where ω = eB/m, R and α are polar coordinates of the
gyro-center, V /ω the radius of the cyclotron orbit, φ the
gyro-phase angle, and R, α, V , φ are constants. In the
presence of the electric ﬁeld (which shall be expressed as
an electrostatic potential U (~r, t), where the t-dependence
is introduced by the z-dependence of E(x, y, z)), the vari-
ables are no longer constants but vary with time. The

We therefore conclude that when the time variation scale
of U is much smaller than the cyclotron frequency ω, and
the spatial variation scale (rU ) of U is much smaller than
the cyclotron radius rc, the instantaneous guiding center
would spiral around the zeroth order guiding center, and
the solitary structure can be maintained. Since the time
variation of U is characterized by the frequency of the
electron bouncing in the parallel direction, the condition
can be written as

where we have expressed on the right hand side of the
arrows the condition in terms of familiar variables. For
a ﬁxed potential amplitude ψ, the decrease in the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength can be compensated by increases in
δr and δz to keep the above two conditions satisﬁed. This
would not be possible, had the width-amplitude relation
been an equality. In other words, having the widths and
amplitudes constrained by an inequality is essential for
BGK solitary waves to exist with reasonable amplitudes
in weak magnetic ﬁeld regions such as the part of the
magnetosphere that is farther away from the Earth. This
result provides a basis to understand the fact that electro-
static solitary waves observed in the high latitude iono-
sphere where the magnetic ﬁeld is weaker have larger size
than those observed in the low latitude ionosphere [17].

The inequality width-amplitude relation distinguishes,
based on macroscopic observables, BGK solitary waves
from other solitons such as Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) soli-
tons [18] whose width-amplitude relation is of one-one
mapping. The size and the amplitude of BGK solitary
waves do not have a lower cut-oﬀ within our theory. The
size can be well below the Debye radius as far as there
are enough electrons in the solitary wave to ensure the
validity of the mean-ﬁeld approach. Taking a Debye ra-
dius (λD) 100 m and a plasma density 5 cm−3 (typical
of the low altitude auroral ionosphere), a width of 0.01
106 electrons in
λD for the solitary potential allows 5
the structure, and hence is still well within the function-
ing range of the mean-ﬁeld approach. Indeed, subDebye
scale solitary waves have been observed [10].

×

In summary, we have constructed azimuthally symmet-
ric BGK electron solitary wave solutions when electrons
only travel along the magnetic ﬁeld, derived the inequal-
ity width-amplitude relation, and obtained the condition
under which the results for zero cyclotron radius are ap-
plicable to the cases with ﬁnite cyclotron radius. The
facts that the potential forms are not tightly constrained
and that the width-amplitude relation is an inequality
provide a multitude of freedom for the BGK solitary
structures to exist, and make BGK solitary waves eas-
ily accessible in systems with suﬃciently high ﬂuctua-
tion levels. From this point of view, it is not surprising
that BGK waves are ubiquitous in driven and turbulent
plasma systems where collisional eﬀect is negligible. A
high probability of excitations of the BGK solitary waves
is expected to alter the bulk properties of the plasma
medium such as the dc resistivity.

The semiclassical dynamics of a charged particle moving in a two-component plasma is consid-
ered using a corrected Kelbg pseudopotential. We employ the classical Nevanlinna-type theory of
frequency moments to determine the velocity and force autocorrelation functions. The constructed
expressions preserve the exact short and long-time behavior of the autocorrelators. The short-time
behavior is characterized by two parameters which are expressable through the plasma static correla-
tion functions. The long-time behavior is determined by the self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The theoretical
predictions are compared with the results of semiclassical molecular dynamics simulation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this paper is the investigation of the dynamics of force on a charged particle in a two component
plasma. Boercker et al. have shown the eﬀect of ion motion on the spectral line broadening by the surrounding
plasma [1,2]. In recent papers it was argued that the microﬁeld dynamics inﬂuence the fusion rates [3] and rates for
three-body electron-ion recombination [4] in dense plasmas. Generally speaking, to calculate the plasma eﬀect on
rates and spectral line broadening one needs a theory of average forces and microﬁelds, including the resolution in
space and time. Basic results in this ﬁeld were obtained by Silin and Rukhadze [5], Klimontovitch [6], Alastuey et.
al. [7], and Berkovsky et. al. [8].

The determination of the static distribution of the ion or electron component of the electric microﬁeld is a well
studied problem (for a review see [9]). The corresponding investigations are performed on the basis of the one-
component plasma (OCP) model. A straightforward generalization of the OCP model is the model of a two-component
plasma (TCP), consisting of electrons and ions. In a recent paper [10] the probability distribution for the electric
microﬁeld at a charged point has been studied. It was shown that the two-component plasma microﬁeld distribution
shows a larger probability of high microﬁeld values than the corresponding distribution of the OCP model.

The dynamics of the electric microﬁeld is a less understood problem than that of the static microﬁeld distribution
even for the case of an OCP. Recently some progress has been made for both the case of electric ﬁeld dynamics at a
neutral point [7,11,12] and the dynamics of force on a charged impurity ion in an OCP [8].

This paper is aimed to extend the studies of electric microﬁeld dynamics in OCP to the case of an equilibrium two
component plasma. For simplicity we consider a two-component plasma which is anti-symmetrical with respect to
the charges (e− =
e+) and therefore symmetrical with respect to the densities (ni = ne). To simplify the numeric
investigations we simulated a mass symmetric (nonrelativistic) electron-positron plasma with m = mi = me. The
theoretical investigations are carried out for arbitrary electron-ion mass ratios.

In this paper we will study the dependence of the force dynamics on the coupling constant Γ = e2/kBT a of the
plasma, where T is the temperature, and a = (3/4πne)1/3 is the average distance between the electrons. Coupled
plasmas with a plasma parameter of the order or greater than unity are important objects in nature, laboratory
experiments, and in technology [13–16]. Recent lasers allow to create a coupled plasma within femtoseconds [17].
Laser generated plasmas are nonequlibrium plasmas with an initial electron temperature much higher than the ion
temperature. However, in this paper we restrict our considerations to the model object of an equilibrium two-
component plasma (TCP).

Several investigations were devoted to the simulation of equilibrium two-component plasmas Being interested in
quasi-classical methods we mention explicitely the quasi-classical simulations of two-component plasmas performed
by Norman and by Hansen [18,19].

In this paper the free charges (electron and ions) are simulated by a semi-classical dynamics based on eﬀective
potentials. The idea of the semi-classical method is to incorporate quantum-mechanical eﬀects (in particular the
Heisenberg and the Pauli principle) by appropriate potentials. This method was pioneered by Kelbg, Deutsch and
others [20,21]. Certainly, such a quasi-classical approach has several limits. For the calculation of a standard macro-
scopic property as the microﬁeld dynamics which has a well deﬁned classical limit the semi-classical approach may be
very useful. The advantage of such an approach is the relative simplicity of the algorithm.

II. THE SLATER SUM AND THE SEMICLASSICAL MODEL

A familiar derivation of eﬀective potentials describing quantum eﬀects is based on the Slater sums which are deﬁned

by the N - particle wave functions,

S(r1, . . . , rN ) = const

where En and Ψn are the energy levels and corresponding wave functions of the ensemble of N particles with coor-
dinates r1, . . . , rN . Here we consider a two-component plasma consisting of Ne electrons with mass me and Ni = Ne
ions with mass mi. The properties of the Slater sums for Coulombic systems were studied in detail by several authors
[13,22]. Choosing the eﬀective potential

we may calculate the correct thermodynamic functions of the original quantum system [13,22,18] from the thermody-
namic functions of a classical reference system.

The Slater sum may be considered as an analogue of the classical Boltzmann factor. Therefore it is straightforward to
use the Slater sum for the deﬁnition of an eﬀective potential. The only modiﬁcation in comparison with classical theory
is the appearance of many-particle interactions. If the system is not to dense (i.e., neΛ3
1, Λe = ¯h/√2mekBT ) one
may neglect the contributions of higher order many-particle interactions. In this case one writes approximately,

Here Ψα and Eα denote the wave functions and energy levels of the pair ab, respectively. The prime at the
summation sign indicates that the contribution of the bound states (which is not be considered here) has to be
omitted.

Principal it is possible to calculate the Slater sum for a pair of particles directly from the known two-particle
Coulomb wavefunctions. To simplify the simulations it is better to have an analytic expression for the potential. A
possible candidate is the so called Kelbg potential obtained by a perturbational expansion It reads [20]

Another analytic approximation for the exact two-particle eﬀective potential is the expression derived by Deutsch
which was used in the simulations by Hansen and McDonald [19].

The Kelbg potential is a good approximation for the two-particle Slater sum in the case of small parameters
(eaeb)/(kBT λab) if the interparticle distance r is suﬃciently large. However, at small interparticle distances
ln(Sab(r = 0)). In order to describe the right behavior also at

ξab =
it shows a deviation from the exact value of
small distances it is better to use a corrected Kelbg potential deﬁned by [24]

We mention that in the region of high temperatures

the Kelbg potential (Aab = 0) almost coincide with the corrected Kelbg potential Eq. (7). In the region of intermediate
temperatures 0.1 < Tr < 0.3 the Kelbg potential does not give a correct description of the two-particle Slater sum
at short distances. Instead we may use the corrected Kelbg-potential Eq.(7) to get an appropriate approximation for
the Slater sum at arbitrary distances.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

The eﬀective potentials derived from perturbation theory do not include bound state eﬀects. The other limiting
case of large ξab or small temperature Tr < 0.1, where bound states are of importance, can be treated by another
approach [22]. Here a transition to the chemical picture is made, i.e. bound and free states have to be separated.

In the present work we are interested in the regime of intermediate temperatures. In this regime the simulations of

the dynamics may be performed with the potential Eq.(7).

III. FORCE-FORCE AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTION

The system under consideration is a two-component plasma consisting of electrons and ions which is described by
the semiclassical model introduced in Sec II. Let us choose the position of one of the charged particles (for example
an electron) as a reference point. Hereafter we call this particle the ﬁrst one. The semiclassical force acting on the
ﬁrst particle equals

uij being the eﬀective pair potential between the ith and jth particles, deﬁned in Eq. (7).
Deﬁne now two functions characterizing the dynamics of the ﬁrst particle. The ﬁrst one

is the velocity-velocity autocorrelation function (velocity acf), the second function

is the force-force autocorrelation function (force acf). In the above equations the brackets < . . . > denote averaging
over the equilibrium ensemble of the semiclassical system. The velocity acf is formally a function expressing the single
particle properties. However, it is connected with the force acf which involves the collective properties by the relation

Within this approximation we may distinguish between two regimes. In the ﬁrst regime - the “diﬀusion-regime” - one
deals with a large diﬀusion constant. As a result ν = βm1Dω2
1 > 2ω1 and Eq. (27) is the equation of an overdamped
oscillator. In this regime the velocity autocorrelation function goes monotoneously to zero. With decreasing diﬀusion
constant the damping constant ν becomes smaller. At certain thermodynamical conditions just the opposite inequality
ν < 2ω1 holds. This corresponds to an “oscillatory-regime” and at least one of the autocorrelation functions should
show an oscillatory behavior. The existence of the two regimes have been established for the case of an OCP [8] and
has been conﬁrmed by our molecular-dynamics simulation for the case of a TCP. To obtain not only a qualitative but
also a quantitative correspondence with the results of MD simulations one has to go beyond the simple approximation
n = 1 in the Nevanlinna formula Eq. (21).

Equations (32) constitute the basic approximation of our paper. The frequencies Ωi and the coeﬃcients Ci (or
di, respectively) are expressed by three parameters - the diﬀusion constant D, and the frequencies ω1 and ω2. The
constructed autocorrelation functions satisfy the following conditions: (i) the exact short time behavior for the velocity
acf is reproduced to the orders t2 and t4, (ii) the short time behavior of the force acf is reproduced to the order t2,
(iii) the long time behavior of the velocity acf generates the exact diﬀusion constant, and (iv) the connection between
the velocity and force acf’s Eq. (14) is satisﬁed.

The parameters D, ω1 and ω2 may be calculated by another approximations. The both frequencies ω1 and ω2
are expressable via the partial correlation functions of our semiclassical system. The parameter ω1 is given by the
electron-ion and electron-electron partial pair correlation functions. To calculate the frequency ω2 one needs the
knowledge of the partial ternary distribution functions. The diﬀusion constant may be obtained from kinetic theory.
In contrast to the case of an OCP [8] the parameters to be calculated are very sensitive to the approximations used
to calculate the static distribution functions. Therefore in this paper we take the “input” parameters directly from
the computer simulations.

To check the quality of the predictions from our approximation we have performed molecular dynamics simulations
for comparison. The equations of motions obtained with the eﬀective potential Eq.(7) were integrated numerically for
the case of equal masses me = mi using the leap-frog variant of Verlet’s algorithm. The simulations were performed
for 128 electrons and 128 positrons moving in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. In the investigated
range of plasma parameters (T = 30 000 K, the coupling parameter has varied from Γ = 0.2 up to Γ = 3) the size
of the simulation box was signiﬁcantly greater than the Debye radius. Therefore the long-range Coulomb forces are
screened inside each box and there was no need to use the Ewald summation instead the simple periodic boundary
conditions. The thermal equilibrium in the system was established (and maintained) by a Langevin source. Such
simulations has been recently used to obtain the static distribution of the electric microﬁeld at a charged particle [10].
In this paper we extract the velocity and force autocorrelation functions as the main characteristics of the microﬁeld
dynamics.

Except the case of the force acf at Γ = 0.2 there is a good overall agreement between the theoretical approximations
and the MD data. We believe that the strong deviation of the MD data from the theoretical predictions for Γ = 0.2 is
a numerical artefact due to the poor statistics in the weak coupling case. From the ﬁgures we see that with increasing
plasma parameter Γ the dynamics of the charged particles switches from the diﬀusion-like regime at Γ = 0.2 to the
oscillator-like motion at Γ = 3.0. The value Γ = 1.5 may be considered as a critical value separating the both regimes.
We may also see from the ﬁgures that the oscillator-like motion is more pronounced for the force acf.

At still higher densities (Γ

3 at T = 30 000 K) the semi-classical approach employed in this paper fails to describe

the quantum two-component plasma properly.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The electric microﬁeld dynamics at a charged particle in a two-component plasma has been studied. The quantum
plasma has been modeled by a semiclassical system with eﬀective potentials. The eﬀective potential was choosen to
describe the nondegenrate limit of the quantum system appropriately. We have investigated the velocity and force
acf’s of the semiclassical system. The starting point for the theoretical analysis was the exact expression of the
autocorrelation functions through the Nevanlinna formula Eq. (29), satisfying three sum rules for the velocity acf.
The approximation Eq. (30) together with Eq. (31) expresses the velocity acf in terms of three parameters. Two of
them - ω1 and ω2 - describe the exact short time behavior of the velocity acf up to the order t4, the third parameter,
the self-diﬀusion constant D is related to the time integral of the velocity acf. Since the force acf can be obtained
from the velocity acf by a second time derivative the force acf is expressed through the same three parameters. The
general picture is as follows. At weak coupling the diﬀusion of the charged particle dominates the collective plasma
oscillations and the particle motion is diﬀusion-like. In this regime the velocity acf decays exponentially with a decay
rate 1/D (time in units of the inverse electron plasma frequency ωpe). The force acf has a positive decay at short
times (decay rate ω2
1D) and a negative decay at long times (with the rate 1/D). At strong coupling the diﬀusion is
supressed and a weakly damped oscillatory behavior for the force acf developes. The theoretical predictions has been
compared with molecular dynamics simulations data. There is an overall agreement of the force dynamics obtained
by the analytical approximation with the MD data.

Finally, we mention that there is no one to one correspondence of the semiclassical autocorrelation functions with the
corresponding characteristics of the quantum system. Nevertheless, we suspect that the semiclassical force dynamics
considered in this paper at least qualitatively reproduces the electric microﬁeld dynamics of the quantum system.

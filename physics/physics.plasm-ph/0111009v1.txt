Abstract

We investigate the role of thermal instability, arising from radiative cooling of an
optically thin, dusty plasma, by linear stability analysis. The corresponding isobaric
stability condition for condensation mode is found to be modiﬁed signiﬁcantly by the
degree of ionization and concentration of ﬁnite sized, relatively heavy, and negatively
charged dust particles. It has been shown that though the fundamental wave mode
is similar in nature to the one in absence of dust particles, a new dust-wave mode
can propagate in such a plasma. It is conjectured that the presence of negatively
charged dust particles may considerably aﬀect the stability of various astrophysical
structures against thermal instability, which can not be explained with the help of
gravitational instability.

The formation and existence of a large number of astrophysical structures
such as interstellar clouds, solar prominence, localized structures in planetary
nebulae etc. can not be explained by means of conventional gravitational in-
stability [1]. However, it has been argued that thermal instability may be a
reasonably good candidate, with can accelerate condensation, giving rise to
localized structures which grow in density by loosing heat, mainly through
radiation [1,2]. The ﬁrst comprehensive analysis of thermal instability in a
diﬀuse interstellar gas is ﬁrst given by Field [2]. Subsequently, many authors
considered the process of thermal instability in diﬀerent circumstances e.g.
in hydrogen plasmas [3], to explain formation of clumpy gas clouds in two
phase medium [4], and thermal instabilities in photoioized interstellar gas [5].
Recently, Birk [7] has considered thermal condensations in a weakly ionized
hydrogen plasma.

In recent years, however, it has been realized that heavier dust particles consti-
tutes an ubiquitous and important component of many astrophysical plasmas.
[7–9] including interstellar clouds, stellar and planetary atmosphere, planetary
nebulae etc. It is, thus of particular interest to see the eﬀect of dust particles
on the role of thermal instability in astrophysical situations. One of the obvi-
ous facts of introducing dust as a component of plasma is the propagation of
very low frequency compressional modes [10]. We, in this paper, investigate
thermal instabilities in a multicomponent plasma with electrons, ions, and
dust particles, assuming that a ≪ d ≪ λD, where a is the average dust size, d
is the average inter-dust distance, and λD is the Debye length. We consider the
dust particles to be negatively charged and cold, whereas the ions can loose
energy through radiation by de-excitation. We further assume that electrons
are isothermal. We introduce a heat-loss function [2] exclusive of thermal con-
duction, which takes care of the radiative loss. For simplicity, we do not take
into account the dust-charge ﬂuctuation, which usually has a stabilizing ef-
fect [6]. The resultant equations are two-ﬂuid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
equations with Boltzmann distribution for the electrons. The dust acoustic
(DA) and dust-ion acoustic (DIA) modes [10] are ruled out by virtue of ‘cold
dust’ assumption. We show that the isobaric condition for thermal condensa-
tion mode is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the inclusion of dust dynamics. We also
ﬁnd the existence of a new wave mode, solely because of the presence of the
dust particles.

We begin by writing out the equations for a unbounded, weakly collisional
dusty plasma with a heat-loss function L(ρ, T ), which represents the rate of
net loss of energy per unit mass, through radiation. We consider the dust
particles to be negatively charged and cold and the electrons obey Boltzmann
relation. We assume here that that ion-neutral collisional cross-section is of the
same order as that of the electron-neutral collisions, so that the electrons can
be treated as Boltzmann distribution if (Ti/Te)(vT e/vT i) ≫ 1, and in practice
this condition is satisﬁed in the cases we are going to consider in this work.

where χi is the ion thermal conductivity, νI,R are ionization and recombination

e, i, d respectively refer to the electron, ion, and dust populations. Equa-
tions (1) through (6) are the continuity and momentum equations for dusts,
Boltzmann relation for the electrons, and continuity, momentum, and energy
equations for the ions. The set of equations is closed by the quasineutrality
condition,

Zini = ne + Zdnd,

(7)

where Zi,d represents the ion and dust charge numbers, respectively. Note
that we have taken into account the possibility of multiply ionized ions. The
ion pressure is given by pi = niTi (Tj are expressed in energy units) and we
have assumed that Γ, the ratio of speciﬁc heats for the ions to be 5/3. The
recombination loss term in the ion-continuity equation represents the electron-

d = ZdTe0/nd0. The quantities with
subscript ‘0’ and ‘1’ are equilibrium and perturbed quantities, respectively
and ‘˜’ represents normalized perturbed quantities. We have normalized the
perturbed densities of the species by their respective equilibrium values and
perturbed electrostatic potential energy eφ1 by equilibrium electron thermal
energy, ˜φ = eφ1/Te0. The quantities δj = nj0/ni0 are the ratios of equilibrium
electron and dust densities to that of the ions for j = e, d.

Before numerically solving the dispersion relation Eq.(15), however, it is in-

so that we can safely assume ωd ≪ ω. To the leading order, we have the

Note that for zero thermal-conductivity, ωT = kT ci and the above conditions
are independent of k. The conditions given by inequalities (18) and (19) are
similar to the isobaric instability condition given by Field [2], modiﬁed by
collisions and dust particles. We observe that the presence of a signiﬁcant
dust population (smaller δe) considerably modiﬁes the instability criteria for
the condensation mode and has a stabilizing eﬀect. It is interesting to note
that the degree of ionization has also a similar eﬀect on the stability of the
condensation mode which becomes important in certain situations. For exam-
ple, in condensations observed in planetary nebulae, the thermal instability
is strongly associated with collisions of electrons with N+ and N++ ions [2].
It should, however, be noted that the conditions (18) and (19) do not reduce
to one given by Field even in absence of dust particles, which is because our
consideration of two-ﬂuid approximation.

The inequality (18) also implies that the growth rate of the condensation
mode is independent of the wave number in the short wavelength limit, when
the thermal-conductivity is zero in opposite to a thermally conducting plasma
(ﬁnite kK), where there is no condensation for suﬃciently larger k. Plots of
the normalized growth rate (ˆω = ω/ωρ) versus normalized wave number (ˆk =

The growth rate of the mode is deﬁnitely smaller in presence of dust particles,
as we have guessed, but note the lengthening of the cut-oﬀ wave number.
In fact, the knees of the lower curves with ﬁnite kK prove to a bifurcation
point in a collisional plasma, as we shall see shortly. The parameters for Fig.1
are ˆkT = kT /kρ = 0.2, Zi = 1, Zd = 100, Te0 = Ti0 = 10 ◦K, md/mi = 108,
ni0 = 10−3 cm−3, and nd0 = 10−6 cm−3. These values are typical for interstellar
clouds [12].

An approximation similar to Eq.(17) for collisionless wave modes is given by

The instability criteria for a growing wave mode is thus (ωρ + 2/3ωT ) < 0,
which is just the isentropic instability criteria, given by Field [2]. We can
thus argue that the principal wave mode is unaﬀected by the presence of dust
particles, but for a decrease in magnitude, dictated by the term (5+3Ziτ /δe)−1,
which proportional to δe/Z 2
i . However, there is one more wave mode which
is not apparent from the above analysis. We can detect the latter only by
appropriately solving Eq.(15), numerically. In Fig.2, we show the the growing-
wave modes in a collisionless plasma with considerable dust presence as in case
of a planetary nebula [13]. There is a purely dust-wave mode (second ﬁgure
in Fig.2) which is otherwise absent in a pure electron-ion plasma. The growth
rate of the mode is, however, much smaller. Notice the cut-oﬀs in all these
curves. These ﬁgures are with ˆkT = −2, ˆk−1
K = 0.01, Zi = 2, Zd = 100 and
nd0 = 10−5 cm−3, all other parameters being same as in Fig.1. The value of ˆkK
is typical in planetary nebulae. We have chosen a large negative value for ˆkT
so as to drive the wave mode unstable (see Eq.(20)). Note that a condensation
mode will always accompany these wave modes (not shown) as the condition

In Fig.3, we show the growth rates of modes with collisional eﬀects. The solid
curves represent condensation modes and the dashed one represents the wave
mode. We see a merger of the condensation modes to a growing wave mode
at a bifurcation point near ˆk ≃ 4.0.

We should emphasize that we do not have an explicit expression for the in-
terstellar heat-loss function L(ρ, T ) in general, because of an wide variety
of compositions of material in diﬀerent interstellar regions. Besides, several
heating and cooling mechanisms may be operative simultaneously and their
dependence on local density and temperature may not be known exactly. Del-
garno and McCray [14], in their classic review, have mentioned about diﬀer-
ent cooling processes in HI regions. A relatively concise expression for the
heat-loss function in photo-ionized interstellar gases with high metallicity is
given by Corbelli and Ferrara [5]. In the simplest case, for radiative cool-
ing, the heat-loss function can be assumed to be proportional to ρnpm, where
n = 5/2, m = −1/2 for free-bound transitions and n = 3/2, m = +1/2 for
free-free transitions [3,14,15]. However, the exact form the heat-loss function
is not important at this point. As a prototype example, we assume the heat-

where ¯T is the mean excess ionization temperature of N+ ions. The tempera-
tures are given in the units of TN+ = 21800 ◦K, the mean excitation tempera-
ture of the N+ level. Applying the instability condition (19) in the collisionless
case, we have, thermal condensation if,

T−( ¯T , ζ) < T < T+( ¯T , ζ),

where ζ = (1 + 1/δe) and

T±( ¯T , ζ) = [2ζ + ˆkK ¯T (2 + ζ) ± {[2ζ + ˆkK ¯T (2 + ζ)]2

− 8ˆkK ¯T ζ(2 + 3ζ)}1/2](4 + 6ζ)−1.

For simplicity, we have assumed Te0 = Ti0 and Zi = 1. The above expression
of T± reduces to usual one when ζ = 1 (single-ﬂuid approximation). For ˆkK =
3/2, Zd = 100, ni0 = 10−3 cm−3, nd0 = 10−7 cm−3, and ¯T = 4.5, we have T± =
1.3293 − 2.542, which in absence of dust becomes 0.7248 − 3.7254 [2]. So, the
presence of dust provides a stabilizing eﬀect against radiative condensations.
However, the range of instability shrinks to zero at ¯T = 3.902, much higher
than 1.974, which is for the dust-less case. This implies that for a planetary
nebula with a considerable amount of dust particles, to be stable against the
radiative condensation mode, it has to be at a much higher temperature. In
Fig.4, we show the range of unstable temperature with δe. Note that a lower
value of δe corresponds to higher dust concentration.

To conclude, we have found that the instability criterion for the thermal con-
densation mode is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the presence of dust particles, which

8

can severely alter the stability regimes of many astrophysical condensations
where a signiﬁcant number of dust particles are present. The fundamental
wave mode is similar in both cases with and without dust particles, though
we now have another wave mode, which is due to the presence of dust parti-
cles. Finally, we have shown that the conventional stability regimes of many
astrophysical condensations may be considerably changed.

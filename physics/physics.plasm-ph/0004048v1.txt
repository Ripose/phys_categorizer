EXCITATION OF NONLINEAR TWO-DIMENSIONAL WAKE

WAVES IN RADIALLY-NONUNIFORM PLASMA

It is shown that an undesirable curvature of the wave front of two-
dimensional nonlinear wake wave excited in uniform plasma by a relativistic
charged bunch or laser pulse may be compensated by radial change of the
equilibrium plasma density.

PACS number(s): 52.40.Mj, 52.40.Nk, 52.75.Di, 52.35.Mw

The progress in the technology of ultrahigh intensity lasers and high cur-
rent relativistic charged bunch sources permits the use of laser pulses [1]
or charged bunches [2] for excitation of strong plasma waves. The excited
plasma waves can be used both for acceleration of charged particles and
focusing of bunches to get high luminosity in the linear colliders [2]. At
present the plasma-based accelerator concepts are actively developed both
theoretically and experimentally (see the overview in Ref. [3] and references
therein).

The amplitude of longitudinal electric ﬁeld Emax in relativistic wake-waves
excited in cold plasma is limited by the relativistic wave-breaking ﬁeld [4]
Erel = [2(γ − 1)]1/2EW B/β, where γ = (1 − β 2)−1/2 is a relativistic factor,
β = vph/c is a dimensionless phase velocity of the wave, EW B = meωpevph/e
(EW B[V /cm] ≈ 0.96n1/2
[cm−3]) is the conventional nonrelativistic wave-
breaking ﬁeld, ωpe = (4πnpe2/me)1/2 is the electron plasma frequency, np is
the equilibrium density of plasma electrons, me and e are the mass and abso-
lute value of the electron charge. The acceleration rate in the wake ﬁelds can
reach tens of GeV /m, that much exceeds the rates reached in conventional
accelerators.

The linear wake-ﬁeld theory is valid when Emax ≪ EW B. In case of wake
wave excitation by relativistic charged particle bunch [Plasma Wakeﬁeld Ac-

1

celerator (PWFA)] this corresponds to the condition α = |q| nb(cid:30)enp ≪ 1 [2],
where q is the charge of bunch particles, nb is their concentration. In the
scheme of wake wave excitation by a short laser pulse (of the length compa-
rable with plasma wavelength λp = 2πvph(cid:30)ωpe; Laser Wakeﬁeld Accelerator
(LWFA)), the linear theory is valid when a2 = e2E 2
0) ≪ 1 [5],
where ω0 ≫ ωpe and E0 are the frequency and amplitude of laser radiation
respectively. The phase velocity of the wake wave is equal to the bunch ve-
locity vb in PWFA and to the laser pulse group velocity vg ≈ c(1 − ω2
pe/2ω2
0)
( that corresponds to γ = γg ≈ ω0/ωpe ≫ 1) in LWFA.

The one-dimensional nonlinear wake waves excited by wide drivers (when
kprd ≫ 1, where kp = ωpe/vph is the wavenumber and rd is the radius of
the driver) are studied in suﬃcient detail both for PWFA [6] and for LWFA
[7]. These studies testify to the feasibility of excitation of strong nonlinear
plasma waves with the amplitude of up to Erel by bunches with α & 0.5 and
laser pulses with a2 & 1. The other important results of the one-dimensional
nonlinear theory are the steepening of the wake wave and the increase of
wavelength with amplitude. The wave with the amplitude Emax ≈ Erel has
the wavelength nearly γ1/2 times as large as the linear wavelength λp.

In reality, the transverse sizes of the drivers used are ordinarily compa-
rable or less than their longitudinal size. The allowance for ﬁnite transverse
sizes of the drivers and, accordingly, the transverse motion of plasma elec-
trons complicate the treatment of the problem in the nonlinear regime. In
the general case the analytical solution of this regime seems impossible and
here the use of numerical methods are usually required. The numerical inves-
tigation of nonlinear eﬀects in two-dimensional (axially-symmetrical) wake
waves exited in uniform plasma has shown that in the nonlinear regime the
wavelength becomes dependent on the transverse (relative to the driver prop-
agation direction) coordinate [3,8-10]. The change of a nonlinear wavelength
in the transverse direction is due to the dependence of wavelength on the
amplitude, that, in its turn, is varied in the radial direction owing to ﬁnite
cross section of the driver. This leads to a curvature of the phase front of
the nonlinear wave [8-10], to steepening and ”oscillations” of the ﬁeld in the
transverse direction [10,11] and eventually to the development of turbulence.
From the viewpoint of acceleration and focusing of charged bunches in the
wave, the curvature of the nonlinear wave front is undesired as the quality
(emittance, monochromaticity) of the driven bunch worsens. In the present
work we show that by means of wake wave excitation in plasma, the den-
sity of which is properly varied in the transverse direction, one can eliminate

2

the nonlinear change of wavelength in the transverse direction and the re-
lated curvature of phase front. The plasma of this kind may be produced
by charged beams [12] or laser pulses [13] passing through a neutral gas or a
partially ionized uniform plasma due to an additional ionization.

Equations for non-zero components of plasma electrons momentum and
electromagnetic ﬁeld describing the steady nonlinear wake-ﬁelds in radially-
nonuniform plasma can be obtained by simple generalization of equations for
uniform plasma [10,11,14,15]:

In Eqs. (1) - (6) γe = (1 + P 2
ne/np(r = 0) are respectively a relativistic factor, dimensionless components
of velocity and dimensionless density of plasma electrons, Np = np(r)/np(0),
β = vph/c, z = kp(r = 0)(Z − vpht), ∇⊥ = ∂/∂r + 1/r. Also the following
dimensionless variables have been used: the space variables are normalized
on λp(r = 0)/2π = 1/kp(r = 0), the momenta and velocities - respectively
on mec and the velocity of light and the strengths of electric and magnetic
ﬁelds - on the nonrelativistic wave-breaking ﬁeld at the axis EW B(r = 0) =
meωpe(r = 0)vph/e. The ﬁeld of forces acting on relativistic electrons in the
excited ﬁeld is F(−eEz, −e(Er − βHθ), 0). In PWFA α 6= 0, a2 = 0 and in

3

LWFA α = 0, a2 6= 0 (in Eqs. (1)-(6) the linear polarization of the laser
pulse ﬁeld is assumed; for the circular polarization the value of a should be
multiplied by the factor 21/2).

We have solved Eqs. (1)-(6) numerically choosing the Gaussian proﬁle of

the driver both in longitudinal and transverse directions:

A(z, r) = A0 exp[−(z − z0)2/σ2

z] exp(−r2/σ2

r),

(8)

where A(z, r) stands for α = nb(z, r)/np(r = 0) or a2(z, r). Shown in Fig. 1 is
the nonlinear 2D plasma wake wave excited in uniform plasma [Np(r) = 1] by
the relativistic electron bunch (α0 = 0.4, σz = 2, σr = 5; for example, in this
case nb0 = 4 × 1013cm−3 and the characteristic longitudinal and transverse
sizes of the bunch σz,r/kp correspondingly are 1.06mm and 2.65mm when
np = 1014cm−3). One can see that the wavelength changes with the radial
coordinate r. This leads to curving of the phase front and to ”oscillations” in
the transverse direction (see Fig. 2, curve 1). As |z| increases, the change of
phase in transverse direction (for ﬁxed z) becomes more and more marked.
The longitudinal space parameter characterizing the nonlinear wave front
curving is [10]:

ξ =

λp

2[1 − λp/Λ(0)]

,

(9)

where Λ(r) is the nonlinear wavelength. At the distance |∆z| ≈ ξ from the
driver the oscillation phase at the axis (r = 0) is opposite to that on the
periphery (r & σr). Thus, in 2D nonlinear regime the nonlinear wavelength
changes with r due to nonlinear increase of the wavelength with wave ampli-
tude. On the other hand, the linear wavelength λp ∼ n−1/2
decreases with
equilibrium density of plasma. Hence follows an opportunity to compensate
the nonlinear increase in wavelength by reducing the wavelength that is due
to the growth of equilibrium density of plasma. Indeed, assume that the non-
linear wavelength of the two-dimensional wake wave in the uniform plasma
Λ(r) is known. Then, one can roughly compensate for the radial variation of
the nonlinear wavelength by changing the equilibrium density of plasma in
the radial direction according to the relation

p

Λ(0)/Λ(r) = λp(r)/λp(0) = [np(0)/np(r)]1/2.

(10)

In this case the equation for equiphase surfaces is z ≈ const, and, therefore,
the solution for ﬁelds could be written in the form f1(z)f2(r). If we put that

4

the function Λ(r) is Gaussian (that is approximately the case at least for
r < σr, according to numerical data for proﬁles (8)), then one can take the
transverse proﬁle of the equilibrium plasma density to be also Gaussian:

Then follows from Eqs. (10) and (11) that

np(r) = np0 exp(−r2/σ2

p).

σp = r/[ln(Λ(0)/Λ(r))]1/2.

(11)

(12)

For example, according to (12), the numerical data for Λ(r) in the nonlinear
wave shown in Fig.1 give σp ≈ 11. Thus, in the radially nonuniform plasma,
the density of which is changed according to (11) and (12), one can practically
avoid undesirable curvature of the wave front of a nonlinear wave. Figs. 3 and
4 illustrate the validity of this assertion respectively for PWFA and LWFA
(see also Fig.2, curve 2). One can see, that the nonlinear wavelength in the
nonuniform plasma with proper radial proﬁle does not practically change in
the transverse direction.

As for the case of LWFA, one has to note that as is well known, without
optical guiding the diﬀraction limits the distance of laser-plasma interaction
(and, hence, the energy gain of particles accelerated by a wake wave) to a few
Reyleigh lengths ZR = πr2
0/λ, where r0 the minimum laser pulse spot size at
the focal point and λ is the laser wavelength. For high-intensity laser pulses
the quantity ZR is usually of the order of several millimeters. One of ap-
proaches in preventing of diﬀraction broadening of laser pulse and increasing
of laser-plasma interaction distance is the guiding of the pulse in preformed
plasma density channel [3]. Here the unperturbed plasma density grows from
the pulse axis (r = 0) to its periphery, in contrast with the radial proﬁle of
the plasma density that was proposed above for prevention of phase front cur-
vature of a nonlinear wake wave when the plasma density at the driver axis
is maximum. In case of nonlinear wake wave excitation by high power laser
pulses (of power P > Pc = 2c(e/re)2[ω0/ωpe(r = 0)]2 ≈ 17[ω0/ωpe(r = 0)]2
GW , where re = e2/mec2 is the classical electron radius), the process of
diﬀraction broadening of a larger part of pulse, including the case of proposed
equilibrium proﬁle of plasma, may be prevented or essentially retarded due
to the relativistic self-focusing [3]. One can estimate the condition of rela-
tivistic self-focusing in our case from the following relation (see, e. g. Sec.
[3]): P/Pc > 1 + (∆n/∆nc)(rs/r0)4, where rs is the spot size,

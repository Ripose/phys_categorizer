It is shown that absorption of ions by the dust grain may reduce the eﬀective translational

temperature of the dust component below the ambient gas temperature.

I. INTRODUCTION

The kinetic theory of dusty plasmas, which takes into account speciﬁc processes of charging, has been considered on
phenomenological basis and used for diﬀerent applications in [1,2]. The form of charging collision integrals considered
in these papers has been recently rigorously justiﬁed in [3,4], where also the stationary solution of kinetic equation for
charge and velocity distributions of grains were established. As it has been established in [3] the process of absorption
of the small particles by grains in dusty plasmas can lead to inequality of the grain temperature and the temperatures
of the light components (even for the case of equal temperatures of electrons and ions).

At the same time the preliminary results of MD simulations for the kinetic energy of dust particles [5] demonstrated
that mass transfer from light components to dust can be essential for the large time scale. The problem of mass transfer
is also very actual for the conditions of the experiments with growth of grains [6] and formation of new materials [7] in
dusty plasmas, as well as for many other applications. Therefore the appropriate kinetic theory should be developed,
in which a new kinetic variable — the mass of grains — must be introduced [8].

In this paper we will consider kinetics of the dust particles with variable mass, which increases due to absorption of
the ambient plasma and determine the nonstationary distribution function for the grains. It is shown that asymptot-
ically the eﬀective temperature of the dust component is lower than the stationary temperature of the gas. It means
the mass growth leads to the cooling of the dust component.

II. KINETIC EQUATIONS

Since our main purpose here is to demonstrate the importance of the mass growth, we simplify the problem ignoring
the grain charge. In other words, we treat a plasma as a neutral gas. We adopt here that in process of an elementary
collision a grain absorbs every atom hitting its surface. An atom transfers its momentum to a grain and, respectively,
the mass of a grain changes. Therefore generally the distribution function of the dust component depends both on
grain momenta, P, and masses, M .

It should noted that the assumption of the complete absorption seems justiﬁed under the conditions of the experi-
ments aimed at the plasma synthesis of ﬁne grains [6,7]. Otherwise, an ion hitting the grain surface rather leaves it
as a neutral atom carrying away some momentum. The latter may be ignored if the surface temperature of a grain
is, by some means, below the ion temperature.

The appropriate kinetic equation describing the process may be written as

dfd(P, M, t)

dt

= Id(P, M, t) =

Z dpfn(p) {w(p, P − p, M − m)fd(P − p, M − m) − w(p, P, M )fd(P, M )} ,

(1)

where fn(p) is the distribution function of neutral atoms of the mass m. The probability of absorption is given by

M

−

,

(2)

p

m(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where the cross-section, σ(M ), generally is mass dependent. For example, assuming the permanent speciﬁc gravity of
the grain material results in σ(M ) ∝ M 2/3. The distribution function in Eq. (1) is normalized to the average density:

The evolution of the neutral gas distribution is governed by

nd = Z dPdM fd(P, M ).

dfn(p)

dt

= −Z dPdM w(p, P, M )fd(P, M )fn(p).

Evidently, the set of kinetic equations (1,3) provides the conservation of the net number of dust grains and the total
momentum. The total energy is no longer conserving quantity. The physical reason for this is fairly obvious: a part
of kinetic energy of a colliding atom is transferred to the kinetic energy of a dust grain, while the remainder is spend
for the heating of the grain surface. The latter part of the energy balance is out of our consideration.

The collision term in Eq. (1) is greatly simpliﬁed by expanding it in powers of a small ǫ = m/M ratio. Straightfor-

ward expansion of Eq. (1) results in

Id(P, M ) =

∂

∂Pi (cid:20)−βig(P, M ) + λij Pj g(P, M ) +

where g(P, M ) = σ(M )fd(P, M ). The kinetic coeﬃcients introduced in Eq. (4) are expressed in terms of the gas
distribution:

βi = Z dp

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (4) arises due to the possible anisotrophy of the ambient gas distribution. Formally, this term
is proportional to ǫ1/2. The remaining terms describing diﬀusion in the phase space and mass growth are of the order
ǫ.

With suﬃciently small number of dust grains one can ignore the deviation of ambient gas from initial distribution.
Assuming that fn(p) is given by Maxwellian distribution with the temperature, Tn, and particle density, nn, we get

where it is also supposed that the dust distribution is isotropic. The coeﬃcient, j0, in Eq. (9) is the mass ﬂow at the

grain surface, j0 = nnp8Tn/π.

It should be noted that with the last term in the right-hand side of Eq. (9) omitted, i.e., in neglecting the process
of the mass growth, there is an exact stationary solution to Eq. (9) in the form of Maxwellian function with the
temperature Td = 2Tn. The same conclusion stems also from the more general approach of [3].

III. TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION

With the help of Eq. (9) we study the evolution of the temperature of the dust component. Although it is possible
to obtain the general solution to Eq. (9), the corresponding expression is rather bulky (see Appendix) and little
informative. To grasp the rˆole of the mass growth one can neglect the mass dispersion of the dust component looking
for the solution in the form of

Substituting this into Eq. (9) yields

fd(P, M, t) = F (P, t)δ(M − µ(t)).

Eq. (11) shows that the mass of all grains increases with the rate determined by the current value of the cross-section.

The solution to the second equation (12) is sought in the form of the Maxwellian distribution

F (P, t) =

with the time-varying eﬀective temperature, ∆ = Tef f (t)µ(t). Substituting Eq. (13) to Eq. (12) we get

(14)

In neglecting the mass growth, as it was already mentioned, the stationary state of the dust component is char-
acterized by the eﬀective temperature twice as the gas temperature, Tef f = 2Tn. However, the joint solution of
Eqs. (11,14) results in

Tef f (t) =

Tn + Cµ(t)−5/3,

(15)

where C is an integration constant. Thus, the mass growth yields cooling of the dust component below the gas
temperature, Tef f → 4

5 Tn.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have considered the kinetic equation for the ensemble of grains imposed in neutral gas. The process of gas
absorption by grains leads to the time dependence of grain distribution function due to the mass growth of the dust
particles. For the Maxwellian distribution of neutral gas we found the general nonstationary solution of the kinetic
equation with variable mass. The average kinetic energy of grains, that is, the eﬀective temperature of the dust
component, tend to the stationary values. The process of establishing of the eﬀective temperature can be interpreted
in this case as an eﬀective cooling.

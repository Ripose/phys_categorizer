Abstract. The foundations of gyrokinetic theory are reviewed with an
emphasis on the applications of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods
used in the derivation of nonlinear gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equa-
tions. These reduced dynamical equations describe the turbulent evolu-
tion of low-frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctuations in nonuniform mag-
netized plasmas with arbitrary magnetic geometry.

1 Introduction

The development of gyrokinetic theory was initially motivated by the need to
describe complex plasma dynamics over time scales that are long compared to the
short gyration time scale of a charged particle about a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld
line. Thus, gyrokinetic theory was built upon a generalization of guiding-center
theory (see Refs. [1] and [2]). In Ref. [3], for example, Taylor showed that, while
the guiding-center magnetic-moment invariant can be destroyed by low-frequency,
short perpendicular-wavelength electrostatic ﬂuctuations, a new magnetic-moment
invariant can be constructed as an asymptotic expansion in powers of the amplitude
of the perturbation ﬁeld. This early result indicated that gyrokinetic theory was to
be built upon an additional transformation beyond the guiding-center phase-space
coordinates, thereby constructing new gyrocenter phase-space coordinates, which
describe gyroangle-averaged perturbed guiding-center dynamics. The purpose of
the present paper is to review the foundations of gyrokinetic theory by presenting
the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods used in the derivation of self-consistent,
energy-conserving gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations describing the nonlinear
turbulent evolution of low-frequency, short perpendicular-wavelength electromag-
netic ﬂuctuations in nonuniform magnetized plasmas.

Although a comprehensive review of the applications of gyrokinetic theory mer-
its a separate paper, we brieﬂy point out, here, that applications are generally di-
vided into applications based on linearized gyrokinetic equations and applications
based on nonlinear gyrokinetic equations. On the one hand, linear gyrokinetic

theory (see Refs. [4]-[10], for example) is concerned with the stability of inhomoge-
neous magnetized plasmas perturbed by low-frequency electromagnetic perturba-
tions (which preserve the gyrocenter magnetic moment, or ﬁrst adiabatic invariant).
Nonlinear gyrokinetic theory (see Refs. [11]-[16]), on the other hand, focuses its at-
tention on the anomalous transport associated with low-frequency electromagnetic
ﬂuctuations in inhomogeneous magnetized plasmas. Gyrokinetic particle simulation
techniques (see Refs. [17]-[20]) now play a major role in the investigation of low-
frequency plasma turbulence and its associated transport in magnetized plasmas
[21].

The remaining material is organized as follows.

In Sec. 2, we introduce the
variational principles in eight-dimensional extended phase space that are necessary
to present a consistent time-dependent Hamiltonian perturbation theory for single-
particle dynamics. Here, and throughout the paper, the language of diﬀerential
forms is strongly emphasized within the context of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
mechanics [22].
In Sec. 3, the phase-space Lagrangian Lie-transform perturba-
tion method, which allows a simultaneous dynamical reduction of the Hamiltonian
and Poisson-bracket structure for single-particle dynamics, is brieﬂy presented. In
Sec. 4, the phase-space Lagrangian Lie-perturbation method is used to derive gyro-
center Hamiltonian dynamics by a time-dependent phase-space transformation from
guiding-center coordinates to gyrocenter coordinates. Here, we choose a Hamilton-
ian formulation that preserves the guiding-center Poisson-bracket structure and
carries all ﬁeld perturbations onto the gyrocenter Hamiltonian.

In Sec. 5, we show how a self-consistent set of nonlinear gyrokinetic Vlasov-
Maxwell equations can be derived from a reduced variational principle. The reduced
variational principle is itself shown to be derived from a variational principle for
the exact Vlasov-Maxwell equations also presented in Sec. 5. We also show how the
Noether method can be used to derive exact conservation laws for the exact and
gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations. Lastly, we summarize the work presented
here and discuss extensions of the standard gyrokinetic formalism in Sec. 6.

2 Variational Principles for
Extended Single-Particle Phase-Space Dynamics

This Section presents a brief introduction to the extended phase-space La-
grangian formulation of charged-particle dynamics in a time-dependent electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. Here, the electromagnetic ﬁeld is represented by the potentials
(Φ, A), while the eight-dimensional extended phase-space noncanonical coordinates
= (x, v, w, t) include the position x of a charged particle (mass m and charge e),

Z
its velocity v, and the canonically-conjugate time-energy (t, w) coordinates.

Note that the Hamiltonian orbit parameter τ can be identiﬁed with the time coor-

2.2 Single-particle perturbation theory in extended phase space. It
turns out that the eight-dimensional extended phase space provides a natural setting
for time-dependent Hamiltonian perturbation theory. A variational formulation of

We note that the order of time evolution (τ -ﬂow) and perturbation evolution
(ǫ-ﬂow) should be immaterial (i.e., we may evolve the system along its reference
orbit and then perturb it its ﬁnal state, or perturb the initial state and evolve the
perturbed orbit to the same ﬁnal state). The commutativity of the two Hamiltonian
Γ′ in
(τ, ǫ) ﬂows, therefore, leads to the path independence of the action integral

paths C and C with identical end points on the (τ, ǫ)-parameter space and calculat-

3 Lie-transform Perturbation Theory

The Hamiltonian perturbation equation (14) arises naturally within the con-
text of the dynamical reduction of single-particle Hamilton’s equations (12) through
the elimination of fast orbital time scales. The most eﬃcient method for deriving
reduced Hamilton’s equations is based on Hamiltonian [26] and phase-space La-
grangian [27] Lie-transform perturbation methods.

expected quadratic nonlinearity associated with a perturbed canonical representa-
tion in which only the perturbation vector potential A1 appears in the expression
for the reduced momentum coordinates. The second term, on the other hand,

The standard gyrokinetic analysis for magnetized plasmas perturbed by low-
frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctuations [15] proceeds by a sequence of two near-
identity phase-space transformations: a time-independent guiding-center phase-
space transformation and a time-dependent gyrocenter phase-space transformation.

4.1 Unperturbed guiding-center Hamiltonian dynamics. The guiding-
center phase-space transformation involves an asymptotic expansion, with a small
dimensionless parameter ǫB
1 deﬁned as the ratio of the characteristic
gyroradius ρ and the background magnetic-ﬁeld length scale LB. This transfor-
mation is designed to remove the fast gyromotion time scale associated with the
time-independent background magnetic ﬁeld B0 associated with an unperturbed
magnetized plasma [2]. In previous work [9], this transformation was carried out
to second order in ǫB with the scalar potential Φ0 ordered at zeroth order in ǫB.

The results of the guiding-center analysis presented in Ref. [2] are summarized
as follows. First, the guiding-center transformation yields the following guiding-
center coordinates (R, pk, µ, θ, w, t)
gc, where R is the guiding-center position,
pk is the guiding-center kinetic momentum parallel to the unperturbed magnetic
ﬁeld, µ is the guiding-center magnetic moment, θ is the gyroangle, and (w, t) are
the canonically conjugate guiding-center energy-time coordinates (here, time is un-
aﬀected by the transformation while the guiding-center energy is chosen to be equal
to the particle energy). Next, the unperturbed guiding-center extended phase-space
Lagrangian is

4.2 Perturbed guiding-center Hamiltonian dynamics. We now consider
how the guiding-center Hamiltonian dynamics is aﬀected by the introduction of
low-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (Φ1, A1). These ﬂuctuations are
assumed to satisfy the low-frequency gyrokinetic ordering [11, 15]:

small dimensionless ordering parameter associated with the electromagnetic per-
turbations space-time scales, with ω denoting the characteristic wave frequency,
kk the characteristic parallel wavenumber and k⊥ the characteristic perpendicular
wavevector (both with respect to the unperturbed magnetic ﬁeld B0).

Under the electromagnetic perturbations (Φ1, A1), the guiding-center phase-

space Lagrangian (40) and Hamiltonian (41) become

where the zeroth-order guiding-center phase-space Lagrangian Γgc0 and Hamilton-

three small parameters (ǫB, ǫδ, ǫω) may be of the same order in practice, we keep
them separate in order to retain the correct quadratic nonlinearities in the reduced
Hamiltonian dynamics. In Eq. (44), the ﬁrst-order guiding-center phase-space La-
grangian Γgc1 and Hamiltonian

of (Φ1, A1) is not shown explicitly for simplicity and, to lowest order in ǫB, we
ignore the spatial dependence of ρ.

Because of the gyroangle-dependence in the guiding-center perturbation poten-
tials (Φ1gc, A1gc), the guiding-center magnetic moment µ is no longer conserved by
the perturbed guiding-center equations of motion, i.e.,
(ǫδ). To remove the
gyroangle-dependence from the perturbed guiding-center phase-space Lagrangian

space transformation

We have, thus, obtained a reduced (gyroangle-independent) gyrocenter Hamil-
tonian description of charged-particle motion in nonuniform magnetized plasmas
perturbed by low-frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctuations. At this level, the nonlin-
ear gyrokinetic Vlasov equation can be used to study the evolution of a distribution
of test -gyrocenters in the presence of low-frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctuations.
For a self-consistent treatment that include an electromagnetic ﬁeld response to
the gyrocenter Hamiltonian dynamics, a set of low-frequency Maxwell’s equations
with charge and current densities expressed in terms of moments of the gyrocenter
Vlasov distribution is required.

5 Variational Principles for Exact and Reduced

In this Section, we plan to derive the nonlinear self-consistent gyrokinetic
Vlasov-Maxwell equations from a reduced variational principle. This reduced vari-
ational principle will also be used to derive an exact energy conservation law for
the reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equations. We begin this Section with the variational
principle for the exact Vlasov-Maxwell equations [31].

tional principle based on the action functional (53) involving the extended Vlasov
distribution
and the four-potential Aµ. Exact energy-momentum conservation
laws have also been derived by an application of the Noether method.

6 Summary

Through the use of Lie-transform perturbation methods on extended particle
phase space, we have derived a set of nonlinear low-frequency gyrokinetic Vlasov-
Maxwell equations describing the reduced Hamiltonian description of gyrocen-
ter dynamics in a time-independent background magnetic ﬁeld perturbed by low-
frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctuations. A self-consistent treatment is obtained
through a low-frequency gyrokinetic variational principle and an exact gyrokinetic
energy conservation law is obtained by applying the Noether method. Throughout
the work, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods (and diﬀerential geometry) in
eight-dimensional extended phase space were emphasized.

Further developments in gyrokinetic theory not presented here include nonlin-
ear relativistic gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations [34] and nonlinear bounce-
center Hamiltonian dynamics [35, 36] (based on the asymptotic elimination of the
fast bounce-motion time scale from the gyrocenter Hamiltonian dynamics).

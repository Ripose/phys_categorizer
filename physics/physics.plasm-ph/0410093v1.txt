A comprehensive analytical theory for nonlinear excitations related to horizontal (longitudinal,
acoustic mode) as well as vertical (transverse, optical mode) motion of charged dust grains in a dust
crystal is presented. Diﬀerent types of localized excitations, similar to those well known in solid
state physics, are reviewed and conditions for their occurrence and characteristics in dusty plasma
crystals are discussed. By employing a continuum approximation (i.e. assuming a long variation
scale, with respect to the inter-particle distance) a dust crystal is shown to support nonlinear kink-
shaped supersonic solitary excitations, associated with longitudinal dust grain displacement, as well
as modulated envelope localized modes associated with either longitudinal or transverse oscillations.
Although a one-dimensional crystal is considered for simplicity, the results in principle apply to a
two-dimensional lattice if certain conditions are satisﬁed. The eﬀect of mode-coupling is also brieﬂy
considered. The relation to previous results on atomic chains, and also to experimental results on
strongly-coupled dust layers in gas discharge plasmas, is brieﬂy discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Dust contaminated plasmas (dusty plasmas, DP) have been attracting signiﬁcant interest recently. Particularly
important are dust quasi-lattices, which are typically formed in the sheath region above the negative electrode in
discharge experiments, horizontally suspended at a levitated equilibrium position at z = z0, where gravity and electric
(and/or magnetic) forces balance. The linear regime of low-frequency oscillations in DP crystals, in the longitudinal
(acoustic mode) and transverse (in-plane, shear acoustic mode and vertical, oﬀ-plane optical mode) direction(s), is
now quite well understood. However, the nonlinear behaviour of DP crystals is still mostly unexplored, and has lately
attracted experimental [1 - 3] and theoretical [1 - 9] interest.

Recently [5], we considered the coupling between the horizontal (∼ ˆx) and vertical (oﬀ-plane, ∼ ˆz) degrees of
freedom in a dust mono-layer; a set of nonlinear equations for longitudinal and transverse dust lattice waves (LDLWs,
TDLWs) was thus rigorously derived [5]. Here, we review the nonlinear dust grain excitations which may occur in a
DP crystal (here assumed quasi-one-dimensional and inﬁnite, composed from identical grains, of equilibrium charge q
and mass M , located at xn = n r0, n ∈ N ). Ion-wake and ion-neutral interactions (collisions) are omitted, at a ﬁrst
step. This study complements recent experimental investigations [1-3] and may hopefully motivate future ones.

Recall that Fe/m(z0) = M g. Notice the diﬀerence in structure from the usual nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation used
to describe 1d one-dimensional oscillator chains: TDLWs (‘phonons’ ) in this chain are stable only in the presence of
thanks to the ﬁeld force Fe/m (via ωg). It should be stressed that the validity of this anharmonicity hypothesis is
indeed suggested real discharge experiments, in particular for low pressure and/or density values, and also conﬁrmed
by ab initio models [13] (see Fig. 1).

Linear transverse dust-lattice excitations, viz. δzn ∼ cos φn (here φn = nkr0 − ωt) obey the optical-like discrete

dispersion relation [14]:

is positive for all known experimental values of the anharmonicity coeﬃcients α, β [3]. For long wavelengths [i.e.
k < kcr, where P (kcr) = 0], the theory [7] predicts that TDLWs will be modulationally stable, and may propagate in
the form of dark/grey envelope excitations (hole solitons or voids; see Fig. 4a,b). On the other hand, for k > kcr,
modulational instability may lead to the formation of bright (pulse) envelope solitons (see Fig. 4c). Analytical
expressions for these excitations can be found in [7].

It may be noted that the modulation of transverse dust grain oscillations clearly appears in numerical simulations

[13]; see e.g Fig. 3.

IV. LONGITUDINAL SOLITONS.

Equation (8) is identical to the equation of motion in an atomic chain with anharmonic springs, i.e.

in the
celebrated FPU (Fermi-Pasta-Ulam) problem. Inspired by methods of solid state physics, one may opt for a continuum
description at a ﬁrst step, viz. δxn(t) → u(x, t). This may lead to diﬀerent nonlinear evolution equations (depending
on simplifying assumptions), some of which are critically discussed in [9]. What follows is a summary of the lengthy
analysis carried out therein.

Keeping lowest order nonlinear and dispersive terms, the continuum variable u obeys [10]:

¨u + ν ˙u − c2

L uxx −

0 uxxxx = − p0 ux uxx + q0 (ux)2 uxx ,
r2

c2
L
12

where (·)x ≡ ∂(·)/∂x; cL = ωL,0 r0; p0 and q0 were deﬁned above. Assuming near-sonic propagation (i.e. v ≈ cL),
and deﬁning the relative displacement w = ux, one has

wτ − a w wζ + ˆa w2 wζ + b wζζζ = 0

(for ν = 0), where a = p0/(2cL) > 0, ˆa = q0/(2cL) > 0, and b = cLr2
0/24 > 0. Since the original work of Melandsø
[4], various studies have relied on the Korteweg - deVries (KdV) equation, i.e. Eq. (13) for ˆa = 0, in order to gain
analytical insight in the compressive structures observed in experiments [1]. Indeed, the KdV Eq. possesses negative
(only, here, since a > 0) supersonic pulse soliton solutions for w, implying a compressive (anti-kink) excitation for

5

u; the KdV soliton is thus interpreted as a density variation in the crystal, viz. n(x, t)/n0 ∼ −∂u/∂x ≡ −w. Also,
the pulse width L0 and height u0 satisfy u0L2
0 = cst., a feature which is conﬁrmed by experiments [1]. Now, here’s a
crucial point to be made (among others [9]): in a Debye crystal, ˆa ≈ 2a roughly (for κ ≈ 1), so the KdV approximation
(i.e. assuming ˆa ≈ 0) is not valid. Instead, one may employ the extended KdV Eq. (eKdV) (13), which accounts for
both compressive and rarefactive lattice excitations (see expressions in [9]; also cf. Fig. 4).
Alternatively, Eq. (12) can be reduced to a Generalized Boussinesq (GBq) Equation

¨w − v2

0 wxx = h wxxxx + p (w2)xx + q (w3)xx

(14)

(w = ux; p = −p0/2 < 0, q = q0/3 > 0); again, for q ∼ q0 = 0, one recovers a Boussinesq (Bq) equation, e.g. widely
studied in solid chains. As physically expected, the GBq (Bq) equation yields, like its eKdV (KdV) counterpart, both
compressive and rarefactive (only compressive) solutions; however, the (supersonic) propagation speed v now does
not have to be close to cL. A detailed comparative study of (and exact expressions for) all of these soliton excitations

V. CONCLUSIONS.

Concluding, we have reviewed recent results on nonlinear excitations (solitary waves) occurring in a (1d) dust
mono-layer. Modulated envelope TDL and LDL structures occur, due to sheath and coupling nonlinearity. Both
compressive and rarefactive longitudinal excitations are predicted and may be observed by appropriate experiments.

Collisionless Damping of Low-Frequency Magnetosonic Pulses in a

Two-Ion-Species Plasma

(Received January 10, 2014)

Low-frequency mangnetosonic pulses in a two-ion-species plasma are studied theoretically and
by simulation with a one-dimensional electromagnetic simulation code based on a three-ﬂuid

model, with particular attention to the dynamics of minority heavy ions.
It is found that
heavy ions can gain some energy from the pulses. Because of this energy transfer, the pulses

are damped even if the plasma is collisionless and pulse propagation is perpendicular to the

magnetic ﬁeld.

KEYWORDS: collisionless damping, magnetosonic wave, two-ion-species plasma, energy dissipation, soliton

The presence of multiple ion species introduces many interesting eﬀects to linear and nonlinear
magnetosonic waves.1−9) First, the magnetosonic wave in a two-ion-species plasma is split into two
modes: the high- and low-frequency modes.1) The frequency of the low-frequency mode tends to

zero as the wave number k tends to zero and approaches the ion-ion hybrid resonance frequency as
k → ∞.8) The high-frequency mode has a cut-oﬀ frequency on the order of ion cyclotron frequency

and has a resonance frequency on the order of the lower hybrid frequency. (The dispersion curves

can be found in ref .1). It was found that the nonlinear behavior of these modes are both described

by the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, even though their dispersion curves are quite diﬀerent
in the long-wavelength region.1) The characteristic soliton widths are the electron skin depth for

the high-frequency mode and the ion skin depth for the low-frequency mode.

In a collisionless, single-ion-species plasma, small-amplitude magnetosonic waves propagating
perpendicular to a magnetic ﬁeld are not damped.10, 11) (Large-amplitude waves can be damped,
because they accelerate a fraction of the ions by the electrostatic ﬁeld. 12−15)) It was reported in
refs. 4 and 5, however, that a nonlinear pulse of the high-frequency mode is damped in a multi-

ion-species plasma. (Here, light ions are assumed to be the main component, as in space plasmas.)

The damping is due to the energy transfer to heavy ions. That is, the transverse electric ﬁeld in
a high-frequency-mode pulse can accelerate heavy ions in the direction parallel to the wavefront.3)

Thus the kinetic energy of heavy ions is increased behind the pulse. This could be an important

1

dissipation mechanism in a collisionless multi-ion-species plasma such as the solar corona.

In this letter, we will show that the low-frequency mode pulse can also impart some energy to

heavy ions in the same way. Hence the pulse can be damped. An important diﬀerence is, however,

that the heavy ions can suﬀer cyclotron oscillation a few times while they are in the pulse region,
because the soliton width of the low-frequency mode is quite large, about (mi/me)1/2 times as large
as that of the high-frequency mode, where mi is the ion mass and me is the electron mass. The

heavy ions therefore alternately gain and lose energies in the pulse region. Here, we will obtain

the net change in the kinetic energy of the heavy ions and study the wave damping due to this

mechanism. First, we will analytically discuss the heavy-ion motion in the low-frequency mode

pulse. It is found that heavy ions can be slightly accelerated by the pulse. Next, using a simulation

based on a three-ﬂuid model, we will show that the low-frequency-mode pulse imparts some energy

to heavy ions as theoretically predicted. Therefore, the pulse is gradually damped.

We consider magnetosonic waves propagating perpendicular to a magnetic ﬁeld in a plasma

containing two ion species; they are denoted by a and b, and the ion cyclotron frequency of ions

b is assumed to be lower than that of a (Ωb < Ωa). In a two-ion-species plasma, the dispersion
relation of the low-frequency mode is given by

in the long-wavelength region. Here vp0 is deﬁned as

When two ion species are present at considerable densities, the ﬁrst term in the square brackets,

depth, c/ωpi. The dispersion of the low-frequency mode is ∼ (mi/me) times as large as that of the
magnetosonic wave in a single-ion-species plasma.9) In the limit of nb0 → 0, the ﬁrst and second

We note that the relation Ey − vxBz/c = 0 holds for both ions and electrons in nonlinear mag-
netosonic waves in a single-ion-species plasma.16, 17) Thus Ey does not accelerate ions in such a
case. The KdV theory for the low-frequency mode also gives the relation vbx = cEy/B0 among the
lowest-order perturbations.1) The discussion in ref. 3, however, shows that this relation can easily

break down for heavy ions. Here we calculate, more accurately, the heavy-ion motion, including

inertial eﬀects, and examine if the heavy ions can gain energies.

We integrate eqs. (13) and (14) over time, assuming that the initial particle velocity is zero,

vbx(0) = vby(0) = 0, and the initial particle position is in the far upstream region, x(0) ≡ x0 ≫ D.

We disregard the perturbation of the magnetic ﬁeld and approximate the variable x in Ex and Ey

as x = x0. We take the time derivative of eq. (14) and eliminate vbx using eq. (13), and obtain

Equation (19) indicates that heavy ions gyrate with the speed vbm in the downstream region. Thus,

heavy ions have ﬁnite speed vbm behind the pulse, even though their initial speed was assumed to
be zero.

Figure 1 shows vbm as a function of the wave amplitude Bn in a hydrogen-helium plasma where
the mass and charge ratios are mb/ma = 4 and qb/qa = 2, respectively. The solid line is for the
plasma with the density ratio nb/na = 0.1 and the dotted line is for the plasma with nb/na = 0.05.

The speed vbm increases with the wave amplitude Bn and decreases with the density ratio nb/na.

eq. (22) is reduced to the one derived in the previous paper, eq. (A.14) in ref. 3.

Equation (19) gives vby(t) in the far downstream region. To observe the time variation of vby
in and outside the pulse region, we numerically integrated eqs. (13) and (14), substituting the

low-frequency-mode pulse given by eqs.

(8)-(12). The amplitude of the pulse was taken to be

Bn = 0.03. Figure 2 shows the time variation of vby thus obtained. When a heavy ion enters the

pulse at time Ωbt = 15, vby starts to increase. Because the Lorentz force converts vby to vbx, vby
decreases after reaching the maximum value. At about Ωbt = 25, the particle goes out of the pulse
and starts to gyrate with the speed vbm = 6.0 × 10−3vA.

Next, we discuss the energy change of a heavy-ion particle,

The energy gain from the longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ex is negative, and that from the transverse

electric ﬁeld Ey is positive. Hence, the heavy ions obtain energies from the transverse electric ﬁeld.

The net change in the energy is

∆Eb = mbv2

bm/2.

It is thus expected that the pulse of the low-frequency mode is damped due to this energy transfer.

Let us now study the propagation of the low-frequency mode using a one-dimensional, fully

electromagnetic code based on the three-ﬂuid model:

conﬁrmed that solitary pulses are not damped in a single-ion-species plasma (nb = 0). We then

simulated a hydrogen-helium plasma and chose the hydrogen-to-electron mass ratio as ma/me =

1000. The density ratio was nb/na = 0.1, and the magnetic ﬁeld strength was |Ωe|/ωpe = 0.5, so
that c/vA = 68.3.

Fig. 3. Proﬁles of the magnetic ﬁeld, light-ion velocity vay, and heavy-ion velocity vby at Ωbt = 25. The initial

amplitude is Bn = 0.03.

In Fig. 3 we show proﬁles of the magnetic ﬁeld, light-ion (H) velocity vay, and heavy-ion (He)

velocity vby at time Ωbt = 25. The magnetic ﬁeld and velocities are normalized by B0 and vA,

respectively. At time t = 0, the amplitude was Bn(0) = 0.03, and the center of the pulse was

at x/(c/ωpe) ≃ 1100. Figure 3 shows that the heavy ions have a ﬁnite speed behind the pulse,

as predicted by eq.
(19) and Fig. 2. This heavy-ion motion produces perturbations of other
components behind the pulse, 1000 <∼x/(c/ωpe) <∼2300, which can be seen in the proﬁles of vay and

7

Bz; even in the proﬁle of Bz, we notice small-amplitude perturbations behind the main pulse.

The observed heavy-ion speed vbm, 2.2 × 10−3vA, is smaller than the theoretical value given by
eq. (20), vbm = 7.7× 10−3vA. In deriving eq. (20), we have not included the eﬀect of the generation
of hydromagnetic perturbations behind the pulse. Therefore, eq. (20) is interpreted to give the

upper limit of the velocity of accelerated heavy ions.

Figure 4 shows the time variation of the wave energy Ew(t) of the main pulse. Even though we

observe small-amplitude ﬂuctuation, the main pulse certainly loses energy gradually.

In summary, the propagation of the low-frequency magnetosonic pulses in a two-ion-species

plasma was studied theoretically and by simulation with a one-dimensional electromagnetic code

based on the three-ﬂuid model. First, the heavy-ion motion in the nonlinear pulse of the low-

frequency mode was theoretically discussed. It was found that heavy ions gain some energy from

the transverse electric ﬁeld formed in the pulse. Next, using the simulation, we showed that the

solitary pulse of the low-frequency mode is gradually damped.

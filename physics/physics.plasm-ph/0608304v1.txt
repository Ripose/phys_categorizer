The eigenmode spectrum is a fundamental starting point for the analysis of plasma stability and
the onset of turbulence, but the characterization of the spectrum even for the simplest plasma
model, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), is not fully understood. This is especially true in
conﬁgurations with no continuous geometric symmetry, such as a real tokamak when the discrete
nature of the external magnetic ﬁeld coils is taken into account, or the alternative fusion concept,
the stellarator, where axisymmetry is deliberately broken to provide a nonzero winding number
(rotational transform) on each invariant torus of the magnetic ﬁeld line dynamics (assumed for
present purposes to be an integrable Hamiltonian system).

Quantum (wave) chaos theory provides tools for characterizing the spectrum statistically, from
the regular spectrum of the separable case (integrable semiclassical dynamics) to that where the
semiclassical ray dynamics is so chaotic that no simple classiﬁcation of the individual eigenvalues is
possible (quantum chaos).

The MHD spectrum exhibits certain nongeneric properties, which we show, using a toy model,
to be understable from the number-theoretic properties of the asymptotic spectrum in the limit of
large toroidal and poloidal mode (quantum) numbers when only a single radial mode number is
retained.

Much more realistically, using the ideal MHD code CAS3D, we have constructed a data set of
several hundred growth-rate eigenvalues for an interchange-unstable three-dimensional stellarator
equilibrium with a rather ﬂat, nonmonotonic rotational transform proﬁle. Statistical analysis of
eigenvalue spacings shows evidence of generic quantum chaos, which we attribute to the mixing
eﬀect of having a large number of radial mode numbers.

INTRODUCTION

The tokamak and stellarator fusion concepts both seek
to contain a plasma in a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, but to
a good approximation the tokamak ﬁeld is axisymmet-
ric. Thus the study of the spectrum of normal modes
of small oscillations about equilibrium is simpliﬁed by
the existence of an ignorable coordinate. The stellarator
class of device, on the other hand, is inherently nonax-
isymmetric and the lack of a continuous symmetry means

∗Electronic address: robert.dewar@anu.edu.au

there are no “good quantum numbers” to characterise the
spectrum.

This makes the numerical computation of the spectrum
a challenging task, but numerical matrix eigenvalue pro-
grams, such as the three-dimensional TERPSICHORE
[1] and CAS3D [2] codes, are routinely used to assess
the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability of pro-
posed fusion-relevant experiments. An example is the
design of the 5-fold-symmetric Wendelstein 7-X (W7–X)
stellarator, where CAS3D was used [3] to study a number
of diﬀerent cases.

The conﬁgurations foreseen to be studied experimen-
tally in W7-X are MHD stable, but in the present paper
we are concerned with an unstable case from this study, a
high-mirror-ratio, high-rotational transform equilibrium

FIG. 1: Left: plasma boundary of a 5-periodic toroidal
equilibrium geometrically related to W7–X conﬁgurations (at
hβi = 0.05, VMEC calculation). Right three frames: vertical
cross-sections of the conﬁguration at three diﬀerent toroidal
angles within a ﬁeld period, with Z the vertical coordinate
and R the distance from the Z axis. The plasma boundary
has been scaled such that the minor radius of the torus a ≈ 1
and the major radius equals the aspect ratio R/a = A.

(Fig. 1). Due to its less pronounced shaping this case
is quite unstable, which contrasts with the properties of
genuine W7-X conﬁgurations. The three-dimensional na-
ture of the equilibrium breaks all continuous symmetries,
coupling both poloidal (m) and toroidal (n) Fourier har-
monics and thus precluding separation of variables and
simple classiﬁcation of the eigenvalues.

These eigenvalues, ω2 ≡ −γ2, are real due to the
self-adjointness [4] of the linearized force and kinetic en-
ergy operators in ideal MHD linearized about a static
equilibrium. This is analogous to the Hermitian nature
of quantum mechanics, so we might a priori expect to
be able to take over mathematical techniques used in
quantum mechanics. Thus we study the W7–X Mercier
(interchange)-unstable case mentioned above using sta-
tistical techniques from the theory of quantum chaos [5,
eg].

This is of practical importance for numerical analysis
of the convergence of eigenvalue codes because, if the sys-
tem is quantum-chaotic, convergence of individual eigen-
values cannot be expected and a statistical description
must be used. However, there is a fundamental question
as to whether the ideal MHD spectrum lies in the same
universality class as typical quantum mechanics cases.

This question has been addressed recently [6, 7] by
studying the interchange unstable spectrum in an eﬀec-
tively cylindrical model of a stellarator. In the cylindrical
case the eigenvalue problem is separable into three one-
dimensional eigenvalue problems, with radial, poloidal,
and toroidal (axial) quantum numbers l, m, and n, re-
spectively. If the spectrum falls within the generic quan-
tum chaos theory universality class for integrable, non-
chaotic systems [8] then the probability distribution func-
tion for the separation of neighboring eigenvalues is a
Poisson distribution.

However, this work indicates that the universality class
depends on the method of regularization (ie truncation
of the countably inﬁnite set of ideal-MHD interchange
growth rates): a smooth, physically-motivated ﬁnite-
Larmor-radius roll-oﬀ in the spectrum appears to give
the generic Poisson statistics for separable systems, but

a sharp truncation in m and n gives highly non-generic
statistics. The latter case is less physical, but corre-
sponds closely to the practice in MHD eigenvalue studies
of using a restricted m, n basis set but a relatively ﬁne
mesh in the radial direction.

A careful analysis of the spectrum of ideal-MHD in-
terchange modes in a separable cylindrical approxima-
tion [7] revealed non-generic behaviour of the spectral
statistics—a bimodal PDF, rather than the expected
Poisson distribution. The non-genericity of this separa-
ble case indicates that caution must be applied in apply-
ing conventional quantum chaos theory in non-separable
geometries.

The study [7] indicated that the non-generic behaviour
of ideal-MHD interchange modes was due to the peculiar
feature of the dispersion relation for these modes that the
eigenvalues in the short-wavelength limit depend only on
the direction of the wave vector, not on its magnitude.
(This is unusual behaviour, but it is shared with inter-
nal gravity waves in geophysical ﬂuid dynamics.) It was
suggested in [7] that the detailed features of the spec-
trum could be understood from the properties of Farey
sequences.

In the present paper we discuss ﬁctitious eigenvalues
from a toy model, used to elucidate the importance of
number-theoretic eﬀects, that illustrate how nongeneric
the MHD eigenvalue spectrum can be if only one radial
eigenmode is used. Then we present the results of the
quantum chaos analysis of the W7–X case.

II. TOY EIGENVALUE PROBLEM

To gain insight into the nongeneric behavior found in
the separable case [7] with only one radial eigenmode we
study the energy spectrum {En,m} for a “toy” quantum
mechanical Hamiltonian H = pφ/pθ where the conﬁgu-
ration space is the 2-torus θ ∈ [0, 2π), φ ∈ [0, 2π) with
periodic boundary conditions.
In the semiclassical ap-
proximation we see that H depends only on the direction
of p, not its magnitude, as for MHD interchange modes
and internal gravity waves.

The eigenvalue problem is

the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation, Hψ = Eψ, the eigenfunctions be-
ing exp[i(mθ + nφ)]/4π2, where m and n are integers.
The eigenvalues En,m = n/m (m 6= 0).

Note the singular nature of the spectrum—it is dis-
crete, yet inﬁnitely dense, the rationals being dense on
the real line. Also, the spectrum is inﬁnitely degenerate
as eigenvalues are repeated whenever m and n have a
common factor. Mathematically such a spectrum, nei-
ther point nor continuous, belongs to the essential spec-
trum [9].

In order to analyze this spectrum using standard quan-
tum chaos techniques we ﬁrst regularize it by bounding
the region of the m, n lattice studied, and then allowing
the bound to increase indeﬁnitely. Fortunately the PDF
P (s) is independent of the precise shape of the bounding
line when we follow standard practice [5] in renormalizing
(unfolding) the energy levels to make the average spac-
ing unity. Thus we adopt the simplest choice, taking the
bounded region to be the triangle 0 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ mmax.
As the points (n, m) form a lattice in the plane with mean
areal density of 1, we can estimate the asymptotic, large-
mmax behaviour of the number of levels, Nmax, from the
area of the bounding triangle: the m axis, the line n = m
and the line m = 1, which gives the “Weyl formula” [5]
Nmax ∼ m2

max/2.

The Farey sequence F (Q) is the set of all rational num-
bers p/q between 0 and 1, 1 < q ≤ Q, arranged in order
of increasing arithmetic size and keeping only mutually
prime pairs of integers p and q. Farey sequences are im-
portant in number theory [10] and have application in
various dynamical systems problems, such as the the-
ory of mode locking in circle maps [11]. They even have
a connection with the famous Riemann hypothesis [12].
They are conveniently generated using the Mathematica
algorithm [13]

Farey[Q_] := Union[{0,1},

Flatten[Table[p/q,{q, Q},{p, q-1}]]].

The list G(mmax) ≡ {En,m}, sorted into a non-
decreasing sequence {Ei|i = 1, 2, . . . , Nmax} is very sim-
ilar to the Farey sequence F (mmax) except for the high
degeneracy (multiplicity) of numerically identical levels,
especially when n/m is a low-order rational.

Deﬁne the renormalized (unfolded) energy as En,m ≡
NmaxEn,m. The normalization by Nmmax ensures that
ENmax = Nmax, so the mean slope of the Devil’s staircase
shown in Fig. 2(a) is unity. The large vertical steps visible
in Fig. 2(a) are due to the high degeneracy at low-order
rational values of n/m.

This high degeneracy is also the cause of the delta
function spike at the origin visible in the level-separation
probability distribution plot shown in Fig. 3(a), which is
very similar to Fig. 9(a) in [7].

A. Farey statistics

The tail in Fig. 3(a) is due to the non-degenerate com-
ponent of the spectrum, obtained by reducing all frac-
tions p/q to lowest terms and deleting duplications. Thus

is for the Poisson Process of the generic integrable problem
and the long-dashed curve is that for the Gaussian orthogonal
ensemble of random matrices (quantum chaotic case).

the eigenvalues in this set are NQ times the terms of the
Farey sequence F (Q).

To study the statistics of this non-degenerate compo-
nent it is natural to deﬁne the Farey spectrum {EF
i } as
N F(Q) times the terms of the Farey sequence F (Q),
where N F(Q) is the number of terms in F (Q). The
asymptotic behaviour of N F(Q) in the large-n limit is
given [14, p. 391] by N F(Q) ∼ 3Q2/π2 + O(Q ln Q).
The staircase plot and separation distribution P F(s) for
the Farey spectrum are given in Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 3(b),
respectively.

It is a standard result in the theory of Farey se-
quences [10, p. 301] that the smallest and largest nearest-
neighbour spacings in F (Q) are given respectively by

in Fig. 3(a) to the strength of the delta function Fig. 3(a)
is N F(Q)/[N (Q) − N F(Q)] ≈ 1.55.

We have veriﬁed that the probability distributions re-
main unchanged if subranges of the spectra are used, in
agreement with the result included in Theorem 1.1 of [12]
that the convergence to a probability measure is indepen-
dent of the interval chosen.

III. W7–X RESULTS

The W7–X variant equilibrium studied was generated
with the VMEC [15] code, which assumes the magnetic
ﬁeld to be integrable, so that all magnetic ﬁeld lines lie on
nested toroidal ﬂux surfaces, which we label by s, the en-
closed toroidal magnetic ﬂux divided by the toroidal ﬂux
enclosed by the plasma boundary. The magnetic ﬁeld is
characterized on each ﬂux surface by its winding number
ι-(s).
(In tokamaks its inverse, q ≡ 1/ι-, is more com-
monly used.) As seen in Fig. 4 the rotational transform
proﬁle is nonmonotonic and has low shear (ι-axis = 1.1066,
ι-min = 1.0491, ι-edge = 1.0754) so it is close to, but
greater than, unity over the whole plasma. It is also seen
from Fig. 4 equilibrium is interchange unstable, because
the Mercier stability criterion is violated over the whole
plasma.

The CAS3D code expands the eigenfunctions in a ﬁ-
nite Fourier basis in the toroidal and poloidal angles, se-
lected so as to include all |n| ≤ nmax and all m such that
n/m lies in a band including the range of ι-. The Fourier
tableau is depicted graphically in Fig. 5. In this code, the
radial dependence of the perturbation functions is treated
by a hybrid Finite-Element approach, using a linear in-

FIG. 8: Unfolded eigenvalue spacing distributions for mode
family N = 1, calculated using two diﬀerent unfolding meth-
ods. The results are seen to be consistent to within statistical
error.

We characterize the statistics of the ensembles of eigen-
values within the three mode families using two standard
measures from quantum chaos theory [5, 16, 17], ﬁrst
renormalizing (“unfolding”) the eigenvalues so their av-
erage separation is unity. The ﬁrst measure, shown in
Fig. 6, is the probability distribution function P (x) for
the eigenvalue separation x. The other, shown in Fig. 7,
is the Dyson–Mehta rigidity ∆3(L), where L is the sub-
range of unfolded eigenvalues used.

As seen from Fig. 6, when the statistics are analyzed
within the three mode families the eigenvalue spacing dis-
tribution function is closer to the Wigner conjecture form
found for generic chaotic systems [5] than to the Poisson
distribution for separable systems, as might be expected
from [18]. However, when the spectra from the three
uncoupled mode familes are combined, there are enough
accidental degeneracies that the spacing distribution be-
comes close to Poissonian.

To test the sensitivity to the precise method of un-
folding chosen, we did the statistics using two diﬀerent
methods. They are the Gaussian unfolding [17] and a ﬁt
with exponentials. The results, shown in Fig. 8, indicate
little sensitivity to unfolding method.

IV. CONCLUSION

5

Although not presented here, when all unstable eigen-
modes (i.e. all l, m, and n) are included, the eigenvalue
spacing statistics for the ideal-MHD interchange eigen-
value spectrum in a separable cylindrical approximation
is close to that of generic separable wave equations [8],
despite our earlier ﬁnding [6, 7] that the spectrum in the
subspace of the most unstable radial eigenmode l = 0
is nongeneric, as explained by the model presented in
Sec. II.

In this paper we have shown that a strongly three-
dimensional stellarator equilibrium related to W7-X,
the unstable interchange (Mercier) mode spectrum has,
to within statistical uncertainties, similar statistics to
generic quantum chaotic systems. That is, the over-
whelming majority of eigenvalues are not “good quantum
numbers” and can thus be expected to display sensitivity
to small perturbations. This needs to be borne in mind
when doing convergence studies using stability codes such
as CAS3D.

An interesting question for further work is whether
other modes, such as drift waves, are quantum chaotic
in stellarators, or if this is a pecularity of MHD modes.
There is already evidence that kinetic eﬀects make the
semiclassical (WKB) dynamics closer to integrable [19].
Another question is whether quantum chaos of Mercier
modes occurs in machines with more ﬁeld periods than
the 5 of W7-X. Earlier work [20] suggested that, in a
10-ﬁeld-period heliotron equilibrium related to the Large
Helical Device (LHD), the spectrum is close to that of
an equivalent axisymmetric torus, and thus not chaotic.
However, a relatively few modes were studied and the
spacing statistics were not calculated.

Three-dimensional (3D) hybrid PIC simulations are presented to study electron energy transport
and deposition in a full-scale fast ignition conﬁguration. Multi-prong core heating close to ignition
is found when a few GA, few PW beam is injected. Resistive beam ﬁlamentation in the corona seeds
the 3D current pattern that penetrates the core. Ohmic heating is important in the low-density
corona, while classical Coulomb deposition heats the core. Here highest energy densities (few Tbar
at 10 keV) are observed at densities above 200 g/cm3. Energy coupling to the core ranges from 20
to 30%; it is enhanced by beam collimation and decreases when raising the beam particle energy
from 1.5 to 5.5 MeV.

Fast ignition of

fusion targets [1] oﬀers a
promising alternative to the standard scheme of central
hot spot ignition [2, 3]. Separating fuel compression
from hot spot heating is expected to reduce compression
and symmetry requirements signiﬁcantly. Here we study
Tabak’s original proposal [1] to use a laser-driven electron
beam to ignite the compressed core. Atzeni [3, 4] esti-
mates that an energy of about 20 kJ is required to ignite
300 g/cm3 Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel when deposited
in 20 ps on a 20 µm spot with 0.6 g/cm2 stopping range.
This implies a giga-ampere (GA), peta-watt (PW) pulse
of 1 MeV electrons. Little cones may be used to gener-
ate such beams and to guide them through the plasma
corona [5, 6]. Recent experiments on cone guiding with
300 J, 0.5 PW laser pulses have demonstrated excellent
(20 -30%) energy coupling from laser to core [5]. For
full-scale fast ignition, a 100 kJ, multi-PW beam is re-
quired. It will carry a few GA current, 104 times larger
than the Alfv´en current that limits transport in vacuum
due to magnetic self-interaction. Here the beam has to
be transported over a distance of 100 - 200 µm between
cone tip and core through a high-gradient plasma proﬁle.
This is the topic of the present paper.

In plasma, the beam current is compensated by return
currents, which suppress the magnetic ﬁelds. But this
beam is subject to ﬁlamentation instability. For colli-
sionless plasma, linear growth rates have been studied in
[7, 8], and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation was used to
trace the nonlinear evolution [9, 10]. For compressed fast
ignition plasmas, full-scale PIC simulations are not yet
feasible. They should include collisions and plasma resis-
tivity to properly describe the return currents. Here we
use a hybrid model of remarkable simplicity and adequate
for describing self-magnetized transport in high-density
fuel. It treats only the relativistic beam electrons by PIC
and models the background plasma by the return current
density jr, tied to the electric ﬁeld E=ηjr by Ohm’s law

with resistivity η. Maxwell’s equations are used in the
form ∇×B=µ0j and ∇×E=−∂B/∂t, where j=jb+jr is
the sum of beam and return current density. The beam
deposits energy into plasma electrons in two ways: by
direct classical Coulomb deposition and via return cur-
rent ohmic heating with power density ηj2
r . Electrons
and ions are coupled by thermal energy transfer and oth-
erwise form a neutral, ﬁxed density distribution. Charge
separation ﬁelds can be neglected, since in this high-
density environment Debye lengths are in the order of
nanometer, much smaller than the micrometer scales of
resistive ﬁlamentation. This model was proposed by Bell
[11] and further developed by Davies [12] and Gremil-
let et al. [13]. First three-dimensional (3D) simulations
based on this model were published in [13], showing 3D
resistive ﬁlamentation. Gremillet et al. also derived the
linear growth rates, now depending on resistivity η. The
present version of the model is described in more detail
in [14].

Recently two-dimensional simulations of the cone-
guided target experiment [5] were published by Camp-
bell et al. [15] and Mason [16]. Based on diﬀerent hybrid
codes, they could reproduce the measured core heating
of 800 eV. Using the present model, we have obtained
similar 2D results [17]; comparisons with the linear the-
ory of the resistive ﬁlamentation instability are found in
[18]. Here we present ﬁrst three-dimensional simulations
of electron transport and deposition in the high-density
part of a fast ignition target. It is shown how 3D beam ﬁl-
amentation seeded in the corona leads to multi-hot-spot
heating of the core close to DT ignition. The present
study is motivated by the next generation of high-power
facilities to demonstrate fast ignition [19, 20].

Simulation parameters. The simulated conﬁguration
is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of 0.2 mg DT fuel com-
pressed into a spherical blob of 400 g/cm3 peak density
and 75 µm diameter; it sits on a density pedestal of 1.5

g/cm3 (the halo). A beam of fast electrons is injected
from the right at z = 0. We imagine that it emerges
from the tip of a cone at this position. The cone itself
and the laser pulse generating the beam inside the cone
are not simulated here. We rather model the injected
beam in form of a directed electron distribution, taking
a Gaussian in radius and time. It is centered at 7 ps with
10 ps duration and has a spot diameter of 40 µm, both
at full width half maximum (FWHM). The pulse has a
power of 6 PW and a total energy of 60 kJ (30 kJ within
FWHM). A half-angle of 22.5◦ is chosen for the initial
beam divergence, consistent with the cone experiment
[5] and the simulations in [15, 16]. Electrons with energy
E = (γ − 1)mec2 are injected with a randomly chosen
half-angle between 0 and tan−1[hp2/(γ − 1)], where the
parameter h is used to adjust the overall opening angle of
the beam. A relativistic Maxwell distribution with tem-
perature Tb ≈ f · mec2 [(1 + Iλ2/13.7 GW)1/2 − 1] is used
to describe the energy spectrum, obtained for local laser
intensity I and wavelength λ. PIC simulations [21] give
front factors f ≈ 1 − 3, depending on the scale-length of
the plasma in which the electrons are accelerated. For
cone-guided fast ignition with 10 ps pulse durations, the
factor is expected to be larger than f ≈ 1 which applies
to sharp surfaces. Here we consider diﬀerent cases with
mean electron kinetic energies (averaged over the FWHM
of the distributions in radius and time) in the range of
hEi=1.5 - 5.5 MeV; 2.5 MeV is taken as a reference value.
The main parameters of the imploded fuel conﬁgu-
ration, the peak density of 400 g/cm3, the distance of
150 µm from cone tip, and the initial plasma tempera-
ture, have been adapted from implosion simulations of
cone targets with the code SARA-2D [22]. They will be
published separately. The plasma resistivity depends on
the temperature distribution. The SARA-2D simulations
indicate temperatures in the range of 300 eV to 1 keV.
For simplicity, a uniform initial DT temperature of 500
eV is taken here, which sets the initial resistivity to a
level of 10−8 Ωm. Concerning the numerical parameters,
we have chosen a cell width of 1 µm in each coordinate,
a time step of 3 fs, and a total number of 2 × 107 par-
ticles, injected over the time interval of 0 - 14 ps. Free

cal Spitzer resistivity is chosen for the DT plasma, and
MPQeos tables [23] are used to compute electron and ion
temperatures from the deposited energy.

Results.

In Fig. 2(a) it is seen that the injected 3.5
GA current decays into ﬁlaments after a propagation dis-
tance of z = 70 µm. Actually we ﬁnd that the ﬁlaments
start to grow in the halo region (z < 50 µm) and are
then strongly ampliﬁed in the density slopes of the blob.
They are consistent with growth rates obtained from lin-
ear theory and correspond to the current ﬁlaments shown
in the perpendicular cut of Fig. 2(b). Beam ﬁlamentation
depends on resistivity and therefore on electron temper-
ature Te. In the lower density region, ohmic heating and
Coulomb energy deposition lead to high electron temper-
atures of Te ≈ 20 − 100 keV, much higher than the ion
temperature Ti, and here magnetic ﬁelds saturate at lev-
els of 100 T due to low resistivity. At higher densities
(z > 70 µm), suﬃcient energy transfer from electrons to
ions takes place, and we ﬁnd Te ≈ Ti ≤ 20 keV. The cor-
responding ion temperature is plotted in Fig. 3(a). Here
higher resistivity leads to B-ﬁeld of ≈ 1 kT and enhanced
ﬁlament growth. We ﬁnd that both temperatures and
B-ﬁelds are well described by the analytic scaling laws
derived by Bell and Kingham [24]. We have also checked
that ﬁlamentation persists for initial temperatures of 1
keV and halo densities up to 10 g/cm3, but disappears
for beam kinetic energies hEi > 4.5 MeV.

The ﬁlaments shown in Fig. 2(b) carry about 10 MA
beam current each. This beam current is almost com-
pletely compensated by the plasma return current, im-
plying jr ≈ −jb; the net current of a ﬁlament is only
about 10 kA, consistent with the magnetic ﬁeld strengths
of 1 kT observed in Fig. 2(a). It is worthwhile empha-
sizing that the ﬁlamented current distribution heats elec-
trons signiﬁcantly more than a uniform current distribu-
tion of same total current because of the j2
r dependence
of ohmic heating. This is how ﬁlamentation leads to en-

(see page 85 in [3]) can be written in compact form as
phRh > 45(ρh/ρc)1/2 Tbarµm, where index h refers to
hot fuel and index c to surrounding cold fuel. This con-
dition combines the threshold values for ρhRh and Th and
holds for temperatures 5 < Th/keV< 15. From Figs. 3(a)
and (b), we ﬁnd for the central hot spot 2phRh ≈ 50
Tbar µm in longitudinal direction.
In transverse direc-
tion, it is 2phRh ≈ 20 Tbar µm, but here a number of
neighboring hot spots will cooperate and 2pcRc ≈ 50
Tbar µm, obtained from pc = 1 Tbar and 2Rc = 50 µm,
may serve as an estimate. We conclude that the refer-
ence case shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is close to ignition. It
should be understood that the core heating is almost ex-
clusively due to Coulomb deposition of beam electrons.
Ohmic heating by return currents dominates in the halo,
but plays only a minor role for the overall energy balance.
Beam-generated ﬁelds turn out to contribute to the core
heating indirectly, mediated by ﬁlamentation and colli-
mation eﬀects. Beam collimation is observed in Fig. 3(a)
when compared with Fig. 3(c).

Figure 5 shows what fractions of the injected beam
energy are deposited in diﬀerent parts of the target. The
total deposition, given versus beam kinetic energy hEi,
drops from 90% to 40%, when raising hEi from 1.5 to 5.5
MeV. Most of the deposition is due to classical Coulomb
collisions, consistent with the areal density of 2.9 g/cm2
along the axis. Notice that the other part of the energy is
not deposited at all, but passes through the target and is
lost. Clearly this makes average beam energies beyond 5
MeV prohibitive. The very important partition between
deposition into high density core and low-density zones
with ρ < 200 g/cm3 is also shown in Fig. 5. We ﬁnd that
the energy coupling to the core amounts to 30% at 1.5
MeV and 20% at 5 MeV. It is less sensitive to hEi than
the coupling into the lower density regions. Of course, the
core coupling strongly depends on the divergence angle
of the injected beam, which is therefore a key parameter
for fast ignition.
In the present simulations, the core
coupling eﬃciency degrades by 40%, when raising the
angle from 22.5◦ to 30◦. On the other hand, one should

hanced beam stopping within the present model. It dif-
fers from the strong anomalous stopping found in PIC
simulations [9, 10] for lower plasma densities (about 10×
beam density). Sentoku et al. have interpreted this stop-
ping as stochastic scattering of return current electrons
by magnetic perturbations |B| giving rise to an additional
eﬀective resistivity ηef f ≈ |B|/(enp). Even taking the
scaling |B| ∝ n
from [24], ηef f decreases with plasma
density np. For the parameters of the present simulation,
we ﬁnd ηef f to be always smaller than the Spitzer resis-
tivity. Therefore, we conclude that anomalous stopping
of this kind plays no signiﬁcant role here, in agreement
with the results of Mason [16].

Figures 3 and 4 present the central results of this pa-
per, showing DT fuel close to ignition. Notice that beam
ﬁlamentation in the corona is responsible for the frag-
mented heating pattern in the core. Artiﬁcial suppression
of the beam-generated ﬁelds (i.e. Coulomb deposition
only) would lead to smooth core heating with a maximum
temperature of 4 keV. This is shown in Figs. 3(c) and
(d), for comparison. With ﬁelds present, a multi-hot-spot
ignition region is formed in the high-density fuel with
maximum temperatures beyond 10 keV. The conjecture
here is that this will help ignition due to the nonlinear
scaling of fusion reactivities with temperature. Actually,
this needs to be conﬁrmed in more detailed simulations,
including hydrodynamics and fusion reaction physics in
3D geometry.

Here we give some estimates, based on the pressure
distribution shown in Fig. 4. The DT ignition condition

4

is close to ignition. More detailed simulations including
hydrodynamics and fusion heating are now in progress to
conﬁrm this point.

Concerning collective beam deposition, we ﬁnd, within
the physical model used here, that indeed beam ﬁla-
mentation enhances ohmic heating, because it depends
quadratically on the return current density jr. But this
additional deposition is not identical with the anoma-
lous stopping found in PIC simulations at lower densi-
ties. It also contributes little to the overall energy bal-
ance in the present simulation of fast ignition. Rather
the self-generated B-ﬁelds help by collimating the rela-
tivistic beam, and this improves the coupling eﬃciency
substantially.

notice that magnetic pinching of the beam improves core
coupling signiﬁcantly. Suppressing all beam-generated
ﬁelds in the simulations would lead to the dashed curves
in Fig. 5.

Estimating the laser-to-fast-electron conversion eﬃ-
ciency to be 50%, we ﬁnd a laser pulse energy of 100
- 150 kJ necessary to ignite a target. There may be pos-
sibilities to reduce this energy, e.g. by shortening the
distance between cone tip and blob or by careful design
of the cone to reduce beam divergence [25]. Certainly,
transport in the cone needs to be included in more com-
plete studies, in particular to account for the potential
barrier [16] and ﬁlamentation [26] at the cone tip.

In conclusion, the important message of this paper
concerning fast ignition of inertial fusion targets is that
a giga-ampere, multi-PW current can indeed be trans-
ported through the steep gradients of the plasma corona
toward the high-density fuel core. This is shown here for
the ﬁrst time in 3D geometry, using hybrid PIC simu-
lation. Central questions could be answered: Collective
magnetic eﬀects play a major role for core heating, but in
an indirect way. Resistive beam ﬁlamentation grows in
the low-density halo and seeds the 3D multi-prong beam,
which then penetrates the core. Of course, 3D simulation
is crucial in this context.

In the core, collective behavior is suppressed due the
large plasma-to-beam density ratio, and energy deposi-
tion takes place almost exclusively by classical Coulomb
collisions. We ﬁnd a fragmented hot spot conﬁguration,
and the fragmentation may actually help fuel ignition,
since concentrating the energy in a number of prongs
rather than heating the whole volume spanned by the
prongs leads to higher temperatures and therefore to
more heating by fusion products. The hpRi values ob-
tained for the reference case indeed indicate that this case

A fast and eﬃcient numerical-analytical approach is proposed for description
of complex behaviour in non-equilibrium ensembles in the BBGKY framework.
We construct the multiscale representation for hierarchy of partition functions by

1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

It is well known that fusion problem in plasma physics could be solved neither
experimentally nor theoretically during last ﬁfty years. At the same time, dur-
ing this long period other areas of physics and engineering demonstrated vast
growth, on the level of both theoretical understanding and practical smart real-
izability. We can only mention an unprecedent level of theoretical understanding
in Quantum Field Theory and String Physics, as the top of this mountain, and

solid state electronics penetrating in real life together with personal comput-
ers and a lot of related things. It should be mentioned that the former thing
demanded and created a fantastic level of theoretical models and new beatiful
mathematics while the latter depended only on the state of the art of engineers
from Intel and other high-tech ﬁrms who created, e.g., the processor Pentium
by means of the multiplication table (almost) only. Unfortunately, although
plasma physics, as a whole, was a key source of the so called Soliton Theory
(begining with numerical modeling by M. Kruskal and N. Zabusky), which was
very important part of Mathematical Physics during twenty-ﬁve years, it it-
self used no advantage of these methods and approaches and created nothing
comparable for a long time.

Because ﬁnancing contributions in this area deﬁnitely exceeds that of almost
all other areas of Physics, it seems that there are the serious obstacles which
prevent real progress in the problem of real fusion as the main subject in the area.
Of course, it may be a result of some unknown no-go theorem but it seems that
the current theoretical level deﬁnitely demonstrates that not all possibilities,
at least on the level of theoretical and matematical modeling, are exhausted.
Surely, it is more than clear that perturbations, linearization, PIC or MC do not
exhaust all instruments which we have at our hands on the route to theoretical
understanding and predictions. Deﬁnitely, we need much more to have inﬂuence
on almost free-of-theoretical-background work of experimentalists and engineers
who contribute to ITER and other related top level projects.

So, this paper and related ones can be considered as a small contribution to
an attempt to avoid the existing obstacles appeared on the main road of current
plasma physics.

Deﬁnitely, the ﬁrst thing which we need to change is a framework of generic
mathematical methods which can only improve the current state of the theory.
Although, as in case of Pentium processors, there is a chance that engineers
can solve all problems in a smart way without any theoretical contributions, but
the current status of out-of-Science problems is such one that, deﬁnetely, we have
no additional ﬁfty years to wait when the appearance of fusion machines leads
to total decreasing both the level of using of oil and the level of prices adequate
for civilized countries.

So, after pointing out our vision of well known situation in the area, we will
present some details of our attempts to change the standard approach [1], [2] to
more proper one from our point of view [3]-[8].
Our postulates (conjectures) are as follows:
A) The fusion problem (at least at the ﬁrst step) must be considered as a
problem inside the (non) equilibrium ensemble in the full phase space. It means,
at least, that:

A1) our dynamical variables are partitions (partition functions, hierarchy

of N-point partition functions),

A2) it is impossible to ﬁx a priori the concrete distribution function and
postulate it (e.g. Maxwell-like or other concrete distributions) but, on the con-
trary, the proper distrubution(s) must be the solutions of proper (stochastic)
dynamical problem(s), e.g., it may be the well-known framework of BBGKY hi-

3

erarchy of kinetic equations or something similar. So, the full set of dynamical
variables must include partitions also.

B) Fusion state = (meta) stable state (in the space of partitions on the
whole phase space) in which most of energy of the system is concentrated in
the relatively small area (preferable with measure zero) of the whole domain of
deﬁnition in the phase space during the time period which is enough to take
reasonable part of it outside for possible usage.

From the formal/mathematical point of view it means that:
B1) fusion state must be localized (ﬁrst of all, in the phase space),
B2) we need a set of building blocks, localized basic states or eigenmodes

which can provide

B3) the creation of localized pattern which can be considered as a possible

model for plasma in a fusion state. Such pattern must be:

B4) (meta) stable and controllable because of obvious reasons.
So, in this paper our main courses are:
C1) to present smart localized building blocks which may be not only useful
from point of view of analytical statements, such as the best possible localiza-
tion, fast convergence, sparse operators representation, etc [9], but also exist as
real physical fundamental modes,

C2) to construct various possible patterns with special attention to localized

pattern which can be considered as a needful thing in analysis of fusion;

C3) after points C1 and C2 in ensemble (BBGKY) framework to consider
some standard reductions to Vlasov-like and RMS-like equations (following the
set-up from well-known results [2]) which may be useful also. These particular
cases may be important as from physical point of view as some illustration of
general consideration [10].

Sections 5 (Part I), and 1, 2 (Part II [10]) are more or less self-consistent, so

potential readers may start from any of these Sections.

The lines above are motivated by our attempts to analyze the hidden internal
contents of the phrase mentioned in the epigraph of this paper: “A magnetically
conﬁned plasma cannot be in thermodinamical equilibrium.” We guess that it
is a well-known and well distributed fact. We found it, in particular, in the
recent review paper [1]. Of course, the following is only a ﬁrst order iteration
on the long way to the main goal but we think that one needs to start from the
right place to have some chance to reach the ﬁnal point.

2 MOTIVATIONS: INTRODUCTION INTO

MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK.
KINDERGARTEN VERSION

It is obvious that any reasonable set-up for analysis of fusion leads to very
complex system and one hardly believes that such system can be analyzed by
means of almost exhausted methods like perturbations, linearization etc. At
the same time, because such stochastic dynamics is overcompleted by short-

4

and long-living ﬂuctuations, instabilities, etc one needs to ﬁnd something more
proper than usual plane waves or gaussians for modeling a complicated com-
plex behaviour. For reminiscences we may consider simple standard soliton
equations like KdV, KP or sine-Gordon ones.
It is well-known that neither
linearization, nor perturbations, nor plane-wave-like approximations are proper
for the reasonable analysis of such equations in contrary to wave or other simple
linear equations: it is impossible to approximate the spectrum of such models
(solitons, breathers or ﬁnite-gap solutions) by means of linear Fourier harmon-
ics. They are not physical modes in complex situation. Moreover, such linear
methods are not adequate in more complicated situation.

Below, we will give kindergarten-like introduction to our analytical frame-
work. It would appear that as a ﬁrst step in this direction is to ﬁnd a reasonable
extension of understanding of the non-equilibrium dynamics as a whole. One
needs to sketch up the underlying ingredients of the theory (spaces of states, ob-
servables, measures, classes of smoothness, dynamical set-up etc) in an attempt
to provide the maximally extendable but at the same time really calculable and
realizable description of the complex dynamics inside hierarchies like BBKGY
and their reductions. The general idea is rather simple: it is well known that the
idea of “symmetry” is the key ingredient of any reasonable physical theory from
classical (in)ﬁnite dimensional (integrable) Hamiltonian dynamics to diﬀerent
sub-planckian models based on strings (branes, orbifolds, etc). During the last
century kinematical, dynamical and hidden symmetries played the key role in
our understanding of physical process. Roughly speaking, the representation
theory of underlying symmetry (classical or quantum, groups or (bi)algebras,
ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimensional, continuous or discrete) is a proper instrument for
the description of proper (orbital) dynamics. A starting point for us is a pos-
sible model for fundamental localized mode with the subsequent description of
the whole zoo of possible realizable (controllable) states/patterns which may
be useful from the point of view of experimentalists and engineers. The proper
representation theory is well known as “local nonlinear harmonic analysis”, in
particular case of simple underlying symmetry-aﬃne group-aka wavelet analysis.
From our point of view the advantages of such approach are as follows:
i) natural realization of localized states in any proper functional realization of
(functional) space of states,
ii) hidden symmetry of chosen realization of proper functional model provides
the (whole) spectrum of possible states via the so-called multiresolution decom-
position.

So, indeed, the hidden symmetry (non-abelian aﬃne group in the simplest
case) of the space of states via proper representation theory generates the phys-
ical spectrum and this procedure depends on the choice of the functional re-
alization of the space of states. It explicitly demonstrates that the structure
and properties of the functional realization of the space of states are the natural
properties of physical world at the same level of importance as a particular choice
of Hamiltonian, or the equation of motion, or the action principle (variational
method).

At the next step we need to consider the consequences of our choice i), ii)

5

for the algebra of operators. In this direction one needs to mention the class of
operators we are interested in to present the proper description for a maximally
generalized but reasonable class of problems. It seems that these must be pseu-
dodiﬀerential operators, especially if we underline that in the spirit of points
i), ii) above we need to take Weyl framework for analyzing basic equations of
motion. It is obvious, that the consideration of symbols of operators instead
of operators themselves is the starting point as for the correct mathematical
theory of pseudodiﬀerential operators as for analysis of dynamics formulated in
the language of symbols (Wigner-Weyl transform). In addition, it provides us
by uniﬁed framework for analysis as classical problems as quantum ones.

It should be noted that in such picture we can naturally include the eﬀects
of self-interaction on the way of construction and subsequent analysis of non-
linear models. So, our consideration will be in the framework of (Nonlinear)
Pseudodiﬀerential Dynamics (ΨDOD). As a result of i), ii), we will have:
iii) most sparse, almost diagonal, representation for a wide class of operators
included in the set-up of the whole problems.

It is possible by using the so-called Fast Wavelet Transform representation

for algebra of observables.

Then points i)-iii) provide us by

iv) natural (non-perturbative) multiscale decomposition for all dynamical quan-
tities such as states, observables, partitions.

Existence of such internal multiscales with diﬀerent dynamics at each scale
and transitions, interactions, and intermittency between scales demonstrates
that statistical mechanics in BBGKY form, despite its linear structure, is re-
ally a complicated problem from the mathematical point of view.
It seems,
that well-known underlying “stochastic” complexity is a result of transition by
means of (still rather unclear) procedure of evolution from complexity related
to individual classical dynamics to the rich pseudodiﬀerential (more exactly,
microlocal) structure on the non-equilibrium ensemble side.

We divide all possible conﬁgurations related to possible solutions of our

kinetic hierarchies into two classes:

qualitative type of behaviour).

(a) standard solutions; (b) controllable solutions (solutions with prescribed

Anyway, the whole zoo of solutions consists of possible patterns, including

very important ones from the point of view of underlying physics:
v) localized modes (basis modes, eigenmodes) and chaotic (deﬁnitely, non pro-
per for fusion modeling) or fusion-like localized patterns constructed from them.
It should be noted that these bases modes are nonlinear in contrast with
usual ones because they come from (non) abelian generic group while the usual
Fourier (commutative) analysis starts from U (1) abelian modes (plane waves).
They are really “eigenmodes” but in sense of decomposition of representation
of the underlying hidden symmetry group which generates the multiresolution
decomposition. The set of patterns is built from these modes by means of
variational procedures more or less standard in mathematical physics. It allows
to control the convergence from one side but, what is more important,

6

vi) to consider the problem of the control of patterns (types of behaviour) on
the level of reduced (variational) algebraical equations.

We need to mention that it is possible to change the simplest generic group
of hidden internal symmetry from the aﬃne (translations and dilations) to much
more general, but, in any case, this generic symmetry will produce the proper
natural high localized eigenmodes, as well as the decomposition of the func-
tional realization of space of states into the proper orbits; and all that allows to
compute dynamical consequence of this procedure, i.e. pattern formation, and,
as a result, to classify the whole spectrum of proper states.

For practical reasons controllable patterns (with prescribed behaviour) are
the most useful. We mention the so-called waveleton-like pattern which we
regard as the most important one. We use the following allusion in the space of
words:

{waveleton}:={soliton}
It means:

F

{wavelet}

vii) waveleton ≈ (meta)stable localized (controllable) pattern.

To summarize, the approach described below allows

viii) to solve wide classes of general ΨDOD problems, including generic for us
BBGKY hierarchy and its reductions, and
ix) to present the analytical/numerical realization for physically interesting pat-
terns, like fusion states.

We would like to emphasize the eﬀectiveness of numerical realization of
this program (minimal complexity of calculations) as additional advantage. So,
items i)-ix) point out all main features of our approach [3]-[8].

2.1 Class of Models

Here we describe a class of problems which can be analyzed by methods de-
scribed in the previous part. We start from individual dynamics and ﬁnish by
(non)-equilibrium ensembles. Me mention here as classical models as quantum
ones because both of them can be immersed in this uniﬁed framework and it is
really motivated by “quantum-like” ideology.

All models belong to the ΨDOD class and can be described by a ﬁnite or

inﬁnite (named hierarchies in such cases) system of ΨDOD equations:
a) Individual classical/quantum mechanics (cM/qM ): linear/nonlinear; {cM } ⊂
{qM }, ∗ - quantized for the class of polynomial Hamiltonians H(p, q, t) =

i.j aij (t)piqj.
An important generic example: Orbital motion (in Storage Rings). The
P
magnetic vector potential of a magnet with 2n poles in Cartesian coordinates is

A =

Knfn(x, y),

Xn

where fn is a homogeneous function of x and y of order n. The cases n = 2
to n = 5 correspond to low-order multipoles: quadrupole, sextupole, octupole,
decupole. The corresponding Hamiltonian is:

tions to diﬀerent forms of Vlasov-Maxwell/Poisson equations).

e) Wignerization of c): Quantum (Non) Equilibrium Ensembles.

Important remarks: points a)-e) are considered in ΨDO picture of (Non)Linear

ΨDO Dynamics (surely, all qM ⊂ ΨDOD); dynamical variables/observables
are the symbols of operators or functions; in case of ensembles, the main set of
dynamical variables consists of partitions (n-particle partition functions).

2.2 Eﬀects we are interested in

i) Hierarchy of internal/hidden scales (time, space, phase space).

8

ii) Non-perturbative multiscales: from slow to fast contributions, from the

coarser level of resolution/decomposition to the ﬁner one.

iii) Coexistence of hierarchy of multiscale dynamics with transitions between

scales.

iv) Realization of the key features of the complex nonequilibrium world such
as the existence of chaotic and/or entangled (complex) states with possible
destruction in some controllable regimes and transition to localized fusion-
like states.

At this level we may interpret the eﬀect of intermode interactions (in linear
but pseudodiﬀerential system!) as a result of simple interscale interaction or
intermittency (with allusion to hydrodynamics), i.e. the mixing of orbits gener-
ated by multiresolution representation of hidden underlying symmetry. Surely,
the concrete realization of such a symmetry is a natural physical property of the
physical model as well as the space of representation and its proper functional
realization.

One additional important comment: as usual in modern physics, we have
the hierarchy of underlying symmetries; so our internal symmetry of functional
realization of space of states is really not more than kinematical, because much
more rich algebraic structure, related to operator Cuntz algebra and quantum
groups, is hidden inside. The proper representations can generate much more
interesting eﬀects than ones described above. We will consider it elsewhere but
mention here only how it can be realized by the existing functorial maps between
proper categories:

{QMF} −→ Loop groups −→ Cuntz operator algebra −→ Quantum Group
structure, where {QMF} are the so-called quadratic mirror ﬁlters generating the
realization of multiresolution decomposition/representation in any functional
space; loop group is well known in many areas of physics, e.g. soliton theory,
strings etc, roughly speaking, its algebra coincides with Virasoro algebra; Cuntz
operator algebra is universal C∗ algebra generated by N elements with two
relations between them; Quantum group structure (bialgebra, Hopf algebra,
etc) is well known in many areas because of its universality. It should be noted
the appearance of natural Fock structure inside this functorial sequence above
with the creation operator realized as some generalization of Cuntz-Toeplitz
isometries. Surely, all that can open a new vision of old problems and bring
new possibilities.

We ﬁnish this part by the following qualitative deﬁnitions of key objects
(patterns). Their description and understanding in various physical models is
our main goal in this direction.

• By localized states (localized modes) we mean the building blocks for so-
lutions or generating modes which are localized in maximally small region
of the phase (as in c- as in q-case) space.

9

• By a chaotic pattern we mean some solution (or asymptotics of solution)
which has random-like distributed energy spectrum in the full domain of
deﬁnition.

• By a localized pattern (waveleton) we mean (asymptotically) (meta) stable
solution localized in a relatively small region of the whole phase space (or
a domain of deﬁnition). In this case the energy is distributed during some
time (suﬃciently large) between only a few localized modes (from point
1). We believe it to be a good model for plasma in fusion state (energy
conﬁnement).

the appearance of multiscales (orbits) and the existence of high-localized
natural (eigen)modes [9].

iv) Variational formulation (control of convergence, reductions to algebraic

systems, control of type of behaviour).

3 SET-UP/FORMULATION

Let us consider the following generic ΨDOD dynamical problem

Lj{Opi}Ψ = 0,

(5)

described by a ﬁnite or inﬁnite number of equations which include general classes
of operators Opi such as diﬀerential, integral, pseudodiﬀerential etc
Surely, all hierarchies and their reductions are inside this class.
The main objects are:

i) (Hilbert) space of states, H = {Ψ}, with a proper functional realiza-
tion, e.g.,: L2, Sobolev, Schwartz, C0, Ck, ... C∞, ...; deﬁnitely, L2(R2),
L2(S2), L2(S1 × S1), L2(S1 × S1 ⋉ Zn) are diﬀerent objects proper for
diﬀerent physics inside. E.g., two last cases describe tokamak and stel-
larator, correspondingly. Of course, they are diﬀerent spaces and generate
diﬀerent physics.

v) Measures: multifractal wavelet measures {µi} together with the class of
smoothness are very important for analysis of complicated analytical be-
haviour [9].

vi) Variational/Projection methods, from Galerkin to Rabinowitz minimax,
Floer (in symplectic case of Arnold-Weinstein curves with preservation of
Poisson or symplectic structures). Main advantages are the reduction to
algebraic systems, which provides a tool for the smart subsequent control
of behaviour and control of convergence.

vii) Multiresolution or multiscale decomposition, M RA (or wavelet micro-
scope) consists of the understanding and choosing of (internal) symmetry
structure, e.g., aﬃne group = {translations, dilations} or many others;
construction of representation/action of this symmetry on H = {Ψ}.

As a result of such hidden coherence together with using point vi) we’ll
have:

a). LOCALIZED BASES

b). EXACT MULTISCALE DECOMPOSITION

with the best convergence properties and real evaluation of the rate of
convergence via proper “multi-norms”.

Figure 2, 3, 5, 6 demonstrate MRA decompositions for one- and multi-
kicks while Figures 4 and 7 present the same for the case of the generic
simple fractal model, Riemann-Weierstrass function [9].

viii) Eﬀectiveness of proper numerics: CPU-time, HDD-space, minimal com-
plexity of algorithms, and (Shannon) entropy of calculations are provided
by points i)-vii) above.

ix) Quantization via ∗ star product or Deformation Quantization.

It was

considered elsewhere [8].

Finally, such Variational-Multiscale approach based on points i)-ix) provides us
by the full ZOO of PATTERNS: LOCALIZED, CHAOTIC, etc.

In next Sections we will consider details for important case of kinetic equa-

tions.

We present the explicit analytical construction for solutions of BBGKY hi-
erarchy, which is based on tensor algebra extensions of multiresolution represen-
tation for states, observables, partitions and variational formulation. We give
explicit representation for hierarchy of n-particle reduced distribution functions
in the base of high-localized generalized coherent (regarding underlying generic
symmetry (aﬃne group in the simplest case)) states given by polynomial ten-
sor algebra of our basis functions (wavelet families, wavelet packets), which
takes into account contributions from all underlying hidden multiscales from
the coarsest scale of resolution to the ﬁnest one to provide full information

12

about dynamical process. In some sense, our approach for ensembles (hierar-
chies) resembles Bogolyubov’s one and related approaches but we don’t use any
perturbation technique (like virial expansion) or linearization procedures. Most
important, that numerical modeling in all cases shows the creation of diﬀer-
ent internal (coherent) structures from localized modes, which are related to
stable (equilibrium) or unstable type of behaviour and corresponding pattern
(waveletons) formation.

4 INTRODUCTION INTO PHYSICAL

MOTIVES

So, we will consider the application of our numerical/analytical technique based
on local nonlinear harmonic analysis approach for the description of complex
non-equilibrium behaviour of statistical ensembles, considered in the framework
of the general BBGKY hierarchy of kinetic equations and their diﬀerent trun-
cations/reductions. The main points of our ideology are described below. All
these facts are well-known or described above but it is preferable to bring it
together to present our arguments in more clear form.

• Kinetic theory is an important part of general statistical physics related
to phenomena which cannot be understood on the thermodynamic or ﬂuid
models level.

• We restrict ourselves to the rational/polynomial type of nonlinearities
(with respect to the set of all dynamical variables, including partitions)
that allows to use our results, based on the so called multiresolution frame-
work and the variational formulation of initial nonlinear (pseudodiﬀeren-
tial) problems.

• Our approach is based on the set of mathematical methods which give
a possibility to work with well-localized bases in functional spaces and
provide the maximum sparse forms for the general type of operators (dif-
ferential, integral, pseudodiﬀerential) in such bases.

• It provides the best possible rates of convergence and minimal complexity
of algorithms inside and, as a result, saves CPU time and HDD space.

• In all cases below by the system under consideration we mean the full
BBGKY hierarchy or some its cut-oﬀ or its various reductions. Our scheme
of cut-oﬀ for the inﬁnite system of equations is based on some criterion of
convergence of the full solution by means of some norm introduced in the
proper functional space constructed by us.

• This criterion is based on a natural norm in the proper functional space,
which takes into account (non-perturbatively) the underlying multiscale
structure of complex statistical dynamics. According to our approach the

13

choice of the underlying functional space is important to understand the
corresponding complex dynamics.

• It is obvious that we need accurately to ﬁx the space, where we construct
the solutions, evaluate convergence etc. and where the very complicated
inﬁnite set of operators, appeared in the BBGKY formulation, acts.

• We underline that many concrete features of the complex dynamics are
related not only to the concrete form/class of operators/equations but de-
pend also on the proper choice of function spaces, where operators act. It
should be noted that the class of smoothness (related at least to the ap-
pearance of chaotic/fractal-like type of behaviour) of the proper functional
space under consideration plays a key role in the following.

• At this stage our main goal is an attempt of classiﬁcation and construction
of a possible zoo of nontrivial (meta) stable states/patterns: high-localized
(nonlinear) eigenmodes, complex (chaotic-like or entangled) patterns, lo-
calized (stable) patterns (waveletons). We will use it later for fusion de-
scription, modeling and control.

• Localized (meta)stable pattern (waveleton) is a good image for fusion state

in plasma (energy conﬁnement).

Our constructions can be applied to the following general individual (mem-

bers of ensemble under consideration) Hamiltonians:

where the potentials Ui(q) = Ui(q1, . . . , qN ) and Uij (qi, qj) are restricted to ra-
tional functions on the coordinates. Let Ls and Lij be the Liouvillean operators
and

FN (x1, . . . , xN ; t)

be the hierarchy of N -particle distribution function, satisfying the standard

Our key point is the proper nonperturbative generalization of the previous per-
turbative multiscale approaches. The inﬁnite hierarchy of distribution functions
is:

F = {F0, F1(x1; t), . . . , FN (x1, . . . , xN ; t), . . .},

(11)

where

Fp(x1, . . . , xp; t) ∈ H p,
H 0 = R, H p = L2(R6p), F ∈ H ∞ = H 0 ⊕ H 1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ H p ⊕ . . .

• Multiresolution decomposition naturally and eﬃciently introduces the in-
ﬁnite sequence of the underlying hidden scales, which is a sequence of
increasing closed subspaces Vj ∈ L2(R):

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

(14)

• Our variational approach reduces the initial problem to the problem of so-
lution of functional equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraic prob-
lems at the second one. As a result, the solutions of the (truncated)
hierarchies have the following multiscale decomposition via high-localized
eigenmodes (ωl ∼ 2l, ks

m ∼ 2m)

F (t, x1, x2, . . .) =

aij U i ⊗ V j(t, x1, . . .),

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying
time/space scales.

• In this way one obtains contributions to the full solution from each scale
of resolution or each time/space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode.

• It should be noted that such representations give the best possible local-
ization properties in the corresponding (phase) space/time coordinates.

• Numerical calculations are based on compactly supported wavelets and
related wavelet families and on evaluation of the accuracy on the level N
of the corresponding cut-oﬀ of the full system w.r.t. the norm above.

• Numerical modeling shows the creation of diﬀerent internal structures
from localized modes, which are related to (meta)stable or unstable type
of behaviour and the corresponding patterns (waveletons) formation. Re-
duced algebraic structure provides the pure algebraic control of stabil-
ity/unstability scenario.

• As a ﬁnal point we will consider the construction for

5 BBGKY HIERARCHY

We start from set-up for kinetic BBGKY hierarchy and present explicit ana-
lytical construction for solutions of hierarchy of equations, which is based on
tensor algebra extensions of multiresolution representation and variational for-
mulation. We give explicit representation for hierarchy of n-particle reduced
distribution functions in the base of high-localized generalized coherent (w.r.t.
underlying aﬃne group) states given by polynomial tensor algebra of wavelets,
which takes into account contributions from all underlying hidden multiscales
from the coarsest scale of resolution to the ﬁnest one to provide full information
about stochastic dynamical process.

Let M be the phase space of ensemble of N particles (dimM = 6N ) with

where Gk are correlators, really have additional reductions as in the simplest
case of one-particle Vlasov/Boltzmann-like systems. Then by using such phys-
ical motivated reductions or/and during the corresponding cut-oﬀ procedure
we obtain instead of linear and pseudodiﬀerential (in general case) equations
their ﬁnite-dimensional but nonlinear approximations with the polynomial type
of nonlinearities (more exactly, multilinearities). Our key point in the follow-
ing consideration is the proper generalization of naive perturbative multiscale
Bogolyubov’s structure.

6 MULTISCALE ANALYSIS

The inﬁnite hierarchy of distribution functions satisfying BBGKY system in the
thermodynamical limit is:

F = {F0, F1(x1; t), F2(x1, x2; t), . . . , FN (x1, . . . , xN ; t), . . .},

(34)

where

Fp(x1, . . . , xp; t) ∈ H p, H 0 = R, H p = L2(R6p)

(or any diﬀerent proper functional space),

F ∈ H ∞ = H 0 ⊕ H 1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ H p ⊕ . . .

with the natural Fock-space like norm (of course, we keep in mind the positivity
of the full measure):

First of all we consider F = F (t) as function of the time variable only, F ∈
L2(R), via multiresolution decomposition which naturally and eﬃciently intro-
duces the inﬁnite sequence of underlying hidden scales into the game.

Because aﬃne group of translations and dilations is inside the approach,
this method resembles the action of a microscope. We have contribution to
ﬁnal result from each scale of resolution from the whole inﬁnite scale of spaces.
Let the closed subspace Vj (j ∈ Z) correspond to level j of resolution, or to
scale j. We consider a multiresolution analysis of L2(R) (of course, we may
consider any diﬀerent functional space) which is a sequence of increasing closed
subspaces Vj [9]:

...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ...

satisfying the following properties: let Wj be the orthonormal complement of
Vj with respect to Vj+1:

then we have the following decomposition:

Vj+1 = Vj

or in case when V0 is the coarsest scale of resolution:

Subgroup of translations generates basis for ﬁxed scale number:

spank∈Z {2j/2Ψ(2jt − k)} = Wj .

The whole basis is generated by action of full aﬃne group:

spank∈Z,j∈Z {2j/2Ψ(2jt − k)} = spank,j∈Z {Ψj,k} = {F (t)}.

(44)

Let sequence

and φi(xi) ≡ φ(xi) form a multiresolution basis corresponding to {V xi

Also, we may use the rectangle lattice of scales and one-dimentional wavelet
decomposition:

f (x1, x2) =

where bases functions

depend on two scales 2−i and 2−j [9].

We obtain our multiscale/multiresolution representations below via the vari-
ational wavelet approach for the following formal representation of the BBGKY
system (or its ﬁnite-dimensional nonlinear approximation for the n-particle dis-
tribution functions) with the corresponding obvious constraints on the distribu-
tion functions.

7 VARIATIONAL APPROACH

Let L be an arbitrary (non)linear differential/integral operator with matrix di-
mension d (ﬁnite or inﬁnite), which acts on some set of functions from L2(Ω⊗n
):
xi ∈ Ω ⊂ R6,
Ψ ≡ Ψ(t, x1, x2, . . .) =

Let us consider now the N mode approximation for the solution as the following
ansatz:

ΨN (t, x1, x2, . . .) =

ai0i1i2...Ai0 ⊗ Bi1 ⊗ Ci2 . . . (t, x1, x2, . . .). (57)

N

Xi0,i1,i2,...=1

We shall determine the expansion coeﬃcients from the following conditions

(diﬀerent related variational approaches are considered also):

ℓN
k0,k1,k2,... ≡

(LΨN )Ak0 (t)Bk1 (x1)Ck2 (x2)dtdx1dx2 . . . = 0.

(58)

Thus, we have exactly dN n algebraical equations for dN n unknowns ai0,i1,....
This variational approach reduces the initial problem to the problem of solution
of functional equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the
second. We consider the multiresolution expansion as the second main part
of our construction. The solution is parametrized by the solutions of two sets
of reduced algebraical problems, one is linear or nonlinear (depending on the
structure of the operator L) and the rest are linear problems related to the
computation of the coeﬃcients of the algebraic equations. These coeﬃcients
can be found by some methods by using the compactly supported wavelet basis
functions.

As a result the solution has the following multiscale/multiresolution decom-

position via nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes

F (t, x1, x2, . . .) =

aij U i ⊗ V j(t, x1, x2, . . .),

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying
time/space scales. These formulae give the expansion into a slow and fast os-
cillating parts. So, we may move from the coarse scales of resolution to the
ﬁnest ones for obtaining more detailed information about the dynamical pro-
cess. In this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of

resolution or each time/space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode. It should
be noted that such representations give the best possible localization properties
in the corresponding (phase)space/time coordinates. In contrast with diﬀerent
approaches our formulae do not use perturbation technique or linearization pro-
cedures. Numerical calculations are based on compactly supported wavelets and
related wavelet families and on evaluation of the accuracy regarding norm (37):

kF N +1 − F N k ≤ ε

(60)

8 MODELING OF PATTERNS

To summarize, the key points are:

some polynomial tensor algebra.

1. The ansatz-oriented choice of the (multidimensional) bases related to

2. The choice of proper variational principle. A few projection or Galerkin-
like principles for constructing (weak) solutions are considered. The advantages
of formulations related to biorthogonal (wavelet) decomposition should be noted.
3. The choice of bases functions in the scale spaces Wj from wavelet zoo.
They correspond to high-localized (nonlinear) oscillations/excitations, nontriv-
ial local (stable) distributions/ﬂuctuations, etc. Besides fast convergence prop-
erties it should be noted minimal complexity of all underlying calculations,
especially in case of choice of wavelet packets which minimize Shannon entropy.
4. Operator representations providing maximum sparse representations for

arbitrary (pseudo) diﬀerential/ integral operators:

df /dx, dnf /dxn,

T (x, y)f (y)dy, etc [9].

5. (Multi)linearization. Besides the variation approach we can consider also
R
a diﬀerent method to deal with (polynomial) nonlinearities: para-products-like
decompositions [9].

Formulae (57), (59) provide, in principle, a fast convergent decomposition
for the general solutions of the systems (31), (32), (56) in terms of contributions
from all underlying hidden internal scales. Of course, we cannot guarantee that
each concrete system (32) with ﬁxed coeﬃcients will have a priori a speciﬁc type
of behaviour, either localized or chaotic. Instead, we can analyze whether such
typical structures described by qualitative deﬁnitions from Section 2.2. really
appear.

To classify the qualitative behaviour we apply standard methods from gen-
eral control theory or really use the control. We start from a priori unknown
coeﬃcients, the exact values of which will subsequently be recovered. Roughly
speaking, we ﬁx only class of nonlinearity (polynomial in our case) which cov-
ers a broad variety of examples of possible truncation of the systems. As a
simple model we choose band-triangular non-sparse matrices (aij ) in particu-
lar case d = 2. These matrices provide tensor structure of bases in (extended)
phase space and are generated by the roots of the reduced variational (Galerkin-
like) systems. As a second step we need to restore the coeﬃcients from these
matrices by which we may classify the types of behaviour. We start with the

22

two-dimensional localized base eigenmode (Fig. 9, d=2), which was constructed
as a tensor product of the two localized one-dimensional modes (Fig. 8, d=1).
Fig. 10, corresponding to chaotic pattern, presents the result of summation of
series up to value of the dilation/scale parameter equal to six on the bases of
symmlets with the corresponding matrix elements equal to one. The size of ma-
trix is 512x512 and as a result we provide modeling for one-particle distribution
function corresponding to standard Vlasov-like cut-oﬀ with F2 = F 2
1 . So, dif-
ferent possible distributions of the root values of the generic algebraical system
(58) provide qualitatively diﬀerent types of behaviour. The above choice pro-
vides us by a distribution with chaotic-like equidistribution. But, if we consider
a band-like structure of matrix (aij) with the band along the main diagonal with
ﬁnite size (≪ 512) and values, e.g. ﬁve, while the other values are equal to one,
we obtain localization in a ﬁxed ﬁnite area of the full phase space, i.e. almost
all energy of the system is concentrated in this small volume. This corresponds
to waveleton case and is shown in Fig. 11, constructed by means of Daubechies-
based wavelet packets. Depending on the type of solution, such localization may
be present during the whole time evolution (asymptotically-stable) or up to the
needed value on time scale, e.g., enough for plasma fusion/conﬁnement.

Now we discuss how to solve the inverse/synthesis problem or how to restore

the coeﬃcients of the initial systems (31), (32). Let

L0(Q0)Ψ0 = 0

(61)

be the system (56) with the ﬁxed coeﬃcients Q0. The corresponding solution
Ψ0 is represented by formulae (57) or (59), which are parametrized by roots of
reduced algebraic system (58) and constructed by some choice of the tensor
product bases from Section 6. The proper counterpart of the system (61) with
prescribed behaviour Ψu, corresponding to a given choice of both tensor product
structure and coeﬃcients {aij} described above, corresponds to the class of
systems like (56) but with undetermined coeﬃcients Qu and has the same form

Lu(Qu)Ψu = 0.

(62)

Our goal is to restore coeﬃcients Qu from (61), (62) and explicit representations
for solutions Ψ0 and Ψu. This is a standard problem in the adaptive control
theory: one adds a controlling signal u(x, t) which deforms the controlled signal
Ψ(x, t) from the ﬁxed state Ψ0(x, t) to the prescribed one Ψu(x, t). At the
same time one can determine the parameters Qu [3]. Finally, we apply two
variational constructions. The ﬁrst one gives the systems of algebraic equations
for unknown coeﬃcients, generated by the following set of functionals

ΦN =

(L0 − Lu)Ψu

N , Ψ0
N

dµN ,

Z (cid:16)

(cid:17)

(63)

where N means the N -order approximation according to formulae (57). The
unknown parameters Q∗ are given by Q∗ = limN→∞ Qu
N . The second is an
important additional constraint on the region µ0 in the phase space where we

23

are interested in localization of almost all energy E =
the proper energy Marsden-like functional [2].

We believe that the appearance of nontrivial localized (meta) stable pat-
terns observed by these methods is a general eﬀect which present in the full
BBGKY-hierarchy, due to its complicated intrinsic multiscale dynamics and it
depends on neither the cut-oﬀ level nor the phenomenological-like hypothesis on
correlators. So, representations for solutions like (59) and as a result the pre-
diction of the existence of the (asymptotically) stable localized patterns/states
(waveletons) which can realize energy conﬁnement (fusion) states in BBGKY-
like systems are the main results of this approach. In addition, lines above in
this Section open way to solve the control problem by means of reduction from
initial (pseudodiﬀerential) formulation to reduced set of algebraic one (58) and
as a result to create and support the needed fusion state(s).

9 CONCLUSIONS

Let us summarize our main results:

• Physical Conjectures:

• P1

• P2

• M2

State of fusion (conﬁnement of energy) in plasma physics may and need be
considered from the point of view of non-equilibrium statistical physics.
According to this BBGKY framework looks naturally as ﬁrst iteration.
Main dynamical variables are partitions.

High localized nonlinear eigenmodes (Figures 1, 8, 9) are real physical
modes important for fusion modeling. Intermode multiscale interactions
create various patterns from these fundamental building blocks, and de-
termine the behaviour of plasma.

High localized (meta) stable patterns (waveletons), considered as long-
living ﬂuctuations, are proper images for plasma in fusion state (Figures
12, 13).

• Mathematical framework:

• M1 Problems under consideration, like BBGKY hierarchies (31) or their
reductions (32) and (3)-(5), (20), (21), (26) from part II [10] are considered
as ΨDO problems in the framework of proper family of methods uniﬁed
by eﬀective multiresolution approach.

Formulae (59) based on generalized dispersion relations (GDR) (58) pro-
vide exact multiscale representation for all dynamical variables (partitions,

24

ﬁrst of all) in the basis of high-localized nonlinear (eigen)modes. Numer-
ical realizations in this framework are maximally eﬀective from the point
of view of complexity of all algorithms inside. GDR provide the way for
the state control on the algbraic level.

• Realizability

According to this approach, it is possible on formal level, in principle,
to control ensemble behaviour and to realize the localization of energy
(conﬁnement state) inside the waveleton conﬁgurations created from a
few fundamentals modes only (Figures 14, 15).

• Open Questions

• Q1

Deﬁnitely, all above is only very naive ensemble approach. Current level
of non-equilibrium statistical physics provides us only by BBGKY generic
framework. All related internal problems are well-known but we still have
nothing better. At the same time possible Vlasov-like reductions or phe-
nomenological models also look as very far from reasonable from the point
of view of the fusion problem set-up.

Considering for allusion successful areas of physics like superconductivity,
for example, we may conclude that only microscopic BCS formulation pro-
vides the full explanation although Ginzburg-Landau (GL) phenomenolog-
ical approach and even Froelich’s and London’s ones contributed to the
general picture. Whether Vlasov equations are the analogue of GL ones
and whether it is possible to construct microscopic model for plasma, these
two important questions remain unanswered at present time.

• Q2

• Q3

It may be natural also that approaches proposed in this paper and re-
lated ones are wrong because the proper and adequate framework for
solution of fusion problem is related to conﬁnement of magnetic lines or
loops (new physical dynamical variables instead of partitions) or ﬂuxes
instead of conﬁnement of localized point modes (attribute of any local
ﬁeld theory) considered as new and really proper physical variables. Such
approach demands the topological background related to proper mathe-
matical constructions. As allusion it is possible to consider the descrip-
tion of (fractional) quantum Hall eﬀect by means of Chern-Simons/anyon
models which allow to describe the dynamics on (of) knots and braids
analytically. Anyway, it is still possible to apply successfull methods from
(M1) and (M2) here too. Remarks in Section 2.2. demonstrate interesting
relations. Other open possibility is related to taking into account internal
quantum properties. From this point of view our approach is very useful
because we unify quantum description and its classical counterpart in the
general ΨDO framework.

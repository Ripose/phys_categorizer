Abstract

The problem of sheath formation in front of a conductive planar plate in-
serted into the plasma is formulated.
Initially, the plate is assumed to be
neutral. It is shown that the charging-up process of the plate is accompanied
by the excitation of electron plasma waves.

1 Introduction

Investigations of sheath formation in front of a ﬂoating plate have hitherto been
restricted to ﬂuid studies on the ion time scale [1]. By contrast, the response of the
plasma in the very early stages of sheath formation is not well known. In this paper,
we present PIC simulations of the plasma dynamics over just a few electron plasma
periods after the beginning of the process. These simulations have been performed
by means of the BIT1 code [2], developed on the basis of the XPDP1 code from U.
C. Berkeley [3].

A ﬂoating plate is placed in contact with a uniform, quasi-neutral plasma, which
is assumed to be inﬁnitely extended on one side. Due to the higher thermal velocity of
the electrons, the plate starts charging up negatively, so that electrons are gradually
repelled, ions are attracted, and a positive-space-charge sheath begins to form. An
electron plasma wave is observed the properties of which strongly depend on the
plasma characteristics (electron and ion temperatures, plasma density, etc.).

Our PIC simulations are performed with diﬀerent numerical set-ups and plasma
characteristics. A full set of simulation diagnostics is used to measure the properties
of the electron waves.

2 Simulation set-up

We consider a one-dimensional system. The planar conducting plate and the
(artiﬁcial) right-hand boundary of the systems are placed at positions x = 0 and
x = L > 0, respectively. The length L is to be chosen large enough for this system
to reasonably approximate a semi-inﬁnite plasma (L >> λD, with λD the electron
Debye length). In order to have adequate resolution in space, the length of the grid
cells has been selected as ∆x

λD/2.

Initial and boundary conditions

At the initial time (t = 0) the electron and ion densities are equal (ne0 = ni0 =
n0), the distribution functions of both particle species are fully Maxwellian, and the
electric potential is zero (V = 0) everywhere in the system, including the plate surface.
Throughout the entire simulation, the following boundary conditions are applied
to the particles: At the plate, all particles impinging are absorbed and no particles
are injected into the plasma. At the right-hand boundary, on the other hand, all
particles impinging are absorbed but new particles with half Maxwellian distribution
functions are injected at a constant rate. The system is ﬂoating, i.e., the sum of
particle plus displacement currents equals zero. According to these conditions we
observe the following behavior.

→

In the unperturbed plasma region (i.e., for x

L) the electron velocity distri-
bution function will not change appreciably (so that E(L, t) = 0), whereas at the
plate it will acquire a cut-oﬀ form. This is because the negative-velocity electrons
are absorbed by the plate and charge it negatively; during this process, the ions can
be considered to be at rest. With increasing negative surface charge, the negative
potential drop in the region close to the plate becomes higher and more and more
electrons are reﬂected towards the plasma. After some time this perturbation propa-
gates into the system. The shape of the distribution function essentially depends on
the potential drop at the plate.

Due to the loss of particles by absorption at the plate, the total number of particles
in the system is dropping all the time. However, this aspect is not of great concern here
because the total loss of particles during the entire simulation presented is negligible.

2.2 Simulation parameters

In the following tables we present the parameters used for our simulation. The
(electron and ion) particle ﬂuxes corresponding to the unperturbed plasma region

Figure 1 shows the potential proﬁle
10−8
close to the plate at t = 6.477
s. The potential drop at the beginning
of the sheath evolution is monotonic in
space. After quick acquisition of nega-
tive charge, the plate repels the electrons
in the form of a pulse leaving behind a
positive-space charge region. As a result,
the potential close to the plate becomes
slightly positive. In front of this region,
the negative space charge produced by
the primary-pulse electrons leads to a
potential minimum (”virtual cathode”),
which gradually reﬂects more and more
slower electrons back into the plasma.
These latter electrons spend a long time
in the region of the virtual cathode and

To verify that these waves are phys-
ical and not just due to numerical ef-
fects, we have performed other simula-
tions with diﬀerent parameters. In par-
ticular, we concentrated on the electron
temperature. We know that the Debye
length is proportional to the square root
of the electron temperature. Hence, if we
increase the temperature by a factor of
four, the Debye length must increase by
a factor of two. Since, in addition, there
is a relation between the wavelength of
the electron waves and the Debye length,
the variation of the electron temperature
should also have an eﬀect on the wave-
length. This is clearly illustrated in
Figure 4, where the wavelength is seen to increase with the square root of the electron
temperature.

4 Summary and conclusions

This work represents the beginning of a self-consistent kinetic study of sheath
formation, taking into account both electron and ion dynamics. Here, during the

short simulation time considered, the ions are practically immobile, and only the
electrons take part in the process. In the next step, the eﬀect of ion dynamics on
sheath formation will be considered as well.

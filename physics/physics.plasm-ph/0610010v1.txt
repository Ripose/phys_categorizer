Electric and magnetic ﬁelds of fractal distribution of charged particles are consid-

ered. The fractional integrals are used to describe fractal distribution. The fractional

integrals are considered as approximations of integrals on fractals. Using the frac-

tional generalization of integral Maxwell equation, the simple examples of the ﬁelds of

homogeneous fractal distribution are considered. The electric dipole and quadrupole

moments for fractal distribution are derived.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Derivatives and integrals of fractional order [1] have found many applications in recent

studies in physics. The interest in fractional analysis has been growing continually in recent

years. Fractional analysis has numerous applications: kinetic theories [2, 3, 4]; statistical

mechanics [5, 6, 7]; dynamics in complex media [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; electromagnetic theory

[13, 14, 15, 16] and many others. The new type of problem has increased rapidly in areas

in which the fractal features of a process or the medium impose the necessity of using

nontraditional tools in ”regular” smooth physical equations.

In order to use fractional

derivatives and fractional integrals for fractal distribution, we must use some continuous

medium model [9]. We propose to describe the fractal distribution by a fractional continuous

medium [9], where all characteristics and ﬁelds are deﬁned everywhere in the volume but

they follow some generalized equations which are derived by using fractional integrals. In

many problems the real fractal structure of medium can be disregarded and the fractal

distribution can be replaced by some fractional continuous mathematical model. Smoothing

of microscopic characteristics over the physically inﬁnitesimal volume transforms the initial

fractal distribution into fractional continuous model [9] that uses the fractional integrals. The

order of fractional integral is equal to the fractal dimension of distribution. The fractional

integrals allow us to take into account the fractality of the distribution. Fractional integrals

are considered as approximations of integrals on fractals [17, 18]. In Ref. [17], the authors

proved that integrals on net of fractals can be approximated by fractional integrals.

In

Ref.

[5], we proved that fractional integrals can be considered as integrals over the space

with fractional dimension up to numerical factor. In order to prove, we use the formulas of

dimensional regularizations [19].

We can consider electric and magnetic ﬁelds of fractal distribution of charged particles.

Fractal distribution can be described by fractional continuous medium model [4, 9, 11, 12].

In the general case, the fractal distribution of particles cannot be considered as continuous

medium. There are points and domains that have no particles. In Ref. [9], we suggest to con-

sider the fractal distributions as special (fractional) continuous media. We use the procedure

of replacement of the distribution with fractal mass dimension by some continuous model

that uses fractional integrals. This procedure is a fractional generalization of Christensen

approach [20]. Suggested procedure leads to the fractional integration and diﬀerentiation

to describe fractal distribution. In this paper, we consider the electric and magnetic ﬁelds

of fractal distribution of charged particles. In Sec. II, the densities of electric charge and

current for fractal distribution are considered.

In Sec.

III and Sec.

IV, we consider the

simple examples of the ﬁelds of homogeneous fractal distribution. In Sec. V, we consider

the fractional generalization of integral Maxwell equation. In Sec. VI, the examples of elec-

tric dipole and quadrupole moments for fractal distribution are considered. Finally, a short

conclusion is given in Sec. VII.

II. ELECTRIC CHARGE AND CURRENT DENSITIES

A. Electric charge for fractal distribution

Let us consider a fractal distribution of charged particles. For example, we can assume

that charged particles with a constant density are distributed over the fractal. In this case,

the number of particles N enclosed in a volume with characteristic size R satisﬁes the scaling

law N(R) ∼ RD, whereas for a regular n-dimensional Euclidean object we have N(R) ∼ Rn.

For charged particles with number density n(r, t), we have that the charge density can

3

(1)

(2)

(3)

be deﬁned by

ρ(r, t) = qn(r, t),

where q is the charge of a particle (for electron, q = −e). The total charge of region W is

then given by the integral

ZW
or Q(W ) = qN(W ), where N(W ) is a number of particles in the region W . The fractional

Q(W ) =

ρ(r, t)dV3,

generalization of this equation can be written in the following form

where D is a fractal dimension of the distribution, and dVD is an element of D-dimensional

volume such that

the relation

Q(W ) =

ρ(r, t)dVD,

ZW

dVD = c3(D, r)dV3.

c3(D, r) =

23−DΓ(3/2)
Γ(D/2)

|r|D−3.

For the Riesz deﬁnition of the fractional integral [1], the function c3(D, r) is deﬁned by

The initial points of the fractional integral are set to zero. The numerical factor in Eq. (2)

has this form in order to derive usual integral in the limit D → (3 − 0). Note that the
usual numerical factor γ−1
3 (D) = Γ(1/2)/[2Dπ3/2Γ(D/2)], which is used in Ref. [1] leads to
γ−1
3 (3 − 0) = Γ(1/2)/[23π3/2Γ(3/2)] in the limit D → (3 − 0).

For the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral [1], the function c3(D, r) is deﬁned by

c3(D, r) =

|xyz|D/3−1
Γ3(D/3)

.

Here we use Cartesian’s coordinates x, y, and z. In order to have the usual dimensions of

the physical values, we can use vector r, and coordinates x, y, z as dimensionless values.

Note that the interpretation of fractional integration is connected with fractional di-

mension [5, 6]. This interpretation follows from the well-known formulas for dimensional

regularizations [19]. The fractional integral can be considered as an integral in the fractional

dimension space up to the numerical factor Γ(D/2)/[2πD/2Γ(D)].

If we consider the ball region W = {r :

|r| ≤ R}, and the spherically symmetric

distribution of charged particles (n(r, t) = n(r)), then we have

N(R) = 4π

For the homogeneous (n(r) = n0) fractal distribution, we get

N(R) = 4πn0

23−DΓ(3/2)
Γ(D/2)

∼ RD.

Fractal distribution of particles is called a homogeneous fractal distribution if the power law

N(R) ∼ RD does not depend on the translation of the region. The homogeneity property
of the distribution can be formulated in the following form: For all regions, W and W ′
such that the volumes are equal, V (W ) = V (W ′), we have that the numbers of particles
in these regions are equal too, N(W ) = N(W ′). Note that the wide class of fractal media

satisﬁes the homogeneous property. In Ref. [9], the continuous medium model for the fractal

distribution of particles was suggested. Note that the fractality and homogeneity properties

can be realized in the following forms:

(1) Homogeneity: The local number density of homogeneous fractal distribution is a trans-

lation invariant value that has the form n(r) = n0 = const.

(2) Fractality: The number of particles in the ball region W obeys a power law relation

ND(W ) ∼ RD, where D < 3, R is the radius of the ball.

B. Electric current of fractal distribution

For charged particles with number density n(r, t) ﬂowing with velocity u = u(r, t), the

resulting density current J(r, t) is given by

J(r, t) = qn(r, t)u,

where q is the charge of a particle (for electron, q = −e).

The electric current is deﬁned as the ﬂux of electric charge. Measuring the ﬁeld J(r, t)

passing through a surface S = ∂W gives the current (ﬂux of charge)

I(S) = ΦJ (S) =

(J, dS2),

ZS

where J = J(r, t) is the current ﬁeld vector, dS2 = dS2n is a diﬀerential unit of area pointing

perpendicular to the surface S, and the vector n = nkek is a vector of normal. The fractional

generalization of this equation for the fractal distribution can be written in the following

form:

I(S) =

(J(r, t), dSd),

ZS

5

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

where we use

dSd = c2(d, r)dS2,

c2(d, r) =

22−d
Γ(d/2)

|r|d−2.

Note that c2(2, r) = 1 for d = 2. In general, the boundary ∂W has the dimension d. In the

general case, the dimension d is not equal to 2 and is not equal to (D − 1).

C. Charge conservation for fractal distribution

The electric charge has a fundamental property established by numerous experiments:

the change of the quantity of charge inside a region W bounded by the surface S = ∂W is

always equal to the ﬂux of charge through this surface. This is known as the law of charge

conservation. If we denote by J(r, t) the electric current density, then charge conservation

is written

or, in the form

dQ(W )
dt

= −I(S),

d
dt ZW

ρ(r, t)dVD = −

(J(r, t), dSd).

In particular, when the surface S = ∂W is ﬁxed, we can write

III. ELECTRIC FIELD OF FRACTAL DISTRIBUTION

A. Electric ﬁeld and Coulomb’s law

For a point charge Q at position r′ (i.e., an electric monopole), the electric ﬁeld at a point

r is deﬁned in MKS by

E =

Q
4πε0

r − r′
|r − r′|3 ,

where ε0 is a fundamental constant called the permittivity of free space.

For a continuous stationary distribution ρ(r′) of charge, the electric ﬁeld E at a point r

is given in MKS by

E(r) =

1

4πε0 ZW

r − r′
|r − r′|3 ρ(r′)dV ′
3,

where ε0 is the permittivity of free space. For Cartesian’s coordinates dV ′

3 = dx′dy′dz′.

The fractional generalization of Eq. (8) for a fractal distribution of charge is given by

the equation

E(r) =

1

4πε0 ZW

r − r′
|r − r′|3 ρ(r′)dV ′
D,

where dV ′

D = c3(D, r′)dV ′

3. Equation (9) can be considered as Coulomb’s law written for a

fractal stationary distribution of electric charges.

Measuring the electric ﬁeld passing through a surface S = ∂W gives the electric ﬂux

ΦE(S) =

(E, dS2),

ZS

where E is the electric ﬁeld vector, and dS2 is a diﬀerential unit of area pointing perpendic-

ular to the surface S.

B. Gauss’s law for fractal distribution

Gauss’s law tells us that the total ﬂux ΦE(S) of the electric ﬁeld E through a closed

surface S = ∂W is proportional to the total electric charge Q(W ) inside the surface:

ΦE(∂W ) =

Q(W ).

1
ε0

(10)

The electric ﬂux out of any closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed within

the surface.

7

(11)

(12)

(13)

For the fractal distribution, Gauss’s law states

(E, dS2) =

ρ(r, t)dVD

ZS

ε0 ZW

in MKS, where E = E(r, t) is the electric ﬁeld, and ρ(r, t) is the charge density, dVD =

c3(D, r)dV3, and ε0 is the permittivity of free space.

Gauss’s law by itself can be used to ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld of a point charge at rest, and the

principle of superposition can then be used to ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld of an arbitrary fractal

charge distribution.

If we consider the stationary spherically symmetric fractal distribution ρ(r, t) = ρ(r), and

the ball region W = {r :

|r| ≤ R}, then we have

where c3(D, r) is deﬁned in Eq. (2), i.e.,

Q(W ) = 4π

R

Q(W ) = 4π

Using the sphere S = {r :

|r| = R} as a surface S = ∂W , we get

ΦE(∂W ) = 4πR2E(R).

Substituting Eqs. (12) and (13) in Gauss’s law (10), we get the equation for electric ﬁeld.

As a result, Gauss’s law for fractal distribution with spherical symmetry leads us to the

equation for electric ﬁeld

For example, the electric ﬁeld of homogeneous (ρ(r) = ρ) spherically symmetric fractal

distribution is deﬁned by

E(R) =

IV. MAGNETIC FIELD OF FRACTAL DISTRIBUTION

A. Magnetic ﬁeld and Biot-Savart law

The Biot-Savart law relates magnetic ﬁelds to the currents which are their sources. In

a similar manner, Coulomb’s law relates electric ﬁelds to the point charges which are their

8

(14)

(15)

sources. Finding the magnetic ﬁeld resulting from a fractal current distribution involves the

vector product and is inherently a fractional calculus problem when the distance from the

current to the ﬁeld point is continuously changing.

For a continuous distribution the Biot-Savart law in MKS has the form

where [ , ] is a vector product, J is the current density, µ0 is the permeability of free space.

The fractional generalization of Eq. (14) for a fractal distribution in MKS has the form

B(r) =

µ0
4π ZW

[J(r′), r − r′]
|r − r′|3

dV ′
3,

B(r) =

µ0
4π ZW

[J(r′), r − r′]
|r − r′|3

dV ′
D.

This equation can be considered as Biot-Savart law written for a steady current with fractal

distribution of electric charges. The Biot-Savart law (15) can be used to ﬁnd the magnetic

ﬁeld produced by any fractal distribution of steady currents.

B. Ampere’s law for fractal distribution

The magnetic ﬁeld in space around an electric current is proportional to the electric

current which serves as its source, just as the electric ﬁeld in space is proportional to the

charge which serves as its source. In the case of static electric ﬁeld, the line integral of the

magnetic ﬁeld around a closed loop is proportional to the electric current ﬂowing through the

loop. The Ampere’s law is equivalent to the steady state of the integral Maxwell equation

in free space, and relates the spatially varying magnetic ﬁeld B(r) to the current density

J(r).

Note that, as mentioned by Lutzen in his article [21], Liouville, who was one of pioneers

in development of fractional calculus, was inspired by the problem of fundamental force law

in Ampbre’s electrodynamics and used fractional diﬀerential equation in that problem.

Let be a closed path around a current. Ampere’s law states that the line integral of the

magnetic ﬁeld B along the closed path L is given in MKS by

where dl is the diﬀerential length element, and µ0 is the permeability of free space. For the

fractal distribution of charged particles, we use

(B, dl) = µ0I(S),

IL

I(S) =

(J, dSd),

ZS

9

where dSd = c2(d, r)dS2.

If we consider the cylindrically symmetric fractal distribution, we have

where c2(d, r) is deﬁned in Eq. (4), i.e.,

Using the circle L = ∂W = {r :

|r| = R}, we get

I(S) = 2π

As a result, Ampere’s law for fractal distribution with cylindrical symmetry leads us to the

equation for magnetic ﬁeld

For example, the magnetic ﬁeld B(r) of homogeneous (J(r) = J0) fractal distribution is

deﬁned by

B(R) = J0

Rd−1 ∼ Rd−1.

V. FRACTIONAL INTEGRAL MAXWELL EQUATIONS

The Maxwell equations are the set of fundamental equations governing electromagnetism

(i.e., the behavior of electric and magnetic ﬁelds). The equations that can be expressed in

integral form are known as Gauss’s law, Faraday’s law, the absence of magnetic monopoles,

and Ampere’s law with displacement current. In MKS, these become

Let us consider the special case such that the ﬁelds are deﬁned on fractal [22] only.

The hydrodynamic and thermodynamics ﬁelds can be deﬁned in the fractal media [4, 11].

Suppose that the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be deﬁned on fractal as an approximation of

some real case with fractal medium. If the electric ﬁeld E(r) and magnetic ﬁeld B(r) can

be deﬁned on fractal and does not exist outside of fractal in Eucledian space E3, then we

must use the fractional generalization of the integral Maxwell equations in the form

(E, dSd) =

(E, dlγ) = −

These fractional integral equations have unusual properties. Note that fractional integrals

are considered as an approximation of integrals on fractals [17, 18].

Using the fractional generalization of Stokes’s and Gauss’s theorems (see Appendix), we

can rewrite the fractional integral Maxwell equations in the form

11

Note that the law of absence of magnetic monopoles for the fractal leads us to the equation

div(c2(d, r)B) = 0. This equation can be rewritten in the form

divB = −(B, gradc2(d, r)).

In the general case (d 6= 2), the vector grad (c2(d, r)) is not equal to zero and the magnetic

ﬁeld satisﬁes divB 6= 0.

If d = 2, we have div(F) 6= 0 only for nonsolenoidal ﬁeld F.

Therefore the magnetic ﬁeld on the fractal is similar to the nonsolenoidal ﬁeld. As a result,

the magnetic ﬁeld on fractal can be considered as a ﬁeld with some ”fractional magnetic

monopole” qm ∼ (B, ∇c2).

VI. MULTIPOLE MOMENTS FOR FRACTAL DISTRIBUTION

A. Electric multipole expansion

A multipole expansion is a series expansion of the eﬀect produced by a given system in

terms of an expansion parameter which becomes small as the distance away from the system

increases. Therefore, the leading one of the terms in a multipole expansion are generally

the strongest. The ﬁrst-order behavior of the system at large distances can therefore be

obtained from the ﬁrst terms of this series, which is generally much easier to compute than

the general solution. Multipole expansions are most commonly used in problems involving

the gravitational ﬁeld of mass aggregations, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of charge and

current distributions, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves.

To compute one particular case of a multipole expansion, let R = Xkek be the vector from

a ﬁxed reference point to the observation point, r = xkek be the vector from the reference

point to a point in the body, and d = R − r be the vector from a point in the body to the

observation point. The law of cosines then yields

B. Electric dipole moment of fractal distribution

An electric multipole expansion is a determination of the voltage U due to a collection

of charges obtained by performing a multipole expansion. This corresponds to a series

expansion of the charge density ρ(r) in terms of its moments, normalized by the distance

to a point R far from the charge distribution. In MKS, the electric multipole expansion is

given by Eq. (16):

where Pn(cos θ) is a Legendre polynomial and θ is the polar angle, deﬁned such that

The ﬁrst term arises from P0(x) = 1, while all further terms vanish as a result of Pn(x)

being a polynomial in x for n ≥ 1, giving Pn(0) = 0 for all n ≥ 1.

VII. CONCLUSION

(33)

In this paper, we have introduced and described the fractional continuous model for the

fractal distribution of charged particles. Using the fractional calculus and the fractional

continuous model, we have shown that the fractional integrals can be used for calculation

of multipole moments of the fractal distribution. The order of fractional integral is equal to

the fractal dimension of the distribution.

The fractional continuous models for fractal distribution of particles may have applica-

tions in plasma physics. This is due in part to the relatively small numbers of parameters that

deﬁne a fractal distribution of great complexity and rich structure. The fractional generaliza-

tion of integral Maxwell equations may have applications in the analysis of electrodynamical

18

problems involving the fractal stuctures. Therefore, it is interesting to numerically solve the

fractional equations for charged fractals. The fractional continuous model can be used to

describe dynamics and kinetics of the fractal distribution in the plasma physics. Extension

of this model to describe the dynamical properties of fractal distribution by fractional gen-

eralization of magnetohydrodynamics and Vlasov equations is currently under study by the

author.

where the vector J(r, t) = Jkek is a ﬁeld, and div(J) = ∂J/∂r = ∂Jk/∂xk. Here and later

Note that we have c2(2, r) = 1 for the d = 2. Using the usual Gauss’s theorem, we get

B. Cantor set and fractional continuous model

In the paper, we mention the diﬀerence between the real fractal medium structures and

replacing it by a fractional continuous mathematical model. Some quantitative measure of

the diﬀerence would be helpful. Note that the diﬀerence between the real fractal media and

fractional continuous medium model has an analog of the diﬀerence between the real atomic

structure of the media and the usual continuous medium models of these media. In order to

have some quantitative measure of the applicability of fractional continuous medium model,

we can consider the power law for fractal media. The fractal distribution of charged particles

is characterized by the law Q([0, R]) ∼ RD [22].

The Cantor set is given by taking the interval [0; x], removing the open middle third,

removing the middle third of each of the two remaining pieces, and continuing this procedure

ad inﬁnitum. The Cantor set is sometimes also called no middle third set.

In Fig. 1, we consider the charge y = Q([0, x]) of fractal distribution. The fractal

distribution is described by the Cantor set with fractal dimension D = ln(2)/ ln(3) [22].

The continuous model for the charge distribution is described by the continuous line y = xD

In Fig. 2, we consider the diﬀerence between the charge y = Q([0, x]) of fractal distri-

bution and the charge that is described by fractional continuous distribution in the interval

in the interval x ∈ [0, 30].

x ∈ [0, 30].

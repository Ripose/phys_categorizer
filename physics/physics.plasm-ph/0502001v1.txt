Hysteresis and the onset of fast magnetic reconnection

P. A. Cassak, M. A. Shay, and J. F. Drake

(Dated: September 11, 2013)

The transition between resistive (slow) and Hall-mediated (fast) magnetic reconnection with vary-
ing resistivity is elucidated using basic theoretical arguments and supported by two-ﬂuid numerical
simulations. We show that, for intermediate values of the resistivity, the reconnection is bistable.
We map the hysteresis curve and demonstrate that the transition from slow to fast reconnection
is catastrophic. We present a scaling analysis for the resistivities at which transitions occur and
propose that the transition is a possible mechanism for reconnection onset in physical systems.

PACS numbers: 52.35.Vd, 52.65.-y

Magnetic reconnection is vastly diﬀerent depending on
the collisionality of the system in question. For high col-
lisionality, resistive reconnection is slow and is marked by
a long, thin current layer [1, 2], whereas collisionless re-
connection is fast and is marked by a short current layer
with a wide outﬂow nozzle [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Previous
theoretical investigations of magnetic reconnection have
concentrated exclusively on one of the two regimes. In
this letter, we discuss the transition between the two as
the collisionality of the system is varied.

This transition is important for understanding the on-
set of reconnection in systems where plasma resistivity η
is ﬁnite, yet transitions to fast reconnection, where resis-
tivity is unlikely to be important, are observed. Exam-
ples are reconnection events in laboratory fusion experi-
ments and eruptions in the solar corona.

For a given plasma resistivity, rather general argu-
ments suggest that there are two solutions (fast and slow)
to the reconnection problem, i.e., there is bistability. The
Sweet-Parker solution [1, 2] governing slow reconnection
is valid provided the half width of the current layer δ
exceeds the relevant kinetic scale lengths,

vth,i is the ion thermal speed, B and n are the mag-
netic ﬁeld and ion density. The magnetic ﬁeld is to
be evaluated immediately upstream of the current layer.
The converse condition, that resistivity be suﬃciently
small to not impact the whistler or kinetic Alfv´en dy-
namics that drive kinetic reconnection [9], yields a dif-
ferent condition on resistivity, which can also be es-
timated. The whistler dispersion relation is given by

terms scale like k2, dissipation can only dominate if it is

This occurs when the electron-ion collision frequency,

a condition which is not typically satisﬁed in nature.
Thus, at intermediate collisionalities where Eq. (1) is
satisﬁed but Eq. (2) is not, there are two reconnection
solutions.

The presence of two solutions suggests that the transi-
tion between the two states could be catastrophic rather
than smooth. In a catastrophic transition between two
states, a small change in a control parameter induces
a discontinuous jump in the state of the system. Re-
searchers studying solar eruptions [10] and sawtooth
crashes [11] have been attempting to develop a catas-
trophic onset model. The present work,
in contrast
to these models, suggests that a catastrophic transition
from slow to fast reconnection could occur dynamically
through a decrease in the resistivity past a critical value

could compress the current sheet to a width below the
relevant kinetic scale. Either mechanism could produce
the explosive onset of fast reconnection seen in nature
and laboratory experiments.

∼

Before estimating the resistivities at which transitions
between slow and fast reconnection occur, let us recall
some salient properties of the two disparate regimes of
reconnection, namely resistive and collisionless. For pure
resistive reconnection [1, 2], the outﬂow speed vout scales
like the upstream ion Alfv´en speed, cA. Conservation of
mass forces δ/L
vin/vout, where vin is the inﬂow speed.
The inﬂow speed is estimated by balancing the diﬀusion
of the magnetic ﬁeld across the sheet, ηc2/4πδ2, with con-
vection across the sheet, vin/δ, which yields Eq. (1) with
vin
cAδ/L. Simulations have demonstrated that the
length L of the current layer is macroscopic [12, 13, 14].
The reconnection electric ﬁeld E
vinB/c, which is the
rate at which ﬂux reconnects, is proportional to vin. For
physical systems of interest, the resistivity is exceedingly
small, so the reconnection rate is small, implying that
resistive reconnection is slow.

Non-MHD Hall eﬀects greatly enhance the rate of re-
connection.
In a two-ﬂuid model with electron inertia
breaking the frozen-in condition, the ions decouple from
the electrons at the ion inertial length scale di. The elec-
trons become demagnetized at the electron inertial length
scale de. The outﬂow is driven by the whistler wave and
cAe = B/√4πnme, which is the electron Alfv´en

velocity evaluated immediately upstream of the electron
current sheet (as opposed to the ion current sheet) [15]. It
was found in a series of numerical simulations [4] that the
inﬂow speed is on the order of vin,e

We now present a scaling argument for the resistivi-
ties at which transitions between these two reconnection
conﬁgurations occur. First, consider the inﬂuence of the
Hall eﬀect on Sweet-Parker reconnection in a slow-to-
fast transition. When the resistivity falls below a critical
value ηsf , the width of the Sweet-Parker layer will fall be-
low di, invalidating the model. From Eq. (1), this occurs

Second, for the fast-to-slow transition, we explore the
magnitude of the resistivity ηf s required to disrupt the
electron current layer that develops during Hall driven re-
connection. As in the Sweet-Parker analysis, we balance

dition as νf s
0.1Ωce, which is consistent with Eq. (2).
The factor 0.1 in Eq. (4) yields the quantitatively correct
transition condition. This value of νf s is independent of
system size and is enormous for most physical systems.
Equation (4) suggests that once fast reconnection onsets,
resistive eﬀects are unlikely to inﬂuence the dynamics.

The results in Eq. (3) and (4) suggest that the region of
bistability spans an enormous range of resistivity, namely

slow reconnection occur at much higher resistivities than
the reverse, so there are two solutions to the reconnection
problem for a large range of resistivity.

These theoretical predictions are tested with numeri-
cal simulations using the two-ﬂuid code, f3d, a massively
parallel code described elsewhere [17]. For simplicity, we
treat an isothermal plasma. The simulations are two di-
mensional with a slab geometry, of length Lx in the x di-
rection and Ly in the y direction. The initial equilibrium
is two Harris sheets, B = ˆxB0 tanh[(y
Ly/4)/w0] with
w0 = 2di, conﬁgured in a double tearing mode conﬁgura-
tion with periodic boundary conditions in all directions.
The ions are initially stationary and initial pressure bal-
ance is enforced by a non-uniform density. A perturba-
tion is imposed on the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld of the
form

We use small fourth-order dissipation to damp waves at
the grid scale. The Hall, electron inertia, and resistive
terms can be enabled and disabled at will. For these
simulations, when the Hall eﬀect is enabled, the electron
inertia term is also enabled.

The computational domain must be chosen large
enough to have a sizable separation of scales between
the resistive and Hall-mediated reconnection rates, but
with resolution high enough to resolve the electron in-
ertial scales. We ﬁnd that a computational domain

tems would produce greater separations of ηsf and ηf s
but are more computationally challenging.

For this computational domain, we can estimate the
critical resistivities ηsf and ηf s. In evaluating Eq. (3), we
take the steady state (Sweet-Parker) total current sheet
length 2L to be Lx/2 (i.e., L
102.4di) because the
dominant unstable mode is the longest wavelength mode.
Then, normalizing lengths to di and velocities to cA0 =

sheet, we obtain

For the ﬁrst set of numerical simulations, we take η′ =

data has been smoothed with a fourth order algorithm.
The rate of reconnection remains nearly constant with

In the second set of simulations, we run a pure re-

tion of the Hall term, the reconnection stays quite near

The out of plane current density, Jz, is shown in Fig. 2
at late times for the runs corresponding to the two dashed
curves in Fig. 1 (for which both have the same param-
eters). In the top plot (fast reconnection), the current
sheet is short and opens wide, as is expected in Hall-
mediated reconnection. In the bottom plot (slow recon-
nection), the current sheet is long and thin as in Sweet-
Parker theory. Since the same equations govern the two
sets of data, we conclude that there is bistability, and
hence, hysteresis.

Finally, we map the hysteresis curve by ﬁnding the
steady state reconnection rate, E′, for values of resistivity

other than 0.015 for both of the previous conﬁgurations.
For the fast branch, we repeat the runs adding a non-zero
−1
resistivity to Hall reconnection (at t = 409.5Ω
ci ), but in-
stead use values of η′ of 0.010, 0.020, 0.025 and 0.030. For
the slow branch, rather than starting from t = 0 with dif-
ferent resistivities, we simply change the resistivity (when
−1
ci ) for the slow reconnection run
w
with η′ = 0.015 and the Hall eﬀect already introduced.
We use resistivities of η′ = 0.003, 0.007, 0.011, 0.013,
0.020, 0.025 and 0.030 and evolve the system until it
reaches a new steady state. The steady state reconnec-
tion rate, E′, is computed as the average reconnection
rate over time once transients have died away.

The results are plotted in Fig. 3(a), with the fast
branch plotted as open circles and the slow branch plot-
ted as closed circles. The closed circles reveal that the
transition from slow to fast reconnection occurs abruptly
between η′ of 0.011 and 0.013. The open circles reveal a
(not so abrupt) transition from fast to slow between η′ of
0.020 and 0.025. The error bars are due to the random
ﬂuctuations in the steady state reconnection rate. Thus,
we see a region of bistability, as expected, and the simula-
tion results show excellent agreement with the scaling law
predictions of η′
0.03. Fig. 3(b) shows
the current sheet width, δ, deﬁned as the half width at
half maximum of Jz(y) at the X-line, for each of the
above runs. As predicted by the scaling argument, the
Sweet-Parker current sheet width, δ, is of order di when
the transition to fast reconnection occurs, as is shown by
the closed circles. Note, the largest resistivity points on
the fast branch, at η′ = 0.025 and 0.030, do not relax
to the same Sweet-Parker conﬁguration as in the slow
branch because, for early times, they are run with zero
resistivity while the slow branch contains a non-zero re-
sistivity, so that some ﬂux is dissipated away on the slow
branch. Therefore, the conﬁgurations are not identical.

The eﬀect of collisionality on the reconnection rate
was explored in the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment
(MRX) [20]. A sharp increase in the reconnection rate
was observed at low collisionality. Data for the current
sheet width are unavailable, so further comparisons are
not possible.

To summarize, we have demonstrated that both resis-
tive and Hall-mediated reconnection solutions exist si-
multaneously over a signiﬁcant range of resistivity. For
values of resistivity such that the Sweet-Parker current
sheet width is greater than the relevant kinetic length
scale (di or ρs) but does not destroy the electron current
sheet, either mechanism can dominate reconnection, de-
pending on the history of the system. A corollary to this
result is that if a system is undergoing slow resistive re-
connection, a decrease in the resistivity below the critical
resistivity is accompanied by an abrupt transition to fast
reconnection. Alternately, a large perturbation which re-
duces the current sheet width of a Sweet-Parker current
sheet below the appropriate kinetic scale would presum-
ably also induce a transition to fast reconnection. These
scenarios present possible mechanisms for the explosive
onset of magnetic reconnection in physical systems. An
estimate of the critical temperature in the solar corona
agrees rather well with the coronal temperature, but a
similar estimate for the sawtooth crash is too small.

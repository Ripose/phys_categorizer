A kinetic equation for dust particles with a new kinetic variable - the mass of grains - is
suggested for the description of processes with changing mass in dusty plasmas and neutral
systems.

I. Introduction

The kinetic theory of dusty plasmas, which takes into account speciﬁc processes of charging,
has been considered in many papers, but usually not from ﬁrst principles. In [1] the dust charge
was introduced as a new dynamic variable for the kinetic equation, in [2,3] collision integrals for
dusty plasmas with charging have been formulated and used for several applications. The form
of the charging collision integrals suggested in [2,3] has been recently rigorously justiﬁed in [4,5],
where also the stationary velocity and charge distributions for dusty plasmas were established.
In this report we consider the generalized kinetic equation in which a new dynamic variable -
the mass of dust particles - is introduced in parallel with the charge variable. We will show
that for models of dusty plasmas with absorption of ions and electrons the distribution func-
tion of grains and the average kinetic energy are determined not only by momentum transfer
from light plasma particles to dust particles, but essentially (on the same time scale) also by
mass transfer. This statement also agrees with the preliminary results of MD simulations of
the heating of dust particles in plasma [6]. A simpliﬁed form of the obtained kinetic equation
(the nonstationary variant of the Fokker-Planck equation with changing mass) is also found
and the simplest concrete applications are considered. For some more complicated situations
with surface chemical reactions between electrons and ions absorbed by dust particles, when
atoms appear and can return from the dust to plasma, the processes of mass transfer can also
be essential. It is necessary to emphasize that the formulated equation can be important for
diﬀerent applications not only for plasmas, but for other systems with mesoscopic particles,
where processes with mass transfer take place.

II. Kinetic equation for dust particles with mass and charge variables

Let us introduce the generalized kinetic equation in which a new dynamic variable M - the

mass of dust particles is included in parallel with the charge Q:

dfD(t)

dt

= JD(~p, ~r, t, Q, M) + J c
D,

(1)

where the collision integral J c
D describes all collision processes without change of number of
small particles (e.g. electrons and ions in plasmas) and without change of mass and charge of

grains. The collision integral JD describes the absorption of mass and charge by dust particles.
For the simple model of absorption of electrons and ions with masses mα and charges eα by a
grain with charge Q we can write:

JD = Xα=(e,i)

Z d~pfα(~p, ~r, t)(ωα(~p, ~P − ~p, Q − eα, M − mα)fD( ~P − ~p, ~r, t, Q − eα, M − mα)

−ωα(~p, ~P , Q, M)fD( ~P , ~r, t, Q, M)).

(2)

where ωα(~p, ~P , Q, M) = υσα(υ, Q, M) is the probability density of absorption of an electron
or ion with momentum ~p and charge eα by a grain with momentum ~P and charge Q. This
collision integral implies that the processes of mass transfer from grains back to the plasma are
absent. If there are such type of processes the more complicated equations can be written to
take into account the mass balance in plasmas correctly. The simplest approximation for the
cross-section of absorption σα can be chosen in the usual form (see e.g.
[3]). In general the
cross-section can be some function of the mass of grains (for example due to the dependence
of the grain’s radius on mass). In general the necessity to include the mass as a new kinetic
variable depends, naturally, on the time scale, under consideration. To simplify the problem we
have to expand the collision integrals using the small parameters mα
Q . We also suggest
here that P ≫ p. Then we can ﬁnd the generalized Fokker-Planck equation for grains, which
will be nonstationary in our case, due in particular to mass absorption. In this paper we will
realize this expansion for a neutral system: neutral grains in system of small neutral particles.
Simpliﬁcation of Eq.1 and Eq.2 for plasmas is similar and will be published separately.

III. Kinetics of neutral grains due to mass absorption collisions

For neutral homogeneous systems we can rewrite Eq.2 in the form

JD(P, M, t) = Z d~pfn(~p, t)(w(~p, ~P − ~p, M − m)fD( ~P − ~p, M − m, t)

(3)

Here w(p, P, M) = σ(M)| ~P

After expansion up to ﬁrst order in mα

Below we will suggest that fn(p, t) = fn(p) is stationary Maxwell distribution for small

particles with temperature T0 and density n0. Then we ﬁnd:

j0 =

jǫ = 2mT0j0.

Let us consider some average functions: density nD, mass of grain < M > and

Uab(λ) =< pa

nD =

Then we ﬁnd:

The question arises whether stationary averages in the limit t → ∞ are possible. For
example for the average kinetic energy of grains E(t) = U21(2) we ﬁnd, as follows from Eq.9,
the stationary solution in the limit t → ∞ in the case σ(M) ∼ M (σ ≡ σ′

0M):

(10)

We emphasize that if we formally omit the last term in Eq.4, describing change of the mass
M, the stationary Maxwell distribution function for grains with the temperature TD = 2T0 can
be immediately found. This result coincides with the solution obtained in [4] for the limit of
uncharged particles. Really the omitted term is of the same order as other terms in Eq.4, as
shown above. Nevertheless the physical results and predictions obtained in [4] can be realized
if the physical process of transfer of atoms from the surface of dust particles to the plasma
take a place and is included in the kinetic theory. In this case the mass of dust particles can
be ﬁxed due to this process. A more detailed analysis of the problem of stationary averages
in the limit t → ∞ for neutral systems and dusty plasmas in parallel with the consideration
of the nonstationary solutions of Eq.4 for diﬀerent cases, in particular, of such as (for the case
σ(M) =const):

fD(P, M, t) = ϕ(t −

and some others, including the solutions of generalized Fokker-Planck equation for dusty plas-
mas, will be presented separately.

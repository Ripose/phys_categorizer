Quasi-crystals formed by charged mesoscopic dust grains (dust lattices), observed since hardly a
decade ago, are an exciting paradigm of a nonlinear chain. In laboratory discharge experiments,
these quasi-lattices are formed spontaneously in the sheath region near a negative electrode, usually
at a levitated horizontal equilibrium conﬁguration where gravity is balanced by an electric ﬁeld. It
is long known (and experimentally conﬁrmed) that dust-lattices support linear oscillations, in the
longitudinal (acoustic mode) as well as in the transverse, in plane (acoustic-) or oﬀ-plane (optic-like
mode) directions. Either due to the (typically Yukawa type) electrostatic inter-grain interaction
forces or to the (intrinsically nonlinear) sheath environment, nonlinearity is expected to play an
important role in the dynamics of these lattices. Furthermore, the coupling between the diﬀerent
modes may induce coupled nonlinear modes. Despite this evidence, the elucidation of the nonlinear
mechanisms governing dust crystals is in a rather preliminary stage. In this study, we derive a set
of (coupled) discrete equations of motion for longitudinal and transverse (out-of-plane) motion in a
one dimensional model chain of charged dust grains. In a continuum approximation, i.e. assuming
a variation scale which is larger than the lattice constant, one obtains a set of coupled modiﬁed
Boussinesq-like equations. Diﬀerent nonlinear solutions of the coupled system are discussed, based
on localized travelling wave ans¨atze and on coupled equations for the envelopes of co-propagating
quasi-linear waves.

INTRODUCTION

Recent studies of various collective processes in dust contaminated plasmas (DP) [1] have been of signiﬁcant interest
in relation with linear and nonlinear waves which are observed in laboratory and space plasmas. An issue of particular
importance is the formation of strongly coupled DP crystals by highly charged dust grains, for instance in the sheath
region above a horizontal negatively biased electrode in experiments [1, 2]. Low-frequency oscillations may occur in
these mesoscopic dust grain quasi-lattices, in both longitudinal (acoustic mode) [3] and transverse (in-plane shear
acoustic mode, oﬀ-plane optic-like mode) directions, as theoretically predicted and experimentally observed (see in
Ref. [1] for a review).

In this paper, we focus on the nonlinear description of dust grain displacements in a one-dimensional dust crystal,
which is suspended in a levitated horizontal equilibrium position where gravity and electric (or, possibly magnetic [4])
forces balance each other. Considering the coupling between the horizontal (∼ ˆx) and vertical (oﬀ-plane, ∼ ˆz) degrees
of freedom, and an arbitrary inter-grain interaction potential form U (r) (e.g. Debye or else) and sheath potential
Φ(z) (not necessary parabolic), we aim in deriving a set of equations which should serve as a basis for forthcoming
studies of the nonlinear behaviour of longitudinal and transverse dust lattice waves (LDLWs, TDLWs) propagating
in these crystals. The relation to recent studies of a similar scope (here recovered as special cases) is also discussed.

II. THE MODEL

Let us consider a layer of charged dust grains (mass M and charge q, both assumed constant for simplicity) of

lattice constant r0. The Hamiltonian of such a chain is of the form

where rn is the position vector of the n−th grain; Unm(rnm) ≡ q φ(x) is a binary interaction potential function related
to the electrostatic potential φ(x) around the m−th grain, and rnm = |rn − rm| is the distance between the n−th and
m−th grains. The external potential Φext(r) accounts for the external force ﬁelds in which the crystal is embedded;
in speciﬁc, Φext takes into account the forces acting on the grains (and balancing each other at equilibrium, ensuring
stability) in the vertical direction (i.e. gravity, electric and/or magnetic forces); it may also include the parabolic
horizontal conﬁnement potential imposed in experiments for stability [5] as well as, for completeness, the initial laser
excitation triggering the oscillations in experiments.

A. 2d equation of motion

Considering the motion of the n−th dust grain in both the longitudinal (horizontal, ∼ ˆx) and the transverse (vertical,
oﬀ–plane, ∼ ˆz) directions (i.e. suppressing the transverse in-plane – shear – component, ∼ ˆx), so that rn = (xn, zn),
we have the two-dimensional (in x, z) equation of motion

where Ej (x) = −∂φ(r)/∂xj is the (interaction) electrostatic ﬁeld and Fext,j = −∂Φext(x)/∂xj accounts for all external
forces in the j− direction (j = 1/2 for xj = x/z); the usual ad hoc damping term was introduced in the left-hand-side
of Eq. (1), involving the damping rate ν due to dust–neutral collisions.

B. Nonlinear vertical conﬁning potential

We shall assume a smooth, continuous variation of the (generally inhomogeneous) ﬁeld intensities E and/or B, as
well as the grain charge q (which may vary due to charging processes) near the equilibrium position z0 = 0. Thus, we
may develop

III. DISCRETE EQUATIONS OF MOTION

Assuming small displacements from equilibrium, one may Taylor expand the interaction potential energy U (r)
around the equilibrium inter-grain distance lr0 = |n − m|r0 (between l−th order neighbors, l = 1, 2, ...), i.e. around
δxn ≈ 0 and δzn ≈ 0, viz.

(zn − zm)2]1/2 also needs to be expanded, i.e. near |xn − xm| = lr0 and zn − zm = 0, so that ∂U (r)/∂xj =

K1 = Φ(3)/(2M ) ,

Obviously, the prime denotes diﬀerentiation, viz. U ′′(r0) = d2U (r)/dr2
and so on. In the above equations of
motion, we have distinguished the linear contributions of the ﬁrst neighbors from the nonlinear ones, i.e. the ﬁrst
line in the right–hand–side from the remaining ones, in both equations. Note that all of the coeﬃcients are deﬁned in
such a way that they bear positive values for Debye–type interactions, i.e. if UD(r) = (q2/r) exp(−r/λD) (λD is the
eﬀective Debye length) since odd/even derivatives are then negative/positive; however, the sign of these coeﬃcients is
not a priori prescribed for a diﬀerent interaction potential U (r). Indeed, we insist on expressing all formulae in such a
manner that a diﬀerent interaction law may easily be assumed in a “plug–in” manner; in particular, even though the
Debye potential UD is widely accepted in DP crystal models, we think of the modiﬁcation of U when one takes into
account a magnetic ﬁeld [4] or the ion ﬂow towards the negative electrode [7]. Nevertheless, we provide the explicit
form of the coeﬃcients aij deﬁned above for a Debye potential, for clarity, in the Appendix.

Upon careful inspection of the discrete equations of motion above, one notices that the lowest order nonlinearity in
the longitudinal motion is due to the intergrain interaction law, while nonlinearity in the vertical motion is primarily
induced by the coupling to the horizontal component (and, to less extent, by interactions).

IV. CONTINUUM APPROXIMATION

Adopting the standard continuum approximation, we may assume that only small displacement variations occur

between neighboring sites, i.e.

∂2u
∂x2 ±
where the (horizontal) displacement δxn(t) is now expressed via a continuous function u = u(x, t). The analogous
continuous function w = w(x, t) is deﬁned for δzn(t).

One may now proceed by inserting this ansatz in the discrete equations of motion (4, 5), and carefully evaluating
the contribution of each term. The calculation, quite tedious yet perfectly straightforward, leads to a set of coupled

V. RELATION TO PREVIOUS RESULTS - DISCUSSION

As a matter of fact, all known older results are based on equations which are readily recovered, as special cases,
from Eqs. (4) and (5) and/or their continuum counterparts (9) and (10). In particular, the coupled Eqs. (1) and
(2) in Ref. [8] are exactly recovered from (4) and (5), upon neglecting a30, a12, K1 and K2 and then evaluating all
coeﬃcients for a Debye–type potential.

Upon switching oﬀ the coupling (i.e. setting w → 0), Eq. (9) above recovers exactly the nonlinear Eq. (13) in Ref.
[10], which was therein shown to model (nonlinear) longitudinal dust grain motion in terms of (either Korteweg-de
Vries– [3, 9] or Boussinesq–type) solitons; also see Eq. (2) in [11] (treating the formation of asymmetric envelope
modulated LDLWs) and Eq. (2) in [12] (keep only ﬁrst-neighbor interactions therein, to compare).
In a similar
manner, considering purely transverse motion (i.e.
(5) and (10) herein recover exactly the
nonlinear Eqs. (7) and (8) in Ref. [13], where they were shown to model the amplitude modulation of TDLWs which
is due to the sheath nonlinearity. Finally, needless to say, the linear limit recovers exactly the known equations of
motion for either purely longitudinal or purely transverse motion (i.e. considering aij = Kj = 0, ∀ i, j).

setting u → 0) Eqs.

An exact treatment of the coupled evolution Eqs. (4, 5) – or, at least, the continuum system (9, 10) – seems quite
a complex task to accomplish. Even though Eq. (9) may straightforward be seen as a Boussinesq–type equation [10],
which is now modiﬁed by the coupling, its transverse counterpart (10) (for u → 0, say) substantially diﬀers from
any known nonlinear model equation, bearing known exact solutions. Therefore, we shall limit ourselves to reporting
this system of evolution equations, for the ﬁrst time, thus keeping a more thorough investigation (analytical and/or
numerical) of their fully nonlinear regime for a later report.

VI. COUPLED-MODE MODULATED WAVE PACKETS

In order to gain some insight regarding the inﬂuence of the mode–coupling on the nonlinear proﬁle of the dust
lattice waves, we may consider the eﬀects which come into play when the amplitude of the LDLWs and the TDLWs –
which are initially uncoupled in the small amplitude (linear) limit – is increased to a slightly ﬁnite (i.e. non negligible)
value, thus allowing for a weak coupling between the two modes and a tractable appearance of the signature of the
(weak) nonlinearity in the dynamics.

6

The standard way for such an approach is via the introduction of multiple space and time scales, viz. X0, X1, X2, ...
and T0, T1, T2, ..., where Xn = ǫnx and Tn = ǫnt (ǫ ≪ 1 is a smallness parameter). The solutions are expanded as:
u = ǫu1 + ǫ2u2 + ... (plus an analogous expression for w). The technical details of the calculation are described e.g.
in [11] and will be omitted here. We shall apply this reductive perturbation technique to the system obtained from
Eqs. (9, 10) by keeping only the lowest-order nonlinear terms (i.e. omitting the last line in both equations); we set
p0 = 2a20r3
0 for simplicity. Note the inevitable (and qualitatively expected) complication of the
calculation due to the diﬀerent dispersion laws in the two modes [14].

0 and h0 = 2a02r3

The ﬁrst-order (∼ ǫ) equations are uncoupled and may be solved by assuming {u1, w1} = {ψ(0)

+[{ψL, ψT } exp i(kx − ωt) + c.c.] (complex conjugate). Upon substitution, we obtain ψ(0)

The 2nd-order (∼ ǫ2) equations contain secular (1st-harmonic forcing) terms, whose elimination imposes a pair of
conditions in the form: ∂Ψj/∂T1 + vg,j ∂Ψj/∂X1 = 0 (where j ∈ {1, 2} ≡ {L, T } in the following), implying that the
′(k) < 0 (the TDLW is
amplitudes Ψj travel at the (diﬀerent) group velocities vg,j ≡ ∂ωj(k)/∂k. See that vg,T = ωT
a backward wave), as immediately obtained from (11b). The remaining system is then solved for the 0th and the 2nd
harmonic amplitudes (in ǫ2) [14]; the solution ﬁnally obtained is of the form:

δxn(t) ≈ u(x, t) ≈ ǫ[ψ0 + ψ1 exp i(kx − ω1t) + c.c.] + ǫ2 u(2)
δzn(t) ≈ w(x, t) ≈ ǫ[ψ2 exp i(kx − ω2t) + c.c.] + ǫ2 {w(0)

where C is an integration constant (to be determined by the boundary conditions). The linear dispersion terms Pj
′′(k) (j = 1, 2); the group velocities vg,j
are related to the (curvature of) the dispersion relations (11) as Pj = ωj
were deﬁned above [15]. The nonlinearity coeﬃcients Qij (i = 0, 1, 2, j = 1, 2) and the ‘peculiar’ contributions Hj
(involving cross-terms in Ψ2
j ) are too lengthy to report here [14]. Observe that, once C is determined, one may cast
Eqs. (14) into the form of a (modiﬁed, asymmetric) system of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations (CNLSE).
Note that we have avoided the usual envelope (Galilean) transformation {x, t} → {x − vg,jt, t}, since it does not
simplify this (asymmetric, with respect to 1 ↔ 2) system. Finally, let us point out, for rigor, that the results in
[11] and [16] are exactly recovered, from both (13) and (14), in the appropriate – uncoupled mode – limits (namely,
Ψ2 → 0 and Ψ1 → 0, respectively, for LDLWs and TDLWs).

i Ψ∗

Despite the obvious analytical complication, the physical mechanism underlying the above results is rather trans-
parent. There is an energy pumping eﬀect between the zeroth-harmonic longitudinal (displacement) mode Ψ0, ﬁrst
put forward in [11] (for LDLWs, yet long known in solid state physics [17]) and the modulated (low-frequency) LDL
and (high-frequency) TDL mode(s). Note the strong misﬁt (asymmetry) between the dispersion laws dominating
the coupled modes, despite which – regretfully – no simplifying assumption may be analytically carried out in this
continuum model.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have put forward a comprehensive nonlinear model for coupled longitudinal-to-transverse displacements in a
horizontal dust mono-layer, levitated in a sheath under the inﬂuence of gravity and an electric and/or magnetic ﬁeld.
All of the above results are generic, i.e. valid for any assumed form of the inter-grain interaction potential U (r) and
the sheath potential Φ, and will hopefully contribute to the elucidation of the grain oscillatory dynamics in dust
crystals.

Appendix: Form of the coeﬃcients for the Debye interaction potential

Consider the Debye potential (energy) UD(r) = qφD(r) = q2 e−r/λD /r. Deﬁning the (positive real) lattice parameter

κ = r0/λD, one straightforward has

Of course, all known previous deﬁnitions of (some of) these coeﬃcients (for nearest neighbour interactions; see in the
references cited in the text) are exactly recovered. Note, ﬁnally, that κ is of the order of (or slightly higher than) unity
in experiments; therefore, all coeﬃcients turn out to be of similar order of magnitude, as one may check numerically.

[14] The tedious details are left to be reported in a lengthier report, in preparation.
[15] See that, once damping is taken into account (via ν 6= 0), all dispersion-related quantities – namely ωj, vg,j and Pj
(j = 1, 2 ≡ L, T ) here – bear an imaginary part. All of the corresponding expressions – readily obtained from Eq. (11)
and thus omitted here – were exactly recovered by the (tedious) algebra within our perturbative scheme; recall, in passing,
that Ψ0,1,2 are complex numbers, by deﬁnition.

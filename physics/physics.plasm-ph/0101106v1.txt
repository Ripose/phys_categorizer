We investigate the intermittency of magnetic turbulence
as measured in Reversed Field Pinch plasmas. We show that
the Probability Distribution Functions of magnetic ﬁeld dif-
ferences are not scale invariant, that is the wings of these
functions are more important at the smallest scales, a clas-
sical signature of intermittency. We show that scaling laws
appear also in a region very close to the external wall of the
conﬁnement device, and we present evidences that the ob-
served intermittency increases moving towards the wall.

The issue of self–similarity is of paramount importance
in turbulence studies. Indeed, self–similarity is one of the
key hypotheses of Kolmogorov theory [1,2], which leads
for ﬂuid turbulence to the famous
5/3 exponent for the
power spectrum decay in the inertial range (the interme-
diate range of scales between the large scales where en-
ergy is injected and the small ones where it is dissipated).
Notwithstanding the success of the Kolmogorov’s the-
ory, the study of the Probability Distribution Functions
(PDF) of velocity ﬂuctuations at a given scale has shown
a departure from gaussianity in the PDF tails. The same
phenomenon is usually evidenced by looking at the scal-
ing exponents of higher order moments of ﬂuctuations,
which appear to be nonlinear functions of the order in-
dex. Intermittency described by multifractal models [2]
is usually invoked to be the cause of the observed break of
pure self–similarity. Even if Kolmogorov theory was orig-
inally developed for homogeneous and isotropic turbu-
lence, the evidence for self–aﬃne ﬁelds has been studied
also inside the boundary layer turbulence in ﬂuid labo-
ratory experiments [3] which is neither homogeneous nor
isotropic. The only hypothesis required to perform these
studies from an experimental point of view, in order to
apply the usual Taylor’s hypothesis, is the statistical sta-
tionarity of turbulence. Recently it has been shown [4]
that only after a suitable decomposition in terms of ir-
reducible representations of the SO(3) groups one can
hope to properly disentangle isotropic from anisotropic
eﬀects in Navier–Stokes equations. Of course this should
be true also in MHD ﬂows, even if it is not clear how
to recover anisotropic and non homogeneous eﬀects from
real data.

While in ordinary ﬂuids the statistical properties of
turbulence have been well characterized, both theoreti-

1

cally and experimentally, in magnetized ﬂuids only re-
cently this has been undertaken, mostly in relation with
velocity and magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations measured in the
solar wind [5].
In this paper we report evidences for
the presence of intermittency in another type of mag-
netized ﬂuid, namely a plasma of interest for controlled
thermonuclear fusion research, conﬁned in reversed ﬁeld
pinch (RFP) conﬁguration.

The RFP is a conﬁguration of magnetic ﬁelds [6] char-
acterized by toroidal and poloidal components of com-
parable magnitude (in a tokamak the ﬁeld is mainly
toroidal). The conﬁguration represents a near-minimum
energy state to which a plasma relaxes under proper con-
straints [7]. The toroidal ﬁeld changes sign in the outer
part of the plasma, a feature which gives the name to
the conﬁguration. Such ﬁeld reversal, which improves
the MHD stability of the conﬁguration, is spontaneously
generated by the plasma, and is maintained against resis-
tive diﬀusion by the dynamo process [8]. This is achieved
through the action and nonlinear coupling of several re-
sistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes, which give
rise to a high level of magnetic turbulence (of the order
of 1% of the average ﬁeld in present day experiments,
i.e. two orders of magnitude larger than in tokamaks).
This high ﬂuctuation level makes the RFP very suited
for the study of MHD turbulence properties, mainly for
their magnetic part. The magnetic turbulence has been
demonstrated to be the main cause of energy and par-
ticle transport in the RFP core, whereas at the edge its
contribution is still under investigation.
In this region
the electrostatic turbulence has been proved to give an
important contribution to the particle transport [9]. It
is worth mentioning that a recent investigation of the
edge electrostatic turbulence in diﬀerent fusion devices
(including RFP and tokamaks) has shown the existence
of long range time and space correlations [10].

The measurements described in this paper have been
obtained in the RFX experiment, which is the largest
RFP presently in operation (major radius 2 m, minor ra-
dius 0.457 m) [11]. RFX is designed to reach a plasma
current of 2 MA, and currents up to 1 MA have been ob-
tained up to now. The measurements were performed in
low currents discharges (300 kA) using a magnetic probe
inserted in the edge plasma. The probe consists of a coil
housed in a boron nitride protecting head. The coil mea-
sures the time derivative ∂tB of the radial component
B(t) of the magnetic ﬁeld. The radial direction in this

case goes from the core plasma to the edge. The sampling
frequency of the measurements is 2 MHz. Measurements
have been collected at diﬀerent values of the normalized
radius r/a (r/a = 1 identiﬁes the location of the last
magnetic ﬂux surface) In RFX two diﬀerent components
of the magnetic ﬂuctuations can be identiﬁed: a localised
and stationary magnetic perturbation, originated by the
tearing modes responsible for the dynamo which tend to
be phase–locked and locked to the wall [12], and an high
frequency broadband activity, which is investigated here.
All measurements presented were made away from the
stationary perturbation.

We start by looking at the statistical properties of the
< (∂tB)2 > (brackets
normalized variables s(t) = ∂tB/
being time averages). In ﬁgure 1 we show the ﬂatness of
these stochastic variables f =< s4 > /[< s2 >]2 for some
positions r/a. As it can be seen f (r/a) is higher than
the gaussian value and tends to decrease as r/a increases.
This is a ﬁrst rough evidence that the observed magnetic
ﬁeld is intermittent, that is the time evolution of ∂tB is
dominated by strong magnetic ﬂuctuations. The inter-
mittency (say the departure from a gaussian statistics)
is more visible near the external wall.

is the parameter which deﬁnes the change of scale) leads
to

δB(λτ ) = λ

−hδB(τ )

This is interpreted as an “equality in law” [2], that is
the right–hand–side of the equation has the same sta-
tistical properties of left–hand–side. If h is constant we
can easily show that the PDFs of the normalized stochas-
< [δB(τ )]2 > collapse to a
tic variables δbτ = δB(τ )/
unique PDF, independent on the scale τ . This is true in a
p
pure self–similar (fractal) case. On the contrary we must
invoke the multifractal model to describe intermittency
[2] which is introduced by deﬁning a range of values of h.
In ﬁgure 2 we report the PDFs of δbτ at diﬀerent scales
for a given value of r/a. As it can be seen the PDFs do
not collapse to a single curve, but follow a characteristic
scaling behavior which is visible for all values of r/a. At
large scales the PDF are almost gaussian, and the wings
of the distributions grow up as the scale becomes smaller.
Stronger events at small scales have a probability of oc-
currence greater than that they would have if they were
distributed according to a gaussian function. This be-
havior, that is the presence of self–aﬃne ﬁelds, is at the
heart of the phenomenon of intermittency as currently
observed in ﬂuid ﬂows [2,14].

To get some insight into the nature of intermittency
actually present in the fusion device, following the usual
analysis currently made in ﬂuid ﬂows [2], we investigate
the scaling behavior of the stochastic variables δB(τ ) =
B(t + τ )
B(t), which represents characteristic ﬂuctua-
tions across turbulent structures at the scale τ . For each
position within the device, we can study the statistical
behavior of ﬂuctuations at diﬀerent scales τ . The interest
of this resides in the fact that, if we introduce a scaling

law for magnetic ﬂuctuations δB(τ )

The behavior of PDFs against the scale can be de-
scribed by introducing a given shape for the distribution.
At each scale τ the PDF of δbτ can be represented as a
convolution of gaussian functions of widths σ whose dis-
tribution is given by a function Gλ(σ)

three diﬀerent insertion r/a, namely: r/a = 0.97 (black cir-

A complementary analysis of intermittency can be per-
formed by calculating the scaling exponents of the struc-
ture functions, say of the p–th moments of ﬂuctuations

In ﬁgure 4 we report the structure functions S(p)

values of p, and for two diﬀerent position r/a. The dif-
ferences for diﬀerent position is evident, and represent a
signature of the absence of universality.

even if other functions does not give really diﬀerent re-
sults [14]. The free parameter λ2 represents the width of
the distribution Gλ, while σ0 is the most probable value
of σ. The scaling behavior of P (δbτ ) is translated in
the scaling variation of the parameter λ2 [14,16]. In fact
when the PDF is gaussian λ2 = 0 (Gλ becomes a delta
function centered around σ0), while the departure from
a gaussian function increases as λ2 increases. In ﬁgure 2
we report as full line a ﬁt of the data with equation (1).
A satisfactory agreement at all scales is evident.

Looking at the scaling laws for λ2, at diﬀerent insertion
points r/a, it can be seen (ﬁgure 3) that λ2 displays a
power law behavior

all over the observed time scales, for insertion points near
the external wall. On the contrary measurements more
inside the device show a saturation of intermittency at
10 µs. The values of β we ﬁnd are of the or-
scales τS

ﬁeld both in ﬂuid ﬂows and in the solar wind turbulence
[14,16], but higher than the value found for the magnetic
ﬁeld intensity in the solar wind [16]. Finally the absolute
values for λ2 are decreasing going from the wall inside
the device. Namely we found λ2
0.01 for
max = 0.21
r/a = 0.98, and λ2
0.006 for r/a = 0.84.
This is a further conﬁrmation of the stronger intermit-
tency near the external wall. All the error–bars has been
estimated starting from a poisson statistical uncertainity
on the PDFs value.

To calculate the scaling exponents, we use the gener-
alized scaling introduced by Benzi and coworkers [17],
which has been found to be useful also in magnetohydro-
dynamic turbulence [13,18], thus obtaining the normal-

ciated with ﬁeld reversal [22]. We are actually review-
ing and testing this idea on the RFX device in order to
identify structures which generate intermittency. Since a
reduction of magnetic ﬂuctuations has been linked to im-
provements in the energy conﬁnement [23], a better un-
derstanding of the generation of intermittency through
structures could improve the conﬁnement physics under-
standing.

FIG. 5. The normalized scaling exponents ζp of the struc-
ture functions are shown as a function of p, for diﬀerent inser-
tion points r/a. Errorbars, about 5% of the exponent values,
are not displayed for clarity. The K41 scaling ζp ∼ p/3 is also
reported for comparison.

In ﬁgure 5 we report the scaling exponents obtained
for some insertions r/a. The behavior of ζp against p
shows that scaling exponents are anomalous, say they
are diﬀerent from the usual p/3 Kolmogorov’s law. Note
once more that the strength of intermittency, measured
through the diﬀerence between ζp and p/3, is greater near
the wall. In conclusion scaling laws for PDFs of magnetic
ﬂuctuations, and anomalous scalings for structure func-
tions, are found everywhere in the outer plasma region
of the RFX thermonuclear fusion experiment. We ﬁnd
that the anomaly of scaling exponents, as well as scaling
laws for PDFs, strongly depend on the position inside the
plasma, so that magnetic turbulence inside the device is
not universal, as far as scaling laws are concerned. Pos-
sible reasons for this are the presence of the ﬁrst wall,
the presence of the toroidal ﬁeld reversal (which takes
place at r/a
0.9) or the strongly sheared plasma ﬂow
measured in the RFX edge [19]. Concerning this latter
option, it is worth to mention that in principle diﬀer-
ent plasma velocities in diﬀerent points would only aﬀect
the relationship between time and spatial scales obtained
through Taylor hypothesis, and not the PDF scaling
properties. However, the eddy breaking eﬀect induced
by a velocity shear is well known to aﬀect electrostatic
turbulence in fusion plasmas [20,9], and an inﬂuence on
MHD turbulence can also be envisaged, either directly
or thorugh nonlinear coupling to electrostatic modes. If
this is not the case, the reason for the observed diﬀer-
ences could be perhaps found in the conjecture of Farge
[21]. She proposed that turbulence could be described
by interwoven sets of both intermittent structures and
background gaussian ﬂow on each characteristic scale.
The nature of the intermittent structures can evidently
be inﬂuenced by walls [3], and/or current sheets asso-

The two-particle problem within a nonequilibrium many-particle system is investigated in the
framework of real-time Green’s functions. Starting from the dynamically screened ladder approx-
imation of the nonequlibrium Bethe-Salpeter equation, a nonequilibrium Dyson equation is given
for two-time two-particle Green’s functions. Thereby the well-known Kadanoﬀ-Baym equations are
generalized to the case of two-particle functions. The two-time structure of the equations is achieved
in an exact way avoiding the so-called Shindo approximation. For the case of thermodynamic equi-
librium, the diﬀerences to former results obtained for the eﬀective two-particle hamiltonian are
discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

This paper is devoted to the kinetic theory of many-particle systems which are able to form bound states. To
be speciﬁc, we will consider the case of two-particle bound states, i.e. the bound states are to be thought of, e.g.,
as hydrogen-like atoms or ions. Our focus will be the derivation of a kinetic equation for the distribution function
of the (possibly excited) bound states. Starting with papers of, for instance, Waldmann [1], Snider and Lowry
[2,3], McLennan and Lagan [4–6], Klimontovich and Kremp [7], the derivation of kinetic equations has appealed great
interest over many years. Usually (see, e.g. the review article of Klimontovich et al. [8]) the two-particle density matrix
is split up in diﬀerent parts with respect to some projection operator which projects onto the space of the bound
states. Often the states are taken to be those of the isolated atom. The diagonal matrix elements are considered
to be the distribution function for the respective bound state. However, in a dense system, it is not clear if the
diagonalization of the density matrix with respect to the unperturbed two-particle states is a good approximation.

It is well known that many-particle eﬀects like dynamical screening, self-energies or phase space occupation may
have an inﬂuence on the two-particle properties. A unique description of these eﬀects within the investigation of
nonequilibrium behaviour can be given in the framework of the real-time Green’s functions technique. For the single-
particle functions, this can be done with the Kadanoﬀ-Baym equations for the correlation functions g≷
a . In this paper
we aim on the derivation of similar equations on the two-particle level.

Some remarks on the bound state problem in equilibrium seem to be useful ﬁrst. The investigation of bound states
in dense systems, which are in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, has been the topic of a lot of papers, see the
references cited in the monographs [9] and [10]. In the framework of the Green’s functions method, a proper starting
point is the so-called Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-particle causal Green’s function [11–13]

The kernel of this integral equation Kab is a four point function.
In a diagrammatic language Kab comprises all
irreducible diagrams in the particle-particle channel. The eﬀective interaction Kab has a dynamical character. This
makes the structure complicate: although one is interested only in the two-particle Green’s function in the particle-
particle channel with t1 = t2 and t′
2, by the dynamical kernel K the knowledge of a Green’s function with three
times is enforced in the integral term. In Fourier space (or within the Matsubara technique), this is adequate to the
problem that, for the determination of the two-particle Green’s function dependent on one frequency, a more general
function dependent on two frequencies has to be known. A way out of this dilemma has been tried by applying
the Shindo approximation [14] in which the causal quantity with two frequencies is constructed from that with one
frequency. Then one gets a closed equation for the causal Green’s function. There are few estimations on the range

1 = t′

1

of validity of this approximation.
It has been argued that the
Shindo approximation reﬂects a ﬁrst order approximation with respect to the retardation of the eﬀective interaction
[15,10,16].

It is an exact relation for a static interaction K.

In order to evaluate the Bethe-Salpeter equation, one has, of course, to use some approximation for the eﬀective
interaction Kab. In the simplest one, which has a dynamical character, Kab is just the dynamically screened potential
V S
ab. We will come back to this point later.
With help of this Bethe-Salpeter equation, some important questions concerning the properties of two-particle states
in a plasma could be discussed. An eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation was derived which has some important corrections
in comparison with that for an isolated atom: (i) phase space occupation factors, (ii) exchange self-energies (Hartree-
Fock), (iii) a dynamically screened eﬀective potential and (iv) dynamical single-particle self-energy corrections. It has
been shown that for localized states there is to a large extent a compensation between the eﬀects (i) and (iii) on one
side and (ii) and (iv) on the other. It follows that the binding energies of (at least the low lying) bound states are
not changed considerably in comparison with the isolated atom. In contrast there is a large shift of the continuum
edge by the self-energy corrections. This results in a lowering of ionization energies with increasing plasma density
and leads, at the end, to the well-known Mott eﬀect. An eﬀective wave equation was solved numerically in [17,18],
for a discussion of the result see Kraeft [19].

However, the results obtained for the eﬀective Hamiltonian have also some serious shortcomings. There occurs a
division by Pauli-blocking factors 1 − fa − fb what causes spurious pole structures for highly degenerate systems.
Further, the eﬀective Hamiltonian has static contributions which lack a clear physical interpretation (see e.g. [20]).
These static parts vanish for a nondegenerate system.

An other approach has been given by Schuck and co-workers [21,22]. They postulate that Dyson equations exist
for two-time causal and retarded Green’s functions, respectively. Expressions for the self-energy operator (also called
mass operator or eﬀective Hamiltonian) are derived by comparison with the respective equations of motion. It remains
also unclear in this approach what approximation (if any) is connected with the assumption that such two-time Dyson
equations for the investigated functions and the inverse of those functions, respectively, do exist. Also in this approach,
there occours the problem of the division by Pauli-blocking factors.

Looking at the complicate structure of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, there arises the question if a general formulation
in terms of a two-time Dyson equation is possible. The approach using the Shindo approximation is per se an
approximative one. Schuck et al. do not consider the Bethe-Salpeter equation at all but postulate just this two-time
structure. There are some strong arguments in favour of the possibility that exact equations exist for two-time Green’s
functions which contain solely two-time quantities (the inner structure of a self-energy operator could be complicate,
however). In a chemical picture, for instance, in which bound states are interpreted as a new species, one would
expect equations for correlation functions g≷
ab(t, t′) similar to the Kadanoﬀ-Baym equations in the single-particle case
with some two-particle self-energy functions. The spectral information, e.g. binding energies, damping etc., should
ab(t, t′) is for t = t′ just
follow from the retarded two-particle Green’s function gR
the two-particle density matrix.

ab(t, t′). The correlation function g<

In nonequilibrium one can derive an equation of the same structure like in Eq. (1), however, the time integrations
have to be performed then on the Keldysh contour. The functions involved in the integral term consist of many
correlation functions because they are dependent on three times at least. Sch¨afer et al. [23] considered the dynamically
screened ladder approximation for the polarizability in a semiconductor within the Keldysh formalism. They gave a
formulation for functions depending on three times or – after Fourier transformation – on two frequencies. At the
end, however, they used the Shindo approximation for these two-frequency quantities in order to get kinetic equations
for single-frequency functions.

There were attempts to generalize the Shindo approximation to functions in the time domain [24]. It was also
tried, [25], to generalize the approach of Schuck et al. within the nonequilibrium real-time Green’s functions method
postulating a Dyson equation for the retarded function gR
ab). In both approaches similar
results were achieved. The equilibrium results could be reproduced. Thus the same shortcomings arise for degenerate
systems.

ab(t, t′) = Θ(t − t′)(g>

ab − g<

We will present here a new approach [26] to this problem within the real-time Green’s functions method. Thus
we are able to describe nonequlibrium systems. Results for thermodynamic equlibium will appear as special case of
the more general equations. In this ﬁrst part the nonequilibrium Bethe-Salpeter equation is considered in a concrete
approximation, the so-called dynamically screened ladder equation. This is the simplest approximation in which the
eﬀective interaction is of dynamical nature. This will enable us to identify the underlying algebraic structures and to
keep the equations as simple as possible. The general scheme will be investigated in a subsequent paper [27].

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II the scheme of the real-time Green’s function method for single-

particle Green’s functions is summarized. The diﬃculties of the Bethe-Salpeter equation are discussed in Sec. III.

The dynamically screened ladder approximation is considered in Sec. IV. The Bethe-Salpeter equation is written

2

down in this approximation for two-time functions on the Keldysh double time contour. The ﬁrst terms of the
pertubation expansion with respect to the dynamically screened potential are evaluated. The two-time structure will
be achieved by applying the semi-group property of the ideal propagators. After that, the algebraic structures turn out
to be similar to those of the non-equilibrium Dyson-Keldysh equation in the single-particle case and the two-particle
self-energy functions can be identiﬁed by comparison. The thermodynamic equilibrium case is considered in Sec. V.
The structure of the two-particle self-energy which can be understood as an eﬀective Hamiltonian is discussed. The
results are compared with the former ones [12,15,10,20]. It will turn out that only in the nondegenerate case and in
the static limit, one is led to the same results.

II. SINGLE-PARTICLE QUANTITIES

Let us summarize shortly the scheme of real-time Green’s function technique in the single-particle case. The
equations are given on a double-time contour, on the so-called Keldysh contour [28,29]. Objects of the algebra are
matrices of causal and anticausal Green’s functions, ga and ga, and the correlation functions g≷

Eq. (7) is equivalent to a set of four equations which are, however, not all independent. Therefore, it is often more

III. BETHE-SALPETER EQUATION

The two-particle Green’s function is determined by the so-called Bethe-Salpeter equation

in which by introduction of the eﬀective interaction kernel Kab formally a closed equation is achieved for the four-point
function. Here, the kernel Kab is the sum of all diagrams irreducible with respect to a cutting of two single-particle
lines. The Bethe-Salpeter equation can be understood to hold in various contexts: for T = 0, for the imaginary-time
equilibrium Green’s functions in the Matsubara technique, or for the real-time Green’s functions on the Keldysh
contour.

The properties of a pair of particles should follow from this equation in the so-called particle-particle channel. If

one considers the causal two-particle Green’s function in this channel (t1 = t2 = t; t′

1 = t′

2 = t′), one has

On the right hand side of Eq. (18), however, there occurs a function depending on three times ¯t1, ¯t2, and t′ what is
enforced by the dynamical character of Kab. This Green’s function consists of six diﬀerent correlation functions

Only a static interaction in (18) would enforce ¯t1 = ¯t2, and the function would turn into the two-time causal one (19).
In principle, one could of course try to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation for a function depending on three times
(equivalent to a function depending on two frequencies) and then extract from this the information one is interested
in. This, however seems to be to complicated. In a number of papers it was tried therefore to work with equations
which involve exclusively two-time functions. This was achieved in two ways. The ﬁrst approach [12,13] uses within
the Matsubara technique the so-called Shindo approximation in which the two-frequency function is constructed from
the single-frequency causal Green’s function. This is possible in an exact way for a statical interaction and therefore
it was argued that for arbitrary Kab this would be correct in ﬁrst order with respect to the retardation. In the other
approach [21], a closed equation for the causal two-time or single-freqency, respectively, function is postulated. The
eﬀective hamiltonian (two-particle self-energy) is determined then by comparison with equations of motion.

in an approximate way.

In the next section we will show that closed equations exist for other combinations of correlation functions.

IV. DYNAMICALLY SCREENED LADDER APPROXIMATION

In analogy to the single-particle case, one is interested to get information on the statistical properties, carried by
the two-particle density matrix, as well as information on the two-particle dynamics, the spectral information. Below
we will see that it is not a trivial question to say which quantity carries this information.

In order to achieve the nested commutator structures, it was used that operators with equal times can be interchanged
according to (3). Interestingly enough these nested structures were found also by Rajagopal and Majumdar in their
analysis of double dispersion relations for the two-frequency causal Matsubara Green’s function (Appendix II of [11]).
We show in Appendix C as an example how the function GA
ab is connected in thermodynamic equilibrium with the
analytic continuation of the two-frequency Matsubara Green’s function.

and the commutation relations for the ﬁeld operators lead to [δ(r1 − r′

B. Transformation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation into a Dyson equation

In this subsection the dynamically screened ladder equation as a special approximation of the BSE is transformed
into a Dyson equation in which the occuring two-particle Green’s functions and two-particle self-energy functions are
dependent on two times only. For this purpose, the perturbation expansion of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (22) is
considered in the diagrammatic form shown in Fig. 2. It is analyzed ﬁrst for g<
ab; details are presented for diﬀerent
orders of V S

All functions in the above equations (33) and (34) are understood to depend on two times. The key idea in order

The diagrammatic structure of the two-particle self-energy functions is shown in Fig. 3. Primarily, these functions
consist of naked lines because we worked in ﬁrst order with respect to the dynamically screened potential. However,
all diagrams necessary to dress the lines could be found in higher orders of the expansion, see Appendix A 2 and
especially Fig. 5.

The self-energy functions ΣR/A

ab are functionals of single-particle Green’s functions. That is the reason why
it is suﬃcient to consider the two equations (33) and (34) in order to determine the correlation function g<
ab. In higher
approximations, the two-particle self-energy is expected to be a functional of two-particle correlation functions, too.
Then one would need also the equations for the other three quantities deﬁned in Eqs. (23-25). The full scheme of

The Eqs. (45–47) and (48–49), respectively, can be considered as the most important result of the present paper.
The latter equations are the two-particle counterpart to the Kadanoﬀ-Baym equations in the single-particle case.
Thus, these equations are the proper basis for the description of two-particle properties.

These expression for the two-particle self-energy have to be compared with the results of former papers [12,15].
The notations are slightly diﬀerent in comparison with ours, so one should compare the expressions of the eﬀective
hamiltonians. The total hamiltonian is H 0
ab + Vab being the hamiltonian of the isolated pair
of particles whereas the medium-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is denoted by H pl
ab(ω). In the present paper this
latter quantity is given by

ab + Vab + H pl

where ω is to be understood as an parameter.

The diﬀerences consist in the following: (i) now there a no additional static parts beyond the Hartree-Fock level,
(ii) no division by Pauli-blocking terms occurs. Both things seem to be produced artiﬁcially by adopting a closed
equation for the wrong quantity.

On the other hand, the same results as before are received in the nondegenerate case.

B. Limiting cases

It is interesting to study some limiting cases of our expressions. First, in the nondegenerate case the one-particle
distribution functions in Eqs. (66) and (68) can be neglected. The result is in aggreement with the nondegenerate
limit of the former approaches using the Shindo approximation [12,15,10,20].

The second important limiting case is that of statical screening. Following Zimmermann [20] we consider the case
2) − Ω, is small in comparison with the energy

that the excitation energy into a pair of two free particles, ǫa(p1) + ǫb(p′
ω1 occuring in the dielectric function. This could be a reasonable approximation for excited states. Then we have

C. Eﬀective wave equation and two-particle energies

The Eq. (60) which determines the two-particle propagator GR

ab was written down in an operator form. Using a
representation one gets a matrix equation. In order to solve this equation it is favorable to use a representation in
which diagonal elements are the main contribution. We follow here Kilimann et al. [15], however, now it is not possible
to achieve symmetric real and imaginary parts of the eﬀective hamiltonian simply by multiplying with factors N ±1/2
.
Therefore the hamiltonian is split into hermitean and antihermitean parts, see Appendix B. This leads to

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Starting from the nonequilibrium Bethe-Salpeter equation in the dynamically screened approximation, we have de-
rived a set of nonequilibrium Dyson equations for two-time two-particle correlation functions. The two-time structure
of these equations was achieved in an exact way using the semi-group properties of the ideal one-particle Green’s
functions. The prize one has to pay for this simpler structure of the equation is that the two-particle self-energy in the
Dyson equation consists now of irreducible diagrams in all orders with respect to the dynamically screened potential
(in some sence this is similar to the transition from Feynman diagrams to Goldstone diagrams [31]). Irreducibility
means here that a diagram cannot be cut with respect to a pair of single-particle lines which begin at equal times and
end at equal times, i.e., two ore more interaction potentials have some overlap in time.

For the further considerations we have restricted ourselves to a two-particle self-energy in ﬁrst order with respect to
the screened potential. The algebraic structure of the equations is not aﬀacted by this approximation. It was shown
that there is a set of equations for four two-time correlation functions. This generalizes the couple of Kadanoﬀ-Baym
equations for the one-particle correlation functions g≷ (g+− and g−+, respectively). In analogy to the single-particle
case there is no closed equation for the correlation functions but always a coupling to other correlation functions. Only
for two certain functions GR/A
there exist closed equations. Thus, these functions are the two-particle generalization
of the retarded (advanced) commutator Green’s functions gR/A
in the single-particle case and just these functions
describe the propagation of a pair of particles in the nonequilibrium many-particle system.

ab

a

The case of thermodynamic equilibrium was considered in some detail in order to show the diﬀerences to former
approaches. In former attempts [40,12] there were anticipated closed equations for the causal two-time two-particle
Green’s function. These equations were enforced by the Shindo approximation. The expressions for the eﬀective
hamiltonian are the same as those of the present paper only for the case of a nondegenerate system. The agreement in
this special case is easy to understand taking into account that the diﬀerence between the used functions is of higher
order in the density.

For arbitrary degeneracy there are clear diﬀerences between the former results and ours. In the present results
there is no division by Pauli-blocking terms. The only intrinsic static contributions of the eﬀective Hamiltonian (the
two-particle self-energy) are the Hartree-Fock single-particle self-energies and the Pauli-blocked basic potential.

We can conclude that the proper generalization of the Kadanoﬀ-Baym equations for two-particle functions is given
by the system of equations (48) and (49). The algebraic structure of these equations was identiﬁed starting from a
concrete approximation, the dynamically screened ladder equation. More general considerations how the self-energy
functions can be determined in higher approximations will be presented in a subsequent paper [27].

APPENDIX A: EVALUATION OF DYNAMICALLY SCREENED LADDER TERMS

The aim of this appendix is to show the evaluation of the lowest-order terms in the dynamically screened ladder
equation. Single-particle self-energy contributions and interaction terms have to be treated on equal footing. Special
attention is paid to the transformation into a structure involving two-particle quantities which depend on two times
only. The analysis is made here for the expansion of the function g<

for the other three functions g+−−+

1. First-order contributions

There are three diagrams of ﬁrst order with respect to the dynamically screened interaction V S

ab, see Fig. 2. Two
terms have single-particle self-energy insertions of particles a and b, respectively. The third one is a ladder diagram
with one rung.

The ﬁrst term with a self-energy insertion for particle a is given simply by [cf. Eq. 8]

2. Second–order contributions

According to Eqs. (36) and (37) the second-order terms should lead to diagrams with two self-energy insertions of
ﬁrst order with respect to V S (reducible diagrams) as well as to diagrams with one self-energy insertion which is of
second order. We will demonstrate this here for one typical term. The analysis of the ladder term with two rungs (cf.
Fig. 2) leads, among many other terms, to the following contribution (t1, t2, ¯t1, ¯t2 are integration variables)

The procedure to achieve a two-time structure is similar to that in the foregoing subsection. According to (15) each
causal function V S consists of 3 terms what leads to 9 terms in Eq. (A12). All contributions containing at least one
time-diagonal part are easily shown to be reducible. Therefore we concentrate on the others

where ΣR
in the foregoing subsection.

ab (2) denotes the two-particle self-energy in second order, and ΣR

ab (1) are the ﬁrst-order quantities identiﬁed

Analyzing the expressions in Eq. (A13), we ﬁnd that the “mixed” terms (with one V < and one V >) are reducible.
The terms containing two functions V > (or two functions V <) lead to a reducible term for t2 > ¯t1 (t1 > ¯t2) and to
an irreducible part for t2 < ¯t1 (t1 < ¯t2). This is shown in Fig. 4 in form of diagrams. The reducible terms contain
two-particle self-energy insertions of ﬁrst order with respect to V S. The second-order terms contributing to ΣR
are given by

This term can be shown to be a vertex correction to the two-particle vertex.

The other second-order diagrams in Fig. 2 can be discussed in a similar way. The terms with two single-particle
self-energy insertions for the same particle are reducible in any case. For the other two types of diagrams, there are
reducible as well as irreducible parts. This is shown in Fig. 5. The ﬁrst diagram in each row is a reducible one. The
second diagram is not reducible and it corresponds to a vertex correction term. The third diagram is not reducible
as well, but is the ﬁrst self-energy correction to the diagrams of the two-particle self-energy of ﬁrst order (cf. Fig. 3).
Because we started from a ladder equation we do not ﬁnd all possible second-order terms contributing to the two-
particle self-energy. Therefore we will restrict ourselves to the self-energy in ﬁrst order with respect to the dynamically
screened interaction.

APPENDIX C: CONNECTION OF GA

AB TO THE MATSUBARA GREEN’S FUNCTION

It is the purpose of this appendix to scetch for the case of thermodynamic equilibrium the connection to the
Matsubara technique for imaginary-time Green’s function. Especially, it will be shown that the Fourier transform of
the advanced two-particle Green’s function, which was deﬁned in Eq. 27, is closely related to the analytical continuation
of the two-frequency Matsubara Green’s function.

Imaginary time Green’s functions dependend on three times were considered by Rajagopal et al. [11,42] in connection
In this appendix the same notation is used. A

with an Bethe-Salpeter equation for an electron-positron system.
function in which the times of the creation operators are equal is given by

˜Gep(t1t2t3) =

hTW (ψ(t1)φ(t2)B(t3))i

B(t3) = φ†(t3)ψ†(t3) .

and

This function depending on three imaginary times is just the function for which the Bethe-Salpeter equation is
“closed”. The term “closed” means here that both sides of the equation contain the same type of functions.

For the Fourier coeﬃcient in Matsubara representation, Rajagopal and Cohen [42] found the following important

The Matsubara frequencies are ωa

ν = (2ν + 1)πi/β + µ(a).

Assume that the function ˜G(ep)(ωe

quantity the physical information on the two-particle problem. The usual way is to carry out the sum over one
frequency,

and performing afterwards the analytical continuation. The summation, however, leads to the Matsubara coeﬃcients
of the causal Green’s function depending on two imaginary times, cf. (19).

We want here to proceed on an other way. The analytical continuation is done for the two-frequency quantity. This
function G(ep)(z1, z2) is considered now for z1 = Ωe − iη and z2 = Ωp − iη with η → 0. Making the transformation
Ωe, Ωp −→ Ωep, Ωp we have

FIG. 2. Diagrammatic expansion of the dynamically screened ladder equation up to second order.

FIG. 3. Diagramatic structure of the two-particle self-energy in ﬁrst order in V S.

FIG. 4. Evaluation of the ladder terms with two rungs. The ﬁrst, the third, the fourth, and the ﬁfth term are reducible,
i.e., there are two successive self-energy insertions of ﬁrst order. The second and the last term, however, are not reducible: they
are two-particle self-energies of second order in V S.

FIG. 5. Here two other types of second-order terms are shown: in the ﬁrst row two single-particle self-energies are combined,
in the second row one single-particle self-energy is combined with one interaction between the particles. In dependence how
the times do overlap, there are three diﬀerent kinds of diagrams.

A kinetic theory for electromagnetic ion waves in a cold relativistic plasma is

derived. The kinetic equation for the broadband electromagnetic ion waves is coupled

to the slow density response via an acoustic equation driven by ponderomotive force

like term linear in the electromagnetic ﬁeld amplitude. The modulational instability

growth rate is derived for an arbitrary spectrum of waves. The monochromatic and

random phase cases are studied.

The interaction of intense radiation with plasmas is of fundamental importance in a wide

variety of applications, such as inertial conﬁnement fusion [1, 2] and pulsar emissions [3], and

such interactions can lead to a range of instabilities, e.g. Brillouin and Raman scattering as

well as modulational instabilities [4, 5, 6, 7]. In some of the instabilities, relativistic eﬀects

play an important role [7, 8, 9]. In Refs. [10, 11] it has been shown that a novel type of ion

electromagnetic wave may propagate through a cold magnetized relativistic plasma. Such

waves may be of relevance in high-energy astrophysical environments, e.g. pulsars, as well

as in intense laser interactions with high density targets. However, the coherence length

of intense electromagnetic (EM) waves could often be short. Moreover, it is well-known

that eﬀects of partial coherence may be used to stabilize the propagation of EM pulses in

nonlinear dispersive media [12, 13]. Thus, it is of interest to analyze the eﬀects of partial

coherence of EM ion wave propagation.

In this paper, the eﬀects of partial coherence ion EM waves in a magnetized relativistic

plasma is analyzed. In particular, a kinetic equation describing the evolution of the EM

quasi-particles is derived and the general nonlinear dispersion relation is obtained. We

study the eﬀects of partial coherence using a random phase background of EM ion waves,

leading to a Lorentz distribution for the quasi-particles. It is shown that the spatial spectral

broadening induced by the random phase gives rise to a reduction of the modulational

instability growth rate, in addition to the appearance of a new short wavelength instability

region.

Let us consider large amplitude circularly polarized electromagnetic ion waves, with the
electric ﬁeld amplitude E0, propagating parallel to a constant magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 = B0 ˆz in a

cold electron–ion plasma. Stenﬂo and Tsintsadze [11] have shown that there are situations in

which the ions are strongly relativistic. For such electromagnetic waves, the linear dispersion

relation is of the form

ω2 ±
where k is the wavenumber, ω is the wave frequency, ωpi = (e2n0i/ǫ0mi)1/2 is the ion plasma

frequency, ωEi = eE0/cmi, e is the magnitude of the electron charge, n0i is the unperturbed

ion density, ǫ0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, mi is the ion rest mass, and c is the speed of

light in vacuum. The + (−) in (1) correspond to |~pi|/mic > ωci/ω (|~pi|/mic < ωci/ω), where

~pi is the ion particle momentum and ωci = eB0/mi is the ion cyclotron frequency. If the

plus sign is used in the dispersion relation (1), we obtain the so called second ion-cyclotron

wave, whereas the minus sign gives the ion helicon wave.

The nonlinear evolution of electromagnetic ion waves, with amplitude E, in a cold quasi-

neutral relativistic plasma is given by [11]

With the ansatz E = (E0 + δE) exp(iφ), where δE ≪ E0 and φ ≪ 1, we linearize Eqs. (2)

For positive group velocity dispersion, we see that the second order dispersive term competes

with the nonlinear term, giving the characteristic modulational instability growth rate curve

(cf. Figs. 1 and 2).

We are now interested in analyzing the eﬀects of partial coherence of the electromagnetic

ion waves. For this purpose, we introduce the Wigner function [15, 16, 17, 18]

We note that the Wigner method [19], as well as the equivalent mutual coherence

method [20], have been used to analyze the modulational instability of the cubic nonlinear

Schr¨odinger equation relevant for e.g. nonlinear optics. Moreover, in plasma applications

the Zakharov equations have been analyzed using the above method [21] in order to obtain

the statistical dynamics and Landau like damping of Langmuir waves.

Applying the time derivative to the deﬁnition (7) and using (2), we obtain the kinetic

evolution of broad band electromagnetic ion waves in cold relativistic plasmas.

In order to analyze the modulational instability of the system (3), (8), and (9), we let

ρ(t, z, p) = ρ0(p) + δρ exp(iKz − iΩt) and δn ∝ exp(iKz − iΩt), where δρ ≪ ρ0. Linearizing

Eqs. (3), (8), and (9), we then obtain the nonlinear dispersion relation

In the case of a monochromatic spectral distribution, ρ0(p) = E2

dispersion relation (5), as expected. However, if the background distribution ρ0 has a ﬁnite

spectral width, the dispersion relation is altered. Next, we look at the case of a random

phased background electromagnetic ion wave. This will give rise to the spectral distribution

Next, we analyze the modulational instability properties of the dispersion relation (12).
We introduce the dimensionless variables ¯Ω = Ω/ω, ¯K = vgK/ω, ¯∆ = vg∆/ω, ¯v = vs/vg,
¯v′ = ωv′
g. In Figs. 1 (+ in Eq. (2)) and 2 (− in Eq. (2)) we have displayed
the growth rate Γ = Im( ¯Ω) for some typical parameter values. Using ¯v = 0.33, ¯β = 1, and
¯v′ = 0.5, it can be seen that a ﬁnite spectral width ¯∆ gives rise to a reduced growth rate.
On the other hand, the ¯K-region, where the instability occurs, is enlarged. We also note

that the +-mode has a larger growth rate as compared to the −-mode in Eq. (9).

To summarize, we have analyzed the eﬀects of a partial coherence of circularly polarized

electromagnetic ion waves in relativistic plasmas. In particular, the modulational instability

growth rate was found for both coherent waves and for waves with a random phase. It was

shown that the eﬀect of partial coherence is to stabilize the propagation of the aforemen-

tioned waves, while broadening the possible instability wavenumber region. The latter could

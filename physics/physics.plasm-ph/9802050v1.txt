Abstract

The formation of binary correlations in plasma is studied from the quantum kinetic
equation. It is shown that this formation is much faster than dissipation due to col-
lisions. In a hot (dense) plasma the correlations are formed on the scale of inverse
plasma frequency (Fermi energy). We derive analytical formulae for the time depen-
dency of the potential energy which measures the extent of correlations. We discuss
the dynamical formation of screening and compare with the statical screened result.
Comparisons are made with molecular dynamic simulations.

Recent lasers allow to create a high density plasma within few femto seconds
and observe its time evolution on a comparable scale [1,2]. In this paper we
discuss the very ﬁrst time regime, the transient regime, in terms of the energy
balance. Let us assume a typically set up of molecular dynamics. One takes N
particles, distributes them randomly into a box and let them classically move
under Coulomb forces due to their own charges. Their ﬁrst movement thus
forms correlations which lower the Coulomb energy VC = e2/r. This build up
of screening stops when the eﬀective Debye potential VD = e2e−
κr/r is reached.
We will discuss the formation of correlations in terms of correlation energy.
To this end we can use a kinetic equation, which leads to the total energy
conservation. It is immediately obvious that the ordinary Boltzmann equation
cannot be used because the kinetic energy is an invariant of its collision inte-
gral. We have to consider non-Markovian kinetic equations of Levinson type

q, ¯t)
etc., is balanced by the lifetime τ . The total energy conservation for Levin-
son’s equation has been proved in [3]. The solution in the short-time region
t
τ can be written down analytically. In this time domain we can ne-
glect the time evolution of distributions, ¯fa(¯t) = fa(0), and the life-time fac-
= 1. The resulting expression for (1) describes then how
tor, exp
two particles correlate their motion to avoid the strong interaction regions.
This very fast formation of the oﬀ-shell contribution to Wigner’s distribu-
tion has been found in numerical treatments of Green’s functions [4,5]. Of
course, starting with a sudden switching approximation we have Coulomb in-
teraction and during the ﬁrst transient time period the screening is formed.
This can be described by the non-Markovian Lenard - Balescu equation [6]
instead of the static screened equation (1) leading to the dynamical expres-
sion of the correlation energy [details, see [7]]. To demonstrate its results
and limitations, we use Maxwell initial distributions at the high temperature
limit, where the distributions are non-degenerated. From (1) we ﬁnd with

In Figs. 1, this formulae are compared with molecular dynamic simulations
[8] for two values of the plasma parameter Γ = 0.1 and 1. This parameter
Γ = e2
4πn)1/3 is the inter-particle distance or Wigner-Seitz
radius, measures the strength of the Coulomb coupling. Ideal plasma are found
for Γ
1. In this region the static formula (3) well follows the major trend of
the numerical result, see Fig. 1. The agreement is in fact surprising, because
the static result underestimates the dynamical long time result of Debye-
H¨uckel √3/2Γ3/2 by a factor of two, which can be seen from the long time and

The ﬁrst result represents the Montroll correlation energy [9,10]. The expla-
nation for this fact is that we can prepare the initial conﬁguration within our
kinetic theory such that sudden switching of interaction is fulﬁlled. However,
in the simulation experiment we have initial correlations which are due to the
set up within quasiperiodic boundary condition and Ewald summations. This
obviously results into an eﬀective statically screened Debye potential, or at
least the simulation results allow for this interpretation.

For Γ = 1, see Fig. 1, non-ideal eﬀects become important and the formation
time is underestimated within (3). This is due to non-ideality which was found
to be an expression of memory eﬀects [11] and leads to a later relaxation.

The characteristic time of formation of correlations at high temperature limit
is given by the inverse plasma frequency τc ≈
vthκ . The inverse plasma
frequency indicates that the long range ﬂuctuations play the dominant role.
This is equivalent to the time a particle needs to travel through the range of
the potential with a thermal velocity vth. This conﬁrms the numerical ﬁnding
of [12] that the correlation or memory time is proportional to the range of
interaction. In the low temperature region, i.e., in a highly degenerated system
µ
T , one ﬁnds a diﬀerent picture [13,14]. Unlike in the classical case, the
equilibrium limit of the degenerated case is rapidly built up and then oscillates

around the equilibrium value. We can deﬁne the build up time τc as the time
where the correlation energy reaches its ﬁrst maximum, τc = 1.0 ¯h
µ with the
Fermi energy µ. Note that τc is in agreement with the quasiparticle formation
time known as Landau’s criterion. Indeed, the quasiparticle formation and the
build up of correlations are two alternative views of the same phenomenon.
The formation of binary correlations is very fast on the time scale of dissipative
processes. Under extremely fast external perturbations, like the massive femto
second laser pulses, the dynamics of binary correlations will hopefully become
experimentally accessible.

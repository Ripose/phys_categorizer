A computational ﬂuid model is developed to study waves and instabilities. A new technique

involving initial perturbations in conﬁguration space have been implemented to excite the plasma

waves; i.e. the perturbations acting similar to a random velocity distribution in particle in cell (PIC)

codes. This forms a new powerful tool for investigation of many waves arising in both thermal and

cold plasmas and as such will allow investigation of problems demanding scales and resolution not yet

possible by PIC codes. The model predicts Langmuir waves, two stream instabilities, nonlinear wave-

wave interaction, and the Debye screening eﬀects. The agreement between theory and simulation

where analytic results are available are excellent.

I. INTRODUCTION

Due to the fundamental importance of the waves and instabilities in plasma and hydrodynamics investigations,

computational researchers have devoted great eﬀorts in developing appropriate tools. One of the main challenges after

developing numerically stable algorithms in ﬂuid models has been generation of the waves in the linear, nonlinear as

well as unstable modes; i.e. waves which preserve analytic dispersion relations1 [2]. Furthermore extending the case

of hydrodynamics to that of MHD and or plasma physics one deals with waves with considerably more complicated

propagation characteristics than the hydrodynamics cases treated by those authors; i.e. dispersion, polarization,

oblique propagations, etc.

The main problems in generating a wave spectrum from small amplitude disturbances in ﬂuid equations are: (1) the

highly nonlinear nature of those equations; (2) the lack of an initial thermal velocity distribution. The ﬁrst problem

could cause any small amplitude conﬁguration space disturbance to grow to very large amplitudes in relatively short

times and result in wave breaking and non-propagation. Also when there does exist a thermal distribution, there

are always a distribution of thermalized particles in phase with most waves; they can therefore excite the allowed

modes to at least half their thermal level. Therefore in a case without thermal equilibrium, a disturbance of arbitrary

wavelength cannot strictly speaking apportion its energy to other allowed modes. For example in purely electrostatic

cases, we know from equilibrium statistical mechanics that when there exist a thermal distribution each mode El(k)

can acquire an energy [3]:

To investigate MHD wave spectra therefore magnetohydrodynamic particle codes have served as powerful tools [4],

[6], [7], and [8]. For other plasma waves PIC [9] and [10] or hybrid codes [8], [11], and [12] have served as the main

wave investigation tools; i.e., basically codes which start from thermal equilibrium. In these codes the random particle

distribution acts like a disturbance in velocity space and conﬁguration space remains unaltered at the beginning of

each simulation.

In our case we initiate each simulation by a perturbation in conﬁguration space. Despite the initial shape of the

perturbation, we observe other allowed modes to develop similar to PIC simulations. We believe that the mesh dis-

cretization and the ﬁnite diﬀerencing contribute in the following ways: (i) round of errors alter the initial perturbation

shape and can drive other wavelength; (ii) as the nonlinear eﬀects grow amplitudes and shorten wavelengths to the

numerical dissipation and dispersion scale lengths, these eﬀects can act to dampen and initiate the propagation of

the diﬀerent modes and prevent indeﬁnite nonlinear growth. These eﬀects can therefore explain the observed wave

spectra. With this then we can use ﬂuid instead of PIC codes as a convenient alternative to investigate many waves.

The organization of the paper is as follows: in section II the model is treated analytically; in section III the numerical

scheme (algorithm, stability and conservation laws) are presented; in section IV the various tests of the model are

presented (test of the dispersion relation, two stream instability, screening eﬀect and nonlinear harmonic generation).

At the end a brief summary and conclusion with future direction are presented.

We focus on the investigation of the high frequency (hf) longitudinal waves; i. e. a frequency domain where ions can

be safely assumed to form an immobile background (n0 represents their uniform density). The appropriate equations

are then Poisson’s and the electron ﬂuid equations:

Here ϕ is the self-consistent electric potential, and n, v, P and m represent the electron density, velocity, pressure

equations are supplemented by an ”equation of state” according to the particular thermodynamic properties of the

ﬂuid of interest. Here, isothermal equation of state is used:

where T is the electron temperature and is assumed to be constant and Boltzmann’s constant, k, is assumed to be

Studies of Langmuir waves (hf electron waves) are of particular importance. Aside from the applications to real

experimental situations which will become evident in the application section, they serve as excellent probes for testing

the validity of the ﬂuid code that we have developed.

III. NUMERICAL ALGORITHM

Our model is simply an intuitive construct based on well-known ﬂuid dynamics and Poisson’s equations, geared

toward plasma physics applications, where many diﬀerent wave phenomena in dispersive media are of interest. Its

physical ”conceptual basis” can be regarded as a model that treats non-stationary electron wave motion for hf domain

B. The Numerical Scheme

It is already mentioned, logarithmic term in Eq. (21) is caused by the electron pressure.. Thus the code has the

ﬂexibility of being easily converted to the case when electron pressure is negligible.

Next we shall describe the numerical scheme. The steps of the scheme are summarized in Table I. A Lax-Wendroﬀ

method is used to push n and v, while a poisson solver at the end of each step updates the electric potential.

The grid spacing and time step are denoted by ∆ and ∆t respectively. The ﬂuid velocity and density are known

at integer time step l. To complete the initial conditions, ϕ is computed at the same time step (l) by the help of a

Poisson solver that is based on tridiagonal matrix method. Then n and v are pushed from l to l + 1/2 as the auxiliary

step of the Lax-Wendroﬀ scheme using Eqs. (20) and (21) (please refer to item 3 of the Table I). Then again ϕ is

computed in the auxiliary step (l + 1/2) using the value of n in the mentioned step. Having known n, v, and ϕ at the

time step l + 1/2, we push n and v all the way to time step l + 1 as the main step of the Lax-Wendroﬀ scheme in Eqs.

(20) and (21) (items 5 and 6 in Table I). The electric potential ϕ is then computed at the time step l + 1 using nl+1.

C. Conservation Laws

Equations (19), (20) are in conservative form, and we demand that the corresponding diﬀerence equations to be

equally conservative. More speciﬁcally, we expect ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme to conserve the mass density (

+∞
−∞ ndx),

momentum and the energy of the system, irrespective of the errors incurred by the ﬁnite diﬀerence lattice.

To investigate the conservation laws, in what follows, a method compatible with both the auxiliary and the main

steps will be presented [14]. That is, Eqs. (20) and (21) are integrated over each space-time cell (m) of area ∆t∆m
(∆t = tl+1

Summing over cells (m) in the system results in:

Since ﬁnite diﬀerences were used in computing all the derivatives, then if one sums over all the grid cells in the system,

each such quantities will appear twice with opposite signs corresponding to the cell boundaries that are being shared

between the neighboring cells, and they will thus add up to zero. There can, however, be contributions from the

walls of the computation box. For the periodic boundary condition the walls contributions gives zero; for other cases

appropriate boundary conditions are implemented to insure good conservation using guard cells.

D. Numerical Stability Analysis

In order to obtain the Courant-Fredricks-Lewy (CFL) condition for the model, the diﬀerence equations (obtained

from the diﬀerential equations for the problem by discretizing them) must be considered. We follow the method
of Potter [14]; i.e. obtain the integration time pusher operator from the diﬀerence equations assuming a spatially

uniform system and solve them in Fourier space and obtain a non-local result. We shall do the stability analysis with

Next using Eqs. (33), (34), and (35), after combining the auxiliary and the main steps of the Lax-Wendroﬀ scheme

and assuming n, v, and ϕ to have the form (l refers to the time step and m inside the parenthesis to the grid location

and large amplitude (nonlinear) eﬀects in an initially uniform plasma. In what follows, a review of the results will be

given.

IV. TESTING THE CODE

A. Dispersion relation

The most basic requirement of a computational model aside from conservation laws is its ability to predict the

linear theory; e.g. the waves dispersion relation. The degree to which the analytic dispersion relation is obeyed acts

as a gauge of the computational model and serves to determine its limitations.

From Eq. 40, the dispersion relation of the corresponding diﬀerence equation is:

−ωI ∆t sin(ωR∆t) =

e

(∆t)2 cos2 σ(1 +

∆2 sin2 σ).

where ω = ωR + ωI . Comparison of this with the analytic dispersion relation shows that by changing k
k sin(k∆)/(k∆) in the analytic case one roughly recovers the above result for ∆t ωR ≪
that ωI does not have any k dependence, implies no part of the k space to be more susceptible to numerical instability
than others3. The diﬀerence dispersion relation above also indicates that for sin(k∆)/(k∆)

dispersion to disappear; i.e. for modes with wavelengths long compared with the grid spacing it should be negligible.

For the initial perturbations, small ﬂuctuations in the density from a uniform background were implemented. Table

2. shows three diﬀerent initial perturbations used in the simulations; i.e. :

n(x) = 1 + 0.01 sin(k0x)

n(x) = 1 + 0.01(

The reason for these choices is that the ﬁrst perturbation maintain harmonics with wave numbers very close to k0

while the latter two maintain harmonics more uniformly distributed in the k space. The most important reason for

such choices was to determine the impact of the initial perturbations on the ﬁnal wave spectra; strictly speaking the

latter two are expected to give rise to more uniform spectra. The initial velocity proﬁles corresponding to these three

proﬁles are drawn in Figs. 1(a), (b) and (c). These velocity proﬁles indicate broader and more uniform distribution of

bulk ﬂow velocities in the latter two; i.e. the volume of phase space available to wave propagations are considerably

larger.

3Many PIC algorithms show ωI ∝ k2; i.e. intense short wavelength noise or instability.

Given these two facts though, the plots of the power spectra4 of the modes versus ω (their frequency) indicate very

close agreement in all the cases; i.e. regardless of the initially excited modes and phase velocities, most the allowed

k-space tends to get excited. This supports our earlier claim that the discretization procedure and the numerical

dispersion and dissipation have in eﬀect broadened and stabilized the initial spectrum.

Finally the plots of the dispersion relation for a system size of 1024∆ with ∆ = 0.01 are shown in Fig 2 and 3. The

close agreement between the analytic theory (solid lines) and the model (circles) for wave numbers k as large as 6

indicate resolution of the modes with wave lengths of the order of grid spacing with negligible numerical dispersion.

Comparison of these with the corresponding PIC simulations for a system 256∆ length (Fig. 4) clearly indicate

resolution of much shorter wavelengths here and considerably less numerical dispersion. This is understandable since

in the PIC models the ﬁnite particle size eﬀects introduce additional numerical dispersion which cause smaller allowed

k’s.

4The power spectrum is determined in two steps: First, the spatial FFT is used in a quantity (e.g. E(x,t)) and stored E(ki,t),

next for each ki temporal FFT is performed on E(ki,t)

One last remark about the cases corresponding to Figs. 2 and 3 is that the latter involves the case in which the bulk

plasma had an initial ﬂow velocity. Fig. 3 not only shows that the doppler shifted waves also obey their respected

dispersion relation, it also shows how any ”resulting” plasma ﬂow could impact those waves. That is if any nonzero

average ﬂow should arise from the initial perturbations (i.e. if the scheme does not preserve momentum conservation

) the dispersion relation would be impacted as in Fig. 3. A glance at Fig. 2 though points that there could not

have been any doppler shift and therefore no net plasma ﬂow must have resulted from the initial perturbations.

Calculations also showed that

B. Wave Launching on the Boundary

In the next example a wave is launched from the boundary and its behavior is followed. Theoretically, recall that

in an unmagnetized plasma and in the linear regime the plasma shields any incoming AC density perturbation whose

frequency is less than plasma frequency (ωp). This eﬀect is shown in Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 6. In this example the

frequency of the applied density perturbation is half of the plasma frequency. The wave is launched at x =

The amplitude of the density perturbation has the following range: nonlinear (0.2,1.8) Fig. 5(a) and linear (0.99,1.01)

Fig. 5(b)5. The penetration depth is from x = (

In the other case, with the same initial condition (respect to linear case), we launched a wave whose frequency

was larger than the plasma frequency( ω > ωp). This time the density perturbation propagated into the plasma with

its wavelength and amplitude unchanged as it penetrated the plasma. Its behavior also conformed with the analytic

dispersion relation. The results are shown in Fig. 7.

C. Two Stream Instability

As a more severe test of the code, we treated the two stream instability. Although the instability arises under

a wide range of beam conditions, we shall consider only the simple case of two countrastreaming uniform beams of

electrons with the same number density n0. The ﬁrst beam travels in the x direction with drift velocity vd and the

second beam in the opposite direction with same drift velocity, i.e. the countrastreaming beams have the same speed.

The dispersion relation is as follows:

where ω2

p = 4πe2n0/m is the same plasma frequency for both beams. One can then obtain the following expression

for ω2:

This relationship between ω2 and k2 is shown graphically in Fig. 8. It is clear that, there exists a critical wave number
kc which separates the stable and unstable modes. In fact , for k2 < k2

c two values of ω are complex, one of which

These eﬀects are examined by the ﬂuid code. In this case the code was generalized to a two countrastreaming ﬂuid

model. As the two countrastreaming beams emerging from the opposite ends meet half way into the simulation box,

a growing wavelike disturbance develops. Figs. 9 and 10 show the evolution of this disturbance for the cases with and

without the pressure terms respectively. In both cases the disturbance grows locally while in the latter it also begins

to propagate in both directions; i.e. a result of the dispersion due to the pressure term.

V. CONCLUSION

The result of this paper demonstrates that ﬂuid model can be used to investigate any waves predicted by their

basic set of equation. This can include waves of kinetic nature with and without dispersion with resolution far greater

than the corresponding PIC codes. It was demonstrated that appropriate initial perturbations coupled with diﬀerence

algorithms of suﬃcient but not excessive numerical dispersion and dissipation can give rise to wave spectra spanning

all the allowed k-space. Many areas of plasma and or space research can greatly beneﬁt from these techniques.

Catalyzing Fusion with Relativistic Electrons

Hanno Ess´en
Mechanics, KTH

January 1997

Abstract

The idea here is to use large relative velocities of electrons and
nuclei in accelerator beams to increase the probability of fusion. The
function of the electrons is to both screen the positive charge and to
produce an increased parallel pinching current. The increase in reac-
tion probability is estimated using the Darwin magnetic interaction
energy approach.

In order to get fusion of, say, deuterons, one normally requires very high
temperatures. The reason for this is twofold: ﬁrstly a large kinetic energy
is needed for the particles to penetrate the Coulomb barriers, and secondly
high speeds are needed to get appreciable reaction rates in spite of very small
cross sections. The well known problem with this is that the high temperature
makes high density and conﬁnement diﬃcult to achieve. Another problem
is that as the speeds go up the cross sections go down. The purpose here is
to present a radically diﬀerent idea of achieving fusion, an idea that starts
from the observation that at relativistic speeds the Coulomb repulsion can
be balanced by a magnetic attraction.

The following well known calculation illustrates the basic facts. Consider
a beam of charged particles moving along a straight line with speed v and
constant charge density ρ0 within some ﬁxed radius of the line and zero
outside. From ∇ · E = 4πρ0 we then get

for the radial and only component of the electric ﬁeld. From ∇×B = 4πρ0v/c
we similarly get

We see that the Coulomb self repulsion of the beam goes to zero as v → c.

The above result in itself is, of course, not useful for fusion purposes.
Firstly, the cost of accelerating two deuterons to relativistic speeds is far
greater that the energy from a fusion reaction between them. Secondly, by
transforming back to the rest frame of the particles in the beam, we see that
they are not likely to fuse more often just because they have high speed
relative to an irrelevant observer. Both these problems are solved, and this
is the crucial idea here, if a beam of relativistic electrons is injected into a
moderate energy beam of deuterons. To maximize the relative (and thus
‘real’) speed the electrons should be injected with a velocity opposite to that
of the deuterons.

Let us go back to the calculation above for this situation. If we manage
to make the particle densities equal, ρD = |ρe|, we get ρ0 = ρD + ρe = 0 and
thus zero electric ﬁeld: Er = 0. For the magnetic ﬁeld, on the other hand,
we get

Bϕ = 2πρD

since the two currents contributing are assumed to be in the same direction.
The Lorentz force on a deuteron is now

The Lorentz force is now seen to strive to contract the beam. Since we
assume that vD ≪ |ve| the force on the electrons is much greater than on the
deuterons. As soon as the electrons have contracted to smaller radius than
the deuterons, however, there will be a Coulomb force, from them, acting to
contract the deuteron beam.

Due to the attraction of parallel currents, alias the ‘pinch’ eﬀect, the beam
of electrons with velocity opposite to that of the positive ions, leads to an
automatic conﬁning action on the combined beam. So far we have looked at

2

the beam as smeared out charge densities. We must now consider the forces
between the individual particles in the beam.

There is no known relativistic expression that can be used so we will
consider the Darwin Hamiltonian which is known to be correct to order
(v/c)2. According to the Darwin Hamiltonian the interaction energy of two
charged particles, i and j, is

Vij =

qiqj
rij

−

qiqj[pi · pj + (pi · eij)(pj · eij)]
2c2mimjrij

.

Here eij is the unit vector from particle i to j. It is assumed that one can
replace pi/m by vi. This gives:

Vij =

qiqj
rij  

1 −

vi · vj + (vi · eij)(vj · eij)
2c2

.

!

We again see that the Coulomb interaction is reduced if the particles are
moving in the same direction, just as in our ﬁrst study of the charged beam.
Now, however, if we consider the deuterons in the rest frame of the electrons,
which should be relevant since the deuterons are moving among the electrons,
we ﬁnd a real eﬀect. For two deuterons moving, along the same line, with
speed v relative to the electrons, we get

Vij =

This indicates that for suﬃciently rapid electrons we get rid of the Coulomb
repulsion.

It is clearly not correct to use the Darwin interaction energy, which is a
relativistic correction to the classical interaction, when the speeds become
highly relativistic. There is reason, however, to believe that the indicated
qualitative eﬀect, a reduction of the Coulomb repulsion, is a real one and
persists also in the fully relativistic case. It is also interesting to note the
similarity of equation (9) with equation (3), in which no assumption about
small speed was made.

Let us now take equation (9) seriously. We are thus considering the
deuterons as moving at relativistic speeds relative to the frame deﬁned by
the electrons of the beam. Let us consider two of these deuterons. Even
if they both have relativistic speeds, their relative speed is not particularly
great. It is their relative speed that determines the eﬀect of their interaction.
They will thus repel each other with a reduced Coulomb force according
to formula (9). They also attract each other via the strong force and this

Here A and λ are constants. In what follows we will use atomic units (¯h =

We will thus assume that the deuterons interact via the potential energy

The question now is what values of v are reasonable to use. The energy
gain from fusion reactions between deuterons are tabulated in table 1. The
combined energy of the deuterons and the electrons may not exceed what
can be gained from the fusion reactions if we are to make an energy proﬁt.
We see that the available energy is strongly dependent on which of the
three ﬁrst reactions of table 1 that occurs.
In ordinary collision reactions
between deuterons the two ﬁrst reactions dominate completely. The reason
is that the high relative speed of the deuterons does not give time for an elec-
tromagnetic process to occur. The two ﬁrst reactions involve the strong force
and this force has much smaller time scales. In this application, however,
we do not need high relative velocity since we instead lower the Coulomb
barrier. There is then strong reason to expect that the third reaction will be
much more common. Even if the ﬁrst are more common there is then hope
that secondary (the fourth and ﬁfth of table 1) reactions will occur with the
released protons and tritium ions. In any case one should not have to put
in more than, say, 20 Mev, of energy into the electrons. Note carefully that

the electrons are not consumed by the process; they can be circulated and
reused unless they are scattered or otherwise lost from the beam.

We now estimate the probability that the deuterons will tunnel through
the Coulomb barrier of the potential (11). The probability will depend on
θ(v) = 1 − v2/c2 and on the relative kinetic energy E of the deuterons. A
semiclassical estimate of the tunnelling probability is given by

Six diﬀerent values of P for θ = 1, 0.01, 0.0006, and for E = 0.1, 0.01 (atomic
units) for each θ, are given in table 2. It is clear from the table that the tun-
nelling probability goes from essentially zero to physically interesting values
when θ takes values corresponding to relativistic electrons.

Are these tunnelling probabilities realistic and relevant? If they are it
should be easy to achieve fusion with the method outlined here. Relevant
questions are: what density of Deuterium ions and electrons are technically
possible in the initial beams? How much does this density increase due to the
self contraction when the beams meet? How large a fraction of the Deuterium
ions that have not fused can be recirculated? How large a fraction of the
relativistic electrons can be recirculated? The answer to these questions will
determine the feasibility, economy, and future usefulness of the method for
controlled fusion proposed above.

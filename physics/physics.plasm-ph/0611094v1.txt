Abstract

Radiation spectrum of extreme relativistic electrons and a probability of electron-positron pair

production by energetic photons in a strong plasma wakeﬁeld are derived in the framework of

a semiclassical approach.

It is shown that that the radiation losses of the relativistic electron

in the plasma wakeﬁeld scale as

ε2/3 in the quantum limit when the energy of the radiated

∝

photon becomes close to the electron energy, ε. The quantum eﬀects will play a key role in future

plasma-based accelerators operating at ultrahigh energy of the electrons.

Crystalline ﬁelds along with laser ﬁelds are now the most important tools in laboratory
strong-ﬁeld physics. The electric ﬁeld of atomic strings in a crystal can be up to 1011 V/cm

near a crystallographic axis or plane [1]. When the ultrarelativistic electron with energy

about hundred GeV moves along the crystallographic axis the electric ﬁeld can reach the
critical electric ﬁeld Ecr = m2c3/(e~)
1016V / cm in the rest frame of the electron, where
e and m is the charge and mass of the electron, respectively, c is the velocity of light, ~ is

≈

Planck’s constant. At this ﬁeld strength quantum eﬀects becomes signiﬁcant. A number

of interesting strong-ﬁeld phenomena, such as a quantum recoil, pair production, spin ﬂip

have been observed in the experiments with crystals (see, e. g., [1] and references therein).

Impressive progress in the laser technology during last decades promises to generate even

stronger electromagnetic ﬁelds than the ﬁelds that are achievable in a crystal [2]. Nonlinear

Compton eﬀect and pair production by nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process have been recently

investigated experimentally in collisions of 49 GeV electron beam with terawatt laser pulses

[3]. Quantum eﬀects in a strong laser ﬁeld are now intensively discussed [4, 5].

Another example of a strong electromagnetic ﬁeld, that is achievable under laboratory

conditions, is a strong plasma ﬁeld. The strong plasma ﬁelds can be generated by short

intense laser pulse or by short and dense electron bunch propagating in a plasma. The

plasma electrons can be completely expelled from interaction region leaving behind a plasma

cavity (”bubble“) with uniform ion density [6]. The huge space charge formed due to the

electron evacuation generates strong electromagnetic ﬁeld. The strong plasma wakeﬁeld

is now considered as a key element of plasma-based accelerators [7], laser-plasma x-ray

radiation sources [8], positron sources based on collisions of plasma-produced hard photons

with high-Z materials [9].

The relativistic electron loaded in the plasma cavity experiences accelerating and focusing

mω2
forces. The focusing force F⊥ ≈
moving in the direction of driver (laser pulse or electron bunch) with pz ≫
p⊥ are the longitudinal and transverse components of the electron momentum, respectively,
ωp = (4πe2n0/m)1/2 is the electron plasma frequency, n0 is the background plasma density, r

pr/2 is very strong for the ultrarelativistic electron

p⊥, where pz and

is the distance from the electron to the cavity axis. It is assumed that the axially symmetrical

cavity and the driver move along z-axis. The action of the focusing force leads to the

transverse betatron oscillations of the electron about z-axis. The betatron frequency is
ωb = ωp(2γ)−1/2, where γ = ε/(mc2) is the Lorentz factor related to the energy of the

2

electron, ε. The relativistic electrons undergoing betatron oscillations emit electromagnetic

radiation [10]. The spectrum of the radiation becomes synchrotronlike with the critical
frequency ~ωc = 3~ω2
pr0γ2/ (2c) when the amplitude of betatron oscillations, r0, is large
1 [11].

The photon energy increases with increasing the electron energy. When they become

close to each other classical description of radiation emission is no longer valid. Quantum

eﬀects in strong electromagnetic ﬁelds can be characterized by the dimensionless invariants
(~ω/mc2)(F⊥/eEcr), where Fµν is the
[12] χ = e~/(m3c5)

mines the photon interaction with electromagnetic ﬁeld. Quantum-electrodynamic eﬀects
are important when χ & 1 or Υ & 1. If χ & 1 then ~ω

ε and a quantum recoil imposed

on the electron by the emitted photon is strong. The invariants can be presented in the

which are close to the parameters considered in Ref. [8]. The invariants is close to unity
for the particles with energy 500 GeV. For n0 = 1020 cm−3 the threshold energy, above

∼

≈

which quantum eﬀects are decisive, becomes 50 GeV. While the radiation generation in a

plasma wakeﬁeld has been much studied in the classical limit (χ

1), a little theory for

≪

the quantum regime (χ & 1) of radiation emission by a relativistic electrons as well as for

pair production by decay of an energetic photon in a plasma wakeﬁeld currently exists. In

this Letter we study these quantum processes.

The motion of the relativistic electron in the plasma wakeﬁeld is semiclassical because the
energy level distance of the electron in the plasma wakeﬁeld is about ~ωb, that is much less

than ε. Yet the radiation emission can be quantum because the energy of the emitted photon

can be close to ε. In order to describe the radiation emission in the plasma wakeﬁeld it is

convenient to use the semiclassical operator method [13]. This method strongly simpliﬁes

the calculation of the radiation spectrum since the spectrum can be expressed through the

parameters of the classical trajectory of the electron. The operator method was applied to

calculation of the radiation spectrum in the magnetic ﬁeld, Coulomb ﬁeld, crystalline ﬁeld

[12, 13]. In the framework of the semiclassical approach the energy radiated by an electron

emission. The structure of the plasma ﬁeld is taken into account through the classical

Like in the classical limit [14] the main contribution to the integral in Eq. (3) comes from
k. The radiation of the relativistic

The velocity vector of the electron undergoing betatron motion is conﬁned within the

The radiation emission is synchrotronlike if θd ≫

In the opposite limit the radia-

synchrotron radiation regime since the contribution to the radiation spectrum from the tra-

jectory part, where r < rd, is negligibly small. The reason is that the energy radiated by

an electron decreases as r decreases and the transverse radius of the plasma cavity, Rpc, is
much more than rd because Rpc ∼

Lpc > c/ωp [15].

The used approach is valid if the focusing ﬁeld does not signiﬁcantly change when the

electron passes formation length along its trajectory [13]. Since the focusing force depends

r. This coincides with the condition when dipole radiation is negligible, r

only on r [16] the validity condition related to the ﬁeld uniformity can be written as follows
lf θd ≪
Another validity condition is that the formation length should be much less than the length

An electron-positron pair can be created by an energetic photon in strong electromagnetic

ﬁelds [12]. Therefore, photon emission by relativistic electrons can cause inverse process of

pair production by a hard photon in a strong plasma ﬁeld. The pair production is related to

photon emission by crossing channel. The probability of pair production can be calculated

7

by the semiclassical method used above [13]. The probability per unit time is

of pair production and photon emission. The validity conditions of Eq. (6) are identical to

that discussed above for Eq. (1).

The energy distribution of positrons (electrons) created by a photon with energy 300 GeV

in the plasma bubble is shown in Fig. 2 for diﬀerent values of r, where r is the distance

between the photon and z-axis. The photon propagates in the direction of z-axis. The
plasma bubble parameters are Lpc ≈
10. It is seen
from Fig. 2 that the distribution function peaks at ε = ~ω/2. The positron energy spread

40 µm, n0 = 1019 cm−3 and γd ≈

2Rpc ≈

increase as r increase. The probability of the pair production by the photon crossed the

bubble with r = 20 µm is about 1.5. It is of the order of the pair production probability by

the photon passed the same distance (

0.8 cm) in the ﬁeld maximum of Ge crystal cooled

≈

to 100 K [13].

In Conclusion we have calculated the radiation spectrum of energetic electrons and the

probability of pair production by a hard photon in a strong plasma wakeﬁeld. Like crystals

[1] a plasma can be a very eﬃcient radiator for high energy electrons as well as an intense

positron source. Moreover, a plasma wakeﬁeld has some advantages over crystalline and

laser ﬁelds because it is a large-scale structure by comparison. The intense crystalline
ﬁeld is located in very narrow layer (. 10−4 µm) about the crystallographic axis and the

intense laser radiation varies over the laser wavelength (. 1 µm). The width of the high

energy electron beam is typically ten microns and more [9] that is close to the plasma

cavity size. This provides more eﬃcient interaction of the electron beam with strong plasma

wakeﬁeld than with strong crystalline and laser ﬁelds. In addition, the ponderomotive force

of the intense laser pulse pushes out the electrons from the region with strong laser ﬁeld,

whereas the plasma wakeﬁeld focuses the electron beam. It should be noted that the plasma

8

wakeﬁeld can be used as a high-gradient accelerating structure [7, 9] that open possibility

for developing of the compact photon and positron source.

Radiation losses in the plasma-based accelerators increase as ε2 in the classical limit

and strongly aﬀect dynamics of energetic electrons [17, 18]. We found that the radiation
ε2/3 in the quantum limit, which will be achievable in future plasma-based

losses scale as

∝

high-energy accelerators. Other quantum eﬀects (eﬀects accompanying collisions of charged

particles [19], vacuum breakdown [4, 20], photon splitting, etc.) can be important in a very

strong plasma ﬁeld.

ABSTRACT

In an eﬀort to understand the fundamental physics of turbulent transport
of particles and heat in a tokamak, the ﬂoating potential ﬂuctuations in the
the scrape-oﬀ layer plasma of ohmically heated ADITYA tokamak are anal-
ysed for self-similarity using distribution function approach. It is observed
that the distribution function of a sum of n data points converges to a L´evy
distribution of scale index, α = 1.111 for n ≤ 40 and α = 2.0 for larger n.
In both scaling ranges, the edge ﬂuctuation is self-similar. This observation
is backed by several supporting evidences. The results indicate that the
small scale ﬂuctuations transport matter and heat dominantly by convec-
tion whereas the transport due to large scale ﬂuctuations is by a diﬀusive
process.

Experimental observations [1] and numerical simulations [2] have shown
that random ﬂuctuations in the edge plasma of a tokamak exhibit a ten-
dency to organize themselves into coherent structures. These structures are
expected to play an important role in causing transport of particles, a topic
of considerable interest in modern fusion devices. The measurement of ﬂuc-
tuation induced particle ﬂux shows bursty nature [3]. An attempt has been
made to explain the bursty nature of particle transport in terms of self or-
ganized criticality (SOC) as indicated by the observation of long range time
correlation and self similarity in the ﬂuctuation data [4]. However, whether
or not the long range correlation is a manifestation of SOC (and a break-
down of the standard transport paradigm) is an open question [5].

In this paper, we carry out an additional investigation of bursty nature
of particle transport in tokamak in terms of L´evy ﬂights. The paradigm of
L´evy ﬂight has been used recently to explain anomalous transport in such
diverse subjects as ﬂuid dynamics [6], transient polymers [7], subrecoil laser
cooling [8], human heart beat [9], movement of stocks in ﬁnancial markets
[10,11] and ﬂuid turbulence [12]. The L´evy scale index, α is intimately re-
lated to the index, ν of the transport equation : < R2(t) >= Dtν, where
< R2(t) > is the mean square distance travelled by the test particle in the
random ﬁeld in time t and D is the transport coeﬃcient. For a diﬀusive
In gen-
transport, ν = 1 whereas ν > 1 indicates anomalous transport.
eral, α = 2/ν and hence 0 ≤ α < 2 represents anomalous transport [13].
To demonstrate L´evy process and the resultant self- similarity, we have fol-
lowed the approach of probability distribution function (PDF) [10,11]. This
approach is superior because the PDF involves the entire range of ﬂuctu-
ation amplitude unlike the rescaled range (R/S) analysis which essentially
describes the two point function of the PDF [4]. We provide evidence of a
self- similar non-Gaussian process, which is a L´evy process, over a range of
time scales up to 3 times the correlation time (τac). At longer time scales the
process is Gaussian. The observation implies a new paradigm of turbulent
transport in tokamaks, viz., anomalous transport at short time scales and
diﬀusive transport at larger time scales.

It has been shown by L´evy [14] that the sum of n independent stochastic
variables, with a probability distribution having power-law wings, converges
to a stable process characterized by the L´evy distribution. The process
n
i=1 Xi, of the stochastic
is stable because the PDF of the sum, Zn =
variables {X}, has the same functional form as the PDF of Xi. The PDF

where α (0 < α ≤ 2) and γ(> 0) are the scale index and scale factor
respectively. If the central region of the distribution is well described by a
L´evy stable process, then the the probability of return to the origin is given
by [10]:

where Γ is a Gamma function. The L´evy stable symmetrical distributions

Although L´evy stable process is characterized by inﬁnite variance, the exis-

tence of ﬁnite variance in physical systems is treated either by introduction
of spatiotemporal coupling [13] or by means of truncated L´evy distribution
(TLD) where an exponential tail is imposed on the values of the stochastic
variable [15,16]. The TLD is a L´evy stable process. In this paper, we re-
port the evidence of a L´evy stable process in the turbulent edge plasma of
ohmically heated ADITYA tokamak.

For this experiment, ADITYA tokamak is operated with with the follow-
ing discharge parameters: plasma current, Ip = 64±4 kA, toroidal magnetic
ﬁeld at axis, BT = 0.75 T, chord averaged plasma density, ¯ne = 1×1019m−3,
major radius ,R0 = 0.75 m, minor radius, a= 0.25 m. The ﬂoating potential
is measured using a poloidal array of Langmuir probes made up of moly-
denum wires (length = 3.5 mm, diameter= 1 mm, separation= 3 mm) and
located in the Scrape-oﬀ layer plasma 3 mm behind the limiter. The probes
on a movable shaft are mounted on the top port, toroidally 72o away from
the limiter in the electron side. The data are aquired at a sampling rate
of 1 MHz in the time window 25-49 ms. The mean potential lies between
-4 to 1 volts. The ﬂuctuation data are generated after removing the 1 ms
running average. With this procedure, we expect to remove the very low fre-
quency ﬂuctuations which are not part of plasma turbulence. A stationary

3

segment of data during 35-49 ms are chosen from seven discharges (8746-48
and 8752-55) for further analysis. The autocorrelation time, τac= 12 µs. The
autocorrelation function falls sharply and crosses zero at about t/τac = 2
with no evidence of algebric tail.

For further analysis, stationary ﬂuctuation time series from 7 discharges
are normalized with their root mean square (RMS) amplitude and stacked
together. The distribution function is obtained using 980000 data points.
This is shown in Fig.(1), together with a Gaussian having the same vari-
ables. The PDF of the ﬂuctuation is nearly symmetrical (skewness = -0.38)
but has a non-neglible kurtosis (1.24). The evidence of high kurtosis is seen
in the distribution peaked near the origin. We next try to ﬁt the PDF of
the ﬂuctuations data to a L´evy distribution.

In order to determine the L´evy scale index α, the number of convolu-
tions is chosen in the logarithmic intervals, n = 2i−1, where i =1,2, ... 11.
The original time series is divided into non-overlapping blocks of n data
points and a new variable, Zn is generated for each block. The new time
series is then subjected to L´evy analysis. The probability of return to ori-
gin, p(Zn = 0) is plotted as a function of n. This is done for the following
reasons: (i) the distribution function is most accurate at Zn = 0, and (ii)
the analytical form of only p(Zn = 0) is known [Eq.(2)]. It is observed that
on a log-log plot (Fig. 2), there are two clear slopes with values -0.9 and
-0.5 in the n-ranges 1-40 and 40-500 respectively. The slope with value -0.9
corresponds to L´evy index α = 1.111 and that with value -0.5 to α = 2.0.
The values of the scale factor, γ in the two scaling ranges are 0.64±0.06
and 8.03±0.76 respectively. It is important to note that the cross-over to a
Gaussian process takes place at n = nx = 40 which is much larger than that
expected form the central limit theorem [17].

In Fig.(3a) we compare the PDF observed for n=1 with the L´evy sta-
ble distribution of the scale index, α=1.111 and scale factor, γ=0.59. The
L´evy distribution is a good ﬁt in the central region of the PDF upto 3σ
values of the stochastic variable. Beyond 3σ, the PDF departs from both
L´evy and Gaussian forms. Note that the values of α and γ are obtained
in the self-similarity range of n=1-32 µs. This range represents small scale
ﬂuctuations in the ﬂoating potential. Figure 3(b) shows the full distribution
function for the n−values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. As the number of con-
volutions increases, the distribution function becomes broad and the peak

4

value (or, the probability of return to origin) decreases.
If the stochastic
variable, Zn and the distribution function, p(Zn) are rescaled in accordance
with Eq.(3) and Eq.(4) respectively, the distribution functions, ps(Zs) col-
lapse on n =1 distribution (Fig. 3(c)). Thus, the distribution functions
of diﬀerent convolutions are self-similar in the range n =1 to 32. A self-
similarity is also obtained for n−values 64, 128, 256 and 512 by using α=2.0
and γ=8.03±0.76. Figure 4 shows the rescaled distribution functions in the
two scaling regimes on the same graph. The diﬀerence of log(ps(Zs = 0))
values in the ﬁrst and the second scaling regimes provides a measure of the
’distance’, ∆ between the two scaling regimes [15]. The ∆ ≈ 0.6 for the
results shown in Fig. 4 indicates that the ’distance’ is signiﬁcantly large.

We have veriﬁed the above results by carrying out the following anal-
ysis: (i) the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the stochastic variable
(Zn), σZn shows a power-law behaviour, σZn ∼ nν/2. The exponent, ν=1.8
in the short time scaling range (n=1-32) whereas, ν=1.0 in the long time
scaling range (n=100-800). Thus, the small scale ﬂuctuations show non-
Gaussian PDF and a self-similar scaling behaviour. The long scales show
self-similarity of Gaussian type. It can be argued that the RMS amplitude
of potential ﬂuctuation is proportional to the root mean square distance
travelled by a test particle in the random ﬁeld [18]. (ii) the rescaled range
(R/S) analysis on the combined data set shows a somewhat longer scaling
range at short time scales (n= 1-128) having Hurst parameter, H=0.9. At
long time scales, n=256-4096, the value of H = 0.6. One is tempted to
interpret it as an evidence of long range self-smilarity of non-Gaussian type.
However, it should be pointed out that R/S range analysis has tendency to
give somewhat higher values of H [19]. Therefore, we consider that at long
time range, the ﬂuctuation data show self-similarity of Gaussian type. (iii)
when we calculate the kurtosis (K) of the time series corresponding to dif-
ferent convolutions (n), it is observed that kurtosis decreases with increasing
n and K < 0.2 for n > 60. This result is similar to those reported earlier
in tokamak [20] and stellerator [21]. Thus, the small scale ﬂuctuations are
non-Gaussian whereas the large scales are Gaussian.

In conclusion, we have presented evidences of a L´evy stable process in
tokamak edge turbulence. The sum of n data points of a ﬂuctuation time
series converges to a L´evy distribution of scale index, α=1.111 for n ≤ 40
and α= 2.0 for larger n. The probability distribution functions are self sim-
ilar in both scaling ranges. This observation is backed by several supporting

5

evidences.

We ﬁnally give a possible interpretation of these observations and spec-
ulate on their implication for the problem of bursty transport due to turbu-
lence in the tokamak edge region. We have earlier carried out conditional
statistical analysis of Langmuir probe data in the edge of tokamak ADITYA
(for similar discharges) and shown that the ﬂuctuations are dominated by
coherent structures which appear intermittently in space and time, typically
lasting 25-30 µs and having poloidal scale lengths of a few cm. These struc-
tures are also associated with sharp radial potential gradients separating
the last closed magnetic surface from the scrape-oﬀ layer plasma. Bursts
of turbulent transport into the scrape-oﬀ layers are related to intermittent
breakdown of radial conﬁnement and the coherent structures extending into
the open ﬁeld line regions. We believe that the non-gaussian PDFs of po-
tential ﬂuctuation (φ) described above are due to such coherent structures.
For time scales longer than the life time (≈ 25-30 µs), we observe only a
randomized average behaviour and hence infer only Gaussian statistics and
diﬀusive behaviour. For shorter time scales, on the other hand, convective
eﬀects due to coherent structures dominate and we observe the anomalous
behaviour, < R2 >∼ tν with ν=1.8. We may also make an estimate of the
enhancement of turbulent transport due to convective eﬀects introduced by
the presence of coherent eddy-like structures by using the analysis of Rosen-
[22]. The enhancement factor f = D∗/D ∼ P 1/2 where the
bluth et al.
Peclet number P ∼ vd/D is the ratio of the diﬀusion time to the eddy turn-
over time. For a typical eddy size of d ∼ 1 cm, the typical eddy velocity,
v ∼ cE/B ∼ 105 cm/s and diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D ∼ 104 cm2/s [1,23], we
ﬁnd an enhancement factor f ∼ 3. Thus, the presence of transient coherent
eddies can give sudden avalanche- like enhancements of transport by a factor
of 3 or more, resulting in bursty nature of transport.

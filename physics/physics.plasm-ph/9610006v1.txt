Abstract

Resistive steady states in toroidal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where

Ohm’s law must be taken into account, diﬀer considerably from ideal ones.

Only for special (and probably unphysical) resistivity proﬁles can the Lorentz

force, in the static force-balance equation, be expressed as the gradient of a

scalar and thus cancel the gradient of a scalar pressure. In general, the Lorentz

force has a curl directed so as to generate toroidal vorticity. Here, we calculate,

for a collisional, highly viscous magnetoﬂuid, the ﬂows that are required for an

axisymmetric toroidal steady state, assuming uniform scalar resistivity and

viscosity. The ﬂows originate from paired toroidal vortices (in what might

be called a “double smoke ring” conﬁguration), and are thought likely to be

ubiquitous in the interior of toroidally driven magnetoﬂuids of this type. The

existence of such vortices is conjectured to characterize magnetoﬂuids beyond

the high-viscosity limit in which they are readily calculable.

I. INTRODUCTION

If static solutions of the MHD equations in toroidal geometry are forced to obey Ohm’s

law as well as force balance, most of them disappear. The reason is that the current den-

sities resulting from inductively generated, steady electric ﬁelds, give the term j×B in the

equation of motion (where j is the electric current density and B is the magnetic ﬁeld) a

ﬁnite curl, and thus j×B cannot be balanced by the gradient of a scalar pressure.1 The only

exceptions, for ﬁnite, uniform transport coeﬃcients and incompressible MHD, involve resis-

tivity proﬁles which are not uniform on a magnetic ﬂux surface, and thus may be thought

unrealizeable.2 Earlier, it was speculated1 that if toroidal MHD steady states exist for resis-

tive magnetoﬂuids, they will probably involve ﬂows (vector velocity ﬁelds). Here, we wish to

calculate and describe such velocity ﬁelds for the case of large plasma viscosity (low viscous

Lundquist number). We stress that the eﬀect we are describing is a consequence of toroidal

geometry, and is not an issue in the “straight cylinder” approximation. Vortices similar

to the ones found here can appear in straight-cylinder MHD computations but only above

instability thresholds.3,4 In the toroidal case, the vortices are an integral part of the force

balance in the steady state all the time, and are not uniquely connected with instabilities.

In Sec. II, the governing MHD equations are written out, and an approximate method

of solution valid in the limit of large viscosity (low viscous Lundquist number) is discussed.

With our approach, the velocity ﬁelds necessary to maintain axisymmetric, toroidal, resis-

tive steady states are determined. In Sec. III, numerical implementation of the procedure

is described, and vorticity contours and streamlines resulting from the calculations are pre-

sented. We believe the results may suggest a simultaneous occurrence of current circuits

and vortex rings in a ﬁnitely electrically conducting ﬂuid that goes well beyond this single

tractable example. Sec. IV is a summary and suggestion for further investigations. The Ap-

pendix describes, in terms of inequalities among dimensionless Reynolds-like numbers, the

approximations made and also speciﬁes the geometry in detail. Purely for computational

convenience, we specialize to a toroid with a rectangular cross section (see the Appendix

2

and Fig. 1). However, we believe our results to apply to toroids with more general boundary

shapes.

II. A HIGH-VISCOSITY CALCULATION

The MHD equation of motion for a uniform-density, incompressible magnetoﬂuid is5

· ∇

2v,

− ∇

∇

where v is the ﬂuid velocity, p is the pressure, and ν is the kinematic viscosity. We work in

standard “Alfv´enic” dimensionless units, so that in fact ν is the reciprocal of a Reynolds-

like number; speciﬁcally, ν−1 is the viscous Lundquist number, given in terms of quantities

expressed in cgs units by

(1)

(2)

ν = CaL/˜ν,

where Ca is an Alfv´en speed based on the mean poloidal magnetic ﬁeld, L is a characteristic

length scale which can be taken to be a toroidal minor radius, and ˜ν is the laboratory

kinematic viscosity, expressed in cm2/s. We assume that the magnetoﬂuid is incompressible,

and that the viscosity and electrical conductivity are spatially uniform scalars. These are

all signiﬁcantly restrictive assumptions, but they will be seen to lead to a tractable problem

in otherwise uncharted territory.

The most severe assumption we will make is that of small viscous Lundquist number.

For a collision-dominated plasma, with a mean free path smaller than an ion gyroradius, ˜ν

is essentially the ion mean free path times an ion thermal speed. It is also the “ion parallel

viscosity” for the case in which the mean free path is greater than a gyroradius,6,7 as it is

in the case of a tokamak fusion device. For the current generation of tokamaks, ˜ν is an ex-

traordinarily large number, so large as to cast legitimate doubt on the applicability of either

version of the MHD viscous stress tensor to tokamak dynamics. Considerable discussion

and some controversy has surrounded the form and magnitude of the appropriate viscous

3

stress tensor to be used in tokamak MHD, and at present, these discussions show no signs of

converging. We must admit our own doubts about the accuracy of MHD for tokamaks with

any currently available viscous stress tensor, but for purposes of this discussion, we make

the assumption that the standard isotropic viscous-stress tensor [used in the derivation of

Eq. (1)] is applicable, but with a viscosity coeﬃcient suﬃciently large as to make the viscous

Lundquist number [1/ν in Eq. (1)] small compared to unity: i.e., ˜ν is of the order of an

ion mean free path times an ion thermal speed for the case of a plasma. In any case, the

assumption made may be satisﬁed in other magnetoﬂuids and may be considered of possible

relevance to tokamaks, at least until some more convincing approximation for the viscous

stress tensor appears.

This assumption makes it possible to treat the viscous term as of the same order as the

other two terms on the right hand side of Eq. (1), and further makes it possible to neglect

the inertial terms [the left hand side of Eq. (1)] for time-independent states. A detailed

justiﬁcation in terms of dimensionless numbers is given in the Appendix. The velocity v is

then to be calculated in terms of j and B from the approximate relation

p

−

j×B = ν

2v,

∇

where to lowest order, j and B are to be obtained strictly from Ohm’s and Amp`ere’s laws

and the magnetic boundary conditions, without reference to v. The term containing velocity

in Eq. (3) needs to be retained in order to balance the part of the left hand side that has

a non-vanishing curl. The resistivity and viscosity are to be taken as spatially uniform, so

that taking the divergence of Eq. (3) would give, using the incompressibility assumption,

2p =

∇ ·

(j×B) ,

a Poisson equation for the pressure that determines p as a functional of j and B. The

pressure can also be made to drop out of Eq. (3) by taking the curl and writing the result

as an inhomogeneous equation to be solved for the vorticity ω =

We shall ﬁnd that in the geometry considered, the vorticity vector points entirely in the

(toroidal) ϕ-direction; see the Appendix. Once the ﬂuid velocity and the vorticity are

determined by solving Eqs. (3) and (5) (v and ω are, as advertised, “small” in the sense of

being ﬁrst order in 1/ν), one can return with them to Ohm’s and Amp`ere’s laws and iterate

again, obtaining ﬁrst-order corrections to the current and magnetic ﬁeld. Then, corrections

to v and ω can be obtained by going back again to Eqs. (3) and (5), and iterating. Our

interest here, though, is in the lowest order solutions for the velocity and vorticity.

The electric ﬁeld, highly idealized for tractability, is regarded as being generated by a

time-proportional axial magnetic ﬁeld conﬁned to a high permeability cylinder (a cylindri-

cal iron core, say) whose axis of symmetry is the z-axis, and which extends to inﬁnity in

the positive and negative z directions. This cylinder lies entirely within the “hole in the

doughnut” of the toroid and is perpendicular to the mid-plane z = 0. It produces an electric

ﬁeld which lies purely in the azimuthal direction [ϕ-direction in cylindrical polar coordinates

(r, ϕ, z), which we use throughout]: E = (E0r0/r) ˆeϕ, where E0 is the strength of the applied

electric ﬁeld at a reference radius r = r0 within the toroid. Ohm’s law, in the dimensionless

units, is (with a resistive Lundquist number 1/η)

E + v×B = ηj,

(6)

so that if we neglect v to lowest order, a purely toroidal current density is generated with the

form j = (E0r0/ηr) ˆeϕ. The (poloidal) magnetic ﬁeld associated with this j is determined by

Amp`ere’s law and by boundary conditions, which we take to be B

ˆn = 0 at the toroidal walls,

·

where ˆn is the unit normal. We assume that the toroidal boundaries are highly conducting

and coated with a thin layer of insulator; we ignore the slits and slots in the conducting

walls that are required for the applied electric ﬁeld to penetrate the interior of the toroid:

a necessary and common if regrettable idealization. We return presently to the explicit

calculation of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. In addition, we may assume the presence of a

vacuum toroidal magnetic ﬁeld that is externally supported: BT = Bϕˆeϕ = (B0r0/r) ˆeϕ. The

total magnetic ﬁeld is the sum of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic ﬁelds. The toroidal

5

magnetic ﬁeld seems to play little role in establishing the properties of the equilibrium,

though it will have a great deal to say about the stability of that equilibrium, a question

which we do not consider here. The magnetic ﬁeld lines are, topologically speaking, helical;

but the toroidal ﬁeld enters in no other context, and the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld contains

all the nontrivial magnetic information. The toroidal magnetic ﬁeld would also play a much

more prominent role if a tensor electrical conductivity were allowed. A tensor electrical

conductivity, which we do not consider, would permit lowest-order poloidal currents as well;

this limitation would be desirable to remove in future treatments. At the next order, poloidal

currents would also be implied by the cross product of v with the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld.

It is to be stressed that until the velocity ﬁeld begins to feature in the calculation, the

mathematics are indistinguishable from a similar low-frequency electrodynamics calculation

in a ﬁnitely conducting ring of metal. It is shown in the Appendix that the condition for

the negligibility of v in Ohm’s law at the lowest order is again the smallness of the viscous

Lundquist number, not a totally obvious result.

Before computing the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld explicitly, we return to Eq. (5) and examine

how the vorticity ω may be determined once the left hand side is known. Since the Laplacian

of a vector in the toroidal direction that only depends on poloidal coordinates is also a vector

in the toroidal direction that only depends on poloidal coordinates, we essentially have a

Poisson equation to solve for ω = ωϕˆeϕ. One way to proceed is to expand ω in a family of

vector eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, which are related to waveguide modes:

2 (ωϕˆeϕ) + λ2 (ωϕˆeϕ) = 0.

∇

All components of all ﬁelds are axisymmetric (i.e., the components of all vector ﬁelds are

ϕ-independent), and the solution to Eq. (7) is any one of the functions:

where εjk, γjk, Djk and k are undetermined constants, with γjk, k and λjk related by the

condition λ2

jk = γ2

jk + k2. Here, J1 and Y1 are Bessel and Weber functions, respectively. The

(7)

(8)

6

vorticity may be written in terms of a velocity stream function ψ(r, z) in the following way:

ωϕˆeϕ =

2 (ψˆeϕ/r). The function ψ/r may also be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions

−∇

obtained from Eqs. (7) and (8). The boundary conditions chosen are that ψ and ωϕ, and

thus the ωjk, vanish on the boundary. We now choose a rectangular cross section for the

toroid; the combined boundary conditions v

ˆn = 0 and ωϕ = 0 make the velocity ﬁeld

·

satisfy stress-free, impenetrable boundary conditions. That is, v

ˆn and the tangential

·

viscous stress are zero on all four faces. These are the only boundary-shape and internally

consistent viscous boundary conditions (perfectly smooth and impenetrable walls) we have

found for which the solution is obtainable by elementary means. However, we believe the

qualitative conclusions to be reached will apply to essentially an arbitrary toroidal boundary

shape.

We seek a solution to Eq. (5) by expanding ωϕ in terms of the eigenfunctions, ωjk, having

determined numerically the allowed values of εjk, γjk, Djk and k. The value of εjk is chosen

so that the two-dimensional integral of the square of the eigenfunctions is unity. We assume

that what we have obtained, then, is a complete orthonormal set. We write

it is clear that A and B can be determined by the previous procedure: solving Eq. (12) by

expanding in the same eigenfunctions (A = 0 on the wall) and diﬀerentiating. In the next

section, we adopt an alternative and slightly simpler procedure to determine B. It is already

clear, however, what the form is that the vorticity ﬁeld will have to take, simply by looking

at the source term in the Poisson equation for vorticity and noting the fact that the radial

component of B will be positive above the mid-plane and negative below. The vorticity

distribution will look dipolar in the (r, z)-plane, and the three-dimensional vortices will be

vortex rings that sit one on top of the other, above and below the mid-plane: a “double

smoke ring” conﬁguration.

III. EXPLICIT NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS

In this section, we determine the poloidal vector ﬁelds Bp and v for this MHD system.

These ﬁelds are associated with a toroidal current density that is proportional to 1/r, where

r is the distance from the toroidal axis. For illustrative purposes, we consider a toroid with

a rectangular cross section (see Fig. 1). We assume the boundaries to lie at the planes

z =

L and at the radii r = r− and r = r+, where r−

r+.

In our calculations,

±

all length scales are normalized to the major radius r0

(r− + r+)/2. Since we do not

r

≤

≤

≡

assume large aspect ratio, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the lengths of the major

and minor radii. Because the walls of the toroid are idealized as perfect conductors, the

appropriate magnetic boundary condition for this problem is that the normal component of

the magnetic ﬁeld vanish there. To ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld we solve for the magnetic ﬂux

function χ directly. In terms of χ, both the vector potential and the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld

can be easily derived. Once Bp is known, the source term

×(j×B) on the left side of

∇

Eq. (5) can be computed, and the resulting Poisson equation solved for the vorticity. With

the vorticity, the velocity stream function, ψ, and ﬁnally the velocity v can also be found.

8

With axisymmetry, the poloidal component of the magnetic ﬁeld Bp may be represented

in terms of a magnetic ﬂux function χ(r, z) according to

Substituting this into Amp`ere’s law,

×B = j, with j = (E0r0/ηr) ˆeϕ yields

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

It is regrettable that nearly all experiments performed during the last several years

on MHD in toroidal geometry have been carried out in tokamaks intended to conﬁne a

thermonuclear plasma. Not only are diagnostics for such internal variables as ﬂuid velocity,

vorticity, and electric current density very limited due to the high temperatures, the detailed

applicability of MHD itself is in doubt because of previously-mentioned uncertainties in the

appropriate viscous stress tensor to be used in theoretical models. Here, we have attempted

to isolate an interesting MHD eﬀect, without taking a position on whether it should or

should not be an important feature of tokamak operation. Tokamaks are often thought

to have both overall poloidal and toroidal rotation, which have been attributed to various

consequences of local charge non-neutrality. The combinations of all three kinds of ﬂows, if

they were present, might be quite diﬃcult to untangle.

The “double smoke ring” conﬁguration identiﬁed in this paper is a feature associated with

12

electrically-driven toroidal magnetoﬂuids that we believe is quite robust; it does not require

local charge non-neutrality, and may even appear in liquid metal experiments (for example),

even though the high-viscosity calculations we have done imply inequalities that may not

be easily satisﬁed in liquid metals. Entirely as a consequence of the toroidal geometry,

a purely toroidal electric current generates a magnetic ﬁeld for which a part of the j×B

Lorentz force produces a local toroidally-directed torque on the magnetoﬂuid. (This torque

disappears in the “straight-cylinder” limit.) This gives rise to opposing pairs of vortex rings

with vorticity aligned parallel and anti-parallel to the current density. We believe that

these structures will exist under a variety of boundary conditions (non-conducting walls,

for example, with no-slip boundary conditions) and will not require low Hartmann numbers

or viscous Lundquist numbers, though the ﬂows may be more elaborate (involving, say,

poloidal currents or toroidal velocities as well) when the inequalities we have invoked are

not satisﬁed.

The likely presence of MHD ﬂows in toroidal geometry was probably ﬁrst reported in an

unpublished paper by Pﬁrsch and Schl¨uter8 over thirty years ago. Their approach was quite

diﬀerent from ours, involving for example an inverse aspect ratio expansion. In addition,

they ignored the velocity ﬁeld in the equation of motion (but not in Ohm’s law). On the

basis of their model, Pﬁrsch and Schl¨uter concluded that there would be a necessary mass

ﬂux outward from the toroid that required “sources” of mass inside the toroid. Here, we

have explicitly exhibited a large class of solutions with no normal component of velocity at

the walls, which contradicts the ﬁndings of Pﬁrsch and Schl¨uter. Nevertheless, credit for

the observation that ﬂows are to be expected in the steady state must go to them. Ideal

toroidal vortices have been considered by Marnachev.9

The ﬂow pattern that we have been computed in this paper, with streamlines that cross

the toroid near the mid-plane, is not one that is very propitious for plasma conﬁnement

with high temperatures in the center of the toroid, and lower temperatures near the wall.

Nevertheless, the ability to “stir” the interior of a toroidal magnetoﬂuid with externally-

maintained electric ﬁelds might have other applications of some interest, such as in the

13

cooling of alloys.10 More generally, the likely separation of driven MHD states into those

involving velocity ﬁelds and those which are static seems artiﬁcial to us. In this particular

example, we have found velocity ﬁelds that do not arise because of any instability or mal-

function, but are an inherent part of the equilibrium itself, even though no external pressure

gradients are applied.

APPENDIX: REYNOLDS-LIKE NUMBERS AND GEOMETRY

· ∇

· ∇

In this Appendix, we consider in detail the inequalities that justify the neglect to lowest-

order of v

v and v×B in Eqs. (1) and (6), respectively. We also specify the assumed

toroidal geometry of the ﬁelds B, j, v, and ω.

Proceeding from the dimensional (cgs units) version of Eq. (1), the condition for ne-

glecting the v

v term relative to the viscous term is low viscous Reynolds number. This

Reynolds number is deﬁned as vL/˜ν, where v is a typical ﬂuid velocity, L is a typical length

scale, and ˜ν is a kinematic viscosity. We take the minor toroidal radius as the typical length

scale for this problem. Using the dimensional version of Eq. (5), we may estimate v as CaM,

where Ca is an Alfv´en speed based on a typical poloidal magnetic-ﬁeld strength B, and

where M is the viscous Lundquist number, CaL/˜ν. Inserting this in the viscous Reynolds

number requirement, we see that the justiﬁcation of Eq. (5) follows from the smallness of

the square of M compared to unity.

Neglect of the velocity term in Eq. (6) is justiﬁed by requiring the velocity v to be small

compared to η/L. The parameter η is the magnetic diﬀusivity, deﬁned by η = c2/4πσ,

where σ is the electrical conductivity. Using the previous estimate for v, we see that this

inequality is equivalent to SM << 1, where S is the resistive Lundquist number, CaL/η.

14

Since SM

H 2, where H is the Hartmann number, an equivalent statement of the second

≡

inequality is that H 2 is much less than one. Thus, the smallness of the squares of M and H

compared to unity is enough to justify the approximations made.

Throughout this paper, we work exclusively in cylindrical polar coordinates (r, ϕ, z).

The axis of symmetry is the z-axis, and the mid-plane of the toroid is z = 0. The ϕ-

direction is the “toroidal” direction, and the r and z directions are called the “poloidal”

directions. (See Fig. 1.) For the numerical solutions presented in Sec. III, we consider a

toroid with a rectangular cross section in the (r, z)-plane. The boundaries are idealized

as perfectly smooth, perfectly conducting rigid walls, with zero normal velocity and zero

tangential viscous stress. We imagine that the inside surfaces of the boundaries are coated

with an inﬁnitesimally thin layer of insulator (other idealizations are possible, such as a

purely non-conducting boundary). In most experimental toroidal devices, gaps are present

in the conducting boundary to permit the penetration of a toroidal electric ﬁeld. The

asymmetric eﬀects introduced by these slits and slots, however, are not included in our

model. An externally-supported toroidal (vacuum) magnetic ﬁeld is possible, but will not

feature in the analysis until a stability calculation or dynamical simulation is performed.

The nontrivial (poloidal) magnetic ﬁeld, Bp, therefore has only r and z components. The

current density j has only a ϕ-component, the vorticity ω has only a ϕ-component, and the

ﬂuid velocity v has only r and z components. It is shown in Sec. III that the mechanical

ﬂow is a (double) “vortex ring” conﬁguration, and the electric current is a (single) “current

loop.” The scalar pressure p will depend only upon r and z. The simple form of the ﬁelds in

this model is a consequence of two assumptions: (i) axisymmetry; and (ii) isotropic scalar

viscosity and conductivity. The introduction of a tensor conductivity or viscosity moves the

problem out of the realm of present tractability.

Note that the part of the j×B term in Eq. (3) that contains a curl is of ﬁrst order in the

inverse aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of minor and major radii of the toroidal system). The

results of this paper, however, are not predicated on the assumption that the inverse aspect

ratio is small compared to one.

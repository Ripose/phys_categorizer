Abstract

Intermittency in ﬂuid turbulence can be emphasized through the analysis of Probability
Distribution Functions (PDF) for velocity ﬂuctuations, which display a strong non–gaussian
behavior at small scales. Castaing et al. (1990) have introduced the idea that this behavior can
be represented, in the framework of a multiplicative cascade model, by a convolution of gaussians
whose variances is distributed according to a log–normal distribution. In this letter we have tried
to test this conjecture on the MHD solar wind turbulence by performing a ﬁt of the PDF of the
bulk speed and magnetic ﬁeld intensity ﬂuctuations calculated in the solar wind, with the model.
This ﬁt allows us to calculate a parameter λ2 depending on the scale, which represents the width
of the log–normal distribution of the variances of the gaussians. The physical implications of the
obtained values of the parameter as well as of its scaling law are ﬁnally discussed.

Introduction

The statistics of turbulent ﬂuid ﬂows can be characterized by the Probability Distribution Function (PDF)
of velocity diﬀerences over varying scales (Frisch, 1995, and references therein). At large scales the PDF is ap-
proximately Gaussian, as the scale decreases, the wings of the distribution become increasingly stretched, so that
large deviations from the average value are present. This phenomenon, usually ascribed to intermittency, has been
observed and deeply investigated in ﬂuid ﬂows (Frisch, 1995, and references therein), and recently also in Magneto-
hydrodynamic (MHD) ﬂows (see for example Biskamp, 1993; Marsch and Tu, 1997). Intermittency in MHD ﬂows
has been analyzed mainly by using satellite measurements of solar wind ﬂuctuations (Burlaga, 1991; Marsch and
Liu, 1993; Carbone et al., 1995, 1996; Ruzmaikin et al., 1995; Horbury et al., 1997), or by using high resolution 2D
numerical simulations (Politano et al., 1998) and Shell Models (Biskamp, 1993, Carbone, 1994). All these analysis
deal with the scaling exponents of structure functions, aimed to show that they follow anomalous scaling laws which
can be compared with the usual energy cascade models for turbulence.

The non gaussian nature of PDF in MHD solar wind turbulence has been evidentiated by Marsch and Tu (1994).
In order to investigate the properties of intermittency through the analysis of non gaussian character of PDF, it
would be necessary to quantify the departure of PDF from gaussian statistics and to analyze how this departure
depends on the scale. Because of the idea of self–similarity underlying the energy cascade process in turbulence,
Castaing and co–workers (Castaing et al., 1990) introduced a model which tries to characterize the behavior of the
PDF’s through the scaling law of a parameter describing how the shape of the PDF changes in going towards small
scales (Vassilicos, 1995). In its simpler form the model can be introduced by saying that the PDF of the increments
δψ (representing here both velocity and magnetic ﬂuctuations) at a given scale τ , is made by a convolution of the

2

(1)

typical Gaussian distribution PG, with a function Gτ (σ) which represents the weight of the gaussian distribution
characterized by the variance σ

Pτ (δψ) =

Gτ (σ) PG (δψ, σ) dσ

Z

In the usual approach where the energy cascade is introduced through a fragmentation process, σ is directly related
to the local energy transfer rate ǫ. In a self–similar situation, where the energy cascade generates only a scaling
variation of σ =< δψ2 >1/2 according to the classical Kolmogorov’s picture (Frisch, 1995), Gτ (σ) reduces to a
Dirac function Gτ (σ) = δ(σ
σ0). In this case from eq. (1) a Gaussian distribution Pτ (δψ) = PG(δψ, σ0) is recast.
On the contrary when the cascade is not strictly self–similar, the width of the distribution Gτ is diﬀerent from
zero. In this way the scaling behavior of the width (which takes into account the height of the PDF’s wings) can
be used to characterize intermittency. In the present paper we will try to see if the departure from the gaussian
statistics can be described within the framework of the cascade model (1).

Solar Wind Observations

The satellite observations of both velocity and magnetic ﬁeld in the interplanetary space, oﬀer us an almost
unique possibility to gain information on the turbulent MHD state in a very large scale range, say from 1 AU
(Astronomical Units) up to 103 km. Since the aim of this letter is essentially to show that the PDF of solar
wind ﬂuctuations can be represented by the model (1), we limit to analyse only plasma measurements of the
bulk velocity V (t) and magnetic ﬁeld intensity B(t). The detailed analysis of single velocity and magnetic ﬁeld
components ﬂuctuations is left for a more extended work.

We based our analysis on plasma measurements as recorded by the instruments on board Helios 2 during its
primary mission in the inner heliosphere. The analysis period refers to the ﬁrst 4 months of 1976 when the spacecraft
orbited from 1 AU, on day 17, to 0.29 AU on day 108. The original data were collected in 81 s bins and we choose a
set of subintervals of 2 days each. The subintervals were selected separately within low speed regions and high speed
regions. Fast wind was chosen having care of selecting a two–day interval within the trailing edge of each high speed
stream. The choice was such that the average value of the wind speed was never below 550 km/sec for all the ”fast”
intervals. Slow wind was selected picking up two–day intervals just before the stream–stream interface having care
that the average speed value was never above 450 km/sec for each interval. For each subinterval we calculated the
velocity and magnetic increments at a given scale τ through δVτ = V (t+τ )
B(t), which
represent characteristic ﬂuctuations across eddies at the scale τ . Then we normalize each variable to the standard
deviation within each subinterval δvτ = δVτ /[< (δVτ )2 >]1/2 and δbτ = δBτ /[< (δBτ )2 >]1/2 (brackets being
average within each subinterval at the scale τ ). Then we get two data sets: a set containing both the normalized
velocity and magnetic ﬂuctuations for the low speed streams (each variable is made by 10890 samples), and a
diﬀerent set containing the same quantities for the high speed streams (each variable made of 13068 samples). We
calculate the PDF’s at 11 diﬀerent scales logarithmically spaced τ = ∆t 2n, where n = 0, 1, ..., 10 and ∆t = 81 s.
We collect the number of events within each bins by using 31 bins equally spaced in the range within 3 times the
standard deviation of the total sample. Before we mixed the diﬀerent subperiods belonging to a given class (high
or low speed streams), we tested for the fact that the gross features of PDF’s shape does not change in diﬀerent
subintervals. Then our results for high and low speed streams are representative of what happens at the PDF’s.

The results are shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2, where we report the PDF’s of both velocity and magnetic intensity
for the high speed streams (the same ﬁgures can be done for the slow speed streams). At large scales the PDF’s
are almost Gaussian, and the wings of the distributions grow up as the scale becomes smaller. This is true in all
cases, say for both types of wind. Stronger events at small scales have a probability of occurrence greater than
that they would have if they were distributed according to a gaussian function. This behavior is at the heart of the
phenomenon of intermittency as currently observed in ﬂuid ﬂows (Frisch, 1995) and in the solar wind turbulence
(Marsch and Tu, 1997). As a characteristic it is worthwile to note that for the magnetic intensity, the PDF’s wings
at small scales are more ”stretched” with respect to the corresponding PDF’s calculated for velocity. This is true
both in slow and fast wind.

Results and Discussion

In order to make a quantitative analysis of the energy cascade leading to the process described in the previous

section, we have tried to ﬁt the distributions by using the log–normal ansatz (Castaing et al., 1990).

λ(τ )√2π

exp

(cid:20)−

2

(σ/σ0)
2λ2(τ ) (cid:21)

d(ln σ)

even if also other functions gives rise to results not really diﬀerent. The parameter σ0 represents the most probable
value of σ, while λ(τ ) =< (∆ ln σ)2 >1/2 is the width of the log–normal distribution of σ.

We have ﬁtted the expression (1) on the experimental PDF’s for both velocity and magnetic intensity, and we
have obtained the corresponding values of the parameter λ. The values of the parameters σ0, which do not display
almost any variation with τ are reported in the Table. Our results are summarized in ﬁgures 1 and 2, where we
plot, as full lines, the curves relative to the ﬁt. As can be seen the scaling behavior of PDF’s in all cases is very well
described by the function (1), thus indicating the robustness of the cascade model. From the ﬁt, at each scale τ ,
we get a value for the parameter λ2(τ ), and in ﬁgures 3 we report the scaling behavior of λ2(τ ) for both high and
10−3 at the large scales (about 1 day), the parameter increases abruptly
low speed streams. Starting from λ2
10−1 at about 2 hours, and ﬁnally a scaling law starts to become evident up to ∆t = 81 sec. In this last
to λ2
range, which corresponds roughly to what is usually called the ”Alfv´enic range”, we ﬁtted the parameter with a
power law λ2(τ ) = µτ −β . The values of µ and β obtained in the ﬁtting procedure and the corresponding range of
scales, are reported in the Table.

Figure 2. The scaling behavior of the PDF for δbτ as calculated from the experimental data (white symbols) in
the fast streams. The full lines represent the ﬁt obtained through the model as described in the text.

Looking at Figure 3, it can be seen that both in fast and in slow streams magnetic ﬁeld intensity is more

5

intermittent than bulk speed (values of λ2 are at least two times larger for magnetic ﬁeld intensity than for
velocity). This has also been reported by Marsch and Tu (1994), and the same indications comes from 2D MHD
direct simulations (Politano et al., 1998), and in analysis of solar wind intermittency performed using diﬀerent
thecniques (Veltri and Mangeney, 1999). The values of λ2(τ ) are more or less the same for magnetic ﬁeld intensity
both in fast and in slow wind. This is perhaps related to the fact that magnetic ﬁeld intensity ﬂuctuations are
related to compressive ﬂuctuations, which should have the same nature in both types of wind. The bulk velocity
ﬂuctuations on the contrary are more intermittent at small scales (81 sec) in the fast wind and at large scale (
1
hour) in the slow wind. This result is due to the diﬀerent values of β for fast and slow wind. From the Table it
appears that the value of β is not universal, a result which has also been found in ﬂuid ﬂows (Castaing et al., 1990)
being close to β
0.2 for magnetic ﬁeld intensity in both fast and slow wind and for the velocity ﬁeld in slow wind,
while in fast wind the value of β for the bulk velocity ﬂuctuations is β

0.44.

Figure 3. We show the scaling behavior of λ2(τ ) vs. τ for both fast (black symbols) and slow (open symbols)
streams. Circles refer to the magnetic ﬁeld intensity, squares refer to the bulk velocity.

In the framework of the cascade model, Castaing et al. (1990) give an interpretation of the parameter β as the co–
dimension of the more intermittent structures in a 1D cut of the turbulent ﬁeld. If one believes to this interpretation,
our results show that singular structures which are responsible for intermittency of the bulk velocity, look diﬀerent
for both type of winds. In particular structures in fast wind appears to lie on set with higher co–dimension. The
fact that the value of β for the bulk velocity ﬂuctuations in slow wind is the same as the value of β for magnetic
ﬁeld intensity suggests that intermittent structures in slow wind are perhaps mainly associated with compressive
ﬂuctuations. On the contrary the diﬀerent value of β found in fast wind evidentiate a diﬀerent nature of velocity
ﬂuctuations in fast wind, perhaps related to the fact that such ﬂuctuations are mainly incompressible. This result
is in agreement with what has been recently found by Veltri and Mangeney (1999); these authors found that in
fast wind the more intermittent structures are tangential discontinuities with almost no variation in magnetic ﬁeld
intensity, while in slow wind the most intermittent structures are shock waves, which display the same behavior in
bulk velocity and magnetic ﬁeld intensity.

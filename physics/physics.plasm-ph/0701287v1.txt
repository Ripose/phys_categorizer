Abstract

We determine the growth rate of linear instabilities resulting from long-wavelength transverse per-
turbations applied to periodic nonlinear wave solutions to the Schamel-Korteweg-de Vries-Zakharov-
Kuznetsov (SKdVZK) equation which governs weakly nonlinear waves in a strongly magnetized cold-
ion plasma whose electron distribution is given by two Maxwellians at slightly diﬀerent temperatures.
To obtain the growth rate it is necessary to evaluate non-trivial integrals whose number is kept to
minimum by using recursion relations. It is shown that a key instance of one such relation cannot be
used for classes of solution whose minimum value is zero, and an additional integral must be evalu-
ated explicitly instead. The SKdVZK equation contains two nonlinear terms whose ratio b increases
as the electron distribution becomes increasingly ﬂat-topped. As b and hence the deviation from
electron isothermality increases, it is found that for cnoidal wave solutions that travel faster than
long-wavelength linear waves, there is a more pronounced variation of the growth rate with the angle
θ at which the perturbation is applied. Solutions whose minimum value is zero and travel slower than
long-wavelength linear waves are found, at ﬁrst order, to be stable to perpendicular perturbations
and have a relatively narrow range of θ for which the ﬁrst-order growth rate is not zero.

Introduction

In Part 1 (Allen et al. 2007) we considered solitary wave solutions of a modiﬁed version of the Zakharov-
Kuznetsov (ZK) equation which, in a frame moving at speed V above the speed of long-wavelength linear
waves, takes the form

ut + (u + bu1/2

V )ux +

2ux = 0

−

∇

(1.1)

where the subscripts denote derivatives. We referred to this equation as the Schamel-Korteweg-de Vries-
Zakharov-Kuznetsov (SKdVZK) equation as it contains both the quadratic nonlinearity of the KdV
equation and the half-order nonlinearity of the Schamel equation. The equation governs weakly non-
linear ion-acoustic waves in a plasma permeated by a strong uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the x-direction.
The plasma contains cold ions and two populations of hot electrons, one free and the other trapped by
the wave potential, whose eﬀective temperatures diﬀer slightly. In (1.1) u is proportional to the elec-
Tef /Tet)/√π where Tef and Tet are the eﬀective temperatures of the
trostatic potential, and b = (1
free and trapped electrons, respectively. As b increases, the electron distribution becomes less peaked.
A ﬂat-topped distribution is in accordance with numerical simulations and experimental observations of
collisionless plasmas (Schamel 1973). For further background to the physical basis and applicability of
the SKdVZK and related equations, reference should be made to Part 1.

The existence of planar solitary wave solutions to the SKdVZK equation and their stability to trans-
verse perturbations was addressed in Part 1. In this paper we turn to the study of planar cnoidal wave
solutions to the equation. In Sec. 2 we show that a number of families of cnoidal wave solutions to the
one-dimensional form of (1.1) exist, but not all can be expressed in closed form. Linear stability analysis
of periodic solutions of the SKdVZK equation with respect to transverse perturbations is carried out in

Sec. 3. Such an analysis has been carried out on cnoidal wave solutions of the ZK and SZK equations
which contain single quadratic and half-order nonlinearities, respectively (Infeld 1985; Munro and Parkes
1999). However, as far as we are aware, such a calculation has not been performed before on an equation
containing two nonlinear terms. The stability analysis leads to a nonlinear dispersion relation in the form
of a cubic equation whose coeﬃcients are ﬁnite-part integrals involving the unperturbed solution and its
derivative. As the solutions contain elliptic functions the integrals are non-trivial. Recursion relations
between the integrals are derived in order that only the simplest ﬁnite integrals need to be evaluated
directly. For some types of solution it is shown that one instance of a recursion relation cannot be used
and an extra integral must be found directly. In Sec. 4 we examine how the ﬁrst-order coeﬃcient of the
growth rate found from the nonlinear dispersion relation depends on the type of cnoidal wave, the angle
at which the perturbation is applied, and b. Our conclusions are presented in the ﬁnal section.

2 Cnoidal wave solutions

To look for planar cnoidal wave solutions of permanent form travelling at speed V above the long-
wavelength linear wave speed we drop the t, y and z dependence in (1.1). Integrating once then gives

where C0 and C are integration constants. Although from phase plane analysis it is clear that a number

general. Sketches of (2.2) for the various cases leading to periodic solutions when C0 = 0 are shown in

Possible forms of g(r) for various V , b and C are sketched in Fig. 2. The u1/2 term that appears in (1.1)
must be interpreted as the positive square root and as a result we must restrict solutions of (2.3) to r > 0.
In view of this, at ﬁrst sight it would appear that nonlinear wave solutions to (2.3) that cross the line
x = r2g(r), the r > 0 part of such a
r = 0 with positive r2
solution forms a complete closed loop that touches the origin in the (u>0, ux)-plane, as can be seen to
occur in Fig. 1(b) and (c), and hence corresponds to a nonlinear wave solution with a minimum value of
zero. Although for such solutions in the (r, rx)-plane rx jumps from a negative to an equal and opposite
positive value at r = 0, it is easily shown that u and its derivatives are continuous there. The jump in the
solution in the (r, rx)-plane means that the solutions are most simply expressed as functions extended by
periodicity. Such solutions have already categorized for the Schamel equation (which contains the single
half-order nonlinearity) in O’Keir and Parkes (1997). Schamel (1972) described them for the current
equation but in the following they are presented in a more uniﬁed form.

We now turn our attention to the solutions written as periodically extended functions. For V > 0
these occur when c > 0. As in these cases there are only two real roots, these solutions take a similar
form to (2.6). However, due to the jump in the (r, rx)-plane they must be written in the form

These solutions have a period of 2 ¯χ/¯η and for a given value of V and b have a larger amplitude than the
solitary wave. We call these type IIpe solutions. When b = 0 they reduce to an ordinary KdV equation
cnoidal wave solution with a minimum value of zero.

From Fig. 2(c) and (d) it is clear that when V < 0, smaller amplitude solutions that touch u = 0 are
also possible. When there are two real roots, (2.7) still applies, while if b > 0 and there are four real
roots, what we will refer to as the type Ipe solution results. It is similar to (2.5) but must be written as

3 Linear stability analysis

By using the small-k expansion method (Rowlands 1969; Infeld 1985; Infeld and Rowlands 2000), we
now investigate the linear stability of periodic waves to long-wavelength perturbations with wavevector
k(cos θ, sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ) where θ is the angle between the direction of the wavevector and the x-axis,
and ϕ is the azimuthal angle. We start from the ansatz

u = u0(x) + εΦ(x)eik(x cos θ+y sin θ cos ϕ+z sin θ sin ϕ)−iωt

(3.1)

where u0(x) is a periodic solution to (1.1), ε << 1, and the eigenfunction Φ(x) must have the same period
as u0(x). Substituting (3.1) into (1.1) and linearizing with respect to ε gives

For the remainder of the calculation we follow a similar procedure to that ﬁrst given in Parkes (1993).
After substituting (3.3) and (3.4) into (3.2) and equating coeﬃcients of kn we obtain the sequence of
equations

iωj. Since
in which the expressions for Rnx are of the same form as in Part 1 after replacing γj by
Lu0x = 0, the solution to LΦn = Rn + Bn, where Bn are integration constants obtained on integrating
(3.5), is

To lowest order in k we have (LΦ0)x = 0. As a result of the translational invariance of u0, this has a
solution proportional to u0x. This result can be obtained more explicitly, as is done in Munro and Parkes
= 0 to show that
= 0,
(1999), by using the consistency conditions
v0x = 0. Without loss of generality we choose a unit constant of proportionality (which corresponds to
setting v0 = 1) and we are left with

u0(LΦ1)xi

(LΦ1)xi

= 0, and

v0xi

Integrating the ﬁrst-order equation gives

Φ0 = u0x.

and after using (3.7) one obtains

To obtain ω1 it is not necessary to evaluate Φ2. Instead, we ﬁrst apply the ﬁnite-part averaging operation
, and by virtue of the

to (3.15). After using partial integration to show that
= 0), we get

Owing to the fact that u0x is zero at some points, the direct evaluation of the βs would require a
ﬁnite-part calculation. This can be avoided by instead expressing these quantities in terms of the αs. To
accomplish this, we require a number of recursion relations. The ﬁrst of these is obtained by multiplying
(2.1) by us

Using (3.24a), (3.26) and (3.27), all the βs for s = 0, . . . , 4 can then be expressed in terms of α1, α−1 and
α3/2.

We now turn to the evaluation of αs. A recursion relation involving only αs can be obtained by

However, if u0(x) is zero at some values of x, as is the case for the type Ipe and IIpe solutions, and s < 0,
the average of us

(3.28) has to be modiﬁed. Before continuing, it should be noted that, in contrast, (3.21) is always valid
which is identically zero.

From (3.28) it is evident that we will have to evaluate at least two of the αs directly. The simplest to
ﬁnd, due to the fact that the periodic wave solutions are of the form u0(x) = [r(x)]2, are α1/2 and α1. The
evaluation of these integrals for type I, IIpe, and Ipe solutions is given in the Appendix. To determine the

βs and
as the only coeﬃcient that is zero is multiplying a term originating from a ﬁnite integral. Thus we have

For type I solutions, the ﬁnal term on the right-hand side is zero. For the type Ipe and IIpe solutions,
the integral in (3.29) is inﬁnite and the ﬁnite part would have to be found numerically. In such cases
α3/2 needs to be obtained directly, as is done in the Appendix. The remaining αs can be found in a
straightforward manner by putting s = 0, 1

The values of αs corresponding to ﬁnite integrals obtained using the procedure outlined were checked
by numerical integration for speciﬁc values of the parameters. The numerical values of the remaining
quantities, namely, α−1 for the periodically extended solutions and the βs, for which the ﬁnite-part
operation is not redundant, were checked using a ﬁnite-part numerical integration technique (O’Keir
1993; Phibanchon 2006).

4 Growth rate of instabilities

Having obtained the three roots to the nonlinear dispersion relation (3.20), we discard the real parts as
they are of no importance in the context of stability. The solution is unstable if two of the roots are
complex conjugates. If ω1 is one of these roots, the ﬁrst-order growth rate of the instability is given by

γ

γ1k

Im ω1|

k.

≡ |

≡

When examining the dependence of the growth rate on the type of solution and the direction of the

perturbation we ﬁnd it convenient to introduce the parameter c, a rescaled version of C, deﬁned by

(4.1)

c

,

provided that V >
1 and the soliton limit
occurs at c = 0. The type Ipe and IIpe solutions have c > 0. As in Part 1, we only consider the stability
of solutions for which b > 0 as these are the more physically relevant.

−

−

We feel that a plot of γ1 against θ shows the angular dependence of the growth rate more clearly than
the more traditional approach of using a polar plot to depict the dependence of the real and imaginary
parts of ω at all angles. The value of γ1 for type I solution instabilities as a function of angle for a
number of values of c and b are shown in Fig. 3. For the soliton limit (when c = 0) the growth rate is
proportional to sin θ which is in agreement with the results of Part 1. For the cnoidal wave solutions
1 < c < 0), γ1 is only non-zero above a critical angle, θcrit, which increases with decreasing c. It
(when
is also evident that θmax, the angle at which the maximum growth rate occurs, diﬀers from 90◦ for cnoidal
waves. The variation of both θmax and θcrit with c is shown in Fig. 4(a). The growth rate is largest for
the soliton limit. From the plot of γ1m, the maximum value of γ1 (the value when θ = θmax), in Fig. 5(a),

given that the waveform period increases rapidly and becomes inﬁnite at the soliton limit, c = 0. Notice
that the results found for the soliton limit are in agreement with the analytical results given in Part 1 of
this study.

In Part 1 it was found that γ1 for solitary waves decreases with increasing b for a ﬁxed value of
η. As is apparent from equation (2.2) of Part 1, for ﬁxed η, the amplitude decreases as b increases.
However, if the amplitude is ﬁxed (by using the appropriate value of η in each case) then it is found
that γ1 increases with b. Cnoidal waves for diﬀerent values of b but with the same amplitude and values
of m will have diﬀerent periods. It therefore seems inappropriate to compare the growth rates in such
cases. Nevertheless, meaningful comparisons can be made on examining the entire growth rate curve as a
function of θ. As can be seen from Figs. 3 and 5(a), there is a more marked variation of the growth rate
with θ for angles above θmax as b increases, and the plots in Fig. 4(a) indicate that θmax deviates from
the perpendicular most of all when b is large. On the other hand, θcrit shows only a slight dependence
on b.

We now turn to the stability results for solutions in the form of functions extended by periodicity.
When V > 0 and c is increased above zero, one obtains type IIpe solutions. It can be seen from Fig. 6(a)-
(c) that the ﬁrst-order growth rates of these solutions are higher than that for the soliton limit at some
angles, but this range of angles decreases with increasing b. In addition to an increasing θcrit with c,
the ﬁrst-order growth rate for exactly perpendicular perturbations vanishes for large enough b and c.
Evidently the growth rate has a signiﬁcantly greater angular dependence than for the Type I solutions.

For the stability results we have examined so far, the ﬁrst-order growth rate is non-zero for angles
just below 90◦. In the case of type Ipe and IIpe solutions when V < 0 the results in Fig. 6(d) indicate
that there is a cut-oﬀ angle θc above which γ1 vanishes. Hence such waves are, to ﬁrst order, stable to
perpendicular perturbations. In addition, the instability occurs over a relatively small range of angles,
even for large values of c. For these types of solution, as is shown in Fig. 5(b), the growth rate increases
monotonically with c, in contrast to the behaviour near the type I to type IIpe transition. There is no
spike in the growth rate at c = 1, the type Ipe-IIpe transition, since there is no sudden change of period
around that point.

5 Conclusions

This article has dealt with the small-k stability with respect to transverse perturbations of cnoidal wave
solutions to the SKdVZK equation which governs strongly magnetized plasma with slightly non-isothermal
electrons. It was found that the growth rate of instabilities for ordinary cnoidal waves that travel faster
than long-wavelength linear waves has a stronger angular variation as the distribution of electrons becomes
increasingly ﬂatter than the isothermal Maxwellian. We also examined a class of solutions that do not
occur for equations without a square root term. These solutions, which are written as functions extended
by periodicity, have a minimum value of zero. This causes diﬃculties with some instances of recursion
relations used in the determination of the growth rate, and results in it being necessary to evaluate an
additional integral. This type of solution, for the case when the wave velocity is less than that of long-
wavelength linear waves, has, to ﬁrst order, a relatively narrow range of perturbation angles at which
instability occurs and is stable to perpendicular perturbations.

The half-integer nonlinear term in the SKdVZK equation was originally introduced by Schamel to
model the eﬀect of trapped particles in Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson
equation. Hence Part 1 and this paper are to be viewed as a step towards the more formidable problem
of studying the stability of the BGK modes where trapped particles play a signiﬁcant role.

A The evaluation of α1/2, α1 and α3/2
For cnoidal wave solutions, α1/2, α1, and α3/2 are elliptic integrals and for their evaluation we therefore
rely heavily on Byrd and Friedman (1954) to which the result numbers in the following refer.

Type I solutions

The type I solution as given by (2.5) has a period of 2K(m)/η where K(m) is the complete elliptic
integral of the ﬁrst kind. From result 340.01 we obtain

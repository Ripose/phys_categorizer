A systematic method is proposed for the determination of the statistical properties of a ﬁeld
consisting of a coherent structure interacting with turbulent linear waves. The explicit expression
of the generating functional of the correlations is obtained, performing the functional integration on
a neighbourhood in the function space around the soliton. The results show that the non-gaussian
ﬂuctuations observed in the plasma edge can be explained by the intermittent formation of nonlinear
coherent structures.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a recent work [1] it has been proposed a systematic analytical method for the investigation of the statistical
properties of a coherent structure interacting with turbulent ﬁeld. The method is here developed in detail and new
possible applications or developments arise.

The nonlinearity of the dynamical equations of ﬂuids and plasma is the determining factor in the behaviour of these
systems. The current manifestation is the generation, from almost all initial conditions, of turbulent states, with an
irregular aspect of ﬂuctuations implying a wide range of space and time scales. The ﬂuctuations seem to be random
and a statistical characterization of the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds is appropriate. However it is known both from theory and
experiment that the same ﬁelds can have, in particular situations, stable and regular forms which can be identiﬁed
as coherent structures, for example solitons and vortices. For most general conditions one should expect that these
aspects are both present and this requires to study the mixed state consisting of coherent structures and homogeneous
turbulence.

Numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamics show that in general cases a coherent structure emerges in a
turbulent plasma, it moves while deforming due to the interactions with the random ﬁelds around it and eventually
is destroyed. In plasma turbulence a coherent structure is build up by the inverse spectral cascade or by merging
and coalescence of small-scale structures [2], [3], [4]. The nonlinearity of the equations for the drift waves in a
non-uniform, magnetized plasma permits the formation of solitary waves in addition to the usual small-amplitude
dispersive modes. The convective nonlinearity (of the Poisson bracket type), can lead to low-frequency convective
structures in magnetized plasma [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The structures are not solitons in the strict sense but are very
robust. It is even possible that the state of plasma turbulence can be represented as a superposition of coherent vortex
structures (generated by a self-organization process) and weakly correlated turbulent ﬂuctuations.

Naturally, the coherent structures inﬂuences the statistical properties of the ﬁelds (the correlations), in particular
the spectrum. In this context it is usual to say that the deviation of the correlations of the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds from the
gaussian statistics is associated with the presence of the coherent structures and it is named intermittency. Numerical
simulations [10] of the 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes ﬂuid turbulence have shown coherent structures evolving from
random initial conditions and in general energy spectra steeper than k−3 have been atributed to intermittency (patchy,
spatial intermittent paterns). These coherent structures are long-lived and disappear only by coalescence, the latter
being manifested as spatial intermittency. In these studies it was underlined that the coherent structures have eﬀects
which cannot be predicted by closure methods applied to mode-coupling hyerarchies of equations.

The diﬃculty of the analytical description consists in the absence from theory of well established technical methods
to investigate the plasma turbulence in the presence of coherent structures. While for the instability-induced turbu-
lence (via nonlinear mode-coupling) systematic renormalization procedures have been developed, the problem of the
simultaneous presence of coherent structures and drift turbulence has not received a comparable detailed description.
In the recently proposed method [1], the starting point is the observation that the coherent structure and the drift
waves, although very diﬀerent in form, are similar from a particular point of view: the ﬁrst realizes the extremum
and the later is very close to the extremum of the action functional that describes the evolution of the plasma.
The analytical framework is developed such as to exploit this feature and is based on results from well established
theories: the functional statistical study of the properties of the classical stochastic dynamical systems (in the Martin-
Siggia-Rose approach); the perturbed Inverse Scattering Transform method, allowing to calculate the ﬁeld of perturbed
nonlinear coherent structures; the semi-classical approximation in the study of the quantum particle motion in multiple
minima potentials.

The dilute gas of plasma solitons has been studied by Meiss and Horton [13] who assumed a probability density
function of the amplitudes characteristic of the Gibbs ensemble. We analyse the same nonlinear equation but take
into account the drift wave turbulence.

A brief discussion on the closure methods developed in the study of drift wave turbulence provides us the argumen-
tation for the need of a diﬀerent approach (Section 2). The Section 3 contains a description of the general lines of
the method proposed. A more technical presentation of the calculation is given in the subsection 3.2. The particular
case of the drift wave equation is developed in detail in the Section 4 and in the Section 5 the explicit expression of
the generating functional is used for the calculation of the correlation functions. The results and the conclusions are
presented in the last Section. Some details of calculations are given in the Appendix.

II. THE NONLINEAR DYNAMICAL EQUATIONS

We consider the plasma conﬁned in a strong magnetic ﬁeld and the drift wave electric potential in the transversal
plane (x, y) where y corresponds to the poloidal direction and x to the radial one in a tokamak. We shall work with
the radially symmetric Flierl-Petviashvili soliton equation [27] studied in Ref. [13] :

or u < 0. The function is represented in Fig.1. In the Ref.
where the velocity is restricted to the intervals u > vd
[13] the radial extension of the solution is estimated as: (∆x)2 ∼ ρsLn. In our work we shall assume that u is very
close to vd , u >

∼ vd (i.e. the solitons have small amplitudes).

The nonlinear equations for the drift waves are known to generate as solutions irregular turbulent ﬁelds but also
exact coherent structures of the type (2), depending on the initial conditions. Typical statistical quantities are the
correlations, like: hϕ (x, y, t) ϕ (x′, y′, t′)i ∼ |x − x′|ζ |t − t′|z , where for the homogeneous turbulence the exponents
ζ and z are calculated by the theory of renormalization or by spectral balance equations, using closure methods (
[20]). Various closure methods have been developed as perturbations around gaussianity and they are valid for small
deviation from the gaussian statistics [17]. We see intuitively that this approach cannot be extended to the description
of the coherent structures. This can also be seen in more analytical terms. A quantity which is unavoidable in the
calculation of the correlations is the average of the exponential of a functional of the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld, consider simply
hexp (ϕ)i (for example in the inverse of the Vlasov operator, using the Fourier transformation, the potential appears
in the formal expression of the trajectory, i.e. at the exponent). This quantity can be written schematically as [17]:

(1)

where hhϕnii represents the cumulant of order n (i.e. the irreducible part of the correlation, after substracting the
combinations of the lower order cumulants). For a gaussian statistics the ﬁrst two cumulants are diﬀerent of zero
(n = 1 : average and n = 2 : dispersion), all others are zero. Non-vanishing of the higher order cumulants is the
signature of non-gaussian statistics. In the perturbative renormalization we assume slight deviation from gaussianity,
i.e. small absolute values of the next order cumulants (e.g. the kurtosis must be close to 3, the gaussian value) and
vanishing of the higher order cumulants. This assumption is obviously invalid in the case of coherent structures. The
ﬁeld of a coherent structure has long range, persistent correlations imposed by its regular geometry, which naturally
requires non-vanishing very large order cumulants (i.e. many terms in the sum at the exponent in Eq.(3)) and excludes
any perturbative expansion.

In particular, the closure of the nonlinear equation for the two-point correlation (based on the retaining the directly
interacting triplet) can account for the small scale correlations related to the space-dependent relative diﬀusion, i.e.
the clump eﬀect ( [18], [19], [20]), but the spectrum obtained in this framework cannot account for the possible
existence of the coherent structures. This clearly suggests that we must ﬁnd a diﬀerent approach.

III. COHERENT STRUCTURES IN A TURBULENT BACKGROUND

A. The outline of the method

We present the basic lines of an approach which can provide a statistical description of the coherent structure in
a turbulent background. The physical origin of this approach is the observation that the non-linear equation whose
solution is the coherent structure (the vortex soliton) also has classical drift waves as solutions, in the case of very
weak nonlinearity. In a certain sense (which will become more clear further on), the vortex soliton and the drift waves
belong to the same family of dynamical conﬁgurations of the plasma. Our approach, which is designed to put in
evidence and to exploit this property, consists of the following steps.

We start by constructing the action functional of the system. The dynamical equation is the Euler-Lagrange

equation derived from the condition of extremum of this functional and the exact solution is the vortex soliton (2).

By using the exponential of the action we construct the generating functional of the irreducible correlations of ϕ.
This functional contains all the information on the coherent structure and the drift turbulence. The correlations
are obtained via functional diﬀerentiations. This requires the formal introduction of a perturbation of the system,
through the interaction with an external current. Throughout the work, this perturbation will be considered a small
quantity and ﬁnally it will be taken zero.

The generating functional is by deﬁnition a functional integral over all possible conﬁgurations of the system and
this integral must be calculated explicitely. The simplest thing to do is to determine the conﬁguration of the system
(with space and time dependence) which extremises the action, by equating the ﬁrst functional variation of the action
with zero and solving this equation: this will give the vortex soliton (modiﬁed due to the small interaction term).
Then one should replace this solution in the expression of the action. This is the lowest approximation and it does
not contain anything related to the drift wave trubulence.

At this point we can beneﬁt of the particular physics of the drift waves. The vortex soliton is the exact solution of
the fully nonlinear equation and is a localized potential perturbation with regular, cylindrical symmetric form. The
linear drift waves are harmonic potential perturbations propagating with constant velocity (the diamagnetic velocity
in the case of the drift poloidal propagation in tokamak). Although the drift waves have very diﬀerent geometry they
are solutions of the same equation as the vortex, but for negligible magnitude of the nonlinear term. The drift waves
do not exactly realize the extremum of the action functional, but obtain an action very close to this extremum. This
means that the drift waves and the vortex soliton are close in the function space in the sense of the measure deﬁned
by the exponential of the action. In other terms the drift waves are in a functional neighbourhood of the vortex (for
this measure). This suggests to perform the functional integral with better approximation, which means to perform
the integration over a functional neighbourhood of the vortex solution. This will automatically include the drift waves
in the generating functional of correlation which so will contain information on both the coherent structure and the
drift waves. The function space neighbourhood over which the functional integration is extended is limited by the
measure (exponential of the action) which severly penalizes all conﬁgurations of the system which are far from the
solution realizing the extremum (i.e. the vortex soliton). As in any stationary phase method there are oscillations
which strongly suppress the contribution of the conﬁgurations which are far (in the sense of the measure) from the
soliton. In practice we shall expand the action in a functional Taylor series around the soliton solution and keep the
term with the second functional derivative.

In this perspective the drift waves appear as ﬂuctuations around the soliton solution. This is compatible with the
numerical simulations which show that the vortices are accompagned by a tail of drift waves. During the interaction
of the vortices linear drift waves are “radiated” [21]. On the other hand, the analytical treatment of the perturbed
vortex solution by the perturbed Inverse Scattering Transform shows similar tail of perturbed ﬁeld, following the
soliton. This strengthens our argument that integrating close to the vortex means to include the drift waves in the
generating functional.

The functional integral can be performed exactly and we determine the generating functional of the potential
correlations. We shall calculate the two-point correlation by performing double functional derivative at the external
current.

B. Expansion around a soliton

1. The action and the generating functional of the correlations

The analytical framework is similar to the model of quantum ﬂuctuations around the instanton solution in the
semi-classical calculation of the transition amplitude for the particle in a two-well potential (see reference [32]). Let

3

us write formally the equation for a nonlinear plasma waves as

Oϕ = 0

b

O is the nonlinear
where the ﬁeld ϕ (x, y, t) represents the “ﬁeld” (coherent structure + drift waves) and the operator
operator of the equation (1). This equation should be derived from the condition of extremum of an action functional
which must reﬂect the statistical nature of our problem. The ﬁeld ϕ obeys a purely deterministic equation, but the
randomness of the initial conditions generates a statistical ensemble of realizations of the system evolutions (space-
time conﬁgurations). We shall follow the Martin-Siggia-Rose method of constructing the action functional but in
the path-integral formalism, for which we give in the following a very short description ( [22], [23], [34]). First, we
consider a formal extension from the statistical ensemble of realizations of the system’s space-time conﬁgurations to
a larger space of functions which may include even non-physical conﬁgurations. Every function is discretized in space
and time, so it will be represented as a collection of varables ϕi , each attached to the corresponding space-time point
i. In this space of functions, the selection of the conﬁgurations which correspond to the physical ones (solutions of
the equation of motion) is performed through the identiﬁcation with Dirac delta-functions, in every space-time point

and integration over all possible functions ϕ, i.e. over the ensemble of independent variables ϕi. Using the Fourier
representation for every δ function we get

Going to the continuum limit, a new function appears, χ (x, y, t) which is similar to the Fourier conjugate of ϕ. The

The random initial conditions ϕ0 (y) can be included by a Dirac δ functional: δ (ϕ (t0, y) − ϕ0 (y)). As explained in
[1], instead of this exact treatment (accessible only numerically) we exploit the particularity of our approach, i.e. the
connection between the functional integration and the delimitation of the statistical ensemble: the way we perform
the functional integration is an implicit choice of the statistical ensemble. We choose to build implicitely the statistical
ensemble, collecting all conﬁgurations which have the same type of deformations (given in our formulas by
χJ ). All
these conﬁgurations belong to the neighbourhood of the extremum in function space and we take them into account,
by performing the integration over this space. In doing so we assume that the ensemble of perturbed conﬁgurations
induced by an “external” excitation (J below) of the system is the same as the statistical ensemble of the system’s
conﬁgurations evolving from random initial conditions.

e

We must add to the expression in the integrand at the exponential a linear combination related to the interaction

of the ﬁelds ϕ and χ with external currents Jϕ and Jχ:

2. Schema of calculation of the generating functional

In the absence of the current J the equations (10) have as solutions for ϕ the nonlinear solitons (vortices) [30], [31].
More generally, the basic solution of the KdV equation (on which the Flierl-Petviashvili equation can be mapped) is
the periodic cnoidal function which becomes, when the modulus of the elliptic function is close to 1, the soliton. When
the distance between the centres of the solitons is much larger than their spatial extension (dilute gas) the general
solution can be written as a superposition of individual solitons, with diﬀerent velocities and diﬀerent positions [13].
For simplicity we shall consider in this work a single vortex soliton and in the last Section we shall comment on the
extension of the method to many solitons.

The position of the centre of the soliton rises the diﬃcult problem of the zero modes [32]. Except for a brief comment
about the relation of the zero modes with the gaussian functional integration (see below), we shall avoid this problem
and postpone the discussion of this topic to a future work.

In the presence of the external current J, the equations resulting from the extremization of the action SJ become
inhomogeneous, and the solutions are perturbed solitons. This point is technically non-trivial and we shall use the
results obtained by Karpman [29] who considered the Inverse Scattering Transform method applied to the perturbed
soliton equation. We ﬁnd the approximate solution ϕJs and χJs of the inhomogeneous equations (i.e. including the
external current J). The result depends on the currents J, and this will permit us to perform functional diﬀerentiations
in order to calculate the correlation, as shown in Eq.(9). As a ﬁrst step in obtaining the explicit form of ZJ , the
perturbed soliton solutions depending on J must be introduced in the expression of the action SJ . After that we
perform the expansion of the functions ϕ and χ around the coherent solution,

Since the action is invariant to the arbitrary position of the centre of the soliton there are directions in the function
space where the ﬂuctuations are not bounded and in particular are not Gaussian. This requires the introduction
of a set of collective coordinates and after a change of variables the functional integrations along those particular
directions are replaced by usual integrations over the colective variables, with inclusion of Jacobian factors. The
zero eigenvalues of the determinant (corresponding to the zero modes) are excluded in this way. We shall avoid this
complicated problem and assume a given position for the centre of the vortex.

is also adimensional.

We have to calculate explicitely the scalar function χ. Based on the extended knowledge developed in ﬁeld theory it
seems reasonable to assume that this function represents the generalization of the functions which have the opposite
evolution compared to ϕ: if ϕ evolves toward inﬁnite time, then χ comes from inﬁnite time toward the initial time.
If ϕ diﬀuses then χ anti-diﬀuses (see Ref. [33]). The general characteristics of this behaviour suggest to represent
χ as the object with the opposite topology than ϕ.
If ϕ has a certain topological class, then χ has the opposite
topological class. If ϕ is an instanton then χ is an anti-instanton. In our case: if ϕ is the vortex solution, then χ must
the “anti-vortex” solution, with everywhere opposite vorticity compared to ϕ. In our case of a single vortex, χ must
simply be a negative vortex.

In general terms, the direct (i.e. the vortex + random drift waves) solution ϕ arises from an initial perturbation
which evolving in time breaks into several distinct vortices (solitons) and a tail of drift waves, as shown by the Inverse
Scattering Method. The functionally conjugated (“regressive”) function χ is at t = ∞ a collection of vortices and
drift wave turbulence which evolving backward in time, toward t = 0, coalesce and build up into a single perturbation,
the same as the initial condition of ϕ. We can restrict our analysis to the time range where the two functions has
similar patterns (but opposite) which simply means to chose the time interval far from the initial and asymptotic
limits. As shown by analytical and numerical studies, the vortices (positive and negative) are robust patterns and the
time evolution simply consists of translations without decay. In conclusion we can take for the time range far from
the boundaries t = 0 and t = T :

To see this more clearly, we write down the action and then the Euler-Lagrange equations, with the current J

included.

When performing integrations by parts the boundary conditions of the two functions prevents us from taking the
integrals of exact diﬀerentials as vanishing, but this just produces terms which do not contribute to the determination
of the solution of extremum. We shall ﬁrst change the Eq.(19) such as to obtain by functional extremization an

is indeed the solution of the homogeneous equation (22) i.e. the negative vortex is the solution for χ.

We must remember that the “external” currents are arbitrary and later, after functional diﬀerentation, they will
be taken zero. This allows us to start from the conﬁgurations given by the homogeneous equations and Eq.(27) and
study the small changes using perturbative methods developed in the framework of the Inverse Scattering Transform.
We will only use the current Jϕ which will be denoted J and already take Jχ = 0.

B. The condition of extremum of the action functional

The Euler - Lagrange equations for the two functions χ and ϕ are obtained from the ﬁrst functional derivative of
the action SJ : δSJ /δχ = 0 and δSJ /δϕ = 0. The ﬁrst equation (which is the original equation) has the solution
(2). It does not depend on the current J (since the corresponding current Jχ has been taken zero). However, for
uniformity of notation we shall write ϕJs

The second Euler-Lagrange equation is the equation for χ, with the inhomogeneous term given by the current J:

ϕJs(x, y, t) ≡ ϕs (x, y, t)

where − ϕs (x, y, t) represents the “free” solution of the variational equation, i.e. the negative vortex (anti-soliton)

χJ (x, y, t) is the small modiﬁcation induced by an inhomogeneous small term, J (x, y, t). Since the function
χJ (x, y, t) is the perturbation of the negative-vortex solution we will use the equation (26) but with the opposite
current (i.e. −J instead of J), as (30) requires.

Now we shall expand the action SJ [ϕ] to second order around the saddle-point solution. Write

where the function (δϕ, δχ) is a small diﬀerence from the extremum solution.The expanded form of the action will be
written:

ϕ = ϕJs + δϕ

this will imply boundary terms, but these are now zero since the variations δϕ and δχ vanishes at the limits of the

The functions δϕ (y, t) and δχ (y, t) represent the diﬀerences between the solutions at extremum (solitons) and other
functions which are in a neighbourhood (in the function space) of the solitons. According to the discussion above,
the functions which are “close” to the solitons, for the Flierl-Petviashvilli equation are drift waves. For this reason

with k⊥ representing an average normalized wavenumber for the pure drift turbulence. However, the operator will be
retained when applied on the functions related to solitons, since these solutions owe their existence to the balance of
nonlinearity and dispersion.The following detailed expressions are obtained for the operators involved in this equation:

The square brakets are used to underline that the diﬀerential operators are not acting outside and the only operation
is multiplication. We use the equation veriﬁed by ϕJs to make the following replacement

The equation becomes

We now take into account the propagating nature of the drift waves and make the change of variables t → t
and y → y − vdt i.e. we change to the system of reference moving with the diamagnetic velocity. We simplify the

∂
equation assuming that the most important space-time variation is wave-like and replace ∂
∂y . By this change
of variables the soliton will not be at rest in the new reference system, but it will move very slowly since we have
assumed that u >
∼ vd. We make another approximation by neglecting the slow motion of the soliton. This restricts us
to the wavenumber spectrum but considerably simpliﬁes the calculations. The space variable which will be denoted
again y measures the space from the ﬁxed center of the soliton, in the moving system. The diﬀerence between the KdV
soliton, which is one-dimensional and depends exclusively on y and the vortex which is a two-dimensional structure
will be considered in the simplest form as described by the estimation of Meiss and Horton for the x - extension of
the vortex. For convenience we suppress the index n and replace ψϕ

∂t = −vd

n by q.

We have a suggestive conﬁrmation that the generating function ZJ (via the action SJ ) potentially contains con-
ﬁgurations of the system consisting of simple drift waves. A perturbation consisting of drift waves and propagating
with the diamagnetic velocity vd is an approximate solution of the original equation for small amplitude (i.e. small
nonlinearity). Due to its particular structure, the Martin-Siggia-Rose action functional is exactly zero when calculated
with the exact solution, in the absence of any external current J. The action expanded to the second order then gives,
for no vortex (ϕJs = 0, χJs = 0)

which implies periodic oscillations in the space variable y with (recall that everything is adimensional)

U (λ; y) ≡ λ2 t1 + λ t2 + t3

h (±yh) = 0.

The functions ti (y) are represented for i = 1, 2 in Figure 2 and 3. The function

has singularities at the points where h vanishes. We introduce the notation yh for the location of the singularities,
taking into account the symmetry around y = 0, the centre of the soliton

Since the soliton is very localized, the function U has very fast variations close to the singularities. The slow variation
of the function U (λ; y) over most of the space interval (−L/2, +L/2) becomes very fast due to the growth of the
absolute values of t1, t2 and t3 near ±yh, on spatial intervals having an extension of the order of the spatial unit,
i.e. ρs in physical terms. Since the physical model leading to our original equation cannot accurately describe the
physical processes at such scales, we shall adopt the simplest approximation of U , assuming that it reaches inﬁnite
absolute value at points which are located whithin a distance of ρs of the actual positions of the singularities, ±yh. We
have checked that the exact position of the assumed inﬁnite value of U has no signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnal results,
which can be explained by observing that t1,2,3 will be integrated on. The total space interval is now divided into
three domains: (−L/2, −yh) (external left), (−yh, yh) (internal) and (yh, L/2) (external right). Here “internal” and
“external” refer to the region approximatly occupied by the soliton. The form of the function U imposes the function
w to vanish at the limits of these domains. In a more general perspective, the fact that w behaves independently on
each domain has a consequence with statistical mechanics interpretation: the generating functional (similar to any
partition function) is obtained by integrating over the full space of the system’s physical conﬁgurations and behaves
In particular the functional
multiplicatively for any splitting of the whole function space into disjoint subspaces.
integration over the space of functions δϕ and δχ actually consists of three functional integrations over the disjoint
function subspaces corresponding to the three spatial domains. The fact that our physical model is restricted to
spatial scales larger than ρs necessarly has an impact on the maximum number of eigenvalues λn that should be
retained in the inﬁnite product giving the determinant, but we shall not need to use this limitation.

For absolute values of the parameter λ greater than unity (which will be conﬁrmed a posteriori, by the expressions
(62) and (71) below), the three terms in the expression of U have very diﬀerent contributions. The terms t3 is
practically negligible, and the term with t1 is always much greater than t2 in absolute value. In the following we
consider separately the three domains.

On the “external left” domain, the function t1 is positive. If we ﬁx at zero the amplitude and the phase of w at the

limit −L/2 the condition that the solution vanishes at −yh gives, for λ real,

In the integrand, the ﬁrst term is factorized and, taking into account the relative magnitude of the terms, we expand

On the “external” regions the functions t1, t2 are not symmetrical around the centre y = 0 since the perturbed
soliton develops a “tail” which is not symmetrical. However we take this perturbation to be small and assume the
same absolute value for the function β1 on both external domains.

We remark that we remain with two quantities in which all the functional depencence on the current J is packed:

and drop the factor const; actually the latter depends on α1 and αc and thus on the current J and contributes to the
functional derivatives. However, taking a formal limit N to the number of factors in (81) we ﬁnd that the functional
derivatives of α1 and αc give additive terms which vanish in the limit N → ∞. Then we drop const since it disappears

The ﬁrst term reproduces the self-correlation of the soliton and represents the connection with the results of Ref.
[13], with our particular simpliﬁcations: single soliton and ﬁxed (non-random) position of its centre. As can easily
be seen, the ﬁrst order functional derivatives of SJ to the current J reduce to the function ϕs calculated in the
corresponding points. The term with the double functional derivative of the action represents the contribution to the
self-correlation of the soliton due to a statistical ensemble of initial conditions, without drift waves. All mixed terms
(i.e. containing both the action and one of the factors A or B) represent interaction between the perturbed soliton
and the drift waves. The terms containing exclusively the factors A and/or B refers to the drift waves in the presence
of the perturbed soliton.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The formulas obtained by functional diﬀerentiation of the generating functional are complicated and a numerical
calculation is necessary. We chose a particular value of the soliton velocity (which also ﬁxes its amplitude): u = 1.725 vd
and let the variables y1 and y2 sample the one-dimensional volume of length L = 0.2 m. The physical parameters are
chosen such that ρs ≈ 10−3m and vd ≈ 571 m/s. We recall that there are two particular symmetry limitations of our
calculation. (1) The soliton centre is assumed ﬁxed (at y = 0) , especially for avoiding the complicated problem of
the zero modes. (2) Due to the asymmetry of the perturbed soliton tail the terms which results from the functional
diﬀerentiation are also asymmetric. These are only limitations of our calculation and in no way reﬂect the reality of a
isotropic motion of many solitons in a real turbulent plasma. In order to see to what extent our result can be useful

14

for understatnding the (much more complicated) real situation we will symmetrize these terms in the unique mode
which is accessible to our one-dimensional calculation, i.e. take into account the mixing of perturbed solitons moving
in the two directions on the line.

The amplitude of the modiﬁcations of the soliton depends on a parameter which is the average time of interaction
with the perturbation. This average time is comparable with the time required to cross L at a speed of vd and is
limited since the growth of the perturbation cannot exceed the soliton itself.

The ﬁgures are conventional representations of functions of two variables (y1, y2); they do not correspond to a
two-dimensional geometry. For this reason it is not expected to have circular symmetry. The contributions to the
correlation from the last two factors in Eq.(86) have amplitudes similar or less by a factor of few units, compared to
the pure soliton. The factors coming from “internal” part are peaked and localized on the soliton extension while the
“external” part gives terms oscillating on (y1, y2). In wavenumber space, there are contributions to both low-k and
high-k regions. The spectrum of an unperturbed soliton is smooth and monotonously decreasing from the peak value
at k = 0. Fig.5 shows much more structure. In the low-k part there are many local peaks, an eﬀective manifestation
of the periodic character of the terms (as shown by (72) ). This arises from the discrete nature of the eigenvalues,
which is induced by the second order diﬀerential operator and the vanishing of the eigenmodes at the positions of the
α, which makes
singularities ≈ ±yh. The singularities are generated by the vanishing of the norm of the operator
ambiguous the assumption of propagating wave character, ∂t = −vd∂y. The large-k part mainly reﬂects the structure
of the small-scale shape perturbation of the soliton, comming from β-related terms. Fig.6 is an (k, ω) spectrum
obtained from ω − ku = 0 and repeating the calculations for various soliton velocities umax > u > vd. Although we
cannot aﬀord high umax since the expressions of t1,2,3 (y) depend on the assumption u >
∼ vd , we remark local peaks
in contrast to the “pure soliton” result of Ref. [13].

b

For simplicity we have assumed a single soliton. However the calculation can be readily extended to the multi-
soliton case, considering instead of (29) and (31) sums over many individual soliton solutions with diﬀerent velocities
β
and positions of the centres. These sums replace the functions ϕJs and χJs in the expressions of the operators
γ. If the velocities are all greater but not too diﬀerent of vd the change of variables to the referential moving
and
with vd (described in the paragraph below Eq.(45) ) will leave a very slow time variation which eventually may be
b
treated perturbatively. Many solitons will also generate many singularities arising from the vanishing of the function
h, and this will factorize the space of functions and correspondingly the generating functional. It will become however
possible to consider random positions and random velocities and average them with distribution functions for the
Gibbs ensemble, like in [13]. This is very simple with the ﬁrst term of (86), which should be compared directly with
Ref. [13], but technically very diﬃcult with the terms involving functional derivatives of A and/or B.

The ﬁrst results suggests that the non-gaussianity at the plasma edge can be explained by the presence of coherent
structures. The contribution of avalanches to the deviation from the gaussian statistics cannot be excluded but, as
shown for self-organized systems [36], they have a scaling which should be easy recognized, at least in frequency
domain.

In conclusion we have developed an approach which allows us to calculate the statistical properties of a coherent
structure in a turbulent background. Compared to the standard renormalization, this approach is at the opposite limit
in what concerns the relation “coherent structure / wave turbulence”, highlightning the coherent structure. However
it oﬀers comparatively greater possibilities for the extension of this studies to the more realistic problem of cascading
wave turbulence mixed with rising and decaying coherent structures.

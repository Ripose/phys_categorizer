Abstract

The problem of radio wave reﬂection from an optically thick plane
monotonous layer of magnetized plasma is considered at present work.
The plasma electron density irregularities are described by spatial
spectrum of an arbitrary form. The small-angle scattering approx-
imation in the invariant ray coordinates is suggested for analytical
investigation of the radiation transfer equation. The approximated
solution describing spatial-and-angular distribution of radiation re-
ﬂected from a plasma layer has been obtained. The obtained solution
has been investigated numerically for the case of the ionospheric ra-
dio wave propagation. Two eﬀects are the consequence of multiple
scattering: change of the reﬂected signal intensity and anomalous re-
fraction.

1 Introduction

Basic goal of the present work consists in derivation and analysis of the
transfer equation solution describing spatial-and-angular distribution of radio
radiation reﬂected from a plane stratiﬁed layer of magnetized plasma with
random irregularities.

The radiation transfer equation (RTE) in a randomly irregular magne-
tized plasma was obtained in the work [1] under rather general initial assump-
tions. In particular, the medium average properties were assumed smoothly
In the work [2] the radiation energy
varying both in space and in time.
balance (REB) equation describing radiation transfer in a plane stratiﬁed
layer of stationary plasma with random irregularities has been deduced. The
invariant ray coordinates, allowing one to take into account, by a natural
way, refraction of waves and to represent the equation in the most simple
form, were used there.
In the work [3] it was shown that the REB equa-
tion is a particular case of the radiation transfer equation obtained in [1]
and can be deduced from the latter by means of transition to the invariant
ray coordinates. REB equation, thus, allows one to investigate inﬂuence of
multiple scattering in a plane stratiﬁed plasma layer on the characteristics of
radiation. In particular, it enables one to determine the spatial-and-angular
distribution of radiation leaving the layer if the source directivity diagram
and irregularity spatial spectrum are known. A few eﬀects which require
of wave amplitudes coherent summation for their description (for example,
phenomenon of enhanced backscattering) are excluded from consideration.
However, the multiple scattering eﬀects are much stronger, as a rule. This is
true, in particular, for the ionospheric radio propagation.

The numerical methods of the transfer equation solving developed in the
theory of neutron transfer and in the atmospheric optics appear useless for
the REB equation analysis. They are adapted, basically, to the solution of
one-dimensional problems with isotropic scattering and plane incident wave.
In a case of magnetized plasma the presence of regular refraction, aspect-
sensitive character of scattering on anisometric irregularities and high di-
mension of the problem (the REB equation contains two angular and two
spatial coordinates as independent variables) complicate construction of the
eﬀective numerical algorithm for its solving. In this situation it is expedient
to solve the REB equation in two stages. The ﬁrst stage consists of obtain-
ing of the approximated analytical solution allowing one to carry out the

3

qualitative analysis of its properties and to reveal of its peculiarities. At
the second stage the numerical estimation methods can be applied to the
obtained analytical solution. This approach has been realized at our work.

We begin the present paper from a detailed exposition of the invariant
ray coordinates concept. Then possibility to use of the small-angle scattering
in the invariant coordinates approximation is discussed. Two modiﬁcations
of the REB equation solution are obtained. The analysis of the obtained
solutions (both analitical and numerical) concludes the paper.

2 Invariant ray coordinates and the radiation

energy balance equation

It is convenient to display graphically the electromagnetic wave propagation
in a plane-stratiﬁed plasma layer with the aid of the Poeverlein construction
[4, 5]. We shall brieﬂy describe it. Let the Cartesian system of coordinates
has axis z perpendicular and the plane x0y parallel to the plasma layer. We
shall name such coordinate system “vertical”. It is assumed that the vector
~H is situated in the plane z0y . Module
of the external magnetic ﬁeld
of radius-vector of any point inside of the unit sphere with centrum in the
coordinate origin corresponds to the value of refractive index ni(v, α), where
i = 1 relates to the extraordinary wave, i = relates to the ordinary one,
v = ω2
is the plasma frequency, ω2 is the frequency of a wave, α is
the angle between radius-vector and magnetic ﬁeld ~H . The refractive index
v and to all possible directions of
surface corresponding to a ﬁxed value of
the radius-vector represents a rotation body about an axis parallel to vector
~H (see ﬁg. 1).

e /ω2 , ω2
e

Convenience of the described construction (in fact, this is an example
of coordinate system in space of wave vectors ~k) is become evident when
drawing the wave trajectory: it is represented by a straight line, parallel to
the axis z. This is a consequence of the generalized Snell law, which also
requires of equality of the fall angle and exit angle onto/from a layer (θ), and
constantness of the wave vector azimuth angle (ϕ). Note, that the crossing
point of a wave trajectory with the refractive index surface under given value
of v determines current direction of the wave vector in a layer (it is anti-
parallel to a radius-vector) and current direction of the group speed vector

4

(it coincides with the normal to the refractive index surface). The projection
of a wave trajectory onto the plane x0y is a point which radius-vector has
module sin θ and its angle with relation to axis x equals to ϕ. Thus, the
coordinates θ and ϕ deﬁne completely the whole ray trajectory shape in a
plane layer and outside of it and are, in this sense, invariant on this trajectory.
Radiation of an arbitrary point source of electromagnetic waves within
ϕ + dϕ corresponds to the energy ﬂow in the
the solid angle θ
~k-space inside of a cylindrical ray tube parallel to axis z with cross section
sin θd(sin θ)dϕ = sin θ cos θdθdϕ. In case of regular (without random irregu-
larities) plasma layer this energy ﬂow is conserved and completely determined
by the source directivity diagram:

θ + dθ; ϕ

÷

÷

P (z, ~ρ, θ, ϕ) = P0(~ρ, θ, ϕ)

(1)

where P is energy ﬂow density in the direction determined by angles θ, ϕ
through the point ~ρ on some base plane situated outside of the layer parallel
to it (in the ionosphere case it is convenient to choose the Earth’ surface as
the base plane), z is distance from the base plane (height in the ionosphere
case). We shall assume in the present paper that function z(v) is monotonous
in the region of wave propagation and reﬂection. If random irregularities are
absent and source of radiation is point, variable ~ρ in (1) is superﬂuous,
as the matter of fact, since unequivocal relation between it and angles of
arrival of a ray θ, ϕ exists. When scattering is present the radiation energy
redistributes over angular variables θ, ϕ and in space what is described by
variable ~ρ. The value of P satisﬁes in this case to the equation of radiation
energy balance [2, 3]:

wave with wave vector coordinates α, β in magnetic coordinate system (cor-
responding invariant coordinates are θ′ and ϕ′) which arises at interaction of
the wave with wave vector coordinates α0, β0 (invariant coordinates θ and ϕ
) with irregularities. Vector function ~Φ(z; θ′, ϕ′; θ, ϕ) represents the displace-
ment of the point of arrival onto the base plane of a ray which has angular
coordinates θ′ and ϕ′ after scattering at level z with relation to the point of
arrival of an incident ray with angular coordinates θ, ϕ . It is essential that
in a plane-stratiﬁed medium the function ~Φ is determined only by smoothed
layer structure v(z) and does not depend on the scattering point horizontal
coordinate and also on coordinate ~ρ of the incident and scattered rays. Note
also that ratio ~Φ(z; θ, ϕ; θ′, ϕ′) =

~Φ(z; θ′, ϕ′; θ, ϕ) takes place.

It is possible to check up that equation (2) satisﬁes to the energy con-
servation law: when integrating over all possible for level z values of θ, ϕ
and all ~ρ its right side turns into zero. It is natural since in absence of true
absorption the energy inside the plasma layer does not collected.

Analyzing expression for the scattering diﬀerential cross section in a
magnetized plasma (see, for example, [6]), it is easy to be convinced that the
following symmetry ratio takes place:

Q(z; θ, ϕ; θ′, ϕ′) sin θ cos θ is symmetric with relation
tity
to rearrangement of shaded and not shaded variables. The equation REB in
the form (4) has the most compact and perfect appearance. It is clear from
physical reasons that (4) has to have a unique solution for given initial distri-
bution P0(~ρ, θ, ϕ). The obtained equation can be directly used for numerical
calculation of the signal strength spatial distribution in presence of scatter-
ing. However, as it was noted at introduction already, this approach leads to
essential diﬃculties. Subsequent sections describe the method of construction
of the energy balance equation approximated analytical solution.

We shall assume now that the most probable distinction of angles ω′ and ω
is small. The heuristic basis for this assumption is given by analysis of the
Poeverlein construction (ﬁg. 1). It is easy to be convinced examining the
Poeverlein construction that scattering near the reﬂection level even for large
angles in the wave vector space entails small changes of the invariant angles
θ, ϕ. This is especially true for irregularities strongly stretched along the
magnetic ﬁeld (in this case the edges of scattered waves wave vectors form
circles shown in ﬁg. 1 as patterns A and B). One should note also that the
changes of invariant angles θ, ϕ are certainly small if scattering with small
change of a wave vector direction takes place. This situation is typical for
irregularity spectra, in which irregularities with scales more than sounding
wave length dominate. Thus, the small-angle scattering approximation in the
invariant coordinates has wider applicability area than common small-angle
scattering approximation.

P at the initial equation (4) would be incorrect since function P may not
to have property of continuity. For example, in case of a point source, P0
is a combination of δ-functions. As it will be shown later, the function
X is expressed through P0 by means of repeated integration and, hence,
diﬀerentiability condition fulﬁls much easier for it.

layer of plasma with scattering through the spatial-and-angular distribution
of the incident radiation, that is, in essence, through the source directivity
diagram.

4 Alternative approach in solving the REB

equation

The REB equation solving method stated in the previous section is based on
∼
P (z, ~ρ, ω)
representation of quantity P (z, ~ρ, ω) as a sum of the singular part

10

and the regular one X(z0, ~ρ, ω). Regularity of the X(z0, ~ρ, ω) has allowed
one to use the expansion into the Taylor series over variables ~ρ and ω at the
equation (10) right side and to transform the integral-diﬀerential equation
(10) into the ﬁrst order partial derivative diﬀerential equation (11).

However, the stated approach is not the only possible. The REB equation
can be transformed right away using Fourier-representation of the function
P (z, ~ρ, ω):

P (z, ~ρ, ω) =

d2qP (z, ~q, ω) exp(i~q~ρ)

5 Analysis of the solution of the REB equa-

tion

We shall show, ﬁrst of all, that the obtained solution satisﬁes to the energy
conservation law. For this purpose it is necessary to carry out integration
of the left and right sides of (15) over ω and ~ρ multiplied them previously
by sin θ cos θ. The area of integration over angles is deﬁned by the condition
that both wave ω and wave ω′ achieve the same level z (since at level
z their mutual scattering occurs). To satisfy this condition one should add
z] to the integrand expression, where
factors Θ [hr(ω)
Θ(x) is the Heviside step function, hr(ω)
is the maximum height which can
be reached by a ray with parameters θ, ϕ. Now integration can be expanded
π/2 for θ and over
over all possible values of angles, i.e., over interval 0
2π for ϕ. Then, (15) becomes

solution in the form (21).

Results of the present section give the weighty ground to believe that
the radiation spatial-and-angular distribution is determined basically by the
ﬁrst term in the solution (9). The second term represents the amendment to

13

the solution which can be neglected in the invariant coordinate small-angle
scattering approximation. This statement validity can be checked under
detailed research of properties of the obtained REB equation approximated
solutions by numerical methods.

6 Technique of numerical calculation of mul-

tiple scattering eﬀects

We shall proceed from the obtained solution (15) where only the ﬁrst term
has been retained.
In the considered approximation the multiple scatter-
ing results in deformation of the radiation ﬁeld reﬂected by a plasma layer
without change of a kind of function describing intensity spatial and angular
distribution. If only single ray with parameters θ0 (~ρ), ϕ0 (~ρ) comes into each
point ~ρ onto the base plane when reﬂecting from a regular plasma layer (it
will be so, if the source is dot-like and the frequency is less than critical one
for this layer), for function P0 it is possible to use expression of a kind

According to (26), an observer being at point ~ρ discovers two eﬀects
connected with scattering in a plasma layer: change of the wave arrival angles
and change of the received signal intensity. The analytical results of the
present work are valid in a common case of magnetized plasma. However, we
shall consider below the case of an isotropic plasma linear layer, as it displays
the task basic features at relative simplicity of numerical calculations. The
simpliﬁcation is mainly due to possibility to deﬁne the ray trajectories in
the analytical form. For a numerical estimation of the eﬀects described by
the main term of the REB equation solution it is necessary, ﬁrst of all, to
concretize the kind of the ∆N/N irregularity spectrum. We shall choose the
spectrum of the following kind:

is a normalization constant, Γ (x) is the Gamma-function, Kβ (z) is the Mac-
donald function [7]. The δR quantity characterizes the level of irregulari-
ties ∆N/N. In mathematical theory of random ﬁelds it corresponds to the
structural function of the irregularity ﬁeld for the scale length R [8]. The

15

considered model of a power-like small-scale irregularity spectrum is used
in many areas of modern physics. Both at the ionospheric F region and at
the tokamak plasma the irregularities are strongly stretched along the mag-
netic ﬁeld. We preserve this feature of irregularities even when dealing with
isotropic plasma model. Let the plasma layer with a linear dependence of
electron density on depth (dz/dv = H) be located at distance h0 from the
radiation source. The scattering cross-section for isotropic plasma is [8]:

7 Calculation results for isotropic plasma

·

The calculations were carried out for the following set of parameters: h0 = 150
10−3 (ionospheric
km, H = 100 km, ν = 2.5, l0⊥ = 10 km, R = 1 km, δR = 3
irregularity level characteristic of night quiet conditions), frequency f = 5
MHz, the angle of irregularity inclination (”magnetic ﬁeld” inclination) γ =
25o. Thus we mean the conditions of the ionosphere sounding from the
Earth surface. The intensity attenuation and change of the arrival angles of
a signal reﬂected from a layer (with relation to those values when reﬂecting
from the same plasma layer without irregularities) were calculated for area
which sizes were 800 km along the y axis (the magnetic meridian direction)
and 400 km along the x axis. The radiation source was in the coordinate
origin. The calculation results are represented in ﬁgures 2 - 4. On the
contour map of ﬁg. 2 the constant level lines of the received signal intensity
attenuation (in dB) are shown. The signal attenuation calculated value is
symmetric with relation to both the y axis (i.e. magnetic meridian plane) and
the x axis with accuracy determined by numerical calculation errors. The
result is not trivial: there is asymmetry in the problem conditions due to the
irregularity inclination. The central symmetry is required by the reciprocity
theorem [4, 5]. Thus the obtained numerical solution is in accordance with
the electromagnetic ﬁeld general properties. This is an additional argument
to the beneﬁt of the conclusion about the primary signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst
term in the REB equation approximate solution (15).

The main detail in ﬁg. 2 is the region having the shape of ellipse with
half-axes of 300 km and 60 km where signiﬁcant intensity attenuation (up to
15 dB) takes place. Outside of this region some increase of the signal intensity
(in comparison with its value in absence of irregularities) is observed. This
is quite natural result because at an nonabsorbing medium the complete
radiation energy ﬂow is conserved and scattering results only in its spatial
redistribution. At larger distance from the source the intensity change aspires
to zero. The transition from the region of the reﬂected signal attenuation
to the region of ampliﬁcation is of sharp character. That is, probably, a
consequence of approximation used under transformation of the expression
(14) to the expression (15) ﬁst term. One can expect that retaining of the
higher order terms in the series expansion will result in smoothing of the
above transition.

The second of multiple scattering eﬀects (i.e. change of the arrival angles)

18

is illustrated if ﬁgs. 3 and 4. In ﬁg. 3 the contour lines show the absolute
value of the polar arrival angle θ alteration. In ﬁg. 3 the alteration of azimuth
angle is presented. One can see that distortion of the polar angle reaches of
5 and maximum alteration of the azimuth angle is 90o.

Both eﬀects are observed in experiment. The intensity reduction of the
vertical sounding signal reﬂected from the ionosphere should be interpreted
by the observer as an additional collisionless mechanism of radio wave atten-
uation. This phenomenon is observed under natural conditions bringing the
increased values of the eﬀective collision frequency [10, 11]. There are the
weighty grounds to believe that it is connected to development of small-scale
irregularities in the ionosphere. In particular, it is displayed stronger at night
time and can reach of 10-15 dB [11]. The latter ﬁgure is in accordance with
our calculation results. The experimental data on the arrival angle change
of a wave on a short line (when transmitter to receiver distance is about 100
km) are reported in [12].

8 Conclusion

In the present work the heuristic basis for use of the invariant coordinate
small-angle scattering approximation under solving of the RTE for a magne-
tized plasma layer is considered. Within the framework of this approximation
two versions of the analytical solution have been obtained. They describe
spatial-and-angular distribution of radiation reﬂected from a monotonous
plasma layer with small-scale irregularities.

The physical conclusions about inﬂuence of the multiple scattering eﬀects
in a layer of plasma on the spatial-and-angular characteristics of radiation are
possible on the basis of detailed numerical research of the obtained solutions.
Such research has been carried out in the present work for the case of isotropic
plasma.

It was shown that the main term of the REB equation solution for the
radiation reﬂected from a plasma layer with random irregularities describes
two eﬀects: the signal intensity change (attenuation for the normal sounding)
and the arrival angle change. Both eﬀects are observed in the experiments on
the ionosphere radio sounding. The ﬁrst one is known as anomalous attenu-
ation of radio waves at natural conditions. Note, that under the ionosphere
heating experiments another kind of anomalous attenuation is observed: its

19

mechanism is based on the mode transformation under scattering, not on the
multiple scattering [13]. The eﬀect of arrival angle change can be interpreted
as a mechanism of additional refraction in the ionosphere and also has exper-
imental conﬁrmation. These two eﬀects numerical estimations obtained in
the present work for parameters of a plasma layer and irregularity spectrum
typical for mid-latitude ionosphere are in accordance with experimental data.
The considered eﬀects can be observed not only at the ionosphere radio
sounding but also at sounding by electromagnetic radiation of other kinds of
plasma with random irregularities both in natural and in laboratory condi-
tions.

Abstract

In this paper we report on our theoretical studies of various aspects of the
correlated stopping power of two point-like ions (a dicluster) moving in close
but variable vicinity of each other in some metallic target materials the lat-
ter being modelled by a degenerate electron gas with appropriate densities.
Within the linear response theory we have made a comprehensive investiga-
tion of correlated stopping power, vicinage function and related quantities for
a diproton cluster in two metallic targets, aluminum and copper, and present
detailed and comparative results for three approximations to the electron gas
dielectric function, namely the plasmon-pole approximation without and with
dispersion as well as with the random phase approximation. The results are
also compared, wherever applicable, with those for an individual projectile.

1 INTRODUCTION

The stopping of energetic charged particles in a target material is a prob-
lem of long-standing theoretical and experimental interest. Early pioneering
theoretical work by Bohr who had a lifelong interest in this problem was fol-
lowed by Bethe and others. There is by now an extensive literature on this
topic. We refer the reader to two recent review articles [1, 2]. The problem in
its generality is rather complex. However simpliﬁed theoretical models have
been applied with considerable success in explaining experimental data. As-
suming a weak coupling between the energetic particle and a target material,
specially a metal which is usually approximated by a degenerate electron gas,
a detailed theoretical model has emerged through the works of Bohm, Pines,
Lindhard, Ritchie and other authors [3-5].

A comprehensive treatment of the quantities related to inelastic particle-
solid and particle-plasma interactions, e.g. scattering rates and diﬀerential
and total mean free paths and energy losses, can be formulated in terms of
the dielectric response function obtained from the electron gas model. The
results have important applications in astrophysics [6, 7] and radiation and
solid-state physics [8-11], and more recently, in studies of energy deposition
by ion beams in plasma fusion targets [12-16].

One can think of several situations in which the projectile beam ions
may be closely spaced so that their stopping is inﬂuenced by their mutual
interactions [14, 15] and thus diﬀers from the stopping of charged particles
whose dynamics is independent of each other. This can happen, for example,
in the case of very high density beams, or more realistically, when cluster
ions are to be used instead of standard ion beams [16].

The stopping of uncorrelated or independent charged particles in a de-
generate electron gas (DEG) has been extensively studied in the literature
(see, for example, [3-9, 13] and other references therein). These studies have
been done mostly within the linear response formalism and for the projectile
velocity V comparable or greater than vF , the electron Fermi velocity.

The objective of this paper is to make a study of the stopping power
(SP) of correlated charged particles in a DEG. The simplest and yet phys-
ically relevant case is the SP of an ion pair (a dicluster). We report on a
comprehensive investigation, which is mostly numerical, of various aspects
of a dicluster stopping in a DEG. Previous theoretical works have consid-
ered this problem within the linear response theory [9-11] and in a simple

2

plasmon-pole approximation. In our study, again in the linear response for-
malism, we have used both the plasmon-pole approximation (PPA) as well
as the full Lindhard expression for the random phase approximation (RPA)
in the DEG dielectric function. As in earlier studies we consider a dipro-
ton cluster as a projectile and compare our theoretical results with those of
Basbas and Ritchie [10] who used PPA and with those obtained in RPA.
Whenever applicable, the results are also compared with those for an inde-
pendent projectile (e.g. those due to Yakolev and Kotel’nikov [7]). No RPA
results for a diproton cluster SP and related aspects have previously been
reported in the literature.

2 STOPPING POWER

Let us consider an external charge with distribution ρext(r, t) = Qext(r −
Vt) moving with velocity V in a medium characterized by the longitudinal
dielectric function ε(k, ω). Within the linear response theory and in the Born
approximation the scalar electric potential ϕ(r, t) due to this external charge
screened by the medium is given by [1]

ϕ(r, t) = 4πZ dkQext(k)

exp [ik(r − Vt)]

k2ε(k, kV)

,

(1)

where Qext(k) is the Fourier transform of function Qext(r).

The stopping power which is the energy loss of the external charge re-
garded as a projectile, per unit path length in the medium regarded as a
target material, can be calculated from the force acting on the charge. The
latter is related to the induced electric ﬁeld Eind in the medium. For a three-
dimensional medium we have, for the SP,

Eind(r, t) =

Eq. (2) is applicable to any external charge distribution. We shall apply
it to a cluster of two point-like ions having charges Z1e and Z2e separated
by a variable distance R. For this dicluster

Then the stopping power of a dicluster may be written as

where Sind(V ) and Scorr(R, V ) stand for individual and correlated SP, respec-
tively. From Eqs. (2) and (3)

J0(x) is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and zero order and ϑ is the angle
between the interionic separation vector R and the velocity vector V. Eqs.
(5) and (6) can also be obtained from the linearized Vlasov-Poisson equations
for a two-ion projectile system, as has been done by Avanzo et al. [14]. In
their study the target material is a dense classical electron gas.

We note that there are two contributions to the SP of a two-ion cluster.
The ﬁrst one, given by the ﬁrst term in Eq. (4), is the uncorrelated particle
contribution and represents the energy loss of the individual projectiles due
to their coupling with the target electron gas. The second contribution, the
second term in Eq. (4), arises due to a correlated motion of the two ions
through a resonant interaction with the excitations of the electron gas. Both
terms are responsible for an irreversible energy transfer from the two-ion
projectile system to the target electron gas.

In many experimental situations, clusters are formed with random orien-
tations of R. A correlated stopping power appropriate to this situation may
be obtained by carrying out a spherical average over R of the Scorr(R, V ) in
Eq. (4). We ﬁnd

One may consider an interference or vicinage function, which is a measure
of the separation of single-particle contribution from its correlated counter-
part, to the stopping power. This function is deﬁned as [10, 14, 15]

Γ(R, V ) =

Scorr(R, V )

Eq. (4) can then be put in the form

Γ(R, V ) describes the strength of correlation eﬀects with respect to an un-
correlated situation. The vicinage function becomes equal to unity as R → 0
when the two ions coalesce into a single entity, and goes to zero as R → ∞
when the two ions are totally uncorrelated.

3 THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS OF SP

The key ingredient in the calculation of stopping power, as outlined in Sec-
tion II, is the linear response function ε(k, ω) of the target material. The
latter is modelled in most cases by a dense electron gas neutralized by a
positive background - the so-called jellium model. The eﬀect of lattice is not
included except perhaps through an eﬀective mass of the electrons. This is a
reasonable model for target materials like Cu and Al. ε(k, ω) for a dense, and
hence a degenerate electron gas, has been calculated in various approxima-
tions in the literature. Two of them are: (A) Plasmon-Pole approximation
(PPA), and (B) the full random phase approximation (RPA). Actually the
plasmon-pole approximation is a simpliﬁcation of the RPA response function.
We shall consider SP in these two approximations.

3.1 SP in PPA without plasmon dispersion

Here we consider the simplest model of the dielectric function of a jellium. In
Ref. [10] (see also the Ref. [15]) a plasmon-pole approximation to ε(k, ω) for

5

an electron gas was used for calculation of dicluster SP. In order to get easily
obtainable analytical results, Basbas and Ritchie [10] employ a simpliﬁed
form which exhibits collective and single-particle eﬀects

where H(x) is the Heaviside unit-step function, ωp is the plasma energy of
the electron gas and the choice kc = (2mωp/)1/2 allows the two δ functions
in Eq. (10) to coincide at k = kc in the k-ω plane.

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (10) describes the response due to nondispersive
plasmon excitation in the region k < kc, while the second term describes
free-electron recoil in the range k > kc (single-particle excitations). This
approximate function satisﬁes the sum rule

Fermi wave number of the target electrons and Σ0 = 2.18 GeV/cm. In our
calculations χ (or rs) serves as a measure of electron density. The result in
Eq.(12) agrees exactly with the Bethe SP formula, except that the plasmon
energy of the electron gas ωp appears instead of the usual mean atomic
excitation energy. Eq. (12) represents the contribution of valence/conduction
electrons in a solid to the stopping of an ion.

Using Eq. (10) in Eq. (6), in the high-velocity limit V > Vp (or λ2 >

One sees a characteristic oscillatory behavior for large interionic distance
R. As discussed in [16], ﬂuctuations in the stopping power of a medium for
a cluster as separation increases are due to electron density variation in the
wake of the leading ion. The wavelength of these ﬂuctuations is ∼ 2πV /ωp
for high-velocity projectiles.

3.2 SP in PPA with plasmon dispersion

Plasmons without dispersion are an idealization. In real systems plasmons
are expected to undergo a dispersion leading to a ω(k). The actual dispersion
( in RPA) can be obtained from the linear response function (see Sec. 3.3).

Here we shall utilize a dispersion which is valid for small and intermediate
values of the wave vector k. Consequently we write

In order to evaluate the integrals by z in Eqs. (30)-(32) at λ < 1 (in

at λ > 1 (in high-velocity limit) we need to take into account the region
1 6 u 6 λ, 0 6 z 6 u − 1, where f2 may vanish. The integration in this
region includes the excitation of collective plasma modes (plasmons) by fast
charged particles. Consequently, although f2 = 0 the integrals in this region
are not equal to zero. A calculation of the collective part of SP is facilitated
if we use the following known expression

where zr(χ, u) is the solution of the dispersion equation ε(k, ω) = 0 in vari-
ables z and u.

Figure 19 shows the solution zr(χ, u) for various values of χ (solid line,
χ = 0.5; dashed line, χ = 0.15; dotted line, χ = 0.05). It may be noted
that the integration domain 0 6 u 6 λ, z > u + 1, where f2 = 0, does not
contain the dispersion curve zr(χ, u) calculated for metallic densities χ ∼ 0.5
(rs ∼ 2). Consequently the SP in this region of variables z and u vanishes
and there is no plasmon excitation.
Let us consider the low-velocity limit (V ≪ vF ) of Eqs. (30) and (31).
In this limit one can obtain simpler expressions for SP. From Eqs. (30) and
(31) we have

From Eqs. (36) and (37) it follows that Φ1(ξ) → 2/3, Φ2(ξ) → 0 at ξ → 0
and consequently, as expected, Scorr(λ, R, ϑ) → Sind(λ) when R → 0. Note
that (as is well-known [4, 13]) in the low-velocity limit the SP is proportional
to the velocity of particle (Eqs. (34) and (35)). Thus the vicinage function
Γ(λ, R, ϑ) at λ ≪ 1 depends only on interionic distance R and orientation
angle ϑ.

4 NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUS-

SION

Using the theoretical results of Secs. 2 and 3, we have made extensive nu-
merical calculations of stopping power (SP) and related quantities. In this
section we present detailed numerical results for two target materials, Al
and Cu. These two targets have been chosen because of their frequent use
in experiments and also because of their diﬀerent electron densities. In our
calculations χ (or rs) is a measure of electron density.

As a simple but generic example of a projectile, we have considered
a diproton cluster for which we present theoretical results for the follow-
ing quantities of physical interest: stopping power (SP/2), vicinage func-
tion (VF), angle-averaged stopping power (ASP/2), angle-averaged vicinage
function (AVF) together with the dependence of SP/2 and VF on R, the
inter-ionic separation distance within the cluster. The reason why SP has
been divided by a factor of 2 is that the SP results for a diproton cluster
are expected to reduce asymptotically (as R tends to inﬁnity) to those for
two uncorrelated protons, the latter being referred to as ISP. ASP has been
treated in the same way.

In our calculations of these quantities we have employed the linear re-
sponse approach which assumes a swift ion-cluster projectile and also that
the ion cluster presents a weak perturbation on the target plasma. The va-
lidity of the linear response approach to study ion-cluster stopping has been

11

discussed in detail by Zwicknagel and Deutsch [17]. We refer the reader to
their insightful discussion.

We model the Al and Cu targets by a dense (degenerate) electron gas neu-
tralized by a positive background (the jellium model) with electron densities
appropriate for the respective targets. The linear response of the target elec-
tron gas, which couples the cluster projectile to the target, is considered at
three levels of approximations to the dielectric function ε(k, ω) as discussed in
sections 2 and 3. In the context of stopping power these approximations are
subject to the following general remarks: The plasmon-pole approximation
(PPA) is valid only in the high velocity regime when the mean velocity V of
the cluster is > vF , the Fermi velocity of the target electrons. For V < vF
and for velocities near the threshold of collective mode excitations, this ap-
proximation is not adequate. The RPA overcomes this limitation although it
cannot account for short-range correlations in the electron gas. Within PPA
itself, PPA-1 (without plasmon dispersion) is more limited than PPA-2 (with
plasmon dispersion). The ﬁgures we present serve as a comparative study
of how these levels of approximation aﬀect the various physical quantities
related to stopping power.

Figs. 1-4 show cluster stopping power (CSP and its dependence on var-
ious quantities of experimental interest). Let us ﬁrst note that these ﬁgures
are presented for two speciﬁc values, 0 and π/2, of the angle ϑ. Correlations
between the two ions in the dicluster are maximum and minimum, respec-
tively, for these two values of ϑ. The objective is then to see how, for these
maximum and minimum conﬁgurations, CSP depends on R and V /vF . Fig.
1 shows CSP for Al target with R = 10−8cm, as a function of V /vF for the
two above-mentioned values of ϑ, within PPA. The lines without circles cor-
respond to PPA-1 and, with circles, to PPA-2. The angular dependence of
CSP is particularly noteworthy. It is seen that in a medium velocity range
(V < 2vF ), CSP has a remarkably higher value for the larger value of ϑ. This
is likely due to single-particle excitations in this velocity range. In the higher
velocity range, the dicluster wake-ﬁeld excitations become important and we
ﬁnd that the situation is reverse in the higher velocity range (V > 2vF ) for
which CSP for ϑ = 0 is larger than for ϑ = π/2.

In the low velocity range the diﬀerence between PPA-1 and PPA-2 (for
both ϑ = 0 and π/2) is noticeable while in the high velocity range this diﬀer-
ence becomes negligible. This is again due to single-particle excitations in the
low velocity range. For comparison, we have also presented the uncorrelated

12

stopping power (ISP).

When we increase the inter-ionic separation distance R from 10−8cm to
5 × 10−8cm, keeping other physical parameters the same, some interesting
changes occur, as can be seen from Fig. 2. A noticeable change is that
now, for V < 2vF , CSP for ϑ = 0 is higher than that for ϑ = π/2. This
sensitivity of CSP to the angle ϑ as R is varied may be due a combination of
factors. The dicluster behaves like a compact project for small R, and like
an extended projectile for large R. This has a bearing on Scorr given in Eqs.
(13) and (22). Correlation eﬀects are expected to be maximum when the
two ions are aligned with each other in the direction of propagation of the
dicluster projectile motion (ϑ = 0) while they decay (at least for V > vF )
when ϑ tends to π/2, the latter behavior being related to the wake-ﬁeld due
to the leading ion. The oscillation amplitude in Scorr tends to decrease from
ϑ = 0 to ϑ = π/2 (the ˇCherenkov cone). However when R is small each
ion is inﬂuenced by the unscreened ﬁeld of the other ion. For model solid
targets, the ˇCherenkov cone semivertex is ϑC = arcsin(√0.6vF /V ) [18]. ϑC
approximately equal to 22.80, 7.40, and 0.080 for V = 2vF , V = 6vF , and
V = 10vF , respectively. Consequently in the high velocity range the trailing
ion moves inside the ˇCherenkov cone of the leading ion only for almost aligned
diclusters. The behavior of CSP shown in Figs. 1 and 2 reﬂects these features
within the linear response and for PPA. It will be noted that the high values
of SP are due to the PPA-1 approximation. PPA-2 decreases these values
to a small extent. Later, when we use a more realistic, namely RPA, for
the linear response function (Figs. 20 and 21) SP considerably decreases in
strength.

Figs. 3 and 4 show SP for Cu, another commonly used metallic target.
These ﬁgures show patterns similar to those in Figs. 1 and 2, except that
CSP and ISP have lower values over the entire range of V /vF . This is because
Al has a higher electron density than Cu.

The vicinage function (VF) given by Eq. (8) has been plotted as a func-
tion of the beam velocity for Al target in Figs. 5 and 6. This function shows
an interplay between ϑ and R more strikingly than CSP. Figs. 7 and 8 display
a similar behavior for Cu target.

As stated in Sec. 2, an average stopping power (ASP) is of experimental
interest. Figs. 9 and 10 show ASP for Al and Cu, respectively. ISP is also
shown, for comparison. The role of PPA-1 and PPA-2 is now more clearly
seen.

13

In the same spirit we have plotted AVF for Al and Cu in Figs. 11 and
12. The role of R is highlighted in these ﬁgures. However it will be noticed
that PPA-1 and PPA-2 make practically no distinction for AVF.

We have so far plotted SP or ASP (divided by a factor of 2 in both the
cases) vs the beam velocity V /vF , for some values of the separation distance
R. We now look for some complementary information about SP, and plot SP
as a function of R with V = 3vF , for Al target. Fig. 13 shows an oscillatory
character of SP with respect to R. The oscillations are the highest for ϑ = 0
and lowest for ϑ = π/2. The role of PPA-1 and PPA-2 is clearly seen for
ϑ = 0. Fig. 14 shows a similar behavior of SP for Cu although the amplitudes
are now weaker.

In the same way the vicinage function (VF) is plotted in Figs. 15 and 16,

for Al and Cu targets, respectively.

Fig. 17 shows ASP vs R for both Al and Cu targets. The diﬀerence
between PPA-1 and PPA-2 is negligible and the Cu target has ASP smaller
than for Al. Now, there is something interesting about Fig.18 which shows
AVF. The diﬀerence between PPA-1 and PPA-2 is again negligible. But
let us note that data for both Al and Cu lie practically on the same curve!
Recalling the deﬁnition of VF, Eq. (8) one can see from Eqs. (12), (16), (21)
and (26) that AVF has a weak dependence on target density. Also, when
λ = V /vF > 2, Sind does not noticeably depend on PPA-1 and PPA-2. These
features combine to lead to the behavior of AVF as seen in Fig. 18.

We have so far presented results for PPA-1 and PPA-2. A more realis-
tic linear response function, namely the exact random phase approximation
(RPA) will now be used for the metallic target. The theoretical results for
SP etc. have been presented in Sec. 3.3. As part of calculating SP in RPA
it is useful to examine the plasmon dispersion obtained through ε(zr, u) = 0,
where z and u have been deﬁned in Sec. 3.3. Fig. 19 displays zr(χ, u) vs u
for three electron density parameter values.

Next we present ISP and CSP in RPA, for Al and Cu in Figs. 20 and
21, corresponding to R = 10−8cm and R = 5× 10−8cm, respectively. For the
sake of a better presentation of the data we have also separately displayed
the Al data in Figs. 20a and 21a. The RPA results show that SP and ISP
decrease in strength with an improved linear response function. This should
be of relevance to experiments.

Next, VF in RPA vs V /vF is presented in Fig. 22, for Al (lines without
circles) and for Cu (lines with circles), corresponding to R = 10−8cm and

14

for ϑ = 0 and π/2. This ﬁgure may be compared with Figs. 5 and 7. For
V /vF < 2, the curves for VF in RPA tend toward ﬁnite values whereas the
VF-curves in PPA do not although the angular trend is similar. A similar
contrast may be noted between Figs. 6 and 8, and Fig. 23, corresponding to
R = 5 × 10−8cm. Again, these ﬁndings are of experimental relevance.
Averaged SP vs. V /vF in RPA is presented in Fig. 24, for Al (curves
without circles) and for Cu (curves with circles) along with ISP, correspond-
ing to R = 10−8cm and 5× 10−8cm. This ﬁgure may be compared with Figs.
9 and 10. Fig. 24 shows an expected overall decrease in the strength of ASP
in RPA.

There are similarities but also some interesting diﬀerences if we compare
Figs. 11 and 12 with Fig. 25. The latter shows AVF in RPA for Al (curves
without circles) and for Cu (curves with circles). The diﬀerences are more
noteworthy for R = 10−8cm.

SP vs R in RPA is plotted in Fig. 26, corresponding to V = 3vF , for Al
and Cu in the previously stated scheme. When Fig. 26 is compared with
Figs. 13 and 14, the diﬀerences between PPA and RPA become particularly
striking.

A similar contrast is provided by a comparison of Fig. 27 with Figs. 15
and 16, for VF vs. R in RPA and PPA, corresponding to V = 3vF and for
ϑ = 0 and π/2. For comparison AVF is also plotted in Fig.27.

This completes our extensive presentation of ﬁgures exhibiting various
aspects of the stopping power of a diproton cluster in PPA and RPA, for Al
and Cu targets.

5 SUMMARY

In this paper we have presented a comprehensive theoretical study of stopping
power (SP) of a dicluster of protons in a metallic target. After a general
introduction to SP of a cluster of two point-like ions, in Sec. 2, theoretical
calculations of SP based on the linear response theory and using PPA without
and with plasmon dispersion and then with RPA are discussed in Sec. 3. The
theoretical expressions for a number of physical quantities derived in section
lead to a detailed presentation, in Sec. 4, of a large collection of data through
ﬁgures on correlated stopping power (CSP), vicinage function (VF), average
stopping power (ASP) and average vicinage function (AVF) of a diproton

15

cluster projectile for two metallic targets, Al and Cu. Whenever relevant,
we have also provided a plot of independent (i.e. single-ion) stopping power
(ISP) for comparison.

With the proviso stated in Sec. 4, SP and related quantities have been
studied within a linear response formalism; some analytical and all numerical
results have been obtained corresponding to three approximations to the di-
electric function of the target electron gas-the plasmon-pole approximation
(PPA) without dispersion (PPA-1) and with dispersion (PPA-2), and also
with the random phase approximation (RPA). To our knowledge this is the
most comprehensive calculation of the SP-related physical quantities using
all the three dominant approximations to the linear response function. The
results we have presented demonstrate that with regard to several physical
quantities of primary interest the diﬀerence between PPA and RPA is sub-
stantial while for others, specially for average quantities, this diﬀerence may
not be of practical signiﬁcance.

It will be of interest to go beyond RPA in order to include some short-
range correlations in the electron gas and to study how dicluster SP is af-
fected. However calculating the linear response function by including electron
energy bands is rather involved and detailed theoretical studies of SP with
band structure eﬀects included have not yet been reported in the literature.
One can include some aspect of band structure in a rather approximate man-
ner through an eﬀective mass for the electrons.

Another aspect we have not considered in this paper is some eﬀect of
disorder in the target medium. In real metals electrons suﬀer collisions with
impurities etc. We intend to address this issue in the context of stopping
power in a separate study.

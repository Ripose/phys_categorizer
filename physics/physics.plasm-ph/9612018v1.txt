The inﬂuence of various kinetic eﬀects (e.g. Landau damping, diﬀusive and collisional dissipation, and
ﬁnite Larmor radius terms) on the nonlinear evolution of ﬁnite amplitude Alfv´enic wave trains in a ﬁnite-β
environment is systematically investigated using a novel, kinetic nonlinear Schr¨odinger (KNLS) equation.
The dynamics of Alfv´en waves is sensitive to the sense of polarization as well as the angle of propagation
with respect to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. Numerical solution for the case with Landau damping reveals
the formation of dissipative structures, which are quasi-stationary, S-polarized directional (and rotational)
discontinuities which self-organize from parallel propagating, linearly polarized waves. Parallel propagating
circularly polarized packets evolve to a few circularly polarized Alfv´en harmonics on large scales. Stationary
arc-polarized rotational discontinuities form from obliquely propagating waves. Collisional dissipation, even
if weak, introduces enhanced wave damping when β is very close to unity. Cyclotron motion eﬀects on
resonant particle interactions introduce cyclotron resonance into the nonlinear Alfv´en wave dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION

The envelope dynamics of nonlinear Alfv´en waves at
small-β are thought to be governed by the derivative
nonlinear Schr¨odinger (DNLS) equation, which describes
parametric coupling with acoustic modes [1].
It is be-
lieved that the dynamics of such waves changes drasti-
cally in a collisionless, ﬁnite-β plasma, due to several
kinetic eﬀects, especially collisionless (Landau) damp-
ing of ion-acoustic oscillations [2–4].
In a highly dissi-
pative regime, the ion-acoustic quasi-mode is no longer
a plasma eigenmode. Thus, it is more natural (accord-
ing Refs. [5,6]) to view the mechanism of Landau damp-
ing of Alfv´en waves as particle trapping by both the
magnetic mirror force and electric ﬁeld. On account
of the inevitable mathematical diﬃculties of a kinetic
approach, many numerical simulations have been per-
formed. DNLS-based simulations with beam pumping
(comet modeling) [7,8], hybrid magnetohydrodynamic-
particle simulations [9,10], hybrid particle ions-ﬂuid elec-
trons simulations [11–13] have been performed.

In a previous paper [14], we systematically accounted
for ion kinetic eﬀects (but neglected ﬁnite conductiv-
ity, discussed elsewhere [3,15]) on parallel and slightly
oblique propagating waves in homogeneous plasma, to
the order at which the DNLS is derived. A ﬂuid repre-
sentation for Landau damping [16] allowed us to derive a

relatively simple evolution equation for ﬁnite amplitude
Alfv´en waves in ﬁnite-β environments, typical of the so-
lar wind. Collisional damping was also included. For
slightly oblique propagation, the eﬀects of ﬁnite Larmor
radius result in nonlinear dispersion-type integral terms.
The terms which describe kinetic eﬀects are usually inte-
gral (nonlocal) in nature, and reﬂect the ﬁnite ion transit
time through the envelope modulation of an Alfv´en train.
However, for the weakly collisional (viscous) dissipation
and for the small Larmor radius limits, these integral op-
erators asymptote to (local) diﬀerential operators. This
is not the case for Landau damping, since no intrinsic
scale exists. The envelope evolution equation obtained
is thus a nonlocal, integro-diﬀerential equation which is
not not amenable to analytical solution.

In this paper, we explore numerical solution of the
kinetically modiﬁed derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger
(KNLS) equation. Some preliminary results of this in-
vestigation are given in Ref. [17]. We again classify the
solutions by the kinetic eﬀects which are taken into ac-
count. For simplicity, we usually consider parallel prop-
agating waves, however the results are valid for oblique
waves since they still obey the KNLS equation [18,19,14].
We discover that (especially for the case of Landau
damping) new types of waveform emerge. The known
observed “ﬁnal states” of nonlinear wave steepening (i.e.
shock structures) are classiﬁed as:

1.) collisional (hydrodynamic) shocks for which non-
linear steepening is limited by collisional (viscous)
dissipation, which sinks energy from small scales
(i.e. from high-k harmonics);

2.) collisionless

shocks

(common in astrophysical
plasma) in which nonlinear steepening is limited by
dispersion resulting in soliton-type structures with
suﬃcient energy content in high-k harmonics.

A new, large class of waveforms, dissipative structures,
appears when dissipation acts on all scales (recall Landau
damping has no intrinsic characteristic scale). Thus, we
add

3.) dissipative structures, for which nonlinear steep-
ening is limited by collisionless (scale invariant)
damping. Harmonic spectra of such structures con-
tain predominantly low-k harmonics, i.e. energy
resides at small scales. Fast rotation of the of wave
magnetic ﬁeld vector (i.e. rotational or directional
discontinuity formation) is another common feature
of these structures.

Numerous in situ observations of the solar wind mag-
netic activity have revealed the nonlinear nature of MHD
waves [20,21]. Recent observations indicate the existence
re-
of directional (e.g.
gions of rapid phase jumps where the amplitude also
varies [20,22]. Several types of directional/rotational dis-
continuities which might be distinguished by their phase
portraits have been observed. There are (i) discontinu-
ities of the “S-type”, at which the magnetic ﬁeld vector
rotates ﬁrst through some angle (less than or close to
90◦) in one direction, followed by rotation in the oppo-
site direction through an angle larger than 180◦ (typi-
cally, 180◦ < ∆φ
270◦) [22,23], and (ii) arc-polarized
discontinuities, where the magnetic ﬁeld vector rotates
along an arc through an angle less than 180◦ [20,24]. At

paper that all these commonly occurring wave structures
are manifested in the nonlinear evolution of Alfv´en waves
in ﬁnite β, isothermal plasma for diﬀerent initial condi-
tions and propagation angle.

The theory of nondissipative Alfv´en waves governed
by the conservative DNLS equation predicts nonlinear
wave steepening and formation of waveforms with steep
fronts. These waveforms are unstable to modulations.
Thus, spiky, many-soliton structures are emitted from
the steep edge. These oscillatory, (roughly) circularly po-
larized soliton-like structues interact nonlinearly to yield
strongly turbulent, spatially irregular wave proﬁles [see
next section]. However, the DNLS theory fails to explain
the formation of rotational and directional discontinu-
ities. A further step was to include the linear damping
of Alfv´en waves due to ﬁnite plasma conductivity. It was
shown that the nonlinear wave relaxes to a shock train
and constant-B rotational discontinuities that rotate the

ﬁeld through exactly 180◦ [25,26,1]. Inspite of this, the
DNLS theory was unable to explain the existance and
dynamics of both (i) the S-polarized directional and ro-
tational discontinuities and (ii) arc-polatized rotational
discontinuities with rotation of less than 180◦. Recent
particle code simulations [11–13] have shown that Landau
damping may drastically change the dynamics of Alfv´en
waves and result in the emergence of such wave struc-
tures.

In this paper, we use a recently developed [14] ana-
lytical model of the KNLS equation to investigate the
inﬂuence of Landau damping and several other kinetic
eﬀects on the dynamics of Alfv´en waves. The main claim
of this paper is that all the discontinuous wave struc-
tures discussed above are distinct solutions of the same
simple analytical model for diﬀerent initial conditions,
e.g.
initial wave polarization and wave propagation an-
gle. A (quasi-) parallel, initially circularly polarized, am-
plitude modulated wave evolves to a single, purely cir-
cular, lowest-k harmonic decoupled from dissipation. A
(quasi-) parallel linearly polarized wave forms a dissipa-
tive structure which is characterized by S-type, fast phase
rotation and moderate amplitude variation, i.e. has the
requisite properties for classiﬁcation as a localized, S-
type directional/rotational discontinuity. Such discon-
tinuities are intrinsically dissipative, as their amplitude
continuously decreases with time. An obliquely prop-
agating wave forms an arc-type rotational discontinuity,
which does not experience even minimal dissipation. The
eﬀects of ﬁnite Larmor radius (signiﬁcant at oblique an-
gles) are shown to tend to suppress arc-polarized struc-
ture formation. Low-k, ﬁnite-amplitude circular waves
form instead. Collisional (diﬀusive) dissipation of a pon-
deromotively driven acoustic mode is signiﬁcant (even
in a weakly collisional plasma) if the β value is close to
unity, thus increasing plasma temperature in this region.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we discuss the method of calculation, initial
conditions and standard DNLS solutions (i.e. the limit-
ing case of β = 0). In Section III, we solve the KNLS
for the case of Landau damping. In Section IV, we in-
vestigate an eﬀect of collisional damping. In Section V,
the inﬂuence of ﬁnite Larmor radius corrections on the
dynamics of slightly obliquely propagating waves is in-
vestigated. Section VI presents a summary of the result
obtained and some concluding remarks.

It is interesting ﬁrst to investigate the inﬂuence of Lan-
dau damping on a (previously) stable envelope soliton
wave train. Figs. 3a-3e depict the KNLS waveforms,

energy degradation and a snapshot of ﬂuctuating ﬁelds

collisionless dissipation is apparent from the decreasing
amplitude and increasing width of the waveform (Fig.
3a). Energy “inverse cascades” and accumulates in large
scales (low-k harmonics), as shown in Fig. 3c. Note that
the temporal energy evolution can be separated into two
phases (see Fig. 3d), namely a period of rapid damping

The time evolution of an initially linearly polarized
parallel propagating wave for the same plasma parame-

proﬁles for four times τ = 0, 1, 5, 40. Localized quasi-
stationary structures are seen to form very rapidly, the

formation time is τf ∼
and the width of the structures increases with time, due
to dissipation. Fig. 4b represents the phase portrait of
the structures at times τ = 1, 5, 40. The dissipative
structures exhibit an easily distinguishable “S-shaped”
diagram. It is worth to mention that this characteristic
shape is well preserved for a wide range of plasma param-
eters and may be considered a signature of (collisionless)
damping (see also Section IV). The harmonic spectrum
of the dissipative structures is narrow, with most energy
associated with low-k harmonics (Fig. 4c). For example,
for τ = 40 the harmonic tail is almost negligible after
10. Energy decay is shown in Fig. 4d. No distinct

Figs. 5 show the observed localized structures at τ = 15
in more detail. It is seen (Figs. 5a and 5b) that regions of
signiﬁcant ﬁeld variations are accompanied by fast phase
rotation through (approximately) π radians. However,
, linear polariza-
in the regions of negligibly varying
|
tion is preserved. This is easily seen from comparison
of Figs. 5b and 5d. At the discontinuity (path A-B-C)
the magnetic ﬁeld vector completes a rotation through
π radians (Fig. 5d). During the subsequent quescent
region (path C-D), the magnetic ﬁeld vector resides at
the “tip” of the left arm indicating pure linear polar-
ization. At the next discontinuity the vector returns to
the initial position, similarly completing a π radian ro-
tation, as shown by dashed path in Fig. 5d. Thus, the
KNLS dissipative structures have the requisite proper-
ties to be identiﬁed as localized, rotational/directional
discontinuities, as recently observed in the solar wind
[22,23]. Note, however, these KNLS rotational discon-
tinuities are associated with the regions of varying

ison with other cases below that there is no sharp diﬀer-
ence between a rotational and directional discontinuity.
One may be transformed into another by changing the
initial wave polarization and propagation angle. Hence,
we use both words to denote the S-type KNLS discon-
tinuity. We should also note the remarkable similarity
of hodographs obtained by solution of the KNLS equa-
tion and from full numerical plasma simulations [11]. We
emphasize the quasi-stationary character of the KNLS
discontinuities, with waveform shape preserved for thou-
sands of cyclotron times. The structures exhibit narrow,
localized spectra (Fig. 5c). The inverse spectrum width
deﬁnes the spatial localization of the discontinuity. Also,
the small-scale parasitic oscillations typical of the ﬂuid
DNLS are absent (they are probably inhibited by Lan-
dau damping at earlier stages of evolution). Such KNLS
discontinuities occur commonly and are not restricted to
β’s close to unity. These structures are quite evident in
a wide interval of β, of approximately 0.5-0.6 to 1.4-1.6.

The formation time increases from τf ∼

τf ∼
structures still form at smaller M2, however the forma-
tion time increases when M2 decreases. Wave proﬁles
and spectra still look like those in Figs. 4, 5. The phase
diagram, however, changes. Its central part expands and
the “arms” become thicker, so that the whole diagram
become similar to that shown in Fig. 17d for the case of
collisional dissipation. In all cases the phase discontinu-
ity is localized at the discontinuity of

In Figs. 6 the corresponding waveform dynamics for an
initially circularly polarized wave with sinusoidal ampli-
tude modulation is shown for the same plasma parame-
ters. In contrast to the previous case, circularly polarized
waves do not evolve into structures with discontinuities
(smooth, wave-like forms emerge). Rather, they evolve
in a few τ to a single (almost purely) circularly polarized
harmonic at the lowest k (Figs. 6b, 6c). A smooth, al-
most negligible amplitude modulation is imposed on the
wave. At these regions, weak, arc-polarized phase irreg-
ularities occur (see Fig. 6b,e). Such phase irregularities
are intermittent structures living just few τ , they carry
little energy (which is mostly in higher-k harmonics) and,
thus, disappear quickly. Energy decay (Fig. 6e) is sub-
stantial during the time of spectrum modiﬁcation, and
extremely slow at later times.

Figs. 7 depict the evolution of an initially elliptically
polarized wave, an intermediate case between purely cir-
cular and linear polarizations. Plasma parameters are the
same as in the previous cases. An elliptically polarized
wave evolves to a wave structure of slowly varying ampli-
tude (similar to the circular polarization case) as shown
in Fig. 7a. However, there are sudden phase jumps (by
π radians) which are localized at regions of varying wave
amplitude (typical of linear polarizations). These phase
discontinuities (which are the semi-circles in Fig. 7b) are
separated by extended regions of linear polarization dur-
ing which a tip of the magnetic ﬁeld vector resides at
small arms on the graph. Unlike the linear polarization

case, the phase discontinuity is not accompanied by the
wave amplitude discontinuity. A harmonic spectrum is
again suﬃciently narrow and most energy is associated
with large scales (see Fig. 7c). Energy dissipation is weak
in comparison to linear polarizations (Fig. 7d).

Obliquely propagating waves are still described by the
KNLS equation. However, a new wave ﬁeld which (for-
mally) contains a perpendicular projection component of
the ambient magnetic ﬁeld should be introduced. As-
suming the ambient ﬁeld lies in x-z-plane, we write the
new ﬁeld as

b = (bx + B0 sin Θ + iby)/B0.

(8)

The nonlinear evolution of the linearly and highly ellip-
tically polarized waves is strongly sensitive to the an-
gle between the polarization plane and the plane deﬁned
by the ambient magnetic ﬁeld vector and the direction
of wave propagation. This angle is set by initial con-
ditions. When this angle is small, the oscillating wave
magnetic ﬁeld has a longitudinal component along the
ambient ﬁeld. Thus, we refer such waves to as longitudi-
nal. In the opposite case, the wave magnetic ﬁeld oscil-
lates (nearly) perpendicularly to the ambient ﬁeld. Thus,
such waves are called transverse. Note that classiﬁcation
fails for circularly polarized waves, since a polarization
plane cannot be deﬁed in this case.

The time evolution of a transverse wave of initial lin-
ear polarization is shown in Fig. 8, for the same plasma
parameters and Θ = 45◦. Of course, such a value is
near the boundary of applicability of the KNLS. How-
ever, we run such an exaggerated case because (i) it takes
less computer time, as the nonlinear evolution is faster
and, thus, (ii) it looks more illustrative than those with
smaller Θ. No signiﬁcant physics is lost, anyway. The
wave proﬁles evolve into two KNLS rotational discon-
tinuities (as in the parallel propagation case) with the
typical “S-polarization” in a few τ (see Figs. 8a and 8b).
These discontinuities have diﬀerent group velocities, so
some time later (τ
15) they start to interact with
each other, as seen in Fig. 8c. Since these discontinu-
ities are characterized by opposite phase rotations, they
nearly totally annihilate one another duting the interac-
tion. The ﬁnal, residual structure has small amplitude
(b/B0
0.1), and is roughly arc-polarized, as seen in
Fig. 8d at τ = 30. This ﬁnal state is extremely weakly
damped (see Fig. 8f) because of the very small magnetic
ﬁeld perturbation amplitude of the waveform (damping
in KNLS is nonlinear!). Note here that due to redeﬁni-
tion of the wave ﬁeld, Eq. (8), the energy formally reads
as E = Ewave + (sin Θ)2, where the last term is not as-
sociated with a wave, but is just a new energy zero-level
due to the nonzero perpendicular component of the am-
bient ﬁeld. The harmonic spectrum evolution is shown
in Fig. 8e.

tion) to yield a weakly damped, small amplitude, quasi-
stationary, purely arc-polarized waveform (Fig. 9b). The
amplitude of the waveform is suﬃciently small (b/B0
≃
0.2), but larger than for linear polarization (note that

Such arc-polarized structures seem very similar to those
recently observed in the solar wind and identiﬁed with
arc-polarized rotational discontinuities [24]. We empha-
size the almost dissipationless character of such discon-
tinuities (Fig. 9d), inspite of their signiﬁcant harmonic
energy content, as seen from the broad spectrum in Figs.
9c, 10e. The energy evolution of oblique circularly polar-
ized waves (unlike all other cases) exhibits three diﬀerent
stages (see Fig. 9d): (i) the primary spectrum modiﬁca-
tion when two spatially localized wave structures emerge

A (quasi-) stationary, arc-polarized discontinuity is
shown in details in Figs. 10, for τ = 40. The discontinu-
ity is associated with minor (almost negligible) amplitude
modulation ( Fig. 10b). As seen from Figs. 10a,b,d, the
discontinuity is a localized structure of typically a disper-
vA/Ωi). The magnetic ﬁeld vector makes

through slightly less than π radians (path A-B-C). The
ends A and C are connected by a part of circularly polar-
ized wave packet (slow counterclockwise rotation in the
phase diagram, along the perfect arc C-D-A). Circular
polarization is indicated by smoothly decreasing phase
outside the discontinuity (Fig. 10a). Since

the discontinuity depicted in Fig. 10e is quite narrow

and of low amplitude (remember, the b0 harmonic corre-
sponds to the ambient ﬁeld, not the wave). Note the re-
markable similarity of this solution of the KNLS equation
to the structures detected in the solar wind and observed

The time

evolution of an elliptically polarized,
obliquely propagating, longitudinal wave (not shown) is
very similar to the case of parallel propagation until large
times (i.e. τ
60). At later times (τ > 60), an arc-
polarized rotational discontinuity forms. There the mag-
netic ﬁeld vector rotates rapidly rotation through an an-
gle of less than π radians.

The nonliear evolution of the transverse waves is com-
plitely diﬀerennt form that of the longitudinal waves, as
shown in Figs. 11. Such waves quickly evolve (i a few τ )
to an arc-polarized rotational discontinuity (Fig. 11a,b).

B. The two mode coupling model

±

To qualitatively understand the physical processes
which underly the behavior of dissipative nonlinear
Alfv´en waves (of linear and elliptical polarization), we
construct a simple two-mode coupling model. We as-
sume the spectrum consists of three low-k harmonics
k = 0,
1 (a ﬁnite amplitude k = 0 harmonic corre-
sponds to oblique propagation, b0 = B⊥/B0 = sin Θ.
This model is based on the results of numerical solutions
which show that only two (initially excited) k =
1 har-
monics dominate the spectra. Other higher-k spectrum
components are of relatively small amplitude and thus
can be neglected. We also neglect linear dispersion which
is signiﬁcant at the steep fronts, i.e.
for broad spectra,
only. Here we emphasize once again that we do not pre-
tend to give a quantitatively correct answer, but only
intend to get some insight into the essential physics.

We write the wave magnetic ﬁeld in the form b =
b+eiζ + b0 + b−e−iζ and substitute it into the KNLS
equation, Eq. (3), together with Eq. (6). The system

C. Discussion

The sharp contrast between the nonlinear evolution
of initially linearly (elliptically) and circularly polarized
parallel propagating wave trains is an immediate con-
sequence of the unique harmonic scaling of collisionless

(Landau) dissipation in the KNLS equation. Integration
of Eq. (1) with UN L deﬁned by Eq. (6) over all space
(assuming that b vanishes at inﬁnity) yields (in dimen-

2dζ is the total wave energy, and we

= 0.(This result have been reported also
b
h|
in Refs. [32,28].) Thus, the rate of energy dissipation is
controlled by the coupling coeﬃcient, M2 < 0. Also, we
conclude that higher-k harmonics are strongly damped
which is typical for a phase-mixing process (i.e. smaller
scales mix faster). It is crucial, however, to understand
that collisionless damping enters at all k, in contrast to
hydrodynamic systems where diﬀusion (viscosity) yields
dissipation only at large k (i.e.
small scales, or steep
gradient regions). Hence, competition of nonlinear har-
monic generation (i.e.
front steepening) and collision-
less damping produces a quasi-stationary energy spec-
trum which is a rapidly decreasing function of k, with the
long-time asymptotic behavior dominated by a few low-k
harmonics. Since linear polarizations have (initial) spec-
tra symmetric upon k
k, they couple more strongly
to dissipation than circular polarizations do. Moreover,
interaction of ﬁnite amplitude spectrum components nec-
essarily leads to higher-k harmonic generation and wave
steepening. Such interactions are excluded for pure circu-
lar polarization. Therefore, the circularly polarized wave
evolves to a single harmonic ﬁnal state, which is, itself,
a stationary (and exact) solution of the KNLS equation
(i.e. it experiences no steepening and minimal damping).
Since Landau damping enters symmetrically for +k
k spectrum components, it does not change the
and
initial symmetry of a spectrum, so that the sense of
an initial polarization (set by initial spectrum symme-
try) is preserved (neglecting feeble high-k, low-amplitude
asymmetry induced by steepening). Thus, KNLS evo-
lution preserves initial wave helicities forming direc-
tional/rotational discontinuities at the edges of the re-
gions of linear (elliptical) polarization. These direc-
tional/rotational discontinuities are localized at regions
of strong amplitude variations, unlike the conventional
view [1] where the shock and rotational discontinuity
are well separated and have diﬀerent group velocities.
The KNLS directional/rotational discontinuities display
a well distinguished S-shaped phase portrait which can
be considered a footprint of the occurrence of strong Lan-
dau damping in satellite observations. Since the KNLS

−

7

equation preserves (initial) wave helicity [30,31] , rota-
tional discontinuities do not form from circularly polar-
ized waves. Given that circular polarizations decay much
more slowly than linear polarizations do, the results sug-
gest that large-scale circularly polarized waves should
occur more frequently than small scale discontinuities
which evolve from linear polarizations (given comparable
initial populations), especially at large distances from the
Sun.

Oblique and quasi-perpendicular,

linearly polarized
waves ﬁrst evolve to two KNLS directional/rotational dis-
continuities of opposite phase rotation propagating with
diﬀerent group velocities, so that they ﬁnally merge and
annihilate to yield weakly-nonlinear, small amplitude,
arc-polarized waves. Despite the fact that oblique, circu-
larly polarized waves do not form KNLS rotational dis-
continuities, their ﬁnal state is similar to (but of larger
amplitude than) that of a linear polarization. Since,
oblique and quasi-perpendicular (both linear and circu-
lar polarizations) waves are coupled to the ambient mag-
netic ﬁeld B⊥ = B0 sin Θ, which is usually (much) larger
than the ﬂuctuating wave ﬁeld b, the process of energy
⊥/b2 times faster for such waves. Wave-
dissipation is B2
forms again evolve to the lowest-k state which is now the
single harmonic b0 = B⊥/B0 (which corresponds to the
ambient ﬁeld component, not the wave perturbed ﬁeld)
indicating dissipation of all wave energy. Thus, the ﬁ-
nal state of nonlinear evolution for “oﬀ-axis” propagat-
ing waves is a (very) small amplitude, weakly-nonlinear,
weakly-damped, arc-polarized Alfv´en wave packet. Pure
arc-polarized waveforms (which develop from circular po-
larizations) have much in common with the structures
recently observed in the solar wind and identiﬁed with
arc-polarized rotational discontinuities [24]. Such struc-
tures experience minimal damping. The comparably fast
damping of oblique and quasi-perpendicular waves sug-
gests that most magnetic ﬂuctuations should occur at
small angles to the ambient ﬁeld (given initial isotropic
ﬂuctuations) resulting in large turbulence levels in par-
allel and quasi-parallel directions and small turbulence
levels in quasi-perpendicular directions where Alfv´enic
turbulence is suﬃciently suppressed.

As in the case of collisionless dissipation, we ﬁrst in-

wave envelope, Eqs. (5a)-(5b), since it is stable in ab-
sence of any dissipation. Solutions at diﬀerent times are
shown in Figs. 13 with κ = 100 and β = 0.99. We shall
see that collisional dissipation is strongest when κ
k,
i.e. when the dissipation scale is comparable with a typ-
ical wave-length of a train. We again (as with Landau
damping) see rapid primary spectrum and spatial proﬁle
modiﬁcation (Figs. 13c,a, respectively) and formation of
a quasi-stationary solution with negligible energy degra-
dation (Fig. 13d). The hodographs are shown at three
times τ = 0, 4, 25 in Fig. 13b. The steady-state proﬁles
of bx and by are shown separately in Fig. 13e. We should
mention that the eﬀect of collisional damping is signiﬁ-
cant only for β very close to unity.

∼

The nonlinear evolution of an initially linear polariza-
tion (in β = 0.99 plasma) is shown in Figs. 14, 15, 16 for
weakly collisional (κ = 200), intermediate (κ = 20), and
strongly collisional (κ = 2) regimes, respectively. Energy
dissipation is represented in Figs. 18. In a weakly colli-
sional regime (Figs. 14), a wave experiences steepening of
the back front, as a result of nonlinear dispersion set by
the sign of κ (or L) which, in turn, depends on plasma β.
Since the nonlinear dispersion is positive in this case, it
competes with the linear (negative) dispersion. The non-
linear dispersion is most important in regions of a high
3), while
wave magnetic ﬁeld (since it is proportional to
|
conventional linear dispersion [last term in Eq. (1)] is im-
portant where
is small. Parasitic small-scale circularly
polarized oscillations appear on the steep fronts when
wave steepening is limited by dispersion (Figs. 14a,b).
These parasitic harmonics, however, disappear quickly
as a consequence of the fact that high-k components are
strongly coupled to dissipation. The magnetic ﬁeld vec-
tor rotates rapidly at the steepened edge of the wave.
After the phase of nonlinear steepening, a propagating
shock wave separates from the (standing) phase rotation
region (i.e. the rotational discontinuity). The width of
the shock front is controlled by collision length L and

its amplitude gradually decreases due to damping (Fig.
14c). Such a process is remarkably similar to that ﬁrst
discussed by Cohen and Kulsrud [1]. However, it is just
one limiting case (κ
) of the KNLS wave evolu-
tion. The spatial width of the rotational discontinuities
is controlled by dispersion. Hodographs of rotational dis-
continuities presented in Fig. 14d are diﬀerent from the
Cohen-Kulsrud case. Here the magnetic ﬁeld vector b
makes a counterclockwise rotation through some angle
(typically 50◦
90◦) and than makes a clockwise rotation
to complete a total 180◦ phase jump across the disconti-
nuity. As shown in Fig. 14e, harmonic spectra are broad,
as collisional damping enters at small scales k

κ.

−

b
|

Figs. 15 correspond to intermediate collisional damp-
ing (κ = 20). Parasitic small-scale, small amplitude os-
cillations are still emitted from the seepened front (Fig.
15a,b). Propagating shocks (Fig. 15c) are suﬃciently
broad and disappear at a higher rate than those in the
weakly collisional case. Rotational discontinuities are lo-
vari-
calized at the regions of signiﬁcant amplitude
ations, and the typical hodograph takes on an S-shape
(however, with “inﬂated”, almost semicircular central
part). The harmonic spectrum is narrower than in the
κ = 200 case (Fig. 15e). The rotational discontinuities
move slowly to the right (as with Landau dissipation).
Neither the sign of κ, nor the direction of shock wave
propagation aﬀect the propagation direction of these
phase discontinuities. More details of this case are shown
in Figs. 17 at τ = 15. A remarkable similarity of these
ﬁgures to those of Figs. 5 (Landau damping case) indi-
cates a lack of a characteristic dissipation scale in the
system, i.e. the dissipation scale is comparable with a
typical wave-length, κ

k.

|

The strong collisional regime is represented in Figs. 16.
This case exactly corresponds to that with Landau damp-
ing, since collisional and wave lengths are equal (note, the
k-scaling of damping is diﬀerent). No small-scale har-
monics emerge, and shock wave generation is suppressed
by damping (Fig. 16a), as typical of Landau dissipation
S-shaped hodograph displays (Fig. 16b). Most of the
energy is located in a few low-k harmonics (Fig. 16c).
For a more strongly collisional regime (κ = 0.2, results
are not shown) the eﬀect of dissipation becomes weaker,
and wave evolution becomes similar to that of the weakly
damped wave case. This eﬀect is associated with the
weakness of the resonant coupling (deﬁned by Q2 coeﬃ-
cient) of Alfv´en and ion-acoustic waves.

The temporal evolution of wave energy is shown in Fig.
18a for several collisional regimes, from weak collisional-
ity (κ = 200) to a collision dominated plasma (κ = 0.2).
Fig. 18b depicts total wave energy content as a function
k)−1] at dif-
of κ [i.e. heat conduction coeﬃcient as (χc
ferent times τ = 5, 10, 20. The energy dissipation rate
increases with collisionality (i.e. with decrease of κ) un-
1 and decreases for κ < 1. The last eﬀect is due
til κ
to the weak coupling of Alfv´en and ion-acoustic waves
(the coeﬃcient Q2), which occures when the ion-acoustic

∼

∼

frequency becomes smaller than its collisional damping
rate.

−

Since the sign of κ (or L) deﬁnes the sign of nonlin-
ear dispersion, we also considered the case of β > 1.
Traces of typical evolution are depicted in Fig. 19 for
κ =
20 and β = 1.01. In this case both linear and non-
linear dispersions are negative (and do not compete), so
many small scale oscillations appear at the (sharp) front
of a wave train (Fig. 19a,b). This “ noisy” harmonic
generation is possibly related to the modulation instabil-
ity of steep fronts against small-scale modulations [14].
The instability growth rate in the collisionless regime
decreases with increasing wave amplitude. In the colli-
sional regime, the growth rate is amplitude independent.
Thus, the large amplitude suppression which is the case
for collisionless damping is absent for diﬀusively dissi-
pative Alfv´en waves. Further evolution of Alfv´en trains
generally follows the previous cases where β < 1.

Circular polarizations evolve similarly to the Landau
damping case. Despite the emergence of a shock wave
(especially in a weakly collisional plasma), they do not
evolve to rotational discontinuities. Instead, they gener-
ate smooth waveforms with irregular phase rotation. The
sign of κ again deﬁnes the sign of dispersion. Its value
controls spatial scales. The result of dissipative evolu-
tion is a dominant (lowest-k), circular harmonic and a
low-amplitude harmonic background tail, spreading up
to scales k
κ. For illustration, Figs. 20 show evolu-
tion of a circularly polarized wave in a weakly dissipative
plasma (more typical for astrophysical situations) with
β = 0.99 and κ = 200.

∼

B. Discussion

A signiﬁcant diﬀerence between collisional (diﬀusive)
and collisionless (Landau) dissipation is the existence of
a characteristic collisional scale for the former case. As
usual, it represents a “boundary” between the weakly and
the strongly damped (i.e.
low and high-k, respectively)
parts of wave spectra. Integrating Eq. (1) with UN L from
Eq. (23) over space (see Section III), we obtain:

Thus, energy dissipation is controlled by both the coeﬃ-
cient Q2 < 0 (which, in turn, controls the coupling of the
Alfv´enic mode to the damped ion-acoustic mode), and
k. Unlike the colli-

of κ deﬁnes the sign of nonlinear dispersion (e.g. steep-
ening direction, etc.) and does not aﬀect the dissipa-
tion rate. Since most spectral energy is associated with
suﬃciently small-k components, the integral in Eq. (25)
increases with decreasing κ until κ is about unity. For
smaller κ the integral is approximately constant. The
coupling coeﬃcient Q2 decreases with decreasing κ (for
constant β). The higher the plasma collisionality, the
weaker the resonance of Alfv´en and ion-acoustic waves,
and thus the smaller Q2 is. Thus, the energy dissipation
rate is maximum when the dissipation length is compara-
ble with a typical wave-length. For a strongly collisional
regime, ion-acoustic wave damping rate becomes larger
than its frequency, so that ion-acoustic perturbations are
no longer a plasma eigenmode. Resonant coupling and
energy transfer from an Alfv´enic mode to ion-acoustic os-
cillations is weak, despite strong dissipation of the latter.
One may mention the interesting case of strong damp-

ing (κ
wave). In this case, the system evolves as if
subject to collisionless dissipation, i.e. S-polarized KNLS
dissipative structures emerge from linear polarizations
and circular polarizations quickly evolve to a single har-
monic state. However, such a scale-free regime may occur

occurrence in nature, this case allows us to understand
physical the reasons underlying the uniqueness of colli-
sionless (Landau) dissipation for Alfv´en wave dynamics.
) seems more
typical for astrophysical and space plasmas. Nonlinear
steepening of a wave front is ﬁrst limited by nonlinear dis-
persion, giving rise to radiation of small-scale, circularly
polarized, noisy parasitic oscillations by the steep front
(probably due to modulational instability). These oscil-
lations damp quickly. At later times, the front separates
into a shock wave moving in the direction of primary wave
steepening and a waveform the type of which (e.g. direc-
tional or rotational discontinuity, small-scale phase mod-
ulations, etc.) depends on the initial wave polarization.
For initially linear polarizations, this waveform is a rota-
tional discontinuity (with a weak amplitude modulation
imposed on it). For circular polarizations, it is an inter-
mittent, wavy structure (the amplitude of perturbations
of
decreases with time), carrying weak, roughly arc-
polarized phase irregularities. The rotational discontinu-
ity (for β < 1) consists of partially counterclockwise rota-
tion through some angle (typically 50◦
90◦) followed by
clockwise rotation through an angle larger than 180◦ to
complete a 180◦ phase diﬀerence across the discontinuity.
These waveforms have a characteristic spatial scale set by
dispersion. The propagating shock wave front is much
narrower and controlled by collisions. The amplitude of
a shock decreases with time due to collisional (diﬀusive)
dissipation. The residual waveforms are weakly coupled

First, one may notice that there is no sharp transition
from the Λ2 > 0 regime to the Λ2 < 0 regime. Second,
gyro-averaging the wave ﬁelds results in nonlinear dis-
persion of waves. It does not introduce additional dissi-
pation. It may, however, generate (due to modulational
instability) a large number of strongly damped high-k
harmonics. Thus, it may aﬀect the wave damping pro-
cess.

Figs. 21 and 22 depict the evolution of linearly and
circularly polarized initial conditions (respectively) in
β < 1 environment for κ = 3000 which corresponds to
0.08. The angle of wave propagation is Θ = 45◦
kρi ≃
in both cases. There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence observed
in the evolution of an oblique linear polarization for zero
and ﬁnite Larmor radii (compare Figs. 8 and 21, respec-
tively). Quasi-stationary KNLS dissipative structures
(i.e. rotational discontinuities with
= const) form
during the evolution. The width of each is controlled
by both linear and nonlinear (due to gyro-kinetic eﬀects)
dispersion. The harmonic spectrum, however, is more ir-
regular than in the case of zero Larmor radius (Fig. 21c).
In contrast, an obliquely propagating, circularly polar-
ized wave behaves diﬀerently, and its evolution is closer
to the parallel propagating case. No arc-polarized struc-
ture forms from an initially circular polarization. Only
a waveform with dominantly low-k circularly polarized
harmonic forms instead (Fig. 22b).

increased width (set by dispersion), despite the fact that
their group velocities are similar. The combined eﬀects

We should mention another interesting case (results

are not shown). For β < 1 and comparably small
|
|
(
100), solutions of the KNLS equation are un-
≤
stable, i.e. the amplitudes of several harmonics increase
rapidly with time. Our program does not allow us to
follow the full dynamics of such solutions, because a fast
Fourier transform (used in the program) works correctly
only when harmonic amplitude vanishes quickly with in-
creasing k. Note however that the perturbative deriva-
tion of the KNLS fails in this case, too. The physical
understanding of this instability is discussed in the next
subsection.

B. Discussion

It is easily seen that ﬁnite Larmor radius corrections
alone do not introduce a damping process of any kind.
Nevertheless, they can change the energy dissipation rate
via collisionless damping Indeed, it can even change the
sign of the dissipation, as will be discussed later. Using
our previous results, namely Eqs. (22) and (25), we may
now easily write

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the inﬂuence of various kinetic eﬀects
(e.g. Landau and diﬀusive dissipation as well as eﬀects
of the gyro-averaging of ﬂuctuating ﬁelds on a Larmor
radius scale) were investigated in detail. A tractable an-
alytic evolution equation, the KNLS equation, was nu-
merically solved to study nonlinear dynamics of ﬁnite-
Te
amplitude coherent Alfv´en waves in a ﬁnite-β, Ti ≃
plasma, natural to the solar wind. Previous DNLS stud-
ies failed to describe the evolution of the wide class of
discontinuous waveforms which were recently observed in
the solar wind. These waveforms are the (i) arc-polarized
rotational discontinuities with phase diﬀerence less and
equal to π and (ii) S-polarized rotational and directional
discontinuities. Current study shows that all these dis-
continuous wave structures discussed are distinct solu-
tions of the same simple analytical KNLS model for dif-
ferent initial conditions, e.g. initial wave polarization and
wave propagation angle. The results are summarized in
Table I.

I. Collisionless (Landau) damping introduces a unique
scale invariant dissipation process into the dynamics of
Alfv´enic trains. In contrast to viscous/diﬀusive dissipa-
tion, Landau damping is not restricted to small scales.
Thus, it is not surprisingly that the harmonic content of
collisionless dissipative waveforms tends to be dominated

by large scales, with most wave energy contained in the
low-k harmonics. Since there is no characterictic dissi-
pation scale in the system, the scale of the disssipative
stuctures is set by dispersion, alone (a l`a collisionless soli-
tons and shock waves). The dynamics of Alfv´en waves
is sensitive to their sense of polarization, as well as to
their propagation direction with respect to the ambient
magnetic ﬁeld. The principal results are:

β

≤

≤

1. (quasi-), parallel initially linearly polarized waves
evolve rapidly to form dissipative structures sep-
linearly polarized Alfv´en
arated by regions of
waves. These structures, which are naturally quasi-
stationary, extend the traditional genre of colli-
sionless shocks to encompass the structures oc-
curred via the competition of harmonic generation
(i.e. nonlinear wave steepening) and collisionless
(Landau) damping, rather than dispersion (i.e. as
for solitons). Such structures are commonly oc-
curring over a wide range of plasma β, roughly:
1.5. These structures are character-
0.5
ized by fast phase changes (phase jumps). Namely,
the magnetic ﬁeld vector rotates ﬁrst through some
angle (typically, 50◦
90◦), followed by rotation
in the opposite direction through an angle larger
than 180◦ to complete the total π radian phase
change. The phase diagram of the wave displays
a distinct S-shape, which allows us to relate these
dissipative structures to a class of S-type direc-
tional/rotational discontinuities observed in the so-
lar wind. Unlike conventional rotational disconti-
2 = const, these KNLS rota-
nuities, for which
|
tional/directional discontinuities exhibit signiﬁcant
amplitude variation across the phase jumps. The
amplitude of these variations depends on the an-
gle of propagation and is largest for exactly parallel
propagation. The KNLS rotational/directional dis-
continuities have small velocity in the wave frame.
Their directions are deﬁned by the sign of the non-
linearity coeﬃcient M1 (the discontinuity propa-
gates with the wave for M2 > 0). The dissipa-
tive character of these structures is revealed by
their increasing width and decreasing amplitude.
Dissipation is strong in this case, and energy de-
cays roughly as E(τ )
Since the
∝
KNLS directional/rotational discontinuities display
a prominent S-shaped phase portrait, they can (po-
tentially) be regarded as a signature of strong Lan-
dau damping at work in satellite observations.

2. (quasi-) parallel, initially circular polarizations do
not form discontinuities. Since Landau damping
preserves the initial symmetry of the harmonic
spectrum, circular polarizations form intermittent,
roughly arc-polarized waveforms which dissipate
quickly, yielding purely circularly polarized waves
at the lowest k. Such waves experience no nonlin-
ear steepening and minimal damping. The diﬀer-
ent evolution of linear and circular polarizations is

12

due to speciﬁc coupling of the waves to collisionless
damping, which is, in turn, sensitive to the (initial)
symmetry of the harmonic spectrum.

3. (quasi-) parallel,

initially elliptically polarized
waves represent an intermediate case between lin-
ear and circular polarizations. Well localized, rota-
tional discontinuities (similar to dissipative struc-
tures) form. They are separated by large regions
of linearly polarized waves. Amplitude variations
across the discontinuities are small. These wave-
forms are more weakly coupled to dissipation. The

5. oblique, initially circularly polarized waves and el-
liptically polarized, longitudinal waves do not gener-
ate dissipative structures. Despite this, they evolve
to stationary waveforms with negligible amplitude
and large phase variations. Their phase diagram
displays a pure arc, with the arc-angle less than
180◦. Fast magnetic vector rotation along the arc
at the discontinuity is followed by a part of an op-
positely rotating circularly polarized wave. Thus,
these structures have all requisites to be identi-
ﬁed with arc-polarized rotational discontinuities ob-
served in the solar wind. This waveform experi-
ences no damping and nonlinear steepening. How-
ever, the energy content of this waveform is not
small.

6. oblique, transverse waves evolve to stationary arc-
polarized rotational discontinuities with the arc-
angle less than 180◦. The energy content of this
waveform is large.

According to the discussion above, nonlinear Alfv´en
waves subject to damping on resonant particles evolve
to narrow-spectrum waveforms with most energy con-
centrated in lowest-k harmonics. The initial spectrum
symmetry (i.e. the wave polarization) is generally pre-
served during the evolution. Based on the above, one can
suggest that (given initial equal populations of isotropi-
cally distributed circular and linear polarizations) quasi-

parallel magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations will consist of pre-
dominantly circularly polarized waves and lower ampli-
tude S-polarized KNLS directional discontinuities, while
oblique perturbations are predominantly arc-polarized
discontinuities, separated by pieces of oppositely circu-
larly polarized waves. One should emphasize that all
wave structures emerge naturally through the nonlinear
evolution of simple, sinusoidally amplitude modulated
Alfv´en waves with no a priori assumptions or special ini-
tial conditions used.

II. The dynamics of nonlinear Alfv´en wave trains
subject to diﬀusive (collisional) damping diﬀer signiﬁ-
cantly. There are two diﬀerent regimes of weak and
strong plasma collisionality, controlled by the ratio of
dissipation length L to the typical wavelength λ,
i.e.
L

| ≪
1. The eﬀect of collisions introduces nonlinear dis-
persion into the dynamics, along with a nonlinear
damping process. Thus it aﬀects the direction of
steepening, rate of spectrum modiﬁcation, etc..

λ, respectively. The results are:

λ and

L
|

| ≥

2. The sign of L deﬁnes the sign of nonlinear disper-
sion which, in turn, is controlled by plasma β, i.e.
β). Thus, for β < 1 and β > 1, nonlinear
L
steepening occurs at the rear and front edges of a
train, respectively.

(1

∝

−

L
|

3. The absolute value of L aﬀects the dissipation rate.
λ. In
The damping rate has a maximum near
the weakly collisional regime, the dissipation pro-
cess is slower on account of infrequent collisions.
However in higher collisionality plasma, the acous-
tic mode is strongly damped, so it is no longer a
plasma eigenmode (i.e. ω < γ, here γ is the damp-
ing rate). Thus, resonant energy transfer from
Alfv´enic to acoustic waves is suppressed.

| ≃

4. In a weakly collisional regime, a nonlinear wave
evolves to a propagating shock wave (the direction
of propagation coincides with the direction of wave
steepening) and a rotational discontinuity or phase
irregularities, depending on an initial polarization,
i.e. whether the initial polarization is linear or cir-
cular, respectively. The shock amplitude gradually
decreases due to damping. The thickness of the
shock is controlled by collisions, however the spa-
tial size of the phase discontinuity/irregularities is
larger and controlled by dispersion. In a strongly
collisional regime, the wave evolution is much sim-
ilar to the case of Landau damping. Obviously, the
system lacks the characteristic dissipation scale in
this limit, i.e.

λ.

L
|

| ∼

5. The dissipation process is very sensitive (especially
in weakly collisional plasma) to the value of β, and
sharply peaked at β equal to unity. If one assume
β = β(R) is a function of the distance from the sun,
then waves generated near the sun and propagating

13

outward will be strongly damped at the distance
Rd deﬁned by β(Rd) = 1. One can, thus, expect
increased plasma temperature in this region, as well
as decreased magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation level (i.e.
characteristic amplitude of Alfv´en waves) beyond
this point, i.e. at distances R > Rd. This process
may be important, however, when the width of the
dissipation region is large enough (comparable to
or exceeding the typical wavelength). This is, in
turn, controlled by the spatial proﬁle of β.

III. Eﬀects of ﬁnite Larmor radius impact the dy-
namics of obliquely propagating waves, only. They are
associated with small-scale gyro-averaging of ﬂuctuating
ﬁelds on a scale of Larmor orbits of plasma particles.
These eﬀects

1. introduce nonlinear dispersion controlled by the
plasma β, Larmor scale ρi, and angle of propaga-
tion Θ.

2. typically suppress the formation of arc-polarized
discontinuities from initially circular polarizations,
but do not change the qualitative evolution of lin-
ear polarizations.

3. aﬀect the wave energy damping rate in high-β
plasma (β > 1) and may even change the sign of the
dissipation in low-β plasma (β < 1). The last case
corresponds to an instability. Thus, as a result of
gyro-motion of resonant particles interacting with
a wave packet (in β < 1 plasma), an ion-cyclotron
resonance occurs.
It results in damping of low-k
harmonics and growth (instability) of high-k har-
monics, which interact with the tail of a particle
distribution function. Thus, small-scale bursts may
be generated in this regime.

A more detailed investigation of obliquely propagating
waves will be presented in future publications.

FIG. 14. Wave evolution for the KNLS with collisional damping with β = 0.99 and κ = 200 (weakly collisional regime) for
parallel propagating, linearly polarized sinusoidal wave initial condition. (a) and (c) - wave proﬁles, (b) and (d) - hodographs,
(e) - harmonic spectra. At τ = 0 only k = 1, −1 harmonics are excited. Note the formation of propagating shock waves (sharp
fronts) and rotational discontinuities (wider wave-like forms). The noisy parasitic oscillations generated at earlier times (τ = 1)
are possibly due to modulation instability, which is stronger for smaller scale modulations.

for parallel propagating, linearly polarized sinusoidal wave initial condition. (a) and (c) - wave proﬁles, (b) and (d) - hodographs,
(e) - harmonic spectra. At τ = 0 only k = 1, −1 harmonics are excited. The width of a shock wave is wider (as controlled
by collisions), however the width of the rotational discontinuity is the same, i.e. it is controlled by the dispersion parameter,
alone.

The electromagnetic radiation pressure becomes dominant in the interaction of

the ultra-intense electromagnetic wave with a solid material, thus the wave energy

can be transformed eﬃciently into the energy of ions representing the material and

the high density ultra-short relativistic ion beam is generated. This regime can be

seen even with present-day technology, when an exawatt laser will be built. As an

application, we suggest the laser-driven heavy ion collider.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The permanent interest in the problems of the interaction of relativistically strong electro-

magnetic radiation with matter ﬁnds broad applications in the development of new concepts

of charged particle acceleration under space and laboratory conditions. The generation of

high energy particles, both electrons and ions, when strong electromagnetic radiation inter-

acts with a plasma, is a well known basic phenomenon. However in the limit of extremely

high radiation intensity it acquires new features. Under the earth conditions, an extremely

strong electromagnetic wave can be practically realized only with laser beams. When a

multi-petawatt laser pulse interacts with matter, conditions could be produced that were

imagined to occur only in astrophysical objects. This opens the way for experimental studies

of the properties of matter under these extreme conditions. With the further increase of the

laser power the laser based accelerators can provide the beams of the ultrarelativistic ions,

which makes feasible their applications in the high-energy physics.

Direct laser acceleration of protons to relativistic energies requires intensity Ip = 4.6 ×
1024 W/cm2 × (1 µm/λ)2, corresponding to the dimensionless amplitude a ≡ eE/meωc =

mp/me ≈ 1836, where E, λ, and ω are the electric ﬁeld, wavelength, and frequency of the

electromagnetic (EM) wave, e and me are the electron charge and mass, and mp is the

proton mass. In a plasma, due to collective eﬀects, protons can gain relativistic energies at

much less intensity, about 1021 W/cm2 × (1 µm/λ)2, as is exempliﬁed in the theory of the

strongly nonlinear hybrid electron-ion wakeﬁeld induced by a short EM wave packet with

the dimensionless amplitude a greater than (mp/me)1/2 ≈ 43 and the Coulomb explosion of

an overdense plasma region with the size of a few microns when a relativistically strong EM

wave sweeps all the electrons away [1]. In general, the laser-driven ion acceleration arises

from charge separation caused by the EM wave. Various regimes have been discussed in

the framework of this concept: the plasma thermal expansion into vacuum [2]; the Coulomb

explosion of a strongly ionized cluster [3]; transverse explosion of a self-focusing channel [4];

ion acceleration in the strong charge separtion ﬁeld caused by a quasi-static magnetic ﬁeld

[5].

In this paper we present the regime of the high density ultra-short relativistic ion beam

generation from a thin foil by an ultra-intense EM wave. We call this regime the ‘laser piston’

(LP). In contrast to previously discussed schemes, in this regime the ion beam generation

is highly eﬃcient and the ion energy per nucleon is proportional to the laser pulse energy.

Our analytical estimation conforms to the result of three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell

(PIC) simulations. In comparison with the experimental experience of present-day Petawatt

lasers, the LP regime predicts yet another advantage of the Exawatt lasers, in addition to

possible applications depicted in [6].

II. RADIATION PRESSURE DOMINANT REGIME

We distinguish the following two stages of the LP operation. (i) A relativistically strong

laser pulse irradiates a thin foil with thickness l and electron density ne. The laser pulse

waist is suﬃciently wide, so the quasi-one-dimensional geometry is in eﬀect. Electrons are

quickly accelerated up to ve ∼ c by the transverse electric ﬁeld, EL, of the laser pulse and

3

they are pushed in the forward (longitudinal) direction by the force |eve × BL/c| ≈ eEL,

where BL is the magnetic ﬁeld of the laser pulse. Assume that all the electrons are displaced

in the longitudinal direction, then the charge separation ﬁeld, Ek = 2πenel < EL, between

ﬁeld the ion energy Ei = (m2

the electron and ion layers does not depend on the separation distance. In this longitudinal
i c4 + (eEkct)2)1/2 become relativistic in a time of the order of
tri = (mic/eEk). We ﬁnd that the ion layer can be accelerated up to relativistic energies

during NL laser cycles under the condition EL > 2πenel & miωc/2πeNL. Hence, to produce

relativistic protons in one laser cycle we need an EM wave with EL > 300meωc/e, IL >
1.2 × 1023 W/cm2 × (1 µm/λ)2, and the pulse waist must be much greater than ctri ≃ λ.

(ii) The accelerated foil, which consists of the electron and ion layers, can be regarded as

a relativistic plasma mirror co-propagating with the laser pulse. Assume that the laser

pulse is perfectly reﬂected from this mirror. In the laboratory reference frame, before the

reﬂection it has the energy EL ∝ E2

EL ∝

L

e

LL, after the reﬂection its energy becomes much lower:
LL/4γ2. Here the incidence laser pulse length is equal to L, the reﬂected
L is longer by factor of 4γ2, and the transverse electric ﬁeld is smaller by

factor 4γ2, where γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2 is the Lorentz factor of the plasma mirror. Hence

e

the plasma mirror acquires the energy (1 − 1/4γ2)EL from the laser pulse. At this stage

the plasma (the electrons and, hence, ions) is accelerated due to the radiation pressure.

The radiation momentum is transfered to ions through the charge separation ﬁeld and the

‘longitudinal’ kinetic energy of ions is much greater than that of electrons. We note that

the speciﬁed intensity is close to the limit where individual electrons undergo a substantial

radiation friction eﬀect [7]. However, when the foil is accelerated up to relativistic energy,

this eﬀect becomes weaker because its strength measure, 4πre/3a3λ, is reduced by 2γ in the
foil reference frame (re = e2/mec2 is the classical electron radius).

We notice a connection of the plasma layer acceleration scheme, presented above, with a

mechanism of the ion acceleration proposed by V. I. Veksler [8], as well as with the “snow

plow” acceleration mechanism revealed in Ref. [9]. Formulated in the mid 1950’s Veksler’s

concept of the collective acceleration of ions in an electron-ion bunch moving in a strong

electromagnetic wave had a great inﬂuence both upon particle accelerator technology and

plasma physics. Up to now its direct realization was considered at moderate driving EM

radiation intensities, when transverse instabilities impede the acceleration [10]. As we show

below using 3D PIC simulations, in our scheme the transverse instabilities are supressed or

4

retarded due to the following. (i) The plasma layers become relativistic quickly, during one

or more laser wave periods, in the ﬁrst stage of the acceleration. Due to relativistic eﬀects

the transverse instabilities grow in the laboratory frame γ times slower than in the plasma

reference frame. (ii) The radiation pressure causes a stretching of the plasma mirror in the

transverse direction, so the transverse instabilities can be retarded similarly to the slowing

down of the Jeans instability in the theory of the expanding early universe [11].

III. PIC SIMULATION

In order to examine the present scheme in three-dimensional geometry, whose eﬀects

may play a crucial role in the dynamics and stability of the plasma layer under the action

of a relativistically strong laser pulse, we carried out 3D PIC simulations with the code
REMP based on the “density decomposition” scheme [12].

In the simulations the laser

pulse is linearly polarized along the z-axis; it propagates along the x-axis. Its dimensionless

amplitude is a = 316 corresponding to the peak intensity I = 1.37×1023 W/cm2×(1 µm/λ)2.

The laser pulse is almost Gaussian with FWHM size 8λ × 25λ × 25λ, it has a sharp front

starting from a = 100, its energy is EL = 10 kJ × (1 µm/λ)2. The target is a 1λ thick plasma
slab with density ne = 5.5 × 1022 cm−3 × (1 µm/λ)2, which corresponds to the Langmuir

frequency ωpe = 7ω. For λ ≃ 1 µm the laser pulse electric ﬁeld is strong enough to strip

even high-Z atoms in much shorter time than the laser wave period, thus we assume that the

plasma is fully ionized. The ions and electrons have the same absolute charge and their mass

ratio is mi/me = 1836. The simulation box size is 100λ × 72λ × 72λ corresponding to the

grid size 2500 × 1800 × 1800, so the mesh size is 0.04λ. The total number of quasi-particles

is 4.37 × 109. The boundary conditions are periodic along the y- and z-axis and absorbing

along the x-axis for both the EM radiation and the quasi-particles. Simulation results are

shown in ﬁgures 1–4, where the space and time units are the laser wavelength λ and period

2π/ω.

Figure 1 shows the ion density and x-component of the EM energy ﬂux density (the

Poynting vector). We see that the region of the foil corresponding to the size of the laser

focal spot is pushed forward. Although the plasma in the foil is overcritical, it is initially

transparent for the laser pulse due to the eﬀect of relativistic transparency (see e. g. Ref.

[13]). Therefore a portion of the laser pulse passes through the foil. Eventually it accelerates

electrons and, as a result of the charge separation, a longitudinal electric ﬁeld is induced.

This can be interpreted as a rectiﬁcation of the laser light, by the analogy with a recti-

ﬁer in electrical engineering: the transverse oscillating electric ﬁeld is transfromed into a

longitudinal quasistatic electric ﬁeld. The dimensionless amplitude of the longitudinal ﬁeld

is ak ≈ 150 corresponding to Ek = 4.8 × 1014 V/m × (1 µm/λ). The typical distance of

the charge separation is comparable with the initial thickness of the foil and is much less

than the transverse size of the region being pushed. The ion layer is accelerated by this

longitudinal ﬁeld. This stage corresponds to the ﬁrst step of the LP scheme. As the foil

moves more and more rapidly, in its proper frame the incident wavelength increases, thus

the accelerating foil becomes less transparent with time.

As seen in the cross-section of the Poynting vector in Fig. 1, the thickness of the red

stripes, corresponding to half of the radiation wave length, increases from left to right

(along the x-axis). The increase is weaker at the periphery (in the transverse direction);

correspondingly, we see distinctive phase curves. This ‘anisotropic red shift’ results from

the relativistic Doppler eﬀect when the laser pulse is reﬂected from the co-propagating

accelerating and deforming relativistic mirror. The red shift testiﬁes that the laser pulse

is expending its energy for the acceleration of the plasma mirror, as speciﬁed above in the

second stage of the LP scenario. The foil is transformed into a “cocoon” where the laser

pulse is almost conﬁned. The accelerated ions form a nearly ﬂat thin “plate” with high

density, Fig. 2.

Figure 3 shows the ion maximum energy versus time and the ion phase space plot. The

dependence is initially linear; at later times it scales as t1/3. The ion and electron energy

spectra and transverse emittances are presented in Fig. 4. The number of ions in the plate

is Ni = 2 × 1012, their energies are from 1.3 GeV to 3.2 GeV. The eﬃciency of the energy

transformation from laser to ions in this range is 10%; eﬃciency for all ions is 30%. The ion

bunch density is 3 × 1021 cm−3, its duration is 20 fs, its transverse emmittance is less than

0.1 π mm mrad. As the plate is quasineutral, the average longitudinal velocity of the electron

bulk is about that of ions, vek ≈ vik, thus the average longitudinal energy of electrons is of

the order of Eek ≃ (me/mi)Ei. Correspondingly, the energy spectrum of electrons is peaked

at much less energy than that of ions.

According to our 2D and 3D simulations at lower intensities, corresponding to Petawatt

and multi-Petawatt pulses, the interaction exhibits a continuous transition from regimes of

Refs. [1, 2, 4, 5] to the LP regime as the intesity increases.

IV.

ION MAXIMUM ENERGY AND EFFICIENCY

Here we estimate the ion maximum energy and the acceleration eﬃciency in the model of

the ﬂat foil driven by the EM radiation pressure, as described above in the LP scenario. In

general, the radiation pressure on the foil depends on its reﬂectance [14]. Assume that in the

instantaneous reference frame, where the foil is at rest, the relative amplitudes of reﬂected

and transmitted waves are ρ and τ , respectively. Here |ρ|2 + |τ |2 = 1 because of energy

EM wave momentum ﬂuxes, P = (E′2

conservation. The radiation pressure is the sum of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted
L/2π)(ω′/ω)2|ρ(ω′)|2. Here
the primed values correspond to the moving reference frame, variables without a prime are

L /4π)(1 + |ρ|2 − |τ |2) = (E2

taken in the laboratory frame. In a quasi-one-dimensional geometry, at the foil location x(t)

the laser electric ﬁeld is EL = EL(t − x(t)/c). If the foil is accelerated as a single whole, in

its reference frame the incident radiation frequency becomes smaller and smaller with time,

thus the reﬂection becomes more and more eﬃcient and |ρ(ω′)|2 becomes closer to unity.

In fact, the foil reference frame is not inertial since the foil is accelerated. Hence, the EM

wave frequency ω′ decreases with time in this frame as described in Ref. [15]. Nevertheless

we can assume that the acceleration is relatively small and thus (ω′/ω)2 = (c − v)/(c + v),

where v = dx/dt is the foil instantaneous velocity.

As is well known, the EM radiation pressure is a relativistic invariant [14], therefore we

can write the foil motion equation as

where p is the momentum of ions representing the foil. In the simplest case, when EL = const
and |ρ|2 = 1, the solution p(t) is an algebraic function of t. For the initial condition p = p0

at t = 0 it can be written in a compact form as p = mic (sinh(u) − csch(u)/4), where

u = (1/3)arcsinh (Ωt + h3

analogous to that of a charged particle driven by a radiation pressure [14], but in our case

the role of the Thomson cross-section is played by the quantity 2/nel.

To ﬁnd an upper limit of the ion energy acquired due to the interaction with a laser

pulse of ﬁnite duration, we must include the dependence of the laser EM ﬁeld on space

and time. Because of the foil motion, the interaction time can be much longer than the

laser pulse duration tL. Therefore it is convenient to consider the dynamics in terms of the

where EL is the laser pulse energy, Ni is the number of ions in the foil. The solution of Eq.

where we set p0 = 0 for simplicity. Here κ is the reﬂection coeﬃcient, taken in the co-

EL ≫ Nimic2/2, in this model almost all the energy of the laser pulse is transformed into

ion kinetic energy. Using Eq. (4) and the t1/3 asymptotic dependence of the ion energy

on time, for given simulation parameters we estimate the acceleration time and length as

tacc ≈ (2/3)(EL/Nimic2)2tL = 16 ps and xacc ≈ ctacc = 4.8 mm, respectively.

In the

presented simulations the acceleration time is limited by computer resources. However, the

analytical estimation Eq. (4) allows us to conlude that at given simulation parameters the

limiting ion kinetic energy is 30 GeV. Since the ion bunch is relativistic, another ultra-intense

laser pulse, sent with proper delay, can accelerate the bunch further.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the LP regime of ultra-intense laser-plasma interaction can be employed in

a laser-driven heavy ion collider. In the collision of two ion bunches the number of reactions
with cross-section σ is N = σN 2
i /s, where s is the bunch sectional area. Adopting the
presented simulation parameters, we obtain N ≈ 2 × 1030σ/cm2. Provided that the energy

is high enough so that σ ≈ 10−24 cm2, we can get about a million events in a few femtosecond

shot. As suggested by two of co-authors (T. T. and G. M.) in Ref. [6], one can get a short

multi-Exawatt laser pulse with suﬃcient contrast ratio (10−12) using the megajoule NIF

facility and present-day technology. Then the resulting ion bunch energy can be over 100

GeV per nucleon, which is suitable for the quark-gluon plasma studies [16]. The laser piston

regime, being one of the examples of what we call the Relativistic Engineering, can give us

a promising and unique tool for nuclear physics research.

Investigation of transfer processes in dense weakly or fully ionized many-component
gases is topical in view of construction and improvement of new gaseous lasers, plasmo-
chemical reactors for ozone synthesis, and air cleaning of both nitrogen and carbon oxides
and chlorine compounds.

A study and calculation of transfer coeﬃcients taking into account the interparticle
interaction nature is one of the major problems in this investigation. Recent papers by
Murphy [1-4] are devoted to these calculations for some special low-density mixtures bas-
ing on the Boltzmann kinetic equation for point particles and using accurate interparticle
potentials of interaction. Nevertheless, there are some problems in calculation of trans-
fer coeﬃcients for high-density mixtures. They are caused mainly by the fact that the
Boltzmann kinetic equation is suitable for rareﬁed gases and plasmas only.

The Enskog-Landau kinetic equation was obtained in [5,6] for a one-component system
of charged hard spheres in the electron compensation ﬁeld starting from the Bogolubov
hierarchy with modiﬁed boundary conditions in the pair collision approximation. In paper
[7] this equation was generalized for the case of many-component system and usually reads:

In present work a calculation of transfer coeﬃcients for many-component dense gases
for charged and non-charged hard spheres is carried out using the Enskog-Landau kinetic
equation which takes into account realistic particle sizes.

The collision integral in the right-hand part of (1) consists of several terms. Such a
structure is produced due to the additivity of the interaction potential which is modelled
for the mixture of charged hard spheres as a sum of the short-range part (hard spheres) and
the long-range one (Coulomb particles). I (0)
E are the zeroth and ﬁrst expansion
terms of the Enskog collision integral with respect to the spatial inhomogeneity [5]. IMF is
the collision integral of the kinetic mean ﬁeld theory KMFT [8,9]. It is the ﬁrst order on
the long-range interaction. The last term IL is the generalized Landau collision integral
and it is the second order on the long-range interaction.

where f (0)
is the zeroth approximation. Usually, it is chosen as the local-equilibrium

Laguerre polynomials [10].

Having the solution to the kinetic equation (1), one can calculate the stress tensor
and the heat ﬂow vector in a system. These quantities are expressed via such transport
coeﬃcients as bulk κ and shear η viscosities and thermal conductivity λ, respectively:

where σab = (σa + σb)/2, σa, σb – hard sphere diameters, gab
2 – quasiequilibrium binary
correlation function, na – particle number density, µab = mamb/(ma +mb) – reduced mass,
Aa(0), Aa(1) and Ba(0) are zeroth and ﬁrst coeﬃcients of expansion of the correction φa
on the Sonine-Laguerre polynomials.

In numerical calculations of transfer coeﬃcients (3)–(5) for some binary and ternary
mixtures of neutral and charged hard spheres we considered their temperature and concen-
tration ratio dependences. The values of hard sphere diameters were ﬁxed: σHe = 2.15˚A,
σAr = 3.405˚A, σKr = 3.67˚A, σXe = 3.924˚A. These values were borrowed from [11].

Calculating Aa(0), Aa(1) and Ba(0) we faced with the problem of divergency of the
so-called Ω-integrals at large distances. To avoid this circumstance we should change
upper limit of integration and use ﬁnite screening radius D instead of inﬁnity. This
screening radius, in contrast to the Debye formula for point-like particles, explicitly takes
into account realistic sizes of charged particles in accordance with [12]. Contact values of
the binary correlation function in expressions (3)–(5) were borrowed from [13].

Not only the transport coeﬃcients κ, η, and λ were studied. Numerical calculation for
thermal diﬀusion Dα
T and mutual diﬀusion coeﬃcients Dαβ has been performed as well.
For two- and three-component mixtures of neutral and charged hard spheres we stud-
ied their dependences on density, temperature, and concentration ratio of some mixture
components [14]. Figs. 1 and 2 show our calculations in brief.

The obtained Enskog-Landau kinetic equation for charged hard spheres turned out
to be very useful for several purposes. First of all, the collision integral of this equation
does not contain a divergency at small distances. Secondly, the normal solution and all
transport coeﬃcients have analytical structure. They can be easily used to study some

sures P = 300, 400, 500 atm., respectively. Curves are plotted in order of increasing pressure.
Though this model is not entirely suitable as a hard spheres model, because the H2-molecule
is not spherical, nonetheless obtained results give an information about the successfulness of
the application of the model for nonspherical molecules. Somewhat worse agreement is between
the theory and experimental data [15] when temperature increases. At high temperatures the
role of the attractive part of interparticle interaction potential becomes weaken in comparison
with the repulsive one. However, this behaviour can be explained by ignoring in the theory the
temperature and concentration dependence of hard sphere diameters for molecules of Ar and
H2. At the same time it is known that σ depends both on T and n. b), c) and d) – temperature
and concentration ratio dependences of shear viscosity η and thermal conductivity λ coeﬃcients
1026m−3. These calculations were
for the mixture Ar+-Kr+ at the ﬁxed total density n = 2
performed for three ﬁxed concentration ratios of the heavy component xKr+ = 0.25; 0.5; 0.75,
xKr+ = nKr+/(nAr+ + nKr+). The coeﬃcients η and λ have very similar temperature depen-
dence. But concentration ratio dependence for λ has a diﬀerent curve ﬁt. More detailed analysis
is given in [14].

speciﬁc systems. Finally, the analytical structure of transport coeﬃcients allows us to ﬁnd
fast and easily systems, which can be best described by the obtained kinetic equation,
as well as density and temperature ranges, where the agreement between the theory and
experimental data is the closest.

A very important step in this theory is to calculate a dynamical screening radius in a

system. Partially this problem has been already solved in our recent paper [16].

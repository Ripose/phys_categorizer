Neutral Plasma Oscillations at Zero Temperature

(Dated: July 30, 2013)

We use cold plasma theory to calculate the response of an ultracold neutral plasma to an applied
rf ﬁeld. The free oscillation of the system has a continuous spectrum and an associated damped
quasimode. We show that this quasimode dominates the driven response. We use this model to
simulate plasma oscillations in an expanding ultracold neutral plasma, providing insights into the
assumptions used to interpret experimental data [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 318 (2000)].

Recent experimental [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and theoretical
work [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] has studied the formation
and evolution of ultracold plasmas.
In the laboratory,
cold plasmas are created either by directly photo-ionizing
laser-cooled atoms, or by exciting the atoms to high-lying
Rydberg states that spontaneously ionize. A fraction of
the electrons escape the plasma and the resulting electric
ﬁeld drives the ion expansion. Models of the expansion
suggest that the density proﬁle in the plasma is approx-
imately Gaussian, and that it expands in a self-similar
manner. It can be expressed as

were ionized by a dye laser. The initial electron energy
(Ee/kB) ranged from a few to 1000 K, and the initial
109 cm−3. The
electron density ranged from 0.2 to 2.5
plasmas were nearly charge-neutral, and at electron en-
ergies above 70 K, the kinetic energy of the electrons al-
lowed signiﬁcant loss. The resulting net positive charge
in the cloud drove the plasma expansion.

As the plasma expanded and its density decreased, the
applied rf ﬁeld pumped energy into the plasma. The
heating was assumed to be largest where the applied rf
frequency matched the local plasma frequency. Because
of collisions in the plasma, the local heating presumably
raised the overall plasma temperature, and a small num-
ber of the more weakly-bound electrons were ejected.
The experiment measured the rate at which electrons
were ejected from the expanding plasma as a function
of time for a ﬁxed applied rf frequency. This signal was
presumed to be proportional to the rate at which the rf
ﬁeld heats the plasma, and was a measure of the weighted
time-dependent density proﬁle.

The peak of this signal was interpreted to correspond

to the “average” density of the plasma,

with v a constant. This density was experimentally de-
termined by setting the applied frequency ω equal to
the average plasma frequency, ωp, and using the rela-
q2¯n(t)/meǫ0, where q is the electron charge,
tion ¯ωp =
me is the electron mass, and ǫ0 is the permittivity of free
space. The derived density, ¯n, is time dependent. For
a diﬀerent applied rf frequency ω, the signal peaks at a
diﬀerent time. A least-squares ﬁt of ¯n(t) to Eq. (2) gives
the initial density n0 and the expansion velocity v.

In this paper, we examine the validity of the assump-
tions used in this interpretation by presenting the re-
sponse of the system predicted by cold plasma theory.

FIG. 1: Quasimode frequency, ωm (◦), and damping rate,
γm (⋄), for density proﬁles given by Eq.
(8). For p = 2,
the distribution is Gaussian. As p increases, the distribution
approaches a “top-hat,” the quasimode frequency increases,
and the quasimode damping decreases (see text).

In the experiment by Kulin et al.

[3], the applied ~E
was uniform in space and oscillating in the ˆz-direction.
Assuming that this applied ﬁeld is small, the ﬂuid equa-
tions can be linearized by assuming that the density
and the potential are of the form n(r, θ, t) = n(0)(r) +
δn(r) cos θe−iωt, where n(0)(r) is the equilibrium elec-
tron density, and φ(r, θ, t) = δφ(r) cos θe−iωt (spherical
harmonics with ℓ = 1). After some algebra to linearize
the ﬂuid Equations (3)-(5), the potential produced by the

Because this is a driven system, we ﬁrst look for nor-
mal modes. Notice, however, that with E0 = 0 and γ = 0
(undamped free response) this mode equation has a con-
tinuous spectrum, similar to the diocotron mode equation
in non-neutral plasmas[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. And, as
with the diocotron mode, this equation also has a damped
quasimode. Following Ref.
[15], Eq. (6) can be solved
along a contour in the complex r-plane to uncover this
damped quasimode. Figure 1 shows the frequency and
damping rate of this quasimode for a sequence of density
proﬁles of the form

power for a Gaussian density proﬁle, p = 2 in Eq. (8). Also
shown is the absorbed power for super-Gaussian proﬁles, with

Note that the Gaussian (p = 2) quasimode is heavily
damped and that as p becomes large (making the density
proﬁle approach a step-proﬁle) the damping rate goes to
zero and the frequency approaches ωm = ωp(0)/√3.

The quasimode dominates the free response of a sys-
tem with a continuous spectrum [20, 21]. It also strongly
inﬂuences the driven response, as can be seen in Fig. 2.
This ﬁgure shows the rate at which a plasma absorbs
power from an applied rf ﬁeld as a function of the fre-
quency of that ﬁeld. To calculate this power, we note that
the total electric ﬁeld (the applied ﬁeld plus the plasma
response) is given by

The inﬂuence of the quasimode on the absorbed power
can be seen by integrating this power density over all
space for various values of the driving frequency ω. Al-
though strongly damped, the quasimode still inﬂuences
how the plasma responds to the rf ﬁeld. Figure 2 shows
the calculated power absorbed by the plasma as a func-
tion of the applied rf frequency for a non-expanding

plasma.
In each case the peak of the absorbed power
occurs near the frequency of the quasimode. Notice that
these resonances occur at quite small values of the den-
sity, rather than in the body of the density distribu-
tion as assumed by Kulin, et al. The experiment used
ω/ωp(0) = 0.6

We now use these cold driven solutions of Eq. (6) to
simulate the plasma expansion experiment. In order to
do this, we need an expression for the electron density,
n(r, t) and the phenomenological damping rate γ. For
both of these we use the model of Robicheaux and Han-
son [11]. They simulated an expanding ultracold neutral
plasma to study three-body recombination and electron
heating. An important result of their paper is that the
n−1/3,
electron temperature scales with density as Te ∝
which makes the Coulomb logarithm (ln Λ) constant. We
use this result in our simulation of the collective response
of the plasma to an applied ﬁeld. It is likely that the phe-
nomenological damping rate, γ, is proportional to the
electron collision rate, ν. The scaled collision rate in the
n/T 3 ln Λ, which is constant in this
plasma is ν/ωp ∝
temperature scaling. For typical experimental param-
eters, this gives γ/ωp(0)
1/100. Another important
result from the work of Robicheaux and Hanson is that
most of the ions in the plasma experience an electric ﬁeld
linearly proportional to r. Given the known initial condi-
tions in the plasma, this leads directly to the result that
the plasma density is Gaussian, and that it expands in a
self-similar manner described by Eq. (1) [22].

p

≈

We simulate the plasma expansion experiment as fol-
lows. The plasma expansion velocity (v), the rf frequency
(ω) and rf amplitude (E0) are held constant. At a partic-
ular time t, we insert the density from Eq. (1) into Eq.
(6) to ﬁnd the potential δφ and the total electric ﬁeld
[Eq. (9)]. We integrate the power density [Eq. (10)] over
the spatial coordinates to get the plasma heating rate
at that time. We increment time and repeat the heating
rate calculation to generate one of the time-sweeps shown
in Fig. 3(a). Repeating these calculations for a range of
applied ﬁeld frequencies generates all of the time sweeps
shown in the ﬁgure.

We convert the time sweeps in Fig. 3(a) into aver-
age density determinations. At the peak of each time
sweep we set the applied frequency ω equal to the av-
q2¯n/meǫ0 to calculate
erage plasma frequency ¯ωp =
the average density ¯n, as was done in the experiment
[3]. With this conversion from frequency to density, the
simulated average density ¯n(t) is plotted in Fig. 3(b).
The data is ﬁt to Eq. (2) using a least-squares method
to extract the initial central density, n0, and expansion
velocity v.

The shapes of the calculated plasma heating rates
shown in Fig. 3(a) match the experimental ones from
Reference [3], and the ﬁt of ¯n(t) in Fig. 3(b) to Eq. (2) is
excellent [23]. The expansion velocity extracted from the
ﬁt exactly matches the known velocity that we put into

If the Robicheaux and Hanson
temperature scaling is correct, the plasma response to
the rf ﬁeld accurately reproduces the true asymptotic ex-
pansion velocity. However, diﬀerent temperature scalings

make the ﬁt worse. If instead of using T
n2/3, the ﬁtted velocity increases
mining γ, we use T
by roughly a factor of two, depends on γ/ωp(0), the ex-
tracted ¯n(t) does not follow Eq. (2), and the simulation
does not ﬁt the experiment.

∝

∝

The initial central density n0 extracted from the ﬁt of
¯n(t) to Eq. (2) is quite sensitive to the scaled damping
factor, γ/ωp(0). It scales approximately as e2γ/ωp(0). It
also depends on the particular temperature scaling used
in the simulation, and can vary by orders of magnitude.
For the Robicheaux and Hanson temperature scaling and
with γ/ωp(0) = 0.01, the ﬁtted central density underes-
timates the known central density in our simulation by a
factor of three.

Cold plasma theory only addresses the collective be-
havior of the system. Another eﬀect that might be
involved in the resonant behavior seen in the experi-
ment is that the electron motion in the plasma resonates
with the driving ﬁeld. Robicheaux and Hanson estimate
that in the bulk of the plasma the potential satisifes
qφ/kBT = r2/2σ2. This means that most of the particles
are in an isotropic harmonic oscillator well with natural
frequency ω0 = ωp(0)λD(0)/σ, where λD(0) is the Debye

experiment were due to particle resonance at ω = ω0 in
the expanding plasma, the experiment does not indicate
a uniform expansion [24].

≪

However, in experiments where λD(0)

σ, such as in
the present simulations, we would expect collective eﬀects
like the quasimode, to dominate over individual particle
eﬀects like a resonance at ω = ω0. But even though
collective eﬀects should dominate these plasmas, particle
resonance can play a role, as it does in the case of electron
Bernstein wave in magnetized plasmas [25]. Calculating
this eﬀect requires a kinetic theory treatment that is be-
yond the scope of this paper. But we note that even in
kinetic theory the particle resonance will not be sharp
because the well is not perfectly parabolic, causing the
orbit frequency to vary with the energy and angular mo-
mentum. Averaging this resonance over the distribution
function blurs its eﬀect and makes the resonances at ω0,
2ω0, etc. less pronounced.

It would be very helpful to have direct measurements
of the ion density distribution, such as with optical de-
tection. These measurements could provide benchmark
data against which future simulations can be compared.
Also, as mentioned previously, full kinetic simulations are
probably required to address the particle orbit problem.
Such measurements and simulations are currently under-
way in our laboratory.

In conclusion, we have used a simulation based on cold
plasma theory to calculate the response of an ultracold
n1/3, the sim-
plasma to an applied rf ﬁeld. When T
ulation accurately reproduces the experimental data of
Kulin et al. [3], providing an important consistency check
of the model of Robicheaux and Hanson [11].

∝

The model conﬁrms that the plasma response accu-
rately reproduces the asymptotic velocity of an expand-
ing plasma, and determines the initial plasma density to
within a factor of two or three. The plasma response is
dominated by the quasi-mode. Even though the mode is
strongly damped, it shifts the plasma resonance to lower
densities than otherwise expected from a local-density
approximation.

[22] In Reference [11], the density is written as n(r, t) =
Ni[β(t)/π]3/2 × exp[−β(t)r2], where Ni is the number of
ions. The function β(t) is given by Eq. (2) in that paper,
and can be solved analytically. For the given boundary
0 + v2t2), making their ex-
conditions, it is β(t) = 1/2(σ2
pression for density identical to Eq. (1) in this work.
[23] The calculated plasma heating rates shown in Fig. 3(a)
match the experimental rates when recombination can
be neglected (Ee/kBT > 70K [3, 5]). Recombination de-
pletes the low-temperature part of the electron distribu-
tion. This translates into experimentally measured heat-
ing rates that fall oﬀ more sharply than those shown in
Fig. 3(a), measured average density functions ¯n(t) that
do not match Eq. 2, and expansion velocities greater than
expected from the initial electron energy.

[24] In the asymptotic limit where σ ≈ t

kBTe/Mi, the
model of Robicheaux and Hanson predicts that the res-
onant frequency is given by ω0 =
Mi/me/t. If the res-
onances in the experiment were given by this response,
the density proﬁle would have to be either distinctly non-
Gaussian, or experience a complicated expansion in time.

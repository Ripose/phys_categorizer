(February 2, 2008)

Restricted path integral Monte Carlo simulations have been used to calculate the equilibrium
properties of deuterium for two densities: 0.674 and 0.838 gcm−3 (rs = 2.00 and 1.86) in the
temperature range of 10 000 K ≤ T ≤ 1 000 000 K. Using the calculated internal energies and
pressures we estimate the shock hugoniot and compare with recent Laser shock wave experiments.
We study ﬁnite size eﬀects and the dependence on the time step of the path integral. Further, we
compare the results obtained with a free particle nodal restriction with those from a self-consistent
variational principle, which includes interactions and bound states.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. RESTRICTED PATH INTEGRALS

Recent

experiments

shock wave

on pre-
compressed liquid deuterium [1,2] have produced an un-
expected equation of state for pressures up to 3.4 Mbar.
It was found that deuterium has a signiﬁcantly higher
compressibility than predicted by the semi-empirical
equation of state based on plasma many-body theory
and lower pressure shock data (see SESAME model [3]).
These experiments have triggered theoretical eﬀorts to
understand the state of compressed hydrogen in this
range of density and temperature, made diﬃcult be-
cause the experiments are in regime where strong cor-
relations and a signiﬁcant degree of electron degeneracy
are present. At this high density, it is problematic even
to deﬁne the basic units such as molecules, atoms, free
deuterons and electrons. Conductivity measurements [2]
as well as theoretical estimates [4,5] suggest that in the
experiment, a state of signiﬁcant but not complete met-
alization was reached.

A variety of simulation techniques and analytical mod-
els have been advanced to describe hydrogen in this par-
ticular regime. There are ab initio methods such as re-
stricted path integral Monte Carlo simulations (PIMC)
[6,7,5] and density functional theory molecular dynamics
(DFT-MD) [8,9]. Further there are models that min-
imize an approximate free energy function constructed
from known theoretical limits with respect to the chemi-
cal composition, which work very well in certain regimes.
The most widely used include [10,11,4].

We present new results from PIMC simulations. What
emerges is a relative consensus of theoretical calculations.
First, we performed a ﬁnite size and time step study us-
ing a parallelized PIMC code that allowed simulation of
systems with NP = 64 pairs of electrons and deuterons
and more importantly to decrease the time step from
τ −1 = 106 K to τ −1 = 8 · 106 K. More importantly, we
studied the eﬀect of the nodal restriction on the hugoniot.

The density matrix of a quantum system at temper-
ature kBT = 1/β can be written as a integral over all
paths Rt,

ρ(R0, Rβ; β) =

1

N !XP

(±1)P IR0→PRβ

dRt e−S[Rt].

(1)

Rt stands for the entire paths of N particles in 3 dimen-
sional space Rt = (r1t, . . . , rN t) beginning at R0 and
connecting to P Rβ. P labels the permutation of the par-
ticles. The upper sign corresponds to a system of bosons
and the lower one to fermions. For non-relativistic parti-
cles interacting with a potential V (R), the action of the
path S[Rt] is given by,

S[Rt] =Z β

One can estimate quantum mechanical expectation val-
ues using Monte Carlo simulations [12] with a ﬁnite num-
ber of imaginary time slices M corresponding to a time
step τ = β/M .

For fermionic systems the integration is complicated
due to the cancellation of positive and negative contribu-
tions to the integral, (the fermion sign problem). It can
be shown that the eﬃciency of the straightforward imple-
mentation scales like e−2βN f , where f is the free energy
diﬀerence per particle of a corresponding fermionic and
bosonic system [13]. In [14,13], it has been shown that
one can evaluate the path integral by restricting the path
to only speciﬁc positive contributions. One introduces a
reference point R∗ on the path that speciﬁes the nodes
of the density matrix, ρ(R, R∗, t) = 0. A node-avoiding
path for 0 < t ≤ β neither touches nor crosses a node:
ρ(R(t), R∗, t) 6= 0. By restricting the integral to node-
avoiding paths,

(Υ(R∗) denotes the restriction) the contributions are
positive and therefore PIMC represents, in principle, a
solution to the sign problem. The method is exact if the
exact fermionic density matrix is used for the restriction.
However, the exact density matrix is only known in a
few cases. In practice, applications have approximated
the fermionic density matrix, by a determinant of single
particle density matrices,

ρ1(r, r′, β) = (4πλβ)−3/2 exp(cid:8)−(r − r′)2/4λβ(cid:9)

This approach has been extensively applied using the free
particle nodes [13],

with λ = ¯h2/2m, including applications to dense hydro-
gen [6,7,5]. It can be shown that for temperatures larger
than the Fermi energy the interacting nodal surface ap-
proaches the free particle (FP) nodal surface. In addi-
tion, in the limit of low density, exchange eﬀects are negli-
gible, the nodal constraint has a small eﬀect on the path
and therefore its precise shape is not important. The
FP nodes also become exact in the limit of high density
when kinetic eﬀects dominate over the interaction poten-
tial. However, for the densities and temperatures under
consideration, interactions could have a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the fermionic density matrix.

(5)

To gain some quantitative estimate of the possible ef-
fect of the nodal restriction on the thermodynamic prop-
erties, it is necessary to try an alternative. In addition to
FP nodes, we used a restriction taken from a variational
density matrix (VDM) that already includes interactions
and atomic and molecular bound states.

The VDM is a variational solution of the Bloch equa-
tion. Assume a trial density matrix with parameters qi
that depend on imaginary time β and R′,

ρ(R, R′; β) = ρ(R, q1, . . . , qm) .

(6)

By minimizing the integral:

Z dR(cid:18) ∂ρ(R, R′; β)

∂β

+ H ρ(R, R′; β)(cid:19)2

= 0

,

(7)

one determines equations for the dynamics of the param-
eters in imaginary time:

2

∂~q

↔

N ˙~q = 0 where H ≡Z ρHρ dR .

(8)

The normalization matrix is:

We assume the density matrix is a Slater determinant of
single particle Gaussian functions

ρ1(r, r′, β) = (πw)−3/2 exp(cid:8)−(r − m)2/w + d(cid:9) (10)

where the variational parameters are the mean m,
squared width w and amplitude d. The diﬀerential equa-
tion for this ansatz are given in [15]. The initial condi-
tions at β −→ 0 are w = 2β, m = r′ and d = 0 in order
to regain the correct FP limit.
It follows from Eq. 7
that at low temperature, the VDM goes to the lowest
energy wave function within the variational basis. For
an isolated atom or molecule this will be a bound state,
in contrast to the delocalized state of the FP density
matrix. A further discussion of the VDM properties is
given in [15]. Note that this discussion concerns only the
nodal restriction. In performing the PIMC simulation,
the complete potential between the interacting charges is
taken into account as discussed in detail in [12].

FIG. 1. Diﬀerence in the internal energy from PIMC sim-
temperature using

ulations with VDM and FP nodes vs.
NP = 32 and τ −1 = 2 · 106K.

Simulations with VDM nodes lead to lower internal
energies than those with FP nodes as shown in Fig. 1.
Since the free energy F is the integral of the internal
energy over temperature, one can conclude that VDM
nodes yield to a smaller F and hence, are the more ap-
propriate nodal surface.

For the two densities considered here, the state of deu-
terium goes from a plasma of strongly interacting but
un-bound deuterons and electrons at high T to a regime
at low T , which is characterized by a signiﬁcant elec-
tronic degeneracy and bound states. Also at decreasing
T , one ﬁnds an increasing number of electrons involved in
long permutation cycles. Additionally for T ≤ 15 625 K,
molecular formation is observed. Comparing FP and
VDM nodes, one ﬁnds that VDM predicts a higher molec-
ular fraction and fewer permutations hinting to more lo-
calized electrons.

III. SHOCK HUGONIOT

The recent experiments measured the shock velocity,
propagating through a sample of pre-compressed liquid
deuterium characterized by an initial state, (E0, V0, p0)
with T = 19.6 K and ρ0 = 0.171 g/cm3. Assuming an
ideal planar shock front, the variables of the shocked ma-
terial (E, V , p) satisfy the hugoniot relation [16],

H = E − E0 +

1
2

(V − V0)(p + p0) = 0

.

(11)

We set E0 to its exact value of −15.886eV per atom [17]
and p0 = 0. Using the simulation results for p and E,
we calculate H(T, ρ) and then interpolate H linearly at
constant T between the two densities corresponding to
rs = 1.86 and 2 to obtain a point on the hugoniot in the
(p, ρ) plane. (Results at rs = 1.93 conﬁrm the function
is linear within the statistical errors). The PIMC data
for p, E, and the hugoniot are given in Tab. I.

FIG. 2. Comparison hugoniot function calculated with
PIMC simulations of diﬀerent accuracy: FP nodes with
NP =32 (△ for τ −1 = 106K reported in [5],  for
τ −1 = 2 · 106K, ▽ for τ −1
B = 2 · 106K) and
NP =64 (2 for τ −1 = 2·106K) as well as with VDM nodes and
NP =32 (◦ for τ −1 = 106K and • for τ −1 = 2 · 106K). Begin-
ning at high pressures, the points on each hugoniot correspond
to the following temperatures 125 000, 62 500, 31 250, 15 625,
and 10 000 K. The dashed line corresponds to a calculation
using the VDM alone.

In Fig. 2, we compare the eﬀects of diﬀerent approx-
imations made in the PIMC simulations such as time
step τ , number of pairs NP and the type of nodal re-
striction. For pressures above 3 Mbar, all these approx-
imations have a very small eﬀect. The reason is that
PIMC simulation become increasingly accurate as tem-
perature increases. The ﬁrst noticeable diﬀerence occurs
at p ≈ 2.7Mbar, which corresponds to T = 62 500 K. At
lower pressures, the diﬀerences become more and more

pronounced. We have performed simulations with free
particle nodes and NP = 32 for three diﬀerent values of
τ . Using a smaller time step makes the simulations com-
putationally more demanding and it shifts the hugoniot
curves to lower densities. These diﬀerences come mainly
from enforcing the nodal surfaces more accurately, which
seems to be more relevant than the simultaneous im-
provements in the accuracy of the action S, that is the
time step is constrained more by the Fermi statistics than
it is by the potential energy. We improved the eﬃciency
of the algorithm by using a smaller time step τF for eval-
uating the Fermi action than the time step τB used for
the potential action. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, we used
τF = τB = τ . At even lower pressures not shown in Fig.
2, all of the hugoniot curves with FP nodes turn around
and go to low densities as expected.

As a next step, we replaced the FP nodes by VDM
nodes. Those results show that the form of the nodes
has a signiﬁcant eﬀect for p below 2 Mbar. Using a
smaller τ also shifts the curve to slightly lower densities.
In the region where atoms and molecules are forming, it
is plausible that VDM nodes are more accurate than free
nodes because they can describe those states [15]. We
also show a hugoniot derived on the basis of the VDM
alone (dashed line). These results are quite reasonable
considering the approximations (Hartree-Fock) made in
that calculation. Therefore, we consider the PIMC simu-
lation with the smallest time step using VDM nodes (•)
to be our most reliable hugoniot. Going to bigger system
sizes NP = 64 and using FP nodes also shows a shift
towards lower densities.

FIG. 3. Comparison of experimental and several theoreti-

VDM nodes, τ −1 = 2 · 106 K, and 32 pairs of electrons and
deuterons.

Fig. 3 compares the Hugoniot from Laser shock wave
experiments [1,2] with PIMC simulation (VDM nodes,

τ −1 = 2 · 106 K) and several theoretical approaches:
SESAME model by Kerley [3] (thin solid line), linear
mixing model by Ross (dashed line) [4], DFT-MD by
Lenosky et al. [8] (dash-dotted line), Pad´e approxima-
tion in the chemical picture (PACH) by Ebeling et al.
[11] (dotted line), and the work by Saumon et al. [10]
(thin dash-dotted line).

The diﬀerences of the various PIMC curves in Fig. 2
are small compared to the deviation from the experimen-
tal results [1,2]. There, an increased compressibility with
a maximum value of 6 ± 1 was found while PIMC pre-
dicts 4.3 ± 0.1, only slightly higher than that given by the
SESAME model. Only for p > 2.5Mbar, does our hugo-
niot lie within experimental errorbars.
In this regime,
the deviations in the PIMC and PACH hugoniot are rel-
atively small, less than 0.05 gcm−3 in density.
In the
high pressure limit, the hugoniot goes to the FP limit
of 4-fold compression. This trend is also present in the
experimental ﬁndings. For pressures below 1 Mbar, the
PIMC hugoniot goes back lower densities and shows the
expected tendency towards the experimental values from
earlier gas gun work [18,19] and lowest data points from
[1,2]. For these low pressures, diﬀerences between PIMC
and DFT-MD are also relatively small.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We reported results from PIMC simulations and per-
formed a ﬁnite size and time step study. Special emphasis
was put on improving the fermion nodes where we pre-
sented the ﬁrst PIMC results with variational instead of
FP nodes. We ﬁnd a slightly increased compressibility
of 4.3 ± 0.1 compared to the SESAME model but we
cannot reproduce the experimental ﬁndings of values of
about 6 ± 1. Further theoretical and experimental work
will be needed to resolve this discrepancy.

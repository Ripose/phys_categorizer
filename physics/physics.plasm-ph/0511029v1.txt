A uniform magnetic ﬁeld is applied to a spherical, turbulent ﬂow of liquid sodium. An induced
magnetic dipole moment is measured which cannot be generated by the interaction of the axi-
symmetric mean ﬂow with the applied ﬁeld, indicating the presence of a turbulent electromotive
force. It is shown that the induced dipole moment should vanish for any axisymmetric laminar ﬂow.
Also observed is the production of toroidal magnetic ﬁeld from applied poloidal magnetic ﬁeld (the
ω–eﬀect). Its potential role in the production of the induced dipole is discussed.

Many stars and planets generate their own nearly–
axisymmetric magnetic ﬁelds. Understanding the mech-
anism by which these ﬁelds are generated is a problem
of fundamental importance to astrophysics. These dy-
namos are sometimes modelled using two components:
a process which generates toroidal magnetic ﬁeld from
poloidal ﬁeld and a feedback mechanism which reinforces
the poloidal ﬁeld [1]. The ﬁrst process is easily mod-
elled in an axisymmetric system:
toroidal diﬀerential
rotation of a highly–conducting ﬂuid sweeps the pre-
existing poloidal ﬁeld in the toroidal direction creating
toroidal ﬁeld. This phenomenon, known as the ω–eﬀect,
is eﬃcient at producing magnetic ﬁeld and has been ob-
served experimentally [2, 3]. The second ingredient to
the model is more enigmatic, as toroidal currents must be
generated to reinforce the original axisymmetric poloidal
ﬁeld. Cowling’s theorem [4] excludes the possibility of
an axisymmetric ﬂow generating such currents so some
symmetry–breaking mechanism is required.

The usual mechanism invoked [5] is a turbulent electro-

motive force (EMF), E =
, whereby small scale
D
ﬂuctuations in the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds break
the symmetry and interact coherently to generate the
large scale magnetic ﬁeld. This EMF is sometimes ex-
panded [6] in terms of transport coeﬃcients about the
mean magnetic ﬁeld: E = αB + β∇ × B + γ × B; α is
characterized by helicity in the turbulence, β by en-
hanced diﬀusion and γ by a gradient in the turbulent
intensity. α is of particular interest as it results in cur-
rent ﬂowing parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld, and when cou-
pled with the ω–eﬀect can generate the toroidal currents
needed to reinforce the poloidal ﬁeld.

Experimental evidence for mean–ﬁeld EMFs (such as
the α–eﬀect) in turbulent ﬂows has been scarce. Two
experiments, relying on a laminar α–eﬀect, have gener-
ated an EMF [7] and dynamo action [8], but heavily-
constrained ﬂow geometries were used to produce the
needed helicity; the role of turbulence was ambiguous.
Experiments with unconstrained ﬂows have provided ev-
idence for turbulent EMFs, though not the turbulent

α–eﬀect. Reighard and Brown [9] have attributed a
measured reduction in the conductivity of a turbulent
ﬂow of sodium to the β–eﬀect. P´etr´elis et al. have ob-
served [10] distortion of a magnetic ﬁeld similar to an
α–eﬀect (currents generated in the direction of an ap-
plied magnetic ﬁeld) and postulate that turbulence may
be responsible for disagreement between a laminar model
and observations. Not all liquid–metal experiments have
demonstrated such eﬀects: Frick et al. have reported [11]
that the mean ﬂow accounts for all magnetic ﬁelds in
their torus–shaped gallium experiment. It should also be
noted that an α–eﬀect has been observed in the core of
magnetically–conﬁned plasmas [12, 13].

In this Letter we report measurements of the magnetic
ﬁeld induced by applying an axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld
to a turbulent, axisymmetric ﬂow of liquid sodium. An
induced dipole moment is measured which cannot be gen-
erated by the mean ﬂow, indicating the presence of a
turbulent EMF.

The study is conducted in the Madison Dynamo Ex-
periment, a 1 m diameter stainless steel sphere containing
liquid sodium. As shown in Fig. 1, two drive shafts enter
the sphere through each pole and drive impellers which
generate an axisymmetric mean ﬂow. The shafts are

2

(Rm = 100) N ∼ 10−2, so the magnetic ﬁeld is not ex-
pected to alter the ﬂow. This is conﬁrmed by the linear
dependence of the induced magnetic ﬁeld with respect to
the applied ﬁeld.

The velocity ﬁeld generated by the impellers can be

expressed in cylindrical coordinates (s, φ, z) as

v = ∇Φ × ∇φ + vφ(s, z) ˆφ.

(1)

where Φ(s, z) is the poloidal stream function. The ﬂow
consists of two large cells, one in the northern and one
in the southern hemisphere. An example of this ﬂow,
measured in a water model of the sodium apparatus [14],
can be seen in the lower half of Fig. 2. The poloidal rolls
ﬂow inward at the equator and outward at the poles.
The two toroidal cells ﬂow in opposing directions. The
ﬂow is similar to the t2s2 ﬂow proposed by Dudley and
James [15], a ﬂow which is calculated to magnetically
self-excite at suﬃciently high magnetic Reynolds num-
ber, Rm = µ0σav0, where µ0 is the vacuum magnetic
permeability (this study is conducted below the critical
Rm for self-excitation, as demonstated by the lack of ob-
served growing magnetic ﬁelds). The slight asymmetry
of the ﬂow about the equator (not about the drive shaft
axis) is caused by small diﬀerences in the rotation rates of
the impellers, and can be adjusted experimentally. Tur-
bulent ﬂuctuations of the measured ﬂow can be as large
as 20% of the mean, depending on location.

Once the sphere is full of sodium the motors are started
and a constant magnetic ﬁeld is applied to the sphere.
The Hall probes sample the magnetic ﬁeld at 1 kHz for
5 minutes; the applied ﬁeld is then subtracted from
these data to determine the induced ﬁeld. Measurements
of the induced ﬁeld are presented in the upper half of
Fig. 2. The ﬁeld is represented by a toroidal component,
Bφ(s, z), and poloidal ﬂux function, Ψ(s, z), such that

B = ∇Ψ × ∇φ + Bφ(s, z) ˆφ.

(2)

The toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, undetectable by probes out-
side the sphere and orthogonal to the applied poloidal
ﬁeld,
is measured within the sphere by internal Hall
probes, conﬁrming the presence of the ω–eﬀect. The
peak amplitude of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld scales lin-
early with Rm, and can be larger than the magnitude
of the applied ﬁeld. The induced poloidal magnetic ﬁeld
is predominantly axisymmetric, consisting of a number
of diﬀerent spherical harmonic components as given in
Tab. I. The dominant components with l equal to 3 and
5 are expected; the large measured dipole component is
not expected, as it cannot be generated by the axisym-
metric mean ﬂow, as will be shown below.

The induced dipole moment ﬂuctuates dramatically in
time around a well–deﬁned mean, as seen in Fig. 3. Mea-
surements indicate that the induced dipole depends on
Rm (Fig. 4a) and upon the magnitude of the externally–
applied ﬁeld (Fig. 4b). The dipole moment’s dependence

coupled to two 75 kW motors which are independently
controlled by variable–frequency drives. Two external
coils, coaxial with the impellers, apply a nearly–uniform
magnetic ﬁeld throughout the sphere, with a magnitude
of 60 G on axis. The radial component of the magnetic
ﬁeld is measured by an array of 74 Hall probes mounted
to the sphere’s surface, allowing resolution of spherical
harmonic components of the external magnetic ﬁeld up
to a polar order of 7 and azimuthal order of 5. Magnetic
ﬁelds within the sphere are measured by 7 linear arrays
of Hall probes inserted into the sodium within stainless
steel sheaths. These probes are oriented so as to measure
either the axial or toroidal component of the ﬁeld.

The study is conducted in the kinematic regime—the
magnetic ﬁeld is not strong enough to aﬀect the ﬂow. The
strength of the Lorentz force relative to the inertial forces
acting on the ﬂuid is characterized by the interaction pa-
rameter (also called the Stuart number), N = σaB2
0/ρv0,
where a is the radius of the sphere, σ and ρ are the con-
ductivity and density of the ﬂuid, respectively, and B0
and v0 are characteristic magnetic and velocity ﬁeld mag-
nitudes. For a magnetic ﬁeld of 60 G and v0 = 15 m/s

on Rm eliminates the possibility of the measurement be-
ing a systematic error in the analysis. The EMF depends
linearly on the applied ﬁeld, indicating that it is a kine-
matic eﬀect and not due to the back reaction.

While Cowling’s theorem demonstrates that self-
it
excitation is not possible in axisymmetric systems,
is not obvious that a dipole moment cannot be induced
by an axisymmetric velocity ﬁeld exposed to an axisym-
metric magnetic ﬁeld. The proof of this is as follows.
Consider a bounded, steady–state, axisymmetric system
described by Eq. 1 and 2. The only non-trivial compo-

The limits of integration depend upon the nature of the
magnetic ﬂux surfaces. Two types of magnetic surfaces
exist: closed ﬂux surfaces and those with open ﬁeld lines
which penetrate the surface of the ﬂuid. On closed ﬂux
surfaces one integrates around the entire surface, giving
ℓ(∂Φ/∂ℓ) dℓ = 0. When ﬁeld lines pass through the

ﬂuid’s surface the condition that the ﬂuid is contained,

i.e. ∇Φ = 0 on the vessel wall, results in
a (∂Φ/∂ℓ) dℓ =

Φ(b) − Φ(a) = 0, where a and b are the points where the

It
is interesting to note that it is only the dipole moment
that vanishes; moments which include diﬀerent powers
of s in Eq. 3 are nonzero in general. This conclusion
is also independent of geometry; any simply–connected
axisymmetric system gives the same result.

It is possible that an induced dipole could be gener-
ated if mean non-axisymmetric magnetic and velocity
ﬁeld modes interacted. The stainless steel tubes which
contain the internal Hall probes could potentially break
the symmetry and create a mean non-axisymmetric ﬂow.
However, if this were the case one would expect higher–
order non-axisymmetric induced ﬁeld components, which
are not observed. The mean induced ﬁeld is axisymmetric
both with and without the tubes.

Since it cannot be generated by the mean ﬂow, the
dipole moment must be the result of turbulence breaking
the symmetry of the system, likely a turbulent EMF of
some form. Any of the terms in the mean–ﬁeld expan-
sion of the EMF have the potential to yield the observed
dipole moment. A toroidal α–eﬀect could produce large
scale toroidal currents by interacting with the observed
ω–eﬀect. The small scale helicity needed for the α–eﬀect
might come from either a turbulent cascade or be pro-
duced directly by the impellers. The β–eﬀect leads to
turbulent modiﬁcations of the ﬂuid conductivity [6]. A
nonuniform β–eﬀect could cause uneven distributions of
currents to generate the dipole moment. A third pos-
sibility is the γ–eﬀect [6], which expells magnetic ﬁeld
from regions of high turbulent intensity, resulting in dia-
magnetism. The intensity of the turbulence varies with
position, so the β–eﬀect and the γ–eﬀect are both candi-
dates to explain the ﬁeld.

Expanding the EMF in terms of the mean magnetic
ﬁeld may not be appropriate, since the largest ﬂuctu-
ations in the magnetic ﬁeld do not satisfy the scale–
separation and homogeneity requirements usually im-
posed in the expansion of the mean–ﬁeld EMF. The
largest turbulent magnetic ﬂuctuations are m = 1. Their
Gaussian probability distribution is centered at zero, con-
sistent with a passively–advected magnetic ﬁeld in a tur-
bulent cascade of velocity ﬂuctuations. These m = 1
ﬂuctuations in B could, in principle, interact with m = 1
ﬂuctuations in the ﬂow and average to give a net toroidal
current.

In summary, a dipole moment is induced in the exper-
iment which cannot be produced by the mean ﬂow. The
induced currents are of the correct form to regenerate the
poloidal magnetic ﬁeld, as required in the αω–dynamo
model [1]. This is the ﬁrst observation of this eﬀect in a
laboratory experiment. Explicit characterization of the
EMF is impossible without more detailed knowledge of
the form of the turbulence and direct measurement of
the ﬂuctuating components of v and B. Future work

4

will be directed towards identifying the characteristics
of the ﬂuctuations responsible for producing the dipole
ﬁeld. We also note that no saturation of the mechanism
has yet been observed, as might be expected from numer-
ical simulations and theory [16, 17]. Future experiments
with larger magnetic ﬁelds may provide insight into the
saturation mechanism.

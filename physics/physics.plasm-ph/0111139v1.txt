Abstract

PACS: 52.70.-m; Keywords: Plasma diagnostics, interferometry

Abel Inversion is currently used in laser-plasma studies in order to estimate the
electronic density ne from the phase-shift map δφ obtained via interferometry. The
main limitation of the Abel method is due to the assumption of axial symmetry of
In this paper we present an
the electronic density, which is often hardly fulﬁlled.
improvement to the Abel inversion technique in which the axial symmetry condition is
relaxed by means of a truncated Legendre Polinomial expansion in the azimutal angle.
With the help of simulated interferograms, we will show that the generalized Abel
inversion generates accurate densities maps when applied to non axisymmetric density
sources.

Abel Inversion is widely used in many context and, in laser-plasma studies it leads to
a 2D electronic density map ne reconstruction from phase-shift maps δφ recorded using
interferometry [1][2]. Once the phase map δφ(z, x) has been extracted from the interferogram
via standard FFT techniques [3] or with a more sophisticated Wavelet-Based method [4],
the best symmetry axis z0 should be deﬁned and two half-space phase maps

δφ+(ζ, x) = δφ(z

are introduced. By assuming axial symmetry around the laser-beam propagation axis x,
δφ+ = δφ− so the electronic density map ne(r, x) is computed as

where λp is the probe wavelength and nc = πm(c/(eλp))2 is the critical density at λp.

Though laser plasmas show approximately axial symmetry in general, signiﬁcant devi-
ations from the symmetry may occur. In these latter cases the Abel Inversion applied to
an artiﬁcial proﬁle obtained by symmetrization of either δφ+ or δφ−, can lead to mislead-
ing reconstruction of the density distribution. Alternately, to consider the ”mean” phase
distribution δφs = 1/2(δφ+ + δφ−) can also induce large errors.

In 1981 Yasutomo et al [5] presented a generalization of Abel inversion based on the
assumption that the 3D density distribution n(r, x, θ) can be factorized as the product of a
isotropic density ˜n0(r) and a corrective term g(r sin θ), being θ the azimutal angle.

In this paper we introduce a generalization of the Abel inversion algorithm to be applied
to moderately asymmetric interferograms. Unlike Yasutomo, we base our algorithm on a
Legendre polinomial expansion of n(r, x, θ) in the angular variable alone. We will show
that such an extension of the Abel method allows accurate reconstructions of the density
distribution in some simulated non symmetric cases.

The basic geometry of the phase-shift acquisition via interferometry is shown in Fig. 1,
in which a plane parallel to the laser propagation axis (x-direction), Fig. 1 a), and a plane
perpendicular to that axis, Fig. 1 b), are shown, respectively.

Let us point out that any departure from the mirror symmetry respect to the plane
z plane in Fig. 1) cannot be taken into account
perpendicular to the probe axis (the x
because of the line integral in the acquisition step. Consequently we can assume that such
a mirror symmetry is satisﬁed.

The phase-shift δφ(z, x) detected in the (z, x) position on the interferogram is then linked

to the electronic density ne(r, θ, x) as:

where we moved to the cylindrical coordinates (r, θ), taking x as symmetry axis.

We now make the physically justiﬁed assumption that the angular dependence of ne(r, θ, x)
is everywhere ”well behaved” (no abrupt changes occur) so that ne can be developed as a

ne(r, θ, x) =

To ﬁnd the appropriate value of L, let us simply observe that for each x from δφ+(ζ) and
δφ−(ζ) we can build up two linearly independent sequences

so that for each x and r we have two independent degrees of freedom which could be linked
to the angular dependence and this leads to L = 1. The truncation of the series of Eq. 0.4
up to l = 1 is straightforward. Since P0(x) = 1 and P1(x) = x, we have

n(r, θ, x) = n0(r, x) + n1(r, x) cos(θ)

and so the phase-shift map is computed as:

The application of the generalized Abel inversion (equations ( 0.5), (0.8)) is straightfor-
ward and very eﬀective. In order to prove this, the new algorithm will be tested with two
sample interferograms. Both of them have been obtained numerically from a priori known
density distributions, with which the reconstructed distributions can be compared.

Let us ﬁrstly consider the sample interferogram of Fig. 2 b), obtained from the 3D
density distribution of the form nT rue(r, θ, x) = n0(r, x) P0(cos(θ)) + n1(r, x) P1(cos(θ)) +
n2(r, x) P2(cos(θ)), with ni gaussian shaped in the radial direction r and exponentially de-
creasing in the longitudinal direction x. The simulation is performed assuming a 1µm
wavelength probe and a maximum density of ni in nc units as nmax
1 = 0.05,
nmax
2 = 0.025.

0 = 0.1, nmax

Once the phase shift δφ has been extracted from the interferogram, an automatic pro-
cedure to optimize the position of the global symmetry axis (z0) has been applied and the
two half phase maps δφ+ and δφ− have been constructed. Next, the electronic densities
n+(r, x), n−(r, x), nmean(r, x) are computed via standard Abel Inversion applied to δφ+,
δφ−, δφs = 1/2(δφ+ + δφ−), respectively. Finally, the generalized Abel inversion (Eqq. 0.5,
0.8) is applied to both δφ+ and δφ− producing ngener(r, θ, x).

In Fig. 2 projections onto the z

x plane of the simulated density (a), the standard
Abel inversion of the symmetryzed map δφs (c) and of the generalized Abel inversion of δφ+
and δφ− (d), are shown. As it is clear, nmean shape diﬀers considerably from the one of
nT rue, while nGener well match the true density map. For a more quantitative comparison,
we have reproduced in Fig. 3 b) line-outs of the projection of the true density map nT rue
and of n+ and n− at x = 10µm from the simulated target. As it is evident, not only none
of them reasonably reproduces the true density contour but their shapes also diﬀer very
much. As a result, standard Abel Inversion is not applicable in this case in order to produce
a (reasonably) accurate density map.
In Fig. 3 a) the line-outs of the projection of the
generalized Abel inversion ngener and the standard inversion of δφs are confronted with the
n0 P0 + n1 P1 (dashed line). Standard Abel
true density contour (dotted line) and n01 ≡
inversion applied to the mean phase-shift map still fails in reproducing a reasonable density
map, while generalized Abel inversion gives us a contour which is everywhere well overlapped
to the true one. Now, as a result, we can claim that with the use of the generalized Abel
Inversion a good estimation of the simulated density map is achieved.

Now, let us test the new algorithm in a physical condition which is often experimentally
observed: a density with an axially symmetric background to which it is added an axially
symmetric channel whose symmetry axis is not aligned with the one of the background (see
Fig. 4 a)). As before, the maximum electronic density is well below the critical density
nT rue

max = 0.1 nc and the probe wavelength is 1µm.

As in the previous example we apply the standard and the generalized Abel inversions to
the phase-shift maps extracted by the interferogram reproduced in Fig. 4 b). In Figg. 4 c)
and d), the best output of the standard Abel inversion (the one obtained with δφ+) and of
the generalized Abel inversion are shown, respectively. As in the previous example, standard
Abel inversion produces a poorly accurate density map. A more quantitative analysis can
be performed with the help of line-outs reported in Fig. 5, which shows that standard Abel
inversion results should be rejected. On the contrary, generalized Abel inversion produces
reasonably good results in almost all the density map but a thin band near the best symmetry

axis, where the dependence of nT rue on cos(θ) is much more complex then linear.

We face now with a noisy phase map in order to compare the noise content in the standard
and in the generalized Abel inversions. Here we will focus only on Gaussian and uncorrelated
(white) noise, which is added to the phase-shift map of the interferogram reproduced in Fig.
4 b) (see Fig. 6 (a)). To visualize the noise which is propagated to the density maps nN oise
and nN oise
(see Fig. 6 (b)), we subtract them to the density maps n0 and n1 we have
1
previously computed with the phase map of interferogram in Fig. 4 b) (in which no noise
nN oise
were introduced). The resulting error maps δn0 = n0 −
are

ﬁnally confronted. Since the isotropic component of the density map nN oise
coincides with
the standard Abel inversion of the symmetrized phase map, we can to compare the noise

To conclude, the generalized Abel inversion method we propose is very simple and eﬀec-
tive, it uses consistently the information carried by the whole phase-shift map and, as shown
in the examples, it can be successfully applied to asymmetric cases for which the standard
method based on only half-space phase shift map, fails.

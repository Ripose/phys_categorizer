The diﬀraction broadening of the intense laser radiation re-
stricts its eﬃcient use in many applications. Proposed in the
present work is a method for laser radiation guiding in a density
channel formed in plasma by a relativistic electron beam. The
conditions and parameters of the relativistic beam ensuring the
guiding by means of the proposed method have been examined.

PACS number(s): 52.40.Mj, 52.40.Nk
The progress in the technology of high-intensity lasers opens new oppor-
tunities for use of lasers in many branches of science and industry. Last
years the chirped-pulse ampliﬁcation technique [1] permitted the production
of subpicosecond laser pulses of multiterrawatt power with peak intensity
up to 1019W/cm2 [2]. With intensities as such we practically have to do
with a new interaction range of laser radiation with matter, where the role
played by the nonlinear eﬀects is often essential. At present the interac-
tions of high-power laser radiation with plasma are actively investigated in
connection with diﬀerent applications: the excitation of strong plasma wake
waves for acceleration of charged particles with acceleration rates to tens of
GeV /m [3]; generation, due to nonlinear interaction with plasma, of radia-
tion at harmonics of carrier laser frequency [4]; the “photon acceleration” [5];
X-ray sources [6] etc. Note also such application ranges of laser radiation as
the Compton scattering, laser cooling of charged particle beams, the inertial
fusion.

The diﬀraction broadening of laser radiation is one of the principal phe-
nomena (and frequently the primary phenomenon) inhibiting the eﬀective
use of the energy of laser in many applications. In vacuum, the laser spot
size rs grows with the longitudinal coordinate according to the formula
rs = r0(1 + z2/Z 2
0/λ is the Rayleigh length, r0 is
the minimum spot size at the focal point and λ is the laser wavelength. Ow-
ing to that, the intensity of radiation quickly decreases as the laser beam
propagates. For high-intensity laser pulses the value of ZR is usually of the
order of several millimeters. For instance, in the Laser Wakeﬁeld Accelerator
(LWFA) scheme the increment in the energy of electrons accelerated by the

R)1/2 , where ZR = πr2

longitudinal ﬁeld of wake wave, excited by a short laser pulse in plasma, is
limited by the value eπZREz [3], where Ez is the amplitude of accelerating
electric ﬁeld of the plasma wave, e is the charge of electron. Thus, without
optical guiding the diﬀraction limits the laser-matter interaction distance to
a few Rayleigh length.

In a medium, in particular, in plasma, if the index of refraction is max-
imum at the axis of laser beam and decreases in the radial direction to its
periphery, one can eliminate or slow down the process of diﬀraction broad-
ening of laser radiation (see review in Ref.
[7] and numerous references
therein). For the laser radiation with power P > Pc = 2c(e/re)2[ω/ωpe(r =
0)]2 ≈ 17[ω/ωpe(r = 0)]2GW , where re = e2/mec2 is the classical elec-
tron radius, ω is the frequency of laser radiation, ωpe is the plasma fre-
quency, there takes place a relativistic self-focusing. However, for short
pulses with the length l . πc /ωpe, the relativistic self-focusing proves in-
eﬃcient for prevention of diﬀraction broadening [7]. In the experiments the
plasma channel is usually formed in the gas or plasma by a laser pulse that,
in its turn, is also subject to diﬀraction. E.g., the parabolic plasma den-
sity proﬁle np = n0 + ∆nr2/r2
0 may provide the guiding of low-intensity

[a2
sian laser beam if ∆n ≥ ∆nc = 1/πrer2
0[µm] cm−3 [7].
The guiding of laser radiation in the preformed plasma density channel at
distances from several millimeters to 1-3 cm has been demonstrated by dif-
ferent groups of researchers. In the present work for formation of a plasma
channel we propose to use a long relativistic electron beam (REB). REB
may traverse, without any essential changes in parameters, the distances in
plasma that are much longer than the Rayleigh length of high-intensity laser
pulses. The main advantage of the proposed method consists, hence, in the
fact that REB can form a plasma channel with lengths much exceeding those
obtained in the experiments under survey. So, the method in question could
provide longer-term interaction of high-intensity laser radiation with plasma,
as well as with relativistic electrons.

Consider the propagation of a cylindrical electron beam with velocity
v0 = ezv0 in cold homogeneous plasma. From the Poisson equation, the
equation of motion and the continuity equation for plasma electrons (the
plasma ions are taken to be immobile due to their large mass) we have:

∂2δne
∂t2 + ω2

pe(δne + nb) = 0,

(1)

2

where δne = ne −n0, ne is the density of plasma electrons, n0 is their equilib-
rium density, nb is the density of electrons in the beam, ωpe = (4πn0e2/me)1/2
is the plasma frequency. In case of long beam with the length much exceed-
ing the plasma wavelength λp = 2πv0/ωpe, and density nb = nb(r), one can
omit the ﬁrst term in Eq. (1). Then one has

ne(r) = n0 − nb(r).

(2)

The plasma electrons are blown out of the beam and a density proﬁle (2) is
established. Though Eq. (1) was obtained for the linear case when nb ≪ n0,
the expression (2) holds true also for nb . n0. So, for a function nb(r)
decreasing as r we have a plasma electron density channel. At the same
time, the summary density of electrons is constant, ne + nb = n0 = const,
and is equal to the density of ions, and, therefore, the force acting on the ions
of plasma is zero. In this paper we shall show that in spite of the summary
density of electrons during the traversal of long electron beam through plasma
is constant, the guiding of laser radiation in this case is possible. The problem
of the formation of plasma channel and the stability of electron beam will be
discussed below.

For consideration of the problem of laser radiation guiding in the plasma
density channel with density (2), ﬁrst examine the dispersion properties of
electromagnetic (EM) waves in the channel. From the Maxwell equations
one can has for the electric ﬁeld strength of EM wave

rotrotE = ∇(∇E)−∆E = − c−2(∂2E/∂t2 + 4π∂j/∂t),

(3)

where j = −e(neve + nbvb) is the density of current, ve, vb are the velocities
of plasma electrons and beam respectively. For a linearly polarized wave,
E = exEx = exE0 exp[i(ωt − kz)], B = ey(ck/ω)Ex, where B is the vector of
magnetic induction, we obtain from (3)

(k2c2 − ω2)Ex=4πe[ne(r)∂vex/∂t + nb(r)∂vbx/∂t].

(4)

On obtaining the expression (4) we assumed that the response of plasma
channel to the propagation of the laser radiation is linear, hence the change
of ne and nb under action of EM wave is negligible (that is, nonlinear terms
vex∂ne/∂t and vbx∂nb/∂t are threw away). This takes place when a2
0 =
(eE0/mecω)2 ≪ 1 [3]. To be exact, in our case Eq.
(4) is valid if the
change in the density of plasma electrons under the action of EM wave, that

3

is proportional to a2
0, is much less than the change of density under the action
of electron beam, i. e.
0 ≪ nb/n0. The derivatives of velocities vex and
vbx in the right hand side of Eq. (4) will be obtained from the equations of
motion:

where α = nb(r)/n0.
In the absence of beam (α = 0) one has from (6)
an ordinary dispersion relation for transverse waves in cold homogeneous
plasma. The expression (6) is valid also for the case of a circularly polarized
wave, because one can write that as a superposition of two linearly polarized
waves. So, although the summary density of electrons nb + ne = const, EM
wave does not ”feel” the relativistic electron beam owing to the fact that the
relativistic mass of beam electrons is much larger than the mass of plasma
electrons, just as the ions make negligible contribution to the dispersion
relation thanks to their large mass. For this reason, instead of REB one
can use a beam of relativistic or nonrelativistic negatively charged ions. It
is noteworthy also that instead of a continuous beam one can use a long
succession of bunches, the separation between which is much less than the
plasma wavelength. EM wave can propagate both along and opposite REB.
The latter is important for such applications as Compton scattering or a
plasma-based free electron laser [8].

From Eq. (6) we have for the index of refraction N = ck/ω of EM wave

The guiding of laser radiation is possible when the condition dN/dr =
pe/2Nω2)dα/dr < 0 is observed. Consider now a parabolic proﬁle of
(ω2
the electron beam density, α = α0(1 − r2/r2
b ), r < rb, and the Gaus-
sian proﬁle of the laser radiation, a = (a0r0/rs) exp(−r2/r2
s). Then ne(r) =
ne(0) + nb(0)r2/r2
b , where ne(0) = n0 −nb(0). In this case the plasma electron
density channel produced by REB provides the laser radiation guiding when
(see Chapter VI in Ref. [7])

nb(0) > ∆nc(rbr0)2/r4
s.

(8)

For instance, when rb = rs = 2r0 and r0 = 500µm,we have nb(0) > 1.13 ×
1014cm−3, and the Rayleigh length is ZR ≈ 7.85cm for the wavelength of
laser radiation λ = 10µm.

The linear case (δne ≪ n0) considered above was when a2

0 ≪ α0 ≪ 1. At
the violation of this condition the mathematical description of the problem is
complicated, but the guiding again is possible. Moreover, one can weaken the
condition of guidance. In case when a2
0 & α0, one can weaken the condition
of guidance (8) for the long laser beam (l ≫ λp), ﬁrst, because of the fact
that the plasma electrons are blown out of the channel by the laser radiation
owing to which the eﬀect of guiding is ampliﬁed, and, second, due to the eﬀect
of relativistic self-focusing. When a2
0 ≪ 1, the condition of laser radiation
guiding in this case takes on the form (see Ref. [7]):

The large gradient of plasma density in the channel may be formed by a
dense REB when nb & n0. In this case there is formed a range close to the
beam axis, where all plasma electrons are driven out. For a thin beam ( with
the radius rb ≪ λp) such a range is formed when nb > n0, and for a broad
beam (rb ≫ λp) - when nb > n0/2, the diameter of range increasing with the
beam density [9].

Now consider the problems of plasma channel formation and the plasma
stability. To avoid the excitation of plasma wave by the leading edge of
electron beam, the density of REB at the entry into plasma should grow
rather slowly, to wit as tb ≫ ω−1
pe where tb is the rise time of beam density.
However, for applications connected with the acceleration of charged particles
the excitation of plasma wave by the electron beam may prove desirable.
During the ﬂight of REB through plasma it is subject to diﬀerent forms of

5

instability. The condition of neglect of an instability may be written in the
form δ∆t . 1, where δ is an increment of the instability and ∆t is the
time of ﬂight of electron beam through plasma; for relativistic beam ∆t ≈
l /c, where l is the length of plasma column. The most quickly developing
instability is the beam-plasma instability as a result of which a plasma wave
with wave number k ≈ ωpe/v0 is excited. The development of beam-plasma
instability leads eventually to a breakage of beam into bunches ﬂying with
the period of plasma wave. The increment of beam-plasma instability for
waves propagating along the direction of electron beam ﬂight (i.e., along z
axis) is (see, e.g., Ref. [10])

δ = (31/2/24/3)ωpe(nb/n0)1/3/γ 0.

(9)

It follows from (9) that the increment of beam-plasma instability decreases
with increasing energy of beam electrons, i.e., for suﬃciently large γ 0 one can
neglect the instability. According to (9), one can neglect the instability for

γ 0 & 1.3 × 10−6n1/2

[cm−3](nb/n0)1/3l[cm].

For n0 = 1014cm−3, nb/n0 = 0.1 and l = 50cm, one has γ 0 & 300. The devel-
opment of beam-plasma instability may be desirable for a number of appli-
cations, e.g., for generation of picosecond and femtosecond electron bunches.
In this case the wake wave excited by a short laser pulse in the plasma chan-
nel produced by the electron beam would enable one to control the beam
instability.

Consider the problem of guiding from an energetic point of view. The
energy density of REB and laser beam are respectively WREB = mec2γ 0nb
and WLas = E 2

0/8π, and for their ratio one has

The wavelength λ of modern high-intensity lasers is in order of several mi-
crometer (the value of λ ≈ 1µm is typical for a solid state laser and λ ≈ 10µm
In the case n0 = 1014cm−3, nb/n0 = 0.1, γ 0 = 300,
for the CO2 laser).
λ = 1µm, and a2
0 = 0.05 (that corresponds to the circularly polarized
laser beam intensity I ≈ 1.4 × 1017W/cm2) from expression (10) follows
κ ≈ 1.08 × 10−4. When n0 = 1016cm−3, nb/n0 = 0.1, γ 0 = 100, λ = 10µm,
and a2
0 = 0.1 (I ≈ 2.8 × 1015W/cm2) one has κ ≈ 0.18. Thus, REB allows to

It was shown above that the relativistic electron beam can form a channel
in plasma, in which the laser radiation guiding is possible. The proposed
guiding method is based on the capacity of relativistic electron beam to
traverse, without essential change in parameters, the distances in plasma
much larger than the diﬀraction length of high-intensity laser radiation. The
plasma electrons are blown out of the range occupied by REB, as a result of
which a plasma channel is formed in plasma, the density in which increases in
radial direction. It was shown that owing to large relativistic factor of REB,
its contribution to the dispersion properties of channel is negligible. The
method under consideration permits an essential increase in the interaction
time of laser radiation with plasma and electron beam and, hence, in the
eﬃciency of using the radiation energy.

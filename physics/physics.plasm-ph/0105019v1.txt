Abstract

The generation of electron surface oscillations in overdense plasmas irradiated at normal inci-

dence by an intense, s-polarized laser pulse is investigated. Two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell

simulations show a transition from a planar, electrostatic oscillation (“moving mirror”) at 2ω, with

ω the laser frequency, to a 2D electromagnetic oscillation at frequency ω and wavevector k > ω/c.

A model based on the parametric excitation of electron surface waves has been developed to explain

the basic features of the 2D oscillations. This eﬀect leads to the rippling of the plasma surface

within a few laser cycles, which might be detrimental for high harmonic generation from solid

targets and also aﬀect fast electron generation.

The interaction of sub-picosecond, high-intensity laser pulses with solid targets is of

great relevance to the generation of bright sources of energetic radiation as well as a test
bed for Fast Ignitor physics. Since for a solid target the electron density ne ≫

laser energy absorption. On the typical time scale of the hydrodynamic motion of the ions,

a planar target surface is deformed by the hole boring process, driven by the ultrastrong

radiation pressure, and, eventually, by Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, due to the strong

acceleration of the target surface. Evidence for small-scale deformations comes from the

wide spreading of the reﬂected radiation observed in experiments on high harmonic (HH)
1018 W cm−2). It is known

generation from solid targets [5, 6, 7, 8] at high intensities (

that high harmonics generation is qualitatively explained by the laser-driven motion of the

critical surface perpendicular to the surface, acting as a “moving mirror” for the incident

ﬁeld [9]. The distortion of the mirror surface may thus destroy HH collimation and pose an

ultimate limit on the eﬃciency of this mechanism for producing coherent XUV radiation.

In this Letter, we show that electron surface oscillations (ESOs) may grow much faster

than the typical time scale of ion motion, leading to an oscillatory “rippling” of the “criti-

cal” surface where ne = nc. We present the results of numerical simulations giving evidence

for the growth of ESOs, and a model based on the parametric excitation of electron sur-

face waves, which accounts for the time and spatial scales observed in the simulations with

reasonable agreement. Finally we discuss the possible role of ESOs in explaining the exper-

imental observations of surface ripples, as well as the impact of ESOs in the generation of

fast electron jets.

We use two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the dynamics

of the ESOs with proper spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, the laser cycle is

well resolved in the output of 2D ﬁelds, in order to evaluate the frequency of the ESOs.

In the simulations, the laser pulse is normally incident, s-polarized and has a wavelength

λ = 0.25µm, a uniform spatial proﬁle in the transverse (y) direction and a temporal proﬁle

which rises for three cycles and then remains constant. The plasma has immobile ions and

The plasma ﬁlls the right part of the box (x > 0) and the laser pulse impinges from the

left on the x-axis. For s-polarization, the laser electric and magnetic ﬁeld are in the z-

and y-direction, respectively. We will focus on two typical simulations (run 1 and run 2).

Introducing the dimensionless irradiance ao = 0.85(Iλ2/1018 Wµm2/cm2)1/2 in run 1 we

take ao = 1.7 and no = 5nc, while in run 2 we take ao = 0.85 and no = 3nc.

The contours of the electron density ne(x, y) in Fig. 1 for run 1 at times t = 8, 10, 12, and

14 laser cycles from the run start, show the evolution of the surface dynamics over several

laser cycles. Correspondingly, the space-time contours of ne(x, y = yi, t) at y1 = 2.0λ and

y2 = 1.875λ in Fig. 2 show the temporal behavior of the surface oscillations. Initially, the

surface oscillation is planar, i.e. uniform along y, and has a frequency 2ω, being ω = 2πc/λ

the laser frequency. It is natural to identify this 1D motion as the “moving mirror” driven

refer to them as (2D)ESOs. We note that the 2DESOs in our simulations appear to be

“standing”, i.e. not propagating along y. From Fig.2 we see that while at y1 the amplitude

To our knowledge, there are no previous models that predict surface “ripples” oscillating

at the laser frequency for normal incidence and s-polarization. In the “moving mirror” mo-

tion a superposition of ω and 2ω motions occurs only for oblique incidence and p-polarization,

3

because in such a case both the electric and magnetic forces (at ω and 2ω, respectively) have

components normal to the surface [11]. In refs.[12] grating-like surface inhomogeneities in-

duced by the magnetic force have been studied; however, they are also expected to occur

for oblique incidence only and have frequency 2ω.

We propose that the 2DESOs are generated by a parametric decay of the forced 1D

oscillation with frequency 2ω and transverse wavevector ky = 0 into two electron surface

waves (ESWs) (ω1, k1) and (ω2, k2). The matching conditions for this process immediately

give k1 =

k2 and ω1 = ω2 = ω. The two overlapping ESWs thus form a standing oscillation

with frequency ω and wavevector k = k1 =

k2.

A cold ﬂuid, non-relativistic 2D model for the growth of 2DESOs has been developed

that predicts an exponential growth of ESWs in the early phase. Here we report only a

brief description of this model while a detailed derivation will be published elsewhere [10].

Firstly, the quiver motion along z is solved and a system of 2D Maxwell-Euler equations is

obtained where the ponderomotive force is considered as given. The electron ﬂuid density

and velocity are written as ne = no(x)+ǫδn(2ω)

o(nc/ne) is a small expansion parameter. The terms at 2ω describe

the electrostatic, 1D “moving mirror” oscillation, that acts as a pump for the instability,

and is assumed to be unperturbed by the ESWs. The terms at ω are the superposition of

two ESWs:

where ˜v±k = ˜v±k(x, t) varies slowly in time. To order ǫ2, the coupling between 1D and 2D

modes may be neglected, so that one obtains the usual dispersion relation for “H” surface

waves [13] propagating along a density discontinuity:

in this limit the ESW wavelength is very small and thus one expects a strong damping by

thermal eﬀects neglected in the cold ﬂuid model.

Our results indicate that the ESO instability is a good candidate for explaining the

surface rippling observed at high intensities in experiments on HH generation, where short

wavelengths and “tailoring” of pulse (or prepulse) duration are desirable to have a density

“shelf” where ne/nc is not very large and thus the moving mirror oscillation is enhanced, At

the time of maximum pulse intensity the plasma has a ﬁnite gradient at the surface ne = nc

which is in turn steepened by the radiation pressure. Therefore, the plasma proﬁle is likely

be strongly enhanced by the moderate value of ne/nc, provided ne/nc > 2 also holds in a

has a maximum for Lc/λ

0.3, and drops for shorter values of Lc.

In “optimal” conditions for HH generation, the ESO instability can be much faster than

RT instabilities. In fact, even for accelerations of order g
regime [14], the typical RT growth rate ΓRT ≃
0.125µm, is much slower than the rise of the 2DESOs which occurs over a few fs in the

1020 cm/s2 as measured in this

simulations. Most of the experiments performed so far used longer wavelengths and thus

growth times of both mechanisms should increase accordingly. The observation that surface

rippling appears even for a pulse duration as short as 35 fs for λ = 0.8µm [7] is a strong

indication in favor of a mechanism faster than RT instabilities.

Finally, we note that the results of run 1 give an indication on the scaling of the growth

rate with intensity in the relativistic regime, not accessible to our analytical model; the

growth rate may increase strongly for relativistic intensities due to the decrease of the

eﬀective plasma frequency, producing a stronger rippling of the surface, as consistent with

the simulation results and experiments that suggest that the threshold for surface rippling

is close to the ao = 1. This conjecture needs to be conﬁrmed by further work.

The ESOs also have a substantial impact on fast electron generation. Fig. 4 shows

phase space distributions at times t = 8.5 and 13.5 laser cycles for run 1. At early times,

the momentum distribution is uniform in y, with no accelerated particles in py and most
energetic electrons having px ≃
stronger forward acceleration occurs near the maxima of the oscillation, showing that most

2mec. At later times, when the 2DESOs have grown,

oscillatory energy has been transferred to the unstable 2D modes. Correspondingly, strong

acceleration in py also occurs. We notice that the momentum distribution in px is very

regular, with only a minority of electrons “outrunning” the oscillation. This suggests that

the generation of fast electrons is correlated with the nonlinear evolution and “breaking” of

the density oscillations, when the amplitude of the latter exceeds the screening length.

One important consequence of this correlation is that surface oscillations give an “im-

6

print” on the transverse structure of the fast electron currents. These latter have a ﬁlamen-

tary structure since most fast electrons are generated near the maxima of the stationary

surface wave. The wavelength of the latter determines the ﬁlament size. Previous simula-

tions have evidenced such ﬁlamentary structure, in particular that it is generated already at

the surface [15] and that the ﬁlament size scales with the laser wavelength [16], as predicted

by our model, altough simulation parameters are quite diﬀerent. In most of these simula-

tions one may clearly observe a spatial correlation between “corrugations” at the surface

and the origin of the jets. When penetrating into the bulk such jets may either merge or

drive current ﬁlamentation instabilities [17, 18], thus producing diﬀerent spatial scales.

In conclusion, a new nonlinear mechanism for the generation of oscillating “ripples” on the

surface of intense laser-irradiated overdense plasmas has been evidenced in PIC simulations.

A model based on a new parametric instability, i.e. the excitation of two surface waves

by a 1D electrostatic pump, has been introduced which is in reasonable agreement with

numerical observations. The potentially strong impact of these oscillations on the disruption

of “moving mirrors” for high harmonics generation and the production of fast electron jets

has been discussed.

The PIC simulations were performed at the CINECA supercomputing facility (Bologna,

Italy), sponsored by the INFM supercomputing initiative.

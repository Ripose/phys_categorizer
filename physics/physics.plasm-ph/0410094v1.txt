Ion-acoustic modes propagating in unmagnetized dusty plasmas are studied by applying a generic
collisionless ﬂuid model. An Eulerian-to-Lagrangean variable transformation leads to a new system
of evolution equations, which may be combined into a single (rather complex) equation for the mean
ion density. The linear and weakly nonlinear oscillations regimes are studied and their modulational
stability is investigated. This study extends known previous results on the Lagrangian description of
electron- or ion-acoustic electrostatic plasma modes. The relevance with the description of dust-ion
acoustic waves propagating in a dusty plasma is also discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Dusty plasmas (DP) have recently attracted a great deal of attention due to a variety of new phenomena observed in
them and the novel physical mechanisms involved in their description [1, 2]. In addition to known plasma electrostatic
waves [3], e.g. ion-acoustic waves (IAW), new oscillatory modes arise in DP [1, 2], among which the dust-ion acoustic
wave (DIAW), essentially corresponding to ion-acoustic (IA) oscillations in a strong presence of dust.

The linear properties of the IAWs and DIAWs have been quite extensively studied and now appear well understood
[1]. As far as nonlinear eﬀects are concerned, various studies have pointed out the possibility of the formation of
DIAW-related localized structures, due to a mutual compensation between nonlinearity and dispersion, including
small-amplitude pulse solitons, shocks and vortices [4]. Furthermore, the propagation of nonlinearly modulated DIA
wave packets was studied in Ref. [5], in addition to the formation of localized envelope soliton–modulated waves due
to the modulational instability of the carrier waves. A very interesting known approach is the Lagrangean description
of a nonlinear wave proﬁle. In the context of electrostatic plasma waves, this formalism has been employed in studies
of electron plasma waves [6, 7, 8] and, more recently, ion-acoustic [9] and dust-acoustic [10] waves. Our aim here is
to extend previous results by applying the Lagrangean formalism to the description of nonlinear DIAWs propagating
in dusty plasmas.

II. THE MODEL

We shall consider the nonlinear propagation of dust-ion-acoustic waves in a collisionless plasma consisting of three
distinct particle species ‘α’: an inertial species of ions (denoted by ‘i’; mass mi, charge qi = +Zie; e denotes the
absolute of the electron charge), surrounded by an environment of thermalized electrons (mass me, charge
e), and
massive dust grains (mass M , charge qd = sZde, both assumed constant for simplicity); Zd denotes the charge state
1/ + 1 for negative/positive dust charge)
of dust grains; we leave the choice of dust grain charge sign s = qd/
open in the algebra. Charge neutrality is assumed at equilibrium.

By choosing appropriate physical scales, Eqs. (1)-(3) can be cast into a reduced (dimensionless) form. Let us deﬁne
the ion-acoustic speed cs = (kBTe/mi)1/2. An appropriate choice for the space and timescales, L and T = L/cs, are the
eﬀective Debye length λD = (kBTe/4πZ 2
1/2,
respectively. Alternatively, one might leave the choice of L (and thus T = L/cs) arbitrary – following an idea suggested
in Refs. [9, 10]) – which leads to the appearance of a dimensionless dispersion parameter δ = 1/(ωp,iT ) = λD/L in the
formulae. The speciﬁc choice of scale made above corresponds to δ = 1 (implied everywhere in the following, unless
otherwise stated); however, we may keep the parameter δ to ‘label’ the dispersion term in the forthcoming formulae.

The well–known DIAW dispersion relation ω2 = c2

D + 1) [5] is obtained from Eqs. (1) to (5). On the other
hand, the system (6) yields the reduced relation ω2 = k2/(δ2k2 + 1), which of course immediately recovers the former
dispersion relation upon restoring dimensions (regardless, in fact, of one’s choice of space scale L; cf. deﬁnition of
δ). However, some extra qualitative information is admittedly hidden in the latter (dimensionless) relation. Should
one consider a very long space scale L
k (unveiling the role of δ as a
characteristic dispersion control parameter). Finally, the opposite limit of short L (or inﬁnite δ) corresponds to ion
plasma oscillations (viz. ω = ωp,i = constant).

dependence in time τ , this transformation is reminiscent of the travelling wave ansatz f (x, t) = f (x

is widely used in the Sagdeev potential formalism [4, 11].

below).

In principle, our aim is to solve the system of Eqs. (12) to (15) or, by eliminating φ, Eqs. (12), (13) and (16)
for a given initial condition n(ξ, τ = 0) = n0(ξ), and then make use of the deﬁnition (9) in order to invert back to
the Eulerian arguments of the state moment variables (i.e. density, velocity etc.). However, this abstract scheme is
deﬁnitely not a trivial task to accomplish.

where ωp,i is the ion plasma frequency (deﬁned above). Despite its apparent simplicity, Eq. (18) is neither an ordinary
diﬀerential equation (ODE) – since all variables depend on both time τ and space ξ – nor a closed evolution equation
for the mean velocity u(ξ, τ ): note that the (normalized) background particle density ˆn depends on the potential φ
and on the plasma parameters; see its deﬁnition (7). The evolution of the potential φ(ξ, τ ), in turn, involves u(ξ, τ )
(via the quantity α(ξ, τ )) and the ion density n(ξ, τ ).

Eq. (18) suggests that the system performs nonlinear oscillations at a frequency ω = ωp,i ˆn1/2. Near equilibrium,
the quantity ˆn is approximately equal to unity and one plainly recovers a linear oscillation at the ion plasma frequency
ωp,i. Quite unfortunately this apparent simplicity, which might in principle enable one to solve for u(ξ, τ ) and then
and vice versa (cf. Davidson’s treatment for electron plasma oscillations in Ref. [7];
ξ, τ

also compare to Ref.
[8], setting γ = 0 therein), is absent in the general (oﬀ-equilibrium) case where the plasma
oscillations described by Eq. (18) are intrinsically nonlinear.

Since Eq. (18) is in general not a closed equation for u, unless the background density ˆn is constant (i.e. independent
of φ, as in Refs. [7, 8]), one can neither apply standard methods involved in the description of nonlinear oscillators on
Eq. (18) (cf. Ref. [8]), nor reduce the description to a study of Eqs. (18, 17) (cf. Ref. [6]), but rather has to retain
all (or rather ﬁve) of the evolution equations derived above, since ﬁve inter-dependent dynamical state variables (i.e.
n, u, E, φ and α) are involved. This procedure will be exposed in the following Section.

B. Finite amplitude nonlinear excitations

The NLSE (22) is long known to possess distinct types of localized constant proﬁle (solitary wave) solutions,
depending on the sign of the product P Q [5, 15, 16]. Remember that this equation here describes the evolution of the
wave’s envelope, so these solutions represent slowly varying localized envelope structures, conﬁning the (fast) carrier
wave. The analytic form of these excitation can be found in the literature (see e.g. in [5] for a brief review) and need
not be derived here in detail. Let us however brieﬂy summarize those results.

Following Ref.

[16], we may seek a solution of Eq. (22) in the form ψ(ζ, τ ) = ρ(Z, T ) ei Θ(ζ,τ ) + c.c., where ρ, σ
are real variables which are determined by substituting into the NLSE and separating real and imaginary parts. The
diﬀerent types of solution thus obtained are summarized in the following.

For P Q > 0 we ﬁnd the (bright) envelope soliton

which represents a localized pulse travelling at the envelope speed ue and oscillating at a frequency Ω (at rest). The
pulse width L depends on the maximum amplitude square ρ0 as L = (2P /Q)1/2/ρ0. Since the product P Q is always
positive for long wavelengths, as we saw above, this type of excitation will be rather privileged in dusty plasmas. The
bright-type envelope soliton is depicted in Fig. 1a, b.

For P Q < 0, we obtain the dark envelope soliton (hole) [16]

not depend on their velocity. It does, however, depend on the plasma parameters, e.g. here µ.

The localized envelope excitations presented above represent the slowly varying envelope which conﬁnes the (fast)
carrier space and time oscillations, viz. φ = Ψ(X, Z) cos(kξ
ωτ ) for the electric potential φ (and analogous expressions
−
for the density ni etc.; cf. (21)). The qualitative characteristics (width, amplitude) of these excitations, may be
investigated by a numerical study of the ratio P/Q
η(k; µ): recall that its sign determines the type (bright or
dark) of the excitation, while its (absolute) value determines its width for a given amplitude (and vice versa). In
Fig. 2 we have depicted the behaviour of η as a function of the wavenumber k and the parameter µ: higher values
of µ correspond to lower curves. Remember that, for any given wavenumber k, the dust concentration (expressed
η1/2/ρ.
via the value of µ) determines the soliton width L (for a given amplitude ρ; see discussion above) since L
Therefore, we see that the addition of negative dust generally (µ < 1) results to higher values of η (i.e. wider or higher
solitons), while positive dust (µ > 1) has the opposite eﬀect: it reduces the value of η (leading to narrower or shorter
solitons). In a rather general manner, bright type solitons (pulses) seem to be rather privileged, since the ratio η (or
the product P Q) of the coeﬃcients P and Q is positive in most of the k, µ plane of values. One exception seems to be
very the region of very low values of µ (typically below 0.2), which develops a negative tail of η for small k (< 0.3 kD):
thus, a very high (> 80 per cent) electron depletion results in pulse destabilization in favour of dark-type excitations
(Fig. 1c, d). Strictly speaking, η also becomes negative for very high wave number values (> 2.5 kD); nevertheless, we
neglect – for rigor – this region from the analysis, in this (long wavelength λ) ﬂuid picture (for a weak dust presence,
short λ DIAWs may be quite strongly damped; however, this result may still be interesting for a strong presence of
dust, when Landau damping is not a signiﬁcant issue [1]).

V. RELATION TO PREVIOUS WORKS: AN APPROXIMATE NONLINEAR LAGRANGEAN

By combining the Lagrangean system of Eqs. (12) to (16), one obtains the (reduced) evolution equation

Note that the ion density n has been scaled by its equilibrium value ni,0, to be distinguished from the initial condition
n0 = n(ξ, τ = 0).

Despite its complex form, the nonlinear evolution equation (27) can be solved exactly by considering diﬀerent
special cases, as regards the order of magnitude of the dispersion–related parameter δ. This treatment, based on Ref.
[9], will only be brieﬂy summarized here, for the sake of reference.

First, one may consider very short scale variations, i.e. L

1). This amounts to neglecting collective
eﬀects, so oscillatory motion within a Debye sphere is essentially decoupled from neighboring ones. By considering
w(n)

Note that if the system is initially at equilibrium, viz. n0(ξ) = ni,0, then it remains so at all times τ > 0. Now, one
may go back to Eq. (12) and solve for α(ξ, τ ), which in turn immediately provides the mean ﬂuid velocity u

via (10), and then E(ξ, τ ) and φ(ξ, τ ). Finally, the variable transformation (9) may now be inverted, immediately
providing the Eulerian position x in terms of ξ and τ . We shall not go into further details regarding this procedure,
which is essentially analogue (yet not identical) to Davidson’s treatment of electron plasma oscillations.

Quite interestingly, upon neglecting the dispersive eﬀects, i.e. setting δ = 0, Eq. (27) may be solved by separation
of variables, and thus shown to possess a nonlinear special solution in the form of a product, say n(ξ, τ ) = n1(ξ)n2(τ )
[13]. This calculation was put forward in Ref. [9] (where the study of IAW – in a single electron temperature plasma –
was argued to rely on an equation quasi-identical to Eq. (27)). However, the solution thus obtained relies on doubtful
0, which amounts to remaining close to equilibrium – cf. the last of Eqs.
physical grounds, since the assumption δ
(6), implies an inﬁnite space scale L (recall the deﬁnition of δ), contrary to the very nature of the (localized) nonlinear
excitation itself. Rather not surprisingly, this solution was shown in Ref. [9] to decay fast in time, in both Eulerian
and Lagrangean coordinates. Therefore, we shall not pursue this analysis any further.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the nonlinear propagation of dust ion acoustic waves propagating in a dusty plasma. By employing
a Lagrangean formalism, we have investigated the modulational stability of the amplitude of the propagating dust
ion acoustic oscillations and have shown that these electrostatic waves may become unstable, due to self interaction
of the carrier wave. This instability may either lead to wave collapse or to wave energy localization, in the form of
propagating localized envelope structures. We have provided an exact set of analytical expressions for these localized
excitations.

This study complements similar investigations which relied on an Eulerian formulation of the dusty plasma ﬂuid
model [5]. In fact, the Lagrangean picture provides a strongly modiﬁed nonlinear stability proﬁle for the wave ampli-
tude, with respect to the previous (Eulerian) description; this was intuitively expected, since the passing to Lagrangean

variables involves an inherently nonlinear transformation, which inevitably modiﬁes the nonlinear evolution proﬁle of
the system described. However, the general qualitative result remains in tact: the dust ion acoustic-type electrostatic
plasma waves may propagate in the form of localized envelope excitations, which are formed as a result of the mutual
balance between dispersion and nonlinearity in the plasma ﬂuid. More sophisticated descriptions, incorporating e.g.
thermal or collisional eﬀects, may be elaborated in order to reﬁne the parameter range of the problem, and may be
reported later.

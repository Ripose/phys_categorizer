Abstract. We consider the inﬂuence of dust charge ﬂuctuations on damping of the dust-ion-acoustic
waves. It is assumed that all grains have equal masses but charges are not constant in time - they
may ﬂuctuate in time. The dust charges are not really independent of the variations in the plasma
potentials. All modes will inﬂuence the charging mechanism, and feedback will lead to several
new interesting and unexpected phenomena. The charging of the grains depends on local plasma
characteristics. If the waves disturb these characteristic, then charging of the grains is affected and
the grain charge is modiﬁed, with a resulting feedback on the wave mode. In the case considered
here, when the temperature of electrons is much greater than the temperature of the ions and
the temperature of electrons is not great enough for further ionization of the ions, we show that
attenuation of the acoustic wave depends only on one phenomenological coefﬁcient

INTRODUCTION

Dusty plasma represent the most general form of space, laboratory and industrial plas-
mas. Dusty plasma are conglomerations of the ions, electrons and neutral particles.
These large particles, to be called grains, have atomic numbers Zd in the range of
104 − 106 and their mass md can be equal to 106 of the proton mass or even much more.
In the considered dusty plasmas, the size of grains is small compared with average dis-
tance between the grains. The ratio of charge to mass for a given component of plasma
determines its dynamics. We note that for dusty plasmas, ratio of electrical charges of
grains to their masses is usually much smaller than in the case of multispecies plasmas
with negative ions and hence, here comes the ﬁrst of the crucial differences between
multispecies plasmas with negative ions and dusty plasmas. If it is assumed that all
grains have equal masses and charges steady in time, therefore the dust-ion-acoustic and
dust-acoustic dispersion relations are obtained on the basis of ﬂuid [3], [4] or kinetic [5]
models. For simplicity we have assumed, that all grains have equal masses and charges,
but charges are not constant in time - they may ﬂuctuate in time. The dust charges are
not really independent of the variations in the plasma potentials. Here, even in the ﬂuid
theory, appear the crucial differences between the ordinary multispecies plasmas and
the dusty plasmas. All modes will inﬂuence the charging mechanism, and feedback will
lead to several new interesting and unexpected phenomena. The charging of the grains
depends on local plasma characteristics. If the waves disturb these characteristic, then
charging of the grains is affected and the grain charge is modiﬁed, with a resulting feed-
back on the wave mode.

FLUCTUATION OF DUST GRAINS IN DUSTY PLASMAS

We consider the parallel electrostatic modes in an unmagnetized plasma when the
temperature of electrons Te is much greater than the temperature of ions Ti: Te ≫ Ti.
In such simpliﬁed situations, ﬂuctuations in time of the number density of electrons d ne
can occur due to the grains of the dust loosing or picking up some electrons. As a result
of ﬂuctuating dust charges in dusty plasmas, many new problems can appear which are in
partly treatment by Verheest [6]. We also assume that the mass of grains with ﬂuctuating
charges may be approximated by constant values. In this case the continuity equations
for specimens of dusty plasmas can be written in the form:
¶ nd/¶ t + ¶ (ndud)/¶ x = 0,
¶ ni/¶ t + ¶ (niui)/¶ x = 0,
¶ t + ¶ (neue)/¶ x = Se.
¶ ne/

(2.1)

Due to the possible ﬂuctuations of the dust charges we can express the conservation

of charge in the dusty plasma by:

¶
¶ t

¶
¶ x

(−nee + ndqd + nie) +

(−neeue + ndqdud + nieui) = 0,

(2.2)

where qd is the charge of grain of dust. This can be rewritten with the help of the
continuity equation (2.1 - 2.3) as:

¶
¶ t
(cid:18)
On the other hand, the charge of grain of dust ﬂuctuation is given by:

qd = e Se.

qd = Ii (ni,qd) + Ie (ne, qd) ,

(2.4)

where Ii (ni, qd) and Ie (ne, qd) are the ionic and electronic charging current, respectively.
When we combine (2. 3) and (2.4), we get

In equilibrium dusty plasma, the total charging current vanishes:

eSe = ndIe (ne, qd) + ndIi (ni,qd) .

Ii0 + Ie0 = 0,

where Ii0 and Ie0 denotes the equilibrium charging current for ions and electrons, re-
spectively. Therefore we can expand (2.5) as a function of ne, qd and nd using (2.6) and
hence in linear approximation for Se vanishing at equilibrium, it is given by:

Se = −n ed ne − m ed qd,
(2.7)
where n e, m e denotes charging ﬂuctuation coefﬁcients while d ne and d qd denotes ﬂuc-
tuation electron number density and ﬂuctuation charges of grains from their equilibrium
values respectively.

DUMPING OF DUST-ION-ACUSTIC WAVE

Now we add to the continuity equation 2.1 some dispersion relations for ideal dusty
plasma, when the ﬂuctuation of the charge of the dust grain is absent. To determine
dispersion relation we used the linear response theory [7], [8].

In Fourier representation we have

qa (k, w )d na = k2c

a (k, w )f (k, w )

where d na - number density ﬂuctuation of the a

components of dusty plasma, c

a -

susceptibility. Dispersion relation for the ideal dusty plasma is given by

This equation describes the dumped dust-ion-acoustic waves including the charge
ﬂuctuation. In our approximation: Te >> Ti, w 0 >> n eand w 0 >> e
m e then the dump-
nd0
ing of dust-ion-acoustic waves is dependent on the one phenomenological parameter
n e.

CONCLUSIONS

The paper deals with a small dust charge ﬂuctuations. In the case considered here , when
the temperature of electrons is much greater than the temperature of the ions: Te >> Ti
and Te is not great enough for further ionization of the ions, we show that attenuation of
the acoustic wave depends only on one phenomenological coefﬁcient n e. The value of
this coefﬁcient depends mainly on the temperature of electrons.

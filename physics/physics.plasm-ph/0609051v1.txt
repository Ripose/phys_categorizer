On the dynamical reduction of the Vlasov equation

The elimination of a fast time scale from the Vlasov equation by Lie-transform methods is an
important step in deriving a reduced Vlasov equation such as the drift-kinetic Vlasov equation or
the gyrokinetic Vlasov equation. It is shown here that this dynamical reduction also leads to the
introduction of polarization and magnetization eﬀects in the reduced Maxwell equations, which
ensure that the reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equations possess an exact energy-momentum conservation
law.

INTRODUCTION

The asymptotic elimination of fast time scales from the
Vlasov equation presents important analytical and com-
putational advantages for its solution in complex plasma
geometries [1]. Here, fast time scales in a collisionless
plasma are either associated with particle orbital dy-
namics (e.g., the fast gyromotion of a charged particle
about a magnetic ﬁeld line) or wave-particle dynamics
(e.g., the fast oscillatory motion of a charged particle in
the presence of a high-frequency electromagnetic wave).
In the former case, the elimination of a fast orbital time
scale is often associated with the construction of an adi-
abatic (action) invariant (e.g., the magnetic moment of
a charged particle in a strong magnetic ﬁeld). Next, the
construction of a reduced Vlasov equation, from which
one or more fast time scales have been removed, can
either be obtained through an iterative solution of a
perturbatively-expanded Vlasov equation [2] or by per-
forming one or more near-identity phase-space transfor-
mations resulting from applications of Hamiltonian per-
turbation theory [3]. The present paper focuses on appli-
cations of Lie-transform Hamiltonian perturbation the-
ory.

The most general setting for carrying out Hamilto-
nian perturbation theory [4] on the Vlasov-Maxwell equa-
tions is to use an eight-dimensional extended phase space
with coordinates Z a = (z; w, t), where z denotes regular
(six-dimensional) phase-space coordinates, w denotes the
energy coordinate, and time t denotes its canonically-
conjugate coordinate. The extended Hamilton’s equa-
tions (τ denotes the Hamiltonian-orbit parameter)

dZ a
dτ

= {Z a, H} = J ab(Z)

(1)

∂H(Z)
∂Z b

,

are expressed in extended phase space in terms of an
extended Hamiltonian H(Z) ≡ H(z, t) − w, where
H(z, t) denotes the regular Hamiltonian, and the ex-
tended phase-space Lagrangian Γ ≡ Γa dZ a, which is
a diﬀerential one-form in extended phase space (summa-
tion over repeated indices is, henceforth, implied). Note

that the physical motion in extended phase space takes
place on the subspace H ≡ 0:

w = H(z, t).

(2)

The extended Poisson bracket { , } is obtained from the
extended phase-space Lagrangian Γ, ﬁrst, by construct-
ing the Lagrange matrix ω (with antisymmetric compo-
nents ωab ≡ ∂aΓb − ∂bΓa) associated with the diﬀeren-
2 ωab dZ a ∧ dZ b and, second,
tial two-form ω = dΓ = 1
by inverting the Lagrange matrix to obtain the Pois-
son matrix J ≡ ω−1 with antisymmetric components
J ab ≡ {Z a, Z b}. Hence, we obtain the extended Poisson
bracket deﬁned in terms of two arbitrary functions F and
G as {F, G} ≡ ∂aF J ab ∂bG.

The extended Vlasov equation is expressed in terms of
the extended Vlasov distribution F (Z) and the extended
Hamilton’s equations (1) as

0 =

=

dF
dτ

dZ a
dτ

∂F (Z)
∂Z a ≡ {F, H}.

(3)

In order to satisfy the physical constraint (2), the ex-
tended Vlasov distribution is required to be of the form

F (Z) ≡ c δ[w − H(z, t)] f (z, t),

(4)

where f (z, t) denotes the time-dependent Vlasov distri-
bution on regular phase space. By integrating the ex-
tended Vlasov equation (3) over the energy coordinate
w (and using dτ = dt), we obtain the regular Vlasov
equation

0 =

≡

+ {f, H}.

(5)

df
dt

∂f
∂t

Note that we use the same symbol { , } for the Pois-
son bracket on regular phase space in Eq. (5) since w-
derivatives appearing in the extended Poisson bracket
vanish identically on regular phase space.

Next, the extended Vlasov equation (3) is coupled with
Maxwell’s equations for the self-consistent electromag-
netic ﬁelds

and magnetic ﬁelds E ≡ − ∇Φ − c−1∂A/∂t and B ≡
∇ × A satisfy

∇ · B = 0 and ∇ × E + c−1 ∂B/∂t = 0.

(8)

The purpose of this paper is to show that: the asymptotic
elimination of a fast time scale from the Vlasov equa-
tion (3) introduces polarization and magnetization eﬀects
into the Maxwell equations (6); and the reduced Vlasov-
Maxwell equations possess exact conservation laws that
can be derived from a variational principle by Noether
method.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Sec. II, we present a brief summary of the Lie-transform
perturbation method used in the asymptotic elimination
of a fast time scale from the Vlasov equation and its asso-
ciated Hamiltonian dynamics. In Sec. III, we present the
reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equations introduced by the dy-
namical reduction associated with a near-identity phase-
space transformation. Through the use of the push-
forward representation of particle ﬂuid moments, we
present expressions for the charge-current densities in-
volving momentum-space moments of the reduced Vlasov
distribution and present explicit expressions for the re-
duced polarization charge-current densities and the di-
vergenceless reduced magnetization current density. In
Sec. IV, we present the variational derivation of the re-
duced Vlasov-Maxwell equations and derive, through the
Noether method, the exact reduced energy-momentum
conservation laws (explicit proofs are presented in Ap-
pendix A). Lastly, in Sec. V, we summarize the work
present here and brieﬂy discuss applications.

II. DYNAMICAL REDUCTION BY
NEAR-IDENTITY PHASE-SPACE
TRANSFORMATION

A. Near-identity Phase-space Transformation

The process by which a fast time scale is removed from
Hamilton’s equations (1) involves a near-identity trans-
formation Tǫ : Z → Z(Z; ǫ) ≡ TǫZ on extended particle
phase space, where

In Eqs. (9)-(10), the dimensionless ordering parameter
ǫ ≪ 1 is deﬁned as the ratio of the fast time scale over a
slow time scale of interest, and the nth-order generating
vector ﬁeld Gn is chosen to remove the fast time scale
at order ǫn from the perturbed Hamiltonian dynamics.
Examples of asymptotic elimination of fast time scales
by Lie-transform perturbation method include guiding-
center Hamiltonian theory [5, 6], gyrocenter Hamiltonian
theory [7], and oscillation-center Hamiltonian theory [8].

B. Pull-back and Push-forward Operators

Next, we deﬁne the pull-back operator on scalar ﬁelds

induced by the near-identity transformation (9):

Tǫ : F → F ≡ TǫF ,

(11)

i.e., the pull-back operator Tǫ transforms a scalar ﬁeld F
on the phase space with coordinates Z into a scalar ﬁeld
F on the phase space with coordinates Z:

F (Z) = TǫF (Z) = F (TǫZ) = F(Z).

Using the inverse transformation (10), we also deﬁne the
push-forward operator:

T−1
ǫ

: F → F ≡ T−1

ǫ F ,

(12)

i.e., the push-forward operator T−1
transforms a scalar
ﬁeld F on the phase space with coordinates Z into a
scalar ﬁeld F on the phase space with coordinates Z:

ǫ

F (Z) = T−1

ǫ F (Z) = F (T −1

ǫ Z) = F (Z).

Note that both induced transformations (11) and (12)
satisfy the scalar-invariance property F (Z) = F (Z).

ǫ ≡ exp(±

In Lie-transform perturbation theory [3], the pull-back
and push-forward operators (11) and (12) are expressed
as Lie transforms: T±1
n=1 ǫn £n) deﬁned in
terms of the Lie derivative £n generated by the nth-order
vector ﬁeld Gn, which appear in the nth-order terms
found in the near-identities (9) and (10). A Lie derivative
is a special diﬀerential operator that preserves the tenso-
rial nature of the object it operates on [9]. For example,
the Lie derivative £n of the scalar ﬁeld H is deﬁned as
the scalar ﬁeld £nH ≡ Ga
n ∂aH, while the Lie derivative
£n of a one-form Γ ≡ Γa dZ a is deﬁned as the one-form

P

£nΓ ≡ Ga

n ωab dZ b + d(Ga

n Γa),

where ωab ≡ ∂aΓb − ∂bΓa are the components of the two-
form ω ≡ dΓ.

The pull-back and push-forward operators (11)-(12)
can now be used to transform an arbitrary operator

3

C : F (Z) → C[F ](Z) acting on the extended Vlasov dis-
tribution function F . First, since C[F ](Z) is a scalar
ﬁeld, it transforms to T−1
ǫ {C[F ]}(Z) with the help of the
push-forward operator (12). Next, we replace the ex-
tended Vlasov distribution function F with its pull-back
representation F = TǫF and, thus, we deﬁne the trans-
formed operator

Cǫ[F ] ≡ T−1

ǫ (C[TǫF ]).

(13)

By applying the induced transformation (13) on the ex-
tended Vlasov operator d/dτ deﬁned in Eq. (3), we obtain

III. REDUCED VLASOV-MAXWELL
EQUATIONS

A. Reduced Vlasov Equation

The Poisson-bracket transformation { , } → { , }ǫ can
also be performed through the transformation of the ex-
tended phase-space Lagrangian, Γǫ ≡ T−1

pressed as [3]

The new extended phase-space coordinates are chosen
(i.e., the generating vector ﬁeld Gn and the scalar ﬁeld Sn

analysis) so that dǫZ

where f (z, t) denotes the time-dependent reduced Vlasov
distribution on the new reduced phase space. Hence, we
see that the pull-back and push-forward operators play
a fundamental role in the transformation of the Vlasov
equation to the reduced Vlasov equation.

B. Reduced Maxwell Equations

We now investigate how the pull-back and push-
forward operators (11) and (12) are used in the transfor-
mation of Maxwell’s equations (6). The charge-current
densities (7) can be expressed in terms of the general ex-
pression (where time dependence is omitted for clarity)

where the delta function δ3(x − r) means that only parti-
cles whose positions x coincide with the ﬁeld position
r contribute to the moment J µ(r). By applying the
extended (time-dependent) phase-space transformation
Tǫ : Z → Z (where time t itself is unaﬀected) on the
right side of Eq. (20), we obtain the push-forward repre-
sentation for J µ:

The push-forward representation for

the charge-

tions. Hence, the microscopic Maxwell’s equations (6)
are transformed into the macroscopic (reduced) Maxwell

ticle species)

πǫ ≡ e ρǫ

(29)

is associated with the fast-time-averaged charge separa-
tion induced by the near-identity phase-space transfor-
mation.

Secondly, we derive the push-forward expression for the

particle polarization velocity dǫρǫ/dt, which is nonvan-
ishing under certain conditions, represents additional re-
duced dynamical eﬀects (e.g., the standard polarization
drift in guiding-center theory [11, 12]) not included in
dǫx/dt. Hence, the push-forward expression (21) for the

A. Reduced Variational Principle

We now show that the reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equa-
tions (18) and (23)-(24) can be derived from a varia-
d4x δL = 0. Variational principles
tional principle
for reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equations have been pre-
sented previously by Pﬁrsch [13] and Pﬁrsch and Mor-
rison [14] using the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation and by
Similon [15] using the Low-Lagrangian formalism. Here,
we present a variational principle for reduced Vlasov-
Maxwell equations based on the reduced Lagrangian den-
sity [16]

L ≡

−

X Z

d4p F H,

(36)

where F and H denote the reduced extended Vlasov dis-
tribution and the reduced extended Hamiltonian, respec-
tively. Here, we use the convenient space-time metric
gµν = diag (−1, 1, 1, 1), so that the electromagnetic ﬁeld
tensor Fµν ≡ ∂µAν −∂νAµ is deﬁned in terms of the four-
potential Aµ = (− Φ, A) and, thus, Fi0 = Ei and Fij =
ǫijk Bk.
In order to simplify our presentation, we use
canonical four-momentum coordinates pµ = (−w/c, p),
so that the reduced extended Hamiltonian H is required
to be invariant under the gauge transformation

Aµ → Aµ + ∂µχ and pµ → pµ + (e/c) ∂µχ, (37)

where χ denotes the electromagnetic gauge ﬁeld.

Note that, as a result of the dynamical reduction of
the Vlasov equation, the reduced Hamiltonian H is not
only a function of the four-potential Aµ but also of the
ﬁeld tensor Fµν . From these dependences, we express the
reduced four-current density (25) as

B. Reduced Energy-momentum Conservation Laws

We now derive the energy-momentum conservation law
from the reduced Noether equation δL ≡ ∂µJ
associ-
ated with space-time translations generated by δxσ ≡
(c δt, δx), where the variations (S, δAν , δL) are

Here, we note that δxν ≡ {xν, S}ǫ, while the variations
δAν and δL are expressed in terms of the Lie derivative
£δx generated by δxν as δAν dxν ≡ − £δx(Aν dxν) and
δL d8Z ≡ − £δx(L d8Z).

After some cancellations introduced through the use
of the reduced Maxwell equations (43), we obtain the
reduced energy-momentum conservation law ∂µT µν ≡ 0,
where the reduced energy-momentum tensor is deﬁned as

Here, the antisymmetric tensor K µσ, deﬁned in Eq. (39),
represents the eﬀects of reduced polarization and mag-
netization. Note that, while the last two terms are in-
dividually gauge-dependent, their sum is invariant under
the gauge transformation (37). Explicit proofs of energy-
momentum conservation for the reduced Vlasov-Maxwell
equations based on the reduced energy-momentum ten-
sor (46) are presented in Appendix A. Lastly, addi-
tional angular-momentum conservation laws can be de-
rived from the reduced Noether equation δL = ∂µJ
by
considering invariance of the reduced Lagrangian density
L with respect to arbitrary rotations in space.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper, the general theory for the reduced
Vlasov-Maxwell equations was presented based on the
asymptotic elimination of
fast time scales by Lie-
transform Hamiltonian perturbation method. This dy-
namical reduction is based on a near-identity transfor-
mation on extended phase space, which induces transfor-
mations on the Vlasov distribution and the Vlasov op-
erator, as well as introducing a natural (push-forward)
representation of charge-current densities in terms of re-
duced charge-current densities and their associated re-
duced polarization and magnetization eﬀects. The varia-
tional formulation of the reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equa-
tions allows the derivation of exact energy-momentum
conservation laws by Noether method.

The Table shown below summarizes the polarization
and magnetization eﬀects observed in reduced Vlasov-
Maxwell equations that have important applications in
plasma physics.

First, in guiding-center Hamiltonian theory [5, 6, 17]
for a strongly magnetized plasma in the presence of a

background electric ﬁeld E ≡ − ∇Φ, the fast time scale
is associated with the rapid gyromotion of a charged par-

ticle about a magnetic ﬁeld line and fast-time-averaging
is carried out by averaging with respect to the gyroan-
gle. The fast-time-averaged reduced electric-dipole mo-
ment πgc ≡ e ρgc includes eﬀects due to the background
electric ﬁeld as well as the magnetic (∇B and curvature)
drifts. The fast-time-averaged particle polarization ve-
locity dgcρgc/dt includes the standard polarization drift
velocity (c/BΩ) ∂E⊥/∂t, which is not included in the
guiding-center drift velocity dgcx/dt ≡ vgc. On the other
hand, the reduced magnetic-dipole moment yields the
b (where
classical parallel magnetization term µgc ≡ − µ
µ denotes the guiding-center magnetic-moment adiabatic
b ≡ B/B denotes the unit vector along
invariant and
a magnetic-ﬁeld line), which enables the reconciliation
of the particle current J with the guiding-center current
Jgc through the relation J ≡ Jgc + Jmag (valid in a static
magnetized plasma).

Next, gyrocenter Hamiltonian theory [7] describes
the reduced (gyroangle-independent) perturbed guiding-
center Hamiltonian dynamics associated with low-
frequency, electric and magnetic ﬂuctuations (ǫ E1, ǫ B1)
in a strongly-magnetized plasma (with static magnetic
b0 and E0 ≡ 0). Note that the re-
ﬁeld B0 ≡ B0
sults shown here are valid only in the limit of zero
Larmor radius [7]. The reduced electric-dipole mo-
ment includes not only the perturbed polarization-drift
b0/B0 × uE1), but also the eﬀects due to
term (mc
b0 × B1/B0) and the inductive
magnetic ﬂutter (cpk
b
part of the perturbed E × B velocity (i.e., the polar-
ization drift velocity includes the higher-order correc-
b0/B0 to the perturbed E × B veloc-
tion −∂tA1 ×
b0/B0). On the other hand, the reduced
ity −∇Φ1 × c

magnetic-dipole moment includes a correction to the clas-

sical parallel magnetization term due to the perturbed
b0 + ǫ B1/B0), where µ now

variant.

Lastly, oscillation-center Hamiltonian theory [8] de-
scribes the reduced dynamics of charged particles inter-
acting with a high-frequency electromagnetic wave in a
weakly-inhomogeneous plasma for which the eikonal ap-
proximation is valid. The eikonal representation for the
wave ﬁelds is (E1, B1) ≡ (
0 Θ) + c.c.,
where ǫ0 ≪ 1 denotes the eikonal small parameter
e
while the eikonal phase Θ(ǫ0r, ǫ0t) is used to deﬁne
ω ≡ −ǫ−1
0 ∂tΘ and k ≡ ǫ−1
0 ∇Θ, with ω′ ≡ ω − k · v
denoting the Doppler-shifted wave frequency. Note that
fast-time-averaging, here, is carried out by averaging with
respect to the eikonal phase Θ. By considering the sim-
plest case of an unmagnetized plasma [8], the ﬁrst-order
term for the displacement ρǫ = ǫ ξ + · · · has the eikonal
amplitude

Note that both reduced oscillation-center electric-dipole
and magnetic-dipole moments are quadratic functions of
the wave ﬁelds. An additional wave-action conservation
law results from the invariance of the reduced Lagrangian
density on the eikonal phase but its derivation is outside
the scope of this work.

APPENDIX A: EXPLICIT PROOFS OF

In this Appendix, we present explicit proofs of energy-
momentum conservation based on the reduced energy-
momentum stress tensor (46). We begin with the reduced
energy conservation law ∂E/∂t + ∇ · S = 0, where the

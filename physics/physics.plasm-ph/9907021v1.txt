In this paper we present a two-dimensional numerical simulation of a reconnection current layer
in incompressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics with uniform resistivity in the limit of very large
Lundquist numbers. We use realistic boundary conditions derived consistently from the outside
magnetic ﬁeld, and we also take into account the eﬀect of the backpressure from ﬂow into the
the separatrix region. We ﬁnd that within a few Alfv´en times the system reaches a steady state
consistent with the Sweet–Parker model, even if the initial state is Petschek-like.

Magnetic reconnection is of great interest in many
space and laboratory plasmas [1,2], and has been studied
extensively for more than four decades. The most im-
portant question is that of the reconnection rate. The
process of magnetic reconnection, is so complex, how-
ever, that this question is still not completely resolved,
even within the simplest possible canonical model: two-
dimensional (2D) incompressible resistive magnetohydro-
dynamics (MHD) with uniform resistivity η in the limit of
S
(where S = VAL/η is the global Lundquist num-
ber, L being the half-length of the reconnection layer).
Historically, there were two drastically diﬀerent estimates
for the reconnection rate: the Sweet–Parker model [3,4]
S−1/2),
gave a rather slow reconnection rate (ESP
while the Petschek [5] model gave any reconnection rate
in the range from ESP up to the fast maximum Petschek
1/ log S. Up until the present it was still
rate EPetschek
unclear whether Petschek-like reconnection faster than
Sweet–Parker reconnection is possible. Biskamp’s simu-
lations [11] are very persuasive that, in resistive MHD,
the rate is generally that of Sweet–Parker. Still, his sim-
ulations are for S in the range of a few thousand, and
his boundary conditions are somewhat tailored to the re-
connection rate he desires, the strength of the ﬁeld and
the length of layer adjusting to yield the Sweet–Parker
rate. Thus, a more systematic boundary layer analysis is
desirable to really settle the question.

We believe that the methods developed in the present
paper are rather universal and can be applied to a very
broad class of reconnecting systems. However, for deﬁ-
niteness and clarity we keep in mind a particular global
geometry presented in Fig. 1 (although we do not use
it explicitly in our present analysis). This Figure shows
the situation somewhere in the middle of the process of
merging of two plasma cylinders. Regions I and II are
ideal MHD regions: regions I represent unreconnected
ﬂux, and region II represents reconnected ﬂux. The two

regions I are separated by the very narrow reconnection
current layer. Plasma from regions I enters the recon-
nection layer and gets accelerated along the layer, ﬁnally
entering the separatrix region between regions I and II. In
general, both the reconnection layer and the separatrix
region require resistive treatment.

In the limit S

the reconnection rate is slow com-
pared with the Alfv´en time τA = L/VA. Then one can
break the whole problem into the global problem and
the local problem [6]. The solution of the global problem
is represented by a sequence of magnetostatic equilibria,
while the solution of the local problem (concerning the
narrow resistive reconnection layer and the separatrix re-
gion) determines the reconnection rate. The role of the
global problem is to give the general geometry of the re-
connecting system, the position and the length of the re-
connection layer and of the separatrix, and the boundary
conditions for the local problem. These boundary con-

ditions are expressed in terms of the outside magnetic
ﬁeld By,0(y), where y is the direction along the layer.
In particular, By,0(y) provides the characteristic global
scales: the half-length of the layer L, deﬁned as the point
where By,0(y) has minimum, and the global Alfv´en speed,
deﬁned as VA = By,0(0)/√4πρ.

In the present paper we study the local problem using
the boundary conditions provided by our previous anal-
ysis of the global problem [7]. Our main goal is to de-
termine the internal structure of a steady state reconnec-
tion current layer (i.e., to ﬁnd the 2D proﬁles of plasma
velocity and magnetic ﬁeld), and the reconnection rate
represented by the (uniform) electric ﬁeld E. We as-
sume incompressible resistive MHD with uniform resis-
tivity. Perfect mirror symmetry is assumed with respect
to both the x and y axes (see Fig. 2).

Now we take the crucial step in our analysis. We
note that the reconnection problem is fundamentally a
boundary layer problem, with S−1 being the small pa-
rameter. This allows us to perform a rescaling proce-
dure [8] inside the reconnection layer, to make rescaled
resistivity equal to unity. We rescale distances and
ﬁelds in the y-direction by the corresponding global val-
ues (L, B0,y(0), and VA), while rescaling distances and
ﬁelds in the x-direction by the corresponding local val-

We believe that this rescaling procedure captures all
the important dynamical features of the reconnection
process.

The problem is essentially two-dimensional, and re-
quires a numerical approach. Therefore, we developed a
numerical code for the main reconnection layer, supple-
mented by another code for the separatrix region. The
solution in the separatrix region is needed to provide the
downstream boundary conditions for the main layer (see
below).

The steady state was achieved by following the true
time evolution of the system starting with initial condi-
tions discussed below. The time evolution was governed
by two dynamical equations:

(Small artiﬁcial resistivity ηy and viscosity νy were
added for numerical stability.) The natural unit of time
is the Alfv´en time τA = L/VA. The magnetic ﬂux func-
tion Ψ is related to B via Bx =
Ψy, and By = Ψx.
At each time step, vx was obtained by integrating the
x
incompressibility condition: vx(x, y) =
0 (∂vy/∂y)dx.
Note that this means that we do not prescribe the incom-
ing velocity, and hence the reconnection rate: the system
itself determines how fast it wants to reconnect.

We used the ﬁnite diﬀerence method with centered
derivatives in x and y (second order accuracy). The time
derivatives were one-sided. The numerical scheme was
explicit in the y direction. In the x direction the resis-
tive term ∂2Ψ/∂x2 was treated implicitly, while all other
terms were treated explicitly. Calculations were carried
out on a rectangular uniform grid. We considered only
one quadrant because of symmetry (see Fig. 2). More
details can be found in Ref. [9].

In the last equation (representing the equation of mo-

The boundary conditions on the lower and left bound-

sistent with the global analysis of our previous paper [7].
The boundary conditions on the right (downstream)
boundary cannot be given in a simple closed form. In-
stead, they require matching with the solution in the
separatrix region, which itself is just as complicated as
the main layer. Therefore, we have developed a sup-
plemental numerical procedure for the separatrix region.
Noticing that in the separatrix region the resistive term
should not qualitatively change the solution, we adopt
a simpliﬁed ideal-MHD model for the separatrix. This
model is expected to give a qualitatively correct picture
of the dynamical inﬂuence of the separatrix region on
the main layer, and thus a suﬃciently reasonable down-
stream boundary conditions for the main layer. In par-
ticular, our model includes the eﬀects of the backpressure
that the separatrix exerts on the main layer.

The advantages of our approach are: (i) use of the
rescaled equations takes us directly into the realm of
; (ii) we do not prescribe the incoming veloc-
S
ity vx(xlim, y) as a boundary condition: vx is determined
not by the x-component of the equation of motion, but
rather by vy via the incompressibility condition. As a re-
sult, we do not prescribe the reconnection rate; (iii) the
use of true time evolution guarantees that the achieved
steady state is two-dimensionally stable; (iv) we have a
realistic variation of the outside magnetic ﬁeld along the
layer, with the endpoint L of the layer clearly deﬁned as
the point where B0,y(y) has minimum (see Ref. [7]).

Let us now discuss the results of our simulations. We
ﬁnd that, after a period of a few Alfv´en times, the sys-
tem reaches a Sweet–Parker-like steady state, indepen-
dent of the initial conﬁguration. In particular, when we
start with a Petschek-like initial conditions (see Fig. 3a),
the high velocity ﬂow rapidly sweeps away the trans-
verse magnetic ﬁeld Bx (see Fig. 4). This is important,
because, for a Petschek-like conﬁguration to exist, the
transverse component of the magnetic ﬁeld on the mid-
plane, Bx(0, y), must be large enough to be able to sus-
tain the Petschek shocks in the ﬁeld reversal region. For
this to happen, Bx(0, y) has to rise rapidly with y in-
side a very short diﬀusion region, y < y∗
L (in the
case Einit = 2ESP, presented in Fig. 3a, y∗ = L/4), to
reach a certain large value (Bx = 2 for Einit = 2ESP) for
y∗ < y < L. While the transverse magnetic ﬂux is being
swept away by the plasma ﬂow, it is being regenerated by
the merging of the By ﬁeld, but only at a certain rate and
only on a global scale in the y-direction, related to the
nonuniformity of the outside magnetic ﬁeld By,0(y), as
discussed by Kulsrud [1]. As a result, the initial Petschek-
like structure is destroyed, and the inﬂow of the magnetic

ﬂux through the upper boundary drops in a fraction of
one Alfv´en time. Then, after a transient period, the sys-
tem reaches a steady state consistent with the Sweet–
Parker model.

connecting system wanted to evolve towards Petschek’s
fast reconnection, it would then try to develop some new
characteristic structures, e.g. Petschek-like shocks, which
we would be able to see. Note that, if Petschek is cor-
rect, then there should be a range of reconnection rates
including those equal to any ﬁnite factor greater than
one times the Sweet–Parker rate ESP. However, in our
simulations we have demonstrated that there is only one
stable solution and that it corresponds to E = ESP. In
this sense we have demonstrated that Petschek must be
wrong since reconnection can not even go a factor of two
faster than Sweet–Parker, let alone almost the entire fac-
tor of √S. There seems no alternative to the conclusion
that fast reconnection is impossible.

It is interesting that in Petschek’s original paper the
length of the central diﬀusion region y∗ is an unde-

stead by balancing the generation of the transverse ﬁeld
Bx against its loss by the Alfv´enic ﬂow (it should be re-
marked that Petschek did not discuss the origin of this
transverse ﬁeld in his paper). As we discussed above,
this balance yields y∗
L, with the resulting unique rate
equal to that of Sweet–Parker. This results are borne out
by our time dependent numerical simulations.

The ﬁnal steady state solution is represented in Fig. 3b.
It corresponds to xlim = 5.0, ylim = 1.0, ηy = νy = 0.01.
We see that the solution is consistent with the Sweet–
Parker picture of reconnection layer: the plasma param-
eters change on the scale of order δ0 in the x direction and
on a global scale L in the y-direction. The reconnection
rate in the steady state is surprisingly close to the typical

near y = 0, contrary to the cubic behavior predicted by
Priest–Cowley [10]. This is due to the viscous boundary
layer near the midplane x = 0 and the resulting nonana-
lytic behavior in the limit of zero viscosity, as explained
in Ref. [8]. Third, there is a sharp change in Bx and j
near the downstream boundary y = ylim = 1, due to the
fact that in the separatrix region we neglect the resistive
term (which is in fact ﬁnite).

∼

It appears that the destruction of the initially-set-
up Petschek-like conﬁguration and its conversion into a
Sweet-Parker layer happens so fast that it is determined
by the dynamics in the main layer itself and by its inter-
action with the upstream boundary conditions (scale of
nonuniformity of B0,y), as outlined above. Therefore, the
fact that our model for the separatrix does not describe
ﬂow in the separatrix completely accurately seems to be
unimportant. However, for the solution of the problem
to be really complete, a better job has to be done in de-
scribing the separatrix dynamics, and, particularly, the
dynamics in the very near vicinity of the endpoint of the
reconnection layer. A proper consideration of the end-
point can not be done in our rescaled variables, and a
further rescaling of variables and matching is needed.

To summarize, in this paper we present a deﬁnite so-
lution to a particular clear-cut, mathematically consis-
tent problem concerning the internal structure of the
reconnection layer within the canonical framework (in-
compressible 2D MHD with uniform resistivity) with the

outside ﬁeld B0,y(y) varying on the global scale along the
layer. Petschek-like solutions are found to be unstable,
and the system quickly evolves from them to the unique
stable solution corresponding to the Sweet–Parker layer.
The reconnection rate is equal to the (rather slow) Sweet–
1/√S. This main result
Parker reconnection rate, ESP
is consistent with the results of simulations by Biskamp
[11] and also with the experimental results in the MRX
experiment [12].

∼

Finally, because the Sweet–Parker model with classi-
cal (Spitzer) resistivity is too slow to explain solar ﬂares,
one has to add new physics to the model, e.g., locally
enhanced anomalous resistivity. This should change the
situation dramatically, and may even create a situation
where a Petschek-like structure with fast reconnection is
possible (see, for example, Refs. [13,14,1]).

Abstract. Dimensional continuation is employed to compute the energy loss rate
for a non-relativistic particle moving through a highly ionized plasma. No restriction
is made on the charge, mass, or speed of this particle, but it is assumed that the
plasma is not strongly coupled in that the dimensionless plasma coupling parameter
g = e2κD/4πT is small, where κD is the Debye wave number. To leading order in
this coupling, dE/dx is of the generic form g2 ln[g2C]. The prefactor of the logarithm
is well known. We compute the constant C under the logarithm exactly. Our result
diﬀers from approximations given in the literature, with diﬀerences in the range of
about 20% for cases relevant to inertial conﬁnement fusion experiments.

where the Coulomb logarithm ln Λb involves a ratio of short- and long-distance length
scales. To compute ln Λb, we employ the method of dimensional continuation [1]. To
introduce this method, we consider the Coulomb potential φν(r) of a point source in ν
1/rν−2. Clearly the long and short distance behavior of φν
spatial dimensions: φν(r)
depends on the spatial dimensionality ν. In high ν, short distance (hard) interactions
are accentuated, while in low ν the large distance (soft) physics predominates.

∼

For Coulomb interactions, ν = 3 is special in that neither hard nor soft processes are
dominant. For ν < 3, the soft physics is predominant, and for ν > 3 the hard processes
are dominant. The energy loss for ν > 3, dE B/dx, is obtained from the Boltzmann (B)
3)−1 that reﬂects an infrared divergence in the
equation, and it contains a pole (ν
3+ . The energy loss for ν < 3, dE LB/dx, is obtained from
scattering process when ν
ν)−1 that reﬂects
the Lenard-Balescu (LB) kinetic equation, and it contains a pole (3

and it is completely ﬁnite. Hence the two poles must cancel. The dependence of the
residues of the poles on ν brings in a logarithm of the ratio of the relevant short- and
long-distance length scales, which is precisely the Coulomb logarithm.

The total stopping power is the sum of the contributions from large-distance collective
excitations dE LB/dx and from short-distance hard collisions dE B/dx, that is, the sum
over species b of Eqs. (7), (11), and (12). The poles at ν = 3 and the ln K terms cancel.
Our result for dE/dx is generically of the form n (ln n + C) in the plasma density n, and
it is accurate to all orders in the quantum parameter ηb. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate our
result with an example that is relevant to the DT plasmas in laser fusion capsules.

R
T = 3 keV and the electron number density is ne = 1025 cm−3. The plasma coupling
is small, g = 0.011, and so our calculation (BPS) is essentially exact. Our result is
shown by the solid curve. The work of Li and Petrasso [2] is often used in laser fusion
simulations. Their result (LP) is shown by the dashed line. Note that the diﬀerence
in the total ranges between our result and that of Li and Petrasso of about 5 µm is a
little larger than 20%.

Figure 2. The α particle dE(x)/dx (in Mev/µm) vs. x (in µm) split into separate ion
(spiked curves) and electron components (softly decreasing curves). The area under
each curve gives the corresponding energy partition into electrons and ions. For our
results (BPS), the total energy deposited into electrons is Ee = 3.16 MeV and into
ions is EI = 0.38 MeV, while LP give E LP
I = 0.43 MeV. These
energies sum to the initial α particle energy of E0 = 3.54 MeV. Note that BPS has a
longer α particle range and deposits less energy into ions than LP. Both observations
would tend to make fusion more diﬃcult to achieve for BPS than for LP.

Abstract

Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations for a one-component plasma

(OCP) are presented. Quantum eﬀects are included in the form of the Kelbg

potential. Results for the dynamical structure factor are compared with the

Vlasov and RPA (random phase approximation) theories. The inﬂuence of

the coupling parameter Γ, degeneracy parameter ρΛ3 and the form of the pair

interaction on the optical plasmon dispersion is investigated. An improved

analytical approximation for the dispersion of Langmuir waves is presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

The model of a classical one-component plasma has - due to its simplicity - been widely

investigated both theoretically and with various numerical and simulation methods, see e.g.

[1–3] and [4,5], respectively. Since the pioneering numerical work of Brush, Sahlin, Teller

[6], the thermodynamic and dynamic characteristics of the classical OCP have been stud-

ied in detail.

In particular, the dependence of the properties on the coupling parameter

Γ = 4πe2/(¯rkBT ), where ¯r = ( 3

4πρ)1/3 is the mean interparticle distance and ρ the density,

have been investigated up to very large values of Γ [7,8]. Among the most important ther-

modynamic results is the prediction of crystallization at values of Γ of the order of 172-180

[9,10]. Furthermore, investigations of the dynamic properties of strongly correlated classical

plasmas have indicated that the wave number dependent plasmon dispersion changes from

monotonic growth, common for weakly coupled plasmas, to a decreasing dispersion around

Γ

3 [1].

≈

On the other hand, there is growing interest in the dynamic properties of dense quantum

plasmas, in particular in astrophysics, laser plasmas and condensed matter. While the case

of strong degeneracy (strong quantum limit) and weak coupling at very high densities is

well described by the random phase approximation (RPA, see e.g. [11–14]), the properties

at intermediate coupling and degeneracy remain poorly explored. Especially, one is interested

in the dynamic plasma behavior in cases where the average kinetic energy is of the same order

as the mean potential energy, i.e. Γ

1, where collisionless theories such as the RPA fail,

∼

e.g. [12,13,15]. For these situations, quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations [16]

are the appropriate numerical approach which, however, is yet lacking the required eﬃciency.

For weakly degenerate plasmas, with ρΛ3

1, where Λ is the DeBroglie wave length (see

below), it is expected that one can perform much simpler classical MD simulations using

eﬀective quantum pair potentials, e.g. [3,17]. These potentials can be derived from the 2-

particle Slater sum using Morita’s method. It is the aim of this paper to explore this MD

approach in detail, especially for the analysis of the optical (Langmuir) plasmon dispersion.

It is natural to start this analysis with OCP–simulations because they have the advan-

tage of the absence of a collapse of oppositely charged particles at small distances. On the

other hand, the existence of a homogeneous background of oppositely charged particles leads

to some additional technical diﬃculties compared to 2-component systems, due to restricted

carrier rearrangement causing less eﬀective screening of the Coulomb interaction. One major

problem of MD simulations of dynamical properties is that the behavior at small wave num-

bers is diﬃcult to investigate. The reason is that large box-sizes are required which, for the

analysis of high density plasmas, translates into large particle numbers. The current increase

of available computer power gives one the possibility to investigate size-dependent properties

like the density-density correlations

for smaller k-vectors than before. In this

paper, we are able to present accurate results for the dynamical properties of the OCP, such

as the dynamical structure factor and the wave vector dispersion of Langmuir oscillations.

Our simulations for intermediate values of the coupling parameter, Γ = 1 . . . 4, show an in-

teresting dispersion: the frequency increases up to a maximum and, for large wave numbers,

decreases again. Further, we investigate the role of quantum eﬀects by comparing simula-

tions with the Coulomb potential and an eﬀective quantum pair potential (Kelbg potential

[17]) for the region of small and intermediate coupling. We found that quantum diﬀraction

eﬀects have noticable inﬂuence on the behavior of the optical dispersion curves. Increase of

the degeneracy leads to a softenig of the dispersion ω(k), especially at intermediate wave

vectors.

II. DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE OCP

A. Statistical approach

A central quantity to determine the dynamic properties of charged many-particle systems

is the frequency-dependent dielectric function ǫ(~k, ω) which, for the OCP, is given by

ǫ(~k, ω) = 1

UC(~k)Π(~k, ω).

(1)

−

Here UC(~k) is the spatial Fourier transform of the Coulomb potential, UC(k) = 4πe2/k2, and

Π(~k, ω) is the longitudinal polarization function. Thus, many-body eﬀects enter the dielectric

function via Π. There exist many approximations for the latter function, the simplest one

being mean-ﬁeld theories which neglect short-range correlation eﬀects, i.e. collisions between

the particles. For the classical OCP, the mean-ﬁeld result is the Vlasov polarization:

function. Further, F is the distribution function. The Vlasov polarization applies only to

classical plasmas, where the wave character of the particles can be neglected. Quantum

eﬀects are important if the interparticle distance or the Debye radius become comparable to

the DeBroglie wave length Λ = h/√2πmkBT . Therefore, quantum diﬀraction eﬀects should

show up in the dielectric properties at large wave numbers. The quantum generalization of

the Vlasov polarization is the RPA polarization function given by

In this paper we consider only plasmas in equilibrium, so F and f are the Maxwell and

Fermi function, respectively. One readily conﬁrms that, in the limit of long wavelengths,

~k

0, indeed the RPA result (3) goes over to the Vlasov polarization function (2). An

important quantity which follows from dielectric function (1) via the ﬂuctuation-dissipation

theorem is the dynamical structure factor S(~k, ω)

which shows the frequency spectrum of density ﬂuctuations for a given value of ~k.

As mentioned above, the mean ﬁeld expressions (2) and (3) neglect short-range correla-

tions and are, therefore, valid only for weakly coupled plasmas, Γ

1. There exist many

≪

theoretical concepts to go beyond the RPA which are based on quantum kinetic theory,

density functional theory and other approaches. This is beyond the scope of this paper, see

4

e.g. Ref. [12,13,15] and references therein. Here, we consider the alternative approach to

the OCP at ﬁnite coupling which is based on molecular dynamics simulations.

B. Molecular dynamics approach to the dynamical properties

The dielectric and dynamical properties of an interacting many-particle system are easily

accessible from the density-density correlation function which is deﬁned as

where N is the number of particles. ρ~k(t) is the Fourier component of the density,

which is computed from the trajectories ~ri(t) of all particles. The dynamical structure factor

is just the Fourier transform of the density-density correlation function (5)

Equation (7) can be directly compared to formula (4) and, thus, allows for a comparison of

the simulation results with the statistical theories. Furthermore, Eq. (7) allows to investigate

the inﬂuence of quantum eﬀects on the dynamical properties and plasmon dispersion of

the OCP. Variations of the interaction potential (see below) directly aﬀect the particle

trajectories and, via Eqs. (5)–(7), the dynamical structure factor.

III. DETAILS OF THE MD-SIMULATIONS

The simulations have been performed in a cube of length L containing N interacting

electrons on a uniform positive background. For this system, we solved Newton’s equations

of motion containing all pair interactions which are derived from a total potential U(r),

see below. As an algorithm of motion we used a second-order scheme in form of the Swope

algorithm [18]. Since our simulations are performed in the microcanocial ensemble, the mean

5

kinetic energy may change. Therefore, to maintain the chosen value of temperature and Γ,

we applied scaling (renormalization) of all velocities at every second step.

A central goal of our simulations was to study the inﬂuence of quantum eﬀects. We,

therefore, performed several simulations which used either a Coulomb potential or an eﬀec-

tive quantum pair potential (see below). To permit ﬂexibility in the use of the potential,

U was divided into a short-range and a long-range part, U = U sr + U lr, where quantum

eﬀects inﬂuence only U sr, whereas the behavior at large distances, U lr, is dominated by the

long-range Coulomb interaction. Let us ﬁrst describe the treatment of the long-range term.

A. Long-range interaction

The long-range interaction was computed in standard way using periodic boundary con-

ditions and the Ewald summation procedure [20,21]. As a result, the long-range potential

is given by the Coulomb interaction in the main box and all image cells:

where erfc is the complementary error function, L - the side length of the simulation cell

and ~n - a vector of integer numbers which labels the periodic images of the simulation

box. In this expression, the ﬁrst term corresponds to a potential of particles with Gaussian

broadened charge distribution around the electrons with a width of √π, the second one -

the compensating Gaussian distributions, and the last one accounts for the inﬂuence of the

homogeneous background. It turns out that the second term in (8) can be reduced to 2 loops

(one over the particles and one over the vectors ~n in the reciprocal space) and is not very time

consuming. The more complicated part is the ﬁrst term which contains three loops. In case

of a two-component plasma, a proper choice of the width of the Gaussian distribution and use

of periodic boundary conditions greatly simpliﬁes this term due to cancellations. In contrast,

for an OCP, the background cancels the interactions only partially, “statically”. As a result,

convergence of the sum is worse, and one needs to take into account all ﬁrst neighboring

image cells (total of 26) at every time step. The contribution of all neighboring cells except

for the main one (0 <

√3) was computed, before the start of the simulations and

~n

stored in 3-dimensional tables for the potential and forces. During the simulations, we used

3D-bilinear interpolation at every step to obtain the values of the potential and forces for

intermediate distances. We found that 100 grid points in every direction are adequate, so

the total size of the table was 106 elements. The particle interactions inside the main (~n = 0)

cell were evaluated directly at every time step without minimum image convention.

B. Short-range interaction. Quantum eﬀects

Let us now discuss the short-range potential. As has been shown by Kelbg and co-workers

[17,19], quantum eﬀects can be treated eﬃciently by an eﬀective pair potential, the Kelbg

potential:

. As a consequence of quantum eﬀects, this potential diﬀers from the Coulomb

potential at small distances r

λ and is ﬁnite at r = 0. Further, it is temperature-dependent

via the thermal DeBroglie wavelength. The Kelbg potential can be regarded as the proper

quantum pair potential following from the two-particle Slater sum S2 without exchange

lnS2 =

(11)

It treats quantum diﬀraction eﬀects exactly, up ﬁrst order in Γ. Frequently other quantum

pair potentials have been used, including the Deutsch potential [22], which has the same

value at r = 0 but diﬀers from the Kelbg potential at intermediate distances. As was

mentioned by Hansen [23], symmetry eﬀects do not have a big inﬂuence on the dynamical

properties (although they give a major contribution to the static properties, especially for

7

the light mass components). Using the Kelbg potential (10), we can immediately separate

the short-range part of the interaction,

(12)

which has been calculated together with the ﬁrst sum of Eq. (9) using the interpolation

table.

The Kelbg potential contains just the lowest order quantum corrections (lowest order in

e2) and is, thus, accurate at small coupling, Γ < 1. Nevertheless, we expect that it correctly

reproduces the inﬂuence of quantum eﬀects also at intermediate coupling, Γ

5. Further

≤

improvements are straightforward, e.g. by including exchange eﬀects or by evaluating the

full two-particle Slater sum. We note that the described numerical procedure applies to such

improved quantum pair potentials as well, even if they are not given analytically.

C. Thermodynamic and dynamical quantities

Solving Newton’s equations with forces derived from the total potential U sr + U lr, we

computed thermodynamic and static quantities, such as total energy and pair distribution

function in usual manner. The results will be presented in the next section. Here we discuss

some details on computation of the dynamical properties, as they require much more eﬀort

and computation time in order to achieve suﬃcient accuracy.

To obtain useful results for the dynamical structure factor, requires simulation results

in a suﬃciently broad range of wave numbers and frequencies. Natural units of the wave

number and frequency are 1/¯r and the plasma frequency ωpl =

4πe2ρ/m, respectively,

which will be used in the following. The minimum wave number kmin depends on the size

q

L of the simulation box and thus, for a given density or coupling parameter, on the number

of particles N. One readily veriﬁes that kmin = 2π/L = 2π(ρ/N)1/3 or, using dimensionless

wave numbers, qmin = kmin¯r = (6π2/N)1/3. Clearly, to reduce kmin requires an essential

increase of the number of particles in the simulation.

8

The simulation accuracy can be further increased by taking advantage of the isotropy

of the plasma in wave vector space. Indeed, in equilibrium, the density-density correlation

function and dynamical structure factor should only depend on the absolute value of the

wave vector. On the other hand, the simulations yield slightly diﬀerent results for diﬀerent

directions of the wave vector. Averaging over all results corresponding to the same absolute

value of ~k allows to reduce the statistical error. For example, the minimum wave number

kmin corresponds to directions of ~k along either the x-, y- or z-axis, cf. Eq. (6), so we can use

the average of the three. The next larger value is √2 kmin, corresponding to the diagonals

in the x-y, x-z and y-z planes. The third value, √3 kmin, corresponds to the space diagonal

and is not degenerate; consequently it carries the largest statistical error. This is the main

reason for the ﬂuctuations of the numerical results for the wave vector dispersion, see for

example Fig. 5.

Finally, to resolve the collective plasma oscillations, the duration of the simulations has to

be much larger than the plasma period. Also, increased simulation times leads to a reduction

of the noise. We found that times of the order of 250 plasma periods are adequate.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We have performed a series of simulations for varying values of Γ and ρΛ3, using the

Coulomb and Kelbg potential. Also, time step and particle number have been varied until a

satisfactory compromise between accuracy and simulation eﬃciency has been achieved. The

parameters of the runs chosen for the ﬁgures below are summarized in Table I. We mention

that kinetic energy conservation in all runs (if velocity scaling was turned oﬀ) did not exceed

0.1%. Also, the results for the total energy (not shown), in case of the Coulomb potential,

agree very well with data from the literature.

We ﬁrst consider the pair distribution function g(r) for varying interaction potentials

and parameter values. Fig. 1 shows g(r) for three values of the coupling parameter, Γ =

0.5, 1, 4. As expected, the Coulomb pair distribution function is close to the Debye-H¨uckel

9

limit for small coupling, with increasing Γ, the deviations, especially around r = ¯r, grow

systematically. The Kelbg pair distributions practically coincide with the Coulomb functions

for r > 0.6 ¯r but deviate from the latter at small distances of the order of the thermal

DeBroigle wave length Λ where quantum eﬀects are important. Clearly, with increasing

degeneracy, the ratio Λ/¯r increases, and the deviations extend to larger distances and grow

in magnitude. With increasing Γ, the deviations become smaller since Coulomb eﬀects

dominate the behavior at small distances.

Let us now turn to the dynamical properties. In case of an OCP, charge and mass ﬂuc-

tuations are identical because of the rigid opposite charge background. In our simulations,

we have calculated the density-density correlation function (5) and, by numerical Fourier

transformation, obtained the dynamical structure factor S(q, ω) for several (from 6 to 10, de-

pending on the simulation) wave numbers, the values of which are determined by the size of

the simulation box L (see above). The value of the smallest wave number is given in Table I.

The frequency dependence of S(q, ω) for several wave vectors is presented in Figs. 2-4 for the

Coulomb and Kelbg potentials. Also, the results of the mean-ﬁeld models are shown. The

peak of the structure factor is related to the optical plasmon (Langmuir mode) of the elec-

trons, its position shows the plasmon frequency Ω(k), its width - the damping of the mode.

In the limit k

ωpl for all models. For increasing wave numbers, the width of

→

→

the peak grows steadily, and it merges with the continuum of single-particle excitations, e.g.

[13,14], therefore, no results for larger wave numbers are shown.

Consider now the results for the plasmon dispersion more in detail, cf. Fig. 5. First, we

discuss the mean ﬁeld results (4) which are calculated using the Vlasov and RPA polariza-

tions, Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. The Vlasov result was computed using the formulas

given in the review of Kugler [24], and for the RPA, a code was developed which accu-

rately evaluates the pole integration in Eq. (3). Both approximations show the same general

trend for small and intermediate wave numbers: with increasing wave number, the plasmon

frequency and the damping increase. At large q, the dispersion exhibits a maximum and de-

creases again. In all situations, the RPA yields a slightly smaller frequency than the Vlasov

10

result, whereas the damping values are very close to each other.

Let us now turn to the simulation results. The Coulomb and Kelbg simulations have

been performed for exactly the same parameters, except for N and run time (cf. Table I).

(Notice that, in contrast to the Kelbg case, the Coulomb simulations depend only on Γ which

can be achieved by various combinations of density and temperature). Comparison of the

two simulations shows, cf. Fig. 2, that the results for the structure factors are very similar

in case of small Γ. Peak positions and widths as well as the low and high frequency tails are

very close to each other. The reason is obvious: since the potentials (and pair distributions,

cf. Fig. 1) diﬀer only at a small interparticle distances of the order of Λ, diﬀerences in the

structure factor would show up only at k > 2π/Λ, which is about an order of magnitude

larger than the wave numbers shown in Fig. 2. There, the plasmon peak has already a width

of the order of the frequency and no longer describes a well-deﬁned collective excitation.

It is now interesting to compare the simulation results to the theoretical approximations.

The ﬁrst observation is that the simulation peaks are signiﬁcantly broader, cf. Fig. 2. This

is obvious since the simulations fully include interparticle correlations missing in the mean-

ﬁeld results. Consequently, the plasmon damping contains collisional damping in addition

to the Landau damping (which is the only damping mechanism in the mean-ﬁeld models).

Correspondingly, the plasmon peaks in the simulations are shifted to smaller frequencies.

This eﬀect grows with increasing wave number as well as with increasing coupling (see also

Fig. 5). We note that, in our simulations, this shift is observed for all wave numbers, which

is in contrast to the result of Hansen [see Fig. 9 of Ref. [23] for q = 0.6187]. In other words,

the plasmon dispersion curves from the MD simulations are lower than the mean-ﬁeld result

for all wave vectors ~k, which is seen more clearly in Fig. 5. As expected the MD curves for

the structure factor are much closer to the RPA than to the Vlasov result.

In Fig. 5 we plot the optical plasmon dispersion curves for three values of the coupling

parameter for the Vlasov and RPA dispersions together with the simulation results. We

further show the well-known analytical approximation to the Langmuir dispersion,

(13)

Clearly, this predicts a monotonically increasing dispersion. However, this approximation is

valid only for k < 1/rD and for Γ < 1. Let us now consider the simulation results which do

not have this limitation. In Fig. 5 we show the MD results for a Coulomb potential and for the

Kelbg potential for three values of the degeneracy parameter, ρΛ3 = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0. One clearly

sees that, for these parameters, the dispersion is positive, dω(q)/dq > 0, up to wave numbers

of the order of one over the mean interparticle distance. For larger q, the dispersion changes

sign. This general trend is observed for the Coulomb and the Kelbg potential. On the other

hand, with increasing quantum eﬀects, ρΛ3, the deviations between the two potentials are

growing, which becomes more pronounced as Γ increases, cf. the curves for Γ = 1 and Γ = 4:

the dispersion in case of the Kelbg potential shows a softer increase with increasing wave

number and reaches a lower maximum approximately at the same wave number as in the

Coulomb case. We mention that this sign change of the dispersion has not been reported

by Hansen [1]. Comparing the simulations with the mean-ﬁeld results, we again see that

the MD dispersions proceed lower than the mean ﬁeld results, and this eﬀect grows with

increasing Γ and increasing wave number. Once more, we conﬁrm that the RPA dispersion is

much closer to the MD result than the Vlasov dispersion, at least for Γ

0.5. [As mentioned

≤

above, the simulation results for the dispersion show certain statistical ﬂuctuations due to

the varying accuracy of the results for the diﬀerent wave numbers].

Let us now consider the plasmon damping more in detail. Fig. 6, shows the damping

(full width at half maximum of the plasmon peak of the structure factor) as a function of

wave number. It is interesting to compare with the familiar analytical expression from the

Vlasov theory, e.g. [26],

δ(κ) =

ω(q)], and is limited to small wave numbers κ

1. As

≪

≪

expected, the damping given by formula (14) which is only Landau damping, is much smaller

than the damping found in the simulations, as the latter contain the full collisional damping

also. Obviously, for small coupling and small q, Eq. (14) shows the correct trend. However,

deviations increase rapidly with growing coupling parameter. Furthermore, the simulations

which are not limited to small wave numbers, show a qualitatively diﬀerent behavior at

large q: a monotonic increase of the damping. Interesingly, with increasing Γ the damping

is reduced, cf. Figs. 6a,b.

Finally, we try to extend the analytical result for the plasmon dispersion, Eq. (13), to

larger Γ and to include quantum eﬀects. To this end, we used the MD data with the Kelbg

potential to construct an improved ﬁt of the form ω(q) = ωpl (1 + aq2 + bq4)1/2. The result

is shown in Fig. 7 for Γ = 1 and Γ = 4. Due to the large ﬂuctuations in the dispersion

data and the increasing damping for large wave numbers, we used a weighted ﬁt where the

smallest q

values had the largest weight and the statistical errors of the individual points

−

have been taken into account. Table II contains the resulting ﬁt parameters. According to

this data both parameters a and b depend on Γ and ρΛ3. The parameter a is close to 1/Γ in

agreement with Eq. (13), but with increasing Γ, deviations are growing, compare Table II.

We see no systematic inﬂuence of quantum eﬀects on the parameter a for Γ = 1. Noticeable

eﬀects show up for Γ = 4, where increased degeneracy leads to a reduction of the coeﬃcient

a. The second ﬁt parameter allows to qualitatively reproduce the change of the sign of the

dispersion. The overall agreement is satisfactory for wave numbers up to the inverse mean

interparticle distance up to which the plasmons are comparatively weakly damped.

We have presented classical molecular dynamics simulations of the dielectric properties

of a one-component plasma at intermediate coupling and degeneracy, Γ

4 and ρΛ3

ited applicablility to quantum plasmas. We used, as an eﬀective quantum pair potential,

the Kelbg potential which correctly describes quantum diﬀraction eﬀects for small Γ. In

general, we found that the simulation results for the dielectric properties and the plasmon

dispersion with the Coulomb and the Kelbg potential are rather close, but start to deviate

from each other as Γ increases. Nevertheless, the use of the Kelbg potential is preferable. It

correctly treats close collisions, i.e. the two-particle interaction at distances smaller than the

DeBroglie wavelength. This is of even higher importance in the case of two-component plas-

mas where the Kelbg potential allows to avoid the collapse of oppositely charged particles.

Therefore, the present investigation should be important for future work on two-component

plasmas. Finally, we mention that the Kelbg potential is only the ﬁrst term of a Γ expan-

sion. Therefore, for Γ > 1 the account of higher order corrections to the quantum diﬀraction

eﬀects is necessary. Work on this subject is in progress.

TABLE II. Fit parameters of the Langmuir dispersion curves shown on Fig. 7. The ﬁt equation

was taken in the form of ω(q)/ωpl = (1 + aq2 + bq4)1/2. Parameters of the ﬁt for Γ = 1 and ρΛ3 =

0.1 are less reliable, because of the absence of data for big wave vectors, cf. Table I.

FIG. 1. Pair distribution functions for Γ= 0.5 (upper ﬁgure), Γ= 1.0 (middle ﬁgure), 4.0 (lower

ﬁgure), and ρΛ3 = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 for systems with Coulomb and Kelbg potential. Further, the

Debye-H¨uckel (DH) limit is shown (solid line). Line styles are the same in all three ﬁgures. Inset

in the middle Fig. shows the inﬂuence of the degeneracy at small distances. The result for Γ =

4.0 , ρΛ3 = 0.1 with Kelbg potential are not distinguishable from the Coulomb result and are not

plotted.

FIG. 5. Optical plasmon dispersion for various coupling and degeneracy parameters from MD

simulations with Coulomb and quantum potentials. Also shown are results of the Vlasov and RPA

approximations, and of the analytical approximation of Eq. (13). For Γ = 4.0 and ρΛ3 = 0.1

(upper graph) the MD simulations with Kelbg potential and the RPA curve are not shown since

they almost coincide with the Coulomb simulation and the Vlasov curve, respectively.

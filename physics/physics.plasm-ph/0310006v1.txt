Abstract

It is demonstrated that the deformation of magnetic ﬁeld lines in incom-
pressible magnetohydrodynamic ﬂows results from a compressible mapping.
Appearance of zeroes for the mapping Jacobian correspond to the breaking of
magnetic ﬁeld lines, associated with local blowup of the magnetic ﬁeld. The
possibility of such events is found to be unlikely in two dimensions but not in
three dimensions.

1 Introduction

An important property of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is the frozenness of
magnetic ﬁeld in the plasma: ﬂuid particles remain pasted on their magnetic lines
that are driven by the transverse velocity component. This remark is the start-
ing point of a mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian description of ideal MHD ﬂows, named
magnetic line representation (MLR) and ﬁrst formulated in [1]. The idea originates
from the vortex line representation (VLR) of hydrodynamic ﬂows [2] that involves
a two-dimensional Lagrangian marker labeling each vortex line, together with a pa-
rameterization of these lines. In three dimensions (3D), this representation enables
one to partially integrate the Euler equations with respect to a continuous inﬁnity of
integrals of motion called the Cauchy invariants. A main peculiarity of the transfor-
mation associated with the vortex line dynamics is its compressible character that,
as recently pointed out by one of the authors [3], is amenable of a simple interpreta-
tion. The Euler equations can be rewritten as the equations of motion for a charged
compressible ﬂuid moving under the action of eﬀective self-consistent electric and

singularities in compressible ﬂows is connected with the emergence of shocks, cor-
responding to the formation of folds in the classical catastrophe theory [4]. In the
gas-dynamic case, this process is completely characterized by the mapping deﬁned
by the transition from the usual Eulerian to the Lagrangian description. A zero of
the Jacobian corresponds to the emergence of a singularity for the spatial deriva-
tives of the velocity and density of the ﬂuid. Due to the compressible character of
VLR, the phenomenon of breaking becomes also possible for vortex lines in ideal
incompressible ﬂuids. Vortex line breaking was ﬁrst studied for three-dimensional
dr where Ω is the vorticity
integrable hydrodynamics with Hamiltonian
[5]. This model and the Euler equation are both incompressible and have the same
symplectic operator deﬁning the Poisson structure. Breaking of vortex lines is as-
sociated with the touching of two vortex lines and results in an inﬁnite vorticity.
Recent numerical simulations [6, 7] have suggested the possibility of such a scenario
for the 3D Euler equations, but further investigations are required to reach a deﬁ-
nite conclusion. In ideal MHD, we can expect the same behavior for the magnetic
ﬁeld which is a frozen-in quantity. In two dimensions (2D) however, the fact that
vorticity is perpendicular to the ﬂow plane while the magnetic ﬁeld lies in it, puts
a limit to the analogy, making magnetic ﬁeld line breaking a priori possible in two
dimensions, while singularities are excluded in 2D Euler ﬂows. It will nevertheless
be argued in this paper that magnetic ﬁeld blowup is unlikely in 2D MHD.

In Section 2, we recall the Cauchy formula for MHD ﬂows, which plays a central
role in the derivation of the Weber type transformation discussed in Section 3. This
transformation is obtained by extending ideas of paper [3] to ideal incompressible
MHD ﬂows. We in particular indicate how the MHD equations can be partially
integrated. Section 4 addresses the two-dimensional case where two conservation
laws are established. In Section 5, we discuss the possibility of magnetic line break-
ing as a local blowup of the magnetic ﬁeld, a process diﬀerent from the gradient
singularity associated with current sheets formation ([8] and references therein). A
brief conclusion is provided by Section 6.

As well known, the magnetic ﬁeld h in ideal incompressible MHD obeys

that formally coincides with the equation governing the vorticity Ω in Euler hy-
drodynamics. Since only the transverse velocity v⊥ to the local magnetic ﬁeld is
relevant in this equation, we introduce new Lagrangian trajectories

Since div v⊥ is generically non zero, the mapping (2) is compressible and the Jaco-
bian J can vanish. This observation is central in the discussion of the possibility of
magnetic ﬁeld blowup presented in Section 5.

As a result, we have two equations of motion for the mapping (3) and for the

vorticity,

Ω = curlrv, divr v = 0,

(25)

this constitutes a closed system of equations that provides a magnetic line repre-
sentation for incompressible MHD (to be compared with [1]). These equations are
solved with respect to two Lagrangian invariants h0(a) and Ω0(a). It is possible to
show [1] that conservation of these invariants in MHD is a consequence of relabeling
symmetry, as it is the case for Euler equation (see, e.g. the reviews [9, 10]).

The magnetic line representation involving the local change of variables r =
r(a, t), breaks down at singular points where the Jacobian is zero or inﬁnity and
the normal velocity is not deﬁned.

Let us consider the null point r = r(t) deﬁned by

h(r(t), t) = 0.

(26)

Diﬀerentiating this equation with respect to time, we get

with ˙r(t) = v(r(t), t), which shows that the null points are advected by the ﬂow.
The velocity v at these points is deﬁned by inverting the curl operator in (25).

Null-points are topological singularities for the tangent vector ﬁeld τ (r). Their
classiﬁcation depends on the space dimension D. Topological constraints that can be
considered as additional conditions for the MLR system, can be written as integrals
of the vector ﬁeld τ (r) and its derivatives over the boundary of simply-connected

The above representation involves simultaneous use of Lagrangian variables in

representation formulated in the sole physical space.

4 Conservation laws in two dimensions

The magnetic line representation signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes in two dimensions where
the magnetic ﬁeld lies on the same plane as the ﬂow. It is convenient to introduce,
instead of the initial position a, the scalar magnetic potential ψ deﬁned by

can then be taken as a Lagrangian marker of the magnetic lines. Solving locally eq.
(34) in the form y = y(x, ψ, t), provides the desired mapping that replaces (2).

This change of variables, being a mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian one, realizes a
transformation to a curvilinear system of coordinates movable with magnetic lines.

(33) and (11), we use

equations and to (x, ψ, t) in the right hand sides.

which are equivalent to the Cauchy formula (10) for the magnetic ﬁeld in 2D. The
derivative yψ in the denominators holds for the Jacobian J. The equation for the
quantity yψ can be found by diﬀerentiating (38) with respect to ψ and applying the

Equations (40) and (43) provide conservation laws for 2D incompressible MHD.
They remain valid in the hydrodynamic limit, provided ψ is replaced by vorticity
or by any other Lagrangian invariant.

5 Possibility of magnetic line breaking

An important property of the magnetic line representation concerns the compress-
ibility of the mapping (2), which permits magnetic line breaking. At the breaking
point, the magnetic ﬁeld, according to (10), becomes inﬁnite due to the vanishing
of the Jacobian. As it follows from references [3, 5, 6, 7], the possibility of vortex
line breaking depends on the space dimension. For two-dimensional ﬂows described
by the Euler equations, vorticity is perpendicular to the ﬂow plane and therefore
div v⊥ = 0. As the consequence, the corresponding mapping is incompressible and
the Jacobian remains constant.

For 2D incompressible MHD, the situation is diﬀerent since the magnetic ﬁeld
lies in the ﬂow plane. The velocity can therefore be decomposed into transverse
and longitudinal components relative to the magnetic ﬁeld direction. In such a case
div v⊥

= 0 and the breaking of magnetic lines is not a priori excluded.

Let us thus assume that a breaking of magnetic lines occurs. Denote by t =

˜t(a) > 0 the positive roots of the equation

J(a, t) = 0,

and ﬁnd the minimal value t0 = mina ˜t(a) which deﬁnes the ﬁrst instant of time
when the Jacobian vanishes. Let a = a0 be the Lagrangian coordinate of the point
where this minimum is attained. We ﬁrst consider that near the singular point, as
t

t0, the Jacobian behaves as

J = α(t0 −

t) + γij∆ai∆aj

(46)

where α > 0, γij is a positive deﬁnite (generically non-degenerated) matrix and

6 Conclusion

The mechanism for a ﬁnite-time singularity addressed in this paper corresponds
to the breaking of magnetic ﬁeld lines resulting in a catastrophic ampliﬁcation of
the local magnetic ﬁeld strength. It is worth to notice that this process does not
contradict the necessary condition for blowup in MHD [11] that represents the
analog of the Beale-Kato-Majda inequality [12]. According to [11] the velocity and
magnetic ﬁeld retain their smoothness on a time interval [0, T ] as long as

Hence a ﬁnite-time singularity of any kind must be accompanied by the blow-up
h. However, this criterion does not exclude a blowup of the magnetic
of Ω and
ﬁeld as well. Constraints are nevertheless provided by regularity theorems; a result
for example states that the solution remains globally smooth if the initial magnetic
ﬁeld has a mean component suﬃciently large compared to the ﬂuctuations, assumed
to be localized [13]. This property is a consequence of the fact that only counter-
propagating Alfv´en wave packets nonlinearly interact.

A speciﬁc conclusion of this paper is that magnetic ﬁeld blowup resulting from
magnetic line breaking is unlikely in two dimensions. Nevertheless, the present for-
malism cannot capture the behavior near a neutral X-point. Numerical evidence and
self-similar reductions however indicate that in this case the current ampliﬁcation
is exponential in time [14] [15].

Furthermore, recent direct numerical simulations of 3D MHD indicate the for-
mation of quasi-two dimensional current sheets that result in a depletion of the
nonlinearity strength [16], a mechanism that could prevent singularities. In order
to validate the blowup scenario discussed in this paper, it is thus of interest to look
for initial conditions that do not lead to bidimensionalization and has an initial ve-
locity ﬁeld whose component transverse to the local magnetic ﬁeld has a signiﬁcant
divergence.

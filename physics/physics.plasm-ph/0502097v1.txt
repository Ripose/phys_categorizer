The linear instability that induces a relativistic electron beam passing through a return plasma
current to ﬁlament transversely is often related to some ﬁlamentation mode with wave vector normal
to the beam or confused with Weibel modes. We show that these modes may not be relevant in this
matter and identify the most unstable mode on the two-stream/ﬁlamentation branch as the main
trigger for ﬁlamentation. This sets both the characteristic transverse and longitudinal ﬁlamentation
scales in the non-resistive initial stage.

Inertial conﬁnement fusion schemes commonly involve
in their ﬁnal stage the interaction between some highly
energetic particle beams and a dense plasma target.
This is in particular valid for the Fast Ignition Scenario
[1] (FIS) where some laser-produced relativistic electron
beam would eventually propagate into the dense plasma
where it would be stopped. This process would lead to
strong local heating and the ignition of a fusion burn
wave. In this respect, microscopic turbulence in beam-
plasma systems is one of the main potentially deleterious
eﬀects for inertial fusion schemes since it may prevent the
conditions for burn to be met by broadening the phase
area where particles deposit their energy. Within the FIS
framework, a strong research eﬀort has thus been put re-
cently on the interaction of a relativistic electron beam
with a plasma with a focus on beam ﬁlamentation insta-
bility, that is microscopic in the transverse direction (see
e.g. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). The experimental evidence of ﬁlamen-
tation of very high current laser-produced electron beams
was recently reported for conditions relevant to the FIS
[7]. More generally, ﬁlamentation is a potential instabil-
ity in beam-plasma systems in frameworks ranging from
accelerators physics to solar ﬂares.

In the linear stage, ﬁlamentation is generally studied
under some simplifying ab-initio transverse approxima-
tion of the dielectric tensor, so that ﬁlamentation insta-
bility is attributed to the exponential growth of unstable
electromagnetic purely transverse modes (k
E = 0) with
wave vector k normal to the beam [4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
It is also common to refer to this instability as Weibel
instability [4, 7, 8], though the original mode studied
by Weibel [13] would require some plasma temperature
anisotropy to be driven. Figure 1 sketches the original
deﬁnitions of various modes under the original Weibel’s
scenario where k is parallel to the beam, along the low
temperature axis. As long as the beam is not relativis-
tic, the largest instability it undergoes is the two-stream

one, where the second “stream” is the return current it
generates in the plasma. But in the relativistic regime,
the “ﬁlamentation” growth rate eventually exceeds the
two-stream one and is supposed to induce beam ﬁlamen-
tation.

In reality, the beam suﬀers much more instabilities at

stream instabilities pertain to various orientations of the
wave vector and various kinds of waves (transverse or
longitudinal), but in the real world the beam-plasma sys-
tem triggers every possible modes allowed by Maxwell
equations with a wide range of wave vector orientation.
Among all the triggered modes, the unstable ones shall
start growing exponentially while the most unstable one
shall mostly shape the beam. When it comes to know
how the beam is eventually aﬀected when entering the
plasma, one needs therefore to answer the two questions:
1) which is the most unstable mode all over the k space
for the system investigated ? and 2) how shall this mode
shape the beam ? Following the guideline built by these
two questions, we assert that the so-called “ﬁlamenta-
tion” instability is not the fastest growing instability,
even in the relativistic regime, so that it is not the an-

swer to the ﬁrst question. As for the second question,
we shall see that this instability would not produce the
observed eﬀects anyway, even if it were the stronger one.
We shall conclude proposing a new “candidate” for beam
ﬁlamentation and comparing our predictions with the ex-
perimental results presented in [7]. For clarity, we shall
keep labelling the most unstable transverse mode with
wave vector normal to the beam as the “ﬁlamentation”
mode, though our point is precisely that it does not ﬁla-
ment.

Let us consider a beam of electrons (having mass me
and charge e) of density nb and relativistic velocity Vb
passing through a return current of plasma electrons of
density np, so that the system is unmagnetized. Both
beam and plasma are inﬁnite and homogenous and ions
are supposed to form a ﬁxed neutralizing background.
Let us deﬁne the ratio α = nb/np and introduce the
plasma frequency ωp = (4πnpe2/me)1/2. Here the beam
will be assumed to be cold in the longitudinal direc-
tion, which is correct provided the ratio of its longitu-
dinal thermal velocity Vtbk over the parallel phase veloc-
ity ωp/kk is small compared to α1/3. The ﬁlamentation
growth rate can then be evaluated in the weak beam den-
sity limit (α

Since δF decreases like γ−1/2
whereas δT S decreases like
γ−1
, the ﬁlamentation growth rate eventually exceeds the
b
two-stream one when the beam is relativistic. Compar-
ing ﬁlamentation growth rate with the Weibel one (trans-
verse waves with wave vector along the beam, as in [13]),
one ﬁnds ﬁlamentation to be also dominant so that it
eventually appears to be the largest instability [21].

However, this conclusion needs to be modiﬁed when ac-
counting for every other unstable modes with wave vector
neither normal nor parallel to the beam. Investigating
these modes demands a fully electromagnetic formalism
which is the only way to capture longitudinal modes (two-
stream) as well as transverse modes (Weibel and ﬁlamen-
tation). Indeed, such a procedure shows that two-stream
and ﬁlamentation modes pertain to the same branch of
the dispersion equation so that it is possible to switch
continuously from the former to the later by increasing
the angle θk between the beam and the wave vector from
0 to π/2. Consequently, the angle ϕk between the wave

vector and the electric ﬁeld of the mode (ϕk = (

tween longitudinal two-stream modes and transverse ﬁl-
amentation modes. In a recent paper [14], we began to
implement such an electromagnetic formalism using the
relativistic Vlasov equation to describe the evolution of
the electronic distribution function of the beam-plasma
system. Using some simple waterbag distribution func-
tions for the beam and the plasma, we investigated the
two-stream/ﬁlamentation (TSF) branch and found that
the growth rate reaches a maximum for an intermediate
orientation of the wave vector. This maximum scales like

It is noticeable that this result may be recovered under
the electrostatic longitudinal approximation [15]. Such
an approach cannot however sweep the whole k-plane.
Equation (3) shows that, even in the relativistic regime,
ﬁlamentation growth rate should not be the larger one.
On the contrary, this mixed two-stream ﬁlamentation
mode shall be all the more dominant over the usual ﬁl-
amentation mode that the beam is relativistic because
of its γb scaling. This trend ampliﬁes even more when
accounting for transverse beam temperature, since ﬁla-
mentation is damped [4, 16] while δM is almost unaﬀected
[16]. Therefore, one can say that the so-called ﬁlamenta-
tion instability may not be the fastest growing one.

Let us explore this further and move to our second
point by questioning on what ﬁlamentation instability
would do to the beam, if even it had the largest growth
rate. Within the linear approximation, one restricts

to small ﬂuctuations of the electron charge density.
ρ1 and E1 denote the ﬁrst order perturbations, respec-
tively, to the electron charge density and to the electric
ﬁeld, Poisson equation written in Fourier space brings
k
It comes directly from this
equation that a transverse mode with k
E1 = 0 has
ρ1(k, ω) = 0 and cannot yield density perturbations
within the limits of the linear regime. As a consequence,
the transverse ﬁlamentation instability with wave-vector
normal to the beam cannot yield any charge density ﬂuc-
tuations from the linear stage. It is important to note
that, for the same reasons, the original Weibel mode [13]
cannot linearly induce density ﬁlamentation either.

E1(k, ω) = 4πρ1(k, ω).

·

·

As far as beam ﬁlamentation is concerned, experi-
ments and simulations show that the electronic density
varies transversely to the beam, producing the ﬁlaments
[2, 5, 6, 7]. Now, if the electronic density varies while
background ions are (almost) at rest, there is neces-
sarily a net charge perturbation which precisely cannot
be accounted for by the mere exponential growth of a
purely transverse wave. It seems therefore that even if
it were the fastest growing instability, the so-called ﬁla-
mentation instability would not produce these ﬁlaments.
It is worth noticing that it could produce current ﬁl-
aments, for Maxwell’s equations allow such a wave to

produce such perturbations. But these current ﬁlaments
would have to preserve the neutrality of the system beam-
plasma, that is to preserve electronic density since ions
can be considered at rest.

Let us eventually determine which mode is responsible
for the observed ﬁlamentation. We shall see here that the
most natural candidate is the most unstable mode found
along the TSF branch. Being the fastest growing mode,
it is the one whose growth should “shape” the beam dur-
ing the linear phase while the other modes create ﬂuc-
tuations around this basic shape. As for its ability to
create ﬁlaments, it is quasi-longitudinal [14, 16] so that
its divergence does not vanish. This mode, unlike the so-
called ﬁlamentation mode, satisﬁes therefore the criteria
to induce ﬁlamentation: It is the fastest growing one, it
is microscopic in the transverse direction and it is two-
stream like, that is, quasi-longitudinal. Expressing the
density perturbation in terms of the wave electric ﬁeld
yields ρ1(k, ω) = kE1(k, ω) cos ϕk/4π, and one retrieves
the density perturbation in the real space through

this is the ﬁrst exact computation of TSF growth rates
in the whole k-space including beam and plasma tem-
peratures eﬀects. These curves clearly show that when
temperatures are accounted for they act to control the
instability domain, damping the small wavelengths per-
turbations along the ﬁlamentation direction (kk = 0) and
deforming the growth rates surface so that a maximum
growth rate appears for a ﬁnite oblique wave vector kM .
In this respect, Fig. 2(b) shows the drastic inﬂuence of
beam transverse temperature for a cold plasma. Yet, ev-
ery physical plasma has a ﬁnite bulk temperature and, for
α small enough, this plasma temperature can be shown
[16] to control essentially the maximum growth rate lo-
cation. Its (k⊥, kk) components are then

There are by now very few relevant experimental re-
sults available for quantitative comparisons with this re-
sult. We can consider Fig. 3 of Ref.
[7], where plasma
electronic density is about 1020 electrons/cm3. This
yields a plasma skin depth of about 53 µm while Fig.
3 scale indicates the transverse space between ﬁlaments
is somehow smaller. Indeed, the quantity Lf introduced
above is the skin depth times a π

23 µm which is in

good agreement with what is observed. Figure 3 displays
the right hand side of Eq. (6) for t = 1/ωp. Filaments
are clearly visible, combined with a beam segmentation

along the beam direction into segments πλsVb/c
long. This parallel segmentation may not be easily dis-
tinguishable on Fig. 3 of Ref.
[7] for its characteristic
length (more than 150 µm) is comparable to the size of
the entire picture.

Let us here brieﬂy discuss the applicability of our
study. As far as plasma (or beam) transverse temper-
atures are large enough, the above results should apply
to a ﬁnite system where the beam has a ﬁnite radial ex-
1 (see [18]
tension rb, the condition being that rbkM⊥ ≫
for ﬁlamentation instability in a ﬁnite size beam). As far
as FIS quantitative applications are concerned, the major
potential restriction of the present study is the fact that
the longitudinal beam temperature has been neglected.
Taking it into account would substantially increase its
diﬃculty as it would require a full kinetic treatment and
may render untractable the already demanding formal
computations used in Fig. 2. A useful discussion on the
onset of kinetic eﬀects and breakdown of the cold beam
hypothesis may be found in Refs. [19]. Besides, we used
there waterbag distributions which were simpler to tackle
than Maxwellian, but this should only aﬀect marginally
the quantitative results obtained.

Let us summarize our point as a conclusion. Relativis-
tic beam ﬁlamentation is an observed phenomena. It is
usually associated with the exponential growth of an un-
stable mode called “ﬁlamentation instability”. It turns
out that a thorough study of every unstable modes re-
veals that the “ﬁlamentation mode” should not be the

most unstable. Furthermore, this mode is purely trans-
verse and therefore unable to produce charge density per-
turbations. A better candidate to explain beam ﬁlamen-
tation is the most unstable mode all over the k space,
which turns to be intermediate between ﬁlamentation
and two-stream waves. Not only this mode appears to
be the fastest growing one, it is also quasi-longitudinal
so that it can perfectly induce charge density perturba-
tions. A simple evaluation of its growth shows how it
creates beam ﬁlaments within a few plasma periods and
agreement with experiment presented in [7] is found to be
correct. It sets the characteristic transverse and longitu-
dinal ﬁlamentation scales, at least during the linear ini-
tial stage when resistive (collisional) eﬀects are still neg-
ligible [18]. Finally, we wish to mention that our study
emphasizes the importance of quasi-longitudinal modes
in modelling ﬁlamentation which agrees with some con-
siderations recently put forward by Macchi et al.

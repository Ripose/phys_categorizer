Abstract. We have in earlier work (Basse N P 2005 Phys. Lett. A 340 456) reported
on intriguing similarities between density ﬂuctuation power versus wavenumber on
small (mm) and large (Mpc) scales.

In this paper we expand upon our previous studies of small and large scale

measurements made in fusion plasmas and using cosmological data, respectively.

The measurements are compared to predictions from classical ﬂuid turbulence
theory. Both small and large scale data can be ﬁtted to a functional form that is
consistent with the dissipation range of turbulence.

The comparable dependency of density ﬂuctuation power on wavenumber in fusion

plasmas and cosmology might indicate a common origin of these ﬂuctuations.

Density ﬂuctuations on mm and Mpc scales

1. Introduction

Transport of particles and energy across the conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld of fusion devices
is anomalous [1], i.e., it is much larger than the neoclassical transport level associated
with binary collisions in a toroidal geometry [2]. It is thought that anomalous transport
is caused by plasma turbulence, which in turn manifests itself as ﬂuctuations in most
plasma parameters. To understand anomalous transport, a two-pronged approach is
being applied:
(i) sophisticated diagnostics measure ﬂuctuations and (ii) advanced
simulations are being developed and compared to these measurements. Once our
understanding of the relationship between ﬂuctuation-induced anomalous transport and
plasma conﬁnement quality is more complete, we will be able to reduce transport due
to the identiﬁed mechanism(s).

The fusion plasma measurements presented in this paper are of ﬂuctuations in the
electron density. Small-angle collective scattering [3, 4] was used in the Wendelstein
7-AS (W7-AS) stellarator [5] and phase-contrast imaging (PCI) [6] is being used in the
Alcator C-Mod tokamak [7].

We speciﬁcally study density ﬂuctuation power versus wavenumber (also known
as the wavenumber spectrum) in W7-AS and C-Mod. These wavenumber spectra
characterize the nonlinear interaction between turbulent modes having diﬀerent length
scales.

The second part of our measurements, wavenumber spectra (i) of galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [8] and (ii) from a variety of sources (including the
SDSS data) are published in Ref. [9] and have been made available to us [10].

The paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we review our initial results from
Ref. [11]. Thereafter we analyze our expanded data set in section 3 and in response to
the results revise our treatment of the original W7-AS measurements in section 4. A
discussion follows in section 5 and we conclude in section 6.

2. Review of earlier ﬁndings

2.1. Stellarator fusion plasmas

P (k) ∝

× e−nk,

1
k

P (k) ∝ e−nk

In Ref. [11] we proposed that the density ﬂuctuation power P decreases exponentially
with increasing wavenumber k on mm scales in fusion plasmas according to

where n > 0 is a constant having a dimension of length and k = 2π/λ, where λ is the
corresponding wavelength. Initially we suggested the simpliﬁed form

in Ref. [12]. Eq. (2) also holds for density ﬂuctuations in the Tore Supra tokamak [13].

A wavenumber spectrum of turbulence in W7-AS is shown in Fig. 1. The measured

Density ﬂuctuations on mm and Mpc scales

points are shown along with two power-law ﬁts

P (k) ∝ k−m,

3

(3)

where m is a dimensionless constant. The power-law ﬁts are shown as solid lines and
an exponential ﬁt to Eq. (1) is shown as a dashed line.

All ﬁts shown in this paper have a normalized χ2 ≤ 1, ensuring the quality of the
ﬁts is good. The error bars are standard deviations and the semi-transparent rectangles
indicate which points are included to make the ﬁts.

The power-law ﬁts are motivated by classical ﬂuid turbulence theory where one
expects wavenumber spectra to exhibit power-law behavior with exponents m depending
on the dimension of the observed turbulence:

• 3D: Energy is injected at a large scale and redistributed (cascaded) by nonlinear
interactions down to a small dissipative scale. In this case, the energy spectrum in
the inertial range E(k) ∝ k−5/3 [14].

• 2D: Here, two power-laws exist on either side of the energy injection scale. For
smaller wavenumbers, the inverse energy cascade obeys E(k) ∝ k−5/3 and for larger
wavenumbers, the enstrophy cascade follows E(k) ∝ k−3 [15].

• 1D: Energy is injected at a large scale and dissipated at a small scale; E(k) ∝ k−2

Our measured power is equivalent to the d-dimensional energy spectrum Fd(k)

[16].

[17, 14, 18]

P (k) = Fd(k) =

E(k)
Ad

A1 = 2

A2 = 2πk

A3 = 4πk2,

(4)

where Ad is the surface area of a sphere having radius k and dimension d. Usually on
would assume that d = 2 in fusion plasmas, since transport along magnetic ﬁeld lines is
nearly instantaneous. The ﬁts to Eq. (3) in Fig. 1 yield exponents m = 3.0 ± 0.4 (small
wavenumbers) and 6.9 ± 0.7 (large wavenumbers). A similar behavior has previously
been reported in Ref.
[19] where it was speculated that the wavenumber value at the
transition between the two power-laws should correspond to a characteristic spatial scale
in the plasma. The only length scale close to the transitional value was found to be the
ion Larmor radius ρi.

The spectrum at small wavenumbers is roughly consistent with the inverse energy
cascade in 2D turbulence, F2(k) ∝ k−8/3. The exponent at large wavenumbers does not
ﬁt into this framework. However, for very large wavenumbers one enters the dissipation
range; here, it has been argued that the energy spectrum could have one of the following
dependencies

ENeumann(k) ∝ e−ak

EHeisenberg(k) ∝ k−7,

(5)

Density ﬂuctuations on mm and Mpc scales

4

where a > 0 is a constant having a dimension of length (see Ref.
[16] and references
therein). The energy spectrum proposed by J von Neumann was what initially inspired
us to investigate an exponential decay of P (k) in Ref. [12]. J von Neumann’s work on
this topic is from 1949 and two years later, A A Townsend published a more generalized
expression [20].

Fitting all wavenumbers to Eq. (1), ENeumann(k)/A2, we ﬁnd that n = 0.11 ± 0.004
cm or a wavenumber of 57.1 cm−1. Alternatively, the transitional wavenumber found
at the intersection between the two power-laws is 32.8 cm−1 (0.19 cm). The expression
EHeisenberg(k)/A2 yields m = 8, which is close to the experimental value m = 6.9 for
large wavenumbers. Calculating the ion Larmor radius at the electron temperature ρs
for this case we ﬁnd that it is 0.1 cm, i.e. the same order of magnitude as the spatial
scales found above. We used ρs instead of ρi because ion temperature measurements
were unavailable.

Currently we can think of three possible explanations for the behavior of the

wavenumber spectrum:

(i) We observe 2D turbulence and the transition between the two power-laws occurs at
a spatial scale where the inverse energy cascade develops into the dissipation range.
However, the enstrophy cascade is not accounted for in this case.

(ii) We observe 2D turbulence in the dissipation range described by Eq. (1) as proposed

by J von Neumann.

(iii) Turbulence theory does not apply. The transition between two power-laws or the
characteristic scale found using a single exponential function (Eq. (2)) indicates
that one scale dominates the turbulent dynamics in the wavenumber range studied.

In measurements of 2D ﬂuid turbulence, it has been demonstrated that the inverse
energy and forward enstrophy cascades merge into a single power-law when the system
transitions to being fully turbulent [21]. This might be the reason for the missing
enstrophy cascade discussed in item (i) above.

2.2. Cosmology

The shape of the wavenumber spectrum shown in Fig. 1 bears a striking resemblance
to measurements of ﬂuctuations in the distribution of galaxies presented in Ref. [9], see
Fig. 2. This motivates us to apply the analysis described in section 2.1 to the galaxy
data. In section 2.2.1 we brieﬂy put these measurements in context and then present
an analysis of the galaxy wavenumber spectrum in section 2.2.2.

2.2.1. Inﬂation Dramatic developments have taken place in cosmology over the last
decade, lending increasing support to the paradigm of inﬂation as an explanation for
what took place before the events described by the big bang theory [22]. Inﬂation solved
the so-called horizon and ﬂatness problems, but was at odds with earlier observations

Density ﬂuctuations on mm and Mpc scales

indicating that the ratio of the mass density of the universe to the critical value, the
density parameter Ω, was 0.2-0.3, while inﬂation predicted it should be 1:

Ω =

ρ
ρc

Ω < 1 : open

Ω = 1 : ﬂat

Ω > 1 : closed,

(6)

where ρc = 3H 2
0 /8πG is the critical mass density, H0 ≃ 70 km/s/Mpc is the Hubble
parameter observed today and G is I Newton’s gravitational constant [23]. However, new
measurements in the late 1990’s lead to a drastic modiﬁcation of Ω: Observations of type
Ia supernovae (SN) showed that the separation velocity between galaxies was speeding
up, not slowing down as would be expected for an open universe. The underlying
explanation for this accelerated expansion is not understood, but it seems that the
universe contains large quantities of negative pressure substance, creating a gravitational
repulsion driving the expansion. This negative pressure material is called dark energy,
the total density of dark energy ΩΛ is 0.7. The existence of dark energy is equivalent
to the cosmological constant Λ introduced by A Einstein. The dark matter density
Ωd is 0.25 and the baryonic matter density Ωb is 0.05, so the total density is very
close (or equal) to the critical density. The SN Ia data is supported by measurements
of nonuniformities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The CMB
anisotropy is due to the presence of tiny primordial density ﬂuctuations at the time of
recombination, where atoms formed. At that point in time the age of the universe was
about 400,000 years and the temperature was 3000 K. The structures observed in the
CMB are called acoustic peaks, and the simplest versions of inﬂation all reproduce these
structures quite accurately. The acoustic peaks can not be modelled by assuming that
the universe is open.

2.2.2. SDSS wavenumber spectrum A study of density ﬂuctuations on large scales
using 205,443 galaxies has been published by the SDSS Team in Ref.
[9], see Fig. 2.
3D maps of the universe are provided by the SDSS galaxy redshift survey, observing
about a quarter of the celestial sphere using a 2.5 m telescope and a charge-coupled
device (CCD) camera. The galaxies had a mean redshift z ≈ 0.1, corresponding to
light emitted 1-2 Gyr ago [23]. Fixing some cosmological parameters to Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite values [24] one ﬁnds - using physics
based models - that the wavenumber spectrum measurements were ﬁtted by a matter
density Ωm = Ωd+Ωb = 0.295±0.0323. In this case h = H0/(100 km/s/Mpc) = 0.72 was
assumed and it was observed that the wavenumber spectrum was not well characterized
by a single power-law.

A follow-up paper by the SDSS Team, Ref. [25], combined non-CMB measurements
(SDSS) with CMB measurements (WMAP) to constrain free parameters of cosmological
models and break CMB degeneracies in parameter space. This resulted in Ωm =

0.30 ± 0.04 and h = 0.70+0.04
only error bars on some parameters, e.g. the Hubble parameter and matter density.

−0.03. Adding the SDSS information more than halved WMAP-

The data presented in Fig. 2 has been taken from M Tegmark’s homepage [26].
According to the recommendation by the SDSS Team [9], the three largest wavenumbers
shown are not used in the ﬁts described in this section.

As we did for the W7-AS data in Section 2.1, we ﬁt the SDSS measurements to
two power-laws (Eq. (3)) or the exponential function with an algebraic pre-factor (Eq.
(1)). The power-law ﬁts are shown as solid lines, the exponential ﬁt as a dashed line.

The power-law ﬁts yield exponents m = 0.8 ± 0.03 (small wavenumbers) and 1.4 ±
0.1 (large wavenumbers). The wavenumber ranges were determined by minimizing the
combined χ2 of the ﬁts. As the SDSS Team found, a single power-law can not describe
the observations. The exponents are not close to the ones governing ﬂuid turbulence
discussed in section 2.1. The transitional wavenumber (power-law intersection) is 0.07
h Mpc−1, corresponding to a length of 89.8 h−1 Mpc.

We ﬁnd the characteristic length from Eq. (1) to be n = 2.3 ± 0.5 h−1 Mpc or a

wavenumber of 2.7 h Mpc−1.

3. Analysis of additional measurements

In Ref.
[11] we noted that both fusion plasma and cosmological wavenumber spectra
peak at small wavenumbers and decrease both above and below that peak. In this section
we analyze supplemental measurements on a wider range of scales. The fusion plasma
measurements were made in a tokamak, so our explicit assumption is that turbulence
in stellarators and tokamaks is comparable.

We ﬁt the data to a modiﬁed version of Eq. (1), namely

P (k) ∝

× e−nk,

1
kα

(7)

where α is brought in as an additional ﬁt parameter. The introduction of α is based
on the assumed functional form of the energy spectrum in the dissipation range of ﬂuid
turbulence [27]. Further, since we have no clear criteria for choosing between Eqs. (1)
and (2), leaving α to be ﬁtted will test our biased opinion in Ref. [11] for Eq. (1). Using
Eq. (4), Eq. (7) implies that E(k) ∝ k(d−1)−α × e−nk.

3.1. Tokamak fusion plasma

We analyze density ﬂuctuations at small wavenumbers in C-Mod using the PCI
diagnostic. Measurements in the low conﬁnement mode taken from Fig. 11 in Ref.
[28] are shown in Fig. 3. The dashed line shows the ﬁt made using Eq. (7) which yields
n = 0.11 ± 0.005 cm and α = 0.30 ± 0.02. The size of n is close to the value of ρs in
the given plasma.

3.2. Cosmological wavenumber spectrum

The expanded cosmological data set shown in Fig. 38 of Ref. [9] is re-plotted in Fig. 4.
These measurements have been provided by M Tegmark [10]. They are a combination of
the measured density ﬂuctuation power using several diagnostic techniques; the dashed
line is a ﬁt to a current model in cosmology, the so-called ”vanilla light” ﬂat adiabatic
ΛCDM model with negligible tilt, running tilt, tensor modes or massive neutrinos [9, 25].
During our analysis of the measurements it became obvious that Eq. (7) does not
ﬁt the entire range of wavenumbers above the peak of the spectrum. Therefore two ﬁts
were made:

• A small wavenumber ﬁt where the smallest wavenumber used is chosen to be the
one closest to (but larger than) the peak of the ΛCDM model shown in Fig. 4. The
largest wavenumber used is chosen so that χ2 of the ﬁt is 1. In Fig. 5 the ﬁt is
displayed as a dashed line. The parameters found are n = 13.3 ± 1.6 h−1 Mpc and
α = 0.24 ± 0.06. Note the interesting proximity of this α to the result in section
3.1.

• A large wavenumber ﬁt where the largest wavenumber used is the maximum of the
data set and the smallest wavenumber is chosen so that χ2 of the ﬁt is 1. In Fig.
6 the ﬁt is displayed as a dashed line. The parameters found are n = 0.33 ± 0.05
h−1 Mpc and α = 1.90 ± 0.05.

[0.08,
The wavenumbers not being used in either ﬁt deﬁne a transitional region:
0.10] h Mpc−1. This interval is in rough agreement with the transition found between
the two power-law ﬁts shown in Fig. 2.

4. Revised analysis of stellarator fusion plasmas

Based on the insights gained in section 3, we revisit the turbulence measurements made
in W7-AS, see Fig. 1. Our approach is to make three ﬁts, one for small, one for large
and one for all wavenumbers:

• For the ﬁt to small wavenumbers we use n and α found from the PCI measurements
in section 3.1 and only allow the overall amplitude to vary. The largest wavenumber
to be included in the ﬁt is chosen so that χ2 of the ﬁt is 1. Using this criterion the
four smallest wavenumbers are utilized. In Fig. 7 the ﬁt is shown as a dashed line.

• We allow all ﬁt parameters in Eq.

(7) to vary for the ﬁt to the four largest
wavenumbers and show the resulting ﬁt as a dashed line in Fig. 8. The ﬁt yields
n = 0.14 ± 0.008 cm and α = 0.25 ± 0.1. This ﬁt is also good for the entire
wavenumber range: Using the found parameters, χ2 remains less than 1 for all
eight wavenumbers.

• Fit to Eq. (7) using all eight wavenumbers and allowing every ﬁt parameter to
vary. The ﬁt yields n = 0.14 ± 0.007 cm and α = 0.11 ± 0.2, which is consistent
with a pure exponential function (Eq. (2)).

Density ﬂuctuations on mm and Mpc scales

8

The amplitude-only ﬁt using PCI parameters indicates a transition at the center
of the data set, whereas the two other ﬁts suggest that the data is consistent with a
continuous behavior. It is apparent that additional measurements at large wavenumbers
in fusion plasmas are needed to gain conﬁdence in the ﬁts. Some of the existing points
might be in a transitional region akin to the one found in the cosmological data.

5. Discussion

The fact that density ﬂuctuations on small (fusion plasmas) and large (cosmological)
scales can be described by an exponential
function with an algebraic pre-factor,
Eq.
(7), might indicate that plasma turbulence at early times has been expanded
to cosmological proportions. A natural consequence of that thought would be to
investigate ﬂuctuations in quark-gluon plasmas (QGPs) corresponding to even earlier
times. However, experimental techniques to do this are not suﬃciently developed at the
moment due to the extreme nature of QGPs. It has been suggested that complex (or
dusty) plasmas could be used as a model of QGPs [29].

It is fascinating that wavenumber spectra over wider scales peak at small
wavenumbers and decrease both above and below that peak. This is seen both in
fusion plasmas and on cosmological scales, compare Figs. 3 and 4. Turbulence theory
in 1D or 3D would interpret the peak position as the scale where energy is injected.

Fitting wavenumber spectra to power-laws as we did in section 2 is based on ﬂuid
turbulence theories, but in general care must be taken when interpreting the outcome:
We know that an exponential function can be Taylor expanded to a Maclaurin series

P (k) ∝ e−nk =

∞

X
i=0

(−nk)i
i!

.

(8)

So locally, i.e. for a small range of wavenumbers, an exponential dependency can
be masked as a power-law; the exponent would vary as a function of the wavenumber
range selected. To some extent this objection also holds true for our results using
Eq.
It is
(7) to identify two wavenumber intervals having diﬀerent ﬁt parameters.
an open question whether an extension of the cosmological data to larger wavenumbers
would necessitate further intervals. However, in ﬂuid turbulence simulations a transition
between near- and far-dissipation similar to the one we discuss has been identiﬁed [30].
This observation lends support to the interpretation that our dual ﬁts describe diﬀerent
types of dissipation.

To sum up, we favor Eq. (7) as a descriptor of the data, both for fusion plasma and
cosmological measurements. Perhaps forcing occurs at a large scale where the spectra
peak and transitions directly to dissipation. The fact that we obtain n ≃ ρs using Eq.
(7) for fusion plasmas suggests that n is the characteristic scale of turbulence.

We would like to point out that observations of electric ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in the solar
wind are found to be proportional to exp(−kρi/12.5) for kρi > 2.5 [31]. It should be
noted that the electric ﬁeld measurements at these large wavenumbers are noisy. Work
on the solar wind data to analyze density ﬂuctuations is in progress [32].

6. Conclusions

We have in this paper reported on suggestive similarities between density ﬂuctuation
power versus wavenumber on small (mm) and large (Mpc) scales.

The small scale measurements were made in fusion plasmas and compared to
predictions from turbulence theory. The data sets ﬁt Eq. (7), which has a functional
form that can be explained as dissipation by turbulence theory. The large scale
cosmological measurements can also be described by Eq.
In general, two
(7).
wavenumber ranges separated by a transitional region are identiﬁed.

The similar dependency of density ﬂuctuation power on wavenumber might indicate
a common origin of these ﬂuctuations, perhaps from ﬂuctuations in QGPs at early stages
in the formation of the universe. The value of α is almost identical for both fusion
plasma and cosmological measurements at wavenumbers close to but above the peak of
the spectra.

To progress further, it is essential that the quantity of wavenumber-resolved fusion

plasma turbulence measurements is vastly increased.

The fermionic exchange energy of ultracold ions is com-
puted. It is shown that this eﬀect allows to increase the ion
coupling in traps by about an order of magnitude compared
to the classical case.

In this Comment we analyze the prospects of produc-
ing a strongly coupled ion plasma by laser ionization of
an ultracold gas. A recent Letter [1] suggested that the
Fermionic exchange of the ensemble of atoms (before ion-
ization) would allow to increase the ionic coupling dras-
tically. While this general idea is correct, we show that
the predicted “orders of magnitude” eﬀect may only ap-
pear in a transient regime. For the ﬁnite state coupling
an upper bound is derived which is much lower.

Ref.

[1] assumes

ionization the elec-
that after
trons equilibrate instantaneously whereas the ions form
a one-component plasma with a statically screened
Coulomb interaction (screening parameter κ = 1/rD =
4πnee2/kTe determined by the electrons). Initially ion
equilibration proceeds under isolated conditions, i.e. to-
p
tal energy E remains constant

E(t) ≡ K(t) + UF (t) + U (t) = K0 + UF 0 + U0 ≡ E0. (1)

Here, K, UF and U are, respectively, the kinetic, ex-
change (mean ﬁeld or Fock) and correlation energy of
the ions, and “0” denotes the initial state.

If the initial state is uncorrelated, UF 0 = U0 = 0, the
system is heating up [2], K(t) ≥ K0, as a consequence of
growing attractive (negative) correlation energy, U (t) <
0. Ref. [1] suggested to use ionic exchange, UF 0 < 0 to
reduce the heating. This is reasonable since atom cooling
below the Fermi temperature has already been achieved
experimentally [3].

For a homogeneous plasma, the ﬁnal state tempera-
ture T or coupling Γ ≡ Uc/kBT (Uc = e2/a is the mean
Coulomb energy and a the mean interparticle distance),
can be estimated from Eq. (1) by setting U0 → 0,

where the r.h.s. is the ﬁnal state correlation energy U (in

and κ = 4.5/a [1]. Note that the Fock energy UF 0 dif-
fers from the familiar exchange energy as it involves the
screened interaction instead of the Coulomb potential
and is computed numerically. For the initial tempera-
ture T0 we choose 300nK (corresponding to T = 0.5TF
of ions in a trap [3]) and 6.6nK (T = 0.5TF in a homoge-
neous system studied in [1]). The highest possible eﬀect
can be estimated from the limit T0 → 0 for which the
exchange energy can be found analytically,

FIG. 1. Graphical solution of Eq. (2). The ﬁnal state Γ
is obtained as the crossing of the full line [r.h.s. of Eq. (2)]
and one of the decreasing curves [l.h.s. of Eq. (2)] for varying
initial temperature and spin polarization.

Our analysis reveals that the ﬁnal state Γ indeed in-
creases due to exchange eﬀects, from 17 (without cor-
relations) up to Γ ≃ 140, for T0 = 0 and spin polarized
ions, cf. Fig. 1. To achieve this, in homogeneous systems,
requires temperatures below 10nK whereas, in traps, sev-
eral 100nK should be suﬃcient.

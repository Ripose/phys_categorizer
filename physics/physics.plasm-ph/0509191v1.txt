Highly Charged Ions in a Weakly Coupled Plasma:
An Exact Solution

(Dated: December 21, 2013)

The ion sphere model introduced long ago by Salpeter is placed in a rigorous theoretical setting.
The leading corrections to this model for very highly charged but dilute ions in thermal equilibrium
with a weakly coupled, one-component background plasma are explicitly computed, and the sub-
leading corrections shown to be negligibly small. Such analytic results for very strong coupling are
rarely available, and they can serve as benchmarks for testing computer models in this limit.

PACS numbers: 05.20.-y, 11.10.Wx, 52.25.-b

Here we shall describe a plasma conﬁguration that is of
considerable interest: very dilute “impurity” ions of very
high charge Zpe, Zp ≫ 1, in thermal equilibrium with a
classical, one-component “background” plasma of charge
ze and number density n, at temperature T = 1/β. The
background plasma is neutralized in the usual way, and
it is weakly coupled. We use rationalized electrostatic
units and measure temperature in energy units so that
the background plasma Debye wave number appears as
κ2
D = β (ze)2 n. The weak coupling of the background
plasma is conveyed by g ≪ 1, where g = (ze)2 κD/(4π T ).
Although the background plasma coupling to itself is as-
sumed to be very weak and the impurity ions are assumed
to be so very dilute that their internal interactions are
also very small, we shall require that the ionic charge
Zp is so great that the coupling between the impurity
ions and the background plasma is large, gZp ≫ 1. This
strongly coupled system is interesting from a theoreti-
cal point of view and our results can be used to check
numerical methods.

This limit can be solved exactly. The solution is given
by the ion sphere result presented by Salpeter [1] plus a
simple smaller correction. This is accomplished by using
the eﬀective plasma ﬁeld theory methods advocated by
Brown and Yaﬀe [2]. In this ﬁeld-theory language, the
old Salpeter result corresponds to the tree approximation
and our new correction is the one-loop term.

In usual perturbative expansions, the tree approxima-
tion provides the ﬁrst, lowest-order term. Here, on the
contrary, the tree approximation provides the leading
term for strong coupling, with the corrections of higher
order in the inverse coupling. This is the only example
of which we are aware in which the tree approximation
yields the strong coupling limit.

Standard methods express the grand canonical parti-
tion function in terms of functional integrals. Brown and
Yaﬀe [2] do this, introduce an auxiliary scalar electro-
static potential, and (formally) integrate out the charged
particle ﬁelds to obtain the eﬀective theory. The sad-
dle point expansion of this form for the grand partition

function yields a perturbative expansion, with the tree
approximation providing the lowest-order term. Here,
on the contrary, we express the impurity ion number in
terms of an eﬀective ﬁeld theory realized by a functional
integral. This corresponds to a mixed thermal ensemble
in which the very dilute impurity ions are represented
by a canonical ensemble, with the remaining background
plasma described by a grand canonical ensemble. The
saddle point of this form of the functional integral in-
volves a classical ﬁeld solution driven by a strong point
charge.

The result for the impurity ion number reads

Here N (0)
p ∼ exp{βµp} is the the number of impurity
ions deﬁned by the chemical potential µp in the absence
of the background plasma; keeping this chemical poten-
tial ﬁxed, the background plasma alters this number to
be Np. The ﬁnal −gZp/3 term in the exponent is the
relatively small one-loop correction. The added · · · rep-
resent corrections to the evaluation of the classical action
that may or may not be signiﬁcant — if needed, they may
be obtained numerically. The constant C = 0.8498 · · · .

The number correction (1) can be used to construct the
grand canonical partition function Z for the combined
system by integrating the generic relation N = ∂
∂βµ ln Z .
The equation of state is then determined from pV = ln Z.
To simply bring out the main point, we include here only
the leading terms,

Although the fraction of impurity ions in the plasma

carries the charge (Z1 + Z2)e. Thus

The ﬁrst line agrees with the calculation of Salpeter

We turn now to sketch the basis for these results. The

The normalizing partition function Z is the same func-
tional integral except that the point source δ function
term is removed from the eﬀective action (6). The terms
subtracted from the exponential in the action (6) remove
an overall number contribution and account for the ef-
fect of the rigid neutralizing background. As described
in Brown and Yaﬀe [2], one can establish this result by
expanding the exponential in powers of the number den-
sity n and performing the resulting Gaussian functional
integrals to get the usual statistical mechanical form.

The loop expansion is an expansion about the saddle
point of the functional integral. At this point, the action
S[χ] is stationary, and the ﬁeld χ obeys the classical ﬁeld
equation. The tree approximation is given by evaluating
S[iφcl(r)], where φcl(r) obeys the classical ﬁeld equation

automatically produced by our formalism and prove that
higher-order corrections may be neglected.

The one-loop correction to this ﬁrst tree approximation
is obtained by writing the functional integration variable
as χ(r) = iφcl(r) + χ′(r) , and expanding the total action
in Eq. (5) to quadratic order in the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld χ′.
Since iφcl obeys the classical ﬁeld equation, there are no
linear terms in χ′. The leading quadratic terms deﬁne
a Gaussian functional integral that produces a Fredholm
determinant. Hence, to tree plus one-loop order,

To solve the classical ﬁeld equation (7) in the large Zp
limit, we note that φcl must vanish asymptotically, hence
Eq. (7) reduces at large distances to the Debye form and
thus, for |r| large,

φcl(r) ≃ (const)

(9)

The coordinate integral of ∇2φcl vanishes by Gauss’ the-
orem, and from Eq. (7) we obtain the integral constraint

For small |r|, the point source driving term in the clas-
sical ﬁeld equation dominates, giving the Coulomb po-
tential solution. Thus we write

φcl(r) =

u(ξ) ,

Zpe
4π r

(11)

where ξ = κr , and the point driving charge Zpe is now
conveyed in the boundary condition u(0) = 1 . The large
r limit (9) requires that u(ξ) ∼ e− ξ for large ξ.

To compute the action corresponding to the classical
solution, we must ﬁrst regularize it and remove the vac-
uum self energy of the impurity ion. It is not diﬃcult to
show that this gives, on changing variables to ξ = κr,

This equation is of the familiar Debye-Huckle form. We
have placed it in the context of a systematic perturbative
expansion in which the error of omitted terms can be
ascertained. We shall describe the one-loop correction

according to the variation of Eq. (12).

In our large Zp limit, the short distance form of
Eq. (11) (multiplied by βze) is large over a wide range of
|r|, and exp{−βzeφcl(r)} is quite small there, leading to

The nature of this “ion-sphere” solution u0(ξ) together
with the exact solution u(ξ) obtained by the numerical
integration of Eq. (13), as well as the ﬁrst correction de-
scribed below, are displayed in Fig. 1.

(cid:3)

We have appended the subscript 0 to indicate that this
is the solution for the ion sphere model. Placing this
solution in the new version (12) of the action gives

−S0 [iφcl] =

(3gZp)2/3 − Zp .

(16)

To ﬁnd the leading correction, we ﬁrst write the full
solution u(ξ) as u(ξ) = u0(ξ)+(ξ0/Zpg) v(ξ), where u0(ξ)
is the solution (15) to the ion sphere model. The exact
diﬀerential equation (13) now reads

Since u0(0) = 1 and since the solution must vanish at
inﬁnity, the proper solution to Eq. (17) obeys v(0) = 0 ,
and v(ξ) → 0 for ξ → ∞. Some algebra yields

Thus far we have made no approximations. To obtain
the leading correction to the ion sphere result, we note
that the factor exp {−(gZp/ξ) u0(ξ)} is very small for
ξ < ξ0, and so it may be evaluated by expanding u0(ξ)
about ξ = ξ0. Using Eq. (15), the leading terms yield

(cid:26)
This approximation is valid for all ξ because when ξ is
smaller than ξ0 and our expansion breaks down, the ar-
gument in the exponent is so large that the exponential
function essentially vanishes. Since we consider the limit
in which ξ0 is taken to be very large and the Gaussian
contribution is very narrow on the scale set by ξ0, we
may approximate

Here the delta function accounts for the little piece of area
that the Gaussian provides near the ion sphere radius.
One may verify that, with this approximation inserted
into Eq. (17), the leading solution is given for ξ < ξ0 by
v1(ξ) = c1 ξ , where c1 is a constant that is yet to be
determined, while

ξ > ξ0 :

d2v1(ξ)
dξ2 = 1 − e−v1(ξ) .

(20)

This diﬀerential equation is akin to a one-dimensional
equation of motion of a particle with ξ playing the role
of time, and v1(ξ) playing the role of position. Thus there
is the usual “energy constant of motion”. The integra-
tion constant is ﬁxed by requiring that v1(ξ) vanishes at
inﬁnity. Then choosing the proper root to ensure that
asymptotically v1(ξ) decreases when ξ increases gives

(cid:2)

The diﬀerent functional forms for v1(ξ) in the two re-
gions ξ < ξ0 and ξ > ξ0 are joined by the continuity
constraint c1 ξ0 = v1(ξ0) , and a slope jump to produce
the δ function introduced by Eq. (19). This requires

For ξ0 ≫ 1, the second term on the right-hand may be
neglected, giving v1(ξ0) = 0.6967 · · · .

We now evaluate the leading correction in the action
(18).
In computing the leading term we can set ξ =
ξ0 in the integral that is linear in v1(ξ). The leading
correction is given by Sreg[iφcl] ≃ S0[iφcl] + S1 , in which

Here we have omitted a part that is of the negligible
relative order 1/ξ0. We change variables from ξ to v1
and use the result (21) for the derivative to get simple

We assume that the charge Zp of the “impurity” ions is
so large that not only Zp ≫ 1, but also gZp ≫ 1 as well,
even though we require that g ≪ 1. Then κr0 ≫ 1, and
the ion sphere radius r0 is large in comparison to the
characteristic distance scale for spatial variation in the
background plasma, the Debye length κ−1. In this case,
the term κ2 exp {−βzeφ(r)} in the one-loop determinant
Det−1/2
in Eq. (8) can be treated as
being very slowly varying — essentially a constant —
(cid:3)
except when it appears in a ﬁnal volume integral akin to

This result is physically obvious. The impurity ion
carves out a hole of radius r0 in the original, background
plasma. The original, background plasma is unchanged
outside this hole. The corrections that smooth out the
sharp boundaries in this picture only produce higher-
order terms. The original, background plasma had a
vanishing electrostatic potential everywhere, and the po-
tential in the ion sphere picture vanishes outside the
sphere of radius r0. The grand potential of the back-
ground plasma is now reduced by the amount originally
contained within the sphere of radius r0, and this is ex-
actly what is stated to one-loop order in Eq.(26).

This argument carries on to the higher loop terms as
well. As shown in detail in the paper of Brown and Yaﬀe
[2], n-loop terms in the expansion of the background
plasma partition function with no impurities present in-
volve a factor of κ2 κn which combines with other factors

With the very high Zp impurity ions present, each factor
of κ is accompanied by exp{−(1/2)βze φcl(r)} whose spa-
tial variation can be neglected except in the ﬁnal volume
integral. Thus, an n-loop term is of order

Since we assume that g is suﬃciently small that g2 Zp ≪
1 (even though gZp ≫ 1), all the higher loop terms may
be neglected [5].

We have now established the results quoted above.

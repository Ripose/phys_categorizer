Abstract

The energy loss by a test gyratory particle in a cold plasma in the presence
of homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is considered. Analytical and numerical results
for the rate of energy loss are presented. This is done for strong and weak ﬁelds
(i. e., when the electron cyclotron frequency is either higher, or smaller than
the plasma frequency), and in case, when the test particle velocity is greater
than the electron thermal velocity. It is shown that the rate of energy loss may
be much higher than in the case of motion through plasma in the absence of
magnetic ﬁeld.

The energy loss of fast charged particles in a plasma has been a topic of great
interest since the 1950s because of its considerable importance for the study of
the basic interactions of charged particles in real media; moreover, recently, it
has also become a great concern in connection with heavy-ion driven inertial
fusion research [1, 2].

The nature of experimental plasma physics is such that experiments are
usually performed in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds, and consequently, it is of
interest to investigate the eﬀects of a magnetic ﬁeld on the rate of energy loss.
The stopping of charged particles in a magnetized plasma has been the
subject of several papers [3-6]. The stopping of a fast test particle moving with
a velocity v much higher than the electron thermal velocity vT was studied in
refs. [3, 5]. The energy loss of a charged particle moving with arbitrary velocity
was studied in [4]. The expression derived there for the Coulomb logarithm
corresponds to the classical description of collisions.

In ref.

[6] expressions were derived describing the stopping power of a
slow charged particle in Maxwellian plasma with a classically strong (but not
quantizing) magnetic ﬁeld, under conditions such that the scattering processes
must be described quantum-mechanically.

In the present paper we consider the rate of energy loss of a nonrelativistic
gyratory charged particle in a magnetized cold plasma. Also, this problem is
important for the construction of models of X-ray pulsars [7] and the study of
processes in the atmospheres of magnetic white dwarfs the magnetic ﬁelds on
the surfaces of which can attain strengths of 105 − 1010kG.

A uniform plasma is considered in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld B0 (directed in the positive z-direction) which is assumed suﬃciently small
so that λB ≪ ac (where λB and ac are respectively the electron de Broglie
wavelength and Larmor radius). From these conditions we can obtain B0 <
105T (T is the plasma temperature), where T is measured in eV and B0 in
kG. Also, due to the high frequencies involved, the very weak response of the
plasma ions is neglected and the Vlasov-Poisson equations to be solved for the
perturbation to the electron distribution function and the scalar potential ϕ.

The rate of energy loss S of a plasma against a fast charge is deﬁned by
the energy loss of the charge in a unit time due to interactions with the plasma
(1) it is straightforward to calculate the electric ﬁeld
electrons. From eq.
E = −∇ϕ, and the stopping force acting on the particle. Then, the rate of
energy loss of the test particle becomes

P (ω) = h(ω)/ε(ω), Jn(x) is the nth order Bessel function and s = kmaxa with
kmax = 1/rmin = 2mv/¯h, where rmin is the eﬀective minimum impact param-
eter. Here kmax has been introduced to avoid the divergence of the integral
caused by the incorrect treatment of the short-range interactions between the
test particle and the plasma electrons within the linearized Vlasov theory.

The function Qn(s) is exponentially small at n > s. Therefore the series
in the eq. (5) is cut at nmax ≃ s and the rate of energy loss is determined by
harmonics with n < nmax.

Consider now the eq. (5) for strong and weak magnetic ﬁelds. In the case of
weak magnetic ﬁeld (Ωc < υ) one may substitute the summation in expression
(5) by integration in ω = nΩc. Since also Qn(s) ≃ ln(s/n) when s > n, in the
limit Ωc → 0 the eq. (5) is transformed into a known Bohr’s expression.

Consider the case of strong magnetic ﬁeld and let be non-integer. In this

case, from eq. (5) we ﬁnd:

From eq. (8) it follows, that energy loss decreases inversely proportional to the
magnetic ﬁeld. In the case when c = 1 (electron test particle), from eq. (5) we
ﬁnd:

These examples of asymptotic dependence of energy loss rate on the value
of magnetic ﬁeld show strong dependence of energy loss on mass of the test
particle.

From the eq. (5) it is straightforward to trace qualitatively the behavior
of energy loss rate as a function of magnetic ﬁeld in the general case. Note,
(5) that the rate of energy loss is maximal for those
as it follows from eq.
values of magnetic ﬁeld for which ε(nΩc) has small values. The small ε(nΩc)
means, that in the dependence of energy loss from magnetic ﬁelds, maximums
at integer values of parameter b = ωp/Ωc can be observed. It corresponds to the
case, when on test particle’s Larmor orbit includes integer number of plasma
oscillation wavelengths (λp = 2πv/ωp).

Fig.1 shows the ratio R = S/SB (where SB is the well-known Bohr result
[8]) as a function of parameter b in two cases; for electron test particle (dotted
line), and for proton test particle (solid line). The plasma-particle parameters
are: υ/ωp = 0.01, n0 = 1018cm−3, T = 100eV and v/vT = 10. As it follows
from Fig.1, the rate of energy loss oscillates as a function of magnetic ﬁeld and
many times exceeds the usual Bohr losses of energy.

Abstract— Results obtained from experimental and numerical
studies of tungsten wires electrical explosion in vacuum are pre-
sented. The experiments were performed both with and without
preheating of the wires, using positive or negative polarity of a
high-voltage electrode. Preheating is shown to increase energy
deposition in the wire core due to a longer resistive heating
stage. The effect was observed both in single wire and wire array
experiments. The evolution of the phase state of the wire material
during explosion was examined by means of one-dimensional
numerical simulation using a semiempirical wide-range equation
of state describing the properties of tungsten with allowance made
for melting and vaporization.

tion, tungsten, wire array.

I. INTRODUCTION

E LECTRICAL explosion of metal wire arrays is the basis

for production of high-power pulsed soft x-ray radiation
in wire array implosion experiments [1]–[3]. In experiments
of this kind, the x-ray power depends, among other factors, on
the time of the wire material transition from a solid to a gas-
plasma state. In actual situations, a shunting breakdown of the
electrode gap impedes complete wire vaporization (see, e.g.,
papers [4], [5] and references therein). After the breakdown,
a low-density corona is generated around the wires. Part of
the current is carried through the corona plasma accelerated
toward the axis of the system as jets formed from each wire
[2], [6]. In this way, a rareﬁed hot plasma retarding wire array
implosion is formed long before the bulk of the wire array
material arrives at the axis of the system. Moreover, part of
the wire array mass is never involved in implosion and remains
at the periphery, with part of the current from the generator
also ﬂowing through the residual plasma [7]. From this it
follows that the development of the shunting breakdown must
be retarded to improve the wire array implosion dynamics.

II. EXPERIMENT AND SIMULATION

We have investigated ﬁne wire explosion, using positive or
negative polarity of the high-voltage electrode of a current
generator. Emphasis was placed on elucidation of the causes
of the shunting discharge along an electrically exploded ﬁne
wire.

The experiments were carried out on the current generator
described previously [8]. Capacitance and inductance of the
generator are 70 nF and 730 nH correspondingly. In the
experiments under consideration, tungsten wires 30.5 µm in
diameter and 20 ± 0.5 mm in length were exploded.

Use was made of the following electrophysical diagnostics:
a resistive divider, a shunt placed on the ground electrode
side, and a bare x-ray vacuum diode with an aluminum
photocathode. The bandwidth of the resistive divider and the
current shunt is not worse than 300 MHz. A framing camera
was used for optical diagnostics. The camera was gated by a
voltage pulse from the high voltage electrode. The exposure
time was determined by the interval, during which the voltage
across the anode–cathode gap was 7 kV and higher. The gated
pulse from the high voltage electrode to the framing camera
was delayed on the time ∆t, which depends on the length of
a cable connecting the high voltage electrode and the framing
camera. This enabled us to record the onset of the electrode
gap breakdown and to cut off bright light ﬂashes inherent in
the arc phase of the shunting discharge. The system has an
undoubted beneﬁt of automatic synchronization of the framing
camera operation with the wire explosion.

The experiments were carried out in four wire explosion
modes, which were determined by the polarity of the high-
voltage electrode and the use of wire preheating: mode A —
the high-voltage electrode served as a cathode, U0 = 10, 20
or 30 kV, no wire preheating; mode B — the high-voltage
electrode served as an anode, U0 = 10, 20 or 35 kV, no wire
preheating; mode C — the high-voltage electrode served as a
cathode, U0 = 10 or 30 kV, a wire was preheated; mode D
— the high-voltage electrode served as an anode, U0 = 10
or 35 kV, a wire was preheated. Here, U0 is the capacitor
charging voltage. The wire was preheated to T0 = 1.4–1.6 kK
maintained for one hour, using a direct current of 150 mA.
Because heating was not switched off during the explosion, the
heater supply circuit was protected by a 1.1 mH inductance.

Figures 1 and 2 show current, voltage, energy deposition,
and resistance waveforms obtained in the experiments where
a maximum peak voltage across the wire was recorded in
different electrical explosion modes. Calculation of the de-
posited energy (see Fig. 1c and 2c) was stopped when the
resistive voltage of the cathode–anode gap drops two times
from its maximum value. As it was already demonstrated
experientially in [9], [10], the polarity of the high-voltage
electrode has a profound effect on energy deposition in the
wire. It is evident from the oscillograms presented in Fig. 1
that it takes much less time to produce a breakdown along
a wire in the case of negative polarity of the high-voltage
electrode than of positive polarity. Figure 2 shows similar
oscillograms taken during a preheated wire explosion. It is
obvious that the polarity of the high-voltage electrode has only
a marginal effect in those experiments. This fact testiﬁes that
surface impurities and desorbed gases play a key role in the
formation of the breakdown along the wire responsible for a
lower energy deposited in the wire core. To visualize spread
in the experimental data, we demonstrate generalized results
as a maximum and a minimum resistance of a tungsten wire
30.5 µm in diameter in relation to energy deposition (Fig. 3).
A minimum spread in the experimental data is observed in the
case of negative polarity of the high-voltage electrode without
wire preheating.

Analysis of the results obtained from wire explosion exper-
iments without preheating for different polarities of the high-
voltage electrode (modes A and B) shows that positive polarity
provides higher energy deposition than negative polarity. A
comparison of the results for modes C and D suggests that
there is a minor difference in energy deposition.

Judging by the framing camera images, we may conclude
that the duration of the pre-breakdown phase depends on spe-
cial features of plasma formation in the near-cathode region.
For positive polarity of the high-voltage electrode (cathode
serves as the ground electrode), an emission center strongly
connected with the development of the breakdown emerges
on the wire surface ∼ 3 mm far from the cathode (Fig. 4a).
Light emission from this center becomes much brighter than
that from the wire 25 ns after the breakdown (Fig. 4b), light
emission from the surface of the electrodes being not observed.
For negative polarity of the high-voltage electrode, breakdown
is strongly connected with an emergence of emission centers
immediately on the cathode surface (Fig. 5a, b) and with
an uniform high-intensity light emission region on the wire
surface ∼ 4–6 mm far from the cathode. The number of
emission centers on the cathode may vary from shot to shot.
Early in the breakdown process, the emission centers formed
on the end face of the cathode occupy the entire surface of
the high-voltage electrode in the course of time. Uniform high-
intensity light emission on the electrode surface is observed
from the anode side (ground electrode), as shown in Fig. 5c.
We have looked at the characteristics of individual wires
in an electrically exploded 12 mm wire array comprising
9 tungsten wires 30.5 µm in diameter. The wire array was
exploded for negative polarity of the high-voltage electrode
with U0 = 20 kV. Both initially cold (room-temperature) and
preheated wire arrays were used. The wires were preheated to

a temperature of T0 = 1.8 kK maintained for one hour.

The initial resistance of a preheated wire array is much
higher than that of a cold one. Since the current generator is
started up at varying initial load resistance and is operated in
different modes, a comparative analysis of the oscillograms
of current and voltage waveforms is difﬁcult to perform. It is
much more convenient to consider the resistance of individual
wires in an array as a function of energy deposition (RW dia-
gram). Figure 6 illustrates variations of the resistance per unit
length of an individual wire in an array with energy deposition
in the wire. In a preheated wire array, the initial resistance of
an individual wire was 6.9 Ohm, which corresponded to an
initial wire temperature of 1.8 kK and deposited energy of
0.25 mJ/µg. Hence, the plot for a preheated wire given in
Fig. 6 begins with these data point. The results cited lead us
to conclude that for negative polarity the energy deposited in
a preheated wire array is somewhat higher than in a cold wire
array. This conclusion is supported by the experimental fact
that the cold wire array was either unaffected by exposure to
generator current or only one wire of the array was burnt out.
In the preheated wire array, current ﬂow through the wire load
caused destruction of all wires. The maximum resistance was
1.3–1.4 times larger for the preheated wire array than for the
originally cold one. This is also evidence of an increase in the
energy deposited both in individual wires and in the whole
wire array. It should be noted that when the generator current
is passed through a cold wire array, the onset of the shunting
breakdown (see Fig. 6) corresponds to the lower bound of
statistical spread of the curves in the RW diagram for an
individual wire (see Fig. 3a).

We have calculated the resistive stage of the electrical
explosion of a tungsten wire using experimental current wave-
form and breakdown time within a one-dimensional magneto-
hydrodynamic model following the computational procedure
described in [12]. The thermodynamic properties of tungsten
were determined using a wide-range multi-phase equation of
state [13] in tabulated form [14]. The electrical conductivity
was approximated by a semiempirical relation [15]. The wire
preheating level was assumed to be the same in explosion
modes C and D with the wire temperature being T0 = 1.6 kK.
Figure 7 shows results of numerical calculations for the initial
explosion phase in different wire explosion modes.

According to experimental data, we can say that the time of
shunting breakdown is delayed by τ1 ∼ 40 ns in the case of
negative polarity of the high-voltage electrode and a preheated
wire with U0 = 10 kV as compared to the results obtained
from the cold wire experiments. According to our numerical
calculations the preheated wire temperature immediately prior
to the breakdown was estimated to be higher by ∆Ta ∼ 1 kK
than that of the cold wire. For positive polarity, both the delay
in the breakdown and further increase in temperature were
smaller than for negative polarity: τ2 ∼ 10 ns and ∆Ta ∼
0.4 kK (in this case, part of the energy deposited in a wire
was spent for melting). In explosion modes with faster energy
deposition (U0 = 30 kV or 35 kV) the delay depends only
weakly on polarity, τ3 ∼ 10 ns. In preheated wire explosion
modes, the wires are melted completely and, what is more, are
heated further up to T ∼ 8 kK thereafter with ∆Ta ∼ 4 kK.

For negative polarity, breakdown is strongly connected with
an emergence of emission centers on the cathode surface
and with an uniform high-intensity light emission region
on the wire surface ∼ 4–6 mm far from the cathode. For
positive polarity, an emission center strongly connected with
the development of the breakdown appears on the wire surface
∼ 3 mm far from the cathode.

The speciﬁc characteristics of the electrical explosion of ﬁne
wires in a wire array are identical to those of the explosion
of a single wire. Preheating enables the wire array implosion
dynamics to be changed and the fraction of high-energy
radiation from a wire array to be increased.

Experimental results reported in [16], [17] also point to the
fact that preheating enables a higher energy to be deposited
in a tungsten wire in the resistive heating phase.

Thus, we can assume that gas desorption from the wire
surface during explosion may be substantially reduced by
preheating a wire array. As a consequence, the heating time
during explosion is increased, resulting in a higher energy
deposited in the wire core. This may have a profound effect
on the x-ray radiation spectrum and intensity in wire array
implosion. To verify this assumption, we have performed
proof-of-principle experiments on preheated and cold wire
array implosion using the GIT-12 generator. The load was an
array of 12 tungsten wires of 11 µm in diameter arranged in a
circle of 21 mm in diameter. The wire array length and mass
were 15 mm and 220 µg/cm correspondingly. The wires were
subjected to preheating for one hour until the current generator
was triggered. The resistance of a preheated wire array was
4.5 Ohm, which corresponded to a temperature of 1.88 kK.

The following diagnostics were used in the experiments: x-
ray vacuum diode (XRD1) with an aluminum photocathode ﬁl-
tered by a 4 µm Kimfoil plus 0.4 µm aluminum ﬁlter, another
x-ray vacuum diode (XRD2) with an aluminum photocathode
behind a 3 µm Mylar ﬁlter, and a streak camera with a writing
speed of 125 ns/cm. The slit of the camera was normal to the
wire array axis.

Figure 8 shows oscillograms of the generator current and
XRD1 and XRD2 output signals. For an initially cold elec-
trically exploded wire array, no response from XRD1 was
detected. This fact suggests that radiation from a cold wire
array lies in an energy range below 200 eV. In preheated wire
array experiments, the radiation spectrum was found to shift
to a shorter wavelength region as evidenced by an appreciable
signal from XRD1 (see Fig. 8a).

It is obvious from the streak images shown in Fig. 9 that in
the preheated wire array experiments, the wire array implosion
dynamics is changed. As indicated earlier, in cold wire array
experiments, the breakdown along a wire array occurs prior
to melting of the wires. Further heating of unmelted wires is
realized predominantly by heat conduction. Since this is a slow
process, plasma formation is delayed and a radially expanded
structure is produced that retards the implosion process. As
it is shown in [17], preheating of small-diameter wires has a
pronounced effect on the fraction of the wire material passing
into the plasma state and on the axial uniformity of the
resulting plasma. This is sure to affect wire array implosion.

III. SUMMARY

We have studied experimentally time variations of energy
deposition and resistance of tungsten wires with 30.5 µm
diameter for positive or negative polarity of the high-voltage
electrode and varying initial wire temperature. Preheating is
shown to increase the energy deposited in a wire during the
resistive heating stage. The increase in energy deposition is
due to an increase in the time interval between the onset of
current ﬂow and the electrode gap breakdown.

The energy deposited in a wire is found to depend on the
polarity of the high-voltage electrode: for positive polarity the
energy is ∼ 1.7 times higher than for negative polarity.

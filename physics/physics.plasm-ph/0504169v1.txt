Abstract

In this paper the dynamics of Pierce diode with overcritical current

under the inﬂuence of delay feedback is investigated. The system

without feedback demonstrates complex behaviour including chaotic

regimes. The possibility of oscillation regime control depending on the

delay feedback parameter values is shown. Also the paper describes

construction of a ﬁnite-dimensional model of electron beam behaviour,

which is based on the Galerkin approximation by linear modes expan-

sion. The dynamics of the model is close to the one given by the

distributed model.

1 Introduction

Pierce diode is one of the classical models of plasma microwave electronics

[1–9]. This distributed model though is rather simple, demonstrates many

features of the electron beam dynamics in diﬀerent real electron devices.

The model consists of two inﬁnite parallel plains pierced by monoenergetic

electron beam. The region between two plains is evenly ﬁlled by neutralizing

stationary ions, which density is equal to the non-perturbed beam electron

density. The only controlling parameter is named Pierce parameter

α = ωpL/v0,

1

where ωp is the electron beam plasma frequency, L is the distance between
diode plains, v0 is the non-perturbed electron velocity. It was already shown
that with α > π so-named Pierce instability develops in the system and the

virtual cathode is formed in the electron beam [2, 3]. At the same time in a

narrow range of Pierce parameter near 3π the increase of the instability is

suppressed by the non-linearity and in the electron beam the regime with-

out reﬂection realizes.

In this case the system may be described by ﬂuid

equations. It was also shown that in a narrow range of Pierce parameter the

system may represent chaotic dynamics [4–9].

Recently the possibilities of oscillation control in ﬁnite-dimensional dy-

namical systems are explored in detail [10–14]. At the same time the problem

of distributed systems regime control causes great interest. For example it

may be realized by adding to a system a controlled delay feedback [15, 20].

The inﬂuence of the delay feedback on the dynamics of the beam with over-

critical current in the regime of virtual cathode oscillation have been already

investigated and the inﬂuence of the feedback on the characteristics of gen-

eration have been shown [16]. The problem of chaos control in Pierce diode

has also attracted the attention. In particular, the early work [17, 18] con-

sider the possibility of stabilizating chaotic dynamics in Pierce diode in the

regime without electrons’ reﬂection and in the regime with virtual cathode

with the help of E. Ott, C. Grebogy, J. Yorke [10] method. In our work [19]

we analyse the possibility of stabilizating of chaotic dynamics of the ﬂuid

model of Pierce diode using the continuous delay feedback [11].

But the practical realization of such schemes in microwave devices come

across several diﬃculties. So the investigation of chaotic dynamics of dis-

tributed active media with external delay feedback causes great interest.

So it seems interesting to examine the delay feedback inﬂuence on the

dynamics of the system without virtual cathode – the ﬂuid model of Pierce

diode – because it represents all the classical regimes of a real distributed

self-oscillation model. In this work the inﬂuence of the feedback parameters

to the system characteristics is examined. The distributed chaotic system is

analysed with the help of the numerical modelling of the original system of in

2

partial derivative non-linear equations and with the use of ﬁnite-dimensional

model.

The structure of the work is the follows. In section 2 we discuss the ﬂuid

model of the Pierce diode without feedback. In section 3 explored in detail

the dynamics of this model with the added delay feedback depending on the

value of delay time and feedback amplitude. The ﬁnite dimensional model

of the investigated system using the Galerkin method is constructed and its

behavior under the inﬂuence of the delay feedback is investigated in section

4. The dynamics of ﬁnite-dimensional model is compared with the behaviour

of the electron beam in the distributed system.

The dynamics of Pierce diode processes in ﬂuid electronics approximation is

described by movement, continuity and Poisson equations:

∂x2 = α2(ρ − 1),
where ϕ is the space charge ﬁeld potential, ρ is the electron density, v is the

(3)

electron beam velocity.

The boundary conditions are:

v(0, t) = v0,

ρ(0, t) = ρ0, ϕ(0, t) = ϕ(1, t) = 0.

(4)

The initial conditions are taken as a small perturbation of the space charge

density near the homogeneous equilibrium state

v(x) = v0,

ρ(x) = ρ0,

ϕ(x) = ϕ0

as ρ(x, 0) = ˜ρ sin 2πx where ˜ρ ≪ 1. The equilibrium state becomes unstable

then α > π. In the equations the normalized values are used.

3

The delay feedback is brought in by modelling the potential diﬀerence

between entrance and exit grids by the signal taken oﬀ from the interac-

tion space in the point x = xdf . As a control signal the oscillations of the
space charge density ρ(xdf , t) is used. It can be interpreted as connecting a
waveguide with a delay line to the interaction space, which is excited by the

electron beam oscillations. Adding the delay feedback into the model leads

to the changes in the right boundary conditions

ϕ(1, t) = fdf (t) = A(ρ(xdf , t − d) − ρ0).

Here A is the delay feedback coeﬃcient, characterizing the part of the oscil-

lation power branched to the feedback delay line, d is the delay time value.

Assuming that the development of the processes in our system begins at t = 0

and when t < 0 the space charge density is non-perturbed ρ(x, t) = ρ0, the
initial distribution of the delay feedback function is written as

fdf (t)|t∈[−d,0] = 0.

We have found out that the point of connection xdf does not inﬂuence
upon the dynamics of the system. In this work value xdf is ﬁxed as xdf = 0.2.
Numerical solution of the equations (1) and (2) is found using explicit

scheme with diﬀerences against ﬂow. Poisson equation (3) is integrated using

error vector propagation (EVP) method [21].

3 Delay feedback inﬂuence on the nonlinear

dynamics of electron beam

In Pierce diode without delay feedback when α decreases from 2.88π to 2.86π

the behaviour of the electron beam changes from regular via period doubling

cascade to weakly chaotic with neatly expressed time scale. With the further

decrease of Pierce parameter the chaotic oscillations of the beam complicate

essentially, the time scale disappears and spectral distribution complicates.

We call this two types of chaotic behaviour ribbon and spiral chaos. All

4

the results described in this paper have been derived for α = 2.86π, i.e. a

system without delay feedback must represent the ”spiral chaos” oscillations.

As quantitative characteristics of oscillation regime correlation dimension

D [22] and highest Lyapunov index λ [23] for the restored attractor are

taken. This values do not change in the diﬀerent points of interaction space

D = 2.18 ÷ 0.01, λ = 0.16 ÷ 0.04.

In ﬁgure 1 the diﬀerent regimes are

represented on the A–d parameter plane with α = 2.86π.

Figure 1: Oscillation regimes reproduced on parameter plane (A, d) (α =

2.86π, xdf = 0.2)

For comparison the non-dimensional characteristic time of oscillations in

the electron beam τ = 4.06. The areas of n-periodical oscillations on the

parameter plane are marked as Tn When A ≪ 1 the system demonstrates
chaotic oscillations identical to those without feedback.

In ﬁgure 2 the phase-plane portraits, spectrums and time series for the

”spiral” chaos regime (a), weakly developed chaos (b) and regular (period 1)

oscillations (c) are represented. The phase-plane portraits are reconstructed

by Takens delay method [24] from the time series characterizing the oscilla-

tion of the space charge density in the ﬁxed point of the distributed system.

5

Figure 2: Phase portraits, spectrums and time series of electron beam oscil-

lations for the cases of “spiral” chaos regime (a), weakly developed chaos (b)

and regular (period 1) (c) regimes

Though system behaviour (a) is rather complex, in the frequency spectrum

one can see the base frequency f0 = 1/τ = 0.25 and its second harmony
2f0. Analyzing the system attractor in phase-plane space one can see that
near the instable state ρ = ρ0 there is a loop on which the motion of the
phase point become slower. The other space of attractor is tightly ﬁlled by

spiral phase pathes. When A increases the behaviour of the system may be

diﬀerent depending on the value of delay time d. If d > τ /2 the complexity

of electron beam dynamics increases with the increasing of A. The frequency

spectrum and the phase-plane portrait become more complex too, the os-

cillation amplitude enlarges. Further enlargement of A leads to essentially

diﬀerent dynamics of the system. The oscillation amplitude sharply increases

and then in the electron beam the reﬂected electrons appear. In the system

appears the virtual cathode. The electron beam behaviour is determined by

two mechanisms - the Pierce instability and its limitation by the nonlinearity.

6

The delay feedback with parameter values d > 1.8 ÷ 2 A > 0.02 destroys the

limitation mechanism and leads to the increasing of instability and further

to virtual cathode forming. In this case the ﬂuid model becomes incorrect

because equations (1), (2) describes the processes in the electron beam only

without overtaking or reﬂection. The threshold value AV C depends on the
value of d. In the case d < τ /2 the complexity of the electron beam oscillation

decreases with the increase of A. The noise base diminishes, with the further

enlargement of A on the bifurcation map one can see periodic gaps. When

A > 0.03 a transition from the chaotic to periodical dynamics via reverse

doubling period cascade have place. The oscillation amplitude decreases and

approach to non-perturbed value ρ0. In a wide range of feedback parameters
it is possible to suppress the chaotic dynamics of the electron beam and to

establish the regular one. In ﬁgure 1 the areas of cycles 1-16 period and tran-

sitions between diﬀerent regimes depending on the changes of delay feedback

parameters are shown.

Now some words about the physical processes in the electron beam. As

the explorations of the electron waves propagation show, dynamics of electron

beam is mainly determined by the distance between the current state of

the system and the homogeneous equilibrium state ρ(x) = ρ0, v(x) = v0,
ϕ(x) = ϕ0. The distance between the current state of the system and the
homogeneous equilibrium state can be determined as

oscillations (c).

S(t) = 

.

(5)

Time-dependent changes of this value illustrates ﬁgure 3 for the cases of

spiral chaos regime (a), weakly developed chaos (b) and regular (period 1)

In the ﬁrst case the system in some time comes very close to the homo-

geneous equilibrium state S ∼ 0 and the oscillation amplitude is very small.

Then the mechanism of instability activates and the amplitude of the os-

cillations increases until it’s limited by the nonlinearity. Then the process

repeats, but each time S and the space distributions of the values near the

homogeneous equilibrium state depending on time for the cases of ”spiral”

chaos regime (a), weakly developed chaos (b) and regular (period 1) (c)

regimes

equilibrium state are diﬀerent, so the development of instability begins from

another conditions and the dynamics of the system is irregular. The dynam-

ics of the system can also be examined by considering non-linear energetic

functionals [25]:

This functions describe energy transitions between kinetic energy of the

beam movement and potential energy of the space charge ﬁeld. One can see

that for the chaotic regimes the maximums of the functionals are larger than

those for the regular processes, because of the larger degree of non-linearity

in the chaotic regime.

Figure 4: Diﬀerence between kinetic energy and potential energy of the beam

movement ∆W = Wk − Wp for the cases of ”spiral” chaos regime (solid line)
and regular regime (dotted line)

Figure 4 illustrates the time-dependence of the function ∆W = Wk − Wp
characterizing the energy transition processes in the electron beam. In the

periodic regime (the dotted line) the energy transitions are regular. The

maximums of the functions shows the accumulation of the charge in the

interaction space. In the chaotic regime (the solid line) in some moments the

energy diﬀerence ∆W = 0. The system nears to the unstable equilibrium

state. Then the wave movement energy increases again abruptly. Further

the perturbation energy decreases and the system protractedly is situated

near the equilibrium state. It can be physically explained as follows: in the

electron beam the stationary wave of electron density appears. Its amplitude

9

increases abruptly near the exit grid. Then the electromagnetic ﬁeld of this

clot brakes the following electrons and the result is that much more electrons

leave the interaction gap then enter it. The discussed values approach the

equilibrium state and then the process repeats from the new starting point.

The feedback destroys this mechanism. When the delay time d < τ /2 the

system cannot approach the equilibrium state because the feedback signal

extenuates the stored charge in the exit region and promotes the acceleration

of the beam in the instant time when ∆W is maximal. And vice versa when

d < τ /2 the feedback signal leads to the increasing of oscillation amplitude,

the system dynamics become more complicate and with suﬃciently large A

the virtual cathode appears.

4 Finite-dimensional model of electron beam

dynamics

In [2] the method of constructing a ﬁnite-dimensional model based on the

Galerkin approximation by linear modes expansion is described. It has been

shown by [26] that in the range of Pierce parameter variation α ∈ (2π, 3π) in

the system excites inﬁnite number of modes which can be determined from

the dispersion equation

exp[jα̟]

(cid:8)

(̟2 + 1) sin α + 2j̟ cos α
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

−α̟2 − 2j̟

(̟2 − 1)−2 = 0,

+ α̟4−

(7)

(cid:9)

where ̟ = ω/ωp. In the case of Pierce diode system the modes were deter-
mined by Kuhn (1986). It have been shown that among the excited modes

only three were damping rather slowly and containing the most part of the

system energy. So for the description of the system dynamics it is enough to

take into account only this three modes. For the diﬀerent Pierce parameter

values corresponding to diﬀerent dynamical regimes the space distributions

vary weakly, so we can suppose they are independent of α. The initial basis

10

for the ﬁnite-dimensional approximation is taken as

where Ri, Vi, Φi are the space distributions modes for the λi, αi are the modes

for weakly perturbed values, we derive the nullity vector ~Ψ = (Ψ1, Ψ2, Ψ3),

tions (9)–(11), we derive the matrix equation for the coeﬃcients ai:

where vector A is composed from coeﬃcients ai. The elements of matrixes

(17)

The coeﬃcients lij are derived from numerical solution of the implicit equa-
tions and are independent of Pierce parameter variations. The non-linearities

of the system are quadratic and appears because of the kinematic non-

linearities and those presenting in continuity equation. The 1 and 2 modes

are excited by the instability negative dissipation and its energy is inherited

into the 3rd mode. As the numerical analysis shows the ﬁnite-dimensional

demonstrates the same types of behaviour as the distributed one. With the

decrease of α the system dynamics becomes more complex and further tran-

sition to chaos via period doubling cascade takes place. The comparison

of bifurcation diagrams for the distributed model and the ﬁnite-dimensional

model is made in ﬁgure 5.

Also in the system two variants of the chaotic regime similar to those

in the distributed model are observed – the ”spiral” chaos and the ”band”

chaos. The delay feedback is brought in by adding into the right part of the

equations (7)-(9) the signal Fdf (t − d) which is formed as:

Fdf (t) = A[a1(t) + a2(t) + a3(t)]

(18)

In ﬁgure 6 the bifurcation map in the parameters A – d for the ﬁnite-

dimensional model is presented. The Pierce parameter α = 2.774π. With

this parameter value in the system without feedback the ”spiral” chaotic

oscillations are observed. In the map we can see that with the increase of

feedback signal amplitude and d < τ /2 (where τ ≈ 3.15 = 1/f0, f0 - the base
spectrum frequency) the chaotic dynamics is suppressed and regular regime

is installed.

When d > τ /2 the oscillation amplitude sharply increases which is equal

to system transition to virtual cathode forming regime, where the ﬁnite-

dimensional equations become incorrect. Comparing ﬁgure 1 and ﬁgure 4

13

dimensional model (b)

feedback, α = 2.86π

one can see that the ﬁnite-dimensional model gives a very good description

of the processes taking place in the distributed system.

5 Conclusion

In our work the delay feedback inﬂuence on the electron beam dynamics in

hydrodynamical and ﬁnite-dimensional models of Pierce diode is investigated.

It is shown that with some feedback parameters’ values the chaotic dynamics

of the electron beam is suppressed and periodical regimes of diﬀerent types

may be installed. Physically it is connected with the changing of conditions

of electron waves propagation. The practical interest for this phenomenon is

caused by the ability of eliminating the undesirable parasitical and chaotical

oscillations in some real systems where Pierce instability may appear (for

example, in electron guns, beams of charged particles, etc.).

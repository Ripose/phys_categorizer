The dispersion relation of longitudinal electrostatic oscillations in a relativistic plasma is studied in
the context of the nonextensive statistics formalism proposed by Tsallis [C. Tsallis, J. Stat. Phys. 52,
479 (1988)], where nonextensivity is characterized by a parameter q in Tsallis’s entropy. q = 1
corresponds to the usual Boltzmann-Gibbs, extensive statistics formalism.
In the nonrelativistic
regime, normalizability of the equilibrium distribution function implies that −1 ≤ q ≤ ∞. We
show that in the relativistic regime much tighter constraints must be satisﬁed, namely 0 ≤ q ≤
2
1 + kBT /mc
, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the plasma, and m is
the particle mass.

Then we study longitudinal oscillations in a proton-electron plasma, assuming immobile protons,
and electrons whose distribution function maximizes Tsallis’s entropy. The dispersion relation of
these oscillations is written in integral form for the long wavelength limit. Explicit expressions
in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions can be found for all possibles values of q in the
ultra-relativistic regime.

Traditionally, the equilibrium of statistical systems has been studied based on the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy,

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and pi is the probability of the i-th microstate. However, an increasing amount
of experimental, computational and theoretical evidence, shows that this formalism is not adequate for systems where
long range interactions in time or space are important, and, in general, systems where the relevant phase space has
fractal or multifractal structure. Tsallis [1] proposed the following form for the entropy of such systems:

where q is a real number. For q = 1, Sq reduces to SBG.

Sq has the basic property that for independent systems A and B, the entropy of the composite system A + B is

given by:

Sq(A + B) = Sq(A) + Sq(B) + (1

q)Sq(A)Sq(B) .

−

Thus, q is a measure of the nonextensivity. Among the various physical systems where connections with the Tsallis
entropy formalism have been found are gravitational systems [2], long range Hamiltonian systems [3], nonlinear
inverse bremsstrahlung absorption in plasmas [4], turbulence [5], and granular systems [6], and many applications in
astrophysics, ﬂuid dynamics, biology, economy, quantum mechanics, and others. (See, e.g. [7].)

An important property of the nonextensive formalism is that the distribution function which maximizes Sq is non-
Maxwellian [8, 9]. Speciﬁcally, for q < 1, high energy states are more probable than in the extensive case; for q > 1
high energy states are less probable than in the extensive case, and there is a cutoﬀ beyond which no states exist. For
a unidimensional gas where E = mv2/2, this cutoﬀ is given by [9]

vmax =

2kBT /m(q

1) .

p

Velocity distributions in plasmas are often found to be non-Maxwellian. High energy tails in space and laboratory
plasmas [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] are a common occurrence. Metaequilibrium non-Maxwellian radial density proﬁles in
cylindrical turbulent pure electron plasmas are observed [15]. As stated above, such distribution functions emerge
naturally if the system is described by a nonextensive statistics, and several authors have successfully applied this
approach to plasma systems [4, 16, 17, 18].

Lima et al. [9] studied the longitudinal oscillations of a collisionless thermal plasma, in the context of the nonexten-
sive formalism based on (2). They derived the dispersion relation for electrostatic waves, and calculated it explicitly

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

for an equilibrium distribution function which maximizes (2). They found that it ﬁts experimental data better than
if the energy distribution is given by a Maxwellian.

All the previous analysis have been made for non-relativistic plasmas. However, relativistic extensions of the Tsallis
formalism are possible [19]. Our purpose is to study the consequences of a relativistic nonextensive statistics in
plasmas. In particular, we will examine some general properties of the equilibrium distribution function and calculate
the dispersion relation for electrostatic waves in the long wavelength limit for ultrarelativistic plasmas.

II. RELATIVISTIC DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION

In the nonextensive description, the equilibrium distribution function for a relativistic plasma can be written [19]

where

Equation (5) generalizes the nonrelativistic expression (see, e.g., [9]). For q = 1, (5) yields the usual Boltzmann

distribution function fq=1 = A1 exp(

E/kBT ).

−

For simplicity, in the following we will consider a one dimensional plasma, so that ~p = pˆz.
Since the relativistic energy is positive, fq will be real and normalizable if E satisﬁes the following conditions:

i.e., E can take any possible value if q

both (7) and (8) hold for the extensive limit q = 1, in which case they give the expected constraint 0

1, but the distribution function has an energy cutoﬀ if q

Due to the cutoﬀ (7), if q

III. DISPERSION RELATION FOR LONGITUDINAL PLASMA OSCILLATIONS

We consider a proton-electron relativistic plasma. Assuming protons remain at rest, and that particles only move

in one dimension (ˆz), the dispersion relation for longitudinal oscillations is

1 = i

dpz

where ωp is the plasma frequency, k is the wavenumber, s is the argument of the Laplace transform (s =
iω, where ω
is the wave frequency, if there is no damping), m the electron mass, p = mγv is the particle momentum, and fq(p, z)
is the equilibrium electron distribution function, normalized to unity. Particle energy is E =

m2c4 + p2

−

zc2.

Following Ref. [9], we now consider the long wavelength limit k

length. The integrand has a pole at v =

is/k. If Im v

Equation (15) depends on q in general, and therefore, unlike the nonrelativistic case [9], nonextensive corrections

to the dispersion relation of longitudinal waves may appear to the lowest order in kvz/s.

IV. ULTRARELATIVISTIC PLASMA

Closed expressions in terms of known functions can be obtained for Eq. (15) in the ultrarelativistic case

As shown in Sec. II, q can only take values between 0 and 1 + kBT /mc2. We consider two situations:

V. CONCLUSIONS

6

Some consequences of describing a plasma based on a nonextensive statistical treatment have been discussed. In
particular, the one dimensional plasma distribution function which maximizes Tsallis’s entropy Sq has been considered.
In the nonrelativistic case, normalizability of the distribution function constrains q to values greater than or equal
to
1. However, in the relativistic case a much shorter range is possible, and the maximum value of q depends on the
ratio of temperature to particle rest energy.

−

Then we derive the dispersion relation for longitudinal oscillations in a plasma composed of electrons and rest
protons. In the long wavelength limit, and unlike the nonrelativistic case, nonextensive corrections appear to the
lowest order. Finally, in the ultra-relativistic regime, this dispersion relation is written explicitly in terms of generalized
hypergeometric functions.

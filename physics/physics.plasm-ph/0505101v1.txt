Abstract

The aim of the present work is to investigate tokamak equilibria with reversed magnetic
shear and sheared ﬂow, which may play a role in the formation of internal transport
barriers (ITBs), within the framework of two-ﬂuid model. The study is based on ex-
act self-consistent solutions in cylindrical geometry by means of which the impact of the
magnetic shear, s, and the “toroidal” (axial) and “poloidal” (azimuthal) ion velocity com-
ponents, viz and viθ, on the radial electric ﬁeld, Er, its shear, |dEr/dr|, and the shear of
the E × B velocity, ωE×B ≡ |d/dr(E × B/B2)|, is examined. For a wide parametric
regime of experimental concern it turns out that the contributions of the viz, viθ and
pressure gradient (∇Pi) terms to Er, |E′
r| and ωE×B are of the same order of magnitude.
The contribution of the ∇Pi term is missing in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) [G. Poulipoulis et al. Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 46 (2004) 639]. The impact
of s on ωE×B through the ∇Pi term is stronger than that through the velocity terms; in
particular for Bz = constant, the contributions of the ∇Pi and velocity terms to ωE×B
at the point where dEr/dr = 0 are proportional to (1 − s)(2 − s) and (1 − s), respec-
tively. The results indicate that, alike MHD, the magnetic shear and the sheared toroidal
and poloidal velocities act synergetically in producing electric ﬁelds and therefore ωE×B
proﬁles compatible with ones observed in discharges with ITBs; owing to the ∇Pi term,
however, the impact of s on Er, |E′

r| and ωE×B is stronger than that in MHD.

Introduction

Tokamak discharges with improved energy and particle conﬁnement properties in con-
nection with internal transport barriers (ITBs) have certain attractive features, such as a
large bootstrap current fraction, which suggest a potential route to steady-state mode of
operation desirable for fusion power plants. Long quasi-steady or steady ITB states have
been obtained in diﬀerent tokamaks, e.g ASDEX Upgrate [1, 2], JT-60U [3], Tore-Supra
[4], and JET [5] where ITBs were maintained for up to 11 s. The ITBs usually are associ-
ated with reversed magnetic shear proﬁles [6],[7] and their main characteristics are steep
pressure proﬁles in the barrier region [8] and radial electric ﬁelds associated with sheared
ﬂows [9, 10]. The mechanism responsible for the formation of ITBs and the underlying
physics is not completely understood. Most theoretical models supported by experimental
observations rely on suppression of microinstability induced transport in connection with
reversed magnetic shear, s < 0, sheared ﬂow, the radial electric ﬁeld, Er, its shear, |E′
r|,
and most importantly the E × B velocity shear,

In particular the E × B velocity shear may lead to a reduction in the amplitude of
turbulent ﬂuctuations, even to their suppression, or to a decrease in the radial correlation
lengths [11]. Although there are experimental observations supporting this scenario, the
overall experimental evidence up to date is rather complicated, not universal in the various
tokamak machines and has not made clear whether the magnetic shear or the sheared ﬂow
(toroidal or poloidal) are more important for the ITB formation. A discussion on this
issue is made in the Introduction of Ref.
[12]. Also, the experimental and theoretical
knowledge on discharges with ITBs was reviewed recently in Refs. [11] and [13].

In a previous work [12] we studied magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium states
In particular,
with reversed magnetic shear and sheared ﬂow in cylindrical geometry.
presuming that Er, E′
r and ωE×B are of relevance to the formation of ITBs we examined
how these quantities are aﬀected by the magnetic shear and sheared ﬂow and found that
the latter quantities act synergetically in increasing ωE×B with the impact of the ﬂow, in
particular the poloidal one, being stronger than that of the magnetic shear, s. The present
work aims at extending the study to the framework of the two ﬂuid model. This model is
advantageous over MHD in that the contribution of the ion pressure gradient (∇Pi) term
to Er, contribution which is missing in MHD, can be obtained from the ion (or electron)
momentum equation. In addition the current density can be expressed self-consistently in
terms of the ion and electron ﬂuid velocities. Also, we shall examine the impact of certain
local characteristics of the safety factor proﬁle, i.e. the minimum of q and its position,
on the aforementioned quantities (not addressed in Ref. [12]) and the relative sign of the
“toroidal” (axial) ion velocity, viz, “poloidal” (azimuthal) ion velocity, viθ, and toroidal
magnetic ﬁeld, Bz. It turns out that, owing to the ∇Pi term, the impact of s on Er, E′
r and
ωE×B is stronger than that in MHD. The contribution of both ﬂow components, however,
In addition in many cases s enhances the velocity contribution to
remains signiﬁcant.
these quantities which, alike in MHD, indicates a synergism of s and the ﬂow.

The work will be conducted through the following steps. Exact solutions of a slightly
reduced set of two-ﬂuid equilibrium equations for a cylindrical magnetically conﬁned
plasma are constructed in section 2 by prescribing the proﬁles of certain free quanti-

2

ties, including the safety factor and the toroidal and poloidal ion velocities, in accord
with ITB experimental ones. Then in section 3 we examine the impact of s, the velocity,
the velocity shear, the local characteristics of q, and the relative signs of the velocity
components and Bz on Er, E′
r and ωE×B. The characteristics of the pressure and toroidal
current density are also brieﬂy discussed. The conclusions are summarized in section 4.

2. Two-ﬂuid cylindrical equilibria with reversed magnetic shear

The two-ﬂuid equilibrium states of an ideal quasineutral plasma are governed by the
following set of equations written in Gaussian units with both 4π and the velocity of light
being set to unity:

∇ · (nvα) = 0,
mαnα(vα · ∇)vα = −∇Pα + qαnα(E + vα × B),
vα · ∇Tα = 0,
Zini ≈ ne = n,
∇ × E = 0,
∇ · B = 0,

∇ × B =

nαqαvα = J,

Xα

where the index α denotes the particle species (α = i for ions and e for electrons); n
is the plasma density in connection with the quasi-neutrality condition (5); qα is the
charge of each particle species with Zi being the atomic number. The rest of the notation
is standard. The energy equation (4), associated with the fact that for fusion plasmas
the heat conduction along B is large and therefore the temperature becomes uniform on
magnetic surfaces on a fast time scale, is particularly appropriate for electrons. For ions
one alternatively can use an adiabatic energy equation:

vi · ∇Pi + γPi∇ · vi = 0.

Compared with the respective set of MHD equations (see for example Eqs. (2)-(6) of Ref.
[12]) Eqs. (2-8) are advantageous in two respects: (i) the momentum equation includes the
electric ﬁeld and therefore the pressure gradient contribution to E can be calculated from
this equation; this contribution is missing in the frame of MHD because E is calculated
by Ohm’s law, E + v × B = 0, and (ii) the current density J is related self-consistently
to the ﬂuid species velocities [Eq. (8)].

The system under consideration is a cylindrical plasma of circular cross-section con-
ﬁned by a magnetic ﬁeld having toroidal and poloidal components Bz and Bθ respectively.
Also the velocity has toroidal and poloidal components and the electric ﬁeld is radial. Be-
cause of symmetry any equilibrium quantity depends solely on the radial distance r;
therefore Eqs. (2), (4)[and (9)], (6), and (7) are identically satisﬁed. Also the ﬂow for
both ﬂuid species is incompressible (∇ · vα = 0). Under these considerations 6 out of the
12 scalar quantities remain free and can be prescribed.

Adding Eq. (9) for ions and electrons yields the MHD momentum equation

is the poloidal Mach number. Because of symmetry the toroidal velocity as well as the
velocity shear (of both toroidal and poloidal components) do not appear in (10). It is
convenient to use (10) instead of (3) for the electrons. Therefore the slightly reduced
set of equilibrium equations we will use in the following consists of Eqs. (2), (3), (4) for
ions only, (5), (6), (7), (8), and (10). By expressing Bθ in terms of the safety factor, q =
rBθ/(R0Bz), with 2πR0 associated with the length of the plasma column, and introducing
the normalized radius ρ = r/r0 with r0 corresponding to the plasma surface, Eq. (10) can
be put in the form

where qc = q(r = 0), rmin is the position of qmin, and ∆q = qc − qmin. The shape of the
q proﬁle is determined by adjusting the parameters qmin, ∆q and rmin. Note that |s| is
proportional to ∆q; therefore as ∆q takes larger values the magnetic shear increases in
both the s < 0 and s > 0 regions. A q proﬁle compatible with experimental ones (see for
example ﬁgure 10 in Ref. [14]) is presented in ﬁgure 1.
Toroidal magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle:

Bz = Bz0[1 + δ(1 − ρ2)]1/2,

where Bz0 is the vacuum magnetic ﬁeld and the parameter δ is related to the magnetic
properties of the plasma, i.e. for δ < 0 the plasma is diamagnetic.

Since in tokamaks Mθ < 0.1, the ﬂow term in (11) is perturbative around the “static”
equilibrium Mθ = 0 and therefore it can be neglected.
It should be noted, however,
that this approximation may be not good for non-circular cylindrical or axisymmetric
plasmas because in these cases the convective term in the momentum equation depends
on the velocity shear which in certain regions may become large (see for example the
z-independent cylindrical and axisymmetric incompressible MHD equilibrium equations
[15] and [16] respectively). The following quantities then can be

be determined by the relation J = ne(vi − ve). It is noted here that the ∇Pi term in
(18) can be obtained in the framework of the ideal Hall-MHD model, alternatively to the
complete two ﬂuid one, which includes the generalized Ohm’s law:

E + v × B =

(J × B − ∇Pe) .

(19)

Neglecting in the Hall-MHD momentum equation the convective ﬂow term (which for the
case under consideration corresponds to Mθ = 0), the term j × B in (19) can be expressed
in terms of the total pressure gradient:

j × B = ∇P = ∇(Pi + Pe);

then Eq. (19) leads to (18). The above prescriptions and subsequent suggested calcula-
tions consists a procedure to solve analytically the set of the two-ﬂuid equations. The
calculations have been performed analytically by developing a programm for symbolic
computation [17] in connection with [18].

Inspection of (18) implies that in addition to the dependence of Er and E′

r on the
magnetic shear through the dPi/dρ term, s is involved in the viz term through the q de-
pendence of Bθ. The quantity ωE×B is stronger aﬀected by the magnetic shear because
s is involved in both the viz and viθ terms of ωE×B [see Eqs. (20) and (21) in section
3]. These observations indicate that there is a synergetic contribution of magnetic shear
and ﬂow to Er, E′
r, and ωE×B. In this report results not obtainable within the framework
of MHD will mainly be presented in next section. MHD results were reported in Ref. [12].

3. Results

We have set the following values for some of the parameters: Bz0 = 1T , δ = −0.0975,
Zi = 1, r0 = 1m, R0 = 3m, n0 = 5 × 1019part./m3, λ = 0.6. The choice qmin ≥ 2
was made because according to experimental evidence for qmin < 2 strong MHD activity
destroys conﬁnement possibly due to a double tearing mode [19]. A similar result was
found numerically for one-dimensional cylindrical equilibria with hollow currents in [20].
Moreover in discharges with reversed magnetic shear in JET a correlation was found
between the formation of ITBs and qmin reaching an integer value (2 or 3) [21]. The impact
of the magnetic shear and ﬂow proﬁles on the equilibrium characteristics was examined by
varying the parameters ∆q, qmin, rmin, h, viz0 and viθ0 in the ranges (4-14), (2-3), (0.5-0.6),
(0.001-0.1), (105-106 ms−1) and (104-105 ms−1) respectively; consequently qc = qmin + ∆q
varies from 6 to 16 and it is guaranteed that M 2

a scaling typical in tokamaks because Bz ≈ 10Bθ and viz ≈ 10viθ [22, 23]. The impact
of the variation of magnetic shear through ∆q was studied by keeping rmin and qmin
constant, while the impact of rmin and qmin was examined with constant ∆q.

First we will brieﬂy report certain characteristics of the pressure and toroidal current
density proﬁles which remain similar as in MHD. The total pressure proﬁle, and therefore
the Pi one, is peaked and for s < 0 becomes steeper when |s| increases as can be deduced
from Eq. (11) (see also ﬁgure 2). In addition (11) implies that the proﬁle becomes steeper
as the plasma becomes more diamagnetic, i.e. when B′
z in connection with δ in (13) takes
larger values. The Jz-proﬁle is hollow with its maximum located in the region where the
qmin lies as can be seen in ﬁgure 3. These characteristics are observed in discharges with
ITBs [11] and are favorable for ITB formation. Especially for s > 2 a reversal of Jz occurs
in the s > 0 region. This characteristic is discussed further in Ref. [12]. It is also noted
that a suﬃcient stability criterion for equilibria with reversed current density in the outer
plasma area and monotonically increasing q-proﬁles was derived in Ref. [24].
The conclusions on the impact of the magnetic shear and ﬂow on Er, |E′

r| and ωE×B

are reported on an individual basis in the rest of this section.

3.1 Electric ﬁeld (Er)

1. The electric ﬁeld consists of the ∇Pi, viz and, viθ contributions in connection with
the ﬁrst, second, and third term in Eq.
(18). Each of these terms contributes
of about the same order of magnitude to Er (ﬁgure 4). This is consistent with
experimental evidence [11]. A similar result was obtained in a diﬀerent way in [25]
(see ﬁgure 4 therein). It is apparent from (18) that Er depends linearly on viz and
viθ with the overall velocity contribution to Er, however, depending on the relative
signs of viz, viθ and Bz.

2. Typical Er proﬁles exhibit an extremum located in the neighborhood of the qmin

position (ﬁgure 4).

3. Increase of |s|, by increasing ∆q, makes the maximum of |Er| to take larger values
(ﬁgure 5). Pending on the direction (toroidal or poloidal) of the velocity and the
shape of its proﬁle, variation of ∆q from 4 to 14 increases the values of the |Er|
maximum in a range that varies from 5.6% for purely poloidal ﬂow to 48% for

6

purely peaked toroidal ﬂow. It is reminded that, in addition to the s dependence of
the ∇Pi term in (18), s contributes to Er synergetically with the viz term (the viθ
term is s independent).

4. The larger rmin the higher the values of the |Er| maximum (for given values of ∆q
and qmin) as shown in ﬁgure 6. Quantitatively for a variation of rmin from 0.5 to
0.6, the increase of |Er| maximum varies from 36% to 70%. Also the position of the
extremum (located in the vicinity of rmin) is displaced outwards.

5. The larger qmin the smaller the |Er| maximum (ﬁgure 7). In particular, increase of
qmin from 2 to 3 (with ∆q = 4 and rmin = 0.5), results in a decrease of the |Er|
maximum in the range (12%, 40%).

6. When the ﬂow shear increases (by decreasing h from 0.1 to 0.001) the extremum of

Er remains practically unchanged in most of the cases considered.

3.1 Shear of the electric ﬁeld (|E′

r|)

1. As in the case of Er the contributions from the ∇Pi-, viz- and viθ-related terms to

E′

r are of the same order of magnitude as shown in ﬁgure 8.

2. The proﬁle of E′

r exhibits one local extremum on each side of the qmin position

(ﬁgure 9). The two extrema are of opposite sign.

3. Increase of |s| increases both maxima of |E′

r| in most of the ﬂow cases considered and
this increase is larger in the region where s > 0 than that where s < 0. This is shown
in ﬁgure (9). For certain combinations of the velocity components, however, the one
extremum increases and the other decreases. Such a case with peaked toroidal viz
and poloidal viθ ﬂow is shown in ﬁgure 10.

4. The larger rmin the higher the maxima of |E′

r| (ﬁgure 11) unless the case of poloidal
velocity in conjunction with Gaussian-like toroidal one. Pending on the direction
and the shape of the velocity this increase varies from from 8% to 42%. Also the
proﬁle of |E′

r| is displaced outwards as can be seen in ﬁgure 11.

5. An increase of qmin results in a decrease of the |E′

r| extremum in the s > 0 region in
all of the cases considered while in the s < 0 region this happens for viθ = 0 (ﬁgure
12).

6. By increasing the velocity shear the maxima of |E′

r| are also increased in all of the

cases considered (ﬁgure 13).

7. For either purely toroidal or poloidal ﬂow, increase of the maximum absolute value
of the velocity by a factor increases the maxima of |E′
r| by the same factor in all of
the cases considered with the following exception: purely toroidal peaked ﬂow for
which the maximum in the s < 0 region increases and the one in the s > 0 region
decreases.

7

8. For either purely toroidal or purely poloidal ﬂow, inversion of the velocity direction
causes a change in the sign of the two E′
r extrema. Also, this inversion leads to (i)
an increase of both maxima of |E′
r| for Gaussian-like viz, (ii) an increase of the one
|E′
r| maximum in the s > 0 and a decrease of the other in the s < 0 region and
(iii) a decrease of both maxima for purely poloidal ﬂow. For Gaussian-like viz the
increase of the one |E′
r|-maximum in the s > 0 region caused by inversion is greater
than the increase of the other in the s < 0 region.

3.3 Shear of the E × B velocity (ωE×B)

1. The proﬁle of ωE×B (Eq. 1) possesses two maxima located the one in the s < 0
and the other in the s > 0 regions (ﬁgure 14). Larger of the two maxima is the one
which lies in the region of steeper pressure proﬁle.

2. The impact of the magnetic shear on ωE×B is stronger than that in MHD due to the
∇Pi term of the electric ﬁeld [Eq. (18)]. Speciﬁcally for constant Bz and arbitrary
proﬁles of q, viz and viθ, Eq. (1) yields at the point where E′

r = 0

where

The ﬁrst term in (20) stems from the ∇Pi part of Er in (11) while the second term
comes from the viz and viθ parts of Er. The subscript MHD is used to emphasize the
similarity of (21) with the respective MHD relation derived in Ref.
[12] [equation
(18) therein]. It is apparent the ∇Pi-related dependence of ωE×B on s, proportional
to (1−s)(2−s), is stronger than the viz and viθ dependence proportional to 1−s; also,
the absolute values of the ∇Pi-, viz- and viθ- related terms are individually larger
for s < 0 than s > 0. The contribution of each of these terms to ωE×B however is
of the same order of magnitude. Note that despite of the tokamak pertinent scaling
viz ≈ 10viθ, the contributions of viz and viθ terms are of the same order of magnitude
because of the factor ǫρ/q. The “equipartition” of the three terms holds in general
for the whole ωE×B proﬁle obtained via the symbolic computation programme as
shown in Fig 15.

3. Increase of the ﬂow via either |viz0| or |viθ0| by a factor increases the maxima of

ωE×B by the same factor.

The impact of the magnetic shear through ∆q and the ﬂow on ωE×B is similar as that

on E′

r. Speciﬁcally:

1. Increase of |s| leads to larger values for the maxima of ωE×B in most of the ﬂow
cases considered (ﬁgure 16). There are some combinations of velocity components
however for which the one maximum increases and the other decreases. Such a
In which region (s < 0 or s < 0) the increase takes

place depends on the particular velocity components involved and the shape of the
toroidal velocity proﬁle.

2. The larger rmin the greater the ωE×B-maxima (ﬁgure 18) in the same cases as for
r. The proﬁle of ωE×B is also displaced outwards as can be seen in ﬁgure 18.

E′

3. Increase of qmin causes (i) a decrease of the ωE×B-maximum in the s > 0 region in
all of the cases considered and (ii) an increase of ωE×B -maximum in the s < 0 one
for viθ 6= 0 (ﬁgure 19).

4. The larger the ﬂow shear the greater the ωE×B maxima in all of the cases considered

(ﬁgure 20).

5. ωE×B is aﬀected by the relative signs of viθ, viz and Bz as is apparent from Eqs. (20)
and (21). In particular (i) inversion of the Gaussian-like toroidal velocity increases
the maxima of ωE×B (ﬁgure 21), (ii) the maximum of ωE×B in the s > 0 region
increases while the one in the s < 0 region decreases due to the reversal of the
peaked toroidal velocity and (iii) they decrease by inversion of the poloidal velocity.
Finally for both Gaussian-like velocity components the variation caused by inversion
is greater in the s > 0 region.

4. Summary and Conclusions

In this report tokamak equilibria with reversed magnetic shear and sheared ﬂow have
been studied within the framework of two-ﬂuid model in the limit of inﬁnite aspect ratio.
The study is based on a slightly reduced set of two-ﬂuid equations in which the electron
momentum equation is replaced by the respective MHD one. Neglecting the ﬂow term in
this equation (because in cylindrical geometry it is small for tokamaks) and prescribing
the proﬁles of six free quantities in accord with ITB experimental ones, i.e. the toroidal
magnetic ﬁeld Bz, the safety factor q, the toroidal and poloidal ion velocities viz and viθ,
the density n [Eqs. (13)-(16)] and the ion pressure in terms of the total pressure, Pi =
λP , we have constructed analytic solutions in calculating self consistently the following
quantities: P [and therefore Pi and the electron pressure Pe = (1 − λ)P ], the current
density and the radial electric ﬁeld Er; the electric ﬁeld shear, |E′
r|, and the shear of the
E × B-velocity, ωE×B [Eq. (1)] have also been calculated. Gaussian-like proﬁles for viθ
and either Gaussian-like or peaked-on-axis ones for viz have been considered. In addition,
for reversed magnetic shear proﬁles the impact of s and the ﬂow on the equilibrium
characteristics has been examined by varying the parameters ∆q which |s| is proportional
to, the minimum of q, qmin, its position, rmin, the extrema of the velocity components, viz0
and viθ0, and a parameter h which decreases with increasing velocity shear. The results
are as follows.

1. The pressure proﬁles become steeper in the region of s < 0.

2. The proﬁle of the toroidal current density Jz is hollow and a reversal occurs in the

outer plasma region for s > 2 in connection with appropriate values of ∆q.

3. The |Er| proﬁle has a maximum located close to the qmin position while the |E′
r|
and ωE×B ones have two local maxima the one in the s > 0 and the other in the
s < 0 regions.

9

4. The contributions associated with ∇Pi, viz, and viθ to Er, E′

r and ωE×B (the ∇Pi

contribution being missed in MHD) are of the same order of magnitude.

5. The magnetic shear aﬀects Er and E′

r explicitly through ∇Pi and implicitly in
conjunction with viz; s has an additional impact on ωE×B in connection with viθ. The
explicit impact of s is stronger; in particular for Bz =constant, the ∇Pi contribution
to ωE×B at the point where E′
r = 0 is proportional to (1 − s)(2 − s) [Eq. (20)] while
the contribution through the ﬂow terms is proportional to (1-s) [Eq. (21)].

6. Increase of |s| results in an increase in the maximum of |Er| in all of the cases
considered. Also, the maxima of |E′
r| and ωE×B increase in most of the ﬂow cases
considered. When either the toroidal and poloidal velocity contributions cancel each
other or the velocity is purely toroidal peaked, the increase is greater in the s > 0
region. Also pending on the direction and shape of the ﬂow, the increase varies from
56.4% to 323%.

7. The larger rmin the greater the maxima of |Er|, |E′

r|, and ωE×B.

8. The larger qmin the smaller the maximum of |Er| but the larger the maxima of |E′
r|

and ωE×B in the s > 0 region.

9. Stronger ﬂow, by larger values of |viz0| and |viθ0|, leads to linear increase in Er, |E′

r|,

and ωE×B.

10. The larger the ﬂow shear (by smaller values of the parameter h) the slightly smaller

the maximum of |Er| but the larger the maxima of |E′

r| and ωE×B.

11. Er, E′

r, and ωE×B are sensitive to the relative signs of viz, viθ, and Bz.

In summary, alike MHD, in the framework of two-ﬂuid model the magnetic shear and
sheared ﬂow (toroidal and poloidal) act synergetically on Er, E′
r, and ωE×B which may
play a role in the formation of ITBs. However the impact of magnetic shear on these
quantities is stronger than that in MHD due to the additional ∇Pi contribution to the
aforementioned terms.

Abstract
Ball lightning, also known as ﬁre ball, is a luminous globe which occurs in the course of

a thunderstorm. It has been the object of investigation by ﬁgures in science since the early

nineteenth century. The diﬃcult and long-standing problem of ball lightning has attracted

few meteorologists or atmospheric scientists. Rather, physicists constitute the larger part of

the company studying the atmospheric ﬁre balls.

Taking as model, the two ﬂuid plasma consisting of electrons and one species ions, for

the ﬁre balls physics and considering that the plasma ﬂow is a ﬁnite quantity, we can derive

the equation of relaxed energy state, maintaining the helicity constant, in the form of triple

Beltrami equations for the magnetic ﬁeld:

s

∇ × ∇ × ∇ ×

∇ × ∇ ×

∇ ×

~B + p

~B + q

~B + r ~B = 0

where ~B is the magnetic ﬁeld, s, p, q, and r are constants to be determined through boundary

conditions. This equation is coupled with an equation which describes the hydrodynamic

vortex.

When s = p = 0, we have the Taylor relaxed state of plasma [1], without the ﬂuid ﬂow.

In the case of electron-ion plasma, both s and p are non-zero quantities. In particular, when

electron mass is neglected the results is s = 0 and it describes the Double Beltrami relaxed

minimum energy state as derived by S. M. Mahajan and Z. Yoshida [2]. Its solution is a

spheromak type solution. The problem of the formation of an isolated luminous mass in

the sky and the moderate persistence of the resulting form combined with observations of

ball lightning describing hollow globes, surface coronas and rapid rotation led to theories

depicting ball lightning as a vortex. We explore the solutions of this equation using the

method of Chandrasekhar-Kendall [3] eigenfunctions and appropriate boundary conditions

similar, but more extensive, to the description given by Shukla, Dasgupta and Sakanaka [4].

We will show solutions which might explain the ﬁre ball conﬁgurations.

1. Introduction

Ball lightning is a luminous globe which occurs in the course of a thunderstorm. It has

been the object of investigation by well known scientists since the early nineteenth century.

Although its appearance is very haphazard and far less frequent than ordinary linear light-

ning, it is a source of astonishment when the ﬁre ball is observed in the lower atmosphere,

often entering dwellings while ﬂoating at a leisurely pace. By its random appearances, it

has eluded the measurements with the scientiﬁc instruments. Even photographic captures

of ﬁre balls are rare. However, from the qualitative reports of eye-witnesses reports (now it

numbers in the thousands, particularly from collections from the Soviet Union) the general

properties can be deduced despite the wide variability found in the reports.

Ball lightning makes appearance as ﬂame globe, typically in orange, red-orange or intense

white, and less often in blue, green or yellow. Its dimensions is usually 25-30 cm in diameter,

but much smaller or much larger dimensions are also notiﬁed in the reports (from 1 cm to

10 m and larger). The color of the ball lightning would depend on the current in the channel

as in the experiments in which a weak current gives a bluish glow while increasingly stronger

currents gives dark red, brick red, orange red, and ﬁnally white. Occasionally, the balls move

against the direction of prevailing winds and penetrate window panes without making a hole

in the glass; it is these properties that Ohtsuki and Ofuruton report from their experimental

discharges.

The diﬃcult and long-standing problem of ball lightning has attracted only few meteorol-

ogists or atmospheric scientists. Rather, physicists constitute the larger part of the company

studying the atmospheric ﬁre balls. Numerous theories have been put forward, covering chem-

ical, electrical, nuclear and relativistic models. New states of matter have been proposed to

explain the unusual properties reported for ball lightning.

The problem of the formation of an isolated luminous mass in the sky and the moderate

persistence of the resulting form combined with observations of ball lightning describing

hollow globes, surface coronas, and rapid rotation led to theories depicting ball lightning as

The generation of small vortexes constituting ball lightning in the atmosphere by whirl

winds, cyclones, or tornadoes was suggested following numerous observations of ﬁre balls in

connection with a tornado which appeared at night in France in 1890.

The possibility of a close relationship between the formation of ball lightning and tor-

nadoes has been suggested, The combined action of electrical and hydrodynamic forces in

generating ball lightning as a highly ionized vortex was speciﬁcally adduced in general terms

in 1905.

The magnetic ﬁeld generated by rotation of charged particles in the ring, evidently in

helical paths in its cross section as well as in circular paths around the ring, was suggested to

assist in conﬁnement. The discharge of a large current through a ﬁne wire ring was presented

as a method of generating such a vortex.

The vortex theories provide a very direct explanation of the numerous observations indi-

cating rotation of ball lightning. The formation of luminous globes of this type can be readily

ascribed to either the role of a preliminary linear lightning ﬂash or the hydrodynamic action

of a whirl wind.

Some vortex theories may be classiﬁed equally well as electrical discharge theories and,

especially in the most recent examples, as plasma theories. None of the studies of ball

lightning as a vortex, however, has conclusively dispelled by detailed consideration the serious

diﬃculties on which other theories have founded, such as the continued luminosity of the balls

for long periods while they travel inside structures. If the vortex is to be an isolated, self-

contained sphere, its energy would be expended in viscous drag and turbulence in a very

short time.

We explore the possibilities of relaxed states of plasma for atmospheric plasma with pos-

itive charged particles, and electrons in the form of Triple Beltrami equations. It is shown

that the associated velocity ﬁeld has the similar vortex structure as in the magnetic ﬁeld.

Solutions of this equation is obtained using the method of Chandrasekhar-Kendall eigenfunc-

tions and appropriate boundary conditions similar, but more extensive, to the description

given by Shukla, Dasgupta and Sakanaka [2] . We will show solutions which might explain

the ball lightning conﬁgurations.

It may be pointed out that the solution spectrum of equation (14) is much wider and

richer that those obtained from the solution of the corresponding equation for electron ion

This simple solution shows some remarkable properties of e-i plasma. The pressure proﬁle,

peaking at the axis, shows the self-conﬁning properties of this equilibrium state. Also, the

axial magnetic ﬁeld reverses at the edge, showing the ﬁeld-reversal feature, like that seen

in the Reversed Field Pinch (RFP). Thus, this work demonstrates that e-i plasma, under

appropriate circumstance can behave like a RFP, but with a conﬁning pressure. We believe

that this could open a new direction in activities of e-i plasma, like investigation of vortex

like structures (i.e., spheromak type of closed ﬁeld lines) and many other new and interesting

Initial results from the Madison Dynamo Experiment provide details of the inductive response of
a turbulent ﬂow of liquid sodium to an applied magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld is reconstructed
from measurements both outside and within the ﬂow. Diﬀerential rotation of the ﬂuid generates
a large mean toroidal magnetic ﬁeld from an externally-generated axial ﬁeld through the ω-eﬀect.
Mean poloidal magnetic ﬂux is expelled from the ﬂuid by the poloidal ﬂow. Small-scale, time-varying
magnetic ﬁeld structures are generated by turbulence in the ﬂow. The resulting magnetic power
spectrum exhibits the characteristic power-law scalings expected from Kolmogorov-like turbulence
with an apparent knee at the resistive dissipation scale. Large-scale velocity ﬂuctuations create dy-
namic ﬂow proﬁles that generate intermittent bursts of non-axisymmetric magnetic ﬁelds indicating
that the transition from damped magnetic ﬁelds to growing magnetic ﬁelds is not smooth for a
turbulent ﬂow.

I. BACKGROUND

The

generation of magnetic ﬁelds by ﬂowing
electrically-conducting ﬂuids is a long-standing problem
in plasma physics, astrophysics, and geophysics. Of par-
ticular interest is the role of turbulence in either sup-
porting or suppressing magnetic ﬁelds. Dynamos have
been created in the laboratory by limiting the develop-
ment of turbulence to scales much smaller than the device
size [1, 2]. This scale separation inhibits dynamics due to
large-scale turbulence which can be important in astro-
physical contexts, especially for the transition a ﬂow un-
dergoes to produce a growing magnetic ﬁeld. The Madi-
son Dynamo Experiment was built to characterize these
dynamics.

The experiment, shown in Fig. 1, uses two impellers
to generate a double-vortex ﬂow of liquid sodium in a
1 m diameter spherical vessel. Liquid sodium is used
due to its high conductivity. The choice of a spheri-
cal geometry is motivated by the computational work
of Dudley and James which demonstrated that simple
time-stationary vortices can self-excite at relatively low
speeds [3]. The ﬂow has been measured in hydrodynamic
experiments and is predicted by laminar dynamo the-
ory to generate a transient magnetic ﬁeld [4] by a slow-
dynamo mechanism that stretches and twists magnetic
ﬁeld lines to regenerate the initial seed ﬁeld [5]. Due to
the low Prandtl number of liquid sodium (P r ∼ 10−5)
and the large magnetic Reynolds numbers required for
spontaneous ﬁeld growth (Rmcrit ∼ 102), the ﬂows re-
quired for a dynamo are extremely turbulent (Re ∼ 107).
These types of ﬂows are also studied in experiments at

Maryland [6] and Cadarache [7]. The open geometry of
these experiments provides the opportunity to study the
role of large-scale turbulence in magnetic ﬁeld generation.
The purpose of this correspondence is to provide a de-
scription of the Madison experiment and to report the
initial measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld induced by the
ﬂowing liquid metal. The theory of laminar kinematic
dynamos and hydrodynamic measurements of the ﬂow
are reviewed in Sec. II. The experimental apparatus and
its diagnostics are described in Sec. III. Measurements of
the mean magnetic ﬁeld induced when an external mag-
netic ﬁeld is applied to the turbulent ﬂow are compared
to predictions from the laminar theory in Sec. IV. Mea-
surements of the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations reveal in-
termittent bursts of magnetic ﬁelds and frequency spec-
tra with power-law scaling which are explained in Sec. V.
It is found that turbulence in the ﬂow not only creates
small-scale magnetic ﬁeld structures, but also produces
large-scale intermittent behavior.

II. THE KINEMATIC DYNAMO

an incompressible conducting ﬂuid is governed by the

feedback—the induced ﬁeld must regenerate the initial
seed ﬁeld. Hence, the feedback of the ﬂow can be quan-
tiﬁed by measuring the orientation of the induced ﬁeld
relative to the initial ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁelds induced
in the Madison Dynamo Experiment are characterized in
terms of the gain and feedback to understand the mech-
anism which produces a dynamo.

where the magnetic Reynolds number Rm = µ0σav0 is a
measure of the rate of advection compared to the rate
of diﬀusion (v0 is a characteristic velocity). The relative
importance of the Lorentz force in the ﬂow dynamics is
given by the interaction parameter N = σaB2
0 /ρv0 where
B0 is a characteristic ﬁeld strength. For a kinematic dy-
namo N ≪ 1 so that the velocity ﬁeld evolves indepen-
dently of the magnetic ﬁeld. For a stationary ﬂow, the
induction equation becomes linear and can be solved by
expanding B as

B(r, t) =

Bi(r)eλit,

(4)

Xi

where λi are the growth rates of the magnetic eigenmodes
Bi(r). A dynamo is produced when there is at least one
eigenvalue with a positive real growth rate.

A fundamental requirement for a ﬂow to produce a
dynamo is suﬃciently fast ﬂow speed so that the advec-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld overcomes ohmic dissipation [8].
There is a minimum magnetic Reynolds number Rmcrit
below which resistive diﬀusion dominates the evolution
of the ﬁeld. One measure of how eﬀectively the ﬂow am-
pliﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld is the ratio of the magnitude
of the induced ﬁeld to the magnitude of the initial seed
ﬁeld; this ratio is deﬁned as the gain. As Rm → Rmcrit,
the gain increases indicating stronger ampliﬁcation of the
induced ﬁeld.

B. Experimental ﬂow modeling

Although the impeller-generated ﬂow in the experi-
ment is turbulent, the mean ﬂow can be approximated
by a laminar model. Flows in a spherical geometry are
most easily modeled by the Bullard and Gellman formal-
ism where the velocity ﬁeld is described by a spherical
harmonic expansion of toroidal and poloidal stream func-
tions [9]

rotation rates which creates the odd ﬂow harmonics. (b) The probability distribution function for an LDV measurement of the

performed in an identical-scale water model of the
sodium experiment. Liquid sodium at 105◦C has the
same kinematic viscosity and density as water at 40◦C,
so the ﬂow measured in the water model corresponds to
the sodium ﬂow. Since the ﬂow is turbulent, these pro-
ﬁles are only realized in a mean sense. Fig. 2(b) shows
the probability distribution function for an LDV mea-
surement. The actual ﬂow proﬁles are dynamic, imply-
ing that the eigenmode growth rate ﬂuctuates on the
timescale of the ﬂow evolution. The induced ﬁeld thus ex-

hibits transient behavior, especially for ﬂows near Rmcrit.
The auto-correlation time of the LDV measurements of
the ﬂow is τc = 60 ± 20 ms which serves as an estimate
of the timescale for changes in the ﬂow proﬁle.

An eigenmode analysis of an optimized version of the
hydrodynamic ﬂow suggests that a magnetic ﬁeld should
be generated for Rm ≥ 47 as seen in Fig. 3. The structure
of the magnetic eigenmode with the largest growth rate
for the t2s2 ﬂow is dominated by the S1,1 term in the
expansion of Eq. 6 corresponding to a dipole ﬁeld oriented
perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the ﬂow (note
the ﬁeld lines in the ﬁrst panel of Fig. 4). The generated
ﬁeld breaks the system’s axisymmetry, thereby satisfying
Cowling’s theorem [8].

The physical mechanism of the gain and feedback for
the t2s2 ﬂow is demonstrated by following the evolution
of a ﬁeld line in the frozen-ﬂux approximation (the dif-
fusion term in Eq. 3 is neglected).
In Fig. 4, two ﬁeld
lines parallel to the equatorial plane are stretched to the
poles (located where the drive shafts enter the sphere)
by the poloidal ﬂow and twisted by the toroidal ﬂow
back into their original direction. The induced ﬁeld en-
hances the initial seed ﬁeld thereby increasing its mag-
netic ﬂux. This process continues as tension in the ﬁeld
lines is relieved through magnetic reconnection due to
resistive diﬀusion. Once the magnetic ﬁeld becomes suf-
ﬁciently strong, the interaction parameter becomes large.
The Lorentz force creates a torque on the ﬂow, referred
to as the back reaction, which presumably halts the ﬁeld
growth.

The laminar analysis above may be inadequate for
describing the experiment since turbulence also induces
magnetic ﬁelds. Eddies in the ﬂow distort the magnetic

ﬁeld creating small-scale magnetic ﬁeld structures which
can aﬀect the large-scale induced ﬁeld. Mean ﬁeld theory
suggests that velocity ﬁeld ﬂuctuations can enhance the
resistivity of the ﬂuid by eﬀectively increasing the rate
of diﬀusion (the β-eﬀect) [10], generate large-scale cur-
rents through helical ﬂuid motion (the α-eﬀect) [11], and
reduce the magnetic ﬁeld within the ﬂow due to inhomo-
geneities in the magnitude of turbulent ﬂuctuations (the
γ-eﬀect) [12]. The usual assumptions of homogeneous,
isotropic turbulence and scale separation of ﬂuctuations
from the mean ﬂow are not satisﬁed in the experiment
and so the eﬀects described are only used for conceptual
understanding.

III. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENT

The experiments are performed in a 1 m diameter,
1 cm thick, stainless steel sphere shown in Fig. 1. Liq-
uid sodium is transferred pneumatically from a storage
vessel, located in a vault beneath the ﬂoor, to the sphere
using pressurized argon. The sodium ﬁlls the sphere from
the bottom until the liquid level rises to an expansion
tank connected to the top of the sphere. The expan-
sion tank accommodates changes in the volume of the
sodium due to variation in temperature. The weight of
the sodium in the storage vessel is monitored during the
transfer to determine the liquid level in the sphere. Elec-
trical contact switches in the expansion tank provide a
redundant means of determining the sodium ﬁll level.

The conductivity of liquid sodium varies with tempera-
ture. It has a maximum value of 1.5×107(Ωm)−1 near the
freezing point of sodium (98◦C) and decreases by about
4% for every 10◦C. Since Rm ∝ σ, the sphere is kept at a
temperature of 105–110◦C to optimize Rm without freez-
ing the sodium. The sphere’s temperature is maintained
by a heat exchange system which runs heat-transfer oil
through a series of copper tubes on the sphere’s surface.
The system provides 12 kW of heating and 75 kW of cool-
ing to the oil. Kaowool insulation reduces the sphere’s
ambient heat loss. The heat introduced to the sodium
by the rotating impellers is removed through the surface
of the sphere by the heat exchange system.

Two 30.48 cm diameter impellers generate the ﬂow.
They are driven by 75 kW motors controlled by vari-

able frequency drives (VFDs). The motors rotate the
impellers at rates from 3–30 Hz (Rm is between 18–180).
Since Rmcrit depends on ﬂow geometry, the impellers
have been modiﬁed to produce the desired ﬂow [5]: K¨ort
nozzles limit the radial thrust and ﬁns on the exterior of
the nozzles increase the mean toroidal ﬂow. The mag-
netic Reynolds number Rm is approximated using the
rotation rate of the impellers measured by digital en-
coders. Although convenient, this estimate is generous
in that the speed of the impeller tip is much larger than
that of the bulk ﬂow. The VFDs record torque and power
information. The motor power follows a cubic relation-
ship with rotation rate as shown in Fig. 5. The back re-
action due to magnetic ﬁeld generation will increase the
power required to drive the impellers thereby modifying
the motor power curve.

At atmospheric pressure, the impellers cause cavita-
tion by creating a rapid drop in the local pressure near
the impeller blades, forming bubbles in the ﬂuid. When
the bubbles collapse against the blades, they emit ultra-
sonic noise which is monitored by an ultrasonic trans-
ducer mounted to the sphere. Since these bubbles dis-
rupt the ﬂow through the impellers, the cavitation must
be suppressed; this is accomplished by pressurizing the
sphere with argon gas. The required pressurization is

determined empirically by increasing the sphere pressure
until the ultrasonic noise is minimized. For example, to
operate at a rotation rate of 20 Hz the sphere must be
pressurized to 550 kPa (80 psi).

Two sets of coils generate magnetic ﬁelds used to study
the induction eﬀects of the ﬂow. One set is coaxial with
the drive shafts, the other orthogonal, as shown in Fig 1.
A DC power supply provides the coils with 600 A to gen-
erate ﬁelds up to 100 G. The coils can produce dipole,
quadrupole, transverse dipole, and transverse quadrupole
ﬁeld conﬁgurations. For ﬂow speeds of 10 m/s, the inter-
action parameter is N = 10−3 hence the magnetic ﬁeld
is advected passively by the ﬂow.

The magnetic ﬁeld is measured using Hall-eﬀect probes
(Analog Devices AD22151 Linear Output Magnetic Field
Sensors) on integrated circuits with internal temperature
compensation. The probes saturate at ±200 G and are
low-pass ﬁltered to match the 1 kHz skin-eﬀect frequency
of the stainless steel sphere. Probes are positioned on a
grid on the surface of the sphere capable of resolving
spherical harmonic modes up to a polar order of 7 and
an azimuthal order of 5. Linear arrays of probes in stain-
less steel tubes are inserted radially into the sphere and
are oriented to measure either axial or toroidal magnetic
ﬁelds. Data from the magnetic probes is sampled by 16-
bit digitizers on PC-based data acquisition cards at a rate
of 1 kHz per channel. The stainless steel tubes encasing
the internal sensor arrays vibrate when the impellers are
driven at rotation rates above 15 Hz (Rm = 90). The
amplitude of the vibrations increases with ﬂow speed so
experiments are limited to the lower rotation rates to pre-
vent damaging the tubes and risking a breach. A compar-
ison of data from experiments before the internal arrays
were installed with data from experiments with the tubes
indicates that the disturbance in the ﬂow due to the tubes
has negligible eﬀect on the large-scale induced magnetic
ﬁeld. Future experiments will be performed without the
internal sensor arrays to reach higher rotation rates.

IV. MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS

A. Reconstruction of the mean magnetic ﬁeld

The induction eﬀects are studied by applying an axial
magnetic ﬁeld to both ﬂowing and stationary sodium and
comparing the measured ﬁelds. The ﬂow’s diﬀerential ro-
tation wraps the ﬁeld lines around the drive shaft axis to
produce a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld through the so-called ω-
eﬀect, as seen in Fig. 6(a). The contour plot is generated
by ﬁtting the coeﬃcients of the harmonic expansion in
Eq. 6 to toroidal ﬁeld measurements (up to order ℓ = 3).
The ω-eﬀect is very eﬃcient at amplifying the magnetic
ﬁeld; measurements of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld shown
in Fig. 6(b) indicate that the induced toroidal ﬁeld in-
creases with Rm and is larger than the applied ﬁeld for
Rm = 120. In contrast, Fig. 6 shows that the axial mag-
netic ﬁeld in the equatorial plane is halved due to ﬂux

5

expulsion from the intense shear layer between the two
large ﬂow cells.

The mean ﬁeld structure shown in Fig. 6(a) is obtained
by an averaging procedure which calculates the peak of
the histogram of magnetic ﬁeld measurements from each
probe. This technique is necessary since some of the
probes have non-Gaussian statistics (discussed in Sec. V).
The resulting mean ﬁeld is predominantly due to odd har-
monics in accordance with the selection rules governing
the interaction terms of the induction equation [9]. The
presence of small even harmonics could be an indication
that the ﬂow is asymmetric across the equator due to
an imbalance of the impeller rotation rates or possibly a
turbulent EMF.

The magnetic ﬁeld outside the sphere is reconstructed
from the ﬁeld harmonics calculated from the surface ar-
ray measurements. The poloidal ﬂux lines are shown in
Fig. 6(a). Since the Hall probes on the surface of the
sphere lie outside regions containing currents, the mea-
sured ﬁeld can be described in terms of a spherical har-
monic expansion of the vacuum ﬁeld potential

The external measured magnetic ﬁeld can be completely
described in terms of these expansion coeﬃcients. To
determine the coeﬃcients for a given set of magnetic ﬁeld
measurements, a design matrix Aij is constructed which
satisﬁes

Bi = Aij Dj

(10)

where Bi is an array of measurements of the induced ﬁeld
and Dj is the array of expansion coeﬃcients in (9). The
coeﬃcients are obtained by matrix inversion using Sin-
gular Value Decomposition [13] to solve Dj = (Aij )−1Bi.
Time series measurements from several probes are shown
in Fig. 7(a) along with plots of the computed axisym-
metric modes at θ = 0 in Fig. 7(b). The dipole com-
ponent of the induced magnetic ﬁeld grows non-linearly
with Rm and cannot be explained by induction eﬀects
from the mean ﬂow. The dipole response results from a
turbulent EMF generated by correlated turbulent ﬂuctu-
ations in the ﬂow [14].

B. Measuring gain with a transverse applied ﬁeld

The proximity of the ﬂow to magnetic self-excitation is
studied by applying a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the
drive shaft axis. Recall from Sec. II that the anticipated
structure of the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the dynamo
is a dipole oriented in this direction. Fig. 3(b) suggests
that such a ﬁeld should be ampliﬁed by the ﬂow. The
level of ampliﬁcation depends both on the magnitude of
the induced ﬁeld and on its orientation. Therefore the
gain is deﬁned as

gain =

Binduced cos δ + Bapplied
Bapplied

(11)

where the ﬁeld magnitudes are calculated for the ℓ = 1,
m = 1 expansion term in Eq. 9 and δ is the azimuthal
phase diﬀerence between the applied and induced ﬁelds.
The gain is less than one if the induced ﬁeld is antiparallel
to the applied ﬁeld, indicating attenuation, and is greater
than one if the ﬁelds are in phase. The gain is determined
from measurements of the induced magnetic ﬁeld and is
shown to increase with Rm in Fig. 8(a). Fig. 8(b) shows

that the induced ﬁeld is out of phase with the applied ﬁeld
at low Rm and improves as Rm increases. These gain and
phase angle measurements will be used to optimize the
ﬂow proﬁles in the sodium experiment.

V. PROPERTIES OF MHD TURBULENCE

The preceding analysis documents the large-scale in-
duced mean ﬁeld. Since the ﬂow is turbulent and the
magnetic ﬁeld relatively weak, eddies can twist and
stretch ﬁeld lines at many scales. While smaller eddies
are advected by the mean ﬂow, larger eddies distort the
large-scale ﬂow itself causing intermittent behavior in the
induced ﬁeld. Fig. 9 shows signals from two Hall probes
on the surface of the sphere and their probability distri-
bution functions (PDFs). In addition to random ﬂuctu-

FIG. 9: (a) Measurement from a single Hall probe on the surface of the sphere near the equator and (b) its probability
distribution. The impeller rotation rate for this example is 16.7 Hz (Rm = 100) and a 60 G dipole ﬁeld is applied. A Gaussian
ﬁt to the right side of the distribution is shown (dotted line) to illustrate the asymmetry. The time series for a probe near the
drive shaft axis (c) with its probability distribution (d) is shown for comparison.

mal statistics. Examination of the structure of the mag-
netic ﬁeld during the bursts reveals a strong m = 1 mode
shown in Fig. 10. The large-scale turbulent ﬂow thus in-
duces an axisymmetric ﬁeld on average punctuated by
intermittent bursts that break the symmetry.

Eddies at the smaller scales create structure in the
magnetic ﬁeld down to the viscous dissipation scale [15].
This structure is evident in the spatial spectrum in
Fig. 11. The k−5/3 scaling corresponds to the weak-ﬁeld
approximation in which the induced ﬁeld is balanced by
the advection term in the induction equation [7, 16]. The
magnetic ﬁeld can be described in terms of a mean and

Fig. 9(a) has large-amplitude bursts which skew its PDF
shown in Fig. 9(b). The time average of the signal for

The dissipation scale is evident from the knee in the
wave number spectrum of Fig. 11. The spatial spectrum
is constructed from the power spectrum of a Hall probe
which measures the toroidal ﬁeld just above one of the
impellers. The results are summarized in Tab. I show-
ing that kσ increases with Rm. Consequently, the mag-
netic ﬁeld gains structure at smaller scales as Rm in-
creases, down to scale sizes of ℓσ = 2π/kσ = 16 cm at
Rm = 100. A magnetic Reynolds number for the tur-
bulent part of the ﬂow can be constructed assuming that
kσ = Rmturbk0. Using the values in Tab. I, it can be
shown that Rmturb = 0.2Rmtip where Rmtip is based
on the tip speed of the impeller. This relation im-
plies that the turbulent eddies produced by the mean
ﬂow are smaller and slower than the injection-scale ed-
dies and hence the dissipation scale is only about one
decade smaller than the injection scale rather than the
two decades expected for a ﬂow with Rm ∼ 100.

response of a Hall probe inside the sphere (just above the
impeller near the toroidal maximum in Fig. 6). Fluctuations
are assumed to be due to convection of spatial variations in
the ﬁeld. The dispersion relation is ω = kv0 where v0 is
determined from velocity measurements in the water model
of the sodium experiment.

VI. CONCLUSION

kσ = µ0σv0 = Rm/a. At scales k ≪ kσ, the dissipa-
tion term is small. Thus, magnetic ﬂuctuations are due
to advection of the mean ﬁeld by velocity ﬂuctuations
and so

The magnetic ﬁeld induced by a turbulent ﬂow of liq-
uid sodium demonstrates ﬂux expulsion and the ω-eﬀect
as anticipated for a laminar ﬂow. The ﬂow generated
in the experiment induces a ﬁeld that provides the gain
and feedback necessary for a dynamo. Power spectrum
measurements show that the resistive dissipation scale is
proportional to Rm. Since turbulence is allowed to de-
velop to the large scales, the ﬂow proﬁles are dynamic and
excite intermittent bursts of symmetry-breaking ﬁelds.
Consequently, as a ﬂow nears Rmcrit, the transition to
a dynamo is expected to be intermittent rather than
smooth.

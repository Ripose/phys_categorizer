The tremendous applications of terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and imaging require THz sources
in diﬀerent parameters. We propose a novel scheme to generate single-cycle powerful THz pulses by
ultrashort intense laser pulses incident obliquely on a tenuous plasma slab of few THz wavelengths
in thickness. This is made possible by driving a large amplitude electron plasma wave in the plasma
slab, thus producing a net transient current at the plasma surfaces. Theory and simulations show
that such a THz source is capable of providing megawatt power and ﬁeld strength of MV/cm, which
may open up new horizons for nonlinear THz science and applications.

Terahertz spectroscopy can probe the spectral prop-
erties of molecules in a previously inaccessible electro-
magnetic spectrum [1]. Its applications include the char-
acterization of semiconductors [2] and high-temperature
superconductors [3], T-ray imaging of biomedical tis-
sues [4], cellular structures [5] and dielectric substances
[6], and the manipulation of bound atoms [7]. Most
applications are based on the techniques of THz time-
domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) [1], where typically co-
herent broadband THz pulses in the 2-5 THz frequency
bandwidth are employed. Most broadband pulsed THz
sources are based on the excitation of diﬀerent materials
with ultrashort laser pulses [1], such as through photo-
conduction or optical rectiﬁcation, but the output power
is limited by the damage threshold of the optical materi-
als used.

So far, there have been no development in the non-
linear regime due to the lack of suﬃciently high power
THz sources [1]. To address this problem a few eﬀorts
have been made using ultrashort electron bunches pro-
duced by lasers or accelerators through the mechanisms
of transition radiation and/or synchrotron radiation [8].
Recently, by four-wave mixing in air with a laser inten-
sity of ∼1014 W/cm2, single-cycle THz pulses with a ﬁeld
strength greater than kV/cm can be produced [9], after
the laser ﬁeld-ionization and plasma generation thresh-
old is surpassed. Whether this kind of THz emission will
saturate for light intensities >1015 W/cm2 is an open
question.

For light intensities ≫1014 W/cm2, the leading part
of the laser pulse can completely ionize the material and
the interaction process becomes a pure laser-plasma in-
teraction. Plasma has no thermal damage threshold and
can sustain extremely intense light. The peak intensity
of lasers today can be as high as 1020 W/cm2 and in the
future is expected to reach 1023 W/cm2 [10]. Exploring
new THz emission mechanisms in the context of intense

laser plasma interactions may produce higher power THz
sources. It has been shown that laser wakeﬁelds (elec-
tron plasma waves driven by the ponderomotive force
of a laser pulse) in inhomogeneous plasmas can radiate
high-eﬃciency THz waves at high power through linear
mode conversion [11, 12]. The THz pulses produced in
this way are generally in multi-cycles and have a negative
frequency chirp.

The present work introduces a new THz emission
mechanism in laser plasma interaction, which can di-
rectly generate a single-cycle THz pulse with a ﬁeld
strength comparable with our earlier proposal [11, 12]. In
addition to the above applications, the single-cycle pulse
has special implications for THz propagation physics and
seismic surveys [13]. In the one-dimensional (1D) case,
an electron plasma wave [14] in a uniform plasma is de-
scribed by δn = δnp exp[i(kpx − ωpt)], where δnp is the
ne2/mε0 is the
density perturbation amplitude, ωp =
plasma frequency of the background plasma of density
n, −e and m are the electron charge and mass respec-
tively, and kp = ωp/c = 2π/λp, where λp is the plasma
wavelength. This inﬁnite plasma wave can never emit
electromagnetic waves at frequency ωp, since its dis-
placement current (ε0∂E/∂t) exactly compensates the
plasma current (−env). However, for a ﬁnite plasma
wave of length L ∼ λp, there could be some electro-
magnetic radiation. Firstly, for such a few-wavelength
plasma oscillator, its displacement and plasma currents
cannot completely counteract each other, in particular
near the plasma boundaries. Secondly, since the plasma
skin depth of the radiation at frequency ωp is k−1
p , which
is comparable to the plasma length L, the radiation can
tunnel through the plasma into vacuum. Figure 1(a) is a
schematic of this THz wave emission mechanism.

In the following we give a theoretical analysis of this
THz emission mechanism. For the interaction geome-
try shown in Fig. 1(a), by Lorentz transformations we
transform all the physical quantities from the laboratory
frame to a moving frame of velocity c sin θey, where ey is
the unit vector along the y direction. An electromag-
netic wave with ωL = ω′, kL = (±k′ cos θ, k′ sin θ, 0)

in the laboratory frame becomes ωM = ω′ cos θ, kM =
(±k′ cos θ, 0, 0) in the moving frame, wherein all the elec-
tromagnetic waves propagate along the ±x directions,
i.e. THz emission in the laboratory frame must be in
the specular reﬂection and laser transmission directions.
Plasma (electrons and ions) in the moving frame streams
along −ey, with a relativistic factor γM = 1/ cos θ. Fol-
lowing Ref. [15] and using the quasi-static approximation
[16], we obtain the coupled equations (in SI units)

where L is the plasma length, ω the laser frequency,

ways p-polarized. In the weakly relativistic case φ << 1,
Eqs. (2) and (3) lead to δn ∝ a2

sion process, we assume γ ≃ γM. Substituting these into
Eq. (4) we obtain

for L ∼ λp. From Eq. (5) we can see that there is no
THz emission for normal incidence (θ = 0), since there is
no transverse electric ﬁeld component.

To test our proposal and the scaling rule in Eq. (5)
we conduct a series of 1D particle-in-cell (PIC) simula-
tions. Taking into account the oblique incidence of the
laser beam, our 1D-PIC code adopts a moving frame as
discussed above [15] and outputs all physics quantities
in the laboratory frame. The initial plasma density is
taken to be n = 0.0001nc, where nc = mε0ω2/e2 =
1.1 × 1021(µm/λ)2 cm−3 is the critical density for the
laser pulse of wavelength λ in vacuum. For λ = 1 µm,

2

p

n = 1.1 × 1017 cm−3. The corresponding plasma fre-
quency is ωp/2π = 2.98 THz, which represents the central
frequency of the THz emission. The plasma wavelength
is λp =
nc/nλ = 100λ. The incident laser pulse has a
sine-square proﬁle aL = eEL/mωc = a0 sin2[π(x−ct)/dL]
for 0 ≤ x − ct ≤ dL, where dL is the laser pulse du-
ration. Here a0 is related to the peak laser intensity
through I = a2
0 · 1.37 × 1018(µm/λ)2 W/cm2. The rel-
ativistic intensity threshold is reached at a0 = 1. The
laser pulse enters the left boundary of the simulation box
with s polarization in order to distinguish it easily from
the p-polarized THz emission from the wakeﬁeld. For the
sine-square laser pulse, the excited wakeﬁeld amplitude is
maximum when dL ≈ λp [12]. The simulation results also
conﬁrm that the THz emission is strongest for dL = λp,
thus we always set dL = λp in the following.

Deﬁning ﬁelds F± = (Ey ± cBz)/2 in the moving
frame, we see that F+ and F− represent the forward
and backward p-polarized electromagnetic waves, respec-
tively. Tracing F+ and F− at the right and left bound-
aries of the simulation box, we can obtain the tempo-
ral proﬁle of the radiated THz pulses in the reﬂection
and transmission directions. Figure 1(b) shows the peak
ﬁeld strengths |F±|max of the THz pulses as a function
of the plasma length L. The laser pulse parameters are
a0 = 0.5, dL = 100λ and θ = 45o. The incident laser in-
tensity is about 3.4 × 1017 W/cm2 (λ = 1 µm). We ﬁnd
that the plasma length L should be within [0.25λp, 2.7λp]
for intense THz pulses to be generated. When L ≥ 3λp,
the THz pulse amplitude decreases dramatically.

We also ﬁnd that the radiated THz pulse is single-
cycle. Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show the time evolution of
ﬁeld components Ex and Bz in the x space for L = 100λ.
The ﬁeld Ex in Fig. 1(c) includes the longitudinal ﬁeld
of the wakeﬁeld and the electric ﬁeld of the p-polarized
THz emission. The wakeﬁeld is completely localized in
the plasma region, while the electric ﬁeld of the THz
wave is mainly outside the plasma slab. In Fig. 1(d) Bz
is the pure magnetic ﬁeld of the THz wave. It is obvious
that two single-cycle THz pulses are radiated from the
plasma region. Due to the propagation delay of the laser
pulse, the pulse in the backward (reﬂection) direction is
generated earlier than that in the forward (transmission)
direction. For the speciﬁc laser wavelength λ = 1 µm
in Fig. 1(d), the ﬁeld strength is found to be above 10
MV/cm. When L ≥ 3λp, the THz pulse is no longer
single-cycle.

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate the temporal proﬁles
of the THz pulses shown in Figs. 1(c) and 2(d) together
with two other incident angles of 30o and 60o. The shape
of the transmitted THz wave F+ is the same as that of
the reﬂected F−. For θ = 30o, the THz pulses have
two cycles. Single-cycle THz emission is produced when
θ ≥ 45o. With increasing incident angle, the number of
cycles included in the THz pulse decreases. Figure 2(c)
displays the power spectra of the THz pulses F−. The
central frequency is at 3 THz (λ = 1 µm). The spec-
trum width increases with the incident angle, because of

tional High-Tech ICF Committee in China, and the

the shorter THz duration for the larger θ. The band-
widths approach 3-6 THz, meeting the requirements for
the THz-TDS system. Figure 2(d) shows that the peak
ﬁeld strengths |F±|max are proportional to sin θ, which
agrees with Eq. (5). There is no THz emissions for θ = 0.
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show that the THz ﬁeld strength
is proportional to both the laser intensity, i.e. a2
L, and the
square root of the plasma density n. At lower intensities
of 1014-1015 W/cm2, the THz ﬁeld strength is several
tens of kV/cm, comparable to that generated through
four-wave mixing in air [9] under the same intensities.

The above 1D theoretical analysis and 1D-PIC simu-
lations are valid as long as the laser spot size is large
compared with the plasma wavelength. For a laser beam
with a Gaussian proﬁle exp(−r2/w2
L) in transverse space,
the 1D model applies for wL ≫ λp. It is easily under-
stood that, for wL < λp, the radiation source size is
smaller than the radiated wavelength, so that the gen-
erated THz wave will diﬀract dramatically. In order to
have collimated THz emission, wL ≫ λp should be main-
tained.

To illustrate the multi-dimensional properties of the
THz emission, Fig. 4 shows the THz emission in a 2D-
PIC simulation.
It is found that there are indeed two
single-cycle THz pulses in the reﬂection and transmission
directions. For λ = 1 µm, the THz ﬁeld strength is 42
MV/cm, i.e. an intensity of 2.5 × 1012 W/cm2. Since
the radiation radius is about 30µm, this is equivalent to
a peak power of 70 MW.

A uniform plasma slab several tens of microns long can
be readily formed from the gas jet targets commonly used
in high-harmonic generation experiments [17]. Mean-
while, our numerical simulations show that THz pulses
emitted from a nonuniform plasma with a trapezoid den-
sity proﬁle are similar to those from a uniform plasma
slab, provided that the ascending and decending parts of
the trapezoid are also at the THz wavelength scale. This
suggests that the density homogeneity of the plasma slab
is not necessary.

To conclude, we have presented a method for pro-
ducing single-cycle high power THz radiation from
wavelength-scale plasma oscillators (L ∼ λp). It is emit-
ted by the transient net currents induced at the plasma
surfaces while building-up the plasma oscillators. This
mechanism together with that for THz emission by lin-
ear mode conversion in inhomogeneous plasmas (L ≫ λp)
[11, 12] provide a complete picture for interpreting the
early experimental observation of THz emission in in-
tense laser plasma interaction [18].

Kinetics of a Model Weakly Ionized Plasma
in the Presence of Multiple Equilibria

by
E. Carlen1, R. Esposito2, J.L. Lebowitz3, R. Marra4 and A. Rokhlenko3

Abstract: We study, globaly in time, the velocity distribution f (v, t) of a spa-
tially homogeneous system that models a system of electrons in a weakly ionized
plasma, subjected to a constant external electric ﬁeld E. The density f satisﬁes
a Boltzmann type kinetic equation containing a full nonlinear electron-electron
collision term as well as linear terms representing collisions with reservoir parti-
cles having a speciﬁed Maxwellian distribution. We show that when the constant
in front of the nonlinear collision kernel, thought of as a scaling parameter, is
suﬃciently strong, then the L1 distance between f and a certain time dependent
Maxwellian stays small uniformly in t. Moreover, the mean and variance of this
time dependent Maxwellian satisfy a coupled set of nonlinear ODE’s that consti-
tute the “hydrodynamical” equations for this kinetic system. This remain true
even when these ODE’s have non-unique equilibria, thus proving the existence of
multiple stabe stationary solutions for the full kinetic model. Our approach relies
on scale independent estimates for the kinetic equation, and entropy production
estimates. The novel aspects of this approach may be useful in other problems
concerning the relation between the kinetic and hydrodynamic scales globably in
time.

1. Introduction

The mathematical understanding of equilibrium phenomena has greatly advanced in
the past few decades. The elegant and precise theory of Gibbs measures provides a di-
rect bridge between the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of such systems. This
includes a general conceptual framework as well as nontrivial explicit examples of the
coexistence of multiple equilibrium phases for certain values of the macroscopic control
parameters.

There is no comparable general theory for nonequilibrium systems and the micro-
scopic study of phase transition phenomena in such situations appears to be far beyond
our mathematical grasp at the present time. Our mathematical understanding of the great

variety of nonequilibrium phase transitions observed in ﬂuids, plasmas, lasers, etc., there-
fore depends entirely on the study of bifurcations and other singular phenomena occurring
in the nonlinear equations describing the macroscopic time evolution of such systems.

While there has been much progress recently in deriving such equations from simple
microscopic and even realistic mesoscopic model evolutions the passage to the macroscopic
scale is well understood only over time intervals in which the solutions of the macroscopic
equations stay smooth. This is true for example in the passage from kinetic theory, where
the evolution is described by the Boltzmann equation, to hydrodynamics, where it is
described by either the compressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, depending on how
we choose our macroscopic time scale [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These derivations, which are
based on Chapman-Enskog type expansions, require for their validity the uniqueness and
smoothness of the solutions of the hydrodynamic equations. The reason for this is that
control of the error terms in the estimates depends on a-priori smoothness estimates for
solutions of the macroscopic equations. Thus, they shed no light on the actual behavior
of the mesoscopic description when the solution of the hydrodynamical equations develop
singular behavior.

To overcome this problem it is clearly desirable to develop methods in which one does
not use any a-priori smoothness estimates for solutions of the macroscopic equations, but
instead uses scale independent estimates on the mesoscopic equation. This is what we do
here for a simple model inspired by plasma physics [7, 8, 9].

Our starting point is a kinetic theory description of the system. Grave diﬃculties are
posed by the fact that as of yet, not very much is known in the way of a-priori regularity
estimates for solutions of the spatially inhomogeneous Boltzmann equation. This is quite
diﬀerent however, from the lack of estimates for the macroscopic equations – there it is
clear that in the interesting cases the desired estimates just don’t exist. Shock waves do
form. In the Boltzmann case however, it is likely that a-priori regularity estimates in the
velocity variables, say, invariant under the Euler scaling, are there, but simply have not
yet been discovered. Still, the lack of such estimates is a grave diﬃculty in the way of
rigorous investigation of the problem at hand.

We sidestep this diﬃculty by considering a spatially homogeneous system, but one that
is driven by an electric ﬁeld, and coupled to heat reservoirs. In this case the usual hydro-
dynamic moments are not conserved and the system will have non-equilibrium stationary
states. We prove then in a certain simpliﬁed, but still recognizable physical situations, that
the kinetic description closely tracks the macroscopic description even when the driving
is suﬃciently strong for the latter to undergo phase transitions. More precisely, we show
that the velocity distribution function is close to a Maxwellian parametrized by a tem-
perature T and mean velocity u which satisfy certain non-linear equations, which are the
macroscopic equations for this system. Moreover, it does so globally in time, even when
the stationary solutions of these macroscopic equations are nonunique.

We are in fact particularly concerned with the stability of of these stationary solutions
– the existence of multiple stationary states being analogous to the coexistence of phases
in equilibrium systems. For such questions we need results that guarantee that a solution
of the kinetic equations will stay near a solution of the macroscopic equations globaly in
time. This seems to be diﬃcult to accomplish by standard expansion methods, at least

2

in the range of driving ﬁeld strengths where the macroscopic equations have the most
interesting behavior. Instead of expansion methods, we use entropy production [10, 11]
to show that the solution of the kinetic equations must stay close to some Maxwellian,
globally in time. Then, we show that the moments of this Maxwellian must nearly satisfy
the macroscopic equations. In this way we get our results. The next section speciﬁes the
model more closely, and states our main results. A preliminary account of this work in
which the Boltzmann collisions were modeled by a BGK collision kernel was presented in
[12].

2. The model and the results

Our formal set up is as follows: We consider a weakly ionized gas in IR3 in the
presence of an externally imposed constant electric ﬁeld E. The density of the gas, the
degree of ionization and the strength of the ﬁeld are assumed to be such that: (i) the
interactions between the electrons can be described by some nonlinear, Boltzmann type
collision operator, and (ii) collisions between the electrons and the heavy components of
the plasma, ions and neutrals, are adequately described by assuming the latter ones to have
a spatially homogeneous time independent Maxwellian distribution with an a proiri given
temperature [7]. Under these conditions the time evolution of the spatially homogeneous
velocity distribution function f (v, t) will satisfy a Boltzmann type equation

∂f (v, t)
∂t

= −E · ∇f + Lf + ǫ−1Q(f ),

(2.1)

where ∇ is the gradient with respect to v in IR3, E is a constant force ﬁeld and Q is a
nonlinear collision term which will take either the form of the Boltzmann collision kernel
for Maxwellian molecules, or the one corresponding to the BGK model. We treat both
cases here because it is possible to provide a little more detail concerning the nature of
the equilibria in the BGK case. The parameter ǫ > 0 is thought of as a scaling parameter
that goes to zero in the hydrodynamical limit. The linear operator L represents the eﬀect
of collisions with reservoir particles. It will be assumed to have the form:

Lf (v) = L1f (v) + L2f (v),

L1f (v) = ∇ ·

D(v)M (v)∇

M (v) = (2π)−3/2 exp(−|v|2/2)

D(v) = a exp(−b|v|2/2) + c

(2.4)

for some strictly positive constants a, b and c: the symbols a, b, c shall henceforth always
refer to these parameters wherever they appear. The speciﬁc form (2.4) of the velocity
space diﬀusion coeﬃcient is not important. We specify it for sake of concreteness. The
properties we really need for D(v) will be clear from the proofs. The operator L2 represents
momentum exchanges with the heavy reservoir particles and is given by

L2f (v) = ν[ ¯f (v) − f (v)],

with ν a positive constant and ¯f (v) the sphericalized average of f (v).

For any probability density f , we shall let Mf denote the Maxwellian density with

the same ﬁrst and second moments as f . Explicitly,

With either QBGK or QB for the collision kernel in (2.1), this term tends to keep f close
to Mf , and one could certainly expect this eﬀect to dominate for small values of ǫ. Thus,
formally in the limit as ǫ vanishes, f will actually equal Mf for all time t, and to keep
track of its evolution, we need only keep track of u(t) and e(t).

Using the prescription f = Mf , in the right side of (2.1), one easily evaluates the time

derivative of the ﬁrst two moments of the so modiﬁed (2.1), to obtain formally

where β = T −1 and w = bu2/2(1 + bT ). The tildes in (2.14) are to remind us that the
equation is valid only when f = Mf .

Equations (2.14) represent the hydrodynamical description of the gas. Our primary
goal here is to show that such a description actually does hold for small, but positive,
values of ǫ, i.e. that the interaction between the hydrodynamic and the non–hydrodynamic
modes does not destroy the picture involving only the hydrodynamic modes. The following
theorem enables us to do this.

Theorem 2.1. Let f be a solution of (2.1) with

f (·, 0) = Mf (·,0) .

Then, for any ﬁxed integer k0 > 0, there is an ǫ0 > 0 and functions δ1(ǫ), δ2(ǫ), going to
zero as ǫ → 0, depending only on a, b, c, |E| and e(0), such that for ǫ < ǫ0 the solution of
(2.1) satisﬁes

and

for k ≤ k0.

Remark: The assumption on f (·, 0) is not essential: our methods allow us to easily modify
the result to take into account an initial layer.

We shall use Theorem 2.1, in the proof of Theorem 2.2 below, that if we compute
u(t) and e(t) for a solution f of (2.1) satisfying the conditions of Theorem 2.1, then the
moments of f will satisfy the equation,

(cid:18)

(2.19)

where F and G are the non–linear functions of u and e given by (2.15) and (2.16), that arise
in the ǫ = 0 limit, and γ(t) and η(t) are bounded uniformly in t with a bound independent
of ǫ. Of course they depend on the full solution f of (2.1), but such estimates and a simple
comparison argument will then lead to the following theorem, which says that the system
(2.14) obtained in the ǫ → 0 limit does give an accurate picture of the small ǫ regime.

Theorem 2.2 Let (u∗, e∗) be a stable ﬁxed point of the system (2.14) and let M(u∗,ǫ∗) be
the corresponding Maxwellian density, with moments u∗ and e∗. Then given any δ > 0,
there is an ǫ greater than zero such that if fǫ(·, t) solves (2.1) with this value of ǫ and

then

for all t ≥ 0.

kfǫ(·, 0) − M(u∗,e∗)(·)kL1(IR3) ≤ ǫ

kfǫ(·, t) − M(u∗,e∗)(·)kL1(IR3) ≤ δ

If, however, (u∗, e∗) is not stable, then there exist a δ > 0 so that for every ǫ > 0,

there is a solution fǫ(·, t) of (2.1) with Maxwellian initial data satisfying

but such that for some ﬁnite t > 0

kfǫ(·, 0) − M(u∗,e∗)(·)kL1(IR3) ≤ ǫ ,

kfǫ(·, t) − M(u∗,e∗)(·)kL1(IR3) ≥ δ .

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

The proof of these theorems, which are fairly complicated even for the simple BGK

model will be given in the next sections.

The above theorems allow us to rigorously prove that our kinetic system has multiple
equilibria in certain ranges of the parameters that specify it. This is because of the following
result concerning the “hydrodynamic” system (2.14).

Proposition 2.3 There are choices of the parameters a, b, c and ν for which there are
nonempty intervals (E0, E1) such that, if |E| is outside of the closed interval [E0, E1], then
there is unique stable ﬁxed point for the system (2.14), while, if |E| ∈ (E0, E1) then there

6

are three ﬁxed points for the system (2.14). Moreover two of them are stable and one is
unstable.

Stability here is meant in the sense that the eigenvalues of the diﬀerential have a

strictly negative real part.

The proof of Proposition 2.3 is an explicit calculation which we omit (see [7]). However,
to gain an intuitive understanding of why there should be multiple stable equilibria for
certain parameter ranges, think of the ǫ = 0 limit of (2.1) as a constrained motion on the
“manifold of Maxwellians”. Without this constraint, which is generated by the collision
kernel, the evolution would be the one ruled by the electric ﬁeld and the linear operator
L. Clearly, this evolution has an unique attracting ﬁxed point, which, for a > 0, is not
Maxwellian. What happens is that there are one or more places on the non-linear constraint
manifold that are locally closest to the attracting point of the unconstrained system. Each
of these is a stable equilibrium for the constrained evolution. As the parameters are varied,
the position of the unconstrained ﬁxed point relative to the manifold of Maxwellians varies,
and with this variation in geometry, the number of locally closest points varies.

The main physical issues regarding this model are sttled at this point: We have proved
the existence of the multiple stable equilibria at the kinetic level – ǫ small, but positve
– that had been found and investigated in [7] at ǫ = 0. Moreover, we remind the reader
that we do not know how to establish such a result using conventional expansion methods:
the diﬃculty being that if E is not small, and hence possibly out of the range where
multiple equilibria exist for (2.14), we only know how to prove (2.21) locally in time. This
is insuﬃcient to show that for ǫ small enough, one never wanders far from any M(u∗,e∗)
with (u∗, e∗) stable for (2.14). While the entropy methods we use do let us do this for
arbitrary E, there are several ﬁner question that one could ask, but for which we have only
incomplete answers.

First, one can ask whether or not there is an actual stationary solution inside the
invariant neighborhoods that we have found of the M(u∗,e∗), and second, once one knows
that stationary solutions exist, one can ask whether or not solutions actually tend to
converge to one of these stationary solutions as t tends to inﬁnity.

The ﬁrst question we can answer comletely only in the BGK case. The positive answer

is given by:

Theorem 2.4

Let Q = QBGK and a > 0. Then for each ﬁxed point of (2.14) there is exactly one
stationary solution of eq. (2.1). This solution lies in a suitably smalll neighborhood of
Mu∗,e∗, the Maxwellian corresponding to (u∗, e∗), and it inherits the stability properties of
the hydrodynamical ﬁxed point.

For the Boltzmann kernel we have only a partial result that is reported in Section 8.
Also on the question of convergence we have only very partial results. These are reported
in Section 9, where the diﬃculties are explained as well. But though it would be desirable
to have a more complete resolution of these issues, they are not central to establishing
that the kinetic systems does actually have the several stable regimes that one sees in the
limiting “hydrodynamic” equations.

7

The proofs are organized as follows. In Section 3 we prove moment bounds. Section
4 contains the proof of two “interpolation inequalities”. The ﬁrst of these will be used to
obtain a–priori smoothness bounds in Section 5. The second will be used to transform the
smoothness bounds of Section 5 into a lower bound on the variance of our density. The
smoothness requires Sobolev estimates for the collision kernel, which are straightforward
for QBGK , while for QB they rely on some recent results [13], which we simply state here.
Having assembled these moment, smoothness and interpolation bounds, we can use a key
entropy production inequality for QB proved in [11]. The analogous inequality for QBGK
is proven in a simpler way in Section 6. This is used to get quantitative bounds on the
tendency of the collision operator to keep the density nearly Maxwellian. What we obtain
directly is L1 control on the diﬀerence between f and Mf , but the smoothness bounds
together with the interpolation bounds allows us to obtain control in stronger norms.
Section 7 contains the proofs of the Theorems 2.1 and 2.2, which, given the lemmas, are
quite short. Section 8 is devoted to the proof of existence of stationary solutions, In section
9 we discuss the tendancy toward these stationary solutions.

3. Moment Bounds

In this section we establish a–priori moment bounds for solutions of (2.1). In estimat-
ing the evolution of the moments, we shall use one set of methods to treat the eﬀects of
collisions, and another set to treat everything else. Thus it is natural to rewrite (2.1) as

∂
∂t

1
ǫ

f (v, t) = Lf (v, t) +

Q(F )(v, t)

(3.1)

where Lf = −E · ∇f + Lf .

We shall use the standard “bracket notation” notation for averages: hφit denotes

IR3 φ(v)f (v, t)d3v for any positive or integrable function φ.
Throughout this paper, K will denote a computable constant that depends at most
R
on the electric ﬁeld E, the paramters a, b, c and ν speciﬁed in (2.4), and where indicated,
also on the fourth moment of the initial distribution: h|v|4i0. The constant will, however,
change from line to line.

In these terms, the main result of this section is:

Theorem 3.1 Let f denote a solution to (2.1). Then for Q = QB or Q = QBGK , we have

h|v|4it ≤ h|v|4i0 + K .

Note that by Jensen’s inequality, this imediately controls all lower order moments as

well. The ﬁrst step, however, is to directly conrol the second moments.

Lemma 3.2 Let f denote a solution to (2.1). Then for both choices of the collision kernel
Q, we have

h|v|2it ≤ h|v|2i0 + K

(3.2)

h|v|2it ≤ −ch|v|2it + K .

(3.5)

Then (3.2) in turn follows from the fact that any solution of the diﬀerential inequality
˙x(t) ≤ −cx(t) + K satisﬁes x(t) ≤ x(0) + K/c.

We next parley these bounds into bounds on the fourth moments; i.e., h|v|4it. Since
h|v|4it is not a collision invariant, these depend on the particular collision kernel under
consideration.

from which the result follows.

4. Interpolation inequalities

The lemmas in this section are several interpolation inequalities related to the familiar
Gagliardo–Nirenberg inequalites, but with some special features adapted to our applica-
tions. The inequality of Lemma 4.2 is the most novel and interesting of these.

Lemma 4.1 Let f ∈ L1(IR3). Then there is a universal constant C such that if f has a
square integrable distributional Laplacean, then f has a square integrable gradient, and

Similarly, there is a universal constant C such that if ∆2f is square integrable, then ∆f
is also square integrable, and

where the computable constant C changes from line to line. Optimizing over R now yields
(4.1). The proof of (4.2) is done in the same way.

The next inequality is similar in eﬀect to an “uncertainty principle”. We shall use it

to obtain uniform lower bounds on the variance of our density f .

Lemma 4.2 Let f ∈ L1(IR3), and suppose that f has a square integrable distributional
gradient. Then there is a universal constant C such that

without loss of generality that f is spherically symmetric and radialy decreasing. Now ﬁx
R > 0, and deﬁne g(v) := f (v) for |v| ≤ R, and g(v) = 0 otherwise. Deﬁne h by f = g + h.

5. Smoothness bounds

The purpose of this section is to establish a–priori smoothness bounds for solutions

of (2.1). The main result is the the following:
Theorem 5.1 Let f be a solution of (2.1) such that k∇f (·, 0)k2 is ﬁnite. Then, if Q =
QBGK , there is a constant K such that

k∇f (·, t)k2 ≤ K

1 + k∇f (·, 0)k2

(cid:0)
for all t > 0. Similarly, suppose that k∆f (·, 0)k2 is ﬁnite. Then there is a constant K such
that

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

If Q = QB the same results hold provided kf (·, 0)−Mf (·,0)k1 and ǫ are both suﬃciently

for all t > 0.

small.

Remark: The smallness condition on kf (·, 0) − Mf (·,0)k1 poses no problem here since
we are avoiding an initial layer by assuming that f (·, 0) = Mf (·,0). However, it seems likely
that it would be strightforward to include an inital layer analysis, and to dispense with this
condition – even the present proof does not require kf (·, 0) − Mf (·,0)k1 to be particularly
small.
Proof: Once again, we write (2.1) in the form (3.1). Then diﬀerentiating, and integrating
by parts, we have

since the largest power if x(t) has a negative coeﬃcient.

To conclude the proof of (5.1), we need smoothness bounds for the collision kernel; in
particular, we need an estimate on the smoothness of the gain term in the collision kernel.

For the BGK case, this is given by the following:

Lemma 5.3: For any positive integer n there is a constant K depending only on the second
moment of f , such that

(−∆)nf (v, t)Q(f )(v, t)d3v ≤ K − k(−∆)n/2f k2

ZIR3

(∆Mf )f d3v ≤ CT −1

f k∇f k2 ≤ Ck∇f k9/5

2 ≤ K + k∇f k2
2.

Combining this with (5.4) we get the Lemma 5.3 for n = 1

The analog of Lemma 5.3 for QB is slightly more complicated.

Lemma 5.4: For any positive integer n there are constants K and δ depending only on
the a-priori bound on the second moments of f , such that

(−∆)nf (v, t)QB(f )(v, t)d3v ≤ K − (ℓ/2)k(−∆)n/2f k2

(5.6)

whenever

kf (·, t) − Mf (·,t)(·)k1 ≤ δ .

2
(cid:0)

2 ≤

What we need now is control over k(−∆)n/2f ◦ f k2. This is provided by an inequality from
[13], where it is shown that for any γ > 0 there are constant K and δ > 0 such that

k(−∆)n/2f ◦ f k2

2 ≤ K + γk(−∆)n/2f k2
2.

(5.7)

whenver

kf − Mf k1 ≤ δ .

This inequality is proved in [13] assuming that f has zero mean and unit variance,
and under these conditions, the constants K and δ are universal. Scaling the inequality, we
have it holding with constants K and δ depending only on the second moments of f . (The
inequality is applied in [13] to get stong exponential convergence estimates for the spatially
homogeneous Boltlzmann equation with physically realistic constants in the bounds.)

With this inequality, we need only take γ = 1/2.

Proof of Theorem 5.1: We begin with the proof of (5.1).

To put all of the lemmas together, let τ := (1/ǫ)t as before, and put x(τ ) := kf (·, τ )k2
2.

Combining Lemmas 5.2 and 5.3, we get in the BGK case that

˙x(τ ) ≤ ǫK + K − x(τ )

and any solution of this diﬀerential inequality satisﬁes x(τ ) ≤ x(0) + (1 + ǫ)K for all τ .
This establishes (5.1) in the BGK case. The proof of (5.2) in the BGK case is entirely
analogous.

To handle the Maxwellian collision kernel case, ﬁrst deﬁne

¯t = inf{t such that γkf (·, t) − Mf (·,t)k2

1 ≥ δ/2}

(5.8)

where δ is the universal constant from Lemma 5.4. We take our initial condition small
enough that ¯t > 0. Then, for all t ≤ ¯t, we have the following diﬀerential ineqaulity by
combining Lemmas 5.2 and 5.4:

˙x(τ ) ≤ ǫK + K − ℓx(τ )

16

and any solution of this diﬀerential inequality satisﬁes x(τ ) ≤ x(0) + (1 + ǫ)K/ℓ for all
τ ≤ (1/ǫ)¯t.

It only remains to show that actually ¯t = +∞. We shall do this in the next section
using an entropy inequality. The entropy inequlity requires the a-priori smoothness bounds
from Theorem 5.1, and shows that a long as they hold; i.e., as long as t ≤ ¯t, we have an
upper bound of the form

kf (·, t) − Mf (·,t)k1 ≤ δentropy(ǫ) .

All we have to do now is to take ǫ so small that

δentropy(ǫ) ≤ δ/4

and then it is clear from the deﬁnition of ¯t that ¯t = ∞. Thus, borrowing the entropy
bound from the next section, (5.1) is established for QB for all ǫ suﬃciently small, and all
initial data suﬃcently close to a Maxwellian. Again, (5.2) for QB is handled in an entirely
analogous way.

6. Entropy bounds

Let h(ρ1|ρ2) denote the relative entropy of two probability densities ρ1 and ρ2 on IR3:

h(ρ1|ρ2) =

ρ1
ρ2 (cid:19)

ρ1
ρ2 (cid:19)

ln

(cid:18)

ρ1(cid:18)

d3v .

ZIR3

Here we are primarily interested in bounds on h(f |Mf ). It will be convenient however,
to ﬁrst obtain bounds on h(f |M ), and to then relate the two relative entropies. We do
this in the next two lemmas.

Lemma 6.1 Let f be any solution of (2.1) with

h|v|4i0 ≤ C

and

k∇f k2 < C

for all t ≥ 0. Then there is a constant K depending only on C such that

h(f (·, t)|M ) ≤ K +

f (·, t)Q(·, t))d3v .

Using Jensen’s inequality to bound |hvit| in terms of the uniformly bounded h|v|2it, we

Lemma 6.2 Let f be any solution of (2.1) with

h|v|4i0 ≤ C

and

k∇f k2 < C

for all t ≤ T , some T > 0. Then there is a constant K depending only on C so that such

The lemmas of Section 3 provide uniform bounds on this last term. and therefore provide
uniform bounds on the derivative of h(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t))−h(f (·, t)|M ). The result now follows
from the previous Lemma.

Lemma 6.3 Let Q = QBGK . For any density f with ﬁnite second moments,

ln f Q(f ) ≤ −h(f |Mf )

ZIR3

(6.3)

Proof: Let S(f ) = −
any τ ∈ [0, 1], put f (τ ) = (1 − τ )f + τ Mf . We have

However, the entropy functional is concave, so that

Since Mf and f share the same hydrodynamic moments, S(Mf ) − S(f ) = h(f |Mf )

Lemma 6.4 Let Q = QBGK and f be any solution of (2.1) with

h|v|4i0 ≤ C

and

k∇f k2 < C

for all t Then there is a constant K depending only on C so that

d

h(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t)) ≤ K −

h(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t)) .

(6.4)

ǫ

19

Proof: This follows immediately upon combining the last three lemmas.

In the case of the Boltzmann collision kernel, Lemma 6.3 is replaced by the following

proposition proved in [11]:

Proposition 6.5 For all C > 0, there is a positive function ΦC(r) strictly increasing in
r, such that for all densities f with

|v|4f (v)d3v ≤ C

and

k∇f k2 ≤ C

ZIR3

ln f QB(f ) ≤ −ΦC [h(f |Mf )].

ZIR3

(6.5)

Consequently, for Q = QB, (6.4) is replaced by

d
dt

1
ǫ

h(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t)) ≤ K −

ΦC[h(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t))] .

(6.6)

Now if f (·, 0) = Mf (·,0), so that h(f (·, 0)|Mf (·,0) = 0, then it is evident from this

diﬀerential inequality that

for all t ≥ 0. This together with Kullback’s inequality

ΦC[h(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t))] ≤ ǫK

kf (·, t) − Mf (·,t)k2

1 ≤ 2h(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t))

(6.7)

clearly implies that there is a function δentropy(ǫ), decreasing to zero with ǫ so that

kf (·, t) − Mf (·,t)k1 ≤ δentropy(ǫ)

for all t ≤ ¯t –the times for which we know that f (·, t) will satisfy the bounds in the
hypothesis of Proposition 6.5. But as explained at the end of the proof of Theorem 5.1,
this is enough to show that ¯t = ∞ for all suﬃciently small ǫ. Thus, the entropy bound
provides the information needed to complete the proof of Theorem 5.1 as claimed, and
moreover, (5.8) hold globaly in time.

7. Proof of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2

Proof of Theorem 2.1 Let us consider ﬁrst the case Q = QBGK . Since Maxwellian
initial data satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 6.4, we have that (6.4) holds for the solution
f (·, t) of (2.1) under consideration in Theorem 2.1. But then

et/ǫh(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t))

≤ Ket/ǫ .

d
dt

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

20

Since by hypothesis, h(f (·, 0)|Mf (·,0)) = 0, we have

h(f (·, t)|Mf (·,t)) ≤ ǫK

for all t ≥ 0. This together with Kullback’s inequality (6.7) yields the ﬁrst inequality
asserted in Theorem 2.1, with δ1(ǫ) = ǫ1/2.

To obtain the second, note that since f (·, 0) is Maxwellian, there is a bound on k∆f k2
depending only on h|v|2i0. Inequality (5.2) of Lemma 5.1 now ﬁves us a uniform bound
on k∆f (·, t)k2. Combining this with the interpolation inequality (4.1) ﬁnally yields the
second inequality of Theroem 2.1 with δ2(ǫ) = ǫ1/7 for Q = QBGK .

The proof for Q = QB is only slightly more involved, but in fact we have already given
the proof of the ﬁrst part of Theorem 2.1 in our “back and forth” proof of the smoothness
bounds and entropy bounds for this case. As observed at the end of Section 6,

kf (·, t) − Mf (·,t)k1 ≤ δentropy(ǫ)

for all t ≥ 0, and δentropy(ǫ) does decrease to 0 with ǫ as required. The second part follows
in an entriely similar way.

Proof of Theorem 2.2 This will follow from Theorem 2.1, and it is now no longer
necessary to separate the cases Q = QBGK and Q = QB.
As we have computed in the proof of Lemma 3.1,

h|v|2it =

d
dt
− 2E · hvit + 6hDit + 2(v · ∇D)h(v · ∇D)it − 2hD|v|2it

If we replace the density f (·, t) everywhere on the right by Mf (·,t), by deﬁnition we obtain
the function G(u(t), e(t)) where u(t) and e(t) are the moments of f (·, t) ﬁguring in Theorem
2.2. The error we make has to be estimated term by term. The least trivial of these terms
concerns the contribution from hD|v|2it, and is estimated as follows:

|hD|v|2it −

D(v)|v|2Mf (·,t)(v)d3v| ≤

ZIR3

D(v)|v|2|f (v, t) − Mf (·,t)(v)|d3v ≤

ZIR3

Theorem 2.1 yields a bound of the size δ1(ǫ)1/2. The other error terms in the time deriva-
tives of h|v|2it and hvit are bounded by a direct application of Theorem 2.1 (and hence
yield errors of order δ1(ǫ) instead of δ1(ǫ)1/2).

8. Stationary solutions

In this section we discuss stationary solutions of (2.1), and prove Theorem 2.4. The

stationary solutions of (2.1) are the positive normalized solutions of

ǫLf + Q(f ) = 0.

(8.1)

The existence of such solutions relies on a simple ﬁxed point argument. Recalling the
expression of Q(f ), we put

J(f ) =

Mf
f ◦ f

(cid:26)

in the BGK case ,

in the Boltzmann case .

Equation (8.1) can be rewritten as

f = J(f ) +

Lf,

ǫ
ℓ

G = (1 −

L)−1,

ǫ
ℓ

where ℓ = 1 in the BGK case. The explicit form of the linear operator L implies that, for
ǫ suﬃciently small, the operator

is positivity and normalization preserving on L1(IR3). (That is, it is a Markovian operator).
Moreover, it is clear from the smoothing properties of of G that it is compact on L1(IR3).
Also, J is a positivity and normalization preserving map of L1(IR3) into itself. Then since
we can rewrite (8.2) as

f = GJ(f ).

we see that the solutions of (8.1) that we seek are the ﬁxed points of the map f 7→ GJ(f ).
The properties of this map listed above prove the existence of ﬁxed points (see [14]). Let
us denote by f∗ one of them. It is then easy to check that it solves (8.1) pointwise.

Next we note that the same arguments used in previous sections imply that, if f

solves(8.1) then

kf∗ − Mf∗k ≤ δentropy(ǫ).

(8.4)

This concludes the ﬁrst part of Theorem 2.4.

Everything done so far would apply in the Boltzmann case as well as the BGK case.
What we don’t know at this point is: Are there ﬁxed points in each of the stable neigh-
borhoods, and if so is there exactly one in each stable neighborhood.

These questions can be positively answered in the BGK case in a simplre way.
It
seems likely that one could also provide a positive answer for at least the ﬁrst of them for
the Boltzmann kernel, but we have not done more than skecth a lengthly argument, and
so will conﬁne ourselve to the BGK case.

In fact, since G = I + ǫLG with I the identity map and J(f ) = Mf , we can write (8.4)

as

Note that the right hand side of (8.5) depends only on u and e, the ﬁrst and second
moments of f . If we multiply (8.5) by v or by v2 and integrate, we get

f = Mǫ + ǫLGMǫ.

Fǫ(u, e) = 0,
Gǫ(u, e) = 0,

(8.5)

(8.6)

because f and Mf have the same ﬁrst two moments. The functions Fe and Ge are quite
complicated, but for ǫ = 0 they reduce to the functions F and G in the right hand side of
(2.14). Then, by Proposition 2.3 we know there are solutions (u∗, e∗) to (8.6) for ǫ = 0.
Moreover the diﬀerential of the map (u, e) → (Fǫ(u, e), G(u, e)) has eigenvalues with non
vanishing real part, in ǫ = 0 and (u, e) = (u∗, e∗), when E is in the appropriate range.
Therefore, by the implicit function theorem, for ǫ suﬃciently small, we have a unique
solution (uǫ, eǫ) in a neighborough of (u∗, e∗) to (8.6). Let Mǫ be the Maxwellian with
moments (uǫ, eǫ). Then it is easy to check that

f = Mǫ + LGMǫ

is solution to (8.1). This concludes Theorem 2.4.

9. Long time behavior.

It is natural to ask whether the stationary solution are the asymptotic limits as t →
+∞ of the evolution starting in appropriate neighborhoods of the ﬁxed point Maxwellian.
To this we have only a partial answer even in the BGK case:

Proposition 9.1 Choose a stable ﬁxed point (u∗, e∗) of (2.14) and let f∗ be a station-
ary solution of (2.1) in the neighborhood of M(u∗,e∗). Assume that the solution ft of the
time dependent problem starting near M(u∗,e∗) has moments u(t) and e(t) converging to
u∗ and e∗ respectively. Then

lim
t→+∞

||f − f∗||2 = 0.

Unfortunately we do not have enough control on the time behavior of the solution
to check the convergence of the moments. We expect however such convergence and this

23

can be proven for a modiﬁed model where we consider, instead of a diﬀusion coeﬃcient
D depending on the velocity, one depending only on the average e. A straightforward
calculation then shows that one gets closed equations for the ﬁrst two moments and the
long time asymptotics is easily obtained. In this case all our results still apply and the
conditions of Proposition 2.5 are fulﬁlled.

First we prove Proposition 2.5. Let f∗ be a ﬁxed point and f the distribution at time

t. Calculating as in previous sections, we have:

This implies x(t) → 0 as t → ∞, provided that a(t) → 0 as t → ∞. This concludes
Proposition 2.5.

The convergence of Mf to Mf∗ is not easy to get for (2.1). A simple answer is obtained

if one replaces the operator L1 given by (2.3) with

L1f (v) = D(e)∇ ·

This model is much simpler than the one already considered, but still has a non trivial
behavior on the hydrodynamical sale. In particular, it is easy to see that, if we write the
equations for u and e, we get a closed system in those variables. Namely, (2.14),(2.15) and
(2.16) are replaced by

the functions F and G being given explicitly by

d

G(u, e) = Eu + 3D(e) − 2eD(e).

(9.4)

Equation (9.2) is exact for this model independently of ǫ and for suitable choices of the
functions D(e) has several critical points for E in an appropriate range. Moreover the
asymptotic behavior for large times is easy to establish. All our results apply to this
model without substantial changes. In particular, in this case we can use Proposition 2.5
to obtain the convergence to stationary solutions for large times.

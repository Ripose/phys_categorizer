Abstract

Subcritical transition of an inhomogeneous plasma where turbulences with diﬀerent characteristic

space-time scales coexist is analyzed with methods of statistical physics of turbulences. We derived

the development equations of the probability density function (PDF) of the spectrum amplitudes

of the ﬂuctuating electro-static potential. By numerically solving the equations, the steady state

PDFs were obtained. Although the subcritical transition is observed when the turbulent ﬂuctua-

tions are ignored, the PDF shows that the transition is smeared out by the turbulent ﬂuctuations.

It means that the approximation ignoring the turbulent ﬂuctuations employed by traditional tran-

sition theories could overestimate the range where hysteresis is observed and statistical analyses

are inevitably needed.

INTRODUCTION

Transition phenomena with sudden changes of states are observed in turbulent plasmas.

Since these transition phenomena like the L-H transition play crucial roles for magnetic

conﬁnement of fusion plasmas, the transition associated with formation of transport barriers

is one of the main subjects of high-temperature plasma physics.

Traditional theories for transition of high-temperature plasmas are formulated in terms

of averaged physical quantities [1, 2]. Fluctuations around the averages are ignored and

transition phenomena are described deterministically.

However, high-temperature plasmas are strongly non-linear systems with huge number

of degrees of freedom and hence their behavior should be chaotic and unpredictable in a

deterministic way. In fact, broad distribution of critical values of parameters where transi-

tions occur and intermittent transport called “avalanche phenomena” are observed in recent

experiments [3, 4, 5]. Occurrence of these behaviors, which cannot be described only by

averaged quantities, are considered due to strong turbulent ﬂuctuations. It is inevitable to

describe turbulent plasmas in terms of probability or ensembles like numerical forecast of

weather, since the magnitudes of ﬂuctuations around averages are of the same order as that

of the averages in turbulent states.

Therefore, transition takes place as a statistical process in the presence of stochastic noise

sources induced by turbulence interactions. As a generic feature, transition is expected to

occur with a ﬁnite probability when a control parameter approaches the critical value.

Statistical theories for plasma turbulence have been developed and the framework to

calculate the probability density function (PDF), the transition probability etc. has been

made [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In the statistical theories, the time-development of the system

is described by a set of diﬀerential equations with random forces, called the “Langevin

equations”. All the information on the statistical properties of the system is obtained by

solving the Langevin equation.

The framework has been applied to cases where only one turbulent mode is excited and

the turbulence is characterized by one space-time scale [6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15].

However, it is well known that there are many kinds of turbulent ﬂuctuations in high-

temperature plasmas and that diﬀerent characteristic length scales coexist. The importance

of interactions between modes with diﬀerent scale lengths has recently been recognized. For

2

instance, the dynamics of the meso-scale structure of the radial electric ﬁeld [16, 17, 18] is

known to cause variation in the dynamics of microscopic ﬂuctuations like in the electric ﬁled

domain interface [19, 20], zonal ﬂow [21] and streamer [22]. Coexistence of multiple scale

turbulence has also been investigated by use of the direct numerical simulations [23, 24].

Statistical theory on zonal ﬂow dynamics [25] and that of the L-H transition theory has been

developed [13].

In the present paper, we apply the statistical theoretic algorithm to a model of high-

temperature plasma where two characteristic scales coexist. One is the current diﬀusive

interchange mode (CDIM) micro turbulence [17], whose characteristic length scale is of the

order of the collisionless skin depth δ = c/ωp. The other is the ion-temperature gradient

(ITG) mode turbulence, whose characteristic wave length is of the order of the ion gyroradius

ρi, as an example of the drift wave ﬂuctuations considered to dictate a considerable part

of the turbulent transport [26]. Hereafter, we call these two modes “the high wave number

mode” and “the low wave number mode” respectively for its simplicity. We assume that the
condition ρi ≫
and hence the coexistence of the high wave number mode and the low wave number mode

δ holds. Both turbulences are considered to cause the anomalous transport

turbulences and their interplay should be taken into account.

It is known that the subcritical transition occurs in this system, when the pressure-

gradient and the radial electric ﬁeld are changed [27]. However, the turbulent ﬂuctuations

are ignored in the analysis. In the present paper, with the statistical theory, we analyze

the eﬀect of the turbulent ﬂuctuations on stochastic properties of the transition and show

that the ﬂuctuation changes the phase structure of the system completely. More precisely,

we show that the transition is smeared out by noises, i.e., the physical quantities changes

gradually without clear transition.

The present paper is organized as follows; the statistical theory and the model are formu-

lated in Sec. II. The results of deterministic analyses including occurrence of the subcritical

bifurcation are summarized in Sec. III. The Section IV, i.e., the main part of this paper,

presents the statistical properties of the system. Summary and discussions are given in Sec.

V.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND THE MODEL

In this section, we brieﬂy review the theoretical framework and the model of turbulent

plasmas where two diﬀerent characteristic scales coexist [27].

The starting point of the theory is the reduced MHD for the three ﬁelds: the electro-static

potential, the current and the pressure. The Langevin equation that the statistical theory is

based upon is derived as one of model equations which reproduce the two-time correlation

functions and the response functions obtained by the renormalization perturbation theory

(the direct-interaction approximation) for the reduced MHD [9].

The Langevin equation describes time-development of two variables characterizing the

system. One is the spectrum amplitude of the electro-static potential for the characteristic
wave number kh of the high wave number mode, xh ≡
φ∗
l , whose characteristic wave number is kl.

mode and the low wave number mode respectively when there is no interactions between

two modes. The characteristic time constants for the two modes are deﬁned as

In these equations, the nonlinear terms of the reduced MHD are divided into two parts:

One part is coherent with the test ﬁeld and is renormalized into the deterministic terms,

i.e., the second terms. The other is incoherent and is modeled by random forces wh, wl.

Another random force wt denotes the thermal noise and the magnitude of the noise, ǫ, is a

small quantity compared to the magnitudes of other noises. Technically, introduction of ǫ is

needed in order to exclude singularity at xh = 0 of the PDF.

Since wh, wl and wt are forces which ﬂuctuates randomly in time, the Langevin equation

describes the stochastic time-development of the turbulent ﬂuctuation of the system. For

4

simplicity, we assume that the random forces are Gaussian and white;

This system is sustained by the space inhomogeneities, the curvature of the magnetic ﬁeld

interactions between the low and high wave number modes. The pressure gradient controls

the growth rate of the low wave number mode and Ω′dP0/dx excites both the high and

low wave number mode turbulences. The gradient of the radial electric ﬁeld suppresses

turbulences [16, 17, 18].

We assume that the relation ρi ≫
the two modes are widely separated as

δ holds and hence the characteristic length-scales for

kh ≫
The mutual interactions between the low and high wave number modes are asymmetric,

since the spatial structure of the low wave number mode is a large-scale inhomogeneity for

the high wave number mode. The assertion Eq. (5) also means that the time-scales are

widely separated since the time scales are given by Eq. (1);

ωh ≫

ωl.

(6)

By analyzing the Langevin equation, Eqs. (2, 3), a number of statistical properties of

turbulent plasmas can be derived. For example, the analytical formulae of the rate of change

of states of plasmas, the transition rates, were derived. Furthermore, since the renormalized

transport coeﬃcients and the random forces have the same origin, i.e., nonlinear interactions

in MHD turbulence, relations between the ﬂuctuation levels of turbulence and the transport

coeﬃcients like the viscosity and the diﬀusivity were derived.

III. BIFURCATION WITHOUT RANDOM FORCES

With the theoretical framework brieﬂy described in the previous section, we analyze the

model of the inhomogeneous plasma with two characteristic scales.

At ﬁrst, we show the steady state solutions when random forces are ignored, in order to

compare to the results with the random forces obtained later. The steady state solutions

are obtained by solving the set of nonlinear equations when the random forces are turned

Figure 1 shows the r-dependence when p = 30. When r

0.49 . . ., the low wave number

mode turbulence is suppressed. As r is increased, the system experiences the subcritical

transition to the state where the low wave number mode turbulence is excited. When

0.49 . . . < r < 1, there are two stable solutions and it means that the system is bi-stable.

From the deterministic point of view, the transition is expected to occur only at the ridge

point and the bifurcation point. The qualitative behavior does not depend on the value of

p as far as p > 1.9 . . ..

The phase diagram is shown in Fig. 2. The subcritical bifurcation is observed when the

value of the parameter p is larger than 1.9 . . .. On the other hand, when p

IV. THE STOCHASTIC PROPERTIES

In the rest of the present paper, we analyze the stochastic properties of the model, Eqs.

(2, 3), to investigate the eﬀect of the turbulent ﬂuctuations, i.e., the random forces.

A. The adiabatic approximation and the Fokker-Planck equation

At ﬁrst, we approximate the Langevin equation Eqs. (2, 3) with making use of the time

scale separation between the low and high wave number mode turbulences.

The scale separation, Eq. (6), means that the high wave number mode xh quickly relaxes

to the steady state determined by the value of the low wave number mode variable xl which

is ﬁxed at the value xl = xl(t) at the time.

We analyze the steady state of the high wave number mode xh when xl is ﬁxed. A state

of a stochastic system is described by the probability that a state variable takes a certain

value. The time-development of the probability density function (PDF) P (xh, t) of xh is

determined by Kramers-Moyal expansion applied to the Langevin equation of xh, Eq. (3).

The steady state solution of Eq. (11) when xl is ﬁxed is shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that

the peak of the PDF is relatively narrow and it means that the high wave number mode

turbulence spends most of time at the peak value x∗

h. Hence, we can say that it is good

approximation to replace xh in the Langevin equation of the low wave number mode with
the peak value x∗
h.

The equation to determine the location of the peak x∗

It is important to note that Eq. (12) is essentially diﬀerent from Eq. (8) in existence of the

second term of Eq. (12), which comes from the random force x

3/2
h wh of Eq. (3). It implies

that the random forces change the steady state of the high wave number mode.

Consequently, the adiabatically approximated Langevin equation for the low wave number

mode is given by Eq. (2) where xh is replaced with x∗

B. The probability density functions and the eﬀect of the random forces

In this subsection, we investigate properties of the steady state PDF of the low wave

number mode, P (xl), by numerically solving Eq. (14). Although we will show ﬁgures when

the parameter p is ﬁxed at p = 30, qualitative behavior is the same as that for other p values

larger than 1.9 . . ..

At ﬁrst, we show in Fig. 4 the steady state PDF in the small r region. In this region,

we have seen that the low wave number mode is suppressed when the turbulent ﬂuctuations

are ignored. Figure 4 shows that the probability that the low wave number mode is quiet is

large and hence the analysis ignoring random forces is a good approximation in this region.

However, as the value of the parameter r is increased, the characteristics change com-

the low wave number mode is suppressed is large and the result is compatible with that of the

deterministic analyses given in Fig. 1.

pletely. The steady state PDF when r > 0.49 . . . is shown in Fig. 5.

In the region

0.49 . . . < r < 1, we have seen that the subcritical transition occurs and the system is

bi-stable if the random forces are ignored. Although there are two peaks in the PDF which

are compatible with the previous result without random forces, the valley between the peaks

is too shallow to identify the two states. In other words, even if one observes the time-series

of xl(t), the value of xl(t) strolls around the two peaks without a sudden change. It means

that the bi-stability of the system, i.e., the subcritical transition, is smeared out by the

turbulent ﬂuctuations.

The steady state PDF for r > 1 is also shown in Fig. 5. It is seen that the PDF has

a single peak. The single peak is compatible with the result of the deterministic analysis,

where only one state exists. However, the peak is wide and hence xl ﬂuctuates widely around

the location of the peak. The variance of the ﬂuctuation is as large as the peak value and it

means that the ﬂuctuation cannot be ignored. Furthermore, the peak value 0.29 . . . obtained
when r = 1.5, p = 30 is diﬀerent from the root of Eqs. (7, 8), which is given as xl ≃

0.98.

In order to see these consequences explicitly, in Fig. 6, we show the comparison of the

contour plot of the PDF and the bifurcation diagram obtained by the analysis ignoring the

random forces. It is seen that the location of the region which has large probability and

parameter r is changed. Furthermore, the location of the peak of the PDF is far from the

result when the random forces are ignored when r

0.49 . . ..

≥

Next, in order to investigate the meaning of the average in such a turbulent system, we

analyze the tail of the steady state PDF P (xl) shown in Fig. 7. It is shown that the tail

of the PDF is well-approximated by the power-law and hence the probability is distributed

broadly over large values of the ﬂuctuation. The exponent is about

0.34 for the case shown

−

in Fig. 7. It means that the average, i.e., “the center of mass” of the PDF, is shifted in the

large xl direction with the long tail and hence the average is not equal to the value that xl

takes with large probability. The values that xl takes with large probability are characterized

by the peaks of the PDF and are called the most probable values. The diﬀerence between

the average and the most probable value is shown in Fig. 8.

Furthermore, hysteresis cannot be captured by observing the average, since the quantity

is single-valued from its deﬁnition. On the other hand, the most probable values depict the

hysteresis as shown in Fig. 9. Although relatively steep variation of the average is observed,

the hysteresis can be seen only for the most probable values.

well-separated in those space-time scales coexist; the “high wave number mode” turbulence

(the CDIM micro turbulence) and the “low wave number mode” turbulence (the ITG mode

semi-micro turbulence). We derived the development equations of the PDFs of the spectrum

amplitudes of the electro-static potential for the characteristic wave numbers. By numeri-

cally solving the adiabatically approximated Fokker-Planck equation, the steady state PDFs

for the low wave number mode turbulence were obtained. Although the subcritical bifurca-

tion is observed when the turbulent ﬂuctuations are ignored, the shape of the PDF shows

that the transition is smeared out by the ﬂuctuations.

It means that the approximation

ignoring the turbulent ﬂuctuation like the traditional transition theories could overestimate

the range of cusp catastrophe.

We also compared the average values with the most probable values and showed that

these two characteristic values of stochastic nature are diﬀerent due to the long power-law

tail of the PDF. It means that the average does not mean the value which is expected to

realize most probably and hence description of the state of the turbulent systems needs not

only the average but also other statistical quantities like the most probable values and the

variances.

Consequently,

these our results warn that the deterministic description of high-

temperature plasmas cannot capture important information of the turbulent systems and

the statistical analyses with the Langevin equations and the PDFs are inevitably needed.

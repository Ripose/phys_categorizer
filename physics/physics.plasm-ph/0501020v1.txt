Abstract

We derive the diﬀerential equation governing the stationary states
generated by relaxation of turbulent two-dimensional plasma or plane-
tary atmosphere. The dynamics (described by the Charney-Hasegawa-
Mima equation) corresponds to drift waves in plasma and Rossby
waves in planetary atmosphere. A ﬁeld-theoretical formalism is devel-
oped for the continuum version of the equivalent model, the system
of discrete, point-like vortices in plane. It is found that the stationary
states are obtained at self-duality.

1 Introduction

The instabilities of a plasma embedded in a conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. ex-
perimental fusion devices, like tokamak) evolve in a geometry that is strongly
anisotropic. The motion of the electrons along the magnetic ﬁeld lines is in
many cases suﬃciently fast to produce a density perturbation that has the
Boltzmann distribution in the electric potential. In these cases a two dimen-
sional approximation (the dynamical equations are written in the plane that
is transversal to the magnetic ﬁeld) may be satisfactory. The linearized Boltz-
mann electron distribution suppresses the convective nonlinearity, leaving the
ion polarization drift as the essential nonlinearity. This is of high diﬀerential
degree (therefore it is enhanced at small spatial scales) and basically de-
scribes the advection of the ﬂuctuating vorticity by the velocity ﬂuctuations.
The diﬀerential equation for the electrostatic potential has been derived by
Hasegawa and Mima [1]. A similar situation appears in the physics of the at-
mosphere and the diﬀerential equation for the streamfunction of the velocity
ﬁeld has been derived by Charney [2].

Many plasma instabilities (in particular in tokamak) depend on this non-
linear term and will likely show some common aspects. In numerical simu-
lations of the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) equation it has been proved
that the plasma is evolving at large times (in the absence of external driving
forces and starting from an irregular ﬂow pattern) to states that are char-
acterised by a regular form of the potential. The evolution toward a very
regular pattern of vortical ﬂow is also characteristic to the incompressible
ideal ﬂuid, described by the Euler equation [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In
this case the time-asymptotic states consists of few vortices, of regular shape,
with very slow motion. The streamfunction obeys, in these states, the sinh-
Poisson equation. In the case of CHM equation, the cuasi-stationary states
also consist of structures but it has not been possible to derive an equation
for the streamfunction [10]. There are seveal studies of the CHM (or very
similar) equations showing that at large time the ﬂow is strongly organized
and dominated by structures [11], [12], [13], [14] (and references therein). At
the oposite limit the turbulent regime can be treated with renormalization
group methods [15].

The formulation of the problem exclusively in terms of experimentally-
accessible quantities, velocity and vorticity seems to not allow too much free-
dom in elaborating a theoretical model from which the stationary states to be
determined. In all our considerations we will be guided by the analogous ex-
perience in the case of the Euler ﬂuid. In that case the existence of a parallel
formulation (although the mathematical equivalence is still not fully proven)
has been decissive. That model consists of the discrete set of point-like vor-

3

tices evolving in plane due to a potential given as the natural logarithm of the
relative distance. Comparing with the diﬀerential equation of the Euler ﬂuid
this alternative formulation provides something fundamentally new: it splits
the dynamics into two objects of distinct nature: point-like vortices and po-
tential, or, in other words, matter and ﬁeld carrying the interaction. Going
along this model we are led to consider the standard treatment in these cases.
We must assume that each of these objects can evolve freely (i.e. indepen-
dent of the other) and in addition there is an interaction between them. This
formulation is standard in electrodynamics (classical or quantum). Going to
continuum, the discrete set of point-like vortices becomes a ﬁeld of “matter”
(which must be assumed in general complex), the potential will be a free ﬁeld
(called “gauge”, similar with the free electromagnetic ﬁeld) and, in addition,
there is the interaction between the matter and the gauge ﬁelds (similar to
the classical jµAµ charge-ﬁeld interaction). Basic properties of the original,
physical, model impose constraints to this ﬁeld-theoretical formulation. The
presence of vorticity requires a particular form of the potential between dis-
crete vortices:
it is the curl of a sum of natural logarithms. This can only
be derived from a gauge-ﬁeld Lagrangean density of Chern-Simons type, in-
stead of Maxwell type. Therefore the ﬁeld-theoretical model will contain the
Chern-Simons Lagrangean. The matter ﬁeld has a nonlinear self-interaction
that reﬂects the stationary structure of the free matter ﬁeld. The coupling
of the two ﬁelds (the interaction) is minimal, via the covariant derivatives.
In a previous work we have formulated this model and have obtained, in this
way, a purely analytic derivation of the sinh-Poisson equation for the Euler
ﬂuid [16].

This paper will develop a model for the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equa-
tion along the same lines. However several diﬀerences will impose new fea-
tures of the model.

In a previous work [17] we have investigated a model based on the simi-
larity with the superﬂuid ﬁeld theory, the Abelian-Higgs model. This is able
to describe positive ﬂuid vortices. We have also proposed, without details, a
more extended model, which seemed able to describe the physical vortices of
plasma and atmosphere within the regime of the CHM equation.

The full development of this model is the main objective of the present

work.

The similarity between the two equation, Eq.(1) and Eq.(3) is apparent.
However, with regard to the form and properties of the stationary states
of the two equations we should not attempt of simply taking any previous
conclusion derived from the Euler ﬂuid context into the CHM context. This
is because the naive stationarity (∂/∂t = 0) imposed in the two equations
leads to an equation with a vast degree of generality and does not provide,
by itself, a clear identiﬁcation of the ﬁnal vortex shapes. We may represent
the family of all possible solutions of the naive stationary limit as a subset
in a function space. In the time evolution the two equations produces two
series of conﬁgurations representing functions belonging to two distinct paths,
ending in this set at distinct positions.

Compared with the equation for the ideal ﬂuid (Euler equation) the CHM
eq. is not scale invariant [18]. To see this we make the rescaling of the space
variables

(x, y)

(x′, y′) = (λx, λy)

3 An equivalent discrete model

In the case of the Euler ﬂuid, there is an equivalent model whose dynamical
evolution is considered to be identical with that of the physical system (for
a list of references, see [16]). It consists of a collection of discrete point-like
vortices in two-dimensions evolving from mutual interaction deﬁned in terms
of a potential. The potential is the natural logarithm of the relative distance
of two vortices. This model has been proposed and used long ago (Kirchoﬀ,
Onsager, etc.) but the rigurous proof of the equivalence between it and the
physical Euler description is a diﬃcult mathematical problem [19].

For the CHM equation there is a similar model: a collection of point-like
vortices interacting by a potential that has a short range. This model has
been proposed in meteorology by Morikawa [20] and Stewart [21] (see Horton
and Hasegawa [14]). For a set of N vortices with strength ωj, j = 1, N
with instantaneous positions rj the streamfunction ψ (x, y) has the following
expression

the ﬁeld associated with the potential carrying the interaction between

explained. For the Euler equation, the potential can be represented using
the angle made by the line connecting the reference (rj) and the current (r)

into distinct sets characterised by an integer, representing how many times
the circle in the plane is covered by the circle representing the values of θ.

The main diﬀerence between the Euler and the CHM cases is the short
range of the potential in the latter case. If we use formally the concept of
photon (a “particle” that mediates the gauge interaction as in electrodynam-
ics), one can say that in the Euler case we have the usual (two dimensional)
massless photon, whereas in the CHM case we have a massive photon. The
fact that the photon is massive is another way to express the fast spatial de-
cay of the potential function, i.e. the short range and we will often use this
formulation. From physical reasons we know that this short spacial range
must be of the order of ρs, the intrinsic length in the CHM equation. The
need that the equations of motion lead to a short-range potential (ﬁnite-mass
photon) and that the potential has a topological nature represent constraints
for the part of the Lagrangean density coming from the gauge ﬁeld.

As we have shown in the case of Euler ﬂuid [16], the topological nature of

the potential is provided by the Chern-Simons (CS) Lagrangean

LCS =

κ
2

εαβγAα∂βAγ

(20)

where εαβγ is the totally antisymmetric tensor in 2 + 1 dimensions (α, β and
γ can take three values: 0, 1, 2, corresponding to the time and the two coor-
dinates (x, y)) and κ is a constant. This Lagrangean is essentially the density
of “magnetic” helicity. It is known that this Lagrangean does not lead by
itself to dynamical equations for the potential Aµ since it is ﬁrst order in the
time derivatives; it only represents a constraint on the dynamics, analogous
to the Lorentz force in an external magnetic ﬁeld given by the combination
of κ with the other constants of the model. We can heuristically say that the
Chern-Simons Lagrangean induce vortical eﬀects on the dynamics. This will
become more clear later.

The gauge ﬁeld dynamics can be introduced either by coupling the Chern-
Simons potential with the matter ﬁeld, or by including the Maxwell La-
grangean density

1
2
or both. We note that any of these combinations provide a ﬁnite mass for
the photon but the way they do that is diﬀerent.

LM =

FµνF µν

(21)

−

For the combination Maxwell and Chern-Simons, the vortical eﬀect of the
Chern-Simons part induces decay of the ﬁeld on structures of small spatial
scale, with an extension governed by the “external magnetic ﬁeld”, κ. This
corresponds to the gyration motion.

10

For the combination Maxwell and matter ﬁeld the generation of the pho-
ton mass is due to a classical Higgs mechanism. The matter ﬁeld has a
nonlinear self-interaction which vanishes at certain non-zero values of the
ﬁeld. Therefore the extremum of the action implies the minimum of this
self-interaction potential and the matter ﬁeld will take one of these values
(called: the vacuum value) at inﬁnity. This is the symmetry breaking leading
to the Higgs mechanism. The motion of the photon in a polarisable medium
consisting of this background matter density induces a ﬁnite mass eﬀect for
the photon. Then the value of the mass for the photon (the short range of
the spatial decay) is determined by this vacuum value of the matter ﬁeld and
by the coeﬃcient of the Maxwell contribution in the Lagrangean (the electric
charge).

The combination Maxwell, Chern-Simons and matter has therefore two
possible ways to obtain a ﬁnite mass for the photon: the gyration (due to
Chern-Simons) and the Higgs mechanism, due to the ﬁnite background of
matter ﬁeld corresponding to one of its “vacuum” values. There is a mixing
of these two ways and there are two possible masses, or short ranges for the
gauge potential. At the limit where the Maxwell term is suppressed from the
Lagrangean, the short range of Chern-Simons with matter is recovered.

We argue that including the Maxwell term is not necessary in our model
describing the ﬂow governed by the CHM equation. This would only provide
for the gauge ﬁeld an independent dynamical evolution since, even when the
matter ﬁeld is absent, the Maxwell Lagrangean leads to plane waves, i.e. a
propagating ﬁeld, without any meaning or justiﬁcation in our case.

4.2 The matter ﬁeld

The matter ﬁeld φ is associated to (without being identical with) the density
of point-like vortices in the discrete model. The matter ﬁeld must be com-
plex since the vorticity carried by any point-like vortex appears as a sort of
electrical charge (only complex ﬁelds can represent charged particles). The
kinematical part of the matter ﬁeld in the Lagrangean consists as usual in the
squared momentum but with the covariant derivatives, to reﬂect the so-called
minimal coupling with the gauge ﬁeld

where

(23)

In the Hamiltonian formulation of the discrete vortices model for the
Euler equation it has been derived an equation connecting the gauge ﬁeld

11

with the “density” of the point-like vortices. Going to the continuum (i.e.
ﬁeld-theoretical) version it appeared that the only way to keep this constraint
was to assume a self-interaction of the matter ﬁeld. The same reasons act
in our present case, but now the problem is more complicated. The self-
interaction potential V (φ) must have a minimum at a nonzero value of the
matter ﬁeld such as to ensure the background that will induce (together with
the CS term) the short-range of the gauge ﬁeld. Comparing with the Euler
case (we neglect the various constant factors)

where v is the vacuum value of the matter ﬁeld. However, it will be shown
below that this form cannot provide, for the Lagrangean density consisting of
Chern-Simons and matter part, the most symmetrical extremum of the action
functional for the system. This particular state is called self-duality and we
adopt the point of view that this is a fundamental requirement on the model.
In particular in our previous paper [16] it was shown that the stationary
states of the ideal ﬂuid obeying the sinh-Poisson equation correspond to the
self-duality.

In a diﬀerent context [26], [27] the form of the self-interaction potential

able to support self-duality has been found as

4.3 The necessity to consider “pairing” of the ﬁelds

The main physical content of the states governed by the CHM equation is the
vorticity, which is organizing in large scale vortical structures. The vorticity
and the velocity ﬁelds generate the kinematic helicity, which is a topological
invariant for a dissipationless ﬂuid/plasma. It has been shown [29] that the
helicity is determined from the boundary condition (this becomes evident
in the Clebsch representation of the velocity): the values of helicity on the
boundary of the volume are suﬃcient to determine the value at any internal
point. We understand that besides the ﬁelds deﬁned in the internal points,
we need to consider ﬁelds that carry the information from the boundary
toward the interior, on equal foot with ﬁelds that carry informations from

12

the points of the internal volume to the boundary. This pairing of functions
suggests that all quantities involved in our model will be matrices. The model
becomes non-Abelian and the quantities are elements of the algebra of the
group SU (2).

5 The ﬁeld theoretical formalism

The continuum limit of the system of discrete point-like vortices is a ﬁeld
theory. From the discussion of the previous Section, we have the ﬁeld the-
oretical model: covariant, SU (2), Chern-Simons for the gauge ﬁeld and 6th
order self-interaction for the matter ﬁeld.

matic Lagrangean (i.e. covariant derivatives, implementing the mini-

The transformations of the space and time variables must be connected

Taking the gauge condition

it results the equation

The solution of this equation is, in cylindrical geometry,

∂τ ∂τ A0

A0 = 0

A0 (r) = K0 (mr)

7.2 A bound on the energy

We can express the total energy of the system as the space integral of the
time-time component of the energy-momentum tensor

We can take in this integral static solutions.

xK0 (x) dx = [Γ (1)]2

(cf. Gradshtein 8.338). This must be used with Eq.(10) to calculate the total
energy of a system of vortices in plane.

Then we have that the 2D integral over the plane of the continuum version
of the energy of a system with discrete vortices is constant multiplying the

s

35

square of the elementary quantity of vorticity, which was before associated to
each elementary vortex. This corresponds actually to the value of the energy
in the ﬁeld theoretical model, precisely at the self-dual limit, Eq.(56). To see
this in more detail, we start from the energy as integral of the density of the
Hamiltonian Eq.(51). Since all other terms in the expression of the energy
are positive (they vanish after adopting the self-duality and the particular
6th order potential), the energy is bounded from below

In conclusion we can say that the equality of the minimum energy with
the magnetic ﬂux (a bound for the energy) cannot be realised for the same
values that obtain the vanishing of the scalar self-interaction potential.

7.5 Comment on the physical constants and normali-

sations

One of the characteristics of the physical model is the presence of a uni-
form background of vorticity. In the absence of any excitation we have on

47

any contour in plane a tangential projection of the velocity of the particles
performing the Larmor gyration.

An arbitrary contour (say, a large circle of radius R) will intersect the
circle of the Larmor gyration (of radius ρs) and one can calculate an average of
projection of the velocity onto the tangent at the contour line. Supposing that
ρs, the contour intercepted by the Larmor circle can be approximated
R
θ0.
with a stright line that intersects the circle between the angles θ0 and π
The contour is a chord and the average vθ0 of the velocity’s projection on it,
vc (θ), is

The symmetric situation will bring a similar factor and ﬁnally the average

i.e. we obtain that the value of the vorticity in a region with uniform density

We have in this moment three parallel models, representing the same real-
ity, which we call the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima vortical ﬂow. The connection
between these three models implies a comparison of the physical quantities
present in each of them. For this reason we have to consider the physical
content of the ﬁeld-theoretical model and in particular we will introduce
nondimensional variables. The two physical quantities appearing explicitly
in the ﬁeld-theoretical model are κ and v2.

7.6 Properties of the equation related to scaling

Other choices of the constant of integration are possible, instead of Eq.(117).
Let p be an arbitrary constant positive number and introduce a “factorisa-
tion” of the constant v2

The streamfunction is shifted with a constant value, which does not change
neither the velocity nor the vorticity. The results of the normalisation ef-
fected before can be reobtained by choosing p = 1 which implies ω0 = v2/4.
In conclusion, the choice of an arbitrary value for the constant p in Eq.(222)
is equivalent with a rescaling of the space variables and a shift of the stream-
function, with a modiﬁcation of the form of the right hand side of the diﬀer-
ential equation.

7.7 Comparison with numerical simulation and with

experiment

The comment of the previous Subsection was intended to emphasize that
the second factor of the nonlinearity i.e. (cosh ψ′
p) can also be negative,
under a certain choice of normalizations. Then, a certain aspect of the graphs
resulting from numerical simulations (see Seyler [10]), i.e. the presence of
two visible symmetric extrema on the graph (vorticity, streamfunction) is in
agreement with our equation.

the typhoons.

7.9 The vacuum ﬁelds

We comment on the meaning of the vacuum value of the matter ﬁeld. Ob-
viously, it must be related with the presence, in the physical model, of a
background of vorticity simply given by the gyration of the particles. This
is the sense of the fact that, even at inﬁnity, we have a constant density of
2 = v2. The excitations in the form of large vortices take place

Eq.(226). The subset of self-dual states is much smaller and precisely deﬁned
by Eq.(125).

7.11 Comment on the self-duality

In general the self-duality should be seen as a property of a particular geometrico-
algebraic object : a ﬁber bundle. This consists of a basis manifold (on which
one has to deﬁne an atlas of compatible charts), a ﬁber attached to every
point of the basis manifold (in physics the ﬁber is seldom said space of inter-
nal symmetry) and a group of automorphism of the typical ﬁber. The local
structure on the basis and in the ﬁbre space is Euclidean since they both
are manifolds. One can construct the total space of the ﬁber bundle, which
is locally a Cartesian product of an open set of the basis with the space of
the ﬁber, and a projection operator acting in this total space and projecting
its points on the basis. The transition functions between neighboring charts
consist of elements of the group. A connection is a diﬀerential one-form de-
ﬁned in every point of the total space and taking values in the algebra of
the group. The curvature is the diﬀerential two-form obtained by an exte-
rior diﬀerentiation of the connection one-form. For a concrete example, the
connection is the potential Aµ and the curvature is the ﬁeld strength Fµν of
the electromagnetism, or any other theory expressed in similar terms. There
: applied on a diﬀerential p-form in
is a Hodge duality operator, denoted
a space with n dimensions, it generates a diﬀerential n
p form, such as the
exterior product of these two forms produces a scalar multiple of the unique
n form that can de deﬁned on the n-dimensional space, i.e. a multiple of the
volume form.

−

∗

The self-duality is the property that consists of the equality between the a
diﬀerential form and its Hodge dual; this naturally requires that the space be

53

of even dimension. Only the diﬀerential forms of the order representing half
of the (even) dimension of the space can be self-dual since only in this case
their duals will be of the same order. For example in a space with dimension
four, the diﬀerential two-forms can be self-dual.

In physics, the diﬀerential two-form representing the ﬁeld strength and
its dual are equal at self-duality. But this two-form represents the curvature
of the ﬁbre bundle, therefore at self-duality the curvature is equal to its dual.
In many cases, this equality is realised by the fact that the curvature is zero
and one says that the space is ﬂat.

When the self-duality is realised as a condition of ﬂatness it is possible
to express this equality as the compatibility condition of a system of linear
diﬀerential equations. This makes possible to introduce a Lax operator and
the self-duality equation is exactly integrable by Inverse Scattering Trans-
form. A set of inﬁnite invariants can be found. One example of this type is
the classical sigma model.

In particular cases, (like ours) the geometrical structure is less clear. The
self-duality is expressed by the fact that the action functional is minimized
i.e. the Bogomolnyi limit is saturated.

7.12 Comment on the 6th order potential

The Abelian version of this theory but with the Maxwell term instead of
Chern-Simons is well known from superconductivity theory.
It implies a
potential of only fourth order which provides the symmetrical vacua of the
theory and allows mass generation for the Maxwell photon via the Higgs
mechanism.

However in the present theory a sixth order potential is necessary.
It
has been demonstrated that with only a sixth order potential one can have
self-dual states. This has been shown by a simple veriﬁcation which we
have reproduced in the Section about the energy functional related to the
Lagrangean density.

However the necessity to include a sixth order potential in the Lagrangean
density has a profond origin. This has been shown in series of papers [49],
[50], [51].

It has ben shown that the Bogomolnyi lower bound for the energy and the
ﬁrst-order-in-time diﬀerential equations obtained at self-duality are a prop-
erty of a classical ﬁeld theory which possesses a topological charge. The
theory is a reduction of a supersymmetric (susy) theory in which the topo-
logical charge appears as the central charge of the susy algebraic structure. (
A susy theory is a classical ﬁeld theory in which besides the usual ﬁelds there
are other ﬁeld-variables with the property that they anti-commute, i.e. they

54

are classical spinors). It is interesting the way in which this has been shown
[50],[51]. First it has been shown that any supersymmetric theory which
possesses a topological charge necessarly possesses a Bogomolnyi bound and
equations of motion. Then for a given ﬁeld theory where a topological con-
servation charge exists, it is ﬁrst constructed a supersymmetric extension,
adding the anti-commuting variables and other variables that are necessary
In this extended theory the central
to close the new algebraic structure.
charge of the susy algebra is the topological charge of the initial theory. The
Bogomolnyi bound is identiﬁed. Finally it is shown that returning back from
the susy extension to the original theory, one still preserves the Bogomolnyi
bound. The relation between the potential W in the extended theory and
the potential U in the classical non-susy theory is

U (φ) =

2

∂W
∂φa (cid:19)

a (cid:18)

X
and for a symmetrical two-vacua potential W we have a potential U of sixth
degree in φa.

Lee, Lee and Weinberg [52] show explicitly in an Abelian case how this
form of the potential is obtained from the requirement that the model can be
extended to a N = 2 supersymmetric model. They begin by constructing an
N = 1 supersymmetric generalization of this Chern-Simons Higgs theory, in
2
which the form of the potential f
is not yet speciﬁed. Adding a single
|
to the set of variables of the original
pair of Grassmannian varibales
(cid:1)
model requires to extend the model by introducing additional ﬁelds. This is
(cid:1)
necessary since the supersymmetry transformation must be closed and the

The action contains a bosonic part that has this potential and this is actually
the Abelian version of the model discussed in this work.

The fact that at self-duality the theory is a part of a larger supersymmetric
theory and that this explains the form of the scalar self-interaction may help
us to trace the meaning of the changes we ﬁnd between the sinh-Poisson
equation (for the ideal ﬂuid) and the double-sinh-Poisson equation, for the
ﬂuid of ions with Larmor gyration.

The special Higgs potential that appears in the Lagrangean density and
leads to self-dual states has a symmetric minimum which is degenerate with
the symmetry-breaking one. This means that the system can have non-
topological solitons which verify the same self-dual equations.

continuity equation, one obtains an equation for the electrostatic potential

The calculations from this Appendix may be useful as a guide for a ﬁrst
contact with the methods of the theory of non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld interacting
with nonlinear matter ﬁeld. Here the calculations are not pedagogical (in
particular we treat asymmetrically the ﬁelds Aµ and A†µ) and we suggest
that after these ﬁrst steps other lectures are necessary.

11 Appendix D : Notes on deﬁnitions

The information about the algebraic structure implied in the present model
can be found in [32]. A simple group is a group that does not have invariant
subgroups, except of the identity and the whole group.

A simple algebra is an algebra that does not have proper ideals.
A semi-simple algebra is an algebra that can be written as a direct

The dimension of a simple Lie algebra is the total number of linearly

sum of simple algebras.
U (1) is not simple.

independent generators.

91

The rank of the algebra, r, is the maximum number of simultaneously

diagonalisable generators of a simple Lie algebra.

In the Cartan-Weil analysis the generators are written in a basis where

they can be devided into two sets:

•

the Cartan subalgebra, which is the maximal Abelian subalgebra of
G. It contains r diagonalisable generators Hi, i = 1, ..., r

[Hi, Hj] = 0 , i, j = 1, ..., r

(D.1)

•

the remaining generators of the algebra G are deﬁned such as they
satisfy the eigenvalue problems

[Hi, Eµ] = αiEµ , i = 1, ..., r

(D.2)

It results that the constants αi can be considered structure constants of

the algebra in the Cartan-Weil basis.

For each generator Eµ there are r constant numbers, αi, i = 1, ..., r ; if
we consider a space with dimension r, then the set of points (α1, α2, ..., αr)
corresponding to one generator Eµ is a point in this space. This space is
called root space and the name root comes from the fact the the vector
(α1, α2, ..., αr) is obtained by solving the equation (D.2), an eigenvalue prob-
lem.

Two problems are connected and are treated together using the Dynkin

diagrams of the simple algebras:

1. to classify all possible systems of roots for the algebras of a given

rank r;

2. to ﬁnd all possible irreducible representations of a simple group
G. This means to identify a system of physical states on which the
generators Eµ are acting (the states belong to a Hilbert space) with
the property that these states are transformed between them (or, the
system of states is closed under the action of the generators Eµ). These
states are taken as the basis for an irreducible representation.

Considering the physical states which are the basis of the irreducible rep-
, they can be labelled by the r eigenvalues of the diagonalisable

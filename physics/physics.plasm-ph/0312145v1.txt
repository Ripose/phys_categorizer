Abstract

A spherically symmetric ﬂuid code that includes the relativistic eﬀects of hot electrons has

been newly developed.

In the present simulations, I attempt to implode a target shell of laser

fusion using a nanosecond pulse; then, an additional heating short pulse is injected into the

coronal plasma surrounding a highly compressed core. I found that the relativistic eﬀects of hot

electrons on electron transport are likely to inhibit the heat ﬂows, and to reduce thermonuclear

fusion neutrons signiﬁcantly. This feature may be important for oﬀ-center fast ignition and burn

of fusion targets.

The relativistic eﬀects of hot electrons in laboratory plasmas have attracted much inter-

ests for the past decades [1], particularly, relating to laser fusion fast ignition (LFFI) whose

scenario is achieved by standard high-compression, irradiation of a hole-boring laser beam,

irradiation of an ignitor laser beam, and thermonuclear burn [2]. When high-intensity short

pulse laser light is impinged on the coronal plasma surrounding a highly compressed core in

the ’hole-boring’ and ’ignition’ stages, energetic particles are sprayed through various mech-

anisms.

In order to investigate the relativistic electron transport carrying huge currents,

substantial studies were performed on the multidimensional relativistic particle-in-cell [3] as

well as magneto-hydrodynamic [4] simulations.

Moreover, the fast ignition conditions of the compressed targets have been presented

in some publications [5, 6, 7, 8].

Indeed, it is important to survey the energy transport

and relaxation in dense plasmas over a large spatiotemporal system of R > 101 − 102 µm

and t > 1 ps. Concerning the extension of the analysis of ignition conditions, we are now

strongly encouraged to improve the transport coeﬃcients so as to compare them with those

for kinetic simulations [9, 10] and experiments [11, 12]. That is why, I attempted to construct

a computational ﬂuid code that includes relativistic eﬀects of electron transport. In this

code, the transport properties of hot electrons are fully consistent with the current-neutral

electric ﬁelds self-induced in plasmas, as discussed in ref. [13] in detail.

In this paper, I argue that in the context of the LFFI, heat ﬂux inhibition owing to

relativistic eﬀects of electrons degrades the transport eﬃciency of deﬂagration thermal waves,

and leads to some reductions in the neutron yields. This is essentially because the drift

velocity carrying heat asymptotically approaches the speed of light. Since the velocity

moment of the heat ﬂux is large, the energy of electrons carrying dominant heat (EE-CDH)

is much larger than the thermal energy: TEE−CDH ≈ 7Tth. Thus, it is expected that the

relativistic eﬀects of electron heat transport can be observed even in the energy domain

of Tth ∼ 101 − 102 keV.
by irradiating a moderate-intensity laser light of ILλ2

It is noteworthy that such situations can be easily established
L ≥ 1016 W/cm2 − µm2 [14]. As for

astrophysical aspects, the issue presented here is relevant to supernova outbursts [15].

The spherically symmetric ﬂuid code has been developed on the Lagrangian frame dm =
4πρr2dr with the speciﬁc volume of V = ρ−1. This solves a set of two-temperature ﬂuid

equations for an ideal gas, including the relativistically corrected equations for the internal

energy of electrons. That is,

some α values are shown in Table I. Note that for α ≫ 1, eq. (4) asymptotically approaches
unity, and for α ≪ 1, approaches the expression of ˜κe = [5(2π)1/2/32]α1/2 [18]. Another

important point is that the heat capacity tends to increase in high-temperature regimes, up

to twofold in the ultrarelativistic limit. Making use of the implicit ﬁnite diﬀerential scheme,

we can numerically integrate the internal energy eqs. (2)-(7) as outlined in the Appendix.

In the LFFI context, of course, one can also construct some kinds of kinetic simulation

codes [19] to investigate asymmetric transport involving magnetic ﬁelds [3, 9, 10], but their

allowed spatiotemporal ranges are small. Regarding the present scheme, the macroscopic

transport properties in supersolid density regions and the eﬀects of a more realistic plasma

gradient as well, can be revealed as a trade-oﬀ for missing the smaller spatiotemporal scales,

such as the Debye length and the plasma oscillation period. Along the diﬀusion approx-

imation adopted under geometrical constraint, irradiating laser intensity IL is traced by

vg(∂IL/∂r) = −νabsIL, where vg and νabs denote the group velocity of light and the absorp-

tion coeﬃcient, respectively [20]. For simplicity, in the present simulations, the laser light

is set at normal incidence. The ray deposits its own energy, when propagating through the

corona, and is then resonantly damped at the critical density. Note that in eq. (1) radiation

pressure Pph is also taken into account.

Furthermore, we are concerned with the thermonuclear reactions of deuterium-tritium

(DT) and deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion. The rate equations for number density of the

tritium NT and deuterium ND [21] were solved in a postprocessing manner. Assuming the

local self-heating due to charged particles, one obtains the source terms of eqs. (2) and (3)
as functions of the heating power densities of SDT ∝ hvσDT i NDNT and SDD ∝ hvσDDi N 2
D

[22]. Although these models are rather crude, they still have merit for the investigation of

fundamental transport processes of electrons. As shown later, it is instructive to compare

the neutron yields derived from various models of electron transport.

In the following, I demonstrate how a highly compressed fuel can be heated due to

electron transport, and ignited. For convenience, ’case A’ and ’case B’ are used as references

for simulations with and without relativistic eﬀects, respectively. The initial laser conditions

and target parameters are shown in Table II. Hereafter, the target parameters are ﬁxed.

The total mass of the target shell is on the order of that presented in ref. [23], and the initial

aspect ratio of the shell is about (R/∆R)0 ∼ 10. High compression of the shell, maintaining

a low entropy, is carried out by the Gaussian pulse shaping of driver laser light. The outer

4

thin ablator of carbonized DT (CDT) is blown oﬀ just before the deceleration phase, leaving

the dense compressed core of DT fuel. Hydrodynamic instabilities concomitant with the

low-entropy implosion are omitted for the moment.

In Fig. 1(a) for case A, I show a ﬂow diagram of implosion with additional heating.

The total mesh number is J = 102, and the ﬂow lines are displayed each tenth mesh.

At t = 2.25 ns, an additional 10 PW (1016 W) power with the pulse duration of τ =

1 + ILλ2

1 ps is deposited at a relativistically modiﬁed cut-oﬀ density which is deﬁned by nc rel =
L/ (1.37 × 1018 W/cm2 − µm2), where nc = 9.97 × 1020 (1.06 µm/λL)2 cm−3 is
nc
the nonrelativistic cut-oﬀ density. In this case, the pulse intensity becomes about ILλ2
L ∼
1018 W/cm2 − µm2. One can see of the detonation shock propagating radially inwards, as

p

well as the explosion, associated with the oﬀ-center fast ignition. The ﬂow diagram without

additional heating is shown in Fig. 1(b). It is conﬁrmed that ignition does not occur in the

standard implosion of the small target when using a driver laser energy of about 4 kJ.

The spatial proﬁles of plasma temperature and mass density at t = 2.251 ns, the moment

that the additional heating power of 10 PW is switched oﬀ, are shown in Fig. 2 for cases A

and B. One may notice that in the regions of r = 0 − 35 µm, the stagnating isobaric

core where a central hot spot is surrounded with cold dense plasma (DT main fuel) is well

established as a result of the low-entropy implosion. The equilibrium static pressure reaches

P = Pe + Pi > 10 Gbar. It turns out that nonlinear propagation of the deﬂagration wave

fuel as hTei =

directly heats the main fuel. Here we deﬁne the average electron temperature of the main

temperature is hTei ≃ 9.9 keV. On the other hand, in case A, the heat ﬂux inhibition due

to relativistic eﬀects lowers the temperature to hTei ≃ 6.6 keV. This reﬂects the factor

˜κe/˜cve ≃ 0.75 for Te ≃ 25 keV in the tenuous corona (see Table I). The relativistic eﬀects

on energy transfer between electrons and ions are small.

In Fig. 3 for case A, I show the spatial proﬁles of plasma temperature and mass density,

just before the irradiation of the ignitor pulse (t = 2.25 ns), during the irradiation (t =

2.2505 ns), and just after the irradiation (t = 2.251 ns). While the coronal electrons are

rapidly heated up to Te ∼ 25 keV, the deﬂagration wavefront slowly propagates in the cold

dense region where the heat capacity is very large, and the steep temperature gradient at the

wavefront self-generates a longitudinal electric ﬁeld having a maximum value on the order

5

of magnitude of Emax ∼ e−1|∂Te/∂r| ∼ 1010 V/m [18]. For the plasma parameters shown in

Figs. 2 and 3, the heating rate of the DT fuel ions is estimated to be dTi/dt ∼ 1−1.5 keV/ps,

when assuming the Coulomb logarithm of lnΛ ∼ 5. The fuel can be, therefore, heated to

the ignition temperature until the stagnating core is disassembled.

Let us show the additional heating power dependencies of neutron yields in Fig. 4 for

both cases A and B. Within the range of 0.1 − 20 PW, an additional power with the pulse

duration of τ = 1 ps is injected at t = 2.250 ns. It is found that in the present model the

threshold power for ignition seems to be about 1 PW, corresponding to the energy of 1 kJ.

The pulse power of about 20 PW leads to a considerable increase in neutron yields, which

are of the order of one thousand times that in the case without additional heating. The

time-integrated bremsstrahlung loss is 60 − 70 J at most. It is noted that the ﬂux inhibition

degrades the heating eﬃciency, thereby reducing the neutron yields, particularly, when the

additional power is, in this model, in the range of 3 − 10 PW. The yields tend to be sensitive

to the timing of the irradiation of the ignitor pulse [24, 25].

The present predictions of the neutron yields and the threshold power for ignition may be

rather pessimistic for determining the lower limit of the yields. In order to argue this point,

I show, in Fig. 4, some results of the Fokker-Planck simulation coupled with spherically

imploding hydrodynamics [24]. In this calculated example, the laser irradiation conditions

and target parameters are similar to those presented in Table II. It is assumed that the

absorbed energy of an ignitor pulse is transfered by 50 % into the high-energy tail electrons

of the temperature (variance) of 50 keV. As shown in the ﬁgure, the eﬀects of nonlocal

transport seem to increase the neutron yields, since the hot tail electrons, which possess a

longer mean-free path, deeply penetrate into the compressed plasma, preheating the fuel.

It is noted that such nonlocality, as well as anisotropy of energy deposition, could be an

advantage to the LFFI. The details should be clariﬁed by multidimensional ﬂuid simulations

including relativistic kinetics in the future.

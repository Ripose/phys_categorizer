Abstract

We examine the equilibrium properties of hot, dilute, non-relativistic plas-
mas. The partition function and density correlation functions of a classical
plasma with several species are expressed in terms of a functional integral
over electrostatic potential distributions. This is a convenient formulation
for performing a well-deﬁned perturbative expansion. The leading order,
ﬁeld-theoretic tree approximation automatically includes the eﬀects of De-
bye screening. (No further partial resummations are needed for this eﬀect.)
Subleading, one-loop corrections are easily evaluated. The two-loop correc-
tions, however, have ultraviolet divergences. These correspond to the short-
distance, logarithmic divergence which is encountered in the spatial integral of
the Boltzmann exponential when it is expanded to third order in the Coulomb
potential. Such divergences do not appear in the underlying quantum theory
— they are rendered ﬁnite by quantum ﬂuctuations. We show how such di-
vergences may be removed and the correct ﬁnite theory obtained by introduc-
ing additional local interactions in the manner of modern eﬀective quantum
ﬁeld theories. We compute the two-loop induced coupling by exploiting a
non-compact su(1, 1) symmetry of the hydrogen atom. This enables us to ob-
tain explicit results for density-density correlation functions through two-loop
order and thermodynamic quantities through three-loop order. The induced
couplings are shown to obey renormalization group equations, and these equa-
tions are used to characterize all leading logarithmic contributions in the the-
ory. A linear combination of pressure and energy and number densities is
shown to be described by a ﬁeld-theoretic anomaly. The eﬀective Lagrangian
method that we employ yields a very simple demonstration that, at long dis-
tance, correlation functions have an algebraic fall oﬀ (because of quantum
eﬀects) rather than the exponential damping of classical Debye screening.
We use the eﬀective theory to compute, easily and explicitly, this leading long
distance behavior of density correlation functions.

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

Our work applies contemporary methods of eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theory to the tra-
ditional problem of a multicomponent, fully ionized hot (but non-relativistic) plasma. In
this regime, a classical description might appear to suﬃce. But the short-distance (1/r)
singularity of the Coulomb potential gives rise to divergences in higher-order terms. Taming
these divergences requires the introduction of quantum mechanics. Quantum ﬂuctuations
smooth out the short-distance singularity of the Coulomb potential so that the quantum,
many particle Coulomb system is completely ﬁnite. This necessity for including quantum
eﬀects, even in a dilute plasma, is discussed later in this introduction when the relevant
parameters which characterize the various physical processes in the plasma are examined.

As we shall see, contemporary eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theory methods simplify high-order
perturbative computations and generally illuminate the structure of the theory. Eﬀective
quantum ﬁeld theories do, however, utilize a somewhat complicated formal apparatus in-
volving regularization, counter terms, and renormalization. In an eﬀort to make our work
available to a wider audience, we shall develop the theory in several stages, and attempt
to give a largely self-contained presentation.1 A brief review of some of the basic quantum
ﬁeld theory techniques used in our paper is presented in Appendix F. We begin, in Section
II, by casting the purely classical theory in terms of a functional integral, show how dimen-
sional continuation is convenient even at this purely classical level to avoid inﬁnite Coulomb
self-energies, and show how the simple saddle-point evaluation of the functional integral —
known as a tree approximation in quantum ﬁeld theory — immediately gives the traditional
resummation that provides Debye screening of the long-distance Coulomb potential. The
ﬁrst sub-leading, so-called “one-loop,” corrections to the plasma thermodynamics and corre-
lation functions are also evaluated in this section. These lowest-order results are also used to
illustrate general relations among correlations functions which are described more formally,
and systematically, in Appendix A.

The divergence associated with the singular, short-range behavior of the Coulomb po-
tential ﬁrst arises at the subsequent, “two-loop” level of approximation as shown in Section
III. This section explains how the previous purely classical theory is obtained from a limit of
the quantum theory, and how the quantum corrections that tame the classical divergences
appear in the form of induced couplings that contain compensating divergences. This dis-
cussion uses various results on functional determinants and Green’s functions contained in
Appendix B. Although it is relatively easy to construct the “counter terms” that render
the classical theory ﬁnite, it is considerably more diﬃcult to obtain the ﬁnite pieces in the
induced couplings that ensure that a calculation in the eﬀective theory correctly reproduces
the corresponding result in the full quantum theory. In the latter part of this section the
“matching conditions” for the leading two-loop induced couplings are derived, and the two-
loop induced couplings are explicitly evaluated. The key to this evaluation is the exploitation
of an su(1, 1) symmetry of the Coulomb problem, which permits one to derive a simple and
explicit representation for the two-particle contribution to the density-density correlation

1Other discussions of eﬀective ﬁeld theory techniques, applied to quite diﬀerent physical problems,
may be found in Refs. [1,2] and references therein.

function. This su(1, 1) symmetry, and its consequences, are presented in Appendix D. Sec-
tion III concludes with an examination of the necessary inclusion in the eﬀective theory of
interactions involving non-zero frequency components of the electrostatic potential.

It is worth noting that our determination of the induced couplings is based on examining
Fourier transforms of number-density correlation functions at small but non-vanishing wave
number. We use this method because these functions — at non-vanishing wave number —
may be computed in a strictly perturbative fashion with no resummation needed to account
for the Debye screening that is necessary to make the zero wave number limit of these corre-
lation functions ﬁnite.2 Matching in this fashion enables us to use the simple pure Coulomb
potential for which the exact group-theoretical techniques apply. Our procedure is roughly
equivalent to computing the second-order virial coeﬃcient for a pure Coulomb potential,
except that this coeﬃcient has a long-distance, infrared divergence. This logarithmic diver-
gence is removed by Debye screening, but there is always the diﬃculty of determining the
constant under the logarithm. Our method avoids this diﬃculty. Years ago, W. Ebeling
[and later Ebeling working together with collaborators] computed the second-order virial
coeﬃcient for a pure Coulomb potential with a long-distance cutoﬀ, and then related this
quantity to other ladder approximation calculations so as to obtain results that are, except
for one term, equivalent to, and consistent with, our results for the induced couplings. Their
work is summarized in ref [4]. This seminal work is certainly very impressive and signiﬁ-
cant, but it is much more complex than our approach, and (at least in our view) is far more
diﬃcult to understand in detail.

With the leading induced couplings in hand, we turn in Section IV to compute all the
thermodynamic quantities and the density-density correlators to two-loop order. As far
as we have been able to determine, the two-loop results for the density-density correlation
functions obtained in Section IV are new. Various integrals required for these computations
are evaluated in Appendix C, and an alternative derivation of the two-loop thermodynamic
results using compact functional methods appears in Appendix G.

The thermodynamic results are extended to the next, three-loop, order in Section V. We
give complete, explicit results for the pressure (or equation of state), Helmholtz free energy,
and internal energy, as well as the relations between particle densities and chemical potentials
in a general multi-component plasma. We also display the specializations of the equation
of state for the cases of a binary electron-proton plasma, and a one component plasma (in
the presence of a constant neutralizing background charge density). As discussed at the end
of this section, a genuine classical limit exists only for the special case of a one-component
plasma. As a check on our results, Appendix E presents an independent, self-contained
calculation of the leading O(¯h2) corrections to the equation of state of a one-component
plasma in the semi-classical regime.

Prior results in the literature, corresponding to our three-loop level of accuracy, for the
free energy and/or the equation of state go back more than 25 years. The book by Kraeft,
Kremp, Ebeling, and R¨opke [5] quotes a result for the Helmholtz free energy which, except

2 The utility of matching at small but non-vanishing wavenumber, thereby enabling one to ignore
the eﬀects of Debye screening, has been emphasized by Braaten and Nieto [3].

for the omission of one term and a few trivial misprints, agrees with our expression.3 A
fairly recent publication by Alastuey and Perez [6] contains an expression for the Helmholtz
free energy, to three loop order, which does agree precisely with our result. For the special
case of a one-component plasma, recent papers by DeWitt, Riemann, Schlanges, Sakakura,
and Kraft [7,8] report results for some, but not all, of the terms contained in the three-
loop pressure. These partial results are consistent with our three-loop pressure, once an
unpublished erratum of J. Riemann is taken into account.

Just as in any eﬀective ﬁeld theory, the induced couplings that must be introduced to
remove the inﬁnities of the classical plasma theory obey renormalization group equations. In
Section VI we show how these renormalization group equations may be employed to compute
leading logarithmic terms in the partition function — terms involving powers of logarithms
whose argument is the (assumed large) ratio of the Debye screening length to the quantum
thermal wave length of the plasma. Since Planck’s constant, which carries the dimensions
of action, does not appear in classical physics, fewer dimensionless ratios can be formed in
a classical theory than in its quantum counterpart. In particular, the partition function of
the classical theory depends upon a restricted number of dimensionless parameters, from
which a linear relation between the pressure, internal energy, and average number densities
follows. This relation is altered by the necessary quantum-mechanical corrections. Section
VI also explains how this alteration of the linear relationship is connected to “anomalies”
brought about by the renormalization procedure that makes the classical theory ﬁnite.

We conclude our work, in Section VII, with an examination of the long-distance behavior
of the density-density correlation function. Despite the presence of Debye screening, it is
known that quantum ﬂuctuations cause correlations to fall only algebraically with distance
[10–12]. Using the eﬀective theory, we compute the coeﬃcient of the resulting leading power-
law decline in a very simple and eﬃcient fashion.

It should be emphasized that the major purpose of this paper is to introduce the methods
of modern quantum ﬁeld theory into the traditional ﬁeld of plasma physics. Although many
of the results that we derive and describe have been obtained previously, the methods that
we employ to obtain these results are new, and they substantially reduce the computational
eﬀort as well as illuminating the general structure of the theory. Although our work may
have the length, it is not a review paper; its length results from our desire to make the
presentation self-contained so that it may be read by someone who is neither an expert in
plasma physics nor quantum ﬁeld theory. Since our work is not a survey of a ﬁeld, we have
not endeavored to provide anything resembling a comprehensive bibliography.

A. Relevant Scales and Dimensionless Parameters

Various dimensionless parameters characterize the relative importance of diﬀerent phys-
ical eﬀects in the plasma. Before plunging into the details of our work, we ﬁrst pause to
introduce these parameters and discuss their signiﬁcance.

3 See Eqs. (2.50)–(2.55) of Ref. [5]. See footnote 44 on page 79 for details.

Let e and n denote the charge and number density of a typical ionic species in the plasma.
For simplicity of presentation in this qualitative discussion, we shall assume that the charges
and densities of all species in the multicomponent plasma are roughly comparable, and shall
ignore the sums over diﬀerent species which should really be present in formulas such as
(1.2) below. The subsequent quantitative treatment will, of course, remedy this sloppiness.
We shall be concerned with neutral plasmas which are suﬃciently dilute so that the average
Coulomb energy of a particle is small compared to its kinetic energy. We use energy units
to measure the temperature T and write β = 1/T . In the ideal gas limit, the average kinetic
energy is equal to 3
2T . The Coulomb potential is e2/(4πr) in the rationalized units which
we shall use. So the typical Coulomb energy is e2/(4πd) where d
n−1/3 denotes the mean
inter-particle separation. Hence, the dimensionless parameter

≡

e2

Γ

≡

n1/3

is essentially the ratio of the potential to kinetic energy in the plasma, and it is an often used
measure of the relative strength of Coulomb interactions in a plasma. However, we shall see
that Γ is not the proper dimensionless parameter which governs the size of corrections in
the classical perturbation expansion.

A charge placed in the plasma is screened by induced charges. The screening length
equals the inverse of the Debye wave number which we denote as κ. It is given (to lowest
order in a dilute plasma) by

A diﬀerent measure of the strength of Coulomb interactions in the plasma is deﬁned by

This is the ratio of the electrostatic energy of two particles separated by a Debye screening
length to the temperature (which is roughly the same as the average kinetic energy in the
plasma). Equivalently, it is ratio of the “Coulomb distance”

to the screening length κ−1. The Coulomb distance dC is the separation at which the
electrostatic potential energy of a pair of charges equals the temperature.4

The number of particles Nκ contained within a sphere whose radius equals the screening

length κ−1 is inversely related to g,

4 Dynamically, the Coulomb distance dC is also the impact parameter necessary for an O(1)
change in direction to occur during the scattering of a typical pair of particles in the plasma.

Hence the weak coupling condition g
1 is equivalent to the requirement that the num-
ber of charges within a “screening volume” be large, Nκ ≫
1. In this case, a mean-ﬁeld
treatment of Debye screening holds to leading order, and perturbation theory is a controlled
approximation.

≪

It is easy to check that the two measures of interaction strength, g and Γ, are related by
g = √4π Γ 3. However, we shall show in our subsequent development that g, not Γ, is the
dimensionless parameter whose increasing integer powers characterize the size of successive
terms in the classical perturbative expansion for thermodynamic properties of the plasma.
As we shall discuss, the classical perturbation series has a convenient graphical representation
in which contributions at n-th order in perturbation theory are represented by graphs (or
Feynman diagrams) with n loops. We shall see that g is the “loop expansion” parameter,
such that contributions represented by n-loop graphs are of order gn. Although g and Γ are
directly related as noted above, we emphasize again that it is g which is the correct classical
expansion parameter.

To bring out this point even more strongly, we note that the screened Debye potential
between two charges ea and eb a distance r apart is given by eaeb e−κr/(4πr). The modi-
ﬁcation of the self energy of a particle of charge ea when it is brought into the plasma is
given by half the diﬀerence between the Debye potential and its Coulomb limit for the case
of zero charge separation, 1
e2
a κ/(8π). Each particle in
the plasma makes this correction to the thermodynamic internal energy of the plasma, and
so including this leading order correction to the energy density gives

which shows the appearance of g, or more explicitly βe2
aκ/(8π), as the correct Coulomb
coupling constant in this case. This result for the internal energy which we have heuristically
obtained agrees with the correct one-loop result (2.84) that is derived below.

A classical treatment of a plasma with purely Coulombic interactions is, however, never
strictly valid. The classical partition function fails to exist due to the singular short-distance
behavior of the Coulomb interaction. This can be seen in an elementary fashion directly
from the divergence, for opposite signed charges, of the Boltzmann-weighted integral over the
relative separation of two charges,
. In the perturbative expansion of

the classical theory, this problem ﬁrst manifests itself at two-loop order through the diagram

Once screening eﬀects are properly included, the large-distance logarithmic divergence of
this integral will be cut oﬀ at the classical Debye screening length κ−1. But no classical
mechanism exists to remove the short-distance divergence of the integral. To tame this
divergence, one must include quantum eﬀects.

The non-relativistic quantum-mechanical description of a charged plasma is completely
ﬁnite; quantum ﬂuctuations cut-oﬀ the short-distance divergences of the classical theory.

This is in accord with the average (rms) momentum of
temperature T = 1/β. We will refer to λ as the “thermal wavelength”. This length sets the
scale of the limiting precision with which a quantum particle in the plasma can be localized.
Using the thermal wavelength as the lower limit in the integral (1.8), and the Debye length
as the upper limit, one obtains a ﬁnite result,

q

which replaces the inﬁnity that would otherwise arise in a purely classical treatment. This
logarithm of the ratio of a quantum wavelength to the screening length will necessarily
appear in coeﬃcients of two-loop (and higher order) contributions to all thermodynamic
quantities.6

This quick discussion shows that quantum mechanics must enter into the description
of the thermodynamics of a plasma — at least if two-loop or better accuracy is desired.
In addition to regularizing the divergences of the classical theory, quantum mechanics also
provides “kinematic” corrections via the inﬂuence of quantum statistics. To estimate the

only repulsive Coulomb interactions. In this special case, the Boltzmann factor exp

itself provides a short-distance cutoﬀ at the Coulomb distance dC = βe2/4π, resulting in logarithmic
terms of the form ln(dC κ) = ln g.
[In this regard, see Eq. (3.84) and its discussion.] However, if
the quantum thermal wavelength is larger than the Coulomb distance, λ > dC, then this purely
classical removal of the would-be short-distance divergence is physically incorrect, for the quantum
eﬀects already come into play at larger distances, and the correct logarithmic term has the form
ln(λκ). The neutrality of a binary or multicomponent plasma requires that they have attractive
as well as repulsive Coulomb interactions. These plasmas thus always require quantum-mechanical
ﬂuctuations to remove their potential short-distance divergences.

We shall always assume that the plasma is dilute,

so that a fugacity expansion is appropriate. This condition that the plasma be dilute can
be stated in another way.
If all single-particle states in momentum space were ﬁlled up

to a (Fermi) momentum pF , the density would take on the value n = gS p3

However, it is the fugacity z, not this ratio, that is the appropriate expansion parameter.

Once quantum mechanics enters the analysis, another dimensionless parameter involving
the ratio of two energies appears. This is the Coulomb potential energy for two particles
separated by one thermal wavelength, divided by the temperature,

Recalling the deﬁnition (1.9) of the thermal wave length and noting that the average (rms)

This parameter is also related to the ratio of temperature to binding energy of two particles
in the plasma with equal and opposite7 charge e and reduced mass m. The hydrogenic
ground state of two such particles has a binding energy of

The ratio of this energy to the temperature is just η2 (up to a factor of π),

Note that the quantum parameter η becomes small at suﬃciently high temperature, but that
it diverges at low temperatures or in the formal ¯h
limits. We should also
remark that the quantum eﬀects measured by η only appear in two-loop and higher-order
processes. Thus these eﬀects are suppressed by a factor of g2.

The quantum parameter η, together with the particle densities, also provides an estimate
of how many bound atoms are present in a dilute plasma. The Saha equation, which is simply
the condition for chemical equilibrium between bound atoms and ionized particles, states
that the fraction of bound atoms in the plasma is8

n λ3 eβǫ = n λ3 eπη2

.

(1.21)

Here λ refers to the thermal wavelength corresponding to the reduced mass of the two
charges. Thus, for a dilute plasma to be (nearly) fully ionized, the parameter πη2, for oppo-
ln nλ3. If the plasma is suﬃciently dense
site signed charges, must be small compared to
that the Debye screening length becomes comparable to the size of isolated atoms, then the
Saha equation — which neglects interactions with the plasma — breaks down. Such plas-
mas can remain essentially fully ionized, even when the Saha equation predicts a substantial
number of bound atoms, because Debye screening shortens the range of attractive interac-
tions and eﬀectively prevents the formation of bound states. The perturbative treatment
which we shall develop applies only to the case of well ionized plasmas.

−

Underlying any eﬀective ﬁeld theory, such as the one that we develop in this paper, is a
separation between the length scales of interest and the scales of the underlying dynamics.

7For the general case of opposite but unequal charges, e2 is replaced by the product of charges
eaeb.

−
8 This is just the requirement that the chemical potential plus binding energy of the lowest bound
state equal the sum of the chemical potentials of the bound state constituents. Since an atom in
free space has an inﬁnite number of bound levels, and the presence of the surrounding particles in
the plasma produces screening eﬀects, the Saha equation only provides a rough indication of the
numbers of bound atoms present. Indeed, the fraction of bound atoms in a plasma is intrinsically
only an approximately deﬁned concept.

11

Our length scales of interest will be of order of the Debye screening length κ−1 or longer.
The relevant microscopic scales are the Coulomb distance dC = βe2/4π and the thermal
wavelength λ. The condition that the screening length κ−1 be much larger that the Coulomb
distance dC is just the statement that the classical loop expansion parameter must be small,

As noted above, the thermal wavelength λ will provide the short-distance cutoﬀ in expres-
sions, such as Eq. (1.10), which diverge in the purely classical theory. We assume that

so that there is a large separation between the scales of interest and this short distance
cutoﬀ. The quantum theory will generate additional corrections suppressed by powers of
(λκ) which, since λ is proportional to Planck’s constant ¯h, represent an ascending series in
powers of ¯h, in contrast to the ln ¯h eﬀects arising from the short-distance cutoﬀ.

In order to have a systematic expansion in which the size of diﬀerent eﬀects can be easily
categorized, we will treat the Coulomb parameter η = βe2/4πλ as a number that is formally
of order one. Consequently, if we regard κλ as the basic small parameter which justiﬁes the
use of an eﬀective ﬁeld theory, then g = βe2κ/4π = η(κλ) is O(κλ), while the diluteness
parameter nλ3 is O ((κλ)2), thus formally justifying the inequalities g

The highly ionized plasma at the core of the Sun provides an example of astrophysical
interest. This plasma is mostly composed of electrons and protons. We take the nominal
107 K, and the electron and proton densities
values for the central temperature as T = 1.5
1025/cm3. Since this temperature is to be compared to atomic energies,
as ne = np = 5.0
electron volts are far more convenient units, with T = 1.3 KeV. It is also convenient to think
10−9
of distances and densities in terms of the atomic length unit, the Bohr radius a0 = 5.3
0. Since e2/4πa0 = 27 eV, and a0 = 4π¯h2/mee2, it is easy to
cm. Thus ne = np = 7.4/a3
ﬁnd that the Debye wave number at the Sun’s center is given by κ = 2.0/a0 and that the
electron’s quantum thermal wave length is λe = 0.36a0, with the proton wave length a factor
of √1840 smaller, λp = 8.4
10−3a0. Hence, at the center of the Sun, the classical loop
expansion parameter is quite small, g = βe2κ/4π = 0.042. For the proton,

neλ3
e/2 = 0.17 is small but not insigniﬁcant, which means that the Fermi-Dirac correction to
Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics for the electron are a few percent. Although the Saha equation
predicts that there are 20% or so neutral hydrogen atoms in the core of the sun, this is wrong
since the Debye screening length is half the Bohr radius. The core of the Sun is essentially
completely ionized. The fact that κλe is only slightly less than one means that the utility
of the eﬀective theory (for describing electron contributions to the thermodynamics at the
core of the Sun) cannot really be judged until one knows whether κλ or, for example, κλ/2π
appears as the natural expansion parameter. And there is only one way to ﬁnd out — one
must compute multiple terms in the perturbative expansion and examine the stability of the
series for the actual parameters of interest.

B. Utility of the Eﬀective Theory

For a suﬃciently dilute ionized plasma, all corrections to ideal gas behavior are negligible.
As the plasma density increases, the leading corrections are very well known and come from
either the inclusion of quantum statistics for the electrons or the ﬁrst order inclusion of
Debye screening. At this “trivial” level of eﬀort, the resulting equation of state is easy to
write down:

−

(1.28)

Here n is the total particle density (ions plus electrons), and ze is the electron fugacity,
which is related to the electron number density as shown in Eq. (1.14). The electron fu-
gacity corrections just come from combining Eqs. (1.13) and (1.14) [and noting that in the
thermodynamic limit βp = (ln Z)/
], while the Debye screening correction will be derived
in section II [Eq. (2.81)]. Since the ions are so much more massive than the electrons, their
fugacity will be very small, and their quantum statistics corrections may be neglected.

V

The eﬀective theory we construct incorporates systematically higher-order interaction
eﬀects not contained in the trivial equation of state (1.28). In sections IV and V we will
give explicit forms for the complete second and third order corrections to the equation of
state expanded in powers of the loop expansion parameter g = βe2κ/4π. These results are
valid provided the temperature and density are not in a regime where:

1. The electron density is so large that an expansion in electron fugacity is useless. This
occurs when the electrons are nearly degenerate and their quantum degeneracy pressure
becomes a dominant eﬀect.

2. The temperature is so low that the loop expansion of the eﬀective theory is useless.

This happens when the plasma ceases to be nearly fully ionized.

3. The temperature is so high that a non-relativistic treatment is inadequate. This re-
quires that the temperature be small in comparison with the electron rest energy of
511 KeV.

values of the density and temperature quoted above as characteristic of the solar interior

All corrections to the ideal gas limit are small, but the second order correction is larger than
the ﬁrst. However, it is important to understand that our expansion of the eﬀective theory is
based on formally treating the Coulomb parameters η = βe2/4πλ of all species as numbers
of order one. As indicated in Eq. (1.25), this means that quantum statistics corrections
proportional to the k-th power of fugacity (or nλ3) are automatically included at 2k-loop
order in the eﬀective theory. For the solar plasma, because the electron fugacity is small, but
larger than the plasma coupling g, the dominant correction to ideal gas behavior comes from
quantum statistics, not from Debye screening. Consequently, a more instructive comparison
is to examine the size of corrections generated by the eﬀective theory after removing (or
resuming) the non-interacting quantum statistics corrections. This comparison gives

Both the quantum statistics series (1.31), and the eﬀective theory expansion (1.30) are now
quite well behaved. For these parameter values, it appears that the three-loop eﬀective
theory result (1.30), combined with the ﬁrst three terms10 in the fugacity expansion (1.31),
will correctly predict the equation of state to within an accuracy of a few parts11 in 104.

9For this comparison, we assume that the plasma contains only protons and electrons. This is not
realistic very near the center of the sun, where a signiﬁcant abundance of helium is also present.

10 Adding the quadratic electron fugacity correction [that is, the O(z2
e ) term in (1.28), or the
10−3 term in (1.31)] to the three-loop eﬀective ﬁeld theory result is entirely reasonable since this
quantum statistics correction is in fact the dominant part of the complete four-loop contribution
of the eﬀective theory when the Coulomb parameter for the electron is small, βe2/4πλe ≪
1, as
it is in the Sun. The last term of Eq. (1.31) is the free-particle limit of the six-loop contribution
in our expansion of the eﬀective theory. This cubic fugacity correction, for our characteristic solar
parameters, makes only a 10−4 correction to the equation of state.

11 We remind the reader that portions of the solar neutrino spectrum are exceptionally sensitive
to the central temperature. So a very small change in the equation of state can potentially produce
a measurable change in the solar neutrino ﬂux.

Missing from the above quantitative results, and from our analysis in subsequent sections,
are relativistic corrections. The leading “kinematic” relativistic eﬀects may be obtained by
mc2 into the ideal gas
inserting the relativistic kinetic energy E(p) =
partition function (1.11). The dominant eﬀects come from the electrons, due to their small
mass. Expanding E(p) in powers of momentum, one ﬁnds that

the O(T /mec2) perturbation to the O(z2

The transverse photons also interact with the charged particles to alter the thermody-

Depending on the mass and composition of a star, the electron fugacity in stellar interiors
may be relatively small (as in the Sun), or may be large enough to completely invalidate a
quasi-classical treatment (as in white dwarfs or very massive stars). Figures 1–4 represent
an attempt to delineate the region of validity of the eﬀective theory in the temperature-
density plane for the case of a pure Z = 1 proton-electron plasma [Fig. 1], a pure Z = 2
(ionized helium) plasma [Fig. 2], a pure Z = 6 (ionized carbon) plasma [Fig. 3], and a pure
Z = 13 (ionized aluminum) plasma [Fig. 4]. The solid line shows where the second and
third order corrections in the fugacity expansion for electrons become equal in size. This
occurs before any of the individual ﬁrst, second, or third order fugacity corrections exceed
unity, and provides a convenient signal that the fugacity expansion is no longer well-behaved.
The dashed line shows where the size of eﬀective ﬁeld theory corrections to the equation of
state ﬁrst exceed unity.13 This is taken as an indication that the perturbative expansion
of the eﬀective ﬁeld theory has broken down. The eﬀective ﬁeld theory is valid only in the
region above (or to the left of) both of these lines. In Fig. 4, the temperature range extends
into the relativistic domain. The horizontal dotted line in this ﬁgure shows where the 15
T
mec2
8
relative correction to the electron pressure exceeds unity, and provides an indication of where
relativistic corrections invalidate our non-relativistic treatment.

12A recent paper [13] has attempted to argue that radiative corrections are far larger than this
relative O(αT /mec2) eﬀect. The conclusions of this paper are not correct.

13More precisely, this line shows where any of the one-, two-, or three-loop corrections ﬁrst exceed
unity. To match the earlier discussion, the non-interacting quantum statistics portion of the two-
loop correction is not included.

plasma. On the bottom axis, density denotes the total particle density (electrons plus protons)
in units of the Bohr radius, while the top axis shows the corresponding mass density. The solid
line shows where the fugacity expansion breaks down. The dashed line shows where the size of
“non-trivial” eﬀective ﬁeld theory corrections to the equation of state ﬁrst exceed unity. (See the
text for more precise descriptions.) The eﬀective ﬁeld theory is valid only in the region above both
of these lines.

For a given density (and composition), if the eﬀective ﬁeld theory is to be useful, then the
temperature must be high enough so that the perturbative expansion of the theory is valid,
but not so high so that all corrections to ideal gas behavior generated by the eﬀective theory
are too small to be relevant. In other words, the size of the eﬀects produced by the eﬀective
theory must be large enough to be interesting. Figures 5–10 show log plots of the size of
corrections to the equation of state for various compositions and two diﬀerent densities of
the plasma.
In these plots, the solid line shows the ideal gas result, including quantum
statistics for the electrons but no interactions. The long dashed line shows the one-loop
Debye screening correction, the medium dashed line shows the two-loop correction (minus
its non-interacting quantum statistics piece), and the short dashed line shows the three-loop
eﬀective ﬁeld theory correction. Plotted are the absolute values of the various corrections.
The one-loop Debye screening correction is always negative. The “cusps” pointing downward
on the two- and three-loop curves show where these corrections cross zero and change sign.
Asymptotically, for large temperature, the (non-trivial part of the) two-loop correction is
negative for Z = 1 and positive for Z
2, while the three-loop correction is asymptotically
positive in all these plots. Each plot begins at temperatures which are too low for the
eﬀective theory to be valid, includes the region where the eﬀective theory can be useful, and
ends at temperatures suﬃciently high that all corrections to ideal gas behavior are tiny.

We choose to work with the grand canonical ensemble because, as we shall see, it has a
simple functional integral representation which leads to a very convenient diagrammatic form
for perturbation theory and allows easy use of eﬀective ﬁeld theory techniques. However,
we are ultimately interested in calculating physical quantities as a function of the particle
densities, not chemical potentials, of the various species. Since the presence of interactions
between particles will modify the particle density — chemical potential relation, we will need
to compute particle densities as a function of chemical potential, and then invert this relation
(order-by-order in perturbation theory) to re-express results in terms of particle densities.
The physical particle densities, which we will denote as ¯na, satisfy charge neutrality,

as required for a sensible thermodynamic limit.

It will be useful to regard the chemical potentials as temporarily having arbitrary spatial
variation, µa(r). This extends the partition function to be a functional of these generalized
chemical potentials, Z
Z[µ], which is then the generating functional for number density
correlation functions. The free-particle number density — chemical potential relation (2.2)

Here, and henceforth, variations in βµa, and in β, will be regarded as independent. In other

correct dimensional quantity, in dimensional continuation

development unfolds. We shall also need the technique of dimensional continuation to deal
with the short-distance divergences of the classical Coulomb theory — the divergences that
are removed by quantum ﬂuctuations which we shall later handle using eﬀective ﬁeld theory
methods. Hence one might as well get accustomed to dimensional continuation at an early
stage. At the end of our computations we shall, of course, take ν

This identity holds for any choice of the generalized chemical potentials µa(r), in essence
because the average value of the electrostatic potential φ will always adjust itself to produce
a charge neutral equilibrium state.16

Saddle-points of the functional integral (2.19) correspond to solutions of the ﬁeld equation

monly called the tree approximation because the classical action is the generating functional
of connected tree graphs. In statistical mechanics it is known as the mean ﬁeld approxima-
tion. In Appendix A we shall describe the eﬀective action functional Γ[φ; µ] which is the
generalization of the classical action Scl[φ; µ] that takes account of the thermal ﬂuctuations
about the mean ﬁeld which are described by the functional integral and thus provides an ex-
act description of the plasma. As will be shown in Appendix A, the eﬀective action method
can be used to derive general properties of the plasma physics. Our work now with the
mean ﬁeld approximation will provide an introduction to the later use of the more general
eﬀective action as well as illustrating basic plasma properties.

C. Loop Expansion

The saddle-point (or “loop”) expansion of the functional integral (2.19), incorporates
corrections beyond mean ﬁeld theory and systematically generates the perturbative expan-
sion for physical quantities of interest. In the development that follows, we shall assume
that all of the desired functional derivatives with respect to the generalized, spatially vary-
ing chemical potentials which produce the insertions in the functional integral, as shown in
the previous number density (2.22) and density-density correlator (2.24), have already been
taken. Thus, we henceforth restrict our considerations to constant chemical potentials. In
the lowest-order approximation, the free-particle densities n0
a will equal the physical densities
¯na, which are charge neutral (2.10). However, perturbative corrections to the chemical po-
tential — number density relation will shift the free-particle densities away from the physical
densities, and therefore displace the true saddle point away from φ = 0. Even though the
bare neutrality constraint (2.39) no longer holds in higher orders, it will be most convenient
to expand the functional integral about φ = 0 instead of the true saddle-point value. At each
stage of this (loop) expansion, further corrections to the bare (tree approximation) charge
neutrality constraint (2.39) appear which alter the relation amongst the chemical potentials
that arises from charge neutrality. Expanding the action in powers of φ and separating the
quadratic and constant terms gives

Expanding the functional integral (2.19) in powers of ∆S will lead to Feynman diagrams in
which each line represents a factor of this Debye Green’s function times 1/β, with vertices
joining k lines representing factors of

The coincident limit of the Debye Green’s function Gν(0) will be needed in the following
sections. This is easily computed in any dimension by writing the denominator in (2.56) as
a parameter integral of an exponential, and interchanging the parameter and wave number

In other words, the dimensional regularization method automatically deletes the vacuum
self-energy contribution that comes from the pure Coulomb potential.

Although the densities of the various particle species may be obtained simply by diﬀeren-
tiating the partition function with respect to the corresponding chemical potential — which
we shall do subsequently — one may directly evaluate these densities using diagrammatic
perturbation theory. We shall do this through one-loop order to illustrate the working of the
perturbation theory and charge neutrality. In perturbation theory, the density of particles of
a given species is evaluated by expanding the exponential in (2.22) in powers of φ yielding,

In the tree approximation with φ = 0, the charge neutrality condition (2.36) requires
that the chemical potentials are arranged such that
a = 0. Thus, this sum should be
considered to start out at one-loop order. The one-legged vertex, the coeﬃcient of the term
in the interaction part of the action (2.52) linear in φ, is proportional to this sum, and hence
it also should be considered to start at one-loop order. Thus computing the expectation
value of φ to one-loop order requires expanding e−∆S in powers of φ and keeping the linear
and cubic terms. This expansion, shown in the graphs of ﬁgure 12, gives

E. Loop Expansion Parameter

We have just seen that the size of one-loop corrections is measured, in ν dimensions, by
βe2κν−2
the dimensionless parameter βe2Gν(0)
, which reduces to βe2κ0 in three dimen-
0
sions. This parameter is the essentially the ratio of the Coulomb energy for two particles
separated by a Debye screening distance to their typical kinetic energy in the plasma. Since
βe2/d3, where d is the average interparticle spacing, this expansion parameter is also
κ2
0 ∼
[ βe2/d]3/2 — the 3/2 power of the ratio of the average Coulomb energy in the plasma to the
kinetic energy in the plasma.

∼

At higher orders in the perturbative expansion, the relative contribution of any Feynman

diagram containing ℓ loops will be suppressed by [ βe2κν−2

34

[ βe2κ0]ℓ. A detailed proof of this appears in section 3 of Appendix F.19 In other words, the
loop expansion parameter is [ βe2κ0] (up to some O(1) numerical factor). In fact, we shall
ﬁnd in our explicit calculations that [βe2κ/4π] appears as the most natural loop expansion
parameter.

G. Density-Density Correlators

We now compute the density-density correlator Kab(r

panding about φ = 0, the ﬁrst non-vanishing (“tree” graph) contribution appears when ∆S
is neglected and the explicit exponentials in (2.24) are expanded to linear order, yielding

Thus, at least at tree level, there is no ﬂuctuation in the total charge of the ensemble de-
scribed by our functional integral. The usual grand canonical ensemble is modiﬁed by the
long-range Coulomb potential so that only subsectors of totally neutral particle conﬁgura-
tions appear in the sum over conﬁgurations. The general structure of the number density
correlation function described below [in particular Eq. (2.115)] shows that the vanishing of
charge ﬂuctuations (2.91) holds to all orders, and thus, in general, only neutral conﬁgura-
tions contribute to the ensemble. Finally, we note that, to lowest order, charge neutrality
also ensures that the ﬂuctuation of the total number of particles N =
aNa in the grand
canonical ensemble is Poissonian,

One-loop corrections to the density correlator are obtained by expanding both e−∆S and
the exponentials in the density operator insertions of (2.14) in powers of φ, and retaining all
next-to-leading order corrections. This leads to the one-loop contributions shown graphically
in Fig. 13. There are three classes of diagrams: those which cancel, those which simply serve
to replace bare densities by the physical densities (to one-loop order), and the rest. Diagrams
a and b cancel, as do c & d, and e & f , because their sum is proportional to
0. Here,
as well as in higher orders, all such “tadpole” diagrams can simply be neglected. That these
single-particle reducible graphs22 cancel to all orders is proven in Appendix A. Diagrams g

This limit, which follows directly from the structure (2.108) that is established in Appendix

plasma is a conductor — when an external uniform electric ﬁeld is applied to the plasma,

III. EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORY

We have just worked out the statistical mechanics of a classical, multicomponent plasma
through one-loop order. One cannot go to higher order in this purely classical theory.
Ultraviolet divergences appear at two-loop order and beyond. For example, the pressure in
two-loop order receives a contribution from the diagram

which is proportional to the integral of the cube of the Debye Green’s function,
(d3r) /r3, which is
In three-dimensions, the short-distance part of this integral behaves as
logarithmically divergent. This divergence can be seen in an elementary fashion directly
from the divergence (for opposite signed charges) of the Boltzmann-weighted integral over
(d3r) exp
the relative separation of two charges,
. Diagram (3.1) is just the
third-order term in the expansion of this integral in powers of the charges. These ultraviolet
divergences of the classical theory are tamed by quantum-mechanics — quantum ﬂuctua-
tions smear out the short distance singularities. To reproduce the eﬀects of this quantum
mechanical smearing, we must augment our previous dimensionally regulated classical the-
ory with additional local interactions which both serve to cancel the divergences present in
diagrams such as (3.1), and reproduce quantum corrections which are suppressed by powers
of ¯h (or equivalently κλ). The coeﬃcients of some of these induced interactions will diverge
in the ν
3 limit. The ﬁnite parts of these coeﬃcients (or “induced couplings”) will then
be determined by matching predictions of this eﬀective quasi-classical theory with those of
the underlying quantum mechanical theory.

A. Quantum Theory

The full (non-relativistic) many-body quantum theory generates the grand canonical
partition function — extended to be a number density generating functional ZQM[µ] by the

all states,

The integrations are now over ν < 3 spatial dimensions, since we work with the dimension-

vanishes at vanishing spatial separation [Eq. (2.17)], and so there are no inﬁnite particle
self-energies with this regularization scheme.

If the generalized chemical potentials have arbitrary variation in both space and imagi-
nary time, then ln ZQM[µ] is the generating functional for connected time-ordered correlation
functions of the density operators

(which reduces to (2.2) when ν

time-integral of the electrostatic potential.26 Consequently, it is useful to make a Fourier
series expansion of the electrostatic potential on the imaginary time interval 0 < τ < β. We
separate out the zero frequency mode by writing

n(r). The
non-zero frequency modes do not contribute to the functional integral result (3.24). Hence,
in this classical limit, the non-zero frequency modes only appear in the initial Gaussian
functional integral in Eq. (3.6), and they may be trivially integrated out. Their only eﬀect
is to change the determinantal prefactor in Eq. (3.6) from its implicit ν + 1 dimensional form
to an ν-dimensional form which just normalizes the Gaussian functional integral of the zero
modes to unity if there were no other factors. Hence, in the classical limit one ﬁnds that

This is precisely the representation (2.18) for the classical partition function derived in the

quantum partition function.

C. Induced Couplings

→

But this “derivation” of (3.29) as the classical limit of the quantum partition function
(3.6) is wrong! As emphasized earlier, the classical partition function (3.29) is singular when
ν
3, while the quantum partition function (3.6) is completely regular in 3 dimensions. It is
impossible for the classical partition function (3.29) to equal the quantum partition function
up to negligible corrections. What went wrong was the use of Eq. (3.24), which is valid for a
suﬃciently slowly varying background φ(r, τ ), inside a functional integral over ﬂuctuations in
φ — which includes ﬂuctuations on scales comparable to the typical de Broglie wavelengths
of the charged particles.
In other words, the contributions of short distance ﬂuctuations
in φ were mangled when going from the quantum partition function (3.6) to the classical
partition function (3.29). To ﬁx this error one may, in principle, integrate exactly over the
charged ﬁelds ψ(r, τ ) together with the non-zero frequency modes φn(r) of the electrostatic
potential, to produce a non-local, eﬀective action SQM[φ; µ] for the remaining zero-frequency
mode φ(r) such that

Z[µ] = N0

[dφ] e−SQM[φ;µ] .

Z

(3.30)

However, explicitly constructing or dealing with this non-local action is impossible. Our
aim is to construct a local approximation to SQM which retains those parts of the complete
non-local action which must be added to the classical theory to obtain ﬁnite, correct results
to a given order in powers of the ratio of scales κλ. To do this, the ﬁrst step is to regulate
the theory by working in ν < 3 dimensions and then add to classical action (2.20) additional
local terms, referred to as induced interactions, which both serve to ﬁx the incorrect short-

The induced interactions Sind may, in general, include arbitrary combinations of the ﬁeld

consistent with the symmetries of the original underlying theory can appear. Of particular
importance is the invariance φ
eac. The discussion of Eq. (2.30) shows
that this is an invariance of the classical theory. In view of the structure (3.7) of the quantum
Lagrangian, this shift is also an invariance of the full quantum theory. Consequently, only the

The remaining “ﬁnite” parts of these induced couplings, the non-pole terms, can only be
obtained by matching results for some physical quantity computed in this eﬀective theory
with corresponding results for the same quantity computed in the original (full quantum)
theory. The ﬁrst such matching for an induced coupling will be performed at the end of this
section. Once the required matching is done, to a given loop order, the eﬀective theory may

D. Renormalization

→

The residue of a pole in an induced coupling may be determined by calculating a suitable
n-point density correlator to a given loop order, and requiring that the result be ﬁnite as
ν
3. Once this has been done for all the couplings that appear in a given order, then
any other process will be ﬁnite to this order. In addition to the pole terms in the induced
couplings, there are, of course, ﬁnite remainders. These ﬁnite terms are determined by
matching a result computed in our eﬀective theory to the same result computed in the full
quantum theory. We shall take up the matching problem later. Here we shall exhibit the
nature of the (inﬁnite) pole terms by examining several examples.

At two-loop order, the induced coupling g0

ab contributes through the last term in (3.35)
to the irreducible part ˜Cab(k) of the density-density correlator. The only other contributions
at this order which are singular as ν

behavior of the integral is eﬀectively cut-oﬀ by the larger of the Debye wavenumber κ or
the external wave-vector k. This function is evaluated explicitly in section 2 of appendix C
[c.f. Eq. (C31)] but for our present purposes all we need is the residue of the pole in ν
3.
Since this pole arises solely from the short-distance behavior, its residue does not depend on
whether k or κ controls the long distance behavior. Using the result (C31) and neglecting
pieces that are non-singular when ν = 3 gives

As will be seen explicitly later on, it is generally very convenient to make use of this arbitrary

but arbitrary parameter µ with the dimensions of wavenumber or inverse length, a parameter
that is also used to exhibit the extra dimensions that arise when the parameters are extended
beyond ν = 3 dimensions. Thus we write the induced coupling g0

In view of the result (3.39), the ﬁrst pole term in this expression cancels the singular con-
ν (k) in Eq. (3.37). The prefactor µ2(ν−3) absorbs the variation in
tributions arising from D(3)
dimension when ν departs from ν = 3, and so the remaining ﬁnite coupling gab(µ) always
retains its ν = 3 dimensions. This ﬁnite (or “renormalized”) coupling must depend upon µ
in such a way as to ensure that the bare coupling g0
ab is independent of the arbitrary value of
µ. Thus we have deﬁned the ﬁnite coupling gab to be a scale-dependent “ﬂoating” coupling,
and we shall later exploit the renormalization group results that follow from the arbitrary
character of µ. For now, we simply note that gab(µ) will soon be determined by matching
the eﬀective theory to the underlying microscopic theory.

Similar considerations apply to the induced couplings of higher loop order. At four-loop
order, the irreducible correlator ˜Cab(k) receives contributions from the h0
ab derivative
interactions which are proportional to k2. Therefore, to determine the pole parts of these
couplings, it is suﬃcient to focus just on those contributions to ˜Cab(k) (at four-loop order)
which are also proportional to k2 and singular as ν
[There are additional singular
contributions to ˜Cab(k) at four-loop order which are proportional to κ2. The renormaliza-

E. Matching

a n0

The most direct approach to determine the ﬁnite part of the two-loop coupling g0

ab given
in Eq. (3.41) is to compare the density-density correlator ˜Kab(k) in the eﬀective theory
and the original quantum theory. Because the induced coupling g0
ab makes a contribution
to ˜Cab(k) (and hence to the full correlator ˜Kab(k)) proportional to n0
b, it is suﬃcient to
retain in both the eﬀective and fundamental theories only those contributions with the same
a n0
n0
b dependence on the bare densities. Since it is the short-distance contributions which
must be correctly matched, Debye screening may be completely ignored [3] if one compares
the correlator evaluated at a non-zero wave number k. Consequently, to determine the
two-loop coupling g0
ab it is suﬃcient to work just to second order in the fugacity expansion.
And because the induced coupling g0
ab makes a momentum-independent contribution to the
λ−1 and
correlator (3.37), it is also suﬃcient to work in the limit of small momentum k
neglect all contributions which vanish as k

0.30
The tree and one-loop contributions to the correlator are given by Eqs. (2.102) and
(2.106)–(2.108). Two-loop contributions to ˜Kab(k) which are proportional to n0
b arise
in two ways. The one-particle irreducible part ˜Cab(k) receives such a contribution from
the ﬁrst term in (3.37). In addition, there is a one-particle reducible contribution arising
from the two-loop h0
a interaction appearing in Eq. (3.32). This may be seen as follows.

a n0

≪

→

29There are also “contact” terms proportional to δab, δbc or δac, analogous to the second term
appearing in (3.37). However, the required pole terms in g0
abc may be entirely inferred from the
non-contact terms in ˜Kabc(k, q) which are proportional to n0
c. The resulting value of g0
abc
necessarily also renders the contact terms ﬁnite, just as seen explicitly at two-loop order in (3.37).

We write the corresponding result in the underlying quantum theory as the Fourier

transform of the density-density correlator33

33We are glossing over a subtlety here, for Eq. (3.59) involves the equal time expectation value
na(r1, 0) nb(r2, 0)
iβ, whereas our desired correlator is the zero-frequency correlation function
h
(3.10). The diﬀerence between these two is just the sum of correlations at all non-zero Matsubara
frequencies ωn. However, as discussed at the end of this section, non-zero frequency correlators
are proportional to k2 (due to current-conservation), and hence do not aﬀect the matching for the
g0
ab interaction in the eﬀective classical theory, which may be extracted from the k
0 behavior
of the density-density correlator.

b (or equivalently

just produces the spin degeneracies ga and gb. Hence, reverting to the previous notation in

34As it stands, this contact term is infrared divergent since Debye screening, which involves an
arbitrary number of particles, is needed to provide the long-distance cut oﬀ which makes the contact
term infrared ﬁnite. It is precisely because the required value of the induced coupling gab can be
deduced solely from the non-contact part of the correlator that it is permissible to ignore Debye
screening in this matching calculation and just use a fugacity expansion.

Note that this limit does not involve Planck’s constant ¯h: The argument of the logarithm

Eq. (3.76), the ﬁrst correction to this classical limit is of order ¯h2. On the other hand, in the
limit of strong attraction, ηab → −∞
, the exponential blow-up exhibited in Eq. (3.77) shows
that our perturbative development breaks down, as it must, since in this limit the ionized
plasma must condense into neutral atoms. This is, of course, a highly quantum-mechanical
regime. Finally, for small ηab, the exchange term (3.79) dominates and, with λaa = √2λa,

Noting that this multiplies (n0

of the particle’s charge. Indeed, we shall shortly see in the following Sec. IV that this is
just the usual free particle exchange correction that is quadratic in the fugacity. The next
aa in the exchange contribution ˜f (ηaa) gives the familiar order e2 exchange
term of order η−2
correction to the plasma.

With the single two-loop coupling g0

ab completely determined by Eqs. (3.41) and (3.81),
one may now use the quasi-classical eﬀective theory to compute thermodynamics, or other
quantities of interest, to two or three loop order. Before four-loop calculations of physical
abc, h0
quantities can be performed, the undetermined scales in the four loop couplings g0

and k0
ab would need to be determined by an analogous higher order matching calculation.
This we have not attempted to do.

F. Non-zero Frequency Modes

(3.87)

characterize quantum ﬂuctuations in the electrostatic potential. They decouple from the
zero-frequency degrees of freedom and could be trivially integrated out in the leading-order
classical limit. But in higher orders, this is no longer true. To examine the eﬀects which
result from non-zero frequency ﬂuctuations, we return to the full quantum theory whose
functional integral representation (3.6) may be rewritten as

The zero-frequency parts which appear here have already been included in the eﬀective
theory. These are precisely the classical eieaβφ interaction, plus the ﬁrst derivative interaction
φ(r)]2. Because of the presence of the exponential factor
in (3.32) involving h0
a [
eieaβφ(r), the third term in (3.91) generates a coupling between the non-zero frequency modes
of φ and the static mode.

µa(r)+iea∇

∇

The expansion (3.91) is valid if the potential φ(r, τ ) varies slowly on the scale of the
thermal wavelength λa. As discussed earlier, inserting this expansion (truncated to two
derivative terms) into the functional integral (3.89) completely mangles the eﬀects of short-
distance ﬂuctuations in φ. However, as with any eﬀective ﬁeld theory, the resulting errors
are compensated, to any given order in κλ, by including the requisite induced interactions
and suitably adjusting their coeﬃcients.

At this point, one may contemplate completely integrating out the non-zero frequency
modes of φ in order to generate an eﬀective theory containing only the static potential φ(r).
But doing so would be a mistake. Integrating out the non-zero frequency modes is no longer
trivial because of the coupling between the static and non-zero frequency modes. More im-
portantly, the resulting functional of φ(r) could not be adequately approximated by any set
of local interactions. Correlations of the non-zero frequency components of φ only decrease
like 1/r (due to the long-range nature of Coulomb interactions), and are not Debye screened.
This will be demonstrated below. In physical terms, the absence of Debye screening in the
potential correlations at non-zero (Matsubara) frequencies reﬂects the eﬀect of inertia on
the response of charges in the plasma. Consequently, if one completely integrates out the

62

non-zero frequency components of φ, then the resulting theory will contain complicated
non-local interactions which decrease only algebraically with distance. To produce a useful
eﬀective theory, that can be approximated by local interactions, one must explicitly retain
in the eﬀective theory all degrees of freedom with long distance correlations—including the
non-zero frequency components of φ. In other words, the complete eﬀective theory must
have the form

Because the sub-leading interaction in (3.93) involves the square of the gradient φm(r), and
not φm(r) itself, this interaction does not cause non-zero frequency correlations to develop
a ﬁnite correlation length. Rather, it merely produces an O [(κλ)2] change in the residue
of the 1/k2 pole of ˜
Gm(k). Recalling that ωm = 2πm/β (which has units of energy in our

37This is completely analogous to Goldstone’s theorem proving the presence of long range ﬂuctua-
tions in any theory with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. Since the symmetry (3.99)
shifts φm, it is impossible for the expectation values
to be invariant under this symmetry.
Consequently, φm must have long range correlations.

38This identity would not hold if we had chosen to employ a diﬀerent regularization scheme, such
as a momentum cutoﬀ, in deﬁning the eﬀective theory. Had we done so, it would be necessary
a eiβeaφ interaction in order to compensate for cutoﬀ-
to adjust the coeﬃcient of the classical n0
dependent eﬀects resulting from ﬂuctuations of the non-zero frequency modes.

FIG. 14. First non-vanishing correction to ln Z involving the non-zero frequency modes of
φ(r, τ ). The dashed lines represent the long-range, unscreened Coulomb Green’s functions of the
non-zero frequency modes. Each vertex represents one insertion of Snon−static (speciﬁcally that
part which is linear in the static mode φ(r)). The relative size of the resulting contribution
is O[(λκ)4(βe2κ)2], since each vertex contains an overall factor of λ2, and the two loops of the
diagram generate two powers of the loop expansion parameter βe2κ. Because we are treating the
quantum parameters βe2
a/λa as ﬁxed numbers of order one, the net result is a contribution of
six-loop order.

illustrated in Fig. 14. However, even though the non-zero frequency interactions are sup-
pressed by numerous powers of κλ, they fundamentally alter the long-distance behavior of
the static density-density correlator. Instead of exhibiting classical Debye-screened expo-
nential decay, the correlator acquires a long-distance tail which decreases only algebraically
with distance. This happens at ﬁve-loop order as shown in section VII, where a simple but
explicit evaluation of the resulting long-distance limit is given.

FIG. 16. Two-loop diagrams contributing to the irreducible part ˜Cab(k) of the density-density
correlator. The arrows merely serve to indicate where external momentum ﬂows in and out of each
diagram; the vertices where momentum ﬂows in and out should be regarded as having attached
species labels a and b, respectively. The circled ‘X’ in diagram l denotes the contribution from the
two-loop interactions proportional to either g0
ab or h0
a. Diagrams a–d are two loop contributions
naiβ. These terms, together with part of diagram l, simply provide the
to the contact term δab h
naiβ. Not shown are reﬂected versions of diagrams
two-loop correction to the number density
h
e and h which diﬀer only by an interchange of incoming and outgoing vertices. Diagram e and
its reﬂection are one-loop corrections to the densities that appear in the vertex factors in the
one-loop result for ˜Cab(k). Diagram f is a one-loop density correction to the Debye wave number
in the Debye Green’s function appearing in the one-loop ˜Cab(k). Thus, the eﬀect of diagrams a
through f (plus a part of l) is merely to put the correct physical densities, to two-loop order,
in the previous one-loop ˜Cab(k). Only diagrams g through k (plus the remaining part of l) give
non-trivial, two-loop corrections to ˜Cab(k).

Therefore Σf accounts for the correction to the one-loop ˜F (1)
ab (k) brought about by replacing
the bare Debye wavenumber κ0 by its one-loop corrected value. In summary, the two-loop
terms Σa through Σf , plus the second piece of Σl, just provide simple density corrections to
the one-loop ˜C (1)
ab (k), and all of these terms may be omitted if the correct physical densities
¯na are used in the construction of ˜C (1)

ab (k).

To assemble the remaining terms in the two-loop, irreducible correlator, we ﬁrst use the

To check this result, we note that, as is shown in Eq. (A68) of Appendix A, there is a simpler
way to obtain the same result, namely:

where the partial derivatives are to be computed at ﬁxed β. It is a straight forward matter
to take the βµb derivative of the two-loop result (4.10) for the density
naiβ and conﬁrm
[via Eq. (4.27)] that the result (4.37) is indeed correct.

V. THREE-LOOP THERMODYNAMICS

There are nine diagrams, shown in ﬁgure 17, which contribute to ln Z (or equivalently
3 and may be computed

the pressure) at three-loop order. Diagrams a–f are ﬁnite as ν
directly in 3 dimensions. The explicit contributions of these diagrams to (ln Z)/

deﬁned in Eq’s. (4.23)–(4.25). These integrals are evaluated in appendix C 2 (with help
from Ref. [14]. Once again, the ﬁnal contribution Γi involving the single two-loop coupling
g0
ab removes the short-distance singularities in both the three-loop graphs Γg and Γh that
diverge in three dimensions. Note that this cancelation of divergences involves the detailed
structure of the induced coupling interaction with its exponential dependence upon the
potential φ. As discussed earlier, the basic (“primitive”) divergences which the induced
couplings must cancel appear only in even loop order. The subsidiary divergences at this
three-loop order are canceled by the non-trivial potential dependence of the two-loop induced
coupling. Inserting the explicit results for these integrals produces the physical ν
3 limit
of ln Z to three loop order:

41As noted just below, a completely explicit result for the Helmholtz free energy has been available
in the literature since the mid-1980’s, and the pressure is related to the Helmholtz free energy by the
easy-to-apply thermodynamic identity, p =
V|T,N . Despite the appearance of several more
∂F/∂
recent papers reporting results for the pressure [6–9], we are unaware of any existing publication
which contains the complete, explicit three-loop expression (5.15).

It is easy to check that the three loop terms in the equation of state (5.15) and the Helmholtz
free energy (5.17) are in agreement with the corrections produced by this redeﬁnition. It is worth
noting that the eﬀect of the h0

the bare densities n0
a is not produced by the change given above. The ﬁeld redeﬁnition changes the
dependence of the partition function on the bare densities, and also changes the relation between
physical and bare densities. However, when these modiﬁed results are re-expressed in terms of the
physical densities, the same physical equation of state emerges, as it must.

This result agrees with the corresponding result in Alastuey and Perez [6],43 and it agrees for
the most part and except for some small misprints with the result to be found in Ref. [5].44

43 In particular, we agree with the result for the Helmholtz free energy given in Eq. (7.3) of
Ref. [6]. Their result involves two constants, also called C1 and C2. The relations between their

C1,AP = 15.2021, to be compared with their value 15.201

end of their equation, which reads 0(n3 ln n) in our notation, is wrong. Our next section examines
the nature of the leading logarithmic terms to all orders. In particular, we show that the density
dependence of the next (four loop) correction is given by O(n3 ln2 n).

n/2. For

B. One-Component Plasma

Another special case is the “jellium” model, in which a single charged particle species
moves in the presence of a neutralizing, uniform background charge density. This is the one-
component plasma (OCP) which is much discussed in the literature. It may be obtained by
taking a limit of a plasma containing two species: one of charge e, number density n, and
n/z, and
mass m; the other ‘spectator’ species of charge eB ≡ −
mass mB, with z
0. The charge of each spectator particle becomes vanishingly small, but
their density diverges, so as to preserve total charge neutrality. The net result (for static
equilibrium properties) is that the spectator particles act like an smooth inert background
charge density. The ideal gas pressure of the spectator particles diverges as z
0, and
must be subtracted from the total pressure before sending z to zero. If the background,
spectator particles are not taken to have a very large mass, mB → ∞
, then they will also
make quantum, exchange contributions to the pressure. To the three-loop order to which
we compute, these unwanted exchange contributions, in the z

ze, number density nB ≡

0 limit, are given by

Here κ = (nβe2)1/2 is the Debye wavelength due to the single charge species. Once again,
we have written the result in terms of ascending powers of the dimensionless parameter
g = βe2κ/(4π) which characterizes the strength of Coulomb interactions in the plasma. On
the other hand, our result entails no restriction on the size of the quantum parameter

An often treated special case of the one-component plasma is its classical limit. As
already alluded to in footnotes 6 and 36, in this limit the Boltzmann factor with the repul-
sive potential provides damping at the Coulomb distance dC = βe2/4π, and the quantum-
mechanical ﬂuctuations are not required to obtain a ﬁnite theory. (And, moreover, dC is
the correct, physical cutoﬀ if dC > λe.) The ¯h

To obtain an independent check on this result, the order ¯h2 quantum correction for the
canonical partition function of the classical one-component plasma is independently derived
in Appendix E. There it is shown that there are no ¯h2 corrections in three and higher loop
orders — in agreement with the lack of an ¯h2 correction to the order g3 term here — while
the two-loop ¯h2 correction given in Eq. (E22) of that Appendix agrees exactly with that in
the g2 term in Eq. (5.29), the term involving 1/η2
ee.

Riemann, Schlanges, DeWitt, and Kraeft [7] report an equation of state for a one-
component plasma. The terms in their formula which we classify as being of tree, one-,
and two-loop order — the terms of order g0, g1, and g2 which appear in the ﬁrst line of
Eq. (5.25) — agree precisely with our result. They do not, however, present all the terms of
three-loop, g3 order, but rather only include terms “up to the order (ne2)5/2”. We note that
such a statement has only a formal signiﬁcance since ne2 bears dimensions, and hence there
is no physical signiﬁcance in assuming that it is small. The terms retained by Riemann et
al. are only those parts of the three-loop results which involve leading inverse powers of the
quantum parameter ηee, explicitly

Here, ge = 2 is the spin degeneracy of the electron, and we have chosen to separate the

altogether agree with formula (23) given by Riemann et al. [7] in that our exchange term of
order g3/η3
ee = O(e3) is a factor 1/2 than theirs. The earlier paper by DeWitt, Schlanges,
Sakakura, and Kraeft [8] contains, in its Eq. (15), the same three-loop contributions, with
the same discrepancies. Their two-loop terms are correct as far as they go, but in this paper
the two-loop terms also stop at the formal order of (ne2)5/2 rather than containing the full
dependence on βe2/λ as in the later paper. Recently, we received an unpublished erratum
from J. Riemann in which the coeﬃcient of the O(g3/η3
ee) exchange term is corrected by a
factor of two, and now all results are in agreement.

VI. HIGHER ORDERS AND THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP

A. Renormalization Group Equations and Leading Logs

In section III D we introduced an arbitrary scale µ in order to separate induced couplings
into pole terms and “renormalized” ﬁnite contributions. For the ﬁrst induced coupling this
amounted to writing

However, since the theory in general, and the bare coupling g0
about the arbitrary value of the scale µ, we must have dg0

ab in particular, knows nothing

ab/dµ = 0. This requires that

It is only the integration constants, which we have expressed as µ2

In other words, the form of the renormalized (or “running”) coupling gab(µ) is completely
dictated by the pole terms, which in turn depend only on the form of the eﬀective the-
ab, that must be
ory.
determined by matching the eﬀective theory to the underlying quantum theory. The wave
numbers µab provide the quantum damping or cutoﬀ to the classical theory and hence must
be proportional to inverse thermal wave lengths. The result of the matching (6.3) shows
that

as shown in Eqs. (4.1), (4.4) and (4.6). The renormalization group equation (6.2) ensures
that the sum (6.7) does not depend upon the arbitrary scale µ. It is, however, convenient to
choose µ2 = κ2/4π, for then the entire logarithmic term in ln Z (2) comes from the induced
ln(λ2κ2/4π), rather than from the two-loop graph (6.6).45 Thus, the

The virtue of this simple observation is that it easily generalizes to higher orders, and

symmetrical in the indices abc, has the dimensions of µ4(ν−3) times 12 powers of charges,

It is a simple matter to verify that the double pole divergences in Eq’s. (6.17) and (6.19)
are indeed canceled by the contribution (6.15) to the g0

abc coupling term.

The renormalization group equation for the ﬁnite coupling gabc(µ) may now be obtained
abc/dµ

abc/dµ = 0. Since the single pole terms in d g0

by returning to the condition that d g0
have been shown to cancel, this condition reduces to

47An outline of the proof is as follows. Choose the left-hand 5-point vertex in (6.18) to be
the origin. Assign the upper 4-point vertex the coordinate r1, and the lower 3-point vertex the
coordinate r2. The double pole contribution comes from the most singular integration region where
κ−1. In computing the leading contribution from this region, the right-hand line
r1| ≪ |
|
running between r2 and r1 can be replaced by a line that runs between r2 and the origin. Thus, as
far as the leading singularity is concerned, the graph reduces to the graph (6.16) except that the
condition
must be imposed. Since the graph (6.16) is symmetrical under the interchange
of these two coordinates, imposing this condition merely multiplies the result by 1/2.

Recalling that the divergent terms in the classical theory have all their non-integral
dimensional dependence appearing as integer powers of κν−3, we see that, just as in the
previous two-loop discussion, choosing µ2 = κ2/4π in the induced couplings not only removes
the poles in these classical loop graphs, it also prevents the appearance of any additional large
logarithms in the resulting ﬁnite contributions of four-loop graphs. Thus taking µ2 = κ2/4π
and inserting (6.22) into (6.11) immediately yields the leading logarithmic contribution to

The key point is that when µ2 is chosen to be of order κ2, the only source of large logarithms
are the induced couplings themselves; the rank-k renormalized coupling ga1···ak is of order48

contribution is O[(βe2κ)2p lnp(λκ)] in magnitude.49

The leading-log contributions at odd-loop orders are also easily determined. When the
scale µ is O(κ), so that the only source of large logarithms are the induced couplings them-
selves, the largest number of logarithms at a given odd loop order will result from diagrams

48This has been shown explicitly for k = 2 and 3. The current section may be regarded as an
inductive proof of this assertion to all orders.

49The alert reader will have noticed that we have ignored the induced couplings for derivative
interactions, h0
ab in the
induced action (3.32) give rise to only a single log at four loop order, not a double log, and so it
does not contribute to the leading log result. Moreover, just as in the previous case of the ga1···ap
couplings, these two-derivative couplings generate a sequence of higher powers of logs, but each
member in this sequence of contributions is suppressed by one power of ln κλ compared to the
corresponding leading-log contribution. In the same manner, the four-derivative or higher terms
schematically denoted by the ellipsis

in Eq. (3.32) give rise to still further subdominant logs.

FIG. 18. Leading-log contributions to ln Z at odd-loop order. Circled vertices labeled k de-
a1···ak+1. For order 2p + 1

note the insertion of the rank-k induced interaction proportional to g0
contributions, the ranks of all the insertions around the loop must sum to p.

where the maximal number of induced couplings are inserted into a graph with only one
explicit loop. At loop order of 2p + 1, this means a single insertion of the rank p induced
coupling, or two insertions of rank k and rank p
k couplings, or more generally, the insertion
of any collection of induced couplings whose ranks total p, as illustrated in ﬁgure 18. Rather
than following the cookbook method and struggling to get the proper combinatorial factors
to evaluate these diagrams, it is much easier to simply return to the original functional
integral representation (3.30). The sum of the graphs in question just corresponds to the
contribution of the order φ(r)2 terms in the ﬁrst line of the induced interaction (3.32) to the

Note that for even-loop orders these leading-logarithmic contributions always include a sum
of particle densities weighted by an odd power of the charge. Consequently, the leading-
logarithmic contributions at even-loop order vanish in the special case of a neutral symmetric
binary plasma, such as a pure electron-proton plasma, where the charges of the two species
are equal and opposite and the the physical densities are necessarily equal due to charge
neutrality. This is a general result, which follows from the recursive structure of (6.31) and
the vanishing of its initial term.

deﬁnes an average density n which is the geometric mean of the bare densities n0
a and thus
entails β−3/2 times the exponential of the average of the chemical potentials, then one may
alternatively express a speciﬁc density in terms of the average density and a relative density
ratio xa,

The charges of each species may similarly be written in terms of some mean charge e and a
relative charge ratio ya,

ea ≡

Any dependence on the thermal wavelength λa may be re-expressed as dependence on the

will equal (βe2κ0)n times some function of the dimensionless variables

This is a precise version of the statement that the loop expansion parameter (in the physical
limit of three dimensions) is βe2κ0. The point to be emphasized is that the parameter βe2κ0
captures the overall powers of the inverse temperature, charge, and densities that appear
in a given loop order. Therefore, the grand canonical partition function has the functional

The non-vanishing of A arises from the ‘anomalous’ dependence on the underlying quantum
physics. This behavior shows that A is akin to the anomalies encountered in relativistic
quantum ﬁeld theories.

To ﬁnd an expression for the anomaly A, which may be evaluated without separately
computing the pressure, internal energy, and densities, we turn to the functional integral
representation of the grand canonical partition function. It proves convenient for this speciﬁc
application to use a scaled potential ˜φ(r) = βφ(r) so that the interaction terms now involve

For the terms in Sint which do not involve derivatives, the introduction of generalized coor-

To eﬀect a dilation or scale change, we take

gkl = e2σδkl .

In view of the distance interval (6.64), this has the eﬀect of the length alteration L
With this metric, the determinantal factor and inverse metric are simply

FIG. 19. Correction to the irreducible density-density correlator Cab generated by the induced
interaction Snon−static involving the non-zero frequency modes of φ(r, τ ). The dashed lines represent
the long-range, unscreened Coulomb Green’s functions of the non-zero frequency modes.

VII. LONG DISTANCE CORRELATIONS

As noted in section III, the interaction (3.93) which couples the static and non-zero
frequency modes of the electrostatic potential only aﬀects thermodynamic quantities at six-
loop order. However, this term does generate some qualitatively new eﬀects in correlation
functions. In particular, it destroys the exponential screening of the quasi-classical theory
[10–12]. This eﬀect is easy to calculate using the eﬀective theory as given in Eq’s. (3.92)
and (3.93).

−

We will ﬁrst examine the workings of this eﬀect on the single-particle irreducible part
r′) of the number density correlation function. The graph of Fig. 19 is produced if
Cab(r
each of the variational derivatives in the deﬁnition (3.35) of the number density correlator act
on Snon−static in the functional integral (3.92). The non-zero-frequency potentials that this
brings down from the exponential become tied together into the product of two unscreened,
long-ranged Coulomb Green’s functions. Since the result is single-particle irreducible, it
deﬁnes an O [(βe2κ)(κλ)4] correction to Cab(r
r′).50 Explicitly, the calculation that we
have just described gives the long-ranged contribution

APPENDIX A: FUNCTIONAL METHODS

In this Appendix, we deﬁne, in the context of our plasma theory, the generating function
of connected correlation functions and its Legendre transform, the eﬀective action.52 We
review relevant properties of these functionals that are well known in quantum ﬁeld theory,
and then describe how number densities and density–density correlation functions are related
to them.
In particular, we show how the density-density correlator may be expressed in
terms of a “single-particle irreducible” function in a way that explicitly exhibits its structure,
particularly its small wave-number behavior. We also show how the mean-square ﬂuctuations
in energy, and particle numbers, may be expressed in terms of the same single-particle
irreducible functions. This formalism is applied to compute the number densities, density–
density correlators, and equation of state to two loop order in an particularly eﬃcient manner
in a ﬁnal appendix so as to illustrate methods complimentary to those employed in the text.
The partition function of our theory, in either its original quantum form (3.6), or re-

expressed as an eﬀective theory (3.92), has a functional integral representation

1. Connected Generating Functional

The addition of an external charge density or source σ(x) coupled to the ﬁeld φ(x) deﬁnes
a functional W [σ; µ] which is the generating functional for connected φ ﬁeld correlation
functions — correlators whose graphical representations have no disconnected parts. The
deﬁnition is

[dφ] exp

S[φ; µ] +

The insertion in the functional integrand of the functional derivative of

an overall factor of eW [σ;µ]. Thus the properly normalized particle number density of species
a is given by

This is the number density in the presence of both spatially (or temporally) varying chemical

potentials µb(x) and the external charge density σ(x). With the chemical potentials
taken to be constants and σ taken to vanish, Eq. (A9) reduces to the constant number
density ¯na =

a subscript 0. Thus,

2. Eﬀective Action

The eﬀective action functional Γ[ ¯φ; µ] is deﬁned by a Legendre transform of the generating
functional W [σ; µ]. It generalizes the mean ﬁeld theory described in Sec. II B to include
the eﬀects of thermal and quantum ﬂuctuations. The eﬀective action functional has two
important properties: Not only does it contain only connected graphs (as does W ), it
contains no single-particle reducible graphs — graphs which can be cut into two disjoint
pieces by cutting a single line. This is shown explicitly to two-loop order in Appendix G 2
below. This property simpliﬁes calculations. For example, when Γ is used to compute the
free energy, one can simply delete all “tadpole” graphs. Moreover, as we shall see, the use
of the eﬀective action together with the functional relations that we are developing reveals
the basic structure of the theory in a very useful form. The eﬀective action functional is
obtained by setting

φ(x)

σ

β = ¯φ(x) ,

h

i

that is, by considering the ﬁeld expectation value rather than the source to be the indepen-
dent variable. The eﬀective action is then deﬁned by the Legendre transformation

Γ[ ¯φ; µ]

Thus we may consider Γ to be a functional of the independent variables ¯φ(x), µa(x), and β,
with the (partial) functional derivatives

and the ordinary partial derivative

In view of Eq. (A23), evaluating the eﬀective action at a stationary point, a point where
δΓ/δ ¯φ = 0, is the same as setting the source σ to zero. With constant chemical potentials
and a vanishing source, the last equalities reduce to the ordinary number density and internal
energy. As remarked in the text, the grand canonical partition function is related to the
grand potential by Z = exp
, and so the grand potential is given by the eﬀective
action evaluated at its stationary point in the limit of constant chemical potentials,

To uncover the structure of the potential correlation function, we ﬁrst write the ﬁeld

The structure of the potential correlation function is intimately connected to that of the
number density correlation function. Hence it is useful to examine the relationship between
the eﬀective action and the number density correlator. Recalling the expression (A14) for
this function in terms of W [σ; µ] and then the fact [Eq. (A9)] that one functional derivative
deﬁnes the number density, we see that we may write

Since the function ˜Cab(k, ωm) is a double variational derivative of the eﬀective action func-
tional Γ[ ¯φ; µa], it is single-particle irreducible. On the other hand, ˜
(k, ωm), the potential

correlation function, is not single-particle irreducible.

We have yet to express the number density and potential correlation functions in the
simplest terms. To do so, we return to the expectation of the ﬁeld equation (A19). With
µa and σ taken to be independent variables, the functional derivative of this equation with
respect to a generalized chemical potential, with the chemical potentials then set constant
and the source to zero, gives

3. Eﬀective Potential, Thermodynamic Quantities

In quantum ﬁeld theory, the eﬀective potential (times the space-time volume) is deﬁned
to be the restriction of the eﬀective action to spatially (and temporally) uniform ﬁelds. We
have already remarked that the further restriction to the stationary point yields the grand
potential (times β). With constant chemical potentials, the stationarity condition δΓ/δ ¯φ = 0

106

is just the condition that charge neutrality hold for a given value of ¯φ. For convenience, we
will assume that physical chemical potentials are chosen such that this stationary point lies
at ¯φ = 0, so that

.

βΩ = Γ[ ¯φ; µ]
¯φ=0
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
This is the function that we have computed to three loops. However, the charge neutrality
(cid:12)
constraint is never used in our computations, and so, in fact, the function Γ[ ¯φ=0; µ] has
been calculated for arbitrary (constant) chemical potentials µa. This extension of the grand
potential is needed for the computation of thermodynamic average numbers and energy
and for the correlators of these quantities. Just as in our previous work, to derive general
relationships it is convenient temporarily to work with Γ[ ¯φ; µ] for arbitrary constant ¯φ and
µa. The results of these derivations, however, will depend only upon the ¯φ = 0 functions
that have been computed.

(A60)

With uniform ﬁelds, Eq. (A23) reduces to

∂Γ( ¯φ; µ)
∂ ¯φ

= σβ

.

V

As we have remarked before, the restriction to a vanishing source, σ = 0, determines

¯φ = ¯φ(β,

βµa}
and inserting this value of ¯φ in Γ yields the physical grand potential βΩ. With arbitrary
chemical potentials, ¯φ is non-vanishing so as to keep a zero charge density in the plasma.
The previous expressions (A24) and (A25), evaluated with ¯φ at the stationary point (A62),
gives the physical particle numbers and energy,

To obtain relations for the ﬂuctuations of these quantities, we ﬁrst need two results. The
derivative of Eq. (A61) with respect to the inverse temperature keeping σ = 0 so that ¯φ is
determined by Eq. (A62) gives, just as in the previous analogous calculation of the chemical
potential functional derivative (A42),

correlation function, the zero frequency part of the general correlator, describes a Debye
screened potential (except for the very long-distance tail elucidated in section VII), the
non-zero frequency parts of this correlation function are not Debye screened. Recalling the

The integration measures of the charged ﬁeld functional integrals are unchanged by the
phase rotation (A90). Hence the connected generating functional W [A] is invariant under
the gauge transformation (A91). This invariance carries over to the eﬀective action Γ[A]
since the Legendre transformation which relates it to W [A] involves only neutral ﬁelds that
are not altered by the phase rotation or gauge transformation. In the limit of an inﬁnitesimal
transformation, the gauge invariance gives functional diﬀerential statements

appear a bit odd since ˜Cab(k, ωm) is equal to an analytic function of ω, Fab(k2, ω), evaluated
at discrete points on the imaginary axis,55 ω = iωm = i2πm/β. Thus one might expect a
uniform behavior in ω which would require that ˜Cab(k, 0) = O(k2) for small k2 and no Debye
screening. In fact, the behavior of the analytic function Fab(k2, ω) is not uniform in k2 when
ω is small. This non-uniform behavior is illustrated by the simple one-loop contribution
of the charged ﬁelds to ˜Cab(k, ωm). To further simplify the result, we also take the ¯h

generate number density correlation functions, its spatially varying part will be implicitly
included in the potential V . The ﬁeld ψ(r, τ ) is either periodic (for Bosons) or antiperiodic
(for Fermions) in τ with period β. The external potential V (r, τ ) is initially deﬁned in the
interval 0 < τ < β, but may be extended to all real τ by regarding it as a periodic function
with period β. The functional integral produces an inverse determinant in the Bose case
and a determinant in the Fermi case,

In this appendix, we shall show how the determinant Z[V ] is related to a sum of ordinary,
single-particle quantum-mechanical amplitudes. We shall then make use of this result to
derive approximate evaluations of Z[V ] that become valid in the limit in which the dy-
namics may be treated classically, approximations that are used in the calculations of the
text. These needed results could perhaps be obtained more quickly with other methods,
but the development given here hopefully illuminates the character of the theory and the
intermediate results that are obtained may be useful in other contexts.

The determinant can be constructed by integrating its variation. The familiar form for

the variation of the determinant gives

Here the functional integral is over all paths that begin and end at position r, r(0) = r =

. In other words, the integral
is over all paths which are periodic with period nβ¯h. In the limit in which the quantum-
mechanical aspects of the particle’s dynamics is not important, the classical limit for the
dynamics which is equivalent to the large mass m limit, the dominant path is just the

The remaining path integral (B27) describes free-particle motion (in imaginary time) be-

itly, we write the path r(τ ) as a constant mean position r plus a deviation whose integral

over the interval (0, nβ) vanishes. The integration measure factors into an ordinary integral
over the mean position (dνr) and a constrained measure [dr]′ which denotes integration over
the space of periodic functions with vanishing mean. The integration over the mean position
produces a delta-function,

To illustrate the working of our results and to make contact with more familiar forms, we
examine the two-point, charge density – charge density correlation function. This function
is given by the double functional derivative of Eq. (B37) with respect to ˜V with ˜V then
taken to vanish, the result summed over n as in Eq. (B18), and multiplied by the square of
the charge of the particle which we denote simply as e2. We also take the Fourier transform
in the imaginary time as well as space. In view of the time-translation invariance of the
result, this Fourier transform is given by one imaginary time integral over the interval 0, nβ
while the other imaginary time integral just provides a factor of nβ,
with a factor exp
with the factor of β removed by the Fourier transform conventional normalization. Thus
the correlation function is given by

takes λ2

this limit may be obtained by expanding the exact result (B37) to ﬁrst order in λ2. Although
this is easily done for an arbitrary term n in the fugacity expansion zn, we shall need only
the n = 1 result corresponding to the classical limit of Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. Hence
we now restrict the discussion to n = 1 and write f1(τ ) = f (τ ) as before. For a term which

The three-dimensional q integral can be readily evaluated using spherical coordinates. Since
the radial integral is even in q, it may be extended to run over
if it is

contour integration. A little algebra puts the result in the form

APPENDIX D: QUANTUM COULOMB SU (1, 1) SYMMETRY EXPLOITED

As discussed in the text, the ultraviolet divergences of classical two-loop order quantities
are tamed by quantum ﬂuctuations. The value of the ﬁrst induced coupling which must
be added to the classical theory can be inferred from the computation of the quantum-
mechanical, two-particle, ﬁnite-temperature correlation function. With the center-of-mass
motion factored out as done in the text [Eq. (3.67)], the Fourier transform of the direct
contribution to the relative motion correlation for particle species a, b reads

mab = m and eaeb/4π = e2 so that the Hamiltonian reads

Placing the factor of e−ik·r inside the matrix element in Eq. (D1) and treating the coordinate
r as an operator allows one to express the correlation function as a quantum-mechanical
trace,

For the exchange contribution (D2), we may write

The evaluation of F−(k) closely parallels that of F+(k). To keep the presentation as simple as
possible we will focus on F+(k), and then summarize the analogous results for the exchange
contribution F−(k) at the end of this appendix.

It proves convenient to write the correlation function F+(k) as a contour integral involv-

where the contour C, shown in Fig. 20, wraps clockwise about the cut along the positive real

real and suﬃciently negative so that E lies to the left of all singularities, and only later
analytically continue to energies lying on the contour C. Thus at ﬁrst we write

59This is slightly cavalier. Although the trace deﬁning F+(k) in (D6) is well-deﬁned, the corre-
sponding trace in (D8) has a high-energy divergence in two or more dimensions. This divergence,
which merely reﬂects the growth of the density of states at high energy, is independent of the
charge e2. Therefore, we should really subtract the e2
0 limit inside the trace deﬁning G(k, E)

+(k) = λ−3
ab (2π)3 δ(k) is the e2 = 0 limit, so that the

notation as simple as possible, we will not indicate this subtraction explicitly.

60This su(1, 1) symmetry is a subgroup of a larger so(4, 2) “dynamical” symmetry of the hydro-
gen which was noted many years ago by Barut, Fronsdal, Nambu, and others [17]. The explicit
construction used here of the generators in terms of canonical variables was, to our knowledge, ﬁrst
done by one of the authors (LSB) and G. J. Maclay and appears in the latter’s Ph.D. dissertation
[18]. Although we know of no other references, this construction may well appear elsewhere in the
literature.

With these results in hand, we return to our computation. Since

the sine function in Eq. (D12) may be written in terms of group generators. Using this and

from G(k, E). In the integral representation above, this simply means replacing e−(me2/γ)s

1]. As anticipated, this subtraction removes what would otherwise be a
singularity in the integral at s = 0.

2. Direct Contribution

To compute the integral (D39) (with the e2=0 piece removed), it is convenient to deform
the path of integration into the contours shown in Fig. 21. For the ﬁrst term in braces in the
integrand, the contour is taken to run ﬁrst over a portion of the imaginary axis, s = iφ, 0 <
φ < θ, and then to continue along the line parallel to the real axis, s
.
∞
The integration contour for the second term in the braces is the complex conjugate of the
ﬁrst. These contour deformations produce

Evaluating f (y) using the power series representation (D65) is appropriate if βeaeb/λab

is order one or smaller. But if βeaeb/λab is large, which corresponds to the formal m

limit, one needs the asymptotic form of f (y) for large argument. The result diﬀers depending
on whether the Coulomb interactions are attractive or repulsive. Consider the repulsive case
2mE is positive on the negative real E axis. In this case ¯I(0, z)
ﬁrst, where z = me2/√
has no poles on the negative real E axis, which reﬂects the absence of bound states for
repulsive potentials. Thus, for repulsive interactions the contour integral (D9) only wraps
about the positive E axis, and ¯I(0, z) appears with
< π. Hence the large m limit
may be obtained by using the large z asymptotic behavior of the ψ function,

APPENDIX E: FIRST QUANTUM CORRECTION TO CLASSICAL
ONE-COMPONENT PLASMA

Here we shall derive the leading, order ¯h2, quantum correction to the N-particle canon-
ical partition function of the classical, one-component plasma. This result appears in the
literature [Eq. (24) of [20]], but we will give a self-contained pedagogical treatment. To do
so, it is convenient ﬁrst to examine the path integral representation of the single-particle
partition function previously given in Eq. (B21), namely

the
changes, places this result in precisely the form of the ﬁrst line of Eq. (B52).

This general result may be applied to a one-component plasma in the presence of a
uniform neutralizing background charge density [since a strictly classical limit exists in this
special case where the charge carriers all have a common sign of their charge]. However, one
must be careful to properly handle the eﬀect of the neutralizing background charge density
before taking the thermodynamic limit. The easiest way to do so is to regard the interaction
potential for the one-component plasma as the µ

For inﬁnitesimal µ, the integral in the second term of Eq. (E17) is dominated by arbitrarily
large distances, and hence one may simply replace KN (r) in the integrand by its asymptotic
value of ¯n2. When multiplied by µ2, the resulting error one is making in the short distance

g2, it is entirely contained in the two-loop contribution of the equation of state; no O(¯h2)

Here we shall brieﬂy derive and review some of the methods of quantum ﬁeld theory
that are used in the text. For simplicity we shall explicitly treat the case of the functional
integral representation of the classical plasma without the induced interactions that provide
the quantum corrections which make the theory ﬁnite. These additional interactions entail
no essential changes in the techniques that we are about to outline, and their eﬀects are
easily described by including the appropriate additional terms in the functional integrand.
In the same vein, we shall also neglect the quantum-mechanical imaginary time dependence
discussed in Sec. III F. Thus we shall examine the generating functional

With the generalized chemical potential functions µa(r) taken to be constants, the generating
functional Z[µ] reduces to the grand canonical partition function. Functional derivatives
with respect to the generalized chemical potentials, with these potentials then taken to be
constants, yield number density correlation functions.

1. Perturbation Theory

Perturbation theory developments of correlation functions can be done in essentially
either of two ways: One can ﬁrst perform the functional derivatives with respect to the
generalized chemical potentials to bring down extra factors in the functional integrand that
represent the particle densities and then set the chemical potentials to be constants and make
a perturbative expansion. Or one can make a formal perturbative expansion of the functional
integral with spatially varying, generalized chemical potentials µa(r), and then expand the
result in a spatial varying part of the chemical potentials to identify the correlation functions.
Either case is subsumed in a slight generalization of the second way in which we write the
functional integration ﬁeld as φ(r) = ¯φ(r) + φ′(r), where ¯φ(r) is some suitable background
ﬁeld. We then take out and explicitly display the pieces of zeroth and second order in the
ﬂuctuation ﬁeld φ′(r). Since the background ﬁeld ¯φ appears as a ‘constant’ translation in
the (dummy) functional integration variable, [dφ] = [dφ′], and so with this separation and
with an operator or inﬁnite matrix notation,

Z[µ] = Det1/2

obtain a Gaussian functional integral which produces an inﬁnite, Fredholm determinant, we

This is the functional form than lends itself to a perturbative development by expanding
the exponential of the functional derivatives. Performing the functional derivatives produces
the “Wick contractions” that are familiar in quantum ﬁeld theory and lead to the familiar
graphical representation. The exact analytic form with the proper numerical factors asso-
ciated with a given graph is easily obtained from the expansion of the exponential and the
operation of the functional derivatives.63

2. Straightforward Expansions

We consider the ordinary partition function in which all the chemical potentials are
constants. This will illustrate the use of this functional derivative formulation in a straight-
forward fashion. In this case we take the background ﬁeld to vanish, ¯φ = 0, and so the
quadratic part of the action involves the lowest-order Debye (squared) wave number

with
that was deﬁned previously in Eq. (2.56). With constant chemical potentials and with ¯φ = 0,

while the determinantal prefactor reduces to that evaluated previously in Eq. (2.75) of the

63The functional derivatives may be viewed as ‘pacmen’ that eat up ﬁelds sprouting from vertices
with each pair of devoured ﬁelds connected by a line that represents the Green’s function G(r, r′).

3. Loop Parameter

It was emphasized in the text that the size of loop corrections is measured, in ν di-
mensions, by the dimensionless parameter βe2Gν(0)
, which reduces to βe2κ0 in
three dimensions: A perturbative term corresponding to a graph containing ℓ loops is of
order [βe2κν−2
]ℓ , or in three dimensions, [βe2κ0]ℓ. That is, the power of [βe2κ0] counts the
loop order of the expression. It should be noted that these loop graphs are connected and
single-particle irreducible. In this counting, e2 denotes a generic, typical charge of any of
the particle species, or, equivalently, one could write ea = Zae, and e is the electron charge.
Here we shall sketch the proof of this assertion.

This corresponds to a graph with N vertices. Functional derivatives with respect to µ(r)
may be taken to give number density correlators. We have omitted the subtraction of the

152

with the understanding that at least three φ functional derivatives are taken at each vertex
or that each vertex emits at least three propagator lines.

r′) becomes κν−2

Let us ﬁrst assume that functional derivatives have been taken so that each vertex is
connected by a single propagator line. At this stage, we have a graph which is a polygon with
N lines and N vertices. Note that since our counting applies to connected, single-particle
irreducible graphs, any of these graphs must have such a perimeter polygon. To exhibit
the parameters, we introduce dimensionless spatial coordinates by writing r = q/κ0. Then
the propagator Gν(r
times a dimensionless function of the dimensionless
q′). The functional derivative operations in Eq. (F24) produce a propagator
variable (q
line times β−1 with a factor of βe at each end of the line. Thus for each propagator line
and the vertex factors associated with both ends of the line we have an overall factor of
βe2κν−2
times n0 (a dimensionless product), and so, all
0
together for our skeleton polygon, we have N factors of βe2n0κ−2
κ2
0, and so
these are just N factors of 1. If we measure the size of this skeleton one-loop graph in term
of the unperturbed grand potential βΩ
remains to
characterize the order of the one-loop graph.

APPENDIX G: CALCULATIONS USING FUNCTIONAL METHODS

We turn now to apply the functional methods using the alternative background ﬁeld
method mentioned in the preceding Appendix. We choose the background ﬁeld ¯φ(r) used
there to be the solution φcl(r) of the classical ﬁeld equation of the total action which now
contains a source:

1. Results Through One Loop

We shall make use of this general result in the next section where the two-loop correction
will be evaluated. Here we note that action of the exponential of functional derivatives on
the exponential of ˜Sint produces only two and higher order loops since ˜Sint contains no linear
terms in φ′. Hence, to the one-loop order with which we are concerned here, we have

To obtain the eﬀective action described in Appendix A, we ﬁrst need the relation between

and φcl(r). Since the action Stot[φcl; σ; µ] is stationary for ﬁeld variations about φcl, the
induced variation in φcl when the source σ is varied does not contribute to δStot and only
the explicit source variation contributes, giving

The correction ∆φ(r) is a one-loop contribution corresponding to a “tadpole” graph. This
graph is just the same as the second graph in Fig. 12 except that now the vertex is given
by g3(r′) and the lines represent the Green’s function G(r, r′). With the source vanishing,
and with
a to this order. Thus,
to one-loop order, φcl can be taken to vanish in the explicitly one-loop term ∆φ, and the
Green’s functions there can be replaced by the Debye functions. With these remarks in
mind, it is easy to check that general one-loop result (G14) reduces to the previous result
(F21).

The eﬀective potential is taken to be a functional of the ﬁeld expectation value which we
relabel as ¯φ(r). The one-loop action (G7) is a functional of the classical ﬁeld φcl(r) which
diﬀers from the expectation value by the one-loop correction ∆φ(r). Since the classical action
is stationary for variations about φcl(r), replacing φcl(r) in it by ¯φ(r) entails a correction
involving ∆φ(r)2, which is of two-loop order. Since the determinantal contribution is already
of ﬁrst order, replacing φcl(r) in it by ¯φ(r) also gives a two-loop correction. Thus, to one-
loop order, we may replace φcl(r) by ¯φ(r) in the action functional (G7). [The explicit form
for ∆φ given in the previous paragraph is, of course, not needed to reach this conclusion.
We made this explicit calculation because the result will be used in the next section on the
two-loop eﬀective action.] The eﬀective action for the time-independent ﬁeld ¯φ is deﬁned by
simply restricting the Legendre transformation (A21) to involve time-independent quantities
so that the imaginary time integral is replaced by a factor of β. The source–ﬁeld product in
the Legendre transformation cancels the source term in the relation (G1) between Stot[φ; σµ]
and S[φ; µ], and we have to one-loop order

2. Two-Loop Eﬀective Action

We turn now to compute the eﬀective action to two-loop order. Before obtaining the
terms that contribute to two-loop order, it is instructive to examine some two-loop order
terms that cancel among themselves. As was discussed in Appendix A, the eﬀective action
is single particle irreducible. We can now see explicitly how this works out to the two-loop
order. In the preceding section, we noted that the replacement of φcl by

¯φ = φcl + ∆φ

(G26)

entailed two-loop corrections. First we note that, since the action is stationary for variations
about the classical solution, we have, to order ∆φ2,

∆φ(r)∆φ(r′) .

It is a straightforward matter to carry out the functional derivatives and verify that one set
of terms precisely cancels the previous “dumbbell” piece (G30a). Thus, we prove explicitly
to two-loop order that the eﬀective action functional has no single-particle reducible terms.

The remaining terms give

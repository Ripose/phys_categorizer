Rate equations are used to model spectroscopic observation of incoherent energy transfer in light-
harvesting antenna systems based upon known structures. A two-parameter two-dimensional model
is proposed. The transfer rates obtained, by matching the ﬂuorescent decay, are self-consistent
within our model.

I. INTRODUCTION

We have had a reasonably complete picture of the bac-
terial light-harvesting (LH) system recently [1,2]. Both
the inner antenna, LH1, and the outer antenna, LH2, are
assembled from the same module to form rings. Each
module consists of two short α-helical polypeptides co-
ordinate one carotenoid and three bacteriochlorophylls
(BChls). The LH2 is composed of 9 units, for Rhodopseu-
domonas acidophila [3], resemble a cylinder, with an
inner diameter 36˚A and an outer diameter 68˚A, while
the LH1 is composed of 16 units, for Rhodospirillum
rubrum [4], in order to accommodate the reaction cen-
ter (RC). The later has an outer diameter 116˚A and a
central diameter 68˚A. However, the exact numbers of
both complexes are variable [1,4,5].

Furthermore, the LH2 B850 BChl a form a complete
over-lapping ring in a hydrophobic environment, which
reduces the dielectric constant, while the B800 BChl a
are well separated and are in a polar environment. When
a BChl molecule is excited by light, the energy can reach
equilibrium within about 10ps [6]. A LH2 can function
as a storage ring to store the excited singlet state energy
for about 1100ps. However, the energy will transfer to
other rings before decaying. The hopping of energy con-
tinues from one ring to another one until a LH1, which
contains the RC, is ﬁnally reached. The total trip last
for about 5 to 50ps [3,7,9]. Apparently, there is a com-
petition between energy relaxation and energy transfer.

Historically, relatively few physicists have tackled
problems of photosynthesis. Notably, Montroll used ran-
dom walk concept to model energy transfer amongst an-
tenna rings on a lattice by considering its ﬁrst passage
time [10]. Later, Hemenger et al. proposed a more re-
alistic model by taking inhomogeneous transfer rate and
trapping of RCs into account [11].
Interestingly, it is
Pearlstein’s work which is most often cited in the liter-
ature [12]. In the mean time, almost all experimental-
ists try to ﬁnd some explanations for their spectral data.
However, due to lack of precise geometrical information
most eﬀorts are in vain.

Progresses in physics are often made along the line
structures - energy - dynamics. A goal of researches
nowadays is to ﬁnd the relation between structural and
spectral information obtained, expecting that the func-
tion of photosynthesis will be explained in terms of its
structure, and further drawing inferences from the model
by applying methods of mathematical or numerical anal-
ysis. Recently Timpmann et al. used a rate equation
model to describe energy trapping and detrapping by the
RC [13]. However, their antenna has no structure. Sk´ala
et al. also carried out a series of investigation by analyz-
ing the spectrum of a more realistic LH1 model [14–16].
However, their model is incompatible with the recent
structural ﬁnding. In this paper we established a two-
parameter model based on recent structural data.

in which Ans denote the excited BChl dimer, E ≡ P ∗BH is the excited state, with B representing the chlorophyll
monomer within the RC, and P ∗ is the excited special pair of BChl molecules.
It is a set of 17 coupled linear
. A similar model has been proposed
diﬀerential equations. The symmetry of this system is broken due to k
by Sk´ala et al.
[15]. However, the RC and the antenna ring are connected only at one site in the present model,
corresponding to the recent experimental observation.

which is a consequence of the master equation used, and is independent of the detail geometrical symmetry. The
16, since P 1
mode controlling the decay to the RC is within P 4
and kE. However,
all four parts will be inﬂuenced by the change of k. If one solves this set of diﬀerential equations by applying the
Laplace transformation method, one ﬁnds the solution divides into four distinct groups of decay channels, namely,
A5-A13; E-A1-A9; A3-A7-A11-A15; A2-A4-A6-A8-A10-A12-A14-A16. Because the rate constant matrix is hermitian, all
eigenvalues are negative. Furthermore, no eigenvalues are degenerated, in contrast to Sk´ala’s model which posses too
high degree of symmetry [16]. Letting k
does not bring in additional factorizability although the symmetry of
our model is restored. At k

It contains a zero eigenvalue, which signals the existence of a steady-state solution, as should be happened without
the decay to the RC. Degeneracy of eigenvalues is introduced as the transition to the RC is decreased.

III. SPECTROMETRY COMPARISON

We can verify our model against experiments: The
pump-probe spectroscopy measures the diﬀerence of two
beams, with

∆D = ∆ǫA X
n

An + ∆ǫEE ,

(11)

being the signal measured. The symbol ∆ǫ s are the di-
electrical constants diﬀerences between pump and probe
beams of the corresponding pigments. By choosing the
pump and probe laser frequencies, we can selectively de-
tect the population changes of P An or E. Summing
(1)-(4) we know that the decay of the total
over Eq.
population should be d(P An)/dt = −k
E. The
measured charge separation rate is kE ≈ 3.57 × 1011s−1
at room temperature and increases by 2 to 4 times from
300K to 10K depending on the species chosen [17,18].
The ratio of the forward and backward transition to the
RC is know to be about 25% [13] for an open RC, i.e.,
the RC BChl dimer (P) is reduced and the iron quinone
electron acceptor is oxidized; 40% for pre-reduced RC.
The back-trapping rate can, in principle, be estimated

or k

= exp(−∆G/kBT ), with ∆G the free-energy
from k
gap between A1 and E is estimated from their absorp-
tion peaks, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the
absolute temperature. However, the measured absorp-
tion peaks of the excited RC are broad and imprecise [8].
experi-
We do not know the absolute values of k
mentally since it is diﬃcult to tune the laser frequency
to distinguish An from E. Nor do we know the tran-
sition rate between Ans because transition between the
same species cannot be measured directly. Furthermore,
at room temperature, energy equilibrium within the an-
tenna interferes with the trapping process. Therefore we
have taken k and k
as parameters and ﬁt the slow mode
of ﬂuorescence decay of excited population observed, i.e.
200ps [6,7,9]. Thus, the absolute value of the largest
eigenvalue should be about 3/200ps = 1.5 × 1010s−1.
A computer code is written to scan all combinations of

to be smaller than −1.5 × 1010s−1 between −108s−1 to

k = 7.25 × 1011s−1. That k has to be equal to k
might
sound peculiar in view of the geometrical distance be-
tween A1 and RC is less than the distance between RC
and other Ans [4]. However, the species for donor and
acceptors are diﬀerent at these two cases. There are pos-
sibilities that the ﬁnal hopping rate are still the same.

tained from our model. From the table, we found that
the largest eigenvalue mode is important, not only for its
large separation from other eigenvalues but also for its

The transfer of excitation energy requires coupling
between the emitting molecule and the ground state
molecule. At an intermolecular separation involved be-
tween 10˚A to 100˚A, long-range resonance transfer of elec-
tronic excitation arises from coupling between the tran-
sition dipoles of the donor and the acceptor, which is the
F¨oster theory [19,20]. Since the BChl Qy dipoles lie in
the same plane, we have

k(R) ∝

1
τF

(

)6 ,

(12)

in which R0, measures transfer eﬃciency, is the F¨oster
radius. van Grondelle gave R0 = 90˚A for the BChl
875 to BChl 875 energy transfer and a ﬂuorescence life
time, τF , about 3000ps or slightly higher [21,22].
If a
putative separation distance between interacting BChl
a dimers ≈ 17.5˚A is used [4] we obtain an estimation
of k ≈ 6.17 × 1012s−1. This number is about an or-
der of magnitude higher than the value obtained from
our model. However, we know that the pairwise energy
transfer is about 1ps as we calculated [9]. On the other
hand, from the value of k obtained here, by ﬁtting the
200ps decay and the τF , we estimated the F¨oster radius
to be 26.8˚A. This result is consistent within our model
since we assumes only nearest neighbour transition. Fur-
ther, since we put the population at the antenna at t = 0
for our calculation,the rising time is inﬁnitely short, in-
stead of having some instrumental limits as observed ex-
perimentally. Although the light wave length is much

4

We have also introduced inhomogeneity, due to geo-
metrical distortion, into the rate constant. However, even
at large distortion, the basic character of the spectrum
will not change much. If the criteria for k = k
can be
established, we can further reduce the free parameters in
our model.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, a physicist’s approach [23] of incoherent
energy transfer within antenna ring is taken by consider-
ing a two-parameter two-dimensional model. This model
diﬀers from the one presented by Sk´ala et al.. The re-
ality might be somewhere between these two models. In
.
our model, we numerically found k has to be equal to k
Furthermore, we are able to calculate analytically some
of the eigenvalues and demonstrate explicitly that there
is a mode for decaying to the RC and other three modes.
However, this mode separation result depends upon the
exact number of unit involved in the ring. Therefore
should not be important. Perhaps we should interpret
the ﬁnding as: P 1
16 are redundant, since P 4
16
contains kE which should be important. A ring of 16
units is huge. The only purpose for such a large antenna
is to accommodate the RC.

Finally we remark that it is possible to extend a two-
dimensional random walk model of energy transfer into a
quasi-three-dimensional one, in view of the recent struc-
tural ﬁnding, with a recent result of random walk on bun-
dled structures by Cassi and Regina [24]. Furthermore,
this theoretical result should be able to be veriﬁed exper-
imentally using its spectral dimension by measurements
involving diﬀusion process such as time-resolved spec-
troscopy of nearest-neighbours energy transfer. Other
light-harvesting models and mechanisms are under fur-
ther investigation.

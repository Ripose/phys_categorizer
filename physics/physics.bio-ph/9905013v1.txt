CONDITIONS FOR THE FORMATION OF AXISYMMETRIC
BICONCAVE VESICLES

THOMAS KWOK-KEUNG AU AND TOM YAU-HENG WAN

Introduction

The extraordinary biconcave shape of a red blood cell has attracted much interest for

many years. In the last two decades, people generally accepted the shape of biological

membranes such as blood cells is closely related to the formation of lipid bilayer vesicle

in aqueous medium. Based on the elasticity of lipid bilayers proposed by Helfrich [H1],

the shape Σ, regarded as an embedded surface in R3, is determined by the minimum of

the bending energy involving the volume V(Σ) enclosed by Σ, the area A(Σ), the mean

curvature H and the Gaussian curvature K of Σ. More precisely, Helfrich suggested to

study the bending energy

where kc, ¯kc, c0, λ, and p are constants interpreted as follow: kc is the bending rigidity, ¯kc

the Gaussian curvature modulus, c0 the spontaneous curvature, λ the tensile stress, and

pi the osmotic pressure diﬀerence between the outer (po) and inner (pi) media.

p = po −
Here, we have taken a geometric sign convention so that Helfrich’s original bending energy

should be written in the above form.

According to the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, the second integral in the bending energy

is a topological constant. Therefore, within a certain topological class of Σ, it is suﬃcient

to study the functional,

where c0, ˜λ = 2λ/kc, and ˜p = 2p/kc are the constant parameters of the functional. This

functional will be referred as the Helfrich functional in this article.

Many interesting surfaces such as minimal surfaces, constant mean curvature surfaces

and Willmore surfaces can be regarded as critical points of the Helfrich functional for

suitable combinations of the parameters c0, ˜λ, and ˜p. New axisymmetric explicit solutions

had also been found recently [NOO2].

When c0 = ˜λ = ˜p = 0, the functional

(Σ) is referred as Willmore functional in

F

diﬀerential geometry which has been widely studied in recent decades. Moreover, there

are some important analysis and open problems concerning the Willmore functional, [W,

ch. 7]. As it is observed by physicists [DH], Willmore functional is not a good model

for the shape of red blood cells. This fact can also be seen by the result of geometers

that the unique minimum of the Willmore functional for topologically spherical vesicles

(embedded surfaces of genus zero in terms of topologist) is the round sphere. Therefore,

not all combinations of the parameters give stationary vesicles of shape similar to red

blood cells observed experimentally.

On the other hand, a typical way to investigate the minimizing surface is by ﬁnding

solutions to the variational equation of the functional

. A large class of axisymmetric

F

stationary vesicles of spherical and toroidal topology has been calculated, [DH, L, S, MB,

OY]. In these works, among other interesting shapes of lipid bilayer vesicles, the shape of

the red blood cell can be simulated numerically or given by a special solution a speciﬁc

variational equation with suitable combinations of the parameters. It is natural to ask for

the conditions on the parameters such that the Helfrich functional possesses a stationary

vesicle of biconcave shape.

Main Results. In this article, we are going to give clear conditions on how biconcave

axisymmetric surfaces are formed. More precisely, we ﬁnd a suﬃcent condition for that

the Helfrich shape equation of axisymmetric vesicles to have solutions of biconcave shape.

Besides, we exhibit that when the equation has a solution with reﬂection symmetry or

BICONCAVE AXISYMMETRIC VESICLES

3

of biconcave shape, certain geometric quantities of the vesicle must obey some conditions

governed by the parameters. These conditions on the parameters are very mild.

In

particular, the case that c0 > 0, ˜λ > 0, and ˜p > 0 is suﬃcient to ensure the existence of

biconcave solution. We also brieﬂy comment on how the combination of the parameters

c0, ˜λ, and ˜p aﬀects the existence of biconcave solution.

The suﬃcient condition for the formation of biconcave vesicle may be formulated in

terms of a cubic polynomial,

Q(t) = t3 + 2c0t2 + (c2

0 + ˜λ)t

We proved that if all roots of Q(t) are positive, then there is always an ax-

isymmetric biconcave vesicle which is the stationary surface for the Helfrich

functional. This result will be summary by the table at the end of this section (p. 5)

along with some typical pictures of Q(t) and the corresponding graphs of the solution and

its derivative.

It is easy to verify that Q(t)

Explicit formula for this in terms of the parameters can also be found. However, the

above is more concise and precise enough.

For the necessary condition, we observe that if c0 > 0 and there is an axisymmetric

stationary vesicle of biconcave shape, then its curvature at the center must be smaller

than the ﬁrst positive root of Q(t). In fact, we have

1. Equation for Axisymmetric Vesicles

In this article, we will study axisymmetric solution surface Σ of the Helfrich variation

problem which has a reﬂection symmetry by the plane perpendicular to the rotational

axis. If the rotational axis is labelled z-axis and the plane of reﬂection xy-plane, then the

surface Σ can be obtained by revolving a radial curve about the z-axis on the upper half

plane and reﬂecting it to the lower half.

In other words, one may parametrize the upper part of Σ by X = (r cos θ, r sin θ, z(r)),

with a function z(r) > 0 deﬁned for r in some interval [0, r∞], where r∞ is the radius

BICONCAVE AXISYMMETRIC VESICLES

of the “equator” that is determined by the surface. The natural boundary conditions

are z(0) > 0 and z(r∞) = 0. The rotation and reﬂection symmetries of the surface then

impose the conditions that z′(0) = 0 and z′(r)

as r

r∞. Finally, to model for a

→ −∞

→

biconcave surface, we also need to assume that z′′(0) > 0 in order to have a solution that

is concave at the center. Moreover, the biconcave shape of the surface also conﬁnes the

graph of z to have a unique point of inﬂection. This is equivalent to require that z′ has

only a unique maximum and no other critical point. A cross-section of the upper part of

Σ is shown in the picture.

Equation and Conditions. Usually, the Helfrich shape equation of axisymmetrc vesi-

cles is written in term of the angle ψ between the surface tangent and the plane perpen-

dicular to rotational axis [DH, JS, ZL]. However, it is convenient for our discussion to

rewrite the equation into a equation on the derivative of the graph w(r) = z′(r) = tan ψ.

Then the Helfrich shape equation of axisymmetrc vesicles becomes an equation for w,

which is

We are going to study the solution w(r) to this equation with initial choice w(0) = 0 and

w′(0) = w′

0 > 0. Our goal is to ﬁnd solution w that also satisﬁes the end point condition

that w(r)

Furthermore, w is required to have a unique local maximum and no other critical points.

A typical picture for the graph of such w is shown.

A typically expected graph of w = z′

There are two useful ways of grouping the lower order terms in the equation. A careful

study of these lower order terms reveals the qualitative behaviors of the solution w. One

of the grouping involves the polynomial Q(t) that we have mentioned in the introduction.

Let Q be the cubic polynomial Q(t) = t3 + 2c0t2 + (c2

0 + ˜λ)t

and R(t) be the

−
t3. With this notation, after multiplying

˜p

quadratic part of Q(t), that is, R(t) = Q(t)

with rw′, the equation (2) can be written as follow,

+ r3w′R(κ(r));

or

+ r3w′Q(κ(r)),

where κ(r) =

r√1 + w2 is the principal curvature of Σ in the meridinal direction.

In

other words, the lower order terms capture the changes of the meridinal curvature in

the diﬀerential equation. Note that if c0 = ˜λ = ˜p = 0, the solution to equation (2a)

corresponds to the situation that z = z(r) is a circular arc with radius 1/w′

0. This is

exactly the case when the meridinal curvature is a constant.

The initial choice w′

0 is actually the meridinal curvature at the center of Σ, i.e.,

κ(r) =

w

r√1 + w2 →

w′
0,

as r

→

Moreover, for both Q and R, Q(0) = R(0) =

−
0) < 0 and R(w′
smallest positive root of Q(t), then both Q(w′

˜p/2 < 0. Therefore, if w′

0 is less than the

0) < 0. Our analysis (in

3) shows that these negativity conditions are essential for the meridinal curvature κ(r)
§
to change sign. We will also demonstrate that, for any set of parameters satisfying our

BICONCAVE AXISYMMETRIC VESICLES

9

condition, a solution w(r) with w′

0 small enough always satisﬁes all of our requirements.

In fact, if exact values of the parameters are given, one can always calculate the suitable

value of w′

0 numerically.

2. Necessary conditions for the formation of biconcave solution

It turns out that the principal curvature of the vesicle Σ in the meridinal direction,

which we denoted by κ(r) =

equation (2b) implies that if c0 > 0 and the initial curvature at the center w′

r√1 + w2 , is the most basic quantity in our analysis. The
0 is large, in

w

the sense that R(w′

0) > 0, then κ(r) increases and a biconcave shape cannot be formed.

So a necessary condition for formation of axisymmetric solution of biconcave shape in the

case that c0 > 0 is

R(w′

0) = 2c0w′

0

+ (c2

0 + ˜λ)w′

0

2

˜p
2

−

< 0.

The following pictures show the behaviors of κ(r) for two diﬀerent values of w′

0 with

c0 = 1, ˜λ = 0.25, and ˜p = 1. For these parameter values, R(0.277124) = 0. The one on

the left hand side is taken with w′

0 = 0.278 so the necessary condition is not satisﬁed.

In this case, κ blows-up at ﬁnite distance from the rotational axis so the corresponding

solution will not lead to a closed surface of the desired biconcave shape. The picture on

the right hand side is taken with w′

0 = 0.276. In this case, the necessary condition is

satisﬁed, but κ only decays gradually and the solution w(r) still does not give a biconcave

surface. Numerically, we see that w(r)

as r

r∞ but the total area is positive,

→ −∞
i.e., the surface together with its reﬂection does not close up to form a closed surface

→

in R3 without self-intersection. However, we can only show that R(w′

0) < 0 implies the

decrease in κ(r) without knowing whether it implies the sign change of κ(r). So, it is

not sure whether R(w′

0) < 0 is suﬃcient for the formation of closed surface of biconcave

shape, a situation in which κ(r) has to change from positive to negative.

In order to obtained an axisymmetric solution with reﬂection symmetry via a solution

of ordinary diﬀerential equation, one also needs to verify the ﬁrst variation is zero with

respect to any variation near the plane of reﬂection. It turns out that this is always the

case for the solution we are going to study in the next section. Moreover, the analysis

shows that the radius r∞ of the “equator” and the Guassian curvature K(r∞) of the

vesicle at any point on the “equator” must satisfy the following relation,

1
K(r∞)2 = −
r∞
This relation is easily veriﬁed for the case that c0 = ˜λ = ˜p = 0. In this case, we have

Q

(cid:18)

.

Q(t) = t3 and K(r∞)2 =

. This is compatible with the fact that the solution surface

1

is a round sphere.

3. Sufficient condition for the formation of biconcave solution

In the preceding section, although that R(w′

0) < 0 is known to be a necessary con-

dition for the case that c0 > 0, it may not be suﬃcient. Hence, we need to impose a

BICONCAVE AXISYMMETRIC VESICLES

11

stronger condition that all roots of Q(t) are positive and require w′

0 to be small enough.

Unfortunately, we do not have a general formula for the threshold value of w′
0.

The smallness assumption on w′

0 implies that not only R(w′

0) < 0 but also Q(w′

0) < 0.

In this case, the meridinal curvature changes sign. And in terms of w(r), though it is

initially positive, it becomes negative when r reaches a certain value r0. Note that for

diﬀerent initial value w′

0, the value of r0 is diﬀerent. Although the precise relationship is

unknown, we know that r0 is comparable to w′
0

1/2

when w′

0 is small. More precisely, we

have the following limiting inequalities

In fact, we discover that, for any point of inﬂection rc of the graph of z(r) with κ(rc) > 0,

16
3˜p ≤

As a consequence of these inequalities, the solution will have a unique point of inﬂection

of the graph of z(r). Moreover, for the case that all roots of Q(t) are positive (see

2), the
§

function w(r) blows down monotonically to

in a ﬁnite distance from the rotational

−∞

axis after it becomes negative.

The following are pictures of z(r) and w(r) for c0 = 1, ˜λ = 0.25, ˜p = 1, and w′

0 =

0.26. This set of parameters satisﬁes our condition. In fact, Q(t) has a unique positive

root at 0.268828. So, it is clear that Q(w′

0) < 0 and the function w(r) goes to

at

−∞

5.39215. However, w′

0 = 0.26 is not small enough to give a solution w(r) with total

negative area and hence it does not give a vesicle of the required biconcave shape.

0 = 0.15 for the same set of parameters

c0 = 1, ˜λ = 0.25, and ˜p = 1, then in each case, the total area under the graph of w(r)

is nonpositive. Hence, each of the graph of z(r) can be reﬂected and rotated to form a

vesicle of biconcave shape. The following pictures are the function z(r) and w(r) for these

of w(r). Please refer to the mathematical paper by the authors for the details of the

analysis.

4. Discussion

Finally, we would like to remark on other solutions which do not correspond to bi-

concave surfaces. Firstly, when c2

0 + ˜λ < 0, one may still obtain solution for nonconvex

surface even w′

0 is not very small.

A solution which gives a nonconvex surface

The above picture is a solution for c0 = 1, ˜λ =

3, ˜p = 2 with w′

0 = 2. Note that w′

0 is

−

greater than the positive roots of R(t) and Q(t). Moreover, Q(t) has negative roots and

thus this is beyond the situation that we discuss in previous sections. In this case, after

w = z′ becomes negative, it may not decrease all the way to negative inﬁnity, which is

why a second “petal” may form.

The other type is a rotational solution which is not symmetric under reﬂection in

xy-plane [DH, HDH]. The following is a solution with c0 =

1 and ˜p = 1.

A solution which has no reﬂection symmetry

It can be observed that the upper part of this solution satisﬁes our equation (2) but

not the area condition. Although the reﬂected graph is also a solution locally, it does

not give rise to a surface without self-intersection. For this combination of parameters,

there is a bifurcation of solution at r∞ to close up by an asymmetric surface. From our

numerical study, it should be remarked that not all solutions in the upper quadrant may

be closed up by an asymmetric counterpart. For example, if the upper part satisﬁes the

area condition, the only possible lower part is the reﬂection symmetric one. This suggests

a possible uniqueness of biconcave solution. Furthermore, we surmise that for c0 > 0,

˜λ > 0 and ˜p > 0, solution of the asymmetric type never occurs. The local minimum of

Q(t) for t < 0 may be the underlying obstruction of such happening. However, at the

moment, there is not yet a mathematical proof.

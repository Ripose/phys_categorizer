A new Rayleigh-type instability is proposed to explain the ‘sausage-string’ pattern of alternating
constrictions and dilatations formed in blood vessels under inﬂuence of a vasoconstricting agent. Our
theory involves the nonlinear elasticity characteristics of the vessel wall, and provides predictions
for the conditions under which the cylindrical form of a blood vessel becomes unstable.

High blood pressure can experimentally be induced by
intravenous infusion of a vasoconstricting agent like an-
giotensin II (regulates the contraction of the smooth mus-
cle cells surrounding the blood vessel) [1–3]. As the infu-
sion is continued, a substantial narrowing of the smaller
blood vessels is observed, and suddenly the narrowed ves-
sels develop a peculiar pattern consisting of alternating
regions of constrictions and dilatations, giving the ves-
sels the appearance of sausages on a string (Fig. 1). The
‘sausage-string’ pattern may cause severe damages to the
blood vessels because plasma and macromolecules are
transported into the vessel wall in the dilated regions.
The sausage-string pattern has been observed in small
vessels from many organs, including the brain, the gut,
and the kidney [4].

Despite several decades of research, the mechanism
causing the ‘sausage-string’ pattern has remained un-
known [4].
It has been suggested that it represents a
‘blow out’ of the vessel wall due to the high blood pres-
sure [5], but this seems unlikely for several reasons. The
sausage-string pattern occurs in the smaller vessels (small
arteries and large arterioles), and here the pressure ele-
vation is relatively small compared to that in the larger
Secondly, the phenomenon is highly repro-
arteries.
ducible [2]. If the infusion of the vasoconstricting agent
is stopped, the normal, uniform ‘cylindrical’ structure is
restored. Restoring the infusion causes again an extreme,
uniform vasoconstriction followed by the reappearance of
the sausage-string pattern. A third spectacular feature of
the phenomenon is its periodicity with constrictions and
dilatations occurring in a regular and repetitive pattern.
In this Letter we present a simple anisotropic, elastic
model of the vessel wall. We show that under certain hy-
pertensive conditions an instability occurs which leads to
a periodic pattern of constrictions and dilatations along
the vessel. Our theory provides predictions for the con-
ditions under which the cylindrical form of a blood vessel
becomes unstable.

To be speciﬁc, a cylindrical shaped blood vessel is un-
stable if a small axial symmetric perturbation of the inner

→

radius, r
r + u(z), grows (Fig. 2). To determine the
stability, we must therefore know the dynamic equation
for the perturbation u(z, t). To this end, we invoke the
continuity equation, ∂t(πr2) =
∂zJ, associating a local
change of the cross-sectional area at a downstream site z
with a ﬂuid ﬂux J(z). The ﬂux is related to the trans-
c(r)∂zP , where c(r) is the
mural pressure P , by J =
−
vascular conductance [6]. From the continuity equation
and the ﬂux-pressure relation, the dynamic equation to
lowest order in the perturbation follows,

As a simple illustration, consider ﬁrst a very thin ves-
sel wall, for which the pressure is given by the Laplace
form [7] P = (T /R) + (Tz/Rz), where T and Tz are the
tensions circumferential to and parallel with the cylinder
axis z, and 1/R and 1/Rz are the curvatures in the cor-
responding directions [8]. Assume furthermore that the
tensions are constant and identical, Tz = T . Inserting
the above expression for the pressure into Eq. (1) and
retaining only ﬁrst order terms in u, we get

∂tu =

For a given periodic perturbation, u = uk(t) cos(kz), we
have uk(t)

uk(0)eλkt, where

λk =

r2k2] .

Thus the vessel wall is unstable to modes with rk < 1.
The dominant mode, where λk is maximal, is at k =
1/(√2r).

The above instability is the well-known Rayleigh in-
stability [9,10]. The theory explains why a cylindrical
column of water with surface tension T is unstable at all
radii. However, cylindrical structures may be stable due
to a reluctance against bending [11]. Still an instability
may occur if the tension T can be brought to exceed a

1

critical value of order κ/r2, κ being the bending modu-
lus [11]. This is demonstrated by the so-called ‘pearling’
instability, recently observed by Bar-Ziv and Moses [12]
in tubular lipid membranes.

For blood vessels the width of the vessel wall cannot
be neglected. Furthermore, the stress is highly nonlinear
and strongly dependent on the strain [7]. Taking the
width w of the blood vessel into account, the Laplacian
form for the pressure is replaced by an integral,

where S is the angular stress, and Sz is the stress along
the vessel. The stresses, deﬁned as the forces per ac-
tual cross-sectional area, are related to the experimen-
tally measured idealized stresses σ and σz, deﬁned as the
forces per relaxed cross-sectional area, S = γγzσ and
Sz = γγzσz [13]. Here γ and γz are the normalized
lengths [14] in the angular and vessel direction. Since
the length of a vessel remains almost constant during a
contraction, γz is here assumed to be constant, γz = γ0.
Correspondingly, the stress σz is replaced by a constant
σ0. We note that the width w of the vessel wall changes
when the inner radius r changes (Fig. 2). Assuming that
the cross-sectional area of the vessel wall is constant, the
radius dependence of w is given, when the inner radius ρ
and wall thickness ω are known for the angularly relaxed
state (γ = 1) [15].

As seen from the expression for I, Eq. (10), the impor-
tant quantity is σ/γ. The point of instability is where
σ/γ calculated at the inner radius equals the value of
σ/γ at the outer radius. This can be illustrated geomet-
rically by drawing a line in the plot of σ versus γ (Fig. 3)
from (0, 0) through (γr, σ(γr)). If the point (γw, σ(γw))
lies above this line, I(r) is positive and the cylindrical
form is stable. If however the point (γw, σ(γw)) lies be-
low this line, I(r) is negative, leading to an instability of
the cylindrical form.

Under normal physiological conditions, the angular
stress σ in blood vessels increases linearly to exponen-
tially with the normalized length [7,16] (Fig. 3), and the
value of I(r) is therefore positive (Fig. 4). This ensures
that the blood vessel keeps its cylindrical shape – no
bending arguments are needed to explain the stability
of the cylindrical shape of a blood vessel. However, when
acute hypertension is induced by infusion of a strong
vasoconstricting agent like angiotensin II, there will be
a substantial reduction of the inner radius in small arter-
ies and large arterioles due to contraction of the smooth
muscle cells. The operating point for the vessel will now
be on a less steep part of the σ
γ curve (Fig. 3), and
when the radius is reduced below a certain inner radius
rc at which σ(γw)/γw = σ(γr)/γr, the value of I(r) be-
comes negative (Fig. 4). This will result in an instability
of the cylindrical form, giving rise to the ‘sausage-string’
pattern. The dominant (fastest growing) mode is given
/(2I0)]1/2, which will correspond to ‘sausages’
by k = [
I
|
|
of length ℓ = 2π
. Insertion of typical values [17]
I
|
|
for the various parameters of the model yields ℓ
2πρ,
hence the length of the ‘sausages’ will be 5-10 times the
radius of the relaxed vessel. The theory therefore pre-
dicts that the ‘sausages’ will have an elongated shape
with a length that decreases as the vessel radius gets
smaller. This is in good agreement with experimental
observations [2] (Fig. 1).

A way to view the basic phenomenon underlying the
instability is to note that, when I(r) becomes negative,
the pressure at slightly larger radii is smaller than at
slightly smaller radii. Accordingly, the resulting ﬂow J

2

will be directed from low-radii regions to high-radii re-
gions, causing the small radii to become even smaller,
and the large radii to become larger. This continues un-
til the pressure stabilizes at a value which is the same
for both the large radius rmax and the small radius rmin.
The stabilization is only possible, because the pressure
for radii above the instability, r > rc, again increases
with r. The theory allows an estimate of the radius in
the dilated regions, rmax. Assuming that rmin/ρ is small
(close to zero), we can estimate the ﬁnal value of rmax by
the condition P (rmax) = P (0). Interestingly, the almost
linear stress function in the region above rc (Fig. 3) gives
rise to a decay of I(r) in the same region (Fig. 4). As
a consequence rmax can become quite large. However,
close to γ = 1, the stress increases exponentially due to
the elastic properties of the vessel wall [7], and the value
of I(r) will increase rapidly. This will eﬀectively prevent
rmax from attaining a value substantially larger than the
relaxed radius, ρ, of the vessel. However, rmax may be
larger than the working radius of the vessel under nor-
mal physiological conditions, because the normal working
radius is smaller than the relaxed radius [7]. This may
explain why previous work have suggested that the di-
lated regions represented a ‘blow out’ due to mechanical
failure of the vessel wall [5].

The ‘sausage-string’ pattern following infusion of an-
giotensin II have been found to occur predominantly in
small arteries and large arterioles [2]. The present anal-
ysis predicts that large vessels will be stable. Their op-
erating point are on the steep portion of the σ
γ curve
due to their high pressure. As seen from Fig. 3, the con-
traction is here limited, thus preventing the larger vessels
from reducing their radius below the critical value rc. As
arterial vessels gets smaller the wall-to-lumen ratio ω/ρ
increases [7]. From the expression for I(r), Eq. (10), we
ﬁnd that rc as well as rmax decreases with increasing
wall-to-lumen ratio. Hence, the ‘sausage-string’ insta-
bility is less likely to appear in blood vessels with large
wall-to-lumen ratios. It seems that the transmural pres-
sure and the contractile potential sets an upper limit, and
the wall-to-lumen ratio a lower limit for vessels that will
undergo the ‘sausage-string’ instability in response to an
acute increase in blood pressure.

In summary, we have demonstrated that during severe
vasoconstriction, the normal cylindrical shape of a blood
vessel may become unstable, and as a result the vessel ex-
hibit a periodic pattern of constrictions and dilatations.
The sausage-string pattern is not caused by a mechanical
failure of the vessel wall due to the high blood pressure,
but is the expression of an instability. The instability is
related to the Rayleigh instability, and to the ‘pearling’
instability seen in tubular lipid membranes. The mech-
anism behind the instability, however, is novel, involv-
ing the nonlinear elasticity characteristics of the vessel
wall. The developed theory explains many of the key
features observed experimentally, e.g. the predominant
occurrence in small arteries and large arterioles, and most
likely in those with small wall-to-lumen ratios.

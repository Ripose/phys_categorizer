Background

Results

Conclusions

Gene regulation in eukaryotes is mainly eﬀected through transcription fac-
tors binding to rather short recognition motifs generally located upstream
of the coding region. We present a novel computational method to identify
regulatory elements in the upstream region of eukaryotic genes. The genes
are grouped in sets sharing an overrepresented short motif in their upstream
sequence. For each set, the average expression level from a microarray ex-
periment is determined: If this level is signiﬁcantly higher or lower than the
average taken over the whole genome, then the overerpresented motif shared
by the genes in the set is likely to play a role in their regulation.

The method was tested by applying it to the genome of Saccharomyces cere-
visiae, using the publicly available results of a DNA microarray experiment,
in which expression levels for virtually all the genes were measured during
the diauxic shift from fermentation to respiration. Several known motifs
were correctly identiﬁed, and a new candidate regulatory sequence was de-
termined.

We have described and successfully tested a simple computational method to
identify upstream motifs relevant to gene regulation in eukaryotes by studying
the statistical correlation between overepresented upstream motifs and gene
expression levels.

Introduction

One of the biggest challenges of modern genetics is to extract biologically
meaningful information from the huge mass of raw data that is becoming
available.
In particular, the availability of complete genome sequences on
one hand, and of genome-wide microarray data on the other, provide invalu-
able tools to elucidate the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation.
The sheer amount of available data and the complexity of the mechanisms at
work require the development of speciﬁc data analysis techniques to identify
statistical patterns and regularities, that can then be the subject of experi-
mental investigation.

The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is known to be mainly ef-
fected through transcription factors binding to rather short recognition motifs
generally located upstream of the coding region. One of the main problems
in studying regulation of gene expression is to identify the motifs that have
transcriptional meaning, and the genes each motif regulates.

The usual approach to this kind of analysis begins by identifying groups
of co-regulated genes, for example by applying clustering techniques to the
expression proﬁles obtained from microarray experiments. One then studies
the upstream sequences of a set of coregulated genes looking for shared motifs.
Examples of this approach as applied to S. cerevisiae are Refs. [1, 2, 4].

In this paper we suggest an alternative method which somehow follows the
inverse route: genes are grouped into (non-disjoint) sets, each set being char-
acterized by a short motif which is overrepresented in the upstream sequence.
For each set, the average expression is computed for a certain microarray ex-
periment, and compared to the genome-wide average expression from the
same experiment. If a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence is found, then the
motif that deﬁnes the set of genes is a candidate regulatory sequence. The
rationale for looking for overrepresented motifs is that, in many instances,
regulatory motifs are known to appear repeated many times within a rela-
tively short upstream sequence [2, 3], so that the number of repetitions turns
out to be much bigger than what would be expected from chance alone.

A somehow related approach, which does not require any previous grouping
of genes based on their expression proﬁles, was presented in Ref. [5], where

3

the eﬀect of upstream motifs on gene expression levels is modeled by a sum
of activating and inhibitory terms. Experimental expression levels are then
ﬁtted to the model, and statistically signiﬁcant motifs are identiﬁed. Our
approach diﬀers in the importance given to overrepresented motifs, thus con-
sidering activation and inhibition as an eﬀect that depends on a threshold
number of repetitions of a motif rather than on additive contributions from
all motifs. Clearly the two mechanisms are far from being mutually exclu-
sive, therefore we expect the candidate regulatory sites found with the two
methods to signiﬁcantly overlap.

However it is important to notice that the kind of statistical correlation be-
tween upstream motifs and expression that our algorithm identiﬁes does not
depend on any special assumption on the functional dependence of expres-
sion levels on the number of motif repetitions, as long as this dependence is
strong enough to provide a signiﬁcant deviation from the average expression
when enough copies of the motif are present. A comparison of our results
with those obtained in Ref.
[5] is provided in the “Results and discussion”
section.

The method

In general the motifs with known regulatory function are not identiﬁed with
a ﬁxed nucleotide sequence, but rather with sequences where substitutions
are allowed, or spaced dyads of ﬁxed sequences, etc. However in this study, in
order to test the method while keeping the technical complications to a mini-
mum, we will limit ourselves to ﬁxed short nucleotide sequences, that we call
words. While previous studies (see e.g [2]) show that even this simple analysis
can give interesting results, the method we present can easily be generalized
to include variable sequences and other more complicated patterns.

The computational method we propose has two main steps: ﬁrst the open
reading frames (ORFs) of an eukaryote genome are grouped in (overlapping)
sets based on words that are overrepresented in their upstream region, com-
pared to their frequencies in the reference sample made of all the upstream
regions of the whole genome. Each set is labelled by a word. Then for each of
these sets the average expression in one or more microarray experiments are
compared to the genome-wide average: if a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence

4

is found, the word that labels the set is a candidate regulatory site for the
genes in the set, either enhancing or inhibiting their expression.

It is worth stressing that the grouping of the genes into sets depends only on
the upstream sequences and not on the microarray experiment considered:
It needs to be done only once for each organism, and can then be used to
analyse an arbitrary number of microarray experiments. It is precisely this
fact that should allow the extension of the method to patterns more complex
than ﬁxed sequences, while keeping the required computational resources
within reasonable limits.

Constructing the sets

We consider the upstream region of each open reading frame (ORF), and
we ﬁx the maximum length K of the upstream sequence to be considered.
The choice of K depends on the typical location of most regulatory sites: in
general K is a number between several hundred and a few thousand. For
each ORF g, the actual length of the sequence we consider is Kg deﬁned
as the minimum between K and the available upstream sequence before the
coding region of the previous gene.

For each word w of length l (6 ≤ l ≤ 8 in this study), and for each ORF g
we compute the number mg(w) of occurrences of w in the upstream region of
g. Non palindromic words are counted on both strands: therefore we deﬁne
the eﬀective number of occurrences ng(w) as

ng(w) = mg(w) + mg( ˜w)
ng(w) = mg(w)

if w = ˜w

if w 6= ˜w

where ˜w is the reverse complement of w.

We deﬁne the global frequency p(w) of each word w as

p(w) =

g ng(w)
g Lg(w)

P

P
where, in order to count correctly the available space for palindromic and
non palindromic words,

Lg(w) = 2(Kg − l + 1)

if w 6= ˜w

5

(1)
(2)

(3)

(4)

Lg(w) = (Kg − l + 1)

if w = ˜w

(5)

p(w) is therefore the frequency with which the word w appears in the up-
stream regions of the whole genome: it is the “background frequency” against
which occurrences in the upstream regions of the individual genes are com-
pared to determine which words are overrepresented.

For each ORF g and each word w we compute the probability bg(w) of ﬁnding
ng(w) or more occurrences of w based on the global frequency p(w):

bg(w) =

Lg(w)

Xn=ng(w)  

Lg(w)

n !

p(w)n [1 − p(w)]Lg(w)−n

(6)

We deﬁne a maximum probability P , depending in general on the length l of
the words under consideration, and consider, for each w, the set

S(w) = {g : bg(w) < P }

(7)

of the ORFs in which the word w is overepresented compared to the frequency
of w in the upstream regions of the whole genome. That is, w is considered
overrepresented in the upstream region of g if the probability of ﬁnding ng(w)
or more instances of w based on the global frequency is less than P .

This completes the construction of the sets S(w). Two free parameters have
to be ﬁxed: the length K of the upstream region to be considered and the
probability cutoﬀ P for each length l of words considered. A result in Ref.
[2] suggests suitable choices of these two numbers: the authors list the 34
ORFs of S. cerevisiae that have 3 or more occurrences of the word GATAAG
in their 500 bp upstream region. 23 out of these 34 ORFs correspond to a
gene with known function, and 20 out of these 23 are regulated by nitrogen.
This result suggests to choose K = 500 for the upstream length, and a
value of the probability cutoﬀ such that three or more instances of GATAAG
in the 500 bp upstream region of an ORF are considered signiﬁcant. Any
choice of P between 0.018 and 0.1 would satisfy this criterion, and we chose
P = 0.02. Tentatively, we kept the same value of P for all values of l.
With this choice, the number of instances of a word that are necessary to be
considered overrepresented in a 500bp upstream sequence can be as high as
six for common 6-letter words and as low as one for rare 8-letter words. In

6

particular, our set S(GAT AAG) almost1 coincides with the one discussed in
[2]. However the word GATAAG will not turn out to be signiﬁcant in our
study.

As noted above, it would be natural to make the probability cutoﬀ P depend
on the word length, simply because the number of possible words increases
with their length: For example one could take the cutoﬀ for each word length
to be inversely proportional to the number of independent words of such
length. However it turns out that this procedure tends to construct sets that
are less signiﬁcant when tested for correlation with expression. Therefore we
chose to ﬁx the cutoﬀ at 0.02 for all word lengths. It is important to keep
in mind that no statistical signiﬁcance whatsoever is attributed to the sets
per se: The only sets that are retained at the end of the analysis are the
ones that show signiﬁcant correlation with expression. Therefore the choice
of the cutoﬀ in the construction of the sets can be based on such a pragmatic
approach without jeopardizing the statistical relevance of the ﬁnal result.

Studying the average expression level in each set

The second step of our procedure consists in studying, for each set S(w)
deﬁned as above, the expression proﬁles of the ORFs belonging to S(w) in
DNA microarray experiments. The idea is that if the average expression pro-
ﬁle in the set S(w) for a certain experiment is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
average expression for the same experiment computed on the whole genome,
then it is likely that some of the ORFs in S(w) are coregulated and that the
word w is a binding site for the common regulating factor.

To look for such instances we consider the gene expression proﬁles during
the diauxic shift, i.e. the metabolic shift from fermentation to respiration,
as measured with DNA microarrays techniques in Ref.
[1]. In the experi-
ment gene expression levels were measured for virtually all the genes of S.
Cerevisiae at seven time-points while such metabolic shift took place. The
experimental results are publicly available from the web supplement to Ref.
[1].

1Our set is smaller that the one reported in Ref.

[2] because we do not allow the
upstream sequence to overlap with the previous gene: this eliminates 7 genes form the set.

7

We considered each time-point as a single experiment, and for each gene g
we deﬁned the quantity rg(i) (1 = 1, . . . , 7) as the log2 of the ratio between
the mRNA levels for the gene g at time-point i and the initial mRNA level.
Therefore e.g. rg(i) = 1 means a two-fold increase in expression at timepoint
i compared to initial expression.

For each time-point i we computed the genome-wide average expression R(i)
and its standard deviation σ(i). These are reported in Tab. 1, where N(i)
is the number of genes with available expression value for each timepoint.
Then for each word w we compute the average expression in the subset of Sw
given by the genes for which an experimental result is available at timepoint
i (in most cases this coincides with Sw):

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

Rw(i) =

1
N(i, w)

rg(i)

Xg∈Sw

∆Rw(i) = Rw(i) − R(i)

where N(i, w) is the number of ORFs in Sw for which an experimental result
at timepoint i is available, and the diﬀerence

∆Rw(i) is the discrepancy between the genome-wide average expression at
time-point i and the average expression at the same time-point of the ORFs
that share an abundance of the word w in their upstream region. A signiﬁ-
cance index sig(i, w) is deﬁned as

sig(i, w) =

N(i, w)

∆Rw(i)
σ(i)

q

and the word w is considered signiﬁcantly correlated with expression at time
point i if

|sig(i, w)| > Λ

In this work we chose Λ = 6: this means that we consider meaningful a
deviation of Rw(i) by six s.d.’s from its expected value. The sign of sig(i, w)
indicates whether w acts as an enhancer or an inhibitor of gene expression.

Results and discussion

We found a total of 29 words of length between 6 and 8 above our signiﬁcance
threshold |sig| > 6. Most of them are related to known regulatory motifs;

8

two words turned out to be false positives due to the presence, in their sets,
of families of identical ORF’s. Finally, one word does not match any known
motif and is a candidate new binding site.

The comparison between our signiﬁcant words and known motifs was per-
formed using the database of regulatory motifs made publicly available by
the authors of Ref. [6], and the CompareACE software [7] available from the
same web source. This package allowed us to compute the Pearson correlation
coeﬃcient of the best alignment between each of our signiﬁcant words and
each known regulatory motif (expressed as a set of nucleotide frequencies).

We used the following criterion to associate our signiﬁcant words to known
motifs: a motif is considered as identiﬁed if at least one signiﬁcant word
scores better than 0.8 when compared to it. A probability value for this
choice of the cutoﬀ can be estimated to be a few percent: out of all the 2080
independent 6-letter words, 66 (that is 3.17%) score better than 0.8 with at
least one motif. For 7- and 8-letter words we have respectively 2.21% and
1.51%. Once a motif has been identiﬁed, all words which score best with
the motif are attributed to it, independently of the score, provided their
expression pattern is consistent with the word(s) scoring better than 0.8.

PAC and RRPE motifs

Nine signiﬁcant words can be associated to the PAC motif [8, 4, 7], all of
them with rather high scores. They are shown in Tab. 2, where, as in all the
following tables, signiﬁcativity indices are shown only for those timepoints
where they exceed our threshold |sig| > 6. Given the perfect alignment of
these words, it is not surprising that these sets largely overlap each other:
The union af all the nine sets contains a total of 96 genes. As an example,
in Fig. 1 we show the average expression for the genes associated with the
word GATGAG as a function of the time, compared to the average expression
computed over the whole genome. Fig. 2 shows the signiﬁcance index for
the same set. In Tab. 3 we show the set of 24 genes associated to the word
GATGAG, together with their expression proﬁles.

Two words can be associated with conﬁdence to the motif RRPE [4, 7], and
are shown in Tab. 4. The union of the two sets contains 76 genes. We see that
genes containing the motifs PAC and RRPE are repressed at the late stage

of the diauxic shift compared to the early stages. This result is in agreement
with the expression coherence score data available from the web supplement
to Ref. [6]: There one can see that (1) of all known regulatory motifs, PAC
and RRPE show the highest expression coherence for the diauxic shift and
(2) viceversa, of the eight experimental conditions considered in Ref. [6], the
diauxic shift is the one in which both the PAC and RRPE motif show the
highest expression coherence score.

STRE and MIG1 motifs

A total of ten signiﬁcant words can be associated to the motifs STRE [9, 10]
and MIG1 [11, 12]. It is well known that these play an important role in
glucose repression (see e.g.
[1, 13] and references therein). Most of these
words show comparable scores for the two motifs (due to their similarity) so
we decided to show them together in Tab. 5 which shows the two scores for
each word. A total of 212 genes belong to the union of all these sets.

The UME6 motif

Two words are associated to the known UME6 motif, a.k.a. URS1 [14, 15],
known to be a pleiotropic regulator implicated in glucose repression [16].
They are shown in Tab. 6. The two sets do not overlap, so that a total of 56
genes are associated to this motif.

Other signiﬁcant words

Three words, shown in Tab. 7, are of uncertain status: for the ﬁrst one, the
set S(ACTTTC) contains only 2 genes, making the statistical signiﬁcance
of the result questionable. The word CCCCTGAA scores best with the
PDR motif (0.58): given the low signiﬁcance of this score, and the fact that
PDR does not seem to be relevant for any other word, this is most likely
accidental. The word should probably be considered as belonging to the
STRE/MIG1 motif (the scores are STRE: 0.46, MIG1: 0.49). Finally the
word GCCCCTGA scores best with UME6 (0.55), but its expression pattern
is more similar to the STRE/MIG1 motifs (scores: STRE:0.44, MIG1: 0.46).

12

False positives due to families of identical or nearly identical ORF’s

The genome of S. cerevisiae contains a few families of genes whose coding
and upstream regions are identical or nearly identical. Consider for example
the COS1 gene (YNL336W): the seven genes COS2-COS8 have both coding
sequence and 500kb upstream sequence coinciding better than 80% with the
COS1 sequence. Therefore if the upstream sequence of COS1 contains over-
erpresented words, they will likely appear in all of the upstream regions. On
the other hand, the expression proﬁles of all the genes in the family will be
the same when measured by a microarray experiment, simply because the
experimental apparatus cannot distinguish between the mRNA produced by
the various members of the family, due to cross-hybridization between their
mRNA. Therefore all of the genes of the family are likely to occur in the sets
of the words that are overrepresented in their upstream region, and even a
small deviation from the genome-averaged expression acquires a statistical
signiﬁcance.

We found two instances of this in our analysis: the words GACGTAGC
and GGTCGCAC appear to be associated to signiﬁcant enhancement of the
corresponding sets of genes at late timepoints in the diauxic shift: however
the two sets contain respectively seven out of eight and all of the COS1-
COS8 genes. Since the COS genes are mildly overexpressed, this creates
a false statistical signiﬁcance. When one corrects for this, by keeping only
one representative of the family, the statistical signiﬁcance of the two sets
disappears.

A candidate new motif

Finally, the word ATAAGGG/CCCTTAT is a candidate new binding site,
since it does not have good comparison scores with any of the known motifs.
It scores best with the AFT1 motif, with a 0.52 score which is practically
meaningless since 84.9% of all independent 7-letter words score the same or
better with at least one motif. It is associated with 13 genes, as shown in
Tab. 8, which are overexpressed at late timepoints. The average expression
levels for the set and the signiﬁcance index are shown as a function of time
in Figs. 3 and 4.

As stated in the introduction, the method proposed in Ref.[5] also allows one
to identify regulatory motifs without any previous clustering of gene expres-
sion data: a linear dependence of the logarithm of the expression levels on
the number of repetitions of each regulatory motifs is postulated, and motifs
are ranked according to the reduction in χ2 obtained when such dependence
is subtracted from the experimental expression levels. Iteration of the pro-
cedure produces a model, that is a set of relevant regulatory motifs, for each
expression data set.

[5] such a model is presented for the 14 min.

In Ref.
time point in the
α-synchronized cell-cycle experiment of Spellmann et al., Ref. [17]. We used
our algorithm on the same data set to compare the ﬁndings. Let us con-
centrate on the 7-letter words (the longest considered in [5]). We found 9
signiﬁcant words, reported in Tab. 9. Of these, ﬁve coincide with or are very
similar to words found by the authors of Ref.[5] (see their Tab. 2). The re-
maining four (AGGCTAA, GGCTAAG, GCTAAGC and CTAAGCG, whose
similarity clearly suggests the existence of a longer motif) are of particular
interest for the purpose of comparing the two methods: If one looks at the
dependence of the expression levels on the number of occurrences of these
words in the 500 bp upstream region, one clearly sees the existence of an
activation threshold (see Fig. 5, where such dependence is shown for GGC-
TAAG). On the other hand, by looking at these data one hardly expects a
signiﬁcant reduction in χ2 when trying to describe this dependence with a
straight line. This should be compared to the same dependence for the word
AAAATTT, shown in Fig. 6, which is found by both algorithms. On the
other hand, there are two 7-word motifs found in [5] that do not pass our
signiﬁcativity threshold, that is CCTCGAC and TAAACAA.

We can conclude that the two methods tend to ﬁnd motifs with a diﬀerent
eﬀect on gene expression: probably the best results can be obtained by using
them both on the same data set.

Conclusions

We have presented a new computational method to identify regulatory mo-
tifs in eukaryotes, suitable to identify those motifs that are eﬀective when
repeated many times in the upstream sequence of a gene. The main feature

that diﬀerentiates our method from existing algorithms for motif discovery
is the fact that genes are grouped a priori based on similarities in their up-
stream sequences.

Most of the signiﬁcant words the algorithm ﬁnds can be associated to ﬁve
known regulatory motifs: This fact consitutes a strong validation of the
method. Three of them (STRE, MIG1 and UME6) were previously known
to be implicated in glucose suppression, while the fact that PAC and RRPE
sites are relevant to regulation during the diauxic shift is in agreement with
expression coherence data as reported in the web supplement to Ref.
[6].
One of the signiﬁcant words we ﬁnd (ATAAGGG) cannot be identiﬁed with
any known motif, and is a candidate new binding site.

It is easy, at least in principle, to extend the method to a larger class of
regulatory sites. According to our knowledge of gene regulation, this should
be done at least in two directions: (1) the analysis should not be restricted
to ﬁxed sequences, but extended to motifs with controlled variability;
in
particular the extension to spaced dyads [18] should be straightforward; (2)
the combinatorial analysis of binding sites [6] could also be performed along
the same lines, that is ﬁrst grouping genes according to which combinations
of motifs appear in their upstream region, and then analysing expression
proﬁles within each group.

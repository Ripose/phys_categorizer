A general approach for calculating spectral and optical properties of pigment-protein complexes of known
atomic structure is presented. The method, that combines molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemistry
calculations and statistical mechanical modeling, is demonstrated by calculating the absorption and circular
dichroism spectra of the B800-B850 bacteriochlorophylls of the LH2 antenna complex from Rs. molischianum
at room temperature. The calculated spectra are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental
results. The calculations reveal that the broadening of the B800 band is mainly caused by the interactions with
the polar protein environment, while the broadening of the B850 band is due to the excitonic interactions. Since
it contains no ﬁtting parameters, in principle, the proposed method can be used to predict optical spectra of
arbitrary pigment-protein complexes of known structure.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Pigment-protein complexes (PPCs) play an important role
in photosynthetically active biological systems and have been
the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies1.
In a PPC the photoactive pigment molecules are held in well
deﬁned spatial conﬁguration and orientation by a scaffold of
proteins. The availability of high resolution crystal struc-
ture for a continuously growing number of PPCs provides
a unique opportunity in better understanding their properties
and function at atomic level. The spectral and optical prop-
erties of PPCs are determined by (i) the chemical nature of
the pigment, (ii) the electronic interactions between the pig-
ment molecules, and (iii) the interactions between pigment
molecules and their environment (e.g., protein, lipid, solvent).
Since in biological systems PPCs exist and function at physio-
logical temperature their electronic and optical properties are
strongly affected by thermal ﬂuctuations which represent the
main source of dynamic disorder in these systems.

Unfortunately, even in the simplest theoretical models of
PPCs the simultaneous treatment of the electronic coupling
between the pigments and the effect of thermal disorder can
be done only approximately2,3,4,5. The purpose of this paper
is to formulate and implement an efﬁcient method for calcu-
lating spectral and optical properties, e.g., linear absorption
(OD) and circular dichroism (CD) spectra of PPCs at ﬁnite
temperature by using only atomic structure information. To
demonstrate its usefulness, we apply the proposed method to
calculate the OD and CD spectra at room temperature of the
aggregate of bacteriochlorophyll-a (BChl-a) molecules in the
LH2 antenna complex from the purple bacterium Rs. molischi-
anum. Following their crystal structure determination, LH2
complexes from Rs. molischianum6 and Rsp. acidophila7 have
been extensively studied both experimentally8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15

and theoretically8,9,10,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. In Rs. molischianum
the LH2 is an octamer of ab
-heterodimers arranged in a ring-
like structure24,25. Each protomer consists of an a - and a b -
apoprotein which binds non-covalently one BChl-a molecule
that absorbs at 800 nm (referred to as B800), two BChl-a
molecules that absorb at 850 nm (referred to as B850) and
at least one carotenoid that absorbs around 500 nm. The
total of 16 B850 and 8 B800 BChls form two circular ag-
gregates, both oriented parallel to the surface of the mem-
brane. The excitonic coupling between the B800s is negligi-
ble because of their large spatial separation (∼ 22 ˚A). There-
fore, the optically active Qy excited electronic states of the
B800s are almost degenerate. On the other hand, the tightly
packed B850s (with and average Mg−Mg distance of ∼ 9.2 ˚A
within the ab −heterodimer and ∼ 8.9 ˚A between the neigh-
boring protomers) are strongly coupled and the corresponding
Qy excited states form an excitonic band in which the states
that carry most of the oscillator strength are clustered about
∼ 850 nm (1.46 eV). Another important difference between
the two BChl rings is that while the B800s are surrounded by
mostly hydrophilic protein residues the binding pocket of the
B850s is predominantly hydrophobic.6 Thus, although both
B800s and B850s are chemically identical BChl-a molecules
their speciﬁc spatial arrangement and the nature of their im-
mediate protein surrounding alter differently their spectral and
optical properties. For example, it is quite surprising that the
two peaks, due to the B800 and B850 BChls, in the experi-
mental OD spectrum of LH2 from Rs. molischianum at room
temperature19,26 have comparable widths although, as men-
tioned above, the B800 levels are almost degenerate while the
B850 levels form a ∼ 0.2 eV wide excitonic band.

Clearly, novel methods for calculating optical spectra of
PPCs by using computer simulations based entirely on the
atomic structure of the system would not only provide a better
understanding and interpretation of the existing experimental
results but would also help in predicting and designing new
experiments. The standard procedure to simulate the exper-
imental spectra of LH2 systems (and PPCs in general) con-
sists of two steps3,4,27. First, the excitation energy spectrum

is determined based on the static crystal structure of the sys-
tem and, second, the corresponding stick spectrum is “dressed
up” with simulated Gaussian (in case of static disorder) and/or
Lorentzian (in case of dynamic disorder) line widths char-
acterized by empirically (and often self consistently) deter-
mined parameters. Alternatively, the spectral broadening of
the stick spectrum can also be described through the coupling
of the electronic excitations (modeled as two- or multilevel-
systems) to a stochastic heat bath characterized by a model
spectral density with empirical parameters. While either ap-
proach may yield excellent agreement between the simulated
and experimental spectra, the empirical nature of the model
parameters restricts their predictive power.

Our proposed method for calculating optical spectra is
based on a combination of all atom molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, quantum chemistry (QC) calculations, and quan-
tum many-body theory. The conformational dynamics of the
LH2 ring embedded into its natural environment (a fully sol-
vated lipid bilayer) are followed by means of classical MD
simulations. Next, for each BChl, modeled as a quantum
two level system, the Qy excitation energy gap and transition
dipole moment time series are determined along a properly
chosen segment of the MD trajectory by means of QC cal-
culations. Finally, the OD and CD spectra are determined
as weighted sums of the Fourier transform of the quantum
dipole-dipole correlation function (i.e., the absorption line-
shape function) which, within the cumulant approximation,
can be calculated from the sole knowledge of the energy gap
time series. Formally, this method can also be regarded as a
two step procedure. First, a stick spectrum is generated from
the average values of the energy gap time series and, second,
spectral broadening is applied through the corresponding line-
shape function weighted by the mean transition dipole (rota-
tional) strength in the case of OD (CD) spectrum. Since both
the peak position and the broadening of the optical spectrum
are obtained from the same energy gap time series determined
from combined MD/QC calculations, the proposed method re-
quires no empirical ﬁtting parameters making it ideal for pre-
dicting optical spectra for PPCs with known structure. Similar
MD/QC methods were used previously by Mercer et al. 28 for
calculating the OD spectrum of BChl-a in methanol, and by
Damjanovic et al. 16 to determine the OD and CD spectra of
B850s in LH2 from Rs. molischianum. The relationship be-
tween these studies and the present one will be established
below.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. The
theoretical background of the proposed method for calculat-
ing optical spectra of PPCs is presented in Sec. II. The em-
ployed MC simulations and QC calculations are described in
Sec. III. The obtained results and their discussion is contained
in Sec. IV. Finally, Sec. V is reserved for conclusions.

II. THEORY

In order to calculate the linear optical absorption of a PPC
we assume that the electronic properties of individual pigment
molecules can be described in terms of a two-level system,

2

formed by the ground state and the lowest excited singlet state
(e.g., the Qy state in the case of BChl-a) involved in the opti-
cal absorption process. Neglecting for the moment the direct
interaction between the pigments (e.g., by assuming a sufﬁ-
ciently large spatial separation between them as in the case of
the B800s in LH2), we denote these two states for the nth pig-
ment (n = 1, . . . N) as |0i ≡ |0ni and |ni ≡ |1ni, respectively.
Once the interaction between the pigment and its environment
(composed of protein matrix, lipid membrane and solvent
molecules) is taken into account these two levels turn into, still
well separated, energy bands |0; l 0i = |0i|l 0i and |n; l ni =
|ni|l ni, where the quantum numbers l 0 and l n specify the
state of the nth pigment on the ground- and excited-state po-
tential energy surface, respectively. Because the exact quan-
tum mechanical treatment of the eigenstates |0; l 0i, |n; l ni
and of the corresponding energy eigenvalues E0,l 0, En,l n is
not feasible, usually the quantum numbers l 0 and l n are asso-
ciated with the vibronic states of the PPC that can be treated
within the harmonic approximation. Here we follow a differ-
ent approach in which the dynamics of the nuclear degrees
of freedom of the PPC are described by all-atom MD simula-
tions, and the energy gap time series D En(t) = En(t) − E0(t)
is calculated at each MD time step by QC calculations as de-
scribed below. The main assumption of this approach is that
the obtained energy gap time series D En(t) can be used to cal-
culate approximately equilibrium quantities (such as energy
gap density of states and time autocorrelation functions) of
the original system without the knowledge of the exact energy
gap spectrum D En,l n,l 0 = En,l n − E0,l 0.

In the absence of the excitonic coupling between the pig-
ment molecules, the Hamiltonian of the system can be written
as H = H0 + H, where
H0 = (cid:229)

where the transition dipole moment (TDM) matrix element
dn,l n,l 0 in the Condon approximation4 can be written

dn,l n,l 0 ≈ dnhl n|l 0i.

(2b)

Here dn = h1| ˆµn|0i is the real TDM vector whose time series
can be determined from the same combined MD/QC calcu-
lations as D En(t). Note that while h1|0i = 0, in general the
Franck-Condon factors hl n|l 0i are ﬁnite4.

When the size of the PPC is much smaller than the wave-
length of the light ﬁeld, in leading approximation the latter can
be regarded as homogeneous throughout the system and, ac-
cording to standard linear response theory, the corresponding

OD spectrum is proportional to the dipole-dipole correlation
function

The main difﬁculty in calculating the quantum time corre-
lation function in Eq. (5b) is due to the fact that the Hamilto-
nians H0 and Hn do not commute. If they would, then the line-
shape function could be expressed in terms of the energy gap
density of states (DOS). Indeed, in this case

hexp(−iD Hnt)i, with D Hn = Hn − H0, and by calculating the
time integral in Eq. (5b) would follow

tion. Indeed, the Fourier transform of the exact spectral repre-
sentation of the correlation function

Eqs. (6). Since it is not possible to determine all these fac-
tors, it is often convenient to use Eqs. (6) as a rough estimate
of An(w ) for calculating the OD spectrum.

A systematic way of calculating the correlation function in
(5b) is the cumulant expansion method. Here we employ the
second order cumulant approximation that is often used in op-
tical spectra calculations3. We have

A straightforward extension of the above method for calcu-

termination of the energies EJ,l J and TDMs dJ correspond-
ing to the excitonic states |J; l Ji, J = 1, . . . , N. Unfortunately,
the required QC calculations (by considering all N pigments
as a single quantum system) are still prohibitively expen-
sive computationally. Therefore, we employed an effective
Hamiltonian approximation for determining the time series
D EJ(t) = EJ(t) − E0(t) and dJ(t) from D En(t) and dn(t) of the
individual pigments. Assuming that these are coupled through

We note that by replacing the site index n with the excitonic
index J most of the above results for noninteracting pigments
remain formally valid for the corresponding excitonic system
as well. For example, similar expressions to (6) and (14) can
be easily derived for estimating AJ(w ).

To conclude this section we derive an expression for the CD
spectrum of the PPC. By deﬁnition, the CD spectrum ICD(w )
is the difference between IL(w ) and IR(w ), the OD spectra for
left and right circularly polarized light, respectively. Unlike in
the case of the OD spectrum, the calculation of ICD(w ) even
within the leading order approximation requires taking into
account the spatial variation of the light ﬁeld across the PPC as
well as the excitonic coupling between the pigment molecules
regardless how small this may be. The sensitivity of the CD
spectrum to geometrical and local details of the PPC makes
it a quantity difﬁcult to predict by theoretical modeling. The
CD spectrum is given by5

Note, that in the absence of the excitonic coupling all RJ = 0
(because for a given J only one coefﬁcient hJ|ni is nonzero)
and the CD spectrum vanishes. The rotational strength plays
the same role for the CD spectrum as the TDM strength for
the OD spectrum. Speciﬁcally, RJ gives the coupling between
the TDM of the excitonic state J and the orbital magnetic mo-
ment of the other excitons. The coupling to the local magnetic
moment is assumed to be small (Cotton effect) and usually is
discarded14,27.

III. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

In order to apply the results derived in Sec. II for calcu-
lating the OD and CD spectra of the B800 and B850 BChls
in a single LH2 ring from Rs. molischianum ﬁrst we need to
determine the time series of the Qy energy gap D En(ℓD
t) and
TDM dn(ℓD
t), ℓ = 0, 1, . . . , Nt , for all individual BChls. We
accomplish this in two steps. First, we use all atom MD simu-
lations to follow the dynamics of the nuclear degrees of free-
dom by recording snapshots of the atomic coordinates at times
tℓ = ℓD
t, and then use QC calculations to compute D En and dn
for each snapshot.

A. Molecular dynamics simulations

Here we provide a brief description of the simulated LH2
ring in its native environment as well as the employed MD
simulation protocol. A more detailed account or the reported
MD simulations can be found in Ref. 16. A perfect 8-fold LH2
ring was constructed starting from the crystal structure (pdb
code 1LGH) of Rs. molischianum6. After adding the missing
hydrogens, the protein system was embedded in a fully sol-
vated POPC lipid bilayer of hexagonal shape. Finally, a total
of 16 Cl− counterions were properly added to ensure elec-
troneutrality of the entire system of 87055 atoms. In order to
reduce the ﬁnite-size effects, the hexagonal unit cell (with side
length ∼ 60 ˚A, lipid bilayer thickness ∼ 42 ˚A and two water
layers of combined thickness ∼ 35 ˚A) was replicated in space
by using periodic boundary conditions. The CHARMM27
force ﬁeld parameters for proteins33,34 and lipids35 were used.
Water molecules were modeled as TIP3P36. The force ﬁeld
parameters for BChls and lycopenes were the ones used in
Ref. 16. After energy minimization, the system was subjected
to a 2 ns long equilibration in the NpT ensemble37 at normal
temperature (T = 300 K) and pressure (p = 1 atm), using peri-
odic boundary conditions and treating the full long-range elec-
trostatic interactions by the PME method38. All MD simula-
tions were preformed with the program NAMD 2.539, with a
performance of ∼ 8.5 days/ns on 24 CPUs of an AMD 1800+
Beowulf cluster. During equilibration an integration time step
of 2 fs was employed by using the SHAKE constraint on all
hydrogen atoms40. After the 2 ns equilibration a 1 ps produc-
tion run with 1 fs integration step was carried out with atomic
coordinates saved every other timestep, resulting in Nt = 500
MD snapshots with D
t = 2 fs time separation. These conﬁg-
uration snapshots were used as input for the QC calculations
described below.

B. Quantum chemistry calculations

The time series of the Qy transition energies D En and dipole
moments dn of individual BChls can be determined only ap-
proximately from the conﬁguration snapshots obtained from
MD simulations. The level of approximation used is deter-
mined by: (i) the actual deﬁnition of the optically active quan-
tum system, i.e., the part of the system that is responsible for
light absorption and needs to be treated quantum mechani-
cally; (ii) the actual choice of the QC method used in the cal-
culations; and (iii) the particular way in which the effect of the
(classical) environment on the quantum system is taken into
account in the QC calculations. Because the optical properties
of BChls are determined by the cyclic conjugated p -electron
system of the macrocycle the quantum system was restricted
to a truncated structure of the BChl-a containing 49 atoms in
the porphyrin plane. The truncation consisted in removing the
phytyl tail and in replacing the terminal CH3 and CH2CH3
groups on the macrocycle with H atoms in order to satisfy
valence requirements. Similar truncation schemes have been
employed previously28,41. In these studies the phytyl tail of
the BChls was removed but the number of atoms retained in

FIG. 1: Normalized DOS, N (w ), for (a) B800, and (b) B850 BChls
in LH2 of Rs. Molischianum computed as binned histograms of the
corresponding Qy excitation energy time series obtained from com-
bined MD/QC simulations. Whether the charge ﬂuctuations of the
BChls’ environment are included (solid lines) or not (dashed line)
makes an important difference in N (w ) only for B800. In (b) the
DOS of the B850 excitons is shown as a thick solid line.

the optically active macrocycle was different. For example,
Cory et al. 41 in calculating the excited states of the B800 oc-
tamer and the B850 hexadecamer of LH2 from Rs. molischi-
anum used 44 macrocycle atoms, while Mercer et al. 28 in cal-
culating the absorption spectrum of BChl-a in ethanol used 84
atoms. According to the crystal structure6, the B800 and B850
BChls in LH2 from Rs. molischianum differ only in the length
of their phytyl chain, having a total of 107 and 140 atoms,
respectively. The removal of the phytyl tail reduces dramati-
cally both the size of the quantum system and the correspond-
ing QC computational time. Furthermore, for the truncated
BChls the non trivial task of automatic identiﬁcation of the
Qy excited state in the case of a large number of such compu-
tations becomes easier and more precise. Although in general
the different truncation schemes yield excitation energy time
series with somewhat different (shifted) mean values, the cor-
responding energy ﬂuctuations, which play the chief role in
calculating the optical absorption properties of PPC at room
temperature in their native environment, are less sensitive to
the actual size of the truncated pigment.

The Qy excitations of the truncated BChls were calcu-
lated by using Zerner’s semiempirical intermediate neglect
of differential overlap method parametrized for spectroscopy
(ZINDO/S) within the single-point conﬁguration interaction
singles (CIS) approximation42,43. Because it is much faster
and more accurate than most of the computationally afford-
able ab initio QC methods (e.g., the Hartree-Fock (HF) CIS
method with the minimal STO-3G∗ basis set), ZINDO/S
CIS has been extensively used in the literature to com-
pute low lying optically allowed excited states of pigment
molecules19,20,44,45. In cases like ours, where thousands of QC

calculations are required, the proper balancing between speed
and accuracy is absolutely essential. To further increase the
computational speed, the active orbital space for the CIS cal-
culations was restricted to the ten highest occupied (HOMO)
and the ten lowest unoccupied (LUMO) molecular orbitals.
According to previous studies28, as well as our own testings,
the choice of a larger active space has negligible effect on the
computed Qy states. Our ZINDO/S calculations were carried
out with the QC program packages HyperChem46 and GAUS-
SIAN 9847. In each calculation only the lowest four excited
states were determined. Only in a small fraction (< 5%) of
cases was the indentiﬁcation of the Qy excited state (charac-
terized by the largest oscillator strength and corresponding
to transitions HOMO→LUMO and HOMO-1→LUMO+1)
problematic requiring careful inspection. We have found that
even in such cases the Qy state had the largest projection of the
TDM along the y-axis, determined by the NB and ND nitrogen
atoms.

The effect of the environment on the quantum system was
taken into account through the electric ﬁeld created by the par-
tial point charges of the environment atoms, including those
BChl atoms that were removed during the truncation process.
Thus, the dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom (de-
scribed by MD simulation) have a two-fold effect on the ﬂuc-
tuations of the Qy state, namely they lead to: (1) conforma-
tional ﬂuctuation of the (truncated) BChls, and (2) a ﬂuctu-
ating electric ﬁeld created by the thermal motion of the cor-
responding atomic partial charges. In order to assess the rel-
ative importance of these two effects the time series D En(t)
were calculated both in the the presence and in the absence
of the point charges. Since the ZINDO/S implementation in
GAUSSIAN 98 does not work in the presence of external
point charges, these calculations were done with HyperChem.
The ZINDO/S calculations without point charges were car-
ried out with both QC programs and yielded essentially the
same result. For each case, we have performed a total of
12,000 (500 snapshots × 24 BChls) ZINDO/S calculations.
On a workstation with dual 3GHz Xeon EM64T CPU it took
∼ 2.3 min/CPU for each calculation with point charges, and
only ∼ 0.7 min/CPU without point charges. Thus, on a clus-
ter of ﬁve such workstations, all 24,000 ZINDO/S runs were

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

t; ℓ = 0, . . . , Nt ; Nt = 499; D

The time series of the Qy excitation energies D En(tℓ) and
TDMs dn(tℓ), (tℓ = ℓD
t = 2 fs),
were computed with the ZINDO/S CIS method, described
in Sec. III B, for both B850 (n = 1, . . . , 16 ) and B800 (n =
17, . . . , 24) BChls in a LH2 ring from Rs. molischianum, us-
ing snapshots from the all atom MD simulation described in
Sec. III A. The calculations were done both with and with-
out the point charges of the atoms surrounding the truncated
BChls. The 1 ps long time series appear to be sufﬁciently
long for calculating the DOS of the Qy excitation energies and
the corresponding OD and CD spectra. In Ref. 28 it has been
found that at least a 2.2 ps long MD trajectory was needed
for proper evaluation of optical observables related to their
MD/QC calculations. However, our test calculations showed
no signiﬁcant difference between the energy gap autocorrela-
tion functions calculated from a 2 ps and a 1 ps long energy
gap time series. Therefore, to reduce the computational time
we have opted for the latter.

tively.

been applied to all subsequent lineshape and spectra calcula-
tions. In the absence of the point charge distribution of the
environment N (w ) for B800 and B850 (dashed lines) are al-
most identical, having peak position at 1.51 eV (817 nm) and
1.515 eV (818 nm), and full width at half maximum (FWHM)
51 meV and 59 meV, respectively. The fact that the peak po-
sition practically coincides with the mean energy gap is in-
dicative that the DOS is symmetric with respect to its maxi-
mum. It should be noted that essentially the same mean en-
ergy gap of 1.5 eV was obtained in similar MD/QC calcu-
lations (i) by us (data not shown) in the case of a truncated
BChl-a in vacuum but artiﬁcially coupled to a Langevin heat
bath at room temperature, and (ii) by Mercel et al.28 for a
BChl-a solvated in methanol also at room temperature. Al-
though in case (ii) the width of the DOS appears to be some-
what broader (FWHM≈ 65 eV) than in case (i), for which
FWHM≈ 58 meV, based on these results one can safely con-
clude that the thermal motion of the nuclei in individual BChls
lead to Qy energy gap ﬂuctuations that are insensitive to the
actual nature of the nonpolar environment. Since in LH2
from Rs. molischianum the surrounding of the B800s is po-
lar while that of the B850s is not, one expects that once the
point charges of the environment are taken into account in the
QC calculations N (w ) should change dramatically only in
the case of B800. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1b (solid line),
in the presence of the point charges the peak of NB850(w ) is
only slightly red shifted to 1.502 eV (825 nm) and essentially
without any change in shape with FWHM≈ 53 meV. By con-
trast, the DOS for B800 in the presence of the point charges
(Fig. 1a) has qualitatively changed. The induced higher en-
ergy ﬂuctuations not only spoil the symmetry of NB800(w )
but also increase dramatically its broadening, characterized
by FWHM≈ 100 meV. Thus, in spite of a small blueshift to
1.528 eV (811 nm) of the peak of NB800(w ) the mean value
of the energy gap hD EB800i = 1.556 eV (797 nm) is increased
considerably, matching rather well the experimental value of
800 nm.

FIG. 5: Spectral density function J(w) for B800 (dashed line) and
B850 (solid line) obtained according to Eq. (12).

The time series of the excitonic energies D EJ(tℓ), J =
1, . . . , 16, of the B850 BChls were determined by solving for
each MD snapshot, within the point-dipole approximation, the
eigenvalue equation (16). In calculating the matrix elements
(15) rn was identiﬁed with the position vector of the Mg atom
in the n-th BChl. Consistent with the Condon approximation,
the magnitude of the computed B850 TDM time series exhib-
ited a standard deviation of less than 4% about the average
value hdB850i = 11.77 D. The latter is by a factor of k = 1.87
larger than the experimentally accepted 6.3 D value of the Qy
TDM of BChl-a48. Thus, to account for this overestimate of
the TDM by the ZINDO/S CIS method, instead of using a
reasonable value of 1.86 for the relative dielectric constant of
the protein environment in Eq. (15) we set for all the calcula-
tions reported in this paper e r = 6.5 (= 1.86 × 1.872). Equiv-
alently, one can rescale all TDMs from the ZINDO/S calcu-
lations by the factor k−1 and set e r = 1.86. Either way the
mean value of the nearest neighbor dipolar coupling energies
between B850s were 27 meV≈ 220 cm−1 within a protomer
and 24 meV≈ 196 cm−1 between adjacent heterodimers. Just
like in the case of individual BChls, the DOS corresponding
to the B850 excitonic energies (Fig. 1b - thick line) was cal-
culated as a binned histogram of D EJ(tℓ). As expected, the
excitonic DOS is not sensitive to whether the point charges of
the environment are included or not in the B850 site energy
calculations.

The mean excitonic TDMs, calculated from Eq. (17) and
expressed in terms of hdB850i, are shown in Fig. 2. The er-
ror bars represent the standard deviation of the time series
dJ(tℓ). In agreement with previous studies, most of the dipole
strength is amassed into the lowest three excitonic states.

As discussed in Sec. II, a rough estimate of the lineshape
function can be obtained as the combined DOS of the B800
BChls and B850 excitons. In this approximation the OD spec-
trum reads

blueshifted by 20 eV (solid line) in order to match the
B850 peak position with the one in the experimental OD
spectrum19,26 (dashed line). While the B850 band and the rel-
ative heights of the two peaks in IDOS(w ) match rather well
the experimental data, the position and the broadening of the
B800 peak do not. This result clearly shows that in general
peak positions in optical spectra may be shifted from the cor-
responding peak positions in the excitation energy spectrum
due to correlation effects between the ground and optically
active excited states. The latter may also lead to different line
broadening of the corresponding peaks. Thus, it appears that
in principle, methods for simulating optical spectra in which
the position of the peaks are identiﬁed with the computed ex-
citation energies (stick spectrum) are not entirely correct and
using instead more sophisticated methods that include quan-
tum correlation effects should be preferred. Such method,
based on the cumulant approximation of the lineshape func-
tion as described in Sec. II, is used in the next section for
calculating the OD spectrum of an LH2 ring from Rs. molis-
chianum.

B. Absorption (OD) spectrum

The key quantity for calculating the lineshape functions of
the individual B850 and B800 BChls is the (classical) auto-
correlation function Cn(t) = hd En(t)d En(0)i of the energy
gap ﬂuctuation d En(t) = D En(t) − hD Eni determined from
the combined MD/QC calculations. Because the time series
D En(t) were too short for a proper evaluation of the ensemble
average in the individual Cn(t), a single time correlation func-
tion CB800(t) [CB850(t)] was determined by averaging over all

The normalized correlation functions Ca (t)/Ca (0),

the variance of the energy gap ﬂuctuations with CB800(0) =
3.16 × 10−3 eV2 and CB850(0) = 8.68 × 10−4 eV2. The be-
havior of the two correlation functions is rather similar during
the ﬁrst 150 fs. Following a sharp decay to negative values
in the ﬁrst 9 fs, both functions exhibit an oscillatory compo-
nent of approximately 18.5 fs period and uneven amplitudes
that, in general, are larger for the B800. After ∼ 150 fs, the
autocorrelation functions behave in a distinctive manner, both
becoming negligibly small for t & 400 fs.

The spectral densities Ja (w ) for B800 and B850, deter-
mined according to Eq. (12), are shown in Fig. 5. The promi-
nent peak about w p = 0.22 eV is due to the fast initial decay
of Ca (t). Being reported in previous studies16,28, by using
both ab initio (HF/CIS with STO-3G∗ basis set) and semi em-
pirical QC methods, these spectral features appear to be in-
trinsic properties of BChl-a, most likely originating from a
strong coupling of the pigment to an intramolecular C=O vi-
bronic mode. Often, the environment in a PPC is modeled as
an equivalent harmonic (phonon) heat bath for which the cu-
mulant approximation is exact3. The corresponding phonon
spectral density can be written as J(w ) = w 2 (cid:229)

Thus, one can interpret the magnitude of the spectral functions
in Fig. 5 as a measure of the coupling strength to phonons of
that particular frequency. The complex structure of the spec-
tral functions indicate that all inter and intra molecular vi-
bronic modes with frequency below w p will contribute to the
lineshape function. Hence, attempts to use simpliﬁed model
spectral functions appear to be unrealistic even if these may

The lineshape functions of individual B800 and B850, cal-
culated from Eqs. (14), are plotted in Fig. 6. The origin of the
frequency axis corresponds to the mean energy gaps w B800 and
w B850, respectively. The highly polarized surrounding of the
B800 BChls in Rs. molischianum renders AB800(w ) twice as
broad (FWHM≈ 26 meV) as AB850(w ) (FWHM≈ 13 meV).
Also, the redshift of the peak of the former (D
w ≈ 25 meV)
is more than three times larger than that of the latter (D
w ≈
7 meV).

Since the available simulation data is not sufﬁcient to prop-
erly estimate the excitonic lineshape functions AJ(w ), by ne-
glecting the effect of exchange narrowing14,27, we approxi-
mated these with AB850(w ). Thus, the OD spectrum of the
LH2 BChls was calculated by using the formula

where w J = hD EJi.

As shown in Fig. 7, after an overall blueshift of 20 meV,
I(w ) matches remarkably well the experimental OD spectrum,
especially if we take into account that it was obtained from the
sole knowledge of the high resolution crystal structure of LH2
from Rs. molischianum. The reason why both B800 and B850
peaks of I(w ) are somewhat narrower than the experimental
ones is most likely due to the fact that the effect of static dis-
order is ignored in the present study. Indeed, our calculations
were based on a single LH2 ring, while the experimental data
is averaged over a large number of such rings. While compu-
tationally expensive, in principle, the effect of static disorder
could be taken into account by repeating the above calcula-
tions for different initial conﬁgurations of the LH2 ring and
then averaging the corresponding OD spectra.

To conclude this section we would like to relate the present
work to previous two combined MD/QC studies16,28. In Mer-
cer et al. 28 it is argued that the ab initio QC method (HF/CIS
with the STO-3G∗ basis set) should be preferred to semi em-

pirical methods for calculating optical spectra because it re-
produces better their experimental results. The FWHM of
their calculated semi empirical and ab initio absorption spec-
tra of BChl-a in methanol are ∼ 65 meV and ∼ 125 meV,
respectively. These values are similar to the ones we obtained
for the same type of calculations for BChl-a in vacuum and
in LH2 embedded in its native environment. Since except
Ref. 28 all experimental results on the Qy absorption band
of BChls we are aware of have a FWHM of . 80 meV at
room temperature, we conclude that in fact the semi empiri-
cal ZINDO/S method should be preferable to the ab initio QC
method. In general, the latter overestimate the broadening of
the OD spectrum by a factor of 2 to 3. In Damjanovic et al. 16,
the OD spectrum of individual B850s (i.e., without excitonic
coupling) calculated with the ab initio method yielded the
same FWHM of ∼ 125 meV as in Mercer et al. 28. Once
the excitonic coupling was included within the framework of
a polaron model, and it was assumed that the entire oscilla-
tor strength was carried by a single exciton level of a perfect
B850 ring, the FWHM of the resulting OD spectrum was re-
duced to ∼ 43 meV as a result of exchange narrowing. Thus
the obtained OD spectrum for the B850s appeared to match
rather well the corresponding part of the experimental one.
However, by applying the same method to the B800s, where
there is no exchange narrowing, the polar environment fur-
ther broadens the corresponding OD spectrum to a FWHM of
∼ 250 meV that is clearly unphysically large. Thus, the con-
clusion again is that the ZINDO/S CIS semi empirical method
should be preferred for calculating optical spectra of PPCs.

C. Circular dichroism (CD) spectrum

The CD spectrum of the LH2 BChls from Rs. molischi-
anum was determined by following the theoretical approach
described at the end of Sec. II and by employing the same
time series (obtained from the combined MD/QC calcula-
tions) used for calculating the OD spectrum.

First, the rotational strength of both B850 excitons and
B800 BChls were determined by using Eq. (22b). In this equa-
tion, just like in the case of the point-dipole interaction matrix
elements (15), the vector rn described the position of the Mg
atom in the nth BChl. As already clariﬁed in Sec. II the cal-
culation of the rotational strength of the B800 BChls requires
solving the corresponding excitonic Hamiltonian (16) regard-
less of how small the dipole-dipole coupling is between these
BChls. The calculation does not yield either noticeable cor-
rections to the B800 excitation energies or admixture of the
corresponding Qy states, however, it leads to sizable mean ro-
tational strengths as shown in Fig. 8 (ﬁlled circles). Similarly
to the TDM strengths (Fig. 2), the largest (negative) mean ro-
tational strengths are carried by the four lowest B850 exci-
tonic states as shown in Fig. 8 (open squares). The second
highest excitonic state also has a sizable rotational strength
and is responsible for enhancing the positive peak of the B800
contribution to the CD spectrum (Fig. 9a).

Second, the CD spectrum is calculated from Eq. (22a)
where the summation index J runs over all B850 and
B800 excitonic states and AJ(w ) = Aa (w − w J), with a ∈
{B850, B800}. Figure 9a shows the CD spectrum contribu-
tion by the B850 (solid line) and B800 (dashed line). Both
contributions have the same qualitative structure with increas-
ing energy: a pronounced negative peak followed by a smaller
positive one. The B850 negative CD peak is about twice as
large as the corresponding B800 peak. The total CD spec-
trum, given by the superposition of the B850 and B800 con-
tributions, is shown in Fig. 9b (solid line) and matches fairly
well the experimental spectrum19 (dashed line). It should be
emphasized that apart from an overall scaling factor the CD
spectrum was calculated from the same MD/QC data as the
OD spectrum by following the procedure described above.

the LH2 ring from Rs. molischianum the OD and CD spec-
tra of this PPC can be predicted with reasonable accuracy
at affordable computational costs. The conﬁguration snap-
shots taken with femtosecond frequency during the MD sim-
ulation of the PPC in its native, fully solvated lipid-membrane
environment at room temperature and normal pressure pro-
vide the necessary input for the QC calculations of the opti-
cal excitation energies and transition dipole moments of the
pigment molecules. The obtained time series are used to
evaluate within the second cumulant approximation the op-
tical lineshape functions as the Fourier transform of the quan-
tum dipole-dipole correlation function. Our choice of the
ZINDO/S CIS method for the QC calculations was motivated
by the fact that it is almost two orders of magnitude faster and
much more accurate than the most affordable ab initio method
(HF/CIS with the STO-3G∗ basis set). Compared to the for-
mer, the latter method overestimates by a factor of 2 to 3 both
the excitation energies and the broadening of the energy spec-
trum. Just like in several previous studies19,20,44,45, we have
found that the ZINDO/S method repeatedly yields results in
good agreement with existing experimental data.

By investigating the excitation energy spectrum of the LH2
BChls both in the presence and in the absence of the atomic
partial charges of their environment we have convincingly
demonstrated that the large broadening of the B800 peak is
due primarily to the electric ﬁeld ﬂuctuations created by the
polar surrounding environment of the B800s. There is no
such effect for the B850s which sit in a nonpolar local en-
vironment. The broadening of the B850 peak is due to the
sizable excitonic coupling between these BChls. Since only
the lowest three excitonic states carry most of the available
dipole strength, in spite of the ∼ 0.2 eV wide excitonic band,
the B850 absorption peak has a FWHM only slightly larger
than the B800 one.

It is rather remarkable that both the OD and the CD spec-
tra of the considered LH2 complex are fairly well predicted
by our combined MD/QC method. However, a more thor-
ough testing of the proposed method, involving other PPCs is
necessary to fully establish its capability of predicting optical
properties by using only atomic structure information.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Acknowledgments

The continuous increase in processor power and availabil-
ity of high performance computer clusters, along with the
growing number of high resolution crystal structures of mem-
brane bound pigment-protein complexes make feasible the
theoretical characterization of the spectral and optical proper-
ties of such systems at atomic level. By applying an approach
that combines all atom MD simulations, efﬁcient semi em-
pirical QC calculations and quantum many-body theory we
have shown that starting solely from the atomic structure of

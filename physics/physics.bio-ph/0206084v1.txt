Nucleosome repositioning via loop formation

I.M. Kuli´c and H. Schiessel

(Dated: January 10, 2014)

Active (catalysed) and passive (intrinsic) nucleosome repositioning is known to be a crucial event
during the transcriptional activation of certain eucaryotic genes. Here we consider theoretically
the intrinsic mechanism and study in detail the energetics and dynamics of DNA-loop-mediated
nucleosome repositioning, as previously proposed by Schiessel et al. (H. Schiessel, J. Widom, R. F.
Bruinsma, and W. M. Gelbart. 2001. Phys. Rev. Lett. 86:4414-4417). The surprising outcome
of the present study is the inherent nonlocality of nucleosome motion within this model – being
a direct physical consequence of the loop mechanism. On long enough DNA templates the longer
jumps dominate over the previously predicted local motion, a fact that contrasts simple diﬀusive
mechanisms considered before. The possible experimental outcome resulting from the considered
mechanism is predicted, discussed and compared to existing experimental ﬁndings.

INTRODUCTION

The nucleosome, the most abundant DNA-protein
complex in nature, is the basic unit of eucaryotic chro-
matin organization. It is roughly a cylinder of 6nm height
and 10nm diameter, consisting of a protein octamer core
and 147 basepairs (bp) of DNA tightly wrapped around
it in 1 and 3/4 left-handed superhelical turns. The genes
of all higher organisms, ranging from simple ones like
yeast to most elaborate like humans are all organized
in long arrays of nucleosomes with short DNA segments
(linkers) of 50-100 bp interpolating between them, com-
parable to a beads-on-a-string chain [1, 2, 3]. The higher
order organization of these units, being most probably a
solenoid- or zig-zag, crossed-linker- like ﬁber with 30 nm
diameter is still under great dispute though it received in-
creasing theoretical and experimental support in recent
years. Above that scale of organization, the higher or-
der structures which link the 30 nm to the ﬁnal ”big X”
like structure, the packed chromosome, are still unknown.
Though there are several biologically motivated specula-
tions about the ”big X” its deﬁnite structure remained a
long lasting puzzle for the last 20 years, defying all bio-

FIG. 1: The basic problem setting: how does the histone-
octamer move along the DNA template? Below: the DNA
loop mechanism as proposed in in Ref. [10]

physical, biochemical and molecular genetics eﬀorts to
resolve it because of its intrinsic softness and fuzziness.

An additional obstacle for understanding the chro-
matin structure is the fact that it is highly dynamic on
all organization scales. Starting at the macroscopic chro-
mosome level we see that its structure can strongly vary
throughout the cell cycle on timescales of hours or days.
Below that on timescales of seconds and minutes, the
structure of the 30 nm ﬁber itself is subjected to great
variations due to transcription, replication, biochemical
modiﬁcation and other dynamic processes. Finally, at the
lowest organization level, the nucleosome itself has been
shown to be a dynamical structure being moved along the
DNA by chromatin remodeling complexes on expense of
ATP [4, 5]. Interestingly, it was experimentally observed
[6, 7, 8, 9] that nucleosomes can move even autonomously
on short DNA segments. This intrinsic repositioning be-
havior was shown to be strongly temperature dependent.
At room temperature it occurs roughly on timescales of
1 hour indicating the existence of signiﬁcant energetic
∼
barriers. Besides the fact that the repositioning does
indeed occur and is of intramolecular nature (the nucle-
osome stays on the same DNA segment) the underlying
scenario could not be ﬁgured out. It was speculated by
Pennings et. al.
[8, 9] that the mechanism was some
type of nucleosome-sliding or screwing motion. An alter-
native explanation which appears to be more consistent
with the discrete jumps and large barriers observed by
Pennings et. al. has been recently proposed in Ref. [10].
In this model the basic step in the repositioning process is
a partial unwrapping of DNA from the very ends of the
nucleosome [11, 12] followed by a backfolding of DNA
with a small 10 bp mismatch (cf. Fig. 1). The result of
this process is the formation of a small DNA bulge or loop
on the octamer surface. Once trapped on the nucleosome
surface this small defect carrying some discrete quantum
of DNA extra length (a multiple of 10 bp, the DNA re-
peat length) can propagate by diﬀusion in both direc-
tions. If the loop happens to surround the nucleosome
and comes out at the opposite side (in respect to where it

was created) the nucleosome is eventually repositioned by
a distance given by the ”pulled in” extra length. The en-
ergetic barrier and rates of repositioning were computed
and were shown to be consistent with the Pennings et
al. experiment [8, 9]. Moreover, the 10 bp discrete step
repositioning observed in the experiment (discrete bands,
no 1 bp spaced intermediates) came out as a natural con-
sequence of the loop length quantization. The latter is
enforced by the strongly preferred DNA minor groove -
octamer interaction and the discrete binding sites at the
nucleosome surface as deduced from the crystallographic
structures [14].

∼

In Ref. [10] small loops with short excess length of typ-
ically
10 bp were considered and it was shown
that the looping energies involved increase rapidly with
the excess length implying that only the shortest (10 bp)
loop contributes signiﬁcantly to the repositioning mech-
anism. Consequently the model predicts a classical dis-
crete random walk with a jump-size of 10 bp – instead
of a 1 bp motion that would be implied by sliding/cork-
screwing mechanism. Apart from the discrepancy in the
elementary step size, both models predict very similar
behavior: a local one-dimensional diﬀusive motion along
the DNA chain.

In this paper we will carefully reanalyze the idea of
loop-mediated repositioning by applying the classical tool
of the Kirchhoﬀ kinetic analogy which provides us with
analytic solutions of the loop problem and enables us to
look at loops of virtually any given excess length. The
main outcome of our study will be a diﬀerent picture of
repositioning which physically results from the looping
mechanism: on short up to moderately long segments of
lP (lP : DNA persistence length) the repo-
up to 2-3
sitioning is a jumpy process with largest possible loops
being the most dominant ones in contrast to short 10 bp
steps as conjectured before. For longer and very long
(inﬁnite) DNA segments there is an optimal jump size of
O(lp) and the behavior is superdiﬀusive in con-
order
trast to the previously predicted diﬀusive mechanism. As
we will see below, these predictions allow us to clearly
distinguish between diﬀerent repositioning mechanisms
in experiments expected to be performed in near future
[13].

II. ENERGETICS OF LOOPS

Let us now consider the energetics of an intranucleoso-
mal DNA loop. We will describe it within the framework
of the Euler-Kirchhoﬀ theory for the static equilibrium of
rods (Fig. 2). For simplicity and because of the approxi-
mate planarity of the problem we can in ﬁrst approxima-
tion assume the nucleosome and the loop-forming DNA
to be in one plane and the DNA to be free of any twisting
deformation. It this case the free energy of our system
is simply divided into two components, the planar elastic
DNA-bending and a histone-octamer DNA interaction:

Utot = Ubend + Uads

FIG. 2: The Kirchhoﬀ kinetic analogy between the spinning
top and the bent/twisted rod depicted for a special case: the
plane pendulum - planar rod equivalence. The inset shows
how an intranucleosomal loop can be constructed by inscrib-
ing the octamer (gray disk) into the bent rod. The nucleosome
opening angle 2α accounts for the adsorption energy cost (see
text for details).

The bending energy (within the linear elasticity approx-
imation) can be written in terms of the local DNA cur-
vature κ

by its contour length parameter s ranging from

L/2 with L being the total length of the loop. The latter
can be expressed in terms of two independent quantities:
the excess length ∆L and the nucleosome opening angle

L (α, ∆L) = 2αR + ∆L

where R
4 nm is the eﬀective nucleosome radius, or
more precisely the distance from the center of the nucle-
osome to the central DNA axis. Because the DNA can
enter the nucleosome only in quantized orientations (with
its minor groove phosphates) and bind only to discrete
positions on the protein surface [14], the excess length
∆L = n
hDN A is to a good approximation an integer
multiple of the DNA repeat length hDN A = 3.4nm.

×

The second part in the total energy Eq. 1 Uads comes
from the (predominantly electrostatic) interaction be-
tween the positively charged protein surface and the neg-
atively charged DNA. It can be roughly measured from
experiments probing the competitive protein binding to
nucleosomal DNA [11, 12]. Neglecting the discreteness of
charges (binding sites) on the histone octamer surface it
can in ﬁrst approximation be assumed to be proportional

to the opening angle α and the adsorption energy density

by two Lagrange multipliers µ1/2. We then arrive at the
following lengthy functional

A. Ground states of trapped loops

In order to compute the ground state for a trapped
intranucleosomal loop we have to consider shapes that
minimize the total energy 1 under two constraints:

1. The excess length ∆L is prescribed. Therefore we
have the relation Eq. 3 between the opening angle
and the total loop length L

∆L = L

2αR = const.

2. At the two ends s± =

Here x (s) and y (s) are the Cartesian coordinates of
the rod axis as a function of the arc-length parameter s
(cf. Fig. 2). The absolute value in the second constraint
needs to be introduced formally for dealing with crossed
rod solutions (which we consider later on) and can be
omitted for simple uncrossed loops.

For an analytical description it is convenient to use the
angle θ = θ (s) between the DNA tangent and the y axis
(cf. Fig. 2) as a variable describing the DNA centerline.
In this case the integrated sine (cosine) of θ over the arc-
length parameter s gives the x (y) Cartesian coordinate of
any point along the rod, and the squared derivative (θ′)2
gives the rod curvature κ. Furthermore the nucleosome
opening angle α is simply related to θ at the boundary

(contact interaction) which is justiﬁed by the very short Debye
screening length of ≈ 1nm under physiological salt conditions.

on one side.

Here b.t. denotes the boundary terms (depending on

variation inside the relevant s interval. The integral in
Eq.8 is evidently analogous to the action integral of the
plane pendulum with A (θ′)2 corresponding to the kinetic
and
µ2 cos θ to the potential energy of the pendulum.
The latter analogy is a rather unspectacular observation
knowing the celebrated Kirchhoﬀ’s kinetic mapping be-
tween deformed rods and the spinning top, which con-
tains our present problem as a simple special case. The
Kirchhoﬀ’s analogy states that the equilibrium confor-
mations of (weakly) deformed thin rods can be mapped
to the time-dynamics of a heavy symmetric spinning top
subjected to a gravitational force. It has been repeatedly
applied (with or without direct reference to Kirchhoﬀ) to
DNA related problems during the last 20 years (e.g. see
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]). For a nice visual re-
view on the spinning top-elastic rod analogy the reader

The nice thing about Kirchhoﬀ’s analogy apart from
its esthetical content is that it provides us with explicit
expressions for DNA shapes subjected to twist, bend-
ing and various geometric / topological constraints. In
our simple planar and twistless case, the ”spinning top”
simply reduces to the simple plane pendulum. The corre-
sponding planar and twistless rods, also called the Euler
elastica, are most generally given by

diﬀerent rod shapes corresponding to diﬀerent solutions

case m = 0 describes a pendulum at rest correspond-
ing to a straight rod, for 0 < m < 1 one has strictly
oscillating pendulums corresponding to point symmetric
rod shapes which for m < 0. 92 are free of self inter-
sections like the one depicted in Fig. 2. For m higher
than 0. 92 the rods show varying complexity with a mul-
titude of self-intersections and for m = 1 one has the
so-called homoclinic pendulum orbit corresponding to a
rod solution having only one self intersection and becom-

with self-intersections lacking point symmetry. Finally,
the limiting case m

III. LOOP ZOOLOGY: SIMPLE AND CROSSED
LOOPS

×

−

We can scan now through the σ

m parameter plane
and look at the shapes of the solutions and their en-
ergies.
In Fig. 3 we see a small (but most important)
part of the whole parameter space and the correspond-
ing diﬀerent loop geometries. The dashed lines indicate
parameter values which lead to constant excess length
3.4nm (corresponding to 100 bps) in accor-
∆L = 10
dance with the constraint Eq. 16. The shapes 1-7 are
examples of 100bp-loops with diﬀerent geometries. The
whole parameter plane is subdivided by separation lines
(solid) into regions of structurally diﬀerent solutions.
The large region starting at σ = 0 contains exclusively
simple loops (like 1,2 and 3) without self-intersections
and nucleosome penetration. Above that simple-loop-
region we ﬁnd loops with a single self-intersection (4,5,6)
and to the right the loops penetrate the nucleosome, like
loop 10. There are also three other regions with single
and double crossing points (7,8,9) where the loop can also
be on the ”wrong” side of the nucleosome like in 7 and
8.

We are interested in the energy minimizing loops and
the underlying minimal energies as functions of the excess
length ∆L. A density plot of these energies as function

ones are simple (uncrossed) loops which we study ﬁrst.
Loops with larger excess length form crossed structures
and are studied in Section 3.2.

A. Simple Loops

×

For simple uncrossed loops it is a straightforward nu-
merical task to minimize Eq. 20 under the constraint of
constant excess length, Eq. 16. For εads = 0.7kBT /nm
and all the other parameters as above (A = 50nm
kBT,
R = 4nm) the ground state energy Umin as a func-
tion6 of the excess length ∆L is shown in Fig. 5 (for
∆L <
60nm; for longer ∆L-values crossed loops are more
∼
favorable as discussed in the next section). Remarkably
we ﬁnd that the loop energy is non-monotonous: For
small ∆L Umin increases with ∆L as (∆L)1/3 (in accor-
dance with Ref. [10] where only small loops were stud-
ied). At some critical excess length ∆L = ∆Lcrit (which
3.4nm for εads = 0.7
is approximately ∆Lcrit ≈
kBT /nm) the loop energy reaches a maximum (here
Umin(∆Lcrit)
26kBT ). Beyond that the energy de-
creases with increasing ∆L.

In the following we show how this behavior can be
explained on the basis of the loop geometry. Naively

6 Formally the quantisation condition ∆L = 1, 2, ... × 3.4nm holds
as mentioned above. Nevertheless for clarity we consider the
values in between as well.

is obviously absurd). The reason for this is that for very
small angles α (compared to ∆L) uncrossed7 circle-line
loops cannot exist for geometrical reasons. There this
most basic approximation breaks down and we would
have to approximate the loop by more than one circular
segment. But as mentioned above, such loops (α small
compared to ∆L) are not candidates for the ground state
O (1), and we therefore dispense
for moderate εads ∼
with giving a discussion of this case.

The nice thing about Eq. 22 is that despite its simplic-
ity and approximate nature it reproduces the position of
the maximum in Fig. 5 quite well. We ﬁnd the condi-
tion for the critical excess length ∆Lcrit from a simple
geometric distinction between two loop shapes: the sub-
critical loop (Fig. 6a) with its tangents not being parallel
to the Y axis (α = 0) and the supercritical loop (Fig. 6b)
having two or more tangents parallel to the line α = 0.
Suppose now we add excess length to a subcritical loop by
keeping the angle α = const. Obviously the loop-energy
increases because the loop radius r becomes smaller. On
the other hand in the supercritical case we have the oppo-
site situation: the loop energy decreases with increasing
∆L. This is simply because we could cut the loop at two
points (XL and XR in Fig. 6), introduce there the ad-
ditional length (without changing the energy) and then
relax the shape by letting it evolve to the new equilibrium
while keeping α = const. Thus we can obtain the con-
dition for the critical excess length ∆Lcrit by assuming
that the corresponding minimum αmin of Utot just crosses

7 In contrary for crossed loops there still are solutions for small α

(cf. next chapter).

FIG. 6: Two generic types of simple loop geometries (in the
circle-line approximation): a) the subcritical loop with open-
ing angle α < π/2 and b) the supercritical loop with α > π/2.
In the former case the introduction of further excess length
leads to an energy increase but in the latter case to a re-
laxation of stress: The introduction of additional length at
points XL and XR followed by a relaxation of the structure
obviously decreases the total energy.

one might argue as follows: For excess lengths shorter
than the persistence length of DNA it is increasingly dif-
ﬁcult to store additional length into the loop because
it requires increasing DNA deformation. On the other
hand, for loops longer than lP the bending energy con-
tribution becomes very small and hence one expects such
ground state loops relaxing with increasing ∆L. However
the reason for occurence of a maximum of Umin around
2 excess DNA lengths, a value which is considerably
≈
smaller than the persistence length, is not obvious. In or-
der to understand this ﬁnding one has to go beyond the
simple handwaving heuristics and needs to take a close
look at the details of the loop geometry.

To this end we introduce here a simple approximation
technique which leads to explicit expressions which can
be more easily handled than the exact yet complicated
expressions given above. We call this method the circle-
line approximation and give a detailed exposition in the
Appendix. As we will see this method is quite accurate
and at the same time very intuitive.

Looking at the geometrical shapes of the loops in Fig. 3
we notice that each of them is subdivided into several
sections of very high and very low curvature (cf. also
Eq.17). In ﬁrst approximation we replace the high cur-
vature regions by sections of circles, the low curvature
regions by straight lines (cf. Fig. 6). Furthermore, to
keep the smoothness we assume that the lines are tan-
gents to the circles. Generally in order to have reasonable
approximations of all possible loop shapes we would need
to consider compositions of several circles and lines (cf.
for instance loops 3, 6, 7). However, if the adsorption en-
ergies are not to high, i.e., if the opening angle α is ”soft
enough” and does not impose such a severe bending like
in loop 3, such multiply bent loops will not be relevant as
ground state solutions. As it turns out for our problem
we already obtain a quite good approximation by assum-
ing that the loop consists of a single circular arc and two
lines only. It is characterized by two quantities : 1) the
arc radius r and 2) the nucleosome opening angle α (cf.

imal energy curve within the circle-line approximation,

approach is also demonstrated for some other examples.

B. Crossed and Entropic Loops

A closer inspection of Fig. 4 shows that the ground
state of loops switches from simple uncrossed loops to
crossed loops when one reaches an excess length around
50 nm. However, as can be seen for the crossed structures
4, 5 and 6 in Fig. 3 these loops have a self-penetration
at the crossing point. Therefore, a planar theory is in
principle not suﬃcient to describe such structures. One
possible formal cure for this problem would be to leave
the plane and to consider the rod’s self-contacts with the
corresponding point-forces etc.
in 3D as done by Cole-
man et al.
in a general theory of rod self-contacts [27].
However such a procedure leads to a signiﬁcant loss of
transparence, not only because of the third dimension
entering the scene but also due to the necessity to sub-
divide the rod into diﬀerent regions with diﬀerent forces
acting in each of them. Instead of following Coleman at
al. [27] we decided to treat the self-interaction in a per-
turbative manner as follows. If the self-contact point is
not too close to the nucleosome the rod is not severely
deﬂected out of the plane by its self-interaction. Thus it
remains roughly planar with some out of plane bending in
Z-direction of the rod sections between the nucleosome
and the crossing point. This will cost some additional
bending energy Udef that is roughly given by (cf. Ap-
pendix)

≈

With this additional modiﬁcation of Utot we computed
numerically the minimal energy (ground state) solution
for any given excess length ∆L. The graph of the ground
state energy versus ∆L is shown if Fig. 5. We ﬁnd
that even with the inclusion of the out-of-plane deﬂec-
tion there is still a critical length ∆Lcross (here
60nm)
where the crossed loops become energetically more fa-
vorable than the simple uncrossed. This behavior that
we call the ”crossing transition” can be rationalized by
noting that for long enough loops the adsorption energy
(proportional to α) starts to dominate over the bending
energy so that loops with smaller α become increasingly
favorable. From the critical length ∆Lcross on, the gain
in adsorption energy (by diminishing α) is more than suf-
ﬁcient to outweigh the (slight) increase in bending energy
together with the additional self-interaction term, Eq. 26.
Increasing the length even further we leave the elas-
tic energy dominated regime in which the entropic ef-
fects can be neglected due to short loop length (<
persis-
∼
tence length). For larger lengths entropic eﬀects become
more and more important and we ultimatively enter the
entropic loop regime. The crossover between these two
regimes is hard to handle analytically [28]; for the case of
closed loops a perturbative description has been given in
Ref. [29]. For our purpose it is suﬃcient only to consider
the asymptotic behavior. In the large loop limit where
the loop is longer than several lP the chain looses its ”ori-
entational memory” exponentially and behaves roughly
as a random walk which starts from and returns to the
same point. The entropic cost for gluing the ends of a
random walk (long loop) together is then given by

U = 3/2kBT ln(∆L/lP ) + E0 + S0

(27)

6.5 kBT is the bending + ad-
The ﬁrst constant, E0 ≈
sorption energy contribution of the overcrossing DNA
segments leaving / entering the nucleosome which can be
determined by minimizing the crossed loop energy (cf.
Appendix Eq. 31) for ∆L

constant S0 ∼

fers in many respects from the usual diﬀusion process as
for short time intervals big jumps are still available with
signiﬁcant probability. Moreover, all moments (besides
possibly the ﬁrst few ones) diverge. For our case γ = 3/2
even the ﬁrst moment does not exist. We note that the
value 3/2 is based on the assumption of an ideal chain (no
excluded volume); in general the excluded volume leads
to self-avoiding-walk statistics with a slighly larger value
of γ around 2.2 [32] (cf. also Ref. [33]). In that case one
has a ﬁnite value of the ﬁrst moment, i.e., of the average
jump length.

IV. THE DYNAMICS OF NUCLEOSOME
REPOSITIONING

In the preceding sections we have computed the typi-
cal energies involved in the formation of arbitrary sized
loops. Assuming that a slow creation followed by a fast
termal migration of loops around the nucleosome is the
governing mechanism for nucleosome repositioning we
start now considering the repositioning dynamics. In or-
der to describe the time-dependent evolution of the nu-
cleosome position we consider its probability distribution

given by the inverse lifetime of the loop (denoted by A in
that paper). This means that typical repositioning times
range from seconds to hours.

The (formal) explicit solution of Eqs. 28, 29 together
with the previously obtained minimal energy Umin is
given by

p (t) = exp(W t)p (0)

The latter solution can now be considered for diﬀerent
cases: for short or long DNA chains and for the nucle-
osome placed in the middle or at the end of the chain.

For short DNA segments we expect a slow reposition-
ing rate due to high energies involved in small loop for-
mation. In Fig. 7 we depict the repositioning of a nu-
cleosome on a DNA piece of a length 147+90 bp. Start-
ing from an end positioned nucleosome (Fig. 7a) we ob-
serve a behavior that is completely unlike a local dif-
fusion mechanism: the jumps bigger than
3.4nm
start to dominate over the smaller local ones, which fol-
lows from the loop formation energy cf. Fig. 5. Con-
sequently, in the initial phase of repositioning (of such
an end-positioned population) the nucleosomes will pre-
dominantly jump between the two end positions. Later,
on a much larger timescale they gradually start to ex-
plore the positions towards the middle of the DNA seg-
ment. Could we extract such a behavior from an experi-
ment using gel-electrophoretic separation (as in [8], [9])?
The basis of such separations is the fact that the gel-
electrophoretic mobility of nucleosomes on DNA pieces
(longer than 147bp) increases roughly linearly with its
distance from the middle position, i.e., DNA pieces with
the nucleosome sitting close to the end run much faster in
gels than equivalent middle positioned nucleosomes do.
We can exploit this (empirical) fact to mimic the outcome
of a gel-electrophoresis experiment (cf. Figs. 8 and 10).
In Fig. 8a we depict such a simulated gel pattern for the

mechanism becomes strongly non-local which contrasts
a local diﬀusive motion as expected from cork-screwing
[6, 7, 8, 9]) or small loop reposition-
motion (cf. Refs.
ing as considered by Ref. [10]. As mentioned above, this
superdiﬀusive behavior has diverging moments which im-
plies strongly enhanced nucleosome transport along very
long DNA pieces. However such an ideal superdiﬀusion
of nucleosomes could hardly occur in vivo because free
DNA segments between subsequent nucleosomes (DNA
linkers) are never longer than
O (lP ). Furthermore
the neighboring nucleosomes might be a signiﬁcant bar-
riers (if not for loop formation then) for loop migration
around the nucleosome which is an indispensable event
for loop-mediated repositioning.

∼

V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In this study we examined a possible mechanism for the
repositioning of nucleosomes along DNA which is based
on the formation and diﬀusion of intranucleosomal loops.
The most important outcome of this study is the predic-
tion of two classes of loops that might occur: (1) small
10bp-loops and (2) large loops with a wide distribution
of stored lengths with a weak peak at roughly two times
the DNA persistence length.

The small loops were already discussed in Ref. [10] and
led to the prediction of repositioning steps of 10bps. Fur-
thermore, the repositioning time should be of the order
of an hour, a consequence of the large activation energy
required to form a loop. This might explain the strong
temperature dependence of the typical repositioning time
[8]. In fact, by lowering the temperature from 37◦ to 4◦C
no redistribution within one hour was detected in that ex-
periments. Assuming a loop formation energy of 23kBT
one ﬁnds indeed a slowing down of this process by factor
of 13.

On the other hand, the large loop repositioning consid-
ered here turns out to be energetically much more favor-
able. Loops with an extra length of 2lP have an energy
that is roughly 12-13kBT smaller than that of a 10bp-
loop. To a certain extend this is because such loops can
have a very small nucleosome opening angle by forming
crossed loops but the main contribution stems from the
signiﬁcantly decreased DNA bending energy. One there-
fore expects that repositioning via large loops should be
the dominant process on suﬃciently large DNA pieces
and that the typical times are much shorter than the one
for small loop repositioning (say, of the order of minutes).
So far, however, the experiments did not report such
events. Meerseman et al.
[8, 9], for instance, found on
short DNA pieces of 207bps length results that are con-
sistent with 10bp repositioning – as we would expect for
such short DNA fragments. However, when they redid
the experiment with a 414bp long piece, a tandem repeat
of the 207bp DNA, their analysis of the complicated band
patterns observed in 2D gel electrophoresis did not show
any indication that the nucleosome was able to move from

middle positioned nucleosome. Since symmetric species
are not distinguished by this experimental method and
are projected onto the same bands (symmetric left/right
positions lead to the same mobility), the expected nonlo-
cality of motion cannot be extracted from the structure
of the bands.

For the same short segment, but with the nucleosome
starting from the middle position (Fig. 7b) the situation
is slightly diﬀerent: the neighboring positions are pop-
ulated more homogeneously, although there is a small
3.4nm distant position
initial underpopulation of the 2
as expected from the energy maximum occurring there.
In this case, a slight initial ”population gap” can be ob-
served in gel electrophoresis (Fig. 8b) which in this case
would be suﬃcient to distinguish between a jumpy and a
diﬀusive behavior, since the latter would obviously lack
the ”population gap”.

×

In the case of longer DNA (but still not entropic seg-
ments) like the 147+300 bp segment in Figs. 9 and 10,
similar eﬀects as for the short segments are expected but
with signiﬁcantly faster relaxation times by typically 2-3
orders of magnitude as compared to the corresponding
short segment populations. The corresponding (simu-
lated) electrophoretic gels are shown in Fig. 10 where for
the centrally positioned case (Fig 10b) the ”population
gap” eﬀect is even more pronounced than in the short
segment case.

For even longer DNA segments we expect the gap eﬀect
to persist (data not shown) and the optimal jump size to
be around 2-3
lP corresponding to the free energy min-
imum in Fig. 5. For very long DNA segments, the nu-
cleosome repositioning behavior implied by the big-loop-

one half to the other.

Hence, the question arises if the repositioning observed
in these experiments was facilitated via the loop mecha-
nism or if it occurred via a diﬀerent process. An analysis
of the results is made especially diﬃcult by two com-
plications: (a) the nucleosomes seem to prefer to sit on
the ends of the DNA fragments and (b) most of the ex-
periments use strong positioning sequences (like the 5S
rDNA sequence). This means that, independent of what
the repositioning process might be, the nucleosomes have
certain preferred positions and these might obscure the
underlying repositioning process.

With regard to this fact, let us consider two other repo-
sitioning mechanisms that one could imagine. The ﬁrst
one is that the nucleosome detaches completely from the
DNA and attaches at some other position (or even a dif-
ferent DNA molecule). This process, however, seems to
be excluded by two facts (among others). First that no
repositioning from one half to the other of the 414bp
DNA or to competitor DNA fragments was observed
[8, 9]. Secondly, once completely detached from the DNA
template the histone octamer becomes unstable and dis-
integrates into a tetrameric and two dimeric subunits
which makes an eﬀective nucleosome reconstitution diﬃ-

cult.

The other mechanism could be a local screwing motion
as already suggested in Ref. [9]. This process would lead
to a repositioning with one bp per step. The preponder-
ance of 10bp steps observed for the 5S rDNA experiments
could then be explained as being due to the fact that the
positioning sequence prefers the nucleosome rotationally
positioned on one side of the DNA where it can be easily
bent around the octamer. Also 10bps (and even a few
multiples of 10bps) apart this eﬀect can still be seen and
hence the nucleosome would prefer positions multiples of
10bps apart. To our best knowledge, the experiments to
date do not allow to distinguish whether the 10bp repo-
sitioning works via small loops or via cork-screwing.

It would be therefore important to perform experi-
ments on DNA pieces that do not provide the nucleo-
some with a preferred rotational setting.
In that case
the 10bp footprint should disappear if nucleosomes repo-
sition themselves via cork-screwing. It would also be im-
portant to perform experiments with rather long DNA
fragments since we expect that large-loop repositioning
can be detected in such systems.

Finally, we note that nucleosome repositioning in vivo
is facilitated via so-called chromatin remodeling com-
plexes, huge multi-protein complexes that harness energy
by burning ATP [2, 4, 5]. There are basically two ma-
jor classes: ISWI and SWI/SNF. The ﬁrst one seems to
induce small scale repositioning which might work via
twisting DNA that leads to a corkscrew movement as
discussed above. It might, however, also be possible that
this complex induces small loops on the nucleosome as
recent experiments on nicked DNA suggest [34]. The
other class of remodeling complexes seems to induce large
loop structures as they have been observed recently via
electron spectroscopy [35]. Whatever the details of the
functions of these remodeling complexes might be, it is
tempting to speculate that they catalyze and direct pro-
cesses which might even take place when they are not
present – like small loop and large loop formation as well
as screwing. In this case the computed looping energy
(cf. Fig. 5) and repositioning rates might give a ﬁrst hint
about ATP requirements and the dynamics of enzymatic
repositioning.

Another interesting and very prominent system known
to mediate nucleosome repositioning via loop formation
is unexpectedly the ubiquitous RNA-Polymerase (RNA-
P). It is found to be able to transcribe DNA through nu-
cleosomes without disrupting their structure, yet moving
them upstream the DNA template, i.e., in the opposite
direction of transcription [36]. To rationalize this seem-
ingly paradoxical ﬁnding Felsenfeld et al.
introduced a
DNA looping model [36] which assumes that the RNA-P
crosses the nucleosome in a loop. This would indeed ex-
plain the backwards directionality of repositioning. An
interesting question in this context is how our intranucle-
osomal loops considered above relate to those formed by
the RNA-P. Can we say something about the reposition-
ing distance distribution, does the looping energy (Fig. 5)

11

≈

apply here? The geometry of RNA-P - DNA complex on
a nucleosome is certainly diﬀerent from the simple loop
case, as ingoing and outgoing DNA from RNA-P enclose
100◦ (depen-
a (rather soft yet) preferential angle of
dent on RNA-P type, cf. Refs. [37, 38, 39]). The latter
facilitates the loop formation as the free DNA has to
bend less to fold back onto the octamer surface. Besides
the apparent diﬀerences from the ”naked” intranucleoso-
mal loops problem, a slight generalization of our present
model which incorporates the preferential RNA-P ”open-
ing” angle can be performed within the same mathemat-
ical framework developed here. It would be interesting
to compute the resulting nucleosome transfer distance
on short and long DNA templates in an analogous man-
ner as performed above. An outcome of such a study
could be, for instance, an answer to questions like: what
is the highest linear nucleosomal density in polynucle-
osomal arrays, up to which nucleosomes are not to be
removed from the DNA template (due to loop formation
and nucleosome transfer prohibited by the neighboring
nucleosome) during transcription.

Such fundamental biological questions make a further
elaboration of intra-nucleosomal loop theory, its gener-
alization to diﬀerent loop geometries, and ﬁnally its ap-
plication to diﬀerent loop creating proteins (SWI/SNF,
RNA-P) an intriguing task for future work.

VI. APPENDIX: THE CIRCLE-LINE
APPROXIMATION

Although the Kirchhoﬀ’s analogy provides us with es-
sentially analytic solutions for the rod deformed in plane,
the occurrence of boundary conditions (like Eqs. 5 and
6) prevents us in most cases from obtaining analytical
expressions of all the parameters characterizing the solu-
tion (like σ and m above). To overcome this problem, we
suggest here a simple geometric approximation scheme
which will prove to be useful in obtaining analytic re-
sults for loops within a reasonable accuracy (usually with
a deviation of 5-15% from the exact numeric results).

The main idea is the following. The curvature and
the energy (Eqs. 17 and 18) of the loop contains the
cn(σ
m) function which for 0 < m < 1 has the typi-
|
cal oscillatory behavior depicted in Fig. 11 (left). This
suggests to approximate the curvature function simply
by a step function consisting of an alternating sequence
of negative, zero and positive piecewise constant curva-
tures. Consequently the corresponding rod shape (Fig. 11
right) is approximated by a sequence of circles (positive /
negative constant curvature) and lines (zero curvature).
An analogous approximation procedure can also be per-
formed in the case m > 1 where the cn function has a
natural analytical continuation into a dn function with a
modiﬁed second argument (cf. Ref. [26]).

Using this approximation ansatz several problems con-
cerning planar rods reduce to elementary geometry as
seen from the following simple but illustrative examples.

12

1) The Yamakawa-Stockmayer angle [29]: Two points
on the rod are glued together without restricting the ori-
entation of the tangents, e.g., a protein connects two dis-
tant points on DNA (cf. Fig. 12a). What is the pre-
ferred angle χ between the tangents in the ground state
of the rod? By imposing a ﬁxed total rod length L we
r from
have the simple constraint L =
which we can eliminate r and write the elastic energy of
the conﬁguration as U bend
.
Its minimization leads to the transcendent condition
(cid:1)
χmin + π = tan χmin with the only relevant solution
77.5◦. The latter angle diﬀers by 5% from the
χmin ≈
81.6◦ (by Yamakawa and Stockmayer
exact result χmin ≈
in [29]) which is satisfactory regarding the simplicity of
the computation.

gency constraint is trivially fulﬁlled by the ansatz) and

for crossed loops where A, R and εads deﬁned as above
and Udef being the excluded volume interaction at the
crossing point, which is considered below (and applied
in the main text as Eq. 26). We remark that the above
expressions for Usimp and Ucross are valid within certain
α intervals which are given by the restriction 0 < α < π
and by the condition that the ﬁrst terms in the brackets
of Eqs. 30 and 31 are positive (these are the necessarily
positive bending energy contributions in the two cases.)
These fairly simple expressions can now be used in the
two cases to obtain explicitly the ground state energies
by minimizing Eq. 30 and Eq. 31 with respect to α. For
instance, setting U ′
simp (α) = 0 we obtain a transcenden-
tal equation for α. We can now use the fact that this
condition is algebraic in ∆L so that we can solve it for
∆L = ∆L (α). Thus instead of ﬁnding α = α(L) (which
cannot be given in an explicit form) we obtain explicitely
its inverse:

FIG. 11: The circle-line approximation for planar rods.
The curvature of an equilibrium rod shape (cn-function, cf.
Eq. 17) is approximated by a periodic sequence of step-
functions. The latter corresponds to an approximation of the
rod shape by a sequence of straight lines (κ = 0) and circles
(κ =const.) glued together in a smooth manner (continuous
tangents).

FIG. 12: Three applications of the circle-line approxima-
tion: Problems with complex constraints reduce to simple ge-
ometries leading to good approximations: a) the Yamakawa-
Stockmayer angle b) simple loops and c) crossed loops (see
the Appendix text for details).

range of adsorption energies with deviations becoming
larger for adsorption energies above εads = 2.0 kBT /nm
(data not shown).

3) The overcrossing potential for crossed loops (Fig.
14): The outgoing DNA path is perturbed out of the
plane due to the interaction with the ingoing DNA (and
vice versa in a symmetrical manner). Because of that our
simple planar and phantom model (no self interaction)
needs modiﬁcations.
Instead of solving this (nonpla-
nar) problem within the general theory of self-interacting
deformed rods as in Ref. [27] (which is a feasible but
rather technical numerical task) we can treat the out-of-
plane deformation perturbationally. The ﬁrst assump-
tion we make here is that the overall shape of the crossed
loop does not deviate much from a planar conﬁguration
though the orientation of its (eﬀective) plane might be
slightly deﬂected from the nucleosomal plane. Conse-
quently the small perturbation out of the plane and the
deformation in plane essentially decuple into a sum of
two energy contributions as in Eq.31. Again by simple
geometry (cf. Fig 13), the second (out of the plane) term
in 31 can in ﬁrst approximation be written as

We ﬁnally note that besides the above given examples
it is possible to apply the circle-line approximation to
several other standard problems of rod theory like the
ﬁrst and especially the higher order Euler buckling in-
stabilities to obtain qualitatively the known results from
buckling theory with very little eﬀort. Thus the circle-
line approximation when applied appropriately turns out
to be very useful and generally allows computationally
inexpensive qualitative and quantitative insights into the
behavior of (planary) deformed rods.

From Eq. 32 together with Eq. 30 we obtain an ex-
plicit parametric representation of the minimal energy
curve for simple loops. A comparison of the approximate
minimal energies (Eq. 32 and Eq. 30) with the exact min-
imal energy (cf. also Fig.5 for ∆L <
60nm) is shown in
∼
Fig. 13. We ﬁnd that the quantitative agreement is quite
satisfactory taking the simplicity of our ansatz into ac-
count. We note here that analogous computations as we
have shown for simple loops can be performed for crossed
loops as well.
For ∆L

0 we ﬁnd after an appropriate expan-
sion of Usimp around α = 0 that the ground state en-
(∆L/R)1/3 in agreement with
ergy scales as Usimp ∼
Ref. [10]. Further we obtain the excess length at which
the loop ground state energy is maximal by setting
|α=π/2 = 0. From this follows the critical
∂Usimp (α) /∂α
length ∆Lcrit as discussed in the main text (cf. Eq. 24).
This simple approximate expression for ∆Lcrit agrees

→

9 The latter means that for π/2 ≤ α ≤ αmax there are two diﬀerent
excess loop lengths leading to the same (equilibrium) angle α
,i.e., with increasing ∆L the nucleosome angle α opens but after

passing some critical point on the ∆L axis, it starts closing again.

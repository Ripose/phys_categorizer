We present a stochastic model for the size of a taxon in paleobiology, in which we allow for the
evolution of new taxon members, and both individual and catastrophic extinction events. The model
uses ideas from the theory of birth and death processes. Some general properties of the model are
developed, and a fuller discussion is given for speciﬁc distributions of the time between catastrophic
extinction events. Long tails in the taxon size distribution arise naturally from the model.

PACS numbers: 87.23

Random processes leading to probability distributions
with slowly-decaying algebraic tails have been of consid-
erable recent interest in physics, although they have been
sporadically studied in other areas for many years. As
probability laws with Pr{X > x} ∝ x−α as x → ∞
are naturally associated with scaling properties, self-
similarity and fractals, it is tempting to propose fractal
underlying mechanisms to explain the occurrence of these
laws in particular contexts in nature.

We address a problem of interest in paleobiology, where
long-tailed distributions arise, and propose a model that
requires no explicitly fractal underlying mechanism to ex-
plain these distributions. The model predicts the distri-
bution of the number of elements in a taxon, for example
the number of species in a genus, and our analysis cov-
ers both the distribution of species currently in existence,
and the distribution of all species in the genus that have
ever existed, some of which may now be extinct.

Several other problems in taxonomy and genetics in-
volve similar mathematical analysis, and the authors
have brieﬂy addressed elsewhere [1, 2] the ﬁtting of mod-
els of this type to real biological data. More generally, the
basic modelling approach in this paper involves killing
at an exponentially distributed time a stochastic process
for which the mean grows exponentially in time. The ap-
pearance of power-law distributions in such contexts has
been discussed in general by the authors elsewhere [3],
and has applications in social phenomena [4] and other
contexts not covered in the present paper.

Modelling of taxon size has been of sporadic interest in
the literature for some time [5, 6, 7], and there has been a
steady accumulation of relevant data on both extinct and
surviving taxonomic groups [8, 9]. We shall not address
mechanisms for species interaction in an ecosystem that
may drive extinction or species proliferation, nor shall we
address the shape of evolutionary trees (cladograms).

In our model, a taxon comes into existence with a sin-
gle representative species, genus or family at time t = 0.
The number of members of the taxon grows with time as
species mutate. Some species produce many new species,
but any species may also become extinct, and a natural
model for the proliferation and extinction of taxon mem-

bers is the linear birth–death process (see, for example,
[10], pp. 165–167 and pp. 265–266). A taxon member
(referred to hereafter as a species) has in the time inter-
val (t, t + h) a probability λh + o(h) of ‘giving birth’ to a
new species, and a probability µh + o(h) of ‘dying’. As-
suming independence of speciation and extinction events,
if there are n species present at time t, the probability
of one speciation occurring in (t, t + h) is λnh + o(h),
and the probability of one extinction is µnh + o(h). Let
Mt denote the number of species that have ever existed
(whether currently alive or not) at time t and Nt the
number of species currently alive at time t, and write
pm,n(t) = Pr{Mt = m, Nt = n}. Then for h > 0,

pm,n(t + h) = [1 − n(λ + µ)h + o(h)]pm,n(t)

+[λh + o(h)](n − 1)pm−1,n−1(t)
+[µh + o(h)](n + 1)pm,n+1(t) + o(h).

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side corresponds to no
change in Mt or Nt in the time interval (t, t + h), the
second to one birth, and the third to one death. All
other events have probability o(h). Subtracting pm,n(t)
from both sides, dividing by h and letting h → 0, we
deduce the diﬀerential-diﬀerence equation

d
dt

pm,n(t) = −(λ + µ)npm,n(t) + λ(n − 1)pm−1,n−1(t)

+µ(n + 1)pm,n+1(t).

This equation is valid for all integer m and n provided
that we adopt the convention that pm,n(t) = 0 if m ≤ 0
or n < 0. We measure time from the appearance of
the ﬁrst individual, so that pm,n(0) = 1 if m = n = 1;
pm,n(0) = 0 otherwise. Introducing the generating func-
tion P (ξ, ζ, t) = E{ξMt ζNt} (where E denotes expecta-
tion) one may readily derive [11] the partial diﬀerential
Pζ with initial con-
equation Pt =
dition P (ξ, ζ, 0) = ξζ. Using the method of characteris-
tics one ﬁnds [11] that

ξζ2λ − (λ + µ)ζ + µ

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

P (ξ, ζ, t) = ξ

z2(ζ − z1)eλξz1t + z1(z2 − ζ)eλξz2t
(ζ − z1)eλξz1t + (z2 − ζ)eλξz2t

,

(1)

where z1 and z2 denote the roots of the quadratic equa-
tion ξλz2 − (λ + µ)z + µ = 0. Since the probability that
Mt species have ever existed up to time t is given by
∞
n=1 pmn, setting ζ = 1 in Eq. (1) we
Pr{Mt = m} =
recover the generating function for the probability that
Mt species have ever existed up to time t:

P

E{ξMt } =

x2(λξ − x1)ex1t + x1(x2 − λξ)ex2t
λ[(λξ − x1)ex1t + (x2 − λξ)ex2t]

.

For brevity we have let xi = λξzi, so that x1 and x2 are
the roots of x2 − (λ + µ)x + λµξ = 0. These roots are
distinct for all µ and λ when ξ < 1. The roots become λ
and µ when ξ = 1, so that the case λ = µ is degenerate
for ξ = 1, but this presents no diﬃculties in the subse-
quent analysis. Using the results that x1 + x2 = λ + µ
and x1x2 = λµξ, establishes the form of the generating
function needed below:

E{ξMt } = ξ +

λξ(ξ − 1)[e(x2t − ex1t]
(x2 − λξ)ex2t − (x1 − λξ)ex1t .

(2)

To make contact with better known results on the num-
ber of species currently alive, we note that setting ξ = 1
gives z1 = 1 and z2 = µ/λ and Eq. (1) becomes [12]

µ(1 − ζ) − (µ − λζ)e−t(λ−µ)
λ(1 − ζ) − (µ − λζ)e−t(λ−µ)

if λ 6= µ,

1 − (1 − ζ)/[1 + λt(1 − ζ)]−1 if λ = µ.

That hNti = e(λ−µ)t follows by diﬀerentiation, while ex-
pansion of the generating function gives ([10], p. 166)
Pr{Nt = 0} = (µ−µe−t(λ−µ))/(λ−µe−t(λ−µ)); for n ≥ 1,

Pr{Nt = n} =

(λ − µ)2e−t(λ−µ)

.

In the limiting case λ = µ, Pr{Nt = 0} = λt/(1 + λt)
and Pr{Nt = n} = (λt)n−1/(1 + λt)n+1 for n ≥ 1. When
µ = 0 (that is, there is a pure birth process) the solution
reduces to that found by Yule [5] in his model of species
evolution under a speciation rate λ.

There is considerable evidence for major catastrophic
extinctions occurring within a relatively short period,
these extinctions having been attributed to various
causes, including major meteorite impacts [13] and a hy-
pothesised purely biotic mechanism called coevolution-
ary avalanches [14]. To include catastrophic extinctions
in our model, we require the probability density function
f (t) for the time T between the start of a taxon and
the next catastrophe. In the analysis below we carry a
general f (t) as far as possible. The three speciﬁc models
discussed here are proposed with some diﬃdence, though
each has a certain natural appeal, and each may apply
to appropriate subsets of paleological data. The common
thread to all three models is that as t → ∞,

2

with 1/θ the mean time between catastrophic extinction
events and either q = 0 or q = −1. The small-t behavior
is diﬀerent in the three models, but this diﬀerence does
not aﬀect the dominant asymptotic behavior of the taxon
size distribution. Using Eq. (3) with some ﬂexibility as
to the value of q seems a reasonable approach.

(a) The pure exponential model. As a ﬁrst model one
may assume that f (t) = θe−θt for t > 0. This asserts
that the waiting time for the next catastrophe is expo-
nentially distributed, but eﬀectively considers only one
taxon: no account is taken of the fact that in a long time
interval, many taxons should be initiated, while in a short
time interval, it is likely that no taxons will be initiated.
Subtle conditional probability eﬀects are ignored.

For models (b) and (c) below, we assume that catas-
trophic extinction events occur in a Poisson process at
rate θ, while taxon initiations occur in a Poisson process
at rate ρ. Thus the probability density function for the
waiting time between extinctions is ψ(t) = θe−θt, t > 0,
while the waiting-time density for the start of the next
taxon is χ(t) = ρe−ρt, t > 0.

(b) The ﬁrst new taxon model. Consider the time to
the next catastrope for the ﬁrst taxon initiated after the
previous catastrophe. If we condition on the time T be-
tween catastrophes, the conditional waiting-time density
for appearance of a taxon is ρe−ρt/(1 − e−ρT ), 0 < t < T .
The time between the appearance of the taxon and the
next catastrophe therefore has the probability density
function η(t | T ) = ρeρ(t−T )/(1 − e−ρT ), 0 < t < T . We
now average over T to deduce for the time from taxon
commencement to the next catastrophe the density

It can be shown that f (t) ∼ θ ln[1/(ρt)] as t → 0, while
f (t) ∼ [ρθ/(ρ + θ)] e−θt as t → ∞.

(c) Uniform taxon nucleation between catastrophes.
The probability that there is at least one taxon initiated
in the time interval of duration τ between two succes-
sive catastrophes is 1 − e−ρτ . It is known [15] that for a
Poisson process with rate ρ, conditional on there being n
occurrences in a time interval of length τ , the occurrence
times have the same distribution as the order statistics of
a set of n independent times, each uniformly distributed
on the interval of length τ . This suggests as a model for
the probability density function for the time to the next
catastrophe

The size of a surviving taxon. We address brieﬂy the
distribution of the number N of species in a taxon that

(3)

are living just before a catastrophic extinction event oc-
curs; equivalently this is asking for the distribution of
taxon size today, the detail residing in the probability
density function f (t) for the time since the taxon began.
The case λ < µ, in which a taxon is driven rapidly to
extinction, is not considered. We shall consider only the
case f (t) = θe−θt, t ≥ 0. Since relatively simple expres-
sions for Pr{Nt = n} are available, the direct calculation
of the distribution of

Pr{N = n} =

Pr{Nt = n}f (t)dt

becomes possible; the details are equivalent to those in a
model of live taxa where both species and genera prolif-
erate [1] and will not be given here.

In the case λ = µ, the distribution of N is reasonably

rapidly decaying, though its dominant form is subtle:

Pr{N = n} ∼ π1/2(θ/λ)5/4n

.

The stretched exponential behavior is typical of the
crossover behavior in problems of stochastic processes or
statistical physics when exponential decay degenerates to
algebraic decay as a parameter (here µ) passes through
a critical value (here λ).

If λ > µ, we ﬁnd Pr{N = n} ∼ constant×n−1−θ/(λ−µ),
so that Pr{N ≥ n} ∼ constant × n−θ/(λ−µ) as n → ∞.
The mean taxon size is inﬁnite if λ ≥ µ + θ. Applications
of these formulae to real data are given elsewhere [17].

Proliferation between catastrophes. The problem of
greater palaeobiological interest concerns the number of
species that ever belong to a taxon. As before, let f (t) be
the waiting-time density for the time T after the emer-
gence of a taxon to the next global extinction. The case
f (t) = θe−θt is of most interest, but we carry generality
when we may. Let the random variable M be the num-
ber of species in a taxon that exists only between two
successive catastrophes. With Mt the number of species
that have ever existed up to time t, we have

3

Var{M } = 2χ ′(1) + χ(1) − χ(1)2. The function χ(ξ)
is symmetric under interchange of x1 and x2. We shall
identify x2 with the root that approaches λ as ξ → 1, and
x1 with the root that approaches µ as ξ → 1. Solving the
quadratic equation for x1 and x2 exactly and expanding
the solutions for 1 − ξ → 0, we record for later use that
x1 = µ − λµ(1 − ξ)/(λ − µ) + O([1 − ξ]2),
x2 = λ + λµ(1 − ξ)/(λ − µ) + O([1 − ξ]2).

Provided that the integral in Eq. (5) converges for ξ = 1,
we ﬁnd that the expected value of M is

hM i = 1 +

λ[e(λ−µ)t − 1]f (t)dt

.

Z

(6)

For λ < µ, the mean is ﬁnite for every density f (t). The
degenerate case λ = µ can be analysed separately, or by
taking the limit λ → µ from below inside the integral in
Eq. (6), giving hM i = 1 + λhT i, so hM i diverges in the
degenerate case λ = µ if the mean waiting time hT i for
catastrophic extinctions is inﬁnite.

For λ > µ, the integral in Eq. (6) establishes that
unless f (t) has at least exponential decay, the mean is
necessarily divergent. If f (t) ∼ constant × tr exp(−θt)
as t → ∞, then the mean taxon size if ﬁnite so long as
λ < µ + θ. Whether it is also ﬁnite in the critical case
λ = µ+θ depends on the value of r. In particular, for the
exponential density f (t) = θe−θt we ﬁnd that hM i = ∞
if λ ≥ µ + θ, while hM i = 1 + λ/(θ + µ − λ) if λ < µ + θ.
To analyse the case λ > µ, we shall rewrite the integral

for χ(ξ) in the equivalent form

χ(ξ) =

∞

λ{1 − e−(x2−x1)t}f (t)dt
(x2 − λξ) − (x1 − λξ)e−(x2−x1)t .

The exponentials are decaying functions of time, since
x2 − x1 = λ − µ + 2λµ(1 − ξ)/(λ − µ) + O([1 − ξ]2) as
1 − ξ → 0. Hence to leading order,

[16] or [18], Ap-
Mellin transform methods (see, e.g.
pendix 2) can be used to extract the asymptotic behavior
of this integral and so determine the expansion for φ(ξ)
near ξ = 1. We ﬁnd that for λ > θ + µ,
πλ[κ(1 − ξ)]θ/(λ−µ)

φ(ξ) = 1 −

while φ(ξ) = 1 − (λ/θ)(1 − ξ) ln[κ−1(1 − ξ)−1] + · · · for
λ = θ + µ. This asymptotic behavior of φ(ξ) suggests the
following behavior of pm as m → ∞:

pm ∼

(cid:26)

constant × m−1−θ/(λ−µ), λ > θ + µ,
constant × m−2 ln m
λ = θ + µ.

To derive this rigorously would require either a careful
argument based around Darboux’s Theorem [18], or the
methods of Flajolet and Odlyzko [19], or Tauberian The-
orems supplemented by information about the ultimate
monotonic decay of pm [18, 20]. We obtain the same
asymptotic behavior for the total number of species that
ever existed as that found for currently living species:

Pr{M ≥ m} ∼

constant × m−θ/(λ−µ), λ > θ + µ
constant × m−1 ln m,
λ = θ + µ.

More generally, note that as ξ → 1,

It can be shown that if f (t) ∼ Θtre−θt (r > −1) then

There has been a signiﬁcant prior work on the mod-
elling of populations subject to disasters in other con-
texts, with particular emphasis on the time to extinc-
tion in the process [21]. However, the principal conclu-
sions of the present paper, especially those drawn for
the properties of extinct taxa, appear to be new. We
have shown that the competition between characteris-
tic rates of species proliferation, individual species ex-
tinction, and large-scale catastrophic extinction is able
to generate long-tailed distributions of taxon size and
consequent scaling properties and fractal interpretations
without the need to assume an underlying fractal model.
The formalism covers both currently live taxa, and taxa
destroyed out by previous global catastrophic extinction
events. Our results are based on a null model for prolifer-
ations and extinctions. The validity of the model can be
assessed by comparing the results established with em-
pirical size distributions for living and fossil taxa (as in
[1]). Models for evolution with an underlying dynam-
ics have been proposed [22]. The null model provides a
useful benchmark against which the predictions of more
detailed models may be assessed and its concepts and
analytical methods may have applications in other areas.

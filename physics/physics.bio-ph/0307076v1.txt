Abstract

Simple hidden Markov models are proposed for predicting secondary structure of a protein from its
amino acid sequence. Since the length of protein conformation segments varies in a narrow range, we
ignore the duration eﬀect of length distribution, and focus on inclusion of short range correlations of
residues and of conformation states in the models. Conformation-independent and -dependent amino
acid coarse-graining schemes are designed for the models by means of proper mutual information. We
compare models of diﬀerent level of complexity, and establish a practical model with a high prediction
accuracy.

1 Introduction

Methods for predicting the secondary structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence have been devel-
oped for 3 decades. Besides neural network models and nearest-neighbor methods, the Chou-Fasman/GOR
statistical method is well-established and commonly used. In 1974, assuming an oversimpliﬁed independency
to cope with the large size 20 of the amino acid alphabets at a small size of database, Chou and Fasman
(1974) derived a table of propensity for a particular residue to be in a given secondary structure state. By
combining with a set of rules, the protein secondary structure was predicted using this propensity. Later, in
the ﬁrst version of the GOR program (Garnier, Osguthorpe, and Robson, 1978), the state of a single residue
ai was predicted according to a window from i − 8 to i + 8 surrounding the residue. Unlike Chou-Fasman
which assumes that each amino acid individually inﬂuences its own secondary structure state, GOR takes
into account the inﬂuence of the amino acids ﬂanking the central residue on the central residue state by
deriving an information score from the weight matrix describing 17 individual amino acid frequencies at
sites i + k with −8 ≤ k ≤ +8. By using a single weight matrix, the correlation among amino acids within
the window was still ignored. In the later version GOR III (Gibrat, Garnier, and Robson, 1987), instead of
single weight matrix for every structure state, 20 weight matrices, each of which corresponds to a speciﬁc
type of the central residue, were used. These conditional weight matrices take the pair correlation between
the central residue and a ﬂanking one into account. In the most recent version of GOR (GOR IV, Garnier,
Gibrat, and Robson, 1996), all pairwise combinations of amino acids in the ﬂanking region were included.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989) have been applied to molecular biology, in particular
in gene-ﬁnding. There is a constant tendency in developing HMMs for protein structure prediction (Asai et

1

al.,1993; Stultz et al., 1993; Karplus et al., 1997; Camproux et al. 1999). A probabilistic approach similar to
the gene ﬁnder Genscan has been developped for protein secondary structure prediction without using sliding
windows (Schmidler, Liu and Brutlag, 2000). In terms of Bayesian segmentation, the mothod integrated
explicit models for secondary structure classes helices, sheets and loops with other observed structure aspects
such as segment capping signals and length distributions, and reached an accuracy comparable to GOR.

Compared with DNA sequences, protein sequences are generally short, and their amino acid alphabet
is of a large size 20. The range of lengths of secondary structure segments is rather small. The eﬀect of
duration might play a less important role. Here we develop a simple hidden Markov model with higher order
correlations included for the secondary structure prediction. We propose several schemes for the amino acid
alphabet reduction in order to incorporate residue correlation in the model. While the model is much simpler
than the Bayesian segmentation model, its performance is still competitive.

2 Methods

A simpliﬁed version of the model can be constructed in the frame of the Chou-Fasman propensity scheme.
We shall start with this model to explain several key points, and then discuss more realistic models.

In the Chou-Fasman approach, discriminant thresholds and post-prediction ﬁltering rules are required.

They can be avoided in a full probabilistic model.

As in the most methods, we consider 3 states {h, e, c} generated from the 8 states of Kabsch and Sander
(1983) by the coarse-graining H, G, I → h, E → e and X, T, S, B → c. Let R ≡ R1:n = R1R2 . . . Rn be a
sequence of n amino acid residues, and its corresponding secondary structure sequence be S = S1S2 . . . Sn.
The structure prediction is the mapping from R to S. The main restriction to a structure sequence is that
the shortest length of the consecutive state h must be 3, and that of e be 2. To cope with this restriction,
we use triplet states instead of the 3 single states c, e and h. In the total 27 triplets, only 19 are legitimate.
The forbidden 8 are of the type ¯ee¯e or ¯hh¯h, where ¯e indicates a non-e, i.e. either c or h, and the meaning
of ¯h is analogous. The ﬁrst order Markov model for the triplets is the third order Markov model for the
original mono-states. Any of the 19 triplets can only transit either to 3 or to 1 state. That is, the transition
matrix is rather sparse. The 19 triplets and their transited states are listed in Table 1.

Denoting by σi the triplet states, we may translate S1:n to Σ2:n−1 = σ2σ3 . . . σn−1 of length n − 2. (Note
that the subscripts i for σi are from 2 to n − 1 for convenience.) The Markov process for σ is characterized
by the set of probabilities for initial states

π(l) = Prob(σ2 = l),

and the transition rates

Sequence R is then related to Σ or S by the emission probabilities

Tkl = Prob(σi = l|σi−1 = k) = T (σi−1, σi).

P (x|δ) = Prob(Ri = x|σi = δ),

which generate S2:n−1. Extra probabilities

Q(x|δ) = Prob(Rj = x|σj±1 = δ), j ∈ {1, n}

are needed for generating R1 and Rn.

The joint probability is then

The predicted structure is infered as

By means of the recursion relation

Γ2(σ) = Q(S1|σ)π(σ)P (R2|σ),

Γi(σ) = maxδΓi−1(δ)T (δ, σ)P (Ri|σ),

2 < i < n,

Γ ≡ Γn = maxδΓn−1(δ)Q(Sn|δ),

and by recording the pre-state leading to the maximal Γi(σ), the ‘best’ path Σ∗ can be traced back from the
last σ∗

n−1. This is the so-called Viterbi algorithm for dynamic programming.

According to the standard forward-backward algorithm for HMMs, the forward and backward variables

Ai and Bi may be deﬁned as follows.

A2(σ) = Q(S1|σ)π(σ)P (R2|σ),

Ai(σ) =

Ai−1(δ)T (δ, σ)P (Ri|σ),

So far, only the correlation of conformation states has been considered. Residue triple will involve
203 = 8000 parameters for each state σ. To avoid large training sets and model overﬁtting, a reduced
amino acid alphabet is desired. For example, the reduction of 20 amino acids to 3 classes leads to only 27
combinations. However, there are as many as

ways of clustering 20 amino acids into 3 classes (Duran and Odell, 1974). For a given clustering {ai}19
i=0 →
{bj}, bj ∈ {0, 1, 2}, denoting by ρi = ri−1riri+1 the reduced residue triple corresponding to state σi, we may
calculate the mutual information between the reduced residue triple ρ and the triple state σ:

I(ρ, σ) = H[ρ] + H[σ] − H[ρ, σ],

(21)

where H[x] is the Shannon entropy of x. (If the clustering independent H[σ] is ignored, I would become the
conditional entropy H[σ|ρ].) The best clustering may be determined by maximizing the objective function
I(ρ, σ). The replacement of the above P (Ri|σi) with P (ρi|σi) leads to a version which takes some residue
correlation into account.

A more realistic model uses quintuplets. Among the total 35 = 243 quintuplets of the conformation
states, only 75 are legitimate. Exclusion of 7 rare ones (eceeh, hceeh, heece, heech, heeeh, heehh, and
hheeh) further reduces the total number of states into 68, which are listed in Table 2. We shall still use the
same notation σi for these 68 conformation states. To take residue quintuplet correlation into account, we
substitute the central residue score P (Ri|σi) with P (Ri|σi, ri−2ri−1ri+1ri+2), where ri stands for reduced
residue classes. More words need to be said about the amino acid clustering. We have observed the fact
that counts of ccccc, eeeee and hhhhh in databases are dominant over those of remaining 65. The various
propensities of amino acid residues to diﬀerent conformations imply that amino acid clustering should depend
on conformations. We want to cluster amino acids separately for each conformation. For this purpose, for
example, to ﬁnd the best clustering at conformation c, we collect a subset of residue quintuplets whose
conformation is ccccc. Denote by R0 the central residue of a residue quintuplet, and by r−2r−1r1r2 the
reduced classes of the other 4 residues. Taking the mutual information I(R0, r−2r−1r1r2) as the objective
function, we determine the best clustering at c. To ﬁnd at which position the residue depends most strongly
on others, we calculate mutual information for nonreduced residue placed at diﬀerent positions of a residue
quintuplet. While the largest I is found when the nonreduced residue is at the center for conformation e,
the position of the nonreduced residue which gives the largest I is the second position for conformation c,
and is the ﬁfth for h. However, for either c or h, the largest I is still very close to I(R0, r−2r−1r1r2). The
mutual information excesses with respect to I(R0, r−2r−1r1r2) for diﬀerent positions at conformations c, e
and h are listed in Table 3. Thus, for simplicity, we always place the nonreduced residue at the center for
all conformations. We then calculate reﬁned residue scores from the conformation-dependent clustering. For
example,

P (Ri|σi = ccchh, ri−2ri−1ri+1ri+2) → P (Ri|σi, rc

i−2rc

i−1rh

i+1rh

i+2),

(22)

where the superscript of ri indicates its conformation. The whole procedure for the dynamic programming
remains almost the same, except for some care when dealing with two more end sites.

3 Result

We create a nonredundant set of 1612 non-membrane proteins for training parameters from PDB SELECT
(Hobohm and Sander, 1994) with amino acid identity less than 25% issued on 25 September of 2001. The
secondary structure for these sequences are taken from DSSP database (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). As
mentioned above, the eight states of DSSP are coarse-grained into 3 states: h, e and c. This learning set
contains 268031 residues with known conformations, among which 94415 are h, 56510 are e, and 117106 are
c. The size of the learning set is reasonable for training our parameters. There are 296 unknown residues.
We add an extra ‘unknown’ amino acid category called X to the 20 known ones.

In order to assess the accuracy of our approach, we use the following 2 test sets: Sets 1 and 2. A set of 124
nonhomologous proteins is created from the representative database of Rost and Sander (1993) by removing
subunits A and B of hemagglutinin 3hmg, which are designated as membrane protein by SCOP (Murzin
et al, 1995). The 124 sequences and the learning set are not independent of each other according to HSSP
database (Dodge, Schneider and Sander, 1998). That is, some proteins of the 124 sequences are homologous
with certain proteins in the learning set. Removing the homologous proteins from the 124 sequences and 5
seuqences with unknown amino acid segments longer than 6, we construct Set 1 of 76 proteins. Nonredundant
34 proteins with known structures of the CASP4 database issued in December of 2000 are taken as Set 2
(CASP4, 2000).

3.1 Amino acid clustering

The ﬁrst method for clustering uses the mutual information I(ρ, σ) between the reduced oligo-peptide ρ
and its corresponding conformation σ. Setting the number of reduced classes at 3, 4 and 5, and ﬁxing σ to
be triplets, we ﬁnd the conformation-independent clustering of amino acids as shown in Table 4. Roughly
speaking, class 0 is the hydrophobic, and is the same for the all 3 clusterings (except for the ‘unknown’ X in
the clustering into 5). Increasing the number of classes from 3 to 4, 5 results in new classes forming by single
special amino acids P(Pro) and G(Gly). The similar clustering may be conducted in terms of quintuplets,
but the results do not coincide with those from triplets.

The second method for clustering is conformation-dependent. We collect residue quintuplets of conforma-
tions ccccc, eeeee and hhhhh separately. The objective function for clustering now is the mutual information
I(R0, r−2r−1r1r2|σ) with conformation σ ﬁxed. The results of clustering into 3 and 4 classes are listed in
Table 5. Indeed, the cluster patterns for diﬀerent conformations are quite dissimilar.

3.2 Secondary structure prediction

We shall index diﬀerent models by Ns-Na, where Ns and Na are the numbers of conformation states and
residue combinations, respectively. For example, the simplest model is model 19-21, which uses P (Ri|Si−1SiSi+1)
to score residues. We may also use the propensity scores P (Ri|Si−1SiSi+1)/P (Ri), which result in an extra
n
factor
i=0 P (Ri). Since the factor is independent of conformation sequences, it brings no new eﬀect. When
the scores are replaced by P (ri−1riri+1|Si−1SiSi+1) with ri being the reduced 3-class residues, we have
model 19-3 × 3 × 3. The ﬁrst and last sites of the predicted conformation of any sequences are always set at

Q

5

conformation c. For model 19-21 we determine the best conformation sequence as whole by the Viterbi algo-
rithm and single residue conformation states by the Baum-Welch algorithm. To assess prediction methods,
we calculate for each conformation the sensitivity sn and speciﬁcity sp

sn =

T P
T P + F N

,

sp =

T P
T P + F P

,

(23)

where T P , F P and F N are site counts of the ‘true positive’, ‘false positive’ and ‘true negative’ with respect
to the observed real conformation. The results of model 19-21 are listed in Table 6, where the total sensitivity
Q3 for all conformations is also given. It is clearly seen that the inference from the Baum-Welch marginal
posterior is signiﬁcantly superior to that from the Viterbi algorithm in Q3 value.

The next examined model uses reduced residue triplets. Reducing amino acids into 3 and 4 classes, we
have models 19-27 and 19-64, respectively. The prediction accuracies of these two models are also listed in
Tabel 6. We see that the inclusion of residue correlation dramatically improves the prediction accuracy.

The remaining part of Table 6 shows the prediction accuracies of quintuplet models. We examine the
models on both test Sets 1 and 2. For all the models we take P (Ri|ri−2ri−1ri+1ri+2, σi) as the residue
scores. We ﬁrst compare conformation-independent with conformation-dependent clustering of amino acids.
We ﬁnd that the conformation-dependent clustering gains about 1 percent in the prediction accuracy for
model 68-81×21. The conformation-independent clustering is then not considered later on. Model 68-256×21
contains more information about correlated residues, and has a better performance. The accuracies obtained
on Set 1 are generally higher than those on Set 2. Besides the popular predictor GOR IV, there is another
secondary structure predictor SSP (Solovyev and Salamov, 1991, 1994) based on discriminant analysis using
single sequence. To compare with them, their accuracies on the same test sets are also listed in the table.

4 Discussions

We have presented simple hidden Markov models to predict secondary structure using single protein sequence.
The hidden sequence is generated by a Markov process of multi-site conformation states. Considering
that structure segments of proteins are generally short, we have ignored the duration eﬀect, and focused
on short range correlations. We proposed several schemes for coarse-graining the amino acid alphabet in
order to include multi-residue correlation. Such reduction has been used in the Bayesian segmentation of
protein secondary structure (Schmidler, et. al., 2000). However, here we derived the coarse-graining schemes
specially for scoring residues to ﬁt conformations. We have discussed only the principle of taking proper
mutual information as an objective function for clustering, but did not exhaust all possibilities for clustering.
For example, to diminish parameters, one may consider residue triplets at conformation quintuplet states.
Another possibility is to use quartuples for both residues and conformations. One can also cluster quintuplet
conformation states to less states.

There are rooms for further improvement of our approach. Simple weights (3 values) may be introduced
to adjust residue scores according to its single-site conformation. Moreover, we may divide a training set into
several, say 2, subsets according to residue statistics. Again, for this purpose the coarse-graining schemes
help. The two subsets are then used separately for training to get reﬁned models. We ﬁrst classify a query
sequence into one of the two categories, and then apply to it the corresponding reﬁned model. We have tested
this on the simple triplet models. The primitive result of up to 2% in accuracy improvement is encouraging.
This, and the protein family recognition using multiple reduced amino acid residues, are under study.

Table 6. Accuracy of secondary structure predictions for diﬀerent models. Here, VI and BW stand for
‘Viterbi’ and ‘Baum-Welch’ algorithms, respectively. For all models 68-k, conformation-dependent reduc-
tions are used except for model 68-81×21* where the single conformation-independent reduction is used.

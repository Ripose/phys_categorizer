ABSTRACT
The signaling apparatus mediating bacterial chemotaxis can adapt to a wide range of persistent
external stimuli. In many cases, the bacterial activity returns to its pre-stimulus level exactly and
this “perfect adaptability” is robust against variations in various chemotaxis protein concentrations.
We model the bacterial chemotaxis signaling pathway, from ligand binding to CheY phosphorylation.
By solving the steady-state equations of the model analytically, we derive a full set of conditions
for the system to achieve perfect adaptation. The conditions related to the phosphorylation part
of the pathway are discovered for the ﬁrst time, while other conditions are generalization of the
ones found in previous works. Sensitivity of the perfect adaptation is evaluated by perturbing
these conditions. We ﬁnd that, even in the absence of some of the perfect adaptation conditions,
adaptation can be achieved with near perfect precision as a result of the separation of scales in
both chemotaxis protein concentrations and reaction rates, or speciﬁc properties of the receptor
distribution in diﬀerent methylation states. Since near perfect adaptation can be found in much
larger regions of the parameter space than that deﬁned by the perfect adaptation conditions, their
existence is essential to understand robustness in bacterial chemotaxis.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The motion of coliform bacteria (such as E-coli) is
driven by rotation of several ﬂagella attached to the
cell body. When the ﬂagella rotate counter-clockwise
(CCW), the ﬂagella form a bundle that pushes the bac-
terium in a smooth motion (runs) with a high degree of
directionality. On the other hand, when the ﬂagella ro-
tate clockwise (CW), the ﬂagella bundle ﬂies apart and
the bacterium tumbles, randomizing the direction of the
subsequent run. The frequency with which the tumbling
motion occurs decreases with increasing concentration of
attractant (or decreasing concentration of repellent). As
the result, the bacterium performs a biased random walk
towards higher concentration of attractant. This mecha-
nism gives the bacterium its ability to follow the gradient
of chemical concentration, i.e., chemotaxis.

From the sensing of external stimulus to the activation
of motor regulator protein, a series of chemical reactions
are involved in relaying and regulating the signal. For
recent review on bacterial chemotaxis signaling pathway,
see references (Falke, 1997; Bren, 2000; Bourret, 2002).
The major players in the chemotaxis signal transduction
pathway are the transmembrane chemotaxis receptors
and 6 cytosolic proteins: CheA, CheB, CheR, CheW,
CheY and CheZ. The receptor forms a complex with
the histidine kinase CheA through the adaptor protein
CheW. The receptor has a ligand binding domain located
at the periplasm to sense the external signal, such as the
concentration of attractant (or repellent). The activity
of CheA is aﬀected by the properties of the receptor, for
example, whether the receptor is ligand bound or not.
When chemoattractant binds to receptor, CheA activ-
ity is suppressed. The histidine kinase CheA, once acti-
vated, acquires a phosphate group through autophospho-
rylation, and subsequently transfers the phosphate group

to the response regulator protein CheY or the demethyla-
tion enzyme CheB. The phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P)
then interacts with the motor and increases the motor’s
CW rotation bias. This is the “linear” signal transfer
part of the bacterial chemotaxis pathway. Like many
other biological sensory systems, the bacterial chemo-
taxis pathway also has the ability to adapt to persistent
external stimulus. The adaptation in bacterial chemo-
taxis is facilitated by the methylation and demethylation
of the receptor, which serves as the feedback control of
the system. The methylation and demethylation pro-
cesses are catalyzed by CheR and CheB-P respectively
and are slow in comparison with the other reactions.

Because of the excellent understanding of each individ-
ual reaction of the pathway, mathematical modelling of
bacterial chemotaxis signal transduction has been very
fruitful (Bray, 1993; Hauri, 1995; Barkai, 1997; Spiro,
1997; Morton-Firth, 1998; Morton-Firth, 1999; Yi, 2000).
Besides being useful in understanding speciﬁc aspects of
chemotaxis experiments, modelling is essential in gain-
ing insight about general properties of biochemical net-
works. One important general problem is to understand
the functional stability of biochemical networks under
changes of various pathway parameters, such as concen-
trations of enzymes and reaction rates. Parameter ﬂuc-
tuations are inherent for biological systems in the real
world, so robustness, i.e., the insensitivity of important
system properties with respect to parameter variation
and ﬂuctuation of protein concentrations, is crucial for
the proper functioning of the biological systems.

Experimentally, it was observed that after initial re-
sponse to some external stimulus, such as sudden changes
of aspartate concentrations, the bacteria tumbling fre-
quency often reverts to its original value with high ac-
curacy, independent of the strength of the external stim-
ulus (Berg, 1972). This accurate adaptation is gener-

ally believed to contribute to the high sensitivity of bac-
terial chemotaxis to a wide range of external stimulus
(5 orders of magnitude). In a recent work, Barkai and
Leibler (Barkai, 1997) investigated the robustness of per-
fect adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis, they used a two-
state (active or inactive) model (Asukura, 1984) for the
receptor complex in explaining the phenomena. In their
model, they assumed that CheB only demethylates active
receptors, whereas CheR methylates all receptors indis-
criminately. They showed, by extensive simulation of the
two-state model, that as long as the above conditions are
satisﬁed, adaptation is achieved with high precision, inde-
pendent of speciﬁc values of the rate constants or enzyme
concentrations. In a subsequent study, Alon et al. (1999)
provided experimental evidence for the robustness of the
perfect adaptation over large variations in chemotactic
protein concentrations.

The Barkai-Leibler (BL) model clearly captured one of
the essential ingredients for perfect adaptation in bacte-
rial chemotaxis. Recently, Yi, Huang, Simon and Doyle
(Yi, 2000) further studied the Barkai-Leibler model ana-
lytically, and summarized all the conditions for perfect
adaptation within the BL model beyond those identi-
ﬁed in the original paper. However, the BL model is
a simpliﬁed description of the real chemotaxis pathway.
For example, the BL model neglects the phosphorylation
part of the pathway altogether and assumes the satura-
tion of methylation enzyme CheR, which is questionable
(Morton-Firth, 1999).

In this work, we study a more complete model of the
chemotaxis signal transduction pathway, similar to the
deterministic version of the model proposed by Morton-
Firth et al.
(1998), where both the methylation and
phosphorylation processes are taken into account. Our
goals are to understand whether (mathematically) per-
fect adaptation, deﬁned as when steady-state CheY-P
concentration is independent of ligand concentration, can
be achieved for the full model, and to identify the condi-
tions for such perfect adaptation. The sensitivity of the
perfect adaptability, or robustness, is then studied by
perturbing these conditions. Such study can help us un-
derstand adaptation in real biological systems where not
all the perfect adaptation conditions are satisﬁed, it can
also provide possible explanations for cases where per-
fect adaptation is not achieved, e. g., for serine response
(Berg, 1972).

II. MODEL

For the purpose of this study, we consider only those
receptors that form complex with CheW and CheA. We
label the receptor complex by Tnλ, where n(∈ [0, 4]) is
the number of methyl groups added to the receptor and
λ (= o, v) represents the ligand occupied (o) and vacant
(v) state of the receptor. Superscripts are also used to
describe whether the receptor complex is phosphorylated
(P ) or un-phosphorylated (U ), bound to CheR/CheB-P

or free (F ). Superscript (T ) is used to label total con-
centrations of diﬀerent proteins. The superscripts are
not mutually exclusive, e. g., [BP F ] is the concentration
of phosphorylated free (not bound to receptor) CheB. In
table I, some of the chemical species of the chemotaxis
pathway are shown, where the values of the total con-
centrations are taken from (Morton-Firth, 1999), except
for the total CheR concentration, which we have reduced
slightly in order to have the same average methylation
level as reported in (Morton-Firth, 1999), where recep-
tors other than Tar were included in the simulation.

The bacterial chemotaxis pathway can be divided into
3 processes: receptor ligand binding, receptor methyla-
tion/demethylation and phosphorylation of CheA, CheB
and CheY. The reactions involved in each of the three
processes are listed in table II. Since the ligand bind-
ing process is much faster than the other two, the lig-
and binding reaction can be considered to be always in
quasi-equilibrium. The receptor’s ligand binding status
directly aﬀects both the CheA auto-phosphorylation rate
and the receptor methylation/demethylation rates. The
CheA auto-phosphorylation rate is also aﬀected by the
methylation state of the receptor. Finally, since only the
phosphorylated CheB can eﬃciently demethylate the re-
ceptor, the methylation process is also aﬀected by the

phosphorylation process.

Some conformational change of the receptor complex
is probably responsible for the signaling from binding of
ligand to methylation and phosphorylation of the recep-
tor complex (Bren, 2000; Falke, 1997; Liu, 1997). The
two-state model proposes that the receptor complex has
two states, active and inactive, with only the active state
capable of auto-phosphorylation. For a receptor with n
methyl groups and a ligand occupancy status described
by λ (vacant, v, or occupied, o), the probability of being
active is denoted by Pnλ. However, there has been no
direct experimental evidence in support of the two-state
model (Yi, 2000). More generally, 0 ≤ Pnλ ≤ 1 can be
simply understood as the relative receptor activity for
receptor Tnλ and the CheA auto-phosphorylation rate is
proportional to Pnλ:

nλ = kP Pnλ,
kP

(1)

where kP is a constant independent of n and λ.

In the following, we write down all the equations for

the reactions listed in table I.

1. The ligand binding reaction is given by:

Tnv + Ligand

Tno

(2)

kf,n
−−→←−−

Since the time scale for ligand binding is much
shorter than the other reactions, the ligand binding
reaction can be assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium
and the two populations for each methylation level
can then be written as:

[Tnv] = (1 − Ln)[Tn],
[Tno] = Ln[Tn],

(3)
(4)

[L]
[L]+Kd,n

where Ln ≡
, is the receptor occupancy
rate, [L] is the ligand concentration and [Tn] =
[Tno] + [Tnv] is the total receptor population in
methylation level n. The ligand receptor dissocia-
tion constant Kd,n(≡ kb,n/kf,n) probably depends
on the methylation level of the receptor n (Dunten,
1991; Borkovich, 1992; Bornhorst, 2000; Sourjik,
2002), however it will become clear later that this
does not aﬀect the perfect adaptation conditions.

2. The methylation/demethylation reactions can be

written as:

Tn + E ⇋ TnE → Tn±1 + E

(5)

where the enzyme E is either R (CheR) or
B (CheB-P). Here we assume the methyla-
tion/demethylation process at the 4 methylation
sites follows a preferred sequence, and therefore the
existence of only 5 methylation states described
by n ∈ [0, 4]. Though this assumption is still

iments (Shapiro, 1994; Shapiro, 1995). The net-
work of methylation/demethylation reactions are
illustrated in Fig. 1.

If we assume the above reactions follow Michaelis-
Menten kinetics and the dissociation rates for the
bound state are independent of λ, i.e., whether the

To describe the kinetics of the signal transduction
pathway in full, we need to consider the interactions
among the concentrations of all the 65 states for the 4
chemical species: 60 receptor states = 2 ligand binding
states × 5 methylation states × 3 enzyme binding states
× 2 phosphorylation states, 1 free CheR state, 2 free
CheB states and 2 CheY states. Using the fact that lig-
and binding kinetics is fast and the enzymatic reactions
are governed by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the number
of independent receptor concentrations is reduced from
60 to just 10, consisting of the 5 free methylation states
and the 5 phosphorylation states. Now, the whole system
is described by kinetic equations Eq. 10 and Eq. 17-19
plus conservation equations given by Eq. 7-9 and Eq. 20.
Concentration of the phosphorylated CheY ([YP ]),
which determines the tumbling frequency of bacteria, can
be considered as the output of the whole chemotaxis sig-
nal transduction pathway. In the next section, we study
how the steady state concentration of CheY-P depends
on the external ligand concentration [L], in particular,
we derive a set of conditions for [YP ] to be independent
of [L], i.e., perfect adaptation.

III. CONDITIONS FOR PERFECT
ADAPTATION

All the concentrations in our model fall naturally into
two categories: the local variables deﬁned for one partic-
ular methylation level, such as [Tn], the concentration of
receptors with n methyl groups, and the global variables,
such as [RF ], the concentration of the free CheR. The
system adapts by adjusting the local variables with the
ligand concentration, e. g., the steady-state values of [Tn]
varies with [L]. However, perfect adaptation is achieved
when the equilibrium value of [YP ], a global variable, is
independent of the ligand concentration (Othmer, 1998).
This is generally not possible because the global variables
are coupled with the local ones. One goal of this paper
is to discover the conditions under which [Y P ] becomes
independent of L.

The strategy in obtaining the perfect adaptation con-
ditions is to consider only global equations, such as the

P

conservation equations of the chemical species (e.g., Eq.
7, 8 and 20) and the steady-state equations of global vari-
ables (e.g., Eq. 17 and 18), which do not depend on any
one speciﬁc methylation level. In these global equations,
there is no explicit dependence on ligand concentration,
and composite variables, such as
in Eq. 7,
enter as weighted sums of the methylation level speciﬁc
receptor concentrations. Another kind of global equation
can be constructed by summing steady-state equations at
all methylation levels (e.g., Eq. 9, 11 and 19). The price
to pay for such global equations is the introduction of
new composite variables. However, if the reaction rates
involved in diﬀerent reactions are related in certain ways,
the same composite variables appear in diﬀerent global
equations so that there are enough global equations to
determine all the independent global and composite vari-
ables. In other words, if certain conditions between reac-
tion rates are satisﬁed, the steady-state concentrations of
all the global and composite variables including [Y P ] can
be independent of the ligand concentration, i.e., perfect
adaptation.

We leave the detailed derivation for the perfect adap-
tation conditions to the appendix. In the following, we
list these conditions, discuss their meaning and compare
them with those found in previous works (Barkai, 1997;
Yi, 2000). The perfect adaptation conditions can be
grouped for each of the three pathway processes: condi-
tion 1 is for the ligand binding and unbinding, conditions
2-4 are required for the methylation process and condi-
tions 5-6 are related to the phosphorylation process:

1. The time scale for ligand binding is much shorter
than the methylation and phosphorylation time
scale. This condition allows us to neglect ligand
binding/unbinding kinetics.

2. The association rates between the receptor and the
methylation/demethylation enzymes, CheR and
CheB-P , are linearly related to the activity of the
receptor and are zero for n = 4 and n = 0, re-
spectively: K R
∝
Pnλ − P0λ. The dissociation rates of the enzyme
receptor bound states are independent of λ.

3. The receptor activities of the non-methylated and
the maximally methylated receptors are indepen-
dent of λ: P0v = P0o, P4v = P4o.

lation level (kB

This condition can only be strictly satisﬁed when

Condition 1 is necessary to decouple the ligand bind-
ing process from the rest of the reactions. This is veri-
ﬁed experimentally and assumed in all the previous mod-
els (Barkai, 1997; Morton-Firth, 1998; Spiro, 1997; Yi,
2000).

Condition 2 for the methylation process requires that
the CheR and CheB methylation/demethylation rates
depend linearly on the receptor’s auto-phosphorylation
rate (activity) . This is a generalization of the key ingre-
dient for perfect adaptation found in Barkai and Leibler’s
work (Barkai, 1997). In the special case of P4λ = 1 and
P0λ = 0, condition 2 means that CheB-P only bind to ac-
tive receptors and CheR only bind to inactive receptors,
the latter is missed in the original work of BL and later
found to be necessary for perfect adaptation in (Morton-
Firth, 1999) through a direct numerical simulation of the
full system.

The requirement in condition 3 that P0λ and P4λ be
independent of λ is needed so that both the ligand-bound
and vacant receptors have the same range of activity.
This requirement for perfect adaptation is necessary in
case the extreme methylation states n = 0 or n = 4
become populated with receptors.

Condition 4 was ﬁrst pointed out in (Yi, 2000), it is a
more general form of the assumption that both kR
n and
kB
n are independent of n made in the original BL model.
The justiﬁcation of this condition may be related to a
common evolutionary origin of CheR and CheB, result-
ing in a similar anchoring position to the receptor for
CheR methylating site n and CheB-P demethylating site
n + 1 (Shapiro, 1994; Shapiro, 1995; Djordjevic, 1998;
Barnakov, 1999).

Condition 5 for the phosphorylation process is very
similar to condition 2, in the sense that the phosphate
transfer rates of the receptors have to be linearly related
to their activity. This condition was not discovered be-
fore because the phosphorylation process was neglected
in previous works (Barkai, 1997; Yi, 2000).

Condition 6 can only be satisﬁed exactly when one
tunes the parameters such that the pre-factor in front of
the sum in Eq. 21 is zero. This condition was overlooked
by most of the previous studies because the activities
of the CheR or CheB-P bound receptors were neglected.
However, in equilibrium, the population of enzyme bound
receptors can be as high as 30% (Morton-Firth, 1999).

By imposing all the conditions above, the steady state
concentrations of the global variables will be independent
of the ligand concentration, and are determined by 15
parameters: the 4 total concentrations of table I, and 11

reaction rates of table III, including P4 and P0, but not
the relative activity values for the rest of the methylation
states. However, for real biological system, these condi-
tions for perfect adaptation may not be strictly satisﬁed.
In order to understand bacteria’s ability in adapting ac-
curately under diﬀerent internal and external conditions,
i. e., robustness, we need to evaluate the eﬀect of violat-
ing these perfect adaptation conditions.

IV. EFFECTS OF VIOLATING THE PERFECT
ADAPTATION CONDITIONS

Since it is not feasible to explore the whole parameter
space, we choose to mostly perturb around the param-
eter values that have been used in previous studies. To
this end, we take most of our parameters from (Morton-
Firth, 1999), which are listed here in Table II and Table
III. Hereafter we refer to this set of parameters as the
reference parameters. Assuming ligand occupancy rate
Ln = L is independent of n, the steady state receptor
distributions in diﬀerent methylation states for diﬀerent
ligand occupancy rates L is shown in Fig. 2 A for the ref-
erence parameters. In Fig. 2 B, the population-weighted
average receptor activities Pn(L) = PnoL + Pnv(1 − L)
for methylation level n ∈ [0, 4] is also shown. As is
clear from Fig. 2, when ligand (attractant) occupancy
rate increases, the average receptor activity Pn(L) de-
creases for each methylation level n, and the system
adapts by shifting the receptor population towards higher
methylation states in achieving constant total activity
4
[T A] =
n=0Pn(L)[Tn]. The steady state concentra-
tions of all the other relevant concentrations at 3 dif-
ferent ligand occupancy fractions are given in Table IV
for the reference parameters, the small changes in [Y P ]
at diﬀerent ligand concentrations are caused by viola-
tion of conditions 5 and 6 in the reference model used in
(Morton-Firth, 1999) as we explain later in the section

P

“Violating condition 5”.

We have also constructed another model by modifying
some of the reference parameters so that all the perfect
conditions are satisﬁed. The results of perturbing this
new model are essentially the same as for the reference
model, mainly because the adaptation error in the refer-
ence model is very small (< 1%). While this new model
is mathematically more rigorous for isolating diﬀerent er-
ror sources, the reference model has the advantage that it
is motivated biologically (from experiments or common
sense), and therefore serves as a better starting point in
exploring the parameter regions that are more likely to
be biologically relevant. To make sure violation of condi-
tions 5 and 6 in the reference model does not contaminate
the eﬀect of other conditions too much, we have always
checked the error with and without violating the condi-
tion in consideration, and made sure most of the error
does come from violating the perfect condition we study.
Since ligand binding is much faster than other relevant
processes of the system, we do not consider the unreal-
istic situation of violating condition 1.
In the follow-
ing, we study the eﬀects of breaking the other 5 perfect
adaptation conditions. Our goal is to understand the
general reason behind the robustness of the system with
respect to breaking each perfect adaptation condition.
Even though we primarily perturb the system around
the reference parameters, we also explore other parame-
ter regions, especially when the reference model becomes
insensitive to violation of a given condition. This strat-
egy allows us to gain the general understanding of where
in the parameter space a given perfect adaptation condi-
tion becomes important and the reason behind it.

depend linearly on the activity of the receptor. For
the reference parameters, where P0 = 0 and P4 = 1,
condition 2 simply means that CheR only binds to
inactive receptors and CheB-P only binds to active
receptors. The simplest way in violating condition 2 is
to allow CheR bind to active receptor or CheB-P bind
to inactive ones , which can be formally expressed as:

−1

K R

nλ

K B

nλ

−1

= K R
−1

= K B

br(1 − Pnλ + ar),
−1

bb(Pnλ + ab),

(22)

where ar ≥ 0 and ab ≥ 0 are the measures of violating
condition 2; br and bb are normalization factors tuned
with respect to ar and ab to keep the total activity of
the system constant at a given ligand occupancy rate
(L=0.5) for comparison purpose. ar = 0 and ab = 0 cor-
responds to condition 2 being satisﬁed; ar → ∞ (with
arbr = const.) or ab → ∞ (with abbb = const.) respec-
tively corresponds to CheR or CheB-P binding to all re-
ceptors equally.

In Fig. 3, we show the steady-state concentration of
CheY-P versus the ligand occupancy rate L for vari-
ous values of ar and ab. Even for the extreme cases
of ar = ∞ or ab = ∞, respectively corresponding to
CheR or CheB-P binding to both active and inactive re-
ceptors equally, the deviation from perfect adaptation is
only ∼ 10% − 15%. Intuitively, the reason for the near
perfect adaptation is that the control of the system’s
total activity can be carried out by either the methy-
lation (CheR) or demethylation (CheB-P) process, pro-
vided that at least one of the enzymes’ binding rates
is strongly correlated with the receptor activity. If the
receptor binding rates of both enzymes become indepen-
dent of the receptor’s activity, i. e., both ar = ∞ and
ab = ∞, the system is only controlled through the weak

eﬀect of CheB phosphorylation and does not adapt very
well.

Specifcally, condition 2 requires that CheR does not
bind to the fully methylated receptors (n=4), and CheB-
P does not bind to the unmethylated receptors (n=0).
Therefore, the quantitative eﬀects of breaking condition
2 (as in Eq. 22) depends on the receptor concentration at
the fully methylated state [T4] or the unmethylated states
[T0] (see appendix for details). Both [T0] and [T4] are
relatively small for the reference parameters with [T4] >
[T0] (see Fig. 2), which explains the qualitative features
in Fig. 3. The eﬀect of ab → ∞ only becomes noticeable
because [T0] is not too small for ab → ∞.

B. Violation of condition 3

Since adaptation for bacterial chemotaxis relies on bal-
ancing the eﬀect of ligand binding on the receptor’s ac-
tivity with that of the methylation of the receptor, a
necessary condition for perfect adaptation is for both lig-
and bound and vacant receptors to have the same range
of activity, i.e., condition 3. For the reference parame-
ters, condition 3 is obeyed by having: P0v = P0o = 0;
P4v = P4o = 1. Without changing the monotonic depen-
dence of the receptor activity on their methylation level,
we can break condition 3 at n = 0 by increasing P0v from
0 to 1
8 ; or at n = 4 by decreasing P4o from 1 to 7
8 . The
enzyme binding rates are adjusted accordingly in keep-
ing condition 2 satisﬁed. The eﬀects are shown in Fig. 4.
The system is insensitive to the opening of the activity
gap ∆P0 ≡ P0v − P0o at n = 0, because the receptor
population is small at n = 0 even at L = 0. For the
same opening of activity gap ∆P4 ≡ P4v − P4o at n = 4,
the adaptation error is 6%. In particular, the system has

where ar = ∞ corresponds to CheR binds to all receptor indiscriminately.

lower CheY-P concentration at higher ligand occupancy
rate L, because the receptor population shifts towards
higher methylation levels at larger L, and the eﬀect of
methylation is not large enough to cancel the decrease
of activity caused by ligand binding. Quantitatively, the
adaptation error increases with the activity gap; e.g., it
reaches 25% when we lower P4o further to 0.5.

C. Violation of condition 4

n /kR

The methylation and demethylation catalytic rates kR
n
and kB
n can depend on methylation level n. From Eq. 11,
the steady-state properties of the system only depend on
the ratios: rn = kB
n−1 for n = 1, 2, 3, 4. Condition
4 for perfect adaptation requires that rn be a constant
independent of n, a kind of “detailed balance” condition.
Indeed, if we change kR
n and kB
n while keeping rn con-
stant, the system adapts perfectly. However, when we
make rn depend on n, perfect adaptation is lost. In Fig.
5, we show the eﬀects of increasing one rn by a factor of
2 while keeping the rest rn unchanged at their reference
value for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. The quantitative de-
viation from perfect adaptation depends on n, with the
largest deviation of ∼ 25% occurring at n = 2 , possibly
because the receptors are highly populated at n = 2 for
the reference parameters.

D. Violating condition 5

Condition 5 requires that the phosphate transfer rates
of a receptor is proportional to its auto-phosphorylation

rate, a kind of compatibility condition. The simplest
way to break condition 5 is to set the phosphate transfer
rates to be a constant independent of both the ligand
binding and the methylation level of the receptor. This
assumption is also made in (Morton-Firth, 1998; Morton-
Firth, 1999).

For the reference parameters, the steady-state [Y P ]
change by less than 1% over the whole range of ligand

insensitivity of the system’s perfect adaptation with re-
spect to this particular choice of breaking condition 5. In
the following, we explain the system’s near perfect adap-
tation by the existence of approximate global equations.
In deriving condition 5, a global equation is formed by
summing Eq. 19 over all methylation levels and replacing
[T U
n ], which leads to the formation of 4 com-

tion 5 is needed to make G1, G2 and G3 proportional
to each other, so that the total number of global equa-
tions is enough to solve for all the independent global and
composite variables (see section “Conditions for perfect
adaptations” and Appendix for details). When condition
5 is broken by setting kP B
to be constant, G2
and G3 are still proportional to each other, but they are
now diﬀerent from G1, the total number of global equa-
tions are now not enough in solving for all the global vari-
ables, and local equations have to be used. This leads to
all the global variable depend on ligand concentration,
i.e., non-perfect adaptation. However, because the con-
centration of (un-phosphorylated) CheY is much larger
than the receptor concentrations, the phosphorylated re-
ceptor concentration [T P
n ] is small compared with the
total receptor concentration [Tn], due to eﬃcient phos-
phate transfer from CheA to CheY and the subsequent
high CheY-P dephosphorylation rate. As a result, G1
is negligible relative to G0, leading to an approximate

text for detail). The parameters used are: (1) For curve a,

global equation with the same degree of reduction in in-
dependent composite variables and eventually the near
perfect adaption observed in Fig. 6 A.

However, reducing CheY concentration alone does not
change too much the system’s ability in perfect adapta-
tion, as shown in Fig. 6 (curve b). At low CheY concen-
tration, the phosphate group of CheA-P goes to CheB.
Because of the slow dephosphorylation rate of CheB-P,
most of the CheB become phosphorylated in steady state,
essentially decoupling the phosphorylation process from
the adaptation process. The adaptation of the system
therefore becomes insensitive to the phosphorylation re-
lated condition 5.

To amplify the eﬀect of violating condition 5, we re-
duce the overall activity to [T A] = 0.014[T T ] at L = 0
by making kR = 0.02kR
Ref. The result is shown in Fig.
6 (curve c). The adaptation accuracy can also depend
on other parameters, such as the receptor activity Pnλ.
In Fig. 6 (curve d), we show that a slight change in
receptor activity leads to higher deviation from perfect
adaptation.

E. Violating condition 6

The total receptor activity [T A](≡

4
n=0Pn[Tn]) is di-
rectly related to the ﬁnal production of CheY-P. How-
ever, only part of [T A] can be expressed in terms of other

the total free receptor concentration [T F ] ≡

and the total activity due to free receptors [T AF ] ≡

activity of the enzyme (CheR or CheB-P) bound recep-
P
tors (see appendix for details), which is proportional to
KR + [BP F ]
ξ′ =
n ] with a pre-factor
(cid:17)
(see Eq. 21). Condition 6 is required to eliminate this
extra global variable ξ′ by setting the pre-factor to zero.
The eﬀect of breaking condition 6 can be small, be-
cause as [RF ] deviates from its perfect adaption value
[RF ]Adap, so does [BP F ] with the same trend, leading
to small changes of the pre-factor in ξ. Also, part of ξ′
can be approximated by a linear combination of [T F ] and
[T AF ], depending on the activity levels of diﬀerent recep-
tors Pnλ. Finally, for higher total activity, the relative
eﬀect of ξ will be small. For the reference parameters,
the accuracy of adaptation is better than 98% for 4-fold
change of CheR concentration from its perfect adapta-
tion value, as shown in Fig. 7 A. The adaptation accu-
racy decreases as we lower the total activity by decreas-
ing methylation rate kR, as shown in Fig. 7 B. Finally,
when we increase the activity diﬀerences between the lig-
and bound and the vacant receptors by setting: Pno = 0
(n = 0, 1, 2, 3), P4o = 1; Pnv = 1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4), P0v = 0,
the same change in [RT ] can cause more than a 50% error
in adaptation, as shown in Fig. 7 C.

V. COMPARISON TO STOCHASTIC
SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTS

The results from the previous sections can be compared
with both the discrete stochastic numerical simulation
and real experiments. We use the reference parameters
for all the comparison studies.

A. Comparison to stochastic simulation

Stochsim (Morton-Firth, 1998) is a general purpose
stochastic simulator for chemical reactions. For our
study, the volume of Stochsim simulation is set to
be 1.4−15 L, and the number of molecules is therefore
843×concentration (in µM).

In Fig. 8 A, we show the Stochsim simulation result
for the reference parameters, which agrees well with the
results from simulating our continuum equations with the
same parameters. In Fig. 8 B, we show the Stochsim
simulation result for the parameters used in Fig. 7 C
with [RT ] = 4[RT ]Adap, where perfect adaptation is lost
because of violation of condition 6. As predicted from
our deterministic model, after sudden changes of ligand
occupancy rate L, [Y P ] does not always return to its
pre-stimulus level; in fact, the maximum error (∼ 50%)
is observed when L = 0.2, consistent with Fig. 7 C.

For most of the results shown in this paper, we have

10

compared with the results from stochastic simulation us-
ing Stochsim (data not shown). Overall, the averaged
behaviors of Stochsim simulations are consistent with our
continuum model, which is interesting given the non-
linear nature of the chemical kinetics. Further work is
needed in characterizing the ﬂuctuation of the individual
Stochsim simulations, and compare them with the ﬂuc-
tuations in behavior among diﬀerent individual bacteria
(Morton-Firth, 1998).

B. Comparison with experiment

In a recent experimental study by Alon et al (Alon,
1999), mutant bacteria lacking a certain chemotaxis pro-
tein, such as CheR, CheB, CheY or CheZ, are used, and
the missing protein is reintroduced in a controlled fashion
through a plasmid inserted into the mutant bacteria cells.
This technique allowed these authors to study the eﬀect
of various enzyme concentration changes on the chemo-
taxis behavior of the bacteria. Speciﬁcally, the tumbling
frequency of the bacteria is measured through a sudden
increase of ligand concentration, which eﬀectively corre-
sponds to a sudden change of ligand occupancy rate from
L = 0 to L = 1.

In Fig.

9 A, we show the adaptation precision as
the ratio between phosphorylated CheY level before and
after the stimulus for various CheR and CheB concen-
trations. For CheR concentration change of up to 50
fold with respect to the reference value, the adaptation
error is ≤ 3%, somewhat smaller than the experimen-
tally measured adaptation error cited in (Alon, 1999). If
[BT ], instead of [RT ], is changed, the adaptation error
would be much bigger, as shown in Fig. 9 A. This is
the case because for large values of [BT ], the low activ-
ity and the large values of [BP F ] make the violation of
condition 5 and 6 more signiﬁcant. This could explain
the larger (1.09) adaptation precision reported in (Alon,
1999) when [BT ] expression is 12 times that of the wild
type values. Since we deﬁne adaptation accuracy based
on CheY-P concentration, the quantitative diﬀerence be-
tween the adaptation error observed in (Alon, 1999) and
those of our model could be explained by the signal am-
pliﬁcation at the motor level (Cluzel, 2000).

The relaxation time of the system after a sudden
change in ligand concentration can be determined by
direct simulation of the full kinetic equation or by lin-
earizing the methylation/demethylation kinetic equa-
tions around the steady state. The dependence of both
the steady-state tumbling frequency and the linear re-
laxation time on CheR concentration [RT ] is shown in
Fig. 9 B. They agree qualitatively with the steady state
tumbling frequency and the relaxation time measured in
(Alon, 1999), as depicted in Fig. 2 B of their paper,
although direct quantitative comparison is not possible
due to diﬀerent deﬁnitions of relaxation time and lack
of detailed understanding on how CheY-P regulates the
motor.

VI. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

problem.

In this paper, we have studied a theoretical model de-
scribing the full chemotaxis signal transduction pathway.
Through systematic analysis of the steady state proper-
ties of the model, we derive a complete set of conditions
for the system to adapt exactly. Some of the conditions
are generalizations of the ones discovered before, but oth-
ers, in particular, the conditions related to the phospho-
rylation part of the pathway, are discovered for the ﬁrst
time here. It is quite remarkable that perfect adaptation
can be achieved for arbitrary ligand concentration with a
small set of conditions, far less than the number of vari-
ables and the number of reaction rate constants in the

The (intrinsic) state of a receptor can be described
by its ligand binding status (λ) and methylation level
(n). The (external) properties of the receptor com-
plex include its abilities to interact with the methyla-
tion/demethylation enzymes, to undergo autophosphory-
lation, and to transfer its own phosphate group to CheY
or CheB, all of which depends on the (internal) state of
the receptor characterized by n and λ. Perfect adapta-
tion requires these three properties of the receptor com-
plex to be correlated with each other in a linear fashion
for any given receptor state {nλ} (condition 2 and 5).
Available experimental data that addresses the validity
of such connections has been discussed extensively in (Yi,

2000). Even though the evidence for such connections is
not well established and the correlation may not be lin-
ear, it is conceivable that a high degree of correlation
exists among these three properties of the receptor, be-
cause they are determined by the same conformational
change of the receptor protein complex for a given recep-
tor state {nλ}.

Since most of the perfect adaptation conditions are
relations between diﬀerent reaction rates, the system’s
ability to adapt accurately can be considered “robust” in

the sense that the perfect adaptation is independent of
concentrations of any speciﬁc chemotaxis protein, which
can ﬂuctuate between diﬀerent individual cells and at dif-
ferent stage of the cell development. Only one of the per-
fect adaptation conditions requires the ﬁne tuning of the
methylation enzyme concentrations (condition 6). Be-
cause of this condition, in the strict mathematical sense,
the perfect adaptation of the system can only be achieved
via ﬁne tuning of a parameter, and therefore cannot be
considered robust. However, as we have shown in this

paper, the eﬀect of violating this condition can be rather
small, especially at the reference parameters.

The discovery of the perfect adaptation conditions pro-
vides an invaluable starting point in exploring the param-
eter space. We evaluate the sensitivity of the system’s
perfect adaptation ability by perturbing the perfect adap-
tation conditions. We ﬁnd that the system can adapt
near perfectly even in the absence of some of the per-
fect adaptation conditions. In ﬁnding the perfect adap-
tation conditions, we focus on studying equations which
do not depend on any individual methylation levels, these
global equations are obtained by either conservation laws
or summing steady-state equations over diﬀerent methy-
lation levels. The same approach is also useful in under-
standing the near perfect adaptation when the perfect
adaptation conditions are violated. Technically, we can
explain the near perfect adaptation by the existence of
approximate global equations replacing the ones lost due
to the violation of perfect adaptation conditions. Bio-
logically, these approximate global equations are caused
by various intrinsic properties of the system, such as sep-
aration of scales in protein concentrations and reaction
rates, or speciﬁc properties of the receptor distribution
in diﬀerent methylation states. Since real biological sys-
tems are not likely to satisfy all the perfect adaptation
conditions exactly, the abundance of such near perfect
adaptation regions in the parameter space strongly lim-
its the range of activity variation and is probably respon-
sible for the robustness of the system’s ability to adapt
almost perfectly.

Through systematic study of the system’s behavior
when diﬀerent perfect adaptation conditions are violated,
we have also identiﬁed parameter regions where signiﬁ-
cant deviation from perfect adaptation occurs. This may
provide possible explanations to bacterial chemotaxis re-
sponses that does not adapt accurately, such as the serine
response as reported in (Berg, 1972), and constitute con-
crete predictions that can be experimentally veriﬁed.

Aside from perfect adaptation, another challenge for
modelling bacterial chemotaxis is to understand the large
signal ampliﬁcation from ligand concentration change to
the change in bacterium ﬂagella rotation bias. To di-
rectly compare between experiments and simulation, de-
tailed information between CheY-P concentration and
the motor rotation bias is needed. Recently, the con-
nection between CheY-P level and the motor activity
was investigated in (Scharf, 1998; Alon, 1998; Cluzel,
2000).
In (Cluzel, 2000), where rotation bias of single
bacterium was measured for diﬀerent [YP ] concentra-
tions, it was shown that the motor bias for individual bac-
terium should be ﬁtted by a Hill function with a large Hill
coeﬃcient (∼ 10). This highly nonlinear function may
explain the advantage of perfect adaptation in amplify-
ing the gain, and also the nonlinear dependence of BCCW,
the CCW rotation bias, on changes in ligand occupancy
as found in (Jasuja, 1999). However, quantitatively, from
(Cluzel, 2000), the maximum signal ampliﬁcation from
change in [Y P ] to the tumbling frequency is measured to

13

be: dBccw/d ln[Y P ] ≈ 2.2. With the reference parame-
ters in our model, this leads to a total signal ampliﬁcation
of dBCCW/d ln[Y P ] × d ln[Y P ]/dL ≈ 2.2 × 0.65 ≈ 1.43,
which is still much too small as compared with the total
signal ampliﬁcation measured in experiments, e.g., ∼ 30
as reported in (Jasuja, 1999).

The gain of the system could come from receptor clus-
tering as suggested in (Bray, 1998). However, to reconcile
the existence of high gain and the wide dynamic range of
response, it is highly desirable to have high gain for the
signal transduction pathway itself. One of the interest-
ing ﬁndings of our study is that if the system satisﬁes all
the perfect adaptation conditions, the steady state ac-
tivity of the system is independent of the exact values
of the receptor activity Pnλ for n ∈ [1, 3]. On the other
hand, the response of the system, deﬁned here as the
diﬀerence of CheY-P concentrations between its extreme
value after the stimulus and its original value before the
stimulus, directly depends on the diﬀerence of receptor
activity between ligand bound and ligand free receptors:
∆Pn ≡ Pnv − Pno. The higher these diﬀerences are, the
higher the response will be.
In order to have high re-
sponse, it is favorable to increase ∆Pn and to have lower
total activity. Indeed, if we simply increase the activity
diﬀerence between the ligand bound and vacant receptor,
such as those used in Fig. 7 c, the total ampliﬁcation can
be increased to: 2.2 × 1.7 = 3.74. Other changes, such as
reducing the system’s total activity, can enhance the gain
much more, as noted also in (Barkai, 2001). A detailed
study of the response of the system is outside the scope
of this paper and will be reported in another communi-
cation.

Overall, the current model is capable of explaining the
qualitative behaviors of the chemotaxis pathway related
to adaptation, in particular, the robustness of the sys-
tem’s ability to adapt nearly perfectly. Much work is
still needed to modify and enrich the model to under-
stand the high sensitivity and wide dynamic range of the
system (Sourjik, 2002). However, because adaptation
and response occur with very diﬀerent time scale and via
largely diﬀerent molecular processes, modiﬁcation of the
model in explaining the high response gain should not
change the perfect adaptation conditions signiﬁcantly.
Indeed, it is not hard to show that even with receptor
coupling added to the current model, the conditions we
identiﬁed in this paper are still needed for the system to
achieve perfect adaptation, the only change is that activ-
ity of each receptor now depends also on its neighbors’
activities (B. Mello and Y. Tu, manuscript in prepara-
tion). We believe that, as long as the basic structure of
the protein interaction network stays intact, the perfect
adaptation conditions identiﬁed here will be mostly valid.
These conditions not only oﬀer explanation for adapta-
tion accuracy and its robustness, furthermore, they serve
as constrains for constructing quantitative models in un-
derstanding other aspects of the bacterial chemotaxis.

Appendix

In this section, we describe the detailed derivation of
the perfect adaptation conditions listed in the section
“Conditions for perfect adaptation”.As described there,
the approach is to construct global equations using global
and composite variables that do not depend on the recep-
tor population in any one individual methylation state.
First, we concentrate on the methylation related equa-
tions. Eq. 7, Eq. 8 and summation of Eq. 9 over
n ∈ [0, 4] gives 3 global equations. For the steady state,
the methylation ﬂux between diﬀerent methylation states
should be zero:

(0 ≤ n ≤ 3).

Condition 4 can be used in factoring out the common n
dependent factor from kR
n in Jn, after which
Eq. 23 are summed over n ∈ [0, 3] to obtain a global
equation.

n+1 and kB

nλ = K R/(P4λ − Pnλ) and K B

Using condition 2, the Michaelis constants can be
expressed as K R
nλ =
K B/(Pnλ − P0λ), where K R and K B are constants. If
we further enforce condition 3, i.e., P4o = P4v ≡ P4 and
P0o = P0v ≡ P0, we can convert all the weighted sums
of the individual receptor concentrations into two com-
[T F ] ≡
posite receptor concentrations [T F ] and [T AF ].

n=0[T F
n ] is the total concentration of the free receptors;
[T AF ] ≡
n ] is the total concentration of the
P
active free receptors, where Pn ≡ (1 − Ln)Pnv + LnPno is
the population-weighted average activity for a receptor
with n methyl groups. Therefore, after applying condi-
tions 2, 3 and 4, the 4 methylation related global equa-
tions can be written as:

If K B

nλ is a constant (i.e., CheB-P binds equally to all
receptors), condition 2 is violated. However, it is not
hard to see that if the receptor population in the n = 0
methylation state, [T0], is small, we can still sum up the
methylation balance equations to form a global equation.
The same is true if K R

nλ is a constant and [T4] ≈ 0.

Next, we focus on the phosphorylation related equa-
tions. Besides its importance in producing the ﬁnal

output of the signal transduction pathway CheY-P, the
phosphorylation is also coupled back to the methyla-
tion process through concentration [BP F ]. By writing
kP
nλ ≡ kP Y Pnλ
nλ ≡ kP Pnλ and using condition 5: kP Y
and kP B
nλ ≡ kP BPnλ, the phosphorylation related global
equations can be written as:

[Y P ] =

[BP F ] =

kP Y [T P A]
kHY + kP Y [T P A]
kP B[T P A]
kHB + kP B[T P A]

If the CheA phosphate transfer rates are independent
of its ligand/methylation status, i.e., kP Y
nλ ≡ kP Y and
nλ ≡ kP B, condition 5 is broken. A new composite
kP B
variable [T P ] ≡
n ] appears in the above equa-
tions, replacing [T P A] in Eq. 28, Eq. 29 and part of
Eq. 30. However, if [T P A] ≪ [T A], e.g., due to eﬃ-
cient phosphate transfer from CheA to CheY, [T P A] can
be neglected, and there again will be only two composite
variables in the phosphorylation related global equations,
and therefore the system may still adapt near perfectly
in absence of condition 5, as discussed in the section “Vi-
olating condition 5”.

The methylation and the phosphorylation global equa-
tions communicate through various CheB concentrations.
An extra equation is necessary to connect the concentra-
tions of these diﬀerent forms of the same proteins:

[BT ] = [BP ] + [BF ] − [BP F ].

(31)

Finally, by using Eq. 9, we can write down the expres-
sion for the total receptor activity of the system [T A] that
appears in Eq. 30:

[T A] =

The above equation contains a new composite variable
ξ′ =
n ]. Condition 6 is thus required to elim-
inate this extra term. Part of ξ′ can be expressed in terms
of the other composite variables, such as [T F ] and [T AF ].
Therefore, the eﬀect of violating condition 6 can not be

P

simply measured by the value of ξ′, as we discussed in
the section “Violating condition 6”.

If all the conditions listed in Conditions for perfect
adaptation are satisﬁed, we have nine global equations:
Eqs. 24-32, these 9 global equations contains 5 global
[RF ], [BP ], [BP F ], [BF ], [Y P ], and 4 com-
variables:
[T F ], [T AF ], [T A], [T P A]. Therefore,
posite variables:
the steady state values of all the nine global or compos-
ite variables, including [Y P ], will be independent of the
ligand concentration and the system can achieve perfect
adaptation.

Abstract

The codons, sixtyfour in number, are distributed over the coding parts of DNA sequences.

The distribution function is the plot of frequency-versus-rank of the codons. These distribu-

tions are characterised by parameters that are almost universal, i.e., gene independent. There

is but a small part that depends on the gene. We present the theory to calculate the universal

(gene-independent) part. The part that is gene-speciﬁc, however, has undetermined overlaps

and ﬂuctuations.

1 Introduction

The methods of statistical linguistics are used in recent years to study DNA sequences[1]. The genome

projects generate large volumes of data on DNA. Fast and reliable computational tools to analyse

this huge data of billlions of bases are required. The idea is to identify features in the sequences and

to correlate them with known biological functions. The methods of statistical linguistics[2] could

provide reliable computational algorithms. This is what we investigate here.

The sequences are made of the nucleotide bases A, C, G and T. The arrangement of the bases over

the linear chain determines all the information there is in DNA. The regions that code for proteins,

the coding regions (or the exons), have bases working in groups of three to make proteins. These

triplets are called codons. The biologically meaningful words are these codons. The noncoding parts

consist of the introns and the ﬂanks. These are presumed important in regulatory and promotional

activities. The biologically meaningful word structures in these regions are not known. A gene

generally comprises of a number of exon regions separated by introns. Since the biological functions

thus far are associated with the triplet codons, we concern ourselves only with these triplet words, the

codons. Therefore, in our analysis, instead of an entire gene, we consider the coding DNA sequence

(CDS) region of the gene, where the exon segments are put together, splicing the introns out.

Natural languages are characterised by structures determined by rules of grammar. The words

put together with these rules carry sense. The rules give coherence and meaning to long texts. The

3

languages have this long-range order. The frequency spectra show the presence of the long periods.

These are identiﬁed by the 1

f β type behaviour in the low frequency region[3]. Words placed at random

will have quite diﬀerent frequency spectrum with no long-range behavior. The early work on natural

languages dealing with the statistical distributions of words, done by Zipf [4], assigned ranks to the

words. The word most frequent has rank=1; the next most has rank=2 and so on. Zipf showed that

for natural languages the plot of frequency, fn, versus rank, n, is of the power-law form:

fn =

f1
nα

(1)

where f1 is the frequency of rank 1. In the Zipf’s original analysis the power-index α was assumed

to be one. Subsequent studies have allowed for deviations from one.

The DNA sequence of the letters A, C, G and T does have 1

f β frequency spectrum[5]. It is possible,

therefore, that the sequences have long-range order and underlying grammer rules. The opinion on

this issue remains divided[6]. Some have taken the view that DNA is language-like[7]. In the coding

regions the long periods have lower incidence than in the non-coding parts. The Zipf-type ﬁts in

DNA regions (with overlapping n-tuples) have shown that the index α is higher in the non-coding

segments over the coding ones. The averaged α over several overlapping n-tuples is nearer to the

value for natural languages for non-coding segments than the coding ones[1,7].

The body of evidence presented in support of the language-like features of DNA has remained

ambiguous[8]. For one it is not known how the power-law Zipf-behaviour of natural languages is

4

connected to the long-range correlations[9]. It is known, for instance, that pseudorandom sequences

satisfy Zipf- behaviour. Further, it is known that the frequencies of A, C, G and T vary somewhat

more for the introns and the ﬂanks over the exons[10]. The “long-range” order that is observed for

these noncoding regions may be an outcome of the frequency diﬀerences. The higher value of the

Zipf index for the noncoding segments may again be ascribed to these diﬀerences in the frequencies

of the bases.

The importance of statistical linguistics as a computational tool remains insuﬃciently explored for

DNA sequences. While the Zipf law is probably not connected to the deeper features of languages

such as the universal grammar, the coherence and the long periods, it could still be useful. For

instance, the index α of languages could be (and is) used in computer algorithms to identify authors.

The texts generated by authors vary slightly in their Zipf index. The index, therefore, identiﬁes the

author. Could one use similar algorithms to identify regions from the genome segments and relate

them to their biological functions?

As precision and reliability are important we have weighed the merits of power-law ﬁts over

exponential ﬁts. Since we are solely concerned with non-overlapping 3-tuples (i.e. the codons), we

ﬁnd the exponential ﬁts have consistently lower χ2. [Chi-square (χ2) is the sum of the ratio of the

squared diﬀerence between observed value at the ith point (oi) and the expected value at the ith point

(ei) to the expected value at the ith point (ei), i.e., χ2 = Pi

; where the sum i runs over the

(oi−ei)2
ei

number of points of the ﬁt. The value of χ2 depends on the total number of points to be ﬁt minus one,

5

sometimes called the degree of freedom, df.] The exponentials, therefore, provide better ﬁts. That

the power-law ﬁts for DNA sequences are worse than the exponentials have also been observed by

others[11]. The power law of Zipf is characterised by two parameters, the index α and the frequency

of rank one, i.e. f1. The number of parameters for the exponential ﬁt is of interest to us. The Zipf’s

law is used to ﬁnd the relationship connecting vocabulary to the text-length. Such connection does

exist for the exponential ﬁt as well.

The parameters of the exponential rank-frequency relation depend crucially on the text-length.

Once this parameter is known, the approximate length of the segment gets known as well. Indeed,

the exponential ﬁts are largely determined by two quantities, the frequency of rank 1, i.e., f1 and the

text-length of the sequence. There is however a small part that is characteristic of the gene. This

signature of the gene is potentially useful in generating algorithms to identify the gene and relate to

the biological functions.

2 The Approach

Out of the four bases A, C, G & T we have 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 possible triplets. Three combinations,

namely, TAA, TAG & TGA are the stop condons. Thus 64 - 3=61 is the meaningful vocabulary.

The codon most frequent has rank n=1, the next most has n=2 and so on. We deﬁne frequency,

f , of a particular codon as the number of times it appears in the sequence.

[Note this deﬁnition is

6

diﬀerent from some of the references where fn= N umber of words of rank n

T otal number of words

. The frequency of rank n is fn.

Here both frequency(f ) and rank(n) are dimensionless.

Observations on the CDS reveal that many codons may have the same frequency. Note that the

CDS we are dealing with are relatively short sequences of several hundred to several thousand bases.

This problem of multiple codons having the same frequency is called frequency degeneracy.

First, as we consider only codons, 61 in number, the problem of saturation of vocabulary for

large text-length is clear. However, for most genes we observe that the actual usage of codons is

smaller than 61. The codon usage is sometimes referred to as the vocabulary, i.e. the total number

of diﬀerent codons, used in the CDS.

From the Zipf’s law [equation(1)] with α=1 we have

ln(fn) = ln(f1) − ln(n)

If we plot ln(fn) vs ln(n) we have a straight line with slope -1 and intercept on the y-axis at ln(f1).

Clearly, the maximum rank is just equal to f1. When α deviates from 1, f1 and the maximum rank

are connected to each other through α. The maximum rank (i.e. the vocabulary) along with f1 (or

α) determine the text-length l, i.e., the total number of triplets, as follows :

l = f1 + f2 + f1 + f3 + .... + fn

= f1(1 +

1
2α +

1
3α + .... +

1
nα )

7

Thus, α may be thought of as a function of f1 and the text-length l. We want to arrive at the

corresponding relation for our exponential ﬁts.

3 The Exponential Fit

All the degenerate frequencies are assigned diﬀerent rank number. Thus if CCG and CAG have the

same frequency of occurrence they belong to two diﬀerent ranks (one following the other) in our

work. Therefore, here too, the codon usage, maximum rank and vocabulary are synonymous. The

exponential function that connects frequency to rank is

fn = f1exp{−β(n − 1)}

(2)

where β, a dimensionless constant for a particular gene, is to be determined from the ﬁt.

We have tried this ﬁt function on over 300 CDS. The CDS are sourced from the EMBL[12] and

the GenBank[13] data bases. Table 1 gives the values of β for some of the sequences under study.

The plots showing the ﬁt is ﬁgure(1).

The index β in the exponential of equation(2) takes diﬀerent values for the genes. It turns out,

however, that β is not completely a free parameter. Indeed, from Table 1, we notice that CDS that

have text-lengths and also f1 that are close have similar, though not identical, β values. Notice, for

instance, the β-globin CDS from the chicken and the clawed frog have the same l and f1, 147 and

9 respectively; whereas the lysozyme CDS from the ﬁsh, Cyprinus carpio has 146 as l and 9 as f1.

8

The β values for the β-globin CDS of the chicken and the frog are 0.05773 and 0.05772; while the

lysozyme CDS, though functionally quite unrelated to the β-globin, has the β value of 0.06056. So

the value of β is determined to a considerable extent by f1 and the text-length of the sequence, l.

There is but a part in β that is characteristic of the gene.

4 Plot of β vs. f1

Figure(2) gives plots of β vs f1 for four complete CDS coding for α-globin, β-globin, phosphoglycerate

kinase and globulin proteins. The χ2 values indicate that the relationship between β and f1 is linear

to a good approximation. The plot for each CDS involves data on the gene from diﬀerent species.

These are sourced from GenBank. Each of the linear plots are speciﬁc to the gene. The evolution

of the genes, as we move higher in the evolutionary hierarchy, does not signiﬁcantly alter the overall

text-length of the CDS regions.

The slope of the globin CDS, the α and the β, are nearly equal. As we show in the subsequent

pages the value of β is considerably determined by f1 and l. There is but a small part that is unique

to the gene. For the case of the α and the β globins notice that the text-lengths of these CDS vary

in a small range between 143 and 147. Table 1 shows that any two quite unrelated CDS can have β

values that are close provided their text-lengths and the f1 are nearly equal.

The plots in ﬁgure(3) of β vs f1 keep the text-length l ﬁxed at 140 for the same four genes.

9

Though the closeness in the values of the slope indeed show the inﬂuence of l on the β value, the

small diﬀerences indicate the presence of the l-independent part in the β value.

That the β values are not completely determined by f1 and l, but do have a component, albeit

small, coming from the genes is illustrated in our next plot, ﬁgure(4). A number of diﬀerent CDS,

each from a diﬀerent organism, were chosen and cut at three diﬀerent text-lengths 30, 140 and 300,

i.e., we considered only the ﬁrst 30, 140 and 300 triplets respectively out of the whole CDS. The

plot of β vs f1 for these three diﬀerent text-lengths indicates that when the text-length is held ﬁxed,

but the genes are varied, the exponential gives a better ﬁt over the linear. It is noteworthy that

even though the genes are unrelated in as far as their biological functions are concerned, the codon

distributions, described by the experimental ﬁt of ﬁgure(4), are not completely unrelated.

Taken together, the two plots, ﬁgure(3) and ﬁgure(4), tell us:

(i) When the text-length, l, is held ﬁxed, and the genes are not varied, the plot of β vs f1 is linear

and

(ii) When the text-length, l, is held ﬁxed, and the genes are varied, the plot of β vs f1 is exponential.

Thus, we conclude that the value of β does have a part that is gene speciﬁc.

10

5 Plot of β vs l

β, as we have observed from Table 1, depends on f1 and l. Beyond that there is the part that is gene

speciﬁc. In other words the parameters of the functional ﬁt do depend, in a small way, on the gene.

This dependence we discuss later. Here, in this section, we concern ourselves with the dependence

of β on the text-length of the CDS.

We plot β vs l keeping f1 ﬁxed. The plots in ﬁgure(5) show the dependence for four diﬀerent

values of f1, namely f1=7, f1=9, f1=20, and f1=38.

In plotting ﬁgure(5) we considered the f1 values of the natural CDS. We had the option to cut

the CDS into fragments to suit our value of f1. This procedure turned out to be arbitrary as the

f1 value may remain ﬁxed over some hundred bases. Cutting into fragments is nonunique. It was,

therefore, diﬃcult to restrict our study of β vs l for a particular gene. For a speciﬁc CDS (from

diﬀerent species) the text-length does not vary signiﬁcantly in most cases. Therefore for a ﬁxed

value of f1 the CDS were searched over diﬀerent genes. Thus f1 is held ﬁxed, but genes vary.

Though more data for each gene could have improved the result, nevertheless the relationship

between β and l for ﬁxed f1 has a linear trend. As the text-length increases β decreases. However,

the plots for diﬀerent values of f1 are not parallel. They depend on f1. The slope reaches a maximum

at around f1 = 10 and tend to decrease as we go away from f1=10 on either side. For large values

of f1, the slopes tend to become parallel.

11

6 Theory of β

f1 shows that ∆β

∆f1 is positive.

We have seen β depends on the text-length, l, and the frequency of rank 1, f1.

(1) When the text-length l is held ﬁxed, genes not varied, β depends linearly on f1. The plot of β vs

(2) When the text-length is kept ﬁxed, but the genes are varied, the plot of β vs f1 show deviations

from linearity. An exponential ﬁt appears more appropriate.

(3) When f1 is held ﬁxed (genes are varied as well) the plot of β vs l shows an approximate linear

behaviour. ∆β

∆l is negative. Note that, because of the points mentioned earlier, the variations in l (in

ﬁgure 5) are over a rather small range. As a result the full l-dependence is not clear from ﬁgure(5).

In this section we investigate β theoretically. Let us denote the maximum rank by nmax. Since

the frequency of nmax is almost always one, we get

Or,

The text-length l is just the sum over all the frequencies. Thus,

Since, the quantity f1

is small compared to one, we get, to the ﬁrst approximation

Equation(9) tells us

(i) β vs f1, when l is kept ﬁxed, is linear; the slope is positive.

(ii) β vs l, with f1 ﬁxed, is hyperbolic. If the text-length variation is small we expect an approximate

linear relation with negative slope (as observed in ﬁgure(5)). How good the relation(9) is checked in

While the relation(9) tells us that β is entirely determined by the ratio of f 1-1 to l, ﬁgure(3)

tells us that this quantity does have a characteristic dependence on the gene family. We conclude,

therefore, that the relation(9) does not determine β entirely. There is a part that is gene speciﬁc.

The theoretical values of β, equation(9), is reasonably close to the values obtained from the CDS.

The dependence of β on f 1 and l of equation(9) is gene-independent. It is the universal part of β.

The deviation from this universal part, even though small, is established in ﬁgure(3) and ﬁgure(4).

13

We deﬁne the quantity β

that gives a measure of this deviation through the relation:

where βT h = [ f1−1

].

We have retained the ﬁrst two orders in f1
l

[ of equation(8)]. This is to make sure the higher-orders

in f1

l do not account for the deviations. The values of β′ appear in the last columm of Table 1.

7 β, β′

and Evolution

We get back to Table 1 for the CDS of α-globin, β-globin, insulin and globulin. We notice the

value of f1 increases as we walk up along the ladder of evolution. The increase in f1 increases β

while the text-length of the CDS does not change signiﬁcantly in evolution. The results for insulin

and the globulin CDS [Table 1] carry at least one exception. Interestingly, for both these CDS, the

exceptional species is the same, the rabbit. The rabbit has f1 and β values greater than the human

for these two CDS. The number of exceptions increase for the two globins. Some ﬁshes show greater

f1 (and hence β) values than the amphibian species, the African clawed frog. If we average β for the

mammals we ﬁnd it always exceeds the other groups.

On the other hand, if we compare the β

values for each of these four CDS, α-globin and globulin

′

do not show any clear pattern. In insulin, the β

values increase as we move from ﬁsh to mammals

′

14

through amphibia. But the syrian hamster CDS is found to have lower β

than the clawed frog CDS.

′

Besides the rat has greater β

compared to the human. In β-globin, the Atlantic salmon ﬁsh stands

as an exception. Otherwise, the β

value increases from amphibia, bird to mammals. But here the

representatives of amphibia and bird have the same value, and the lemur exceeds the value of human.

We conclude that the value of β

, though independent of l and f1, is less species speciﬁc; whereas the

′

′

′

value of β does have evolutionary content.

8 Gene-Speciﬁc Signatures

In ﬁgure(2) we showed that β vs f1 is a straight line when the genes are not varied. When the genes

are varied, but the text-length is held constant, the relationship of β to f1 is no longer linear. The

exponential ﬁt is appropriate for this case. This led us to conclude that there is a part to β that is

gene-speciﬁc.

In ﬁgure(3) we plotted β vs f1 keeping the genes ﬁxed for diﬀerent organisms. The slope ∆β

∆f1 is

a characteristic of the gene. There is a variation in the slope as we go from one gene to another.

The regular, namely exponential form, obtained in ﬁgure(4) in the plot of β vs f1, l being kept

constant, tells us that the variations of β, as we go from one gene to another, is orderly.

β has a part that is gene independent. We isolate this universal component of β theoretically.

This part comes out to be a function of the text-length of the sequence and the frequency of rank 1,

15

i.e. f1. The quantity β

, deﬁned in equation(10), measures the deviation of the actual β from this

′

universal, gene-independent, contribution given in equation(10). If the gene speciﬁc features are not

dominant, β

should be close to one. Table 1 gives us the values of β

. Clearly, the gene speciﬁc

′

′

components in β could be as high as 40% (as in insulin). We are led to conclude that the methods of

statistical linguistics, of the Zipf variety, has the potential in algorithms to identify genes from the

databases.

′

′

The quantity β

that isolates the gene-speciﬁc components of β is however not unique to genes.

Observations on β

(Table 1) show that the range of variations in β

do overlap for diﬀerent genes.

There continues to be undetermined ﬂuctuations in the values of β

. Work is currently in progress

′

′

to isolate the unique gene-identifying signatures in the Zipf-approach.

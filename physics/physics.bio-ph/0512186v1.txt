Abstract

It is shown that the presence of mixed-culture growth in batch fermentation pro-
cesses can be very accurately inferred from total biomass data by means of the
wavelet analysis for singularity detection. This is accomplished by considering sim-
ple phenomenological models for the mixed growth. The main quantity provided by
the wavelet analysis is the H¨older exponent of the singularity that we determine for
our illustrative examples. The numerical results point to the possibility that H¨older
exponents can be employed to characterize the nature of the mixed-culture growth
in batch fermentation processes with potential industrial applications.

1 Introduction

The growth of microbial species in media containing two or several growth-
limiting substrates is of great importance in biotechnology and bioengineering.
The mixed-culture growth occurs in many industrial processes. A ﬁrst signiﬁ-
cant class of such processes is the traditional fermented foods and beverages in
which either endemic microorganisms or an inoculum with selected microor-
ganisms are used, see for instance Szambelan et al. (2004). Some beverages
get two or more diﬀerent microorganisms in the inoculum with the purpose

to provide a desired ﬂavor. Evidence of this inﬂuence are presented in the
recent paper of Fleet et al. (2004), in which the role of diﬀerent yeast inter-
actions on the wine ﬂavor is discussed. However, the phenomenological details
and the theory of the time evolution of the fermentation are as yet poorly
understood. We can also mention the interesting case of the bioethanol pro-
duction, in which the substrates used for fermentation typically consist of a
mixture of glucose and fructose. Bioethanol is the product obtained from the
metabolism of microbe mixtures feeding with this combination of hexoses and
pentoses, see e.g., de Souza Liberal et al. (2005). The last relevant example
we give is bioremediation, in which gasoline and chemical spills generally yield
a complex mixture of water-soluble organic compounds. In gasoline spills, for
instance, the four basic compounds are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and
xylene. The consumption of this mixture by microorganisms is what is deﬁned
as the bioremediation process.

In all the aforementioned cases, the presence of diﬀerent populations of mi-
croorganisms and substrates is a key factor in the quality and quantity of the
ﬁnal product. Therefore, it is quite useful to detect the presence or lacking
of process of mixed-culture growth type. Their presence could be used as an
estimate of the right evolution of the process in its early stage. In addition, a
rapid and reasonably accurate test is always useful for saving time and helping
to take quick decisions. It is quite clear then that the biomass concentration
is one of the most needed quantity that should be measured in fermentation
monitoring. The most popular method to get the biomass concentration is by
means of the measurement of the optical density of centrifugalized samples.
However, this procedure has limited usefulness because it cannot distinguish
neither the living cells from the dead ones, nor the diﬀerent types of microor-
ganisms involved in the process. In some cases it is also possible to correlate
the total biomass concentration with the values of the redox potential of the
fermentation.

Recently, new techniques have emerged to quantify the biomass and dis-
tinguish the diﬀerent microorganisms present in a mixed-culture. Some of
then based on sophisticated equipment (Callister et al. (2003), Madrid et al.
(2005) and Pons et al. (1993)) and others resides on molecular biology tech-
niques (de Souza Liberal et al. (2005) and Granchi et al. (1999)). All these
techniques are very promising in the study of the dynamics of the mixed-
culture growth, although, they require expensive or complicated procedures.
In this paper, we show that it is possible to infer mixed-culture growth of mi-
croorganisms from their total biomass data, without using such complicated
techniques. The alternative procedure that we put forth here is based on treat-
ing the total biomass data by means of the wavelet approach for detection of
singularities in the growth curves. The idea is to treat the mixed growth curves
as more or less regular signals that can nevertheless display singularities due
to their compound structure. In the wavelet literature there exist fundamen-

2

tal papers in which it has been shown that the wavelet techniques are very
eﬃcient in detecting any type of singularities.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a simple
dynamics of the mixed-growth type and discuss its basic assumptions. Next, in
Section 3, the method of the wavelet singularity analysis is brieﬂy presented,
whereas its application to the mixed type dynamical curves is enclosed in
Section 4. A conclusion section ends up the paper. An appendix containing
the standard deﬁnitions of H¨older exponents of singularities of functions is
included as well.

2 A simple mixed-growth model

The technology of batch processes is well developed and numerous products
are obtained in this way. Some products, such as food, beverages, and pharma-
ceutical ones require precise tracking of the batch information for safety and
regulatory purposes. The primary objective of monitoring batch processes is
to ensure that signiﬁcant and sustained changes in the quality of the prod-
uct (caused by disturbances and/or faults) are detected as soon as possible.
In that sense, the rapid detection of singularities in the output of the batch
processes oﬀers an interesting solution. The wavelet analysis for singularity
detection is by now well established but there was no direct application to
infer mixed-growth in the case of batch biochemical processes.

In order to achieve this task we will consider here a fermentation process con-
sisting of a perfectly stirred tank, where no streams are fed into it. In the batch
fermenter the substrate is converted by biomass into additional biomass and
products. The general unstructured mass balances for the well-mixed biore-
actor can be represented by the following equations for the concentrations of
the cells and substrates:

d x1,i
dt
d x2,i
dt

= x1,i µ (x2,i)

=

x1,i
Yi

−

µ (x2,i)

where x1,i represent the biomass concentrations, x2,i substrate concentrations
R repre-
and Yi is the biomass yield, µ (x2,i) is the speciﬁc growth rate and i
sent the ith species, allowing for the possibility of multiple kinds of substrates
and microorganisms. The growth rate relates the change in biomass concen-
trations to the substrate concentrations. Two types of relationships for µ (x2,i)
are commonly used: the substrate saturation model (Monod Equation) and

∈

3

the substrate inhibition model (Haldane Equation). Both cases will be treated
here. The substrate inhibited growth can be described by

µ (x2,i) =

µmax x2,i
K1i + x2,i + K2i

where K1i is the saturation (or Monod) constant, K2 is the inhibition constant
and µmaxi is the maximum speciﬁc growth rate. The value of K1i expresses the
aﬃnity of the biomass for the substrate. The Monod growth kinetics can be
considered as a special case of the substrate inhibition kinetics with K2i = 0
when the inhibition term vanishes. For the sake of simplicity, we will consider
only two species and two substrates. Moreover, we consider that it is possible
to measure only the total biomass concentration. That means that the output
of the system (y) will be given by

y =

x1,i

m

Xi=1

where m is the number of species of microorganisms growing in the bioreactor
(in this work m = 2). We focus on the following four cases:

I The microorganism and substrate concentrations have the same initial con-
ditions, but diﬀerent growth rates, one with a Haldane type and one with a
Monod type. In addition, quite diﬀerent values of the Monod constant will
be taken into account.

II The microorganism and substrate concentrations have diﬀerent initial con-

ditions, but the same growth rates.

III The microorganism and substrate concentrations have diﬀerent initial con-
ditions and diﬀerent growth rates, one with a Haldane type and one with a
Monod type.

IV The microorganism and substrate concentrations have the same initial con-
ditions and the same growth rates, but with diﬀerent values of the maximal
growth rate.

Table 1 shows the variables and parameter values used to simulated the two
species growing in the two diﬀerent substrates, under the four cases under
consideration.

3 Measuring regularity with the wavelet transform

Let us think of the total biomass of the mixed-growth curves as a signal. In
general, performing the analysis of a signal means to ﬁnd the regions of its
regular and singular behavior. Usually the singularities are very speciﬁc fea-
tures for signal characterization. As it has been pointed in the seminal paper
of Mallat (1999), the regularity of a signal treated as a function can be char-
acterized by H¨older exponents. The wavelet transform has been demonstrated
to be a tool exceptionally well suited for the estimation of H¨older exponents
(for their deﬁnitions see the Appendix).

3.1 The wavelet transform

Let L2(R) denote the space of all square integrable functions on R. In signal
processing terminology, L2(R) is the space of functions with ﬁnite energy. Let
L2(R) be a ﬁxed function. The function ψ(t) is said to be a wavelet if
ψ(t)
and only if its Fourier transform, ˆψ(ω) =

eiωtψ(t)dt, satisﬁes

The non-divergent relation given by Eq. (1) is called the admissibility condition
in wavelet theory, see for instance Daubechies (1992) and Mallat (1999). It
implies that the wavelet must have a zero average on the real line

and therefore it must be oscillatory. In other words, ψ must be a sort of
wave (Daubechies
(1999)). Based on ψ(t), one deﬁnes the
functions ψa,b as follows

(1992); Mallat

∈

R+ (a

R is a translation parameter, while a

where b
= 0) is a dilation or
scale parameter. The factor a−1/2 is a normalization constant such that ψa,b
has the same energy for all scales a. One notices that the scale parameter a in
Eq. (3) is a measures of the dilations of the spatial variable (t
b). In the same
way, the factor a−1/2 measures the dilations of the values taken by ψ. Because
of this, one can decompose a square integrable function f (t) in terms of the
dilated-translated wavelets ψa,b(t). We deﬁne the wavelet transform (WT) of
f (t)

L2(R) by

where
and the bar symbol denotes complex conjugation. The WT given by Eq. (4)
measures the variation of f in a neighborhood of size proportional to a centered
on point b. In order, to reconstruct f from its wavelet transform (4), one needs
a reconstruction formula, known as the resolution of the identity (Daubechies
(1992); Mallat (1999)).

From the above equation we can see why the condition given by Eq. 1 should
be imposed. One fundamental property that we require in order to analyze
singular behavior is that ψ(t) has enough vanishing moments as argued in the
works of Muzy et al. (1994) and Mallat and Hwang (1992). A wavelet is said
to have n vanishing moments if and only if it satisﬁes

and

This means that a wavelet with n vanishing moments is orthogonal to poly-
nomials up to order n
1. In fact, the admissibility condition given by Eq. (1)
requires at least one vanishing moment. So the wavelet transform of f (t) with
a wavelet ψ(t) with n vanishing moments is nothing but a “smoothed version”
of the nth derivative of f (t) on various scales. In fact, when someone is inter-
ested to measure the local regularity of a signal this concept is crucial (see for
intance Daubechies (1992); Mallat (1999)).

3.2 Wavelet singularity analysis

The local regularity of a function f at a point t0 is often measured by its H¨older
exponent. The H¨older exponent α measures the strength of a singularity at a
particular point t0, where t0 belongs to the domain of f , see the Appendix.
It is important to point out that if the singular part of a function f in the
α, then it corresponds to a cusp
neighborhood of t0 is of the type
−
and in this case the singular behavior is fully characterized by its H¨older
exponent. However, there exists functions that involve oscillating singularities
which have to be described by an additional quantity: an oscillating exponent
(Arneodo et al. (1996a,b)). In such a case, the oscillation have to be analyzed
carefully. Such functions can not be fully characterized only by the H¨older
exponent. In this work we will only consider functions whose singularities are
not oscillating.

One classical tool to measure the regularity of a function f (t) is to look at the
asymptotic decay of its Fourier transform ˆf (ω) at inﬁnity. However, the Fourier
transform is not well adapted to measure the local regularity of functions,
because it is global and provides a description of the overall regularity of

7

6
functions (Mallat and Hwang (1992); Mallat (1999)). Consequently, we need
another way to characterize local signal regularity.

In the works of Muzy et al. (1994); Daubechies (1992); Mallat and Hwang
(1999) it is shown that the WT provides a way of doing a
(1992); Mallat
precise analysis of the regularity properties of functions. This is made possible
by the scale parameter. Due to its ability to focus on singularities in the signals,
the WT is sometimes referred to as a ’mathematical microscope’ (Muzy et al.
(1994); Daubechies (1992); Mallat and Hwang (1992); Mallat (1999)), where
the used wavelet determines the optics of the microscope and its magniﬁcation
is given by the scale factor a.

The WT modulus maxima (Wtmm) decomposition introduced by Mallat and Hwang
(1992) provides a local analysis of the singular behavior of signals. Mallat and Hwang
(1992); Mallat (1999) have shown that for cusp singularities the location of
the singularity can be detected and the related exponent can be recovered from
the scaling of the WT along the so-called maxima line (henceforth Wtmml)
converging towards the singularity. This is the line where the WT reaches lo-
cal maximum with respect to the position coordinate. Connecting such local
maxima within the continuous WT ’landscape’ gives rise to the entire tree of
maxima lines. The collection of such maxima lines provides a particularly use-
ful representation of the entire WT. It incorporates the main characteristics
of the WT, its ability to reveal the hierarchy of (singular) features including
the scaling behavior as well.

In addition to the vanishing moments, another key concept used to character-
ize the regularity of a function in terms of Wtmm is the H¨older exponent that
C, C]. The
is brieﬂy explained next. Suppose that ψ has compact support [
cone of inﬂuence of ψ at point t0 is the set of points (a, b) in the scale-space
plane or domain, such that t0 is in the support of ψa,b(t). We will denote the
scale–space plane or domain of the WT as the (a, b)-plane or the (a, b)-domain.

The function f (t) has a H¨older exponent α
(k, k + 1) at t0, if and only if
there exists a constant A > 0 such that at each modulus maxima (a, b) in the
cone deﬁned by Eq. (8) one has

(see Mallat and Hwang (1992); Mallat (1999)). Here it is assumed that the
wavelet has at least n > α vanishing moments. If f (t) is regular at t0 or, if the

4 Results and discussion

In this section, we present the results we obtained using the singularity detec-
tion procedure described in the previous section. The signal to be analyzed,
f (t) = y, represents the evolution in time of the total biomass concentration
for the fermentation process described in Section 2 that includes four diﬀerent
cases as speciﬁed therein. In all the wavelet-related calculations we employed
as mother wavelet the ﬁrst derivative Gaussian ψ′(t) = d/dt(e−t2/2) having
only one vanishing moment. The ﬁnal goal is always to calculate the H¨older
exponent of the singularities for such processes because it is a direct measure
of the irregularity of a signal (function) at the singular point t0, in the sense
that higher values of it correspond to more regular functions than the lower
values.

Figure 1 a,b,c shows the performance of the wavelet singularity analysis as
applied to Case I (same initial conditions but diﬀerent kinetic rates). We
obtain a H¨older exponent of quite high value, α = 0.95, indicating a rather
regular mixed-growth function.

cycle, c) From the slope in the double logarithmic plot, the H¨older coeﬃcient of the

Similarly to the previous cases, Fig. (3) presents the graphical results for
Case III (diﬀerent initial conditions and diﬀerent growth rates). Although,
the singularity looks very mild in the time evolution of the total biomass

Finally, case IV (same initial conditions, same growth rates but with diﬀerent
values of their maximal growth rates) is graphically analyzed in Fig. (4). For
this case we obtained the lowest H¨older exponent.

Although the latter two cases seem to correspond to almost overlapping of the
WTMML pointing to bifurcation phenomena we are still not at the threshold
of a completely diﬀerent behavior of the log plots generated by bifurcations.
This could be explained by the fact that the strength of the ﬁrst singularity
is bigger with respect to the second one.

5 Concluding Remarks

We showed here explicitly how the wavelet singularity analysis can be applied
to infer mixed growth behavior of fermentation processes using only total
biomass data. We prove that the wavelet analysis is very accurate for all the
cases we considered. A very interesting feature of our research is that the
H¨older exponent is sensitive to the type of the mixed-growth phenomenon,
more speciﬁcally depends on the parameters of the growth processes and on
their initial conditions. We hope that in future works we could ﬁnd out the
mathematical relationships implied by this possible correlation. It might allow
the usage of the H¨older exponent as an identiﬁcation criterium of the more

13

speciﬁc nature of mixed-growth processes.

The space of H¨older continuous functions is denoted C α. A function is said
to be C n+α if it is in C n and its nth derivative is H¨older continuous with
exponent α. Thus, if we consider the H¨older exponent n < α < n + 1, with
N, the function can be diﬀerentiated n times, but the (n + 1)th derivative
n
does not exist. Therefore, a function with a H¨older exponent n < α < n + 1 is
said to be singular in the nth derivative. Keeping this in mind, let us give the
following deﬁnition of the H¨older regularity of a function Daubechies (1992);
Mallat and Hwang (1992); Mallat (1999).

The function f (t) has a global H¨older exponent α on the interval (c, d) if
and only if there is a constant K and a polynomial of order n, Pn(t), such
that equation (13) is satisﬁed for all t

(c, d).

The H¨older regularity of f (t) at t0 is the supremum of α such that f (t) is
H¨older α at t0.
The nth derivative of a function f (t) is singular at t0 if f (t) has a local
H¨older exponent α at t0 with n < α < n + 1.

A function f (t) that is continuously diﬀerentiable at a given point has a H¨older
(n, n + 1) in (13) then f (t) is n
exponent not less than 1 at this point. If α
times but not (n + 1) times diﬀerentiable at the point t0, and the polynomial
Pn(t) corresponds to the ﬁrst (n + 1) terms of the Taylor series of f (t) around
t = t0. For example, if n = 0, we have P0(t

t0) = f (t0).

In this paper, a new method to eﬃciently simulate diﬀusion controlled second order chemical
reactions is derived and applied to site-speciﬁc DNA-binding proteins. The protein enters a spherical
cell and propagates via two competing modes, a free diﬀusion and a DNA-sliding mode, to search for
its speciﬁc binding site in the center of the cell. There is no need for a straight forward simulation
of this process. Instead, an alternative and exact approach is shown to be essentially faster than
explicit random-walk simulations. The speed-up of this novel simulation technique is rapidly growing
with system size.

INTRODUCTION

Diﬀusion controlled bio-chemical reactions play a cen-
tral role in keeping any organism alive [1, 2]: The trans-
port of molecules through cell membranes, the passage
of ions across the synaptic gap, or the search carried out
by drugs on the way to their protein receptors are pre-
dominantly diﬀusive processes. Further more, essentially
all of the biological functions of DNA are performed by
proteins that interact with speciﬁc DNA sequences [3, 4],
and these reactions are diﬀusion-controlled.

However, it has been realized that some proteins are
able to ﬁnd their speciﬁc binding sites on DNA much
more rapidly than is ‘allowed’ by the diﬀusion limit [1, 5].
It is therefore generally accepted that some kind of facil-
itated diﬀusion must take place in these cases. Several
mechanisms, diﬀering in details, have been proposed. All
of them essentially involve two steps: the binding to a
random non-speciﬁc DNA site and the diﬀusion (sliding)
along the DNA chain. These two steps may be reiter-
ated many times before proteins actually ﬁnd their tar-
get, since the sliding is occasionally interrupted by dis-
sociation. Berg [5] and Zhou [6] have provided thorough
(but somewhat sophisticated) theories that allow esti-
mates for the resulting reaction rates. Recently, Halford
has presented a comprehensive review on this subject and
proposed a remarkably simple and semiquantitative ap-
proach that explicitly contains the mean sliding length
as a parameter of the theory [7]. This approach has been
reﬁned and put onto a rigorous base in a recent work by
the authors [8].

Although analytical models provide a good general un-
derstanding of the problem, they fail to give quantitative
predictions for systems of realistic complexity. There-
fore, numerical simulations are required to calibrate the
set of parameters that form the backbone of these mod-

els. However, a straight forward simulation of a protein
searching through mega-bases of non-target DNA to ﬁnd
its speciﬁc binding site would be prohibitive for all ex-
cept for the most simple numerical models. Fortunately,
there are better ways. Two of the authors (KK and JL)
have recently introduced the method of excess collisions
(MEC) for an eﬃcient simulation of intramolecular reac-
tions in polymers [9]. In the present work, this method
is modiﬁed to apply to second order diﬀusion controlled
chemical reactions (Section 2.1). We thereby construct a
simple random walk approach to facilitated diﬀusion of
DNA-binding proteins (Section 2.2) and apply the MEC
and our analytical estimate for reaction times to this
model (Section 2.3 and 2.4). Section 3 provides details
about the generation of DNA-chains, followed by a set of
simulations covering a large range of system dimensions
(Section 5) to verify the performance of the MEC.

2. THEORY

2.1. Method of excess collisions (MEC)

We consider a (time-homogeneous) stochastic process.
The problem is to ﬁnd the average time τBA of the ﬁrst
arrival at a certain state A, provided that, at time t = 0,
the system occupied another state B.

Suppose we observe the system for a long time inter-
val T and monitor the events of entering state A. These
events will be referred to as collisions. Each collision
that occurs for the ﬁrst time after visiting state B will
be called prime collision. We obtain the (asymptotically
correct for T → ∞) relation

T = n(T ) τR = n

(T ) τ

′

′
R ,

(1)

where n(T ) and n′(T ) are the average numbers of all
and of prime collisions during the time interval T , re-
spectively, and τR and τ ′
R are the corresponding mean

recurrence times. Hence,

′
τ
R =

n(T )
n′(T )

τR ≡ N τR .

(2)

The ratio N ≡ n(T )/n′(T ) deﬁnes the average number of
collisions between two visits to state B and does actually
not depend on T , once T is chosen suﬃciently large. The
mean recurrence time τ ′
R of prime collisions is simply the
average time the system requires to move from state A
to B and back from state B to A:

where τAB is the mean time of ﬁrst arrival at state B
starting from A. With eq. (2) we then obtain

′
τ
R = τAB + τBA ,

τBA = N τR − τAB .

This relation is useful for the numerical estimation of
τBA if τBA ≫ τAB. A simulation cycle then starts in state
A and ends as soon as state B is reached, i.e. the reversed
reaction A → B is simulated in order to obtain the (much
lower) reaction rate of the original reaction B → A. In
this case we can write

N = hNcolli + 1 ,

(5)

where hNcolli is the average number of collisions in a sim-
ulation cycle and the second term accounts for the prime
collision (which is not observed in the simulations, since
the cycle starts at the time instant that immediately fol-
lows the prime collision). As will be shown later in Sec-
tion 2.3, the recurrence time τR can be renormalized and
computed eﬃciently inside a small test system. Note that
eq. (4) can be written as

which are not included explicitly in the model, like pro-
tein orientation and conformation. An attractive step
potential is implemented as

U (d) =

d ≤ rc
d > rc ,

(3)

(4)

where d is the shortest distance between walker and
chain. This deﬁnes a pipe with radius rc around the
chain contour that the walker is allowed to enter freely
from outside, but to exit only with the probability

p = exp(−Eo/kBT ) ,

(9)

where kBT is the Boltzmann factor, otherwise it is re-
ﬂected back inside the chain. We may therefore denote p
as exit probability. It is important to note that p deﬁnes
the equilibrium constant K of the two phases, the free
and the non-speciﬁcally bound protein, according to

K ≡

where c is the concentration of free proteins and σ =
c Vc/(p L) is the linear density of proteins that are non-
speciﬁcally bound to the DNA, with Vc = π r2
c L being
the geometric volume of the chain.

2.3. Method of computation of the recurrence time

The two states of interest are the protein entering the
cell, B, and the same protein reaching the active site in
the center of the cell, A. More speciﬁcally, we are inter-
ested in ﬁnding the time τBA the walker requires to reach
a distance r = ra when starting at distance r(t = 0) = R.
We shall ﬁrst deﬁne the excluded volume of the chain

as

is the mean number of excess collisions per simulation
cycle [9], since the ratio τAB/τR is just the mean number
of collisions that would be observed in a simulation run
of length τAB with a starting point at an arbitrary state
of the system (not necessary state A).

2.2. Simple model for facilitated diﬀusion of
DNA-binding proteins

We consider a spherical volume (cell) of radius R and
inside it a worm-like chain (DNA) of length L and radius
rc. The protein is represented as a random walker mov-
ing inside the cell with a certain time step dt. A collision
takes place once the walker enters the active binding site,
a spherical volume of radius ra positioned in the middle
of the chain that, in its turn, coincides with the center

where U (d) is the energy of the walker as deﬁned by eq.

Next we assume that simulations were carried out within
a small test system of radius R∗ < R and that the re-
currence time τ ∗
R of the walker was found. Its recurrence
time in the larger system is then found as

τR(V ) = ˜τR Veﬀ ,

(13)

where we have deﬁned

˜τR ≡

τ ∗
R
V ∗

.

(14)

This ratio does not depend on system size and may there-
fore be called speciﬁc recurrence time. It only depends on
the potential-depth Eo and the step-size chosen for the
random walk. The idea is to compute ˜τR (as described
in Section 4) for a small test system with dimensions
of the order of ra (which is the radius of the speciﬁc
binding site) to obtain τR for the system of interest us-
ing eq. (13). Once τR is known, τAB is computed via
random walk simulations in the large system, starting at
r(t = 0) = ra and terminating as soon as the periphery of
the cell r(τAB) = R is reached. Following the trajectory
of the walker, the number of collisions hNcolli = N − 1 is
monitored as well, so that eq. (4) can be used to deter-
mine the much longer reaction time τBA.

2.4. Analytical estimate for the collision time

As has been discussed in detail elsewhere [8], it is possi-
ble to estimate the reaction time for the protein using an
analytical approach, once certain conditions are satisﬁed.
The resulting expression is

(16)

and D1d and D3d being the diﬀusion coeﬃcients in
sliding-mode and free diﬀusion, respectively. Generally,
the equilibrium constant K has to be determined in sim-
ulations of a (small) test system, containing a piece of
chain without speciﬁc binding site [8].
In the present
model, K is known analytically via eq. (10). If the step-
size dr of the random walker is equal both inside and
outside the chain (the direction of the step being arbi-
trary), we further have D1d = D3d = dr2/6, and hence
obtain

ξ =

2p

.

s

(17)

This variable has got the dimension of length; as we have
pointed out in [8], it corresponds to the average sliding
length of the protein along the DNA contour in Halford’s
model [7]. In this light, a (non rigorous) interpretation of
eq. (15) is as follows: The ﬁrst term in the round brackets
represents the time of free diﬀusion of the walker, whereas
the second term stands for the time of one-dimensional
sliding. With increasing aﬃnity of the walker to the chain
(expressed as a reduced value for the exit probability p),

3

the sliding variable ξ increases and the contribution of
free diﬀusion to the reaction time (ﬁrst term in 15) be-
comes less signiﬁcant. At the same time, the second term
of eq. (15) is growing. Depending on the choice of system
parameters, there may be a turning point where the lat-
ter contribution over-compensates the former, so that the
total reaction time increases once ξ is growing further.

For a random walk model as simple as used here,
this analytical formula describes the reaction times well
within 10% tolerance, as long as the following conditions
are satisﬁed: (1) ξ ≪ R, i.e. the sliding parameter should
be small compared to the system size. This restriction
assures the correct normalization of the protein’s prob-
ability distributions and the diﬀusion eﬃciencies as dis-
cussed in [8]. (2) During the diﬀusion process, the system
reaches its equilibrium, so that the constant K repre-
sents the average times the protein spends in free and
in non-speciﬁcally bound mode. This requires either a
crowded environment (the chain-density inside the cell is
high enough) or a reasonably small value for ξ, since the
initial position of the walker is always at the periphery
and outside the chain, i.e. not in equilibrium. (3) ξ < lp,
where lp is the persistence length of the chain. This
restriction accounts for the assumption that the walker
moves along an approximately straight line during one
sliding period. However, numerical tests have shown that
deviations from a straight geometry actually have little
impact to the accuracy of the model. (4) The step-size
of the random walk has to be small compared to the size
of the binding site.

It should be pointed out that an analytical approach
as simple as that is by no means supposed to simulate
the actual situation in a living cell. Instead, it serves as
a platform for a much wider class of semi-empirical mod-
els. The sliding-parameter ξ contains the aﬃnity of non-
speciﬁc protein-DNA binding and is ﬂexible to vary with
the potential chosen for the simulation. The diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients D1d and D3d can be adapted to experimental
measurements, and the target size ra contains protein-
speciﬁc reaction probabilities. These parameters can be
ﬁtted to either describe system-speciﬁc experimental re-
sults or the output of more sophisticated numerical codes
which would otherwise not permit any analytical treat-
ment.

3. NUMERICAL MODEL

In order to approximate the real biological situation,
the DNA was modeled by a chain of straight segments of
equal length l0. Its mechanical stiﬀness was deﬁned by
the bending energy associated with each chain joint:

Eb = kBT α θ2 ,

(18)

where α represents the dimensionless stiﬀness parame-
ter, and θ the bending angle. The numerical value of α
deﬁnes the persistence length (lp), i.e. the “stiﬀness” of
the chain. The excluded volume eﬀect was taken into

account by introducing the eﬀective chain radius rc. The
conformations of the chain, with distances between non-
adjacent segments smaller than rc, were forbidden. The
target of speciﬁc binding was assumed to lie exactly in
the middle of the DNA. The whole chain was packed in
a spherical volume (cell) of radius R in such a way that
the target occupied the central position.

To achieve a close packing of the chain inside the cell,
we used the following algorithm. First, a relaxed confor-
mation of the free chain was produced by the standard
Metropolis Monte-Carlo (MC) method. For the further
compression, we deﬁned the center-norm (c-norm) as the
maximum distance from the target (the middle point) to
the other parts of the chain. Then, the MC procedure
was continued with one modiﬁcation. Namely, a MC step
was rejected if the c-norm was exceeding 105% of the low-
est value registered so far. The procedure was stopped
when the desired degree of compaction was obtained.

The protein was modeled as a random walker within
the cell with reﬂecting boundaries. During one time-step
it was displaced by the distance dr in a random direc-
tion. Once approaching the chain closer than its radius
rc deﬁning the “non-speciﬁc binding pipe”, it was al-
lowed to enter it freely and continue its random walk
inside. Upon crossing the pipe boundary from inside, it
was either allowed to pass with the exit probability p or
otherwise reﬂected back inside, as described in Section
2.2.

Below in this paper, one step dt was chosen as the unit
of time and one persistence length lp = 50 nm of the
DNA chain as the unit of distance. The following values
of parameters were used. The length of one segment was
chosen as l0 = 0.2, so that one persistence length was
partitioned into 5 segments. The corresponding value of
the stiﬀness parameter was α = 2.403 [10]. The chain
radius was rc = 0.06, and the active site was modeled as
a sphere of identical radius ra = 0.06 embedded into the
chain. The step-size of the random walker both inside
and outside the chain was dr = 0.02, corresponding to
a diﬀusion coeﬃcient D3d = D1d = dr2/6 = 2 · 10−4/3.
This choice was a compromise between accuracy and sim-
ulation time. Tests have conﬁrmed that a smaller step-
size could somewhat reduce the gap between theoretical
(eq. 15) and simulated reaction time at small values of ξ.

4. COMPUTATION OF THE SPECIFIC
RECURRENCE TIME

To compute the speciﬁc recurrence time ˜τR of eq. (14),
a very small test system is suﬃcient. Moreover, the com-
putations can be carried out for the collisions from within
the speciﬁc binding site of radius ra [9]. The entire sys-
tem, i.e. the sphere and a short piece of chain, was embed-
ded into a cube of 4ra side-length with reﬂective walls.
In principle, the size of the cube should be of no rele-
vance, but it was found that, if chosen too small, eﬀects
of the ﬁnite step-size were emerging. The walker started

4

inside the sphere. Each time upon leaving the spherical
volume a collision was noted. If the walker was about to
exit the cylindrical volume of the chain, it was reﬂected
back inside with the probability 1 − p. The clock was
halted as long as the walker moved outside the sphere
and only counted time-steps inside the sphere. Since the
binding site was embedded into the chain, its eﬀective
volume (eq. 12) was simply Veﬀ = Va/p, with Va being
the volume of the speciﬁc binding site.

Table I contains the results for 12 diﬀerent values of the
exit probability p. The recurrence time τ ∗
R does in fact
depend on p, although the spherical volume Va is fully
embedded into the chain. The reason is that within one
time-step, the walker may leave the sphere, but, depend-
ing on p, subsequently reﬂected back from the chain’s
periphery into the binding site. Such a move is not ac-
counted as a collision (there are no fractional time-steps).
The computational cost of these simulations is negligible
— Millions of cycles are carried out within minutes on a
PC, and the statistical error of ˜τR can be made negligibly
small.

5. MODEL SYSTEMS OF VARIOUS SIZES

Next, simulations were carried out for cells of diﬀerent
volumes Vi = 4π R3
i /3 (see table II for a summary of the
system parameters). The chain lengths Li were chosen so
that the density Li/Vi remained of the same order around
3/4. First, the chain conformation was generated using
the procedure of Section 3. Then, each simulation cycle
started at the periphery of the active binding site (state
A) and ended as soon as the periphery of the cell (state

B) was reached. Whenever the walker returned back to
the binding site (r < ra), one collision was noted. As
long as the walker remained inside the binding site, the
clock was halted. For each value of the exit parameter p,
which is related to the walker-chain aﬃnity via eq. (9),
2000 cycles were carried out and the measurements were
averaged, so that statistical ﬂuctuations were reduced to
about 2%. The simulations provided measurements of
τAB, the average time to reach B when starting from
A, and hNcolli, the number of returns to A on the way
towards B. Equations (13) and (4), which form the core
of the MEC approach, were then applied to evaluate τBA.
Additionally, τBA was simulated explicitly, starting from
B, as a veriﬁcation of the speed-up and accuracy of the
MEC approach. The results are summarized in table II.
In order to clarify the procedure, we shall ﬁrst discuss
the simulation of the largest cell R = 4.8 in more detail.
Figure 1 displays the chain conformation inside the
spherical cell in a 2-dimensional projection. The speciﬁc
binding site is located at the center of the cell. Note that,
wherever possible, the chain contour, constructed of 1729
cylindrical segments, tries to avoid large bond angles, a
result of the bending potential as discussed in Section 3.
Table I contains details of the simulation results for 12
diﬀerent values of the exit parameter p, varied as p = 2−l,
l = 0, . . . , 11. The second column is the sliding param-
eter eq. (17). With increasing protein-chain aﬃnity, the
walker is spending more time inside the chain volume so
that the sliding parameter is growing in size, reaching

a value of almost two persistence lengths at p = 2−11.
The following two columns are the recurrence time τ ∗
R
and ˜τR as discussed in Sec. 4. The next column is the
number of collisions N (eq. 5). The more time it spends
inside the chain contour, i.e. with increasing inﬂuence of
facilitated diﬀusion, the more often the walker returns
back to state A to cause a collision, before being able to
reach state B for the ﬁrst time to ﬁnish the cycle. From
p = 1 (free diﬀusion) to p = 2−11, the value of N gains
almost two orders of magnitude. The next column is the
average reaction time τAB of the direction A → B. This
quantity initially remains almost constant, but at higher
values of protein-chain aﬃnity it begins to grow rapidly.
The reason is because the walker becomes more and more
trapped inside the chain volume and is unable to access
the cell periphery as eﬀectively as it does during free
diﬀusion. The next column is the reaction time τBA of
the reaction B → A as delivered by the MEC approach
using eq. (4). The recurrence time τR was determined
using eq. (13), with the eﬀective volume of eq. (12) and
the speciﬁc recurrence time ˜τR (column 4). The next
column contains τBA as obtained by direct simulations.
When averaged over all data points, both results for τBA
diﬀered by 2.4%. As shown in the last column, the ratio
τBA/τAB was of the order 10-100. This deﬁnes the speed-
up of the MEC approach over the explicit simulation of
τBA. Integrated over all data points, the total speed-up
was equal to 33.4.

t
Figure 2 displays the ﬁrst reaction times τBA as a func-
tion of the sliding parameter ξ. Both methods (explicit
simulation and MEC approach) deliver identical results
within the statistical errors. The solid curve is a plot
of the analytical estimate eq. (15), which consistently
under-estimates the ﬁrst reaction time by 5-10% but oth-
erwise describes the trends accurately, including the lo-
cation of the minimum. The results prove that facili-
tated diﬀusion is able to accelerate the reaction consid-
erably. It is also obvious that a very high aﬃnity of the
protein to the chain becomes counter-productive: The
walker spends long periods of time trapped within a par-
ticular loop of the chain without being able to explore
the remaining parts of the cell exhaustively. Ideally, the
aﬃnity has to be chosen so that the walker is occasionally
able to dissociate from the chain and associate again af-
ter having passed some time in free diﬀusion. The actual
value of the ideal aﬃnity depends on the system param-
eters and is easily estimated using eq. (15) prior to any
simulations.

Table II contains a summary of the simulation results
for various system sizes.
It appears that the speed-up
delivered by the MEC approach increased proportional
to the square of the cell radius, and gained a signiﬁcant
dimension in the largest of our test systems. Whereas a
cell as small as R = 1.2 was treated within 30 minutes on
a PC, including 2000 runs of explicit simulation B → A
for 12 diﬀerent values of the exit probability p, the large
cell of R = 4.8 required more than 5 days for the same set
of computations. The MEC method reduced that time
to less than four hours.

6. SUMMARY

In this work, the method of excess-collisions (MEC),
recently introduced as a technique to speed up the sim-
ulation of intramolecular reactions in polymers, is gen-
eralized to second order diﬀusion controlled reactions,
and applied to the problem of facilitated diﬀusion of site-
speciﬁc DNA-binding proteins. This method is based on
eq. (4) and (13) to simulate the much faster back-reaction

A → B (protein starts at the binding site and propagates
to the cell-periphery) instead of B → A. We have demon-
strated how MEC led to a speed-up of up to two orders of
magnitude, depending on protein-DNA aﬃnity (Table I),
and gaining signiﬁcance with increasing cell size (Table
II).

The cell model employed in this work was perhaps the
most simple ansatz that was possible without being triv-
ial, and intentionally so. The simulations had to cover
a large range of system sizes in order to verify the ef-
ﬁciency of the MEC approach. The chain-lengths span
a factor of 64 from the smallest to the largest system.
Nevertheless, the validity of our results does not depend
on the complexity of the model, such as protein-DNA
potential, which modiﬁes the equilibrium constant K in
eq. (10) and thereby the sliding parameter ξ (eq. 16),
hydrodynamic interactions, which would lead to eﬀective
diﬀusion coeﬃcients, also modifying ξ, or the introduc-
tion of protein orientation and conformation, acting on
the eﬀective target size ra. The speed-up is consistently
evaluated in terms of simulation steps, not CPU-time,
to ensure invariance on the complexity of the underly-
ing protein/DNA model. Based on the results presented
here, the MEC approach can be expected to reduce the
numerical eﬀort by orders of magnitude, once more so-
phisticated (and time consuming) simulation techniques
are employed to study biochemical reaction times in sys-
tems of realistic dimensions.

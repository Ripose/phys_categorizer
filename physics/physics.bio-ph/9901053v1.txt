Abstract

We supplement a negative feedback component on an Ising model with a

magnetic ﬁeld randomly applied to a fraction of spins.

If this feedback is

slow enough, the system evolves through quasi-equilibrium states. Moreover,

if it is weak enough, the magnetisation always attenuates toward zero and is

always sensitive to subsequent stimulus. This so-called adaptive Ising model

helps us to understand bacterial chemotaxis, controlled by a signal which is

very sensitive initially and always returns to the pre-stimulus level after a

period of time.

Biological systems are distinguished from other physical systems in many aspects, among

which is the awareness of environment: they sensitively respond to stimuli, and can adapt

to changes within a certain limit. For example, a bacterium such as Escherichia coli or

Salmonella typhimurium swims under the control of several ﬂagellar motors. When the mo-

tors rotate counterclockwisely, the bacterium runs forward; when the motors rotate clock-

wisely, it tumbles. The probability ratio of these two modes of rotation is related to the

change of the concentration of ambient chemical, therefore the bacterium performs a biased

random walk toward higher concentration of an attractant or lower concentration of a re-

pellent. This phenomenon is known as bacterial chemotaxis [1–3], which is a paradigmatic

system of cellular signalling and adaptation, and even more general biological complexity.

There are, say, about 2000 chemotactic receptor dimers clustering at a pole of the cell. Each

receptor dimer senses the extra-cellular stimulus and transmits the signal to the motors

through a signalling pathway which consists of several Che proteins.

A crucial feature of chemotaxis is its sensitivity: as little as a single molecule can trigger

a detectable motor response [4,5]. Another crucial feature is adaptation: after an initial

sensitive response, the tumbling rate returns to the pre-stimulus level. The clustering of

receptors intrigued people to consider whether this fact is related to sensitivity [6]. Actually,

we might formulate a biological principle: An attribute that exists most probably confers

advantages over possible alternatives, especially if the latter have some apparent merit. This

principle and various experimental ﬁndings led us to propose a cooperative model based

on coupling among receptor dimers [7]. This model is equivalent to an Ising model in a

bimodally distributed magnetic ﬁeld. It can provide an arbitrarily sensitive initial response,

by choosing appropriate value of a parameter comparing the coupling with the noise. In this

theoretical framework, the adaptation is achieved by a counteracting eﬀect which maps to

an induced ﬁeld opposite to the original one on the Ising model. In chemotaxis, this eﬀect

is due to a negative feedback loop in the signalling pathway. It is interesting to make more

investigations on adaptation combined with sensitivity, and explain why the adaptation is

always perfect, i.e. the activity always returns to the pre-stimulus level precisely. Recent

2

experiments showed that this perfectness of adaptation is robust though other properties,

such as the time needed to complete the adaptation, change with conditions [8]. As an

example of perfectness exhibited in some biological processes, such perfect adaptation, we

believe, is necessary for chemotactic machinery to work. Suppose there is a probability

distribution for the diﬀerence between the activity after an adaptation and that after the

previous one, with mean δ and variance ǫ2. Then the central limit theorem tells us that

after n times of stimulus and adaptation, the activity drifts from the original one with mean

nδ and variance nǫ2. n → ∞ in the life of the bacterium, hence unless both δ and ǫ2 are

exactly zero, i.e. the adaptation is perfect, the working range of the chemotactic machinery

has to be unlimited, which is impossible. Thus the viewpoint of evolution may help us to

understand why the adaptation has to be perfect. On the other hand, an underlying physical

mechanism needs to be found.

In this letter, I present a so-called adaptive Ising model

(AIM), which may apply to chemotaxis and explains the perfect adaptation. In AIM, there

is a negative feedback on the ﬁeld. With large separation of time scales, there exists quasi-

equilibrium which is temporally local, compared with a long time scale. On this long time

scale, however, the system evolves, and there is a dynamical attractor, which corresponds to a

ﬁxed pre-stimulus activity of chemotaxis and and a sensitive response to subsequent stimulus.

This explains why chemotactic adaptation is always perfect. Combining cooperativity and

feedback, AIM might be applicable to a variety of biological phenomena.

Consider an Ising model in a magnetic ﬁeld, with the Hamiltonian

H(t) = −

JijSiSj −

Bi(t)Si,

X
<ij>

X
i

where < ij > denotes nearest neighbouring pairs. Jij = J > 0 is a constant. Bi is dependent

on time t. The essential element of AIM is a negative feedback on Bi:

(1)

(2)

dBi(t)
dt

= −σSi(t − tr),

where σ > 0, tr is the retard time of feedback. For the purpose of application in chemotaxis,

here we assume the initial condition as Bi(t < t0) = 0, while Bi(t0) is binomally distributed

between B and 0,

3

p[Bi(t0)] = cδ[Bi(t = t0) − B] + (1 − c)δ[Bi(t0)].

(3)

Note that the randomness is quenched. In other words, the magnetic ﬁeld is superposed by

two parts. One part is the externally applied ﬁeld Bi(t0)θ(t − t0), where θ(x) equals 0 for

x < 0 while equals 1 for x ≥ 0. Another part is an induced ﬁeld, denoted as Mi(t), with

dMi(t)
dt

= −σSi(t − tr).

Generally, AIM deﬁnes a nonequilibrium model. However, suppose the time dependence

of Bi(t) is very slow, in other words, the time scale of the overall physical process, char-

acterized by tr, is very long, compared with the time needed to achieve temporally local

equilibrium. Hence we may replace the above Hamiltonian with a temporally coarse grained

one

H(τ ) = −

JijSiSj −

Bi(τ )Si,

X
<ij>

X
i

where τ is the coarse grained and discretized time deﬁned as τ = int(t/T ). Here the function

int(x) ≤ x represents the integer least less than x, T = tr is the coarse graining factor, which

is much longer than the time needed to achieve quasi-equilibrium. H(τ ) determines, through

the equilibrium statistical mechanics, the coarse grained instantaneous state characterised

by the magnetisation per spin m(τ ), which is the value of Si(τ ) for every spin i. Note

that Si(τ ) is the average of Si(t) over the time period from (τ − 1)T to τ T , equal to the

thermal average < Si >. The dependence of m(τ ) on τ enters through the monitoring of

Bi as an argument of its function m(τ ). Such an approach is clearly a sort of adiabatic

approximation.

distributes between 0 and B, i.e.

On the coarse grained time scale, the initial condition becomes that Bi(τ0) binomally

p[Bi(τ0)] = cδ[Bi(τ = τ0) − B] + (1 − c)δ[Bi(τ0)],

where τ0 =

(t0/tr). The feedback equation becomes

obtain [7]:

Under the adiabatic approximation, we apply mean ﬁeld theory for each instant τ to

m(τ ) =

2c
1 + exp[−2β(νJm(τ ) + M(τ ) + B)]
2(1 − c)
1 + exp[−2β(νJm(τ ) + M(τ ))]

+

− 1,

where M(τ ) is given by (9), β = 1/kBT , ν is the number of nearest neighbors.

One may observe that m = 0 is a ﬁxed point of Eq. (11): if m(τ − 1) = 0, then m(τ ) =

m(τ − 1) = 0. Moreover, if σ < νJ, m(τ ) does not change the sign while its magnitude

decreases toward 0. Therefore m = 0 is an attractor of the evolution of magnetisation.

In the original Ising model with c = 0, there are two phases, ferromagetic and paramag-

netic, depending on βνJ. For AIM, however, as an interesting consequence of the feedback,

m(c = 0) is always zero: suppose initially m(c = 0) is nonzero, the feedback automatically

causes it to attenuate to zero. Therefore, we always have m(τ < τ0) = 0, consequently

m(τ ≥ τ0) =

1 + exp[−2β(νJm(τ ) − θ(τ − τ0 − 1)σ

P

− 1,

(11)

where θ(τ ) equals 1 for τ ≥ 0 and equals 0 otherwise, M0 = M(τ0) is 0 for βνJ ≤ 1 and is

nonzero for βνJ > 1.

Thus when a magnetic ﬁeld is applied to the system, randomly but with a certain occu-

pancy c, there is an initial change in the value of magnetisation from 0 to m(τ0), dependent

5

on c. This initial response can be arbitrarily sensitive, as seen from ∂m/∂c, given by Eq.

(10) of Ref. [7], with νJm0 there replaced by M0. However, due to the negative feedback

of the output (magnetisation) on the input (ﬁeld) at each spin, the magnetisation always

attenuates toward zero.

To obtain some analytical sense, consider the high temperature limit β → 0. In this

case, m(τ0) = cβB/(1 − βνJ) [7]. A simple calculation based on Eq. (11) reveals that

m(τ0 + ∆τ ) = [1 − βσ/(1 − βνJ)]∆τ m(τ0). When βσ < 1 − βνJ, a more relaxed condition

than the general suﬃcient condition σ < νJ, m(τ ) attenuates toward zero exponentially.

For lower temperature, due to larger eﬀective coupling βνJ, the attenuation is clearly more

rapid. Therefore the adaptation in our model is very eﬀective.

For general values of the parameters, the solution can only be obtained numerically, as

shown in Fig. 1. Note that the eﬀective parameters are βνJ, βB, βσ, and c. Comparing

plots for diﬀerent values of parameters, one can observe that the speed of attenuation of

m(τ ) increases with βσ, with βνJ, and decreases with c. It increases with βB, but when

βB is large enough, m(τ ) becomes independent of the exact value of βB, as indicated by

the results for βB = 1, 10 with βνJ = 0.5. On log-log scale (not shown), the plots are

generally convex, indicating that the attenuation is generally more rapid than exponential

decay, consistent with the above analysis based on the exponential decay in β → 0 limit.

Now let us turn to chemotaxis. The signalling pathway, as depicted in Fig. 2, is as

follows [1–3]. The chemoeﬀector molecule ligands bind to transmembrane receptor dimers,

which are coupled by two proteins CheW to two cytoplasmic histidine kinases CheA, form-

ing a 2:2:2 complex. CheA is autophosphorylated with the rate greatly enhanced by the

receptor. Attractant binding causes the receptor dimer to undergo a conformational change

which leads to a decrease of autophosphorylation rate of CheA. CheA transfers phospho-

rylation group to two response regulators CheB and CheY. Phospho-CheY modulates the

motors. Phospho-CheB mediates demethylation of the receptor, while another regulator

CheR promotes methylation. Attractant binding also makes the receptor better substrate

for CheR. Since methylation increases the autophosphorylation rate of CheA, Phospho-CheB

6

(and CheR) provides a negative feedback loop responsible for adaptation.

Similar to Hopﬁeld neural network model [9], under the assumption of high-gain limit, we

characterise the state of the receptor dimer as Vi = V 0, V 1, corresponding to the higher and

lower rate of CheA autophosphorylation respectively, and assume McCulloch-Pitts behavior.

That is, in the absence of noise,

Vi = ψ(

TijVj + Hi − Ui), with ψ(x) =

X
j

(12)

V 1 if x > 0

V 0 if x ≤ 0

,





where Ui is a threshold value, Tij describing coupling among neighbouring receptor dimers.

Hi is the eﬀect of ligand binding and methylation level change. With Tij = Tji and Tii = 0,

there exists a Lyapunov function (Hamiltonian) which determines the equilibrium state.

For convenience, one may use the spin representation Si = 2(Vi − V 0)/∆V − 1, where

∆V = V 1 − V 0. With the deﬁnition J = Jij = Tij∆V 2/4 and Bi = Hi∆V /2, assuming

that the “magnetisation” is zero at paramagnetic phase when Bi = 0, and taking into

account the negative feedback on Bi due to the change of methylation level, we may ﬁnd

that the Hamiltonian becomes that of AIM. Here Bi = B if the receptor dimer i is bound

to ligand, otherwise Bi = 0. B > 0 for attractant binding while B < 0 for repellent

binding. c is the the fraction of the receptor dimers with ligand bound. The response of

the system, i.e., the change of the number of receptor dimers with conformation state V 0,

is given by m/2. Furthermore, the large separation of time scales indeed holds:

ligand

binding and conformation change occur within only millisecond, demethylation reactions

take about 0.1 seconds, while time needed to complete adaptation, which is associated with

the slow modulation of methylation level, is on the scale of minutes [1]. This situation

makes adiabatic approximation valid. Roughly speaking, the demethylation reaction time

corresponds to the retard time of feedback, which was set to the coarse grained factor above.

Therefore according to the above analysis on AIM, after an initial response dependent on c,

m(τ ) always attenuates toward zero. Practically, the adaptation is thought to be completed

when the diﬀerence of m(τ ) with zero is below the detectable threshold of the motors.

After the adaptation is completed, if there is a change in the chemoeﬀector concentration,

attenuates towards zero, repeating the dynamics of Eq. (11). ∂m(τ ′

0, c′ = 0)/∂c′, approxi-

mately equal to ∂m(τ0, c = 0)/∂c for Eq. (11) , is arbitrarily large if the latter is arbitrarily

large. Therefore our adaptation mechanism not only brings the response to the pre-stimulus

level, but also preserves the sensitivity, as required by chemotaxis.

Therefore we have explained why perfect adaptation can always be achieved in chemo-

taxis: a ﬁxed pre-stimulus activity is a dynamical attractor. There is, of course, a require-

ment that the parameter σ should be suﬃcient small. This is reasonable and does not

contradict robustness since σ can well vary under this basic requirement. The values of

parameters only aﬀect the time needed to achieve perfect adaptation.

Recent distance-diﬀerence analyses of the aspartate receptor revealed that attractant

binding induces a displacement of one of four helices, each two of which constitute a subunit

of a receptor dimer [10,11]. Therefore Vi may be identiﬁed as the position of the mobile

helix [12]. V 0 is the original position of the helix, corresponding to the higher rate of CheA

autophophorylation. V 1 is down toward the cytoplasm, corresponding to the lower rate of

CheA autophosphorylation. Thus H is the force generated by ligand binding. 2B = H∆V

is the shift of energy diﬀerence between the two conformations due to free energy exchange

8

with the bound ligand, or the work done by the generated force. One may calculate that

4J/∆V is the force due to the activity change of one nearest neighbour. 2Mi(t)/∆V is the

force due to feedback, and thus should be opposite to the force generated by ligand binding.

In the high temperature limit, when ∆τ = −ln2/ln[1 − βσ/(1 − βνJ)], m(τ0 + ∆τ ) =

m(τ0)/2. Note that here τ is the ratio between the real time and retard time of feedback,

which is about 0.1s. Assuming 1/β ≈ 4pN · nm, βνJ ≈ 0.5 [7], and the time needed to

complete adaptation be 1 minute, i.e. ∆τ = 600, we may estimate that σ ≈ 0.002pN · nm.

Because the formula is for high temperature limit, the real value of σ is smaller for the

assumed values of parameters. Experimentally, by measuring β, νJ, B and adaptation

time, σ can be determined. On the other hand, σ can also be determined through σ =

−[Mi(t) − Mi(t0)]/

t
t0 Si(t − tr)dt = [M(τ0) − M(τ )]/
R

P

τ −1
τ ′=τ0 m(τ ′). By comparing the results

obtained in diﬀerent ways, the theory may be tested or reﬁned.

Eq. (2) implies that the feedback is assumed to be local. This is because we preserve the

assumption that there exists independent feedback loop for each receptor dimer although

we consider coupling between the states of neighbouring dimers. However, one might make

straightforward extension to include the neighbouring state in the feedback equation, without

changing the qualitative physics. Furthermore, this makes no change in coarse grained

feedback equation. Therefore the large separation of time scales, which validate coarse

graining, makes the essential mechanism not so much dependent on the microscopic details.

This is also an aspect of robustness. Another notable point is that our feedback equation

is based on the experimental result that the methylation level change is mainly caused by

change of phosphorylation of CheB, directly dependent on the receptor activity with a delay

since phosphorylation increases demethylation activity [1–3].

In the kinetic approach of

Barkai and Leibler [13], however, phosphorylation of CheB was not considered explicitly,

and the feedback was based on the assumption that CheB only demethylates receptors

corresponding to the higher rate of CheA autophosphorylation.

To summarize, I propose an adaptive Ising model, which combines cooperativity and

negative feedback. This model is shown to apply to bacterial chemotaxis and explains the

9

perfect adaptation as a dynamical attractor. Both the signal level and the sensitivity of

response are adapted. The large separation of time scales makes the model easily solved

by adiabatic approximation. The change of values of parameters, under a basic require-

ment that the feedback eﬀect is suﬃciently weak, only changes the time needed to complete

adaptation, without aﬀecting its perfectness. This explains the robustness of perfect adap-

tation. Relevant experiments are anticipated, while further investigations on AIM are also

interesting.

We investigate the dynamical properties of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of human in sleep.
By using a modiﬁed random walk method, We demonstrate that the scale-invariance is embedded
in EEG signals after a detrending procedure. Further more, we study the dynamical evolution
of probability density function (PDF) of the detrended EEG signals by nonextensive statistical
modeling. It displays scale-independent property, which is markedly diﬀerent from the turbulent-
like scale-dependent PDF evolution.

-Introduction. The analysis of electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals attracts extensive attentions from various
research ﬁelds, since it can not only help us to under-
stand the dynamical mechanism of human brain activi-
ties, but also be potentially useful in clinics as a criterion
of some neural diseases. Some previous works have been
done on human EEG signals in sleep and other physio-
logical states. In Refs. [1, 2, 3] the correlation dimension
and Lyapunov exponent are calculated to characterize
and discriminate the sleep stage. Lee et al. provides the
evidence of the long-range power law correlations embed-
ded in EEG signals [4]. The mean scaling exponents are
distinguished according to REM (Rapid Eye Movement),
Non-REM and awake stage, and gradually increased from
stage 1 to stage 2, 3 and 4 in non-REM sleep. Hwa et
al.
found the variable scaling behavior in two regions,
and described the topology plots of scaling exponents in
this two regions that reveals the spatial structure of the
nonlinear electric activity [5]. The random matrix the-
ory is performed to demonstrate the existence of generic
and subject-independent features of the ensemble of cor-
relation matrix extracted from human EEG signals [6].
Yuan et al.
found the similar long-range temporal cor-
relations and power-law distribution of the increment of
EEG signals after ﬁltering out the α and β wave [7]. In
the present paper, the Tsallis entropy is used to analyze
a series of human EEG signals in sleep.

We use the MIT-BIH polysomnography data, which is
consist of four-, six- and seven-channel polysomnographic
recordings, each with an ECG signal annotated beat-by-
beat, and an EEG signal annotated with respect to sleep
stages [8]. Records have been sampled at frequency 4
kHZ. Sleep stage was annotated at 30s intervals according
to the criteria of Rechtschaﬀen and Kales, denoted by six
discrete levels-1, 2, 3, 4 REM and awake (stages 1, 2, 3,
4 belong to non-REM sleep) [9]. In the present analysis,
only the samples containing suﬃcient records (at least no
least than ﬁve stages) are considered. A representative

-Scale-invariance of detrended EEG signals. Consider
an EEG series, denoted by {xi} (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ), whose
scaling characteristics are detected through the following
procedure:

Step 1: Construct the proﬁle series, Yj =

j
i=1 xi, j =
1, 2, · · · , N , and consider Yj as the “walk dsiplacement”
of a resultant random walk.

P

Step 2: Divide the proﬁle series into non-overlapping
segments with equal length and ﬁtting each segment with
a second order polynomial function. Regard the ﬁtting
results as the trends, a stationary series can be obtained
by eliminating the trends from the proﬁle series.

Step 3: After the detrending procedure, we deﬁne the
increment of this modiﬁed proﬁle series at a scale s as
∆sYj = Y ∗
is the deviation from the

Assigning the values of parameter s from 21 to 210,
the normalized PDFs of ∆sY exhibit scale-invariant (self-
similar) behaviors as presented in Fig. 2. That is to say,
those PDFs can be rescaled into a single master curve, as
shown in Fig. 3. The scale-invariance of the detrended
EEG signals suggests that the quasi-stationary property
is embedded in the distributions of time scales. There-
fore, it helps us to search for stable distributions to mimic
them.

-Nonextensive statistical modeling of detrended EEG
signals. From the results sketched in the preceding sec-
tion, herein we use the Tsallis entropy to model the
PDFs. The Tsallis entropy is introduced by Tsallis
through generalizing the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs the-
ory [10], which reads,

dxp(x) = 1; q ∈ R).

In the limit q → 1, Sq degenerates

to the
usual Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy as S1 =
−
p(x)ln[p(x)]dx. The optimization (e. g. maximize
Sq if q > 0, and minimize Sq if q < 0) of Sq with the nor-
dxp(x) = 1, as well as with the

where Zq(s) is a normalization constant, β(s) is explic-
itly related to the variance of distribution, and the sub-
script “ + ” indicates that Gq(x, s) is non-negative [11].
Gq→1(x, s) recovers the usual Gaussian distribution. The
q-Gaussian PDF can describe a set of stable distribu-
tions from Gaussian to L´evy regimes [12] by adjusting
the value of q with appropriate time-dependent parame-
ters β(s) and Zq(s) [13]. The distribution falls into L´evy
regimes in the interval 5
3 < q < 3, with q = 5/3 a critical

value.

The results in Fig. 4 show us that the PDFs of awake
stage falls into the L´evy regime with q being equal to
1.94. It exhibits sharp kurtosis and long-tail distribution,
distinguished from those of REM and non-REM stages.
It should be noted that we shift the distributions through
dividing by their standard deviation and only plot part
of them to make the ﬁgures clear. The speciﬁc values of
β(s) for all scales are shown in the Fig. 5. It interests us
that β(s) does not dissipate as the scale increases unlike
the case of β(s) found in ﬁnancial market [14]. In other
words, It demonstrates that the dynamics evolution of
EEG signals is not coincident with the diﬀusion process
described by Fokker-Planck equation.

Another signiﬁcant equation of nonextensive statistical

approach is the q-exponential function, which reads

eq(x, s) =

{1 − τ (s) [(1 − q)|x − x(s)|]}

where the parameter τ (s) is the relaxation rate of dis-
tribution. Clearly,
in the limit q → 1, e1(x, s) =
Zq(s) exp{−τ (s)|x − x(s)|}. Because the statistic distri-
butions of detrended increment of EEG signals in sleep
stage exhibit an approximately exponential form, we use
the q-exponential model to quantiﬁes them, as shown in
Fig. 4. The values of q for the REM and non-REM stage
are little larger than 1. It means that the ﬂuctuation of
human brain activity in sleep stage will converge to a nor-
mal exponential pattern. In particular, the EEG signals
exhibit q-invariant pattern for diﬀerent time scales in all
the four stages within non-REM sleep. The relaxation
rates of distributions are also approximately invariant,
as shown in the Fig. 5. However, in the REM stage, the
values of q are slight change because of ﬁtting the tail
of distribution in diﬀerent time scales, and the model
can only well ﬁt the center distribution. It suggests that
brain electric activity in the REM stage may work in a
more complex pattern than awake and non-REM stage
for the acute neural activity [15].

The nonextensive statistical approach modeling the de-
trended increment’s PDF of EEG signals with an in-
variant parameter q demonstrates the scale-independent
property of the system. In order to further test the exis-
tence of this observed property, we randomize the empir-
ical series of awake stage by shuﬄing [16, 17] and show a
ﬁt for this artiﬁcial distributions at diﬀerent scales in the
Fig. 6. Clearly, the parameter q will approach to Gaus-
sian regime (q = 1) as the time scale increases. This
result strongly supports the scale-independent property
of human brain activity in sleep is remarkably diﬀerent
from the turbulent-like scale-dependent evolution [18].

-Conclusion. In this work, several dynamical proper-
ties of human EEG signals in sleep are investigated. We
ﬁrstly use a modiﬁed random walk method to construct
the proﬁle series including the information of EEG sig-
nals. After a detrending procedure, we obtain the sta-
tionary series and deﬁne the increments of the resultant

4

random walk at multiple scales. In order to character-
ize the dynamical process of brain electronic activity, we
then study the P (0, s) of the PDF of normalized incre-
ments as a function of s. With this choice we investigate
the point of each probability distribution that is least ef-
fected by the noise introduced by experimental data set.
The scale-invariance in both awake and sleep stages are
obtained, thus one can rescale the distributions at diﬀer-
ent scales into a single master curve.

Aim at this property, we use nonextensive statistical
approach to model these processes. The dynamical evo-
lution of detrended increment’s PDF in awake stage can
be well ﬁtted by q-Gaussian distribution with a invariant
parameter q = 1.94. It demonstrates that the PDFs of
awake stage fall into the l´evy regime. Contrastively, q-
exponential distribution is used to mimic PDFs of sleep
stage. In particular, for the non-REM stage, it exhibits
scale-independent distributions, while for REM stage, it
suggests a complex distributional form with the values of
q slightly diﬀerent.

The statistical properties of distribution of EEG sig-
nals strongly indicate that the process of brain electric
activity is remarkably diﬀerent from tubulent-like cas-
cade evolution. In a recent work [18], Lin-Hughson pro-
posed a tubulent-like cascade model to mimic the human
heart-rate, whose validity is, now, in the face of challenge
on critical scaling-invariance found in real human heart-
rate processes [19, 20]. Although the electrocardiograph

(ECG) and electroencephalogram are diﬀerent, they have
some common statistical features. We wish this work is
helpful for the in-depth understanding about the under-
lying dynamical mechanism. And, like the correspond-
ing empirical studies on human ECG singles [19, 20], this
work could provide some criterions for theoretical models
on human EEG signals.

These similar results are also found in the ECG signals
of human. Since the work presents the turbulent-like cas-
cade heart rate model to mimic human heart rate, Kiyono
et al.
found that the human heart rate exhibits criti-
cal scaling-invariance, of which the dynamical evolution
of increment’s PDF is diﬀerent from turbulent-like PDF
evolution.

Further more, some very recent works [22, 23] pointed
out that the sleep-wake transitions exhibit a scale-
invariant patterns and embed a self-organized criticality
(see also Ref. [21] for the concept of self-organized crit-
icality). Thus, the dynamical properties of human EEG
signals in sleep suggest that human brain activity in sleep
may relate with a self-organized critical system [24]. Our
empirical result, in some extent, support those conclu-
sions.

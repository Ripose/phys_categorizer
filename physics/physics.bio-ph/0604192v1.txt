Abstract

The ﬂuid shear stress is an important regulator of the cardiovascular system via the endothelium-

derived relaxing factor (EDRF) that is Nitric Oxide. This mechanism involves biochemical reactions

in an arterial wall. The autoregulation process is managed by the vascular tonus and gives the

negative feedback for the shear stress changing. A new mathematical model for the autoregulation

of a blood ﬂow through arteria under the constant transmural pressure is presented. Endothelium-

derived relaxing factor Nitric Oxide, the multi-layer structure of an arterial wall, and kinetic-

diﬀusion processes are taken into consideration. The limit case of the thin-wall artery is analytically

studied. The stability condition for a stationary point of the linearized system is given. The exact

stationary solutions of the origin system are found. The numerical simulation for the autoregulation

system is presented. It is shown the arteria adaptation to an initial radial perturbation and the

transition of the system to new equilibrium state in response on the blood ﬂow changing.

INTRODUCTION

The modeling of a cardiovascular system is the problem of great importance due to

it should be aid for understanding and prediction of various diseases like atherosclerosis,

arteriosclerosis, hypertension, etc. The most often approaches to the problem is a direct

applying of classical hydrodynamics models of ﬂuid ﬂow through elastic shells or tubes [1,

2, 3]. But in some cases, for example, for muscular resistance arteries, it is necessary to take

into account the diﬀerence between an ordinary passive and a ”biological” active tube.

The one way to reach the purpose is a wide discussed eﬀect of the ﬂow-induced vasodila-

tion by Nitric Oxide (NO) radical [4, 5, 6, 7]. For a long time the endothelium cells, covering

the arterial bed surface, was supposed to provide only the friction reduction for the blood

ﬂow through arteria. But since the EDRF was discovered via the comparison of two arterial

rings with and without endothelium by the ability to acetylcholine-dependent smooth mus-

cle relaxation and due to later investigations it was shown the endothelium plays the main

role for the local blood ﬂow regulation. The so-called Endothelium Derived Relaxing Factor

(EDRF) was discovered in 1980 by Robert F. Furchgott [8, 9]. Nitric oxide was proposed

as a signal molecule to set a connection from endothelium to the smooth muscles. The

EDRF-NO mechanism enabled to explain the principle of action for the ﬁrst-aid medicine

Nitroglycerine being used before without understanding.

The mechanical nature of an arterial wall tonus regulation is highlighted in the works [6,

10, 11, 12]. It is perceived that the increasing of a shear stress between the blood ﬂow and

inner arterial surface causes the relaxation in a smooth muscle layer of an arterial wall. This

necessary induces the increasing of the arterial radius and the decreasing of the shear stress

itself. Therefore the process in a whole gives the system with a negative feedback.

There are three main layers in an arterial wall. The ﬁrst, internal layer is intima (i),

the second layer is media (m) and the last one is adventitia (a). The inner boundary of

the intima layer, i.e. the internal arterial surface, is covered with endothelium cells. The

media layer is full of smooth muscle cells. The thicknesses of the layers depend on the type

of artery or arteriole. We mainly consider the muscle resistance arteries which have well

developed muscle layer (media) and non-vanishing intima layer. The typical ratio of intima
thickness to the media one is about 10−1.

The scenario of the ﬂow-induced relaxation is as follows. The increasing shear stress σshear

2

on the surface of endothelium cells opens calcium channels which launch the production of

NO from L-arginine with NO-synthase (NOS) catalysis and then NO diﬀuses with descending

through the intima layer towards the smooth muscle cells in the media layer. As a lipophilic

molecule NO easily penetrates through a cell membrane of a muscle cell and initiate synthesis

of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Ultimately, cGMP stimulates the outﬂow
of intracellular Ca2+ that leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell. The ﬂow-induced

contraction is realized vise versa.

The aim of this paper is to develop and to study the mathematical model for description

of blood ﬂow autoregulation that accumulates a viscoelastic nature of an arterial wall and

the two-layer diﬀusion and kinetic processes for concentrations of the key agents: Nitric
Oxide (NO) and Calcium ions (Ca2+).

The outline of the article is as follows. In the section II we introduce the assumptions of

the model. In the section III we derive the closed system for description of the autoregulation
process. In the section IV the steady-state concentrations of NO and Ca2+ are obtained.

In the section V we study the limit case of a thin-wall artery.

In this case the stability

condition of an equilibrium state of the system is given. In the section VI we consider the

case of passive dilation of an arteria with the fully relaxed muscles. The exact kink-shaped

solution is found. In the section VII the numerical simulation of the autoregulation process

near the stationary state is presented. In the section VIII we summarize and discuss the

obtained results. The appendix A includes the essential notations. The appendix B gives

the approach for ﬁnding exact solution of the passive vessel model.

II. MAIN ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MODEL

We consider the arteria to be axial-symmetric, viscoelastic and incompressible. The

blood is also assumed to be incompressible and Newtonian. The ﬂow is quasi-stationary,

the transmural pressure is constant and the velocity proﬁle is the power generalization of

the Poiseuille’s law. We suppose the dependence of muscular force on calcium concentration
to be linear and the dependence of Ca2+ concentration decreasing ratio on Nitric Oxide

concentration is also linear. The concentration of NO in the endothelium is assumed to be

proportional to the shear stress on an arterial wall [6].

III. THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

Let us consider an arterial segment of length l in the cylindrical coordinate system

(r, θ, x ≡ z). The intima, media, and adventitia layers have coordinates Ri, Rm, Ra re-

spectively.

A. The shear stress dependence on the blood ﬂow

Consider the power generalization velocity proﬁle of the Poiseuille’s ﬂow [3]:

Vx(r, x, t) =

1 −

¯u(x, t)

γ + 2
γ

γ

r
R(t)

(cid:20)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:21)

Here Vx is the axial velocity, ¯u is the cross-sectional averaged axial velocity, R is the arterial

radius and γ is the proﬁle sharpness.

In case of Newtonian ﬂuid with dynamical viscosity µ the shear stress on the wall of

elastic tube is

σshear = −µ

= (γ + 2)µ

= (γ + 2)µ

¯u

∂ r

r=R
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
where Q = A¯u is the blood discharge through the cross-section with the area A.
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Summarize all the assumptions for the laminar stationary ﬂow, the cross-section averaged

Navier-Stokes equation takes the form of the generalized Hagen-Poiseuille equation:

∆P
l

= 2(γ + 2)µ

Q
πR4

where ∆P is the pressure diﬀerence on an arterial segment with the length l.

It shows the linear dependence of the pressure gradient from the discharge and inversely

proportionality to the fourth power of the arterial radius.

In case of axial-symmetric radial perturbations R(t) = R0 + η(t) we have from (2):

There is a hypothesis of maintaining the shear stress principle σshear = const [6, 13]. One

can conclude the increasing of the ﬂow necessitate the increasing of the steady-state arterial

radius to compensate the changing of the shear stress. The estimated relation between the

new steady-state discharge and new stationary radius is as follows:

σshear =

(γ + 2)µ

(5)

It is remarkable the diﬀerence of reaction for increasing and decreasing the blood ﬂow

near the previous stationary value. The changing of the radius in response to higher ﬂow is

smaller than for the same lower ﬂow. It is explained by the inversely cubic dependence of

shear stress from the radius.

One can see there is the linear dependence between radial perturbation and mean blood

ﬂow in case of small radial perturbations (|η| << R0).

B. The synthesis and diﬀusion of Nitric Oxide

According to the EDRF-mechanism mediated by the ﬂuid ﬂow, the concentration of Nitric

Oxide produced by an endothelium cell is managed by the shear stress value. We consider

the NO transport to the smooth muscle tissue as a diﬀusion process (diﬀusion coeﬃcient is

D1) with a descending (reaction coeﬃcient is δ1). Then it continues to diﬀuse through the

media layer but with another diﬀusion coeﬃcient D2 and reaction coeﬃcient δ2.

The production of Nitric Oxide in an endothelium cell has the shear stress σshear as one

of essential regulators, therefore this process can be described with a kinetic equation:

d ne
d t

= −ke ne + ψ σshear(t)

(6)

where ne is the NO concentration in an endothelium cell, ke is the rate of mass transfer of

NO from the cell, and ψ is the production rate constant.

Under the assumption of quasi-stationary NO production, i.e. that characteristic time

of NO mass transfer from an endothelium cell towards intima layer (τN O−mass−transf er ∼
∆r2/D ≃ 1/528 sec, where D = 3300 µm2/sec, ∆r ≃ 2.5 µm [18]) is smaller than the

typical time of σshear changing (τshear ∼ τradius−oscillations ∼ 1/2 sec), from equation (6) we

have the following relation between the ne and σshear:

ne(t) =

σshear(t)

ψ
ke

(7)

The relation (7) is used as inner boundary condition for Nitric Oxide diﬀusion through an

arterial wall (n|r=Rintima = ne). Ultimately, at the inner boundary of intima layer we assume

the concentration of NO to be proportional to the shear stress (proportionality coeﬃcient

is k3). Between the intima and media layers we use the continuity of concentrations and

ﬂuxes. On the external layer we take the impenetrability condition into account. Thus the

5

system of equations and the boundary conditions for the Nitric Oxide concentration are as

follows:

The system of equations (8) together with initial conditions describes the two-layer

diﬀusion-kinetic process for the Nitric Oxide in an arterial wall.

C. The equation for the kinetics of the Calcium ions in a smooth muscle cell

To derive the balance-equation for concentration of Ca2+ in a smooth muscle cell it
is necessary to describe the ways of Ca2+ in- and out-ﬂuxes. There are two source of

the calcium ions: the extracellular space and the intracellular containers – sarcoplasmic
reticulum. The concentration of Ca2+ in these sources is about 104 greater than in the

intracellular space. The balance of calcium ions in the muscle cell at the point r may be

described, similarly to [6], as

∂ C(r, t)
∂ t

= −α(C − C0) + β(Cext − C) − k1n2(r, t)

(9)

where the ﬁrst term is responsible for the natural active outﬂow transport of Ca2+ com-

pared to the minimal observed concentration C0, the second term is described a passive

diﬀusion provided by the diﬀerence between the intracellular calcium concentration C and

extracellular ones Cext, and the last term is presented the NO-mediated active outﬂow.

Taking into account the relation Cext >> C we can treat it as a constant source: ϕ0 =

αC0 + βCext = const. In this case the equation (9) can be transformed to the form:

∂ C(r, t)
∂ t

= −αC − k1n2(r, t) + ϕ0

(10)

The equation (10) is used to describe the Calcium-balance in the smooth muscle layer.

D. The equation for an arterial wall movement

In order to obtain the close system of a blood ﬂow autoregulation we need to have a

link between the radial perturbation and the external forces such as pressure and muscular

force [14]. The constitutive equation [15] can be found from the movement equation for an

arterial wall segment.

Let us consider the incompressible viscoelastic wall element with mass ∆m, density ρw,

width h, radius R, and length ∆x. According to the movement law

∆m

d 2R
d t2 = fradial + fpressure,

fradial = −σθθ 2π∆xh,

fpressure = ( ¯P − Pext) 2π∆xh

(11)

where ∆m = ρw2πR∆xh, fradial is proportional to the circumference component of a stress

tensor σθθ and fpressure is the resulting transmural pressure (the diﬀerence between the

internal and external pressure).

The stress tensor component σθθ consists of three parts: a passive elastic force (weakly

nonlinear with quadratic addition), a viscous force and an active force due to the muscle

tonus

σθθ =

square addition, λ is the viscous characteristic of the wall, F (C) is the active force component

determined also by the integral calcium concentration level above the threshold one Cth, k2
is the coeﬃcient of proportionality for the muscular tonus response on the Ca2+ level.

Substitute (12) in (11) and take into consideration the linear dependence of muscle force

on calcium and the incompressibility condition h0R0 = hR. Then the constitutive equation

for the radial perturbations (R = R0 + η, |η| << R0) has a form

One can see in the case of absence of muscle force (full relaxation) it is the equation of

a nonlinear damping oscillator with an external force. The presence of calcium-dependent

tube.

V. THE CASE OF A THIN-WALL ARTERY

To understand the qualitative behavior of the system consider the limit case of a thin wall

artery. The similar model was studied by A. Rachev, S.A. Regirer et al. in [6, 19]. There

are estimations to come to the limit case. The ﬁrst relation is hi/hm << 1 that enables to

come to a one-layer wall model. The second one is τdif f usion << τkinetic, were the typical
time of the diﬀusion process is τdif f usion = h2
τkinetic = min{ 1

are faster than for Calcium ions we have as follows:

where h0 is the characteristic wall thickness to compare with. Taking into account the typical
values of the parameters as D = 3300 µm2/sec and δ = 1 sec−1 [18] we obtain h0 = 57 µm.

It is also should be note the default condition of quasi-stationary diﬀusion: τdif f usion <<

Tosc, where Tosc is the typical period of radial oscillations. The typical value of T −1
1 ÷ 2 sec−1 then the h0 value is close to 57 µm or a bit less.

osc is about

The large and medium resistance muscle arteries have the speciﬁc wall thickness

h ∼ 100 ÷ 1000 µm whereas the small arteries and arterioles have the much smaller thick-

ness h ∼ 10 µm. Therefore the limit case covers the case of ﬂow in a small artery with

h << 50 µm.

Thus the intima and media layers are so thin to neglect the multi-layer nature of the wall

and eliminate the diﬀusion processes.

were x = x(t) ≡ C(x, t) − Cth is the average concentration of Ca2+ in the arterial smooth

muscle layer, y = y(t) ≡ η(t) is the deviation of the radius of the vessel (y > −c), z = z(t)

is the velocity of radius oscillation; α is the rate of a natural ”pumping” of the free calcium

ions from the intracellular space, a is represents the blood ﬂow level (a ∼ Q), c is the

non-perturbed arterial radius, b is the rate of the calcium inﬂow in a smooth muscle cell, A

is the coeﬃcient of proportionality for the calcium-feedback force, κ is the linear elasticity

coeﬃcient, κ1 is the nonlinear elasticity coeﬃcient, κ2 is the small calcium-induced elasticity

coeﬃcient, β is the viscous (resistance) coeﬃcient of an arterial wall, B represents the mean

constant transmural pressure.

Look for the stationary points of the system (38). One can obtain under the condition

there is a stationary point {x = B/A, y = 0, z = 0}. It corresponds to the non-perturbed

state of an artery. All the rest real stationary points of the system have y < −c and

hence they are out of physical sense. The relation (39) reﬂects the balance between the

muscle forces mediated by calcium concentration and the pressure forces in the blood. The
steady-state Ca2+ concentration is equal to x = B/A ∼ P0/(h0R0).

Study the stability of the dynamical system (38) near the stationary point {B/A, 0, 0}

It shows the importance of the viscoelastic nature of an arterial wall to maintain the stability

of the stationary state. In general case, there is the critical wall viscosity βcritical below that

oscillations demonstrate the lack of stability.

The qualitative analysis on the phase plane conﬁrms the preliminary estimates (ﬁgure 2).

VI. THE CASE OF A PASSIVE VESSEL

One can see from the thin-wall approximation the more the discharge the less the equi-
librium calcium level. In the general model we have a non-constant distribution of Ca2+

threshold level Cth it becomes a fully relaxed. In this case the ’active’ viscoelastic tube is

reduced to the ’passive’ one. The law of the arterial wall motion (26) in the dimensionless

form (primes are omitted) is as follows:

The kink-shaped solution demonstrates the switch from one steady state to another under

a constant force ﬁeld.

Here the solution (43) satisﬁes a non-perturbed state of artery with η(0) = 0. The

pressure and smooth-muscle force compensate each other. After a vanishing of the muscle

force (due to the sharp decreasing of the calcium level) arteria expands to a new equilibrium

state.

The new arterial radius depends on the transmural pressure and the elastic properties of

an arterial wall. It can be estimated by η∞.

VII. THE NUMERICAL SIMULATION FOR THE PROBLEM OF BLOOD FLOW

AUTOREGULATION

Consider the general case of the two-layer kinetic-diﬀusion system in the dimensionless

form (23) – (28) for description of the blood ﬂow regulation. In order to study the dynamics

of the solutions of the system near the steady state the numerical simulation is performed. An

implicit iterative ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme is implemented. As the initial values the perturbed

exact stationary solutions (30), (35) are taken.

The behavior of the solution for the initial stretching of the radius conﬁrms the asymptotic

stability of the stationary state (ﬁgure 3).

As a test solution in case of passive dilation the exact solution (43) is taken.

solution (43) (dotted line) and the numerical one (solid line).

In response on the changing of the blood ﬂow, that is managed by the coeﬃcient k1 ∼ Q,

the system comes after the damping oscillations to a new steady state (ﬁgure 5).

It is

remarkable the diﬀerent reaction of the system to the increasing and decreasing of the

discharge. The relaxation time in case of ﬂow decreasing is smaller than in case of ﬂow

increasing. It may be explained by the drop of the critical viscosity level in response on

16

the decreasing ﬂow according to (41). Also the arterial radius deviation is bigger in case of

decreasing of blood ﬂow accordingly to the inverse cubic dependence of the shear stress on

the radius. In case of increasing ﬂow it is vice versa.

One can see the growth of the blood ﬂow can potentially be a source of instability espe-

cially for small arterial wall viscosity near the critical one.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The two-layer diﬀusion-kinetic model is proposed to describe the process of a local blood

ﬂow regulation in an artery. The exact stationary distributions of the key agents – Nitric

Oxide and Calcium ions are obtained.

The limit case of a thin wall artery under the estimation of the wall thickness (37)

is analytically studied. The stability condition for the equilibrium state is given by the

formula (41). It is shown the necessity of the viscoelastic nature (non-zero viscosity) of the

arterial wall to provide the stability of the system. The minimal critical viscosity value of a

wall is obtained in the linearized case.

In case of full relaxation of the smooth muscles the exact solution in the kink form is

found to describe the passive dilation of the artery.

The numerical simulation demonstrates the transition of the system to the new steady

state with the new radius value in response of changing of the mean blood discharge. This

17

result is in agreement with the experimental observation [4]. It is conﬁrmed the importance

of the endothelium derived relaxing factor – Nitric Oxide for arterial haemodynamics.

The model can be applied to the study of the local autoregulation of the coronary, cerebral

and kidney blood ﬂow.

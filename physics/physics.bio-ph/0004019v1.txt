Noise aids the encoding of continuous signals into pulse
sequences by way of stochastic resonance and endows the en-
coding device with a preferred frequency. We study encoding
by a threshold device based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck pro-
cess, equivalent to the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model.
Preferred frequency, optimum noise intensity, and optimum
signal-to-noise ratio are shown to be linearly related to the
AC amplitude of the input signal. The DC component of the
input tunes the device either into transmission (preferred fre-
quency nearly independent of signal amplitude) or selection
mode (frequency rising with amplitude). We argue that this
behavior may facilitate selective signal processing in neurons.

I. INTRODUCTION

Our view of noise has shifted markedly over the past
two decades: After it had long been seen merely as a
nuisance, geophysicists ﬁrst suggested in 1981 that noise
may amplify the eﬀect of weak periodic signals on dy-
namic systems [1]. This eﬀect, called stochastic reso-
nance (SR), has since been found in a variety of exper-
iments. The origin of stochastic resonance in both dy-
namical and non-dynamical systems is well understood
today, although theories are mostly conﬁned to slow sig-
nals. A recent review of the ﬁeld can be found in Ref. [2].
The ﬁnding that noise may aid signal detection and
transmission has spurred intense research in the neuro-
sciences, where scientists have long been puzzled by the
seeming irregularity of neuronal activity. The beneﬁts
of noise for signal processing in neurons have now been
demonstrated in a wide range of species: neurons trans-
duce a signal (or stimulus) optimally if a certain amount
of ambient noise is present [3]; see Ref. [4] for a review.
Recent studies by ourselves [5] and other authors [6]
have revealed a further noise-induced resonance eﬀect
in model neurons: There is also an optimum signal fre-
quency, for which the neuron responds with spike trains
(output signals) that have a particularly high signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR). In this letter, we show that this res-
onance frequency and the optimum noise amplitude are
linearly related to the AC component of the signal im-
pinging on a neuron, while the DC component serves as
tuning parameter. We argue that these relations permit
the neuron to switch between a signal transmission and
a signal selection mode of operation.

1

The present work is based on the integrate-and-ﬁre
neuron model, which will brieﬂy be reviewed in Sec. II,
before the noise-induced response properties of the neu-
ron are presented in Sec. III. Implications for neuronal
signal processing are discussed in Sec. IV. More details
are contained in Ref. [7].

II. MODEL

We focus on the spike generator of neurons for the
sake of both simplicity and generality. The spike gener-
ator integrates the net input current I(t) impinging on
the neuron like a leaky capacitor. For sinusoidal input
superimposed with white noise, the potential v(t) across
the capacitor (the membrane potential) is thus governed
by [8]

˙v(t) = −v(t) + µ + q cos(Ωt + φ) + σξ(t).

(1)

The input is characterized by the DC oﬀset µ, the sig-
nal amplitude q, the frequency Ω, and the (arbitrary)
initial phase φ. The noise term with root mean square
amplitude σ and autocorrelation hξ(t)ξ(t′)i = δ(t − t′)
subsumes the noise arising both from cell biochemistry
[9] and background activity in the neuronal network
[10]. The neuron emits a stereotyped voltage pulse (a
spike) whenever the membrane potential reaches a ﬁr-
ing threshold v(tk) = 1 = Θ; the potential is reset to
v(t+
k ) = vr < 1 immediately thereafter. Time and volt-
age are measured in their natural units, i.e., the mem-
brane time constant τm and the ﬁring threshold Θ.

The spike generator thus operates as an analog-to-
digital converter [11], encoding the continuous input sig-
nal I(t) into a pulse train f (t) = Pk δ(t − tk). Even
though this model is a gross simpliﬁcation of biological
neurons, it has proven most fruitful for investigations of
the nature of the neuronal code [12,13]. For a derivation
of this model from more realistic neuron models, see [14].
We restrict ourselves to sub-threshold signals, which
would not elicit any spikes in the absence of noise, i.e.,
maxt→∞ v(t) = µ + q/√1 + Ω2 < 1 from integration of
Eq. (1). These appear to be more relevant than super-
threshold signals for the encoding of periodic signals [15].
Note that the membrane potential will oscillate about
¯v = µ after an initial transient in the absence of noise.

We measure the performance of the neuron in coding

the sinusoidal input by the signal-to-noise ratio

RSN = S(Ω)/SP

(2)

πTo | R To

of the output spike train at the signal frequency. Here,
S(Ω) = 1
0 f (t)eiΩtdt|2 is the power spectral den-
sity of the train for a given observation time To, while the
white power spectrum of a Poissonian spike train with
equal mean interspike interval hτi, i.e., SP = (πhτi)−1,
is used as reference noise level. To = 200 is employed
throughout [5,16].

III. RESPONSE PROPERTIES

The leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neuron responds best to
sinusoidal stimulation—i.e. attains a maximum signal-
to-noise ratio—at a particular combination of signal fre-
quency Ω and input noise amplitude σ, see Fig. 1. The
location of the SNR maximum is marked by an aster-
isk [16]. In what follows, we shall explore the location
of and the SNR value at this maximum as a function
of the remaining stimulus parameters, namely the signal
amplitude q, the DC oﬀset µ, and the reset potential vr.
In the absence of noise, sub-threshold stimuli evoke
membrane potential oscillations about ¯v = µ as pointed
out in Sec. II. The gap between this average potential
and the threshold, Θ − ¯v = 1 − µ, needs to be bridged
by the concerted eﬀort of signal-induced oscillations and
noise. It is therefore plausible to scale both stimulus and
noise amplitude by this threshold distance, i.e., to deﬁne
relative amplitudes,

qr =

q

1 − µ

and σr =

σ

1 − µ

.

(3)

Furthermore, the reset potential vr should enter only
as the ratio of the reset distance to threshold distance,
which we shall refer to as relative reset

γ =

µ − vr
1 − µ

.

(4)

This scaling can be established rigorously via escape
noise approximations to the dynamics of the integrate-
and-ﬁre neuron [7,17].

r

, and SNR Ropt

We shall now turn to the relation of the optimum tun-
ing parameters (preferred signal frequency Ωopt, scaled
noise amplitude σopt
SN ) to the signal am-
plitude parameters (scaled AC amplitude qr, and relative
reset γ; or DC oﬀset µ and reset potential vr instead of
γ). Figure 2(a) indicates a perfect linear relation between
Ropt
SN , the attainable SNR, and the stimulus amplitude qr,
while the optimum input noise amplitude σopt
r ≈ 0.6−0.7
is practically independent of qr, see Fig. 2(b): variations
of σopt
are about one order of magnitude smaller than
the range of qr values. Both relations are remarkably in-
dependent of the value of the DC oﬀset µ (indicated by
symbol/line type in Fig. 2, supporting the scaling given
in Eq. (3). Ropt
are thus independent of the

r

SN and σopt

r

DC component of the signal transmitted for ﬁxed reset
potential.

r

A diﬀerent behavior is observed for the optimum fre-
quency Ωopt as shown in Fig. 3(a): For large values of γ,
i.e., a strong positive DC oﬀset, the optimum frequency
is nearly independent of the signal amplitude qr, while
small values of γ lead to a marked linear dependence of
Ωopt on qr: the preferred frequency may be selected by a
variation of the signal amplitude. Figure 3(a) also clearly
indicates that the response of the neuron depends on the
DC oﬀset µ and reset potential vr only via the relative
reset γ, vindicating Eq. (4): each data point shown is
a superposition of two almost perfectly coincident points
obtained from diﬀerent (µ, vr)-combinations yielding the
same γ (circles, crosses). The same is found for Ropt
SN and
σopt
(not shown). The results presented here are thus
applicable both to sensory and cortical neurons: the for-
mer are best ﬁt by the model for reset potentials vr ≈ 0
[7], while the latter require vr ≈ 0.7 [13].
Figure 3(a) indicates that the integrate-and-ﬁre neu-
ron may operate in two diﬀerent modes: a transmission
mode for large γ, which optimally encodes stimuli of a
ﬁxed preferred frequency Ωopt ≈ 1 irrespective of their
amplitude, and a selection mode, in which the preferred
frequency may be chosen by variation of the stimulus am-
plitude qr. The slope of the frequency-amplitude curve
(linear least squares ﬁt) as a function of the relative reset
γ is shown in Fig. 3(b). There is a sharp transition be-
tween the selection and transmission modes at γ ≈ 2.1.
No slope could be determined for γ < 1.5, since the pe-
riod of the optimal stimulus 2π/Ωopt tends to the dura-
tion of the observation period To for small amplitudes qr
in this case.

The two modes of operation arise through diﬀerent ﬁr-
ing patterns: For large relative reset (γ > 2), less than
one spike is ﬁred on average per stimulus period, i.e., the
neuron ﬁres at most one well phase-locked spike per pe-
riod, and often skips periods in between spikes, with a
slight increase in spike number with qr. For small reset
(γ < 2), in contrast, the neuron has a bursting ﬁring
pattern for small qr, i.e., two or three spikes are ﬁred in
rapid succession near the maximum of the signal in each
period, followed by silence till the next period. As qr
is increased and the optimum frequency rises, the signal
period becomes too short to harbor more than one spike
and bursting gives way to a more regular ﬁring pattern,
with a little more than one spike per period on aver-
age. For intermediate reset (γ ≈ 2), the neuron ﬁres
almost regularly, with about 0.8 spikes per signal period
independent of qr. Cold receptor neurons show all three
kinds of ﬁring patterns (skipping, regular, bursting) de-
pending on ambient temperature [18]; their behavior is
reproduced well by the integrate-and-ﬁre neuron [7].

IV. FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE

Let us summarize the neuronal response properties and
discuss them in turn: (i) The optimal signal-to-noise ratio
scales linearly with the input signal amplitude, and (ii) is
attained at a constant noise amplitude, while (iii) the
preferred frequency is either independent of (transmis-
sion mode) or linearly related to the signal amplitude
(selection mode).

SN ∼ qr ∼ pRin

Property (i) means that the optimal SNR of the spike
train emitted by the neuron is related to the SNR of
the input signal as Ropt
SN [19], in qualita-
tive agreement with recent ﬁndings in a variant model
neuron [20]. This suggests a law of diminishing returns
for the signal-to-noise ratio: there is no point in invest-
ing valuable resources to improve Rin
SN beyond a certain
level, because resulting gains in Ropt
SN would be minimal.
Since the output of each neuron in turn is input to other
neurons, the same argument holds for raising Ropt
SN . The
level of noise observed in the brain might thus reﬂect
an evolutionary compromise between coding quality and
resource consumption.

r

(ii) The independence of the optimum input noise am-
plitude σopt
from signal amplitude makes the integrate-
and-ﬁre neuron a useful signal processing device, as no
ﬁne-tuning of the noise to the signal is required to at-
tain optimal performance. The noise level need only be
adjusted relative to the DC oﬀset, which largely reﬂects
homogeneous background activity. The optimum noise
amplitude of σopt
r ≈ 0.6 − 0.7 (relative to the threshold
distance 1− µ) is in good agreement with the observation
that coincidence detection in the auditory system of barn
owls works best for sub-threshold stimuli which raise the
average membrane potential to roughly one noise ampli-
tude below threshold [15].

Property (iii) is the central ﬁnding reported here: a
model neuron as simple as the integrate-and-ﬁre neu-
ron may switch between two distinct modes of opera-
tion, a transmission and a selection mode. Switching be-
tween the two modes is achieved by variation of the tem-
porally homogeneous background input to the neuron:
weak background activity activates the selection mode,
a strong background the transmission mode. Switching
between modes requires only moderate variations of the
background activity as indicated by Fig. 3(b).
In the
former, an input signal of particular frequency reaching
the neuron through synapses far from the cell body—and
thus the spike generator—may easily be (de-)selected:
modulatory input through synapses closer to the spike
generator need only vary the amplitude q of the net in-
put current I(t) to the spike generator to tune the neu-
ron’s optimum frequency Ωopt either closer to or away
from the given signal frequency Ω. Selected signals are
then coded into spike trains with high signal-to-noise ra-
tio, i.e., trains with clear temporal structure, while de-

selected signals elicit more random output. Since pulse
packets can propagate through networks of neurons only
if they are suﬃciently strong and tight [21], variation of
the SNR provides a means of gating such packets through
neuronal networks.

V. SUMMARY

We have shown here that the ﬁlter properties of a
threshold system exploiting stochastic resonance in the
sub-threshold regime are linearly related to the AC am-
plitude of the input signal, and may be tuned by vari-
ation of the DC signal amplitude. Our results indicate
that such a simple device may, with the aid of noise, pro-
vide the means to selectively transmit signals in neuronal
networks. It might thus harness noise for the beneﬁt of
neuronal computation. Although our study is set in the
framework of neurons as the most widespread threshold
detectors in nature, the results apply more generally to
any threshold system that may be characterized as an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck escape process.

Abstract New model of separated form factors is pro-
posed for the evaluation of small-angle neutron scatter-
ing curves from large unilamellar vesicles. The validity
of the model was checked by comparison to the model
of hollow sphere. The model of separated form factors
and hollow sphere model give reasonable agreement in
the evaluation of vesicle parameters.

Information about the internal membrane structure is
mainly derived from X-ray diﬀraction experiments on
multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) [1]. A single lipid bilayer
possesses the structure typical of most biological mem-
branes. Unilamellar vesicles (ULVs) appear to be more
biologically appealing model of the lipid membrane than
multilamellar vesicles. Moreover, vesicles are used as de-
livery agents of drugs, genetic materials and enzymes
through living cell membrane and other hydrophobic
barriers [2,3]. Today, the problem of accurate and si-
multaneous determination of the vesicle radius, poly-
dispersity, and the internal membrane structure is not
yet solved in SAXS and SANS experiments [5]-[9]. The
information about internal membrane structure derived
from the SANS experiment is based on the strip-function
model of the neutron scattering length density across bi-
layer ρ(x) [4] and application of the hollow sphere model
for the vesicle [5,7]. Important problem is to develop new
approach to the evaluation of SANS and SAXS experi-
mental curves with possibility to describe ρ(x) as an any
analytical or numerical function. The purpose of present
work is to propose and verify the new analytical equa-
tions for the calculation of the SANS curves from the
phospholipid vesicles.

1 Experiment and Model

Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) was purchased
from Sigma (France), and D2O was from Isotop (S.-
Peterburg,Russia). LUVs were prepared by extrusion of
MLVs through polycarbonate ﬁlter with pore diameter
500 ˚A as described in ref. [7]. The spectra from unil-
amellar DPPC vesicles were collected at YuMO small-
angle spectrometer of IBR-2 reactor (Dubna, Russia) at
T = 20◦C [10]. Incoherent background was subtracted
from normalized cross section of vesicles as described in
ref. [5]. DPPC concentration in sample was 1% (w/w).

2 Results and Discussion

The validity of SFF model comparing to HS model was
examined in the approximation of ρ(x) ≡ ∆ρ. Fig. 1
presents experimentally measured coherent macroscopic
cross-section of DPPC vesicles and ﬁtted model curves.
The SFF model was applied via (7),(8),(10),(12), and the
model of hollow sphere via (3),(12). As it is seen from
Fig. 1, both models describe the experimental curve well
enough. Free parameters used in the ﬁt were: average
vesicle radius ¯R, membrane thickness d, and parameter
m in (11).

The results of calculations are presented in Table 1.
Both HS and SFF models ﬁt experimental curve with the
same accuracy, the diﬀerence in the value of the Rf pa-
rameter is negligibly small, 1.3%. HS model gives larger
value of polydispersity (σ = 0.24) relative to that of
SFF model (σ = 0.22), the diﬀerence is 9%. HS model
gives smaller value of average radius, the diﬀerence in
radius value is 8%. Though HS model provides the ex-
act solution, the results of SFF model in the evaluation
of vesicle radius and polydispersity do not diﬀer more
than 10%. Important result is the same value of the
calculated membrane thickness d for both models. The
proposed SFF model for the evaluation of SANS spec-
tra from large unilamellar vesicles has a fundamental
advantage over the model of hollow sphere. In a frame-
work of hollow sphere model one can describe the in-
ner structure of the membrane only in terms of a sys-
tem of several inclusive concentric spheres, each having a
constant scattering length density [5,7]. The problem of
water distribution function inside the lipid membrane,
particularly in the region of polar head groups, is be-
ing widely discussed now. In ﬁrst approximation one can
use linear or exponential distribution of water from the
membrane surface further inside the bilayer. This kind
of water distribution will generate linear or exponential

and the macroscopic cross section can be written as

(q) = n · Fs(q, R) · Fb(q, d)

Eqs. (7)-(9) present a new model of separated form fac-
tors (SFF) of the large unilamellar vesicles. SFF model
has advantage relative to the HS model due to possibility
to describe the internal membrane structure via presen-
tation of ρ(x) as an any integrable function. The approx-
imation of neutron scattering length density across the
membrane with a constant ρ(x) ≡ ∆ρ is far from being
realistic [4,5,7], but gives possibility to make compar-
ison of HS and SFF models. In the approximation of
ρ(x) ≡ ∆ρ, (9) is integrated to the expression

Macroscopic cross sections for the calculations with HS model
are in absolute units. Macroscopic cross sections for the cal-
culations with SFF model are multiplied by 10

term in the function of scattering length density, which
is beyond the capability of the HS model, based only on
the strip-function distribution of scattering length den-
sity. The model of separated form factors introduced in
the present work is deprived of this imperfection, be-
cause any integrable analytical or numerical function
can be used as a function of scattering length density
(see. eq.9). Future investigation of the internal mem-
brane structure via application of SFF model can give
new interesting results for binary phospholipid/water,
ternary phospholipid/cryoprotector/water or phospho-
lipid/surfactant/water systems.

3 Conclusions

New model of separated form factors (SFF) is proposed
for large unilamellar vesicles. SFF model gives an oppor-
tunity to analyze vesicle geometry and internal mem-
brane structure separately. The validity of SFF model
was examined by comparison with hollow sphere (HS)
model for large unilamellar vesicles. Both models give
the same value of membrane thickness, the diﬀerence in
the value of vesicle average radius and vesicle polydisper-
sity is inside of 10% accuracy. SFF model is proposed as
prospective method of the internal membrane structure
evaluation from the SANS experiment on large unilamel-
lar vesicles.

We enumerate possible topologies of pseudoknots in single-stranded RNA molecules. We use a
steepest-descent approximation in the large N matrix ﬁeld theory, and a Feynman diagram formalism
to describe the resulting pseudoknot structure. A comparison with known pseudoknots is provided.

An RNA molecule is a heteropolymer strand made up
of four types of nucleotides, uracil (U ), adenine (A),
guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The sequence of these
nucleotides, or bases, makes up the molecule’s primary
structure. Bases form hydrogen bonds with each other
to give the molecule a stable shape in three dimensions,
with U bonding to A, and C to G. Calculating the shape
into which a given primary structure will fold is impor-
tant in molecular biology.

It is possible to write the partition function for a chain
of L bases in terms of the 3-space coordinates, ri, of each
base in the chain,

with the δ-function ensuring that the bases are separated
by a characteristic distance l. Here, ZL,1 is the contri-
bution to the partition function from hydrogen bonding
Uij with the energy
between nucleotides. We associate
of forming a bond between the ith and jth bases, and let
Vij = exp(Uij /T ) where T is the temperature. Then we
have

Thus, ZL,1 is the combinatorial heart of the RNA fold-
ing problem—when performing calculations to ﬁnd the
folded state, one can usually abstract away the spatial de-
tails represented by the integral over the ri’s [1]. While
ZL,1 appears very simple at ﬁrst glance, it contains a
term for every possible conﬁguration of bonds on the
chain. Finding the folded state could involve searching
through on the order of L! terms, which is a daunting
task for even the shortest RNAs.

Fortunately, in RNA, there is a hierarchical separation
between primary, secondary and tertiary structures that
reduces the number of conﬁgurations that must be con-
sidered. One can ﬁnd the secondary structure by draw-
ing the chain of nucleotides around the circumference of
a circle, with the ﬁrst nucleotide next to the last, and

ﬁnding a bond structure that minimizes the free energy
with the constraints that all bonds are drawn as arcs
within the circle, and no bonds cross. This planar con-
ﬁguration (in the sense used in [2, 3], though other usages
are common in the RNA folding literature) is made up of
the secondary structure’s characteristic loops and bulges.
Bonds between distinct parts of the secondary structure
are called pseudoknots, and are typically considered part
of the molecule’s tertiary structure. The formation of the
tertiary structure is believed not to alter the more stable
secondary structure [4, 5].

Secondary and tertiary structures are usually stable at
biological temperatures, which are typically well below
the RNA molecule’s melting point. This makes certain
very eﬃcient algorithms for determining RNA secondary
structure at zero temperature possible and useful. These
“dynamic programming” methods involve recursively cal-
culating ZL,1 and then backtracking to ﬁnd the dominant
terms, and thus determine which bonds are present in the
folded RNA. There are also dynamic programming tech-
niques that try to account for pseudoknots, but they are
necessarily slower[2, 6, 7].

The distinction between secondary and pseudoknot
structure has a topological ﬂavor. One powerful tool for
dealing with topological considerations is the large N ex-
pansion used in matrix ﬁeld theories. Originally proposed
by ’t Hooft to represent quantum chromodynamics with
N colors, it predicts that non-planar Feynman diagrams
have amplitudes proportional to negative powers of N ,
and are thus suppressed when N is large[3, 8]. Two of
the authors applied a similar technique to the problem
of RNA folding, leading to the same sort of suppression
of non-planar conﬁgurations; we summarize the results
below, and refer the reader to [1] for details.

One can perform a series of manipulations to ﬁnd that

above. Thus we can expand in powers of 1/N and evalu-

This equation is recursive, and we need to impose the
boundary condition that Gi,i+l = 0 for l
2 to solve
it. Then, Gij is the partition function of the secondary
structure of an isolated chain that starts with the ith base
and ends with the jth base. This form is precisely that
used in existing dynamic programming algorithms[2, 4,
6]. Since it carries two indices, Gij is analogous to the
quark propagator in large N QCD, which carries two
indices for color. The recursion relation ensures that it
is a “dressed” propagator.

We can then introduce the ﬂuctuation xij , deﬁned by
Aij = ˜Aij + xij /√N , and expand tr log(M −1(A)) and
M −1(A) as power series in x. Then we collect powers of
N −1/2 to ﬁnd corrections to the steepest descent approx-
imation of ZL,1. We are left with Gaussian integrals in
xij that can be evaluated by applying Wick’s theorem,
with contractions given by the inverse of the quadratic

form in the exponential. This inverse is a propagator
which satisﬁes the Bethe-Salpeter equation

The Hartree equation gave us the partition function for
a single contiguous chain of RNA interacting with itself,
while the Bethe-Salpeter relation represents the contribu-
tion from two separated segments that interact with each
other. Thus, ∆ij,kl is analogous to the gluon propagator
in large N QCD, which carries four color indices.

There are two ways of drawing Feynman diagrams for
these propagators. The ﬁrst was introduced in [1], and is
useful for visualizing the RNA’s topology. The second
is the double-line formalism of ’t Hooft, which makes
it very easy to ﬁnd a graph’s order in 1/N , by assign-
ing appropriate powers powers of N to loops, edges and
vertices[3, 8]. It follows from (9) that the ∆ propagator
contains powers of V 1/2
, but the partition function (2)
contains only whole powers of Vij . Thus, all ∆’s in the ex-
ij ∆ij,klV 1/2
pansion appear with factors of V 1/2
.
This is reﬂected in the diagrams in ﬁg. 1.

The angle brackets in (11) mean the included terms
should be integrated over xij with the Gaussian weight
(tr x2 + tr(M −1c)2)/2]. These integrals are sim-
exp[
ple in principle, as the xij ’s can be contracted with the
Bethe-Salpeter propagator (9). Each power of x intro-
duces a vertex for gluon lines.

The multiplication implicit in the deﬁnition of Bp is
matrix multiplication, so many indices must be summed
over when evaluating the terms in (11). For instance,
evaluating one of the contractions of

The Bm and Tn terms have simple ’t Hooft diagrams,
as shown in ﬁg. 3. The ellipses in the diagram represent
the string of m or n gluon vertices associated with those
terms. The graph for Tn closes on itself, reﬂecting the
trace’s cyclic symmetry.

These diagrams make it simple to pick out the Wick
contractions that actually contribute to ZL,1. One can
draw Feynman diagrams for the contractions of the 7
terms in (11), and ﬁnd that 25 of them are distinct (many
contractions are equivalent under the cyclic symmetry of
the traces Tn). However, most of these vanish, as they

contain closed G loops. Diagrams involving closed loops
will depend on a factor of Gi,i+l for l > 2, and therefore
vanish. This can also be understood in terms of the di-
agrams from [1], where G’s represent segments of RNA,
and ∆’s represent interactions between two segments. A
closed G loop with both ends connected to the same side
of a ∆ propagator describes a closed loop of RNA in-
teracting with the main strand. We have speciﬁcally ex-
cluded this possibility from our deﬁnition of ZL,1, so such
conﬁgurations must vanish. This is the reason why there
is no graph of order 1/N in (10).

As an example, consider

B3T3M −1
, which can be
i
h
contracted in the three distinct ways shown in ﬁgs. 4(a),
(b) and (c). Each of these occurs with a symmetry factor
of 3, since an xij from the B3 can be contracted with any
of the (cyclically equivalent) xml’s in T3. Only the dia-
gram in ﬁg. 4(a) can be traced with an unbroken line—
the other diagrams contain closed loops. Thus, only one
of the three sorts of contractions contributes to the par-
tition function.

When all the contractions have been carried out, there
remain 8 non-vanishing graphs, which are shown in ﬁg.
5. The contractions associated with each diagram are

function.

Since the pseudoknots we consider contribute to order
1/N 2, only one pseudoknot may be present at a time.
This problem can be solved by noting that all the pseu-
doknot diagrams are one particle irreducible (1PI, i.e.
they cannot be disconnected by opening a single quark
line), and can thus be resummed by a Dyson equation.
Deﬁne Σmn as the sum of all the amputated pseudoknot
diagrams deﬁned above (i.e. the sum of all O(N −2) 1PI
diagrams with their external G propagators removed).
Then the partition function Zmn satisﬁes the usual Dyson
equation:

Xm<k<l<n

Once the 8 diagrams for Σ have been calculated, the full
partition function (with any number of pseudoknots) can
be calculated using the above recursion relations.

Current dynamic programming methods involve calcu-
lating the partition function of an RNA strand directly,
using the recursion relation (8) and then “backtracking”
along it to ﬁnd the bonds that make the largest contribu-
tions. One can do this by ﬁnding the largest of the terms
on the right hand side of (8) and working backwards,
eﬀectively unraveling the structure bond by bond.

The strategy for computing the pseudoknots is thus
the following: i) solve for the Hartree partition function
(8), ii) solve the Bethe-Salpeter recursion equation (9) to
get ∆kl,mn, iii) calculate the eight amputated diagrams
of ﬁg. 5 making up the 1PI function Σmn, iv) solve the
Dyson equation (13) by recursion to obtain the full par-
tition function with any number of pseudoknots, v) and

Some numerical calculations are under way and we
hope to present those results in a future paper, along
with an explicit calculation for the order N −2 folding of
a short (L

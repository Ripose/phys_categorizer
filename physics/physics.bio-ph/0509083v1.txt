Abstract

We propose an elasticity theory for one and two dimensional arrays of globular proteins for which

the free energy is aﬀected by relative position and relative rotation between neighboring molecules.

The kinematics of such assemblies is described, the conditions of compatibility are found, a form

of the free energy is given, and formulas for applied forces and moments are developed.

It is

shown that fully relaxed states of sheets consist of helically deformed sheets which themselves are

composed of helical chains of molecules in rational directions.

We apply the theory to the fascinating contractile deformation that occurs in the tail sheath of

the virus bacteriophage T4, which aids its invasion of its bacterial host. Using electron density

maps of extended and contracted sheath, we approximate the domains of each molecule by ellipsoids

and then evaluate our formulas for the position and orientation of each molecule. We show that,

with the resulting kinematic description, the conﬁgurations of extended and contracted tail sheath

are generated by a simple formula. We proposed a constrained version of the theory based on

measurements on extended and contracted sheath. Following a suggestion of Pauling [Discussions

of the Faraday Society 13, 170-6 (1953)], we develop a simple model of the molecular interaction.

The resulting free energy is found to have a double-well structure. Certain simple deformations

are studied (tension, torsion inﬂation); the theory predicts a ﬁrst-order Poynting eﬀect and some

unexpected relations among moduli. Finally, the force of penetration is given, and a possibly

interesting program of epitaxial growth and patterning of such sheets is suggested.

INTRODUCTION

A remarkably large number of biological structures are composed of identical protein

molecules, or mixtures of a few diﬀerent protein molecules, in regular arrays. Examples are

microtubules, bacterial ﬂagella, F-actin ﬁlaments and viral coats. These are diﬀerent from

typical inorganic crystals in that the individual molecules are composed of many atoms

and the whole array is typically not a 3-D crystal but is often a single molecule thick

regular array on a sheet, either ﬂat, curved or polyhedral, or else in a linear chain. Often

the latter adopt helical forms, and, in the example below of bacteriophage T4 tail sheath,

the cylindrical sheath is composed of two families of helical chains of proteins. Besides

the reduced dimensionality and natural curvature, the protein-protein interactions involve

one or more bonding sites with groups of bonded atoms distributed over the bonding site.

Because of this, the interactions can be complex (from a ﬁrst principles’ viewpoint) and

proteins exert both forces and moments on each other. However, a simplifying feature of

the interactions is that individual protein molecules in such arrays predominantly interact

only with nearest neighbors.

With the rapid development of optical tweezers and atomic force microscopes [1],[2], it

has become possible to subject a protein structure to a force or moment and to measure

its elastic response. These experiments seem to be often interpreted in terms of classical

macroscopic theories of elasticity. For example, Kirchhoﬀ’s rod theory is often used to

interpret experiments on chains such as DNA [3], [4], [5]. As discussed by these authors,

Kirchhoﬀ’s rod theory is expected to be valid when the length of the chain is much larger

than its radius of curvature, and it has been used successfully in such cases. But Kirchhoﬀ’s

rod theory is built on certain assumptions relating to the macroscopic theory of nonlinear

elasticity. Thus, for example, in its simplest anisotropic form, three suitable bending-torsion

experiments suﬃce to determine the moduli, meaning that the mechanical behavior in all

subsequent experiments is then determined. In addition, with only a few molecules (138 in

the case of T4 tail sheath) or with localized large curvatures, a molecular elasticity theory

may be needed.

4

For these reasons we develop here an elasticity theory that is suitable for these protein

arrays. The proteins themselves have irregular yet well-deﬁned shapes and they interact

via localized bonding sites. We steer a course midway between detailed ﬁrst principles

calculations on the given protein sequence (which, at present, would leave us stuck on the

protein folding problem) and macroscopic nonlinear elasticity. First, each molecule is given

a position and orientation. We explain how position and orientation are related to detailed

structure, in a manner that is consistent with the results of ﬁrst principles calculations. Our

deﬁnition is diﬀerent from the usual one, but seems to have some advantages. It also has the

property that the position and orientation are given by a translation and rigid rotation of a

reference molecule that best approximates, in a least squares sense, the deformed molecule.

As for interactions, we focus on pairwise forces and moments, because bonding between

globular proteins is often localized at the region of contact between two proteins. Because

we have an orientation variable as well as a positional one, our theory also has points of

contact with the theory of liquid crystals, but in the end the theory is quite diﬀerent.

We propose a form of the free energy based on these ideas (Section III). Imposing the

condition of frame-indiﬀerence, we deﬁne certain “strain variables” upon which the free en-

ergy depends. Conditions of compatibility concern the extent to which these strain variables

can be assigned independently: for sheets, we ﬁnd that necessary and suﬃcient conditions

for compatibility (of a simply connected sheet, deﬁned precisely below) are that a certain

pair of sums of four terms vanishes. These relate to the process of checking compatibility

around elementary squares consisting of four molecules. We ﬁnd these conditions to be very

useful.

For both chains and sheets, helical conﬁgurations arise as the natural ordered structures.

In particular, under general conditions they are the free energy minimizers in the absence of

boundary conditions. These results can be considered as analytical expressions of the ideas

of Crane [8]. Ultimately the reason is the same reason that these conﬁgurations are natural

in nonlinear elasticity (Ericksen [9]). To oversimplify, in a helical conﬁguration any two parts

of the chain, of equal monomer length, are related by a Galilean transformation. Therefore,

the equilibrium of a short section implies, via rotation and translation, that the whole helix

is in equilibrium. In the present context they play a deeper role: fully relaxed states of a

sheet governed by our free energy consist of helically deformed sheets which themselves are

composed of helical chains of molecules (Section IX).

Using this theory, we study of deformations of the tail sheath of bacteriophage T4, Figure

1. Bacteriophages are viruses that attack bacteria. The T4 virus is composed of a capsid

containing the viral DNA (Figure 1a) and a tail shown extending down from the capsid.
The tail consists of a pair of concentric cylinders (Figure 1b) each about 1000 ˚A long. The
inner tail tube with a diameter of about 90 ˚A is surrounded by the tail sheath with an outer
diameter of about 240 ˚A. The sheath is composed of six parallel helices, made from chains

of a single type of protein. Although the tail sheath is single molecular layer protein sheet,

it should not be considered (as is assumed by nonlinear plate theory) thin relative to its

radius of curvature, this ratio being (thickness/mean radius of curvature)

1.

≈

Prior to invasion of the host, the sheath proteins are arranged as steeply pitched helices,

and the tail adopts so-called extended structure. During the virus’ attack on a bacterium,

the tail sheath changes shape dramatically; the protein helices compress, causing the sheath

to shorten and fatten into a more compact contracted structure. This drives the relatively

rigid inner tail tube through the cell wall, making a passage for the viral DNA to pass into

the host (Figure 1c). During this process the sheath contracts irreversibly to about 1/3 of

6

its original length accompanied by a 50% increase in outer diameter. The transformation

has many features in common with martensitic phase transformations, as has been noted by

Olson and Hartman [7]. For a general review of T4 tail structure and function see Coombs

and Arisaka. [10]

Once the viral DNA is inside the host, it reprograms the host cell to produce all ingredients

needed to form new viruses. The viral protein molecules produced by this process self-

assemble into virus progeny within the host, eventually causing it to burst, releasing the

viruses to infect other hosts.

We apply the theory of the protein sheet to the tail sheath of bacteriophage T4. Using

measured electron density maps of extended and contracted sheath [11], [12], we identify

three domains in each molecule and approximate these by ellipsoids. We then deﬁne the

structures of the two phases. We develop a simple formula that produces these structures

(57), and applies to any any model of the molecule, however complex. The simplicity of

this formula arises from the fact that, even though the molecule itself may be complex,

the relationship between diﬀerent molecules is very simple. Based on the experimentally

observed mode of deformation, we adopt a constrained theory for the sheath. The con-

straints are exactly satisﬁed by both extended and contracted sheath. The resulting theory

has surprising implications with regard to the response of the sheath to diﬀerent loadings,

including a strong ﬁrst-order Poynting eﬀect, unexpected relations between moduli, certain

combinations of applied axial force and moment that do no work on the sheath, and a cer-

tain relation between the force and moment needed to transform contracted to extended

sheath. Among these results, there are numerous possible points of comparison with future

small-scale quantitative experiments.

A very early model of helical contraction proposed by Pauling [13] provides a basis for

simplifying our free energy. Pauling envisioned that helices forming a cylinder could be

compressed to the point where adjacent turns of the helix would form bonds. This leads

to a simple model of interactions with one family of bonds guiding assembly and another

causing contraction. As higher resolution images of T4 tail sheath become available [11],

this remains likely the principal mechanism for sheath contraction. Guided by Pauling’s

mechanism, we build a simpliﬁed free energy for T4 tail sheath.

The deformation of T4 tail sheath is a particularly interesting case for the theory for

7

several reasons: 1) very large changes of shape in an organized protein structure take place

as a means of producing force, 2) the shape change has been identiﬁed as of martensitic

type, which suggests a multi-well elasticity theory, and 3) there is an interest in understand-

ing how this phase transformation relates to nonbiological martensitic transformations, and

in particular how the force and energy of contraction compare in the biological and non-

biological cases. The latter could suggest strategies for man-made analogs of the T4 tail

sheath. Finally, 4) a quantitative evaluation of the energy stored has interesting biological

signiﬁcance. That is, in bacteriophage T4, as in all viruses, there is no mechanism for the

production of energy. Thus, all the energy that is released upon contraction of the tail sheath

must be stored during the assembly phase of the virus, from apparently high free energy

molecules created during translation of the viral genome, aided by the energy consuming

translation mechanism of the bacterial host. For the purpose of storage of this energy, the

process of epitaxial stabilization, familiar from the growth of semiconductor compounds on

single crystal substrates, apparently plays an important role. Motivated by these ideas we

suggest such a program of epitaxy (Section 10).

II. KINEMATIC DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL PROTEIN MOLECULES,

CHAINS AND SHEETS

We are interested in chains and sheets consisting of protein molecules. For simplicity we

shall consider both structures to consist of identical molecules[30].

A molecule will be speciﬁed by a pair (y, R) consisting of a position vector y

the plane.

The usual way to deﬁne orientation of a molecule, or a collection of molecules, is to

take moments of the (time averaged) mass distribution (see, e.g., De Gennes, [14], Chapter

2), typically the second or fourth moment. Below, we suggest a diﬀerent deﬁnition of

orientation that seems to have advantages with regard to the connection with molecular

dynamics simulation.

Each molecule consists ν atoms of C, H and various other elements in a folded conﬁg-

uration. For each atom we assign a corresponding atomic mass mi , i = 1, . . . , ν. Near

physiological temperatures, the atoms in a protein molecule undergo rather large vibrations,

but it is still sensible to talk about time averaged position on macroscopic time scales and we

shall assign these average positions as y1, . . . , yν. Time averaged momentum has dynamical

signiﬁcance, so we use it to deﬁne the position of a molecule. We will take its position to be

its mass averaged position,

y =

Σν
i=1mi yi
Σν
i=1mi

.

(3)

From the same information we can also obtain a measure of the orientation of a molecule.

That is, we consider a molecule in standard position deﬁned by ﬁxed atomic positions

x1, . . . , xν. This standard position could for example be the collection of positions in a

crystallized form of the molecule, deduced from x-ray crystallography, or from theoretical

studies of the conﬁguration of single molecules in solution. From these reference positions

9

(8)

we deﬁne the mass averaged reference position as above,

x =

Σν
i=1mi xi
Σν
i=1mi

.

A natural concept of orientation is obtained through the average deformation gradient of

the molecule, deﬁned in the following way,

Here, r can be taken as a typical radius of the reference molecule, e.g.,

(The position and orientation of a molecule will turn out to be independent of r). The

expression (5) for F is dimensionless and translation invariant. Typically, it will be true

that det F > 0, which we assume. If the yi represent a rigid deformation of the reference

molecule, i.e., yi = Qxi + c, i =

and deﬁne R in this decomposition as the orientation. For molecules that deform as well as

rotate and translate, R is still a natural measure of orientation.

These deﬁnitions of position and orientation, the latter deﬁned by a polar decomposition

of the apparently complicated formula for F, have several attractive features. First, we

observe that both F and y are linear functions of the positions y1, . . . yν. We have framed

the deﬁnitions in this way so that their second time derivatives are immediately related to

(time averaged) forces via the equations of molecular dynamics. Second, there is a useful

deﬁned by (3) and (5),(9). The proof of this fact is straightforward. First, by diﬀerentiating

The orientation R can be obtained from the formula R = FU−

square root being the unique positive-deﬁnite square root. For the purpose of a constrained

molecular dynamic simulation (with given R) it is useful to have a linear constraint. A

necessary[32] condition that R is related to F by (9) is that Skew(RFT ) = 0, that is,

Skew (R (Σν

(12)

which is a linear constraint on the yi.

In summary, our basic kinematics of a molecule is speciﬁed by a pair (y, R) deﬁned by

(3) and (5),(8),(9). We wish to emphasize again that this choice of kinematics does not

entail assumptions of rigidity of molecules. These formulas do allow one to determine our

kinematic variables from unrestricted ﬁrst principles calculations.

We note that there are more complicated theories possible with this general type of

kinematics. A further possible generalization would be that the free energy is aﬀected by

position and and full deformation gradient of molecules deﬁned by (5).

11

III. FREE ENERGY

Although all atoms have inﬁnite range, each protein molecule interacts primarily with

its close neighbors and we shall develop the theory on this basis. Because bonding sites are

often localized and interlocking, molecules are expected to exert both forces and moments

on neighboring molecules.

We base the theory on a formula for the free energy. We make two simplifying assumptions

which easily could be generalized: 1) the molecules are identical (Thus we can use the

reference conﬁguration introduced in Section II for all molecules), and 2) we only consider

nearest neighbor interactions. For chains, the “nearest neighbor” of i

2 for i = 1 and N

1 for i = N. For sheets there are various possibilities. One can have

−

triangular lattices with each molecule bonded to 6 nearest neighbors or rectangular lattices

with each molecule having 4 nearest neighbors or more complicated situations. In the case

of 4 nearest neighbors the nearest neighbors of (i, j) consist of all molecules of the form

(i + 1, j), (i

1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j

1) that lie in

. If not all four of these are in

we call

−

−

D

D

(i, j) a boundary molecule; otherwise, we call it an interior molecule. Here we write the free

energy only in the case of 4 nearest neighbors, the generalizations being automatic.

Since such protein arrays are of interest in solution, the assumptions are somewhat diﬀer-

ent than would be appropriate for atoms in a polymeric chain or a crystal. In particular the

“free energy” will be taken as the free energy of the protein assembly and a ﬁxed volume V

of the surrounding solution. This is appropriate to the case that V is surrounded by a large

bath B having ﬁxed temperature and ﬁxed chemical potentials of species in solution. All

free energies below will depend on the temperature and chemical potentials, but since these

will be ﬁxed throughout this paper, we will leave these parameters out of the notation. As

is well-known the presence of the solution profoundly aﬀects the free energy of the protein

through osmotic eﬀects, but it also aﬀects the form of the free energy. In particular, bound-

ary molecules may have a free energy that is diﬀerent from interior molecules, because one

or more of their bonding sites is unbonded and exposed directly to the solution.

In this simplest situation we will assume that, for chains, there is a molecular interaction

free energy which depends on the position and orientation of a pair of molecules ψ(a, R, b, Q)

12

deﬁned for a, b

R3 and R, Q

∈

∈

SO(3).

In order to accommodate the possibility of

boundary eﬀects, we distinguish the free energy contribution from the interaction of the

ﬁrst and second molecules, ψ1(a, R, b, Q) and the next to last and last ones, ψN (a, R, b, Q).

The total free energy is then,

Ψ(y1, R1 , . . . , yN , RN ) =

ψ(yi, Ri, yi+1, Ri+1)

(13)

+ ψ1(y1, R1, y2, R2) + ψN (yN

1, RN

1, yN , RN )

−

−

The pairwise form of this free energy is justiﬁed by the presence of localized bonding sites.

While it would seem like the molecular free energies ψ1 and ψN could be quite diﬀerent from

each other and from ψ, in fact this is not true within the present context. To see this, consider

a chain

1, . . . , M, M + 1, . . . , N

and translate uniformly the molecules

M + 1, . . . , N

.

}
Physically, if this translation is large, this should give the sum of the energies of two separate

{

}

{

chains. If one writes this out for an arbitrary conﬁguration, one ﬁnds that, in fact, ψ1 =

ψN = ψ, so the preceding energy is in fact,

=

ψ(yi, Ri, yi+1, Ri+1).

The main physical assumption embodied here is that the contribution to the free energy from

a pair of molecules is unaﬀected by the positions and orientations of all other molecules in

the chain, in keeping with the idea that the main free energy changes are due to changes in

conformation at the bonding site between a pair of molecules.

For sheets the assumptions are analogous. In this case there are 15 diﬀerent kinds of

boundary molecules, depending on which of the four bonds is missing. To simplify the

notation we let

be the set of boundary molecules and write the total free energy as

(15)

where ψBi,j is a free energy for the boundary molecules. Each ψBi,j is one of the 15 functions

describing the free energy of interaction of boundary molecules with dependence on the

13

position and orientation of neighbors that are present. In writing this free energy, we have

eﬀectively assumed that all bonding sites of between molecules i, j and i, j + 1 are the same,

independent of i and j, and the same for sites of the form i, j and i + 1, j. Also, in many

interesting cases not all of the 15 kinds of boundary molecules are represented. For example,

in isolated T4 tail sheath as usually pictured, there at only two kinds of boundary molecules.

The condition of frame-indiﬀerence restricts the form of the molecular free energies. We

note ﬁrst that, according to the deﬁnitions (3) and (9), the quantities y1 and R1 are trans-

formed into Ry1 + c and RR1 under a superimposed rigid body motion Ryi + c of all

the atoms. Thus, in the case of chains, the condition of frame-indiﬀerence is (for interior

molecules)

ψ(y1, R1, y2, R2) = ψ(Ry1 + c, RR1, Ry2 + c, RR2),

(16)

which must hold independently for R, R1, R2 ∈

IV. COMPATIBILITY

Compatibility concerns the extent to which one can prescribe the quantities describing

strain, or, more generally, the functions on which the free energy depends after the condition

of frame-indiﬀerence has been imposed. In our case this concerns the extent to which we

can assign the relative translations and relative orientations.

14

In the case of chains we therefore assign (t1, Q1, . . . , tN

conditions are solvable, and all solutions are related to each other by exact rigid motions of

the entire molecule. Hence, the problem of compatibility for chains is analogous to the case

of 1-D rod theories in continuum mechanics: there are no conditions of compatibility and

the freedom is precisely overall rigid deformations.

For sheets there are nontrivial restrictions of compatibility, as expected based on con-

tinuum shell theories. We begin by considering the case of 4 bonding directions. For the

analysis below a path is a succession of nearest neighbors in

and a loop is a closed path.

Immediately we see that there are some restrictions. For example, if Ri,j has been deter-

mined, then by successive application of (19)2,4 there are overdetermined equations for, say,

Ri+1,j+1, these being,

Equating these, we get

Ri+1,j+1 = Ri,j+1Qi,j+1 = Ri,j ˆQi,jQi,j+1

Ri+1,j+1 = Ri+1,j ˆQi+1,j = Ri,jQi,j ˆQi+1,j.

(22)

This has the following interpretation: as we go say clockwise around a unit square in
the lattice Z2, the product of the Q’s (taken with transpose if the path goes to the left

or down) is the identity. Two neighboring squares, both traversed clockwise, give such

squares. By induction and using the discrete simple connectedness[33] of

, this extends to

D

any non-self-intersecting closed loop in

Z2.

D ∩

So far, the argument concerns the solution of the last two equations of (19). For the

translations, by again traversing a unit square in the clockwise sense, we have from (19)1,3
that Ri,jˆti,j + Ri,j+1ti,j+1 −
Ri,jti,j = 0, which, after premultiplication by RT
i,j
gives

Ri+1,jˆti+1,j −

ˆti,j + ˆQi,jti,j+1 −

Qi,jˆti+1,j −

ti,j = 0.

(23)

As above, equations of this form for neighboring squares can be combined to an equation of

compatibility for a rectangle and then, by iteration, to a non-self-intersecting closed loop.

By this time it is clear that the pattern of argument is essentially the same as that for

diﬀerentials (i.e., this kind of argument does not really use that the diﬀerentials are small,

if only nearest neighbors interactions are considered). That is, necessary and suﬃcient

conditions for (18) to be compatible are that the compatibility conditions for unit squares

i,j = I,

ˆti,j + ˆQi,jti,j+1 −

Qi,jˆti+1,j −

(24)

are satisﬁed. The necessity of these conditions has been proved above. The suﬃciency
follows by giving arbitrarily y0,0 ∈
that (0, 0) is in
D

R3, R0,0 ∈
. Then, for any other (k, m)

SO(3), assuming without loss of generality

, we consider a path from (0, 0) to

∈ D \ B

(k, m). Successive application of (19) determines ﬁrst Rk,m and then yk,m, and every such

R, y along this path. By a process of exhaustion, i.e., construct a path which does not

cross itself or any other path to a point whose values R, y have not been determined from

16

a previously determined one, we then determine all values Ri,j, yi,j. These satisfy all of the

equations (19). That is, by construction, a point (i, j) and neighbor (i+1, j) (resp., (i, j +1))

are each connected to (0, 0) by a path used in the construction. These paths may coincide

over some initial length, but, once they depart from each other, they never intersect. Thus,

by possibly shortening the loop, we can without loss of generality assume the paths form

a non-self-intersecting loop with a single link removed. Satisfaction of (19) then holds as a

consequence of the compatibility condition for such loops.

There is clearly also uniqueness of the construction of Ri,j, yi,j up to the choice of

R0,0, y0,0, which, by the frame-indiﬀerence of the quantities Q, t is equivalent to unique-

ness up to overall rigid deformation.

Suppose now we add additional bonding directions. Since the equations (24) are both

necessary and suﬃcient for the existence of the positions and orientations, and these positions

and orientations are uniquely determined up to overall translation and rotation (which does

not aﬀect the (t, Q)’s), then all values of (t, Q) corresponding to other bonding directions
are uniquely determined by (ti,j, Qi,j), (ˆti,j, ˆQi,j). One can write formulas for these. For

example, if (as in T4 sheath) we have the additional bonding directions (i, j)

In summary, with additional bonding directions, necessary and suﬃcient conditions for com-

patibility are (24), together with the formulas of the type (25) that uniquely determine the
values of (t, Q) for these additional directions in terms of (ti,j, Qi,j), (ˆti,j, ˆQi,j).

V. HELICAL CONFIGURATIONS

As shown in Figure 4 below, the tail sheath of bacteriophage T4 is a sheet consisting of

the union of two families of helices. Helical structures arise often in biology and they also

have special position within the context of the present theory, as we explain in this and the

following sections.

From a purely geometric viewpoint H. R. Crane in 1950 [8] argued that if two proteins

have complementary bonding sites and molecules bond at a speciﬁc angle, then chains of

17

these molecules are likely to from helices. In nonlinear elasticity of rods and plates, helical

conﬁgurations also arise in a natural way (Chouaieb and Maddocks, Moakher, Maher and

Maddocks, [4], [5]), and in 3-D nonlinear elasticity there are deep connections between the

existence of helical conﬁgurations in equilibrium, invariance and Noether’s theorem (Ericksen

[9]). In all of these arguments the frame-indiﬀerence of the free energy plays a central role,

allowing the variables describing strain to be either constant (in rod theory) or else to depend

on fewer reference coordinates for these special conﬁgurations.

We begin with chains and recall from (17) that the molecular free energy depends on

relative translation and orientation (t, Q). Motivated by the examples just cited we ﬁrst

try to ﬁgure out what are all conﬁgurations (y1, R1 , . . . , yN , RN ) having constant values of

(t, Q). In the following section we explain the energetic signiﬁcance of this choice, beyond

the obvious fact that such conﬁgurations have the property that the molecular free energy

is independent of the molecule. This problem is immediately solved by the considerations

of compatibility of the preceding section; we have to solve

and the general solution is,

SO(3) also corresponds to an arbitrary superimposed rigid deformation of the whole array.

The positions of the molecules described by the equations (27) lie on a helix. To see this

put R1 = I and note that Q = I corresponds to the degenerate case of a molecules spaced

equally along a line all with the same orientation. So we assume henceforth that Q

= I.

Then Q has an axial vector, that is, a vector e

Choosing the arbitrary translation y1 = r (to put the origin on the axis of the helix) and

eliminating the sum in (28) using (29) we have,

which, accounting for the conditions r

e = 0 and Qe = e, is the equation of a helix. The

orientations Ri of these helical conﬁgurations also vary in a regular way along the helix in

a manner given by (27) and illustrated, for example, in Figure 5.

The basic geometric information, like formulas for the pitch and radius of the helix in

terms of the given information (t, Q), can be read oﬀ from the formulas given in the preceding

paragraph. In particular, if ν

1 is the smallest number such that Qν = I, then the pitch

is ν

Below, we will observe that the relaxed conﬁgurations of extended or contracted T4 tail

can be viewed as a collection of 6 helices, each with 24 molecules. To evaluate the positions

and orientations of all these molecules from experimental data, it will be useful to understand

how the orientations of the molecules on a helix can be varied independently from the shape

of the helix. This is not immediately obvious from the formulas (27), but is easy to work

out. First it is clear geometrically (and it can be shown from the formulas above) that if the

shape of the helix is given, i.e., all of the yi, then assignment of the orientation of one of the

molecules on the helix determines the orientations of all the others. Thus there is expected

to be one free rotation matrix R to deﬁne this orientation. Given a helical conﬁguration

deﬁned by (y1, R1, Q, t), then all other helical conﬁgurations with the same positions are

given by

(y1, R1R, RT QR, RT t), R

SO(3).

∈

(31)

To use this formula, one can think of beginning with a helix of the desired shape and then

choosing R

SO(3) so that R1R is the desired orientation of molecule 1 and all the others

∈

19

then follow.

For sheets there are similar kinds of helical conﬁgurations, having the shape of a ribbon

bent and twisted into a helix. These are discussed below in Sections VII and IX.

VI. EQUILIBRIUM, FORCES AND MOMENTS

In this section we work out completely the equilibrium conditions for chains.

We shall repeatedly have to take a derivative of functions with respect to a rotation

matrix, so we ﬁrst brieﬂy explain the meaning of that here. (It is well-known how to deal

with the fact that rotation matrices lie on the manifold SO(3) and therefore their components

arbitrary skew matrix W =

cannot be varied independently, but we need to explain the notation). Recall that for an
2s2W2 + . . . (i.e., the quantity sW
substituted formally into the exponential series) converges for all s and yields a rotation

WT the series I + sW + 1

matrix. For a smooth function f (R) deﬁned on SO(3) we extend f smoothly outside SO(3)

in any way, and consider

We suppose that the chain is loaded at its ends by generalized forces f1, fN conjugate to

According to general principles, the ﬁrst variation of the total free energy with respect to

rigid translations is the balance of forces and its ﬁrst variation with respect to rigid rotations

is the balance of moments. The former, i.e., the derivative of (35) with respect to s at s = 0

of a variation yi(s) = yi + sc, for arbitrary choices of c, yields, by the frame-indiﬀerence of

the quantities t, Q,

f1 + fN = 0,

indicating, as expected, that f1 and fN are interpretable as simple applied forces. Similarly,

the ﬁrst variation yi(s) = (I + sW + . . . )yi, Ri(s) = (I + sW + . . . )Ri with W =

independent of i yields, using the arbitrariness of W and the formulas (32)-(34),

where (in the notation of (33))

−

−

Clearly, (37) is a balance of moments and m1, mN are pure moments applied to molecules 1

and N, these being related by the somewhat nonobvious formulas to the generalized “forces”

M1, MN .

Having established these interpretations we now take a general ﬁrst variation of the total

free energy, yi(s) = yi + sui, Ri(s) = (I + sWi + . . . )Ri, where now the positions and

orientations of molecules are varied independently. The previous variations being perfectly

legitimate, we may as well assume that the generalized forces satisfy (36) and (37), in which

case we write the total free energy as,

Appendix.

For boundary molecules we have

fN + m1,2 + mN = 0,

mN

1,N + mN = 0.

−

From these equations we interpret mℓ,ℓ+1 as the moment on molecule ℓ + 1 produced by

molecule ℓ, and Rℓ ∂ϕ(tℓ, Qℓ)/∂t as the force on molecule ℓ exerted by molecule ℓ + 1, and,

even though the latter is the force on molecule ℓ, we should interpret this force as acting at

the center of mass of molecule ℓ + 1.

Helical conﬁgurations have a special status with regard to the interior equilibrium equa-

tions. Recall that these conﬁgurations are deﬁned by saying that the relative translation

and orientation are independent of the molecule, and they are characterized by (26) and

(27). Let (t, Q) be the given relative translation and orientation associated with a helical

conﬁguration. It follows from the ﬁrst of (41) that RT

i fN is independent of i and then, using

the ﬁrst of (27), that RT

1 fN is on the axis of Q:

Qc = c, where c = RT

1 fN .

(44)

From the results of Section V R1c is the axis of the helical chain. Thus, (44) has the

interpretation that helical conﬁgurations are consistent with axial forces only. One can think

of this physically in the following way: given an applied force fN , the overall rotation R1

will adjust itself to make the force axial. It then follows that the N

3 interior equilibrium

−

equations (41)1 collapse to the single vector equation

Now we turn to the second equilibrium equation (41)2 for the moments. Using (42) and

(44), we get that the N

Note that the c-component of the latter is an identity, so (46) comprises eﬀectively two

equations which relate the applied force to the projection of the moment on the plane

perpendicular to c. The R1c-component of (41)2 requires (

(47)

Mathematically, we can view the equation (44) in the following way. Given the applied

force fN , the magnitude of c is determined by c = RT

1 fN . Then, the unknown Q determines
the direction of c as well as R1, up to an arbitrary axial rotation. In addition, we have

freedom to prescribe the applied axial moment RT

c. We then recognize that the

1 mN ·

equilibrium equations (45), (46) and (47) comprise 6 equations for the determination of

the 6 unknowns (t, Q). Depending on the convexity properties of ϕ, these are expected to

determine (t, Q), but we do not explore this here.

VII. BACTERIOPHAGE T4 TAIL SHEATH

In this section we specialize the formulas given above to T4 tail sheath. The ﬁrst task is to

describe the sheath in its extended and contracted conﬁgurations and identify the positions

and orientations using experimental measurements.

T4 tail sheath can be viewed as a protein sheet as deﬁned above. We can think of a

cylinder oriented vertically. The lowest annulus of the cylinder is a circle of 6 molecules. Each

of these 6 molecules generates a right handed helical chain consisting of 23 molecules [34].

Hence, we will identify the molecules accordingly, (yi,j, Ri,j),

i = 1, . . . , 6, j = 1, . . . , 23.

We work in the usual orthonormal basis (e1, e2, e3) and without loss of generality we will

choose the overall rotation and translation so that the axes of all the helices coincide with e3

and the ﬁrst annulus lies in the e1, e2 plane. The ﬁrst annulus is a circle (i.e., a degenerate

helical chain). According the results in Section V, this case corresponds to the case where

t = t0 is perpendicular to the axis of Q and a little calculation shows that without loss of

23

generality (by suitably rotating the six molecules about the e3 axis) we can assume,

t0 = (

−

ρ, 0, 0), Qθ = 

(48)

ρ > 0, and the fact that the 6 molecules are equally spaced on the helix gives Q6

⇒
θ = π/3. Without loss of generality we write y1 = ρ(1/2, √3/2, 0). The radius of the circle

θ = I =

of positions is ρ.

Emanating from each of these six molecules is a helical chain whose ﬁrst molecule has

now a given position and orientation. According to results of Section V, we need to specify

(t, Q) for each of these chains.

In fact all of these chains have the same (t, Q) because

suitable rigid rotations and translations bring them into coincidence with each other: the

whole conﬁguration of the tail sheath has 6-fold symmetry. The axis of Q is again e3 so

Q has the form (48)2, Q = Qγ. Thus, besides the radius ρ of the cylinder, we need to

determine the four parameters

γ and t = (τ1, τ2, λ).

(49)

For this purpose we ﬁrst show that τ1, τ2 are determined by ρ and γ. Referring to Section
V and using that the initial point is y1 = ρ(1/2, √3/2, 0), we have from the equations

t = tk + t⊥, (Q

I)r = t⊥, r = y1 that (Q

I)y1 = t⊥, from which τ1, τ2 are given by

in terms of ρ and γ. It remains to determine ρ, λ, and γ. The values of these depend on

whether we consider extended or contracted sheath.

A. Extended tail sheath

Extended sheath has an interesting geometric property that we term the 8/3 rule. The

rule is that the 8th molecule along one of these helices, beginning at a molecule on the

ﬁrst annulus, lies directly over the third molecule away counterclockwise along the annulus,

Figure 2. (The justiﬁcation of this rule from measured data of Leiman et al.

[11] is given

24

FIG. 2: Illustration of the 8/3 rule of extended sheath. Left: the ﬁrst 8 molecules (i = 1, j =

1, . . . , 8) on the main helix, viewed down the axis of the cylinder. Right: the ﬁrst 3 molecules

(i = 1, 2, 3, j = 1) on the ﬁrst annulus, again viewed down the axis. The slight touching of

domains of neighboring molecules on the right picture is an artifact of the ellipsoidal approximation;

in reality these do not touch.

(51)

This statement and the helical structure of the tail imply full periodicity, y(i,j+7) ·

e1,2 =

e1,2 whenever these are deﬁned. With regard to the present theory, all the good

y(i+2,j) ·
properties of helical conﬁgurations discussed above (and below) would hold without this

“accidental” periodicity. This suggests that its presence is perhaps related to something

other than the function of the tail, possibly its self-assembly via annulus-by-annulus epitaxial

growth. In this regard, if one omits the last annulus, then the rest of the tail is exactly 1

period. In other words, without omissions, the 22rd annulus lies directly over the 1st annulus.

It will be seen below that this 8/3 rule also applies to the orientation, R(1,8) = R(3,1). This

is of course the smallest period exhibited by the tail sheath. Possibly these facts are related

to process by which the tail tube directs the growth of the tail sheath, which is assembled

in the extended form (Below, the contracted form will not have this or a shorter period).

The two equations (51) give apparently two restrictions on the remaining parameters

In fact this condition only involves γ and is equivalent to the pair of equations

√3 sin 7γ = 0, √3 cos 7γ + sin 7γ = 0.

(53)

These equations have simultaneous roots at γ = 2π/21 + 2π n/7 where n is an integer. The

root of interest (i.e., corresponding to a fraction of a turn in the counter clockwise sense) is

γ = 2π/21. From the form of t it can now be seen that 21 λ is the pitch of the helices.

It remains to prescribe the orientations of all the molecules. As explained in the few lines

preceding (31) this is assignable independently of the positions. Since we have put R1 = I,

we may give this by giving the orientation of molecule (1, 1), from which all the orientations

of all the molecules are determined. In summary, the following information is needed from

experiment for extended and contracted tail sheath:

The orientation of molecule (1,1) = R1,1 ;

•

26

The radius of the cylinder of centers of masses = ρ ;

•

•

The pitch of the helices = 21 λ .

We obtained these from electron density maps of Leiman et al.

[12] (We are grateful to

Petr Leiman for the prepublication data on extended sheath, without which the present

theory would be incomplete). See Appendix B for how this data was used to represent the

molecules. Brieﬂy, this data does not give atom positions, but gives an excellent picture of

relatively rigid collections of atoms called domains. Both extended and contracted sheath

consist of three such domains. We assumed charge neutrality and computed centers of mass

of domains, then used the formulas (3), (5), and (9) to compute the position and orientation.

Three issues should be noted: 1) with three domains F is singular with rank equal to two;

nevertheless, R is uniquely determined by (9). 2) This data was rotated about the axis
of the helix and translated into the position of molecule (1,1) ). This gives, ρ = 73.75 ˚A,
λ = 40.6 ˚A. We chose extended sheath to be the reference conﬁguration so that R1,1 = I. For

contracted sheath R1,1 is given by (56) below. 3) Note from Figure 3 that masses of domains

are not conserved. This is a consequence of the ﬂexibility of certain bonds, which causes

some mass to be lost by the averaging procedure inherent in any 3D reconstruction. To give

deﬁnite results we ignored this problem and used the measured masses of each domain.

B. Contracted tail sheath

For contracted tail sheath the evaluation is completely analogous to the above except

that the 8/3 rule is replaced by a 12/1 rule,

e1 = y1,1 ·

the data given above are shown in Figure 4. The method of visualization is to approximate

the domains of the molecules of extended and contracted sheath by ellipsoids, centered at

the centers of mass of the domains, as described in detail in the Appendix B. As can be

seen there, this is quite an accurate representation of the molecule. Then we applied the

formulas (57) to this collection [35].

There is a substantial screw action that occurs when the sheath fully contracts. This can

be seen from Figure 5 which shows the corresponding main right handed helices in extended

and contracted sheath. If the baseplate is held ﬁxed during contraction, the neck experiences

almost a full turn, the angle change being about 343 degrees.

We should add that the data of Leiman et al.

[11] also provides a direct measure of

the validity of the 8/3 and 12/1 rules, which we have used above to evaluate γ = 2π/21 =

17.14◦ and γ = 2π/11 = 32.73◦, respectively. The direct measurement of Leiman et al. gives

the very nearby values γ = 17.2◦, 32.9◦.

SHEATH

A. Constraints

Our general expression for the free energy (15) of a protein sheet can be quite complicated,

and in our case is made more complicated by the presence of additional bonding directions,

as we explain below. In this section we use the known conﬁgurations of the sheath to make

simplifying assumptions that allow us to arrive at a manageable form of the energy.

First we note that each molecule in the sheath undergoes a substantial motion. Never-

theless, there are some simplifying features of this motion. These features are remarkably

close to the ideas of Pauling [13], who, prior to any knowledge of T4 tail sheath, theorized

that arrays of the helices of Crane could contract by having adjacent turns of the helix

form bonds. Later, in his study of T4 tail sheath, Moody [15] observed that bonds on the

right-handed helix remained to some extent invariant during contraction. He noticed that,

30

on the main helix, while there is a substantial relative rotation of molecules, the distance

between neighbors does not change too much. This concerns[36] neighboring molecules of

the form (i, j), (i, j + 1), shown e.g. for i = 1 in Figure 5. According to our equation (57) we

have for both extended and contracted sheath that this distance is

When this is evaluated for extended and contracted sheath using the data above we get,

to the relative importance of the bonding of inner domains, which appear to be in contact

for extended sheath,

(59)

In view of its physical interpretation, we assume (59) represents a special stiﬀness in T4 tail

sheath and we adopt it as a constraint for all values of λ and γ. Below we generalize it to

distorted conﬁgurations.

The constraint (59) has an interesting consequence. To describe this, we ﬁrst recall that

according to macroscopic nonlinear elasticity, a uniformly twisted cylinder subject to zero

axial force and free sides changes its diameter and also its length. The latter is referred to as

the Poynting eﬀect. It is generically a second order eﬀect: the elongation goes as the square

of the angle of twist of the cylinder; the elongation can be either positive or negative and

it is typically positive (lengthening) for elastomeric materials. For uniform states of T4 tail

sheath, that is, states given by the formula (57) subject to the constraint (59), we have a

very strong ﬁrst-order Poynting eﬀect. That’s because, by (57), the the end angle measured

from the extended conﬁguration is 22γ while the height is 22λ.

FIG. 7: Left pair: the ﬁrst annulus (i = 1, . . . , 6, j = 1) of extended and contracted sheath viewed

its center of mass. Right pair: the ﬁrst three molecules on the main helix (i = 1, j = 1, 2, 3) of

extended and contracted sheath viewed parallel to the axis of rotation (shown as the black dot)

The predicted height vs. twist relation is shown in Figure 6. This is essentially a plot

of the constraint (59). We note that if the approximation cos γ

(1/2)γ2 is not made,

1

≈

−

then, on the scale of Figure 6, the resulting graph is indistinguishable from Figure 6. Note

the dramatic Poynting eﬀect, particularly at contracted sheath. It would be interesting to

look at this relationship experimentally.

There is another simplifying feature of the deformation of T4 tail sheath that concerns

the orientation. For molecule (1, 1) the rotation that maps extended to contracted sheath is

given in (56), and its axis is given by

(0.001, 0.875, 0.485).

(60)

The angle of rotation is close to 64.8◦. Remarkably, the axis of rotation (60) is within about

1◦ of (0, √3/2, 1/2). A possible reason for this rotation and its implications become clear

when we superimpose the rotation axis (black line) on pictures of molecule (1, 1) of extended

and contracted tail sheath, Figure 7. From these pictures, if one thinks of the molecules

as having the shape of a kind of twisted banana, then evidently the axis of rotation passes

through its axis. Thus, the rotation of molecules of tail sheath seems largely constrained by

steric hindrance. But there is another feature of this rotation that is suggested by the two

pictures on the right of Figure 7. In these two pictures we are looking directly down the axis

of rotation. One can see that the rotation of (1, 1) of about 60◦ is causing it to align itself

approximately with the main helix. As above, this is consistent with the idea that there are

32

strong bonds linking molecules on this helix that not only constrain lengths but also relative

rotations. In fact, even though the molecules depicted at the right of Figure 7 do not touch,

there are strong bonds that link the innermost domains.

We now develop this idea quantitatively. To account for the evidence for steric hindrance,

we assume that the orientation R1,1 has the ﬁxed axis which we take to be (0, √3/2, 1/2),

but we allow the angle of rotation to be free for the moment, i.e.,

It is natural to use this constraint to solve for θ, eﬀectively making the orientation of each

molecule slave to the variables that describe the spatial positions of the sheath. This is always

possible for a wide range of reasonable values of γ, ρ, λ satisfying the earlier constraint (59).

Some care has to be exercised with uniqueness, since generically (62) has a pair of solutions

θ; however, only one of these lies in a modestly expanded interval containing [0, 64.8◦].

For uniform states, i.e., conﬁgurations obtainable using the formula (57), the constraints

(59) and (62) reduce the energy to a function of the kinematic variables ρ and γ, eﬀectively,

radius and twist. It would be natural now to write the energy as a double-well energy in

ρ, γ, with wells appropriate to contracted and extended sheath. However, it is advantageous

to consider also distorted states, so that process of transformation can be described.

33

B. Nonuniform states

To describe nonuniform states, we ﬁrst notice that our basic formula (57) is still useful. In

fact, this formula can be used to describe an arbitrarily distorted sheath, by simply allowing

ρ, γ, λ, R1,1 to depend on (i, j). To see this, we notice that if the molecule (i, j) occupies a

certain position and has a certain orientation, then one can always ﬁnd a helical cylinder

with molecule (i, j) in the given position and with the given orientation. Eﬀectively, the

formula (57) with variables ρ, γ, λ deﬁnes certain helical coordinate system based on the

structure of T4 sheath. We note that this generalization changes somewhat the geometric

interpretations given above of the variables ρ, γ, λ, R1,1.

In a setting of this generality, one could make a reasonable extrapolation of what should be

the constraints, based on the stiﬀnesses of the main helix discussed above, but the resulting

276 degrees of freedom would still be rather large; once the energy of T4 sheath becomes

known quantitatively, it will then be worthwhile doing something like this, since general

conﬁgurations and forces could be then computed using standard nonlinear optimization

techniques. For the present, we make a 1-D ansatz that positions and orientations are the

same on each annulus, that is,

(yi,j, Ri,j) is given by (57) with ρ = ρj, γ = γj, λ = λj, R1,1 = Rj,

i = 1, . . . , 6, j = 1, . . . , 23.

(63)

Our ﬁrst goal is to reformulate the constraints in terms of these variables. We begin with

the ﬁrst constraint (59).

If we calculate

RT

using (63) we see that

it depends in a somewhat complicated way on j, but we can also see from the expressions

that there is a natural change of variables that restores the simplicity of the expressions for

uniform states. That change of variables is:

¯γj = j(γj+1 −

γj) + γj,

¯λj = j(λj+1 −

Now we generalize the constraints (61), (62) on the orientation. First, we recall that our

way of writing the formula (57) automatically adjusts the orientation of each molecule on

the sheath in a consistent way (preserving the helices) in response to a change of R1,1. Since

we assumed above that R1,1 has the same axis for extended and contracted sheath, then we

assume this remains true for nonuniform states and R1,1 continues to have the form (61)

Once again, the change of variables (64) proves to be extremely useful, for if we now

(69)

(cid:17)

We again view this as a way to determine θj, j = 1, . . . , 22, making the orientation slave to

the other variables.

In summary, there is a natural expression of the constraints within the context of the

1-D ansatz, this being (67)-(69); no internal contradictions arise, and there is freedom to

make a variety of distorted states that interpolate contracted and extended sheath. The

unconstrained kinematic variables can be taken to be local twist and radius, which for

distorted states turn out to be ¯γ1, . . . , ¯γ23 and ρ1, . . . , ρ23. If these variables are subject to a

simple interpolation between extended and contracted sheath, by deﬁning

¯γj = µ(j) (2π/21) + (1

where, for example, µ(j) is a simple “tanh” transition layer, µ(s) = 1

then one can exhibit a contracting sheath as is shown in Figure 8. These pictures are

produced in this way, using the constraints (67) and (69) to determine the λj and θj and

then placing all in the formula (57), as directed by (63). All three of these pictures have

the same interfacial width w = 1.5 and interfacial positions j0 = 4, 12, 20, respectively.

These are not necessarily equilibrium states, as the computation of these would depend on

a quantitative knowledge of the energy function, which we do not yet know.

36

FIG. 9: Nucleation of the phase transformation in T4 sheath as viewed from below. Left: extended

sheath. Right: view of sheath with the ﬁrst annulus fully transformed, as in the leftmost picture

of Figure 8.

These pictures are interesting from the point of view of nucleation. One of the important

issues (raised in [16]) is that T4 tail sheath is at a scale that would seem to suppress

martensitic phase transformation. Brieﬂy, the argument is the following: in order to have

phase transformation with a distortion one expects an interface to pass through the body

having a transition layer between phases. But because of the scaling between bulk and

interfacial energy, the interfacial energy should dominate at suﬃciently small scales, and,

therefore, in a suﬃciently small body, one would necessarily pay more free energy for the

transition layer than the lowering of free energy due to the presence of the new phase. In

the present case “interfacial” and“bulk” energies are better thought of as line and surface

energies, but the argument is similar. Thus, nucleation is expected to be an important

issue for phase transitions at small scales, and this is particularly true in the present case in

view of the enormous transformation strain of T4 tail sheath. It is known from the work of

Moody that transformation begins at the baseplate. The distortion of the ﬁrst annulus upon

nucleation can be seen in Figure 8. An alternative view is seen in Figure 9 which shows a

view from below; in this ﬁgure the lowest annulus is nearly fully transformed (j0 = 4) on

the left while the corresponding untransformed sheath is shown on the right.

Finally, a brief remark about constraints and frame-indiﬀerence. It is well-known that

37

internal constraints in mechanical systems should be frame-indiﬀerent, and this may not

be obvious in the present case. In (57) there is some freedom of how one assigns a change

of frame, either attributing this to changes of γ, ρ, λ, R1,1 or, for example, to changes of

Qγ (at constant γ), Qπ/3, t0, t, y1, R1,1. The latter is preferred, and also preserves the

1-D ansatz. The precise form of a change of frame y

C. Free energy

Having reduced the complexity of the energy by formulating constraints for a 1-D ansatz,

we are now in the position to suggest a relatively simple form of the energy function for

nonuniform states of the form (63). We take the independent variables to be ¯γ1, . . . , ¯γ23 and

ρ1, . . . , ρ23. In the extended T4 tail sheath the main helix is the only direction of strong

bonding; however, in contracted sheath there are three bonding directions, as identiﬁed by

Moody [15] and Leiman et al. [12]. These are the bonds (i, j)

(i, j + 1), (i, j)

(71)

Here we have omitted separate consideration of boundary molecules; to account for molecules

beyond the boundaries, we do a suitable periodic extension. Recall that the ψ1, ψ2, ψ3 depend

on certain objective quantities, the t’s and Q’s, cf., (19).

We assume the 1-D ansatz (63) and the constraints (67), (68), (69). If we write out all

of the frame-indiﬀerent expressions appearing in the arguments of ψ1 in the sum (71), we

have

RT

i,j(yi,j+1 −

yi,j) = g(ρj, ρj+1, ¯γj),

(72)

where f and g are somewhat complicated algebraic vector-valued functions. We recall that

this bond (along the main helix) guides the assembly of the extended state and is preserved

throughout contraction. Since this bond is relaxed in the extended state and undergoes

38

relatively small deformations, one simple way to model it is as a harmonic function centered

at the extended state:

this energy is minimized by the uniform state: this term is somewhat like the terms of the

energy of a liquid crystal.

The bond (i, j), (i

1, j + 1) spans between adjacent main helices. This bond is largely

−

non-existent in the extended sheath and its formation drives the contraction. However, the

energy ψ2 for this bond depends on the same set of variables ρj, ρj+1, ¯γj as for (i, j), (i, j + 1).

The radius and pitch of adjacent turns of the main helix provides a measure of the second

bond’s state. If the adjacent turns are close to the contracted state then the bond is formed.

For conﬁgurations where the helices are far apart the bond is essentially broken. And for

conﬁgurations where the helices become very close there is a strong repulsion. Consistent

with this we propose the potential

and its ﬁrst derivative vanish (It is continuously diﬀerentiable). This part of the energy

depends on the parameters ˜ρc, ˜λc, c, k4, k5, a, which have the following interpretations. For
λ > c the energy contribution to ψ2 vanishes (i.e., the bond is broken). The values ˜ρc, ˜λc

are the minimizing values of ρ, λ for ψ2; in practice, we adjust these so that the measured

values ρc, λc are absolute minimizers of the total energy. The value a is the bond dissociation

energy; k4 controls the stiﬀness of this bond with respect to changes of radius, and k5 favors

uniformity. The term containing k5 multiples

not in force when the bond is broken. The third bond (i, j), (i

depends on the pitch and radius of the second nearest helix, and it involves the larger set

of variables ρj, ρj+1, ρj+2, ¯γj, ¯γj+1. We take it to have a simple form similar to that of the

that minimizes each term (The individual terms of the sum are minimized at the same

uniform state). We use the notation

φ(ρ, λ) = ψ(ρ, ρ, ρ, λ, λ)

(77)

for the energy per annulus of uniform states.

A simple explicit energy that uses all of the measured data that we have available, but

24 kcal). This gives the double-well energy pictured in Figure 10. Here the choice

of a reﬂects the calorimetric measurement of Arisaka, Engel and Klump [17] that gives

φ(ρc, λc) = 60 zcal/annulus, based on arguments described at the end of this

φ(ρe, λe)

−
subsection.

The tendency toward uniform states plays an important role during self-assembly of

tail sheath. During assembly, the baseplate forces the ﬁrst annulus to have the extended

radius, ρ1 = ρe. As subsequent annuli are added they do so as to match the radius of

the annulus below. The second and third bonding directions remain incomplete, since the

formation of these bonds would require the annuli to adopt the contracted radius. Proper

assembly is accomplished by design; the penalty for mismatching a neighboring annulus

outweighs the energy the could be liberated by forming the additional bonds. Our energy

given above has the ﬂexibility to model this behavior through two features: 1) the state

(ρe, λe) is a minimizer of energy with respect to all uniform small perturbations of (ρ, λ),

and 2) the terms involving k3, k5, k6, k7 can be tuned so that the addition of a new layer

onto the growing extended sheet would be penalized from being added with (ρ, λ) near the

contracted values, even though these have lower uniform energy. The complete analysis of

self-assembly would require a molecule-by-molecule growth mechanism, involving boundary

energies, but the present energetic considerations are expected to play a role.

41

For the rest of the paper we use a more general energy than the special form given above,

but one that retains some of its essential features. That is we assume an energy per annulus
of the form ψ(ρj, ρj+1, ρj+2, ¯λj, ¯λj+1) (cf., (76)) having the properties

ψ(ρc, ρc, ρc, λc, λc) < ψ(ρ1, ρ2, ρ3, λ1, λ2)

(ρe, ρe, ρe, λe, λe),

(78)

For this more general energy we retain the notation φ(ρ, λ) = ψ(ρ, ρ, ρ, λ, λ), so it follows

from the above that

φ(ρc, γc) < φ(ρ, γ)

for all (ρ, γ)

= (ρc, γc),

φ(ρe, γe) < φ(ρ, γ)

for all (ρ, γ)

= (ρe, γe) but near (ρe, γe).

(79)

We make one other assumption on the height diﬀerence between the energy wells.

In

[17] Arisaka et al. did calorimetry on T4 tail sheaths with contraction triggered by two

methods: raising the temperature to 72 C and by increasing the concentration of urea. The

former gave -44 kcal/mole (of gp18 molecules) whereas the latter gave -25 kcal/mole (of gp18

molecules). We use the former number here as it was considered the more accurate by these

authors. From the details of the measurement, raising the temperature did not give reversible

contraction, but rather irreversible contraction, and temperatures higher than 72 C caused

denaturation of the whole sheath. Thus, one can infer that the free energy of contracted

sheath is still lower than of extended sheath at 72 C, though not as low as at 25 C. Without

any additional information and considering that at least spontaneous contraction occurred

at 72 C, we estimate the height diﬀerence between the wells by the following procedure. We

restore the temperature dependence of φ and Taylor expand in the temperature, omitting

the error terms,

φ(ρ, λ, θ2) = φ(ρ, λ, θ1) +

∂φ(ρ, λ, θ1)
∂θ

(θ2 −

θ1).

(80)

We put θ1 = 25 C and θ2 = 72 C, evaluate (80) at (ρe, λe) and (ρc, λc) and subtract,

estimating φ(ρe, λe, θ2)

φ(ρc, λc, θ2). Now, as is common in the interpretation of calori-

≈

diﬀerence as the latent heat:

θ2(

∂φ(ρc, λc, θ1)

∂θ

−

) = 440 zcal/annulus.

(81)

Here we have ignored the temperature dependence of the entropy evaluated at either well

separately. Combining (80) and (81) we get that the entropy diﬀerence of the two phases is

1.27 (zcal/K annulus) and that

φ(ρe, λe)

φ(ρc, λc) = 60 zcal/annulus.

D. Some simple uniform deformations and some relations between moduli

For the purpose of deﬁning various moduli, it is convenient to introduce the free energy

per unit reference length (the reference being the contracted state) by deﬁning

φc(ρ, γ) =

φ(ρ, λ).

1
λc

(83)

Second derivatives of φc(ρ, λ) with respect to the pair (ρ, λ) have interpretations as various

moduli. For example, if we consider small deformations about, say, contracted sheath, then

we write

this form is positive-deﬁnite.

We now interpret these moduli A, B, C. Working within the 1D ansatz, suppose we hold

the annulus j = 1 ﬁxed and apply an axial force f = f e3 to annulus j = 23, treated as a

dead load. Then the total energy of sheath and loading device is

Ψ(y1,1, R1,1 , . . . , y6,23, R6,23)

(88)

(89)

(91)

(92)

in macroscopic elasticity the torsional and tensile moduli are governed by diﬀerent elastic

constants (i.e., the shear and Young’s moduli, respectively). This unusual behavior arises

from our unusual constraints.

Finally, we brieﬂy consider the resistance of protein structures to internal pressure. This

may be relevant to the interactions between the sheath and tail tube, so in fact it is more

related to extended sheath (It is also of course highly relevant to the packaging of DNA in

capsids [18]). For internal pressure p, the associated loading device energy is 23λπρ2p. It is

trivial to work out the associated moduli so we do not record that here.

What is more interesting is to work out the reaction forces. When a body is constrained,

there should be reaction forces, that is, certain kinds of forces that do not produce defor-

mation. In the present setting but in the fully nonlinear case, we consider a sheath subject

to a tensile force f , a twisting moment M and an internal pressure p altogether, with an

associated loading device energy

22f λ

22Mγ + 22λπρ2p. Taking the ﬁrst variation of

−

−

the energy with respect to (ρ, γ) we see that the resulting two equations do not uniquely

determine the three unknowns (f, M, p). In fact it turns out that changes of p generically

lead to deformation and the constraint force only involves f and M. The result can be

stated in the following way. Suppose that the sheath is in equilibrium at a state (˜ρ, ˜γ) corre-

sponding to generalized forces (f, M, p). Then, (˜ρ, ˜γ) is in equilibrium if (f, M) are changed

to (f + f1, M + M1), where,

M1 =

(93)

Alternatively, this condition can be thought of in terms of work: changes of force and

moment consistent with (93) do no work on the sheath.

IX. RELAXED STATES

It is interesting to contrast our theory of the protein sheet with nonlinear continuum

theories of plates and shells. As a related example, the mechanical behavior of carbon nan-

otubes have been shown to conform to such continuum theories in many aspects, especially

regarding elasticity and buckling [19]. The results given above arising from the constraints,

especially the ﬁrst order Poynting eﬀect and the relations between elastic moduli, suggest

45

diﬀerently, but these results are closely connected with the presence of the constraints. As

we show here, the predictions of the unconstrained theory are also essentially diﬀerent from

continuum theories. This is not fundamentally a “nanoscale” phenomenon, but is related to

the particular structure of protein sheet: compact globular proteins with local bonding and

a sensitivity to orientation.

To review, nonlinear continuum theories of thin plates and shells come in various varieties,

depending on the strength of the applied forces (for a rigorous treatment and an overview of

the regimes, see [20]). For the largest applied forces there is membrane theory, deﬁned in the

following way:

let ϕ(G) be the three-dimensional nonlinear elastic energy of the material

expressed as a function of the deformation gradient G. We suppose as usual that ϕ is

frame-indiﬀerent, ϕ(QG) = ϕ(G) for all Q

SO(3) and that ϕ is minimized on SO(3). Let

∈
(e1, e2, e3) be an orthonormal basis with e3 normal to the plate in its reference conﬁguration,

and write G = Gij in this basis. To describe membrane theory we express the deformation
gradient as its three column vectors, G = (y1|

relative to the “middle surface”). Suppose that we have no boundary conditions imposed.

Then, the energy in (94) is minimized by (y, b) satisfying

y,1 = R(x1, x2)e1, y,2 = R(x1, x2)e2, b = R(x1, x2)e3, R(x1, x2)

SO(3).

(95)

∈

The third of these equations simply determines b, while the ﬁrst two restrict the deformation.

In fact, the ﬁrst two of these equations deﬁne so-called isometric mappings.

Isometric

mappings are essentially the mappings that one can illustrate by taking a ﬂat sheet of paper

and deforming it, including the possibility of making folds and rather complex “crumpling”.

At the next level of approximation, for weaker forces, we have nonlinear bending theory.

This is deﬁned by the same kinematics as just described, but with the energy

In this case the energy (97) is minimized over isometric mappings only, i.e. over the solutions

of (95). Thus, in summary, isometric mappings are the basic relaxed states of plate theories:

they are the zero energy deformations of membrane theory and the ﬁnite energy deformations

of bending theory. Shell theories are variants of the above in which the given reference state

is generally curved. In that case the ﬁnite energy deformations are isometric mappings of

the curved reference state.

What are the relaxed states of the present theory? To calculate the analog of the above,

we should minimize the energy of the sheet

Ψ(y1,1, R1,1 , . . . , yN,M , RN,M )

without loading device energies or boundary conditions, over all positions and orientations.

Here we have assumed two bonding directions and we have ignored boundary molecules.

To simplify, this can be written (modulo possibly a few missing or additional boundary

molecules)

Ψ =

˜ψ1(ti,j, Qi,j) + ˜ψ2(ˆti,j, ˆQi,j),

but now it must be born in mind that the independent variables (ti,j, Qi,j, ˆti,j, ˆQi,j) are

subject to the compatibility conditions (24). These conditions, repeated here

minimize (99) by minimizing the “integrand” ˜ψ1(ti,j, Qi,j) + ˜ψ2(ˆti,j, ˆQi,j), for this would

typically give a minimizer, say, of the form

(100)

˜ψ2(ˆt, ˆQ)

One can consider more complex rearrangements of the sum (99), with diﬀerent “integrands”,

but the analogous problem arises again. For example, the apparently most promising rear-

Ψ =

˜ψ1(ti,j, Qi,j) + ˜ψ2(ˆti,j, ˆQi,j) + ˜ψ1(ti,j+1, Qi,j+1) + ˜ψ2(ˆti+1,j, ˆQi+1,j).

rangement is the sum[37]

Z2
X(i, j)

∈

∩ D

i + j = even

Here the summand contains exactly the independent variables appearing in the constraints,

and therefore we could minimize it with respect to all values of the independent variables

subject to the constraints. But one then sees that the solution actually satisﬁes only the

compatibility conditions on every other cell and generically does not give a minimizer.

In discrete theory the impossibility of minimizing the energy for each each bond indi-

vidually is termed frustration.

In continuum theory the concept is similar [21]:

it is the

inability of minimizers of the energy density to satisfy conditions of compatibility inher-

ent in the kinematics[38]. We can say that our sheet is also frustrated, in the sense that

minimization of the energy density for each bond does not generically give a compatible de-

formation. Here, the word “generically” means that, even if these compatibility conditions
happen to be (accidentally) satisﬁed for a minimizer, then they are not satisﬁed if ˜ψ1 or
˜ψ2 are smoothly perturbed consistent with all of their assumed symmetries. As indicated

above, even if we allow small collections of multiple bonds and minimize the energy of these,

subject to constraints of compatibility, we also obtain a conﬁguration that is not compatible

in the large.

In biology, unlike materials science, there is the phenomenon of evolution of materials to

achieve ﬁtness. Thus for a protein sheet, there might be reasons, for example, to achieve

a particularly low energy state, for a protein sheet to be nongeneric. Thus it is of interest
to assume that t, Q and ˆt, ˆQ minimize, respectively, ˜ψ1, ˜ψ2 and also satisfy (102) and then

48

to see what kinds of sheets emerge. We call such states fully relaxed states: each bond is

relaxed and the conﬁguration is compatible.

To calculate all fully relaxed states, we merely have to characterize all solutions of (102)

and then calculate the implied positions and orientations. This is a straightforward algebraic

exercise and we just give the results. First, a useful characterization of the solutions of (102)

is the following. Each solution falls into one of the categories below:

1. Q and ˆQ are coaxial, Qe = ˆQe = e,

Now, using these results we go back and compute the uniquely determined (up to overall

But this is exactly of the form of (57) for T4 tail sheath! (Note: recall that in the formula
for tail sheath the R1,1 was moved through the Qi ˆQj using the remark given at the end of

Section V)).

It is intriguing to ponder whether these fully relaxed states are actually realized by

tail sheath (or other protein sheets) and, if so, the implications of this with regard to

as enumerated above, the sheet will not look exactly like tail sheath. We explored this

numerically by choosing various cases and found that the general appearance is however

much like tail sheath; in fact, it can be proved from the formula (104) that the bonding

direction (i, j)

a generic picture of a fully relaxed state, with the molecule represented by a simple ellipsoid.

To complete this story, we make brief remarks about the remaining cases of the enumer-
ation above. In item 1, if either Q = I or ˆQ = I then the appearance is still more or less

like Figure 11, but one family of helices degenerates to straight lines of molecules that are
parallel to the axis of the cylinder. If both Q = I and ˆQ = I, then the cylinder degenerates

to a planar sheet, with crystalline symmetry, and parallel orientations of molecules. Finally,

item 2 is a bit surprising; it describes a collection of four molecules, not generally at the

corners of a regular tetrahedron, but such that each pair of the molecules is twinned, that

is, individuals of the pair are related by a 180◦ rotation.

In summary, our theory of a protein sheet is generically frustrated. Energy minimizers

are generally naturally curved, as in shell theories, but this curvature is determined by the

energy. Isometric mappings seem to play no role here. In our theory if one considers energy
densities ˜ψ1, ˜ψ2 that are minimized at compatible pairs (t, Q), (ˆt, ˆQ) (i.e., fully relaxed

states) then the energy minimizers look much like the tail sheath of bacteriophage T4 and

are given by simple formulas.

X. EXPERIMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE THEORY

We have noted above several places above where there are possible experimental tests

of our predictions. These include the extension-twist relation (Figure 6), the linearized

behavior near contracted or extended sheath (89)-(92), and the reaction forces that preserve

deformation (93). We now discuss two other types of predictions that relate directly to

biological and interesting nonbiological behavior.

50

FIG. 11: A generic fully relaxed state.

A. The force of penetration

One of the most important predictions of our model is the force of penetration. Consider

applying an axial force f to contracted sheath, so as to stress-induce the transformation

to extended sheath. Alternatively, one can imagine applying suﬃcient tension to extended

sheath to just prevent contraction, i.e., the stall force. We neglect the interactions with the

tail tube, assuming it to be weakly bonded to the sheath even when it is in the extended

state, as is thought to be true, [22], [12]. For small values of f the behavior is given by

the analysis of (85)-(89), and we expect the initial slope of the force-elongation curve (f

vs. (λ

λc)/λc) given by the modulus λ2

c(AC

the response near transition may depend on details of the loading device – whether hard or

soft, for example – but one expects some kind of load drop on nucleation. The transformation

is expected to take place via movement of an interface, as pictured qualitatively in Figure 8

and at approximately constant free energy, because a bias of free energy toward either phase

would, by energy minimization, tend to drive out the interface, one way or the other. This

suggests the criterion

The error term depends also on geometric factors and can be written explicitly, but we

note that it is of the form (f 2/tensile modulus). Thus, if f

tensile modulus then this

term is negligible as compared to f , and the force at transformation is a simple ratio of the

height diﬀerence between the energy well minima at extended and contracted sheath and

the diﬀerence between the lengths of the sheath. These kinds of results are well known in

the study of phase transformations.

Of course, the virus uses the reverse transformation, from extended to contracted sheath,

during penetration. The maximum force available for penetration is expected to be also

ftrans.

We can evaluate the force of contraction based on the height diﬀerence between the wells,

accounting for the reservations given at the end of Subsection VIII C. Combining (108) and

52

(82), we get,

ftrans = 103 pN

(109)

By comparison, the stall force measured by laser tweezers during DNA packaging in φ29

was 57 pN [1]. We would tend to think that the number 103 is a lower estimate for the

actual force, because ∆φ is underestimated at 72 C as explained in Subsection VIII C. If we

divide this force by the cross-sectional area of the sheath to get a stress, we get about 0.5

MPa. This is quite low as a (maximum) transformation stress in a macroscopic crystalline

martensitic material. However, the transformation strain in T4 sheath is enormous, so, if

we calculate the energy density of contraction based on these numbers, we get numbers that

are comparable to those measured in the best shape memory materials, which themselves

exhibit the highest energy densities in any known actuator system [23].

The transformation can also be induced by applying a pure axial moment. This leads to

the analogue of (105)-(108), except using the loading device energy

22Mγ, and gives the

moment at transformation of

B. Biomolecular epitaxy, patterning and devices

In this section we explore some more speculative ideas. T4 tail sheath is a kind of

biomolecular actuator, and one could imagine that it could function as part of a man-made

machine [24] that could interact in an intimate way with biological organisms. Tubes of

polysheath several microns long have been synthesized [25], [26]; polysheath is similar to,

but not exactly the same as, contracted sheath. Tubes of extended sheath have not been

synthesized separate from the the baseplate and tail tube, and this is understandable in view

FIG. 12: Edge-on view, slightly below horizontal, of the interface between contracted (left) and

extended (right) sheath.

sheath via epitaxy.

of their higher free energy and also the possible role of the baseplate in stabilizing extended

One basic interesting line of thought is to consider the possibility of changing the heights

of the energy wells. As is true in a great many biological systems, hydrophobicity plays a

critical role, and this can be appreciated in the present case by looking at Figure 4. There,

it is clear by inspection that extended sheath exposes substantially more surface area to the

surrounding solution than contracted sheath, and this qualitatively explains its higher free

energy. But it also indicates that the relative free energies of extended and contracted sheath

are amenable to adjustment via manipulation of the solution chemistry. Systematic studies

[26] of the eﬀect of solution chemistry on the breakup of parts of the virus (capsid, neck,

tail sheath, tail tube, baseplate, tail ﬁbers) demonstrate sensitivity to solution chemistry.

Apparently, solutions that cause contracted tail sheath to extend have not yet been found.

However, if by this means one could exchange the heights of the wells, then tail sheath would

be like a shape memory material. In a highly schematic way, one could alter the solution

so that extended sheath is stable. Then one could add an axial tensile force to the sheath.

Again manipulating the solution, one could return it to phage-physiological conditions and,

if the force was not too large (i.e., below the value ftrans of (108)) then the sheath would

transform to the contracted form, while doing work on the force. This would be a machine

that converts chemical free energy of the solution to mechanical energy. The very small

cross-section of the sheath would allow it to target a small region of a cell. One could

consider the possibility of vast arrays of these tubes. In this regard, we note that ordered

54

planar arrays of whole viruses have been deposited on surfaces (not using epitaxy) by Lee

et al. [27].

In the following discussion we allow rather drastic changes of the sheath, but we enforce

the constraints (59) and (62), these being in our view fundamental to its behavior. T4 sheath

is in the shape of a cylinder, but it is interesting to think about the possibility of slitting along

a generator and unrolling it. We ﬁrst note that it is possible to do this without violating the

constraints. Secondly, extended tail sheath exhibits an epitaxial relation to the baseplate,

and this likely plays a role in self-assembly of the sheath during formation and subsequent

stabilization. Thus we suggest the possibility of growing ﬁlms of tail sheath epitaxially. In

general, epitaxial growth is aided by a substrate with the same lattice parameters as the

sheath, that is also chemically compatible with the sheath. The most likely possibility is

to grow the lower free energy contracted form (see the left of Figure 13 which shows the

epitaxial surface).

It is interesting to note that epitaxial growth of protein sheets could

possibly take advantage of the shapes of molecules and the presence of functional groups,

in addition to the matching of lattice parameters and use of surface chemistry, the latter

principles familiar from the epitaxial growth of semiconductors.

By direct calculation GT G has eigenvalues 2.06, 0.567. As is known from the theory of

martensitic transformations in sheets[40], the fact that these values straddle 1 (i.e., 2.06 >

1 > 0.567) means that there are exactly two interfaces on the sheet where extended and

contracted sheet meet compatibly. These are pictured in Figure 13. We have rotated the

sheets suitably so that the interfaces are horizontal. The original orientation can be inferred

from the dark lines of atoms, which correspond to what was the main helix (cf. Figure 5)

before unrolling. A cross section of the interface on the right is seen in Figure 12.

Note that on the left of Figure 13 the dark line of atoms is approximately in the direction

of the interface. This reﬂects the constraint, which embodies the idea that the two phases are

approximately equally stretched along this line. The reason that this line does not exactly

coincide with the interface is related to the use of the eﬀective radius, rather than the actual

radius, in (59). As mentioned above, the values of lattice parameters are likely to change a

bit with “unrolling”, leading to interfaces that diﬀer somewhat from those shown in Figure

13.

From Figure 13 one can imagine the possibility of stress-inducing the transformation by

shear as shown in Figure 14. This would provide a direct measure of the relative heights

56

of the energy wells and therefore of the contraction force. Ideally, one could begin with an

epitaxially grown sheet, as discussed above, and release the ﬁlm from the substrate on the

medium gray region of Figure 14; some of the techniques developed in the microactuator

community [28](such as backside etching) for patterning and releasing single crystal ﬁlms

could be relevant. Then by applying shear and slight extension as shown in Figure 14 the

phase transformation could be made to occur. Technically, the corners between phases may

introduce stress concentrations in such an experiment, but this can be overcome by using

a suitable indentor that induces an appropriate out-of-plane deformation. Once again, it

would be fascinating to bring chemistry into such an experiment by altering the solution

around the sheet.

APPENDIX B: APPROXIMATION OF ELECTRON DENSITY MAPS

Many arguments of this paper relied on the approximate shape and orientation of the

molecules. In order to have a reasonable but fairly simple representation of the molecules

of tail sheath, we approximated the electron density maps of Leiman et al. ([11]; we are

grateful to Petr Leiman for providing prepublication data from high resolution cryo-electron

micrographs of extended sheath).

Information about how the positions and orientations

were extracted from the representations is described at the end of Section VII A.

The maps themselves showed clearly the presence of domains. These have the general

appearance of nestled ellipsoids, so we approximated them by overlapping ellipsoids. We

did this by partitioning the data by domain (the colored regions of Figure 15). Then we

computed the total electronic charge and center of mass of each domain. Using charge

neutrality we made mass density proportional to electronic density. This can have errors

arising mainly from the presence of H atoms, but in fact the total charge of a domain (or

molecule) in contracted vs. extended state diﬀered by more than this error, so the quality

of the data did not justify a more detailed analysis.

58

FIG. 15: Comparison of electron density maps and ellipsoidal approximations. See text.

With the center of mass of the domain now ﬁxed, we adjusted the principle axes of the

ellipsoids to match approximately the sectional data. Sections of the selected ellipsoids are

shown in Figure 15 superimposed on the data. In this ﬁgure the concentric circles deﬁne the

axis of the tail sheath and the Z values indicate the slices of the electron density map which

were averaged. Here Z is an axial variable measured from a ﬁxed (but arbitrary) reference.

Domains for both extended and contracted sheath are shown. The ellipses are sections of

the ellipsoid (for the enclosed domain) at the corresponding average value of Z (i.e., for Z=

0 to 10 the slice through the ellipsoid was taken at Z = 5).

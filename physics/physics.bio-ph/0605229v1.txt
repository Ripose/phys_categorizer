Abstract. We investigate a driven diﬀusive lattice gas model with two oppositely
moving species of particles. The model is motivated by bi-directional traﬃc of ants
on a pre-existing trail. A third species, corresponding to pheromones used by the ants
for communication, is not conserved and mediates interactions between the particles.
Here we study the spatio-temporal organization of the particles. In the uni-directional
variant of this model it is known to be determined by the formation and coarsening
of “loose clusters”. For our bi-directional model, we show that the interaction of
oppositely moving clusters is essential.
In the late stages of evolution the cluster
size oscillates because of a competition between their ‘shredding’ during encounters
with oppositely moving counterparts and subsequent ”coarsening” during collision-
free evolution. We also establish a nontrivial dependence of the spatio-temporal
organization on the system size.

1. Introduction

Systems of interacting driven particles are of current interest in statistical physics
for understanding the fundamental principles of spatio-temporal organization far from
equilibrium as well as for possible wide ranging practical applications [1, 2]. The simplest
model of this type with only one species of particles is the so-called totally asymmetric
simple exclusion process (TASEP). In the TASEP, a particle is picked up randomly and
moved forward by one lattice spacing, with the hopping probability q+, provided the
target site on the one-dimensional lattice is empty.
Most of the earlier models with more than one species of particles [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
addressed mainly the questions on the (im)possibility of spontaneous symmetry

Figure 1. A snapshot of an ant-trail on a hanging cable. It can be regarded as strictly
one-dimensional. But, nevertheless, traﬃc ﬂow in opposite directions is possible as two
ants, which face each other on the upper side of the cable, can exchange their positions
if one of them, at least temporarily, switches over to the lower side of the cable.

breaking, phase separation, etc. in one-dimensional stochastic driven systems. Here
we extend the two-species models like, for example, ABC model [4, 5] and AHR model
[6] to develop a three-species model [11]. The density of the new species introduced in our
model, which corresponds to the pheromones secreted by the ants for communication,
is not conserved by the dynamics of the system and its coupling to the two other
conserved variables leads to uncommon features of the spatio-temporal organisations of
the conserved particles. For a special choice of the model parameters our model becomes
identical to the AHR model classes (see Sec. 3).

Our model is motivated by a real-life situation where bi-directional ant-traﬃc in an
eﬀectively one-dimensional system is observed. Fig. 1 shows a hanging cable which is
part of an ant-trail. Ants prefer moving on the upper side of the cable, which would
make the motion strictly one-dimensional. If ants moving in opposite directions meet
head-on, after short “negotiations” one of them would switch to the lower part of the
cable temporarily in order to make passing possible. Due to the “negotiations” this
process leads to slowing down of both the ants. We capture this entire process by
an exchange of the positions of the two ants with a suﬃciently low probability which
corresponds to a slower movement of each of them as compared to a freely moving ant.
The mathematical formulation of the model in terms of such exchange probabilities is
very similar to the formulations of the class of one-dimensional stochastic models of
driven-diﬀusive lattice gases to which the AHR and ABC models belong.

The number of particles leaving a site per unit time is called the ﬂux or current; the
ﬂux-versus-density relation is often referred to as the fundamental diagram. We study
interplay of spatio-temporal organization and ﬂow (fundamental diagram) in the system
by a combination of analytical arguments and extensive computer simulations.

2. The model

→

In our model the right-moving (left-moving) particles, represented by R (L), are never
allowed to move towards left (right); these two groups of particles are the analogs of
the outbound and nest-bound ants in a bi-directional traﬃc on the same trail. Thus,
no U-turn is allowed. In addition to the TASEP-like hopping of the particles onto the
neighboring vacant sites in the respective directions of motion, the R and L particles on
nearest-neighbour sites and facing each other are allowed to exchange their positions,
i.e., the transition RL
LR takes place, with the probability K. This might be
considered as a minimal model for the motion of ants on a hanging cable as shown in
Fig. 1. When a outbound ant and a nest-bound ant face each other on the upper side
of the cable, they slow down and, eventually, pass each other after one of them, at least
temporarily, switches over to the lower side of the cable. Similar observations have been
made for normal ant-trails where ants pass each other after turning by a small angle
to avoid head-on collision [17, 16]. In our model, as commonly observed in most real
ant-trails, none of the ants is allowed to overtake another moving in the same direction.
Ants drop a chemical (generically called pheromone) on the substrate as they move
forward [12]. They can follow the trail by picking up the “smell” of the trail pheromone
provided the pheromone evaporates suﬃciently slowly with time. We now introduce

Competition of coarsening and shredding of clusters in a driven diﬀusive lattice gas

a third species of particles, labelled by the letter P , which are intended to capture
the essential features of pheromone. The P particles are deposited on the lattice by
the R and L particles when the latter hop out of a site; an existing P particle at a
site disappears when a R or L particle arrives at the same location. The P particles
cannot hop but can evaporate, with a probability f per unit time, independently from
the lattice. None of the lattice sites can accommodate more than one particle at a time.
From now onwards, we shall refer to this model as the P RL model. The state of the
system is updated in a random-sequential manner. Because of the periodic boundary
conditions, the densities of the R and the L particles are conserved. In contrast, the
density of the P particles is a non-conserved variable. The distinct initial states and the
corresponding ﬁnal states for pairs of nearest-neighbor sites are shown in ﬁg.2 together
with the respective transition probabilities.

In both the limits φ = 1 and φ = 0 this model reduces
to our earlier model [18, 19], motivated by uni-directional ant-traﬃc, which is closely
related to the bus-route models [20, 21] and the models of pedestrian dynamics [22, 23].
One unusual feature of this PRL model is that the ﬂux does not vanish in the dense-
packing limit c
1. In fact, in the full-ﬁlling limit c = 1, the exact non-vanishing ﬂux
F+ = Kc+c− = F− at c+ + c− = c = 1 arises only from the exchange of the R and L
particles, irrespective of the magnitudes of f, Q and q.
In the special case Q = q = qH the hopping of the ants become independent of
pheromone. This special case of the PRL model is identical to the AHR model [6]
with q− = 0 = κ. A simple homogeneous mean-ﬁeld approximation (HMFA) yields the

oppositely moving particles contributes to the ﬂux. Moreover, the sharp rise of the ﬂux
over a narrow range of c observed in both Fig. 3 (a) and (b) arise from the nonmonotonic
variation of the average speed with density, an eﬀect which was also observed in our
earlier model for uni-directional ant traﬃc [18, 19]. This nonmonotonicity was shown to
be a consequence of the formation of so-called loose clusters. These are regions in space
where the particle density clc is larger than the average density c, but not maximal,
i.e. c < clc < 1. These loose cluster dominate the behaviour at intermediate particle

ranged attractive interactions introduced by the pheromones.
In the special limits φ = 0 and φ = 1, over a certain regime of density (especially at
small f ), the particles are known [18, 19] to form “loose” (i.e., non-compact) clusters
[19] which are deﬁned to be regions of the system with a density cℓc that is larger than
the average global density, i.e., c < cℓc < 1. If the system evolves from a random initial
condition at t = 0, then during coarsening of the cluster, its size R(t) at time t is given
t1/2 [20, 21]. Therefore, in the absence of encounter with oppositely moving
by R(t)
particles, τ±, the coarsening time for the right-moving and left-moving particles would
grow with system size as τ+ ∼
In the PRL model with periodic boundary conditions, the oppositely moving ‘loose”
clusters “collide” against each other periodically. Let us deﬁne τg to be the time gap
between the successive collisions of the two clusters which is the time interval between
the end of one collision and the beginning of the next collision. It is straightforward to
see that τg increases linearly with the system size following τg ∼

cluster “shreds” the oppositely moving cluster; both clusters shred the other equally if

diﬀerent from those of the clusters before the collision. But, at present, we do not have
any theory to predict the changes in these properties caused by the collision.
In small systems the “shredded” clusters get opportunity for signiﬁcant re-coarsening
before getting shredded again in the next encounter with the oppositely moving particles.
But, in suﬃciently large systems, shredded appearance of the clusters persists. This
is demonstrated clearly by the space-time plots for two diﬀerent system sizes in
Fig. 8. However, we observed practically no diﬀerence in the fundamental diagrams
for M = 1000 and M = 4000 (see Fig. 9). Following the methods of ref. [21], we
have computed R(t) starting from random initial conditions. The data corresponding

to φ = 1 are consistent with the asymptotic growth law R(t)
R(t) grows as t1/3 (dotted line in Fig. 10 corresponds to a slope of t1/3) however in the
later stage it grows as t1/2 (dashed line in Fig. 10 corresponds to a slope of t1/2). In
sharp contrast, for φ = 0.5, R(t) saturates to a much smaller value that is consistent
with highly shredded appearance of the clusters in Fig. 6(a).
Thus, coarsening and shredding phenomena compete against each other and this
competition determines the overall spatio-temporal pattern. Therefore, in the late stage
of evolution, the system settles to a state where, because of alternate occurrence of
shredding and coarsening, the typical size of the clusters varies periodically. Moreover,
comparing Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(c), we ﬁnd that, for given c and φ, increasing K leads to
sharper speeding up of the clusters during collision so long as K is not much smaller than
q. Both the phenomena of shredding and speeding during collisions of the oppositely
moving loose clusters arise from the fact that, during such collisions, the dominant
process is the exchange of positions, with probability K, of oppositely-moving ants that
face each other.

4. Conclusions

The P RL model reported in this paper, is motivated by bi-directional ant traﬃc. In a
spatially constrained situation, e.g., on a hanging cable (Fig.1), such a single-lane model
is adequate, whereas otherwise a full two-lane model [24] is required.

The main eﬀect of the new species of particles P is that coupling of its non-
conserving dynamics with the conserved dynamics of the L and R species of particles
gives rise to an eﬀective pheromone-mediated interaction between the particles of the
same species. This pheromone-mediated interactions between the L (R) particles gives
to a left-moving (right-moving) cluster. This tendency for “coarsening”, induced by the
pheromones, then competes with the “shredding” process which occurs during collision
of oppositely moving clusters in a ﬁnite system with periodic boundary conditions.

The most surprising ﬁnding is a nontrivial and, at ﬁrst sight, counter-intuitive,
system size dependence of the spatio-temporal organization which, we believe, could be
relevant also for other driven systems with competing aggregation and disintegration. It
would be interesting to obtain a more quantitative description of the shredding process
that allows to quantify this size dependence. Work in this direction is currently under
progress.

Physical Parameters for Biconcave Shape Vesicles

Abstract. The Helfrich’s shape equation of axisymmetric vesciles is studied. A suﬃcient condition on the
physical parameters and some geometric properties are discovered for the formation of biconcave shape vesicles.

The study of the biconcave-discoid shape of a
red blood cell has been a continued interest in the
last two decades. Theoretically, the shape of the cell
is to minimize a certain bending energy. Like mini-
mal surfaces and surfaces with constant mean cur-
vature in geometry, the expected biconcave shape
surface is a critical one for the bending energy func-
tional. The early proposal for the bending energy
by Canham [1] is purely geometric, which mainly
involves the Willmore functional,
It
is well known among diﬀerential geometers that
the unique minimum of the Willmore functional for
topologically spherical vesicles is the round sphere,
which diﬀers from blood cells observed experimen-
tally. Thus, Willmore functional or Canham’s idea
is not a good model for the shape of red blood cells.
This is also observed by physicists [2].

[15, ch. 7].

It is known that the shape of blood cells and
other biological membranes is closely related to
the formation of lipid bilayer vesicle in aqueous
medium. Based on this and the elasticity of lipid bi-
layer, Helfrich proposed a modiﬁed bending energy,
[4]. For a closed surface Σ, this bending energy is
a combination of geometric quantities and physical
parameters. The geometric quantities are the vol-
ume V(Σ) enclosed by Σ, the area A(Σ), the mean
curvature H and the Gaussian curvature K of Σ.
According to the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, the inte-
gral of K is a topological constant. Within a certain
topological class of Σ, Helfrich’s bending energy can
be reduced to, which we call Helfrich functional,

and inner (pi) media. Here, we have taken a sign
convention such that H is negative for spheres and
Helfrich’s numercial simulation produces a bicon-
cave shape when c0 is positive.

The general minimizer of

is not easy to ﬁnd.
In the past, much eﬀort has been spent on study-
ing axisymmetric solution to its variational equa-
tion. This equation is usually referred to as shape
equation of axisymmetric vesicles. There are nu-
merous works on axisymmetric stationary vesicles,
It is still unknown to
[2, 7, 14, 8, 12, 13, 9, 10].
scientists what conditions on the physical parame-
ters will guarantee a solution to the shape equation
corresponding to a biconcave surface.

In this letter, we provide a suﬃcent condition
under which the Helfrich shape equation of axisym-
metric vesicles has solutions of biconcave shape. Be-
sides, we also report two necessary geometric con-
ditions for the lipid bilayer vesicles, one for those
with a reﬂection symmetry and another for those of
biconcave shape. These conditions on the parame-
ters are very mild but easy to verify. In particular,
the case that c0 > 0, ˜λ > 0, and ˜p > 0 is suﬃcient
to ensure the existence of biconcave solution. The
discussion on how the combination of the parame-
ters c0, ˜λ, and ˜p aﬀects the existence of biconcave
solution will be presented in another review paper
in detail.

The suﬃcient condition for the formation of bi-
concave vesicle may be formulated in terms of a
cubic polynomial,

where c0, ˜λ = 2λ/kc, and ˜p = 2p/kc are the physical
constant parameters of the functional interpreted
as: kc is the bending rigidity, c0 the spontaneous

osmotic pressure diﬀerence between the outer (po)

We proved that if all roots of Q(t) are posi-
tive, then one can always ﬁnd axisymmetric
biconcave vesicles which are the stationary
surface for the Helfrich functional. A pictorial
summary is given at the end of this letter (p. 4).

For the necessary conditions, we observe that
if c0 > 0, the central curvature of an axisymmet-
ric stationary vesicle of biconcave shape must be
smaller than the ﬁrst positive root of Q(t), more
precisely, see (2). Furthermore, with the reﬂection
symmetry orthogonal to the rotation symmetry, the
Gaussian curvature along the “equator” (the inter-
section circle of the axisymmetric vesicle with the
plane of reﬂection) is explicitly given in terms of
the radius r∞ of the “equator” and the polynomial
Q(t), see (3).

Equation and Requirements

For an axisymmetric surface Σ, we take the rota-
tional axis to be z-axis and the plane of reﬂection
xy-plane, then a biconcave shape is obtained by re-
volving and reﬂecting a curve, given by a function
z(r)
0 deﬁned for r in some interval [0, r∞], where
r∞ is the radius of the “equator”. For a biconcave
axisymmetric surface, we expect z(r) and its deriva-
tive w = z′ to have the following graphs.

Usually, the Helfrich shape equation of axisym-
metrc vesicles is written in term of the angle ψ be-
tween the surface tangent and the plane perpendic-
ular to rotational axis [2, 6, 16]. For our discussion,
it is convenient to rewrite it in terms of the deriva-
tive of the graph w(r) = z′(r) = tan ψ. Then the
Helfrich shape equation of axisymmetrc vesicles be-
comes an equation for w, which is

The biconcave shape and symmetries are then
translated into suitable initial and boundary con-
ditions, such as, w(0) = 0; w′(0) = w′

so the initial choice w′
0 is the central meridinal cur-
vature or w′
the Gaussian curvature. Note that if
0
c0 = ˜λ = ˜p = 0, equation (1a) can be integrated
directly to a solution z = z(r) which is a circular
arc with radius 1/w′
0. This is exactly the case when
the meridinal curvature is a constant.

Necessary Conditions

˜p/2 < 0, if w′

0) < 0 and R(w′

The lower order terms in (1) capture the changes
of the meridinal curvature. Since Q(0) = R(0) =
0 is less than the smallest positive
−
root of Q(t), then both Q(w′
0) < 0.
Our analysis shows that these negativity conditions
are essential for the meridinal curvature κ(r) to
change sign. Furthermore, if the physical parame-
ters constitute a polynomial Q with only positive
roots, a solution w(r) with w′
0 small enough al-
ways satisﬁes all of our requirements. The threshold
value of w′
0 can be calculated numerically if exact
values of the parameters are given.

The meridinal curvature κ(r) of the vesicle Σ
is the most basic quantity in our analysis. From
equation (1b), if c0 > 0 and the initial curvature at
the center w′
0) > 0,
then κ(r) increases and a biconcave shape cannot
be formed. So a necessary condition for formation
of axisymmetric solution of biconcave shape in the
case that c0 > 0 is

0 is large, in the sense that R(w′

The following pictures show the behaviors of
κ(r) for two diﬀerent values of w′

The one on the left is taken with w′
0 = 0.278 so the
necessary condition is not satisﬁed. In this case, κ
blows-up at ﬁnite radial distance and the solution
only leads to a convex surface. The picture on the
right is taken with w′
0 = 0.276. In this case, the
necessary condition is satisﬁed, so κ decreases and
changes sign. But it only decays gradually and the
integral area condition is not satisﬁed. As a result,
the surface and its reﬂection intersects in R3.

There is a more subtle boundary condition im-
posed by the reﬂection symmetry. One needs to ver-
z(r) together form a stationary
ify that z(r) and
solution with respect to any variation near the plane
of reﬂection. For the situation that we discuss, it
turns out that this is true. Moreover, we obtain
a relation between the radius r∞ of the “equator”
and the Gaussian curvature K(r∞) of the vesicle at
any point on the “equator”,

This relation is easily veriﬁed for the case that c0 =

This is compatible with the fact that the solution

As a consequence of these inequalities, the graph of
z(r) has a unique point of inﬂection. After r reaches
r0, with the assumption that all roots of Q(t) are
positive, the lower order terms of equation (1b) are
dominated and the function w(r) blows down mono-
in a ﬁnite radial distance. By fur-
tonically to
ther estimating the area according to w′
0, the inte-
gral area condition can be veriﬁed whenever w′
0 is
suﬃciently small. All these behaviors of the func-
tions z(r) and w(r) with respect to Q and the choice
of w′
0 are illustrated in our summary on p. 4. The
mathematical details will be presented in a forth-
coming paper.

Discussions

Finally, we would like to remark on other solutions
which do not correspond to biconcave surfaces.

The one on the left is a solution for c0 = 1, ˜λ =
3,
˜p = 2 with w′
0 = 2. Note that w′
0 is greater than the
positive roots of R(t) and Q(t). Moreover, Q(t) has
negative roots and thus this is beyond the situation
discussed above. In this case, after w = z′ becomes
negative, it may not decrease monotonically to neg-
ative inﬁnity, which is why a second “petal” may
form.

To have a solution meeting all the requirements,
we need to impose a stronger condition that w′
0 to
be small enough, at least smaller than the positive
roots of Q. This smallness assumption on w′
0 im-
plies that not only R(w′
0) < 0.
Both κ(r) and w(r) start initially positive and be-
come negative when r reaches a certain value r0

0) < 0 but also Q(w′

The other type is a rotational solution which is
not symmetric under reﬂection in xy-plane [2, 3].
The picture is produced with c0 =
1
and ˜p = 1. The “upper” curve satisﬁes our equa-
tion (1) but not the area condition. The “lower”
curve and the reﬂected “upper” curve are both so-
lutions locally, so there is a bifurcation of solution

1, ˜λ =

at r∞. The surface only closes up by an asymmetric
one. It should be remarked that, from our numer-
ical study, not all solutions in the upper quadrant
may be closed up by an asymmetric counterpart.
For example, if the upper part satisﬁes the area
condition, the only possible lower part is the re-
ﬂection symmetric one. This suggests a possible
uniqueness of biconcave solution. However, at the
moment, there is not yet a mathematical proof.

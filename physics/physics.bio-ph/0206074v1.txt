Abstract

Chirality is considered by many scientists to be mainly a geometric concept. There
exists also a physical aspect of chirality which is largely being overlooked at. Two
examples of mechanical devices are introduced here that represent “Physical Chirality”.
These are a rotating water sprinkler and a variant of Crookes’ radiometer. When
interacting with appropriate media, they both choose only one mode of rotation out
of two possible ones. Such a behavior does not obey time-reversal invariance, which is
regarded to be a rule in classical mechanics. This is due to their chiral nature. Instead,
they do obey a space-time (ST) law of invariance, that is, what is rotating in the
opposite direction is the mirror-image of the given device. In a recent experiment of
Koumura et al. they discovered a similar behavior of a molecular rotor. The possible
biological signiﬁcance of physical chirality is emphasized hereby, and the conclusion
is that chiral molecular systems do not reach readily thermal equilibrium. In other
words: “Physical chirality does feed on negative entropy”, and therefore, it may well
be of crucial value to life.

1 Introduction

The phenomenon of structural chirality of crystals and molecules has been recognized since
the early 19th century when Arago1 and Biot2 did demonstrate the eﬀect of optical activity in
quartz crystals. Louis Pasteur3 was the ﬁrst one to observe chirality on a molecular level and
speciﬁed it as “dissymmetry”. The term “Chirality” was ﬁrst introduced by Kelvin4, who
also deﬁned this concept as a property of any object that cannot superimpose, or overlap,
completely its own mirror image.

The main reason for Kelvin to modify this term came from the fact that chirality did
not necesssarily imply a total lack of symmetry. Actually, chirality does lack the symme-
try property of reﬂection, but chiral shapes of bodies may also obey so-called continuous
symmetry operations such as rotational and/or translational symmetries.

At this point it becomes relevant to point out that the concept of chirality in science is
largely considered to be mainly of geometrical nature. Even Kelvin’s deﬁnition of chirality
concerns mainly the geometric shape of a body, regardless of its physical properties. For this
very reason it becomes necessary to point out possible physical aspects of chirality and this
becomes one of the main motivations of the present article. A physical body may contain
in it various diﬀerent materials. It may also contain diﬀerent properties such as colors or
magnetic structure. All these are not considered as realistic from geometric view point.
Such properties may have physical aspects and they form the basis for what is referred to as
“Physical chirality”. A body that contains this property of physical chirality may operate
in a perculiar mode that diﬀers considerably from a regular mode of operation of an achiral
body. The source of such an operation comes from a speciﬁc type of interaction that exists
between various mechanical devices and diﬀerent media such as ﬂow of air or water and
even light radiation. What is special about this type of interaction is the presence of chiral
structure in these devices which makes their mode of operation quite diﬀerent from other
interactions which are based on achiral objects such as the Newtonian mass point. Such an
interaction is to be labeled “chiral interaction” (CI) and it has already been described and
treated in several publications.5−7 It is important to note that this phenomenon of physical
chirality is largely being ignored and overlooked in classical mechanics, and many physicists
are quite unaware of its physical signiﬁcance in the domain of biophysics.

2 Chiral Interaction in Mechanical Devices

As mentioned above, chiral interaction is not limited to molecular structure only, but there
exist various mechanical chiral devices that function according to the same principle. The
most obvious chiral device is the rotating water sprinkler (see Fig. 1). When the water
stream enters the sprinkler it “knows” immediately in which direction to rotate. This is so
due to its chiral structure. What is rotating in the opposite direction is the mirror image
of the given sprinkler. Let us deﬁne now by D and L the “enantiomers” of the rotating
sprinkler according to its direction of rotation being clock or anti clockwise, respectively.
Another common chiral device is the windmill. When wind blows at the vanes of the mill it
also “knows” instantly to which direction to rotate. This is due to its chiral design. If it did
contain reﬂection symmetry with respect to its axis of rotation, it “would not know” to which
direction to rotate. The next example, shown in Fig. 2, is somewhat more sophisticated,
and it depends on a diﬀerent mode of chirality. This device is a simple variant of the
Crookes’ radiometer. The active medium in this case is light radiation. The element of
chirality here consists of two diﬀerent colors on both sides of the rotating blades, being black
and silver, respectively. This is a special example of a physical rather than of a geometric
chirality. From a pure geometric sense of view this radiometer contains a complete reﬂection
symmetry and, therefore, it can be regarded as achiral. Physical chirality7,8 is presented
by the chiral distribution of a physical property rather than by a chiral geometric shape.

Physical chirality diﬀers from a geometric one in its capability of interacting with various
media surrounding it. In the case of this special example of a variant of the ordinary Crookes’
radiometer, the physical distribution of the black and silver colors on the blades represents
a large diﬀerence in the light absorption coeﬃcient of the blades. The silver side reﬂects
back the light, whereas the black side absorbs the light and therefore becomes warmer in
comparison to the silver one. This causes the air close to the black side to become heated,
and as a result it expands and pushes back the black side, which ends up in rotating the
device in the preferred direction of the black side of the blade. The selection of the sense of
rotation of the blades is made by the variance of colors on the blades and their interaction
with light. The concept of physical chirality7−8 here is represented by the distribution of the
optical absorption coeﬃcient on the blades and not by their geometric shape.

Figure 1: (A) Two rotating water sprinklers are shown as examples of chiral devices. The
sprinkler rotating in clock-wise direction when looking at it from above is marked by D and
its mirror image by L. At the bottom, both sprinklers are shown from above. These provide
for an excellent example of time irreversible macro chiral device.
(B) At the bottom it
is shown that by reversing the direction of the ﬂow of water, the vectorial diﬀerence of the
water ﬂow momentum at the bending of the sprinkler, does still rotate the sprinkler in the
same direction. This is why the rotating water sprinkler is space-time (ST)-invariant.

One of the main objectives for carefully analyzing the action of chiral mechanical device is
to point out a certain unusual result that is derived from their operation. The choice of only
one direction of rotation by these devices is not readily acceptable in classical mechanics.
Actually, the meaning of this mode of operation is that chiral interaction does not obey
time-reversible invariance. By reversing the direction of motion of the interacting media,
such as the ﬂow of water in the sprinkler (see Fig. 1), or the direction of the light radiation
in the case of the radiometer (see Fig. 2), the direction of rotation of the devices does not
change, it remains the same. This is the main eﬀect of chirality in these cases. What does
rotate in the opposite direction is the mirror-image of each of these chiral devices. This
eﬀect happened also to irritate Richard Feynman who tried to reverse the direction of ﬂow
of water in the sprinkler and caused a ﬂood in his laboratory at Los Alamos. Actually, by
looking carefully at the bending of the sprinkler, where the direction of the momentum of
the water is varying and it creates an angular momentum to the sprinkler with respect to its
axis. It can now be readily deduced that the diﬀerence in the water momentum will create
the same direction of angular momentum, regardless of which side the water is ﬂowing from
(see Fig. 1).

Figure 2: A variant of Crookes’ radiometer is an example of the operation of chiral interaction
(CI). The asymmetry in the optical absorption coeﬃcient between the black and the silver
blades generates a temperature diﬀerence between them when light is shining at the device.
This expands the air on the side of the black blade which, in turn, pushes it around the
axis AB in the preferred direction towards the black vane. This is an example of a physical
rather than of a geometric chirality where the chirality is in the colors of the blades and not
in their geometric shape.

A similar conclusion is derived from the action of the radiometer. It always rotates in
the direction of the black blade regardless of the direction from which the light is shining at.
In what follows this phenomenon is further treated on.

To summarize the main features of chiral interaction (CI) in mechanical-devices, let us
notice that in all these examples there exists a speciﬁc medium with which the chiral device
is interacting and this is always happening at an interface separating the device from the
active medium. The physical chirality is built into this very interface. CI is a process by
which energy is transferred from the active medium into the chiral device which causes a
rotational motion, being usually of mechanical nature. The most signiﬁcant aspect of the
chiral interaction process is its mode of selecting only one direction of rotation out of two
possible ones, which is to be attributed to the chiral nature of the device. The mirror
image of the given chiral device, interacting with the same medium, does produce the same
rotational motion in the opposite direction. This is to be regarded as a main feature of
chiral interaction.

The eﬀect of chiral interaction (CI) on a molecular level is less recognizable in comparison
to that of macro-chiral devices. The main reason for this is that CI occurs mainly within
the chiral system, or molecule, in the form of rather small perturbations which are not easy
to detect experimentally. In a recent experiment by Koumura et.al9 they observed also a
similar behavior of chiral interaction on a molecular level of “monodirectional molecular
rotor”. Much more recognizable are the physical eﬀects associated with molecular chiral
structure, such as optical activity and related eﬀects. These are to be regarded as “chiral
scattering”, rather than CI, since the observable eﬀect concerns the polarized light being
scattered away from the chiral molecule, rather than its eﬀect on the molecule itself which
is intrinsic and cannot be readily detectable. This is chiral interaction7.

A physical model of chiral interaction (CI) in soluble proteins and amino-acids has al-

ready been developed and described in detail in several
publications5−7,10−12. The description here contains only a few main features of this model.
The active medium in this model consists of a random motion of ions, including protons,
throughout the solvent, being mostly regular water. The chiral element that interacts with
these ions is an electric dipole moment that exists in the protein structure. This interaction
causes a moving ion to be deﬂected away from its original track of motion, which creates
a continuous perturbation along the α-helix of which the proteins consist, and this pertur-
bation moves along the helix in one preferred direction out of two possible ones. Such
a perturbation of each ion is energetically rather small, but they add up together for the
whole protein molecule and become comparable to the size of thermal energy. This is an
abbreviated description of the model of CI that occurs in soluble proteins. A more detailed
description appears in earlier publications.5−7,10−12 The perturbation resulting from this CI
is of electric nature, rather than a mechanical one. Another interesting aspect of this CI is
that it is happening at an interface separating the interior of the protein molecule from the
solvent. This is due to the globular structure of the soluble protein. It is well known that
all soluble proteins become globular before they can function as enzymes13.

As mentioned above chiral interaction is not easy to observe experimentally on a molec-
ular level due to the small size of this eﬀect. Nevertheless, there exists a certain strong
supporting evidence for its existence owing to an experiment performed by Careri et al.14.
This experiment concerns the eﬀect of dehydration on the protonic, or ionic, motion through-

5

out the hydration layers surrounding soluble proteins. The amount of water around each
protein is crucial for free protonic motion around the molecule, which is also crucial for chiral
interaction. By dehydrating these water layers, a level is being reached when protonic mo-
tion becomes awkward and stops, and so does also, simultaneously, the enzymatic activity
of the protein molecule. On re-hydrating the molecule, protonic motion becomes possible
again and this, in turn, causes also the onset of enzymatic activity of the protein molecule.
This experiment shows14 that free ionic motion around soluble protein molecules, which is a
necessary condition for chiral interaction, is also necessary for their enzymatic activity.

3 Physical Aspects and Biological Signiﬁcance

The main objective of the present article is to draw several physical conclusions from the
phenomenon of chiral interaction in macro-chiral devices, which are quite diﬀerent from the
regular rules that exist in classical mechanics. The source of these diﬀerences arises from
the presence of physical chirality as a major feature, instead of the achiral environment that
plays a basic role in classical mechanics. From these conclusions analogies can be drawn for
the function of molecular chiral systems, which may well be of considerable signiﬁcance in
molecular biology.

The ﬁrst conclusion concerns the symmetry operation of time-reversibility that exists in
many examples of classical physics. As mentioned before, in the case of chiral interaction
time-reversibility cannot be conserved. The rotating water sprinkler, rotates about its axis in
a single preferred direction due to its chiral design. What is rotating in the opposite direction
is the mirror-image of the given sprinkler. The meaning of this mode of symmetry operation
is that a rotating water sprinkler is not time-reversible, but it obeys space-time invariance.
The meaning of this conclusion is not very common in classical mechanics. The reason for
this is that the physical nature of chirality has not been so far well recognized and treated
in mechanics. In particular, the fact that it does not obey time invariance. As shown before,
this can be readily deduced by a simple momentum consideration for the operation of a
rotating water sprinkler. The vectorial velocity of the stream of water changes its direction
at the bending of the sprinkler, and the momentum change caused by this is transferred to
the sprinkler, which determines the sense of rotation of the sprinkler (see Fig. 1). Upon
“reversing” time, the stream of water “reverses” its direction of ﬂow. Let us now analyze
brieﬂy the situation if the stream of water reverses, its direction of ﬂow. Let ~v1 and ~v2 be
the velocity vectors of the original ﬂow of water before and behind the sprinkler bending,
respectively, and ∆~v = ~v1 − ~v2 be the change in these velocities, which is proportional to
the momentum transfer to the sprinkler. Now let ~u1 and ~u2 be the opposite velocities,
respectively, upon reversing the direction of the water stream. It is obvious that ~u1 = −~v2
and ~u2 = −~v1. Let ∆~u = ~u1 − ~u2, then

∆u = ~u1 − ~u2 = (−~v2) − (−~v1) = ~v1 − ~v2 = ∆~v

(1)

which proves that the change of velocity at the sprinkler bending remains the same regardless
of the water ﬂow reversal. This is also shown in detail in Fig. 1. A similar situation exists
also for the rotating radiometer. No matter from which direction the light is shining, at its
blade, it does rotate always in the direction of the black wing owing to the existing physical

6

situation. Such a behavior does not obey time reversal invariance, but rather space-time
invariance. Let us now express the space-time inversion by S and T , respectively:
then a
rotating water sprinkler does obey the ST-invariance. The same is true for all the examples
given here of macro-chiral devices. The same is also true for the protein molecule example. A
similar rule of PT-invariance (or CPT invariance) is recognized in physics due to the presence
of a spin in quantum mechanics, but it is absent in classical physics because the concept
of physical chirality has been so far completely overlooked at. In particular, its mechanical
aspects. This concept of chirality appears much more in chemistry due to the presence of
many chiral molecules in organic compounds, but chirality is mostly regarded and treated in
chemistry in terms of geometric shape, rather than in its physical properties and contents.
For this reason the concept of chiral interaction has so far been largely ignored in researches
concerning chirality.

Such space-time symmetry operations for chiral devices may contain also a certain aspect
of practicality. This is so in contrast to their presence in the domain of elementary particles
in physics. From this view point any time-reversible process is almost completely useless from
any aspect of practicality. For instance, any machine operation that produces a certain func-
tion or object, or any information transfer process, are completely time-irreversible. These
include also biomolecular functions such as enzymatic activity and other processes which are
totally time-irreversible. For such reasons of practicality, the function of chiral devices, or
molecules, may be of special signiﬁcance in comparison to time reversible phenomena.

The next consideration involves the mode of selection, where only one direction of rota-
tion is excited by chiral interaction, whereas the opposite direction remains largely inactive.
Judging it from a thermodynamical aspect, what is happening here is that only one half
of the energy that can be activated by the device is excited by CI, whereas the other half
remains mostly inactive. On a molecular level this means that only one half of the energy
states of the system that are populated by CI become active, whereas the other half remain
relatively empty.
In other words, the system does not readily reach thermal equilibrium.
This conclusion is of very substantial and signiﬁcant meaning for living systems because
reaching thermal equilibriuim practically means death.

Another way of looking at this eﬀect is from the view-point of ergodicity. This concept
was introduced by Boltzmann about a century ago, and it considers the mode of approaching
thermal equilibrium of a single particle. This is done as a process of time average, instead of
a statistical average of a large ensemble of particles. In view of this, the average velocity of
such a particle, in any given direction, approaches zero as a function of time. This is not the
case if, for instance, the average angular velocity of a rotating water sprinkler is regarded as
a function of time. This is, actually, true for any eﬀect of CI, when averaged as a function
of time. The selection of one direction of motion out of two possible ones, which is typical
of CI, makes its mode of motion to become a non-ergodic entity, which again causes it to
avoid thermal equilibrium. This property of CI on a microscopic level is, apparently, one of
the most crucial advantages that chirality, or CI, does contribute to molecular biology. It
does postpone thermal equilibrium, or death, for a considerable length of time, so that the
biological function of these molecules can go on and not be aﬀected by approaching thermal
equilibrium.

In this context it is signiﬁcant to mention also Schr¨odinger, who became interested in the
phenomenon of life and wrote a book15 “What is Life?” in 1944. His main conclusion in this

7

book was: “It feeds on negative entropy”. This expression becomes also quite appropriate
for the function of physical chirality and this is the reason for borrowing it as part of the
title of the present article. This is exactly what chiral interaction is performing in its mode
of selecting only one direction of motion. Such a mode of activity reduces considerably the
entropy of the system. In relation to the phenomenon of non-ergodicity it is also important to
mention its relevance to the process of evolution, which is crucial in biology. It is reasonable
to deduce that systems that reach readily thermal equilibrium never do undergo the process
of evolution and remain basically unchanged forever. Non-ergodic molecular systems have a
better chance to undergo evolutionary changes.

4 Discussion and Conclusions

Another aspect of chiral interaction regards the nature of this eﬀect, as well as the size
In discussing this case it is not relevant to
of energy that is involved in such a process.
consider macro-chiral devices, and our main concern is chiral interaction of biomolecular
systems. Unfortunately, our knowledge at present, of this eﬀect is quite limited and this is
mainly because of the small amount of energy involved in this eﬀect, which is quite diﬃcult
to observe experimentally. This may evoke criticism as to its possible signiﬁcance. Such
a criticism is rather common among scientists who tend to attribute signiﬁcance to energy
according to its size. What may be much more signiﬁcant than the amount of energy
involved in living processes, is its quality, or degree of sophistication. This is particularly so
in complex systems such as certain biomolecules, proteins for example. The feature of time-
irreversibility of CI does contribute a degree of sophistication to the activity of biomolecules.
In addition to this, there exist quite a few examples of highly sophisticated modes of energy
which do require rather minute quantities of energy. For instance, an information transfer
process requires a high degree of sophistication in wave modulation, but its size of energy
is relatively small. In comparison, boiling a kettle of water requires much more energy, but
what is its degree of sophistication? Another example is the small amount of energy required
to switch on and oﬀ a much larger source of energy. This example can be regarded as a mode
of control mechanism energy, which may also be the of signiﬁcance to CI in biology. Another,
rather cruel example, concerns the magnitude of energy change that occurs over a short time
interval during which a creature ceases to live. The change in energy is rather small but its
signiﬁcance is very impressive. In these examples and many others, the amount of energy
involved in their performance is of little interest, but their main eﬀect is in their degree of
sophistication.

The experiment of Koumura et al.9 is a signiﬁcant and important progress on a molec-
ular level. This is the ﬁrst successful proof that a monodirectional molecular rotor can be
fabricated. The chiral interaction leading to this operation is based on light radiation. This
experiment supplies for a beginning of support for the assumption of non-ergodic nature of
chiral interaction on a molecular level, being the basis for its negative entropy and therefore
for its avoiding readily thermodynamical equilibrium. In addition to this there exists also
the analysis of behavior of globular proteins5−7,10−12 which also react in a monodirectional
manner. The experiment of Careri et al.13 provides for a supporting evidence for the signif-
icance of CI in the enzymatic activity of proteins. It is quite reasonable to assume that in

biology, or in any living substance, the presence of such modes of highly sophisticated and
low energy signals may have an important function in its life process.

In conclusion, let us mention again the signiﬁcance and importance of the phenomenon
of chirality in biology. In particular the features of chiral interaction (CI) that diﬀer largely
from those of classical physics that do not contain chiral structures in their interactions.
These include the ST-invariance of chiral interaction, which causes it to be time-irreversible.
The selectivity nature of CI by preferring one mode of motion out of two possible ones,
enables CI to become non-ergodic (or, more speciﬁcally, to delay considerably its reaching
thermal equilibrium), which is a crucial element in life processes and biological evolution. In
other words: “it feeds on negative entropy”, as Schroedinger wrote in his book.

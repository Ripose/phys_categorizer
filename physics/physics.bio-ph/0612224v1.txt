Abstract. The local opening of DNA is an intriguing phenomenon from a statistical physics point of
view, but is also essential for its biological function. For instance, the transcription and replication of our
genetic code can not take place without the unwinding of the DNA double helix. Although these biological
processes are driven by proteins, there might well be a relation between these biological openings and the
spontaneous bubble formation due to thermal ﬂuctuations. Mesoscopic models, like the Peyrard-Bishop-
Dauxois model, have fairly accurately reproduced some experimental denaturation curves and the sharp
phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. It is, hence, tempting to see whether these models could be
used to predict the biological activity of DNA. In a previous study, we introduced a method that allows
to obtain very accurate results on this subject, which showed that some previous claims in this direction,
based on molecular dynamics studies, were premature. This could either imply that the present PBD
should be improved or that biological activity can only be predicted in a more complex frame work that
involves interactions with proteins and super helical stresses. In this article, we give detailed description
of the statistical method introduced before. Moreover, for several DNA sequences, we give a thorough
analysis of the bubble-statistics as function of position and bubble size and the so-called l-denaturation
curves that can be measured experimentally. These show that some important experimental observations
are missing in the present model. We discuss how the present model could be improved.

1 Introduction

The process of DNA denaturation has intrigued both bi-
ologists as statistical physicists. Large openings, the so-
called DNA bubbles are supposed to allow the formation
of some speciﬁc DNA structures, such as the T-loop that
stabilizes the end of the chromosomes. The opening of the
DNA double helix is also a mandatory step for the tran-
scription and the replication of the genetic code. In ad-
dition, the bonds between bases on opposite strands can
break due to thermal ﬂuctuations which can occur even
at room or physiological temperatures. These thermally
induced DNA bubbles can be several base-pairs long and
tend to increase at higher temperatures, which eventu-
ally results in the complete denaturation or the melting
of DNA. An intriguing question we could ask ourselves is
how the formation of bubbles depend on the base-pair spe-
ciﬁc sequence and how thermally induced bubbles relate
to biophysical DNA unwinding mechanisms that are in-
volved in the transcription and replication. Although these
biological processes are driven by proteins, the intrinsic
ﬂuctuations of DNA itself might play an important role.
Hence, one could even question whether biological active

sites could be predicted by thermally induced bubbles in
absence of any proteins [1,2,3].

Experimentally, the thermally induced denaturation
can be monitored as the breaking of the base-pairs is ac-
companied with a large increase of UV absorbance near
260 nm. In fact, the UV absorbance measures the reduc-
tion of base-pairing and -stacking when the DNA molecule
denaturates. Using this technique, it was found that large
synthetical fabricated homopolymers denaturate suddenly
within a very small temperature interval [4]. This indicates
that the process resembles a true ﬁrst order phase transi-
tion. On the other hand, natural heterogeneous DNA poly-
mers denaturate in multiple steps and the shape of this
denaturation curve is highly sensitive to the sequence [5].
It is known that this process is not only determined by
the fraction of strong (GC) or weak (AT) bonds. The se-
quence speciﬁc order is also important. Speciﬁc sequences
can reveal a high opening rate despite a high fraction
of GC base-pairs [6]. Besides the already mentioned UV
absorbance experiments, many ingenious techniques have
been devised to study the denaturation process and the
statistical and dynamical properties of DNA bubbles in
general. For instance, Raman vibrational spectroscopy [7,8],

neutron scattering [9], ﬂuorescent correlated spectroscopy [10],
and S1-nuclease cleavage [1] have recently put forward as
promising experimental tools to gain insight in the com-
plex mechanism of DNA denaturation.

In general, despite this signiﬁcant progress, the experi-
mental techniques reveal only indirect information. Hence,
complementary computational and theoretical studies are
often a requisite to complete the interpretation of exper-
imental data. This is, however, diﬃcult due to the astro-
nomical large number of atoms that are needed to describe
solvated DNA. Besides the number of atoms of DNA itself,
a suﬃciently large number of water molecules and counter
ions should be included. Any full-atom approach is hence-
forth limited to very short DNA sequences and, for the
longest sequences that can be studied, meaningful bubble
statistics cannot be obtained. This has created need for
mesoscopic theoretical models that allow to study long
DNA sequences of hundreds or even thousands of base-
pairs [11,12,13,14,15,16]. While most of these models try
to mimic the system by an Ising-like model, the Peyrard-
Bishop-Dauxois model [15,16] (PBD) relies on a continu-
ous approach using an eﬀective force-ﬁeld as function of
the base-pair separation. Although more complicated than
the Ising type models, the PBD model has the advantage
that it can describe the DNA sequence in a more detailed
manner than just a simple array of open and closed states
and it allows to study dynamics as well. An important
essence of the PBD model is the nonlinear stacking in-
teraction which reproduces the experimentally measured
sharp phase transition of long homopolymers [16]. More-
over, the model, parameterized for heterogeneous DNA
chains, has given accurate results for denaturation curves
of short heterogeneous DNA sequences [17]. Although the
PBD model is a very strong simpliﬁcation of the actual
DNA molecule in solution, the qualitative and even quan-
titative agreement with numerous experimental ﬁndings
have given conﬁdence to this model and to its theoretical
results for which yet no direct experimental information
is available.

It were these ﬁndings that inspired Choi et al. [1,2] to
compare the signal of S1 nuclease cleavage experiments
with the formation of bubbles of a certain size obtained
from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of PBD model.
The detection of bubbles at a certain size requires the
identiﬁcation of conﬁgurations that contain series of con-
secutive open base-pairs which is very diﬃcult to accom-
plish experimentally. Still, as argued in [1], the S1 nuclease
enzymes can selectively cleave the large temporary open-
ings while leaving the smaller openings intact, hindered
by their own physical size. The amount of cleavages at
certain positions in the DNA chain results in a signal that
becomes visible after a certain time of incubation (about
45 min. [1]). The obtained S1 nuclease signal showed a re-
markable correspondence with the calculated probability
proﬁle for bubbles containing ten or more base-pairs from
the MD simulations of the PBD model [1]. Moreover, both
experimental and theoretical graphs showed clear dom-
inant peaks around the Transcription Start Site (TSS)
where the biological transcription is initiated. A similar re-

sult had been reported by Benham et al. [18,19,20,21,22]
who also found a connection between bubble formation
and regulatory loci using a theoretical model. However,
there are two crucial diﬀerences between the work of Ben-
ham et al. and Choi et al. First, the methodology of Ben-
ham et al. is speciﬁed to detect very large openings upto
100 base-pairs in kilobase sequences, while the work of
Choi et al. investigates much smaller openings
10 in
sequences of the order
100 base-pairs. The second and
most important diﬀerence is that work of Benham studies
the bubbles in vivo which includes torsional eﬀects that
are generated by other molecules. The apparent evidence
of Choi [1] suggested that spontaneous bubbles in vitro al-
ready bear the signature of biological activity. A remark-
able result that was summarized by the statement: DNA
directs its own transcription [1].

∼

Unfortunately, this statement had to be reconsidered
due to more accurate results by us [3] using a direct in-
tegration method that is orders-of-magnitude faster than
MD. An important diﬃculty with MD or Monte Carlo is
that large bubbles appear only seldom so that the statisti-
cal signiﬁcance can be questioned even for very long sim-
ulation periods. Our accurate results did not support the
previously found results at some crucial points. As in [1],
they indicated that bubbles might appear more easily in
the biological active sites due to its higher content of AT
as compared to a random sequence. However, contrary
to [1], the most dominant peak did not appear at the TSS
for the sequences under study nor did the promoter se-
quences have a much higher opening proﬁle as compared
to biologically inactive sequences. Hence, the statistical
information on bubbles obtained by the PBD model was
found to be insuﬃcient to make very accurate predictions
on transcription start sites or to discriminate between pro-
moter sequences and biologically inactive sequences as was
suggested before [1,2]. This leaves open the following pos-
sibilities: (i) either the transcription sites cannot be pre-
dicted by the information on thermally induced bubbles
alone but require more complex interactions including, for
instance, superhelical stress, or (ii) the bubble hypothesis
of Choi et al. still holds, as suggested by the S1 nucle-
ase experiments, but a more accurate theoretical model is
needed to support these ﬁndings.

The main subject of this article is to give a detailed
description of the direct integration method introduced
in [3] and to show some examples of the calculated bub-
ble statistics for some biologically active and inactive se-
quences. We will also investigate the validity of the PBD
model by applying this method to calculate quantities
that allow a more direct comparison with experiments.
This article is organized as follows: we will ﬁrst give a
short introduction to the PBD model in Sec. 2, followed
by a theoretical discussion on what we will call the dou-
ble stranded DNA ensemble (dsDNAE) in Sec. 3. The
latter is needed to give meaningful results when apply-
ing the PBD model to ﬁnite chains. Then, in Sec. 4, we
give some important deﬁnitions concerning the bubble
statistics of DNA expressed in microscopic terms such
that it can be calculated by computer experiments. In

Sec. 5 we introduce the direct integration method includ-
ing all the technicalities involved. This derivation results
in an algorithm that implies a repetitive numerical in-
tegration scheme using a Newton-Cotes rule. The eﬃ-
ciency of several Newton-Cotes schemes, such as rectan-
gular, trapezoidal, Simpson’s 1
3 -rule, Boole’s rule, and 11-
point Newton-Cotes rule, are examined and compared in
Appendix A. In Sec. 6 we show some numerical results of
the bubble probability proﬁles of a biologically active pro-
moter sequence and two artiﬁcial Fibonacci sequences. We
conﬁrm the previous ﬁndings: there is no enhanced open-
ing at transcription start sites or at promoter sequences
in comparison to biologically inactive sites and sequences
that have a similar (local) AT content. Then, in Sec. 7
we investigate the validity of the PBD model using the di-
rect integration method to calculate l-denaturation curves
which can be measured experimentally by the recently
introduced quenching technique[23,24,25]. These results
clearly indicate that some essential ingredients are miss-
ing in the present PBD model. This implies that the PBD
model should be improved and that the bubble hypothesis
of Choi et al. could still hold when an ’ideal theoretical
model’ is considered. In Sec. 8, we end with a general dis-
cussion and make some suggestion that could lead to an
improved theoretical model.

the stacking interaction drops from K ′ = K(1 + ρ) down
to K ′ = K whenever either yk or yk−1 becomes signiﬁ-
cant larger than α−1. It is thanks to this additional term
that the observed sharp phase transition in denaturation
experiments [4] can be reproduced. It is important to note
the + sign in Eq. (2). This makes the stacking potential
W (yk, yk−1) not a simple function of the relative distance
. It was found that, after replacing e−α(yk+yk−1)
yk −

with e−α|yk−yk−1| in Eq. (2), the denaturation transition
becomes continuous again as in the original PB model [26].
However, Eq. (2) is surely not the only possible possi-
ble potential that can reproduce the sharp transition. Re-
cently, an alternative potential W (yk, yk−1) was suggested
in [27] which also seems to generate a sharp denaturation
and only depends
. This shows that reproduc-
yk−1|
ing experimental curves alone is deﬁnitely not enough to
uniquely determine the eﬀective potentials. Interpretation
of the physical mechanism that lead to the sharp denat-
uration transition is a prerequisite for the justiﬁcation of
the eﬀective models. The discussion of this mechanism is
deﬁnitely not completely settled, but the argumentation
that relies in the PBD model seems very plausible, as the
ρ-term mimics the eﬀect of decreasing overlap between π
electrons when one of two neighboring base move out of
stack.

2 The PBD model

The PBD model reduces the myriad degrees of freedom of
DNA to a one-dimensional chain of eﬀective atom com-
pounds describing the relative base-pair separations yk
from the ground state positions. The total potential en-
ergy U for an N base-pair DNA chain is then given by

The ﬁrst term Vk is the on site Morse potential describing
the hydrogen bond interaction between bases on opposite
strands. Dk and ak determine the depth and width of the
Morse potential and are diﬀerent for the weak AT and
strong GC base-pair. The stacking potential W consists
of a harmonic and a nonlinear term. An important reason
for the success of this model lies in the ρ-term which was
introduced in [16] as an improvement upon the original
Peyrard-Bishop (PB) model [15]. This original PB model
can be retrieved by taking ρ = 0. The precise analytical
shape of W (yk, yk−1) in Eq. (2) is not crucial. What is im-
portant is that for ρ > 0, the eﬀective coupling constant of

After modeling homogeneous DNA, Campa and Gi-
ansanti generalized the PBD model for the heterogeneous
case [17,28]. The in total 7 parameters K = 0.025 eV/˚A2,
ρ = 2, α = 0.35 ˚A−1, Dw = 0.05 eV, Ds = 0.075 eV,
aw = 4.2 ˚A−1, as = 6.9 ˚A−1, were derived by ﬁtting to
experimental denaturation curves of short heterogeneous
DNA segments. The subscripts w and s refer to the type of
base-pair at site k in Eq. (2). Here, Dw and aw are used
for the weak AT base-pairs and Ds and as are used for
the strong GC base-pairs. The ratio between Dw and Ds
reﬂects the ratio between the number of hydrogen bonds
forming the AT and GC base-pair bonding. In fact, the
reason to ﬁx this ratio is not really justiﬁed as the depth
of the Morse potential does not only reﬂect the hydrogen
bond linking (which is in the order of 0.2 eV per hydrogen
bond), but also the repulsive interactions of the phosphate
groups and the eﬀect of the solvent. Still, the absolute and
relative magnitude of the eﬀective weak and strong inter-
actions seem to be more or less correct as this parame-
terization could reproduce the experimental denaturation
curves of several short DNA sequences as tested in [17,28].

Despite these accomplishments, it is also important to
realize the limitations of the model. The PBD model treats
the A and T bases and the G and C bases as identical ob-
jects. The stacking interaction W (yk, yk−1) is also inde-
pendent of the nature of the bases at site k and k
1. Ex-
perimental measurements [29,30,31] and theoretical calcu-
lations [32,33,34,35,36] have shown that these are rather
crude approximations. Future work might aim to improve
upon this.

3 The dsDNA ensemble

In this section we will assert the need of special ensemble
that we will call the double stranded DNA ensemble (ds-
DNAE) and we will give its mathematical deﬁnition. The
reason that we will not use the full NVT or NVE ensemble
is because the results based on the PBD model have not
much meaning in these ensembles whenever ﬁnite DNA
chains are considered. The original papers using the PBD
model were all performed in the thermodynamic limit of
an inﬁnite DNA chain where this problem does not ap-
pear. It is in this limit that one can show, using the trans-
fer integral technique [37], that the uniform PBD-DNA se-
quence undergoes a very sharp phase transition [38] upon
heating, which is ﬁrst order except in a cross over region
near the transition temperature that is so narrow that it
is not accessible to experiments. The diﬃculty of ﬁnite se-
quences is that PBD model basically represents a single
DNA chain in an inﬁnite solution. Hence, whenever the
dsDNA completely separates, the two strands are free to
go to very large separations without cost of energy due to
the plateau of the Morse potential. In experiments, where
the amount of solvated DNA is not inﬁnitely diluted, this
eﬀect is counterbalanced by the hybridization mechanism
where two single stranded chains in solution come together
and match their complementary bases. This implies that,
per deﬁnition, the PBD model cannot reproduce the ex-
perimental data, which are based on ﬁnite concentrations,
using equilibrium statistics in the full phase space. A con-
ﬁnement of the phase space is always necessary. These
can be done hiddenly using a series of reasonable short
MD [16,39,27] or Monte Carlo [40] simulations starting
from a certain distribution of initial conﬁgurations. Here,
the ﬁnite simulation length prohibit the boundless explo-
ration of the completely separated states. However, this
strategy will naturally generate results that depend on the
choice of initial conditions and the simulation length which
is not completely under control especially at tempera-
tures near the melting transition [16,39]. Alternatively,
one could restrict conﬁguration space by adding an in-
ﬁnite wall such that yk for all k cannot exceed a certain
maximum value [41] or by adding a small positive slope to
the plateau of the Morse potential [38]. These approaches
still allow for complete denaturation and recombination of
the two strands, but prevent separations of very large dis-
tances. This recombination, however, is quite artiﬁcial as
the one-dimensional model does not allow for misfolding,
the creation of bulge-loops [42] or the recombination with
a diﬀerent strand in solution. Therefore, we chose to focus
to these conﬁgurations only that belong to the dsDNAE
that we will introduce here. In microscopic terms, a con-
is called a double stranded DNA (dsDNA)
ﬁguration
molecule when yk < ξ for at least one k
[1 : N ] with
ξ the opening threshold deﬁnition. Similarly, a conﬁgura-
tion is completely denaturated whenever yk > ξ for all k.
All conﬁgurations assigned as dsDNA together with their
corresponding Boltzmann-weight comprise the dsDNAE.

To shorten the notation we have dropped the yk depen-
dencies. In Eq. (6), µ = 1 except when all bases are open;
then µ = 0. The dsDNAE removes all diﬃculties con-
cerning the unnormalizability of the full phase space equi-
librium distribution. Besides the opening threshold deﬁni-
tion ξ, it does not add any new (hidden) parameters to the
PBD model as in previous examples. At temperatures suf-
ﬁciently below the denaturation transition, the dsDNAE
gives a good representation of the actual experimental sit-
uation where only a fraction of the DNA is in the single
stranded state. It is reasonably simple to use MD in the
dsDNAE using a biasing-potential, e.g. [3]

V bias(ymin) =

with ymin = MIN[

This bias yields an additional force to the system that is
always zero except when the dsDNA is at the point of
complete denaturation. Then it gives a strong repulsion
to the last closed base to prevent the complete opening of
the whole molecule. Although, MD is certainly much less
eﬃcient than the direct integration method expressed in
Sec. 5, MD using the biasing force (7) can still be useful for
calculating properties that do not allow the factorization
necessary for the integration method or dynamical prop-
erties. At higher temperatures, the contributions of sin-
gle stranded DNA, to e.g. UV absorbance, can no longer
be neglected. Luckily, recent experimental techniques al-
low to selectively subtract the contributions of the single

stranded molecules to the signal [23,24,25] such that, ef-
fectively, the dsDNA signal can be obtained. Hence, also
at higher temperatures, the theoretical PBD calculations
using dsDNAE can be compared with experimental re-
sults.

It is an interesting mathematical problem why the
complete separation does not disturb the thermodynamic
case. In fact, this can be understood invoking one-dimensional
random walk theory. This reveals that, for a ﬁxed conﬁgu-
ration of the inﬁnite DNA chain, one should always meet
a closed base-pair when making a walk in one direction
along the chain 1. Hence, µ is always 1 for the inﬁnite
case and, thus, the inﬁnite chain remains in the dsDNAE
at all times. It is important to note that, therefore, the
constraint to keep always one base-pair closed, does not
destroy the phase transition. On contrary, the additional
constraint allows to study thermodynamic limit using ﬁ-
nite approximants in a much more controlled way. Fig. 1
shows the denaturation curves of ﬁnite homopolymers of
increasing length. The results was obtained by the direct

any bias had much more diﬃculty to determine the denat-
uration temperature due to huge variations in the melting
region despite the use of very long sequences upto 16384
base-pairs [39].

Eq. (8,9) obey the relation l = (f
l is sometimes called the average fractional bubble length.
However, this is not completely true as more than one bub-
ble may occur simultaneously in the same sequence. For
the inﬁnite case, we have f = l and p = 0 as explained
in Sec. 3. However, we cannot reproduce the experimental
f (T ) and p(T ) curves for ﬁnite chains as we have, strictly
speaking, f (T ) = p(T ) = 1 at all temperatures in the
PBD model. Therefore, we will focus on the behavior of
l(T ) which can be measured by the quenching technique of
Zocchi and co-workers [23,24,25]. Indirectly, f (T ) could be
obtained from l(T ) using the phenomenological approach
of Campa and Giansanti [17]. This approach, however, re-
quires two additional parameters that have to be ﬁtted to
experiments. Therefore, we believe that the calculation of
l(T ) gives the most direct comparison with experimental
data.

Of course, the experimental UV absorbance signal can-
not be literally related to the fraction of open base-pairs as
it is not a binary type measurement that detects whether
the base is open or closed. Moreover, the theoretical def-
inition of ’open’ and ’close’ is a bit ambiguous as it de-
pends on the choice of opening threshold ξ. Still, it is
known that the UV absorbance changes quite abruptly
when bases move out of stack, which validates the θ-like
expressions (8) and (9). Moreover, it was found that, at
least, the qualitative aspects of the theoretical denatura-
tion curve are not too sensitive to ξ when chosen within
[1 ˚A: 2 ˚A] ) . Nevertheless, the

of the stacking state of a base pair and, hence, cannot be

Besides denaturation curves, the statistical method in-
troduced in Ref. [3] allows to study bubbles of a given size.
The importance to study bubbles of a given size was sug-

S1 nuclease cleavage experiments and possibly could tell
more about its biological function than the mean

it is a bit arbitrary where to place the center, but we
deﬁned it as the base directly to the left of the midpoint
of the bubble. The bubble probability matrix Pbub(k, m)
is, now, deﬁned as the probability to have a bubble of size

In principle, Pbub(k, m) contains all the information on
the bubble statistics in a DNA sequence. Still, it is use-
ful to calculate other quantities as well. From physical and
biological perspective, it might be useful to know the abil-
ity to participate in bubbles. Therefore, we introduce the
Ppart(k, m) probability which is the probability to partic-

In order to perform the numerical calculation, we need
to deﬁne some proper cut-oﬀs where we can stop the inte-

weight of a certain conﬁguration ̺ = e−βU(yN ) drops be-
low a certain threshold value ǫ. It is clear that the energy
diverges and, hence, ̺ vanishes whenever for a certain k
the position yk takes a very large negative value or when

This completes the set of cut-oﬀ values. In principle, the
cut-oﬀ d is not strictly necessary as L and R are suﬃ-
cient to start a numerical approach. However, the cut-oﬀ

siderably. To summarize, via Eq. (19-21) we have deﬁned
three cut-oﬀ values which restrict the conﬁguration space

6 bubble probability matrices

Now we have introduced the mathematical deﬁnitions con-
cerning the bubble statistics in Sec. 4 and derived the
numerical method to calculate these properties in Sec. 5
and Appendix A, we will apply this method to speciﬁc
sequences. In Ref. [3], we calculated the bubble probabil-
ity matrix (12) for de adeno-associated viral P5 promoter
(AAVP5) whose sequence is shown below

AAVP5: 5’- GTGGCCATTTAGGGTATATATGGCCG
AGTGAGCGAGCAGGATCTCCATTTTG
ACCGCGAAATTTGAACG-3’.

The TSS is shown by an underscore.

In Fig. 2, we show the same results as Ref. [3] for a
slightly diﬀerent threshold value (ξ = 1 ˚A instead of 1.5
˚A) together with the bubble partition matrix (13). As we
are not interested in the boundary eﬀects, we replicated
the chain at both ends, but only computed the statis-
tics for the middle chain. This eliminates the eﬀects of
the free ends, which, otherwise, would yield very large
opening probabilities at boundary sites [3]. We calculated
the bubble probability matrix (12) up to bubbles of size
m = 50 (only up to 30 is shown in Fig. 2) and the bubble
partition matrix from Eq. (13). Note that, for reasons of
visualization, we have applied for each row a normaliza-
tion approach in these two ﬁgures. The normalizing con-
stants, which are the maxima in each row, are depicted in
the panels below. Considering these results, one can see
that the probability for bubbles is approximately exponen-
tially decreasing as function of the bubble size. The bub-

on the time-scale accessible by MD. On the other hand,
the numerical integration method allows to obtain accu-
rate results for even much larger bubbles. This can be
important for the study of biological phenomena as, for
instance, transcription elongation involves DNA openings
that are larger than ten bases [44]. The method allows to
obtain accuracies of less than one percent error after only
a few hours of computation which would otherwise take
200 years when using MD [3].

Although Fig. 2 shows indeed somewhat enhanced open-

ing in the biologically active regions, it shows that it is
certainly not true that the TSS has a much higher open-
ing probability than the other sites as was found in the
foregoing less accurate MD results [1]. In fact, the -30 re-
gion shows equal probabilities for opening and and even
higher probabilities when bubbles of size
10 are con-
sidered. Inspection of the lowest rows in Fig. 2 basically
reﬂects the AT-rich parts of the sequence. The position of
the preferential opening for the larger bubbles can be rea-
sonably understood as a merging eﬀect; two small bubbles
that are close in distance act as the precursor of a larger
bubble whose center is in the middle of the two smaller

ones. The Ppart matrix has considerable less structure, but
shows the same tendency.

To investigate whether promoter sites are special in
terms of its bubble probability proﬁle, in Refs. [1,3] a hu-
man coding gene, known to be free of any protein interac-
tion sites, was examined. The initial results suggested that
this sequence had much lower probability for bubbles[1],
but the direct integration method showed that the ability
for bubble formation was certainly comparable in magni-
tude to the promoter sequences [3]. Here, we study two
other artiﬁcial non-promoter sequences. These are the fol-
lowing two complementary Fibonacci sequences:

Fibonacci-1: ACAACACAACAACACAACACAACAA
CACAACAACACAACACAACAACACA
ACACAACAACACAACAACACAACAC
AACAACACAACAAC

and

Fibonacci-2: CACCACACCACCACACCACACCACC
ACACCACCACACCACACCACCACAC
CACACCACCACACCACCACACCACA
CCACCACACCACCA

which have a total length of 89 and a AT content of 62
% and 38 % respectively. The choice for Fibonacci has
been made to analyze the hypothetical enhanced opening
of biological sequences in comparison with a “random” se-
quence. However, as a typical random sequence is poorly
deﬁned, one could come up with any sequence and basi-
cally “prove” what one wants. Therefore we studied the
Fibonacci sequences rather than two sequences produced
by a random number generator. Although those Fibonacci
sequences are far from random, they are suﬃciently disor-
dered and have the advantage that they doe not contain
very long weak or strong regions due consecutive repeti-
tions. In addition, we strictly rule out that the possibility
we pick by accident a sequence that is biologically active
as well.

and Ppart(k, 15) for the Fibonacci sequences together with
the results for the AAVP5 promoter. The ﬁrst panel shows
Ppart(k, 1) which equals the simple opening probability of
the individual base in the sequences. It shows that the pro-
moter sequence has some regions that have a considerably
higher aﬃnity to open up than the Fibonacci sequences.
This is a result of the presence of longer consecutive AT
regions in the AAVP5 promoter. The Fibonacci-1 and
Fibonacci-2 sequence have at most 2 or 1 consecutive weak
base-pairs in a row. When we examine larger bubbles, we
see that the base-speciﬁc order of the sequences becomes
less important. The extend of the bubble averages out the
eﬀect of the precise order of the weak and strong bases.
Hence, the openings probability proﬁle becomes more and
more determined by the AT content. This is clearly illus-
trated by the fact that the promoter sequence’s probabil-
ity proﬁle for bubbles of size 15 remains strictly within

the two proﬁles of the Fibonacci sequences at all sites.
Hence, the chance to ﬁnd a bubble of 15 is at each loca-
tion higher in the AT-rich Fibonacci sequence than in the
AAVP5 promoter, despite the absence of long series with
consecutive weak AT bases. This also suggest that the
bubble statistics, at least within the PBD framework, is
reasonably predictable by some simple rules based on the
AT content. Indeed, Rapti et al. [45,46] suggest that these
PBD bubble proﬁles could be qualitatively reproduced by
counting the number of AT-bases within a certain window
that is a bit larger than the bubble size considered. Ac-
tual DNA in solution seems to be less predictable on basis
of the AT content alone. The denaturation steps in long
heterogeneous DNA polymers are very sensitive to the se-
quence [5] and can qualitatively change when only one
base-pair is changed. The experimental part of Ref. [1] also
suggest that actual DNA bubble statistics retains strong
non-local eﬀects. A prerequisite for the understanding of
these result would require a more precise interpretation of
the measurements by the S1 nuclease cleavage technique
expressed in microscopic terms. The experimental signal
might well be related to some of the deﬁnitions (12) and
(13), but probably not straightforwardly. Many questions
remain such as which range of bubbles can be detected
by S1 nuclease cleavage, where in the bubble takes the
cleavage place, is bubble life-time important, and many
more. Much more systematic studies are needed. The re-
sults of Fig. 3 show that the study of artiﬁcial sequences,
such as the Fibonacci sequences, can reveal diﬀerent struc-
tures depending on the size of bubbles that are detected.
Hence, experimental measurements on artiﬁcial periodic
and quasiperiodic sequences might be very useful to give
some answers to these intriguing questions.

the results remained qualitatively the same. Of course,
this does not necessarily mean that there is not such a re-

Therefore, in the next section, we will study the theoret-

more direct comparison with experimental data than the

As explained in Sec. 3, the denaturation curves f (T ) and
p(T ) of Eq. (8) cannot be determined within the PBD
framework. Luckily, the l(T ) denaturation curve can be
calculated using the PBD model and can be measured
as well using a recently introduced experimental tech-
nique [23,25,24]. For several sequences, Montrichok et al. [23,25,24]
reported some anomalous behavior of l as function of T .
These experimental results are, hence, an excellent bench-
mark to test the validity of the PBD model. In this sec-
tion, we show the calculated l(T ) curves for the L60B36,

In Fig. 4, we show the calculated results for these sequence
using four values of ξ: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 ˚A. It is impor-
tant to note that the diﬀerent opening threshold values
considered do not change the qualitative behavior of the
curves. The curves with ξ = 2 ˚A intersect the lower thresh-
old value curves ξ = 1 ˚A and ξ = 1.5 ˚A. This might
seem impossible as each base k, that is counted as open
because yk > ξ = 2 ˚A, must also be open when a lower
opening threshold value is considered. However, we should
bear in mind that ξ not only determines the deﬁnition of
’open’ and ’closed’, but also determines the ensemble via
Eqs. (5,6). Considering Eq. (14), it is certainly true that
Zθk (R) is strictly decreasing as function of ξ. However,
Zπ(R) is strictly decreasing as well and, hence, the ratio
Zθk (R)] can actually increase

The experimental results for the L60B36 and L42B18
sequences contained a remarkable change of slope [23,25,24].
This eﬀect could indicate that the melting appears in two
steps in which ﬁrst an AT rich part of the sequence opens
up and is then followed by a GC rich region in the se-
quence. Our results do not show this signature. This is

in contrast with another computational study by Ares et
al.
[40] which does report some of the experimentally
found characteristics. However, the change of slope that
they found was negative for the both sequences L60B36
and L42B18, while the experimental results showed a very
sharp positive change of slope in the L42B18 sequence at
a temperature of 70 ‰. Still, the results of Ares et al.,
for the same sequences we studied, seem to resemble more
closely the experimental results than the ones by us. This
variance is explained by the following three reasons: (i)
Ares et al. used the alternative deﬁnition of ’open states’
as expressed by Eq. (10) instead of Eqs. [8,9]. (ii) They
applied a selective use of boundary conditions which were
periodic boundary conditions for the sequences L60B36,
L42B18, L33B9 and free boundaries, as in this work, for
the sequence L48AS. (iii) Ref. [40] allowed for complete
denaturation as it was based on a series of short MC sim-
ulations without the use of a bias-potential as in Eq. (7).
In fact, the work [40] even report on the f and p curves,
which cannot unambiguously be determined as we pointed
out in Sec. 3. Hence, the deviation from the experimental
results must imply that the present PBD model is insuﬃ-
cient to reproduce these non-trivial sequence speciﬁc order
eﬀects.

However, the experimental results themselves raise some

questions. If we were allowed to neglect the DNA-DNA in-
teraction, the l(T ) curve seems to provide a signature that
is theoretically independent to the concentration of DNA.
This is exactly why l(T ) can be determined within the
PBD framework. Still, it would be interesting to verify ex-
perimentally whether the l(T ) curve is indeed insensitive
to this concentration. Moreover, some of the experimental
results are a bit puzzling. The experimental f (T ) and p(T )
denaturation curves of the L33B9 sequence, for instance,

p)/(1

coincide at 75 ‰ while still f (75 ‰) = p(75 ‰) < 1 [24].
As l = (f
p), this would imply that l(T ) = 0 for
T > 75 ‰. This ﬁnding seems to be unphysical and this
is probably also the reason that Montrichok et al. have
depicted the l(T ) curve until T = 75 ‰ in Ref. [24]. This
indicates that one has to be careful when translating the
UV absorbance experiments in microscopic terms using
Eqs. (8,9). The theoretical development in this ﬁeld would
beneﬁt signiﬁcantly if more experimental data based on
the quenching technique were available.

8 Conclusions

The statistics of thermally induced DNA bubbles has be-
come an important subject of theoretical and experimen-
tal studies. Besides the fact that it is a interesting subject
from a purely statistical physics point of view, the rela-
tion between thermally induced bubbles and biologically
active sites has been subject of recent debate. Mesoscopic
models, like the PBD model, are a prerequisite in these
studies as the experimental data can usually only give
indirect information. However, even if a good theoretical
model is developed, it is not easy to obtain accurate re-
sults as large bubbles occur only seldom in a microscopic
system. In previous publications, the inaccuracy inherent
to MD have lead to premature conclusions such that the
TSS has a much stronger aﬃnity to form bubbles than
any other arbitrary site [1,2]. In a recent publication by
us [3], we showed, using a new statistical method that is
orders of magnitude faster than MD, that this statement
had to be reconsidered. Although the biologically active
sites have some enhanced opening due to their relative
high content of weak AT base-pairs, the bubble probabil-
ity proﬁle given by the PBD model was certainly not suf-
ﬁcient to make accurate predictions on transcription sites
or to discriminate between biologically active and inactive
sequences. Hence, this implies that either the biologically
active sites cannot be assigned by the information of ther-
mally induced bubbles alone or the actual PBD model
is insuﬃcient to describe all the sequence speciﬁc eﬀects
correctly. The S1 nuclease experiments seem to suggest
a correlation between bubbles in vitro and transcription
sites. It is, however, not exactly clear how the S1 nuclease
measurements should be translated in microscopic terms
that can be calculated by computer experiments.

In this article, we have revisited the direct numerical
integration technique that was introduced in [3]. We have
given a detailed explanation of the algorithm and inves-
tigated the performance of diﬀerent integration schemes.
Although the higher order Newton-Cotes schemes are bet-
ter for very high precision results with many digits, the
simple Simpson 1
3 -rule or Boole’s rule are more eﬃcient if
only an accuracy of a few percent is required. The opti-
mal result is obtained when the Simpson’s or Boole’s rule
is combined with the simple rectangular rule. The latter
is used when the function vanishes at the two integration
boundaries. Moreover, we have given a thorough discus-
sion on how to treat ﬁnite chains using the PBD model
by introducing the double stranded DNA ensemble. This

eliminates all the problems due to the unnormalizability of
equilibrium distribution in the full space and gives results
that can be compared by experiments performed below
the melting temperature.

Within this ensemble, we have deﬁned two types of
bubble probabilities. Pbub(k, m) is the probability that
a bubble of exactly size m is centered at base-pair k.
Ppart(k, m) is the participation probability that site k is in-
side a bubble of at least m bases long. Our analyses on the
AAVP5 promoter sequence and two artiﬁcial Fibonacci se-
quences conﬁrm what we found before [3]. No theoretical
evidence was found that bubbles appear more frequently
at transcription sites than at other sites that have a similar
AT content. When larger bubbles are considered, the eﬀect
of sequence speciﬁc order becomes even less important. A
recent theoretical study of Rapti et al. [45] conﬁrms this
and reveals that the PBD bubble statistics proﬁle can be
qualitatively reproduced by counting the number of AT
within a certain window that is larger than the bubble
size. The questions remains whether this is also true for
actual DNA. The S1 nuclease experiments suggest that
the behavior of real DNA is more complicated than that.

To study the validity of the PBD model, we applied our
method to calculate the so-called l-denaturation curves
that allow to make a more direct comparison to exper-
imental results. As argued, the standard f -denaturation
curve cannot be obtained without additional parameters
due the problem of normalizability for ﬁnite DNA chains.
Luckily, the l-denaturation curves can be measured as well
via a recently introduced quenching technique [23,24,25].
Our theoretical calculations did not reproduce the experi-
mentally found anomalies of the l(T ) denaturation curve.
This points out a signiﬁcant weakness of the present PBD
model. This also implies that the bubble hypothesis postu-
lated by Choi et al. [1] could still be supported by theoreti-
cal evidence whenever an ’ideal’ DNA model is considered.
The indirect evidence of the S1 nuclease experiments is yet
insuﬃcient to make this statement absolute as its meaning
in terms of microscopic terms is not yet completely un-
derstood. It is also diﬃcult to believe that the statement
holds for all TSS as some transcription sites are known
that consists of at least three consecutive strong base in
a row [47]. More systematic experimental and theoretical
studies are required.

Theoretical improvement can probably be achieved when

a more complicated stacking interaction is taken into ac-
count. We found that some of the anomalies found by
Montrichok et al. [23,24,25] could be reproduced using a
diﬀerent base-pair speciﬁc stacking potential W (yk, y−1)
(2) [48]. However, more complicated potentials might be
needed. It is important to note that the direct integration
method is not restricted to the PBD model only. It can
be used whenever the proper factorization (16) can be
applied. Our preliminary results indicate that the PBD
model could be improved considerably while still main-
taining the one-dimensional character of the model. This
implies that the direct integration method could still be
applied for this new class of models and will, hence, proba-

A Newton-Cotes integration schemes

In Sec.5, we have given the derivation of the direct inte-
gration method upto the numerical implementation which
basically comprises an iterative operation of Eq. (24). The
vector fj depends on choice of Newton-Cotes integration
scheme. In general, the Newton-Cotes numerical integra-
tion approximates any integral over an ﬁnite range
n
a)/∆y. From the
i=0 fi g(a + i∆y) with n = (b
by ∆y
various Newton-Cotes schemes, we will discuss the simple
rectangular rule, Simpson 1
3 -rule, Boole’s rule, and the 11-
point Newton-Cotes formula. The corresponding fi vec-
tors are listed below.

The right choice of integration scheme can signiﬁcantly
improve the precision of the method. One cannot say in
advance that the highest order scheme is always prefer-
able. This can depend on the shape of the function g, the
applied integration boundaries, and the required precision.
In order to study the accuracy of the integration methods,
we applied the diﬀerent schemes (25-29) on the standard

ber of integration intervals n must be multiples of a certain
value. These are 2, 4, and 10 for, respectively, Simpson’s
rule, Boole’s rule and 11-point Newton-Cotes. However,
as the function vanishes at the right boundary (x = 10
in our numerical approach) we can take the semi-inﬁnite
analogue where we start with f0 at the point x = a (or

result from the cut-oﬀ at ±10.

In ﬁg. 5, we have plotted the integration errors as func-
tion of n obtained by the ﬁve Newton-Cotes methods and
the three values of a. We see that the highest order scheme
is not always the best choice. In fact, for the integration
over the full range (a =
), the simple rectangular rule
is identical to the trapezoidal rule, but far superior to the
other methods (27-29). Naturally, as the function vanishes
at both ends, the result would not change much upon shift-

shifts using Eqs. (27-29) results in a weighted summation
that approaches the simple rectangular rule (25). The op-
timum performance of the rectangular rule on the inﬁnite
domain is, hence, not surprising.

The trapezoidal rule gives the optimal result for the
case a = 0. Also this is not too surprising as the function
is symmetric and the trapezoidal rule is exactly half the
result of the rectangular rule over the full domain. For
a = 1 we ﬁnd, as expected, that the 11-point Newton-
Cotes method gives the best result. However, only at large
n the diﬀerence becomes apparent.

Cotes schemes for the bubble statistics in the PBD model.
As a benchmark, we compared the calculated values of
l (9) at temperature T = 300 K and threshold opening
ξ = 1 ˚A for a 10 base-pair long homogeneous AT chain
with free boundaries. Considering previous results, we al-
ways applied the rectangular rule for the integrals in (16)
when the integrated function vanishes at both integra-
tion or cut-oﬀ boundaries in yk−1. These are either at
d. When the integrated func-
yk−1 = L or at yk−1 = yk ±
tion only vanishes at one end, we applied the semi-inﬁnite
variation of one of the Newton-Cotes formulas [25-29].
It is important to notice that, as we mentioned before,
the distribution function is not vanishing at yk−1 = R.
Hence, the Newton-Cotes rule needs to be applied at this
boundary for an optimal accuracy; i. e. we start with f0
at this boundary and continue in the negative direction

at the right boundary yN = R, the function is not neces-
sarily decayed below ǫ. This also implies that R
ξ is the
only interval that must be a special multiple of ∆y. This
must be an multiple of 2 for Simpson’s rule, 4 for Boole’s
rule and 10 for 11-point Newton-Cotes rule and this gives
the restriction to the possible integer values that IR can
take.

After these technical details are taken into account,
the Newton-Cotes formulas [25-29] can be applied to the
benchmark system and allow to compare the diﬀerent in-
tegration methods. The results are depicted in table 1.
These show that it is certainly beneﬁcial to go beyond the
simple rectangular or trapezoidal rule. Although, higher
order schemes like the 11-point Newton-Cotes are presum-
ably better at very small values of ∆y and very high pre-
cision, at larger values of ∆y the Simpson’s and Boole’s
method give better results. The highest precision results
with ∆y = 0.0125 ˚A show an accuracy of 8 digests for
both Simpson, Boole and 11-point Newton-Cotes, while
the computational expense is less than a minute. Such a
performance is far beyond any MD or MC method even if
enhanced sampling is applied [51].

For our purposes, an accuracy a few percent is enough.
Therefore, considering the results of Fig. 5 and Table 1,
we have chosen to use Simpson’s rule with a grid spacing

of ∆y = 0.1. In the results of Sec. 6 and 7, we have always
used these parameters.

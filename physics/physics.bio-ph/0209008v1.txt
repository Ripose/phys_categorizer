Abstrat

The presynapti free alium dynamis of neurons due to various stimulation protools

is investigated in a mathematial model. Espeially, onnetions between free alium dy-

namis and the indution of synapti long-term e(cid:27)ets are onsidered. The model inludes

alium in(cid:29)ux through voltage-direted alium hannels, alium bu(cid:27)ering by endogenous

and exogenous bu(cid:27)ers as well as alium e(cid:31)ux through ATP-driven plasma membrane alium

pumps and sodium/alium exhangers. A lassi(cid:28)ation of parameters into universal (widely

independent of neuron types) and spei(cid:28) ones (depending on neuron type and experimental

setup) allows the appliations of the model to di(cid:27)erent lasses of neurons and experiments.

This is demonstrated for single boutons of pyramidal neurons of the rat neoortex. The model

parameters are determined using orresponding (cid:29)uoresene measurements (Koester and Sak-

mann, 2000). The model enables us to reonstrut the free alium dynamis in neurons as

it would have been without (cid:29)uoresene indiators starting from the (cid:29)uoresene data. We

(cid:28)nd that during high-frequeny stimulation a new baseline in the free alium onentration

ours. The emergene of suh an enhaned baseline may be important for the indution of

long-term potentiation.

1 Introdution

Calium is an important ellular messenger. In partiular, alium plays a key role in synapti

transmission. For example, it triggers the seretion of neurotransmitter (Llinas et al., 1981; Katz,

1969) and is involved in synapti plastiity (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993). Synapti plastiity is

the apability of speial kinds of neurons to hange their e(cid:30)ieny of synapti transmission on long

time sales aused by the appliation of a presynapti tetanus. Plastiity is most likely related to

the neural bases of memory (Tsien, 2000). Two important phenomena of these long-term e(cid:27)ets

(LTE) are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), and it has been shown

that the indution of LTE is onneted to a prior alium in(cid:29)ux into the neuron (Baudry and

Davis, 1996). But it is under ative investigation whih biohemial proesses atually ativate

the indution of LTE. The presynapti and postsynapti ontribution have also been intensively

disussed (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993; Shimuta et al., 2001; Castillo et al., 2002). This diversity

is aused by the omplexity of alium dynamis (due to the variety of di(cid:27)erent alium soures

and sinks in the neuron) and the extensive partiipation of alium in many biohemial proesses

in the neuron as well as important di(cid:27)erenes between neuron types.

It is important to understand the involvement of alium dynamis in synapti plastiity in

more details. To ahieve at a deeper understanding we shall ask if and how spei(cid:28) signals that

indue LTE are represented in alium dynamis and whih alium soures and sinks are essential?

One may apply LTE stimulation protools with varying frequenies and then ompare the resulting

presynapti alium answers. The spei(cid:28) strutural hanges of the alium response may be of

relevane for the indution of the LTE.

Experiments are exeuted using a great variety of di(cid:27)erent neurons and di(cid:27)erent experimental

onditions. Therefore, a omparative approah beomes di(cid:30)ult even being attrative. We present

a new theoretial model whih is based on single protein properties and whih may be used to

ompare the results of di(cid:27)erent experiments quantitatively. To this end we lassify the model

parameters into universal and spei(cid:28) ones. Universal parameters are postulated to have neuron-

type independent properties whih applies to parameters desribing single membrane proteins.

Spei(cid:28) parameters depend on the neuron under onsideration or on the details of the experimental

protool. This onerns the surfae density of membrane proteins as well as for example type and

onentration of the alium indiator. The advantage of suh a lassi(cid:28)ation is that the universal

parameters have to be determined one and are then preserved for all simulations. Consequently,

only the spei(cid:28) parameters have to be adjusted to the experimental setup under onsideration.

2

This opens the possibility to desribe di(cid:27)erent experiments on the basis of one model. The model

presented here desribes the presynapti side of the synapse and will be tuned for one experiment

analysing the alium transients in pyramidal neurons of the rat neoortex in response to di(cid:27)erent

stimulation protools (Koester and Sakmann, 2000).

For our new model we will partially make use of the knowledge established in previous models

for the free alium dynamis whih primarily exist for postsynapti neurons (Gamble and Koh,

1987) and for dendriti trees (Volfovsky et al., 1999; DeShutter and Smolen, 1998). Some models

also investigate presynapti alium dynamis in response to single ation potentials (Sinha et al.,

1997; Helmhen et al., 1997; Sabatini and Regehr, 1998). As the presynapti volume we investigate

is small enough in order to assume a homogeneous intraellular alium onentration we neither

have to use more-ompartment models (Holmes and Levy, 1990) nor have to onsider partial

di(cid:27)erential equations as has been done to desribe the di(cid:27)usion of intraellular alium (Cooper

et al., 1996). Therefore, we restrit ourselves to a set of oupled ordinary di(cid:27)erential equations.

However, as we laim to generate a model whih is quantitatively appliable to di(cid:27)erent neurons

and experiments one should be aware of the limitation to presynapti boutons smaller than about

2 µm.

Our main interest is a quantitative desription of presynapti free alium dynamis in response

to LTE induing stimulation protools. We want to look for harateristis in alium time ourses

whih are spei(cid:28) for diverse stimulations during this very early stage of LTE indution. However,

the relation of alium dynamis and LTE has mainly been investigated for postsynapti neurons

(Gamble and Koh, 1987; Holmes and Levy, 1990; Zador et al., 1990; Siegel et al., 1994; Shiegg et

al., 1995). We will analyze presynapti alium dynamis in response to LTE stimulation protools

in the framework of the new model and we hope that our ansatz opens the possibility to ompare

alium transients from the perspetive of LTE for di(cid:27)erent experimental systems and setups.

2 Methods

The intraellular free alium dynamis due to a prede(cid:28)ned, time dependent membrane potential

of a presynapti neural domain is desribed by using a set of ordinary di(cid:27)erential equations. This

neural domain is repesented by a ell membrane whih separates the extraellular spae from the

intraellular spae. Spei(cid:28) membrane proteins are embedded into this membrane. Some of these

membrane proteins and in addition some intraellular proteins determine the dynamis of the free

alium ions onentration (Llinas, 1982; Carafoli, 2002; Magee et al., 1998).

3

The model geometry onsists of a homogenous reation volume (one-ompartment) whih is

situated in a homogeneous extraellular spae. We are using a spherial symmetry of the reation

volume. However, the results remain valid for other shapes provided that the surfae to volume

ratio is onserved. In general presynapti boutons are relatively small, i.e. having a diameter

of the order of mirons (Koester and Sakmann, 2000). We assume that the proess of di(cid:27)usion

of alium ions is fast enough to reah an equilibrium distribution on a time sale of one ms.

This assumption has to be reviewed onsidering larger reation volumes as found in postsynapses.

Consequently, also the surfae densities of membrane proteins have to be interpreted as average

values over the whole reation surfae.

Starting from a ell in equilibrium the appliation of a depolarizing membrane potential U

indues a free alium ion urrent between the reation volume and the extraellular spae through

diverse membrane proteins. This leads to a hange of the intraellular free alium onentration

Every soure and every sink of the free alium ions is represented by its own term. Ji is the in(cid:29)ux

urrent density per membrane surfae unit through voltage-direted alium hannels (VDCC)

(Tsien, 1983; Bean, 1989; Hess, 1990). It diretly depends on the applied membrane potential U

(the time dependene in Eq. (2) is noted expliitly to emphasize that U (t) is treated as input

signal), and the e(cid:27)etive reversal potential U and is desribed in detail in setion 2.1. Je is

the e(cid:31)ux urrent density per membrane surfae unit aused by ATP-driven plasma membrane

alium pumps (PMCA) (Monteith and Roufogalis, 1995; Penniston and Enyedi, 1998; Carafoli,

1992) and sodium/alium exhangers (NCX) (Blaustein and Lederer, 1999; Strehler, 1990; DiPolo

and Beauge, 1999). It depends on the free intraellular alium onentration c and is desribed

in detail in setion 2.3. The leakage surfae urrent density L represents the residual ondutivity

of the membrane and is determined by the steady state onditions (setion 2.6). The terms Ben

and Bex stand for the ation of endogenous and the exogenous bu(cid:27)ers (Miller, 1995; Klee, 1988;

Pottorf et al., 2000), respetively, whih bind to and disengage from the free alium ions (see

4

setion 2.2). The geometry fator

G = O/V

(3)

is the surfae to volume ratio.

It translates the urrent densities (Ji , Je , L ) into hanges of

free intraellular alium onentration. z and F are the valene harge of alium ions and the

Faraday onstant, respetively.

Note, that the separation of universal and spei(cid:28) parameters is not re(cid:29)eted in Eq. (2) whih

is an e(cid:27)etive desription of the alium dynamis. However, in the following setions the explit

form of the urrents entering the equation will be developed on the level of single membrane

proteins. It is at this point that the parameter lassi(cid:28)ation will be mirrored in the mathematial

presription.

2.1 Calium in(cid:29)ux through VDCC

The VDCC is haraterized by a urrent-voltage relation based on both a voltage dependent

urrent through the open pore I single channel

open

as well as a voltage dependent opening probability gv

(Tsien, 1983). We propose the following e(cid:27)etive desription of the alium in(cid:29)ux urrent density

Ji through VDCC

Ji

U (t) , U (c)
(cid:0)

= ρv gv (U (t)) gv (cid:0)

U (c) − U (t)
(cid:1)

.

|

{z
I single channel
open

}

Ji is weighted with the surfae density of the hannels ρv being the most important ell-type spei(cid:28)

parameter. Pratially all other parameters de(cid:28)ning the single hannel properties belong to the

lass of universal parameters. The alium urrent through the open pore I single channel

open

is driven by

the eletrohemial gradient over the membrane (Nernst, 1889; Plank, 1890). A urrent aused by

hanges of the membrane potential is followed by hanges of the intraellular alium onentration

and these retroat on the urrent. The alium urrent due to the membrane potential gradient

is approximated by a linear voltage-urrent relation with open pore ondutivity gv . This is

justi(cid:28)ed for physiologially relevant membrane potentials for whih the VDCC urrent-voltage

relation has been found to be indeed nearly linear (Magee and Johnston, 1995; Fisher et al., 1990;

Gri(cid:30)th et al., 1994). The important potential di(cid:27)erene entering Eq. (4) is the one relative to the

alium reversal potential U whih dynamially inorporates the alium onentration gradient

R is the molar gas onstant and T is the absolute temperature. cext stands for the external alium

onentration. ∆Ueﬀ orrets the exat reversal potential for the linear approximation. As it has

been found that e(cid:31)ux alium urrents through VDCC at voltages above the reversal potential

are negligible (Hille, 1992; Brown et al., 1981) we set I single channel

= 0 for U > U . The single

open

hannel open probability gv is governed by the speial dynamis

whih may be related to experiment using data for the average number of open hannels in an

ensemble of hannels (Gri(cid:30)th et al., 1994; O'Dell and Alger, 1991; Magee and Johnston, 1995).

of the asymptoti opening probability

2.2 Calium bu(cid:27)ering via endogenous and exogenous bu(cid:27)ers

The main part of the intraellular alium is bound to an endogenous bu(cid:27)er (Belan et al., 1993a;

Belan et al., 1993b). In addition, also a (cid:29)ouresene indiator used in experiments ats as an

exogenous bu(cid:27)er (Helmhen et al., 1996).

In the rest state of the neuron the amount of free

bu(cid:27)ers is still large enough suh that during stimulation the dominant part of inoming free

alium ions bind to these bu(cid:27)ers (Neher and Augustine, 1992). The steadily ongoing binding and

dissoiation proess of alium and bu(cid:27)ers strongly in(cid:29)uene the resulting free alium dynamis.

This applies not only to the phase of growing alium onentration during stimulation but also

to the return of the alium onentration to the base level. Therefore, we inlude both types of

6

bu(cid:27)ers expliitly in the model using the following kineti equations

d
dt

ben,ex = −k

−
en,ex ben,ex + k+

en,ex c

b0
en,ex − ben,ex
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

for the endogenous and exogenous bu(cid:27)er, respetively (Wagner and Keizer, 1994; Shiegg et al.,

1995; Sabatini and Regehr, 1998). Here, ben and bex are the onentrations of bound bu(cid:27)ers, b0
en

and n0

ex are the total onentrations of the intraellular bu(cid:27)er proteins. k+

en,ex and k−

en,ex are the

rate onstants in units of

1

µM ms and

1
ms , respetively. Note, that the soure and the sink terms

for the bu(cid:27)ers (Eq. (8)) are the sink and the soure terms, respetively, for the alium dynamis

(Eq. (2))

Ben,ex (c) = −

ben,ex .

d
dt

The rate onstants are in general not available from experiment. We use the realisti assumption

that the bu(cid:27)er dynamis takes plaes on short time sales ompared to the alium dynamis, i.e.

that the bu(cid:27)er dynamis is always in a quasi steady state. The quasi steady state approxima-

tion has two important onsequenes. First, on the short time sale the bound endogenous and

exogenous bu(cid:27)er onentrations ben,ex beome onstant and an be written as

ben,ex (c) =

c b0

en,ex

Ken,ex + c

.

This implies that the bound bu(cid:27)er onentration is adapted instantaneouly to the free alium

onentration at eah time point t. Therefore, we have

Bqss

en,ex (c) = −

ben,ex (c) = −

ben,ex (c)

c .

d
dc

d
dt

d

With the help of Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) the alium dynamis (Eq. (2)) gets a more substantially

ompat form:

d
dt

G

c =

1 + Ten + Tex

.

Ten and Tex are dimensionless variables:

(8)

(13)

Ten (c) =

and

is a orretion fator in Eq. (12) whih depends only on the free alium onen-

1
1+Ten+Tex

tration. The great advantage of this approximation (Wagner and Keizer, 1994) is that Eq. (12)

only involves the dissoiation onstants Ken,ex of the bu(cid:27)ers instead of both rate onstants k+
and k−

en,ex . In general the dissoiation onstants are available from experiment.

2.3 Calium e(cid:31)ux through PMCA and NCX

The PMCA and the NCX are proteins whih atively transport alium ions through the membrane

(Carafoli, 1991; Blaustein and Lederer, 1999) and therefore have to be desribed di(cid:27)erently from

pores. The PMCA pumps alium ions against an eletrohemial gradient using the energy of

ATP moleules. The NCX transports alium ions out of the neuron by exhanging them with

sodium ions. The alium dependene of the PMCA-kinetis observed in experiments is well

desribed by the Hill equation (Elwess et al., 1997; Verma et al., 1996; Desrosiers et al., 1996).

The ativity of the PMCA and the NCX is limited to a maximum rate (Caride et al., 2001;

Blaustein and Lederer, 1999; Strehler, 1990) whih follows from the moleulare struture of the

proteins. Correspondingly, the free alium e(cid:31)ux in Eq. (2) gets the form

Je (c) = ρp gp (c) I p + ρx gx (c) I x .

(15)

This is again formulated on the single protein level, where ρp,x represent the spei(cid:28) surfae

densities of the membrane proteins and I p,x the universal maximum ativity rates of the PMCA

and the NCX, respetively. For the universal ativity harateristis gp,x we assume Hill equations

gp (c) =

(c)np
(c)np + (Hp)np

and gx (c) =

(c)nx
(c)nx + (Hx)nx

(16)

whih diretly depend on the free alium onentration c. Hp,x are the half ativation onentra-

tions and np,x the Hill oe(cid:30)ents. This is justi(cid:28)ed in the ase of PMCA (Elwess et al., 1997) while

no expliit measurements exist in the ase of NCX. Nevertheless, it is a reasonable assumption

that the prinipal behavior is also well desribed by a Hill equation.

2.4 Universal properties of the model

The lassi(cid:28)ation of the model parameters represents an important element of our model beause it

enables us to separate those properties whih are basially independent of the ell-type from those

whih are sensitive for di(cid:27)erenes between ell-types, ompartments, and experimental setups.

8

The universal properties of the proteins are postulated to remain invariant for all kinds of neurons

and we extrated these values from various single-protein experimental results. The values of

universal parameters for VDCC, PMCA and NCX as used in the model are summarized in Tab. 1.

VDCC. These hannel-proteins are multisubunit omplexes whih form a voltage sensitive

transmembrane pore. Six types of VDCC are known, orresponding to the pharmaologial prop-

erties (i.e. L-, N-, P/Q-, R-type as high-voltage-ativated (HVA) hannels and T-type as low-

voltage-ativated (LVA) hannels. These types are primarily haraterized by genes enoding a

di(cid:27)erent subunit (e.g. the α1 subunit) but an overall mathing perentage of nearly 50% (for HVA

hannels only) (Lainova et al., 2000). The alium in(cid:29)ux into the presynapti terminal is domi-

nated by the P/Q- and N-type hannels (Koester and Sakmann, 2000). Eah type of VDCC should

have the same biophysial properties in all kinds of tissues and animals. Unfortunately the atual

preision of the experiments, espeially taking into aount the variety of experimental setups, does

not allow to quantitatively identify the biophysial properties orresponding to eah hannel type

(Lorenzon and Foehring, 1995; Tottene et al., 1996; Magee and Johnston, 1995). The resulting un-

ertainties dominate the di(cid:27)erenes between the hannel types. Therefore, we hose the values from

one single hannel measurement of N-type hannels onsidering it as a representative member for

the VDCC. However, if more onlusive values for di(cid:27)erent VDCC-types are found in future we may

disentangle the in(cid:29)uene of di(cid:27)erent sub-types on alium transients. Conerning the measure-

ments of the P/Q- and N-type hannels two additional problems exist. Most measurements were

performed with Ba2+

as arrier ion and the obtained ondutivity di(cid:27)ers from the alium ondu-

tivity (Lorenzon and Foehring, 1995). Aditionally all measurements were made at room temper-

ature (20 − 25◦C) and the biophysial properties are temperature dependent (Coulter et al., 1989;

Takahashi et al., 1991). Thus, the obtained alium in(cid:29)ux through the VDCC di(cid:27)ers between

measurements made at room temperature from those whih were made at blood temperature. We

neglet both deviations beause we ould neither (cid:28)nd onvining extrapolations of the tempera-

ture behaviour nor a su(cid:30)ient relation of di(cid:27)erent harge arrier ions. Anyhow, those deviations

stay within the urrent experimental auray.

PMCA. There exist four di(cid:27)erent genes whih enode the PMCA (PMCA1-4) and additionally

they all our in di(cid:27)erent spliing variants (labeled by small letters). All these isoforms have

di(cid:27)erent kineti properties but again we assume that one isoform should have the same properties

in eah type of tissues and animal. The dominant isoforms of PMCA in the rat brain are the

1a-, 2a-, 2b-, 3a-, 3b-, and 4b-type (Penniston and Enyedi, 1998; Filoteo et al., 1997; Lehotsky,

9

1995). Similarly to the VDCC the measured kineti properties vary onsiderably due to the

di(cid:27)erent experimental onditions for one type of PMCA (Enyedi et al., 1991; Elwess et al., 1997;

Filoteo et al., 2000) and we hose as representative member the PMCA2a protein. The Hill

oe(cid:30)ent and the onentration of half ativation are taken from a measurement for rat PMCA

(Elwess et al., 1997) and the maximum pump urrent is alulated from (Elwess et al., 1997;

Enyedi et al., 1993). We neglet other regulation mehanisms of the PMCA-ativity e.g. the roles

of almodulin or of ATP (whih is onsidered to be available to a su(cid:30)ient degree).

NCX. In the ase of the NCX three di(cid:27)erent genes (NCX1-3) with di(cid:27)erent spliing variants

are known. Here, we do not speify the type of NCX. We hose average values for the maximum

urrent (Juhaszova et al., 2000) and for the onentration of half ativation (Blaustein and Lederer,

1999), and set the Hill oe(cid:30)ent of the NCX to one. It is worth emphasizing that our results are not

signi(cid:28)antly altered for other Hill oe(cid:30)ent. Other regulation mehanisms (e.g. the dependene

on sodium) are not onsidered in the model.

2.5 Spei(cid:28) properties of the model

Per de(cid:28)nition the spei(cid:28) parameters have to be adjusted to the spei(cid:28) neuron type and om-

partment geometry in the experiment under onsideration. Espeially, this onerns the rest state

properties (i.e. geometry fator G, rest state membrane potential U0 , rest state intraellular c0

and extraellular cext alium onentration) whih in general are indiated in the experiments.

This applies not neessarily to the dissoiation onstant Km and the total onentration m0 of

the endogenous bu(cid:27)er. Here we hose Calmodulin as representative member of bu(cid:27)er moleules

and we assume that the four bu(cid:27)er binding sites are independent. Our aim is to quantitatively

ompare the results of our model with experiments. Beause all visualisations of alium dynam-

is in neural ompartments are performed with (cid:29)uoresene indiators we have to inlude the

parameters spei(cid:28) for the used type of indiator. The orresponding dissoiation onstant an

be extrated from orresponding data sheets and the indiator onentration is usually indiated

in the experimental protool.

The most ritial spei(cid:28) parameters are the membrane protein surfae densities (e.g. VDCC

ρv , PMCA ρp ). They are rarely known for spei(cid:28) ell types. Even more seldomly they are

indiated in spei(cid:28) experiments. In addition measurements of protein densities are usually valid

for very spei(cid:28) areas on the ell membrane. It is di(cid:30)ult to extrapolate those densities to an

average density on a whole presynapse as it is used in the model. As our main interest points

10

towards the analysis of alium transients in response to LTE induing stimulation protools we

proeed as follows. We use single ation potential alium transients measured as (cid:29)uoresene

signal to (cid:28)t the unknown protein densities. Then the values found are retained and used for the

analysis of alium transients after other stimulation protools. This proedure is explained in

more details in setion 3.1.

2.6 Equilibrium, stability and stimulation

To obtain a realisti simulation of alium dynamis the model has to reover a stable equilibrium

state after some stimulation. That is ahieved by the requirement that in the rest state of the

neuron (de(cid:28)ned by the rest membrane potential U0 and the free rest alium onentratrion c0 )

the lek ondutivity of the membrane L exatly ompensates the netto urrent densities oming

from VDCC (Ji ), PMCA and NCX (Je ).

After appliation of any type of stimulation the free alium onentration indeed returns to the

rest onentration. We did not (cid:28)nd any instabilities of the alium dynamis within physiologially

relevant stimulation protools. The model results are robust against variation of any parameters

on the qualitative level. Quantitatively the results are most sensitive to variations of the membrane

protein surfae densities and of the dissoiation onstant of the endogenous bu(cid:27)er.

For the stimulation protools (single ation potential and trains of ation potentials) we use

membrane potentials U (t) whih are simulated with a system of oupled di(cid:27)erential equations (not

shown here). The parameters of those equations have to be adjusted suh that the stimulation

shapes as found in the experiment under onsideration are appropriately reprodued.

3 Results

We investigate the presynapti alium dynamis due to typial LTE stimulation protools in order

to look for relations between presynapti alium and LTE e(cid:27)ets. To hek if our model orretly

desribes the presynapti alium dynamis in response to single ation potentials, we tuned the

model with respet to an experiment measuring the alium dynamis in presynapti boutons of

pyramidal neurons in the neoortex of rats (Koester and Sakmann, 2000). The orresponding

alium transients an be reprodued for reasonable membrane protein surfae densities. Using

those parameters we an alulate the alium dynamis due to a 10 Hz tetanus and ompare

the result to orresponding measurements (Koester and Sakmann, 2000) (see setion 3.1). A

11

qualitative disussion of alium transients in response to various stimulation protools is provided

in setion 3.2. Finally we will quantitatively illustrate the in(cid:29)uene of (cid:29)uoresene indiators on

alium dynamis and disuss the impliations for experiments using (cid:29)uoresene indiators to

measure alium transients in response to typial LTE stimulations (see setion 3.3).

3.1 Quantitative model test

At (cid:28)rst we verify that our model an desribe alium transients evoked by single ation potentials

in single presynapti boutons from pyramidal neurons in the neoortex of rats. There exists

a very detailed orresponding (cid:29)uoresene measurements (Koester and Sakmann, 2000). The

universal parameteres should espeially apply for this system and are used as shown in Tab. 1.

The spei(cid:28) parameters are determined diretly and indiretly by the measurement (Koester and

Sakmann, 2000) and by using independent experimental results. We alulated the geometry

fator with the help of a (cid:29)uoresene (cid:28)gure of the whole bouton (Fig. 3A in Koester and Sakmann,

2000). We determined the dissoiation onstant of the endogenous bu(cid:27)er Km using the observation

that approximately only 1% of the total inoming intraellular alium remains free (Koester

and Sakmann, 2000). The surfae density of the NCX ρx was determined with the help of a

measurement whih investigates its ratio to the PMCA density ρp (Juhaszova et al., 2000). The

values for the spei(cid:28) parameters are summarized in Tab. 2. They have to be arefully interpreted

as an approximation for the neuron type under onsideration.

In general alium measurements in neurons use (cid:29)uoresene indiators to visualize the alium

onentration and distribution. As already pointed out suh (cid:29)uoresene indiators at as an

exogenous bu(cid:27)er system whih, therefore, has been inluded into the model presription (see

setion 2.2). With the help of a 1 : 1 omplexation ansatz (Koester and Sakmann, 2000; Ja(cid:27)e et

al., 1994; Grynkiewiz et al., 1985) we translated the simulation of the alium dynamis into a

simulation of the (cid:29)uoresene signal

∆f /f = (∆f /f )max

c (t) − c0
c (t) + Kex

.

(17)

∆f /f is the relative (cid:29)uoresene hange , (∆f /f )max represents its maximum, and Kex is the

dissoiation onstant of the indiator. The properties of the used indiators (Magnesium Green

(Moleular Probes)) are shown in Tab. 2. Note, that in the experiment di(cid:27)erent onentrations of

indiator have been used (Koester and Sakmann, 2000).

12

The only remaining free parameters are the surfae densities of the VDCC ρv and the PMCA

ρp . We simulate the amplitude and the shape of the ation potential as applied to the presynapse

in the experiment and (cid:28)t the protein densities (see Tab. 2) suh that the simulation result agrees

with the measured (cid:29)uoresene signal evoked by a single ation potential (Fig. 15C in Koester and

Sakmann, 2000). Note that the experiment has been exeuted with 100 µM Magnesium Green

(Moleular Probes) and (∆f /f )100 µM

max

has to be hosen orrespondingly (see Tab. 2). The result

is shown in Fig. 1. The amplitude and the shape of the simulated (cid:29)uoresene answer are in good

agreement with the data observed in experiment.

The next step is to investigate wether the same model without hanging the model assumptions

is able to desribe alium transients evoked by more omplex stimulation protools. We ompare

the (cid:29)uoresene response evoked by a 10 Hz tetanus to the model preditions. To this end the

ation potentials in the model have to be adjusted to those used in experiment (Fig. 9; upper panel

in Koester and Sakmann, 2000). The experiment has been performed with 500 µM Magnesium

Green (Moleular Probes) and we orreted the indiator onentration orrespondingly. The

maximal relative (cid:29)uoresene hange (∆f /f )500 µM

max

has not been stated expliitly. Therefore, we

determine this value by the requirement that the alium signal in response to a single ation

potential (Fig. 15C; middle olumn in Koester and Sakmann, 2000) is reprodued orretly (data

not shown). Finally, the protein surfae densities are adjusted to reprodue the alium answer to

the (cid:28)rst ation potential of the tetanus (see Tab. 2). The subsequent alium signal as predited

by the model turns out to be in perfet agreement with the (cid:29)uoresene signal (see Fig. 2). Note,

that all others parameters of the model remained unhanged. We onlude that the model one

(cid:28)tted to the alium signal in response to single ation potentials in a spei(cid:28) type of neuron

desribes the alium signal due to tetanus stimulation without further hanges.

3.2 LTE stimulation protools

In the following we ompare the alium transients in response to three LTE stimulation protools

with di(cid:27)erent frequenies for the above mentioned system. The main question we address is

whether there are harateristi di(cid:27)erenes between these alium transients or not. In the low

frequeny domain (2 Hz, 3.5 s) the alium response appears as a train of independent single ation

potential responses (Fig. 3). The alium onentration follows the ativation by eah ation

potential. Shape and amplitude of eah alium response is unaltered ompared to the response

to a single ation potential. This frequenies range is typially used for LTD indution (Connor

13

et al., 1999). The alium signal as provided by the model does not ontain any harateristi

signature whih may be related to the indution of LTD.

For higher frequenies (20 Hz, 350 ms) the stimulation protool gets into the transition domain

between indution of LTD and LTP. A new baseline in the alium onentration arises during

stimulation (Fig. 4). The alium pumps and the natrium/alium exhangers have not enough

time to return the neuron into its rest state. This implies an overlap of alium answers to sub-

sequent ation potentials. Note, that this qualitative behaviour has been observed in experiments

performed on dendriti spines of pyramidal neurons (Helmhen et al., 1996). However, we an not

expet that the presynapti model also quantitatively desribes the alium response in dendriti

spines orretly.

The emergene of a new baseline for stimulations with higher frequenies is a signi(cid:28)ant di(cid:27)er-

ene ompared to the alium answer to LTD tetani. One may suspet that this new baseline is an

important part of the LTP indution proess. The intraellular alium onentration is durably

enhaned ompared to the short peak after single ation potentials. Indeed, the intensity of stim-

ulation protools have to overome some threshold to indue LTP (Connor et al., 1999). The new

alium baseline emerges for frequenies that are in the same range as this threshold (Rik and

Milgram, 1996). This hypothesis also agrees with the experimental fat that a modest alium

in(cid:29)ux auses LTD, whereas a high magnitude alium in(cid:29)ux triggers LTP (Yang et al., 1999;

Yasuda and Tsumoto, 1996).

During the appliation of a typial LTP tetanus (50 Hz, 1 s) the indued alium spikes remain

in phase with the stimulating membrane potential. The enhanement of the alium baseline

beomes even more pronouned (Fig. 5). Again the new baseline saturates during stimulation but

on a higher level ompared to the 20 Hz stimulation. The exat shape of the alium signal is

a result of an interplay of membrane proteins and alium bu(cid:27)ers. However, we observed some

relations between the general appearane of the alium signal and some spei(cid:28) neuron properties.

The surfae density of VDCC basially determines the amplitude of the alium spike on the top

of the baseline. The dissoiation onstant determines whih part of the inoming alium binds

to the bu(cid:27)er. The time sale on whih the alium onentration returns to its rest state is

governed by the surfae densities of the PMCA, NCX and the dissoiation onstant of the bu(cid:27)er.

We emphasize that even higher stimulation frequenies lead to still higher baseline levels of the

alium onentration. The reahed baseline grows quadratially with the stimulation frequeny

up to 100 Hz.

14

3.3 Flouresene indiators and LTP experiments

In setion 3.2 we have seen that for stimulations with frequenies above some threshold frequeny

a new baseline of the alium onentration arises.

In the following we show that the use of

(cid:29)uoresene indiators for the visualization of alium in experiments alters the alium answer

and espeially the emergene of a new baseline onsiderably.

In Fig. 6 the alium transients

evoked by single ation potentials with and without (cid:29)uoresene indiator is ompared (100 µM

Magnesium Green (Moleular Probes)). The amplitude of the alium signal is dereased if the

(cid:29)uoresene indiator is used.

In addition the alium relaxation time (needed to reover the

rest alium onentration) beomes onsiderably larger using the (cid:29)uoresene indiator. These

relations are not surprising as the indiator binds an important part of inoming free alium ions

and redues the free alium onentration. Note, that it is not a dereased pump ativity whih

auses larger relaxation times. There are onsequenes for the interpretation of experiments using

(cid:29)uoresene indiators. In Fig. 7 the in(cid:29)uene of the (cid:29)uoresene indiator (500 µM Magnesium

Green (Moleular Probes)) on the alium transients evoked by a 10 Hz tetanus in a pyramidal

neuron of the rat neoortex (Koester and Sakmann, 2000) is shown. The left panel (with (cid:29)uores-

ene indiator) learly exhibits a new baseline of the alium onentration whereas the baseline

remains pratially unhanged in the right panel (without (cid:29)uoresene indiator). Beause of the

longer relaxation time for the alium spikes the (cid:29)uoresene indiator fasilitates the emergene

of a new baseline. Using a (cid:29)uoresene indiator the alium spikes overlap already for lower fre-

quenies. Consequently, the threshold stimulation frequeny for the emergene of a new baseline

is higher for neurons without indiator ompared to neurons that has been treated with indiator.

Note, that the right panel in Fig. 7 provides a quantitative predition of the alium signal in the

pyramidal neuron of the neoortex as it would have been without the use of alium indiator

starting from the alium measurement (Koester and Sakmann, 2000). The same reonstrution

proedure may be applied to other experiments in future.

4 Disussion

We developed a new model for the presynapti alium dynamis whih inludes VDCC, PMCA,

and NCX, as well as endogenous bu(cid:27)ers and (cid:29)uoresene indiators. Those ingredients turned out

to be su(cid:30)ient to reprodue a (cid:29)uoresene measurement of intraellular free alium transients in

response to single ation potentials in pyramidal neurons of the rat neoortex in a quantitatively

15

orret way. On the basis of the parameter set determined by the single ation potential alium

transients the model predits the alium response to 10 Hz tetani (using the same neuron type)

in a quantitatively aurate way. We onlude that from the point of view of the model alium-

indued-alium-release is not neessarily involved into the presynapti alium dynamis at least

for this speial type of neuron.

We would like to emphasize that the single ation potential alium response has been produed

by (cid:28)tting only two parameters, i.e. the average membrane protein surfae densities of the VDCC

and the PMCA. All other parameters have been determined either by the experiment itself or

by independent experiments. The resulting values for the protein densities turn out to be rather

high but remain within a range of densities that has been observed in experiment (Khananshvili,

1998). One may think of inverting the line of argumentation and interprete the resulting protein

densities as predition for an average density on the whole bouton. In view of the di(cid:30)ulties to

measure suh densities this provides an attrative possibility.

The lassi(cid:28)ation of parameters into universal and spei(cid:28) ones opens the possibility to adjust

the model to other experiments without altering the model pillars. The (universal) properties of

the VDCC for example have been determined using orresponding single hannel experiments. In

this ontext one may think of the neessity to inlude more than one HVA hannel type into the

model instead of restriting oneself to one representative type. However, a orrespondng analysis

revealed that the resulting alium transients remain basially unhanged using two di(cid:27)erent HVA

hannels. We onlude that the measurement of alium transients does not allow to distinguish

between di(cid:27)erent HVA hannel subtypes. This may be di(cid:27)erent if onsidering LVA hannels in

the model.

We qualitatively investigated the general behaviour of alium transients in response to di(cid:27)erent

stimulation protools as used for the indution of LTE. For 2 Hz tetani we found no harateristi

feature of the alium signal that gives a hint how the indution of LTD is mirrored in the alium

transient. Either the alium signal does not ontain any information related to LTD indution

or we omitted an important proess in the model assumptions. One may think of the inativation

of VDCC whih ours on a time sale of seonds and whih therefore is a suitable proess to in-

hibit the alium response during LTD stimulations. On the other hand we found a harateristi

di(cid:27)erene between alium transients in response to LTD (2 Hz) and LTP (50 Hz) stimulations.

At some threshold stimulation frequeny the alium signal does not return to its rest state level

after eah spike. Instead a new baseline emerges on a higher level and the alium spikes develop

16

on top of this baseline. This general behaviour has been found in postsynapti experiments before

(Helmhen et al., 1996). Indeed, one knows that the stimulation strength has to overome some

threshold value in order to indue LTP (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993). One may interprete the

emergene of a new baseline level in the alium signal for above threshold stimulation frequenies

as the equivalent of the LTP stimulation threshold re(cid:29)eted on the intraellular alium onen-

tration. In other words, the emergene of an enhaned baseline in the alium onentration may

be thought of as a neessary requirement for LTP indution. This hypothesis is supported by the

observation that the new alium baseline appears for frequenies that are indeed in between the

indution frequenies for LTD and LTP. The height of the baseline inreases quadratially with

inreasing stimulation frequenies up to frequenies for whih the bu(cid:27)er beomes saturated with

alium. For higher frequenies the baseline inreases only linearly.

It is important to realize the strong in(cid:29)uene of indiators on the intraellular free alium

signal (Hansel et al., 1996; Hansel et al., 1997; Williams and Johnston, 1989). Therefore, we

investigated this problem in the framework of the model. On the level of single ation potentials

the use of indiator leads to onsiderably smaller alium spikes whih relaxed more slowly to the

rest onentration. This implies that the use of indiator shifts the above mentioned threshold

stimulation frequeny to lower values. Note, that these are rather large e(cid:27)ets. Therefore, a quan-

titative evaluation of (cid:29)uoresene measurements should always inlude the e(cid:27)et of the indiator.

The model presented here, provides a tool to reonstrut the alium transient as it would have

appeared without indiator from (cid:29)uoresene measurements. This has been done in this artile

for the experiment of (Koester and Sakmann, 2000). It would be interesting in future to make

use of the parameter lassi(cid:28)ation and to apply the model to other experiments, espeially when

using other neuron types. A omparative analysis of presynapti alium transients in di(cid:27)erent

neurons may reveal neuron-type spei(cid:28) harateristis of the alium dynamis.

Abstract

A time series model based on the global structure of the complete genome is
proposed. Three kinds of length sequences of the complete genome are considered.
The correlation dimensions and Hurst exponents of the length sequences are calcu-
lated. Using these two exponents, some interesting results related to the problem
of classiﬁcation and evolution relationship of bacteria are obtained.

1 Introduction

The nucleotide sequences stored in GenBank have exceeded hundreds of millions of bases
and they increase by ten times every ﬁve years. A great deal of information concerning
origin of life, evolution of species, development of individuals, and expression and regu-
lation of genes, exist in these sequences[1]. In the past decade or so there has been an
enormous interest in unravelling the mysteries of DNA. It has become very important
to improve on new theoretical methods to do DNA sequence analysis. Statistical analy-
sis of DNA sequences[1−9] using modern statistical measures is proven to be particularly
fruitful. There is another approach to research DNA, namely nonlinear scales method,
such as fractal dimension[10, 11, 12, 13], complexity[14, 16]. The correlation properties of
coding and noncoding DNA sequences was ﬁrst studied by Stanley and coworkers[5] in
their “fractal landscape or DNA walk” model. The DNA walk deﬁned in [5] is that the

walker steps “up” if a pyrimidine (C or T ) occurs at position i along the DNA chain,
while the walker steps “down” if a purine (A or G) occurs at position i. Stanley and
coworkers[5] discovered there exists long-range correlation in noncoding DNA sequences
while the coding sequences correspond to regular random walk. But if one considers more
details by distinguishing C from T in pyrimidine, and A from G in purine (such as two
or three dimensional DNA walk model[1] and maps given in [14]), then the presence of
base correlation has been found even in coding region. However, DNA sequences are more
complicated than those these types of analysis can describe. Therefore, it is crucial to
develop new tools for analysis with a view toward uncovering mechanisms used to code
other types of information.

Since the ﬁrst complete genome of the free-living bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium
was sequenced in 1995[17], an ever-growing number of complete genomes has been de-
posited in public databases. The availability of complete genomes opens the possibility to
ask some global questions on these sequences. The avoided and under-represented strings
in some bacterial complete genomes have been discussed in [13, 18, 19]. A time series
model of CDS in complete genome has also been proposed in [15].

One can ignore the composition of the four kind of bases in coding and noncod-
ing segments and only consider the roughly structure of the complete genome or long
DNA sequences. Provata and Almirantis [20] proposed a fractal Cantor pattern of DNA.
They map coding segments to ﬁlled regions and noncoding segments to empty regions of
random Cantor set and then calculate the fractal dimension of the random fractal set.
They found that the coding/noncoding partition in DNA sequences of lower organisms
is homogeneous-like, while in the higher eucariotes the partition is fractal. This result
is interesting and reasonable, but it seems too rough to distinguish bacteria because the
fractal dimensions of bacteria they gave out are all the same. The classiﬁcation and evo-
lution relationship of bacteria is one of the most important problem in DNA research. In
this paper, we propose a time series model based on the global structure of the complete
genome and we ﬁnd that one can get more information from this model than that of the
fractal Cantor pattern. We have found some new results to the problem of classiﬁcation
and evolution relationship of bacteria.

A DNA sequence is a sequence over the alphabet {A, C, G, T } representing the four
bases from which DNA is assembled, namely adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.
But from views of the level of structure, the complete genome of organism is made up of
coding and noncoding segments. Here the length of a coding/noncoding segment means
the number of its bases. First we simply count out the lengths of coding/noncoding
segments in the complete genome. Then we can get three kinds of integer sequences by
the following ways.

i) First we order all lengths of coding and noncoding segments according to the order
of coding and noncoding segments in the complete genome, then replace the lengths of
noncoding segments by their negative numbers. So that we can distinguish lengths of
coding and noncoding segments. This integer sequence is named whole length sequence.

Figure 1: Length and distribution of coding segments in the complete genome or Chro-
mosome of some organisms.

ii) We order all lengths of coding segments according to the order of coding segments
in the complete genome. We name this integer sequence coding length sequence. For some
examples, we plot the distribution of coding length sequences of three bacteria genome
and the 4th chromosome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) in Figure 1.

iii) We order all lengths of noncoding segments according to the order of noncoding
segments in the complete genome. This integer sequence is named noncoding length
sequence.

We can now view these three kinds of integer sequences as time series. We want to

calculate their correlation dimensions and Hurst exponents.

2 Correlation dimension and Hurst exponent

The notion of correlation dimension, introduced by Grassberger and Procaccia[21, 22],
suits well experimental situations, when only a single time series is available. It is now
being used widely in many branches of physical science. Consider a sequence of data from

3

a computer or laboratory experiment:

x1, x2, x3, · · · , xN ,

(1)

where N is a large enough number. These numbers are usually sampled at an equal time
interval ∆τ . We embed the time series into Rm, choose a time delay τ = p∆τ , then
obtain

yi = (xi, xi+p, xi+2p, · · · , xi+(m−1)p),

i = 1, 2, · · · , Nm,

where

Nm = N − (m − 1)p.

In this way we get Nm vectors in the embedding space Rm.

For any yi, yj, we deﬁne the distance as

rij = d(yi, yj) =

m−1

Xl=0

|xi+lp − xj+lp|.

(2)

(3)

(4)

If the distance is less than a given number r, we say that these two vectors are correlated.
The correlation integral is deﬁned as

Cm(r) =

1
N 2
m

Nm

Xi,j=1

H(r − rij),

where H is the Heaviside function

H(x) = ( 1,

0,

if x > 0,
if x ≤ 0.

(5)

(6)

For a proper choice of m and not too big a value of r, it has been shown by Grassberger
and Procaccia[22] that the correlation integral Cm(r) behaves like

Thus one can deﬁne the correlation dimension as

Cm(r) ∝ rD2(m).

D2 = lim

D2(m) = lim

ln Cm(r)

ln r

.

(7)

(8)

For more details on D2, the reader can refer to [23].

To deal with practical problems, one usually choose p = 1. If we choose a sequence
{ri : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} such that r1 < r2 < r3 < · · · < rn, then a scaling region can be found
in the ln r − ln Cm(r) plane, see [23], p.346. Then the slop of the scaling region is D2(m).
When D2(m) does not change with m increasing, we can take this D2(m0) as the estimate
value of D2. We calculate the correlation dimensions of three kinds of length sequences
of the complete genome using the method introduced above. From the ln r − ln Cm(r)
ﬁgures of these sequences of diﬀerent values of embedding dimension m, we ﬁnd that it is

suitable to choose m = 7. For example, we give the ln r − ln Cm(r) ﬁgure of whole length
sequence of A. fulgidus when m = 6, 7 (Figure 2). We take the region from the third
point to the 20th point (from left to right) as the scaling region.

Hurst[24] invented the now famous statistical method — the rescaled range analysis

(R/S analysis) to study the long-range dependence in time series. Later on, B. B. Mandelbrot[25]
and J. Feder [26] brought R/S analysis into fractal analysis. For any time series x =

using the least-squares linear ﬁt. As an example, we plot the graph of R/S analysis of
the whole length sequence of A. fulgidus in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Calculation of Hurst exponent.

The Hurst exponent is usually used as a measure of complexity. The trajectory of
the record is a curve with fractal dimension D = 2 − H ([25],p.149). Hence a smaller H
means a more complex system. When applied to fractional Brownian motion, the system
is said to be persistent if H > 1/2, which means that if for a given time period t, the
motion is along one direction, then in a succeeding time, it is more likely that the motion
will follow the same direction. For H < 1/2, the opposite holds, that is, the system is
antipersistent. But when H = 1/2, the system is a Brownian motion, and is random.

3 Data and results.

More than 21 bacterial complete genomes are now available in public databases .
There are ﬁve Archaebacteria: Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Pyrococcus abyssi, Methanococ-
cus jannaschii, Aeropyrum pernix and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum; four
Gram-positive Eubacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, My-
coplasma genitalium, and Bacillus subtilis. The others are Gram-negative Eubacteria.
These consist of two Hyperthermophilic bacteria: Aquifex aeolicus and Thermotoga mar-
itima; six proteobacteria: Rhizobium sp. NGR234, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus in-
ﬂuenzae, Helicobacter pylori J99, Helicobacter pylori 26695 and Rockettsia prowazekii;
two chlamydia Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and two Spirochete:
Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum.

We calculate the correlation dimensions and Hurst exponents of three kinds of length
sequences of the above 21 bacteria. The estimated results are given in Table 1 ( we denote

4 Discussion and conclusions

Although the existence of the archaebacterial urkingdom has been accepted by many
biologists, the classiﬁcation of bacteria is still a matter of controversy[27]. The evolu-
tionary relationship of the three primary kingdoms (i.e. archeabacteria, eubacteria and
eukaryote) is another crucial problem that remains unresolved[27].

From Table 1, we can roughly divide bacteria into two classes, one class with D2,cod less

than 2.40, and the other with D2,cod greater than 2.40. We observe that the classiﬁcation
of bacteria using D2,cod almost coincides with the traditional classiﬁcation of bacteria.
All Archaebacteria belong to the same class. All Proteobacteria belong to the same class
except Rhizobium sp. NGR234, in particular, the closest Proteobacteria Helicobacter
pylori 26695 and Helicobacter pylori J99 group with each other. Two Spirochete group
with each other. Two Chlamydia gather with each other. Gram-positive bacteria is
divided into two sub-categories: Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae
belong to one class and gather with each other, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Bacillus
subtilis belong to another class and almost gather with each other.

If one classiﬁes bacteria using D2,whole, with the D2,whole of one subclass less than 2.55,
that of the other larger than 2.55, almost the same results hold as those using D2,cod. But
when one classiﬁes bacteria using D2,noncod, the results are quite diﬀerent. This is quite
reasonable because the coding segments occupy the main part of space of the DNA chain
of bacteria.

A surprising feature shown in Table 1 is that the Hyperthermophilic bacteria (including
Aquifex aeolicus and Thermotoga maritima) are linked closely with the Archaebacteria
if we only consider the length sequences of noncoding segments. But when we consider
the length sequences of coding segments, they are linked closely with eubacteria. We
notice that Aquifex, like most Archaebacteria, is hyperthermophilic. Hence it seems that
their hyperthermophilicity property is possibly controlled by the noncoding part of the
genome, contrary to the traditional view resulting from classiﬁcation based on the coding
part of the genome.
It has previously been shown that Aquifex has close relationship
with Archaebacteria from the gene comparison of an enzyme needed for the synthesis of
the amino acid trytophan[28]. Such strong correlation on the level of complete genome
between Aquifex and Archaebacteria is not easily accounted for by lateral transfer and
other accidental events[28]. Our result is based on diﬀerent levels of the genome from that
used by the authors of [28]

From Table 1, one can also see the D2,cod values are almost larger than the D2,noncod
values. Hence the coding length sequences are more complex than the noncoding length
sequences.

From Table 2, we can also roughly divide bacteria into two classes, one class with Hcod
less than 0.60, and the other with Hcod greater than 0.60. One can see all Archeabacteria
belong to the same class except Pyrococcus abyssi. All Gram-positive Eubacteria belong
to the same class except Bacillus subtilis. All Proteobacteria belong to the same class
except Haemophilus inﬂuenzae. Two Spirochete group with each other. Two Chlamydia
almost group with each other.

We also ﬁnd the Hnoncod values of all Archeabacteria except Pyrococcus abyssi, two
Hyperthermophilic bacteria, and Mycoplasma genitalium and E. coli are less than 1/2,
while those of other bacteria are greater than 1/2. Hence Hyperthermophilic bacteria
have some common information with Archaebacteria in noncoding segments.

We calculate D2,whole, D2,cod, D2,noncod Hwhole, Hcod and Hnoncod of the 4th chromosome

9

of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). They are 2.5603, 2.1064, 2.5013, 0.5517, 0.6255 and
0.5482 respectively. From Tables 1 and 2, if we consider D2,whole, Hwhole and Hcod, we can
see that Archaebacteria and Chlamydia are linked more closely with yeast which belongs
to eukaryote than other categories of bacteria. There are several reports (such as [29])
that, in some RNA and protein species, archeabacteria are much more similar in sequences
to eukaryotes than to eubacteria. Our present result supports this point of view.

In [14], we ﬁnd that the Hurst exponent is a good tool to distinguish diﬀerent functional
regions. But now considering more global structure of the genome, we ﬁnd the correlation
dimension a better exponent to use for classiﬁcation of bacteria than the Hurst exponent
in this level.

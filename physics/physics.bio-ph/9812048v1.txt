the characteristic core geometry of two minimally frus-

trated sequence families. These families exploit separate

features of the internal architecture of the chain, which

are stabilized by either high (upper ﬁgure) or low (lower

ﬁgure) frequency of sequence domain alternation. Each

of the core structures in this ﬁgure have nearly eighty

percent of their hydrophobic pair interactions satisﬁed.

FIG. 2. Illustration of the anzatz used to construct

the sequence basis. The two sequences (1, 1) and (1, −1)

in the left column span an elemental basis for N = 2. To

construct the basis for N = 4, the basis for N = 2 is ﬁrst

replicated and placed in the small dashed boxes, multi-

plied by +1 or −1 as indicated by the symbols (+) and

(−) within each box. These sequences are then polymer-

ized along a vertical line extending below the number

22, which produces the basis (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, −1, −1),

(1, −1, 1, −1) and (1, −1, −1, 1) for N = 4. The same

procedure can be repeated to generate the basis for

N = 24 . . . 2n as discussed in the text.

The parameter α(pν ) ≡ α is half the number of domain

boundaries between +1 and −1 residues along the length

of the basis sequence. Large α corresponds to a high

frequency of alternation between the two residue types.

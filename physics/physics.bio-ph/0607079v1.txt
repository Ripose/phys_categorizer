Abstract

The ﬂuidic behavior of water at the micro/nano scale is studied by using of single DNA molecules

as a model system. Stable curved DNA patterns with spans about one micron were generated by

using of water ﬂows, and observed by Atomic Force Microscopy. By rigorously comparing the

numerical simulation results with these patterns, it is suggested that the form of the macroscopic

hydrodynamic equation still works quantitatively well on the ﬂuid ﬂows at the nanoscale. The

molecular eﬀects, however, are still apparent that the eﬀective viscosity of the adjacent water

is considerably larger than its bulk value. Our observation is also helpful to understand of the

dynamics of biomolecules in solutions from nanoscale to microscale.

Novel micro-ﬂuidics has provided new possibilities for the development of fabricating

high-performance devices with micrometer or even submicrometer dimensions [1, 2, 3], as

well as bio-processing for bio-medical analysis [4]. The ability to control accurately the

ﬂow requires the understanding of ﬂuid ﬂows at the micro/nano scale near macromolecules

or above solid surfaces. Recent experiments have shown that macroscopic hydrodynamics

can reliably describe the ﬂow of ﬂuids through channels with cross-sectional dimensions

that range from tens to hundreds of micrometers [5]. The nanometer scale, however, is in

the transition regime between continuum and molecule dominated conditions [2, 6], about

which we know very little [6]. Molecular dynamics has been used to study the nanoﬂuid

[7] and consistence between the numerical results from molecular dynamics and Navier-

Stokes equations has been obtained recently [8]. However, both high and normal ‘eﬀective’

viscosities, its departure from the bulk value usually characterizing the molecular eﬀects,

and boundary slip have been observed in the conﬁned water when the sample thickness is

comparable to or below the diameter of DNA molecules [9], indicating that the dynamics

of nanoﬂuid should be much complex. Moreover, it has been found experimentally that the

water ﬂow through oriﬁces with diameter about 8 µm is considerably diﬀerent from that of

ordinary size [10]. At a hydrophobic surface, in an unexpectedly extended (∼ 4 nm) water

layer, the density of water has a noticeable reduction (85-90% of the density of bulk water)

[11]. Consequently, the ﬂuidity of water several to tens of nanometers above non-liquid

materials should be diﬀerent from that of the macroscopic systems despite the fact that the

water molecules are much smaller.

The diﬃculty in the experimental studies is partially due to the limited experimental tech-

nologies to obtain data that can be compared by theoretical predictions quantitatively. Al-

though molecules with ﬂuorescent labels have been widely used [12] to make the biomolecules

visible, the resolution is limited by the minimal photon wavelength, which is about half a mi-

cron. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Electronic Microscopy (EM) have the nanometer

resolution. However, they require the objects to be ﬁxed on solid substrates. It is obviously

questionable that the quantitative details on the dynamics can be exploited from motionless

objects unless they are in steady-states, which are diﬃcult to be conﬁrmed.

The study of biological systems will continue to inspire the development of new physics

[13] and the dynamics of DNA in ﬂuid ﬂow has been extensively studied by various methods

[12, 14]. Thanks to the elastic behavior of DNA ﬁbers that they reach maximal lengthes with

2

a tension larger than ∼65 pN [15] and are not broken until 400 pN [16], those overstretched

DNA ﬁbers can reach steady states in the ﬂuid ﬂows and be ﬁxed on substrates. In this

Letter a simple experiment was then set up to obtain steady curved DNA patterns for

span lengths about or less than 1 µm, generated by water ﬂow. By rigorously comparing

the observed DNA patterns with theoretical predictions, it is suggested that macroscopic

hydrodynamic equations still works quantitatively well on the ﬂuid ﬂow at the nanoscale at

least at steady states. To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on the applicability of

the Navier-Stokes equations on the ﬂuidic behavior of water near single DNA molecules at

the nanoscale by testing the numerical predictions with the experimental observation.

The λDNA, purchased from Sigma Co. (USA), was diluted before use to a concentration

of 3 ng/µl with TE buﬀer (40 mMol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mMol/L EDTA, pH 8.0). The experiment

began by depositing a drop of 10 µl λDNA solution onto a mica sheet modiﬁed by APTES

[17] that was placed on a rotary device. The distance between the drops of λDNA solution

and the axis of the rotary device was always about 10 mm. The spin speed of rotation is

kept to be 1150 rpm. After rotation, the drop would be thrown oﬀ and some DNA molecules

were aligned on the surface. To demonstrate that DNA molecules were aligned by water ﬂow

rather than the liquid-gas interface, some DNA ﬁbers were observed by Tapping-Mode AFM

(Nanoscope IIIa, Veeco Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) using silicon tips (Silicon-MDT

Ltd., Russia) [3]. It is found that the relative extensions of those aligned DNA molecules

are within 100% ± 5% while those are about 133% to 150% in the molecular combing by the

receding meniscus [16, 18]. Then another drop of water was placed on the same area of the

surface on which there are aligned DNA molecules while the orientation of the mica sheet
on the rotary device was changed about 90o. A subsequent rotation created a second ﬂow

on the mica surface, approximately perpendicular to the ﬁrst one. The velocity of the drop

was estimated to be about 1 cm/s, with an upper limit of 3 cm/s. The as-generated DNA

patterns were revealed by Tapping-mode AFM [3].

We have systematically observed over 100 curves with span length L, 50 nm < L < 2

µm after the second water ﬂow, as typically shown in Fig. 1. Some of the DNA segments

still have their original aligned patterns, while other segments bend in the direction of the

second water ﬂow. Among them, 7 symmetric curves are constituted of those overstretched

DNA ﬁbers, which reach their maximal lengthes, with span length ranging from ∼580 nm

to ∼1260 nm. The fact that the ratio of the contour and the span is about 1.75 for those

FIG. 1: DNA patterns obtained by AFM imaging. Some of the DNA segments still keep their

original aligned patterns, while some segments bend to the moving direction of liquid ﬂow and

form wave-like patterns. The curves denoted by red dots are the theoretical predictions ℜ from our

numerical calculation which agree extremely well with the curves from the experiment. The light

magenta arrows are only served as a guide to eyes rather than the exact directions of the second

water ﬂows. The blue dots in the inset are the data extracted from the DNA pattern and the red

line is the theoretical prediction ℜ.

overstretched patterns further veriﬁes that DNA molecules are aligned and curved by water

ﬂows rather than the interface. The relative extension is calculated from the contour and

the span length L of a curve. In the following we will demonstrate that these symmetric and

steady DNA curves are a result of the balance of the macroscopic hydrodynamic forces with

an adjusted viscosity, as illustrated by the 5 typical examples shown in Fig. 1, i.e., curve 2

in (a) and curves 1, 2, 3, 5 in (b). The other patterns, including the asymmetric curve 1 in

Fig. 1(a) and the double-peaked curve 4 in Fig. 1(b), have been initially analyzed in [19]

and will be discussed in details elsewhere.

The numerical analysis is based on the bead-spring model [20]. To test whether the

macroscopic hydrodynamic equations still works quantitatively well, the forces acting on

4

the beads are computed by simulating water ﬂow according to the Navier-Stokes equations.

Explicitly, the lattice Boltzmann simulation [21] is applied to simulate the water ﬂow around

the spherical beads. A non-slip boundary condition [22] is applied at the bead-ﬂuid bound-

aries. The momentum exchange [23, 24] at the solid-ﬂuid interface is used to determine the

force acting on the DNA beads. In the lattice Boltzmann simulations, the non-dimensional

radius of each bead is 5.2 lattice units and the relaxation time τ = 0.75. The density and
kinetic viscosity of the water are 998.3kg/m3 and 1.007×10−6m2/s [25], respectively.

FIG. 2: The system for our numerical simulation together with the coordinates. The red circles

Fig. 2

are the beads placed on the DNA pattern scaled down from the curve marked by 2 in Fig. 1(a).

The black arrows represent the directions and magnitudes of the hydrodynamic forces on the beads

obtained by numerical simulations. There are three forces acting on the DNA segment between C

(x = 0) and x = δx: the tension TC at C along the x-axis, the tension T1 at the other end of

the segment and the hydrodynamic force fh(δx) on this segment, which can be computed from the

hydrodynamic force distribution.

Let us take the curve marked by 2 in Fig. 1(a) as an example. The settings of our

numerical simulations are shown in Fig. 2. Some beads, say sixty-nine, were placed on the

DNA pattern scaled down from the curve. The radius of each bead is 1 nm, approximately

equal to that of the DNA strands, while the center-to-center distance between the nearest-

neighbor beads is always 2.308 nm. Periodic boundary conditions are applied for the x and

5

z directions. The mesh sizes are: Lx is a little larger than the span length L of the DNA

pattern, the inlet and outlet in y direction is always 30.5 nm from the closest bead, see, e.g.,

Lx = 95.5 nm and Ly = 120.0 nm for L=90.9 nm; Lz=41.1 nm. It is found that Lz is large

enough so that the eﬀect of the periodic boundary condition in the z direction is negligible.

The ﬂuid velocity at the inlet and outlet is assumed to be 1 cm/s and along the -y direction

at all time.

the DNA ﬁber.

The force distribution acting on beads is shown in Fig. 2. Since the actual DNA ﬁber is

continuous rather than discrete, we therefore used the best continuum curve ﬁtting from the

calculated discrete force to approximate the realistic hydrodynamic force distribution along

It is evident that if a DNA ﬁber is in a steady state of the hydrodynamic force, the total

force, i.e., the sum of the hydrodynamic force and the tensions, acting on any segment of

the DNA ﬁber should vanish. Unfortunately, the tension is unknown and it is diﬃcult to

measure the velocity of water ﬂow acting on the DNA molecules to an acceptable accuracy

so that we cannot examine the equilibrium condition explicitly. However, if we assume that

the coordinates of the two ends of the DNA at locations C and O (see Fig. 2) are given,

then the hydrodynamic force distribution obtained above will uniquely determine a curve ℜ.

Further, ℜ can be used to compare with the experimental result. If these two curves coincide

with each other, the DNA pattern obtained by the experiment is indeed in the steady state

of the hydrodynamic force. Otherwise the discrepancy reﬂects the special behavior at the

nanoscale.

To construct the curve ℜ, we start our steady force balance calculation from the critical

point C as shown in Figure 2. Assuming that there is a small displacement δx in the x-

direction, then there are three forces acting on the DNA segment between C (x = 0) and

x = δx: the tension TC at C along the x-direction, the tension T1 at the other end of the

segment and the hydrodynamic force fh(δx) on this segment. δx = 0.5 nm was used in our

calculations. For the equilibrium state, the force balance for the DNA segment gives:

TC + T1 + fh(δx) = 0.

(1)

If we assume that the magnitude of |TC| is TC, both the magnitude and direction of the

tension T1 can be obtained through Eq. 1. Consequently we can obtain the y coordinate

of the DNA segment at x = δx. Next, we consider the position of the curve ℜ at x = 2δx.

6

The tangential direction at this point can be obtained similarly to ﬁnd the increment of

y value from x = δx to x = 2δx. This extrapolation process can be repeated until xo is

reached. Then an iterative process is used to self-consistently determine TC to meet the

value yo required at O. In this way, we obtain the curve ℜ. It should be noted that the force

to bend the DNA molecules to the curves shown in Fig. 1, except for the parts near the

anchored points, is about 0.1 pN, negligibly smaller than the tension in the DNA curves.

ℜ is displayed as red circles in Fig. 1(a). To our great surprise it is found that ℜ from our

theoretical prediction agrees extremely well with the curve from the experiment. Numerical

simulations for 35, 49 and 89 beads, corresponding to span lengths L = 45.1, 63.6, and 116.6

nm, respectively, have also been carried out. It is found that the normalized patterns from

numerical predictions with diﬀerent length scales can be normalized to a high accuracy. In

the same way, we obtain the theoretical predictions ℜ for the curves 1, 2, 3, 5 in Fig. 1(b).

In order to obtain a quantitative comparison between the numerical predictions and the

experimental results, the global relative error is computed from those 5 curves, which is 5

± 1 %.

The tension TC at the critical point C from our calculations for diﬀerent L is shown in

Fig. 3, which ﬁts very well to a linear function TC = 0.0156L when the inlet ﬂuid velocity

equals 1 cm/s. Following this linear scaling, we found that TC = 9.0 and 19.7 pN for L = 580

and 1260 nm, respectively.

The tensions are larger than 65 pN [15] in the overstretched DNA ﬁbers with relative

extension about 1.75. However, TC calculated for L = 580 nm is only 9.0 pN. Even for the

upper limit of the velocity, 3 cm/s, of the water drop, TC = 27.0 pN is still smaller than 65

pN. We also note that the viscosity of water is the same as its bulk value in the calculation.

If we assume that the local eﬀective viscosity near the DNA ﬁber is more than 3 times of its

bulk value, the calculated tension in all the 7 steady and symmetric curved DNA patterns

will be larger than 65 pN. Enhanced by a factor of 6 for the eﬀective viscosity of water near

proteins has been also observed recently [26]. In the inset of Fig. 3, we have included the

tension distribution along the DNA ﬁber for L of 1260 nm.

The numerical analysis in the manuscript has neglected the fact that DNA ﬁbers are close

to the mica surface. It has shown that polymer molecules can move on the surface with a

low barrier although the absorption on molecules by the surface is strong [27]. Therefore,

we believe the interaction between the extended DNA strands and the substrate will not

lengths, and their linear ﬁt function. The inset is the tension distribution along the DNA ﬁber for

change the conclusion we obtain above. In this case the ﬂow around the DNA ﬁbers may be

a shear ﬂow. We have performed new numerical simulations. The distance from the x − y

plane, where the DNA curve located, to a non-slip boundary is ζ. The velocity of the ﬂow at

the inlet increases linearly from the boundary whereas the velocity in the line with the x − y

plane is 1 cm/s. The other settings are the same as before. It is found that the normalized

patterns ℜ obtained in this way for ζ = 3.84 nm and 0.58 nm are consistent with those

obtained above perfectly, while the tensions increase by a factor of 1.2 and 2.6 separately.

The ﬂuid velocity near wall is usually much smaller than that of the drop of water, therefore

higher eﬀective viscosity is also demanded.

The accuracy of the ﬁtting of the theoretical predictions to the experimental patterns is

at the level of AFM resolution, about 10-20 nm. This observation suggests that the force

exerted by the adjacent water on the DNA ﬁber can be determined quantitatively by the

macroscopic hydrodynamic equations at least in the steady state even at a resolution of

about 20 nm. The viscosity of the adjacent water, however, is much larger than its bulk

8

value. It should be noted that the excellent agreement between our numerical predictions

and the experimental results further demonstrate the robustness of the numerical model

although the detail of the experiment should be much complex.

A model of postphotodissociative monomolecular (gemi-
nate) recombination of heme proteins with small ligands (N O,
O2 or CO) is represented. The non-exponential decay with
time for the probability to ﬁnd a heme in unbound state is
interpreted in terms of diﬀusion-like migration of ligand be-
tween protein cavities. The temporal behavior for the proba-
bility is obtained from numerical simulation and speciﬁed by
two parameters: the time τ reb of heme-ligand rebinding for
the ligand localized inside the heme pocket and the time τ esc
of ligand escape from the pocket. The model is applied in
the analysis of available experimental data for geminate re-
oxygenation of human hemoglobin HbA. Our simulation is in
good agreement with the measurements. The analysis shows
that the variation in pH of the solution (6.0 < pH < 9.4)
results in considerable changes for τ reb from 0.36 ns (at
pH = 8.5) up to 0.5 ns (pH = 6.0) but eﬀects slightly on
the time τ esc (τesc ≈ 0.88 ns).

I. INTRODUCTION

The binding reactions between myoglobin (M b) or
hemoglobin (Hb) and small ligands (N O, O2 or CO) are
objects of extensive investigations during many decades
because of the great functional importance of the heme
proteins for living systems [1–3].
In the investigations
a special attention is paid to the heme-ligand recombi-
nation process going after fast photodissociative bond
breaking between a ligand molecule and an ion F e + +
located in the center of a heme (F e-protoporphyrin IX
complex). The kinetic study of the postphotodissocia-
tive recombination allows to obtain detailed information
on the protein-ligand interaction mechanism, the protein
structure, the allosteric eﬀect and the medium inﬂuence
on the recombination eﬃciency (see, for example, refer-
ences [4–9]).

The heme is well-wrapped in protein helixes, which
prevent the iron from the solvent and hinder the ligand
migration through protein matrix. On a suﬃciently long
time scale (at t ≤ 100 ns in the case of Hb) after dissocia-
tion, when the ligand is not managed to leave the protein
and to move signiﬁcantly away from the parent heme, the
recombination is a monomolecular reaction designated
usually as a geminate recombination (GR) [5]. Schemat-
ically, the GR can be written as [10]:

kreb←− B

kesc←→ {C1, . . . , Cn}

A

(1)

where A is the bound heme-ligand state. The substates
B and {C1, . . . , Cn} form the unbound state. Each of
these substates corresponds to ligand localization in an
individual cavity of protein. The substate B answers to
the residence of ligand inside the heme pocket (the cavity
nearest to the iron on the distal side of heme). The rate
constants kreb and kesc specify two competing processes:
the irreversible heme-ligand rebinding for the ligand lo-
calized inside the heme pocket (that is, the transition
from the substate B to the state A) and the migration of
unbound ligand between the heme pocket and other pro-
tein cavities (the transitions between B and the substates
{C1, . . . , Cn}). Immediately after photodissociation the
unbound ligand is in the substate B. Therefore the quan-
tity kesc can be associated with ligand escape from the
pocket. In general, the GR is essentially determined by
the speciﬁcities of heme-ligand interaction (including the
spin restriction eﬀect, the position and the orientation
of ligand with respect to the heme plane) [5,11–13] and
the eﬀect of residues surrounding the heme [14–19]. Im-
portant factors for the heme-ligand rebinding are also
the state of tertiary [2,20–22] and quaternary [2,23–25]
structures of protein, the conformation transitions in pro-
tein [2,10,26–28] and the solvent impact [23,29–31]. As
a consequence, the kinetic curve (that is, the probabil-
ity P (t) to ﬁnd the heme in unbound state) of GR is
a non-exponentially decaying function of time [32–35].
After realization of the geminate stage a portion Ps of
the hemes remains in unbound state: Ps ≤ 0.01 for N O,
Ps ∼ 0.1 ÷ 0.2 for O2 and Ps ∼ 0.5 ÷ 1.0 for CO. The
quantity Ps characterizes the eﬃciency of ligand escape
from the protein to the solvent.

Molecular dynamics simulations [11,36–40] show that
the movement of unbound N O, O2 or CO ligands in
heme protein can be associated both with ligand trap-
ping for a signiﬁcant time in individual cavities and with
rare jump-like transitions between adjacent cavities. It
implies a fast establishment of equilibrium for the prob-
ability distribution of ligand within individual cavities.
The establishment occurs on a time scale comparable to
the mean time interval τw between the collisions of ligand
with cavity walls. At room temperatures the time τw lies
in the subpicosecond range (τw ∼ 0.1 ps for N O in the
heme pocket of M b [41]). The ligand redistribution be-
tween protein cavities is observed on a longer time scale
ranging from several tens of picoseconds (∼ 40 ps for N O
in M b [41]) up to several tens of nanoseconds (∼ 50 ns for

1

CO in Hb [42]). Unfortunately, in practice the detailed
molecular dynamics simulation can not be implemented
to the GR due to enormous computational eﬀorts.

In the study we apply an alternative approach based on
the diﬀusion approximation to ligand migration in pro-
tein. Such an approximation is valid for times t ≫ τw
when the deterministic nature of ligand motion can be
ignored. Here the interval τw can be recognized as a
correlation time. The diﬀusion-like character of ligand
migration in the heme proteins can be a reason of the
non-exponential temporal dependence for the probability
P (t) [43–45]. For instance, a two-dimensional diﬀusion
is demonstrated for CO in M b [45] to explain the power-
law kinetics to be observed in the experiment. Generally,
reaction (1) can be represented in a three-dimensional
diﬀusion approximation by equation

∂n
∂t

= ∇ (D∇n) − Rrebn

(2)

with the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = D(x, y, z). The quan-
tity n = n(x, y, z, t) is the probability density of un-
bound ligand in the protein. The stepwise function
Rreb = Rreb(x, y, z) speciﬁes the heme-ligand rebinding
and equals to kreb inside the heme pocket or to zero oth-
erwise.

In order to solve diﬀusion equation (2) and to follow
the evolution of GR we use a simple model proposed re-
cently in [46]. The model reproduces dynamics of random
walk of particle in porous media (such, for instance, as
glass-like matrices [47–49]) and takes into account an ini-
tial retention of ligand inside the heme pocket (that is, in
the substate B). In the absence of heme-ligand rebinding
the substate B is realized at times t < τesc (τesc = 1/kesc
is the time of ligand escape from the heme pocket to
others cavities). Only on a longer time scale (t > τesc)
the ligand succeeds to leave the pocket and to migrate
over protein cavities. Due to the diﬀusion nature of the
migration the time τesc can be speciﬁed in terms of the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient D.

The approach is implemented with the help of a numer-
ical simulation where the unbound ligand is represented
by a structureless particle. For simplicity, in the simula-
tion we make some assumptions. The ligand migration is
assumed to be restricted to the distal side of heme. The
ligand motion (realized on a short time scale t ≤ τw)
inside the heme pocket is represented by a unforced dis-
placement of the particle within a restricted hemispheric
region of space. At τw ≪ t ≪ τesc the ligand trajec-
tories are eﬀectively mixed in the conﬁgurational space,
resulting in a homogeneous distribution for the ligand
inside the cavities. Hence, the probability of irreversible
heme-ligand rebinding is accepted to be uniform for the
whole heme pocket. We take into account also that on
the time scale t ≫ τw the fast intracavity displacements
of ligand for the substates {C1, . . . , Cn} do not inﬂuence
essentially on the GR kinetics and can be ignored in the

simulation. Therefore the ligand displacement exterior
to the heme pocket is simulated as a random walk (that
is, as a Brownian-like motion) of the particle outside the
hemispheric region. This walk is a spatially homogeneous
diﬀusion with the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D. We neglect also
the structural transformations (such as a shift of the iron
with respect to the porphyrin ring plane) at the confor-
mational transition of protein between the unliganded
and liganded states. According to the model, the tem-
poral behavior for the probability P (t) can be speciﬁed
in terms of two parameters: the time τesc and the time
τreb = 1/kreb of heme-ligand rebinding. The description
of the model is represented in Section 2.

In order to demonstrate the usefulness of such an ap-
proach to the GR of heme proteins we apply the model to
the analysis of available experimental data. We analyze
the measured recombination kinetics and the eﬃciency
for a postphotodissociative GR of human hemoglobin
HbA [50,51]. These measurements were carried out at
various pH values of the solution. Here we determine the
times τreb and τesc as functions of pH and estimate the
inﬂuence of solution properties on the heme-oxygen re-
binding, the migration of oxygen molecule in hemoglobin
and the eﬃciency of oxygen escape from the protein. The
association of the times τreb and τesc with the time of a
bimolecular recombination process for hemoglobin is an-
alyzed. The results of simulation and their analysis are
represented in Section 3.

II. DIFFUSION-BASED MODEL OF GEMINATE
RECOMBINATION

The movement of unbound ligand is considered in a
Cartesian coordinate system xyz attached rigidly to the
heme group of atoms. The system origin is superposed
on an iron atom located in the middle of heme porphyrin
ring. The x and y axes are aligned with the heme plane.
The positive direction for the z axis corresponds to the
distal side of heme. The ligand migration in protein is
simulated as a probability redistribution for the ensemble
of structureless particles over a three-dimensional hemi-
spheric space with z > 0. As in [52], in our simulation
the heme pocket is represented by a hemispheric region
(designated here as a cage) of radius ρ. At an initial
time instant the particle is uniformly distributed inside
the cage.

The individual particle to be exposed to a sequence of
δ-shaped uncorrelated kicks executes a random walk in
the space. As for the Brownian particle, each kick results
in an abrupt change in the particle velocity. Between the
kicks the particle is in unforced motion. On a time inter-
val ∆tk = tk+1 − tk (tk is the time instant of action for
k-th kick) between adjacent kicks the particle is speciﬁed
by the velocity vk and the length Lk of free path (note
that ∆tk = Lk/ |vk| ). Then the radius vector r(tk+1) of

2

particle for the time point of k+1-th kick can be obtained
from iteration procedure

r (tk+1) = r (tk) +

Lkvk
|vk|

where the radius vector r(tk)is given for the time instant
of k-th kick. The projections vj,k (j = x, y, z) of the
velocity vk onto the coordinate axes and the length Lk
are accepted to be independent random quantities, new
values of which are generated at each kick. The quantities
vj,k is obtained from the Maxwell distribution

PM (vj,k) =

m
2πkT

r

exp

−

 

mv2
j,k
2kT !

Here m is the particle mass and T is a protein tempera-
ture. At an attainment of the z = 0 plane bounding the
space, a new particle velocity with vz > 0 is regenerated
in accordance with distribution (4).

The choice of free path length is dictated by the parti-
cle location in the space. Within the hemispheric cage the
particle displacement is unforced and the particle under-
goes no kicks. The length Lk is determined then from the
ballistic trajectory of particle between the cage bound-
aries. In this case the length is comparable to the cage
size ρ. We accept here that the mean time τh = h∆th,ki,
during which the particle crosses the cage, can be asso-
ciated with the time interval τw between the collisions of
ligand with heme pocket walls: τh ∼ τw.

Exterior to the cage, the particle is exposed to uncorre-
lated kicks. The absence of correlation between the kicks
implies that the quantity Lk is distributed according to
the exponential law:

P (Lk) =

exp

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where λ = hLki is the mean length of free path for the
particle displacement outside of the cage. The mean time
τc between adjacent kicks and the length λ are related to
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = hL2

Thus, the spatial displacement of the particle is ob-
tained from iterative equation of motion (3) and depends
on the random sampling of variables vx,k, vy,k, vz,k and
Lk, the statistical distributions for which are speciﬁed by
the parameters m/T , D and ρ. As mentioned above, un-
der the conditions typical for the heme proteins (that is,
the temperature, the ligand mass and the distinctive sizes
of heme pocket) the times τc and τh to be accepted here

as correlation times are negligibly short as compared to
the characteristic times of GR. The length λ is essentially
small as against the size ρ of hemispheric cage. Hence,
the temporal behavior for the probability redistribution
of ligand in heme protein can be described in terms of
the diﬀusion-based approach.

Our model reproduces dynamics of ligand migration
over protein cavities. Initially, the ligand is retained in-
side the heme pocket and the root-mean-square displace-
2
h|r(t) − r(0)|

i of ligand from the initial
ment S(t) =
position does not exceed the characteristic size of the
pocket. In a sense such a retention is analogous to the so
called cage-eﬀect to be observed for single atoms or small
molecules in porous glass-like matrices [47–49]. The time
scale, on which the retention is realized, is limited by
a time point τesc. This time is a lifetime for the lig-
and inside the heme pocket in the absence of rebinding
and speciﬁes thereby a ligand escape from the pocket.
Only on a longer time scale (when the ligand succeeds
to leave the pocket and to migrate over the protein) the
ligand displacement S(t) starts to increase signiﬁcantly.
According to the model, we associate the time τesc with
the time of particle localization in the hemispheric cage.
In the simulation the particle displacement S(t) does not
exceed the cage radius ρ on the short time scale t < τesc.
At longer times the quantity S(t) increases with time.
Due to the diﬀusion nature of the particle displacement
the increase in S(t)2 is a linear function of time and
S(t)2 ≈ 6Dt at t ≫ τesc. The relation between the time
τesc and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D can be then deter-
mined from the requirement ρ2 ∼ S(τesc)2 = 6Dτesc:

τesc =

Fig.
for the relative particle displacement S(t)2/ρ2 simulated
within the framework of our model. The displacement
S(t) is shown in the ﬁgure to be constant (S(t) ∼ ρ)
at τh ≪ t ≪ τesc. On a longer time scale (t ≫ τesc)
the quantity S(t) approaches asymptotically the diﬀusion
law: S(t)2 ≈ 6Dt = tρ2/τesc. Notice that for the time
scale τh ≪ t ≪ τesc the temporal behavior of relative
displacements S(t)/ρ is speciﬁed by the only parameter
τesc. In the following, we will adjust the parameter τesc
in the simulation. For deﬁniteness, this adjustment will
be carried out by means of variation in the diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient D. The particle mass m, the temperature T and
the cage radius ρ will take ﬁxed values typical for the
ligand and the protein.

The heme-ligand rebinding is accepted to be an irre-
versible process occurring when the ligand is localized
inside the heme pocket. Therefore this process is sim-
ulated as a random ’death’ for the particle within the
hemispheric cage. The particle with |r(tk)| < ρ is ’oblit-
erated’ if ξk ≤ ∆th,k/τreb. Here ξk is a random quantity

to be generated for each period ∆th,k when the particle
crosses the cage. The quantity ξk is distributed uniformly
in the interval [0, 1]. The ’obliterated’ particle is excluded
from the following consideration.

The probability P (t) to ﬁnd the heme in unbound state
is found as the ensemble-averaged relative number of the
’non-obliterated’ particles at a time instant t.
In con-
trast to the relative displacement S(t)/ρ, the temporal
behavior for the probability P (t) depends not only on the
diﬀusion properties, but on the rate of heme-ligand re-
binding as well. Hence, the behavior of P (t) can be spec-
iﬁed in terms of the times τesc and τreb. In general, the
probability P (t) is a monotonously decreasing function
of time, which approaches asymptotically a steady value
Ps at t → ∞. This value gives a portion of the hemes
remaining in unbound state after realization of GR. As
in diﬀusion equation (2), in our model the quantity Ps
is a function dependent merely on the ratio between τesc
and τreb. The analysis of simulated data shows that for a
wide range of values τesc and τreb satisfying the require-
ment τreb/τesc < 20 (that is, under conditions typical for
the GR) the best approximation of the dependence can
be represented by relation

III. GEMINATE RECOMBINATION OF HUMAN
HEMOGLOBIN WITH OXYGEN

We use the described model in order to analyze avail-
able experimental data for a postphotodissociative reoxy-
genation of human hemoglobin HbA. The data include
the measured recombination kinetics and the eﬃciency
of oxygen escape from the protein to the solvent for the
monomolecular (geminate) and bimolecular stages of re-
combination reaction

Hb (O2)3 + O2 −→ Hb (O2)4

(10)

going at room temperatures after fast laser-initiated
breaking of a F e−O2 bond [51,51]. The kinetic measure-
ments are carried out with a time resolution of 10 ps for
a time scale t < 1.5 ns at diﬀerent ﬁxed pH values for the
solution. The values of pH fall within an interval between
6.0 and 9.4: pH = {6.0, 6.8, 7.0, 7.2, 7.7, 8.0, 8.5, 9.4}.

According to the model, in the analysis of reoxygena-
tion reaction (10) the temporal decay for the probability
P (t) is interpreted as a result of two competing processes:
the heme-oxygen rebinding for the oxygen molecule local-
ized inside the heme pocket and the diﬀusion-like migra-
tion of the oxygen between hemoglobin cavities. Here
we determine the times τreb and τesc, which specify the
processes. We determine the times as functions of pH
and analyze the eﬀect of solution properties on the pro-
cesses to be considered. Due to the tetramer arrange-
ment of hemoglobin (the Hb molecule consists of heme
containing α- and β-chains) the observed kinetic curve
represents a reoxygenation kinetics summarized over the
chains. Here we make no distinction for reaction (10) be-
tween the α- and β-chains and determine thereby chain-
averaged times.

A. Reoxygenation kinetics for hemoglobin

for

The analysis of

reoxygenation kinetics

the
hemoglobin is based on the estimation of the times τreb
and τesc. The times are found with the help of a nu-
merical simulation, the iterative procedure for which is
described above (see Section 2).
In the simulation the
masse of walking particle is accepted to equal the mass
of oxygen molecule. The temperature T is 300K. The
size ρ of hemispheric cage is 4 ˚Athat corresponds to the
time τh < 1 ps. The times τreb and τesc are chosen from
an interval of values from 0.1 up to 5 ns. The corre-
lation time τc and the mean length λ of free path are
determined by relations (6) and (7). They are negligibly
small in comparison with τreb, τesc or ρ. The simulated
dependences for the probability P (t) are obtained from
ensemble averaging for more than 106 particles.

In the simulation the parameters τreb and τesc are
so adjusted that the ensemble-averaged temporal depen-
dence of simulated probability P (t) is the best agreement
with a measured kinetic curve. The agreement is spec-
iﬁed by the relative root-mean-square deviation R be-
tween the simulated and experimental curves. The simu-
lated dependence for P (t) is shown in Fig. 2 to reproduce
well kinetic measurements on the considered time scale.
The minimal deviation R achieved in our calculations for
each of the ﬁxed pH values does not exceed the mea-
surement error (R ≤ 0.01). Such an agreement testiﬁes
that the non-exponential dependence for P (t) with time
can be explained by a diﬀusion-like migration of ligand
over protein matrix. Hence, the parameters τreb and τesc
can be used for the analysis of the processes, which are
responsible for the GR.

FIG. 2. A temporal dependence for the probability P (t)
to ﬁnd the heme in unbound state after fast breaking of a
F e − O2 bond in human hemoglobin HbA for the geminate
stage of reaction (10) at pH = 6.0 (solid line - our simulation
with τreb = 0.495 ns and τesc = 0.84 ns, ∆ - experiment [50])
and 8.5 (dashed line - our simulation with τreb = 0.366 ns and
τesc = 0.92 ns, ◦ - experiment [50]) .

The inﬂuence of solution properties on the migration
and the rebinding of oxygen molecule in hemoglobin is
assessed from a pH dependence for the obtained times
τreb and τesc. Our simulation demonstrates a signiﬁcant
variation in the rate of heme-oxygen rebinding with pH
(see Fig. 3). The increase of quantity pH from 6.0 to 8.5
results in a shortening for the time τreb by a factor of 1.4
(from 0.5 down to 0.36 ns). With the following rise of pH
to 9.4 the parameter τreb appears to increase up to 0.4 ns.
The minimum magnitude of τreb is observed at pH = 8.5.
Despite the considerable pH eﬀect for the heme-oxygen
rebinding, the variation in pH inﬂuences slightly on the
oxygen escape from the heme pocket. The time τesc is
shown in Fig. 3 to be within a range of values from
0.82 to 0.92 ns and to be weakly dependent on pH. The

tion reaction (10). The inset shows the pH-dependence (∆)
obtained in our simulation for the time τesc of oxygen escape
from the heme pocket of HbA.

The obtained values for the times τreb and τesc are
in good agreement with the experimental study of the
alkaline Bohr eﬀect (the variation of the recombination
rate 1/τs with pH for the bimolecular stage of GR)
[50,51]. The behavior of pH-dependence for the time
τreb is demonstrated in Fig. 3 to be similar to one for
the time τs of bimolecular rebinding. Such an agree-
ment testiﬁes that for the monomolecular GR the vari-
ation of the rebinding rate with pH can be associated
with the same structural transformation as for the bi-
molecular stage of reaction (10). Histidine imidazoles of
C-terminal sites and α-amides of N -terminal sites seem
to be the aminoacid residues, which are responsible for
this transformation [2,8,53]. Speciﬁcally, in the alkaline
Bohr eﬀect the interaction between the solvent and the
β146His residue (a C-terminal histidine of β-chain) is
one of the most probable reasons for the heme struc-
ture modiﬁcation and the rearrangement of neighboring
aminoacid residues [2]. Our simulation conﬁrms that the
variation in pH can result in essential structural trans-
formations in immediate proximity from the iron atom.
The strong pH-dependence for the times τreb and τs is a
consequence of the transformations.

The ligand penetration from the solvent into the heme
pocket is shown for O2 or N O in Hb [5] to be a process
restraining the rate of bimolecular recombination (10).
Therefore, the similarity between the pH-dependences
for τreb and τs testiﬁes that the change in pH has a
slight eﬀect on the oxygen migration in hemoglobin at
the mono- and bimolecular stages of recombination (10).
The weak pH-dependence for the obtained times of oxy-

5

 

gen escape from the pocket conﬁrms this assumption.
Such a pH-invariant behavior for the oxygen migration
can be interpreted by the independence of mobility for
the hemoglobin side chains (which seem to be responsi-
ble for the ligand transitions between cavities of heme
protein [38]) on pH of the solution.

B. Eﬃciency of oxygen escaping from hemoglobin

The obtained times τreb and τesc are used then in
order to estimate the eﬃciency of oxygen escape from
hemoglobin as a function of pH. The eﬃciency is pro-
portional to the quantum yield of photodissociation and
can be associated with the portion Ps of the hemes re-
maining in unbound state after realization of the gemi-
nate reoxygenation stage [54]. In our simulation the ra-
tio τreb/τesc falls within a range of values from 0.4 up
to 0.6. It implies that the portion Ps can be determined
from approximation(9). The behavior of pH-dependence
for the obtained quantity Ps agrees well with one for
the measured quantum yield of photodissociation [51,51].
The quantity Ps is shown in Fig. 4 to be proportional to
the apparent quantum yield γ for the whole investigated
scale of pH.

[50,51]) depending on pH values of the solution.

Notice that for the studied range of pH values the
quantity Csτreb/τesc is considerably low in comparison
with 1 (Csτreb/τesc ∼ 0.15 ÷ 0.25) and the time τesc is
practically constant. Therefore the relation of the por-
tion Ps with the time τreb is close to the linear law:

Ps =

Csτreb
(τesc + Csτreb)

τreb
τesc

≈ Cs

∝ τreb.

(11)

In our study (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) the pH-dependences
obtained for Ps and τreb are similar that testiﬁes again

that the transport properties for the oxygen molecule in
hemoglobin do not depend on pH.

C. Diﬀusion properties of oxygen migration in
hemoglobin

The analysis of X-ray diﬀraction data [55,56] for oxy-
genated and deoxygenated species of human hemoglobin
(PDB ID 1HHO and 2HHB, correspondingly) shows
that the cage radius ρ to be associated with the heme
pocket size is a quantity ranging from 1 up to 5 ˚A(taking
into account the Van der Waals radiuses). Hence,
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D for the oxygen migration in
hemoglobin can be estimated from relation (8): D =
ρ2/6τesc ∼ 0.2 ÷ 5 · 1011 m2/s. This coeﬃcient is in-
termediate to diﬀusion coeﬃcients for small molecules in
water ( 10−9 m2/s) and solids (10−18 m2/s at T < 400K)
[57]

According to the diﬀusion law, at a time instant tm the

IV. CONCLUSION

We have represented a simple model of the geminate
recombination of heme proteins with small ligands. The
model takes into account dynamic properties of ligand
displacement in protein matrix. In the model the recom-
bination is due both to the heme-ligand rebinding and
to the diﬀusion-like migration of ligand between protein
cavities. The temporal behavior for the probability P (t)
to ﬁnd the heme in unbound state is speciﬁed in terms of
two parameters. They are the time τreb of heme-ligand
rebinding for the ligand inside the heme pocket and the
time τesc of ligand escape from the pocket.

We have applied our model

in order to analyze a
postphotodissociative geminate reoxygenation of human
hemoglobin at various pH values of the solution. The
measured kinetic curves and the eﬃciency of oxygen es-
cape from the hemoglobin are well reproduced in our sim-
ulation. It testiﬁes that the non-exponential behavior for
the probability P (t) can be explained by a diﬀusion-like
migration of ligand over protein cavities. This conclu-
sion is consistent with recent kinetic measurements [58].
We believe that the theory-experiment agreement may be
considered as an additional validation for the glass-like
model of proteins.

Our study demonstrates also that the variation in pH
can result in considerable changes for the rate of heme-
ligand rebinding. At the time, the oxygen migration in
hemoglobin depends slightly on pH. We have interpreted
this eﬀect as a result of essential structural transforma-
tions in immediate proximity from the iron atom. Cer-
tainly, this conclusion demands a more detailed and thor-
ough examination. In any case we suppose that the pH-
induced modiﬁcation of the initial stage of GR (if the
modiﬁcations are observed) can be explained by a change
in the rate of heme-ligand rebinding.

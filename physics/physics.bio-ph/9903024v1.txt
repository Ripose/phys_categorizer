The idea of adaptive walks on ﬁtness landscapes as a means of studying evolutionary processes
on large time scales is extended to ﬁtness landscapes that are slowly changing over time. The
inﬂuence of ruggedness and of the amount of static ﬁtness contributions are investigated for model
landscapes derived from Kauﬀman’s N K landscapes. Depending on the amount of static ﬁtness
contributions in the landscape, the evolutionary dynamics can be divided into a percolating and

regions of the landscape with high ﬁtness.

Most work on Darwinian evolution so far has been
concerned with evolution in constant environments on
the one hand (e.g., see [1–3] for the ﬁeld of population
genetics, or [4] for adaptive walks), and coevolutionary
processes on the other hand (e.g., see [5,6] for ecological
models like Lotka-Volterra systems, or [7–9] for Artiﬁcial
Life type computer simulations). The case in which a
species is subjected to a changing environment, without
being able to inﬂuence it, has been studied only rarely.
Most work of the latter type is considering a single pe-
riodically changing optimum [10–13]. In such situations,
the evolutionary dynamics acts as a low pass ﬁlter [14].
The optimum can only be tracked if the oscillation fre-
quency is suﬃciently low.

In this work, we are considering evolution in high-
dimensional ﬂuctuating ﬁtness landscapes, with diﬀerent
amounts of dynamic and static ﬁtness contributions. The
motivation of this work comes from in vivo evolution of
proteins. Living organisms use a huge amount of diﬀer-
ent proteins. Where does this diversity originate from?
When looking at a single protein in a particular species,
the protein appears to be in a local optimum, without any
better mutants nearby. However, to account for the ob-
served diversity, there must be mechanisms that allow to
move on from one local optimum to another sporadically.
The simplest mechanism one can consider is one in which
large mutations sometimes carry a protein into a distant
region in the genotype space. Although this mechanism
cannot completely be rejected, it is unlikely that large
mutations play a predominant role in protein evolution.
A large mutation is essentially a random jump into the
genotype space, leading with extremely high probability
to an amino acid sequence that cannot fold correctly any-
more. Therefore, large mutations will in almost all cases
not produce a viable protein.

A mechanism that works with small mutations is drift
It has been mostly studied for
on neutral networks.
RNA [15–17], but it can also be considered in the case of
proteins [18]. On a neutral network, mutations change
the amino acid sequence, but leave the protein fold and,

more importantly, the protein’s active region unaltered.
From time to time, the drifting sequence comes close to
a sequence with higher ﬁtness, and then a transition to a
new local optimum takes place. This theory works well
for in vitro experiments [19], but it is unclear whether
enough neutrality exists in vivo to allow for suﬃcient
drift [20–22]. There exists evidence that in some cases,
no neutral amino acid substitutions exist in living or-
ganisms (e.g., for Drosophila m.’s alcohol dehydrogenase
locus [23]) and that the environment can select for ex-
tremely small ﬁtness diﬀerences [24,25]. The reason why
this cannot be observed in in vitro experiments is prob-
ably that the experiments are not sensitive enough [25].

Benner and Ellington [20] have suggested a diﬀerent
mechanism that could work with small mutations and
in the absence of neutrality. They propose that slow
environmental changes generate a constant genetic drift
which can be accounted for the protein diversity. This
idea has never been studied quantitatively in a mathe-
matical model.

Here, we are going to study a model which demon-
strates that indeed a slowly changing environment can
generate something like a constant genetic drift. We will
call this drift “environmentally guided drift”. It is not
a diﬀusion process, such as neutral drift [1]. The pop-
ulation as a whole moves through the genotype space,
since transitions to selectively advantageous states hap-
pen very fast, as ﬁrst order phase transitions [26,27].
Adaptive walks are particularly suitable to study such
phenomena, and we will use them throughout this paper,
neglecting population eﬀects or crossover of genotypes.

The statement that the population always remains lo-
cated in the genotype space, and that hence the dynamics
can be approximated with an adaptive walk, can only be
justiﬁed if the environmental changes are very slow. If
this is the case, i.e., if the ﬁtness landscape does change
only marginally over time intervals of the length of typ-
ical waiting times between two transitions, the adaptive
walk approximation should be valid under the same as-
sumptions as in static landscapes. Note that this means,

1

on the other hand, that in our model the adaptive walk
must be allowed to do a number of jumps prior to sig-
niﬁcant changes in the landscape. As a consequence, the
walker will often have the chance to reach a local opti-
mum before it starts out for a new peak because of the
deforming landscape. Later in this paper, we will discuss
the adiabatic limit, which is an even slower time scale. In
the adiabatic limit, the changes happen so slowly that for
every change in the ﬁtness landscape the adaptive walk
can always ﬁnd a local optimum.

As example landscapes, we choose Kauﬀman’s N K
landscapes [4,28], which are spin glass-like landscapes
commonly used for the study of adaptive walks. Al-
though they cannot be directly related to the true land-
scapes underlying in vivo protein evolution, their tunable
degree of ruggedness makes them a good tool to study
general eﬀects in rugged landscapes. In a N K landscape,
the ﬁtness of a bit string of length N is deﬁned as the
average over each bit’s ﬁtness contribution. The contri-
butions depend on the state of the corresponding bit as
well as on the state of K other bits interacting with it.
We can write the ﬁtness f as:

f =

fi({S}i) ,

(1)

1
N

N

X
i=1

where {S}i is the state of the K+1 bits inﬂuencing the ﬁt-
ness contribution of bit i. In Kauﬀman’s original formu-
lation, the functions fi({S}i) are realized as tables con-
taining a diﬀerent quenched random ﬁtness contribution
for every state {S}i. Here we are interested in a time-
dependent form of Eq. (1). One possibility has been pro-
posed by Levitan and Kauﬀman [29], who have studied
the case that the ﬁtness cannot be measured exactly. In
their work, the measured ﬁtness f ′ equals the true ﬁtness
f plus a noise term g(t). Such an approach has proven
suitable to study the eﬀects of noise in chemical engineer-
ing problems [30]. However, it does not work here, since
we are interested in local deformations of the landscape,
and not in a global noise-induced shift. What we do in-
stead is to use time-dependent functions fi({S}i, t). Note
the general diﬀerence in the model of Levitan and Kauﬀ-
man and of ours. In their model, the ﬁtness landscape
is static, but can only be measured with ﬁnite accuracy.
In our model, the ﬁtness landscape itself is changing, but
the ﬁtness can be measured exactly. Considering the long
time scale we are addressing, we can assume that noise
does not play a prominent role here. The single walker
represents the mean of a population, as noted above. In
the population mean, the noise is averaged out. We will
later discuss how the model could be altered for noise too
intense to allow that assumption, or for populations so
small that destabilizing eﬀects can occur.

We choose the functions fi({S}i, t) to be continuous
in time. Noisy, discontinuous ﬁtness contributions seem
to be unappropriate to model a slowly changing environ-

ment. In principle, one could of course add a noise term
on top of each ﬁtness contribution, or study landscapes
with mixed noisy and continuous contributions, but this
is not our objective here.

Not necessarily all ﬁtness contributions need to be
truly time dependent. Some may be equal to a constant,

fi({S}i, t) = Ci, {S}i .

(2)

It is useful to keep track of the amount of static contribu-
tions in the landscape. We denote the fraction of static
contributions by fS. Adaptive walks on time-dependent
N K landscapes show several distinct classes of behavior,
most strongly inﬂuenced by fS.

So far we have described the basis of our model, now
we have to specify the actual form of the ﬁtness contri-
butions. For data analysis, it is useful to impose periodic
boundary conditions on the ﬁtness landscape, i.e.,

f (t + T ) = f (t) ,

(3)

with oscillation period T . Throughout the rest of this
work, we will stick to this choice. Its advantage rests in
the easy comparison of a bit string’s evolution in diﬀer-
ent oscillation periods. In particular, it allows to use the
concept of environmentally linked networks introduced
below.

The form of the functions fi({S}i, t) can in principle
be arbitrarily complicated. We are going to consider a
simple trigonometric time dependency,

fi({S}i, t) =

[sin(ω{S}i t + δ{S}i) + 1] .

(4)

This introduces only a single additional constant per ﬁt-
ness contribution, if compared to the static landscape.
The frequencies ω{S}i and the phases δ{S}i are chosen
randomly when constructing the landscape, and are then
kept ﬁxed for all times t. The phases are distributed uni-
formly in the interval [0; 2π) so that the resulting ﬁtness
landscape is homogeneous in time. We set the frequen-
cies to ω{S}i = 2πn{S}i/T , with n{S}i being integral, and
T being arbitrary, but the same for all ω{S}i, to obtain
a periodic ﬁtness landscape with oscillation period T . If
we want a ﬁtness contribution to be constant, we set the
corresponding frequency ω{S}i to 0.

We have done a large number of simulations with dif-
ferent choices for N and K, with diﬀerent sets of oscil-
lation frequencies, and also with more complicated func-
tions fi({S}i, t), in which the oscillations have additional
random amplitudes and oﬀsets.
In all cases, the ba-
sic patterns are very similar. The parameters having
the strongest inﬂuence on the observed behavior are the
ruggedness K and the fraction of static ﬁtness contri-
butions fS. In Figs. 1-3, some typical runs of adaptive
walks in oscillating N K-landscapes are presented. In the
simulations leading to these plots, we used N = 20 and

2

K = 8. Additionally, we employed only a single oscilla-
tion mode. This means, all frequencies ω{S}i were either
set to zero or set to some ﬁxed value ω = 2π/T . The
oscillation period T was set to T = 1000, which can be
considered large in a system with N = 20. A local opti-
mum can typically be found in about 100 time steps in
a static N K landscape with such N . The adaptive walk
was performed exactly as in Kauﬀman’s original work: a
random point mutation was accepted if it increased the
bit string’s ﬁtness. Otherwise, the mutation was rejected.
Figure 1 shows an example of the evolutionary dynam-
ics with a relatively low fraction of static ﬁtness contri-
butions. The resulting pattern is a chaotically changing
ﬁtness. With almost every accepted mutation, a new
genotype is encountered. The environmental changes
constantly lead the walker into regions previously not
visited. This reminds one of a random walk. However,
there are some diﬀerences between the adaptive walk and
a random walk. We will discuss them below.

The behavior of the adaptive walk changes drastically
with increasing fS. The higher amount of static ﬁtness
contributions reduces the number of possible advanta-
geous mutations in every time step. The bits connected
to static contributions freeze out in a locally optimal
state, and only the sites connected to oscillating con-
tributions can still change. Hence, the dynamics gets
conﬁned in a small region of the genotype space. The
same mutational patterns are seen over and over again
in the diﬀerent oscillation periods. In the ﬁtness plots,
we can identify this behavior with a periodic or almost
periodic change of the ﬁtness, as shown in Fig. 2. Using
the language of dynamic systems, we can say that the
attractor of an adaptive walk on an oscillating landscape
with intermediate fS is a noisy limit cycle. With some
small probability p, the process can leave a limit cycle.
Several transitions between such metastable limit cycles
are shown in Fig. 3. The mean ﬁtness can increase or
decrease because of the transitions. The frequency with
which transitions occur depends on the actual value of
fS. The larger fS, the rarer can transitions be observed.
These metastable states remind one very much of
the metastability induced by ﬁnite populations on static
landscapes with a high degree of neutrality [31–33], how-
ever they are generated through a completely diﬀerent
mechanisms. A slight qualitative diﬀerence between the
two types of metastability is that here, the transitions
lead regularly to a decrease of a metastable state’s av-
erage ﬁtness, whereas in neutrality-induced transitions,
this is mostly not the case. Nevertheless, the work of
Nimwegen et al. shows that with very small populations,
the evolutionary dynamics on a landscape with neutral-
ity can as well display transitions leading to a decrease
of ﬁtness [32]. The interesting point of our ﬁndings here
is that we ﬁnd metastability under the complete absence
of neutrality.

Let us now address the question whether the transi-

tions actually lead to an increase in ﬁtness, or whether
advantageous and disadvantageous transitions balance
each other. In Fig. 4, we show the expected ﬁtness as
a function of time for 100 oscillations with a period of
T = 2560. The expected ﬁtness was obtained by averag-
ing over 50 independent runs. We have chosen fS = 0.6,
which is well in the metastable regime. We observe that
the most important ﬁtness gain is reached during the ﬁrst
couple of oscillations (the curve starts of from hf i = 0.5
for t = 0). Nonetheless, for the complete duration of
the 100 oscillations, we observe a constant slight increase
in the ﬁtness. A linear ﬁt to the expected ﬁtness from
time step 104 to the end of the recording gives an in-
crease in ﬁtness of 1.03 × 10−4 per oscillation period. Ul-
timately, for much longer simulation runs, the expected
ﬁtness reaches an asymptotic value. Note that the slight
ﬁtness increase over many oscillation periods is an ef-
fect peculiar to the metastable regime.
In the chaotic
regime the expected ﬁtness reaches its asymptotic value
very quickly, after a few oscillation periods.

The adaptive walk’s eﬃciency to ﬁnd regions of high
ﬁtness can be judged from the mean ﬁtness encountered
during the walk. Figure 5 shows the mean ﬁtness, aver-
aged over several independent adaptive walks, as a func-
tion of the oscillation period T . The curve correspond-
ing to the chaotic regime, with fS = 0, starts oﬀ at a
mean ﬁtness of 0.5 for small T . This is the average ﬁt-
ness on the landscape, and hence the walker approxi-
mately does a random walk on the landscape. For larger
T , the mean ﬁtness quickly grows and reaches a value
close to the average of a local optimum in the landscape.
Although the movement in the genotype space appears
to be chaotic, the expected ﬁtness of the walker at any
point in time is as large as the expected highest ﬁtness
an adaptive walk in a comparable static landscape would
encounter. Therefore, for large T the walker’s movement
can be considered as a random walk conﬁned to the re-
gions of high ﬁtness in the genotype space. When we
increase the amount of static contributions in the land-
scape, the average ﬁtness is above 0.5 even for very fast
environmental changes. For larger T , the average ﬁtness
increases towards the average height of local optima in
the landscape, and even signiﬁcantly above it. The lat-
ter occurs in time-dependent landscapes as long as only a
tiny amount of time-dependent contributions is present.
To understand why this happens, consider a bit string
in which all but one bit have only static contributions.
The remaining bit may also give a static contribution
if it is set to 0, and a time-dependent one if it is set
to 1. For the times when the time-dependent contribu-
tion is smaller than the static one, the bit will be set
to 0, and otherwise it will be set to 1. This eﬀectively
increases the average height of local optima in dynamic
landscapes. The eﬀect is most pronounced if the number
of static contributions is moderately large, for fS around
0.8.

At this point, it is interesting to ask what proportion of
the genotype space can actually be reached through envi-
ronmentally guided drift. The question can be addressed
with the concept of environmentally linked networks (EL
networks). We deﬁne an EL network to be the set of
all points in the genotype space the adaptive walk can
reach at times nT , n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., starting from a ﬁxed
position in the genotype space. We will say an EL net-
work percolates if it consists of inﬁnitely many points.
This deﬁnition is similar to the usual deﬁnition of the
percolating cluster on the Bethe lattice, and is the ap-
propriate way to deﬁne percolation in high-dimensional
spaces [34]. It can be applied literally only in the limit
N → ∞. However, the genotype space grows so fast with
increasing N that this restriction can be neglected.

If the walker is for small fS indeed doing a random
walk over the landscape, or over the landscape’s regions
of high ﬁtness, as we supposed above, then we should
ﬁnd a percolating EL network in the chaotic regime.

The study of EL networks in oscillating N K land-
scapes is computationally very demanding, since we have
to go through the full oscillation periods in the simula-
tion. Hence, we have to restrict ourselves to moderate

T and N .
ωi = ω = 2π/T with T = 1000, as well as N = 20.

Figure 6 shows the fraction γ of new genotypes among
all the genotypes encountered at the beginning of each
oscillation period. This is a measure for the size of an
EL network. A value near 1 means a new genotype has
been encountered in almost every oscillation period. On
the other hand, a value near 0 means the network’s size
is small, thus conﬁning the adaptive walk in a limited re-
gion of the genotype space. In the limit of inﬁnitely many
oscillation periods, only percolating networks can have a
positive γ, whereas ﬁnite networks yield γ = 0. There-
fore, γ is a proper order parameter indicating a perco-
lation transition. Clearly, in numerical experiments the
number of oscillation periods over which the measure-
ment is taken is ﬁnite, and therefore we will observe a

case of Fig. 6, the value γ was obtained from averag-
ing over 60 adaptive walks, each on a diﬀerent ﬁtness
landscape. Every adaptive walk endured 200 oscillation
periods. The error bars present the standard deviations
of the single measurements.

Let us begin the discussion of Fig. 6 with the graph on
the right, for K = 8. We ﬁnd a γ close to 1 for small fS,
and a vanishing γ for fS ≈ 1. The standard deviations

about fS ≈ 0.5, a sharp drop in γ can be observed, ac-
companied with an enormous increase in the error bars.
This is good evidence for the existence of a percolation
transition with critical point f ∗
S around 0.5. The large
error bars are a sign for critical ﬂuctuations, observed in
2nd order phase transitions. The graph on the left of
Fig. 6, for K = 2, shows a very diﬀerent behavior. The

quantity γ does not reach higher than about 0.2, and
the error bars are large for the whole range of fS. We
do not see a clear percolation transition for this much
less rugged landscape. The large error bars indicate that
the ﬁnite γ for small fS is rather an artifact due to the
ﬁnite sampling than a true result. We have done compa-
rable simulations for the range of K from 0 up to 14, and
what we generally observe is that the transition becomes
sharper with increasing K.

We can understand the above observation in the adi-
abatic limit. For the case of a Fujiyama landscape
(K = 0), the EL network degenerates to a single point
in this limit, and percolation can consequently not be
observed. On the other hand, the completely random
landscape we obtain for K = N − 1 presents a multitude
of local optima, and the changes in the landscape pro-
vide the opportunity to hop from one local optimum to
another in a random fashion during the oscillation pe-
riods. The landscapes with intermediate K interpolate
between the two extremes. This argument shows that
ruggedness must generally promote the movement in the
genotype space for the low-fS regime, a situation com-
pletely opposite to the case of static landscapes, where
ruggedness is regarded as an impediment to the move-
ment in the genotype space. If the changes happen on a
slow enough time scale, the increased mobility does not
lead to an error catastrophe through which all informa-
tion is lost, such as the breakdown of the quasispecies for
large mutation rates [35]. As we saw in Fig. 5, the ﬁtness
is constantly in the region of average local optima. We
observe this also in the example run displayed in Fig. 1.
The ﬁtness is chaotically changing, but it is always well
above the landscape mean of 0.5. An error catastrophe
occurs only if the environmental changes happen very fast
compared to the typical adaptation time of the system.
So far, we disregarded noise or loss of information be-
cause of very small populations in our model. Both have
the eﬀect to enable the acceptance of mutations leading
to lower ﬁtness. Here, we could incorporate them by
adding noise to the ﬁtness as in [29], or by accepting bad
mutations with some probability. As long as these mech-
anisms do not lead to an error catastrophe on a static
landscape, they should not very much alter the dynam-
ics on a slowly changing landscape from what we have
found here.

Evolution in a slowly changing environment follows a
dynamics very diﬀerent from the situation in a ﬁxed envi-
ronment. The environmentally guided drift drives genes
out of local optima, and drags them around in the geno-
type space. We have presented evidence for the existence
of a giant EL network for fS below some critical f ∗
S in
landscapes with suﬃcient ruggedness. Consequently, in
this regime the whole genotype space can be transversed
by means of environmentally guided drift. The guided
drift can provide – in absence of any neutral pathways in
the ﬁtness landscape – an eﬃcient mechanism to generate

4

constantly new genotypes, albeit at every single point in
time the system seems to be trapped in a local optimum.
We could show that the eﬃciency of the environmentally
guided drift is related to the ruggedness of the landscape.
A more rugged landscape provides more opportunities to
move around under environmental changes than a land-
scape with only a few peaks. Consequently, the rugged
landscapes observed in protein evolution [20] can pro-
mote protein evolution in an ever changing environment,
instead of hindering it. If we have a population that de-
composes into several subpopulations not coupled with
each other through selection, these subpopulations will
disperse and move to completely diﬀerent regions of the
genotype space because of environmentally guided drift,
even if the process starts oﬀ from a completely homoge-
neous population and if all individuals in the system feel
the same environmental changes at the same time. The
decoupling of the subpopulations can occur, for exam-
ple, if the population lives in a very large geographical
territory, so that individuals living in one part do not di-
rectly interact with individuals living in another part, or
if a physical barrier forms at one point in time that di-
vides the territory into several independent regions. As
a consequence, rugged landscapes combined with slow
environmental changes should inevitably lead to a large
variety of diﬀerent evolutionary solutions for the same
problems.

Although the EL networks used here for data analysis
are only meaningful in periodic landscapes, the conclu-
sions drawn from their study should also hold in non-
periodic situations. The reason why environmentally
guided drift becomes so eﬃcient for small fS is that con-
stantly new local optima appear nearby. Therfore, if the
changes are non-periodic, but the landscape has suﬃcient
ruggedness, the adaptive walk should similarly behave
like a random walk over the landscape’s regions of high
ﬁtness.

An eﬀect tightly connected to the periodicity of the
landscape, on the other hand, is the appearance of limit
cycles. The dynamics in oscillating N K landscapes is
above the percolation transition dominated by noisy limit
cycles, with sporadically occuring transitions from one
limit cycle to another. The system goes through several
noisy limit cycles until a stable limit cycle, or a stable
ﬁxed point, is reached. This eﬀect reminds one of the
behavior of evolution on landscapes with a high degree
of neutrality. There, evolution proceeds on neutral net-
works, with sporadic transitions between them, until a
stable local optimum is reached.

The model studied in the present paper, i.e., an adap-
tive walk on an oscillating N K-landscape, is certainly too
simplistic to be accounted for as a realistic model of the in
vivo evolution of proteins in a changing environment. In
particular, it can be argued whether sinusoidally chang-
ing ﬁtness contributions are justiﬁed. Nevertheless, such
simple models often capture the qualitative properties of

more realistic situations. Similar percolation transitions
can probably be found also in other time-dependent land-
scapes with suﬃcient ruggedness.

In future work, it should be interesting to study the
percolation transition in more detail, and to determine
for what K a percolating regime actually exists. Further-
more, the interplay between static and dynamic ﬁtness
contributions should also be investigated in other ﬁtness
landscapes.

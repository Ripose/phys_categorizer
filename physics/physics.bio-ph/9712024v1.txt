extinction

A simple mathematical homogeneous model of competition is used to de-

scribe Neanderthal extinction in Europe. It considers two interacting species,
Neanderthals and Early Modern Men, in the same ecological niche. Using

paleontological data we claim that the parameter of similarity, between both
species, ﬂuctuates between 0.992 and 0.997. An extension of the model in-

cluding migration (diﬀusion) is also discussed nevertheless, extinction of Ne-
anderthal seems unavoidable. Numerical analysis of travelling wave solutions
(fronts) conﬁrms the extinction. The wave-front-velocity is estimated from

linear analysis and numerical simulations conﬁrm this estimation. We con-
jecture a mathematical formulation for the principle of exclusion between

competitive interacting species (Gause).

Mathematical models for interaction and coexistence between species,
yield non-linear equations which contain a number of rate constants. These

constants are usually determined empirically in controlled experiments, or
by observations in natural environments [1-5].

In this work we consider a system with competitive exclusion. We study
the competition between Neanderthals and men with early modern structure.
So, explicitly, we assume that Neanderthals did not evolve into Early Modern

Men.

Neanderthals were very stable in Europe for more than 60.000 years nev-

ertheless, 40.000 years before our epoch, they were replaced by Early Modern
Men. This massive extinction was completed between 5.000 and 10.000 years
depending on the region. It is not clear how modern men appear in Europe,

but some evidence of coexistence in the Levant (see for instance [6] and [7]),
suggests a diﬀusive process from that region. Moreover, whether the interac-

tion was direct (war) or not (competition) remains unclear nevertheless, we
assume the last possibility. So, we have two species competing for the same

ecological niche composed of limited nutrient and territory. The principle of
exclusion (Gause) [5,8] can be applied and then both species cannot coexist.

The following simpliﬁed non-linear mathematical model could describe

this biological interaction. Let N be the number of individual, at time t,
with Neanderthal characters, and C the one related to Early Modern Men.

In this way, we assume the same rate of birth F (N, C) for both species, and

a tiny diﬀerence in the constant rate of mortality β. Namely, we assume
1, where s = 1
that the parameter of similarity s varies between 0 < s
means complete similarity. Thus, species C is better adapted to survive. The

≤

limited nutrient reservoir and territory is modeled by the dependence of F
on the variables N and C (see for instance[1]) :

F = α

where the growth rate α and the interaction parameter δ are positive num-

bers, and we assume α > β > 0.

Equations (1-3) deﬁne a Malthusian-birth-death process with interaction,

and obviously is a crude model. For instance, it does not consider the dif-
fusion process due to the alleged migration of modern hominid. Moreover,
one might expect the rate constant α, β and δ to be aﬀected by changes of

ecological nature (temperature, humidity, random ﬂuctuations, amount of

with systems subjected to random environment [2,3] where, sometimes, the
impact may be drastic (noise-induced transition). However, equations (1-

3) are in accord with the principle of exclusion. Predictions related to the
degree of similarity s, between both species, will be conjectured.

node. All this in accord with Gause’s principle (ﬁgure 1). Moreover, a direct

where A0 is a constant of integration. As long as 0 < s < 1 (already assumed)
the species N disappear, and the time of extinction τ can be related to the

parameters by

compare this result, for instance, with the parameter of similarity between
man and chimpanzee [9] where s′

the sequence of nucleotides in DNA, and then not necessarily connected to
s. On the other hand, following Reef.[10], Neanderthal industry (silex-knife)

did require about 111 percussions (4 stages) against 251 (9 stages) for Cro-
Magnon. So the comparison of the number of percussion (for stage) gives
s′′ = 111

0.995. A number curiously close of our parameter s.

Turning to the two species model (1-3), a more realistic case requires
migration. This can be carried-up by adding a diﬀusive term onto (2), and

neglecting the mobility of N in a ﬁrst approach. In a more quantitative form,
for instance, consider a migration term like to this one considered originally

by Volterra [1,2], i.e. adding up a positive constant m onto (2) :

Nevertheless, a modiﬁcation on the time of extinction τ (5) is expected in this
case. So, a constant migration term does not stop Neanderthal extinction.

Finally, the deterministic model (1-3) with interaction is simple and sim-
ilar to those proposed in [1]. Nevertheless, as long as we assume the validity

of the exclusion principle (Gause), other deterministic models [2-4] cannot
gives us very diﬀerent results. Namely, the exclusion principle guaranties the
extinction of species N. In fact, from equations (1-3) we have the inequality

which tell us that no-equilibrium points exist like to (N0, C0), where N0 6

and C0 6

of equilibrium points like to (N0, 0). In this way, the above inequality can
be interpreted as a mathematical formulation of the exclusion principle, and
then we can expect its validity for other deterministic models describing the

(10)

interaction between N and C.

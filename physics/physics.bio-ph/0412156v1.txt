Abstract

We study the interaction of lipid bilayers with short chain alcohols
using molecular dynamics on diﬀerent length scales. We use detailed
atomistic modeling and modeling on the length scale where an alcohol is
just an amphiphilic dimer. Our strategy is to calibrate a coarse–grained
model against the detailed model at selected state points at low alcohol
concentration and then perform a wider range of simulations using the
coarse–grained model. We get semiquantitative agreement with exper-
iment for the major observables such as order parameter and area per
molecule. We ﬁnd a linear increase of area per molecule with alcohol
concentration. The alcohol molecules in both system descriptions are in
close contact with the glycerol backbone. Butanol molecules can enter the
bilayer to some extent in contrast to the behavior of shorter alcohols. At
very high alcohol concentrations we ﬁnd clearly increased interdigitation
between leaﬂets.

1 Introduction

Phospholipid bilayers serve an important role in all living cells since they con-
stitute the bulk of cellular and intracellular membranes. Therefore, it is not sur-
prising that there is signiﬁcant attention and research devoted to the exploration
of phospholipid behavior. Computer simulations play an ever increasing role in
this ﬁeld. Detailed computer simulations of phospholipid monolayers and bilay-
ers have recently achieved a high degree of sophistication [1–10]. The interac-
tions between lipid bilayers and water have been thoroughly examined and these
investigations have resulted in reﬁned bilayer structural models [5,7,11,12]. Mix-
tures of various phospholipids [12–15] as well as of phospholipids and cholesterol

systems [16–19] have been recently characterized. However, the interactions be-
tween lipid bilayer membranes and small molecules have not gained much at-
tention except for a few initial studies with alcohols [20–22], sugars [23,24], and
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) [25, 26].

Since cell membranes are the ﬁrst part of the cell to contact with any nutri-
ent or pathogen in the extracellular matrix, it is extremely important to fully
understand membrane interactions with biologically relevant small molecules.

It has been experimentally observed that alcohols have a destabilizing eﬀect
on model membranes [27, 28] by causing an increase in area per molecule and a
decrease in bilayer thickness. This alcohol induced change in bilayer structure
is directly related to the industrial problem of stuck fermentation in the wine
industry [29, 30]. A stuck fermentation occurs when yeast cells do not trans-
form all available sugar into alcohol. It has been proposed that the underlying
mechanism of this problem is an alcohol–triggered structural transition in the
membrane. This results in a conformational change in trans–membrane proteins
and causes the proteins to become dysfunctional [29]. To date, there is no avail-
able method for predicting a stuck fermentation. By examining the inﬂuence of
alcohols, such as butanol, on lipid bilayers, we will be able to study the primary
mechanisms that cause stuck fermentations, as protein conformational changes
are predicted to be a secondary eﬀect.

To determine how the entire bilayer area is aﬀected by interactions with n–
butanol molecules, a multiscale approach is used. Coarse–grained simulations
can be used to study large scale ﬂuctuations and membrane curvature (on the
order of tens of nanometers). Detailed atomistic simulations on the scale of a
few angstroms are appropriate for studying interactions between neighboring
atoms. Surprisingly, biomembrane multiscale models are not as abundant as
polymer multiscale models. There have been a few proposed coarse–grained
models [31–40] and they have the advantage of being economical in computer
power because a number of atoms or even whole molecules are combined into
ﬁctitious units and are assigned an interaction potential. This potential is often
designed to be computationally eﬃcient rather than an accurate system repre-
sentation. However, generic chemical eﬀects such as hydrophilic–hydrophobic
interactions [34], or the anisotropy of the overall molecule [33] are usually in-
cluded in the potential. Even though the atomistic detail is missing, interesting
generic properties of membranes have been elucidated with these models. One
example is the general pathway of self–assembly, which is not speciﬁc to the
individual lipid [33–35].

The purpose of this contribution is to study the eﬀects of low molecular
weight alcohols, such as n–butanol, by combining a fully atomistic model with
a recently proposed coarse–grained model [40, 41].

2 Simulation Techniques

We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between
phospholipid bilayers and n–butanol at varying alcohol concentrations. Both

2

an atomistic–scale and coarse–grained model were used. All simulations were
performed at 325 K and atmospheric pressure (1 atm). The simulated mem-
branes consisted of fully hydrated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bi-
layers with 128 molecules, i.e., 64 per leaﬂet. DPPC was chosen because it is one
of the most abundant phospholipids in animal cell membranes. We performed
our simulations for both scales using the GROMACS simulation suite [42].

2.1 Atomistic Modeling

Our detailed simulations are fully atomistic with an exception for hydrogen
atoms that are bonded in methyl(ene) groups both in butanol as well as in
the lipid tails. These hydrogens together with the respective carbon are col-
lapsed into one united atom description. Simulations of the pure bilayer, as
well as bilayers with up to 5 wt% n–butanol, (lipid free basis, as we do not take
the lipids into account for concentration calculations) have been performed.
Simulations were performed under constant temperature and constant pressure
conditions using the Berendsen weak–coupling scheme [43]. The coupling times
were τp = 1.0 ps and τT = 0.2 ps for pressure and temperature respectively and
a compressibility of 1.12 × 10−6 atm−1. The simulations with a time–step of 2 fs
lasted up to 10 ns. We used a cutoﬀ of the Lennard–Jones interaction of 1.0 nm.
The lipid simulation models were designed by Berger et al. [44]. Additionally, we
use the Gromos model for alcohols [42] combined with the SPC/E model [45] for
water. Electrostatic interactions have been considered using the particle mesh
Ewald technique [46]. The initial system conﬁgurations were taken from earlier
studies on shorter alcohols [47] where the ethanol was replaced by n–butanol.

2.2 Coarse–Grained Modeling

For the coarse–grained simulations our water and lipid interaction potential pa-
rameters come from a model proposed by Marrink et al [40] [40]. The initial
system conﬁgurations were deduced from an earlier study on pure DPPC [40]1.
The model was originally parameterized to reproduce the structural, dynamic,
and elastic properties of both lamellar and non–lamellar phospholipid states.
Groups of 4–6 heavy atoms are combined into coarse–grained interaction sites
and are classiﬁed according to their hydrophobicity. The lipid headgroup con-
sists of four sites. There are two hydrophilic sites: one representing the choline
and one representing the phosphate group, and two intermediately hydrophilic
sites capable of hydrogen bonding representing the glycerols. Each of the two
DPPC tails is modeled by four hydrophobic sites. Water is represented by hy-
drophilic interaction sites, where each site represents four real water molecules.
All sites interact in a pairwise manner via a Lennard–Jones (LJ) potential. Five
diﬀerent LJ potentials are used and range from weak for hydrophobic interac-
tions to strong for hydrophilic interactions.

In addition to the LJ interactions, a screened Coulomb interaction is used to
model the electrostatic interaction between the zwitterionic headgroups. The
choline group bears a charge of +1, and the phosphate group bears a charge
of −1. Soft springs between bonded pairs keep the molecules intact. Angle
potentials provide the appropriate chain stiﬀness and correct conformation. For
eﬃciency reasons all CG atoms have the same mass of 72 atomic units in the
simulation.

For our studies, we had to devise a model for the alcohol as it was not deﬁned
in the original force–ﬁeld. We use the strategy explained in the manual [48].
Thus, our alcohols are modeled as a dimer of a hydrophilic site and a hydropho-
bic site. The hydrophilic site interacts like the water molecules, the hydrophobic
site is the same as the alkanes in the lipids. We performed additional simula-
tions where the hydrophilic site was exchanged against an interaction like the
one of the glycerols, this did not change the conclusions signiﬁcantly. We are
aware that this model makes the alcohol a symmetric amphiphile which is not
fully realistic. As the interaction centers in the lipid tails stand for four carbons
we use this coarse–grained alcohol as n–butanol and refer to it that way in the
remainder of the article. Note, that we did not do any re–optimization of any
parameter. We experimented with slightly diﬀerent parameterizations but these
were not as successful. This may be attempted in subsequent work but here we
want to check the quality of the proposed model.

All simulations are set up in the bilayer state and we do not observe any
tendency of instability of the bilayer on the timescale of the simulations which
lasted for up to 2.4µs. Note, that this is an eﬀective time. A scaling factor of
four was previously found to reproduce both lipid lateral diﬀusion rates and the
self–diﬀusion of water for the CG model [40]. The times reported in this paper
will therefore be eﬀective times which are physically meaningful. For example
we use a time–step of 40 fs which is considered to represent 160 fs.

The box dimensions are again coupled semi–isotropically to a pressure bath
of 1 atm [43]. The temperature of the system is controlled using a weak coupling
scheme [43] with coupling times τp = 1 ps, τT = 10 ps, measured in the rescaled
time scale. The compressibility was set to 5 × 10−6 atm−1. The cutoﬀ for
Lennard–Jones interactions as well as the electrostatics was RC = 1.2nm.

The water rescaling is also visible in the alcohol concentrations. Since one
CG water represents four water molecules whereas one CG butanol represents
one real n–butanol, so that a simulated concentration of 1:100 (butanol : CG
water) actually represents 1:400. This renormalization was taken in consistency
with the water diﬀusion, no further change of parameters was applied. Table 1
summarizes all simulations considered in this work and Figure 1 shows snapshots
of an atomistic and a coarse–grained simulation in comparison.

3 Results and Discussion

The most important use of a coarse–grained model is that signiﬁcantly longer
time scales can be achieved with this model than if an atomistic model were

atomistic detail and CG represents coarse–grained simulations. Note that in
the case of coarse–grained simulations the number of coarse grained waters
corresponds to 4 times as many real water molecules and is considered corre-
spondingly in the concentrations

simulation time (2.4µs eﬀective time) took 40 hours on a AMD Athlon. On
the same computer system the atomistic simulations take about 1.5 days for a
nanosecond so the speedup is around three orders of magnitude. However, it
is important that the coarse–grained model appropriately represents the under-
lying system. To this end we are comparing a number of important variables.
The area per molecule is one of the easiest experimental observables for such
a system. It has been measured for n–butanol and other low molecular weight
alcohols [27, 28]. The experimental system is not exactly the same as our simu-
lations as it was a SOPC bilayer at T=298 K. SOPC is unlike DPPC not fully
saturated and both tails are 4 carbons longer, such that quantitative compar-
isons cannot be made. In the simulations we measure the area per molecule as
the area of the system in the xy–plane – the z direction is the bilayer normal –
divided by the number of lipids per leaﬂet (here 64).

Figure 2 shows the dependence of the area per molecule on alcohol con-
centration, we also show data from the experiments of Ly et al. [28] in that
ﬁgure. We obtain good agreement between all three data sets. Both simulation
models as well as the experimental data exhibit a linear increase of the area
per molecule with alcohol concentration. The agreement between the atomistic
and the coarse–grained simulations is satisfactory. Only the coarse–grained
simulations allow us to access to high alcohol concentrations due to the steep
increase in equilibration times. The agreement between experiments and the
coarse–grained model is reasonable considering the diﬀerence in systems. Re-
optimization of the alcohol parameters both of the atomistic as well as the
coarse–grained model will be made in order to reproduce experiments more ex-
actly. The lipid parameters on the other hand are very appropriate for our
studies. If we compare to experiments on pure DPPC in the bilayer state we
are in very good agreement with the typical value of 63˚A2 [49]. From our data
we obtain an area expansion coeﬃcient by linear regression of κ = 14 nm2 for
the coarse–grained model in comparison to κ = 8 nm2 for the experiments. As
we are only able to equilibrate low alcohol concentrations in the atomistic model
we refrain from estimating this coeﬃcient for the detailed model. This number
measures the extrapolated diﬀerence between a bilayer in pure water against
one in pure alcohol. This semiquantitative agreement between experiments and
the coarse–grained model is in line with the recent conclusions that the same
model can reproduce the phase coexistence in a mixed bilayer but the phase
transition temperature is underestimated [41].

It is also of interest to determine where the butanol molecules are preferen-
tially located within our system. This is deduced through density proﬁles which
show a clear separation in a bilayer and a water phase. The headgroup are has
the highest density and the center plane of the bilayer, which is its symmetry
plane, is the plane of lowest density. This proﬁle agrees very well with ear-
lier atomistic and coarse–grained simulations [2, 40]. The butanol molecules are
mainly located at the interface.This has previously been reported for ethanol
and methanol [20, 22]. It is interesting to note that the butanol concentration
in the bilayer interior is not zero. Atomistic detailed simulations of shorter

the atomistic and the coarse–grained model with experiments. Lines are meant
as guide to the eye only. Note, that in the coarse grained simulations the
concentrations are not the direct concentrations but renormalized according to
the meaning of the water molecules (see text for details). The experimental
data from ref. [28] are measured using another lipid (SOPC instead of DPPC).
We estimate the errors in the atomistic simulations to be about 5% and in the
coarse grained case to be about 2%.

alcohols have shown that methanol does not exist in the bilayer [22] and that
ethanol was able to cross the bilayer but could not reside in it [22]. Generally,
the probability of bilayer penetration increases with alcohol chain length due to
the increasing hydrophobicity.

Comparing the coarse–grained with the atomistic model reveals some diﬀer-
ences. First, it is clear that the atomistic density proﬁle exhibits more details
than can be represented in a coarse–grained model.

However, a more important diﬀerence between the models can be seen in
the concentration of butanol in the water phase. The coarse–grained model
overestimates the aﬃnity of alcohols to the phase boundary. In contrast to the
atomistic simulations the butanol concentration in the coarse–grained model
vanishes almost in the water. Currently, the length of the atomistic simulation
is too short to fully determine the extent of butanol penetration in the bilayer.
In general, the coarse grained model can be used to make a basic sketch of the
overall system features. However, future reﬁnement is desirable. Figure 4 allows
a more detailed investigation of the butanol position as we resolve the positions
of the various sub-groups of the phospholipids along the bilayer normal. We see
in both models that butanol stays in close contact to the lipid glycerol moiety.
This is in agreement with earlier studies on shorter alcohols showing a strong
hydrogen bonding of the alcohols to the oxygens in the glycerol [20, 22]. In the
atomistic model we actually ﬁnd the alcohol residing between the glycerol and
the alkane tails whereas in our coarse–grained model the butanol and glycerol

layer coincide. Another important structural quantity where we obtain excellent
agreement is the overall bilayer thickness. We use the distance between the
phosphorus (or phosphate) planes as an indicator of thickness which leads to
3.96 nm in the atomistic case and 4.06 nm for the larger scale model. The latter
number actually does not change at all if we use a butanol model where we
exchange the water–like interaction of the OH group with an interaction site
like the glycerols in the lipid.

If we compare the two concentrations of the coarse–grained model shown
in Figure 3 we see that at the higher concentration the bilayer conﬁguration
becomes distorted at the interface. This occurs because the native interface
cannot accommodate all alcohols. Additionally, the plane of lowest density is
not as pronounced as it is with the lower concentration. This corresponds to
experimental and simulational suggestions of increasing interdigitation between
layers with alcohol concentration [39, 50, 51]. In order to quantify interdigita-
tion we measured the density proﬁles of the alkane chains for the two leaﬂets
separately. Figure 5 shows this data for three selected concentrations. At low
concentrations there is no appreciable diﬀerence to the small interdigitation ex-
isting already in the pure bilayer. However, if we increase the concentration
to about 2% mol of n–butanol we see clearly increased interdigitation. This
indicates that that low butanol concentration has little impact on lipid struc-
ture. However, as the concentration increases the bilayer structure is massively
changed but not abandoned.

The bilayer structure is often characterized using the deuterium order pa-

rameter which is deﬁned as

where ˆez is a unit vector in the laboratory z–direction and ˆeα is a unit vector
in the local coordinate system of the tails. The order parameter calculation is
based on three connected carbons (or coarse–grained interaction sites) Ci−1,Ci,
and Ci+1 and ~e = ~ri+1 − ~ri−1. Figure 6 shows this order parameter. Since the
coarse–grained chains are composed of four interaction centers, only two order
parameters per chain can be deﬁned. We see a slight diﬀerence in the order
between the sn − 1 and sn − 2 chains where the sn − 1 chain is the alkane tail
directly connected to the headgroup and sn−2 is separated from the head group
by the glycerol backbone.

With increasing concentration the order parameter decreases signiﬁcantly at
all positions along the chains. This is shown in the left–hand panel of Figure 6.
The eﬀect is independent of the distance from the headgroup and the identity
of the chain (sn − 1 or sn − 2) as all the 4 curves in Figure 6 are parallel. This
indicates that the alcohol not only inﬂuences the headgroup and its immediate
vicinity but the whole layer. It is interesting to note that the coarse–grained
model can distinguish between the two chains of the lipid, it actually overesti-
mates the diﬀerence. The sn − 1 chain is more highly ordered in all cases. In
order to directly compare the data between atomistic and coarse grained we as-
sume that the four interaction sites in the lipid tails represent the four quarters
of the DPPC tail not taking the glycerols into account. This means we take the
middle atom of the second and third quarter of the atomistic tails (C7 and C11)
to compare, these are shown as symbols in the left hand panel of ﬁgure 6. We
see that for both atoms we get satisfactory agreement. Due to the intrinsic av-
eraging of the coarse–grained model the diﬀerence between the models is about
10%. We could obtain better agreement if we used other atomistic carbons to

4 Conclusion

In this study, we examined the eﬀects of alcohol concentration on a lipid bilayer
and showed that a coarse–grained model enables a wider range of parameters
to be surveyed than is possible using only atomistic models. The accuracy of
the coarse-grained model was examined by comparing experimentally important
quantities with atomistic simulations and experimental data in a relatively short
amount of computer time. This comparison indicated which coarse-grained
parameters need to be reﬁned.

The two models that we are comparing represent fundamentally the same
system and the combination of the two can be used to investigate various bilayer
properties. However, there are clear diﬀerences and a coarse–grained model
should only be used with caution and in conjunction with an atomistic model
as a basis. In this study we mainly see that the alcohol aﬃnity to the actual
interface is overestimated in the coarse–grained model. Nonetheless, most of
the relevant properties are very well in agreement between the two models. We
will continue evaluating bilayer properties for both models. From these studies,
we will be able to identify important parameters that should be incorporated
into future coarse-grained models. For the results here the exact coarse grained
interactions were not very important as we performed additional simulations
with slightly changed parameters and obtained the same conclusions.

We showed that increasing alcohol concentration leads to a linear increase

11

of the area per molecule and to a linear decrease in the chain order parameter.
The alcohols are modeled as amphiphilic molecules and tend to reside at the
interface, i.e. between the headgroup and the tails. Butanols are more likely
to enter the tail region shorter alcohols. At high butanol concentrations, the
interface can become saturated and cause butanol molecules to return to the
water phase. Lipid conformational changes increase with alcohol concentration
and this corresponds to an increase in leaﬂet interdigitation.

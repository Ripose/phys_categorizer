Abstract

Survival in groups of termites is known to be socially facilitated

since individual longevity is increased together with the size of the

group. Here we report on experimental evidence that survival as a

function of group size in C ornitermes cumulans (Kollar) does not in-

crease asysmptotically but it peaks in a group size range at which

individual longevity is maximal. Strinkly, this same eﬀect in other

social insects was noted more than ﬁfty years ago, but it was regarded

as “aberrant” since it has been generally assumed that individual sur-

vival should increase with the size of the group. We also provide

evidence that individual activity –measured as mobility– is maximal

at approximately the same group-size range as the observed survival.

1 Introduction

Grass´e and Chauvin (1944) reported a number of experiments to check the

eﬀects of group size on the survival of Apis sp., Polistes sp, Leptotorax

sp., Formica sp.

(Insecta: Hymenoptera) and Reticulitermes sp.(Insecta:

Isoptera). In all of them, but in Polistes, survival increased with increasing

group size. In Polistes they reported an “aberrant” result in which survival

in both large and small groups was smaller than in the middle ones. The

authors atributed these obeservations to bad experimental procedures or to

a very particular physiological trait of the species. The experiment was hence

repeated several times –even by independent observers– but the “aberrant”

result was always found. On a survey experiment performed on the sum-

mer 1994, we test grouped individuals of Syntermes sp., Nasutitermes sp.,

and Cornitermes sp.

(Insecta, Isoptera). Preliminary results showed the

same unexpected behaviour on the survival of grouped Cornitermes cumu-

lans (Kollar).

Such a convergence of results allow us to suspect that Grass´e & Chauvin

(1944) have in fact unwarrantly spotted a pattern that is biologically sound.

We base our suspicion on previous experimental works which show that (i)

individual survivorship of termites, while aﬀected by group size, may be re-

lated to individual mobility of group components (Miramontes and DeSouza,

1996), and (ii) longevity of individual termites seems to obey a hump-shaped

curve, clearly dependent on some (yet) unknown attribute of group size

(DeSouza et al., 2001).

In addition, there is theoretical evidence that co-

operation could either stabilize or destabilize the dynamics of a social group,

3

leading to maximal individual ﬁtness at intermediate colony sizes (Avil´es,

1999).

This paper aims to present experimental evidence linking individual mo-

bility, survivorship, and group size in termites. To achieve this we show that

both individual mobility and survival are humped functions peaking at sim-

iliar group-size range. We argue, on experimental and theoretical grounds,

that survival of starving grouped termite workers –at least in Cornitermes

sp– obeys a humped-shape curve which present a biologically sound, not

fortuitous, relationship to individual mobility.

2 Material & Methods

To conﬁrm the trend observed in survey experiments, two further experi-

ments were performed in 1996 and 1997 with grouped termites of this species

collected from wild colonies in Vi¸cosa in the state of Minas Gerais, South-

eastern Brazil. The ﬁrst experiment, spanning several days, was designed to

measure longevity while the second was intended to measure individual ac-

tivity. Both experiments involved termite workers (third instar and beyond)

of diﬀerent group sizes.

In the longevity experiment, termites from a wild colony were randomly

placed in groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (each group replicated eight

times). Collection took place in 04 April 1996. The groups were conﬁned in

test tubes made of transparent glass (9.5 × 1.4cm) with hermetically sealing

rubber caps. Each test tube is a ‘replicate’. Test tubes have been previously

washed and rinsed, soaked in sodium hypochlorin for 24h, rinsed again, and

4

sterilised at 180 ◦C for one hour. Tubes with termites were kept horizon-

tally, separated by plastic foam to prevent stridulation or other mechanically

transmitted signals to propagate between the tubes. The workers were incu-

bated in the dark at a constant temperature chamber (25 ◦C ± 0.5) and were

allowed to acclimatise for 12h. No food or water was provided, but tubes

were opened each 24h, to allow air exchange. Tubes were exposed to light

during the counting of survivors only (no more than 5 min). Observations

were made each eight hours intervals, until all individuals were dead (153h;

20 observations). Termite groups in which dead individuals presented any

sign of cannibalism were excluded from data analysis.

In the activity experiment, termites from another wild colony were ran-

domly placed in groups of 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 20, and 30 individuals (each group

replicated four times). Collection took place in 12 October 1997. The exper-

iment was setup as above, using a controlled temperature room (24 ◦C ± 0.5)

rather than a chamber. Termites were allowed to acclimatise in such a room,

for three hours before the observations began. Two observers took notes

of the number of termites moving in each group, at ﬁve minutes intervals,

during ten continuous hours. Each observer managed two replicates of the

experiment (two tubes of each group size). Light intensity in the room was

the lowest possible to allow the work of the observers.

Statistical analyses aimed to check whether group size would aﬀect (i)

survival and (ii) mobility of termites. Either quantities were treated as the

y-variable in separate regression analyses, always with group size as the x-

variable. Survival was measured as the average number of hours spent until

individual termites die in a given group, which was calculated for each repli-

5

cate (a given test tube containing termites), using Weibull frequency distri-

bution (Crawley, 1993; Pinder III et al., 1978). Survival functions obey the

general form:

ln S(t) = µ

−αtα

(1)

where S(t) is the proportion of individuals from the initial cohort (the initial

group of termites) still alive at time t, α is the shape parameter, µ is the

mean number of hours until death by the termites from a given replicate.

The ﬁrst step in the survival analysis was to establish the value of the shape

parameter α, thereby deﬁning whether or not the proportion of individuals

dying was constant through time (α = 1, dN/dt = 1/µ, exponential ﬁt). To

do so, survival curves were tentatively ﬁt to the data, simulating diﬀerent

shape parameters, one at a time, until the error deviance reached an asymp-

tote. The model obtained was then compared with a model assuming α = 1

(exponential ﬁt), on the basis of their contribution to the error deviance.

Parsimony requires to choose the exponential ﬁt (simplest model) if it does

not diﬀer signiﬁcantly (P > 0.05; χ2 tables; 1 df) from an alternative, more

complete, model.

After deﬁning the shape parameter, the next step was to calculate the

mean number of hours termites spent to die when conﬁned in each group size

(µ in equation 1 above). Each of such means represent the number of hours

spent to die averaged across all individuals belonging to a given replicate,

and are referred to as “mean time to death”. Mean times to death for each

replicate were then collapsed into a single arithimetic mean for each group

size, a valid procedure to avoid pseudoreplication eﬀects (Crawley, 1993).

6

Such a procedure produces eight means (each one represented by a dot in

Fig.1), one for each group size.

Means thereby produced were used to check whether termite survival (y-

var) would be aﬀected by group size (x-var). To do so, models were ﬁtted

to the data, starting from a null model (y = b, were b is the grand mean),

and adding new terms until achieving the best trade-oﬀ between percent of

variance explained (r2), and P -values obtained (see Table 1).

The general pattern of mobility of termites in a given replicate (a test

tube containing termites) was measured by ﬁtting a simple regression line of

the form y = b + ax, through the data points formed by plotting the number

of moving termites (y-var) against time in minutes (x-var). The slope a

of each line was used as a measurement of the general pattern of mobility

for termites belonging to that replicate. If the number of moving termites

increases as times goes by, the curve ﬁtted to the data would show a positive

slope. Conversely, a negative slope would indicate a decay in group mobility.

When no clear trend is to be observed for a given replicate, its “mobility

curve” would show a null slope. For each group size we obtained four slopes,

since there were four replicates (i.e., four test tubes containing termites). The

slope values thereby obtained were collapsed into a single arithimetic mean

for each group size aiming, as above, to avoid pseudoreplication eﬀects. Such

a procedure produces seven means (each one represented by a dot in Fig.2),

one for each group size. Such means are refereed to as the “general pattern

of mobility” for that group size.

Means thereby produced were used to check whether the general pattern

of mobility (slope a of mobility lines, see above) would depend on the size of

7

the group were termites have been conﬁned. Models were ﬁtted and selected

All statistical analyses were performed using R (Ihaka and Gentleman,

as above (see Table 2).

1996).

3 Results

The mean time to death of starved termites obeys a humped function of

group size, presenting a peak at a characteristic group size and decreasing

at both smaller and larger densities (Polynomial model, order four: F[4;3]

= 20.22 ; r2adj = 0.916; P = 0.02; Fig. 1; Table 1) Accordingly, group

activity presents a similar dependency on group size, showing a peak at

an intermediate density and decreasing at both smaller and larger values

(Quadratic model: F[2;4] = 9.095; r2adj = 0.730; P = 0.03; Fig. 2; Table

2). This quadratic model explains the data better than the simple linear

one: adding a quadratic term to the linear model, increases by 18.7% the

percentage of variance explained and improves the P -value (Table 2).

Such results are consistent across diﬀerent procedures of data analysis.

As speciﬁed above, each dot in Figs.1 and 2 represents an arithmetic mean

taken across the respective replicates. If, however, we plot the raw data (i.e.,

splitting the arithmetic means into its components), we observe the same

general shape in both curves (Figs.3 and 4).

4 Discussion

Across the Isoptera, a range of diﬀerent socially facilitated behaviours has

been extensively reported, although survival is the one that has attracted

more attention (Table 3). In all survival studies, longevity has been reported

to increase as group size increases. This may lead one to intuitively assume

an asymptotic behaviour of such a curve, accepting that very large groups

would attain the maximal possible survival rates. In this sense, the results

reported by Grass´e & Chauvin(1944) in which survival of wasps is maximal

at moderate densities (rather than at large group sizes), could be consid-

ered “aberrant”. However, a striking similarity can be observed between

such results and those found here for C. cumulans termites (Fig. 1). More

puzziling, termites from diﬀerent wild colonies of the same species show a

similar humped function, even when they have been poisoned by insecticide

(DeSouza et al., 2001). Such a convergence of results lead us to suspect that

this pattern is, in fact, biologically sound. It seems that survival of starv-

ing termite workers –at least in C.cumulans– is not asymptotically related

to group size, but obeys a humped function, in which an optimal density

(=number of individuals per unit area) assures maximal survival.

Optimal densities in social insects have already been predicted as a conse-

quence of evolutionary pathways maximising individual ﬁttness (Higashi and Yamamura,

1993). Accordingly, extraordinary lifespan is argued to derive from evolution-

ary processes in which such insects beneﬁt from sociality (Keller and Genoud,

1977). Proximate mechanisms through which optimal densities would lead

to better survival, however, are still poorly understood. Many works deal-

9

ing with cluster size in group organisms are based on optimality arguments

regarding resource usage, territory defence, anti-predatory behaviour and dis-

ease resistance (Creel, 1997; Fritz and Garine-Wichatitsky, 1996; Giraldeau and Beauchamp,

1999; Roberts, 1996; Rosengaus et al., 1998). Others, inspired on novel con-

cepts of the sciences of complex systems, would invoke a relationship between

group-size, information ﬂuxes and task performance (Adler and Gordon, 1992;

Bonabeau et al., 1998; Deneubourg et al., 1986; Gordon, 1996; Pacala et al.,

1996). The interconnected nature of such systems is thought to be the basis

for the self-organisation of a variety of cluster-related phenomen (Bonabeau et al.,

1997; Camazine, 1991; Miramontes et al., 1993; Theraulaz et al., 1995). Specif-

ically for termites, evidences seem to point out that survival is related to mo-

bility (Miramontes and DeSouza, 1996). In addtion, studies addressing in-

terindividual interactions and self-orgnisation predict the existence of group-

size eﬀects causing information transfer and behavioural diversity to reach

near optimal conditions (Miramontes, 1995; Sol´e and Miramontes, 1995). Ac-

cordingly, termites studied here present maximal values for group activity at

intermediate densities (Fig. 2), which lie in the same group-size range as the

observed survival (Fig.1). It seems,therefore, that the association between

group-size, non-asymptotic survival and greater individual activity is not

fortuitous in C.cumulans. Moreover, to the extent that mobility aﬀects the

rate of social contacts –and thereby, cooperation– our results seem to agree

to those of Avil´es (1999), who show an explicit link between cooperation,

individual ﬁtness, and group size in social organisms.

These results point out to speciﬁc mechanisms present in the dynamics of

groups that may act to regulate observables such as density, number of indi-

10

viduals and rate of social contacts, that in turn have an impact on collective

task performance. Arguably, behaviours such as colony ﬁssion, swarming,

cannibalism, or resting, may be the natural mechanisms responsible for the

regulation of the proportion of individuals in the colony.

In other words,

the patterns presented here may have unexpected consequences for under-

standing the life cycles of these organisms, and therefore are worth exploring

further.

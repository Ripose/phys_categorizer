We report on a simple model of spatial extend anti-tumor system with a ﬂuctuation

in growth rate, which can undergo a nonequilibrium phase transition. Three states

as excited, sub-excited and non-excited states of a tumor are deﬁned to describe its

growth. The multiplicative noise is found to be double-face: The positive eﬀect on

a non-excited tumor and the negative eﬀect on an excited tumor.

In the past decades, many studies have focused on biodynamics [1-4], specially noise

biodynamics [5-9]. More than ever, cancer research is now an interdisciplinary eﬀort which

requires a basic knowledge of commonly used terms, facts, issues, and concepts. Phase

transition of tumor growth induced by noises is one of the most novel foundations in recent

years [10, 11]. However, in all these studies the systems are zero-dimension and insuﬃcient

to describe the real progress in the ﬁeld of tumor growth, furthermore at present the space

has become a fundamental variable to study [1, 12, 13].

Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy remain far from good understanding, although they

as a potential practical partnership have attracted numerous attentions of scientists for at

least one decade [14, 15]. Due to the diﬀerent responses of tumor cells to chemotherapy and

immunotherapy, more recently Lake and Robinson suggested that there is an interesting and

signiﬁcative case for combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy in tumor treatment [14].

In this paper, chemotherapy and immunotherapy are joined by a spatial extend anti-

tumor model with three elements, which are (1) a spatiotemporal ﬂuctuation of growth rate

induced by chemotherapy, (2) an immune form, and (3) a spatial extend form. Based on the

analysis on its unique stochastic diﬀerential equation and relevant Fokker-Planck equation,

we will show that the spatiotemporal ﬂuctuation can lead to a transition of tumor-growth

state through both theoretical analysis and numerical calculation. Although noise-induced

phase transition is a well known phenomenon, double-faces eﬀect of a noise on a tumor

system have not been reported. Here we will show how this transition aﬀects the tumor-

growth and how the eﬀect depends on the initial state of tumor. Our results are inconsistent

with the zero-dimensional reports that suggest the ﬂuctuation of growth rate always puts

the tumor at a disadvantage [10, 11].

The tumor-growth under immune surveillance can be described by means of insect out-

break model [1, 16, 17], which in non-dimensional units is given by

1 + u2

where u is the population of tumor cells; r is their linear per capita birth rate and K is the

carrying capacity of the environment, respectively. βu2/(1 + u2) quantiﬁes the abilities of

immune cells to recognize and attack tumor cells. In general, chemotherapy can lead to a

ﬂuctuation of tumor growth, simply a ﬂuctuation of tumor growth rate r. If considering the

space of tumor-growth, the growth rate r in Eq.(1) should be rewritten as r0 + ξi(t), where

ξi(t) is the Gaussian noises, white in time and space, with zero mean and autocorrelation
hξi(t)ξj(t′)i = 2σ2δi,jδ(t − t′), in which σ2 is the noise level and i, j

deﬁned by hξi(t)i = 0,

here n(i) is the set of the 2d nearest neighbors of site i, d and D are the spatial dimension

and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, respectively.

Equations of this kind are general and cover diﬀerent tumor growth and diﬀusion phe-

nomena, especially nonequilibrium growth. We would like to track down the existence of

nonequilibrium phase transition induced by multiplicative noise, in systems described by

these equations. Such a phase transition is characterized by the appearance of multiple

steady state probability distributions pst({ui}), which has been applied successfully in nu-

merous stochastic problems [18, 19].

If set f (ui) = r0ui(1 − ui/K) − βu2

g(ui) = ui(1 − ui/K), one will obtain the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation of Eq.(2),

in Fig.1. The critical immune coeﬃcients are βc1 = 2.156 and βc2 = 2.209, respectively, which

divide the state of a tumor into three levels: excited (E), sub-excited (S) and non-excited (N).

The solution, m, of the self-consistency equation is the intersection point between F (m) = m and F (m)

noise level σ2 = 8.0 × 103.

The numerical solution of this last equation for parameter values r0 = 1.0, D = 0.01,

and σ2 = 8.0 × 10−3 is shown in Figs.1 and 2. The solution, m, as a function of immune

coeﬃcient, β, is obtained by the intersection point between F (m) = m and F (m) = y(m)

(here y(m) represents the function in the middle position of Eq.(7)). Obviously, the average

populations of tumor cells exhibit monostable state for low and high values of β, but un-

stable state for intermediate value of β. The critical points are βc1 = 2.156 and βc2 = 2.209,

which divide the states of tumor into three levels: excited state (E), sub-excited state (S),

and non-excited state (N). Here E and N correspond to stable states but S represents an

un-stable state, which has two or three possible values. This result means the state of tumor

is determined by the immune coeﬃcient for low value of noise intensity.

When the noise level σ2 increases, what will happen? To answer this question, we consider

E and N, respectively, shown in Fig.3, the stationary probability distributions pst(u) change

from monostable state to bistable state with increasing noise intensity and more quantitative

results are given by Fig.4. For a tumor with excited state, shown in Fig.4, when noise level

increase, its growth can be hold back to a sub-excited state. Conversely, for the non-excited

for Fig.2.

tumor, noise can lead the tumor to sub-excited state or even cancerization. This theoretical

results are conﬁrmed by corresponding simulations of a one-dimensional system, shown in

Fig.5, obtained through a numerical integration of the set of stochastic diﬀerential equations

(2) [22, 23]. In the simulation, we consider three sizes but not ﬁnd one-dimensional ﬁnite

size eﬀect. It is an important future work to analyze multi-dimensional phase transition of

tumor system in such a homogeneous circumstance.

In conclusion, we have found strong evidence for the existence of a noise-induced diﬀerent

nonequilibrium phase transitions of tumor growth, in which whether the noise advantage

the tumor depends on the initial state of tumor. When the tumor is excited, noise induces

a decay. On the contrary, if the tumor is inactive, the noise can stimulate its growth.

Provided that the noise results from the treatment as chemotherapy, our results suggest

that estimating the state of a tumor is a crucial work just before treatment begins.

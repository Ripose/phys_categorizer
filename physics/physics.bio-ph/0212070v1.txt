We study the synchronization of two model neurons coupled through a synapse having an activity-
dependent strength. Our synapse follows the rules of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP).
We show that this plasticity of the coupling between neurons produces enlarged frequency locking
zones and results in synchronization that is more rapid and much more robust against noise than
classical synchronization arising from connections with constant strength. We also present a simple
discrete map model that demonstrates the generality of the phenomenon.

Synchronous activity among individual neurons or
their ensembles is a robust phenomenon observed in
many regions of the brain, in sensory systems and in other
neural networks. With constant synaptic connections the
regions of neural synchronization are quite narrow in pa-
rameter space and the origin of the observed robustness
of synchronization is not clear. It is known that many
neurons in the cortex, in the cerebellum and in other
neural systems are coupled through excitatory synap-
tic connections whose strength can be altered through
activity-dependent plasticity.
Indeed, this plasticity is
widely thought to underlie learning processes, and in it-
self constitutes a broadly interesting phenomenon. Here
we discuss its role in the synchronization of neurons in a
network.

There have been recent experimental advances in the
understanding of such plasticity, and, in particular, of the
critical dependence on timing in presynaptic and post-
synaptic signaling. Two manifestations of this kind of
synaptic plasticity are the Spike-Timing Dependent Plas-
ticity (STDP) [1, 2] seen in excitatory connections be-
tween neurons, and its inverse, observed, for example, in
the connections between excitatory and inhibitory neu-
rons in the electrosensory lobe of ﬁsh [3]. The connections
between excitatory neurons through inhibitory interneu-
rons are typical in sensory systems [4, 5] and cerebral
cortex [6]. These also express synaptic plasticity [7] and
play an important role in the control and synchronization
of neural ensembles in hippocampus.

We report here on the synchronization of two model
neurons coupled through STDP or
inverse STDP
synapses. We demonstrate that such coupling leads to
neural synchronization which is more rapid, more ﬂex-
ible and much more robust against noise than synchro-
nization mediated by constant strength connections. (For
reviews, see [8, 9, 10]). We also build a simple discrete

map that illustrates the enhancement of synchroniza-
tion by activity-dependent coupling. The map allows us
to speculate about the general applicability of learning-
enhanced synchronization.

We consider here the simplest neural network: two
neurons with unidirectional, activity-dependent excita-
tory synaptic coupling. Each neuron is described by
the Hodgkin-Huxley equations with standard Na, K, and
‘leak’ currents [11]:

C

dVi(t)
dt

= −gN ami(t)3hi(t)(Vi(t) − EN a)

− gKni(t)4(Vi(t) − EK) − gL(Vi(t) − EL)
− Isyn(t) + Istim,

(1)

where i = 1, 2.

Each of the activation and inactivation variables
yi(t) = {ni(t), mi(t), hi(t)} satisﬁes ﬁrst-order kinetics

dyi(t)
dt

= αy(Vi(t))(1 − yi(t)) − βy(Vi(t))yi(t).

(2)

The parameters in these equations are given in [12].

Each neuron receives a constant input Istim forcing it
to spike with a constant, Istim–dependent frequency. The
second neuron is synaptically driven by the ﬁrst via an
excitatory current dependent on the postsynaptic V2(t)
and presynaptic V1(t) membrane voltages:

Isyn(t) = g(t)S(t)V2(t).

(3)

S(t) is the fraction of open synaptic channels. It satisﬁes
ﬁrst-order kinetics:

dS(t)
dt

= α(1 − S(t))H(V1(t)) − βS(t),

(4)

with H(V1(t)) = (1 + tanh(10V1(t)))/4.

The time dependent synaptic coupling strength g(t) is
conditioned by the dynamics of the pre- and postsynaptic

neurons. We consider two types of activity-dependent
couplings: (1) an excitatory synapse with STDP, and
(2) an excitatory synapse with inverse STDP. Through
STDP g(t) changes by ∆g(t) which is a function of the
time diﬀerence ∆t = tpost − tpre between the times of
post- and presynaptic spikes. We use the additive update
rule

for STDP, and ∆g(t) = −G(∆t) for inverse STDP. We
used A = 0.004 µ S and γ = 0.15ms−1.

We studied the synchronization properties of this cou-
pled system by setting the autonomous period of the
postsynaptic neuron to 15 ms, then evaluating the ac-
tual period of its oscillation T2 as a function of the im-
posed autonomous oscillation period T1 of the presynap-
tic neuron.
In Fig. 1 we show T1/T2 as a function of
T1 in two cases: (a) a synaptic coupling with constant
strength 0.008 µS and (b) a synaptic coupling with in-
verse STDP. In the later case the steady-state coupling
strength depends on the ratio of neuronal frequencies (c).
Its average over all T1 values is 0.002 µS, which is much
lower than the strength in the case of constant coupling.
In Fig. 1a we see the familiar ‘Devil’s Staircase’ asso-
ciated with frequency locking domains of a driven non-
linear oscillator. Only frequency locking with ratios 1:1,
2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 leads to synchronization plateaus with
signiﬁcant width. In Fig. 1b we see that the synchroniza-
tion domains are substantially broadened due to activity-
dependent coupling, especially for T1/T2 = 1. Some
synchronization plateaus exhibit multistability, which we
conﬁrmed by observing the associated hysteresis. These
results show that even a weak, but adaptive connection
with strength that is determined dynamically is able to
greatly enhance and enrich synchronization.

We also studied the robustness of this enhanced syn-
chronization in the presence of noise by adding zero
mean, Gaussian, white noise to the membrane currents of
each neuron. We examined the behaviour of the system
with RMS noise amplitudes σ = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5
nA.

For σ = 0.01 nA no phase-locking plateaus were de-
stroyed. At σ = 0.05 nA the 4:1 plateau became dis-
torted. Larger σ sequentially eliminated synchronization
plateaus until only the 1:1 plateau remained. The 1:1

eﬀect of the noise on synchronization when σ = 0.1 nA
with (a) constant and (b) inverse STDP coupling. While
in (a) most of the plateaus have disappeared, in (b) the
1:1, the 2:1 and even the 3:1 frequency locking regimes re-
mained. In sharp distinction to classical synchronization,
frequency locking through activity-dependent coupling is
signiﬁcantly more robust in the presence of noise.

To understand the mechanisms behind such a remark-
able robustness we studied the diﬀusion of oscillation
phase caused by noise. For σ = 0.5 nA in Fig. 3a we
show that in the case of 1:1 synchronization and coupling
with constant strength 0.008 µS noise-induced phase dif-

fusion results in 2π phase slips that destroy synchronized
state. Quite contrary Fig. 3b shows that in the case of
activity-dependent coupling phase slips are absent and
the phase diﬀerence does not increase. In this particular
case the strength of coupling varied around the mean of
0.0064 µS with standard deviation of 0.0026 µS.

In Fig. 4 we plot the average rate of phase slips for
diﬀerent amplitudes of the noise. In line with the above
observation we see that in the case of activity-dependent
coupling (dashed line) phase slips are suppressed in a
wide range of noise amplitudes. We argue here that this
suppression of phase slips is the primary mechanism re-
sponsible for robustness of synchronization mediated by
activity-dependent coupling. After the introduction of
a discrete map model we will discuss this mechanism in
more detail.

We also considered synchronization through an
activity-dependent synapse in the interesting case when
the presynaptic neuron produces bursts of spikes and the
postsynaptic neuron spikes irregularly. We found that
synchronization through an STDP synapse is very fast;
even a few spikes are enough for the frequency locking
to establish itself. Neurons in the same set up with con-
stant coupling synchronize much more slowly and only
if the strength of the connection is appropriate for the
given ratio of their frequencies. Hence, activity depen-
dent synapses allow adaptation ‘on the run,’ synching a
postsynaptic neuron to the ﬁring properties of its presy-
naptic partner.

To understand the above results in a general way we
have constructed a discrete time map model of periodic
generators with STDP-like coupling. This map accounts
for the dependence of the coupling strength on the ac-
tivity of generators. Take T 0
2 as the autonomous
periods of the ﬁrst and second generators. As a result of
unidirectional coupling, the period of the second genera-
tor will change by some amount ∆T each time it receives
a spike from the ﬁrst generator. Assuming initial phases
to be 0, the time of the n+1-st spike of the ﬁrst generator
and m + 1-st spike of the second generator are taken to
satisfy

In Fig. 5 we show the Arnol’d Tongues calculated for
the map (6-8) in the cases of (a) constant and (b) inverse
STDP coupling. As with the model neurons, we see that
activity-dependent coupling greatly enlarges the zones of
synchronization.

This discrete map can be further analyzed to ﬁnd its
ﬁxed points corresponding to n : m synchronization and
to examine their stability. We present here only the case
of 1:1 synchronization. Then m = n, and the system
of equations (6-8) can be written in the following simple
form:

It is this limitation that causes the suppression of phase

it much more robust against noise. The enlargement of

the coherence of fast EEG activity in the gamma band
increases in a process of associative learning.

Based on our discrete map model results, we argue
that the particular details of the signal-generating devices
(e.g. neurons) and their connections (e.g. synapses) are
not essential and the obtained results have general ap-
plicability.
In fact, we observed similar phenomena of
robust and enhanced synchronization in computer sim-
ulations of other types of periodic generators (such as
Van-der-Pol and θ-oscillators) with STDP-like activity-
dependent coupling.

that in the course of noise-aﬀected synchronization the
strength of activity-dependent coupling ajusts dynami-
cally to keep this phase relationship close to satisfaction
and, hence, suppresses phase slips.

In conclusion, we have analyzed the eﬀects of activity-
dependent coupling on synchronization properties of cou-

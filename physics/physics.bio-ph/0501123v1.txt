Spreading of bacteria in a highly advective, disordered environment is examined. Predictions
of super-diﬀusive spreading for a simpliﬁed reaction-diﬀusion equation are tested. Concentration
proﬁles display anomalous growth and super-diﬀusive spreading. A perturbation analysis yields
a crossover time between diﬀusive and super-diﬀusive behavior. The time’s dependence on the
convection velocity and disorder is tested. Like the simpliﬁed equation, the full linear reaction-
diﬀusion equation displays super-diﬀusive spreading perpendicular to the convection. However,
for mean positive growth rates the full nonlinear reaction-diﬀusion equation produces symmetric
spreading with a Fisher wavefront, whereas net negative growth rates cause an asymmetry, with a
slower wavefront velocity perpendicular to the convection.

The study of population growth is an integral part of
the biological sciences. Recently the behavior of micro-
bial species, such as bacteria, has enjoyed much mathe-
matical analysis due to the formation of intricate equi-
librium patterns [1, 2]. Due to environmental and health
concerns the behaviors in driven systems is also of inter-
est. In this regime the dynamics are typically described
using reaction-diﬀusion equations which may involve a
number of species and their interactions [1]. While much
work has been done on these types of systems, the inclu-
sion of disorder in the environment has received limited
attention. This disorder may manifest itself in a variety
of ways, from spatial variations in the available food or
in the presence of poisons to random diﬀusion constants.
In particular, a reaction diﬀusion equation with spa-
tially varying growth factors may take the following form,

where the U (~x) are spatially random growth rates and
the convection velocity v drives the population through

the environment [3].
Eq. 1 reduces to the Fisher equation, where the growth
rate a provides exponential growth which is cut oﬀ by
the nonlinear interaction term b at the system’s carrying
capacity, a/b [1]. The linear regime of Eq. 1, around the
ﬁxed points c = 0 and c = a/b, has been studied in detail
in Ref. [3]. Only some limited numerical simulation have
been performed for the nonlinear case [4]. In the limit of
large convection velocity v, ﬁxed in the y direction, and
with b = 0, a substitution of the form

allows one to obtain a simpliﬁed form of Eq. 1,

v∂tW (~x, t) = D

2W (~x, t) + U (~x, t)W (~x, t).

(3)

∇

Here y is relabeled as t and the directions perpendicu-
lar to y as ~x [3]. As the substitution (Eq. 2) contains
the exponential growth and diﬀusion in the y direction,
the function W (~x, t) describes the cross section perpen-
dicular to the convection for a population at the ’time’
t = y/v. Interestingly, this simpliﬁed equation has the
form of an imaginary time Schr¨odinger equation with a
random, ﬂuctuating potential. Additionally it is directly
connected to the problem of directed polymers in random
media [5]. It has been shown that Eq. 3 predicts super-
diﬀusive growth for the long time, large distance behav-
ior, with an exponent of 2/3 in one spatial dimension [3].
This exponent has been reproduced numerically by ex-
amining the averaged mean squared displacement of the
optimal path (lowest energy path) in directed polymers
[5]. Through a detailed examination of the full concentra-
tion proﬁles of Eq. 3, this report examines the behavior
of this simpliﬁed equation in the context of population
growth with the goal of obtaining a better understanding
of the full equation’s (Eq. 1) behavior in both the linear
(b = 0) and nonlinear (b > 0) regimes. First a perturba-
tion analysis of Eq. 3 yields a crossover time dividing pure
diﬀusion and the super diﬀusive behavior. Afterwards,
one dimensional numerical simulations describe concen-
tration proﬁles and anomalous growth of Eq. 3 and test
the predictions for the diﬀusion exponent and crossover
time.

To obtain a perturbation expansion for Eq. 3, ﬁrst note
that it is an initial value problem. Thus, in the spirit of
Ref. [6], one applies a Fourier-Laplace transform,

A graphical representation of Eq. 5 and its second or-

ing the disorder average the ﬁrst order term drops out.

When the second term on the right side of Eq. 7 be-
comes on the order of one, then pure diﬀusion is no longer
the dominant term. The crossover time is proportional to
the value of ω−1 at this point. From Eq. 7 the crossover
time T is given by,

T =

48πdv2
Sdlt∆2 .

The crossover time depends on both the velocity of the
ﬂow as well as the width of the distribution of random
growth rates. When the velocity increases, the system
is pushed through the random environment before it has
time to experience the ﬂuctuations, seeing an eﬀectively
averaged environment. Hence it makes sense that T is
increased by higher velocities. On the other hand, in-
creasing the width of the random distribution of growth
rates creates optimal paths in the system which have
larger eﬀective growth rates. This causes pure diﬀusion
to break down earlier, hence the inverse dependence with
the crossover time.

Numerical simulations of Eq. 3 were performed in one
spatial dimension using a Runge-Kutta technique [7]. A
Gaussian initial condition of unit variance was centered
on a lattice of 20000 sites. This was large enough to
insure that the boundaries were never encountered by
the concentration. The random growth rates depend on
time, and so must be updated during the simulation. To
provide equal time and space lattice constants, a Runge-
Kutta step size of 0.1 was chosen and the growth rates
were updated after every ten time steps. Lastly, the con-
centrations were normalized after every time step.

The initial concentration proﬁle mimics the inocula-
tion of a medium with an initial bacterial sample. With
no disorder present the Gaussian shape would persist,
with a variance increasing in time. However, the dis-
order destroys this by providing particularly favorable
paths along which growth may occur. In Fig. 2 concen-
tration proﬁles are shown for two diﬀerent times after
inoculation. The top two plots contain proﬁles for a sin-
gle disorder realization. For the short time there is very
little deviation from the purely diﬀusive situation. On
the other hand, the large time concentration proﬁle devi-
ates greatly, with large spikes developing. These regions
correspond to the end of a path in the (x, t) space which
had particularly favorable growth rates and thus resulted
in a much larger population of bacteria than would be ex-
pected from a homogeneous environment. For the long
times, these paths may end with increasing distance from
the original starting position eﬀectively shifting the mean
position of the concentration from the starting position.
There may also be several competing paths that have
nearly the same eﬀective growth rate resulting in sev-
eral concentration spikes in the proﬁle. These behaviors
do not occur in the homogeneous case as the spreading
Gaussian proﬁle always remains centered on the starting
point and symmetric about that point. Upon perform-
ing a disorder average, as seen in the bottom of Fig. 2,
the large, oﬀ-center peaks result in average concentra-
tion proﬁles whose widths increase faster then the purely
diﬀusive case.

The concentration proﬁles in Fig. 2 were normalized to
have a clear comparison with the case of pure diﬀusion.
As no growth terms are present in Eq. 3 when U = 0,
the latter case remains normalized. This breaks down in

A Gaussian of unit variance was used as the initial proﬁle.

fusive case. A maximal and several characteristic error bars

the former case however. Even though U has a zero aver-
age, ﬂuctuations in the growth factors lead to anomalous
growth. Although the eﬀective growth is relatively small,
corresponding to a = 0.00223/lt in Eq. 1 for the system
shown in Fig. 2, at the longest times (t = 500000lt) the
eﬀects are profound as the total population becomes on
the order of e1100. Clearly a diverging bacterial density is
unphysical. It emerges here because the nonlinear death
term has been dropped in the simpliﬁed equation, Eq. 3.
A simple argument for the appearance of this anoma-
lous growth lies in the asymmetry between the growth
and death processes. In particular, consider a small con-
centration of bacteria present in a favorable environment,
U > 0. This concentration will grow exponentially in
time and will spread additional concentration to neigh-
boring areas via diﬀusion. On the other hand, in an
unfavorable environment for growth, with U < 0, the
local population will experience an exponential decay in
concentration. While this decreases the total local pop-
ulation, the decrease imposed in neighboring areas is not
the opposite of the growth case. The asymmetry lies in
the fact that the local (and total) population cannot fall
below zero. One cannot have a negative number of or-
ganisms. Hence the diﬀerence in concentration between
neighboring sites, proportional to the rate of transport,
is smaller with U < 0 leading to a reduced rate of pop-
ulation loss compared to the gain in population when

(solid line) and the purely diﬀusive case (dashed line). The
two curves begin with a power-law of 0.5, but for long times
the disordered case switches to a power-law of 0.647 ± 0.001,
shown as a dot-dash line. (b) Crossover times for variation
of ∆ with v = 4.0 (squares) and variation of v with ∆ = 1.0

varying ∆ and v respectively. Each point is averaged over
3000 random conﬁgurations with statistical error bars on the
order of the symbol size.

U > 0. Therefore the asymmetry of the diﬀusion pro-
cess in the random environment leads to an eﬀectively
increased growth rate.

To measure the diﬀusion exponent, the width of the
disorder averaged concentration proﬁle, as shown in Fig.
2, was measured as a function of time. The resulting
curve is shown in Fig. 3(a). For pure diﬀusion the proﬁle
width grows as t0.5 as one expects. The disordered case
is diﬀerent, with two regions of clearly diﬀerent power-
law behaviors. For small times the disordered width fol-
lows the behavior of the purely diﬀusive case. However,
as the time becomes large, the disordered case deviates
from pure diﬀusion and instead grows with a power-law
exponent equal to 0.647
0.001. This super-diﬀusive
behavior is in good agreement with the exponent value
2/3 that has been previously predicted [3]. As explained
above, this super-diﬀusive behavior arises due to the ap-
pearance of optimal growth rates that deviate far from
the center of the population. Upon averaging, these shift
concentration from the center of the proﬁle resulting in
a width wider then the diﬀusive case.

±

A clear crossover to super-diﬀusive behavior is seen in
Fig. 3(a). However, the location of this crossover depends
on the simulation parameters. For the simulations, the
predicted crossover time, Eq. 8, becomes T = 24πv2/∆2.
Compared to the visually apparent crossover point in Fig.
3(a), the prediction of T
75 is roughly an order of mag-
nitude too small. This should not be completely unex-
pected as Eq. 8 really describes the time where departure
from purely diﬀusive behavior begins. At this point the
width is growing super diﬀusively, but does not saturate
at the full exponent until t

the linear case, b = 0, show super-diﬀusive spreading perpen-

nonlinear case b > 0 with a < 0 and ∆ = 3, has a wavefront
that propagates more slowly in the direction perpendicular
to the convection, resulting in the opposite asymmetry. For
comparison, the dashed lines show the homogeneous, linear
case in (a), and a circle, such as is obtained for the nonlinear

The crossover time’s dependence on the velocity and
random width of the growth rates is shown in Fig. 3(b).
These times were obtained at the point where the diﬀer-
ence in width between the disordered and purely diﬀu-
sive case was equal to that of a baseline case (v = 4 and
∆ = 1) at roughly the crossover time predicted by Eq.
8, t = 1200. The crossover times agree very well with

As the simpliﬁed equation describes the cross section
of Eq. 1 perpendicular to the convection, it implies that
Eq. 1 with b = 0 should exhibit super-diﬀusive behavior
in that direction. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 4(a), the concen-
tration contours for a two-dimensional simulation of this
linear case shows contours of width equal to the homo-
geneous case in the direction parallel to the convection,
but spreading faster perpendicular to it.

As noted above, the linear case is not physical for long
times due to unrealistic organism densities. The nonlin-
ear case with b > 0 presents a much diﬀerent spreading
picture. For a > 0 a symmetric Fisher wave [1] develops.
This symmetry should not be completely unexpected. In
the linear case, the mechanism for the enhanced spread-
ing perpendicular to the convection was the disorder av-
eraging of the large, asymmetric concentration spikes,
such as shown in Fig. 2. Since these spikes are cut oﬀ
by the carrying capacity, this behavior is absent in the
nonlinear case and spreading is symmetric. The spread-
ing is still enhanced, however, as the wavefront velocity
increases with increasing disorder.
In particular, out-
side the wavefront the linear regime applies and enhanced
growth is found. Thus, one may argue [8] that the growth

Here aeﬀ is the eﬀective growth rate of the corresponding
linear problem which depends on the disorder strength ∆.
Numerical simulations of Eq. 1 for a range of disorders
ﬁnd excellent agreement with this wavefront velocity [8].
The wavefront velocity expression, Eq. 9, has an im-
portant implication. Namely, attempting to poison or
destroy a colony of organisms, by applying a < 0, may
fail if the disorder creates suﬃciently enhanced growth,
aeﬀ >
a. Even more interesting, the resulting wave-
front is asymmetric but in the opposite manner to the
above linear case. Figure 4(b) shows the wavefront ob-
tained from a numerical simulation of Eq. 1 with b > 0
but a < 0. The direction parallel to the convection has a
wavefront velocity that follows Eq. 9, but the perpendicu-
lar wavefront velocity is smaller, resulting in an asymmet-
ric droplet. Qualitatively, the smaller wavefront velocity
arises due to the loss of optimal growth paths. The net
negative growth rate does not allow paths passing regions
of random, negative growth rates which were previously
possible due to the additional positive growth factor. The
parallel direction is unaﬀected, because detours around
these lost paths may take place on each side of the lost
paths. However, if the lost path occurs on the edge of
the growing droplet, only paths nearer the droplet center
remain, resulting in a reduced spreading speed.

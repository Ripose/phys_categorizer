Abstract

Two mathematical methods, the Fourier and wavelet transforms, were used to

study the short term cardiovascular control system. Time series, picked from

electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure lasting 6 minutes, were analyzed

∗Part of the results were reported at the 53rd Autumn Meeting of Italian Society of Physiology,

16-19 September, 2002, Ferrara, Italy. A short abstract was published in European Journal of

Physiology R31, 445 (2003).

in supine position (SUP), during the ﬁrst (HD1), and the second half (HD2)

of 90◦ head down tilt and during recovery (REC). The wavelet transform was

performed using the Haar function of period T = 2j (j = 1,2,

,6) to obtain

wavelet coeﬃcients. Power spectra components were analyzed within three

bands, VLF (0.003-0.04), LF (0.04-0.15) and HF (0.15-0.4) with the frquency

unit cycle/interval. Wavelet transform demonstrated a higher discrimination

among all analyzed periods than the Fourier transform. For the Fourier anal-

ysis, the LF of R-R intervals and VLF of systolic blood pressure show more

evident diﬀerence for diﬀerent body positions. For the wavelet analysis, the

systolic blood pressures show much more evident diﬀerence than the R-R in-

tervals. This study suggests a diﬀerence in the response of the vessels and the

heart to diﬀerent body positions. The partial dissociation between VLF and

LF results is a physiologically relevant ﬁnding of this work.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Physiological background

Like all other animals, human body must monitor and maintain a constant internal

environment. At the same time, it must monitor and respond to the external stimulus. Two

integrated and coordinated organ systems, the nervous system and the endocrine system,

are responsible for these two functions. The nervous system monitors and controls nearly

every organ system through a series of positive and negative feedback loops. The central

nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system connects

the central nervous system to the other parts of the body. There are two subdivisions in the

peripheral nervous system, the somatic and the automnomic. The somatic nervous system

includes all nerves controlling the skeletal muscular system and external sensory receptors.

The somatic nervous system is involved in voluntary control. The autonomic nervous system

is that part of the peripheral nervous system which controls internal organs which are not

under conscious control. The autonomic nervous system has two subsystems, sympathetic

and parasympathetic. The sympathetic nervous system is involved in response to stress

conditions. The parasympathetic is involved in relaxation. Each of these subsystems usually

operates in the reverse of the other. Many organs are innervated by both of them, and their

levels of activity are reciprocally balanced to maintain homeostasis.

The autonomic nervous system controls muscles in the heart. It directly controls the

cardiovascular system, both of its electrical and mechanical properties. Via its excitation,

inhibition and modulation, it regulates both the heart rate and the propagation of cardiac

electrical activity. The autonomic nervous system controls a wide range of variables, includ-

ing arterial pressure, cardiac output, blood ﬂow, and vasomotor tone. It is responsible for

the immediate response of the heart and the blood vessels to internal noise courses as well as

external perturbations. The former includes respiration, digestion, emotion, and etc. The

latter includes body posture, physical activity, temperature, and others.

3

In a healthy individual, the beat-by-beat adjustment of hemodynamic parameters by the

autonomic nervous system is essential to an adequate cardiovascular functioning. Therefore,

cardiovascular control, as expressed by the time-dependence of hemodynamic variables, is a

direct reﬂection of autonomic activity. It may be used as a probe of autonomic performance

or maturation and a detector of possible autonomic malfunction.

Spectral analysis of variablity in heart rate and blood pressure provides a quantita-

tive noninvasive means of assessing the functioning of the short-term cardiovascular control

systems. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity makes frequency-speciﬁc con-

tributions to power spectra [1] of heart rate and blood pressure.

B. Motivation and objectives

Due to the regulation mentioned above, one can design experiments relating to internal

noises and/or external perturbations to investigate the responsiveness of autonomic nervous

system. This is the basic motivation and objective of the research in this line. Many

interesting results have been achieved [2–5]. The present research was made on commitment

of Italian Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico (a group of volunteer helpers for rescue in diﬃcult

environments) to study body changes in helpers who often must go in head-down positions

to rescue wounded persons in caves or under ruins of crushed buildings. Speciﬁc objective

of this research is to study the response of autonomic nervous system to body positions by

spectral analysis of both heart rate variability and systolic blood pressure.

The structure of the following part of this paper is as follows: In Sect. II we describe the

methods used in this research, which include how we chosed the subjects, how recorded the

physiological signals, how picked out time-series for the further study, numerical tools and

statistics. Section III gives the numerical results and physiological interpretations, which is

the core of this paper. We draw a conclusion in Sect. IV.

II. METHODS

A. Subjects and database

We studied nine male subjects (33

5.7 years old) labelled as DE, GI, LO, PI, PS, RA, SA,

±

SC, and TA, respectively. For each subject we recorded the electrocardiogram (ECG) and

the blood pressure (BP) signals for consecutive four times. The BP signals was obtained by

photoplethysmographic recording of a sphygmogram at a ﬁnger of the right hand, maintained

throughout all the experiment at the same hydrostatic level as the heart. The initial status

is supine and the recording time is 6 minutes (SUP). Then the body position of the subject

was slowly, in about 20 seconds, tilted to 90◦ head down (HD). Just after the transition of

body posture, a second set of signals of 6 minutes (HD1) was recorded. After that keeping

the head down position for about 10 minutes, then a third set of signals of 6 minutes (HD2)

was recorded. Finally the body position of the subject was slowly recovered to supine and

the fourth set of signals of 6 minutes (REC) was recorded.

The lower frequency limit 0.02 Hertz (Hz), corresponding to the higher period limit

50 seconds, is typical and adequate for human adults when performing short-term spectral

analysis. A generally accepted trace length should contains approximately ﬁve full periods of

the slowest investigated ﬂuctuation [6]. Our data length is about 360 seconds. The sampling

rate is 1000 Hz. So both the sampling rate and the trace length are acceptable.

B. PQRST Sequence and time-series

Readily recognizable features of the ECG wave pattern are designated by the letters P,

Q, R, S, and T. The wave itself is often referred to as PQRST or QRS complex. Aside

from the signiﬁcance of various features of the QRS complex, the timing of the sequence of

the QRS complexes over tens, hundreds, and thousands of heart beats is also signiﬁcant.

These inter-complex times are readily measured by recording the occurrences of the peaks

of the large R waves. The number of R-R intervals within one minute is the generally called

5

heart rate. From the ECG, the R-R intervals compose our original time-series

, where

i is the index of the R peak or the index of the R-R intervals. Similarly, from the blood

pressure, the systolic blood pressures (SBP) compose our original time-series

, where

τi}

{

yi}

{

i is the index of the peak of SBP or the index of the SBP-SBP intervals. Here we stress

the original to distinguish them from the resampled ones. Our numerical tools, Fourier

transform and wavelet transform, require that the time series be evenly distributed. From

the interval-based point of view time-series

are evenly distributed, while from

the time-based point of view,

τ (ti)

and

are unevenly distributed. The two kinds

of time-series describe the same physiological process in a little diﬀerent ways. If one wants

and

}

to use the time-based time-series for spectrum analysis, he needs to resample them.

In

this research the used resampling time interval is 0.25 second, which results in a Nyquist

critical frequency [7] 2 Hz. One must care the correspondence of the frequency unit and

that of the used time-series. If one uses the interval-based time-series, the frequency unit is

cycles/interval. If one uses time-based time-series, the frequency unit is cycles/(time unit).

If the time unit is second, then the frequency unit is Hz. For typical interbeat interval

sequences, the two kinds of frequency units are correlated by a formula [5]

ftime = finterval/E[τ ],

(1)

where E[τ ] represents expectation value of the R-R intervals, ftime and finterval are respec-

tively the time-based and the interval-based frequency. The values of E[τ ] for all subjects

and the four body positions are shown in Table I. The mean value of systolic blood pressure

is also an important measure for the body conditions. The corresponding values are shown

C. Fourier transform

The spectral analysis based on Fourier transform is by far the most used quantitative

method for the analysis of physiological signals. Moreover, it has reached importance as

a diagnostic tool. Fourier transform allows the separation and study of diﬀerent rhythms

which are intrinsic for the physiological signals. It makes simple a task that is diﬃcult to

perform visually when several rhythms occur simultaneously.. The following is the deﬁnition

of the discrete Fourier transform used in the present research,

where

xj}

{

is the used time-series and

is the corresponding Fourier transform, N is

the number or length of the time-series. With this deﬁnition, what the power spectrum

shows is mean contribution of each data in the time-series. From the statistical point of

view, the power spectrum is independent of the length of the time-series if it is stable during

7

the measuring time. In fact the nonstationarity generally exists if the measuring time is

long. But the present research is focused on short term cardiovascular control system. A

drawback of the traditional Fourier transform is that one can not observe the time behavior

of the speciﬁc frequency components. This defect is partially resolved by using the Gabor

transform [8], also called short time Fourier transform, which ﬁrst modulates the time-series

with an appropriate window function, then performs the Fourier transform. The window

function peaks around a given time and falling oﬀ rapidly, thus emphasizing the signal

localized at the central and suppressing the distant times. If one shifts the window along

the time, the time behavior will be observable.

D. Wavelet transform

The Gabor transform still has a defect, the window width is ﬁxed. In recent years phys-

iological time series have been considered in a more general framework of fractal functions.

See, e.g. [9]. An extensively used method in this kind of studies is the wavelet transform

[10], with which the window width is also adjustable. Wavelet analysis has proved to be a

useful technique for analyzing signals at multiple scales [11–17]. It permits the time and

frequency characteristics of a signal to be simultaneously examined, and has the advantage

of naturally removing polynomial nonstationarities.

The continuous wavelet transform maps a signal with one independent variable t onto

a function with two independent variables, a and b. This procedure is redundant and not

eﬃcient for algorithm implementations. A more practical and convenient choice is to use a

dyadic discrete wavelet transform. For the sequence

, it is deﬁned as follows,

τi}

{

Wm,n =

1
√m

N −1

i=0

τiψ(

m −

n),

(3)

where the quantity ψ is the wavelet basis function, and N is the length of the time-series,

m is scale which is related to the scale index j by m = 2j, and n is the translation variable.

The interpretation of wavelet coeﬃcients depends on the shape of the basis function. Both

8

j and n are nonnegative integers. The term dyadic refers to the use of scales which are

integer powers of 2. This is an arbitrary choice. The wavelet transform could be calculated

at arbitrary scale values, although the diadic scale enjoys some convenience of mathematical

properties [5,12]. In this research we used the Haar wavelet,

which has been used in some physiological signals analyses. [For example, see Ref. [17].] An

extensively used measure devised from the wavelet transform is the standard deviation of

the wavelet coeﬃcients as a function of scale [5]:

where the expectation is taken over the time-series, and is independent of n. In Ref. [17]

the Haar wavelet is shown to be suitable for scale-dependent measures of σ.

E. Frequency bands

The periodogram covers a broad range of frequencies which can be divided into bands

that are relevant to the presence of various cardiac pathologies. The power within each band

is calculated by integrating the power spectral density over the associated frequency range.

The divisions of frequency bands in the literatures are not exactly the same. A commonly

used division in heart rate variability (HRV) is shown in Table III [5], where VLF means

the band of very low frequencies, LF means the band of low frequencies, HF means the

band of high frequencies. The unit for this table is cycle/interval. So the boundaries of

frequency bands have a shift with the mean value of the R-R intervals, thus are related to

speciﬁc subject and speciﬁc body conditions. In this research we used this division. Under

the context without ambiguity, VLF, LF and HF are also used to denote the powers of

corresponding frequency bands. The power of VLF maybe correlated to the oscillations

9

of blood vessels. The power of LF may reﬂect both the sympathetic and parasympathetic

activities. Eﬀerent parasympathetic activity is a major contributor to the power of HF [5].

Table III: A division of frequency bands. The frequency regime is divided into three bands, very low

frequencies (VLF), low frequencies (LF), and high frequencies (HF). The unit for this table is cycle/interval.

VLF 0.003-0.04

LF 0.04-0.15

HF 0.15-0.4

F. Statistics

To evaluate the performance of diﬀerent measures, one needs to do some statistics.

Comparisons among the four successive body positions, SUP, HD1, HD2 and REC, are ﬁrst

performed by an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test for repeated measures. The ANOVA

test takes into account not only changes in mean values and standard deviation, but also

changes occurring in each subject in diﬀerent experimental conditions. This test is considered

signiﬁcant when p < 0.05, where p is the probability that the data contained in the four

groups of measures are not diﬀerent, but they are randomly extracted from the same pool

of data. It is commonly accepted in biological measurements that, if such a probability is

less than 5%, the diﬀerent groups of measures can not be considered as randomly extracted

from the same pool, but some real diﬀerence does exist among them. This procedure should

ﬁrst be employed when comparisons are made among three or more groups of measures,

due to mathematical considerations about the interdependence of the measures in diﬀerent

groups and their degree of freedom. In other words, it is commonly accepted that, if we

have three or more groups of measures we can not immediately compare them two-by-two,

but an overall assessment of the variance must be made ﬁrst. If the ANOVA test gives a p

value less than 0.05, special post-ANOVA tests can be made to compare two-by-two each

group of measures with the others. If the ANOVA test gives a p value larger than 0.05, we

10

can not get much meaningful information from it. But the t-test-2 analysis still can be used

to compare measures of each two of the four groups.

T-test-2 is a hypothesis testing for the diﬀerence in means of two samples. We used the

software, MATLAB, for these statistic computations. For two samples, x and y, t-test-2

in MATLAB presents three quantities, h, signiﬁcance and ci. The value of h is a t-test

to determine whether two samples from a normal distribution in the samples could have

the same mean when the standard deviations are unknown but assumed equal. The result

is h = 1 if you can reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level, and is h = 0

otherwise. In this research, h = 1 means that signiﬁcant diﬀerence is found from diﬀerent

body positions. The signiﬁcance is the p-value associated with the T-statistic

T =

¯y

n + 1

m

,

sq

(6)

where s is the pooled sample standard deviation, n and m are the numbers of observations

in the x and y samples, and ¯x and ¯y are the corresponding expectation values. The value

of signiﬁcance is the probability that the observed value of T could be as large or larger

by chance under the null hypothesis that the mean of x is equal to the mean of y. The

quantity ci is a 95% conﬁdence interval for the true diﬀerence in means. In fact in present

research, the t-test-2 analysis was done for any value of p from the ANOVA. In the case of

the ANOVA p < 0.05, t-test-2 plays a similar role to that of the post-ANOVA.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Fourier analysis

Before the Fourier transform, we ﬁrst used the Hamming window function [18] to mod-

ulate the time-series, then subtracted the mean value and rescaled the time-series so that

the mean value is zero and the standard deviation is 1. The powers of VLF, LF and HF are

averaged over diﬀerent shifts of the window function. For Fourier transform of the resampled

11

time-series, the used window width is 256 seconds (1024 points). For Fourier transform of

the original interval-based time-series, the used window width is 256 intervals.

Figure 1 shows the power spectra of a subject for the consecutive four body status. Here

we used the resampled time-based time series, so the frequency unit is Hz. In each case, the

solid line is for the R-R intervals and the dashed line is for the systolic blood pressure. The

status of the body position is also shown in the inset of each ﬁgure. It is clear that (i) the

most of power is localized with the frequency regime 0 < f < 0.4, (ii)the contribution of

diﬀerent frequency components varies with diﬀerent body positions. For the R-R intervals of

this subject, the power in the low frequency part decreased during the transition from SUP

to HD1, and increased from HD1 to HD2. The behavior of the systolic blood pressure are

not exactly the same as that of the R-R intervals. The power spectra for diﬀerent subjects

show evident diﬀerence which may due to personal conditions as well as respiratory status.

That is beyond the scope of the studies described in this paper. What one cares is not the

speciﬁc values, but the mean value and its statistics. The power spectra from the original

interval-based time-series give similar information.

Figure 2 shows the mean values of VLF, LF and HF for diﬀerent body positions, where the

ﬁrst column is for the R-R intervals and the second column is for the systolic blood pressures.

The error bars are also shown for comparison. These results are from the resampled time-

based time-series. From the two ﬁgures, it is clear that the VLF for both the R-R intervals

and the systolic blood pressure has a signiﬁcant decrease when the body position changes

from supine to 90◦ head down, while decrease of LF for both is less evident. A physiological

interpretation is thus: when the body position changes from supine to head down, due

to the weight of the column of blood lending from feet to the heart and the neck, the

arterial pressure sensors, which are in the aorta near the heart and in the neck, get a strong

stimulation. This is very similar to a sudden hypertension and induces a negative feedback

response. The sympathetic activity on the heart and the vessels is inhibited, while the

parasympathetic activity on the heart is increased. The inhibition of sympathetic activity

induces diﬀerent eﬀects: (i) decreasing the ability of the heart wall to increase its elastance

12

during systole, which tends to decrease the systolic blood pressure; (ii) a dilation of vessels

which decreases the Poiseuille resistance to the blood, which tends to lengthen the R-R

intervals. The parasympathetic activity does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the resistance of vessels.

So for both the R-R intervals and the systolic blood pressures, the decrease in the variability

of very low frequency components can be connected to the decrease in physiological very

slow oscillations in sympathetic activity. In HD1 status those very slow oscillations seem

to be heavily dampened by the feedback eﬀects elicited by the hydraulic mass which is

stretching pressure receptors. It is also very interesting that these eﬀects is not so evident

in the variability of low frequency components of R-R intervals and systolic blood pressures.

This could suggest that systems whose oscillations have longer time constants are more

inﬂuenced by changes in hydraulic dislocations than the more rapidly oscillating systems.

The contribution of a longer oscillation period is mainly from the peripheral vessels, whose

slow oscillations in resistance aﬀect not only blood pressures, but also, in a reﬂex way, the

R-R intervals.

After the SUP-HD1 transition the changes are reduced in the HD2 status. This agrees

with a progressive decay in the arterial pressure receptors sensitivity, which is known to be

signiﬁcantly reduced after 10-15 minutes of application of a constant mechanical stimulus.

However, during the HD2 period, a great volume of blood has been transferred from the

more elevated parts of the body (for example, legs) to the thorax, so that the recovery from

the HD2 status to the REC has the eﬀect to suddenly displace this hydraulic mass towards

the vasodilated vessels of the legs. This mimicks a sudden hypotension as in blood losses due

to hemorrhage. The sympathetic activity is enhanced as if it should counteract the eﬀects of

a hemorrhage. So the variability in very low and low frequency components of R-R intervals

becomes higher than in HD1 status, and the variability of low frequency components also

becomes higher than in HD2 status. This again suggests a diﬀerence in the response of the

vessels (mainly VLF, due to longer time constant of their oscillations) and the heart (mainly

LF, due to shorter time constants of heart rate and contractility oscillations).

Because the low frequency oscillations are inﬂuenced by both sympathetic (vessels and

13

heart) and parasympathetic (heart only) systems, it seems that very low frequency variability

is more greatly dampened and “stunned” by head-down position than the low frequency

variability. That is to say, the low frequency components of systolic blood pressure recovers

more promptly during the REC period than the very low frequency components. This

behavior suggests that the recovery of systolic blood pressure is mainly supported by recovery

in heart rate and contractility, but not in peripheral vessels resistance whose VLF power

remains low.

For the systolic blood pressure, the variability of high frequency components in both

the HD and the REC status are higher than that in the initial supine position. This can

only be a parasympathetic eﬀect (perhaps inﬂuenced by an increase in respiratory activity

in head-down position). For the R-R intervals, the behavior is not exactly the same.

For the Fourier analysis, Table IV shows the p values from the ANOVA analysis for the

three measures, VLF, LF and HF. All the p values are larger than 0.05. So this table suggests

that for any one of the three measures, among the four successive body positions, no one

shows signiﬁcant diﬀerence from the other three under the signiﬁcance level 0.05. The R-R

intervals and systolic blood pressures are facing the same situation at this point. But the LF

of R-R intervals and the VLF of systolic blood pressures are expected to be observed more

diﬀerence because their p values are relatively smaller. Let us go to the t-test-2 analysis.

Figure 3 shows the t-test-2 statistic results for any two of the four diﬀerent body positions.

The ﬁrst column is for the R-R intervals and the second column is for the systolic blood

pressures. From top to bottom, the corresponding frequency bands are VLF, LF and HF.

The position indexes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 correspond to SUP-HD1, SUP-HD2, SUP-REC, HD1-

HD2, HD1-REC, HD2-REC, respectively. We found that all the p values from the t-test-2

are larger than 0.05, so the corresponding values of h are all zero. But from the LF of R-R

intervals, two pairs of body-positions, HD1-REC and HD2-REC, show relatively smaller p

values. That tells us that the REC shows evident diﬀerence from both the HD1 and the HD2

in the LF of the R-R intervals, which is consistent with what we got and understood from

Fig. 2. From the VLF of systolic blood pressure, SUP-HD1 and HD1-HD2 show relatively

14

small p values, which also conﬁrms again what we got from Fig. 2.

B. Wavelet analysis

In this section we mainly describe the wavelet analysis on the original interval-based

time-series. The wavelet function is the Haar wavelet. The used the scale m = 2j. Since

the used window width is 1, the scale index j approximately corresponds the frequency 1/2j

cycle/interval. From Table I we know that the mean R-R interval of the nine subjects is

0.98 second in SUP, is 0.97 second in HD1, is 0.95 second in HD2 and is 1.05 second in REC.

So we can approximately evaluate the frequencies corresponding to diﬀerent scale indexes.

The correspondences are shown in Table V. Figure 4 shows the standard deviation σ of

the wavelet coeﬃcients as a function of the scale index j and the subject index. The scale

indexes are shown in the inset of the ﬁgure. For the same subject the value of σ varies with

the scale, and for the same scale the value of σ also oscillates with speciﬁc subject. This

result is for the initial SUP.

To get a statistical information on how σ behaves as a function of speciﬁc scales, Fig.5

shows the mean value of σ of the R-R intervals averaged over diﬀerent subjects. The results

for the four body positions are shown in order. The corresponding error-bars are also shown.

Figure 6 shows the same quantities but for the systolic blood pressures. During the SUP

period, the values of σ for both the R-R intervals and the systolic blood pressures show a

similar behavior. They increase with the used scale. Let us understand this result. A larger

scale corresponds to an oscillation with lower frequency. A larger value of σ means that

the strength of the oscillation with a given frequency changes more signiﬁcantly with time.

15

This result suggests that the organs in charge of lower frequency oscillations are more easily

aﬀected by other disturbance, so the corresponding oscillations show more nonstationarity

with time. This ﬁgure also suggests that the nonstationarities of nearly all the frequency

components denoted by j were lower in the HD1 and the HD2 periods than in the supine

period. In other words, the corresponding oscillations are more stable in the HD1 and the

HD2 than in the SUP. From the physiological side, it seems that when the body is receiving

a constant mechanical stimulus, some other weak internal noise or external disturbance is

less eﬀective in aﬀecting the short term cardiovascular control system. Table VI shows the

signiﬁcance values from the ANOVA analysis. Figures 7 and 8 show, respectively, the t-

test-2 results for the R-R intervals and the systolic blood pressures. The correspondences

between the position index and the position-pairs are the same as those in Fig.3. For the

R-R intervals, all the ANOVA p values are greater than 0.05, while from the t-test-2 we still

can ﬁnd evident diﬀerence for three sets of body positions, SUP-HD1, HD1-HD2, HD1-REC,

from scale j = 5, and can ﬁnd evident diﬀerence from SUP-HD2 from the scale j = 6, even

though the t-test-2 p values are larger than 0.05. These results are consistent with those of

the Fourier analysis. For the systolic blood pressures, all the ANOVA p values are small.

That is to say, at least one of the four is evidently diﬀerent from the other three. For the

scales with j = 1, 2, 3, 4, p < 0.05. The further t-test-2 gives more detailed information.

Under the condition of t-test-2 p < 0.05, (i) when j = 1, evident diﬀerence is found in

SUP-HD1; (ii) when j = 2 or 4, evident diﬀerences are found in SUP-HD1, SUP-HD2, and

HD2-REC, (iii)when j = 3 or 5, evident diﬀerences are found in SUP-HD1 and SUP-HD2,

(iv)when j = 6, evident diﬀerences are found in SUP-HD1 and HD2-REC.

It should be mention that we also used the original interval-based time-series for Fourier

analysis and used the resampled time-series for wavelet transform. But these two treatments

are less eﬀective in distinguishing diﬀerent body positions.

Table V: The approximate correspondences between the scale indexes and component frequencies.

The unit of frequency here is Hz. The correspondence changes with subject and body positions because the

mean R-R interval changes.

IV. CONCLUSION

We used two methods, the Fourier and wavelet transforms, to analyze arterial blood

pressure and heart rate temporal series recorded in four successive body positions. The 90◦

head-down position is used in this research. For the Fourier analysis, three measures, VLF,

LF and HF, were used. For the wavelet analysis, the standard deviation of the wavelet

coeﬃcients for diﬀerent scales were used. The two mathematical methods are shown to

be complementary to study given physiological signals. Time series lasting 6 minutes were

analyzed with both methods in supine position (SUP), during the ﬁrst (HD1), and the second

half (HD2)of head down tilt and after recovery (REC). The wavelet transform was performed

using the Haar function of period T = 2j (j = 1,2,

,6) to obtain wavelet coeﬃcients. Power

· · ·

spectra components were analyzed within three bands, VLF (0.003-0.04), LF (0.04-0.15) and

HF (0.15-0.4 ) with the frequency unit cycle/interval. In distinguishing two diﬀerent body

positions, the resampled time-based time-series work more eﬀectively if we use the Fourier

transform, while the original interval-based time-series work more eﬀectively if we use the

wavelet transform.

Power spectra mean values showed that (i) the HF components of blood pressure have

an increases during tilt and have a decrease during recovery; (ii) LF components of R-R

17

intervals and systolic blood pressures increase in recovery with respect to the tilt period;

(iii) VLF components of the R-R intervals and systolic blood pressures were lower in HD1

than in supine position, but increased in HD2; (iv)in recovery period VLF components of

R-R intervals return nearly to the supine value, but VLF components of blood pressure

decrease during recovery with respect to during both the supine and the HD2. Wavelet

transform demonstrated a higher discrimination among all analyzed periods than the Fourier

transform, especially for the systolic blood pressures. The oscillations of each frequency

component denoted by j of the R-R intervals and the systolic blood pressures were lower

in HD1 and HD2 with respect to in SUP. For the Fourier analysis, LF of R-R intervals and

VLF of systolic blood pressure show more evident diﬀerence for diﬀerent body positions.

For the wavelet analysis, the systolic blood pressures show much more evident diﬀerence

than the R-R intervals. These data suggest a diﬀerence in the response of the vessels and

the heart to diﬀerent body positions. So the R-R intervals and the systolic blood pressures

are also complementary in reﬂecting the response of autonomic nervous system. The partial

dissociation between VLF and LF results is a physiologically relevant ﬁnding of this work.

Abstract

Protein representation and potential function are two
important ingredients for studying proteins folding,
equilibrium thermodynamics, and sequence design.
We introduce a novel geometric representation of
protein contact interactions using the edge simplices
from alpha shape of protein structure. This represen-
tation can eliminate implausible neighbors that are
not in physical contact, and can avoid spurious con-
tact between two residues when a third residue is
between them. We develop statistical alpha contact
potential using an odds-ratio model. A studentized
bootstrap method is then introduced for assessing the
95% conﬁdence intervals for each of the 210 propen-
sity parameters. We found with conﬁdence that there
is signiﬁcant long range propensity (> 30 residues
apart) for hydrophobic interactions. We test alpha
contact potential for native structure discrimination
using several sets of decoy structures, and found it of-
ten has comparable performance with atom-based po-
tentials requiring many more parameters. We also
show that accurate geometric representation is impor-
tant, and alpha contact potential has better perfor-
mance than potential deﬁned by cut-oﬀ distance be-
tween geometric centers of side chains. Hierarchical
clustering of alpha contact potentials reveals natural
grouping of residues. To explore the relationship be-
tween shape representation and physicochemical rep-
resentation, we test the minimum alphabet size nec-
essary for native structure discrimination. We found
that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in performance

to 20, if geometry is represented accurately by alpha
simplicial edges. This result suggests that the geome-
try of packing plays an important role, but the speciﬁc
residue types are often interchangeable.

Introduction

Potential function plays important roles for a vari-
ety of computational studies of proteins, including
prediction of protein structures, characterization of
ensemble thermodynamic properties of proteins, and
design of novel proteins. For example, an essential
requirement for the prediction of three-dimensional
structure of protein from primary sequence is a po-
tential function which can select the native conforma-
tion from an ensemble of alternative conformations.
Potential function is also often used to guide the sam-
pling of protein conformations [1]. A variety of poten-
tial functions have been developed for these impor-
tant tasks, including physical model based potentials
[2–4], empirical statistical potentials [5–7], and em-
pirical potentials obtained from optimization [8–12].

The eﬀectiveness of potential function depends on
another critically important factor, i.e., the represen-
tation of protein structures. Within this framework,
we explore a new type of pairwise contact potentials
using a novel contact deﬁnition. We introduce a con-
tact deﬁnition that reﬂects protein geometry more
accurately. These contacts are based on the computa-

1

tion of the alpha shape, or the dual simplicial complex
description of protein structures [13, 14]. Here con-
tact occurs if atoms from non-bonded residues share
a Voronoi edge, and this edge is at least partially con-
tained in the body of the molecule. In another word,
atoms have to be in physical nearest neighbor con-
tact. In this study, we only examine the 1-simplices,
or edges in the dual simplicial complex, which rep-
resents the pairwise contacts. This description is re-
lated to the work from Wodak’s group, where the con-
tact area between atoms are calculated as the area of
intersection of the accessible atom ball around each
atom and the faces of its weighted Voronoi cell [15].

We develop a statistical contact propensities based
on alpha edge simplices and a combinatorial null
model. To account for the uncertainty of estimated
propensity parameter, we develop a studentized boot-
strap method for estimating their 95% conﬁdence in-
tervals. We also examine how geometric represen-
tation of dual simplicial complex inﬂuence the eﬀec-
tiveness of pairwise contact potential functions.
In
addition, we aim to understand how the size of alpha-
bet of amino acid residues aﬀect the eﬀectiveness of
empirical pair potentials. This is important for pro-
tein design, where any reduction of the alphabet size
of residues will result in exponentially more eﬃcient
sampling in the sequence space, therefore leading to
more successful design strategies [16, 17].

This work is also motivated by the need to develop
potential functions that takes advantage of recent de-
velopment in computational geometry and computa-
tional topology. The alpha shape representation of
proteins from computational geometry allow rapid
calculations of metric, topological, and combinato-
rial structures of proteins precisely [14, 18, 19]. These
advantages can lead to improvements in voids and
binding site detection [18–20], in hierarchical repre-
sentation of protein dynamic shapes at diﬀerent res-
olution, and in conformation sampling. Recent the-
oretical development suggests many intriguing appli-
cations in protein studies [21–23]. These important
advances are largely unexploited currently, and we
hope this work provides a useful link by developing
empirical pairwise contact potentials based on dual
simplicial complex representations of proteins.

Our approach also solves a problem that cannot
be satisfactorily addressed with current contact pair
potentials.
In current approaches, pairwise contact
interactions are declared if two residues are within
a speciﬁc cut-oﬀ distance. Potentials based on this
contact deﬁnition have achieved considerable success.

Nevertheless, contacts by distance cut-oﬀ can poten-
tially include many implausible non-contacting neigh-
bors, which have no signiﬁcant physical interaction
[24]. Whether or not a pair of residues can make
physical contact depends not only on the distance
between their center positions (such as Cα or Cβ,
or geometric centers of side chain), but also on the
size and the orientations of side-chains [24]. Further-
more, two atoms close to each other may in fact be
shielded from contact by other atoms. As emphasized
in [25], these contact pairs should not contribute to
the assessment of pairwise contacts. By occupying
the intervening space, other residues can block a pair
of residues from interacting with each other. Inclu-
sion of these ﬁctitious contact interactions would be
undesirable.

We organized this paper as follows. First, we de-
scribe brieﬂy the dual simplicial complex represen-
tation of proteins structures. We then discuss the
probabilistic models for developing pairwise poten-
tials. A bootstrap resampling procedure is then intro-
duced which provide conﬁdence intervals of estimated
pairwise potential parameters. We then present the
pairwise contact potential along with experimental
results in discriminating native structure against de-
coy structures using several benchmark data sets. We
further examine how pair potentials developed from
the dual simplices compare with cut-oﬀ contact def-
initions using side-chain centers. The eﬀects of re-
duced alphabet size for amino acid residues are then
described. We conclude with remarks and discussion.

2 Model and Methods

Alpha Contacts from Dual Simplicial Com-
plex. Alpha shape has been successfully applied to
study a number of problems in proteins, including
void measurement, binding site characterization, pro-
tein packing, electrostatic calculations, and protein
hydrations [14, 18, 20, 26–30]. Details of alpha shape
have been described elsewhere, here we only provide
a brief description for completeness.

To illustrate, Figure 1a shows a two-dimensional
molecule formed by a collection of disks of uniform
size. Each Voronoi cell is deﬁned by its boundaries,
shown as broken lines. Every Voronoi edge is a per-
pendicular bisector of the line between two atom cen-
ters. Each Voronoi cell contains one atom, and ev-
ery point inside a Voronoi cell is closer to this atom
than to any other atom. Three connected Voronoi

edges meet at a Voronoi vertex. Another geomet-
ric construct, the Delaunay triangulation (Fig 1b) is
mathematically dual to the Voronoi diagram, and can
be explained by the following procedure. For each
Voronoi edge, connect the corresponding two atom
centers with a line segment, and for each Voronoi
vertex, place a triangle spanning the three atom cen-
ters of the three Voronoi cells. Completing this for
all Voronoi edges and Voronoi vertices gives a collec-
tion of line segments and triangles. Together with
the vertices representing atom centers, they form the
“Delaunay complex”, which is the underlying struc-
ture of Delaunay triangulation.

Now we remove all Delaunay edges (or line seg-
ments) where corresponding Voronoi edge of the two
atoms does not intersect with the molecular (Fig-
ure 1c)). When two atoms are spatially very close, the
balls representing the two atoms intersect, and these
two atoms have non-zero, two-body volume overlap.
When three atoms are spatially very close, they inter-
sect and have non-zero, three-body volume overlap.
We further remove all Delaunay triangles where the
corresponding Voronoi vertex of the three atoms is
not contained within the molecule. The subset of the
Delaunay complex formed by the remaining triangles,
edges and vertices (atom centers) is called the dual
simplicial complex, or the alpha complex. We are in-
terested in identifying only contacting atoms that are
spatial nearest neighbors. These are precisely atoms
with two-body volume overlaps whose Voronoi cells
intersect. By following the mathematical dual struc-
ture, i.e., the edges in the alpha complex, we can
accurately identify all contacting nearest neighboring
atom pairs. For convenience, we use a rather arbi-
trary criterion and declare two residues are in alpha

contact if there is at least one edge connecting these
two residues.

Using the alpha shape API kindly provided by
Prof. Edelsbrunner, a program interface has been
implemented to compute contacting atoms based
on precomputed Delaunay triangulation and al-
pha shape. The Delaunay triangulation is com-
puted using the delcx program, and the alpha
shapes computed using the mkalf program. Both
can be downloaded from the website at NCSA
(http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu). The van der Waals
radii of protein atoms are taken from [31]. We follow
Singh & Thornton and increment the van der Waals
radii by 0.5 ˚A[32]. This increment is small and com-
parable with the resolution of the structure. It en-
ables the modeling of imprecisely determined atomic
coordinates without introducing many spurious two-
body contacts.

Probabilistic Model for Pairwise Alpha Con-
tact Propensity. The propensity P (i, j)
for
residue of type i interacting with residue of type j
is modeled as the odds ratio of the observed proba-
bility q(i, j) and the expected probability p(i, j) of a
pairwise alpha contact involving both residue i and
j, :

P (i, j) =

q(i, j)
p(i, j)

(1)

To compute p(i, j) and q(i, j), we choose a simple null
model, where the observed contacts of diﬀerent pro-
teins in the entire database are pooled together, and
the expected contact numbers are calculated. This
is the same as the reference state of composition-
independent scale discussed in literature [33]. We
have:

q(i, j) =

a(i, j)
Pi′,j′ a(i′, j′)

Here, a(i, j) is the number count of atomic con-
tacts between residue type i and residue type j, and
Pi′,j′ a(i′, j′) is the total number of all atomic con-
tacts. The observed probability is then compared
against the random probability p(i, j) that a pair of
contacting atoms is picked from a residue of type i
and a residue of type j, when chosen randomly and
independently [34]. We have:

p(i, j) = NiNj·(

ninj
n(n − ni)

+

ninj
n(n − nj)

),

when

i 6= j

p(i, j) = NiNi−1 ·

when

i = j

nini
n(n − ni)

,

and

where Ni is the number of interacting residues of type
i, ni is the number of atoms residue of type i has, and
n is the total number of interacting atoms.

The alpha contact potential between residue i and
residue j is obtained from the propensity value P (i, j)
as ln P (i, j), and the overall energy of a protein is
calculated as:

ǫ = − X
i,j

ln P (i, j);

Cys-Cys Interactions.
In principle, only 210 pa-
rameters are necessary for 20 amino acid residues.
However, Cys-Cys contact requires special attention.
Its propensity value is the largest compared to the
other 209 contacts, because Cys residue tends to form
disulﬁde bond with another Cys residue. Neverthe-
less, there are many Cys-Cys residue pairs that are
in close spatial proximity but do not form disulﬁde
bond. As a result, a mis-classiﬁcation of a non-
disulﬁde Cys-Cys contact as a disulﬁde bond will af-
fect the overall score considerably, especially for small
proteins with abundant Cys residues. The problem
associated with the mis-classiﬁcation of Cys-Cys con-
tact was already pointed out in [10].

To avoid assigning the same score to the two diﬀer-
ent types of Cys-Cys contacts, we introduce a slightly
more detailed propensity scores for Cys-Cys interac-
tions. Since contacts between C:O, C:N, C:C, and
O:O atoms never appear in disulﬁde bonds, a Cys-
Cys contact pair lacking these atomic interactions is
classiﬁed as a disulﬁde bond Cys-Cys contact if in
addition the distance between their SG atoms is less
than 2.5 ˚A. All other Cys-Cys interactions are classi-
ﬁed as nonbonded Cys-Cys contact. The propensity
values estimated for these two types of Cys-Cys con-
tacts are listed in Table II.

Bootstrap Resampling. Because the sample size
of 1,045 proteins in pdbselect is limited, statistical
modeling with approximations may be prone to er-
rors. It is therefore essential to assess reliability of es-
timated contact potentials. Here we apply bootstrap
techniques to calculate conﬁdence intervals from sim-
ulated data sets [35, 36]. For alpha contact potential
of a speciﬁc residue pair, (e.g., Trp-Trp), we denote
the true value of the contact potential as θ. Our
probabilistic model (Equation 1) can be regarded as
an estimator T that gives the estimated value t from
the ﬁnite amount of data for θ. Our goal is to calcu-
late a 95% conﬁdence interval for θ.

We resample 1,045 proteins independently R times
from the set of 1,045 proteins from Pdbselect , with
replacement allowed. We have a simulated data set of
Y ∗
1 , .., Y ∗
R, each contains 1,045 proteins. Some struc-
tures in the original Pdbselect set appear multiple
times, some appear once, and some never appear. We
estimate the pair contact value θ from each of the R
samples, and obtain t∗
1, .., t∗
R. For an equitailed 95%
conﬁdence interval (95% = 1 − 2α, α = 2.5%), we
have the basic bootstrap conﬁdence limits:

(t∗

(R+1)(1−α),

t∗
(R+1)α)

The accuracy of these limits depend on R, and how
well the distribution of {t∗ − t} agrees with that of
T − θ. Perfect agreement occurs only when the dis-
tribution of T − θ does not depend on any unknown
variables.

To reduce possible errors due to unknown vari-
ables, we use studentized bootstrap. For the rth boot-
strapped sample, we calculate:

z∗
r =

t∗
r − t
∗1/2
v
r

To obtain v∗
r , we bootstrap with replacement again
M times the rth sample of the original bootstrap. We
have:

v∗
r =

1
M − 1

M

X
m=1

m − ¯t∗
(t∗

)2

1, ...t∗

where t∗
M are calculated from the second boot-
strap sampling. We then use the (R + 1) · αth order
statistic of the simulated values z∗
(R+1)α
to obtain the studentized bootstrap conﬁdence inter-
val for θ:

R, or z∗

1 , ..., z∗

(t − v1/2z∗

(R+1)(1−α),

t − v1/2z∗

(R+1)α)

Since M bootstrap samples from the rth sample
are needed to obtain v∗
r , the total number of nested
bootstrap samples is (M +1)·R. We chose R = 1, 000
and M = 50. Altogether, we generate 1, 001 × 50 =
50, 050 bootstrap samples to calculate the conﬁdence
intervals for each of the 209+2 pairwise alpha contact
propensities.

Pairwise Alpha Contact Potentials. The pair-
wise alpha contact propensities are listed in Table II.
These propensities are calculated for all residue con-
tacts that are at least 3 residues away in primary

sequence. As expected, Cys-Cys has the highest
propensities for contact interactions. Other residue
pairs with the highest propensities for contact inter-
actions (P (i, j) = 1.4 − 2.5) are pairs of hydropho-
bic residues (e.g., Met-Met, Ala-Ala, Ile-Ile, Phe-
Phe, Ile-Leu, and Ile-Met). The group of residue

5

pairs with the second highest propensities (P (i, j) =
1.2 − 1.3) are ionizable residues with opposite charges
(e.g., Arg-Asp, Arg-Glu, Asp-Lys, and Gly-Lys).
Residue pairs with lowest alpha contact propensi-
ties (P (i, j) = 0.4 − 0.6) are dominated by pairs
of ionizable residues of the same charge (e.g.,Arg-
Lys, Asp-Glu, Lys-Lys, and Glu-Glu). The group
of residue pairs with the second lowest alpha contact
propensities (P (i, j) = 0.5 − 0.7) are between ion-
izable residues and hydrophobic residues (e.g., Asp-
Phe, Asp-Ile, Asp-Leu, and Glu-Val). Noticeably,
pairs of Pro and ionizable/polar residues also have
very low propensity for contacting interactions, prob-
ably due to the lack of a backbone-NH for H-bonding
interactions.

The conﬁdence intervals of these propensity val-
ues given by the studentized bootstrap procedure in-
dicate that most of them are estimated accurately.
Among the 209 parameters excluding Cys-Cys inter-
action, the 95% conﬁdence intervals for 153 contact
propensities are < 0.2, a very tight interval. The con-
ﬁdence intervals of 36 contact propensities are < 0.3.
Contact propensities with the largest conﬁdence in-
tervals around 0.6 are Trp-Trp, Met-Met, Cys-Met,
and Cys-Trp.

Correlating and Clustering Similar Amino
Acid Residues. The overall behavior of pairwise
contact interactions for a speciﬁc residue type is de-
termined by its 20 pairwise contact propensity val-
ues. These values represent a proﬁle of contact in-
teractions speciﬁc for the residue type, and can be
represented as a 20-dimensional vector x.

We group the 20 types of amino acid residues by the
Euclidean distance between the 20 vectors [34]. Fig 2
shows the grouping of the 20 amino acid residues ob-
tained by hierarchical clustering. As an exploratory
tool for data analysis, hierarchical clustering can dis-
cover interesting and informative grouping patterns
in data [39]. In Fig 2, residues that have close contact
propensity values to the 20 residue types are grouped
together.

The pattern of groupings of residues clearly re-
ﬂect the physical and geometric characteristics of the
amino acid residues. Cys residue is diﬀerent from
all other residues, because of its propensity to form
disulﬁde bond. The rest of the 19 residues can be
broadly divided into two well deﬁned branches of
hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. Among the
hydrophilic residues, ionizable residues with positive
charge and negative charge are grouped into two in-

dividual small clusters. Hydroxyl-containing residues
(Ser and Thr) and amide residues (Asn and Gln)
are also clustered into two individual small clusters.
These residues are all capable of forming side chain
hydrogen bonds, and their clusters are neighboring
with each other, forming a larger cluster of Ser, Thr,
Asn, and Gln. Among the hydrophobic residues,
the branched residues (Val, Ile, and Leu), and small
residues (Ala and Gly) are grouped into their own
clusters. Aromatic residues Trp and Tyr also group
into one cluster. Phe has strong hydrophobicity and
is group with other strongly hydrophobic amino acid
residues, rather than clustering with the other two
aromatic residues. Pro and His are grouped together,
probably because both do not form strong favor-
able contacts with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic
residues.

The clustering pattern of residues by alpha contact
propensity also resembles to a certain extent the clus-
tering pattern derived from mutation matrix BLO-
SUM50 [40] as reported by Murphy et al [41]. For
example, Arg with Lys, Asn with Gln, Ser with Thr,
and Glu with Asp are all clustered tightly with each
other. In addition to the distinct grouping of Cys in
our clustering result, a notable diﬀerence is that by
alpha contact propensity residues Ser, Thr and Pro
are grouped with hydrophobic residues instead of hy-
drophilic residues.

Table II: Discriminating native structure from decoys in
ProStar data sets using alpha contact potential (Alpha).
Results for each decoy subset are compared with those of
other potentials,
including RAPDF (Residue-speciﬁc All-
atom Conditional Probability Discriminatory Function) [6],
CDF (Contact Discriminatory Function) [6], MJ (Miyazawa
& Jernigan Potential) [5], BT (Betancourt & Thirumalai
Potential) [55] and GC (Geometry Center Based Potential).
The ﬁrst number in each cell
is the number of correctly
identiﬁed native proteins, and the second number is the to-
tal number of proteins in the subset. The ﬁrst row lists the
names of the decoy subsets. Data for RAPDF, and CDF are
taken from Figure 1b of reference [6].

Discriminating Native Structures from De-
coys. An important method to determine the eﬀec-
tiveness of contact potential functions is to evaluate
its success and failure in distinguish native protein
structures from incorrectly folded decoy structures.
We use three decoy data sets to assess alpha contact
potential.

ProStar. The decoy sets in ProStar database [6]
contain several subsets. The misfold subset contains
conformations of 25 sequences which are obtained by
placing these sequences on structures of diﬀerent folds
with the same number of residues. The conformations
of the side chains are obtained by Monte Carlo sam-
pling [42]. Alpha contact potential succeeded in iden-
tifying all 25 native structures correctly (Table IIII).

For the Asilomar subset, alpha contact potential
failed to identify 5 native structures out of 42 pro-
teins. For the ifu subset, alpha contact potential
failed for 20 out of 44 native structures. Alpha con-
tact potential belongs to the class of residue-based
potentials, similar to MJ, BT, CDF [6]. As pointed
out in [7], decoys in ifu subset are especially chal-
lenging for residue-based potentials, because they are
conformations of short loops, and have only a small
number of residue contact interactions.

In the subset pdberr and sgpa, the decoys are
structures determined by diﬀraction but contain se-
rious error, or are structures generated by molecu-

out of the ﬁve native structures.

Park & Levitt Set. This decoy test set contains
native and near-native conformations of seven se-
quences, along with about 650 misfolded structures
for each sequence. The positions of Cα of these de-
coys were generated by exhaustively enumerating ten
selectively chosen residues in each protein using a 4-
state oﬀ-lattice model. All other residues were as-
signed the phi/psi value based on the best ﬁt of a
4-state model to the native chain. Conformations
in the decoy sets all have low score by a variety of
scoring functions, and have low RMSD to the native
structure (Table IIIIII) [43].

The results of discrimination test are listed in Ta-
ble IVIV and plotted in Fig 3. For ﬁve of the seven
proteins, the native structures have lowest energy by
alpha contact potential. For protein 3icb and 4rxn,
the native structures have the 5th and 51st lowest
energy values, respectively. For all proteins, decoys
with the lowest energy are within 2.5 ˚A RMSD to the
native structure.

Table III: Description of proteins in the 4-state-reduced decoy set, Lattice-ssfit decoy set and Lmds decoy set.
The number of decoy structures and the cRMSD ranges are listed.

native structure ranks as the 5th lowest energy, the
RMSDs of the ﬁrst four lowest energy decoys are all
within 2.0 ˚A RMSD to the native structure. For a
higher resolution structure (4icb at 1.60 ˚A) of this
protein, the energy of 4icb by alpha contact poten-
tial is lower than any of the decoys.
It is possible
that this mis-classiﬁcation might be due to the lower
resolution of structure of 3icb.

Rubredoxin (4rxn) is an iron-sulfur protein. A
Fe(III) ion is covalently bound in this structure with
four Cys sulfur atoms, preventing these four Cys from
forming two possible disulﬁde bonds. Because the
protein description and the contact potential do not
contain any information about the important cova-
lent bonds of Cys with Fe-S cluster, it is reasonable
to expect that native structure will not be of lowest

energy if these important covalent bond interactions
are unaccounted for.
It is possible that the struc-
ture of rubredoxin might be diﬀerent without the Fe-
S cluster. The decoys at the lowest energy states
form one or two ﬁctitious disulﬁde bridges, and all
are near-native structures with RMSD around 2 ˚A to
the native structure. MJ and BT potential work bet-
ter on 4rxn because they classify the four Cys-Cys
contacts as disulﬁde bonds.

Lattice ssﬁt Set. The lattice ssfit set contains
conformations for eight small proteins generated by
ab initio protein structure prediction methods [44,
45]. The conformational space of a sequence was ex-
haustively enumerated on a tetrahedral lattice. A
lattice-based scoring function was used to select the
10,000 best scoring conformations. Secondary struc-

c Average ranking of native structures in energy evaluated using 1,000 bootstrapped potential values;
d The number of times of a native structure is ranked to have the lowest energy.

tures were ﬁtted to these conformations using a 4-
state model [43]. The 10,000 conformations were fur-
ther scored using a combination of an all-atom scor-
ing function [6], a hydrophobic compactness function,
and a one-point per residue scoring function [46]. The
2,000 best scoring conformations for each protein are
selected as decoys for this data set.

The result (Table IVIV) shows that for six out of
eight proteins, no decoy structures score better than
the native structure. The exceptions are 1fca and
1trl. Similar to 4rxn in the Park & Levitt decoy
set, ferrodoxin 1fca contains a Fe-S cluster. Its four
Cys residues form four covalent bond with the four
Fe(III) irons, instead of two disulﬁde bridges. These
critical contacts again are unaccounted for in the al-
pha contact potential, and therefore the native struc-
ture of this protein was not identiﬁed successfully.

1trlA is a NMR solution structure of the C-terminal
fragment (255-316) of thermolysin. NMR structures
are far more diﬃcult to recognize, as discussed in
detail in [10]. They are usually represented as an
ensemble of conformations. The contact energies of
conformations in the ensemble can be substantially
diﬀerent.
It is conceivable that an energy function
valid for crystal structures cannot reliably recognize
native NMR structures [10]. In addition, the struc-
ture 1trlA occurs in a dimeric state in the original
PDB ﬁle. There is substantial interaction between
the two chains. Because of this, it is unclear whether
single subunit of 1trlA in monomeric state would re-
tain the same conformation.

The decoy structures in this data set are generated
by ab initio methods. None of them are near-native,
and all have cRMSD to the native structure greater

9

than 4.7 ˚A (Table IVIII). When decoys are so diﬀer-
ent from the native conformation, energy evaluated
using alpha contact potential shows little correlation
with the RMSD. The lowest energy decoys in this
data set all have large RMSD, similar to results re-
ported in [47] (data not shown).

Lmds Set. The local minima decoy set (lmds) con-
tains decoys that were derived from the experimen-
tally obtained secondary structures of ten small pro-
teins that belong to diverse structural classes. Each
decoy is a local minimum of a “hand made” energy
function [48–51]. Ten thousand initial conformations
were generated for each protein by randomizing the
torsion angles of the loop regions [52]. The adja-
cent local minima were found by truncated Newton-
Raphson minimization in torsion space. Each protein
is represented in the decoy set by its 500 lowest en-
ergy local minima.

The alpha contact energy function works fairly well
in the recognition of 1b0n-B, 1ctf, 1dtk, 2cro
and 2ovo.
1dtk (Dendrotoxin K) contains three
disulﬁde bonds in its native structure. However, in
most of its 215 decoys, six Cys residues are spa-
tially arranged together and form on average seven
Cys-Cys contacts. For some decoys, up to 15 Cys-
Cys contacts by distance cut-oﬀ can be found. The
ability of discriminating disulﬁde bonded versus non-
disulﬁde bonded Cys-Cys contacts probably makes
the alpha contact potential discriminate better than
the MJ and the BT potentials. The native structure
of 1igd (IgG-binding domain from streptococcal pro-
tein G) ranks ﬁrst by the MJ and the BT potential,
but ranks 9th by alpha contact potential. The recog-
nition of 1bba and 1fc2-C in this set failed for all
residue-based contact potentials. 1bba is an atypi-
cal structure of a small protein determined by NMR,
which forms a helix with random coil. 1fc2-C is a
fragment of protein complexed with an immunoglob-
ulin molecule. It possible that this protein may not
maintain the same conformation without the com-
plexed immunoglobulin.

By the criterion of the ranking of native protein,
with the exception of the ion-sulfur proteins 4rxn and
1fca, the overall results shown in Table IVII and Ta-
ble IVIV indicates that the performance of alpha con-
tact potential in discriminating native protein from
decoys is better than that of MJ and BT potentials
for the misfold, ifu, asilomar, 4state reduced
sets and the lattice ssfit set, and has comparable
results for the lmds set, the pdberr set, and the
spga set.

4 Discussion

Contact Deﬁnition. The alpha contacts intro-
duced in this work are diﬀerent from contacts by cut-
oﬀ distances. Atoms in alpha contacts are all within
a distance that depends on the identities of the two
atoms. In this study, this distance is equal to the sum
of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms, plus
2 × 0.5 ˚A. Unlike contacts by distance cut-oﬀ, this
distance is not a single ﬁxed constant but depends
on the atom types. Another important distinction of
alpha contact is that only a subset of atoms satisfy-
ing the distance criterion will be counted as physi-
cal nearest neighbors, because we have an additional
criterion: contacting atoms must have intersecting
Voronoi cells. Alpha contacts represents the geom-
etry more accurately and can capture contact inter-
actions due to side chain size and orientation [25].
In addition, no ﬁctitious contacts will be introduced
between two atoms when there is a third interven-
ing atom [24]. Perhaps this is the reason why alpha
contact potential is sensitive to the presence of Fe-S
clusters and other hetero atoms, which can be po-
tentially exploited for determining whether a protein
structure should contain hetero atoms.

For the 1,045 proteins in the pdbselect dataset,
we compare contacts identiﬁed by distance cut-oﬀ
with the threshold of two van der Waals atom radii
plus 2 × 0.5 ˚A and contacts identiﬁed by the alpha
shape. We found that about 30 – 50 % of atom con-
tacts detected by distance cutoﬀs are blocked by a
third atom and hence do not have physical interac-
tions. As a result, 3 – 6% residue contacts detected by
distance cutoﬀs do not interact physically. Inclusion
of these ﬁctitious contact is problematic, especially in
developing all-atom contact potentials, as well as in
future studies when higher order interactions in the
form of three or four body contacts are incorporated.

Evaluating Discrimination of Alpha Contact
Propensities by Bootstrap. How robust is the
results of decoy discrimination to the speciﬁc values
of alpha contact potentials and the speciﬁc choices
of the structures in the database? We further make
use of the bootstrap resampling technique to evaluate
the reliability of the discrimination results. As dis-
cussed earlier, we resampled 1,045 proteins in Pdbs-
elect independently R = 1, 000 times with replace-
ment allowed, and obtain 1,000 contact propensity
matrices. Each is then used to discriminate the de-
coys in Table III. We use two parameters: r, the aver-

10

age ranking of the native structure, and f , the times
a native structure ranked as the structure with the
lowest energy. Table IV shows that for many decoy
sets (e.g., 1ctf, 1r69, 1sn3, 2cro, and 4pti in the
4state reduced set), the native structure always
ranks ﬁrst in the 1,000 bootstrapped energy evalu-
ations. The performance using 1,000 diﬀerent sets
of “bootstrapped” potential values validates the ro-
bustness of the method deriving the alpha contact
potential and the informativeness of the underlying
protein structure database.

Comparison with Contact by Geometric Cen-
ters. Contact deﬁnition by distance cut-oﬀ is
widely used in the development of many potential
functions. Here we compare potentials obtained by
alpha contact, denoted as Hα, and by contact deﬁned
by cut-oﬀ distance between geometric centers of side
chains, denoted as Hgc. Following reference [53], two
residues are declared to be in contact if the distance
d between the geometric centers of their side chains
is: 2˚A< d < 6.5˚A. Geometric center based contact
potential Hgc are developed using the same Pdbse-
lect data, with the same null model as that of alpha
contact potential, and similarly counting only con-
tact between residues that are three or more residues
apart. Therefore, any diﬀerence between Hα and Hgc
is solely due to diﬀerent geometric representation.

The log values of the parameters of Hα and Hgc
have an overall correlation coeﬃcient of ρ = 0.77.
However, the contact maps of individual proteins by
these two diﬀerent contact deﬁnition are often sub-
stantially diﬀerent. As an example, alpha shape dual
simplicial complex gives signiﬁcantly more contacts
than cut-oﬀ distance by geometric centers of side
chain for protein 1abe (Fig 4).

Fig 5 illustrates why such a discrepancy exists be-
tween these two contact models (see Figure 5 legend).
The strong correlation between Hα and Hgc is decep-
tive and this is reﬂected in another aspect. Although
the correlation coeﬃcient is high, the pairwise contact
potentials may have very diﬀerent values for Hα and
Hgc. Hgc categorically gives much higher propensity
values for interactions between small residues. For
example, Hgc for Gly-Gly and Ala-Gly are 4.55 and
3.04, respectively, but Hα are only 1.48 and 1.39,
respectively. Gly-Pro interaction is strongly favor-
able by Hgc (P (Gly, P ro) = 1.84), but is unfavorable
by Hα (0.87). On the other hand, Hgc gives much
lower propensity values for interactions between large
residues. For example, Hgc for Trp-Trp and Phe-Trp

interactions between Trp and another residue with
large side chains (such as Arg, Tyr, Phe, His, Leu,
Ile, and Met) are unfavorable (< 1.0) by Hgc, but are
favorable by Hα.

These diﬀerences lead to diﬀerent discrimination
in identifying native and near-native protein struc-
tures from decoy structures. Because it is impossi-
ble to deﬁne reﬁned potential for Cys-Cys contacts
in Hgc model as in alpha contact model, we exclude
proteins containing Cys-Cys contacts to avoid com-
plication for comparison. Table IVIV shows that Hgc
can only recognize two native structures out of nine
proteins in the union set of the 4-state decoy set and
the lattice-ssﬁt decoy set. In addition, the z scores for
native structures are generally higher when using Hα
than Hgc. For the 4-state decoy set, the correlation
coeﬃcient ρ by Hα is also higher. These results indi-
cate that geometric description of protein structures
are important, and contact model by alpha shape are
more accurate with more discriminative information
for identifying native-like structures. However, the
cut-oﬀ distance approach may be more convenient to
implement, and it is possible to gain further improve-
ment by setting the values of the cut-oﬀ threshold as
a variable depending on the type of contacting residue

Their geometric centers are close enough, but no physical contacts

but a hydrogen bond forms between O from one Lys and N from

assignment in both cases.

Comparison with Other Potentials. We further
compare alpha contact potential with several previ-
ously developed residue contact potentials, includ-
ing MJ [54], BT [55], SK [33], and TD [9] poten-
tials. We take the values of MJ potential from Ta-
ble 3 of reference [54]. Following the author’s rec-
ommendation, the average hydrophobicity (err = -
2.55) was subtracted from the potential, and a pair
of residues is declared to be in contact if the geomet-
ric centers of their side chain is within an interval of
2.0 ˚A to 6.5 ˚A. The values of BT potential is taken
from [55] and was obtained by rescaling MJ potentials
with Thr as the reference solvent [55]. The correla-
tion coeﬃcients ρ and dispersions [55] between each
pair of potentials are shown in table Table VV. The
correlation coeﬃcients ρ for alpha contact potential
log P (i, j) and these residue contact potentials are:
ρ = 0.66, 0.80, 0.61, and 0.66 for MJ, BT, SK, and
TD potentials, respectively. The dispersion as de-
ﬁned in [55] (p.363, Formula 4) are 1.45, 0.28, 0.51,
and 0.39, respectively. Because the contact map ob-
tained by alpha edges can be substantially diﬀerent
from other contact deﬁnition (Fig 4), the absolute
value of energy by alpha contact potential and by
other potentials for the same structure can be sub-
stantially diﬀerent.

Long Range Interactions.
Interactions between
residues with large sequence distance d are relatively
rare. We found that they occur more likely in the
interior of a protein than on the surface (data not
shown). Identifying such interactions are of particu-
lar interest, because these interactions result in sig-
niﬁcant reduction of conformational entropy. Pre-
diction of protein structures seem to be most diﬃ-
cult for those with large contact order [56], namely,
those with signiﬁcant amount of interactions between
residues with large sequence distances.

The bootstrap procedure introduced here provides
a method to reliably identify the contact pairs of
long sequence separation whose propensity values can
be conﬁdently assessed (see Supplementary Online
Material for tables of alpha contact potential for
d ≥ 30). Among all possible 210 pairwise interac-
tions, 9 contact pairs with high propensity (lower
value of 95% conﬁdence interval > 1.5) can be reli-
ably assessed for d > 30. In addition to Cys-Cys, they
include hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions (Gly-
Gly, Met-Met, Ile-Ile, Phe-Phe, Val-Val, Met-Phe),
salt-bridge interactions (Arg-Asp, Asp-Lys), and Pro-
Trp.

Some long range interactions are clearly associ-
ated with speciﬁc secondary structures. After cor-
rection for prior probability to be in a particular
secondary structure, we found that Met-Met con-
tact has a high propensity to occur between two he-
lices (h) or two beta-strands (s) (P (M et, M et)hh =
2.4, P (M et, M et)ss = 2.3), and a low propen-
sity to occur between either a helix and a coil
(c) (P (M et, M et)hc = 0.65), or a strand and a
coil (P (M et, M et)sc = 0.56).
Similarly, because
Gly is a helix breaker, long-range Gly-Gly contact
has a high propensity to occur between two coils
(P (Gly, Gly)cc = 3.2), and low propensity to occur
between two helices (P (Gly, Gly)hh = 0.53).

Reduced Alphabet for Amino Acid Residues.
The clustering of pairwise alpha contact potentials
shown in Figure 2 suggests that many residues be-
have similarly in contact interactions. This points
to possible degeneracy of the amino acid alphabet
[16, 17]. Reduced alphabet is important because a
smaller size of alphabet will lead to exponentially
more eﬃcient sampling methods in sequence design
and protein engineering [57–61]. Many experimental
and computational studies already suggested that a
minimum number of amino acid residue types far less
than 20 may be adequate for protein folding [40, 62–

64]. Wang and Wang examined diﬀerent ways to re-
duced MJ interaction matrix and concluded that by
minimizing mismatches, a reduced alphabet of just
ﬁve amino acid residue types can be used to construct
sequences with good foldability and kinetic accessi-
bility [65]. The reduced 5 alphabet set coincide with
the same alphabet set reported in the work of Rid-
dle et al, where fully functional constructs for a small
57-residue beta-barrel protein can be experimentally
obtained when residues in 38 out of 40 selected amino
residues are drawn from the alphabet set of I, K, E,
A, and G. Murphy et al further examined reduced
alphabets based on BLOSUM50 substitution matrix
[41]. When using a variety of reduced alphabets with
size ranging from 10 to 20, they found that there is
little loss of the information necessary to select struc-
tural homologs in a database of representative protein
sequences using dynamic programming based global
alignment.

We continue investigation in this direction and
study the capability of various reduced alphabet sets
in discriminating native proteins from decoys. Fig 2
provides a natural way of reducing the residue al-
phabet set that is similar to the approach used by
Murphy et al [41]. By placing a horizontal line at
diﬀerent vertical heights, we can obtain a reduced
residue alphabet that is determined by the heights
of the branching points in the dendrogram from the
hierarchical clustering. For example, we can have
an alphabet of 7 residue types at height about 1.5:
A = {D,E}, B = {R,K}, C= {S,T, N, Q, H, P},
D = {V, I, L, M, F, W}, E = {W, Y}, F = {A,
G}, and G = {C}. An alphabet of two residue types
would take Cys as a residue type, and everything else
grouped into another residue type. An alphabet of
three residue types would have Cys, polar residues,
and hydrophobic residues.

tials derived from diﬀerent alphabet sets. The aver-
age RMSDs of n decoys with lowest energy by poten-
tials of diﬀerent alphabets are calculated. Smaller av-
erage RMSD of these lowest energy decoys indicates
that a large fraction of them are near-native struc-
tures. This would suggest good discrimination. The
top n = 100 decoys of lowest energy are all found to
have very similar average RMSD to the native struc-
ture, regardless the size of the alphabet. This sug-
gests that alphabet with just a few residues have re-
spectable results in decoy discrimination. Table VIVI
further shows the correlation coeﬃcient of energy and
RMSD for all proteins in the Park and Levitt data set
when using diﬀerent alphabets. The results indicate
that an alphabet of 7 residues would have very sim-
ilar performance as an alphabet with 20 residues in
discriminating decoys. Our results extended earlier
work where subjectively deﬁned alphabet sets were
used to extract contact residue potentials by an iter-
ative optimization method [9]. It was found that po-
tential derived using such reduced alphabets were ef-
fective in discriminating decoys generated by gapless
threading. Here we showed that similar conclusion
can be drawn for statistical potential using alphabet
sets derived from natural clustering of residues, in dis-
criminating natives against more stringent compact
decoy conformations generated by oﬀ-lattice model
[43]. Our conclusion is also consistent with a recent
study where it is shown that much of the informa-
tion in pairwise contact potential is related to just
a few variables such as hydropathy, charge, disulﬁde
bonding, and residue burial [66].

Although the alphabets we used have diﬀerent
number of residues, they are all developed with one

aspect in common, i.e., the contacts are all derived
from the dual simplicial complexes, which provides
a faithful representation of the geometry. This sug-
gests that as long as the same space ﬁlling pattern is
conserved, the speciﬁc residue types are not critical
in many cases. It seems that packing geometry plays
a very important role, but the speciﬁc residue types
are often replaceable. This observation is consistent
with experimental results where it is well known that
proteins are robust against many mutations.

Edge Simplices and Tetrahedron Simplices.
Pairwise alpha contact potential only considers the
edge simplices or 1-simplices in the dual simplicial
complex. There have been several studies of sta-
tistical potential based on 3-simplices or tetrahedra
In the work of Tropsha et al, 3-simplices
[67–69].
are obtained from unweighted Delaunay triangulation
[67, 68]. In these studies, all residues are treated as
balls of equal size located at Cα or Cβ positions, and
a cut-oﬀ distance is used to remove tetrahedra that
are considered to be too large. Our approach is dif-
ferent. Our model is instead based on the weighted
dual simplicial complex, a diﬀerent simplicial com-
plex formed by a subset of the simplices from the
weighted Delaunay triangulation of all atoms in the
molecule. The dual simplicial complex or the alpha
shape allows modeling at atomic level. Therefore, in
our approach contacts can be deﬁned by the full side
chain and main chain atoms. Additionally, atoms
are assigned with appropriate non-uniform van der
Waals radii [31]. Finally, because the dual simpli-
cial complex reﬂects the precise contact geometry, we
avoid the use of heuristic cut-oﬀ thresholds necessary

Decoys Ranked by Energy

coys using diﬀerent alphabets. For each alphabet, we rank
the decoys by their energy. The average RMSD to the native
structure is then calculated for the top n decoys at diﬀerent
n values. Top dashed line represents the average RMSD if
the decoys are chosen randomly; Dotted line represents the
ideal case that n decoys with smallest RMSD are chosen

to eliminate a subset of the simplices from the De-
launay triangulation. Our contacts represents accu-
rately geometry of the structure. We discussed earlier
the diﬀerences between the alpha contact and contact
by distance cut-oﬀ between geometric centers of side
chains. It is conceivable that similar diﬀerence will
result between alpha contact and the approach de-
scribed in [67, 68].

Summary.
In this work, we introduced a novel rep-
resentation of protein structures using edge simplices
of the alpha shape, or the dual simplicial complex of
the protein structure. By describing pairwise contact
interactions with simplicial edges, we developed alpha
contact potential based on the statistics of edge sim-
plices. We also developed a bootstrap model which
provides conﬁdence interval estimations,
including
those of long range interactions. We found that alpha
contact potential performs well in decoy structure dis-
crimination. By comparing with alternative contact
potential, we conclude that geometric representation
of contact interaction is important, but the speciﬁc
residue types are often interchangeable.

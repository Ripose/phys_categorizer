Close contact ﬂuctuations: the seeding of signalling domains in the immunological
synapse

Amit K Chattopadhyay and Nigel J Burroughs
Mathematics Insitute, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK

We analyse the size and density of thermally induced regions of close contact in cell:cell contact
interfaces within a harmonic potential approximation, estimating these regions to be below 1/10 th
of a micron across. Our calculations indicate that as the distance between the close contact
threshold depth and the mean membrane-membrane separation increases, the density of close
contact patches decreases exponentially while there is only a minimal variation in their mean size.
The technique developed can be used to calculate the probability of ﬁrst crossing in reﬂection
symmetry violating systems.

Surface contact between cells is a key mechanism for in-
formation transfer in many biological systems. These
can be both long term or permanent connections as in
the neurological synapse, or as discovered more recently,
transient and highly dynamic as in the immunological
synapse [1]. T-cells (a class of lymphocytes) make tran-
sient contact with ’target’ cells whilst scanning for the
presence of their speciﬁc antigen, antigen recognition re-
sulting in the stabilisation of the contact and genera-
tion of a macroscopic receptor patternation in the con-
tact interface, or a so called immunological synapse [1].
A fundamental observation is that the contact interface
is heterogeneous, both in the physical separation of the
two cell surfaces [2] and in the local signalling proper-
ties [1, 3, 4]. Diﬀerences in the extracellular lengths of
key molecules/bonds is believed to underpin both these
processes with a predominant division between short and
long bond length molecular species. Of note is that es-
sential antigen signalling receptors, such as the T-cell re-
ceptor (TCR), are small molecules with a ligand-receptor
bond length of 14nm (membrane to membrane span) [1],
while an essential phosphatase (CD45), a major compo-
nent of the glycocalyx, has a length of 25-40nm and is
not believed to have a natural ligand. T cell signalling,
or antigen detection, thus requires tight cell:cell contact
to allow TCR binding, whilst such regions necessarily
require the spatial exclusion of the large molecules com-
prising the glycocalyx. Spatial heterogeneity in the mem-
brane proﬁle within the contact interface is therefore es-
sential for the functioning of the cell contact. Early pat-
terns (50sec) in cell interfaces show random small clusters
of TCRs [3, 4], regions where signalling intermediaries
appear to congregate. These regions of close contact are
presumably formed from ﬂuctuations in the initial con-
tact surfaces. At later times signalling appears to be
focused in distinct stable microclusters [5]. This depen-
dence of signalling on spatial heterogeneity introduces a
key ’exposure’ problem; ligand detection requires that re-
gions of close contact comprise a signiﬁcant area within
the interface while they must be suﬃciently large that

they can be stabilised when segregation is energetically
favourable [6]. We examine the spatial statistics of these
regions of close contact using a linear stochastic model
for thermal ﬂuctuations of the membrane separation.

In this letter, our interest is in the size and den-
sity of regions of close contact (eg membrane-membrane
separation <20 nm) where eﬀective TCR ligand bind-
ing can occur. We utilise a linearised version of the
synapse reaction-diﬀusion equations [6, 7] to model pre
pattern dynamics, reducing to a single equation for the
membrane-membrane separation Z around a mean sepa-
ration (25-50nm) determined by the glycocalyx potential
and receptor-ligand bond equilibrium. In this regime, the
ﬂuctuation Z(~x, t) has dynamics

size of these close contact patches. A point to note is
the symmetry violation of the system around Z =

proximations capture the contrasting weak decline of the
width < X+ >, and strong decay of the hump density
ρhumps with ∆ in Figs. 2 & 3. In 1D, regions with Z > ∆
are always disconnected so the patch density ρhumps can
be deﬁned for all values of ∆. Further, in 1D, there are no
divergences, whilst in higher dimension the divergences
are more severe. These properties result from the inter-
play between the 4th order PDE Eq. 1 and the volume
of phase space.

The probability density function of the distance be-
tween crossings can also be approximated. This utilises
the probability distribution for the number of crossings
of the line Z = ∆, which is computed by generalising the
traditional ’persistence’ analysis [8, 9]. We need to dis-
criminate between the two types of crossings, a crossing
from Z > ∆ to Z < ∆ as x increases, and the con-
verse. Let p+
n (x) denote the probability that an interval
of length x contains n crossings of Z(~x, t) across the refer-
ence level ∆ when Z > ∆ at the extreme left, and p−n (x)

is the corresponding probability with Z < ∆ at the ex-
treme left; in 2D we consider moving a distance x along
a speciﬁed vector. Then under an independent interval

To summmarize, for the harmonic potential membrane
model we have an exact analytic calculation for the mean
size of close contact patches, < X+(∆) >, our calcula-
tions suggesting that these are on the scale of tens of
nm. The scale is primarily determined by the combi-
kBT and has a leading order behaviour
going as 1
∆ for large ∆. This small patch size im-
plies that multiple receptor bindings are unlikely within
a patch and close contact patches are unobservable by
traditional light microscopy. The small size also implies
that phosphatase exclusion (CD45) probably results from
density ﬂuctuations, ie a speciﬁc exclusion mechanism is
not required in contrast to that needed at larger sizes
[6, 7]. The density of patches decays rapidly with the
5.4nm, Eq. (8),
threshold ∆ on a length scale of √c11 ∼
and indicates that cell membranes must be highly ﬂexible
otherwise the glycocalyx would impose too large a barrier
to allow formation of close contact regions (λ increasing
In particular, the glycoca-
with membrane elasticity).
lyx cannot be too deep relative to the size of the TCR
ligand-receptor bond length (14nm) since otherwise the

4

1

density of patches becomes too small for antigen detec-
tion. The probability of T cell signalling depends on the
ability of the TCR to bind it’s ligand and is thus crucially
dependent on the area of close contact regions within
the cell:cell interface which varies as N −
+ , and on the
size of those close contact patches. There is an enhance-
ment in triggering as patch sizes increase above 150nm
[13]; thus our estimates suggest that early signalling re-
lies on patches below this size and enhancement eﬀects
only occur upon aggregation and stabilisation of clusters
as the immunological synapse forms. Such conclusions
are somewhat reminiscent of [12] where formation of a
synapse was related to a critical value of the system pa-
rameters (albeit without evaluating the patch size). We,
however, go beyond such qualitative predictions. Our cal-
culations clearly suggest that the membrane correlation
length is a determining factor in the area of close contact
regions in the interface, which with our parameters limits
the threshold to ∆ < 16 nm.

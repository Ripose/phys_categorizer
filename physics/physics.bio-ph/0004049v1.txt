The macroscopic curvature induced in the double helical
B-DNA by regularly repeated adenine tracts (A-tracts) plays
an exceptional role in structural studies of DNA because this
eﬀect presents the most well-documented example of sequence
speciﬁc conformational modulations. Recently, a new hypoth-
esis of its physical origin has been put forward, based upon the
results of molecular dynamics simulations of a 25-mer frag-
ment with three A-tracts phased with the helical screw. Its
sequence, however, had never been encountered in experimen-
tal studies, but was constructed empirically so as to maximize
the magnitude of bending in speciﬁc computational condi-
tions. Here we report the results of a similar investigation
of another 25-mer B-DNA fragment now with a natural base
pair sequence found in a bent locus of a minicircle DNA. It is
shown that the static curvature of a considerable magnitude
and stable direction towards the minor grooves of A-tracts
emerges spontaneously in conditions excluding any initial bias
except the base pair sequence. Comparison of the bending dy-
namics of these two DNA fragments reveals both qualitative
similarities and interesting diﬀerences. The results suggest
that the A-tract induced bending obtained in simulations re-
produces the natural phenomenon and validates the earlier
conclusions concerning its possible mechanism.

INTRODUCTION

It is now generally accepted that the double helical
DNA can somehow translate its base pair sequence in
tertiary structural forms. The simplest such form is
a bend. Large bends in natural DNA were discovered
nearly twenty years ago for sequences containing regular
repeats of AnTm, with n + m > 3, called A-tracts1
2.
Since then this intriguing phenomenon has been thor-
oughly studied, with several profound reviews of the re-
sults published in diﬀerent years3
8. Every A-tract
slightly deviates the helical axis towards its minor groove,
which results in signiﬁcant macroscopic curvature when
they are repeated in phase with the helical screw. How-
ever, in spite of considerable eﬀorts spent in attempts to
clarify the the physical origin of this phenomenon it still
remains a matter of debate because all theoretical models
proposed until now contradict some of the experimental
results. This problem is of general importance because
the accumulated large volume of apparently paradoxical

observations on the subject points to our lack of under-
standing of the fundamental principles that govern the
DNA structure.

A variety of theoretical methods based upon computer
molecular modeling have been used in order to get in-
sight in the mechanism of DNA bending9
13. The
most valuable are unbiased simulations where sequence
dependent eﬀects result only from lower level interactions
and are not aﬀected by a priori empirical knowledge of
relevant structural features14. Such calculations can re-
veal the essential physical factors and eventually shed
light upon the true mechanism of DNA bending. We
have recently reported about the ﬁrst example of stable
static curvature emerging spontaneously in free molec-
ular dynamics simulations a B-DNA fragment with A-
tracts phased with the helical screw, and proposed a
new mechanism of bending that could explain our re-
sults as well as experimental data15
16. However, the
sequence used in these computational experiments was
artiﬁcial in the sense that it was designed empirically
so as to accelerate the development and maximize the
amplitude of bending. It was never studied experimen-
tally, therefore, even though it was similar to canoni-
cal DNA benders, one could not exclude that the static
bending observed in calculations was of a diﬀerent origin
than that found in experiments. Here we report the re-
sults of a similar study of a complementary 25-mer DNA
duplex AAAATGTCAAAAAATAGGCAAATTT. This
fragment is found in the center of the ﬁrst bent DNA lo-
cus investigated experimentally in vitro1
2. It belongs to
a minicircle DNA from the kinetoplast body of Leishma-
nia tarentolae and, together with several additional A-
tracts, provides planar curvature that apparently serves
in vivo to facilitate the loop closure. We have only re-
placed the 3’-terminal A6 tract in the original fragment2
by A3T3 because our preliminary empirical observations
suggested that 3’-terminal An tracts usually need larger
time to converge to characteristic conformations with a
narrow minor groove.

,

We show that two independent long MD trajectories
starting from straight conformations corresponding to
canonical A and B-DNA forms both converge to stati-
cally bent structures with similar bending direction and
magnitude, thus giving the ﬁrst example of a natural
DNA fragment where this phenomenon is reproduced in
simulations. The results are qualitatively similar to our

1

ﬁrst report16 as regards the kinetics of convergence and
comparison with diﬀerent theoretical models of bending.
At the same time, along with convergence of the overall
macroscopic DNA from, we ﬁnd here a remarkably larger
than earlier degree of convergence in local backbone and
base pair conformations. These results conﬁrm that A-
tract induced DNA bending found in calculations corre-
sponds to the experimental phenomenon. They provide
additional information concerning its mechanism and the
intriguing relationship between the base pair sequence
and the DNA structure.

RESULTS

Two long MD trajectories have been computed for the
complementary
duplex
AAAATGTCAAAAAATAGGCAAATTT. The ﬁrst tra-
jectory referred to below as TJB started from the ﬁber
canonical B-DNA structure and continued to 10 ns. The
second trajectory (TJA) started form the ﬁber canonical
A-DNA conformation and continued to 20 ns. The longer
duration of TJA was necessary to ensure structural con-
vergence. The computational protocols are detailed in
Methods.

Figure 1 shows two series of representative structures
from the two trajectories. Each structure is an average
over a nanosecond interval, with these intervals equally
spaced in time. In TJB the molecule was curved always in
the same direction, but both the shape of the helical axis
and the magnitude of bending varied. The ﬁrst two struc-
tures shown in Fig. 1a are locally bent between the upper
two A-tracts while their lower parts are nearly straight.
In contrast, in the last three structures, the planar curva-
ture is smoothly distributed over the entire molecule. In
TJA, distinguishable stable bending emerged only after
a few nanoseconds, but after the fourth nanosecond all
average conformations were smoothly bent. In contrast
to TJB, however, the bending direction was not stable,
and by comparing the two time series of perpendicular
projections one may see that during the ﬁrst 15 nanosec-
onds the bending plane slowly rotated. During the ﬁnal
ﬁve nanoseconds the overall bending direction was stable.
In the last conformation, an S-shaped proﬁle of the heli-
cal axis is found in the perpendicular projection, which
indicates that there are two slightly misaligned bends lo-
cated between the three A-tracts. The orientations of
the helices in this ﬁgure was chosen separately for the
two trajectories, and one can notice that the left projec-
tion in plate (a) is close to the right one in plate (b),
in other words, the ﬁnal bend directions diﬀered by ap-
proximately 90◦. In TJA, the intersection of the minor
groove with the bending plane occurs close to the center
of the middle A-tract while in TJB this point is shifted
towards its 3’ end. In both cases, however, the narrowed
minor grooves of the A-tracts appear at the inside edge
of the curved axis.

FIG. 1. Consecutive average structures from TJB and
TJA. The average conformations were taken from one
nanosecond intervals equally spaced over the trajectories,
namely, during the second, fourth, sixth nanosecond, and so
forth. They were all superimposed and two perpendicular
views are shown in the ﬁgure. In both trajectories, the view
is chosen according to the ﬁnal orientation of the bending
plane. Namely, a straight line between the ends of the helical
axis passes through its center in the right hand projection.
Residues are coded by colors, namely, A - green, T - red, G -
yellow, C - blue.

FIG. 2. The time evolution of several representative struc-
tural parameters in TJB (a) and TJA (b). Nonhydrogen atom
rmsd is measured with respect to the ﬁber canonical B-DNA
model constructed from the published atom coordinates17.
The bending direction is characterized by the angle (given
in degrees) between the plane that passes through the two
ends and the middle point of the helical axis, and the xz
plane of the local DNA coordinate frame at the center of
the duplex. The local frame is constructed according to the
Cambridge convention18, namely, its x direction points to the
major DNA groove along the short axis of the base-pair, while
the local z axis direction is adjacent to the optimal helicoidal
axis. Thus, a zero angle between the two planes corresponds
to the overall bend to the minor groove exactly at the central
base pair. The bending angle is measured between the two
ends of the helical axis. The shift parameter is the average
deviation of the helical axis from the straight line between its
ends. The shortening is measured as the ratio of the lengths
of the curved axis to its end-to-end distance minus one. All
traces have been smoothed by averaging with a window of 75
ps in (a) and 150 ps in (b).

Figure 2 displays ﬂuctuations of various parameters
that characterize the overall bending of the double he-
lix.
In both trajectories the rmsd from the canonical
B-DNA usually ﬂuctuates between 2 and 4 ˚A and cor-
relates with the three parameters shown in Fig. 2 that
measure the bending magnitude. Note that in TJA there
was a short period of strong initial bending which have
not been detected in Fig. 1. The most signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence between the two plates in Fig. 2 is in the dynamics
of the bending direction. In TJB, the ﬁnal orientation
of the bend was found early and remained quite stable,
although the molecule sometimes straightened giving, si-
multaneously, a low bending magnitude and large tempo-
rary ﬂuctuations of direction. In contrast, during the ﬁrst
15 nanoseconds of TJA, the bending plane made more
than a half turn with respect to the coordinate system
bound to the molecule, that is a transition occurred be-
tween oppositely bent conformations by passing through
a continuous series of bent states. Temporary transi-
tions to the straight state were short-living and always
reversed, with the bending resumed in the previous direc-
tion. Owing to this turn the bend orientations in TJA
and TJB converged considerably although not exactly.
The zero direction in Fig. 2 corresponds to bending to-
wards the minor groove at the ﬁfth AT base pair of the
middle A-tract. We see that, at the end of TJA, it is
shifted from zero by an angle corresponding to rotation
in one base pair step, which gives a bend towards the
minor groove close to the center of the middle A-tract.
In TJB, the direction deviates from zero in the opposite
sense by an angle corresponding to roughly two base pair
steps, resulting in a residual divergence of approximately
90◦ between the two trajectories. The slow kinetics of
convergence exhibited in Fig. 2 indicates, however, that
still better accuracy, if ever possible, would require much
longer time.

FIG. 3. The time evolution of the proﬁle of the minor
groove in TJB (a) and TJA (b). The surfaces are formed
by time-averaged successive minor groove proﬁles, with that
on the front face corresponding to the ﬁnal DNA conforma-
tion. The interval of averaging was 75 ps in TJB and 150 ps
in TJA. The groove width is evaluated by using space traces
of C5’ atoms as described elsewhere19. Its value is given in
angstr¨oms and the corresponding canonical B-DNA level of
7.7 ˚A is marked by the straight dotted lines on the faces of
the box.

FIG. 4. Dynamics of BI ↔ BII transitions in TJB (a) and
TJA (b). The BI and BII conformations are distinguished by
the values of two consecutive backbone torsions, ε and ζ. In a
transition they change concertedly from (t,g−) to (g−,t). The
diﬀerence ζ − ε is, therefore, positive in BI state and nega-
tive in BII, and it is used in as a monitoring indicator, with
the corresponding gray scale levels shown on the right in each
plate. Each base pair step is characterized by a column con-
sisting of two sub-columns, with the left sub-columns referring
to the sequence written at the top in 5’-3’ direction from left
to right. The right sub-columns refer to the complementary
sequence shown at the bottom.

Figure 3 displays the time evolution of the proﬁle of
the minor grooves in TJB and TJA. At the end of both
trajectories the minor groove width exhibits modulations
phased with the helical screw. It is signiﬁcantly widened
between the A-tracts and narrowed within them by ap-
proximately 1 ˚A with respect to the canonical level. This
magnitude of narrowing corresponds well to the values
observed in experimental structures of A-tract contain-
ing B-DNA oligomers20
19. In TJB, the overall
waving proﬁle established early and remained more or
less constant. Interestingly, during two rather long peri-
ods, a secondary minimum occurred close to the 5’ end of
the middle A-tract, and at the same time the main central
minimum sifted towards the 3’ end of this A-tract. These
motions involve almost an entire helical turn and, appar-
ently, are concerted, which demonstrates the possibility
of medium range structural correlations along the dou-
ble helix. Comparison of Figs. 1a and 3a suggests that
there is no simple one-to-one relationship between bend-
ing and minor groove modulations. Notably, the right
smaller and narrower widening corresponds to a stable
and strong bending point of the helical axis, while the
left one, which is evidently larger, gives less or no bend-
ing. In TJA, the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the minor groove
established only during the last few nanoseconds, but the
ﬁnal proﬁle has the same number and similar positions
of local maxima and minima as that in TJB. The overall
minor groove dynamics in TJA looks rather complicated
and its relationship with the quasi-regular rotation of the
bending plane demonstrated in Figs. 1b and 2b is not
readily seen.

,

Figure 4 displays dynamics of BI ↔ BII backbone
transitions in the two trajectories. A few common
features can be noticed that have been encountered
previously15
16. For instance, in A-tracts, the BII con-
formers are commonly found in ApA steps and almost
never in TpT steps. They tend to alternate with BI in
consecutive ApA steps. BI ↔ BII transitions often occur
concertedly along the same strand as well as in oppo-
site strands. The BI ↔ BII dynamics comprises all time
scales presented in these calculations and clearly involves
slower motions as well. Note, for instance, a particularly
stable BII conformer in the only GpA step available in
the two strands. On the other hand, there is some sim-
ilarity in the distributions of the BII conformers in the
two trajectories, which is a new feature compared to our
previous report15
16. It is seen in Fig. 4 that in total ten
BII conformers were found at the end of TJB and eight
in TJA. Among them six and ﬁve, respectively, occurred
in non A-tract sequences. In three base pair steps the BII
conformers are found in both ﬁnal conformations, with
all of them in non A-tract sequences. A careful exam-
ination the two plates in Fig. 4 shows that, although
in A-tracts the preferred sites of BII conformations dif-
fer, in the intervening sequences their dynamics is rather
similar in TJB and TJA. This trend is demonstrated in
Fig. 5 where inter-trajectory correlations are examined
for the speciﬁc base pair step propensities to BI and BII

conformers. We have not included here the TpT steps in
A-tracts because they strongly prefer the BI conforma-
tion and, therefore, are trivially correlated. It is evident
that, except for ApA steps in A-tracts, there was certain
correlation in the average populations of BII conformers
for each speciﬁc base pair step in the two trajectories.
The ApA steps apparently can adopt both conformations
with little eﬀect of the sequence context and the overall
structure.

Figure 6 shows variation of several helicoidal parame-
ters along the duplex in three representative one nanosec-
ond averaged structures. Two of them were taken from
TJA, namely, the 16th and 18th nanosecond averages
which we refer to as TJA16 and TJA18. They illustrate
the scale and the character of ﬂuctuations of these pa-
rameters in the course of the same dynamics. The third
conformation is the last average of TJB (TJB10) and it
illustrates convergence of helical parameters in indepen-
dent trajectories. We have chosen TJA16 and TJA18 be-
cause, as seen in Fig. 1, the corresponding two structures
are particularly similar. They are both smoothly bent in
a virtually identical direction and their rmsd is only 0.95
˚A. All parameters shown in the ﬁgure, except the incli-
nation, exhibit jumping alternations between consecutive
base pair steps. Although they look chaotic, there is a
considerable similarity between TJA16 and TJA18 and
less signiﬁcant, but still evident similarity of the two with
TJB10. Notably, a remarkable correspondence of alter-
ations of the twist is observed in the right-hand half of
the sequence. At the same time, even the TJA16 and
TJA18 plots sometimes diverge. Note, for instance, that
the alteration in their roll traces are phased in the central
A-tract, but dephased in the other two, with a particu-
larly signiﬁcant diﬀerence around the TpA step. These
results show that, in a statically curved double helix, the

FIG. 6. Sequence variations of some helicoidal parameters
in representative one nanosecond averaged structures from
TJB and TJA. The sequence of the ﬁrst strand is shown on
the top in 5’ – 3’ direction. The complementary sequence of
the second strand is written on the bottom in the opposite
direction. All parameters were evaluated with the Curves
program25 and are given in degrees. The color coding is:
TJA 18th ns – red, TJA 16th ns – green and TJB 10th ns –

base pair helicoidal parameters ﬂuctuate around certain
speciﬁc values that are stable in the nanosecond time
scale. There is, however, more than one combination of
these parameters for the same overall bend. At the same
time, the evident convergence of the corresponding dis-
tributions in TJA and TJB suggests that, at least for
this particular base pair sequence, the number of such
redundant combinations should not be very large.

Discussion

The computational experiments described here give
the ﬁrst example of a natural DNA fragment with phased
A-tracts which in free unbiased MD simulations adopts
spontaneously a statically bent shape. In the analogous
earlier calculations the static curvature has been demon-
strated for a diﬀerent A-tract containing sequence con-
structed artiﬁcally and never tested in experiments15
16.
The qualitative similarity between these two simulations

,

6

is evident. Trajectories starting from canonical A and
B-DNA forms both travel within the B-DNA family and,
in straight, states yield rmsd from B-DNA of around 2
˚A. TJA enters the B-DNA family with a signiﬁcant tem-
porary bending during the ﬁrst 500 ps. Later it becomes
bent in an arbitrary direction and next changes the bend
direction by slowly rotating the bending plane. This ro-
tation slows down after 10 ns, with the ﬁnal orientation
much closer to that in TJB than the initial one. In both
cases the residual discrepancy was in the range of 60◦ –
90◦16. The ﬁnal minor groove proﬁles are not identical,
although similar for TJA and TJB, as well as the distri-
butions of the BI and BII backbone conformers and base
pair helicoidal parameters. The present results, there-
fore, suggest that the A-tract induced DNA bending ob-
served in calculations here and before corresponds to the
experimental phenomenon.

,

At the same time, there are several clear diﬀerences.
Notably, the preferred bending direction here is closer the
centers of the minor grooves of the A-tracts, whereas the
magnitude of bending is somewhat less than in the previ-
ous calculations. The bending angle in the average struc-
tures shown in Fig. 1 ﬂuctuates between 12◦ and 25◦ in
TJB and between 7◦ and 28◦ in TJA, with the maximal
values reached at the end in both cases. The previous ar-
tiﬁcal sequence was constructed to maximize the bending
and it showed the corresponding values beyond 35◦15
16.
According to the experimental estimates made for “good
benders” in an optimal sequence context, the magnitude
of bending is around 18◦ per A-tract8, which in our case
gives 36◦ for the overall bend because the principal bend-
ing elements are the two intervening zones between the
A-tracts. The bends observed here are somewhat be-
low this estimate. However, in experiments, the bending
magnitude diﬀers signiﬁcantly between diﬀerent A-tract
sequences and depends upon many environmental param-
eters that are not controlled in simulations. One can ex-
pect to observe in calculations sequence variations of the
bending magnitude that may not exactly follow those in
experiments. Therefore, whatever the possible reasons
of the apparent discrepancy, the overall correspondence
of the computed bending magnitudes to the experimen-
tal estimates should be considered as surprisingly good.
Yet another diﬀerence is a larger than earlier degree of
similarity in the proﬁles of the minor groove, in the dis-
tributions of BII conformers, and helicoidal parameters
in trajectories starting from A and B-DNA forms. It was
the most surprising observation of our previous report
that reasonably good convergence in terms of the macro-
scopic bent shape of the double helix was not accompa-
nied by the parallel convergence of microscopic confor-
mational parameters. Here the two trajectories manifest
clear signs of convergence for base pair step parameters
as well as for the backbone conformations. Additional
studies are necessary in order to tell if this diﬀerence is
a sequence speciﬁc property or just an occasional eﬀect.
In spite of these diﬀerences the results presented here
support our previous conclusion concerning the qualita-

tive disagreement of the computed structural dynamics
of the double helix and the most popular earlier theories
of bending16.
In Figs. 3, 4, and 6, multiple examples
are found of strong variability of local helical parame-
ters in bent substates, which argues against the local
interactions and the preferred base pair orientations as
the cause of bending. All three A-tracts are character-
ized by a narrowed minor groove and local minima in the
traces of the propeller twist and the inclination of base
pairs. Nevertheless, their internal structures are not ho-
mogeneous and vary from one base pair step to another.
Moreover, the structures of the three are not the same
and present another example of an ensemble of confor-
mational substates with a common overall shape. This
pattern is qualitatively diﬀerent from that implied by the
junction models of bending26
27. At the same time, the
present results are well interpreted in the framework of
our model that sees the principal cause of the bending
in the backbone stiﬀness and the postulated excess of its
speciﬁc length over that in the idealized regular B-DNA
double helix16. Several non trivial observations support
this view.

,

The ﬁrst observation is the microheterogeneity of the
ensemble of conformations that provide the same bent
form of the double helix during the last nanoseconds of
both trajectories. Once the backbone have found its pre-
ferred waving shape on the surface of the B-DNA cylin-
der it ﬁxes the bending direction. The thermal motion
of bases is allowed, but they are forced to respect this
mechanical constraint, giving rise to an ensemble of con-
formations with diﬀerent base orientations, but the same
bent form of the double helix

The second observation is an always waving minor
groove proﬁle which does not change during temporary
short-living straightening. The waving proﬁle is the di-
rect consequence of the postulated excess of the speciﬁc
backbone length over that in the regular B-DNA with
even grooves. The main immediate cause of bending
is the necessity to compress the backbone in the minor
groove widenings if the parallel base pair stacking is to
be preserved16. The backbone stiﬀness tends to cause
destacking from the minor groove side, which results in
bending towards the major groove. Symmetrical destack-
ing is also possible, however, and transitions between var-
ious types of stacking perturbations makes possible time
variations of the magnitude of bending with a constant
backbone proﬁle.

Finally, our model explains well the persistent bends
in incorrect directions and the rotation of the bending
plane observed in TJA. According to this view the exces-
sive backbone length and its stiﬀness force the backbone
to wander on the surface of the B-DNA cylinder what-
ever the base pair sequence is.
In the dynamics start-
ing from the A-DNA structure the duplex enters the B-
DNA family in strongly non-equilibrium conditions, with
rapidly changing diﬀerent energy components. The back-
bone quickly extends to its preferred speciﬁc length tak-
ing some waving proﬁle and causing bending in an ar-

bitrary direction. During the subsequent slow evolution
it remains always waving, and that is why there is al-
ways a preferred bend direction which is not lost during
occasional straightening.

Methods

,

As in the previous report16, the molecular dynamics
simulations were carried out with the internal coordinate
method (ICMD)28
29. The minimal model of B-DNA was
used, with ﬁxed all bond length, rigid bases, ﬁxed va-
lence angles except those centered at sugar atoms and
increased eﬀective inertia of hydrogen-only rigid bodies
as well as planar sugar angles30
16. The time step was
10 fsec. AMBER9431
32 force ﬁeld and atom parameters
were used with TIP3P water33 and no cut oﬀ schemes.
The heating and equilibration protocols were same as
before30
34. The Berendsen algorithm35 was applied dur-
ing the production run, with a relaxation time of 10 ps,
to keep the temperature close to 300 K. The coordinates
were saved once in 2.5 ps.

,

,

,

The initial conformation for TJB was prepared by
vacuum energy minimization starting from the ﬁber
B-DNA model constructed from the published atom
coordinates17.
375 water molecules were next added
by the hydration protocol designed to ﬁll up the minor
groove30. The initial conformation for TJA was prepared
by hydrating the minor groove of the corresponding A-
DNA model17 without preliminary energy minimization.
The necessary number of water molecules was added af-
ter equilibration to make it equal in TJA and TJB.

During the runs, after every 200 ps, water positions
were checked in order to identify those penetrating into
the major groove and those completely separated. These
molecules, if found, were removed and next re-introduced
in simulations by putting them with zero velocities at
random positions around the hydrated duplex, so that
they could readily re-join the core system. This time
interval was chosen so as to ensure a small enough average
number of repositioned molecules which was ca 1.5.

1. First referee

These companion manuscripts describe a series of
molecular dynamics trajectories obtained for DNA se-
quences containing arrangements of oligo dA - oligo dT
motifs implicated in intrinsic DNA bending. Unlike pre-
vious MD studies of intrinsically bent DNA sequences,
these calculations omit explicit consideration of the role
of counterions. Because recent crystallographic studies
of A-tract-like DNA sequences have attributed intrinsic
bending to the localization of counterions in the minor
groove, a detailed understanding of the underlying ba-
sis of A-tract-dependent bending and its relationship to
DNA-counterion interactions would be an important con-
tribution.

Although the MD calculations seem to have been car-
ried out with close attention to detail, both manuscripts
suﬀer from some troubling problems, speciﬁcally:

The sequence investigated here is a 25-bp segment
of the well-characterized L. tarentolae kinetoplast-DNA
bending locus. Two trajectories, TJA and TJB, were
computed starting from canonical A-form and B-form
structures, respectively. Although the author argues that
greater structural convergence between TJA and TJB
has taken place in these simulations, there is still a sig-
niﬁcant disparity concerning the observed bending direc-
tions in these two structures. Moreover, the extent of
bending in this simulated helix is signiﬁcantly less than
that observed in the previous study, which is unexpected
because of out-of-phase placement of the third A tract
in the previous sequence. This behavior is not explained
and seems diﬃcult to rationalize.

Abstract. In competition experiments between two RNA viruses of
equal or almost equal ﬁtness, often both strains gain in ﬁtness before
one eventually excludes the other. This observation has been linked to
the Red Queen eﬀect, which describes a situation in which organisms
have to constantly adapt just to keep their status quo. I carried out ex-
periments with digital organisms (self-replicating computer programs)
in order to clarify how the competing strains’ location in ﬁtness space
inﬂuences the Red-Queen eﬀect. I found that gains in ﬁtness during com-
petition were prevalent for organisms that were taken from the base of
a ﬁtness peak, but absent or rare for organisms that were taken from
the top of a peak or from a considerable distance away from the nearest
peak. In the latter two cases, either neutral drift and loss of the ﬁttest
mutants or the waiting time to the ﬁrst beneﬁcial mutation were more
important factors. Moreover, I found that the Red-Queen dynamic in
general led to faster exclusion than the other two mechanisms.

1 Introduction

Two major principles of evolutionary biology have been observed in competition
experiments between variants of RNA viruses with identical or almost identical
ﬁtness: competitive exclusion and Red Queen dynamic [1,2]. The competitive
exclusion principle refers to the ultimate outcome of these competition exper-
iments, and states that when two or more species live on the same resource,
eventually all but one will die out [3]. The Red Queen dynamic refers to the
initial phase of these competition experiments, where the two competing virus
variants both increase in ﬁtness while they remain in roughly equal concen-
trations. Van Valen [4] had originally proposed the Red Queen dynamic as a
metaphor for the struggle for existence of species in complex ecosystems. These
species, just like the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass,
would constantly have to run (that is, to adapt to changing conditions) just to
remain where they were (see also Ref. [5]).

Sol´e et al. [6] studied the competition of neutral virus variants in a sim-
ple bitstring model with additive ﬁtness, related to Kauﬀman’s N K model [7],
and could conﬁrm both competitive exclusion and Red Queen dynamic in their

model. Moreover, Sol´e et al. showed that the competitive exclusion principle
follows immediately from the quasispecies equations [8,9] that describe virus
evolution.

The Red Queen eﬀect, on the other hand, is not a necessary conclusion of the
quasispecies dynamic, as we can see from a simple thought experiment: Assume
that we allow two viruses to compete that are both situated on top of the highest
peak in the ﬁtness landscape. None of the two viruses can accumulate any further
beneﬁcial mutations, and the outcome of a competition between them will be
determined by genetic drift. Clearly, the Red Queen dynamic can occur only if
beneﬁcial mutations are suﬃciently abundant, so that adaptation happens on a
faster time scale than genetic drift. The additive model of Sol´e et al. has a fairly
high rate of positive mutations for all but the very best sequences in the ﬁtness
landscape, which explains why they observed the Red Queen dynamic. Such
simple additive or multiplicative ﬁtness landscapes lead to a smooth increase in
average ﬁtness over time [10,11], and such increase has been reported for RNA
viruses [12]. However, in many cases beneﬁcial mutations are rare, which leads
to the frequently-oberseved stepwise increase in average ﬁtness [13,14,15,16].

Here, I present a study of the inﬂuence of the immediate neighborhood in
the ﬁtness space on the competition dynamics of identical organisms. I carried
out this study with digital organisms (self-replicating computer programs) [17],
using the Avida platform. Avida is similar to Tom Ray’s Tierra [18], and has
been described extensively in the literature [19,20,21,22]. In Avida, the self-
replicating computer programs are rewarded with increased CPU speed when
they perform certain logical computations. By changing the bonus structure,
that is, by changing which computations are rewarded with what bonuses, the
researcher can shape the ﬁtness landscape in which the digital organisms evolve.
I studied three diﬀerent strains of digital organisms that were located on the top
(A), at the base (B), and some distance away from the nearest ﬁtness peak (C)
(Fig. 1).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Computer experiments

I used Avida version 1.99, which is available from http://sourceforge.net/
projects/avida. I used the default setup, apart from the following modiﬁca-
tions: I switched oﬀ length changes, and set insertion and deletion mutations to
zero. As the original ancestor of all organisms in this study, I used the handwrit-
ten organism organism.heads.100, which comes with the Avida distribution.
I used two diﬀerent environment ﬁles (the environment determines the logical
operations for which organisms are rewarded, and thus deﬁnes the ﬁtness land-
scape). The ﬁrst one, environment 1, did not reward any logical computations,
so that ﬁtness was a direct function of an organism’s replication eﬃciency. The
second one, environment 2, rewarded all possible one-, two-, and three-input
logical operations. In this environment, replication eﬃciency was only a minor

used in this study. Strain A was taken from the top of a ﬁtness peak, strain
B from the base of a ﬁtness peak, and strain C from some distance away from
the nearest ﬁtness peak. For simplicity of illustration, this ﬁgure shows only one
ﬁtness peak, whereas in reality the ﬁtness peak of strain A was diﬀerent from
the one of strains B and C.

component of ﬁtness, whereas the successful completion of as many logical com-
putations as possible resulted in high ﬁtness values. The mutation rate in all
experiments was 0.75 miscopied instructions per oﬀspring organism, unless ex-
plicitly stated otherwise.

I created the strains A, B, and C (as illustrated in Fig. 1) as follows. For strain
A, I inocculated a population of N = 5000 organisms with the handwritten an-
cestor, and propagated this population for 14,000 generations in environment 1.
Then, I extracted the most abundant organism, which replicated roughly two
times faster than the original ancestor. By generation 14,000, the population
had not experienced any signiﬁcant ﬁtness improvements for over 10,000 gener-
ations, which showed that it had indeed reached the top of a ﬁtness peak. For
strain B, I ﬁrst evolved from the handwritten ancestor an organism that could
perform all possible one- and two-input logical computations. Then, I inoccu-
lated a population of size N = 200 with this evolved organism, in order to let
the organism accumulate mutations. After 50 generations, I extracted from the
population a variant with drastically reduced (by a factor of ﬁfteen) ﬁtness. This
variant diﬀered in six instructions (out of 100) from its evolved ancestor, and
had lost ﬁve logical operations. It was therefore at the base of a ﬁtness peak in

environment 2, where many additional logical computations could be learned.
For strain C, I simply used the handwritten ancestor (also in environment 2).
The handwritten ancestor did not perform any logical computations. In Avida,
the evolution of the ﬁrst logical computation is harder than the evolution of ad-
ditional ones, which guaranteed that C was further away from the ﬁtness peak
than B.

I carried out all competition experiments with the following protocol. For
each strain, I used three diﬀerent population sizes, N = 100, N = 1000, and
N = 10, 000. I did 100 replicates per population size and competing strain.
In each competition experiment, I inocculated the population with N identical
copies of the strain under study, and marked half of them with an inheritable
neutral marker. Then, I propagated the population in the respective environment
(environment 1 for strain A, environment 2 for strains B and C) at ﬁxed size N
until the population consisted of either all marked or all unmarked organisms.
Each generation, I recorded the average and maximum ﬁtness of the marked and
unmarked organisms, as well as their relative frequencies.

2.2 Coalescent theory

For the competition of two strains in a completely ﬂat landscape, we can calculate
the distribution of extinction times from coalescent theory. Let pj(t) be the
probability that after t generations, each of the N organisms in the population
is a direct descendant of one of a group of only j organisms that were present
at t = 0. Further, let mj = [1 − (1/2)j−1] be the probability that this group of
j contained both marked and unmarked organisms. Then, the probability that
neither the marked nor the unmarked strain is extinct after t generations is

The quantity pj(t) has been given in various forms in the literature [23,24,25].
The following version is based on the result by Tavar´e [25]:

P (textinct > t) =

mjpj(t) .

where ρk(t) = exp[−k(k − 1)tσ2/(2N )], and Cjk satisﬁes the recursion (for k ≥
j):

The quantity σ2 is the variance of the oﬀspring distribution. In Avida, it has
the value σ2 = 2/3, because organisms in Avida can have either zero, one, or
two oﬀspring organisms per generation, with equal probabilities (if all organisms
have equal ﬁtness).

3 Results and Discussion

I measured the time to extinction of the losing clone in all competition experi-
ments and derived the distributions of extinction times. The nine distributions
(three strains at three diﬀerent population sizes) are shown in Fig. 2. The ex-
tinction times are the longest for competitions of strain A, intermediate for com-
petitions of strain C, and shortest for competitions of strain B. For strains A
and B, the extinction times grow systematically with increasing population size,
whereas for strain C, the extinction times grow from N = 100 to N = 1000, but
then decrease again for N = 10, 000. (Notice that the line with solid diamonds
lies on the left of the line with solid squares in Fig. 2b.)

Typical competition dynamics for the three strains are displayed in Figs. 3-5.
In all three ﬁgures, I show the average and maximum ﬁtness of the winning and
the losing clone as a function of time, as well as the relative concentration of the
winning clone as a function of time.

For strain A, average and maximum ﬁtness of the two competing clones re-
mained typically almost unchanged until the losing clone disappeared (Fig. 3).

Fig. 2. Distributions of extinction times for all three strains and all three popu-
lation sizes. I plot the cummulative frequency of all extinction times larger than
or equal to the given generation, P (textinct > t). Part a shows also the prediction
for neutral evolution according to Eq. (1).

Changes in relative clone size were mostly due to genetic drift. However, the
theoretical prediction Eq. (1) works only moderately well for the smallest popu-
lation size, and overestimates the extinction times for the larger population sizes
substantially (Fig. 2). I veriﬁed that this eﬀect is not a shortcomming of the
theoretical prediction by carrying out additional competition experiments with
all mutations switched oﬀ (data not shown). For these experiments, the extinc-
tion data were in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction, which
implies that the reduced extinction times in the competitions with mutations
must be due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Indeed, in Fig. 3, we
see that the maximum ﬁtness of the losing clone is—after approximately 500
generations—consistently lower than the maximum ﬁtness of the winning clone.
Even though the diﬀerence in maximum ﬁtness between the two clones is very
small, it is suﬃcient to accelerate the extinction process. And the smaller the
losing clone becomes, the more likely it is to experience even further reductions
in its maximum ﬁtness. The ﬁnal stage of the competition is mutational melt-
down [26]: Decreasing clone size accelerates loss of the highest ﬁtness mutants,
which in turn results in even further reduction of clone size. The clone decreases
in size and loses ﬁtness at an ever accelerating pace, until it has disappeared.

Fig. 3 clearly shows that mutational meltdown takes place towards the end
of the competition and leads to a reduced extinction time. At ﬁrst glance it is
surprising that mutational meltdown should be responsible for the increasing
deviations between theory and measured extinction times as the population size

increases. After all, mutational meltdown is commonly associated with small
population sizes. The reason why this eﬀect here becomes more pronounced at
larger population sizes is the following: When the relative diﬀerence in ﬁtness be-
tween two mutants is smaller than the inverse of the population size, then these
two mutants are eﬀectively neutral, in the sense that they are equally aﬀected
by genetic drift. Therefore, larger population sizes can resolve ﬁner ﬁtness diﬀer-
ences between mutants. In the case of strain A, the ﬁtness diﬀerence between the
winning and the losing clone is miniscule, so that at small population sizes, drift
is the dominant factor. Once the population size is suﬃciently large, however,
this small ﬁtness diﬀerence turns the population dynamic deterministic, and the
clone that loses the ﬁttest mutant ﬁrst will slowly but surely disappear.

A competition between two clones of strain C typically started out just like
one between two clones of strain A. However, often one of the two clones managed
eventually to acquire a beneﬁcial mutation with substantial selective advantage,
and would then quickly exclude the other clone. Since beneﬁcial mutations were
fairly rare for strain A, the second clone did not have the chance to pick up an
even better mutation in the short time that remained before it died out. Clearly,
the time to the ﬁrst beneﬁcial mutation determined therefore the distribution of
extinction times, unless it was much larger than the typical time to extinction
by genetic drift. The time to the ﬁrst beneﬁcial mutation grows with decreasing
population size, while the time to extinction by drift grows with increasing pop-
ulation size. The distributions of extinction times for strain C are determined
by these two constraints: For N = 100, beneﬁcial mutations are very rare, and
the extinction times are dominated by the eﬀects of drift. For N = 1000, ben-
eﬁcial mutations are still rare, but nevertheless suﬃciently abundant, so that
the extinction times are clearly shorter than the ones for drift alone. Finally, for
N = 10, 000, beneﬁcial mutations are so frequent that the time to extinction is
on average even shorter than for N = 1000.

Strain B showed a competition dynamic very similar to the one described by
Sol´e et al. [6]. Both the marked and the unmarked clone gained substantially in
ﬁtness during the competition, and both clones would alternatingly take the lead
in ﬁtness gains (Fig. 5). However, this Red-Queen dynamic came at a price: The
time to extinction of either clone was consistently shorter than for strains A or C.
Apparently, the constantly changing relative growth rates of the two competing
clones introduced increased ﬂuctuations in the clone sizes, so that one of the
clones was quickly reduced to a size at which it became prone to mutational
meltdown, or was at least substantially impaired in its ability to acquire further
beneﬁcial mutations.

4 Conclusions

The location in ﬁtness space from where a strain is taken has a strong inﬂuence
on its competition dynamic. A clear arms race of mutants with ever increasing
ﬁtness can only be observed when beneﬁcial mutations are abundant. When ben-
eﬁcial mutations are rare or completely absent, then either the clone that ﬁnds

a beneﬁcial mutation ﬁrst wins or the clone that loses the highest-ﬁtness mutant
ﬁrst loses. In general, it seems that a positive mutation rate will always reduce
the competition time, so that the loser dies out earlier than it would in the ab-
sence of mutations. The Red-Queen dynamic, where both clones acquire mutants
of ever increasing ﬁtness, is particularly unstable. In this case, competitions last
the shortest.

The results that I have presented here were obtained in computer experiments
with digital organisms. Therefore, it is not a priori clear that my conclusions ap-
ply directly to RNA viruses. Nevertheless, I believe it is very likely that they
do. In particular, the way in which RNA virus strains are typically prepared
for competition experiments (frequent transfers at small population sizes, which
leads to accumulation of deleterious mutations, and transfers to new environ-
ments, where many advantageous mutations can be acquired) are similar to my
preparation of strain B. The fact that they show competition dynamics very sim-
ilar to that of strain B is therefore reassuring. To test my other predictions in
a virus system, one would need strains similar to A or C. In principle, it should
be possible to prepare a virus strain which is located at or near the top of a
ﬁtness peak, by propagating the virus for a long time in a constant environment
at a large eﬀective population size. With such a strain, the competition dynamic
should be more similar to my strain A, or maybe C, than B. If this turns out to
be true, then competition experiments at various population sizes can be used
as a reliable tool to map out the neighborhood in ﬁtness space of a particular
virus strain.

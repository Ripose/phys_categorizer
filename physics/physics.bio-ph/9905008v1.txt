Limit Cycle Oscillations in Pacemaker Cells.

II. Existing Models

(3)

The model of Wilders et al. [2] of the pacemaker activity of
the rabbit sinoatrial node serves as an excellent example of the
many models where the membrane potential is thought to be
independent of the intracellular and extracellular charge concen-
trations. In that model the equation of motion for the voltage
is given by (2)

dv
dt

C

= −

(ib,Ca+ib,K+ib,Na+iCa,L+iCa,T+if +iK+iNa+iNaCa+iNaK) .

There are ﬁfteen dynamic variables in that model, the voltage v,
the gating variables dL, dT, fL, fT, x, y, h, m, p, and the ionic
concentrations [Ca]i, [Ca]rel, [Ca]up, [K]i, [Na]i. We want to
determine how the long term dynamics in that model is changed
when we change the initial conditions. To keep matters simple,
we only change one initial condition: the initial intracellular
concentration of potassium ([K]i); and we study the dynamics
in two dimensions only: the phase space of v and [K]i.

Abstract— In recent decades, several mathematical models de-
scribing the pacemaker activity of the rabbit sinoatrial node have
been developed. We demonstrate that it is not possible to es-
tablish the existence, uniqueness, and stability of a limit cycle
oscillation in those models. Instead we observe an inﬁnite num-
ber of limit cycles. We then display numerical results from a
new model, with a limit cycle that can be reached from many
diﬀerent initial conditions.

Keywords— Sinoatrial node, electrical activity, heart, mathe-

matical model, nonlinear dynamics.

I. Introduction

In elementary electrostatics it is well known that the relation
between the voltage and the charge of a capacitor is

where v is voltage, C is capasitance and q is charge. Diﬀerenti-
ating this equation with respect to time we obtain

q = Cv ,

dq
dt

= C

dv
dt

,

(1)

(2)

where dq
dt ≡ i is a current, and the sign of v is a matter of
convention. In physiology this second relation (2) is being used
to describe how the membrane potential (v) is changed when
ions move across the cell membrane. Unfortunately we observe
that this equation also is being used in some models where one
in addition keeps track of the charge (q) concentrations inside
and outside the cell [2]. In those models voltage and charge are
believed to be independent dynamic variables: ﬁrst one deter-
mines the voltage by integrating the membrane currents, then
one determines the charge by integrating the same membrane
currents.

The purpose of this article is to point out that integrating the
membrane currents once is enough. Voltage and charge cannot
simultaneously be independent dynamical variables in a model,
simply because of (1).

In order to visualize the drawbacks of treating voltage and
charge as independent variables, we explore numerically the
nonlinear dynamics of two diﬀerent models describing the pace-
maker activity of the rabbit sinoatrial node. The procedure is
as follows:
1. we integrate numerically the equations of motion for a suﬃ-
ciently long time to detect a steady state,
2. we change the initial conditions and repeat 1.

First we display results from the Wilders et al. model [2], a
model that treats voltage and charge as independent variables.
In that model it is thus possible to select an initial voltage and
an initial charge independently. The dynamics of that model
seems peculiar. An inﬁnity of limit cycles is observed: each time
we select new initial conditions a new limit cycle, corresponding
to a new value of the constant of motion q − Cv, is found. This
hampers the usefulness of the model.

Second we display results from a new model of Endresen et al.
[1], where the voltage is not a dynamic variable. Here we cannot
select an initial voltage independently of the initial charge, and
only one limit cycle is observed.

in [K]i corresponds to a large change in voltage v, since the
constant F V /C is large in most situations.

and [K]i = 130.

If the limit cycle in ﬁgure 1 (b) is unique it should be pos-
sible to reach it from another initial condition. Let us try an
initial condition below the limit cycle, and investigate whether
the model spiral up towards it. We change the initial concen-
tration of potassium from 140 to 130, leaving the fourteen other
initial conditions unchanged. The result is displayed in ﬁgure 2.
The model does not spiral upwards to the limit cycle in ﬁgure
1, instead the model spiral downwards to a diﬀerent limit cycle.
We observed numerically a new limit cycle for each new initial
value of [K]i, implying the existence of an inﬁnite number of
limit cycles. The model’s fundamental ﬂaw is clearly demon-
strated.

A New Model

In a new model [1] of the pacemaker activity of the rabbit sinoa-
trial node, the membrane potential is determined by (1)

v =

{[K]i − [K]e + 2([Ca]i − [Ca]e) + [Na]i − [Na]e} , (5)

F V
C

where q = F V {[K]i − [K]e + 2([Ca]i − [Ca]e) + [Na]i − [Na]e}
is the charge diﬀerence, F is Faraday’s constant and V is cell
volume. Here the ionic currents alter the concentrations which
in turn alter the voltage, i.e. the physical quantities were calcu-
lated in the following order: current i ⇒ charge q ⇒ voltage v.
The model has ﬁve dynamic variables, the gating variables x, h
and the ionic concentrations [Ca]i, [K]i, [Na]i, and we use the
initial conditions:

x = 0.9165
h = 0.0000
[K]i = variable
[Ca]i = 0.004094141
[Na]i = 18.73322695 .

In this model we ﬁrst notice that the initial value of [K]i, due
to (5), is not independent of the initial value of the voltage
v. Thus changing [K]i changes v as is always the case when
charging a capacitor (1). Second we notice that a tiny change

(a) the trajectory with [K]i = 130.650 (P1), in (b) the trajectory with

[K]i = 130.655 (P2), in (c) the trajectory with [K]i = 130.662 (P3), and in (d)

the unique limit cycle and the three initial conditions P1, P2 and P3 from (a),

(b) and (c).

In ﬁgure 3 we have displayed the simulation results from the
model of Endresen et al.
[1] with three slightly (due to the
large constant F V /C) diﬀerent initial values of [K]i: 130.650
(a), 130.655 (b), and 130.662 (c). In ﬁgure 3 (d) the three initial
conditions P1, P2 and P3 all converge towards the same limit
cycle.
In an extensive numerical study we have not observed
any physiological initial conditions that do not converge toward
this limit cycle.
In fact the same limit cycle can be reached
when starting from the full equilibrium situation with equal
intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations [1].

III. Discussion

We have displayed numerical results from two types of mathe-
matical models of the pacemaker activity of the rabbit sinoatrial
node. The ﬁrst type of model [2] showed an inﬁnite number of
limit cycles, the second type of model [1] a limit cycle that could
be reached from many diﬀerent initial conditions. In order to
avoid the drawback with an inﬁnite number of limit cycles seen
in the ﬁrst type of models, we suggest that one should not treat
membrane voltage (v) as a dynamic variable. Instead one should
calculate the voltage using (1), or at least select the initial con-
ditions in agreement with (1) [1].

Abstract

An important issue in theoretical epidemiology is the epidemic threshold

phenomenon, which specify the conditions for an epidemic to grow or die out.

In standard (mean-ﬁeld-like) compartmental models the concept of the basic

reproductive number, R0, has been systematically employed as a predictor for

epidemic spread and as an analytical tool to study the threshold conditions.

Despite the importance of this quantity, there are no general formulation of

R0 when one considers the spread of a disease in a generic ﬁnite population,

involving, for instance, arbitrary topology of inter-individual interactions and

heterogeneous mixing of susceptible and immune individuals. The goal of this

work is to study this concept in a generalized stochastic system described in

terms of global and local variables. In particular, the dependence of R0 on

the space of parameters that deﬁne the model is investigated; it is found that

near of the “classical” epidemic threshold transition the uncertainty about

the strength of the epidemic process still is signiﬁcantly large. The forecast-

ing attributes of R0 for a discrete ﬁnite system is discussed and generalized;

in particular, it is shown that, for a discrete ﬁnite system, the pretentious

predictive power of R0 is signiﬁcantly reduced.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is nowadays recognized that the phenomenon of health-disease in human communities

only may be understood by considering complex and dynamic inter-relations among several

factors operating simultaneously in multiple spatiotemporal and organizational scales. In

fact, the healthy and sick individual suﬀers uninterruptedly the eﬀects of the microbiological

evolution, the antropogenic environmental and ecosystem stress and many others misdeeds

resulting from socioeconomic inequalities. Therefore, it is not surprising to ﬁnd out the

proliferation of a myriad of methodological tools employed during the development of the

epidemiological research.

Among this methodological mosaic the mathematical and computer (or simulation) mod-

eling of communicable and infectious disease comes as a hypothetical-deductive approach

whose scope consists primarily in understanding and manipulating, a priori and to pre-

dictive purposes, the underlying mechanisms behind the origin and diﬀusion of epidemic

events. As a matter of fact, the attempt of understanding in what conditions pathogenic

agents (once invaded a host population) could establish themselves as an infection (the

transmission of pathogens from one host to another) resulted in the development of one

of the most important and thoroughly discussed concepts in infectious disease modeling

as early as in the beginning of the last century, namely the epidemic threshold. Thus, in

writings of R. Ross (1909) [1] the so-called mosquito theorem was the ﬁrst recognition of a

quantitative threshold deducing that it was not necessary to eliminate mosquitoes totally

in order to eradicate malaria. Two decades later would testify the publication of the classic

Kermack-McKendrick’s (1927) [2] paper that deﬁnitely consolidated the threshold concept

in epidemiologic literature. In this deterministic SIR model (S stands for susceptibles, I

for infected, and R for removed) an epidemic process is considered to evolve only when the

density of susceptible individuals is greater than a threshold value Sc. Bartlett (1957) [3],

3

based in a large amount of collected data of disease incidence in industrialized countries

introduced thirty years later another expression linking microbial invasion and threshold

parameters: the critical community size, that could explain the fade-out patterns of measles

epidemics.

However, the inherent individual heterogeneity and probabilistic local nature of interindi-

vidual relationships has been traditionally neglected in state-variable models like this; in fact,

in this population level approach all behavioral and individual variability are diluted into

the intercompartmental rates and densities or number of mean individuals —as S, I or R

compartments— described in terms of partial or ordinary diﬀerential equations. Neverthe-

less, it was subsequently possible to express the epidemic threshold in a way perhaps much

more intuitive when the focus changed to consider the infected host or the parasite itself,

instead of looking at the density or number of susceptible. In this perspective the thresh-

old condition that determines whether an infectious disease will spread in a susceptible

population has been described through the so-called basic reproduction number or also de-

nominated as basic reproductive rate, commonly denoted by R0 [4]. For microparasites such

as viruses or bacteria it may be biologically understood as the average number of secondary

cases produced or caused by one infected individual during its entire infectious period in

a completely susceptible population. Thus, the intrinsically individual based perspective

of this threshold concept should not be underestimated since the reproduction number can

link the inside-host evolutionary or pathogenic dynamic (microscale) and transmission pro-

cess at population level (macroscale). From a purely deterministic point of view it appears

intuitively evident that if R0 ≥ 1 the pathogen can undoubtedly establish itself in a host

population and, at least, an endemic regime will settle down. But this is a short-sighted

prediction since, specially to directly transmitted disease in ﬁnite populations, the mecha-

nisms that ensure the maintenance of the parasite within a community depends critically

on the way as the individuals interact one another, sometimes unforeseeable.

In this work we analyze limitations of the predictive power of the R0 parameter (as classi-

cally formulated) for the spread of a disease: Alternatively to population level approach and

4

state-variable models, stochastic inter-individual interactions are also used and its implica-

tions on the predictive attributes of the basic reproduction number R0 are studied through a

simpliﬁed model: a lattice based model including infectious period in that individual inter-

actions are straightforwardly described in terms of global ( Γ ) and local (Λ) variables, which

in turn can be tuned out to simulate respectively the populational mobility and geographical

neighborhood contacts.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section it is presented a

general formalism to the evolution of a population invaded by an infection. The formalism

is then applied in section 3, where concepts involving R0 and the threshold phenomenon

are discussed in order to deﬁne an invasion criterion for the infection and evaluation of R0.

The results are discussed in section 4. Although this work will be mainly concerned on R0

as a function of the model’s parameters, the formalism presented in what follows can be

applied to study a variety of epidemic scenarios.

II. THE MODEL SYSTEM

Consider a discrete dynamical system (discrete space and discrete time) where a popu-

lation of N individuals is distributed on the sites of a toroidal lattice M = {mij} —with

i and j varying from 1 to L (N = L × L). Each individual site mij is assigned to re-

ceive three personal speciﬁc attributes: (1) a spatial address or lattice position (i, j); (2 )

a set of three possible status, namely, s, i and r, specifying a clinic disease stage of each

particular individual, which represent, respectively, the conditions of susceptible (subject to

be infected by a contagious agent), infectious (eﬀectively transmitter of contagious agents)

and removed (recovered or immune); and ﬁnely (3) an infectious period τ , specifying how

many units of time an infected individual can propagate the contagious agent. Note that

s +

i +

r = N, with N constant.

Such a system is suitable mainly for describing a single epidemic in a closed system

(no birth or migration). The choice of such reduced model, however, is not far-fetched

5

because, as already mentioned above, the main interest here involves only very short period

of time, so that the dynamics of host births, migration, etc., are largely irrelevant. [5]. The

dynamic evolution of the population is described, step-by-step, by a set of a priori stated

interaction rules, and assumes that each new conﬁgurational state of the system (described

here by the geographical address (i, j) of each individual and by the instantaneous number

of

susceptibles S(t), infectives I(t), and removed individuals R(t) ) depends only on its

previous state. Hence, for the present purpose the spread of the disease in the population

is considered as being governed by the following rules:

1. Any susceptible individual may become infected with a probability pS. An infected

susceptible becomes infective after an average latency time τl (assumed here as τl = 0,

without lost of generality).

2. Infectives are removed deterministically from the system (becoming immune) after

an infectious period τ , that for simplicity is considered as constant for all infected

individuals.

3. Once in the removed class the individual participate only passively in the spreading

of the infection (eventual topological blocking) by a period of immunity greater than

the complete epidemic process.

During one time step, the three preceding rules are applied synchronously to all sites in

the lattice; the present model, therefore, can be viewed as a simple two-dimensional cellular

automaton. Actually, it is an adaptation of automata network to standard SIR models for

studying the spread of infectious diseases.

In this work, the probability pS, which is intended to be probability per unit of time, is

taken as the superposition of the local and global inﬂuences, in order to unify the individual-

based (contacts among nearest neighbors) and the standard mean-ﬁeld (homogeneously in-

teracting population) approaches. Therefore, one assumes that disease transmission occurs

with a total infection probability pS written as

6

pS = ΓpG + ΛpL,

(1)

where the pre-factors Γ and Λ are weight parameters tuning the short (cluster formation)

and long-range (mean-ﬁeld type) interactions; it is also required that Γ + Λ = 1 in order to

satisfy the probabilistic requirement 0 ≦ pS ≦ 1.

The global inﬂuence pG amounts to the probability of a susceptible to become infective

due to the ubiquity of I(t) infected individuals (mean-ﬁeld). So one can expect that in the

limit of large N (N → ∞), in each time step, any susceptible may become infected with

probability

pG =

δi,σ(k,l)

ρ
N X
{k,l}

(2)

where 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 is one of the model parameters:

it limits the maximum value of pG and

is related to the intrinsic mobility of the population; the sum sweeps all lattice sites {k, l},

and δi,σ(k,l) is the Kronecker delta function which assumes the value “one” when the state

σ of the site (k, l) corresponds to the infectious state i, and “zero” otherwise (σ(k, l) can

be s, i or r). Actually, the sum in the Equation 2 just counts the instantaneous number of

infectious individuals I(t) in the population.

On the other hand, the local term pL = pL(i, j) is the probability of a susceptible

individual (located at the site (i, j)) contracting infection due to n infectives ﬁrst and second

neighbors ( 0 ≤ n ≤ 8 is a integer number corresponding to all possible combinations of

(i + ξ, j + ξ), with ξ = 0, 1, −1). Therefore, let λ ∈ [0, 1] be the probability of a particular

susceptible when just one of its neighbors is infective. Hence, (1 − λ)n will be the probability

for not contracting the disease when exposed to n infectives. Therefore, the chance of he

(or she) contracting the disease in a unit of time is [6]

pL = 1 − (1 − λ)n .

(3)

Thus, when λ = 1 the infection spreads deterministically, with 8 nearest neighbors to any

infective being infected (the choice for equipotent ﬁrst and second neighbors was adopted

because the use of only the four nearest neighbors is unduly restricting).

7

The expression for pG is a convenient and simple way for describing the populational

mobility. It is based on the mass action law, borrowed from the chemistry, and gets new

meaning here under the perspective of pairwise spatially disordered interactions through the

population elements. In this sense, it is a result of the small-word eﬀect, and so became a

particular version of the small-word lattice of Watts and Strogatz [7]

This simple approach allows to study in great detail the dynamical behavior of the model

in the full space of control parameters λ and ρ, and the local and global balance pre-factors Λ

and Γ. Therefore, the system is governed by pS (Eq.1) and τ , and its temporal evolution is

determined by updating the lattice synchronously at each time step through the application

of the three rules above.

III. R0 AND THE THRESHOLD PHENOMENON

The probability pL as in the Eq.(3) [8], [6], and in a number of alternative forms [9],

has been employed in the analogy between percolation and epidemic. Since that the critical

value pc, in which random clusters grow to inﬁnite size, is know (analytic or numerically) for

any lattices, pc may be used as a powerful general criterion for “epidemic spread” [10], [9].

However, due to the traditional importance of the concept of R0 in the epidemic scenario,

this threshold is generalized for ﬁnite discrete systems, as described above, in order to show

its relevance for an intrinsically individual based perspective of the problem.

The overall structure of the model presented here shows the interplay of two types

of transmission mechanisms by assuming that each infectious individual interacts strongly

(physically) with their few susceptible neighbors, and uniformly and weakly with each par-

ticular susceptible in the population of susceptibles. Thus, the local mode of transmission

pL incorporates the individual-based component from the perspective of the susceptible in-

dividuals, the actual (physical) contacts that each susceptible experiences, and the global

probability pG, due to intrinsic populational mobility, which may be viewed as resulting of a

mean-ﬁeld (discrete) approach, in the sense that the disease transmission to each susceptible

8

individual also depends on the instantaneous total number of infectious individuals in the

population.

To better appreciate the consequences of this formulation, it is ﬁrstly run simulations

for the extreme values of the tuning pre-factors through the procedure described above.

These cases allow to recover the two modes of transmission in its pure form corresponding

to the (i) homogeneous mixing approximation (mean ﬁeld), when Γ = 1, and to the (ii)

percolation process (the transmission occurs by localized individual contact), when Λ = 1.

Furthermore, it is considered the damage ∆I on a susceptible population due to just one

infected individual (I(0) = 1) landing in a totally susceptible population (S(0) = N − 1 and

R(0) = 0) during the infectious period τ ; to calculate ∆I it is considered only the number

of new infected individuals in the population after τ time steps, ignoring infections from the

victims of these ﬁrst infected individual (operationally, it is enough to consider the latency

τl > τ , that is, a latent period of infection greater then the infectious period). The Figures

1a and 1b show, respectively, the simulation results for ∆I as function of ρ for Γ = 1, and

the behavior of ∆I as a function of the contact probability λ for Λ = 1 (that is, Γ = 0); the

system size considered in most of the simulations presented here was L = 100 (population

size N = L × L = 104), although some extra diﬀerent sizes L/2 and 2L) were also used in

order to verify ﬁnite size eﬀects. Γ = 1 and Λ = 1 are the two limiting cases usually taken as

references in studying the eﬀect on the system when both mechanisms are superposed; the

amount ∆I is obtained after τ = 10 time steps (covering exactly the infectious period) and

was estimated as an average over 31 independent simulations (what is equivalent to verify

the establishment of infection on 31 distinct populations with the same pattern of contacts

among the individuals).

The linear pattern observed for ∆I vs ρ means that the present stochastic approach

reproduces qualitatively the classical basic reproductive number R0 if one identiﬁes ∆I as

the average number of secondary cases that an infectious individual causes.

Indeed, the

linear relation ∆I = [ ρ

N S(0)] τ ﬁts pretty well the data shown in Figure 1a, and so one

9

may consider that infectives make contacts at a mean rate [ ρ

N S(0)] throughout an infectious

period of length τ (note that for large enough populations ρ

N S(0) → ρ). On the other hand,

when Λ = 1, the amount ∆I represents R0 for the case where individuals interact only with

their spatial nearest neighbors, and so its values saturates at ∆I = 8 for λ & 0.3. For

each particular run, signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations on ∆I are observed (mainly for smaller N) but

averaging over 31 runs is enough to smooth considerably the curves, as shown in Figure 1.

Before to proceed through the application of the present formulation, some comments re-

garding the deﬁnition of the R0 are in order. The basic reproduction number has been widely

used as a predictor parameter conceived to indicate the epidemic potential of a pathogen

once it has introduced in a totally susceptible population.

In fact, to deterministic and

continuous (in space and in time) population-system models the future fate of an infectious

agent has been expressed through the threshold condition. Accordingly, when R0 > 1, in-

fections can invade a totally susceptible population and persist; if R0 < 1, the disease then

dies out and can not establish itself. To the special condition R0 = 1, there is an endemic

regime in that the unique initial infectious case reproduces subsequently just one infectious

secondary case and son on.

This assumption in modelling of the establishment of an infection (which is possibly

wrong) [11] will be partially preserved here to have the classical treatment as a reference

but, indeed, to capture more realistic or probable practical situations is of interesse that the

“ﬁrst analytical look” at a population be considered when the epidemic process is already

in course. For instance, at the initial time t0 one may consider the arbitrary situation in

that I(t = t0) >> 1 at the same time that the number of removed individuals is also large,

and then ask the question: What is the value for the reproduction number in this case? To

answer this question one may generalize the concept of R0 as the normalized average number

R(t0; τ ) of secondary cases (reproductive ratio) about the time t0, due to I(t0) infectious

present in the population at t = t0, through the following expression

R(t0; τ ) = P

t0+τ

t0 DP{k,l}s(ΓpG + ΛpL)En
I(t0)

,

(4)

10

where the brackets means an average on a set of n independent runs in the time interval

[t0, t0 + τ ], and the sum over {k, l} sweeps all sites occupied by individuals in the status

s (susceptibles). Note that all the instantaneous extensive and intensive conditions of the

population, at any arbitrary time t0, are all taken into account, as for example, the sites in

the removed status randomly scattered through the population (acting as epidemic shield

protectors), and the set remaining infectious time τ (k, l; t0) for each individual in the status

i located at the site (k, l). These conditions certainly aﬀect the epidemic process and the

progression of the epidemic process depends in some how on the reproduction number’s value,

(that is, if R(t0; τ ) > 1 or < 1). But, as already mentioned above, the initial condition

I(t = t0) = 1 will be deliberately used in the present work in order to maintain the original

intention of comparing the traditional deterministic deﬁnition of the basic reproductive ratio

R0 with the present stochastic approach.

In order to infer how the intrinsic stochastic nature of the epidemic process aﬀects the

predictive attributes of R0, the concept of epidemic probability PE is introduced. Numerically

it is estimated directly from the simulation experiments based on the algorithm of the

previous section. Indeed, it is just given by the ratio PE = ne/n, where ne is the number of

runs in that at least one susceptibles was infected during the infectious period, and n is the

total number of runs or experimental populations. The probability PE may be expressed

as function of the mean reproduction number R0, which also is determined from the same

simulation experiments by using the Equation 4 above.

In the Figure 2 it is shown the

resulting PE as a function of R0 with Γ = Λ = 0.5 and ρ and λ varying in the interval

(0 − 0.2]. The large number of scattered points in the graph, mainly at larger R0, is an

intrinsic aspect of this graph due to the fact that in the parameter space (ρ, λ) there are

diﬀerent combinations of ρ and λ resulting in approximately the same values for R0, as it is

illustrated in Figure 3. Therefore only the stochastic component of such scattering of points

may be reduced by increasing the number of runs used in the averaging procedure.

The amount PE tends to saturates at PE ≃ 1 when the value of R0 is suﬃcient large

(R0 & 3), so that the epidemic spread in the population almost always is observed. Fur-

11

thermore, the results showed in the Figure 2 means that only for large enough R0 (actually

R0 > 3) one can be sure about an epidemic development in the population, while that,

even for R0 < 1 there is still a possibility to have an epidemic spread. Therefore, from the

epidemic control perspective, reducing the eﬀective reproductive number to a level below

one, upon vaccination, for instance, could be a potential problem of strategy since that for

R0 . 1 in about 60% of events this strategy will fail, that is, an epidemic process should
∼= 1, under the conditions of the present model.

be established with chance of 60% for R0

More pointedly, despite the claim of the threshold criterium, it is improbable to recognize

(using only standard census data) the imminence of any epidemic disaster if the system is

near to the threshold region. [12] The more accurate (although frustrating) criterium is to

realize that, irrespective the value of R0 that the level of vaccination forces, there is always

a chance (even thought small) of the disease re-invading the population.

The same system size N = 104 was employed in order to get all the results discussed

above. However, in order to verify eventual eﬀect of the system size on the results, two

extra systems were considered, namely a smaller N = 4−1 × 104 and a bigger N = 4 × 104

system, but no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found. Clearly ﬂuctuations are smaller for larger

systems mainly because the chance of nucleation of closer cluster due to the global term ΓpG

decreases with the system size N, reducing then the chance of the magniﬁcation eﬀect of the

local term ΛpL on eventual clusters located nearly enough each other. The Figure 4a shows

for PE vs R0 (in the interval 0 < R0 ≤ 2) for two diﬀerent system sizes; note that the size

eﬀect is pronounced only on the second moment (dispersion of the data) of the distribution

of PE for each R0. More precisely, the Figure 4b shows the normalized standard deviation

(relative error) σR0 as function of R0 for the larger 4 × 104 system. A decreasing 1/R0− like

behavior for the relative error is a consequence of the averaging of integer quantities, that

is: R0 = (0 × n0 + 1 × n1 + 2 × n2 + 3 × n3+ · · ·)/η; where η = n0 + n1 + n3+ · · ·, and nk is

the number of experiments in which exactly k susceptibles were infected.

Finally, the numerical equivalence between R′

0 estimated by an analytical approximation

and R0 calculated by simulation is veriﬁed. For this purpose R′

0 is considered in the limit

12

of large populations (N → ∞) by taking the mean number of susceptible infected by just

one infective during its infectious period τ , through the following direct expression

R′

The Figure 5 shows the parametric graph of R′

0 vs R0 where they are calculated, respec-

tively, by Equation (5) above and by simulation using the proposed probabilistic approach

represented in Equation (4), with I(t0 = 0) = 1. Strong correlation between the two ways

for estimating the basic reproduction number is kept only for values of ρ and λ not too large

(R0 . 2) because during the time τ, the local term that composes R0 (Eq.4) may change

from zero up to eight, while this limit is not present in the Equation (5). However, that is

enough in order to validate the conclusions about the predictive attributes of PE = PE(R0)

because R′

0 and R0 are numerically equivalent: the result given by Equation 5, although

intuitive, follows from a stochastic representation of the classical SIR model [13].

IV. FINAL COMMENTS

In this paper a stochastic version of the original SIR model (involving only single epi-

demics) was introduced with the main purpose of to characterize and re-interpret the con-

ditions for the establishment of an epidemic in a population through the concept of basic

reproduction number (R0). A peculiar characteristic of the present approach is the assump-

tion that the probability of a susceptible individual become infective is a superposition of the

local and global inﬂuences. Using as initial conﬁguration just one single infected individual

in a fully susceptible population, condition frequently used to deﬁne R0, it was demonstrated

that the discrete character of a ﬁnite population reduces the pretentious predictability of the

threshold criteria, and so it is, indeed, an incomplete predictive tool since that, irrespective

to the value of R0, an epidemic has a ﬁnite probability to establish itself, due the inherent

stochastic nature of any ﬁnite epidemic system.

13

Indeed, more consistent derivation of R0 has been tried, even though using the same

classical deterministic approach, due to the too widely estimate obtained to R0, which in

recent applications for the smallpox have varied from R0 = 1.5 to > 20 [14]. Rather than

just a caricature of the original formulation of R0, the approach presented in this paper

may be viewed as a simpler and generic alternative for investigating the spread of diseases

in a population, which may greatly facilitate the analysis of a number of distinct epidemic

scenarios. Particularly, a system with increasing topological complexity can be easily tackled.

For example, one may consider the practical situation in that, at an arbitrary initial time

t0, the population has already many infectious individuals (that is, I(t0) >> 1), and also

many immunes scattered through the population (working as epidemic shield) and then try

to answer the question: What is the value for the reproduction number in this case?

Finally, as a major challenge that this “microscopic” approach can handle, one may

think on the possibility of incorporating in the traditional deﬁnition of R0 the underlying

evolutionary dynamics of the pathogenic agent. This view is in contrast with the standard

epidemiological models, which tend to use a constant absolute parasite ﬁtness R0. However,

more detailed considerations on the investigation of this avenue of research is left for a future

contribution.

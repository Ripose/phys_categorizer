Abstract

In this Communication we present statistical analysis of conservation proﬁles in families
of homologous sequences for nine proteins whose folding nucleus was determined by protein
engineering methods. We show that in all but one protein (AcP) folding nucleus residues
are signiﬁcantly more conserved than the rest of the protein. Two aspects of our study are
especially important: 1) grouping of amino acids into classes according to their physical-
chemical properties and 2) proper normalization of amino acid probabilities that reﬂects
the fact that evolutionary pressure to conserve some amino acid types may itself aﬀect
concentration of various amino acid types in protein families. Neglect of any of those two
factors may make physical and biological “signals” from conservation proﬁles disappear.

Introduction

It is now widely accepted that folding of small single-domain proteins follows “nucleation-
condensation” mechanism (Abkevich et al., 1994; Itzhaki et al., 1995; Fersht, 1997; Shakhnovich,
1997; Guo & Thirumalai, 1995; Pande et al., 1998) whereby relatively small fragment of pro-
tein structure is formed in the transition state between unfolded and folded states. Residues
belonging to this fragment constitute speciﬁc folding nucleus (SFN). Considerable experimental
(Itzhaki et al., 1995; Main et al., 1999; Martinez et al., 1998; Chiti et al., 1999) and theoretical
(Abkevich et al., 1994; Klimov & Thirumalai, 1998; Li et al., 2000; Dokholyan et al., 2000)
eﬀort has been devoted to identiﬁcation of folding nuclei in real proteins and various models as
well as factors that determine its location in structure and in sequence.

One of the most intriguing aspect of nucleation-condensation mechanism of protein fold-
Indeed residues constituting folding nucleus can be
ing is its relation to protein evolution.
metaphorically considered “accelerator pedals” of folding (Mirny et al., 1998a) since mutations
in those positions aﬀect folding rate to a much greater extent than elsewhere in a protein.
One can conclude that if there is evolutionary control of folding rate it should have resulted in
additional pressure applied on folding nucleus residues, and such pressure can be manifested in
noticeable additional conservation of nucleus residues.

This idea was ﬁrst proposed in (Shakhnovich et al., 1996) where it was applied to prediction
of nucleus residues from protein structure. Many sequences were designed to ﬁt the structure
of Chymotripsin Inhibitor 2 (CI2) with low energy. Positions conserved among the designed
sequences were identiﬁed as a putative nucleus. This way blind predictions of folding nucleus
in CI2 were made that were veriﬁed in independent experiments (Itzhaki et al., 1995).

In related studies papers Ptitsyn studied conservatism in distant yet related by sequence
homology members of Cytochrome C (Ptitsyn, 1998) and myoglobin (Ptitsyn & Ting, 1999)
families. In both cases he found conserved clusters of residues without an obvious functional role
which he suggested to belong to folding nucleus of those proteins. Michnick and Shakhnovich
(Michnick & Shakhnovich, 1998) carried out an analysis of conservation in natural and designed
sequences for families of three structurally related proteins - ubiquitin, raf and ferredoxin and
predicted possible folding nucleus for those proteins.

Neverteheless the notion of folding nucleus conservation has drawn some controvercy in
the lietrature. While earlier papers (Shakhnovich et al., 1996; Michnick & Shakhnovich, 1998;
Ptitsyn, 1998; Ptitsyn & Ting, 1999) suggested conservation of folding nucleus in some proteins,
a more recent paper by Plaxco and coauthors (Plaxco et al., 2000) argued to the opposite. These
authors looked at conservatism proﬁle in several protein families for which protein engineering
analysis of folding transition states has been carried out, and did not observe correlation between
conservation and experimentally measured φ-values. This made them conclude that there is no
evolutionary pressure to control the folding rates.

In this work we study evolutionary conservation of the folding nucleus for several homologous
proteins. Conservation of the folding nucleus is systematically compared with the conservation
in the rest of the protein sequence. In contrast to previous studies, we perform rigorous statis-
tical test to assess signiﬁcance of higher conservation in the folding nucleus. The main result
of this study is that for all studied proteins, except AcP, folding nucleus is signiﬁcantly more
conserved than the rest of the protein. We explain the diﬀerence between our thorough statis-
tical analysis and that of Plaxco et al (Plaxco et al., 2000) by pointing out to some technical
shortcomings in the earlier work (Plaxco et al., 2000).

Results and Discussion

To study evolutionary conservation of the folding nucleus we turn to nine proteins for which
nucleus has been experimentally identiﬁed from protein engineering analysis: CI2, FKBP12,
ACBP, CheY, Tenascin, CD2.d1, U1A, AcP and ADA2h. For each of them we obtain a multiple
sequence alignment from HSSP database (Dodge et al., 1998) (or PFAM (Bateman et al., 2000)
database if HSSP contains too few sequences). We compute variability at position l of the
alignment as

s(l) = −

pi(l) log pi(l)

(1)

where pi(l) is the frequency of residues from class i in position l. We use six classes of residues
to reﬂect physical-chemical properties of amino acids and their natural pattern of substitutions:
aliphatic [A V L I M C], aromatic [F W Y H], polar [S T N Q], basic [K R], acidic [D E], and
special (reﬂecting their special conformational properties) [G P]. As a result of this classiﬁcation
mutations within a class are ignored (e.g. V → L), while mutations that change the class are
taken into account. Figure 1 presents variability proﬁle for studied proteins with nucleation
positions marked by ﬁlled circles. Importantly, we deﬁned the folding nucleus as it was identiﬁed Fig.1
by the original experimental groups (Table 1).

Figure 2 clearly shows that nucleus residues are almost always among the most conserved Fig.2

ones for all studied proteins. It also shows that nucleus residues are not the only conserved
ones: many other residues (predominantly in the cores of the proteins) are also conserved.

In order to evaluate statistical signiﬁcance of nucleus conservation we compare evolutionary
conservation of the folding nucleus with the conservation of all residues in the protein using
the following statistical test. We start from the null hypothesis H0 that nucleus residues are

6

X
i=1

3

no more conserved than the whole protein sequence. To test this hypothesis we compute
median variability of the nucleus residues (med[snuc]) and compare it with the distribution
of medians variability of the same number of residues randomly chosen in the same protein
(f (med[srand])). The distribution f (med[srand]) is obtained by choosing 105 random sets of
n residues (n is the number of residues in the nucleus). Then the fraction of instances with
med[srand] < med[snuc] gives the probability P0 of accepting H0.
In other words, P0 is the
probability that observed lower variability of the folding nucleus is obtained by chance. Hence,
P0 ≤ α indicates statistically signiﬁcant strong evolutionary conservation of the folding nucleus.
Below we use conﬁdence level α = 2%.

Table 2 presents computed P0 values. The main result of this work is that in all proteins,
except AcP, residues in the folding nucleus are signiﬁcantly more conserved than the rest of the
protein.

Next we study how obtained results depend on the way amino acids are grouped into
classes (see Table 2). When classiﬁcation scheme from (Branden & Tooze, 1998) (BT) is
used, still all proteins except AcP exhibit signiﬁcant conservation of the folding nucleus. This
clearly demonstrates that observed conservation of the folding nucleus is not a consequence of
a particular choice of the classiﬁcation scheme.

However, when amino acids are not grouped into classes, nucleus exhibits signiﬁcant conser-
vation only in four out of nine proteins. Taken together these results indicate that substitutions
in the folding nucleus may occur, but they are limited to residues that belong to the same class
(i.e. have similar physical-chemical properties (Thompson & Goldstein, 1996)).

To study what physical-chemical properties are conserved in the folding nucleus we used
various classiﬁcation schemes. Starting from all 20 amino acids, we grouped some of them
into classes and repeated the analysis, including the statistical tests (see Table 2). The goal
is to ﬁnd a minimal classiﬁcation (i.e. grouping the minimal number of amino acids together)
that provides statistically signiﬁcant conservation of the folding nucleus. Our results show that
classiﬁcation where only I, L, and V are grouped in one class while all other amino acids each
represent their own class satisﬁes this requirement (see Table 2).This classiﬁcation provides
signiﬁcant conservation of the nucleus for all proteins except AcP with α = 5%, and for all
proteins except AcP and FKBP12 with α = 2%. This result demonstrates that I ⇀↽ L ⇀↽ V
are the most common substitutions in the nucleus (and in the protein core in general (Henikoﬀ
& Henikoﬀ, 1992; Benner et al., 1994)). These substitutions are tolerated in the nucleus as
they do not change much neither stability of the native fold nor the folding rate. Analysis
of available experimental data (L.Li unpublished) shows that changes in stability upon I ⇀↽
L ⇀↽ V mutations are in average h∆∆GN −Di = 1.0 ± 0.4kCal mol−1 for the native state and
h∆∆G‡−Di = 0.2 ± 0.3 kCal mol−1 for the transition state.

Note that grouping of residues into classes to assess conservation is similar to the use of
substitution matrices in sequence alignment techniques. The underlying idea for both methods
is to take into account natural physical-chemical similarity between amino acids and their
substitution patterns. Plaxco et all used all 20 types of amino acids and failed to identify
strong conservation of the folding nucleus (Plaxco et al., 2000). Similarly, a method that
relies on simple sequence identity cannot detect distant homology. However distant homology

4

between sequences can be detected using proper substitution matrices (Abagyan & Batalov,
1997; Brenner et al., 1998). The use of substitution matrices is physically meaningful since
they weight, e.g., I − V match higher then I − D, while a method that relays on percentage
of sequence identity weights I − V and I − D equally. Likewise, our amino acid classiﬁcation
scheme does not count I → V as a mutation, while it certainly considers substitutions like
I → D as mutations to be counted.

Although, on average, nucleus is more conserved, than the rest of the protein, not all
nucleating residues are strongly conserved. For example, in CheY two out of ten nucleation
residues are not conserved. In ADA2h two out of ﬁve and in tenascin one out of four residues are
not conserved. Some nucleus residues may be less conserved because they belong to “extended
nucleus” (Mirny & Shakhnovich, 1999) or because of limitation of our residues classiﬁcation
scheme that puts aromatic and aliphatic residues into two diﬀerent groups, while aromatic-
aliphatic substitutions may occur in the core of some proteins (i.e. tenascin, ADA2h) usually as
a result of correlated mutations that are not treated properly in this approach (but are taken into
account in the conservation-of-conservation approach (Mirny & Shakhnovich, 1999)). Another
interesting observation is that the only protein that exhibits no preferential conservation of the
folding nucleus is AcP, which is the slowest folding protein among all studied two-state folding
= 0.23s−1). Perhaps, this protein did not undergo evolutionary selection for
proteins (kH2O
faster folding and hence its folding nucleus is under no additional pressure to be conserved.

f

Note that, as expected, several other residues in studied proteins are as conserved as the
nucleating ones. (see Fig.2) Those are the residues of the active site, core hydrophobic residues
responsible for stabilization of the native structure and others. This suggests that although
folding nucleus is conserved it can not be uniquely identiﬁed just by analysis of a single protein
family as a pattern of conservation is dominated by residues conserved for protein stability and
function (see (Mirny & EI, )). Thus a consistent analysis should discriminate between residues
that are conserved for functional reasons, for stability reasons and for kinetic reasons (folding
nucleus), like it was done in a more detailed conservation-of-conservation analysis in (Mirny &
Shakhnovich, 1999).

Why do results of our analysis diﬀer from those of Plaxco et al (Plaxco et al., 2000)? First,
we took into account physical-chemical properties of amino acids and their natural substitution
patterns to group amino acids into classes. As we showed, substitutions of large aliphatic
residues (I,L,V) are frequent in folding nuclei and this confused previous analysis that did not
apply any amino acid classiﬁcation scheme. While Plaxco et al claimed in their paper (Plaxco
et al., 2000) (without providing a supporting evidence) that grouping of amino acids into classes
did not change their conclusions, our analysis shows that proper classiﬁcation of amino acids is
crucial for detecting conservation in the folding nucleus.

Second, Plaxco et al used a diﬀerent method to compute sequence variability:

s2(l) = − X
i

pi(l) log[pi(l)/p0
i ]

(2)

This equation diﬀers from eq.(1), used in this study, in normalization by p0
i - the “background”
frequency of residue type i in all proteins. Although the diﬀerence may seem technical, equations

5

(1) and (2) are based on two diﬀerent models of evolution. We argue that while equation 2
may be adequate for DNA sequence analysis (Stormo, 1998) it is not appropriate for analysis
of protein evolution.

Equation 2 implicitly assumes that amino acid composition p0
i

is ﬁxed a priori in each
protein. Hence equation (2) tends to underestimate conservation of “frequent” amino acids
(L,A,S etc), while overestimating conservation of less frequent amino acids (W,C,H etc). In
contrast, equation (1) assumes that conservation requirement itself aﬀects the composition, i.e.
higher conservation of an amino acid leads to its higher frequency in proteins.

To illustrate this point consider a toy protein that consists of two types of residues: hy-
drophobic H and polar P. Assume that 70% of amino acids in this proteins are in the core
and 30% are in the loops. Also assume that in the toy world selection for stability requires a
100% conservation of H amino acids in the core, while loops are under no evolutionary pressure
and H and P are equally probable in the loops. Then p0
H = 1 · 0.70 + 0.5 · 0.3 = 0.85 and
p0
P = 0.5 · 0.3 = 0.15. At conserved core positions s2(core) = −1 log 1/0.85 ≈ −0.16, while in
the loops s2(loops) = −0.5 log 0.5/0.85 − 0.5 log 0.5/0.15 ≈ −0.34. Hence, the use of equation
(2 leads to a counterintuitive and apparently wrong result s2(core) > s2(loops), i.e. that loops
are more conserved than 100% conserved core! Clearly this result shows inadequacy of equation
(2) as applied to protein evolution with unconstrained composition. Similarly, application of
equation 2 to real proteins leads to unreasonably low conservation of the hydrophobic core as
compared to exposed loops (data not shown).

A possible way to compensate for variations in amino acid composition of proteins is to

deﬁne the sequence entropy as in (Schneider, 1999):

s(l) = − X
i

pi(l) log pi(l) + X
i

i log p0
p0

i

(3)

where the second term gives the “background” variability due to amino acid composition. This
term however does not depend on l and hence does not change the relative variability.

Interestingly, the use of equation (2) by Plaxco et al (Plaxco et al., 2000) gave rise to a
surprising result that active sites in proteins are generally no more conserved than the rest of
the protein (see Fig.2 of (Plaxco et al., 2000)). Conservation of known active sites was used
as a control in (Plaxco et al., 2000) for their method of analysis based on equation 2 which it
apparently failed.

Finally, Plaxco et al did not study conservation of the folding nucleus. Instead, they focused
on the residues that featured high φ-values in protein engineering experiments and compared
them with low φ-value residues. As we explained above residues in the folding nucleus do not
necessarily exhibit high φ-values, and many low φ-value residues are conserved in evolution as
they contribute to stabilization of the native structure. Comparison with low φ-value residues
instead of comparison with the whole protein also confused previous analysis since most of φ-
values have been measured for amino acids located in the the core of a protein and hence these
amino acids are on average more conserved. Here, in contrast, we used the folding nucleus as it
was identiﬁed for each protein by the original experimental group and compared its conservation
with the conservation of all amino acids in the protein.

6

In summary, we showed that folding nucleus is indeed conserved in most of the proteins
whose folding transition states are known from protein engineering analysis. That does not
mean that folding nucleus residues are the the only conserved ones in any family of homologous
proteins. That also may not mean that folding nucleus is more conserved than other residues in
the protein core, as nucleus is equally important for protein stability and for fast folding. Our
result show that the folding nucleus is more conserved than the rest of the protein. As stated
earlier it is diﬃcult to uniquely identify folding nucleus by looking at a conservation proﬁle in
just one family of homologous sequences. Nevertheless conservation of folding nucleus found in
this paper and in other works (Mirny & Shakhnovich, 1999; Li et al., 2000) points out to an
exciting possibility that folding rates may be of biological signiﬁcance. Biological signiﬁcance
of this fact needs to be assessed in future studies.

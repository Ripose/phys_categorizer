Abstract

Detailed ionic models of cardiac cells are diﬃcult for numerical simulations because they consist
of a large number of equations and contain small parameters. The presence of small parameters,
however, may be used for asymptotic reduction of the models. Earlier results have shown that
the asymptotics of cardiac equations are non-standard. Here we apply such a novel asymptotic
method to an ionic model of human atrial tissue in order to obtain a reduced but accurate
model for the description of excitation fronts. Numerical simulations of spiral waves in atrial
tissue show that wave fronts of propagating action potentials break-up and self-terminate. Our
model, in particular, yields a simple analytical criterion of propagation block, which is similar in
purpose but completely diﬀerent in nature to the ‘Maxwell rule’ in the FitzHugh-Nagumo type
models. Our new criterion agrees with direct numerical simulations of break-up of re-entrant
waves. Key words: excitation; conduction; refractoriness; mathematical model

Introduction

Refractoriness is a fundamental characteristic of biological excitable media, including cardiac tis-
sues. The boundary between absolute and relative refractoriness can be deﬁned as the boundary
between the ability and the inability of the medium to conduct excitation waves [1]. Transient
conduction block is thought to be a key event in the initiation of re-entrant arrhythmias and in
the development and the self-perpetuation of atrial and ventricular ﬁbrillation [2, 3, 4, 5]. So it
is important to understand well the immediate causes and conditions of propagation blocks and
sudden break-ups in such nonstationary regimes. The aim of the present work is to improve
this understanding via analysis of a mathematical model of human atrial tissue [6].

Kohl et al. [7] distinguish two types of single-cell cardiac models: ‘membrane potential mod-
els’ and ‘ionic current models’. The membrane potential models attempt to represent cellular
electrical activity by describing, with a minimal number of equations, the spatio-temporal course
of changes in membrane potential. Their equations are constructed using a dynamical-systems
arguments to caricature various properties and processes of cardiac function. Examples of this
type of models start with the mathematical description of heartbeat as a relaxation oscillator
by van der Pol and van der Mark [8] and continue to play an important role in describing bio-
physical behaviour [9] with the the most successful one arguably being the FitzHugh-Nagumo
equations [10, 11],

where V and g are dynamical variables corresponding to the action potential and the cardiac
current gating variables, ǫV , ǫg, γ, and β are parameters and D is a diﬀusion constant. An
attractive feature of this approach is that, along with a reasonable description of excitability,
threshold, plateau and refractoriness, it focusses on genetic equations which can often be treated
analytically and their dynamical properties can be extended and applied to very diﬀerent phys-
ical, chemical or biological problems of similar mathematical structure. The main drawback of
these models, however, is their lack of an explicit correspondence between model components
and constituent parts of the biological system, e.g. ion channels and transporter proteins. The
second type of models, the ionic current models, attempt to model action potential (AP) be-
haviour on the basis of ion ﬂuxes in as much detail as possible in order to ﬁt experimental
data and predict behaviour under previously untested conditions. This class of models has
been started by the work of Hodgkin and Huxley [12] on giant squid axon, then extended to
cardiac cells by Noble [13, 14] and now such models are available for various types of cells in
diﬀerent species, in norm and pathology [15]. The ionic models have been successfully applied
to study various conditions of metabolic activity and excitation-contraction coupling, feedback
mechanisms, response to drugs, etc. However, these models are very complicated and have to be
studied mostly numerically. Their numerical study is aggravated by stiﬀness of the equations,
i.e. broad range of characteristic time scales of dynamic variables caused by numerous small
parameters of the models.

The problem of conditions for propagation has an elegant solution in FitzHugh-Nagumo
system Eqs. 1 and its generalizations, within an asymptotic theory exploiting the diﬀerence
ǫV in case of Eqs. 1 [16]. The answer is
of time scales of diﬀerent variables, such as ǫg ≪
formulated in terms of the instant values of the slow variables (g in Eqs. 1), and claims that
excitation will propagate if the deﬁnite integral of the kinetic term in the right hand side of the
equation for the fast variable (V in Eqs. 1 ), between the lower and the upper quasi-stationary

states, is positive [17, see eq. 4.5]. This is similar to Maxwell’s ‘equal areas’ rule in the theory
of phase transitions[18, see section 9.3]. In case of Eqs. 1 , this rule boils down to an inequality
for the slow variable g: excitation front will propagate if the value of g at it is less than a certain
g
. However, FitzHugh-Nagumo type models completely misrepresent the idiosyncratic ‘front
∗
dissipation’ scenario by which propagation block happens in the ionic current models [19]. The
reason is that small parameters in such models appear in essentially diﬀerent ways from the one
assumed by the standard asymptotic theory [20, 21]. So, this elegant ‘Maxwell rule’ solution is
not applicable to any realistic models.

We have developed an alternative asymptotic approach based on special mathematical prop-
erties of the detailed ionic models, not captured by the standard theory [22]. This approach
demonstrated excellent quantitative accuracy for APs in isolated Noble-1962 model cells [21],
and correctly, on a qualitative level, described the front dissipation mechanism of break-up of
re-entrant waves in Courtemanche et al. [6] model of human atrial tissue, although quantitative
correspondence with the full model was poor [23]. In this paper we suggest, for the ﬁrst time, a
reﬁned simpliﬁed asymptotic model of a cardiac excitation front, which provides numerically ac-
curate prediction of the front propagation velocity (within 16 %) and its proﬁle (within 0.7 mV).
It also gives an analytical condition of propagation block in a re-entrant wave, expressed as a
simple inequality involving the slow inactivation gate j of the fast sodium current, which is in
excellent agreement with results of direct numerical simulations of the Courtemanche et al. [6]
full ionic model of 21 partial diﬀerential equations.

currents except the fast sodium current INa, the dynamic variables V , m, h, ua, oa and d are
deﬁned in [6], U = (j, oi, . . . , Nai, Ki, . . . )T is the vector of all other, slower variables, and F is
the vector of the corresponding right-hand sides. The rationale for this parameterisation is:

1. The dynamic variables V , m, h, ua, w, oa, d are ‘fast variables’, i.e. they change sig-
niﬁcantly during the upstroke of a typical AP potential, unlike all other variables which
change only slightly during that period.

2. A speciﬁc feature of V is that it is fast only because of one of the terms in the right-hand
side, the large current INa, whereas other currents are not that large and so do not have
the large coeﬃcient ǫ−

1 in front of them.

3. The fast sodium current INa is only large during the upstroke of the AP, and not that
large otherwise, because either gate m or gate h or both are almost closed outside the
upstroke since their quasistationary values m(V ) and h(V ) are small there. Thus in the
0, functions m(V ) and h(V ) have to be considered zero in certain overlapping

∂X V in the ﬁrst equation represents the eﬀect of the front curvature for waves
propagating in two or three spatial dimensions. Derivation of this term using asymptotic
arguments can be found e.g. in [16]. A simple rule-of-thumb way to understand it is this.
Imagine a circular wave in two spatial dimensions. The diﬀusion term in the equation for
R + 1
∂2
V then has the form D
V = D
V where R is the polar radius. If R
at the front is large, its instant curvature
= 1/R changes slowly as the front propagates,
and can be replaced with a constant for long time intervals. Considering R as a new X

In other words, we consider the fast time scale on which the upstroke of the AP happens, neglect
the variations of slow variables during this period as well as all transmembrane currents except
INa, as they do not make signiﬁcant contribution during this period and replace m and h with
zero when they are small.

In the resulting Eqs. 3 the ﬁrst three equations for V , m and h form a closed subsystem, the
following four equations for ua, w, oa and d, can be solved if V (x, t) is known but do not aﬀect its
dynamics, and the rest of the equations state that all other variables remain unchanged. Hence
we concentrate on the ﬁrst three equations as the system describing propagation of an AP front
or its failure. The above derivation procedure does not give a precise deﬁnition of the functions
H(V ) and M (V ), it only requires that these are reasonably close to h(V ) and m(V ) for those
values of V where these functions are not small. Here ‘reasonably close’ means that replacement
Vm) does not change signiﬁcantly the
of h(V ) with H(V ) θ(Vh −
solutions of interest, i.e. the propagating fronts. We have found that the simplest approximation
in the form M (V ) = 1, H(V ) = 1 works well enough. This is demonstrated in table 1 where
various choices of M (V ) and H(V ) are tested. So, ultimately, we consider the following system

All parameters and functions here are deﬁned as in [6] except the new ‘gate threshold’ parameters
Vh and Vm which are chosen from the conditions h(Vh) = 1/2 and m3(Vm) = 1/2. As follows
from the derivation, variable j, the slow inactivation gate of the fast sodium current, acts as a
parameter of the model. It is the only one of all slow variables included in the vector U that
aﬀects our fast subsystem. We say that it describes the ‘excitability’ of the tissue. Notice that
it is a multiplier of gN a, so a reduced availability of the fast sodium channels, e.g. as under TTX
or arguably in Brugada syndrome, can be described by a reduced value of the parameter j.

Before proceeding to the analysis of the simpliﬁed three-variable model deﬁned by Eqs. 4 we
wish to demonstrate that it is a good approximation of the full model of [6] both on a qualitative
and a quantitative level. On the qualitative level, we show that a temporary obstacle leads to

Conditions for propagation and block

a dissipation of the front. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 which shows propagation of the AP into
a region in time and space where the excitability of the tissue is artiﬁcially suppressed. The
sharp wave fronts of the model of Courtemanche et al. [6] as well as of Eqs. 4 stop to propagate
and start to spread diﬀusively once they reach the blocked zone. The propagation does not
resume after the block is removed. This behaviour is completely diﬀerent from that of the
FitzHugh-Nagumo system of Eqs. 1 in which even though the propagation is blocked for nearly
the whole duration of the AP, the wave resumes once the block is removed. Table 1 illustrates,
on the quantitative level, the accuracy of Eqs. 4 as an approximation of the full model of [6].

It is a popular concept going back to classical works [e.g. 25] that the fast activation gate
m is considered a ‘fast variable’ and is ‘adiabatically eliminated’ since most of the time, except
m(V ). Hence
possibly during a very short transient, it is close to its quasistationary value m
the model can be simpliﬁed by replacing m with m(V ) and eliminating the equation for m,

We have explored this possibility for the model of Courtemanche et al. [6] in [23]. Eqs. 6 are
qualitatively correct, i.e. they still show front dissipation on collision with a temporary obstacle,
but make a large error in the front propagation speed, as demonstrated in table 1.

2.2 Travelling waves and reduction to ODE

To ﬁnd out when propagation of excitation is possible in our simpliﬁed model and when it will
be blocked, we study solutions in the form of propagating fronts as well as the conditions of
existence of such solutions.

We look for solutions in the form of a front propagating with a constant speed and shape.
So we use the ansatz F (z) = F (x + ct) for F = V, h, m where z = x + ct is a ‘travelling wave
coordinate’ and c is the dimensionless wave speed of the front, related to the dimensional speed
C by c = (ǫ/D)1/2C. Then Eqs. 4 reduce to a system of autonomous ordinary diﬀerential
equations,

Here Vα and Vω are the pre- and post-front voltages.

Eqs. 7 represent a system of fourth order so its general solution depends on four arbitrary
constants. Together with constants Vα, Vω and c this makes seven constants to be determined
from the six boundary conditions in Eqs. 8. Thus, we should have a one-parametric family
of solutions, i.e. one of the parameters (Vα, Vω, c) can be chosen arbitrary from a certain
range. A natural choice is Vα because the pre-front voltage acts as an initial condition for a
propagating front in the tissue, and because in our study of the conditions for propagation it is

most conveniently treated as a parameter rather than as an unknown.

3 Analytical study of the reduced model

3.1 An exactly solvable caricature model

The parameter-counting arguments given in the previous section make it plausible that the
problem deﬁned by Eqs. 7 with boundary conditions of Eqs. 8 has a one-parametric family of
travelling wave-front solutions. However, the problem is posed in a highly unusual way since
the asymptotic pre-front and post-front states are not stable isolated equilibria but belong to
continua of equilibria and thus are only neutrally stable. We are not aware of any general
theorems that would guarantee existence of solutions of a nonlinear boundary value-eigenvalue
problem of this kind. For the two-component model of Eqs. 6 considered in [23] this worry has
been alleviated by the fact that there is a ‘caricature’ model which has the same structure as
Eqs. 6 including the structure and stability of the equilibrium set and which admits an exact
and exhaustive analytical study [19]. Fortunately, a similar ‘caricature’ exists for our present
three-variable problem as well. We replace functions INa(V ), τh(V ) and τm(V ) deﬁned in Eqs. 5
with constants. The choice of the constants is somewhat arbitrary. We assume that the events
in the beginning of the interval z
), where V is just above Vm, are most important for
the front propagation. So for numerical illustrations we choose the values of constants INa, τh
and τm as the values of the corresponding functions in Eqs. 5 at V = Vm. We set the z axis so
that V (0) = Vh, and then V (ξ) = Vm for some ξ > 0 still to be determined. We demand that
the solutions for the unknowns V , h and m are continuous and that V is smooth at the internal
boundary points.

The accurate expression in Eq. 5a for the sodium current INa(V ) vanishes for V = VN a
which, in particular, means that the transmembrane voltage never exceeds VN a. So, replacing
this function with a constant changes the properties of the system qualitatively. Even bigger
discrepancies are expected to occur from replacing the τh(V ) and τm(V ) by constants because
these functions vary by an order of magnitude in the range between the pre- and the post-front
voltage. It is surprising, however, that even this rough approximation produces results which,
with exception of the post-front voltage, are within several percent from the solution of the
detailed ionic model [6] and certainly capture its qualitative features as can be seen in Fig. 2.
Figure 2 also shows, for comparison, the numerical solutions of the full three-variable model of
Eqs. 7, which will be described in detail in the next section, and of the detailed ionic model of
[6]. Values of c for various choices of j can be obtained from Fig. 3.

3.2 The condition of propagation

Equation 10b deﬁnes c as a smooth function of the parameters within a certain domain. The
boundary of this domain is associated with the propagation failure. Not all parameters, INa,
τh, τm, κ, Vα and j, entering Eq. 10b are of equal importance. We consider here κ = 0 and
postpone the investigation of the eﬀects of curvature to the next section. Parameters INa, τh and
τm represent well-deﬁned properties of the tissue, albeit changeable depending on physiological
conditions. On the other hand, parameters j and Vα are not model constants, but ‘slowly
varying’ dynamic quantities: j remains approximately constant throughout the front, and Vα
represents the transmembrane voltage ahead of the front, but both can vary widely on large
scales between diﬀerent fronts. Hence we need to determine the singular points of the dispersion
relation in Eq. 10b with respect to j and Vα.

Similarly to the two-component caricature [19], Eq. 10b is a transcendental equation for c,

but it is easily solvable for the excitation parameter j:

The resulting relationship of j and c for a selected value of Vα is shown in Fig. 3. This ﬁgure
reveals a bifurcation. For values of j lower than some jmin no travelling wave solutions exist.
After a bifurcation at j > jmin two solutions with diﬀerent speeds are possible. Our direct
numerical simulations of Eqs. 4 as well as studies of the two-component caricature model by
Hinch [27] suggest that the solutions of the lower branch are unstable. The bifurcation point
jmin can be determined from the condition that j has a minimum with respect to c at this point

This limit corresponds to the two-variable caricature [19]. For any given value of the pre-

Although lacking suﬃcient accuracy, the zeroth-order approximation given by Eq. 16 reproduces
qualitatively well the conditions for propagation and dissipation of excitation fronts in the model
of Courtemanche et al. [6]. Analogously, discarding the small terms of order O(τ 2

4 Numerical results

4.1 Propagating front solutions

We solved Eqs. 7–8 numerically, using the method described in Appendix A. The results are
shown in ﬁgures 2, 3 and 5. Figure 2 oﬀers a comparison of the shapes of the solution of Eqs. 7
with a snapshot of a travelling wave solution of the full model of Courtemanche et al. [6]. The
values of the wave speed and the post-front voltage are presented in table 1 and also show an
excellent agreement. This conﬁrms our assumptions that the fronts of travelling waves in the
full model have constant speed and shape and thus satisfy an ODE system, and that j remains
approximately constant during the front. Figure 5 shows the wave speed c as a function of two
of the parameters of the problem, the pre-front voltage Vα and the excitability parameter j. For
every value of j and Vα from a certain domain, two values of the wave speed c are possible, which
is similar to the solutions of the caricature model. The smaller values of c are not observed in
the PDE simulation of the full model. This is a strong indication that they are unstable.

4.2 The condition of propagation

In this subsection, we report numerical values for the threshold of excitability jmin below which
wave fronts are not sustainable and have to dissipate, as predicted by the reduced three-variable
model of Eqs. 7–8. Figure 6 presents jmin as a function of the pre-front voltage Vα. This ﬁgure
also shows a projection of a selected set of AP trajectories. The AP solutions were obtained for
a space-clamped version of the model of Courtemanche et al. [6] with initial conditions for j and
V as shown in the ﬁgure and all other variables in their resting states. These trajectories allow
us to follow the correlation between the transient of the slow inactivation gating variable of the
sodium current j and the AP V . Notice that in the tail of an AP solution, the dependence
j vs V is almost independent of the way the AP is initiated. As a result, the projections of
the trajectories (V (t), j(t)) intersect the critical curve (Vα, jmin(Vα)) in a small vicinity of one
0.5). This result suggests the following interpretation.

4.3 Propagation block in two dimensions

In two spatial dimensions, the condition of dissipation j < j
may happen to a piece of a wave
∗
front rather than the whole of it. In that case we observe a local block and a break-up of the
excitation wave. Figure 7 shows how it happens in a two-dimensional simulation of the detailed
model of Courtemanche et al. [6]. A spiral wave was initiated by a cross-ﬁeld protocol. This
spiral wave develops instability, breaks up from time to time, and eventually self-terminates.
This is one of the simulations discussed in detail in [23]. Here we use it to test our newly
obtained criterion of propagation block. The red colour component represents the V ﬁeld, black
for the resting state and maximum for the AP peak. This is superimposed onto an all-or-none
representation of the j ﬁeld, with black for j > j
. Thus the red rim
∗
represents the ‘active front’ zone where excitation has already happened but j gates are not de-
activated yet; most of the excited region is in shades of purple representing the gradual decay of
the AP with j deactivated. The wave ends up with a blue tail, which corresponds to V already
. So the blue zone is
close to the resting potential but j not yet recovered and still below j
∗
where there is no excitation, but propagation of excitation wave is impossible, i.e. absolutely
refractory zone. The black zone after the tail and before the new front is therefore relative
refractory zone, where front propagation is possible. Thus, in terms of the colour coding of
ﬁgure 7, the prediction of the theory is: the wavefront will be blocked and dissipate where and
when it reaches the blue zone, and only there and then. This is exactly what happens in the
shown panels: the red front touches the blue tail, ﬁrst at the third panel, at the point indicated
by the white arrow, and subsequently in its vicinity. The excitation front stops in that vicinity
and dissipates. So we have a break-up of the front.

The analysis of the numerics, which ran for the total of 7400 ms until self-termination of
the spiral and showed 4 episodes of front break-up, has conﬁrmed that in all cases the break-up
happened if and only if the front reached the blue region j

4.4 Curvature eﬀects

Since we attempt to compare the results of our one-dimensional model to simulations of spiral
waves in two-dimensions, it is important to explore the dependence of the solution on the
curvature of the front. The standard theory says that in two dimensions the normal velocity of

Conditions for propagation and block

11

K

the wave front need to be corrected by the term λ
where λ is the typical width of the wave front
[16]. The speed-curvature diagram presented in Fig. 8(a) shows that in our simpliﬁed model
this relationship is satisﬁed to rather large values of
. Our choice of boundary conditions in
Eqs. 8 assumes that the excitation fronts propagate from right to left, so positive values of the
curvature correspond to concave fronts. Only at very small values of the radius of curvature of
the order of 0.3 mm for j = 1 the wave speed shows a non-linear dependence on curvature as
seen in the insert Fig. 8(b). This part of the ﬁgure also demonstrates that there is a critical
value of the curvature for which the excitation wave stops to propagate as well as an unstable
branch of the solution. However, these phenomena occur at very large curvatures which are far
outside of the range of values observed in the two-dimensional simulations of Fig. 7.

|K|

The most important question with respect to our study is whether the curvature changes
signiﬁcantly the critical value of the excitation parameter j
below which the wave fronts fail
∗
to propagate. To answer this question we present Fig. 8(c) in which the wave speed c is shown
as a function of j for three values of the curvature corresponding to a non-curved front and to
convex and concave fronts with radius of curvature equal to 10 mm. The values of jmin for these
three cases diﬀer only slightly. So, the propagation blocks in our simulations do not depend
signiﬁcantly on the curvature of the front.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we have shown that propagation of excitation and its block in Courtemanche
et al. [6] model of human atrial tissue can be successfully predicted by a simpliﬁed model of the
excitation front, obtained by an asymptotic description focussed on the fast sodium current,
INa. Whereas it was known that main qualitative features of the INa-driven fronts can be
described by a two-component model for V and h, we have now found that for good quantitative
predictions, one must also take into account the dynamics of m gates. Thus, we have proposed
a three-component description of the propagating excitation fronts given by Eqs. 4. We have
obtained an exact analytical solution for piecewise-linear ‘caricature’ three-component model of
Eqs. 4. For an appropriate choice of parameters, it reproduces the key qualitative features of the
accurate three-component model of Eqs. 4 and gives a correct order of magnitude quantitatively.
Numerical solution of the automodel equation of the proposed three-component model of Eqs. 4
gives a very accurate prediction of propagation block in two-dimensional re-entrant waves. For
the given model, this reduces to a condition involving the pre-front values of V and j, or even in
terms of j alone. This provides the sought-for operational deﬁnition of absolute refractoriness
in terms of j, simple and eﬃcient.

The success of the propagation block prediction justiﬁes the assumptions made on the asymp-
totic structure, i.e. appearance of the small parameter ǫ, of Eqs. 2, and also conﬁrms that
two-dimensional eﬀects, e.g. front curvature, do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the propagation block
conditions, at least in the particular simulation.

As description and role of INa are fairly universal in cardiac models, most of the results
should be applicable to other models. However, some other cardiac models may require a more
complicated description. For instance, the contemporary ‘Markovian’ description of INa [28,
e.g. ] is very diﬀerent from the classical m3jh scheme. Also, propagation in ventricular tissue
in certain circumstances can be essentially supported by L-type calcium current rather than
mostly INa alone [29].

We use the boundary-value problem solver D02RAF of the NAG numerical library which employs a ﬁnite-

The method proves to be very robust over a large range of parameters.

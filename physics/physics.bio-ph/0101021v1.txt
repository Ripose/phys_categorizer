Abstract
We study the evolution of large but ﬁnite asexual populations evolving
in ﬁtness landscapes in which all mutations are either neutral or strongly
deleterious. We demonstrate that despite the absence of higher ﬁtness
genotypes, adaptation takes place as regions with more advantageous dis-
tributions of neutral genotypes are discovered. Since these discoveries are
typically rare events, the population dynamics can be subdivided into sep-
arate epochs, with rapid transitions between them. Within one epoch, the
average ﬁtness in the population is approximately constant. The transi-
tions between epochs, however, are generally accompanied by a signiﬁcant
increase in the average ﬁtness. We verify our theoretical considerations
with two analytically tractable bitstring models.

1. Introduction

Sudden bursts of adaptive activity which punctuate long periods of stagnancy
seem to be a common observation in evolving systems. Such epochal evolution
[van Nimwegen et al., 1997], has been found in the fossil record [Eldredge and
Gould, 1972, Gould and Eldredge, 1977], in evolving bacteria [Lenski and Trav-
isano, 1994, Elena et al., 1996], the evolution of tRNA structures [Huynen et al.,
1996, Fontana and Schuster, 1998] or artiﬁcial systems such as digital organ-
isms [Adami, 1995] and evolutionary optimization [Vose and Liepins, 1991, van
Nimwegen et al., 1997]. The most complete theoretical analysis of epochal evo-
lution has probably been presented in a series of papers by van Nimwegen and
coworkers [van Nimwegen et al., 1997, 1999b, van Nimwegen and Crutchﬁeld,
2000a,b]. The general picture is as follows. A population can easily climb to
the nearest local optimum, but escape from there only with diﬃculty. Once a
local optimum has been reached, the population is trapped and experiences a
metastable equilibrium. With a relatively low probability, the population can
discover a portal genotype leading to the next local optimum, i.e., a genotype

1

C. O. Wilke: Adaptive evolution on neutral networks

with a higher ﬁtness than what is currently present in the population. Once a
portal is discovered, the population moves quickly away from its current peak,
and towards the new peak. There, it settles down again in equilibrium, until the
next portal is discovered.

The above description focuses on the dynamics between local optima, but not
on the dynamics at one local optimum. However, in the presence of neutrality,
i.e., when a number of genotypes share the same identical replication rate, the
dynamics around one local optimum can be quite intriguing. A population does
not drift over a set of neutral genotypes, like a set of random walkers, but has
a quite diﬀerent, even to some extent deterministic dynamics. In a completely
ﬂat ﬁtness landscape, for example, a population does not assume a Gaussian
distribution with a variance that increases over time, as would be expected from
a simple diﬀusion process. Rather, the population stays clustered together and
the cluster moves about as a whole [Derrida and Peliti, 1991]. If neutral and
deleterious genotypes are mixed, i.e., if each genotype has as direct neighbors
in genotype space both neutral and deleterious genotypes, then the population
moves to the regions of the most connected neutral genotypes, as long as the
mutation rate is small [van Nimwegen et al., 1999a].

In this paper, we study the dynamics of a ﬁnite but large population of asex-
ually replicating genetic sequences on a ﬁtness landscape that contains both
neutral and strongly deleterious genotypes. We show that the neutral genotypes
naturally decompose into disjunct sets, and that an evolving population can be
trapped within such sets. Moreover, diﬀerent sets yield diﬀerent reproductive
success for the populations residing on them. When a population discovers a set
of genotypes with higher reproductive success, the population moves over to that
set. For the average ﬁtness of the population, such transitions are reﬂected in a
stepwise increase, exactly as it is observed in standard scenarios of epochal evo-
lution. However, the increase observed here is not due to the discovery of faster
replicating genotypes, but solely to the discovery of genotypes with increased
robustness against mutations. Our results are valid for arbitrary mutation rates,
and they generalize the previous ﬁndings of van Nimwegen et al. [1999a].

2. Theory

We assume that there exist two classes of genotypes, those with a relatively high
replication rate σ, and the ones with a much lower replication rate. For reasons
of simplicity, we assume the latter to have replication rate 0. This assumption
is quite common in the literature [Gavrilets, 1997, 1999, van Nimwegen et al.,
1999a]. Our analysis is similar to the standard treatment of the quasispecies
model (see for example Schuster and Swetina [1988], Eigen et al. [1988, 1989],
Wilke et al. [2001]) and to the work of van Nimwegen et al. [1999b,a]. Let the
vector a deﬁne the set of neutral genotypes, i.e., the genotypes with replication

if i has replication rate σ,
else,

ai =

(cid:26)

where i runs over all possible genotypes. We assume a discrete time model,
and write the average population ﬁtness as
. In equilibrium, we have [van
Nimwegen et al., 1999b]

where x is the vector of concentrations, the diagonal matrix A = diag(a0, a1, . . . )
contains the set of neutral genotypes, and the matrix Q deﬁnes the mutation
probabilities between diﬀerent genotypes, i.e., genotype j mutates into genotype
i with probability Qij.

h

In the following, we assume that the genotypes can be represented as sequences
of length l over an alphabet of A diﬀerent symbols. Moreover, we assume a
uniform copy ﬁdelity q per symbol. That means, the l symbols in a sequence
mutate independently from each other, and the substitution probability in one
q for each symbol. With this assumption, the mutation matrix
generation is 1

It is useful to introduce the matrices

G(k) = AD(k)A .

These matrices deﬁne the connection graphs at Hamming distance k for the neu-
tral genotypes. We now disregard all non-neutral sequences, and introduce the
concentration vector p, which holds the concentrations of all neutral sequences.
The total number of neutral sequences is then P =
i pi. Moreover, we assume
all columns and rows corresponding to non-neutral sequences to be deleted from
the matrices G(k). From equation (7), we obtain the eigenvalue equation

In the following, we will call matrices such as G generalized connection matrices.
The diﬀerence to the normal connection matrices G(k) as deﬁned in equation (8)
is that generalized connection matrices may contain powers of ˜µ, i.e., they deﬁne
a connection graph with weighted edges, whereas for the graphs deﬁned by G(k),
all edges have the same weight.

In that case, the equilibrium distribution p depends solely on the one-mutant
connections of the neutral sequences, and the population neutrality
is
given by the spectral radius of the ﬁrst-order connection matrix. Equation (17)
corresponds to the result of van Nimwegen et al. [1999a]. Thus, we ﬁnd that
equation (16) is the generalization of that result to arbitrary mutation rates. For
larger mutation rates, the equilibrium distribution is inﬂuenced by the higher
order connection matrices, and the population neutrality may deviate from the
spectral radius of G(1).

2.1. Separate neutral networks

Following the conventional nomenclature in the literature [Forst et al., 1995], we
call a set of neutral sequences that can be transversed by one-point mutations
a neutral network. The full set of neutral sequences in genotype space will in
general decompose into several disjunct such neutral networks. Assume there

are n disjunct neutral networks. By reordering sequences, we can arrange G in
block-matrix form

where the matrices Gi are the generalized connection matrices for the diﬀerent
neutral networks, and all oﬀ-diagonal terms are at least of the order of ˜µ. Let
us further assume that the matrices Gi are ordered with descending spectral
radius, i.e., the spectral radius of Gi is larger than the one of Gi+1 for all i.
For a ﬁnite population initially residing on network n, we can then expect the
following dynamics. If the mutation rate is small, the population will equilibrate
within network n. The discovery of a sequence that is part of a neutral network
i < n is very unlikely, due to the small oﬀ-diagonal terms. However, eventually
such a sequence will be discovered. Since a progeny of that sequence has a smaller
probability to fall oﬀ its neutral network (Gi has a larger spectral radius than
Gn), the sequences on network i will have a higher reproductive success than
the sequences on network n, and the population will move over to the newly
discovered network. There, the population will equilibrate, until the next higher-
connected network is discovered. If the mutation rate is large, on the other hand,
the oﬀ-diagonal terms cannot be considered small anymore. In that case, the
discovery of higher connected regions is much more likely, and a population will
move straight away into the more densely connected regions of the genotype
space. In Sec. 4, we present examples for both of these behaviors.

The above considerations show that the decomposition of the full set of neutral
sequences into neutral networks according to the deﬁnition given at the begin-
ning of this subsection is somewhat arbitrary. Depending on the mutation rate, it
(˜µ2) to the
might be justiﬁed, for example, to disregard contributions of order
matrix G, but not the ones of order
(˜µ). In that case, it would be more natural
to group the sequences into sets that can be transversed by a combination of
one- or two-point mutations. In general, the neutral sequences should therefore
be subdivided into sets such that two arbitrary sequences of two disjunct sets are
at least a Hamming distance k apart, where k represents the smallest number
of simultaneous mutations that can be considered rare at the respective muta-
tion rate. For the remainder of this paper, we will understand the term neutral
network in this more general sense.

3. A simple exactly solvable landscape

In this section, we study a simple example landscape for which the matrix G
can be diagonalized exactly, to all orders in ˜µ. We consider binary sequences

C. O. Wilke: Adaptive evolution on neutral networks

7

of length l = 2n, and break them down into n pairs of bits. For each pair, we
assume that there are three states (00, 01, 10) which are neutral, and one state
(11) which is lethal. Therefore, a sequence which contains at least one pair for
which both bits are set to 1 has a ﬁtness of 0, and all other sequences have a
ﬁtness of σ. For simplicity, we set σ = 1. We will refer to this landscape as the
Neutral Bitpairs landscape.

For a single pair, the matrix G1 reads (in this section, the subscript i in Gi

indicates the number of pairs we are considering)

G1 =

and its largest eigenvalue is λ1 = (˜µ +
the corresponding matrix G2 can be written as a tensor product (see Rumschitzki

[1987], Dress and Rumschitzki [1988], Wilke [1999]),

The symbol 1 stands for the identity matrix in the appropriate matrix space.
In general, for a sequence consisting of n pairs, we can deﬁne the matrix Gn
recursively,

Gn = ˜µ−1 [(1 + ˜µG1)

(1 + ˜µGn−1)

1] .

⊗

As a consequence, the largest eigenvalue of Gn reads

λn = ˜µ−1[(1 + ˜µλ1)n

genomic mutation rate µ. For comparison, we have also displayed results from
numerical simulations with a genetic algorithm. As was to be expected, the
approximation works well for µ
1, but breaks down for higher mutation
rates. For µ & 1, the approximation signiﬁcantly underestimates the average
population ﬁtness. Interestingly, this goes along with a decrease in the population
neutrality (Fig. 1b). What happens is the following. In general, a population
moves to that region of the genotype space where the probability of neutral
oﬀspring is maximized for the given mutation rate. Clearly, when the mutation
rate is low, only the immediate neighbors inﬂuence that probability. If, however,
the mutation rate is high, such that oﬀspring with two or even more mutations
become common, the immediate neighbors lose their importance. In the extreme
case of a per symbol copy ﬁdelity of q = 0.5, the probability of giving birth to a
viable sequence becomes identical for all sequences. Hence, in that extreme we
can expect the population neutrality to coincide with the network neutrality ν
(the network neutrality is the average number of neutral neighbors of a viable
sequence), which amounts to ν = 2
3l in our case. At the same time, most of
the average population ﬁtness does not stem from the one-mutants anymore,
but from mutants further away, which explains why the approximation equation
(26) underestimates the true average ﬁtness.

4. The Neutral Staircase landscape

The ﬁtness landscape that we have studied in the previous section contains only a
single large neutral network, and hence epochal dynamics as predicted in Sec. 2.1
cannot be observed in that landscape. However, with a small modiﬁcation, we
can create a landscape that possesses the required properties. We subdivide a
binary sequence into b blocks of length 2n, with a set of k bits in between each
block (Fig. 2). The total length of the sequence is thus l = 2bn + k(b
1). The
blocks can be active or inactive. An active block has properties similar to the
sequences of the previous section. The block is subdivided into n pairs. If any of
those n pairs are in the conﬁguration 11, the ﬁtness of the whole sequence is zero.
Otherwise, the ﬁtness is not aﬀected by that block. The rightmost block is always
active. A block further to the left becomes active if the block immediately to its
right is active, and all k bits between the two blocks are set to 1. Finally, any
bit to the left of the leftmost active block that is set to 1 results in ﬁtness zero
for the whole sequence. We call this landscape the Neutral Staircase landscape,
in analogy to the Royal Staircase introduced by van Nimwegen and Crutchﬁeld
[2000b]. Note that the Neutral Staircase diﬀers from the Royal Staircase in an
important aspect: all sequences have either ﬁtness 0 or ﬁtness 1. No higher ﬁtness
genotypes can be discovered, and the population’s dynamics is determined only
by the topology of the neutral sequences.

−

The analytical treatment of the Neutral Staircase landscape is straightforward
for k > 1. The neutral sequences decompose into b neutral networks, one for each
possible number of blocks that can be active. Within one neutral network, the
average population ﬁtness is readily available from (23). Namely, if i counts the
number of active blocks, we have

Likewise, it is simple to derive the probability with which a new block is dis-
covered. First, we note that the probability with which an oﬀspring sequence
remains on the neutral network i is given by
, according to (11).
Hence, a single oﬀspring sequence ends up on the next neutral network with
q2 ˜µ2)n (we need k extra mutations to set the k bits

left of the leftmost active block to one, but we are allowed some miscopies in
the newly activated block). In a ﬁnite population of N sequences, there are on

Figure 3: Two example runs on a Neutral Staircase landscape. If the entropic barrier between
the neutral networks is large (a), the population moves from one network to the next in discrete
jumps. If the barrier is small (b), the population moves straight away to the network that yields
the highest average population ﬁtness. We used n = 3, b = 5, q = 0.99, and a population size
of N = 10000. In graph a, we used k = 3, and in graph b, we used k = 2.

Next, we are interested in the probability of ﬁxation of that newly discovered
sequence, πi. For large populations, πi can be approximated by 2s [Haldane,

have found good agreement. In Fig. 3, we compare the average ﬁtness in the dif-
, to the simulation results. Figure 3a shows that the population
ferent epochs,
ﬁtness ﬂuctuates around the predicted value during the metastable equilibrium,
and that transitions between two equilibria happen fast. In Fig. 3b, we have
made the entropic barrier between two networks smaller (we have reduced k).
Then, all neutral sequences actually form only a single large neutral network,
and the population transitions immediately to the highest possible level of the
average ﬁtness.

In Fig. 4, we compare the time to convergence τconv with simulation results.
We ﬁnd that for µ . 3, our analytical prediction agrees well with the simula-
tions, whereas for larger µ, the prediction fails to capture the observed behavior.
The origin of this failure is the following. We have derived equation (32) under
the assumption that it is hard to discover the next higher network. Now, when
µ becomes of the order of k (we have k = 3 in Fig. 4), mutations that ﬂip all
k bits at once to activate the next block become likely, and hence this assump-
tion fails. As in the case of Fig. 3b, the neutral sequences then form a single
gigantic network, and an expression derived under the assumption of disjunct
sub-networks must break down.

5. Discussion

The analysis presented in the preceding sections has shown that the topology
of the neutral sequences in genotype space has an important inﬂuence on the
dynamics of a population. It is therefore not justiﬁed to regard the evolution of
a population of neutral genotypes as a simple diﬀusion process, unless either the
population size or the mutation rate are very small (when the product of the
population size, N and the genomic mutation rate, µ, is much smaller than one,

C. O. Wilke: Adaptive evolution on neutral networks

12

the population as a whole performs essentially a random walk on the neutral
network [van Nimwegen et al., 1999a].) We have demonstrated that evolution on
neutral networks can lead to the same kind of epochal dynamics that previously
was thought to be caused solely by the discovery of genotypes of higher ﬁtness.
Of course, our results do not imply that sudden transitions in a population
are never caused by such discoveries. Normally, a transition that we observe in a
population evolving in an unknown ﬁtness landscape will be due to the discovery
of a faster replicating genotype. However, sometimes we may observe a transition
to a higher average ﬁtness without an increase (or even with a decrease, see
below) in the ﬁtness of the dominant or fastest replicating genotype. Such a
transition is then due to the eﬀects described in this paper.

In most cases, selection acts ﬁrst and foremost on replication rates. However,
if all viable genotypes are identical in terms of their replication rate, as is the
case in the ﬁtness landscapes we have studied in this paper, the next important
quantity selection acts upon is the probability with which genotypes have viable
oﬀspring. This probability is more a property of a set of genotypes than of a single
genotype, because a genotype that itself has high reproductive success, but pro-
duces mainly oﬀspring with poor reproductive success, will ultimately have only
a small number of progeny. Therefore, the selective pressure we have described
here acts solely on clouds of mutants, in an extreme form of quasispecies-like
selection [Eigen and Schuster, 1979, Nowak, 1992].

Throughout this paper, we have assumed that all sequences have the same
replication rate σ. It is natural to ask what happens when sequences with dif-
ferent replication rates are present. The simplest such situation occurs when all
sequences within a single neutral network i have the same replication rate σi.
In that case, we can take the analysis given in Sec. 2.1 one step further. The
equilibrium ﬁtness

within a network i is then given by

fii

h

= σiql(1 + ˜µρi) ,

fii

h

(33)

where ρi is the spectral radius of the connection matrix of the network, Gi. A
population will of course try to move to the particular network that gives the
maximum equilibrium ﬁtness. For a small mutation rate ˜µ, it is clear that the
network with the largest σi yields the maximum equilibrium ﬁtness. If, however,
the mutation rate is large, such that ˜µρi becomes of the order of unity or even
exceeds that value, then depending on the distribution of the ρi’s and the σi’s
over the diﬀerent networks, a population may actually transition from a network
j with a higher replication rate σj to a network i with a smaller replication rate
σi, while at the same time increasing its average ﬁtness. A similar eﬀect was
already predicted by Schuster and Swetina [1988], although they investigated
peaks with diﬀerent support from slightly deleterious mutations, rather than
neutral networks with diﬀerent connection densities. In recent work, Ofria et al.
[2000] have observed this selection for neutrality empirically in digital organisms.
In a large number of evolution experiments with diﬀerent mutation rates, they

C. O. Wilke: Adaptive evolution on neutral networks

13

observed that the number of neutral neighbors of the dominant genotype (a
crude but practical measure for the spectral radius of the connection matrix)
would increase at higher mutation rates, at the expense of the digital organisms’
replication rate. Similarly, Wilke et al. [2000] showed that digital organisms with
a vastly inferior replication rate could outcompete seemingly superior digital
organisms at high mutation rates if the slower replicating organisms had a higher
robustness against mutations.

It is interesting to relate our results for the average population ﬁtness to the
mutational load L, which is deﬁned as [Haldane, 1937, Muller, 1950, Crow, 1970]

where ρ is the spectral radius of the connection matrix G. As was already noted
by van Nimwegen et al. [1999a], the load can deviate signiﬁcantly from Haldane’s
result L = µ [Haldane, 1937] if neutrality is present [note that equation (35)
becomes identical to Haldane’s result in the absence of neutrality (ρ = 0) and
in the limit of a small mutation rate]. More importantly, as a generalization of
Haldane’s result, it is often cited that the genetic load in an asexual population
is independent of the ﬁtness landscape, and therefore also of epistasis, and that
it is equal to

L = 1

(see e.g. Kondrashov [1988], Charlesworth [1990], derivation given by Kimura and
Maruyama [1966], Crow [1970]). This result, however, holds only in the absence of
neutral mutants. If neutral mutants are present, then the topology of the neutral
genotypes in the genotype space is coupled to the mutational load, by virtue of
ρ in equation (35). Since the topology is also coupled to the type of epistasis
that we observe [Wilke and Adami, 2000], epistasis must have an inﬂuence on
the mutational load, even in asexual populations, as long as neutral mutations
can occur. However, equation (36) is the basis of the deterministic mutational
hypothesis of the evolution of sex [Kondrashov, 1988]: if the mutational load is
independent of epistasis for asexual populations, but depends strongly on the
sign of epistasis for sexual populations, then for certain types of epistasis the
mutational load of a sexual population may be much smaller than that of an
asexual population. Because of the diﬀerences between equations (35) and (36),
the deterministic mutational hypothesis could break down if neutrality were
taken into account. As a consequence, this hypothesis should be reconsidered for
the case of landscapes with neutrality.

6. Conclusions

We have shown that adaptive evolution can take place in the complete absence
of what is ordinarily understood as advantageous genotypes. Even if the ﬁtnesses
of all viable genotypes are completely identical does selection favor particular
regions of genotype space over others. What makes the diﬀerence is the den-
sity of neutral sequences. In a region of genotype space with a higher density of
neutral sequences, chances are higher that a mutated oﬀspring is neutral rather
than deleterious. Therefore, neutral sequences in such a region have a higher ro-
bustness against mutation, and hence a higher reproductive success. This gives
them suﬃcient selective advantage to outcompete sequences from a less densely
connected region. The transitions between diﬀerent such regions will often oc-
cur in sudden jumps, followed by relatively long periods of stasis. Evolution on
neutral networks alone can thus lead to epochal dynamics observed in so many
natural and artiﬁcial evolving systems.

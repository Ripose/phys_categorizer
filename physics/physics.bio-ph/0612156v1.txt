Loss of Cell-Substrate Adhesion Leads to Periodic Shape Oscillations in
Fibroblasts

(Dated: December 16, 2013)

We report the phenomenon of periodic shape oscillations occurring in 3T3 ﬁbroblasts merely as
a consequence of a loss of cell-substrate adhesion. The oscillatory behavior can last many hours at
a constant frequency, and can be switched oﬀ and on using chemical agents. This robustness allows
for the extraction of quantitative data using single cells. We demonstrate that the frequency of
oscillations increases with increasing actomyosin contractility. Both the Myosin Light Chain Kinase
as well as the Rho Kinase pathways are shown to operate during this process. Further, we reveal
signiﬁcant similarities between the oscillatory dynamics and the commonly observed phenomenon
of blebbing. We show that both these processes ceases when extracellular calcium is depleted or
when stretch activated calcium channels are blocked. This, along with the fact that these dynamical
processes require actomyosin contactility points towards strong similarities in the respective mech-
anisms. Finally, we speculate on a possible mechanism for the observed dynamical phenomena.

INTRODUCTION

The cell cytoskeleton is a biopolymer gel capable of generating active contractile forces and rapid
reorganization [1, 2]. These properties are critical for the ability of these ﬁlament networks, espe-
cially the actomyosin gel, in controlling cell shape and vital functions like locomotion, cytokinesis,
mechanotransduction, etc [1, 2]. The active remodeling of the cytoskeleton during such dynamical
processes involves complex signal transduction pathways which include mechano-chemical cou-
pling. Of the myriad of functions the cytoskeleton performs in cells, oscillatory dynamics observed
in certain cell types are of particular interest to biologists and physicists alike. Cells like car-
diomyocytes and asynchronous insect muscle cells have evolved to generate rhythmic contractile
forces
[3, 4, 5, 6]. It is also known that certain non-oscillatory cells can be induced to exhibit
oscillatory behavior by biochemical intervention. Examples are shape oscillations occurring in
lymphoblasts, spreading ﬁbroblasts and in cell fragments, as a result of microtubule depolymer-
[7, 8, 9]. Shape oscillations are also observed in neutrophils and amoeboid
ization using drugs
cells, usually when exposed to chemoattractants
[10, 11] and in the lamellipodea of spreading
cells [12, 13]. Recently, spontaneous oscillations of isolated myoﬁbrils lacking regulatory proteins
have been observed and theoretically studied [5, 14]. Although oscillatory dynamics in simpler
systems like beating ﬂagella are well explained by physical models [6, 15], gaining a theoretical
understanding of the dynamics of actomyosin gel is far more complicated and several aspects are
still a challenge, despite considerable progress in the ﬁeld [5, 16, 17, 18, 19].

In this article, we report the observation of oscillatory shape dynamics in freely suspended Swiss-
3T3 ﬁbroblasts, without any treatment using drugs. Remarkably, this phenomenon arises merely
as a result of loss of cell-substrate adhesion. By maintaining the cells in suspension, we are able to
show that the frequency of oscillation can remain constant for several hours allowing quantitative
measurements. We show that the frequency is decreased when myosin motor activity is reduced
using drugs. Both the Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK) and the Rho kinase pathways play a
role in the myosin activation process. Further, we show that a small minimum level of extracellular
calcium is essential for oscillations and that this calcium enters the cell via mechanosensitive cal-
cium channels. Later, we compare the oscillatory dynamics with the commonly observed blebbing
dynamics and reveal some striking similarities between these two seemingly diﬀerent phenomena.

As detachment from the surface is enough to trigger oscillations, we conclude that this dynam-
ics constitute a fundamental response of the cortical actomyosin gel in these cells and may occur
under physiological conditions. Finally, we speculate on possible mechanisms for the observed
phenomena.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Swiss-3T3 ﬁbroblasts were obtained from DSMZ Germany [20] and cultured following a standard
protocol. The adherent cells, grown to 50% to 80% conﬂuence in plastic cell culture ﬂasks were
washed with HBSS devoid of Ca++ and Mg++ and then treated with a minimal amount of 0.25%
Trypsin solution for less than 5 minutes in order to detach them from the cell culture ﬂask. In
other cases, mitotic cells were detached by gentle shake-oﬀ, without the use of Trypsin. The cells
were immediately transferred to a petri dish with a glass coverslip bottom and Iscove (IMDM)
cell culture medium with 25 mM HEPES buﬀer and 10% heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum.
All cell culture reagents were obtained from Gibco-Invitrogen. Observations were made using a
Zeiss Axiovert-135 microscope conﬁgured for phase-contrast observation. The temperature was
controlled using a home-built temperature controller within ±0.1 ◦C.

Hydrophobic surfaces which inhibit cell-substrate adhesion were obtained by coating clean glass
coverslips with dimethyldichlorosilane by evaporation and subsequent rinsing using ethanol.
In
other cases a clean glass coverslip was used to study the eﬀect of cell spreading on oscillatory
behavior. Since the cells were held in suspension in most experiments, we maintained a small
upward temperature gradient of about 0.1 ◦C/mm in the petridish using diﬀerential heating in
order to avoid convective instabilities. This gradient did not have any observable eﬀect on the
oscillations.

The images of the shape changes occurring in the ﬁbroblasts were recorded using a Spot-RT
CCD camera (Diagnostic instruments Inc). The 2-dimensional projections were analyzed using a
home-developed image analysis program. Typically, the bright edges in the phase contrast images
were detected by applying an intensity thresholding. Either the enclosed area or the position of the
centroid was used to measure the frequency of oscillations, depending on which of these quantities
exhibited clearly detectable oscillations.
In cases where oscillations are detected in both these
quantities, they have the same frequency. Fluorescence recordings were performed using a high
gain EM-CCD camera from Hamamatsu and a 60X, 1.4 NA objective.

The stock solutions of the chemicals were prepared as follows: 0.2 mg/ml Latrunculin-A, 0.37
mM (-)-blebbistatin, and 50 mM ML-7 were prepared in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO); 100 mM
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM Gadolinium solution using Gadolinium Chloride
Hydrate, and 10 mM Y-27632 were prepared in deionized water; 1 mM Lisophosphatidic acid was
prepared in PBS buﬀer (all chemicals are from Sigma). 1 mM Fluo-4 AM in DMSO (Invitrogen,
Molecular Probes) was used directly for imaging intracellular free calcium. These stock solutions
were added to the culture medium to obtain the desired ﬁnal concentrations. For calcium imaging,
1 µl Fluo-4 was added to adherent cells in a culture ﬂask containing 2 ml IMDM medium and 1%
serum, and left at room temperature for 10 to 20 minutes. The excess dye was then washed oﬀ
and the cells were incubated for an hour before use.

Speciﬁcally coated beads were prepared by rinsing 4.5 µm Dynabeads M-450 Epoxy (Dynal) in
PBS three times and suspending them in a solution of Fibronectin (0.1 %, Sigma, further diluted
by 100 times in PBS) for 1 hour. The suspension was maintained in a vertical rotator to prevent
clumping of the beads and later added to the cells in culture.

RESULTS

Shape oscillations in cells: When the cells are maintained in suspension using hydrophobically
treated glass substrates, about 40% to 60% of them show continuous shape alterations. Most of
these cells exhibit an oscillatory behavior as shown in Fig. 1. The periodic behavior can be much

better perceived from the supplementary movies Movie-1 and Movie-2 (available at [21]). Image
analysis of the shape reveals a highly periodic dynamics as shown in Fig. 2. On hydrophobic
surfaces constant frequency oscillations can then be observed for several hours. When oscillating
cells are left at room temperature overnight and heated to the normal working temperature (35 ◦C)
the next day, the oscillations resume with almost the same frequency as before. This shows that
the oscillatory behavior is a very robust feature of these cells. The period of oscillations, however,
depends on temperature as shown in Fig. 3. It may be noted that all metabolic processes, including
motor protein activity and ﬁlament dynamics, are strongly temperature dependent.

Diﬀerent dynamical behaviors can be observed among active cells, in general depending on the
cell size. (i) Small cells tend to show very periodic behavior. The oscillations in them often show
an elliptic-like mode with the cell tending to oscillate along a preferred direction as shown in Fig.
1 (upper sequence). (ii) Larger cells often show very periodic dynamics but the oscillation modes
are more complex as is the case in Fig. 1 (lower sequence). No clearly deﬁned symmetries could
be observed in them.
Image analysis shows that in some cases the shape change appears as a
propagating cortical wave. (iii) Among larger cells, a few tend to show highly dynamical behavior
but without any well deﬁned periodicity in any of the analyzed quantities (see supplementary
movie Movie-3 [21]). In a population of oscillating cells, the period ranges from about 25 s to 45
s without any clear dependence on cell size. The cell size varies only by about a factor of two
making it diﬃcult to quantify these tendencies in behavior with size. Determination of volume of
the oscillating cells is also diﬃcult due to the fact that the observed shapes, in general, do not
have any symmetry properties that can be exploited to estimate the volume. With this in mind,

no clear indication of any volume change could be observed in small cells with less complex shapes.
Eﬀect of cell-substrate adhesion: Since the oscillations are observed in cells which are
detached from the substrate, we expored the role of adhesion on the oscillatory process and ﬁnd the
following. (i) Cells which are not attached to the hydrophobic substrates (free ﬂoating) and those
which have point-like contacts behave identically as far as the oscillatory dynamics is concerned.
The absence or existence of adhesion is easily veriﬁed by observing the diﬀusive motion of the cells
and/or by applying a small ﬂow disturbance to the culture medium. (ii) When cells are seeded on
clean, untreated glass substrates (a non-speciﬁc substrate), they attach and eventually spread. The
oscillations are observed before the cells attach and after attachment. As cell spreading proceeds
the oscillations become progressively weaker and eventually dies out.
In cases where the cell
subsequently detaches from the surface on its own, the oscillations resume with almost the same
frequency as before. (iii) When an active cell is observed to drift and make contact with another
cell, forming an adhesion patch of about 5 µm, the dynamics continues without any observable
change. (iv) Non-speciﬁc adhesions are diﬀerent from speciﬁc adhesions to adhesion promoting
proteins as far as signaling and cytoskeletal organization are concerned. For this reason we used
4.5 micron epoxy beads coated with Fibronectin and let them attach to the cells. The adhesion
is veriﬁed by pulling on beads stuck to partly spread cells using a home built magnetic tweezer.
When these cells are observed in suspension one to three beads are seen ﬁrmly sticking to most of
the cells. These cells exhibit oscillations with almost the same probability as control cells.

It may be assumed that detachment of the cell-substrate contacts triggers signal transduction
pathways which lead to oscillations. However, the above mentioned experiments clearly show
that having no cell-substrate contact or having small adhesive contacts to speciﬁc or non-speciﬁc
substrates do not aﬀect the observed dynamics. Importantly, whether oscillations are observed
or not does depend on the extent of adhesion suggesting mechanical constraints may impede
oscillations (see point (ii) mentioned above).

For a given cell, the period of oscillation can remain constant for hours. In what follows, we take
advantage of this fact to investigate the response of individual cells to biochemical perturbations
using drugs and other chemical agents.

Eﬀect of actomyosin contractility on oscillations: We observe that depolymerization of
actin ﬁlaments using Latrunculin-A or deactivating myosin using blebbistatin kills the above de-
scribed dynamical behavior.
In order to quantify how the activity of cortical actomyosin gel
inﬂuences the dynamics we exposed the cells to increasing concentration of blebbistatin, a highly

activity of myosin motors and the frequency of oscillations. At drug concentrations of about 5 µM
the oscillations are observed only intermittently. At still higher concentrations the shape dynamics
ceases completely.

In order to perform a complementary experiment to verify the eﬀect of contractility on the period,
we exposed normal cells to increasing amounts of serum. Serum is known to increase contractility
in ﬁbroblasts in a linear fashion with concentration [24], due to increased myosin phosphorylation
[25, 26]. Indeed, we observe a decrease in oscillation period with increasing serum concentration
as shown in Fig. 5.

These experiments show that the frequency of oscillations increases with increasing actomyosin
contractility. Remarkably, there is a clear transition from erratic shape dynamics to periodic

6

oscillations as the contractility is increased as shown in Fig. 5(inset). Erratic oscillations are also
observed at high blebbistatin concentrations (about 5 µM), suggesting a dynamic transition from
erratic to regular oscillations as the myosin activity or contractility of the cell is increased gradually.
Myosin activation pathways: We also performed experiments aimed at understanding the
myosin activation mechanisms involved in the oscillation process. Experiments using drugs to
block the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) or the Rho kinase pathway reveals the following. (i)
When 25 µM Y-27632, a Rho kinase inhibitor [27], is added to oscillating cells, all the observed
cells (> 100) stopped oscillating well within a minute, the time taken for the drug concentration to
homogenize. (ii) Most cells (more than 90%) suspended in medium without any serum do not show
any shape dynamics. When 50 µM lisophosphatidic acid (LPA) is added more than 90% of the cells
become highly dynamic with many showing oscillatory behavior. LPA activates contractility via
the Rho pathway [28, 29]. (iii) When exposed to 25 µM ML-7 to block MLCK [30], in presence of
1% serum, all the oscillating cells (> 100) stopped oscillating in about 5 to 10 minutes. The time
taken appears to depend on the amount of serum. When 25 µM ML-7 was added to cells in medium
without serum and with 50 µM LPA, the action of the drug was dramatically faster. Almost all
cells (> 95%) stopped oscillating within the ﬁrst minute and a few that continued stopped in 5
minutes.

The above experiments clearly show that both the Rho kinase as well as the MLCK pathways
are necessary for the oscillatory dynamics. Further, it shows that oscillations can be triggered in
these cells purely by increasing the Rho kinase activity using LPA.

Eﬀect of extracellular calcium on oscillations: It is known that transient variations in free
calcium ion concentration inside the cell can lead to a modulation of the mechanical properties of
[1]. Such Ca++ transients could be triggered as a result of small inﬂuxes of
the cortical actin gel
extracellular calcium. In our experiments, when the external Ca++ concentration was gradually
depleted from its normal concentration of about 1–2 mM using EDTA there was no substantial
change in frequency as shown in Fig. 6. At an EDTA concentration of 4 mM or above, suﬃcient
to remove all of the extracellular Ca++, the oscillations ceased for all the observed cells. When
Ca++ was subsequently replenished using CaCl2, the oscillations resumed, clearly showing that
the oscillations can be switched oﬀ and on by altering extracellular free Ca++ concentration in a
narrow range.

same cells by addition of CaCl2 to the medium.

In order to explore the mode of action of extracellular Ca++ we exposed oscillating cells to
Gadolinium ions, a potent blocker of mechanically activated Ca++ channels on the plasma mem-
brane [31, 32]. Upon exposure to this agent the oscillations stopped abruptly in all cells, even
in presence of normal concentration of extracellular calcium. This experiment, along with EDTA
experiments, shows that Ca++ inﬂux via mechanosensitive ion channels is vital to the oscillatory
mechanism.

FIG. 7: Images showing the variations in free calcium ion concentration inside a cell exhibiting strong
shape dynamics (the less bright regions inside the cell is the nucleus), and a plot of the average intensity
inside this cell (also see supplementary ﬁles Movie-4 [21]). Note that although the hot stage was maintained
at 35 ◦C, the actual temperature at the cell was a few degrees lower in this case due to the use of a high
numerical aperture, oil immersion objective, and hence the longer period of oscillations (about 100 s).
After switching on the illumination photobleaching was too strong from 0–150 s making analysis diﬃcult
in this time segment (see text for details).

Intracellular calcium variations: When the cells are loaded with Fluo-4 AM dye and ob-
served under a ﬂuorescence microscope continuous variations in the ﬂuorescence intensity can be
observed in dynamic cells. In some cases the variations appears to be roughly periodic. Long term
observation is not possible due to photobleaching of the dye and the resulting toxicity aﬀecting
the dynamics. A typical example is shown in Fig. 7. Note that the longer period of oscillation
(about 100 s) in this case is due to the lower temperature at the cell resulting from the use of
an oil immersion objective. Although this suggests an oscillatory variation of free calcium in the
oscillating cells, this result should be treated a preliminary for the following reasons. (i) The cy-
toplasm inside the oscillating cells ﬂows in correlation with the shape changes. This ﬂow carries
with it ﬂuorescently labeled regions (like calcium rich areas or calcium stores inside the cell). This
problem is greatly reduced by reducing the quantity of dye used as well as the dye loading time.
(ii) The cells are very sensitive to the excitation frequency of about 488 nm once they are loaded
with the dye. Under strong illumination the cells stop oscillating or blebbing within a few seconds
(< 5 s). Under weak illumination, cells can be observed for a few minutes. (iii) Even though
Fluo-4 is widely accepted as an eﬃcient indicator of free calcium in cells, a recent study ﬁnds that
the dye, when exposed to the excitation light, can in itself cause calcium transients [33].

Bleb dynamics in relation to oscillations: It is observed that about 50% of the oscillating
cells exhibit moderate blebbing or membrane bulge formation while showing shape oscillations.
About a few percent can exhibit severe blebbing or blebbing without oscillations (see supplementary
movie Movie-5 [21]). Often a cell oscillates for a while without any signs of membrane blebs or
bulge formation and then begins to exhibit small localized bleb formation which correlates with
the oscillations (see supplementary movie Movie-6 [21]). Detailed experiments on cell oscillations
and blebbing demonstrate a remarkable set of similarities between these two processes. (i) They
are both dynamical processes requiring acto-myosin contractility as shown by treatments using
blebbistatin to inhibit myosin or with Latrunculin-A to disrupt actin ﬁlaments. In suspension,
both these shape dynamics can occur continuously for several hours without any signiﬁcant change
In
in their rates.

(ii) Some cells show both periodic oscillations and blebbing simultaneously.

8

FIG. 8: (a) Sequence of images showing blebbing dynamics in a cell which also shows shape oscillations.
In this particular case an untreated glass substrate was employed, and the cell eventually attaches and
spreads on the glass. Initially, blebbing appears to be roughly periodic with maxima at frames indicated
by the arrows. (b) A rough measure of blebbing is obtained by detecting the envelope which includes all
the blebs (outer boundary). The cortical region can also be detected due to the higher intensity of this
region in phase contrast images (inner boundary). (c) Oscillations of the area of the envelope of blebs
(squares) and area of cortex (circles). The centroid of the detected cortex also oscillates. The plots show
that shape oscillations and blebbing can coexist and blebbing can be roughly periodic in some cases.

rare cases, the extent of blebbing appears to be roughly periodic with a periodicity comparable to
that of the oscillations as shown in Fig. 8 (also see supplementary movie Movie-7 [21]). (iii) More
remarkably, a cell can spontaneously get into one of these two modes or even switch from one to
the other as a function of time. (iv) Removal of extracellular calcium using EDTA or exposure
to the Ca++ channel blocker gadoliniun ions immediately stops blebbing as well as oscillations.
Introducing Ca++ after EDTA treatment reinitiates blebbing or oscillations in the same cells. (v)
All the drug and LPA experiments mentioned earlier give the same results for both the blebbing
as well as the oscillatory dynamics.

The oscillatory shape dynamics and the blebbing dynamics are separated by time and length
scales. The typical time scale for bleb growth and disappearance, which is about 10 s, is shorter
compared to 40 s for oscillations at the same temperature. Similarly, blebbing occurs with a typical
separation between blebs of a few microns, about 5–10 times shorter than the cell size. Blebbing
dynamics shows a wide distribution of these time and length scales while the oscillations are periodic
and global. Further, membrane bulge formation, which characterizes blebbing, occurs only in a
subset of oscillating cells. However, despite these diﬀerences, the above listed experiments suggest
that the underlying mechanisms responsible for cell oscillations and cell blebbing dynamics are
essentially the same. More speciﬁcally, both dynamical behaviors arise from the inherent contractile
nature of the actomyosin gel and involve Ca++ signaling via stretch activation of calcium channels.
This point will be further elaborated in the following section.

DISCUSSION

Oscillatory shape dynamics can be induced in a variety of otherwise non-oscillatory cells, usually
when they are exposed to toxins that speciﬁcally depolymerize microtubules. Bornens et al.
[7]
observed that lymphoblasts with disrupted microtubules exhibit an actomyosin constriction ring
which propagates back and forth with a constant velocity of about 0.1 µms−1. Subsequently,

9

Pletjushkina et al.
[8] reported transient periodic cortical oscillations occurring in spreading
ﬁbroblasts when microtubules are disrupted. Treated cells also exhibited strong blebbing. Further,
they demonstrated a correlation between shape oscillations and free Ca++ concentration inside
the cell. Calcium inﬂux could also be imaged in large blebs. More recently, Paluch et al.
[9]
investigated oscillatory dynamics in cell fragments occurring when microtubules are disrupted. It
is shown that the actin cortex in fragments can break as a result of excess tension. This leads to
an oscillatory dynamics which involves the repeated formation of a bare membrane bulge and a
contractile ring which propagates back and forth in correlation with the oscillations.

Unlike the above examples, the oscillatory dynamics reported here do not involve any biochem-
ical treatments. Non-adherent cells are observed to oscillate spontaneously. Since myosin-II and
actin are necessary for this dynamics, it points to an inherent instability of the actin cortex in
these cells when the contractile cortex is unconstrained by cell-substrate adhesion. Moreover, the
oscillations are very periodic and can be sustained for many hours. The experiments show that
myosin phosphorylation via the calcium dependent MLCK pathway as well as the calcium indepen-
dent Rho kinase pathway are involved and necessary. The oscillatory dynamics is also coupled to
extracellular calcium, which enters the cell via stretch activated calcium channels. The oscillation
frequency is independent of the external calcium concentration except when the external calcium
is almost completely depleted. But there is a clear increase(decrease) in frequency when myosin
activity or cell contractility is increased(decreased) gradually. While some cells show moderate to
severe blebbing, these cells can also oscillate without any observable bleb formation or membrane
bulge formation. This suggests that in such cells the cortex and the membrane-cortex adhesion
remain mostly intact during oscillations.

Based on these observations, we propose a possible mechanisms for oscillations of the actomyosin
cortex which involve a coupling to stretch activated calcium channels on the outer membrane. Due
to the presence of myosin motors, the cortical gel is contractile and generates lateral tension.
In a general case, this tension is anisotropic either due to a non-uniform distribution of myosin
or due to anisotropies in the gel structure. This leads to an anisotropic shape change of the
cortex. If the shape change is signiﬁcant, it can lead to a stretching of the membrane due to a
change in the hydrostatic pressure inside the cell. The cytoplasmic streaming which is observed
suggests such gradients in pressure (Movie-8 [21]). The tension thus generated opens tension
sensitive calcium channels causing an inﬂux of calcium ions into the cell. Tension on actin ﬁlaments
may also play a role in activating gadolinium-sensitive calcium channels as has been reported for
ﬁbroblasts [34]. The free calcium ion concentration inside a cell is about 10−4 mM is far lower
than that of its extracellular value of 1–2 mM [1]. The entry of calcium from outside can thus
lead to a signiﬁcant increase in the free calcium ion concentration inside the cell. This calcium
inﬂux may also trigger a calcium-induced calcium release from internal calcium reserves. Such
a process has been observed in ﬁbtroblasts and other non-muscle cells in response to mechanical
stretch [34, 35], although this may depend on cell type
[36, 37]. Subsequently, the calcium
concentration is brought back to the rest value by absorption of free calcium and by the action
of calcium pumps
[1]. The initial rapid elevation of free calcium has mainly two eﬀects on
the cortical actomyosin gel. Large increases in free calcium concentration can lead to a partial
solation or weakening of the gel due to gelsolin mediated severing of actin ﬁlaments and can
alter the actin polymerization rates [1, 2, 38, 39]. Calcium also aﬀects actin crosslinkers like α-
actinin and other actin binding proteins leading to a weakening of the gel at higher concentrations
(∼ 10−3 mM, ref.
[40], and references therein). The extent of solation depends on the calcium
concentration. In-vitro studies show that a low degree of solation can increase the contraction rates
and strong solation can make the gel non-contractile [38]. At low concentrations, calcium also
causes myosin phosphorylation via the calmodulin-MLCK pathway, by which myosin is assembled
into contractile ﬁlaments [1, 2, 35, 41, 42]. This enhances the contractility of the cortex. These
two processes–the weakening of the gel and increased contractility–may be separated in time. At
high calcium levels the gel is partially solated and as the calcium is reabsorbed into the stores, actin
polymerizes, myosin ﬁlaments bind and the cortex become contractile again. The whole cycle is
then repeated. This scenario, where repeated contractions occur with calcium playing a feedback
role is schematically represented in Fig. 9.

FIG. 9: A schematic of the dynamics explained in the text. Calcium increase is indicated by tiny white
circles and phosphorelated myosin by black patches. The actin cortex contracts anisotropically (1); the
membrane and cortex at the opposite end is stretched and causes calcium inﬂux through stretch activated
channels (2); if the Ca++ level raises high enough, the gel may partially solate due to the excess calcium
(3); as calcium is reabsorbed into internal stores, actin polymerizes, myosin phosphorelates and binds, and
the gel contracts (4); the cycle repeats

It is not clear from the present experiments as to what extent the actin gel structure is altered
by the increase in calcium levels. If severe calcium mediated disruption of the cortex occurs, it will
have the eﬀect of increasing the time delay between calcium inﬂux and the initiation of contractile
response, as the cortex has to reform before contraction can take eﬀect. The role of calcium in
eﬀecting myosin phosphorylation is more clear as shown by experiments using drugs that block the
MLCK pathway. However, experiments show that the frequency of oscillations do not depend on
the extracellular calcium levels even when external calcium levels are reduced using EDTA. This
may be understood if a small inﬂux of extracellular calcium is enough to trigger a much larger
calcium-induced calcium release from internal stores.

It is observed that cells which have stopped oscillating after external calcium is completely
chelated using EDTA can restart oscillations if calcium is reintroduced in the form of CaCl2.
How this calcium enters the cell and triggers oscillations in a non-oscillating cell is not clear.
However, it may be noted that calcium channels on the membrane can open stochastically and
generate “calcium puﬀs” [43]. Such stochastic Ca++ puﬀs may aid in “kick starting” oscillations
by inducing contraction when Ca++ is added from outside.

Experiments clearly demonstrates that the frequency of oscillation increases with increasing
myosin activity. The maximum observed variation is about 30% in the blebbistatin experiment.
This may be understood as a direct eﬀect of the rate of contraction of the gel, which is expected
to increase with increasing number of active myosin motors as observed in in-vitro gels [38]. The
fact that the oscillation ceases at a ﬁnite frequency in the blebbistatin and serum experiments
indicates the existence of a threshold in myosin activity below which an oscillatory instability
cannot occur. Moreover, the observation that myosin phosphorylation via both Rho kinase as well
as the MLCK pathways are necessary further suggests that a high level of phosphorelated myosin
is necessary for this dynamics. Indeed, crosslinked in-vitro gels too exhibit such a threshold as a
function of myosin-II concentration [38]. In earlier examples of oscillations induced by microtubule
depolymerization in spreading ﬁbroblasts, the Rho kinase activation was proposed as the triggering
mechanism for oscillations [8]. This enhanced contractility may have been necessary as these cells
are attached and spread on a substrate and hence the cell cortex is partly constrained and under
tension. In our case, we observe that the oscillations become progressively weaker in amplitude

11

and die out completely as cell spreading proceeds, supporting this hypothesis. Thus, detachment
of cells from the substrate may have the eﬀect of lowering this contractility threshold.

In Paluch et al.

[9], observations made on cell fragments clearly show breakage of the actin cortex
indicating large tension. The cortical breakage is accompanied by a membrane bulge formation.
This may be because the bare membrane is unable to sustain the excess hydrostatic pressure
generated due to contraction. In the present case, cells showing periodic oscillations often show no
membrane bulge formation or blebbing. This is a strong indication that the actin cortex as well
as the membrane-cortex adhesion are intact during oscillations. Indeed, in some cases, a cell can
oscillate without any membrane bulge formation for tens of minutes (observation time) and then
suddenly developed repeated bulge formation in correlation with oscillations. An example is shown
in Movie 5. In such cases either the cortex has become locally weak and tend to break during
contraction or the membrane-cytoskeletal linkages become locally weak resulting in membrane
detachment and bleb formation.

Unlike shape oscillations, blebbing dynamics has been investigated in detail (see, for example, C.
Cunningham [44]) and mechanisms have been proposed recently [45, 46]. It is shown that repeated
local contractions of the actomyosin complex occurs during bleb formation. According to Charras
et al.
[45], the contractions generate a pressure which is diﬀusive due to the resistance to ﬂow
between the cytoplasm and the cortical gel. This produces local maxima in pressure which causes
the membrane to detach and form blebs, at a constant cell volume. As mentioned earlier, in rare
cases (a few percent), cells can be observed to switch between seemingly random blebbing dynamics
to regular oscillatory dynamics as a function of time in the range of tens of minutes. Moreover,
experiments show that actomyosin contractility and similar calcium signaling are involved in both
these dynamical processes.

Why do some cells show periodic and global shape oscillations (Movie-1) while some others
show more complex contractile behavior (Movie-3) and some show blebbing (Movie-5)? A possible
answer to this question may lie in the viscoelastic and contractile nature of the actomyosin gel.
Stresses generated locally in such a gel will typically relax over a certain length and time scale
which depends on the extent of crosslinking and hence the elasticity of the gel. If the gel is highly
crosslinked (more elastic), for example, stresses may propagate distances comparable to the cell
size. Therefore, any contractile stresses are felt all over the cell. This could lead to correlated shape
alterations as is observed in periodically oscillating cells. If on the other hand, the gel is elastically
weak (more viscous than elastic) the stresses die out very quickly, over distances considerably
smaller than the cell size. Volume elements of the gel which are separated by distances which are
bigger than this length scale will not feel each other’s mechanical state. Thus the cell could sustain
several local contractions or relaxations which are largely uncorrelated. Such a transformation
from global contraction to local small-scale contractions is observed in in-vitro gels as the extent
of crosslinking is reduced [38]. Local contractions could then lead to blebbing due to local build
up of pressure and generate local membrane tension [45]. The viscoelastic properties of the gel
may vary from cell to cell or during a cell cycle giving rise to a range of dynamics in a given cell
population. The gel properties may also be modulated over time either due to eﬀects of calcium
or due to other complex biochemical events and the cell can switch from one mode of dynamics to
another. The timescale for bleb formation and retraction will, in general, depend on the bleb size
and the time taken for a fresh cortex to form below the bare membrane and induce contraction
[45].
In fact, this is akin to the shape dynamics in cell fragments where cortical breakage and
membrane bulge formation occurs [9]. In periodically oscillating cells no such membrane bulge
formation is evident and this may explain why the oscillations become remarkably regular.

Finally, it is interesting to note that periodic dynamics and propagating waves are observed in
the lamellipodea of a wide variety of spreading or locomoting cells [12, 13, 47, 48], and in cells
recovering from actin depolymerization [49]. The wave-like cortex dynamics observed in some of
the oscillating cells (see supplementary movie Movie-2) is reminiscent of the lamellipodial waves
observed in some of these cases [13, 48].

Conclusion: We show that ﬁbroblasts can exhibit sustained, remarkably periodic, shape os-
cillations when maintained in suspension, without any treatment with drugs. Even cells removed
from the culture by gentle shaking show sustained oscillatory behavior. These cells are, in general,

12

close to the mitotic state and hence loosely adherent. Thus, the observed dynamics is fundamental
to ﬁbroblast mechanics and may well be relevant under physiological conditions. The implications
of this phenomenon to cytokinesis [50], cell locomotion [11, 51], or during embryogenesis when the
cells are loosely adherent will be of interest for future research. The robustness of the oscillations
and the fact that it can be sustained for several hours makes it an exceptional and relatively simple
model system for experiments aimed at understanding the dynamical properties of cortical actin
gel. The results presented here are also expected to motivate future theoretical modeling based on
the mechanics of contractile actomyosin gels.

The problem of neural coding is to understand how sequences of action po-
tentials (spikes) are related to sensory stimuli, motor outputs, or (ultimately)
thoughts and intentions. One clear question is whether the same coding rules
are used by diﬀerent neurons, or by corresponding neurons in diﬀerent individ-
uals. We present a quantitative formulation of this problem using ideas from
information theory, and apply this approach to the analysis of experiments in
the ﬂy visual system. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant individual diﬀerences in the structure
of the code, particularly in the way that temporal patterns of spikes are used to
convey information beyond that available from variations in spike rate. On the
other hand, all the ﬂies in our ensemble exhibit a high coding eﬃciency, so that
every spike carries the same amount of information in all the individuals. Thus
the neural code has a quantiﬁable mixture of individuality and universality.

Introduction

When two people look at the same scene, do they see the same things?
This basic question in the theory of knowledge seems to be beyond the scope
of experimental investigation. An accessible version of this question is whether
diﬀerent observers of the same sense data have the same neural representation
of these data: how much of the neural code is universal, and how much is
individual? To approach this problem we must give a quantitative deﬁnition of
similarity or distance among neural codes.

The problem of comparing neural codes has some analogies to the problem
of comparing among amino acid sequences in proteins.
In the neural code,
sequences of action potentials stand for sensory inputs or motor outputs; in the
genetic code sequences of nucleotides stand for amino acids which in turn encode
the three dimensional structure of proteins. Just as motifs of several amino
acids collectively can encode structural elements in proteins, patterns of several
action potentials across time or across a population of cells can have a special
meaning. For proteins, sequences can be similar because they have a recent
common ancestor; alternatively, sequences can be equivalent functionally even
if they are distinguishable, since convergent evolution has led to very diﬀerent
sequences that encode proteins with similar structures and functions. For the
neural code we show that these notions of distinguishability and functional
equivalence can be quantiﬁed using ideas from information theory [1, 2].
In
particular this approach does not require a metric either on the space of stimuli
or on the space of neural responses; all notions of similarity emerge from the
statistical structure of the neural responses.

We apply these methods to analyze experiments on an identiﬁed motion
sensitive neuron in the ﬂy’s visual system, the cell H1 [3]. Many invertebrate
nervous systems have cells that can be named and numbered [4], and in many
cases the total number of neurons involved in representing a portion of the
sensory world is quite small, so that destruction of individual neurons can have
a substantial impact on behavior (see, for example, Ref. [5]). In these cases the
neural representation of sensory information is especially accessible, precisely
because it is localized to a small set of identiﬁed cells. On the other hand, if
a large fraction of neurons is identiﬁable it might seem that the question of
whether diﬀerent individuals share the same neural representation of the visual
world would have a trivial answer.

Far from trivial, we shall see that the neural code even for identiﬁed neurons
in ﬂies has components which are common among ﬂies and signiﬁcant compo-
nents which are individual to each ﬂy. The existence of identiﬁed neurons thus
does not preclude the expression of individuality in neural representations; we
should expect that all neural circuits, both vertebrate and invertebrate, express
a degree of universality and a degree of individuality. For H1 we quantify these
ideas, and we hope that the methods we introduce will be applicable more gen-
erally. In the interest of making the discussion more accessible we have conﬁned
mathematical arguments to the Methods section; in the main text we make
use of analogies to provide some intuition for what the information theoretic

2

quantities are measuring.

Distinguishing among ﬂies

We place our discussion in the context of the experiments shown in Fig.
1. Nine diﬀerent ﬂies are shown precisely the same movie, which is repeated
many times for each ﬂy; as we show the movie we record the action potentials
from the H1 neuron. The details of the stimulus movie should not have a
qualitative impact on the results, provided that the movie that is suﬃciently
long and rich to drive the system through a reasonable and natural range of
responses. Figure 1b makes clear that qualitative features of the neural response
on long time scales (∼ 100 ms) are common to almost all the ﬂies, and that some
aspects of the response are reproducible on a (few) millisecond time scale across
multiple presentations of the movie to each ﬂy. Nonetheless the responses are
not identical in the diﬀerent ﬂies, nor are they perfectly reproduced from trial
to trial in the same ﬂy. The most obvious diﬀerence among the ﬂies is in the
average spike rate, which varies from 22 to 63 spikes/s among our ensemble
of ﬂies. But beyond that, how should we quantify the similarity or diﬀerence
among the neural responses?

One way is to imagine that each spike train is a point in an abstract space,
and that there is a metric on this space. Considerable eﬀort has gone into
the deﬁnition of metrics that are plausible biologically and tractable computa-
tionally [6, 7], and these methods have been used widely (for applications in
neurobiology (see [7, 8, 9]), but all approaches based on metric spaces have sev-
eral problems. First, the metric is imposed by the investigator and does not
emerge from the data. Second, even within a plausible class of metrics there are
arbitrary parameters, such as the relative distance cost of moving vs. deleting a
spike. Finally, it is not clear that our intuitive notion of similarity among neural
responses (or amino acid sequences) is captured by the mathematical concept
of a metric.

In contrast, information theory [1] provides a method for quantifying di-
rectly the diﬀerences among the sources of the spike trains. Imagine that we
record multiple speakers reading from the same text, in the same way that we
record the activity of neurons from diﬀerent ﬂies responding to the same sensory
inputs. There are many possible speakers, and we are shown a small sample
of the speech signal: how well can we identify the speaker? If we can collect
enough data to characterize the distribution of speech sounds made by each
speaker then we can quantify, in bits, the average amount of information that
a segment of speech gives about the identity of the speaker. Further we can
decompose this information into components carried by diﬀerent features of the
sounds. Following this analogy, we will measure the information that a segment
of the neural response provides about the identity of the ﬂy, and we will ask
how this individuality is distributed across diﬀerent features of the spike train.
Apparently large diﬀerences in spike rate are surprisingly uninformative, but the
temporal patterns of spikes allow for much more eﬃcient discrimination among

3

individuals. The largest diﬀerences among individuals are in the way that these
patterns are associated with speciﬁc stimulus features.

We discretize the neural response into time bins of size ∆t = 2 ms, which
is also the time required to draw one frame of the stimulus movie. At this
resolution there are almost never two spikes in a single bin, so we can think of
the neural response as a binary string, as in Fig. 1c-d. We examine the response
in blocks or windows of time having length T , so that an individual neural
response becomes a binary ‘word’ W with T /∆t ’letters’. Clearly, any ﬁxed
choice of T and ∆t is arbitrary, and so we explore a range of these parameters.
The distribution of words used by a particular ﬂy’s H1 in response to the
stimulus movie, P i(W ) for the ith ﬂy, tells us about the ‘vocabulary’ of that cell.
Figure 1f shows that diﬀerent ﬂies ‘speak’ with similar but distinct vocabularies.
From these distributions P i(W ) we can quantify the average information that a
single word of length T gives about the identity of the ﬂy, I(W → identity; T )
[see Eq. (1) in Methods]. Thus, we measure how well we can discriminate be-
tween one individual and a mixture of all the other individuals in the ensemble,
or eﬀectively how ‘far’ each individual is from the mean of her conspeciﬁcs.

The ﬁnite size of our data set prevents us from exploring arbitrarily long
words, but happily we ﬁnd that information about identity is accumulating at
more or less constant rate R well before the undersampling limits of the exper-
iment are reached (Fig. 2a). Thus I(W → identity; T ) ≈ R(W → identity) · T ;
R(W → identity) ≈ 5 bits/s, with a very weak dependence on the time resolu-
tion ∆t. Since the mean spike rate can be measured by counting the number
of 1s in each word W , this information includes the diﬀerences in ﬁring rate
among the diﬀerent ﬂies.

Even if ﬂies use very similar ‘vocabularies,’ they may diﬀer substantially in
the way that they associate words with particular stimulus features.
In our
experiments the stimulus runs continuously in a loop, so that we can specify
the stimulus precisely by giving the time relative to the start of the loop; in
this way we don’t need to make any assumptions about which features of the
stimulus are important for the neuron, nor do we need a metric in the space of
stimuli. We can therefore consider the word W that the ith ﬂy will generate at
time t. This word is drawn from the distribution P i(W |t) which we can sample,
as in Fig. 1c–e, by looking across multiple presentations of the same stimulus
movie. In parallel with the discussion above, we can now ask for the average
information that a word W provides about identity given that it was observed
at a particular time t. This depends on the time t because some moments in the
stimulus are more informative than others, as is obvious from Fig. 1. The more
natural quantity is an average over all times t, which is the average information
that we can gain about the identity of the ﬂy by observing a word W at a known
time t relative to the stimulus, I({W, t} → identity; T ) [see Eq. (5) in Methods].
Figure 2b shows a plot of I({W, t} → identity; T )/T as a function of the
observation time window of size T . Observing both the spike train and the
stimulus together provides 32 ± 1 bits/s about the identity of the ﬂy. This is
more than six times as much information as we can gain by observing the spike
train alone, and corresponds to gaining one bit in ∼ 30 ms. Correspondingly,

4

a typical pair of ﬂies in our ensemble can be distinguished reliably in ∼ 30 ms.
This is the time scale on which ﬂies actually use their estimates of visual motion
to guide their ﬂight during chasing behavior [10], so that the neural codes of
diﬀerent individuals are distinguishable on the time scales relevant to behavior.

Spike rates and information rates

Having seen that we can distinguish reliably among individual ﬂies using
relatively short samples of the neural response, it is natural to ask about the ori-
gins and implications of these individual diﬀerences. Perhaps the most obvious
question is whether the substantial diﬀerences in the code among the diﬀerent
neurons have an impact on the ability of these cells to convey information about
the visual stimulus. As discussed in Refs. [11, 12], the rate at which the neural
response provides information about the visual stimulus, Ri(W → s(t); T ), is
determined by the same probability distributions P i(W |t) as before [see Eq’s.
(6–9) in Methods]. Again we note that our estimate of the information rate
itself is independent of any metric in the space of stimuli, nor does it depend
on assumptions about which stimulus features are most important in the code.
Figure 3a shows that the ﬂies in our ensemble span a range of informa-
tion rates from Ri(W → s(t)) ≈ 50 to ≈ 150 bits/s. This threefold range of
information rates is correlated with the range of spike rates, so that each of
the cells transmits nearly a constant amount of information per spike, 2.39 ±
0.24 bits/spike. The error bar in this case (±0.24 bits/spike) is a standard devi-
ation across the ensemble of ﬂies, not a standard error of the mean: the number
of bits per spike transmitted by H1 (under these stimulus conditions) is constant
from ﬂy to ﬂy within 10%, despite three fold variations in total spike rate.

Although information rates are correlated with spike rates, this does not
mean that information is carried by a “rate code” alone. Rate coding usually
is distinguished from “timing codes” in which the detailed temporal structure
of the spike train plays a crucial role. In particular, our computation of the
information carried by the spike train includes automatically any contribution
from temporal patterns, but to demonstrate that these patterns are important
we must show that this information is more than we expect just by summing
the contributions of the individual spikes that make up the patterns. This
‘single spike information’ can also be thought of as the information conveyed by
temporal modulations in the spike rate; see Ref. [14] and Eq. (11) in Methods.
For all the ﬂies in our ensemble, the total rate at which the spike train carries
information is substantially larger than the ‘single spike’ information—2.39 vs.
1.64 bits/spike, on average. This extra information, as deﬁned in Eq. (12) and
illustrated in Fig. 3b, is carried in the temporal patterns of spikes.

The fact that the information per spike is constant across the ensemble of
ﬂies means that cells with higher spike rates are not generating extra spikes
at random, but rather each extra spike is equally informative about the visual
stimulus. The capacity of the code to carry information is quantiﬁed by the
entropy rate S i
total of the distribution of neural responses [see Eq’s. (6,10) in
Methods], and is diﬀerent in diﬀerent ﬂies. It is natural [13, 15] to deﬁne the

5

eﬃciency of the code as the fraction of this capacity which is used to convey
information about the visual stimulus, ǫi = Ri(W → s(t))/S i
total. Like the
information per spike, this eﬃciency is nearly constant across the ensemble of
ﬂies, ǫ = 0.59 ± 0.05, at ∆t = 2 ms, with a very weak dependence on ∆t [12].

A universal codebook?

Even though ﬂies diﬀer in the structures of their neural responses, distin-
guishable responses could be functionally equivalent, as with distinct amino acid
sequences that fold to the same protein structure. It might therefore be that all
ﬂies could be endowed (genetically?) with a universal or consensus codebook
that allows each individual to make sense of her own spike trains, despite the
diﬀerences from her conspeciﬁcs. Thus we want to ask how much information
we lose if the identity of the ﬂies is hidden from us, or equivalently how much
each ﬂy can gain by knowing its own individual code.

The codebook for any individual ﬂy can be thought of as a probabilistic
mapping from neural responses or words back into the space of visual stimuli
[16]. The information conveyed by the spike train quantiﬁes the speciﬁcity of
this mapping: the ‘tighter’ the distribution of stimuli consistent with a given
response the more information is conveyed. If the neural codes used by diﬀerent
ﬂies are diﬀerent, then these conditional distributions in stimulus space are
also diﬀerent.
If we don’t know the identity of the ﬂy, all we can do is to
associate each neural response with a distribution of stimuli that corresponds
to an average over the individuals, and this distribution necessarily is broader
than any of the individual distributions. As a result, we have less information
about the visual stimulus, as summarized by Eq. (14) in the Methods.

Intuitively, the greater the diﬀerences among the neural responses of diﬀerent
ﬂies, the more visual information we will lose if we don’t know the identity of the
individual. On the other hand, these diﬀerences mean that the neural response
provides information about individual identity, so that information gained about
identity is information lost about the stimulus if we use a universal codebook.
This intuitive connection is made precise by Eq. (15) in the Methods. As a
practical matter, this means that the answer to our question about the eﬃcacy
of a universal decoder is contained in the results of Fig. 2. The result is that,
on average, not knowing the identity of the ﬂy limits us to extracting only 64
bits/s of information about the visual stimulus. This should be compared with
the average information rate of 92.3 bits/s in our ensemble of ﬂies: knowing her
own identity allows the average ﬂy to extract 44% more information from H1.
Further analysis shows that each individual ﬂy gains approximately the same
relative amount of information from knowing its personal codebook.

6

The nature of the ‘personal’ bits

Thus far we have analyzed the diﬀerences among the neural codes of dif-
ferent ﬂies, and how much extra information a ﬂy can extract by knowing it’s
individual codebook. It is natural to ask what is being “said” by these extra
bits, characterizing more explicitly the mapping from neural responses back to
stimulus space for the diﬀerent ﬂies.

For each neural response W we can look back through the entire experiment
and accumulate the motion trajectories that lead up to the response, and these
provide samples from the distribution of stimuli conditional on the response as
described above. Because the space of trajectories has many dimensions, this
distribution is diﬃcult to visualize, and so we focus here on the means of these
distributions. This is a generalization of the reverse correlation or spike triggered
average method [13]: rather than looking at the average stimulus that leads to
a single spike, we look at the average stimulus that leads to the responses W ,
which can consist of a pattern of spikes and empty intervals [16].

In Fig. 4 we show the average waveforms of the stimulus velocity preced-
ing a speciﬁc binary word in the spike trains of ﬂies 1 and 6. As ﬂy 6 spike
trains convey almost 3 times more information about the stimulus, one might
have speculated that the same word was used in completely diﬀerent stimulus
contexts for the two ﬂies. In fact, the diﬀerences are in the details and not in
the general picture: spikes stand for pulses of positive velocity (as in Fig. 4b),
long silent intervals stand for negative velocities (as in Figs. 4a&c), and the
largest diﬀerences among the ﬂies are in the widths, latencies and amplitudes
of the pulses; combinations of spikes and intervals then lead to very diﬀerent
trajectories (as in Fig. 4d). For the ﬂy which conveys less information, spikes
are associated with larger positive velocities (Fig. 4b) and silences are associ-
ated with (slightly) larger negative velocities (Fig. 4a); thus, these elementary
responses come closer to exhausting the dynamic range of the inputs. Con-
versely, the more informative spike train covers the dynamic range of inputs
with a greater variety of composite responses.

Discussion

One obvious diﬀerence between invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems
is the existence of identiﬁed neurons in invertebrates. The identiﬁability of in-
vertebrate neurons sometimes has been interpreted to mean that these smaller
nervous systems are hard wired automata; indeed the optomotor system of ﬂies
has been held up as a clear example of this extreme view. In this view, indi-
viduality plays no role, and it should even be possible to average the results
of experiments on corresponding neurons in diﬀerent individuals. For verte-
brates, substantial individuality arises through development and learning, and
there are few if any identiﬁed neurons; at best vertebrates have identiﬁable
modules consisting of hundreds or thousands of neurons, such as the columns
in visual cortex. Against this clear dichotomy it is worth remembering that

7

even genetically identical single celled organisms exhibit individuality in their
sensory–motor behavior [17].

In the present work we have tried to the quantify the individuality of the
neural code used by a single neuron in the ﬂy visual system. On the one hand,
this individuality is suﬃcient to allow discrimination among individuals on time
scales of relevance to behavior. Correspondingly, each individual ﬂy would lose
a signiﬁcant amount (∼ 30%) of the visual information carried by this neuron
if it ‘knew’ only the codebook appropriate to the whole ensemble of ﬂies. On
the other hand, these diﬀerences among the codebooks of diﬀerent ﬂies seem
to be matters of detail. Although diﬀerent ﬂies extract very diﬀerent amounts
of information from the same visual inputs, all the ﬂies achieve a high and
constant eﬃciency in their encoding of this information. From previous work it
is known that the visual system of an individual ﬂy exhibits substantial changes
in coding strategy as it adapts to diﬀerent ensembles of inputs. Rather than
converging on the same information rates in diﬀerent ﬂies, these adaptation
processes seem to converge on codes of uniformly high eﬃciency, supporting the
idea that eﬃciency of representation is a ‘design principle’ for the system [18].
On average the ﬂies in our ensemble have neural codes in which a substantial
amount of information is carried by patterns of spikes. This antiredundancy
or synergy among spikes [14] is reduced substantially if we are forced to use
a universal codebook. Mathematically this loss of synergy in the universal
codebook is related to the fact that the rate at which we gain information about
the identity of the ﬂy (Fig. 2b) increases with window size out to Tc ∼ 10 ms:
discrimination among ﬂies is enhanced by being able to see patterns of spikes
in windows of size Tc, implying that the way these patterns are used to encode
visual information is unique to each individual. Each individual ﬂy thus gains
nearly 50% more information through the use of a code in which patterns of
spikes carry extra information, and more than half of this is lost if the ﬂy does
not have knowledge of its own identity. Not only is spike timing important
for the neural code, but the way in which timing is used is speciﬁc to each
individual.

Methods

Flies, neural recording and stimulus generation
Recordings were made from the H1 neuron using standard methods: the ﬂy was
immobilized in wax, a tungsten microelectrode was inserted through a small
hole at the back of the ﬂy’s head, and H1 was identiﬁed through its response
properties; spikes were detected with a window discriminator. The stimulus was
a rigidly moving pattern of vertical bars, randomly dark or bright, with average
intensity ¯I ≈ 100mW/(m2 · sr), displayed on a Tektronix 608 high brightness
display; bar widths were set equal to the horizontal lattice spacing (interomma-
tidial angle) of the compound eye. The ﬂy viewed the display through a round

8

diaphragm, showing approximately 30 bars. Frames of the stimulus pattern
were refreshed every 2 ms, and with each new frame the pattern was displayed
at a new position. This resulted in an apparent horizontal motion of the bar
pattern, which is suitable to excite the H1 neuron. The pattern position was
deﬁned by a pseudorandom sequence, simulating a diﬀusive motion or random
walk. We draw attention to three points relevant for the present analysis: (1)
The ﬂies are freshly caught female Calliphora, so that our ‘ensemble of ﬂies’ ap-
proaches a natural ensemble and is not restricted to a highly inbred laboratory
stock. (2) In each ﬂy we identify the H1 cell as the unique spiking neuron in the
lobula plate that has a combination of wide ﬁeld sensitivity, inward directional
selectivity for horizontal motion, and contralateral projection. (3) Recordings
are rejected only if raw electrode signals are excessively noisy or unstable; in
particular we do not select for ﬂies that exhibit mean spike rates (spontaneous
or driven) in a predeﬁned range.

Deﬁnition of I(W → identity; T )
Imagine that we record the response of the H1 neuron from one ﬂy, but we
don’t know which one. A priori there are N equally likely possibilities. Once we
observe the spike train for some time T our uncertainty is reduced, and hence we
gain information about the identity of the ﬂy from which we are recording. The
average information that an individual word provides about the ﬂy’s identity is

I(W → identity; T ) =

N

Xi=1

PiXW

P i(W ) log2(cid:20) PiP i(W )

P ens(W )(cid:21) bits,

(1)

where Pi = 1/N is the a priori probability that we are recording from ﬂy i and
P ens(W ) is the probability that any ﬂy in the whole ensemble of ﬂies would
generate the word W ,

P ens(W ) =

PiP i(W ).

N

Xi=1

(2)

The measure I(W → identity; T ) has been discussed by Lin [19] as the ‘Jensen–
Shannon divergence’ DJS among the distributions P i(W ). We recall that the
problem of ﬁnding a measure of similarity among distributions is not simple;
obvious choices such as the Kullback–Leibler divergence are not symmetric,
and may have spurious technical requirements such as absolute continuity of
one distribution with respect to the others. Lin proposed DJS as a way of
getting around these diﬃculties, and he showed that DJS can be used to bound
other measures of similarity, such as the optimal or Bayesian probability of
identifying correctly the origin of a sample (as in forced choice psychophysical
discrimination experiments). Here DJS arises not just as an interesting possible
measure of similarity (see also [20]), but as the unique answer to the question
of how much information a sample provides about its source.

9

Deﬁnition of I({W, t} → identity; T )
By analogy with Eq. (2) we deﬁne the distribution of words used at time t by
the whole ensemble of ﬂies.

P ens(W |t) =

PiP i(W |t),

N

Xi=1

(3)

and by analogy with Eq. (1) we can measure the information that the word W
observed at known t gives us about the identity of the ﬂy,

I(W → identity|t; T ) =

N

Xi=1

PiXW

P i(W |t) log2(cid:20) PiP i(W |t)
P ens(W |t)(cid:21) .

The more natural quantity is an average over all times t,

I({W, s(t)} → identity; T ) = hI(W → identity|t; T )it bits,

(5)

where h· · ·it denotes an average over t.

Deﬁnition of I i(W → s(t); T )

words,

[11, 12]. The entropy of the distribution of

Si

total(T ) = −XW

P i(W ) log2 P i(W ) bits,

(6)

measures the capacity of the neuron to transmit information. At each time t we
can deﬁne the entropy of the conditional distribution P i(W |t), which measures
the noise in the response to repeated presentations of the same movie,

Si

noise(t; T ) = −XW

P i(W |t) log2 P i(W |t) bits.

(7)

The information is the diﬀerence between the total entropy of the cell’s vocab-
ulary and the average noise entropy,

I i(W → s(t); T ) = Si

total(T ) − hSi

noise(t; T )it.

(8)

For suﬃciently large window of time T , we expect that to gain information in
proportion to the duration of our observations,

I i(W → s(t); T ) ≈ Ri(W → s(t)) · T,

(9)

so that there is a well deﬁned information rate Ri(W → s(t)). This asymptotic
behavior is observed in the data for values of T that are relevant to ﬂy behavior.
Similar behavior is observed for the total entropy,

Si
total(T ) ≈ S i

total · T,

(10)

leading to the deﬁnition of coding eﬃciency discussed in the text [13, 15].

[14].

Information from single spikes
The discussion here follows Ref.
In the experiments the stimulus runs
continuously for a time Tloop and then repeats. When we observe a single spike
at time t we learn something about the stimulus in the neighborhood of this
time, and if we average this information over all possible arrival times we obtain
the average information carried by a single spike. Because information is mutual,
we can relate the information that the spike provides about the stimulus to the
information that the stimulus provides about the occurrence of a spike, but this
is contained in the time dependent ﬁring rate or post–stimulus time histogram
for cell i, ri(t). After some algebra [14], the single spike information takes the
form of an integral that depends only on ri(t),

I i
one spike =

1

Tloop Z Tloop

0

dt

ri(t)

¯ri

log2(cid:20) ri(t)

¯ri (cid:21) bits,

(11)

where ¯ri is the average spike rate in cell i. If spikes were to carry information
independently, then each cell would transmit Ri
one spike bits per second.
If the total information rate Ri(W → s(t)) is smaller than this then spikes are
redundant (on average) while if the total information rate is larger then there
is synergy [14] among the spikes and the extra information must be carried in
the temporal patterns of spikes. We can quantify this extra information as a
fraction,

ind = ¯riI i

F i
extra = [Ri(W → s(t)) − Ri

ind]/Ri

ind,

(12)

as illustrated in Fig. 3b.

Information loss with universal decoding
If we observe the response of a neuron but don’t know the identity of the indi-
vidual generating this response, then we are observing responses drawn from the
ensemble distributions deﬁned above, P ens(W |t) and P ens(W ). The information
that words provide about the visual stimulus then is

I mix(W → s(t); T ) =*XW

P ens(W |t) log2(cid:20) P ens(W |t)

P ens(W ) (cid:21)+t

bits.

(13)

On the other hand, if we know the identity of the ﬂy to be i, we gain the
information I i(W → s(t); T ) from above [Eq’s. (6–8)]. The average information
loss is then

I avg
loss(W → s(t); T ) =

N

Xi=1

PiI i(W → s(t); T ) − I mix(W → s(t); T ).

(14)

After some algebra it can be shown that this average information loss is related
to the information that the neural responses give about the identity of the
individuals, as deﬁned above:

11

I avg
loss(W → s(t); T ) = I({W, t} → identity; T )

−I(W → identity; T ).

Figure 1. Diﬀerent ﬂies’ spike trains and word statistics. (a) All ﬂies view the
same random vertical bar pattern moving across their visual ﬁeld with a time
dependent velocity, part of which is shown (see Methods section for details).
In the experiment, a 40 sec waveform is presented repeatedly, 90 times. (b) A
set of 45 response traces to the part of the stimulus shown in (a) from each of
the 9 ﬂies. The traces are taken from the segment of the experiment where the
transient responses have decayed. Spike trains from ﬂies 1 and 6 are colored
by red and blue, respectively, which we will use as a color code for the other
parts of the ﬁgure.(c) Example of construction of the local word distributions.
Zooming in on a segment of the repeated responses of ﬂy 1 to the visual stimuli
(see green rectangle in (b)), the ﬂy’s spike trains are divided into contiguous
2 ms bins, and the spikes in each of the bins are counted. E.g., we get the
6 letter words that the ﬂy used at time 3306 ms into the input trace. (d)
Similar as (c) for ﬂy 6. (e) The distributions of words that ﬂies 1 and 6 used
at time t = 3306 ms from the beginning of the stimulus. The time dependent
distributions, P 1(W |t = 3306 ms) and P 6(W |t = 3306 ms) are presented as a
function of the binary value of the actual ’word’, e.g., binary word value ′17′
stands for the word ′010001′. (f ) Collecting the words that each of the ﬂies
used through all of the visual stimulus presentations, we get the total word
distributions for ﬂies 1 and 6, P 1(W ) and P 6(W ).

Figure 2. Distinguishing one ﬂy from others based on spike trains. (a) The
average rate of information gained about the identity of a ﬂy, given the distribu-
tion of words that it used throughout the stimulus presentations, as a function
of the word size used. The information rate is saturated even before we reach
the maximal word length used; for more discussion of word lengths see Meth-
ods. Following Figure 1, Red marks are the average rate of information that the
word distribution of ﬂy 1 give about its identity, compared with the word dis-
tribution mixture of all of the ﬂies. The connecting line is used for clariﬁcation
only. Blue marks the results for ﬂy 6, and the black marks the average over all
9 ﬂies. See methods for discussion of error bars calculation. (b) Similar to the
computation done for (a), we can compute the average amount of information
that is gained about the identity of the ﬂy, give its word distribution at a spe-
ciﬁc time, compared with the mixture of the word distribution of all of the 9
ﬂies. Averaging over all times, we get the average amount of information gained
about the identity of ﬂy 1 based on its time dependent word distributions (red),
ﬂy 6 (blue), and the average over the 9 ﬂies (black).

Figure 3. The information about the stimulus that a ﬂy’s spike train carries is
correlated with ﬁring rate, and yet a signiﬁcant part is in the temporal structure.
(a) The rate at the H1 spike train provides information about the visual stimulus
is shown as a function of the average spike rate, with each ﬂy providing a single
data point (Fly 1 is marked by a red point and Fly 6 by a blue one). The
linear ﬁt of the data points for the 9 ﬂies corresponds to a universal rate of
2.39±0.24 bits/spike, as noted in the text. (b) The extra amount of information
that the temporal structure of the spike train of each of the ﬂies carry about

15

the stimulus, as a function of the average ﬁring rate of the ﬂy [see Eq. (12) in
Methods]. The average amount of additional information that is carried by the
temporal structure of the spike trains, over the population is 45 ± 17%.

Figure 4. What diﬀerent ﬂies mean by the same words. The word-triggered
averages are shown for ﬂies 1 (red) and 6 (blue) for 4 diﬀerent words. Similar to
the computation of spike triggered averages, we compute the average velocity
proﬁle of the movie presented to the ﬂies, preceding 7-letter binary words. (a)
The average stimulus waveform preceding the word ′0000000′ for Flies 1 (red)
and 6 (blue), is shown as a function of the time relative to the end of the word
(shown in actual time order on the right top side of the panel). (b-d) Word
triggered averages for 3 other words, reﬂecting that the waveforms haves similar
rough structure, and that the diﬀerence between the ﬂies is in the details.

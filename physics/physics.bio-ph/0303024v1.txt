A sound stimulus entering the inner ear excites a deformation of the basilar membrane which
travels along the cochlea towards the apex. It is well established that this wave-like disturbance is
ampliﬁed by an active system. Recently, it has been proposed that the active system consists of a
set of self-tuned critical oscillators which automatically operate at an oscillatory instability. Here,
we show how the concepts of a traveling wave and of self-tuned critical oscillators can be combined
to describe the nonlinear wave in the cochlea.

PACS numbers: 87.10.+e, 47.35.+i, 05.45.-a

The sounds that we hear are detected within the cochlea
of the inner ear, a ﬂuid-ﬁlled duct which is coiled like the
chamber of a snail’s shell. This compartment is parti-
tioned along almost its entire length by the basilar mem-
brane (BM). Incoming sound waves set the BM into mo-
tion and its minute vibrations are monitored by special-
ized sensory hair cells [1]. The pioneering experiments
of von B´ek´esy [2], which were conducted on cadavers,
demonstrated that sound excites a traveling wave on the
BM, whose amplitude reaches a peak at a place which de-
pends on the frequency. This suggested that the cochlea
acts as a spatial frequency analyzer. When it became fea-
sible to measure the BM response of living specimens, a
marked diﬀerence from von B´ek´esy’s results was revealed.
The sharpness of ﬁltering was greatly enhanced and the
response displayed pronounced nonlinear behavior close
to resonance [3, 4, 5, 6]. These observations, together
with the discovery that ears spontaneously emit sounds
at speciﬁc frequencies [7], provided direct evidence for an
active nonlinear ampliﬁer in the cochlea [1], as had been
foreseen by Gold [8]. But just how the ear could reliably
employ an active process without suﬀering from unstable
behavior has long been a matter of concern.

An active ampliﬁer which overcomes this diﬃculty has
recently been outlined [9, 10, 11]. It has been proposed
that the cochlea contains a set of dynamical systems,
each of which is maintained at the threshold of an os-
cillatory instability by a self-tuning mechanism. Poised
at this critical point, on the verge of vibrating, each sys-
tem is especially responsive to periodic stimuli at its own
characteristic frequency. The concept of self-tuned crit-
ical oscillators [10] can account for the main features of
hearing: sharp frequency selectivity, extreme sensitivity
and wide dynamic range; and also for interference eﬀects
such as two-tone suppression and the generation of com-
bination tones [12]. In this letter, we marry the concept
of critical oscillators with the physics of the traveling
wave to provide a unifying description of active cochlear
mechanics.

Cochlear waves.—The basic physics of cochlear waves

may be described most succinctly by a one-dimensional
model [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The BM separates the cochlear
duct into two channels which are connected at the apex
by a small aperture, the helicotrema. A sound stimulus
impinging on the oval window, at the base of the cochlea,
causes changes in the pressures P1(x, t) and P2(x, t) in
both channels. Here t is the time and x is the position
along the cochlea, with the oval window at x = 0 and
the helicotrema at x = L. The pressure gradients induce
longitudinal currents J1(x, t) and J2(x, t), which ﬂow in
opposite directions in the two channels. We deﬁne the
relative current j ≡ J1 − J2 and the pressure diﬀerence
p ≡ P1 − P2. Then the balance of pressure gradients and
inertial forces in the ﬂuid may be written

ρ∂tj = −bl∂xp ,

(1)

where ρ is the ﬂuid mass density, l is the height of each
channel, and b is the breadth of the BM. The conservation
of ﬂuid volume implies that a variation in the current
along the cochlea must be accommodated by a movement
of the cochlear partition. We describe such deformations
of the BM by its height h(x, t) as a function of time and
position. Then the conservation law is

2b∂th + ∂xj = 0 .

Combining this with Eq. (1), we obtain an equation for
the BM acceleration

2ρb∂2

t h = ∂x [bl∂xp]

.

The pressure diﬀerence p acts to deform the BM. If the
response is passive (eg. in the dead cochlea), the response
relation close to the basal end, where the stiﬀness K(x)
of the BM is high, takes the simple form

p(x, t) = K(x)h(x, t)

,

(4)

for small disturbances. Eqs.
(3) & (4) together yield
a linear wave equation for the pressure, with local wave
propagation velocity

Critical oscillators.—In the active cochlea, the passive
response is ampliﬁed by a force-generating system. This
system comprises a set of mechanical oscillators which
are supported on the BM, and which are positioned in
such a way that they can drive its motion. The char-
acteristic frequency ωr(x) of the oscillators is a function
of position along the membrane. In general, such oscil-
lators could either vibrate spontaneously and thus gen-
erate motion in the absence of a stimulus, or they could
be quiescent and behave like a passive system. A par-
ticularly interesting case arises at the boundary of these
two regimes, when every oscillator operates exactly at
the critical point where it undergoes an oscillatory in-
stability. Automatic regulation to this critical point —
or Hopf bifurcation — can in general be achieved by us-
ing a robust self-tuning mechanism based on local feed-
back control [10].
If the BM contains such self-tuned
critical oscillators, its deformation h in response to pres-
sure diﬀerences across the membrane p has characteristic
properties as a function of frequency and amplitude, and
nonlinear ampliﬁcation occurs.

In order to describe this system, we ﬁrst consider an
individual oscillator. Its characteristic response to peri-
odic forcing at frequency ω can be written in a general
form as [10]

˜p = A(ω)˜h + B|˜h|2˜h .
(6)
Here, ˜h and ˜p are the Fourier amplitudes at the forcing
frequency and A and B are complex coeﬃcients. This
expression follows from a systematic expansion in the os-
cillation amplitude ˜h which is valid close to the Hopf bi-
furcation (comparable to a Landau expansion of the free
energy of thermodynamic systems near a critical point).
Proximity to an oscillatory instability thus automatically
provides for generic nonlinearities. The dominant nonlin-
earity is cubic, a result that follows from time-translation
invariance. The linear response coeﬃcient A vanishes at
the characteristic frequency ωr of the oscillator so that,
at this particular frequency, the response becomes purely
nonlinear for small amplitudes.

Thus if we focus on a particular location x of the BM,
its response displays a nonlinear resonance when the fre-
quency of the stimulus is equal to the local characteris-
tic frequency ωr(x) of the oscillators. The shape of the
resonance, for nearby frequencies, can be described by
expanding the function A(ω) in powers of ω − ωr(x). For
frequencies that diﬀer substantially from the local char-
acteristic frequency, on the other hand, we expect the
active system to contribute little to the BM response. In
particular, when ω = 0, the BM deﬂection is governed
only by its passive stiﬀness, according to Eq. (4). We
now assert that the simple functional form

A(x, ω) = α(ωr(x) − ω)

,

(7)

where α is a real constant, captures the essential features
of this BM response. Clearly it satisﬁes the requirement

2

that the linear response coeﬃcient at location x can be
expanded about ωr(x). Secondly, it indicates that the
passive stiﬀness is proportional to the characteristic fre-
quency: K(x) = A(x, 0) = αωr(x). This corresponds
well with experimental data. The frequency-place map
and the elasticity of the BM have been carefully mea-
sured. Characteristic frequency and stiﬀness both de-
crease approximately exponentially with distance along
the cochlea, falling by about two orders of magnitude
from base to apex [2, 18]. We therefore supplement Eqs.
(6) & (7) with

ωr(x) = ω0e

−x/d

,

(8)

to obtain the full position-dependent response of the BM.
We take the coeﬃcient B, describing the nonlinearity
close to resonance, to be a purely imaginary constant,
B = iβ. This simple choice ensures that Eq. (6) has no
spontaneously oscillating solution for ˜p = 0, as required
at the critical point.

Active traveling waves.—Combining Eq. (3) for the BM
acceleration with the response of an active membrane,
described by Eq. (6), we obtain a nonlinear wave equation
for the BM deformation. In frequency representation, it
reads

−2ρbω2˜h = ∂x

A(x, ω)˜h + B|˜h|2˜h

.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)i

The complex solutions of this equation ˜h(x) = H(x)eiφ(x)
describe the amplitude H and the phase φ of the BM dis-
placement elicited by a periodic stimulus with incoming
sound pressure p(x = 0, t) = ˜p(0)eiωt.

For small pressures, the nonlinearity described by the
cubic term in Eq. (9) is signiﬁcant only close to the res-
onant place which, inverting Eq. (8), is xr = d ln(ω0/ω).
Far from this characteristic place, we obtain a linear wave
equation which can be solved in the WKB approximation
[14, 16]. The approximate solution can be expressed as

(11)

At the basal end of the cochlea, x < xr, q is real and the
solution is a traveling wave with a position-dependent
wave vector. As the wave propagates, its wavelength di-
minishes and its amplitude builds up, until it approaches
the place of resonance. In the immediate vicinity of the
characteristic place, A decreases according to Eq. (7)
while ˜h increases. Thus the cubic term in Eq. (9) rapidly
becomes more important than the linear term. This cuts
oﬀ the divergence in Eq. (10) and leads to a strongly
nonlinear BM response. The wave peaks at x = xp < xr,

where the response displays the characteristic nonlinear-
ity of critical oscillators, ˜h(xp) ∼ ˜p(xp)1/3 [10, 11]. From
Eq. (10) we ﬁnd that ˜p(xp) ∼ A(xp)1/4 ˜p(0), while the
crossover from linear to nonlinear response implies that
A(xp) ∼ |B||˜h(xp)|2. We thus ﬁnd that the peak ampli-
tude has a power law response

h(xp) ∼ p(0)ν

(12)

as a function of the stimulus pressure at the base, with an
exponent ν = 0.4. At positions beyond the characteristic
place, x > xr, the wave vector q becomes imaginary,
indicating the breakdown of wave propagation. The BM
displacement decays very sharply in this regime.

Numerical solutions.—Full solutions to the nonlinear
wave equation, Eq. (9), can be obtained numerically. It
is most convenient to solve the equation for the pressure
˜p(x) which satisﬁes

−µ˜p = (A + Bu(˜p))∂2

x ˜p ,

(13)

with µ = 2ρω2/l and where we have assumed for sim-
plicity that b and l are constant along the cochlea. The
variable u = H 2 is the squared deformation amplitude
and is a nonlinear function of ˜p. Indeed, it follows from
Eq. (6) that u(˜p) is the unique real and positive root of
the cubic equation

∗
|˜p|2 = |A|2u + (A

B + AB

)u2 + |B|2u3

.

∗

(14)

Eq. (13) for ˜p can be solved, starting from x = L and
integrating towards x = 0. As a boundary condition,
we impose zero pressure diﬀerence at the helicotrema,
˜p(L) = 0, because the two cochlear channels are con-
nected there. A second boundary condition speciﬁes the
value of ∂x ˜p at x = L. By varying this pressure gradient
at the helicotrema, we ﬁnd solutions that correspond to
waves entering the cochlea at x = 0 with diﬀerent pres-
sure amplitudes ˜p(0). The proﬁle of BM displacements
can then be obtained from the solution ˜p(x) via

˜h =

˜p
A + Bu(˜p)

.

Basilar membrane response.—Examples of traveling
waves are displayed in Fig. 1 for two diﬀerent sound lev-
els and varying stimulus frequencies. Waves initiated at
x = 0 propagate with growing amplitude and decreasing
wavelength until they reach a point of resonance, beyond
which they decay rapidly. At 40 dB SPL, the resonance
is sharp and the peak response occurs at a location very
close to the characteristic place x = xr, where the fre-
quency of the active oscillators is equal to the stimulus
frequency. At 80 dB SPL, the resonance is much broader
and the location x = xp of maximal response shifts to-
wards the base, in agreement with experimental observa-
tions [6].

The response at a particular location on the BM ex-
hibits the qualitative properties of cochlear tuning that

one free parameter in our calculations, β = 1023 Pa/m3, which

plays the gain ω|˜h|/|˜p(0)| of BM velocity, obtained from
our numerical solutions, as a function of stimulus fre-
quency for diﬀerent sound levels. At low frequencies the
response is linear and the gain is independent of the stim-
ulus amplitude. As the stimulus frequency approaches
the resonant frequency, the response becomes nonlinear
and the gain diverges as the SPL declines. At higher
frequencies, the response drops precipitously. The mag-
nitude of the BM displacement, shown in Fig. 2b, is typ-
ically several nanometers at resonance, in quantitative
agreement with experimental data [4]. The phase φ of
the traveling wave at a particular location on the BM is

creases with increasing frequency — gradually at ﬁrst,
but more abruptly as resonance is approached — and
then varies only little at frequencies higher than the char-
acteristic frequency.

Discussion.—In many recent cochlear models, sections
of the BM are considered to behave as inertial oscilla-
tors which are either lightly damped (in passive models)
[14, 15, 16] or driven by internal forces (in active models)
[19, 20, 21]. The characteristic frequency at a particular
location is then the local resonant frequency of the BM,
which varies as the square root of the stiﬀness. A prob-

4

lem with this interpretation is that, in order to obtain the
observed range of characteristic frequencies, the stiﬀness
of the BM would have to vary by more than four orders of
magnitude from base to apex. The measured variation is
only a factor of one hundred [2, 22]. This diﬃculty is cir-
cumvented by our theory, where the range of frequencies
at which the BM resonates is determined by the frequen-
cies of the oscillators that are ranged along it, and is not
governed by the stiﬀness or the inertia. Some models of
the active cochlea are very speciﬁc and rely on additional
degrees of freedom, secondary resonances or time-delayed
feedbacks [21]. Such descriptions lack the simplicity and
generality of our approach and miss the generic nature
of the power-law nonlinearities [10, 11, 23] conferred by
the Hopf bifurcation.

In this letter it has been our aim to provide a concise,
coherent interpretation of a wide variety of observations,
rather than a detailed ﬁt of individual data. Consider-
ing that our model incorporates only one free parame-
ter whose value is not determined by independent mea-
surement, the qualitative agreement with a diverse set
of experimental data is striking. We have not sought to
specify the physical nature of the active oscillators. The
electromotility of outer hair cells has been implicated in
active ampliﬁcation in the mammalian cochlea [1, 24, 25],
but the motile response of hair bundles may also play a
role. Indeed, the hair bundles of frog hair cells have re-
cently been demonstrated to behave as Hopf oscillators
[26, 27]. Because the response of self-tuned critical oscil-
lators is generic, our analysis remains valid whatever the
physical basis of force generation.

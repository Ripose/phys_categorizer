Abstract. Electrostatic interaction between ions in an ionic channel and the charge
ﬂuctuations in the channel mouth are considered.
It is shown that the charge ﬂuctuations
can be enhanced in the channels with low dielectric constant and result in strong modulation
of the potential barrier at the selectivity site. The eﬀect of charge ﬂuctuational on transition
probabilities in other molecular dynamical systems is brieﬂy discussed.

1. Introduction
Electrostatic interactions and ﬂuctuations play crucial role in controlling transition probabilities,
conduction and selectivity in nanoscale molecular systems. It is also well-know that the long-
range Coulomb interaction leads to the strong correlation of ions motion and is responsible for
the ions distribution and the energy ﬂuctuations in electrolytes [9, 7]. However, in traditional
approach to the calculations of the escape rates in molecular biology the charge ﬂuctuations
in the bulk are usually neglected [6].
In this paper the eﬀect of charge ﬂuctuations on the
probabilities of transition of ions through an open ionic channel is considered.

Speciﬁcally, we consider ion transport across lipid membrane with small dielectric constant.
The motion is described as a self-consistent solution of the coupled Poisson and Langevin
equations for ions moving in an open ionic channel [3, 4]. The distribution of ions arrival time
and the charge ﬂuctuations at the channel mouth are investigated numerically and compared
to the theoretical predictions. Next, the electrostatic energy proﬁle of one ion in an aqueous
channel through a lipid membrane charged at the selectivity site is calculated. Finally, we
consider the electrostatic coupling between the charge ﬂuctuations in the channel mouth and
the energy ﬂuctuations for the ion at the selectivity site.

It is shown that the volume charge ﬂuctuations in the channel mouth can be modeled as a
generalized short noise and result in the strong modulation of the potential barrier for an ion
at the selectivity site at the sub-nanosecond time scale.
It is further demonstrated that the
enhanced by the channel modulation of the potential barrier is much larger as compared to the
energy of Coulomb interaction between ion in the channel mouth and the ion at the selectivity
site. We therefore argue that open ionic channels can be viewed as electrostatic ampliﬁers

of the charge ﬂuctuations. An analytical approximation to the eﬀect of ampliﬁcation of the
electrostatic interaction between the ions in the channel is provided.

2. Method
The system considered is made of three compartments of equal size. The middle block constitutes
the protein through which there is a cylindrical hole representing an approximation of an open
channel. The channel is bathed by a solution of NaCl on its left and right ends. The electrostatic
force and potential are produced by the moving ion and ﬁxed charge at the surface, particularly
the net negative charge bared by a fraction of the protein at the channels selectivity ﬁlter. The
Poisson equation is solved in 3D space with cylindrical symmetry. The electrical sources are
the ﬁxed negative charge on the protein and the ions located on the channel axis. Since the
dielectric value of the aqueous pore is not yet known for narrow channels, as ﬁrst approximation,
we use the same dielectric value as for the aqueous bath ǫ2 = 80. The dielectric value of the
protein is taken to be equal to ǫ1 = 2.

The motion of the ions is modeled within a self-consistent framework of Brownian dynamics

(BD) coupled to the Poisson equation.

In the Brownian
dynamics simulations, water molecules are not taken into account explicitly and are represented
in Eq. (1), by an average frictional force with a friction coeﬃcient miγi and a stochastic
force √2miγikBT ~ξi(t) arising from random collisions. The long range Coulomb interaction is
represented by the 1/r potential. The addition of the pairwise repulsive 1/r9 soft-core interaction
potential insures that ions of opposite charge, attracted by the inter-ion Coulomb force, do not
collide and annihilate each other. rij is the distance between ions i and j. U0 and Rc are
respectively the overall strength of the potential and the contact distance between ions pairs [8].

and the electric ﬁeld. An eﬀective dielectric constant is introduced at the interface between
water and the protein. The later procedure is more appropriate when the dielectric function
present severe jump. In order to preserve the system symmetrical symmetry, the moving ion is
bound to move on the channel axis. Dirichlet boundary condition is used to ﬁx the value of the
electrostatic potential at the left and right boundaries of the system as used in experimental
measurement. Neumann boundary condition is used to set the value of the normal component of
the electric ﬁeld. Standard iterative method is used to solve algebraic linear system grown from
discrete Poisson equation. The results are stored in tables allowing for the fast self-consistent
BD simulations.

3. Distribution of arrival times and the charge ﬂuctuations
In this research we are focused on estimating the eﬀect of the charge ﬂuctuations on the transition
probabilities of the ions through an open ionic channel. To this end we would like to calculate
how much time ions spend in the channel mouth and how often do the arrive to the channel
mouth. Estimation of arrival time of ions at the channel mouth from a solution assuming charge
neutrality and no applied ﬁeld can be obtained by considering pure diﬀusion of ions through
the hemisphere at the mouth of the channel and is given by τar = 1/(2πzi
Dirc0); where r is
the Avogadro number, zi and Di the charge

To estimate the charge ﬂuctuations from the simulations we have recorded continuously

4. Ampliﬁcation of the electrostatic interaction between two ions in the channel
We now consider the eﬀect of the charge ﬂuctuations on the transition probabilities of the ions
through an open ionic channel. First, we analyze the energy proﬁle faced by one ion moving
through the channel.

The total electrostatic energy required to move one ion from the bulk solution to a bare
channel that is 30 ˚Along and 4 ˚Ain radius as a function of the position of the ion is calculated
as shown in the Fig. 2(a). The potential drop across the channel is ∆Φ = 90 mV, the charge
at the selectivity site (at the middle of the channel) is -1e. Note that the value of the potential
barrier for the ion at the selectivity site to exit the channel is ∆E0 as shown in the Fig. 2 (b).
We now consider the reduction of this potential barrier induced by the second ion situated at
the channel mouth. The total energy of the channel as a function of the position of the ﬁrst
ion moving along the channel when the second ion is located at the channel mouth is shown in
the Fig. 2(b) by dashed line. It can be seen that the presence of a second ion at the channel
entrance decreases the energy barrier to ∆E1. We note the reduction of the potential barrier
from ∆E0 to ∆E1 is much stronger in the channel with low dielectric constant. I.e. the eﬀect
of charge ﬂuctuation is strongly enhanced by the protein low dielectric constant compared to

the contribution from the four terms in the right hand side can be considered independently.
Here we concentrate on the interaction between two ions in the channel in the absence of any
external ﬁeld and therefore leave only the two last terms in the eq. (4) (see, however, for the
full analytical solution of the Poisson equation elsewhere).

6. Conclusion
It was shown that the energy ﬂuctuations due to the correlation of the motion between ions in
strong electrolytes can be substantially enhanced in the open ionic channels with low dielectric
constant. Therefore, ion channels can be taught of as electrostatic ampliﬁers of the charge
ﬂuctuations. This in turn may lead to an exponentially strong modulation of the potential barrier
for the ion at the selectivity site. The resulting enhancement of the transition probabilities of
ions through open ionic channels can be leading order contribution to the transition probabilities
calculated using standard theories that neglect the eﬀect of charge ﬂuctuations. The eﬀect of
electrostatic ampliﬁcation of the charge ﬂuctuations may play substantial role in the nanoscale
protein dynamics, including, in particular, protein folding.

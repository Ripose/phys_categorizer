Abstract– This paper considers the problem of match-
ing fragment to organism using its complete genome. Our
method is based on the probability measure representation of
a genome. We ﬁrst demonstrate that these probability mea-
sures can be modelled as recurrent iterated function systems
(RIFS) consisting of four contractive similarities. Our hy-
pothesis is that the multifractal characteristic of the probabil-
ity measure of a complete genome, as captured by the RIFS,
is preserved in its reasonably long fragments. We compute
the RIFS of fragments of various lengths and random start-
ing points, and compare with that of the original sequence
for recognition using the Euclidean distance. A demonstra-
tion on ﬁve randomly selected organisms supports the above
hypothesis.

I. INTRODUCTION

The DNA sequences of complete genomes provide es-
sential information for understanding gene functions and
evolution. A large number of these DNA sequences is cur-
rently available in public databases such as Genbank at
ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/ or KEGG at
http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/java/org list.html). A
great challenge of DNA analysis is to determine the in-
trinsic patterns contained in these sequences which are
formed by four basic nucleotides, namely, adenine (a),
cytosine (c), guanine (g) and thymine (t).

Some signiﬁcant contribution results have been ob-
tained for the long-range correlation in DNA sequences
[1-16]. Li et al. [1] found that the spectral density of a
DNA sequence containing mostly introns shows 1/f β be-
haviour, which indicates the presence of long-range cor-
relation when 0 < β < 1. The correlation properties of

coding and noncoding DNA sequences were ﬁrst studied
by Peng et al. [2] in their fractal landscape or DNA walk
model. The DNA walk [2] was deﬁned as that the walker
steps “up” if a pyrimidine (c or t) occurs at position i
along the DNA chain, while the walker steps “down” if a
purine (a or g) occurs at position i. Peng et al. [2] discov-
ered that there exists long-range correlation in noncoding
DNA sequences while the coding sequences correspond to
a regular random walk. By undertaking a more detailed
analysis, Chatzidimitriou et al. [5] concluded that both
coding and noncoding sequences exhibit long-range cor-
relation. A subsequent work by Prabhu and Claverie [6]
also substantially corroborates these results. If one con-
siders more details by distinguishing c from t in pyrim-
idine, and a from g in purine (such as two or three-
dimensional DNA walk models [15] and maps given by
Yu and Chen [16]), then the presence of base correlation
has been found even in coding sequences. On the other
hand, Buldyrev et al. [12] showed that long-range corre-
lation appears mainly in noncoding DNA using all the
DNA sequences available. Based on equal-symbol cor-
relation, Voss [8] showed a power law behaviour for the
sequences studied regardless of the proportion of intron
contents. These studies add to the controversy about
the possible presence of correlation in the entire DNA or
only in the noncoding DNA. From a diﬀerent angle, frac-
tal analysis has proven useful in revealing complex pat-
terns in natural objects. Berthelsen et al. [17] considered
the global fractal dimensions of human DNA sequences
treated as pseudorandom walks.

In the above studies, the authors only considered short
or long DNA segments. Since the ﬁrst complete genome
of the free-living bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium was
sequenced in 1995 [18], an ever-growing number of com-
plete genomes has been deposited in public databases.
The availability of complete genomes induces the pos-
sibility to establish some global properties of these se-
quences. Vieira [19] carried out a low-frequency analy-
sis of the complete DNA of 13 microbial genomes and
showed that their fractal behaviour does not always pre-
vail through the entire chain and the autocorrelation
functions have a rich variety of behaviours including the
presence of anti-persistence. Yu and Wang [20] pro-
posed a time series model of coding sequences in com-
plete genomes. For fuller details on the number, size and
ordering of genes along the chromosome, one can refer to
Part 5 of Lewin [21]. One may ignore the composition of
the four kinds of bases in coding and noncoding segments

and only consider the global structure of the complete
genomes or long DNA sequences. Provata and Almiran-
tis [22] proposed a fractal Cantor pattern of DNA. They
mapped coding segments to ﬁlled regions and noncoding
segments to empty regions of a random Cantor set and
then calculated the fractal dimension of this set. They
found that the coding/noncoding partition in DNA se-
quences of lower organisms is homogeneous-like, while in
the higher eucariotes the partition is fractal. This result
doesn’t seem reﬁned enough to distinguish bacteria be-
cause the fractal dimensions of bacteria computed [22] are
all the same. The classiﬁcation and evolution relation-
ship of bacteria is one of the most important problems
in DNA research. Yu and Anh [23] proposed a time se-
ries model based on the global structure of the complete
genome and considered three kinds of length sequences.
After calculating the correlation dimensions and Hurst
exponents, it was found that one can get more informa-
tion from this model than that of fractal Cantor pattern.
Some results on the classiﬁcation and evolution relation-
ship of bacteria were found [23]. The correlation property
of these length sequences has been discussed [24]. The
multifractal analysis for these length sequences was done
in [25].

Although statistical analysis performed directly on
DNA sequences has yielded some success, there has been
some indication that this method is not powerful enough
to amplify the diﬀerence between a DNA sequence and a
random sequence as well as to distinguish DNA sequences
themselves in more details [26]. One needs more powerful
global and visual methods. For this purpose, Hao et al.
[26] proposed a visualisation method based on counting
and coarse-graining the frequency of appearance of sub-
strings with a given length. They called it the portrait of
an organism. They found that there exist some fractal
patterns in the portraits which are induced by avoiding
and under-represented strings. The fractal dimension of
the limit set of portraits was also discussed [27,28]. There
are other graphical methods of sequence patterns, such
as chaos game representation [29,30].

Yu et al. [31] introduced a representation of a DNA se-
quence by a probability measure of k-strings derived from
the sequence. This probability measure is in fact the his-
togram of the events formed by all the k-strings in a dic-
tionary ordering. It was found [31] that these probability
measures display a distinct multifractal behaviour char-
acterised by their generalised R´enyi dimensions (instead
of a single fractal dimension as in the case of self-similar
processes). Furthermore, the corresponding Cq curves
(deﬁned in [32]) of these generalised dimensions of all
bacteria resemble classical phase transition at a critical
point, while the “analogous” phase transitions (deﬁned
in [32]) of chromosomes of nonbacteria exhibit the shape
of double-peaked speciﬁc heat function. These patterns
led to a meaningful grouping of archaebacteria, eubac-
teria and eukaryote. Anh et al. [33] took a further step
in providing a theory to characterise the multifractality
of the probability measures of the complete genomes. In

particular, the resulting parametric models ﬁt extremely
well the Dq curves of the generalised dimensions and the
corresponding Kq curves of the above probability mea-
sures of the complete genomes.

A conclusion of the work reported in Yu et al. [31] and
Anh et al. [33] is that the histogram of the k-strings of
the complete genome provides a good representation of
the genome and that these probability measures are mul-
tifractal. This multifractality is, in most cases studied,
characteristic of the DNA sequences, hence can be used
for their classiﬁcation.

In this paper, we consider the problem of recognition
of an organism based on fragments of their DNA se-
quences. The identiﬁcation of the organisms in a cul-
ture commonly relies on their molecular identity markers
such as the genes that code for ribosomal RNA. How-
ever, it is usual that most fragments lack the marker,
“making the task of matching fragment to organism akin
to reconstructing a document that has been shredded”
(M. Leslie, “Tales of the sea”, New Scientist, 27 January
2001). A well-known method to tackle the task is the
random shotgun sequencing method, which scans the se-
quences of all fragments looking for overlaps to be able
to piece the fragments together. It is obvious that this
technique is extremely time-consuming and many crucial
fragments may be missing.

This paper will provide a diﬀerent method to approach
this problem. Our starting point is the probability mea-
sure of the k-strings and its multifractality. We model
this multifractality using a recurrent iterated function
system ( [34,35]) consisting of four contractive similarities
(to be described in Section IV). This branching number
of four is a natural consequence of the four basic elements
(a, c, g, t) of the DNA sequences. Each of these RIFS is
speciﬁed by a matrix of incidence probabilities P = (pij ),
i, j = 1, ..., 4, with pi1+pi2+pi3+pi4 = 1 for i = 1, ..., 4. It
is our hypothesis that, for reasonably-long fragments, the
multifractal characteristic of the measure of a complete
genome as captured by the matrix P is preserved in the
fragments. We thus represent each fragment by a vec-
tor ( 1
4 (p12 + p22 + p32 + p42)
, 1
+. We will see that, for
fragments of lengths longer than 1/20 of the original se-
quence and with random starting points, these vectors
are very close, using the Euclidean distance, to the vec-
tor of the complete sequence.

4 (p11 + p21 + p31 + p41) , 1
4 ( p13 + p23 + p33 + p43) in R3

We will demonstrate the technique on ﬁve organisms,
namely, A. fulgidus, B. burgdorferi, C. trachomatis, E.
coli and M. genitalium. As remarked in Yu et al. [31],
substrings of length k = 6 are suﬃcient to represent
DNA sequences. For each organism, we compute the his-
tograms for the 6-strings of its complete genome, and 4
cases of fragments of lengths 1/4, 1/8, 1/15 and 1/20
of the complete sequence. The starting position of each
fragment is chosen randomly. The RIFS of the complete
genome and each of the fragments are computed next.
The numerical results are reported in Section V. Some

conclusions will be drawn in Section VI.

II. MEASURE REPRESENTATION OF
COMPLETE GENOMES

We ﬁrst outline the method of Yu et al. [31] in deriv-
ing the measure representation of a DNA sequence. We
call any string made up of k letters from the set {g, c, a, t}
a k-string. For a given k there are in total 4k diﬀerent
k-strings. In order to count the number of each kind of k-
strings in a given DNA sequence, 4k counters are needed.
We divide the interval [0, 1) into 4k disjoint subintervals,
and use each subinterval to represent a counter. Letting
s = s1 · · · sk, si ∈ {a, c, g, t}, i = 1, · · · , k, be a substring
with length k, we deﬁne

where

and

xl(s) =

k

if si = a,
if si = c,
if si = g,
if si = t,

xi = 




xr(s) = xl(s) +

1
4k .

We then use the subinterval [xl(s), xr(s)) to represent
substring s. Let N (s) be the times of substring s ap-
pearing in the complete genome. If the number of bases
in the complete genome is L, we deﬁne

F (s) = N (s)/(L − k + 1)

(4)

to be the frequency of substring s.

It follows that
{s} F (s) = 1. We can now view F (s) as a function

of x and deﬁne a measure µk on [0, 1) by
P

µk (x) = Yk (x) dx,

where

Yk(x) = 4kFk(s),

x ∈ [xl(s), xr(s)).

(5)

We then have µk ([0, 1)) = 1 and µk ([xl(s), xr(s))) =
Fk(s). We call µk (x) the measure representation of an
organism. As an example, the measure representation
of M. genitalium for k = 3, ..., 6 is given in FIG. 1. A
fractal-like behaviour is apparent in the measures.

Remark: The ordering of a, c, g, t in (2) follows
the natural dictionary ordering of k-strings in the one-
dimensional space. A diﬀerent ordering of a, c, g, t would
change the nature of the correlations of the measure. But
in our case, a diﬀerent ordering of a, c, g, t in Eq. (2)
gives the same multifractal spectrum (Dq curve which will

be deﬁned in the next section) when the absolute value
of q is relatively small (see FIG. 2 in [31]). Hence the
multifractal characteristic is independent of the ordering.
In the comparison of diﬀerent organisms using the mea-
sure representation, once the ordering of a, c, g, t in (2)
is given, it is ﬁxed for all organisms [31].

III. MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS

The most common algorithms of multifractal anal-
ysis are the so-called ﬁxed-size box-counting algorithms
[36]. In the one-dimensional case, for a given measure µ
with support E ⊂ R, we consider the partition sum

Zǫ(q) =

[µ(B)]q,

Xµ(B)6=0
q ∈ R, where the sum runs over all diﬀerent nonempty
boxes B of a given side ǫ in a grid covering of the support
E, that is,

B = [kǫ, (k + 1)ǫ[.

The exponent τ (q) is deﬁned by

τ (q) = lim
ǫ→0

log Zǫ(q)
log ǫ

and the generalized fractal dimensions of the measure are
deﬁned as

Dq = τ (q)/(q − 1),

for q 6= 1,

and

Dq = lim
ǫ→0

Z1,ǫ
log ǫ

,

for q = 1,

(10)

µ(B)6=0 µ(B) log µ(B). The generalized
where Z1,ǫ =
fractal dimensions are estimated through a linear regres-
sion of

P

1
q − 1

log Zǫ(q)

against log ǫ for q 6= 1, and similarly through a linear
regression of Z1,ǫ against log ǫ for q = 1. D1 is called in-
formation dimension and D2 is called correlation dimen-
sion. The Dq of the positive values of q give relevance
to the regions where the measure is large, i.e., to the
k-strings with high probability. The Dq of the negative
values of q deal with the structure and the properties of
the most rareﬁed regions of the measure.

IV. IFS AND RIFS MODELS AND THE
MOMENT METHOD FOR PARAMETER
ESTIMATION

In this paper, we propose to model the measure
deﬁned in Section II for a complete genome by a recur-
rent IFS. As we work with measures on compact inter-
vals, the theory of Section II is narrowed down to the

one-dimensional case (i.e. d = 1). Consider a system of
contractive maps S = {S1, S2, · · · , SN }. Let E0 be a com-
pact interval of R, Eσ1σ2···σn = Sσ1 ◦ Sσ2 ◦ · · · ◦ Sσn (E0)
and

En = ∪σ1,···,σn∈{1,2,···,N }Eσ1σ2···σn .

Then E = ∩∞
a set of probabilities pi > 0,
x0 ∈ E and deﬁne iteratively the sequence

n=1En is the attractor of the IFS. Given
N
i=1 pi = 1, we pick an

P

xn+1 = Sσn (xn),

n = 0, 1, 2, · · · ,

(11)

where the indices σn are chosen randomly and inde-
pendently from the set {1, 2, · · · , N } with probabilities
P (σn = i) = pi. Then every orbit {xn} is dense in the
attractor E [37,38]. For n large enough, we can view the
orbit {x0, x1, · · · , xn} as an approximation of E. This
iterative process is called a chaos game.

a

Given

contractive
maps S = {S1, S2, · · · , SN } on a compact metric space
E∗, we associate with these maps a matrix of probabil-
ities P = (pij) such that
j pij = 1, i = 1, 2, · · · , N .
Consider a random sequence generated by a chaos game:
P

of

xn+1 = Sσn (xn), n = 0, 1, 2, · · · ,

(12)

where x0 is any starting point and σn is chosen with a
probability that depends on the previous index σn−1:

P (σn+1 = i) = pσn,i.

(13)

The choice of the indices σn as prescribed by (13) presents
a fundamental diﬀerence between this iterative process
and that deﬁned by (11) of the usual chaos game. Then
(E∗, S, P) is called a recurrent IFS. The ﬂexibility of
RIFS permits the construction of more general sets and
measures which do not have to exhibit the strict self-
similarity of IFS. This would oﬀer a more suitable frame-
work to model fractal-like objects and measures in na-
ture.

Let µ be the invariant measure on the attractor E of
an IFS or RIFS, χB the characteristic function for the
Borel subset B ⊂ E; then from the ergodic theorem for
IFS or RIFS [37],

[
µ(B) = lim

(14)

In other words, µ(B) is the relative visitation frequency
of B during the chaos game. A histogram approxima-
tion of the invariant measure may then be obtained by
counting the number of visits made to each pixel on the
computer screen.

The coeﬃcients in the contractive maps and the prob-
abilities in the IFS or RIFS model are the parameters
to be estimated for a given measure which we want to
simulate. Vrscay [38] introduced a moment method to
perform this task. If µ is the invariant measure and E

the attractor of the IFS or RIFS in R, the moments of µ
are

g0 =

If Si(x) = cix + di, i = 1, · · · , N , then the following

Thus, setting g0 = 1, the moments gn, n ≥ 1, may be

[38].

For the RIFS model, we have

gn =

If we denote by Gk the moments obtained directly from

(17-19) for the RIFS model, then through solving the
optimal problem

for some chosen n,

we can obtain the estimates of the parameters in the IFS

From the measure representation of a complete

genome, it is natural to choose N = 4 and

S1(x) = x/4, S2(x) = x/4 + 1/4,
S3(x) = x/4 + 1/2, S4(x) = x/4 + 3/4

in the IFS or RIFS model. Based on the estimated values
of the probabilities, we can use the chaos game to gener-
ate a histogram approximation of the invariant measure
of the IFS or RIFS, which then can be compared with
the given measure of the complete genome.

V. APPLICATION TO THE RECOGNITION
PROBLEM

The measure representations for a large number of
complete genomes, as described in Section II, were ob-
tained in Yu et al.
[31]. It was found that substrings
with k = 6 seem to provide a limiting measure that can
be used for the classiﬁcation and recognition of DNA se-
quences. Hence we will use 6-strings in this paper. We
then estimated their IFS and RIFS models using the mo-
ment method described in Section 4. The chaos game
algorithm was next performed to generate an orbit as in
(11) or (12) with (13). From these orbits, simulated ap-
proximations of the invariant measures of IFS or RIFS
were obtained via the ergodic theorem (14). In order to
clarify how close the simulated measure is to the original
measure, we convert a measure to its walk representa-
tion: We denote by {tj, j = 1, 2, · · · , 4k} the density
of a measure and tave its average, then deﬁne the walk
j
k=1(tk − tave), j = 1, 2, · · · , 4k. The two walks
Tj =
of the given measure and the measure generated by the
chaos game of an IFS or RIFS are then plotted in the
same ﬁgure for comparison. We found that RIFS is a
better model to simulate complete genomes. We deter-
mine the ”goodness” of the measure simulated from the
RIFS model relative to the original measure based on the
following relative standard error (RSE)

measure and the RIFS simulated measure respectively.
The goodness of ﬁt is indicated by the result RSE < 1.
For example, the RIFS simulation of 6-strings measure
representation of M. genitalium is shown in the left ﬁgure
of FIG. 2, and the walk of its original 6-strings measure
representation and that simulated from the correspond-
ing RIFS are shown in the right ﬁgure of FIG. 2. For the
whole genome, RM SE = 0.00020675, SE = 0.0003207
and RSD = 0.6447 < 1.
It is seen that the RIFS
simulation ﬁts the original measure very well.

We next pick out ﬁve organisms (without any partic-
ular a priori reason) from about 50 organisms whose
complete genomes are currently available. These are A.
fulgidus, B. burgdorferi, C. trachomatis, E. coli and M.
genitalium. Fragments of diﬀerent length rates ranging

5

from 1/20 to 1/4 and with random starting points along
the sequences were then selected. Here the length rate
of a fragment means the length of this fragment divided
by the length of the genome of the same organism. For
example, the measure representations of diﬀerent frag-
ments of M. genitalium are shown in FIG. 3. The RIFS
model for each of these fragments was next estimated.
We also show the RIFS simulation of the 6-strings mea-
sure representation of the 1/20 fragment of M. genital-
ium in the left ﬁgure of FIG. 4. The walk of its original
6-strings measure representation and that of RIFS sim-
ulation are shown in the right ﬁgure of FIG. 4. For this
fragment, RM SE = 0.00023169, SE = 0.00035475 and
RSD = 0.6531 < 1. Again, the RIFS simulation ﬁts
the original measure of this fragment very well.

It should be noted that column i in the matrix P de-
scribes the activity of similarity Si in each RIFS. To be
able to represent each fragment on a three-dimensional
plot, we deﬁne

P1 = (p11 + p21 + p31 + p41)/4,
P2 = (p12 + p22 + p32 + p42)/4,
P3 = (p13 + p23 + p33 + p43)/4.

then represented by the vector
Each fragment
(P1, P2, P3) . The values of these vectors are provided in
Table I, and the vectors are plotted in FIG. 5. It is seen
that the vectors of the fragments from the same organism
cluster together, and this clustering holds for all selected
lengths. This accuracy is uniform for all ﬁve organisms
randomly selected.

In matching a fragment to organism, the Dq curve,
which depicts the generalised dimension of the invariant
measure as described in Section III, can also be used.
We computed these curves for the above ﬁve organisms
at a variety of length sizes, to 1/100th of the original se-
quence. The results were reported for M. genitalium in
FIG. 6. It is seen that this method also performs very
well. However, it suﬀers a drawback that many diﬀer-
ent organisms seem to have the same or closely related
Dq curve. In this sense, the method based on the RIFS
has higher resolution in distinguishing the genomes. If
necessary, the entire matrix P may be used, instead of
(21), in this comparison. This would enhance the match-
ing, but will not be as economical as (21). Yu et al. [39]
used the entire matrix P to deﬁne the distance between
two organisms in higher dimensional space and then the
evolutionary tree of more than 50 organisms was con-
structed. The RIFS model can also be used to simulate
the measure representation of proteins based on the HP
model [40].

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper provides a method for matching fragment
to organism taking advantage of the multifractal charac-
teristic of the measure representation of their genomes. It

was demonstrated empirically that the underlying mech-
anism of this multifractality can be captured by a recur-
rent IFS, whose theory is well founded in the fractal ge-
ometry literature. Fast algorithms for the computation of
these RIFS and related quantities as well as tools for com-
parison are available. The method seems to work reason-
ably well with low computing cost. This fast and econom-
ical method can be performed at a preliminary stage to
cluster fragments before a more extensive method, such
as the random shotgun sequencing method as mentioned
in the Introduction, is decided to be brought in for higher
accuracy.

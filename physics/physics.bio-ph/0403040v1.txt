ABSTRACT

Recent experiments with amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide suggest that formation of

toxic oligomers may be an important contribution to the onset of Alzheimer’s

disease. The toxicity of Aβ oligomers depends on their structure, which is

governed by assembly dynamics. Due to limitations of current experimental

techniques, a detailed knowledge of oligomer structure at the atomic level is

missing. We introduce a molecular dynamics approach to study Aβ dimer for-

mation: (1) we use discrete molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse–grained

model to identify a variety of dimer conformations, and (2) we employ all-atom

molecular mechanics simulations to estimate the thermodynamic stability of all

dimer conformations. Our simulations of a coarse–grained Aβ peptide model

predicts ten diﬀerent planar β-strand dimer conformations. We then estimate

the free energies of all dimer conformations in all-atom molecular mechanics

simulations with explicit water. We compare the free energies of Aβ(1–42)

and Aβ(1–40) dimers. We ﬁnd that (a) all dimer conformations have higher

free energies compared to their corresponding monomeric states, and (b) the

free energy diﬀerence between the Aβ(1–42) and the analogous Aβ(1–40)

dimer conformation is not signiﬁcant. Our results suggest that Aβ oligomer-

ization is not accompanied by the formation of stable planar β-strand Aβ dimers.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is neuropathologically characterized by progressive neuronal

loss, extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Yankner, 1996;

Selkoe, 1997). Fibrillar amyloid plaques, a result of Aβ peptide aggregation, have been

implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Recent experimental studies on Aβ peptide (Lambert

et al., 1998; El-Agnaf et al., 2000; El-Agnaf et al., 2001; Dahlgren et al., 2002) as well

as various animal model studies (Hsia et al., 1999; Mucke et al., 2000; Dodart et al., 2002;

Westerman et al., 2002; Walsh et al., 2002) suggest that soluble forms of Aβ assemblies cause

substantial neuronal dysfunction even before the appearance of amyloid plaques. Hence,

ﬁnding the conformation of these oligomeric forms of Aβ may be important for understanding

of neurotoxicity in AD (Kirkitadze et al., 2002; Klein et al., 2001; Klein, 2002a; Klein, 2002b;

Bucciantini et al., 2002; Kayed et al., 2003). At present, the precise nature, conformation,

and time evolution from monomer Aβ peptides into intermediates is still unknown.

The ﬁbrillar structure of Aβ peptide aggregates is relatively well established. Experiments

have targeted the structure of Aβ ﬁbrils using electron microscopy (Malinchik et al., 1998;

Tjernberg et al., 1999; Tjernberg et al., 2002), X-ray diﬀraction (Malinchik et al., 1998;

Serpell et al., 2000), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (T¨or¨ok et al., 2002) and

solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Balbach et al., 2002; Petkova et al.,

2002; Antzutkin et al., 2002; Thompson, 2003; Antzutkin et al., 2003). The most common

view is that Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) in ﬁbrils form parallel β-sheets with a β-turn between

residues Asp 23 and Lys 28. The most ﬂexible regions of the peptide in a ﬁbril are the ﬁrst

10 amino acids of the N-terminus, last few amino acids of the C-terminus (residues 39-42),

and the β-turn region between residues 23 and 28 (Petkova et al., 2002; T¨or¨ok et al., 2002).

The aggregation process from a monomer Aβ peptide via soluble oligomeric states to

ﬁbrils is a complex dynamic event which depends critically on the peptide concentration,
pH, and solvent properties. Structural studies have shown that in vitro, Aβ ﬁbril formation

is preceded by formation of intermediates, spherical oligomeric states and protoﬁbrils (Walsh

et al., 1997; Hartley et al., 1999; Walsh et al., 1999; Kirkitadze et al., 2001; Yong et al.,

2002). Structural studies on oligomeric states are in a less advanced stage compared to those

in ﬁbrils. The nature and structure of diﬀerent oligomeric states may depend crucially on

the speciﬁc amino acid sequence of the peptide (Nilsberth et al., 2001). The Aβ plaques

2

in AD brain are predominantly comprised of two Aβ alloforms, Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42).

Despite the relatively small structural diﬀerence between these two alloforms, they display

distinct behavior, with Aβ(1–42) being a predominant component of parenchymal plaques

(Suzuki et al., 1994; Iwatsubo et al., 1994; Gravina et al., 1995), associated with both early

onset AD (Scheuner et al., 1996; Golde et al., 2000) and increased risk for AD (Weggen et

al., 2001). The cause of the clinical diﬀerences between the two alloforms is still unknown.
Recent experiments have shown that in vitro Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) oligomerize through

distinct pathways with Aβ(1–42) forming spherical paranuclei which further assemble into

higher order oligomers (Bitan et al., 2001; Bitan et al., 2003a; Bitan et al., 2003b).

Several studies found stable soluble Aβ low molecular weight oligomers (Barrow and

Zagorski, 1991; Barrow et al., 1992; Zagorski and Barrow, 1992; Soreghan et al., 1994; Shen

and Murphy, 1995; Podlisny et al., 1995; Roher et al., 1996; Kuo et al., 1996; Garzon-

Rodriguez et al., 1997; Xia et al., 1995; Enya et al., 1999; Funato et al., 1999; Huang et

al., 2000). Low molecular weight oligomers were found in culture media of Chinese hamster

ovary cells expressing endogenous or mutated genes (Podlisny et al., 1995; Xia et al., 1995).

Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) oligomers, speciﬁcally dimers, were isolated from human control

and AD brains (Kuo et al., 1996; Kuo et al., 1998; Enya et al., 1999; Funato et al., 1999).

Dimers and trimers of Aβ were isolated from neuritic and vascular amyloid deposits and

dimers were shown to be toxic to neurons in the presence of microglia (Roher et al., 1996).

Experiments on synthetic Aβ peptides (Garzon-Rodriguez et al., 1997; Podlisny et al., 1998)

showed that soluble Aβ(1–40) exists as a stable dimer at physiological concentrations which

are well below the critical micelle concentration (Soreghan et al., 1994).

It has been shown that the β-sheet content of Aβ depends strongly upon the solvent

in which the peptide is dissolved (Shen and Murphy, 1995). Various experimental studies

(Barrow and Zagorski, 1991; Barrow et al., 1992; Zagorski and Barrow, 1992; Shen and

Murphy, 1995) indicate that soluble Aβ has substantial β-sheet content. Huang et al.

(Huang et al., 2000) reported on two types of soluble oligomers of Aβ(1-40) which were

trapped and stabilized for an extended period of time: the ﬁrst type was a mixture of dimers

and tetramers with irregular secondary structure and the second type corresponded to larger

spherical particles with β-strand structure. Despite some discrepancies in the experimental

results, the studies mentioned above suggest that dimerization may be the initial event in

amyloid aggregation and thus dimers may be fundamental building blocks for further ﬁbril

3

assembly.

Experimental methods, such as circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance and elec-

tron microscopy, provide only limited information on the structure of intermediate oligomeric

states. Therefore, there is a motivation to develop new computational approaches to deter-

mine the exact conformation of oligomers at the atomic level and track the exact pathway

from individual monomer peptides to oligomers and protoﬁbrils in fast and eﬃcient ways.

With the dramatic increase of computer power in recent decades, it has become possible

to study the behavior of large biological molecular systems by Monte Carlo and molecular

dynamics (MD) simulations (Dinner et al., 2002; Fersht and Daggett, 2002; Karplus and

McCammon, 2002; Thirumalai et al., 2002; Plotkin and Onuchic, 2002; Mendes et al., 2002;

Mirny and Shakhnovich, 2001; Bonneau and Baker, 2001; Dill, 1999; Levitt et al., 1997;

Wolynes et al., 1996; Snow et al., 2002; Vorobjev and Hermans, 2001; Zhou and Karplus,

1997). However, traditional all-atom MD with realistic force ﬁelds in a physiological solu-

tion currently remains computationally unfeasible. An aggregation process as allowed by
all-atom MD can only be studied on time scales of up to 10−7s using such advanced technolo-

gies as worldwide distributed computing (Snow et al., 2002; Zagrovic et al., 2002). However,
in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that the initial stages of oligomerization occur on a time

scale of one second (Bitan et al., 2003a), while further aggregation into protoﬁbrillar and

ﬁbrillar aggregates may span hours (Kayed et al., 2003).

Here we conduct a two–step study of Aβ dimer conformations and their stability using a

computationally eﬃcient algorithm combined with a coarse–grained peptide model for Aβ.

We apply a four–bead model for Aβ peptide to study monomer and dimer conformations of

Aβ(1–42) peptide (Ding et al., 2003). We use fast and eﬃcient discrete molecular dynamics

(DMD) simulations (Dokholyan et al., 1998; Smith and Hall, 2001a). The DMD method

allows us to ﬁnd and study a large variety of dimer conformations starting from initially

separated monomers without secondary structures. Our coarse–grained model combined

with the DMD method predicts 10 diﬀerent planar β-strand dimer conformations. In the

second step, we estimate the free energy of Aβ(1–42) and Aβ(1–40) dimeric conformations

in a stability study using all-atom MD simulations with explicit water and well-established

force ﬁelds. This second step enables us to estimate the free energy of diﬀerent dimeric

conformations and to compare the free energies of Aβ(1–42) and Aβ(1–40) for each of the

dimer peptides. Our results suggest that Aβ oligomerization is not accompanied by the

4

formation of stable planar β-strand Aβ dimers, and that such dimers of both Aβ(1-42) and

Aβ(1-40) are equally unlikely to represent stable oligomeric forms.

II. METHODS

A. Discrete molecular dynamics simulations

In a DMD simulation, pairs of particles interact by means of spherically-symmetric po-

tentials that consist of one or more square wells. Within each well the potential is constant.

Consequently, each pair of particles moves with constant velocity until they reach a distance

at which the potential changes. At this moment a collision occurs and the two particles

change their velocities instantaneously while conserving the total energy, momentum, and

angular momentum. There are three main types of collisions. The simplest is when particles

collide at their hard–core distance, the sum of the particle radii. In this case, the particles

collide elastically, and their kinetic energy before and after the collision is conserved. In the

second case, the particles enter a potential well of depth ∆U. In this case, their total kinetic

energy after the collision increases by ∆U, their velocities increase, and there is a change in

their trajectories. In the third case, particles exit a potential well of depth ∆U. Here, total

kinetic energy after the collision decreases by ∆U. If the total kinetic energy of the particles

is greater than ∆U, they escape the well. If their total kinetic energy is smaller than ∆U,

the particles can not escape and simply recoil from the outer border of the well inwards. At

low temperatures, which correspond to low average particle kinetic energies, particles whose

potentials are attractive thus have a tendency to remain associated with each other.

DMD, unlike traditional continuous MD, is event-driven and as such it requires keeping

track of particle positions and velocities only at collision times, which have to be sorted and

updated. It can be shown that the speed of the most eﬃcient DMD algorithm is proportional

to N ln N, where N is the total number of atoms (Rapaport, 1997). In addition, the speed

of the algorithm decreases linearly with the number of discontinuities in the potential and

particle density. In our DMD simulations the solvent is not explicitly present, which reduces

the number of particles in the system. Consequently, the DMD method is several orders

of magnitude faster than the traditional continuous MD. The DMD simulation method

has been so far successfully applied to simulate protein folding (Zhou and Karplus, 1997;

5

Dokholyan et al., 1998; Ding et al., 2002a; Borreguero et al., 2002) and aggregation (Smith

and Hall, 2001a; Smith and Hall, 2001b; Ding et al., 2002b; Ding et al., 2003). In simulating

protein folding and aggregation, coarse–grained models of proteins have been introduced.

In a coarse–grain model the number of atoms per amino acid is reduced to one, two or

four, which further speeds up the DMD simulation. While traditional continuous all-atom

MD can simulate events on time scales of nanoseconds, the DMD method combined with a

coarse–grained protein model can easily reach time scales of seconds or more, which is long

enough to study oligomer formation of up to 100 Aβ peptides.

B. A coarse–grained model for Aβ peptide

The Aβ peptide is derived from its larger amyloid precursor protein by sequential pro-

teolytic cleavages. In amyloid plaques, the two most common forms of the Aβ peptide are

Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42). The amino acid sequence of Aβ(1–42) is

DAEF RHDSGY EV HHQKLV F F AEDV GSNKGAIIGLMV GGV V IA.

The amino acid sequence of Aβ(1–40) is the same as that of Aβ(1–42), but shorter by two

amino acids at the C-terminus, Ile and Ala (IA in the above sequence).

In our DMD simulations we apply the simplest version of the four–bead model (Takada

et al., 1999; Smith and Hall, 2001a; Smith and Hall, 2001b; Ding et al., 2003) for Aβ

peptide. In this model, each amino acid in the peptide is replaced by at most four “beads”.

These beads correspond to the atoms comprising the amide nitrogen N, the alpha carbon
Cα and prime-carbon C ′. The fourth bead, representing the amino acid side-chain atoms,

is placed at the center of the nominal Cβ atom. Due to their lack of side-chains, the six

glycines in Aβ (positions 9, 25, 29, 33, 37 and 38) are represented by only three beads.

Two beads that form a permanent bond can assume any distance between the minimum

and maximum bond length. In addition to permanent bonds between the beads, the model

introduces constraints between pairs of beads which do not form permanent bonds. These

constraints are implemented in order to account for the correct peptide backbone geometry.

The hard–core radii, minimum and maximum bond lengths, constraints’ lengths and their

corresponding standard deviations are either calculated from distributions of experimental

distances between pairs of these groups found in about 7700 folded proteins with known

6

crystal structures (Protein Data Bank), or chosen following the standard knowledge of the

geometry of the peptide backbone (Creighton, 1993). The values of all these parameters

have been reported previously (Ding et al., 2003).

To account for the hydrogen bonding that normally occurs in proteins between the car-

bonyl oxygen of one amino acid and the amide hydrogen of another amino acid, the coarse–

grained model implements a bond between the nitrogen of the i − th amino acid, Ni, and the
carbon of the j − th amino acid, C ′

j, as introduced previously (Ding et al., 2003). The planar

geometry of the hydrogen bond is modeled by introducing auxiliary bonds between the left
and the right neighboring beads of Ni and C ′

j. The hydrogen bond between Ni and C ′

j will

form only if all six beads are at energetically favorable distances. Once the hydrogen bond is

formed, it can break due to thermal ﬂuctuations, which can cause energetically unfavorable

distances among the six beads involved in the hydrogen bond. When amino acids i and j

belong to the same peptide, they can form a hydrogen bond only if at least three amino acids
exist between them (to satisfy the 180◦ NH-CO bond angle). A more detailed description

of the hydrogen bond implementation has been given elsewhere (Ding et al., 2003). Our

current implementation diﬀers slightly from before (Ding et al., 2003): one of the auxiliary

bonds, namely the auxiliary bond between Ni and the bead N (the nearest neighbor of
C ′
instead of 5.10 ± 0.31˚A used previously (Ding et
al., 2003), it is 4.70 ± 0.08˚A. This slight change in the auxiliary bond length stabilizes the

j) has a shorter equilibrium distance:

β-hairpin monomer conformation in our model as described in the results section.

C. All-atom molecular dynamics in an explicit solvent

Next we detail how we use all-atom MD simulations in an explicit solvent to compute the

conformational free energy of Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) monomer and dimer conformations.

1. Preparation of peptide conformations

For Aβ(1–40) monomer peptide structures we use ten NMR structures with coordinates

(Coles et al., 1998) (ID code name 1BA4 of Protein Database Bank). For each of these ten

Aβ(1–40) monomer structures, we construct a corresponding Aβ(1–42) monomer structure

by adding two residues, Ile and Ala, to the C-terminus of the peptide using the SYBYL

7

(Tripos Inc.) molecular modeling package.

All Aβ(1-42) dimer conformations in this study are generated by DMD simulations using

the four–bead model as described above. Dimer conformations, initially in the four–bead

representation, are converted into all–atom representation by using all–atom template amino

acids. These templates are superposed onto the coarse–grained amino acids such that the
four beads of the coarse–grained model coincide with the N, Cα, C ′ and Cβ groups of the

all–atom template amino acids. The new template coordinates with increased number of

degrees of freedom are optimized for preserving backbone distances as well as formation of

peptide planes. This optimization is performed by rotating the template amino acid along
two axes, the Cα–N and the C ′–Cα axes using a Monte Carlo algorithm. After positioning

the backbone atoms, the positions of side–chain atoms are determined by avoiding steric

collisions with the backbone and other neighboring residues. Positioning of side–chain atoms

also follows a Monte Carlo algorithm, during which side–chain atoms are rotated sequentially

along the Cα–Cβ axis and the Cβ–Cγ axis in order to ﬁnd the optimal combination of axes

angles that prevent collisions. The backbone structure of the resulting peptide remains very

close to the initial structure of the peptide: the lengths of bonds and constraints after the

conversion are within the limits given by our coarse–grained model. The Aβ(1-40) dimer

conformations corresponding to each Aβ(1-42) dimer are constructed by disposing of the

last two amino acids of each Aβ(1-42) dimer conformation.

2. Calculation of the conformational free energy in water

We estimate conformational free energies of monomers and dimers in a water environment

using all–atom MD simulations. All MD calculations are performed using the Sigma MD

program (Hermans et al., 1994) with CEDAR force ﬁelds (Ferro et al., 1980; Hermans et

al., 1984). We complete the all–atom reconstruction from above by adding hydrogen atoms

and solvating the peptide(s) in a SPC water model bath (Berendsen et al., 1981). We use
periodic boundary conditions on a cubic box whose sides extended 12˚A beyond the leading

edge of the peptide(s) on all sides. The MD method consists of two stages, equilibration and

production (Vorobjev et al., 1998; Vorobjev and Hermans, 1999; Vorobjev and Hermans,

2001; Leach, 2001). Equilibration allows both the peptides and water to relax to a local

energy minimum. The steps of equilibration, (1)-(7), and the production (8) are as follows:

8

(1) minimize the energy of the water—peptides are kept immobile;

(2) perform MD simulations on the water using the NVT ensemble at a temperature T =

200K for 96ps (the time step is 1f s)—peptides are kept immobile;

(3) minimize the energy of the water a second time—peptides are kept immobile;

(4) minimize the energy of the peptides—water molecules are kept immobile;

(5) perform MD simulations of the peptide using the NVT ensemble at a temperature

(T = 100K)—water molecules are kept immobile;

(6) minimize the energy of the peptides a second time—water molecules are kept immobile;

(7) minimize the energy of the peptides and water molecules simultaneously;

(8) perform the production run, i.e., unconstrained MD simulations on the peptides and

water using the NPT ensemble at T = 300K and P = 1atm for 196ps.

At steps (1), (3), (4), (6) and (7) we use the steepest descent energy minimization method.

During steps (2) and (5), which are parts of equilibration, peptide(s) and water coordinates

have to reach a local energy minimum for the given force ﬁeld and with respect to each

other. The temperatures are kept low so that there are no conformational changes.

During the production run (8) we maintain constant temperature and pressure by Berend-

sen coupling (Berendsen et al., 1984) and calculate electrostatic forces using the particle–

mesh Ewald procedure (Darden et al., 1993). We record a snapshot of the conﬁguration

every picosecond. We calculate the free energy for each conformation by averaging the in-

stantaneous free energy for each of the 196 snapshots. Each of these snapshots represent

a microconﬁguration. We calculate the free energy for each conﬁguration by the ES/IS

method (Vorobjev and Hermans, 1999), which uses an explicit solvent simulation with an

implicit solvent continuum model:

GA = hUm(x)iA + hW (x)iA − T Sconf,A,

(1)

where h...iA denotes an average over all recorded microconﬁgurations of the conformation

A, Um is the intra–protein conformational energy, and Sconf,A is the entropy of conformation

9

A. The intra–protein conformational energy, Um, is a sum of two terms: one is the short–

range energy of packing, Um,pack, and the other is the electrostatic energy due to coulombic

interactions, Um,coul. The solvation free energy, W (x), is the sum of three terms: the ﬁrst

one, Gcav, is the energy required to form a cavity in the solvent; the second one, Gs,vdw,

is a contribution of the van der Waals interactions between solvent and protein; and the

third one, Gpol, is a contribution of the electrostatic polarization of the solvent and polar

components of the solute. Thus the above equation becomes

GA = hUm,packiA + hUm,couliA + hGcaviA + hGs,vdwiA + hGpoliA − T Sconf,A .

(2)

We determine Um and Gs,vdw from the MD trajectory, calculate Gcav as proportional to the

accessible surface area for a given micro-conﬁguration, and evaluate Gpol using an implicit

model for the solvent (in our case water) as described elsewhere (Vorobjev and Hermans,

1999).

III. RESULTS

A. Characterization of monomer conformations

The secondary structure of both Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) monomer peptides, as deter-

mined by NMR conformational studies in an apolar environment that mimics the lipid phase

of membranes, is predominantly α-helical. Two α-helical regions exist at residues 8-25 and

28-38, and these regions are separated by a ﬂexible hinge. The rest of the peptide adopts

random coil-like conformation (Coles et al., 1998; Crescenzi et al., 2002).

In order to characterize the monomer conformations in our coarse–grained model, we

calculate an average potential energy in dependence on the temperature. The energy unit

corresponds to the potential energy of one hydrogen bond in our model, so that the absolute

average of the potential energy is equal to the average number of hydrogen bonds in the

monomer conformation, and the temperature unit is equal to the energy unit. At each

temperature T , 0.080 < T < 0.155, we perform 35 × 106 time steps long simulation runs.

We start each run with an initial conformation equal to the observed NMR conformation

with predominantly α-helical secondary structure (Crescenzi et al., 2002). The ﬁrst 15 × 106

steps we allow for equilibration, whereas we calculate the time average of the potential

energy hEi over the last 20 × 106 time steps.

10

Our monomer peptide experiences a structural transition from a predominantly α-helix

conformation into a β-strand conformation at Tα,β = 0.107 ± 0.002, in agreement with

previous work (Ding et al., 2003). At a higher temperature, Tβ,RC = 0.128 ± 0.002, the

monomer undergoes a transition from a β-strand into a random coil conformation with no

particular secondary structure. Between Tα,β and Tβ,RC our simulations show various types

of β-strand rich conformations.

At temperatures T , T < 0.107, we observe an α-helix conformation which is consistent

with the observed solution monomer conformation in an apolar microenvironment (Crescenzi

et al., 2002). This conformation (Fig. 1a) has a random coil-like tail about 10 amino acids

long at the N-terminus and another random coil-like tail about 2-4 amino acids long at the

C-terminus. At residues 11-40 there are two α helices, separated by a hinge at residues 25-

28. The average potential energy of this conformation is hEi = −28 ± 2. At temperatures

0.107 < T < 0.117, we observe various β-strand conformations, mostly with two or three β-

turns, corresponding to 3 or 4 β-strands (Figs. 1b-c). The average potential energy of these

conformations is hEi = −17±1. The β-hairpin conformation, i.e. a 2-β-strand conformation

with one β-turn, shown in Fig. 1d, is found as a predominant conformation at temperatures

T , 0.117 < T < 0.126. This conformation is characterized by a random coil tail at residues

1-9 and by a well deﬁned and localized β-turn which is positioned at residues 23-28. The

average potential energy of this conformation is hEi = −13 ± 1.

The observed β-turn between residues Asp 23 and Lys 28 is in agreement with recent

NMR studies of Aβ ﬁbrillar structure (Petkova et al., 2002). In the following, we provide

an empirical explanation for the occurrence of this well–deﬁned β-turn in our model. We

hypothesize that within our model the occurrence of a β-turn at resides 23-28 is induced

by the particular location of the six glycines in the Aβ(1-42) peptide. In order to test this

hypothesis, we replace all glycines within the Aβ(1-42) peptide with alanines and perform

simulation runs as described above. Our results (Fig. 2) show the probability for the amino

acid at a certain position to be part of a β-turn both for the original Aβ peptide model

(with glycines) and the one without glycines (42 amino acids long polyalanine chain). The

results show that (i) the presence of glycines on average shifts the center of the β-turn from

residue 20-22 for the chain with no glycines to 25-27 for the chain with six glycines, and (ii)

the probability distribution in the presence of glycines is strongly peaked at residues 25-27,

which makes these three residues part of the β-turn with more than 95% probability and

11

thus β-turn is well–deﬁned.

The residues 25-27 of the Aβ peptide correspond to glycine, serine and asparagine, the

residues which have according to the classical phenomenological approach of Chou and

Fasman (Chou and Fasman, 1974) the highest probability to be within a β-turn. In our

coarse–grained model the occurrence of the β-turn at 23-28 can be understood as a conse-

quence of two tendencies: (1) a tendency to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds, which

prefers a β-turn at the middle of the peptide chain, centered at resides 20-22; and (2) a

tendency of 6 glycines to be associated with more ﬂexibility, thus a β-turn. Consequently,

the center of the β-turn is shifted from residues 20-22 to residues 25-27, and is well-deﬁned.

B. Planar β-strand dimer conformations of Aβ(1–42)

We investigate next dimer formation of Aβ(1–42) peptides. The initial monomer confor-

mations are taken from the Protein Database Bank and correspond to the observed NMR

structures of Aβ(1-42) monomers in an apolar environment (Crescenzi et al., 2002). In order

to obtain diﬀerent starting random coil conformations, we place two monomers with mostly
α-helical secondary structure in a cubic box with a side length of 100˚A. The centers of
masses of the two monomers are initially about 50˚A apart and their orientations parallel.

Next, we heat the system up to a temperature T = 0.50, which is far above the observed

Tβ,RC temperature. The α-helical secondary structure of individual monomer peptides is

dissolved in about 200 simulations steps, producing two peptides with diﬀerent random coil

conformations. We use many similarly generated pairs of peptides with random coil confor-

mations as initial conﬁgurations in our study of dimer formation. Dimer formation runs are

done at a constant temperature and volume. We perform 20 runs at a ﬁxed temperature.

Each run is 20 × 106 time steps long. In this way we explore temperatures T = 0.120, 0.125

and 0.130.

From the above simulations we ﬁnd six possible dimer conformations with the following

characteristics: (i) each peptide in a dimer is in a β-hairpin conformation with two β-strands

and (ii) all four β-strands (two per peptide) are planar. We name those dimers according

to the inner two strands of the dimer (each strand is either closer to the N-terminus or the

C-terminus and the two inner strands are either parallel or antiparallel): NN-parallel, NC-

parallel, CC-parallel, NN-antiparallel, NC-antiparallel, CC-antiparallel. These conforma-

12

tions are schematically presented in Fig. 3a-f. We ﬁnd four additional dimer conformations

with the characteristic (ii) described above. Only the inner peptide has also the character-

istic (i), while the outer peptide is bent around the inner one, forming a “nest”. We term

them nested parallel, nested antiparallel, anti-nested parallel and anti-nested antiparallel (in

anti-nested conformations the termini of the two peptides are in the opposite directions).

They are shown in Fig. 3g-j.

At T = 0.12, we ﬁnd NC-parallel and NC-antiparallel conformations each in 3 out of

20 runs. The conformations NN-parallel, CC-parallel, CC-antiparallel, nested antiparallel,

anti-nested parallel and anti-nested antiparallel, each occur in 2 out of 20 runs. The con-

formations NN- antiparallel and nested parallel each are found in 1 out of 20 runs. At

T = 0.13, the most common dimer peptide conformation is NC-parallel (occurring in 8 out

of 20 runs) and the next most common conformation is NN-parallel (occurring in 5 out of 20

runs). We ﬁnd the NC-antiparallel conformation in 3 out of 20 runs. There are four more

conformations found, each in 1 out of 20 runs: NN-antiparallel, CC-parallel, CC-antiparallel

and a nested-antiparallel conformation.

Our dimer simulation runs at temperatures T ≥ 0.14 show no dimerization within the

ﬁrst 20 × 106 simulation steps, even though typically one of the two peptides adopts one

of the β-strand conformations. We thus conclude that at temperatures T > 0.14 there is

no dimerization. At temperature T = 0.11, we observe a large number of diﬀerent planar

and non–planar β-strand dimer conformations, which are a mixture of 2-, 3-, 4-β-strand

conformations. At temperatures 0.08 < T < 0.11, the dimer conformations are an amor-

phous mixture of β-strand and α-helical secondary structure. All these are omitted from

the present all-atom free energy calculation study.

C. Free energy calculations: Aβ(1-40) versus Aβ(1-42) monomer conformations.

In order to validate the free energy calculation method, we ﬁrst analyze monomer peptides

of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42). We choose 10 diﬀerent NMR Aβ(1-40) monomer structures

(Coles et al., 1998). The secondary monomer structure is mostly α-helical, similar to Fig. 1a.

To each of these structures we add 2 amino acids, Ile and Ala, to ﬁnd the corresponding

Aβ(1-42) monomer conformation. The estimate free energies are presented in Table I and

show that all the monomer conformations, of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42), have on average the

13

same conformational free energy, −1034.68 ± 17.75kcal/mol and −1029.47 ± 10.80kcal/mol,

respectively. These results show that addition of two amino acids to the C-terminus does

not alter the conformational free energy in a water environment at physiological conditions.

D. Stability analysis of Aβ(1-40) and (1-42) dimer conformations.

The planar β-strand dimer conformations predicted by our coarse–grained model (Fig. 3)

are tested for stability in our all–atom MD simulations in an explicit water environment

at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. From ten diﬀerent Aβ(1-42) dimer con-

formations, we create the corresponding Aβ(1-40) dimers by deleting the last two amino

acids at the C-terminus. For each stable dimer conﬁguration we then calculate the free

energy as described in the Methods section. The free energies of all the stable dimers are

presented in Table II. One dimer conformation, e.g. nested antiparallel of Aβ(1-40), is de-

termined to be only marginally stable and does not allow for the free energy calculation.

Columns 3 and 6 of Table II represent the free energy diﬀerences, ∆GAβ−40 and ∆GAβ−42,

between a dimer conformation and two monomer conformations. For all stable dimer con-

formations ∆G is positive, indicating that in a water environment, planar β-strand dimer

conformations are energetically unfavorable compared to α-helical monomer peptide con-

formations. The average conformational free energies of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) dimers are

−2000.81 ± 46.94kcal/mol and −1967.63 ± 52.85kcal/mol, respectively. Although Aβ(1-

40) dimers have on average lower conformational free energies than Aβ(1-42) dimers, the

diﬀerence is not statistically signiﬁcant.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We introduce a coarse–grained peptide model for the Aβ peptide in order to study Aβ

dimer formation. Our model predicts a thermally–induced conformational change between

a predominantly α-helix to a predominantly β-strand monomer peptide. The prediction

of our model is indirectly supported by recent experiments (Gursky and Aleshkov, 2000)

on temperature–dependence of the Aβ conformation in aqueous solutions, which show that

thermally induced coil to β-strand transition is not coupled to aggregation and can occur

at the level of monomers or dimers. In a temperature range below the structural transition

14

into a random coil our model Aβ monomer peptide adopts a β-hairpin conformation with

a β-turn between Asp 23 and Lys 28. The presence of this β-turn is consistent with a

structural model for Aβ ﬁbrils based on solid state NMR experimental constraints (Petkova

et al., 2002).

Within our coarse–grained model we study Aβ dimer formation, which may be a pathway

to higher oligomer and protoﬁbril formation.

In our model Aβ dimers are formed as a

consequence of hydrogen-bond interactions between residues. Our model predicts that dimer

conformations are β-sheet-like planar structures. We show by using all-atom simulations

that these planar, β-sheet-like dimer conformations are energetically unfavorable compared

to the α-helical monomer conformations in water environment. Moreover, the free energy

comparison of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) dimer conformations shows that there is no signiﬁcant

free energy diﬀerence between these two alloforms, thus suggesting that Aβ oligomerization

is not accompanied by the formation of stable planar β-strand Aβ dimers.

Planar β-strand Aβ dimers as predicted by our coarse–grained model cannot account

for experimentally observed diﬀerences in Aβ oligomer formation between Aβ(1-40) and

Aβ(1-42) alloforms (Bitan et al., 2003a). It is not understood yet at which stage of oligomer

formation those diﬀerences occur and what is the exact mechanism which drives the two

alloforms along diﬀerent pathways. In order to account for oligomer formation diﬀerences

between the two Aβ alloforms, our coarse–grained model may need to include other inter-

actions between the residues, in particular the ones that originate in polar versus apolar

character of the side–chains as suggested by recent experiments (Bitan et al., 2003c; Bitan

et al., 2003b).

FIGURE LEGENDS

Fig. 1: Conformations of an Aβ(1–42) monomer peptide model as a function of tempera-

ture, (a) mostly α-helix conformation at T = 0.100 with two α helices at residues 12-23

and 29-38, and a hinge at residues 23-28; (b) 3-β-strand conformation at T = 0.108, (c)

4-β-strand conformation at T = 0.115, and (d) β-hairpin conformation at T = 0.120

characterized by a β-turn at residues 23-28.

Fig. 2: Two distributions that give the probability for an amino acid at a residue number

(position in the chain) to be within a β-turn. These simulations are done at tempera-

ture T = 0.125, where our model for Aβ(1-42) yields a stable β-hairpin conformation.

The curve with open circles corresponds to the altered chain (no glycines) and the

curve with triangles corresponds to the original Aβ(1-42) model with six glycines.

The distributions are calculated on the basis of 28 (the model with no glycines) and

38 (the Aβ(1-42) model) diﬀerent β-hairpin conﬁgurations. For each β-hairpin confor-

mation we use VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996) visualization package to determine and

count all the residues with a β-turn. The probability to be in the β-turn is determined

as a ratio between the number of conformations, in which the amino acid is part of a

β-turn, and the total number of conformations.

FIG. 3: Schematic conformations of an Aβ(1–42) dimer peptide model. All the conforma-

tions are based on a β-hairpin conformation with a β-turn at residues 23-28. In our

model the energies of all these conformations are approximately the same, however,

the probability of the occurrence varies.

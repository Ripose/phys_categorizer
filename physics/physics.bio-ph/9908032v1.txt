Current-day genomes bear the mark of the evolutionary processes. One of the strongest indica-
tions is the sequence homology among families of proteins that perform similar biological functions
in diﬀerent species. The number of proteins in a family can grow over time as genetic information is
duplicated through evolution. We explore how evolution directs the size distribution of these fami-
lies. Theoretical predictions for family sizes are obtained from two models, one in which individual
genes duplicate and a second in which the entire genome duplicates. Predictions from these mod-
els are compared with the family size distributions for several organisms whose complete genome
sequence is known. We ﬁnd that protein family size distributions in nature follow a power-law
distribution. Comparing these results to the model systems, we conclude that genome duplication
is the dominant mechanism leading to increased genetic material in the species considered.

I. INTRODUCTION

Current-day genomes are the result of generations of
evolution. One of the marks of evolution is the exis-
tence of protein families. These families comprise groups
of proteins that share sequence similarity and perform
similar biological functions [1,2]. The most likely expla-
nation for the similarity in sequence and function is that
all the proteins in a family evolved from a single common
ancestor.

The size of a family, deﬁned here as the number of
proteins in a family for a particular species, evolves over
time through processes that increase the physical size of
an organism’s genome. Genomes in many major lineages
are thought to have undergone ancient doublings one or
more times [3]. It is thought that genome doubling can
provide an evolutionary advantage by permitting redun-
dant genes to evolve rapidly and perform diﬀerent biolog-
ical roles, potentially allowing entire pathways to acquire
more speciﬁc function [4].

At ﬁner scales, chromosomal regions or individual
genes may be may be duplicated or lost through evolu-
tion. Even without physical loss, protein coding regions
may suﬀer loss of function and cease to be expressed,
leading to the existence of pseudogenes [5].

Previous studies have detected patterns supporting
growth and loss of genetic information. Evolutionary
processes consisting of duplication and mutation can
introduce long-range, power-law correlations in the se-
quences of individual genes [6]; reports of such correla-
tions in intron-rich regions sparked considerable interest
[7].

In contrast to studies of individual gene sequences, we
developed a model to explain the evolution of the physi-
cal size of a genome [8]. In our model, a speciation rate
allowed genome size to increase or decrease, and an ex-
tinction rate removed individual species. The ratio of
the speciation and extinction rates yielded scaling laws
for the distribution of genome sizes: exponential scaling
when the amount of genetic material lost or gained was
constant, and power-law scaling leading to a self-similar
distribution when the change in genetic material was pro-
portional to the existing size. Closed-form approxima-
tions agreed with simulation results and explained obser-
vations reported by others [9].

Here we use related models to explore size of gene fam-
ilies. Processes that add and remove genetic material are
presented in Sec. II. In the ﬁrst model, we assume that
duplication occurs on the level of individual genes.
In
the second model, we assume that these events dupli-
cate an entire genome. Closed-form solutions are pro-
vided for the size distributions of gene families. Next, in
Sec. III, we present results from analysis of gene fam-

3

ilies in sequenced genomes. These results rely heavily
on the clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) database,
which identiﬁes gene families that span eight individual
unicellular species including eubacteria, archaebacteria,
cyanobacteria, and eukaryots [1]. We discuss which evo-
lutionary model is most consistent with our observations
in Sec. IV.

II. THEORY

For a single organism, let Pn be the number of gene
families that contain n genes. The total number of fam-
ilies is sumnPn = Ptot. We describe two models for the
increase or decrease of the number of genes in the family.

A. Model I: Gene Duplication

In Model I, we assume that each gene in the family
evolves independently. Each gene duplicates with rate k+
and each gene is lost with rate k−. With each generation,
the change in the number of families of size n is

∆Pn = (n − 1)k+Pn−1 + (n + 1)k−Pn+1 − n(k− + k+)Pn.

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

After suﬃcient time, the distribution reaches equilibrium
values. Detailed balance indicates that the number of
families increasing from size n to n + 1 should equal the
number of families decreasing from size n + 1 to size n,

nk+Pn = (n + 1)k−Pn+1.

The resulting expression for the populations is

Pn/Ptot = (1/n)αn/[−ln(1 − α)],

where we have deﬁned α as k+/k−. Alternatively, nor-
malizing by the families with a single member, we have

Pn/P1 = (1/n)αn−1.

In addition to describing dynamics when each gene
is duplicated individually, this model can also represent
a system in which large genomic regions are duplicated
or lost, provided that only one member of the family is
present in the duplicated region. If, for example, a single
chromosome is duplicated, this model could apply.

The populations Pn/P1 predicted by Model I are shown
as black lines in Fig. 1 for three choices of the parame-
ter α: 0.1 (thin black line), 0.3 (medium black line), and
0.9 (thick black line). As the value of α increases, the
distribution of families shifts to larger sizes. The shape

4

of the distribution changes from a straight line on the
log-log plot at small n, characteristic of a power-law dis-
tribution, to a curved line at larger n, characterstic of
the faster decay of an exponential distribution.

B. Model II: Genome Duplication

In Model II, we assume that genome duplication domi-
nates the evolutionary process. Each genome can double
in size with probability k+ or be reduced by half with
probability k−. Writing the size of a family after j dou-
blings as n = 2j, the evolution of j at each generation
is

∆Pj = k+Pj−1 + k−Pj+1 − (k+ + k−)Pj .

(5)

Again relying on detailed balance, we ﬁnd that Pj ∼ αj,
with α = k+/k− as before. For normalization, we assume
that

j Pj = Ptot, yielding

P

Pj = (1 − α)αj .

(6)

To change variables from j to n, we make an approx-
imation that the discrete values of j and n may be re-
placed by a continuous distribution. The distribution for
n is then Pn = Pj(n)dj(n)/dn, where j(n) = log2(n),
giving

Pn/Ptot = [(1 − α)/ ln 2]n(ln α/ ln 2)−1.

(7)

Because we used a continuous distribution to derive this
result, the normalization is not exact. The power-law
form of the distribution, however, is accurate, and sim-
ple summation may be used to deﬁne the normalization
constant.

Alternatively, the distribution may be deﬁned relative

to the number of families of size 1, or

Pn/P1 = n(ln α/ ln 2)−1.

(8)

Results for Pn/P1 are shown as grey lines in Fig. 1 for
three values of α: 0.1 (thin grey line), 0.3 (medium grey
line), and 0.9 (thick grey line). As these are power-law
distributions, they are straight on a log-log plot. The
distribution favors larger family sizes as α increases.

III. RESULTS

To investigate the size distributions of gene fami-
lies in nature, we analyzed the contents of the COG
database [1]. This database uses essentially unsupervised
sequence-similarity comparisons to group proteins into

5

families of orthologs and paralogs. The current release
includes 8328 proteins from eight sequenced genomes (E.
coli, H. inﬂuenzae, H. pylori, M. genitalium, M. pneu-
moniaa, Synechocystis, M. jannaschii, and S. cerevisiae)
and assigns them to 864 individual families. Only pro-
teins with orthologs in at least three species are included
in the database . Using this database, we computed the
number of families of size n, Pn, for each species, then
normalized the result by P1 for the same species. The
results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 2.

As seen in Fig. 2, all the species show power-law be-
havior for Pn/P1 as a function of n for families of size 10
or smaller. The linear trend indicates that Model II, du-
plication of the entire genome, is more likely than Model
I, in which individual genes are duplicated.

We explore the linear trend more quantitatively by per-
forming a least-squares ﬁt of the data for each model.
The quantity we minimize is the RMS error for the log-
transformed data,

RMS =

(1/N )

[log10(Pn/P1)data − log10(Pn/P1)ﬁt]2,

s

Xn:Pn≥2

(9)

with (Pn/P1)ﬁt from Eq. 4 or Eq. 8. As noted in the
summation, we considered only family sizes n with Pn =
2 or more; the total number of family sizes used is N . The
results of the ﬁt are detailed in Table I, along with the
number of family sizes that contributed to the ﬁt. The
model with the smaller RMS for the ﬁt is also indicated.
As seen in Table I, Model II (complete genome dupli-
cation) provides a consistently better ﬁt to the data than
does Model I (individual gene duplication). In particular,
when all of the protein families for a given organism are
considered, each of the eight organisms shows a better ﬁt
with Model II than with Model I.

In Table I the ﬁt values for α are also shown for
the functional classes deﬁned in the COG database:
information storage and processing, cellular processes,
metabolism, and poorly characterized [1]. These indi-
vidual classes are also ﬁt better by Model II than by
Model I. In E. coli, H. inﬂuenzae, H. pylori, M. pnuemo-
niae, and Synechocystis, at least three of the four classes
are ﬁt better by Model II; in M. genitalium, there are
not enough protein families for adequate predictions of
α. Only in S. cerevisiae does Model I appear to provide
a slightly better ﬁt to the distribution of family sizes
for two classes, information storage and processing and
cellular processes. One possible explanation for the bet-
ter performance of Model I for S. cerevisiae is that gene
families grow through the duplication of chromosomes,
rather than the duplication of individual genes or en-
tire genomes. The distinction between the genome and

6

individual chromosomes is not applicable to the other
organisms, which have a single chromosome.

A trend evident in Table I is that α for cellular pro-
cesses (molecular chaperones, outer membrane, cell wall
biogenesis, secretion, motility,
inorganic ion transport
and metabolism) is typically larger than α for infor-
mation storage and processing (translation, ribosomal
structure and biogenesis, transcription, replication, re-
pair, recombination) and for metabolism (energy produc-
tion and conversion, carbohydrate metabolism and trans-
port, amino acid metabolism and transport, coenzyme
metabolism, lipid metabolism). Protein families for cel-
lular processes are therefore biased towards larger sizes,
while families for information storage and processing and
metabolism are biased toward smaller family sizes. This
would imply that, in either model, a duplication of cel-
lular process proteins is more likely to be retained than
duplications of other functions. This suggests that cells
can tolerate changes to cellular process pathways more
readily than to other pathways.

The relative performance of Model I and Model II ac-
cording to protein family functional class is summarized
in Table II. When all classes are considered, Model II
clearly provides a better explanation of the observed fam-
ily sizes. When classes are considered separately, Model
II provides a better explanation for three classes (infor-
mation storage and processing, metabolism, and poorly
characterized functions), while Model I provides a better
explanation only for cellular processes.

The ﬁts provided by Model I and Model II are shown
in Fig. 3 for E. coli and S. cerevisiae. The observed fam-
ily size distributions are shown as points and the best ﬁts
as lines, grey for Model I and black for Model II. The top
pair of panels shows the results when all protein families
are considered. For families up to size 10, the distribu-
tions from both organisms clearly follow the power-law
prediction of Model II.

For the separate protein classes, the E. coli family sizes
continue to follow the power-law prediction of Model II.
As mentioned previously for S. cerevisiae, however, the ﬁt
to Model II is not good for the storage and processing and
cellular processes classes. The size distribution decays
much more rapidly than Model II predicts.

IV. DISCUSSION

We have investigated the size distribution of protein
families. For a selection of single-celled organisms with
sequenced genomes, we ﬁnd that the number of fam-
ilies with n members follows a power-law distribution
as a function of n. This behavior suggests that evolu-
tion increases protein diversity through duplication of

7

entire genomes, balanced occasionally by the loss of large
amounts of genetic information. It is less likely that pro-
tein diversity is increased through the duplication of in-
dividual genes, since this process would not lead to a
power-law distribution.

The power-law we ﬁnd is that Pn/P1 n−α, where Pn is
the number of families of size n. The exponent α varies
from 0.2 to 0.6 depending on species. In our theory, this
exponent measures the ratio of the rate of genome dupli-
cation to the rate of gene loss. The behavior we obtain
for all species indicates that the rate of genome duplica-
tion, relative to the rate of gene loss, is approximately the
same for each species. This points to the ancient origin
of the cellular machinery responsible for the duplication
of DNA.

Diﬀerent classes of genes evolve at slightly diﬀerent
rates. Families that perform cellular processes tend to
be larger than average. Supplementing these functions
might provide a disproportionate selective advantage.
Also, the remaining functions (information storage and
processing and metabolism) could represent core cellular
machinery that is relatively standard and requires less
variability.

It would be interesting to verify whether the same pro-
tein family size distributions are observed in multicellu-
lar plants and animals. One might expect that genome
duplication would be supplanted by chromosome duplica-
tion, which would shift the family size distribution from a
power law to a steeper, almost exponential decay. Some
evidence in this direction is already provided with the
S. cerevisiae data presented in Sec. III. With the C. el-
egans sequence reported [10], the D. melanogaster se-
quence promised within a year [11], and a rough draft of
the H. sapiens genome imminent [12], this question might
soon be answered.

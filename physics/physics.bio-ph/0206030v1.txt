Comment on ”Swarming Ring Patterns in Bacte-
rial Colonies Exposed to Ultraviolet Radiation”

In an interesting experiment, Delprato et al. [1] ob-
served pattern formation by colonies of soil bacteria
Bacillus subtilis exposed to ultra violet (UV) radiation
on a 2-dimensional surface. Under spatially uniform UV
radiation exposure (30 W/m2) the population, initially
uniformly distributed over a nutrient rich agar surface,
was observed to move toward the edge of the colony until,
after approximately 45 hours, virtually the entire popu-
lation was concentrated within a few mm of the colony’s
edge, forming a ring. After removal of the UV, the
colony grew normally outward and inward from the ring.
Thus the authors ruled out nutrient depletion near the
colony center as a reason for evacuation [2]. The authors
oﬀer a possible explanation based on a variant of the
usual reaction-diﬀusion dynamics [3], whereby the bacte-
ria, stimulated by the UV, migrate towards the edge of
the colony because of reduced waste concentration there.
We point out here that the formation of a ring pattern
is an artifact of the conﬁnement of the dynamics to two
dimensions. As we show by example below, the only
conditions necessary for the formation of ring patterns is
that the agents must ﬂee UV, move in a 2-dimensional
geometry, and be conﬁned to a circular area.

Bacillus subtilis, a motile bacteria, normally lives and
moves in a 3-dimensional environment. A variety of liv-
ing creatures ﬂee UV for one reason or another and when
conﬁned to two dimensions make ring patterns. One ex-
ample is the well investigated fresh water zooplankton
Daphnia magna. These plankton are a favorite prey of
ﬁsh that hunt visually. For a variety of reasons includ-
ing temperature and food Daphnia stay near the water
surface at night. With the rising of the sun, UV in the
surface layer of the water signals Daphnia to swim fur-
ther down the water column where darkness and mud
concentration shield them from most predatory ﬁsh and
also from harmful UV radiation [4] (this process is com-
monly known as diel vertical migration).

Figure 1(a),(b) shows a Daphnia population, approxi-
mately uniformly distributed in dark, immediately ﬂee-
ing to the bottom of a 3-dimensional medium (15 cm of
water in a 50 × 20 cm aquarium) upon exposure of the
top surface to UV. When conﬁned to an approximately
2-dimensional medium (1 cm of water in a 15 cm diame-
ter Petri dish) and exposed to a uniform intensity of UV
Daphnia immediately ﬂee to the edge of the dish (Fig.
1(c),(d)) thus forming a ring similar to that observed by
Delprato et al. These behaviors are robust in both two
and three dimensions having been observed many times
under various conditions.

In contrast to the reasons oﬀered above by Delprato
et al., we propose that Bacillus subtilis ﬂee UV in order
to avoid the sun drying out the surface layers of soil in
a manner related to the classic motions of the magne-
totactic bacteria, Spirochaeta plicatilis [5] to which they
are similar. Therefore the above given conditions neces-

sary for the formation of ring patterns are satisﬁed in the
experiment of Delprato et al.: The agents ﬂee UV, are
forced to move in a 2-dimensional geometry, and are con-
ﬁned to a circular area given by the shape of the colony
grown before the UV radiation is switched on. Thus
the experimental design of Delprato et al.
is artiﬁcial
as neither bacteria nor Daphnia do naturally live in a 2-
dimensional environment. To investigate the reaction of
Bacillus subtilis to UV radiation coming from above, a
seminal experiment should have a 3-dimensional setup.

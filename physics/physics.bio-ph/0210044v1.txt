Abstract

We present a tentative interpretation of the origin of nematic liquid crystalline
order exhibited by dragline silk ﬁbroin solutions collected from the spider
Nephila clavipes. Liquid crystallinity is thought to confer certain rheological
properties on the ﬁbroin solution which are exploited during the dragline
spinning process. We show that the feasibility of liquid crystallinity under
physiological conditions depends critically on parameters characterising the
amino-acid sequence of the ﬁbroin molecules.

“Dragline” silk secreted by the major ampullate gland of the orb-weaver spider Nephila
clavipes is one of the best-characterised natural silks, notable in respect of its singular me-
chanical properties [1]. The spinning process itself, however, i.e., the structural transition
undergone by ﬁbroins initially dispersed in the aqueous environment of the gland, culmi-
nating with the extrusion of water-insoluble ﬁber, remains relatively poorly understood [2].
Recent in vitro experiments [3] have suggested that the solution in the gland enters a ne-
matic (or twisted nematic) liquid crystalline state, which might play a rheological role in
the spinning process and hence aﬀect the mechanical quality of the extruded ﬁber [4].

Interestingly, Gatesy et al. [5] have argued that, in the evolutionary context, mechanical
performance of natural silks exerts a particularly acute selection pressure on the amino-
acid sequence of the constituent ﬁbroin molecules. A stabilizing source of selection pressure
appears necessary to explain the remarkably long evolutionary timescale (∼125 million years)
over which the characteristic repeated-motif sequences of orb-weaving spiders have remained
essentially unchanged. In this regard, correspondence between sequence and the ability to
form a liquid crystalline phase in the gland, aﬀecting spinning conditions, and hence dragline
quality, would present a relevant perspective.

Our objective here is to tentatively establish such a connection, addressing at the molec-
ular level how nematic order emerges in the gland, and is controlled by sequence-related
parameters. We develop from the premise that the dragline ﬁbroin solution belongs to a
general class of ﬁbrillizing globular protein systems of which hemoglobin S is a well-known
example [6]. The globules of these systems assemble reversibly into supramolecular rod-like
structures, which, beyond a critical axial ratio, undergo a nematic ordering transition.

The details of the assembly process are as follows. We identify three generic sources of
protein-protein interaction contributing to an eﬀective binding potential between ﬁbroins.
The principal contribution derives from the free energy of transfer ∆F of nonpolar amino
acid from a hydrophobic environment to water - the so-called hydrophobic eﬀect. According
to data collated and interpreted by Dill et al. [7], ∆F has a magnitude of approximately 2
kcal/mol, increasing with temperature up to a maximum at 60-80oC:

1

∆F (T ) = ∆H 0 + ∆Cp(T − T0) − T [∆S0 + ∆Cp ln(T /T0)],

where ∆H 0 = 0 and ∆S0 = −6.7 cal/K/mol are the enthalpy and entropy of transfer at
room temperature T0 = 298K, and ∆Cp = 55 cal/K/mol is the heat capacity.

If we assume that each ﬁbroin monomer is in a dense-packed roughly spherical globular
state (radius r), the hydrophobic eﬀect generates an eﬀective ﬁbroin-ﬁbroin binding potential

γh ≃ nh∆F (T ) ∼ 10 cal/mol/˚A2,

(1)

per unit area of surface buried at the binding contact, where, with a ∼ 1nm a characteristic
residue lengthscale, nh ∼ a−2 is the area density of hydrophobic residues exposed at the
globule surface.

Dispersion forces likewise favour association, but contribute a much smaller term [8]

A
24πa2 < 1cal/mol/˚A2,
where the Hamaker constant A gives the strength of water-mediated dispersion interaction
between amino-acids residues, This estimate assumes A ≃ 500 cal/mol, as for typical alkane
chains in water [8].

γd =

Thirdly, the silk ﬁbroin sequence [9] features a number NArg ∼ 20 of arginine residues,
which carry a positive charge at normal pH [10]. These residues generate an electrostatic
double layer eﬀect which we can examine, to a ﬁrst approximation, by treating ﬁbroin
globules as conducting spheres each carrying a charge αNArg, where the ‘degree of ionization’
α reﬂects the extent to which the solvent is able to penetrate into the globule interior.

The free energy of formation of the double layer is [11]

(r >> ξ),

where ξ is the Debye screening length, and ǫ ≃ 7 × 10−11 F/m is the dielectric constant of
water. The limit r >> ξ is appropriate at salt concentrations beyond the order of 10−2M,
for which the Debye length is comparable with the amino-acid residue dimension, ξ ∼ a.

A negative contribution to the binding potential per unit area of ﬁbroin-ﬁbroin interface

follows from the unfavourable cost of breaking up this double layer,

We observe that binding is only feasible if the degree of ionization is very low, since oth-
erwise only three or four arginine residues would be suﬃcient to generate magnitudes
γe ∼ −10 cal/mol/˚A2 comparable with the hydrophobic term, hence preventing association.
The buried surface area of a ﬁbroin embedded within a supramolecular mesogen scales
with the ﬁbroin size as r2, yielding for the net binding free energy due to the respective
contributions

Eb = const × r2(γh + γd + γe),

where the constant is a geometrical factor of order ∼ 4π which depends on the morphology of
the supramolecular structure. In a ‘close-packed’ estimate for r, we have r/a = (3N/4π)1/3 ≃
6, where N ∼ 700 is the total number of residues per globule according to the sequence data
[9].

The binding potential is attractive when the hydrophobic term dominates over the elec-
trostatic repulsion, yielding magnitudes Eb ∼ 10RT cal/mol. In order to relate Eb to meso-
gen assembly, we adopt a well-known approximate result of generalized Flory-Huggins lattice
statistics [12], giving for the mean axial ratio of rods reversibly assembled from associating
monomers at volume fraction Φ [13],

x(Φ, T ) = s−3Φ1/2 exp(Eb/2RT ).

(5)

Here s speciﬁes the number of monomer ‘strands’ in the rod cross-section. In the example
of hemoglobin S ﬁbrils, s = 14 entwined strands have been identiﬁed from crystallographic
data [6]. Unfortunately, in the absence of similar data for silk ﬁbrils in the major ampullate
gland, s is an unknown parameter in the present context [14].

Nematic-isotropic coexistence is naively calculated in Fig.1 (for a hypothetical choice of
s), by solving Onsager-like criteria [15] deﬁning respectively the isotropic (I) and nematic
(I) nodal lines bounding the biphasic region,

x(Φ, T )|I = 5/Φ

x(Φ, T )|N = 8/Φ.

(6)

In this type of calculation, we neglect thermodynamic coupling between nematic ordering
and mesogen assembly [16], and related coupling to polydispersity [17] and ﬂexibility [18] of
the mesogens. Anisotropic electrostatic [19] and dispersion force [20] contributions to the
eﬀective mesogen-mesogen interaction, which is purely steric in the Onsager approach, are
similarly neglected.

In summary, we have shown that it is feasible for silk solutions to exhibit nematic liquid
crystalline order along broadly similar lines to the hemoglobin S mechanism. The hydropho-
bic eﬀect drives thermodynamically reversible assembly of supramolecular mesogens, which
are capable of ordering according to an Onsager-like criterion.

This interpretation remains only tentative, insofar as we do not have cystallographic data
to hand against which to elucidate structural features of ﬁbroin monomers and ﬁbrils which
are implicit to the approach. In particular, values for s, characterising mesogen morphology,
and nh, specifying the hydrophobic surface topology of ﬁbroin monomers, are unknown.

The strong sensitivity of the model to these parameters, along with unspeciﬁed geometri-
cal constants, renders the semi-quantitative phase diagram calculated in the ﬁgure somewhat
academic. However, the reentrant nature of the phase diagram, reﬂecting the temperature
dependence of the hydrophobic eﬀect, presents a strong qualitative signature which might
be looked for experimentally.

There is some scope for comment on the suggestion that spiders regulate their silk gland
in vivo by pumping in additional protons and salts (see [21] and references therein). Accord-
ing to our Eqns (3-4), there is a strengthening of the net ﬁbroin-ﬁbroin binding potential
in response to added salt, due to increased screening of the electrostatic double layer repul-
sion, which should favour mesogen assembly and the onset of a nematic phase. This is in
line with very recent observations of Chen et al. [21], who report that nanoﬁbril formation

3

can be induced in Nephila senegalensis major ampullate ﬁbroin solutions by the addition
of KCl. These authors also observe a marked transition in the rheological character of the
solution occuring between pH 6.4 and 6.8, which provides us with some justiﬁcation for the
signiﬁcance attributed in the model to histidine residues (pK value 6.5).

Finally, the model aﬀords some insight into how sequence mutations might be expected
to interfere with liquid crystallinity of the ﬁbroin solution. The strong shift of the biphasic
region calculated in the ﬁgure, for example, roughly reﬂects a single site hydrophobic→ polar
mutation in the surface of the interacting globules. We infer that mutations are in general
easily capable of disrupting the dragline spinning process by rendering the nematic phase
physiologically inaccessible. Arguably, this has attendant consequences for the evolution of
the ﬁbroins. Sequence mutations which interfere with liquid crystallinity are discouraged
by selection pressure, since by disrupting the spinning process they would also degrade
mechanical performance of the extruded dragline.

[13] The timescale governing this assembly process is critical to the functional context of
the major ampullate gland. For diﬀusion-limited association kinetics we have by a well-

water, from which we estimate a functionally plausible τ ∼1ms.

[15] The Onsager theory interprets athermal nematic ordering of monodisperse hard rods
as the result of competition between orientiational entropy and orientation-dependent
excluded volume. The general form of the coexistence criteria quoted here is also arrived
at in a lattice approach due to Flory, although the two theories predict diﬀerent values
of the constant factors which we have taken as 5 and 8. See L. Onsager, Ann. N.Y.

Disorder in DNA-Linked Gold Nanoparticle Assemblies

We report experimental observations on the eﬀect of disorder on the phase behavior of DNA-linked
nanoparticle assemblies. Variation in DNA linker lengths results in diﬀerent melting temperatures
of the DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies. We observed an unusual trend of a non-monotonic
“zigzag” pattern in the melting temperature as a function of DNA linker length. Linker DNA re-
sulting in unequal DNA duplex lengths introduces disorder and lowers the melting temperature of
the nanoparticle system. Comparison with free DNA thermodynamics shows that such an anoma-
lous zigzag pattern does not exist for free DNA duplex melting, which suggests that the disorder
introduced by unequal DNA duplex lengths results in this unusual collective behavior of DNA-linked
nanoparticle assemblies.

DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies are a novel sys-
tem in which gold nanoparticles are chemically aﬃxed to
known DNA sequences to create DNA “probes” with the
capability to self-assemble into aggregates [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The interaction potential between these colloids are tun-
able and controllable, which makes these multicompo-
nent complex ﬂuids particularly suitable for studying the
link between the interaction potential and phase behav-
ior
[6, 7]. Similar colloidal phase transitions have also
been used to detect the protein interactions at membrane
surfaces [8]. On the other hand, the dynamics of DNA
melting and hybridization in DNA replication and tran-
scription is also a subject of intense investigation [9, 10].
The change in optical property upon aggregation
makes DNA-linked nanoparticle systems a potential tool
in future DNA detection technology [11, 12]. DNA de-
tection is important in medical research for applications
such as detection of genetic diseases, RNA proﬁling, and
biodefense [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The DNA-linked nanopar-
ticle detection systems utilize the sequence-dependent
hybridization of DNA for accuracy and the optical prop-
erties of colloidal gold for sensitivity to create a DNA
detection method that changes color upon the introduc-
tion of a speciﬁc DNA sequence. Study of these DNA-
gold nanoparticle assemblies is warranted to gain a funda-
mental understanding of DNA hybridization in conﬁned
geometries, as well as to probe the potential of this and
similar systems for practical applications in biotechnol-
ogy [18, 19].

Much like other colloidal suspensions [20, 21, 22], the
DNA-gold nanoparticle system has been shown to ex-
hibit interesting phase behavior. The assembly melting
temperature is dependent upon parameters such as par-
ticle size, DNA composition, and electrolyte concentra-
tions [1, 2]. Recent theory has sought to explain these
observations
[6, 23, 24]. More study is necessary to
fully understand the underlying mechanisms aﬀecting the
phase behavior of this system.

Here we report experimental observations of the ef-
fects of disorder on the melting temperature of the DNA-

linked nanoparticle assemblies [2, 3]. The basic building
block is illustrated in Fig. 1. Disorder in the DNA duplex
length was introduced by choosing linker DNA with an
odd number of bases. We studied the melting temper-
ature as a function of DNA linker length. The melting
temperature accesses the stability of systems. DNA gold
nanoparticle probes were synthesized using previously de-
scribed methods [2]. DNA-gold aggregates were formed
by mixing probe DNA particles with linker DNA [2, 3, 4].
Upon the addition of linker DNA, the solutions were al-
lowed to stand at 4 ◦C for several days in order to achieve
maximum network aggregation.

Simple DNA sequences with uniform base composition
were chosen in order to remove complications resulting
from sequence-dependent eﬀects. The probe sequences
used in these experiments consisted of 11 identical bases

in a row and one “discriminator” base at the terminus
that is not thiol modiﬁed (see Fig. 1).
In this system,
when gold-attached DNA probes aligned to bind with a
speciﬁc linker sequence, the two “G” bases at the end
of each probe met in the middle. These bases served to
ensure that every linker sequence hybridized by aligning
with the two G bases in the center. Hybridizing any
other way will result in at least two base pair mismatches,
which is much less stable than a fully complementary
bond and, therefore, will not be present in any signiﬁcant
amount in our aggregates.

We chose linker DNA sequences to observe the eﬀect
of linker length on the DNA-gold nanoparticle system.
Gold-attached DNA clusters were prepared using linkers
that ranged from 24 to 16 bases in length. The linker
concentration was adjusted to be oversaturated so the
melting temperature does not depend on linker concen-
tration [6, 25]. Typical 10 nm gold and DNA linker con-
centrations were ∼4×1017 particles/l and 7×10−6 M, re-
spectively. Melting curves of corresponding DNA free of
gold nanoparticles were measured for comparison [2, 3].
Melting of the system is observed at 260 nm, heating the
solution at a rate of 1 ◦C/min.

Experimental melting curves detailing the typical
melting behavior of DNA-linked nanoparticle networks,
in which linkers of varying length were used, are given
in Fig. 2. ¿From the data it is evident that the melt-
ing of these aggregates produce a sharp melting transi-
tion. More interestingly, we noticed that linker sequences
with 21 and 23 bases melted at lower temperatures than
linkers with 20 and 22 bases, respectively, as shown in
Fig. 3(a).

To identify the cause of this anomaly in Tm, we com-
pared the thermodynamic parameters of corresponding
DNA that are not attached to gold nanoparticles. The
experimental results of using free DNA counterparts in
similar experimental conditions are shown in Fig. 3(a).
The melting temperature of a free DNA duplex increases
as the number of base pairs increases and does not dis-
play this anomaly. In contrast, the melting temperature

of gold-attached DNA duplexes oscillates. Tm increases
with linker length when a linker has an even number of
bases and decreases when it has an odd number. This
behavior is also observed on a system with a diﬀerent
particle size, as demonstrated in Fig. 2, where the Tm
data for aggregates formed using 20 nm gold particles
have a similar trend.

The melting temperatures of free DNA duplexes were
predicted using experimental thermodynamic parame-
ters. The thermodynamic relationship describing the free
energy of a system is given by

∆G0 = ∆H 0 − T ∆S0.

The melting temperature of a DNA duplex is deﬁned as
the midpoint between aggregated and dispersed phases
in the absorption curves [26]. At that temperature the
concentration of single-stranded DNA is equal to that of
double-stranded DNA. A widely used equation to calcu-
late Tm, taking into account inﬂuence from nearest neigh-
bor interactions and salt concentration, gives the melting
temperature of a duplex as [27, 28]

The change in enthalpy, ∆H 0, and the change in en-
tropy, ∆S0, for a given DNA duplex were calculated by
using nearest neighbor parameters [27, 28]. The free en-
ergy change, ∆G0, was estimated using Eq. (1). A sample
calculation for a DNA duplex formed using two 12 base
probes and 16 base linker DNA is illustrated below.

Since the sugar-phosphate backbone of the two probe
DNAs are not connected [see Fig. 1(a)], the DNA double
helix melts more like two duplexes. Therefore, a duplex
formed using two 12 base probes and a 16 base linker
melts at a temperature similar to that of a DNA double
helix with eight base pairs. The calculated thermody-
namic values are given in Table I. Figure 3(a) shows
that the experimentally observed free DNA melting tem-
peratures are described well by Eq. (2), with a deviation
apparent as the DNA duplex length approaches 12 bases;
it is known that Eq. (2) is accurate up to 12 bases and
becomes less accurate for longer sequences [27]. In the
DNA-linked nanoparticles, however, Tm does not increase
monotonically with linker DNA length. Speciﬁcally, the
Tm of 21 and 23 base linkers were found to be lower than
that of 20 and 22 base linkers, respectively.

The Tm and associated error bars for DNA linked to
10 nm nanoparticles were determined from the averages
and standard deviations from four separate data sets.
The error bars are likely an overestimate of error in Tm
trend because systematic error leads to a constant shift of
Tm with each data set. Parameters such as salt concen-
tration, grafting density, and linker concentration that
will aﬀect the Tm are kept constant within each data set
by using the probe sample from the same batch of solu-
tion and keeping the linker concentration constant. To
compare data within a given set, where systematic errors
are minimized, we plot the change in melting tempera-
ture, ∆Tm = Tm(x) − Tm(x − 1), versus number of bases
in the linker sequence, x. Figure 3(b) demonstrates that
linker lengths of 19, 21, and 23 are lower than expected,
and this is true for both 10 and 20 nm nanoparticle sys-
tems. We found that the Tm decreased when increasing
linker length from from 20 to 21 and from 22 to 23 bases.
While an increase from 18 to 19 bases does not result in
a negative ∆Tm, the ∆Tm is near zero and signiﬁcantly
smaller than the predictions for free DNA.

This anomaly in Tm is unique in the DNA-linked
nanoparticle system, and it does not result from the DNA
duplex formation free energy, as illustrated in Fig. 2.
Careful examination of the linker compositions reveals
that, for linkers with an even number of bases, the DNA

duplexes formed are composed of a uniform DNA length
while those with an odd number of bases form duplexes
composed of two diﬀerent DNA lengths. For example, a
21 base linker results in a connection composed of one
11 base and one 10 base duplex (11-10), whereas a 20
base linker results in a (10-10). While an 11 base du-
plex is more stable than a 10 base duplex, an assembly
with the disorder introduced by the 11-10 duplex results
in a lowering of the overall stability, hence the melting
temperature, of the system.

To verify that introducing a diﬀerent DNA duplex
length, which introduces binding energy disorder, is re-
sponsible for lowering the melting temperature, we tested
linkers of the same length with diﬀerent sequences, as
shown in Fig. 1(b). We compared three 20 base link-
ers, (10-10), (11-9), and (12-8). We found that Tm(10-
10)> Tm(11-9)> Tm(12-8). Typical melting curves for
these experiments are given in Fig. 4(a). Similar results
are demonstrated for 22 base linkers, Tm(11-11)> Tm(12-
10). This leads to a conclusion that,
in DNA-linked
nanoparticle assemblies, duplexes with diﬀerent lengths
introduces binding energy disorder and, therefore, lower
the stability of the system. Since the energetics of cor-
responding free DNA duplexes do not result in such an
unusual Tm trend, we believe such an eﬀect is largely a
result of entropic cooperativity [6, 25].

(b) Melting temperature as a function of the shortest DNA

bution.

The eﬀect of having two DNA duplexes of diﬀerent
length on the stability of DNA-linked nanoparticle assem-
blies is illustrated in Fig. 4(b). The stability is not sim-
ply dominated by the shorter duplex, as demonstrated in
Fig. 4(b), where Tm is plotted as a function of the shorter
duplex length. In the case of a DNA linker composed of
one 10 base duplex, Tm(12-10)< Tm(11-10)< Tm(10-10).
This suggests that the larger the length diﬀerence is be-
tween the two duplexes, the less stable the aggregate will
become. However, a decrease in binding energy per base
has a larger percentage eﬀect on shorter DNAs, so the
unusual trend in Tm for nine base and shorter duplexes
can been seen only quantitatively.

In summary, we found that disorder has a strong eﬀect
on the stability in the DNA-linked nanoparticle assem-
blies. We have demonstrated that using linker DNA that
results in the presence of two duplexes of diﬀerent length
and energy in such a system lowers the overall stability of
network formed. The interaction energy is easily tunable
by changing the DNA composition, which makes this sys-
tem particularly suitable for studying various aspects of
colloidal phase transitions.

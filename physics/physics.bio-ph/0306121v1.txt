Abstract

The ATP-driven Plasma Membrane Calcium (PMCA) pump is characterized by a high
aﬃnity to calcium and a low transport rate compared to other transmembrane calcium
transport proteins. It plays a crucial role for calcium extrusion from cells. Calmodulin
is an intracellular calcium buﬀering protein which is capable in its Ca2+ liganded
form to stimulate the PMCA pump by increasing both, the aﬃnity to calcium and
the maximum calcium transport rate. We introduce a new model of this stimulation
process and deduce analytical expressions for experimental observables in order to
determine the model parameter on the basis of speciﬁc experiments. Furthermore a
model for the pumping activity is developed. In contrast to the biological process we
have to describe the pumping rate behavior by assuming a ATP:Ca2+ stoichiometry
of 2 in order to reproduce experimental data. The conjunction of the description
of calcium pumping and the stimulation model fully and correctly simulates PMCA
pump function. Therewith the model enables us to draw conclusions from and make
propositions about the biological processes involved in PMCA pump activity. For
example, we found the need for the separation of the calcium-calmodulin complex
attachment to the pump and the stimulation step. The presented model can also serve
as a tool for calcium dynamics simulations and provides the possibility to characterize
diﬀerent pump isoforms by diﬀerent type-speciﬁc parameter sets.

Introduction

The Plasma Membrane Calcium pump with a high calcium aﬃnity (K1/2 < 0.5 − 1µM
(1, 2, 3)) and a low transport rate (≈ 30Hz (4) and private communication) is an important
component for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis. By using the energy stored in ATP
the PMCA pump transports intracellular calcium ions out of the cell. It has been found
in all mammalian cells (5), where the expression level does not exceed 0.1% of the total
membrane protein (1, 6, 7, 8). An exception is the brain where this value is up to 10 times
higher than in nonexcitable cells (5).

The four diﬀerent pump isoforms are encoded by four independent genes, which are
indicated by numbers 1-4. The diversity of pump forms is further increased by alternative

mRNA splicing variants, characterized by small letters. There exist more than 26 tran-
scripts which diﬀer in their regulatory properties, for instance in their aﬃnity to calmodulin,
and are distributed in a tissue speciﬁc manner (1, 3). Referring to the available data (9)
we will investigate hPMCA2b and hPMCA4b, where h stands for human.

Calmodulin is an intracellular calcium buﬀering protein with four relatively high aﬃnity
Ca2+ binding cites (Ka = 106 − 107M−1 at low ionic strength (10)).
It belongs to the
mobile proteins of the EF-hand family with a helix-loop-helix conformation (11). At each
case two calcium are bound at the N-terminal as well as at the highly homologous C-
terminal domain, each of them formed by two EF-hands (8). The domains are connected
by a ﬂexible linker (8). By binding calcium, the buﬀer calmodulin is important for the
spatial propagation of calcium signals within the cytoplasm. Additionally the fully liganded
calmodulin-calcium complex (CaM·Ca4) is responsible for Ca2+-dependent regulation of
the activities of a vast array of diﬀerent target proteins, including enzymes, ion pumps
and channels (12). Among those with high aﬃnity (Kd=5 nM) to the calmodulin-calcium
complex is the PMCA pump (13). The free CaM-binding domain of the PMCA pump also
interacts with the ATP-binding site of the pump and acts as an inhibitor of ATP-driven
pump function (7, 14). The relieving of that autoinhibitory domain segment after the
binding of CaM·Ca4 causes a stimulation of pump function by increasing both, the aﬃnity
to calcium and the maximum turnover rate of calcium (2, 3, 8, 15). The stimulation and
the relaxation to the initial unstimulated state happens on a time scale of minutes and
enables the pump to display a memory to previous calcium transients (9).

Caride et al. have published a model in conjuction with measurements of the dynamical
stimulation behavior (9). With an extention of the reaction scheme we aim to eliminate two
problems of that model. At ﬁrst the stimulation parameter cannot be deduced from the
measured data. Secondly, the stimulation rate of the pump can be arbitrarily increased
by raising the calcium concentration in the model. Whereas converging experimentally
measured stimulation constants call for a limitation by a maximum value at high calcium
concentrations. We separate the stimulation as well as the relaxation into two steps and
introduce rate limiting reactions in our model. An analytical approach enables us to
deduce the required rate constants from measurements. Starting from the chemical model
equations by using the law of mass action we deduce a system of linear coupled diﬀerential
equations which we solve numerically. The presented new model is in agreement with the
investigated experimental data of the stimulation process by calmodulin. Furthermore we
predict stimulation behavior of so far undone measurements.

Beside the stimulation model we also consider the calcium pumping activity. This joined
model of stimulation and pumping is therefore capable to serve as a tool for simulations in
a wide variety of systems such as tissues or single cells. For that purpose we assume the
same way of function for all isoforms and characterize the diﬀerent isoforms by type speciﬁc
sets of parameter. Therewith we diﬀerentiate between universal system type independent
parameter which are characteristic for a pump type and speciﬁc parameter such as the
PMCA pump protein expression level, which has to be adapted to each experimental setup.
In relation to the available experiments we can specify parameter sets for the h2b and h4b
isoform.

At the beginning we introduce the stimulation model equations. Starting from the ex-
planation of pump activity measurements we deduce an expression for the stimulation and
the relaxation constants from that model. With the adaption of the theoretical expression
for the stimulation and the relaxation constant to measured data we determine the model
parameter and are able to calculate stimulation dynamics. In the second part of this paper

2

we focus on the derivation of an expression for the calcium pumping activity. Finally the
stimulation and the pumping model together serve to fully describe PMCA pump function.

Model

Stimulation model

We base the stimulation model on a system of rate equations, which describe the calcium
and calmodulin dependent transition from unstimulated to stimulated pump form and vice
versa. The stimulation dynamics of an ensemble of PMCA pumps is characterized by the
equations:

CaM + 4Ca2+

k5⇁ P .

We use the following abbreviations: P denotes free PMCA pump, CaM ·Ca4 ≡ C, P ·
CaM ·Ca4 ≡ P C, P ·CaM ·Ca4
∗ ≡ P C ∗ and P ∗ is free stimulated pump. The asterisk
denotes stimulated pump forms. CaM and Ca2+ is free calmodulin and calcium within
the cell. The k’s are the rate constants of the accordant equation and direction. Equation
1 describes the buﬀering of calcium by calmodulin. We simplify the cooperative binding of
Ca2+ within each domain of the calmodulin protein (10) by this reaction, meaning a highly
cooperative binding of all the four calcium ions. Based on the realistic assumption that
the buﬀering of calcium occurs faster than the PMCA pump stimulation, which happens
on a time scale of minutes, we treat this binding to be in quasi-steady-state.

The free PMCA pump P and the PMCA pump complexed with calmodulin-calcium,
P C, will be referred to as unstimulated pump forms. P C ∗ is the stimulated PMCA pump
form bound with C whereas P ∗ is free stimulated pump. The assumption of irreversible
steps 3 - stimulation - and 5 - relaxation - mean, the pump can only be stimulated after C
has attached to the pump, whereas recovery to the unstimulated pump form only occurs
after C has detached. It will be seen later on that these irreversible steps cause a limiting of
the stimulation and relaxation rate, i.e. both cannot exceed the rates k3 or k5 respectively.
Note that we introduced diﬀerent pathways for the stimulation (equations 2 and 3)
and the relaxation process (equations 4 and 5). This enables us to describe the temporal
behavior of these two processes independently. We think that this is a rather realistic
assumption since the underlying transformational changes are considered as discriminative
processes.

Stimulation parameter determination

(i = ±1, ±2, 3, ±4, 5)
We aim to deduce a connection between the rate constants ki
introduced by the stimulation model (equations 1 - 5) and the stimulation and relaxation
constants kexp
relax measured in experiment. In order to do that it will be explain

stim and kexp

3

how Caride et al. obtained these stimulation constants form measurements of PMCA pump
activity. Starting from the stimulation model we deduce an analytical expression for kstim
and krelax, respectively.

Measurement The pumping rate can be determined by measuring the kinetics of inor-
ganic phosphate P hi release (whereas sub-i refers to inorganic) (16). The total amount of
produced P hi by hydrolyzing ATP during a single turnover of the pump is proportional to
the optical density at 360nm (16). Caride et al. in 2001 (9) used this in order to measure
the total amount of produced P hi. It is rather likely that during a single turnover of the
PMCA pump one ATP is hydrolyzed as well as one calcium ion transported (1, 3, 7).
Therefore the rate of P hi production directly corresponds to the calcium pumping rate.

Stimulation of the PMCA pump means an increase of the calcium turnover rate, hence
an increase in the P hi production rate. The total production of P hi during the stimulation
procedure between t0 and t is

P hi(t) = P h0 +

∗ vunstim(Ca2+) +

t

Zt0 (cid:20)

(P + P C)
P0

(P ∗ + P C ∗)

(6)

Where vunstim and vstim represent the production rates of P hi as well as the calcium pump-
ing rates at the present intracellular calcium concentration in unstimulated and stimulated
state, respectively. P h0 refers to the amount of P hi at t0 and P0 is the total PMCA pump
concentration with P0 = P + P C + P C ∗ + P ∗, corresponding to the conservation of the
total pump mass. More details concerning the P hi production rate expression are found
in the “Pumping model” section (see equation 25).

The pumping rates are multiplied by the fraction of unstimulated or stimulated pump
form. As a ﬁrst approximation the alteration during the progress of the stimulation of
these fractions is assumed to follow single exponential functions

with ∆v = vstim − vunstim and t0 = 0.

The single exponential approximations 7 and 8 do not take the steady-state distribution
into account, hence they reproduce experimentally measured P hi production only in the
beginning of the stimulation or relaxation process. We will consider the steady-state behav-
ior below. The ﬁt of equation 9 and 10 to the measured P hi production during stimulation
and relaxation, respectively, yields the stimulation constant kexp
stim and the relaxation con-
stant kexp
relax, respectively, as single exponential ﬁt parameter (for further details please refer
to (16, 17)).

Figure 1: For isoforms h2b and h4b, k3
stim is plotted against calcium (full lines) at constant
calmodulin concentration of 0.117 µM. The dotted lines represent the k3
stim dependence on
calmodulin at ﬁxed calcium concentration of 1 µM. The stimulation rate data (squares) has
been measured at various calcium concentration with constant calmodulin concentration
of 0.117 µM (with kind permission of Caride (9)).

Stimulation We deduce now an analytical expression for kstim from the above presented
stimulation model (equations 1-5). Suppose only unstimulated pump form P to be present
and calmodulin is added. In the beginning stage the stimulation model can be reduced
to the rate equations 1, 2 and 3. The binding of calcium to calmodulin (rate equation 1)
ought to be in quasi-steady-state, therefore

C ≡ CaM ·Ca4 = K ∗ CaM ∗ Ca4.

(11)

The equilibrium constant K = k1/k−1 was taken from Linse et al.
(10). During the
beginning of the stimulation the ﬁnite calmodulin concentration puts no restriction to the
process, since only a minor fraction of free C will be bound. Therefore the calmodulin
concentration conservation is neglected and CaM is considered to be constant. With
this assumption and the pump mass conservation P0 = P + P C + P C ∗ (note that P ∗
is not involved here) reaction equations 2 and 3 can be rewritten by applying the law of
mass action into a system of three linear homogeneous diﬀerential equations of ﬁrst order.
The system is solved via the ansatz P = A ∗ exp(−kstimt), P C = B ∗ exp(−kstimt) and
P C ∗ = C ∗ exp(−kstimt). The characteristic equation leads to three solutions for kstim:

Regarding the analytical expression 12, k3
stim converges to k3 for large calcium or calmodulin
concentrations (see Appendix), hence k3 conﬁnes the maximum stimulation rate and can
be identiﬁed with kmax
stim. This corresponds to the introduction of equation 3 with which we
aimed to get a limitation of the stimulation rate. Knowing that and setting equation 12
equal to k3/2, an expression for the half maximum concentration can be deduced

Note that the calmodulin concentration is kept constant. With the knowledge of k3 equa-
tion 14 gets a relation between k2 and k−2.

Presently, only measurements of the calcium dependence of kstim are available, data of
the calmodulin dependence are lacking. But with equation 12 and the so far determined
parameter it is possible to quote the calmodulin dependence of the stimulation constant.
In ﬁgure 1 we propose the behavior of kstim(CaM ), which yields directly from equation 12
with the use of equation 14. Provided the experimental data have a similar behavior, they
can be ﬁtted by

Each ﬁt, for the calcium- (equation 18) or the calmodulin-dependent (equation 19)
case delivers two ﬁt parameter kmax
stim , which determine k3 and
a relation between k2 and k−2. Data of the calmodulin dependence would not provide
further informations since Ca(1/2)
stim are redundant. But with the calcium ﬁt
parameter we are able to propose the calmodulin dependence of kstim.

Relaxation We apply the same procedure as for the stimulation process to the relaxation
of the stimulated PMCA pump. Suppose only stimulated pump form P C ∗ to be present.
The beginning stage of the relaxation can be reduced to equations 4 and 5. With the pump
mass conservation P0 = P C ∗ + P ∗ + P , the equivalent calculation leads to three solutions

and the relation between k4 and k−4 only out of the calcium ﬁt parameter. But these allow
us to propose the calmodulin dependence of krelax.

With the data provided by Caride et al. and the described procedure we can quote
parameter sets for two isoforms (see table 1). Attention should be drawn to the fact, that
Ca2+ is bound by polar amino acids of calmodulin and therefore the aﬃnity represented
by K strongly depends on the ionic strength of the experimental solution (10). The here
used value of K at 150 mM KCl from the publication of Linse et al. 1991 ﬁts best the
experimental conditions of 30 mM Tes-TEA, pH 7.2 and 120 mM KCl of Caride et al. (for
more details see (9, 10)).

As already mentioned, the half activation ﬁt parameter only provide a relation between
k2 and k−2 as well as k4 and k−4 but with restrictions from k−2 > 0 and k5 > k4 (see table
1). k−2 and k4 are related to k2 and k−4 via equations 14, 16 and 20, 21, respectively. In
addition, we have more informations related to the choice of k−2, k4, k2 and k−4. Note that
we have derived equations 12 and 17 only by concerning the beginning of the stimulation
or the relaxation. Without that simpliﬁcation the velocity of the exact stimulation and
relaxation process, if measured, would further conﬁne the range of these parameter. The
steady-state graph which will be discussed below, and also the slopes of the raising faces in
ﬁgures 1 and 2 are correlated with k−2, k4, k2 and k−4. So far we can use the informations
from the steady-state graph and the slopes in ﬁgure 1 and 2, with which we determine the
parameter set in table 2, which will be used for all further calculations. Note that the exact
stimulation and relaxation velocity provides the most relevant additional information in
order to restrict the ranges in table 1.

Stimulation dynamics Finally based on the stimulation model 1-5 we can simulate the
pumping state dynamics of the PMCA pump, i.e. unstimulated and stimulated. With the
obtained isoform speciﬁc parameters, statements on dynamical stimulation and relaxation

to h4b suggests a faster stimulation, whereas the decay of stimulated pump form occurs
faster for the h4b isoform since kh4b

With the reaction rates shown in table 1 and 2 we solve the system of coupled diﬀerential
equations numerically (see equation 26, 27 and 28 in Appendix). The stimulation and
relaxation dynamics of both isoforms can be seen in ﬁgure 3. In ﬁgure 3 (a) we start with
no present stimulated pump form fstim = 0 at t0 and expose the pump to a high calcium
concentration. Whereas in the relaxation graph 3 (b) only stimulated pump form fstim = 1
is available at t0 and the calcium concentration is decreased to 0.1 µM.

Pumping model

Up to here we described the temporal transition between unstimulated and stimulated
pump forms. In this section we will mathematically describe how the PMCA pump trans-
ports calcium ions through the membrane in dependence of the intracellular calcium con-
centration. We will consider the transport process to be in quasi-steady-state, i.e. the
pump activity reacts immediately on the intracellular calcium concentration. This sim-
pliﬁcation is justiﬁed, since the adaption of pumping to diﬀerent calcium concentrations
happens within milli seconds and the stimulation/relaxation on a time scale of minutes.

Pumping activity In contrast to the Ca2+ pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA)
the stoichiometry between transported Ca2+ and hydrolyzed ATP of the PMCA pump is
most likely 1:1 (1, 3, 7). The SERCA pump works with a calcium:ATP ratio of 2:1. For a
simple approach, we neglect the conformal change of the pump P during transport. Then

the transport cycle expressed in rate equations becomes

which is similar to the Michaelis and Menten enzyme model (1913). Note, that we have
replaced all the subtleties of diﬀusion of calcium to and from the intracellular binding site
and the time resolution of the calcium transport through the membrane by rate constants.
Since ATP is suﬃciently available in cells we treat the ATP concentration as thermodynam-
ical bath. From chemical kinetics, the steady-state expression for the calcium transport
rate J (1) in the outward direction is

J (1) =

Ca is the free intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+
in]. This equation for the transport
rate J (1) has the same form as a Hill equation with Hill coeﬃcient n = 1. t2 can be identiﬁed
with the maximal pump rate J (1)
max. Since the maximum rate of the reaction is limited by the

out, t2 = J (1)
max stands for the saturating properties
dissociation reaction P -Ca
of the pumping process. H1/2 = t−1+t2
is referred to as half activation concentration and
it is a measure for the aﬃnity of the pump to calcium.

Considering the experimentally measured transport rate in the absence of calmodulin,
equation 23 fails to reproduce the slope of the raising face between almost no pump activity
and saturated pump activity (see ﬁgure 4). This is also the case for experiments performed
by Elwess et al. (15) or by Verma et al. (18). The steady-state Ca-dependent PMCA
pump activity can be described better by a Hill equation with Hill coeﬃcient n = 2,

In ﬁgure 4 the diﬀerence between ﬁts with n = 1 and n = 2 in the calmodulin absent case
are shown. At the moment we do not know how equation 24 could be biologically justiﬁed.
Theoretically this equation can be deduced from a transport cycle with a stoichiometry 2:1
of Ca:ATP and by assuming the binding of the two calcium ions to be cooperatively. But
as mentioned above, stoichiometry 2:1 is not the case for the PMCA pump (1, 2, 3). Even
if there is no obvious biological explanations for equation 24, we will use this expression in
order to adequately describe experimental pumping activity (see discussion).

So far we have only looked at the calcium-dependent pump activity in the absence of
calmodulin without considering the pump stimulation. One single PMCA pump can exist
in two states, either unstimulated or stimulated. The transition dynamics is given by the
stimulation model in equations 1-5. The total pumping rate of a system becomes

where funstim and fstim are the fractions of unstimulated and stimulated pump with

. Note that this has been used already in equation 6
for the dynamical P hi production rate, since the calcium transport is directly connected
with the hydrolization of ATP.

Figure 4: Steady-state calcium dependent pump activity of both isoforms. The measure-
ments in the absence (triangles) and in the presence (circles) of 0.117µM calmodulin have
been kindly provided by Caride (9). The total pump concentration P0 is taken from (9)
to be 0.005µM. The dashed-doted line depicts the pump activity with the assumption
that only stimulated pump form is present at all calcium concentrations, i.e. fstim = 1
and funstim = 0. Whereas the dashed line shows the realistic case, i.e. fstim ≃ 0 for low
calcium concentrations. For the calmodulin absent case the ﬁts with hill coeﬃcient n = 1
(equation 23, doted line) and n = 2 (equation 24, full line) are shown.

One input parameter of the stimulation model is the total pump concentration P0.
This concentration P0 is taken from Caride et al. (9) to be 0.005µM. In contrast to the
stimulation model, the total pump concentration is irrelevant for the pumping model since
we use a probabilistic interpretation in equation 23 and 24. P is the probability to have a
calcium-free pump, P -Ca is the probability of a pump to have bound calcium. The sum
of both is of course 1. We cannot apply the same interpretation to the stimulation model
since the proportion between total calmodulin concentration and total pump concentration
is signiﬁcant. If for example the amount of PMCA pumps exceeds the number of available
calmodulin proteins not all pumps could be stimulated.

For simulations the surface density of PMCA pumps has to be transfered into the con-
centration P0. This implies the neglection of diﬀusion of the calcium-calmodulin complex
to and from the pump. This is justiﬁed for rather small compartments. However, for larger
compartments a space resolving model with a local pump concentration has to be used.

Pumping parameter determination with steady-state pump activity By setting
all diﬀerential equations (Appendix equations 26, 27 and 28) of the stimulation model
1-5 to zero, i.e. no more time dependent change of the stimulation pump states, one
gets the steady-state distribution of P , P C, P C ∗ and P ∗. In dependence of the calcium
and calmodulin concentration and of the rate constants ki (i = ±1, ±2, 3, ±4, 5) we can
therewith calculate the stimulation scenario which the system approaches after a suﬃcient
long time. More informations concerning the mathematics are found in the appendix
(equations 33 - 37). This enables us to calculate the asymptotic steady-state fractions
funstim and fstim in equation 25. Many measurements of the steady-state pump activity

11

in the presence and the absence of calmodulin has been performed (9, 18, 19, 20, 21). The
adaption of equation 25 to one of these experiments delivers Jmax, J ∗
1/2.
In ﬁgure 4 we use the steady-state activity measurements done by Caride et al. (9).

max, H1/2 and H ∗

With funstim = 1 and fstim = 0 in equation 25 we ﬁt the steady-state activity curve
in the absence of calmodulin, i.e. no stimulated pump form is available, which supplies
Jmax and H1/2. Note that this is an immediate answer of the pump to diﬀerent calcium
concentrations, since we use the quasi-steady-state rate expression for the pump activity
(equation 24).

max and H ∗

In the calmodulin present case equation 25 is used in order to ﬁt the data (see dashed line
in ﬁgure 4). We determine J ∗
1/2 with that ﬁt, whereby the steady-state fractions
funstim and fstim are determined by the stimulation model. These calculated fractions
respect the fact, that at lower calcium concentrations in the presence of calmodulin no
stimulated pump form is available (fstim ≃ 0). This can be seen in comparison with the
dashed-doted line in ﬁgure 4, which is plotted with the virtual assumption only stimulated
pump form (fstim = 1) to be present for all calcium concentrations. The gap between
this virtual line (dashed-doted) and the ﬁt of equation 25 (dashed line) at low calcium
concentrations is determined by the choice of the stimulation parameter set of table 1 and
2. Although we determine J ∗
1/2 only
alter the slope and the saturation value whereas the gap at low calcium concentrations is
not inﬂuenced by these changes. That is, J ∗
1/2 do not have inﬂuence in equation
25 at fstim ≃ 0. Here we have a second indication that the parameter set in table 1 and 2
determined via kexp

1/2 with that ﬁt, changes in J ∗

unstim is in good agreement with the experiment.

max and H ∗

max and H ∗

The so obtained parameters Jmax and J ∗

max refer to the investigated system, i.e. they
are determined by the ensemble of investigated pumps. In contrast to the pump rate, the
aﬃnity to calcium expressed by H1/2 or H ∗
1/2 is a universal parameter since it does not
depend on the surface density. With the knowledge of the expression level of PMCA pumps
within the system and the average protein mass one can calculate out of Jmax and J ∗
max
the maximum unstimulated Jsingle and stimulated pumping rate J ∗
single of a single pump
respectively, which is then a system independent parameter. Caride et al. achieved with
the baculovirus expression system an amount of 5% PMCA pumps of the total membrane
protein (private communication). Knowing that and with an overall average protein mass
max = 0.237 µmol/(mg · min)
of 130 kDa (7) we deduced a turnover rate of 10.3 Hz out of J ∗
max = 0.72 µmol/(mg · min) for the stimulated
for the h2b isoform and 31.3 Hz out of J ∗
h4b rate. We treat that single pump pumping rate to be characteristic for the accordant
isoform and therefore a universal parameter for all PMCA pumps of the same isoform.

The collection of all pumping parameters obtained from the steady-state curves in ﬁgure
4 is shown in table 3. The impact of stimulation by calmodulin on PMCA pump function
namely increase in both, the aﬃnity to calcium H1/2 and the maximum pump rate Jmax,
can be aﬃrmed.

With the use of these parameters and the rate constants (table 1 and 2) we can calculate
the calmodulin dependence of the steady-state activity, which is shown in ﬁgure 5 for the
h4b isoform. The displayed fractional steady-state activity f is an universal description,
since it is not dependent on the surface density. The quantitative behavior of our theoretical
plot (ﬁgure 5) is conﬁrmed by ﬁgure 3 in (22) (data not shown). Note that we calculated
f out of the available data without further ﬁtting routines.

Comprehensive PMCA pump dynamics

With the knowledge of both the stimulation parameter from table 1, 2 and the pumping
properties in table 3 we are now able to simulate the time dependent behavior of the
calcium pumping rate of the PMCA pump including the stimulation.

In a corresponding experiment (9) the tissue with PMCA pumps of isoform h2b has
been exposed one after another to diﬀerent calcium concentrations. The time course of
produced P hi is shown in ﬁgure 6 (a) (crosses). It was already pointed out that the P hi
production rate directly corresponds to the calcium transport rate (see “Measurement”
section). Utilizing equation 25, we can calculate and sum up the time course of P hi
production. With the use of the universal parameter sets we adapt our simulation (full
line in ﬁgure 6) to this experiment by adjusting the unknown surface density of PMCA
pumps. Note that we have added a constant base level rate with respect to the non-zero
P hi production rate at Ca = 0µM in ﬁgure 6 (a), which can be related to another source

of P hi within the investigated tissue. In fact, in the absence of calcium no ions can be
transported, i.e. no ATP can be hydrolyzed, no P hi produced. Regarding our simulation,
since the production rate J in equation 25 is equal to zero at Ca = 0µM, P hi remains
constant. Attention should be drawn to the fact, that during the second exposure to 0.5
µM calcium the measured activity signiﬁcantly decreases compared to the ﬁrst time at
high calcium concentration, i.e. even under the same experimental conditions the P hi
production rate changes during the experiments.

After 300 seconds at 0.5 µM calcium, during which a PMCA pump fraction is stim-
ulated, the concentration was decreased to 0.05 µM calcium for diﬀerent durations and
raised again to high calcium concentration. The turnover rate at the end of the second low

Discussion

Our combined model of stimulation and pumping is able to reproduce PMCA pump be-
havior. Therefore the assumptions of the stimulation model could serve as a possible
explanation for the underlying biological steps. An essential element of the model is the
separation of the attachment of the calcium-calmodulin complex to the pump (equation

14

2) and the stimulation, which occurs in an additional step (equation 3). The convergence
of the stimulation constant kexp
stim at high calcium concentrations in ﬁgure 1 provide strong
evidence for that assumption. In the same manner an additional step exists in the pumping
cycle in equation 22. These steps can be seen as an internal conformational change where
its velocity cannot be further speeded up by concentration raises. In contrast to reaction
3 which is conﬁned by the total available pump concentration P0 and k3, the velocity of
reaction 2 can be arbitrarily increased with higher calcium or calmodulin concentrations.
That is, if the stimulation process is connected with equation 2, the stimulation constant
kstim would not saturate at high calcium concentrations. Correspondingly the saturation
at a maximum relaxation constant kexp
unstim in ﬁgure 2 at low calcium concentrations calls
for a rate limiting reaction (equation 5) during relaxation.

The separation between stimulation (equations 2 and 3) and relaxation (equations
4 and 5) process enables us to describe the diﬀerent temporal behaviors independently
which is required since for example isoforms h2b and h4b display opposed stimulation and
relaxation pumping activity behavior, i.e. the h2b isoforms stimulates faster than h4b but
decays slower under the same conditions.

There is a contradiction between the calcium-dependent pumping behavior and the sto-
ichiometry between transported Ca2+ and hydrolyzed ATP. Carafoli already pointed out
that the saturation of the pump and its rate change with the square of the calcium concen-
tration in the cytosol, i.e. Hill coeﬃcient n = 2 (3). As shown in the “Pumping activity”
section, we can conﬁrm this observation and also use Hill coeﬃcient n = 2 (equation 24).
However we have only found evidence in literature for a Ca2+:ATP stoichiometry of 1:1
for the PMCA pump (1, 3, 7). As a possible explanation Carafoli describes a separation
of the binding and the transduction of the calcium ions. The pump could bind two Ca2+
ions with high aﬃnity but the transport step can involve only one calcium ion.

Our aim to characterize pump isoforms by diﬀerent universal parameter sets is achieved
for the investigated h2b and h4b isoforms. We assumed the same way of function for all
isoforms, hence these parameter express relevant diﬀerences in stimulation and pumping
behavior. With the concept of providing universal parameter sets we claim for the sets
to be applicable to other system simulations including hPMCA2b or hPMCA4b isoforms.
Figure 5 shows an accurate prediction calculated out of the universal parameter of the h4b
isoform. Concerning the calcium pumping rates Jmax and J ∗
max, by using the expression
level and the overall average protein mass we calculated single pump turnover rates. Based
on a measurement of Elwess et al.
in 1997 (15) we computed with the same approach
but an accordant expression level of 0.2 % a turnover rate of 8.5 Hz for the rPMCA2b
pump. Our calculated single turnover rates (table 3) are of the same range as those of
Blaustein who indicated a turnover of ≈ 30 Hz without specifying the isoform ((4) and
private communication).

Therewith the isoform characteristic universal set of parameter may be applied to dif-
ferent scenarios by incorporating the system speciﬁc expression level of PMCA proteins.
However alterations of the stimulation rate constants may occur under modiﬁed experi-
mental conditions. Since we consider proteins with polar binding cites we cannot exclude
a change of dynamical properties at diﬀerent ionic strengths of the experimental solutions.
Corresponding experiments could elucidate the importance of such eﬀects and also ver-
ify our theoretical predictions about the calmodulin dependence of the stimulation and
relaxation constant.

We study analytically the steady-state regime of a net-
work of n error-prone self-replicating templates forming an
asymmetric hypercycle and its error tail. We show that the
existence of a master template with a higher non-catalyzed
self-replicative productivity, a, than the error tail ensures the
stability of chains in which m < n − 1 templates coexist with
the master species. The stability of these chains against the
error tail is guaranteed for catalytic coupling strengths (K)
of order of a. We ﬁnd that the hypercycle becomes more sta-
ble than the chains only for K of order of a2. Furthermore,
we show that the minimal replication accuracy per template
needed to maintain the hypercycle, the so-called error thresh-
old, vanishes like

n/K for large K and n ≤ 4.

I. INTRODUCTION

The limitation of the length of a genome by the repli-
cation accuracy per nucleotide (q) has led to a deadlock
in the theories of the origin of life based on the evolution
of competing self-replicating polynucleotides. According
to Eigen’s quasispecies model [1,2], which may serve as
a paradigm here, polynucleotides have to replicate with
high accuracy in order to reach a certain length, a re-
quirement that is impossible to fulﬁll without the aid
of specialized catalysts. However, to build those cata-
lysts a blueprint is necessary that amounts to a large
genome (the nucleotide sequence), which itself cannot
be maintained without the catalysts. In particular, for
polynucleotides of ﬁxed length L, the quasispecies model
predicts the existence of a minimal replication accuracy
per genome Qc = qL
c , below which the genetic informa-
tion is irreversibly lost. This information crisis has been
termed error threshold transition. Above Qc the popula-
tion is composed of a master copy together with a cloud of
structurally similar mutants (quasispecies) [1,2]. Equally
important is the ﬁnding that, except in a trivially degen-
erate case, two or more quasispecies cannot coexist [3],
thus precluding the coexistence of templates (i.e. polynu-
cleotides) suﬃciently diﬀerent from each other to code for
any useful set of catalysts. Although it has been claimed
that the information crisis is not really a fundamental
issue, since the error threshold transition appears only in

some pathological, discontinuous replication landscapes
[4], the coexistence problem seems to be more pervasive,
as it is associated to the form of the growth functions in
the chemical kinetics equations [5,6].

In order to circumvent the aforementioned limitations
of the quasispecies model, Eigen and Schuster proposed
the hypercycle [7], that is, a catalytic feedback network
whereby each template helps in the replication of the next
one, in a regulatory cycle closing on itself. This model
has gain plausibility when the ability of polynucleotides
to help propagate each other was established experimen-
tally through the study of the catalytic activity of the
RNA (ribozymes) [8,9]. Interestingly, though the error
threshold phenomenon has traditionally been considered
the main motivation for the proposal of the hypercycle
(see [10], for instance), most of the seminal works in this
ﬁeld have dealt with the coexistence issue only, as they
assume perfect replication accuracy for the hypercycle
elements [7,11]. In this case an arbitrary number of tem-
plates permanently coexist in a dynamical equilibrium
state; if n > 4, however, the template concentrations
vary with time [7], periodically decreasing to very small
values. In practice, large hypercycles are therefore sus-
ceptible to extinction via ﬂuctuations, see e.g. [12], hence
the information gain due to the coexistence of diﬀerent
templates in the hypercycle may not be very impressive
after all. Furthermore, we will argue in this paper that
coexistence in the absence of a stable equilibrium can
also be achieved by a simpler arrangement, namely, the
free chains, in which the cyclic order of the catalysts is
interrupted.

The eﬀect of error-prone replication (mutation) in the
hypercyclic organization was investigated by introducing
a mutation ﬁeld as a perturbation of the error-free ki-
netic equations [13]. This approach, however, is not very
appropriate to study the error threshold phenomenon,
since the results obtained cannot be easily compared with
those of the quasispecies model. In this sense, a better
approach is to assume the existence of a special class of
templates with no catalytic activity, so-called error-tail,
that appear as a consequence of the replication errors of
the hypercycle elements [14–16]. However, the particu-
lar catalytic network investigated extensively within that
framework was not the hypercycle, except for a short dis-
cussion in [17], but the fully connected network in which
each element helps the replication of all other elements

1

of the network [15,16]. (Clearly, in the case of n = 2 ele-
ments, these two networks become identical [14].) Such a
network is more robust than the hypercycle since the mal-
functioning or extinction of one of its elements does not
compromise the whole network. Nevertheless, besides its
aesthetic appeal, the cyclic coupling of the hypercycle
seems to be more realistic [9].

The goal of this paper is to investigate analytically the
steady-states of a deterministic system comprised of two
parts, namely, a hypercycle made up of n self-replicating
templates I1, I2, . . . , In and its error tail Ie. These parts
are coupled such that any erroneous copy of the hyper-
cycle elements will belong to the error tail. The focus of
the present analysis is on the location in the parameters
space of the model (i.e.
replication accuracy per tem-
plate, non-catalyzed and catalyzed productivity values,
and hypercycle size) of the regions of stability of the di-
verse possibilities of coexistence between the templates
composing the hypercycle. In particular, we give empha-
sis to the characterization of the critical parameters at
which the hypercycle becomes unstable against the error
tail.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Sec. II we present the chemical kinetics equations that
govern the time evolution of the system and motivate
the speciﬁc choice of the parameters used throughout the
paper. The ﬁxed-points of the kinetic equations are ob-
tained analytically in Sec. III and their stability discussed
in Sec. IV. The phase-diagrams showing the regions of
stability of the diverse coexistence states are presented
and analyzed in Sec. V. Finally, some concluding re-
marks are presented in Sec. VI.

II. THE MODEL

We consider a system composed of a hypercycle made
up of n elements I1, . . . , In and its error tail Ie, as il-
lustrated in Fig. 1.
In contrast to the so-called ele-
mentary hypercycle [7], we assume that the templates
are capable of self-replication with productivity values
Ai (i = 1, . . . , n) and Ae. Moreover, as usual, the growth
promotion of template Ii as a result of the catalysis from
template Ii−1 is measured by the kinetic constants Ki.
The key ingredient in the modeling is that in both pro-
cesses of growth of template Ii the probability of success
is given by the parameter Q
[0, 1], so that an erro-
neous copy, which will then belong to the error tail, is
produced with probability 1
Q. Hence the concentra-
tions xi (i = 1, . . . , n) of the hypercycle elements and the
concentration xe of the error-tail evolve in time according
to the kinetic equations

Clearly, this formulation is equivalent to considering
polynucleotides of length L
whose replication accu-
racy per nucleotide q goes to 1 such that the replication
accuracy per genome is ﬁnite, i.e.
In this
limit, the back-mutations from the error-tail elements to
the templates that compose the hypercycle, as well as
the mutations between those templates, can be safely ne-
glected. Hence, mutations can only increase the concen-
tration of the elements in the error-tail. The advantage
of working in this limit is that the error threshold transi-
tion can be precisely located by determining the value of
Q at which the concentration of a relevant template van-
ishes. For ﬁnite L, as well as for ﬁnite population sizes,
the characterization of this transition is more involved,
being achieved through the use of ﬁnite-size scaling tech-
niques [18].

In this work we consider the single-sharp-peak replica-
tion landscape [1,2], in which we ascribe the productiv-
ity value A1 = a > 1 to the so-called master template

I1 and Ai = Ae = 1 to the n
1 other elements of the
hypercycle as well as to the error-tail. Also, for the sake
of simplicity we set Ki = K for all i. The motivation
for this particular choice of parameters is the observa-
tion that the emergence of the hypercycle requires both
spatial and temporal coexistence of the templates form-
ing the network, and this can be achieved by a quasis-
pecies distribution, which guarantees the coexistence of
the master template and its close mutants, despite the
purely competitive character of the quasispecies model
[19]. Once the coexistence is established, the appear-
ance of catalytic couplings between the templates is not
a very unlike event. Of course, as soon as those cooper-
ative couplings become suﬃciently strong to balance the
competition imposed by the constant concentration con-
straint, the mutants will certainly depart from the master
template due to the relentless pressure of the mutations,
so that no trace will remain of the original quasispecies
distribution.

III. FIXED POINTS

Let us distinguish between surviving templates xi >
0 and extinct templates xi = 0. A survivor Ij is said
isolated if xj−1 = xj+1 = 0. Hence,

In the steady-state regime, Eq. (5) yields Φ = Q which,
for Q < 1, is incompatible with Eq. (6), since the term
within brackets in this equation is positive. Therefore, all
isolated survivors with the exception of the master tem-
plate are unstable against the error tail. Next consider
the following chain of surviving templates:

0, i.e., xi = 0. So, there is no ﬁxed point corresponding
to such a chain. Any chain of survivors therefore must
start with template n or 1. In the ﬁrst case we get Φ = Q
from ˙xn = 0 and aQ + KQxn = Q from ˙x1 = 0, yielding
xn = (1
a)/K < 0, which rules out this possibility.
The equilibria of interest for our study thus are either
the interior equilibrium in which all templates survive,
or a ﬁxed point that corresponds to a chain of survivors
beginning with I1.

−

Accordingly, we deﬁne a m-coexistence state as the n-
component template vector x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) in which
the ﬁrst m components are strictly positive and the rest
are equal to zero. Clearly, given the template vector x
the concentration of the error tail xe is determined by the
constraint (4). In the following we solve analytically the
kinetic equations in the steady-state regime ˙xi = 0

i.

The simplest ﬁxed point is the zero-coexistence state
(m = 0) which corresponds to the solution x1 = . . . =
xn = 0 and xe = 1, existing for the complete range of
parameter values.

In the case of chains, i.e. 0 < m < n, the steady-state
solutions of Eqns. (1) and (2) are straightforward. In
fact, since xn = 0 by deﬁnition, we get Φ = aQ from
˙x1 = 0 which then yields

We note that the 1-coexistence state (quasispecies) is

tion, namely K > a
1, is derived by considering the
other templates in the chain. In fact, this very simple
result quantiﬁes nicely the notion that the cooperative
couplings must reach a certain minimum strength so as
to balance the competition between templates.

IV. STABILITY ANALYSIS

In order to perform a standard linear stability analysis
of the ﬁxed points obtained in the previous section, it is
convenient to rewrite the kinetic equations (1) and (2) as
follows

(17)

˙xi = xiFi (x)

i = 1, . . . , n

(19)

where

Fi(x) = AiQ + KQxi−1

and we have used the constraint (4) to eliminate xe. The
stability of a ﬁxed point is ensured provided that the
real parts of all eigenvalues of the n
are
negative. In our case the elements of the Jacobian are
given by

n Jacobian

The evaluation of the eigenvalues is simple only for the
zero-coexistence state, since in this case the Jacobian is
diagonal with elements J11 = aQ
1, i >
1. Therefore this steady state becomes unstable for
Q > 1/a, which coincides with the lowest replication
accuracy required for the existence of the 1-coexistence
state. However, for a general m-coexistence state we have
to resort to a numerical evaluation of the Jacobian eigen-
values.

Fortunately, in the case of chains 0 < m < n there is an
alternative way to look at the stability of the ﬁxed points,

state, which becomes unstable due to the emergence of

which makes the concentration xm+1 non-zero will be
ampliﬁed if Am+1Q + KQxm
Φ is positive. For m > 0
we use Φ = aQ and Am+1 = 1 together with the value of
xm given in Eq. (13) to obtain the following (necessary)
condition for the stability of the m-coexistence state,

−

Q < Qm+1 m > 0,

(22)

with Qm given in Eq. (14). Hence the maximum value
of Q allowed for the stability of the m-coexistence state
coincides with the minimum Q required for the existence
Interestingly, though
of the (m + 1)-coexistence state.
for m = 0 we have Φ = 1, A1 = a and x0 = 0, condition
(22) holds true in this case too.

At this point two caveats are in order. First, the entire
argument leading to the stability condition (22) is ﬂawed
if the (m + 1)-coexistence state happens to be unstable.
Therefore, we must guarantee via the numerical evalu-
ation of the Jacobian eigenvalues that the l-coexistence

4

state is stable before using that condition to study the
stability of chains with m < l.
In particular, we have
carried out the numerical analysis for the hypercycle so-
lution l = n and found the following general results:

(i) For n

4, it is always stable;

≤

≥

(ii) for n = 5, it is stable in a very small range of Q

above Q5; and

(iii) for n

6, it is always unstable.

Second, the derivation of the stability condition (22) is
based on the analysis of a single eigenvalue of the Jaco-
bian and so it does not yield a suﬃcient condition for
the stability of the ﬁxed points. Nevertheless, we have
veriﬁed through the numerical evaluation of all n eigen-
values that, provided the (m+ 1)-coexistence state is sta-
ble, the eigenvalue associated to ﬂuctuations leading to
an increase of the chain length is the ﬁrst one to become
positive.

V. DISCUSSION

Combining the existence and the stability results de-
rived in the previous sections we can draw the phase-
diagrams in the plane (K, Q) for ﬁxed a and n. In par-
ticular, for n
4 the m-coexistence state is stable within
the interval

≤

Qm < Q < Qm+1 m < n

(23)

with Qm given in Eq. (14), provided that K > a
1.
Interestingly, for ﬁxed Q, Eq. (23) shows that the incre-
ment δK in the catalytic coupling needed to incorporate
a new template into the chain is

regardless the number of elements in the chain. The case
K < a
1, for which no chains with m > 1 are allowed,
does not require any special consideration. In fact, we
ﬁnd that the only stable states are the zero-coexistence
Q
(Q < 1/a) and the 1-coexistence (1/a
1) states.
However, since Q2

consistent with Eq. (23).

Beyond this value the error threshold of the hypercycle
Qh is smaller than that of the quasispecies. Moreover, as
mentioned before, for large K, it vanishes like 1/√K. A
rather frustrating aspect of Kh and Kc is that both are of
order a2, indicating then that the productivity of catalyt-
ically assisted self-replication is much larger than that
of non-catalyzed self-replication. While this is obviously
true for biochemical catalysis, it is diﬃcult to argue for
the existence of such eﬃcient catalysts in prebiotic con-
ditions. On the other hand, we can take a diﬀerent, more
optimistic viewpoint and argue that modern biochemical
catalysts (enzymes) are so eﬃcient because their precur-
sors had to satisfy the stringent conditions imposed by
surpassing Kh.

In Fig. 3 we present the phase-diagram for n = 5. The
main diﬀerence from the previous ﬁgure is that the 5-
coexistence state is stable only within the thin region be-
tween Q5 and the dashed curve, obtained through the nu-
merical evaluation of the Jacobian eigenvalues. As these
curves intersect at some K

percycle is not very interesting, since it has the same

this result we have carried out the numerical integra-
tion of the kinetic equations using the ninetieth-order
Runge-Kutta method. The results are shown in Fig. 4,
which illustrates the time evolution of the concentrations
xi (i = 1, . . . , 5) inside and outside the region of stability.
Although the behavior pattern in the region of instabil-
ity seems periodic, we have not explored completely the
space of parameters to discard the existence of chaotic
behavior. Hence we use the term complex dynamics to
label this region in Fig. 3. We note that the phase-
diagram shown in this ﬁgure describes also the regions
5, since
of stability of hypercycles and chains of size n
m-coexistence states with m > 5 are always unstable.

An interesting limiting case which deserves special at-
tention is the symmetric hypercycle (a = 1). According
to the argument put forward in the beginning of Sec. III,
the only ﬁxed points in this case are the zero-coexistence
state and the hypercycle, i.e., chains are not allowed.
Moreover, Eq. (15) yields x1 = x2 = . . . = xn where x1
is given by Eq. (16) with a replaced by 1. The analysis
of the roots of that quadratic equation and the numeri-
cal evaluation of the Jacobian eigenvalues yield that the
symmetric hypercycle is stable for

in the symmetric case a = 1, so it must be a conse-
quence of the asymmetry in the productivity values of
the non-catalyzed self-replication reaction. We note that,
diﬀerently from the asymmetric case (a > 1), the zero-
coexistence state is always stable.

For the sake of completeness, we present some results
on the elementary hypercycle (Ai = 0, i = 1, . . . , n) cou-
pled to an error tail (Ae = 1) via the imperfect catalyti-
cally assisted self-replication. Inserting these parameters
into Eq. (20) and setting Fi = 0

the hypercycle (Qh) becomes smaller than that of the
quasispecies (Q1 = 1/a) for catalytic couplings (K) of
order of a2, where a is the productivity value of the mas-
n/K for
ter template. In particular, Qh vanishes like
large K. Perhaps, even more important is our ﬁnding
that the asymmetry in the non-catalyzed self-replication
reaction (a > 1) entails the existence of chains of size
n
5. We note that these chains are unstable in the
symmetric hypercycle as well as in the fully connected
network [15,16].

Adding to the scenario for the emergence of the hyper-
cycle described in Sec. II, which starts with an isolated
quasispecies, our results indicate that the chains may well
be the next step in this complex evolutionary process. In
fact, according to Eq. (24) the strengths of the catalytic
couplings needed to form a chain are of order a, while the
hypercycle only acquires its desirable stability character-
istics for strengths of order a2 (see Eq. (18)). Although
we realize that an evolutionary step leading from chains
to hypercycles is still a major one, it is certainly much
more plausible than a direct transition from quasispecies
to hypercycle. In any event, we think that the emergence
of the hypercycle can be explained as a series of plausible
smooth transitions, without need to postulating the hy-
percycle as an unique event in prebiotic evolution. In this
vein, this work represents a modest ﬁrst step to tackle
this fundamental problem within a ﬁrm basis.

To conclude we must mention an alternative resolution
for the information crisis in prebiotic evolution which
has received some attention recently [21], namely, the
stochastic corrector model [22]. This model builds on
ideas of the classical group selection theory for the evo-
lution of altruism [23], since it considers replicative tem-
plates competing inside replicative compartments, whose
selective values depend on their template composition.
However, the chemical kinetics equations governing the
dynamics of the templates inside the compartments dis-
play a non-physical (non-integer exponents) dependence
of growth on template concentrations. It seems to us that
this basic assumption of the stochastic corrector model
must be relaxed, or at least justiﬁed, before it can be con-
sidered an important alternative to the more traditional
approach based on the hypercycle and its variants.

Before concluding this section, we must note that the
chains of size m considered hitherto are bonded in a hy-
percycle of size n > m. We could study free chains of
size n as well by simply setting x0 = 0 in the kinetic
equations (1) and (2). Not surprisingly, the results are
essentially the same as for bonded chains, with Qm play-
ing a similar fundamental role in delimiting the regions of
stability of the shorter chains (m < n). Although a full
discussion of the stability of the complete chain (m = n)
is beyond the scope of this paper, we point out that free
chains with n > 4 are always unstable. Moreover, as il-
lustrated in Fig. 5, the oscillatory behavior pattern of the
template concentrations, which ensues a dynamic coexis-
tence among all templates in the chain, is similar to that
observed in the hypercycle (compare with Fig. 4). In this
sense, the free chains seem as good as the hypercycle to
attain that kind of coexistence. However, we must em-
phasize that, for suﬃciently large K (i.e. K > Kh), the
ﬁxed points describing the coexistence of n
4 templates
in a hypercycle are much more robust against replication
errors than their counterparts in the free chains.

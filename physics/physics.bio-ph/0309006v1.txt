Statistical analysis of distributions of occurrence frequencies of short words in 108 microbial
complete genomes reveals the existence of a set of universal ”root-sequence lengths” shared by all
microbial genomes. These lengths and their universality give powerful clues to the way microbial
genomes are grown. We show that the observed genomic properties are explained by a model for
genome growth in which primitive genomes grew mainly by maximally stochastic duplications of
short segments from an initial length of about 200 nucleotides (nt) to a length of about one million nt
typical of microbial genomes. The relevance of the result of this study to the nature of simultaneous
random growth and information acquisition by genomes, to the so-called RNA world in which life
evolved before the rise of proteins and enzymes and to several other topics are discussed.

Genomes are books of life for organisms and necessarily
carry huge amounts of information. By and large bigger
genomes carry more information than smaller ones (there
are noted exceptions). Yet as far as we know genomes
grew and evolved stochastically, modulated by natural
selection [1]. This raises a puzzling question: how does
genomes grow stochastically and simultaneously accumu-
late information? This paper uses the set of all 108 se-
quenced complete microbial genomes as data in exploring
ideas on randomness, entropy, information and growth
with the aim of ﬁnding an answer. What emerges is the
discovery of a set of universal “root-sequence lengths”
governed by a simple exponential relation shared by all
the microbial genomes and a model for genome growth
that reproduces observed genomic data and that serves
as at least a partial answer: genomes are “quasirepli-
cas”grown mainly by maximally stochastic short segmen-
tal duplications from random root-sequences of a univer-
sal length of about 200 nt.

In what follows we do some groundwork by ﬁrst dis-
cussing the relation between the relative spectral width
of a distribution of occurrence frequencies for a set of
random events and the size of the set, and the same for
the set where all frequencies are multiplied by a factor,
and then showing a simple relation between the spectral
width and the Shannon information for such sets. We
then examine certain statistical properties of complete
microbial genomes, present the results and analyze them
by way of our growth model.

Consider a set of occurrence frequencies for τ types of
τ
i=1fi=N } ≡ {fi|N }, with mean frequency
events, {fi| P
¯f and standard deviation (std) ∆=h(f − ¯f )2i
. If each
frequency is increased by a factor of m then ¯f and std for
the new set {f ′
i = mfi|mN }, an m-multiple of {fi|N },

1/2

will both increase by a factor of m so that the relative
spectral width, σ ≡ ∆/ ¯f , will not change.

Suppose {fi|N } is a set of frequencies of random events
of equal likelihood. Then the event probability versus
frequency will be nearly a Poisson distribution (provided
N >>τ ) and std ∆ran= (b ¯f )1/2, where b<1 is a factor
depending only on τ and approaches unity when τ is
large. That σ scales as N −1/2 for large N is the basis
for a well known eﬀect in thermodynamics: the average
of some measure of a random system gains sharpness as
the system gains size, and achieves inﬁnite sharpness in
the thermodynamical (large N ) limit.

Let {fi|N } be the frequency set for a “small” system
SS of random events, {f ′′
i |mN } be the set for a “large”
system SL of random events, and {f ′
i = mfi|mN }, the m-
multiple of SS, be the set for the system S′. By deﬁnition
both SS and SL are totally random while S′ is only par-
tially so. We have m ¯f = ¯f ′ = ¯f ′′ and σ = σ′ = m1/2σ′′;
S′ has the large size of SL and the large σ of SS. Com-
pared to SS, S′ has the randomness of SS, but repeated
m times. Compared to SL, S′ is less random and more
ordered by possessing a periodicity.

Shannon expressed the information in a system in
terms of decrease in uncertainty [2].
Shannon’s un-
certainty, or entropy, for the system {fi|N } is H =
− Pi(fi/N ) log(fi/N ). We deﬁne the information of the
system as R ≡ Hmax − H, which accords with the ther-
modynamical notion that an increase in entropy results
in a decrease in information. We are interested in cases
when most of the fi’s are non-zero, then H acquires its
maximum value log τ when all fi = ¯f and one ﬁnds for a
bell-shaped distribution

R ≡ log τ − H = Cσ2 + O (cid:0)σ3

(cid:1) ≈ Cσ2

(1)

where the proportional coeﬃcient C is about 0.5; it is

exactly 0.5 if {fi|N } has a Gaussian distribution. This
reveals the close relation between information and rela-
tive spectral width. For the three systems SS, S′ and
SL discussed above, R(SS) = R(S′) ≈ Cσ2 ≈ mR(SL).
That is, the partially ordered system S′ has the size of
the larger system SL and the higher information content
of smaller system SS. Summarizing, we have: (i) Given
two totally random systems the larger system carries less
information; (ii) Given two systems of the same size the
one with the larger σ has more order and carries more
information. We should note that since they are simply
“periodic”, m-multiples do not represent the best route
by which a system grows and acquires information. In
general, a large R or σ is a necessary but not suﬃcient
condition for high information content. In what follows,
pending a veriﬁcation of Eq. (1), we shall use the terms
information and relative spectral width interchangeably.
Consider now single strands of DNA, or nucleotide se-
quences and view them as linear texts written in the four
bases, or letters, A, C, G, T [3, 4]. For a sequence of
L nucleotides (nt) we denote by Sk, or a k-distribution,
the set of frequencies {fi|L}k, where fi is the occurrence
frequency of the ith k-letter word, or k-mer, that may be
obtained by moving a sliding window of width k across
the genome; τ =4k and ¯f =4−kL. To measure the in-
formation of a real genomic sequence relative to those
expected of a random sequence of the same length (and
base composition, see below) we deﬁne “relative spectral
information” for bell-shaped distributions to be:

Mσ ≡ σ2 ¯f /b ≈ (σ/σran)2

(2)

where b is the factor associated with σran. A random
sequence is expected to have Mσ≈1.

Suppose Q, an m-replica, is obtained by replicating m
times a sequence Q′, then every k-distribution Sk of Q
is an m-multiple of the corresponding k-distribution of
Q′. In particular, if Q′ is a random sequence, then we
expect (when m<<L) Mσ(Sk) = m to a high degree of
accuracy, independent of k. This motivates the follow-
ing: Given sequence Q of length L and k-distribution Sk,
Lr ≡ L/Mσ(Sk) is deﬁned as the root-sequence length
of Q for k-mers. For as far as k-mers are concerned, Q
(not necessarily an m-replica) has the same relative spec-
tral information as that of a random “root-sequence” of
length Lr. Only an m-replica of a random sequence is ex-
pected to have Lr’s independent of k for k < log L/ log 4.
The 108 complete microbial genomes currently in the
GenBank [5] are heterogeneous in length - 0.4 to 7 million
bases (Mb) - and base composition - 20 to 80% A+T. In
most cases the numbers of A’s and T’s (and of C’s and
G’s) in a genome are very similar. We therefore char-
acterize the base composition of a genomes by a single
parameter p, the combined probability of A and T, or C
and G, whichever is greater.

In Fig. 1 the 5-distributions (green/gray curves) of ran-
dom sequences 2 Mnt long with p equal to 0.5 (A), 0.6
(B) and 0.7 (C), respectively, are shown together with the
per 2 Mnt 5-distributions (black) of three genomes with

2

matching p values: A. fulgidus [6] (A), S. pneumoniae [7]
(B) and C. acetobutylicum [8] (C). Only the distributions
in (A) for the p = 0.5 sequences satisfy the bell-shape re-
quirement to make Eq.(1) directly applicable. In this case
the random distribution is indeed Poissonian and the ge-
nomic distribution is much wider, σA.ful./σran ∼ 20 so
that information-wise, as far as 5-mers are concerned, a
2 Mnt stretch of the A. fulgidus genome is like the 400-
replica of a random sequence merely 5 knt long.

Comparison of 5-distributions of genome (black),
FIG. 1:
random (green) and model (orange) sequences with p=0.5
(A), 0.6 (B) and 0.7 (C), respectively. The genomes are A.
fulgidus (A), S. pneumoniae (B) and C. acetobutylicum(C).

For random sequences with p > 0.5 the single Poisson
distribution is split into k + 1 smaller Poisson distribu-
tions (Fig. 1 (B) and (C)), one for each of the subsets
of k-mers with m AT’s (called m-sets), whose respective
means are ¯fm(p) = ¯f 2kpm(1 − p)k−m, m= 0 to k. For
the genomes the distributions for the m-sets are so broad-
ened that no individual peak is discernable. Notably in
cases when p > 0.5, the σ for the whole distribution is
mostly determined by the spread of the ¯fm’s, which gives
− 1]1/2, rather than by the infor-
σ ≈ [2k
mation of the sequence. We thus generalize the deﬁnition
for Mσ given in Eq.(2) to be the weighted average over
the relative spectral information of the m-sets:

Mσ ≡ X

L

(cid:0)2k(k, m) ¯fm(cid:1) σ2

¯fm/b

(3)

where (k, m) is a binomial, Pm 2k(k, m) ¯fm = L. Since
A and T (and C and G) are counted together and the
number of each monomer in the sequence is ﬁxed, the
binomial factor is taken to be b = 1 − 21−k. In practice,
to circumvent large ﬂuctuations in σk,m induced by small
unevenness in the A/T (or C/G) contents - this can occur
when ¯fm is very large at k=2 and 3 - each frequency
is divided by a factor (2k/pm(1 − p)k−m) Qs pms
, where
s runs over the four bases and Ps ms = k. To verify
Eq. (1), we also deﬁne a “relative Shannon information”
MR where σ2

k,m in Eq. (3) is replaced by Rk,m.
Fig. 2 shows log-log plots of Mσ and MR versus se-
quence length L computed from a “genome” set com-
posed of 108 complete microbial genomes [5] and two

s

control sets with lengths and base compositions match-
ing those in the genome set: a “random” set of ran-
dom sequences and a “replica” set of 100-replicas of
random sequences. The results for the control sets are
shown in the left-panel ((A) and (B)) of Fig. 2 and they
are essentially independent of k, sequence length L and
base composition p and have the expected values: (A)
MR = C = 0.514±0.062 - this veriﬁes Eq (1); (B)
Mσ = 1.02±0.11 for the random set and Mσ = 101±12
for the replica set. Each set contains 972 pieces of data
and in each plot about 50% of the error comes from data
for k=2 (“(cid:3)” in the ﬁgure) and 25% from k=3 (“△”).
This is because ¯fk,m for these cases are very large and
magnify ﬂuctuations in σk,m in Eq (3).

spectral information (Mσ) for three sets of sequences. (A)
MR for the random set; (B) Mσ for the random and replicas
sets; (C) Mσ for the genome set.

The right-panel of Fig. 2 shows Mσ for the genome
set, where each piece of data was multiplied by a factor of
210−k to delineate data into diﬀerent k groups for better
viewing. Still essentially p-independent, the data are oth-
erwise entirely diﬀerent from those of the control sets: (i)
For given k they form a band (std is about 50% of mean)
that depends linearly on L, implying that Lr = L/hMRi
is a universal root-sequence length, i.e., the same for all
microbial genomes. (ii) For given L, the mean log MR
decreases approximately linearly with increasing k, such
that the universal lengths (squares in Fig. 3) satisfy an
approximate exponential relation of the form

Lr(k) = Λ × tk;

2 ≤ k ≤ 10

(4)

with Λ = 48 ± 24 nt and t = 2.53. We remark that
the property revealed by the log-log plot in Fig. 2 (C)
is diﬀerent from Zipf’s law [9] and its variants that have
been much discussed for k-mer frequencies (k ≥ 6) in
biological sequences [3, 10].

The universality of the Lr’s suggests the existence of a
universal mechanism for (microbial) genome growth from
proto-genomes of a universal initial length. The very

mation of the genome set (squares) and a set of 108 model
sequences (triangles) whose lengths and base compositions
match those in the genome set. Line shows mean of Eq. (4).

large values of Mσ (hence the shortness of the Lr’s) for
the smaller k’s imply a mechanism involving a great deal
of replication or duplication. One obvious mechanism,
growth mainly by whole-genome replications [11, 12] is
ruled out because that would yield k-independent Lr’s,
contrary to data. The observed strong k-dependence of
Lr suggests a more complex duplication process.

We show that “universal genomes” generated in a sim-
ple and biologically plausible growth model [13, 14] pos-
sess properties similar to those of microbial genomes. In
the model the initial condition of a genome is a random
sequence about L0 ≈ 200 nt long with a base compo-
sition characterized by a given value of p. The condi-
tion L0 < Lr(2) ≈ 300 nt is necessary if the large val-
ues of Mσ for the small k’s are to be attained. The
genomes then grows by random short segmental duplica-
tions - or quasireplication - possibly modulated by ran-
dom single mutations. The model shares some features
with those used to explain the power-law behavior of the
occurrence frequency of genes in genomes [15, 16], ex-
cept that there the units of duplication are genes, not
the short oligonucleotides used here. The quasireplica-
tion process is maximally stochastic: a segment of length
l, chosen according to the probability density function
f (l) = 1/(an!)(l/a)ne−l/a, is copied from one site and
inserted into another site, both randomly selected. The
Erlang function, the integer n=2 and the length scale
a=6.7 (nt) were determined by data, implying a typical
length of 20 ± 12 nt for the duplicated segments.

In Fig. 3 the Lr’s (triangles) extracted from a set of
108 model sequences with length and base composition
matching those in the genome set and generated in sil-
ico by quasireplication are compared with the Lr’s for
the genome set (squares). The two sets of lengths es-
sentially agree although those from the model sequences
have a slightly weaker k-dependence. The k-distributions
of 5-mers computed from three representative model se-
quences with p= 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7, respectively, are shown
as orange curves in Fig. 1. These results show that our
very simple growth model, in being able to produce se-
quences that faithfully exhibit signature global properties
of microbial genomes, likely has captured the essence of
the real genomic growth process. We believe that with-

out the two main ingredients of our model, very short
initial genome length (. 200 nt) and random duplication
of short segments, no simple growth model can produce
the results shown in Fig. 3.

We call sequences generated in our model quasireplicas.
Unlike an m-replica, a quasireplica is globally aperiodic.
If the length of a quasireplica is L, then the maximum k
for which Eq. (4) applies is given by kmax ≈ log L/ log 4.
For k ≤ kmax a quasireplica acts as an m-replica where
m = L/Lr(k), while for k >> kmax it appears essen-
tially as a random sequence. Quasireplicas are partially
ordered, highly complex and evidently capable of car-
rying large amounts of information. Our study shows
that microbial genomes are self-organized quasireplicas
belonging to the class given by Λ ≈ 48 nt and t ≈ 2.53 of
Eq. (4). It is a common feature of complex self-organized
systems to exhibit power-law relations [17] and the rela-
tion between our model and Eq. (4) is being explored.

Quasireplicas are extremely robust. We have veriﬁed
that, provided the typical duplicated segment length is
signiﬁcantly greater than kmax, quasireplication (includ-
ing simple replication) of a quasireplica begets a longer
quasireplica of the same class. We are currently studying
eukaryotic genomes in terms of quasireplicas and results
will be reported elsewhere. Based on ﬁndings obtained
so far we make the following proposition: the ancestors
of microbial genomes underwent a fundamental transi-
tion in their growth and evolution shortly after they had
reached a length of about 200 nt, by which time they had
acquired a rudimentary duplication machinery, and then
grew (and diverged) mainly by short-segment quasirepli-
cation to become quasireplicas of the order of 1 Mnt long.
Assuming this proposition to be substantially true we
mention some implications.

It seems that by adopting the natural method of
quasireplication for growth, microbial genomes also
adopted a superb strategy for information acquisition
and accumulation, and in doing so they left a clear evolu-

4

tionary track: the universal root-sequence lengths. This
seems to put the onset of quasireplication in the posi-
tion of being another, hitherto unknown, major tran-
sition in evolution [18]. Before that transition the an-
cestral genomes and their prebiotic precursors somehow
acquired a store of information - including a rudimen-
tary duplication machinery - and after the transition the
genomes evolved via quasireplication. The smallness of
the genomes at the transition - less than a quarter of the
size of a present-day gene coding for a typical enzyme -
implies that at the time they must have lived in an “RNA
world” devoid of proteins [19, 20]. It is likely that the ri-
bozymes that made up the duplication machinery at that
time were not much bigger than the smallest ribozymes
now extant, about 31 to 50 nt [21]; hence the average du-
plicated segment length of about 20 nt would have been
eﬀective in propagating coded information which, pre-
sumably, could later be locally varied under the combined
forces of mutation and natural selection for adaptation
to new purposes. An RNA world reigned no more than
600 million years, from about 4.2 (when the earth cooled
down) to 3.6 (when protein must have appeared) billion
years ago - probably even much shorter [20].
It is not
necessary that genomes grew to their respective current
lengths during that period.
It is suﬃcient that during
that period, growth by short segmental quasireplication
produced basic quasireplicas which, after the rise of pro-
teins and enzymes, could be further expanded upon via
quasireplication by duplicating longer segments, includ-
ing genes [15, 16]. Whatever path the genomes actually
took, their rate of evolution must have been tremendous
during the RNA era, and quasireplication probably had
a better chance of meeting that challenge than any other
alternative.

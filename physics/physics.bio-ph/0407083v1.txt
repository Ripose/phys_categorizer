We summarize and compare recent Molecular Dynamics simulations on the interactions of dipalmi-
toylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers in the liquid crystalline phase with a number of small
molecules including trehalose, a disaccharide of glucose, alcohols, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).
The sugar molecules tend to stabilize the structure of the bilayer as they bridge adjacent lipid head-
groups. They do not strongly change the structure of the bilayer. Alcohols and DMSO destabilize
the bilayer as they increase its area per molecule in the bilayer plane and decrease the order param-
eter. Alcohols have a stronger detrimental eﬀect than DMSO. The observables which we compare
are the area per molecule in the plane of the bilayer, the membrane thickness, and the NMR order
parameter of DPPC hydrocarbon tails. The area per molecule and the order parameter are very
well correlated whereas the bilayer thickness is not necessarily correlated with them.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Phospholipid bilayers have been the focus of research for a long time due to their natural occurrence in cellular
and intracellular membranes. Detailed computer simulations of phospholipid monolayers and bilayers have achieved
a high degree of sophistication over the last years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The structures of lipid bilayers in water
have been determined for a variety of phospholipids [4, 6, 11, 12] and the understanding of their structural features
has increased signiﬁcantly. More recently computational studies of mixtures of various phospholipids [12, 13, 14, 15]
and of phospholipids with cholesterol [16, 17, 18, 19] have also been reported. However, the question how such lipid
bilayer membranes interact with small molecules has to date not gained very much attention except for a few initial
studies on alcohols [20, 21, 22], sugars [23, 24], and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) [25, 26]. The inﬂuence of lipophilic
polymers on lipid bilayers has also been studied [27].

If we want to understand the interactions of cells with their environment, we ﬁrst have to understand the interaction
of cell membranes – or phospholipid bilayers as model systems – with molecules typical in cell environments. Cell
membranes are the ﬁrst part of the cell to come into contact with any nutrient, pathogen, or other molecule in
the environment. So the understanding of membrane interaction with small molecules is of tremendous biological
importance.

In this contribution we compare the structural inﬂuences of diﬀerent small molecules on model lipid membranes.
We are focusing on molecules with high biological relevance. These include trehalose, alcohols and dimethylsulfoxide.
Sugar molecules are obviously nutrients to living organisms and some sugars are also known to be cryo–protectants [28,
29, 30]. In particular, trehalose, which is a disaccharide of glucose has been found to be very eﬀective in this respect.
It has been pointed out that trehalose is able to form only one internal hydrogen bond in contrast to, e.g., sucrose
which forms two [31]. This leaves trehalose more susceptible to hydrogen bonding with lipids. Recently, it has been
shown that the molecular mechanism underlying this cryo–protective eﬀect is the hydrogen bonding pattern of the

trehalose molecules to the bilayer headgroups [23]. The sugar can “substitute” some of the hydrogen bonds normally
provided by water and by that stabilize the fragile bilayer arrangement. Stabilization or destabilization here mean
that the bilayer is able to withstand harsher or less harsh conditions in presence of small molecules compared to the
pure bilayer in water. Trehalose is experimentally known to prevent the lipid from undergoing a phase transition
under cooling, i.e., it shifts the main phase transition temperature signiﬁcantly [32].

DMSO is known to have some cryo–protective properties as well [33], in addition to its anti-inﬂammatory, analgesic,
muscle relaxant, mast cell stimulation and collagen dissolution properties [34].
It has been reported that DMSO
strongly changes the overall bilayer structure by penetrating into the hydrocarbon layer to a much higher degree than
sugar or alcohol molecules [25].

It has been observed experimentally that alcohols have a destabilizing eﬀect on model membranes [35, 36].
It
has also been observed that upon addition of alcohols, the lipid bilayer becomes thinner and the area per molecule
increases. A related industrial question is the problem known as stuck fermentation in the wine industry [37, 38].
A stuck fermentation means that the yeast cells do not transform all the available sugar into alcohol but stop at an
incomplete stage. It has been proposed that the underlying mechanism is an alcohol–triggered structural transition in
the membrane which forces trans–membrane proteins to change conformation rendering them dysfunctional [37]. To
date, there is no predictive means to detect stuck fermentations. The ﬁrst approach to understand the mechanisms
leading to stuck fermentation is therefore to study the inﬂuence of alcohols on lipid bilayers as the direct eﬀect on the
proteins is expected to be only secondary.

II. SIMULATION DETAILS

In this contribution we focus on a comparison between small molecules and their eﬀect on the bilayer structure.
The details of the simulation models are presented elsewhere [21, 23, 25]. Let us summarize the main characteristics.
All simulations contain fully hydrated dipalmtoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers with 128 molecules, i.e., 64 per
leaﬂet (DPPC is one of the most abundant phospholipids in animal cell membranes). Our simulations are in atomistic
detail except for the hydrogen atoms bonded in methyl(ene) groups. These groups are collapsed into a united atom
description centered on the respective carbon. There are at least 3655 water molecules in the system (8958 water
molecules for some systems with alcohol). All simulations were performed at 325 K, a temperature at which DPPC
is in the biologically most relevant ﬂuid phase. Simulations of the pure bilayer, as well as bilayers with up to 3 wt%
methanol or ethanol, (lipid free basis, as we do not take the lipids into account for concentration calculations) have
been performed. Note that a weight concentration of 1.7 wt% methanol is the same molar concentration as 2.5 wt%
ethanol. In the case of trehalose the concentrations considered were up to 3 wt%, simulations at higher concentrations
and diﬀerent temperatures have been reported elsewhere [23, 24]. The DMSO systems contained 18.6 wt% DMSO.
Simulations were performed under constant temperature and constant pressure conditions using the Berendsen weak–
coupling scheme [39]. Simulations used a time-step of 1–2 fs. Figure 1 shows all the used molecules as well as a typical
bilayer conﬁguration.

It is worth noting that the exact simulation conditions can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the structural properties.
For example, changing the cutoﬀ for the nonbonded interactions can change the area per molecule by as much as
10 % [8]. Thus all direct comparisons have been performed under identical conditions with a cutoﬀ of the Lennard–
Jones interaction of 0.9 nm or 1.0 nm, respectively. The simulation models of the lipid alkyl tails used either the

3

NERD [40, 41, 42] or the GROMOS force-ﬁeld [43]; no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed between these two models
based on simulations of the pure bilayer system [8, 23]. This is not surprising as the two force–ﬁelds diﬀer only
slightly in their treatment of the hydrocarbon tails. The parameters for the head–groups are identical. However, if
we compare our areas per molecule to the data of Pereira et al. [24] who used a diﬀerent model, we see a diﬀerence
of about 10% for the pure DPPC bilayer and for the systems with trehalose. The models for the alcohols use either
the GROMOS forceﬁeld [43] or the model suggested by M¨uller-Plathe [44], small diﬀerences in the density proﬁles
were observed. The other observables discussed here were in all compared cases the same, a detailed comparison will
be published elsewhere [45]. Trehalose was modeled using the OPLS model [46], DMSO using the revised model by
Bordat et al. [47] and water using the SPC/E model [48].

Electrostatic interactions have been considered using the particle mesh Ewald technique [49]. A few simulations have
been performed using a reaction ﬁeld technique [50]. We compared the results from the simulations using the reaction
ﬁeld technique to the PME data for a representative subgroup and found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences. Simulations did
not contain any salt or other electrolytes.

We focus on three key observables to characterize the structure of the bilayer systems in contact with small molecules.
These are the area per molecule, the membrane thickness and the alkyl tail order parameter. The area per molecule
is simply deﬁned as the surface area in the xy plane (the membrane normal is the z direction) divided by the number
of molecules per leaﬂet. The membrane thickness is deﬁned as the distance between the peaks of highest density in a
mass density proﬁle, which roughly corresponds to the distance between the planes of the phosphorus atoms.

The order parameter is deﬁned in reference to NMR experiments by

cos Θα = ˆeαˆez,

Sαβ = h3 cos Θα cos Θβ − δαβi,

α, β = x, y, z

where ˆez is a unit vector in the laboratory z-direction and ˆeα is a unit vector in the local coordinate system of the tails,
which involves three connected carbons Ci−1,Ci, and Ci+1 and ~e = ~ri+1 −~ri−1. This order parameter characterizes the
alignment of the hydrocarbon tails with the bilayer normal. It can be used as one of the parameters (in addition to,
e.g., the area per molecule and the thickness) to characterize the thermodynamic phase of the system. All simulations
in this contribution are in the biologically most relevant ﬂuid phase. At a lower temperature the order of the tails
increases and this triggers a phase transition to the gel phase.

All these observables are experimentally accessible; the order parameter and the area per molecule can be measured
by NMR. The thickness can be measured experimentally by using electron density proﬁles from X-ray scattering [51].
However, especially under the inﬂuence of small molecules it is often inferred indirectly from the area per molecule
under the assumption of volume conservation in the bilayer [35].

III. BILAYER STRUCTURE AND INFLUENCE OF SMALL MOLECULES

At the temperature of 325 K we found the area per molecule to be 0.65 nm2 for a pure DPPC bilayer which lies
well within experimentally reported values of 0.55 nm2 to 0.71 nm2 [51, 52, 53, 54]. The alkyl tail order parameters
for the pure DPPC system, shown in Fig. 2, are also consistent with experimental data [55] and previous simulation
studies [7]. The area per molecule increases and the order parameter decreases with increasing temperature in the
pure system [23]. Moreover, the order parameter decreases continuously from the head group to the end of the tails in
the bilayer center. This means that the tails in the center of the bilayer are only very weakly aligned with the bilayer
normal, especially at high alcohol and DMSO concentrations. It is conceivable that at higher alcohol concentrations
the order may be completely lost. At very high alcohol concentrations interdigitation between opposing monolayers
has been experimentally observed [56]. Here, no interdigitation was observed as we study much lower concentrations
(cf. Fig. 3b). The thickness of pure bilayers shrinks as the phospholipids become less ordered. This means that in the
z-direction – deﬁned to be the normal to the bilayer surface – one ﬁnds a negative heat expansion coeﬃcient. The
overall heat expansion coeﬃcient is positive as the increase in area overcompensates the loss in thickness. Figure 3a
shows the density proﬁle of a pure DPPC bilayer. We clearly see the self–assembly of the system into a water region
with a density very close to bulk water, an interface with a high local density as the heavy phosphorus atoms are
located in this area, and an aliphatic region well below water density in the center. The plane of lowest density
in the middle of the bilayer where the lipid tails from opposing leaﬂets meet is a symmetry plane, which we deﬁne
as the z = 0 plane. The interface region contains some water and the lipid head groups, which include the choline
and phosphate groups with the density increasing up to around 1400 kg/m3. A small addition of 1.0 wt% methanol
leads to an overall decrease of the bilayer density which suggests an increase in the area per molecule. This is indeed

FIG. 2: Order parameter for DPPC at 325 K in dependence of concentration of added small molecules. We average over
both tails. Note that the data for trehalose is diﬀerent from the one presented in [23] as we are presenting data at a lower
temperature. Carbon number 1 is closest to the headgroup and carbon number 15 is the end of the tails.

observed (cf. Table. I), as well as an increase in the bilayer thickness, leading to an overall decrease of bilayer density.
This result actually challenges the typical experimental assumption of constant bilayer density often used to calculate
changes in layer thickness [35, 36]. To characterize the structure of the bilayer at least two independent measurements
out of the set thickness, area, and density are necessary.

Experimentally it is found that low molecular weight alcohols increase the area per molecule and decrease the order.
The experimental increase for an SOPC bilayer [36] is of the order of ∆A/A ≈ 0.1 at 5 wt% methanol. Consequently,
the thickness of the membrane is inferred to be thinned out. Measurements using DPPC or other fully saturated
phosphatidylcholines have not yet been reported. The only simulation study of alcohols on bilayers we are aware of [20]
did not allow for changes in the box–size in the plane of the membrane as that study focused on local structural eﬀects
and dynamics, and hence it is not possible to directly compare our results to those of Feller et al. [20]. Here we ﬁnd a
linear dependence of the area expansion on alcohol concentration as well as an increase of the eﬀect from methanol to
ethanol which is in line with the experimentally observed increase of the area expansion with alcohol chain length [36].
A more detailed analysis of the alcohol–bilayer interaction is found in Ref. [21].

Bemporad et al. measured free energies of transition through a lipid bilayer for various small molecules [22].
Although their numbers for the permeability are an order of magnitude too large, it is clear that methanol faces a
barrier which is almost as high as the one for water. It is highly unlikely for the methanols to cross the bilayer. This
is very much in agreement with our density proﬁles as we do not ﬁnd any methanol molecules inside the layer. For
ethanol, however, a few molecules were found inside the layer in agreement with the old Traube rule [57] which says
that interfacial tension drops by a constant factor as one adds methylene groups.

The simulations with trehalose revealed only small changes to the lipid bilayer. We found a slight increase in
the order parameter with increasing sugar concentration; this eﬀect was earlier found to be more pronounced for
trehalose than for its isomer sucrose [23]. We ﬁnd that trehalose stabilizes and preserves the membrane under cooling
without aﬀecting its structure. This is understandable from the point of view of cryo–preservation and also due to
the fact taht sugars are an abundant nutrient of cells and membrane integrity must not be strongly aﬀected by their
presence (see ref.[23] for additional results and discussions). As seen from the density proﬁles in Fig. 3c, trehalose
does not penetrate into the bilayer and accumulates at the headgroups. The sugar molecules hydrogen bond to the
lipid headgroups, one trehalose molecule can bind to up to three lipids.

Pereira et al. performed simulations of a DPPC bilayer in water with much higher concentrations of trehalose and

found very similar eﬀects [24]. The area per molecule is almost unaﬀected even with 128 molecules of trehalose for
128 molecules of DPPC. The same is true for the order parameter. Their simulation model is diﬀerent so that the
area per molecule cannot be compared directly, they get 0.58 nm2 for the pure DPPC system at 325 K. But it is clear
that the eﬀect of trehalose is very similar in two independent studies with distinctly diﬀerent models.

For the bilayer system containing DMSO, the area per molecule is increased, but not as strongly as in the presence
of methanol or ethanol, and consequently we observe a decrease in the order parameter. A concentration of about
18 wt% DMSO is needed to get the same increase in area per molecule as with 3 wt% methanol. Even if the molar

6

concentrations are considered for comparison, we obtain the same eﬀect with 1.6 mol% methanol versus 5 mol%
DMSO.

As described earlier, we see an increase in the thickness of the bilayer upon addition of methanol. We measured
the thickness of the bilayer as the distance between the planes of highest density of the overall system. In the pure
system (DPPC and water only) we obtained a layer thickness of 3.68 nm. Addition of 1 wt% methanol gave 4.00 nm,
whereas 18 wt% DMSO lead to a decrease to 3.24 nm. This suggests that the change in the bilayer thickness can not
be directly inferred from the change in the area per molecule. Again we see that trehalose has the weakest inﬂuence
with a thickness of 3.50 nm. The errors on the thickness estimation are at most around 0.2 nm.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have found, in agreement with experimental data, that trehalose has a stabilizing eﬀect on lipid bilayers.
The bilayer structure is essentially unchanged from the structure of the pure system even if the temperature is
lowered [23, 30]. However, the presence of alcohol or DMSO is contrastingly diﬀerent: small concentrations of alcohol
have a detrimental eﬀect on the bilayer structure, the inﬂuence of DMSO being somewhat less pronounced. The area
per molecule and bilayer thickness increase in the presence of alcohols, leading to a decrease in the overall density of
the bilayer. The opposite eﬀect is observed with DMSO, as the bilayer density is relatively unchanged, and the area
per molecule increase leads to a thinning of the bilayer.

These results suggest that the area per molecule and the alkyl tail order parameter are strongly anti–correlated,
that is, an increase in the order parameter is accompanied by a decrease in area per molecule and vice–versa. Similar
results have been found in a recent study on chesterol phospholipid interaction [19]. This is understood as the area
per molecule describes the two–dimensional packing density of the headgroups and the tails. The closer the alkyl
tails are packed, the more they are ordered. It is generally accepted that the phase transition to the gel phase –
with a strong increase in order parameter – at lower temperatures is due to tail packing. At this moment, it is not
clear if there is a correlation of the bilayer thickness to the degree diﬀerent molecules penetrate the bilayer. However,
even this cannot explain our observations as DMSO penetrates the bilayer better than the alcohols [20, 21, 25]. This
question remains open for the moment and further investigations are needed.

In the light of our ﬁndings, that there is no direct correlation between bilayer thickness and area per molecule, we
would recommend to use scattering experiments to obtain the layer thickness and not to rely on the assumption of
constant bilayer volume.

We conclude that atomistic simulations are a powerful means to study the interaction of small molecules with model
lipid bilayers and can give us detailed insight on the local mechanisms of interactions. In order to understand the
larger scale eﬀects, simulations with simpler models have to be applied [58, 59, 60, 61].

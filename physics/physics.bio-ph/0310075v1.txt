We discuss the possibility of controlling biological systems, by exciting in the near infrared region
hybrid metallic nanotube ropes, dressed with proteins and embedded in the biosystems.
If one
nanotube, in a double-tube rope, is ﬁlled with metallofullerenes and the other is empty, the two
tubes change their opposite equilibrium charging during the irradiation. The resulting change of the
local electric ﬁeld can deform proteins attached to the tubes, and change their catalytic properties.

INTRODUCTION

Over billions of years, a fascinating internal and ex-
ternal complexity evolved in myriads of competing bi-
ological species [1]. For example, many bacteria and
multi-cellular organisms use structure-sensitive proteins
to biomineralize nanocrystals [2], that form unique nan-
odevices. These cold-growth techniques [3] could greatly
complement growth methods developed by humans. In
general, biosystems and artiﬁcial nanosystems can co-
exist and supplement each other in a number of other
directions, in particular, during the release of drugs [4].
Their coevolution can lead to the formation of new hybrid
bio-nano (BIONA) systems, with unprecedented organi-
zational and functional level.

In this Letter, we discuss possible forms of communi-
cation between BIONA components. The (direct) “talk”
from the nanosystem to the biosystem could be real-
ized by controlling catalytic activity of its proteins. The
(backward) “talk” could be done by the cells, if they
change their local micro-environment or emit (electro-
magnetic) signals. The direct talk, that we explore here
in more details, could be based on electrochemical meth-
ods, used in bioelectronics [5]. Unfortunately, these tech-
niques require the presence of electrodes [6], that can-
not be easily applied inside cells. More promising is
thus their combination with contactless methods. Opti-
cal techniques [7] are convenient for their selectivity, but
the sensitive interior of cells prohibits the use of large
optical frequencies that can easily manipulate chemical
bonds. We could thus use the fact that cells are trans-
parent (up to 5 mm thick samples) for the near-infrared
(NIR) radiation (0.74-1.2µm).

The activity of biosystems could be manipulated via
artiﬁcial nanosystems, embedded in them, that absorb
in the NIR region. This approach is followed in photody-
namic therapies, where tumor cells are destructed chem-
ically, via NIR excitation of porphyrin-based molecules
with many extended electronic states [8]. Similar re-
sults can be obtained by heating the system locally
with ultrasound or microwave radiation or via NIR-
radiation heated metallic nanoparticles [9]. Silver and
gold nanoparticles [10], that can be produced biologi-
cally [11], are naturally excellent candidates for use in
bio-control.
In order to control tinny cellular sections,
one could also think of using nanotubes. Metallic C nan-

scribed in the text.

otubes form sensitive detectors in liquid environments
[12], and when dressed with bio-molecules, via structure-
selective [13, 14] or less speciﬁc hydrophobic coupling
[15], they can work as sensitive biosensors [16].

II. NIR-RADIATION CONTROL OF PROTEIN
ACTIVITY

The bio-control could be elegantly realized by a hy-
brid nanotube rope, heated by NIR-radiation, that is
formed of two adjacent metallic C nanotubes, where
one is (peapod) ﬁlled with metallofullerenes [17] and the
other is empty. In peapods, electrons can be transferred
to/from the C60 fullerenes under electric bias [18].
In
isolated metallofullerenes like Dy@C82, several electrons
are passed from Dy to C82. When these are used in a
peapod, the transferred electrons can be passed further
to the nanotube [19].
In a double-rope formed by this
peapod and a “twin” (empty) nanotube, the last would
absorb the excessive charge too, so the two would become
oppositely charged. This process can be partly inverted
at elevated temperatures [19], since the metallofullerenes
have levels close to the Fermi level [20, 21].

2

In Fig. 1, we schematically show the NIR-control of
protein (enzyme) activity, based on this process. The
NIR excitation heats the two nanotubes, so that elec-
trons, released in equilibrium from the fullerenes to the
peapod [19] and the twin tube, become transferred back.
This transfer is accompanied by recharging of the tubes,
and the resulting change of the local electric ﬁeld causes
deformation of proteins [22, 23], that are selectively at-
tached to the nanotubes. Their new conformation can
have a largely diﬀerent catalytic activity [24]. The system
thus works in an opposite way than some biosensors [25],
where antibodies bind to proteins attached to material
surfaces, bend them, and thus change the surface electric
parameters. We can tune the system by using diﬀer-
ent nanotubes, fullerenes and their ﬁlling, and especially
proteins, to be controlled. The attached proteins, that
in general could be much bigger than the tubular sys-
tem, might help to dissolve the hydrophobic nanotubes
in water.

III. MODELING OF THE CONTROL

We consider that the system is formed by two metallic
(10,10) carbon nanotubes of the radius rT ≈ 0.68 nm,
where one of them is the peapod. In a double-rope [26,
27], their centers are separated by DT ≈ 1.7 nm, which
determines the tunneling time, τt ≈ 1 ps, of electrons
between the tubes. The fullerenes are separated one from
another by dF ≈ 2 nm [21], and their charging strongly
but locally deforms electronic bands of the peapod [20].
We can excite the metallic nanotubes at deliberate NIR
frequencies. Their absorbtion ﬁts the Drude formula for
the dielectric function [28]

ε(ω) = ε∞

,

where ~ωp = 0.86 eV is the plasma frequency, ε∞ = 4.6
and τ = 5 × 10−15 s. The irradiation, needed to induce
reabsorbtion of electrons by the fullerenes, would have to
heat the nanotubes by several tens of degrees [19]. This
should not be harmful in vivo, if we use, for example,
short (few nanometers long) nanotube capsules [29], and
isolate them in liposomes [30], that can be delivered to
the cells by special techniques.

In the lack of available data, we assume here that one
electron per fullerene is reabsorbed during the irradiation,
and ≈ 20 % of those come from the empty tube. This
gives the NIR-radiation induced recharging density σ =
0.2 e/dF ≈ 0.1 e nm−1. From this σ, we can calculate
the change of electric ﬁeld between the two tubes.
If
we assume that these two are ideal metallic cylinders of
length L, their electric capacity is [31] (ε = ε0 εr)

Thus, the potential diﬀerence between the nanotubes due

to the induced charge transfer is

∆ϕ = σL/C ≈ 0.1 V ,

(3)

where we use the permitivity of water εr ≈ 4.6. Sim-
ilar voltage was used, for example, in manipulation of
proteins attached to metals [24].

Activation of the attached protein by this NIR-
radiation induced potential can be realized by moving
a charged tip of one of its domains [25] (see Fig. 2). We
model this process, by evaluating ﬁrst the potential en-
ergy of a charge q at the position r = (x, y). The two
cylinders with charge densities σ and −σ have their cen-
ters are at r1 and r2, respectively. The potential energy
of the charge q is formed by the direct Coulombic com-
ponent [31]

that can be either positive or negative, depending on
which of the oppositely charged tubes is closer. It also
has a negative screening component [32], originating in
the reﬂection of the external charge in the metallic tube,
that close to the surface of both tubes has the form

Here, we simply add the screening potentials of the two
tubes, neglecting thus multiple reﬂections.

Typically, structural domains in proteins perform
hinge or shear motion [22, 23]. These domains are of-
ten formed by (rigid) α-helices, connected by (ﬂexible)
β-sheets. The structures (conformations) of deformed
proteins in nature are usually close in energies, so that
they can be ﬂipped over by room temperature energies
kBT [22]. The conformations of the externally controlled
proteins should have diﬀerent catalytic properties and be
more energetically distant, so that they are not changed
at room temperatures.

In the present system, where the control of protein’s
motion is realized via dynamical charging of nanotubes,
we can also consider these two generic (hinge and shear)
conﬁgurations, shown schematically in Fig. 2. Since, the
tubes are diﬀerent and become charged in equilibrium,

the proteins should be able to distinguish them and de-
posit on them asymmetrically (see Figs. 1-2).
In the
bend conﬁguration (left), the trajectory of the controlled
protein domain is practically vertical, toward one of the
tube’s centers.
In the shear conﬁguration (right), the
trajectory of the domain goes approximately in parallel
with the vector connecting the tube’s centers of masses.
We assume that the balance of internal forces in the
protein, in the presence of equilibrium charging of the
tubes, adjusts the charged tip to a position r0 = (x0, y0).
The dependence of the protein energy around (close to)
this position can be considered to be parabolic

VR(r) ≈ Cx (x − x0)

(6)

where the constants Cx, Cy describe rigidity of the de-
formed protein [23]. Their values should be such, that
the diﬀerence in energies ∆E between the used confor-
mations is kTB < ∆E < 100 kJ/mol (1 eV), where the
last value is the lower energy limit required to deform
individual protein domains [23].

IV. DISCUSSION OF THE PROTEIN MOTION

In order to estimate which of the conﬁgurations, in
Fig. 2, can be more easily controlled, we calculate the
distance over which the protein domains move during the
NIR-radiation induced charge transfer. The tip moves
from the equilibrium position r0 to a new position r
0,
given by the local minimum of the total potential

′

VT (r) = VC (r) + VS(r) + VR(r) .

(7)

In Fig. 3 (up), we search this minimum for the “hinge”
conﬁguration, shown in Fig. 2 (left). The tube centers
are located at r1,2 = (x1,2, y1,2), x1,2 = ∓1.1 rT , y1,2 = 0.
We present the dependence of the potentials VC , VS, VR
and VT on the y distance from the center of the right
nanotube, and assume that a unit charge q = e is at
the tip of the domain [25]. The results are calculated
for the (eﬀective) charge density σ = 0.1 e/nm (equilib-
rium) and σ = 0 (irradiation). We position the domain
tip at x0 = x2, y0 = 2.5 rT and use the rigidity constant
Cy = 2 eV/nm−2. We can see that the change of the VC
potential energy, due to the induced charge transfer, is
small, while VS is rather large. With the above param-
eters, the VR potential can locally compensate the steep
VS, so that close to the tubes their sum is almost ﬂat.
Then, the weak VC potential can control the position of
the local minimum in VT , but the overall motion is quite
small (thin and thick solid line correspond to equilibrium
and irradiation, respectively). The magnitude of motion
could be enlarged, if we let the VT potential to loose the
local minimum in the absence of irradiation. Then the
domain position would ﬂuctuate from being adjacent to
the tube to being almost at r0.

Such a large motion can be obtained directly in the
“shear” conﬁguration, shown in Fig. 2 (right). Here, the

the text. From the local minima of VT , corresponding to the
change ∆σ = −0.1 e/nm of the charge density on the tubes,
we obtain the protein displacement ≈ 0.04 nm and ≈ 0.35
nm, respectively, shown by the arrows.

in-plane (of the tubes) components of the screening forces
largely cancel each other, and the out-of-plane compo-
nents are not eﬀective. Thus the system responds more
sensitively to the charging given by VC , as we show in
Fig. 3 (down). We use parameters, x0 = 0, y0 = 1.7 rT
and Cx = 0.5 eV/nm−2, so that VR can ﬂatten the two-
well minima of VS.
In equilibrium, the tube charging
causes that VT develops a minimum, close to one of the
VS minima. During the irradiation, the charging de-
creases and the minimum shifts to x = 0. Since the two
conformations are shifted in energy by ∆E ≈ 50 meV,
they would not ﬂip one to another at room temperatures
kTB < 30 meV. This domain motion is large enough to
control the protein (enzyme) activity. It could open or
block pockets on the “back side” of the protein, that is
not exposed to the nanotube, and change the catalytic
strength of the proteins.

We have demonstrated that NIR-radiation excited hy-
brid nanotube ropes could control the activity of proteins
in vivo. Nanotube systems might also directly activate

chemical reactions used in phototherapy [8], in particu-
lar, if special “porphyrin-like” defects are formed in the
nanotube walls. In vitro, one could also bias nanotubes
externally in order to control biochemical reactions or use
them in other applications on the nanoscale [33].

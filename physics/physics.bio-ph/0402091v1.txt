Abstract

We propose a model for chiral polymerisation and investigate its symmetric and
asymmetric solutions. The model has a source species which decays into left- and right-
handed types of monomer, each of which can polymerise to form homochiral chains;
these chains are susceptible to ‘poisoning’ by the opposite handed monomer. Homochiral
polymers are assumed to inﬂuence the proportion of each type of monomer formed from
the precursor. We show that for certain parameter values a positive feedback mechanism
makes the symmetric steady-state solution unstable.

The kinetics of polymer formation are then analysed in the case where the system
starts from zero concentrations of monomer and chains. We show that following a
long induction time, extremely large concentrations of polymers are formed for a short
time, during this time an asymmetry introduced into the system by a random external
perturbation may be massively ampliﬁed. The system then approaches one of the steady-
state solutions described above.

Introduction

Studies of the origins of life raise many associated fundamental questions. Among these,
one is concerned with the origin and propagation of molecular handedness. It is well known
that chirality is a signature of life as we know it. Nucleic acids contain only D-sugars while
proteins are made only from L-amino acids (although D-amino acides do occur in Nature
and even occasionally show up in some proteins (Jung, 1992). What leads to the synthesis of

1

homochiral polymers, in which all the constituent monomers have the same handedness ? And
what is responsible for the evolution of chiral purity, the more or less exclusive dominance of
one macromolecular handedness over its mirror image? These are questions of great interest
and importance and remain the subject of much discussion.

It is known that, in general, the addition of the correct enantiomer to a growing polymer
chain is more favourable that the wrong one (Joshi et al. 2000). Indeed Joyce et al.(1984)
showed that addition of the wrong-handed monomer to a growing oligonucleotide chain acts
as a chain terminator, stopping all further reaction. For the case of proteins, there is also the
driving force of the beneﬁcial secondary structures, such as α-helices and β-sheets, that may
arise from homochiral polymers. Given these assumptions, that wrong-handed monomers
inhibit chain growth, our paper is concerned with whether, starting from a racemic mixture
of monomers, it is possible to produce a system of homochiral polymers of a greater or lesser
degree of chiral purity. Starting from an achiral substrate, we shall be concerned with whether
it is possible to produce a system of homochiral polymers of high chiral purity by analysing
some plausible kinetic models.

There is some discussion of related matters and experimental observations in the recent
literature. Zubay (2000) provides a readable discussion of possible pre-biotic chemistry, while
Colonna et al. (1994) describes a number of alternative self-reproducing systems. Sandars
(2002) reviews the range and importance of chirality in biological systems, as well as the
chemical processes which lead to achiral states. After summarising a possible historical order
of events in the origin of life on Earth Sandars discusses the stages where a bifurcation to a
chiral state may occur. He then applies existing knowledge of chirality on Earth to speculate
on the question of extra-terrestrial life and its chirality.

Luisi’s group at ETH in Zurich has studied various polymeric systems in which left- and
right-handed monomers aggregate together to form larger than expected concentrations of
homochiral polymers (Blocher et al. 2001, and Hitz et al.2001). Hitz et al. present an analysis
of the data and postulate that the exess of homochiral polymers is due to a high-order Markov
process rather than the feedback mechanism which we analyse in this paper. It is readily un-
derstood that the rate coeﬃcient governing polymer growth may depend on the handedness of
the monomer to be attached to the chain and handedness of the monomer which currently ter-
minates the chain; however, with a high-order Markov processes this rate coeﬃcient may also
depend on the handedness of the penultimate (and possibly the antepenultimate) monomers
in the polymeric chain.

While oligopeptides spontaneously form homochiral sequences, Hitz & Luisi (2002) have
shown that the presence of quartz promotes the production of a high yield of homochiral
sequences. More recently (Hitz & Luisi, 2003) this has been quantiﬁed and the level of
enantiomeric exess in a system has been ampliﬁed from 20% to over 70% and in some cases
to 100%, by the presence of quartz.

The model of symmetry-breaking in chiral polymerisation which we explore in this paper
is based on a model suggested by Sandars (2003). Sandars gives an account of the history
of chemical discoveries leading up to the mechanisms of enantiomeric cross-inhibition and
autocatalysis upon which his and our models rely. Sandars integrates the resulting system of
ordinary diﬀerential equations numerically to explore the parameter regimes where symmetry-
breaking solutions exist. He observes a ‘phase-transition’ type of phenomenon where a small
change in the ﬁdelity of the feedback mechanism leads to a large-scale change in the steady-

2

state which the system as a whole converges to. Below a critical ﬁdelity in the nonlinear
feedback process the system approaches a symmetric state where equal amounts of left- and
right-handed polymers coexist, whilst above the critical ﬁdelity a homochiral state is ap-
proached in which one chirality of polymer dominates to the almost complete exclusion of the
other.

The model studied here includes the inhibition of homochiral sequences of long chains.
This bears some similarity with our modelling of cement hydration (Wattis & Coveney, 1997)
in which larger clusters were susceptible to poisoning by another component. Here the poison
is simply the monomer of opposite chirality, so each monomer can either act as an agent of
growth (of polymers of the same handedness) or of inhibition (of polymers of the opposite
handedness). This dual role leads to some subtle and interesting eﬀects since an abundance
of, say, right-handed polymers makes it unlikely for any left-handed polymeric sequences to
form, and the majority of left-handed monomers produced will be consumed by inhibiting
right-handed homochiral sequences - a ‘double-whammy’ eﬀect. This form of competition is
distinct to the models of nucleation involving competition we have analysed previously; for
example in Wattis (1999) and in Bolton & Wattis (2004) there is only one monomer which
assembles to form two morphologies of cluster. Competition is thus between the growth of
one type of cluster and that of another. However, similar mechanisms are operative in both
those examples and in the present paper, since both types of homochiral polymer sequence
(left and right) are ultimately composed from, and hence competing for, the same source
material.

We have investigated the growth of RNA chains in an earlier paper, (Wattis & Coveney,
1999) wherein we used a much more detailed and hence complicated model to assess the feasi-
bility of long self-replicating RNA sequences forming within a realistic timescale. While that
model of RNA polymerisation had no precursor species, it contained four types of nucleotide
monomer (A, C, G and T), both autocatalytic and cross-catalytic polymerisation mechanisms
and an important hydrolysis step that recycled growing RNA sequences. On the basis of plau-
sible assumptions about the prebiotic soup, and by invoking a number of approximations and
coarse-graining procedures, we were able to show that self-replicating RNA sequences are
ampliﬁed in such mixtures, while less capable replicators are driven to extinction.

By comparison, in the present paper we are able to construct a model which is more di-
rectly tractable using standard methods of mathematical analysis. The paper is structured as
follows. In section 2, we specify the basic kinetic model, while in section 3 we study its steady-
state solutions. Section 4 considers the time-dependent achiral solutions and investigates their
kinetic stability. Section 5 then considers the case of perfect chiral symmetry-breaking. It is
followed by a discussion (section 6) and conclusions from our work are presented in section 7.

2 The kinetic model

2.1 Microscopic modelling

We aim to investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a system which allows both right-
and left-handed chiral polymers to form. We assume there is some achiral source S which
spontaneously transforms into right- and left-handed monomers at a slow rate ε; we also
assume that the presence of longer chiral polymers (denoted L or R) accelerates the formation

3

of monomers of the same chirality. Thus we shall be concerned with the following set of coupled
chemical reactions:

where L1, R1 are the left and right monomer species respectively while Q (P ) represents some
measure of the total concentrations of left-handed (right-handed) homochiral polymers in the
system. The precise forms of these rate processes will be speciﬁed later (see equation (4)).
The rate coeﬃcients of the reactions are ε, k. We shall assume that ε
k, and that k depends
on the length of the polymer L, R. The parameter f in these rate coeﬃcients is the ﬁdelity of
the feedback mechanism; typically this will not be perfect, that is, f < 1 is likely in general.
This model has some similarities with models we have studied in other areas of investi-
gation; for example, the kinetics of micelle-formation in ethyl caprylate (Coveney & Wattis,
1996). In this system the breakdown of caprylate ester into monomer occurs spontaneously
at some slow rate, but is massively accelerated by the presence of micelles, which have a
catalytic role in the breakdown of the source species. In the present paper this mechanism
is more complex since there are two monomers, and there is an additional ﬁdelity parameter
since long left- or right-handed sequences can promote the formation of the oppositely-handed
(right/left) monomer as well as its own. In the caprylate system, unusual kinetic behaviour is
observed when the system is initiated without any product present. The system is then eﬀec-
tively in a metastable state, and very little appears to happen for a long time. Following this
induction time, the kinetics then proceed fairly rapidly. We expect to see similar behaviour
in the current model in the case ε

1.

Sandars’ model (2003) diﬀers from ours in that his imposes a maximum polymer length,
typically set at ﬁve, and only polymers of this maximum length act catalytically in the
breakdown of the source into monomers. We allow polymers to grow to arbitrary lengths,
and chiral polymers of all lengths have some degree of eﬃcacy in the autocatalytic feedback
mechanism by which the source species decays to form chiral monomers.

≪

The monomers will be allowed to combine to form chirally pure polymers, denoted by Ln

and Rn according to

Ln + L1

Ln+1,

Rn + R1

Rn+1.

We assume that the monomer of opposite handedness may attach to a growing polymer and
so inhibit its growth; such inhibited sequences will be denoted by RLn for a polymer Ln which
has been terminated by an R1 monomer, and LRn for the corresponding RnL1 polymer. We
denote the rate of such reactions by aχ. Thus we have the two rate processes

Ln + R1

RLn,

Rn + L1

LRn.

However, the sequences RLn, LRn are treated as inert products which have no inﬂuence on
the other rate processes; therefore their concentrations can be ignored in the mathematical
modelling of the chemical reactions. Following Joyce et al. (1984) we assume no further
growth of these products can occur. The system studied by Joshi et al. (2000) corresponds
to 0 < χ < 1; however, we shall consider the full range of possible χ > 0.

2.2 Macroscopic model

To close the system of rate equations ensuing from the scheme (1)–(3) we shall assume that the
source chemical, S, is added to the system at some constant rate S0. We deﬁne macroscopic
quantities for the total concentration of all homochiral sequences of each type of polymer by
L and R, and the mass of monomers in each set of homochiral sequences by Q, P in schema

A considerable advantage of the present model is that it is possible to reduce the complexity
of the corresponding inﬁnite set of rate equations (5)–(9), resulting in a closed system of only
seven equations which contains the dynamics of the full system. This is based on the quantities

The rate processes described in terms of equations (10)–(16) are depicted in Figure 2.
This reduction from an inﬁnite system of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations to a system
of just seven ordinary diﬀerential equations is remarkable in that it is an exact simpliﬁcation
– no approximations have been made. Such an exact reduction would not be possible if the
growth rate coeﬃcients were dependent on polymer length.
If appropriate at all it would
then have to rely on approximations, and an accurate approximation may require not just
the zeroth and ﬁrst moments of the distributions Ln, Rn, but on higher moments as well.

Figure 2: Illustration of our homochiral polymerisation scheme including the nonlinear feed-
back mechanisms. The quantities LRn, RLn are not included in the mathematical model
since they play no role in the reaction scheme. The quantities L, R refer to the total numer
of polymers of each handedness, and P, Q to the total mass of material in polymeric form. It
is these latter quantities (P , Q) which determine the eﬀectiveness of the catalytic breakdown
of the source species into monomers.

2.3 Transforming the system of kinetic equations

Before we analyse the steady-state kinetics, it is useful to recast the system of seven ordinary
diﬀerential equations in an alternative form. Instead of describing the concentration of each
species separately, we assign variables for the total concentrations of source material (S),
monomers (µ), sequences (N) and sequence mass (M),

µ = L1 + R1,

N = L + R,

M = P + Q,

(17)

6

and a set of variables δ, θ, η for the proportions of right-handed molecules in each of µ, N, M
respectively

δ =

L1
R1 −
R1 + L1

,

θ =

R
L
−
R + L

,

η =

.

These quantities relate to the chiral purity of the system: δ is the chiral purity of the monomers
(µ), θ and η describe the chiral purity of the homochiral polymer chains, θ being a number-
weighted measure (corresponding to N) and η a mass-weighted measure (corresponding to
M).

We transform the kinetic equations (10)–(16) into the variables relating to the concentra-

tions of polymers given by (17)–(18) and hence obtain the seven coupled equations

(25)

The advantage of (19)–(25) over (10)–(16) lies in the considerable reduction in the amount of
algebra required to derive solutions; for example it is easy to see that δ = θ = η = 0 satisﬁes
(23)–(25), leaving a system of four equations (19)–(22) for the four unknowns S, µ, N, M.

The equations (19)–(25) will be used throughout the rest of the paper. In later sections
we shall consider the equations for the symmetric growth of homochiral polymer sequences,
(19)–(22), separately from the equations describing the chiral purity of the system, (23)–(25).

3 Steady-state behaviour

For the analysis of the steady-state solutions all the right-hand sides of equations (10)–(16), or
equations (19)–(25) are set to zero. For the later stages of the calculation of the steady-states
we ignore the small parameter ε (that is, we set ε = 0), since this will allow explicit analytical
formulae to be derived and this will not greatly inﬂuence the steady-states. The reason for
this is that once there are appreciable numbers of polymers of either handedness present in
the system, the catalytic breakdown of source will dominate the production of monomers of
(ε) terms in equations (10)–(16) will be reinstated later where the
both handednesses. The
kinetics of the system starting from zero initial data are investigated.

The most important thing to notice about the second term here is that asymmetric (chiral,
= 0) solutions permit longer chains to be produced. For the symmetric solution (δ = 0)
i.e. δ
we have M/N = 2 + 1/χ; whereas if δ approaches
1 then arbitrarily large chains can be
produced. We note that large inhibition rates (χ) reduce the expected sequence length (as
one might expect); however, we shall show later on that this eﬀect is compensated for since
larger values for χ make it easier for the system to adopt a chiral state.

±

It is more natural to express solutions in terms of µ, δ than L1, R1. The chiral purity of
the polymers can be deﬁned in two ways, one by the mass-weighted purity (η) and the other
in terms of the number-weighted purity (θ). At steady-state we have

θ = δ

Thus if the chiral purity of the monomer, δ, departs from zero, then the chiral purity of the
homochiral sequences (θ and η) also do, and by greater amounts, as illustrated in Figure 3.
This can be seen from the linearisations for small δ which give θ = 3δ and η = (5 + 2χ)δ/(1 +
2χ). For large χ the curve for η approaches that for θ.

Figure 3: Graph of steady-state values for the chiral purities (θ, η) of the homochiral sequences

the accentuated eﬀect of symmetry-breaking in the homochiral sequences compared to the
monomers. The solid line corresponds to θ; the dashed lines refer to η. The steepest curve
relates to χ = 0, the next to χ = 1 and that for χ = 2 is the closest to the θ curve.

Finally we have to determine the chiral purity of the monomers, δ. This is the most compli-
cated part of the calculation so, for the sake of clarity, we now set ε = 0; δ is then given by
either δ = 0, the symmetric (achiral) steady-state solution or, in terms of the ﬁdelity, by

We shall discuss this chiral solution in further detail later on (Section 3.2). One question we
aim to address in the remainder of this section is how small f could be, and the system still
exhibit a bifurcation to a non-symmetric state.

3.1 The symmetric, achiral, steady-state solution

It is not immediately obvious that all the solutions given above in equations (27)–(34) for
the steady-state exist for all parameter values, or whether any particular solution is unique.
Hence we start by considering the symmetric solution, where δ = θ = η = 0. This solution
exists for all parameter values and in this case we have

zero as time increases. In our example, clearly A > 0 whatever values χ and f take, but the
other two conditions are less clear. The condition C > 0 gives f > fc(χ) with fc(χ) given by

fc(χ) =

2(2 + χ)(1 + 2χ)
(5 + 6χ)(1 + 3χ)

.

(42)

This value for fc agrees with f as given by (34) in the case δ = 0. The condition AB > C
implies an instability when f > fc2(χ); however, fc2(χ) lies in the region f > 1 for all χ so
this instability can be ignored, since only f
1 is physically realisable. So the symmetric
≤
solution is stable for f < fc, and unstable for f > fc. The value of fc lies between 2/9 and
4/5 and depends on χ: at χ = 0; the achiral solution is unstable for f > 4/5, whereas at large
χ, the instability of the achiral solution occurs for f > 2/9.

3.2 The chiral (asymmetric) steady-state solution

Once f > fc(χ) we have the existence of two chiral steady-states as well as the achiral steady-
state. Furthermore, since the Routh-Hourwitz criteria are ‘necessary and suﬃcient’ for the
(λ) < 0, once f > fc the achiral solution becomes
existence of a solution of (41) with
unstable, so will not be observed in any physical system. Thus once the chiral solutions exist,
they become the ‘preferred’ steady-state solutions since they are mathematical stable. Even
if a system were artiﬁcially put into the symmetric (achiral) state, any small perturbation
would cause some chiral imbalance and the natural kinetics of the model would then carry the
whole system to one of the two steady chiral states in which one handedness of homochiral
polymers dominates the other.

ℜ

At f = fc a bifurcation occurs, and two mirror-image chiral solutions appear. We now
brieﬂy examine the neighbourhood of this point in more detail. These chiral steady-states
are governed by equation (34); from this equation we note δ = 0 implies f = fc. Assuming
small δ and expanding we ﬁnd f = fc + βδ2 with β > 0 so the bifurcation is supercritical, and
the new solutions exist in f > fc where the achiral solution is unstable. Thus, as expected,
the bifurcation occurs at exactly the same position as that at which the achiral steady-state
becomes unstable. This is a standard result in bifurcation theory; see Guckenheimer & Holmes
(1983) or Berg´e et al. (1984) for more details. Although this is a curve in (f, χ) space, we shall
consider f to be the primary bifurcation parameter, with the bifurcation point fc depending
on χ.

In ﬁgure 4 we show the chiral steady-state solutions given by (34) parametrically, plotting
δ against f and χ. The bifurcation occurs at fc = 4/5 if χ = 0, reducing to fc = 2/9 in the
limit of large χ. Thus we see the beneﬁcial eﬀect of sequence inhibition if one wants a system
which undergoes a symmetry-breaking bifurcation at small values of the ﬁdelity parameter f .
Figure 5 shows the chiral purities of the polymers, ﬁrstly weighted by number (θ) and then
by mass (η). Both show that the chiral purity of the polymers is much greater than that
of the monomer (compare Figure 5 with Figure 4). Note also that for the range of ﬁdelities
2/9 < f < 4/5 the bifurcation to asymmetric (chiral) solutions can occur by increasing χ.

Another natural question to pose here is whether only small and moderate values of δ can
1 to determine under what conditions δ can approach
be accessed; we put ν = 1
unity. We ﬁnd from equation (34) that f = 1
χν. In this case we also expect θ and η to
be near unity. In fact the chiral purity of the polymeric sequences is much enhanced over the

In summary we ﬁnd that chiral solutions do indeed exist provided f > fc and this is easier
to satisfy at larger inhibition rates (χ). Thus the presence of stronger cross inhibition aids
the manifestation of chiral steady-states. Also, the higher the ﬁdelity (f ), the greater the
dominance of one chirality over the other.

We now turn to an analysis of the kinetics of sequence growth, in order to determine at

what stage of the reaction the system is likely to manifest a chiral state.

4 Kinetics and stability of achiral solutions

In this section we reintroduce the
the kinetic problem for the achiral solution, in the limit ε
1. We assume that initially there
are no monomers (µ = 0), no polymers (M = N = 0) and no precursor (S = 0), though this
source material is added continuously to the system starting at time t = 0. If ε = 0 then since
there are no polymers, the precursor cannot be broken down and no polymers will ever form,
(ε) term to produce some monomer. In section 4.2 we analyse the stability
so we need the

damped out, as the total number of polymers and monomers grow from zero concentrations.

We assume a set of initial conditions in which η = θ = 0 = δ, and then η = θ = 0 = δ for all
subsequent times. This reduces the system (19)–(25) to a system of three ordinary diﬀerential
equations which we solve asymptotically in the limit ε

timescale.
In this timescale we have seen the accumulation of source material, but this is
only slowly converted into monomers and chains, so both of these grow very slowly, causing
a big build up of source material until, at the end of this timescale, we see the concentration
of chains increase to the level where the catalytic mechanism becomes active and accelerates
the formation of monomers and chains.

As the chains are present in large enough quantities for the catalytic mechanism to be active,
and since there is a large amount of source material present at the start of this timescale,
this source material is rapidly converted into monomers and chains so that µ2, N2 and M2
all increase at the expense of the source species, S, whose concentration now monotonically
reduces, so that the only signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation in the equations is in the equation for S2.
No explicit solution which matches back into Timescale I is available; however, the form
of the large-time solution in Timescale II can be determined. Consider new timescale given

by a combination of a complimentary function which solves the system with Q(t) = 0 and a
particular solution which satisﬁes the Q(t) input term in equation (57). For general parameter
values, the forms of these solutions cannot be explicitly determined, however we shall study
the two particular limits of large and small χ in which approximations can be obtained. These
correspond respectively to the cases where the solution is dominated by the particular solution
and the complimentary function at large times.

As S2, µ2, N2 and M2 all decay like 1/t2 at the end of the previous timescale, the new ﬁrst
term to become signiﬁcant is the S0 input into the S equation. This becomes signiﬁcant when
t2 = ε−1/5, thus the third timescale is t = ε−1/5t1c + t3. In this timescale all of S, µ, M and

and over this timescale the system approaches its steady-state. Since at leading order the
εS terms are neglected, the leading order steady-state solution approached is precisely that
described in Section 3.

Overall, we see that there is a long induction time, of

(ε−1/5), followed by a some rapid
kinetics during which the system explores states a long way from its steady-state, and then
over a relatively fast (
(1)) timescale the system approaches its steady-state. We now derive
the kinetics of the achiral solution for smaller χ before going to address the stability of the
growing achiral solution.

Numerical simulations suggest that at the end of TII, S2 and µ2 decay exponentially (in t2) to
zero, with M2 and N2 tending to constant values; eventually reaching their
(1) steady-state
values over subsequent and much longer timescales (see later subsections and Figure 7 for
example).

The linear system (57)–(59) is solved by the sum of a particular solution and a compli-
mentary function. For smaller χ the large-time solution is dominated by the complimentary
solution component of the solution (i.e. that with Q = 0) which is given by a combination
i√2χ, thus
of exponentials. In the case χ

Since all concentrations approached constants at the end of TIII, their magnitudes remain
unchanged for the fourth timescale, only the scaling for t changes, we now write

4.1.9 Summary

For all values of the parameters, the solution starts with a long induction period during which
the concentration of the precursor species S becomes large. There follows a short period of very
rapid kinetics where all concentrations become large, and then the precursor and monomer
concentrations decay. For larger values of χ the concentration of polymers also decays and
the steady-state is reached relatively rapidly. For smaller χ the monomer concentration and
that of the source species become very small and the polymer concentrations (mass-weighted
and number weighted) both remain high and slowly evolve to their steady-state values over
a longer timescale, which is of similar length to the induction timescale. These two distinct
behaviours are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7.

4.2 Stability of the achiral growing solution

Having determined the form of the kinetic behaviour for the achiral solution (η = θ = δ = 0),
we now consider the linear stability of this solution. Assuming there is some small random
perturbation during the evolution, we ask whether a perturbation grows or decays as time
progresses. We shall use the already determined solution for S(t), µ(t) N(t) and M(t) (from
section 4.1), and assume that the perturbation does not make any alteration to these total
concentrations of source, monomer and polymer at leading order. This assumption was seen to
be valid in the case of the steady-state solution, and since the kinetic equations are symmetric
under the transformation (δ, θ, η)
η), we expect modiﬁcations to µ, N, M, S also
to be of second order in δ, θ, η. From equations (23)–(25) we have

It is clear that this matrix has a simpler structure than the general case, which has only one

Applying the Routh-Hourwitz criteria for the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues, we ﬁnd
stability of the achiral solution requires A > 0 (which always holds), and C > 0 which fails
when f > aN 2µ2/2kM 2S2; and a similar but more stringent inequality from the condition
AB > C. So if S2 decays faster than µ2 then the symmetric solution is stable, and if
S2 and µ2 decay at the same rate the stability depends on N 2 and M 2 and requires f >

Rewriting this as λ3 + Aλ2 + Bλ + C, the Routh-Hourwitz criterion A > 0 is always satisﬁed.
The condition C > 0 implies f < aµ3N3/2kS3M3 which, at large times, reduces to f < 1,
and as such is met in the large-time limit. Finally, AB > C fails if f > N3/(N3 + χM3)
indicating an instability; whilst this depends on the unknown number-weighted and mass-
weighted polymer concentrations, an instability is certainly possible for large enough values
of the ﬁdelity parameter, f .

4.2.5 Stability of achiral solution in Timescale IV, smaller χ

Since the scalings for the concentrations S, µ, N and M are as in timescale III, the only
change from (89) is in the rate of growth of the perturbations since d/dt4 and d/dt3 scales
diﬀerently with time and N4, M4 are now time-dependent; we now have

As the solution progresses through timescale IV, the criterion for an instability to exist,
namely f > N4/(N4 + χM4), becomes easier to satisfy, since N4 decays slightly faster than
M4, as shown by equations (81)–(82).

4.3 Summary

In this section we have analysed the kinetics of the concentrations of monomer, source and
polymer as they evolve from zero to steady-state following a symmetric (achiral) solution.

In section 4.2 we analysed the linear stability of the growing achiral state through the
sequence of timescales. By linear stability we mean that small external random forces which
cause a chiral imbalance will be damped and reduce in amplitude. An instability indicates
that such a perturbation will grow and so the system will undergo a symmetry-breaking
bifurcation to occur during the evolution.

As the system approaches steady-state in the third timescale we expect to regain the
stability criteria f > fc(χ) with fc given by equation (42). However, this criterion for the

21

instability of the achiral solution is not valid in all the timescales; in the ﬁrst timescale we
ﬁnd the alternative criteria of f > 1
2 for symmetry-breaking to occur. Note that this is
independent of χ, since in the ﬁrst timescale the polymer and monomer concentrations are
so low that inhibition of a homochiral polymer by a monomer of the opposite chirality is
negligible; this leads to a considerable simpliﬁcation of the linear stability analysis during the
ﬁrst timescale. In the second timescale we ﬁnd an instability for f < 2/3.

For f < 2/9 the achiral solution is always stable to such perturbations; whereas for
2/9 < f < 1/2 the system is unstable to such perturbations only in the ﬁnal stage of the
kinetics, when the equilibrium solution is being approached and even then only for some
values of χ. For 1/2 < f < 2/3 the kinetics are more complicated since the system is unstable
during the ﬁrst timescale, but linearly stable during the second timescale and unstable during
the ﬁnal approach to equilibrium. Thus for these f -values the chiral purity may oscillate, but
the system will eventually approach a chiral state.

For smaller values of χ the kinetics are more complex: there is still a long induction
time followed by a period of rapid kinetics. This is more complicated, being split into vari-
ous timescales; however the end result is always low concentrations of monomer and source
species and large concentrations of polymer. There follows a long timescale over which the
polymer concentrations reduce towards steady-state and the monomer concentrations and
source species increase to steady-state.

For smaller values of χ an instability occurs in Timescale I for f > 1

2, the instability
persists in timescale II, now depending on f > 1/(2(1
kM 2/aN 2)). In timescale III and IV
34χ/25. Thus, for
an instability requires f > N/(N + χM), and at steady-state f > 4/5
smaller χ there is still the possibility of a symmetry-breaking bifurcation occurring, though
it requires a larger ﬁdelity parameter.

−

−

Although there advantages in χ being large if one is seeking a symmetry-breaking bifur-
cation, it should be noted that smaller χ has other advantages, in that it allows polymers to
form in larger concentrations, and these persist for longer times.

5 Perfect ﬁdelity

In the extreme case f = 1 the feedback mechanism breaks down the precursor species (S) into
chirally pure monomers with unit probability. Instead of a chirally pure homochiral steady
state, there is a bifurcation to a state in which δ asymptotically approaches
1. We refer to
such a state as a fully-bifurcated state. From equation (34) we see that such a state cannot
arise if f < 1. The large-time asymptotics of the fully-bifurcated state diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
f < 1 since now there is no steady-state solution; instead we ﬁnd unlimited growth of one set
of homochiral polymer sequences and decay to zero for the sequences of opposite handedness.
In this case (still ignoring ε) the large time asymptotics are given by

Thus once again we see the less common homochiral polymer sequences assuming concentra-

Thus, we see the convergence to full chiral purity is more rapid for polymers than for
monomers.

In all the above analysis there is another chiral solution in which the left-handed ho-
mochiral polymer sequences are dominant, and the right-handed homochiral sequences have
concentrations which decay to zero asymptotically.

6 Discussion

After introducing our model in Section 2, we analysed its steady-states, and found that
the symmetric steady-state solution exists for all parameter values, but that there are other
solutions when the relative inhibition rate χ and the ﬁdelity f are large enough. The critical
combination is

f > fc =

(4 + 2χ)(1 + 2χ)
(5 + 6χ)(1 + 3χ)

.

(106)

At the point f = fc there is a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, where two unstable steady-
state solutions connect to the solution δ = 0 and make δ = 0 unstable for f > fc. When
this inequality is satisﬁed there are two stable steady-state solutions with δ non-zero, that is
there are chiral solutions as well as the achiral solution, and the achiral solution is unstable,
so any physical system will generically be attracted to one or other of the chiral solutions. An
important eﬀect to note from this formula is the role that cross-inhibition plays in making
the asymmetric solutions accessible at low values of the ﬁdelity. For small χ, the ﬁdelity has
to exceed fc = 0.8 in order to obtain a symmetry-breaking solution; whereas at large χ, this
bifurcation point reduces to fc = 0.22 – a dramatic reduction.

In Section 4 we analysed the kinetics of chain growth in a symmetric system, and found that
there is a long induction time, during which a large stock of precursor chemical accumulates;
an approximate, linear stability calculation shows that during this time, the achiral solution is
unstable if f > 1/2. This behaviour is followed by a short timescale over which the precursor
species is converted to monomers which are then polymerised. For this short time, monomers
and chains are present in large concentrations. The concentrations of chains, monomers
and precursor then all decay to their steady-state values, which, if the parameters f, χ are
such that an asymmetric steady-state exists, and the system has experienced some external
perturbation away from the symmetric state, will be the chiral steady-state discussed earlier
(section 3.2). In such a state both monomers and chains have a net chirality or handedness.
Even for quite modest values of the chiral purity of monomer (say δ = 0.7), the chiral purity
of chains is extremely close to unity (θ = 0.990, η = 0.995 at χ = 2); see Figure 3, and
compare Figures 4 and 5.

Finally we have described the large-time asymptotics of the ‘fully’ bifurcated case which
arises when f = 1, wherein chiral purities (δ, θ and η) approach unity in the large time limit;
this remains true even when we reintroduce the term which describes the slow spontaneous
achiral decay of precursor species into both enantiomeric forms of monomer.

7 Conclusions

In previous work we showed how qualitatively similar instabilities can lead to the massive
ampliﬁcation of self-replicating RNA polymer sequences over less eﬃcient replicators (Wattis
& Coveney, 1999).

In the present paper we have shown that an initially achiral system capable of stepwise
polymerisation to homochiral polymer sequences with inhibition from the opposite-handed
monomer, is subject to strong instabilities that drive the system overwhelmingly to one or
other handedness for all homochiral sequences present. Mechanisms within this class may
have played a rˆole during the early stages of molecular evolution in determining the chirality
of biologically relevant macromolecules, such as nucleotides and proteins, and there is ex-
perimental evidence of this behaviour in the literature, for examples see Hitz et al. (2001,
2002, 2003) and Joshi (2000). Although in the system studied by Joshi, addition of the cor-
rect enantiomer to a growing polymer chain is more favourable than the wrong one, we have
shown that if this cross-inhibition is stronger, then the system is more likely to undergo a
symmetry-breaking bifurcation.

Studies of this kind conﬁrm the scope and power of modern methods of theoretical analysis
for nonlinear dynamical systems of the kind that abound along the pathway towards the
origins of life (Coveney, 1994).

Abstract

Many crucial biological processes operate with surprisingly small numbers

of molecules, and there is renewed interest in analyzing the impact of noise

associated with these small numbers. Twenty–ﬁve years ago, Berg and Pur-

cell showed that bacterial chemotaxis, where a single celled organism must

respond to small changes in concentration of chemicals outside the cell, is

limited directly by molecule counting noise, and that aspects of the bacte-

ria’s behavioral and computational strategies must be chosen to minimize the

eﬀects of this noise [1]. Here we revisit and generalize their arguments to

estimate the physical limits to signaling processes within the cell, and argue

that recent experiments are consistent with performance approaching these

limits.

I. INTRODUCTION

A striking fact about biological systems is that single molecular events can have macro-

scopic consequences. The most famous example is of course the storage of genetic informa-

tion in a single molecule of DNA, so that changes in the structure of this single molecule

(mutations) can have eﬀects on animal behavior and body plan from generation to genera-

tion [2]. But there also are examples where the dynamics of individual molecular interactions

can inﬂuence behavior on much shorter time scales. Thus we (and other animals) can see

when a single molecule of rhodopsin in the rod cells of the retina absorbs a photon [3], and

some animals can smell a single molecule of airborne odorant [4]. Even if a single molecular

event does not generate a speciﬁc behavior, it may still be that the reliability of behavior is

limited by inevitable ﬂuctuations associated with counting random molecular events. Thus

the visual system has a regime where perception is limited by photon shot noise [5,6], and

the reliability with which bacteria can swim up a chemical gradient appears to be limited

by noise in the measurement of the gradient itself [1]. It is an open question whether bio-

chemical signaling systems within cells operate close to the corresponding counting noise

limits.

The classical analysis of bacterial chemotaxis by Berg and Purcell provided a simple

estimate and a clear intuitive picture of the noise in ‘measuring’ chemical concentrations.

Their argument was that if we have a sensor with linear dimensions a, we expect to count an

average of ¯N

¯ca3 molecules when the mean concentration is ¯c. Each such measurement,

∼

however, is associated with a noise δN1

√ ¯N . A volume with linear dimension a can be

∼

a2/D, so if we are willing to integrate over a time τ we

cleared by diﬀusion in a time τD ∼
should be able to make Nmeas

∼

estimate of N by a factor of √Nmeas. The result is that our fractional accuracy in measuring

τ /τD independent measurements, reducing the noise in our

N, and hence in measuring the concentration c itself, is given by

A crucial claim of Berg and Purcell is that this result applies when the sensor is a single

receptor molecule, so that a is of molecular dimensions, as well as when the sensor is the

whole cell, so that a

1 µm. In particular, imagine a cell of radius R which has receptor

∼

∼

molecules of size a on its surface. With just one receptor the limiting concentration resolution

must be δc/c

(Da¯cτ )−1/2, and if Nr receptors are distributed sparsely over the cell surface

we expect that they provide independent measurements, improving the resolution to δc/c

(DNra¯cτ )−1/2. But as Nr increases to the point where Nra

δc/c

(DR¯cτ )−1/2, presumably because of correlations among the concentration signals

∼
R, this must saturate at

∼

∼

sensed by the diﬀerent receptors.

The discussion by Berg and Purcell makes use of several special assumptions which we

suspect are not required, and this leads to some clear questions:

•

•

•

For interactions of a substrate with a single receptor, does Eq. (1) provide a general

limit to sensitivity, independent of molecular details?

Can we understand explicitly how correlations among nearby receptors result in a limit

like Eq. (1), but with a reﬂecting the size of the receptor cluster?

Do the spatial correlations among nearby receptors have an analog in the time domain,

so that there is a minimum averaging time required for noise reduction to be eﬀective?

Finally, if we can establish Eq. (1) or its generalizations as a real limit on sensitivity for any

signaling process, we would like to know if cells actually operate near this limit.

In most cases that we know about, biochemical signaling molecules are thought to inter-

act with their receptors through some kinetic process which leads to the establishment of

equilibrium between bound and unbound states. If this is the case, we can view the ﬂuctu-

ations in occupancy of a binding site as an example of thermal noise, and we can use the

ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem rather than tracing through the consequences of diﬀerent

microscopic hypotheses about the nature of the interaction between signaling molecules and

their targets. We begin with a simple example, to show that we can recover conventional

results.

II. BINDING TO A SINGLE RECEPTOR

Consider a binding site for signaling molecules, and let the fractional occupancy of the

site be n. If we do not worry about the discreteness of this one site, or about the ﬂuctuations

in concentration c of the signaling molecule, we can write a kinetic equation

This describes the kinetics whereby the system comes to equilibrium, and the free energy F

associated with binding is determined by detailed balance,

dn(t)
dt

= k+c[1

n(t)]

k−n(t).

If we imagine that thermal ﬂuctuations can lead to small changes in the rate constants, we

can linearize Eq. (2) to obtain

But from Eq. (3) we have

Applying this constraint to Eq. (4) we ﬁnd that the individual rate constant ﬂuctuations

cancel and all that remains is the ﬂuctuation in the thermodynamic binding energy δF :

ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem:

and the correlation time is given by

This is the usual result for switching in a Markovian way between two states; here it follows

from the ‘macroscopic’ kinetic equations, plus the fact that binding is an equilibrium process.

The same methods can be used in the more general case where the concentration is

allowed to ﬂuctuate. Now we write

The “self–energy” Σ(ω) is ultraviolet divergent, which can be traced to the delta function in

Eq. (18); we have assumed that the receptor is inﬁnitely small. A more realistic treatment

would give the receptor a ﬁnite size, which is equivalent to cutting oﬀ the k integrals at some

(large) Λ

which read out the receptor occupancy and average over a time τ long compared to the

correlation time τc of the noise, then the relevant quantity is the low frequency limit of the

noise spectrum. Hence,

The new τc can be written as

To relate these results back to the discussion by Berg and Purcell, we note that an overall

change in concentration is equivalent to a change in F by an amount equal to the change in

chemical potential, so that ∆c/¯c

III. BINDING TO MULTIPLE RECEPTORS

of m receptor sites at positions ~xµ:

In summary, we ﬁnd that the simple formula in Eq. (1) really does provide a general

limit on the precision of concentration measurements by sensors of linear dimension

a, at

∼

least in those cases where the interactions between the receptor and its ligand are passive.

Further, there is a minimum level of receptor occupancy noise from Eq. (30), and a minimum

correlation time from Eq. (26). Let us look at two examples to see how these limits compare

with the performance of real cellular signaling mechanisms.

IV. PHYSICAL EXAMPLES

A. Regulation of gene expression in bacteria

Expression of genes is controlled in part by the occupancy of promoter sites adjacent to

the regions of DNA which code for protein [7]. We thus can view gene expression as a readout

9

mechanism for sensing promoter site occupancy, or even as a sensor for the concentration

of the transcription factor proteins which bind to the promoter site. In a bacterium like E.

coli, transcription factors are present in NTF

100 copies in a cell of volume of

∼

1 µm3

∼

[8]. If the transcription factor is a repressor then gene expression levels are determined by

1

n, while if it is an activator then expression is related to n; because δnrms

n are determined by

Direct measurements of diﬀusion constants for small proteins in the E. Coli cytoplasm yield

3 µm2/s [9]. A promoter site itself has linear dimensions a

3 nm, and putting these

factors together we ﬁnd the crucial combination of parameters πDa¯c

∼

3 s−1. In particular

∼

this means that the ﬂuctuations in occupancy of the promoter site, averaged over a time τ ,

Recent experiments [10] indicate that E. Coli achieves

10% precision in control of gene

expression at small values of ¯A. For this performance to be consistent with the physical

limits, the transcription machinery must therefore integrate the promoter site occupancy for

times of order one minute, even assuming that the translation from occupancy to expression

level itself is noiseless. This integration can be provided by the lifetime of the mRNA

transcripts themselves, which is

3 min in prokaryotes [11].

∼

B. Control of the ﬂagellar motor by CheY

The output of bacterial chemotaxis is control of the ﬂagellar rotary motor [12]. The phos-

phorylated form of the signaling protein CheY (CheY–P) binds to the motor and modulates

the probability of clockwise versus counterclockwise rotation [13]. Recent measurements [14]

show that the probability p of clockwise rotation depends very steeply on the concentration

c of CheY–P,

rotation as a simple random telegraph process, and for c

Thus, for c

34 individual subunits to which the CheY-P molecules bind [15], from Eq. 44 we

to measure the CheY-P concentration with

5% precision within two seconds. This is in

agreement with our earlier result obtained by observing the switching statistics of the motor

to within a factor of two.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In conclusion, we have derived from statistical mechanics considerations the physical

limits to which biological sensors that rely on the binding of a diﬀusing substrate can mea-

sure its concentration. Our approach complements and extends the classic work by Berg and

11

Purcell. For a single receptor, we arrive at their earlier intuitive result, which states that the

accuracy in measurement of concentration is limited by the noise associated with the arrival

of discrete substrate molecules at the receptors. Our approach extends in a straightforward

way to multiple receptors without relying on additional considerations; for this case, our

result demonstrates more transparently the role of multiple receptors in improving the mea-

surement accuracy, as well as the saturating limit in this improvement set by the receptor

cluster size. Relevant internal or external signaling molecules are often present in low copy

numbers, and their concentration in turn regulates downstream biochemical networks crucial

to the cell’s functions. For two experimentally well-studied examples, we show that the cell’s

performance is consistent with the counting noise limits in measuring the concentration of

these signaling molecules.

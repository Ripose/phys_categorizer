The Percolation Transition in the DNA-Gold Nanoparticle System

Ching-Hwa Kiang∗ and Rona Ramos
Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095–1547

Melting and hybridization of DNA-capped gold nanoparticle networks are investigated with opti-
cal absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Single-stranded, 12-base DNA-
capped gold nanoparticles are linked with complementary, single-stranded, 24-base linker DNA to
form particle networks. Compared to free DNA, a sharp melting transition is seen in these networked
DNA-nanoparticle systems. The sharpness is explained by percolation transition phenomena.

DNA melting and hybridization phenomena are of
great importance in both fundamental biological science
and biotechnology [1, 2, 3, 4]. Sequence-speciﬁc DNA
recognition is important in detection, diagnosis of genetic
diseases, and identiﬁcation of infectious agents. Gene
chips have been widely used for detecting speciﬁc nucleic
acid sequences. More recently, DNA-modiﬁed gold parti-
cles have been used for DNA self-assembly [5, 6]. Organic
molecules between gold particles have also been demon-
strated to be useful as conducting molecular junctions
[7]. DNA-gold nanoparticle systems undergo a change
of color upon network formation, which can be used for
highly sensitive detection when speciﬁc nucleic acid se-
quences induce network formation [8, 9].
Indeed, such
a system has been demonstrated to be useful to detect
anthrax and other agents of biowarfare [10].

Our DNA-gold nanoparticle systems were prepared us-
ing modiﬁed methods based on Ref. [9]. The basic unit
is illustrated in Fig. 1. Gold nanoparticles are deriva-
tized with non-complementary, single-stranded, 12-base
DNA (
4 nm). Upon adding 24-base, complementary
linker DNA, particles aggregate to form network struc-
tures. These network structures precipitate out of the
solution, which produces a visible color change from pink
to purple [5].

The DNA-gold nanoparticle system is a model for
phase transitions. Melting of short, free DNA is not a
phase transition. However, when short DNA are bound
to gold particles, the system undergoes a phase transi-
tion because the DNA-gold particles form networks of mi-
crometer size, which is approaching a bulk phase. Thus,
the binding transition in the network is much sharper

than that of free DNA in solution, due to the coopera-
tive melting process. Many fundamental aspects of phase
transitions may be investigated with this biomolecular
system.

Here we report studies of DNA-gold nanoparticle melt-
ing transitions. We start with a range of diﬀerent sizes
of gold nanoparticles capped with either 3’ or 5’ modi-
ﬁed, single-stranded, 12-base DNA. We then add linker
DNA, which causes the nanoparticles to form a network,
and we study the melting transition by spectroscopic and
microscopic methods. Percolation transition phenomena
are observed in the DNA-gold nanoparticle system as it
aggregates.

DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles were prepared
by conjugating gold nanoparticles ranging from 10 to
40 nm in diameter (Sigma, ICN Pharmaceutical) with
thiol-modiﬁed DNA [9, 11].
3’-alkanethiol DNA 3’S-
(CH2)3-ATG-CTC-AAC-TCT was prepared by using
C3 S-S modiﬁer and 5’-alkanethiol DNA TAG-GAC-
TTA-CGC-(CH2)6-S5’ by C6 S-S on a 1 µmol scale and
puriﬁed by HPLC (Invitrogen). Just prior to conjugation
with gold, 100 nmol of the dried DNA was redispersed in
400 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 0.1 M phosphate buﬀer (pH 8) so-
lution at room temperature for 30 minutes to cleave the
disulﬁde bond. Salt was removed with a NAP-5 desalt-
ing column to avoid bare gold aggregation prior to DNA
conjugation.

The deprotected alkanethiol-modiﬁed DNA were used
to derivatize gold nanoparticles at room temperature for
24 hours to form gold nanoparticle probes. The solu-
tions were then brought to 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM phos-
phate buﬀer (pH 7) and allowed to stand for 48 hours.
To remove excess DNA, solutions were centrifuged at
13,200 rpm (16,110
G) for 60 minutes. The supernatent
was decanted, and the red precipitate was redispersed in
1 ml nanopure water and centrifuged again. After de-
canting the supernatent, about 200 µl of precipitate of
each modiﬁed gold nanoparticles were collected for spec-
troscopic investigation.

FIG. 2: Optical absorption spectra of DNA-modiﬁed gold
nanoparticles. The time starts when linker L is added to the
solution containing mixtures of gold nanoparticles modiﬁed
with D1 and D2. Owing to the particle network formation,
the 520 nm gold surface plasmon peak slowly shifts to longer
wavelength, followed by peak broadening and further shifting.

done by mixing 200 µl each modiﬁed gold nanoparticles
(0.8 OD) with 8 µl linker solution (10 pmol/µl). The so-
lution was annealed at 70 ◦C for 10 minutes and cooled
to room temperature during a 2 hour period and was
allowed to aggregate for several days.

Absorption spectra of DNA-modiﬁed gold nanoparti-
cles were taken on a Hewlett-Packard diode array spec-
trophotometer (HP8453). The kinetics of formation of
network nanoparticle structures at room temperature is
illustrated in Fig. 2. Upon adding linker DNA, gold
nanoparticles aggregate to form networks, as demon-
strated in the gold surface plasmon peak (520 nm) shift
of the DNA-modiﬁed gold nanoparticles [12, 13, 14]. The
aggregation started with the wavelength shift of the plas-
mon band, followed by broadening and more shifting of
the peak as hybridization continues. From molecular sim-
ulations it is known that change in network size results
mainly in peak broadening, whereas change in gold vol-
ume fraction results mainly in peak shifting [13]. Our
results indicate that the initial aggregation has character-
istics consistent with increasing volume fraction, followed
by increasing network size.

To study the equilibrium behavior of DNA-gold
nanoparticle system, we monitor the UV-visible spectra
absorption intensity at 260 nm and 520 nm while melt-
ing the DNA-gold nanoparticle network. DNA bases have
strong absorption at the UV region, and the peak near
260 nm is a result of combination of these electronic tran-
sition dipoles [15]. The DNA double helix has smaller
extinction coeﬃcient than single-stranded DNA due to
hypocromism and, therefore, the absorption intensity at
260 nm increases as a result of DNA melting. The sample
was heated by a peltier temperature controller (JASCO
J-715) at a rate of 0.5 ◦C/min, from 25 to 75 ◦C. The

FIG. 3: Normalized melting curves of linked gold nanoparti-
cle networks monitored at 260 nm. (a) Melting curves of dif-
ferent size particles as a function of temperature. Inset shows
the change in melting temperature, Tm, with particle diame-
ter D. Data are ﬁt with a power law. (b) Melting of particles
as a function of reduced temperature. Solid line shows the
region where data were used for curve ﬁtting, dashed line is
calculated from the equation of best ﬁt (see text). The scal-
ing shows the universality of the melting transition above the
transition temperatures.

260 nm and 520 nm melting curves are very similar, in-
dicating that DNA and nanoparticle melting are closely
related. Figure 3a displays the melting curves of 10 nm,
20 nm, and 40 nm gold particles with linker DNA. The
melting transition width (FWHM) is about 5◦C, com-
pared to 12◦C for melting of free DNA [8]. As illustrated
in the ﬁgure, the transition width as well as the melting
temperature Tm of DNA have been dramatically modi-
ﬁed by the binding to gold particles.

The melting temperature Tm, deﬁned as the tempera-
ture at the midpoint of the absorbance transition [16], is
found to be a function of particle diameter, D, and the
data are ﬁtted to Tm(◦C) = 68
57/√D. The surface
coverage of thiol-capped DNA bound to gold nanoparti-

−

cles has been determined via the ﬂuorescence method to
be approximately 160 DNA (12-mer) bound for a 16 nm
diameter particle [17]. Assuming the number of DNA
bound to gold particles scales with the particle surface
area, D2, there are 50, 190, and 750 DNA on 10 nm,
20 nm, and 40 nm particles, respectively. An increas-
ing number of connections between particles as the gold
particle size increases is expected. Since the hydrogen
bonding energy per DNA pair remain the same, an in-
creased number of connections eﬀectively increases the
enthalpy, ∆H, between particles and, therefore, raises
the melting temperature Tm.

For short DNA (12–14 base pairs), melting and hy-
bridization can be described by a two-state model as an
equilibrium between single- and double-stranded DNA
[16], S + S ⇀↽ D. The melting curve is a slowly vary-
ing function of temperature and can be described by the
van’t Hoﬀ relationship [15]. While short, free DNA does
not exhibit a phase transition, DNA bound to nanopar-
ticles aggregate to form networks that have a deﬁnite
phase transition, and the melting curves cannot be de-
scribed with the van’t Hoﬀ relationship.

Figure 3b illustrates two diﬀerent transitions at high
T and low T . The absorption of DNA-modiﬁed, 10 nm,
20 nm, and 40 nm gold nanoparticles are plotted versus
reduced temperatures (TR = T /Tm). Above temperature
Tm (low connectivity), the curves appear insensitive to
details, indicative of universal scaling at the percolation
transition [18]. The curves can be ﬁtted with an equation
that describes percolation phenomena,

A(TR) = 1

a(Tc

TR)β

−

−
where A(TR) is the absorption as a function of reduced
temperature TR, and β is the critical exponent for perco-
lation. In three-dimensions, β = 0.403 [19]. The parame-
ters a and Tc are adjustable. Using the data for all three
particle sizes for 1 < TR < 1.003, we obtained a=4.079
and Tc=1.005, as shown in Fig. 3b. The deviation from
the ﬁt above Tc is presumably due to ﬁnite size eﬀects
[20].

The ﬁtted curve demonstrates that the transition
from single- to double stranded DNA in the DNA-gold
nanoparticle system can be explained by percolation.
Percolation phenomena occur when the gold particles
make enough connections to other gold particles, and net-
works of nearly inﬁnite clusters form [19, 21]. Gold parti-
cles make more connections at lower T because there are
more hydrogen bonds between the double helix at lower
T , therefore, percolation begins to occur at lower T . The
equilibrium constant, Keq for reaction S + S ⇀↽ D, is
analogous to the probability of a bond in the ”bond per-
colation” model.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of DNA-
modiﬁed, 10 nm gold particle systems at various stages of
growth are shown in Fig. 4. TEM samples were prepared
by letting 5 µl of solution containing particles dry on a

systems that involve DNA. This is a new system, about
which relatively little is known. Many parameters, such
as the length of DNA, particle size, degree of disorder,
solution pH value, and salt concentration, may be varied
to better understand the system.

FIG. 5: Growth mechanism of the DNA-gold nanoparticle
network. When linker DNA is added, hybridization occurs,
connecting the gold nanoparticle into porous networks. As
the cluster grows, the volume fraction and the size of the
cluster continue to increase. The transition between dispersed

cooperative phenomenon [22], much like a phase transition.

of the low temperature (room temperature) structure,
which formed dense networks.

The growth mechanism of the DNA-gold nanoparticle
network is illustrated in Figure 5. Particles initially are
dissolved in the solution. With the addition of comple-
mentary linker DNA, hybridization occurs, and the par-
ticles form a network-like structure. The volume fraction
of the porous structure continues to increase past the per-
colation threshold, and eventually the clusters become a
dense amorphous structure.

In conclusion, the network formation in DNA-gold par-
ticle systems exhibits a phase transition, which does not
occur for short DNA. Our results provide detailed and
precise measurements of hybridization/melting of the
DNA-gold nanoparticle system. DNA attached to gold is
a controlled system in which to do experiments on phase

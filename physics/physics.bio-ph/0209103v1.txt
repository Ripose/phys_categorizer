Abstract

Using data from gene expression databases on various organisms and tissues, including yeast,

nematodes, human normal and cancer tissues, and embryonic stem cells, we found that the abun-

dances of expressed genes exhibit a power-law distribution with an exponent close to -1, i.e., they

obey Zipf’s law. Furthermore, by simulations of a simple model with an intra-cellular reaction

network, we found that Zipf’s law of chemical abundance is a universal feature of cells where such

a network optimizes the eﬃciency and faithfulness of self-reproduction. These ﬁndings provide

novel insights into the nature of the organization of reaction dynamics in living cells.

In a cell, an enormous number of organized chemical reactions are required to maintain

its living state. Although enumeration of detailed cellular processes and the construction of

complicated models is important for a complete description of cellular behavior, it is also

necessary to search for universal laws with regard to the intra-cellular reactions common to

all living systems, and then to unravel the logic of life leading to such universal features. For

example, scale-free networks have recently been discussed as a universal property of some

biochemical reaction networks within existing organisms [1, 2]. These studies, however, only

focused on the properties of the network topologies, while the reaction dynamics of the

networks were not discussed. Here, we report a universal property of the reaction dynamics

that occurs within cells, namely a power-law distribution of the abundance of expressed

genes with an exponent close to -1, i.e. a power-law distribution that obeys Zipf’s law

[3]. By using an abstract model of a cell with simple reaction dynamics, we show that

this power-law behavior in the chemical abundances generally appears when the reaction

dynamics leads to a faithful and eﬃcient self-reproduction of a cell. These ﬁndings provide

insights into the nature of the organization of complex reaction dynamics in living cells.

In order to investigate possible universal properties of the reaction dynamics, we examined

the distributions of the abundances of expressed genes (that are approximately equal to the

abundances of the corresponding proteins) in 6 organisms and more than 40 tissues based on

data publicly available from SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) databases [4, 5, 6].

SAGE allows the number of copies of any given mRNA to be quantitatively evaluated by

determining the abundances of the short sequence tags which uniquely identify it [7].

In Fig.1, we show the rank-ordered frequency distributions of the expressed genes, where

the ordinate indicates the frequency of the observed sequence tags (i.e. the population ratio

of the corresponding mRNA to the total mRNA), and the abscissa shows the rank determined

from this frequency. As shown, the distributions follow a power-law with an exponent close

to -1 (Zipf’s law). We observed this power-law distribution for all the available samples,

including 18 human normal tissues, human cancer tissues, mouse (including embryonic stem

cells), rat, nematode (C. elegans), and yeast (S.cerevisiae) cells. All the data over 40 samples

(except for 2 plant data) show the power-law distributions with the exponent in the range

from −1 ∼ −0.86. Even though there are some factors which may bias the results of the

SAGE experiments, such as sequencing errors and non-uniqueness of tag sequences, it seems

rather unlikely that the distribution is an artifact of the experimental procedure.

2

The abundance of each protein is the result of a complex network of chemical reactions

that is inﬂuenced by possibly a large number of factors including other proteins and genes.

Then, why is Zipf’s law universally observed, and what class of reaction dynamics will show

the observed power-law distribution? Because the power-law distribution applies to a wide

range of existing organisms, it is expected that it appears as a general feature of the reaction

dynamics of cellular systems.

In order to investigate the above questions, we adopt a simple model of cellular dynamics

that captures only its basic features. It consists of intra-cellular catalytic reaction networks

that transform nutrient chemicals into proteins. By studying a class of simple models with

these features, we clarify the conditions under which the reaction dynamics leads to a power-

law distribution of the chemical abundances.

Of course, real intra-cellular processes are much more complicated, but if the mechanism

is universal, the power-law should be valid regardless of how complicated the actual processes

are. Hence it is relevant to study as simple as possible a model when trying to understand

a universal law in real data.

Consider a cell consisting of a variety of chemicals. The internal state of the cell can

be represented by a set of numbers (n1, n2, · · · , nk), where ni is the number of molecules of

the chemical species i with i ranging from i = 1 to k. For the internal chemical reaction

dynamics, we chose a catalytic network among these k chemical species, where each reaction

from some chemical i to some other chemical j is assumed to be catalyzed by a third chemical

ℓ, i.e. (i + ℓ → j + ℓ) . The rate of increase of nj (and decrease of ni) through this reaction is
given by ǫninℓ/N 2, where ǫ is the coeﬃcient for the chemical reaction. For simplicity all the

reaction coeﬃcients were chosen to be equal [8], and the connection paths of this catalytic

network were chosen randomly such that the probability of any two chemicals i and j to be

connected is given by the connection rate ρ [9].

Some resources (nutrients) are supplied from the environment by diﬀusion through the

membrane (with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient D), to ensure the growth of a cell. Through the

calaytic reactions, these nutrients[10] are transformed into other chemicals. Some of these

chemicals may penetrate [8] the membrane and diﬀuse out while others will not. With

the synthesis of the unpenetrable chemicals that do not diﬀuse out, the total number of

chemicals N = Pi ni in a cell can increase, and accordingly the cell volume will increase.
We study how this cell growth is sustained by dividing a cell into two when the volume is

3

larger than some threshold. For simplicity the division is assumed to occur when the total

number of molecules N = Pi ni in a cell exceeds a given threshold Nmax. Chosen randomly,
the mother cell’s molecules are evenly split among the two daughter cells.

In our numerical simulations, we randomly pick up a pair of molecules in a cell, and

transform them according to the reaction network. In the same way, diﬀusion through the

membrane is also computed by randomly choosing molecules inside the cell and nutrients in

the environment. In the case with N ≫ k (i.e. continuous limit), the reaction dynamics is

represented by the following rate equation:

dni/dt = X
j,ℓ

Con(j, i, ℓ) ǫ nj nℓ/N 2

Con(i, j′, ℓ′) ǫ ni nℓ′/N 2 + Dσi(ni/V − ni/N),

− X
j′,ℓ′

where Con(i, j, ℓ) is 1 if there is a reaction i + ℓ → j + ℓ, and 0 otherwise, whereas σi takes

1 if the chemical i is penetrable, and 0 otherwise. The third term describes the transport

of chemicals through the membrane, where ni is a constant, representing the number of the

i-th chemical species in the environment and V denotes the volume of the environment in

units of the initial cell size. The number ni is nonzero only for the nutrient chemicals.

If the total number of molecules Nmax is larger than the number of chemical species

k, the population ratios {ni/N} are generally ﬁxed, since the daughter cells inherit the

chemical compositions of their mother cells. For k > Nmax [11], the population ratios do

not settle down and can change from generation to generation. In both cases, depending on

the membrane diﬀusion coeﬃcient D, the intra-cellular reaction dynamics can be classiﬁed

into the three classes [12].

First, there is a critical value D = Dc beyond which the cell cannot grow continuously.

When D > Dc, the ﬂow of nutrients from the environment is so fast that the internal

reactions transforming them into chemicals sustaining ‘metabolism’ cannot keep up. In this

case all the molecules in the cell will ﬁnally be substituted by the nutrient chemicals and

the cell stops growing since the nutrients alone cannot catalyze any reactions to generate

unpenetrable chemicals. Continuous cellular growth and successive divisions are possible

only for D ≤ Dc. When the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D is suﬃciently small, the internal reactions

progress faster than the ﬂow of nutrients from the environment, and all the existing chemical

4

species have small numbers of approximately the same level. A stable reaction network

organization is obtained only at the intermediate diﬀusion coeﬃcient below Dc, where some

chemical species have much larger number of molecules than others.

The rank-ordered number distributions of chemical species in our model are plotted in

Fig.2, where the ordinate indicates the number of molecules ni and abscissa shows the rank

determined by ni. As shown in the ﬁgure, the slope in the rank-ordered number distribution

increases with an increase of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D. We found that at the critical point

D = Dc, the distribution converges to a power-law with an exponent -1.

The power-law distribution at this critical point is maintained by a hierarchical organi-

zation of catalytic reactions, where the synthesis of higher ranking chemicals is catalyzed

by lower ranking chemicals. For example, major chemical species (with e.g. ni > 1000)

are directly synthesized from nutrients and catalyzed by chemicals that are slightly less

abundant (e.g. ni ∼ 200). The latter chemicals are mostly synthesized from nutrients (or

other major chemicals), and catalyzed by chemicals that are much less abundant. In turn

these chemicals are catalyzed by chemicals that are even less abundant, and this hierarchy

of catalytic reactions continues until it reaches the minor chemical species (with e.g. ni < 5)

[13].

Based on this catalytic hierarchy, the observed exponent -1 can be explained using a

mean ﬁeld approximation. First, we replace the concentration ni/N of each chemical i,

except the nutrient chemicals, by a single average concentration (mean ﬁeld) x, while the
concentrations of nutrient chemicals S is given by the average concentration S = 1 − k∗x,
where k∗ is the number of non-nutrient chemical species. From this mean ﬁeld equation, we
obtain S = DS0
is stable if D < ǫρ

D+ǫρ with S0 = Pj nj/V . With linear stability analysis, the solution with S 6= 1
S0−1 ≡ Dc. Indeed, this critical value does not diﬀer much from numerical

observation.

Next, we study how the concentrations of non-nutrient chemicals diﬀerentiate. Suppose

that chemicals {i0} are synthesized directly from nutrients through catalyzation by chemicals

j. As the next step of the mean-ﬁeld approximation we assume the concentrations of the

chemicals {i0} are larger than the others. Now we represent the dynamics by two mean-ﬁeld

concentrations; the concentration of {i0} chemicals, x0, and the concentration of the others,

x1. The solution with x0 6= x1 satisﬁes x0 ≈ x1/ρ at the critical point Dc. Since the fraction

of the {i0} chemicals among the non-nutrient chemicals is ρ, the relative abundance of the

5

chemicals {i0} is inversely proportional to this fraction. Similarly, one can compute the

relative abundances of the chemicals of the next layer synthesized from i0. At D ≈ Dc, this

hierarchy of the catalytic network is continued. In general a given layer of the hierarchy is

deﬁned by the chemicals whose synthesis from the nutrients is catalyzed by the layer one

step down in the hierarchy. The abundance of chemical species in a given layer is 1/ρ times

larger than chemicals in the layer one step down. Then, in the same way as this hierarchical

organization of chemicals, the increase of chemical abundances and the decrease of number

of chemical species are given by factors of 1/ρ and ρ, respectively. This is the reason for the

emergence of power-law with an exponent -1 in the rank-ordered distribution [14].

In general, as the ﬂow of nutrients from the environment increases, the hierarchical cat-

alyzation network pops up from random reaction networks. This hierarchy continues until

it covers all chemicals, at D → Dc − 0. Hence, the emergence of a power-law distribution

of chemical abundances near the critical point is quite general, and does not rely on the

details of our model, such as the network conﬁguration or the kinetic rules of the reactions.

Instead it is a universal property of a cell with an intra-cellular reaction network to grow, by

taking in nutrients, at the critical state, as has been conﬁrmed from simulations of a variety

of models.

There are two reasons to assume that such a critical state of the reaction dynamics is

adopted in existing cellular systems. First, as shown in Fig.3, the growth speed of a cell is

maximal at D = Dc. This suggests that a cell whose reaction dynamics are in the critical

state should be selected by natural selection. Second, at the critical point, the similarity

of chemical compositions between the mother and daughter cell is maximal as shown in

Fig.3. Indeed, for k > N, the chemical compositions diﬀer signiﬁcantly from generation to

generation when D ≪ Dc. When D ≈ Dc, several semi-stable states with distinct chemical

compositions appear. Daughter cells in the semi-stable states inherit chemical compositions

that are nearly identical to their mother cells over many generations, until ﬂuctuations in

molecule numbers induce a transition to another semi-stable state. This means that the

most faithful transfer of the information determining a cell’s intra-cellular state is at the

critical state. (Inheritance of chemical compositions is also discussed in [16] in connection

with the origin of reproducing cells). In this state, cells of speciﬁc chemical compositions

are reproduced and can also ’evolve’ into other states. For these reasons, it is natural to

conclude that evolution favors a critical state [15] for the reaction dynamics.

6

Last, we investigated the relationship between the abundance of a chemical species and

the number of reaction paths connected with it. By comparing the SAGE data and the

protein-protein interaction data in yeast (S.cerevisiae) [17, 18], obtained by systematic two-

hybrid analysis, we found that there is a signiﬁcant negative correlation between the abun-

dance of any given mRNA and the number of protein-protein interaction links that the

corresponding protein takes part in (p < 0.01; determined by randomization test). In our

model simulations, this negative correlation between the abundance of chemical species and

the number of possible catalytic paths of the chemical is also found. In this sense, chemicals

minor in abundance can play a relatively important role in the control of the behavior of a

cell[19]. In the future it will be important to study this kind of interplay in the context of

evolution since the evolution of reaction networks has only been discussed in the context of

network topology [1, 2].

and N. H. Packard, Physica D 22D, 50 (1986). In contrast to these studies, auto-catalytic

reactions are not relevant to the present study.

[10] The nutrient chemicals have no catalytic activity in order to prevent the occurrence of catalytic

reactions in the environment.

[11] Note that, in the case k > Nmax the number of some chemical species ni is 0, while a sub-

population of chemical species sustains the intra-cellular dynamics.

[12] These three classes of intra-cellular dynamics also appear when changing the connection rate

ρ. There is a critical value ρ = ρc, where in the case ρ < ρc the cell stops growing. The

power-law distribution of chemical abundances with an exponent -1 appears at ρ = ρc.

[13] In the case depicted in Fig.2, a hierarchical organization of catalytic reactions with 5 ∼ 6

layers is observed at the critical point.

[14] Within a given layer, a further hierarchy exists, which again leads to the Zipf rank distribution.

We consider a model system of two coupled Hopﬁeld neurons, which is described by delay diﬀer-
ential equations taking into account the ﬁnite signal propagation and processing times. When the
delay exceeds a critical value, a limit cycle emerges via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. First, we
calculate its frequency and trajectory perturbatively by applying the Poincar´e-Lindstedt method.
Then, the perturbation series are resummed by means of the Shohat expansion in good agreement
with numerical values. However, with increasing delay, the accuracy of the results from the Shohat
expansion worsens. We thus apply variational perturbation theory (VPT) to the perturbation ex-
pansions to obtain more accurate results, which moreover hold even in the limit of large delays.

INTRODUCTION

Feedback in biological systems has received increased
attention in recent years [1]. In particular, the role of de-
layed recurrent loops in models of population dynamics,
epidemiology, physiology, immunology, neural networks,
and cell kinetics has been studied extensively [2]. Neural
network systems are complex and large-scale nonlinear
dynamical systems, and the dynamics of a delayed net-
work are yet richer and more complicated [3]. Hopﬁeld
[4] proposed a simpliﬁed model of a neural network in
which each neuron is represented by a linear circuit con-
sisting of a resistor and a capacitor, coupled to other neu-
rons via nonlinear sigmoidal activation functions. From
this model, he derived a system of ﬁrst-order ordinary
diﬀerential equations to describe the network dynamics.
Extending Hopﬁeld’s model, Marcus and Westervelt [5]
considered the eﬀect of including a temporal delay in the
model to account for ﬁnite propagation and signal pro-
cessing times.

In networks of real neurons, delays occur at the synap-
tic level due to transmitter release dynamics and the
integration time of post-synaptic potentials at the den-
dritic tree level where post-synaptic potentials have a
ﬁnite conduction speed to the soma, and in the axons
due to the ﬁnite axonal conduction speed of action po-
tentials [6]. It is well-known that time delay can cause
an otherwise stable system to oscillate [7, 8, 9] and may
lead to bifurcation scenarios resulting in chaotic dynam-
ics [10, 11]. On the other hand, delayed feedback permits
the control of chaos [12], where it can be used to stabi-
lize unstable periodic orbits in chaotic attractors [13, 14].
Experimentally, time-delayed chaos control was success-
fully applied, for instance, to electronic oscillators [15],

mechanical pendula [16], lasers [17], and chemical sys-
tems [18]. Furthermore, a recently proposed scheme for
the treatment of neurological disorders employs delayed
feedback in order to eﬃciently desynchronize the activ-
ity of oscillatory neurons [19]. Therefore, ﬁnite delays are
an essential property of any realistic model of a neuron
population [20].

In the vast majority of cases, information about a phys-
ical system can only be obtained by means of numerical
or analytical approximation methods. Numerical meth-
ods constitute a powerful and eﬀective tool to describe
even extremely complicated physical scenarios. Never-
theless, their accuracy is not always superior to that of
analytical approximations, and usually more insight into
the physical principles that govern the system is obtained
by pursuing an analytical approach. Often, perturbation
expansions are easily accessible, but they are usually di-
vergent and need resummation. A recently developed,
powerful method to perform such a resummation is vari-
ational perturbation theory (VPT), which has been suc-
cessfully applied in various quantum or statistical ﬁeld
theories [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. A ﬁrst application of VPT
in the ﬁeld of deterministic nonlinear dynamics is found
in Ref. [26], while the present work extends the use of
VPT for the ﬁrst time to a system described by delay
diﬀerential equations (DDE’s).

In Sec. II, we introduce the two-neuron model and the
system of DDE’s that we consider. The results of a lin-
ear stability analysis of the model system are reported in
Sec. III, and it is shown that a limit cycle emerges via a
supercritical Hopf bifurcation when the delay exceeds a
critical value. In Sec. IV, the Poincar´e-Lindstedt Method
is applied to derive the perturbation expansions for the
delay-induced limit cycle and its angular frequency. In
Sec. V, we apply the Shohat expansion to the perturba-
tion series of the limit cycle and its angular frequency
as a ﬁrst crude resummation approach. In Sec. VI, we
resum the perturbation expansions using VPT, which al-
lows us to improve the quality of our results signiﬁcantly
and to obtain results which are reasonable even in the

II. MODEL

Neural circuits composed of two or three neurons form
the basic feedback mechanisms involved in the regulation
of neural activity [20]. Many researchers have used bifur-
cation analysis and numerical simulations in order to ana-
lyze a system of two Hopﬁeld-like neurons with discrete or
distributed time delays [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35].
In this investigation, we apply analytical approximation
methods to a two-neuron system with delay, described
by the coupled ﬁrst-order DDE’s

Here, u1 and u2 denote the voltages of the Hopﬁeld neu-
rons and τ (1) and τ (2) are the signal propagation or pro-
cessing time delays, while a1 and a2 describe the cou-
plings between the two neurons.

III. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

The system of DDE’s (1), (2) has a trivial stationary
point at u1 = u2 = 0 and we ﬁrst analyze its stability.
Near the equilibrium point, linearizing the DDE system
yields

in the last equation, where λ is a complex number, and
c1 and c2 are constants, we get a nontrivial solution if
and only if

If τ > τ0, then the zero solution of (1), (2) is asymp-
totically unstable.

τj , with j = 0, 1, 2 . . ., are Hopf bifurcation values
of (1), (2).

Furthermore, Theorem 3 in Ref. [28] states that the Hopf
bifurcation at τ = τ0 is supercritical. Note that iω0 is
the solution to (6) when τ = τ0, and the period of the
limit cycle at the Hopf bifurcation is thus T0 = 2π/ω0.

the critical value τ0 of the delay τ no periodic solution
exists, while above τ = τ0 there is such a solution. We
now consider the case τ (1) = τ (2) = τ , a1a2 ≤ −
2 and
seek to calculate the period and trajectory of the pe-
riodic solution approximatively. To this end, we apply
the Poincar´e-Lindstedt method [36]. Since a supercriti-
cal Hopf bifurcation occurs at τ = τ0, we assume that
the amplitude and frequency of the new periodic states
are analytic in ǫ = √τ

τ0 and expand them as

It is convenient to rescale the argument of these functions
so that they become periodic with period 2π. We thus
introduce the new independent variable ξ according to

ξ = ω(ǫ)t ,

(10)

and we write

Applying the perturbation expansion (8) to the system

Imposing the initial conditions V (0)

The periodic solution V(ξ) to (12), (13) can only be de-
termined up to an arbitrary phase. Without loss of gen-
erality we can thus choose B0 = 0 in (20), (21), which
ﬁxes the phase of the zeroth order solution, at least up
to a shift of π.

where the inhomogeneity f (n)(ξ) is determined by the
solutions to previous orders. Since we require that the
solution V(n)(ξ) be periodic in ξ with period 2π, we can
impose certain conditions on the inhomogeneity f (n)(ξ).
Namely, we demand that f (n)(ξ) not contain terms that
would lead to non-periodic solutions for V(n)(ξ),
i.e.,
f (n)(ξ) must not contain secular terms. In order to iden-
tify the conditions that must be satisﬁed by f (n)(ξ), we
expand V(n)(ξ) and f (n)(ξ) as Fourier series:

We must thus have either A0 = 0 or ω1 = 0.
If we
choose A0 = 0, we only obtain the trivial solution. Thus,
we choose ω1 = 0, and the coeﬃcient A0 is yet to be
determined. The solution for V(1)(ξ) is then simply given
by the solution to the homogeneous system:

the coeﬃcient A2(n−1) and the correction ω2n from the

Table I shows the ﬁrst eight nonvanishing corrections to
the angular frequency. Note that the signs of the ex-
pansion coeﬃcients ωn alternate and that their absolute
value grows rapidly. This indicates that the perturba-
tion series for ω is a divergent Borel series. Table II
shows the expansion coeﬃcients of the ﬁrst two nonvan-
ishing orders of the Fourier expansion of the limit cycle
as given by (24). Figure 2 a) shows the ﬁrst eight orders

Choosing the sign of A0 to be positive ﬁxes the phase
of our zeroth order solution deﬁnitively. This procedure
can easily be carried to higher orders, where only even

as a function of ǫ. Note that odd and even perturba-
tion orders yield results which are respectively smaller
and larger than the numerical values. For small values
of the delay, the perturbative solution is in good agree-
ment with the numerical data. However, as ǫ grows, the
perturbative solution becomes unacceptable. Figure 2 b)

where we count the order N of our perturbation expan-
sion such that in the N th order we obtain the N th nonva-
nishing corrections ω2N and V(2(N −1))(ξ). For the value
ǫ = 1 chosen in Fig. 2 b), the limit cycle can still be ob-
tained with good precision from the perturbation series
(58) and as in the case of the angular frequency we ob-
serve that the perturbative approximations approach the
numerical result in an alternating manner. However, as ǫ
increases, the perturbative solution (58) becomes useless
as in the case of the angular frequency. Thus, if we want
to obtain analytical results for larger values of the tem-
poral delay τ , we must resum our perturbation series. In
the next section, we apply a Shohat transformation to
the perturbative results for both the angular frequency
ω(N ) and the limit cycle u(N )(t).

V. SHOHAT EXPANSION

Now, we resum our perturbative results by performing
a Shohat expansion. This method was ﬁrst introduced
for calculating the period of a Van der Pol oscillator in
Ref. [37] and it has been conjectured that the expansion
yields results which are valid for all values of the per-
turbation parameter [37, 38]. Furthermore, it has been
stated that the Shohat expansion is succesful when the
periodic solution to the diﬀerential equation in question is
of softening type, i.e., the angular frequency ω decreases
with ǫ [39], which is the case for our system as is evident
from Fig. 2 a).

The basic idea of the Shohat expansion is to map the
) to a new parameter
[0,
perturbation parameter ǫ
µ
[0, 1). In order to perform the resummation of the
angular frequency, we introduce the new expansion pa-
rameter µ according to the transformation suggested by

∞

∈

∈

Shohat in Ref. [37] and thus set

µ =

ǫ2
1 + ǫ2 ,
where we explicitly take into account that the pertur-
bation series for the angular frequency depends only on
even powers of ǫ. Inverting (59), we have

(59)

ǫ2 =

µ

.

µ

1

(60)

−
We now obtain the Shohat expansion of our perturbative
result by replacing ǫ2 in (57) according to the last identity
and re-expanding the series in µ up to order µN . The
Shohat expansion of the angular frequency is thus given
by

Finally, in order to evaluate the resummed angular fre-
quency and limit cycle for a certain value of ǫ, we replace
µ in (61) and (62) according to (59).

Figure 3 a) shows the angular frequency after Shohat
resummation as a function of the delay parameter ǫ. We
ﬁnd that, if we go to suﬃciently high orders, the re-
summed expansion yields reasonably good results for all
values of ǫ. Figure 3 b) shows an example of the limit
cycle after resummation. Note that for the value of the

Figure 4 a) shows the convergence of the angular fre-

ral delay. For small values of the delay, the convergence
seems to be exponentially fast, at least up to the eighth
order. For larger delays, the convergence appears to be
less regular. In order to examine the convergence of the
limit cycle results, we consider the error measure

where we rescale the argument of our analytic solution so
that its period is identical to the period of the numerical
solution and shift the phase of the analytic solution ac-
cording to the phase of the numerical solution. Figure 4
b) shows the convergence of the results for the limit cy-
cle. As in the case of the angular frequency, the results
from the Shohat expansion and their convergence with
the perturbation order are best as long as the delay is
not too large. In the next section, we thus use a more ef-
ﬁcient method to resum the perturbation series. It yields
accurate results already in low orders, allows us to ob-
tain more precise results, and its convergence depends
less crucially on the size of the delay parameter.

VI. VARIATIONAL PERTURBATION THEORY

In this section, we improve the resummation of the per-
turbation series of the angular frequency and the limit cy-
cle by applying VPT to the perturbation series (57) and

(58). This method is based on a variational approach due
to Feynman and Kleinert [21], which has been system-
atically extended to the nonperturbative approximation
scheme now called VPT [22, 23, 24, 25].

A. Basic Principles

VPT is capable of converting divergent weak-coupling
into convergent strong-coupling expansions and has been
applied successfully in various ﬁelds, such as quan-
tum mechanics, quantum statistics, condensed matter
physics, and the theory of critical phenomena. In fact,
the most accurate critical exponents come from this the-
ory [40], as veriﬁed by recent satellite experiments [41].
First applications of VPT in the ﬁeld of Markov processes
and nonlinear dynamics are found in Refs. [47, 48] and
Ref. [11], respectively.

The convergence of VPT has been analyzed up to very
high orders for the ground-state energy of the anhar-
monic oscillator

V (x) =

ω2x2 + gx4

(64)

1
2

and was found to be exponentially fast [42, 43]. This
surprising result has been conﬁrmed later by studying
other physical systems and was proven to hold in general
[23, 24]. Furthermore, the exponential convergence seems
to be uniform with respect to other system parameters.
The variational resummation of perturbation series thus
yields approximations which are generically reasonable
for all temperatures [44, 45], space and time coordinates
[46, 47, 48], magnetic ﬁeld strengths [49], coupling con-
stants [26, 50, 51], spatial dimensions [52], etc.

VPT permits the evaluation of a divergent series of the

We now resum the angular frequency (57) using VPT.
To this end, we have to determine the growth param-
eters p and q in (66), which we achieve by analyzing
our numerical data in two steps. First, we plot our
τ0 in a log-log
numerical results for ω versus g = τ
plot. Fitting our data for log ω to a function of the
form f (log g) = p/q log g + log b0 we ﬁnd p/q =
0.9997
and b0 = 1.565. We expect the growth parameters to
1. For large delays,
be integers and thus set p/q =
the leading asymptotic behavior of ω is thus given by
ω
In order to determine not only the ratio of
p to q but the individual values of the growth param-
eters, we then ﬁt our data for gω to a function of the
form f (g−2) = b0 + b1g−2/q which yields: b0 = 1.571,
2.7, and q = 1.993. Thus, we assume q = 2 and
b1 =
from our previous result we then have p =
2. In order
to determine b0 and b1 numerically with better accuracy,
we can now perform a hierarchy of approximations to
order M by ﬁtting gω to functions of the form

g−1.

The series (71) is truncated after k = N

[53], i.e., one evaluates the function (73) at that value

tremum or turning point. In the following, we set g = ǫ2
in (57) and (58).

FIG. 5: Angular frequency and limit cycle from VPT. In a) the angular frequency as given by (84) is shown as a function of
ǫ for the orders N = 1, 2, 8 of VPT (orders three through seven would lie very close to the curve for N = 8). Dots represent
numerical values. The inset shows a magniﬁcation of the interval 4.8
5. In b) the limit cycle is shown for ǫ = 2. Dashed
lines represent the results from VPT as given by (100). The numerical result is shown by the solid line.

Since this has no real extremum in the variational pa-
rameter K, we look for roots of the second derivative.

In general, in order to optimize the inﬂuence of the
variational parameter, we ﬁrst look for minima or max-
ima of ω(N )
VPT(g, K), and if those do not exist, for positive
roots of higher derivatives.
In each order N , the op-
timized variational parameter K (N ) is thus determined
from the condition

It thus turns out that the second order approximation
for the leading and subleading large-delay coeﬃcient is
actually worse than the ﬁrst order one. However, the
results in higher orders turn out to be improved approx-
imations. For ﬁxed values of the coupling constant, the
procedure in higher orders is analogous to the ﬁrst and
second order, where the roots of the ﬁrst, second, or third
derivative of ω(N )
VPT(g, K) have to be determined numer-
ically. Furthermore, in order to obtain the coeﬃcients

in order to carry out the optimization procedure.

Fig. 5 a) shows our VPT results for the angular fre-
quency versus the delay parameter ǫ. The ﬁrst order
result is already in good agreement with the numerical
results for a wide range of delays and is far superior to
the ﬁrst order result from the Shohat expansion (com-
pare Fig. 3 a)). Figure 6 a) shows the convergence of
our VPT results for ﬁve diﬀerent values of the delay.
The accuracy of our VPT results improves with increas-
ing order; however, not as regularly as in the case of the
Shohat expansion for small delays. Figure 7 a) shows
a comparison of the eighth order results obtained from
Shohat resummation and VPT. In particular, for larger
values of the delay, the results from VPT are far superior
to the ones from Shohat resummation. Table III shows
our results for the leading large-delay coeﬃcients b0 and
the subleading coeﬃcient b1; again, the convergence is
not montonic, but we do observe a general trend towards
improved results in higher orders.

C. Resummation of the Limit Cycle

the limit cycle reads:

tion of the limit cycle following the approach of Ref. [54].

Instead of optimizing (98) and (99) according to the prin-
ciple of minimal sensitivity, we obtain our VPT result for
the limit cycle more easily by evaluating all Fourier ex-
pansion coeﬃcients for that value of the variational pa-
rameter K which was determined through the optimiza-
tion procedure of the frequency, i.e., our VPT result for

where K (N −1) is determined from the condition (83) and
we use K (N −1) instead of K (N ), since the N th term in

As an example, we consider the lowest order in which
we can perform the VPT resummation of the limit cycle.

The procedure in higher order is analogous. Figure 5 b)
shows our VPT results for the limit cycle for ǫ = 2 up
to the eighth order. Figure 6 b) shows the logarithm of
the error measure (63) for the VPT limit cycle versus
the order N for diﬀerent values of ǫ. In Fig. 7 b) the
accuracy of the eighth order results from the Shohat
expansion and VPT are compared. Again, we ﬁnd that
our VPT results are more reliable than those from the
Shohat expansion, especially for larger delays.

VII. SUMMARY

We have performed a perturbative calculation of the
limit cycle and its frequency in a two-neuron model
with delay. A Shohat resummation of the respective
perturbation expansions yields results which are in good
agreement with numerical values but whose accuracy
decreases drastically with larger values of the delay
parameter. Resumming the perturbation series with
VPT yields more uniformly converging results, which are
reliable even in low orders, and furthermore permits the
extraction of the leading large-delay behavior with suf-
ﬁcient accuracy. The present work constitutes the ﬁrst
application of VPT to a system of DDE’s. Moreover,
it establishes a method for the variational resummation
of perturbatively calculated limit cycles in nonlinear
dynamical systems.

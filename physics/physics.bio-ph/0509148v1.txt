We study the inﬂuence of disorder in the helical actin structure on the myosin V step size,
predicted from the elastic lever arm model. We show that ﬂuctuations of ±5 degrees per actin
subunit, as proposed by Egelman et al., signiﬁcantly alter the distribution of step sizes and improve
the agreement with experimental data.

Introduction

Myosin V is a motor protein from the myosin superfam-
ily, involved in various intracellular transport processes
[1]. It is a processive motor [2], which means that a sin-
gle protein molecule can transport cargoes along actin
ﬁlaments over distances of several micrometers.
It is
dimeric, consisting of two identical heads, each attached
to a lever arm, joined with each other through a tail do-
main. It achieves processivity by alternately binding its
two heads to an actin ﬁlament and thus walking in a
hand-over-hand fashion [3]. Its step size is roughly de-
termined by the periodicity of the actin ﬁlament, which
is about 36 nm.

In comparison with muscle myosin (myosin II), two
major adaptations are found in myosin V: a longer lever-
arm, measuring around 26 nm [4] and a slower release of
ADP. The duty cycle of each head is otherwise similar
[5]: the head binds to actin in the ADP.Pi state, ﬁrst
releases Pi and performs a large conformational change
(power stroke), then releases ADP and performs a smaller
conformational change, and ﬁnally binds a new ATP
molecule and detaches from actin.

In a recent article [6], we have developed a model for
myosin V, based on the elasticity of the lever arm.
It
assumes that the lever arm is stiﬄy anchored in the
head, but the direction depends on the chemical state
of that head. The distal ends of the lever arms are con-
nected together through a ﬂexible hinge, which repre-
sents the only means of “communication” between the
heads. By calculating the bending energies in all rele-
vant dimer states and its inﬂuence on transition rates,
we have shown that the elastic lever-arm model explains
the coordinated hand-over-hand motility by showing that
the lead head is not likely to bind to actin before the
trail head undergoes the major power stroke and that
it cannot commit its power stroke before the trail head
unbinds. The model also quantitatively reproduces the
measured force-velocity relations and shows how the run
length (the average distance a motor runs processively
before it dissociates from actin) could be used to deter-
mine some kinetic rates. Although the original model
reproduces the step size corresponding to about one half-
turn of the actin helix (13 actin subunits), there is a small
but signiﬁcant deviation between the predicted distribu-
tion of step sizes (mainly on the 13th subunit, with a side
peak on the 11th) and the statistics obtained from elec-

FIG. 1: The regular 13/6 helical model of an actin ﬁlament
(top), and the 28/13 helix with ±5◦ ﬂuctuations per subunit
(bottom). The subunits are shown blurred, with a relative
intensity corresponding to their statistical weight. The orien-
tation of the central subunit (denoted as “0”) is always kept
ﬁxed.

tron microscopy (EM) studies [7], which show the main
peak on the 13th subunit and two signiﬁcant side peaks
on the 11th and the 15th subunit, whereby the 15th is
stronger than the 11th.

The purpose of the current paper is to extend the
present model by including a more precise description
of the actin structure, which could potentially explain
the current deviation. The central modiﬁcation will be
to take into account torsional ﬂuctuations in the actin
structure. So far we have used the assumption that the
actin monomers are arranged on a helix with a periodic-
ity of 13 actin subunits (also called a 13/6 helix, because
× 360◦. However,
the rotation of each next subunit is 6
13
it has been known for some time that the actin ﬁlaments
have a variable, ﬂuctuating twist [8]. The nature and
the dynamics of these ﬂuctuations are not yet entirely
understood, but it seems that the azimuthal orientation
of each subunit can ﬂuctuate about ±5◦ with respect to
its neighbors [9]. There is some evidence that the dy-
namics of these ﬂuctuations is rather slow [10, 11], with
a characteristic time of the order of seconds. This would
imply that the twist has discrete states with a consider-
able energy barrier between them. The average twist per
subunit was found to be about 167◦, slightly more than
in the 13/6 helix, where it would be 166.15◦ (Fig. 1).

Based on many experimental and theoretical studies
[3, 6, 12, 13], the following picture of the working cy-
cle of dimeric myosin V has now found broad consensus
(Fig. 2). The major part of the dimeric cycle is spent in
the state with both heads binding ADP. The trail head

is in the post-powerstroke and the lead head likely in the
pre-powerstroke state [4, 6, 14], although the latter has
still been controversial recently (cf. ref. [15]). Then the
trail head releases ADP, binds a new ATP molecule and
unbinds from actin. With the trail head released, the
lead head is now free to undergo a power-stroke, where-
upon the former trail head binds in the lead position
(one step ahead in the direction of motion) and releases
Pi. This brings the dimer to the original state, however
one step further toward the actin plus end and with one
ATP molecule hydrolyzed.

Results

To calculate the step size, which is the main objective
of this article, the relevant transition is the binding of the
lead head (in the ADP.Pi state) while the trail head is
in the forward-leaning ADP conformation. Let us denote
the binding rate to the site i (counted from the trail head,
which is bound to site 0) with k+A(i) and the rate of the
reverse (unbinding) process as k−A(i). From the detailed
balance we know that the ratio of these rates has to obey

the fact that a myosin V molecule is able to perform reg-
ular steps against loads of at least 1.8 pN [16].

The elastic energy of a certain dimer conformation is
calculated in the following way (which is described in
more detail in Ref.[6]). A lever arm starting point is
positioned at

and its initial tangent is

x0 = 



ˆt0 = 

.






Other conditions state that the length of the lever arm
from the starting point to the joint has to be L and that
the endpoints of both lever arms coincide. The bending
energy is then given as

where EI denotes the bending modulus and dˆt
ds the local
curvature of a lever arm. The summation index j runs
over both lever arms. The shape of the dimeric molecule
is determined numerically in a way that minimizes U .

There are two possibilities concerning the reversibility
of the binding process. One possibility is that the lead
head binds to a site and does not detach before the next
power stroke. In this case, the probability that it binds
to the site i is

If, however, the lead head in the ADP.Pi (weakly bound)
state is allowed to detach and re-attach several times,
the probability to ﬁnd it on the site i is given by the
equilibrium distribution,

where ∆U denotes the increase in elastic energy upon
binding and F ∆x denotes the work done against the
applied load. k0
−A represent the binding and
unbinding rates of a head that binds without any elas-
tic distortions in the lever arm. Because the persistence
length of the lever arms is signiﬁcantly longer than their
actual length, we neglect thermal ﬂuctuations and the
corresponding entropic contributions to the total free en-
ergy. In the following we will also concentrate on the case
of an unloaded motor (F = 0). In this case the bending
energy in the initial state is 0 and ∆U is equal to the
elastic energy in the double-bound state. All model pa-
rameters are summarized in Table I and Fig. 3. The
geometric parameters were obtained from published EM
studies [4, 7]. The bending modulus of the lever arm (EI)
was estimated [6] based on a lower boundary provided by

Pi =

k+A(i)/k−A(i)
j k+A(j)/k−A(j)

.

P

So far, no experimental data are available about the
strain dependence of the detachment rate, k−A. How-
ever, as with most binding processes one can expect that
the activation point for the binding transition is closer to
the bound state, and therefore the strain-dependence of
k−A is weaker than that of k+A. We therefore neglect the
strain-dependence of detachment rates and assume that
the Boltzmann factor in Eq. (1) only inﬂuences k+A(i).
If the binding process is reversible, Pi (Eq. 6) becomes
independent of this assumption in any case.

To describe the ﬂuctuations in the actin helix, we will
use the coeﬃcients ai, which can assume the values -1,

If, on the other hand, the ﬂuctuations are slow, the

0 or 1. This corresponds to the assumption that each
subunit can have three orientations relative to its left
neighbor [10]. The twist between the subunits i − 1 and i
is then θi −θi−1 = θ0 +aiθ′, and the total twist of subunit
i relative to subunit 0 is θi = iθ0 + (a1 + a2 + . . . ai)θ′.

Another important question is the dynamics of the
actin ﬂuctuations. Let us denote the probability that
the helix is in the state with angles θ0 + a1θ′, θ0 + a2θ′,

If the ﬂuctuations are fast in comparison with the at-
tachment rate, the probability that the head binds to site
i is proportional to the attachment rate in each conﬁgu-
ration, weighted by the probability of that conﬁguration
and summed over all possible conﬁgurations:

for four diﬀerent lever arm lengths, corre-
sponding to mutants with 2, 4, 6 (wild type) and 8 IQ
motifs in the lever arm shows a notable diﬀerence in com-
parison with results on the 13/6 helix (Fig. 4).

To check the eﬀects of uncertainties in other model
parameters on our results, we have tried three modiﬁca-
tions: we have introduced an additional azimuthal com-
ponent of the power-stroke (meaning that after Pi release,
the lever arm makes an additional swing of 20◦ to the
right, while its starting point remains the same), we have
changed the lever arm angle φ in the pre-powerstroke
state and we have changed the lever arm stiﬀness. The re-
sults are summarized in Table II. None of the tested mod-
iﬁcations makes an improvement with regard to agree-
ment with experimental data as compared to the basic
model.

Another assumption we made in our model is that the
lever arm anchoring is stiﬀ in every state. While this
assumption is justiﬁed for long lever arms, the eﬀect of
compliance in the converter domain could play an impor-
tant role for short lever arms. Results on skeletal muscle
myosin (with short lever arms) indeed show that at least
half of the compliance is in the converter domain [17].
Therefore some care has to be taken when interpreting
the results for 2IQ lever arms.

The results for the slowly ﬂuctuating scenario show a
signiﬁcantly improved agreement with available experi-
ments [7] than the previous model, based on a stiﬀ 13/6
helix. In particular, the observation that the probabil-
ity for 15 subunit steps is about twice as high as for 11
subunit steps is well reproduced. The average step size
of 13.4 actin subunits (on a helix with a half-pitch of
14) also means that the molecule makes a left-handed
rotation of about 8◦ per step, or 0.2◦ per nm traveled.
This means that a freely walking myosin V makes one
revolution around the actin ﬁlament every 1.7 µm, well
consistent with a value of 2.2 µm, measured by Ali and
co-workers [18]. Note that their interpretation (based on
the assumption of a 13/6 helix) is that the steps repre-
sent a mixture of 11 and 13 subunit lengths. However,
on a 28/13 helix, data become consistent with a mixture
including 15 subunit steps, which are even more frequent
than 11 subunit steps.

The third experiment our model should be tested
against is the dependence of the step size on the lever arm
length. Purcell and co-workers [19] used optical tweezers
to determine the step size of diﬀerent dimeric constructs.
For wild-type myosin V (6 IQ domains), they measured
a step size of 35nm. For 4IQ mutants they measured
24nm or 8.7 actin subunits, and for 1IQ mutants 5nm
or 2 subunits. Also in this respect the current model
(predicting 13.4, 8 and 2 subunit steps, respectively) no-
ticeably improves the agreement with experimental data.
The previous model, based on a stiﬀ helix, predicted a
more abrupt step size change between 2 and 4IQ mutants.

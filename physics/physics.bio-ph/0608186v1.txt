Abstract

We present results of testing of the ability of eleven popular scoring functions to

predict native docked positions using a recently developed method [1] for estimation

the entropy contributions of relative motions to protein-ligand binding aﬃnity. The

method is based on the integration of the conﬁgurational integral over clusters obtained

from multiple docked positions. We use a test set of 100 PDB protein-ligand complexes

and ensembles of 101 docked positions generated by Wang et al [2] for each ligand in

the test set. To test the suggested method we compare the averaged root-mean square

deviations (RMSD) of the top-scored ligand docked positions, accounting and not ac-

counting for entropy contributions, relative to the experimentally determined positions.

We demonstrate that the method increases docking accuracy by 10− 21% when used in

conjunction with the AutoDock scoring function, by 2 − 25% with G-Score, by 7 − 41%

with D-Score, by 0 − 8% with LigScore, by 1 − 6% with PLP, by 0 − 12% with LUDI,

by 2 − 8% with F-Score, by 7 − 29% with ChemScore, by 0 − 9% with X-Score, by

2 − 19% with PMF, and by 1 − 7% with DrugScore. We also compare the performance

of the suggested method with the method based on ranking by cluster occupancy only.

We analyze how the choice of a RMSD-tolerance and a low bound of dense clusters

impacts on docking accuracy of the scoring methods. We derive optimal intervals of

the RMSD-tolerance for 11 scoring functions.

Key words: protein-ligand docking, binding aﬃnity, entropy, scoring function,

cluster occupancy.

Introduction

The prediction of the experimentally observed positions and conformations of small or-
ganic ligands on the surface of macromolecules (e.g. proteins, DNAs) is known as the docking
problem. Methods and tools for solving the docking problem attract a great attention in
scientiﬁc community for many years [1-13]. The accurate and fast solution of the dock-
ing problem is of fundamental practical importance for understanding numerous biological
process in cells and for the discovery of new drug lead compounds [3-6,11-15]. Docking

tests and detailed comparative analysis of the performance of diﬀerent docking tools [16-23]
demonstrate the dependence of docking accuracy on the conformational search methods, the
quality of the protein-ligand potentials describing binding enthalpy and scoring methods for
estimation of protein-ligand binding entropy.

Scoring functions play an important role in computational studies of protein-ligand struc-
tures and of thermodynamics of protein-ligand binding [1,2,6-13], in virtual database screen-

ing and drug design [3-7,24-34]. We have recently suggested and validated a novel method
to estimate protein-ligand binding entropy [1]. We showed that accounting for the entropy
of relative and torsional motions through a conﬁgurational integral modiﬁes a commonly
used form of scoring functions with a term dependent on occupancy of the clusters obtained
from a number of docked positions. The docked positions were generated using AutoDock
[24] docking program and then grouped into nonoverlaping clusters in such a way that every
cluster contains ligand positions with RMSD less than a pre-set value (a RMSD-tolerance).

Ruvinsky and Kozintsev [1] showed that the method essentially improves docking accuracy
in comparison with the common method based on ranking by energy when used in conjunc-
tion with the AutoDock scoring function. So it is very intriguing and also important to
investigate the performance of the method with other scoring functions.

The present article describes results of the application of the method [1] in conjunction
with eleven popular scoring functions (AutoDock [24], G-Score [25], D-Score [26], LigScore
[27], PLP [28], LUDI [29], F-Score [30], ChemScore [31], X-Score [32], PMF [33], DrugScore

[34]) and a test set of 100 PDB protein-ligand complexes developed by Wang et al [2]
to predict ligand docked positions. The test set developed by Wang et al [2] essentially
diﬀers from a test set of 135 PDB complexes used by Ruvinsky and Kozintsev [1]. The
overlap of the test sets consists of three protein-ligand complexes: 2pk4, 1rbp and 1rnt.
Wang et al [2] generated ensembles of 101 docked positions for each ligand in the test set
(http://sw16.im.med.umich.edu/software/xtool/) and scored them by the above mentioned

eleven scoring functions. Using these ensembles and the eleven scoring functions modiﬁed
with the entropy term [1], we reordered docked ligand positions in ensembles. Then we
compared the RMSD of top-scored ligand docked positions, accounting and not accounting

3

for the entropy, relative to the experimentally determined positions.

The organization of this paper is as follows. We derive an expression for the entropy
contribution of relative and torsional motions in the Materials and Methods section. Also
in the Materials and Methods we describe the test set of protein-ligand PDB complexes and
ensembles of docked conformations. In the Results section we compare docking accuracies
of calculations with and without entropy contributions in terms of RMSD of the top-scored

ligand docked positions relative to the experimentally determined positions. Also in Results
we compare the suggested method with the method based on cluster occupancy only. We
summarize our conclusions in the ﬁnal section.

Materials and Methods: Theory

Protein-ligand binding free energy can be written as [11, 12, 15] (see also [35-47])

∆G = Epl − Ep − El − T ln

σlσp
σpl

coNa
8π2

Zpl
ZpZl !

where Ep,l,pl are the ground energies of protein (p), ligand (l) and protein-ligand complex
(pl) in solution; Na is the Avogadro number; co = 1mol/l; σl,p,pl are the orders of symmetry
of ligand, protein and protein-ligand complex (for a nonsymmetrical molecule σ = 1; if a
molecule has 2-fold axis of symmetry σ = 2, etc.); Zpl,p,l are vibrational partition functions
of proteins, ligands and complexes.

Considering only relative protein-ligand motions we can write the protein-ligand binding

free energy in the form [1, 11, 12, 15]

∆G = Epl − Ep − El − T ln

coNa

where

VB =

dr sin θ dθ dϕ dψ

is the conﬁgurational integral of the complex; Upl(r, θ, ϕ, ψ) is the energy of the protein-
ligand complex in solution; r is the vector of relative translational motions in the complex;
(θ, ϕ, ψ) are Euler angles of relative orientational motions; Γ is the the region of integration
in the 6-dimensional space of r and (θ, ϕ, ψ); Epl is the minimum of Upl(r, θ, ϕ, ψ) in the
region Γ.

Note that to predict the native binding mode corresponding to the minimum of the Exp.
(2), we can neglect the contribution of Ep + El to binding free energy. But the absolute
value of the binding constant, of course, depends on the energies of the unbound protein
and ligand molecules. Thus the binding mode is exactly deﬁned by Epl(Γ) and VB(Γ).

4

This property of the Exp. (3) essentially simpliﬁes docking problem in comparison with the
problem of binding aﬃnity prediction and allows searching docked positions using probability
distribution functions [48].

Further we follow the method suggested recently [1].

In brief, it depends on the fact
that most docking algorithms generate a number of diﬀerent ligand positions corresponding
to diﬀerent local minima of the protein-ligand energy landscape. To estimate VB, we ﬁrst
partition all docked ligand positions (Fig. 1) from a number of runs of an algorithm into non-
overlapping clusters in such a way that every cluster contains ligand positions with RMSD
less than a deﬁnite value (0.5 − 4˚A; see Methods section) relative to the ligand position
having minimal energy in the cluster. Now we can consider the clusters as the possible ligand
binding modes. Further, we designate the docked ligand position having minimal energy in
the cluster as the representative position in the cluster. All ligand positions in the cluster
numbered i can be considered as snapshots of the ligand motion near the representative
docked position (ri, Ωi). The variation intervals of (r, Ω) in the cluster give the estimate of
the conﬁgurational integral as

VB(ri, Ωi) ≈ Γi = [max(θi) − min(θi)] [max(ϕi) − min(ϕi)][max(ψi) − min(ψi)]

[max(xi) − min(xi)][max(yi) − min(yi)][max(zi) − min(zi)],

(4)

where max(ri, Ωi) and min(ri, Ωi) are the maximum and minimum values of (r, Ω) in the
cluster numbered i.

Omitting the contribution of Ep + El and σlσpcoNa/(8σplπ2) we obtain

∆ ˜Gi = Epl(Γi) − T ln Γi,

where Epl(Γi) is the energy minimum of the protein-ligand complex in the i-mode. To
determine the binding mode we have to determine the set {Γ}, calculate the Exp. (5) for all
Γi and select a representative position having a minimal value of ˜Gi. Exp. (5) can also be
derived by a Monte-Carlo approximation of the conﬁgurational integral (3)[1].

The use of Γi ≈ Nivp (vp is volume per point in the conﬁgurational space, Ni is the

number of conformations in the cluster numbered i) converts Exp. (5) into

∆ ˜Gi = Epl(Γi) − T ln (Nivp)

Thus the binding mode is exactly deﬁned by Epl(Γi) and Ni. Further, we use the Exp. (6)
to rank the representative positions.

To derive a scoring expression for the method of ranking by cluster occupancy [22, 48, 49]
(see also [50-54] and [55, 56] for the using of the method in the studies of the protein folding

(5)

(6)

and protein-protein docking) we rewrite the Exp. (6) in the following form

P (i) = Nivp exp

−

Epl(Γi)
T

!

 

(7)

P (i) is proportional to the probability of ﬁnding the ligand in the cluster i. Assuming that
Epl(Γ) is a slowly varying function over {Γ}, we obtain P (i) ∼ Ni, and the cluster occupancy
becomes a single factor identifying the native binding position. Thus the methods of ranking
by cluster occupancy or by energy Epl are the special cases of the more general method based
on the Exp. (6).

In the Results section we shall compare results of three scoring methods identifying the
binding position as the representative position with the minimal value ∆ ˜G (Method 1), as
the docked position with the minimal energy Epl (Method 2), and as the representative
position in the most occupied cluster (Method 3).

Materials and Methods: The Test Set

We used the test set of 100 PDB protein-ligand complexes [2]: 1bbz, 4xia, 8xia, 2xim,
1fkf, 1fkb, 1hvr, 1tet, 2cgr, 1abf, 1apb, 7abp, 5abp, 8abp, 9abp, 1abe, 1bap, 6abp, 1e96,
1add, 2ak3, 1adb, 9aat, 1bzm, 1cbx, 2ctc, 3cpa, 1cla, 3cla, 4cla, 2csc, 5cna, 1af2, 1dr1, 1dhf,
1drf, 1ela, 7est, 3fx2, 2gbp, 1hsl, 2qwd, 2qwe, 2qwf, 2qwg, 2qwc, 2qwb, 1mnc, 1exw, 1apw,
1apt, 1bxo, 1fmo, 2pk4, 1inc, 4sga, 5sga, 5p21, 1rbp, 1rgk, 6rnt, 1rgl, 1rnt, 1zzz, 1yyy, 1b5g,
1ba8, 1bb0, 2sns, 1sre, 7tln, 4tln, 1tmn, 2tmn, 3tmn, 5tln, 1tlp, 1etr, 1ets, 1d3d, 1d3p,
1a46, 1a5g, 1bcu, 1tha, 4tim, 6tim, 7tim, 1bra, 1tnj, 1pph, 1tnk, 1tnh, 1tni, 1ppc, 1tng,
3ptb, 1tnl, 1bhf, 2xis. All these entries have resolution better than 2.5˚A. Wang et al [2]
generated an ensemble of 101 docked conformations for each ligand in the test set. One of
the conformations corresponds to the experimentally observed native conformation of the
ligand. RMSD distributions in the conformational ensembles spread from 0˚A to 15˚A. For
RMSD-tolerance of 2˚A ensembles consist of 30 − 70 distinctive conformational clusters.

To analyze an ability of the scoring functions to predict the experimentally observed

conformations eleven scoring functions were applied to score the conformational ensembles
[2]. We used the scored ensembles of each ligand and applied the Exp. (6) to test the ability
of the suggested method to predict the native conformation. We varied the RMSD-tolerance
from 0.5 to 4˚A.

For correct use of the Exp. (6) it is necessary to keep in mind that it is based on the
estimate of the conﬁgurational integral. Thus only clusters with high occupancy should be

scored with Exp. (6). To diﬀerentiate between dense and sparse clusters, we introduce a
low bound Nlb of dense clusters. Only clusters with Ni ≥ Nlb are scored with Exp. (6).
If all clusters have occupancy lower than Nlb, we select the most occupied cluster as the
cluster of the binding position, but if several clusters have the same occupancy lower than
Nlb, we compare them using Exp. (6). Further we consider the percentage of the top-ranked
solutions within a RMSD of 2˚A of the experimental result and designate this value as the
success rate (SR). Success rates of three scoring methods used in conjunction with 11 scoring
functions are given in Fig. 2-12 for the low bound of dense clusters equal to 3, 4, 5 and 10.

Force ﬁeld based scoring functions
AutoDock

As the RMSD-tolerance increases from 1˚A to 4˚A, Method 1 based on Exp. (6) applied
with the AutoDock scoring function improves the success rate by 3 − 13% relative to the

results of ranking by energy (Method 2) not accounting for the entropy eﬀect (Fig. 2-a).
SR of the Method 1 reaches maximum of 75% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A and the low
bound of 4. SR of ranking by cluster occupancy (Method 3) reaches maximum of 73% for the
RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A. For the RMSD-tolerance of 0.5, 1, 3.5 and 4˚A ranking by cluster
occupancy is less successful than ranking by energy.

Fig. 2-b shows that Method 1 applied together with the G-Score scoring function im-
proves the success rate by 2 − 25% relative to the results of ”bare” G-Score (Method 2).
SR of the Method 1 reaches maximum of 67% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A and the low
bound of 5 and 10. SR of ranking by cluster occupancy reaches maximum of 70% for the
RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A also. For all values of the RMSD-tolerance energy ranking is a
worse predictor than ranking based on Exp. (6) and by cluster occupancy.

G-Score

D-Score

Applying Exp. (6) in conjunction with the D-Score scoring function improves essentially
the success rate by 7 − 41% relative to the results of the Method 2 (Fig. 2-c) . SR of the
Method 1 reaches maximum of 67% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A and the low bound of 5
and 10. SR of the Method 3 has a maximum of 69% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A. The
worst results of scoring (SR = 26%) for all values of the RMSD-tolerance are obtained for

Method 2.

Empirical scoring functions
LigScore

We found that as the RMSD-tolerance increases from 2˚A to 4˚A, Method 1 applied with
the LigScore scoring function improves the success rate by 0 − 8% relative to the results of
Method 2 (Fig. 2-d). For the RMSD-tolerance < 2˚A, the diﬀerence between Method 2 using
”bare” LigScore and Methods 1 and 2 is 1 − 8% and 6 − 13%. SR of Method 1 using Exp. (6)
reaches maximum of 82% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A and the low bound of 3 and 4. SR
of Method 3 using cluster occupancy reaches maximum of 74% for the RMSD-tolerance of
2˚A and 2.5˚A. For the RMSD-tolerance > 2.5˚A, Method 2 with energy ranking outperforms
Method 3 by 1 − 8%, but worse than Method 1 by 0 − 8%.

Docking accuracy of Method 1 applied with PLP scoring function (Fig. 2-e) is comparable
with the accuracy of Method 2 using energy ranking for the case of the RMSD-tolerance lower
than 2˚A, but becomes better by 1 − 6% for the case of the RMSD-tolerance higher than 2˚A.
SR of the Method 1 reaches maximum of 82% for the RMSD-tolerance of 3.0˚A and the low
bound of 4. SR of Method 3 using ranking by cluster occupancy reaches maximum of 79%
for the RMSD-tolerance of 3.0˚A. For two values of the RMSD-tolerance of 3˚A and 3.5˚A
ranking by cluster occupancy slightly outperforms energy ranking by 3% and 1%, but loses
0 − 3% to the results of ranking by Method 1. For other values of the RMSD-tolerance
Methods 1, 2 show better docking results than Method 3.

Fig. 2-f shows that as the RMSD-tolerance increases from 0.5˚A to 4˚A, Method 1 applied
with the LUDI scoring function improves the success rate by 0 − 12% relative to the results
of Method 2. SR of Method 1 using Exp. (6) reaches maximum of 79% for the RMSD-
tolerance of 3.0˚A and the low bound of 10. SR of Method 3 reaches maximum of 77% for
the RMSD-tolerance of 3.0˚A. Method 2 outperforms by 2 − 7% Method 3 only in two cases
of the RMSD-tolerance of 0.5, 1.0˚A.

The results of ranking docked positions on the basis of Methods 1, 2 and 3 in conjunction
with F-Score scoring function are shown in Fig. 2-g. We can see that as the RMSD-tolerance
increases from 1.5˚A to 4˚A, Method 1 improves the success rate by 2 − 8% relative to the
results of Method 2. SR of Method 1 reaches maximum of 82% for the RMSD-tolerance
of 3.0˚A and the low bound of 3, 5, 10. SR of Method 3 using ranking by cluster occupancy
reaches maximum of 77% for the RMSD-tolerance of 3.0˚A and 3.5˚A. For the RMSD-tolerance
lower than 2˚A Method 2 (SR = 74%) outperforms Method 3 by 3 − 9%.

Fig. 2-h shows that there is a signiﬁcant improvement of docking accuracy for Methods 1
and 3 applied with ChemScore scoring function, in comparison with the results of the Method
2, choosing the energy top-ranked position to identify the binding position. Methods 1 and
3 outperform the Method 2 by 6 − 29% and 8 − 32% accordingly. SR of Method 1 using
Exp. (6) reaches maximum of 64% for the RMSD-tolerance of 1.5, 2.0˚A and the low bound
of 4, 5. SR of Method 3 reaches maximum of 67% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.0˚A.

ChemScore

X-Score

Fig. 2-i shows that Methods 1 and 3 applied with the X-Score scoring function improve
the success rate by 0 − 9% for the RMSD-tolerance from 1.0˚A to 4˚A, and 0 − 8% for the
RMSD-tolerance from 1.5˚A to 4˚A relative to the results of Method 2 not accounting for the
entropy eﬀect. SR of Method 1 reaches maximum of 75% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A
and the low bound of 4, 5, 10. SR of Method 3 using ranking by cluster occupancy reaches
maximum of 74% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A. For the RMSD-tolerance of 0.5, 1 and
4˚A energy ranking (SR = 66%) slightly outperforms by 1 − 3% results of Method 3.

Knowledge-based scoring functions
PMF

Fig. 2-j illustrates results of applying ranking Methods 1,2 and 3 in conjunction with
the PMF scoring function. We observe that Methods 1 and 3 outperform by 2 − 19% and
2 − 20% the results of the common Method 2 using energy ranking (SR = 52%). SR of
Method 1 using Exp. (6) reaches maximum of 71% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A and the
low bound of 5. SR of Method 3 using ranking by cluster occupancy reaches maximum of
72% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A.

As the RMSD-tolerance increases from 1.0˚A to 4˚A, Method 1 applied with the DrugScore
scoring function improves the success rate by 1 − 7% (Fig. 2-k) relative to the results of
Method 2 (SR = 72%). SR of using Method 1 reaches maximum of 79% for the RMSD-
tolerance of 3.0˚A and the low bound of 4, and the RMSD-tolerance of 4.0˚A and the low
bound of 10. SR of Method 3 reach maximum of 75% for the RMSD-tolerance of 2˚A and
3˚A. For the RMSD-tolerance lower than 1.5˚A and equal to 4˚A energy ranking (Method 2)
outperforms by 2 − 7% results of Method 3 using ranking by cluster occupancy.

Discussions

The success rate of ranking using Exp. (6) (Method 1) shows a bell-shape curve behavior
(Fig. 2) for all scoring functions except LigScore (Fig. 2-d). It means that 10 of 11 scoring
functions closely describe protein-ligand energy landscapes in the test set. Tails of the bell-
shape functions approach a value of the success rate of energy ranking neglecting the entropy
eﬀect. This is the result of reduction of the suggested method to the method of ranking by
Indeed, for a very low
energy for a very small or large RMSD-tolerance of cluster size.

RMSD-tolerance all clusters contain a single docked position and ranking using the Method
1 and ranking by energy (Method 2) are became identical. In the limit of a very large RMSD-
tolerance, only one cluster exists and thus ranking by Method 1 and Method 2 give the same
results for the success rate. The bell-shape curve behavior for PMF is not so evident (Fig.
2-j) as for AutoDock (Fig. 2-a), D-Score (Fig. 2-c), LUDI (Fig. 2-f) or ChemScore (Fig.
2-h). However, it can be detected averaging SR over diﬀerent values of the low bound of

the cluster size for every value of the RMSD-tolerance or by following rhombus and stars on
Fig. 2-j. The SR behavior for Method 1 applied in conjunction with LigScore as a function
of the RMSD-tolerance and the low bound of the cluster size has the same character for a
very low and large values of the RMSD-tolerance, but diﬀers in the most interesting range
of intermediate values of the RMSD-tolerance. It has two clear extrema - a minimum for
the RMSD-tolerance of 1˚A and a maximum for the RMSD-tolerance of 2.5˚A.

It is interesting to note that all scoring functions demonstrate even behavior of a max-

imum as a function of the RMSD-tolerance. Thus applying Method 1 we can vary the
RMSD-tolerance in pre-set intervals keeping a level of docking accuracy averaged over the
low bound of the cluster size. So AutoDock allows one to vary the RMSD-tolerance from
1.5˚A to 3˚A (Fig. 2-a), G-Score - from 1.5˚A to 2.5˚A (Fig. 2-b), D-Score - from 1.5˚A to 2.5˚A
(Fig. 2-c), LigScore - from 2.5˚A to 4˚A (Fig. 2-d), PLP - from 2.5˚A to 4˚A (Fig. 2-e), LUDI
- from 2˚A to 3˚A (Fig. 2-f), F-Score - from 2.5˚A to 4˚A (Fig. 2-g), ChemScore - from 1.5˚A
to 2.5˚A (Fig. 2-h), X-Score - from 2˚A to 3˚A (Fig. 2-i), PMF - from 1.5˚A to 3.5˚A (Fig. 2-j),
DrugScore - from 2.5˚A to 4˚A (Fig. 2-k). Considering optimal values of the RMSD-tolerance
and the low bound of the cluster size, we found that Method 1 outperforms Method 2 in
docking accuracy by 10−21% when used in conjunction with the AutoDock scoring function,
by 2 − 25% with G-Score, by 7 − 41% with D-Score, by 0 − 8% with LigScore, by 1 − 6%
with PLP, by 0 − 12% with LUDI, by 2 − 8% with F-Score, by 7 − 29% with ChemScore, by
0 − 9% with X-Score, by 2 − 19% with PMF, and by 1 − 7% with DrugScore. These results

are the unambiguous evidence of improving docking accuracy by accounting for the entropy
of relative and torsional motions.

The success rate of scoring over cluster occupancy (Method 3) also shows the bell-shape

10

curve behavior for AutoDock (Fig. 2-a), G-Score (Fig. 2-b), D-Score (Fig. 2-c), ChemScore
(Fig. 2-h), X-Score (Fig. 2-i) and PMF (Fig. 2-j). For PLP (Fig. 2-e), LigScore (Fig.
2-d), LUDI (Fig. 2-f), F-Score (Fig. 2-g), DrugScore (Fig. 2-k) curves of SR as a function
of the RMSD-tolerance diﬀer from the bulb function behavior and show several extrema.
Considering optimal values of the RMSD-tolerance, we found that Method 3 outperforms
Method 2 in docking accuracy by 11% when used in conjunction with the AutoDock scoring

function, by 28% with G-Score, by 43% with D-Score, by 3% with PLP, by 10% with LUDI,
by 3% with F-Score, by 32% with ChemScore, by 8% with X-Score, by 20% with PMF, and
by 3% with DrugScore. Best results of Method 3 applied with LigScore coincide with the
results of ranking by LigScore energy (Method 2).

It is interesting to note that SRs of ranking using Method 3 and Method 1 show good
correlation for AutoDock, D-Score, G-Score, LUDI, ChemScore and X-Score. It means that
using these scoring functions and applying Methods 1 or 3 we choose the same top-scored

representative position satisfying simultaneously to the following inequalities

N1 > Ni and N1 exp

where 1 is the cluster number of the top-scored representative position. Other representative

positions are numbered i 6= 1. Using Ineq. (8) we obtain

On condition Epl(Γ1) > Epl(Γi), top-scored representative positions reside not in deepest
energy wells. Using Ineq. (9) we can estimate the maximal diﬀerence between depths of
energy wells in protein-ligand energy landscape as T ln (N1/ min(Ni)) = 2.8kcal/mol for
T = 300K, N1 = 99 and min(Ni) = 1. If Epl(Γ1) < Epl(Γi), then top-scored representative
positions reside in the deepest and mostly occupied energy wells.

Conclusions

We presented results of testing 11 popular scoring functions on 100 protein-ligand com-
plexes using the recently suggested method [1], accounting for binding entropy of relative
motions in a protein-ligand complex, and two other commonly used methods of ranking by
energy or cluster occupancy. We rigorously showed that both methods of ranking by cluster
occupancy and by energy are the special cases of the more general method accounting for

binding entropy. We applied the three ranking methods to the conformational ensembles
generated by Wang et al [2] and compared eﬃciencies of the methods in terms of the per-
centage of the top-ranked solutions within a RMSD of 2˚A of the experimental result (the
success rate).

We demonstrated that the method based on Exp. (6) predicts native position signiﬁcantly
better than the top energy ranking, when used in conjunction with D-Score, ChemScore,
AutoDock, G-Score, or PMF, and moderately or slightly better when used with LigScore,
PLP, LUDI, F-Score, X-Score, or DrugScore. The presented results prove that the method
can be applied together with all types of current force ﬁelds, empirical scoring functions or
knowledge-based potentials.

For the most of tested scoring functions we observed strong correlations between docking
accuracies of two methods of ranking using Exp. (6) and ranking by cluster occupancy. These
correlations suggest that for these potentials the near-native conformations, in comparison
with far-native ones, have the greatest number of neighboring conformations within a RMSD-
tolerance. Similar trends were observed recently in studies of protein-ligand docking [22, 48,
49], predictions of protein-protein complexes [55, 56] and studies of protein folding landscape
[50, 51, 52, 53]. Also this concept was used by Xiang et al [54] for loop prediction. The

authors suggested to rank conformations by a standard energy term together with a RMSD-
dependent term that favors conformations that have many neighbors in conﬁgurational space.
We believe that the method to treat the entropy eﬀect using Exp. (6) should give statistical-
thermodynamic explanations of these results and prove useful for future studies of protein
folding and protein-protein docking.

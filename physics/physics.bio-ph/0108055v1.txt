abstract– This paper introduces the notion of measure
representation of DNA sequences. Spectral analysis and mul-
tifractal analysis are then performed on the measure repre-
sentations of a large number of complete genomes. The main
aim of this paper is to discuss the multifractal property of
the measure representation and the classiﬁcation of bacteria.
From the measure representations and the values of the Dq
spectra and related Cq curves, it is concluded that these com-
plete genomes are not random sequences.
In fact, spectral
analyses performed indicate that these measure representa-
tions considered as time series, exhibit strong long-range cor-
relation. Here the long-range correlation is for the K-strings
with the dictionary ordering, and it is diﬀerent from the base
pair correlations introduced by other people. For substrings
with length K = 8, the Dq spectra of all organisms studied are
multifractal-like and suﬃciently smooth for the Cq curves to
be meaningful. With the decreasing value of K, the multifrac-
tality lessens. The Cq curves of all bacteria resemble a clas-
sical phase transition at a critical point. But the ’analogous’
phase transitions of chromosomes of non-bacteria organisms
are diﬀerent. Apart from Chromosome 1 of C. elegans, they
exhibit the shape of double-peaked speciﬁc heat function. A
classiﬁcation of genomes of bacteria by assigning to each se-
quence a point in two-dimensional space (D−1, D1) and in
three-dimensional space (D−1, D1, D−2) was given. Bacteria
that are close phylogenetically are almost close in the spaces
(D−1, D1) and (D−1, D1, D−2).

I. INTRODUCTION

DNA sequences are of fundamental importance in un-
derstanding living organisms, since all information of the
hereditary and species evolution is contained in these
macromolecules. The DNA sequence is formed by four
diﬀerent nucleotides, namely adenine (a), cytosine (c),
guanine (g) and thymine (t). A large number of these

DNA sequences is widely available in recent times. One
of the challenges of DNA sequence analysis is to deter-
mine the patterns in these sequences. It is useful to dis-
tinguish coding from noncoding sequences. Problems re-
lated to the classiﬁcation and evolution of organisms are
also important. A signiﬁcant contribution in these stud-
ies is to investigate the long-range correlation in DNA
sequences[1−16]. Li et al. [1] found that the spectral den-
sity of a DNA sequence containing mostly introns shows
1/f β behaviour, which indicates the presence of long-
range correlation when 0 < β < 1. The correlation prop-
erties of coding and noncoding DNA sequences were ﬁrst
studied by Peng et al. [2] in their fractal landscape or
DNA walk model. The DNA walk [2] was deﬁned as that
the walker steps “up” if a pyrimidine (c or t) occurs at
position i along the DNA chain, while the walker steps
“down” if a purine (a or g) occurs at position i. Peng et
al. [2] discovered that there exists long-range correlation
in noncoding DNA sequences while the coding sequences
correspond to a regular random walk. By undertaking
a more detailed analysis, Chatzidimitriou et al. [5] con-
cluded that both coding and noncoding sequences exhibit
long-range correlation. A subsequent work by Prabhu
and Claverie [6] also substantially corroborates these re-
sults. If one considers more details by distinguishing c
from t in pyrimidine, and a from g in purine (such as
two or three-dimensional DNA walk models [15] and maps
given by Yu and Chen [16]), then the presence of base cor-
relation has been found even in coding sequences. On the
other hand, Buldyrev et al. [12] showed that long-range
correlation appears mainly in noncoding DNA using all
the DNA sequences available. Based on equal-symbol
correlation, Voss [8] showed a power law behaviour for the
sequences studied regardless of the proportion of intron
contents. These studies add to the controversy about
the possible presence of correlation in the entire DNA or
only in the noncoding DNA. From a diﬀerent angle, frac-
tal analysis is a relative new analytical technique that
has proven useful in revealing complex patterns in nat-
ural objects. Berthelsen et al. [17] considered the global
fractal dimensions of human DNA sequences treated as
pseudorandom walks.

In the above studies, the authors only considered short
or long DNA segments. Since the ﬁrst complete genome
of the free-living bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium was
sequenced in 1995 [18], an ever-growing number of com-
plete genomes has been deposited in public databases.
The availability of complete genomes induces the pos-

sibility to establish some global properties of these se-
quences. Vieira [19] carried out a low-frequency analy-
sis of the complete DNA of 13 microbial genomes and
showed that their fractal behaviour does not always pre-
vail through the entire chain and the autocorrelation
functions have a rich variety of behaviours including
the presence of anti-persistence. Yu and Wang [20] pro-
posed a time series model of coding sequences in com-
plete genomes. For fuller details on the number, size and
ordering of genes along the chromosome, one can refer
to Part 5 of Lewin [21]. One may ignore the composi-
tion of the four kinds of bases in coding and noncod-
ing segments and only consider the global structure of
the complete genomes or long DNA sequences. Provata
[22] proposed a fractal Cantor pattern
and Almirantis
of DNA. They mapped coding segments to ﬁlled regions
and noncoding segments to empty regions of a random
Cantor set and then calculated the fractal dimension of
this set. They found that the coding/noncoding partition
in DNA sequences of lower organisms is homogeneous-
like, while in the higher eucariotes the partition is frac-
tal. This result doesn’t seem reﬁned enough to distin-
guish bacteria because the fractal dimensions of bacteria
given by them [22] are all the same. The classiﬁcation
and evolution relationship of bacteria is one of the most
important problems in DNA research. Yu and Anh [23]
proposed a time series model based on the global struc-
ture of the complete genome and considered three kinds
of length sequences. After calculating the correlation di-
mensions and Hurst exponents, it was found that one can
get more information from this model than that of fractal
Cantor pattern. Some results on the classiﬁcation and
evolution relationship of bacteria were found [23]. The
correlation property of these length sequences has been
discussed [24].

Although statistical analysis performed directly on
DNA sequences has yielded some success, there has been
some indication that this method is not powerful enough
to amplify the diﬀerence between a DNA sequence and a
random sequence as well as to distinguish DNA sequences
themselves in more details [25]. One needs more power-
ful global and visual methods. For this purpose, Hao et
al. [25] proposed a visualisation method based on count-
ing and coarse-graining the frequency of appearance of
substrings with a given length. They called it the portrait
of an organism. They found that there exist some fractal
patterns in the portraits which are induced by avoiding
and under-represented strings. The fractal dimension of
the limit set of portraits was also discussed [26,27]. There
are other graphical methods of sequence patterns, such
as chaos game representation [28,29].

In the portrait representation, Hao et al. [25] used
squares to represent substrings and discrete colour grades
to represent the frequencies of the substrings in the com-
plete genome. It is diﬃcult to know the accurate value
of the frequencies of the substrings from the portrait rep-
resentation. In order to improve it, in this paper we use
subintervals in one-dimensional space to represent sub-

strings and then we can directly obtain an accurate his-
togram of the substrings in the complete genome. We
then view the histogram as a measure, which we call the
measure representation of the complete genome. When
the measure representation is viewed as a time series, a
spectral analysis can be carried out.

Global calculations neglect the fact that DNA se-
quences are highly inhomogeneous. Multifractal analysis
is a useful way to characterise the spatial inhomogeneity
of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns [30].
Multifractal analysis was initially proposed to treat tur-
In recent years it has been applied suc-
bulence data.
cessfully in many diﬀerent ﬁelds including time series
analysis [31,32] and ﬁnancial modelling (see Anh et al.
[33]). For DNA sequences, application of the multifrac-
tal technique seems rare (we have found only Berthelsen
et al. [34]). In this paper, we pay more attention to this
application. The quantities pertained to spectral and
multifractal analyses of measures are described in Sec-
tion 3. Application of the methodology is undertaken in
Section 4 on a number of representative chromosomes. A
discussion of the empirical results and some conclusions
are drawn in Section 5, where we also address the use of
the multifractal technology in the classiﬁcation problem
of bacteria.

II. MEASURE REPRESENTATION

We call any string made of K letters from the set
{g, c, a, t} a K-string. For a given K there are in to-
tal 4K diﬀerent K-strings. In order to count the number
of each kind of K-strings in a given DNA sequence 4K
counters are needed. We divide the interval [0, 1[ into 4K
disjoint subintervals, and use each subinterval to repre-
sent a counter. Letting s = s1 · · · sK, si ∈ {a, c, g, t}, i =
1, · · · , K, be a substring with length K, we deﬁne

xl(s) =

K

X
i=1

xi =

if si = a,
if si = c,
if si = g,
if si = t,

xr(s) = xl(s) +

4K .

(1)

(2)

(3)

We then use the subinterval [xl(s), xr(s)[ to represent
substring s. Let NK(s) be the number of times that sub-
string s with length K appears in the complete genome.
If the number of bases in the complete genome is L, we
deﬁne

where

and

FK (s) = NK(s)/(L − K + 1)

to be the frequency of substring s.
It follows that
P{s} FK(s) = 1. Now we can deﬁne a measure µK on
[0, 1[ by dµK(x) = Y (x)dx, where

YK(x) = 4KFK(s), when x ∈ [xl(s), xr(s)[.

FK(s). We call µK the measure representation of the
organism corresponding to the given K. As an example,
the histogram of substrings in the genome of M. genital-
ium for K = 3, ..., 8 are given in FIG. 1. Self-similarity
is apparent in the measure.

For simplicity of notation, the index K is dropped in

FK(s), etc., from now on, where its meaning is clear.

Remark: The ordering of a, c, g, t in (2) will give
the natural dictionary ordering of K-strings in the one-
dimensional space. A diﬀerent ordering of K-strings
would change the nature of the correlations. But in our
case, a diﬀerent ordering of a, c, g, t in (2) give almost tha
same Dq curve (therefore, the same with the Cq curve)
which will be deﬁned in the next section when the abso-
lute value of q is relative small. We give the FIG. 2 to
support this point of view. Hence a diﬀerent ordering of
a, c, g, t in (2) will not change our result. When we want
to compare diﬀerent bacteria using the measure repre-
sentation, once the ordering of a, c, g, t in (2) is given, it
is ﬁxed for all bacteria.

III. SPECTRAL AND MULTIFRACTAL
ANALYSES

We can order all the F (s) according to the increas-
ing order of xl(s). We then obtain a sequence of real
numbers consisting of 4K elements which we denote as
F (t), t = 1, · · · , 4K. Viewing the sequence {F (t)}4
t=1 as a
time series, the spectral analysis can then be undertaken
on the sequence.

K

We ﬁrst consider the discrete Fourier transform [35] of

the time series F (t), t = 1, · · · , 4K, deﬁned by

F (f ) = N −
b

N −1

X
t=0

F (t + 1)e−2πif t.

Then

S(f ) = |

F (f )|2
b

is the power spectrum of F (t).
In recent studies, it
has been found [36] that many natural phenomena lead
to the power spectrum of the form 1/f β. This kind of
dependence was named 1/f noise, in contrast to white
noise S(f ) = const, i.e. β = 0. Let the frequency f take
k values fk = k/N, k = 1, · · · , N/8. From the ln(S(f ))
vs.
ln(f ) graph, we can infer the value of β using the
above low-frequency range. For example, we give the log

The most common operative numerical implementa-
tions of multifractal analysis are the so-called ﬁxed-size
[37].
box-counting algorithms
In the one-dimensional
case, for a given measure µ with support E ⊂ R, we
consider the partition sum

Zǫ(q) =

[µ(B)]q,

X
µ(B)6=0

q ∈ R, where the sum runs over all diﬀerent nonempty
boxes B of a given side ǫ in a grid covering of the support
E, that is,

B = [kǫ, (k + 1)ǫ[.

The exponent τ (q) is deﬁned by

τ (q) = lim
ǫ→0

ln Zǫ(q)
ln ǫ

and the generalized fractal dimensions of the measure are
deﬁned as

Dq = τ (q)/(q − 1),

for q 6= 1,

(11)

and

Dq = lim
ǫ→0

Z1,ǫ
ln ǫ

,

for q = 1.

(12)

where Z1,ǫ =
Pµ(B)6=0 µ(B) ln µ(B). The generalized
fractal dimensions are numerically estimated through a
linear regression of

1
q − 1

ln Zǫ(q)

against ln ǫ for q 6= 1, and similarly through a linear
regression of Z1,ǫ against log ǫ for q = 1. For example,
we show how to obtain the Dq spectrum using the slope of
the linear regression in FIG. 4. D1 is called information
dimension and D2 is called correlation dimension. The
Dq of the positive values of q give relevance to the regions
where the measure is large, i.e., to the K-strings with
high probability. The Dq of the negative values of q deal
with the structure and the properties of the most rareﬁed
regions of the measure.

Some sets of physical interest have a nonanalytic de-
pendence of Dq on q. Moreover, this phenomenon has
a direct analogy to the phenomenon of phase transi-
tions in condensed-matter physics [38]. The existence
and type of phase transitions might turn out to be a
worthwhile characterisation of universality classes for the
structures [39]. The concept of phase transition in multi-
fractal spectra was introduced in the study of logistic
maps, Julia sets and other simple systems. Evidence
of phase transition was found in the multifractal spec-
trum of diﬀusion-limited aggregation [40]. By following

the thermodynamic formulation of multifractal measures,
Canessa [32] derived an expression for the ’analogous’ spe-
ciﬁc heat as

Cq ≡ −

∂2τ (q)
∂q2 ≈ 2τ (q) − τ (q + 1) − τ (q − 1).

(13)

He showed that the form of Cq resembles a classical phase
transition at a critical point for ﬁnancial time series. In
the next section, we discuss the property of Cq for our
measure representations of organisms.

And the complete sequences of some chromosomes of
non-bacteria organisms are also currently available. In
order to discuss the classiﬁcation problem of bacteria. We
also selected the sequences of Chromosome 15 of Saccha-
romyces cerevisiae, Chromosome 3 of Plasmodium falci-
parum, Chromosome 1 of Caenorhabditis elegans, Chro-
mosome 2 of Arabidopsis thaliana and Chromosome 22
of Homo sapiens.

We obtained the dimension spectra and ’analogous’
speciﬁc heat of the measure representations of the above
organisms and used them to discuss the classiﬁcation
problem. We calculated the dimension spectra and ’anal-
ogous’ speciﬁc heat of chromosome 22 of Homo sapiens
for K = 1, ...,8, and found that the Dq and Cq curves
of K = 6, 7, 8 are very close to one another (see FIG. 5
and 6). Hence it seems appropriate to use the measure
corresponding to K = 8. For K = 8, we calculated the
dimension spectra, ’analogous’ speciﬁc heat and the ex-
ponent β of the measure representations of all the above

organisms. As an illustration, we plot the Dq curves of M.
genitalium, Chromosome 15 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Chromosome 3 of Plasmodium falciparum, Chromosome
2 of Arabidopsis thaliana and Chromosome 22 of Homo
sapiens in FIG. 7; and the Cq curves of these organisms
in FIG. 8. Because all Dq are equal to 1 for the com-
plete random sequence, from these plots, it is apparent
that the Dq and Cq curves are nonlinear and signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from those of the completely random sequence.
From FIG. 7, we can claim that the curves representative
of the organisms are clearly distinct from the curve rep-
resenting a random sequence. From the plot of Dq, the
dimension spectra of organisms exhibit a multifractal-
like form. From FIG. 4, we can see the linear ﬁts of
q = −2, −1, 1, 2 are perfect and better than that of other
values of q, Hence we suggest to use D−2, D−1, D1, D2 in
the comparison of diﬀerent bacteria. We give the numer-
ical results for D−2, D−1, D1, D2 in Table I (from top to
bottom, in the increasing order of the value of D−1).

If only a few bacteria are considered at a time, we
can use the Dq curve to distinguish them. This strat-
egy is clearly not eﬃcient when a large number of or-
ganisms are to be distinguished. For this purpose, we
suggest to use D−1, D1 and D−2, in conjunction with
two-dimensional points (D−1, D1) or three-dimensional
points (D−1, D1, D−2). We give the distribution of
two-dimensional points (D−1, D1) and three-dimensional
points (D−1, D1, D−2) of bacteria in FIG. 9.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The idea of our measure representation is similar to the
portrait method proposed by Hao et al. [25]. It provides
a simple yet powerful visualisation method to amplify
the diﬀerence between a DNA sequence and a random
sequence as well as to distinguish DNA sequences them-
If a DNA sequence is random,
selves in more details.
then our measure representation yields a uniform mea-
sure (Dq = 1, Cq = 0).

From the measure representation and the values of Dq
and Cq, it is seen that there exists a clear diﬀerence be-
tween the DNA sequences of all organisms considered
here and the completely random sequence. Hence we
can conclude that complete genomes are not random se-
quences.

We obtained the values of the exponent β of our
measure representations (β = 0.393003 for V. cholerae,
β = 0.311623 for A. pernix, β = 0.240601 for X. fastid-
iosa, β = 0.381293 for T. pallidum, β = 0.334057 for C.
pneumoniae AR39, and β is larger than 0.4 for all other
bacteria selected). These values are far from 0. Hence
when we view our measure representations of organisms
as time series, they are far from being random time se-
ries, and in fact exhibit strong long-range correlation.
Here the long-range correlation is for the K-strings with
the dictionary ordering, and it is diﬀerent from the base

4

pair correlations introduced by other people.

Although the existence of the archaebacterial urking-
dom has been accepted by many biologists, the classi-
ﬁcation of bacteria is still a matter of controversy [41].
The evolutionary relationship of the three primary king-
doms, namely archeabacteria, eubacteria and eukaryote,
is another crucial problem that remains unresolved [41].
When K is large (K ≥ 6), our measure representa-
tion contains rich information on the complete genomes.
From FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, we ﬁnd the curves of Dq and
Cq are very close to one another for K = 6, 7, 8. Hence,
for the classiﬁcation problem, it would be appropriate to
take K = 8. We calculated the β, Dq and Cq values of
all organisms selected in this paper for K = 8. We found
that the Dq spectra of all organisms are multifractal-
like and suﬃciently smooth so that the Cq curves can be
meaningfully estimated. From FIG. 5, with the decreas-
ing of K, the multifractality becomes less severe. With
K = 8, we found that the Cq curves of all other bac-
teria resemble a classical phase transition at a critical
point similar to that of M. genitalium shown in FIG. 8.
But the ’analogous’ phase transitions of non-bacteria or-
ganisms are diﬀerent. Apart from Chromosome 1 of C.
elegans, they exhibit the shape of double-peaked speciﬁc
heat function which is known to appear in the Hubbard
model within the weak-to-strong coupling regime [42].

It is seen that the Dq curve is not clear enough to dis-
tinguish many bacteria themselves. In order to solve this
problem we use two-dimensional points (D−1, D1) and
three-dimensional points (D−1, D1, D−2). From FIG.9,
it is clear that bacteria roughly gather into two classes
(as shown in Table I). Using the distance among the
points, one can obtain a classiﬁcation of bacteria.

From Table I, we can see all Archaebacteria belong to
the same class except M. jannaschii. And four Chlamy-
dia almost gather together. It is surprised that the closest
pairs of bacteria, Helicobacter pylori J99 and Helicobacter
pylori 26695, Neisseria meningitidis MC58 and Neisse-
ria meningitidis Z2491, group with each other. Two hy-
perthermophilic bacteria group with each other and are
linked with the Archaebacteria. It has previously been
shown that Aquifex has close relationship with Archae-
bacteria from the gene comparison of an enzyme needed
for the synthesis of the amino acid trytophan [43] and us-
ing the length sequence of complete genome [23]. In gen-
eral, Bacteria that are close phylogenetically are almost
close in the spaces (D−1, D1) and (D−1, D1, D−2).

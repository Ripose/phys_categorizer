The behaviour of a system of ion channels formed across the cell mem-
brane is presented. The inﬁnite number of channels with an inﬁnite cou-
pling is introduced ﬁrst as a reference point for the detailed derivation of
the thermal-equilibrium probability distribution and the classiﬁcation of
the phase transitions. Fluctuations in a ﬁnite system are discussed next.
We propose a new, step-like model of the ion channel switching, for which
we provide the analytical results. The relation of this model to experiment
is also provided. Finally, the master equation for the ﬁnite channel-number
membrane is analysed numerically with the help of an exact-diagonalization

1. Introduction

All living cells are eﬀectively separated from the environment by the
lipids that constitute the cell membrane. The lipid bilayer formation and
its dynamics have been recently objects of an intensive molecular dynamics
studies [1]. However, ions such as sodium Na+ or potassium K+ can interact
with proteins in the cell membrane that transport the ions across the mem-
brane. Ion channels are one of the three types of proteins involved in the
ion transport; the others are the pumps and the carriers. Approximately,
an equal portion of the ionic current passes through each of these routes [2].
Classic experiments using the patch clamp technique showed an inter-
esting stochastic behaviour of the ion channels that is controlled by the
voltage across the membrane [3]. For example, this behaviour is crucial for
the phenomena of neural excitability [4]. The fractal model of ion channel
kinetics was formulated [5] and widely discussed in relation to the Markov

model [6]. Recently, Kramers’ diﬀusion theory has been considered as an
alternative to those models [7]. One should also mention a signiﬁcant im-
provement in the data analysis [8] namely, a new method was developed
for the identiﬁcation of deterministic structure in the time series, such as
obtained from the patch clamp experiments, and successfully applied to the
hearth disease and the epilepsy research.

In all above experimental and theoretical analyses, the kinetics of the
single ion-channel was investigated. In this paper we discuss collective ef-
fects in both inﬁnite-size system (Sec. 3), and realistic system (Sec. 4-6) of a
few-hundred coupled ion channels along the cell membrane. We discuss the
so-called step-like empirical model of the ion-channel switching aﬀected by
the voltage across the membrane that is based on that proposed by Hodgkin
and Huxley [4], but is much simpler and approximately rationalises the ex-
perimental data for the potassium and the sodium channels [9].

2. Model and the physical system

In this section we discus a simple model of ion channel switching and

apply it to the system of m-channels across the membrane (see Fig. 1).

The ion channels are formed by speciﬁc membrane proteins which un-
dergo a spontaneous, voltage-sensing conformational transitions between the
open and the closed states [10]. Hereinafter, we will concentrate on isolated
assembly of m ion channels of one type, i.e. potassium K+. Let us suppose
the simplest 2-state Markov model of the single channel switching (this is
not a strict supposition, because such a model is equivalent to the m+1 -
state Markov model of the whole membrane, cf. Sec. 4). In this model such
a channel is characterised by two microscopic parameters determined by
the voltage Vm across the membrane: the inverse average open- and closed
times (λopen = λopen (Vm), and λclosed = λclosed (Vm), respectively). Physi-
cally, parameters λopen and λclosed are measured indirectly in a time series
obtained from patch clamp experiment for single channel [3], whereas Vm
is the driving parameter controlled in such an experiment. Subsequently,
the expectation value of the fraction of opened channels
obey the
two-state, “open-closing” dynamics [4]:

− h

For the sake of convenience, one can deﬁne the decay constant λ = λopen +
λclosed (that provides natural timescale of the processes), and the probability
of single channel open popen = λopen/λ, which allow us to rewrite eq. (1) in
form:

= popen − h

In further considerations, parameter λ = λ (Vm) is regarded as constant,
and used to deﬁne the dimensionless time:

τ = λt.

One can verify this approximation for a broad range of voltage across the
membrane Vm by looking at the experimental data (see Table 1). With this
simpliﬁcation, only one microscopic parameter popen (Vm) remains.

Our starting assumptions, concerning the electrical properties of the
membrane (see Fig. 1), are as follows: (i) the conductance of the membrane
is directly proportional to the number of open channels, i.e. its resistivity

After introducing all above suppositions, a direct application of the Kir-
choﬀ’s laws to the electric circuit shown in Fig. 1 proves its equivalence to
the eﬀective circuit, which contains only an assembly of switching channels
coupled to the external voltage Veﬀ and the resistivity Reﬀ :

The calculation of the relation between the voltage across the membrane
Vm and the fraction of open channels nopen for the eﬀective electric circuit
is straightforward and yields

(4)

(5)

Vm =

Veﬀ
1 + nopenReﬀ /Rm

.

This allows us to consider the probability of a single channel open as a
function popen = popen (nopen), since Vm is a function of nopen (5). Moreover,
instead of applying phenomenological models of single channel switching
popen (Vm), such that proposed by Hodgkin and Huxley [4], we can now
consider indirectly a model function popen (nopen), describing the assembly
of coupled ion channels themselves.

Namely, for a qualitative analysis of the membrane, one can select any
model function popen (nopen) that retains principal properties of physical
system, such as negative feedback (which means that channel remains closed
for high polarising voltage Vm and open for low, see [9]), and have convenient
analytical properties. In Sec. 4-6 we apply the step-like function

popen (nopen) =

1 + eB(n0−nopen)

(cid:17)

,

where B and n0 are adjustable parameters, which allow us to perform some
integrations analytically. A brief comparison of the model of channel switch-
ing deﬁned by the function (6) with some of available experimental data [9]
are provided in Fig. 2. Strictly speaking, the relation inverse to (5) per-
mitted us to write the probability of channel open as a function of voltage

In eﬀect, the selection of the probability of channel open in the form (6)
constitutes the step-like model, which, as we just shown, rationalises the
experimental data of Ref. [9].

3. Deterministic system: long-range coupled inﬁnite membrane

In this section we consider the limiting case of the membrane with inﬁ-
nite number of channels (m
), and far from a critical point [11]. For
such a system one can suppose that the probability distribution is narrow
and, subsequently, the fraction of open channels nopen is close to its aver-
. With this assumption (which will be veriﬁed in
age value nopen ≈ h
the next section), we can write down an approximate version of Eq. (2) as
follows

nopeni

→ ∞

d
dτ

nopen = popen (nopen)

nopen,

−

(9)

where τ is a dimensionless time (3). Equation (9) becomes exact in limit
m
(except in the case when the system undergoes the 2-nd order
phase transition), as a mean-ﬁeld solution of the systems with the inﬁnite
coupling [11].

→ ∞

For all the models of ion channel switching [9], qualitatively similar to
that deﬁned by (6), eq. (9) could have from one to three stationary solutions
nopen(τ ) = n∗, that obey the relation (cf. Fig. 3)

popen (n∗) = n∗.

(10)

For each of these solutions, one can consider its stability against small ﬂuc-
tuations nopen = n∗ + δn, by making a proper linearization of the relation

where p′
∗ is the ﬁrst derivative of the probability as a function of the fraction
of open channels: p′
open (n∗). The equation (11), after substituting to
the dynamical eq. (9) provides us with an approximate result (for δn << 1):

This result simply means, that the ﬁrst derivative of the probability p′
∗ in
the stationary point n∗ deﬁned by the relation (10), allows us to identify
stable (for p′
∗ < 1) and unstable (for p′
∗ < 1) stationary solutions of the
dynamical eq. (9) (see Fig. 3). The threshold value p′
∗ = 1 will be shown to
correspond with the critical point in terms of 2-nd order phase transition in
the next section.

The approach presented above provides us two equivalent stable solu-
tions (see Fig. 3). In the next section we will start the considerations for
ﬁnite number of channels m, and will verify (in Sec. 5) one of these stable
points to be actually metastable, with a ﬁnite decay time growing exponen-
tially with m.

4. Stationary probability distribution for a ﬁnite membrane

Let us consider the ﬁnite, m ion channel cell membrane, and the evo-
, (where k = 0, . . . , m is the
lution of its probability distribution P =
k Pk = 1 is
number of open channels, and the normalization condition
satisﬁed) in time. All the probability ﬂows between k-th point and two
neighbouring points are shown symbolically on Fig. 4.

k = 1. Eq. (14) provides the pow-
adjusted to conserve normalization
erful tool for estimating numerically the stationary probability distribution
for m-channel system with given model of ion channel switching popen(n).
Moreover, in Appendix A, using Eq. (14), we discuss small ﬂuctuations
around the stationary solutions (10) for a general model popen(n).

P

The numerical results, presented in Fig. 5, as well as an approximate
formula for small ﬂuctuations (A.8), derived in App. A, suggest the approx-
imate analytical way of solving detail balance equations for large m. In this
limit, one can look for universal function f (k/m), such that

P0(n) = em(f (n)+Cm).

In Eq. (15) we deﬁne a quasi-continuous variables: fraction of open channels
n = k/m, and the stationary probability distribution function P0(n), deﬁned
by relation P (0)
k = P0(k/m)∆n, where ∆n = 1/m. Cm is an adjustable
parameter, so that function P0(n) (15) satisfy the normalization condition

In particular, when looking for extrema of the function f (n) (the condi-

probability distribution function P0(n) (15), Eq. (19) reduces to the con-
dition for stationary solutions of the deterministic equation of motion (9)
n∗ = popen(n∗) (see Sec. 3). This provides the link between these two ap-

Here we will concentrate only on the isothermal ensemble (Θ = 1), [12]. The
deﬁnition (21) allows us to identify the candidates for 1-st and 2-nd order
phase transitions (cf. Fig.6) in terms of Ginzburg-Landau theory [11]. How-
ever, when the parameter B is constant and n0 varies, the conﬁgurational
does not change when the fraction of
entropy of the system Sconf = ln
open channels n switch between two equivalent minima at the point n = 0.5,
(cid:17)
so this process also has to be considered as the 2-nd order phase transitions
within the Ehrenfest classiﬁcation scheme. The remarkable feature of this
case is possible existence of a metastable state (cf. Fig.6), that motivated
us to study the dynamics of the system in the next section.

5. Dynamics of the probability distribution via an exact

diagonalization

In this section we derive the system of dynamical equations (the master
equation), which describe time evolution of the probability distribution of
the number of open channels for the m-channel membrane. We will also
present results obtained when solving this system by using the numerical
exact diagonalization technique. These results are substantial for further
considerations, i.e. they are used to justify the approximate approach pro-
posed in Sec. 6 for large systems.

Let us consider a discrete probability distribution for the m-channel
membrane (Pk), where k = 0, . . . , m is the number of open channels, and
k Pk = 1 is satisﬁed (see Sec. 4). Taking into
the normalization condition
account probability ﬂows between the k-th point and its two neighbours
k
1, k + 1 (see Fig. 4) one can write down the system of linear, ordinary
diﬀerential equations:

The system (23) can be simpliﬁed by the rescaling Lk = Pk/αk, where

for k = 0, . . . , m (cf. Sec. 4), and adjust α0 appropriately. That form will
be suitable for e.g. perturbation approach (see Sec. 6). In terms of variables

the matrix [Bkl] can be diagonalized with standard numerical packages [13],

up to m

as long as τ

have substantial meaning for searching metastable states for a large system

We have applied the step-like model of ion channel switching (6) in
symmetric (B = 5, n0 = 0.5) as well as asymmetric (B = 5, n0 = 0.49)

P (0)
and 50% of narrow-peaked distri-
stationary probability distribution
k
bution, concentrated in secondary maximum of the stationary distribution
(cid:16)
(see. Fig. 5). Two characteristics periods have been identiﬁed in the time
evolution of m = 400 channels membrane, in both symmetric and asym-
metric case: (i) a fast diﬀusion from the initial conditions to metastable
solution (see Fig. 7), and (ii) a slow relaxation to the stationary solution.
Both of these features are shown in Fig. 7. Our quantitative observations
for the membranes with diﬀerent numbers of channels m can be brieﬂy re-
ported as follows: the time of diﬀusion (i) was found to be approximately
constant for m = 100
400, whereas the life time of the metastable solution
(ii) grows rapidly with m. Moreover, for large systems, the shape of the
probability distribution remains exactly constant for a long period of time,
104 for m = 400, that correspond to the real time approx.
i.e. τ = 102
0.2

÷
20 s (see Table 1).

According to these results, one can expect a broad window in the spec-
trum of eigenvalues (ωk) of the dynamical system (23). Spectra presented in
Fig. 9 conﬁrm clearly this hypothesis, for both the symmetric and the asym-
metric cases. Moreover, ﬁrst excited-state eigenvalue ω1 increases exponen-
tially with the number of channels m, (except of the numerical round-oﬀ
errors, which become signiﬁcant for ω1 < 10−12), whereas all the other
excited-state eigenvalues lie in approximately constant (for diﬀerent m)
band bordered by the eigenvalues ω2 and ωm. This simple picture proves,
that for the m-s of order few hundreds and larger, the dynamics of the prob-
ability distribution (Pk) is completely determined by ﬁrst eigenvalue ω1 and
associated eigenvector P (1) =
100 (that
correspond to the real time approx. 0.2 s).

distribution is not always maximal, for same cases entropy SSh can decrease
as a function of time (see e.g. Fig. 11). This is caused by the fact, that we
are studying a dissipative system, connected to the environment (see Sec. 2),
whereas only the total entropy of the system together with its environment
grows in time, not necessarily the fractional entropy of the membrane (i.e.
Shanon entropy).

Observations discussed in this section, particularly the simple structure
of the eigenvalue spectrum (presented on Fig. 9), gave us the motivation
for some approximate approach for the ﬁrst-excited eigenvalue ω1, that is
discussed in the next section.

Let us consider the membrane with large number of channels (m =
1000, e.g.) and a metastable solution for the fraction of open channels
200
nM clearly separated from the stable nS (in other words: secondary and
primary maximum of the stationary probability distribution, see i.e. Fig. 5.)
by an unstable point nU (and corresponding minimum of the stationary
probability distribution, see Fig. 5, e.g.). For this case, according to the
broad window in the spectrum of eigenvalues found in Sec. 5. (see Fig. 9.),
the distribution function P (n) relax nearly independently in sections n < nS
and n > nS after a time deﬁned by second excited eigenvalue
1/ω2, and
1/ω1 (where ω1 is ﬁrst excited eigenvalue)
then, after a time of order
the probability start to ﬂow through the unstable point nU , what let the
distribution function P (n) to relax to the stationary solution P0(n), see
Fig. 7-8. Motivated by this brief summary of the results presented in Sec. 5.,

is an approximation of ﬁrst excited eigenvalue ω1. This approximation is
essentially equivalent to the ﬁrst-order perturbation correction to the ω1, if
we consider the connection in point nU as a perturbation.

Moreover, one can consider the stationary probability distribution in
the limit form, for large m (15), and make the Gaussian approximation to
calculate all the integrals. The practical formula, obtained in this manner

where fM and fU are values of the function f (n) (see Sec. 4) in point
nM and nU , respectively, can be compared indirectly with numerical exact-
diagonalization results. Although the coeﬃcient in the linear part of the
fU ) log e = 0.01557 and 0.008597, for symmetric (B = 5,
eq. (34) (fM −
n0 = 0.5) and asymmetric (B = 5, n0 = 0.49) Fermi-Dirac model of the
ion channel switching, approximately agree with corresponding numerical
values obtained from exact-diagonalization (see Fig. 9), the term log m/2
simply does not exists in numerics. This clear contradiction seems to be the
immanent disadvantage of the perturbation approach to our system, that

simply produce too large value of the step ∆U in eq. (29). Moreover, it
cannot be repaired in any perturbation scheme, because, what was shown
numerically, the second perturbation correction to the ﬁrst excited eigen-
value ω1 produce nonphysical negative results.

mula for log ω1 obtained from exact diagonalization. Although the frozen
diﬀusion approach produce the results agreeable with the numerics, the
physical reasons for introducing parameter τdiﬀ are not clear at this stage;
the problem needs a further study, possibly with utilising the Real-Space
Renormalization Group Technique.

Summary

We derived the detail-balance equations for stationary probability dis-
tribution of the number of open ion channels in the cell membrane. This
equation was used to compare the extrema of the stationary probability
distribution for large m-channel system with corresponding stationary so-
, and to discuss
lutions of the deterministic dynamical equation for m
the ﬂuctuation around them for ﬁnite m.

The so-called step-like model of ion channel switching, based on that
studied by Hodgkin and Huxley [4], was brieﬂy discussed in relation to the
experimental data, applied to obtain an analytical solution of the detail-
balance equation, qualitative discussion of the two classes of phase transi-
tions in the system, and numerical exact-diagonalization calculations of the
decay time of the metastable state of the system. The exact diagonalization
results were shown to disagree with the ﬁrst-order perturbations. Moreover,
the perturbation scheme produces unphysical results in the second order.
This contradiction shows essentially a non-perturbative character of coupled
ion-channel system. The proposed frozen diﬀusion approach, with an addi-
tional adjustable parameter, was shown to explain the exact diagonalization
results.

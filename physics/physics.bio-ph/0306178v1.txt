Abstract

We study the steady state properties of a genotype selection model in presence

of correlated Gaussian white noise. The eﬀect of the noise on the genotype selection

model is discussed. It is found that correlated noise can break the balance of gene

selection and induce the phase transition which can makes us select one type gene

haploid from a gene group.

Key words: Genotype Selection Model, Correlated noise, Fokker-Planck equation.

Introduction

Recently, nonlinear stochastic systems with noise terms have attracted extensive inves-

tigations. The concept of noise-induced transition has got wide applications in the ﬁeld

of physics, chemistry and biology [1][2][3]. In most of these theories the noise aﬀects the

dynamics through system variable, i.e., the noise is multiplication in nature[4]. The focal

theme of these investigations is steady state properties of systems in which ﬂuctuations,

generally applied from outside, are considered independent of the system’s characteris-

tic dissipation. These studies consider only one type of ﬂuctuations that aﬀect system’s

parameters, i.e., they drive multiplicatively. However, ﬂuctuations due to some extrin-

sic factors aﬀect the system directly , i.e., they drive system dynamics additively. Since

two types of ﬂuctuations have the common origin, they correlated with each other in the

relevant timescale of the problem[5]. On the level of a Langevin-type description of a

dynamical system, the presence of correlation between noise can change the dynamics of

the system[6][7]. Correlated noise processes have found applications in a broad range of

studies such as steady state properties of a single mode laser [8], bistable kinetics[9], di-

rected motion in spatially symmetric periodic potentials[10], stochastic resonance in linear

systems[11], and steady state entropy production[12]. In this paper we study the genotype

selection model in presences of the correlated noise and discuss how noise correlation can

break the balance of the gene selection and induce the phase transition.

2 The simple genotype selection model

We select a haploid group as our object and suppose that each haploid may have gene A

or gene B[13]. The number of gene A haploid, gene B haploid and the total are NA,NB

and N ,respectively. Because the total number is constant (N = NA + NB=constant), we

can make a transform as follow:

x =

NA
N

x is the ratio of gene A number to the total number. If gene A haploid and gene B

haploid may have a mutation (A

and the ratio of A

B and B

A are mA∆t and mB∆t, respectively, we can get the

following diﬀerence equation:

On the other hand, on account of self-sow each gene haploid has its rebirth rate:

NA(t + ∆t) = ωANA(t), NB(t + ∆t) = ωBNB(t)

Where ωA = 1 + St
generations. From Eq.(1) and Eq.(3) we can get:

Considering Eq.(2) and Eq.(4) together we can get the diﬀerential equation of x(t) at

the case of ∆t

Where β = mB, γ = mA + mB, µ = St

mA + mB = 1. So the simpliﬁed gene selection dynamic equation is shown as following

Now if due to some environmental external disturbance the gene selection rate of the

haploid, it is likely to aﬀect both β and µ in the form of additive and multiplicatively

noises that are connected through a correlation parameter. In other words the external

ﬂuctuations aﬀect the parameter µ which ﬂuctuates around a mean value, thus generating

multiplicative noise and at the same time environmental ﬂuctuations perturbs the dynam-

ics directly which gives rise to additive noise. So We have

We can derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for evolution of Steady Proba-

In the Fig.1, we study the eﬀect of the selection rate µ on SPDF. When the selection

−

rate is zero (µ = 0), the curve is symmetry. It is said that gene A haploid (x) and gene B

haploid (1

x) have the same probability distribution. If the selection rate get a negative

value the peak of the curve is biased to the left. It is evident that the selection is unfair

which is propitious to gene B haploid. On the other hand, the selection is propitious to

gene A in case of µ > 0. In order to study the eﬀect of the noise on the system easily we

adopt the symmetrical case for the following discussion.

and D=0.5,2.0 and 8.0, respectively. (units are relative)

In Fig.(2) we show the eﬀect of multiplicative noise on SPDF. For a small value of

D the curve shows a single peak (at x = 0.5) region which indicates that environmental

selection gives the same chance to both gene A haploid and gene B haploid and it is not

easy for us to select one type haploid from the group. As the value of D increases, the

single peak region vanishes and it evolves a double peak region. The left peak is near the

position x = 0 while the right one is near the position x = 1, which shows that environment

selection gives a absolute big chance to one of the two (gene A or gene B). In this case

it is easy to select one type haploid from the group since the other type haploid number

can be neglected with regard to the selected type number. On the other hand, from the

Fig.2 we can know that the multiplicative noise can induce the phase transition from one

peak to double peak.

The eﬀect of the additive noise on SPDF is shown as Fig.3. For a small value of α the

curve represents a single peak region which vanishes for larger value of α. The position

of the peak is weakly aﬀected by the strength of α, however, its height may be aﬀected

intensively by α. It is said that the additive noise can not separate the single peak while

it can make the peak disappear as a diﬀuse term.

The curve of the Fig.4 shows the eﬀect of correlation parameter on SPDF. When λ

is zero, namely no correlation, the curve gives one peak region whose peak position is at

x = 0.5 which shows that the selection is fair to both gene A haploid and gene B haploid.

As the value of λ increases the peak at x = 0.5 vanishes gradually and ﬁnally it becomes

a concave peak. At the same time, the height of the curve at the both side becomes

larger gradually. In others word, the noise correlation make the probability distribution

centralize on both sides (x = 0 and x = 1). It is evident that the noise correlation make

it possible to separate one type haploid from a haploid group.

4 Conclusion and Summary

In this paper, the steady state properties of the gene selection model is investigated in

presence of the correlated Gaussian white noise. We study the eﬀect of the white noise on

SPDF in the symmetrical case. The multiplicative noise can break the single peak state to

the double peak state (see Fig.2), which indicates that the selection in the case is prepon-

derant for one of the two ( gene A or gene B). The additive noise play a diﬀusing role in

the process, which causes the probabilities distribution to a equal distribution. The noise

correlation can also break the symmetry of AB, which induces the especial gene haploid

to be selected.

From the above, it is found that the noise can change the nature selection from a equal

probability selection to a diﬀerential probability one, which beneﬁts us to select one type

haploid from the haploid group. The breaking of the symmetry and the especial gene

On the other hand, the stochastic force can induce the phase transition in our system.

This viewpoint is completely novel as the traditional viewpoint thinks the stochastic force

disturbs the phase transition.

We have micromachined a silicon-chip device that trans-
ports DNA with a Brownian ratchet that rectiﬁes the Brown-
ian motion of microscopic particles. Transport properties for a
DNA 50mer agree with theoretical predictions, and the DNA
diﬀusion constant agrees with previous experiments. This
type of micromachine could provide a generic pump or sepa-
ration component for DNA or other charged species as part
of a microscale lab-on-a-chip. A device with reduced feature
size could produce a size-based separation of DNA molecules,
with applications including the detection of single nucleotide
polymorphisms.

I. INTRODUCTION

more extensive presentation of the experimental results
for a variety devices and oligomer sizes are available else-
where [25].

The Human Genome Project aims to provide the com-
plete sequence of the 3 billion base-pairs of the human
genome. While the dominant method for analyzing DNA
fragments remains gel electrophoresis, new technologies
that have the potential to increase the rate and decrease
the cost of DNA sequencing and analysis, such as mass
spectrometry and hybridization arrays, are critical to the
project’s success [1].

Here we describe a novel method of DNA transport and
separation based on a Brownian ratchet. As described
originally by Smoluchowski and noted by Feynman, a
Brownian particle can undergo net transport on a poten-
tial energy surface that is externally driven to ﬂuctuate
between several distinct states [2,3]. Brownian ratchets
have attracted theoretical attention [4–12] due to their
description of molecular motors [13–15] and to their sim-
ilarity with phenomena termed stochastic resonance and
resonance activation [16,17].

Brownian ratchets have been demonstrated to trans-
port µm- to mm-sized particles using dielectrophoresis
[18], optical tweezers [19], and electrocapillary forces [20]
to generate ratchets. Other devices based on entropic
ratchets [21] or physical barriers [22,23] have been pro-
posed as well. More recently, a geometrical sieve device
has been used to separate phospholipids [24].

Despite these successes, the Brownian ratchet mecha-
nism has not before proved capable of transporting DNA
fragments in the size ranges applicable to DNA sequenc-
ing (< 1000 nt) because the interactions used to estab-
lish the ratchet potential were too weak. In contrast to
previous devices using polarization interactions to gen-
erate ratchets [18,19], we have fabricated a device that
uses charge-charge interactions to generate the ratchet
potential. As seen below, the charge-charge interactions
have suﬃcient strength to establish ratchets that can trap
small DNA fragments.

The ratchet-like wells that trap DNA are generated by
charging a series of patterned electrodes. When the elec-
trodes are discharged, the traps vanish and the molecules
undergo Brownian motion. Next the potential is re-
applied, and the particles again collect in the traps. A
spatial asymmetry in the shape of each ratchet-shaped
well rectiﬁes the Brownian motion and produces net
transport as the on-oﬀ cycle is repeated. Each molecule’s
transport rate depends on its diﬀusion constant, allowing
the possibility of size-based separations. We have imple-
mented the device by microfabrication on a silicon chip.
This report describes the Brownian ratchet theory,
provides a derivation of the transport rate, and presents
experimental results for a single sized DNA oligomer.

II. THEORY AND METHODS

A silicon wafer with six micromachined devices is
shown in Fig. 1, with a schematic design below. The
electric potential that creates the ratcheting traps is gen-
erated by two arrays of interdigitated electrodes that are
perpendicular to the transport axis. The two sets of ar-
rays each extend from bond pads on opposite sides of the
device. The spacing between electrodes extending from
the same bond pad is l. The asymmetric pattern creates
r, between electrodes
two diﬀerent spacings, r and l
extending from opposite bond pads. The smaller spacing
r deﬁnes the feature size of the device.

−

As shown in also shown in Fig. 1, a simpliﬁed one-
dimensional description of the potential approximates
the electrodes as inﬁnitely thin wires. To simplify the
theoretical model, we have neglected the ﬁnite width of
the electrode, the dependence of the electric potential on
the distance normal to the surface, and the corresponding
detailed calculation of the potential along the transport
axis.

When a voltage diﬀerence V is applied across the two
electrode arrays during the on-state, with duration ton,
sawtooth-shaped ratcheting traps are created for charged
particles. The electrodes are discharged to V = 0 during
the oﬀ-state, with duration toﬀ , and particles undergo
isotropic Brownian diﬀusion. When the potential is re-
applied, the particles are again trapped in potential wells.
The times ton and toﬀ are within the low-frequency, quasi-
static approximation; nonadiabatic eﬀects and current
reversals, reported elsewhere [26,27], are not applicable
in this regime. Due to the asymmetry of the sawtooth
shape and the choice of toﬀ , a particle starting from well
0 has a measurable probability to be trapped in well 1
and virtually zero probability to be trapped in well
1.
Transport can be generated by repetitive cycling between
the on-state and the oﬀ-state. The transport properties
of a particle are determined by its diﬀusion constant D
and its charge Q, along with the thermal energy kBT and
the device parameters deﬁned previously.

−

Each cycle begins by applying the potential V for a
time ton that is suﬃcient to localize particles at the bot-
toms of the trapping wells. A particle at the barrier-top
drifts down the side of the sawtooth of length l
r to ﬁnd
the bottom of the well, which deﬁnes the time required
for complete trapping,

r)2kBT /QV D ,

according to overdamped Brownian motion. At the end
of the trapping, the particle distribution at the bottom of
a well is assumed to be much narrower than the feature
size r.

In the next phase of the cycle, the potential is turned
oﬀ for time toﬀ . When the potential is re-applied, parti-
cles that have diﬀused further than the barrier to the left
(roughly distance l away) will hop to the previous well,
and particles that have diﬀused further than the barrier
to the right (roughly distance r away) will be transported
l, we can choose an intermedi-
to the next well. Since r
l2/2D and particles
ate time toﬀ such that toﬀ r2/2D
always move right, never left.

To compute the probability α that a particle moves
one well to the right in a single cycle, we note that the
eﬀective distance reﬀ it must travel is between r (the
inner edge-to-edge distance between electrodes) and 3r
(the outer edge-to-edge distance). The probability dis-
tribution (or equivalently the Greens function) for a par-
ticle starting at the origin undergoing one-dimensional
Brownian motion for time toﬀ is

P (x; toﬀ ) =

exp[

An expression for α is then obtained by integrating
P (x; toﬀ ) from reﬀ to inﬁnity:

of 1/2 when back-diﬀusion is neglected. The ﬂux in units
of the characteristic time tr is αtr/(ton+toﬀ ) and is shown
for ton = toﬀ /3. The ﬂux is non-monotonic and exhibits
tr. Other voltage modulations

more complicated than the on-oﬀ pattern described here
are also possible and can change the direction of particle
ﬂow according to particle size [4]. Other similar types
of non-monotonic behavior have been termed stochastic
resonance and resonance activation [16,17] although they
may also be described by dispersion and linear response
[28].

Devices were fabricated from Pt, a non-reactive,
corrosion-resistant metal chosen to avoid electrolysis of
water, using relatively standard micromachining tech-
nologies [25]. The fabrication began with thermally oxi-
dized 100 mm diameter silicon wafers. A 200 ˚A thick Ti
layer was used as an adhesion layer between the subse-
quent Pt layer and the silicon dioxide. Next, a 200 nm
thick layer of Pt was deposited on top of the Ti. The
electrodes were deﬁned in the metal layers using pho-
tolithography and ion milling. For the devices used in
this work, the electrodes and the gaps between nearest
electrodes were 2 µm and the spatial period was 20µm.
Oligomers labeled with ﬂuorescent rhodamine dye
(Amitof Biotech Inc., Boston, MA) were placed on the
surface of the chip at 4 pmole/µl in deionized water. A
microscope slide cover glass (Macalaster Bicknell, New
Haven, CT) cut to size was used to conﬁne the solution
to a uniform thickness of approximately 10 µm. A seal-
ing compound was used to obtain a liquid tight seal along
the edges, leaving the ends open. Square wave modula-
tion (Synthesized Function Generator DS345, Stanford
Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA) with an amplitude of
1.6 V and oﬀset of 0.8 V (one set of electrodes at 0 V
and the second set at 1.6 V) was applied to the elec-
trodes to generate the ﬂashing ratchet potential. Fre-
quencies ranging from 0.7 Hz to 8 Hz were used, with a
ratio ton/toﬀ = 1/3.

mounted on an epi ﬂuorescence microscope (Zeiss Ax-

chip was illuminated using the output of a 50 W mer-
cury lamp ﬁltered with a green band pass ﬁlter. The
brightﬁeld ﬂuorescence was imaged through a red low
pass ﬁlter. The video images were recorded on video
tape and transferred to a PC using a composite color
PCI bus frame grabber (DT3153 Data Translation, Inc.,
Marlboro, MA). The ﬂuorescence intensity resulting from
the ﬂuorescently labeled DNA fragments was analyzed in

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Fig. 3 we show three images from a typical ex-
periment using a device with 2 µm electrodes and a
0.7 Hz switching frequency to transport a rhodamine-
labeled DNA 50mer. These images were saved during the
trapping phase of the cycle, and ﬂuorescence maxima are
clearly seen from DNA molecules captured on the posi-
tive electrodes. At the start of the experiment, the DNA
oligomers are focused on left-most three electrodes. As
the potential cycles between on and oﬀ states, the packet
moves to the right and broadens. The transport rate α
can be estimated by noting that the intensity maximum
moves from electrode 1 to electrode 3 after 10 cycles, then
to electrode 5 after 10 more cycles, yielding α
0.2. For
a more precise value, we extracted the intensity proﬁle
across the image, set a baseline at the 85th percentile of
intensity, calculated the average position x(n) from the
intensity above baseline, normalized x(n) by the 10-pixel
spacing between electrodes, then measured the slope of
x(n) to obtain α. For this experiment α = 0.18.

The square width also increases linearly with the num-
ber of cycles (data not shown); because we used a base-
line threshold that narrows the width of the distribution,
however, the formula of Eq. 4b no longer provides an
accurate relationship between σ2(n) and α.

Fig. 4 shows the experimental results for α, along with
1σ error bars from repeated runs. As predicted, α de-

creases with increasing frequency. Also shown in Fig. 4
is a theoretical curve from Eq. 3. Least-squares ﬁtting

A typical application requiring the separation of DNA
fragments is the analysis of single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs). An SNP is a position in the genome
where multiple nucleotides are likely. Characterizing ge-
netic diversity through SNPs has applications including
the identiﬁcation of genes for disease inheritance and sus-
ceptibility, the development of personalized medicines,
and the documentation of human evolutionary history
and migrations through a genetic record [30–33]. Prelim-
inary sets of thousands of SNPs, identiﬁed by the 12 nt
on either side of a polymorphism, have been reported
[34]. Validating and detecting these SNPs can be ac-
complished by resequencing speciﬁc 25 nt regions of the
genome.

Here we investigate the use of a Brownian ratchet de-
vice for the resequencing and detection application. Cal-
culations are based on a device with feature size r =
0.1 µm, periodicity 1 µm, and a potential diﬀerence of
0.1 V between electrodes in the on-state. We estimate the
eﬀective DNA diﬀusion constant D(r/reﬀ )2 from the the-
(length)−0.6
oretical scaling for a self-avoiding walk, D
[35,36], and our experimental results for the 50mer. The
persistence length of single-stranded DNA is 4 nm, or
13.6 nt [37], indicating that the self-avoiding walk should
be adequate (although not quantitative) for fragment
sizes we consider.

∼

The detection of an SNP requires, at most, the abil-
ity to sequence the 25 nt region surrounding the poly-
morphism, which can be accomplished by separating a

5

DNA 24mer from a 25mer respectively. Using the the-
oretical scaling of diﬀusion constant with DNA length,
10−8cm2/sec and
we extrapolate D(r/reﬀ )2 of 5.44
10−8cm2/sec for the 24mer and 25mer. The time
5.31
×
required to focus the DNA at the start of each cycle is
10−4sec. The optimized separation parame-
ton ≈
10−4sec
ters, calculated using Eq. 7, require toﬀ = 2.5
and 12,000 cycles for a total separation time of 5.4 sec
on a 1.25 cm chip.

In conclusion, we have fabricated a Brownian ratchet
device that is capable of transporting small DNA
molecules in aqueous solution, rather than the inconve-
nient gel and polymer solutions required for electrophore-
sis. This type of device could be used as a pump compo-
nent for transport or separation of charged species in a
microfabricated analysis chip. Multiple miniaturized de-
vices can also be arrayed side-by-side for high-throughput
operation. Based on experimental measurements, we
suggest the feasibility of using this type of device for bio-
logical applications, for example the validation of SNPs.

The diﬀusion constant of dye-labeled 30mer on quartz
was measured to be approximately 2.6× smaller than
the free-solution value of 6.2×10−7cm2/sec. Similarly, the
diﬀusion constant of the bare dye was 7× smaller than
the bulk value of 2.8×10−6cm2/sec. We estimate the dif-
fusion constant of a 50mer based on the self-avoiding
walk scaling, D50mer/D30mer = (50/30)−0.6, which gives
D = 1.8 × 10−7cm2/sec.

FIG. 1. The Brownian ratchet device is

shown in
schematic. Modulating the electric potential at the electrodes
generates a ratchet-like potential energy surface for charged
molecules like DNA. Cycling the ratchet between an on-state
and an oﬀ-state generates transport.

FIG. 2. The probability α that a particle hops one well to
the right during a single cycle of device operation is shown
as a function of the ratio tr/toﬀ (black line). For large toﬀ , α
approaches 0.5 as we do not consider back-diﬀusion. The ﬂux
in units of the characteristic time tr is αtr/(ton + toﬀ ) and is
shown for ton = toﬀ /3 (grey line). The ﬂux is reminiscent of
a stochastic resonance with a maximum when toﬀ ≈ tr.

These images were saved during the trapping phase of the
cycle, and ﬂuorescence maxima are clearly seen from DNA
molecules captured on the positive electrodes. At the start of
the experiment, the DNA oligomers are focused on left-most
three electrodes. As the potential cycles between on and oﬀ
states, the packet moves to the right and broadens.

Abstract

Recent theoretical approaches to community structure and dynamics reveal that
many large-scale features of community structure (such as species-rank distributions
and species-area relations) can be explained by a so-called neutral model. Using
this approach, species are taken to be equivalent and trophic relations are not taken
into account explicitly. Here we provide a general analytic solution to the local
community model of Hubbell’s neutral theory of biodiversity by recasting it as an urn
model i.e. a Markovian description of states and their transitions. Both stationary
and time-dependent distributions are analysed. The stationary distribution — also
called the zero-sum multinomial — is given in closed form. An approximate form
for the time-dependence is obtained by using an expansion of the master equation.
The temporal evolution of the approximate distribution is shown to be a good
representation for the true temporal evolution for a large range of parameter values.

Keywords: Community dynamics, Hubbell’s neutral theory, abundance distribution,

1 Introduction

Understanding the global patterns of biodiversity and its dynamics at diﬀerent time scales
remains a great challenge for ecological science (Rosenzweig, 1995; Wilson, 2003). One
of the key features that deﬁnes community structure is the relation between range and
abundance. How the community structure develops in time and how species are spatially
distributed largely deﬁne the ﬁeld of macroecology (Brown, 1995). In this context, an
important step to unify biogeography and biodiversity has been achieved by Hubbell
(Hubbell, 2001; Bell, 2001) through the formulation of a neutral theory.

The mathematical framework employed by Hubbell allows for speciation processes to
be integrated with the MacArthur-Wilson theory of island biogeography. In this way, the
neutral theory predicts some universal features that can be tested by direct analysis of
species-abundance distributions and other large-scale measurements. In Hubbell’s theory,
two key quantities largely determine the steady-state distributions of species richness
(as well as relative species abundances on local and large geographic scales). These
two parameters are the so-called biodiversity number and the immigration (dispersal)
rate. Under Hubbell’s assumptions, the ecological properties of every individual in the
population are assumed to be identical.

In a neutral model of this type, individuals compete for the same pool of resources,
but chance events are responsible for the identity of the ﬁnal winner(s). The dynamics of
each species is thus path-dependent and a Markovian description of their time evolution
is appropriate. Under the assumption of a balance between birth, death and immigration
rates, the neutral theory is able to reproduce the quantitative patterns of species distri-
butions that are well known from the ecological literature. It also permits the generation
of several nontrivial and testable quantitative predictions about biodiversity and biogeog-
raphy. In particular, the theory predicts that rare species would typically be recent in
terms of their origination. In relation to conservation biology, a neutral community in
If
which species are essentially equal would be very ﬂuid, with frequent replacements.
true, protected areas should be larger than those expected for stable communities with
species closely adapted to given niches.

Formally, Hubbell’s theory is the ecological analog to the neutral theory of genetic drift
in genetics (Kimura, 1983; Ewens, 1972; Karlin and McGregor, 1972). Early attempts
to incorporate the neutral approach from population genetics (Caswell, 1976; Hubbell,
1979) mainly highlighted the relevance of drift in community dynamics, providing evi-
dence for a global view of ecosystems in which competitive forces, ecological niches, and
even trophic interactions could be ignored in the pursuit of a better understanding of
biodiversity dynamics. More recent work incorporated these ideas in an explicit way
(Hubbell, 1997; Sol´e and Alonso, 1998) and Hubbell’s recent book provides an extensive,
unifying account of these (Hubbell, 2001). The starting point of neutral models is a ran-
dom community that evolves towards an equilibrium state under a stochastic birth-and
death process incorporating dispersal. At high immigration rates, Hubbell’s theory pre-
dicts a logseries distribution for the abundance of species in the local community, while
when the immigration coupling between the metacommunity and the local community is
lower, a lognormal-like shape is obtained for this distribution. Within Hubbell’s approx-
imation, these distributions are shown to be particular cases of what he denotes as the
zero-sum multinomial (Hubbell, 2001).

Hubbell’s model for local communities is similar to that proposed in Sol´e et al., (2000)
and analysed in McKane et al, 2000. There we took advantage of a mean ﬁeld argument
to ﬁnd an analytical form for the stationary distribution for the probability of ﬁnding
species having an abundance of n individuals. In addition, we studied in detail its time
behaviour using diﬀerent approximations. Furthermore, our simpliﬁed approach based
on this mean ﬁeld argument allowed us to recover the scaling relationship between the

2

fraction of links actualised and the number of species in a community — the so-called
C ∗-S relation, and gave conditions in which such a relation arose.

Within Hubbell’s mathematical framework the dynamical stochastic models were nu-
merically solved and the equilibrium properties analysed.
In this paper we present an
analytic, general solution of Hubbell’s model for the local community dynamics, that
provides the stationary species-abundance distributions together with the time evolution
from the initial state towards the stationary distribution.

2 Formulation of the theory

Hubbell’s theory concerns populations on two scales:
local communities and regional
metacommunities. To explain the model and derive the equations in the simplest possible
way, we will use the language of urn models (Feller, 1968; Johnson and Kotz, 1977). This
is a natural description when the stochastic dynamics in one time step only depends on the
state of the system at the beginning of the time step (in other words is a Markov process).
It also provides us with a concrete picture of the process which aids the derivation of the
governing equation for the model.

We begin by considering the model in a limit where the two levels of description are
uncoupled. This allows us to focus only on the local community. We assume that there
are Ni individuals of species i in the local community, with the total number of individuals
r
of all species being J, that is, J =
i=1 Ni where r is the total number of species. The
model is deﬁned by picking one individual at random from the local community, killing
it, and then replacing it by an individual also drawn from the local community. In terms
of the associated model this corresponds to having Ni balls of colour i (i = 1, . . . , r) in
the urn. If we focus on one particular colour, j, the probability that the number of balls
will decrease from Nj to Nj −

1 during one time step is

since a ball of colour j must be discarded and one of any other colour replaced for such
a transition to occur. On the other hand, the probability that the number of balls will
increase from Nj to Nj +1 requires that a ball of any other colour but j must be discarded,
and one of colour j be replaced. Therefore

The whole point of the model, however, is to couple local communities and regional

metacommunities. This is achieved by choosing a replacement ball from the urn only (1
−
m) of the time. For the rest of the time it is chosen from outside the urn. The probability
of picking a ball of colour j from this external source is deﬁned to be Pj, and corresponds
to assuming that the replacement individual comes from the regional metacommunity
where species i has a relative abundance of Pi. The transition probabilities (1) and (2)
now read

Compared with the long time scales we are interested in — during which many transi-
tions will take place — the step size is very small, and we may take the limit in which
∆P (Nj, t)
dP (Nj, t)/dt. The resulting equation is a master equation for the probabil-
ity P (Nj, t) (Van Kampen, 1981; Gardiner, 1985). Some care is needed with the boundary
conditions on this equation: clearly the cases Nj = 0 and Nj = J are special cases since
there can be no transitions which reduce Nj in the former case or which increase Nj in
the latter case. One possibility is to write two separate equations for these special cases.
However there is no need for this if we ﬁrst observe that some of these conditions are nat-
ural consequences of the form of the transition probabilities. For example, the expressions
in (3) and (4) are both zero if Nj = 0 and Nj = J respectively. So as long as we agree
to impose the formal deﬁnitions W (0
J + 1) = 0 the same master
equation may be used for all states. In addition, an initial condition needs to be imposed
to complete the speciﬁcation of the problem. Typically, the number of individuals in the
local community at t = 0 will be given: P (Nj, 0) = δNj ,Nj,0.

The mathematical formulation of Hubbell’s theory described above can be directly
mapped on to another dynamical model of a multispecies community which we introduced
a few years ago (Sol´e et al., 2000; McKane et al., 2000; Sol´e et al., 2002). In this case
though, the nature of the interaction depends on the “score” between one species and
another, and a form of mean ﬁeld theory had to be used in order to describe the dynamics
by such a straightforward dynamics. In terms of the notation we have used above — N
denoting the number of individuals of a particular species and J denoting the total number
of individuals of all species — the transition probabilities of this model are (Sol´e et al.,
2000; McKane et al., 2000):

Here µ is the fraction of the time that replacing of one species by another can happen

number of species, and C ∗, a parameter related to the degree of connectivity of the matrix
of scores between the species. The precise form of the mapping is C ∗ = 1 and Pj = S−1.
Since we have analysed this model extensively (McKane et al., 2000) we may simply
deduce expressions for quantities of interest in the Hubbell theory by setting C ∗ = 1, S =

The stationary probability distribution, Ps(Nj), is determined by setting dP (Nj)/dt = 0.
This gives

rNj +1 Ps(Nj + 1)

gNj Ps(Nj) = rNj Ps(Nj)

(11)

This is true for all Nj, which implies that rNj Ps(Nj)

gNj−1 Ps(Nj −

rNj +1 Ps(Nj + 1) = gNj Ps(Nj) ; Nj = 0, 1, ..., J .

(12)

To solve this equation, let us ﬁrst assume that m
and (9) are all non-zero and we can solve (12) by iteration to obtain

= 0. Then the rNj and gNj given by (8)

Ps(Nj) =

Ps(Nj) = Ps(0) +

Ps(Nj) = 1 .

(14)

To simplify the algebra let us introduce some new notation for various combinations of
parameters which naturally appear in the solution of the model. We write the transition
probabilities as

Substituting the expressions (15) and (16) into (13) gives an explicit representation for the
Ps(Nj) in terms of Ps(0). An expression for Ps(0) itself can be obtained by performing the
ﬁnite sum which appears in (14). This sum can be performed analytically using properties
of Jacobi polynomials (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1965). Alternatively, the mapping into
the model deﬁned by (6) and (7) can be used since the result for the Ps is known in this
case (Sol´e et al., 2000; McKane et al., 2000). One ﬁnds (see McKane et al., 2000, for
details of the derivation):

where β(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b) is the beta-function.

It is interesting to note that in the case m = 0, where the local community is decoupled
from the regional metacommunity, g0 = 0, and so from (12), since r1
= 0, it follows that
= 0 for 0 < Nj < J, we see from (12) that Ps(Nj) = 0 for all
Ps(1) = 0. In fact, since rNj 6
0 < Nj < J. So with no interaction with the regional metacommunity, species j either
disappears or becomes the only species there is in the local community. Therefore some
degree of coupling is vital for biodiversity.

In Fig 1, we have computed the stationary distribution for diﬀerent parameter values
and sizes of the system. The relative species abundance distribution predicted to occur
in local communities — the zero-sum multinomial— by the uniﬁed theory of Hubbell can
be readily computed even for high community sizes using the analytic formula (18).

4 Time dependence

Together with universal features displayed by the stationary patterns observed in mature
communities, some common features are also observed when looking at how diversity de-
velops in time. When an empty ﬁeld starts to be colonized by immigrant species a new
community gets formed and a pattern of species replacement develops. The transition
from abandoned ﬁeld to mature forest is one of the best known examples of ecological
sucession and is common in many places after the abandonment of agricultural land. In
temperate climates, a mature forest is the end point of sucession, in spite of the difer-
ent potential initial conditions. The path towards the steady species-ranks distribution
seems to be common to many diﬀerent ecosystems (Hubbell, 2001). Furthermore, natural
systems are continuously perturbed; any disturbance resumes the process of ecological
succession. It is thus natural to ask: what predictions about this process can be made in
the context of Hubbell’s neutral theory?

In the last section it was shown that a closed form expression could be obtained for
the probability of ﬁnding Nj individuals of species j in the local community when the
systems has reached the stationary state. In addition to this, just mentioned, we also
wish to know how the community is assembled from a given starting point. This requires
us to solve for the time-dependence of the model. It is not possible, in general, to carry
this out exactly, since the transition probabilities (15) and (16) are nonlinear functions of
Nj. It is nevertheless possible to get a very good approximation to P (Nj, t) by using the
fact that in cases of interest J will be large. The approach which we will use, due to Van
Kampen (1981), is rather technical and has been discussed elsewhere in some detail (Van
Kampen, 1981; McKane et al., 2000), but the basic idea is quite simple. Therefore, we
will avoid these complications, and quote relevant results using the correspondence with
the transition probabilities (6) and (7).

The key idea is to expand about the deterministic version of the theory. In the limit
where the number of individuals becomes inﬁnite, all stochasticity is lost, and the system is
completely described by a deterministic equation. This equation is not known a priori, but
if it can be established, an expansion in powers of J −1 could perhaps be set up to calculate
corrections to the deterministic result which would be valid for large, but ﬁnite, J. Quite
generally we would expect a plot of P (Nj, t) against Nj for ﬁxed t to be approximately
Gaussian for large J. The motion of the peak of this distribution would move with
t according to the deterministic equation. Van Kampen’s large J expansion gives the
deterministic equation as the zeroth order (J
) result, with the next to leading order
result giving a Gaussian distribution peaked at this value. Higher order contributions give
corrections to this distribution, but they are usually so small for large J that they are of
very little interest. Since a Gaussian centred on a given value is completely determined

by its width, there are only two things to ﬁnd: (i) the deterministic equation, (ii) the
width of the distribution.

In practice one writes Nj = Jφj(t) + J 1/2xj, where φj(t) = limJ→∞(Nj/J) is the
fraction of j species which are present in the local community at time t in the deterministic
limit. The variable

(Nj −
characterises the ﬂuctuations away from the deterministic theory. We require φj(t) and
x2
= 0). Using the correspondence between the two models we obtain (McKane

where τ = t/J is a rescaled time. This equation is easily understood: if φj is less than the
abundance of species j in the regional metacommunity, then it increases. If it is more,
then it decreases. The equation is easily solved to give

to the t variable gives

In Hubbell (2001, Chapter 4), an alternative discrete-time formulation of this local
community model is given. Obviously, both time discrete and time continuous formula-
tions give rise to the same equations for the deterministic model counterpart (Hubbell,
2001, page 110). However, he does not address the stochastic time-continuous formula-
tion. Here we show that insight can be gained by ﬁnding approximate solutions to the
time-dependent model.

In Fig. 2, we show the temporal evolution for P (Nj, t) computed both using a Gaussian
approximation (Eq. (23)) and the numerical integration of the master equation. The good
agreement which is obtained is a reﬂection of the fact that community sizes J are taken
to be large enough so that further terms in the large J-expansion are negligible. However,
if the ﬁnal stationary distribution does not have a Gaussian shape, more terms should
be included in the expansion so as to capture the true temporal behaviour of P (Nj, t).
Notice that, while the approximation given by Eq. (23) is always represented as dotted
or punctuated curves, in some cases these are not visible because they match the exact
distribution so completely.

5 Conclusion

The main aim of this paper has been to show that aspects of Hubbell’s neutral model
of local community biodiversity dynamics can be solved for exactly, and even if this is
not possible, calculational schemes are available which provide very good approximations
to the solution. Speciﬁcally, we have shown that the stationary properties of the model,
which can be obtained from the zero-sum multinomial, can all be found exactly. So, for
instance, the mean value and variance of the number of individuals of species j, can be
obtained from this probability distribution. The nature of the time evolution cannot be
determined in closed form, but a controlled approximation based on assuming that the
total number of individuals of all species, J, is large, is possible. This is an excellent
approximation in most cases of interest, and we would expect that the results that we
have obtained will be relevant in these situations. The applicability of our approximation
scheme was checked by carrying out the numerical integration of the master equation (Eq.
10). The results, displayed in Fig. 2, conﬁrm our expectations.

While the results which we have reported describe the essential aspects of the solution
of Hubbell’s model, there are many other interesting features which are also amenable
to analysis and for which deﬁnite, and well-controlled, results may be obtained. The
structure of the metacommunity and the form of the colonisation curve are examples.
These, and related questions, are presently under study, and we hope to report our results
in a future publication.

exact master equation. In both cases, the initial number of individuals of the focus
J. The relative abundance of the focus species in the metacom-
species was 0.8
munity was Pj = 0.1 also in both cases. We have dropped the subscript j, which
labels a particular species, in the ﬁgure.

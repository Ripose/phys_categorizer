ABSTRACT

We discuss the problem of observation of natural similarity in skeletal evolution of terres-

trial mammals. Analysis is given by means of testing of the power scaling laws established

in long bone allometry, which describe development of bones (of length L and diameter

D) with body mass in terms of the growth exponents, e.g. λ = d log L/d log D . The

bone-size evolution scenario given three decades ago by McMahon was quiet explicit on the

geometrical-shape and mechanical-force constraints that predicted λ = 2/3. This remains

too far from the mammalian allometric exponent λ(exp) = 0.80 ± 0.2, recently revised by

Christiansen, that is a chief puzzle in long bone allometry. We give therefore new insights

into McMagon’s constraints and report on the ﬁrst observation of the critical-elastic-force,

bending-deformation, muscle-induced mechanism found with λ = 0.80±0.3. This mechanism

governs the bone-size evolution with avoiding skeletal fracture caused by muscle-induced

peak stresses and is expected to be a unique for small and large mammals.

Observation of Mammalian Similarity through Allometric Scaling Laws

by V.B. Kokshenev

I. INTRODUCTION

In general, biological laws do not follow from physical laws in a simple and direct way.

Examples include Kleiber’s allometric law known as the 3/4 power law that scales metabolic

rates for animals and plants to their mass. As shown by West et al. in Refs. [1,2] the ob-

served metabolic rate scaling law arises from the interplay between geometric and physical

constraints implicit in the energy source distributions (see also discussion in Ref. [3]). An-

other famous 2/3 power law for scaling of longitudinal-to-transverse dimensions of animals

and plants was proposed by McMahon [4] through physical description of geometric-shape

and critical-force similarities noticed in size evolution of animals and plants. Given in explicit

form in Ref. [4], the geometrical-(cylindrical-volume)-shape and mechanical-(critical-elastic-

buckling)-force constraints imposed on size evolution for animals and plants with their mass

yielded the aforementioned 2/3 power scaling law, along with the 1/4 and 3/8 laws de-

duced [4], respectively, for longitudinal and transverse linear dimensions. During almost

three decades McMahon’s scaling laws have been a controversial subject of intensive study

and debate. As the matter of fact, McMahon’s description of the geometrical-shape and

mechanical-force similarities was experimentally proved for terrestrial mammals neither in

body allometry [5] nor in long bone allometry [6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. Moreover, the most

recent condemnation by Christiansen [14] states that no satisfactory explanation for any

power-law scaling observed in mammalian allometry can be expected.

We will demonstrate that the essence of the problem of failure of McMahon’s constraints

is due to the fact that the skeletal subsystem of animals is not mechanically isolated from

their muscle subsystem, as was suggested in Ref. [4]. Also, McMahon’s hypothesis that the

skeletal support of weight and fast locomotion of mammals is driven solely by a gravitation

2

ﬁeld contradicts to up-to-date comprehension on a role of muscle ﬁbers and tendons in

formation of maximum skeletal stresses. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we

revisit McMahon’s evolution constraint equations within context of their application to long

bone allometry for terrestrial mammals.

In view of the known experimental ﬁndings in

muscle ﬁber allometry, these equations are modiﬁed and generalized . Experimental testing

of the two distinct critical-elastic-force mechanisms that govern evolution of mammalian

bones is elaborated in Sec. III. Discussion and conclusions are given in Sec. IV.

II. MCMAGON’S CONSTRAINTS IN LONG BONE ALLOMETRY

A. Elastic Similarity Model Revisited

Famous power laws by McMahon [4] for scaling of linear dimensions of animals and

plants was proposed within the framework of the so-called elastic similarity model (hereafter,

ESM). Application of the ESM by McMahon to the case of mammalian bone allometry

was based on the cylindric-shape correspondence that takes place between a given skeletal

bone and a cylindrical beam. A bone sample was therefore geometrically approximated

by a cylinder of diameter Dis and length Lis, where index i counts diﬀerent bones and s

indicates mammalian specie. The mechanical-force correspondence to the same rigid cylinder

is justiﬁed by observation of the universal (specie-independent) bone-stress safety factors.

These are given by ratio of yield stress to peak stress and are about 3. Exploration of such

a kind of the mechanical correspondence by McMahon gave rise to the maximum-(elastic-

buckling)-force constraint imposed on volume-size evolution of a given bone.

More speciﬁcally, the ESM is based on the fact that the mechanical failure of a bone

is prevented through its linear dimensions Dis and Lis, adjusted to bear critical buckling
elast = F (crit)
buckl .

deformations, related to peak stresses through the maximum elastic forces: F (max)

The latter is due the elastic instability given in terms of the critical bending deformations and

is described by the Euler critical estimate F (crit)

buckl = π2EI/L2 for a given cylinder (of length

3

L and of diameter D, with the moment of inertia I = πD4/64 and the elastic modulus E,

see e.g. Cap. IV in Ref. [16]). Thus the ESM constraint equations attributed by McMahon

to the cylindric-shape and elastic-force similar skeletal bones, can be introduced through (a)

the elastic-buckling critical force F (crit)

and (b) the cylindric-bone volume V (bone)

, namely

(3)

In long-bone allometry, the observation of evolution of limb bones across mammalian

species is discussed though the bone-size, linear-dimension scaling to body mass Ms. This

is given in terms of the bone-diameter and the bone-length allometric exponents di and li,

or of the i-bone growth dimension exponents, introduced by the following scaling diﬀerential

relations, namely

di =

λi =

d log Dis
d log Ms
d log Lis
d log Dis

, li =

≡ li
di

.

d log Lis
d log Ms

, and

The reduced dimension exponent λi, related to the longitudinal-to-transverse scaling, is also

deﬁned. As seen, Eqs.(2), (3) are equivalent to the corresponding diﬀerential equations

dDis/dMs = diDis/Ms , etc., which solutions are commonly derived in bone allometry

through regression equations Dis = cisM di, where M is treated as an external mammalian

parameter and cis are constants. A notable feature of the introduced scaling relations is

independence of the i-bone exponents on mammalian specie s. This is corroborated in bone

allometry observations and Eqs. (2), (3) are therefore commonly treated as the allometric

scaling laws. This implies a universal fashion in evolution of any linear dimension of bones,

as well as bone volume Vis = D2

isLis, with body mass that in a certain way reﬂects similarity

of mammals with their size evolution. With taking into account that ρVis = Mis (ρ is bone

density), and adopting additionally McMahon’s hypotheses (a) that an eﬀective skeletal

evolution is constrained by gravitation, i.e., F (crit)

∼ gMis (g is the gravity constant), and

is

4

(b) that bone mass Mis linearly scales to body mass Ms, the following i-bone-evolution

equations, namely

4di − 2li = 1,

2di + li = 1





(4)

result from, respectively, Eqs.(1a) and (1b) with the help of the scaling relations given in

Eq.(2). In turn, Eqs.(4) and (3) provide the well known ESM predictions: d(buckl)

= 3/8,

0

l(buckl)
0

= 1/4, and λ(buckl)

0

= 2/3, including the trivial isometric solution d0 = l0 = 1/3 and

λ0 = 1. As mentioned in the Introduction, these predictions were not proved experimentally

even when a statistical dispersion of allometric data was taken into account (for recent

criticism of the ESM predictions for the exponents d, l and λ see analyses given in Table 5

in Refs. [13] and Table 3 in Ref. [14], respectively).

B. Elastic-Buckling-Force Criterium

Skeletal evolution of animals cannot be studied independently of their muscle ﬁbers and

tendons. Moreover, the peak skeletal stresses are generated rather by muscle contractions

than by gravitation. These both statements follow from studies of muscle design and bone

strains during locomotion [17,18,20,21]. We infer therefore that the maximum elastic forces

exerted by long bones are originated from the maximum muscle forces, i.e., F (max)

elast = F (max)
musc .

The same studies provide strong evidence that the maximum muscle stresses are independent

of body mass, and thus F (max)

musc /A(max)
musc

∝ M 0, where A(max)
musc

is the maximum cross-section

area of muscle ﬁbers. The critical-force constraint, justiﬁed through the safety factors,

can be therefore formally introduced into consideration by the ”overall-bone” critical-force

exponent ac, namely

ac =

d log F (crit)
musc
d log Ms

= acm =

d log A(max)
musc
d log M

(5)

and the critical muscle-area exponent acm. These should be distinguished from the corre-

sponding exponents

5

aci =

d log F (crit)
d log Ms

is

and am =

d log Amusc
d log M

(6)

where F (crit)

is

is given in Eq.(1a). The muscle-area exponent am is known in muscle allometry

[9,20,22,19] as the muscle-ﬁber, cross-section-area exponent and can be exempliﬁed by data

m = 0.69 − 0.91 derived by Pollock and Shadwick for four distinct groups of muscles
a(exp)

in mammalian hindlimbs (see Fig.3 in Ref. [22]). Commonly, the maximum muscle force is

associated [9] with the leg group of muscles of animals, i.e., A(max)

of the latter in Eq.(5), the ”leg-muscle” critical exponent a(exp)

musc = A(leg)

musc. With adopting
cm = 0.81 − 0.83 was obtained

[22] (on the bases of data [9] for six groups of mammalian leg muscles by Alexander et al.)

and reported by Pollock and Shadwick in Ref. [22].

In order to establish the critical muscle-area exponent a(exp)

cm introduced in Eq.(5), we

have reanalyzed the experimental data found in Ref. [22] on muscle ﬁber area Amusc in

mammalian hindlimbs as a function of body mass. In Fig.1 we seek therefore the maximum

areas A(max)

musc that are provided by the highest points Amusc found for a given mass. As seen

from Fig.1, A(max)

musc are due to diﬀerent groups of leg muscles, which change with evolution

of (35 quadrupedal) animals from small to large species. No doubts that the muscle group

common digital extensors (shown by crosses and adjusted [22] with a(C)

m = 0.69) has the

smallest areas, shows almost isotropic evolution, and does not therefore plays any important

role in formation of maximum muscle stresses. Qualitatively the same can be referred to

plantaris (shown by circles) with [22] a(P )

estimate for the critical muscle-area exponent acm can be given by a(exp)

cm

m = 0.91. If one excludes these groups, a rough
≈ 0.77 − 0.85.

This follows from the analysis given in Ref. [22] and adjusted for the principal muscles

(deﬁned here through the groups of gastsrocnemius with a(G)

m = 0.77 and deep digital ﬂexors

with a(D)

m = 0.85 ), which are eventually responsible for maximum hindlimbs bone stresses.

More accurate data on maximum area A(max)
musc

is found by ﬁtting the experimental points

asymptotically from above that is shown by the solid line in Fig.1. Regression elaborated

within the experimental error (approximated from above by a set of nearest points measured

for the same mass) provides a(exp)

cm = 0.82 ± 0.01 (with the correlation coeﬃcient r = 0.997).

6

Remarkably, that this ﬁnding matches well the aforegiven data for the ”leg-muscle” exponent

by Alexander et al. reported in Ref. [22] and can be therefore considered as the reliable data.

Eqs.(5) and (6) yield the following deﬁnition for the ”overall-bone” averaged exponents,

namely

ac =< aci >≡ 1
n

n

X
i=1

aci = acm,

where summation is limited by bones which do play a principal role in support and fast

locomotion of body mass of animals. Eq.(7) can be also treated as an extension of the

similar deﬁnition of the mammalian principal-bone-averaged exponents d, l and λ introduced

with the help of Eqs.(2),(3), e.g., d =< di >. Thereby, the modiﬁcation of McMahon’s a-

hypothesis provides a new a-constraint equation imposed on the exponents: 4d − 2l = ac.

In view of the fact that neither skeletal mass [11] nor bone mass [15] are linear with

mammalian body mass, McMahon’s revised b-constraint equation given in Eq.(4) for i-bone

should be substituted by 2di + li = bi, where the i-bone-mass exponent bi is introduced

through the relevant scaling, namely

Thus, McMahon’s critical-force and cylindric-shape constraints given in Eq.(4) result in the

following modiﬁcations of the ESM, namely

bi =

d log Mis
d log Ms

.

4d − 2l = ac,

.

2d + l = b




In turn, this provides new predictions for the mammalian overall-bone dimension and

reduced-dimension exponents, or the elastic-buckling-criterium predictions, namely

d(buckl) =

ac + 2b
8
λ(buckl) = 8 <

, l(buckl) =

2b − ac
4

and

bi
aci + 2bi

> −2 .

The latter prediction follows from the deﬁnition for the reduced-dimension exponent λi =

li/di given in Eq.(3) and presented here in the form λi = bi/di − 2, with the help of the

b-constraint equation.

C. Elastic-Bending-Force Criterium

After Alexander et al. [23] it has been widely recognized (for recent references see in Ref.

[15]) that the elastic bending deformations play a crucial role in the overall peak stresses of

long bones instead of a simple axial compression discussed [4] in terms of buckling defor-

mations by McMahon. The corresponding critical force F (max)

elas = F (crit)

bend applied normally to

the bone before fracture was discussed in long-bone allometry in Refs. [11,20]. In view of

the common elastic nature of both kind of deformations, the force F (crit)

in a certain way

extends the ESM given in Eq.(1) to the case of the bending critical deformations, namely

Straightforward application of the scaling diﬀerential relations given in Eqs. (2),(3), with

accounting of the critical-force and the bone-mass growth exponents given in, respectively,

Eqs.(5), (8) and (9), results in the following new constraint equations, namely

This provides the elastic-bending criterium expressed in terms of the following predictions

for the mammalian bone-dimension growth exponents, namely

d(bend) =

λ(bend) = 5 <

and

Notably that both the elastic-force criteria given in Eqs. (10) and (14) are consistent with

the isometric solution (d0 = l0 = 1/3 and λ0 = 1), which exists under conditions that the

mammalian muscle-area subsystem develops isometrically (a0 = 2/3) and independently of

the skeletal subsystem (b0 = 1). As a matter of fact, this simpliﬁed geometric scenario is

violated by the nature through the bone-dimension allometric scaling laws given by d(exp) >

0.33, l(exp) < 0.33, and λ(exp) < 1.

III. OBSERVATION OF BONE EVOLUTION SIMILARITIES THROUGH

EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF CONSTRAINT EQUATIONS

All predictions given by the original [4], modiﬁed and extended ESM are analyzed in the

bone growth diagram in Fig.2. As seen, the available experimental data matches neither the

isometric nor the original ESM solutions (shown by crosses), even in case when dispersion

eﬀects of the experimental data (shown by error bars) are taken into account. Note that this

large dispersion is not caused by error measurements of bone dimensions or body mass of an-

imals, but is result from a large phylogenetic spectrum of terrestrial mammals∗. Unlike the

case of the pioneer data [8] by Alexander et al., all species which have multiple specimens,

were additionally averaged [14] within a certain mammalian subfamily before to be docu-

mented. The most accurate allometric data with the systematically reduced phylogenetic

statistical error were given [13,14,15] by Christiansen.

The predictions of the modiﬁed and the extended ESM are shown in Fig. 2 by the

shaded areas, which correspond to, respectively, Eqs.(9) and (13) estimated with account

of the reliable domain for the critical-force exponent a(exp)

= 0.81 − 0.83 and of that for

c

the bone-mass exponent b(exp) = 1.0 − 1.1, which approximately covers dispersion of the

experimental data on b(exp)

i

( see Table 2 in Ref. [15]). The shaded areas correspond the

critical-force constraints given by the a-constraint lines 4d − 2l = 0.82 and 3d − l = 0.82

extended by cylindric-volume constraints implicit in the form of the elastic-buckling-force

and the elastic-bending-force criteria, respectively. As seen from Fig. 2, the elastic-buckling

criterium seems to be observable within the range of the unreduced phylogenetic statistical

error. After reduction of this error, only the elastic-bending criterium corroborates.

Besides the case of the 6-long-bone-averaged allometric data [13] given in Fig.2 for the

∗In fact, there exist some errors due to deviation of bone shape from the ideal cylinder. Also, not

all body mass were really measured but taken as an average from the literature data (see discussion

in Ref. [14]).

one-scale least-square regression (LSR), we have also elaborated analysis of the double set

of the allometric exponents (taken from Table 5 in Ref. [13]) derived within the two-scale

regressions made for small (M < 50kg) and large (M > 50kg) mammals. But no deﬁnitive

conclusions on domination of any elastic-force criteria is inferred. Indeed, in the case of the

overall-(6-bone)-averaged data fro small and large animals is far to be ﬁtted by the dashed

areas in Fig.2. When the ulna and the ﬁbula are excluded, the principal-(4-bone)-averaged

LSR data corroborates the elastic-bending criterium and the elastic-buckling criterium, re-

spectively, for small and large mammals. However, unlike the case of the one-scale data,

experimental accuracy of the two-scale analysis is marginal that makes doubtful the infer-

ence on observation of both the distinct critical-force constraints. In what follows we restrict

our analysis by the one-scale allometric data for the four principal mammalian long bones

listed in Table 1.

First, we check a selfconsistency of data on the dimension ( l(exp)

, d(exp)
i

i

) [13] and reduced-

dimension (λ(exp)

i

) [14] allometric exponents obtained independently and presented in ﬁrst

and second columns of Table 1, respectively. As seen, the bone-averaged data, when are

compared between the two regression methods, obey the relation d(exp)/l(exp) = λ(exp) with

accuracy that is much higher for case partial i-bone relations d(exp)

/l(exp)

within the scope of the same method. Then, the geometrical mammalian similarity is tested

on the basis of the b-constraint equation 2d(exp)

+ l(exp)

= b(exp)
i

i

in second and third columns

of Table 1. Again, the cylindric-shape similarity, given in terms of the bone-averaged data, is

conﬁrmed† with a small error. We deduce that the observation of the mammalian similarity

through the allometric power laws can be realized only ”on the average”, but not for a given

type of ”mammalian” bone as it commonly adopted in allometric studies. Examples are

testing of the original ESM predictions (and the constraint equation 3d − l = a) in Table 5

†Exclusion should be given for the case of the exponent b∗ , which data obtained by the square

regression (LSR) method is not available.

in Ref. [13], Table 3 in Ref. [14] (and Table 3.11 in Ref. [19]) that is made for data a given

i-bone, but not for the overall-bone data.

The validation of the bone-evolution a-constraint equation for the case of the bending

loads, i.e., 3d−l = a, where a is treated as a free parameter, was ﬁrst discussed [20] by Selker

and Carter in terms of the bone strength index. On the basis of the mammalian data [10] by

Biewener (shown in Fig. 2) and their own data for artiodactyls, the overall-bone-averaged

equation 3d(exp) − l(exp) = a provided [20] estimates a = 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. In view

of the closeness of these bone-dimension allometric prediction to the known [20] muscle-area

allometric exponent a(exp)

m = 0.77 − 0.82 it was claimed [20] that the bending or torsion

deformations in mammalian long bones are due to muscle contractions. The same analysis

given on the basis of other available in the biological literature allometric data, including the

particular case of birds‡, has been recently made [19] by Garcia. As the result, a prediction

for the allometric muscle-area exponent am = 0.80 (which corresponds to the mean value

of the aforementioned mammalian data a(exp)

and that for birds) was suggested [19] as the

m

credible data for experimental testing of the bending-force-constraint equation.

As follows from the pioneer work [4] by McMahon, and elucidated in the previous sec-

tion, the force-constraint equation is driven by critical force, and is therefore given as

3d − l = ac where the critical-force exponent, according to Eq.(7), is established by the

data on maximum-muscle-area allometry, i.e., ac = a(exp)

cm = 0.82 ± 0.01. We have therefore

reconsidered analysis given in Table 3.11 in Ref. [19] and found [24] that no conclusions

can be made on validation§ on the principal-bone averaged equation 3d(exp) − l(exp) = a(exp)

cm

on the bases of the two-scale, RMA and LSR data [13]. Conversely, the critical-bending-

force constraint equation 3d − l = ac is strongly supported by the one-scale data [13] by

Christiansen deduced through both the diﬀerent (LSR and RMA) regressions. This follows

‡Application of the ESM for birds remains questionable.

§Again, the marginal estimate acm = 0.829 has obtained in the case of the small-animal LSR data.

11

from the bone-dimension predictions ac = 0.82 and 0.83 (obtained, respectively, for both

the methods with the help of data given in ﬁrst column in Table 1).

In the current study we put emphasis on observation of the mammalian similarity through

the critical muscle allometry exponent a(exp)

cm derived in Fig.1. and on the basis of one-scale

long-bone allometric data on the reduced-dimension exponent λ(exp)

obtained in Ref. [14].

The relevant reformulation of the elastic-buckling and the elastic-bending criteria given in

cm = 0.81 − 0.83. In contrast, the elastic-force bone-bending-deformation mechanism pre-

dicted by a(bend)

c

= 0.81 (and 0.83) within the LSR (and RMA regression) methods is proved

by selfconsistent reduced-dimension and linear-dimension long-bone allometry data reported

by Christiansen in Refs. [14] and Ref. [13], respectively. Again, analysis given similar to that

in Table 1, for the case of the two-scale principal-bone data reported in Refs. [13,14], corrob-

orates the same mechanism of evolution only for small mammals observed within the LSR

method, but remains this question open in the case of small mammals tested by the RMA

regression, and for all large mammals treated by both the methods.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have discussed the problem of observation of natural similarity in evolution of terres-

trial mammals through the scaling laws established in skeletal allometry. Veriﬁcation of the

two conceivable evolution mechanisms that drive the bone size development with body mass

of animals is given on the basis of experimental data on the reduced dimension (λi = li/ di),

longitudinal dimension (li), and transverse dimension (di) allometric exponents, commonly

discussed in the mammalian long-bone allometry.

Since Galilei it was repeatedly recognized that the isometric skeletal evolution prescribed

by the overall-bone exponent λ0 = 1 is not observed in the nature because the small mam-

mals are not geometrically overbuilt and the large species do not operate very close to their

mechanical failure limit that it would be expected from the isometric scenario. This ﬁg-

urative, widely cited description given by Biewener [7] is in agreement with the simpliﬁed

version (with λ0 = 1) of the more sophisticated scenario proposed by McMahon. Within the

ESM, the mammalian similarity was introduced [4] on the basis of realistic geometrical-shape

and mechanical-force correspondence that takes place between a given skeletal bone and a

rigid cylinder. As mentioned in the Introduction and illustrated in Fig.2, evolution of bone

dimensions with body mass given by the ESM was disapproved in long bone allometry. This

implies that the ESM prediction that λ(buckl)

0

= 0.667 is not so far experimentally justiﬁed

by the observed data on λ(exp), including the most systematic ﬁnding that for principal long

bones λ(exp) = 0.78 − 0.82 (that follows from Table 1 as the mean between the LSR and

RMA bone-averaged data).

A good deal eﬀort has been undertaking in long bone allometry to learn experimental

conditions for observation of critical-force (elastic-buckling-deformation and gravity-induced)

mechanism proposed by McMahon for explanation of the anatomical adaptation of skeletal

bones through their linear dimensions. The ﬁrst objection [5] by Economos was that the

by McMahon’s mechanical-failure mechanism should not be expected as a unique for all

species, but would more suitable for large mammals. This stimulated a careful search for

13

additional scaling laws for small and large mammals. These were established in terms of

the double sets of allometric exponents introduced [13,14,15] by Christiansen through the

two-scale regressions distinguished by the boundary mass Mc = 50kg adopted as common

for all species. Furthermore, it was speculated that the revealed inadequate description of

the scaling laws is due to inaccuracy of the methods of regression and, as a result, the RMA

regression was suggested [13] as well-chosen instead of the traditional LSR. The second

objection [5] by Economos refers to the linearity of the logarithmic scaling laws given in

Eq. (2), which was not expected to be sole across the three order of magnitudes of body

mass. Experimental veriﬁcation of this idea by Christiansen revealed [13] that application

of the polynomial type of regressions in bone allometry does not improve the correlations

established within the traditional linear logarithmic scaling. Finally, thorough numerical

analyses [13,14] of the reasons of the ESM failure brought Christiansen to a conclusion

that ”many factors contribute to maintaining skeletal stress at uniform level”, including the

factor of bending-deformation-induced stresses, which are more important [13] than stresses

illuminated [4] by McMahon.

We have demonstrated how the factors of muscle ﬁber contractions, bone mass evolution,

and of bending bone deformations can be incorporated into the ESM model. As a result, the

modiﬁed (by bone-mass and muscle-contraction factors) the ESM becomes observable (see

shaded area that extends a-buckling line in Fig.2) under condition that the unreduced sta-

tistical error of the allometric data [8,10,12] is taken into account. Otherwise, the extended

(additionally by bending-deformation factor) ESM is experimentally justiﬁed in Fig.2. An-

other analysis (given in Table 1) yields the observation of the mammalian similarity within

the principal-long-bone allometric data [13,14,15] by Christiansen, with systematically re-

duced phylogenetic statistical error. As demonstrated, this observation can be realized only

in terms of the bone-averaged allometric exponents, restricted by the principal bones that

are involved into the evolution-constraint equations. Example is the volume-constraint b-

equation, which should be valid for any conceivable bone-evolution mechanism. As follows

from analysis given in columns 2 and 3 in Table 1, b-equation is observed in the ”bone-

14

averaged” form 2d(exp) + l(exp) = b(exp), but not in the form 2d(exp)

+ l(exp)

for a given i-bone. We guess that the observation of the geometric-shape similarity through

experimental justiﬁcation of the exact Eq.(12b) should depend on neither the number of

scales nor the number of methods chosen for regression of the bone-dimension allometric

data. Our additional veriﬁcation of the cylindric-shape similarity given on the basis of the

two-scale principal-long-bone allometric data (taken from Table 3 in Ref. [13]) and derived

by the LSR and the RMA corroborates this statement for both small and large mammals.

We infer therefore that both the methods and both the scales are equivalent in observation

of the ”bone-averaged” geometric mammalian similarity, at least for the principal∗∗ bones.

A crucial role of the principal bones in primarily support the body mass was highlighted

by Christiansen. He noted [14] that greatly reduced ulna and too thin ﬁbula do not play of

much importance in support of body mass. They are therefore not suitable for testing of the

critical-force constraints and should be excluded from the principal bone set. As follows from

our analyses given in Fig.1, qualitatively the same should be referred to some muscle ﬁber

groups such as common digital extensors which are not responsible for peak bone stresses.

As seen from Fig. 9 in Ref. [14] and Fig.1, tibia and plantaris show a crossover behavior that

corresponds to the principle-set bones and to the principle muscle-ﬁber groups, respectively,

for small and large mammals. As the reliable critical principal-muscle-area exponent acm

(= ac), which enters the critical-force a-equations, we propose the data a(exp)

cm = 0.82 ± 0.01.

This is deduced in Fig.1. and should be distinguished from the muscle-area data a(exp)

m =

0.80 ± 0.03 that was groundlessly used, instead of a(exp)

cm , in establishing of experimental

validation [20,19] of the critical-bending-force constraint 3d(exp) − l(exp) = a(exp)

cm . As shown,

this equation, unlike the case of the critical-buckling-force constraint 4d(exp) − 2l(exp) = a(exp)

cm

related to the original ESM, is observable directly and indirectly through, respectively, the

∗∗Extended statistical analysis of both the constraint equations, with including all available bone

allometric data will be discussed elsewhere [24].

15

a-constraint equation and Eq.(16) (analyzed in the last column of Table 1). Again, we infer

that the observation of the bending-force criterium does not depend on the method chosen

within the one-scale regression.

This is not the case for the two-scale data on bone-dimension allometric exponents re-

ported [13] by Christiansen. Indeed, as follows from our many-sided analysis, the elastic-

bending criterium is deﬁnitely supported for the small and large mammals within the

(principal-bone-averaged) LSR data and RMA, respectively. With accounting of the ob-

servation of the same criterium though the one-scale (principal-bone-averaged) LSR data,

we see that correlations established by the traditional LSR method, unlike suggestion in

Ref. [13], show their self-consistency. But no certain conclusions can be inferred within the

observation windows for small and large mammals in the cases of, respectively, RMA regres-

sion and LSR. We guess that the revealed discrepancy of the two equal in rights regression

methods signals on failure of deﬁnition of the observation windows employed for the analysis

of the critical-force constraints. In other words, unlike the case of the cylindric-shape simi-

larity, these windows are not expected to be universal, and cannot be therefore introduced

by the unique boundary mass Mc.

Thereby we have demonstrated that the mammalian similarity, observable through ex-

perimental validation of the bone-evolution constraint equations, is described in terms of the

one-scale principal-bone-averaged characteristics, which show independence on the regres-

sion method. Within this context, the observed in nature long-bone mammalian evolution

can be described through longitudinal-to-transverse bone-dimension scaling law, with the

aforegiven ”method-averaged” exponent λ(exp) = 0.80 ± 0.02. Assuming a high enough accu-

racy for the i-bone experimental data on the exponents a(exp)

and b(exp)
i

ci

, both the discussed

evolution-constraint criteria are approximated in the following forms, namely

λ(buckl) = 2

and λ(bend) =

2b − acm
2b + acm

3b − 2acm
b + acm

(17)

that follows from Eqs.(11) and (15), respectively. With accounting of the ﬁnding that

cm = 0.81 − 0.83 and adopting for the bone-mass mammalian allometric exponent b(exp) =
a(exp)

16

1.03 − 1.06 (see column 3 in Table 1) one has the following estimates for the reduced-

dimension allometric exponents:

λ(buckl) = 0.87 ± 0.02 and λ(bend) = 0.80 ± 0.03 with λ(exp) = 0.80 ± 0.02

(18)

One can see that solely the elastic-bending criterium is validated. This implies corroboration

the bone evolution mechanism, which provides avoidance of mechanical failure of mammalian

bones caused by critical elastic bending deformations induced by maximum-area muscle

contractions in long bones achieved during peak stresses.

From the physical point of view, the fact that the bending (but not buckling) elastic

deformations are crucial for mechanical failure of long rigid bones is expected, under condi-

tion that the inequality Lis ≫ Dis (but not Lis ' Dis) is fulﬁlled for animals of arbitrary

mass. This fact was not corroborated in the one-scale long-bone allometry, and we therefore

report on ﬁrst observation of the bending-critical-force criterium, which is expected to be

universal for small and large mammals. Finally, after McMahon, we have demonstrated

how the scaling laws established in mammalian allometry arise from a natural similarity

of animals and how they can be quite explicit on the evolution constraints on the basis of

simple geometrical and clear physical conceptions.

Table 1. Testing of the mammalian long-bone similarity through the elastic-buckling

and elastic-bending criteria. Experimental data by Christiansen on the mammalian dimen-

sion allometric exponents for i-bone diameter di, length li, reduced dimension exponent λi,

and bone mass bi exponents obtained by the least square regression (LSR) and the reduced

major axis (RMA) regression methods are taken from Tables 2 in Refs. [13], [14] and [15],

respectively. The LSR data for b∗

i are estimated here with the help of relation b∗

i = ribi ,

where ri (correlation coeﬃcient) and bi are corresponding data obtained by RMA regres-

sion. Predictions for the critical muscle-area exponents are given with the help of Eq.(16).

Bone averaged magnitudes are found as the mean values of the corresponding mammalian

allometric exponents, e.g., d = Σi=1di/4.

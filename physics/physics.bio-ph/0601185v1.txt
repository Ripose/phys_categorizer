Abstract

Single-molecule experiments in which force is applied to DNA or RNA molecules have enabled
important discoveries of nucleic acid properties and nucleic acid-enzyme interactions. These
experiments rely on a model of the polymer force-extension behavior to calibrate the experi-
ments; typically the experiments use the worm-like chain (WLC) theory for double-stranded
DNA and RNA. This theory agrees well with experiments for long molecules. Recent single-
molecule experiments have used shorter molecules, with contour lengths in the range of 1-10
persistence lengths. Most WLC theory calculations to date have assumed inﬁnite molecule
lengths, and do not agree well with experiments on shorter chains. Key physical eﬀects that
become important when shorter molecules are used include (i ) boundary conditions which
constrain the allowed ﬂuctuations at the ends of the molecule and (ii ) rotational ﬂuctuations
of the bead to which the polymer is attached, which change the apparent extension of the
molecule. We describe the ﬁnite worm-like chain (FWLC) theory, which takes into account
these eﬀects. We show the FWLC predictions diverge from the classic WLC solution for
molecules with contour lengths a few times the persistence length. Thus the FWLC will al-
low more accurate experimental calibration for relatively short molecules, facilitating future
discoveries in single-molecule force microscopy.

Introduction

Single-molecule force microscopy, in which force is applied to DNA or RNA molecules one at
a time, has enabled important discoveries of the mechanical behavior of nucleic acid (NA)
molecules and NA-enzyme interactions (1, 2). These experiments are usually calibrated
and interpreted using the worm-like chain theory (WLC). The WLC predicts the average
end-to-end extension z of a semiﬂexible polymer, given the force F applied to the ends of
the chain and the values of two constant parameters. The ﬁrst parameter is the molecule’s
unstressed total contour length L, which is proportional to the number of base pairs in a
double-stranded nucleic acid polymer. The second parameter, the eﬀective bending stiﬀness
parameter or persistence length A, describes the molecule’s local elastic behavior. Hence we
expect the value of A to depend on the molecule type and the nature of the surrounding
solution, but not on the contour length. (Additional parameters enter when the stretching
force exceeds about 20 pN, or when the molecule is torsionally constrained.) The WLC has
been successfully applied to long molecules of DNA (3, 4) and RNA (5, 6) and it is now the
standard model used in calibrating and interpreting SM force microscopy (7).

Existing treatments of the WLC theory do not agree well with experiments when the con-
tour lengths of the NA molecules are short. In particular, experiments on dsDNA molecules
with L/A ∼ 1–10 yield ﬁt values of the persistence length which are physically unrealistic
(8, 9, 10). These apparent values diﬀer from the accepted value, A ≈ 50 nm, by factors of
2–5. However, the persistence length is a material parameter, independent of the contour
length. Therefore this apparent L-dependent persistence length amounts to a failure of the
WLC, or at least its usual mathematical treatment, which assumes that L ≫ A.
In ad-
dition, the classic WLC solution neglects some physical eﬀects present in the experiments,
including the bead(s) attached to the end(s) of the molecule and surface eﬀects.
In this
paper we extend the WLC to include boundary conditions at the ends of the polymer and
rotational ﬂuctuations of the bead(s) attached to the molecule, and present solutions valid
at ﬁnite L. Our “ﬁnite worm-like chain” (FWLC) solution gives more accurate predictions
than the classic WLC solution for polymers with contour lengths less than a few times the
persistence length. In related recent work, Kulic et al. have studied ﬁnite-length eﬀects in
the stretching of DNA with a kink(11); their results apply in the high-force limit. At the
other extreme, references (12) and (13) give numerical results for the “tethered particle”, or
zero-force, limit.

Need for extensions of the WLC

The interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are essential to cells. Processes such
as transcription and translation, splicing, DNA copying, genome maintenance and DNA
repair require NA-protein interactions. Premature aging, cancer, and even death can result
from defects in NA-protein interactions. (We use the abbreviation NA to refer to single- or

Elasticity of short DNA molecules

double-stranded DNA, RNA or DNA-RNA hybrid molecules). Single-molecule experiments
have given new insight into NA-protein interactions, yielding information that is diﬃcult
to determine by other methods (1). In single-molecule force microscopy, force is applied to
assess NA mechanical behavior or NA-protein interactions (14). Typically one end of an NA
molecule is chemically attached to a surface and the other end is attached to a bead (ﬁgure
1). Manipulation of the bead, usually by optical (15) or magnetic (16) means, stretches the
NA polymer. (In variants of this setup, the NA may be attached to beads at both ends, or an
NA-binding protein may be attached to a surface.) Changes in the NA molecule extension
and force can be measured or applied.

A theory of NA stretching behavior is required to calibrate single-molecule force exper-
iments. The average end-to-end extension z of a polymer depends on the applied force F .
Using an accurate model of the force-extension behavior means that once the calibration is
performed, knowledge of any two of the extension, force, and contour length determines the
other. Thus, changes in experimentally measured extension at ﬁxed force can be directly
related to changes in contour length, for example when a processive enzyme “reels in” NA
as it moves.

In the absence of an accurate model of NA force-extension behavior, single-molecule force
microscopy encounters several problems. First, experimentalists lack a check on whether the
trap calibration is correct. Second, without an accurate force-extension theory, the contour
length cannot be deduced from a measurement of the extension at ﬁxed force. Therefore
motion of motors which change the length of the polymer in time cannot be accurately
measured. Third, force-extension measurements are frequently used to assess the number
of polymers attached to a given bead. The attachment of polymers to the surface/bead
occurs stochastically and can give more tethering molecules than desired. Measurement
of the force-extension behavior is used to conﬁrm the correct number of tether molecules.
Fourth, experiments which study forced unfolding of secondary structure (8, 9, 17) require
force-extension calibration to determine the free energy of the folded molecule.

The worm-like chain theory (WLC) of NA elasticity has become the standard model for
calibrating experiments. The WLC assumes that the polymer is an inﬁnitely long, inexten-
sible, isotropic rod with bending rigidity. The usual WLC solution gives the relationship
between fractional extension z/L and force in the limit L → ∞ (2, 3, 7). However, phys-
ical eﬀects neglected in the usual treatment of the WLC are important for relatively short
molecules, such as those used in several experiments (8, 9, 10, 17, 18).

Experiments have ﬁt data to the usual solution to the WLC even for relatively short
chains, because no alternative treatment has been available (9, 10). The result is a ﬁt value
of the persistence length which depends on the contour length of the molecule, with ﬁt values
as low as 10 nm (9). For double-stranded DNA, the accepted value of the persistence length
is approximately 50 nm (depending on solution conditions (19, 20)). Experimental force-
extension data, when ﬁt to a theory that correctly incorporates ﬁnite-length eﬀects, should
recover the intrinsic value of A, independent of L.

Finite-length eﬀects can be incorporated into the WLC theory by considering boundary
conditions at the end of the chain (11, 21). The constraints imposed by the boundary
conditions alter the force-extension behavior. A second important physical eﬀect typically
neglected in the WLC theory is the rotational motion of the bead(s) attached to the molecule
(ﬁgure 3). Experiments measure the position of the center of the bead, and typically one
estimates the molecule extension by subtracting the bead radius. This estimate is correct
only when the polymer-bead attachment is in line with the direction of the force (θ = 0
in ﬁgure 3) and the bead undergoes no rotational ﬂuctuations. For long molecules (with
contour lengths of tens of µm), the fractional error introduced by subtracting the bead
radius (typically 50–500 nm) can be neglected. However, for polymers with L of few hundred
nanometers, the error caused by ignoring bead rotational ﬂuctuations can be signiﬁcant.

Several other physical eﬀects are present in experiments, but neglected in most treatments
of the WLC. These include (i) the exclusion interaction between the molecule and the surface
(which prevents the polymer from entering the solid surface), (ii) the exclusion interaction
between the bead and the surface, and (iii) the exclusion interaction between the molecule
and the bead. These interactions are most important for zero or very low applied force, and
have been addressed in recent work (12, 13, 22). Other interactions between the surface and
the chain or bead may occur, such as electrostatic or van der Waals eﬀects. In this paper,
we will neglect these physical eﬀects, which are important only for very low forces or very
long polymers. Our goal in this paper is to present a uniﬁed model which includes the eﬀects
most important for single-molecule force microscopy experiments on dsNA molecules with
L/A ∼ 1–10; for dsDNA this means contour lengths of 50–500 nm.

Theory

The WLC model assumes an inextensible polymer: the contour length L of the molecule (the
total length of the molecular backbone) cannot be changed by applied force. For double-
stranded DNA, the overstretching transition which occurs for applied force around 60 pN
is a dramatic change in the organization of the molecule; however, lower applied forces (up
to approximately 20 pN) respect the inextensibility constraint (23, 24). The polymer is
assumed to possess an isotropic bending rigidity, characterized by the persistence length,
A. The persistence length is the length scale over which thermal ﬂuctuations randomize the
chain orientation. (In principle, the rod also resists twist. However, in many experiments
the twist is unconstrained and can be ignored.) We note that when considering single ﬁnite-
length molecules, we are not working in any “thermodynamic limit”. Therefore, diﬀerent
ensembles are not guaranteed to be equivalent (25, 26, 27). In this paper we work in the
ensemble relevant to most experiments, where the applied force is ﬁxed and calculate the
extension.

The chain energy includes the bending energy (Hooke’s law in the chain curvature) and

To determine the extension for a given applied force requires averaging over diﬀerent
polymer conformations. This leads to a path integral formulation of the statistical-mechanics
problem in the tangent vector to the chain (28, 29). If the ends of the chain are held at ﬁxed

which connects the probability distribution for the tangent vector at point s, ψ(ˆt, s) to the
same probability distribution at point s′:

From this relation, one can derive a Schr¨odinger-like equation which describes the s evolution

Boundary conditions at ends of chain

For relatively short NA molecules, the boundary conditions at the ends of the chain must
be considered (11, 21). The boundary conditions are speciﬁed by two probability density
functions, ψ(ˆt, s = 0) and ψ(ˆt, s = L). These enter the full partition function via

Ztot =

Bead rotational ﬂuctuations

Rotational ﬂuctuations of the bead can be explicitly included in the theory. Here we describe
the extension due to a bead at one end of the chain, with the other end of the chain held at
ﬁxed orientation (ﬁgure 1a; the generalization to consider beads at both ends of the polymer
is straightforward). In this case, the theory predicts the extension to the center of the bead,
not just the molecule extension. We assume that the bead is spherical and the ﬂuctuations
in the polymer-bead attachment are azimuthally symmetric about the ˆz axis (ﬁgure 3).

The unit vector ˆn points from the center of the bead to the polymer-bead attachment.
Thus the bead’s contribution to the energy of a ﬂuctuation with a given ˆn is F Rˆn · ˆz, where
R is the bead radius. Note that the energy is minimized when ˆn = −ˆz, and for other bead
orientations the energy increases. This gives a restoring torque on the bead which increases
as F R increases. We write the rescaled energy including this term as

Methods

Here we describe the calculation of the force-extension relation, the main quantity of interest
in single-molecule experiments. We must ﬁrst calculate the tangent-vector probability dis-
tribution ψ(ˆt, s) for all s along the chain. The distribution satisﬁes equation (5) above. This

Elasticity of short DNA molecules

PDE can be solved using separation of variables in s and ˆt, where the angular dependence
is expanded in spherical harmonics (3).

Ψ(s) = esHΨ(0).

We assume azimuthal symmetry, so only the m = 0 spherical harmonics, with no φ depen-
dence, are included. In the basis of spherical harmonics, the operator in equation (5) is a
symmetric tridiagonal matrix H with diagonal terms

and oﬀ-diagonal terms

The vector of coeﬃcients at point s is given by the matrix exponential of H:

This expression allows us to compute the probability distribution of the tangent vector
orientation at any point along the chain. This result is exact if the inﬁnite series of spherical
harmonics is used. In practice, the series must be truncated for numerical calculations. Our
calculations use N = 30 unless otherwise speciﬁed.

The partition function is then calculated from the inner product

This formula applies for a chain of any length.

Finite-length correction

To calculate the force-extension relation we must determine M = eℓH [equations (12) and
(14)]. Because H includes at least one positive eigenvalue, the entries M grows rapidly with
ℓ. This increase can lead to numerical overﬂow errors when computing M. However, we are

interested not in the entries of the matrix but in the logarithmic derivative of the partition
function, and a rescaling can avoid the overﬂow problem.

Let A = eH and denote by λ∗ the largest eigenvalue of A. Then M = Aℓ. If we deﬁne
∗Aℓ. Thus A has eigenvalues with magnitude less than or equal

A = A/λ∗, we have M = λℓ
to 1. The partition function can be written

Z = λℓ

∗ΨT (s = ℓ)AℓΨ(s = 0).

The logarithm of the partition function is then

ln Z = ℓ ln λ∗ + ln[ΨT (s = ℓ)AℓΨ(s = 0)].

In the usual WLC solution, only the ﬁrst term is considered (3), an approximation which
is exact in the limit ℓ ≫ 1. The second term is the correction to ln Z due to ﬁnite-length
eﬀects.

Boundary conditions

The boundary conditions at s = 0 and s = ℓ aﬀect the force-extension relation, because
they aﬀect the partition function [equation (14)]. The functional form of a speciﬁc boundary
condition is given by the vector of coeﬃcients Ψ(s = 0), which is determined by the projec-
tion of ψ(ˆt, s) onto spherical harmonics. To apply diﬀerent boundary conditions, we simply
determine the partition function for diﬀerent vectors Ψ(s = 0) and Ψ(s = ℓ) (21).

In this paper, we consider three types of boundary conditions (ﬁgure 4). First, in the
“unconstrained” boundary condition the tangent vector at the end of the chain is free to point
in any direction on the sphere (in 4π of solid angle, ﬁgure 4a). In real experiments, however,
the boundary conditions are more constrained. If the polymer is attached to a surface about
a freely rotating attachment point, we might expect “half-constrained” boundary conditions
(ﬁgure 4b), where the tangent vector at the end of the chain can point in any direction on
the hemisphere outside the impenetrable surface. Many experiments appear to implement
half-constrained boundary conditions, because they use a ﬂexible attachment between the
chain and the surface (13). We also consider perpendicular boundary conditions, where the
tangent vector at the end of the chain is parallel to the ˆz axis, normal to the surface (ﬁgure
4c).

For the unconstrained boundary condition, ψ(ˆt) is independent of cos θ. Therefore Ψ =
(1, 0, · · · , 0). For the half-constrained boundary condition, the leading coeﬃcients of Ψ are
(1, 0.8660, 0, -0.3307, 0, 0.2073, 0). Finally, for the perpendicular boundary condition the
coeﬃcients of Ψ are all equal to 1. (Note that for the computation of the force-extension
relation, it is not necessary to properly normalize the probability distribution, because we
are computing the derivative of the logarithm of Z. Our expressions for the probability
distribution vectors will neglect the constant normalization factor.)

Bead rotational ﬂuctuations

The bead rotational ﬂuctuations lead to an eﬀective boundary condition (at the end of the
polymer) that depends on applied force and bead radius. For the single-bead experimental
geometry (ﬁgure 1a), equation (8) gives the partition function of the system including bead
rotational ﬂuctuations. We can perform the integral over ˆn to ﬁnd the probability distri-
bution of ˆt(ℓ), that is, is the eﬀective boundary condition at the end of the polymer. The
integral over ˆn is

g(ˆt(ℓ), ˆz) =

dˆn e−f rˆn·ˆz.

(18)

Zconstr
Because the direction of ˆn is constrained relative to the chain tangent ˆt(ℓ), this integral is a
function of ˆt(ℓ). By azimuthal symmetry, it depends only on the scalar ˆt(ℓ) · ˆz. Accordingly
we can express equation (18) in the form g(ˆt(ℓ) · ˆz), where g is the probability distribution of
tangent angles at s = ℓ. (Note that we neglect the normalization constant for g.) Expanding
in spherical harmonics, we write

g(ˆt(ℓ) · ˆz) = g(cos γ) =

Ψj(s = ℓ)Yj0(γ).

(19)

∞

Xj=0

The eﬀective boundary condition depends on both the applied force and the radius of the
bead. The physical character of the chain-bead attachment determines the constraints in
the integral of equation (18), and therefore controls the Ψj.

For the two-bead experimental geometry, the partition function includes integrals over
bead rotational ﬂuctuations for both ends of the chain, and the eﬀective boundary condition
applies at both ends of the polymer.

Half-constrained boundary conditions

Suppose that the polymer-bead attachment is half-constrained, so the tangent vector is free
in a hemisphere (ﬁgure 4b). Then the integral of equation (18) is constrained by ˆt(ℓ) · ˆn < 0,
or

g(ˆt · ˆz) =

dˆn e−f rˆn·ˆz.

(20)

Zˆt·ˆn<0
To evalute the integral, we choose a polar coordinate system where ˆt · ˆz = cos γ, ˆt points
along the polar axis, and φ = 0 corresponds to the ˆz direction. Therefore ˆz = (sin γ, 0, cos γ),
ˆn = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ), and ˆn · ˆz = sin θ cos φ sin γ + cos θ cos γ. We can then write

for small applied force and small bead radius, the probability distribution approaches a
constant value (independent of cos γ). However, for large applied force, the probability
distribution approaches the half-constrained distribution one would expect in the absence of
bead rotational ﬂuctuations.

Numerical methods
Because cos θ is integrated over negative values in equation (23), the term e−f r cos θ cos γ di-
verges as f r increases. However, we only calculate the dependence of g on cos γ (correct
normalization is not required). Therefore we replace the term e−f r cos θ cos γ in the integral
with the term e−f r(cos θ cos γ+1).

To determine the eﬀective boundary condition due to the rotationally ﬂuctuating bead
requires that we expand integrals of the form given in equation (23) in spherical harmonics.
Direct numerical projection of the integral onto spherical harmonics leads to large errors, be-
cause numerical integration of rapidly oscillating functions (such as the higher-order spherical
harmonics) is inaccurate. To solve this problem, we used an interpolating basis (reference
(30), section 3.1.4). This allows the coeﬃcients of the spherical harmonics to be determined
by evaluation of equation (23) at speciﬁc points (corresponding to the zeros of the Legendre
polynomials). The integral in equation (23) was evaluated numerically using Gauss-Legendre
quadrature.

Results

Here we delineate the regimes where the usual WLC solution applies, and where the FWLC
is required for good agreement with experiment. The classic WLC predictions becomes less
accurate as the contour length of the chain decreases. The diﬀerences between the WLC and
FWLC also depend on applied force, boundary conditions, and bead radius.

As expected, the FWLC predictions converge to the WLC predictions as the polymer
contour length increases. Figure 6 shows the predicted fractional extension z/L as a function

Elasticity of short DNA molecules

11

of the chain contour length L (for ﬁxed applied force). Predictions calculated from the classic
WLC solution are independent of contour length. However, for the FWLC the predicted
fractional extension deviates from the inﬁnite value for smaller values of L. In all cases, the
FWLC predictions converge to the classic WLC results as L → ∞.

Error threshold contour length

To summarize the diﬀerent predictions of the FWLC and WLC, we calculate the “error
threshold contour length” Le. As shown in ﬁgure 6, the FWLC and WLC predictions diverge
as L is decreased. We decrease L and compare the FWLC and WLC predictions. The error
threshold contour length Le is deﬁned as the contour length where the relative diﬀerence
between the two predictions ﬁrst reaches 5%. For contour lengths L < Le the FWLC model
is necessary for accurate predictions. By characterizing the dependence of Le on boundary
conditions, applied force, and bead radius, we can understand which parameters control the
diﬀerence between FWLC and WLC predictions.

Figure 7 shows the error threshold length as a function of applied force for diﬀerent
boundary conditions and bead radii. For all conditions described, Le is largest for low applied
force, where the predicted extension is most altered by ﬁnite-length eﬀects. This behavior is
intuitively reasonable. When the applied force tends to inﬁnity, only one chain conformation
is possible—the chain is perfectly straight, aligned in the direction of the force. In this case,
modifying the theory to include boundary conditions or bead rotational ﬂuctuations does
not alter the polymer conformation. The characteristic propagation length of deformations
A/F . As the force
in a classical elastic rod (that is, neglecting thermal ﬂuctuations) is
increases, the eﬀects of any constraints on the ends of the polymer have decreasing eﬀect
on the conformation. Similarly, when the applied force is large bead rotational ﬂuctuations
require a large amount of energy and are suppressed.

p

When the applied force is low, many diﬀerent chain conformations are probable. There-
fore the boundary conditions and bead rotational ﬂuctuations exert greater inﬂuence on
the chain extension. Unconstrained boundary conditions maximize the number of allowable
In this case the entropy is maximized, and the polymer extension is low:
conformations.
increasing the extension requires excluding many chain conformations, which requires more
work. More constrained boundary conditions restrict the number of conformations that are
possible, leading to lower entropy and therefore a larger extension. At low force, the most
constrained boundary conditions typically lead to the largest extension. We illustrate this
idea with the limit of a perfectly rigid rod which is constrained at one end to be perpendic-
ular to the surface. The inﬁnite rigidity means that the molecule must be perfectly straight.
The boundary conditions require that the polymer take only one conformation, perpendic-
ular to the surface. In other words, the boundary conditions severely restrict the number
of available conformations, and thereby increase the predicted extension. (If the boundary
conditions are unconstrained, the rod rotates to point in many diﬀerent directions and its

Elasticity of short DNA molecules

average extension is lower). In addition, for low applied force bead rotational ﬂuctuations
are larger, leading to a larger alteration of the extension due to bead ﬂuctuations.

Force-extension behavior

We illustrate the force-extension curves for diﬀerent boundary conditions and contour lengths:
L/A = 4 in ﬁgure 8 and L/A = 10 in ﬁgure 9. As described above, (i) the fractional dif-
ference between the inﬁnite and ﬁnite predictions is largest for low contour lengths and low
applied forces, (ii) the more constrained boundary conditions lead to the largest changes
relative to the inﬁnite model, and (iii) the more constrained boundary conditions typically
lead to larger extensions at low force. Therefore, the force-extension curves for the FWLC
with unconstrained boundary conditions are closest to the classic WLC predictions (ﬁgure
8).

Including bead rotational ﬂuctuations in the model leads to an eﬀective boundary con-
dition that depends on applied force and bead radius, as shown in ﬁgure 5. The variation of
the eﬀective boundary condition with force alters the shape of the force-extension curve. For
high applied force, the ﬂuctuations require more energy and so large-angle ﬂuctuations oc-
cur less frequently. Therefore, in the limit F R → ∞ the probability distribution approaches
that of the chain-bead attachment. However, for smaller F R, the bead rotational ﬂuctua-
tions “smear out” the probability distribution, making the eﬀective tangent angle boundary
condition approach a constant, independent of cos γ. For smaller F R, the the predicted
extension is similar to that expected for no bead and unconstrained boundary conditions.
This typically leads to a smaller extension than would occur in the absence of a bead. For
larger F R, the eﬀective boundary condition approaches the boundary condition that would
occur with no bead. In this case, there is little diﬀerence between the predicted extension
with and without a bead.

We note that two opposing trends occur as the bead radius varies: when the bead is
smaller, the fractional error made by subtracting R from the measured extension to estimate
the molecule extension is smaller, simply because one is subtracting a smaller value. However,
for smaller R the restoring torque on the bead for a given F is also smaller, which leads to
larger angular ﬂuctuations for smaller beads.

At very low forces our FWLC theory gives inaccurate predictions, because it does not
explicitly include the exclusion interaction between the bead and the wall. If the force is
very low, the predicted extension would imply that the bead overlaps with the wall (or the
other bead). Typically we ﬁnd that applied force > 0.08 pN is required to prevent predicted
bead-wall overlap in our theory. Although the FWLC does lead to unphysical predictions
at very low forces, the simple model of the bead rotational ﬂuctuations is useful for larger
values of the force.

Fitting FWLC curves to the classic WLC solution

Here we illustrate the typical errors that occur if one ﬁts force-extension curves generated
by the FWLC to the usual WLC solution. We generated force-extension data with the
FWLC, and ﬁt to the WLC solution of Bouchiat et al (7). We ﬁnd that the contour length
is typically ﬁt well by the WLC model, but large errors in the ﬁtted value of the persistence
length occur. The apparent persistence length decreases with contour length (ﬁgure 10), as
observed experimentally in the stretching of short DNA molecules (9). The magnitude of
the error increases as the boundary conditions become more constrained, or when beads are
included in the model.

We emphasize that our ﬁtting result is not directly comparable to the ﬁtting of experi-
mental data, because our simulated “data” are not noisy. In ﬁts of real data, the quality of
the ﬁt is aﬀected by the amount of noise. However, our result does show the types of errors
that occur: ﬁtting “data” generated by the FWLC to the usual WLC solution leads to large
errors in the persistence length for small L. By contrast, ﬁtting to the FWLC recovers the
correct value of A .

Discussion

In this paper we have developed the ﬁnite worm-like chain theory (FWLC), which predicts
the force-elasticity behavior of polymers with short contour lengths (ℓ = L/A ∼ 1–10). In
addition to retaining contributions from the subleading terms of equation (17), the FWLC
includes two physical eﬀects neglected in the usual WLC treatment: (i) chain-end boundary
conditions and (ii) bead rotational ﬂuctuations. Together, these eﬀects may explain the
apparent decrease in polymer persistence length which has been experimentally measured
for short chains (9).

A key result of this paper is the delineation of the regimes where we expect the usual
WLC solution to fail. We demonstrate that the FWLC converges to the WLC in the limit of
long contour length for all forces, boundary conditions, and bead radii. However, for shorter
molecules the contour length crossover where the usual WLC solution becomes inaccurate
depends on applied force, chain-end boundary conditions, and bead radius. For the FWLC
and WLC to agree within 5% for a force-extension measurement with applied force of 0.1–10
pN, requires L/A > 100 (L > 5000 nm for dsDNA).

Although the FWLC improves on the usual WLC solution for short contour lengths,
it does not include all physical eﬀects which occur in single-molecule force microscopy. In
particular, eﬀects omitted from the FWLC are important for very low or zero applied force
(such as in tethered particle motion experiments). These eﬀects include the chain-wall, chain-
bead, and bead-wall exclusion interactions. All of these interactions are most important at
zero applied force. In our calculations, the average position of the bead is “outside” the wall
for forces above 0.1 pN. For accurate predictions at lower applied force, exclusion eﬀects

need to be included. Comparison of the FWLC with models which include the exclusion
interactions can further deﬁne the regimes of applicability of this model. In the future, an
improved theory which also applies at very low force may become necessary.

The FWLC will be useful for experiments that use short NA polymers in single-molecule
force microscopy. A theory that is correct for small L/A helps ensure that the experimental
force calibration is correct, that least-squares ﬁtting indeed recovers the correct values of the
contour and persistence lengths, and that the number of polymers attached between surface
and bead can accurately be determined. The FWLC will facilitate experimental work with
shorter polymers and contribute to future discoveries in nucleic acid-enzyme interactions.

Figure 1.

Sketch of typical experimental geometries for single-molecule force microscopy with nucleic
acid polymers. The total molecule extension is z. (a) One-bead geometry. The molecule is
attached at one end to a surface (glass slide or coverslip) and at other end to a bead. Force
is applied to the center of the bead. (b) Two-bead geometry. The molecule is attached at
both ends to beads. Force is eﬀectively applied to the centers of both beads.

Variables used to describe chain conformations. Force is applied in the ˆz direction. The arc
length along the chain is s, and the vector r(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s)) is the coordinate of the
chain at arc length s. The vector ˆt(s) is the unit vector tangent to the chain at s.

Variables used to describe bead rotational ﬂuctuations. The vector ˆn points from the center
of the bead to the polymer-bead attachment. The angle θ between the ˆz direction and the
bead-chain attachment is deﬁned by cos θ = −ˆn · ˆz. The bead has radius R.

Sketch of the tangent-angle boundary conditions. (a) Unconstrained boundary conditions.
The tangent vector at the end of the chain (open arrowhead) can point in all directions
relative to the ˆz axis (notched arrowhead) with equal probability.
(b) Half-constrained
boundary conditions. Due to a constraint (such as the presence of a solid surface normal
to the ˆz axis) the tangent vector at the end of the chain can point only in the upper half-
sphere. (c) Perpendicular boundary conditions. The tangent vector is constrained to point
only normal to the surface, in the ˆz direction.

Eﬀective chain-end boundary conditions induced by bead rotational ﬂuctuations. The un-
normalized probability density g(ˆt·ˆz) is shown versus cos γ = ˆt·ˆz. Top, bead radius R = 100
nm. Middle, bead radius R = 250 nm. Bottom, bead radius R = 500 nm. The diﬀerent
curves correspond to diﬀerent values of the applied force. In this calculation the attachment
of the chain to the bead is half-constrained: in the absence of bead rotational ﬂuctuations,
the probability density is zero for cos γ < 0 and constant for cos γ > 0. This step function is
approached for large force and large R. For smaller values of F R the probability density is
smeared out, and approaches a constant value (independent of cos γ) for small F R.

Figure 6.

Convergence of the FWLC-predicted extension to the classic WLC prediction for large L.
The predicted fractional extension z/L is shown as a function of the contour length L (at
ﬁxed applied force). The diﬀerent curves correspond to diﬀerent theoretical assumptions:
(i) the classic WLC solution, calculated using the method of ref. (3), (ii) the FWLC with
unconstrained boundary conditions, (iii ) the FWLC with half-constrained boundary con-
ditions , and (iv ) the FWLC with perpendicular boundary conditions (see ﬁgure 4). The
diﬀerent panels show diﬀerent applied forces: top, 0.01 pN; middle, 0.1 pN; bottom, 1 pN.
The polymer persistence length is A = 50 nm. Note that the WLC prediction is independent
of contour length, and the FWLC predictions converge to the WLC prediction as L increases.
The convergence occurs more quickly for higher applied force (see text, note diﬀerent y-axis
scales for diﬀerent panels). For low applied force, the more constrained boundary conditions
lead to larger predicted fractional extension (see text).

Figure 7.

Error threshold length Le as a function of force. The error threshold length is the contour
length where the FWLC- and WLC-predicted extensions diﬀer by 5%. For values of L < Le,
the classic WLC solution gives signiﬁcant errors in the predicted extension. The polymer
persistence length is A = 50 nm. The error threshold length is largest at low force.

Top: no bead. The diﬀerent curves correspond to unconstrained, half-constrained, and
perpendicular boundary conditions. The more constrained boundary conditions have larger
error threshold lengths at low force than the unconstrained boundary condition. Comparable
predicted extensions by the classic WLC solution and the FWLC over the range of forces
and boundary conditions shown requires L > 104 nm (L/A > 200).

Middle: one bead. The boundary conditions are half-constrained on both ends of the
chain. We calculate the extension predicted to the center of the bead, then subtract the bead
radius and compare to the extension predicted by the WLC. Larger bead radii lead to larger
values of Le at small forces, while for larger values of the applied force Le is independent
of the bead radius. Comparable predicted extensions by the classic WLC solution and the
FWLC over the range of forces and boundary conditions shown requires L > 8 × 104 nm
(L/A > 1600).

Bottom: two beads. The boundary conditions are half-constrained on both ends of the
chain. We calculate the extension predicted between the centers of the beads, then subtract
twice the bead radius and compare to the extension predicted by the WLC. Larger bead
radii lead to larger values of Le at small forces, while for larger values of the applied force,
Le is independent of the bead radius. The values of Le are larger for the two-bead case
than the one-bead case. Comparable predicted extensions by the classic WLC solution and
the FWLC over the range of forces and boundary conditions shown requires L > 105 nm
(L/A > 2000).

Figure 8.

Force-extension curves predicted by the FWLC model for L = 200 nm (L/A = 4).

Top: no bead. The diﬀerent curves correspond to the classic WLC solution and the
FWLC with unconstrained, half-constrained, and perpendicular boundary conditions. The
predicted extension for all boundary conditions converges at high force. For low applied force,
the more constrained boundary conditions lead to larger predicted extension (see text).

Middle: one bead. The diﬀerent curves correspond to bead radii of 100, 250, and 500 nm.
The predicted molecule extension (after the bead radius has been subtracted) agrees with
the no-bead prediction for large force, but decreases more rapidly as the force decreases. For
low applied force (below 0.05 pN) the predicted extension becomes negative, because the
bead-wall exclusion interaction is neglected in the model. In this regime the theory gives
unphysical predictions.

Bottom: two beads. The diﬀerent curves correspond to bead radii of 100, 250, and 500
nm. The predicted molecule extension (after twice the bead radius has been subtracted)
agrees with the no-bead and one-bead predictions for large force. For low applied force
(below 0.08 pN) the predicted extension becomes negative, because the bead-bead exclusion
interaction is neglected in the model. In this regime the theory gives unphysical predictions.

Figure 9.

Force-extension curves predicted by the FWLC model for L = 500 nm (L/A = 10). Com-
pared to the curves for L = 200 nm (ﬁgure 8) the eﬀects of boundary conditions and beads
are less important.

Top: no bead. The diﬀerent curves correspond to the classic WLC solution and the

FWLC with unconstrained, half-constrained, and perpendicular boundary conditions.

Middle: one bead. The diﬀerent curves correspond to bead radii of 100, 250, and 500 nm.
For low applied force (below 0.02 pN) the predicted extension becomes negative, because
the bead-wall exclusion interaction is neglected in the model. In this regime the theory gives
unphysical predictions.

Bottom: two beads. The diﬀerent curves correspond to bead radii of 100, 250, and
500 nm. For low applied force (below 0.06 pN) the predicted extension becomes negative,
because the bead-bead exclusion interaction is neglected in the model. In this regime the
theory gives unphysical predictions.

Top: no bead. The diﬀerent curves correspond to the unconstrained, half-constrained,
and perpendicular boundary conditions. The apparent A decreases most for the half-
constrained boundary conditions. The apparent persistence length decreases by more than
a factor of two as L decreases from 104 to 100 nm.

Middle: one bead. The diﬀerent curves correspond to bead radii of 100, 250, and 500 nm.
The decrease in the apparent persistence length is similar to that shown in the top panel,
half-constrained boundary conditions.

Bottom: two beads. The diﬀerent curves correspond to bead radii of 100, 250, and 500
nm. The apparent persistence length decreases more quickly with contour length than for
the one-bead case.

Abstract. We discuss the structure of the equilibrium states of a regularized Keller-Segel model describing
the chemotaxis of bacterial populations. We consider the limit of high degradation of the secreted chemical
where analytical results can be obtained. Below a critical eﬀective temperature, the system experiences
a second order phase transition from a homogeneous phase to an inhomogeneous phase formed by two
domains with uniform concentration separated by a thin interface (domain wall). We study the properties
of the interface and determine the bifurcation between a circular shape (spot) and a stripe as a function
of the control parameters. We show the analogy with the structure of Jupiter’s Great red spot which also
consists of two phases with uniform potential vorticity separated by a thin annular jet.

1 Introduction

The name chemotaxis refers to the motion of organisms in-
duced by chemical signals [1]. In some cases, the biological
organisms secrete a substance (pheromone, smell, food, ...)
that has an attractive eﬀect on the organisms themselves.
Therefore, in addition to their diﬀusive motion, they move
systematically along the gradient of concentration of the
chemical they secrete (chemotactic ﬂux). When attrac-
tion prevails over diﬀusion, the chemotaxis can trigger a
self-accelerating process until a point at which aggrega-
tion takes place. This is the case for the slime mold Dic-
tyostelium Discoideum and for the bacteria Escherichia
coli. A model of slime mold aggregation has been intro-
duced by Patlak [2] and Keller & Segel [3] in the form of
two coupled diﬀerential equations. A simpliﬁed version of
this model has been extensively studied in the case where
the degradation of the secreted chemical can be neglected.
In that case, the Keller-Segel equations become isomor-
phic to the Smoluchowski-Poisson system describing self-
gravitating Brownian particles [4]. An analytical study of
this system of equations has been performed by Chavanis
& Sire [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12] in a series of papers. In partic-
ular, self-similar or quasi self-similar solutions describing
the chemotactic collapse have been obtained and the for-
mation of a Dirac peak has been found in the post-collapse
regime in d > 2 and in the collapse regime in d = 2. In
parallel, a vast number of rigorous results concerning the
existence and unicity of solutions of the Keller-Segel model
and the conditions of blow-up have been obtained by ap-

plied mathematicians (we refer to [13] for a connection to
the mathematical literature).

In this paper, we consider novel aspects of the Keller-
Segel model. We ﬁrst introduce a regularized model that
prevents ﬁnite time-blow up and the formation of (unphys-
ical) singularities like inﬁnite density proﬁles and Dirac
peaks. In this model, the local density of cells is bounded
by a maximum value ρ(r)
σ0 which takes into account
≤
ﬁnite size eﬀects and ﬁlling factors. Therefore, the Dirac
peaks (singularities) are replaced by smooth density pro-
ﬁles (clumps). With this regularization, there exists steady
solutions (similar to the Fermi-Dirac distribution) for any
value of the control parameter while the usual Keller-Segel
model blows up above a critical mass M > Mc (in dimen-
2). In addition, we consider the limit of high
sion d
degradation of the chemical. In this limit, we show that,
for suﬃciently small (eﬀective) temperatures T < Tc, the
system undergoes a second order phase transition from a
homogeneous phase to an inhomogeneous phase. The bac-
teria organize in two domains with uniform density ρ±
separated by a thin interface. The resulting structure is
similar to a “domain wall” in phase ordering kinetics [14].
We study in detail the structure of the interface (proﬁle,
width, surface tension,...) and determine the conditions
for the bifurcation between a circular domain (spot) and
a stripe in a square domain. This study can be performed
analytically in the limit of high degradation (furthermore,
our study is exact in d = 1). The case of a ﬁnite degrada-
tion rate will be treated numerically in another paper.

In previous papers [15,4,16], we have found a number
of analogies between the chemotactic problem and other

systems of physical interest (self-gravitating systems, 2D
vortices, Bose-Einstein condensation, Burgers equation).
As mentioned previously, the Keller-Segel model is iso-
morphic to the Smoluchowski-Poisson system describing
self-gravitating Brownian particles [5]. In this analogy, the
concentration of the chemical produced by the bacteria
plays a role similar to the gravitational potential in as-
trophysical systems (they are both solution of a Poisson
equation) so that a number of analogies between biology
and gravity can be developped [4]. In addition, the collapse
of bacterial populations for M > Mc or the collapse of self-
gravitating Brownian particles for T < Tc is by many re-
spects similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation in phase
space [16]. Finally, there exists some analogies between the
chemotactic aggregation of bacteria and the formation of
large-scale vortices in 2D turbulence [15,4]. In that case,
the concentration of bacteria plays the role of the vor-
ticity and the concentration of the chemical produced by
the bacteria plays the role of the streamfunction. In two-
dimensional hydrodynamics, the vorticity ﬁeld which is
solution of the 2D Euler equation can achieve a statis-
tical equilibrium state (on the coarse-grained scale) as a
result of turbulent mixing (violent relaxation) [17]. In the
two-levels approximation, the equilibrium vorticity pro-
ﬁle is given by a Fermi-Dirac-like distribution [18,19,20,
21]. Interestingly, this is similar to the steady state of the
regularized Keller-Segel model introduced in this paper.
Furthermore, in the quasi-geostrophic (Q.G.) approxima-
tion relevant to geophysical ﬂows [22], the ﬁnite value of
the Rossby deformation radius introduces a shielding of
the interaction between vortices which is formally simi-
lar to the degradation of the chemical in the chemotactic
problem. In particular, the degradation rate k plays the
same role as the inverse of the deformation radius R−1.
In the context of jovian vortices, Sommeria et al. [23] and
Bouchet & Sommeria [24] have considered the limit of a
small deformation radius R
0 to account for the annular
→
jet structure of Jupiter’s great red spot. As we shall see,
this is similar to considering a limit of high degradation in
the chemotactic problem. Therefore, many interesting re-
sults can be obtained by developing the analogies between
these diﬀerent topics.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we in-
troduce a regularized Keller-Segel model of chemotactic
aggregation. We ﬁrst provide a phenomenological deriva-
tion of this model followed by a more kinetic approach.
In Sec. 3, we study the equilibrium states of this model
in a limit of high degradation. For T < Tc, we show that
the solutions are formed by two phases in contact sepa-
rated by an interface (the stability of the uniform phase is
considered in Appendix A). In Secs. 3.1-3.3, we develop a
“domain wall” theory to study the properties of the inter-
face and determine its main characteristics (proﬁle, width,
surface tension,...). Asymptotic behaviors of these expres-
sions are obtained for T
0 in Secs. 3.4 and
3.5. Analytical approximations of the jet proﬁle are given
in Secs. 3.6 and 3.7 in the form of self-similar solutions.
Other approximations are given in Sec. 3.8 using match
asymptotics. In Sec. 3.9, we show that the curvature ra-

dius is constant so that, in two dimensions, the interface is
either a line (stripe) or a circle (spot). These results can be
obtained equivalently by minimizing the free energy func-
tional associated with the regularized Keller-Segel model
(see Sec. 3.10). In Sec. 3.11, we determine the phase dia-
gram of the system and the range of control parameters
(B, T ) where the equilibrium state is a stripe or a spot
(the parameter B is related to the total mass of the con-
ﬁguration). Finally, in Sec. 4, we develop the close anal-
ogy between our biological system and the jet structure of
Jupiter’s great red spot and other jovian vortices.

that govern the evolution of the density of bacteria ρ(r, t)
and the evolution of the secreted chemical c(r, t). The bac-
teria diﬀuse with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient D2 and they also
move in a direction of a positive gradient of the chemi-
cal (chemotactic drift). The coeﬃcient D1 is a measure of
the strength of the inﬂuence of the chemical gradient on
the ﬂow of bacteria. On the other hand, the chemical is
produced by the bacteria with a rate f (c) and is degraded
with a rate k(c). It also diﬀuses with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient
Dc. In the general Keller-Segel model, D1 = D1(ρ, c) and
D2 = D2(ρ, c) can both depend on the concentration of
the bacteria and of the chemical. This takes into account
microscopic constraints, like close-packing eﬀects, that can
hinder the movement of bacteria.

The Keller-Segel model (3)-(4) is known to exhibit
blow-up solutions when the chemotactic attraction pre-
vails over diﬀusion [13,10]. This reproduces the chemo-
tactic aggregation of bacterial populations. In theory, the
density can take arbitrarily large values and ultimately
forms a Dirac peak. In reality, this singular evolution is un-
physical as we expect ﬁnite size eﬀects and close-packing
eﬀects to become important when the system aggregates
and becomes dense enough. We shall regularize the prob-
lem by introducing a sort of ﬁlling factor in the drift-
diﬀusion equation (14). Thus, we take h(ρ) = 1 and g(ρ) =
ρ(1

ρ/σ0) so that Eq. (3) is replaced by

(17)

With this modiﬁcation, the mobility is reduced when the
density becomes high enough (i.e. when ρ approaches the
value σ0) and this prevents singularities to form. Indeed,
it can be shown that the density remains always bounded:
ρ(r, t)
σ0. This bound is similar to the Pauli exclu-
sion principle in quantum mechanics, but it occurs here
in physical space. The regularized drift-diﬀusion equation
(17) was introduced phenomenologically in [15,4] to avoid
inﬁnite values of the density.

In the following, we shall take ǫ = 0 for simplicity
(although many results which are valid at equilibrium are
independent on this assumption). This is valid in a limit
of high diﬀusivity of the chemical [25]. If we introduce
the notations k2 = b/D′ and λ = a/D′, we obtain the
regularized Keller-Segel model

The distribution (20) extremizes the free energy at ﬁxed
mass. Indeed, writing the ﬁrst order variations in the form
δF + αTef f δM = 0 where α is a Lagrange multiplier, we
recover Eq. (20). Furthermore, it can be shown that a
stationary solution of Eqs. (18)-(19) is linearly stable if,
and only if, it is a minimum of F at ﬁxed mass [15].

2.2 Phenomenological derivation of the model

In this section, we develop a connection between the chemo-
tactic problem and thermodynamics. To that purpose, we
introduce the entropic functional (22) from a combinato-
rial analysis which respects an exclusion principle in phys-
ical space. Then, we obtain the dynamical equation (18)
from arguments similar to the linear thermodynamics of
Onsager.

We divide the domain into a very large number of mi-
crocells with size h. We assume that the size h is of the
order of the size of a particle so that a microcell is oc-
cupied either by 0 or 1 particle. This is how the exclu-
sion principle is introduced in the problem. We shall now
group these microcells into macrocells each of which con-
tains many microcells but remains nevertheless small com-
pared to the spatial extension of the whole system. We call
ν the number of microcells in a macrocell. Consider the
where there are n1 particles in the 1st
conﬁguration
macrocell, n2 in the 2nd macrocell etc..., each occupying
one of the ν microcells with no cohabitation. The number
of ways of assigning a microcell to the ﬁrst element of a
macrocell is ν, to the second ν
1 etc. Assuming that
the particles are indistinguishable, the number of ways of
assigning microcells to all ni particles in a macrocell is
thus

To obtain the number of microstates corresponding to the

deﬁned by the number of particles ni in
each macrocell (irrespective of their precise position in the
cell), we need to take the product of terms such as (23)
over all macrocells. Thus, the number of microstates cor-

The entropy is the correct thermodynamical potential
for an isolated system for which the energy is conserved
(microcanonical ensemble). This is not the case for our
system which is dissipative. The proper description is the
canonical ensemble and the correct thermodynamical po-
tential is the free energy F = E

the Fermi-Dirac entropy (22) and the energy (21). The

the linear thermodynamics of Onsager suggests to writing

which is equivalent to Eq. (29). The same results can
be obtained by a variational formulation which is related
to the Maximum Entropy Production Principle (MEPP)
[15]. The rate of dissipation of free energy is given by

and arrival states. This can account for microscopic con-
straints like close-packing eﬀects that can inhibitate the
transition. Quite generally, the evolution of the density

2.3 Kinetic derivation of the model

As discussed previously, Eq. (14) can be viewed as a non-
linear Fokker-Planck equation where the diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient and the mobility explicitly depend on the local
concentration of particles. Such generalized Fokker-Planck
equations can be derived from a kinetic theory, starting
from the master equation, and assuming that the proba-
bilities of transition explicitly depend on the occupation
number (concentration) of the initial and arrival states.
Below, we brieﬂy summarize and adapt to the present sit-
uation the approach carried out by Kaniadakis [26] in a
more general context.

We introduce a stochastic dynamics by deﬁning the
probability of transition of a bacteria from position r to
position r′. Following Kaniadakis [26], we assume the fol-
lowing form

π(r

r′) = w(r, r

r′)a[ρ(r, t)]b[ρ(r′, t)].

(37)

→

−

Usual stochastic processes correspond to a(ρ) = ρ and
b(ρ) = 1: the probability of transition is proportional to
the density of the initial state and independent on the
density of the ﬁnal state. They lead to the Fokker-Planck
equation (3) as will be shown below. Here, we assume a
more general dependence on the occupancy in the initial

3.9 The curvature radius

count for the curvature of the interface. Close to the in-
dξ n where n is a unit vector normal to the
terface,
wall. Introducing the curvature r−1 =
n (r is the curva-
ture radius), we get ∆ψ = d2ψ/dξ2+r−1dψ/dξ. Therefore,

obtain the relation

which shows that the radius of curvature r is constant.
Therefore, the shape of the interface is either a circle (lead-
ing to a spot) or a straight line (leading to a stripe). Equa-
tion (123) is similar to Laplace’s law relating the curvature
radius of bubbles to the surface tension and to the diﬀer-
ence of pressure between the interface.

For T

The previous results can be recovered by minimizing the

& Sommeria [24] in the context of jovian vortices where
the problem is similar (see Sec. 4). Therefore, their study
can be directly applied to the present situation and we
shall only give the main steps of the analysis.

To leading order in k−1

two phases with uniform density ρ±1 and size A±1 (we
call A = A+ + A− the total size of the domain). Setting

The optimal values of ρ±1 and A±1 are obtained by mini-
mizing the free energy (124). The variations on ρ±1 imply
that

f ′(ρ±1) = 0,

f ′′(ρ±1) > 0.

(126)

and the variations on A1 imply that

f (ρ1) = f (ρ−1).

(127)

This relation expresses the equality of the free energy of
the two phases. The only possibility to satisfy the relations
(126)-(127) simultaneously is to have α = 2C so that f (φ)
is an odd function. This is equivalent to the solvability
condition (65) leading to χ
1 = 0. Then, it
is straightforward to check that f ′(ρ) = 0 implies that

This returns the relation (68)-b.

To ﬁrst order in k−1, we need to determine the contri-
bution of the free energy contained in the wall (interface).

Using ˜h(φ±1) = ˜h(u) = 0 and tanh(Cφ)
φ (see Fig.
1), we ﬁnd that FW > 0. Therefore, minimizing the free
energy amounts to minimizing the length of the interface
at ﬁxed area. This gives either a circle or a straight line and

≥

(130)

(131)

this returns the fact that the curvature radius is constant
(see Sec. 3.9). This argument also shows that it is more
proﬁtable to form, at equilibrium, a single “bubble” of size
A rather than several “droplets” of smaller size. However,
a conﬁguration with several “droplets” can exist as a non-
equilibrium solution of the regularized Keller-Segel model
(18)-(19). These droplets will evolve in time and merge
together to ﬁnally form a single “bubble” (spot or stripe).
This is similar to a coarsening process in spin systems or
to the aggregation of vortices in 2D decaying turbulence
[28].

3.11 Bifurcations: spots and stripes

We shall work in a square domain with total size A. We
consider periodic boundary conditions in order to avoid
boundary eﬀects. The equilibrium state consists in two
phases with uniform density (ρ+, A+) and (ρ−, A−) with
A+ + A− = A. We introduce the parameter

The phase diagram is represented in Fig. 17. This is the
counterpart to the diagram obtained by Bouchet & Som-

lent of the ‘vortices’ and the ‘stripes’ are the equivalent of
the ‘jets’. The main diﬀerence (beyond the context and the
interpretation of the solutions) is that the control parame-
ter in our case is the eﬀective temperature T (“canonical”

4 Analogy with Jupiter’s great red spot

4.1 The physical context

Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (GRS) is probably the most fa-
mous example of vortex structures found in planetary at-
mospheres. The presence of this spot was ﬁrst reported
by Robert Hooke in 1664 in the ﬁrst issue of the Philo-
sophical Transaction of the Royal Society. The GRS is
a large “eye” that dominates the southern hemisphere
of the planet. It is an oval-shaped anticyclone with size

Fig. 17. Phase diagram of the regularized chemotactic model
(18)-(19) showing the bifurcation between ‘spots’ and ‘stripes’
as a function of the control parameters (B, T ). In a bounded
domain, the solutions exist only for T ≤ Tmax(B). We have
drown the line of transition T0(B) between the two structures.
Finally, the dashed line corresponds to the domain of validity of
our perturbative expansion; it has been plotted for Ak2 = 1000.

26000km by 13000km. Its breadth is about one hundred
times its height so it can be considered approximately
two-dimensional. It resides in a zonal shear at latitude
23S where the velocity changes sign, is elongated along
the shear zone and is of the same sign as the background
shear (these are relatively general rules observed for other
vortices). It stays at the same latitude but slowly drifts
in longitude. Morphologically, the GRS has a striking an-
nular structure with a quiet center surrounded by a thin
intense jet. The concentration of winds in an annulus is
consistent with the fact that the GRS is much larger than
the atmosphere’s radius of deformation (the jet’s width
scales with the Rossby radius of deformation).

Some authors have tried to describe this spot as a soli-
ton solution of a modiﬁed KdV equation but this interpre-
tation as a weakly nonlinear structure faces several draw-
backs: the jet structure is not reproduced and the soli-
ton theory predicts an interpenetration without change of
structure while the main interaction between vortices is
a merging process. In contrast, Marcus [29] argues that
a permanent vortex can coexist with turbulence and that
most of the properties of the Jovian vortices can be eas-
ily explained and understood with the quasi-geostrophic
(QG) theory. In addition, he emphasizes the jet structure
of the GRS and shows that an annular jet is the natural
structure of a vortex with a uniform potential vorticity in-
side and outside the spot. A physical justiﬁcation of this
construction was given by Sommeria et al. [23] in terms
of statistical mechanics. A statistical theory of 2D tur-
bulence has been developed by Miller [19] and Robert &
Sommeria [20] following and generalizing the pioneering
work of Onsager [30] on point vortices. This theory is able
to account for the typical vortices (monopoles, dipoles,
tripoles,...) observed in two-dimensional ﬂows [31]. In the

QG model, and in the limit of small Rossby radius, PV
mixing (entropic eﬀects) with constraints on the energy
leads to an equilibrium state that consists of two phases
with uniform PV in contact separated by a strong jet. This
precisely account for the morphology of the GRS. This
model has been further developed by Bouchet & Somme-
ria [24] with quantitiative applications to Jovian vortices.
Another model has been proposed by Turkington et al.
[32]. It predicts the emergence of a vortex solution at the
correct latitude but it does not reproduce the annular jet
structure of the GRS [33].

4.2 Statistical mechanics of the quasi-geostrophic
equations

The quasi-geostrophic equations appropriate to the dy-
namics of geophysical ﬂows [22] can be written:

Here, q is the potential vorticity (PV) and ψ the stream
function (ˆz is a unit vector normal to the two-dimensional
ﬂow). We have assumed that the topography Rh(y) scales
with the Rossby radius R. The Q.G. equations admit an
inﬁnite number of stationary solutions speciﬁed by any
relationship q = f (ψ). For given initial conditions, the
statistical theory selects the most probable state consis-
tent with the constraints imposed by the dynamics. It is
obtained by maximizing a mixing entropy at ﬁxed energy
and Casimir constraints [19,20,21].

Let us consider the situation where the ﬁne-grained
PV q takes only two values

Robert & Sommeria [34] have proposed a parameteri-
zation of 2D turbulence in the form of a relaxation equa-
tion for the coarse-grained PV q(r, t). This parameteriza-
tion is based on a Maximum Entropy Production Principle
(MEPP). The diﬀusion current (due to turbulent mixing)
is assumed to maximize the rate of entropy production
˙S while conserving all the constraints imposed by the dy-
namics. In the two-levels case, this yields a system of equa-
tions of the form

Interestingly, these drift-diﬀusion equations are similar to
the regularized chemotactic model (18)-(19). In this anal-
ogy, the coarse-grained PV q plays the role of the bacterial
concentration and the stream function ψ the role of the
chemical c. This analogy was noted in [4]. An important
diﬀerence, however, is that in 2D turbulence the energy is
conserved so that the inverse temperature β(t) evolves in
time. By contrast, in the chemotactic problem, we are in
a situation where the ‘eﬀective temperature’ Tef f = 1/β
is ﬁxed. Therefore, 2D turbulence corresponds to a micro-
canonical situation (where we maximize the entropy S at
ﬁxed energy E) while chemotaxis corresponds to a canon-
ical situation (where we minimize an eﬀective free energy
Tef f S). These two situations are described in
F = E
), the
[15]. For long-range interactions (k = 0 or R
‘ensembles’ are generically inequivalent. However, in the
limit that we consider here, corresponding to a short-range
interaction, they become equivalent, i.e. the β(E) curve is
univalued (see Fig. 18).

The equilibrium problem (140)-(143) has been studied
in the limit of small Rossby radius R
0. The original
idea dates back to Sommeria et al. [23] who understood
that, in this limit, the solution is made of two uniform
PV regions separated by a strong jet. This model has
been developed quantitatively by Bouchet & Sommeria
[24] with comparison to jovian data. Our study of the reg-
ularized chemotactic problem has been directly insiped
by these works. In complement, we have provided in Sec.
3 a more thorough study of the wall equation with use-
ful asymptotic expansions and analytical approximations.
Due to the analogy between the two problems, these re-
sults can also be relevant to describe the jet structure of
jovian vortices, like GRS. In this respect, we recall that
the GRS corresponds to a typical parameter u in the range
0.92
0 of our
study (Secs. 3.5, 3.7 and 3.8) is particularly interesting in
that respect. To strenghten the comparison between the
two problems (chemotaxis and jovian vortices), we brieﬂy
recall the main lines of the study of Bouchet & Sommeria
[24] and provide some complementary discussion.

text, the parameter u is determined by the energy accord-

which relates the radius of curvature r to the underlying
topography h(y). For a given topography, Eq. (157) deter-
mines the form of the jet. This problem has been studied
in detail in Bouchet & Sommeria [24] in the case of a
quadratic topography. As another example, we consider
here the inverse problem: given the form of the jet, ﬁnd
the corresponding topography. We consider the case of an
elliptical vortex (see Fig. 19) because this is a relatively
good representation of Jupiter’s great red spot and we can
obtain analytical results in that case.

The topography leading to an elliptic vortex has the

natively, if we assume a topography of the form (158) we
ﬁnd an elliptic vortex for all the values of χ

fore, the form of the vortex is relatively sensitive to the
underlying topography.

This is similar to the situation considered by Bouchet &

ellipse whose major and minor semi-axis are given by Eqs.

In this paper, we have studied the equilibrium states of
a regularized version of the Keller-Segel model describ-
ing the chemotactic aggregation of bacterial colonies. The
regularization is justiﬁed physically in order to avoid the
formation of singularities (Dirac peaks) during the dynam-
ics and obtain smooth density proﬁles (clumps) instead.
This regularization accounts for ﬁnite size eﬀects and close
packing eﬀects. In that case, an equilibrium state exists for
any value of the control parameter (this is similar to con-
sidering a gas of self-gravitating fermions in astrophysics
to avoid complete gravitational collapse [35]). We have

In previous works [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12], the opposite limit
k = 0 (no degradation) was considered instead. The inter-
mediate case of a ﬁnite degradation must be studied nu-
merically (in preparation). However, the asymptotic limit
allows us to obtain analytical results that permit
k
to have a clear picture of the bifurcation diagram (between
spots and stripes) in parameter space. Furthermore, our
approach is exact in one dimension, for any value of the
degradation rate k. Our study shows that the physics of

We have also discussed the analogy between the orga-
nization of bacteria (in stripes and spots) in the chemo-
tactic problem and the organization of two-dimensional
turbulent ﬂows (in jets and vortices) in the jovian atmo-
sphere. These apparently completely diﬀerent systems are
however described by relatively similar equations so that

an interesting analogy can be developed between the two.
In this analogy, the jet structure of Jupiter’s great red spot
can be seen as a ‘domain wall’ that is similar to the inter-
face separating two phases in contact, as in the biological
problem.

A Stability analysis

We study the linear dynamical stability of an inﬁnite and
homogeneous solution of the regularized Keller-Segel model
(18)-(19). The unperturbed solution is such that

k2c = λρ.

(164)

Linearizing Eqs. (18)-(19) around this steady state and
writing the perturbation as δρ = δ ˆρeiq·reσt, δc = δˆceiq·reσt,
we obtain

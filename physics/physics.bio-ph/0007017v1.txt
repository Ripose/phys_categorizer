ABSTRACT

A mathematical framework for the internal conformational dynamics and
external mechanical movement of single biological macromolecules in aque-
ous solution at constant temperature is developed. Both the internal dy-
namics and external movement are stochastic; the former is represented by
a master equation for a set of discrete states, and the latter is described by
a continuous Smoluchowski (Fokker-Planck) equation. Combining these
two equations into one, a comprehensive theory for the dynamic of macro-
molecules arises. This approach is shown to have wide applications. It
is applied to protein-ligand dissociation under external force, unfolding of
polyglobular proteins under extension, movement along linear tracks of
motor proteins against load, and catalysis by ﬂuctuating enzymes. The
dynamic equation is capable of characterizing thermodynamic equilib-
rium with ﬂuctuations, transient relaxation kinetics, and nonequilibrium
steady-state. A reversibility condition which guarantees the equilibrium
solution and its asymptotic stability is introduced, and pumping under
irreversible settings is discussed.

Introduction

I have not formally worked with Joel Keizer. However, he has been like a mentor
to me in the past 10 years mainly because our common interests in nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics and biophysics, and because of Terrell Hill. One can easily ﬁnd
the inﬂuence of his work on what I present here. For quite a while, I had wanted to
hear his comments on this work. Though the wish will forever unfulﬁlled, I like to
dedicate this paper to Joel.

Progress in optics, electronics, and computer science has now made it possible to
study biological macromolecules in aqueous solution at constant temperature by ob-
serving experimentally and measuring quantitatively the behavior of single biological
macromolecules. These studies have been providing and will continue to yield impor-
tant information on the behavior and properties of individual biomolecules and to re-
veal molecular interactions in and the mechanisms of biological processes. The impact
which single-molecule studies will have on molecular biology may be gauged by com-
parison with the pioneering studies on single channel proteins in membranes, which
have revolutionized physiology (Sakmann and Neher, 1995). The highly quantitative
data obtained in these novel measurements, with piconewton and nanometer precision
on the forces and movements of single biological macromolecules, complement those
from traditional kinetic studies and structural determinations at the atomic level.

The novel experimental approach requires new theoretical framework for quanti-
tatively understanding, interpreting, and integrating laboratory data (Xie and Traut-
men, 1998, Xie and Lu, 1999, Qian and Elson, 1999, Qian, 2000b,c). The objective
is to develop a unifying molecular theory which is capable of integrating the three
classes of quantitative measurements on macromolecules: macroscopic (kinetic spec-
troscopies), mesoscopic (single molecules), and microscopic (atomic structures). In
this paper, we show how the spectroscopically deﬁned kinetics, expressed in terms of
discrete conformational states, is integrated with the mechanics of a macromolecule.
The philosophy behind this approach, Stochastic Macromolecular Mechanics, is that
we realize the impracticality of representing the entire conformational space of a
macromolecule with a high-dimensional energy function. Hence we still rely on a
discrete-state Markov model with experimentally deﬁned “states” and kinetic pa-
rameters. However, we introduce a continuous energy landscape when there are
experimental data on which to base from studies on single molecules. Therefore
the stochastic macromolecular mechanics is a mix of the discrete-state Markov ki-
netics with Brownian dynamics based on available and relevant experimental data.
It is a mesoscopic theory with a single set of equations. The theoretical approach
helps researchers to identify the relevant (random) variables and key parameters in a
macromolecular system or process, and the equations follow.

The discrete-state master equation approach has been generally recognized as
the natural mathematical description for biochemical kinetics of individual molecules
(cf. McQuarrie, 1967, Keizer, 1987). With more detailed information on molec-

2

ular structures and energetics, the Smoluchowski’s continuous description of over-
damped Brownian dynamics has found numerous applications in condensed matter
physics, solution chemistry and also biochemistry of macromolecules (Agmon and
Hopﬁeld, 1983a,b and references therein, also see a review by H¨anggi et al., (1990) on
closely related work with Kramers’ approach which obviates the overdamping assump-
tion). In dealing with a single protein molecule, the discrete approach is appropriate
for spectroscopic studies while the continuous approach is necessary for mechanical
measurements. By combining these two descriptions, the stochastic macromolec-
ular mechanics treats the internal conformational dynamics of proteins as well as
its external mechanics.
In particular, both internal and external forces are explic-
itly considered. On the mathematical level, such a combination leads to coupled
stochastic processes (Qian and Zhang, 1984), giving rise to three diﬀerent classes of
problems: reversible stationary processes (in a physicist’s term, thermal equilibrium
with ﬂuctuations), nonstationary processes (kinetic transient), and irreversible sta-
tionary processes (pumped nonequilibrium steady-state). The last class of processes
is mathematically novel (Qian et al., 1991, Qian, 2000d) and necessary for modeling
motor protein (e.g. kinesin and myosin) movement and energetics (Hill, 1977, 1989,
Peskin et al., 1994, Astumian, 1997, Qian, 1997, 2000a).

The diﬀerential equations in stochastic macromolecular mechanics are Fokker-
Planck-Master type (linear diﬀusion-convection equations with variable coeﬃcients,
c.f. Fox, 1978, Keizer, 1987).
Its basis is conservation of probability. This type
of equations is diﬀerent from the well-studied nonlinear diﬀusion-reaction equations
(Murray, 1993, Qian and Murray, 2000) with distinctly diﬀerent mathematical struc-
tures (Qian, 1998a).

Macromolecular Mechanics of Protein-Ligand Dissociation

In this section, we study the dissociation of a single protein-ligand complex under
an external force introduced by an experimenter (Florin et al., 1994, Moy et al.,
1994, Chilkoti et al., 1995). As in any mechanics, the ﬁrst question to ask is in what
“object(s)” one is interested. In this case it is the position of the ligand with respect
to the center of the mass of the protein. The next question is what is the forces
acting on the ligand. This leads to a Newtonian equation in which one neglects the
acceleration term

= Fint(x) + Fext(x, t) + f (t).

(1)

β

dx
dt

The four terms are (i) frictional force with frictional coeﬃcient β, (ii) intermolecu-
lar force between the ligand and the protein, with potential energy function Uint(x):
Fint(x)=−dUint(x)/dx, (iii) the external force, and (iv) the stationary, pure random
force due to collisions between the ligand and the solvent molecules: hf (t)i = 0. Be-
cause of the presence of the random force f (t), the movement x(t) is stochastic, e.g.,

3

it is a Brownian motion. Mathematically equivalent, the Smoluchowski’s descrip-
tion of overdamped Brownian dynamics is based on a partial diﬀerential equation of
parabolic type (van Kampen, 1997):

β

∂P (x, t)

∂t

= kBT

∂2P (x, t)

∂x2 −

∂
∂x

[(Fint(x) + Fext(x, t))P (x, t)]

(2)

where P (x, t) is now the probability density of the ligand being at x at time t. kB
is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature which characterizes the magnitude
of the random force f (t): hf (t)f (t′)i = 2kBT δ(t − t′).

The above Eq. (1) and (2) have laid the basis for all models, but the choices for
Uint(x) and Fext set the diﬀerence between diﬀerent models. In the work of Shapiro
and Qian (1997,1998, Qian and Shapiro, 1999), Uint = V0[(x0/x)12 − 2(x0/x)6] with
a smooth repulsive force, and Fext = k(x − d(t)) where k is the stiﬀness of the
force probe exerting the external force, and d(t) is the position of the piezoelectric
motor which drives the force probe. In the work of Evans and Ritchie (1997,1999),
Uint = −V0(x0/x)n (x > x0) with an abrupt repulsion at x0, and Fext = −F (t) is
independent of x. These diﬀerences give qualitatively similar but qualitative diﬀerent
results. Hence they can be quantitatively tested against experimental date.

Macromolecular Mechanics of Polyglobular Protein Unfolding

In the previous analysis of protein-ligand dissociation, we have completely ne-
glected the conformational change within the protein itself. The protein was treated
as a rigid body exerting a force on the ligand. A more realistic model will have to
consider the possibility of internal protein conformational change due to the external
force, acting via the ligand. In this section, we study the unfolding of a polyglobu-
lar protein under extensional force. This problem naturally brings out the internal
dynamics of the macromolecules.

To be concrete, let’s consider the recent experimental work on giant muscle protein
titin (Kellermayer et al., 1997, Rief et al., 1997, Tskhovrebova et al., 1997). Titin is a
protein with many globular domains (subunits) in serial. The subunits unfold under
an external force pulling the entire molecule. The folded state of each subunit is rigid,
and the unfolded state of each subunit can be regarded as a coiled polymer spring.
Hence the conformational state of the entire protein, to a ﬁrst order approximation,
can be characterized by n: the number of unfolded subunits within the molecule.
Let’s assume the total number of subunits are N, and let x be the total extension of
the titin molecule (along the axis of external force), then a realistic characterization
of a titin molecule is by two dynamic variables (x, n), (x ≥ 0, 0 ≤ n ≤ N).

The equation of motion for x is again

β

dUint(x, n)

+ Fext + f (t)

(3)

in which n is itself a random (Markov) process. Hence the above equation is coupled
to a master equation

∂P (n, t)

∂t

= (N − n + 1)λu(x, n − 1)P (n − 1, t) + (n + 1)λf (x, n + 1)P (x, n + 1, t)

− [nλf (x, n) + (N − n)λu(x, n)]P (n, t)

(4)

where P (n, t) is the probability for n at time t. λf and λu are folding and unfolding
rate constants of individual subunits. They are function of the force acting on the
subunit, which in turn is determined by the total extension of the molecule (x) and
the number of unfolded domains in the chain (n).

A comprehensive description of both the internal dynamics and external movement

can be obtained by combining Eq. (3) and (4). We therefore have

∂P (x, n, t)

+ Fext! P (x, n, t)#

(5)

where P (x, n, t) is the joint probability distribution of the titin molecule having
internally n unfolded domains and external extension x.

As in the previous section, particular models will have to provide speciﬁc λf (x, n),
λu(x, n), and Uint(x, n). These functions are not totally independent, however. Ther-
modynamic reversibility dictates that

This condition guarantees that the stationary solution to Eq. (5) is a thermodynamic
equilibrium. Furthermore, this reversibility condition (also known as potential
condition) also guarantees the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium solution. As we
shall see below, without such a constraint, the stationary solution in general represents
a nonequilibrium steady-state.

With the reversibility condition and in the absence of external force Fext, it is easy

to verify that the stationary solution to Eq. (5) is

P ∗(x, n) = Z −1e−U (x,n)/kB T

(7)

where

Z =

Xn=0Z ∞

The time-dependent solutions to (5) are dynamic models for transient kinetics of
macromolecules.

We now show that the equilibrium solution P ∗(x, n) is asymptotically stable. We

introduce the free energy functional:

A[P (x, n, t)] =

in which the second term (also known as relative entropy, see Mackey, 1989) is always
nonnegative and equal to zero if and only if P (x, n, t) = P ∗(x, n). Based on Eq. (5)
the time derivative of A is

˙A[P (x, n, t)] = −

The integrand in Eq. (8) is always positive. Hence A is a Lyapunov functional for
the time-dependent solution of Eq. (5), which guarantees P ∗ to be asymptotically
stable.

The physical interpretation of the above result is straightforward: the free energy
of a closed, isothermal molecular system monotonically decreases to its minimum
−kBT ln Z, when the system reaches its equilibrium. The dynamics in Eq.
(5),
however, is not governed by the gradient of the free energy.

Macromolecular Mechanics of Motor Protein Movement

With the presence of the reversibility condition, the previous model represents a
“passive” complex molecule. Without the external force, such molecules relax to a
thermodynamic equilibrium. They are biochemically interesting, but they are not
“alive”. One could argue that one of the fundamental properties of a living organism
is the ability to convert energy among diﬀerent forms (solar to electrical, electrical to
chemical, chemical to mechanical, etc.). We now show how stochastic macromolecular
mechanics can be used to develop models for chemomechanical energy transduction
in single motor proteins (Howard, 1996).
In the absence of an external force, a
motor protein is undergoing nonequilibrium steady-state with ATP hydrolysis and
generating heat – the most rudimentary form of energy metabolism.

6

The key for developing a theory for motor protein is to consider that while bio-
chemical studies of a protein in test tubes probe a set of discrete conformational
states of the molecule, the mechanical studies of a protein measure positions and
forces.
Internally, a motor protein has many diﬀerent internal states within a hy-
drolysis cycle, and a reaction scheme usually can be suggested from various kinetic
studies. While the protein is going through its conformational cycles, its center of
mass moves along its designated linear track (e.g., kinesin on a microtubule, myosin
on an actin ﬁlament, and polymerase on DNA) which usually has a periodic structure.
The movement is stochastic; the interaction between the motor and the track (the
force ﬁeld) are usually diﬀerent for diﬀerent internal states of the molecule.

These basic facts lead to the following equation

∂P (x, n, t)

(9)

+

N

where P (x, n, t) denote the joint probability of a motor protein with internal state n
and external position x. Uint(x, n) is the interaction energy between the protein in
state n and the track. λℓm(x) is the transition rate constant from internal state ℓ to
state m when the protein is located at x. Some of the λ’s are pseudo-ﬁrst order rate
constants which contain the concentrations [ATP], [ADP], and [Pi].

When the ratio [ADP][Pi]/[ATP] is at its equilibrium value (i.e., equilibrium con-

stant), the U(x, n) and λℓm(x) are again constrained by the reversibility:

λℓm(x)
λmℓ(x)

= exp −

Uint(x, m) − Uint(x, ℓ)

kBT

! .

(10)

It is clear, however, that when the ATP, ADP, and Pi are sustained at an arbitrary
values, the stationary solution of the Eq.
(9) will be in general a nonequilibrium
steady-state. Sustaining the concentration is a form of “pumping” which keeps the
system at nonequilibrium steady-state (Qian and Qian, 2000) with positive entropy
production and heat generation (Qian, 2000d). Such a molecular device is also known
as isothermal ratchet (for a review, see J¨ulicher et al., 1997, Qian, 1998a). If the
concentrations are not actively sustained, then they will change slowly (since there
is only a single molecule at work hydrolyzing ATP) and eventually reach a thermal
equilibrium at which (10) will be satisﬁed.

As in the previous sections, a practical model requires speciﬁc choices for the
parameters U and λ. In the past several years, a large amount of work have appeared
on modeling translational motor proteins such as myosin and kinesin and rotational
motor proteins such as ATP synthase (Elston et al., 1998, Wang and Oster, 1998).

Macromolecular Mechanics of Fluctuating Enzyme

7

Equilibrium conformational ﬂuctuation of proteins play an important role in en-
zyme kinetics. The theory of ﬂuctuating enzyme (Blomberg, 1989) can be developed
naturally in terms of the equations of stochastic macromolecular mechanics. Let’s
consider a single enzyme, with its internal conformation characterized by x, and N
number of substrate molecules. The enzyme catalyzes a reversible isomerization reac-
tion between two forms of the substrate (reactant and product), with rate constants
λ+(x) and λ−(x).

The equation for the catalytic reaction coupled with the enzyme conformational

ﬂuctuation, according to stochastic macromolecular mechanics, is

∂P (n, x, t)

∂t

= −[nλ+ + (N − n)λ−]P (n, x, t) + (n + 1)λ+P (n + 1, x, t)

+ (N − n + 1)λ−P (n − 1, x, t) + D

∂2P (n, x, t)

+ k

∂
∂x

(xP (n, x, t)),

(11)

∂x2
(0 ≤ n ≤ N)

where P (n, x, t) is the probability of at time t having n number of reactant molecules
and the enzyme internal conformation being at x. D and k characterize the protein
conformational ﬂuctuation. x is perpendicular to the isomerization reaction coor-
dinate as ﬁrst proposed by Agmon and Hopﬁeld (1983a), in contrast to the other
models which address random energy landscape along the reaction coordinate (e.g.,
Zwanzig, 1988). Eq. (11), which is essentially the same equation for the treatment
of polyglobular protein unfolding (Eq. 5), uniﬁes and generalizes several important
work on ﬂuctuating enzymes.

Along this approach, most work in the past have addressed the non-stationary,
time-dependent solution to 11. These studies are motivated by macroscopic experi-
ments which are initiated (t = 0) with all the substrate in only the reactant form. If
λ−(x) = 0 and N = 1, Eq. (11) is reduced to that of Agmon and Hopﬁeld (1983a).
If λ−(x) = 0 but N is large, then one can introduce a continuous variable ξ = n/N,
known as the survival probability, and Eq. (11) can be approximated as (see Appendix
I for more discussion)

∂P (ξ, x, t)

∂t

∂
∂ξ

(12)

At t = 0, Prob{ξ = 1} = 1.

0 ξmP (ξ, x, t)dξ, can be easily obtained from Eq.

The moments of ξ, hξmi(x, t) = R 1

(12):

∂hξmi

∂t

= −mλ+(x)hξmi + D

∂2hξmi
∂x2 + k

∂
∂x

(xhξmi) .

(13)

Note Eq. (11) with N = 1 and Eq. (13) for hξi are idential. For λ+(x) = αx2 +βx+γ,
Eq. (13) can be exactly solved by various methods if one realizes that its solution has
a Gaussian form (Zwanzig, 1992, Wang and Wolynes, 1993,1994, also see Appendix

8

II). From Eq. (13) one immediately sees that high-order moments hξmi is related to
hξi by λ+(x) → mλ+(x) (Wang and Wolynes, 1995).

Diﬀerent choices for λ+(x) lead to quantitatively diﬀerent models for ﬂuctuating
enzymes in the literature. λ+(x) ∝ e−αx represents a ﬂuctuating activation energy
barrier (Agmon and Hopﬁeld, 1983a); λ+(x) = α(x + x) (> 0) representing a ﬂuctu-
ating cofactor concentration (DiCera, 1991); λ+(x) = αx2 representing a ﬂuctuating
geometric bottleneck (Zwanzig, 1992).

We now consider the reversible reaction (with λ−(x) 6= 0) which previously has
not been discussed. This class of models is appropriate for recent measurements on
single-molecule enzymology (Xie and Lu, 1999). Again we assume N being large.
Hence we have

∂t

(Vx(x, ξ)P (ξ, x, t))

(14)

where Dξ(ξ, x) = [ξλ+ + (1 − ξ)λ−]/2N and Vξ = ξλ+ − (1 − ξ)λ−. Eq. (14) is a 2D
diﬀusion-convection equation similar to a continuous model we proposed for motor
protein movement (Qian, 1998a). One important consequence of this formulation is
to realize that conformational ﬂuctuation of the enzyme, Vx can not be independent of
the substrate. This constitutes the essential idea of induced ﬁt (Koshland, 1958, Qian,
1998b, Qian and Hopﬁeld, 1996). For equilibrium ﬂuctuation, again reversibility (i.e.,
potential condition) dictates (Qian, 1998a):

(15)

where λ′ = dλ(x)/dx. Therefore,

Vx(x, ξ) = −

λ+λ−

(λ+ − λ−)3[λ+ξ + λ−(1 − ξ)]

+ V0(x)

(16)

where V0(x) is an arbitrary function of x but it is independent of ξ. As can be seen,
if λ− << λ+, then there is no requirement for ξ-dependent Vx.

Conclusions

Biological macromolecules are the cornerstone of molecular biology. Mathematical
modeling of molecular processes requires a theoretical basis upon which quantitative

9

analyses can be carried out and rigorously compared with experiments. In this paper,
a formal theory, we call stochastic macromolecular mechanics, is presented. The
theory oﬀers a dynamic equation for describing the internal kinetics as well as external
motion of macromolecules in aqueous solution at constant temperature. Systemat-
ically applying this theory to various biomolecular processes will bring molecular
biophysics closer to the standard of theoretical physics, and hopefully in the near
future the Smoluchowski equation will acquire the same towering stutus as that of
Newton’s for mechanics, Euler’s for ﬂuid dynamics, Maxwell’s for electrodynamics,
Schr¨odinger’s for quantum mechanics, and Boltzmann’s for statistical mechanics of
isolated systems.

Appendix I

Let’s use the well-known linear death process (Taylor and Karlin, 1998) as an

example to illustrate the continuous approximation for the discrete model:

dPn(t)

dt

= −nλPn(t) + (n + 1)λPn+1(t)

(17)

where Pn(t) is the probability of survival population being n at time t. The solution
to this equation is well known (Taylor and Karlin, 1998)

Pn(t) =

N!

n!(N − n)!

e−nλt(cid:16)1 − e−λt(cid:17)N −n

where N is the total population at time t = 0. It is easy to show that the moments

hn(t)i = Ne−λt,

hn2(t)i
hn(t)i2 = 1 +
hn3(t)i
hn(t)i3 = 1 +

N 2 (cid:16)e2λt − 1(cid:17) .

We now consider the continuous counterpart of (17) with ξ = n/N:

∂P (ξ, t)

∂t

=

∂
∂ξ

(ξP (ξ, t))

which has solution

for initial condition P (ξ, 0) = δ(ξ − 1). The moments for ξ are

P (ξ, t) = eλtδ(cid:16)ξeλt − 1(cid:17)

hξk(t)i = e−kλt.

(19)

Comparing (18) and (19), we note that the continous approximation is valid when
the N is large and t is small. More precisely, ln N ≫ λt.

(xu) − (αx2 + βx + γ)u

In Gaussian form (Zwanzig, 1992) which is equivalent to path integral calculation
(Wang and Wolynes, 1993) u(x, t) = [2πσ(t)]−1/2 exp {ν(t) − [x − µ(t)]2/2σ2(t)}, and
equate coeﬃcients of like order terms in x we have

dν/dt = −α[µ2(t) + σ2(t)] − βµ(t) − γ
dµ/dt = −[k + 2ασ2(t)]µ(t) − βσ2(t)
dσ2/dt = 2D − 2kσ2(t) − 2ασ4(t)

with initial condition σ2(0) = D/k, µ(0) = 0, and ν(0) = 0. We thus have

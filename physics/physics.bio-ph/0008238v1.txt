Abstract

Autocatalytic reaction system with a small number of molecules is studied numerically by stochas-
tic particle simulations. A novel state due to ﬂuctuation and discreteness in molecular numbers is
found, characterized as extinction of molecule species alternately in the autocatalytic reaction loop.
Phase transition to this state with the change of the system size and ﬂow is studied, while a single-
molecule switch of the molecule distributions is reported. Relevance of the results to intracellular
processes are brieﬂy discussed.

Cellular activities are supported by biochemical reactions in a cell. To study biochemical dynamic
processes, rate equation for chemical reactions are often adopted for the change of chemical concentra-
tions. However, the number of molecules in a cell is often rather small [1], and it is not trivial if the rate
equation approach based on the continuum limit is always justiﬁed. For example, in cell transduction
even a single molecule can switch the biochemical state of a cell [2]. In our visual system, a single photon
in retina is ampliﬁed to a macroscopic level [3].

Of course, ﬂuctuations due to a ﬁnite number of molecules is discussed by stochastic diﬀerential
equation (SDE) adding a noise term to the rate equation for the concentration [4, 5]. This noise term
sometimes introduces a non-trivial eﬀect, as discussed as noise-induced phase transition [6], noise-induced
order [7], stochastic resonance [8], and so forth. Still, these studies assume that the average dynamics
are governed by the continuum limit, and the noise term is added as a perturbation to it.

In a cell, often the number of some molecules is very small, and may go down very close to or equal to
0. In this case, the change of the number between zero and nonzero, together with the ﬂuctuations may
cause a drastic eﬀect that cannot be treated by SDE. Possibility of some order diﬀerent from macroscopic
dissipative structure is also discussed by Mikhailov and Hess [9, 10] (see also Ref. [11]). Here we present
a simple example with a phenomenon intrinsic to a system with a small number of molecules where both
the ﬂuctuations and digitality(‘0/1’) are essential.

In nonlinear dynamics, drastic eﬀect of a single molecule may be expected if a small change is
ampliﬁed. Indeed, autocatalytic reaction widely seen in a cell, provides a candidate for such ampliﬁcation
[12, 13]. Here we consider the simplest example of autocatalytic reaction networks (loops) with a non-
trivial ﬁnite-number eﬀect. With a cell in mind, we consider reaction of molecules in a container,
contacted with a reservoir of molecules. The autocatalytic reaction loop is Xi + Xi+1 → 2Xi+1; i =
1, · · · , k; Xk+1 ≡ X1
within a container. Through the contact with a reservoir, each molecule Xi diﬀuses in and out.

Assuming that the chemicals are well stirred in the container, our system is characterized by the
number of molecules Ni of the chemical Xi in the container with the volume V . In the continuum limit
with a large number of molecules, the evolution of concentrations xi ≡ Ni/V is represented by

dxi/dt = rixi−1xi − ri+1xixi+1 + Di(si − xi)

(1)

where ri is the reaction rate, Di the diﬀusion constant, and si is the concentration of the molecule in
the reservoir.

For simplicity, we consider the case ri = r, Di = D, and si = s for all i, while the phenomena to
be presented here will persist by dropping this condition. With this homogeneous parameter case, the

1

above equation has a unique attractor, a stable ﬁxed point solution with xi = s. The Jacobi matrix
around this ﬁxed point solution has a complex eigenvalue, and the ﬂuctuations around the ﬁxed point
relax with the frequency ωp ≡ rs/π. In the present paper we mainly discuss the case with k = 4, since
it is the minimal number to see the new phase to be presented.

If the number of molecules is ﬁnite but large, the reaction dynamics can be replaced by Langevin
equation by adding a noise term to eq. (1). In this case, the concentration xi ﬂuctuates around the ﬁxed
point, with the dynamics of a component of the frequency ωp. No remarkable change is observed with
the increase of the noise strength, that corresponds to the decrease of the total number of molecules.

To study if there is a phenomenon that is outside of this SDE approach, we have directly simulated
the above autocatalytic reaction model, by colliding molecules stochastically. Taking randomly a pair
of particles and examining if they can react or not, we have made the reaction with the probability
proportional to r. On the other hand, the diﬀusion out to the reservoir is taken account of by randomly
sampling molecules and probabilistically removing them with in proportion to the diﬀusion constant
D, while the ﬂow to the container is also carried out stochastically in proportion to s, D and V [14].
Technically, we divide time into time interval δt for computation, where one pair for the reaction, and
single molecules for diﬀusion in and out are checked. The state of the container is always updated
when a reaction or a ﬂow of a molecule has occurred. The reaction Xi + Xi+1 → 2Xi+1 is made with
the probability PRi(t, t + δt) ≡ rxi(t)xi+1(t)V δt = rNi(t)Ni+1(t)V −1δt within the step δt. A molecule
diﬀuses out with the probability POi ≡ DV xi(t) = DNi(t), and ﬂows in with PIi ≡ DV s. We choose δt
small enough so that the numerical result is insensitive with the further decrease of δt. By decreasing
V s, we can control the average number of molecules in the container, and discuss the eﬀect of a ﬁnite
number of molecules, since the average of the total number of molecules Ntot is around the order of 4V s
[15]. On the other hand, the ‘discreteness’ in the diﬀusion is clearer as the diﬀusion rate D is decreased.
We set r = 1 and s = 1, without loss of generality (rs/D and sV are the only relevant parameters of the
model by properly scaling the time t).

First, our numerical results agree with those obtained by the corresponding Langevin equation if D
and V are not too small. As the volume V (and accordingly Ntot) is decreased, however, we have found
a new state whose correspondent does not exist in the continuum limit. An example of the time series
is plotted in Fig. 1, where we note a novel state with N1, N3 ≫ 1 and N2, N4 ≈ 0 or N2, N4 ≫ 1 and
N1, N3 ≈ 0. To characterize this state quantitatively, we have measured the probability distribution of
z ≡ x1 + x3 − (x2 + x4). Since the solution of the continuum limit is xi = s(= 1) for all i, this distribution
has a sharp peak around 0, with a Gaussian form approximately, when Ntotis large enough. As shown
in Fig. 2, the distribution starts to have double peaks around ±4, as V is decreased. With the decrease
of V (i.e., Ntot), these double peaks ﬁrst sharpen, and then get broader with the further decrease due to
too large ﬂuctuation of a system with a small number of molecules. Hence the new state with switches
between 1-3 rich and 2-4 rich temporal domains is a characteristic phenomenon that appears only within
some range of a small number of molecules.

The stability of this state is understood as follows. Consider the case with 1-3 rich and N2 = N4 = 0.
When one (or few) X2 molecules ﬂow in, N2 increases, due to the autocatalytic reaction. Then X3 is
ampliﬁed, and since N2 is not large, N2 soon comes back to 0 again. In short, switch from (N1, 0, N3, 0)
to (N1 − ∆, 0, N3 + ∆ + 1, 0) occurs with some ∆, but the 1-3 rich state itself is maintained. In the same
manner, this state is stable against the ﬂow of X4. The 1-3 rich state is maintained unless either N1 or
N3 is close or equal to 0, and both X2 and X4 molecules ﬂow in within the switch time. Hence the 1-3
rich state (as well as 2-4 rich state, of course) is stable as long as the ﬂow rate is small enough.
Within a temporal domain of 1-3 rich state, switches occur to change from (N1, N3) → (N ′

3). In
Fig. 3, we have plotted the probability density for the switch from N1 → N ′
1 when a single X2 molecule
ﬂows in, ampliﬁed, and N2 comes back to 0, by ﬁxing N1 + N3 = Nini at 256 initially. (We assume no
more ﬂow. Hence N ′
3 = Nini + 1). The peak around N ′
1 ≈ N1 + 1 means the reaction from N2
to N3 before the ampliﬁcation, while another peak around N ′
1 ≈ N3 = Nini − N1 shows the conversion
of the numbers through the ampliﬁcation of X2 molecules. Indeed, each temporal domain of the 1-3
rich state consists of successive switches of (N1, N3) →≈ (N3, N1), as shown in Fig. 1. Since molecules
diﬀuse out or in randomly besides this switch, the diﬀerence between N1 and N3 is tended to decrease.
On the other hand, each 1-3 rich state, when formed, has imbalance between N1 and N3, i.e., N1 ≫ N3
or N1 ≪ N3, since, as in Fig. 1, the state is attracted from alternate ampliﬁcation of Xi, where only
one type i of molecules has Ni ≫ 1 and 0 for others. However, the destruction of the 1-3 rich state

is easier if N1 ≫ N3 or N1 ≪ N3, as mentioned. Roughly speaking, each 1-3 rich state starts with a
large imbalance between N1 and N3, and continues over a long time span, if the switch and diﬀusion
lead to N1 ≈ N3, and is destroyed when the large imbalance is restored. Indeed, we have plotted the
distribution of y ≡ x1 − x3 + x2 − x4, to see the imbalance for each 1-3 rich or 2-4 rich domain. This
distribution shows double peaks clearly around y ≈ ±2.8, i.e., (N1, N3) ≈ (3.4V, 0.6V ), (0.6V, 3.4V ).

Let us now discuss the condition to have the 1-3 or 2-4 rich state. First, the total number of molecules
should be small enough so that the ﬂuctuation from the state Ni ≈ Nj (for ∀i, j) may reach the state
with Ni ≈ 0. On the other hand, if the total number is too small, even N1 or N3 for the 1-3 rich state
may approach 0 easily, and the state is easily destabilized. Hence the alternately rich state is stabilized
only within some range of V .

Note also that our system has conserved quantities Pi Ni (and Pi logxi in the continuum limit), if
D is set at 0. Hence, as the diﬀusion constant gets smaller, some characteristics of the initial population
are maintained over long time. Once the above 1-3 (or 2-4) rich state is formed, it is more diﬃcult to be
destabilized if D is small. In Fig. 4, we have plotted the rate of the residence at 1-3 (or 2-4) rich state
over the whole temporal domain, with the change of V . Roughly speaking, the state appears for DV < 1
[16], while for too small V (e.g., V < 4), it is again destabilized by ﬂuctuations. Although the range of
the 1-3 rich state is larger for small D, the necessary time to approach it increases with V . Hence it
would be fair to state that properly small number of molecules is necessary to have the present state.

To sum up, we have discovered a novel state in reaction dynamics intrinsic to a small number of
molecules. This state is characterized by alternately vanishing chemicals within an autocatalytic loop,
and switches by a ﬂow of single molecules. Hence, this state generally appears for a system with an
autocatalytic loop consisting of any even number of elements. With the increase of k, however, the
globally alternating state all over the loop is more diﬃcult to be reached. In this case, locally alternating
states are often formed with the decrease of the system size (e.g., ‘2-4-6-8 rich’ and ‘11-13-15 rich’ states
for k = 16). This local order is more vulnerable to the ﬂow of molecules than the global order for the
k = 4 loop.

On the other hand, for k = 3, two of the chemical species start to vanish for small V , since any pair
of diﬀerent chemical species can react so that one chemical species is quickly absorbed into the other.
This state of single chemical species, however, is not stable by a ﬂow of a single molecule. Indeed, no
clear ‘phase transition’ is observed with the decrease of V .

Although in the present Letter we have studied the case with si = s, we have also conﬁrmed that
the present state with alternately vanishing chemical species is generally stabilized for small V , even if
si or ri or Di are not identical.

Last, we make a remark about the signal transduction in a cell. In a cell, often the number of molecules
is small, and the cellular states often switch by a stimulus of a single molecule [1]. Furthermore, signal
transduction pathways generally include autocatalytic reactions. In this sense, the present stabilization
of the alternately rich state as well as a single-molecule switch may be relevant to cellular dynamics. Of
course, one may wonder that the present mechanism is too ‘stochastic’. Then, use of both the present
mechanism and robustness by dynamical systems [17, 18] may be important.
Indeed, we have made
some preliminary simulations of complex reaction networks. Often, we have found the transition to
a new state at a small number of molecules, when the network includes the autocatalytic loop of 4
chemicals as studied here [19]. Hence the state presented here is not restricted to this speciﬁc reaction
network, but is observed in a class of autocatalytic reaction network. Furthermore switches between
diﬀerent dynamic states (limit cycles or chaos) are possible when the number of some molecules (that
are not directly responsible to the switch) is large enough. The ‘switch of dynamical systems’ by the
present few-number-molecule mechanism will be an important topic to be pursued in future.

[14] One might assume the choice of the diﬀusion ﬂow proportional to DV 2/3, considering the area of
surface. Here we choose the ﬂow proportional to DV , to have a well-deﬁned continuum limit (eq.(1))
for V → ∞. At any rate, by just re-scaling D, the present model can be rewritten into the case with
DV 2/3, for ﬁnite V . Hence the result here is valid for the DV 2/3 (and other) cases.

[15] For small V value, there appears deviation from this estimate. At any rate, the average number

decreases monotonically with V , and for V = 0, it goes to zero.

[16] As shown in Fig. 4, there is a deviation from the scaling by DV . All the data are ﬁt much better

either by D0.9V or by (D + 0.0002)V . At the moment we have no theory which form is justiﬁed.

[19] Stability of the alternately rich state also depends on the network structure, i.e., arrows coming in

and out from the autocatalytic loop of 4 chemicals.

small V.

at continuum limit), it is counted as the 1-3 rich
state (2-4 rich state is deﬁned in the same way)
[20]. The residence rate is computed as the ratio
of the fraction of the time intervals of 1-3 or 2-4
rich state to the whole interval.

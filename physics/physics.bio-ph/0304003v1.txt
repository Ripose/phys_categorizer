Abstract

Environmental signals sensed by nervous systems are often represented
in spike trains carried from sensory neurons to higher neural functions
where decisions and functional actions occur. Information about the en-
vironmental stimulus is contained (encoded) in the train of spikes. We
show how to “read” the encoding using state space methods of nonlin-
ear dynamics. We create a mapping from spike signals which are output
from the neural processing system back to an estimate of the analog in-
put signal. This mapping is realized locally in a reconstructed state space
embodying both the dynamics of the source of the sensory signal and the
dynamics of the neural circuit doing the processing. We explore this idea
using a Hodgkin-Huxley conductance based neuron model and input from
a low dimensional dynamical system, the Lorenz system. We show that
one may accurately learn the dynamical input/output connection and esti-
mate with high precision the details of the input signals from spike timing
output alone. This form of “reading the neural code” has a focus on the
neural circuitry as a dynamical system and emphasizes how one interprets
the dynamical degrees of freedom in the neural circuit as they transform
analog environmental information into spike trains.

1 Introduction

A primary task of nervous systems is the collection at its periphery of informa-
tion from the environment and the distribution of that stimulus input to central
nervous system functions. This is often accomplished through the production
and transmission of action potentials or spike trains [16].

The book [16] and subsequent papers by its authors and their collabora-
tors [2] carefully lay out a program for interpreting the analog stimulus of a
nervous system using ideas from probability theory and information theory, as
well as a representation of the input/output or stimulus/response relation in
terms of Volterra kernel functions. In [16] the authors note that when present-
ing a stimulus to a neuron, it is common “that the response spike train is not
identical on each trial.” Also they observe that “Since there is no unique re-
sponse, the most we can say is that there is some probability of observing each
of the diﬀerent possible responses.” This viewpoint then underlies the wide use

1

of probabilistic ideas in describing how one can “read the neural code” through
interpreting the response spike trains to infer the stimulus.

In this paper we take a diﬀerent point of view and recognize that the neuron
into which one sends a stimulus is itself a dynamical system with a time depen-
dent state which will typically be diﬀerent upon receipt of diﬀerent realizations
of identical stimulus inputs. Viewing the transformation of the stimulus wave-
form into the observed response sequence, as a result of deterministic dynamical
action of the neuron one can attribute the variation in the response to identical
stimuli to diﬀering neuron states when the stimulus arrives. This allows us to
view the entire transduction process of analog input (stimulus) to spike train
output (response) as a deterministic process which can be addressed by methods
developed in nonlinear dynamics for dealing with input/output systems [14].

Previous research on information encoding in spike trains has concentrated
on nonlinear ﬁlters that convert analog input signals into spike trains. It has
been shown that these models can be used to reconstruct the dynamical phase
space of chaotic inputs to the ﬁlters using the spike timing information [17,
4, 9, 10]. Using simple dynamical neuron models, Castro and Sauer [5] have
shown that aspects of a dynamical system can be reconstructed using interspike
intervals (ISIs) properties. Experimental work has demonstrated the ability to
discriminate between chaotic and stochastic inputs to a neuron [15], as well as
showing that decoding sensory information from a spike train through linear
ﬁltering Volterra series techniques can allow for large amounts of information
to be carried by the precise timing of the spikes [16].

We discuss here the formulation of input/output systems from a dynamical
system point of view, primarily summarizing earlier work [14, 1], but with a fo-
cus on recognizing that we may treat the response signals as trains of identical
spikes. Since the modulation of the spike train must be carrying the informa-
tion in the analog input presented to the neuron, if the spike pulse shapes are
identical, all information must be encoded in the ISIs. We shall show that this
is, indeed, the case.

What is the role of information theory in a deterministic chain of actions from
stimulus to spiking response? The ideas of information theory, though often
couched in terms of random variables, applies directly to distributed variation
in dynamical variables such as the output from nonlinear systems. The use of
concepts such as entropy and mutual information, at the basis of information
theoretic descriptions of systems, applies easily and directly to deterministic
systems. The understanding of this connection dates from the 1970’s and 1980’s
where the work of Fraser [6] makes this explicit, and the connection due to
Pesin [11] between positive Lyapunov exponents of a deterministic system and
the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy quantiﬁes the correspondence.

In the body of this paper, we ﬁrst summarize the methods used to determine
a connection between analog input signals and spiking output, then we apply
these methods to a Hodgkin-Huxley conductance based model of the R15 neuron
of Aplysia [3, 12]. Future papers will investigate the use of these methods on
biological signals from the H1 visual neuron of a ﬂy and a stretch receptor in
the tail of a crayﬁsh [20]

2 Input Estimation from State Space Reconstruc-

tion

The general problem we address is the response to stimuli of a neural circuit
with N dynamical variables

x(t) = [x1(t), x2(t), . . . , xN (t)].

When there is no time varying input, x(t) satisﬁes the ordinary diﬀerential
equations

dxa(t)
dt

= Fa(x(t)),

; a = 1, 2, ..., N

The Fa(x) are a set of nonlinear functions which determine the dynamical time
course of the neural circuit. The Fa(x) could well represent a conductance based
neural model of the Hodgkin-Huxley variety as in our example below.

When there is a time dependent external stimulus s(t), these equations be-

come

dxa(t)
dt

= Fa(x(t), s(t)),

and the time course of x(t) in this driven or non-autonomous setting can become
rather more complicated than the case where s(t) = constant.

If we knew the dynamical origin of the signal s(t), then in the combined
space of the stimuli and the neural state space x(t), we would again have an
autonomous system, and many familiar [1] methods for analyzing signals from
nonlinear systems would apply. As we proceed to our “input signal from spike
outputs” connection we imagine that the stimulus system is determined by some
other set of state variables z(t) and that

(1)

(2)

(3)

= G(z(t))

dz(t)
dt
s(t) = h(z(t)),

where G(z) are the nonlinear functions determining the time course of the state
z(t) and h(z(t)) is the nonlinear function determining the input to the neuron
s(t).

With observations of just one component of the state vector x(t), the full
dynamical structure of a system described by Equation 2 can be reconstructed in
a proxy state space [8, 19]. Once the dynamics of the system is reconstructed,
the mapping from state variable to input can be made in the reconstructed
space. Assume the measured state variable, r(t) = g(x(t)), is sampled at times
tj, where j is an integer index. According to the embedding theorem [8, 19],
the dynamics of the system can be reconstructed in an embedding space using
time delayed vectors of the form

y(j) = [r(tj ), r(tj + T τs), . . . , r(tj + (dE − 1)T τs)]
= [r(j), r(j + T ), . . . , r(j + (dE − 1)T )]

(4)

3

where dE is the dimension of the embedding, tj = t0 + jτs, τs is the sampling
time, t0 is an initial time, and T is an integer time delay. If the dimension dE is
large enough these vectors can reconstruct the dynamical structure of the full
system given in Equation 2. Each vector y(j) in the reconstructed phase space
depends on the state of the input signal. Therefore a mapping should exist that
associates locations in the reconstructed phase space y(j) to values of the input
signal s(tj) ≡ s(j) : s(j) = H(y(j)). The map H(y) is the output-to-input
relation we seek.

Without simultaneous measurements of the observable r(t) and the input
signal s(t), this mapping could not be found without knowing the diﬀerential
equations that make up Equation 2. But in a situation where a controlled
stimulus is presented to a neuron while measuring the output, both r(t) and s(t)
are available simultaneously. Such a data set with simultaneous measurements
of spike time and input is split into two parts: the ﬁrst part, called the training
set, will be used to ﬁnd the mapping H(y(j)) between y(j) and s(j). The second
part, called the test set, will be used to test the accuracy of that mapping. State
variable data from the training set r(j) is used to construct time delayed vectors
as given by

y(j) = [r(j), r(j + T ), . . . , r(j + (dE − 1)T )].
Each of these vectors is paired with the value of the stimulus at the midpoint
time of the delay vector

(cid:17)

(6)

We use state space values that occur before and after the input to improve the
quality of the representation. The state variables and input values in the re-
mainder of the data are organized in a similar way and used to test the mapping.
The phase space dynamics near a test data vector are reconstructed using
vectors in the training set that are close to the test vector, where we use Eu-
clidian distance between vectors. These vectors lie close in the reconstructed
phase space, so they will deﬁne the dynamics of the system in that region and
will deﬁne a local map from that region to a input signal value. In other words,
we seek a form for H(y(j)) which is local in reconstructed phase space to y(j).
The global map over all of phase space is a collection of local maps.

The local map is made using the NB nearest neighbors ym(j) , m = 0 . . . NB
of y0(j) = y(j). These nearest neighbor vectors and their corresponding input
values sm(j) are used to ﬁnd a local polynomial mapping between inputs sm(j)
and vector versions of the outputs rm(j), namely ym(j) of the form

sm(j) = H(ym(j)) = M0(j) + M1(j) · ym(j) + M2(j) · ym(j) · ym(j) + · · · , (7)

which assume that the function H(y) is locally smooth in phase space.

The scalar M0(j), the dE-dimensional vector M1(j), and the tensor M2(j)

in dE-dimensions, etc are determined by minimizing the mean squared error

|sm(j) − M0(j) + M1(j) · ym(j) + M2(j) · ym(j) · ym(j) + · · · |2.

(8)

NB

We determine M0(j), M1(j), M2(j), . . . for all j = 1, 2, . . ., and this provides a
local representation of H(y) in all parts of phase space sampled by the training
set y(j), j = 1, 2, . . . , Ntrain.

Once the least squares ﬁt values of M0(j), M1(j), M2(j), . . . are determined
for our training set, we can use the resulting local map to determine estimates of
the input associated with an observed output. This proceeds as follows: select a
new output rnew(l) and form the new output vector ynew(l) as above. Find the
nearest neighbor in the training set to ynew(l). Suppose it is the vector y(q).
Now evaluate an estimated input sest(l) as

sest(l) = M0(q) + M1(q) · ynew(l) + M2(q) · ynew(l) · ynew(l) + · · · .

(9)

This procedure is applied for all new outputs to produce the corresponding
estimated inputs.

3 R15 Neuron Model

To investigate our ability to reconstruct stimuli of analog form presented to
a realistic neuron from the spike train output of that neuron, we examined a
detailed model of the R15 neuron in Aplysia [3, 12], and presented this model
neuron with nonperiodic input from a low dimensional dynamical system. This
model has seven dynamical degrees of freedom. The diﬀerential equations for
this model are

C

dVm(t)
dt

= (gI y2(t)3y3(t) + gT )(VI − V (t)) + gL(VL − V (t))

+ (gKy4(t)4 + gAy5(t)y6(t) + gP y7(t))(VK − V (t))
+ I0 + Iext + Iinput(t),

where the yn(t); n = 2, 3, . . . , 7 satisfy kinetic equations of the form

(10)

(11)

dyn(t)
dt

=

Yn(Vm(t)) − yn(t)
τn(Vm(t))

,

which is the usual form of Hodgkin-Huxley models. The gX , X = I, T, K, A, P, L
are maximal conductances, the VX , X = I, L, K are reversal potentials. Vm(t)
is the membrane potential, C is the membrane capacitance, I0 is a ﬁxed DC
current, and Iext is a DC current we vary to change the state of oscillation of the
model. The functions Yn(V ) and τn(V ) and values for the various constants are
given in [3, 12]. These are phenomenological forms of membrane voltage depen-
dent gating variables, activation and inactivation of membrane ionic channels,
and time constants for these gates. Iinput(t) is a time varying current input to
the neural dynamics. Our goal will be to reconstruct Iinput(t) from observations
of the spike timing in Vm(t).

In Figure 1 we plot the bifurcation diagram of our R15 model. On the vertical
axis we show the values of ISIs taken in the time series for Vm(t) from the model;

5

on the horizontal axis we plot Iext. From this bifurcation plot we see that the
output of the R15 model has regular windows for Iext < .07 then chaotic regions
interspersed with periodic orbits until Iext ≈ 0.19 after which nearly periodic
behavior is seen. The last region represents signiﬁcant depolarization of the
neuron in which tonic periodic ﬁring associated with a stable limit cycle in
phase space is typical of neural activity. Periodic ﬁring leads to a ﬁxed value
for ISIs, which is what we see. Careful inspection of the time series reveals very
small ﬂuctuations in the phase space orbit, but the resolution in Figure 1 does
not expose this.

Other than the characteristic spikes, there are no signiﬁcant features in the
membrane voltage dynamics. In addition all the spikes are essentially the same,
so we expect that all the information about the membrane voltage state is
captured in the times between spikes, namely the interspike intervals: ISIs. The
distribution of ISIs characterizes the output signal for information theoretic
purposes.

We have chosen three values of Iext at which to examine the response of this
neuron model when presented with an input signal. At Iext = 0.1613 we expect
chaotic waveforms expressed as nonperiodic ISIs with a broad distribution. At
Iext = 0.2031 we expect nearly periodic spike trains. And at Iext = −0.15 the
neuron does not spike, the mebrane voltage remains at an equilibrium value.

For each Vm(t) time series we evaluate the normalized distribution of ISIs
which we call PISI (∆) and from this we compute the entropy associated with
the oscillations of the neuron. Entropy is deﬁned as

H(∆) =

Xobserved ∆

−PISI(∆) log

PISI (∆)

(cid:18)

;

(cid:19)

(12)

H(∆) ≥ 0. The entropy is a quantitative measure [18] of the information content
of the output signal from the neural activity.

In Figure 2 we display a section of the Vm(t) time series for Iext = 0.1613.
The irregularity in the spiking times is clear from this ﬁgure and the distribution
PISI (∆) shown in Figure 3. The PISI (∆) was evaluated from collecting 60,000
spikes from the Vm(t) time series and creating a histogram with 15,000 bins.
This distribution has an entropy H(∆) = 12.
In contrast to this we have a
section of the Vm(t) time series for Iext = 0.2031 in Figure 4. Far more regular
ﬁring is observed with a ﬁring frequency much higher than for Iext = 0.1613.
This increase in ﬁring frequency as a neuron is depolarized is familiar. With
Iext = 0.2031 the distribution PISI (∆) is mainly concentrated in one bin with
some small ﬂucuations near that bin. Such a regular distribution leads to a very
low entropy H(∆) = 0.034. If not for the slight variations in ISI, the entropy
would be zero. If PISI (∆0) = 1 for some ISI value ∆0, then H(∆) = 0.

3.1 Input Signals to Model Neuron

In the last section the dynamics of the neuron model were examined using con-
stant input signals. In studying how neurons encode information in their spike

diﬀerent values of Iext.

train, we must clarify what it means for a signal to carry information. In the
context of information theory [18], information lies in the unpredictability of a
signal. If we do not know what a signal is going to do next, then by observing it
we gain new information. Stochastic signals are commonly used as information
carrying signals since their unpredictability is easily characterized and readily
incorporated into the theoretical structure of information theory. But they are
problematic when approaching a problem from a dynamical systems point of
view, since they are systems with a high dimension. This means that the recon-
struction of a stochastic signal using time delay embedding vectors of the form
of Equation 4 would require an extremely large embedding dimension [1]. If we
are injecting stochastic signals into the R15 model, the dimension of the whole
system would increase and cause practical problems in performing the input
reconstruction. Indeed, the degrees of freedom in the stochastic input signal
could well make the input/output relationship we seek to expose impossible to
see.

An attractive input for testing the reconstruction method will have some
unpredictability but have few degrees of freedom.
If there are many degrees
of freedom, the dimensionality of the vector of outputs y(j) above may be

prohibitively large. This leads directly to the consideration of low dimensional
chaotic systems. Chaos originates from local instabilities which cause two points
initially close together in phase space to diverge rapidly as the system evolves
in time, thus producing completely diﬀerent trajectories. This exponential di-
vergence is quantiﬁed by the positive Lyapunov exponents and is the source of
the unpredictability in chaotic systems [1]. The state of any observed system
is known only to some degree of accuracy, limited by measurement and sys-
tematic errors. If the state of a chaotic system were known exactly then the
future state of that system should be exactly predictable. But if the state of a
chaotic system is only known to some ﬁnite accuracy, then predictions into the
future based on the estimated state will diverge from the actual evolution of the
system. Imperfect observations of a chaotic signal will limit the predictability
of the signal. Since chaos can occur in low dimensional systems these signals do
not raise the same concerns as stochastic signals.

We use a familiar example of a chaotic system, the Lorenz attractor [7], as
the input signal to drive the R15 model. This is a well studied system that
exhibits chaotic dynamics and will be used here as input to the R15 neuron
model. The Lorenz attractor is deﬁned by the diﬀerential equations

example times series of the x(t) component of the Lorenz attractor is shown in
Figure 5.

3.2 Numerical Results

An input signal s(t) = Iinput(t) is now formed from the x(t) component of the
Lorenz system. Our goal is to use observations of the stimulus Iinput(t) and
of the ISIs of the output signal Vm(t) to learn the dynamics of the R15 neuron
model in the form of a local map in phase space reconstructed from the observed
ISIs. From this map we will estimate the input Iinput(t) from new observations
of the output ISIs.

Our analog signal input is the x(t) output of the Lorenz system, scaled and

oﬀset to a proper range, and then input to the neuron as an external current

Iinput(t) = Amp(x(t) + x0),

where Amp is the scaling constant and x0 is the oﬀset. The R15 equations are
integrated [13] with this input signal and the spike times tj from the membrane
voltage are recorded simultaneously with the value of the input current at that
time Iinput(tj ). Reconstruction of the neuron plus input phase space is done by
creating time delay vectors from the ISIs

We used the same three values of Iext -0.15, 0.1613, and 0.2031 employed
above in our simulations. We took Amp = 0.001, κ = 104, and x0 = 43.5
for all simulations unless stated otherwise. This very small amplitude of the
input current is much more of a challenge for the input reconstruction than
large amplitudes. When Amp is large, the neural activity is entrained by the
input signal and ‘recovering’ the input merely requires looking at the output
and scaling it by a constant. Further, the intrinsic spiking of the neuron which
is its important biological feature goes away when Amp is large. The large value
of κ assures that the spikes sample the analog signal Iinput(t) very well.

For Iext = 0.1613 we show a selection of both the input current Iinput and the
output membrane voltage Vm(t) time series in Figure 6. The injected current
substantially changes the pattern of ﬁring seen for the autonomous neuron. Note
that the size of the input current is numerically about 10−3 of Vm(t), yet the
modulation of the ISIs due to this small input is clearly visible in Figure 6.

Using the ISIs of this time series we evaluated PISI (∆) as discussed above
and from that the entropy H(∆) associated with the driven neuron. The ISI
distribution, PISI (∆), shown in Figure 7, has an entropy H(∆) = 8.16. The

and κ = 104. Note the diﬀerent scales for Iinput (shown on the left axis) and
Vm(t). (shown on the right axis)

eﬀect of the input current has been to substantially narrow the range of ISIs
seen in Vm(t). This can be seen by comparison with Figure 3.

Figure 8 shows an example of input signal reconstruction which estimates
Iinput using ISI vectors of the described in Equation 15. We used a time delay
T = 1, an embedding dimension dE = 7, and a local linear map for H(y(j)). The
RMS error over the 10,000 reconstructed values of the input was σ = 4.6 · 10−4.
The input signal is only reconstructed at times at which the neuron spikes. So
each point is the reconstruction curve in Figure 8 corresponds to a spike in
Vm(t). Some features of the input are missed because no spikes occur during
that time, but otherwise the reconstruction is very accurate. At places where
the spike rate is high, interpolation seems to ﬁll the gaps between spikes.

Diﬀerent values of embedding dimension, time delay, and map order will
lead to diﬀerent reconstruction errors. For example, low embedding dimension
may not unfold the dynamics and linear maps may not be able to ﬁt some
neighborhoods to the input. For the results shown here, there is little diﬀerence
in the RMS reconstruction error if the embedding dimension is increased or
quadratic maps are used instead of linear maps. This may not be true if lower
embedding dimension is used.

a chaotic signal. With Iext = 0.2031 the neuron is in a periodic spiking regime
and the input modulates the instantaneous ﬁring rate of the neuron. A sample of
the input current and membrane voltage is shown in Figure 9. The distribution
of ISIs, PISI (∆), shown in Figure 10 and has an entropy H(∆) = 9.5. The
eﬀect of the input current is to substantially broaden the range of ISIs and
increase its entropy as compared to the nearly periodic ﬁring of the autonomous
neuron with Iext = 0.2031. The high spiking rate and close relationship between
input current amplitude and ISI lead to very accurate reconstructions using low
dimensional embeddings. A sample of the reconstruction using dE = 2 and
T = 1 is shown in Figure 11. The RMS reconstruction error of σ = 6.1 · 10−4
with a maximum error of 0.007.

In a ﬁnal example we show the reconstruction when the neuron is being
driven with an input current below the threshold for spikes. With Iext = −0.15,
the autonomous R15 neuron will remain at an equilibrium level and not pro-
duce spikes. A Lorenz input injected into the neuron with Amp = 0.002 and
x0 = 43.5 is large enough to cause the neuron to spike. Figure 12 shows a
sample of the membrane voltage time series along with the corresponding input
current. Since the spiking rate of the neuron is much lower than before, κ is
increased to 2 · 105. This slows down the dynamics of the Lorenz input relative
to the neuron dynamics. Spikes occur during increasing portions of the input

current and are absent for low values of input current. Figure 13 shows the
distribution of ISIs which has an entropy H(∆) = 5.3. The low spiking rate
shows up in the distribution in the form large numbers of long ISI. For the re-
construction of the input larger embedding dimensions were needed. An sample
of the reconstruction is shown in Figure 14 using dE = 7 and T = 1. For this ﬁt
the RMS reconstruction error σ = 0.0094 with a maximum error of 0.03. These
errors are noticeably higher than the previous two examples.

The accuracy of the reconstruction method depends on a high spiking rate
in the neuron relative to the time scale of the input signal, since only one
reconstructed input value is generated for each spike. If the spiking rate of the
neuron is low relative to the time scales of the input signal, then the neuron will
undersample the input signal and miss many of its features. This limitation can
be demonstrated by decreasing the time scale parameter κ, thereby speeding
up the dynamics of the input. During the longer ISIs the input current can
change by large amounts. Though the reconstruction undersamples the input,
but interpolation can ﬁll in some of the gaps. As κ is increased further the
reconstruction will further degrade.

4 Discussion

In previous research on the encoding of chaotic attractors in spikes trains, the
spike trains were produced by nonlinear transformations of chaotic input sig-
nals. Threshold crossing neuron models have been used, which generate the
spike times at upward crossings of a threshold. This is equivalent to a Poincare
section of the input signal. Also integrate and ﬁre neurons have been studied,
which integrate the input signal and ﬁre a spike when it crosses a threshold, after
which the integral is reset to zero. Both of these models have no intrinsic com-
plex dynamics; they can not produce entropy autonomously. All of the complex
behavior is in the input signal. Even though the attractor of a chaotic input can
be reconstructed from the ISIs, these models do not account for the complex
behavior of real neurons. The input reconstruction method we have presented
here allows for complex intrinsic dynamics of the neuron. We have shown that
the local polynomial representations of input/output relations realized in recon-
structed phase space can extract the chaotic input from the complex interaction
between the input signal and neuron dynamics.

Other experimental works have used linear kernels to map the spike train
into the input. They have shown that the precise timing of individual spikes can
encode a lot of information about the input [16]. And the precise relative tim-

ing between two spikes can carry even more information than their individual
timings combined [2]. These results may be pointing toward a state space rep-
resentation since the time delay embedding vectors used here take into account
both the precise spike timing and the recent history of ISIs. From a dynamical
systems perspective this is important because the state of the system at the
time of the input will aﬀect its response. This is a factor that linear kernels do
not take into account.

The advantage of using local representations of input/output relations in
reconstructed state space lies primarily in the insight it may provide about
the underlying dynamics of the neural transformation process mapping analog
environmental signals into spike trains. The goal of the work presented here is
not primarily to show we can accurately recover analog input signals from the
ISIs of spike output from neurons, though that is important to demonstrate. The
main goal is to provide clues on how one can now model the neural circuitry
which transforms these analog signals. The main piece of information in the
work presented here lies in the size of the reconstructed space dE which tells
us something about the required dimension of the neural circuit. Here we see
that a low dimension can give excellent results indicating that the complexity of
the neural circuit is not fully utilized in the transformation to spikes. Another
suggestion of this is in the entropy of the input and output signals. In the case

Figure 11: ISI Reconstruction of the input Lorenz signal to an R15 neuron. The
solid line is the actual input to the neuron. The dots joined by dashed lines are
the ISI reconstructions. The embedding dimension of the reconstruction dE is
2, the time delay T is 1, Iext = 0.2031, κ is 104, and a linear map was used.
The RMS error of the estimates over 10,000 estimations is σ = 6.1 · 10−4 and
the maximum error is about 0.007.

where Iext = 0.1613 the entropy of the analog input is 11.8 while the entropy of
the ISI distribution of the output is 8.16. When Iext = 0.2031 the output entropy
is 9.5. This suggests, especially in the case of the larger current, that the signal
into R15 neuron model acts primarily as a modulation on the ISI distribution.
This modulation may be substantial, as in the case when Iext = 0.1613 but
reading the modulated signal does not require complex methods.

Our ﬁnal example took Iext = −0.15 at which value the undriven neuron has
Vm(t) = constant, so it is below threhold for production of action potentials. In
this case the introduction of the stimulus drove the neuron above this threshold
and produced a spike train which could be accurately reconstructed. This ex-
ample is relevant to the behavior of biological neurons which act as sensors for
various quantities: visiual stimuli, chemical stimuli (olfaction), etc. In the study
of biological sensory systems [20] the neural circuitry is quiet in the absence of
input signals, yet as we now see the methods are equally valid and accurate.

Abstract. Helicases are molecular motors which unwind double-stranded nucleic acids (dsNA) in cells.
Many helicases move with directional bias on single-stranded (ss) nucleic acids, and couple their directional
translocation to strand separation. A model of the coupling between translocation and unwinding uses an
interaction potential to represent passive and active helicase mechanisms. A passive helicase must wait
for thermal ﬂuctuations to open dsNA base pairs before it can advance and inhibit NA closing. An active
helicase directly destabilizes dsNA base pairs, accelerating the opening rate. Here we extend this model to
include helicase unbinding from the nucleic-acid strand. The helicase processivity depends on the form of
the interaction potential. A passive helicase has a mean attachment time which does not change between
ss translocation and ds unwinding, while an active helicase in general shows a decrease in attachment time
during unwinding relative to ss translocation. In addition, we describe how helicase unwinding velocity and
processivity vary if the base-pair binding free energy is changed.

1. Introduction

Helicases are motor proteins which separate the two strands of helical double-stranded nucleic acids (NA).
Both DNA, RNA, and DNA-RNA hybrid helicases are found in cells. Strand separation requires breaking
the base-pairing interactions between the two strands and therefore requires energy input. Unwinding is
fueled by NTP hydrolysis, typically of ATP. Helicases play a role in nearly every cellular process which
involves NA, including DNA replication and repair, recombination, transcription, translation, and RNA
processing[1]. Aberrant functioning of helicases is associated with genome instability (the accumulation of
damage and errors in the genome), premature aging, and cancer[2].

The essential common feature of all helicases is their ability to move along NA strands and couple motion
to strand separation. (We use the terms opening, strand separation, and unwinding interchangeably.) For
this reason, helicases are also NA translocases and share some features with other proteins which move on
NA strands[3, 4].

The unwinding velocity and processivity of helicases are important for helicase function. The unwinding
velocities of helicases range from tens to thousands of base pairs per second[1]. Helicase processivity is also
variable. Processivity is most often deﬁned as the average number of base pairs unwound per helicase binding
event. Measured values of helicase processivity range from tens to tens of thousands of base pairs[1]. The
processivity can be signiﬁcantly altered by accessory proteins[5, 6, 7], polymerases[8] and multiple copies
of the same helicase[9, 10, 11]. Attachment of an enzyme either to a surface or another protein tends to
increase the processivity[12]. In single-molecule experiments on RecBCD helicase, a lower processivity was
measured for a helicase that was free in solution[13] than for a helicase attached to the surface[14]. The
velocity and processivity of helicase proteins are thought to be related to their biological roles. For example,
replicative helicases are responsible for unwinding all cellular DNA during DNA replication. It has been
proposed that replicative helicases should therefore have a high velocity and processivity, so that a small
number of helicases can eﬃciently function in DNA copying. By contrast, a helicase which functions in DNA
damage repair may only need to unwind a small region of DNA near a damage site; therefore its velocity

and processivity may be low. Understanding the physical basis of the velocity and processivity will help
illuminate how these proteins may be optimized for diﬀerent cellular roles.

Diﬀerent deﬁnitions of processivity have been given in the literature. They include (i) the average
time a motor stays attached to its track, (ii) the average number of steps a motor travels before detaching,
(iii) the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed before the motor falls oﬀ the track, and (iv ) the probability
that a motor takes one more step (as opposed to unbinding before the next step). For helicases and other
motors which interact with obstacles, this picture is complicated. We may consider both the translocation
processivity, which is the average number of forward steps taken by the helicase taken during one binding
event, and the unwinding processivity, which is the average number of NA base pairs (bp) unwound during
a helicase binding event. The translocation and unwinding processivity are not equivalent, and their values
vary with initial conditions. Unwinding processivity is usually measured for helicases; however, the measured
value can depend on where the motor binds relative to where it begins unwinding the NA.

Because helicase proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, many diﬀerent types of
helicase protein are found in cells. Even the relatively simple bacterium E. coli has at least 11 diﬀerent
types of helicase. Helicases are structurally diverse, and not all helicases share a common mechanism.
However, many helicases share the ability to translocate directionally on single-stranded (ss) NA, especially
members of superfamilies I and II[4]. Motion on ssNA is analogous to the motion of a classical motor protein
which moves with directional bias on an inﬁnite, one-dimensional lattice (ﬁgure 1). Single-stranded NA is
polar, with one end labeled the 3′ end and the other the 5′ end. Helicases which directionally translocate on
ssNA are referred to as 3′ → 5′ helicases or 5′ → 3′ helicases, depending on which direction they move on
the single strand. When the helicase is near the ss-double strand (ds) junction, the helicase can move the
junction forward, creating additional ssNA “track” as it moves.

A natural question in the study of helicases is how a protein may eﬃciently couple translocation to
unwinding. In the biochemical literature on helicases, this coupling is classiﬁed as passive or active[15, 1, 3, 4].
A passive helicase waits for a thermal ﬂuctuation that opens part of the dsNA, and then moves forward,
binds to the newly available ssNA, and prevents the NA from closing. An active helicase directly destabilizes
the dsNA, presumably by changing the free energy of the ds state.

Many diﬀerent types of helicase have been studied experimentally in some detail[1, 3, 16]. In recent
years, single-molecule experiments have been performed for several helicases, directly measuring helicase
unwinding rates. The helicase RecBCD, which is also an exonuclease (it degrades one of the unwound
strands as it moves) has been studied by several groups[17, 13, 18, 14, 19]. Interpretation of the RecBCD
data is complicated by the fact that RecBCD contains two helicases of opposite polarity, which move on
both strands of the DNA[20, 21, 22]. Bulk kinetic experiments on RecBCD have tried to determine the
kinetic step size by ﬁtting the data to a model of helicase unwinding[23, 24, 25, 26]; to date physical steps of
this helicase have not been directly observed. Single-strand translocation and double-strand unwinding were
observed for Rep helicase using single-molecule FRET[27, 28]. The motion of the RNA helicase DbpA has
been observed with AFM[29]. Single-molecule experiments on UvrD helicase have observed unwinding, and
evidence of strand-switching[30]. Finally, single-molecule FRET has been used to study the T4 replisome,

the replication machinery which includes the T4 helicase[31].

Although extensive biochemical and structural studies of helicases have been performed, few descriptions
of the physics of helicase unwinding exist. Previous work includes a “ﬂashing ﬁeld” model speciﬁc to
hexameric ring helicases[32], a description of a helicase as a biased random walk, which considered how
the density of histones aﬀects the random walk[33], and a model where helicase motion is represented as a
propagating front[34, 35]. Molecular dynamics simulations have addressed properties of PcrA helicase[36].
Recent work includes a proposal that HCV helicase functions by a ratchet mechanism[37], a theory for
two coupled motor proteins, proposed to describe RecBCD helicase[38], and a detailed description of the
mechanochemistry of T7 helicase[39]. A physical description of helicase unwinding of NA has been proposed
which contains both active and passive opening as diﬀerent cases in a general framework[40, 41]. Here we
extend the description of helicase unwinding to allow calculation of helicase processivity.

We represent a helicase by a particle which moves with directional bias on a one-dimensional lattice
(corresponding to the ssNA). The ss-ds junction represents an obstacle on the lattice which blocks the helicase
motion while also moving due to thermal ﬂuctuations. Our model describes diﬀerent forms of the interaction
between the particle and the mobile obstacle. This scenario—a moving particle which interacts with an
obstacle—also exists in other biological systems. Peskin, Odell, and Oster introduced the “polymerization
ratchet” to describe how a growing biological polymer can exert a force against a ﬂuctuating obstacle[42].
They argued that the rate of polymerization is limited by the time required for the obstacle to diﬀuse one
monomer size.
In the language of our model, described below, this scenario corresponds to a hard-wall
interaction potential between the growing tip and the obstacle. As we show here, other forms of interaction
can show signiﬁcantly diﬀerent velocity and processivity. Another example of the interaction of a motor
with a second degree of freedom is the kinesin-family motor protein MCAK, which induces microtubule
depolymerization if it interacts with the microtubule end[43, 44, 45]. This process is relevant in the generation
of force during the separation of chromosomes by the mitotic spindle. Finally, the interaction of two motor
proteins on a ﬁlament is another example for which our approach is relevant.

In this paper, we ﬁrst review a simple description which captures both active and passive unwinding by
helicases[40, 41]. This framework considers a single helicase which does not unbind from the NA strand, and
permits us to calculate the unwinding velocity for a given interaction potential (section 2). The unwinding
velocity for a passive helicase with hard-wall interaction potential is typically signiﬁcantly slower than the ss
translocation rate of the motor far from the ss-ds junction. For a simple form of active opening, the velocity
approaches the single-strand translocation rate of the motor. In other words, an optimized active helicase
can unwind NA as fast as it translocates on ssNA. Comparable rates of ss translocation and unwinding is
therefore a signature of active opening.

We then extend this description to include a nonzero unbinding rate, and develop a simple model of
unbinding that captures the key eﬀects. We assume that the unbinding rate may be diﬀerent for a helicase
translocating on ssNA than for a helicase unwinding dsNA, because the interaction potential alters the
unbinding rate when the helicase is near the ss-ds junction. If the interaction free energy is larger, than
the helicase will unbind more quickly. In particular, we assume that the free energy diﬀerence between the
bound state and the barrier to unbinding is decreased by the amount of the interaction potential. We assume
that the unbinding rate is independent of the helicase biochemical state. The unbinding rate is determined
only by the height of the energy barrier separating the bound from the unbound states.

This model of unbinding allows us to calculate diﬀerent measures of processivity (section 3). We discuss
the dependence of the processivity on the shape of the interaction potential. The average attachment time of
a helicase is particularly simple for a passive helicase: the helicase unbinding rate during unwinding is equal
to the unbinding rate during ss translocation (section 3.2). By contrast, the helicase attachment time is lower
during unwinding than during ss translocation for an active helicase (section 4). Decreased attachment time
during unwinding is a signature of active unwinding.

Finally, in our conclusion, we discuss the connection between our results and experiments (section 5).

2. Active and passive unwinding

In our simpliﬁed discrete description of helicase unwinding, the position of the motor—the helicase—along
its track is labeled by the integer n, and the position of the obstacle—the ss-ds junction—is denoted m
(ﬁgure 1). The motor is assumed to move toward increasing n, and we expect n ≤ m. The interaction
between motor and obstacle is characterized by an interaction energy U (m − n) which depends only on the
obstacle-motor separation. We assume U → 0 for m ≫ n and U → ∞ for m < n.

One simple form of this potential is a hard-wall interaction of zero range: U = 0 for m > n and U = ∞
for m ≤ n. For a hard-wall potential, a motor which is near the obstacle (n = m − 1) can advance only if
the obstacle undergoes a ﬂuctuation which increases m. This situation corresponds to passive unwinding.
For active unwinding, the interaction between the motor and obstacle has nonzero range: when the helicase
is near the ss-ds junction, both the kinetics of NA opening and the helicase motion are altered by the
interaction. We will discuss interaction potentials which represent active unwinding below.

We denote the rates of forward and backward hopping of the motor on the lattice far from the obstacle
by k+ and k−. The hopping rates for forward and backward motion of the junction (corresponding to the
opening and closing of dsNA) in the absence of the helicase are denoted α and β. The ratio of these rates is
given by α/β = e−∆G where ∆G is the free energy diﬀerence per base between dsNA and two complementary
ssNA strands. (Note that we use units where kBT = 1.) This energy diﬀerence is positive when dsNA is
thermodynamically stable. For simplicity, we write a similar expression for the ratio of forward and backward
hopping rates of the helicase, k+/k− = e∆µ. Here ∆µ denotes the chemical free energy of ATP hydrolysis
which drives helicase motion. This expression applies when each hydrolysis event is tightly coupled to a
forward step on the NA. We use this simpliﬁcation here to discuss principles which do not depend on the
validity of this assumption. Note that an eﬀective value of ∆µ can be derived in certain limits from a more
detailed description of the mechanochemical coupling[41].

The interaction between the helicase and the ss-ds junction modiﬁes the hopping rates. We express the

ratios of these rates as

where the parameter f describes the energy barrier of the transitions. For a one-dimensional reaction, f
corresponds to the fractional distance of the peak of the barrier between the two adjacent states and thus
0 < f < 1.

For the simple case of a hard-wall potential (ﬁgure 2a), the helicase prevents NA closing when j = 1.
Therefore β1 = 0 because U (0) is inﬁnite. Inﬁnite U (0) also implies k+
1 = 0: the helicase must wait until a
thermal ﬂuctuation opens the NA before advancing. An interaction potential with nonzero range corresponds
to enzymatically assisted opening. For simplicity, we use a linear potential with range N and slope Uo. The
discretized potential is shown in ﬁgures 2b and 2c. The potential energy increases in N steps, each of energy
U0, before a hard wall is reached. The increase in energy due to this potential facilitates opening of the
dsNA: U (j − 1) > U (j) implies βj/αj−1 < β/α. In addition, the interaction energy slows helicase forward
motion. We assume U → 0 for j → ∞, so that no interaction occurs for large separations.

This expression for v has a simple physical interpretation—the quantity in parentheses is the unwinding
rate at separation j, which is multiplied by the probability Pj of ﬁnding the complex at separation j. The
eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient which characterizes velocity ﬂuctuations is

We assume that the helicase remains bound to the NA for all time. Therefore the expressions for v and D
are true steady-state values reached by a real system in the long-time limit. In the results below, unwinding
velocities of a bound helicase are calculated under this steady-state assumption.

3. Processive and unprocessive unwinding

In section 2 we assumed that the motor never unbinds from the track, so the model represents a motor
which is inﬁnitely processive. Real motors have ﬁnite processivity—they unbind eventually. This eﬀect can
be incorporated in our description by introducing the rate of unbinding γ. We assume that γ depends on
the separation j between motor and obstacle, but has no other position or time dependence. For a repulsive
potential such as the linear potential discussed above, when the motor and obstacle are close to each other
the free energy of motor and junction is increased. This typically leads to an increased rate of unbinding.
This eﬀect can be described by writing[46]
γj = γeU(j).

(7)

Here γ > 0 is the detachment rate for motion on a single strand far from the junction.

The time evolution of the probability distribution is then described by

Note that this expression diﬀers from equation (3) only in the additional term proportional to the unbinding
rate γj. The other rates are unchanged as deﬁned above, in equation (2). We assume that at time t = 0,
the helicase and junction have a speciﬁc position determined by j = jo and l = lo. Therefore,

P (j, l, t = 0) = δjjo δllo ,

where δjk = 1 for j = k and 0 otherwise.

3.1. Processivity and attachment time

We characterize the processivity by the average attachment time hτ i of the motor and by both the
translocation processivity hδni, which is the average number of forward steps taken by the helicase during one
binding event, and the unwinding processivity hδmi, which is the average number of NA bp unwound during
one helicase binding event. These measures of processivity depend on initial conditions. If the helicase binds
near the ss-ds junction, then the translocation and unwinding processivities are similar. However, if the
helicase binds to a ss region far from the junction, then the unwinding processivity can be much smaller
than the translocation processivity. If the NA can close on average under these conditions, the corresponding
unwinding processivity becomes negative.

The mean attachment time is deﬁned as

The translocation processivity hδni = hn − noi is the mean number of steps the motor takes in one direction

The solutions to equation (28) depend on the shape of the interaction potential. Some examples are
discussed below. However, in general equation (29) can be solved formally. Equation (29) is a second-order,
linear, inhomogeneous diﬀerence equation. Since we have assumed translational invariance in l, the resulting
solution is independent of lo. Therefore we choose lo = 0 for convenience. The solutions have the form
Tl = yl for l 6= 0. Using this ansatz, y obeys a quadratic equation

y2 − (1 + a)y + (a − b) = 0,

where a = (1 + p)/q and b = 1/q. We denote by y+ and y− the positive and negative roots of equation (35).
For l ≥ 0, Tl = A′yl
+, since Tl must vanish for l → ±∞. Requiring
that T0 is the same for both expressions implies A = A′. Finally, equation (29) for l = 0 leads to

easily be obtained.

sectionVelocity and processivity for a hard-wall interaction potential

3.3. Velocity

For the hard-wall potential, the unwinding velocity is given by
αk+ − βk−
β + k+

vHW =

The velocity is positive whenever k+/k− > β/α, that is, the free energy change ∆G which drives NA
closing must be smaller than the chemical potential ∆µ of ATP hydrolysis. The maximum vHW occurs for
a unidirectional helicase (k− = 0). This upper bound is

where the approximation holds if k+ ≪ β. Thus a passive helicase unwinds more slowly than it translocates
on ssNA by a factor ≈ α/β. This result has a simple interpretation: the base pair adjacent to the helicase
has a probability α/β of being open. Thus, when the helicase attempts a forward hop it succeeds with
probability α/β.

Figure 3. The translocation processivity hδni and unwinding processivity hδmi as a function of the initial
separation jo between motor and junction. When jo = 1, the translocation and unwinding processivities are
approximately equal. As the separation jo increases, the translocation processivity hδni is approximately
constant, while the unwinding processivity hδmi decreases. The parameters are α = 105 s−1, β = 7 × 105
s−1, k+ = 1 base s−1, k− = 0.01 base s−1, γ = 0.03 s−1. Calculations were done numerically using a grid
size of M = 100 in j.

3.4. Processivity

For a hard-wall potential, the average attachment time, translocation processivity, and unwinding
processivity can be calculated analytically. We solve equation (28) for Rj for the simple case jo = 1.
For j > 1, the rates are independent of j and we have

Rj+1 = (1 + d)Rj + (d − e)Rj−1,

(42)

where we have deﬁned

d =

e =

α + k− + γ
β + k+ ,
γ
β + k+ .
This equation has solutions of the form Rj = xj
±, where the x± are the positive and negative root of the
quadratic equation x2 − (1 + d)x + (e − d) = 0. The boundary condition that Rj vanishes for large j imposes
Rj = Bxj

−. From equation (28) at j = 1, we ﬁnd (β + k+)(R2 − dR1) = 1 and
−1.

B = [x−(β + k+)(d − x−)]

(45)
With these expressions, hτ i = γ−1. This simple result follows since for the hard wall case γj = γ is
independent of the separation j.

(44)

(43)

The average change in j is

(47)

(48)

The quantity hδli now follows from equation (39). In the hard-wall case, the translocation processivity is
approximately the unwinding velocity times the attachment time: hδmi ≈ vhτ i, as we would expect for
position-independent detachment. Note that the this result depends on initial conditions and is valid for
jo = 1.

When jo = 1, the translocation and unwinding processivities are approximately equal. As the separation
between the motor and obstacle increases, the unwinding processivity drops. A negative unwinding

We varied the opening rate of the ss-ds junction, assuming that the closing rate is constant. Therefore

γ = 0.01 s−1, and jo = 1.

processivity reﬂects net backwards motion of the obstacle while the motor is bound. For a large separation
between the motor and obstacle, they have no eﬀect on each other. In ﬁgure 3, the processivities are shown
as a function of jo with other parameters ﬁxed.

The helicase adjacent to the junction can only move when the junction opens. Therefore, the velocity
and the processivities depend strongly on the base pair binding free energy ∆G. The velocity and the
measures of processivity are displayed in ﬁgure 4 as a function of ∆G. In this calculation, we assume that
β is constant and α = βe−∆G. The value ∆G = 2 corresponds to the sequenced-average value for typical
genomic DNA. For small ∆G, the processivity increases dramatically, because the binding energy driving
NA closing is decreased.

4. Velocity and processivity of an active helicase

4.1. Velocity

Active opening can be represented by an interaction potential with nonzero range between junction and
helicase. For simplicity, we choose linear potentials characterized by a range of N steps and a step height Uo
(ﬁgure 2). The repulsive interaction between helicase and junction implies that for small separation j within
the range of the potential the rates of junction opening and helicase backward hopping are increased. The
unwinding velocity for such a potential, relative to the hard-wall case, is [40, 41]

vN
vHW

=

cN (e−Uo − c) + (1 − c)e−f Uo(e−N Uo − cN )
cN (e−Uo − c) + (1 − c)e−Uo (e−N Uo − cN )

.

(49)

Note that the helicase cannot increase the unwinding rate beyond a certain limit. Assuming 0 < f < 1, the
unwinding rate has an upper bound vN ≤ c−1vHW .

The unwinding velocity for one step (N = 1) is displayed in ﬁgure 5a as a function of the step height
Uo for diﬀerent values of the parameter f . For small U0, the unwinding rate increases with increasing step
height Uo because the presence of the step facilitates NA opening. For large step heights, the unwinding
rate decreases, because the repulsive potential reduces the rate of helicase forward motion. The unwinding
velocity for diﬀerent values of N is shown in ﬁgure 6a as a function of Uo. For increasing N , the opening
rate becomes more sensitive to Uo and the maximum occurs at higher values. For large N , the maximum
unwinding rate occurs for U∗ ≈ − ln c ≈ ∆G. In this case fastest unwinding occurs when the slope of the
potential matches the base-pairing energy of the NA.

M = 100.

4.2. Processivity for active unwinding

Active unwinding results in a decrease of the mean attachment time, as compared to ss translocation or
passive opening for which hτ i = γ−1. This is a consequence of the repulsive interaction potential which leads
to increased unbinding rates for small j. The dependence of the average attachment time on the step height
is displayed in ﬁgure 5b for N = 1. For a potential with one step, hτ i decreases rapidly with step height to a
plateau value ≈ 0.2γ−1. This decrease is independent of f , since the unbinding rate does not depend on the
barrier between states of diﬀerent j. Note that the limits Uo → 0 and Uo → ∞ do not give the same result
for the processivity because the initial conditions are diﬀerent: Uo → 0 corresponds to a hard-wall potential
with jo = 1, while Uo → ∞ corresponds to a hard-wall potential but with jo = 0.

The decrease of hτ i for increasing Uo is similar but even more pronounced for potentials with longer
range, as shown in ﬁgure 6b. For N ≥ 2, the average attachment time rapidly decreases to < 0.01γ−1.
Decreased attachment time during unwinding (as compared to ss translocation) is a strong signature of
active unwinding.

Because the attachment time decreases with increasing step height, the translocation and unwinding
processivities also tend to decrease. However, for a one-step potential hδni and hδmi decrease slowly for
increasing step height when f is small (ﬁgure 5c). This occurs because the rapid increase in the velocity
approximately cancels the decrease in attachment time, leading to a processivity that is relatively insensitive
to step height. For larger numbers of steps, a decrease in hδmi occurs as Uo increases (ﬁgure 6c). These
curves are approximately exponentially decreasing functions, with a decay constant determined by f . Small
f means that the processivity varies slowly in the biologically plausible range between 0 − 20 kBT . Note
that above Uo = 20, little or no increase in the velocity can be achieved by increasing the step size.

4.3. Dependence on base-pair binding energy

The velocity and attachment time are sensitive to the mean free energy per base pair ∆G. We assume that
the rate β is constant and α = βe−∆G. For simplicity, we show results only for a potential with N = 1. The
dependence of v and hτ i on ∆G depends on the step height Uo. For a hard-wall potential, the velocity varies
exponentially as a function of ∆G. As Uo increases, the velocity becomes less sensitive to ∆G (ﬁgure 7a).
Thus for Uo = 5 the displayed curve decreases slowly with increasing ∆G. The attachment time hτ i shows
the opposite trend: for a hard-wall interaction potential, the attachment time is independent of ∆G. The
attachment time is also weakly dependent on ∆G for small Uo, while for larger Uo, hτ i varies more rapidly
(ﬁgure 7b). The processivity hδmi as a function of ∆G exhibits the same behavior independent of Uo (ﬁgure
7c), because the variation in velocity and attachment time as a function of step height approximately cancel.
Therefore, measurements of velocity and attachment time have greater power to elucidate aspects of the
potential.

5. Discussion

In this paper, we have extended a model for the unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids by helicases to
allow calculation of helicase processivity. An interaction potential describes how the helicase and NA ss-ds
junction aﬀect each other. We assume that the local unbinding rate of the helicase depends exponentially
on the interaction potential. The mean attachment time, the translocation processivity, and the unwinding
processivity depend on initial conditions: if the position where the helicase binds to the ssNA is varied, the
processivity changes. Therefore, in diﬀerent experimental situations diﬀerent values of the processivity could
be obtained.

A hard-wall interaction potential describes passive unwinding. In this case, the unwinding velocity vHW
is signiﬁcantly slower than the single-strand translocation rate of the motor far from the ss-ds junction. The
average attachment time for the hard-wall potential is hτ i = γ−1 since the unbinding rate γ is independent
of position. In other words, the mean attachment time of a passive helicase is the same whether the helicase
translocates on ssNA or unwinds dsNA. For initial conditions where the helicase and junction are adjacent to
each other, hδmi ≈ vHW hτ i—the translocation processivity is approximately the unwinding velocity times
the attachment time. The translocation processivity is lower for a passive helicase during unwinding (relative
to ss translocation); this decrease occurs solely because of the decrease in velocity of the helicase, while the
average attachment time is unchanged.

We represent active unwinding by a linearly increasing potential of ﬁnite range, characterized by the
step height U0 and the number of steps N . A range of up to 10 bases is motivated by the typical size of a
helicase monomer. Indeed, structures determined by X-ray diﬀraction suggest that a helicase can interact
with 5-10 bases in the ds region of the ss-ds junction [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. We ﬁnd that for an active
helicase the unwinding velocity can approach the single-strand translocation rate of the motor. In other

12

words, the helicase can unwind as fast as it translocates on ssNA.

In contrast to the passive case, the attachment time of an active helicase is shorter during unwinding
than during ss translocation. Decreased attachment time during unwinding is a general property of actively
opening helicases in our model. Our representation of the unbinding rate assumes that the helicase is
bound in a single potential well with a barrier separating the bound state from the unbound state. This
model is an approximation, because the helicase exists in diﬀerent biochemical states throughout the ATP
hydrolysis cycle. Each state might experience a diﬀerent free-energy barrier to unbinding. In principle, if
the relative time spent in each of these states changes (for example, as the ATP concentration is varied),
the unbinding rate might vary as well. However, experimental evidence suggests that our simpliﬁed model
is a good approximation. Single-molecule measurements on RecBCD[13] and UvrD[30] ﬁnd that the average
attachment times of these helicases are independent of ATP concentration. Therefore, the assumption that
the potential well for a bound helicase is independent of hydrolysis state is consistent with experiments.

In our model, an actively unwinding helicase shows a decrease in attachment time. Previous work has
suggested that high helicase processivity may require two helicase-NA binding sites—one on the ssNA, and
another on the dsNA[1, 54, 55]. In this mechanism, a helicase may unbind from the ssNA but remain bound
at the dsNA site. The opportunity for dsNA binding is absent when the helicase translocates on ssNA.
This eﬀect can be incorporated in our description by introducing an extra binding energy and consequently
reduced detachment rate if the helicase is close to the junction.

Both the velocity of unwinding and measures of processivity are sensitive to ∆G, the average free energy
of NA base-pair opening. The value of ∆G can be controlled in single-molecule experiments where tension
is applied to the ends of the NA, by the concentration of ss-binding proteins in the buﬀer solution, and by
varying the base composition of the NA.

Measurements of helicase velocity and processivity as a function of ∆G can provide information about
the interaction between helicase and NA ss-ds junction. Because the rate of passive unwinding is determined
by the opening probability of the base pair at the junction, the velocity and the processivity decrease rapidly
as ∆G increases. For active opening, the unwinding velocity as a function of ∆G depends sensitively on the
step height: while for larger values of Uo the velocity depends only weakly on ∆G, this dependence becomes
strong for small U0. The average attachment time hτ i behaves diﬀerently. For a hard-wall interaction
potential, the attachment time is independent of ∆G. For active unwinding, the attachment time depends
strongly on ∆G for larger Uo and tends to decrease for increasing ∆G. The eﬀects of ∆G on velocity and
attachment time approximately cancel when computing the processivities, so that the behavior of hδmi as a
function of ∆G is similar for diﬀerent step heights. Galletto et al. found that the unwinding rate of DnaB
helicase depends on the DNA GC content[56]. Varying the fraction of GC versus AT base pairs changes
the average ∆G of the NA template. The dependence on GC content found in these experiments would be
expected in our model for an interaction potential with a small (or zero) step height.

For the helicase PcrA, crystal structures suggest that the protein binds both the ss and dsDNA and
distorts the double helix [51]. If the protein residues which have been proposed to interact with dsDNA are
mutated, the mutant proteins hydrolyze ATP in the presence of ssDNA at a rate similar to the wild-type
protein, but unwind dsDNA 10-30 times more slowly than wild type[57]. In the language of our analysis,
the mutations may alter the interaction potential between junction and helicase such that it resembles the
passive (hard-wall) case. In our description, starting from a situation of active opening with optimally chosen
step height and step number to a passive case with hard-wall potential typically leads to a decrease of the
unwinding rate by a factor of c−1 ≈ 7. Further altering the potential to an attractive linear potential[40]
with a well depth of 2 kBT decreases the unwinding rate by a factor of 35. Small changes to the interaction
potential can thus cause the unwinding rate to vary by a large factor.

In single-molecule experiments on UvrD helicase, Dessinges et al. observed the unwinding of DNA
In these experiments, the end-to-end extension of a tethered
molecules by UvrD at diﬀerent forces[30].
DNA molecule changes with time as a result of the transformation of dsDNA into ssDNA by the helicase.
These single-molecule experiments found that unwinding can be induced by UvrD monomers. However,
bulk experiments have suggested that helicase activity requires UvrD dimers[58, 59, 60], even though UvrD
monomers have a large processivity (2400 bases) when translocating on ssDNA[60]. The reasons for this
diﬀerence are not currently understood. The velocity of unwinding was shown by Dessinges et al. to depend

dependent rate.
It was suggested that these events occur when a UvrD molecule bound near the ss-ds
junction switches from one DNA single strand to the other. Because the two single strands have opposite
polarity, the helicase might move away from the junction after strand switching.
In this interpretation,
the re-zipping events provide information on ss translocation of UvrD. The re-zipping velocity would be
expected to be greater than or equal to the ss translocation rate of UvrD, because the energetically favorable
re-annealing of the two DNA strands behind the helicase might accelerate the protein’s motion.

We can relate three key measurements of UvrD motion by Dessinges et al.[30] to the behavior of active
unwinding discussed here. First, the experiments show that the re-zipping velocity and the unwinding
velocity are comparable in certain situations: the re-zipping velocity is approximately 15% larger than the
unwinding rate at 35 pN applied force. Second, the eﬀective detachment rate is about 10 times larger
during unwinding than during re-zipping (at 35 pN). Third, the measured unwinding velocity is only weakly
dependent on ∆G. The velocity was measured for 3 pN and 35 pN applied force on the DNA. The ﬁrst
case corresponds to an increase of ∆G, while in the second case ∆G decreases[30]. If we interpret re-zipping
events as approximating the ss translocation behavior of UvrD, all three of these experimental observations
are consistent with our description of an active helicase.

The comparison of these data to bulk measurements reveals agreement in the unbinding rate during
ss translocation but not in the unwinding rate. The unbinding rate of UvrD monomers translocating on
ssDNA measured in bulk by Fischer et al.
is comparable to (2 times larger than) the unbinding rate
measured by Dessinges et al.
found that
the UvrD unwinding rate was approximately 3 times slower than the ss translocation rate[60]. However, the
bulk experiments of Fischer et al. observed unwinding only by UvrD dimers, whereas the single-molecule
experiments of Dessinges et al. observed unwinding by UvrD monomers. Therefore the unwinding data may
not be directly comparable.

Our physical theory describes how helicase unwinding velocity and processivity depend on the interaction
potential between the helicase and the ss-ds junction. This type of theory includes more detail then
models based on kinetic states and transitions between them, while neglecting many details present in
all-atom simulation models. Physical descriptions of the type we describe here complement other modeling
frameworks. Simplifying some aspects of the system—for example, our choice to neglect the biochemical
states which occur during helicase ss translocation—allows us to focus on the coupling between helicase
translocation and NA unwinding. This level of detail may allow one to relate observed helicase behavior
to simple physical mechanisms, and thereby gain more insight into the parameters which are important for
helicase behavior. For example, experiments on UvrD suggest that this helicase unbinds more rapidly when
unwinding dsDNA that during ss translocation[30]. Our model gives a physical picture for why this might
happen: an interaction potential corresponding to active opening naturally leads to accelerated helicase
unbinding.

Our simple description neglects several eﬀects. We ignore deformations of the NA strand, such as
bending and torsion, and treat the strand as a rigid structure. The helicase is described by forward and
backward rates only; we neglect the details of the protein’s biochemical states. In addition, we ignore the
eﬀects of the NA base sequence on opening. These eﬀects are believed to be weak for most helicases[1],
although sequence dependence has been demonstrated for Rho[61] and DnaB[56] helicases. Recent work by
Kafri, Lubensky and Nelson[62] shows that a motor protein which translocates on a random track can show
interesting behavior near the stall force.

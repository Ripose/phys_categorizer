We report the reproducible ﬁrst-principles folding of the 40 amino acid, three-helix headpiece of
the HIV accessory protein in a recently developed all-atom free-energy forceﬁeld. Six of twenty
simulations using an adapted basin-hopping method converged to better than 3 ˚A backbone RMS
deviation to the experimental structure. Using over 60,000 low-energy conformations of this protein,
we constructed a decoy tree that completely characterizes its folding funnel.

Available genomic and sequence information for pro-
teins contains a wealth of biomedical information that be-
comes accessible when translated into three-dimensional
structure [1]. While theoretical models for protein struc-
ture prediction [2, 3] that partially rely on experimen-
tal information have shown consistent progress[4], the
assessment of de-novo strategies that rely on sequence
information alone has been much less favorable [5]. The
development of such techniques, in particular of transfer-
able ﬁrst-principle all-atom folding methods, would sig-
niﬁcantly beneﬁt the understanding of protein families
where little experimental information is available, the
prediction of novel folds as well as the investigation of
protein association and dynamics which are presently dif-
ﬁcult to probe experimentally. Recent progress for small
peptides [3, 6, 7, 8] documents both the feasibility of this
approach as well as its limitations [9, 10], in particualr
those associated with the direct simulation of the folding
process through molecular dynamics [11].

Overwhelming experimental evidence supports the
thermodynamic hypothesis [12] that many proteins are
in thermodynamic equilibrium with their environment:
their native state thus corresponds to the global mini-
mum of their free energy landscape [13]. The free energy
of the system is accessible either indirectly by explicit
ensemble averaging of the combined internal energy of
protein and solvent, or directly in a free-energy force-
ﬁeld where an implicit solvation model approximates di-
rect interactions with the solvent as well as most of the
entropic contributions. We developed an all-atom pro-
tein forceﬁeld (PFF01) [8, 14, 15] with an area-based
implicit solvent model that approximates the free energy
of peptide conformations in the natural solvent. Using
a rational decoy approach this forceﬁeld was optimized
to correctly predict the native structure of the 36-amino
acid headgroup of villin [9, 10, 11]. Without further pa-
rameter adjustment we then simulated the structurally
conserved 40 amino-acid headpiece of the autonomously
folding HIV accessory protein (1F4I-40) [16] with a mod-
iﬁed basin hopping technique [17, 18]. Out of twenty
simulations the ﬁve energetically lowest correctly repro-

duced the NMR structure of this three-helix protein with
a backbone RMS deviation of less than 3 ˚A. The combina-
tion of decoy based model development for the free energy
with eﬃcient stochastic optimization methods suggests a
viable route for protein structure prediction at the all
atom level with present day computational resources.

Model: We have recently developed an all-atom pro-
tein forceﬁeld (PFF01), which was used to reproducibly
fold the 20 amino acid trp-cage protein [8]. PFF01 [15]
comprises an atomically resolved electrostatic model with
group speciﬁc dielectric constants and a Lennard Jones
parameterization that was adapted to the experimental
distance distributions from crystal structures of 138 pro-
teins [19]. Interaction with the ﬁctitious solvent are mod-
eled in a simple solvent accessible surface approach [20],
where the solvation free-energies per unit surface were ﬁt-
ted to the enthalpies of solvation of the Gly-X-Gly series
of peptides [21]. The only low-energy degrees of freedom
available to the peptide during the folding process are
rotations of the dihedral angles of the backbone and the
sidechains, these are the only moves considered during
the simulation. There are two move-classes, small ran-
dom rotations about a single angle and library moves,
which set a particular backbone dihedral to a permitted
value in the Ramachandran plot.

If an accurate model for the free energy of the pro-
tein in its environment is available, stochastic optimiza-
tion methods can be used to locate the global optimum
of the free-energy landscape orders of magnitude faster
than traditional simulation techniques. We adapted the
basin hopping technique [17] (BHT) for protein simula-
tions by replacing a single minimization step with a simu-
lated annealing run [22] with self-adapting cooling cycle
and length. At the end of one annealing step the new
conformation was accepted if its energy diﬀerence to the
current conﬁguration was no higher than a given thresh-
old energy εT , an approach recently proven optimal for
certain optimization problems [23]. Each simulation was
performed in three separate steps: First we used a high
temperature bracket of 800/300 K (εT =15 K) for the an-
nealing window and reduced the strength of the solvent

correct secondary structure content as a prerequisite.

The good agreement between the folded and the ex-
perimental structure is also evident from Figure (1),
which shows the secondary structure alignment of the
native and the folded conformations. The good physi-
cal alignment of the helices illustrates the importance of
hydrophobic contacts to correctly fold this protein. An
independent measure to assess the quality of these con-
tacts is to compare the Cβ-Cβ distances (which corre-
spond to the NOE constraints of the NMR experiments
that determine tertiary structure) in the folded structure

terms in the forceﬁeld by 20%. The second step started
from the ﬁnal conﬁgurations of the ﬁrst run, used the
same annealing window but the full solvent interactions.
In the third step the resulting structures were further an-
nealed in a low temperature bracket of 600/3 K (εT =1K).
Within each annealing run the temperature was geomet-
rically decreased, also the number of steps per annealing
run was gradually increased to ensure better convergence.
In total each simulation comprised 107 energy evaluations
with a computational eﬀort roughly corresponding to a
10 ns MD simulation (in vacuum with 1 fs timestep). Af-
ter this time no signiﬁcant energy ﬂuctuations occurred
in the simulations, indicating that each had settled into
a metastable conﬁguration.

Results: Using PFF01 we performed 20 independent
modiﬁed basin hopping simulations of the structurally
conserved 40 amino-acid headpiece of the HIV accessory
protein (pdb-code 1F4I, sequence: QEKEAIERLK AL-
GFEESLVI QAYFACEKNE NLAANFLLSQ). The best
structures found in each run were ranked according to
their energy and the backbone RMS deviation (RMSB)
to the NMR structure was computed. Table (I) demon-
strates that the ﬁve lowest structures had to good accu-
racy converged to the NMR structure of the protein. The
ﬁrst non-native decoy appears in position six, with an
energy deviation of 5 kcal/mol (in our model) and a sig-
niﬁcant RMSB deviation. The table demonstrates that
all low-energy structures have essentially the same sec-
ondary structure, i.e. position and length of the helices
are always correctly predicted, even if the protein did not
fold correctly. The degree of secondary structure content
and similarity decreases for the decoys with higher energy
(data not shown) in good correlation with their energy.
From the standpoint of the optimization approach (but
not necessarily for the physical folding scenario) this sug-
gests that successful folding requires the formation of the

surfaces, which are associated with Levinthals para-
dox [25, 26] in the context of protein folding. Well struc-
tured trees with few terminal branches suggest the exis-
tence of a folding funnel [13], consistent with the “new”
paradigm for protein folding [27]. From this perspec-
tive the structure in Figure (3) this tree is indicative of
the existence of a very broad folding funnel [13] with pro-
nounced competing secondary metastable conformations,
which are depicted as the non-native terminal minima of
the tree. The discretization of the energy axis in inter-
vals of 2 kcal/mol starting from the native conformation
results in a smoothing of the free-energy surface. Each
line in the ﬁgure corresponds to a family containing hun-
dreds tothousands of structures, which are all associated
with the same low-lying metastable conformation (the
terminal point of the branch). Simulations trapped in
such a metastable state must overcome a potential en-
ergy barrier of the order of the energy diﬀerence to the
next highest branching point of the tree to visit another
structure. The branching points of the tree were con-
structed only from structures of the decoy set and not
through independent transition state search among the
terminal structures. In addition, main-chain entropy is
neglected in this analysis, which results in an overesti-
mation of the barrier. Further investigations to more
accurately determine the transition states are presently
under way.

The lowest competing terminal branch (branch C),
associated with decoy D06 in Table (I), is less than 5
kcal/mol above the best native decoy. Decoy D06 has
comparable energy to competing decoys but much larger
RMSB deviation and has few long-range native contacts.
This structure (see Figure (4)) has also three helices
of comparable length and sequence location, but diﬀers
from the native structure in the relative alignment of the

structure 1F4I in comparison to the NMR structure. Each
square encodes the deviation between the Cβ-Cβ distance of
two amino acids in the NMR to the Cβ-Cβ distance of the

dicate a deviation of less than 1.50 ˚A (2.25 ˚A). White squares

to those of the native structure. The color coded Cβ-Cβ
distance in Figure (2) demonstrates a 66 % (80 %) co-
incidence of the Cβ-Cβ distance distances to within one
(1.5) standard deviations of the experimental resolution.
The dark diagonal block indicate intra-helical contacts,
which are, perhaps not too surprisingly, resolved to very
good accuracy. The oﬀ-diagonal dark blocks, however,
indicate that also a large fraction of long range native
contacts is reproduced correctly.

Starting from intermediate structures of the folding
simulations we generated over 60,000 low-energy confor-
mations (decoys). Decoys with a root mean square de-
viation of the backbone (RMSB) deviation of less than
3 ˚A were grouped into families with free energy brack-
ets of 2 kcal/mol. We then resolved the topological
hierarchy[18, 24] of the associated potential energy sur-
face through the construction of a decoy tree (Figure (3))
that illustrates the low-energy structure of the free en-
ergy surface. Beginning from the best conformation, we
draw a vertical line for each decoy family in this window.
Moving upward in energy the number of decoys in each
family grows almost exponentially in the low energy re-
gion which we can resolve well. As a result the diversity
of each family grows until diﬀerent families unite. Family
membership is associative, i.e. as soon as two decoys in
diﬀerent branches have an RMSB deviation of less than 3
˚A, all members of both families belong to one superfam-
ily. Pictorially this representation results in an inverted
tree-like structure that characterizes the topology of the
metastable states of the free energy surface.

Trees with very short stems and many low-energy
branches are characteristic of glassy potential energy

ingly share very similar secondary structure with the na-
tive conﬁgurations. Investigations of other proteins must
show, whether this pattern persist also for other proteins.

It should be noted that the success of the optimiza-
tion approach depends strongly on the ability of the opti-
mization technique to diﬀerentiate between the low-lying
minima of the FES in a realistic forceﬁeld. The perfor-
mance of optimization methods is often strongly problem
dependent, but with 1F4I, 1VII and 1L2Y three nontriv-
ial model systems exist on which diﬀerent optimization
methods can be evaluated. The decoy sets generated and
insights regarding low-lying metastable states can also
serve as a test-bed for the development of coarse-grained
protein models. PFF01 is presently be validated for other
peptides and proteins and rationally evolved to correctly
predict the structure of larger fold families.

helices with respect to each. The RMSB deviation of the
low-lying terminal structures to the NMR structures is
large (i.e. comparable with the RMSB deviation to un-
folded structures), indicating that conserved secondary
structure elements, rather than distance constraints char-
acterize the folding funnel. The low lying local minima
are thus characterized by varying spatial arrangements of
similar secondary structure elements, a property that is
ill represented by either RMSB deviation or the number
of native contacts.

Discussion: With this work we have demonstrated that
accurate free-energy forceﬁelds can predict the native
structure of proteins with nontrivial tertiary structure
with present day computational resources. This result
represents an in-silico realization of the thirty year-old
thermodynamic hypothesis that proteins are in thermo-
dynamic equilibrium with the environment under physio-
logical conditions [12]. Under this hypothesis, the native
structure of the protein can be predicted using stochastic
optimization methods orders of magnitude faster than by
direct simulation. Our results demonstrate that the im-
portant inﬂuence of the solvent can be modeled with a
relatively simple solvent accessible surface approach.

The analysis of the free energy surface supports the
funnel paradigm of protein folding for a nontrivial pro-
tein with a signiﬁcantly larger hydrophobic core than was
previously possible. The relatively small number of ter-
minal branches of the decoy tree oﬀers the ﬁrst glimpse
on the experimentally inaccesible structure of the folding
funnel. It suggest the exsitence of a broad folding fun-
nel with well deﬁned secondary metastable states which
may constitute important folding intermediates. The free
energy optimization approach used here permitted the
characterization of these low-lying states, which surpris-

Abstract

We report a noise induced delay of bifurcation in a simple pulse-coupled

neural circuit. We study the behavior of two neural oscillators, each individ-

ually governed by saddle-node dynamics, with reciprocal excitatory synaptic

connections. In the deterministic circuit, the synaptic current amplitude acts

as a control parameter to move the circuit from a mono-stable regime through

a bifurcation into a bistable regime. In this regime stable sustained anti-phase

oscillations in both neurons coexist with a stable rest state. We introduce a

small amount of random current into both neurons to model possible ran-

domly arriving synaptic inputs. We ﬁnd that such random noise delays the

onset of bistability, even though in decoupled neurons noise tends to advance

bifurcations and the circuit has only excitatory coupling. We show that the

delay is dependent on the level of noise and suggest that a curious stochastic

“anti-resonance” is present.

I. INTRODUCTION

The eﬀects of random currents on the ﬁring behavior of real and model neurons have

received a considerable amount of attention in neurobiology and physics literature [1–8].

Several experimental results indicate that in vivo neural spike trains seem to be excessively

noisy, with interspike interval distribution showing 1/f spectra [9]. However, other in vitro

experiments have shown that noisy stimuli can produce highly reliable ﬁring with the neu-

ron locking onto large range variations of the noise [2,10]. A number of theoretical studies

have attempted to reconcile such seemingly disparate results by studying the dynamics of

neural networks with additive noise, showing that high variance ﬁring behavior can arise in

networks of threshold elements [12]. At the same time additive noise in oscillating networks

of more realistic neurons destabilizes synchronous and phase locked behavior, producing

complicated spatiotemporal patterns [13]. These simulation results have appeared in the

context of a body of literature that has delved into the eﬀects of noise on the response of ex-

citable and oscillatory non-linear dynamical systems. In particular a number of investigators

have considered what happens to single neurons and circuits of neurons when noise perturbs

periodically modulated input signals. Experimental work has identiﬁed noise induced signal

ampliﬁcation and resonance in a number of preparations e.g. [14]. Theoretical analyses have

successfully explained such ﬁndings employing the language of stochastic resonance devel-

oped originally for general multi-stable dynamical systems. There the enhancement of the

subthreshold stimuli and encoding of stimulus structure had a non-linear relationship with

the noise amplitude, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio relationship with a pronounced peak.

Noise eﬀects have also been studied in the context of indigenous oscillations in neural mod-

els, focusing on the so-called “autonomous stochastic resonance” [5]. For example, a recent

report by Lee shows noise induced coherence resonance in a Hodgkin-Huxley model, with

pre-cursors of the sub-critical Hopf bifurcation revealed by the action of random currents

[6]. In this sense noise “advanced” the bifurcation. Similar eﬀects have also been found in

a generic saddle-node driven oscillator where noise advances the onset of oscillations and

2

upregulates the mean frequency [15,16]

Although pulse coupled or synaptically coupled neural networks have received much

recent attention with regard to their dynamics [17,18] and computational power [19], we

believe that this Letter is the ﬁrst attempt to look in detail at the eﬀects of noise on the

onset of synaptically sustained ﬁring in such networks. That is, circuits of intrinsically

quiescent neurons where activity occurs purely due to the recurrent synaptic interactions.

To our knowledge, almost all eﬀorts to study the interplay of noise and neural oscillators

report noise induced increase in ﬁring and advancement of bifurcations, e.g. [15]. In this

light our ﬁnding is rather intriguing since we observe a noise induced delay of bifurcation

in a purely positively coupled circuit of neural oscillators. We also observe a phenomenon

that may be termed “stochastic anti-resonance”, since the delay of bifurcation depends non-

linearly on the noise level. Our analysis of this system leads us to conclude that the relative

width of the attractor basins for the quiescent and persistent ﬁring states is the key factor

in determining whether stochastic resonance has a delaying, neutral, or advancing eﬀect on

the bifurcation.

Below we summarize the dynamics of the spiking neuron used in this circuit (the θ-

neuron), and analyze the case of two coupled cells in the regimes of weak and strong excita-

tory coupling in both noise free and noisy simulations. Since we believe that the phenomenon

we observe is generic for circuits of recurrently coupled spiking neurons, ﬁrst we describe

the stochastic anti-resonance phenomenon observed in this simple circuit.

Figure 1A, upper trace shows the ﬁring patterns of two cells whose spiking behavior

results from mutual excitatory synapses. The cells are initially quiescent (they are not

intrinsically spiking) and their activity results from an initial external input to one cell.

Activity can be terminated by small levels of noise (Figure 1A, middle trace), whilst increased

noise levels cause intermittent ﬁring (Figure 1A, lower trace). Figure 1B plots the probability

(M1) of observing ﬁring in the last 200 msecs of a 2000 msec run over an ensemble of 1000

sample paths. The x-axis plots the strength of the synaptic coupling (gs). In the noise free

circuit, g ∗

s is the critical value of coupling above which sustained ﬁring occurs (i.e. M1=0 for

3

gs < g ∗

s , M1=1 for gs ≥ g ∗

s). Since the synaptically sustained ﬁring apears with a non-zero

frequency, we suspect that the bifurcation here is of a sub-critical Hopf type. At small noise

levels (Figure 1B, traces 1,2), increasing the noise amplitude progressively shifts the curves

of M1 to the right with respect to the noise-free case. This behavior is surprising as addition

of small amounts of noise for a single autonomously spiking θ-neuron induces the opposite

eﬀect - noise advanced bifurcation (see [21]). The eﬀect has been described in a generic

saddle-node oscillator in [15]. Above a critical noise value, the onset of sustained ﬁring is

advanced back to the left (Figure 1B, traces 3 and higher). Thus the bifurcation is delayed

for low noise amplitudes and advanced with higher noise. Figure 1C shows that there is a

non-linear relationship between the amount of injected noise and the ﬁring probability. Here

we plot the value of gs = g2/3

s

at which continuous sustained ﬁring is observed in 2/3 of the

sample paths, the same points are marked on the probability plots in Figure 1B. Adding

small amounts of noise moves the probability curves to the right. This can be viewed as

a probabilistic signature of a delay of the bifurcation. As the noise amplitude grows, the

bifurcation is delayed further, and the test point g2/3

s

occurs at higher gs values. As the noise

is increased further, noise ﬂuctuations are strong enough to induce intermittent ﬁring. Both

the probability curves and the location of the test point then move back to the left towards

the noise-free value. If we consider the sustained ﬁring as signal (perturbed by noise), this

resembles stochastic resonance, however here the net eﬀect of noise is “negative”.

It should be noted that this eﬀect is not restricted to the dynamics of the θ-neuron. All

aspects of noise induced delay of bifurcation seen above also occur in a circuit where each

of the cells is modeled with a more complicated conductance based, Hodgkin-Huxley model

for a pyramidal neuron [11] (simulations not shown). This is not surprising, since this model

can be readily reduced to the θ-neuron which we now describe.

4

II. THE θ-NEURON

The θ-neuron model developed by Ermentrout and Gutkin [20,21] is derived from the

observation that wide class of neuronal models of cortical neurons, based on the electro-

physiological model of Hodgkin and Huxley show a saddle-node type bifurcation at a critical

parameter value. This parameter determines the dynamical behavior of the solutions of the

corresponding system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. General dynamical systems theory

tells us that the qualitative behavior in some neighborhood of the bifurcation point (which

may be quite large as it extends up to the next bifurcation or other dynamic transition) is

governed by the reduction of the system to the center manifold. In the present case of the

saddle-node bifurcation which is the simplest bifurcation type, this leads to the following

diﬀerential equation

dx
dt

= λ + x2.

(1)

Here, the bifurcation parameter λ is considered as the input to the neuron while x records

its activity. Obviously, a solution to this equation tends to inﬁnity in ﬁnite time. This is

considered as a spiking event, and the initial values are then reset to −∞. In order to have

a model that does not exhibit such formal singularities, one introduces a phase variable θ

that is 2π-periodic via

x = tan(

θ
2

).

(2)

θ is then a variable with domain the unit circle S 1, and a spike now corresponds to a period

of θ. Spikes are no longer represented by transitions through inﬁnity, but by changes of some

discrete topological invariant. The original diﬀerential equation is then transformed into

dθ
dt

= (1 − cos(θ)) + (1 + cos(θ))λ.

(3)

Due to the nonlinearity of the transformation from x to θ, the input λ is no longer additive.

In fact, it is easy to show that (1 + cosθ) is the phase resetting function for the model [20].

As before, the bifurcation occurs at λ = 0. There, we have precisely one rest point, namely

5

θ = 0 which is degenerate. In any case, the sensitivity to the input λ is highest at θ = 0

and lowest at θ = π which according to the derivation of our equation is considered as the

spike point. When λ is positive, the equation does not have any rest point. In this case, θ

continues to increase all the time, and the neuron is perpetually ﬁring. When λ is negative,

however, there are two rest points, a stable one denoted by θr and an unstable one θt > θr.

If θ is larger than θt it increases until it completes a period and comes to rest at θr + 2π

which is identiﬁed with θr as we are working on the unit circle S 1. Thus, if the phase is

above the threshold value θt, a spike occurs and the neuron returns to rest. So far, we have

tacitly assumed that the input λ is constant. We now consider the situation where the input

can be decomposed as

λ = β + ση,

(4)

where β is a constant term, the so-called bias, while η is (white) noise and σ its intensity.

In this case, suﬃciently strong noise can occasionally push the phase θ beyond the thresh-

old value θt causing intermittent ﬁring (Figure 1C). Equation 3 now becomes a canonical

stochastic saddle-node oscillator which has been studied in Rappel & Wooten and Gutkin

& Ermentrout [21].

III. COUPLED NEURONS

We now consider the situation where we have two neurons (distinguished by subscripts

i = 1, 2). The dynamics then takes place on the product of two circles, i.e. on a two-

dimensional torus T , represented by the square [−π, π] × [−π, π] in the plane, with periodic

boundary identiﬁcations. We ﬁrst consider the simple case of two uncoupled, noise-free

neurons (σ1 = σ2 = 0) with the same bias β. Their dynamics are independent.

In the

phase plot shown in Figure 2(i) the diagonal is always an invariant curve, corresponding to

synchronized activity of the two neurons. If β > 0, both neurons continue to ﬁre, although

their phase diﬀerence, if not 0 initially, is not constant, due to the nonlinearity of the

6

diﬀerential equation governing it. If β = 0, (0, 0) is a degenerate rest point (Figure 2(ii)).

The two curves θ1 = θ2 = 0 are homoclinic orbits and all ﬂow lines eventually terminate at

this ﬁxed point. One or both neurons will spike before returning to rest if their initial phase

is between 0 and π.

If β < 0 (Figure 2(iii)), we have four ﬁxed points - the attractor (θ1 = θ2 = θr), the

repeller (θ1 = θ2 = θt), and the two saddles where one of the neurons has its phase at θr

(rest) and the other one at θt (threshold). Some special heteroclinic orbits are given by the

straight lines where one of the two neurons stays at θt while the other one moves from the

threshold to the rest value, spiking if its initial phase was above threshold. All other ﬂow

lines terminate at the attractor. We now add an interaction term sigs to the input of neuron

i. si is considered as the synaptic input from neuron j to neuron i (i 6= j) and gs is the

synaptic intensity. (One could also study the case of a single neuron i for which si represents

synaptic self-coupling, but here we are interested in the case of two coupled neurons). A

precise equation for si can be derived from electrophysiological models, however for our

qualitative study we only need the characteristic features that it stays bounded between 0

and 1. Typically, it is peaked near the spike of neuron j, i.e. where θj = π. With this

interaction term, the equation for neuron i then becomes

dθi
dt

= (1 − cos(θi)) + (1 + cos(θi))(β + gssi + ση).

(5)

Since si represents the input that neuron i receives from neuron j, si should essentially be

considered as a function of the phase θj of j. Once more, we ﬁrst consider the situation

without noise, i.e. σ = 0 (although our ﬁnal aim is to understand the eﬀect of noise

on the dynamic behavior of the coupled neurons). We also assume that we are in the

excitable region, i.e. β < 0. gs is assumed to be positive (excitatory coupling), and so the

coupling counteracts the eﬀect of the bias to a certain extent, a crucial diﬀerence being,

however, that the synaptic input to each neuron is time dependent, in contrast to the

constant bias. If gs is suﬃciently small, the qualitative situation does not change compared

to the case without coupling, i.e. gs = 0. We still have a heteroclinic orbit from the saddle

7

(θ1 = θt, θ2 = θr) to the attractor (θr, θr), although θ2 does not stay constant anymore along

that orbit, but increases ﬁrst a little due to the input from neuron 1 before it descends again

to the rest value. (Figure 2(iv)). (Of course, we also get such an orbit with the roles of

the two neurons reversed; in fact, the dynamical picture is always invariant under reﬂection

across the diagonal, i.e.under exchanging the two neurons.) If gs reaches some critical value

s , however, the heteroclinic orbit starting at (θt, θr) does not terminate anymore at the
g ∗

attractor, and the value of the phase of neuron 2 is increased so much by the synaptic

interaction that it reaches the other saddle (θr, θt) (Figure 2v). Besides two heteroclinic

orbits that go from the repeller to the two saddles as before, all other orbits still terminate

at the attractor (θr, θr), for gs = g ∗

s . If gs is increased beyond g ∗

s, however, the heteroclinic

orbit between the two saddles mutates into a stable attractor (Figure 2(vi)). It corresponds

to sustained asynchronous ﬁring of the two neurons. In fact, if the phase diﬀerence between

the two neurons is too small, the dynamics converges towards the double rest point (except

in some region in the vicinity of the node), and both neurons stop ﬁring. This is caused by

the fact that when the two neurons are close to synchrony, neither cell is sensitive enough

to its synaptic input to maintain ﬁring (an eﬀective refractory period). Conversely, if they

are out of synchrony, a single spike can induce the second neuron to ﬁre at a time when the

ﬁrst one is close to rest, and sensitive to synaptic input itself. If gs is only slightly above

the critical value, the basin of attraction of that limit cycle will still be relatively small,

but as gs is increased further, the basin grows in size until eventually it is larger than the

basin of attraction of the double rest point. On the basis of the preceding analysis, it is

now straightforward to predict the eﬀect of noise. If gs is only slightly above the critical

value g ∗

s, a small amount of noise is more likely to kick the dynamics out of the narrow

basin of attraction of the asynchronous limit cycle and into the large basin of the double

rest point than vice versa. In eﬀect, a small noise level increases the critical parameter value

required for the qualitative transition to sustained asynchronous ﬁring. A larger amount of

noise, however, has the potential to move the dynamics from the rest point into the basin

of attraction of the asynchronous limit cycle. Once in that basin, the neurons will ﬁre.

8

Thus, for large noise in that regime, one will observe that the neurons will ﬁre, perhaps

with some intermissions spent near the double rest point. So, a larger value of noise will

cause intermittent periods of sustained ﬁring of the two neurons even at somewhat smaller

values of gs. In eﬀect, it decreases the value of the critical parameter. Thus, we observe

a genuinely nonlinear eﬀect of the noise level σ (Figure 1E). For values of the coupling gs

that are substantially larger than the critical value g ∗

s , even small amounts of noise have

a good chance of perturbing the dynamics out of the attracting vicinity of the double rest

point into the attracting region of the asynchronous limit cycle. This will further enhance

the sustained asynchronous ﬁring pattern of the two neurons.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we report a new and unusual eﬀect of noise in a simple neural circuit. When

the sustained oscillations in the circuit are induced by recurrent excitatory coupling, small

noise levels can exert a strong inﬂuence on the circuit dynamics, often abolishing the ﬁring.

The probability of observing sustained ﬁring has been used to characterize the transition

from quiescent to oscillatory behavior. Figure 1B clearly shows that in this system, noise

delays this transition. Noise induced delay of bifurcation can therefore occur in a completely

positively coupled circuit. The same noise has the exact opposite eﬀect of advancing the

bifurcation when it is applied to a single autonomously ﬁring neuron. The paradoxical eﬀect

of noise in this circuit can be understood by considering the structure of its phase plane - and

in particular the width of the attractor basins for the sustained antiphase oscillations. When

the width of the attractor basin is small, small levels of noise can perturb the system into the

larger basin of the stable quiescent state. However, transitions in the opposite direction from

the rest-state to a sustained ﬁring state can only occur when noise ﬂuctuations reach a critical

value. Above this value, transitions into the ﬁring state begin to counteract transitions into

the quiescent state. Alternatively, as the coupling strength increases, the basin of attraction

for the sustained ﬁring solution grows at the expense of the quiescent state. The negative

9

(bifurcation-delaying) eﬀect of the noise is then eliminated. In this system low levels of noise

eﬀectively act as a switch to turn oﬀ otherwise continuous ﬁring behavior. Alternatively,

low levels of noise ensure that sustained ﬁring can only take place above a critical coupling

threshold. In this way, small amounts of noise may in fact help to reduce overall noise levels

by eliminating the formation of spurious attractors. It has yet to be determined whether

this eﬀective noise-induced control mechanism can be observed in large ensembles of coupled

neurons.

FIG. 1. Asynchronous synaptically sustained oscillations in a positively coupled 2-cell circuit.

A. Upper trace: the sustained ﬁring in the noise free circuit. Middle trace: the sustained ﬁring

can be terminated by the action of small amplitude noise. Lower trace:

larger amplitude noise

induces an intermittent ﬁring pattern. Here the noise injected into the two neurons is completely

correlated, but the results are qualitatively identical for uncorrelated noises. B. Increasing noise

delays sustained ﬁring for low noise levels (traces 1,2) and advances ﬁring for higher noise levels

2/3
(traces 3,4,5), the horizontal dashed line and the numbers mark the test points g
s

. C. Addition

of noise has a non-linear eﬀect on sustained ﬁring in this coupled circuit. Here we plot the location

2/3
of the test points g
s

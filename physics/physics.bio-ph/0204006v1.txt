Abstract

A lattice based model of a protein is used to study the dimerization equi-

librium of the GCN4 leucine zipper. Replica exchange Monte Carlo is used

to determine the free energy of both the monomeric and dimeric forms as a

function of temperature. The method of coincidences is then introduced to

explicitly calculate the entropy loss associated with dimerization, and from

it the free energy diﬀerence between monomer and dimer, as well as the cor-

responding equilibrium reaction constant. We ﬁnd that the entropy loss of

dimerization is a strong function of energy (or temperature), and that it is

much larger than previously estimated, especially for high energy states. The

results conﬁrm that it is possible to study the dimerization equilibrium of

GCN4 at physiological concentrations within the reduced representation of

the protein employed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Reduced models of a protein have been shown to provide a possible route for the esti-

mation of the free energy of dimerization of relatively short coiled-coils [1–3]. A key step in

the calculation of the free energy of dimerization concerns the entropy loss upon bringing

two monomer chains together to form the dimer. A practical method for the numerical

estimation of this entropy loss by Monte Carlo simulation is discussed in this paper.

The focus of our work is on the calculation of free energies of dimerization, and in

particular a re-analysis (using a subsequently improved model) of prior research about the

folding thermodynamics of the GCN4 leucine zipper [2,3]. Leucine zippers belong to the

class of structural motifs that are known as coiled coils. Generically, they comprise right

handed α helices wrapped around each other with a small left-handed super-helical twist

[4]. While leucine zippers can exist in both monomeric or dimeric form [5], GCN4 forms a

dimer in the crystalline phase [5].

Numerical calculations of the free energy diﬀerence between the monomeric and dimeric

forms of GCN4 have already been given in [2,3]. In ref. [2], the free energy of the monomer

was computed by transfer matrix methods, whereas the entropy change of dimerization was

estimated by Monte Carlo methods. Two monomers were placed in a parallel conﬁguration,

and the conﬁgurational partition function was estimated by placing the two monomers in

registry with one another, but considering diﬀerent position of the relative starting point

of each segment. The Entropy Sampling Monte Carlo method of Hao and Scheraga [6]

was used in ref. [3] to sample the conﬁgurational space of both monomer and dimer. By

using the values of the various terms that contribute to the entropy loss of dimerization

given in [2], the equilibrium dimer fraction was computed as a function of temperature and

monomer concentration. As a byproduct of the calculation, other equilibrium quantities

such as the helical content of the monomer and dimer were obtained, as well as an analysis

of the existence of possible folding intermediaries.

In our present work, we use the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo method [7–9] to obtain the

2

canonical distribution of both monomer and dimer forms separately. Re-weighting methods

are then used to calculate the respective free energies as a function of temperature [10,11].

In the ﬁnal step, a method is described to place both free energies on the same relative scale

so that the free energy diﬀerence between the monomer and dimer forms can be computed.

We believe that the method described in this paper allows a more accurate determination

of the entropy loss of dimerization than previously reported, and therefore it allows a more

accurate determination of the free energy diﬀerence between the monomeric and dimeric

forms as a function of temperature and concentration.

II. THE PROTEIN MODEL

Our analysis is based on a a reduced model in which a protein is represented by a sequence

of virtual bonds connecting eﬀective particles [12,13]. Each of these particles is assumed to

be located at the center of mass of the side chain and backbone α carbon. The eﬀective

particles are embedded in a regular cubic lattice of ﬁxed spacing that allows for a fairly

accurate representation of the backbone of known protein structures. This geometric part

of the model has been checked against all structures contained in the protein data bank [14].

The observed root mean squared deviation between the lattice representation of any protein

and its resolved structure is typically below 0.8 ˚A [15]. The actual resolution of the model

is of course lower, typically of the order of 2 ˚Afor small proteins.

Eﬀective interactions (force ﬁelds) are introduced among the particles that include

generic (sequence independent), and sequence speciﬁc contributions. The potentials as-

sociated with the generic type of interactions are deﬁned so as to introduce a bias toward

reasonable secondary structures. One such potential is introduced to account for the fact

that proteins exhibit a characteristic bimodal distribution of neighbor residue distances,

specially between the i-th and (i+4)-th residues. Conﬁgurations corresponding to the larger

distance in the distribution are associated with proteins that exhibit either β-type or ex-

panded coils, whereas the shorter distance corresponds to helices and turns [15]. A second

3

generic interaction further introduces a bias toward certain packing structures such as he-

lices and β-type states. The ﬁrst potential produces the required stiﬀness of the polypeptide

chain, whereas the second provides for local cooperative motion during packing.

Sequence speciﬁc interactions are of three types, and include short range interactions,

long range, pairwise interactions, and many body interactions. The short range pairwise

potentials are of statistical origin and are ﬁtted to nonhomologous reference structures.

This is accomplished by considering the known distances between pairs of aminoacids that

are separated by one through four bonds along the chain. Chirality is also introduced by

considering an interaction between the i-th and (i+3)-th and (i+6)-th bonds to produce

the correct pitch. Long range interactions are also of statistical origin, and are assumed to

depend not only on relative distances between the eﬀective atoms, but also on the relative

orientation between the corresponding bonds (for example, residues of opposite charges are

attractive when the corresponding bonds are parallel to each other, whereas the interaction

is weak or repulsive when they are anti-parallel).

Finally, although multi-body interactions are implicitly included (as an unknown contri-

bution) in the pairwise potentials determined from inter-residue distances and bond angles,

two additional terms are added to model hydrophobic interactions and the known probability

of a residue to have a given number of parallel and anti-parallel contacts. The hydrophobic

potential is estimated from the surface exposure of a given side chain, i.e., of all possible

contacts of a side chain, those that are not eﬀectively occupied by contacts with neighbor-

ing chains. The second multi-body potential introduces a bias toward known propensities

of various aminoacids to pack their side chains in parallel or anti-parallel orientation. Re-

cent applications of the methodology include the improvement of threading based structure

prediction [15], and direct ab-initio folding studies [16].

III. MONOMER-DIMER EQUILIBRIUM AND MONTE CARLO METHOD

At constant temperature and in thermodynamic equilibrium, the concentration of freely

associating monomers and dissociating dimers is governed by the reaction constant, K =

[D]/[M]2, where [M] and [D] are the concentrations of monomers and dimers respectively.

The mol fraction equilibrium constant can be expressed in terms of the canonical partition

functions of both monomer and dimer as [17],

Kx = c0K = N

= N

ZD
Z 2
M

QD
σDQ2
M

,

(1)

where N is the total number of chains (i.e., two chains per dimer), c0 = N/V the chain

concentration in a system of volume V , and ZM and ZD the canonical partition functions

of the monomer and dimer. The momenta degrees of freedom of both monomer and dimer

can be integrated out from their partition functions, and the respective kinetic contributions

cancel. We have therefore introduced the conﬁgurational partition functions QM and QD,

as well as the symmetry factor σD that takes into account the indistinguishability of the two

chains that form the dimer (σD = 2! in the present case) [17]. The purpose of the present

paper is an estimation of QM and QD by the Monte Carlo method.

Although it is in principle possible in to estimate the ratio of conﬁgurational partition

functions in Eq. (1) by direct simulation involving coexisting monomers and dimers that

transform into each other by association or dissociation, we have found that this is not

practical. First, proteins are large molecules (even in the reduced representation used in our

work and described in Appendix A), and only a small number of them can be placed in a

computational cell. Second, the protein models employed lack very long range interactions,

and hence there are large entropic contributions to the free energies which are diﬃcult

to sample accurately over the large conﬁgurational space of a protein. We instead follow

the approach of refs. [2,3] which consists of two steps: an independent computation of the

free energies of the monomer and dimer forms, followed by a transformation to a common

reference state so that the free energy diﬀerence between the two can be estimated.

5

The conﬁgurational partition functions QM and QD are estimated by the Replica Ex-

change Monte Carlo method [7]. Either a single monomer or a single dimer are placed

in the computational cell, and a set of canonical Monte Carlo simulations are performed

at set of prescribed neighboring temperatures. By conducting simulations involving only

one monomer or one dimer we are explicitly assuming that at physiological concentrations

monomer-dimer or dimer-dimer interactions can be neglected. The simulation to obtain QD

involves two identical monomers constrained during the course of the simulation to states

in which there is at least one inter chain contact.

We consider a set of r independent canonical simulations conducted in parallel at a set

of neighboring inverse temperatures βi, (i = 1, . . . , r). At ﬁxed intervals during the course of

the simulation, two conﬁgurations at diﬀerent temperatures (“replicas”) are chosen at ran-

dom, and their respective temperatures exchanged with probability deﬁned so as to preserve

detailed balance as given by the canonical probability distribution. Additional details about

the so-called Replica Exchange Monte Carlo method can be found in ref. [7]. At each inverse

temperature βi, a sample of ni statistically independent conﬁgurations is collected, and the

corresponding energy histograms hi(E) calculated with some arbitrary energy binning ∆E.

Re-weighting is then used to estimate the partition function by simultaneously solving [10],

where fi = βiF (βi) is the dimensionless thermodynamic free energy at inverse temperature

In the remainder of this Section, we describe a number of transformations of the con-

ﬁgurational partition functions QM and QD either for computational convenience or for the

calculation of the proper reference state. Given the assumed integration of particle mo-

menta, both QM and QD are expressed in terms of individual particle coordinates, and

have dimensions of V M and V 2M respectively, where M is the number of aminoacids in the

monomer. Elimination of rigid translation or rotation degrees of freedom from the conﬁgu-

rational partition functions, for example, is usually accomplished by introducing the center

of mass and principal axes of inertia of the molecule, and then relative coordinates for the in-

dividual particles. This requires either integrals over the corresponding canonical momenta,

or the explicit consideration in the coordinate integrals of the appropriate transformation

Jacobians. Since the Jacobians are conﬁguration dependent, we follow instead earlier work

[1], and conduct all our transformations on single particle coordinates alone thus obviat-

ing the need to introduce complicated Jacobian functions. For example, the elimination of

the degrees of freedom associated with uniform translations is accomplished by eliminating

the motion of particle 1 in one of the chains. The elimination of rigid rotation is partially

accomplished by disallowing the rotation of the bond between particles 1 and 2 of one of

the chains. Finally, in our estimate of entropy losses on dimerization (Section III A), we

exclusively use phase space volumes of single particle coordinates to maintain the necessary

dimensional consistency of Eq. (1) after all the transformations of both QM and QD that

are described in this Section.

The conﬁgurational partition functions QM and QD are independent of the location of

the molecule and of its orientation. The statistical accuracy of the simulation is greatly

increased if those degrees of freedom that correspond to rigid translations and rotations

are eliminated. The translational degree of freedom is eliminated by ﬁxing the location of

the ﬁrst particle in the monomer chain, or of chain one in the dimer. Since the partition

7

function is independent of this particle’s location, this coordinate can be integrated out to

yield a factor of V to the conﬁgurational partition function. The state of rigid rotation of

the molecule can be speciﬁed by three angles, or the orientation of one axis plus a rotation

around this axis. The orientation of the axis is deﬁned by its azimuth α

(

π, π) and

∈

−

a polar angle θ

(0, π). The rotation around this axis is given by a third angle γ

∈
π, π). Therefore the corresponding element of volume in conﬁguration space is given by

∈

(

−
the triple integral

dα d cos(β) dγ = 8π2. This value can also be exactly factored out

from the conﬁgurational partition function. However, given that the Monte Carlo method

R

used employs multiple bond transitions, we have found it convenient to proceed somewhat

diﬀerently. We disallow the Monte Carlo transition that corresponds to a two-bond change

at the N-terminus, and therefore eﬀectively eliminate the motion of particles 1 and 2 of the

chain. While ﬁxing the location of particle 1 still allows an exact calculation of the partition

function, eliminating the motion of particle 2 introduces two approximations. The ﬁrst one

involves the factorization of the conﬁguration space volume of particle 2. Since the motion

of this particle is not independent of the motion of the rest of the chain, this factorization

is only approximate. The degrees of freedom that are eliminated include a rotation around

an axis deﬁned by the bond vector between particles one and two, plus ﬂuctuations in

bond vector length. The elimination of the rotation is exact since the partition function is

independent of the orientation of this axis, and yields a factor of

dαd cos(β) = 4π to the

overall partition function. Factorization of the conﬁguration space volume associated with

R

bond length ﬂuctuations is only approximate. We write,

is the constant accessible volume for particle 2. The second approximation

made involves the assumption that the second atom is free to move within a spherical shell

centered in the ﬁrst atom, of inner radius Rmin = 4.35 ˚A and outer radius Rmax = 7.94 ˚A.

These two values are the smallest and largest bond distances allowed in the lattice model

8

used. Finally, note that the computed partition function Q′ still contains a factor of 2π

corresponding to the angle γ, the unrestricted rigid rotation of the molecule around the axis

deﬁned by the bond vector between particles one and two that is not eliminated during the

simulation.

A. Reference state calculation

In order to introduce a common scale for the monomer and dimer free energy sets

fM,i}
, we follow the method of ref. [2]. At suﬃciently high energies, one may assume

{

and

fD,i}

{

that inter-chain interactions are negligible, and that the internal motions within each dimer

chain are well approximated by those of the monomer. Therefore, and in this limit, the

entropy of the dimer is approximately twice that of the monomer. This fact allows one to

place the entropies from both monomer and dimer simulations in the same reference state

at high energy, and hence to compute free energy diﬀerences between the two.

We brieﬂy summarize here the steps taken for both monomer and dimer. The calculation

of the internal entropy of the monomer is straightforward. In the dimer case, however, the

contributions from the internal modes have to be separated from other degrees of freedom

related to the relative position and orientation of the two chains. Since in the dimer simu-

lation the two chains are constrained to have at least one contact, the computed entropies

of the dimer at high energies still contain entropy losses due to this constraint that have to

be estimated and subtracted to compute its internal entropy.

The monomer partition function Q′

M computed by the Monte Carlo method still contains

the contribution of one degree of freedom that is not associated with the internal motions of

the particles, and that corresponds to a rigid rotation of the molecule around the axis deﬁned

by the bond between particles 1 and 2. From the Monte Carlo simulation and re-weighting,

we obtain the probability density p′(E, β) that corresponds to the partition function Q′

M in

kB

= ln (p′(E, β)∆E) + βE,

a quantity that is independent of the inverse temperature β. The internal entropy follows

by subtracting the entropy of rotation of the azimuth angle of bond 2-3, and by adding the

estimate given above for the radial part of the ﬁrst bond,

2. Dimer

The dimer simulation is conducted by ﬁxing the positions of atoms 1 and 2 of one of the

chains. Therefore, a Monte Carlo estimate is obtained for Q′

D as given in Eq. (4), As was

the case for the monomer, we ﬁrst deﬁne the entropy as estimated from the simulation by

where p′(E, β) corresponds to Q′

D above. At suﬃciently high energies, where the internal

degrees of freedom of each chain are expected to become independent of the relative position

and orientation of both chains, the total conformational density of states factors into a

product involving the various contributions. In terms of the entropy, this factorization leads

to the decomposition,

The quantity V (2)

1

(E) is the accessible volume of particle 1 of chain 2 at energy E, and hence

yields the accessible volume loss of dimerization. Its estimate during the Monte Carlo run is

one of the main topics of this paper. Since the motion of the second chain relative to the ﬁrst

is constrained so that the number of inter-chain contacts is greater than zero, this volume will

10

be in general much less than V . The quantity ϕα(E) is the conﬁguration volume available

for the azimuth of bond 1 of chain 2, ϕcos β for the cosine of the polar angle of bond 1 of

chain 2, and ϕγ for the azimuth of bond 2 of chain 2. The product of the three represents the

loss of rotational conﬁguration space volume due to the formation of a dimer. If the second

chain were to rotate freely relative to the ﬁrst, we would have ϕα(E)ϕcos β(E)ϕγ(E) = 8π2.

The value found is less that this upper bound, but it approaches 8π2 as the energy of the

dimer is increased. As was the case with V (2)

2

(E), these three quantities also need to be

estimated during the simulation.

3. Conﬁguration space volume estimation

The conﬁguration space volumes V (2)

1

(E), ϕα(E), ϕcos β(E) and ϕγ(E) have been esti-

mated by using the method of coincidences [18]. Let Γ be the volume of a certain region

of conﬁguration space. Consider a ﬁnite sample of conﬁgurations that are uniformly dis-

tributed in Γ, and let Γ0 ≪
method involves computing the coincidence rate R that a pair of conﬁgurations in the sample

Γ be a small coarse-graining volume in conﬁguration space. The

belongs to the same coarse-graining volume. If the conﬁgurations are uniformly distributed

in Γ, the probability of a coincidence is R = Γ0/Γ. Therefore an estimate of R = nc/nt,

where nt is the total number of pairs in the sample, and nc the total number of coincidences

given Γ0, allows an estimation of Γ.

In order to satisfy the conditions of the method, we ﬁrst group all conﬁgurations (re-

gardless of their temperature) according to their energy. Since all the conﬁgurations with

the same energy are expected to occur with equal probability we calculate the coincidence

rate R(E) to estimate Γ(E) for the various magnitudes of interest (V (2)

, ϕα, ϕcos β, and ϕγ).

1

We next note some limitations in the accuracy of the method. If Γ0 is not much smaller

than Γ, error is introduced as Γ0 will not generate a good covering set of Γ, and it is likely

that the method will overestimate the size of the region Γ. On the other hand, if Γ0 is too

small, the number of coincidences will be small, and the statistical error in the determination

11

of R is large. There is a third source of error associated with the sample size at each energy

or, equivalently, the total number of pairs nt(E) [18]. The number of coincidences can be

estimated as,

with Γ0 such that all nt(E) conﬁgurations have been distributed among k groups. Therefore,

so that for a ﬁxed minimum nc(E) to insure adequate statistics of the coincidence rate, the

estimated value of Γ is bounded by n2

t (E). Therefore suﬃciently large samples are needed

at each energy if the corresponding value of Γ is large. We will further illustrate these

limitations in Section IV.

4. Reference entropy diﬀerence

In order to place both the monomer and dimer in the same reference state, we require

that in the limit of high E,

SD,int(E) + S0 = 2SM,int(E/2),

(7)

where S0 is a constant, independent of E, SD,int(E) is given by Eq. (6) and SM,int(E) by

Eq. (5). The quantity S0 is determined numerically as shown in Section IV.

Once the constant S0 has been determined, the free energy and partition function of the

dimer are re-scaled according to

IV. RESULTS

The method described in Section III has been tested on the GCN4 leucine zipper (a

31 residue segment with the characteristic heptad repeat sequence of leucine zippers). The

oligomerization equilibrium of the wild type has been addressed both experimentally [5] and

computationally [3], as well as that of several of its mutant forms [19,1]. Due to the short

length of the sequence, and the simplicity of its secondary structure, numerous computational

studies have addressed various aspects of the oligomerization process in GCN4, including

dimer and multi-mer equilibria [1], the stability of several of its sub-domains [2], oligomeric

equilibrium of several of its mutant forms [20], and other parameters of the coiled coil such

as the helical content as a function of temperature and a van’t Hoﬀ enthalpy analysis to

reveal the adequacy of a two state assumption for the dimerization process [3].

We have extended the analysis of [3] in two directions. First we use a Replica Exchange

Monte Carlo method instead of the Entropy Sampling Monte Carlo method of that reference

as the former provides a faster rate of convergence to the equilibrium distribution of the

dimer form. Second, we extend the method of calculation of the various entropy losses

upon dimerization, and show their strong dependence on the energy of the conﬁguration, a

dependence that was not taken into account in previous studies.

The results shown are based on two long runs for the monomer and dimer forms re-

spectively. Initial conﬁgurations were chosen close to the native state, but ﬁrst equilibrated

13

at constant temperature. Several runs with diﬀerent initial conditions yielded essentially

identical results for the various thermodynamic quantities presented, although none of the

dimer simulations involved an initial condition in a manifestly anti-parallel conﬁguration.

The monomer runs involved 2

106 independent conﬁgurations or steps after equilibration,

×

with one replica exchange attempted every 500 steps. Quantities for analysis were collected

every 250 steps. The dimer simulation comprises two identical, and initially parallel chains

with at least one contact between them [21]. The simulation in this case is conducted by re-

jecting all bond moves that would result in no contacts between the chains. The run for the

dimer involved 1.3

106 conﬁgurations, with the same frequency of analysis and of replica

×

exchange. In both cases, twenty independent replicas were run in parallel at dimensionless

temperatures in the range T = 0.5

1.45 in increments of 0.05. In the low temperature

−

range, the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the estimated location of the α

carbons in the model and the native conﬁguration is of the order of 3 ˚A(see Fig. 1). We

note that this RMSD range constitutes a prediction, and was not enforced during the course

of the simulation.

The analysis presented is based on energy histograms, and the subsequent re-weighting

described in Section III. The entire range of energies sampled by the monomer and the dimer

during the course of the simulation was divided into 100 equal bins, so that in dimensionless

units ∆E

0.2926 for the monomer and ∆E

0.3767 for the dimer.

In the case of the dimer, the location of all individual particles was also recorded every

250 steps in order to estimate the conﬁguration space volumes V (2)

, ϕα, ϕcos β and ϕγ. The

1

results presented for V (2)

1

are based on the spatial coordinates of particle 15 of chain 2 (the

chain that is free to move within the computational cell). Substantially identical results

follows from an analysis of any other particles in the chain, except for those in the immediate

vicinity of the N- or C- termini.

The conﬁguration space volume ϕα is estimated from the azimuth of the bond between

particles 15 and 16 of chain 2, and ϕcos β follow from cos β, β being the polar angle of this

bond. Finally, ϕγ is obtained from the azimuth distribution of the bond between particles 15

14

and 16. In a freely rotating molecule, α is uniformly distributed in (

π, π), cos β in (

1, 1),

−

and γ in (

π, π), resulting in a combined conformational space volume for rigid rotation of

−

ϕαϕcos βϕγ = 8π2.

Figure 2 shows our results for V (2)

1 with the same energy bin size ∆E used to construct

the histogram. The coarse-graining volume Γ0 = ∆x∆y∆z has been obtained by deﬁning

∆x = (xmax −
largest values of x15, the x coordinate of particle 15, for each particular energy bin. We

xmin)/δ, and similarly for ∆y and ∆z. xmin and xmax are the smallest and

present our results for a range of values of δ in Fig. 2. If δ is too large, the coarse-graining

volume is small, and the number of conﬁgurations for a given energy nt(E) is also small.

As discussed in Section III, this leads to underestimate the accessible volume. The value of

is seen to increase with decreasing δ, becomes approximately independent of δ in some

range, and then further increases with decreasing δ. If δ is too small, the shape of the region

being sampled cannot be accurately reproduced with this coarse Γ0. Note that the values

at low energies are the most diﬃcult to estimate, presumably because the shape of

the region in conﬁguration space is not as smooth as that at higher energies. However since

the procedure leading to the computation of the reference entropy relies only on the region

of high energies, this inaccuracy does not represent a signiﬁcant limitation to our results.

The behavior just described is qualitatively similar to that shown in Fig. 3 corresponding

to the rotation volume ϕαϕcos βϕγ. In this case we deﬁne Γ0 = ∆α∆(cos β)∆γ with the same

deﬁnition of ∆α, ∆(cos β) and ∆γ in terms of the quantity δ. The ﬁgure also shows (solid

line) the value 8π2 that corresponds to free rotation of chain 2 relative to chain 1. As can

V (2)
1

of V (2)
1

be seen from the ﬁgure, the values obtained approach this limit at high energies.

The constant S0 of Eq. (7) required to place both the monomer and dimer free energies

in the same scale is obtained directly from Eqs. (5) and (6), as shown in Fig. 4. In this

ﬁgure we plot SD,int(E) + S0 and 2SM,int(E/2) with S0 adjusted graphically so that the two

curves coincide at large E. Note that both curves superimpose to a good accuracy for a

range of energies, indicating the consistency of the approach.

We show next our results for Kx in Fig. 5, with Kx deﬁned in Eq. (9), as a function of

15

the dimensionless temperature. When Kx = 1 the mol fractions of the monomer and dimer

forms are equal (xM = xD = 0.5). At low temperatures Kx > 1, indicating a prevalence of

the dimer form, and the reverse is true at high temperatures. For the sake of illustration, the

ﬁgure shows the values of Kx at two diﬀerent concentrations c0 = 10 µM and c0 = 1 mM.

It is also intersting to examine the contact map of the dimer phase as given by the

simulation. As discussed above, the only constraint in the simulation is that there be at

least one contact between the two chains. Therefore the question arises as to whether

the dimer retains a signiﬁcant fraction of native contacts in the vicinity of the transition

temperature, or whether there is a signiﬁcant fraction of out of register dimer conﬁgurations

that are structurally very diﬀerent from the native state. In order to answer this question,

we proceed as follows: A contact between residues belonging to diﬀerent chains is considered

native if it appears in the contact map of the native protein in its lattice representation.

With this deﬁnition, GCN4 has 10 inter chain native contacts. We then calculate the

ensemble average of the fraction of conﬁgurations that have at least 50 % native contacts.

The results are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of temperature. This fraction approaches one

at low temperature, changes quickly around the transition region, decaying to zero at high

tempertures. We also shown in this ﬁgure the equilibrium mol fraction of the dimer form

for the same two concentrations shown in Fig. 5. From the ﬁgure, we conclude that in this

range of physiological concentrations, the decrease in the fraction of native contacts as given

by our model can be mainly attributed to the appearance of the monomer form, and not to

a signiﬁcant contribution from out of register dimers.

To conclude, our results show that it is possible to calculate the entropy loss of dimer-

ization corresponding to the GCN4 monomer-dimer equilibrium without any restrictions to

the motion of the individual chains. Previous research on this system diﬀered from ours in

that the entropy loss was estimated by restricting the conformation space of the dimer, thus

resulting in low values of the entropy (compare the value of V (2)

1 = 67.6˚A3 given in Table 1

of ref. [2], and the values shown in Fig. 2). Despite the fact that we have allowed sampling

of the full conformational space of the dimer, the results obtained conﬁrm that it is possible

16

to obtain the free energy of dimerization of GCN4 at physiological concentrations by using

a reduced model of the protein and Monte Carlo simulations.

APPENDIX A: LATTICE PROTEIN MODEL AND INTERACTION FORCE

PARAMETERS

The model protein used in this work employs a reduced representation of the protein

backbone on a regular lattice. The model comprises a sequence of bonds connecting particles

located at the center of mass of the corresponding residue and backbone α carbon. The

particles are then placed in a three dimensional simple cubic lattice with spacing of 1.45 ˚A.

Further details on this model can be found in ref. [15]

A sequence of conﬁgurations is generated by a Monte Carlo scheme with Metropolis

updating. The method employs three diﬀerent types of individual transitions. In the ﬁrst

case, a single particle and its two corresponding bonds are selected for an attempted update.

The second type of transition involves three consecutive bonds and the corresponding two

adjacent particles. The third involves a rigid translation of a small fragment of the chain

comprising three particles, and the ensuing rearrangement of the end bonds. These tran-

sitions are attempted sequentially for all the bonds in the chain. Two separate transitions

are also included to adjust the position of the N- and C-termini particles. The set of all

these attempted transitions constitutes a Monte Carlo step (MCS). Further details about

the transitions used in the Monte Carlo updating can be found in ref. [22].

Interaction forces can be grouped into generic and sequence speciﬁc. The former are

sequence independent and lead to protein-like packing, whereas the latter are derived from

a statistical analysis of the protein database, and explicitly depend on the identity of the

aminoacids involved. We next list the values of the various parameters used in our calcula-

tions. Sequence dependent short range interactions are deﬁned by Eq. (1) of [22]. We use

a common multiplicative factor in our calculations εshort = 0.325 (this factor is explicitly

shown in Eq. (12) of [15] with a value of 0.75 instead). A three-body potential that is

sequence speciﬁc is also used, with an amplitude ε3b = 0.25. The generic, short range con-

formational biases of Eqs. (3), (4), and (5) of [15] involve εgen = 1.25. Hydrogen bonding

energies within the main chain are also included, with an amplitude εH−bond = 0.325 in Eq.

20

(7) of [15]. Long range and sequence dependent interactions are modeled by a set of square

well potentials as described in Eq. (9) of [15]. We have chosen Erep = 4 in Eq. (8) of that

reference, and a common multiplicative factor εpair = 2.0 (to be compared with the factor

of 1.25 in Eq. (12) of [15]). Two additional multibody potentials are introduced to include

hydrophobic eﬀects, and preferences for parallel or anti-parallel packing among the residues.

We deﬁne as the scale of Eq. (10) in [15] εsurf ace = 0.75 (instead of the value 0.5 shown in

Eq. (12) of that reference). Finally, we have used a factor εmulti = 0.75 in Eq. (11) of [15]

(instead of the value 0.5 in Eq. (12)).

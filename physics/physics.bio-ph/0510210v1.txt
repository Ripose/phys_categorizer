Abstract

The optical scattering coeﬃcient of a dilute, well solubilised eume-
lanin solution has been accurately measured as a function of incident
wavelength, and found to contribute less than 6% of the total optical
attenuation between 210 and 325nm. At longer wavelengths (325nm
to 800nm) the scattering was less than the minimum sensitivity of
our instrument. This indicates that UV and visible optical density
spectra can be interpreted as true absorption with a high degree of
conﬁdence. The scattering coeﬃcient vs wavelength was found to be
consistent with Rayleigh Theory for a particle radius of 38 ± 1nm.

1 Introduction

Melanin is a biological pigment found in the skin, hair and eyes of many
species, including humans. It is thought to be a photoprotectant, but para-
doxically has also been implicated in the chain of events that lead to melanoma
skin cancer [1, 2, 3]. Of the two types found in human skin (eumelanin and
pheomelanin) eumelanin is the most common, and the most extensively stud-
ied. Eumelanin is known to be a macromolecule of DHI (dihydroxyindole)
and DHICA (dihydroxyindole-carboxylic acid), but the nature of the sec-
ondary structure (i.e. the supramolecular organisation) is not known.

Likely related to its photoprotective role, eumelanin has a broadband
absorption spectrum that increases exponentially towards the ultraviolet.
This is a highly unusual feature; most biological pigments exhibit distinct
absorption bands. The origin of the broadband absorption spectrum of eu-
melanin has long been the topic of scientiﬁc debate, which continues to this
day. Galvao and Caldas have used Huckel Theory to attempt to reproduce
the broadband shape, with some success [4, 5, 6]. More recently, Density
Functional Theory has been used to predict the optical properties of small
eumelanin oliogmers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. This has lead to the theory that
eumelanin may in fact be a collection of diﬀerent small oligomers of varying
electronic structure. The broadband absorption of eumelanin may then be
due to the summation of these individual spectra [7, 10, 11]. This idea was
recently extended by the suggestion that the broadband absorption may be
due to extreme chemical disorder [14, 15].

Wolbarsht ﬁrst suggested that the broadband absorption spectrum may
be due to scattering, rather than electronic or physical properties of the
eumelanin itself [16]. He noted that Rayleigh scattering would reproduce
the broadband spectrum, and account for the increase in optical density
at short wavelengths. This has very serious implications; if the measured
shape of the absorption spectrum is dominated by scattering then great care
must be taken when calculating optical properties. Despite several studies
on the topic, optical scattering remains a signiﬁcant concern. The published
literature on the scattering of eumelanin solutions is sparse and not cohesive,
hence it is useful at this point to brieﬂy review past work.

The importance of optical scattering was noted by Nofsinger and Simon
when they discovered that the shape of the eumelanin absorption spectrum
is strongly dependant upon the particle size [2, 17]. Since scattering inten-
sity is very strongly dependant upon particle size this could indicate that the
optical density of eumelanin is dominated by scattering. To test this, they
conducted photoacoustic measurments which suggested that the measured
optical density was not dominated by scattering for wavelengths longer than
400nm for any particle size fraction [2]. An earlier photoacoustic calorimetry
measurement by Forest and Simon similarly suggested that scattering con-
tributes no more than 15% of the total light extinction at 350nm [18]. Hence
Nofsinger and Simon concluded that the observed dependance upon particle
size was due to electronic and physical properties of the eumelanin.

Recently, a number of optical emission and excitation studies have been
published, which report accurate quantitative measurement of key properties

2

such as the radiative quantum yield as a function of wavelength [19, 20, 21,
22, 23]. Such studies provide valuable insight into energy absorption and
dissipation mechanisms, as well as shedding light on the structural question.
These measurements require the assumption that scattering is negligible. If
this is not the case, the scattering coeﬃcient should be measured and sub-
tracted from the optical density to obtain the true absorption. This was
attempted by Krysciak, who directly measured the optical scattering from a
dilute eumelanin solution as a function of wavelength [24]. He found scatter-
ing to be negligible between 500 and 700nm, but also discovered the puzzling
result of ‘negative scattering’ at shorter wavelengths. He suggested that this
was due to multiple scattering events and absorption (which becomes very
large at shorter wavelengths) decreasing the measured scattering below the
previously measured baseline. Krysciak’s results were non-conclusive, neither
conﬁrming nor excluding the prescence of scattering at optical wavelengths.
The following year, Kurtz reported on a theoretical prediction of the
relative contributions of scattering and absorption to the optical density of
eumelanin [25]. He found that in the Rayleigh regime (particle radii much
less than the wavelength) absorption dominated over scattering, whereas for
larger particles the two contributed equally. He emphasised the very strong
dependance of scattering on particle size. The importance of this is exper-
imentally apparent in a 2001 study by Sardar et al. where scattering and
absorption coeﬃcients were measured at four optical wavelengths between
633nm and 476nm [26]. They found that scattering far outweighed absorp-
tion at all wavelengths, contributing more than 99% of the optical density at
633nm. This result contradicts all previous studies, and is almost certainly
due to the sample preparation, which resulted in what was described as ‘a
brown turbid suspension’. The authors state that the eumelanin particles
were not solubilised and remained a particulate suspension. Under these
conditions, the particle sizes would most likely be much larger than those in
the well solubilised, dilute solutions typically used for spectroscopic studies
[19, 20, 17, 2, 21, 22].

Other studies have attempted to use alternative methods to measure the
absorption of eumelanin in the absence of scattering eﬀects. Caiti et al. used
photoacoustic phase angle spectroscopy of powdered melanins in the dry state
[27]. This technique is insensitive to scattering, and conﬁrmed unambigu-
ously the decrease in the absorption of melanins with increasing wavelength.
Unfortunately, the phase spectra do not correspond by visual inspection to
absorption spectra, and interpretation remains diﬃcult. Therefore, while

3

this study sheds doubt on the Wolbarsht model, it does not allow correction
of absorption spectra for scattering eﬀects in a quantitative way. Similarly,
a recent study by Albuquerque et al. used photopyroelectric spectroscopy to
measure the optical absorption coeﬃcient of eumelanin in the solid state [28].
Again, the decrease in absorption with increasing wavelength was conﬁrmed,
although a direct comparison with solution measurements could not be made
due to the diﬀerent properties of the system. Interestingly, a band gap was
observed at 1.70eV (730nm), which is possibly hidden in solution spectra by
scattering.

A careful study by Vitkin et al.

in 1994 gives the most quantitative
estimate available of the scattering coeﬃcient of a eumelanin solution [29].
Vitkin et al. conducted photometric measurements with a double integrating
sphere system at 580nm and 633nm. They found that scattering contributed
12% and 13.5% of the total attenuation coeﬃcient at each wavelength re-
spectively. These values, while small, are enough to introduce signiﬁcant
error in the measurement of the radiative quantum yield and other optical
parameters, and should ideally be corrected for. A measurement of the scat-
tering coeﬃcient as a function of wavelength would allow the subtraction of
scattering eﬀects from the optical density spectrum to achieve this.

If the scattering coeﬃcient as a function of wavelength were known, the
shape of the scattering spectrum could be compared with Rayleigh Theory.
As stated earlier, there remains debate as to the secondary structure of eume-
lanin: heteropolymer or nanoaggregate [13, 12]. This is a most fundamental
question, since it inﬂuences the interpretation of many other experiments.
Since Rayleigh scattering is strongly dependant upon particle size, these scat-
tering measurements can also be used to determine a fundamental particle
size of eumelanin in solution. Hence we have conducted an integrated scat-
tering measurement as a function of wavelength over the ultraviolet range,
where scattering eﬀects should be most signiﬁcant.

In addition, the solutions used by Vitkin et al. (0.07% to 0.12% eumelanin
by weight) were more concentrated than those best suited to photolumines-
cence measurements. The broadband absorption spectrum of eumelanin gives
rise to signiﬁcant reabsorption and inner ﬁlter eﬀects at concentrations above
0.0025% by weight [19, 20]. Although scattering should scale linearly with
concentration it is feasible that there is less aggregation at lower concentra-
tions, giving rise to less scattering. Hence we have made a direct measure-
ment of the scattering coeﬃcient at the ideal spectroscopic concentration.

In this study we:

4

1. Measure the integrated scattering from an optical spectroscopy grade
eumelanin solution as a function of wavelength from 210nm to 325nm

2. Develop general equations to calculate the scattering in broadband ab-
sorbing samples, and apply these to the speciﬁc case of a eumelanin
solution

3. Show that the measured scattering is consistent with Rayleigh theory,

and use this to estimate an approximate particle size

2 Experimental

2.1 Sample Preparation:

Synthetic eumelanin (dopamelanin) derived from the non-enzymatic oxida-
tion of tyrosine was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and used without further
puriﬁcation. The powder was solubilized to form a 0.1% solution (by weight)
in high purity 18.2MΩ MilliQ de-ionised water. This stock solution was then
diluted to a concentration (by weight) of 0.0025%. To aid solubility, the pH
of the solution was adjusted to approximately pH11.5 using NaOH, and the
solution gently heated with sonication. Under such conditions a pale brown,
apparently continuous eumelanin dispersion was produced. This is identical
to the sample preparation typically used for spectroscopic analysis [19, 20].
This concentration is usually selected since it maximises the weak photolumi-
nescence signal whilst minimising distorting re-absorption and probe beam
attenuation eﬀects.

2.2 Absorption Spectrometry:

An absorption spectrum between 200nm and 800nm was recorded for the
synthetic eumelanin solution using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 spectropho-
tometer. An integration of 2nm, scan speed of 240nm/min and slit width of
3nm bandpass were used. The spectrum was collected using a quartz 1cm
square cuvette. Solvent scans (obtained under identical conditions) were used
for background correction.

5

2.3

Integrated Scattering:

Scattering measurements were made using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 spec-
trophotometer with an integrating sphere attachment (Labsphere RSA-PE-
20 Reﬂectance spectroscopy accessory). The solution was contained within
a 1mm path length quartz cuvette that was placed at the front and back of
the sphere as shown in ﬁgure 1 b) and c) to measure the forwards and back-
wards integrated scattering respectively. Measurements were taken with a
scan speed of 120nm/min, a slit width of 4nm bandpass and 2nm smoothing.
Since the scattering intensity was very low each scan was taken ﬁve times and
averaged. The 100% reﬂectance intensity was determined using a labsphere
certiﬁed reﬂectance standard, as shown in ﬁgure 1 a). The solvent alone was
measured in both the front and back positions (ﬁgure 1 b) and c)) and sub-
tracted after absorption correction (described in the following section). Some
light was inevitably lost due to the non-zero size of the beam entry and exit
holes in the sphere, and due to the width of the cuvette. This loss, along
with the non-perfect reﬂectivity of the inside of the sphere was accounted for
by the use of the 100% transmission measurement as a standard. A short
path length cuvette (1mm) was used to minimise this loss.

3 Theory

Eumelanin solutions have strong, broadband absorbance, and all optical spec-
troscopic results are therefore aﬀected by re-absorption (attenuation of pho-
toluminescence) and inner ﬁlter (attenuation of the incident beam) eﬀects.
Although a narrow cuvette and dilute concentration were used to minimise
these eﬀects, it was necessary to perform a careful analysis to account for
attenuation of the measured scattering by absorption. We derive here a gen-
eral method for correcting for absorption eﬀects in scattering measurements
that can be applied to any strongly absorbing solution.

We deﬁne αsf to be the forward scattering coeﬃcient, αsb to be the back-
ward scattering coeﬃcient, and αs to be the total scattering coeﬃcient, such
that αsf + αsb = αs. The absorption coeﬃcient is given by αa and the total
attentuation coeﬃcient is given by αt. We assume that αa = αt − αs (any
attenuation not due to scattering is included in the absorption coeﬃcient).
Consider a cuvette of width d, with a beam of light incident from the left,
as shown in ﬁgure 2. By deﬁnition, in a small region dx the attenuation of

6

the beam due to each eﬀect (scattering or absorption) is proportional to each
αdx, and to the intensity of the beam in that region (I(x)). Therefore:

dI(x) = −αsf I(x)dx − αsbI(x)dx − αaI(x)dx
I(x) = I0e−αtx

which is the familiar Beer-Lambert Law, where I0 is the intensity of light
incident upon the cuvette. Therefore the intensity of light scattered forward
(Isf ) is given by:

Isf =

3.1 Correction for Absorption

We make the geometric approximation that the light scattered in the forward
direction will travel a path length of d − x to leave the cuvette (refer to ﬁgure
2). As the scattered light travels this distance through the eumelanin solution
it will be attenuated by absorption. We assume that attenuation is only due
to absorption here, and not scattering, since multiple scattering events will
still be detected. Let the ﬁnal intensity emitted forwards from the cuvette
(attenuated by absorption) be given by Ief . Using the Beer-Lambert Law:

To determine the amount of light that was originally scattered (Isf ) from the
attenuated intensity that we measure (Ief ) we combine equations 1 and 2 to
eliminate I0:

Isf =

αt − αa
αt

1 − e−αtd
e−αad − e−αtd !

 

Ief − Bf

7

(1)

(2)

(3)

where we must subtract oﬀ the background signal (Bf ) which is measured
from a blank cuvette (containing solvent only) to remove scattering from the
solvent and cuvette walls. This process can be repeated in a very similar
manner for the backwards scattering to ﬁnd:

Isb =

αt + αa
αt

1 − e−αtd
1 − e−(αt+αa)d !

 

Ieb − Bb

(4)

where Isb is the intensity of light scattered backwards, Ieb is this intensity
attenuated by absorption, and Bb is the background scattering in the back-
wards direction. Note that the diﬀerent form of the equation is due to the
fact that the absorption for back scattering is calculated over a distance x
rather than d − x, as shown in ﬁgure 2.

3.2 Comparison with Experiment

We must now take into account the actual manner in which the intensity of
the scattered light was measured. We deﬁne S to be the light received by
the detector as a percentage of the maximum light received with a standard
reﬂector in place of the beamdump (refer to ﬁgure 1):

S =

Irecorded
Imax

× 100%

Assuming the detector receives a constant fraction of the true scattered light,
and 100% of the light is scattered by the standard reﬂector in the calibration
test:

S =

× 100%

Iscatt
I0

(5)

where Iscatt is scattering in either the forwards or backwards direction. Thus
S is the percentage of incident light scattered by the sample. However, the
detected values are aﬀected by absorption. Let Smf be the scattering signal
actually measured (aﬀected by absorption):

Ief
I0
Since S is linear in I we can apply the recorrection given in equation 3 to
obtain Sf , the true percentage of I0 that is scattered forwards:

× 100%

Smf =

Sf =

αt − αa
αt

1 − e−αtd
e−αad − e−αtd !

 

Smf − SBGf

(6)

8

where SBGf is the background scattering signal measured in the forwards
directions. Similarly for scattering backwards:

Sb =

αt + αa
αt

1 − e−αtd
1 − e−(αt+αa)d !

 

Smb − SBGb

(7)

where Sb is the percentage of incident light scattered backwards, Smb is this
percentage attenuated by absorption, and SBGb is the percentage scattered
backwards in the background measurement.

3.3 Determining the Scattering Coeﬃcient

Finally, we must relate these to the total scattering coeﬃcient, αs. Combining
equations 1 and 5 and similar equations for backscattering we ﬁnd that the
total scattering, S = Sf + Sb, is given by:

S
100

=

αs
αt

1 − e−αtd

(cid:17)
Combining this with equations 6 and 7 we ﬁnd:

(cid:16)

e−αad − e−αtd !

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(8)

Since αa = αt − αs this equation has only one unknown (αs) and can be
solved (Smf , Smb, SBGf , SBGb, αt and d are all measurable). This must be
done numerically, since αs appears non-trivially on both sides.

4 Results and Discussion

Figure 3 shows the absorption coeﬃcient for a 0.0025% (by weight) solution of
synthetic eumelanin over the visible and UV range. It is typically broadband,
and in excellent agreement with previously published absorption spectra of
eumelanins [19, 16, 17, 24, 2, 30, 31, 32]. The measured scattering coeﬃcient
for the same solution is also shown, as a function of wavelength between
210nm and 325nm (calculated using equation 8). For wavelengths longer
than 325nm the scattering coeﬃcient was less than the minimum sensitivity

9

of the instrument. We expect that scattering will decrease at longer wave-
lengths; Rayleigh scattering, for particles with radii smaller than ∼ 50nm
has a λ−4 dependance, and Mie scattering, for larger particles, is indepen-
dant of wavelength. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the scattering
coeﬃcient is less than the measured values over the whole visible range.

The percentage of the total attenuation due to scattering (αs/αt × 100)
was calculated as a function of wavelength, and is plotted in ﬁgure 4. It can
be shown that the ratio of the coeﬃcients is equivalent to the ratio of the
intensities:

αs
αt

=

Is
Is + Ia

(9)

where Ia is the intensity of light lost due to absorption and Is is the intensity
of light lost due to scattering. Hence this quantity gives the percentage of
the lost intensity that is due to scattering. It can be seen from ﬁgure 4 that
scattering contributes less than 6% of the total loss at all wavelengths within
the measured range. This means that measured absorption spectra (total
loss spectra) of eumelanin can be assumed to be primarily due to actual
absorption, and used for interpretation of spectroscopic data without further
manipulation. This allows accurate determination of important quantities
such as the radiative quantum yield of eumelanin [19]. This percentage is
less than that measured by Vitkin et al. (12% at 580nm and 13.5% at 633nm)
and possibly indicates less aggregation in our more dilute solutions [29].

4.1 Prediction of Scattering Coeﬃcient

The scattering coeﬃcient appears to exhibit a dependancy upon the wave-
length (ﬁgure 5) which is suggestive of Rayleigh scattering, rather than Mie
scattering (which is independant of wavelength). Let us therefore determine
whether the measured scattering coeﬃcient is consistent with Rayleigh scat-
tering alone (no Mie scattering). As shown by Jackson [33], in the Rayligh
limit (particles much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light), the
scattering coeﬃcient (αs) for dielectric spheres of radius a with dielectric
constant ǫ in a vacuum is given by:

Na6
λ4
where λ is the wavelength of the illuminating light and N is the number of
spheres per unit volume. This calculation can be repeated with the spheres

Hence, knowing the way that the scattering coeﬃcient depends upon the
wavelength, we can estimate the size of the particles giving rise to scattering.
Unfortunately, it is nontrivial to apply this to melanins, since the structure of
the fundamental particles is unknown. This makes determining the number
of particles per unit volume challenging. Nevertheless, we can make some
assumptions about the structure to determine an estimate of the particle
size.

In the absence of a better structural model, it is a fair assumption that
eumelanin monomers form approximately spherical particles. The volume
of each particle will be equal to the number of monomers per particle (np)
multiplied by the ‘volume of a single monomer’ (Vm) which can be estimated
to be 1.2 × 10−28m3 [34, 35, 36]. Hence:

np =

Vm

The molecular weight of a dihydroxyindole monomer is 149g/mol. The
molecular weight of an aggregate will therefore be 149npg/mol. Let C be the
concentration of our solution in weight percent, such that C = 2.5 × 10−5
for a solution that is 0.0025% eumelanin by weight. Taking the density of
the solvent (water) to be 1g/cm3, 1cm3 of solution will contain C grams
of eumelanin, or C/(149np) moles of eumelanin aggregates. The number of
aggregates per cm3 of solution will then be given by:

The dielectric constant for eumelanin (ǫ) has been measured to be ≈ 2.72
at optical frequencies (633nm) [37, 38]. The dielectric constant for water (ǫs)
is known to be ≈ 1.81 at optical frequencies [39, 40]. Vm has been estimated
to be 1.2×10−28m3, as discussed above. Knowing these parameters we can ﬁt
the scattering coeﬃcient vs wavelength curve by varying the particle size, a.
Although we have used several very rough assumptions about the structure
of eumelanin, the particle radius is to the third power in the equation for
the scattering coeﬃcient. The scattering is therefore strongly dependant
upon the particle size and it can be determined somewhat accurately from a
measurement of scattering.

This was done over the range 210nm to 325nm where accurate scatter-
ing data was available, as shown in ﬁgure 5. The best ﬁt was found for a
particle radius of 38 ± 1nm. The good ﬁt of the data to Rayleigh scattering
theory suggests that we are in fact measuring scattering, and not another
phenomemon (instrumental or otherwise). This particle size is larger than
that predicted by Cheng et al. [34, 35], and possibly suggests that the pro-
tomolecules further aggregate. Larger particles were measured by Vitkin et
al., who report a particle size distribution for a similar sample preparation
that has most particles with radii in the range 10-70nm [29]. Hence an ap-
proximate particle size of 38nm is reasonable.

5 Conclusion

The integrated scattering of a eumelanin solution was measured as a func-
tion of incident wavelength, and found to contribute less than 6% of the
optical density between 210nm and 325nm. This means that eumelanin ab-
sorption spectra can be interpreted as actual absorption with a high degree
of conﬁdence, and allows the calculation of many other optical spectroscopic
quantities, such as the radiative quantum yield, without direct subtraction
of scattering [19]. Hence, as long as eumelanin spectroscopic solutions are
appropriately prepared and well solubilised, scattering is not a concern. The
scattering coeﬃcient vs wavelength was found to ﬁt Rayleigh Theory with a
particle radius of 38±1nm. This is a larger estimate of the fundamental parti-
cle size than those previously reported from X-ray scattering and microscopy
studies [36, 34, 35], and perhaps indicates that in our samples the fundamen-
tal particles have aggregated. This is consistent with other optical studies
[29]. Knowing the physical structure of eumelanin particles is essential for

12

interpretation of spectroscopic results, and therefore for understanding the
de-excitation pathways in eumelanin and its biological functionality.

1. a) Geometry for 100% transmission standard. b) Geometry to col-
lect forward scattered light c) Geometry to collect backwards scattered
light.

2. Cuvette geometry.

3. Total attenuation and scattering coeﬃcients for a 0.0025% (by weight)

solution of synthetic eumelanin.

4. The scattering coeﬃcient (as plotted in Figure 3) as a percentage of
the total attenuation coeﬃcient for the same solution. We see that
even over this short wavelength range where scattering should be most
signiﬁcant, it contributes less than 6% of the total attenuation.

5. The eumelanin scattering coeﬃcient, with the predicted Rayleigh scat-
tering coeﬃcient (from Eq. (11)). The best ﬁt (plotted above) was
obtained with a particle radius of 38nm.

Abstract

By use of a stochastic generalization of the Hodgkin-Huxley model we
investigate both the phenomena of stochastic resonance (SR) and coher-
ence resonance (CR) in variable size patches of an excitable cell mem-
brane. Our focus is on the challenge how internal noise stemming from
individual ion channels does aﬀect collective properties of the whole en-
semble. We investigate both an unperturbed situation with no applied
stimuli and one in which the membrane is stimulated externally by a pe-
riodic signal and additional external noise. For the nondriven case, we
demonstrate the existence of an optimal size of the membrane patch for
which the internal noise causes a most regular spike activity. This phe-
nomenon shall be termed intrinsic CR. In presence of an applied periodic
stimulus we demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exhibits SR
vs. decreasing patch size, or vs. increasing internal noise strength, respec-
tively. Moreover, we demonstrate that conventional SR vs. the external
noise intensity occurs only for suﬃciently large membrane patches, when
the intensity of internal noise is below its optimal level. Thus, biological
SR seemingly is rooted in the collective properties of large ion channel
ensembles rather than in the individual stochastic dynamics of single ion
channels.

During the last decade, the eﬀect of stochastic resonance (SR) – a coopera-
tive phenomenon wherein the addition of external noise improves the detection
and transduction of signals in nonlinear systems (for a comprehensive survey
and prominent references, see Ref. [1]) – has been studied experimentally and
theoretically in various biological systems [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. For example, SR has
been experimentally demonstrated within the mechanoreceptive system in cray-
ﬁsh [2], in the cricket cercal sensory system [3], for human tactile sensation [4],
visual perception [5], and response behavior of the arterial baroreﬂex system
of humans [6]. The importance of this SR-phenomenon for sensory biology is
by now well established; yet, it is presently not known to which minimal level
of the biological organization the stochastic resonance eﬀect can ultimately be
traced down. Presumably, SR has its origin in the stochastic properties of the

1

ion channel clusters located in a receptor cell membrane. Indeed, for an artiﬁcial
model system Bezrukov and Vodyanoy have demonstrated experimentally that
a large parallel ensemble of the alamethicin ion channels does exhibit stochastic
resonance [7]. This in turn provokes the question whether a single ion channel
is able to exhibit SR, or whether stochastic resonance is the result of a collective
response from a ﬁnite assembly of channels. Stochastic resonance in single, bio-
logical potassium ion channels has also been investigated both theoretically [8]
and experimentally [9]. This very experiment did not convincingly exhibit SR in
single voltage-sensitive ion channels. Nevertheless, the SR phenomenon can oc-
cur in a single ion channel if only the parameters are within a regime where the
channel is predominantly dwelled in the closed state, as demonstrated within a
theoretical modeling for a potassium Shaker channel [8]. This prominent result,
i.e. the manifestation of SR on the single-molecular level, is not only of academic
interest, but is relevant also for potential nanotechnological applications, such as
the design of single-molecular biosensors. The origin and biological relevance of
SR in single ion channels, however, remains still open. Indeed, biological SR can
be a manifestation of collective properties of large assemblies of ion channels of
diﬀerent sorts. To display the phenomenon of excitability these assemblies must
contain a collection of ion channels of at least two diﬀerent kinds – such as, e.g.,
potassium- and sodium-channels. The corresponding mean-ﬁeld type model has
been put forward by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 [10] by neglecting the meso-
scopic ﬂuctuations which originate from the stochastic opening and closing of
channels. SR due to external noise in this primary model and related models of
excitable dynamics has extensively been addressed [11]. These models further
display another interesting eﬀect in the presence of noise, namely so termed co-
herence resonance (CR) [12]: even in absence of an external periodic signal the
stochastic dynamics exhibits a surprisingly more regular behavior solely due to
an optimally applied external noise intensity. A challenge though still remains:
Does internal noise play a constructive role for SR and CR? Internal noise is
produced by ﬂuctuations of individual channels within the assembly, and dimin-
ishes with increasing number. For a large, macroscopic number of channels this
noise becomes negligible. Under the realistic biological conditions, however, it
may play a crucial role.

Our starting point is due to the model of Hodgkin and Huxley [10], i.e.
the ion current across the biological membrane is carried mainly by the motion
of sodium, Na+, and potassium, K+, ions through selective and voltage-gated
ion channels embedded across the membrane. Besides, there is also a leakage
current present which is induced by chloride and remaining other ions. The ion
channels are formed by special membrane proteins which undergo spontaneous,
but voltage-sensitive conformational transitions between open and closed states
[13]. Moreover, the conductance of the membrane is directly proportional to
the number of the open ion channels. This number depends on the potential
diﬀerence across the membrane, V . The diﬀerent concentrations of the ions
inside and outside the cell are encoded by corresponding reversal potentials
ENa = 50mV, EK = −77mV and EL = −54.4mV, respectively, which give the
voltage values at which the direction of partial ion currents is reversed [13].

Taking into account that the membrane possesses a capacitance C = 1µF/cm2,
Kirchhoﬀ’s ﬁrst law reads in presence of an external current Iext(t) stimulus:

C

V + GK(n) (V − EK) + GNa(m, h) (V − ENa) + GL (V − EL) = Iext(t) .

d
dt

(1)

Here, GNa(m, h), GK(n) and GL denote the conductances of sodium, potassium,
and the remaining other ion channels, respectively. The leakage conductance
is assumed to be constant, GL = 0.3mS/cm2; in contrast, those of sodium and
potassium depend on the probability to ﬁnd the ion channels in their open con-
formation. To explain the experimental data, Hodgkin and Huxley did assume
that the conductance of a potassium channel is gated by four independent and
identical gates. Thus, if n is the probability of one gate to be open, the probabil-
ity of the K+ channel to stay open is PK = n4. Moreover, the gating dynamics
of sodium channel is assumed to be governed by three independent, identical
gates with opening probability m and an additional one, being diﬀerent, pos-
sessing the opening probability h. Accordingly, the opening probability of Na+
channel (or the fraction of open channels) reads PNa = m3h. The conductances
for potassium and sodium thus read

GK(n) = gmax

Na = 120mS/cm2 and gmax

where gmax
K = 36mS/cm2 are the maximal conduc-
tances. Furthermore, the gating variables (probabilities) m, h and n obey the
two-state, ”opening-closing” dynamics,

˙m = αm(V ) (1 − m) − βm(V ) m ,
˙h = αh(V ) (1 − h) − βh(V ) h ,
˙n = αn(V ) (1 − n) − βn(V ) n ,

with the experimentally determined voltage-dependent transition rates, reading
[10, 14]

αm(V ) =

1 − exp[−(V + 40)/10]

, βm(V ) = 4 exp[−(V + 65)/18] ,

αh(V ) = 0.07 exp[−(V + 65)/20], βh(V ) = {1 + exp[−(V + 35)/10]}

αn(V ) =

0.01 (V + 55)
1 − exp[−(V + 55)/10]

, βn(V ) = 0.125 exp[−(V + 65)/80] .

These nonlinear Hodgkin-Huxley equations (1)-(4) present a cornerstone model
in neurophysiology. Within the same line of reasoning this model can be gen-
eralized to a mixture of diﬀerent ion channels with various gating properties
[14, 15]. An essential drawback of this model, however, is that it operates with

3

the average number of open channels, thereby disregarding corresponding num-
ber ﬂuctuations (or, the so-called channel noise [16]). Thus, it can strictly be
valid only within the limit of very large system size. We emphasize, however,
that the size of an excitable membrane patch within a receptor cell is realis-
tically ﬁnite. As a consequence, the role of internal ﬂuctuations cannot be a
priori neglected; as a matter of fact, as shown below, they do play a key role
for SR and CR.

The role of channel noise for the neuron ﬁring has been studied by Lecar and
Nossal as early as in 1971 [17]. The corresponding stochastic generalizations of
Hodgkin-Huxley model (within a kinetic model which corresponds to the above
given description) has been put forward by DeFelice et al. [18] and others; see
[16] for a review and further references therein. The main conclusion of these
previous studies is that the channel noise can be functionally important for
neuron dynamics. It particular, it has been demonstrated that channel noise
alone can give rise to a spiking activity even in the absence of any stimulus
[16, 18].

The stochastic kinetic scheme [16, 18], however, necessitates extensive nu-
merical simulations [19]. To aim at a less cumbersome numerical scheme we use
a short-cut procedure that starts from Eq. (3) in order to derive a corresponding
set of Langevin equations for a stochastic generalization of the Hodgkin-Huxley
equations of the type put forward by Fox and Lu [20]. Following their reasoning
we substitute the equations (3) with the corresponding Langevin generalization:

˙m = αm(V ) (1 − m) − βm(V ) m + ξm(t) ,
˙h = αh(V ) (1 − h) − βh(V ) h + ξh(t) ,
˙n = αn(V ) (1 − n) − βn(V ) n + ξn(t) ,

with independent Gaussian white noise sources of vanishing mean. The noise
autocorrelation functions depend on the stochastic voltage and the correspond-
ing total number of ion channels as follows:

hξm(t)ξm(t

)i =

hξh(t)ξh(t

In order to conﬁne the conductances between the physically allowed values be-
tween 0 (all channels closed) and gmax (all channels open) we have implemented
numerically the constraint of reﬂecting boundaries so that m(t), h(t) and n(t)
are always located between zero and one [20].

Moreover, the numbers NNa and NK depend on the actual area S of the
membrane patch. With the assumption of homogeneous ion channels densities,

ρNa = 60µm2 and ρK = 18µm2, the following scaling behavior follows:

NNa = ρNaS, NK = ρKS .

(7)

Upon decreasing the system size S, the ﬂuctuations and, hence, the internal
noise increases.

Before integrating the system of stochastic equations (1), (5), (6) numeri-
cally, the external stimulus Iext(t) must be speciﬁed. We take a periodic stimulus
of the form

where the sinusoidal signal with amplitude A and frequency Ω is contaminated
by the Gaussian white noise η(t) with the autocorrelation function

Iext(t) = A sin(Ωt) + η(t) ,

and noise strength Dext. The numerical integration is carried out by the stan-
dard Euler algorithm with the step size ∆t ≈ 2 · 10−3ms. The ”Numerical
Recipes” routine ran2 is used for the generation of independent random num-
bers [21] with the Box-Muller algorithm providing the Gaussian distributed
random numbers. The total integration time is chosen to be a multiple of the
driving period TΩ = 2π/Ω, as to ensure that the spectral line of the driving
signal is centered on a computed value of the power spectral densities. From
the stochastic voltage signal V (t) we extract a point process of spike occurrences
{ti}:

u(t) :=

δ(t − ti) ,

(10)

where N is the total number of spikes occurring during the elapsed time interval.
The occurrence of a spike in the voltage signal V (t) is obtained by upward-
crossing a certain detection threshold value V0. It turns out that the threshold
can be varied over a wide range with no eﬀect on the resulting spike train
dynamics. However, to account for the typical spike duration a time interval of
2ms has been used. The power spectral density of the spike train (PSDu), the
interspike interval histogram (ISIH) and the coeﬃcient of variation (CV) have
been analyzed. The coeﬃcient of variation CV, which presents a measure of the
spike coherence, reads:

CV := phT 2i − hT i2

A = 1.0µA/cm2, Ω = 0.3ms−1, in the absence of external noise Dext = 0 (solid

in the presence of signal for S = 1µm2 (b), and S = 32µm2 (c). The vertical
lines denote the driving period and the ﬁrst two multiples.

ratio (SNR) is then given by the ratio of signal peak height to the background
height (in the units of spectral resolution of signals).

We have analyzed the spike coherence in the autonomous, nondriven regime
(i.e., we use Iext = 0) as a function of the decreasing cluster size. Our simulation
reveals, cf. ﬁg. 1(a), the novel phenomenon of intrinsic coherence resonance ,
where the order in the spike sequence increases; i.e. the CV is decreasing, solely
due to the presence of internal noise. The fully disordered sequence (which
corresponds to a Poissonian spike train) would assume the value CV = 1. We
note, however, that near S = 1µm2 (optimal dose of internal noise), CV ≈ 0.44,
the spike train becomes distinctly more ordered! For S < 1µm2, the
i.e.
internal noise increases further beyond the optimal value and destroys the order
in spiking again. It is worth noting that for S < 1µm2 the model reaches limiting
validity; in that regime the kinetic scheme [16, 18, 19] should be used instead.
Such a corresponding study, however, has been put forward independently by
Jung and Shuai [19]; their results are in qualitative agreement with our ﬁndings.
Interestingly enough the
Next we switch on an external sinusoidal driving:
interspike intervals distribution is not aﬀected for small patch sizes, cf. ﬁg. 1(b)
for S = 1µm2.
In this case, the spike-activity possesses an internal rhythm
which dominates over the external disturbances. For larger patch sizes the
internal noise decreases and the periodic drive induces a reduction of the CV
as compared to the undriven case, note the right arrow in ﬁg. 1(a).
In this
latter regime the external driving rules the spiking activity as depicted with the
characteristic peaks in the ISIH in ﬁg. 1(c) at multiple driving periods.

Next, the focus is on the SNR in absence of external noise, see ﬁg. 2(a).
Here we discover the novel eﬀect of genuine intrinsic stochastic resonance, where
the response of the system to the external stimulus is optimized solely due to
internal, omnipresent noise. For the given parameters it occurs at S ≈ 32µm2.

(NK = 576, NNa = 1920): short dashed line through the triangles, S = 64µm2
(NK = 1152, NNa = 3840): dotted line connecting the squares. The situation
with no internal noise (i.e., formally S → ∞) is depicted by the dotted line.

For S < 32µm2 growing internal noise monotonically deteriorates the system
response. Under such circumstances, one would predict that the addition of
an external noise (which corresponds to the conventional situation in biological
SR studies) cannot improve SNR further, i.e.
conventional SR will not be
exhibited. Our numerical simulations, ﬁg. 2(b), fully conﬁrms this prediction.
Conventional stochastic resonance therefore occurs only for large membrane
patches beyond optimal size, and reaches saturation in the limit S → ∞ (limit
of the deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley model). Thus, the observed biological SR
[2, 3] is rooted in the collective properties of large ion channels arrays, where
ion channels are globally coupled via the common membrane potential V (t).

In conclusion, we have investigated stochastic and coherence resonance in a
noisy generalization of the Hodgkin-Huxley model for excitable biological cell
membrane patches. The spontaneous ﬂuctuations of the membrane conductiv-
ity due to the individual channel dynamics has systematically been taken into
account. We have shown that the excitable membrane patches with an obser-
vation area around S ≈ 1µm2 exhibit a rhythmic spiking activity optimized by
everpresent internal noise. In other words, the collective dynamics of globally
coupled ion channels become more ordered solely due to internal noise. This
new eﬀect can be regarded as the intrinsic coherence resonance phenomenon;
it presents a ﬁrst important result of our work. This very ﬁnding has also been
conﬁrmed independently within a diﬀerent approach by Jung and Shuai [19]
(see the accompanying paper). A second main result of this study refers to the
phenomenon of intrinsic SR; thereby the internal noise alone gives rise to a SR

7

behavior, see ﬁg. 2(a). Conventional SR versus the external noise intensity takes
place as well for suﬃciently large membrane patches where the internal noise
strength alone is not yet at its optimal value. We hence conclude that observed
biological SR likely is rooted in the collective properties of globally coupled ion
channel assemblies.

Abstract

DNA nanocompartment is a typical DNA-based machine whose func-
tion is dependent of molecular collective eﬀect. Fundamental prop-
erties of the device have been addressed via electrochemical analysis,
ﬂuorescent microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Interesting and
novel phenomena emerged during the switching of the device. We have
found that DNAs in this system exhibit a much steep melting transi-
tion compared to ones in bulk solution or conventional DNA array.
To achieve an understanding to this discrepancy, we introduced DNA-
DNA interaction potential to the conventional Ising-like Zimm-Bragg
theory and Peyrard-Bishop model of DNA melting. To avoid unrealis-
tic numerical calculation caused by modiﬁcation of the Peyrard-Bishop
nonlinear Hamiltonian with the DNA-DNA interaction, we established
coarse-gained Monte Carlo recursion relations by elucidation of ﬁve
components of energy change during melting transition. The result
suggests that DNA-DNA interaction potential accounts for the ob-
served steep transition.

1.Introduction
Studies on the physical chemistry of DNA denaturation have been lasted
for almost forty years [1-3].
In 1964, Lifson proposed that a phase tran-
sition exists in one-dimensional polymer structure. He introduced several
pivotal concepts, like sequence partition function, sequence generating func-
tion, etc., and established a systematic method to calculate the partition
function [1]. These allow us to derive important thermodynamic quantities

In 1966, Poland and Scherage applied Lifson’s method to
of the system.
conduct research on amino acid and nucleic acid chains. They built Poland-
Scherage (PS) model for calculating the sequence partition function and
discussing the behavior of polymers in melting transitions.

Another excellent progress would be the building of Peyrard-Bishop (PB)
model [4,5] for DNA chains. In PB model, the Hamiltonian of a single DNA
chain, which is constructed by phonon calculations, is given so that we can
obtain the system properties through statistical physics method. The PB
model has introduced mathematical formula of stacking energy, as well as
the kinetic energy and potential energy of each base pair. By theoretical
calculation, one can show the entropy-driven transition that leads DNA to
shift from ordered state to disorder one [6,7].

However, all these works have not involved the DNA-DNA interactions
because the subject investigated is DNAs in bulk solution, and the interac-
tion between them has ever been neglected. The main idea of this paper
is to inspect the inﬂuence of collective eﬀect on the DNA melting process,
primarily motivated by the experiment results of DNA nanocompartment
[8,9]. Under the enlightenment of Poland-Scherage model and Zimm-Bragg
model [10], we simplify Peyrard-Bishop model to meet a reasonable Monte
Carlo simulation by the elucidation of ﬁve components of energy changes
during melting transition. The result shows that the melting temperature
and transition duration depend on whether we take into account the DNA-
DNA interactions among columnar assemblies of DNA.

2.Experiment
Recently, we found that specially designed DNA array can form a molecular
cage on surfaces [8,9]. This molecular cage is switchable due to allosteric
transformation driven by the collective hybridization of DNA. We named
it ”active DNA nanocompartment (ADNC)”. Typical DNA motif designed
to fabricate ADNC comprises two contiguous elements (inset to ﬁgure 1a):
a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) whose array is responsible for a compact
membrane (ﬁgure 1a, right), and a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) serving as
skeleton supporting the dsDNA membrane, which is terminated on its 5 end
by a surface linker such as an alkanethiol group that can be tethered to gold
surface with a sulphur-gold bond [9] or an amino group that can be tethered
to SiO2 substrate with speciﬁc surface attachment chemistry [11]. Because
the diameter of ssDNA is much smaller than that of dsDNA, a compart-
ment with designable eﬀective height (heﬀ, 5 ∼ 50nm, commensurate with
the length of ssDNA skeleton) can form between the dsDNA membrane and
substrate surface.

Since ADNC is reversibly switchable, it is able to encage molecules with
suitable size. We name this phenomenon molecular encaging eﬀect. Both
electrochemical methods [12] and ﬂuorescent microscopy are used to sub-
stantiate the molecular encaging eﬀect and the reversibility of switching.

2

Once the closed ADNC entraps some chemical reporters, the surface concen-
tration (Γnc) of the encaged reporters can be determined by cyclic voltamme-
try or ﬂuorescent microscopy. Figure 1b shows the isotherms of the molec-
ular encaging eﬀect for ﬂuorescein (C20H10Na2O5). Figure 1c presents the
melting curves of ADNC. Using the encaged molecules as indicator greatly
sharpens the melting proﬁles for the perfectly complementary targets, and
ﬂattens denaturation proﬁles for the strands with a wobble mismatch. The
observation shows that single-base mismatched strands are incapable of clos-
ing ADNC on surfaces. The result is highly consistent to our observation
by electrochemical analysis [12]. These observations bring up an intriguing
question: why the melting curves exhibit so steep transition compared to
the case of DNA in bulk solutions or on a loosely packed microarray? We
try to address this question in this paper.

Worthy of mention is that the steepness of melting transition is use-
ful when the ADNC is applied to DNA detection [8,9]. First, it greatly
enhances the discrepancy of perfect targets and single mismatches. This
provides much enhanced speciﬁcity in DNA recognition, 100 : 1 ∼ 105 : 1 of
our system versus 2.7 : 1 of conventional system. Second, more sensitivity is
obtained with optimally decreased ambiguity. Therefore, the clariﬁcation of
the origin of the steep shape should help us to further extend the experience
to related ﬁelds or generate new techniques.

3.Modeling
Taking into account the directional speciﬁcity of the hydrogen bonds, the
Hamiltonian of a single DNA chain is obtained as following form according
to PB model [4-6],

Hy =

(cid:20)

Xn

m ˙yn

2 + w(yn, yn−1) + V (yn)
(cid:21)

where the yn is the component of the relative displacement of bases along the
direction of hydrogen bond. The stacking energy w(yn, yn−1) corresponds
to the interaction between neighboring base pair in one DNA chain

w(yn, yn−1) =

1 + ρe

−α(yn+yn−1)

(yn − yn−1)2

The Morse potential describes the potential for the hydrogen bonds

V = D(e

However, in this study, the Hamiltonian in equation (1) is not suﬃcient;
it neglects the structure of close-packing of DNA in ADNC. In our system,
one should take into account the interactions between the nearest neighbor-
ing molecules [13,14]. To model the interaction, one envisions the molecules

faces. Each DNA duplex carries the negative charge of phosphates plus a
compensating positive charge from the adsorbed counterions. Let 0 < θ < 1
be the degree of charge compensation, f1, f2 and f3 the fractions of con-
densed counterions in the minor and major grooves (f1 + f2 + f3 = 1). The
mobile counterions in solution screen the Coulomb interactions between the
two molecules, causing at large separations an exponential decay of the lat-
ter with the Debye screening length κ−1. The solvent is accounted for by
its dielectric constant ε. The structural parameters of B-DNA are half az-
imuthal width of the minor groove ˜φs ≈ 0.4π , pitch H ≈ 34˚A(g = 2π/H),
and hard-core radius a = 9˚A. We take the following form for the pair

|n| = 2. Since κnR > 3 and g ∼ κ, each of the terms in the sum de-
creases exponentially at increasing R with the decay length κ−1

n ∝ 1/n.

Figure 2 present a scheme of interaction between two neighboring colum-
nar DNA molecules charged with counterions on its surface. The distance
between two DNA columns in our simulation is about 30˚A and the helical
pitch of DNA molecule is about 36˚A. For brevity, we take the mean-ﬁeld
approximation that the pair interactions mainly exist between charges in
the same height.

4.Monte Carlo Simulation
Let t be the dimensionless variable to mark the time series of simulation
(t = 0, 1, 2 . . .) and T the environmental temperature. Assuming that M ×N
DNAs are on the ADNC, the position of each DNA can be represented by
its coordinates (x, y), where x, y ∈ N , and 0 < x < M, 0 < y < N . All DNA
molecules in ADNC have identical sequence with P base pairs. Therefore
there is the collection of M × N × P base pairs. The degree of freedom of the

The black balls with positive signs in the center represent the absorbed
positive counterions, while the little grey balls represent the phosphate car-
rying negative charges. Each DNA duplex carries the negative charge of
phosphates with area density of 16.8µC/cm2 plus a compensating positive
charge coming from the adsorbed counterions. We take the assumption that,
and the distance between them are approximately 30˚A.

system is also M × N × P . The position of each base pair is thus represented
by coordinates (x, y, i), where i ∈ N, 0 < i < P . We take that the indices of
base pairs is assigned from the bottom to the top of the DNA.

At the time t0, the state for an arbitrary base pair at (x0, y0, i) with
well-formed hydrogen bonds is represented as (x0, y0, i, t0) = 1. Contrar-
ily, the state of a base pair with decoupled hydrogen bonds is denoted as
(x0, y0, i, t0) = 0 [10, 19]. ψ(x, y, i, t) is a function of the time and the posi-
tion of the base pair. Therefore, the state of each DNA molecules in ADNC
can be represented by a sequence of digits. The number of all possible states
is 2M ×N ×P .

Figure 3: A schematic graph for a double-stranded DNA molecule associ-
ated with bool quantities to represent well-formed hydrogen bonds (denoted
as 1) and decoupled bonds (denoted as 0).

The simulation begins at t = 0, T = 0 ◦C. At each step, t increases
by 1, and state of base pair at (x0, y0, i) is inverted, i.e. ψ(x0, y0, i, t +
1) = 1 − (x0, y0, i, t). We assume that by changing the state of the system
for M × N × P × Z times, the system will approximate the equilibrium
state inﬁnitely. The change will be applied to each base pair for average
Z times. Z is determined by experience and should be reasonable. We
increase T by ∆T during the simulation. Therefore we have the relation
T =

M ×N ×P ×Z ∆T .
Whether the state inversion is permitted depends on the energy change

t

(∆Et) in each step. The possibility of the state change at each step is



e−∆Et/kB T

(6)

If the current state change is permitted, we keep up changing the system
state at t + 1. If the state change is forbidden by the possibility, the system
state remains unchanged at t and waits for another change at t + 1.

To achieve a relatively precise simulation, the change of the total energy
at time t + 1 relative to that at the time t is analyzed by ﬁve components.

The recursion relation of energy change in each step is written as:

∆Et = E(t + 1) − E(t) =

Xl=1

where E(t+1) and E(t) are the system energy for the instant t + 1 and t
respectively, and ∆El (l = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is the variation of the lth component.
The energy change depends on both the recursion relation of the base
pair at (x0, y0, i) and the states of its nearest neighbors. The global energy
variation is determined by the local states around the base pair (x0, y0, i).
Following analysis presents the recursion relation of energy changes.

4.1. The hydrogen-binding energy (∆E1)
This component of the energy consists of the Morse potential (equation (3))
and kinetic energy along the orientation of the hydrogen bonds. The binding
energy is independent of the states of its neighboring base pairs.

where J(J < 0) is the binding energy for each base pair that is in ’1’ state,
while the binding energy for the ’0’ state is zero to be reference.

4.2. The stacking energy (∆E2)
To simplify the calculation of the stacking energy shown in equation (2), we
take into account the states of base pairs at (x0, y0, i − 1, t) and (x0, y0, i +
1, t). Their states remain unchanged during the interval from t to t + 1. We
employ the periodic boundary condition (PBC) listed below.

(9)

ψ(x + M, y, i, t) = ψ(x, y, i, t)
ψ(x, y + N, i, t) = ψ(x, y, i, t)
ψ(x, y, i + P, t) = ψ(x, y, i, t)

Therefore ψ(x0, y0, i − 1, t) and ψ(x0, y0, i + 1, t) are both well deﬁned. The
stacking energy reﬂects the interaction between nearest neighboring base
pairs in same DNA, and it exists only when two nearest neighbors are in
’1’ state at the same time. We use the symbol ψ(x, y, i1, i2, . . . , in, t) =
b1, b2, . . . , bn to denote states in the same DNA for convenience, which means

8

(x, y, i1, t) = b1, (x, y, i2, t) = b2 ,. . . , (x, y, in, t) = bn.

where w is the stacking energy stored in two nearest neighboring base pairs
in ’1’ state.

4.3. Morse potential away from equilibrium point (∆E3)
We set ∆E1 = 0 for the uncoupled hydrogen bond at base pairs. However,
for a ’0’ state is next near to a ’1’ state in the same DNA strand, the distance
between two base pairs is so close that the Morse potential should be taken
into account. We assigned energy E to every two nearest neighboring base
pairs that are in diﬀerent states in the same DNA.

4.4. The eﬀect of excluded volume (∆E4)
The eﬀect of excluded volume in the nature of DNA phase transition is dis-
cussed in Fisher’s work [20]. The excluded volume eﬀect is connected to the
system entropy variation. The eﬀect is prone to separate two complemen-
tary strands in a double helix. We use F to represent the energy change
corresponding to this eﬀect. One should notice ∂F

∂T < 0. We then have

under every case when the state of a base pair takes inversion. The value
overhanging the double-arrow represents the energy variation when the state

4.5. DNA-DNA interaction potential (∆E5)
We have introduced DNA-DNA interaction in previous section. For each
base pair, we denote the state of its m nearest neighbors with λi, (i =
1, 2, . . . , m; λi = 0, 1). ∆E5 can be written as

where G is the interaction energy between each pair of ions. Adding ∆E5
to ∆, we will get the energy variation including the DNA-DNA interaction.

5.Results and Discussions
Following the equation (5) - (12), we could achieve a coarse-gained simula-
tion of the melting curves of ADNC as well as that of DNA in bulk solutions.
To perform the task, we choose suitable scale parameters to carry out the
simulation: M = 100, N = 100, P = 20. The values of M and N chosen
are much smaller than ones of the actual situation, which is up to 104 in the
experiment. Since we take the periodic boundary condition, the values of M
and N used do not change our result. The starting temperature is 0 ◦C, and
the ﬁnal temperature is 100 ◦C, with increment of 0.01 ◦C for each step. To

10

guarantee the system reaches equilibrium state, we take state changes under
a speciﬁc temperature. Each base pair has average 5 times to be changed.
At each step, we count the number of DNAs that is still hybridized and
calculate the percentage for dsDNA in ADNC. The simulation result shown
in ﬁgure 5 shows a steep melting transition (hollow circles), consistent to
the experimental observations. The simulated result without considering
DNA-DNA interaction show in ﬁlled circles in ﬁgure 5 also agrees with the
DNA melting curves in bulk solution. Comparison between the two cases
suggests that the DNA-DNA interaction greatly increases the melting point
of dsDNA chains.

Figure 5: Simulation results of melting curves for collective DNA molecules.
The ﬁlled circle represents the phase transition curve without considering
the DNA-DNA interaction, while the hollow circle is the counterpart that
takes into account the interaction. Parameters used in the simulations are:
J = −1900kB, w = −250kB, E = 850kB , F = −1650kB, ∂F
∂T = −10kB,
G = −125kB.

In conclusion, we have established a simple coarse-gained model to sim-
ulate the melting transition of DNA in ADNC. The result provides a reason-
able explanation for our experimental observations. Although the simula-
tion method discretizes the Morse potential and stacking energy proposed in
Peyrard-Bishop model, the result still present a comparable approximation
to experimental data due to our ﬁne treatment of energy changes during
melting transition. However, this work is only the beginning of insight-

11

ful theoretical investigation for the rationality of ADNC. In future work,
we will establish a more precise model to employ an extensive investigation
of phase transition occurring in ADNC as well as its derived DNA machines.

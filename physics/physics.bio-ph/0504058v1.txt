We present a model of bi-phasi vesile in the limit of large surfae

tension. In this regime, the vesile is ompletely strethed and well

desribed by two spherial aps with a fold whih onentrates the

membrane stress. The onservation laws and geometri onstraints

restrit the spae of possible shapes to a pair of solutions labeled by a

parameter τ given by line tension/pressure. For a given τ value, the

two solutions di(cid:27)er by the length of the interfae between domains.

For a ritial value τc , the two vesile shapes beome idential and no

solution exists above this ritial value. This model sheds new light on

two proposed mehanisms (osmoti shoks and moleule absorption)

to explain the budding and the (cid:28)ssion in reent experiments.

Introdution

The ell membrane is a bilayer made out of a mixture of lipid speies. The

membrane is both the boundary of the ell and an interfae inside the ell,

separating di(cid:27)erent ompartments. This soft struture is responsible for

many biologial properties.

Intraellular tra(cid:30) is also realized by mem-

brane strutures: a membrane vesile buds from one ompartment, trav-

els through the ytosol and fuses with another ompartment. Despite the

(cid:29)uidity of the lipid bilayer, the ellular membrane presents a lateral in-

homogeneity due the formation of dynamial mirodomains, alled rafts

(Simons and Ikonen, 1997). These mirodomains have been shown to be rih

in holesterol and sphingolipid (Brown and London, 2000). In vivo, the rafts

have not been diretly observed but their size has been estimated to be be-

tween 20 and 700 nm (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003). A entral question in mem-

brane biology and biophysis is to understand how this spatial organization

is used by the ell, in partiular to favor interations with proteins. Due to

their size and spei(cid:28) omposition, it has been argued that rafts play a role in

protein doking, signaling, intraellular tra(cid:30) (van Meer and Sprong, 2004)

or virus budding (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003).

Reently, a model system of Giant Unilammelar Vesiles (GUV) inlud-

ing sphingomyelin-holesterol domains was developed (Dietrih et al., 2001).

These domains, whih are supposed to reprodue raft omposition, are the re-

sult of a phase separation of the lipid speies (Veath and Keller, 2003). They

are more strutured than the surrounding lassial liquid bilayer but remain

in a liquid state. For this reason, they are alled "liquid-ordered" domains

whereas the lassial membrane is alled "liquid-disordered". A large num-

2

ber of studies have foused on the thermodynami of liquid-ordered phases,

in partiular the e(cid:27)et of temperature or omposition hanges on domain

formation (de Almeida et al., 2003; Veath and Keller, 2003). Multi-phase

vesiles are elegant and e(cid:30)ient tools to study the mehanial properties of

mirodomains. It an be used to understand how rafts bud and make daugh-

ter vesiles for intraellular tra(cid:30), but also how detergent addition an isolate

rafts from the ell membrane. Reent experiments have shown that liquid-

ordered domains an be separated from the initial vesile by using tubu-

lar deformations (Allain et al., 2004), osmoti shoks (Baumgart et al., 2003;

Bassereau and Roux, personnal ommuniation) or absorption of external moleules

like proteins or detergents (Staneva et al., 2004; Staneva et al., submitted).

Here, we develop a marosopi theory for the two last situations. Our model

desribes the budding preeeding the (cid:28)ssion where the liquid-ordered domain

is lift up from the liquid-disordered vesile.

Budding and (cid:28)ssion have already attrated many theoretial works for ho-

mogeneous (Jari et al., 1995; Seifert, 1997; Döbereiner et al., 1997; Tanaka et al., 2004;

Sens, 2004) or inhomogeneous (Seifert, 1993; Jüliher and Lipowsky, 1996;

Kohyama et al., 2003; Laradji and Sunil Kumar, 2004; Harden et al., submitted)

membranes. The models vary depending on the physial interations in-

volved but they are all based on the minimization of the bilayer energy

(Helfrih, 1973). Due to the non-linearity of the steady-shape equations, a

numerial treatment is often required. We fous our attention on multi-phase

vesiles slightly strethed, a situation often enountered in experiments. In

this ase, osmoti pressure e(cid:27)ets dominate and we show that the vesile an

be desribed by two spherial aps with an elasti juntion. The variational

3

proedure with surfae onstraints allows to (cid:28)nd two solutions for any ratio

τ = line tension/pressure less than a ritial value τc . The stable solution is

the one observed experimentally. An osmoti shok inreases the ontrol pa-

rameter τ and so destabilizes the stable solution whih may lead the system

to a omplete (cid:28)ssion of the nek. The ase of detergents is slightly di(cid:27)erent

sine it requires an energy model for moleular absorption in the membrane.

When detergent moleules are added in the membrane, they loally deform

the bilayer. Aording to Leibler's model (Leibler, 1986), these urvature

defets an be taken into aount by a term in the energy proportional to

both the average urvature and the onentration of moleules. Homoge-

neous onentration of moleules is favored away from the interfae between

domains. At the juntion, a onentration gradient appears. If the hemial

inhomogeneity is loalized at the juntion, the addition of moleules leads

to an inrease of the e(cid:27)etive line tension induing a budding and a possible

separation into two independent vesiles.

Our model explains qualitatively and even quantitatively the budding

and (cid:28)ssion reated by osmoti shoks or proteins absorption. It is a physial

approah based on ontinuum desription and its domain of validity ends at

the moleular level. Beause of its simpliity, extension and appliation to

other proesses may be ahieved easily.

2 Membrane desription.

2.1 Inhomogeneous lipid bilayer.

We onsider an inhomogeneous vesile onstituted by two lipid phases: a

'liquid-ordered' (lo ) and a 'liquid-disordered' (ld ). Both phases are in the

liquid state but the (lo ) domain is more strutured than the (ld ) phase due

to the following reasons: there are spei(cid:28) interations between moleules

(Li et al., 2001) and/or there is an optimization of biphili spae paking

(Holopainen et al., 2004). Steady morphologies and their out-of-plane defor-

mations are well desribed by the Canham and Helfrih's model with energy

for eah phase i given by:

F i

m =

2κiH2 + κ(i)
G

K + Σi

dS

ZS h

(1)

H

K

and

are respetively the mean and Gaussian urvature. The elasti bend-

ing rigidity κi and Gaussian rigidity κ(i)

G are expeted to be higher in the lo

phase. Typial values an be found for example in (Lipowsky and Sakmann, 1995):

κld ≃

20k

T and κlo ≃

80k

b

b

T. Values of Gaussian moduli are notori-

ously more di(cid:30)ult to measure but a reent study mentions values of order

0.83κi (Siegel and Kozlov, 2004). Although F i

m is a surfae integral,

the Gaussian ontribution to the energy is indeed a ontour integral alu-

lated at the interfae between the two domains, due to the Gauss-Bonnet

κ(i)
G =

−

theorem.

The last ontribution in Eq.1 is related to the possible extension of the

membrane. In the ase of a strethed vesile, this ontribution is large om-

pared to the elasti energy and the membrane surfae an be onsidered as

onstant. This is taken into aount by introduing the Lagrange multiplier

5

Σi .

The total energy of the two-domain vesile inludes the energy (1) of eah

phase plus two oupling terms. First, a sharp interfae of vanishing thikness

exists between the lo and ld phases. Any inrease of its length requires an

energy proportional to a line tension σ . Seond, the vesile membrane is

lightly permeable to the water but not to the ions or big moleules present

in the surrounding water medium. This indues an osmoti pressure P . The

energy of the oupling terms is:

Fc = σ

2.2 Proteins or detergent-membrane interations

External moleules suh as proteins or detergents an be absorbed in both

phases but with di(cid:27)erent e(cid:30)ienies. Their introdution in the membrane is

well desribed by a Landau's approah with an optimal homogeneous on-

entration φeq . Departure from this value or inhomogeneity of onentration

φ has a ost in energy, assumed quadrati to leading order. The energy ost

is given by two positive onstants in eah phase: αi and βi . If the proteins are

soluble or not in the surrounding medium, we an either set the number of

these moleules in eah phase or set the hemial potential µi of the phase i.

We hoose to (cid:28)x µi but this has no real inidene on the results sine it only

a(cid:27)ets the de(cid:28)nition of µi . Therefore the free hemial energy of absorption

for eah phase is:

The last integral in Eq.3 represents the loal distortion of the membrane

indued by the absorbed moleules (Leibler, 1986; Bikel et al., 2001). It is

proportional to the mean urvature of the membrane with a weight depending

on the loal onentration φ, as suggested by S. Leibler (Leibler, 1986), Λi

being a oupling onstant. The absorption proess itself a(cid:27)ets di(cid:27)erently

the two lea(cid:29)ets of the vesile. We restrit our attention to the ase where

the adsorption takes plae on one side only. In suh ase, Λi is positive on

the outer side absorption and negative on the inner side. When the two

layers are a(cid:27)eted by absorption, two onentration (cid:28)elds are neessary and

our theoretial framework an be easily adapted to address suh situation.

Taken into aount all previous ontributions, the total free energy for the

system is given by:

FT OT = F o

m + F d

m + F o

p + F d

p + Fc

(4)

The usual variation proedure to identify extrema of this energy produes

the so alled Euler-Lagrange equations.

2.3 Euler-Lagrange equations.

Minimization of the free energy FT OT gives the stati solutions for the mem-

brane. Looking for axisymmetri shapes, we hoose the ylindrial oordi-

nates and we parameterize the surfae by the ar-length s. The vesile shape

is given by r(s) and ψ(s) (see Fig. 1). We have derived the Euler-Lagrange

These equations have to be solved with the suitable boundary onditions at

the border between the two domains. To simplify the notations, we introdue

the following parameters:

˜Σi = Σi + αi/2φ2

eqi and ˜µi = µi

αiφeqi . Assuming

−

ontinuity of both the radius r , the angle ψ and the moleules onentra-

tion φ, the variational proedure gives also three equations for the boundary

Sine these equations are highly non-linear, there is no exat solutions

for arbitrary values of the physial parameters. However further analyti-

al progress an be obtained in the limit of large pressure (strethed mem-

brane). Remarkably, this treatment only requires simple analytial alge-

bra and allows to explain experimental features suh as the omplete bud-

moleules (Staneva et al., submitted)

3 Analytial treatment of the membrane shape.

We (cid:28)rst onsider a membrane without absorbed moleules. A solution of the

Euler-Lagrange equations an be easily found if we disard the ontribution

from the elastiity. We use this simple solution as zeroth order and orret it

for small but not vanishing values of the bending rigidity by using boundary

layer analysis. We onsider also the inlusion of moleules with no hemial

ativity. They are desribed in the model by urvature defets. For a weak

oupling between urvature and onentration, a similar strategy is used to

understand how the moleules a(cid:27)et the membrane shape.

3.1 The exat zero-order model: the apillary solution.

For strethed membrane without absorbed moleules (φ = 0), it is believed

that after eletro-formation of GUV vesiles the osmoti pressure dominates

the elasti energy. When κi = 0 in both phases, a solution of the Euler-

Lagrange equation is made of two spherial aps de(cid:28)ned by a set of four

geometrial parameters: the radii of the two aps R1 , R2 and the two angles

at the boundary θ1 and θ2 (see Fig. 2). The ontat between the two aps

gives a (cid:28)rst ontinuity relation

R1 sin θ1 = R2 sin θ2.

(7)

9

The Euler-Lagrange equations (Eq.5) give the values of the two Lagrange

multipliers Σi and γi , without diret information on the vesile shape:

2Σi = P Ri,
P R2
i
2

γi(s) =

sin ψ cos ψ.

(8a)

(8b)

(9)

the angle ψ being proportional to the ar-length s. Only the boundary on-

dition and the onservation of the area of eah phase give the possibility to

(cid:28)x ompletely the ideal shape. From Eq.6, we dedue:

R2

1 sin θ1 cos θ1 = R2

2 sin θ2 cos θ2 −

2σ
P

.

The shape is ontrolled by the redued line tension τ = σ/P (homogeneous to

a surfae), whih an be adjusted by hanging the osmoti pressure. As an ex-

ample, from the (cid:28)gure (1b) in Baumgart et al.'s work (Baumgart et al., 2003),

reprodued here in (cid:28)gure 4, we alulate τ = 20.5µm2

, from estimated values

of R1 , R2 , θ1 and θ2 . Notie that in Baumgart's work, label 1 orrespond to

the ld domain and label 2 to the lo domain.

Solving Eq.7 and 9 for the above τ -value gives two possible solutions:

R1 = 5.30µm, R2 = 10.5µm, θ1 = 1.34 and θ2 = 0.514, the measured

values (Fig. 3(a)) but also R1 = 3.97µm, R2 = 10.3µm, θ1 = 1.96 and

θ2 = 0.364 for the seond solution (Fig. 3(b)). In order to explain why the

(cid:28)rst solution is preferred in the experiment, we alulate the energy whih is

restrited here to two ontributions: FT OT =

P V + σl with l the perimeter

−

of the interfae. Using a typial length sale Lr = 10µm, it is possible to

onstrut the dimensionless energy

˜FT OT = FT OT /(πP L3

r). Notie that the

value of Lr does not a(cid:27)et the physis of the problem, it is used only to have

10

dimensionless lengths lose to 1. So we obtain

˜FT OT =

V /πL3

r + 2τ R1 sin θ1/L3
r,

−

(10)

whih gives respetively (-1.380) ompared to (-1.377), and shows that the

experimental observed solution is stable while the other one is unstable as

expeted.

A systemati study of the pair of solutions for arbitrary values of τ is

straightforward and the results are presented in (cid:28)gure 5. Figure 5a is a

lassial bifuration diagram when a pair of solutions appears with opposite

stability. In this problem, τ is the ontrol parameter and the energy

˜FT OT is

the order parameter. These two solutions di(cid:27)er geometrially, the unstable

solution presenting a smaller nek ompared to the stable one (obvious if

τ = 0) (see Fig 5b). As τ inreases, the two solutions beome geometrially

loser up to a (cid:28)nite value of τc = R1R2/2. Above the ritial value (τ

≥
τc ), there is no onneted solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations but the

solution with two separated spheres remains.

This bifuration diagram desribing hange in the topology of budding

spheres is similar to the one found in the atenoid problem where a soap (cid:28)lm

is (cid:28)xed on two parallel rings, separated by a small distane d ompared to

the radius of the ring. Two di(cid:27)erent minimal surfaes (with similar atenoid

shapes) satisfy the variational equations derived from the apillary energy.

The di(cid:27)erene between these two shapes an be measured by the perimeter

at mid-distane between the two rings. The atenoid with the smaller nek

is unstable sine its area is larger and, experimentally, the other atenoid is

observed. However, as it is well known, as the distane d inreases, the nek

size dereases, the atenoid is destroyed and is replaed by two independent

11

disks (Ben Amar et al., 1998) with topology hanges. This geometrial in-

stability is not reversible. At the (cid:28)ssion, the nek of the atenoid is not zero

but the analytial alulation shows that the two atenoids, the stable and

the unstable, have the same shape.

In our ase, we are faed with the same type of apillary instability where

there exist two similar solutions whose stabilities are governed by the energy.

As the ontrol parameter, here the e(cid:27)etive line tension, is inreased, the two

solutions merge and a hange of topology is expeted at this point. We do not

know if this hange is irreversible sine (cid:28)ssion requires mirosopi reorga-

nization suh as hemi(cid:28)ssion (Kozlovsky and Kozlov, 2003). Experimentally,

the daughter vesiles an remain onneted by a small (cid:28)lament of lipids but

if the two vesiles move away, the proess is of ourse not reversible. The

ritial value τc is determined by the fourth equation in Eq.9 whih gives

the equilibrium of the fores in the radial diretion (axis r). The term in

τ = σ/P is due to the line tension and its e(cid:27)et is to pinh the membrane.

The two others terms (in R2

1 and R2

2 ) are related to the pressure fore on the

membrane and are bounded. The ritial value τc is the value for the max-

imal fore on the membrane. For higher line tension (or smaller pressure),

it is no longer possible to ompensate for the line tension whih splits the

system into two independent vesiles.

One important onlusion of this study is the fat that small domains

are more easily ejeted. This an be validated or invalidated experimen-

tally when a vesile has several lo domains of various size. This onlusion

is opposite to a (cid:29)oppy membrane whose shape is ontrolled by elastiity

(Lipowsky and Dimova, 2003). To show this, we have varied the fration f

of the upper domain (label 1) and we have alulated τc using the data of

the experimental example (see Fig.6). Sine the two phases are equivalent

when elastiity is negleted, the results are the same for f and 1

f . The

−

parameter τc inreases with the size of the smallest domain. This result an

be explained by a simple argument in the limiting ase of a (cid:29)at domain on

a (cid:29)at surfae.

If the radius of the domain is r , the pinhing energy (due

to the line tension) is approximatively σr and the resistane energy (due to

the pressure) is approximatively P r3

. The balane of the two energies gives

. Therefore, it is harder to destabilize a large domain than a small

one. Next, we study the robustness of the model when elastiity is taken into

σ/P

3.2 The elastiity loalization.

Comparing the bending energy (Eq.1) to the osmoti pressure energy (Eq.2)

one (cid:28)nds that elasti e(cid:27)et an be negleted if κi << P R3

i in eah phase.

However, a disontinuity of the tangent appears at the interfae between the

two domains reating a singularity in the urvature. As soon as the bending

modulus is exatly zero, this disontinuity produes an in(cid:28)nite elasti energy

ontribution, loalized near the juntion, in ontradition with the weakness

of elastiity. We are faed with a lassial boundary layer model, as found for

example in the rumpling of an elasti plate (Ben Amar and Pomeau, 1997)

or the folding of an elasti shell (Pogorelov, 1988). For small but not zero κi

values, near the juntion, the elasti e(cid:27)ets smooth out the disontinuity by

loally modifying the shape of the membrane (see Fig. 2) on a harateristi

Using typial values for giant vesiles (Baumgart et al., 2003), we get le

10µm. Therefore, we an

model our system as two spherial aps slightly distorted at the juntion on

a distane of order le .

3.2.1 Fold desription

Far away from the fold, the spherial solution (denoted by S) is a good

approximation but not in the lose viinity of the fold better desribed by a

boundary layer (denoted by B) of size

˜le = le/Ri . We de(cid:28)ne a new arlength

parameter

˜l = (˜s

˜sJ )/˜le and we deompose ψ , r and γ into

ψ = ψS + ψB(˜l)

r = rS + ˜lerB(˜l)

; γ = γS + ˜leγB(˜l).

;

(11)

with ψS = θ1 or ψS = θ2 . The quantities ψB , rB and γB must vanish far

away from the juntion. Negleting absorbed moleules, the leading order of

Eq.5 gives

¨ψB = sin ψB.

This is the pendulum equation with solution:

tan(ψB/4) = tan(ψcusp/4) exp (

˜l).

The plus or minus sign is required for

As expeted ψcusp depends on the ratio of both rigidities. However, it an

not be easily measured sine the size of the fold is very small ompared to

the vesile size.

The parameter σcusp measures the strength of elastiity on our spherial-

ap system. Note that its ontribution is angular dependent. Elastiity

ontributes to the line tension and gives an e(cid:27)etive line tension ˜σ = σ +

σcusp . However, the total line tension is now a funtion of all the physial

onstants (σ , P , κo and κd) whih makes it di(cid:30)ult to estimate. Typial

15

values of the elasti line tensions are σcusp

10−14N/m (see Fig. 9), for

≃

10−13N/m. However, the e(cid:27)et of σcusp on the membrane stability is

σ

given by the dimensionless number

n =

σcusp

(P τc

σ)

−

whih measure the relative e(cid:27)et of the elasti ontribution with respet to

the distane at the bifuration point. In our ase, we get an important e(cid:27)et

with n = 38% and the ontribution of the elastiity to the total energy (about

4%) is not enough to a(cid:27)et the zero-order solution, but an be important for

the (cid:28)ssion of the vesile.

3.2.2 E(cid:27)et on the membrane shape.

The elasti terms an be taken into aount by de(cid:28)ning an e(cid:27)etive line

tension. Therefore, the previous results and the apillary solution are still

valid but with a new ontrol parameter given by ˜τ = (σ + σcusp)/P . Note

that the ritial value τc at the bifuration is still the same.

A variation of the ontrol parameter ˜τ modi(cid:28)es the angles θ1 , θ2 and ψcusp

and then the elasti line tension σcusp . The (cid:28)gure 7 shows the values of the

redued line tension of the fold (˜σcusp = σcusp/P ) versus the redued total

line tension ˜τ . The solid line is ˜σcusp for the low energy solution. The dashed

line is ˜σcusp for the high energy solution. The line tension of the fold must

be smaller than the total line tension σ + σcusp sine the line tension σ due

to the interfae is positive. Therefore, some shapes are no longer physially

allowed for the unstable solution. The (cid:28)gure 8 shows the energies of the

vesile versus the ontrol parameter ˜τ for the allowed solutions.

We have investigated the e(cid:27)et of the size f of the domain 1 on the

16

elasti ontribution. In the apillary model, the two domains are equivalent

and τc is the same for f and 1

f . The elastiity breaks this symmetry

−

sine the two domains are no more equivalent: the lo domain (here label 2) is

harder to bend than the ld one (here label 1). The (cid:28)gure 9 shows the elasti

line tension versus the fration f of the domain 1. Notie that the elasti

line tension is negative for large domains, meaning that the elastiity (cid:28)ghts

against pinhing.

3.3 Budding by moleule insertion

moleules are added uniformly. Eq.5 onnet the onentration of moleules

3.3.1 Fold desription

The interfae is the plae where strong gradients of moleule distribution are

found with typial lengthsale given by

lc =

βi
αi

r

whih must be ompared to the vesile lengthsale Ri . We fous on the ase

where lc << Ri so that onentration gradients are also loalized at the fold

in the elasti boundary layer. For distanes larger than lc , the onentration
¯φi that we hoose as unit in

of moleules is onstant and reahes the value

eah phase: so

˜φi = φi/ ¯φ.

Far away from the fold, the sphere (denoted by S) is solution but not in

the viinity of the fold, better desribed by a boundary layer (denoted by B).

As previously (Eq.11), we de(cid:28)ne:

˜l =

˜sJ )

γ = γS + ˜leγB(˜l)

and

The energy is the same for both phases. The sum of the two energies is pro-

portional to rJ , the interfae length, and de(cid:28)nes a new e(cid:27)etive line tension

σcusp .

The uniform insertion of moleules in the vesile modi(cid:28)es only the La-

grange multipliers whih have no diret physial ontent, despite the modi(cid:28)-

ation of the energy level of the system. The two-spherial ap zeroth order

solution remains valid without modi(cid:28)ation of the geometrial parameters

suh as radii and angles at the juntion. Therefore, we onlude that the

bifuration diagram remains unhanged, exept for the values of the energy,

with the same threshold value found previously. For τ

τc , two ideal solu-

≤

tions still exist, the stable one being observed experimentally. Only gradients

whih appear at the interfae modify the usp shapes and we need to evaluate

if they are responsible for a hange in the line tension value.

The equations (19) have no expliit solution but some interesting limits

an be onsidered. We fous here on three independent limits:

˜λe << 1,

˜λc << 1 and

˜lc << ˜le .

First ase (

˜λe << 1): the elasti oupling length is small. This limit de-

ouples Eq.19a at zero order, giving exatly the same solution as the ase

without moleule. Eq.19b allows to alulate the moleule distribution but

as the terms in

˜λe an be negleted in the energy (Eq.20), the e(cid:27)et of the

moleules is negligible. The elasti line tension is not modi(cid:28)ed by moleule

19

addition.

Seond ase (

˜λc << 1): the weak hemial oupling length. This limit de-

ouples Eq.19b, leading to

˜φB = ˜φB0 exp (

˜l/˜lc) with

˜φB0 the moleule exess

±

at the interfae, given by the boundary onditions (Eq.6). In physial units

and taking into aount both sides of the fold, we get for the inrease of the

line tension:

δσcusp =

√α1β1α2β2
2(√α1β1 + √α2β2)

( ¯φ2 −

¯φ1)2

(21)

The moleule absorption inreases the e(cid:27)etive line tension, whih may in-

due the (cid:28)ssion. This e(cid:27)et is only due to hemial gradients near the inter-

fae. It inreases with the number of moleules added to the system.

Third ase (

˜lc << 1): the ase of a small hemial length. The moleule

onentration has two very di(cid:27)erent lengthsales:

lc and le . The hemial

length lc ontributes to the juntion between the two domains and an be

treated as a boundary layer. However, the assoiated energy is proportional

to lc and is then negligible. For size larger than lc , Eq.19 beomes:

Taking into aount the (cid:28)rst and seond terms leads to the elasti line ten-

the onentration gradients β are negleted (Allain and Ben Amar, 2004).

This (cid:28)rst ontribution indiates that addition of moleules dereases the

line tension assoiated with the elasti fold but sine it does not depend on

the onentration it just implies a renormalization of the bending rigidity

(Leibler, 1986). The third term, proportional to

˜λe˜λc also dereases the line

tension but does not depend on the moleules onentration. Using physial

units, the last integral ontributes to the line tension by a term proportional

to the onentration of added moleules:

Λ1φ1(θ1 −

ψcusp) + Λ2φ2(ψcusp

It is positive when the moleules are inserted in the outer monolayer of the

membrane (positive Λ), whih is the ase found in the experiments. However,

if the moleules are added in the inner monolayer, it beomes negative and

budding and pinhing are inhibited. In onlusion, the net e(cid:27)et of moleule

insertion is a derease of the line tension at low onentration, then a possibly

inrease as the onentration inreases if the moleules are inserted from the

outer monolayer.

3.3.2 Budding proess

The absorption of moleules does not hange the zeroth order shape equations

of the strethed vesile. It modi(cid:28)es the shape of the fold near the interfae

giving a new ontribution to the e(cid:27)etive line tension. If the absorption takes

plae in the external lea(cid:29)et, it ontributes to an inrease of the line tension.

This inrease puts the system loser to the bifuration point ontrolled by the

parameter ˜τ = (σ+σcusp)/P and indues a budding of the smaller phase: as ˜τ

21

Figure 11 reprodues experimental results from Staneva et al. (Staneva et al., 2004),

inreases, the nek radius dereases (see Fig. 5b) and the small domain seems

to lift up. If the onentration is high enough so that ˜τ > τc , the budding is

automatially followed by a (cid:28)ssion proess, reating two separated vesiles,

one for eah phase. If the onentration is not high enough, the lift-up will

stop before the hange of topology. In the meantime, it is possible that the

vesile looses some of its moleules and retrats to its initial on(cid:28)guration.

This reversibility is impossible when (cid:28)ssion is omplete for two reasons: (cid:28)rst,

the system relaxes the Gaussian elasti energy and two daughter vesiles may

be energetially favored, seond due to thermal (cid:29)utuations, the vesiles move

away from eah other and the oalesene proess is unlikely. The fat that

the (cid:28)ssion ours proves that the time sale for (cid:28)ssion is muh smaller than

the possible rearrangement of moleules between the lea(cid:29)ets

showing (cid:28)ssion of a liquid-ordered domain indued by Phospholipase A

pro-

teins addition. The vesile is obtained by eletro-formation (the eletrode

is visible on the left of the pitures). It is omposed by a 45:45:10 mol/mol

mixture of phosphatidylholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM) and holesterol

(Chol). The vesiles inludes one liquid-ordered domain visible in (cid:29)uores-

ene mirosopy (not reprodued here): a small fration (10%) of the PC

is replaed by a (cid:29)uoresent lipid analog and is exluded from the lo phase,

whih appears as a dark irle. The proteins are injeted in the neighbor-

hood of the vesile by a miropipette (visible on the right of the (cid:28)rst piture).

Phospholipase A

ativity transforms the PC lipids into LysoPC, a onial

2

moleule, by utting one of the two hydrophobi tails. Fission ours about

10 seonds after protein injetion.

Similar (cid:28)ssion proess have been observed when detergents like LysoPC,

Triton X100 or Brij 98 are added in important quantities near a similar vesile

(Staneva et al., submitted). However, in this ase, the (cid:28)ssion is not always

omplete: the daughter vesiles may remain onneted by a small lipid (cid:28)la-

ment, as also observed in (Tanaka et al., 2004). This is not in ontradition

with our model sine the (cid:28)ssion proess requires to split the lipid bilayers

at the moleular level, whih is out of reah of our treatment. This level

requires a mirosopi desription as done in (Kozlovsky and Kozlov, 2003).

The (cid:28)ssion proess prefers small domains, as predited by our model. If the

onentration in detergents is not high enough or if the Phospholipase A

not ativated, the liquid-ordered domains bud without omplete (cid:28)ssion. It is

also possible to observe a relaxation of the vesile, whih reovers its initial

shape.

4 Conlusion

Our model explains why ejetion of a domain from an inhomogeneous vesile

an be ahieved by osmoti shoks or moleule absorption. It is based on

physial stability onepts in the spirit of the existene and stability anal-

ysis of the well-known atenoid. We predit a omplete irreversible (cid:28)ssion

above a ritial parameter. From a marosopi point of view, the omplete

(cid:28)ssion is favored, it dereases the total energy of the system at the threshold

of stability beause of the Gaussian energy. This (cid:28)ssion an be inhibited if

a membrane thread exists between the two phases. The existene of suh

a thread is out of reah of our approah. If it does not exist, the vesiles

separate from eah other. If it exists and if the experimental foring relaxes,

23

the two vesiles may fuse in priniple. The experiments disussed here are

in favor of a omplete (cid:28)ssion mehanism. For simpliity, the model is re-

strited to two domains of di(cid:27)erent sizes: extension to multi-phase domains

ompliates the geometry but will not hange the physial results.

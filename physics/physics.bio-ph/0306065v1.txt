We examine the dependence of the physical quantities of the rotatory molecular motor, such as
the rotation velocity and the proton translocation rate, on the chemical reaction rate using the
model based only on diﬀusion process. A peculiar behavior of proton translocation is found and the
energy transduction eﬃciency of the motor protein is enhanced by this behavior. We give a natural
explanation that this behavior is universal when certain inequalities between chemical reaction rates
hold. That may give a clue to examine whether the motion of the molecular motor is dominated by
diﬀusion process or not.

INTRODUCTION

Many kinds of molecular motors are known to play essential roles of life. The word ’molecular motor’ is, in a
wide sense, used to describe protein molecules that transduce chemical energy from some source into mechanical work
(and in some case, vice versa). Molecular motors are classiﬁed into two kinds: linear and rotatory motors. As the
former, myosins, kinesins, and dyneins, which slide along the speciﬁc ﬁlaments in the speciﬁc direction, respectively,
are known to work for muscle construction, transport of materials in cell, etc. by hydrolysing ATP[1, 2]. As the latter,
two motors are known to date. The one is bacteria ﬂagellar motor, which works as a propeller by gaining chemical
energy from the proton gradient across the membrane. The other is ATP synthase which is found in membranes of
living things. It works wholly as a transducer between the energy of proton gradient across the membrane and that of
ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate. It can both synthesize ATP and pump proton against the proton
gradient by hydrolysing ATP (see Fig.16-28 in Ref.[3]). It is composed of two parts, the Fo- and the F1-part, each is
known to work as a rotatory motor [4]-[17]. The Fo-part is embedded in the membrane. It contains a proton channel
and transduces the energy of transmembrane proton gradient into rotatory torque when working as synthesizer. The
F1- part plays a role of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, transducing rotatory torque into the energy required for ATP
synthesis and vice versa.

It is believed generally that the energy transduction eﬃciency of molecular motor, that is, the ratio of the energy
output to input from the energy source, is extremely high. For example, it is reported in Ref.[12] that the eﬃciency
is almost 100 percent for the F1-part of ATP synthase. Thus, understanding the mechanism of molecular motors,
especially that of energy transduction is important not only because of their many roles of life, but also because of
the possibility that, if this mechanism is novel, it may be applied to a new technology as a machine with high energy
transduction eﬃciency, even if it can be used only in a constrained scale. In the scale of motor molecule(∼10-100nm),
water molecules collides motor molecule so many times. These collisions make the diﬀusive motion of the motor
molecule and thus it is natural to infer that this collision eﬀect contributes to the motion of motor, but there is no
crucial evidence that it is essential.

Here we take up a simple model inspired by the Fo-part of ATP synthase[19, 20] and examine the dependence of
the rotation velocity and the proton translocation rate of this model on the chemical reaction rates. The eﬃciency of
energy transduction is calculated from these quantities. As far as we know, there is no computation of this kind.

II. MODEL

The Fo-part is schematically drawn in Figs.1 and 2. It contains three types of subunits, a, b, and c. As shown in
Fig.1, the a-subunit is ﬁxed in the membrane. The b-subunit connects the Fo- and F1-part but is not shown in Figs.1
and 2(see Ref.[3]). The c-subunits are arranged in a ring and this ring rotates accompanying the proton translocation.
There is a proton binding site in the almost middle of each c- subunit, Asp61, a carboxyrate. A proton passes through
the interface between the a- and c- subunits (but as described later, not directly), called proton channel. In the proton
channel, there are two paths to these binding sites, the left one is from the basic side, the inner side of the membrane,
and the right is from the acidic side, the outer(see Fig.2)[5]. Proton concentration in the acidic side are kept higher
than that of the basic side by respiratory chains, which pumps protons in the basic side out of the membrane. Roughly
speaking, a proton ﬂows into and binds to the right site from acidic side, goes through the membrane with c-ring

FIG. 1: The proton channel viewed from the basic side, the inner side of the membrane. There are the c-subunits arranged in
a ring and the ring rotates counterclockwise during synthesis. The position variable x is deﬁned as a rotation angle of the ring.

FIG. 2: The proton channel viewed from the a-subunit. There are two proton binding sites in the channel and only these two
can be either protonated or unprotonated. The left path of protons is from the basic side and the right path is from the acidic
side[5]. These proton binding sites move rightward during synthesis despite the leftward load from the F1-part.

rotation, and dissociates from the left site and ﬂows out to the basic side. That is, a proton passes through the proton
channel not directly but via the membrane accompanying the rotation of the c-ring.

We investigate the above situation using the ’(simply) biased diﬀusion model’ [19, 20]. It was ﬁrst presented to
explain the rotation of bacteria ﬂagellar motor which has similar structure to the Fo-part of the ATP synthase but is
one order larger in linear dimension. The mechanism is as follows: There are N proton binding sites in the rotor (i.e.
the ring is composed of N c-subunits and N =9-12 in Escherichia coli) at same intervals and two of them are in the
proton channel. Only two proton binding sites are allowed to be in the channel and each of them can be protonated
or unprotonated. The others can be only protonated due to the hydrophobicity of the membrane. Thus the states
of the motor are determined by the protonation of the two proton binding sites in the channel: E is the empty state
where both sites are unprotonated, R is the right state where the right site is protonated and the left is unprotonated,
L is the left state where the left site is protonated and the right is unprotonated, and F is the full state where both
sites are protonated. We assume that a proton does not hop between two proton binding sites. When one of the
proton binding sites in the channel comes to the boundary, it can move into the membrane only if it is protonated
and otherwise cannot due to hydrophobicity of the membrane. If there is diﬀerence from detailed balance between the
rates of one site at which a proton binds to or dissociates from it and those of the other due to the transmembrane
proton gradient, it become possible to take out a net motion.

Dynamics of each state is described by the Langevin equation,

where i refers to the state, γi is the friction constant, x is the position of the motor (see Fig.1) which is explicitly
deﬁned later. The potential φi(x) represents the load torque τ from the F1 part, so φi(x) = τ x [12]. Ri(t) is the
random force of Gaussian noise, which satisﬁes

+ Ri(t),

hRi(t)i = 0,

hRi(t)Rj (t′)i = 2Diδij δ(t − t′),

where h· · · i is the time average and Di is the diﬀusion constant satisfying the Einstein’s relation, Di = γikBT
(T : temperature, kB: the Boltzmann constant). The constants Di and γi depend on the states since the diﬀerent
conformations have diﬀerent surface areas, densities, etc. But for simplicity, it is assumed below that all the states
have eﬀectively the same values, γi = γ, and Di = D, since those diﬀerences are small. In addition to the above
single-state motions,transitions between diﬀerent states occur. Thus it is convenient to adopt the formulation of the
Fokker-Planck equation equivalent to Eq.(1),

where ˆf is the external force ˆf = diag[τ, τ, · · · , τ ]. ˆK is the transition matrix which describes changes between states.
The system discussed here has 4-component probability p(x, t) and ﬂow Π(x, t)

where pi(x, t) and Πi(x, t)(i=E,R,L,F) describe the probability and its ﬂow that the motor in state i is at position x
and at time t. The coordinate x is placed as follows: The origin O is set at the center of the c-ring and the position
variable x is deﬁned as a rotation angle (Fig.1). The proton channel extends from x = 0 to δ (δ = 2π/N and N = 12
ﬁxed hereafter). The position x = 0 is deﬁned that the left proton binding site is at the left boundary of the channel,
and x = δ is that the right site is at the right boundary. When one site moves into the membrane, another site appears
into the channel from the other side of the membrane. In this sense, the system has periodicity. These constraints of
periodicity and hydrophobicity mentioned above are expressed by giving Eq.(4) the boundary conditions,

ΠE(0, t) = ΠE(δ, t) = 0,

ΠR(0, t) = ΠL(δ, t) = 0,

ΠL(0, t) = ΠR(δ, t),

ΠF(0, t) = ΠF(δ, t).

There are a few assumptions in the above expression of the transition rate matrix : 1) The chemical reaction, that
is, binding and/or dissociation of proton to/from the sites, is suﬃciently fast compared with the motion of the motor
protein. This is justiﬁed because the mass and size of a proton is much smaller than those of the motor so the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of a proton is much larger than that of the motor protein. 2) There is no correlation between the reaction
of the left site and that of the right site. 3) The reaction rates are independent of the position of the motor x. This
assumption may have to be modiﬁed to take account of other inﬂuences, for instance, interaction between residues[19].
But we neglect the inﬂuences like these for simplicity. In this case, for example, it is thought that kER, the rate at
which state E switches to state R and kLF, the one at which L switches to F are both written by kR
in, the one at which
a proton binds to the empty right site. So similarly we set,

kER = kLF = kR
in,
kEL = kRF = kL
in,
kRE = kFL = kR
out,

kLE = kFR = kL

out.

and,

and

For the motor to work, the detailed balance should be violated due to the free energy acquired from a proton passage
of the channel, ∆G. Thus the ratio of transition rate from L to R via E or F to that from R to L is written as,

(L → R)
(R → L)

where ∆G is a function of ∆pH(∆pH = pHB − pHA, A, B denotes the acidic and basic side, respectively) and V , the
membrane potential accompanying this diﬀerence of proton concentration and written as,

Under these assumptions, this model can be solved analytically. The transition rate matrix ˆK is diagonalized by

the matrix ˆQ,

∆G = V + kBT ln[10∆pH].

The relations above are obtained by integrating Eq.(4) over x and using the boundary conditions (7)-(10). For the
ﬂow of probavility, the following relation holds,

which are obtained by integrating Eq.(5) with respect to x.

Let us now derive formulas for the observables; the average rotation velocity hvi, the proton translocation rate
N (H +), and the eﬃciency of energy transduction. The average rotation velocity hvi is given by the total sum of the
integrated ﬂow of probability ,

Using Eq.(28), we obtain

The proton translocation rate N (H+) is given as follows: When the state E becomes R, a proton goes to the binding
site from the acidic side, so N (H +) increases by +1/2. And when E becomes L, a proton goes back to the proton
binding sides from the basic side, so N (H +) decreases by −1/2. Thus ¯pE contributes to N (H +) as

We investigate the dependence of the quantities, hvi, N (H+) and e on the transition rate ˆK using the above
analytical solution. Parameters used for calculation are, according to Ref.[19], D = 2 × 104rad2sec−1, kBT =4pN·nm,
γ = 5 × 103rad2sec−1pN−1nm−1 and τ = −40pN·nm. The transition rates are given as

FIG. 4: The proton translocation rate N (H+). The solid line with +’s is the plot for pKa=4.5 and the broken line with ×’s is
for pKa=5.5. For pKa = 4.5, there exists a region where the increase becomes very slow (K ∼10-12). At large K, it diverges
as 10K/2.

where pHA = 7.0 and pHB = 8.4 are the proton concentrations of each side (A:acidic, B:basic, respectively), pKa
is the acidity of proton binding site, φ = 2.3kBT is the surface eﬀect, and V = 5.6kBT is the membrane potential
(the proton binding site is assumed to be in the middle of the membrane). The overall factor 10K means the proton
absorption rate of the path. Since it depends on the proton diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the surface area of the channel,
we assume that this factor is common value for all transition rates. Variation of K is also regarded as varying pH of
each side and pKa, preserving the diﬀerences of each other.

We plot the dependence of hvi, N (H+) and e on K in Figs.3- 5. For the rotation velocity, hvi, no qualitative diﬀerence
dependent on pKa is found. There is almost no rotation in the desirable direction when the chemical reaction rate
is low (namely when K is small). Then the velocity monotonically increases as K increases and saturates when the
reaction is very fast. For the proton translocation rate, N (H+), a qualitative diﬀerence dependent on pKa is found.
For pKa=5.5, N (H+) increases monotonically. On the other hand, for pKa=4.5, while it increases monotonically
also, but there exists a region where the increase becomes very slow(K ∼10-12). In both pKa’s, N (H+) diverges as
10K/2 when K becomes large enough. The eﬃciency, e, reﬂects the above results of hvi and N (H+). In both pKa’s, it
increases as K increases at ﬁrst. Then it reaches a peak value (at K ∼12 for pKa=5.5 and at K ∼13 for pKa=4.5) and
decreases monotonically afterward. The eﬃciency goes to zero as K diverges reﬂecting the fact that hvi converges to
the ﬁnite value but N (H+) diverges for large K. Note that the peak value of the eﬃciency for pKa = 4.5 is enhanced
and is about 25 percent larger than that for pKa = 5.5. This comes from the slow increase of N (H+) for pKa = 4.5
described above.

Inferring from the forms of Eqs.(23)-(26), the key to account for these results are thought to be the inequalities
j’s(i=E,R,L,F and j=in,out) and the reciprocal of the relaxation time of this

between the chemical reaction rates ki

convection-diﬀusion system, (γτ )2/D. The inequalities between ki
j’s for pKa=5.5 are diﬀerent to those for pKa=4.5.
For pKa=5.5, the inequalities are kL
in. Under the
parameters used here, which are plausible in living body, only the above two sets of inequalities are possible for the
model to work well. Note that the inequalities kR
in and kL
out hold since the proton concentration in the
acidic side are higher than that in the basic side and the diﬀerence makes the transmembrane electrostatic potential,
and also that kL

in is required for the motor not to diﬀuse leftward by the load torque τ from the F1-part.

in, while for pKa=4.5,kL

j’s do depend on K. And ki

While the above two sets of inequalities between ki

j’s do not depend on K, but the inequalities between (γτ )2/D
j’s which are larger than (γτ )2/D are relevant to the dynamics of the system. When
and ki
K is small enough, (γτ )2/D is the largest among them. Thus all the transition rates between the states are neglected,
so the motor does not work well. As K increases, ki
j’s also increase, and when K ≈9.5 for pKa=4.5 and K ≈10.5 for
pKa=5.5, the largest rate kL
out becomes comparable to (γτ )2/D. A proton in the left channel can dissociate before
diﬀusion and state R is created. Thus ¯ΠR increases and is the largest among ¯Πi’s in this region of K.

Next, for pKa=4.5, kR

out becomes comparable to (γτ )2/D when K ≈12. Near this region of K, a proton in the right
channel in state R can dissociate before diﬀusion, so state R becomes state E. Thus ¯ΠR decreases until ¯ΠE becomes
larger than ¯ΠR. As a result, the increase of N (H+) (= ¯ΠR(δ)) is suppressed in this region, but hvi does not because
the increase of ¯ΠE cancels out the decrease of ¯ΠR (See Figs.3 and 4). On the other hand, for pKa=5.5, ¯ΠR continues
to increase since kR

out. Thus N (H +) and hvi increase monotonically.
At last, when K &16, all the transition rates become greater enough than (γτ )2/D, so the matrix ˆM is reduced to

We show the integrated ﬂows of probability for state E and R, ¯ΠE and ¯ΠR, in Figs 6 and 7. Their behaviors
are consistent with the above explanations. We also see that ¯ΠF and ¯ΠL are much smaller than ¯ΠE and ¯ΠR under
the above two sets of inequalities (kL
in). (See Fig.8.) Thus the
qualitative behavior of hvi and N (H +) is determined by only the states E and R. This is also consistent with the
above explanation which neglects the state L and F.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

L , kout

L , kin

We have investigated the rotatory molecular motor using the simply biased diﬀusion model. The model depends
on four chemical reaction rates, kin
R , the diﬀusion and the friction constants of the motor, D, γ, and
the load torque, τ . We have solved the model analytically, and examined the relation between these chemical reaction
rates and the physical quantities, such as the rotational velocity, the proton translocation rate, and the eﬃciency of
the energy transduction. It is found that there exists an optimal value for the chemical reaction to maximize the
eﬃciency of the energy transduction. We also found that when the inequalities kL
in > kL
in
hold, the increase of the proton translocation can become very slow and the eﬃciency of the motor is enhanced. This
eﬃciency enhanced mechanism is naturally explained from this set of inequalities.

out > (γτ )2/D > kR

out > kR

R , kout

This model is based on the diﬀusion process like the thermal ratchet model for linear molecular motors[21], so that
the eﬃciency enhance mechanism above may give a clue to examine whether diﬀusion process dominates the motion
of molecular motor essentially or not. The inequality is controlled by the dissociation constant of the proton binding
sites, pKa, the proton concentration of both side of the membrane, the proton diﬀusion constant, etc.

The eﬃciency of this model is still not high comparing with that reported in Ref.[12]. There are some possibilities
which can explain this: 1) The deﬁnition of eﬃciency may be still vague and controversial. In Ref.[12], the authors
adapted a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the eﬃciency from ours. Our deﬁnition coincides with that in Ref.[18], where the
energetics of the Langevin equations and the Fokker-Planck equations are carefully analyzed. 2) There may be a
necessity to reconsider the several relations between physical quantities which we assume to be appropriate near
equilibrium, such as the Einstein’s relation, since molecular motor is a non-equilibrium system far from equilibrium.
3) There may be another mechanism which enhance the eﬃciency. For instance, an electrostatic interaction between
residues is discussed in Ref.[19]. Furthermore, experimentally conformational change of the motor protein during
motion is reported[22]. It is important to construct a model which gets along with this experimental result. These
may be the key to account for the high eﬃciency of energy transduction of molecular motors.

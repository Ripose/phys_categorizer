Summary
Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been implicated in the familial form of the neurodegen-
erative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). It has been suggested that mutant mediated
SOD1 misfolding/aggregation is an integral part of the pathology of ALS. We study the folding ther-
modynamics and kinetics of SOD1 using a hybrid molecular dynamics approach. We reproduce the
experimentally observed SOD1 folding thermodynamics and ﬁnd that the residues which contribute
the most to SOD1 thermal stability are also crucial for apparent two-state folding kinetics. Surpris-
ingly, we ﬁnd that these residues are located on the surface of the protein and not in the hydrophobic
core. Mutations in some of the identiﬁed residues are found in patients with the disease. We argue
that the identiﬁed residues may play an important role in aggregation. To further characterize the
folding of SOD1, we study the role of cysteine residues in folding and ﬁnd that non-native disulﬁde
bond formation may signiﬁcantly alter SOD1 folding dynamics and aggregation propensity.

INTRODUCTION

2

ALS is the most common motor neuron disease in human adults that is characterized by selective motor neuron
death [1, 2, 3, 4]. In approximately 10% of the cases of ALS, the disease is inherited, thus called Familial ALS (FALS)
[1]. Mutations in the cytoplasmic enzyme SOD1 were identiﬁed as the primary cause of approximately 20% of FALS
cases [5, 6]. More than 90 mutations have been identiﬁed so far. The FALS mutations are scattered throughout
the primary sequence and three-dimensional structure of SOD1, which exists as a homo-dimer in native state (each
monomer is 153 amino acids in length) [7]. One hypothesis to explain the toxic gain-of-function of the mutants is
that the toxicity is derived from intracellular aggregates and/or failure of SOD1 degradation, which is supported
by the observation that in both mice and cell culture models, death of mutant neurons is preceded by formation
In addition, SOD1 knockout mice do not develop
of cytoplasmic aggregates containing mutant SOD1 [8, 9, 10].
motor neuron disease [11]. Aggregation or misfolding is therefore a characteristic of SOD1 mediated FALS. Toxicity
may arise through (i) aberrant chemistry due to misfolded mutants [12, 13, 14], (ii) saturation of essential cellular
machinery such as chaperones and proteasome components [15, 16], or (iii) oligomeric forms of the aggregate may
themselves be toxic to the cells, as has been suggested for other neurodegenerative diseases [17].

Aggregation of proteins is mediated by a variety of factors including native state stability [18, 19], β-sheet propensity
[20], net charge and overall hydrophobicity [21].
In addition, folding and aggregation are kinetically competing
processes [20, 22, 23]. Thus, it is crucial to study the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of SOD1 in order to
understand the causes of SOD1 misfolding, aggregation and toxicity. A microscopic picture of SOD1 folding and/or
aggregation dynamics of SOD1 is not available from either theory or experiment. We reconstruct the SOD1 folding
mechanism from molecular dynamics simulations.

Neither the structure of SOD1 aggregates nor the mechanism of aggregation is fully understood. Several ex-
perimental studies have characterized the folding thermodynamics of SOD1 and the associated FALS mutants
[30] measured the stability of mutants in
[27] and Rodriguez et al.
[24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Lepock et al.
diﬀerential scanning calorimetry studies of the irreversible unfolding of the distinctly metallated species of the en-
zyme, and showed that mutants are destabilized relative to the wild type. In addition, a crystal structure of the
G37R mutant [31] shows higher atomic displacement parameters (B-factors) for the side-chains compared to the wild
type, but the backbone conformation is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, thus indicating greater molecular ﬂexibility in
some portions of the structure. It was recently shown that the for some mutants, the apo-state (without metals) of
the mutants is markedly destabilized compared to that of the wild-type, while the holo-state (with metals) of both
mutants and wild-type is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected [32]. It is, therefore, possible that the apo-state of SOD1 — the
subject of our studies — is implicated in misfolding and aggregation.

Most Cu, Zn superoxide dismutases, including human SOD1, have been shown to undergo irreversible aggregation
on exposure to temperatures higher than their respective melting temperatures. The presence of free cysteines —
those that do not form disulﬁde bonds in the native state — is known to be involved in this phenomenon.
It is
well-established that improper disulﬁde bond formation, concomitant with cysteine oxidation, possibly enhanced by
metals in SOD1, is a cause of heat-denatured aggregation [33]. In the case of bovine SOD1, substitution by site-
directed mutagenesis of free cysteine residues was found to greatly increase the reversibility of denaturation without
substantially aﬀecting the conformational stability [25, 27]. Yeast SOD1 [34] and E. coli SOD1 [35], neither of which
contain free cysteines, show partial and full reversibility respectively upon denaturation. However, SOD1 from P.
leiognathi also denatures irreversibly despite having no free cysteines [36]. Clearly, the presence of free cysteines is
one of the crucial factors (but not the only factor) responsible for irreversible denaturation. One plausible reason for
the eﬀect of free cysteines is that the formation of improper disulﬁde bonds makes SOD1 more prone to kinetic traps.
Therefore, we also study the eﬀect of disulﬁde bonds on SOD1 folding reversibility.

An atomic resolution simulation of the folding process using traditional molecular mechanics force-ﬁelds is diﬃcult
by direct computational approaches because of the vast dimensionality of the protein conformational space [37].
Simpliﬁed models such as the G¯o model [38, 39] provide a powerful alternative to study folding because of their
ability to simulate folding on reasonable time scales and to reproduce the basic thermodynamic and kinetic properties
of proteins both on- [40, 41, 42] and oﬀ-lattices [43, 44]. In the G¯o model, the energy of the protein is expressed
as a sum of pairwise native contact energies. A native contact exists between amino acids if they are closer to each
other than a cut-oﬀ distance in the native state. Thus, in the G¯o approximation, folding can be construed as a
transition from a state with no or a small number of native contacts to a state with all native contacts. Despite
their apparent simplicity, native topology-based approaches have yielded results in agreement with experiments, in
particular for small proteins (< 100 amino acids) [45, 46] reﬂecting the underlying simplicity in the folding of these
proteins. However, a G¯o model of longer proteins may lead to discrepancy in protein folding dynamics between
simulation and experiment because sequence-speciﬁc interactions may signiﬁcantly alter the protein folding dynamics.
Thus, we develop methodology to incorporate sequence speciﬁc information of the relative contribution of various
amino-acids into the G¯o model of SOD1.

II. RESULTS

We perform DMD simulations using the unscaled G¯o model, to determine the thermodynamic properties of a model
of SOD1 (as described in Methods). The temperature dependence of average potential energy is shown in Fig. 1a.
There is a sigmoidal increase in the potential energy with increasing temperature. At low temperatures, SOD1 is
present mostly in its native state, as evidenced by the small (≤ 2.83 ˚A) root-mean-square deviation, RM SD, from
the native state (Fig. 1b), and the small ﬂuctuations in the radius of gyration, Rg, around its native state value (14.2
˚A) (data not shown). At high temperatures, SOD1 is unfolded with the RM SD from the native state being greater
than 40 ˚A, demonstrating the loss of any structural similarity with the native state. Also, Rg is approximately three
times its value in the native state (data not shown), indicating that the average distance between any two amino acids
is approximately three times that in the native state.

In a typical trajectory (Fig. 2a) at the temperature corresponding to the mid-point of the abrupt change in potential
energy (Fig. 1a) dependence on temperature (deﬁned as the the folding transition temperature TF ), we observe three
distinct states: folded, unfolded and intermediate. A histogram of potential energies of protein conformations near TF
is, therefore, tri-modal (Fig. 2c), instead of the expected bi-modal for a two-state protein, indicating the presence of a
folding intermediate. The detection of the intermediate state is in contrast with the experimental observation of the
two-state folding dynamics of the SOD1 monomer [28]. Thus, the unscaled G¯o model for SOD1 does not accurately
reproduce the folding dynamics of SOD1. Next, we calculate the pairwise interaction energies in the native state of
SOD1 monomer and then employ the scaled G¯o model, to uncover SOD1 folding thermodynamics and kinetics.

A few contacts make a large thermodynamic contribution to SOD1 native state stability. We decompose
the stability of SOD1 into pairwise contributions (as described in Methods) that are plotted in the lower triangle in Fig.
3 (the energy map). In the energy map, some contacts, corresponding to both short-range and long-range interactions,
have signiﬁcantly stronger CHARMM interaction energies (from three to ﬁve times) than average. We ﬁnd that there
are 16 long-range interactions that have large (about ﬁve times larger than the average) interaction energies: Lys3-
Glu21, Lys3-Glu153, Lys30-Glu100, Ser34-Asp96, Lys36-Asp92, Glu40-Lys91, Glu49-Arg115, Arg69-Glu77, His71-
Asp83, Arg79-Asp83, Arg79-Asp101, His80-Asp83, Asp101-Val103, Glu121-Ser142, Asp125-Lys128, Glu133-Lys136.
The residues involved in the strong long-range contacts are highlighted in Fig. 4 and are involved in contacts between
oppositely charged amino acid pairs on the surface of the protein. Out of the 16 identiﬁed interactions, 6 have been
found to be directly disrupted in patients with FALS as a result of point mutations (listed in Table I) in the residues
making these contacts 1.
In most cases, the mutations correspond to the change of a charged amino acid for an
oppositely charged or a neutral one, suggesting an important role these key contacts play in SOD1 folding.

Scaling thermodynamically important contacts modulates folding kinetics in the G¯o model. We
test the importance of the identiﬁed amino acids in DMD simulations by scaling their contact strength in the G¯o
potential. We increase the depth of the interaction well of the identiﬁed key contacts to ﬁve times their original
value in the unscaled G¯o model (b = 5). Using this scaled G¯o model, we perform DMD simulations to calculate
the thermodynamic properties of the SOD1. We ﬁnd that the potential energy, RM SD and Rg (data not shown)
exhibit the same sigmoidal trend as for the unscaled G¯o model, but the folding transition temperature increases to
approximately 1.1 from its earlier value of 1.0. Remarkably, a typical trajectory near the folding transition temperature
(TF = 1.15) shows (Fig. 2b) that the intermediate state is no longer populated and the protein only exists in either
the folded or the unfolded state (Fig. 2b and d) near TF . Thus, by strengthening these key contacts we reproduce
the experimentally observed two state folding of SOD1 monomer [28, 29]. As control, we randomly select several

combinations of sixteen contacts and scale them by the same procedure.
observe such eﬀect on the folding kinetics (Fig. 2b), thus demonstrating that the eﬀect of strengthening the identiﬁed
contacts is speciﬁc. Importantly, this result uncovers a crucial connection between the folding thermodynamics and
kinetics of SOD1: in our model, the residues that contribute the most to the SOD1 thermodynamic stability of the
native state are also crucial for keeping the folding kinetics two-state.

Improper disulﬁde bonds cause kinetic trapping of SOD1. Human SOD1 is known to aggregate irreversibly
on heat denaturation [30] in vitro. One of the reasons for the irreversibility is improper disulﬁde bond formation
between free cysteines. There are four cysteine residues in the SOD1 monomer, at positions 6, 57, 111 and 146 of
which residues 57 and 146 form a disulﬁde linkage in the native state. We study the eﬀect of non-native disulﬁde bond
formation by starting from a fully unfolded conformation, generated at T=2.3 (≫ TF ), and cooling the system to low
temperature T=0.4 (≪ TF ) slowly, while allowing the possibility of interactions between any of the four cysteines to
form improper disulﬁde bond(s). We model disulﬁde bonds by an attractive potential (b = 2, γ = −1 in Eq. (2)). As
a control, we repeat the annealing procedure without these non-native disulﬁde bonds (b = 1, γ = 1 in Eq. (2)). We

observe that out of 20 trajectories with improper disulﬁde interactions, 4 result in SOD1 structures that are trapped
in non-native conformations while all of the 20 control trajectories fold to the correct native structure on the same
time scale, implying that occurrence of improper disulﬁde linkage increases the number of kinetic traps for the SOD1
chain en route to its native state. The above observation is statistically signiﬁcant (the probability of observing this
result by chance: p-value ≈0.01). The increased number of kinetic traps makes intermediate states more populated
and interaction of these intermediate states may make SOD1 prone to aggregation. We conclude that free cysteine
residues play an important part in the kinetics of folding, and possibly, aggregation.

III. DISCUSSION

D⇀↽2M →U

Experimental evidence suggests that the unfolding of dimeric superoxide dismutase occurs in a three state equilib-

rium [28, 29].

where D, M and U are SOD1 dimer, monomer and unfolded state respectively. In order to understand the eﬀect
of mutations on SOD1 folding, it is important to study the eﬀect of mutation on both processes in Eq. (1). Here,
we study the second process (M →U ) and report thermodynamically and kinetically important residues for SOD1
monomer folding.

Using our hybrid method, which incorporates molecular mechanics energetics into the G¯o model, we identify the
key residues involved in the folding of the protein. Surprisingly, the key residues are found on the surface of the
protein and not in its hydrophobic core (Fig. 4). By comparing the identiﬁed residues with a comprehensive list
of mutations associated with FALS 2, we ﬁnd that, 6 out of the 16 contacts identiﬁed in our simulations are found
to be implicated in the disease. In Table I, we list those FALS mutations, that disrupt contacts identiﬁed from our
simulations. We ﬁnd that these mutations replace a charged residue in the wild-type protein to a neutral or oppositely
charged residue in the mutant, thereby disrupting the electrostatic interaction. The presence of mutations disrupting
these contacts further underscores the importance of these key contacts and indicates that the disruption of even one
of these contacts may potentially result in protein misfolding.

There have been no experimental studies characterizing SOD1 monomer folding kinetics. However, other members of
the immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) superfold family [47], to which SOD1 belongs, are experimentally well-characterized.
Clarke and colleagues have established that the folding of pathways of Ig-like proteins share some common features
[48]. They observe that for ﬁve structurally similar Ig-like proteins, the folding rates are correlated with thermal
stabilities, suggesting a similar folding pathway for all members of the family. Thus, for Ig-like proteins, the kinetic
importance of residues in folding (φ-values [49]) is largely determined by the topology of the fold. We, therefore, expect
that the residues important for SOD1 folding are in structurally equivalent positions to other members of the Ig-like
super-fold family, whose folding kinetics is experimentally well-studied [48]. We choose Tnf3, the ﬁbronectin type
III domain of human tenascin, for which, based on φ-values, eight residues in the hydrophobic core were identiﬁed
as part of the folding nucleus [50]. We identify residues in SOD1 that are structurally equivalent to the nucleus
residues in Tnf3 by performing a structural alignment of the two proteins using DALI [51] and list these residues
in Table II. We discover that two of the residues corresponding to this putative nucleus correspond to the strongly
interacting key residues identiﬁed by our simulations, while three others are nearest neighbors of other residues we
identify. This is signiﬁcant because (i) mutations in the nucleus residues, being in proximity to the identiﬁed key
residues, may disrupt the network of interactions of key residues and aﬀect folding kinetics and (ii) in the G¯o model
entropic contributions are included as eﬀective energetic interactions. Therefore, the identiﬁed key residues may be
kinetically crucial because of the entropic contribution of the corresponding region of the structure (which is reﬂected
by high φ-values of the neighboring nucleus residues). Therefore, kinetic evidence further supports our hypothesis
that residues important for SOD1 native thermodynamics are important for folding kinetics.

Richardson and Richardson have pointed out [52] that the interactions between edges of β-strands are crucial to
regulate protein aggregation propensity. Naturally occurring β-sheet proteins prevent aggregation by protecting the
edges of β strands through a multitude of fold-speciﬁc mechanisms. In particular, for Ig-like β-sandwiches, strategically
placed side-chain charges at the edges and loop-crossing are dominant mechanisms which shield the edges of the sheets.
A recently solved crystal structure of mutant apo-SOD1 supramolecular assembly [53] identiﬁed three regions of the

SOD1 structure where non-native gain of interaction was observed leading to amyloid like arrangement of SOD1 in
crystals: the cleft between strands S5 and S6 (residues 83-100), the zinc loop (residues 65-78) and the electrostatic
loop (residues 125-142). It was noted that disorder in the zinc and electrostatic loops promoted non-native interactions
with the S5-S6 cleft, which is the interface between the two β-sheets of SOD1 and hence a likely site for edge-to-edge
aggregation [52]. We ﬁnd that most of the key contacts for proper folding are made by residues in the three regions
identiﬁed above. In particular, we see that contacts on both the edge-strands S5 and S6 play a crucial role in folding
kinetics. The contacts made by residues Asp92, Asp96 and Lys91 which form the turn in the S5-S6 hairpin are crucial
to seal the interface between the two β-sheets and likely prevent gain of non-native interactions, as shown in Fig. 5.
Thus, our simulations constitute another piece in the growing body of evidence which implicates edge protection
as the dominant mechanism by which natural proteins avoid aggregation. We postulate that the disruption of key
interactions is a plausible scenario for mutant mediated aggregation of SOD1. The re-organization of the S5-S6 edge
may be the dominant feature which distinguishes the aggregation-prone misfolded state of SOD1, from the native
state. The disruption of charge-charge interactions of the side-chains of the identiﬁed key residues, which stabilize the
β-barrel architecture of SOD1, might expose the edges of β-strand main-chain to interact with other structures, thus
leading to aggregation. Wang and Hecht [54] have shown that strategically designed mutations in β-strand overhangs
disfavor aggregation of normally aggregating proteins, further supporting our hypothesis.

We show that the presence of oxidisable cysteines enhances the kinetic trapping during folding. In the presence
of metals, cysteine oxidation is enhanced suggesting a plausible cause for the misfolding of SOD1. However, it has
recently been suggested [32] that misfolding of SOD1 likely takes place in the apo-enzyme state, when the metals have
not yet been delivered to SOD1. In the reducing environment of the cell, cysteine-mediated misfolding/aggregation
of the apoenzyme is, therefore, not a likely mechanism of SOD misfolding/aggregation. However, our observations
do suggest a generic mechanism for SOD1 misfolding especially for mutations that do not aﬀect the native state
conformational stability [30]. In the scenario similar to the one we have presented for free cysteines, other mutations
may aﬀect the folding kinetics of SOD1 by introducing non-native interactions along the folding pathway, leading to
kinetic trapping without substantially aﬀecting the native state stability.

IV. METHODS

The unscaled G¯o model. We use the Discrete Molecular Dynamics (DMD) algorithm [43, 55, 56] to study the
folding thermodynamics of SOD1. DMD has recently been used to study the folding kinetics [45, 46, 57, 58] and
aggregation of proteins [20, 59]. We model the SOD1 chain by the beads-on-a-string model developed by Ding et
al. [46] with beads corresponding to all Cα and Cβ atoms and constraints between neighboring beads to mimic real
protein ﬂexibility. We study the folding of one monomer derived from the crystal structure of SOD1 (Protein data
bank access code: 1SPD). We use the G¯o potential [38] to model the interaction energy, Vij , between Cβ atoms (Cα
for Gly) i and j of SOD1:

+∞,
γuij,
0,

|ri − rj | ≤ r0
r0 < |ri − rj| ≤ r1
|ri − rj | > r1

,

Vij = 




where |ri − rj| is the distance between atoms i and j. The parameters r0 and r1 are the hard-core diameter (set to
3.25 ˚A) and the cut-oﬀ distance (7.5 ˚A) between Cβ atoms (Cα for glycine) in the native state respectively. We assign
attractive interaction for native contacts (γ = −1), deﬁned to exist between pairs of residues whose Cβ atoms (Cα for
glycine) are closer than 7.5 ˚A in the native state, and repulsive interaction (γ = 1) for non-native contacts, deﬁned
to exist between Cβ atoms (Cα for glycine) which are farther than 7.5 ˚A in the native state.

The depth of the attractive square-well uij in Eq. (2) determines the strength of the attractive interaction between
two amino acids. First, we consider the case where all contacts are equally strong, i.e. the depth of each attractive
well is u. We call this case the unscaled G¯o model and use it to perform DMD simulations of SOD1. We ﬁnd that our
model undergoes a collapse transition to its native state through a meta-stable intermediate (see Results) in contrast
with the experimental observation of two-state folding dynamics of SOD1 monomer [28, 29]. A possible reason for
the existence of meta-stable intermediates is that in the unscaled G¯o model, all native contacts have equal strength.
While such an approximation holds for smaller proteins (such as Src SH3 [45]) with relatively low number of contacts
(∼ 162), SOD1 monomer has 495 native contacts and the assumption of equal contact strength overestimates the
population of intermediate species. Thus, in order to include sequence speciﬁcity of native interactions, we increase
the strength of few speciﬁc native contacts according to an all-atom model of SOD1 described below by making the
depth of the attractive well of some chosen native contacts buij, where b is the scale factor. We call this the scaled
G¯o model. By scaling G¯o potential according to an all atom model of the protein, we eﬀectively include the sequence
information.

The scaled G¯o model. To determine the relative strength of each individual native contact in SOD1, we use an

eﬀective energy function to decompose the total energy of the protein as a sum of pairwise terms [60]:

E =

Eij ,

X
i

X
j>i

where the summation is taken is over all pairs of residues of SOD1 and Eij is the energy of interaction between residues
i and j. To determine the terms Eij , we perform simulations with the molecular mechanics force ﬁeld CHARMM [61]
to construct an all atom model of the SOD1 monomer in the native state, starting from its crystal structure (PDB
accession code:1SPD). Recently, higher resolution crystal structures of apo-SOD1 have appeared in the literature [62],
but our results are not qualitatively aﬀected by starting with the higher resolution structure. We add hydrogen atoms
and remove any steric clashes occurring in the structure by energy minimization. The interactions which contribute the
most to the relative contact interaction strength are the non-bonded interactions and the solvent-induced interaction
screening [60]:

Eij = Enon−bonded
ij

+ Gij .

We compute Enon−bonded
energy, Gij, measures the screening of the pairwise interaction due to polarization of the solvent.

as the sum of the Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interaction energies. The solvation free

ij

We calculate Gij using an implicit description of the solvent [63]. We approximate the solvent as a continuous
dielectric medium with a dielectric constant (ǫ = 80) of water and the protein as a continuous medium with dielectric
constant (ǫ = 1) of vacuum. We compute the solvation energy by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the
ﬁnite diﬀerence method [64] available in CHARMM. Following Dominy et al. [65], in order to decompose the solvation
energy into pairwise contributions, we eliminate all charges in the protein except those corresponding to residue i and
calculate its “self” solvation energy Ui. Similarly, we compute Uj and Uij when charges corresponding to both i and
j are present. Then, the solvent mediated screening of the interaction is:

Gij = Uij − [Ui + Uj] .

So, we calculate the eﬀective pairwise energy contribution of a contact in the folded state.

The Eij values that we thus obtain correspond to the folded state of the protein. In order to calculate the pairwise
contribution of residues to the stability, we subtract the value of the contact energy in the unfolded state from
the Eij values obtained above. The unfolded state is an ensemble of conformations. It has been noted that there is
considerable native like structure in the unfolded state [66, 67, 68], meaning that the average environment of a contact
is likely the same as in the folded state, but this contact is formed less frequently. Therefore, we model the unfolded
state by simulating the unscaled G¯o model near TF and estimating the frequency of native contact formation. The
total contribution of a given contact to the stability can be written as:

where Eij is the contact energy in the folded state and pij is the probability of forming the contact in the unfolded
state. The energy and contact maps are plotted in Fig. 3.

∆Eij = Eij (1 − pij)

V. CONCLUSIONS

We present the folding thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of SOD1 using a hybrid molecular dynamics method.
We show that our simple model qualitatively reproduces the folding of SOD1 observed in experiments. We ﬁnd that
interactions at the edges of SOD1 β sheets and the zinc, electrostatic and cross-over loops are the key interactions that
modulate the folding of SOD1 suggesting that mutants destabilizing these interactions may make the enzyme more
prone to aggregation. In particular, we identify the S5-S6 cleft (residues 83-100) as a likely site for reorganization to
yield an aggregation prone misfolded state, an observation consistent with recent experimental evidence [53] and the
negative design paradigm [52]. We also provide a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of increased reversibility
of folding upon mutation of free cysteine residues. We ﬁnd good agreement between the positions identiﬁed by us
to be crucial for folding kinetics and those identiﬁed by experiments [50] on other members of the super-fold family
(Ig-like proteins) to which SOD1 belongs. Further, we ﬁnd that mutations at six of the residue contacts we identify
are implicated in FALS.

FIG. 1: SOD1 thermodynamic properties. Dependence on temperature of (a) average energy (b) RM SD in DMD simulations
with unscaled G¯o potential. The sigmoidal curves in both (a) and (b) show that SOD1 undergoes a collapse transition. Similar
curves are obtained for DMD simulations with the scaled G¯o potential.

13

FIG. 2: Typical DMD trajectories near TF for (a) unscaled and (b) scaled G¯o models. One trajectory is shown out of 4 for
the unscaled G¯o model and 5 for the scaled G¯o model. In (b), a control trajectory with randomly chosen contacts (see text)
strengthened is shown in grey. Histograms of energy values near TF , for (c) unscaled and (d) scaled G¯o models, averaged over
4 and 5 trajectories respectively, are also shown. From (b) and (d) we observe that the intermediate state is not populated in
the scaled G¯o model but is present in the unscaled G¯o model, indicating that the kinetics of the scaled G¯o model is indeed
two-state as observed in experiments [28, 29].

FIG. 5: S5-S6 cleft. The residues in the cleft which are identiﬁed as crucial for making the folding kinetics two-state in our
model, are highlighted. This cleft represents one of the edges of the β-barrel and is a possible site for initiation of non-native
contact formation as also found in Ref. [53], leading to aggregation.

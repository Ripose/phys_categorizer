Abstract

The writhe of a space curve fragment is considered for various
boundary conditions. An expression for the writhe as a function of
arclength for an arbitrary space curve is obtained. The formula is built
on the base of closing the tangent indicatrix with a geodesic. The cor-
responding closure of a curve in 3-space is explicitly constructed. The
addition rule for writhe is formulated. A relationship connecting the
writhe with the Gauß integral over the open curve is presented. The
single and double regular helical shapes are examined as examples.

Key words: the writhe, the twist, the linking number.

Introduction

The term “writhe” (or “writhing number”) was ﬁrst proposed by Fuller
r that arises as a diﬀerence between the linking num-
[1] for a quantity

k and the twist (or “twisting number”)

The sense of this very simple-looking and very famous (isn’t the second a
consequence of the ﬁrst?) relationship is that the right-hand side, though
deﬁned for a ribbon, depends only on its central curve.

Since

r is a characteristic of spatial complexity of a curve, it makes
this quantity worth to consider while examining lengthy physical objects.
r have been computed in a number of works
In particular, the values of
for various models of large-scale structure of DNAs (e.g., [4, 5, 6]) as well
as for experimental data on these molecules [7]. RNA tertiary structures
and the protein folding are other neighbour areas for an application of the
geometrical and topological tools developed in the DNA studies [8]. How-
ever, the application of the writhe is conﬁned formally by smoothly closed
shapes though quite a lot of interesting objects have their ends not joined
(or joined non-smoothly). One should mention here the studies based on
the recently developed experimental techniques of manipulation with single
DNA molecules [9]. The modelling curves require an appropriately deﬁned
measure to characterize their arrangement in space. Therefore, it seems to
be helpful to generalize the notion of the writhe onto non-closed curves and
their fragments. Indeed, such trials (explicit and implicit) have been made
[10, 11, 12, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In some cases the deﬁnitions of the writhe
suggested in diﬀerent works are not consistent to each other.

The aim of this paper is to give a consistent and natural generalization
of the notion of writhe to an arbitrary fragment of a curve and to derive
explicit formulas for its computation as a function of the arclength. The
basic idea consists in a construction of the closure of the fragment under
consideration in such a way that it would correspond to the closure of the
tangent indicatrix by an arc of a great circle, as it has been proposed by
Maggs [15, 16]. In some sense, we can think then about the writhe as being
locally deﬁned (cf. [18]).

If r
= 0, then the twist of a ribbon may be decomposed into
the twist of the Frenet frame plus the twist of the ribbon relative to the
Frenet frame [19]:

The angle φ = φ(s) is an angle between u and the principal normal. By the
Frenet ribbon is meant a special one deﬁned by the principal normal vector
to the curve. The Frenet ribbon is deﬁned uniquely by the space curve r(s),
if r′′ 6

= 0. The twist of the Frenet ribbon is

2.2 The basic relations

W

Two theorems by Fuller [20, 21] are valid. They provide the means to
compute

r eﬃciently.

∈

1. Let B = r(s)

C 3 be a closed oriented space curve with its tangent
r′B(s), s the arclength. The tangent traces out a closed curve ˜B(s) on the
unit sphere which is piecewise of class C 2. The curve ˜B(s) is divided into a
ﬁnite family of non-self-intersecting closed piecewise C 2 space curves. Each
curve of this family then encloses a domain Ωi deﬁned so that the geodesic
normal points into its interior. Let SB be the sum of the areas of these
domains (the components are counted with multiplicity determined by how
many times the corresponding domains are encircled by the curve). Then

r (r) =

SB

2. Let r0(θ) and r1(θ) be two closed non-self-intersecting curves in R3
[0, Θ] being the common regular parameter. Let there exist
rλ(θ), λ

of class C 2, θ
a continuous deformation F(λ) : (θ, λ)

We should stress that both theorems are applicable to closed curves.
Nevertheless, the works occur (e.g., [22]) in which the writhe of a linear
(non-closed) curve is computed by means of Eq. (7) that leads generally to
improper results.

Let the ribbon (r, u) be also closed: u(0) = u(L). Denote by

2.3 The Gauß integral over self-intersecting and non-smooth

curves

We are going to show that the integral in Eq. (4 ) is well-deﬁned also for
curves that are smooth only piecewise. To demonstrate this, it is suﬃcient to
consider a fragment of a curve in the vicinity of the point where the tangent
vector is not continuous. If the double integral does not diverge in this point
then, as a consequence, it also exists for curves crossing themselves in a ﬁnite
number of points.

As a general case, we take the model of two curves (which may be thought
of as two smooth fragments of the same curve) r1(s1) and r2(s2) that have
one common point O : r1(0) = r2(0); s1 and s2 are the arclengths, si ∈
[0, li], i = 1, 2. Generally, t1(0)
= t2(0). Each of the two curves is of
class C 3 and, near O, it may be locally described in its own Frenet frame

It vanishes only if a31κ1 = 0 and a13κ2 = 0. This happens when either 1) the

point and its tangent lies in the tangent plane of the other one or 3) the
tangent planes of both curves coincide.

Now let a11 =

1. The meaning of this is that the curves r1 and r2
form a curve having a continuous tangent. We introduce the angle χ which
parametrizes the relative orientation of the Frenet frames at O (or one can
interpret χ as a discontinuity angle between principal normals). Then we
have for the entries of the orientation matrix: a12 = a21 = a13 = a31 = 0,

The case a11 = 1 corresponds to the cusp points and requires a special
consideration which is beyond the scope of the present paper. Therefore we
exclude cusps from the following analysis.

3 A periodic curve

On the one hand, the treatment of the periodic curve case is the most resem-
bling to that of the closed conﬁguration. On the other hand, the periodic
curves are often met in various physical and, in particular, biomechanical
models. For example, the linear helices and interwound structures are com-
mon in the DNA modelling (e.g., see [23]).

3.1 A formula for the writhe

s

≤

≤

Let rA(s) be periodic in space: rA(s + LA) = rAL + rA(s), LA the period,
rAL = const. For the tangent tA(s) = r′A(s), it implies tA(s + LA) =
tA(s). Denote tA0 = tA(0) and tA1 = tA(LA). Consider the segment
LA. The tangent indicatrix is a closed curve which sweeps
A : 0
out an area SA on the unit sphere S2 (in the same sense as in the Fuller
ﬁrst theorem). Now construct a ribbon RA for the segment A in the same
manner as it is done in the proof of the Fuller ﬁrst theorem [21]. Generally,
the ribbon RA is determined by the unit principal normal vector nA(s).
However, we should account for the possible inﬂection points of A with the
discontinuous normals. Because of this, in the vicinities of the inﬂection
points the ribbon RA is to be arbitrary modiﬁed to make it continuous
with a new modiﬁed generating vector uA. Due to the periodicity property,
uA1. For the sake of simplicity, we shall be also
uA0 ≡
assuming, here and further, that uA0 = nA(0) and uA1 = nA(LA).

uA(0) = uA(LA)

≡

The twist of RA, which is well deﬁned for non-closed ribbons as well,

satisﬁes the equation

w (rA, uA) +
T

SA
2π

= 0

mod 1

(11)

(the above follows from the proof of the Fuller ﬁrst theorem which, in turn,
is a consequence of the Gauß-Bonnet theorem).

At each point of the ribbon A we can deﬁne an orthonormal frame
uA(s)
tA(s), uA(s), tA(s)
, which is an element of SO(3). Thus, the
{
}
ribbon A corresponds to a closed loop ˆA in the space of orientations SO(3)
Z2 which is
[24]. Following Hannay [25], we deﬁne an integer number N

and N = 1 otherwise. Then Eq. (11 ) is a consequence of the Hannay
formula

Now build a planar non-self-intersecting segment C : rC(s)

LC, that closes the segment A. That means that rC(0) = rA(LA),

r′C (s)) and C lies in the
rC (LC) = rA(0), tC(0) = tA1, tC(LC) = tA0 (tC ≡
plane determined by tA0 and rAL (if tA0 k
rAL, then we choose the plane
spanned by tA0 and t′A0). The closing segment C may be chosen such that
its ǫ-vicinity does not cross the ribbon RA. In addition, we require that the
principal normal at the beginning and at the end points be well deﬁned and
have the same direction: nC(0) = nC (LC). Then the number of inﬂection
points of C is even.

∈

There exists a ribbon (rC (s), vC (s)) lying entirely in the plane of C
with its ends deﬁned by the normal vectors vC (0) = nC(0) and vC(LC) =
nC (LC). Clearly, its twist is zero. (In the case of no inﬂection points, this
ribbon coincides with the Frenet ribbon.) Construct another ribbon on the
tC(s)
curve C with a vector uC (s), uC(s), uC(s)
0, which diﬀers from
·
the vector vC (s) by a constant angle: uC (s)
vC (s) = cos φ0 = const, and
·
uC (0) = uA1.
It is evident that uC(LC ) = uC(0), uC(LC) = uA0 and
w (rC , uC ) = 0.
T

Thus, joining the (oriented) ribbons A : (rA, uA) and C : (rC , uC) gives
a continuous closed ribbon which we shall denote by A + C. The linking
number of a closed ribbon is an integer and, by applying the C˘alug˘areanu-
White-Fuller relation to A + C, we have

We see that in the case of a periodic curve the same formula is valid for

the writhe of a period as in the case of a smoothly closed loop.

Note that the tangent indicatrix of the joined ribbon diﬀers from that of
A by an appendage corresponding to the planar segment C. This appendage

If the writhe of a period is to be calculated by using the double integral
formula of Eq. (4), then at ﬁrst the segment of the period should be closed by
an additional planar segment as described above and after that the formula

(4) should be applied to the entire closed loop, though the double
integral in Eq. (4) is also well deﬁned for open segments.
Another way to compute the value of the writhe

rA is the application

and the tangent indicatrix is a 8-shaped self-intersecting curve consisting of
the two identical loops (Fig. 2). Let S1 be the spherical area inside one loop,
then the complementary area of the other loop equals 4π
S1. Thus, the
sum of the areas of the two domains deﬁned as in the Fuller ﬁrst theorem,
amounts to 4π, and, according to Eq. (14),

The last conclusion is evidently true for every periodic curve, the tangent

This result may be easily veriﬁed (and reﬁned) by applying Eq. (15). To

We again deal with the segment A of a spatial curve rA(s), 0

We now make no assumptions on the behaviour of this curve outside the
segment A. Only one additional condition is to be satisﬁed: the tangent
vector at the beginning is the same as one at the ending point: tA0 ≡
tA1. Then the tangent indicatrix is again a closed curve

C have an even number of inﬂection points, all of them being interior. In
addition, C is such that it is separated from the ribbon RA by the distance
more than ǫ.

A ribbon on C exists that lies in the same plane as C and with its
end vectors coinciding with nC(0) = nC(LC ). Denote its generating vector

by vC (s). We build a ribbon on the curve C by using a vector uC (s),
tC (s) = 0, which is the vector vC (s) turned through a constant angle
uC (s)
φ0: uC(s)
vC(s) = cos φ0 = const. Choose φ0 such that uC (0) = uA1. By
the construction of C, uC(LC) = uC(0) and the ribbon C has zero twist:
w (rC , uC ) = 0.
T

We see that the joined ribbon A + C may have only one point of discon-
tinuity, namely, the starting point of A (corresponding to the terminal point
of C). At this point the twist angle between uC(LC) and uA0 is exactly γ.
The following relation is valid, according to [28], for the discontinuous

curve constructed under the above conditions:

between the normals nA0 and nA1. An analogue to Eq. (24) was used in
the analysis of the elongation of a supercoiled DNA molecule carried out
by Bouchiat and M´ezard [13, 14] (though their angle χ is measured in the
opposite direction to γ).

5 An arbitrary open segment

5.1 The general case

The most general case takes place if we dismiss the equality condition of the
tangent vectors at both ends of the spatial curve segment A : rA(s), 0
≤
LA. In other words, the tangent indicatrix has not to be closed any more.
Nevertheless, we can construct the ribbon RA : (rA, uA) in exactly the same
manner as we did it previously. The orientations of the generating vector
uA at the ends may be diﬀerent.

≤

s

In order to get a measure for the writhe of A consistent with the above
considered cases we choose to close the tangent indicatrix with a geodesic
[15, 16]. This choice is natural and it is supported by treatment of analogous
problems in optics and quantum mechanics [29]. (In the generic case tA0 6
=
tA1, there are two possible geodesics, we take one of them; the case tA0 =
±
tA1 will be discussed later.)

Let G be a planar segment rG(s), 0

LG, in the plane determined
by tA0, tA1 such that rG(0) = rA(LA) and r′G(0) = tA1, r′G(LG) = tA0. We

γ1 such that uG0 ≡

the two ribbons RA and RG are continuously glued to produce the joined
ribbon RA+G.

−

We now can see that the assumption of the previous case is satisﬁed for
the joined curve A + G: it has the same tangents at the ends. By applying
Eq. (22) to A + G, we obtain

It should be noted that although Eq. (25) is valid mod 2, actually
we may deﬁne and compute only fractional part of the writhe because of an
arbitrariness of one of two closing geodesics chosen. To put this another way,
we are able to determine the area only mod 2π. Therefore, the writhe of

Remark 1. It follows from the above that the writhe of a curve segment
(closed or open) whose tangent indicatrix is geodesic and such that tA0 +
tA1 6
= 0, is an integer. In other words, the writhe of any planar curve is
always integer.

−

Consider now the case tA0 =

tA1. The closing geodesic G is not deter-
mined uniquely then. If we examine the behaviour of the tangent indicatrix
in the vicinities s = 0 and s = LA (also paying attention to the neighbour
curves on S2 close to the critical one), then we see that the plane of the clos-
ing geodesics may rotate through
π as the length of the segment changes
∼
so that the critical point tA0 =
tA1 is passed. In mechanics terms, this
−
phenomenon may be called ﬂipping of the closing segment. It is the critical
point where the choice of one geodesics based on the continuity argument is
no more valid.

E.L.Starostin. On the writhe of non-closed curves

19

Speaking more strictly, the value of the writhe for a segment with the
oppositely directed ends is not determined. It may be ascribed a value which
is average of the two limits taken as the length of the segment is pre-critical
and post-critical. That means that the great circle plane for the closing
geodesics in the critical point has to be taken orthogonal to the limiting
positions both of the great circle planes chosen for the growing segment
0. (We assume that
[ǫ, LA −
the deﬁnition segment for the curve A may be inﬁnitesimally extended in
both directions.) Formally, this choice is a plane spanned by tA0, nA0 + nA1.
For such a closure, γ1 + γ0 = π and Eq. (28) becomes

while Eq. (26) does not change (as usual, by SA+G is meant the area swept
out by the closed curve A+G deﬁned as above). If, in addition, nA0 +nA1 =
0, then a plane spanned by tA0 and bA0 has to be chosen.

mod 1,

−T

Remark 2. In the above consideration we have used the ribbon gener-
ally based on the principal normal (cf.
[21]), though any other continuous
ribbon may be taken to obtain essentially the same formula for writhe (of
course, the speciﬁc expressions for the angles γ1 and γ0 should be appropri-
ately modiﬁed).

In particular, the fractional part of writhe equals the twist of a special
ribbon such that its generating normal vectors at the ends have they prop-
erty that they could be transformed to each other by a parallel transport
along the closing geodesics (i.e. γ1 + γ0 = 0 mod 2π).

5.2 A broken curve

The above approach may be naturally extended to a sequence of disjoint
A(i) be a set of n continuous fragments. Each A(i) is

segments. Let A =

n

i=1
0 and A(i)
oriented so that A(i)
P
1 be its initial and terminal points, respectively.
Based on A(i), a ribbon R(i)
A may be built as it was done for a single piece of
curve. We also construct n additional pieces that tie the ending point of the
i-th fragment to the initial point of the consequent one. We identify formally
the point A(n+1)
to make the entire curve closed. The connecting
parts are built in exactly the same way as the closure of a single segment
was made in the previous subsection. Thus, we can repeat our arguments

Note that the value of writhe generally depends on both the order of

fragments and the orientations along them.

5.3 A non-smoothly closed loop

A particular case takes place when the segment A forms a non-smoothly
closed shape. This means discontinuity of the tangent vector at the initial
point and the tangent indicatrix is not closed. The whole procedure de-
scribed above may be well applied to such a loop though one complication
appears: the resulting closed curve to which the basic C˘alug˘areanu-White-
Fuller formula is to be applied has a self-intersection point at the beginning
of the loop considered. Generally, the writhe is not deﬁned for such shapes.
However, on the one hand, it was shown in Section 2.3 that the Gauß in-
tegral exists unless the tangent at the loop starting point directs exactly
opposite to the end tangent. On the other hand, under the same limitation,
we can restrict ourselves to consideration of two limiting curves approaching
the self-intersection shape from two diﬀerent sides. As it is well known, the
writhe jumps by 2 as a curve crosses itself [20]. Thus, the fractional part
of the writhe is not aﬀected by self-intersection and may be computed by
Eq. (26) or Eq. (28) in the same way as for the open segment.

6 Adding the writhe

The aim of this section is to obtain an equation that expresses the writhe of
a segment concatenated from two or more shorter segments as a function of
the writhes of those smaller elements.

We start with a consideration of an open or closed segment A = rA(s) :
R3 that has a (smoothly) closed tangent indicatrix ˜A on S2. Let

˜A be the point corresponding to the starting tangent tA(0) and a point
D
˜A represents some other value of s = s1 : 0 < s1 < LA. We draw a
E
geodesic ˜G to tie the points E and D (oriented from E to D). Denote the
R3.
two subsegments A1 = rA(s) : [0, s1]
→
Thus, A1 + A2 = A. The writhe of the initial segment A is, according to
Eq. (22),

R3 and A2 = rA(s) : [s1, LA]

6.3 The writhe of a growing curve

Though Eq. (39) is valid modulo 1, it can be used for computation of the
exact value of the writhe of a curve which can be considered as being incre-
mentally elongated. Suppose we add to the curve A1 a fragment A2 which

is short enough such that
| ≪
rA1 is known. In the absence of self-intersections, the writhe is
value of
a continuous function of the arclength and we can apply Eq. (39) omitting
mod 1 to get the exact value of the writhe of the extended curve. Starting
with a short fragment and reiterating the above procedure, it is possible to
compute the writhe of an arbitrarily long curve in n steps where n is the
number of increments.

7 The writhe of a polygonal line

In this section we consider a curve consisting of a number of straight line
segments. Such a curve can serve as a model of a self-avoiding walk [10] or
as a skeleton description of a linear polymer [8].

Though the polygonal line has a discontinuous tangent, it may be con-
sidered as a limit of a smooth curve which diﬀers from the polygonal line by
arbitrarily small planar arcs in the vicinities of every point of discontinuity.
The consequitive tangent directions are then connected by geodesics on S2
[16]. It can also describe the path of a scattered light beam [30].

Conversely, an arbitrary smooth curve may be approximated by a polyg-
In [31] one can ﬁnd an estimate of the diﬀerence between the

writhing numbers of a closed smooth curve and a polygonal curve inscribed
within.

Let A =

Several methods have been proposed for computation of the writhe of
closed polygons [32, 33]. Here we give an exact expression for the fractional
part of the writhe for an arbitrary polygonal line. The formula does not

This expression is valid for any curve in R3 that generates a tangent
indicatrix containing only geodesic fragments. Also, it seems to be useful
as an approximation while calculating the writhe of a smooth curve which
can be properly discretized. The last means that the discretization should
be better performed on its tangent indicatrix rather than on the curve in
R3 itself. Conventional methods of integration may be applied to compute
an approximate value of the area swept out on S2.

8 The writhe and the Gauß integral

The writhe of the smooth closed curve may be expressed as the double
integral (Eq. (4)). It is evident that the writhe for an open segment of the
length L as deﬁned above can no more be computed as the Gauß integral
over this segment though, in most cases, the double integral itself is also
well deﬁned for smooth non-closed curves.

Our aim here is to obtain a formula connecting the both values: on
the one hand, the writhe that relates to the diﬀerence between the linking
number and the twisting for the ribbon built with the geodesic closure and,
on the other hand, simply the double integral taken over the open segment.

8.1 An open curve and its closure

R3.
Consider an open smooth non-self-intersecting curve A = r(s) : [0, L]

We extend the curve A with two straight line segments: B : rB(s1) = r(L)+
[0, l] and C : rC(s2) = r(0) + s2t(0), s2 ∈
s1t(L), s1 ∈
l, 0]. Note that the
both segments have the same length l. Now connect the end points of B
and C with the straight line segment Dl : rD(ξ) = (1

What we have now is a closed circuit A+B +Dl +C. It is smooth except
for two points at the beginning and at the end of Dl. We modify B and Dl
in the small vicinity of where they join themselves together by introducing
a planar curvilinear segment E with the tangent varying from t(L) to tD.
All three segments involved belong to the same plane spanned by t(L) and
tD. We can assume that the length of E does not depend on l. The length
of the shortened segment B

is decreased to be l
∗
The similar procedure may be carried out to smoothen the join of the
segments Dl and C. The new planar curvilinear segment F belongs to
the plane spanned by t(0) and tD. The length of F is the same for every
l; without loss of generality, we assume that the length of the shortened

Let us now examine the case of parallel tangents t(0) = t(L). The two
attached segments B and C have opposite directions then and, instead of
the straight line D, we connect them by a circular arc ˘D joining B and C at
the same distance l from the ends of A. The arc ˘D lies in the plane spanned
r(0) and t(0) and its length is of order l for large l.

Again, the smoothening curves E and F can be constructed in the similar
way as it is done in the regular case. Thus, we obtain the smooth planar
closure of the curve A.

After letting the lengths of B

go to inﬁnity and analysing the

∗
double integral components in the expression for the writhe we come to the
same Eq. (44) with the right-hand terms deﬁned as above.

∗

It may occur that the ray B or C intersects the curve A. Then, generally,
the writhe of the whole closed curve A+B +E +D+F +C is not determined.
The situation is the same as for a non-smoothly closed loop (Section 5.3).
In the generic case, when the tangents in the point of the intersection are
neither coincident nor of opposite direction, the fractional part of the writhe
still can be found by the examination of the two limiting positions of the
curves in the vicinity of the intersection point. Since the writhe jumps by 2
as the curve goes through itself, the half-sum of the writhes for those curves
may be taken as the value of the writhe. The same approach may be applied
to another singular case when the rays B and C cross each other. Moreover,
the constraint of non-self-intersection of the initial open fragment A my also
be weakened in the similar fashion.

Next we are going to clarify the structure of the integrals

proportional to the signed area of the spherical triangle constituted by the

In this section we shall be dealing with a regular circular helix: r(s) =
(cos as, sin as, √1
L, s is the arc coordinate
1, 0
and L the length of the segment. The limiting values of the parameter a
correspond to a straight line (a = 0) and a circle of the unit radius (a = 1).

9.1 The writhe of an arbitrary segment of the helix

We now illustrate the above developed approach by applying Eq. (28) to the
helix. We need to calculate the twist ﬁrst. The normal n(s) is a well-deﬁned
continuous vector function and

The second step is to calculate the angles γ1 and γ0. To this purpose,
we ﬁnd the tangent, normal and binormal vectors at the beginning (s = 0)
and at the end (s = L) points of the segment:

t0 = (0, a,

9.2 The writhe by the double integral

We wish to make use of the double integral formula (see Eq. (4)) in order to
compute the writhe of the inﬁnite helix by an alternative means. We take a
1 being integer, and close it as described above
helix A with 2M turns, M
with the planar curve C. (We could equally take an odd number of turns, but
the even number facilitates the algebraic manipulations.) We can build C as
a union of three fragments: C = C1 + C2 + C3. All the fragments lie in the

In Eq. (54), we imply that the curves C1 and C3 remain unchanged
as M varies and only the length of the straight line fragment C2 increases
appropriately with M growing. Then it may be shown that the right-hand
side of Eq. (54) depends on the shape of neither C1 nor C3.

The last expression agrees with the value of the writhe for m = 2 (Eq. (53)).
We remark that the computation of the writhe (and twist) of the helix
is a favourite example of an application of the ﬁrst Fuller theorem (e.g., see
[20, 19, 34]) though the author has not come across the direct usage of the
double integral formula in the literature. It is evident, that the last approach
is much more tedious, but it seems to be instructive to see it at work. To
complete the picture, we show in the next section how to calculate the same
quantity by means of the Fuller second theorem.

9.3 The writhe by the Fuller second theorem

We consider two curves. The ﬁrst one is a segment of a straight line
A0 : r0 = (1, 0, √1
a2s) and the second is one period of the helix A1 :
−
r1 = (cos as, sin as, √1
a2s), the same as above. The common parameter
−
s varies from 0 to T = 2π
a (note that it is not the arclength coordinate for
A0).

The Fuller second theorem is only applicable to closed curves, so we have
to close both our segments. We shall do it in accordance with the procedure
described above for periodic curves. Namely, we close A0 and A1 each with
a curve lying in the plane x = 1 and consisting of three fragments. The
closure of A0 contains the parts:
1) C01, a semicircle of radius R0 > 0 with the tangent t01 = (0,

The integrand in Eq. (7) vanishes on the straight line segments of the

9.4 A double helix

The procedure of the calculation of the writhe of a helix is very similar to
that for a double helical shape. The helix is assumed to be regular, circular
and closed at both ends in the same manner as it is described above for
open curves. The diﬀerence is that each of the two closing curves joins two
diﬀerent helices.

In this section we show how to obtain the limiting value of the writhe per
turn when the integer number of turns tends to inﬁnity. We include into our
consideration the case when the double helix is not symmetric with respect
to the central axis (as it takes place in the B-form of DNA, for example).
Each of the two helical curves will be called a strand.

The ﬁrst strand is described as the helix D0 : r1(s1) = (cos as1, sin as1,

We can conclude that the mixed integral over D0 and D1 is bounded
uniformly with respect to M . The same is true for the pairs (D3, D0),
(D1, D2), (D2, D3) and, of course, for (D1, D3). Now we see that the only
pairs that count in Eq. (61) are those involving both strands. Note that the

9.5 The writhe of the double helix of arbitrary length

Here we continue dealing with the non-symmetric double helix, but now we
consider the general case when the helix does not need to have an integer
number of turns. The length of each strand is the same and denoted by L.
We apply the equation for writhe that was found earlier for the sequence
of disjoint fragments (Section 5.2). In the double helix case, we have only

This expression is in compliance with the writhe per length for an integer
number of turns (Eq. (63)). If we think about the double helix as a contin-
uously growing structure, then it is evident that the last equation gives not
r , but its exact value as function of one strand
only the fractional part of
length.

We see that the growing double helix delivers an example of a family of
curves A(h), parametrized with the continuous parameter h, such that the
writhe is a linear function of the length. Clearly, the writhe per (double
helix) length is constant. Also, note that the writhe does not depend on the
oﬀset angle ϕ which controls the mutual location of the strands (in terms of
DNA we may reformulate the last observation as an invariance property of
writhe with respect to the widths of the minor or major grooves).

10 Conclusion

We have been concerned with the generalization of the notion of the writhe
for an arbitrary space curve and with obtaining eﬀective formulas for its
computation. We have analyzed various conditions on the position and
orientation of the ends of the fragment in space starting with a periodic
curve and ﬁnishing at the most common case.

In all cases, an explicit construction of a closed ribbon was carried out.
This makes it possible an application of the C˘alug˘areanu-White-Fuller equa-
tion to the determination of the writhe. A rule for the calculation of the
writhe for a segment which is a union of smaller parts, is obtained. We
examined a polygonal line as a special case.

A relation was established between the writhe and the Gauß integral
taken over the open fragment. The diﬀerence between these two quantities
may be represented as three single integrals.

The application of the formulas presented was demonstrated on the ex-
amplar curves, including regular single and double helices. In particular, the
writhe as a continuous function of arclength is deﬁned for a regular helix.
It was shown that a double helix of ﬁnite length, with “geodesic” closures
at the ends, provides an example of a one-parameter family of curves that
realizes the linear dependence of the writhe on the length and the writhe is
invariant with respect to the value of the oﬀset between the strands.

E.L.Starostin. On the writhe of non-closed curves

48

In Appendix A, a new derivation of the formula connecting the writhe

and the twist for a non-closed ribbon with one continuous edge is given.

11 Appendix A: A formula for a non-closed ribbon

The formula, we are about to deduce, relates to a ribbon based on a smooth
closed curve but generated by a vector function which has a discontinuity.
Such a ribbon may serve as a model to a nicked circular DNA, one strand
of which is cleaved.

→

We will consider a closed smooth non-self-intersecting space curve A =
R3 of class C 2. We assume for the sake of simplicity that
r(s) : [0, L]
the parameter s is the arclength. The smooth closure implies r(0) = r(L),
t1, r′′(0) = r′′(L). Let the curve A be equipped with
t0 ≡
the continuous vector function u(s) : [0, L]

these two vectors, measured up to modulo 2π. This angle is a characteristic
of discontinuity by which the ribbon (r, u) fails to close (Fig. 9).

E.L.Starostin. On the writhe of non-closed curves

49

Our aim here is to obtain an equation connecting the writhe of the curve

A, its twist and the angle α.

Consider the tangent indicatrix ˜A of the curve A on S2. It is a closed
curve. Choose a great circle plane containing t0 = t1. It has at least one
common point with the tangent indicatrix. We look for a plane having at
least two more intersections with ˜A. Such a plane almost always exists.
Indeed, take a great circle which is tangent to ˜A at the initial point with
the tangent t0. Generically, there is an alternative: either the great circle
intersects ˜A (the ﬁrst case) or not (the second one). In the ﬁrst case, it is
enough to rotate the great circle plane about t0 through a small angle to
provide two additional points of intersections that bifurcate from the initial
one. Consider the second case. The whole tangent indicatrix of a closed
curve may not lie in only one of the two semispheres (see Theorem 1 in
[35]). Then the closedness of ˜A implies at least two crossings in addition to
the common initial point.

We should distinguish the singular case when the tangent indicatrix is

return to this case later.

For a regular conﬁguration, we can choose two additional points P2 :
r′(s2),
r′(s3) (it is easy to show that the points may be always taken such

The starting point and P2 and P3 divide the curve A into 3 parts, namely,

[ǫ1 +ǫ2 +ǫ3+s3, ǫ1 +ǫ2+ǫ3 +L].

The compound curve B(ǫ1, ǫ2, ǫ3) = D1 + B1 + D2 + B2 + D3 + B3 is closed
if ǫ1t0 + ǫ2t2 + ǫ3t3 = 0. We put ǫ2 = pǫ1 and ǫ3 = qǫ1 and choose ǫ > 0
[0, ǫ]. Thus, we

The next step is to deﬁne ribbons (B(ǫ1), U),

have constructed an one-parameter family of closed pulled-out curves B(ǫ1),
ǫ1 ∈
(0, ǫ]. For the frag-
ments Bi, i = 1, 2, 3, we keep the same vectors U = u as for the respective
parts Ai, i = 1, 2, 3. For the fragments D2 and D3, U = u(s2) = const and
U = u(s3) = const, respectively. For the remained fragment D1, we deﬁne
U(σ), σ

[0, ǫ1] such that U(0) = u(L) and U(ǫ1) = u(0):

Since we have chosen ǫ small enough to exclude self-intersections of the
curve (more accurately, we have to require an absence of self-crossings for
the whole ribbon), the right-hand side of Eq. (64) does not depend on ǫ1.

By the construction, the tangent indicatrix of B(ǫ1) is the same for
any ǫ1 (namely, it is ˜A because B(0) = A). Therefore, due to the Fuller
ﬁrst theorem (and taking into account the absence of self-intersections),

In conclusion, we explain how one has to treat the degenerated case of a

choose the second point on ˜A as diametrically opposed to the starting one,
i.e., t0 + t2 = 0. In other words, we can proceed the same way as in the
regular case after putting p = 1 and q = 0. It is evident, that the result will
not change.

Abstract

The property of an amino acid is diﬀerent according to the variation of protein secondary structure.

Each central amino acid corresponds to a position speciﬁc amino acid distribution around it. Based on the

probability distribution for the central amino acid, we get amino acid distance matrices and classiﬁcations

for helix, sheet, coil and turn. It is observed that evident discrepancy exists in amino acid distance for

diﬀerent protein secondary structure. Some obvious diﬀerence between the distance matrices and blocks

substitution matrix(BLOSUM) is found which can tell the diﬀerence of amino acid property between

in certain protein secondary structure and the whole protein database. The classiﬁcation of amino acid

alphabets for speciﬁc protein secondary structure provide a clue for observing these diﬀerence.

1 Introduction

The similarity of amino acid(aa) property is the basis of sequence alignment, protein design and protein

structure prediction, etc. Several scoring schemes have been provided for estimating amino acid similarity.

The mutation data matrices of Dayhoﬀ [5] and the substitution matrices of Henikoﬀ [1] are generally con-

sidered the standard choices for sequence alignment and amino acid similarity evaluating. However, these

matrices focus on characters based on whole protein database but not for the separated protein secondary

1

structure(ss). Whether the amino acid property is same or not in diﬀerent protein secondary structure is an

interesting question. And more, understanding these diﬀerence can help us work better.

A central task of protein sequence analysis is to uncover the exact nature of the information encoded in

the primary structure. We still cannot read the language describing the ﬁnal 3D fold of an active biological

macromolecule. Compared with the DNA sequence, a protein sequence is generally much shorter, but the

size of the alphabet is ﬁve times larger. Further more, amino acid have diﬀerent property according to its

environment. The same peptide sequence may fold into either helix or sheet conformation. A proper coarse

graining of the 20 amino acids into fewer clusters for diﬀerent conformation is important for improving the

signal-to-noise ratio when extracting information by statistical means.

Based on the amino acid property for diﬀerent protein secondary structure, Robson established the GOR

[2] method for protein secondary structure prediction. And more, several other works are based on these

properties. But the diﬀerence of amino acid property is still not clear. It is our purpose to propose a scheme

to lay out the similarities of amino acid and to reduce the amino acid alphabets in diﬀerent conformation.

2 Production of amino acid distance matrices

It is reported that the homologous relationship can not been determined by alignment for two protein

sequences if their amino acid identical is no more than 35%. In order to get amino acid property excluding

the homologous information we used a nonredundant set of globular protein structure with sequence length

range from 80 to 420. This database is based on the list of PDB SELECT [3] with the amino acid identical less

than 25% published on March,1994 (ftp.cbi.pku.edu.cn/pub/ebi/database/pdb select/pdb select.mar 1994).

The secondary structure assignments were taken to be those provided by DSSP [4]database. The protein

secondary structure is rewrote as H→H, G→H, I→H, E→E, T→T, X→C, S→C, B→C.

Each amino acid connects with others in protein conformation.

In order to ﬁnd out the scope of an

amino acid aﬀects others, we calculate the Kullback-Liebler [6, 7, 8]distance between conditional probability

distribution p(aj|i) and background probability distribution p(a) for each position j by

Dj =

20

X
a=1

p(aj|i)ln(p(aj|i)/p(a)) + p(a)ln(p(a)/p(aj|i))

(1)

where a is the type of amino acid, i is the type of central amino acid . We calculate a 21 residues window

for each type of central amino acid. The background probability distribution is calculated from the amino

2

acid counts of the three positions on both end of the window.The results are shown in Figure 1, 2, 3 and 4.

It is found that the distance is long beside the central amino acid. The eﬀect of central amino acid is large

in 3 positions on both sides.

To characterize the property of amino acid, we deﬁne a 7 length proﬁle with the certain amino acid at the

center of the window. For each amino acid, we get four proﬁles according to the protein secondary structure

type of the central amino acid. Then, for each type of amino acid i, we get an conditional probability matrix

Aij

µν = p(µν|aa4 = i, ss4 = j),

µ = 1, 2, . . . , 20, ν = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7,

(2)

which means the amino acid probability distribution on each position of the window when the protein

secondary structure of the central amino acid is j. The conditional probability distribution is calculated

from the amino acid counts by

p(µν |aa4 = i, ss4 = j) =

f ′(µν|aa4 = i, ss4 = j)
f (aa4 = i, ss4 = j)

.

The sample number for each matrix is listed on Table I. Once we get the conditional probability matrices,

we can deﬁne the Kullback-Liebler distance between two amino acid α and β in protein secondary structure

θ and φ as

dθφ
αβ =

7

20

X
ν=1,ν6=4

X
µ=1

Aαθ

µν ln(Aαθ

µν /Aβφ

µν ) + Aβφ

µν ln(Aβφ

µν /Aαθ

µν),

which means the diﬀerence between the two probability distribution.

Starting from the amino acid counts of our database, we get the amino acid distance matrices for each

protein secondary structure. The results are shown in Table II, III, IV, V and VI.

3 Reduction of amino acid alphabets

The deﬁnition of amino acid distance can be used in amino acid classiﬁcation. First, we calculate the

amino acid distance for each pair of amino acid group. The minimum is selected and the central conditional

probability matrix for group γ is calculated as

p(µν |aa4 ∈ γ, ss4 = j) = Pi∈γ f ′(µν|aa4 = i, ss4 = j)
Pi∈γ f (aa4 = i, ss4 = j)

,

where the summation is taken over the amino acids in the group. Once we get the group center

µν = p(µν |aa4 ∈ γ, ss4 = j),

µ = 1, 2, . . . , 20, ν = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7,

3

we can do the classiﬁcation again. Consequently, we get a bottomup amino acid classiﬁcation scheme for

every protein secondary structure. The results are shown in Table VII, VIII, IX and X.

4 Discussion

In the above we have proposed a scheme to observe the distance between amino acids for diﬀerent protein

secondary structure. We compare our result with the BLOSUM62 matrix. There are many diﬀerent. For

example,the amino acid pair GT,HT and AY have negative score in BLOSUM62 score matrix, but their

distance is short in helix conformation. We observe these diﬀerences in NG, MQ YI, YL, YV, FV pairs in

sheet and RS, YH, FV pairs in coil too. And more, we ﬁnd the amino acid Cys(C) and Trp(W) have huge

diﬀerence to other amino acids in turn conformation. The distance is very long nearly to all of the others.

This means two of them are very special in turn conformation.

We can see the change of amino acid’s diﬀerence by comparing the distance matrices each other. For

example, the distance for CG pair in helix conformation is 6, 3 units bigger than in sheet conformation.

There are 27 such pairs which have a distance diﬀerence larger than three units between helix and sheet

conformation. So, the change of amino acid’s diﬀerence in diﬀerent conformation is obvious.

To ﬁnd the change of amino acid property in diﬀerent conformation, we calculate the distance matrix

for the same type of amino acid in diﬀerent protein secondary structure. We ﬁnd most of the distance is

larger than 10 units. There are several extraordinary amino acids mainly distribute in comparison of SHEET

with COIL and COIL with TURN. These extraordinary amino acids with distance less than 10 have less

diﬀerence in the corresponding two conformations. These may result in the diﬃcult for protein conformation

prediction, protein design and alignment etc.

The clustering based on diﬀerent conformation show an evident discrepancy from each other. For example,

Ala(A) groups with Gly(G) in helix as hydrophilic group, but they group in sheet as hydrophobic group.

Asp(D) groups with Asn(N) at ﬁrst stage in turn, but they group with each other in much later stage. We

can see that side chain is important for classiﬁcation of amino acid with conformation. ST, ILV, DN and

FY group at early state in special conformations. This give us a clue for observing the diﬀerence of amino

acid property in diﬀerent conformation.

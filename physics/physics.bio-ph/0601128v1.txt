Topological properties of native folds are obtained from statistical analysis of 160 low homology
proteins covering the four structural classes. This is done analysing one, two and three-vertex joint
distribution of quantities related to the corresponding network of amino acid residues. Emphasis on
the amino acid residue hydrophobicity leads to the deﬁnition of their center of mass as vertices in
this contact network model with interactions represented by edges. The network analysis helps us
to interpret experimental results such as hydrophobic scales and fraction of buried accessible surface
area in terms of the network connectivity. To explore the vertex type dependent correlations, we
build a network of hydrophobic and polar vertices. This procedure presents the wiring diagram
of the topological structure of globular proteins leading to the following attachment probabilities
between hydrophobic-hydrophobic 0.424(5), hydrophobic-polar 0.419(2) and polar-polar 0.157(3)
residues.

INTRODUCTION

It has long been recognized that limitations on mod-
eling proteins are due to the complexity of the intra-
molecular interactions and the lack of an adequate de-
scription of the interactions with the solvent [1]. The
complexity of the interactions has led to sophisticated
numerical simulations of all-atom models. Thus, it is
primordial to consider the basic features of the pro-
tein dynamics to obtain a reliable and less computation-
ally demanding working model to understand the folding
process and protein stability. Many theoretical models
have been proposed to the protein structure prediction
with reduced degrees of freedom [2]. This leads to a
coarse-grained approach where all-atom interactions are
replaced by centers of force.

Beyond the dynamical approach, many natural and ar-
tiﬁcial interacting systems have been modeled as a graph,
where vertices represent the system elements and edges
represent their interactions. In particular, some graphs
present scale free behavior and are called complex net-
works [3, 4, 5]. Theoretical studies have focused on the
understanding of their large-scale organization [6, 7] and
growing mechanism [8], possibly driven by evolutionary
principles [9, 10, 11].

In this view, networks of interacting amino acid pairs
have been constructed given the Cartesian coordinates
of the main chain α-carbon atoms as vertices. Edges are
established when any other Cα atom is within a cutoﬀ

Euclidean distance Rc [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Distances as
Rc = 8.5 ˚A [12, 13, 17] or Rc = 7.0 ˚A [14, 15], have been
taken to deﬁne a contact network of amino acids.

Another approach to model an amino acid network can
be devised if one considers the center of mass of their side
chains as vertices. Those centroids are obtained with
the heavy atoms spatial coordinates of the amino acid
residues and act as interaction sites. Again, a contact
network is deﬁned if a centroid is within an Euclidean
distance Rc = 8.5 ˚A of another one and this case is stud-
ied in this paper. This approach emphasizes the amino
acid residue hydrophobicity, which is the main force lead-
ing to a folded conformation [18, 19].

With this network modeling, following the work by
Greene and Higman [13], we are able to gather quan-
titative results characterizing the native conformation
topology of globular proteins. As we show, this proce-
dure helps us to rationalize the formation of native states
from a topological point of view. This is achieved with
a network description for the inter-residue interactions,
which helps to interpret experimental results such as hy-
drophobic scales and the fraction of buried accessible sur-
face area. Moreover, we evaluate the attachment proba-
bilities between hydrophobic-hydrophobic, hydrophobic-
polar and polar-polar residues from this simple network
model.

The deﬁnitions of the topological quantities used in
this paper are presented in Sec. II with the numerical
results followed by a discussion. The ﬁnal conclusions
are presented in Sec. III. Appendix A complements our
study through the distribution of inter-residue contacts.

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To explore the network model of globular proteins, sta-
tistical analysis have been carried out for networks built
from 160 high-resolution and low homology structures,
presenting diﬀerent folds and chain lengths [20], collected
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Chains with residues
omitted in the PDB database have not been included
in our data set. This avoids bias in the calculation of
topological quantities. Our data consist of four sets of 40
diﬀerent native-state conformations representing the four
broad structural classes, all-α, all-β, α + β and α/β ac-
cording to the SCOP classiﬁcation [21]. The selection of
protein structures has been made to permit a numerical
analysis of the dependence of network topological prop-
erties on secondary structure contents and their network
size N , i.e., the total number of amino acids.

Figure 1 shows an illustrative example of the network
structure with the vertices calculated from side chain cen-
troids for the protein 1E0L, collected in our all-β data
set.

A. One vertex analysis: mean network degree and
hydrophobicity scale

Figure 2 shows the average vertex (degree) connectiv-
ity hki for the four structural classes as a function of N .
It is obtained as an average over the connectivities ki,
where ki is the number of edges connecting the vertex i to
other vertices in the network. The value of hki increases
quickly for small proteins and shows an asymptotic trend
for all classes. This ﬁgure indicates a predominant lower
average connectivity for all-α conformations compared
with all other classes.

The typical hki for proteins are to be compared with
other biological systems [3]: S. cerevisiae protein-protein
network, hki = 2.39 and N = 1870; E. coli metabolic
network, hki = 7.4 and N = 778; neural network of C.
elegans, hki = 14 and N = 282; Silwood Park food web,
hki = 4.75 and N = 154; Ythan estuary food web, hki =
8.7 and N = 134.

A protein mapping onto a contact network clearly in-
troduces constraints on the network topological proper-
ties. The ﬁrst one is due to the ﬁnite size of real data,
which introduces a cutoﬀ degree depending on N [22].
Second, size and steric considerations introduce a more
relevant constraint in the topology of amino acid net-
works, for example, limiting the possible values for the
degree k. Thus, the degree dependence must be charac-
terized by a limiting ﬁnite value for the maximum degree
kmax, irrespective of the chain size. This can be observed
for our data sets in the inset of Figure 2. The hitting of
the maximum degree of a vertex can be translated as
performance of how to connect vertices in the folding
process. Once this value is reached, the network rewires
edges connected to that vertex or stops this speciﬁc ver-
tex dependent process.

sponding network with their numbered vertices representing
the center of mass of the side chains. This ﬁgure was drawn

This conclusion is also reinforced by a similar study
carried out by Vendruscolo et al. [12] with the “betwee-
ness” Bi, which correlates with k2
i , when comparing na-
tive and Monte Carlo generated transition states. As ex-
plicitly demonstrated for six proteins, highly connected
residues in the native state may not correspond to the
highly connected ones (key residues) in the transition
states.

for each network as a function of N .

Protein structure is sequence dependent. Thus, diﬀer-
ent of other real network models, where vertices are in
general considered to be of the same type we are dealing
with systems, which result from the intrinsic properties
of the amino acid residues.

To obtain a deeper insight of the role played by each
residue in forming native conformations, we investigate
how to relate their character to the ability of making
contacts with other residues. For this end, we display
in Fig. 3 the average connectivity for each residue one-
letter code from all 160 structures, taking into account
the number of times each residue appears in all sequences.
The sequence of amino acid residues displayed in Fig-
ure 3 was chosen because it groups their characteristics:
aliphatic non-hydrogen-bonding (Gly, Ala, Pro, Val, Ile,
Leu), aromatic non-hydrogen-bonding (Phe), sulfur con-
taining (Met, Cys) and hydrogen-bonding (Trp, Tyr, His,
Thr, Ser, Gln, Asn, Glu, Asp, Lys, Arg) [23].

Figure 3a shows a clear trend for lower average connec-
tivity played by amino acid residues in proteins classiﬁed
in all-α structural class. Nevertheless, the highest av-
erage connectivity is presented by residues in the α/β
protein class. This class has mixed α-helices and par-
allel β-strands. Intermediary pattern of connectivity is
found for residues in all-β and α + β protein classes with
predominant higher connectivity for the β class. There-
fore, it is likely that the higher average connectivity for
the residues in α/β class also comes from interactions
among residues in diﬀerent secondary structures. The
α + β class presents regions of α-helices and anti-parallel
β-strands largely segregated along the chain. We also
conclude that the connectivity in this protein class re-
sults mainly from contacts among the elements in each
secondary structure type. Figure 3b shows the average
connectivity of each residue calculated from all networks

considered in our data set, stressing their general ability
of making network contacts.

Can we relate this ability to any intrinsic amino acid
property? In the following, we argue that those sharp
evaluated average values can be understood in terms of
the concept of hydrophobicity.

We recall that the hydrophobic eﬀect concept as the
leading force in folding globular proteins comes from ex-
perimental evidences. This is illustrated by the ﬁnd-
ing of mostly non-polar residues in the core of protein
structures [18, 19] as a consequence of avoiding the ex-
posure to water of amino acids with hydrophobic side
chains. Therefore, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic charac-
ter of amino acids has been viewed as an important is-
sue in understanding the formation of native structures.

For example, the spatial distribution of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic residues has led to the deﬁnition of score
functions based on hydrophobic proﬁles as a mean to
detect native protein folding among many decoy struc-
tures [24, 25].

In spite of many scales ranking the hydrophobic char-
acter, due mainly to the particular measurement method,
there is a consensus about the more hydrophobic (Phe,
Ile, Leu, Val) and more hydrophilic (Lys, Arg, Asp, Glu)
residues. Therefore, one expects to obtain more (less)
connected vertices as the ones ranked in the top (bot-
tom) of the hydrophobic scales.

To investigate how the average network connectivity
(shown in Figure 3b) is related to the hydrophobic char-
acter of residues, we have checked its correlation with the
127 scales collected in Ref. [26]. The most signiﬁcant cor-
relations are observed with the well known scales in the
literature: Kyte and Doolittle, Juretic et al. and Janin-
2, all presenting correlation coeﬃcient ρ = 0.94; Taylor
and Thornton (ρ = 0.93) and Sereda et al.-2 (ρ = 0.92),
following the notation for these scales as in Table I of
Ref. [26]. On the other hand, non-signiﬁcant correlations
are obtained with the scales: Hopp (ρ = 0.10); Wilce
et al.-3 (ρ = 0.14); Michel et al., Colonna-Cesari and
Sander (ρ = 0.21).

Although we can ﬁnd a very good agreement between
the amino acid hydrophobic caracter and its average con-
nectivity, Figure 3(a) clearly shows that this quantitative
character is related to the secondary structure contents.
Yet, this has experimental consequences on the deﬁni-
tion of the free energy transfer. Therefore, any method
used to predict elements of secondary structure based on
typical hydrophobicity proﬁles need to be reconsidered.
Those quantitative values are expected to be correlated
to the exposure pattern of the amino acids to the aqueous
environment. This can be readly investigated considering
only the average connectivity and the available data on
individual amino acid accesible surface area (independent
of its location in a peptide).

Our results show that the average connectivity reveals
a weak correlation with the average buried accessible sur-
face area (ASA) A0 − hAi (ρ = 0.39) [27, 28], where A0 is
ASA calculation based on Gly-X-Gly models related to
the unfolded state and hAi is an average ASA calculated
from native protein structures. However, the correlation
coeﬃcient increases to 0.90 for the fraction of buried ASA
1 − hAi/A0, which reﬂects the relative loss of their acces-
sible surface areas during the folding process.

B. Two vertices analysis: assortativity

So far we have focused the discussion from a single ver-
tex point of viewing. However, many real-world networks
also exhibit degree correlations [29, 30], i.e., the condi-
tional probability P (k′|k) that an edge leaving from a
vertex, with degree k, and arriving at a vertex, with de-
gree k′, is dependent on k.

4

This two-vertices correlation is expressed by knn(k) =
Pk′ k′ P (k′|k) and furnishes the average connectivity
of the nearest neighbors of vertices with connectivity
k [30, 31, 32]. Concerning this aspect, the networks are
classiﬁed as to show assortative mixing, if the degree cor-
relation is positive, a preference for high-degree vertices
to attach to other high-degree vertices, or disassortative
mixing, otherwise. Therefore, whenever knn(k) increases
with k, one obtains a correlated network, thus showing
an assortative mixing. On the other hand, a decreasing
behavior as a function of k shows a disassortative mixing.
Our numerical analysis of the two-vertices correlation
shows that the dependency of knn(k) on the degree k can
be described by a linear relation for all our networks (data
not shown), knn(k) = a + b k, with a, b > 0. Moreover,
this result leads to the average of knn(k) over all vertices,
hknniN = Pk P (k)knn(k), where P (k) is the observed
degree distribution of each network, to have also a linear
behavior as a function of hki because hki = Pk kP (k).

We depict in Figure 4 the behavior of hknniN as a
function of N and of the structural classes. We observe
again a stationary value for large N , reﬂecting what
we can call the main property of amino acid residue
network.
In fact, that homogeneous network behav-
ior (hknniN ∼ hki) is supported by the inset of Fig-
ure 4. The linear regression for the 160 proteins leads
to hknniN = 0.65(7) + 1.012(7)hki, with correlation co-
eﬃcient ρ = 0.99. Therefore, there is a strict correspon-
dence, exhibited by the above equation, between the way
hknniN and the average degree hki grow with N . As a
matter of fact, this can also be noted a posteriori by
the similarity between the positions of the data points
in Figures 2 and 4. This reveals a speciﬁc pattern of at-
tachments among vertices for all network sizes, and it is
further explored below.

We recall that, although we observe a linear increasing
of knn(k) with k, this behavior is only valid up to k ∼
kmax due to physical constraints of the networks.

C. Hydrophobic and hydrophylic vertices and their
correlation

So far, we have reinforced the observed process to-
ward some high-connected vertices as the ﬁnal result
of the protein folding within its biological time. How-
ever protein folding corresponds to a speciﬁc mecha-
nism of wiring in contrast to the collapse of homopoly-
mers, likely due to the key residues in according to the
nucleation-condensation model as a highly cooperative
process [12, 33].

To explore further the role played by the connectivity
of residues leading to the assortative mixing behavior we
re-deﬁne our networks as being composed of two types
of residues, denoted by H and P . H residues are chosen
as the more connected ones in Figure 3b and P residues
otherwise, in such way to obtain two data sets of 11 and 9
residues, roughly corresponding to the three more corre-
lated scales we have identiﬁed in Sec. II A. This makes a
set for H type residues including Thr as being the lowest
hydrophobic and another one for P type residues start-
ing with Ser. Diﬀerently from bipartite networks, where
edges connect only vertices of unlike type, our new net-
works have edges connecting vertices irrespective of their
type. Now, to proceed the investigation on how the as-
sortativity arises in native structures we apply the ideas
of community forming by Newman [34].
In this sense,
we search a better comprehension of the assortativity
as consequence of a mechanism for network formation,
which results from preferential attachments among spe-
ciﬁc residues. Firstly, we quantify the observed assorta-
tive mixing calculating the fraction of edges eij between
vertices of type i and j (i, j = {H, P }). Table I presents
the averaged values with their standard deviations for
the fraction of edges in each structural class and the ﬁ-
nal averages from all data, with eHP = eP H. It is clear
the preference for attachments between H −H and H −P
vertices. Secondly, we calculate the assortativity coeﬃ-
cient [29, 34] r, a correlation coeﬃcient which lies in the
range [0, 1]. This coeﬃcient hits the value 1 for perfect
assortative mixing, i.e. when every edge connects vertices
of the same type, and the minimum value 0 for a random
mixing. The low numerical values for r in Table I tak-
ing into account their standard deviations conﬁrms that
there is almost no assortative mixing by type, i.e. H − H
and P − P attachments. Hence, the network surrounding
residue of type H is likely to be another H or P , with
probabilities presented in Table I. We may interpret those
sharp probabilities as the result of a compositional equi-
librium of H and P residues in globular proteins. With
our hydrophobic scale deﬁned in terms of hki we calculate
how dominant the presence of H residues is. For all-α
class we obtain 0.549 ± 0.007; all-β, 0.569 ± 0.008; α + β,

5

0.559 ± 0.007 and α/β, 0.579 ± 0.006.

Although the tendency of H residues to connect among
themselves and with P residues is a well known fact,
this approach presents a manner to quantify the pref-
erential attachment associated to globular proteins. Fur-
thermore, the tuning of energy couplings in minimal
model simulations may proﬁt from this residue attach-
ment quantiﬁcation in order to be more realistic in de-
scribing the folding process.

From a graph point of view, attachment probabilities
reveal the wiring diagram when including diﬀerent kinds
of vertices as a mechanism for network formation. Those
probabilities also discard the simple picture of a predom-
inant hydrophobic core. Our results help to form the
image that an H vertex brings along other H vertices as
well as other P vertices in forming the native structure.
Table I also shows the fraction of edges eij for all
classes as a function of three typical ranges of protein
sizes N . It is interesting to note that when one restricts
the analysis for chain sizes in those ranges, the fractions
eij in each range are still comparable within the standard
deviations. This conﬁrms the robust pattern of network
formation irrespective of their size.

D. Three vertices analysis: non-random pattern

To support the above speciﬁc attachment among
{H, P } residues, we have evaluated the clustering coeﬃ-
cient hCi over all vertices. While the average connectivity
gives information on how connected a vertex is, the clus-
tering coeﬃcient shows the network transitivity, i.e., the
probability that two nearest neighbors of a given vertex
are nearest neighbors themselves [6], forming a triangle
with this vertex. Notice that, in this aspect, the cluster-
ing coeﬃcient is a measure of three-vertices correlation.
The maximum value of hCi is 1 in a fully connected net-
work, it assumes the value hki/N for a random network
and it is constant for regular lattices [35]. Our results for
hCi as a function of N for the structural classes exclude
any random character in its formation (See Figure 5) as
already pointed out [12, 13] without including any size
dependence analysis.

Next, we look at the distribution of inter-residue con-
tacts from a network perspective. However, since the
main results of this distribution are already known in
the literature, we have left them to the appendix. We
include this appendix to show that network modelling
distinguishes molecular chains with secondary structures
from polymers and to present a comprehensive study of
the topological properties of globular proteins.

III. CONCLUSION

Diﬀerent from the usual network analysis dedicated to
study the properties of a single system, we try to infer the
main topological features of a class of systems (globular

proteins) characterized by an unknown mechanism which
drive them to speciﬁc tridimensional conﬁgurations, the
native structures.

Topological parameters have been obtained to charac-
terize native structures and their organization pattern as
a result of the underlying dynamical process of forma-
tion. Our main results permit the following theoretical
conclusions: (i) the average number of edges leaving a
given center of force presents a direct relation with the
hydrophobic character of the residues and to their frac-
tion of buried accessible surface area; (ii) the way this
average number of edges (center of forces) grows with
the protein chain size is also reproduced in the formation
of inter-residue interactions among the nearest neighbors
of that center of force; (iii) the interactions among spe-
ciﬁc residues exhibit a well deﬁned pattern described by
the results presented in Table I. The above patterns re-
main, irrespective of the protein size, and this may shed
light on the protein evolution.

APPENDIX A: DISTRIBUTION OF
INTER-RESIDUE CONTACTS

There is still another important aspect to be consid-
ered: the attachments distribution in our networks com-
pared to a full connected one, as driven by bonded and
non-bonded forces from inter-residue interactions. This
can be translated as a topological pattern of inter-residue
contacts categorized into short-, medium- and long-range
interactions. Short-range interaction contributions corre-
spond to residues within a distance of two residues from
each other, medium range to the ones within a distance
of 3 or 4 residues and long-range contribution is deﬁned
to come from more than 4 residues away [36]. Figure 6
presents the average relative number of observed inter-
residue contacts as a function of its sequence separation
|i − j| between residues i and j along the main chain. It
is deﬁned as the ratio of the observed number of contacts
at distance |i − j| and its maximum number for the full
connected network, i.e. with N (N − 1)/2 edges. This
ﬁgure shows that the main contribution comes from the
ﬁrst four neighbors, i.e., from short- and medium-range
contacts, reﬂecting the chain connectivity property. In
particular, for all-α chains, we see that from all possible
contacts at distance 1, only 90.2% occur; at distance 2,
43.9%; at distance 3, 60.6%; at distance 4, 52.2%; drop-
ping to 11.8% and 7.7% at distances 5 and 6, respectively.
Comparing all classes, the short-range contacts present
similar relative numbers. Large relative number (but less
than 1) of contacts at distance 1 means that the chain
connectivity between successive residues (i, i + 1) is not

always enforced due to our deﬁnition of cutoﬀ distance
Rc among side chain center of mass.

a function of the sequence separation |i − j|. Results are
obtained for the four structural classes of proteins with N ≥
200.

We observe a preference for medium-range contacts by
all-α structures and a very low preference by all-β. The
highest relative number of contacts for all-α at distance 3
reveals the pattern of helices characterized by the (i, i+3)
contacts. Classes α + β and α/β present similar aver-
age relative number of observed inter-residue contacts.
It is clear the preference of long-range contacts for all-β
structures, mainly compared with all-α structures. This
overall behavior reveals how vertices related to secondary
structures interact in a network of amino acids as a func-
tion of the sequence separation.

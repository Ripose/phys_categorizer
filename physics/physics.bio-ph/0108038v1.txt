The macroscopic curvature of double helical DNA induced
by regularly repeated adenine tracts (A-tracts) is well-known
but still puzzling.
Its physical origin remains controversial
even though it is perhaps the best-documented sequence mod-
ulation of DNA structure. In order to shed some light upon
this problem we were looking for relevant sequence motives
that could spontaneously induce stable bends in DNA dur-
ing molecular dynamics simulations. Such motif has been
localized in the bending center of the kinetoplast body of
Leishmania tarentolae which is the ﬁrst bent DNA fragment
investigated in vitro twenty years ago. We report here the
results of comparative theoretical and experimental studies
of bending dynamics in 35-mer DNA fragments. This length
appears large enough for the curvature to be distinguished by
gel electrophoresis. Two DNA fragments, with identical base
pair composition, but diﬀerent sequences are compared. In
the ﬁrst one, a single A-tract motif was four times repeated in
phase with the helical screw whereas the second sequence was
”random”. Both calculations and experiments indicate that
the A-tract DNA is distinguished by the large static curvature
and characteristic bending dynamics. These results conﬁrm
that the A-tract induced bending reproduced in simulations
corresponds to the experimental phenomenon. They question
the earlier views that attributed a decisive role in the mecha-
nism of DNA bending to sequence speciﬁc base pair stacking
or binding of solvent counterions. At the same time, our re-
sults support the hypothesis of a compressed frustrated state
of the backbone as the principal physical cause of the static
curvature.

INTRODUCTION

It is now generally accepted that the double helical
DNA can adopt speciﬁc local structural forms deﬁned
by its base pair sequence. The simplest such form is
a bend. Natural static curvature was discovered nearly
twenty years ago in DNA containing regular repeats of
AnTm, with n+m > 3, called A-tracts1,2. Since then this
intriguing phenomenon has been actively studied, with
several profound reviews of the results published in dif-
ferent years3,4,5,6,7,8. Every A-tract slightly deviates the
helical axis towards its minor groove, which results in
signiﬁcant macroscopic curvature when local bends are
properly phased. The physical origin of this eﬀect re-
mains a matter of debate in spite of considerable eﬀorts
spent in attempts to clarify it. This problem is of general

1

importance because the accumulated large volume of ap-
parently paradoxical observations on the subject points
to our lack of understanding of some fundamental as-
pects that may be essential for the ﬁne structure and the
biological function of the DNA molecule.

A variety of theoretical approaches were earlier used
to solve the puzzle of DNA bending9,10,11,12,13,14. To
be informative, such methods should not be biased by
a priori empirical knowledge of key structural features
and must rely only upon generic atom-atom interactions.
Free molecular dynamics (MD) is one of such methods,
but straightforward attempts to study DNA bending in
MD encounter serious obstacles. Even with a perfectly
accurate model, the computer time necessary to obtain
a statistically signiﬁcant sampling of curved conforma-
tions may not be aﬀordable. Moreover, perfectly accurate
models do not yet exist, therefore, experimental eﬀects
may not appear even during inﬁnitely long MD.

To circumvent these diﬃculties, we employed a diﬀer-
ent strategy. We ﬁrst looked for, and found a short A-
tract motif that could reproducibly induce stable bends
in DNA during a few nanoseconds of MD. By repeat-
ing this motif we constructed longer double helices with
intrinsic curvature in silico. The ﬁrst results of our ef-
forts reported recently15,16 turned out rather surprising.
The curvature observed in calculations reasonably agreed
with experimental data, but was in qualitative disagree-
ment with all earlier views of its possible physical origin.
To explain these observations a new hypothetical mech-
anism of bending was proposed which we consider here
later. However, the relatively small DNA lengths used
in simulations precluded a reliable experimental veriﬁ-
cation of bending, and one could not exclude that the
observed eﬀect was of a diﬀerent origin than that found
in experiments. To make possible a direct comparison we
increased the length of the A-tract repeat by one helical
turn. The length of 35 bp still allows us to continue MD
trajectories until spontaneous development of static cur-
vature. At the same time, with this chain length, straight
and bent oligomers become distinguishable in gel migra-
tion experiments.

Figure 1a displays the step-by-step construction of the
DNA fragments in question. Originally, we took a 15-
mer from the bending center in Fig. 1a, which is the ﬁrst
curved DNA locus studied in vitro,2 and found that dur-
ing MD its minor groove has stable narrow proﬁle along
the left-hand A-tract but not along the right one. This

The A-tracts are numbered and their centers are separated
by approximately 10bp. The reference random fragment has
the same base pair content as the 35-mer repeat, but its se-
quence has been manually reshuﬄed to exclude any A-tract
motives. (b) Gel mobility assay. The two 32P-labeled 35 bp
DNA constructs (At and nAt) were electrophoresed in 16%
plyacrylamide gel buﬀered with Tris-borate, pH 8.6. The gel

and At+nAt correspond to the A-tract repeat, the random

might be due to an intrinsic diﬀerence between 3’- and 5’-
end A-tracts. Therefore, taking into account that inver-
sion of A-tracts does not aﬀect bending in experiments17,
the “good” A-tract was inverted and the sequence con-
tinued by using the same AAAATAG motif. In the se-
ries of fragments thus obtained, spontaneous static cur-
vature emerged reliably in repeated simulations and it
became more evident as the chain length increased. To
obtain a non-A-tract reference DNA fragment we have
reshuﬄed manually base pairs of the A-tract repeat. We
preferred this randomized sequence to commonly used
GC-rich straight fragments in order to keep the base pair
content identical and reduce the noise that could cause
small variations in gel mobility and hide the subtle dif-
ferences we were going to detect.

The two 35-mer DNA fragments shown in Fig. 1a were
compared in silico and in vitro. For the A-tract repeat,
trajectories starting from canonical straight conforma-
tions converged to a single statically bent state. The
curvature is planar and the molecule is bent towards the
narrowed minor grooves at 3’ ends of A-tracts. The mag-
nitude of bending agrees with experimental estimates.
The “random” fragment was not straight as well, but its
curvature was much less signiﬁcant and less planar. In gel
migration assays the two oligomers produce well-resolved
distinct bands, with the A-tract sequence demonstrat-
ing a reduced mobility characteristic of curved DNA. All
these observations suggest that the A-tract induced DNA
bending obtained in calculations corresponds to the ex-
perimental phenomenon.

The bending observed in simulations cannot be caused
by phosphate neutralization and it apparently is not due
to local sequence speciﬁc stacking interactions. In con-
trast, the compressed backbone hypothesis15 oﬀers a con-
sistent interpretation to all the data. This theory postu-
lates that, in physiological conditions, the equilibrium
speciﬁc length of the sugar-phosphate backbone in DNA
is larger than that in the canonical B-form. It is com-
pressed and pushes stacked base pairs, forcing them to
increase helical twist and rise, which is opposed by the
stacking energy. As a result, the backbone deviates from
its regular spiral trace in an ideal double helix. It wanders
along the helical surface causing quasi-sinusoidal modu-
lations of DNA grooves. Concomitant base stacking per-
turbations result in macroscopic static curvature when
certain properties of base pairs alternate along the se-
quence in phase with the helical screw.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We describe four long trajectories, namely, two inde-
pendent runs starting from either A- or B- canonical
DNA forms for each of the two 35-mer sequences shown
in Fig. 1a. They are referred to as At-A, At-B, nAt-
A, and nAt-B, where At and nAt stand for A-tract and
non-A-tract fragment, respectively, while the last char-

acterize the overall DNA shape. The plates are grouped in
raws for the same trajectory and in columns for the same pa-
rameter. The ﬁrst column displays the non-hydrogen atom
rmsd (in angstr¨oms) from the ﬁber canonical B-DNA.19 The
bending angle shown in the second column is measured be-
tween the two ends of the curved helical axis (in degrees).
The shortening is the percent ratio of the length of the curved
axis to its end-to-end distance minus 100%. The traces were

would give a plane in the Y projection and a curved sur-
face in the X projection. It is seen that after the 13th
nanosecond in At-A the overall curvature drastically in-
creased and stabilized at a higher level than before. A
similar qualitative change occurred in At-B after about
3 ns (see Fig. 2).
In contrast, it is seen that in both
nAt trajectories the curvature remained all the time at
a level similar to that in At-A and At-B before the tran-
sitions. The nAt pattern displayed in Fig. 3 probably
corresponds to a generic type of dynamics characteristic
of arbitrary 35-mer DNA fragments.

acter indicates the starting state as A- or B-forms. The
MD simulations have been carried out with the minimal
model of B-DNA,20,21 which makes possible a signiﬁcant
reduction of the number of water molecules involved in
calculations. All trajectories were continued to 20 ns ex-
cept At-B which was stopped at about 12 ns because
it had clearly converged long before. The details of the
computational and experimental protocols are described
in Methods.

Main Helical Characteristics of Computed
Structures

The minimal B-DNA model has been earlier applied
to a large variety of DNA sequences.20,21,22 It is very
stable dynamically and usually gives B-DNA structures
that are closer to experimental standards than with any
other simulation technique. It was not surprising, there-
fore, that the four trajectories in question remained all
the time within the B-DNA family, with the average he-
lical parameters being very close to the common B-DNA
values. Table I shows some relevant helical characteris-
tics of the ﬁnal 1ns-average conformations and compares
them with the canonical DNA forms. The four com-
puted structures have remarkably similar average heli-
coidals corresponding to a typical B-DNA. In contrast,
the rms deviations from the canonical A- and B-DNA
forms strongly vary.

As shown in Fig. 2 the rmsd from the canonical B-
DNA was similar and rather low during the ﬁrst few
nanoseconds in all four trajectories.
It quickly leveled
at around 4 ˚A reaching these values from above or form
below for the A-DNA and B-DNA starts, respectively.
A remarkable diﬀerence in the rmsd dynamics is seen
between the A-tract and non-A-tract DNA. In the ﬁrst
case, after some time its value suddenly increased and
stabilized at a higher level of around 6 ˚A. No such char-
acteristic transition occurred in the two nAt trajectories.
The origin of this diﬀerence is analyzed in Fig. 3. They
display dynamics of the overall DNA shape by using two
orthogonal projections of the helical axis. A planar bend

Figure 2 also shows the time evolution of the bend-
ing angle and the axis shortening. Comparison of the
three columns of plots indicates that large and long-living
ﬂuctuations always occurred simultaneously in all three
parameters, which means that the rmsd diﬀerence from
the canonical B-form is largely caused by bending. The
values of rmsd from B-DNA reported in Table I are actu-
ally much larger than would be for straight conformations
with the same helical parameters. For instance, the rmsd
between the At-A and At-B structures in Table I was 2.3
˚A only because, as we show below, they were bent in the
same direction.

Convergence of Trajectories

The concept of static DNA bending implies that there
exists a bent structure corresponding to a free energy
minimum, therefore, MD trajectories are expected to be
trapped and stay in such state. The question is, however,
how long a real MD trajectory should ﬂuctuate around
a bent conformation to be representative. Recent exper-
imental results suggest that bending dynamics in DNA
fragments of only 100 base pairs may involve relaxation
times longer than a microsecond24, that is similar to the
protein folding times. Therefore, no practical procedure
exists to prove rigorously that any computed conforma-
tion is representative for our model system. Neverthe-
less, if several trajectories converge to the same state
from very diﬀerent starting points, one can argue that
this state is an attractor in the conformational space,
which is a necessary condition of the static curvature.
The reciprocal convergence of trajectories starting from
canonical A- and B-DNA, therefore, is a very important
aspect of these simulations. In our conditions, the tran-
sition from A- to B-DNA occurs during the ﬁrst 100 ps
of simulation. We did not try to equilibrate the initial
A-DNA states and did not mean to model this transition
realistically. The start form the A-form is important be-
cause it provides an independent dynamic assay with a
very diﬀerent entry to the B-DNA family, which allows
one to verify convergence of trajectories to speciﬁc con-
formations.

The rmsd comparison between At-A and At-B is shown
in Fig. 5. It clearly demonstrates that At-A and At-B
trajectories managed to come very close to each other
even though their starting points were signiﬁcantly sepa-
rated in conformational space. The initial rmsd of 10.7 ˚A
between the canonical 35-mer A- and B-DNA forms even-
tually went down to as low as 1.3 ˚A. The ﬁnal fall of the
rmsd occurred when the curvature drastically increased
(compare Figs. 2 and 5). Moreover, during the last
nanoseconds the bending direction was virtually identi-
cal in At-A and At-B and essentially ﬁxed at around 90◦
(see Fig. 4b), which makes clear the origin of the black
rectangle in the upper right corner of Fig. 5. According
to Fig. 4a this direction corresponds to bending towards

ends of this space curve are ﬁxed at the Z-axis of the global
coordinate frame, and it is rotated around OZ to put the
middle point in plane XOZ. The bending direction is mea-
sured by the angle ϕ between plane XOZ and the J vector of
the conventional local DNA coordinate frame.23 This vector
points to the major DNA groove along the short axis of the

scale covered by our simulations.

Smooth Modulations of the Minor Groove

Dynamics of the minor groove proﬁles is shown in Fig.
6. There are evident qualitative resemblance as well as
some subtle diﬀerences between these four surfaces. In
At-B, the characteristic regular groove shape has estab-
lished early, with signiﬁcant widenings in the three zones
between the A-tracts. The very left widening is some-
what diﬀerent probably because it occurs between anti-
parallel A-tracts. In At-A, the proﬁle strongly evolved at
the beginning, but in the end almost all local widenings
and narrowings coincide in At-A and At-B, although the
details are still somewhat diﬀerent in the middle.

For the A-tract repeat, the minor groove modulations
represent an expected feature connected to bending be-
cause various experimental data consistently suggest that
minor grooves of A-tracts progressively narrow from 5’-
end toward 3’-end.25 In contrast, the qualitatively similar
pattern obtained for the random sequence looks counter-
intuitive. However, this behavior is exactly what one
should expect if the waving of the backbone results from
its intrinsic compression15. In this case, the groove mod-
ulations should occur regardless of the base pair sequence
and their characteristic wave lengths should be deter-
mined by the backbone stiﬀness as well as overall helical
pitch and diameter. This explains why the waves in the
left-hand and the right-hand plates in Fig. 6 have roughly
similar scales, even though only the A-tract sequence is
periodical. The base pair sequence certainly aﬀects this
waving, notably, it can determine the ﬁne minor groove
structure and in A-tract repeats it ﬁxes the phases of
groove modulations.

The Magnitude and The Character of Bending

The experimental magnitude of bending produced by
A-tracts was earlier estimated by several groups with
diﬀerent approaches.26,27,28,29 The reported bend an-
gles were between 11◦ and 28◦ per A-tract, and 18◦ is
presently considered as the most reasonable estimate8.
The curvature somewhat varies with the base pair se-
quence and depends upon environmental conditions such
as the temperature, the concentration of counterions etc.
Although in calculations all these details cannot yet be
properly taken into account a quantitative comparison
with experiment is instructive.

ﬁrst averaged over of 50 and 25 ps intervals in At-A and At-B,
respectively, and the resulting structures compared between
the trajectories. Darker shading implies smaller rmsd values.
The lower left corner corresponds to the initial structures,
that is the canonical A- and B-forms, with rmsd about 10.7
˚A. The shaded rectangle in the upper right corner demon-
strates convergence of the two trajectories to the same bent
state. The values above 4 ˚A are not shaded whereas in the
darkest zones it falls down to 1.3 ˚A. The black vertical band
at approximately 10 ns indicates that At-A shortly visited
the ﬁnal state 3 ns before the deﬁnite transition. This short
period is distinguished by the increased curvature in Fig. 3
as well.

the minor groove at approximately three base pair steps
from the middle GC pair, that is at the 3’ end of the third
A-tract in Fig. 1a. All these data evidence that trajec-
tories At-A and At-B arrived at the same statically bent
state. Taking into account the separation between the
starting points one should reasonably conclude that this
state represents a strong attractor of trajectories with
a meta-basin of attraction comprising both canonical A
and B DNA forms.

The nAt trajectories exhibit qualitatively diﬀerent fea-
tures. The rmsd comparison of any two long intervals of
nAt-A and nAt-B gives ﬂuctuations between 3 and 6 ˚A
without any clear time trend. Figure 2 shows that, both
in nAt-A and nAt-B, the rmsd from B-DNA also ﬂuctu-
ated between 3 and 6 ˚A. The random fragment was not
straight and its rmsd dynamics evidently correlates with
bending (see Figs. 2, 3, and 4b). Apparently, rmsd be-
low 6 ˚A corresponds to a diﬀerence between two slightly
curved 35-mer B-DNA fragments with similar helical pa-
rameters but diﬀerent bending directions. The curvature
was usually weak, but it was evidently static because,
even with less than 2% shortening and bend angles below
10◦, the bending direction maintained in two rather nar-
row intervals in nAt-A and nAt-B. These directions were
slightly diﬀerent, but neither diverged nor converged, re-
maining at around 100◦ from each other. Such pattern
suggests that the molecule prefers bent shapes to the
straight one, but there is more than one possible bend,

When the curvature has established, that is after 13
ns of dynamics in At-A and after 3 ns in At-B, the bend
angle oscillated around 60◦(see Fig. 2). In the consec-
utive 1ns-averaged conformations its value was between
42◦ and 74◦, with the average of 54◦ for 16 such struc-
tures. This value corresponds to 54/4=13.5◦ per A-tract,
that is close to the lower experimental estimate. A larger
value of 54/3=18◦ results, however, if one assumes, as
suggested by some experimental observations17,31,32 that
the A-tracts are straight, and that the bending actually
occurs in the three junction zones between them. Yet
another estimate can be obtained from earlier studies
of bending in the similar 25-mer repeat with three A-
tracts15. Comparison of average bending angles in these
two fragments shows that one additional A-tract and
junction zone increase the overall bend by 20-22◦. We
see that the magnitude of bending in simulations is rather
close to experimental estimates, and that the agreement
is better if the curvature is really localized in the junction
zones between A-tracts.

The ﬁnal 1ns-average structure of At-A shown in Fig.
3 is less curved than other such averages, with the overall
bending angle of only 42.3◦. Figure 7 presents a closer
look at how the local curvature is distributed in the last
1-ns average structure of At-B. Its overall bending angle
is about 50◦, but it is seen that this value is less than
that for some its internal fragments. Three zones con-
tribute more than other to the overall bend. The two
junction zones between A-tracts 2, 3 and 4 are bent in
an identical direction which is close to that of the whole
structure. Together they contribute around 40◦ to the to-
tal bend, which is the largest local positive contribution.
In contrast, the strongly curved fourth A-tract makes a
negative contribution because its direction diverges by
more than 90◦. The third A-tract is virtually straight.
Finally, A-tracts 1 and 2 and the junction zone between
them also exhibit low local curvature. However, it has a
well deﬁned stable direction and this smoothly bent frag-
ment contributes the remaining 20◦ of the overall bend.
The foregoing analysis certainly is not free from pit-
falls. One may note, for instance, that the apparent
smooth curvature can result from time averaging of sev-
eral alternative local bends. Also, some smoothing is
inevitable in the algorithm that constructs the curved
helical axis. Nevertheless, Fig. 7 suggests that there
are zones in this DNA fragment that on average are bent
more than other and that two such zones are distinguish-
able between A-tracts. Figure 7c displays the local bend-
ing dynamics in At-B. It is seen that the main features
noticed in the last 1-ns average structure were quite vis-
ible during the whole trajectory. Moreover, the zone be-
tween the ﬁrst two A-tracts also sometimes carried an
increased curvature which was, however, smoothed down
during the last few nanoseconds. Interestingly, the max-
ima of local curvature often coincide with the slopes in
the proﬁle of the minor groove in Fig. 6.

The pattern in Fig. 7c agrees with the conclusions
earlier made by Dickerson et al based upon analysis of

X-ray structures, namely, that A-tracts are less prone to
bending than other sequences32. It is also perfectly ac-
counted for by the compressed backbone hypothesis that
oﬀers a simple mechanism of bending to major groove
in any minor groove widening15. Nevertheless, we sup-
pose it would be premature to generalize this conclusion
and suggest that bends towards the minor groove are
impossible. A-tracts are special because they can accom-
modate the narrowings of the minor groove symmetri-
cally, by increasing the helical twist and propeller.
In
other sequences, the narrowings caused by the backbone
compression can perhaps result in qualitatively diﬀerent
stacking perturbations with predominance of a negative
roll and bending towards the minor groove.

Gel Migration Experiments

The sequence induced static DNA curvature was ﬁrst
noticed owing to reduced migration rate of curved DNA
fragments in gel electrophoresis1. Later gel migration
studies gave a wealth of information on curvature in
A-tract repeats8. The diﬀerence in gel mobility be-
tween straight and curved DNA rapidly grows with chain
length, therefore, the curvature was usually studied in
rather long DNA fragments. Data for sequences shorter
than 50 bp are rare33, and, to our best knowledge, it has
never been shown that curved and straight 35-mers could
be distinguished. Nevertheless, subtle sequence eﬀects in
double stranded oligomers of around 10 bp were detected
with higher gel concentration34, and one could hope that
this would work for somewhat longer sequences as well.
Alternatively, the eﬀect of bending could be enhanced
by inserting the curved fragment in question into a long
stretch of straight DNA2, but we considered preferable
that the molecules compared in simulations and experi-
ments were exactly identical.

Figure 1b shows comparison of the acrylamide gel mo-
bility of the two fragments used in simulations. As ex-
pected, the A-tract repeat exhibits a reduced rate of mi-
gration. The diﬀerence is quite signiﬁcant so that the
two molecules are well resolved both in separate lanes
and when mixed in the same sample. Small variations
in rates of migration could be caused by many factors,
like the number of tightly bound water molecules, for
instance. Their role was reduced to the possible min-
imum here owing to the identical base pair content in
the two sequences. The eﬀect observed in our gel migra-
tion experiments, therefore, can be entirely attributed to
the static curvature in the A-tract fragment, in excellent
agreement with calculations.

Discussion

The results described in sections above strongly evi-
dence that our calculations really model the experimen-

9

tal A-tract induced bending. The curvature is caused by
the sequence because it is the only asymmetrical feature
involved in the two initial states, whereas the trajecto-
ries converge to the same bend regardless of the starting
point. The minor groove in the A-tract repeat acquires a
well-known characteristic shape with narrowings towards
the 3’-ends of A-tracts. The curvature is evidently static
and its magnitude and direction agree with experimen-
tal estimates. The junction zones between the A-tracts
are bent stronger than the rest of the molecule. Despite
its curvature the DNA molecule has average helical pa-
rameters close to the standard B-form values. Finally,
the gel migration assay conﬁrms that the A-tract repeat
constructed to increase the curvature in silico is strongly
bent in vitro as well. All these results suggest that we
managed to reproduce the intrinsic DNA bending at least
for some sequences, which allows one to analyze its mech-
anism and compare it with earlier views and hypotheses.
The goal of the theories of intrinsic curvature is to
clarify the balance of interactions that determine the
DNA structure, and their consequences go far beyond
the problem of A-tracts. The list of available interac-
tions is well-known, but the question is which of them
is the driving force because it appears diﬃcult to distin-
guish the cause and the consequence. Everybody agrees,
for instance, that the strong phosphate repulsion favors
straight rigid rod structure and that local charge neu-
tralization, for example by solvent counterions, can cause
bending35,36,37. In a bent double helix, base pair orien-
tations must deviate from those in the canonical B-DNA
at least in some base pair steps, and the grooves must be
narrowed at the inside edge of the bend. The same situ-
ation can be viewed from another corner, however. It is
equally well understood that non-ideal stacking may be
energetically favorable in some sequences and that many
such fragments can bend the whole structure.38 As in the
ﬁrst case, the grooves must be narrowed, with phosphate
groups approaching one another, which creates regions
of low potential that should be populated by counterions
if they are available. Such theories, however, encounter
problems when applied systematically to the whole body
of available experimental data,8 and our results qualita-
tively disagree with them as well.

According to any mechanism that starts from the base
pair stacking, like the wedge38 and the junction39 mod-
els of DNA bending, a curved DNA must be built out
of asymmetric blocks, with their structures determined
by base pair sequence. The bending, therefore, must be
accompanied by repetition of local structures in iden-
tical sequence fragments. This fundamental theoreti-
cal prediction fails for the static bends observed in MD
simulations15. The structures of sequence repeats in the
bent state are microscopically heterogeneous and conver-
gence to speciﬁc local conformations is not necessary for
bending. The same pattern is found in calculations pre-
sented here; At-A and At-B arrived at a bent state with
deﬁnite direction and angle, but local helical parameters
and backbone conformations did not converge (see Ap-

pendix), and the minor groove proﬁles in Fig. 6 are only
similar, not identical.

The stacking theories were critically compared with
experiments during many years, and their weak points
are generally recognized. In the recent years the alterna-
tive model attracted much attention, namely, hypothet-
ical electrostatic deformation caused by speciﬁc binding
of solvent cations and neutralization of phosphates in
the minor grooves of A-tracts.40 In our calculations all
counterion eﬀects are considered non-speciﬁc, therefore,
our results demonstrate that static bending is physically
possible without breaking the charge symmetry around
DNA. Taking into account the well known experimental
counter arguments,41 one should conclude that solvent
counterions are hardly responsible for the intrinsic cur-
vature in DNA. At the same time, as noted above, the
electrostatic ﬁeld around a curved double helix is likely to
have solvent accessible sites of low potential. When oc-
cupied by counterions, these sites can provide additional
stabilization and facilitate bending. This old view of the
role of counterions26 actually agrees with all available ex-
perimental data and does not contradict simulation re-
sults.

The role of counterions in DNA bending is a subject of
ongoing debate in the literature42,41. The important role
of the ionic environment for the structure of nucleic acids
is generally recognized, however, until recently counteri-
ons were not considered as a possible cause of curvature
in free DNA. The A-tract induced bending can occur
without divalent counterions and it is normally maxi-
mal with the lowest concentrations of monovalent ones.
When a few years ago it was suggested that monovalent
counterions speciﬁcally bound in the minor grooves of A-
tracts can be responsible for intrinsic bends it did not re-
sult from re-evaluation of old data or some radically new
ﬁndings.
It was mainly caused by understanding that
earlier theories faced serious diﬃculties and also by the
advent of new experimental and computational methods
that allowed one to scrutinize the distribution of solvent
ions bound to DNA. Recent experimental and simulation
studies conﬁrm that that the sites of preferred binding
really exist. As noted above, however, the electrostatic
ﬁeld around curved DNA should be non-uniform, and
the structure-speciﬁc binding of counterions is to be ex-
pected whatever the origin of the curvature is. There-
fore, the counterion theory of bending cannot be based
upon such observations and should be ﬁrst of all com-
pared with other available data. Discussions in the lit-
erature are usually concentrated upon controversial re-
sults where the counterion hypothesis can help to resolve
contradictions. Original experiments successfully inter-
preted by the stacking mechanisms are tacitly assumed
to agree with the counterion model as well, which is not
at all obvious. Below we give one such example.

The stacking theories predict that the bend induced
by a single A-tract is characterized by a constant value
regardless of its length, which agrees well with experi-
mental data. For the counterion mechanism this is not

10

so. The solvent cations are assumed to zero phosphate
charges at one side of the double helix. The bending is
caused by the electrostatic tension at the opposite neg-
atively charged side, therefore it must depend upon the
number of repulsing centers and distances between them.
Consider sequence repeat (A6N4)n, where A6 and N4
stand for 6 bp A-tract and a 4 bp non-A-tract sequences,
respectively. According to the electrostatic model its
curvature is due to repulsion between phosphate groups
of N4 separated by one helical turn. Now consider re-
peat (A17N4)n. The N4 phosphates are separated by two
helical turns, consequently, the repulsion between them
is four times weaker and the partial curvature must be
smaller. Haran and Crothers examined the curvature in
sequence repeats (TA5N4)n and (A16N5)n. According to
their data the curvature in both series changes according
to the number of A-tracts; for instance, the bend an-
gle is similar in (TA5N4)5 and (A16N5)5. This cannot
be rationalized with the counterion theory and, in fact,
this mechanism has an inherent diﬃculty with all data on
the curvature induced by A-tracts longer than one helical
turn.

The compressed backbone theory outlined in the In-
troduction oﬀers a single simple idea that gives a con-
sistent interpretation to many long-standing controver-
sies concerning the DNA structure. This theory predicts
that, with any base pair sequence, the backbone stiﬀ-
ness causes smooth modulations of DNA grooves, which
breaks its helical symmetry and creates regions of in-
trinsic curvature, usually in the widenings of the minor
groove. With a random base pair sequence, these regions
are not properly aligned and, moreover, they can drift
with time along the double helix. That is why the generic
DNA is straight on average although it is always curved
locally. In A-tract repeats, as well as in other sequences
where base pair properties alternate in phase with the
helical screw,43 the phases of backbone oscillations are
ﬁxed and the local curvature sums up to give macroscopic
static bends. The foregoing scenario agrees with many
experimental facts, notably, with the general features of
the ensemble of B-DNA conformations determined by X-
ray crystallography and eﬀects of environment upon the
intrinsic curvature15. The microheterogeneity of the bent
DNA state revealed in MD is readily accounted for be-
cause according to this theory the curved DNA should
be considered as an “idioform” characterized by certain
topological attributes, like the bending direction and the
distribution of main maxima and minima in the minor
groove proﬁle, rather than a structure with deﬁnite atom
positions. The overall backbone length does not deter-
mine its conformation exactly, and, moreover, a partic-
ular waving backbone proﬁle may be compatible with
multiple alternative orientations of base pairs.

The competition between stacking and the backbone
compression is characteristic of physical systems called
frustrated.44 Certainly, almost any complex system in-
volves competing interactions, however, in some cases
this leads to speciﬁc distinctions. A typical textbook

example is given by three anti-ferromagnetic spins in a
triangle conﬁguration. Any pair of them prefers anti-
parallel orientation, but it is not possible to give the low-
est energy to all three pairs simultaneously. The mini-
mum energy state is degenerate and one spin can always
be ﬂipped so that the total energy is conserved. Now con-
sider a circular DNA molecule with a homopolymer base
pair sequence. The compressed backbone will impose
groove modulations, but there are no preferred regions
for narrowings and widenings and the ground state ap-
pears strongly degenerate. The similarity between these
two examples is evident. One usual physical consequence
of frustration is very important for biology, namely, the
possibility of a glassy state. In this state the characteris-
tic times of microscopic transitions become macroscopic.
Transitions between wavy backbone conﬁgurations in a
long DNA can be very slow because many groove nar-
rowings and widenings must be moved concertedly. This
may explain the recently detected supra-microsecond re-
laxation times in bending dynamics of relatively short
DNA fragments.24

The compressed backbone theory does not permit con-
struction of simple rules for a priori calculation of curva-
ture in any given sequence. Nevertheless, it oﬀers some
predictions that can be checked in experiments. It sug-
gests, for example, that the local curvature can be relaxed
by introducing single-strand breaks. Another eﬀect that
can be checked consists in modulation of the intrinsic
curvature in circular plasmids with positive and negative
superhelical density. In a plasmid with weak positive su-
perhelical density the backbone is stretched and, if there
is an internal A-tract repeat, its curvature should be re-
duced. For a negative density an opposite trend should
be expected. Actually, these sorts of experiments have
been reported long ago by Diekmann and Wang.45 They
found that the structure of A-tract repeats inserted in
circular plasmids changes systematically with the link-
ing number, in striking contrast with random sequence
fragments. None of the earlier theories of DNA bending
can rationalize these data while the compressed backbone
hypothesis readily explains them, and it can be checked
more thoroughly by using the same experimental idea.

Materials and Methods

Calculations

Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed
by the internal coordinate method (ICMD)46,47 includ-
ing special technique for ﬂexible sugar rings22, with
AMBER9448,49 force ﬁeld and TIP3P water.50 All cal-
culations were carried out without cut-oﬀs and bound-
ary conditions. The time step was 10 fsec. The so-called
minimal model of B-DNA was used20,21. It includes only
a partial hydration shell and treats counterion and long
range solvation eﬀects implicitly. The starting ﬁber A-

11

and B-DNA models were constructed from the published
atom coordinates.19 The hydration protocols were same
as before,15 with the identical number of explicit water
molecules in A- and B-DNA starts. Programs XmMol51
and Mathematica by Wolfram Research Inc. were em-
ployed for graphics and data analysis.

Oligonucleotides and construction of 5’-labeled DNA probes

The sequences of the 35 nt-long synthetic oligonu-
cleotides used here are shown in Fig. 1a. The dou-
ble stranded DNAs were obtained by annealing of the
two complementary oligonucleotides, one of them la-
beled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [32-P]-ATP. The
annealing was carried out by incubating the oligonu-
cleotides (300 nM) for 3 min at 80◦C in 20 mM Tris-
HCl (pH 8.0), 400 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA and then
allowing them to cool slowly.

Gel mobility assay

Mobility of the DNA fragments was analyzed in 16%
gels (acrylamide to bis-acrylamide, 29:1) buﬀered with 90
mM Tris-borate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.6. Gels were pre-run
under constant power until stabilization of current. End-
labeled DNA in a buﬀer containing 20 mM Tris-HCL, 50
mM NaCL, 7% glycerol, pH 8.0 and bromophenol-blue
was loaded onto the gel. The electrophoresis was per-
formed under constant power and constant temperature
of 8◦C. The dried gels were exposed to storage phos-
phor screens and visualized on a 400S PhosphorImager
(Molecular Dynamics).

APPENDIX

Bending Dynamics and Microheterogeneity of The
Bent State

The snapshot in Fig. A1 corresponds to one of the
bending maxima distinguished in the traces in Fig. 2. In
this stricture, the three zones between A-tracts clearly
make a major contribution to the overall bend. Smoothly
bent conformations with similar parameters were also
observed, but we did not encounter examples of strong
bending with A-tracts curved and the junction zones
straight. Figures A3 and A2 demonstrate that conver-
gence of the bending dynamics does not require unique
speciﬁc local conformations, i. e. that the bent state is
microheterogeneous.

FIG. A3. (a) Dynamics of BI and BII backbone conformers in At-A and At-B. The BI and BII conformations are distinguished
by the values of two consecutive backbone torsions, ε and ζ. In a transition, they change concertedly from (t,g
,t).
The diﬀerence ζ − ε is, therefore, positive in BI state and negative in BII, and it is used as a monitoring indicator, with
the corresponding gray scale levels shown on the right. Each base pair step is characterized by a column consisting of two
sub-columns, with the left sub-columns referring to the sequence written at the top in 5’-3’ direction from left to right. The
right sub-columns refer to the complementary sequence shown at the bottom. (b) Comparison of the ﬁnal distributions of
BI and BII backbone conformers in At-A and At-B shown in the same way as in plate (a).

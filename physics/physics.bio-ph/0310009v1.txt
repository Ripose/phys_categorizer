to solutions of nonlinear kinetic equations used in phenomenological description of biochemical
oscillations.

INTRODUCTION

Perhaps the greatest achievement of a pre-quantum
phenomenology in chemistry was the Mendeleev periodic
table of elements. The table, in particular, allowed to
predict new elements with correctly anticipated proper-
ties. But to really understand the structure of the table
one had to invent a simply-looking equation

adjoint operator.

The Schr¨odinger equation (1) with appropriately cho-
sen H allowed to understand the origin and types of
chemical bonds, that is, the deep structures behind the
Mendeleev table. Although the identiﬁcation of H for
a concrete molecule was of crucial importance, there
were certain features of the abstract equation that al-
lowed to determine general properties of those systems
whose dynamics could be governed by (1). For exam-
ple, a self-adjoint H was related to conservative and iso-
lated sytems. The conserved quantity is the average
energy E =
. Conservative systems that are

non-isolated (i.e. non-trivially interact with the outside
world) were described by another simply-looking equa-
tion

Thinking of the present-day chemistry or biochemistry
one is struck by the ubiquity of nonlinear kinetic equa-
tions [1, 2]. Physically, all kinetic equations describe
dynamics of probabilities and in this sense are close to
(2). Typical kinetic equations describe open systems
and the associated probabilities are related with com-
muting propositions. Nonlinearity occurs whenever there

are feedbacks or cooperative phenomena, and details of
evolution depend on the number of substrates and phe-
nomenology used to model right-hand-sides of the equa-
tions.

Similarly to the catastrophe theory, phenomenological
modelling is to some extent an art [3]. Having experi-
ence with nonlinear evolutions one is capable of choosing
the right-hand-sides of the equations in such a way that
certain qualitative elements of the dynamics will have to
occur, and then it remains to play with parameters. Not
trying to diminish the role of phenomenological modelling
we have to admit that phenomenology is a two-edged
sword. On the one hand, it links qualitative analysis
with quantitative predictions, and often reveals aspects
that are initially unexpected. On the other hand, how-
ever, shapes of the equations are dictated by our needs.
This should be contrasted with (1) and (2) which can be
derived from ﬁrst principles.

A general property of systems described by (1) or (2) is
the exact linearity of the evolutions they generate. Lin-
ear evolutions practically do not occur in biological and
chemical systems, so linearity is in this context a draw-
back. Sometimes a linear approximation is justifed if
some paramters are small, but the generic case is nonlin-
ear. In Ref. [4] we have argued that a candidate equation
describing a conservative quantum system in a feedback
with some environment is the nonlinear generalization of
the von Neumann equation

i ˙ρ = [H, f (ρ)]

(3)

where f (ρ) is an operator function satisfying the “no-
feedback, no-nonlinearity” property, formally meaning
ψ
that f (ρ) = ρ if ρ is a projector on some direction
i
|
in a Hilbert space. Eq. (3) is integrable in the sense
of soliton theory for any f . The time-invariant is now
E = Tr
. A soliton technique of solving (3),
Hf (ρ)
based on Darboux transformations, was introduced in
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
[5], further developed in [6], and recently generalized in
[7]. Therefore, as opposed to the kinetic equations that
typically have to be solved numerically (for exceptions
cf. [8, 9, 10]), we can work with exact analytic solutions.
This allows us to have access to the time scales and pre-
cision numerically unavailable.

The set of solutions of (3) contains all the solutions
satisﬁes (1). A new class

of “self-switching” solutions occuring only for nonlinear
f was discovered in [5] and applied in [4] in the context
of morphogenesis. These solutions are characterized by
three regimes involving a single switching between two
asymptotically linear evolutions.

Still, looking for the most striking manifestations of
biochemical nonlinear evolutions one arrives at phenom-
ena that are rhythmic. Periodic switching, with periods
ranging from fraction of a second to years, is encountered
at all levels of biological organization, and its successful
modelling in terms of nonlinear kinetic equations is one
of the great achievements of computational biology (for
a review cf. [11]).

The kinetic equations considered in phenomenological
models of biochemical oscillations involve nonlinearities
of a mixed linear-Hill type. The dynamical systems are
typically ﬁnite dimensional, the number of degrees of
freedom corresponding to the number of diﬀerent sub-
strates one takes into account. The use of Hill func-
tions of the form χy,n(x) = xn/(yn + xn) is motivated by
phenomenological arguments and their ability to contin-
uously interpolate between 0 and 1. The latter feature
allows for a dynamical mechanism of switching, a prop-
erty whose origin can be traced back to bifurcations of
nonlinear maps and catastrophe theory.

Of particular interest are theoretical studies of circa-
rhythms. Let us recall that circa-rhythms are “classes
of rhythms that are capable of free-running in constant
conditions with a period approximating that of the en-
vironmental cycle to which they are normally synchro-
nized” [12]. The examples of the rhythms are the cir-
cadian (24 hours), the circalunar (28 hours), or the cir-
cannual (365.25 days) ones. What makes circa-rhythms
interesting from a formal point of view is the interplay
between the phases where there exists an external forcing
(light–darkness periods, say), and the rhythmicity that
sustains even after the external driving is switched oﬀ (as
in experiments in constant darkness). Formally, the two
cases may correspond to nonlinearities involving (or not)
an explicit time dependence of some parameters.

To give an example, the model of circadian rhythms in
Neurospora [13] involves four variables and two types of
Hill functions. The rhythmicity occurs in the model even
without an external driving, but the case with explicit
time dependence of coeﬃcients is treated as well. Similar
constructions are given in [14, 15].

In the present paper we address the problem of circa-
rhythmicity from the perspective of Eq. (3). The main
idea is to consider a composite Hamiltonian system that,
as a whole, is conservative. There are two sets of degrees
of freedom corresponding to its two subsystems. When
we look at certain averages associated with one of the
subsystems we ﬁnd that their time evolution can be de-
termined by an eﬀective density matrix whose dynamics
is given again by an equation of the form (3), but now
with explicitly time-dependent coeﬃcients in the nonlin-
ear function f (ρ). Therefore, the interaction between
the two subsystems eﬀectively turns one of them into a

2

pacemaker that drives the other subsystem and generates
its evolution with characteristic bursting patterns exibit-
ing “day” and “night” phases. As opposed to the phe-
nomenological models found in the literature we do not
“force” switching by putting Hill functions by hand. We
take a simple quadratic nonlinearity satisfying the “no
feedback, no nonlinearity” condition. The motivation for
this concrete choice comes from its simplicity and expe-
rience showing that the nonlinear behavior found here is
generic and analogous to the one found for more com-
plicated f ’s (cf. the example of f (ρ) = ρq
1 with
arbitrary real q analyzed in [6]). The solutions we obtain
are also interesting in themseleves as ﬁrst examples of
solutions of (3) exhibiting more than one self-swiching.

The paper is organized as follows. We begin with an
example of a nonlinear von Neumann equation (3) for
a composite system and time independent nonlinearity.
We then ﬁnd its particular solution that is reducible to
a new von Neumann equation for a subsystem but with
explicitly time-dependent nonlinearity. We then general-
ize the example to the class of time-dependent von Neu-
mann equations and show how to construct their solu-
tions. Next we explicitly solve an example and illustrate
its rhythmic properties.

III. QUANTUM PACEMAKER AND
FEEDBACK

The pacemaker is an oscillatory system whose state can
be modiﬁed by an external entraining agent, a zeitgeber
[12]. Our main interest in this paper is in the free-running
oscillation of the pacemaker x(t) and the circa-rhythms
it induces in the absence of the zeitgeber.

3

The next level is the coupling between the pacemaker,
which deﬁnes the clock “mechanism”, and the observable-
level circa-rhythms which deﬁne the “hands” of the clock.
We assume a nonlinear feedback between the hands and
the mechanism, but the dynamics is nondissipative in the
sense that the energy of the hands averaged over a single
cycle of the oscillation is constant.

Motivated by the analysis of the previous section we

concentrate on the following class of equations

i ˙w(t) = f1(t)[H, w(t)] + f2(t)[H, f

(21)

]

w(t)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

which deﬁne the state of the hands of the clock. The
“no-feedback, no-nonlinearity” condition reads w(t) =
whenever w(t)2 = w(t). Now
f1(t)w(t) + f2(t)f
w(t)
assume we know a solution w0(t) of (3). Then

is a solution of (21) as can be veriﬁed by a direct cal-
culation. The whole problem of solving (21) reduces to
ﬁnding a solution of (3), which can be performed by soli-
ton techniques [5, 6].

Let us consider a simple but generic example where

f (w) = (1

s)w + sw2 and

−

(17)

f1(t) = 1 + ǫ cos ωt,

f2(t) =

ǫ cos ωt

(23)

−

The parameter s allows us to compare situations where
the driven dynamics is linear (s = 0) and purely nonlin-
ear (s = 1), and for the two cases investigate the role of
the ǫs. Varying s we can also investigate stability prop-
erties of the rhythms under ﬂuctuations of the feedback.

IV. HANDS OF THE CLOCK

P

∞n=0 n

The hands of the clock are described by the Hamil-
of a harmonic oscil-
n
tonian H = a†a =
|
lator type. The frequency of the oscillator is equal to
unity, meaning that this is a reference frequency for all
the other frequencies found in the system. Modelling the
hands by a harmonic oscillator is quite natural for ob-
vious reasons. The quantum oscillator has in addition
the appealing property of being delocalized. The oscilla-
tions occur at the level of probabilities in position space
and what we call “hands” is a kind of a center-of-mass
quantity. This type of oscillation is what one expects
in a biological system, since classical oscillators such as
pendula or springs are too “mechanical” to be of any rel-
evance. Intuitively, in our model, the hands move at time
t to the region of space where the concentration of prob-
ability is the biggest. The probability density may be
regarded as a measure of state of a certain spatially ex-
tended object. In the absence of a feedback between the
hands and the pacemaker, the hands oscillate harmoni-
cally with their own internal frequency. We shall see later
that the nonlinear coupling may practically suppress the
internal oscillations of the hands in certain intervals of

i ˙wk = [Hk, f (wk)] = [H0, f (wk)].

(25)

15+√5

time. What will remain are the sudden bursts occuring,
roughly, with the period of the pacemaker.

Quantum harmonic oscillator is an inﬁnite dimensional
dynamical system and, hence, a solution of von Neu-
mann equations may be characterized by an arbitrary
number of parameters determining the initial state of the
hands. There exists a simple trick allowing to construct
inﬁnitely-dimensional solutions on the basis of a single
ﬁnite-dimensional one. The trick exploits equal spacing
of eigenvalues of H. With our choice of units the eigenval-
ues are given simply by natural numbers. Let us divide
,
them into sets containing N elements:
}
, and so on. Each such sub-
{
}
set corresponds to a block in the Hamiltonian, and each
block can be represented by a N
N diagonal matrix of
the form

N, N + 1, . . . , N + N

0, 1, . . . , N

−

−

×

{

1

Hk = k1 + diag(0, 1, . . . , N

1) = k1 + H0.

(24)

−

As a consequence, in each block we have to solve the
same matrix equation since a restriction wk of w to the
k-th subspace satisﬁes

The job can be reduced to ﬁnding a suﬃciently general
solution of a N
N problem. In each subspace we can
take a diﬀerent initial condition and a diﬀerent normal-
ization of trace. The whole inﬁnite-dimensional solution
will take the form of a direct sum

×

w(t) =

∞k=0pkwk(t, pk),

⊕

(26)

∞k=0 pk = 1. The k-th part depends on pk in a compli-
cated way since the function f (w) is not 1-homogeneous,
P
i.e. f (λw)
= λf (w). The inhomogeneity implies that
change of normalization simultaneously rescales time; the
normalization of probability implies that a change of pk
in a k-th subspace inﬂuences all the other subspaces by
making their dynamics faster or slower. In this sense the
solution, in spite of its simplicity, is not a simple direct
sum of independent evolutions.

In order to illustrate the possible eﬀects we can use the
solutions derived in [4] for the simplest nontrivial case
involving self-switching, i.e.
for N = 3 and quadratic
nonlinearity. Of course, since N = 3, the Hamiltonian
H and the solution w possess matrix elements describing
transitions 1
3, between three diﬀerent
↔
basis vectors. Although the observation is in itself trivial,
we want to stress here the formal analogy to the so-called
three-variable models of bursting oscillations in enzyme
reactions with autocatalytic regulation [16, 17].

If one does not integrate over the pacemaker period,
one ﬁnds that the internal energy of the hands harmon-
ically oscillates with the pacemaker frequency ω. What
is characteristic, however, the hands do not oscillate har-
monically but behave as if they were accumulating energy
during the phases of quiescence in order to suddenly re-
lease it in violent bursts. Moreover, the bursts are diﬀer-
ent during the two halves of the pacemeaker cycle, and
thus resemble the day-night diﬀerences one ﬁnds in real
organisms.

amples. We plot the dynamics of the hands ¯q(t) =

timing system whose role is to coordinate various com-
plicated and diﬀerent in shape rhythms of a biological
system.

Splitting of a “clock” into a “pacemaker” and “hands”
occurs in our example quite naturally. The entire “clock”
is a conservative system so the rhythmic behavior we ﬁnd
is of endogenous origin. However, the system cannot be
treated as isolated from external environment since the
solution ρ = P
w is not a projector and, hence, involves
nontrivial external correlations (cf. the analysis of this
point given in [4]).

⊗

To make our analysis simple we have played with a
concrete family of exact solutions of (3). The family is
characterized by several parameters related to the choice
of the equation (ω, s) and the initial condition for the dy-
ǫ, α). The solutions we have derived re-
namics (x0 =
veal an unknown aspect of nonlinear von Neumann equa-
tions — the possibilty of evolution involving an inﬁnite
number of switching events.

In spite of its simplicity, the quadratic nonlinearity
generates circa-rhythmic behavior of surprising complex-
ity and variety. Much more complicated types of behav-
ior would have been found if one had used the freedom
of higher dimensionality oﬀered by (26). Moreover, the
solution of the factorized form P
w, with P a projec-
tor, is very special and occurs only in cases the operators
X(t) and X(t′) commute for all t, t′. Had we replaced
the Abelian group of rotations in a plane (with generator
J) by something more complicated, we would not have
been able to use the Ansatz with factorization.

⊗

To end these remarks let us make it clear that we do
not claim to have found a better description of nonlin-
ear oscillations occuring in biochemical systems than the
phenomenological approach of Goldbeter and his Brus-
sels school. What we do claim, however, is that nonlinear
von Neumann equations of the form (3), in addition to
their appealing general properties, imply a vast range of
phenomena with analogies in biophysical systems. One
should not be surprised if (3) will one day play a funda-
mental role in life sciences.

The ability of plants and mammals to measure approx-
imately 24-hour intervals of time is no doubt of an en-
dogenous origin. Our current understanding of circadian
rhythms leads to a notion of a pacemaker, an oscillating

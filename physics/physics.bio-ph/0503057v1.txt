Chirality Selection in Open Flow Systems and in Polymerization

Yukio Saito ∗ and Hiroyuki Hyuga †

(Received December 19, 2013)

As an attempt to understand the homochirality of organic molecules in life, a chemical
reaction model is proposed where the production of chiral monomers from achiral substrate is
catalyzed by the polymers of the same enatiomeric type. This system has to be open because
in a closed system the enhanced production of chiral monomers by enzymes is compensated
by the associated enhancement in back reaction, and the chiral symmetry is conserved. Open
ﬂow without cross inhibition is shown to lead to the chirality selection in a general model.
In polymerization, the inﬂux of substrate from the ambience and the eﬄux of chiral products
for purposes other than the catalyst production make the system necessarily open. The chiral
symmetry is found to be broken if the inﬂux of substrate lies within a ﬁnite interval. As the
eﬃciency of the enzyme increases, the maximum value of the enantiomeric excess approaches
unity so that the chirality selection becomes complete.

Introduction

Between two possible stereostructures of organic
molecules, i.e. a right-handed (D) and a mirror-image
left-handed (L) form, life on earth has chosen only one
type: L-amino acids and D-sugars.1 Various mechanisms
for the origin of this chiral asymmetry, so called homochi-
rality, have been proposed,1 but the predicted asymme-
try turned out to be very minute, and therefore, it has
to be ampliﬁed to explain the homochirality.

Frank showed theoretically that an autocatalytic pro-
duction of chiral molecules with an antagonistic process
ampliﬁes enantiomeric excess (ee) and brings about the
homochirality.2 His theory has had no experimental sup-
port for a long time. Recently, an example of ee ampli-
ﬁcation has been found in the production of pyrimidyl
alkanol,3 and the temporal evolution was explained by
the second-order autocatalytic reaction.4 In our previous
papers,5–8 we have reported that, in addition to the non-
linear autotacalysis, recycling of achiral substrates by the
decomposition of chiral products accomplishes complete
homochirality in a closed system without any antagonis-
tic processes.

The chemical reaction model we proposed5 involves
production of a chiral molecule C from achiral molecules
A and B. With an assumption that there is an ample
amount of the material B, the reaction is governed solely
by the concentration a of the substrate A. We adopt the
convention of R, S representation to denote two enan-
tiomers of the chiral product C as (R)-C and (S)-C,
which are further abbreviated as R and S, respectively,
for brevity. The reaction is assumed to include a nonlin-
ear autocatalytic eﬀect as well as a recycling back reac-
tion, and the concentrations r and s of chiral species R
and S develop by the following rate equations;

˙r = (k0 + k1r + k2r2)a

where ˙x represents the time derivative ˙x = dx/dt. The
reaction system is assumed to be closed so that the con-
centration a of the substrate A is determined by the
s. Here, the constant c0
r
conservation as a = c0
is ﬁxed at the initial time as c0 = a0 + r0 + s0. Reac-
tion coeﬃcients k0, k1 and k2 correspond to those in the
production processes without autocatalysis, with a lin-
ear and a quadratic autocatalysis, respectively. λ0 is a
rate coeﬃcient of decomposition process from the prod-
uct R or S to the substrate A. The major conclusion we
have drawn out from the model eq.(1.1) is that, only in
the case with a quadratic autocatalysis and decomposi-
tion process (k2, λ > 0), the chiral symmetry breaking
is possible.5

However, the relevance of pyrimidyl alkanol to life is
suggestive at best, and the problem of the homochirality
in life is still not yet resolved. One way to address this
problem is to construct a model that incoporates some
characteristic features of organic molecules in life. For
instance, amino acids have the potential to polymerize
into chain molecules, as peptides and proteins. They act
as catalysts or enzymes to produce various molecules,
and among them may be amino acids themselves, al-
though this expectation has not so far been conﬁrmed
experimentally. Based upon this hypothesis, Sandars9
proposed a ”toy model” for the generation of homochi-
rality such that polymers catalyze production process of
chiral monomers from achiral substrates. He included
cross inhibition eﬀect such that the addition of wrong
handed enantiomer to the polymer halts further polymer-
ization.9, 10 The cross inhibition is similar to the mutual
destruction eﬀect introduced by Frank. In this paper, we
would like to propose an alternative model for the gener-
ation of homochirality, exploiting a chracteristic feature
that reactions take place in an open system; we do not
require processes of cross inhibition.

Most of amino acids (19 out of 20 species ) are chiral,

but they are composed of achiral molecules as carbon
dioxides, anmonium, water and so on. These achiral sub-
strates are supplied from and leave away to the ambience.
On the other hand, the products, amino acids, polymer-
ize to form peptides and proteins, which not only func-
tion as catalysts or enzymes but also are used for many
other purposes as body construction, metabolism, etc.
This means that some amino acids leak away from the re-
action path of catalysts production: The chiral products
thus ﬂow out from the reaction system in concern. All
these features lead us to the necessity to study an open
system. We construct a minimal reaction model includ-
ing the above ingredients. In a certain limit, we can show
that open reaction systems are reducible to our previous
model eq.(1.1) or similar models in a closed system.5

In the following section

2, a simple model of chiral
§
molecule production under an open ﬂow is shown to be-
have similar to that in a closed system after a transient
3, the polymerization model is studied, and the
time. In
open ﬂow is found necessary to break the chiral symme-
try for this model. The results are summarized in the last
section

2. Chemical Reaction in an Open System under

Flow

First we extend our nonlinear autocatalytic system
proposed previously5 to an open system under ﬂow, and
show that a ﬂow plays essentially the same role as the
recycling process in a closed system.

As for the origins of the incoming ﬂow, substrate
molecules A may be produced by some chemical reac-
tions inside the system, or there may be a supply of A’s
by a ﬂow from ambience. In any case, the incoming ﬂux
of A is assumed to be constant and is denoted as F . On
the other hand, dissipation may be due to the outgoing
ﬂow which takes away part of all the chemical species
from the region where the reactions are taking place.
For simplicity the rate of outﬂow is assumed common
to all chemical species, and denoted as µ0. Combining
the eﬀects of autocatalytic chemical reaction and in- and
out-ﬂows, the rate equations are written as

˙r = f (r)a

˙s = f (s)a

(2.1)

Here f (r) = k0 + k1r + k2r2 is the production rate of
R including the eﬀect of autocatalysis, f (s) is the corre-
sponding one for S, λ0 is the rate of back reaction from
chiral products R or S to the substrate A. It is then
easy to show that the sum of all the species relax to a
constant value c0 = F/µ0 in a relaxation time µ−1
as
0
r + s + a = c0 + (r0 + s0 + a0
µ0t). Thus, af-
−
ter the relaxation time µ−1
0 , the open system we consider
reduces eﬀectively to a closed system (1.1) at a ﬁxed to-
tal concentration c0 with a modiﬁed back reaction rate
λ = λ0 + µ0. The diﬀerence between the two systems is
essentially the value of c0; in a closed system it is deter-
mined as an initial condition, whereas in an open system

c0) exp(

−

it is controlled by the in- and out-going ﬂows. There-
fore, even in the case that the back reaction is absent
(λ0 = 0), the outﬂow plays essentially the same role as
the back reaction, and the chirality selection can be re-
alized in combination with nonlinear autocatalysis. This
conclusion leads us to propose an experiment of the Soai
reaction3 under the ﬂow with an expectation that the
complete homochirality can be realized.

The analysis in this section reveals that the generic
form of the model (1.1) has a wide range of applicability
to describe the chirality selection in various systems. In
the following section in the analysis of polymerization
processes, we encounter a generalized form of this type
of rate equations

˙r = f (r)a

˙s = f (s)a

where f (r) is an eﬀective production rate and λ(r) is an
eﬀective rate of back reaction. The substrate concentra-
tion a follows another generic equation. Equation (2.2)
does not contain the cross inhibition term such as
λcrs .
By suitable conditions for the functions f (r), λ(r) and
other parameters, the chirality selection is realized as is
demonstrated in the following. Some of the details is de-
scribed in the Appendix.

3. Chirality Selection in Polymerization

We now study the chiral symmetry breaking in the cat-
alyst polymerization processes. Our model starts from
chemical reactions of chiral molecule production from
achiral substrate, as

A

k0⇋
λ0

R,

A

k0⇋
λ0

S.

(3.1)

Here an achiral substrate A reacts to produce chiral
species R and S with a rate k0 and the reverse reaction
takes place with a rate λ0. R and S symbolize two enan-
tiomeric forms of amino acids in L and D forms. We call
them R and S chiral monomers respectively hereafter.
Since the production of amino acids requires energy, the
rate k0 is very small. Only in some special environment
and places, for instance under thunderstorms or close
to seaﬂoor hydrothermal vent, the energy is supplied to
increase k0. But if there is only the enhancement of ran-
dom production by k0, then the racemic mixture of R
and S monomers results, as is shown in the following.
Thus, for chirality selection, we have to consider further
mechanism.

Chiral monomers are assumed to polymerize if they

are of the same enatiomeric type as
ki⇋
λi

R + Ri

Ri+1,

S + Si

ki⇋
λi

Si+1,

(3.2)

· · ·

. Here ki and λi represent respectively
with i = 1, 2,
the polymerization and decomposition rate of the chi-
ral polymers Ri+1 or Si+1. Generally, polymers at higher
levels or macromolecules have some chemical functions.
When the N -mers, RN and SN , act as enzymes to re-
produce the monomer of the same enatiomeric type, the
catalytic process is described as

A + RN

R + RN ,

A + SN

S + SN .

Here ke represents the rate of catalytic production and
λe that of back reaction. A good enzyme should have a
large production rate ke compared to k0, that of the non-
autocatalytic production process. However, the ratio of
rate coeﬃcients of a forward and a backward reactions
is speciﬁed by the energy diﬀerence of initial and ﬁnal
states, A and R (or S). Then the back reaction with λe
should also be enhanced so as to satisfy the following
relation

While the whole system is described by the reaction
processes (3.1-3.3) for a closed system, there are other
processes for an open system; that is the exchange of
substrate molecules between the system and the envi-
ronment E as is illistrated as

In the present paper, we consider the simplest case
such that the dimer is suﬃcient to present catalytic ef-
fect, and assume N = 2. Then, the concentrations of
achiral substrate a and of chiral products up to the
dimers r, r2, s, s2 evolve respectively as

Let us ﬁrst consider a closed sytem with F = µi =

Even with this conservation law, rate equations are still
too complicated to study the chirality selection analyt-
ically, since there are many variables coupled nonlin-
early. Therefore, we utilize a steady-state approximation8
such that the dimerization proceeds promptly and one
may set ˙r2 = ˙s2 = 0. Then the steady-state concentra-
tions of dimers are determined in terms of monomers as

r2 = (k1/λ1)r2 and s2 = (k1/λ1)s2, and the rate equa-
tions for the monomers reduce to

with a = c0
2(r2 +s2). Here the relation eq.(3.4)
is used. Dimer enzymes lead to nonlinear autocatalytic
eﬀect, but the eﬀect is compensated by the same amount
of enhanced back reaction. Since k0 + (kek1/λ1)r2 and
k0 + (kek1/λ1)s2 are always positive, the sole possible
ﬁxed point is racemic: ¯r = ¯s = (k0/λ0)¯a. Only in the
absence of the back reaction, λ0 = λe = 0, the system
has a ﬁxed line a = 0. There is no chirality selection if
the system has a ﬁxed line, as was pointed out in the
previous studies of a closed system.5, 6

From the above analysis, it is concluded that the poly-
merization system (our model at least) has to be open
for the chiral symmetry breaking to occur. To analyse the
open system theoretically, we again use the steady-state
approximation by replacing the dimer concentrations by
their stationary values, r2 = k1r2/(λ1 + µ2), s2 =
k1s2/(λ1 + µ2). The approximation does not alter the
structure of the ﬁxed points for the system. The reduced
rate equations for monomers are obtained as

One notices that λ0, µ0 and µ1 do not appear explicitly
in eq.(3.13), but their eﬀects are implicitly included in
the values of concentrations, a and r + s.

As long as the concentrations a and r + s are positive,
the coeﬃcient B is always larger than A. If A is positive
asymptotically or at a ﬁxed point, then φ1 approaches
to a nonzero value as φ2
1 = A/B and the chiral state
will be selected. For example, if A > 0 at racemic ﬁxed
points (¯r = ¯s), they are unstable and the system may
evolve to chiral ﬁxed points. On the contrary, if A < 0 at
racemic ﬁxed points, they are stable. For µ0 = µ2 = 0,

the racemic ﬁxed point is easily obtained from eq.(3.7)
and eq.(3.8) as

Therefore, A is positive and the racemic ﬁxed point is

with µ1 > 8λ0. This region where the racemic ﬁxed point
is unstable is denoted by ”chiral” in the F

space in Fig.1(a). Parameters are ﬁxed at k0 = 0.1, k1 =
1, ke = 10 as well as at λ1 = µ1 = 1, and the decomposi-
tion rates back to achiral substrate λ0, λe are varied by
keeping the relation (3.4) satisﬁed. At a very large F , the
racemic ﬁxed point recovers stability, since ¯r = ¯s increase
and the chirality suppression factor λe(¯r + ¯s) in B due
to a ﬁnite back reaction rates λ0,e exceeds the chirality
enhancement factor ¯ake
λe ¯r. Therefore, by decreasing
the back reaction, the racemic ﬁxed point is expected to
remain unstable at large F . Actually, at λ0 = λe = 0, the
upper bound F2 diverges and the instability of racemic
ﬁxed point takes place for all F ’s larger than the lower
bound

(3.17)

When the back reaction is too strong as λ0 > µ1/8,
or when the substrate inﬂux is too strong as F
F2,
there remain plenty of achiral substrates and the ran-
dom production by k0 dominates over the catalytic pro-
duction with ke. When the substrate inﬂux is too weak
as F < F1, there are too few product chiral molecules to
sustain catalytic chiral enhancement. In those regions,
racemic ﬁxed point is the only possibility. With a small
decomposition λ0 < µ1/8 and with a moderate substrate
inﬂux, states with broken chirality are possible.

We note that the conclusions of the instability on the
racemic ﬁxed point remain valid for the full system, irre-
spective of the approximations. Equipped with these re-
sults, we carry out numerical integration of the full rate
equations (3.7) systematically. All concentrations except
r (or s) are set zero initially, and the initial value of r
(or s) is varied to obtain the ﬂow trajectories. The ﬂow
diagram in the phase space of the total concentrations of
two enantiomers, rΣ = r + 2r2 and sΣ = s + 2s2, shows
that the chiral symmetry breaking actually takes place in
the region denoted by ”chiral” in Fig.1(a). For example,
ﬂow trajectories at F = 0.5 with λ0/k0 = λe/ke = 0.6
in Fig.2(a) clearly shows the symmetry breaking: Fixed
points with broken chiral symmetry attract all the tra-
jectories.

Within the chiral region, the ﬁxed point value of φ varies
as the incoming ﬂux F , as shown in Fig.3(a). Due to
the symmetry, there is a trivial symmetric branch with
negative φ values, which is not shown. Near above the
lower bound F1, the ee increases continuously. Here, chi-
ral ﬁxed points lie close to the racemic one, and the
parameter A in eq.(3.13) is approximately written as
F ). Since the F and ¯r are small,

contributions of dimers r2 in r
is negligibly small. Thus
φ

As F increases, φ increases as well, and the chiral ﬁxed
point extends for F larger than F2, where the racemic
ﬁxed point recovers its stability. In fact, for F between F2
and F3 there are two types of stable ﬁxed points, racemic
and chiral, in the ﬂow diagram, as shown in Fig.2(b) at
F = 0.8. If the initial concentrations r and s for the
numerical integration of eq.(3.7) are close to the racemic
conﬁguration, the ﬁnal state remains racemic, since it is
stable, at least locally, as proven by the stability analysis.
However, if the integration start from a well developped
chiral conﬁguration, the chiral ﬁxed point is selected. The
concentration phase space of r’s and s’s is thus devided
into multiple basins of attractions to racemic and chiral
ﬁxed points. When F is larger than F3, the basins of
attraction to the chiral ﬁxed points seem to disppear.

From Fig.2(b) it is evident that for F between F2
and F3 there are unstable chiral ﬁxed points (marked by
white diamonds) between the racemic and stable chiral
ﬁxed points (marked by black boxes). Therefore, in the
F
φ diagram in Fig.3(a), there is another branch cor-
responding to these unstable chiral ﬁxed points, denoted
by a dashed curve: it extends from F3 back to the small
F direction below the stable chiral branch. The unstable
branch seems to be connected to the F axis at a point
F2.

The maximum value of ee in Fig. 3 is rather small.
This is due to the present choice of a parameter set,
especially k0, which is chosen rather large on purpose
so that the ﬁxed points are clearly discernible in ﬁgures.
With a parameter set in Fig.2(a), for example, the ee
takes a value φ = 0.871, but with a smaller value of k0
as k0 = 0.01, the ee increases up to φ =0.992 and the
stable chiral ﬁxed points lie almost on two axes.

Every aspect of the phase boundary and the ﬂow tra-
jectories remains the same, even if all the out-ﬂow rates
µi take ﬁnite values, for example µ0 = µ1 = µ2 = 1:
Phase diagram in F versus λ0/k0 in Fig.1(b) looks simi-
lar to that in Fig.1(a). When F takes the value between
F1 and F2, the racemic ﬁxed point is unstable and the
chiral symmetry breaks as shown in Fig.2(c). Between
F2 and F3, there is a hysteresis such that the station-
ary state depends on the initial concentrations of r’s and
s’s. From the lower bound F1 the ee increases continu-
ously until it drops suddenly to zero at F3, as shown in
Fig.3(b), where the expected unstable chiral ﬁxed points
are omitted.

We now consider cases without any direct back reac-
tion, λi = 0 for i = 1 to 3. Still, part of chiral products
is utilized for other purposes and disappears from the
catalyst production route, such that µi’s are ﬁnite. By
ﬁxing µ0 = µ2 = 1 and at various µ1, the chiral sym-
metry breaking is achieved at an incoming ﬂux F larger
than the lower bound, as shown in Fig.4(a). One notices
that there is a minimum in the lower bound of the in-
coming ﬂux F . With µ0 = µ1 = µ2 = 1, the ee increases
rapidly to the saturation value φ close to unity, as shown
in Fig.3(c). With small k0 and large ke, the saturation
to φ = 1 happens almost instantaneously.

With ﬁnite rates of back reactions, as λi = ki for ex-
ample, the out-going µ1 has to be suﬃciently large to
realize the chirality selection, as shown in Fig.4(b). The
symmetry breaking is possible for F between F1 and F3
with hysteresis above F2, similar to the previous cases in
Fig.1(a) and (b). The ee increases continuously from zero
at the lower bound F1, and drops abruptly to vanish at
the upper bound F3 with hysterisis above F2, as shown
in Fig.3(d).

4. Summary and Discussions

We extend our model of chiral molecule production
from achiral substrate with nonlinear autocatalysis to an
open system under ﬂow. Even if the back reaction is not
explicitly included, the system after a transient period is
shown to be eﬀectively described by the rate equations
we derived for a closed system with back reaction, and
the chirality selection is expected to take place. As an
ideal system to realize homochirality in laboratory, we
proposed the Soai reaction under ﬂow.

Organic molecules in life, amino acids for instance,
may not undergo nonlinear autocatalytic reaction, but
they polymerize and acquire some functions. One of them
is to catalyze various chemical reactions, presumably the
monomer production process as well. We construct a
model of chiral monomer production from achiral sub-
strate with further polymerization to produce enzymes
which enhance monomer production of the same ena-
tiomeric type. By assuming for simplicity that dimers
already act as enzymes, the rate equations of monomer
concentrations reduce to those with quadratic autocatal-
ysis in a steady-state approximation. In a closed system,
however, the enzyme enhances the decomposition process
as well, and the chiral symmetry is not broken. Only in
an open system where substrate is supplied and parts
of produced monomers and polymers are consumed for
other purposes, the chiral symmetry can be broken if pa-
rameters take proper values. Inﬂux of substrate should
be large to yield suﬃcient chiral products to sustain cat-
alytic process, but if the back reaction takes place the
inﬂux should not be too large. Otherwise, an enhanced
back reaction compensates the chirality enhancement.

We have considered only a single chiral species for
simplicity reason, whereas in reality there are 20 types
of amino acids. If only the same enantiomeric type can
form stable polymers, we believe that the present mecha-
nism of chirality selection is still valid for multiple chiral
species.

By extending the ladder for polymerization processes

until the enzyme is produced, the window in parame-
ter space for the chiral symmetry breaking becomes nar-
rower. Various disturbances due to spatial and temporal
variations may tend to narrow this window further. How-
ever narrow the parameter window may be, it is essential
that the window is open. After all, it seems to be a ma-
jority concensus that several hundred million years were
needed for the birth of life on the earth.

The form of the parameter B is so chosen that it remains

functions of relevant parameters and ﬁnds the conditions
for the chiral phase A > 0 or for the racemic phase A

as is discussed in section 3.

The other way to analyse the stability is the lin-
ear stability analysis. As a concrete example, we con-
sider the stability matrix for the full system eq.(3.7)
at the racemic ﬁxed point eq.(3.14) supplimented with
¯r2 = k1¯r2/(λ1 + µ2), ¯s2 = k1¯s2/(λ1 + µ2). Since there
are ﬁve independent variables as (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)
≡
(r, r2, s, s2, a) , the linear deviation around a ﬁxed point
¯xi is assumed to be xi = ¯xi + xi0 exp(Ωt). The equa-
tion to determine the eigenfrequency Ω is an eigenvalue
equation
5 dimensional
= 0, where I is the 5
unit matrix and the matrix elements of Γ are given as
Γij = ∂ ˙xi/∂xj evaluated at the ﬁxed point. In a matrix
form, it is expressed as

The instability condition for the racemic ﬁxed point is
the existence of positive eigenfrequency. As S + λ1 > 0 is
always satisﬁed, an inequality Sλ1
2k1T ¯r < 0 is just the
condition for the quadratic equation to have a positive
root and it can be shown that this condition agrees with
that given in section 3. As for the cubic equation, its
roots are near
2T < 0 and thus are
λ1 < 0,
expected to be negative. Numerically we conﬁrmed this
expectation for reasonable parameter ranges.

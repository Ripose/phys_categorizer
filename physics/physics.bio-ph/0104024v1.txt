Abstract

With tangent angle perturbation approach the axial symmetry deformation
of a spherical vesicle in large under the pressure changes is studied by the
elasticity theory of Helfrich spontaneous curvature model. Three main results
in axial symmetry shape: biconcave shape, peanut shape, and one type of
myelin are obtained. These axial symmetry morphology deformations are
in agreement with those observed in lipsome experiments by dark-ﬁeld light
microscopy [Hotani, J. Mol. Biol. 178, 113 (1984)] and in the red blood cell
with two thin ﬁlaments (myelin) observed in living state (see, Bessis, Living
Blood Cells and Their Ultrastructure, Springer-Verlag, 1973). Furthermore,
the biconcave shape and peanut shape can be simulated with the help of a
powerful software, Surface Evolver [Brakke, Exp. Math. 1, 141 (1992)], in
which the spontaneous curvature can be easy taken into account.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery of optical microscope, people have recognized that the human red
blood cells (RBCs) [1] and lipsomes [2] can be in many beautiful and strange shapes depend-
ing on the environment in which they exist, such as pH value, osmotic pressure diﬀerence.
The simplest model to explain these shapes is viewing RBC and lipsome as a vesicle of
amphiphile bilayers.

For a long time, both the experimental and the theoretical aspects of amphiphile bilay-
ers and monolayers have gathered much attention from physicists and chemists [3]. Helfrich
has shown the importance of spontaneous curvature and has developed a phenomenological
theory for the elasticity of ﬂuid membranes by an analogy with the curvature elasticity of
liquid crystals [4]. Many authors have studied the deformation of vesicles with diﬀerent
shapes among which the spherical vesicle plays a special role in these studies. The general
shape equation of vesicles has been derived with diﬀerential geometry method [5], then some
interesting numerical and analytical results have been reported [6,7]. In the equation, the
osmotic pressure diﬀerence between the external and internal sides of the vesicle membrane,
especially the spontaneous curvature, and elastic modulus are important quantities. Among
them, the inﬂuence of pressure on morphologic appearance of vesicle is the most important
one to be considered. In shape study, RBC becomes an attractive model of vesicle in living
cells. On the other hand, Hotani reported the lipsome shape transformation pathway when
it was put in solution at certain concentration, and pointed out that osmotic pressure was
found to be the driving force for the sequential transformations [2]. In the experiment the
concentration changes slowly, and so does pressure, therefore, the shape formation of the
lipsome can be seen as an equilibrium problem. In Hotani’s observation, single sphere ﬁnally
formed and seemed to be stable forms because they showed no further morphological change.
Jenkins and Peterson studied in detail the problem of the stability of RBC shapes [8], in
which spherical vesicle was limit case. Ou-Yang and Helfrich studied instability and defor-
mation of a spherical vesicle by pressure, and they found that any inﬁnitesimal deformation
corresponding to spherical harmonics Ylm would require a pressure diﬀerence larger than
some threshold values [9]. The nonaxisymmetric deformation of RBC is investigated with a
contour perturbation approach [10]. Obviously, the above approach is not able to deal with
a large deformation of a vesicle shape , such as the myelin form in RBCs [1]. It then becomes
a challenge to search for a method by which the large deformation of a spherical vesicle can
be treated in theory of perturbation. In the present work we report an useful issue on solving
the problem. The axial symmetry vesicle contour is expressed as Z =
tan Ψdρ where Ψ
is the tangent angle of the contour (see Fig. 1). One can ﬁnd that a small change of Ψ at
π/2 is able to cause a large deformation in contour. Just like the method of Deuling
Ψ
and Helfrich [6], we introduce an alternative variable of sin Ψ, u, thus, the contour Z will
change with considerable amplitude as sin Ψ has small perturbation. with the issue we can
calculate the large deformation of the contour via perturbation approach.

In this paper, we do some calculations about the large deformation of a spherical vesicle
with the new approach via pressure perturbation, varied biconcave shapes and one kind of
peanut shape can be obtained. Especially we show one type of myelin form with two long
ﬁlaments attaching on the spherical vesicle. To conﬁrm the analytic calculation we also
perform some computer simulations with the help of a powerful software, Surface Evolver

II. PERTURBATION THEORY

Equilibrium shapes of phospholipid vesicles are assumed to correspond to the local min-
ima of the elastic free energy of these systems. In the Helfrich spontaneous curvature model,
the spontaneous curvature plays a fundamental role in accounting for the diﬀerent morpho-
logic appearances of vesicles [4]. According to Helfrich’s theory, the free energy of a vesicle
is written as

F =

kc

(c1 + c2 −

where kc is the bending elastic modulus; c1 and c2 are the two principle curvatures of the
surface of the vesicle, c0 is the spontaneous curvature to describe the possible asymmetry of
the outer and inner layers of membrane, and dA and dV are the surface area and the volume
elements for the vesicle, respectively. The Lagrange Multipliers ∆p and λ take account of
the constraints of constant volume and area, respectively, and can be physically understood
as the pressure diﬀerence between the external and the internal environment and the surface
tensile coeﬃcient. The general shape equation has been derived via variational calculus [5]
to be

where ρ is the distance from the symmetric Z axis of rotation, Ψ(ρ) is the angle made by the

Jenkins [8], Ou-Yang and Helfrich [5] have studied the stability of the spherical vesicles.
Now we calculate the ﬁrst order pressure perturbation contribution to u using the Eq. (4).
When the pressure diﬀerence ∆p is slightly deviated from its equilibrium value ∆p0, i.e.
,
∆p = ∆p0 + δ∆p, Eq. (5) is no longer satisﬁed, what will be the shape of the vesicle? Here
we give an answer to this question with our detailed calculation.

By expanding u as u = u0 + u1 + u2 + ... with u1 ∼

Eq. (27) satisﬁes the general shape equation Eq. (4). It can give the biconcave shape [7] and
many interesting shapes described as have been shown in [16].

IV. BICONCAVE AND PEANUT SHAPE

With the help of microscopes people have made detailed observation of RBC which can
assume various shapes [1]. Generally, RBC takes biconcave disk shape (in blood capillary it
has very large deformation [17]), while some pathologic cells take other abnormality (such
as in sickle cell disease). If RBC is subjected to diﬀerent environment, various pH values
for example, it will make some considerable deformations, such as, Cup (Stomatocyte), Bell
(Codocyte), Sea urchin (Echinocyte) et al.. Moreover, beginning with biconcave lipsome
vesicle Hotani present many beautiful transformations among which the peanut shape was
included [2]. Surely the biconcave shape attracts many attention. In this section we use the
general theory of the section II to show that spherical vesicle can transform into biconcave
shape via pressure perturbation. Because Ψ = 0 at ρ = 0 and Ψ = π/2 at ρ = ρm (see
Fig. 1), there are two boundary conditions at ρ = 0 and ρ = ρm, i.e., ξ = 0 and ξ = ξm

So far, in the above solution there is still one relation to be determined. We can calculate it
via using the conservation of area of sphere. For a rotational surface the area element can
be expressed as

Using reduced dimensionless area sr deﬁned by ds = 4πr2
and another boundary condition to take account of the area conservation

Basing on Eq. (20), Eq. (29) and Eq. (30), the values of c10, c11 and c12 can be ﬁxed
completely. So the shape is also determined with Eq. (22). But in practical computation the
value of ξm in Eq. (30) can not be directly predicted. Therefore, in our computation, we treat
it as a free boundary problem, i.e., we let ξm takes a series of value, correspondingly, a series
of deformation of the original spherical vesicle and their total energy can be calculated [18].
The less total energy, the easier the deformation can be observed in practice (experiments).
From the Eq. (20) the diﬀerent shapes can be got via Eq. (22). We show our numerical
results in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. In fact, in Fig. 2 only the top right quadrant contours
of vesicle are shown.
In order to obtain the total vesicle surface two operations need to
be done in succession: at ﬁrst, rotate it with the Z axis, this give the upper part of the
surface; second, take mirror reﬂection. In order to describe the parameters corresponding
to the curves in Figs. 2-6, we deﬁne a new parameter v as v
V /V0 where V is the volume
of vesicle and V0 is the volume of original spherical vesicle. The pressure corresponding to
each curve is deﬁned as ∆p
, ∆p is the pressure related to the deformed vesicle while
∆p0 is the pressure diﬀerence of the original spherical vesicle. The shapes given in Fig. 2
are obtained at the constant spontaneous curvature and surface tension, i.e., c0r0 =-2.4 and
λr2

0.5), (0.05, 0.3), (0.01, 0.62) for curves 2-6, respectively. The curve 1 is the initial shape
of sphere. Two three-dimensional shapes of biconcave and peanut are shown in Fig. 3 and
Fig. 4, respectively. In principle, energy corresponding to every curve can be calculated with

0/kc = 0.01. The values of ( ∆p

the formula in [18]. The above calculated biconcave shape can be simulated on the basis of
the elasticity theory of Helfrich spontaneous curvature model by Surface Evolver [11]. The
simulated results, corresponding to biconcave and peanut shape, are shown in Fig. 5 and
Fig. 6, respectively, in which the A/A0 gives the ratio of surface area of vesicle to that of
the initial spherical vesicle. Both they are observed in blood cell [1] and lipsome vesicles [2].
Furthermore, We turn to analysis the behavior of deformation near rotational axis. After
obtaining the general solution Eq. (20), the behavior of deformation near the rotational axis
can be got by expanding it to ﬁrst order of p as

This equation describes the shape near polar points, and the equation is very similar to the
biconcave shape of red blood cell [7]. In this equation there is no any singular point in the

V. MYELIN FORM

Myelin form may originate from all blood cells [1]. Shadowing technique in microscopy
reveals that myelin forms are hollow structures. When a RBC is in aging, aged and damaged
states, it gives rise to large myelin forms which may take various types: ﬁlaments, beads
or strings of beads. These ﬁlaments, which are easily seen with phase contrast microscopy,
may remain attached to the surface of the RBC at one end. Here we choose the so called
Delaunay’s surface solution [7] from the general solution of the perturbation Eq. (6), which
can give a type of myelin form generating from the vesicle. In the book of Bessis [1], there is
a photo of this kind of Medusa head. Now let us ﬁrst discuss the general solution Eq. (20)
in the case of c11 = c12 = 0:

u = (1 +

)ξ + c10/ξ.

p
2b

Substituting it into the general shape equation Eq. (4) yields two relations: 1+p/2b = c0r0/2,
and ∆p = c0λ. It should be noticed that ∆p = ∆p0 + p. ∆p0 can be solved from Eq. (5),
then we ﬁnd

The value of c10 in Eq. (32) can be determined via boundary condition: u

With diﬀerent c0r0 and ξm, the various contours can be numerically calculated using Eq. (22)
(see Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). Not total length of ﬁlament is drawn in this two ﬁgures. In fact, those
ﬁlaments are swollen distally and our present calculation can not give an exact description
yet.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

Now we give here our main conclusions as what follows: With tangent angle perturba-
tion approach, we can calculate the large deformation of spherical vesicle under pressure
perturbation. From the general perturbation solutions, the biconcave and peanut shapes
can be obtained and a kind of myelin form is shown to be existed. Our all calculations are
based on the elasticity theory of Helfrich spontaneous curvature model and it does give good
accordance with some complex shapes of lipsome vesicles (see photographs in [2]) and RBCs
(see photographs in [1]) with computer simulation [19,1,2].

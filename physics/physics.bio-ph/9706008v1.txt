A cellular automaton model is presented for random walkers with biologically motivated interactions
favoring local alignment and leading to collective motion or swarming behavior. The degree of
alignment is controlled by a sensitivity parameter, and a dynamical phase transition exhibiting
spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry occurs at a critical parameter value. The model is
analyzed using nonequilibrium mean ﬁeld theory: Dispersion relations for the critical modes are
derived, and a phase diagram is constructed. Mean ﬁeld predictions for the two critical exponents
describing the phase transition as a function of sensitivity and density are obtained analytically.

When in the course of evolutionary events it became
possible for cells to actively crawl and move towards more
favorable habitats, this led to an acceleration of evo-
lutionary change. Another important step was the de-
velopment of social behavior, manifested in cooperative
motion of individual cells or organisms. In particular, a
change from independent crawling to cooperative motion
is typical of life cycles in many microorganisms.

Moving cells can orient themselves by means of indirect
physico-chemical signals like electrical ﬂuxes or molecular
concentration gradients; the response of individual cells
to such environmental information may result in collec-
tive streaming behavior and swarm patterns. Many mod-
els have been formulated along these lines of argument,
all focusing on similar aspects of physico-chemical com-
munication (see examples in Ref. [1]).

Here we are interested in the implications of direct com-
munication between biological units (e.g. cells or birds).
Based on the assumption that the units have an inherent
direction of motion, and try to locally align with other
units, several microscopic models for swarming behavior
have recently been proposed [2–4]. These models can be
viewed as itinerant XY -models that can be analyzed us-
ing renormalization group methods, starting from a pos-
tulated equation of motion [5].

In this Letter we take a diﬀerent approach. We deﬁne a
cellular automaton model [6] that has the necessary fea-
tures to produce swarming behavior, while the discrete-
ness in time and space allows for relatively easy analy-
sis. We analyze our model directly, using an approximate
mean-ﬁeld kinetic equation, and identify and derive dis-
persion relations for the various collective modes. An
important question is how alignment is achieved, start-
ing from a random spatial distribution. We show that
swarm formation is associated with a continuous dynam-
ical phase transition, occurring when a sensitivity pa-
rameter reaches a critical value. Spontaneous symmetry
breaking leads to states with a global particle drift. The
initial formation of patches is related to the fact that

only at suﬃciently large wavenumbers the density and
longitudinal momentum modes merge to form a pair of
propagating sound modes. We calculate the critical expo-
nents governing the behavior of the average drift velocity
close to criticality.

The model we use is a lattice gas cellular automaton
[7] deﬁned on a two-dimensional L
L square lattice with
periodic boundary conditions. Each node r can contain
up to four particles in diﬀerent velocity channels corre-
sponding to nearest neighbor vectors ci = (cos φi, sin φi)
with φi = π(i
4. The state of the
entire lattice at time t is speciﬁed by the occupation num-
bers si(r, t) = 0, 1 denoting the absence resp. presence of
a particle in the channel (r, ci). The state of node r is
denoted by s(r, t) =

1)/2 and 1

The evolution from time t to time t + 1 proceeds in

rules that are applied to each node r independently; the
interaction step is followed by a propagation step dur-
ing which particles move to nearest neighbor sites in the
direction of their velocity, i.e., si(r + ci, t + 1) = σi(r, t).

parameter β, playing the role of an inverse temperature,
controls the degree of local alignment: for β = 0 there
is no alignment at all; for β
the two-dimensional
J(σ) — and therefore the local align-
inner product D
ment — is maximized. It will turn out that a dynamical
phase transition occurs at a critical value βc of the sen-
sitivity. Figure 1 shows the time evolution of an initially
random distribution for β > βc. The formation of lo-
cally aligned patches can clearly be observed. There is
some anisotropy due to the square lattice; it is however
straightforward to extend the model to the triangular lat-
tice. It is an interesting question whether the phase or-
dering kinetics shown in Fig. 1 can be described in terms
of dynamical scaling theory [8].

To analyze the behavior of the model we consider the
time evolution of a statistical ensemble of systems. For
technical details we refer to Ref. [9], where a model with
only slightly diﬀerent interaction rules [10] yet entirely
diﬀerent behavior was analyzed. In a mean-ﬁeld descrip-
tion a central role is played by the average occupation

Γij(k = 0) has an eigenvalue λ1 = 1 with corresponding
eigenvector e1 = (1, 1, 1, 1), reﬂecting the fact that the to-
tal density is conserved. Furthermore there is a twofold
degenerate eigenvalue λx,y = 8α with an eigenspace

sponding to the x- and y components of the total particle

ence between the number of horizontally and vertically
moving particles. Numerically γ is found to be about
two orders of magnitude smaller than α, so that the on-
set of instability of the homogeneous state is determined
by the condition λx,y = 1. The location of the criti-
cal line in the (β, ¯ρ) parameter plane is shown in Fig. 2,
which was obtained by numerically solving the equation

To see if in addition to the emergence of a global
drift we can explain the formation of spatial structure
in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum, we study the case
= 0. It is convenient to work with z(k) = ln λ(k) so
k
that excitations behave as δf (r, t)
r].
Unstable modes have Re z(k) > 0 while stable modes
have Re z(k) < 0. An imaginary part of z(k) indi-
cates that the mode has a nonzero propagation veloc-
ity v(k) = Im z(k)/
k
. Figure 3 shows that the fastest

|
growth occurs at k = 0. For k
= 0 the degeneracy of
λx,y is lifted, and it is then the transverse velocity (i.e.,
perpendicular to k) that grows fastest. At
= kp,
with kp = kp(ˆk, ¯ρ, β), where ˆk is the unit vector in
the direction of k, the density and longitudinal velocity
modes merge to form a pair of propagating sound-like
modes, with Im z(k)
= 0, and traveling in the directions
ˆk. Thus, traveling waves cannot occur on spatial scales
±
larger than 2π/kp, which may explain the length scale
for short times of the spatial structure shown in Fig. 1.
Our mean-ﬁeld stability analysis illuminates the nature
of the observed phase transition. An appropriate order

¯µ = 0. When the sensitivity parameter β reaches its

to a breaking of rotational symmetry, and a stationary
state where ¯µ

We have compared the results of our stability analysis
with computer simulations. Fig. 4 shows ¯µ versus β for
averaged density ¯ρ = 0.4. There is an abrupt change
in ¯µ at β

βc = 0.67 obtained from our stability analysis.

The essential elements of our analysis are the “hydro-
dynamic” variables density and velocity. Therefore we
expect that many of our predictions — including the
value of the critical exponents — should also apply to the
continuum swarming model of Ref. [3]. From a coarse-
grained point of view our model and that of Ref. [3] are
equivalent. In particular the noise parameter η in Ref. [3]
plays a role analogous to 1/β in our model.

Our analysis conﬁrms the numerical ﬁnding of Ref. [3]
that the phase transition is continuous, but is in con-
ﬂict with the results of Ref. [2]. The exponents β′ and
δ have been measured in computer simulations [3]. The
measured value β′ = 0.45
0.07 is in agreement with
our mean-ﬁeld prediction β′ = 1
2 . In the case of δ how-
ever there is a signiﬁcant deviation between the measured
0.06 and the mean-ﬁeld result δ = 1
value δ = 0.35
2 .
The fact that at a mean-ﬁeld level β′ and δ are equal
supports a claim made by the authors of Ref. [3] that the
observed diﬀerence between the measured values of the
two exponents may be due to ﬁnite-size eﬀects.

Our model has an interesting biological interpretation
since the dynamical phase transition suggests two possi-
ble scenarios for a change from non-cooperative to co-
operative behavior. On one hand, genetically caused
minor microscopic eﬀects on receptor properties of in-
teracting cells inﬂuencing their sensitivity can have se-
vere macroscopic implications with respect to swarming
if they occur close to criticality (cf. Fig. 2). On the other
hand, a transition from the stable into the unstable re-
gion can also be achieved by simply increasing cell density
(cf. Fig. 2). This result provides a possible clue to ex-
plain the behavioral change between non-cooperative and
cooperative stages in individual life cycles of some bac-
teria and amoebae in which a reproductive feeding phase
of individually moving cells is followed by social (coordi-
nated) aggregation. Other models for complex bacterial
pattern formation, including vortex and colony organi-
zation, have also been proposed (see Refs. [14,15] and
references therein).

Finally, we want to stress that the methods employed
here can easily be adapted to gain theoretical insight in
the behavior of a wide range of biologically motivated
cellular automaton models, that so far have mainly been

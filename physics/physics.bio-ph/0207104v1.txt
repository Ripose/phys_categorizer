Photosystem I is a protein-pigment complex that performs photosynthesis in plants, green algae,
and cyanobacteria.
It contains an aggregate of chlorophylls that absorbs light and delivers the
resulting electronic excitation to the special pair of chlorophylls where the excitation energy is used
for producing charge separation across the cell membrane. The seemingly random arrangement
of chlorophylls in photosystem I poses the question which pathways excitation migration follows
towards the special pair after absorption of light at any of its chlorophylls. We employ a master
equation to describe the process of excitation migration in photosystem I, and ﬁnd representative
paths of excitation migration based on the mean ﬁrst-passage time from each chlorophyll to the
special pair. The resulting paths, beginning at each of the chlorophylls and ending at the special
pair, provide a complete yet distilled picture of the excitation migration towards the special pair.

Introduction

Photosynthesis is carried out by pigment-protein com-
plexes embedded in cell membranes. An aggregate of
interacting pigments held in a ﬁxed arrangement in such
a complex absorbs light and delivers the resulting elec-
tronic excitation to a reaction center, which uses the ex-
citation energy to produce a charge separation across the
cell membrane [1]. The transmembrane potential induced
by this charge separation is later used for the synthesis
of ATP.

Among the photosynthetic complexes, the photosyn-
thetic unit of purple bacteria has been most exten-
sively studied; for a review see [2]. Recently, a high-
resolution structure of photosystem I (PSI) has been ob-
tained from cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus [3].
PSI along with photosystem II constitutes the machin-
ery of oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, green algae, and
cyanobacteria. PSI contains an aggregate of 96 chloro-
phylls, including the special pair P700, where charge sep-
aration is initiated. The chlorophylls are arranged with-
out an apparent order, except for an apparent pseudo-
C2 symmetry, which is in contrast to the highly sym-
metric arrangement of bacteriochlorophylls in the pho-
tosynthetic unit of purple bacteria. The rather ran-
dom arrangement of chlorophylls in PSI poses the ques-
tion which pathways excitation migration follows towards
P700 after any of its chlorophylls has absorbed light.

The rates of inter-chlorophyll excitation transfer in PSI
have been calculated based on F¨orster theory [4, 5, 6].
Excitation follows a stochastic trajectory along the exci-
tation transfer network given by these rates. However,
the obscure pattern of the excitation transfer network in
PSI (cf. Fig. 6 in Ref. [4]) instills a need for a simpler
and more distilled picture of excitation migration. Also,
the aspect that the special pair P700 is the target of the
excitation migration process is not incorporated in the
excitation transfer network solely given by the transfer

rates. Therefore, we seek paths directed towards P700
that are representative of all events of excitation migra-
tion towards P700 in a way that actual migration tra-
jectories can be considered as noisy trajectories around
those representative paths.

The task of ﬁnding such representative pathways is also
encountered in the so-called reaction-path problem [7, 8].
Recently, a new approach to the reaction-path problem
was suggested [9], where mean ﬁrst-passage times were
employed as reaction coordinates and reaction paths were
constructed from them. The suggested method is appli-
cable to discrete systems such as excitation migration in

method to ﬁnd excitation migration pathways in PSI.

Theory

Excitation migration in PSI is a stochastic process gov-
erned by the rates of inter-chlorophyll transfer, dissipa-
tion (internal conversion of excitation to heat), and the
charge separation at P700. We build a master equation
describing the process, calculate the mean ﬁrst-passage
time for excitation migration from each chlorophyll to
P700, and then ﬁnd pathways representative of the ex-
citation migration in the excitation transfer network of
the chlorophyll aggregate towards the P700 pair.

The process of excitation migration can be described
in terms of the probability Pij (t) that an excitation, ini-
tiated by light absorption at chlorophyll j, resides at
chlorophyll i after time interval t. The inter-chlorophyll
transfer rates Ti→j from chlorophyll i to chlorophyll j
are calculated as explained in Ref. [5]. For the calcula-
tion of Ti→j, we use the recently obtained site energies for
chlorophylls [6] and the inter-chlorophyll electronic cou-
plings given by a full Coulomb computation that includes
all multipole contributions to the coupling [5]. The dissi-
pation rate is assumed to be the same (kdiss = (1 ns)−1) at
all the chlorophylls. Since we are here interested in paths
along which excitation migrates towards P700, it is suﬃ-
cient to consider only ﬁrst passages of excitation to P700.
(The ﬁrst passage corresponds to the ﬁrst term in the so-

called sojourn expansion whose higher-order terms cover
subsequent escapes and returns to P700 [5].) Thus, the
charge-separation rate is not needed in the model, and
the transfer rates from P700 to the other chlorophylls
can be set to zero. Collecting these rates, we obtain the
master equation [10]

Pij(t) =

From the master equation (Eq. 1) we derive a backward
master equation which is used for calculating the mean
ﬁrst-passage time [11, 12]. Since excitation migration is a
Markov process, the probability Pij (t) can be expressed
as

Pij (t) =

In the model constructed above, excitation can exit
the system by two means: the delivery to P700 and dis-
sipation. We emphasize again that we only consider ﬁrst
passages to P700. Thus, it is convenient to consider a
subsystem of 94 chlorophylls, excluding the P700 pair of
chlorophylls. The subsystem is described by the master
equation

to the P700 chlorophylls.

Here φα is the total probability that the excitation is
eventually delivered to P700. Since the excitation may be
dissipated before it reaches P700, φα is less than one and
the denominator in Eq. 8 is necessary for normalization.
From Eqs. 7, 8, and 9, we obtain equations for φα and
τα:

The mean ﬁrst-passage time τi (τi = 0 for i ∈ P700) is a
natural measure of the progress in the excitation migra-
tion towards the P700 pair [9]; chlorophylls associated
with shorter mean ﬁrst-passage times are closer to the
target (P700) in the migration process. As suggested in
Ref. [9], we construct excitation migration paths accord-
ing to the scheme that a path going through chlorophyll
i chooses the next chlorophyll j such that Ti→j(τi−τj) is
maximized. The resulting paths can be considered rep-
resentative because the mean ﬁrst-passage time τi is an
average over all events of the excitation migration from
chlorophyll i to P700. For a transfer step from chloro-
phyll i to chlorophyll j, the quantity 1/Ti→j may be in-
terpreted as a cost, and τi − τj as a gain. The scheme
then amounts to maximizing the gain-cost ratio for each
step.

Results and Discussion

The above method yields the mean ﬁrst-passage
time and the paths shown in Fig. 1. The 96 chloro-
phylls are sorted in the order of
increasing mean
ﬁrst-passage time and are listed in Fig. 1(c). The
excitation migration paths shown in Fig. 1(a) exhibits

FIG. 1: Mean ﬁrst-passage time and pathways of excitation migration in PSI. (a) The chlorophylls, projected onto the
membrane plane, are denoted by circles color-coded according to the mean ﬁrst-passage time to the P700 pair. The excitation
migration paths constructed based on the mean ﬁrst-passage time are shown as arrows. (b) The mean ﬁrst-passage time is
plotted in the increasing order. The color-code scheme is the same as in (a). (c) The chlorophylls are sorted in the order of
increasing mean ﬁrst-passage time. The nomenclature (eC-A1, etc) follows Ref. [3]. ‘Red chlorophyll’ candidates are marked
with red dots in (a) and (c).

a network without an apparent order, as expected
from the arrangement of the chlorophylls. There are
various paths, including six direct paths to P700 (from
chlorophylls eC-A2, eC-B2, A24, A26, B5, and B24)
and the most complicated path composed of nine
(A21→PL1→A22→A30→B37→B38→B39→eC-
steps
B3→eC-A2→eC-B1). We here emphasize again that
excitation does not necessarily follow these paths, but
that they should be understood as representative paths.
As can be seen from Fig. 1(b), most of the chloro-
phylls (9th to 96th) have mean ﬁrst-passage times around
or above 10 ps, with the average over all being 12.5 ps.
Chlorophylls A40 and B39 lie between these peripheral
chlorophylls and the reaction-center chlorophylls which
coincide with the six chlorophylls with the shortest mean
ﬁrst-passage times. This supports to a certain extent the
suggestion that chlorophylls A40 and B39 connect the
reaction-center chlorophylls and the peripheral chloro-
phylls [3]. But, among the found excitation migration
paths to P700, many go through neither chlorophyll A40
nor B39. Therefore, these two chlorophylls are not the
only connection between the reaction center and the pe-
riphery, and should not be considered as bottlenecks.

The last chlorophyll in Fig. 1(c), chlorophyll M1, raises
a question as its mean ﬁrst-passage time (18.8 ps) is much
longer than the second longest one (15.6 ps). This does
not imply that excitation is trapped at this chlorophyll;
18.8 ps is still much shorter than the dissipation time of
1 ns. But, it seems inappropriate that one chlorophyll is
located relatively farther from the rest. PSI exists as a
trimer in vivo [3, 13] and chlorophyll M1 lies close to the
boundary between monomers. By computing the elec-
tronic couplings between chlorophyll M1 and the chloro-
phylls in the next monomer, we ﬁnd that chlorophyll M1
is coupled to chlorophyll A30 in the next monomer with

4

the coupling of 52.9 cm−1, which is much stronger than
the strongest coupling it has within its own monomer
(6.7 cm−1 with B8). Chlorophyll M1 functionally belongs
to the next monomer, not its own monomer.

In PSI, it is experimentally known that seven to eleven
chlorophylls absorb light at longer wavelengths than the
special pair P700 [14, 15]. These ‘red chlorophylls’ have
not been identiﬁed with certainty, but some candidates
(marked with red dots in Figs. 1(a) and (c)) have been
proposed [3, 4, 5, 6]. Most of the candidates are found
to be located rather close to P700 in terms of not only
spatial distance but also the mean ﬁrst-passage time.
Chlorophylls A38, A39, B37, and B38 have the shortest
mean ﬁrst-passage times among peripheral chlorophylls
(except for B39 and A40). With regard to the represen-
tative paths shown in Fig. 1(a), chlorophylls A24, A32,
A38, B22, B24, and B26 are one step away from the
reaction-center chlorophylls, and chlorophylls A39, B6,
and B38 are one step away from the ‘connecting chloro-
phylls’, A40 and B39.

In conclusion, we have found representative paths of
excitation migration in PSI based on mean ﬁrst-passage
times. The mean ﬁrst-passage time and the paths provide
a complete yet distilled picture of the excitation migra-
tion towards P700 as illustrated in Fig. 1. We expect
that our methodology will be useful for various light-
harvesting complexes as more of their high-resolution
structures become available.

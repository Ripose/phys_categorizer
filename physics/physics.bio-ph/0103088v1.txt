Neural coding of naturalistic motion stimuli

Abstract.

We study a wide ﬁeld motion sensitive neuron in the visual system of the blowﬂy
Calliphora vicina. By rotating the ﬂy on a stepper motor outside in a wooded area,
and along an angular motion trajectory representative of natural ﬂight, we stimulate
the ﬂy’s visual system with input that approaches the natural situation. The neural
response is analyzed in the framework of information theory, using methods that are
free from assumptions. We demonstrate that information about the motion trajectory
increases as the light level increases over a natural range. This indicates that the
ﬂy’s brain utilizes the increase in photon ﬂux to extract more information from the
photoreceptor array, suggesting that imprecision in neural signals is dominated by
photon shot noise in the physical input, rather than by noise generated within the
nervous system itself.

1. Introduction

One tried and tested way to study sensory information processing by the brain is
to stimulate the sense organ of interest with physically appropriate stimuli and to
observe the responses of a selected part of the system that lends itself to measurement.
Within that framework there are strong incentives, both practical and analytical,
to simplify stimuli. After all, short lightﬂashes or constant tones are easier to
generate and to capture mathematically than the everchanging complex world outside
the laboratory. Fortunately, sense organs and brains are extremely adaptive, and
they apparently function in sensible ways, even in the artiﬁcial conditions of typical
laboratory experiments. A further reason for using simpliﬁed stimuli is that they are
presumed to elicit simple responses, facilitating interpretation of the system’s input-
output behaviour in terms of underlying mechanism. Typically, these simple stimuli are
repeated a large number of times, the measured outputs are averaged, and this average
is deﬁned to be the ‘meaningful’ component of the response. This is especially helpful
in the case of spiking neurons, where we face the embarrasment of the action potential:
Because they are an extremely nonlinear feature of the neural response we often do not
really know how to interpret sequences of action potentials (Rieke et al , 1997). One
way to evade the question and save tractability is to work with derived observables, in
particular with smooth functions of time, such as the average ﬁring rate.

Although it certainly is useful to perform experiments with simpliﬁed inputs, one
also would like to know how those stimuli are processed and encoded that an animal is
likely to encounter in nature. We expect animals to be ‘designed’ for those conditions,
and it will be interesting to see to what extent the brain can keep up with the range
and strength of these stimuli. In the present work we are concerned primarily with the
question of how noisy neural information processing really is. This question cannot be
answered satisfactorily if we do not study the problem that the brain is designed to
solve, because for us it is hard to distinguish willful neglect on the part of the brain in
solving artiﬁcial tasks, from noisiness of its components.

As soon as we try to characterize the behaviour of a sensory system in response to
the complex, dynamic, nonrepeated signals presented by the natural world, we lose many
of the simpliﬁcations mentioned earlier. To meet the challenge we must modify both our
experimental designs and our methods for analyzing the responses to these much more
complicated inputs. Recent examples of laboratory based approaches to the problem of
natural stimulation are studies of bullfrog auditory neurons responding to synthesized
frog calls (Rieke et al
, 1995), insect olfactory neurons responding to odour plumes
(Vickers et al , 2001), cat LGN cells responding to movies (Dan et al , 1996, Stanley et
al , 1999), primate visual cortical cells during free viewing of natural images (Gallant
et al , 1998, Vinje and Gallant, 2000), auditory neurons in song birds stimulated by
song and song–like signals (Theunissen and Doupe, 1998, Theunissen et al , 2000, Sen
et al , 2000), the responses in cat auditory cortex to signals with naturalistic statistical
properties (Rotman et al , 1999), and motion sensitive cells in the ﬂy (Warzecha and
Egelhaaf, 2001, de Ruyter van Steveninck et al , 2001). In each case compromises are
struck between well controlled stimuli with understandable statistical properties and
the fully natural case.

A more radical approach to natural stimulation was taken by Roeder in the early
sixties (see Roeder, 1998). He and his coworkers made recordings from moth auditory
neurons in response to the cries of bats ﬂying overhead in the open ﬁeld. More recently
the visual system of Limulus was studied with the animal moving almost free on the sea
ﬂoor (Passaglia et al , 1997).

Here we study motion sensitive visual neurons in the ﬂy, and—in the spirit of
Roeder’s work—rather than trying to construct approximations to natural stimuli in
the laboratory, we take the experiment into nature. We record the responses of H1, a
wide ﬁeld direction selective neuron that responds to horizontal motion, while the ﬂy
is being rotated along angular velocity trajectories representative for free ﬂying ﬂies.
These trajectories indeed are quite wild, with velocities of several thousand degrees
In
per second and direction changes which are complete within ten milliseconds.
analyzing the responses to these stimuli we would like to use methods that do not
depend on detailed assumptions about what features of the stimulus are encoded or
about what features of the spike sequences carry this coded signal. Recently, information
theoretical methods were developed for analysing neural responses to repeated sequences
of otherwise arbitrarily complex stimuli (de Ruyter van Steveninck et al , 1997, Strong et
al , 1998). In our experiments we repeat the same motion trace, lasting several seconds,
and this provides us with the raw data for computing the relevant information measures,
as explained in section 2.3. We emphasize that although we repeat the stimulus many
times to estimate the relevant probability distributions of responses, the measures we
derive from these distributions characterize the information coded by a single example
of the neural response.

2. Methods

2.1. Stimulus design considerations

The giant motion sensitive interneurons in the ﬂy’s lobula plate are sensitive primarily
to such rigid rotational motions of the ﬂy as occur during ﬂight (Hausen, 1982, Krapp et
al , 1997), and these cells typically have very large visual ﬁelds. It is this wide ﬁeld rigid
rotation that we want to reproduce as we construct a naturalistic stimulus. But what
pattern of rotational velocities should we use? As a benchmark we will present data
from an experiment where the ﬂy was rotated at velocities that remained constant for
one second each. We would, however, also like to present the ﬂy with stimuli that are
more representative for natural ﬂight. Free ﬂight trajectories were recorded in the classic
work of Land and Collett (1974), who studied chasing behaviour in Fannia canicularis
and found body turning speeds of several thousand degrees per second. A recent study
(van Hateren and Schilstra, 1999) reports ﬂight measurements from Calliphora at high
temporal and spatial resolution. In these experiments ﬂies made of order 10 turns per
second, and turning speeds of the head reached values of over 3000◦/s.
In general,
high angular velocities pose problems for visual stimulus displays, because even at
relatively high frame rates they may give rise to ghost images. In our laboratory we use
a Tektronix 608 display monitor with a 500 Hz frame rate,. Then 3000◦/s corresponds
to jumps from frame to frame of 6◦,
four times larger than the spacing between
photoreceptors. Although the frame rate used here is well above the photoreceptor
ﬂicker fusion frequency (de Ruyter van Steveninck and Laughlin, 1996) the presence
of ghost images may have consequences for the encoding of motion signals. Further,
the light intensity of the typical displays used in the laboratory is much lower than
outside. As an example, the Tektronix 608 induces of order 5 · 104 photoconversions/s
in ﬂy photoreceptors at its maximum brightness. The brightness outside can easily be a
factor of a hundred higher (Land, 1981), although the photoreceptor pupil mechanism
will limit the maximum photon ﬂux to about 106 photoconversions/s (Howard et al ,
1987). Finally, the ﬁeld of view of H1 is very large, covering essentially the ﬁeld of one
eye (Krapp and Hengstenberg, 1997), which is about 6.85 sr or 55% of the full 4π sr in
female Calliphora vicina (estimates based on Beersma et al , 1977. See also Fig. 1).
In practice with a display monitor it is hard to stimulate the ﬂy with coherent motion
over such a large area and in most of our laboratory experiments we stimulate less than
about 20% of the full visual ﬁeld of H1.

2.2. Stimulus apparatus

All the factors mentioned above suggest an experimental design in which the visual world
can be made to move more or less continuously relative to the ﬂy, and this is easiest
to accomplish by moving the ﬂy relative to the world as occurs during free ﬂight. We
therefore constructed a light and compact assembly consisting of a ﬂy holder, electrode
manipulator, and preampliﬁer that can be mounted on a stepper motor, as shown in

Neural coding of naturalistic motion stimuli

ﬁgure 1. This setup is rigid enough to allow high speed rotations around the vertical
axis while extracellular recordings are made from the H1 cell. Because it is powered by
batteries the setup can be taken outside, so that the ﬂy’s visual system is stimulated
with natural visual scenes. The mounting and recording stage inevitably covers some
area in the ﬂy’s visual ﬁeld. During the experiment this rotates along with the ﬂy,
and so does not contribute to motion in the ﬂy’s visual ﬁeld. By tracing the contours
of the setup as seen from the ﬂy, we estimate the shape and size of this overlap, as
depicted in ﬁgure 1. The setup was designed to minimize the overlap in the visual ﬁeld
of the left eye. In the experiments presented here, recordings were therefore made from
contralateral H1, on the right side of the head. The setup occludes only 1.52 sr, or 22%,
of the visual ﬁeld of the left eye, most of it ventral-caudal, as indicated by the heavy
mesh in the right panel of ﬁgure 1.

The stepper motor (Berger-Lahr RDM 564/50) was driven by a Divistep 331.1
controller in microstep mode, that is, at 104 steps per revolution, corresponding to
a smallest step size of 0.036◦ or roughly 1/30th of an interommatidial angle. The
Divistep controller in turn was driven by pulses from a custom designed interface that
produced pulse trains by reading pulse frequency values from the parallel port of a
laptop computer. Pulse frequency values were refreshed every 2 ms.

To generate naturalistic motion stimuli we used published trajectories of chasing
Fannia from Land and Collett (1974), interpolated smoothly between their 20 ms sample
points. For technical reasons we had to limit the accelerations of the setup, and we chose
therefore to rotate the ﬂy at half the rotational velocities derived from the Land and
Collett data. This may be reasonable as Calliphora is a larger ﬂy than Fannia, and
is likely to make slower turns. The constant velocity data presented in ﬁgure 2 were
taken with rotation speeds ranging from about 0.28◦/s to 4500◦/s. To avoid extreme
accelerations during high velocity presentations the pulse program for the stepper motor
delivered smooth 100 ms pulse frequency ramps to switch between velocities. For
velocities below 18◦/s pulses were sent to the controller at intervals longer than 2 ms.
At the lowest constant velocity used in our experiments, 0.28◦/s, pulses were delivered
at 128 ms intervals. The step size was small enough so that a modulation of the PSTH
was undetectable in the experiment.

The experiment of ﬁgure 2 compares data from the outdoor setup to data taken
inside with the ﬂy observing a Tektronix 608 CRT. The stimulus displayed on this
monitor consisted of 190 vertical lines, with intensities derived from a one-dimensional
scan of the scene viewed by the ﬂy in the outdoor experiment. The moving scene was
generated by a digital signal processor, and written at a 500 Hz frame rate. As mentioned
above, this gives rise to ghosting at high image speeds when the pattern makes large
jumps from frame to frame. The DSP produced the coarse part of motion essentially
by stepping through lines in a buﬀer memory. On top of this, ﬁne displacements were
produced by moving the entire image by fractions of a linewidth at each frame. The
resulting motion was smooth and not limited to integer steps. The ﬂy was positioned
so that the screen subtended a rectangular area of 67◦ horizontal by 55◦ vertical, with

the left eye facing the CRT and rightmost vertical edge of the CRT approximately in
the sagittal plane of the ﬂy’s head.

2.3. Information theoretic analysis of neural ﬁring patterns

We describe brieﬂy a technique for quantifying information transmission by spike trains
(de Ruyter van Steveninck et al , 1997, Strong et al , 1998, de Ruyter van Steveninck et
al , 2001). We consider segments of the spike train with length T divided in a number
of bins of width ∆t, where ∆t ranges from one millisecond up to ∆t = T . Each such
bin may hold a number of spikes, but within a bin no distinction is made on where
the spikes appear. However, two windows of length T that have diﬀerent combinations
of ﬁlled bins are counted as diﬀerent ﬁring patterns. Also, two windows in which the
same bins are ﬁlled but with diﬀerent count values, are distinguished. We refer to such
ﬁring patterns as words, WT,∆t. From an experiment in which we repeat a reasonably
long naturalistic stimulus a number of times, Nr (here Nr = 200 repetitions of a Tr = 5
seconds long sequence) we get a large number of these words, WT,∆t(t), with t the time
since the start of the experiment. Here we discretize t in 1 ms bins, giving us 5000
words per repetition period, and 106 words in the entire experiment. From this set of
words we set up word probability distributions, from which we calculate total and noise
entropies, and their diﬀerence, according to Shannon’s deﬁnitions:

(i) The total entropy, Stot(T, ∆t). From the list of words WT,∆t(t), for all t (0 ≤ t ≤
Nr ·Tr), we directly get a distribution, P (WT,∆t) describing the probability of ﬁnding
a word anywhere in the entire experiment. The total entropy is now:

Stot(T, ∆t) = −

P (WT,∆t) · log2[P (WT,∆t)]

(1)

XW

This entropy measures the richness of the ‘vocabulary’ used by H1 under these
experimental conditions, hence the time of occurrence of the pattern within the
experiment is irrelevant.

(ii) The average noise entropy, ¯Snoise(T, ∆t).

If the neuron responded perfectly
reproducibly to repeated stimuli, then the information conveyed by the spike train
would equal the total entropy deﬁned above. There is noise, however, and this leads
to variations in the responses, as can be seen directly from the rasters in Fig. 3.
¯Snoise(T, ∆t) gives us an estimate of how variable the response to identical stimuli is.
We ﬁrst accumulate, for each instant tr in the stimulus sequence, the distribution
of all those ﬁring patterns P (WT,∆t|tr), taken across all trials, that begin at tr (note
that 0 ≤ tr ≤ Tr). The entropy of this distribution measures the (ir)reproducibility
of the response at each instant tr:

Snoise(T, ∆t, tr) = −

P (WT,∆t|tr) · log2[P (WT,∆t|tr)].

(2)

Calculating this for each point in time and averaging all these values we obtain the
average noise entropy:

¯Snoise(T, ∆t) =

Snoise(T, ∆t, tr)dtr.

(iii) The information conveyed by words at the given length T and resolution ∆t is the

diﬀerence of these two entropies:

I(T, ∆t) = Stot(T, ∆t) − ¯Snoise(T, ∆t).

The coding eﬃciency of the spike train is the fraction of the total entropy that is
utilized to convey information:

(4)

(5)

η(T, ∆t) =

I(T, ∆t)
Stot(T, ∆t)

.

Small values of η(T, ∆t) indicate a loose coupling between stimulus and spike train,
whereas values close to 1 imply that there is little noise entropy, so that most of the
structure of the spike train is meaningful, and carries a message. Here we will not be
interested in the decoding question, that is in what that message is, but only in how
much information is conveyed about the stimulus. We will then compare these values
in diﬀerent conditions.

It should be stressed that the information values we derive by these methods are
not strictly about velocity. They are potentially about anything in the stimulus that is
repetitive with period Tr. It is our job as experimenters to construct inputs that we think
will stimulate the neuron well, and for H1, naturalistic wide ﬁeld motion seems to be a
good choice. But that does not necessarily mean that that is the best choice. Further,
the motion pattern is dynamic, and any noiseless time invariant operation on this signal
will produce a result that has the same repeat period as the original. Our information
measures do not distinguish these cases; speciﬁcally, our discussion is unaﬀected by
the question of whether H1 encodes velocity, acceleration, or some nonlinear function
of these variables. Questions of decoding are highly interesting, but at the same time
diﬃcult to tackle for stimuli of the type studied here, and we will leave them aside in
this paper.

It is interesting to try and estimate I(T, ∆t) as we let T become very long, and
∆t very short, as this limit is the average rate of information transmission. Because
calculating this limit requires very large data sets, we focus here on the information
transmitted in constant time windows, T = 30 ms, as a function of ∆t. We choose
T = 30ms because that amounts to the delay time with which a chasing ﬂy follows
turns of a leading ﬂy during a chase (Land and Collett, 1974); the end result, that is
the dependence of information transmission on ∆t, was found not to depend critically
on the choice of T .

To quantify noise entropy, the method described above requires that a stimulus
waveform be repeated. Although it is possible in principle to quantify information
transmission based only on one repetition, using many repetitions is easier in practice.
In a sense this mode of stimulation is still removed from the realistic situation in which
stimuli are not repeated at all. Indeed, in our experiments there are hints that the ﬂy
adapts to the stimulus somewhat over the ﬁrst few presentations of the 5 second long
stimulus. The eﬀects of adaptation to dynamic stimuli are certainly interesting (Brenner
et al , 2000, Fairhall et al , 2001), but in the data we present here we skip the ﬁrst

Neural coding of naturalistic motion stimuli

few presentations, and only analyze that part of the experiment in which the ﬂy seems
fully adapted to the ongoing dynamic stimulus. Inspection of the rasters in that phase
shows no obvious trends, so that the ﬂy seems to be close to stationary conditions. In
this regard our information measures are lower bounds, as deviations from stationarity
will increase our estimate of the noise entropy, lowering information estimates.

3. Results

3.1. Operating range for naturalistic motion stimuli

In order to be sure that H1 receives no dominant motion related signals from other
modalities than vision we rotated the ﬂy either in darkness or under a cover that turned
along with the ﬂy. This did not produce discernible motion responses in H1. Strictly
speaking that does not exclude possible modulatory mechanosensory input, which could
be investigated in principle by presenting conﬂicting visual and mechanosensory stimuli.
The possibility seems remote, however, and even if true it would not invalidate our
conclusions about the dependence of H1’s information transmission on parameters of
the visual stimulus.

As a ﬁrst comparison between laboratory and natural conditions we present data
from an experiment in which H1 was excited by one second long episodes of motion
at constant velocity. These were presented at a range of velocities from about 0.28◦/s
to 4500◦/s. Outdoors the ﬂy was placed in a wooded environment and rotated on the
stepper motor. In the laboratory the same ﬂy watched a vertical bar pattern derived
from a one dimensional scan of the natural environment in which the outdoor experiment
was done. This pattern was displayed on a standard Tektronix 608 monitor, with a
rectangular stimulated visual area of 67◦ horizontal by 55◦ vertical. The pattern moved
at the same settings of angular velocity as were used outdoors, but the indoor and
outdoor stimuli diﬀered both in average light level and in stimulated area.

Figure 2 shows the average ﬁring rates obtained from the last half second of each
velocity presentation. At low velocities, up to about 20◦/s, the spike rates for both
conditions are not very diﬀerent, despite the large change in total motion signal present
in the photoreceptor array. Apparently the ﬂy adapts these diﬀerences away (see Brenner
et al , 2000). In both experiments the rate depends roughly logarithmically on velocity
over an appreciable range and this is partly a result of adaptation as well (de Ruyter
van Steveninck et al , 1986). In the laboratory experiment the motion response peaks at
about 100◦/s, whereas in natural conditions the ﬂy encodes velocities monotonically for
an extra order of magnitude, its response peaking in the neighbourhood of 1000◦/s. This
brings H1’s encoding of motion under natural conditions in the range of behaviourally
relevant velocities. A lack of sensitivity to high speeds has been claimed both to be an
essential result of the computational strategy used by the ﬂy, and to be advantageous
in optomotor course control (Warzecha and Egelhaaf, 1998). These conclusions do not
pertain to the conditions in the outdoor experiment, where H1 responds robustly and

Neural coding of naturalistic motion stimuli

reliably to angular velocities of well over 1000◦/s.

3.2. Motion detection throughout the day

Figure 3 shows spike train rasters generated by H1 in three outdoor experiments,
focusing on a short segment that illustrates some qualitative points. Trace (a) shows
the velocity waveform, which was the same in all three cases. The experiments were
performed at noon (b), half an hour before sunset (c), and about half an hour after
sunset (d). Rough estimates of the photon ﬂux in a blowﬂy photoreceptor looking at
zenith are shown beside the panels. In all experiments the ﬂy saw the same scene, with
a spatial distribution of intensities ranging from about 5% to 100% of the zenith value.
The ﬁgure reveals that some aspects of the response are quite reproducible, and
further that particular events in the stimulus can be associated reliably with small
numbers of spikes. More dramatically, the timing precision of the spike trains gradually
decreases going from the noon experiment to the one after sunset. Higher photon rates
imply a more reliable physical input to the visual system. The ﬁgure therefore strongly
suggests that the ﬂy’s visual system utilizes this increased input reliability to compute
and encode motion more accurately when the light intensity increases. This statement
is ecologically relevant, as the conditions of the experiment correspond to naturally
occurring light levels and approximately to the naturally stimulated visual area. To get
a feeling for the spike timing precision in the three conditions we can simply look at the
distribution of timing of the ﬁrst spike generated after a ﬁxed criterion time (for which
we choose t=0.28 s in (b) and (c) and t=0.30 s in (d)). The jitter in the spike timing
across diﬀerent trials has a standard deviation of 0.95 ms in (b), 1.4 ms in (c), and 5.8
ms in (d). The relative timing of spikes can be even more accurate: the interval from
the ﬁrst to the second spike ﬁred after the criterion time is 2.3±0.23 ms in (b), 5.0±0.6
ms in (c), and 16±2.4 ms in (d). Compared to the rapid onsets and oﬀsets of the spike
activity at the higher photon ﬂuxes, the stimulus varies rather smoothly, which means
that the time deﬁnition of spikes with respect to the stimulus can be much better than
might be suggested by the stimulus bandwidth. An example can be seen in the rather
smooth hump in the velocity waveform at about t=0.43 s, which induces on most trials
a well deﬁned response consisting of a sharply deﬁned pair of spikes.

We quantify these impressions using the information theoretic approach described
brieﬂy in section 2.3. The result of this analysis is shown in Fig. 4a-d, for the three
diﬀerent experiments discussed above. Figure 4c clearly shows that the information in a
30 ms window increases both when the light intensity goes up, and when the spikes are
timed with higher accuracy. The increase in information with increasing spike timing
precision is most dramatic for the highest light levels, indicating that coding by ﬁne
spike timing becomes more prominent the better the input signal to noise ratio. A
comparison of ﬁgures 4a (total entropy) and ﬁgure 4b (noise entropy) reveals that the
increase in information content with increasing light levels is primarily due to an increase
in total entropy: The neuron’s vocabulary increases in size as its input becomes better

Neural coding of naturalistic motion stimuli

10

deﬁned. Figure 4d shows that at the two highest light intensities the coding eﬃciency
is of order 0.5 at time resolution ∆t=1 ms, increasing slightly for larger values of ∆t. In
the darkest condition the eﬃciency decreases markedly for all values of time resolution.
The right column of ﬁgure 4 compares experiments in which we took data both
outdoors and in the laboratory. These data are from another ﬂy, but the conditions of the
outdoor experiment were similar to those for the ﬁrst ﬂy at the highest light level. After
the outdoor experiment the ﬂy was taken inside the laboratory, and the same velocity
stimulus as the one used outside was repeated inside. In the laboratory, as before, the
visual stimulus was presented on a Tektronix 608 CRT. Photoreceptors facing the CRT
received about 5 ·104 photons per second at maximum intensity, a value in between the
light intensities seen by the ﬁrst ﬂy in the experiments just before and just after sunset
(grey and black symbols in ﬁgure 4a-d). Two experiments were done indoor, one in which
the picture on the monitor consisted of vertical bars with a contrast pattern measured in
a horizontal scan of the outdoor scene (ﬁlled triangles), the other a high contrast square
wave pattern with contrast=1, and spatial wavelength=12.5◦ (ﬁlled squares). From
ﬁgure 4g we see that the information transmitted by H1 is much lower in the laboratory
experiments than in the outdoor experiment, due to the smaller stimulated area and
the lower light level. Figure 4e shows that the decrease in information, as before, is
mainly due to a lowering of the total entropy. The noise entropy also decreases (ﬁgure
4f), but not enough to compensate. Somewhat surprisingly, the experiment with the
high contrast pattern indoors leads to a slightly higher coding eﬃciency than even the
outdoor experiment.

4. Discussion

Outdoor illumination can easily be a hundred times brighter than anything displayed
on common laboratory equipment, and in the outdoor experiment stimuli extend over
a large fraction of the ﬂy’s full visual ﬁeld rather than being conﬁned to a small ﬂat
monitor. Both eﬀects are relevant for our experiments, as the higher brightness leads
to higher photoreceptor signal to noise ratios (de Ruyter van Steveninck and Laughlin,
1996), and as H1’s receptive ﬁeld covers almost a hemisphere (Krapp and Hengstenberg,
1997). In moving from laboratory to outdoor conditions, both eﬀects increase the signal
to noise ratio of the input available for computation of rigid wide ﬁeld motion from the
photoreceptor array. The question then is whether the ﬂy’s brain uses this improvement
in input signal quality to produce more accurate estimates of visual motion, and/or
increase its operating range of motion detection. Figure 2 shows that the range of
velocities that are encoded increases markedly when the visual input becomes more
reliable.

If the accuracy of information processing is limited by noise sources within the
nervous system, we should observe a plateau, that is, information transmission should
saturate at some deﬁned level of input signal quality. There is some arbitrariness in the
choice of the level of input signal quality, however: In principle we can surpass any degree

Neural coding of naturalistic motion stimuli

11

of accuracy of the physical input signal by simply increasing the light intensity, and at
some point the internal randomness of the brain’s components must become the limiting
factor in information processing. However, statements about the magnitude of internal
versus external noise in sensory information processing are primarily meaningful in the
context of reasonable, physiological levels of input signal quality. Those stimuli that the
animal encounters naturally, taken at the high end of their dynamic range, would meet
this criterion. For the case considered here the dynamic range refers to light intensity,
size of stimulated visual ﬁeld, and dynamics of motion. The data we recorded outdoors
show no sign of saturation in information transmission when the input signal quality
increases. On the contrary, if we compare the rasters of ﬁgure 3b and 3c, we see that
there is a marked improvement in the timing of spikes, even over the highest decade
of light intensity (2 × 105 to 3 × 106 photons/s at zenith per photoreceptor). This
improvement translates into a signiﬁcant gain in information transmission, especially at
ﬁne time resolution, as shown in ﬁgure 4c. Thus, in computing motion from the array of
photoreceptors, the ﬂy’s brain does not suﬀer noticeably from information bottlenecks
imposed by internal noise, under ecologically relevant conditions.

In our outdoor experiments, the information content of the spike train varies
primarily as a result of a varying total entropy (ﬁgure 4a). The noise entropy (ﬁgure
4b) appears to be almost constant as a function of light level. One can distinguish
two diﬀerent ways to increase information transmission through a channel. The ﬁrst
is to encode the same messages more accurately, the second to increase the variety of
messages, keeping the accuracy of each individual message the same. The ﬁrst scheme
implies constant total entropy and decreasing noise entropy, the second an increase in
total entropy at constant noise entropy. Our data suggest that as the visual input
becomes more reliable, the ﬂy chooses to increase the vocabulary of H1 to encode a
wider variety of features of the motion stimulus, keeping precision roughly constant.

Figure legends

Figure 1. Left: Setup used in the outdoor experiments. The ﬂy is in a plastic tube,
head protruding, and immobilized with wax. A small feeding table is made, from which
the ﬂy can drink sugarwater. The part of the setup shown here rotates around the
axis indicated at the bottom, by means of a stepper motor. A silver reference wire
makes electrical contact with the body ﬂuid, while a tungsten microelectrode records
action potentials extracellularly from H1, a wide-ﬁeld motion sensitive neuron in the
ﬂy’s lobula plate. The electrode signals are preampliﬁed by a Burr-Brown INA111
integrated instrumentation ampliﬁer, the output of which is fed through a slip ring
system to a second stage ampliﬁer and ﬁlter and digitized by a National Instruments
PCMCIA data acquisition card in a laptop computer. The part of the setup visible
in the ﬁgure is mounted on a stepper motor which is driven by computer-controlled
laboratory built electronics. Right: Occlusion in the left visual ﬁeld of the ﬂy. The dot
in centre represents the position of the ﬂy. The animal is looking in the direction of
the arrow and has the same orientation as the ﬂy in the setup at left. The thin mesh
bordered by the heavy line represents the excluded part of the visual ﬁeld of the left
eye for a free ﬂying ﬂy (based on Beersma et al. 1977). The heavy mesh represents the
overlap of the left eye’s natural visual ﬁeld with those parts of the setup that rotate
along with the ﬂy, and therefore do not contribute to a motion signal. The total visual
ﬁeld of the left eye is 6.85 sr, or 0.55 · 4π. The overlap depicted by the heavy mesh
subtends about 1.52 sr, or 22% of the visual ﬁeld of the left eye.

Figure 2. A comparison of responses to constant velocity in a typical laboratory
experiment (closed squares), and in an outdoor setting where the ﬂy is rotating (open
circles). Average ﬁring rates were computed over the last 0.5 seconds of a 1 second
constant velocity presentation.

Figure 3. Responses of the H1 neuron to the same motion trace recorded outside
at diﬀerent times of the day. (a) Short segment of the motion trace executed by the
stepper motor with the ﬂy. The full segment of motion lasted 5 seconds, and was
derived from video recordings of natural ﬂy ﬂight during a chase (see Methods) (b)
50 Spike rasters in response to the motion trace in (a), taken at noon. (c) As (b),
but recorded about half an hour before sunset. (d) As (b), but recorded about half
an hour after sunset.

Figure 4. Lefthand column: Information theoretic quantities for the three outdoor
experiments whose rasters are shown in ﬁgure 3. The symbol shadings refer to the
diﬀerent conditions of illumination in the experiments. All ﬁgures refer to a 30 ms
measurement window in which neural ﬁring patterns are deﬁned at time resolutions,
∆t, of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 30 ms, as given by the abscissae. (a): Total entropy of spike
ﬁring patterns. (b): Average noise entropy. (c): Average information transmitted by
ﬁring patterns. (d): Coding eﬃciency, deﬁned as the transmitted information divided
by the total entropy.

Righthand column: The same quantities as plotted in the lefthand column, but
now for an experiment outdoors (open symbols), and two experiments in the laboratory
(closed symbols, see text for further description of conditions). Squares are for a moving
square wave pattern of high contrast (C=1), and spatial wavelength 12.5◦; triangles are
for a moving sample of the natural scene at the location where the outdoor experiments
were done. Both these stimulus patterns were generated on the cathode ray tube in
the laboratory.

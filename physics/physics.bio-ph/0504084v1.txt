Fluctuations in type IV pilus retraction

Abstract

The type IV pilus retraction motor is found in many important bacterial pathogens.
It is the strongest known linear motor protein and is required for bacterial in-
fectivity. We characterize the dynamics of type IV pilus retraction in terms
of a stochastic chemical reaction model. We ﬁnd that a two state model can
describe the experimental force velocity relation and qualitative dependence of
ATP concentration. The results indicate that the dynamics is limited by an
ATP-dependent step at low load and a force-dependent step at high load, and
that at least one step is eﬀectively irreversible in the measured range of forces.
The irreversible nature of the sub-step(s) lead to interesting predictions for
future experiments: We ﬁnd diﬀerent parameterizations with mathematically
identical force velocity relations but diﬀerent ﬂuctuations (diﬀusion constant).
We also ﬁnd a longer elementary step compared to an earlier analysis, which
agrees better with known facts about the structure of the pilus ﬁlament and
energetic considerations. We conclude that more experimental data is needed,
and that further retraction experiments are likely to resolve interesting details
and give valuable insights into the PilT machinery. In light of our ﬁndings, the
ﬂuctuations of the retraction dynamics emerge as a key property to be studied
in future experiments.

Introduction

The type IV pilus (TFP) retraction motor is interesting and important for
several reasons. Not only is it necessary for the infectivity of many human
pathogens (1), it is also the strongest known linear motor protein, making it an
interesting test ground for understanding generation of large forces in nanosys-
tems. The physics of pilus retraction has recently been studied experimentally
(3; 8; 7), and it is of interest for theoretical study, which we present here.

Physical modeling of motor proteins has seen a rapid development recently,
made possible by improved experimental techniques that enable measurement
on the single molecule level.
It is possible to apply general thermodynamic
considerations to construct models which do not require fully detailed knowledge

of the molecular details of the system. This can lead to new insights about the
molecular mechanism, make predictions that can be tested experimentally, and
suggest new experiments.

We will now brieﬂy review the relevant facts known about the PilT system.
After that, we introduce the model with emphasis on the underlying assumptions
and the interpretation of the model parameters. TFP are surface ﬁlaments
crucial for initial adherence of certain gram-negative bacteria to target host cells,
DNA uptake, cell signaling, and bacterial motility. The pili ﬁlaments consist
of thousands of pilin subunits that polymerize to helical ﬁlaments with outer
diameter of about 6 nm, a 4 nm pitch and 5 subunits per turn (1; 2). Bacterial
motility (twitching motility) is propelled by repeated extension and retraction of
TFP, by which the bacterium can pull itself forward on surfaces like glass plates
or target host cells (3). During retraction, the ﬁlament is depolymerized, and
the pilin subunits are stored in the cell membrane (5). TFP are expressed by a
wide range of gram-negative bacteria (1) including pathogens such as Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (3), Myxococcus xanthus (4) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5). The
retraction process is believed to be mediated by a protein called PilT, which
is a hexameric (6) motor protein in the AAA family of ATPases (1). Pilus
retraction in N. gonorrhoeae generates forces well above 100 pN (7; 8), making
PilT the strongest known linear motor protein. The large force combined with
the hexameric structure of PilT indicates that retraction of a single pilin subunit
may involve hydrolysis of several ATP molecules.

The physics of pilus retraction has so far been studied experimentally in
some detail (3; 8; 7). The experimental data on retraction velocity has pre-
viously been analyzed theoretically using a model with one chemical reaction
step with an Arrhenius type force dependence, which describes the retraction
at high loads (7). In this paper, we will extend the analysis to two diﬀerent
reaction steps, which is suﬃcient describe the existing data for loads. We will
also make predictions about ﬂuctuations in the retraction process, which are
experimentally accessible. This turns out to be crucial as we consider models
with constrained load patterns. We ﬁnd two families of parameterizations that
describe the data fairly well, give exactly the same velocity, but predict qualita-
tively diﬀerent ﬂuctuations. The constrained models also give a partial explana-
tion for the surprisingly short elementary step in the one state model: Adding
an extra state to account for behavior a low loads changes the interpretation
of the data for high loads, resulting in a longer elementary step. Nevertheless,
one would like to account for an even longer elementary step, to make the de-
scription compatible with the known structure of the pilus ﬁlament. This work
represents an important improvement in this respect. It also indicates that the
pilus retraction system hides more interesting dynamics, and that ﬂuctuations
are the key property to gain further insights about this remarkable motor.

Mechanochemical step model

Discrete mechanochemical models are well established in the description of mo-
tor proteins, and have been used successfully to describe the motion of proteins
that walk along structural ﬁlaments (9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15). The main idea
is to describe the motion in terms of stochastic transitions between meta-stable
states in the reaction cycle of the protein. The starting point is random walk

between nearest neighbor states on a one-dimensional lattice. Each lattice point
corresponds to a meta-stable state in the reaction that drives the motion.

We consider an unbranched reaction with a period of N steps, in which each
state is connected to two nearest neighbors. We denote state j in period k by
jk, which corresponds to a position x(jk) = x(j0) + kd along the track, where
d is the spatial period of the reaction (the elementary step). The reaction is a
Markov process with non-negative forward and backward transition rates ˆuj and
ˆwj respectively, as illustrated in ﬁgure 1 for the case N = 2. An exact solution
due to Derrida (16) gives analytic expressions for the steady state velocity v
and diﬀusion constant D for arbitrary transition rates and period N (12; 17).

A model of this form can, at least in principle, be derived from a theory of
the microscopic degrees of freedom (18; 19), if we assume that the motor action
consists of fast reactions between meta-stable sub-states, which are wells in a
free energy landscape. Even so, the model does not have to include all actual
reactions; quickly decaying states can be lumped together with slower, rate-
limiting ones (19). An alternative to the above mechanism of a fast “working
step” that produces work is the “power stroke”, in which a fast reaction loads
potential energy to an internal degree of freedom, which in turn does work
through relaxation (20). Work following this approach is under way.

Following Fisher and Kolomeisky (15; 14), we take a mechanochemical step
model as a phenomenological starting point, and assume that the chemical re-
actions obey an Arrhenius law (10). The non-negative transition rates depend
on an opposing load F , parallel to the track, and take the form (10)

ˆuj = uje−F cj/kBT ,

ˆwj = wje+F dj /kBT

(1)

where kBT is Boltzmann’s constant times temperature, ui, wj are force inde-
pendent rate constants, and cj, dj are forward and backward load distribution
lengths. cj, dj can be interpreted as positions of the activation barriers projected
N
along the track.The load lengths are expected to obey
j=1(dj + cj) = d, where
d is the spatial period of the motion (the elementary step), which we will dis-
cuss below. One can identify sub-steps of size (dj + cj) between jk and (j + 1)k
(14; 15).

P

The simple form of the reaction rates and the correspondence between load
lengths and actual distances is not universally valid. It rests on assumptions
that the free energy wells corresponding to the sub-states are narrow and sim-
ilar in shape, and that the force is not too large to make thermal ﬂuctuations
unimportant in the reaction process (18).

In the following, we will consider N = 2. There is not enough experimental
data to ﬁt parameters for higher order models, and an N = 1 model can only

describe the behavior in a limited range of forces (7). Retraction experiments
suggest a process with an ATP-limited step at low loads and a force-limited step
at high loads (8), which suggests that a two-state model is necessary to describe
the full dynamics. The steady state velocity given by (16; 17; 12)

As is evident from the above equations, v and D do not depend on which

to uniquely identify sub-steps from knowledge of v and D in a two state model.

Modeling retraction data

P

n(v(Fn) − vn)2/σ2

We ﬁtted Eqs. (1,2) to retraction data for wild type N. gonorrhoeae at 330 K
from Ref. (7), with a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate. Assuming Gaussian
n (21), where
errors, this amounts to minimizing −2 ln L =
Fn, vn and σn are experimental forces, velocities and error bars respectively,
and L is the (Gaussian) likelihood function. The period d is not an independent
parameter in the velocity, and was included in the transition rates. As seen in
Fig. 2, the data is well described. The best ﬁt parameters of the unrestricted
N = 2 model, which we denote N2, are shown in Tab. 1, along with parameter
sets which are optimal when the parameter space is restricted in diﬀerent ways.
We denote the restricted parameterizations A and B, and also include N1, the
high force analysis of Ref. (7), which we reproduce for reference. Some parame-
ters in N2 are extremely small, and can be put to zero without any signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in velocity, which is how the A parameterizations is constructed. This
does not imply that one reaction is completely irreversible, which would violate
detailed balance (19), but rather that one backward rate is small enough to be
negligible in the ﬁt.1

There is no obvious relation between the load distribution lengths of A and
N1, which is surprising since N1 is a good description of the high force regime.
It is therefore tempting to ask whether the force velocity relation can be equally
well described by other parameterizations, with at least one irreversible step
and only one force-dependent step. The minimal way to do this is to remove
the backward step completely from A. This constrained parameterization, B,
cannot be statistically rejected even at 80% conﬁdence. However, the rate-
limiting step in B is still twice as large in N1, a result which is retained even
if only high forces are considered (not shown). The reason for this diﬀerence is
the presence of a force independent step. To show this, we rewrite the N = 1
velocity in the form of an N = 2 model with two equal consecutive reactions.

1Interestingly, a discrete N = 2 model with one irreversible step can be derived as a limiting

case of certain class of simple ratchet models (17).

For simplicity, we neglect the weak force dependence of the backward rate. With
the notation p(X) for parameter p in parameterization X, we get:

At forces where the numerator is dominating the force dependence, this is similar
to an N = 2 model with one force independent step and twice as long load dis-
tribution length on the other step. The factor 2 in numerator and denominator
shows the fact that the elementary step is also twice as long, if the denominator
is brought to the same form as Eq. (2), with four terms. We conclude that the
plateau in v(F ) at low loads have implications for the interpretation of data at
high loads, and that the earlier estimate of the elementary step in Ref. (7) is
too small by (at least) a factor 2.

The B parameterization has another interesting property. It has exactly the
same force velocity relation as two diﬀerent parameter families, C and D, which
we now describe. To construct C from B, one adds an arbitrary force indepen-
dent backward reaction. To keep the velocity unchanged, the force dependent
forward rate must be modiﬁed, but all other parameters in B are kept.

Here, the constant RC is non-negative but otherwise arbitrary, and we retrieve

backward rate, and modify both forward rates.

RD again deﬁnes a parameter family, and the choice of sign in the lower equation
is irrelevant for v and D.

Using the obtained parameters, we can compute the diﬀusion constant D.
In the context of molecular motors, diﬀusion is commonly analyzed in terms
of the dimensionless randomness parameter r = 2D/vd (15; 14; 11; 13; 23;
24), which is shown in Fig. 2c. The randomness is convenient in this case,
as it is independent of d, which is unknown for the PilT motor. Although
parameterizations B, C and D give equivalent force-velocity relations, they
make diﬀerent predictions for the diﬀusion constant. We see that B and C make
qualitatively diﬀerent predictions than D, and that A is quite close to B at high
forces, but deviating at F < 60 pN. We expect a measurement of the diﬀusion
constant D would discriminate between the diﬀerent parameterizations. N2 is
again indistinguishable from A (not shown).

The velocity dependence on ATP concentration ([ATP]) has been studied
in experiments on ATP depleted bacteria, and two regimes where found (8).
At low loads, the velocity was strongly dependent on [ATP], but at high loads,
the velocity was the same for the depleted strain as for the undepleted strain
(“wild type”). A simple way to include ATP dependence in a mechanochemical
step model is to make one forward rate (‘binding reaction‘) proportional to

[ATP]. Figure 2b shows the velocity relation for the A parameters with the
load independent forward rate reduced by 50%. We see that the diﬀerence
compared to the original A parameters vanishes for high load, in qualitative
agreement with the experimental result (8). Adding the [ATP] dependence to
the other step gives qualitatively diﬀerent dependence (not shown). Also note
that if [ATP] dependence is added to the restricted parameterizations B-D in
this way, they still predict the same velocity for all loads and [ATP].

Conclusion

We interpret pilus retraction data on wild type N. gonorrhoeae in terms of a
mechanochemical model, which is a discrete random walk with steps between
nearest neighbors. Despite its simplicity, a description in these terms contains
interesting information about the free energy landscape of the retraction reac-
tions (15; 14; 18).

We ﬁnd that the experimental data for retraction velocity is well described
for all measured forces by several parameterizations, all of which have one eﬀec-

6

tively force independent step and one irreversible step. The model also captures
the qualitative behavior of varying [ATP], namely that the [ATP] dependence
of velocity is strong at low force and very weak at high force (8). As expected,
the binding reaction is not force dependent, but the unbinding might be.

We ﬁnd several diﬀerent parameterizations that give similar or identical
velocities, but make very diﬀerent predictions for the diﬀusion constant D of
the retraction. Without any assumptions regarding the elementary step d, we
predict the randomness r = 2D/dv as shown in Fig. 2c, which would be of
considerable interest to study experimentally. Such measurements may be able
to distinguish the diﬀerent parameterizations (A, B, C and D) and lead to
additional important insight into the pilus retraction mechanism.

We use a model that can account for the all measured forces, we make pre-
dictions open to experimental test, and we get new result for the elementary
step d: 0.5 nm for parameterization A and 0.2 nm for the B, C and D param-
eters, compared to 0.1 nm for the N = 1 model (7). As we argued above, the
short step may be an artifact of using a model with too few states to describe a
restricted part of the force-velocity curve. Adding another state to account for
the behavior at low loads changes the interpretation of the high load behavior.

Even if we get at least twice as long step as in Ref. (7), it is still not obvious
how our result ﬁts with the known facts about the system. Each pilin subunit
contributes about 0.8 nm to the ﬁlament length (7; 8; 1; 2), hence one would
like to account for at least one pilin subunit in a complete description of a
reaction cycle.
In this light, our work is a great improvement even if there
are still a few ˚Angstr¨om left to account for. One possibility is that a model
with more states could account for the missing length, just like going from
one state to two states did. Another is that the strong forces deform the sub-
states and destroy the correspondence between load lengths and physical lengths
(18). Since the existing data is well described by our model, this question must
probably be settled experimentally. There is also a length associated with the
involved energies and forces: at the maximal measured force, 160 pN, the free
energy gain from hydrolysis of one ATP molecule under physiological conditions
(≈ 80 pN nm (9; 10)) is enough to retract 0.5 nm. The evidence that retraction
is powered by ATP hydrolysis (8) does not imply that it is powered only by
ATP hydrolysis. The above estimate indicates that more energy than that of
one ATP is needed to retract one subunit. Since PilT forms a hexamer, it
may hydrolyze up to six ATP in parallel, which would explain the high force
energetically. Another possibility is that free energy from depolymerization of
the ﬁlament is used in retraction.
It might be possible to resolve details of
for example a second binding event with a model with more states. However,
models with more states have more parameters, so more experimental data is
needed to explore these exciting possibilities.

This work extends previous physical modeling of the PilT system (7) in
several ways. In particular, the ﬂuctuations (randomness parameter) emerge as
a key property for further theoretical and experimental study of the dynamics
of pilus retraction.

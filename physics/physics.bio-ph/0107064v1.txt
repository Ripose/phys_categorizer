Excitons in a Photosynthetic Light-Harvesting System: A Combined Molecular
Dynamics/Quantum Chemistry and Polaron Model Study

(February 2, 2008)

The dynamics of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions in light-harvesting complexes
is studied with a novel approach that combines molecular dynamics simulations with quantum
chemistry calculations and a polaron model analysis. The molecular dynamics simulation of light-
harvesting complexes was performed on an 87,055 atom system comprised of an LH-II complex of
Rhodospirillum molischianum embedded in a lipid bilayer and surrounded with appropriate water
layers. The simulation provided information about the extent and timescales of geometrical defor-
mations of pigment and protein residues at physiological temperatures, revealing also a pathway of
a water molecule into the B800 binding site, as well as increased dimerization within the B850 BChl
ring, as compared to the dimerization found for the crystal structure. For each of the 16 B850 BChls
we performed 400 ab initio quantum chemistry calculations on geometries that emerged from the
molecular dynamical simulations, determining the ﬂuctuations of pigment excitation energies as a
function of time. From the results of these calculations we construct a time-dependent Hamiltonian
of the B850 exciton system from which we determine within linear response theory the absorp-
tion spectrum. Finally, a polaron model is introduced to describe both the excitonic and coupled
phonon degrees of freedom by quantum mechanics. The exciton-phonon coupling that enters into
the polaron model, and the corresponding phonon spectral function are derived from the molecular
dynamics and quantum chemistry simulations. The model predicts that excitons in the B850 bacte-
riochlorophyll ring are delocalized over ﬁve pigments at room temperature. Also, the polaron model
permits the calculation of the absorption spectrum of the B850 excitons from the sole knowledge of
the autocorrelation function of the excitation energies of individual BChls, which is readily available
from the combined molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry simulations. The obtained result is
found to be in good agreement with the experimentally measured absorption spectrum.

I. INTRODUCTION

Life on earth is sustained through photosynthesis. The
initial step of photosynthesis involves absorption of light
by the so-called light-harvesting antennae complexes, and
funneling of the resulting electronic excitation to the pho-
tosynthetic reaction center [1–4]. In case of purple bac-
teria, light-harvesting complexes are ring-shaped aggre-
gates of proteins that contain two types of pigments, bac-
teriochlorophylls (BChls) and carotenoids.

Recent solution of the atomic level structure of the
light-harvesting complex II (LH-II) of two species of pur-
ple bacteria, Rhodopseudomonas (Rps.) acidophila [5]
and Rhodospirillum (Rs.) molischianum [6], has opened
the door to an understanding of the structure-function re-
lationship in these proteins. Fig. 1 shows the structure of
LH-II of Rs. molischianum in its membrane-water envi-
ronment. LH-II is an octamer, consisting of eight α- and
eight β- protein subunits which bind non-covalently the
following pigments: eight BChls that absorb at 800 nm
and are referred to as B800 BChls, 16 BChls that absorb
at 850 nm, and are referred to as B850 BChls, and eight
carotenoids which absorb at 500 nm. The pigment sys-
tem of LH-II is shown in Fig. 2. The diﬀerence in absorp-
tion maxima between various pigments funnels electronic
excitation within LH-II; pigments with higher excitation

1

energy pass on their excitation to the pigments with lower
excitation energy. As a result, energy absorbed by the
carotenoids, or the B800 BChls, is funneled into the B850
ring [7]. The B850 ring, in turn, transfers the electronic
excitation to a BChl ring in another light-harvesting com-
plex, LH-I, which is directly surrounding the photosyn-
thetic reaction center. The B850 ring, thus, serves as a
link in a chain of excitation transfer steps which result
ultimately in excitation of the photosynthetic reaction
center [7].

The B800 and B850 BChls have in common a tetrapy-
rol moiety that includes the electronically excited π-
electron system; they diﬀer only in the length of their
phytyl chain [6]. The diﬀerence in the absorption max-
ima arises through the diﬀerence in their ligation sites.
Protein residues at the ligation site, especially aromatic,
charged or polar ones, as well as hydrogen bonds be-
tween pigment and protein residues can shift the absorp-
tion maxima of pigments [9]. However, the diﬀerence in
absorption maxima is also evoked through excitonic in-
teractions between the B850 BChls [10]. The π-electron
systems of neighboring B850 BChls are in van der Waals
contact [6], giving rise to strong couplings between their
electronic excitations. This coupling leads to coherently
delocalized electronic excitations, so-called excitons [11].
What is intriguing about the light-harvesting com-

FIG. 2. Side view of the arrangement of BChl and
carotenoid pigments in LH-II with the protein components of
LH-II stripped away. BChls are presented as green squares.
Sixteen B850 BChls are arranged in the bottom ring and eight
B800 BChls in the top ring. Eight carotenoids, shown in yel-
low, were identiﬁed in the crystal structure at the positions
shown (produced with the program VMD [8]).

plexes of purple bacteria is their circular symmetry: LH-
II of Rs. molischianum is an octamer; LH-II of Rps. aci-
dophila is a nonamer [5]; electron density projection maps
indicate that LH-I of Rs. rubrum is a hexadecamer [12].
This poses the question whether the circular shape plays
a functional role.
In [7] we have constructed an eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian to describe the excitons formed by the
Qy excitations of B850 BChls. The Hamiltonian was as-
sumed to exhibit a perfect 8-fold symmetry axis for a ring
of 16 B850 BChls. In the case of such ideal symmetry,
stationary states, the excitons, have optical properties
characteristic of the symmetry. The dipole strength is
unequally distributed among the excitonic states. In fact,
two degenerate excitonic states carry almost all of the
dipole strength. This property facilitates overall absorp-
tion, since the two degenerate states each absorb with the
strength of eight BChls. Furthermore, an energy trap is
formed; the lowest exciton state carries very small dipole
strength, making ﬂuorescence negligible. As a result, this
state, when populated through thermal redistribution,
traps eﬀectively the excitation energy. However, this sce-
nario holds only as long as the symmetry is not broken
signiﬁcantly.

Interactions of BChls with its protein environment in
LH-II of Rs. molischianum, together with thermal mo-
tions, give rise to static and dynamic disorder which man-
ifests itself through distortions of the 8-fold symmetry.
The classiﬁcation of disorder is based on the time-scale of
protein thermal motions compared to the characteristic
times of absorption, ﬂuorescence, and excitation transfer.
If the protein motion is slow compared to the latter pro-
cesses, the eﬀect of the environment can be considered as
static; otherwise, the eﬀect is dynamic. The nature of the
disorder (static or dynamic) is reﬂected in the line-shape
functions characterizing the energy dependence of opti-

molecules of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), are

in light-blue. One can recognize two ring-shaped clusters of
BChl molecules (green). A ring of eight (only four visible)
BChls at the top is formed by the B800 BChls; a ring of six-
teen BChls (only partially visible) at the bottom is formed by

cal absorption and emission processes. It is important to
know these functions when studying energy transfer be-
tween two molecules since their overlap determines the
transfer rate.

The disorder in LH-II aﬀects the energy level structure
and optical properties of excitonic states, that in turn in-
ﬂuence absorption, ﬂuorescence and excitation transfer.
To understand the dynamics of LH-II it is necessary to
quantify the extent of disorder. One measure of the ef-
fect of disorder is the exciton delocalization length (see
for example [13, 14]). For a completely symmetric aggre-
gate at temperature T = 0 K, the exciton delocalization
length is equal to the total number of BChls, in the case
of LH-II of Rs. molischianum, sixteen. With increased
disorder the coherence of the delocalized states is lost,
and the excitons become conﬁned to a smaller number of
BChls [14].

Exciton delocalization in light-harvesting complexes
of purple bacteria has been a subject of extensive ex-
perimental study. Non-linear absorption [15], circular
dichroism [16], femtosecond transient absorption [17], ﬂu-
orescence [18], pump-probe [19], photon echo [20] and
single-molecule experiments [21], techniques have been
employed to study exciton delocalization length, result-
ing in vastly diﬀerent estimates which range from delo-
calization over two BChls [22], to delocalization over the
entire ring [15]. One of the obvious explanations for dif-
ferent estimates of exciton delocalization are diﬀerences
in the deﬁnition of observables as well as diﬀerences in
the temperature at which experiments were performed.
It appears desirable to complement the experimental
observations of the eﬀect of disorder on the exciton sys-
tem of light harvesting proteins by simulations. Such
simulations can provide a detailed, atomic level picture
of the disorder and its eﬀect. However, the required simu-
lations are extremely demanding. On the one hand, one
needs to simulate the classical motion of light harvest-
ing proteins in their natural lipid-water environment un-
der periodic boundary conditions (to avoid ﬁnite size ef-
fects) and under the inﬂuence of full electrostatics (dipo-
lar forces play a key role in membrane systems). On the
other hand, one needs to carry out, in combination with
the classical simulations, quantum chemical calculations
that account for the coupling between protein dynamics
and electronic properties of the BChl systems. Fortu-
nately, the necessary calculations have become feasible
recently. Naturally, limitations in regard to short sam-
pling times and still rather crude quantum chemical de-
scriptions still exist. Nevertheless, a description of static
and dynamic disorder based on computer simulations,
rather than on ad hoc assumptions, would constitute a
great step forward in our understanding of the light har-
vesting apparatus in photosynthesis. This is particularly
true since the apparatus is based on aggregates of nu-
merous pigments, the functional properties of which are
sensitive to thermal ﬂuctuations. A model that includes
complete information on the actual disorder and its eﬀect
on the electronic properties provides also an opportunity

to improve the analysis of experimental data.

In this paper we investigate the eﬀect of thermal dis-
order on excitons in LH-II at room temperature. We em-
ploy a combined molecular dynamics/quantum chemistry
approach to establish an eﬀective time-dependent Hamil-
tonian for the Qy excitations of B850 BChls. This Hamil-
tonian is used in a quantum mechanical treatment from
which the spectral characteristics of the B850 BChl sys-
tem results. The description is then recast into a polaron
model that treats both nuclear motion and electronic de-
grees of freedom on an equal (quantum mechanical) foot-
ing. The theory underlying our analysis of spectral prop-
erties is outlined in chapter II; the methods employed for
combined molecular dynamics/quantum chemistry simu-
lations are described in chapter III; results, together with
the theory of the polaron model, are presented and dis-
cussed in chapters IV and V. Conclusions are stated in
chapter VI.

II. THEORY AND COMPUTATION OF
SPECTRAL PROPERTIES

We describe the electronic properties of the B850
BChls in LH-II under the assumption that the rest of LH-
II, i.e., protein, B800 BChls, and lycopenes, play merely
the role of a thermal bath. The total Hamiltonian for
this BChl-bath system can be written

ˆH = ˆHBChl + ˆHBChl−Bath + ˆHBath .

(1)

The individual Hamiltonians in Eq. (1) can be further
decomposed as

ˆHBChl = Tel + Tnuc + Vel−el + Vel−nuc + Vnuc−nuc (2)
ˆHBChl−Bath = Vel−Bath + Vnuc−Bath
(3)
ˆHBath = TBath + VBath−Bath .

(4)

The indices of the quantities introduced in Eqs.(1-4)
are chosen in an obvious manner to deﬁne the partial
Hamiltonians suﬃciently. Due to the large mass dif-
ference of electrons and nuclei, we separate BChl de-
grees of freedom into “light” and “heavy”ones, i.e., elec-
tronic and nuclear. We introduce the following set of
indices; r = (~r1, ~r2,
, ~rNel), for all of the electronic
· · ·
, ~RNnuc),
degrees of freedom of BChl; R = ( ~R1, ~R2,
for all of the nuclear degrees of freedom of BChl; and
Z = ( ~Z1, ~Z2,
, ~ZNBath), for all of the bath degrees of
freedom. Index Z labels bath atoms as a whole, i.e., the
splitting of the bath degrees of freedom into nuclear and
electronic is neglected.

· · ·

· · ·

According to the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approxima-
tion [23] we assume that the electrons move adiabatically
in a potential that depends parametrically on the atomic
coordinates of BChl and bath. If ˆHBChl describes a single
BChl, the above approximation applies well. The energy
gap between ground state and lowest singlet excited state

3

Qy, the relevant states, measures about 1.5 eV, which
is too large for vibrationally induced transitions to oc-
cur, i.e., the BO approximation holds well. However, if
ˆHBChl describes an entire B850 BChl ring (comprised of
16 BChls), energy gaps between 16 excitonic states are
much smaller and vibrations might induce transitions be-
tween these states. Therefore, we will assume that ˆHBChl
describes only one of the B850 BChl, while the remain-
ing B850 BChls will join the bath system. From this
description we will derive the characteristics that enter
into a so-called polaron model which describes vibronic
coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom, treating
both excitons and vibrations quantum mechanically.

Within the framework of the BO approximation we
construct the Schr¨odinger equation for the electronic
wavefunction, which depends parametrically on the nu-
clear coordinates R and coordinates of bath atoms Z [23]

interested in the ground and the Qy electronic state of
BChl. The electronic problem stated in Eqs. (5,6) has
been solved with the quantum chemistry package Gaus-
sian 98 [24], as explained in section III.

The equations of motions of the nuclear and bath de-
grees of freedom are solved in the framework of the BO
approximation,
i.e., neglecting the non-adiabatic cou-
pling [23, 25]

ˆHnuc+Bath(R, Z) = Tnuc + TBath + Vnuc−nuc(R)

Dynamics of the nuclear and bath degrees of freedom
can be described through classical molecular dynamics
simulations. The trajectory of nuclear and bath coordi-
nates (R(tk), Z(tk)) for various simulation times tk can
be generated, as described also in section III. By treat-
ing R(tk) and Z(tk) as parameters, energies of the ground
0(tk), and of the excited Qy state, ǫi
state, ǫi
Qy (tk), will be

Hamiltonian ˆH(t) of
The time-
the BChl
dependence of ˆH(t) = ˆH(R(t), Z(t)) arises through vi-
brational motions of the nuclear and bath degrees of free-
dom. The electronic Hamiltonian is expressed in the ba-
sis comprised of the ground state of the B850 ring

ring.

where ~nj(t) are unit vectors describing the direction of
the transition dipole moments ~dj of the ground state
Qy state transition of the j-th BChl, i.e., ~nj(t) =

~dj(t)
, and it points from N atom of pyrol II to the
|
|
N atom of pyrol IV in BChl j at snapshot t. ~rjk(t) con-
nects the coordinates of Mg atoms of BChl j and BChl
k at time t. C is a constant proportional to the square
of the magnitude of the transition dipole, assumed to be
constant, and is set to 21.12 ˚A3 eV . The latter value

4

is obtained when a computationally determined value
of C = 64.38 ˚A3 eV [7], which corresponds to a tran-
sition dipole moment of 11 D, is rescaled to match the
experimental value 6.3 D [26] of the transition dipole
moment. For simplicity we assume that the coupling
between neighboring (and all other) BChls is given by
Wij (t), even though the short distance between neighbor-
ing BChls does not justify limitation to only the leading
term of a multipole expansion. We note, however, that
the amplitude of calculated variations of Wij (t) is two
orders of magnitude smaller than that for the diagonal
matrix elements ǫi(t) (see results section), and that the
error involved in the treatment will not alter the quali-
tative behavior of the system.

III. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

In this section we will describe methodological details
of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on LH-II as
well as of the quantum chemistry on BChls.

A. Molecular Dynamics Simulation

The simulated system, shown in Fig. 1, consists of
the LH-II protein surrounded by a lipid bilayer and a

7

35 ˚A layer of water molecules. The system has been con-
structed in four steps, (i) - (iv).

Step (i): Using X-PLOR [28] we added hydrogen atoms
to the published structure of an LH-II octamer [6], pdb
entry 1LGH. Hydrogen atoms of BChls and lycopene
were constructed by employing the “add all hydrogens”
command from the molecular editor in QUANTA [29].
The new structure, containing explicitly all hydrogen
atoms, was subjected to a series of minimization steps
using X-PLOR [28].

Step (ii:) The modeled LH-II structure was placed into
an elementary cell that was periodically extended. The
cell had the shape of a hexagonal prism. Accordingly, we
placed LH-II into a hexagonally shaped patch of lipid bi-
layer. We chose for the hexagon a side of length a = 60 ˚A;
the height of the bilayer was about 42 ˚A.

The lipids employed were palmitoyloleoylphosphatidyl-
choline (POPC). Ten lipid molecules were placed within
the central opening of the LH-II (see Fig 2a) and 257
lipids were placed around the protein. The number of
lipids in the center were chosen according to the avail-
able area in the LH-II center and to the surface area of
equilibrated POPC lipids [30]. The chosen number is also
justiﬁed a posteriori since the central opening of LH-II
remained constant in size during the subsequent equili-
bration described below.

Step (iii): Two water layers, with 35 ˚A combined thick-
ness, of the same hexagonal shape as that of the lipid bi-
layer (a = 60 ˚A), were added to both sides of the system,
by removing all water molecule within 2.4 ˚A distance
from heavy atoms of protein or lipids.

Step (iv): Electrostatic forces were calculated using the
Particle-Mesh-Ewald method (PME). To assure neutral-
ity of the system, required by this method, we added 16
Cl− ions to the simulated system, and placed them not
closer than 5 ˚A from the protein residues at positions of
minimal electrostatic energy. However, due to the high
mobility of the ions, the original positions chosen were
largely irrelevant.

Input ﬁles for the MD simulation were prepared with
the program XPLOR [28]. We used the CHARMM22
force ﬁeld [31, 32] to describe protein and lipids. For
water we employed the TIP3 model [33], omitting in-
ternal geometry constraints [34–36]. Ground state par-
tial charges for the geometry minimized structure of
BChl (phytyl tail omitted) were calculated with the pro-
gram JAGUAR [37], employing the ESP method (charge,
dipole, quadrupole and octupole moment being the ESP
constraints) and a 6-31G
basis set. The calculated
∗∗
charges are presented in Table I. We note here that
we used ﬁxed ground state charges for BChls through-
out the simulation. The remaining force ﬁeld parameters
for the BChls were chosen as those presented in [38, 39].
Force ﬁeld parameters for lycopene were assigned with
the program QUANTA [29] by exploiting QUANTA’s
display parameter ﬁle. As pointed out above, the simu-
lated system was ﬁrst subjected to energy minimizations
in XPLOR [28]. Additional minimizations, equilibration

TABLE I. Partial

for geometry optimized
BChl (phytyl tail omitted), calculated with the program
JAGUAR [37], with the ESP method (charge, dipole,
quadrupole and octupole moment being the ESP constraints)
and the 6-31G∗∗ basis set. To hydrogen atoms bonded to the
same carbon we assigned an average charge. Charges for the
phytyl tail were those presented in [38, 39]

and MD simulations were performed using the molecular
dynamics program NAMD, version 2 [40]. We used the
SHAKE constraint for all hydrogen atoms. For the di-
electric constant we chose the value ǫ = 1; the integration
time-step during the equilibration phase of the simulation
was 2 fs. The equilibration was carried out for a time pe-
riod of 2 ns in an NpT ensemble mode with a total of
87,055 atoms per elementary cell, at a pressure of 1 atm
and a temperature of 300 K for periodic boundary con-
ditions, calculating electrostatic interactions in full using
the PME method. The cutoﬀ for Ewald summations was
10 ˚A. Our choice of a 35 ˚A water layer, and a 20 ˚A layer of
lipids between two neighboring LH-II molecules ensures
adequate separation between the proteins. The choice of
a hexagonal unit cell, as compared to a square shaped
unit cell, signiﬁcantly reduced the size of the simulated
system.

After the equilibration phase, we performed two molec-
ular dynamics runs, using a 1 fs integration time-step.
The ﬁrst run was performed for 10 ps, by recording con-
ﬁgurations every 100 fs. The second run was performed
for 800 fs, with snapshots of the trajectory recorded ev-
ery 2 fs. The structures associated with the latter 2 fs
snapshots were used in quantum chemistry calculations

of BChl’s excitation energies. Due to a need to perform
quantum chemistry calculations for all 16 BChls of the
B850 system, and due to the high computational eﬀort
(calculations on four processors of Silicon Graphics Ori-
gin 2000 required for every snapshot one hour computing
time per BChl), we could only perform calculations for
400 snapshots.

B. Quantum Chemistry Calculations

Calculations of the ground and excited state energies
of individual BChls have been performed using the pro-
gram Gaussian 98 [24]. The coordinates and charges of
the bath atoms provided a background charge distribu-
tion. The calculations were performed at the Hartree-
Fock/conﬁguration interaction singles (HF/CIS) level,
with the STO-3G basis set. We used this basis set be-
cause it is computationally the least expensive, and be-
cause our test calculations showed that the more sophis-
ticated 6-31G* basis set resulted in only slightly diﬀer-
ent ﬂuctuations of excitation energies. To further speed
up calculations, we restricted the active space for the
CIS calculations to the ten highest occupied molecular
orbitals and to the ten lowest unoccupied molecular or-
bitals, as suggested in [41].

The use of the ab initio (HF/CIS) method to calcu-
late excitation energies versus semi-empirical, or classical
calculations was discussed by the authors in [41]. Even
though the ab initio method predicted incorrectly the
average excitation energies of BChls (as opposed to the
semi-empirical method), it predicted well the width of the
absorption spectrum, which is determined by the ﬂuctua-
tions of the energy values around the average value. We,
thus, chose to use the ab initio method to determine the
ﬂuctuations, while for the average excitation energy we
used a value of 1.57 eV.

IV. SIMULATED PROTEIN DYNAMICS AND
SPECTRA

Below we will ﬁrst compare the crystal structure of
LH-II of Rs. molischianum [6], used to initiate our simu-
lations, with the structure emerging after 2 ns MD equili-
bration. We will then present the spectral properties pre-
dicted for the B850 system of LH-II under the inﬂuence of
thermal ﬂuctuations as described in combined quantum
chemistry, quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics
calculations.
In the following section, we will cast our
results into a polaron model that describes the vibronic
coupling of the B850 exciton system.

FIG. 3. Orientation of B850 BChls resulting from a snap-
shot of a 10 ps long molecular dynamics simulation. Orien-
tation of the Qy transition dipole moments is indicated by
arrows. Angles and distances between the nearest neighbors
(in degrees and in ˚A), averaged over a 10 ps long simulation,
are given on the outside and on the inside of the ring, respec-
tively. The same numbers are shown in the right-hand side of
the Figure, and compared to the angles and distances of the
crystal structure.

A. Structure of LH-II at room temperature

In order to analyze the geometry of LH-II equilibrated
in our MD simulations we performed a 10 ps MD simula-
tion run. This permits us to compare the crystallograph-
ically determined structure of LH-II of Rs. molischianum
as reported in [6] with the simulated structure.

1. B850 BChls

The Mg–Mg distances between neighboring B850
BChls, averaged over the 10 ps simulation, are shown
in Fig. 3. The average Mg–Mg distances within and be-
tween αβ-heterodimers are 9.8 ˚A and 8.8 ˚A, respectively.
They diﬀer from the corresponding averages in the crystal
structure [6], which are 9.2 ˚A within an αβ-heterodimer
and 8.9 ˚A between heterodimers. Average angles between
neighboring BChls are also shown in Figure 3. The aver-
age angles between neighboring BChls are 160.9◦ within a
αβ-heterodimer, and 143.5◦ between heterodimers. The
corresponding angles in the crystal structure are 167.5◦
and 147.5◦, respectively [6].

We note here that the average angles and distances re-
sult from a 10 ps sampling. The possibility that, for a
10 ps long sampling, a structural inhomogeneity arises
can be inferred from the fact that one of the BChls Mg–
Mg inter-heterodimer distance was found to be much
larger (10.4 ˚A) than the average distance (8.6 ˚A). This
structural inhomogeneity will likely disappear for longer
sampling times.

2. B800 BChls

The crystal structure of LH-II of Rs. molischianum
revealed an unusual ligation of the B800 BChls [6]. In
variance with the customary ligation of BChl’s central
Mg atom to a His residue (as found for the B850 BChls),
the Mg atom of B800 BChls is coordinated to the Oδ1
atom of an Asp residue. In addition, an H2O molecule
is found in the vicinity of the ligation site. The initial,
minimized structure of LH-II embedded into a lipid-water
environment did not contain any water molecules within
the B800 binding pocket. During the course of the equili-
bration, a water molecule diﬀused into the B800 binding
pocket for seven out of eight of the B800 BChls. In Fig. 4
we show a diﬀusion pathway of a water molecule into the
binding site of one of the B800 BChls, recorded over the
ﬁrst 440 ps of the equilibration run. Representative dis-
tances within the binding pocket, averaged over the 10 ps
long simulation, are shown in Fig. 4: 2.72 ˚A (O atom of
H2O to Oδ1 atom of Asp6), 3.76 ˚A (O atom of H2O to
Mg atom of BChl), 3.16 ˚A (carbonyl O2 atom of BChl to
O atom of H2O), 2.00 ˚A (Mg atom of BChl to Oδ1 atom
of Asp6). The respective distances determined for the
crystal structure of LH-II are 2.74 ˚A, 4.24 ˚A, 3.10 ˚A and
2.45 ˚A, respectively [6].

B. Time-series analysis of simulation data

The time series analysis presented in this section is
based on an 800 fs long MD simulation. We recorded
the nuclear (R(tk)) and bath (Z(tk)) coordinates every
2 fs, and generated a total of 400 snapshots. Based on
R(tk), and Z(tk), we performed a total of 16
400 quan-
tum chemistry calculations, resulting in excitation ener-
gies ǫi(tk), i = 1, ..., 16, for each snapshot k. Based on
R(tk) and Z(tk), we also calculated Wi,j (tk) according to
Eq. (14). Combining ǫi(tk) and Wi,j (tk) we constructed
the time-dependent exciton Hamiltonian (13).

×

1. Exciton Hamiltonian

Fluctuations of two representative elements of Hamil-
tonian matrix (13) are presented in Fig. 5. The ﬂuctu-
ations of the largest oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements, i.e.,
couplings between neighboring BChls, are two orders of
magnitude smaller than the ﬂuctuations of diagonal ma-
trix elements. The ﬂuctuations of couplings between non-
neighboring BChls are at least another order of magni-
tude smaller than those of the nearest neighbors. This
suggests that oﬀ-diagonal disorder is negligible compared
to the diagonal disorder.

Simple visual inspection of the time-dependence of ǫ(t)
in Fig. 5, reveals a prominent oscillatory component of
about 20 fs. Indeed, the power spectrum of ǫi(t) (aver-
aged over all 16 BChls) deﬁned as

FIG. 4. Binding pocket for B800 BChl and surrounding

Snapshots of the water molecule at times t = 0 (1), t = 230 ps
(2), t = 360 ps (3), t = 362 ps (4) are represented. Distances,
averaged over a 10 ps simulation, of the O atom of the water
molecule, in position (4), with key protein and BChl atoms
are given.

and shown in Fig. 6, displays strong components in the
range between 0.2 eV and 0.22 eV, corresponding to the
oscillations with a period of 20.6 fs and 19.1 fs, respec-
tively. These modes most likely originate from a C=O or
a methine bridge stretching vibration. We note that the
autocorrelation function of Qy excitation energy of BChl
in methanol also displays a prominent vibrational mode
of about 18 fs period [41].

Fig. 6 reveals further vibrational modes. While the
B850a and B850b BChls have some common modes
(0.198 eV, 0.141 eV, 0.077 eV), some other modes peak
at slightly diﬀerent energies; 0.218 eV, 0.21 eV, 0.182 eV,
0.174 eV, 0.045 eV for B850a as compared to 0.214 eV,
0.178 eV, 0.040 eV for B850b. These diﬀerences most
likely stem from the diﬀerence in the protein environ-
ment seen by B850a and B850b.

BChls, i = 2, 4, . . . , 16 (dashed line).

B850b BChls (data not shown) reveal rather large values
for the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), of about
0.21 eV for B850a and 0.25 eV for B850b. Furthermore,
the lineshape in Fig. 9 reveals a non-Gaussian distribu-
tion. The same non-Gaussian distribution of excitation
energies was observed in [41]. The reason for such a dis-
tribution might be strong coupling to the high-frequency
modes.

The Hamiltonian (13) was diagonalized for each snap-
shot tk of the simulation, assuming that it is constant in
the interval [tk, tk+1]. Fluctuations of the excitonic en-
ergies that result from the diagonalization are shown in
Fig. 7. The Figure also shows energies of the 16 excitonic
states averaged over the 800 fs long run, versus a corre-
sponding average of the dipole strength. Dipole strengths
are given in units of individual BChl dipole strength (1
Sy). As can be inferred from Fig. 7, only the lowest ﬁve
excitonic levels have dipole strengths larger than 1. This
suggests that in a thermally disordered exciton system
the spectral maximum experiences a red-shift relative to
the absorption maximum of an individual BChl.

For comparison we show excitonic energies and dipole
strengths for the Hamiltonian that corresponds to the
perfect symmetric crystallographic structure. Energetic
degeneracies of the exciton states are lifted in the ﬂuctu-
ating case and excitonic energies spread due to disorder.
On the other hand, dipole strength, which is mostly con-
tained in two degenerate excitonic levels in the symmetric
case, is distributed more equally among the exciton states
in case of the disordered system. The dipole forbidden
nature of the lowest exciton state of the symmetric case
is lifted in the disordered case.

2. Absorption spectrum

The absorption coeﬃcient α(ω) of

the excitoni-
cally coupled B850 BChls was calculated by employing
Eqs. (17,18,56). The Hamiltonian ˆH(tk) was assumed
tk = 0.5 fs,
to be constant in the time interval tk+1 −
and the evolution operators U (tk+1, tk) in Eq. (17) were
determined accordingly. Since molecular dynamics tra-
jectories were recorded only every 2 fs we generated ad-
ditional data points for the Hamiltonian by linear inter-
polation. Ensemble averaging was achieved by dividing
the total simulation time of 800 fs into 40 fs long time
intervals, which resulted in a total of 20 samples of 40 fs
length. The integrand in Eq. (56) is shown in Fig. 8.
The fast ﬂuctuation of the integrand required a choice of
0.5 fs for the time discretization. The resulting normal-
ized spectrum is also shown in Fig. 8.

The calculated exciton absorption spectrum is com-
pared in Fig. 8 to the experimentally measured spectrum.
The calculated spectrum has a FWHM of about 0.138 eV,
which is considerably larger than the FWHM of 0.05 eV
for the experimental spectrum. Below we will discuss
possible reasons for this discrepancy.

We have also determined the absorption spectrum of
individual BChls, according to Eq. (59). The spectrum
was obtained from a sample of 320 (800
16/40) MD
runs of 40 fs length. The integration time-step was again
0.5 fs. The FWHM of the individual BChl absorption
spectrum is about 0.125 eV, and its maximum is blue
shifted with respect to the maximum of the exciton ab-
sorption spectrum. This shift is in agreement with the
above mentioned transfer of dipole strength into low en-
ergy exciton states (see Fig. 7).

×

Our test calculations indicate that for both the individ-
ual BChl and exciton case, the additional peaks on both
sides of the main absorption peak are unphysical and are

most likely a consequence of insuﬃcient sampling.

The exciton spectrum is slightly broader than the spec-
trum of individual BChls, apparently indicating the lack
of an exchange narrowing of the absorption spectrum.
Exchange narrowing is well known in J-aggregates with
static disorder [43], and is caused by excitonic interac-
tions within an aggregate, i.e., the excitation experiences
more than one realization of disorder, and, thus, eﬀective
disorder is an average over those realization. For purely
statically disordered LH-II aggregates, the exchange nar-
rowing factor was found to be about 2.8 [7], in agreement
with the theoretical value √N , where N characterizes
the N-fold symmetry of the aggregate, i.e., in the present
case N = 8. Exchange narrowing was also shown to occur
for dynamically disordered aggregates. For a particular
model, the authors in [44] have derived an expression
for the narrowing factor which depends on the size of
the aggregate, correlation time of the ﬂuctuation tc, as
well as the strength of the excitonic coupling J. For the
values characteristic for our simulation, tc
20 fs, and
300 cm−1, the exchange narrowing factor is about
J
unity. Thus, provided that the model of Ref. [44] is ap-
plicable to our simulation, this result may explain the
absence of exchange narrowing of our exciton absorption
spectrum.

3. Discussion of the results of the simulations

For about 30 % of the MD geometries the quantum
chemistry calculations predicted a slight degree of mixing
between the Qy and Qx states. If this mixing was only an
artifact of quantum chemistry calculations, it would have

resulted in the Qy energy being predicted too low, and
ﬂuctuation of the excitation energy to be unrealistically
large. An immediate test of the validity of the quantum
chemistry calculations is provided by a comparison of the
predicted mean energy gap of 0.45 eV between the Qy
and Qx states with the corresponding experimental value.
Taking into account the additional shift due to excitonic
interactions in the Qy band, of about 0.13 eV, as pre-
dicted by our calculations, it appears that the quantum
chemistry calculations account correctly for the experi-
mentally measured 0.6 eV of the mean energy gap. More
reﬁned quantum chemistry calculations are necessary to
determine if the Qy

Qx mixing is indeed genuine.

Next we discuss the choice of nearest-neighbor cou-
plings. Various estimates of these couplings have been
reported in the literature; for LH-II of Rs. molischianum:
806 cm−1 and 377 cm−1 (semiempirical INDO/CIS cal-
culations/eﬀective Hamiltonian calculations [7, 45]), 408
cm−1 and 366 cm−1 (collective electronic oscillator ap-
proach [46]); for LH-II of Rps. sphaeroides: 300 cm−1
and 233 cm−1 (circular dichroism studies [47]); for LH-
II of Rps. acidophila: 238 cm−1 and 213 cm−1 [48], 320
cm−1 and 255 cm−1 [49] (CIS Gaussian 94 calculations),
394 cm−1 and 317 cm−1 (QCFF/PI calculation [50]), 622

−

12

cm−1 and 562 cm−1 (ZINDO/S method [51]). The aver-
age values of couplings used in this paper are 364 cm−1
and 305 cm−1. If larger values were used, as might have
been suggested from some of the above mentioned esti-
mates, a narrower absorption spectrum would have been
predicted, due to an increase in the exchange narrowing
factor.

To reduce computational cost of our simulation, we em-
ployed the dipole-dipole approximation to describe vari-
ations of the nearest neighbor couplings as a function
of time. It is well known that this approximation does
not hold in the case when center-to-center distances be-
tween pigments are smaller than the size of the pigments
themselves. However, we ﬁnd that the ﬂuctuations of
the amplitude of oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements is negligi-
ble compared to the ﬂuctuations of the diagonal matrix
elements, and we expect that this would still hold if the
proper coupling between the neighboring pigments was
determined.

V. ANALYSIS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE
POLARON MODEL

In order to describe the inﬂuence of dynamical disor-
der (thermal ﬂuctuations) on the electronic excitations of
the B850 BChls, we will employ now a model that focuses
on the eﬀect of the strongest ﬂuctuations in the exciton
Hamiltonian (13), the variation of the site energies ǫj(t).
These variations are foremost due to the coupling of the
high-frequency vibrations to Qy excitations in BChl (see
Fig. 6).
Initially, we will model this coupling through
a single harmonic oscillator mode ω0, that is coupled to
each of the local BChl excitations and, thereby, to the ex-
citon system. Both the selected vibrational mode and the
exciton system will be described quantum mechanically,
replacing the time dependence of the Hamiltonian (13)
by a time-independent Hamiltonian that includes the se-
lected vibrational mode and the exciton system. We as-
sume that the electronic excitations of the B850 BChls
form a linear system of coupled two-level systems, which
interact at each site with dispersionless Einstein phonons
of energy ¯hω0. To simplify our notation, we will assume
units with ¯h = 1. The corresponding model Hamilto-
nian, the so-called Holstein Hamiltonian [52], reads

represents the selected vibrations of the BChls where b†

and bi denote the familiar harmonic oscillator creation
and annihilation operators. Hint describes the interac-
tion between excitons and phonons, scaled by the dimen-
sionless coupling constant g.

−

The stationary states corresponding to the Hamilto-
nian (60) are excitons “dressed” with a phonon cloud and
are referred to as polarons. Accordingly, the suggested
description is called the polaron model. In what follows
we shall restrict ourself only to the “symmetric case”, i.e.,
we assume ǫi = ǫ0 for all sites, and we set Vij =
V δj,i±1,
where V is the nearest neighbor interaction energy. This
choice of the Hamiltonian is motivated by the results of
our simulations, which suggest that the exciton dynamics
is determined by the size- and time-scales of the thermal
ﬂuctuations of the excitation energies, ǫi, of individual
BChls. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5, the magnitude of the
ﬂuctuations of ǫi is two orders of magnitude larger than
the one corresponding to the nearest neighbor coupling
energies, Vi,i±1, and at least three orders of magnitude
larger than the one corresponding to the coupling ener-
gies between non-neighboring BChls (Vij , with j
1).
Furthermore, according to Fig. 5, the period of oscilla-
tion of ǫi(t) (i = 1, . . . , 16) of a single BChl is about 20 fs,
which corresponds to a high frequency intramolecular vi-
bronic mode of energy ω0 = 1, 670 cm−1 = 207 meV
In the exciton Hamiltonian we set
(see also Fig. 6).
ǫi = ǫ0 = 1.57 eV, and V = 350.9 cm−1 = 43.5 meV, cor-
responding to an exciton bandwidth of 4V = 174 meV.

= i

±

The eﬀect of static disorder can be incorporated into
this model by deﬁning ǫi and Vij as random variables
drawn from a suitably chosen distribution, which best
characterizes the nature of the disorder.
In this case,
in calculating diﬀerent physical observables, besides the
usual thermal average, a second, conﬁguration average
needs to be performed.

≫

The stationary states of the Holstein polaron Hamilto-
nian (60) cannot be described analytically and one needs
a suitable approximation. In general, well controlled per-
turbative approximations are available only in the weak
1; for a more precise criteria see below) and strong
(g
(g
1) coupling limits. Besides conventional perturba-
tion theory, the cumulant expansion method provides a
convenient alternative for solving the polaron problem.
The advantage of this method is that it provides reliable
results even for arbitrary values of the coupling constant
g [53]. By using our computer simulation results, we will
estimate the value of g and show that our system falls
into the weak exciton-phonon coupling regime. Then, we
will use both perturbation theory and the cumulant ex-
pansion method to investigate within the framework of
the polaron model the eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuations on
the exciton bandwidth, coherence size, and absorption
line-shape.

A. Evaluation of coupling constant g

The coupling constant g can be evaluated by estimat-
ing the eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuations on the electronic ex-
citations of individual BChls. This corresponds to setting
Vij = 0 in (60). In fact, in calculating excitation energies
ǫi(t) in our simulations we had not accounted for exci-
tonic coupling. As a result, we can use ǫi(t), i = 1, . . . , M

of the corresponding moments
The coupling constant g can be determined by ﬁtting
to these data the prediction from Hamiltonian (60), for
Vij = 0. The statistics for ρ(ǫ) can be improved by av-
eraging over all sixteen B850 BChls. Since we assume
that all sites are equivalent, we can restrict ourself to the
model Hamiltonian

In general, when the coupling Vij between excitons can-
not be neglected, the higher order cumulants Φm do not
vanish, and the Green’s function G(t) cannot be calcu-
lated exactly. Nevertheless, even in this case, the cumu-
lant expansion method, as illustrated above in deriving
the well known result (77), can be conveniently applied
to calculate perturbatively, in a systematic way, both the
Green’s function and the corresponding absorption spec-
trum (see below) to any desired degree of accuracy.

The calculated DOS (normalized to unity) is an in-
ﬁnite sum of Dirac-delta functions at energies ǫℓ, with
weights ρℓ. As shown in Fig. 9, for a proper choice of

which represents a 60% reduction with respect to the un-
perturbed bandwidth 4V . Thus the eﬀect of the high fre-
quency phonons is to reduce the exciton energy band, a
situation commonly encountered in other weak coupling
polaron models in which the phonons tend to enhance the
quasiparticle mass, which is translated into a reduction
of the width of the corresponding energy band [53, 54].
However, it is known that static disorder (or coupling
to low frequency phonons) has precisely the opposite ef-
fect of increasing the exciton bandwidth in BChl aggre-
gates. The fact that in our MD simulations we observe
an increase instead of a decrease of the renormalized ex-
citon bandwidth is most likely due to the fact that in
our simpliﬁed polaron model the eﬀect of static disorder
is entirely neglected, while in the MD simulations this is
implicitly included.

C. Polaron coherence length

Next, we determine the eﬀect of the phonons on the
coherence length Lρ of the excitons in the BChl ring, by
using our polaron model. At zero temperature, the exci-
tons in the coupled BChl aggregate are completely delo-
calized, and Lρ should coincide with the system size M .
In general, ﬁnite temperature and any kind of disorder
will reduce the coherence length of the exciton. There is

≡

In the absence of the exciton-phonon coupling, at room
temperature, by setting in the above equations Ck(j) =
exp(ikj)/√M and Ek
2V cos(k), one obtains
ǫk =
−
6.4, which represents a dramatic decrease with
Lρ0 ≈
respect to the corresponding zero temperature value of
16. For weak exciton-phonon coupling, the eﬀect of the
phonons on Lρ can be taken into account via perturba-
tion theory. By employing Eqs. (82,83) in the density
matrix (86), Eq. (85) yields Lρ
5.4. As expected, the
phonons, which act as scatterers for the excitons, reduce
the coherence size of the latter.

≈

As it can be inferred from Fig. 10, the localization of
the exciton is due primarily to thermal averaging and to
a lesser extent to dynamic disorder. This conclusion is in
agreement with previous studies [14].

D. Absorption spectrum for single Einstein phonon

Finally, we discuss the eﬀect of the phonons on the
absorption spectrum of the excitons. The fundamental
absorption spectrum I(ω) (line shape function) is deﬁned
as [cf. Eq. (59)]

If one neglects the coupling between the individual exci-
tations (case corresponding to light absorption by indi-
vidual BChls), by setting V = 0, Eq. (95) yields the same
expression as (73). Note that in this case, since ǫk = ǫ0
is k independent, we have F (τ ) = 1, and similarly to the
calculation of the Green’s function (74), it can be shown
that Wm(t) = [W1(t)]m/m!, for m > 2. As a result,
all the corresponding higher order cumulants Φm vanish,
i.e., Φ(t) = Φ1(t), and the exact expression of the line-
shape function I0(ω) for individual BChls assumes the
familiar form [53, 54]

where ρℓ and ωℓ are given by Eqs. (77b), and (77c),
respectively. In other words, the absorption line-shape
function of an exciton in the phonon ﬁeld is given by the

imaginary part of the exciton Green’s function, which is
proportional to the density of states [54].

In general, I(ω) cannot be calculated exactly. How-
ever, even for arbitrary values of the exciton-phonon cou-
pling constant g, the cumulant approximation Φk(t)
≈
Φ1(t) can be used safely to evaluate the generating func-
tion f (t) and the corresponding line shape function I(ω).
We have

spectral function evaluated from the energy gap ﬂuctua-
tions δǫ(t). Likewise, here we can determine J(ω) from
the ﬂuctuations of the excitation energies δǫ(t) calculated
for individual BChls. The latter quantity can be obtained
from the combined MD/quantum chemistry simulation
carried out in this study.

Indeed, the Hamiltonian for an individual BChl inter-

acting with a phonon bath can be written

and the corresponding line shape function is given by

to a single Einstein phonon ω0 leads to a stick absorp-
tion spectrum, i.e., a series of Dirac delta functions with
diﬀerent weights.

E. Absorption spectrum for distribution of phonons

In order to calculate, in the framework of the polaron
model, the broadening of the absorption spectrum, and
to compare it with the corresponding experimental result
[see Fig. 8], one needs to include the coupling of the ex-
citons to the quasi-continuous distribution of the rest of
the phonons. Formally, this can be achieved by replacing

Once the actual form of J(ω) is known, I(ω) can be cal-

Apparently, the determination of J(ω) requires the
seemingly unattainable knowledge of the energies ωα of
all phonons, together with their corresponding coupling
constants gα. However, the same problem posed itself
in the framework of the spin-boson model description of
the coupling between protein motion and electron trans-
fer processes [56], and could be solved then through a

This result applies to the general case when the system
has several optically active levels, characterized by diﬀer-
ent transition dipole moments dk. In both cases consid-
ered by us, i.e., individual BChls and the fully symmetric
B850 system (i.e., a circular aggregate of 16 BChls with
excitonic coupling, having 8-fold symmetry, and transi-
tion dipole moments oriented in the plane of the ring of
BChls), there is in fact only one optically active level and,
therefore, in Eq. (112a) the summation over k, as well as
the transition dipole moment can be both dropped. For
1.6 eV, while for
an individual BChl we take ǫk
the B850 system the optically active doubly degenerate
level is ǫk
2V cos(π/8) = 1.52 eV. In this
case, the line shape function assumes the simpler form

J(ω) indicates a strong coupling of the system to an in-

J(ω) has signiﬁcant contributions over the entire range
of phonon energies 0 < ω <
0.22 eV and, therefore, we
∼
expect that all, i.e., low, intermediate and high frequency
phonons will contribute to the broadening of the line
shape function I(ω).

By assuming that the coupling of BChl molecules to
phonons (intramolecular vibrations, vibrations of the
protein matrix and solvent molecules) is independent
of their excitonic coupling, we may conclude that J(ω)
given by Eq. (107), describes equally well both individ-
ual BChls and excitonic aggregates of BChls. The only
diﬀerence between the corresponding absorption spectra
comes from the “excitonic” factor Fk(t) in Eq. (97).

and one can easily see that I0(ω) coincides (up to an
irrelevant normalization factor) with the cumulant ap-
proximation of the line shape function I(ω), Eq. (59),
derived and employed in our computer simulation study.
Therefore, it comes to no surprise that in Fig. 12a the
plots of the normalized [with max
= 1] line shape
functions I0(ω) and I(ω) completely overlap in the peak
region. The diﬀerence between the curves away from the
central peak is most likely due to poor statistics and nu-
merical artifacts introduced by the FFT evaluation of the
integrals for the time series analysis result (59). The peak
of the absorption spectrum is located at ǫ0 = 1.6 eV and
the corresponding FWHM is 125 meV.

{

However, the actual line shape function IBChl(ω), as
given by Eq. (113a), include a non-vanishing Φ′′
0(t). The
corresponding result is also plotted in Fig. 12a. As one
can see, the contribution of Φ′′
0(t) redshifts the peak of
IBChl(ω) to 1.53 eV, and renders IBChl(ω) asymmetric
with a somewhat larger FWHM of 154 meV. As illus-
trated in Fig. 12b, IBChl(ω) matches the corresponding
DOS ρ(ω) [see Eq. (77a) and Fig. 9]. This is not surpris-
ing since, as we have already mentioned, for a two level
system which is linearly coupled to a phonon bath, both
the DOS and the absorption spectrum are proportional
to the imaginary part of the corresponding Green’s func-
tion [53, 54]. The line shape function (59) of individual
BChls derived within the theoretical framework of Sec. II
does not account for the imaginary part of the cumulant
Φ0(t) which suggests that the time development operator
U (t, t0) [Eq. (20)] is not totally adequate for calculating
the absorption coeﬃcient. The situation seems to be sim-
ilar to the commonly used stochastic models in modeling
the absorption spectrum of excitonic systems coupled to
a heat bath with a ﬁnite time scale [58]. In this case as
well, the autocorrelation function of the stochastic en-
ergy gap ﬂuctuations is assumed to be real (i.e., Φ′′(t) is
neglected), and as a result the model violates the ﬂuctu-
ation dissipation theorem, and yields no Stoke shift [58].
This discrepancy is due to the fact that, unlike in the case
of the polaron model, the system-heat bath interaction
is not incorporated in a consistent manner.

C

Within the framework of the polaron model, the ab-
sorption spectrum IB850(ω) of the excitonically cou-
pled B850 BChls can be calculated numerically by using
Eqs. (112b,111,110b,107,94). The needed input quanti-
ties are: T = 300 K,
(t), and ǫk = ǫ±1 = 1.52 eV; these
are derived from our simulations and there are no free
parameters in the above mentioned equations. The com-
puted IB850(ω) is shown in Fig. 13, along with the corre-
sponding spectrum IT SA(ω) obtained through time series
analysis, [c.f. Eqs. (56,57)], and the corresponding exper-
imental result Iexp(ω) [42]. The peak of IB850 is located
at 1.46 eV (
849 nm), and coincides with the position
of the other two spectra. IB850(ω) (FWHM=88 meV) is
somewhat broader than Iexp(ω) (FWHM=58 meV), but
is narrower than IT SA(ω) (FWHM=138 meV). The eﬀect
of exchange narrowing due to the excitonic coupling be-
tween B850 BChls is manifest: FWHM is reduced from

154 meV (Fig. 13) to 88 meV (Fig. 12a), which represents
a reduction in the width of the line shape function by a
factor of 1.75. This exchange narrowing is accounted for
by the factor Fk(t) in Eq. (97); since
1, this
factor reduces the value of the cumulant Φk(t), which
leads to a narrowing of the line shape function [recall
that Φk = 0 result in a Dirac-delta function type I(ω)].
In contrast to the commonly used stochastic models [58]
for describing the absorption spectrum of molecular ag-
gregates, our polaron model does not postulate the form
of the autocorrelation function
(t), but rather uses this
function as an input, derived from computer simulations
or from experiment. In this regard, our polaron model
provides a more realistic approach for evaluating optical
properties of molecular aggregates in general, and the
B850 excitons in particular. Indeed, a generic autocor-
relation function
λt), assumed by most
stochastic models, would represent a gross oversimpliﬁca-
(t) as inferred from
tion of the complicated structure of
our computer simulations (see Fig. 11a). It is clear that
this autocorrelation function cannot be modeled by either
a single or a sum of several exponentially decaying func-
tions, in spite of the fact that by a proper choice of the
values of the mean square ﬂuctuations of the energy gap,
∆2, and of the inverse relaxation time, λ, the stochastic
model can yield an almost perfect ﬁt to the experimental
spectrum. For example, by assuming that in our case the
broadening of the line shape function is due to coupling to
phonons with clearly separated high and low frequency
components, it can be shown that the real part of the
cumulant is approximately Φ′(t)
ℓ t2/2 + Γht, where
ℓ (h) refers to the low (high) frequency component and
h/λh. (The imaginary part of the cumulant Φ′′(t)
Γh = ∆2
is assumed to aﬀect only the shift of the absorption spec-

trum, but not its broadening.) The ﬁrst (second) term in
Φ′(t) represents the short (long) time approximation of
the cumulant brought about by the low (high) frequency
phonons. The corresponding line shape function has a
Voigt proﬁle [58], i.e., is a convolution of a Gaussian and
Lorentzian due to low and high frequency phonons, re-
spectively. For ∆s = 25 meV and Γℓ = 7 meV, one can
obtain an almost perfect ﬁt to the experimental B850
absorption spectrum. However, in spite of this apparent
agreement with experiment, neither these numerical val-
ues nor the clear separation in the phonon spectral den-
sity is justiﬁed in view of our computer simulation results,
and as such this kind of analysis should be avoided. In
fact, as it can be inferred from the plot of J(ω) shown in
Fig. 11b, all phonon frequencies up to 0.24 eV contribute
to the cumulant Φ(t) and, therefore, to the absorption
spectrum I(ω). Thus, unlike stochastic models which
employ ﬁtting parameters to account for the broaden-
ing of the experimental absorption spectra, our polaron
model incorporates dynamic disorder directly through
the phonon spectral function J(ω) obtained from com-
bined MD/quantum chemistry calculations, i.e., without
any ad hoc assumptions and ﬁtting parameters.

Further tests of our polaron model based on the calcu-
lation of other optical properties of the system, such as
the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum, are in preparation.

VI. DISCUSSION

This paper presents a novel approach to the study
of excitons in light-harvesting complexes that combines
molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry calculations
with time-dependent eﬀective Hamiltonian as well as po-
laron model type of analyses.

The molecular dynamics approach allowed us to ob-
serve, at the atomic level, the dynamics of BChl motions
and gain insight into the extent and timescales of geo-
metrical deformations of pigment and protein residues at
physiological temperatures. A comparison of the average
distances and angles between the B850 BChls to those
found in the crystal structure reveals an increased dimer-
ization within the B850 ring, as compared to the crys-
tal structure. We observed diﬀusion of a water molecule
into the B800 BChl binding site for seven out of eight
B800 BChls. The average location of this water molecule
agrees well with the crystal structure location. Future
quantum chemistry calculations will determine whether
this molecule plays a functional role. In this respect it is
interesting to note that the recently published structure
of the cyanobacterial photosystem I at 2.5 ˚Aresolution re-
vealed also ligations of Chla Mg ions involving side groups
other than His, and, in particular, water [59].

The time series analysis theory, based on the combined
MD/QC calculations resulted in an absorption spectrum
that is about a factor of two wider than the experimen-
tal spectrum. One of the reasons for this discrepancy

21

might be improper treatment, and subsequently an over-
estimate, of the contribution of high-frequency modes
within the framework of our combined MD/QC calcu-
lations. We also note that the time series analysis ne-
glects some important quantum eﬀects which may cause
the discrepancy between the computed and the experi-
mental results. These quantum eﬀects are accounted for
by the polaron model. The amplitude of ﬂuctuations of
the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements, i.e., couplings between
BChls, was found to be at least two orders of magnitude
smaller than the corresponding ﬂuctuation amplitude of
the diagonal matrix elements. We believe that in spite
of the possible overestimate of the ﬂuctuation associated
with the high frequency modes, we can safely conclude
that the disorder in the B850 system is diagonal rather
than oﬀ-diagonal in nature.

The time-dependent eﬀective Hamiltonian description
revealed an exciton spectrum red-shifted as compared to
the spectrum of individual BChls. This red-shift is well
known in J-aggregates, and is attributed to the transfer-
ring of the dipole strength into low-energy exciton states.
The observation that the ﬂuctuations of the BChl
site energies could be attributed largely to high fre-
quency intramolecular vibrational modes, with energy
1, 700 cm−1, prompted us to model the
ω0 ∼
eﬀect of dynamic disorder on the B850 excitons by em-
ploying a polaron Hamiltonian, which describes both ex-
citons and the coupled single phonon mode by quantum
mechanics. The strength of the exciton-phonon coupling
g is related to the RMSD of the ﬂuctuating site energies,
and was found to be weak. By employing standard per-
turbation theory we investigated the eﬀect of dynamic
disorder (i.e., exciton-phonon coupling) on the energy
dispersion and localization of the excitons. We found
that in contrast to static disorder, which leads to a broad-
ening of the exciton bandwidth, dynamic disorder due to
high frequency vibrational modes leads to a reduction of
the width of the exciton energy band. Also, our polaron
calculations showed that dynamic disorder reduces only
slightly the exciton delocalization length (from around
6 BChls to 5 BChls at room temperature), conﬁrming
previous results according to which the main mechanism
responsible for exciton localization in LH-II rings is ther-
mal averaging [14].

By employing the cumulant expansion method, we cal-
culated, in the framework of the polaron model, the ab-
sorption spectrum of the B850 BChl, with and without
exciton coupling, for a single phonon mode as well as for
a distribution of phonons. The absorption spectrum of
the excitonic system coupled to a single high frequency
phonon ω0 (intramolecular vibronic mode) is given by a
series of Dirac-delta functions (stick spectrum), with dif-
ferent weights. In order to obtain a realistic, broadened
absorption spectrum, which can be compared with the
one measured experimentally we had to included the ef-
fect of the entire phonon distribution through the phonon
spectral density J(ω). We have shown that J(ω), which
accounts for both coupling strengths and frequencies of

C

the individual phonon components, can be determined
from the autocorrelation function
(t) of the energy gap
ﬂuctuations of individual BChls, readily available from
our combined MD/quantum chemistry simulation. We
found that in our model only three inputs, namely au-
tocorrelation function
(t), temperature T and optically
active exciton level ǫk, are needed to calculate the absorp-
tion spectrum. Considering the fact that these inputs
come directly from our MD/QC calculations, and that
we have no free parameters, the agreement between the
spectrum obtained from the polaron model calculations
and the experimental spectrum is remarkable.

Abstract

We study the steady state properties of a phenomenological two-state preda-

tor model in presence of correlated Gaussian white noise. Based on the cor-

responding Fokker-Planck equation for probability distribution function the

steady state solution of the probability distribution function and its extrema

have been investigated. We show for a typical value of noise correlation there

is a giant loss of bistability which in turn prevents the prey population from

going into extinction.

Keywords: Correlated noise, bistability, two-state predator model.

I. INTRODUCTION

The subject of noise-induced transition has got wide applications in the ﬁeld of physics,

chemistry and biology [1]. In most of these theories the noise aﬀects the dynamics through

system variable, i.e., the noise is multiplicative in nature. The focal theme of these inves-

tigations is the study of steady state properties of the system where the ﬂuctuations, in

general, are applied from outside and are independent of the system’s characteristic dissipa-

tion. Such systems are generally termed as open systems [2], since they lack the principle

of detailed balance which ensures ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation to hold for the thermo-

dynamically closed systems. However, it may also happen that the external ﬂuctuations

instead of aﬀecting only some system’s parameters aﬀect the system directly, i.e., they drive

system dynamics multiplicatively as well as additively. Because the two noise processes owe

a common origin they get correlated in the relevant timescale of the problem [3,4]. Corre-

lated noise processes have found applications in studying steady state properties of a single

mode laser [5], in analyzing bistable kinetics [6], in producing directed motion in spatially

symmetric periodic potentials [7], in studying stochastic resonance in linear systems [8], in

steady state entropy production [9], etc. In this brief communication we investigate a simple

noise-driven two-state predator model [1] and show how noise correlation can dynamically

prevent the prey population from extinction.

II. THE MODEL

To start with we consider an environment of the prey which in absence of predation grows

logistically and at the same time its density in a territory depends linearly on a constant

source of migration. We also consider a population of predators in the given territory which

lives by feeding on prey. The characteristic time scale over which the population of prey

and predator varies are very much diﬀerent, so one can consider the predator population

to be constant within the generation time of prey. The predators are engaged in two types

2

of activities, viz, hunting or resting. The time scale of predator’s two activities are very

short compared to the generation time of prey, i.e., τR, τH ≪
characteristic average time of resting and hunting, respectively and µ is the birth rate of

µ−1 where τR and τH are the

prey. The activity of the predator in the territory resembles the mode of action of enzymes or

catalysts in a chemical reaction. The enzymes or catalysts in a chemical reaction transform

substrates in a continuous manner without destroying themselves. The constant predator

population acts in a similar way by feeding on the prey. To put this ideas in a quantitative

way we write the evolution equations for the predator and prey [1],

˙X = A + µX

˙Y =

(cid:18)

XY ,

where X is the density of prey in a given territory. The constant A in Eq.(1) is due to a

constant source of prey through immigration. The second term in (1) is the Fisher logistic

growth term with birth rate µ and carrying capacity K. Y and Z are the numbers of

predators in the hunting and resting state, respectively. E is the total constant population

of the predators, i.e., E

Y (t) + Z(t) = constant. The last term in (1) describes the decay

≡

rate of prey. The model is hybrid in nature in the sense that it has virtue of taking into

consideration of the logistic growth model as well as of the predator-prey model.

We now consider that the predator population, E is small compared to prey popula-

tion X. To study the overall dynamics within the timescale µ−1 we make the following

transformation

τH = ετ ∗

H , τR = ετ ∗

R , Y = εY ∗ and Z = εZ ∗

where ε is a small quantity, τ ∗

H, τ ∗

R are quantities of order µ−1 and Y ∗, Z ∗ are quantities of

order X. Using (3) in (1) and (2) we arrive at

It is interesting to note that the third term in Eq.(6) is the predation term which essentially

emerges from the two-state of predator activities. The steady state solution of Eq.(6) shows

a cusp type of catastrophe. The corresponding critical point (αc, βc, xc) is given by

αc =

(1

θ)2

−
27θ2

, βc =

and xc =

(1 + 2θ)3
27θ2

.

The necessary condition to have a physically realizable critical point i.e., for αc, xc to be

positive, is θ < 1. Thus the steady state curve of x as a function of β always shows a bistable

region for small values of θ. The smallness condition may be maintained by increasing the

carrying capacity K or by decreasing the ratio τH /τR.

Eq.(6) is the starting point of our further analysis. It may be noted that α and β are the

two quantities which appear in the prey evolution equation as a constant and a multiplicative

factor, respectively. Expressions for α and β in (7) suggest that they are connected by a

common parameter µ, the birth rate of the prey. Now if due to some environmental external

disturbance the birth rate of the prey ﬂuctuates, it is likely to aﬀect both α and β in the form

of additive and multiplicative noises which are connected through a correlation parameter.

Or in other words the external ﬂuctuations aﬀect the parameter β which ﬂuctuates around

a mean value, thus generating multiplicative noise and at the same time environmental

ﬂuctuations perturbs the dynamics directly which gives rise to additive noise. As a result

we have

For zero noise correlation, i.e., for λ = 0 the last term of Eq.(22) vanishes and we have

the extrema of SPDF for pure multiplicative noise processes [1]. For zero correlation the

additive noise has no extra eﬀects in the steady state dynamics. To illustrate this we have

plotted extrema of SPDF as a function of β in Fig.(1) using the parameters given in [1].

For zero noise correlation the curve shows a sharp minima which decreases on increasing

λ. Similarly, in Fig.(2) we have plotted extrema of SPDF as a function of β for diﬀerent

values of additive noise strength D with maximum correlation (λ = 1). As the additive

6

noise strength increases the well gets ﬂattened and almost vanishes for a large enough value

of D.

In Fig.(3) we show the eﬀect of correlation parameter λ on SPDF. For a low value of λ

the SPDF shows the typical bistable region ( see Fig.3(a) ) which vanishes for higher values

of λ ( see Fig.3(b) ). As the value of correlation parameter λ increases the peak on the lower

values of x decreases while for a higher value of λ we have a single peak at a higher values

of x. Since x denotes the prey population, it is clear from Fig.(3) that with the increase

of λ values the prey population recovers from going into extinction.

In other words, the

distribution of prey which was mainly peaked about zero (for a low value of λ) signifying

high extinction rate, moves away from zero with the increase of correlation between noises

thus favouring the prey’s survival. Though Gaussian white noise acting independently and

multiplicatively favours the extinction of prey [1], the extinction rate decreases drastically

for a simultaneous perturbation of additive and multiplicative white noise originating from

a common source, hence connected through a correlation parameter.

From the expressions of f (x), b and c given in Eqs.(19) and (20) it is clear that for λ = 1.0

we have always a singular distribution for σ = D, since it makes both the parameter b and

c zero and eventually leads to the divergence of all the q’s and ν. However this divergence

can be removed for appreciable diﬀerence between the σ and D values.

In Fig.(4) we

have plotted the typical behaviour of SPDF for maximum correlation λ = 1 which shows

monotonic decreasing behaviour.

In contrast to the behaviour shown in Fig.(3), Fig.(4),

however, shows the hastening of prey’s extinction for a full correlation between additive and

multiplicative noises.

In this brief communication we have studied the eﬀect of environmental ﬂuctuation of

the birth rate of the prey in terms of external correlated noise processes which appreciably

modify the macroscopic behaviour of a two-state predator model. We have shown how the

correlation between the two noise processes which owe a common origin may drastically

prevent the extinction of the prey.

Abstract

Finding out statistically signiﬁcant words in DNA and protein sequences forms the basis

for many genetic studies. By applying the maximal entropy principle, we give one systematic

way to study the nonrandom occurrence of words in DNA or protein sequences. Through

comparison with experimental results, it was shown that patterns of regulatory binding

sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast) genomes tend to occur signiﬁcantly in the promoter

regions. We studied two correlated gene family of yeast. The method successfully extracts

the binding sites variﬁed by experiments in each family. Many putative regulatory sites in

the upstream regions are proposed. The study also suggested that some regulatory sites are

active in both directions, while others show directional preference.

1 Introduction.

It is attractive, but not unexpected, that DNA and protein sequences deviate remarkably from

random sequences [1]. According to information theory, random sequences carry minimal infor-

mation (maximal entropy) [2], while the total information of life is assumed to be in DNA and

protein sequences. As a result, investigation on the non-randomness of DNA and amino acid

sequences would be the focus of Bioinformatics.

To ﬁnd out nonrandom occurrence of words (short strings) in non-coding DNA sequences

is interesting because a large portion of regulatory elements of eukaryotes usually are words of

1

limit length in the non-coding sequences (for example, about 10 bases, while the core part is

about 5 bases [3]). subjected to functional constraints, the patterns of regulatory elements are

expected to deviate from random occurrence.

In this paper, by applying the Maximal Entropy Principle (MEP), we develop one way to

investigate the nonrandom occurrence of words in DNA sequences. Each word is given one

signiﬁcance index which quantiﬁes the nonrandomness occurrence of the word. The method is

then applied to study the promoter regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). [4] We compare

the theoretical result with experiments in two ways. In the ﬁrst way, the promoter database of

yeast (SCPD) [5] was analysed. It was found that, statistically, overrepresented words are more

easily encountered in the database. The second way is to study the promoters of coregulated

gene families. The experimentally found binding sites were successfully extracted, and more

putative binding sites are suggested.

In the following the method will be developed in details, and in the third section the method

will be applied to study the promoter regions of yeast.

2 Treat the nonrandomness of DNA sequences via Maximal En-

tropy Principle.

The idea comes from a simple observation. Take a long DNA sequence as an example. Given

only the (normalized) frequencies of A,C,G,T (PA,PC, PG,PT ) , one would expected that the

frequencies 2-tuples have the form

P 0

c1c2 = Pc1×Pc2

(1)

Here c1 and c2 are one of the four bases A, C, G, T .

Comparison between the measured frequency Pc1c2 and the expected value P 0

c1c2 reveals the

statistical signiﬁcance of c1c2 in the sequence.

To generalize the above idea, one encounters the problem to predict the frequencies of k + 1-

tuples from the frequencies of k-tuples when k > 1. A reasonable deﬁnation can then be used

to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of words longer than two bases.

The following is an attemption to answer this problem. In the treatment, when the compo-
sition of a k-tuple is concerned, the word will be written as c1c2···ck−1ck. However when only
the length k of the word is relevant, it will be given in the form of wk. A combinatory form
may also be used. For example, wkc (cwk) is the word obtained by adding a letter c to the right
(left) of wk. The measured and expected frequencies of wk in the sequence will be written as
Pwk and P 0

wk, respectively.

2

There are a total of 4k k-tuples. For prediction the Maximal Entropy Principle (MEP)

is a prefered choice. According to modern genetics, the driving force for nucleotide sequence

evolution is, on one hand, random mutations of bases that maximize the entropy, and, on

the other hand, the natural selection which subjects the maximization of entropy to certain

constraints. Therefore, DNA sequence analysis shows intrinsic correlation to the MEP. One

brief introduction (which is necessary for our use) to MEP will be given below. More details

can be found in e.g. [6].

Suppose that {Pi, i = 0, 1, 2,···} is a discrete distribution. An information entropy can be

deﬁned on it [2]:

S = X
i

PilnPi.

Usually {Pi} satisﬁes some constraints:

Fj({Pi}) = 0,

j = 1, 2, . . ., M.

Here M is the number of constraints. Deﬁne a target function:

H = S +

M
X
j=1

λjFj({Pi}),

(2)

(3)

(4)

λj being Largrange factors. MEP states that the distribution minimizing the target function H

is the most reasonable distribution satisfying constraints (3). This, however, does not state that
{Pi} is the only distribution satisfying (3).

The MEP now can be applied to study the problem raised above. The entropy function here

is:

S = X
i

P 0

wk+1(i)lnP 0

wk+1(i),

where i is a index used to distinguish k-tuples from each other. (In order to get the index of a

word, the following maps were used: A to 0, C to 1, G to 2, and T to 3. The original word is

thus mapped to a string containing only 0,1,2 and 3. The string is then considered as quaternary

number. After being transformed to decimal, the number is used as the index of the word.)

Constraints in the present problem is:

Pwk(i) = X

P 0

wk(i)c,

c

Pwk(i) = X

P 0

cwk(i),

c

i = 0, 1, 2,···, 4k − 1.

3

(5)

P 0
wk+1 is the frequency needs to be predicted and Pwk is the frequency already known. There
is a total of 2×4k constraints. It is possible that these constraints are linearly related, so that
the number of eﬀective constraints is smaller than 2×4k. This, however, does not alternate the
result.

The solution can be obtained:

P 0

c1c2 ···ck+1 =

Pc1c2 ···ck×Pc2c3 ···ck+1

Pc2c3 ···ck

.

(6)

When k=1, the solution reduces to the intuitively result, eq.(1).

The above treatment is from k-tuples to k + 1-tuples. As a generic scheme, the MEP can

also be applied to predict the frequencies of k + 2-tuples, k + 3-tuples and so on, based on the

frequency of k-tuples. Actually, one can get the result by repeatedly applying eq. (6). For

example:

P 0

c1c2 ···ck+1ck+2 =

P 0

c1c2 ···ck+1×P 0
Pc2c3 ···ck+1

c2c3 ···ck+2

=

Pc1c2 ···ck×Pc2c3 ···ck+1×Pc3c4 ···ck+2

Pc2c3 ···ck×Pc3c4 ···ck+1

.

(7)

Thus, when one refers to the expected frequency of a certain word of length k, the knowledge

that the prediction is based on must be pointed out.

With the frequencies of longer words, one can always obtain the frequencies of shorter ones.

On the other hand, the expected frequencies of longer words, eq.(6), is predicted from the

frequencies of shorter words, with no more information added. Therefore, the deviation of

the measured frequencies from the expected ones gives new information emerges only in the

frequencies of the longer words. In order to use this part of information, we refer to the following

signiﬁcance index

Iwk =

wk
The indexs of k-tuples form a vector of 4k dimension.

Pwk − P 0

pP 0

wk

.

(8)

It should be pointed out that the simple solution eq.(6) results from the constraints, eq.(5).

Although there are many ways to write down the prediction [7, 8], the Maximal Entropy Principle

ensure that, submitted to these constraints, the solution eq.(6) is the best one. However, one

can consider more constraints. Expect for the continuous words, spaced patterns can also be

involved in the above statistical treatment [8]. As an example, consider the spaced word c1-
c2, where c1 and c2 are certain bases and the base between them is not relevant. One more
constraint

Pc1−c2 = X
c

Pc1cc2

4

can be added to the frequencies of 3-tuples, and the statistical signiﬁcance of the spaced words

can also be evaluated. The MEP, as a general framework, is still applicable, but there will be

no simple explicit solution as eq.(6).

3 The relationship between regulatory elements and statisti-

cally signiﬁcant words in the yeast promoter regions.

With the accumulation of huge amount of genome sequences, analysis of the regulatory regions

becomes urgent, because they govern the regulation of gene expression. Finding out the regula-

tory sites in Eukaryotes genomes is especially diﬃcult, largely because of their strong variance.

This, however, gives the chance for statistical methods to play an important role in binding sites

prediction.

The regulatory elements are functionally constrained and are often shared by many genes.

As a result, the sites are expected to be signiﬁcantly represented. Based on this belief, the

method developed above is expected to be applicable in ﬁnding regulatory sites in the promoter

regions of yeast. we employ two ways to check this point.

In the ﬁrst way, as just an illustration of the eﬀectiveness of the MEP treatment, a data

set including all the promoters of yeast will be used to perform the statistical evaluation. The

promoter regions refer, according to Zhang [3], to the upstream region of 500 bases long. From
the sequence set the word frequencies are obtained and Iwk, k = 2,··· , 8, are calculated according
to eq.(6) and eq.(8). (to obtain Iwk, P 0
wk is predicted based on the frequency of k-1-tuples.)
For comparison the index Iwk, k = 2,··· , 8, of words in the coding regions (CDSs) of yeast were
also calculated.

To compare the signiﬁcance index of words with experimentally veriﬁed regulatory elements,

a strongly statistically characterized method was pursued. The promoter database of yeast

collected by Zhou et al. [5] was used as targets. One word is called to hit the target if it covers a

known regulatory element or part of the element. In this way, each word will be checked against

all the elements in the database. We want to see if the total hits of words show correlation with

the signiﬁcance index.

Fig.1 shows the ratio of the average hits of words whose signiﬁcance index are larger than

a certain cutoﬀ (5.0, 3.0, or 2.0) to the average hits of all the k-tuples. Some properties of

signiﬁcance index in the promoter regions are revealed. First, for all the cutoﬀ value shown in

ﬁg.1, the ratios are always larger than 1. Second, when the words are longer than 4 bases, the

average hits increase with the increase of cutoﬀ. Furthermore, the ratio also increases with the

5

increase of word length. As a comparison, Fig.1 shows that the ratio of hits does not depend on

signiﬁcance index in the CDS regions.

To see the dependence of hits on signiﬁcance index further, words are divided into groups

according to their signiﬁcance index values. In each group the hits were averaged. See table 1,

and Fig.2 which is based upon the data in Table.1 but shown as a more audio-visual illustration.

The dependence of hits on signiﬁcance index shown in Fig.1 is seen again. Furthermore, the

average hits are not the monotonic function of signiﬁcance index in the promoter regions. For

words with both positively and negatively large signiﬁcance index in the promoter regions, the

average hits are larger than those of words whose signiﬁcance index is around zero. Again no

dependence of average hits on signiﬁcance index in CDS regions is observed in Table.1 and Fig.2.

That words with large negative signiﬁcant index in the promoter regions also show higher

aﬃnity to binding sites deserves more consideration. One account is that although some regula-

tory elements, such as those involved in the expression of housekeeping genes, are expected to be

overrepresented since large amount of the genes are needed, others that control the expression

of some essential but restrictedly needed genes, are expected to be underrepresented to avoid

inappropriate translation. However, more convincing explaination exists:

if a word, e.g., wA,

has high positive index, then some of wC,wG,wT are expected to have negative index. This can

be seen from the following example. While the index of TATAT is 16.3, that of TATAA is -12.2.

Actually, both have much high counts in the sequences and both are variance of binding site of

the same transcriptional factor.

For universally existing regulatory elements, as expected, the signiﬁcance index in the pro-

moter regions are much high. One example is the poly(A/T) stretches. As given above, the

signiﬁcance index of TATAT is 16.3. Also the signiﬁcance index of TATATAT, 8.1, is high. As

another example, the signiﬁcance index of the core of CAAT-box, CAAT, is 8.95. However,

in order to develop an algorithm for regulatory elements prediction, more subtle consideration

must be involved. First, genes are needed to be classiﬁed into families to improve the composi-

tional bias of the sequences. Furthermore, more complicated usage of the information given by

signiﬁcance index should be considered, because, according to eq.(7), the expected frequency of
k-mers can be deﬁned in k − 1 ways, i.e., based on the frequency of 1, 2,··· , k − 1-mers, respec-
tively. For each deﬁnition the signiﬁcance index can be obtained. On considering the statistical

property of words in the sequences, each of these indexes would give useful information. We

choose two coregulated gene family to further test our method.

The coregulated genes of yeast metabolism have been widely studied, and these datasets pro-

vide ideal material to test the methods for binding sites prediction. Two families of coregulated

6

genes, GCN and TUP, were shown in table 2. Detailed information on them can be found in [9].

For each family, the frequencies of 6-tuples in the promoter regions were ﬁrst collected. The

expected frequencies them were predicted in ﬁve ways, which are based on the frequencies of

bases, 2-tuples, 3-tuples, 4-tuples, 5-tuples, respectively. In stead of Iwk, a simpler signiﬁcance
index Pwk/P 0
wk was used. In our study only the single strand of promoter sequences is consid-
ered. This is diﬀerent from that of [9]. They count the number of each words in both strands.
In this way there are only 2080 distinct oligonucleotides, while the number in ours is 46 = 4096.

Table 3 shows the words that possess no less than 3 among the 5 signiﬁcance index larger than 3.

There are 13 such words for GCN family, and 23 for TUP family. In table 3 several words tend

to cluster together to form a longer pattern. Generally speaking, the clusters can be expanded

by involving words with slightly lower signiﬁcance.

In both families, 6-tuples corresponding to regulatory binding sites found by experimental

analysis are observed in table 3. See the ﬁrst cluster of words for GCN family and the ﬁrst and

the second clusters for TUP family. Most of these words also show high statistical signiﬁcance

in the analysis of [9]. Some words predicted by [9] but not variﬁed by experiments are also

observed in table 3 (signiﬁcant words shared by [9] and the present analysis are shown in bold in

table 3). However, our analysis also found many signiﬁcant words which do not show as highly

signiﬁcant scores according to [9].

Two clusters of words for TUP families is noteworthy (see the ﬁrst and the second clus-

ters in table 3). The ﬁrst cluster includes GTGGGG, AGGGGC, ACGGGC, TGGGGT, and

GGGGTA, and the second cluster involves TACCCC, ACCCCG, CCCCGC, and CCCCAC. be-

tween them GTGGGG and CCCCAC, GGGGTA and TACCCC are reverse complements. The

two clusters both correspond to the binding sites of transcription factor Mig1p (Zn ﬁnger), but

seen from diﬀerent strands. This may imply that the binding sites of Mig1p are active in both

orientation. This property, however, was not found for the binding sites of Gcn4p (see table

3). For example, when the cutoﬀ of signiﬁcance index is reduced to 1.3 (now 46 words satisfy

the creterion), the cluster of TGACTC and GACTCA expands to involve another 4 members:

CGATGA, GATGAC, ATGACT, and GTGACT; while only one of inverse complements of them,

GAGTCA, also has 3 index larger than 1.3. Among the 46 words, it can only be clustered with

another words GGAGTC. Thus, the binding sites of Gcn4p seem to be active preferencially in

one direction.

Among the available methods of binding sites prediction, ours is similar to that of [9] in that

both work by deﬁning expected frequencies of words. the diﬀerence is that our method deﬁnes

the expected frequences on the statistical stproperties of the sequences themselves, while [9]

7

more or less heuristically deﬁnes the word frequencies of whole non-coding sequences as the

expected value. It is thus expected that our method is more precise and gives more unbiased

result.

An alternative method developed by Li et al [10]. gives more subtle consideration on the

statistical feature of DNA sequences. In their model, the sequence is considered as a text without

interwords dilimiters. They apply maximal likelihood consideration to recover the words, which

they consider as possible binding site condidates. But the computation is far more complex to

get meaningful result.

More methods to detect unknown elements within funtionally related sequences are availible

(for a review, see [11]), most of which, such as the consensus [12] and the Gibbs sampler [13],

are based upon well diﬁned biological models. The type of signals that can be detected are

generally limited; it is diﬃcult for them to detect multiple signals. But these methods are able

to detect much larger patterns with high precision. The present method can be used to detect

multiple elements, but the pattern it can ﬁnd is short.

It is also a widely explored problem in biology to compare the noncoding and coding regions of

DNA sequences [14, 15, 16]. The MEP treatment gives one systematic way to study the statistical

diﬀerences between coding and noncoding regions. In table.1 it is shown that signiﬁcance index

in CDS regions distribute much more stretchy than that of the promoter regions. The contrast

keeps for all the word lengths we studied (up to 8 bases). This reveals that CDS regions are

in a more nonrandom state. Two factors may help to interpret this phenomenon. First, the

mutation rate of CDS regions is much lower than that of the promoter regions [15]. Secondly,

the code usage in CDS region is universal and deﬁnite, while in the promoter regions the length

of regulatory elements diﬀer from each other and the regulatory elements may diﬀer strongly

from the consensus sequences.

Table 3: Highly overrepresented words in promoter regions of GCN and TUP family.For each

family, the 6-tuples with no less than 3 among the 5 signiﬁcance index larger than 3 are indicated.

The words also appear in table 2 of [9] as signiﬁcant patterns are highlighted in bold. Words
are clustered according to their similarity. sig(i) is the value of Pw6/P 0
frequency of 6-tuple w6 predicted based on the frequencied of i-tuples.

Signal detection by means of phase coherence induced through phase resetting

(Dated: January 9, 2014)

Detection and location of moving prey utilizing electrosense or mechanosense is a strategy com-
monly followed by animals which cannot rely on visual sense or hearing. In this article we consider
the possibility to detect the source of a localized stimulus that travels along a chain of detectors at
constant speed. The detectors are autonomous oscillators whose frequencies have a given natural
spread. The detection mechanism is based on phase coherence which is built up by phase resetting
induced by the passing stimulus.

PACS numbers: 87.10.+e,87.19.Bb

The ability to detect, locate, and capture prey is vital
for survival. Many animals accomplish these tasks us-
ing visual or acoustic information. However, species that
have developed in an environment where these senses are
obscured, have to rely on alternative mechanisms. For
example, the paddleﬁsh (Polyodon spathula), found in
the river basins of the Midwestern United States and in
the Yangtze River in China, makes use of a passive elec-
trosensory system [1]. Another example is the weakly
electric ﬁsh that combines active and passive electrosense
with a mechanosensory lateral line system [2]. In these
animals, receptors transform stimuli into electric signals
which excite the terminals of primary aﬀerent neurons.
These aﬀerents are well known to exhibit periodic spike
patterns [3].

In the last decades a lot of research has been devoted
to the details of information processing on the neural
level, i.e., the dynamics of single neurons or neural net-
works. However, at the behavioral level still many open
problems exist. Since the performance and the analysis
of experiments usually involve an enormous eﬀort, eﬃ-
cient and tractable models are indispensable, both for
planning and interpretation.

Here we present an idealized, however, analytically
tractable model, proposing a mechanism for the detec-
tion of a localized stimulus. This stimulus is passing an
array of receptors, which we model as phase oscillators.
To measure the degree of coherence between the oscilla-
tors we choose the well known synchronization index [4].
First we examine the inﬂuence of a random initial dis-
tribution of the oscillator phases on the synchronization
index and introduce a threshold value to distinguish a
stimulus from a “false alarm”. Then we investigate the
inﬂuence of our model parameters for the detection of a
moving stimulus.

We consider a linear chain of N uncoupled phase
rotors which are characterized by the set of variables
ψ1, . . . , ψN . The rotors are aligned at equal distance
along an axis of length L, i.e. the position of rotor k
1)L, k = 1, . . . , N . Each rotor

has its own natural frequency Ωk which, in the absence
of a stimulus, determines the simple linear growth of the
phase, i.e. ψk(t) = ψk(0) + Ωkt. We assume the fre-
quencies to be independently and identically distributed
according to a Gaussian with mean Ω0 and standard de-
viation ∆Ω = ηΩ0.

An appropriate quantity to measure the degree of
phase coherence among these rotors is the complex vari-
able

Z(t) =

exp [iψk(t)] =: R(t) exp [iΦ(t)] .

This global order parameter contains both the informa-

the instantaneous degree of phase coherence measured by

We initialize the array by randomly selecting a phase
for each of the rotors according to the uniform distribu-
tion on [0, 2π). Thus, the quantity R0 = R(t = 0) is a
random variable. Its density contains important informa-
tion because even in the absence of any signal the array
of rotors will generate nonvanishing values of R0. These
have to be discriminated from values of R(t) which signif-
icantly indicate coherence induced by the passing stim-
ulus. Figure 1 shows numerically estimated densities,

2/√N corresponds to α(Rth)
2% which means values
larger than 2/√N occur by random conﬁguration with a
probability of less than 2%. In what follows we will use
Rth = 2/√N to discriminate stimuli against the random
conﬁguration background.

A standard model describing phase resetting by an ex-
ternal stimulus of strength I is given by the following
phase dynamics [6]:

˙ψ = Ω + I cos ψ .

(10)

This dynamics can be illustrated as the overdamped mo-
tion in a tilted corrugated potential landscape. If I < Ω
no troughs (minima) and barriers (maxima) exist and
the phase continues cycling forward (Ω > 0) at varying
speed. For I > Ω two ﬁxed points emerge, which corre-
spond to a minimum at π
arccos(Ω/I) and a maximum
at π + arccos(Ω/I). For constant I the phase settles in
the minimum (mod2π) regardless of the initial position,
which means the phase eventually is reset to the corre-
sponding value ψ∗ = π
arccos(Ω/I). The situation is
harder to analyze with a time varying stimulus I(t); the
net eﬀect will depend on many details of the stimulus,
e.g., the time scale of variation, the height of the signal
peak, etc.

Our detection setup would require to consider N such
phase equations each with its own time varying stimulus
vt), where x0 and v are the initial position
Ik(x0 −
(at time t = 0) and the constant velocity of the travel-
ing stimulus, respectively. Irrespective of the details, the
equation of motion will be too complicated to be solved
analytically in closed form. If, however, the peak value of
the stimulus is suﬃciently high and the duration is short,
we can simplify the resetting mechanism: The passing
stimulus resets the phase ψk(t) to some global value ψ∗
the very moment it is at position xk, i.e., the reset is in-
stantaneous. After this reset the phase again increases
linearly with its natural frequency Ωk. The situation is
sketched in Fig. 2. The history of phase ψk can thus be

written as

terize the net eﬀect of observing many realizations, i.e.,
to evaluate the mean performance of many individuals,
we average the synchronization index over both the ini-
tial phases (equidistributed) and the natural frequencies
(Gaussian). The ﬁrst average over the phases yields (for

th = 4/N , is shown in Fig. 3 for N = 100 (top) and
N = 10 (bottom). It can be seen that detection works
only as long as detuning, quantiﬁed by δ, and frequency
spread, coded by η, are not too large. Moreover, we ﬁnd
that the detection region shrinks in the δ direction, but
enlarges in the x direction with increasing N , i.e., detec-
tion already works when the stimulus has passed only a
small number of oscillators. For small η and small δ we
can consider the following limiting cases: First let us deal
with the case of zero frequency spread, i.e., η = 0. The
double sum over cosines can be performed yielding the
following expression,

which we exemplify for N = 100 in Fig. 4. Depending
on the detuning parameter δ, constructive or destruc-
tive eﬀects show up. Introducing the frequency spread
η > 0 erodes both the constructive and destructive ef-
fects. Note that the cycle number m matters if η > 0
whereas it is irrelevant for the case η = 0. In Fig. 5 we
exemplify how the detection curve for N = 100, m = 1
and a detuning value of δ = 0.01π is pushed below the
detection threshold by an increasing frequency spread η.
These results indicate that the detection mechanism is

rather sensitive with respect to the width of the frequency
distribution for a large number N of oscillators. However,
we would like to point out, that the biological relevance
is not eradicated by this ﬁnding, since evolutionary opti-
mization oﬀers an explanation how the conﬁned param-
eter range might have been realized.

In conclusion, we have presented a simpliﬁed but an-
alytically tractable model for signal detection, which
works by creating signiﬁcant coherence in a chain of
phase oscillators. This coherence is induced by a strongly
localized stimulus that travels at constant speed and re-
sets phases instantaneously. The ability to detect a stim-
ulus rapidly is balanced by the sensitivity to variations
in the oscillator frequencies or deviations from the opti-
mal velocity. The variations in the frequencies, however,
guarantee a fast desynchronization after the stimulus has
passed.

Although our approach concentrates on seemingly
crude assumptions, it catches the main features of prey
detection. Future experimental studies have to reveal in
which direction this model has to be extended to account
for given biological applications.

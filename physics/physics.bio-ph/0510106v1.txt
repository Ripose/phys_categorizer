The stability of solitons in biomembranes and nerves

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We examine the stability of a class of solitons, obtained from a generalization of the Boussinesq
equation, which have been proposed to be relevant for pulse propagation in biomembranes and
nerves. These solitons are found to be stable with respect to small amplitude ﬂuctuations. They
emerge naturally from non-solitonic initial excitations and are robust in the presence of dissipation.

INTRODUCTION

The action potential in nerves is a propagating volt-
age pulse across the axonal membrane with an ampli-
tude of about 100 mV. In 1952, A. L. Hodgkin and A.
F. Huxley proposed a theory for the nerve pulse which
has since become the textbook model [1]. Their pic-
ture is based on the equilibration of ion gradients across
the nerve membrane through speciﬁc ion-conducting pro-
teins (called ion channels) which leads to transient volt-
age changes. Hodgkin-Huxley theory thus relies on dis-
sipative processes and is intrinsically not isentropic. It
is rather based on Kirchhoﬀ circuits involing capacitors
(the nerve membrane), resistors (the ion channels) and
electrical currents introduced by the ion ﬂuxes.

We have recently proposed an alternative model for
the nerve pulses based on the propagation of a local-
ized density pulse (soliton) in the axon membrane [2].
This model has several advantages over the Hodgkin-
Huxley model.
It explains the reversible temperature
and heat changes observed in connection with the nerve
pulse. (Such reversible changes are not consistent with
the Hodgkin-Huxley theory but rather suggest that an
isentropic process is responsible for the action potential
[3, 4, 5].)
It further predicts the correct pulse propa-
gation velocities in myelinated nerves. These velocities
are closely related to the lateral sound velocities in the
nerve membrane. One essential feature of our model is
the presence of empirically known lipid phase transitions
slightly below physiological temperatures. The closer the
phase transition is to physiological temperatures, the eas-
ier it is to excite the nerve pulse. Our model therefore
immediately explains another interesting feature of nerve
excitation, i.e., that the nerve pulse can be induced by a
sudden cooling of the nerve, and that it can be inhibited
by a temperature increase [7]. During compression, the
appearance of a voltage pulse is merely a consequence of
the piezo-electric nature of the nerve membrane, which
is partially charged and asymmetric.

Another advantage of a soliton-based description of
pulse propagation in nerves lies in its predictive power.
Given measured values of the compression modulus as a
function of lateral density and frequency, soliton prop-

erties (including its shape and its energy) can be deter-
mined uniquely as a function of soliton velocity. Given a
measured soliton velocity, the theory contains no freely
adjustable parameters and has the virtue of being falsi-
ﬁable.

In [2] the possibility of soliton propagation was ex-
plored and compared to observations in real nerves. In
the present paper we study some intrinsic features of
these solitons, in particular the stability of such pulses
in the presence of noise and dissipation. Such investi-
gations are necessary to demonstrate that such pulses
could propagate under realistic physiological conditions
over the length scales of nerves (as much as several me-
ters) even in the presence of friction and lateral hetero-
geneities. In the following section, we will state the model
more precisely and derive the analytic form of its soli-
tonic solutions. We will then turn to a description of
the numerical methods used here. We use these methods
to probe (i) the stability of solitons with respect to “in-
ﬁnitesimal” perturbations (i.e., lattice noise), (ii) the way
in which solitons are produced by localized non-solitonic
initial excitations of the system, and (iii) the behavior of
solitons in the presence of dissipation. We will demon-
strate that the solitons of Ref. [2] are remarkably robust
with respect to all of these perturbations.

ANALYTIC CONSIDERATIONS

Thermodynamic measurements of the lipids of biolog-
ical membranes reveal a number of interesting features
of potential relevance for understanding the nature of
pulses in biomembranes and nerves. In particular, such
systems display an order-disorder transition at tempera-
tures somewhat below that of biological interest from a
low temperature “solid-ordered” phase to a high temper-
ature “liquid-disordered” phase in which both the lateral
order and chain order of the lipid molecules is lost [8].
The proximity of this phase transition to temperatures
of biological interest has striking eﬀects on the compres-
sion modulus and, hence, on the sound velocity [9, 10].
For densities some 10% above the equilibrium density,
the low-frequency sound velocity is reduced by roughly
a factor of 3 from the velocity of c0 = 176.6 m/s found

at equilibrium. The sound velocity then rises sharply,
returning to the value c0 at a density roughly 20% above
the equilibrium density. Measurements at high frequen-
cies (i.e., 5 MHz) reveal a much smaller dip in the lateral
compression modulus and a sound velocity that is always
materially larger than that at low frequencies and thus
indicate the presence of signiﬁcant dispersion [10, 11].

In Ref. [2], these features were exploited to suggest that
the propagation of sound in these lipid mixtures can be
described by the equation

quency sound velocity is c0 = 176.6 m/s. The coeﬃcients
p and q were ﬁtted to measured values of the sound ve-
locity as a function of density. Although high frequency
sound velocity measurements indicate that the dispersive
coeﬃcient, h, must be positive, neither the magnitude of
h nor the speciﬁc form of this term have been veriﬁed ex-
perimentally. In practice, the only role of h is to establish
the linear size of solitons, and it can thus be chosen, e.g.,
so that the width of the soliton is comparable to that
known for nerve pulses. Here, we choose to work with
the dimensionless variables u, x and t deﬁned as

ties. We now determine the analytic form of these soli-
tons.

As expected, Eq. (3) can be obtained from a suitable
energy density. We thus seek an energy density,

that Eq. (3) will result from variation of the correspond-
ing Lagrangian density. To this end, it is useful to intro-
duce the dimensionless displacement, s(x, t), deﬁned as

Although the simplicity of the analytic form of these soli-

The two terms in Eq. (11) represent the kinetic and po-
tential energy densities, respectively. The corresponding
Lagrangian density is obtained by changing the sign of
the potential energy term, and Eq. (1) follows by stan-
dard variational arguments. This form of the energy
density leads to two important observations. First, we
note that the energy density simpliﬁes considerably if
u describes a soliton and is given by Eq. (10). Speciﬁ-
cally, use of the equation of motion allows us to write the
sol = u2A(u). The speciﬁc form of
energy density as
Eq. (10) is suﬃciently simple that the energy of a soliton
can be calculated analytically and involves only elemen-
tary functions.

E

It is also useful to consider the total energy associated
with an arbitrary solution, u(x, t), of Eq. (3) as given
,
by the integral over all space of the energy density,
E
of Eq. (11). Recognizing perfect diﬀerentials when they
arise and making use of the equation of motion, Eq. (3),
we ﬁnd the expected result that the energy is independent

assumes either that u(x, t) vanishes as
or that

it satisﬁes periodic boundary conditions in x.) It is also
useful to consider the time dependence of the the integral
of u over all space,

| → ∞

U =

u(x, t) dx .

(13)

Z

It is clear from the equation of motion that ∂2U/∂t2 can
be expressed as an integral of perfect diﬀerentials. Hence,
∂2U/∂t2 = 0 if u vanishes at spatial inﬁnity or is periodic.
Thus, the time dependence of U is elementary and can
include only a constant term and a term linear in t. As
we shall see below, U is independent of time when u(x, t)
is periodic.

NUMERICAL CONSIDERATIONS

We would like to investigate a number of questions
associated with the stability of the solitons of Eq. (10).

where w = ∂u/∂x (and incidentally v = ∂s/∂t). (Note
that the ﬁrst of Eqs. (14) ensures that the spatial integral
of u is independent of time if v is chosen to be periodic.)
Equations (14) are well-suited to numerical solution us-
ing a variant of the two-step Lax-Wendroﬀ method [12].
We consider the function, u(x, t), on a primary mesh of
equally spaced points, (p∆x, q∆t), where it has the val-
ues upq. (Evidently, we must demand ∆x < β∆t in order
to satisfy the usual Courant condition, which is neces-
sary but not suﬃcient to ensure numerical stability.) The
mesh is then extended to include half-integer values of p
and/or q. It is evident from Eqs. (14) and (15) that the
functions u, v, and f live naturally on the points (p, q)
and (p + 1/2, q + 1/2) and that w lives naturally on the
points (p + 1/2, q) and (p, q + 1/2).

The algorithm is implemented as follows: Establish the
initial values of u and v on the points (p, 0). (If u is a
solitonic solution, we simply have v(x, 0) =
βu(x, 0).)
At every time step, the values of wp+1/2,q are obtained
as

−

wp+1/2,q =

up+1,q −
∆x

up,q

,

(16)

and these values can be used to construct fpq using a sim-
ilarly symmetric diﬀerence formula. One then proceeds
to the evaluation of the functions u and v a time ∆t/2
later. In proceeding from q to q + 1/2, we deﬁne,

up+1/2,q+1/2 =

(up,q + up+1,q) +

vp,q) .
(17)
The values of wp,q and fp+1/2,q+1/2 are obtained as in
Eq. (16), and vp+1/2,q+1/2 is obtained as in Eq. (17). A
slightly diﬀerent procedure is adopted in going from time
q + 1/2 to q + 1. In this case,

the values of wp+1/2,q+1 and fp,q+1 are obtained as in
Eq. (16), and vp,q+1 is obtained in analogy with Eq. (15).
This algorithm is both fast and stable in practice. (For
the periodic boundary conditions and the choice of ∆x =
0.1 and ∆t = 0.001, used below, it was possible to follow
106 time steps without discernible loss of accuracy.)

(cid:1)

It is useful to note that energy of Eq. (11) is not rig-
orously conserved by this numerical algorithm.
In the
following numerical examples, the energy was found to
decrease at a roughly constant rate proportional to ∆x2.
This fact was used to make an appropriate choice of
∆x = 0.1. The corresponding value of ∆t = 0.001 was
selected to yield full numerical stability.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

Small amplitude noise

≈

Our primary numerical concern is to study the stabil-
ity of the solitonic solutions of Eq. (10) with respect to
“inﬁnitesimal” perturbations. We employ the parame-
ters B1 =
16.6 and B2 = 79.5 adopted in [2], for which
0.650. We will show results for an initial soliton
β0
with velocity β = β1
0.735. This soliton has a width
(i.e., full width at half maximum) of roughly 6.24, which
is the minimum width possible for the values of B1 and
B2 considered. There is, of course, no reason to believe
that a soliton on a discrete lattice with ﬁnite ∆x will have
a proﬁle identical to the analytic form of Eq. (10). The
use of this analytic form in establishing the initial values
of u and v thus inevitably introduces a measure of noise
into the numerical system. Since there is no other “natu-
ral” choice for the initial form of the solitonic excitation,
this noise represents the best approximation to inﬁnites-
imal perturbations that can be realized in a numerical
study.

In an analytic approach to the question of inﬁnitesimal
stability, one considers the time evolution of the sum of
the soliton under investigation and a small excitation,
δu(x, t) = ψ(x, t). The equation of motion (3) is then
expanded to ﬁrst order in ψ, and expressed in terms of t

It follows that solutions to this (non-Hermitean) equation
can be written as the product of functions ψλ(ξ) and
exp (λt). If one or more of the resulting values of λ has
a positive real part, the corresponding ψλ(x, t) will grow
exponentially with time, and the initial solitonic solution
will be locally unstable. Since it is our aim to detect
precisely such exponential stabilities (if present), it is of
no consequence that the numerical noise introduced by
the ﬁnite mesh size is small. Exponential instabilities will
be apparent if they are present. The ﬁnite size of ∆x also
means that there is a smallest wave length perturbation
which can be studied on the lattice. In practice, potential
instabilities involving such wave lengths will be invisible
to numerical studies only if they are orthogonal to those
wave lengths which can be investigated reliably with the
∆x chosen. While this is not impossible, it is unlikely.

Results were obtained with ∆x = 0.1 and ∆t = 0.001.
The spatial lattice was chosen to be periodic with length
100. For β = β1
0.735, the exact energy of the soliton
is 0.0377. The energy of this initial state is smaller by
10−6 when calculated on the lattice. Energy is not
1.5
strictly conserved by the numerical algorithm adopted
but rather decreases linearly with time over the time in-
tervals considered. In the present case, energy is lost at
10−9 per unit time. We have followed this
the rate of 7.3
soliton for times as long as 1000 units, during which the
soliton can propagate more than 100 times its own width.
The energy loss is negligible, and there is absolutely no
indication of instability. (Note that the discrepancy in
the initial energy is proportional to ∆x2; the rate of en-
ergy loss scales like ∆x3.)

×

We can illustrate soliton stability in the following man-
ner. We ﬁrst determine the location of the maximum of
the soliton as a function of time. The constancy of its
velocity over large time intervals provides an initial in-

dication of the stability of the soliton.
case, this velocity is found to be stable roughly 0.02%
less than the initial velocity of the analytic soliton. (This
error scales with ∆x2.) There are, of course, small ﬂuc-
tuations in the location of both the maximum density
and, hence, the velocity due to the presence of noise. For
the present example, such ﬂuctuations in the location of
the maximum are never greater than 0.004, which is 25
times smaller than ∆x.
(These ﬂuctuations also scale
like ∆x2.) Having identiﬁed the position of soliton as
a function of time, each time frame is shifted to locate
the soliton at a common point. A time-averaged soliton
is then constructed in order to minimize the eﬀects of
noise. The diﬀerence between the time-averaged soliton
and the analytic soliton is shown in Figure 2. The peak
value of the time-averaged soliton is slightly (i.e., roughly
0.05%) higher than that of the analytic soliton, and it is

somewhat narrower than its analytic counterpart. (The
size of these diﬀerences again scales with ∆x2.) This
demonstrates the claim that the analytic solitons are not
identical to solitons on a ﬁnite mesh. Further, the sys-
tematic discrepancy between these two solutions is the
source of and has a magnitude comparable to that of the
noise in the system.

We now consider the nature of the “lattice noise” in
the system as a function of time by subtracting the time
averaged soliton from the full u(x, t) at each time update
and constructing the root mean square of the resulting
noise as a function of time. If the soliton is stable, the
resulting rms noise should be bounded as a function of
time. If the soliton were unstable, however, we would ex-
pect to ﬁnd systematic diﬀerences in the vicinity of the
soliton maximum which are well above noise level and
which grow exponentially with time. The spatial dis-
tribution of noise at later times shows no sign of such
systematic eﬀects, and its magnitude is the same both
near and far from the location of the soliton. The cal-
culated rms noise is shown in Figure 3 as a function of
time. Again, there is no sign of such instabilities. Since
qualitatively similar results are found for other values of
β, we conclude that the solitons of Eq. (3) are stable with
respect to small perturbations.

Soliton genesis

It is also instructive to consider ﬁnite-amplitude distur-
bances and to see how a localized but non-solitonic ini-
tial state evolves with time. To illustrate this, we choose
u(x, 0) to be the minimum width soliton of Eq. (10). In
this case, however, we distort the second initial condi-
tion and choose v(x, 0) =
p βu(x, 0) with p = 0.5.
Thus, the initial ﬁeld is not solitonic. The time evo-
lution shows that this initial pulse “sheds” matter and
changes its shape through the emission of a smaller soli-
ton, which moves in the opposite direction, and small
amplitude waves, which run ahead of the solitons with
velocity β
1. The two solitons are captured in Fig-
ure 4 at t = 50. The velocity of the larger soliton is
β = 0.799 and its maximum is at x = 139.515 whereas
the smaller has β =
0.948 and maximum at x = 52.871.
The shape of each of these solitons is accurately described
using Eq. (10) with the corresponding measured velocity.
These two solitons account for virtually all of the initial
energy of the system; approximately 0.3% of this energy
is associated with the small amplitude motion distinct
from the solitons. In Figure 5 the two solitons have been
subtracted out, and only the diﬀerence is plotted. This
conﬁrms that the shapes are indeed solitonic.

It is also possible to study soliton stability in the pres-
ence of larger amplitude noise. This is most easily done
by choosing a form of u(x, 0) which consists of both the
(analytic) soliton of interest and a linear combination
of the lowest k
K periodic waves on the interval L,
ak sin (2πkx/L + φk), with phases chosen at random and
amplitudes chosen at random subject to a constraint on
the overall rms noise level at t = 0. The analysis pro-
ceeds as above. We have considered the case of K = 10
with an initial rms noise as large as 5% of the maximum
amplitude of the soliton. The results are similar to those
found for small amplitude noise: There are no indications
of soliton instability.

FIG. 4: A minimal width soliton with an initial velocity, β,
50% lower than the corresponding analytic value, shown at
t = 50.
It has divided into two solitons of diﬀerent sizes,
propagating in opposite directions. Small-amplitude waves
run ahead of the solitons with velocity β ≈ 1; the region be-
tween the solitons is essentially noise free. (See also Figure 5).
Note that the length of the periodic lattice has been increased
here to avoid interference eﬀects between the solitons and the
leading small amplitude waves.

Similar results have been obtained for other non-
solitonic initial pulse forms (e.g., Gaussian pulses).
In
short, for the cases explored, non-solitonic initial exci-
tations evolve into solitons and small amplitude non-
solitonic disturbances.
In inﬁnite space, dispersion en-
sures that the solitonic and non-solitonic components will
become spatially distinct and that the amplitude of the

latter will decrease with time. This is obviously not the
case for the periodic lattice considered here.

Solitons and dissipation

It is also possible to consider the consequences of dissi-
pation on soliton propagation. The inclusion of viscosity
in the Navier-Stokes velocity results in an additional term
on the right of Eq. (3) of the form κ∂3u/∂x2∂t. This term
is readily incorporated in our numerical approach by the
inclusion of the term +κ∂v/∂ξ in Eq. (15). We have per-
formed numerical studies with the value κ = 0.05. With
this choice of κ, the height of the soliton is reduced by
roughly 70% at t = 990, has travelled more than 100
times its initial width. As energy is dissipated, the soli-
ton accelerates, and its proﬁle changes with the expected
drop in its amplitude. Over the entire time range con-
sidered, we ﬁnd that the soliton proﬁle is consistent with
the analytic soliton proﬁle of Eq. (10) appropriate for the
corresponding instantaneous velocity of the pulse. This
is illustrated in Figure 6, which shows the comparison of
analytic solitons (in inﬁnite space) and these numerical
results including dissipation at several times.

For several reasons, this agreement is necessarily only
approximate. First, some time is required for the soliton
proﬁle to adjust to the exact form corresponding to its
instantaneous velocity. Obviously, only a limited time
is available for this adjustment in the presence of dissi-
pation. More importantly, the time-independence of the
spatial integral of u is not aﬀected by the inclusion of dis-
sipation. Thus, u(x, t) approaches a constant value for all
x as t
. On a periodic lattice, as here, this constant
is non-zero. This eﬀect is clearly seen in Figure 6, and it
is obviously not included in the analytic form of Eq. (10)
valid in inﬁnite space. Figure 6 shows no indication of
the catastrophic break-up of the soliton into small ampli-
tude waves which might be anticipated in the presence of

the dissipation considered here is large compared to what
is to be expected in biomembranes and nerves, where lit-
tle or no change in pulse shape is observed over distances

CONCLUSIONS

We have considered here a number of tests of the stabil-
ity of the solitons associated with the modiﬁed Boussi-
nesq equation, Eq. (3). After ﬁnding the analytic form
of these solitons, we turned to a numerical investigation
(with periodic boundary conditions) of the their stabil-
ity with respect to various perturbations. These solitons
were found to be stable with respect to the “smallest pos-
sible” perturbations inevitably induced by the ﬁnite size
of the numerical mesh and to ﬁnite but small periodic
perturbations. Solitons are found to be produced by ar-
bitrary localized but non-solitonic initial excitations. Fi-
nally, we have shown that solitons retain their character-
istic properties even in the presence of relatively strong
dissipation. It was argued in Ref. [2] that the measured
compression modulus of lipids of biological membranes
are suitable for the production of solitons.

These ﬁndings may be of immediate relevance for the
propagation of the action potential in nerve axons [2].
The solitons described above are subject to friction and
dissipation. Nerve membranes are not homogeneous,
i.e., they vary both in thickness (e.g., at the site of the
soma) and in the speciﬁc composition of lipids and pro-
teins. Elastic constants may therefore vary locally. In the
present paper we have shown that neither noise nor dis-
sipation aﬀect the propagation of solitary waves as such

but rather lead only to slight changes in amplitude and
velocity. These pulses are therefore likely to be robust
with respect to the unavoidable variance in shape and
composition of biological membranes and to dissipative
hydrodynamic processes which accompany the observed
thickness changes in nerves [6]. Thus, the present results
suggest that a model of nerve pulses as stable solitons is
viable even in a realistic physiological environment and
and that such a model may provide an immediate and re-
liable explanation of associated mechanical [6] and ther-
modynamic [3, 4, 5] eﬀects that remain unexplained in
the presently accepted Hodgkin-Huxley model [1].

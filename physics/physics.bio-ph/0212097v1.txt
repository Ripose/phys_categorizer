Abstract

Our atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal the existence of

bound and free water molecules in the hydration layer of an aqueous

micelle. The bound water molecules can be either singly or doubly hy-

drogen bonded to the polar head group on the surface of the micelle. The

ratio of bound to free water is found to be approximately equal to 9:1 at

300 K.

1 Introduction

Water inevitably present at the surface of biological macromolecules and self-organized

assemblies plays a critical role in the structure, stability and function of these sys-

tems [1, 2]. However, the layer of water that surrounds these systems is rather thin,

typically 1-3 layers thick. Thus, the study of hydration layer has turned out to be

rather diﬃcult. Dielectric relaxation studies measure the collective response of the

whole system and, therefore, are not a sensitive probe of the dynamics of the hydra-

tion water. NMR techniques (NOE and NMRD) have the required spatial resolution

but lack the dynamic resolution. Neutron scattering techniques are beginning to be

applied to study the dynamics of hydration layer in these systems [3]. Solvation

dynamics may be a reasonably good probe because it can have both the temporal

and spatial resolution [4, 5, 6], yet it provides only a collective response. In this

circumstance, computer simulation can play a very important role in understanding

the nature of the hydration water.

As the hydration layer is spatially heterogeneous even on a molecular length

scale and because the microscopic interactions are quite complex, a purely analytical

study of this system is prohibitively diﬃcult. In order to capture some of the basic

physics of the dynamics in such systems, a model in terms of a dynamic exchange

between bound and free water molecules [7] has been proposed. The bound water

molecules are those which are singly or doubly hydrogen bonded to the protein or to

the surface of a self assembled aggregate while the free water molecules are not. The

microscopic dynamical event is an exchange between these two states of water within

the hydration layer. The model predicts the emergence of a slow decay when the

binding energy is high. In this limit, the time constant of the slow decay is just the

inverse of the rate of bound to free transition[7]. Although this model has been semi-

quantitatively successful in explaining wide range of behavior, the basic assumption

2

of the existence of bound and free water molecules remained unsubstantiated.

In addition to the above, bound and free water molecules give a convenient way

to categorize the water molecules in the hydration layer. The bound molecules

can be further sub-divided into two categories – singly hydrogen bonded or doubly

hydrogen bonded. We shall denote these two by IBW1 and IBW2, respectively. Free

water molecules are denoted by IFW (interfacial free water).

Recently, we have presented several studies aimed at understanding various as-

pects of interfacial water [8]. These studies were based on detailed atomistic molec-

ular dynamics (MD) simulations of an anionic micelle, CsPFO (Cesium pentaﬂu-

orooctanoate). These studies have conﬁrmed the existence of slow water and ion

dynamics in the interfacial region. We have also studied the lifetime of hydrogen

bonds that the water molecules form with the micellar polar head groups (PHG) and

found that it becomes considerably longer than that between two water molecules

in the bulk.

In the present work, we have extended our previous study to investigate in detail,

the equilibrium structure of the interfacial water. Our study has clearly revealed (we

believe for the ﬁrst time) that the water at the interface of CsPFO consists of three

diﬀerent species – IBW2, IBW1 and IFW, in the ratio, 1.1:8:0.9, i.e., the bound to

free water ratio is 9:1. This large ratio is a signature of the highly polar character

of the anionic micelle.

2 Results

As the details of the simulation have been discussed elsewhere [8], we directly proceed

to the discussion of the results. Figure 1 illustrates the average geometries adopted

by IBW1 and IBW2 water species. The ﬁgure is not just an illustration – we have

given all the details about average bond lengths and the bond angles calculated from

3

the simulation. There are features which are absent in IBW1 but present in IBW2,

such as a well-deﬁned distance between the water and the second (non-bonded)

oxygen of the polar head group. This feature at 4.7˚A is prominent for IBW2 water

molecules but absent for IBW1. An examination of the full distribution of bond

lengths and bond angles, and not just their averages, show that the environment

around bound water species is, in general, more well deﬁned relative a water molecule

in pure water.

In ﬁgure 2 we present the monomer energy distribution, for all the three species,

as also for water molecules in the bulk. It is seen that the interfacial water molecules

have peaks at lower energies – the doubly bonded species (IBW2) have the lowest

potential energy. It is also worth noting that the bound water molecules have con-

siderably lower energy values than the the free water molecules. It is this enhanced

stability which makes the bound species identiﬁable, even when they are transient

because of the dynamic exchange between the free and bound species. A large

part of this stabilisation comes from the stronger hydrogen bonds that bound water

molecules form with the surfactant head groups.

In ﬁgure 3 we provide a schematic of the free energies of the three species, cal-

culated from their average concentrations. Despite the reduced monomer energy

arising out of two water-headgroup hydrogen bonds, the IBW2 state is less stable

than the IBW1 state due to entropic considerations (less number of suitable conﬁg-

urations). The reversible reactions between these states of water on such a surface

should determine the dynamical response of interfacial water.

Note that ﬁgure 3 describes the free energy and not the binding energy of the

three species. The binding energy can be inferred from ﬁgure 2. The total binding

energy of the IBW2 species is indeed larger than IBW1.

3 Conclusions

In conclusion we note that the existence of identiﬁable bound and free water molecules

on the surface can indeed help in developing a phenomenological description of dy-

namics of water at complex interfaces. The 9:1 ratio obtained (for IBW and IFW)

is expected to be typical for ionic micelles. However, this ratio is bound to decrease

substantially for proteins due to the existence of hydrophobic and less polar amino

acid groups in its surface. The water on the protein/membrane surface is expected to

play a critical role in the molecular recognition of hydrophobic patches by incoming

ligands or drug molecules. Work in this direction is under progress.

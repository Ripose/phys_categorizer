The SIRM (Stochastic Inclined Rods Model) proposed by H. Matsuura

and M. Nakano can explain the muscle’s motion perfectly, but the inter-

molecular potential between myosin head and G-actin is too simple and

only repulsive potential is considered.

In this paper we study the SIRM

with diﬀerent complex potential and discuss the eﬀect of the spring on the

system. The calculation results show that the spring, the eﬀective radius of

the G-actin and the intermolecular potential play key roles in the motion.
The sliding speed is about 4.7 × 10−6m/s calculated from the model which

well agrees with the experimental data.

Key words: SIRM, Intermolecular potential, Actin myosin system.

I. INTRODUCTION

The great progress have been made on the observations of molecular motor since

H. F. Huxley and H. E. Huxley [1] [2] [3] proposed the rotating cross-bridge model to

study muscular mobility in 1954. More and more biologists and theoretical biophysicists

concentrate on studying the mechanism of the living system and mincing the biological

structure to invent subtle artiﬁcial instrument. Based on diﬀerent system, three diﬀerent

families of motor proteins have been identiﬁed [4] [5] [6], Kinesins and dyneins move along

tubulin ﬁlaments [7], myosin move along actin ﬁlaments [8] [9].The motion mechanism of

the three kinds of motors can be described as follows [4] [10] [11]: ﬁrstly, the motor

binds Adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), then hydrolyzes the bound ATP and absorbs the

energy, subsequently, the motor releases the products Adenosinediphosphate (ADP) and

Phosphate (P), so the motor move constantly within the chemical cycle. The molecular

motors play a key role in transuding chemical energy into mechanical work at a molecular

scale. Up to date there have been three kinds of archetype models proposed to study the

molecular motor system: namely the ﬂuctuation models, the phase transition models and

the resonance models.

One archetype ﬂuctuation model is ratchets model. This model looks molecular motors

as heavily damped Brownian particles and the model explains the molecular motor’s

motion by studying a single particle in a potential inspired by Feynman’s ratchet. M. O.

Magnasco [12] and R. D. Astumian [13] [25] have proposed the forced thermal ratchets

model, the ﬂuctuant force break the symmetry of the system, so that the system can

absorb the energy from the surroundings, the motor undergoes similar Brownian motion

and produces net transport. Although the ﬂuctuation models have discussed diﬀerent

aspects of molecular motors, there still exits a matter of debate on the mechanism of its

motion.

The second typical model is phase transition model: the two state model proposed by

F.Julicher [4] and isothermal ratchet model proposed by A. Pameggiani [14]. Using the

basic idea of the Ising model for phase transitions, they have studied a single motor or

many motors moving in asymmetry periodic potential. In these models the microtubule

and molecular motor are treated as periodic polar railway tracks and carnot engines with

cargoes, the motor consumes chemical energy and causes the system conformation change,

so the phase transition occurs between two states. The models give a good explanation

on the eﬃciency of the motor.

The newly type resonance model is named the Stochastic Inclined Rods Model (SIRM)

proposed by H. Matsuura and H. Matsuura [?], in the model the energy of motion was

supplied from the random noise and the system always moves to one direction by using

stochastic resonance. The movement of the system does not break the second law of

thermodynamics, because the actin-myosin system is open to the surroundings and the

energy ﬂows in from their surroundings. The SIRM presents a perfectly sliding mechanism

of the actin-myosin system, but the interaction is too simple and only repulsive force is

2

considered. The main aim of our paper is that based on SIRM we study muscle’s motion

under a complex intermolecular potential and discuss the eﬀect of the spring on the

system.

II. MODEL AND FORMALISM

In order to describe the motion of actin-myosin system, we simulate it by a mechan-

ical model as shown in Fig. 1. SIRM is composed of three parts: an inclined spring, a

myosin head and myosin bundle. Our model proposed a microscopic mechanism for the

actin-myosin system: The random noise is from the water molecules generated through

the heat energy of ATP hydrolysis. ATP supplies the heat energy and provides heat

energy to the surrounding water molecules, which accelerates the movement of the water

molecules, So the random noise (the water molecules) can interact with the myosin head,

and the resonance occurs between the myosin head and the noise, then it collides with

a G-actin and obliquely kicks the G-actin sphere, because the direction of vibration is

inclined against the line of the actin ﬁbers, myosin molecules obtain the propellant force

along the direction of the ﬁber and the myosin can move to one direction.

Let us set up the dynamic equations of the system. As for the intermolecular potential

between myosin head and G-actin we adopt Jennard-Jones potential:

Where ri = q(x − xi)2 + (y − yi)2 − R, (xi, yi) means a center of i-th G-actin glove,

and R is its eﬀective radius. p, q, U 0

a , jk are the parameters of the potential.

The potential of the myosin rod is approximately expressed as follows:

Us = Klexp(−q(x − x2)2 + (y − y2)2 + L)
+Klexp(q(x − x2)2 + (y − y2)2 − L)
Kθ(θ − θ0)2.

Where Kθ, Kl are tangent constant and radial constant of the spring, and L is initial

length of the spring , tan(θ) = (x2−x)

y

, θ, θ0 are current angle and initial angle between the

rod and level axis. (x2, y2)is the center of gravity of myosin bundle.

The equations of the myosin head are:

∂t2 = −∂(Ua + Us)

∂t2 = −∂Us

+ Fx2(t) − η

.

With regard to the center of gravity (x2, y2) of the ﬁlament, we set a similar equation:

The variable y2 is ﬁxed since the myosin ﬁlament does not signiﬁcantly move along the

y-direction compared to the x-direction.

Where α, β, η are viscous constants, M is the mass of the myosin bundle and m is

the mass of the myosin head. Fx(t), Fy(t), Fx2(t) are ﬂuctuation of the thermal noise, the

noise is Gauss white noise and it satisﬁes the following ﬂuctuation-dissipative relations

[21] [22] [23].

< Fa(t) >= 0.

< Fa(t)Fb(s) >= 2kBT ζδa,bδ(t − s).

where a, b = x, y, x2; ζ = α, β, η; kB is Boltzmann constant. T is absolute temperature,

t, s are time.

We solve the equations(1)-(7) with a numerical method and the numerical results are

shown in Fig.2-Fig.6.

The dashed line shows the position of myosin ﬁlament and the solid line describes the

displacement of myosin head. From the ﬁgure we can know that the head and the ﬁl-

ament, bound by the spring, move forward along the same direction as a whole. The

movement of the head is a translational one as a whole, though the trace has irregularity

and randomness like Brownian particles. We can know from the ﬁgure the average gliding
speed of the myosin bundle is 4.7 × 10−6m/s, On the other hand, the experimental data
is that the maximum gliding speed is 7 × 10−6m/s. It is impressive

by Yanagida et al.

that our prediction well agree with the experimental data.

The solid line shows the stretching motion of the myosin rod, the vertical displacement

of myosin head is described with the dashed line. The ﬁgure shows that the collision

between the G-actin and the myosin head distorts their relative motion from a trigono-

metric function. This trace of the motion is given by an accurate trigonometric function

if there are no interactions or the collisions. Truly the strain of the trigonometric function

indicates that the myosin head kicks obliquely the G-actin when the spring is stretched

by the resonance vibration.

From the ﬁgure we can know that the constant of the spring play a key role in the mo-

tion, if the constant is zero, the system can not move. And if the constant increases, the

velocity of the SIRM will increase rapidly.

The ﬁgure can show that the eﬀective radius of the G-actin is important for the system

to move. If the G-actin is ﬂat (R = 0) the SIRM cannot move, on the other hand, if the

eﬀective radius of the G-actin is too big (R = 4nm) the system cannot move, either. The

system can move at the highest speed at R = 2.5nm.

From the ﬁgure we can know that the repulsive potential can accelerate the system’s mo-

tion and the potential between the G-actin and myosin can decide the motion’s velocity.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Based on the SIRM we study the movement of actin-myosin system with a Jennard-

Jones potential. From the numerical results we can know there is relative sliding motion
between the ﬁlament and the G-actin and the average gliding speed is 4.7 × 10−6m/s

which well agree with the experimental data. When the system absorbs the energy from

the thermal noise constantly through stochastic resonance, the intermolecular potential

and the inclined rod make the ﬁlament move to one direction. The system can convert

the random noise to one directional motion. The eﬀective radius of G-actin, the constant

of the spring and the intermolecular potential are important for the system to move. If

the constant of the spring is small, the system cannot move, and if the eﬀective radius of

G-actin is too small or too big the system cannot move, either. The repulsive potential

makes the system move fast. From the results we can predict the state of the muscle:

if the constant of the spring or the eﬀective radius of G-actin become small, the SIRM

can not move at all and muscle is fatigue, if the eﬀective radius of G-actin is too big, the

velocity of the system is zero and the actin-myosin system may be breakdown.

SIRM is thermally open to the outer surroundings and it has a outer heat source of

ATP. The heat or energy consumed by SIRM is directly supplied from the surroundings

(i.e. the thermal motions of water molecules). The entropy always increases since the

ﬂow is positive, therefore, the system does not break the second law of thermodynamics.

There have been many discussions on the movement of ratchets in a heat bath. Among

them, we only consider one famous discussion of Feynman [24]. Feynman showed from

statistical discussions that the ratchets under an isothermal temperature cannot turn as a

total since the ratchets turn to both sides with equal probability. However, he also showed

in the same section, 46-2, of Ref. [24] that it can turn to one side if a load is suspended

from the one side even in an isothermal bath. Our model can work even under isothermal

temperature conditions, since it has a load, which is an intermolecular potential of the

G-actin fastened to a Z-membrane.

Noise in dynamical systems is usually considered a nuisance. But in certain nonlinear

systems including electronic circuits and biological sensory apparatus the presence of noise

can in fact enhance the detection of the weak signals. From the above results, we point

out the possibility that the actin-myosin system can use thermal noise around for the

movement in similar way. This viewpoint is completely new as the traditional viewpoint

thinks the water disturbs the motion as viscosity.

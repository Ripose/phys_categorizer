We discuss a two-dimensional model for the dynamics of
axonemal deformations driven by internally generated forces
of molecular motors. Our model consists of an elastic ﬁlament
pair connected by active elements. We derive the dynamic
equations for this system in presence of internal forces.
In
the limit of small deformations, a perturbative approach al-
lows us to calculate ﬁlament shapes and the tension proﬁle.
We demonstrate that periodic ﬁlament motion can be gener-
ated via a self-organization of elastic ﬁlaments and molecular
motors. Oscillatory motion and the propagation of bending
waves can occur for an initially non-moving state via an in-
stability termed Hopf bifurcation. Close to this instability,
the behavior of the system is shown to be independent of
microscopic details of the axoneme and the force-generating
mechanism. The oscillation frequency however does depend
on properties of the molecular motors. We calculate the oscil-
lation frequency at the bifurcation point and show that a large
frequency range is accessible by varying the axonemal length
between 1 and 50µm. We calculate the velocity of swimming
of a ﬂagellum and discuss the eﬀects of boundary conditions
and externally applied forces on the axonemal oscillations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Many small organisms and cells swim in a viscous en-
vironment using the active motion of cilia and ﬂagella.
These are hair-like appendages of the cell which can un-
dergo periodic motion and use hydrodynamic friction to
induce cellular self-propulsion (Bray 1992). In this paper,
we are interested in those ﬂagella and cilia which con-
tain force generating elements integrated along the whole
length of the elastic ﬁlamentous structure. They repre-
sent rod-like elastic structures which move and bend as a
result of internal stresses. Examples for these systems are
paramecium which has a large number of cilia on its sur-
face; sperm, which use a single ﬂagellum to swim; and
chlamydomonas which uses two ﬂagella to swim (Bray
1992). Cilia also occur in very diﬀerent situations. An
example is the kinocilium which exists in many hair bun-
dles of mechanosensitive cells and has the ability to beat
periodically (R¨usch and Thurm 1990).

The common structural theme of cilia and ﬂagella is
the axoneme, a characteristic structure which occurs in
a large number of very diﬀerent organisms and cells and
which appeared early in evolution. The axoneme consists
of a cylindrical arrangement of 9 doublets of parallel mi-
crotubules and one pair of microtubules in the center.

In addition, it contains a large number of other proteins
such as nexin which provide elastic links between micro-
tubule doublets, see Fig. 1. The axoneme is inherently
active. A large number of dynein molecular motors are
located in two rows between neighboring microtubules
and can induce forces and local displacements between
adjacent microtubules (Albert et al. 1994).

Axonemal ﬂagella can generate periodic waving or
beating patterns of motion. In the case of sperm for ex-
ample, a bending wave of the ﬂagellum propagates from
the head which contains the chromosomes towards the
tail. In a viscous environment, the surrounding ﬂuid is
set in motion and hydrodynamic forces act on the ﬁla-
ment. For typical values of frequencies and length scales
given by the size of a ﬂagellum, the Reynolds number
is small and inertia terms in the ﬂuid hydrodynamics
can be neglected (Taylor 1951). Therefore, only friction
forces resulting from solvent viscosity can contribute to
propulsion. Under such conditions self-propulsion is pos-
sible if a wave propagates towards one end, a situation
which breaks time-reversal invariance of the sequence of
deformations of the ﬂagellum (Purcell 1977).

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of the cross-section of the
axoneme. Nine doublets of microtubules (M) are arranged in
a cylindrical fashion, two microtubules are located in the cen-
ter. Dynein motors (D) are attached to microtubule doublets
and interact with a neighboring doublet. Elastic elements (N)
such as nexin are indicated as springs.

How can bending waves be generated by axone-
mal dyneins which act internally within the axoneme?
Dynein molecular motors induce relative forces between
parallel elastic ﬁlaments, which are microtubule doublets.
As a result of these forces, the ﬁlaments have the ten-
dency to slide with respect to each other. If such a slid-

1

ing is permitted globally, the ﬁlaments simply separate
but no bending occurs. Bending results if global sliding
is suppressed by rigidly connecting the ﬁlament pair in
the region close to one of the two ends. In this situation,
sliding is still possible locally, however only if the ﬁla-
ments undergo a bending deformation. This coupling of
axonemal bending to local microtubule sliding has been
demonstrated experimentally. In situations where the ax-
oneme is cut at its basal end, ﬁlaments slide and in the
presence of ATP separate without bending (Warner and
Mitchell 1981). Small gold-beads speciﬁcally attached to
microtubules in fully functioning ﬂagella can be used to
directly visualize the local relative sliding during beating
(Brokaw 1991).

The theoretical problem of oscillatory axonemal bend-
ing and wave patterns have been addressed by several
authors. One can distinguish two principally diﬀerent
mechanisms to generate oscillatory forces within the ax-
oneme: (i) Deterministic forcing: a chemical oscillator
could regulate the dynein motors which are activated
and deactivated periodically.
In this case, the regula-
tory system deﬁnes a dynamical force-pattern along the
axoneme and drives the system in a deterministic way
(Sugino and Naitoh 1982).
(ii) Self-organized beating:
the axoneme oscillates spontaneously as a result of the
interplay of force-generating elements and the elastic ﬁl-
aments (Machin 1963, Brokaw 1975, Brokaw 1985, Lin-
demann and Kanous 1995).
In particular, Brokaw has
studied thoroughly self-organized patterns of beating
using numerical simulations of simple models (Brokaw
1985, Brokaw 1999). Such models are based on the bend-
ing elasticity of the ﬂagellum and an assumption on the
coupling of motor activity to the ﬂagellar deformations.
In the present work, we are mostly interested in self-
organized beating. Our approach is conceptually diﬀer-
ent from other works as we focus on an oscillating insta-
bility of the motor-ﬁlament system. In general, sponta-
neous oscillations occur via a so-called Hopf-bifurcation
where an initially stable quiescent state becomes unsta-
ble and starts to oscillate. There is evidence for the
existence of such a dynamic instability in the axoneme.
Demembranated ﬂagella show a behavior which depends
on the ATP-concentration CAT P in the solution. For
small CATP, the ﬂagellum is straight and not moving. If
CATP is increased, oscillatory motion sets in at a critical
value of the ATP concentration and persists for larger
concentrations (Gibbons 1975). This implies an instabil-
ity of the initial straight state with respect to a wave-like
mode. Recently, it has been demonstrated using a sim-
ple model for molecular motors that a large number of
motors working against an elastic element can generate
oscillations via a Hopf bifurcation by a generic mecha-
nism (J¨ulicher and Prost 1995, J¨ulicher and Prost 1997).
This suggests that a system consisting only of molecu-
lar motors and semiﬂexible ﬁlaments can in general un-
dergo self-organized oscillations. This idea is supported

by the facts that ﬂagellar dyneins are capable of gener-
ating oscillatory motion (Shingyoji et al. 1998) and that
experiments suggest the existence of dynamic transitions
in many-motor systems (Riveline et al. 1998, Fujita and
Ishiwata 1998). Patterns of motion of cilia and ﬂag-
ella can be complex and embedded in three dimensional
space. Many examples of propagating bending waves,
however, are planar and can thus be considered as con-
ﬁned to two-dimensions (Brokaw 1991).

In the following sections, we present a systematic study
of a simpliﬁed model for the axoneme which has been in-
troduced recently (Camalet et al. 1999) and which cap-
tures the basic physical properties that are relevant for
its dynamics. In Section II, we present a thorough anal-
ysis of the dynamics of ﬂexible ﬁlaments driven by in-
ternal forces. This work is inspired by recent studies
of the dynamics of semiﬂexible ﬁlaments subject to ex-
ternal forces (Goldstein and Langer 1995, Wiggins and
Goldstein 1998, Wiggins et al. 1998). We show how the
dynamic equations can be solved perturbatively and we
calculate the shapes of bending waves, the velocity of
swimming and the tension proﬁle along the ﬂagellum. In
Section III, we brieﬂy review a simple two-state model
for a large number of coupled molecular motors. This
model is well suited to represent the dynein molecular
motors which act within the axoneme. Self-organized
bending waves and oscillations via a Hopf bifurcation of
the coupled motor-ﬁlament system are studied in section
IV. We calculate the wave-patterns close to a Hopf bi-
furcation and determine the frequencies selected by the
system. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our simple
model to real axonemal cilia and ﬂagella and propose ex-
periments which could be performed to test predictions
that follow from our work.

II. A SIMPLE MODEL FOR AXONEMAL

DYNAMICS

The cylindrical arrangement of microtubule doublets
within the axoneme can be modeled eﬀectively as an
elastic rod. Deformations of this rod lead to local slid-
ing displacements of neighboring microtubules. Here, we
consider planar deformations. In this case, the geomet-
ric coupling of bending and sliding can be captured by
considering two elastic ﬁlaments (corresponding to two
microtubule doublets) arranged in parallel with constant
separation a along the whole length of the rod. At one
end, which corresponds to the basal end of an axoneme
and which we call “head”, the two ﬁlaments are rigidly
attached and not permitted to slide with respect to each
other. Everywhere else, sliding is possible, see Fig. 2.
The conﬁgurations of the system are described by the
shape of the ﬁlament pair given by the position of the
neutral line r(s) as a function of the arclength s, where

2

r is a point in two dimensional space. The shapes of the
two ﬁlaments are then given by

Therefore,

r1(s) = r(s) − a n(s)/2
r2(s) = r(s) + a n(s)/2

,

(1)

where n with n2 = 1 is the ﬁlament normal. The local
geometry along the ﬁlament pair is characterized by the
relations

B. Enthalpy functional

The bending elasticity of ﬁlaments (microtubules)
characterizes the energetics of the ﬁlament pair. In ad-
dition to ﬁlament bending, we also have to take into ac-
count the large number of passive and active elements
(e.g. nexin links and dynein molecular motors) which
give rise to relative forces between neighboring micro-
tubule doublets. These internal forces can be charac-
terized by a coarse-grained description deﬁning the force
per unit length f (s) acting at position s in opposite direc-
tions on the two microtubules, see Fig. 2 (internal forces
must balance). This force density is assumed to arise as
the sum of active and passive forces generated by a large
number of proteins. This internal force density corre-
sponds to a shear stress within the ﬂagellum which tends
to slide the two ﬁlaments with respect to each other. A
static conﬁguration of a ﬁlament pair of length L can
thus be characterized by the enthalpy functional

Here, κ denotes the total bending rigidity of the ﬁla-
ments. The incompressibility of the system is taken into
account by the Lagrange multiplier function Λ(s) which is
used to enforce the constraint ˙r2 = 1 which ensures that
s is the arclength (Goldstein and Langer 1995). The in-
ternal force density f couples to the sliding displacement

∆ as described by the contribution R dsf ∆. The varia-

tion of this term under small deformations of the ﬁlament
shape represents the work performed by internal stresses.
Using Eq. (7) leads after a partial integration to

The two ﬁlaments are assumed to be incompressible
and rigidly attached to each other at one end where s = 0.
Bending of the ﬁlament pair and local sliding displace-
ments are then coupled by a geometric constraint. The
sliding displacement at position s along the neutral line

where

is deﬁned to be the diﬀerence of the total arclengths along
the two ﬁlaments up to the points r1(s) and r2(s) which
face each other along the neutral line. From Eqns. (1)
and (4) follows that ˙r1,2 = (1 ± aC/2)t and thus

|˙r1,2| = 1 ± aC/2 .

is the force density integrated to the tail. From Eq.(9)
it follows that if the internal stresses or F are imposed,
G is minimized for a ﬁlament curvature C = C0 where
C0(s) = aF (s)/κ is a local spontaneous curvature. The
internal forces therefore induce ﬁlament bending. In or-
der to derive the ﬁlament dynamics, we determine the
variation δG with respect to variations δr. Details of

(13)

where Fext (L) is the external force applied at the end
which satisﬁes Eq.

component of the integrated forces acting on the ﬁlament.

C. Dynamic equations

We derive the dynamic equation with the simplifying
assumption that the hydrodynamics of the surrounding
ﬂuid can be described by two local friction coeﬃcients ξk
and ξ⊥ for tangential and normal motion, respectively.
The equations of motion in this case are given by (Wig-
gins and Goldstein 1998, Wiggins et al. 1998)

For the following, it is useful to introduce a coordinate

D. Boundary Conditions

The ﬁlament dynamics depends on the imposed bound-
ary conditions. The variation δG has contributions at
the boundaries which can be interpreted as externally
applied forces Fext and torques Text acting at the ends,
see Appendix A. At the head with s = 0,

Fext = (κ ˙C − af )n − τ t

(20)

If constraints on the positions and/or angles are imposed
at the ends, forces and torques have to be applied to
satisfy these constraints. In the following, we will discuss
diﬀerent boundary conditions as speciﬁed in Table I:

Case A is the situation of a ﬁlament with clamped
head, i.e. both the tangent and the position at the head
are ﬁxed, the tail is free. Case B is a ﬁlament with ﬁxed
head, i.e. the tangent at the head can vary. The situation
of a swimming sperm corresponds to case C where the
friction force of a viscous load attached at the head is
taken into account, the head is otherwise free. As an
example of a situation with an external force Fext(L)
applied at the tail we consider Case D. For simplicity, we
assume a force parallel to the (ﬁxed) tangent at the head.

E. Small deformations

The boundary conditions for h(s) are given in table II.

In the absence of internal forces f , the ﬁlament relaxes
passively to a straight rod with ˙ψ = 0, i.e. ψ constant.
Without loss of generality, we choose ψ = 0 in this state
which implies that straight ﬁlament is parallel to the X-
axis. Internal stresses f (s) induce deformations of this
straight conformation. For small internal stresses, we can
perform a systematic expansion of the ﬁlament dynamics
in powers of the stress amplitude.

We introduce a dimensionless parameter ǫ which scales
the amplitudes of the internal stresses, f (s, t) = ǫf1(s, t),
where f1 is an arbitrary stress distribution. We can now
solve the dynamic equations (16) and (17) perturbatively
by writing

ψ = ǫψ1 + ǫ2ψ2 + O(ǫ3)
τ = τ0 + ǫτ1 + ǫ2τ2 + O(ǫ3)

,

(21)

which allows us to determine the coeﬃcients ψn(s, t) and
τn(s, t). This procedure is described in Appendix B. We
ﬁnd that ψ2 and τ1 always vanish and τ0 = σ is a con-
stant tension which is equal to the X-component of the
external force applied at the end. Note, that for bound-
ary conditions A-C, σ = 0. The ﬁlament shape is thus
characterized by the behavior of ψ1(s, t) which obeys

The velocity of swimming ¯v can be calculated pertur-
batively in ǫ. We consider for simplicity periodic internal
stresses with frequency ω given by1

(23)

which is independent of s. This velocity is diﬀerent from
zero only in the case of boundary condition C. We choose
the X-axis parallel to ¯v and introduce a coordinate sys-
tem (x, y) which moves with the ﬁlament

(x, y) = (X − ¯vt, Y )

,

(24)

where ¯v = ±|¯v| and the sign depends on whether motion
is towards the positive or negative X-direction, see Fig.
3. It is useful to introduce the transverse and longitudinal
deformations h and u, respectively, which satisfy

(x, y) = (s + u(s), h(s))

(25)

and which vanish for ǫ = 0. The quantities h, u and ¯v
can be calculated perturbatively in ǫ, see Appendix B.
To second order in ǫ transverse motion satisﬁes

work on swimming (Taylor 1951, Purcell 1977, Stone and

III. INTERNAL FORCES GENERATED BY

MOLECULAR MOTORS

The ﬁlament dynamics is driven by internal stresses
f (s, t) generated by a large number of dynein motors and
passive elements. We describe the properties of a force-
generating system using a simpliﬁed two-state model.

A. Two state model for molecular motors

We brieﬂy review the two-state model for a large num-
ber of motor molecules attached to a ﬁlament which slides
with respect to a second ﬁlament (J¨ulicher and Prost
1995, J¨ulicher et al. 1997). Each motor is assumed to
have two diﬀerent chemical states, a strongly bound state
1 and a weakly bound state or detached state 2. The
interaction between a motor and a ﬁlament in states 1
and 2 is characterized by energy landscapes W1(x) and
W2(x), where x denotes the position of a motor along the
ﬁlament. The potentials reﬂect the symmetry of the ﬁla-
ments: they are periodic with period l, Wi(x) = Wi(x+l)
and are spatially asymmetric, Wi(x) 6= Wi(−x). In the
presence of ATP which is the chemical fuel that drives
the system, the motors are assumed to undergo transi-
tions between states. The corresponding transition rates
are denoted ω1 for detachments and ω2 for attachments.
We introduce the relative position ξ of a motor with re-
spect to the potential period where x = ξ + nl, 0 ≤ ξ < l
and n is an integer. The probability to ﬁnd a motor in
state i at position ξ at time t is denoted Pi(ξ, t), P1 + P2
is normalized within one period. The dynamic equations
of the system are given by

elements such as nexins. If motors have an incommensu-
rate arrangement compared to the ﬁlament periodicity,
P1 + P2 = 1/l and the equations simplify and can be
expressed by P1 alone

B. Molecular motors coupled to a ﬁlament pair

The two state model for a large number of motors is
well suited to represent the internal forces acting within
the axoneme. We assume that at any position s an inde-
pendent two-state model described by Eq. (35) is located
which generates the internal force density f (s). The ﬁl-
ament sliding displacement is identiﬁed with the motor
displacement, ∆ ≡ x. Note, that here we neglect for sim-
plicity ﬂuctuations which arise from the chemical activity
of a ﬁnite number of force generators and we assume ho-
mogeneity of all properties along the axonemal length.
The energy source of the active system is the chemical
activity characterized by the transition rates ω1 and ω2,
the generated forces induce bending deformations of the
ﬁlaments.

The dynamic equations (35) represent a nonlinear ac-
tive system which generates time-dependent forces. Since
we will study periodic motion, we can express forces and
displacements by a Fourier expansion

The interaction of the motors with the two ﬁlaments
is asymmetric. Motors are rigidly connected to one of
the ﬁlaments and slide along the second.
In addition,
the ﬁlaments are polar and ﬁlament sliding is induced by
motors towards one particular end of the two ﬁlaments.
As a consequence, the system has a natural tendency to
create bending deformations with one particular sign of
the curvature. Exchanging the role of the two ﬁlaments
reverses this sign of bending deformations. This broken
symmetry does however not reﬂect the symmetry of the
axoneme which is symmetric with respect to all micro-
tubule doublets. Each of the nine microtubule doublet
within the cylindrical arrangement of the axoneme play
identical roles and interact with rigidly attached motors
as well as with motors which slide along their surfaces. If
all motors generate a constant force, there is consequently
no resulting bending deformation since all bending mo-
ments cancel by symmetry.

and symmetric

In order to introduce this axonemal symmetry in our
two-dimensional model, we assume that both ﬁlaments
have motors which are rigidly attached and which slide
on the second ﬁlament, see Fig. 6. The consequence
of this symmetry is that the ﬁlament polarity becomes
unimportant. Exchanging the role of the two ﬁlaments
is equivalent to replacing the sliding displacement ∆ of
motors by −∆. Therefore, in the context of the two-state
model this symmetrization is equivalent to the require-
ment that energy landscapes Wi(x) and transition rates

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
ωi(x) are symmetric functions with respect to x → −x.
As a consequence of this symmetry, there is no preferred
direction of bending.

choice of a symmetric motor/ﬁlament pair. If we use the
expansion given in Eq. (38), this symmetry implies that
all even coeﬃcients F (2n) = 0.

chemical rates of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. In an exper-
imental situation, it could be varied e.g. by changing the
ATP concentration.
If the molecular motors are regu-
lated by some other ion concentration such as e.g. Ca2+,
this concentration could also play the role of the control
parameter.

D. Linear response function

A. Generic aspects

The perturbative treatment to study small ﬁlament de-
formations introduced in section II can be naturally ex-
tended to the coupled motor-ﬁlament situation using the
expansion (38). Up to second order in ǫ, only the lin-
ear response coeﬃcient of the active system plays a role
which for the two-state model is given by F (1)
nk = χδnk
with

χ = K + λiω − ρZ l

0

dξ ∂ξ∆W

∂ξR

α + iω

iω .

(39)

Here, we have introduced R ≡ ω2/αl and α = ω1 + ω2.
Higher order terms F (2n+1) have to be taken into account
if the third or higher order in ǫ is considered. The linear
response function χ as well as nonlinear coeﬃcients can
be calculated most easily for a simple choice of symmetric
potential and transition rates

∆W (ξ) = U cos(2πξ/l)

ω1(ξ) = β − β cos(2πξ/l)
ω2(ξ) = α − β + β cos(2πξ/l)

(40)

where α and β are ξ-independent rate constants. For this
convenient choice

χ(Ω, ω) = K + iλω − ρkΩ

iω/α + (ω/α)2

,

(41)

where k ≡ U/l2 is the cross-bridge elasticity of the mo-
tors. We have introduced the dimensionless parameter
Ω = 2π2β/α with 0 < Ω < π2 which plays the role of
a control parameter of the motor-ﬁlament system, α is a
characteristic ATP cycling rate.

IV. SELF-ORGANIZED BEATING VIA A HOPF

BIFURCATION

A Hopf-bifurcation is an oscillating instability of an ini-
tial non-oscillating state which occurs for a critical value
Ωc of a control parameter. For Ω < Ωc, the system is
passive and not moving, while for Ω > Ωc it exhibits
spontaneous oscillations. As we demonstrate below, self-
organized oscillations of the driven ﬁlament pair are a
natural consequence of its physical properties. The con-
trol parameter Ω is in our two-state model a ratio of

For oscillations in the vicinity of a Hopf-bifurcation,
ﬁlament deformations are small and we can thus use Eq.
(26) to describe the ﬁlament dynamics. The force ampli-
tude ˜f can be obtained from the expansion

˜f = χ(Ω, ω) ˜∆ + O( ˜∆3)

(42)

in the amplitude of sliding displacements. In addition,
this amplitude is related to the ﬁlament shape:

∆(s) = a(∂sh(s) − ∂sh(0)) + O(h3)

.

(43)

With Eq.
(30), we ﬁnd that spontaneously oscillating
modes ˜h(s) at frequency ω are to linear order near the
bifurcation solutions to

κ∂4
s

˜h − σ∂2
s

˜h + ξ⊥iω˜h = a2χ∂2
s

˜h

(44)

Note that this equation is general and its structure does
not depend on the speciﬁc model chosen for the force
generating elements. Boundary conditions corresponding
to cases A-D follow from Table II by replacing h → ˜h,
∂th → iω˜h and f → ˜f = aχ(∂s˜h − ∂s˜h(0)).

As discussed in Appendix D, Eq. (44) has the struc-
ture of an eigenvalue problem, with χ playing the role
of a complex eigenvalue. For every choice of parameters,
there exists an inﬁnite set of nontrivial solutions ˜hn to
Eq. (44) if χ is equal to the corresponding eigenvalue
χn, n = 1, 2, ... We order these values according to their
amplitude:
|χn| ≤ |χn+1|. The functional dependence
of the Eigenvalues χn on the model parameters is com-
pletely determined by dimensionless functions ¯χn(¯σ, ¯ω)
according to

χn =

κ
L2a2 ¯χn(¯σ, ¯ω)

,

(45)

where ¯σ ≡ σL2/κ and ¯ω ≡ ωξ⊥L4/κ are a dimensionless
tension and frequency, respectively.

The existence of discrete eigenvalues reveals that only
particular values of the linear response function of the
active material are consistent with being in the vicinity
of a Hopf-bifurcation. If the actual value of χ(Ω, ω) of
the system diﬀers from one of the eigenvalues χn, the
system is either not oscillating, or it oscillates with large
amplitude for which higher order terms in ǫ cannot be
neglected. An important consequence of this observa-
tion is that the modes ˜hn of ﬁlament beating close to a

8

Hopf-bifurcation can be calculated without knowledge of
the properties of the active elements. Not even knowl-
edge of the linear response coeﬃcient is required since it
follows as an eigenvalue at the bifurcation. Therefore,
ﬁlament motion close to a Hopf bifurcation has generic
or universal features which do not depend on details of
the problem such as the structural complexity within the
axoneme. The motion is given by one of the modes ˜hn
which only depend on ¯σ and ¯ω.

FIG. 7. (a) Eigenvalues ¯χn for boundary conditions B.
Each eigenvalue is represented by a line which traces the loca-
tions of ¯χn in the complex plane for varying reduced frequency
¯ω. The lines begin for ¯ω = 0 on the real axis, the value of ¯ω
at the other ends are indicated.

Fig. 4 displays the amplitude H and the gradient of
the phase ˙φ of the fundamental mode ˜h1 = He−iφ. Note,
that we use arbitrary units for H since the amplitude of
˜h(s) is not determined by Eq. (44). Corresponding ﬁl-
ament shapes represented according to Eq. (25) in the
(x, y) plane, are displayed in Fig. 5 for boundary con-
ditions A-C as snapshots taken at diﬀerent times. The
oscillation amplitudes are chosen in such a way that the
maximal value of ψ ≃ π/2. The direction of wave propa-
gation depends on the boundary conditions. For clamped
head (case A), waves propagate towards the head whereas
for ﬁxed or free head (cases B and C), they propagate
towards the tail. The positions of the lowest eigenvalues
¯χn in the complex plane for boundary conditions B are
displayed in Fig. 7 for ¯σ = 0 and varying ¯ω.

B. Selection of eigenmodes and frequency

In order to determine which of the modes ˜hn is selected
and at what frequency ω the system oscillates at the bi-
furcation point, explicit knowledge of the linear response
function χ(Ω, ω) is necessary. As a simple example, we
use χ as given by Eq. (41) for a two-state model. For
Ω = 0, χ = K + iλω which is a passive viscoelastic re-
sponse. In this case, no spontaneous motion is possible

which can be seen by the fact that all eigenvalues ¯χn
have negative real and imaginary parts which cannot be
matched by the linear response of a passive system. If Ω
is increased, we are interested in a critical point Ω = Ωc
for which the straight ﬁlament conﬁguration becomes un-
stable. This happens as soon as the linear response func-
tion χ matches for a particular frequency ω = ωc one of
the complex eigenvalues,

κ
a2L2 ¯χn(¯σ, ¯ωc) = χ(Ωc, ωc)

,

(46)

where ¯ωc = ξ⊥L4ωc/κ. Since χ is complex, both the real
and the imaginary part of Eq. (46) represent indepen-
dent conditions. Therefore, Eq.
(46) determines both
the critical point Ωc as well as the selected frequency ωc.
The selected mode n is the ﬁrst mode (beginning from
Ω = 0) to satisfy this condition. Since |χ(Ω, ω)| typi-
cally increases with increasing Ω, the instability occurs
almost exclusively for n = 1 since | ¯χ1| has been deﬁned
to have the smallest value. For Ω > Ωc, but close to the
transition, the system oscillates spontaneously with fre-
quency ωc. The shapes of ﬁlament beating are character-
ized by the corresponding mode ˜hn(s) whose amplitude
is determined by nonlinear terms. For the case of a con-
tinuous transition, the deformation amplitude increases
as |˜hn| ∼ (Ω − Ωc)1/2.

C. Axonemal vibrations for diﬀerent lengths

We choose the parameters of our model to correspond
to the axonemal structure. We estimate the bending
rigidity κ ≃ 4 · 10−22Nm2 which is the rigidity of about
20 microtubules. Furthermore, we choose a microtubule
separation a ≃ 20nm, motor density ρ ≃ 5 · 108m−1,
friction per unit length λ ≃ 1kg/ms, rate constant
α ≃ 103s−1, cross-bridge elasticity k ≃ 10−3N/m and
a perpendicular friction ξ⊥ ≃ 10−3kg/ms which is of
the order of the viscosity of water. A rough estimate
of the elastic modulus per unit length associated with
ﬁlament sliding can be obtained by comparing the num-
ber of dynein heads to the number of nexin links within
the axoneme. This suggests that K is relatively small,
K <

∼ kρ/10.
The selected frequency ωc at the bifurcation point for
case B is shown in Fig. 8 as a function of the axoneme
length for K = 0. For small lengths, the oscillation fre-
quency is large and increases as L decreases.
In this
high-frequency regime, which occurs for L <
∼ 10µm, the
system vibrates in a mode with no apparent wave prop-
agation. For L >
∼ 10µm the frequency is only weakly L-
dependent and the system propagates bending waves of
a wave-length shorter than the ﬁlament length.

The limit of small lengths corresponds to small ¯ω and
can be studied analytically. For ¯σ = 0, the eigenvalue
χ1 is given to linear order in ¯ω by ¯χ1 ≃ −π2/4 − iγ ¯ω.

For axoneme lengths below a characteristic value, L <

cillations exist only for L > Lmin. If (K + λα)/ρk ≪ 1,

Lmin ≃ pκ/4a2ρk ≃ 1µm for our choice of the param-

eters. The maximal frequency of oscillations occurs for
L = Lmin. Within the range of lengths between 1µm and
50µm, we ﬁnd frequencies ωc/2π which vary between tens
of Hz and about 20kHz. The parameters chosen in Fig.
8 lead to frequencies above 150Hz. Lower frequencies
are obtained for larger values of the friction λ or smaller
chemical rate α.

D. Eﬀect of external forces applied at the tail

In the presence of an external force applied at the end
¯σ 6= 0 and the ﬁlament pair is under tension. The eigen-

10

values ¯χn depend on ¯σ, therefore the tension aﬀects shape
and frequency of an unstable mode.
Inspection of Eq.
(44) suggests that the tension σ can be interpreted as an
additive contribution to the linear response coeﬃcient
χ → χ + σ/a2. Taking into account the boundary condi-
tions complicates the situation, the ¯σ-dependence of the
eigenvalues is in general nontrivial. However, for a ﬁla-
ment with clamped head and a force applied at the tail
parallel to the tangent at the head (case D) the eﬀect of
tension can be easily studied. In this particular case, the
tension leads to the same contribution to χ both in Eq.
(44) and in the boundary conditions and the eigenvalues
thus depend linearly on σ:

¯χn(¯σ, ¯ω) = ¯χn(0, ¯ω) − ¯σ .

(50)

Since the tension corresponds to a change of the real part
of χ, its presence has the same eﬀect on ﬁlament motion
as an increase of the elastic modulus K per unit length in
Eq. (41) by σ/a2. Therefore, we can include the eﬀects
of tension on the critical frequency in Eq. (48) by replac-
ing K → K + σ/a2 which reveals that in those regimes
where the frequency depends on K, it will increase for
increasing tension. The critical value of the control pa-
rameter Ωc is a function of the tension, with Eq. (49),
we ﬁnd

Ωc(σ) = Ωc(0) +

1
ρka2 σ .

(51)

For our choice of parameters, ρka2 ≃ 200pN which in-
dicates that forces of the order of 102pN should have a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the bifurcation. Furthermore, Eq.
(51) indicates that the tension σ can play the role of a
second control parameter for the bifurcation. Consider
a tensionless ﬁlament oscillating close to the bifurcation
for Ω > Ωc(0). If a tension is applied, the critical value
Ωc(σ) increases until the system reaches for a critical
tension σc a bifurcation point with Ωc(σc) = Ω and the
system stops oscillating.

V. DISCUSSION

In the previous sections, we have shown that many
aspects of axonemal eating can be described by a simple
model based on the idea of local sliding of microtubule
doublets driven by molecular motors inside the axoneme.
This model represents a class of physical systems termed
internally driven ﬁlaments (Camalet et al. 1999) which
have characteristic properties that are closely linked to
the geometric constraint that couples global bending and
local ﬁlament sliding.

Our work shows that axonemal beating can be studied
both numerically and analytically using a coarse-grained
description which ignores many details of the proteins in-
volved and is based on eﬀective material properties such

(cid:13)
as bending rigidities, internal friction coeﬃcient and elas-
tic modulus per unit length as well as the frequency de-
pendent linear response function of the active elements.
Our main results are: (i) The ﬁlament pair introduces a
geometric coupling of the active elements at diﬀerent po-
sition along the ﬁlaments. This coupling is suited for the
generation of periodic beating motion by a general self-
organization mechanism of the system. (ii) The genera-
tion of oscillations and propagating bending waves occurs
via a Hopf bifurcation for a critical value of a control-
parameter such as the ATP concentration. The patterns
of motion generated close to this bifurcation can be cal-
culated without any knowledge of the internal force gen-
erating mechanism if the oscillation frequency is known.
(iii) The frequency depends on chemical rates of the mo-
tors, coeﬃcients of internal elasticities and frictions, the
solvent viscosity and the microtubule rigidity. Our cal-
culations using a simple two-state model for molecular
motors suggest signiﬁcant variations of the oscillation fre-
quency if the axonemal length is varied. Short axonemes
are predicted to be able to oscillate at frequencies of sev-
eral kHz. This fact is particularly interesting in the case
of kinocilia which are located in the hair bundles of many
mechanosensitive cells that are involved in the detection
of sounds. If cilia are able to vibrate at high frequencies,
this suggests that the kinocilium could play as active role
in sound detection (Camalet et al. 2000). (iv) Forces ap-
plied to the axoneme can be an important tool to study
the mechanism of force generation. An external force
can play the role of a second control parameter for the
bifurcation which has a stabilizing eﬀect for increasing
forces.

These results have been obtained using several simpli-
fying assumptions. Our model represents the solvent hy-
drodynamics by an anisotropic local friction acting on the
rod-like ﬁlament. This approach ignores hydrodynamic
interactions between diﬀerent parts of the ﬁlament which
lead to logarithmic corrections. These hydrodynamic ef-
fects do not change the basic physics but can lead to cor-
rections to the numerical results. It is straightforward to
generalize our model to incorporate the eﬀects of hydro-
dynamic interaction, but this does not change our results
qualitatively. A more serious simpliﬁcation of our model
is the restriction to a two-dimensional system and to ﬁla-
ment conﬁgurations which are planar. This choice is mo-
tivated by the fact that observed bending waves of ﬂagella
are planar in many cases (Brokaw 1991). If ﬁlament con-
ﬁgurations are planar then our model applies and is com-
plete. However, this model cannot explain why motion
is conﬁned to a plane and it misses all non-planar modes
of beating. In order to address such questions, a three
dimensional generalizations have to be used. Such gen-
eralizations introduce additional aspects. In particular,
torsional deformations become relevant. The local sliding
displacements depend in the three dimensional case both
on bending and torsional deformations and the full tor-

11

sional dynamics has to be accounted for in the dynamic
equations. Finally, we have restricted most calculations
to the limit of small deformations which corresponds to
ﬁlament shapes that are almost straight. This regime has
several important features. The ﬁlament dynamics can
be studied by an analytic approach by a systematic ex-
pansion in the deformation amplitude. This allows us to
characterize linear and nonlinear terms both for the ﬁla-
ment dynamics as well as for the properties of the active
elements. Patterns of motion close to a Hopf bifurcation
are fully characterized by the linear terms of this expan-
sion. These linear terms are given by the structure of the
problem and their form does not depend on molecular
details of the system. For example, most details of the
operation of the molecular motors are unimportant for
the shape of the ﬁlament oscillations at the bifurcation,
only the linear response function of the active material
plays a role.

If ﬁlament beating with larger amplitude is of interest,
nonlinearities become relevant. Nonlinearities arise due
to nonlinear geometric terms in the bending energy or via
non-Hookian corrections of the elasticity. Furthermore,
nonlinearities in the force-generation process of molecular
motors exist. All these nonlinearities determine the large
amplitude motion and could give rise to new types of be-
havior such as additional dynamic instabilities. However,
in contrast to the linear terms, the form of the dominant
nonlinearities does depend on structural details of the ax-
oneme. Therefore, an analysis of large amplitude motion
is diﬃcult and knowledge of the nature of the dominating
nonlinearities is required. However, if no new instabili-
ties after the initial Hopf-bifurcation occur, the princi-
pal eﬀect of nonlinear terms is to ﬁx the amplitude of
propagating waves. We therefore expect that propagat-
ing waves with larger amplitude are in many cases well
approximated by our calculation to linear order.

Our work shows that propagating bending waves and
oscillatory motion of internally driven ﬁlaments can oc-
cur naturally by a simple physical mechanism. Complex
biochemical networks to control the system are not re-
quired for wave propagation to occur. This suggests that
the basic axonemal structure intrinsically has the ability
to oscillate. Biochemical regulation systems are thus ex-
pected to control this activity on a higher level but are
not responsible for oscillations. Our work shows that ex-
perimental studies of axonemal beating close to a Hopf
bifurcation would be very valuable. Such experiments
could be e.g. performed by using demembranated ﬂag-
ella and ATP concentrations not far from the level where
beating sets in. The observed behavior close to the bifur-
cation would give insight in the self-organization at work.
Furthermore, externally applied forces and manipulation
of boundary conditions could be sensitive tools to test
some of the predictions of our work.

The dynamics of h(s) and u(s) to second order in ǫ is
therefore determined by ψ1(s, t) and the motion ∂tr for
s = 0. For the latter, we ﬁnd from Eq. (15) ¯v1 = 0,
∂tu1(0) = 0, ∂th2(0) = 0 and

ξ⊥∂th1(0) = −κ

.

(B7)

For the lateral motion, we obtain with Eq.
(B4),

(B2) and

ξ⊥(∂th1(s) − ∂th1(0)) =h−κ

Using Eq. (B6), we obtain

which is the result given in Eq. (26). In order to calculate
τ2(s) and ¯v2 we integrate Eq. (B1). Together with Eq.

The tension at the head τ2(0), as well as ¯v2 + ∂tu2(0) are
ﬁxed using the boundary conditions. In cases A,B and
D where the head is ﬁxed ¯v2 + ∂tu2(0) = 0. In this case,
τ2(0) follows from Eq. (B11) at s = L. For boundary
condition C, the velocity of the head is determined from

12

the condition τ2(L) = 0 together with the boundary con-
ditions τ2(0) = −ψ1(0)(κ ¨ψ1(0)−af1(0))+ζ(¯v2 +∂tu2(0))

APPENDIX C: LINEAR AND NONLINEAR

RESPONSE FUNCTIONS OF THE TWO-STATE

MODEL

We introduce the Fourier modes of the distribution

function P1(ξ, t) =Pk P1(ξ, k)eikωt. The dynamic equa-

tion (35) of the two-state model can then be expressed
as

P1(ξ, k) = δk,0R(ξ) − iωXlm

Inserting the Ansatz

lδk,l+m
α + iωk

∆l∂ξP1(ξ, m) (C1)

P1(ξ, k) = Rδk,0 + P (1)

kl ∆l + P (2)

into Eq. (C1), one obtains a recursion relation

P (n)(ξ)k,k1,..,kn = −iωXl

(C3)

the knowledge of the functions P (n)
k,k1,..,kn allows one to
calculate the coeﬃcients of the expansion (38). In par-
ticular, with P (0) = R, one obtains the result (39) and

APPENDIX D: EIGENVALUES AND

EIGENMODES NEAR A HOPF BIFURCATION

Nontrivial solutions to Eq. (44) can be found using the

Ansatz ˜h = Aeqs/L with q being solution to

q4 − (¯σ + ¯χ)q2 + i¯ω = 0

(D1)

Here, ¯σ ≡ σL2/κ, ¯ω ≡ ωξ⊥L4/κ, and ¯χ ≡ χa2L2/κ are
a dimensionless tension, frequency and linear response
coeﬃcient, respectively. Eq. (D1) has four complex so-
lutions qi, i = 1, .., 4. Therefore,

13

˜h =

Xi=1

Aieqis/L .

(D2)

In order to determine the amplitudes Ai the four bound-
ary conditions have to be used. Since Eq. (44) is linear
and homogeneous, the equations for the coeﬃcients Ai
have the form

AiMij = 0

,

(D3)

Xi=1

where Mij is a 4×4 matrix which depends on ¯χ, ¯σ and ¯ω.
Nontrivial solutions exist only for those values ¯χ = ¯χn
for which det Mij = 0. The corresponding eigenmode
is the solution for Ai of Eq.
(D3). These eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions can be determined by numerically ob-
taining solutions for det Mij = 0. In the limit of small
¯ω, analytic expressions can be obtained by inserting the
ansatz ¯χ = ¯χ(0) + ¯χ(1) ¯ω + O(¯ω2) for the eigenvalue which
leads to an expansion of det Mij in powers of ¯ω1/2. This
procedure leads for ¯σ = 0 to ¯χ(0)
n = −[(n − 1)π + π/2]2
independent of boundary conditions. The linear coeﬃ-
cient ¯χ(1)
1 = −iγ depends on boundary conditions. For
boundary conditions A

γ =

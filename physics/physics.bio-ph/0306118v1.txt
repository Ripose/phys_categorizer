A computer model was developed for estimation of the kinetics of microbial inactivation by pulsed
electric ﬁeld. The model is based on the electroporation theory of individual membrane damage,
where spherical cell geometry and distribution of cell sizes are assumed. The variation of microbial
cell sizes was assumed to follow a statistical probability distribution of the Gaussian type. Surviving
kinetics was approximated by Weibull equation. The dependencies of two Weibull parameters (shape
n and time τ , respectively) versus electric ﬁeld intensity E and width of cell diameters distribution
was studied.

INTRODUCTION

Pulsed electric ﬁelds (PEF) processing is a promising
method of food preservation. Many investigators have
shown the eﬀectiveness of PEF application for killing
bacteria in liquid foods (Barbosa-Canovas et al., 1998;
Barsotti & Cheftel, 1998; Wouters & Smelt, 1997). How-
ever, there still exist a considerable gap in understanding
the inactivation mechanism. The important problem is
to elucidate how kinetics of killing depends on the type of
bacteria and treatment protocol (electric ﬁeld strength E,
form of pulse, pulse duration ti, total time of treatment).
The phenomenon of PEF-inactivation of microbial
cells is related to selective damage of biological mem-
brane. Electrical conductivity of the membrane σ is
very low. The reported values are of order of σ
≈
10−6
10−7Ω−1m−1(Kotnik et al., 1998). Therefore, the
highest drop of potential occurs on the membranes. The
transmembrane potential of a spherical cell um depends
on the angle θ between the external ﬁeld E direction and

the radius-vector r on the membrane surface, where po-
tential is to be determined (Fig. 1). This potential may
be determined using the well-known Schwan’s equation
(Schwan, 1957),

um = 0.75f dcEcosθ,

(1)

where dc is the cell diameter, and f is a parameter de-
pending on electrophysical and dimensional properties of
the membrane, cell and surrounding media.
In dilute
suspension of cells, parameter f is close to 1 (Kotnik et
al., 1998).

±

So, the cell transmembrane potentials um in suspen-
sion of cells depend on the cell diameter dc and angle
θ and for the single cell value of um is maximal at cell
π/2. That is why the
poles and decreases to zero at θ =
membrane damage probability is maximal at membrane
poles and that bigger sized microbial cells are killed be-
fore smaller ones. Microbial cells always show a variety
of shapes and dimensions (Bergey, 1986). Their size may
vary depending on their age, the nutrients in the growth
medium, release mechanisms of microbial particles etc.
(Harding, 1975; Reponen et al., 1992). So, microbial
cells killing probability can also change from cell to cell.
After PEF treatment during time t in the electric ﬁeld
E the surviving fraction S(t, E) is deﬁned as the ratio
of the number of undamaged microbial cells to the to-
tal number of microbial cells (Barbosa-Canovas et al.,
1998). If all the cells are spherical and are of the same
size, then their damage may be considered as statistically
independent events, and the time dependence S(t, E) can
be approximated by the ﬁrst-order kinetic equation:

S(t, E) = exp(

t/τ (E)),

(2)

−

where τ (E) is a time parameter that corresponds to the
eﬀective inactivation time of cells in the external electric
ﬁeld E.

Unfortunately,

in most cases, the simplest approxi-
mation of the ﬁrst-order kinetics is not applicable for
description of the microbial inactivation experiments in

where tc and Ec are the threshold treatment time and

Although this equation is very popular, it has no theo-
retical justiﬁcation.

The models widely used presently for describing the
survival curves are Fermi, log-log and log-logistic models
(Barbosa-Canovas et al., 1998; Peleg, 1996; Alvarez et al.,
2000) but they are also of an empirical nature. Speciﬁ-
cally, the Weibull distribution may be a useful general-
ization that that includes exponential ﬁrst order kinetics
as a special case (Peleg, 1995, 1999)

S(t, E) = exp(

(t/τ (E))n(E)),

(4)

−

where τ (E) is a time parameter and n(E) is a shape
parameter. In the case when n(E)=1, Eq. (4) reduces to
Eq. (2).

The time parameter τ (E) in Weibull distribution ac-
counts for the eﬀective inactivation time, and shape pa-
rameter n(E) accounts for the concavity of a survival
curve (van Boekel, 2002). Weibull distribution was ap-
plied for ﬁtting experimental PEF inactivation data (Al-
varez et al., 2002), but physical meaning of the obtained
parameters τ (E) and n(E) was not elucidated yet.

A possible deviation from the ﬁrst order PEF inacti-
vation kinetics may be caused by existence of a variety
of microbial shapes and dimensions. The purpose of this
paper is to analyse how the form of the survivor curves
can reﬂect existence of a distribution of cell diameters.

II. COMPUTATIONAL MODEL AND DETAILS
OF CALCULATIONS

The Monte Carlo technique was used for simulation of
PEF inactivation kinetics of microbial cells. Initial num-
ber of microbial cell in suspension was put as No=107. A
Gaussian law distribution function of cell diameters was
assumed (Fig.1)

F (dc) =

1
√2π∆

exp(

(dc −

),

(5)

where ¯dc and ∆ represent the average diameter and the
standard deviation, respectively.

An arbitrary microbial cell was chosen in suspension
for a given time t. Then, a random point on the mem-
brane surface was chosen by generating of cosθ value ran-
1-+1. The lifetime of a mem-
domly in the intervals
brane τ on the surface of a cell depends on its diameter
dc, angle θ, and intensity of external ﬁeld E. It was found
on the basis of the transient aqueous pore model (Weaver

The probability of

approximated by the ﬁrst-order kinetic equation as
exp(
t/τ (θ, dc, E)). This procedure was repeated for all
the cells in the suspension. Then, the number of killed
cells was enumerated for the given time t, surviving frac-
tion S(t, E) was calculated, time was increased by a time
step and procedure was repeated from beginning.

Weibull equation within time interval of 0 < t/τ∞ < 200.

given value of reduced ﬁeld intensity E∗ = 10 (E
22.7
kV/cm, at dc = 1µm). The ﬁrst order kinetics law is only
observed for suspensions of identical cells (∆/ ¯dc = 0). In
other cases, the noticeable deviations from the ﬁrst or-
der kinetics are observed and the more pronounced devi-
ations are observed with increase of ∆/ ¯dc.

The solid lines drawn through the symbols are the best
ﬁt to data simulated using the Weibull function (Eq. 4).
The Weibull law seems to be very appropriate for approx-
imation of calculated survival curves (in all the cases the
correlation coeﬃcient ρ was higher than 0.993). Insert
to Fig.2 shows the shape n and relative time τ /τ∞ pa-
rameters of Weibull distribution versus relative width of
cell diameter distribution ∆/ ¯dc. In these estimations the
ﬁtting was done within the time interval 1 < t/τ∞ < 200.
10−7s (Lebedeva, 1987) this time interval
At τ∞
corresponds to 0 < t < 74µs. Both the shape parame-
ter n and the relative time τ /τ∞ parameter initially de-
crease with increases of the standard deviation ∆. Then,
a small elevation of these values is observed, which can be
explained by the distortion of the Gaussian distribution
at higher values of ∆/ ¯dc. But this model always gives
only upward concavity, i.e. n < 1.

Parameters n and τ /τ∞ are also very sensitive to the
value of electric ﬁeld intensity E (Fig. 3). Dependencies
of n versus E∗ are rather complex, but in all cases param-
eter n increases with increase of the distribution width
∆/ ¯dc. Relative time parameter τ /τ∞ decreases consid-
erably with ﬁeld intensity E increase, but it is practi-
cally independent of ∆/ ¯dc. So, it is possible to conclude
that upward concavity of survivor curve is rather sensi-
tive both to the ﬁeld intensity and to the variability of
microbial diameter distribution, but the eﬀective inacti-

duced electric ﬁeld intensity of E∗ = E(0.75f dc/uo) = 6 and

data presented in Fig.1 and Fig. 2. The insert shows cal-
culated survivor curve S(t/τ∞) for this particular case. The

the Weibull equation in the time interval t/τ∞ < 105.

vation time τ (E) is insensitive to the variations in cell
diameters.

The numerically estimated shape n and relative time
τ /τ∞ parameters are rather sensitive to the time interval
of Monte Carlo data ﬁtting with Weibull function Eq.
(4). Fig. 4 shows a typical example of n and τ /τ∞ versus
tmax/τ∞ dependencies for ﬁtting of the same survival
curve when upper bound of the time interval 1 < t/τ∞ <
tmax/τ∞ is varied. In fact, tmax/τ∞ is a relative total
time of treatment. In all cases, the apparent consistency
between Monte Carlo data and Weibull function with
adjusted parameters n and τ /τ∞ was rather good, and
the correlation coeﬃcients ρ lied in the interval 0.993-
0.998. But at the same time, parameter n and τ /τ∞ are
sensitive to the upper cutting boundary tmax/τ∞, and
this fact reﬂects existence of an intrinsic inconsistency
between unknown survival function and Weibull function.

IV. CONCLUSION

The discussed illustrative examples show that geome-
try of the survival curve is very sensitive to the distri-
bution of cell diameters. The Weibull function seems to
be appropriate for approximation of the calculated sur-
vival curves. The parameters of this function τ and n
are rather sensitive to the width of distribution of the
cells diameters, electric ﬁeld intensity and total time of
treatment. We would note, that the proposed model is
based on several restrictive assumptions. The survival
kinetics may reﬂect many intrinsic details of the real mi-
crobial cells. For explanation of the survival curves, ex-

perimentally observed for PEF-inactivated population, it
is necessary to introduce into the model the experimen-
tally determined distribution functions of cell diameters.
It is also desirable to use in calculations more realistic
law of an individual membrane damage, based on exper-
imentally estimated data for the given bacterial popu-
lation. The possible eﬀects of sub-lethal damage, when
bacterial damage needs some critical destructive expo-
sure, also were not considered in this model. A deviation
from the ﬁrst-order kinetics may be also inﬂuenced by
others factors, such as existence of bacterial geometry
anisotropy and distribution of bacterial orientations. So,
in future it is seems to be important to ﬁnd correlations
between variations in factors, inﬂuencing bacterial ge-
ometry, dimension distribution function, details of mem-
brane damage and parameters of bacterial inactivation
kinetics. Such work should be done in order to improve
practically important PEF-treatment regimes for reach-
ing a desirable value of microbial inactivation.

We report on a new technique which was used to detect single Escherichia coli that is based on the
changes in the nonlinear rotation of a magnetic microsphere driven by an external magnetic ﬁeld.
The presence of one Escherichia Coli bacterium on the surface of a 2.0 µm magnetic microsphere
caused an easily measurable change in the drag of the system and, therefore, in the nonlinear
rotation rate. The straight-forward measurement uses standard microscopy techniques and the
observed average shift in the nonlinear rotation rate changed by a factor of ∼3.8.

Magnetic microspheres and nanoparticles have been
used for a variety of medical applications and incorpo-
rated into various diagnostic techniques [1, 2, 3]. While
magnetic particles have proven to be extremely useful,
they have been generally utilized in techniques that de-
pend on the translational properties of magnetic parti-
cles, such as magnetic separation, giant magneto-resistive
(GMR) sensors [4], and magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)
sensors [5]; however, it is possible through standard mi-
croscopy techniques, to monitor the rotational behav-
ior of single magnetic particles or small chains of them
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. These small magnetic systems have been
utilized to improve immunoassays [11], to act as micro-
mixers [7], study microrheology [8, 12] and even to reduce
interfering background in ﬂuorescent spectroscopy mea-
surements [6]. While single bacteria have been detected
in ﬂuid using nanoparticles [13], a dynamic application
that has yet to be developed is the detection of single
micro-biological agents using magnetic particles. We re-
port on the ﬁrst measurement of a single bacterium using
a rotating micro-stage.

This new method, being development by the authors,
is based on the nonlinear rotation that a magnetic mi-
crosphere undergoes when driven by a rotating magnetic
ﬁeld [10, 14]. The eﬀect occurs when the viscous torque
that arises from rotational drag is comparable to the
magnetic torque created by the external driving ﬁeld. At
low external driving frequencies, the magnetic particle ro-
tates continuously and is synchronous with the external
ﬁeld, but at suﬃciently high external driving frequen-
cies, the particle becomes asynchronous with the driving
ﬁeld. The external driving frequency, where the mag-
netic particle goes from linear to nonlinear (synchronous
to asynchronous) rotation, is dependent on environmen-
tal conditions in addition to the particle properties and

where

Equation 2 holds for low Reynolds number environments
(Re ≪ 1) and for our system Re ≈ 5 × 10−6.

Nonlinear rotation occurs when Ω > Ωc [15] and we
propose that this rate can be used to detect single mi-
crobiological agents. The parameters that are important
in biological detection are shape and volume because of
the drag changes that occur when a bacteria binds to a

microsphere. So, when a bacteria attaches to a nonlinear
rotating magnetic microsphere, the micro-stage’s volume
and shape are drastically changed, which produces more
drag and, therefore, the rotation rate slows considerably.
This is shown schematically in Figure 1. The technique
is dynamic in the sense that a change in drag causes a
direct change in the nonlinear rotation rate. Past mea-
surements have shown that this technique can measure
a change of drag caused by an attachment of a 1.0 µm
particle to a 1.9 µm nonlinear rotating magnetic micro-
sphere [16].

The ability to develop sensitive diagnostic techniques
using dynamic systems has been a topic of high interest.
One related technology that has demonstrated extreme
sensitivity in air and vacuum environments is nanoelec-
tromechanical systems (NEMS) [17]. NEMS have been
used to measure the mass of single micro-biological agents
like antibodies, viruses, and bacteria [18, 19, 20]. One of
the NEMS detection schemes utilize the fact that the res-
onant oscillations change when a micro-biological agent
attaches, but the sensitivity of such devices are drasti-
cally aﬀected when operated in ﬂuidic environments [21].
The idea underlying nonlinear rotating magnetic parti-
cles can be used in a similar way, namely when a biologi-
cal agent attaches to the magnetic particle, the nonlinear
rotation frequency changes, but in such systems sensitiv-
ity is unaﬀected, rather helped by drag. This allows for
single biological agent detection in ﬂuidic environments.
Thus, in this letter we show that the nonlinear rotation
frequency of single magnetic microspheres on average ro-
tates signiﬁcantly slower when a single bacterium is at-
tached to their surface.

A 20 µL aliquot of 2.0 µm ferromagnetic microspheres
functionalized with goat antimouse IgG (Spherotech IL)
was spread onto a precut microscope slide and coated
with ∼50 nm of Al. The sample was placed in a uni-
form magnetic ﬁeld of 1.4 kOe so that the magnetiza-
tion would be perpendicular to the microscope glass. The
spheres were then rinsed with phosphate buﬀer solution
(PBS) at a pH of 7.2 and suspended in 500 µL of PBS.
The suspended sample was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for
8 minutes and resuspended in 500 µL of PBS at a pH
of 7.2. The sample was centrifuged once more at 9000
rpm for 8 minutes and the supernatant was removed.
100 µL of mouse anti-E. Coli IgG (Cortex Biochem, San
Diego, CA) was added to the pellet of magnetic micro-
spheres. The primary antibody and the magnetic micro-
spheres were allowed to incubate at room temperature for
4 hours. The excess primary antibody was removed by
centrifuging the sample at 9000 rpm for 8 minutes and
the supernatant was discarded. Finally, the magnetic mi-
crospheres were resuspended into 500 µL of PBS. At each
of the above stages the sample was vortexed at 3000 rpm
for 15 seconds.

To make the bacteria ﬂuorescent, a DsRed plasmid was
used with Escherichia Coli BL21(DE3) following previ-
ously described transformation procedures [22]. The bac-
teria were allowed to reproduce until the sample had an

2

optical density of .67 at 600 nm and was stored at 4 oC.
The magnetic microspheres with the anti-E. Coli anti-
body were mixed 1:1 with the now ﬂuorescent E. Coli
described. To make binding more probable, the sample
was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 8 minutes. The sam-
ple was then vortexed at 3000 rpm for 15 seconds and
allowed to incubate. The resulting sample had many sin-
gle microspheres with 1-5 E. Coli bound to their surface,
where visual analysis was used to conﬁrm the presence
of a single bacterium.

Two homemade ∼100 µm thick ﬂuidic cells were fab-
ricated: one ﬂuidic cell contained the magnetic micro-
sphere solution before bacteria was added and the other
had magnetic microspheres with bacteria bound to their
surfaces. Before being placed in the ﬂuidic cells, the sam-
ples were mixed with glycerol so that the glycerol-water
mass fraction was 0.5. The nonlinear rotation rates for
20 single magnetic microspheres, without bacteria, were
obtained by monitoring the intensity ﬂuctuations caused
by light reﬂecting oﬀ of the aluminum half-shell. From
the other ﬂuidic cell, 20 nonlinear rotation rates were ob-
tained for single magnetic microspheres with one E. Coli
bound to their surfaces by monitoring the intensity ﬂuc-
tuations caused by the bacteria ﬂuorescence (for more ex-
perimental and data analysis details see Refs [6, 10, 14]).
The rotation rates were then averaged and compared to
determine the rotation rate changes caused by the bac-
teria.

The theory for a single magnetic particle rotating in
response to an external driving ﬁeld is well developed
[10, 14, 23], but measurements have not previously been
made for the case of a magnetic particle attached to a
bacteria. Figure 2(a) shows the average rotation rate of
such a system for increasing external driving frequencies.
The data is in good agreement with the ﬁt determined
from Equation 2 and the critical slipping rate, Ωc, was
found to be 1.27 Hz. This measurement shows that when
a bacteria is bound to the surface of a magnetic micro-
sphere, the system can still be analyzed using previously
developed theory. Thus, a change in rotation rate can be
used to detect bacteria.

While the entire range of frequencies for magnetic par-
ticles with and without bacteria could be scanned as was
done in Figure 2(a), it is much faster and more straight-
forward to only measure the value of the nonlinear ro-
tation rate,
, at a given external driving frequency
of Ω. Figure 2(b) shows this measurement for a typical
magnetic microsphere with and without a single bacteria
attached to its surface. Figure 2(c) shows the curves for
the rotation rate of 20 particles in a ﬂuidic cell with bac-
teria and for 20 particles in one without bacteria. The
presence of the bacteria on the surface of the magnetic
microspheres caused a measurable change in the average
rotation rate, namely the average rate of the particles at

in rotation rate is similar in value to our previous mea-
surements on a 1.0 µm particle that was attached to a
single ∼1.9 µm ferromagnetic microsphere [16]. Once
a bacteria is attached to a magnetic microsphere, this
technique could also be used to monitor single bacteria
growth, which could have signiﬁcant application for the
study of single bacteria growth dynamics and in antibi-
otic susceptibility measurements.

The ability to use the change in nonlinear rotation of
magnetic particles to detect bacteria has been demon-
strated. The nonlinear rotation rate of 2.0 µm magnetic

microspheres changed on average from 0.72 Hz without
a bacterium to 0.19 Hz with a single bacterium attached,
where the driving oscillatory magnetic ﬁeld was at a fre-
quency of 4.0 Hz.

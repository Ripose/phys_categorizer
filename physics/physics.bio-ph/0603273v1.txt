Abstract

Cells or bacteria carrying cilia on their surface show many striking features :
alignment of cilia in an array, two-phase asymmetric beating for each cilium,
coordination between cilia and existence of metachronal waves with a con-
stant phase diﬀerence between two adjacent cilia. We give simple theoretical
arguments based on hydrodynamic coupling and an internal mechanism of
the cilium derived from the behavior of a collection of molecular motors, to
account qualitatively for these cooperative features. Hydrodynamic interac-
tions can lead to the alignment of an array of cilia. We study the eﬀect of a
transverse external ﬂow and obtain a two-phase asymmetrical beating, faster
along the ﬂow and slower against the ﬂow, proceeding around an average
curved position. We show that an aligned array of cilia is able to sponta-
neously break the left-right symmetry and to create a global average ﬂow.
Metachronism arises as a local minimum of the beating threshold and leads
to a rather constant ﬂow.

1 Introduction

Many cells and bacteria have cilia or ﬂagella on their surfaces. Examples
are sperm cells which have one ﬂagellum used for propulsion, the green
alga Chlamydomonas that uses two ﬂagella, and the much studied proto-
zoan Paramecium which is covered by a layer of cilia. This layer is made
out of approximately four thousands cilia which produce a very eﬃcient mo-
tion with a velocity of order 1mm/s in water, corresponding to 10 times
the Paramecium size/s. Humans have ciliated cells in several organs: in the
brain (cerebrospinal ﬂuid ﬂow), the retina (photoreceptor connective cilia),
the respiratory tract (epithelial cells), the ear (hair bundles), the Falopian
tube or the kidney...

Cilia have two major roles: (i) detection (sensory cilia or ﬂagella), for
example in the retina, the ear and the kidney (ii) propulsion or creation of
ﬂuid ﬂow (motile cilia or ﬂagella) as for Paramecium or in the respiratory
tract where the ﬂuid ﬂow is used to move away the mucus.

The common structure of most cilia and ﬂagella is an axoneme wrapped
by the plasma membrane. The (9+2) axoneme is made of 9 microtubule
doublets arranged on a circle around a central pair of microtubules (1). The
cilium or ﬂagellum is attached to the cell membrane by a basal body made of 9
microtubule triplets which has a structure very similar to that of a centriole.
The basal body is attached to the cell membrane by anchoring ﬁbers (2).
Typically the radius of an axoneme is 100 nm. The main structural diﬀerence
between cilia and ﬂagella is their length. The typical length of a cilium is
10µm whereas a ﬂagellum can be ten times longer.

Dynein molecular motors are attached to the 9 microtubule doublets; they
move towards the microtubules
ends linked to the basal body and exert
forces on the microtubules. Upon consumption of Adenosine-Tri-Phosphate
(ATP), dynein motion generates forces that induce a sliding between adjacent
microtubules. Because the whole structure is attached at its basis, this sliding
motion induces the bending of the cilium or ﬂagellum and its beating.

We here focus on ciliated cells creating ﬂuid ﬂow. These are cells with
cilia on their surface, beating in one preferred direction in a coordinated
way. One central feature of cilia beating is the existence of two phases with a
broken symmetry. Each beating can be decomposed into an eﬀective stroke
(ES) that propels the ﬂuid and a recovery stroke (RS) where the cilium is
coming back against the ﬂow. In the example of Paramecium in water, the
eﬀective stroke lasts typically 9ms whereas the recovery stroke lasts 26ms.

The typical beating frequency in water is 30Hz (3). The beating of Parame-
cium cilia is 3-dimensional but for some species like Opalina the cilia remain
in the same plane during their beating and the beating is 2-dimensional. In
this work, we discuss the role of an external velocity ﬁeld in this left-right
symmetry breaking between the eﬀective stroke and the recovery stroke for
planar beating.

One of the most striking features of an assembly of beating cilia is that
they all beat in the same direction: the surrounding ﬂuid can only be pro-
pelled eﬃciently if all the beatings have the same orientation. In all mature
ciliated cells, the beating direction is deﬁned by the anchoring of the basal
foot on the basal body. Only newly formed or developing cilia are randomly
oriented (4). When they start beating, they tend to spontaneously align to
ﬁnally beat in the same direction. One of the questions addressed in this
article is the nature of the parameters that control this orientation.

The role of the central pair of microtubules in the center of the axoneme is
also a fundamental and complex question. In many species (such as Chlamy-
domonas), the central pair is both rotating and twisting within the axoneme
during the axoneme movement. Current models postulate that the central
pair modulates dynein activity along outer microtubule doublets (5). It thus
allows the axoneme motion because if all the dyneins were acting at the same
time, no bending would occur. Evidence in support of this model includes
the observation that sliding between adjacent doublets occurs preferentially
along doublets closest to one of the two microtubules of the central pair (the
C1) in Chlamydomonas ﬂagella (6). Nevertheless, there exist also motile cilia
with a (9+0) axoneme having no central pair. This means that cilia beating
is possible even in the absence of the central pair of microtubules. Despite
its importance, we do not discuss the role of the central pair in the present
work and we postpone its discussion to future work.

Another important feature of ciliated cells, is the existence of waves prop-
agating all along the surface. These are called metachronal waves and might
be due to the coordination of adjacent cilia for example via hydrodynamic
interactions. Experimentally metachronal waves are observed to propagate
in all possible directions:
in the direction of the eﬀective stroke (symplec-
tic metachronal waves), in the opposite direction (antiplectic), or even in a
perpendicular (laeoplectic or dexioplectic) or oblique direction. The origin
of these waves and the mechanisms controlling their formation are not well
understood. We show in this article that metachronism can arise naturally
from the hydrodynamic couplings between cilia. Using a two-state model

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

4

for the dynein motion as an internal mechanism of the cilia, metachronism
appears to be a local minimum in the oscillation threshold of the motors
(7, 8).

A last important feature of cilia beating that we wish to mention, is
the role of calcium ions. The local [Ca2+] concentration has a strong inﬂu-
ence on the beating pattern of cilia or ﬂagella. For example detergent-treated
Paramecium are able to swim forward at low [Ca2+] concentration (< 10−6M)
and backward at high [Ca2+] concentration (> 10−6M) because of ciliary re-
versal: the directions of eﬀective and recovery strokes are switched (9, 10). In
any case, the wild type Paramecium can have a very eﬃcient backward mo-
tion monitored by calcium tanks in its body. We only discuss here qualitative
aspects of the role of calcium.

In this paper, we address the question of the spontaneous alignment of an
array of beating cilia and the possibility of a spontaneous symmetry break-
ing in the beating that leads to the appearance of a macroscopic ﬂuid ﬂow.
The internal mechanism of the cilia is described by the model of references
(7, 8) which is based on a two-state model to describe the cooperative ef-
fects between dynein motors and only considers the relative sliding of two
microtubules in the axoneme. The coordination between the cilia is due to
hydrodynamic interactions which are discussed in details in a coarse-grained
description where the eﬀect of the cilia on the ﬂow is replaced by an eﬀective
force. The outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we give
a simple model for the alignment of beating cilia. In section 3, we discuss
the beating of one cilium following the model of J¨ulicher and Camalet (7, 8).
Finally, in section 4 we discuss the spontaneous breaking of the left-right
symmetry of the beating due to the ﬂow created by the cilia themselves.

2 Spontaneous alignment of an array of cilia:

a simple model

2.1 Experimental results

In an assembly of cilia covering the surface of a mature cell, cilia are beating in
a preferred direction, and only newly formed or developing cilia are randomly
oriented (4). We ﬁrst discuss the experiments showing how this preferred
orientation is chosen.

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

As mentioned before, the ciliary axoneme grows from a basal body anal-
ogous to a centriole. Two basal body appendages, the basal foot and the
striated rootlet, located in the axial plane of the eﬀective stroke, confer an
asymmetrical organization to the basal body. The basal foot is laterally asso-
ciated with two consecutive triplets and points in the direction of the eﬀective
stroke (11, 12). The striated rootlet, associated with the proximal end of the
basal body, sinks into the cytoplasm in the opposite direction (11). These
two appendages deﬁne therefore an orientation of a cilium independent of
the beating motion.

During ciliogenesis, newly formed basal bodies migrate toward the cell
membrane where they anchor with no apparent order. Anchoring induces
axoneme assembly, and cilia grow in random orientations. While cilia are
growing, they do not beat immediately. A reorientation by rotation of the
basal bodies in a common direction occurs at the ﬁnal stage of ciliogenesis,
when mature cilia beat (13). The preferred direction of the assembly is then
well-deﬁned. In the immotile-cilia syndrome, axonemes are incomplete, and
the ciliary activity is abnormal or absent: the ﬂuid is poorly or not propelled.
On the cell level, the basal bodies are randomly oriented (14).

These experimental facts suggest that the beating and orientation of cilia
are closely related. Our working hypothesis is that the alignment of an
assembly of beating cilia is mostly due to hydrodynamical coupling between
cilia. The global ﬂow created by the other cilia tend to orient a given cilium
and above a certain beating amplitude, all cilia orient in the same direction.
We now give a very simple modelling of this cooperative alignment.

2.2 Alignment transition

It is the case for
We assume in the following that the beating is planar.
Opalina for example, but not exactly for Paramecium where the recovery
stroke is not in the plane of the eﬀective stroke.

Near the top of the ciliary layer, observations show that the velocity is
time independent and uniform (15). Consequently, we average the beating
over one time period and replace each cilium of length L (and its eﬀective
and recovery stroke) by a single force (stokeslet) ~f , parallel to the surface,
created in the ﬂuid of viscosity η at height h < L above the membrane, as
sketched in ﬁgure 1.

We choose the x axis in the direction of the eﬀective stroke and the z
axis perpendicular to the cell surface that we approximate by a plane. The

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

stokeslet along the x axis ( ~f = f ~ex), is located at point ~S = (0, 0, h).

The velocity created at point ~X = (x, y, z) by this stokeslet with a no-slip

boundary condition on the plane z = 0 is given by :

~v( ~X) = G( ~X, ~S). ~f

In order to simplify the hydrodynamic problem, we assume in all the
following that the cilia are far away from each other.
In this asymptotic
limit, it is consistent to describe the eﬀect of the cilium in the ﬂuid by a
stokeslet. We introduce the two-dimensional vector along the cell surface
~r = (x, y) and consider the limit r
z, h, L. We are interested in the
velocity in the vicinity of the ciliary layer, typically 0 < z < 1.5 L. At
lowest order in z/r, the velocity reads:

where we have deﬁned a dimensionless height ¯z = z/L. In the following, we
use mostly the velocity ~u(r, θ). At this order, the ﬂow ﬁeld is a radial ﬂow
centered on the cilium-stokeslet. Note that because of the no slip boundary
condition on the surface, the force appears in the velocity ﬁeld (Eq. 2) in the
combination f h homogeneous to a momentum.

We consider now a regular array of cilia; this is a reasonable assumption
for Paramecium, which shows a beautiful and very regular array of cilia on
its surface (17). We assume that this array is in an inﬁnite plane. Cilium
i is deﬁned by its position in the x, y plane (the cell surface) by a vector ~ri
and by the angle of its plane of beating with the x axis, φi as displayed on
Fig. 2.

The total velocity at the cilium i at height z, ~V (~ri, z) is the sum of all

The mean ﬁeld approximation assumes that the ﬂuctuations around a
given angle determining the direction of the ﬂow are small. We choose the
x axis in the direction of the ﬂow without any loss of generality, so that the
probability P (φ) is peaked around φ = 0.

In order to determine the probability P (φ), we write a stationary Fokker-
Planck equation ∂φJ = 0. The probability current J = P ∂tφ
Dr∂φP is
the sum of two terms: a convection term and a diﬀusion term where Dr
is a rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The beating plane can ﬂuctuate due to
thermal ﬂuctuations. Because of the ﬂow, if the beating plane of one cilium
is at an angle φ with the ﬂow direction, the cilium is subject to a torque

Within the mean ﬁeld approximation Eq. 9 deﬁnes a dynamical phase tran-
sition between a non-moving ﬂuid with randomly oriented cilia and a moving
ﬂuid with a global ﬂow V (z) = U ¯z
= 0 given by Eq. 8 where all cilia are
spontaneously aligned in the same orientation. This dynamical phase tran-
sition is second order (with a continuous velocity at the transition) and it is
associated to a spontaneous breaking of the initial O(2) symmetry.

The inﬂuence of some of the parameters can be directly analyzed on
Eq. 9. A decrease of the distance d between two cilia favors the alignment,
increasing the hydrodynamic coupling. A decrease of the temperature T also
favors alignment as the random thermal motion opposes the alignment. An
increase of the eﬀective hydrodynamic force of one cilium f is associated to
an increase the hydrodynamic interactions between cilia and leads to a better
alignment. The same eﬀect occurs for α and the cilium length L. Finally,
increasing h helps to create a global ﬂow, since the velocity on the membrane
vanishes and the higher the force is exerted, the more eﬃcient.

A more precise analysis requires the estimation of the parameters f, α
L. The calculation of

α is given in appendix I for a general beating (Eq. 54). It turns out that α is
linked to the diﬀerence of the areas covered during the eﬀective and recovery

strokes. Here we approximate α

the amplitude of the
movement of the tip.

beating favors the alignment of cilia, as could be expected. Increasing the
viscosity of the medium also promotes the transition, because it increases
the coupling between cilia.

A

This naive mean ﬁeld approximation is only a ﬁrst step of our study. In
the following, we take a closer look at the internal beating mechanism of one
cilium and then at the beating of an array of cilia to obtain a more precise
and quantitative description.

3 Axonemal beating

In this section we discuss the beating mechanism of a single cilium. We follow
closely the work of Camalet and J¨ulicher (8) which mimics the cilium by
two microtubule ﬁlaments sliding along one another under the action of the
dynein motors and uses a 2-state model to describe the collective motion of
the dyneins. We use as boundary conditions for the motion those introduced
recently by Hilﬁnger and J¨ulicher (20) that seem to have good experimental
support (21).
In the next section, we use the same model to discuss the
coordination between cilia.

3.1 Equation of motion

Each microtubule doublet within the axoneme can be described eﬀectively as
an elastic rod. Deformations of this rod lead to local sliding displacements
of neighboring microtubules. Here, we only consider planar deformations.
In this case the geometrical coupling between bending and sliding can be
captured by considering two parallel elastic ﬁlaments (corresponding to two
microtubule doublets) with a constant separation a along the whole length
of the rod (see Fig. 3). At one end, which corresponds to the basal end of
an axoneme, the two ﬁlaments are elastically attached and are allowed to
slide with respect to each other, but not to tilt (20). The basal connection is
characterized by an elasticity k and a frictional drag γ. The conﬁgurations
of the axoneme are described by the shape of the ﬁlament pair given by the
position of one ﬁlament ~X(s) at arclength s. The shape of the other ﬁlament
is then given by ~X ′(s) = ~X(s)
a~n(s), where ~n is the ﬁlament normal. In the
following, we describe the ﬁlament conformation by the angle ψ between the
local tangent vector and the z axis or by the deformation h in the transverse

−

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

11

direction deﬁned in Fig. 11.

The energetics of the ﬁlament pair is due to the bending elasticity. In
addition to ﬁlament bending, we also take into account internal stresses due
to the active elements (dyneins). We characterize them by the force per
unit length f (s) acting at position s in opposite directions on the two micro-
tubules. This force density corresponds to a shear stress within the cilium
which tends to slide the two ﬁlaments with respect to each other.

The local curvature is C = ∂sψ (see Fig. 11). The sliding displacement,

∆(s, t) is related to the the sliding displacement at the base ∆0(t) by ∆(s, t)
∆0(t) = aψ(s, t), because we impose the boundary condition ψ(0, t) = 0.

occurring with a connection of elasticity k.

The tangent component of the integrated forces acting on the ﬁlament

2-state model for the cilium

Following (8), we now introduce the 2-states model of coupled molecular
motors (22, 23) to describe the internal mechanism of the cilium. This model
allows the calculation of the shear force f due to the dyneins.

Each motor has two diﬀerent chemical states, a strongly bound state,

a ﬁlament in both states are characterized by potential energy landscapes
W1(x) and W2(x), where x denotes the position of a motor along the ﬁlament.
The potentials have the ﬁlament symmetry: they are periodic with period

(with barrier height U
a ﬂat potential W2 representing a weakly bound state. Here, for simplicity,
we use the symmetric potentials:

)

Although this choice is somehow arbitrary, we checked that the ﬁnal results
only depend qualitatively on the actual shape of the potentials and of the
rates deﬁned below.

When a number of motors act together to propel a ﬁlament, however,
the direction of motion is a collective property. The ﬁlament might move
in either direction (23). The absence of asymmetry in the potentials implies
that an individual motor is not able to move directionally. It is not the case
for an assembly of motors: even with a symmetric potential, provided that
detachment can only take place at a localized position near the bottom of a
potential well, oscillations can occur.

If we assume that the motors are uniformly distributed along the ﬁlaments

occurs with a large amplitude. Nevertheless, this approximation allows us
to extract interesting information on the parameters controlling the beating.
Moreover, the work of Hilﬁnger shows that larger amplitude beating patterns
are very similar to small amplitude patterns (20). We must however keep
in mind that our approach is valid only if the the system stays close to an

The non-linear terms are not important here but they will turn out important

In the absence of any external ﬂow the beating is symmetric and the Fourier
components n=0 and n=2 of h vanish for symmetry reasons. Close to the
oscillation bifurcation threshold, cilium beating is dominated by the ﬁrst
Fourier component n = 1.

The boundary conditions are explicitly discussed in appendix II. The
condition for existence of non vanishing solutions is given by equation 63 of
Appendix II. This is a complex equation, that gives therefore two conditions
which determine both the the critical value of the distance from equilibrium
where the oscillations start Ωc, and the reduced oscillation frequency ¯ωc. The
critical value Ωc is a Hopf bifurcation threshold: there are no oscillations if
Ωc. At the bifurcation
Ω
Ωc and cilium beating is only possible if Ω
threshold, the amplitude of the oscillations vanishes.
It is not possible to
calculate the amplitude of the oscillations above the bifurcation threshold
with the linear theory presented here. This requires a complete determination
of the third order terms in the equation of motion which goes far beyond the
scope of this work. This very complex problem is attacked in the work of
Hilﬁnger and J¨ulicher (20).

≥

An analytical determination of the Hopf bifurcation threshold and of the
beating frequency at the threshold does not seem to be possible analytically.
We therefore rely on a numerical solution, choosing reasonable values of the
various parameters.

is higher than the water viscosity in order to take into account the proteins
above the cell body. We estimate κ = 4 10−22J.m corresponding to 20 mi-
crotubules (24). The other parameters are l = 10nm, a = 20nm, U = 10kT ,
0, ρ = 5 108m−1, and λ = 1P a.s very similar to those of (7). In order
K
to match the typical frequency observed in Paramecium, and to obtain a
realistic pattern of the beating, we take ξ⊥ = 35.5η = 142 10−3P a.s and we
choose k = 6.54Nm2, γ = 7.31 ηwater, and ν = 600s−1.

The value of ξ⊥ is rather high, but it must include the hydrodynamic
interactions of the cilium with the cell surface (see (25)) which are not taken
into account if we use the classical friction per unit length of a rod.

A detailed study shows that the equation giving the bifurcation threshold
and the beating frequency has several solutions. (Ω(n)

. A ﬁrst guess would be that the axoneme starts beating at the lowest
c
threshold (Ω(1)
c ). However, it is known experimentally that during the
c
beating the deformation waves propagate from the base to the tip and not
from the tip to the base (26). The ﬁrst two oscillating modes correspond
to waves propagating in the opposite direction.
In order to be consistent
with the experiments we do not consider them here. A better choice of the
transition rates ω1 and ω2, would perhaps allow to justify this choice. The
direction of propagation of the wave is extremely sensitive to the boundary
conditions. We have allowed here basal sliding as suggested by some exper-
iments and we have imposed that the cilium is clamped at its base with an
angle ψ = 0. This also seems consistent with some experiments analyzed
in (20). The other extreme limit of a completely free cilium (a vanishing
external torque at the base) leads to a wave propagating form the base to
the tip for the ﬁrst mode. We have tried to use an intermediate boundary
condition where the torque at the base is an elastic torque and varying the
related stiﬀness, however we were not able to obtain a beating pattern look-
ing like the experimental one. We therefore proceed, considering only the
third beating mode.

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

18

The beating frequency fc varies with the viscosity of the medium. Ex-
perimentally, when methyl-cellulose is added in water, the viscosity increases
signiﬁcantly. We predict here a decrease of fc with increasing external vis-
cosity as observed in the experiments of (27) and in numerical simulations
(28) (see Table 1). We observe an approximate linear decrease of the beating
frequency when plotted against log(η/ηw) as in the simulations performed in
(28) (we ﬁnd similar values for the frequency).

The eﬀect of [Ca2+] on the beating pattern can also be studied qualita-
tively. As mentioned in the introduction, [Ca2+] has a strong inﬂuence on
the beating pattern. Calcium concentration variations are at the basis of
the shock responses of many organisms, changing the ciliary-type beating
into a ﬂagellar-type beating in Chlamydomonas, or switching the directions
of eﬀective stroke and recovery stroke in Paramecium, or in reversing the
direction of the ”wave” propagation on the ﬂagellum and thus reversing the
direction of the movement in Chritidia (29).

This last example can be explained qualitatively within our approach. In
Chritidia, both directions are possible for the deformation wave propagation.
Calcium may aﬀect the chosen mode of beating, allowing the system to choose
Ω(1)

c and its tip-to-base pattern instead of Ω(3)
c

.

On the other hand, calcium is also likely to change the attachment/ de-
tachment rate (and thus change the parameter ν) or the boundary conditions
at the base of the cilium (and thus change k). In Chlamydomonas, calcium
has a contractile eﬀect on the striated ﬁbers connecting the basal bodies of
the two ﬂagella (30). These changes induce a change in the beating pattern,
and may result in a switch from base-to-tip to tip-to-base wavelike propaga-
tion.

4 Left-right beating symmetry breaking

In the presence of a transverse external ﬂow, the beating can no longer be
symmetrical as sketched on Fig. 5. The cilium tends to beat faster and
quite straight in the direction of the ﬂow, whereas it comes back slower and
more curved against the ﬂow. This looks like a two-phases beating with an
eﬀective and a recovery stroke.

If the beating is asymmetrical, the cilium exerts a force in the ﬂuid that
can itself produce a ﬂow. In a certain range of parameters, one can therefore
expect that a continuous ﬂow is spontaneously generated by hydrodynamic

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

19

interactions between cilia: an assembly of cilia, beating symmetrically, is
able to break spontaneously this left-right symmetry of the beating to create
a global ﬂow. This idea of a spontaneous breaking spontaneously of the
left-right symmetry has already been suggested in (31) with a more abstract
system (called rowers) having two internal energy states.

In this section, we ﬁrst study the eﬀect of an external velocity imposed
by the experimentalist on the beating symmetry of a single cilium. We
then consider an array of aligned cilia and determine the conditions under
which this assembly of cilia breaks its left-right symmetry and generates a
global ﬂow. Metachronal coordination between cilia naturally emerges from
hydrodynamic couplings as a local minimum of the oscillation threshold Ωc.

4.1 External breaking of the beating symmetry: cilium

submitted to an external ﬂow

We impose an external ﬂow ~V = V ~ex along the x axis for simplicity.
It
is found experimentally that the velocity above the cilia sub-layer is time
independent and uniform (15), justifying our choice. This ﬂow is in this ﬁrst
part externally ﬁxed and we consider the limit of vanishingly small ﬂows.

The force per unit length exerted by the cilium on the ﬂuid ~fv[ ~X(s)]

depends on the external velocity ~V .

~fv[ ~X(s)] = (ξk~t ~t + ξ⊥~n ~n) (∂t ~X(s)

in the equation of motion. The boundary conditions do not depend on the
external ﬂow.

As above, we expand the deformation of the cilium h in Fourier compo-
nents in time. Using the same notations as before, the equation of motion of
the Fourier components can be written as

In the limit of small external velocities, we have neglected terms of order ¯V 2.
The equation for the ﬁrst mode is identical to Eq. 61, with the same
boundary conditions. At this order in ¯V , the fundamental mode is not af-
fected by the external ﬂow. Consequently, the oscillation threshold and the
beating frequency are the same as in the absence of ﬂow and the Fourier
component h1 is given by Eq. 24.

c.c. is plotted against ¯s at diﬀerent times equally spaced on Fig. 7. In order
to stress the fact that the beating is easier and faster in the direction of the
ﬂow, and more diﬃcult and slower against the ﬂow, we have chosen rather
large values of the parameters, ¯ξ = 1,
A1 = 1/5 and ¯V = 2, and we plot
¯h(¯s, t) for ¯s
The external ﬂow thus breaks the left-right symmetry in two ways. First
the average position of the cilium is not the vertical axis but a cilium curved
in the direction of the ﬂow. Second, the beating itself is no longer left-right
symmetric: the cilium goes faster in the direction of the ﬂow and comes
back slower against the ﬂow. The beating pattern looks like a two-phases
beating with an eﬀective stroke and a recovery stroke. The external ﬂow may
therefore be an important factor in the asymmetry of the beating.

∈

Another important result, is that, because the beating propagates a base-
to-tip deformation, the curved cilium exerts a ﬁnite average force in the ﬂuid

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

22

in the direction of the ﬂow. Thus, if an external ﬂow breaks the left-right
beating symmetry, the cilia create a force in its direction and can amplify
this ﬂow. This is the basis of the left-right spontaneous symmetry breaking
that we discuss in the next section.

The external ﬂow is not always the only source of symmetry breaking.
If it were so, a Paramecium would always go in the same direction once it
started moving. This is not the case, this organism is able to go backward
when it bumps into an obstacle thanks to the release of calcium that reverses
the beating.

The calculations of this section have been made with a velocity ~V uniform
over the cilium length. This is not consistent with the presence of a cell wall
where the cilium is anchored. Nevertheless, the main idea was to study how
an external ﬂow can break the beating symmetry in the simplest way. Similar
calculations can be performed with a linearly varying velocity ~V = U ¯z; they
do not lead to any new physical eﬀects.

4.2 Spontaneous breaking of the beating symmetry:

array of aligned cilia

We now consider a regular array of cilia on a cell body, beating all in the same
direction. Starting from a symmetrical beating, we show that the left-right
symmetry is spontaneously broken within a certain range of the parameters
controlling the beating due to the hydrodynamic couplings between cilia.

4.2.1 Equations of motion

For a cilium located in the xy plane at position ~r, we call ~V [ ~X(s)] the velocity
created by the other cilia at the point ~X(s) of arclength s. The equation of
motion of the cilium is similar to that obtained previously with an external
ﬂow ﬁeld and we write up to third order in h as

4.2.2 Beating pattern and metachronal waves

We ﬁrst study the equation of motion of the ﬁrst Fourier mode in Eq. 41,
which corresponds to the oscillatory motion of the cilium. The right hand
side of this equation of motion does not vanish due to the existence of an
oscillatory external ﬂow due to the other cilia. Note however that we have
not treated in details the hydrodynamic interactions for one cilium and that
we have only taken them into account through the two local friction coeﬃ-
cients ξ⊥ and ξk. We are here more interested in the qualitative aspects of
the coordination between cilia than in the accurate calculation of the ﬂows
created by each cilium.

The eﬀect of the hydrodynamic interactions between cilia is embodied here
in the coeﬃcient γ(ϕ). The variation of this coeﬃcient with the phase dif-
ference ϕ is similar to that of
(ϕ). The limit where γ(ϕ) = 0, leads back
to the previous situation were one cilium is beating alone; it may however
correspond to the ﬁnite phase shifts between cilia ϕ = ϕs or ϕa.

The four boundary conditions on ¯h1 can as before be written in a ma-
trix form and the oscillation threshold and the beating frequency can be
determined as the zeros of a determinant insuring the consistency of this
matrix equation. This leaves an unknown amplitude of the beating motion
that could only be calculated by expanding the equation of motion to higher
order. The beating pattern can then be written as

The values of both the oscillation threshold Ωc and the frequency ¯ωc de-
pend on the phase shift between cilia ϕ, through γ(ϕ). We ﬁrst discuss the
variation of this bifurcation point with the constant γ(ϕ) which is a more
convenient variable. On Fig. 9, we plot Ωc and the critical frequency fc

There is a local minimum of Ωc for γ∗

We here need a selection criterion that determines the value of the phase
shift between cilia. The simplest conjecture for the selection criterion is that
the system chooses the local minimum of Ωc corresponding to γ∗
1.15.
This corresponds to a metachronal wave propagating in the assembly of cilia,
as widely conﬁrmed by experimental observations ((26, 27) for instance).

5 Discussion and concluding remarks

We have studied in this paper how hydrodynamic interactions between cilia
contribute to the coordination of the beating motion in ciliated cells. Three
major eﬀects have been studied, the spontaneous alignment of an array of
cilia, the breaking of the symmetry of the beating and the appearance of a
macroscopic ﬂow and the existence of metachronal waves. We have shown
for all these problems that there exist a dynamic transition where symmetry
is broken and where a coordination between the beating of neighboring cilia
appears.

Our work is based on several simplifying approximations that we believe
make the analysis tractable analytically but that should preserve the essential
physical eﬀects. We only studied hydrodynamic interactions between distant
cilia that can be treated by introducing simple distribution of forces in the
ﬂuid to describe the motion of one cilium. This is rarely true experimentally
but the hydrodynamic interactions between closer cilia are even stronger and
strongly favor the transitions that we study. We have replaced the complex
architecture of the axoneme by two microtubules sliding against one another
under the action of dynein motors which are described by a two state model
for molecular motors as done earlier by Camalet and J¨ulicher. This is a rather
sketchy description but it allows a calculation of the internal forces that drive
the cilium motion and it gives some physical insight. Future work will have to
take into account the nine-fold symmetry of the axoneme and the inﬂuence
of its central doublet. Finally, we have only considered small amplitude
beating. This is suﬃcient to determine the oscillation threshold but it does
not allow a quantitative comparison between the calculated beating and the
experimental one that often occur far from any threshold. All our results are
qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations and for example
the beating frequency is close to both the experimental ones and to the ones
obtained in numerical simulations (32).

The essential result of our work is the natural emergence of metachronal
waves and of a macroscopic ﬂow created by an array of cilia if the ampli-
tude of beating is large enough. The criterion for appearance of the global
uniform component of the ﬂow given by Eq. 50 requires only very small am-
5 10−4) which means that as long as the left-right symmetry
plitudes (

A1 ≥

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

30

is broken, a macroscopic ﬂow should appear. An essential ingredient for the
macroscopic ﬂow to appear is that the constant Cϕ deﬁned in Eq. 48 be
positive so that the average force created by one cilium favors the ﬂow and
does not oppose it (which occurs if ϕ = 0).

As long as we allow a constant phase shift between neighboring cilia we
observe metachronal coordination as a consequence of hydrodynamic inter-
actions and of the internal beating mechanism of the cilium. A selection
criterion is then needed for these waves. We have conjectured that the ex-
isting metachronal wave is the one that corresponds to the local minimum
of the oscillation threshold. A more complete calculation that goes far be-
yond the scope of this work would have to consider the nucleation of the
metachronal wave and to determine the fastest growing wave. One of the
interesting predictions of our calculation is that the existence of metachronal
waves leads to a ﬂow which is far more stationary than if all the cilia were
beating in synchrony. The oscillating component of the ﬂow is proportional
(ϕ) (see Eq. 40) which has a much smaller value when
to the constant
0.07) than if all cilia are beating in syn-
metachronal waves exist (
4.52). Metachronism thus contributes to the creation
(0) =
chrony (
of a very steady movement of swimming organisms that could for example
make easier the detection of the organism environment.

Our most important conclusion is the idea that metachronism and the
existence of macroscopic ﬂow around ciliated organisms can exist as self-
organized phenomena driven by hydrodynamic couplings. We must stress
however that other mechanisms could be at the origin of these cooperative
eﬀects.

Appendix I: Average force created by a single
beating cilium in a viscous ﬂuid

The aim of this appendix is to calculate the force and momentum averaged
over one time period created by a general periodic beating of a single cilium.
We make two assumptions: the beating is planar and there is a stationary
external ﬂow. In section 4, the average ﬂow is created by the neighboring

Flow, alignment and metachronal waves among cilia

31

cilia.

We call φ the angle between the plane of beating and the direction of
the external ﬂow ~V that we take along the x axis. The cilium of length L
is located at the origin and it is ﬁxed at its basis. We denote by h(s, t) the
distance between a point at arclength s on the cilium and the z axis at time
t and by Z(s, t) the distance between a point at the arclength s on the cilium
and the xy plane. The angle between the tangent vector ~t to the cilium and
the z axis is denoted by ψ(s, t) (see Fig. 11). The coordinates of the tangent
vector are ~t = (cos φ sin ψ, sin φ sin ψ, cos ψ). The angle ψ is related to the
cilium deformation h by sin ψ = ∂sh

The point on the cilium at the arclength s is located at position ~X =

(x, y, z), with:

x = cos φ

du sin ψ(u, t) = h(s, t) cos φ

y = sin φ

du sin ψ(u, t) = h(s, t) sin φ

z =

The velocity of this point is calculated by derivation with respect to time,

the Frenet basis (~t, ~n,~b) is:

~f = (ξk~t ~t + ξ⊥~n ~n + ξ⊥~b ~b)(~v

(51)

where ξk and ξ⊥ are the two local friction coeﬃcients for tangential and
normal motion respectively. We decompose this force as a sum of two forces,

ference between the two local friction coeﬃcients ξ⊥ and ξk is at the basis of
the ﬂow generation by an assembly of beating cilia. Indeed, this is because
the shape of the beating in the eﬀective stroke is diﬀerent from that in the
recovery stroke that a force can be exerted in the ﬂuid on average.

It is important to note that < f f low

The last term of f f low
is a static term, whereas the ﬁrst positive term depends
on the beating pattern and reduces the eﬀects of this static term.
In an
assembly of cilia, the external velocity is due to the beatings of the other
cilia which are themselves created by the forces on these cilia.

In section 2, we introduce a viscous coeﬃcient α which characterizes the
tendency for a cilium, beating in a plane at an angle φ with the ﬂow, to
align with the other cilia. A torque along the z axis due to the ﬂow M f low

a) Beating pattern of a single cilium showing the Eﬀective Stroke (ES), where
the ﬂuid is eﬃciently propelled, and the slower Recovery Stroke (RS), where
the cilium comes back close to the surface to minimize the viscous eﬀects. b)
Eﬀective force in the ﬂuid ~f applied at a height h above the cell membrane,
to mimic the cilium beating.

Square lattice of cilia with a distance d between two neighboring cilia. Cilium
j exerts on the ﬂuid a force f in the direction φj; θji = ( ~ex, ~eji) where ~eji is
the unit vector from cilium j to cilium i.

Two ﬁlaments (full curves) ~X and ~X ′ at constant separation a are rigidly
connected at the bottom end where s = 0. Internal forces f (s) are exerted
in opposite directions, tangential to the ﬁlaments. The displacement ∆ at
the tip is indicated.

Approximate cilium deformation ¯h(¯s, t) at diﬀerent times steps (correspond-
ing to diﬀerent colors) during a beating period. The beating is symmetrical
with respect to the vertical axis. Deformations are propagating from base to
tip. With

A1 = 1/70 the maximum deformation is ¯hmax ≃

0.14.

Abstract

Nurzia, G., Scrimaglio, R., Spataro, B., Zirilli, F. The use of a syncytium model of the
crystalline lens of the human eye to study the light ﬂashes seen by astronauts. Radiat.
Res.

A syncytium model to study some electrical properties of the eye is proposed in the
attempt to explain the phenomenon of anomalous Light Flashes (LF) perceived by as-
tronauts in orbit. The crystalline lens is modelled as an ellipsoidal syncytium having
a variable relative dielectric constant. The mathematical model proposed is given by a
boundary value problem for a system of two coupled elliptic partial diﬀerential equations
in two unknowns. We use a numerical method to compute an approximate solution of this
mathematical model and we show some numerical results that provide a possible (qualita-
tive) explanation of the observed LF phenomenon. In particular, we calculate the energy
lost in the syncytium by a cosmic charged particle that goes through the syncytium and
compare the results with those obtained using the Geant 3.21 simulation program. We
study the interaction antimatter-syncytium. We use the Creme96 computer program to
evaluate the cosmic ray ﬂuxes encountered by the International Space Station.

1 INTRODUZIONE

In the next few years the average time spent on the International Space Station by human
beings will substantially increase. For this reason the safety of human life in the space
environment is crucial. There is a need to study the eﬀects of cosmic rays particles on the
human body and particularly on the functionality of the Central Nervous System (CNS).
The visual system has been chosen to “probe” the CNS because it is particularly
sensitive to space environment.
In missions Apollo 11 through 17, Skylab 4, Apollo-
Soyuz, Mir, Iss, the astronauts, after some minutes of dark adaptation, observed brief
ﬂashes of white light (LF phenomenon) with the shape of thin or thick streaks, single or
multiple dots, clouds, etc. (1-3).

The speciﬁc mechanism of the interaction between ionizing particles and the visual
system remains uncertain. In order to evaluate the LF phenomenon it is necessary the
simultaneous determination of time, nature, energy and trajectory of the particle passing
through the cosmonaut eyes, as well as the cosmonaut LF perception time. Some previous
experiments are described in (4-6).

A future experiment, named ALTEA (7-10), will be activated on the International
Space Station in 2005. The ALTEA project is aimed at the study of the transient and
long term eﬀects of cosmic particles on the astronaut cerebral functions.
It has been
funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and by the italian National Institute for Nuclear
Physics (INFN) and “Highly recommended” by the European Space Agency (ESA). The
experiment is an international and multidisciplinary collaboration.

The basic instrumentation is composed by a series of active particles telescopes, an
ElectroEncephaloGrapher (EEG) and a visual stimulator, arranged in a helmet shaped
device. This instrumentation is able to measure simultaneously the dynamics of the
functional status of the visual system, the cortical electrophysiological activity, and the
passage through the brain of those particles whose energy is included in a predetermined
window. The three basic instruments can be used separately or in any combination,
permitting several diﬀerent experiments.

In this paper we analyze a mathematical model able to describe some electrical prop-
erties of the eye. It is based on a mathematical model of syncytial tissues, that is tissues
where many cells are electrically coupled one to the other and to an extracellular medium.
We note that multicellular syncytia are used to model important tissues such as, for ex-
ample, the eye lens (11-14). We use the model of syncytial tissues presented in (12), (14)
to suggest a mathematical explanation of the LF phenomenon. We note that the eye lens
is only a part of the eye and that in the scientiﬁc literature more sophisticated models
of the eye exist, see for example (15). Finally we have pointed out the sensitivity of the
electrical behaviour of the proposed syncytium model respect to the direction of the par-
ticle passing through the astronaut visual system. In particular, we have calculated the
energy lost in the syncytium by a cosmic charged particle going through the syncytium
as a function of the direction of motion of the particle and we have compared the results
obtained with the syncytium model with those obtained using the Geant 3.21 simulation
program.

In section 2 we describe a mathematical model of a syncitial tissue that describes some
electrical properties of the crystalline lens and a numerical method to approximate the
solution of the model presented. In section 3 we describe the relative dielectric constant
of the crystalline lens. In section 4 we show some numerical results obtained from the
numerical solution of the model that could provide a qualitative explanation of the LF
phenomenon. In section 5 we describe the interaction between antimatter and syncytium.
In section 6 we show the cosmic ray ﬂuxes within the Iss obtained using the Creme96 pro-
gram. In section 7 we describe the Geant simulation of the phenomenon under scrutiny
and compare the results obtained with Geant 3.21 with those obtained using the syn-
cytium model. In section 8 we calculate the adsorbed and equivalent energy doses in the
crystalline lens due to cosmic radiation. In section 9 some simple conclusions are drawn.

support D. Let U (e)(x), U (i)(x), x

The boundary value problem (1), (2), (3), (4) has a unique solution pair U (e)(x),
U (i)(x), x
D. However this solution can not be computed explicitely and an approx-
imation method must be used to evaluate U (e)(x), U (i)(x) in D.
In particular for the
computation of an approximation of U (e)(x), U (i)(x) in D we have rewritten problem (1),
(2), (3), (4) in spherical coordinates and we have approximated the solution using the
ﬁnite diﬀerence method. Let ρ

Let Nρ, Nθ, Nϕ > 1 be the number of points of the uniform discretization grid in spherical
coordinates used in the ﬁnite diﬀerence method along the coordinates ρ, θ, ϕ respectively,
then from problem (1), (2), (3), (4) we obtain a linear system of (2Nρ −

The components of the vector solution of this linear system are an approximation of the
functions U (e)(x), U (i)(x) on the previously described grid points.

These values are taken from (12) and they are relative to the frog eye. This is a
starting point. The study of the problem with parameters relative to the human eye will
probably give results qualitatively similar to those obtained with the data of Table 1.
However the values of the human eye parameters are not available to us at the moment.
Moreover we have chosen xI = (0, 0, 1.6)t mm and Nρ = Nθ = Nϕ = 30. In the next
sections the values of the electric current, frequency and relative dielectric constant used
in our work are shown.

3 THE RELATIVE DIELECTRIC COSTANT

In the macroscopic approach the biological tissues are generally considered as media that
interact with the electric ﬁeld induced by the external environment in two diﬀerent ways:
(1) generating electric currents of conduction that increase with the conductivity of tissues;
(2) producing polarization eﬀects that depend on the local dielectric constant. For this
reason, from an electromagnetic point of view, biological tissues can be considered as di-
electric media able to store and dissipate the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁelds involved.
According to electromagnetic theory the physical quantity that characterizes these mech-
anisms is the complex relative dielectric constant. The real part of this constant takes
into account the temporary storage of energy in the medium, while the imaginary part,
depending on the conductivity σ, is responsible for the dissipation of the electromagnetic
energy.

In this work we assume the crystalline lens of the frog eye to be a perfect dielectric
(σ = 0), so that the relative dielectric costant ǫr has not imaginary part and is the
square of the refraction index. The crystalline has the shape of a thin biconvex lens, is
constituted by a very transparent and very elastic substance and has a concentric shell
structure. Since the crystalline lens has variable density, ǫr is variable too.

Applying the ﬁnite diﬀerence method, we obtain a series of ellipsoidal shells with
constant eccentricity equal to e. Let ρ to be the distance from the centre of the ellipsoid
D (origin of the coordinates system) calculated along a semiaxis. A shell is determined
by a value of the variable ρ. Then we suppose ǫr to be costant whithin every shell and
given by:

ǫr = ǫc −

(ǫc −
where ǫc = 1.98 and ǫs = 1.89 are the values in the centre (ρ = 0) and on the boundary
of the ellipsoid (determined by the shell having ρ = a) respectively. The variation of ǫr
between the centre and the boundary of the ellipsoid is 4.76%. Figure 1 shows the relative
dielectric costant vs. ρ.

ǫs),

Let l to be the index corresponding to a value of the ρ variable. Then l determines
the values of the semiaxes of the lthshell, al and bl. In this way the distance between a
point on shell and the origin is:

The variable that enters in the equations of the electric potentials is rl. In the case of the
spherical syncytium (14) we have rl = al when θ

[0, π].

A theory describing the ocular lens as a radially nonuniform spherical syncytiym is
proposed, solved and described as a simple equivalent circuit in (13). In this paper the
syncytium consists of a nucleus with one eﬀective intracellular resistivity surrounded by
a cortex with another resistivity.

4 THE ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND THE ENERGY LOST IN THE SYN-
CYTIUM

We study the electric potentials of the syncytium with variable density as a function of the
incidence direction of the cosmic charged particle. The incidence point xI = (0, 0, z)t
∂D is located on the North pole of the ellipsoidal syncytium.

∈

Let α be the incidence angle on the crystalline lens measured respect to the positive
z axis. When α = 90◦ the particle direction of motion is tangent to the ellipsoid and the
interaction eﬀect is minimum. When α = 180◦ the particle direction of motion is along
the semiaxis of length a and the interaction eﬀect is maximum.

7

Figure 2 shows the electrical behavior of the syncytium model respect to the choice
of three diﬀerent directions for the electric current when f = 3 Hz and I = 7 µA. This
value of the electric current comes from the comparison with the Geant 3.21 simulation
if we imagine that the incident cosmic particle is a proton (see section 7, Table 2). In
Figure 2 we can see the shining eﬀect when the electric potentials assume high values.

We have calculated the gradients of the electric potentials using the ﬁnite diﬀerence
method in spherical coordinates. The energy lost by a cosmic charged particle in the
intracellular and extracellular compartments of the syncytium is respectively:

Figure 3 shows the behavior of the energy lost in the intracellular compartment (I),
in the extracellular compartment (E) and in the whole syncytium (T) vs.
frequency of
the electric current. We suppose ǫr to be constant in the range of frequencies considered.
We have chosen α = 45◦ in order to have a mean trajectory of the cosmic particle in the
syncytium.

Figure 4 shows the behavior of the energy lost vs.

intensity of the electric current

when α = 45◦.

In Figure 5 the most important result of this paper is shown, that is the energy lost in
the syncytium vs. incidence angle α of the cosmic charged particle. These are symmetric
curves respect to the line α = 90◦ because the system is symmetric with respect to the
z axis. We can see that the energy lost reaches the maximum value when the incidence
angle of the cosmic charged particles is 180◦. The minimum value is reached for α = 90◦.
Based on this fact we can suppose that the LF phenomenon occurs when cosmic charged
particles pass through the astronaut visual system with a incidence angle of approximately
180◦.

5 INTERACTION ANTIMATTER-SYNCYTIUM

When we consider the interaction between antimatter and syncytium, the right hand side
of eq.(2) must be changed because of the possible annihilation process. We can write:

8

Figure 2: The electric potentials U (e)(x), U (i)(x) in the plane x = 0. We have chosen
the directions α = 60◦, 90◦ and 180◦, the frequency f = 3 Hz and the electric current
I = 7 µA. In order to do a comparison between the potentials corresponding to diﬀerent
incidence directions, in each column the values of the potentials are normalized to the
absolute maximum and minimun values. In this way the resulting values are dimensionless
and are represented on a grey scale between 0 (dark grey) and 1 (bright grey). The bars
are drawn with the normalized values. Then in each column the same linear grey-scale
is used, but for ﬁgures on diﬀerent columns diﬀerent scales are used. But the numbers
written below the bars are the real maximum and minimum values of the electric potentials
and they are expressed in millivolts. We can see that when these values are high a shining
eﬀect exists.

where m is the mass of the antiparticle and g is a constant depending on the antiparticle
expressed in V/N. This constant will be determined experimentally in space. It is linked
to cross section of the annihilation process. When g = 0 we are considering matter;
when g = 1 we suppose that all the antiparticles entering in the syncytium undergo
the annihilation phenomenon. The true value of g is much smaller than 1 since the
antiparticles that we consider are ﬂying.

In order to study the antimatter eﬀect in the syncytium, we have chosen the most
favourable case (g = 1). We have seen that the eﬀect of the annihilation process on the
xI) in
value of energy lost in the syncytium is negligible. In fact the source term kδ(x
eq.(10) is much smaller than the other term when the current intensity I is of order of
µA (see section 7, Table 2).

6 THE EVALUATION OF THE COSMIC RAY FLUXES

We used the Creme96 computer program to evaluate the cosmic ray ﬂuxes within the
International Space Station. Creme96 is a package of computer programs to create nu-

11

merical models of the ionizing radiation environment in near Earth orbits and to evaluate
the resulting radiation eﬀects on electronic systems in spacecrafts and in high altitude
ﬂying aircrafts (17-19).

The diﬀerential ﬂuxes, in minimum solar condition, are shown in Figure 6. There is
a strong predominance of protons and alpha particles with respect to heavier nuclei and
a great predominance of protons with respect to alpha particles when the kinetic energy
is below 1 GeV/nucl. The maximum value for protons ﬂux is near 102 MeV/nucl. The
remaining particles have maximum values near 103 MeV/nucl.

Figure 6: Cosmic ray diﬀerential ﬂuxes vs. kinetic energy within the ISS.

7 THE GEANT SIMULATION

In order to control the reliability of the syncytium model, we have developed a simulation
with the Geant 3.21 program.

The Geant 3.21 program simulates the passage of elementary particles through matter.
This program originally designed for High Energy Physics experiments (HEP), today it
has found applications also outside this domain in areas such as medical and biological
sciences, radioprotection and astronautics.

The principal applications of Geant in HEP are:
(1) the transport of particles through an experimental setup for the simulation of the

detector response;

(2) the graphical representation of the setup and of the particle trajectories.

12

These two functions are combined in the interactive version of Geant. This is very
useful, since the direct observation of what is happening to a particle inside the detector
makes the debugging easier and may reveal possible weakness of the setup.

The Geant 3.21 program system can be obtained from CERN, European Organization
for Nuclear Research, in http://cernlib.web.cern.ch/cernlib/version.html and the program
runs everywhere the CERN Program Library is installed.

We remember that in (6) at least two causes of Light Flashes are hypothesized, one
due to protons and the other due to heavy nuclei. For this reason we have developed a
lot of simulations using the Geant 3.21 program.

In our simulation the incident particles are generated in a random way and isotropically
on a big spherical surface with the crystalline lens in the centre. The lens is represented
by a uniform sphere of water with the ray equal to a because the Geant 3.21 program
can not simulate an ellipsoid. The energy of a particle is chosen in a random way within
the cosmic ray spectrum obtained using the Creme96 program (Figure 6), so that events
are distributed according to this spectrum. The direction of a particle is isotropically
generated in a random way.

Figure 7 shows events distribution vs. energy lost for cosmic protons that hit a sphere

of water obtained by using the Geant 3.21 program.

Figure 7: Events distribution vs. energy lost when a cosmic proton hits a sphere of water.
The energy is expressed in MeV.

Table 2 shows the comparison between the Geant simulation and the syncytium model.
We remember that the sphere has radius a and the ellipsoid has semiaxes a and a/2. In the
ﬁrst column we report the kind of particle considered in the Geant simulations. The second

13

column shows the average energy lost in a sphere of water of radius a calculated by Geant.
In the third column there is the electrical current that in a uniform spherical syncytium
with ǫr = 1 yield a lost of energy (fourth column) almost equal to the one calculated by
Geant. The ﬁfth, sixth and seventh columns show the energy lost in the intracellular and
extracellular compartments and in the whole ellipsoidal syncytium respectively having
the parameters reported in Table 1 and the variable density described in section 3. In the
last column we show the ratio between the energies lost in the spherical and ellipsoidal
syncytia. We can see that the energy lost in an uniform spherical syncytium is almost three
times greater then the energy lost in the ellipsoidal syncytium having variable relative
dielectric constant described previously. This diﬀerence is due to the diﬀerence in volume
and in the dielectric constant ǫr.

The comparison between the Geant simulation and the syncytium model indicates the

reliability of the latter in the study of some electrical properties of the eye.

8 THE SPACE RADIATION EFFECTS

The health risk to astronauts from cosmic rays radiation determines the maximum lenght
of space missions. As a consequence it is very important to evaluate the eﬀects of charged
particles on organs of the human body. It is necessary to have a set of dosimetric codes to
convert the radiation environment within spacecrafts into radiation protection quantities,
which can be used to evaluate astronaut risk when exposure limits have been established.
These limits exist for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) only. For missions beyond the protection
of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, risk increases. In each case the shielding of spacecrafts is
basic.

We studied the eﬀects of cosmic radiation on an “eye” simulated by Geant 3.21 pro-

gram.

14

We remember some deﬁnitions. The absorbed dose D1 is the quantity which measures
the total energy absorbed per unit mass and is the fundamental parameter in radiological
protection. Then we have:

D1 =

∆EG
MG

,

(12)

where MG is the mass of the uniform sphere of water simulated by Geant. The unit of
D1 is the Gray which is deﬁned as 1 Gy = 1 J/kg.

The absorbed dose describes the physical eﬀect of the incident radiation, but it gives
no information on the rate of absorption and on the speciﬁc type of the radiation. These
factors are very important when considering the biological eﬀects of radiation, then D1
is an inadequate quantity. For example, an absorbed dose of α particles produces more
damage than an equal dose of protons, and a given dose of protons produces more damage
than a similar dose of electrons or γ-rays. In fact diﬀerent particles deposit locally diﬀerent
energy per unit path lenght. Thus the particles with bigger ionizing power yield a greater
local biological damage.

For considering this eﬀect, to each radiation type is assigned a radiation weighting
factor, w (20). The factors are independent from tissue type, are experimentally deter-
mined and have stochastic character. The quality factor of a radiation type is deﬁned as
the ratio between the biological damage produced by the absorption of 1 Gy of that type
of radiation and the biological damage produced by 1 Gy of X or γ radiation.

Then the equivalent dose, H, is obtained multiplying the value of the absorbed dose,

averaged over the entire tissue or organ, by the radiation weighting factor:

H = D1 ×

w.

The equivalent dose expresses long-term risk (primarily cancer and leukemia) from low-
level chronic exposure.

The unit of equivalent dose is the Sievert (Sv) which has the same dimensions as the
Gray (J/kg), but now 1 Sv of α particles produces approximately the same eﬀect as 1 Sv
of X or γ-rays, etc. Howewer the equivalent dose is not a quantity directly measurable
while the absorbed dose is directly observable.

If more than one radiation type is present, the total biological eﬀect suﬀered by a

tissue or organ is:

(13)

(14)

where DR is the average absorbed dose received by the organ from the radiation type R
having a weighting factor equal to wR.

Table 3 shows the absorbed and the equivalent dose in the crystalline lens (uniform
sphere of water) relative to the average energy lost calculated by the Geant simulation.
Then we obtain Htot = 74.575 µSv.

Table 4: Absorbed and equivalent energy doses in the crystalline lens corresponding to the
average energy lost in 1 year calculated by Geant simulation.

In order to give an idea of character of the numbers of Table 4, we cite the dose limits
as recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)
(20). Two sets of limits are deﬁned: one for individual exposed occupationally and one
for the general public. For the lens of eye the limits are 150 mSv/yr (occupational) and 15
mSv/yr (general public). These are allowable doses in addition to the natural background
dose. In radiotherapy the doses given to the tumour are typically around 100 to 200 Sv

16

per treatment.

Examples of use of codes for calculating the dosimetric quantities for several near

Earth environments can be found in (21).

Results of measurements of the absorbed and equivalent dose on board aircrafts, space-
crafts and space station Mir can be found in (22). A discussion of the planned radiation
measurement on the International Space Station is given in (23).

9 CONCLUSIONS

The comparison with the results obtained with the Geant simulation program shows that
the modellization of part of the human visual system with an ellipsoidal syncytium is
promising. The work presented in this paper suggests that this model can be used in the
qualitative study of some unexpected phenomena such as the Light Flashes observed by
the astronauts.

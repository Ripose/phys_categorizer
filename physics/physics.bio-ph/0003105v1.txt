ABSTRACT The regulation of cellular function is often controlled at the level

of gene transcription. Such genetic regulation usually consists of interacting

networks, whereby gene products from a single network can act to control their

own expression or the production of protein in another network. Engineered

control of cellular function through the design and manipulation of such networks

lies within the constraints of current technology. Here we develop a model

describing the regulation of gene expression, and elucidate the eﬀects of noise

on the formulation. We consider a single network derived from bacteriophage

λ, and construct a two-parameter deterministic model describing the temporal

evolution of the concentration of λ repressor protein. Bistability in the steady-

state protein concentration arises naturally, and we show how the bistable regime

is enhanced with the addition of the ﬁrst operator site in the promotor region.

We then show how additive and multiplicative external noise can be used to

regulate expression.

In the additive case, we demonstrate the utility of such

control through the construction of a protein switch, whereby protein production

is turned “on” and “oﬀ” using short noise pulses. In the multiplicative case, we

show that small deviations in the transcription rate can lead to large ﬂuctuations

in the production of protein, and describe how these ﬂuctuations can be used

to amplify protein production signiﬁcantly. These novel results suggest that

an external noise source could be used as a switch and/or ampliﬁer for gene

expression. Such a development could have important implications for gene

therapy.

Introduction

Regulated gene expression is the process through which cells control fundamental functions,

such as the production of enzymatic and structural proteins, and the time sequence of this

production during development [1, 2]. Many of these regulatory processes take place at the

level of gene transcription [3], and there is evidence that the underlying reactions governing

transcription can be aﬀected by external inﬂuences from the environment [4].

As experimental techniques are increasingly capable of providing reliable data pertaining

to gene regulation, theoretical models are becoming important in the understanding and

manipulation of such processes. The most common theoretical approach is to model the

interactions of elements in a regulatory network as biochemical reactions. Given such a

set of chemical reactions, the individual jump processes (i.e., the creation or destruction

of a given reaction species) and their associated probabilities are considered.

In its most

general form, this often leads to a type of Monte Carlo simulation of the interaction proba-

bilities [5]. Although this approach suﬀers from a lack of analytic tractability, its strength

is its completeness – ﬂuctuations in species’ concentrations are embedded in the modeling

process. These internal ﬂuctuations are important for systems containing modest numbers

of elements, or when the volume is small.

Rate equations originate as a ﬁrst approximation to such a general approach, whereby

internal ﬂuctuations are ignored. These deterministic diﬀerential equations describe the evo-

lution of the mean value of some property of the set of reactions, typically the concentrations

of the various elements involved. The existence of positive or negative feedback in a regu-

latory network is thought to be common [6], and, within the reaction framework, feedback

leads to nonlinear rate equations [7].

Noise in the form of random ﬂuctuations arises in these systems in one of two ways. As

discussed above, internal noise is inherent in the biochemical reactions.

Its magnitude is

proportional to the inverse of the system size, and its origin is often thermal. On the other

hand, external noise originates in the random variation of one or more of the externally set

2

control parameters, such as the rate constants associated with a given set of reactions. If the

noise source is small, its eﬀect can often be incorporated post hoc into the rate equations. In

the case of internal noise, this is done in an attempt to recapture the lost information embod-

ied in the rate equation approximation. But in the case of external noise, one often wishes

to introduce some new phenomenon where the details of the eﬀect are not precisely known.

In either case, the governing rate equations are augmented with additive or multiplicative

stochastic terms. These terms, viewed as a random perturbation to the deterministic pic-

ture, can induce various eﬀects, most notably the switching between potential attractors

(i.e., ﬁxed points, limit cycles, chaotic attractors) [8].

While impressive progress has been made in genome sequencing and the understand-

ing of certain qualitative features of gene expression, there have been comparatively few

advancements in the quantitative understanding of genetic networks. This is due to the

inherent complexity of such biological systems. In this work, we adopt an engineering ap-

proach in studying a solitary gene network. We envision that a plasmid, or genetic applet [9],

containing a small, self-contained gene regulatory network, can be designed and studied in

isolation. Such an approach has two distinct advantages. First, since the approach is inher-

ently reductionist, it can make gene network problems tractable and thus more amenable

to a mathematical formulation. Secondly, such an approach could form the basis for new

techniques in the regulation of in vivo gene networks, whereby a genetic applet is designed

to control cellular function.

In this paper, we develop a model describing the dynamics of protein concentration in

such a genetic applet, and demonstrate how external noise can be used to control the net-

work. Although our results are general for networks designed with positive autoregulation,

we ground the discussion by considering an applet derived from the promotor region of bac-

teriophage λ. Since the range of potentially interesting behavior is wide, we focus primarily

on the steady-state mean value of the concentration of the λ repressor protein. This choice

is motivated by experiment; detailed dynamical information is still rather diﬃcult to obtain,

3

as are statistical data concerning higher moments. We show how an additive noise term

can be introduced to our model, and how the subsequent Langevin equation is analyzed by

way of transforming to an equation describing the evolution of a probability function. We

then obtain the steady-state mean repressor concentration by solving this equation in the

long time limit, and discuss its relationship to the magnitude of the external perturbation.

This leads to a potentially useful application, whereby one utilizes the noise to construct a

genetic switch. We then consider noise at the level of transcription, where noise enters the

formulation in a multiplicative manner. As in the additive case, we transform to an equation

describing a probability distribution, and solve for the steady-state mean concentration as a

function of noise strength. Finally, we demonstrate how such a noise source can be used to

amplify the repressor concentration by several orders of magnitude.

A Model for Repressor Expression

In the context of the lysis-lysogeny pathway in the λ virus, the autoregulation of λ repressor

expression is well-characterized [10]. In this section, we present two models describing the

regulation of such a network. We envision that our system is a plasmid consisting of the

PR − PRM operator region and components necessary for transcription, translation, and
degradation.

Although the full promotor region in λ phage contains the three operator sites known

as OR1, OR2, and OR3, we ﬁrst consider a mutant system whereby the operator site OR1

is absent from the region. The basic dynamical properties of this network, along with

a categorization of the biochemical reactions, are as follows [10]. The gene cI expresses

repressor (CI), which in turn dimerizes and binds to the DNA as a transcription factor. In

the mutant system, this binding can take place at one of the two binding sites OR2 or OR3.

(Here, we ignore nonspeciﬁc binding.) Binding at OR2 enhances transcription, which takes

place downstream of OR3, while binding at OR3 represses transcription, eﬀectively turning

oﬀ production.

4

The chemical reactions describing the network are naturally divided into two categories

– fast and slow. The fast reactions have rate constants of order seconds, and are therefore

assumed to be in equilibrium with respect to the slow reactions, which are described by rates

of order minutes. If we let X, X2, and D denote the repressor, repressor dimer, and DNA

promoter site, respectively, then we may write the equilibrium reactions

2X

K1⇀↽ X2

D + X2

K2⇀↽ DX2

D + X2

K3⇀↽ DX ∗

2

DX2 + X2

K4⇀↽ DX2X2

(1)

where the DX2 and DX ∗

2 complexes denote binding to the OR2 or OR3 sites, respectively,

DX2X2 denotes binding to both sites, and the Ki are forward equilibrium constants. We let

K3 = σ1K2 and K4 = σ2K2, so that σ1 and σ2 represent binding strengths relative to the

dimer-OR2 strength.

The slow reactions are transcription and degradation,

DX2 + P kt

X

→ DX2 + P + nX
→ A

kd

(2)

where P denotes the concentration of RNA polymerase and n is the number of proteins per

mRNA transcript. These reactions are considered irreversible.

If we consider an in vitro system with high copy-number plasmids∗, we may deﬁne con-

centrations as our dynamical variables. Letting x = [X], y = [X2], d = [D], u = [DX2],

v = [DX ∗

2 ], and z = [DX2X2], we can write a rate equation describing the evolution of the

concentration of repressor,

˙x = −2k1x2 + 2k−1y + nktp0u − kdx + r

(3)

∗This assumption is necessary since the number of relevant molecules per cell is small in vivo. Since there

are many cells, we could alternatively use state probabilities as dynamical variables describing an in vivo

system.

5

where we assume that the concentration of RNA polymerase p0 remains constant during

time. The parameter r is the basal rate of production of CI, i.e., the expression rate of the

cI gene in the absence of a transcription factor.

We next eliminate y, u, and d from Eq. (3) as follows. We utilize the fact that the

reactions in Eq. (1) are fast compared to expression and degradation, and write algebraic

expressions

y = K1x2

u = K2dy = K1K2dx2

v = σ1K2dy = σ1K1K2dx2

z = σ2K2uy = σ2(K1K2)2dx4

Further, the total concentration of DNA promoter sites dT is constant, so that

dT = d + u + v + z = d(1 + (1 + σ1)K1K2x2 + σ2K 2

1 K 2

2 x4)

Under these assumptions, Eq. (3) becomes

˙x =

nktp0dtK1K2 x2

1 + (1 + σ1)K1K2x2 + σ2K 2

2 x4 − kdx + r

1 K 2

(4)

(5)

(6)

Without loss of generality, we may eliminate two of the parameters in Eq. (3) by rescaling

the repressor concentration x and time. To this end, we deﬁne the dimensionless variables

ex = x√K1K2 and et = t(r√K1K2). Upon substitution into Eq. (3), we obtain

α x2

˙x =

1 + (1 + σ1)x2 + σ2x4 − γ x + 1

(7)

where the time derivative is with respect to et and we have suppressed the overbar on
x. The dimensionless parameter α ≡ nktp0dT /r is eﬀectively a measure of the degree in
which the transcription rate is increased above the basal rate by repressor binding, and

γ ≡ kd/(r√K1K2) is proportional to the relative strengths of the degradation and basal

rates.

6

For the mutant operator region of λ phage, we have σ1 ∼ 1 and σ2 ∼ 5 [10, 11], so that
the two parameters α and γ in Eq. (7) determine the steady-state concentration of repressor.

For this equation, there are two types of behavior. For one set of parameter values, we have

monostability, whereby all initial concentrations evolve to the same ﬁxed-point value. For

another set, we have three ﬁxed points, and the initial concentration will determine which

steady state is selected. Additionally, in the multiple ﬁxed-point regime, stability analysis

indicates that the middle ﬁxed point xm is unstable, so that all initial values x < xm will

evolve to the lower ﬁxed point, while those satisfying x > xm will evolve to the upper. This

bistability arises as a consequence of the competition between the production of x along with

dimerization and its degradation. For certain parameter values, the initial concentration is

irrelevant, but for those that more closely balance production and loss, the ﬁnal concentration

is determined by the initial value.

Graphically, we can see how bistability arises in Eq. (7) by setting α x2/(1+2 x2 +5 x4) =
γ x − 1. In Fig. 1A we plot the functions α x2/(1 + 2 x2 + 5 x4) and γ x − 1 for ﬁxed α
and several values of the slope γ. We see that for γ small (whereby degradation is minimal

compared with production), there is one possible steady-state value of x (and therefore CI).

As we increase γ above some critical value γL, we observe that three ﬁxed-point values

appear. As we increase γ still further beyond a second critical value γU , the concentration

“jumps” to a lower value and the system returns to a state of monostability.

The preceding ideas lead to a plausible method whereby the system may be experimen-

tally probed for bistability. We envision that α is ﬁxed by the transcription rate and DNA

binding site concentration, and that the degradation parameter γ is an adjustable control.

Beginning with a low initial value of γ = γ0 = 5, we slowly increase the degradation rate.

The eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 1B. We see that as γ is slowly increased, the concentration

of CI slowly decreases as the system tracks the ﬁxed point. Then, at the moment when γ

is greater than γU , the concentration abruptly jumps to a lower value, followed by a further

slow increase. Now suppose we reverse course, and begin to decrease γ. Then the system

7

will track along the lower ﬁxed point until a point when γ is greater than γL. At this point,

the system will again jump, this time to a higher ﬁxed-point value. The trademark of hys-

terisis is that the two jumps, one when increasing γ and the other when decreasing, occur

for diﬀerent values of γ.

As is well-known, the full operator region of λ phage contains three sites. We turn brieﬂy

to the eﬀect of the additional site OR1 on the above network. In order to incorporate its

eﬀect, Eq. (1) must be generalized to account for additional equilibrium reactions. This

generalization amounts to the incorporation of dimer binding to OR1 [10], and permutations

of multiple binding possibilities at the three operator sites. Then, using known relationships

between the cooperative binding rates, the above steps can be repeated and an equation

analogous to Eq. (7) constructed. We obtain

˙x =

α (2 x2 + 50 x4)

25 + 29 x2 + 52 x4 + 4 x6 − γ x + 1

(8)

As can be seen, the addition of OR1 has the eﬀect of changing the ﬁrst term on the right-

hand side of the equation. While this augmentation does not aﬀect the qualitative features

of the above discussion, one important quantitative diﬀerence is depicted in Fig. 1B. In this

ﬁgure, we see that the addition of OR1 has a large eﬀect on the bistability region, increasing

the overall size of the region by roughly an order of magnitude. Additionally, the model

predicts that, while the drop in the concentration of repressor at the ﬁrst bifurcation point

will be approximately the same in both cases, the jump to the higher concentration will be

around ﬁve times greater in the system containing OR1. Finally, since one eﬀect of a larger

bistable region is to make the switching mechanism more robust to noise, these results are

of notable signiﬁcance in the context of the lysogeny-to-lysis switching of λ phage.

Additive Noise

We now focus on parameter values leading to bistability, and consider how an additive ex-

ternal noise source aﬀects the production of repressor. Physically, we take the dynamical

8

variable x described above to represent the repressor concentration within a colony of cells,

and consider the noise to act on many copies of this colony. In the absence of noise, each

colony will evolve identically to one of the two ﬁxed points, as discussed above. The pres-

ence of a noise source will at times modify this simple behavior, whereby colony-to-colony

ﬂuctuations can induce novel behavior.

An additive noise source alters the “background” repressor production. As an example,

consider the eﬀect of a randomly varying external ﬁeld on the biochemical reactions. The

ﬁeld could, in principle, impact the individual reaction rates [12, 13], and since the rate

equations are probabilistic in origin, its inﬂuence enters statistically. We posit that such an

eﬀect will be small and can be treated as a random perturbation to our existing treatment;

we envision that events induced will aﬀect the basal production rate, and that this will

translate to a rapidly varying background repressor production. In order to introduce this

eﬀect, we generalize the aforementioned model such that random ﬂuctuations enter Eq. (8)

linearly,

˙x = f (x) + ξ(t)

(9)

where f (x) is the right-hand side of Eq. (8), and ξ(t) is a rapidly ﬂuctuating random term

with zero mean (< ξ(t) >= 0). In order to encapsulate the rapid random ﬂuctuations, we

make the standard requirement that the autocorrelation be “δ-correlated”, i.e., the statistics

of ξ(t) are such that < ξ(t)ξ(t′) >= Dδ(t − t′), with D proportional to the strength of the
perturbation.

Eq. (9) can be rewritten as

˙x = −

∂φ(x)

∂x

+ ξ(t)

(10)

where we introduce the potential φ(x), which is simply the integral of the right-hand side of

Eq. (7). φ(x) can be viewed as an “energy landscape”, whereby x is considered the position

of a particle moving in the landscape. One such landscape is plotted in Fig. 2A. Note that

the stable ﬁxed values of repressor concentration correspond to the minima of the potential

9

φ in Fig. 2A, and the eﬀect of the additive noise term is to cause random kicks to the particle

(system state point) lying in one of these minima. On occasion, a sequence of kicks may

enable the particle to escape a local minimum and reside in a new valley.

To solve Eq. (10), we introduce the probability distribution P (x, t), which is eﬀectively

the probability of ﬁnding the system in a state with concentration x at time t. Given Eq. (10),

a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for P (x, t) can be constructed [14]

∂tP (x, t) = −∂x(f (x)P (x, t)) +

D
2

∂x

2P (x, t)

(11)

We focus here on the value of the steady-state mean (ssm) concentration. To this end, we

ﬁrst solve for the steady-state distribution, obtaining

Ps(x) = Ae−

2

D φ(x)

(12)

where A is a normalization constant determined by requiring the integral of Ps(x) over all x

be unity. In Fig. 2B, we plot Ps(x), corresponding to the landscape of Fig. 2A, for two values

of the noise strength D. It can be seen that for the smaller noise value the probability is

distributed around the lower concentration of repressor, while for the larger noise value the

probability is split and distributed around both concentrations. This is consistent with our

conceptual picture of the landscape: low noise will enable only transitions from the upper

state to the lower state as random kicks are not suﬃcient to climb the steep barrier from the

lower state, while high noise induces transitions between both of the states. Additionally,

the larger noise value leads to a spreading of the distribution, as expected.

Using the steady-state distribution, the steady-state mean (ssm) value of x ≡< x >ss is

given by

< x >ss=Z ∞

0

xAe−

2

D φ(x)dx

(13)

In Fig. 2C, we plot the ssm concentration as a function of D, obtained by numerically

integrating Eq. (13) and transforming from the dimensionless variable x to repressor concen-

tration. It can be seen that the ssm concentration increases with D, corresponding to the

10

increasing likelihood of populating the upper state, as discussed previously with respect to

Figs. 2A and B.

Figure 2C indicates that the external noise can be used to control the ssm concentration.

As a candidate application, consider the following protein switch. Given parameter values

leading to the landscape of Fig. 2A, we begin the switch in the “oﬀ” position by tuning the

noise strength to a very low value. This will cause a high population in the lower state, and

a correspondingly low value of the concentration. Then at some time later, consider pulsing

the system by increasing the noise to some large value for a short period of time, followed

by a decrease back to the original low value. The pulse will cause the upper state to become

populated, corresponding to a concentration increase and a ﬂipping of the switch to the “on”

position. As the pulse quickly subsides, the upper state remains populated as the noise is

not of suﬃcient strength to drive the system across either barrier (on relevant time scales).

To return the switch to the oﬀ position, the upper-state population needs to be decreased to

a low value. This can be achieved by applying a second noise pulse of intermediate strength.

This intermediate value is chosen large enough so as to enhance transitions to the lower

state, but small enough as to remain prohibitive to upper-state transitions.

Figure 2D depicts the time evolution of the switching process for noise pulses of strengths

D = 1.0 and D = 0.05.

Initially, the concentration begins at a level of [CI] = 10 nM,

corresponding to a low noise value of D = 0.01. After six hours in this low state, a 30-

minute noise pulse of strength D = 1.0 is used to drive the concentration to a value of

[CI] ∼ 58 nM. Following this burst, the noise is returned to its original value. At 11 hours,
a second 90-minute pulse of strength D = 0.05 is used to return the concentration to its

original value.

Multiplicative Noise

We now consider the eﬀect of a noise source which alters the transcription rate. Although

transcription is represented by a single biochemical reaction, it is actually a complex sequence

11

of reactions [16], and it is natural to assume that this part of the gene regulatory sequence

is likely to be aﬀected by ﬂuctuations of many internal or external parameters. We vary the

transcription rate by allowing the parameter α in Eq. (8) to vary stochastically, i.e., we set

α → α + ξ(t). In this manner, we obtain an equation describing the evolution of the protein
concentration x

˙x = h(x) + ξ(t)g(x)

where h(x) is the right-hand side of Eq. (8), and

g(x) ≡

2 x2 + 50 x4

25 + 29 x2 + 52 x4 + 4 x6

(14)

(15)

Thus, in this case, the noise is multiplicative, as opposed to additive, as in the previous case.

Qualitatively, we can use the bifurcation plot of Fig. 3A to anticipate one eﬀect of allowing

the parameter α to ﬂuctuate. Such a bifurcation plot is yet another way of depicting the

behavior seen in Fig. 1A; it can be seen that for certain values of α there is one unique

steady-state value of repressor concentration, and that for other values there are three.

To incorporate ﬂuctuations, if we envision α to stochastically vary in the bistable region

of Fig. 3A, we notice that the steep top branch implies the corresponding ﬂuctuations in

repressor concentration will be quite large. This is contrasted with the ﬂat lower branch,

where modest ﬂuctuations in α will induce small variations. In order to verify this observation

quantitatively, we simulated Eq. (14), the results of which are presented in Fig. 3B. Beginning

with repressor concentration equal to its upper value of approximately 500 nM, we notice

that the immediate ﬂuctuations are quite large even though α varies by only a few percent

(Fig. 3A). Then, at around 700 minutes, the concentration quickly drops to its lower value,

indicating that the ﬂuctuations envisioned in Fig. 3A were suﬃcient to drive the repressor

concentration to the dotted line of Fig. 3A and oﬀ the upper branch (across the unstable

ﬁxed point). The ﬁnal state is then one of very small variation, as anticipated.

As in the previous section, the steady-state probability distribution is obtained by trans-

12

forming Eq. (14) to an equivalent Fokker-Planck equation [14],

∂tP (x, t) = −∂x(h(x) +

D
2

g(x)g ′(x))P (x, t) +

D
2

∂2
ug2(u)P (x, t)

(16)

where the prime denotes the derivative of g(x) with respect to x. We again solve for the

steady-state distribution, obtaining

Ps(x) = Be−

2

D φm(x)

(17)

As before, the steady-state distribution can be used to obtain the ssm concentration.

Although not originating from a deterministic equation like that of Eq. (7), the function

φm(u) in Eq. (17) can still be viewed as a potential. We now consider parameter values

leading to one such landscape in Fig. 3C. This landscape implies that we will have two

steady-state repressor concentrations of approximately 5 and 1200 nM. This large diﬀerence

is due to the largeness of the parameter α, implying that repressor “induced” transcription

ampliﬁes the basal rate by a large amount. (Since dT enters in the numerator of the deﬁnition

of α, one could construct such a system experimentally with a high copy-number plasmid).

This feature suggests that multiplicative noise could be used to amplify protein production,

as described in the following example. We begin with zero protein concentration and very

low noise strength D, leading to a highly populated lower state and low overall concentration.

Then, at some later time, we pulse the system by increasing D for some short interval. This

will cause the upper state to become quickly populated as it is easy to escape the shallow

valley of the landscape and move into the large basin.

In Fig. 3D, we plot the temporal

evolution of the mean repressor concentration obtained from the simulation of Eq. (14). We

see that the short noise pulse at around 20 hours indeed causes the concentration to increase

abruptly by over three orders of magnitude, making this type of ampliﬁcation an interesting

case for experimental exploration.

Discussion

From an engineering perspective, the control of cellular function through the design and

manipulation of genetic regulatory networks is an intriguing possibility. In this paper, we

have shown how external noise can be used to control the dynamics of a regulatory network,

and how such control can be practically utilized in the design of a genetic switch and/or

ampliﬁer. Although the main focus of this work was on a network derived from the promotor

region of λ phage, our approach is generally applicable to any autoregulatory network where

a protein-multimer acts as a transcription factor.

An important element of our control scheme is bistability. This implies that a neces-

sary criterion in the design of a noise-controlled applet be that the network is poised in a

bistable region. This could potentially be achieved by methods such as the utilization of a

temperature-dependent repressor protein, DNA titration, SSRA tagging, or pH control.

Physically, the noise might be generated using an external ﬁeld.

Importantly, it has

been claimed that electromagnetic ﬁelds can exert biological eﬀects [15]. In addition, recent

theoretical [13] and experimental [12] work suggests a possible mechanism whereby an electric

ﬁeld can alter an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. These ﬁndings suggest that, although there is

global charge neutrality, an external ﬁeld can interact with local dipoles which arise through

transient conformational changes or in membrane transport.

Current gene therapy techniques are limited in that transfected genes are typically ei-

ther in an “on” or “oﬀ” state. However, for the eﬀective treatment of many diseases, the

expression of a transfected gene needs to be regulated in some systematic fashion. Thus, the

development of externally-controllable noise-based switches and ampliﬁers for gene expres-

sion could have signiﬁcant clinical implications.

FIG. 1. Bifurcation plots for the variable x and concentration of λ repressor. (A) Graph-

ical depiction of the ﬁxed points of Eq. (7), generated by setting ˙x = 0 and plotting
α x2/(1 + 2x2 + 5x4) and the line γx − 1. As the slope γ is increased, the system traverses
through a region of multistability and returns to a state of monostability. (B) Hysterisis

loops for the mutant and nonmutant systems obtained by setting ˙x = 0 in Eqs. (7) and (8).

Beginning with concentrations of 35 nM for the mutant system and 85 nM for the nonmutant

system, we steadily increase the degradation parameter γ. In both systems, the concentration

of repressor slowly decreases until a bifurcation point. In the mutant (nonmutant) system,

the repressor concentration abruptly drops to a lower value at γ ∼ 16 (γ ∼ 24). Then,
upon reversing course and decreasing γ, the repressor concentration increases slowly until γ

encounters a second bifurcation point at γ ∼ 14 (γ ∼ 6), whereby the concentration immedi-
ately jumps to a value of 15 nM (mutant) or 70 nM (nonmutant). The subsequent hysterisis

loop is approximately 10 times larger in the nonmutant case. Parameter values are α = 50,

K1 = 0.05 nM−1, and K2 = 0.026 nM−1 for the mutant system, and K2 = 0.033 nM−1 for

the nonmutant system [10].

FIG. 2. Results for additive noise with parameter values α = 10 and γ = 5.5. (A) The energy

landscape. Stable equilibrium concentration values of Eq. (8) correspond to the valleys at

[CI] = 10 and 200 nM, with an unstable value at [CI] = 99 nM. (B) Steady-state probability

distributions for noise strengths of D = 0.04 (solid line) and D = 0.4 (dotted line). (C) The

steady-state equilibrium protein concentration plotted versus noise strength. The concentra-

tion increases as the noise causes the upper state of (A) to become increasingly populated.

(D) Simulation of Eq. (9) demonstrating the utilization of external noise for protein switch-

ing. Initially, the concentration begins at a level of [CI] = 10 nM corresponding to a low

noise value of D = 0.01. After six hours, a large 30-minute noise pulse of strength D = 1.0

is used to drive the concentration to 58 nM. Following this pulse, the noise is returned to

17

its original value. At 11 hours, a smaller 90-minute noise pulse of strength D = 0.04 is used

to return the concentration to near its original value. The simulation technique is that of

Ref. [17].

FIG. 3. Results for multiplicative noise. (A) Bifurcation plot for the repressor concentration

versus the model parameter α. The steep upper branch implies that modest ﬂuctuations in

α will cause large ﬂuctuations around the upper ﬁxed value of repressor concentration, while

the ﬂat lower branch implies small ﬂuctuations about the lower value. (B) The evolution of

the repressor concentration in a single colony, obtained by simulation of Eq. (14). Relatively

small random variations of the parameter α (∼ 6%) induce large ﬂuctuations in the steady-
state concentration until around 700 minutes and small ﬂuctuations thereafter. (C) Energy

landscape for parameter values α = 100 and γ = 8.5. (D) Large-scale ampliﬁcation of the

protein concentration obtained by simulation of Eq. (14). At 20 hours, a 60-minute noise

pulse of strength D = 1.0 is used to quickly increase the protein concentration by over three

orders of magnitude. The parameter values are the same as those in (C).

The main advantage of two-photon ﬂuorescence confocal microscopy is the
low absorption obtained with live tissues at the wavelengths of operation.
However, the resolution of two-photon ﬂuorescence confocal microscopes is
lower than in the case of one-photon excitation. The 4Pi microscope type C
working in two-photon regime, in which the excitation beams are coherently
superimposed and, simultaneously, the emitted beams are also coherently
added, has shown to be a good solution for increasing the resolution along
the optical axis and for reducing the amplitude of the side lobes of the point
spread function. However, the resolution in the transverse plane is poorer
than in the case of one-photon excitation due to the larger wavelength in-
volved in the two-photon ﬂuorescence process. In this paper we show that a
particular arrangement of the 4Pi microscope, referenced as 4Pi’ microscope,
is a solution for obtaining a lateral resolution in the two-photon regime sim-
ilar or even better to that obtained with 4Pi microscopes working in the
one-photon excitation regime.

1 Introduction

Indeed,

Strong eﬀorts have been made in the last decade to improve the resolution
localizing marked species with sub-
of ﬂuorescence microscopes.
wavelength accuracy gives precious information for cell biology applications.
In particular, in ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments made with
confocal microscopes, varying the detection volume is the key task for study-
ing, at diﬀerent scales, molecular mechanisms inside cells [1, 2, 3]. For re-
ducing the lateral extent of the detection volume, high numerical aperture
immersion objectives have been developed [4]. However, the axial extent of
the point spread function (PSF) of conventional confocal microscopes remains
about four times larger than its lateral extent. To solve this problem, various
solutions, mostly based on the use of interference phenomena, have been pro-
posed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular the coherent superposition of the excitation
wavefronts and that of the emission wavefronts passing through two oppos-
ing lenses, has led to the development of the 4Pi microscope [10, 11]. It has
been shown that, with 4Pi microscopes working with one-photon excitation,
the axial resolution can be improved by a factor 3 to 7 over that of confocal
microscopes and related systems [12]. However, with this technique, the fo-
cal maximum is also accompanied by interference side lobes whose maximum
intensity exceeds 50% of the maximum intensity in the focal point. In this
case classical image deconvolution algorithms do not work properly and the
resolution along the optical axis is not improved. To overcome this diﬃculty,
various solutions have been proposed. Among them one can cite the 4Pi type
C microscope with two-photon excitation [13, 14, 15] . In this set-up, two
opposite microscope objectives are used to illuminate coherently the ﬂuores-
cent sample from both sides and, simultaneously, to add coherently the two
emitted beams. The PSF is the result of the superposition of two systems
of fringes: the one produced by the pump beams, the other produced by the
emitted beams. The strong diﬀerence between the pump wavelength and
the wavelength of luminescence in the two-photon excitation regime leads to
diﬀerent intensity spatial distributions of the fringes along the optical axis.
The consequence is that a strong reduction of the amplitude of the side lobes
of the PSF is obtained. This is a very interesting solution which strongly
improves the resolution along the optical axis while preserving the main ad-
vantage of two-photon excitation which is the low absorption of live tissues at
the wavelength of operation [13, 16]. However, due to the larger wavelength
of the pump beams used in the two-photon excitation regime, the transverse

2

resolution is worse than in the case of one-photon excitation [14, 15]. Other
solutions based on the used of variable density ﬁlters for shaping the axial
component of the PSF have also been proposed [17].

Recently it has been shown theoretically that a particular arrangement
of 4Pi microscope, referenced as 4Pi’ microscope [18], made possible an in-
crease of the lateral resolution in one-photon excitation regime. In the present
paper we extend the domain of application of the 4Pi’ microscope. We de-
scribe the vector model that can be used to compute the image of a dipole
through the 4Pi’ microscope. Thanks to numerical simulations based on this
model, we show that the 4Pi’ microscope working in the two-photon regime
cumulates the advantages of the 4Pi microscope working with one-photon
regime and those given by two-photon excitation. In particular numerical,
calculations show that the excitation volume of the 4Pi’ type C microscope
working with two-photon excitation is comparable to or even smaller than
the excitation volume obtained with 4Pi type C microscopes working in the
one-photon excitation regime. The main advantage of this solution is that
it keeps a high resolution when the pinhole size increases, leading to high
signal-to-noise ratio for practical applications.

2 Set-up

In 4Pi microscopes the axial extent of the PSF is reduced, with respect
to classical confocal microscopes, by taking advantage of the variation of
the optical path diﬀerence (OPD) along the optical axis between the pump
beams (case of 4Pi type A microscopes), between the emitted beams (case
of 4Pi type B microscopes) or between both the pump beams and the emit-
ted beams (case of 4Pi type C microscopes) [11].The displacement of the
luminescent source in the transverse direction has no inﬂuence on the OPD
between the emitted beams. Thus, for identical microscope objectives and
similar exit pupil diameters, the resolution is improved only along the op-
tical axis and the lateral extent of the PSF of 4Pi microscopes is identical
to that of classical confocal microscopes working at the same excitation and
emission wavelengths. Recently a conﬁguration of the 4Pi microscope, called
4Pi’ microscope, has been proposed [18]. In this microscope an interference
phenomenon is produced by the displacement of the luminescent source in
the transverse direction. This interference phenomenon is used to reduce the
lateral extent of the PSF. The set-up is represented in Fig. 1. It is based on

a 4Pi microscope in which an image inversion has been added in one arm.
The pump laser is assumed to be transverse monomode TEM00 in order to
ensure the spatial coherence of the two incident beams which interfere as in
a classical 4Pi microscope. The beam is expanded in order to give a constant
illumination within the aperture of the objectives. We assume that the OPD
between the two incident beams is equal to 0 in the common focal focus F of
the microscope objectives. We also assume that the chromatic dispersion in
the two arms is perfectly compensated. In order to point out the diﬀerences
between the 4Pi microscope and the 4Pi’ microscope we have represented,
in Fig. 2, the equivalent optical schemes of the two arrangements. We have
considered a single dipole source placed in the vicinity of the common focus
F of the two microscope objectives. In the 4Pi microscope and in the 4Pi’
microscope the two beams emitted by dipole D pass through the objectives.
In both microscopes the displacement of dipole D from focus F creates a

second virtual source. However, the location of this virtual source depends
on the arrangement (see Fig. 2). In the 4Pi microscope the two beams are
emitted by dipole D and by the virtual source ID. In the 4Pi’ microscope
the two beams are emitted by dipole D and by the virtual source ID’. D
and ID are symmetric with respect to focal the plane FP of the microscope
objectives, while D and ID’ are symmetric with respect to focus F. All the
diﬀerences between the 4Pi microscope and the 4Pi’ microscope lie on these
two diﬀerent symmetries.

For comparing the CEF of the 4Pi microscope with that of the 4Pi’ micro-
scope, for a source located around focus F, taking into account the vector
nature of the dipolar emission, it is necessary to use a complete description of
the image formation through the microscope objectives. We have calculated

4 Numerical simulations

In order to study a case of practical interest, we have considered the case
of Oregon Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) ﬂuorophores that can be
pumped at 976 nm (=2x488 nm) in the two-photon excitation regime and at
488 nm in the one-photon excitation regime. The wavelength of emission of
these ﬂuorophores is around 525 nm. These excitations can be produced, at
488 nm, by an Argon ion laser and at 976 nm by a pulsed laser diode (for
example 980 LDH-P, PicoQuant, Berlin, GER). We have studied the cases of

8

one-photon excitation and two-photon excitation for the 4Pi microscope and
for the 4Pi’ microscope. In order to take into account the broad ﬂuorescence
spectrum whose width is around 30 nm, we have made a numerical calcula-
tion by summing incoherently ACEF(r) given by Eq. (15) for all wavelengths
of the interval [510 nm, 540 nm]. The results obtained have shown to be very
similar to the results obtained in the monochromatic case at the mean wave-
length λ=525 nm. For this reason and for reducing the calculation time,
we have considered a monochromatic emission. For the calculations we have
considered an oil (n=1.52) immersion microscope objective with an eﬀective
numerical aperture NA=1.3, a magniﬁcation m=40 and a pinhole diameter
equal to 20 µm. In this case the size of the pinhole equals the size of the Airy
disk. Using Eq. (15) we have computed the longitudinal section of ACEF(r)
for the 4Pi and for the 4Pi’ microscope. The results are represented in Fig.
4. One can see the diﬀerences between the distributions of the ACEF due to
the diﬀerent symmetries introduced by the two arrangements and described
in Fig. 2.

Fig. 5 shows the section of ACEF(r) in the focal plane. One can see
that a signiﬁcant improvement of the resolution is obtained with the 4Pi’
microscope. The strength of this eﬀect depends on the pinhole size and van-
ishes completely for very small pinhole sizes. No new spatial frequencies are
introduced by the method. This eﬀect is due to the symmetry of the inter-

of this eﬀect can be found in Ref.
[18]. The more the pinhole diameter
increases, the more the improvement obtained with the 4Pi’ microscope in-
creases. The curves of Fig. 4 and of Fig. 5 are representative of the case
of a pinhole diameter equal to the diameter of the Airy disk. With respect
to solutions based on the use of variable density ﬁlters in the pinhole, or
based on the use of pinholes much smaller than the size of the Airy disk, the
it keeps a high
solution presented in this paper oﬀers a main advantage :
lateral resolution even when the pinhole size increases, leading to a better
signal-to-noise ratio in practical applications. In order to calculate the emis-
sion eﬃciency function in the one-photon and in the two-photon excitation
regimes, we have considered an incident constant illumination at 488 nm and
at 976 nm on the surfaces of the microscope objectives. The beams are polar-
ized along x axis. Fig. 6 represents the section of EEF(r) given by Eq. (17)
and Eq. (18) in two perpendicular longitudinal planes. In order to quantify
the improvement obtained with a 4Pi’ microscope working in the two-photon
regime in terms of resolution along both transverse and longitudinal direc-
tions, we have computed the Molecule Detection Eﬃciency Function. In Fig.
7 we have calculated the MDEF in diﬀerent cases. For the calculations we

detection, referred to as ”4Pi microscopy of type C”, which has proved to
be a powerful solution for reducing the amplitude of the side lobes of the
MDEF [16]. MDEF(r) was calculated using Eq. (16). One can see that the
lateral extent of the MDEF of a 4Pi’ microscope working in the two-photon
excitation regime is almost two times smaller than the lateral extent of the
MDEF of a 4Pi microscope working in the same conditions.

From the curves of Fig. 8, one can see that, for a 4Pi’ microscope
working in the two-photon excitation regime, the amplitude of the side-lobes
of the MDE along the optical axis is even smaller than the one obtained with
the classical 4Pi microscope working in the same conditions. But the main
point is that the lateral resolution obtained with the 4Pi’ type C microscope
working in the two-photon regime is similar or even better to the one ob-
tained with the 4Pi type C microscope working with one-photon excitation.
Similar calculations made with diﬀerent numerical apertures and diﬀerent
wavelengths lead to the same conclusions. Moreover, one can notice that, for
a pump beam linearly polarized, the section of the detection volume in the
focal plane is more symmetric with the 4Pi’ microscope than with the 4Pi
microscope.

5 Conclusion

The numerical results presented in this paper have shown that the lateral
resolution obtained with the 4Pi’ type C microscope working in the two-
photon excitation regime is comparable to that obtained with classical con-

amplitude of the side lobes obtained with the 4Pi’ type C microscope with
two-photon excitation is comparable to or even smaller than the amplitude
of the side lobes obtained with the 4Pi type C microscope working in the
same conditions. The 4Pi’ microscope, which is suitable for scanning setups,
oﬀers the advantages given by the use of two-photon excitation, but with a
transverse resolution very close to the resolution obtained with one-photon
excitation. These conclusions have been made on the basis of numerical
results obtained by using a vector theory of diﬀraction. An experimental
characterization of the resolution obtained with the 4Pi’ microscope has to
be made in order to conﬁrm these predictions.

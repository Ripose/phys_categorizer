Abstract

Single molecule experiments on single- and double stranded DNA have sparked a

renewed interest in the force-extension of polymers. The extensible Freely Jointed

Chain (FJC) model is frequently invoked to explain the observed behavior of single-

stranded DNA. We demonstrate that this model does not satisfactorily describe

recent high-force stretching data. We instead propose a model (the Discrete Persis-

tent Chain, or “DPC”) that borrows features from both the FJC and the Wormlike

Chain, and show that it resembles the data more closely. We ﬁnd that most of

the high-force behavior previously attributed to stretch elasticity is really a feature

of the corrected entropic elasticity; the true stretch compliance of single-stranded

DNA is several times smaller than that found by previous authors. Next we elab-

orate our model to allow coexistence of two conformational states of DNA, each

with its own stretch and bend elastic constants. Our model is computationally

simple, and gives an excellent ﬁt through the entire overstretching transition of

nicked, double-stranded DNA. The ﬁt gives the ﬁrst values for the elastic constants

of the stretched state. In particular we ﬁnd the eﬀective bend stiﬀness for DNA in

this state to be about 10 nm

kBT , a value quite diﬀerent from either B-form or

single-stranded DNA.

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

New single-molecule manipulation techniques have opened the mechanical properties of

individual macromolecules to much more direct study than ever before. For example, optical-

trap measurements give the force-extension relation of a single molecule of lambda DNA,

from which we can deduce the molecule’s average elastic properties by ﬁtting to a model.

Part of the beauty of this procedure is that we pass from an optical-scale measurement (the

total end-to-end length of the DNA is typically over 10 µm) to a microscopic conclusion (the

elastic constants of the 2 nm diameter DNA molecule). But by the same token, we must

be careful with the interpretation of our results. Fitting a physically inappropriate model

to data can give reasonable-looking ﬁts, but yield values of the ﬁt parameters that are not

microscopically meaningful.

We will illustrate the above remarks by studying high-force measurements of the force-

extension relation for single-stranded DNA. Previous authors have ﬁt this relation at low

to moderate forces to the Extensible Freely Jointed Chain (EFJC) model, obtaining as ﬁt

parameters a link length and an extension modulus for increasing the contour length of the

chain. We argue that to capture the microscopic physics, at least one additional element

must be added to the model, namely a link stiﬀness. The resulting model ﬁts the data better

than either the EFJC or the Extensible Worm-Like Chain (EWLC) models. The ﬁt also

yields a much large value of the extension modulus than previously reported. The reason

for this discrepancy is that high-force eﬀects previously attributed to intrinsic stretching of

the chain are, in our model, simply a part of the correct entropic elasticity.

The mathematical formalism we introduce to solve our model is of some independent

interest, being simpler than some earlier approaches. In particular, it is quite easy to extend

our model to study a linear chain consisting of two diﬀerent, coexisting conformations of the

polymer, each with its own elastic constants. We formulate and solve this model as well.

The model makes no assumptions about the elastic properties of the two states, but rather

deduces them by ﬁtting to recent data on the overstretching transition in nicked, double-

stranded DNA. Besides giving a very good ﬁt to the data, our model yields insight into the

character of the stretched conformation of DNA. The model is ﬂexible and can readily be

adapted to the study of the stretching of polypeptides with a helix-coil transition.

II. THE WORM-LIKE CHAIN AND THE FREELY JOINTED CHAIN

A. The Freely Jointed Chain

A polymer is a long, linear, single molecule. The chemical bonds deﬁning the molecule

can be more or less ﬂexible in diﬀerent cases. The simplest model of polymer conformation

treats the molecule as a chain of rigid subunits, joined by perfectly ﬂexible hinges—a “freely

jointed chain,” or FJC (Flory, 1969). The FJC model is not very appropriate to double-

stranded DNA, consisting of a stack of ﬂat basepairs joined by both covalent bonds and

physical interactions (hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic base-stacking energy), but for

single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) it forms an attractive starting point.

Deviations from the FJC picture can come from a variety of interactions among the

individual monomers: Individual covalent bonds may have bending energies that are not

small relative to kBT , successive monomers may have steric interactions, and so on. To

some extent we can compensate for the model’s omission of such interactions by choosing

an eﬀective link length b that is longer than the actual monomer size. Since the FJC views

the polymer as a chain of perfectly stiﬀ links, choosing a larger b gives us a chain of longer

links and thus eﬀectively stiﬀens the chain. Accordingly, one views b as a ﬁt parameter when

deriving the force-extension relation of the model. The ﬁt value of b can then depend both

on the molecule under study, and on its external conditions like salt concentration, as those

conditions aﬀect the intramolecular interactions.

To formulate the FJC we describe a molecular conformation by associating with each
segment a unit orientation vector ˆti, pointing in the direction of the ith segment, as sketched
in Fig. 1. In the presence of an external force ~f along the ˆz direction, we can deﬁne an energy

functional for the chain

In the absence of an external force, all conﬁgurations have equal energy and (neglecting

self-avoidance) the chain displays the characteristics of a random walk. To pull the ends of

such a chain away from each other a force has to be applied, as extending the chain reduces

its conformational entropy. The resulting entropic elastic behavior can be summarized in

B. The Wormlike Chain

As mentioned above, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is far from being a freely jointed

chain. Thus it is unsurprising that while the FJC model can reproduce the observed linear

force-extension relation of dsDNA at low stretching force, and the observed saturation at

high force, still it fails at intermediate values of f . Another indication that the model is

physically inappropriate is that the best-ﬁt value of the link length is b

100 nm, completely

≈

diﬀerent from the physical contour length per basepair of 0.34 nm.

To improve upon the FJC, we must account for the fact that the monomers do resist

bending.

In fact, the very great stiﬀness of double-stranded DNA can be turned to our

advantage, as it implies that successive monomers are constrained to point in nearly the

same direction. Thus we can treat the polymer as a continuum elastic body, its conﬁguration

described by the position ~r(s) as a function of the relaxed-state contour length s (see Fig. 2).

Continuing to treat the chain as inextensible gives the Worm Like Chain (Kratky and Porod,
1949; Saito et al., 1967). The local tangent and curvature vectors (~t and ~w, respectively)

are given by

~t(s) =

d~r(s)

~w(s) =

d~t(s)
ds

.

(4)

We temporarily assume that the chain is inextensible, expressed locally by the condition

that

~t(s)
|

|

= 1 everywhere.

To get an energy functional generalizing Eq. 1, we note that for a thin, homogeneous

rod the energy density of elastic strain is proportional to the square of the local curvature.

Adding the external-force term from Eq. 1 yields

Eq. 5 makes it clear that the parameter A is a measure of the bend stiﬀness of the chain.

A is also the persistence length of the chain, the characteristic length scale associated with

The force-extension relation for the WLC was obtained numerically in (Marko and Siggia,

1995); subsequently a high-precision interpolation formula was given in (Bouchiat et al.,

1999). At low force, the WLC also behaves like an ideal spring, with eﬀective spring constant

(Yamakawa, 1971)

κWLC =

.

Thus a WLC with stiﬀness parameter A yields a force-extension relation that at low force

matches the FJC with b = 2A.

The remarks at the start of this subsection make it clear that the WLC is just an ap-

proximation, valid in the limit where the persistence length A is much longer than the

physical monomer length (and width). When these conditions are not met, the picture of

the molecule as a thin, continuous, elastic body will not be accurate; short-length cutoﬀ

eﬀects will then enter in an essential way.

C. Experiments

Early single-molecule stretching experiments showed that double-stranded DNA closely

follows the predicted force-extension of the WLC at forces under 10 pN (Bustamante et al.,

1994). Later experiments probing the region 10 pN < f < 60 pN found a linear deviation

from the WLC prediction, attributable to a Hooke-law stretching elasticity (Cluzel et al.,

5

1996; Smith et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997). Adding this eﬀect into the model introduces

a second ﬁt parameter E in addition to A. To lowest order in f /E this modiﬁcation just

amounts to multiplying the model’s

z
Ltot i

h

by the factor (1 + f

E ); for dsDNA the resulting ﬁt

is very good out to 60 pN.

The situation for single-stranded DNA has been less clear. Adding an extensibility factor

to Eq. 2 again yields a model with two parameters (b and E). Though this “extensible

FJC” (EFJC) model yielded impressive ﬁts to the early experimental data, recent advances

in single-molecule manipulation (Clausen-Schaumann et al., 2000; Rief et al., 1999) have

again probed higher forces, and here the agreement is not so good. As shown in Fig. 5, the

previously cited values for b and E do not give a successful extrapolation to the regime of

higher forces. In the following section, we will propose a new model that borrows features

from both the FJC and the WLC to describe these data more accurately.

III. THE DISCRETE PERSISTENT CHAIN

The previous sections have made it clear that a real polymer will display both discreteness

and bend stiﬀness. While we have seen that the corresponding eﬀects on the force-extension

relation are interchangeable at very low forces, higher forces will distinguish them. Accord-

ingly we now formulate a model with both b and A; later we will add a stretch stiﬀness as

Our “Discrete Persistent Chain” (or DPC) models the polymer as a chain composed of N

segments of length b, whose conformation is once again fully described by the collection of

We will approximate λmax using a variational scheme. Following the line of argument

of (Marko and Siggia, 1995), we note that the leading eigenfunction of T will reﬂect the

physics of the problem in the sense that it must be azimuthally symmetric and peaked in

the direction of the applied force. A suitable 1-parameter family of trial eigenfunctions ~vω

can therefore be deﬁned by

For practical purposes this is the region where the magnitude of the bend stiﬀness A is

larger than, or at most comparable to, the link length b, which is the physically relevant

regime. We maximize Eq. 20 numerically to obtain λ∗max, from which we can then compute

the force-extension relation by numerical diﬀerentiation with respect to the force. In the
small force limit, we can do a little better based on the observation that for small ˜f , ω∗
is also small. Expanding Eq. 20 to second order in ω and ˜f we can analytically solve the
stationarity condition dy

dω = 0 (which is now simply a quadratic equation) and determine the

It is sometimes convenient to reexpress the parameters A and b of the DPC model in terms

It is straightforward to add an intrinsic stretch modulus to the calculation outlined above,

obtaining the “Extensible DPC” (or EDPC) model. We have computed the resulting force-

extension curves, and ﬁtted to recent data for ssDNA. The results of these ﬁts are collected

in Fig. 6. Fitting to the data points with f < 400 pN yields a value of the stretch modulus

of around E

4500 pN, more than four times larger than even the largest of the previous

≈

estimates (Clausen-Schaumann et al., 2000; Hegner et al., 1999; Rief et al., 1999). We

interpret this discrepancy by noting that if we hold κ constant while varying b, the diﬀerence

between the EFJC and EDPC models shows up in the high-force regime, which is also

sensitive to the choice of E. Thus neglecting cutoﬀ eﬀects causes curve ﬁtting to make a

compensating change in E.

The best ﬁt (in terms of χ2) is obtained for a value of b

0.17 nm, away from both

the EWLC (b = 0) and EFJC (b = 3kBT

κ = 1.7 nm) limits of the model. Even though to
the eye the diﬀerence between the three models in the ﬁt region might appear marginal,

≈

the improvement in χ2 achieved by the DPC at just over 18% is statistically relevant.

Interestingly, the ﬁt value of b is indeed comparable to the physical segment length of ssDNA

(0.6 nm), a result not put in by hand. Fig. 6 also shows that our EDPC model extrapolates

better to the high-force regime than either the EFJC or the EWLC.

Previous authors have already noted that the extensible FJC model does not accurately

model the high-force data (Clausen-Schaumann et al., 2000; Rief et al., 1999), but have

attributed its failure to the onset of nonlinear elasticity eﬀects. We may expect such eﬀects

1 Eq. 23 has the expected property that κDPC

0 with A ﬁxed. The opposite
limit, where A goes to 0 holding b ﬁxed, should recover the FJC, but instead Eq. 23 gives an unphysical,
negative value of κDPC. However, this limit takes us outside the domain of validity Eq. 21, and we cannot
use Eq. 23 any more. We have veriﬁed numerically that the DPC model does reduce to the FJC in that
particular limit.

to become signiﬁcant when the ratio f /E exceeds, say, 10%. Our large ﬁt value of E means

that we ought to be able to trust our linear-elasticity model out to around f = 400 pN,

which is why we used only the data up to this point in our ﬁt. Indeed Fig. 6 shows that

the extensible DPC model works well out to f = 400 pN. Carrying the ﬁt out to still larger

values of f would raise the ﬁt value of E still further.

IV. THE OVERSTRETCHING TRANSITION

A. Background

As ﬁrst observed by Cluzel et el. (Cluzel et al., 1996) and Smith et al (Smith et al.,

1996), stretching double stranded DNA is quite diﬀerent from single-strand DNA. Their

experiments showed that at a force of around 65–70 pN the DNA sample suddenly snaps

open (an “overstretching transition”), extending to almost twice its original contour length

before entering a second entropic stretching regime. This second regime clearly represents a

“stretched” DNA conﬁguration quite diﬀerent from ordinary double stranded or B-DNA, and

has been dubbed S-DNA. The transition from B-DNA into S-DNA is very sharp, indicating

a high level of cooperativity.

S-DNA appears to have a deﬁnite helical pitch (L´eger, 1999; L´eger et al., 1999), consis-

tent with its being a new, double-stranded conformation. An alternative view interprets

the overstretching transition as force-induced melting (denaturation) of the B-DNA duplex

(Rouzina and Bloomﬁeld, 2001a,b). One implication of the latter view is that S-DNA should

have elastic properties similar to those of two single strands, a point to which we will return

later.

Whatever view we take of its structural character, the sharpness of the overstretching

transition is reminiscent of another well-studied structural transition in biopolymers, the

helix-coil transition (Zimm and Bragg, 1959). Inspired by the classic analysis of Zimm and

Bragg, this section will model the B

S transition by a two-state (Ising) model living on a

→

DPC (the “Ising–DPC model”). We will make no assumptions about the nature of either

B- or S-DNA. Both are allowed to have arbitrary bend and stretch stiﬀnesses. Our aim is to

ﬁt the resulting force-extension curves to the available data and to see whether the values

of the elastic constants can help characterize the stretched state. (The other state is just

10

double stranded DNA, whose elastic constants are well known.)

B. General Setup

Fig. 7 illustrates the model that we will be considering in some more detail. We envision

a chain consisting of N links, connected by hinges that try to align the segments they join.

Each segment carries a discrete variable σ, which takes the values

1. We will take σ = +1

to mean the segment is in the B-state and σ =

1 for the S-state. The factor by which a

segment elongates when going from B to S will be called ζ, i.e. bS = ζb (with ζ > 1). We

−

assign a bend stiﬀness parameter A to B-DNA, and a diﬀerent AS

βζA to S-DNA; β is

±

≡

a dimensionless parameter with βζ < 1. We also need to assign a bend stiﬀness to a hinge

joining a B and an S segment. This value we will call ηA.

We can now write down the full energy functional for our Ising-DPC model:

Once again we approximate the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix T using a vari-

We could now proceed to evaluate the force-extension relation of the Ising-DPC model, by

generalizing Sect. III. To simplify the calculations, however, we will ﬁrst pass to a continuum

limit. To justify this step, note that Fig. 6 shows that the continuum (WLC) approximation

gives an excellent account of single-stranded DNA stretching out to forces beyond those

probed in overstretching experiments (about 90 pN). As mentioned earlier, the continuum

approximation is also quite good for double-stranded DNA, because the latter’s persistence

length is so much longer than its monomer size.

In the continuum limit b is sent to zero holding Ltot ﬁxed; hence N

two states respectively (Eq. 29). This procedure yields theoretical force-extension curves

like the ones plotted in Figs. (8) and (9).

In summary, our model contains the following seven parameters. 2 ¯αkBT is the free

are measured in pN. Finally, ζ is the dimensionless elongation factor associated with the

B

S transition.

→

D. Discussion of ﬁts

Our strategy is now as follows: ﬁrst, we ﬁt the part of the stretching curve well below

65 pN to a one-state, continuum model (i.e. to the EWLC), determining its eﬀective spring

constant and stretch modulus. The values thus obtained are used as initial guesses in a ﬁt

of the full curve to the Ising-DPC model. To improve convergence, we eliminate two of the

parameters, as follows. First, we can get an accurate value for EB from the low force data,

so we hold it ﬁxed to this value during the full ﬁt. Second, as described in Sect. III we can

work out the low-force limit analytically, and from this obtain the eﬀective spring constant

κ as a function of the model’s parameters. We invert this relation to get A as a function of

κ and the other parameters. We substitute this A, holding κ ﬁxed to the value obtained by

ﬁtting the low-force data to an EWLC. We then ﬁt the remaining ﬁve parameters (β,

, ¯α,

Q

ES and ζ) to the dataset2.

2 In our ﬁts, we exclude the data points in the steepest region of the graph. Because of the inevitable
scatter in the data and the fact that only the deviations in the y-direction enter into χ2 their residuals

15

The results of the ﬁts obtained in this manner are collected in Figs. (8) and (9). Our Ising-

DPC hybrid model ﬁts the experimental data rather well, but with so many ﬁt parameters

one may ask whether the model actually makes any falsiﬁable predictions. To answer this

question we note that the data below the transition suﬃce to ﬁx A and EB as usual, roughly

speaking from the curvature and slope of the curve below the transition. Similarly, the data

above the transition ﬁx AS = ζβA and ES. The vertical jump in the curve at the transition

ﬁxes ζ. The horizontal location of the jump ﬁxes ¯α, and the steepness of the jump ﬁxes the

cooperativity

.3 Thus all of the model’s parameters are ﬁxed by speciﬁc features of the

Q

data. Two additional, independent features of the data now remain, namely the rounding

of the curve at the start and end of the transition. Our model predicts these features fairly

succesfully.

Some common features emerging from the two ﬁts deserve comment. First, both ﬁts

reproduce the known values for the eﬀective persistence length of B-DNA of around 50 nm

and its stretch modulus of about 1000 pN. Second, we can read oﬀ the bend stiﬀness of

S-DNA from our ﬁt as AS = βζA = 12.32 nm (data from Fig. 8) or 7.2 nm (data from

Fig. 9). If S-DNA consisted of two unbound, single strands, we might have expected AS to

be twice as large as the value Ass

0.85 nm obtained by ﬁtting the single-strand stretching

≈

data with the continuum EDPC model (see Fig. 6). On the contrary, we ﬁnd that the bend

stiﬀness of S-DNA is intermediate between that of B-DNA and that of two single strands.

This conclusion ﬁts qualitatively with some of the structural models of S-DNA, in which the

bases remain paired but are not stacked as in B-DNA.

Our third conclusion is that the stretch modulus of S-DNA is substantially higher than

that of B-DNA. This conclusion is again consistent with the view of S-DNA as stabilized

mainly by its backbones, which are much straighter than in B-DNA; the contour length of

B-DNA is instead determined by weaker, base-stacking interactions.

E. Relation to prior work

Polymer models with both ﬁnite cutoﬀ and steric hindrances to motion are not new.

Classical examples include the rotation-isomer models, in which succeeding monomers are

joined by bonds of ﬁxed polar angle but variable azimuthal angle (Grosberg and Khlokhlov,

1994). Models of this sort have had some success in making a priori predictions of the persis-

tence length of a polymer from its structural information, but obtaining the force-extension

relation is mathematically very diﬃcult. Thus for example (Miyake and Sakakibara, 1962)

obtain only the ﬁrst subleading term in the low-force expansion. We are not aware of a prior

formulation of a model incorporating the microscopic physics of discreteness and stiﬀness,

with a detailed experimental test.

Several authors have also studied the entropic elasticity of two-state chains. As soon as

the overstretching transition was discovered, Cluzel proposed a pure Ising model by analogy

to the helix-coil transition (Cluzel, 1996). Others then introduced entropic elasticity, but

required that both states have the same bending stiﬀness as B-DNA (Ahsan et al., 1998;

Marko, 1998) or took one of the two states to be inﬁnitely stiﬀ (Tamashiro and Pincus,

2001), or to be a FJC (Rouzina and Bloomﬁeld, 2001a,b). We believe our Ising-DPC model

to be the ﬁrst consistent formulation incorporating the coexistence of two diﬀerent states

with arbitrary elastic constants. Our approach also is calculationally more straightforward

than some, and minimal in the sense that no unknown potential function needs to be chosen.

V. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE B

S TRANSITION

Using standard techniques from statistical physics, we now look at the B

S transition

in some more detail. From the expressions for the Ising-DPC hybrid energy functional (25)

and the partition function (26) we read oﬀ that the average “spin” σ can be obtained as

so that for instance the relative population of the S-state (or equivalently the probability to

ﬁnd an arbitrary segment in the S-state), P (S), is given by

in the S-state, P (S), as a function of the applied force, and we can see the characteristic

sigmoidal behavior as the system is led through the transition. As the inset demonstrates,

a small fraction is in the S-state even at zero force. This fraction initially decreases upon

increasing the stretching force.4 Fig. 11 plots the typical S-domain length Ldom versus

applied stretching force. It demonstrates how even well above the transition the S-state on

average does not persist for very long; at the high end of the physically accessible range of

forces S-domains measure about 160nm. This ﬁgure has some signiﬁcance as it illustrates

an important point about the role of nicks in the experiments. Empirically, when working

with λ-phage DNA only around 5% of all samples are completely unnicked (L´eger, 1999).

Since the λ-phage genome is about 48Kbp in length, we can roughly estimate the probability

for an arbitrary base pair to be unnicked is P (not) = (0.05)1/48000, and consequently the

probability that a given pair is nicked is P (nick) = 1

nicks per sample, corresponding to an average distance between nicks of the order of 5 µm,

considerably larger than the typical S-domain size. This observation bears on the question

of the character of the S state of DNA (Rouzina and Bloomﬁeld, 2001a): even if S-DNA were

a denatured state, the existence of nicks would not necessarily cause it to suﬀer irreversible

changes in its elasticity as tracts spanning two nicks fall oﬀ during overstretching.

4 A related reentrant phenomenon was noted in (Tamashiro and Pincus, 2001).

18

Secondly, diﬀerent groups have not agreed on whether the stretching curves of double-

stranded and single-stranded DNA coincide at forces above the former’s overstretching tran-

sition (Bustamante et al., 2000; L´eger, 1999). We wish to point out that even if S-DNA were

a denatured state, we still would not necessarily expect these two curves to coincide. Fig. 10

shows that the conversion from B- to S-form continues well beyond the apparent end of the

force plateau, continuing to aﬀect the force-extension curve. To determine whether S-DNA

is elastically similar to B-DNA one must disentangle the two states’ contributions to the

stretching curve by globally ﬁtting to a 2-state model, as we have done.

VI. CONCLUSION

Sect. I summarizes our conclusions. Here we list a number of interesting modiﬁcations

to the model, as possible extensions to this work.

While the variational approximation used here has proved to be adequate, still it is

straightforward to replace it by the eigenfunction-expansion technique, which can be carried

to arbitrary accuracy (Marko and Siggia, 1995). Similarly, the methods of Sect. III can

be used to work in the full, discrete DPC model instead of the continuum approximation

used in Sect. IV.C. It is also straightforward to retain ﬁnite-length eﬀects, by keeping the

subleading eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.

Real DNA is not a homogeneous rod. The methods of quenched disorder can be used

to introduce sequence-dependent contributions to the transition free energy α and the bend

stiﬀness A. Finally, we believe that the methods of this paper can be adapted to the study

of the stretching of individual polypeptide and polysaccharide molecules (Rief et al., 1998).

from (Rief et al., 1999) to the extensible FJC model. Included in the ﬁt are the data up to a force

of 100 pN. Fitting only those data points yields a link length b = 1.75 nm and a stretch modulus

E = 8

102 pN, reproducing the typical values as cited for instance in (Clausen-Schaumann et al.,

2000; Hegner et al., 1999; Rief et al., 1999). In this graph, we have extrapolated this ﬁt to the

high-force range, to demonstrate that the parameters as extracted from the low-force data do not

represent the full range of data faithfully.

In addition, the dashed and

ﬁts include the data points only for forces between 20 pN and 400 pN. Values for χ2 were EFJC :

χ2 = 1.269; EWLC : χ2 = 0.600 and EDPC : χ2 = 0.490 at N = 1523. We ignore the lowest-force

points because of complications induced by hairpins and other secondary structures in the DNA.

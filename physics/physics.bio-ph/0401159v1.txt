Abstract

Vesicles under a shear ﬂow exhibit a tank-treading motion of their membrane,
while their long axis points with an angle < π
4 with respect to the shear stress if the
viscosity contrast between the interior and the exterior is not large enough. Above a
certain viscosity contrast, the vesicle undergoes a tumbling bifurcation, a bifurcation
which is known for red blood cells. We have recently presented the full numerical
analysis of this transition. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model that has
the advantage of being both simple enough and capturing the essential features found
numerically. The model is based on general considerations and does not resort to the
explicit computation of the full hydrodynamic ﬁeld inside and outside the vesicle.

Introduction

Vesicles are closed membranes, which are suspended in an aqueous solution. They rep-
resent an attractive biomimetic system, which has revealed several interesting static and
dynamical features that bear a strong resemblance with some behavior of real cells. Among
these features we can cite equilibrium shapes [1] revealing forms similar to red blood cells,
and tumbling known for these cells [2]. It is known that red cells, like vesicles [3], orient
themselves at a given angle with respect to the shear ﬂow at high hematocrit (high enough
concentration of red cells), while at low hematocrit (where cells behave as being individ-
ual) both in vitro and in vivo observations reveal a tumbling motion, where the long axis
of the red cell rotates in a periodic fashion. It has been recognized for a long time that the
viscosity ratio between the internal ﬂuid and the ambient one is a decisive factor (the more
viscous is the internal ﬂuid in comparison to the external one, the easiest is the tumbling).
Another relevant ingredient is the swelling ratio: a ﬂatten out cell would tumble more
easily than a swollen one. Several attempts in understanding the tumbling transition have
been made in the litterature, the most prominent one is the work of Keller and Skalak
[4]. This work uses the solution of the hydrodynamical equations in the Stokes regime
(inertial eﬀects are negligibly small for biological blood transport) around an ellipsoid
which involve quite complex expressions. But still several assumptions had to be made in
order to solve the problem. Recently, a full numerical analysis has been presented [5] and
provided the boundaries in the parameter space (basically the viscosity contrast, and the
swelling ratio) separating the regions of tumbling and those of tank-treading. That work

focused on vesicles that correspond to a simpliﬁed model of red blood cells, and especially
ignored the elastic properties of the membrane, a fact which though turns out to lead to
some interesting qualitative changes, will not be accounted for here either.

Due to the interplay of several eﬀects in the tumbling transition, it is highly desirable
to have at our disposal an analytical theory, which, on the one hand, should reproduce
the basic essential features of the tumbling transition, and on the other, should be simple
enough in order to shed light on the various competing phenomena leading to tumbling.
It is the main aim of the present paper to deal with this question.

The present theory bypasses the tedious computation of the velocity ﬁeld around the
ellipsoid (Note that in the general case, no analytical solution of the Stokes ﬂow is known),
and is based on the assumption that the forces acting on each piece of the vesicle membrane
are proportional to the actual relative velocity at the membrane with respect to the applied
ﬂow. It follows from our study that simple enough notions account remarkably well for
many features and render each eﬀect transparent. In addition, this work oﬀers a promising
basis for more elaborate models, including, for example, the eﬀect of membrane stretching
or shear elasticity.

The scheme of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we present the basic ingredients of
the model. Section 3 is devoted to the derivation of the dynamical equation that governs
the motion of the vesicle. This part is based on a torque balance. Section 4 presents
a complementary ingredient that serves to put the evolution equation in a closed form.
This is based on an energy balance between the inner ﬂuid of the vesicle and the work
provided by the ambient one. The main outcomes of the analytical theory together with
their confrontation with the full numerical analysis are presented in section 6.

2 Basic ingredients of the model

• As in [4], we will assume the shape of the vesicle to be an undeformable ellipse, with
the long and the short axes denoted by a and b, respectively. It will be recognized
that the theory can be used for arbitrary prescribed shapes. For deﬁnitness11 we
shall, however, specialize our discussion to an elliptical shape. The enclosed area is
denoted by S, and the perimeter by P . The ﬂuid embedded into the vesicle has a
viscosity µin and the ambient one µout. τ is the swelling ratio of the vesicle deﬁned
in 2D as τ = 4πS/P 2. For a circle τ = 1 and it is smaller than one otherwise.

• The vesicle is subjected to a linear shear ﬂow (vx = γy, vy = 0) where γ is the shear
rate. Since the vesicles of interest have a ﬂuid membrane, each material point on
the membrane will be transported by the ﬂow, so that the membrane moves in a
tank-tread fashion.

Let us make a remark, which will prove to be useful later in this paper. A simple
shear ﬂow characterized by the (2×2) shear rate matrix

As shown on Fig. 2, the antisymmetric part provides a rigid-like clockwise rotation of
the vesicle (R), while the symmetric part corresponds to an elongational (or strain)
ﬂow, which tends to orient the vesicle along π

4 (E).

Our calculation is based on the following two properties of the Stokes equations:

• Due to the linearity of the Stokes equations, the superposition principle for given
boundary conditions applies: the velocity ﬁeld around a vesicle subjected to a tank-
treading and a tumbling motion in a simple shear ﬂow is the sum of the velocity
ﬁelds obtained for the three following conﬁgurations (see Fig. 3):

– A simple shear ﬂow acting on a rigid body ﬁxed in the ﬂow at a constant
orientation angle ψ with a ﬂuid velocity equal to zero on the contour of the
vesicle.

quiescent ﬂuid.

– The ﬂow created by an elliptic body subjected to a tank-treading motion of its

contour and ﬁxed at a constant orientation ψ in a quiescent ﬂuid.

• The second ingredient, which follows from the previous one, is an extension of a
general result valid in Stokes ﬂows for a solid which is in relative motion at a ve-
locity V with respect to the surrounding ﬂuid. The drag force on the solid scales
as Fdrag = µ λ V , where λ is (a drag coeﬃcient) function of the geometry of the
body. 1 There is a linear relation between the force and the relative velocity of
the body with respect to the applied ﬂow. We view the elliptic contour as being
represented by adjacent segments. The key hypothesis of the following analysis is to
apply this property, ie. the linearity between forces and relative velocities, on each
segment of the membrane. Let us make some important comments about the mean-
ing of this assumption. The external force applied on an elementary segment of the
membrane is provided, on the one hand, by the ﬂow imposed externally, and, on the
other hand, by the back-ﬂow due to the presence of the vesicle. This retroaction of
the vesicle on the applied ﬂow is a complex piece of the study and an exact determi-
nation of its eﬀect requires sophisticated numerical treatments such as the Boundary
Integral method ([6, 7]). In our model, the basic assumption stated above takes into
account this complex interaction in an eﬀective manner: the eﬀect of the back-ﬂow
is included in the coeﬃcient λ, which links the eﬀective force to the relative velocity
of the segment with respect to the applied ﬂow. In the framework of our model,
1More precisely, the Stokes force exerted on a solid of typical length L in a translational motion at

speed U, in a quiescent newtonian ﬂuid of viscosity µ, scales indeed as

More formally, we can write a linear relation between the force and the velocity:

can write :

this coeﬃcient is chosen to be independant on the particular elementary segment
considered. This is reminiscent of a ”mean-ﬁeld” like approximation. This coeﬃ-
cient is also a priori non isotropic, i.e. takes diﬀerent values depending on wether we
consider the normal direction or the transverse direction of the elementary segment
considered. These two values will be denoted as λt and λn and their determination
will be discussed in section 6. To some extent this model is akin to the Rouse model
for polymer rods [8], where hydrodynamical interactions between adjacent pieces are
ignored.

3 Mechanical equilibrium for the vesicle in the shear ﬂow

As stated above, the main idea is to use the linear generalized Stokes law at the local
level of each segment of the contour, and to compute the torque associated with the force.
Since we shall decompose the velocity ﬁeld into an applied shear, a tank-treading motion,
and a tumbling one, we shall have to deal with three types of forces separately. Once each
torque is evaluated, we sum up the three contributions, and set the resultant to be zero,
owing to absence of inertia. Once the expressions of the forces are speciﬁed, the remaining
pieces of the work are purely algebraic with some speciﬁc integrals involving the geometry
of the vesicle.

Since the Stokes law relating the force to the relative velocity is local, we ﬁnd it
convenient to ﬁrst, write it in the frame linked to the vesicle, and then, to express the
torque elements in the laboratory frame for ease of computations. We refer to Fig. 1 for
the diﬀerent frames used here. The laboratory frame has the basis denoted as (ex, ey).
The rotating frame, which is linked to the principal axes of the ellipse, is speciﬁed by
its basis denoted (e′
y). The local frame associated to an elementary segment on the
elliptic contour is speciﬁed by (et, en).

x, e′

In the local frame (et, en), the components of the local force (or drag) applied on the
segment per unit length in the transverse direction can be expressed as functions of the
relative velocities (Vt, Vn) exerted upon a membrane element:

dFt = −µoutλtVtdl
dFn = −µoutλnVndl

(3)

where λt and λn are phenomenological parameters of the model associated respectively to
the transverse and the normal motions to the segment dl. λt and λn have positive values
with the choice of Eqs. 3. They have a dimension of the inverse of a length. The crux of
the analysis is to decompose the local velocity in three pieces as stated above, and evaluate
various torques.

• (1): Torque of the force acting on the body in a simple shear ﬂow

In the laboratory frame (ex, ey), the velocity ﬁeld of a simple shear ﬂow takes the
form:

γ is the shear rate, which ﬁxes the time-scale of the ﬂow. Written in the local
coordinate system (et, en), the relative velocity reads:

vx = γ y
vy = 0

Vsheart = −γ yex.et
Vshearn = −γ yex.en

Using (3), we determine the associated forces denoted as dFsheart and dFshearn, from
which the torque is computed as:

Because the inertial eﬀects are small (and thus neglected), the sum of the three torques
must vanish. Summing up the three contributions (Eqs. (5), (9) and (12)), one ﬁnds the
evolution equation for the angular velocity of the vesicle:

where we have deﬁned the three quantities on the r.h.s. of (13) as

Reporting into (14)-(15), and requiring in (13) that dΨ/dt = 0 (since for a sphere the
contribution to tumbling vanishes 2), we obtain:

2Distinguishing between tumbling and tank-treading for a sphere might seem a bit confusing. The case
of a sphere is degenerate, since one can view the dynamics as being of pure tank-treading or pure tumbling
nature. Indeed requiring either that dΨ
dt = 0, as we did here, or Vtank = 0 , provides the same velocity
along the contour. For continuity reasons with the case where there is a slight deviation from a sphere, we
interpret the motion under question as being of tank-treading type.

Vtank =

(16)

(17)

This is the expected value of the tank-treading velocity in the case of a sphere with a
radius a. Interestingly, this result holds whatever the prescription for the parameters λn
and λt.

Inspection of eqs (13)-(16) reveals, in particular, that for a rigid membrane where
Vtank = 0, no stationnary solution is possible: a rigid elliptic body should always tumble,
as one expects. This can be interpreted by the fact that the rotational velocity | ωrot | is
always bigger than the elongational velocity | ωelong |. If allowance is made for a tank-
treading motion (due to the membrane ﬂuidity and the ﬁnite viscosity of the internal
liquid) then ωc 6= 0. Equations (13), (14) and (15) show indeed that the tank-treading
motion described by the velocity ωc results in an eﬀective reduction of the global rotation
ωrot, provided that the tank-treading velocity Vtank has a positive value. A stationary
(non tumbling) tank-treading motion of the shape is thus possible if the velocity | ωelong |,
representing the elongational part of the ﬂow, can balance the eﬀective tumbling velocity
| ωrot + ωc |. This can occur for suﬃciently high values of the tank-treading velocity.
Hitherto, the tank-treading velocity has been introduced as a phenomenological quantity,
and it must be computed independently. This step is necessary in order to have an
evolution equation in a closed form. The tank-treading velocity is clearly limited by the
viscous friction of the internal ﬂuid, and this piece of information must be evoked in order
to complete the analysis.

4 Determination of the tank-treading velocity

Following [4], the tank-treading velocity Vtank can be determined by considering the energy
dissipated in the system. The energy injected by the ﬂow is dissipated by viscous friction
in the ﬂuid inside the vesicle. The energy rate (or power) provided by the ﬂuid to an
elementary segment in the laboratory frame is equal to dF.Vt.

The velocity Vt at a point r of the membrane can be written in the same frame as:

Vt = Vtanket + w × r

(18)

where w = dψ
dt

ez is the instantaneous angular velocity of the vesicle.

An elementary force dF acting on an element dl of the membrane can be decomposed

according to the previous section as:

dF = dFshear + dFtumble + dFtank

The sum of the torques applied on the vesicle is equal to zero, entailing:

dF.(w × r)dl =

w.(r × dF)dl = 0

I
Hence, only the ﬁrst contribution of the velocity in (18) matters. The total power provided
by the ﬂow has the following contributions:

Etot = Eshear + Etumble + Etank

• The contribution from the simple shear ﬂow is Eshear =

s2 = 2λtπa3; P ′ = 2λtπa, and L1 = L2, Ls1 = Ls2. This implies that both

coeﬃcients α and β vanish, and so does the total power. This result is conforting since
inside a sphere the ﬂuid executes a rigid-like rotation (there is no dissipation) and thus no
energy can be transferred. It is only when the shape deviates from a circle (or a sphere in

information about dissipation in the enclosed ﬂuid, and this points to a consistency of the
model.

In general, we have to determine the velocity ﬁeld, which satiﬁes the Stokes equations
inside the vesicle and subjected to boundary conditions at the surface of the ellipse. Our
aim is not to determine the velocity ﬁeld exactly, which is not an easy task in general (and
an exact result is the exception rather than the rule). Rather we wish to capture the main
ingredients and remain within a heuristic analysis. For that purpose, it will be suﬃcient
to make use of an approximate solution inferred from simple considerations based on the
result relative to a spherical shape. In order to anticipate the main ingredient, we shall
take the case of a slightly deformed circle as a reference in order to serve as a guide for our
reasoning. Consider e = b−a
to be small. The following velocity ﬁeld fulﬁlls the prescribed
a
conditions (i.e. to be a solution of the Stokes equations in the inner domain of the vesicle):

It must be noted that despite the fact that the velocity is not exactly constant along
the contour, the velocity remains colinear to the tangent at the membrane 3 and this
continues to represent a reasonable approximation. Let us estimate the energy dissipated
in the vesicle. This is given by :

As could be anticipated, the tank-treading velocity is directly proportional to γ which
ﬁxes the time-scale of the imposed ﬂow. We also note that the tank-treading velocity
enjoys the same symmetry as the elongational ﬂow does: it vanishes for ψ = ± π
4 and is
maximal for ψ = 0.

Some remarks are in order. As explained in section 3, a shear ﬂow can always be
split into a rotational part and an elongational one (see Fig. 2). In order to understand
the origin of the tank-treading motion, it is appropriate to specify the role of both the
elongational and the rotational components of the ﬂow.

On the one hand, for a purely rotational ﬂow, eq. (24) shows that Etot = µoutαV 2
tank
since β = 0. Equating (24) and (28) leads to the condition Vtank = 0, provided that
the shape is not circular. This corresponds to a global solid-like rotation. On the other
hand, for a purely elongational ﬂow, eqs.
(24) and (28) lead to Vtank ∼ cos(2ψ). A
non-zero tank-treading velocity is possible with the proviso that the orientation angle is
diﬀerent from ψ = π
4 (cos(2ψ) 6= 0). The torque applied on the vesicle arising from the
elongational ﬂow is (see eq.7) Melong ∼ cos(2ψ). An inspection of the balance of the
torques for the elongational ﬂow, as done in section 3, leads to the dynamical equation
dψ
dt ∼ cos(2ψ). ψ = π
4 is thus, the only steady equilibrium position, with a tank-treading
velocity equal to zero. Hence, the existence of a tank-treading motion of the membrane is
only a consequence of the coupling between the rotational and the elongational part of the
ﬂow. The total eﬀect of the shear can be interpreted as follows: the rotational part tends
to push the orientation angle of the vesicle axis towards lower values than ψ = π
4 . As soon
as this is achieved the vesicle acquires a non-zero tank-treading velocity since there, the
elongational part enters into action (see eq.(16)) 4

5 Dynamical equation for the orientation angle

Plugging eq. (29) into eq. (13), we can express explicitly ωc (which involves the tank-
treading motion of the vesicle) and this leads to the general dynamical equation for the
orientation angle ψ of the vesicle:

4Note that the tank-treading velocity is the result of an energy balance which involves the coupling
between the rotational and the elongational parts of the ﬂow. Since energetic quantities are quadratic func-
tions of the velocity ﬁeld, the tank-treading velocity is not simply the sum of the tank-treading motions
associated respectively to the elongational component and the rotational component considered indepen-
dently. Such a summation would result in a vanishing tank-treading velocity

A purely tank-treading motion corresponds to the situation where the inclination angle

This is the general condition which can be tabulated numerically, provided that the two
drag coeﬃcients λt and λn are known, which is exactly the case for several shapes (disks,
ellipses, spheres). Thus, the condition relates uniquely the viscosity contrast to geometrical
quantities which are functions of the swelling ratio. In order to gain more insight towards
an analytical progress we can explore the situation of a small deformation around the
spherical shape. This proves to be suﬃcient to capture the essential features. For that
purpose, we set e = b − a and treat e as a small parameter. The integrals L1, L2... that
enter in (36) can be evaluated explicitly, so that the critical condition for tumbling is
expressed in a simple form in terms of the viscosity ratio and the swelling ratio τ :

and the dissipation rate (28) scales as:

This law for the dissipation rate is in a good agreement with previous numerical results
(see [5]). We ﬁnd here that the closer is the shape to a sphere, the more diﬃcult does
tumbling occur; the viscosity contrast for tumbling diverges as 1/(1 − τ ).

6 Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the model

We have seen that the model presented here captures the essential features and sheds
light on the various competing eﬀects that ﬁx the tank-treading and tumbling motions.
We may ask the question whether the model can be made more quantitative. As stated
before, the model requires the introduction of two drag parameters λt and λn which
are the proportionality constants relating the force and velocity in the normal and the
tangential directions. Let us recall that these two drag coeﬃcients describe the eﬀect of
the hydrodynamic interaction felt by a membrane element. This involves the geometry
of the shape around a given element of membrane and these drag parameters are a priori
function of the position of the element considered on the contour.
If one wishes to go
beyond a qualitative discussion we must determine these two drag parameters, which can
be made in general only numerically. For a sphere with a radius a moving in a Stokes
ﬂow, it is known that on a local segment of the spherical contour we have: λt = λn = 3/2a

13

(see [9]). Instead of evaluating the exact values of these parameters for each elementary
elements of the membrane, we shall rather estimate them from the best ﬁt with the full
numerical simulations obtained previously([5]). Note that each membrane portion can be
approximated locally as an arc of a circle. Thus, as in the case of a sphere we chose equal
values for the drag coeﬃcients in the normal and in the transverse directions with respect
to the contour: λt = λn. We consider now a vesicle with an aspect ratio τ = 0.8 and
determine several quantities.

The results have been confronted to the full numerical computation and the values of
λt and λn have been guessed. For various tests made so far, we found that λt = λn ≃ 4
per unit length in the transverse direction provide the most reasonable ﬁt. We present on
Fig. 4 the evolution of the equilibrium angle as a function of the viscosity ratio r, which
corresponds to the stable branch of the saddle-node bifurcation [10]. The prediction of the
model qualitatively reproduces the bifurcation branch (this is always the case regardless of
the chosen parameter), and is fairly in reasonable agreement on the quantitative level. The
point at which the angle is zero corresponds to the threshold of the tumbling bifurcation.
This threshold depends on the swelling ratio. Consequently, the two parameters controlling
the bifurcation are the viscosity contrast and the swelling ratio. Fig. 5 represents the
boundary between the region of the phase diagram where pure tank-treading motion takes
place (low r and high τ ) and that, where the motion is of tumbling type (which is favored
at large r and small τ ). The results are compared with the full numerical calculation. It
is also worthwhile to represent some other physical quantities. Of particular interest are
the global rotation velocity and the tank-treading velocity (Figs. 6,7 and 8,9).

Before concluding some additional comments are worth to mention. Following the
considerations in section 4, the tank-treading motion is a result of the competition be-
tween the rotational part of the ﬂow and the elongational component. More precisely,
the rotational component pushes the vesicle axis away from the elongational main axis
(ψ < π/4), allowing the membrane to acquire a non-zero tank-treading motion. One may
say that part of the rotation torque is transferred to the tank-treading one. Increasing the
viscosity of the inner ﬂuid results in a global reduction of the tank-treading velocity since
the internal dissipation penalizes velocity gradients inside the vesicle (see Fig. 9). From
Fig. 8 the eﬀective tumbling velocity should thus increase, reducing further the value of ψ.
However, thanks to the cos(2ψ) variation of the tank-treading velocity, a new equilibrium
position can be found at a value of ψ which is a decreasing function of the viscosity ratio.
In the extreme limit where ψeq = 0, the elongational velocity ωelong reaches its maximum
and can not overcome the rotational velocity on further increase of the internal viscosity:
the steady-state solution doesn’t exist anymore whereby a new dynamical solution takes
place in the form of tumbling. Fig. 4 illustrates the evolution of the equilibrium angle as
a function of the viscosity ratio.

The above discussion was made on the assumption that the swelling ratio is constant.
The swelling ratio is a measure of the deviation from a spherical shape. For the particular
case of a circular shape (corresponding to a swelling ratio τ = 1), the total velocity arising
from the rotational part of the ﬂow is completely transferred in the tank-treading motion
of the membrane so that the eﬀective tumbling velocity | ωrot + ωc |= 0 (in reality, as
commented above, this situation is degenerate and there is no distinction between rigid
rotation and tank-treading). For a circular shape, the tank-treading velocity is maximal
and equal to Vtank = γ
2 a where a is the radius of the circle. This result has already been

14

obtained directly in section 3.

Figures 6 and 7 represent the evolution of the tank-treading velocity and the eﬀective
tumbling velocity | ωrot + ωc | as a function of the swelling ratio τ . As the shape deviates
from a circular one, the eﬀective velocity responsible for tumbling | ωrot + ωc | increases
(Fig. 6) since the tank-treading velocity decreases (Fig. 7). This explains that the
transition to a tumbling regime can be achieved for lower values of the viscosity ratio as
the swelling ratio decreases. This is indeed what is observed on Fig. 5.

7 Conclusion

We have presented a simple model bypassing the calculation of the Stokes ﬂow. We have
captured the essential features of the transition tank-treading/tumbling, and have a trans-
parent view of the various competing phenomena. This work has added a piece to our
understanding of tumbling. There are several important eﬀects that have been disre-
garded, however. We have restricted most of our discussion to 2D shapes. In view of the
result of Keller and Skalak[4] we do not expect a qualitative change when 3D shapes are
considered, provided that the shape is prescribed. If the shape is free to evolve, the shear
may induce a shape transformation, like a prolate/oblate transition, and this constitutes
an important task for future investigations. In addition, we did not include the fact that
the two monolayers forming the vesicle membrane may slide with respect to each other
[11]. In that case one has to include two tank-treading velocities, one for each layer, and
evaluate the membrane internal dissipation. It will be an interesting point to clarify the
inﬂuence of this fact on tumbling. For biological cells, like red cells, further reﬁnement of
the model is clearly necessary. For example, red blood cells tumble in vivo in the same
manner as vesicles do. There is however a notable diﬀerence between vesicles and red cells.
The transition to tumbling depends on the shear rate [2]. This dependence is completely
absent for vesicles since there is only one time scale 1/γ which is imposed by the ﬂow.
This points to the fact that there should exist a relevant intrinsic time scale for red cells.
A natural candidate is the elastic (or even viscoelastic) response of the cytoskeleton. A
natural time scale is µ/G where G is the (2D) shear modulus of the spectrin network
forming the red cell cytoskeleton, and µ is the membrane viscosity. Available data on G
[12] and µ [13] provide us with µ/G of the order of 10−2 − 10−1 seconds, which is not far
from 1/γ in ordinary experiments [2]. We are presently using a simple model for elasticity
in order to analyse the qualitative features of this eﬀect [14].

This work has beneﬁtted from a ﬁnal support from CNES (Centre National d’Etudes
Spatiales).

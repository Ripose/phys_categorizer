We study the problem of information propagation in brain microtubules. After considering the prop-
agation of electromagnetic waves in a ﬂuid of permanent electric dipoles, the problem reduces to
the sine-Gordon wave equation in one space and one time dimensions. The problem of propagation
of information is thus set.

Information is a central question in the understand-
ing of the mechanisms regulating the brain. Questions
as bounds on information, capacity of communication
channels are of extreme relevance and a theory of in-
formation and communication is of utter value [1]. Thus,
how much information can be stored by a cube is an im-
portant question. Foreseeable technology making use of
atomic manipulation would suggest an upper bound of
around 1020 bits. But as technology takes advantage of
unforeseen paradigms, this number could grow up. Could
the bound grow without limit? With black hole ther-
modynamics some deﬁnite answers are forthcoming [2].
In Quantum Field Theory the question developed unex-
pectedly in the framework of black hole thermodynamics
and Quantum Gravity [3]. Some knowledge was already
known from Shannon’s Theory of Information as well [4].
Shannon imagined a system capable of storing infor-
mation by virtue of it possessing many distinguishable
states. A state a is not known a priori but its probabil-
ity pa is known. The measure of uncertainty corresponds
to an entropy S which formally coincides with the corre-
sponding statistical interpretation of entropy:

where ~Etr is the electric ﬁeld transversal to the wave
propagation direction and ~s is a spin ﬁeld describing the
electric dipole moment degree of freedom. The last term
represents an eﬀective interaction of the z-component of
the electric dipole with an average electric ﬁeld, that is,
it represents a two-energy eigenstates system. The value

Such a problem has been considered by [8]. We derive
some results which have not been explicitely obtained in
[8]. We suppose that the electromagnetic ﬁeld has a fast
dependence on z

On the other hand, it has been conjectured [5] that
the brain microtubules might be an active component of
the brain functioning. It is thus natural to consider elec-
tromagnetic waves moving in that cavity as transporting
and carrying information.

With these matters in mind, we consider here the ef-
fective electromagnetic wave obtained when the second
quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld interacts with the per-
manent dipole moment of the vicinal water in brain mi-
crotubules. The second quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld
shall be given by the usual development in frequency
components [6]. The electric dipoles can be seen as
two-component spinors described as eﬀective spin-ﬁelds.
Therefore, we have, for the eﬀective Hamiltonian,

This is a quantum equation of motion. However we do
not have any practical means to either measure the vari-
able s, or take care of its detailed dynamics, therefore
we take its quantum average. Such an average is easily
obtained due to the simple description of s in terms of
Pauli matrices, leading to a result written in terms of the
exponential of the ﬁeld θ, deﬁned by

where N/V is the number of dipoles (molecules) per unit

to the usual combinations of the transversal direction,
and we supposed also that the longitudinal direction does

Gordon equation. The one-soliton solution is given by

In order to understand the propagation of information
in such a device, we follow [1] and consider small pertur-

Let us discuss the physics behind the problem and the
consequences for the constants appearing in the solution.
First, the constant ǫ is a free parameter and represents
the energy of a dipole in the vicinal water. It is of the
order of magnitude of diﬀerence of two molecular energy
levels. The study of vibration in water indicates the value
10−14erg [7]. The

constant µ represents the permanent electric dipole mo-
ment of the water, which is the electron charge times
10−18. Fi-

nally, the number of molecules per unit volume is easily

obtained for the water, it is of the order of 0.3
In order to ﬁx the velocity of the wave, we integrate the
solitonic electric ﬁeld imposing that it is the unit synaptic
potential coming from the quantum of transmitter pro-
ducing a postsynaptic potential, typically 0.5 to 1.0mV,

thus obtaining, for the velocity parameter, the value ν0 ≈

ν0 we obtain for the constant A the result A

1011s−1. Estimating the time to send information as that

On the other hand, taking the average electric ﬁeld in
the brain as corresponding to the quantum unit of elec-
tric potential value as discussed above, namely
1mV,
divided by the lenght of the typical microtubule, that is,
10nm we are led, for the average electric ﬁeld, to the

1010s−1.

The corresponding wavelenght is λ = c

3mm.
This corresponds to the order of magnitude of the pineal
gland. Whether this is just a coincidence or whether it
has a deeper meaning is a question that deserves further
study. Moreover, it corresponds to a typical frequency
already obtained for phonon transitions in the brain, al-
lowing for new theoretical models of the interaction of
electromagnetism with the biological cells [10]!

Furthermore, there are bounds on information storage.
Theoretically, in a problem of completely diﬀerent char-
acter, one arrives at the maximum entropy a cache can
hold, with the result

Imax <

where R is the overall radius of the object under study
and

its energy.

In the theory of solitons, the number of possible
information-holding conﬁgurations based on the soliton
equals the number of quanta that might populate the
ﬁrst excited level. To this number we must add unity to
account for the soliton conﬁguration itself. So, the pos-
sible conﬁgurations within an energy budget

soliton energy is N (

while the bound (15) corresponds to Imax < 6.

It would not be too original to call such an information
a quantum information unit sent via the microtubuiles,
in view of similar considerations, in a diferent context by
Gabor [11]. In the present case, the soliton, formed by the
interaction of Quantum Electrodynamics with the elec-
tric dipole moment of the background water in the one-
dimensional device oﬀered by microtubules is the natural
way chosen by nature to send information bits.

Another interesting point is the fact that the frequency
parameters which showed up naturally in the course of
the computations have natural interpretations in terms

This is a further example of the application of Quan-
tum Field Theory to general aspects of matter interac-
tions in complex systems.
It is clear that this is not
a way of achieving comprehension of the complexity as-
pects of such a sophisticated system, but it certainly pro-
vides valuable tools for working in this ﬁeld as well.

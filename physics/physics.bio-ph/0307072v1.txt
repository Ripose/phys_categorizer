Entropy and information provide natural measures of correlation among elements in a network.
We construct here the information theoretic analog of connected correlation functions: irreducible
N –point correlation is measured by a decrease in entropy for the joint distribution of N variables
relative to the maximum entropy allowed by all the observed N − 1 variable distributions. We
calculate the “connected information” terms for several examples, and show that it also enables
the decomposition of the information that is carried by a population of elements about an outside
source.

Keywords: entropy, information, multi–information, redundancy, synergy, correlation, network

In statistical physics and ﬁeld theory, the nature of or-
der in a system is characterized by correlation functions.
These ideas are especially powerful because there is a
direct relation between the correlation functions and ex-
perimental observables such as scattering cross sections
and susceptibilities. As we move toward the analysis of
more complex systems, such as the interactions among
genes or neurons in a network, it is not obvious how to
construct correlation functions which capture the under-
lying order. On the other hand it is possible to observe
directly the activity of many single neurons in a network
or the expression levels of many genes, and hence real
experiments in these systems are more like Monte Carlo
simulations, sampling the distribution of network states.
Shannon proved that, given a probability distribution
over a set of variables, entropy is the unique measure
of what can be learned by observing these variables,
given certain simple and plausible criteria (continuity,
monotonicity and additivity) [1]. By the same argu-
ments, mutual information arises as the unique mea-
sure of the interdependence of two variables, or two sets
of variables. Deﬁning information theoretic analogs of
higher order correlations has proved to be more diﬃcult
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. When we compute N –point cor-
relation functions in statistical physics and ﬁeld theory,
we are careful to isolate the connected correlations, which
are the components of the N –point correlation that can-
not be factored into correlations among groups of fewer
than N observables. We propose here an analogous mea-
sure of “connected information” which generalizes pre-
cisely our intuition about connectedness and interactions
from ﬁeld theory; a closely related discussion for quan-
tum information has been given recently [11].

Consider N variables {xi}, i = 1, 2, ..., N , drawn from
the joint probability distribution P ({xi}); this has an
entropy [12].

S({xi}) = −

P ({xi}) log P ({xi}).

(1)

The fact that N variables are correlated means that the

X{xi}

entropy S({xi}) is smaller than the sum of the entropies
for each variable individually,

S({xi}) <

S(xi).

The total diﬀerence in entropy between the interacting
variables and the variables taken independently can be

formed by taking the product of the marginals,
This has been called the multi–information; it provides
a general measure of non–independence among multiple
variables in a network.

Q

The multi–information alone does not tell us how much
of the non–independence among N variables is intrinsic
to the full N variables and how much can be explained
from pairwise, triple, and higher order interactions. For
example, if the xi’s are binary variables or equivalently
Ising spins σi, and if the full distribution P ({σi}) is a
conventional Ising model with pairwise exchange interac-
tions, then in an obvious sense there is nothing “new” to
learn by observing triplets of spins that can’t be learned
by looking at all the pairs. On the other hand, if σ3
is formed as the exclusive OR (XOR) of the variables
σ1 and σ2, then the essential structure of P (σ1, σ2, σ3)
is contained in a three–spin interaction; if σ1 an σ2 are
chosen at random as inputs to the XOR, then all pairwise
mutual informations among the σi will be zero, although
the multi–information will be one bit (Fig. 1)

What we would like to do in our example of three vari-
ables is to separate that component of I(x1; x2; x3) which
is expected from observations on pairs of variables from

P

that component which is intrinsic to the triplet. Observ-
ing the variables in pairs means that we can construct
xk P (xi, xj, xk).
all of the pairwise marginals Pij =
Knowledge of these marginals provides (in general) a par-
tial characterization of the full probability distribution
P (x1, x2, x3). Following Jaynes [13] we can quantify this
knowledge by saying that the pairwise marginals set a
maximum value of the entropy for the full distribution.
More generally, if we have N variables and we observe all
the subsets of k elements, then there is a maximum en-
tropy for the distribution P ({xi}) that is consistent with
all of the k–th order marginals. Let us write this maxi-
mum entropy distribution by ˜P (k)({xi}) and denote the
entropy of a probability distribution by S[P ]; note that

˜P (1)({xi}) =

Pi(xi),

(4)

n

i=1
Y

and that ˜P (N )({xi}) is just the true distribution P ({xi}).
Then we can decompose the multi–information among
the N variables into a sequence of terms:

I({xi}) ≡ S

Pi(xi)

− S[P ({xi})]

(5)

where we deﬁne the connected information of order k,

I (k)
C ({xi}) = S[ ˜P (k−1)({xi})] − S[ ˜P (k)({xi})].

(6)

The connected information of order k is positive or zero;
it represents the amount by which the maximum possible
entropy of the system decreases when we go from know-
ing only the marginals of order k − 1 to knowing also
the marginals of order k. Each time that we increase the
number of elements that we can observe simultaneously
we uncover a potentially richer set of correlations, lead-
ing to a reduction in the maximum possible entropy; the
connected information measures this entropy reduction.
Computing the connected information requires that we
construct the maximum entropy distributions consistent
with marginals of order k. In general this is a diﬃcult
problem. Recall that to maximize the entropy when we
know the expectation values of functions Fµ({xi}), the re-
sulting probability distribution is of the Boltzmann form,
µ λµFµ({xi})], where the λµ are La-
P ({xi}) ∝ exp[−
grange multipliers conjugate to each function [13]. We
can think of each marginal distribution as a set of ex-
pectation values over the full distribution, so that we
need one Lagrange multiplier for each k–tuple of x values.
The distribution ˜P (k) thus has the form of a Boltzmann
distribution with k–body interactions; these interactions
are arbitrary functions which have to be determined by
matching the observed marginals. As an example, for

P

2

three variables with known pairwise marginals the max-
imum entropy distribution takes the form

˜P (2)(x1, x2, x3) =

exp[−λ12(x1, x2)

1
Z
−λ23(x2, x3) − λ31(x3, x1)]. (7)

For a physical system that has at most K–body inter-
actions among the N variables, P (K) will be the exact
distribution. Correspondingly, I (k)

C = 0 for k > K.

In general the functions λ are diﬃcult to determine
from the observed marginals, but this is not the case
for k = 1. This is a well known but important point:
the maximum entropy distribution consistent with one–
body marginals is just the product of the marginals, but
the maximum entropy distribution consistent even with
two–body (pairwise) marginals is not simply written in
terms of the marginals because the observed two–body
correlations include an average over interactions with all
other degrees of freedom. As a result, even the second
order maximum entropy distributions for N variables are
not simply related to the pairwise marginals, and the
second order connected information is not simply related
to the mutual information among pairs of variables; I (2)
C
is larger than the mutual information between any pair
of variables, but is not equal to their sum.

The fact that maximum entropy distributions have an
exponential form, and in the binary or Ising case this
form includes only a ﬁnite set of parameters, connects
our discussion with previous work. A number of authors
have used the maximum entropy distribution for families
of parameterized models as part of statistical tests for
the existence of higher order interactions [4, 8, 14] In re-
lated work, Amari [9] has constructed a geometry on the
parameter space for exponential families using the Fisher
information as a metric, and in this geometry the max-
imum entropy distributions are orthogonal projections
onto subspaces of the full parametric space (see also [5]).
Rather than providing a parametric model of k–th or-
der interactions and determining a conﬁdence level, the
set of I (k)
C provides a quantitative characterization of the
relative importance of various order interactions, inde-
pendent of parameterization.

As examples (Fig. 1), consider three binary or Ising
variables related either by boolean functions (AND, OR,
XOR) or coupled through a pairwise ferromagnetic in-
teractions (FM). For these simple functions, we ﬁnd that
the multi–information is composed of either pure 2-body
interactions or pure 3-body ones, as our intuition sug-
gests. When we add noise either to the input or output
of the boolean functions (Fig. 2) we degrade the corre-
lations, but more interestingly we ﬁnd that pure 2-body
interactions such as AND and OR show a 3-body inter-
action component for some types of noise (even for noise
sources which are state dependent). For the pure 3-body
XOR, noise may result in the appearance of 2-body in-
teractions. For these three functions, input noise only

changes the strength of the existing interactions, rather
than introducing a new kind of eﬀective interaction.

As is familiar in physical examples, if we observe only
some of the elements of a network then the eﬀect of the
hidden elements may be to create new eﬀective interac-
tions among the observed elements. As examples (Fig. 3),
when one hidden binary element determines the nature of
pure pairwise interaction among the remaining elements,
the observable subnetwork can have an eﬀective 3–body
interaction. Alternatively, for a network with only pure
3–body interactions, hidden elements can induce an ef-
fective 2–body interaction among the observables.

order (for example) cannot be written simply in terms of
the mutual information among pairs of variables. Many
previous authors have looked for linear combinations of
mutual information measures which might provide mea-
sures of higher order interaction, and among these one
approach is of particular interest [2, 3, 6, 7, 10]: If we
draw a Venn diagram of regions in the plane correspond-
ing to the variables x1, x2, x3, identifying areas with en-
tropies, then the mutual information I(xi; xj) between
two variables is the area of their intersection, and there
is a unique region shared by all three variables; with the
area–entropy correspondence the size of this “triplet in-
formation” is

I3 =

S(xi) −

S(xi, xj) + S(x1, x2, x3)

I(xi; xj).

This proposal for measuring a pure triplet information
has natural generalizations to more than three variables.
There are at least two diﬃculties with the triplet in-
formation deﬁned by I3 (see a thorough discussion in
[3]). First, despite the identiﬁcation of shared informa-
tion with areas in the plane, we ﬁnd that I3 can be neg-
ative (AND, OR and XOR in Fig. 1). Second, I3 can be
nonzero even for networks that have only pairwise inter-
actions (FM in Fig. 1).

Rather than “triplet information,” I3 actually mea-
sures [2, 3] the information that x1 and x2 together pro-
vide about x3 with the information that these two vari-

I3 = [I(x1; x3) + I(x2; x3)] − I({x1, x2}; x3).

(9)

This comparative measure of information is symmetric
under permutation of the indices, so the labeling of vari-
ables as 1, 2, 3 is arbitrary. If I3 is positive, then any pair
xi and xj are redundant in terms of the information that
they provide about the remaining xk. If I3 is negative,
then there is synergy—two variables taken together are
more informative than they are when taken separately.

The question of synergy and redundancy brings us
back to one of the primary motivations for this analy-
sis. Consider the responses x1, x2, · · · , xN of a collection
of elements to some stimulus y – for example a group
of neurons responding to a sensory stimulus. For each
neuron i we can ask how much information the response
provides about the sensory world, I(xi; y). When we look
at a pair of neurons, we can ask whether these neurons
provide redundant or synergistic information (using eq.
9; see e.g.
[15, 16]). Similarly for a large population of
neurons we can compare the information in the popula-
tion, I({xi}; y), with the sum of informations provided
i I(xi; y). This compari-
by the neurons individually,
son, however, does not tell us whether (for example) the
synergy in the population is the result of pairwise cor-
relations or whether there are special combinations of
responses across all three or more neurons which pro-
vide extra information. The possible signiﬁcance of such
multi–neuron combinatorial events has been discussed for
many years (see e.g. [17, 18, 19]).

P

We recall that the information provided by a popula-

tion of neurons can be written as

I({xi}; y) = S[P ({xi})] − hS[P ({xi}|y)]iy,

(10)

where h· · ·iy denotes an average over the distribution of
sensory inputs. The redundancy of the population is de-
ﬁned as

I(xi; y) − I({xi}; y),

The ﬁrst term is the multi–information in the distribu-
tion of neural responses, which measures the extent to
which the total “vocabulary” of the population is reduced
through correlations, while the second term is the multi–
information in the distribution of responses to a given

stimulus. Each of these terms in turn can be expanded
as a sum of connected informations, so that

where I (k)
C ({xi}|y) is the connected–information of order
k in the network of {xi}, for a given value of y. By
analogy with the discussion of synergy in pairs [16], the
terms I (k)
C ({xi}) quantify the contribution of kth order
interactions to restricting the vocabulary of the popula-
tion response (much as not all k letter combinations form
words in English), while the terms hI (k)
C ({xi}|y)iy quan-
tify the contribution of kth order correlations to reducing
the noise in the population response.

To summarize, the maximum entropy construction of
connected information presented here provides us both
with a method for decomposing the correlations within
a network and for quantifying the contribution of these
correlations to the information that network states can
provide about external signals. Since any part of a net-
work can be thought of as ‘external’ to its compliment,
this uniﬁed discussion of internal correlations and the
representation of external signals is attractive.

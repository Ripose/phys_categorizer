We study the link between three seeming-disparate cases of self-avoiding polymers: strongly over-
lapping multiple chains in dilute solution, chains under spherical conﬁnement, and the onset of
semi-dilute solutions. Our main result is that the free energy for overlapping n chains is indepen-
dent of chain length and scales as n9/4, slowly crossing over to n3, as n increases. For strongly
conﬁned polymers inside a spherical cavity, we show that rearranging the chains does not cost an
additional free energy. Our results imply that, during cell cycle, global reorganization of eukaryotic
chromosomes in a large cell nucleus could be readily achieved.

How are polymers organized inside a conﬁned space?
What is the free energy barrier to the overlapping of two
or more chains in the absence or presence of conﬁne-
ment? Is the barrier higher for longer chains? Recently,
there has been renewed interest in the problem of con-
ﬁned polymers [1, 2, 3, 4], because of its relevance to
such biological processes as DNA packaging in a virus [5]
and organization and segregation of chromosomes in bac-
teria [6].
In eukaryotes, multiple chromosomes are en-
capsulated in a cell nucleus, ı.e., in a dimension many
times smaller than their natural sizes. Although a single
cell can contain as many as billions of basepairs of DNA
(e.g., human), the dimension & 10 µm of cell nuclei im-
plies that the volume fraction of total amount of DNA
is typically much less than that of virus or bacteria, and
the eukaryotic chromosomes in a spherical volume may
be considered as a semi-dilute polymer solution [1]. Here,
one of the key issues is spatial organization of chromo-
somes. The emerging view is that they are compart-
mentalized and occupy discrete “territories” inside a nu-
cleus [7]. However, chromosomes should also be able to
mix, when necessary (e.g., recombination), and, indeed,
they do [8]. Unfortunately, despite its importance, lit-
tle is known about how self-avoiding polymers interact
and are organized in a conﬁned space, whereas the ef-
fective interaction of polymers in dilute (bulk) solution
has been well studied [9]. Although these two subjects,
namely, the eﬀective interaction in dilute solution and
polymers under conﬁnement, have been regarded a dis-
parate grouping so far, as we shall show below, there is
a close connection between the two.

The ﬁrst attempt to characterize the eﬀective inter-
action between two polymeric coils in dilute solution,
each carrying N monomers, was made as early as in
1950 by Flory and Krigbaum [10]. The main conclu-
sion of their “mean-ﬁeld” approach is that the overlap-
ping free energy, ı.e., the free energy cost for bringing
two chains in a volume explored by each chain, scales as

of semi-dilute regime as “stacking spheres.” Above the on-
set concentration, each sphere is independent of one another.
This allows one to map the overlapping chains in (a) onto
those conﬁned in a single sphere in (b) under equivalent con-
ditions – the same chain (sphere) size and the same monomer
concentration – and thus to estimate the overlapping free en-
ergy in (a).

lute temperature.) The repulsion between long chains
is so strong that they should behave as mutually im-
penetrable hard spheres. Partly due to its simplicity,
this picture satisﬁed scientists for about three decades.
Then, the more careful scaling analysis of Grosberg et
al. [11], which takes into account monomer-density corre-
lations [12, 13], showed that the overlapping free energy
is of the order of kBT and is asymptotically indepen-
dent of N . This counter-intuitive result has since been
conﬁrmed by renormalization group calculations [14] and
numerical simulations [15, 16].

The purpose of this Letter is to unravel the link be-
tween a single chain under spherical conﬁnement, a sys-
tem of multiple, strongly overlapping chains in dilute
solution, and the onset of semidilute solution [Figs. 1
and 2], using scaling arguments and molecular dynamics
simulations. The polymers we consider here are ﬂexible
chains with excluded volume, unless otherwise stated. An
important corollary of our analysis is a non-trivial gener-
alization of the aforementioned two-chain result by Gros-
berg et al. to the case of an arbitrary number of chains
[see Fig. 1(a)] in a wide range of monomer concentrations.

It also illuminates the weak dependence of the eﬀective
interaction on polymer concentration studied recently by
Louis et al. [16] using numerical simulations. Biological
implications of our results will also be brieﬂy discussed.
Consider a polymer solution, where its constituent
chains start to touch one another [Fig. 1(b)]. At this
onset of the so-called semi-dilute regime, the solution
can be viewed as stacking of imaginary spheres, where
the size of each sphere, containing a single chain, is ∼Rg,
ı.e., the radius of gyration of each chain in the dilute
regime. Using this “stacking sphere” picture, we can, in
fact, apply the physics of semidilute solutions to estimate
the interaction free energy of multiple chains in dilute so-
lution [Fig. 1(a)]. The essence of our analysis is that,
as the monomer concentration increases above the onset
concentration, each sphere shown in Fig. 1(b) behaves
as an independent replica of the neighboring ones (see
below).

To this end, we ﬁrst consider a long chain formed by
N monomers, compressed inside a spherical cavity of di-
ameter D < Rg. In the case of an ideal chain, it is well
known that the conﬁnement free energy can be obtained
by a random-walk (RW) analysis, where the chain can
be divided into “independent” subchains that start from
one point on the wall and reach another via a random
walk [17]. This is reasonable since, at each “collision”
on the wall, the chain loses its memory of chain con-
nectivity [18]. Since the length of a subchain scales as
Nsub ∼ (D/a)2, where a is the monomer size, the con-
ﬁnement free energy (ı.e., entropy loss of order 1 times
−kBT ) can be straightforwardly obtained by counting
the total number of independent subchains as follows [17]

In the case of a strongly conﬁned chain with ex-
cluded volume [or a conﬁned “self-avoiding walk (SAW)”]
[Fig. 2(a)], the major source of increase of free energy is
the collisions between monomers along the chain. (This
allows us to approximate the spheres in Fig. 2(b) as in-
dependent subsystems.) The conﬁnement free energy
can be obtained by mapping the chain onto an equiv-
alent semidilute solution: In the semidilute regime, this
monomer-monomer contact probability within the sphere
of volume V ≃ D3 can be estimated using the des
Cloizeaux exponent 1/(3ν − 1) [12]. The resulting free
energy is

conﬁnement. (a) Stacking blobs in a moderately-strongly con-
ﬁned self-avoiding chain, ı.e., D ≫ ξ ≫ a. (b) Mixing and

this particle picture provides little insight into the spa-
tial organization of the conﬁned chain. A more intuitive
approach is that of stacking “blobs” [Fig. 2(a)] [3, 19, 20],
where the size of each blob is the correlation length
ξ ∼ a(D3/a3N )ν/(3ν−1) in an equivalent semidilute solu-
tion. We note that Eq. 2 is then self-consistently restored
by the “kBT per blob” ansatz, ı.e., βFSAW ∼ D3/ξ3 [3].
Within the stacking-blob picture (not to be confused
with the stacking-sphere picture), we can view a long
chain with excluded volume conﬁned in a spherical
cavity as a system of overlapping multiple chains. The
basic idea is similar to that of the RW analysis described
above: Each “independent” subchain is a series of
connected blobs [19], which percolates and connects
two points on the conﬁning walls as illustrated by the
red blobs in Fig. 2(a). The number of monomers per
independent subchain, Nsub, can be obtained as follows.

(i) Weakly conﬁned regime (D & ξ ≫ a): In polymer
solution, this is analogous to the onset of the semidilute
regime, where the chains start to contact one another:
ξ ≃ Rg ≃ D, and, thus, Nsub ≃ (D/a)1/ν [Fig. 1(b)].

(ii) Moderately-strongly conﬁned regime (D ≫ ξ ≫
a): This is where both the semidilute regime and the
stacking-blob picture in Fig. 2(a) apply. In other words,
within the correlation length ξ, the chain conformation
is that of SAW, but the global conformation of each in-
dependent chain is described by the RW of blobs. Thus,
Nsub ≃ (ξ/a)1/ν (D/a)2 ≃ (D/a)1/(3ν−1)N (2ν−1)/(3ν−1).
(iii) Concentrated regime (D ≫ ξ ≃ a): In this regime,
excluded volume is screened at all length scales beyond
a [20]. The RW analysis then leads to Nsub ≃ (D/a)2.

Using the expressions of Nsub in (i) and (ii) (the two
regimes of our main interest), we can rewrite Eq. 2 in
terms of the number of independent subchains, n =
N/Nsub, to estimate the free energy cost Fn for over-
lapping an arbitrary number (n) of chains. We ﬁnd

(D ≫ ξ ≫ a).

In fact, this is also the free energy cost for bringing
n self-avoiding chains (each carrying N monomers) in
dilute solution to an imaginary sphere of volume vg

each chain would explore otherwise [Fig. 1(a)]. Here,
vg ∼ R3
g ∼ (aN ν)3, a condition compatible with (i).
In higher monomer concentrations compatible with (ii),
the chain size is reduced by “screening” eﬀects [20], and,
thus, vg ∼ (a n1−3ν N ν)3, which explains the larger ex-
ponent in Eq. 4. This rapid increase of Fn with n, as
evidenced in our blob picture, implies a strong repulsion
between two spheres of dense chains, reminiscent of that
between two star polymers (see Discussion for interesting
consequences on chromosome organization).

At ﬁrst glance, this Nsub-independence is surprising –
the increase of free energy due to chain overlapping is
independent of the chain length, where its special case
for n = 2 explains the results by Grosberg et al. [11].
This is a natural consequence of the functional form of
Eq. 2. Furthermore, the exponent 9/4 is identical to
the osmotic pressure exponent in the semidilute regime.
This is not accidental: The monomer density (times a3) is
now translated into n, which should correctly reﬂect the
stronger monomer-density correlation in the semidilute
regime [13, 20].

Importantly, the scaling form in Eq. 2 also implies that
the overlapping free energy is invariant under rearrange-
ment of the chains as illustrated in Fig. 2(b), where each
segregated chain occupies a smaller volume of linear di-
mension d ∼ (D3/n)1/3. The total free energy after seg-
regation is the same as before:

sub.

Also, note that Eqs. 3 and 4 can explain the recent sim-
ulation results by Louis et al. [16]. Their main conclusion
is that the two-chain interaction in a polymer solution is
≈ 2kBT and independent of the monomer concentration
c for c up to the overlap concentration c∗, increasing only
slightly with c above c∗. This weak c dependence is al-
ready apparent from Eq. 3 and 4. In the scaling regime,
the ratio of entropy loss in the dilute regime and the
semidilute regime is only 23/29/4 ≈ 1.7, and, thus, we
predict the two-chain interaction increases only up to 3-
4 kBT from ≈ 2kBT .

To augment our scaling analysis, we also performed
Molecular Dynamics simulations using ESPResSo [21].
In our simulations, the polymer chains are represented
as a bead-spring model. We chose a chain consisting
of N = 1000 beads connected by FENE (spring) bonds
with a purely repulsive Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential
for excluded-volume interactions (monomer-monomer as
well as monomer-wall). The basic length scale in the sim-
ulation is the bead diameter a, energies are measured in
units of the LJ interaction energy ǫ at distance a, and
the mass of a bead m is the mass unit. Consequently,
m/ǫ.
time is measured in units of the LJ time τLJ = a
The FENE bond constant was chosen to be 10ǫ and the

maximal elongation of a bond as 2a. We used a standard
velocity Verlet algorithm with a timestep of 0.01τLJ to
propagate the system, and a Langevin thermostat with
−1
friction constant γ = τ
LJ to keep the system at constant
temperature T = ǫ/kB.

We ran 40 sets of simulations to test a wide degree
of conﬁnement, namely, the radius of conﬁning sphere
R = D/2 lies in the range Rg/4 ≤ R ≤ Rg (where
Rg ≈ 28.3 for N = 1000). We started each set of sim-
ulations by generating a SAW in a large spherical cav-
ity whose size was several times the Rg of the chain.
Then, the size of the conﬁning sphere was gradually re-
duced, forcing the chain radially inward, until it reached
the target value of D (< Rg). Thereafter, we recorded
2 × 104 conformations and associated parameters at ev-
ery 10τLJ. To check the consistency of our simulations,
we ﬁrst computed the pressure, p, of the conﬁned chain,
which is related to the free energy of conﬁnement by
p = − ∂FSAW
or p ∼ φFSAW/N , where V ≃ D3 is the
volume of sphere and φ ≃ N a3/D3 the volume fraction
of the chain. Since Eq. 2 can also be expressed in terms
of φ as FSAW ∼ N φ1/(3ν−1), we obtain an equivalent
scaling for the pressure p ∼ φ3ν/(3ν−1) ≃ φ9/4. This re-
lation is indeed conﬁrmed by our simulations (data not
shown), which lead to p ∼ φ2.27±0.02 for φ < 0.75 and
are in excellent agreement with the recent Monte Carlo
simulations by Cacciuto and Luijten [4].

Next, we tested the validity of the stacking blob hy-
pothesis illustrated in Fig. 2(a).
If the blobs can be
considered as impenetrable hard spheres of diameter ξ
stacked together, their radial monomer density proﬁle in
the spherical cavity tends to be uniform, except within a
length of order ξ from the wall. Our simulation conﬁrms
this: In Fig. 3(a), we show 40 radial density proﬁles, ρ(r),
from our simulations, which have been normalized such
R
0 ρ(r)dr = 1. Note that ρ(r) is indeed constant for
that
a signiﬁcant range of r. This feature is particularly pro-
R
nounced when we compare it with that of an ideal chain
ρid(r) = (1/2πR) sin2(πr/R)/r2 [see Fig. 3(a) inset for
the case of R = 18.0 = 0.64Rg]. The decay near r = R
manifests the existence of a depletion layer of length scale
ξ from the conﬁning wall. One interesting observation is
that, at high volume fraction (φ & 0.15), the density be-
comes oscillatory near the wall. This means that the wall
collaborates in enhancing the ordering – it is the signa-
ture of the crossover from the semidilute regime (ξ ≫ a)
to the concentrated regime (ξ ≃ a) mentioned above. In-
deed, we simulated a system of N = 1000 hardspheres
by removing the bonds between monomers in our simu-
lations, and observed the same oscillations in ρ(r) (data
not shown in Fig. 3).

Our ﬁnal and the most important test concerns the
view of a single conﬁned chain with excluded volume
as signiﬁcantly overlapping multiple, independent sub-
chains. If this view is correct, the average internal dis-
tance between a pair of monomers i and j, R(|i − j|) =

|i − j|. The inset shows the internal distance R(|i − j|) be-
comes saturated beyond |i − j| ≈ Nsub, due to the “reﬂect-
ing” wall. At low concentrations (weakly conﬁned chains, ı.e.,
ξ ∼ D, represented by blue and green curves), the data tend
to collapse when |i − j| is rescaled by Nsub = (R/a)1/ν. For
the strongly conﬁned case D ≫ ξ ≫ a, however, the correct
rescaling factor is (ii) Nsub = (R/a)1/(3ν−1)N (2ν−1)/(3ν−1).
These results support the independent-chain assumption.

In other words,

h|~xi − ~xj |i, should increase as their contour distance in-
creases up to its maximum value |i − j| = Nsub. Beyond
|i − j| = Nsub, however, the monomers are independent,
and their average distance is constant Rmax(|i − j|) ≈ R
[see Fig. 3(b) inset].
for any chain
length N and a conﬁning sphere radius R, the reduced
internal distance curves, R(|i − j|)/R vs |i − j|/Nsub,
should collapse onto each other. In Fig. 3(b), we verify
the independent-chain hypothesis, where we rescale the
whole set of internal distance curves shown in the inset
with the two diﬀerent expressions of Nsub: (i) Nsub ≃
(D/a)1/ν and (ii) Nsub = R1/(3ν−1)N (2ν−1)/(3ν−1). Note
that, for weakly conﬁned chains (represented in blue and
green), the curves collapse nicely when rescaled by (i)
[as well as by (ii) for the the size of chain N = 1000 we
simulated]. As the degree of conﬁnement becomes strong

4

(e.g., red curves), rescaling by (ii) produces a much bet-
ter result, supporting our argument above. In both cases,
we note that the plateau starts at |i − j|/Nsub ≈ 1.

Our results have implications for spatial organization
of chromosomes inside a eukaryotic cell nucleus. While
the eukaryotic chromosomes have several levels of high-
order structures, the length scale that characterizes the
dsDNA and chromatin ﬁber is typically . 100 nm, much
smaller than the size of the cell nucleus & 10 µm.
It is thus conceivable that the global organization of
these molecules in conﬁnement will not sensitively reﬂect
molecular details (e.g., structure of chromatin ﬁber), and,
importantly, our analysis in Fig. 2(b) implies that the free
energy cost for global chromosome reorganization is low.
On the other hand, once territories are formed (by pro-
teins and DNA cross-linkings), the structured, compact
and segregated chromosomes, are likely to exclude each
other, since the overlapping of tightly packed blobs (such
as star polymers) is highly costly (Fn) for large n, as
mentioned earlier. Further consideration of other factors
including the role of chain stiﬀness and the geometry of
conﬁned space is certainly warranted.

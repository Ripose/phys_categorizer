Due to its polyionic character the DNA double helix is stable and biologically active only in salty
aqueous media where its charge is compensated by solvent counterions. Monovalent metal ions are
ubiquitous in DNA environment and they are usually considered as the possible driving force of
sequence-dependent modulations of DNA structure that make it recognizable by proteins. In an
eﬀort to directly examine this hypothesis, MD simulations of DNA in a water drop surrounded by
vacuum were carried out, which relieves the requirement of charge neutrality. Surprisingly, with
zero concentration of counterions a dodecamer DNA duplex appears metastable and its structure
remains similar to that observed in experiments.

PACS numbers: 87.14.Gg; 87.15.Aa; 87.15.He

It has been long recognized that, because of the
polyionic nature of DNA, solvent counterions are re-
quired for its stability, and that gross structural changes
in DNA can be provoked by changing the concentration,
the charge or the type of counterions [1]. More recently
it has been proposed that free ions might also act as bio-
logical regulators because, by binding to DNA, they can
provoke conformational deformations recognized by spe-
ciﬁc proteins [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The most controversial
is the role of the common monovalent cations Na+ and
K+. They are ubiquitous in the DNA environment and
can be readily available for any purpose. Until recently,
they remained invisible in experimental DNA structures
because it is diﬃcult to detect them in water, and it
has been suggested that they are perhaps responsible for
the most widespread deformations of the double helix,
namely, narrowing of the minor groove and bending. It
is assumed that counterions are sequestered in the minor
groove of some sequences, which brakes the symmetry of
the repulsive electrostatic forces and provokes deforma-
tions. This model is general and it easily explains other
puzzling eﬀects in DNA structure.

The above hypothesis is supported by many recent
studies. Penetration of monovalent cations into the mi-
nor DNA groove has been conﬁrmed by X-ray diﬀraction
[8, 9, 10, 11], NMR spectroscopy [12, 13], and MD sim-
ulations [3, 14, 15, 16, 17]. However, it appears diﬃcult
to ﬁnd a discriminating set-up for testing the cause and
consequence relationship between the ions and the DNA
structure. All available evidences have more than one
interpretation making this problem highly controversial
[18, 19, 20]. For example, correlations between ion posi-
tions and the local groove width observed in MD cannot
answer whether the ions perturb DNA or they just bind
“opportunistically” in the sites of low potential near al-
ready deformed double helix [17]. To clarify the issue
of cause and eﬀect one would have to remove solvent
ions and check if the supposed counterion eﬀects disap-

pear with them. Unfortunately, a counterion-free DNA
does not exist in nature whereas the most reliable compu-
tational procedures presently employed require that the
simulation cell that holds DNA carries zero net charge.
Therefore, in both simulations and experiments the coun-
terion eﬀects cannot be completely eliminated.

In an eﬀort to directly address this question I have
adapted the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm [21, 22] for
modeling dynamics of DNA in a water drop surrounded
by vacuum. Particle-mesh calculations with vacuum
boundary conditions are long known in physics [23], but,
to my knowledge, they were never applied to chemical
or biological systems. Free vacuum boundaries are in-
tuitively most simple and they allow one to relieve the
problems of charge neutrality and possible artifacts from
interactions between periodical images. I describe here
the ﬁrst such “naive” all atom simulations of DNA in
water, with unperturbed Coulomb electrostatics. It ap-
pears that, with zero concentration of counterions, a do-
decamer DNA duplex is metastable and its structure re-
mains similar to that observed in experiments.

The Dickerson-Drew dodecamer (CGCGAATTCGCG,
[24]) in a canonical B-DNA conformation [25] is sur-
rounded by a spherical drop of 4000 TIP3P water
Initially, the drop had around 50 ˚A in
molecules [26].
diameter and in dynamics it remained roughly spheri-
cal. A rectangular unit cell is constructed around the
drop with the minimal separation of 25 ˚A between the
water molecules and the cell sides. The cell is repli-
cated periodically, which gives an inﬁnite lattice of wa-
ter drops with at least 50 ˚A spacing between the clos-
est neighbors. A shifted Coulomb’s law is used, with
U (rij ) = zizj(1/rij − 1/R0) for rij < R0 and U (rij ) = 0
for longer distances, where R0 = 50 ˚A, which eliminates
any interactions between periodical images. Because this
shifting does not aﬀect the forces, the system behaves in
dynamics as if surrounded by inﬁnite vacuum. Within
the drop the electrostatics are eﬀectively evaluated with
a cut-oﬀ of 50 ˚A, which is larger than the DNA size and
applies only to a small fraction water molecules at oppo-

site poles of the drop. Larger distances were also tested,
but showed no noticeable diﬀerence. The Van-der-Waals
interactions are computed with a conventional cut-oﬀ of
9 ˚A.

The shifted Coulomb interactions are evaluated by us-
ing the SPME method [22]. The shifting is taken into
account in the reciprocal sum by replacing the Fourier
transform of 1/r with that of the shifted law. The re-
sulting series is absolutely convergent regardless of the
system charge. The values of energies and forces thus ob-
tained have been veriﬁed by direct computation without
cut-oﬀs. Modiﬁcations in the direct sum are not neces-
sary if we are only interested in the forces and not in the

absolute energy values. It can be shown that this sim-
ple procedure is essentially equivalent to mathematically
more complex earlier formulations of the Ewald method
for cluster calculations [23, 28]. In dynamics, the shape
of the drop ﬂuctuates and the size of the unit cell is ad-
justed accordingly at every time step. Evaporated water
molecules are detected and excluded from calculations to
prevent explosion in the cell size. After every 50 ps the
calculation is stopped and water molecules that have left
the drop are re-introduced with zero velocities by scatter-
ing them randomly near the surface of the drop. The rate
of evaporation was around 84 mol/ns, that is on average
four molecules had to be re-introduced at each stop.

All calculations were carried out with AMBER98 pa-
rameters [29, 30] by using the ICMD method [31, 32, 33]
with the time step of 0.01 ps. Two control simulations of
the same dodecamer have been carried out for compari-
son. In the ﬁrst, 22 Na+ ions were included in the same
water drop. The second represents a conventional cal-
culation in a rectangular unit cell including DNA, 3901
water molecules, and 22 Na+ ions by the original SPME
method with periodical boundary conditions. The tra-
jectories were continued to 5 ns.

Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the charged drop from
the last nanosecond of the trajectory. The system ap-
pears metastable in the nanosecond time range. The
DNA molecule shows no signs of denaturation. The wa-
ter media remains continuous without internal bubbles.
The surface of the drop is covered by spiky “protuber-
ances” which reduce with increased drop size and disap-
pear if DNA is neutralized by counterions. The DNA
structures averaged over the last 2.5 ns of the three tra-
jectories are characterized in Table I. These data indicate
that with zero counterion concentration this dodecamer
DNA molecule remains in B-form. It is understood that
with increased DNA length it should have exploded be-
cause otherwise the electrostatic energy would go to in-
ﬁnity. However, no such trend is seen in Table I, which
indicates that critical lengths of catastrophic deforma-
tions are much larger whereas the dodecamer B-form is
metastable in water even if it is charged.

The scales of diﬀerences between the DNA conforma-
tions in the three trajectories are well characterized by
the data in Table I and they were always far from statis-
tically signiﬁcant. The corresponding experimental data
are available only for the twist, namely, its value drops by
0.1◦ when the NaCl concentration is reduced from 0.3M
to 0.05M [35]. A shift by 0.1◦ in the average twist is too
small to be detected in a 5 ns simulation because, for
this relatively small molecule, its ﬂuctuations between
consecutive 1 ns averaged structures can reach 1.0◦. The
absolute twist value is lower than in experiment, which is
a known general feature earlier discussed in the literature
[29].

The most famous feature of this DNA molecule is the
middle AATT fragment. It is long known from experi-

FIG. 2:
(a) The time evolution of the proﬁle of the minor
groove in Tj1. The surface plots are formed by time-averaged
successive minor groove proﬁles, with that on the front face
corresponding to the ﬁnal DNA conformation. The groove
width is evaluated by using space traces of C5’ atoms [34].
Its value is given in angstr¨oms and the corresponding canoni-
cal B-DNA level of 7.7 ˚A is marked by the thin straight lines
on the faces of the box. Note that the groove width can be
measured only starting from the third base pair from both
termini.
(b) The minor groove proﬁle averaged over the last nanosec-
ond of Tj1. The central trace represents the average groove
width with rms ﬂuctuations shown as error bars. The upper
and lower solid traces show the maximal and minimal values,
respectively. The dotted trace exhibits the proﬁle observed
in the experimental X-ray structure [24]. The canonical B-
DNA groove width is marked by the horizontal dashed line.
Despite the narrowing, the groove width remains larger than
the canonical value [34], which corresponds to the lower aver-
age twist.

ments that the minor DNA groove always narrows in this
and some similar sequences, called A-tracts, and widens
outside of them. Figure 2 exhibits dynamics of the minor
groove in Tj1 and its average proﬁle over the last nanosec-
ond. It has a characteristic waving shape with a narrow-
ing in the middle. The amplitude of this modulation is
similar to that in the experimental X-ray structure. The
minimal width is 1.5 ˚A larger than experimental value,
which is probably linked mechanically to the lower av-
erage twist. Similar results were obtained for the other
two trajectories and they are close to earlier reported
simulation studies carried out with non-zero counterion
concentrations [5].

The sequence-dependent groove-width modulations in
DNA are well established experimentally and, in the re-
cent years, they have been proposed to result from in-
teractions with bound monovalent metal ions commonly
undetectable in X-ray crystal maps [2, 4, 17]. The present
results evidence that it is not the case, supporting recent
conclusions of diﬀerent groups [13, 19, 20]. They explain
also why groove modulations and intrinsic DNA bending
could be reproduced in MD simulations with simpliﬁed
treatment of electrostatic interactions that ignored spe-
ciﬁc counterion eﬀects [36, 37, 38].

According to the counterion condensation theory, DNA
in aqueous environment should be always covered by a
shell of counterions and its charge should be compen-
sated by around 75% regardless of the bulk ion concen-
trations [39]. The results presented here do not contra-
dict this theory but they are somewhat at odds with an
implicit assumption that the counterion cloud is critical
for the native DNA structure. This was surprising, at
least for the author, and suggests that we are still far
from complete understanding of interactions that control
the DNA structure. The correlations observed in ear-
lier MD simulations[17] apparently are due to binding
of counterions in sites of low potential near an already
narrowed minor groove, therefore, these interactions are
structure-speciﬁc rather than sequence-speciﬁc, and they
cannot be the driving force of the corresponding DNA
deformations.

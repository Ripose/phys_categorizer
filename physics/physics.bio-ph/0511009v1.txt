Torsional ﬂuctuations in columnar DNA assemblies

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

In columnar assemblies of helical bio-molecules the azimuthal degrees of freedom, i.e. rotations
about the long axes of molecules, may be important in determining the structure of the assemblies
especially when the interaction energy between neighbouring molecules explicitly depends on their
relative azimuthal orientations. For DNA this leads to a rich variety of mesophases for columnar
assemblies, each categorized by a speciﬁc azimuthal ordering. In a preceding paper [A.Wynveen,
D. J. Lee, and A. A. Kornyshev, Eur. Phys. J. E, 16, 303 (2005)] a statistical mechanical theory
was developed for the assemblies of torsionally rigid molecues in order to determine how thermal
ﬂuctuations inﬂuence the structure of these mesophases. Here we extend this theory by including
torsional ﬂuctuations of the molecules, where a DNA molecule may twist about its long axis at the
cost of torsional elastic energy. Comparing this with the previous study, we ﬁnd that inclusion of
torsional ﬂuctuations further increases the density at which the transition between the hexagonal
structure and the predicted rhombic phase occurs and reduces the level of distortion in the rhombic
phase. As X-ray diﬀraction may probe the 2-D lattice structure of such assemblies and provide
information concerning the underlying interaction between molecules, we have also calculated cor-
relation functions for the azimuthal ordering which are manifest in an x-ray scattering intensity
proﬁles.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Condensed DNA exists in a rich variety of phases and mesophases. Molecular assemblies of DNA are considered to
be lyotropic, so much of this rich phase structure may be accessed by changing the concentration of DNA in solution.
As the concentration of DNA molecules is increased, the orientations of the molecules evolve from a completely
disordered isotropic phase into a liquid crystal phase. Eventually at large enough densities, long range order is
established, and a crystalline state is established [1]. In the liquid crystal phase, various mesophases are observed
[2, 3, 4, 5]. At relatively low concentrations the DNA molecules form a cholesteric mesophase, whereas at larger
concentrations the molecules form columnar assemblies. We should point out that not only is DNA concentration a
parameter in determining what mesophase the DNA is in, but other factors such as monovalent salt concentration,
as well as the type and quantity of condensing agent used, are equally important [6, 7]. Hence, any analytical study
is necessarily quite involved due to the complexity system.

Many of these mesophases have been seen in biological systems [8]. Determining how these mesophases form is
important for understanding how DNA packs into viral capsids and sperm heads [6] and may also be relevant in
the advancement of gene therapies [9, 10]. The study of x-ray diﬀraction patterns of such mesophases, as well as
an understanding of the statistical physics underlying DNA assemblies, could well elucidate the nature of the forces
between such molecules [11]. Furthermore, understanding how properties of these mesophases might depend on the
sequence of base pair text of the DNA that form the mesophase may reveal information concerning the process of
homologous recognition of genes [12].

Another question that might be probed in the study of DNA mesophases is whether the interaction between
molecules depends on the azimuthal orientations of the DNA about their long axes. The polyelectrolyte model
[13, 14, 15] assumes that the forces between molecules are independent of the azimuthal orientations of the molecules.
This is only valid if the azimuthal dependence of the force is very weak or is completely screened by the solvent and
its constituent ions. This model, however, is insuﬃcient to describe the various mesophases. An alternative model
[16] was proposed, which took into account the helical nature of the surface charge patterns on the DNA molecule.
In this model the interaction energy of a pair of molecules depends strongly on the azimuthal orientation out to
separations of R > 30˚A. This azimuthal dependence was further enhanced when counterions were assumed to be

preferentially adsorbed within the grooves of the molecule [17]. Such an azimuthal dependence was indeed shown to
inﬂuence both the structures of columnar [18] and cholesteric assemblies [19].

In Ref.

[18] it was shown that the variety of states observed in columnar assemblies are intrinsically linked
with the azimuthal orientation of the molecules. These states corresponded to diﬀerent “spin”-orderings, i.e. the
conﬁguration of the relative azimuthal orientations between neighboring molecules, of the molecules situated on the
two-dimensional lattice of a columnar assembly. For example, there exist “ferromagnetic” and “antiferromagnetic”
states, i.e. states corresponding to where all the molecules are azimuthally aligned and to where molecules along
a lattice direction have alternating values for their azimuthal orientations. In a later work [20], we extended this
ground state calculation [18] to incorporate the eﬀects of thermal ﬂuctuations to build up a full statistical mechanical
model of the columnar assemblies. Here, two new transitions were observed for a ﬁxed hexagonal lattice. The
ﬁrst corresponded to a transition from one of two topologically distinct states of a three-spin conﬁguration, where
nearest neighbors of a molecule have one of two diﬀerent azimuthal orientations (referred to as the Potts state), to
a more disordered state where both topologies were equally likely in the system. The second was a transition to a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless like vortex state [21]. Here, also, it was shown that the antiferromagnetic state was
only stable when the two-dimensional hexagonal lattice was distorted. Allowing for these lattice distortions, a phase
transition occurring between this rhombic (distorted hexagonal) antiferromagnetic state and the ferromagnetic state
is observed. As compared to the ground state calculations, incorporating thermal ﬂuctuations resulted in a decrease
in the mean separation between molecules at which this transition occurred, a reduction in the amount the distortion
to the hexagonal lattice, and a shift from a second order transition to a ﬁrst order one. In both of these studies
[18, 20], however, the DNA molecules were assumed to be completely rigid.

Torsional ﬂexibility has been considered in a ground state calculation of interacting nonhomolgous DNA [22]
where the reduction of sequence-dependent distortions due to electrostatic interactions between the molecules is
observed. This present study, however, considers the eﬀects of thermal excitations of the ﬂexible molecules so
that torsional ﬂuctuations,
in which the azimuthal orientation of the double helix is no longer uniform along
the length of the molecule, occur. Such eﬀects may be implemented relatively easily into an energy functional,
which forms a starting point for the statistical mechanical treatment. Previously, for rigid molecules, the eﬀect of

longer such a trivial parameter in the theory. Here, shortening the molecules plays a similar role to increasing the
torsional rigidity since the free energy cost of twisting a short molecule to the same degree, i.e. the same variation
in the azimuthal angle between the ends of the molecule, of that of twisting a longer molecule is much greater.
Hence, very short molecules may be assumed to be rigid. Furthermore, as a molecule is lengthened beyond a certain
torsional persistence length, the extent of the torsional ﬂuctuations becomes independent of the length of the molecule.

Though formulating the energy functional and partition function for columnar assemblies of ﬂexible molecules is
a relatively simple task, calculating the free energy and other thermodynamic quantities is not. Due to the extra
degrees of freedom associated with torsional ﬂuctuations, Monte-Carlo methods become less reliable and more
time consuming. Utilizing self-consistent approximations developed through ﬁeld theoretical methods, however, we
encounter a problem arising from treating molecules of ﬁnite length; how to account for the freely ﬂuctuating ends of
the molecules in the assembly. Nevertheless, we have managed to incorporate free end eﬀects into the ﬁeld theoretical
calculations and have determined the extent to which they alter the results.

The layout of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we consider the case of ﬁnite temperature interactions between
two molecules in parallel juxtaposition as a starting point for developing the present calculations since the reliability
of the these calculations may be tested against the “Quantum Mechanical” formulation of DNA interactions set
[23]. In Sec. III we summarize the results of the various ground state calculations of the system and
out in Ref.
then incorporate thermal ﬂuctuations at the harmonic level (Gaussian ﬂuctuations) for the diﬀerent conﬁgurations
of the columnar assembly. Here, we determine the free energy of the assembly as well as the correlation function

interaction, developing a self-consistent approximation for the assembly. This relies on a Hartree approximation for
the case where the ends satisfy periodic boundary conditions, i.e. both ends of a molecule have the same azimuthal
orientation, and a correction which takes into account independent ﬂuctuations at the ends of each molecule.
At this level of the calculation, we demonstrate how torsional ﬂuctuations aﬀect the free energy and correlation
functions of the assemblies and compare these results to those of assemblies composed of rigid molecules [20]. We
ﬁnd that the correction accounting for independent ﬂuctuations of the ends of the molecules is quite small, and so
in ﬁrst approximation may be neglected, demonstrating that the utilization of periodic boundary conditions in the

II. HOW TO TREAT MOLECULES OF FINITE LENGTH: THE 2-BODY PROBLEM

Our primary aim is to develop a ﬁeld theoretical framework in which to treat the statistical mechanics of ﬂexible
molecules condensed in columnar assemblies. As mentioned in the introduction, we ﬁrst encounter the problem of
how to treat molecules of ﬁnite length. If we assume that periodic boundary conditions can be applied to the ends of
the molecules, however, we may take advantage of ﬁeld theoretical techniques that already have been developed [24].
By assuming periodic boundary conditions we presuppose that both ends of a DNA molecule ﬂuctuate torsionally
in phase. In other words, both ends share the same azimuthal orientation, which isn’t necessarily the case. And so
within our statistical mechanical treatment, we also take into account freely ﬂuctuating ends of the molecules.

Before turning our attention to an assembly, we begin by ﬁrst considering two molecules in parallel. One of the
main motivations for doing this is that for the pair interaction, an alternative approach for formulating the statistical
mechanics of interactions between ﬂexible molecules, which resembles that of a quantum mechanical problem, may
be employed [23]. This, then, provides a check on the reliability of the formulation with which we use to treat the
assemblies.

The pair potential is a function of the interaxial separation R and the relative azimuthal angle φ between molecules.
φ2,
The relative azimuthal angle is deﬁned as the diﬀerence in the azimuthal angles between the two molecules, φ = φ1−
where φi is the angle that a vector, from the center of the ith molecule to the middle of its minor groove, makes with
an axis that lies perpendicular to the long axes of the molecules. This axis is chosen to pass through the centers of
both molecules. The pair potential energy per unit length has the form

Eint(R, φ) =

1)nan(R) cos(nφ).

(2.1)

−

n=0
X

Equation (2.1) is completely model independent and can be deduced purely from symmetry requirements. The
ﬁrst requirement is that rotation of one of the molecules one whole revolution about its long axis should leave the
interaction energy unchanged. Hence we may express Eint as a Fourier expansion in terms of the relative azimuthal
angle. Secondly, for DNA molecules, helical symmetry dictates that Eint(R, φ) = Eint(R,
φ), so only cosine terms
H, where H is the helical pitch of the DNA molecule,
in the Fourier series are retained. Finally, provided that L
helical symmetry also ensures that the interaction energy per unit length does not depend on z, where z is the
coordinate that runs along the long axis of the molecule.

Before proceeding further, we need to consider the behavior of then ancoeﬃcients. We shall use forms for these
coeﬃcients obtained within the Kornyshev-Leikin (KL) theory [16] of the electrostatic interactions between helical
macromolecules. Such a treatment, grounded in Debye-Huckel theory, neglects important non-local eﬀects [25, 26, 27]
of the dielectric response of explicit water. However, such a theory can still provide a qualitative picture into the
behavior of our system. Furthermore, this theory should work quite well at suﬃciently large enough separations
between molecules and for dilute salt concentrations where Debye-Huckel theory is valid. Explicit forms for the an
coeﬃcients obtained in such a theory are given in Ref. [23]. In the theory, all of the an coeﬃcients decay exponentially
with large interaxial separations with higher order terms (larger n) decaying at a greater rate. (The inverse decay
lengths κn for each these terms is given by κn =
s, where g = 2π/H and κs is the inverse Debye screening
length calculated in Donnan equilibrium [18, 20, 28].) Because of this, it is suﬃcient to truncate the series given
in Eq. (2.1) at n = 2 [16]. The zeroth-order term a0, which describes the interaction between two cylinders with a
uniform charge distribution, does not depend on φ and therefore need not be considered in the treatment of torsional
ﬂuctuations. However, it does play an important role in the positional structure of the assembly. Finally, since a2
decays faster than a1, minimizing the interaction energy with respect to φ leads to a conﬁguration below a critical
value R

partition function.

As was discussed previously in Ref. [23], with this partition function the problem can be recast in an alternative

the calculation of F are given in Appendix A. Here, we shall quote the end result for long molecules

In Eq. (3.1) we have included only the interactions between nearest neighbors and have assumed that all the DNA
molecules are of the same length with the center of each molecule lying at z = 0 [30]. Again we may truncate the
series at n = 2. In calculating the energy of the lattice, we have allowed for two separations,R1 and R2, of the six
nearest neighbors of a given molecule, since there may be distortions from the hexagonal lattice [18, 20]. For this
distorted or “rhombic” lattice, R1 corresponds to the distance to the neighboring molecule at an adjacent corner of
the unit cell while R2 is the distance across the short diagonal of the rhombic cell. We may deﬁne a distortion angle ω
(shown in Fig. 1) that characterizes the relationship between the two separations in Eq. (3.1), R2 = R1√2
2 cos ω.
In the ground state, the amount of distortion is determined by minimization of E[φ] with respect to the distortion
angle ω. The relative strengths of the a coeﬃcients determine the degree of this distortion, e.g. the a0 term, which
contributes a repulsive component to the overall force, has the eﬀect of reducing the amount of rhombic distortion as
on its own it favors a hexagonal state. For certain azimuthal conﬁgurations of the molecules at large densities, the
distortion angle ω is greater than 60o.

−

Before considering eﬀects of thermal ﬂuctuations, let us ﬁrst describe the various ground states that the assembly
has. When molecular separations are large, all the relative azimuthal orientations of the molecules are the same.
This state may be referred to as the “ferromagnetic” state. For this state the lattice is hexagonal, R1 = R2. Below
a critical value of the separation of nearest neighbors, R1
, the assembly adopts a new state where four of the six
∗
nearest neighbors about a speciﬁc molecule adopt a diﬀerent azimuthal orientation to that molecule, as shown in Fig.
2. This state then may be termed the “antiferromagnetic” state. This conﬁguration of the azimuthal orientations of

IV. ASSEMBLIES OF MOLECULES OF FINITE LENGTH: THE SELF-CONSISTENT
APPROXIMATION.

Near the point of frustration, i.e. the location of the transition between the distorted “antiferromagnetic” state
and the hexagonal “ferromagnetic” state, the ﬂuctuations become quite large so that the Gaussian approximation is
no longer valid. Thus we must extend the calculation by using a self-consistent approximation, namely, a Hartree
approximation. Unfortunately, we were unable to ﬁnd a Hartree approximation that takes into account freely
ﬂuctuating ends of the molecules, but it is possible to treat this contribution as a small correction to the Hartree
approximation for periodic boundary conditions. In such an approximation it is possible to determine how torsionally
softening or changing a molecule’s length alters the value of R1
(T ), the separation at which the phase transition
∗
occurs. Furthermore, the correlation functions of the previous section also can be calculated within this approximation.

The self-consistent approximation ﬁrst entails carrying out a series expansion of Eq. (3.1) in powers of φ′ where
3) or greater, are treated as perturbations to the Gaussian approximation. The value

anharmonic terms, terms of O(φ′
of ψ is determined through the requirement that

(Details of such a perturbation expansion are given in Appendix E) Terms for the correlation function and the free
energy, where periodic boundary conditions are assumed, may be re-summed in a similar fashion to the Hartree
approximation calculations of Refs. [20, 23]. Following similar steps (given in Appendix F), we obtain the following
Hartree result for the free energy per molecule

It is quite interesting to look at the Hartree result for the ferromagnetic state for inﬁnitely long molecules, which
is very similar to the result given in Ref. [23] for a pair of molecules, since it provides some insight into the nature
of the many body eﬀects of the assembly. There are two diﬀerences: ﬁrst of all, λp is replaced by λpC−
mb, where
Cmb is a constant resulting from the many body eﬀects of the assembly; and secondly, an overall factor of three that
multiplies the free energy is included to account for the coordination number of nearest neighbors about a molecule.
We calculate that
0.560 so we ﬁnd many body eﬀects suppress thermal ﬂuctuations. This is not surprising
considering that the many neighbors in the assembly should increase the eﬀective interaction between molecules.
Therefore, thermal ﬂuctuations of the same magnitude in the assembly cost more energy than that for a single pair

conﬁgurational states of Ref. [20]. Taking the limit of these equations, i .e. the molecules are treated as completely
rigid, also yields this same result. This is fully consistent with the physics we might expect. As we shorten the length
of the molecule, the energy cost of torsional ﬂuctuations begins to counter the reduction in free energy due to the
entropy gain associated with them. And so with decreasing length, these ﬂuctuations become suppressed and rigid
body ﬂuctuations start to dominate.

We ﬁrst examine how the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic hexagonal state and antiferromagnetic rhomic
state changes with the length and ﬂexibilty of the molecules assuming periodic boundary conditions. Equating the
free energy of the antiferromagnetic state with that of the ferromagnetic state, Eqs. (4.2)-(4.4), we can determine the
location of the transition between the two states. The location of this transition in terms of the average interaxial
spacing between molecules in the assembly as a function of molecular length is shown in Fig. 3 for molecules
with varying torsional ﬂexibilities.
Increasing the ﬂexibility of the molecule results in the transition moving to
larger densities (smaller interaxial spacings) as one might expect. With increasing ﬂexibility, there is an increase
in thermally induced torsional ﬂuctuations and so the location of the transition as the ﬂexibility is increased moves
in the same direction as when the molecule is shortened, where thermally induced rigid-body ﬂuctuations become
larger. Also shown, in Fig. 4, is the level of distortion (value of the rhombic angle ) from the hexagonal lattice as
a function of the average interaxial spacing for the antiferromagnetic state. As seen in the plot, greater ﬂexibility
reduces the amount of distortion.

Modiﬁcations of the results of the self-consistent Hartree approximation when incorporating corrections for
independently rotating ends of the molecules are quite involved and are left to the appendices. When including these

corrections, however, we ﬁnd that the locations of the transition only shift by hundredths of angstroms for all the
cases shown in Fig. 3. And so the formulation assuming periodic boundary conditions, as long as the molecules are
long enough, adequately describes the system.

We may also calculate correlation functions within the Hartree approximation for periodic boundary conditions.
2 )2.
Here, we may use the results of the previous section, but we now replace λ1 with λH
We then may compute ∆φ and ∆ψ within this approximation. A plot of these quantities is shown in Fig. 5 for a
molecule with a realistic value for its torsional modulus. The correction associated with ﬂuctuations of the free ends
of the molecules only results in small changes in the value of ∆φ. (The formulation of which is again left to the
appendices.) On this plot, we also show the variation of the relative azimuthal angle due to rigid body ﬂuctuations,
∆ψ, for a molecule of the same length. These results are consistent with ﬁts of x-ray diﬀraction data of hydrated
DNA assemblies [11].

Lastly, we show in Appendix H the high temperature expansion for the azimuthally disordered or Kosterlitz-
Thouless vortex phase, mentioned in the introduction, that includes torsional ﬂuctuations. Granted, in the case of
real DNA it is very unlikely that this situation is realized [20]. At larger separations where thermal ﬂuctuations
dominate intermolecular azimuthal interactions, the DNA assembly is likely to lose columnar ordering before such a
transition in the azimuthal conﬁguration of the columnar assembly occurs. Because of this reservation, this work has
not been included in the main text. However, in other helical bio-molecule assemblies where azimuthal interactions
might be weaker but spatial interactions are strong, a Kosterlitz-Thouless like transition could possibly occur within
a smectic layer with short range two-dimensional ordering.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a method for calculating the contribution to the free energy due to azimuthal ﬂuctuations
for torsionally ﬂexible molecules of ﬁnite length. Using this method we can determine the inﬂuence of azimuthal
ﬂexibility of molecules within a DNA columnar assembly on the position of the phase transition between the
antiferromagnetic state where the hexagonal lattice is distorted and the ferromagnetic state for various molecular
lengths. For molecules with torsional moduli of C = 3
cm, the approximate value deduced from
experiments [31], torsional ﬂexibility reduces the separation at which this occurs compared to that found for the
case of rigid molecules. We see that the eﬀects of torsional ﬂuctuations are more pronounced for assemblies of long
molecules, whereas the results for short molecules are little diﬀerent from those rigid body calculations of Ref. [20],
thereby showing that shortening the molecule is nearly equivalent to making the molecule less ﬂexible.

We found that torsional ﬂuctuations considerably reduce the degree of distortion, for long molecules in the
antiferromagnetic state, as compared to that found for calculations for rigid molecules of the same length. Since
ﬂexibility allows for readjustment of the azimuthal coordinate along the length of the molecules in the lattice, less
distortion is required to minimize the free energy of the assembly due to the antiferromagnetic coupling of the
pair potential. Hence, as compared to ground state [18] or ﬁnite-temperature rigid body calculations [20], X-ray
diﬀraction patterns must have even better resolution to pick out this distortion [3].

We were also able to calculate the asymptotic form of the correlation function

φj′l′ (z′)))
i
including both rigid body and torsional ﬂuctuations. This term is found in the formulation of the intensity of x-ray
diﬀraction patterns of assemblies [11] and is therefore a direct means by which one can determine the extent of these
ﬂuctuations. Our results for the parameters chosen agree quite well with the ﬁts made to x-ray diﬀraction data of
hydrated DNA assemblies. Conversely, comparing these ﬁts to the correlation function formulation may reveal the
strength of the azimuthal interaction, which in turn may say something about the charge distribution on the DNA
molecules in the assembly.

−

Although we have discovered a number of eﬀects associated with allowing for torsional ﬂexibility in columnar DNA
assemblies, this analysis, however, is limited by the form of the DNA-DNA interaction [16] we have employed. The
eﬀects of nonlocal polarizability of the water in the narrow interstitial regions between the DNA could alter the results
[25, 26, 27]. Also, the potential assumes a given charge distribution of readsorbed counterions that changes very little

13

with density. Once these eﬀects have been incorporated into the pair potential the same analysis developed here
may be used. But even upon considering these eﬀects, the qualitative aspects of this analysis should remain unchanged.

One may also need to consider the eﬀect of sequence dependent distortions from the ideal double helical structure
seen in real DNA [32, 33, 34, 35] in the analysis of the assemblies. This may well be included in calculations for
assemblies of non-homologous DNA by employing ensemble averaging [34]. Such averaging is easiest in an assembly
[23], these eﬀects may be incorporated into a
made up of with several diﬀerent DNA sequences. Again, as in Ref.
combined persistence length that incorporates both distortions arising from thermal ﬂuctuations and from diﬀerent
base pair sequences of neighboring molecules. For assemblies containing DNA sequences with only a few diﬀerent
texts (and thus diﬀerent distortions from an ideal helix), the interaction is much more diﬃcult to treat and has yet
been considered. Nevertheless, in the case of homologous DNA assemblies, distortions from an ideal helix make lit-
tle diﬀerence as the electrostatic interaction depends only on the relative azimuthal orientations between the molecules.

Finally, we should point out that this is by no means a complete statistical mechanical picture of a columnar
assembly. For example, we have not included lattice vibrations, ﬂuctuations in the z-position of the center of each
molecule, bending ﬂuctuations, nor ﬂuctuations due to other geometrical distortions of each molecule. However,
ﬂuctuations in the azimuthal degrees of freedom are likely the most important feature for determining the structure of
the mesophases of columnar assemblies as seen in the ﬁts of x-ray diﬀraction patterns [11]. Furthermore, coupling of
the azimuthal degrees of freedom to other geometrical distortions, which are likely to be small, may be incorporated
into our model.

We will now, using Eq. (D1), derive expressions for ﬁnite size correction terms for the Gaussian approximation.

But ﬁrst we will need to derive some general results.

Now each Eigen state of Eq. (2.3) is characterised by two numbers; the band number b

0, an integer, and the

wave number in the band 1/2 < k < 1/2, a continuous variable. Each Eigen state should then be written as

(A3)

Here, NP is the number of periods the potential has in φ-space and is proportional to the system size: the range of
values which φ is allowed to take. As φ will ﬂuctuate between
, except at φ+, we take NP to be inﬁnite.
It is easy, then, to show that the following is true

been corrected. Substituting for E0 and E2 we so obtain Eq. (2.6) of the text.

within the ﬁrst Brillouin zone for a rhombic lattice (e.g.
π/r0 < ku < π/r0). We are then able to write in the limit

Now from these expressions let us ﬁnd their behavior when l, j
1. For both GAP (j, l, z, z′) and GP (j, l, z) this
is simple. As j and l increase, the terms in the integrands of GAP (j, l, z, z′) and GP (j, l, z) that depend on j and l
oscillate more rapidly, so that their contribution gets smaller and smaller. So when l, j
1 we may neglect terms
that depend on j and l in both integrands, so arriving at (3.13) and (3.14) of the text. The term G0(j, l) is trickier
as neglecting terms that depend on j and l leads to a logarithmic divergence. It is, however, possible to do one of the
integrations in (D8) (by contour integration around a unit circle) which leads to the following result (for j > 0)

which enables us to perform the resulting integrals, and so we obtain the following diﬀerential equations,

FIG. 7: Diagrammatic representations that contain the leading order corrections to the Gaussian results for ΓF
1 (x, y) and the
free energy F deﬁned in the text. For ΓF
1 (x, y) the ﬁrst graph from the left represents the Gaussian result, the middle graph
the correction from ∆p, and the last graph the correction from ∆f . For F the ﬁrst graph from the left represents the Gaussian
result.. The next graph along is G1, that arises purely from periodic boundary conditions. Third from the left is G2 and the
last is G3. These terms are corrections due to free boundary conditions.

Again, the ﬁrst term, Γ′p, arises purely from periodic boundary conditions and Γ′f is the contribution from allow-
ing the ends to ﬂuctuate independently of each other. Both these terms may be represented diagrammatically in Fig.7.

We may compute the leading order correction to ψ setting Γ1 = 0 and by writing ψ = ψ0 + ψ′ and expanding out

for small ψ′. We may also perform the summations in both Γ′p and Γ′f . We ﬁnd that

Appendix F. Derivation of self consistent approximation for periodic boundary conditions.

Now, for the moment, let us concentrate on periodic boundary conditions and set Γ(x, y) = 0. We may represent
each term in the perturbation theory diagrammatically. The Feynman rules; the correspondence between a graph and
its algebraic expression are now given. On expanding out E[φ(~k)] we need three types of diagrams (or vertices) to
represent each φn-term in this expansion, for n > 0. The Feynman rules are similar to those given in Appendix A of
[20], but with a few modiﬁcations [36]. They are as follows. Each graph will contain NF vertices all of which will be
connected to each other by lines. We assign a label i = 1 . . . NV to each vertex. For each vertex i, representing φn,
we must write down the following for a type 1 or 2 vertex

Each full Feynman graph will also consist of NE external lines (connected to only one vertex) each associated with
a wave vector ~qj = (xj/r0, yj/r0, 2πnj/L) (j = 1, . . . , NE). For each of these external lines we write down Gni (xi, yi)
and set ~ki
in the vertex to which the line is connected. There will
m/L
also be NI internal lines, each associated with a wave vector ~pk(k = 1, . . . , NI ), where each end is connected to two
vertices, i and i′. For each of these internal lines we write down G(~pk) and set ~ki
m in
each of the two vertices. Then all the wave vectors for the internal lines are summed over. Last of all, there is also
a symmetry factor that multiplies this, which accounts for how many ways a term (graph) in the expansion may be
generated. If we restrict the wave vectors to the form ~qj = (xj /r0, yj/r0, 0) we get back the results for the rigid body
case [20].

In the same procedure as discussed in Appendix A of [20], we may replace Gn in each loop (of our diagrammatic
series) with G1n. Now. G1n will be replaced on the l.h.s. of (F5) with a new correlation function G2n. On the r.h.s of
(F5) we replace λ1,1 with λ1,2 and λ2,1 with λ2,2. Expressions for λ1,2 and λ2,2 are similar to (F6), but with λ replaced
by λ1,1 and α replaced by α1 = (λ1,1/λ2,1)2. We then keep iterating this process until we have λH
1,
λH
so obtain Eq. (4.3) of the text. Through same reasoning as was discussed
1 and αH =

in Appendix. B of [20], we ﬁnd that ψ = ψH where

To calculate the free energy we consider the same set of graphs as those considered for free energy in [20] .To get
the free energy in the Hartree approximation we then renormalize the sum of these graphs, by taking care in replacing
λ1 with λH

2 , and α with αH ; and so arrive at Eq. (4.2) of the text.

1 , λ2 with λH

Appendix G. Correction to self consistent approximation for periodic boundary conditions from freely
ﬂuctuating ends.

To calculate the corrections arising from free ﬂuctuating ends we must utilize the results of both the previous
two appendices. We perform a renormalization where we replace λ1, λ2, α and ψ0 with λH
2 , αH and ψH in
the results of Appendix E. The renormalization process relies on counter-terms which take care of terms already
included in λH
2 , αH and ψH , to prevent over-counting. In the interests of brevity we will not discuss this process
of renormalization, instead we refer those not acquainted with such processes to a standard text in ﬁeld theoretical
methods.

[29] Note that Eq. (2.8) is not a unique way of ensuring that φ(−L/2) + γ = φ(L/2). We could have chosen a diﬀerent ansatz.
Nevertheless, the end result is ansatz-independent. Any ansatz that satisﬁes this criterion will yield the same form for the
partition function as long as the correct variable shift to decouple bn from γ is chosen.

[30] Since our primary concern is to study the eﬀects of azimuthal ﬂuctuations of the molecules, we do not consider their spatial
ﬂuctuations about the lattice points. Though coupling between azimuthal ﬂuctuations and spatial ﬂuctuations does occur,
this can be neglected within the ﬁrst approximation.

[36] There was a mistake in the Feynman rules stated in Ref. [20], namely that each vertex represents φ2n and not φn. However,

the correct expression for the Hartree result was obtained in Appendix A of Ref. [20].

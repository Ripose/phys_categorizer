Abstract. Fluctuations of cell state, e.g., abundances of some proteins, have
attracted much attention both theoretically and experimentally. The distribution of
such state over cells, however, is not only a result of intracellular stochastic process,
but is also inﬂuenced by the growth in cell numbers that depends on the state. By
incorporating the growth-death process into the standard Fokker–Planck equation for
the probability distribution, a nonlinear temporal evolution equation of distribution is
obtained that includes a self-consistent growth term. The derived equation is generally
solved analytically by means of eigenfunction expansions. By focusing on the case with
linear relaxation, two examples are considered as applications of the proposed general
formalism. First, by assuming that the growth rate of a cell increases linearly with the
state value x, the shift of the average state value x due to the growth eﬀect is shown to
be proportional to the variance of the state x and the relaxation time, similarly with
the biological ﬂuctuation- response relationship. Second, when there is a gap in the
growth rate at some threshold value for the state x, existence of a critical gap value is
demonstrated, beyond which the average growth rate starts to increase. This critical
value is again obtained in terms of the relaxation time and the variance of x, all of
which are experimentally measurable quantities. The relevance of the results to the
analysis of biological data on the distribution of cell states, as obtained for example
by ﬂow cytometry, is discussed.

1. Introduction

Biological systems suﬀer ﬂuctuations. No intracellular biochemical process can avoid
ﬂuctuations, because they arise from the motion and reaction of molecules. For example,
gene expressions or abundance of some proteins in a cell ﬂuctuate in time or by cells, even
if they are measured at the same time after a cell division, for cells with identical genes
(clones). Indeed, Elowitz has explicitly measured the numeric ﬂuctuations of proteins in
Escheria coli, by distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic ﬂuctuations [1]. Such intracellular
ﬂuctuations have attracted both theoretical and experimental attention [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
while the signiﬁcance of the phenotypic ﬂuctuations for adaptation [8] and evolution
[9, 10] has also been investigated.

In general, let us consider the ﬂuctuation of some quantity x characterizing the
state of a cell, such as the number of proteins or gene expressions. Now, as a result of
intra-cellular dynamics, x ﬂuctuates among cells or in time. Let us denote the single-cell
distribution of x by Psingle(x). In principle, it can be obtained by repeating a single-cell
measurement over an ensemble of cells.

Here, however, we must be careful about the choice of the initial ensemble itself for
such distributions. The initial distribution of cells chosen for an experiment depends
on whether the cell can proliferate or not and the speed of cell replication, which may
depend on the cell state x. Consider, for example, taking an ensemble of cells from a
culture. Then the probability of choosing cells that have higher replication speeds will
be larger, and the initial distribution of x will be biased accordingly.

This problem is prominent in the measurement of cells from continuous cultures
using ﬂow cytometry or some other means [11]. In ﬂow cytometry, the characteristics
of each cell (e.g., the magnitude of ﬂuorescence when a ﬂuorescent protein gene is
introduced) are measured over a huge number of cells.
It is now established as a
standard, powerful tool to measure the distribution of states of cells. Here, if the growth
rate of a cell is independent of the quantity x, the choice of cell ensemble is not biased
by the value x, and thus the observed distribution P (x) by ﬂow cytometry is simply that
given by the distribution Psingle(x). On the other hand, if the growth rate depends on
x, the distribution P (x) may be altered from the distribution from single-cell dynamics.
As an illustration, consider the case in which Psingle(x) is a Gaussian distribution
around x = x0, while the replication rate of a cell increases strongly with x for x > x0,
assuming that x represents the abundance of some chemical that mediates the growth
of the cell. In this case, it is naturally expected that the observed distribution P (x)
should be biased towards x > x0.

In general, the distribution Psingle(x, t) has been studied with the use of stochastic
processes to characterize the intra-cellular dynamics of the state x. Established
mathematical tools such as Master’s equation, Langeving’s equation, and the Fokker–
Planck equation [12, 13] are applied for such studies. On the other hand, as a biological
unit (cell) replicates, the number of cells increases accordingly. This eﬀect of replication,
then, must be incorporated with these stochastic processes, to include both the single-

cell ﬂuctuations and the growth dynamics of the cells together.

Recently, there has been growing interest in exploring the relationship between the
ﬂuctuations of intracellular state and the response of the state to the change in external
conditions, both theoretically and experimentally [1, 6, 14, 15, 16]. For example, a
change in the concentration of some protein (or gene expression) against the change
in the external condition (e.g., concentration of some chemical in the medium) may
be measured experimentally, from which the response of such intracellular state to the
environmental change must be unveiled. Here, however, the growth speed of a cell
generally depends on the intracellular state, e.g., the abundance of such protein, because
the protein is important to the function of the cell. Hence, the measured change of the
protein concentration in response to external change involves both the internal change
of the intracellular state and the change in the cell number distribution caused by the
state-dependent growth rate. Thus, we should develop a theoretical tool to distinguish
the two eﬀects, based on the measurable quantities. In the present paper, by setting up
an equation for P (x, t) that takes into account both the intra-cellular stochastic process
and the state-dependent cell reproduction rate, we address this issue.

We ﬁrst derive the evolution equation of the distribution P (x, t) by extending the
Fokker–Planck equation to incorporate state-dependent growth. (In the present paper,
‘growth’ means the replication of a cell, and the replication rate in time is called the
growth rate). The derived equation includes a term for state-dependent growth, from
which is subtracted the average growth rate over all cells, leading to a source/sink
term that corresponds to the growth/death process of a cell. The average growth rate
gives a self-consistent term that is nonlinear in distribution P (x, t), but we can formally
solve the equation through the eigenvalue properties of a Sturm–Liouville-type operator.
After giving a general formulation of the equation, we present two simple examples of
this formulation, by assuming the linear Langevin equation for the single-cell dynamics
of the state variable. First, by considering the linear dependence of the growth speed
on x, we obtain a formula for the shift of the average value of the state x. The shift is
proportional to the product of the variance of the state, the relaxation time, and the
proportion coeﬃcient of the growth speed with x. For our second example, we study the
case in which there is a threshold value of the state x for growth, and derive a formula
for the change of P (x, t) to ‘feel’ the state-dependent growth. Cautious remarks are
made on the interpretation of the distribution obtained from ﬂow cytometry, while the
relevance of our theory to evolution is also brieﬂy discussed.

Note that we do not discuss speciﬁc mechanism for the cell growth here. Rather,
we introduce a function characterizing state-dependence growth generally and derive
the distribution function.

2. Derivation of the equation for the distribution of cell state with
reproduction

Let us ﬁrst introduce a variable x, which represents a state value of a cell, for example, a
concentration of some chemical (or its deviation from the mean value). We assume that
the temporal evolution of variable x in a single cell obeys some Markovian dynamics,
that is, the value of x at time t is determined only by the value of x at some previous
time. (Although biological systems may often retain some memory, this assumption can
be acceptable as a ﬁrst-step approximation, and indeed is adopted for most models.)
Based on this assumption, we consider the following Langevin equation, which is often
adopted:

dx(t)
dt

−

=

f (x(t)) +

g(x(t)) η(t),

q

where f and g are functions of x(t), that govern the dynamic behavior of the variable
x (the function g must be non-negative for all x); roughly speaking, the function f
represents the force acting on the value toward its mean value and g represents the
strength of the diﬀusion at the value. η(t) is a Gaussian white noise term having the
t2) for any t1 and
statistical properties:

We now introduce the growth (replication) of the cell, whose rate µ is dependent
on the state value of x in the cell, and is a function of x(t), denoted by µ(x(t)). To
derive the equation for the distribution P (x, t) for this growth rate of the cell, we ﬁrst
write down the change in the distribution function at time t + ∆t, given P (x, t) at time
t, as:

ˆP (x, t + ∆t) =

W (x, x′, ∆t)P (x′, t)(1 + µ(x′)∆t)dx′,

where the term (1 + µ(x′)∆t) indicates the eﬀect of cell growth, while W (x, x′, ∆t)
is the transition probability that the system changes from the state with x′ to that
with x during the time interval ∆t, which is determined by the Langevin equation (1)
uniquely. Because of cell growth, the distribution function ˆP (x, t + ∆t) obtained above
is not normalized in general, while the distribution P (x, t) must be normalized. To
obtain the correct form of P (x, t + ∆t), then, we must renormalize this distribution as:

If µ(x) = constant, i.e., for x-independent cell growth, the ﬁrst term in equation
(6), (µ(x(t))
¯µ(t))P (x, t), vanishes and accordingly equation (6) is reduced to just
the usual Fokker–Planck equation (2); the inﬂuence of the state-dependent cell-growth
appears only in the term (µ(x(t))
¯µ(t))P (x, t), which plays the role of source (sink)
in the distribution density, if the growth rate at some point x is greater (smaller) than
the mean growth rate, ¯µ. Equation (6) obtained above is nonlinear in P because the
term µ(t) involves P itself, so that it ﬁrst looks rather diﬃcult to analyze. Fortunately,
however, the analysis turns out not to be so diﬃcult, as will be shown in the next
section.

3. Analysis of the evolution equation of the distribution with growth

In this section, we examine the structure of equation (6), with the aid of linear operators
and eigenvalues. We ﬁrst introduce a linear operator

#

and rewrite equation (6) as

∂P (x, t)

=

¯µ(t)P (x, t) + L(x)P (x, t).

As the operator L is of the Sturm–Liouville type, we can, in principle, ﬁnd all of
its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions, and all the eigenvalues are real [18].
We denote the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions by λi and φi(x), where
the index i runs over the non-negative integers, i = 0, 1, 2, .., and the eigenvalues are
λj for i < j. From the deﬁnition, λi and φi(x) satisfy the relation
ordered so that λi ≥

L(x)φi(x) = λiφi(x).

In general, we can introduce the adjoint operator of L, denoted by L†, and introduce
the ”left” eigenfunctions of L† denoted by ψi(x), for the eigenvalue λi. As is well
known, left and right eigenfunctions for diﬀerent eigenvalues are orthogonal and can be

where the prime over the summation symbol indicates that the summation is taken over
all eigenfunctions except non-contributing ones.

Equation (16) tells us that any eigenfunction φi(x) of the linear operator L, except
for the non-contributing ones, gives a stationary solution of equation (6), because any

is a stationary solution of (14). Among those
stationary solutions, however, only the solution with aj(t) = δj,0, is stable.

To show this, we make a linear stability analysis of these solutions. Consider the
solution ai(t) = δik for given k, and introduce a perturbation δai(t) as ai(t) = δik +δai(t)
(i = 0, 1, ...,). Then, inserting this into (16) and retaining only the terms of ﬁrst order

The requirement λ0 > 0 for the stability of the system is quite reasonable.
Otherwise, all λj are negative, which means there is no growth at any state, and all
the cells would become extinct with time (recall that λi is equal to the growth rate
of the mode represented by the ith eigenfunction). To have a positive growth rate for
the stationary distribution, λ0 > 0 is therefore necessary. The condition λ0 > 0 simply
means that the cells (or units) continue reproduction without extinction.

Now, the stationary solution of equation (6) is given by φ0(x), the eigenfunction
of the operator L corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue λ0. Similarly to the case of
the standard Fokker–Planck equation, the eigenvalue problem of the operator L can be
transformed into that for the Schr¨odinger-type equation whose ”potential” is given by
the functions f (x), g(x), and µ(x) (see Appendix A). Hence we can use the methods
and solutions developed in quantum mechanics.

4. Two simple examples of the evolution of the distribution

In this section we study two simple examples of equation (6) by linear or threshold-type
dependence of the growth rate on x. We choose f (x) = kx and g(x) = D in equation (6)
with k and D positive constants; the reasons for this choice are: (i) that the Gaussian
distribution is often observed to be the stationary distribution of a biological state,
while this linear Langevin equation is the simplest to realize the Gaussian distribution
(the log-normal distribution is sometimes observed in cells [5, 9, 19], but in this case we
can simply use the logarithm of the quantity as the variable x that concerns us), and
(ii) that this linear Langevin equation has been thoroughly investigated in physics and

mathematics; it models the motion of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential, so
that we can easily see the eﬀect of the state-dependent growth introduced here.

Indeed, as long as the range of x in concern is small, gradual change in µ(x) can be
approximated by linear change.

Fortunately, however, in this case there is a more convenient way to obtain the
dynamics of the system:
if the system starts with a Gaussian distribution at some
initial time, the temporal evolution of the distribution preserves the Gaussian form. By

value and the variance, it can be shown (see Appendix B), that the temporal evolution
preserves the Gaussian form when the time evolution equations for α and β are given
by dα(t)

2kβ(t) + 2D.
dt = aβ(t)
These equations indicate that while the temporal evolution of the variance is
completely the same as the case for a constant µ, the evolution of the mean value
is inﬂuenced by the state-dependent growth; the mean value is shifted in the direction
of larger µ, driven by its variance. In the stationary state, as is also given in equation
(17), the mean value (peak position) shifts with the degree aD/k2 compared with the
case without the growth term (or, from the case with constant µ (i.e., a = 0)). Note
that this change in the mean value in the stationary state is proportional to the variance
of the original distribution, which is given by D/k, i.e.,

In other words, the larger the variance of the distribution is, the more the mean
value shifts. Correspondence with the ﬂuctuation–response relationship [20, 9]
is
interesting, because the shift in the growth is proportional to the original ﬂuctuation.
In addition, response to a higher growth state is possible only under the ﬂuctuation of

With this shift of ∆x, the average growth rate of a cell changes with

4.2. A threshold for growth: the step function µ(x)

We consider equation (6) with µ(x) = a, Θ(x

and Θ is the so-called Heaviside step function; Θ(x) = 0 for x < 0 and Θ(x) = 1 for
x
0. We study this case, because in biological systems, a threshold for reproduction
sometimes exists.

−

In this case, the eigenfunctions are written analytically with the use of conﬂuent
geometric series and the corresponding eigenvalues are obtained, by transforming the
equation to the Schr¨odinger equation (see Appendix A). Because the complete analytic
form is rather complicated, we discuss only the results of numerical calculations here.

First, we consider the stationary distribution of equation (6). When the position x0
D
of the step of µ(x) is within the standard deviation of Psingle(x), i.e., 0
k (we
consider only the case of non-negative x0), the stationary distribution gradually moves
toward the position x0, as the parameter a increases. On the other hand, when the
D
position x0 is outside the standard deviation of Psingle(x), i.e., x0 >
k , the stationary
distribution does not change much until the parameter a reaches some critical value
ac. As a increases beyond that value, the distribution shifts smoothly to larger x. The
existence of the critical value ac is demonstrated in ﬁgure (1), which is a plot of the
total amount of the distribution in the right region (x > x0) against the relative growth
rate a (see ﬁgure (2)).

characteristic time, that is the average time required for a cell in a higher-growth
state (x > x0) to change to the lower-growth state (x < x0). This numerical result
is reasonable: if the relative growth rate a is smaller than ac, cells change to the state
x < x0 before they grow suﬃciently in the higher-growth region x > x0. The cells
cannot ‘feel’ the higher-growth region, so that the diﬀerence in growth rates does not
inﬂuence the cell population distribution.

Next, we brieﬂy explain the dynamic behavior of the distribution when the relative
growth rate is greater than ac and the distribution is initially localized at x < x0. To be
speciﬁc, we set P (x, t0) = δ(x), i.e., localized at x = 0. The temporal evolution of the
distribution is given in ﬁgure (3). Here: (i) ﬁrst, the distribution behaves as if it does
not ‘feel’ the state-dependence of µ(x), until its tail touches x0, the edge of the step
function. (ii) After the tail of the distribution reaches the edge of the step function, the
distribution in this tail region starts to grow faster (see ﬁgure (3)); at this stage, the

On the Distribution of State Values of Reproducing Cells

distribution has two peaks. (iii) Finally, the distribution converges to a single peak at
the mean value at around x0, the position of the step of µ(x). This temporal evolution
to a higher growth state is in contrast to the linear case, where a single-peak distribution
is preserved and only the peak position is shifted.

In the present example, the stationary distribution has a single peak. For some
forms of f (x), however, the stationary distribution has two peaks, even though the
single cell distribution (without the x dependence of µ(x)) has a single peak. For
example, for f (x) = 2sgn(x) with the present form of µ(x), two peaks coexist (see ﬁgure
(4)). Here, for large x (x > x0(= 4)), the growth rate is high and the distribution is
conﬁned within some range, so that the distribution has one peak in that region, while
for small x (x < x0), not all cells grow so that the distribution of the cells tends to
decrease. However, many cells that have grown in the higher-growth region ﬂow into
the lower-growth region because of the eﬀect of the force of f , so that the distribution
has another peak there.

5. Conclusion and discussion

In the present paper we have posed the question of how the distribution of an
intracellular state variable (say the abundances of some chemical or degree of gene
expression) is altered due to the state dependence of the replication rate of a cell.
To discuss the temporal evolution of the distribution of the internal state x of
such replication units, we have incorporated the state-dependent growth rate into
the standard Fokker–Planck equation. By considering the population distribution of
replication units with Langevin equation dynamics, we have derived a general equation
for the temporal evolution of the distribution of states P (x, t). The derived equation
includes a self-consistent term arising from the growth rate. In spite of this non-linear
term, we can formally solve the equation as an eigenvalue problem of the Sturm–Liouville
type. Note that the formalism presented here is rather general, as is the Fokker–Planck
equation.

After giving a general analysis of the equation, we have studied two simple examples,
assuming the linear Langevin equation for single-cellular dynamics. First, when the
growth rate increases linearly with the state value x, the average of x over cells increases
in proportion to its variance, which reminds us of the ﬂuctuation-response relationship
in physics, while the proportion coeﬃcient is estimated by the increase of the growth
rate and the relaxation time. Note that the shift of population distribution to a higher
growth state is possible only with the ﬂuctuation of the internal state. Our result implies
that the response of x to environmental change is proportional to its variance. In other
words, ﬂuctuations in chemical concentration, which have been studied extensively, are
relevant to biological adaptation.

Now let us return to the question raised in the introduction. We measure an
, from an ensemble of cells, and study its change against
intracellular state variable
the change in external conditions. Here we change the environmental condition (e.g.,

x
i

h

nutrient concentration) and the cell state value x (e.g., the concentration of some
enzyme) is changed accordingly. After the cell distribution becomes stationary, we can
measure this change of the average x denoted by
itotal that is caused by the change
in the environmental condition. Now, from this measurement, we are often interested
in detecting the change in the stationary state of x, to explore intracellular dynamics.
However, such an intracellular state variable x is often also related with the ability

for cell growth. Hence

from equation (18). Here the latter term can be estimated from the standard
measurements. First, through equation (19), a can be estimated from the change in
the average growth rate of cells. Second, k is simply the relaxation time. Hence, by
measuring the temporal change of
, and by ﬁtting the approach to its stationary
value by an exponential form, one can estimate k. Finally, from the variance of the
state value x at a stationary state (by ﬂow cytometry or by other means), we can obtain
(δx)2
, so that the intracellular change

of x is estimated from the observable quantity

In our second example, we studied the case with a threshold-type dependence of
the growth rate on the state x. When the position x0 of the step of µ(x) is outside the
D
standard deviation of Psingle(x), i.e., when x0 >
k , the distribution does not change
signiﬁcantly until the relative growth rate a reaches a critical value ac, beyond which the
distribution starts to shift to the higher-growth region. From the biophysical viewpoint,
the value ac corresponds to the inverse of the average time required for a cell to change
from the higher-growth state (x > x0) to the lower-growth state(x < x0).

q

Here we have found that the distribution of the state variable often exhibits double
peaks over a long transient time. For some form of f (x) and µ(x), a double-peak
stationary distribution is also obtained, even if Psingle(x) has only a single peak. This
raises a cautious remark on the interpretation of the distribution observed in ﬂow
cytometry. Even if double peaks are observed, this does not necessarily mean that the
internal cell dynamics (e.g., gene expression network dynamics or metabolic dynamics)
have bistable states. One of the peaks may be associated with the ﬂow of population
due to the diﬀerence in reproduction speeds.

Several extensions of the present formulation are straightforward. Although we
mainly discussed the case with a single state variable, extension to a higher-dimensional
case is straightforward. Inclusion of a memory term to go beyond Markovian dynamics
will be possible, although we expect that most of the results on the linear and step-
function cases above are still valid in the non-Markovian case.

Although we have given our formulation here for a reproducing cell with an internal
state (e.g., chemical concentration), the present formulation can be applied generally

On the Distribution of State Values of Reproducing Cells

to any reproducing system with a growth rate dependent on its internal state. For
example, it can be applied to an artiﬁcial cell or a replicating biochemical system with
a growth rate that depends on its internal catalytic activity. Furthermore, application
to continuous evolution is possible. By taking x as a Hamming distance from a typical
gene, the evolution process to change x to a given phenotype having some function
can be considered. Here, the reproduction rate depends on x, which gives µ(x), while
the diﬀusion process in x is simply the mutation, with D as the mutation rate. As
non-functional mutants are more common, the mutation in the change of function (or
activity) has a drift to a smaller regime, leading to a ‘force’ term towards x = 0 as in
equation(1). The temporal evolution of the distribution of gene x is thus analyzed by
using our equation (6), while in some examples, the steady state with positive growth
rate collapses [10], with the increase of the mutation rate, as the largest growth speed
λ0 becomes negative, which leads to error catastrophe.

A biological unit reproduces at a rate that depends on its state. The present Fokker–
Planck equation with growth and death provides a basic equation for such problems in
general.

Appendix A. Transformation of the linear operator L to a Hermite operator

In this section we transform equation (6) to a type of Schr¨odinger equation, to show
explicitly that the operator L deﬁned by (8) is transformed to an Hermite operator.
Here we follow the standard transformation from the Fokker–Planck equation to the
Schr¨odinger equation [17], except for the existence of the terms concerning µ(x).

We ﬁrst introduce a new variable y deﬁned as y(x) =

g(x′) dx′, where x0 is some
number on [x1, x2]. According to this transformation, the distribution can change to
R
ˆP (y, t) = 1

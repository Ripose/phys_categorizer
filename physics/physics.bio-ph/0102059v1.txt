Abstract

The coherent dynamics of vibronic wave packets in the green ﬂuorescent pro-

tein is reported. At room temperature the non-stationary dynamics following

impulsive photoexcitation displays an oscillating optical transmissivity pat-

tern with components at 67 fs (497 cm−1) and 59 fs (593 cm−1). Our results

are complemented by ab initio calculations of the vibrational spectrum of

the chromophore. This analysis shows the interplay between the dynamics of

the aminoacidic structure and the electronic excitation in the primary optical

events of green ﬂuorescent proteins.

The green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) of the Aequorea victoria jellyﬁsh has emerged in

recent years as a unique ﬂuorescent label in several biological studies [1]. GFP is a large

intrinsically-ﬂuorescent protein (238 amino acids) characterized by a cylinder-shaped three-

dimensional structure with a diameter of 24 ˚A and a height of 42 ˚A [2]. The chromophore,

located at the center of the cylinder, is a photoexcitable green-light emitter autocatalytically

generated by the post-translational modiﬁcation of a 3-amino-acid sequence (Ser65-Tyr66-

Gly67) [3]. It consists of the hydroxybenzyl side chain of Tyr66 (phenolic ring) and the

imidazolidinone ring formed by cyclization of the tripeptide (heterocyclic ring). The spectral

characteristics of its emission and absorption bands have received a tremendous amount of

attention [2–5] in an eﬀort to understand GFP photophysics down to the single-molecule

level [6] and design mutants with optical properties tailored to speciﬁc needs. To date there

exists a large set of GFP mutants with absorption and emission bands ranging from the violet

to the red part of the spectrum. Recently time-dependent analyses have shed light on internal

photoconversion mechanisms [7,8]. However, a deﬁnitive microscopic model accounting for

the optical properties of the chromophore and its blinking and photobleaching dynamics

[5–7] is still missing, partly due to a lack of precise information on the electronic states

involved and to the limited eﬀort in theoretical modelling. Only in recent years, in fact, a

few electronic-structure calculations of the GFP chromophore in diﬀerent protonation states

have been performed [9,10].

Few-optical-cycle laser pulses allow ultrafast spectroscopy with unprecedented temporal

resolution and are opening new avenues in the study of optical properties of molecules

[11]. Creation of non-stationary vibronic wave packets and their observation have already

provided new insights into the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the optical activity

of few simple physical and biophysical systems [12–15]. Observation of coherent phenomena

in a protein, however, still remains a challenge because of fast dephasing times. There exist

only few reports on coherent dynamics in proteic systems whose functionality, however, is

determined by non-proteic cofactors [14,15].

In this Letter we demonstrate that GFP ultrafast response after femtosecond laser ex-

2

citation is dominated by the coherent dynamics of single-electron vibronic wave packets,

created in both the ground and excited states of the protein chromophore [16]. The coher-

ent dynamics manifests as an oscillatory modulation of the diﬀerential optical transmissivity.

These results provide direct measurements of the chromophore collective vibrations during

the optical process. In order to elucidate this dynamics, we also report the ﬁrst ab initio

calculations of the vibrational properties of the GFP chromophore based on the density

functional theory (DFT).

The time-resolved technique here reported employed a pump-probe experimental scheme

[13] with identical pump and probe pulses, resonant with GFP absorption. Sub-10 fs pulses

centered around 500 nm were generated using a non-collinear optical parametric ampliﬁer

in the visible, pumped by the second harmonic of a Ti:sapphire laser [17]. The pulses had

energies of about 40 nJ and spectral width allowing analysis in a broad wavelength range

(490-550 nm). Samples consisted of GFP solutions at a concentration of 350 µM in volumes

of 40 µl kept in a 0.5 mm-thick cuvette. Additionally, room-temperature steady-state ab-

sorption and emission spectra were measured. In particular, absorption was measured in a

300 µl GFP sample at a concentration of 70 µM in a 1 cm-long cuvette. For these experi-

ments we selected a representative GFP mutant, the enhanced GFP (EGFP), exhibiting a

single absorption peak around 490 nm (associated to the anionic form of the chromophore

[18]) and improved brightness after blue-light excitation with respect to wild-type GFP [5].

Figure 1 shows the steady-state absorption (dotted line) and emission (solid line) spectra

of EGFP together with a schematic conﬁguration-coordinate diagram for the anionic state.

The absorption peak at 490 nm corresponds to the vertical electronic transition labeled as

A. The emission lineshape displays two bands associated to transitions (B and C in the

diagram) from the bottom of the excited state band into the ﬁrst two vibrational levels of

the ground state. The lower panel of Fig. 1 shows the wavelength dependence of the average

EGFP diﬀerential transmissivity (∆T/T) in the very ﬁrst picoseconds following impulsive

excitation. The observed positive values at the absorption and emission maxima can be

assigned to ground-state absorption bleaching and stimulated emission from the excited

3

state.

In the inset of the lower panel of Fig. 1, a typical time trace with low sampling

frequency of ∆T/T (at 500 nm) is reported. The signal remains constant during the ﬁrst

tens of picoseconds in agreement with expected values of ﬂuorescence lifetime (≈3.3 ns [8]).

Superimposed to the long-lasting value of the EGFP transmissivity we detected sub-

picosecond oscillations during the ﬁrst two picoseconds following excitation. In Fig. 2 (left

side) a representative time-dependent ∆T/T at 530 nm is reported. Similar modulations

were observed at other wavelengths. This oscillation pattern is a direct evidence of coher-

ent dynamics of electronic wave packets in the GFP chromophore and yields two distinct

frequencies at 497 cm−1 (period 67 fs) and 593 cm−1 (period 59 fs) with dephasing time

of about 1 ps. The two peaks in the power spectrum shown in the inset of the ﬁgure are

clearly distinguishable and were found at unaltered position for the wavelengths studied.

The measured frequencies correspond to the energy spacing between consecutive vibronic

levels of the chromophore in the ground and excited states. In our case, for pump-pulse du-

ration signiﬁcantly shorter than the oscillation period, we expect the oscillatory signal to be

dominated by excited-state dynamics, since the wave packet does not move greatly from the

Franck-Condon region during excitation [19]. The ground-state vibrational frequency can

also be roughly extracted from the energy spacing between bands B and C in the emission

lineshape shown in Fig. 1. This procedure gives a value of ≈660 cm−1.

However, in order to unambiguously establish that the dominant mode (at 497 cm−1)

corresponds to the GFP dynamics in the excited state, we considered the spectral depen-

dence of the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory pattern [15]. The coherent oscillation

of a vibronic wave packet in the excited state, in fact, causes periodic wavelength shifts in

stimulated emission. This should yield periodic changes in the intensity of the stimulated

emission with maxima where the slope of the emission lineshape is large (at 500 and 530

nm, see Fig. 1) and minima at the peak position and wings of the emission spectrum. In ad-

dition, the oscillatory pattern at wavelengths corresponding to the two sides of the emission

peak must be out of phase. Similar arguments relate the vibronic wave packet in the ground

state and absorption modulation to the absorption lineshape. The right side of Fig. 2 shows

4

the amplitude (upper panel) and the relative phase (lower panel) of the measured trans-

missivity oscillations as a function of wavelength. This analysis reveals weak oscillations at

wavelengths near the emission peak and at the wings, while larger on the steep sides. A

strong phase change (approximately a phase inversion) centered around the wavelength of

the emission maximum is observed. These data conﬁrm that the origin of the dominant

modulation at 497 cm−1 is the vibrational dynamics in the excited state. We associate the

other frequency to oscillations in the ground state in light of the results of the steady-state

emission lineshape analysis and of our model-chromophore calculations (see below).

On the basis of these arguments, we are now able to elucidate the vibrational pattern

driven by the optical excitation process and identify the coupling mechanism of the vibra-

tional motion to the electronic excitation. To this end we performed electronic, structural,

and vibrational calculations of the isolated EGFP chromophore in the anionic state within

a DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics approach [20]. The electronic structure was

calculated by using a local density exchange and correlation functional with Becke and

Perdew gradient corrections [21]. Soft ﬁrst-principle pseudopotential [22] were used for the

interactions between valence electrons and inner cores with a 25 Ryd energy cutoﬀ for the

plane-wave basis set. Simulations with 0.15 fs time-step were performed in a 15 ˚A cubic

box, large enough to prevent interactions with the periodic images.

In the top part of Fig. 3 we show the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and

LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) of the chromophore. A charge transfer from

the phenolic ring to the heterocyclic ring and a redistribution of the charge within each

ring following electronic excitation is observed. This charge transfer is responsible for an

increase of the proton aﬃnity of the Tyr66 heterocyclic-ring nitrogen and may be linked to

the blinking dynamics [9,23].

The charge redistribution also causes changes in the strengths of some of the molec-

ular bonds owing to the diﬀerence in bonding character between the ground and excited

electronic states. This stimulates the dynamics seen in our experiments. The ground-state

vibrational spectrum was calculated at T=300 K from the Fourier-transform of the veloc-

5

ity autocorrelation function on a ≈1.5 ps trajectory of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics.

The resulting spectrum is shown in the lower part of Fig. 3 (dashed line). The vibrational

frequencies in the region above 1000 cm−1 agree within 5% with recent Raman data on the

EGFP chromophore [24] and correspond to (localized or collective) stretching modes [23].

However, in thermally-equilibrated conditions not all the modes associated to the optical

excitation have a signiﬁcant spectral strength. We note that these modes are very unlikely

to be observed in steady-state resonant Raman experiments owing to ﬂuorescence or sample

degradation [24] but are accessible within our experimental approach. In order to specif-

ically enhance these modes, we performed runs in appropriate non-thermally-equilibrated

conditions reproducing the atomic displacements induced by the electronic excitation [23].

The corresponding spectrum is shown in Fig. 3 (solid line). As expected, this simulation al-

lows us to better identify the high-frequency streching modes in the range 1000-1650 cm−1.

Remarkably, the same simulation also yields vibrations below 800 cm−1 corresponding to an-

gular deformations of the chromophore. This fact provides evidence of intramolecular mode

coupling among vibrations in two diﬀerent and characteristic frequency ranges [25]. The

inset of Fig. 3 reports an enlarged view in the low-frequency region of the solid-line spectrum

shown in the main panel. The arrow indicates the experimentally-measured ground-state

frequency (593 cm−1). At frequencies close to this one, we found two modes at 575 and 615

cm−1. The identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc one corresponding to the experiment is beyond our

accuracy. However they both correspond to collective vibrations involving angular in-plane

deformation of the rings (mainly the phenolic one) and of the bridge between them. We can

therefore draw unambiguous conclusions on the relevant microscopic processes involved.

The steps leading to the coupling of these low-frequency modes to the electronic pho-

toexcitation can now be easily understood: in structures with a π-bonding system, the high-

frequency stretching modes are usually directly coupled to the electronic excitation, since

the primary eﬀect of the induced electronic-density change is to shorten the single bonds and

lengthen the double bonds (for example in retinals [26]). The double-ring structure of the

GFP chromophore, however, introduces a strong geometric constraint that allows eﬃcient

6

coupling to the low-frequency angular modes responsible for the observed coherent dynam-

ics. This process highlights the intramolecular coupling pathways and nuclear dynamics

following photoexcitation and is a peculiar photophysical property of the GFP family.

In conclusion, we presented the coherent dynamics of single-electron vibronic wave pack-

ets following ultrafast excitation in EGFP. The analysis of coherent oscillations provided

the vibrational frequencies of both the ground and excited states of the EGFP chromophore

and allowed to evaluate the wave-packet dephasing time. The collective vibration excited

during the optical process and its coupling mechanism to the electronic excitation have been

identiﬁed by ab initio calculations.

Abstract

Electrical pacing is a common procedure that is used in both experimental and clinical settings for

studying and/or annihilating anatomical reentry. In a recent study [Comtois and Vinet, Chaos 12,

903 (2002)], new ways to terminate the one-dimensional reentry using a simple protocol consisting

of only two stimulations were discovered. The probability of annihilating the reentrant activity is

much more probable by these new scenarios than by the usual local unidirectional block. This paper

is an extension of the previous study in which the sensitivity of the new scenarios of annihilation

to the pathway length is studied. It follows that reentry can be stopped over a limited interval of

the pathway length and that increasing the length beyond the upper limit of this interval yields to

a transition to sustained double-wave reentry. A similar dynamical mechanism, labeled alternans

ampliﬁcation, is found to be responsible for both behaviors.

INTRODUCTION

The picture of a ﬁxed waveform traveling at constant speed around a ring of excitable

tissue, is still a common representation of functional reentry in the clinical setting, particu-

larly in reference to common atrial ﬂutter [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. However, the ﬁndings that complex

reentries are possible even in a simple homogeneous one-dimensional ionic loop model and

that their occurrence is dependent on the steepness of the restitution curve of the action

potential duration has altered the current understanding of the phenomena [6, 7, 8, 9], in

which reentry was postulated to remain stable and periodic as long as there was a minimal

excitable gap ahead of the wavefront. These ﬁndings have also altered the thinking about

the eﬀect of antiarrhythmic drugs. [10, 11].

Overdrive pacing using a transvenously inserted catheter in the right atrium is a standard

clinical procedure to interrupt atrial ﬂutter.

It is very successful, particularly when it is

applied in conjunction with the administration of class I or III antiarrhythmic drug [12, 13]

The use of rapid pacing is likely to increase with the implant of permanent single or dual site

stimulator for the prevention of atrial tachycardias[14]. However, the mechanism by which

overdrive pacing interrupts reentry and the electrophysiological parameters of the reentry

circuit that may determined an optimal choice of parameters for the pacing protocol are not

As a ﬁrst step to improve the pacing algorithm, we have previously studied of a simple

protocol of stimulation consisting of two electrical stimuli applied in the pathway of a periodic

reentry [15]. New scenarios of reentry annihilation were identiﬁed, diﬀerent from the classical

unidirectional block [16, 17, 18], which is still considered to be the most important mode of

understood.

termination.

These alternative scenarios of reentry annihilation follow from a spatiotemporal process

that we have called alternans ampliﬁcation [15]. The ﬁrst objective of this paper is to

understand the eﬀect of length of the reentry pathway on these scenarios of annihilation.

We also show that beyond a critical length of the reentry pathway, alternans ampliﬁcation

induces a transition double-wave reentry instead of annihilation.

II. MODELS AND METHODS

Results obtained with two diﬀerent models are presented. The ﬁrst model (ionic loop:

IL) is a one-dimensional reaction diﬀusion system, using a cardiac ionic model to represent

the transmembrane currents. The second model is an integral-delay equation (ID) based on

the local properties of propagation and repolarization.

A.

Ionic loop model

The well-known monodomain cable equation for an 1D homogeneous excitable cardiac

tissue embedded in an unbounded external medium of negligible resistivity is:

∂x2 = S

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

,

(1)

where V is the transmembrane potential (mV), Cm is the membrane capacitance (1 µFcm−2),
S the surface-to-volume ratio (0.4 µm−1, assuming cylindrical cells with radius of 5 µm) and

ρ is the intracellular resistivity (200 Ωcm). Iion is given by a modiﬁed version of the Beeler-

Reuter model (MBR) of the cardiac cell membrane, whose details and space-clamp dynamics

are given in [19].

For each time step (∆t = 2µs), the system becomes a second order ordinary diﬀerential

equation that is computed with a Galerkin ﬁnite element method projected on a linear basis

function and a regular spatial mesh (∆x = 50 µm)[7]. The resulting tridiagonal linear

system of equations is solved with a simpliﬁed LU decomposition method. The choice of

∆t and ∆x is motivated by the fact that depolarization is the stiﬀest part of the process.

Programs were written in Fortran77 and ran on SGI workstations (Silicon Graphics).

Following the generation of an action potential, two quantities are measured at each site

to analyze the propagation: the activation time (Tact(x)) and repolarization time (Trep(x)).

Tact(x) corresponds to the onset of the action potential and is deﬁned as the moment at which

dV /dt reaches its maximum during the upstroke of the action potential. Trep(x) is meant

to indicate the time from which a new action potential can be generated by an incoming

activation front or an external stimulus. A large set of simulations of sustained reentry in

loops of diﬀerent lengths has showed that an active propagating response was generated if

3

stimulation was applied at least 30 ms after the −50 mV post-upstroke downcrossing in

repolarization. Accordingly, this instant (i.e. 30 ms after −50 mV crossing) is taken as

Trep(x). The action potential (A (x)) is deﬁned as the time interval from Tact(x) to Trep(x),

such that Trep(x) = Tact(x) + A(x). The diastolic interval (D (x)) associated to an activation

occurring at Tact(x) is deﬁned as the time between the previous Trep(x) and current Tact(x).

With these deﬁnitions, a site is excitable if D (x) ≥ 0.

B.

Integral-delay model

The integral-delay model used in this study is an extension of a previous formulation that

was developed to describe sustained unidirectional propagation on the loop [9, 15, 20, 21].

A ﬁrst relation ASP (D) gives the duration of the action potential as a function of D in

the space-clamped conﬁguration. If the nodes were disconnected from their neighbors, the

repolarization time following an activation occurring at Tact(x) would be:

rep (x) = Tact (x) + ASP (D (x))
T SP

provided that D ≥ 0. If D < 0, the node is unexcitable. The actual repolarization time

of a node at position x is expressed as a weighted average of T SP

rep (x) over a symmetric

neighborhood of length 2α, i.e.:

Trep (x) =

w (u) T SP

rep (x + u) du

α

−α

Z

where , w (x) = ϑ−1 exp (−βx2) with (ϑ = 0.5, β = 800 cm−2, α = 0.5 cm), is the weighting

function representing the eﬀect of resistive coupling on the repolarization phase. β controls

the spatial decay of the weighting function and ϑ is a normalization coeﬃcient such that

α
−α w (u) du = 1. The calculation of Trep associated to one excitation is performed at
each node at the next instance when it is stimulated by an incoming front or an external
R
stimulus. At this moment, the T SP

rep associated to the previous excitation of each point of

the neighborhood are collected and averaged to produce Trep. In this way, a front whose

propagation stops at some location still produces a continuous distribution of Trep around
the region of block since Trep is an weighted average of the T SP
rep

of the sites excited by

the front that is blocked and of those that were not reached by that front and still have

the T SP

rep (x) associated to their previous excitation. It provides at once a representation of

4

the acceleration of repolarization of the excited cells induced by the load of those that are

not excited, and of the prolongation of repolarization in those that were not excited by the

electrotonic depolarization induces by the proximal excited cells.

Once the Trep associated to the last excitation that we label T last

rep (x), has been computed,
the diastolic interval associated to the current stimulation, which take place at the time

Tact(x), is calculated as:

D (x) = Tact (x) − T last

rep (x)

(2)

If D ≥ 0,the stimulus produces an action potential, which propagates on both side with a

conduction time ct(D(x)), and reached the neighbouring nodes at the time Tact (x ± ∆x) =
Tact (x) + ∆x ct(D(x)). If D < 0, the point is not activated, and its T SP

rep (x) is not changed.

The integral-delay model was originally developed to represent the propagation of a

single activation front during reentry, without external stimulation. In this context, T last

rep (x)
is always the repolarisation associated to the previous passage of the activation front and it

w (u) is taken as a δ function, which is equivalent to ignoring the eﬀect of coupling, eq. 2

corresponds to the version of the integral-delay model of Courtemanche and al.

with A0 = 225.22 ms, B0 = 105.74 ms, τ = 94.71 ms, and F = 59.38 ms [9, 15]. These

functions were obtained by ﬁtting the data gathered from diﬀerent regimes of propagation

(free running periodic and QP reentry obtained with the IL model)[9]. Computations were

performed with a spatial discretization of ∆x = 50 µm, as in the ionic model.

C. Protocol of stimulation

For the IL model, Istim consists of a 2.5 ms current pulse applied over an interval of 450

µm with amplitude of 60 µA/cm2. Dual stimulations were applied on periodic reentry. The

timing of stimuli was controlled by two parameters: ∆F −S1, the time interval between the

last activation at the center of the stimulated area and the onset of the ﬁrst stimulus S1;

∆S1−S2 , the time interval between the onset of S1 and that of the second stimulus S2

For the ID model, the value of D, deﬁnes the response of the nodes that are stimulated.

If D < 0, the stimulus is applied in the refractory period and doest not have an eﬀect.

If D ≥ 0, the stimulus depolarizes the tissue, deﬁning ASP (D), and induces bi-directional

propagation. As for the IL model the stimulation covers 450 µm.

III. RESULTS

The post-stimuli dynamics are constrained by the steady states of the system. For loops

longer than a minimum length Lmin, sustained reentries are stable attractor of the system.

These sustained reentries can be either periodic (period-1) or quasiperiodic (QP), and hold a

single (SW), two (DW) or more traveling activation fronts. Table I lists the stable solutions

of both the ID and IL models for L < 3Lmin. The number and nature of the sustained

reentries change with L and condition the outcomes of the stimulations.

QP reentries are characterized by a spatial oscillation of D, with a wavelength Λ that

is an irrational fraction of L (ﬁg. 1A and C). For both SW and DW reentries, there is an

interval of L in which two diﬀerent QP solutions coexist. These solutions, labeled mode-0

and mode-1, have a similar structure but Λmode-0 ≈ 3Λmode-1. In SW reentries, the passage of

each activation front is associated with a proﬁle of A and D holding one (mode-0, panel A)

or multiple (mode-1, panel C) maxima and minima over two turns. For DW QP reentries,

L is twice the value for SW QP reentries,

such that mode-0 has one maximum and one

minimum over one turn. (ﬁg. 1A). Successive activations at each site alternate between long

and short A and D values, except at a number of nodes corresponding to the boundaries

from which the phase of the alternation is inverted. As illustrated by the time-course of

Tact(x) and Trep(x)(ﬁg. 1, right panels), the quasi-periodic nature of the propagation makes

the position of the extrema and of the nodes to drift slowly in the direction inverse to the

propagation of the activation fronts. QP reentry is thus constituted by discordant alternans

[22, 23, 24] with boundaries between short and long APD moving around the loop.

Period-1 SW reentry can be annihilated by an isolated stimulus applied in the narrow

vulnerable window in which the stimulation produces only a retrograde front, corresponding

to the well-known mechanism of unidirectional block [17, 18, 25].

In a previous paper,

we have also described other modes of annihilation as well as diﬀerent transient dynamics

that were induced by two successive stimuli [15]. These new modes of annihilation were

compatible with experimental observations, and relevant to antiarrhythmic pacing therapy

[26]. However, that study was restricted to a speciﬁc length of the loop (Lcrit < L = 25 cm

< 2Lmin). In the following, we present a systematic investigation of the outcomes of double

A. Functional heterogeneity of refractoriness

Complex dynamics can be induced by a second stimulus S2 thanks to the asymmetric

proﬁle in Trep(x) left by the interaction of ﬁrst stimulus S1 with the reentry activation

front F . When ∆F −S1, the time between the last passage of F and the onset of S1, is

beyond the vulnerable window, S1 produces both a retrograde (R1) and an antegrade (A1)

activation front. As illustrated in ﬁg. 2A, the key factor determining the dynamics that

can be induced by S2 is the region located between the site of stimulation (xS) and the

site of the collision between F and R1 (xc, identiﬁed by the arrow in 2A). Trep (thin line

in ﬁg. 2A) is minimum near xS and reaches its maximum at xc. The IL and ID models

produce the same proﬁle of Trep(x) (thin lines and triangles, respectively, in 2A), showing

that the ID model that was initially developed to describe sustained reentry also provides an

appropriate low-dimensional representation of the dynamics when stimulations are applied.

The location of xc as well as the proﬁle of Trep(x) around xS depend on both ∆F −S1 and L.

Figure 2B shows the proﬁle of Trep(x) obtained from loops of diﬀerent lengths stimulated

at the same diastolic interval DS1(xs) = ∆F −S1(L) − AF (L), where AF (L) is the action

potential duration of the stable reentry for each L. The position of xc is shifted to the left

(arrows in 2B) because the collision is delayed on longer loops. However all the loops have

the same invariant proﬁle of Trep in the time and space interval that they share before the

collision. If S1 is applied at larger DS1 value, the distance between xS and xc is shortened,

A(xS) and Trep(xS) are increased, such that the extent and depth of the cusp in Trep around

xS are diminished.

B.

Initiating a second antegrade propagation

The spatial proﬁle of Trep for short ∆F −S1 is asymmetrical, with a sharp gradient between

xS and xC, and a more gradual increase at the right of xS. Owing to this asymmetry, the

outcome of S2 depends on ∆S1−S2, the time interval between the onset of the two stimuli.

Figure 3 illustrates a case in which S2 is applied after the collision of F and R1, at an

instant where A1, the antegrade front created by S1, still has not reached xc. S2 creates

both an antegrade (A2) and a retrograde (R2) front, but R2 is blocked between xS and xc.

FIG. 3: IL model, on a loop of 23 cm: S2 creates both an antegrade (A2) and a retrograde front

R2.R2 is blocked between xS and xc shortly after its creation in the refractory tail left by the

retrograde front R1produces by S1.

Thereupon, the system is left with two antegrade fronts (A1 and A2). This occurs as long

as R2 does not propagate beyond xc to collide with A1, in which case A2 is left alone to

perpetuate the reentry. This is an alternate scenario of unidirectional block that creates a

propagating wave in the same direction as F and A1.

All the complex dynamics occur in the range of ∆S1−S2 for which R2 is blocked between xS

and xc whereas A2 propagates. This depends on the proﬁle of Trep (x) left by S1, which was

shown to be an invariant function of DS1 in ﬁg. 2B. Figure 4 shows the global characteristics

of the dynamics in the [DS1,∆S1−S2 ] parameters plane for two values of L (L = 25cm < 2Lmin

and 2Lmode-1
min < L = 34 cm < 2Lcrit). The parameter plane can be divided in three areas.
In the region labeled ∅ at low ∆S1−S2 values, S2 is applied during the refractory period and

does not produce a response. In the upper region, labeled ”R2 →”, R2 propagates beyond

xc, collides with A1, and A2 is left alone to maintain the reentry. In the middle area, R2

is blocked between xc and xsand complex dynamics may occur. The phase plane area in

11

which R2 is blocked, for DS1, between 0 and ∼ 50 ms (dotted vertical line), is the same for

the two L. The speciﬁc subsets in which complex dynamics occurs (represented by diﬀerent

shaded areas in ﬁg. 4) change with L, and are discussed later.

The article is focused on the area where R2 is blocked, between DS1 = 0 and ≈ 50 ms. The

lower limit of the area coincides with A (DS1) and is close to the action potential duration
restitution curve ASP (D). The upper limit is nearly a constant, around ∆S1−S2,max ≈ 204

ms. Appendix A shows that this ∆S1−S2 upper limit is set by the locus between xs and xc

where |dTrep (x) /dx| is equal to the maximum conduction time. This locus, indicated by

a circle for the speciﬁc DS1 illustrated in 2B, does not depend on L, which explains why

the upper limit for the block of R2 is identical in the two loops.

|dTrep (x) /dx| remains

everywhere below the maximum conduction time if DS1 is too long, explaining why the area

of complex dynamics disappears beyond DS1 ≈ 50 ms. It is also demonstrated in Appendix

A that the maximum slope of the ASP (D) function must be greater than ∼ 1 to allow the

block of R2. The same condition that controls the stability of the period-1 reentry [20, 21, 27]

thus determines if complex dynamics can be induced by S2.

C.

Interactions between the two antegrade propagating fronts

Once A2 has started to propagate and R2 has been blocked, there are 4 possible outcomes:

1) A1 is blocked and A2 perpetuates the SW reentry,

2) A2 is blocked, and A1 maintains the SW reentry,

3) A1 and A2 are blocked, and reentry is annihilated

4) neither A1 nor A2 are blocked, and there is a transition to DW reentry. As seen in

table I, this last option can only occur if L ≥ 2Lmin.

The next section discusses the cases 3) and 4) in which the system does not return to the

original SW period-1 reentry.

1. Reentry annihilation by alternans ampliﬁcation (A1 and A2 are blocked)

The three new scenarios of reentry annihilation reported in [15] are shown in ﬁg. 5. These

scenarios of termination diﬀer in the number of revolution made by the A1 and A2activation

fronts before they are blocked. Accordingly, we introduce the notation Am

that the front Ai = {1, 2} is blocked (⊣) after m turns around the loop. Let consider the

simplest case ([A1

1 ⊣, A1

2 ⊣], ﬁg. 5A) in which both A1 and A2 are blocked after one rotation.

A1 is blocked ﬁrst near xS, when it reaches the refractory tail left by A2 and R2. This

occurs because A1 has already completed a fraction of its rotation when S2 is applied. As

a consequence, A1 comes back to reactivate the sites near xS after a time interval much

shorter than the period of rotation T of the stable reentry. The block of A2 takes place

between xc and the site where R2 was blocked. When A1 travels in this zone, the region

has last been excited by R1, and a time interval longer than T has elapsed since this last

excitation. Besides, both the action potential and Trep associated to R1 were short since

S1 was premature. As a consequence, A1 produces action potentials that are longer than

those of the stable reentry. Since the time between the passage of A1 and the return of

13

A2 is also shorter than T , A2 is blocked. The block of A2 thus results from a process of

ampliﬁed alternation in a region between xS and xc. The premature R1 that creates short

action potential is followed by the late A1 generating long action potential.

In the two other scenarios, A1 nor A2 are blocked after either 2 or 3 turns ([A2
1 ⊣, A3

2 ⊣],
2 ⊣] in ﬁg. 5B-C). Each passage of A1 leaves around xS a convex proﬁle of Trep,

1 ⊣, A2

[A3

which is turned to a concave proﬁle by the subsequent passage of A2. The panel B and C

illustrates the process of alternans ampliﬁcation. Alternans ampliﬁcation may end up by

the blockade of one of the front, in which case propagation reverts to SW reentry. It may

saturated, leading to DW reentry, or may lead to annihilation. The next section explores

the conditions for annihilation.

stable period-1 SW reentry, to the limiting L ≈ 30.5 cm value. At short L (L = 20.5 cm, ﬁg.

and a small adjacent area of [A2

Appendix B provides the conditions needed for A1 to block in the tail of A2 and proves

that there is a limiting L beyond which this cannot happen. To summarize: 1) Increasing

∆S1−S2 produces longer action potential for S2, delays Trep(xS), and thus augments the

likelihood of A1 to be blocked. 2) However, the increase of ∆S1−S2 and Trep(xS) are bounded

by the condition of R2 being blocked between xS and xc, and these limiting values are

independent of L. 3) Since increasing L delays the return of A1, there is a length L from

which the return of A1 always occurs after the limiting Trep(xS) value.

respectively located at low and high DS1. As seen in ﬁg 6D, the zones of [A2,3
remain located at large DS1 even at values of L for which [A1

2 ⊣] does not exists

1 ⊣, A2,3

2 ⊣]

anymore. However, enlarging L also leads to the appearance and extension of areas in

which A1 and A2 persist together for an increasing number of turns before one of the front

is blocked (up to 7 activations in 6D). As L is increased, the areas of the parameters plane

associated to these other forms of transient complex dynamics extend toward low DS1, to

ﬁnally cover all the range from DS1 = 0 to 50 ms when L = 37.5 cm, a value close to 2Lcrit

from which DW reentry becomes possible. The areas of the parameters plane associated

to these behaviors with coexistence of A1 and A2 for multiple turns form a sequence of

contiguous parallel tongues.

All the higher modes of block and complex dynamics require that both A1 and A2 travel

beyond xs, at least at their ﬁrst return. Conditions for the block of A2 are derived in
Appendix C based on an approximation using the ASP (D) equation and rules for A1 and

A2 return cycles. It shows that the block of A2 depends on the balance between the return

cycle of A1 and A2.

2. Transition to double-wave reentry (neither A1 nor A2 is blocked)

In both the ID and IL model, annihilation by alternans ampliﬁcation is impossible from

L ≥ 30.5 cm.

In fact, for 31 > L ≥ 30.5 cm, only transient complex dynamics with a

ﬁnal return to period-1 SW reentry are observed. However, the maximum number of turns

with A1 and A2 co-traveling grows, just as the number of tongues in the [DS1, ∆S1−S2 ]

plane associated to diﬀerent numbers of turns during which the two fronts coexist. Each

new tongue appears at low DS1 and ∆S1−S2 values, and expands as L is further increased.

Finally, a ﬁrst transition to QP mode-0 DW reentry is detected at L = 31 cm (ﬁg. 7A).

Transition to DW reentry thus appears as the asymptotic limit of the prolongation of the

transient propagation with two fronts. However, transition to DW reentry begins much

beyond L = 2Lmin = 25.6 cm, the value at which sustained mode-0 QP DW reentry starts

to exist. In fact, at L = 31 cm, the system is rather in the range of L for which both DW

mode-0 and mode-1 solutions coexists.

For longer L, (ﬁg. 7B) the region with transition to mode-0 DW reentry expands, as

it was the case for all the zones associated to two fronts transient propagation created at

16

shorter L. Transition to mode-1 DW reentry also appears. However, the transition to

mode-1 appears at low DS1, but at two disjoint intermediate ∆S1−S2 values, giving rise to

two separated areas.

For still longer L, the areas of mode-0 and mode-1 transition enlarge until covering, from

L = 37.5 cm, all the area where R2 is blocked. Hence, from this value of L,transition to

DW reentry occurs in all instances where R2 is blocked. Finally, beyond 2Lcrit = 39 cm, all

transitions go to period-1 DW reentry, which is the only DW solution that remains.

3. Selecting the mode of QP reentry

Increasing the length of the pathway correlates with an increase in the complexity of

the dynamics and to the transition to sustained DW reentry. The results presented in ﬁg.

7 show that changing the timing of the stimuli when 2Lmin < L < 2Lcrit can induce the

transition either to the mode-0 or mode-1 DW QP reentry. The IL model was simulated with

L = 37.5 cm (2Lmin ≤ L < 2Lcrit but near 2Lcrit) to circumscribe the basin of attraction

in the parameter space associated to each DW QP reentry. The large area in which two

antegrade fronts are created (DS1 < 50 ms) is separated between two regions, with lower

∆S1−S2 converging to mode-0, and higher ∆S1−S2 to mode-1. In this last section, we compare

the transient dynamics leading to each of two modes of DW QP reentry.

Figure 8 shows the spatial proﬁle of D associated to A1 and A2 for two cases converging

respectively to mode-0 (panel A) and mode-1(panel B). In this representation, the passage

of A2 (DA2 (z), dotted line) at each location is followed by that of A1 (DA1 (z) ,full line).

At ﬁrst, A2 propagates with a short D, producing brief action potentials everywhere along

the loop. As a consequence, A1 travelling afterwards meets long D (z). DA1 (z) has its ﬁrst

maximum (P1) when it travels between xc and the point where R2was blocked, such that

DA2 has a minimum at the same location from which it increases slowly until its next return

in the same region. From there, DA2 (z) starts to alternate between long and short values

with a spatial period close to 2 turns, and DA1 (z) follows a complementary proﬁle. This ﬁrst

phase of the propagation, lasting for approximately 8 turns, can be labeled as concordant

alternans since DA2 and DA1 have alternating values and that each remains short or long

for at least one complete rotation. This pattern does not correspond neither to mode-0 nor

mode-1, since both stabilized DW QP solutions have a wavelength less than L.

17

However, from the beginning (k = 1, 2), DA1 already shows a second spatial oscillation

in D that is superimposed to the concordant alternans. The structure of this oscillation,

which has a wavelength close to one turn, makes the diﬀerence between the cases converging

to mode-0 and mode-1. In the former case, the oscillation embeds two peaks {P1, P2} (DA1

for mode-0, continuous line in ﬁg. 8A), while in the later case, it has three peaks {P1,

P2, P3} (DA1 for mode-1, continuous line in ﬁg. 8B). These superimposed spatial variations

persist while the concordant alternans dissipate. During this process, the position of the

peaks does not change much. As the amplitude of the concordant alternans decreases, the

respective height of the discordant alternans increases up to a point where the boundary

with large gradient in D begins to move around the loop due to the quasiperiodic nature of

the propagation. This travelling mechanism is akin to the propagation of paced discordant

alternans on a cable of cardiac tissue[22, 23, 24].

The main diﬀerence between the transition to mode-0 and mode-1 is the presence of

the third peak P3 in DA1. The P3 peak of DA1 is induced by the increase of ∆S1−S2. On

one hand, a larger ∆S1−S2 produces a longer Trep such that A1 meets a lower D and the

amplitude of P1 is reduced. But a larger ∆S1−S2 also implies that A2 travels faster, comes

back sooner to the stimulation sites, and set the stage for a new maximum in the DA1 proﬁle.

Of course the transition from two to three peaks is continuous process since a similar

variation of D with less amplitude already exists with the transition to mode-0 in ﬁg. 8A.

It means that there must be a minimal spatial proﬁle that corresponds to the boundary

between the two basins of attraction (the transition to either mode-0 or mode-1).

IV. DISCUSSION

Alternans ampliﬁcation, leading either to reentry annihilation or transition to DW reen-

try, can exist if the slope of the APD restitution curve is larger than one. Hence, the

condition on the slope of the APD restitution curve that is mandatory for the existence of

sustained QP reentry[21] also enables double-pulse stimulation to produce a new mode of

unidirectional block, in which only an antegrade front propagates away from the stimula-

tion site. On any closed circuit with two activation fronts travelling in opposite direction,

this opens a large spatio-temporal window in which an ectopic focus or an external source

ﬁring twice can start a reentry. This is consistent with the use of burst pacing as a standard

18

experimental and clinical procedure to start tachycardia [28, 29, 30, 31]. In a loop already

holding a SW reentry, the S1 − S2 protocol can induced the simultaneous propagation of two

antegrade fronts whose ﬁnal outcome depends on the timing of the stimuli and the length

of the loop. The transient or persistent coexistence of two antegrade fronts is a new type

of dynamics in which the eﬀects of the stimuli cannot be represent as perturbations of a

limit-cycle, as it has been done for models in which the steep slope criteria was not fulﬁll

[32, 33].

In clinical and experimental investigations, stimulations are currently used to either study

the characteristics of reentry circuits through resetting or to stop the tachycardias [5, 18].

Most often, stimulations are applied at one site and propagation is assessed through one

or a few recording electrodes. We may consider the dynamics that will be observed with

this setting for each of the three scenarios of annihilation by alternans ampliﬁcation. Since

the distance traveled by R1 from xs to xc usually covers a small portion of the reentry

pathway, electrodes are much more likely to be positioned in the complementary portion of

the circuit. For [A1

1 ⊣, A1

2 ⊣], such electrodes will detect the last passage of F before the

collision with R1, then A1 and A2. The detection of A1 and A2 would clearly exclude classical

unidirectional block being responsible for the annihilation. In fact, this modeling study was

initiated after a set of experimental and clinical studies on ﬂutter using multichannel (4 to 8

channels) recordings [26]. In these, cases of annihilation were reported in which F , A1 , A2

were detected, and in which the propagation of A1 and A2 was blocked in the segment of the

circuit were the collision of F and A1 was presumed to have occurred. This scenario, that

was called collision block, is consistent with the [A1
1 ⊣, A2

[15]. In the case of [A2

2 ⊣] block, A1 and A2 would be detected twice (see 5B). Since

1 ⊣, A1

2 ⊣] block by alternans ampliﬁcation

the time intervals from each A1 to the next A2 are longer than that between A2 and the

following A1, the sequence of the diﬀerences between activation times alternates around a

value shorter than the period of the original reentry, the block occurring after the longer

interval of the time series. For [A3

2 ⊣], each front is seen thrice, with similar oscillation
in the time series of the diﬀerence. However, the structure of oscillation of the cycle as well

1 ⊣, A3

as the last value before annihilation depend on the position of the electrode in the circuit. In

a protocol for annihilation by unidirectional block, the detection of A1 and A2 would indicate

that the stimuli were beyond the vulnerable window and would trigger the application of

a new stimulus at shorter coupling interval. However, this could rather reinitiate a reentry

19

bound to stop by alternans ampliﬁcation.

To allow the unidirectional block of R2, S1 must be applied early beyond the vulnerable

window, in the portion of the excitable gap referred as partially refractory by electrophys-

iologists [12, 34]. The prematurity of S1, in conjunction with the high slope of the APD

restitution curve and of the θ dispersion curve, create a concave asymmetrical proﬁle of

Trep(x) around xs. For a given S1, the ∆S1−S2 intervals for which R2 is blocked depends

on the local dynamics around xs that is again determined by the APD restitution and the

dispersion of θ. In fact, when the parameters DS1 is used to describe the timing of the ﬁrst

stimulus, the [DS1, ∆S1−S2] range to get a block of R2 becomes independent of L.

The pivotal role of the ASP (D) and θ(D)functions is further conﬁrmed by the capacity

of the ID model to reproduce the dynamics of the ionic model. However, in order to avoid

discontinuity in Trep(x) in the region where R2 is blocked and get a correct representation of

the dynamics, spatial averaging must be included in the computation of the spatial proﬁle of

Trep(x). Originally, spatial averaging was added to the ID model to reproduce the modulation

of the repolarization by resistive coupling in order to correct the shortcomings of the model

regarding the details of the bifurcation from periodic to QP propagation [9]. Including spatial

averaging becomes even more essential when stimulations and blocks produce steep gradients

in Trep(x) [15].

While the wide range of [DS1, ∆S1−S2] for which R2 is blocked does not depends on L,

this is not the case for the subset of this interval leading to reentry annihilation by alternans

ampliﬁcation. As shown in ﬁg. 6, the interval of block is very large for L ≃ Lcrit and

decreases gradually until it disappears at L ≃ 2Lmode-1

. For the MBR model used herein,

min

annihilation by alternans ampliﬁcation exists for 30.5 > L > 19.4 cm, and it occurs on a

range of [DS1, ∆S1−S2] that remains much wider than the ∼ 1 ms standard vulnerable window

for most of this range of L. This is consistent with the result of a clinical study in which dual

pulses stimulation was found to be four times more eﬀective than single stimulus to stop

monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in man [35]. As L is increased, the [DS1, ∆S1−S2] area

of R2 block also encloses a growing number of tongues with increasingly prolong coexistence

of A1 and A2, a process that culminates in the appearance of zones of transition to DW

reentry. Then the zones with transition to DW reentry extend until they cover completely the

area in which R2 is blocked. From L ≃ 2Lcrit, blocking R2 yields automatically to sustained

DW reentry. Hence, transition to DW reentry does not necessarily imply a heterogeneous

20

substrate as it is been proposed elsewhere [36, 37], but can also be achieved in a homogeneous

medium through the creation of a functional heterogeneity by a limited number of electrical

stimulations. Annihilation and transition to DW occur on separated ranges of loop lengths.

On shorter loop, reentry annihilation is produced when alternans ampliﬁcation reaches an

amplitude high enough to block A1and A2. On longer loop, the distributed alternans saturate

at an amplitude that still permits sustained propagation. In our version of the BR model, the

transition from SW QP to period-1 reentry at Lcrit is supercritical. However, we have shown

that, for other sets of parameters, the bifurcation is subcritical, with bistability between QP

and period-1 reentry near Lcrit [8]. In these cases, it is possible that the two-stimulations

protocol applied to the SW period-1 reentry near Lcrit could induced a transition to SW

QP propagation, a phenomenon that was not possible with the instance of the MBR model

used in this paper.

Our results are consistent with diﬀerent clinical and experimental observations, and open

the possibility to design more eﬀective anti-arrhythmic pacing strategies. However, the

modeling studies must be extended to more realistic representations to evaluate properly

potential applications. Preliminary results from an ongoing work on a two-dimensional

annulus show that block by alternans ampliﬁcation can still be obtained on this setting, but

that additional scenarios are possible, including termination through transient ﬁbrillation

that has also been observed in real cardiac tissue. Tissue heterogeneity, either at the level

of the ionic properties or of the cells coupling, could also be important since termination of

reentry has been obtained in a one-dimensional loop model embedding a small area of slower

conduction but using an ionic model with minimal APD restitution properties [38, 39]. It

remains to be seen if annihilation based on alternans ampliﬁcation would be ampliﬁed or

reduced by the inclusion of spatial inhomogeneity. Investigation will also have to be extended

to bidomain model in order to get a more proper representation of the stimulus. The

simpliﬁed representation used herein can be an acceptable approximation for low amplitude

stimuli or to mimic the eﬀect spontaneous ﬁring of a group of cells. However it is known

that current spread of the stimulus depend on the properties of the external and internal

medium [40, 41]. The MBR representation of the ionic properties is also oversimpliﬁed.

However, since most phenomena described in this paper occurs in the few ﬁrst beat after

the stimulations and can be explained from the APD restitution and speed dispersion, it is

unlikely that slow memory eﬀects appearing in the dynamics of more complex model would

21

change the behaviour. Characterizing the APD restitution and speed dispersion of the more

complex model in the range of frequency of repetitive activity associated to reentry should

allow a prediction of the possible dynamics.

V. CONCLUSION

This work is a further illustration of the richness and diversity of the dynamics that

can results from the restitution of APD and dispersion of the speed even in a simpliﬁed

model of the tissue. It has revealed some unexpected behaviours, like block by alternans

ampliﬁcation, which can be much more prevalent than the mechanism of unidirectional block

that are usually assumed to be dominant. The low-dimensional model whose behaviour is

equivalent to the ionic model, provides a generic understanding of the dynamics that can

used a guideline to investigate the eﬀects of future complexiﬁcation of the model.

APPENDIX A: THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE ∆S1−S2 INTERVAL FOR DOUBLE-

WAVE CREATION

Three conditions must be fulﬁlled for the block to occur: 1) R2, the retrograde front

created by S2, must be blocked between the stimulation site xsand xc, the locus of the

collision between the reentry front F and retrograde front R1 created by S1; 2) afterward,

A1, the antegrade front produced by S1, must be blocked when it returns near xs; 3) ﬁnally,

A2, the antegrade front produced by S2, must also be blocked when it travels between xs and

xc The following three appendixes formulate the constraints associated with each of these

conditions. In all three appendixes, we consider that F, A1and A2 travels toward increasing

value of x, we use Trep,F (xs), the repolarization time associated to the passage of the last

activation front of the reentry F at xS, as the reference time t = 0, and introduce a spatial

coordinate y = (xs − x) ≥ 0 to follow the retrograde fronts R1 and R2.

R2 can propagate as long as its activation time Tact,R2(x) is larger than Trep,R1(x), the

repolarization time associated to R1. In the limiting case Tact,R2(x) = Trep,R1(x), DR2(x) =

Tact,R2(x)−Trep,R1(x) = 0, and R2 travels with the maximum conduction time −dTact,R2/dx =

ct (0) =ct,max. When R2 reaches a point xc < x0 < xs with DR2(x0) = 0, it can continue to

propagate if |dTrep,R1(x0)/dx| ≤ ct,max. The limiting case for the propagation of R2 is thus

except for a short interval of D close to 0. As a consequence, we approximate that both

R1 and F have been propagating with the minimum conduction time (i.e. maximum speed)

ct,min, such that

Trep,F (y) ≃ −ct,miny

Tact,R1(y) ≃ DS1 + ct,miny

DR1(y) = Tact,R1(y) − Trep,F (y) ≃ DS1 + 2ct,miny

Substituting these relations in eq. A2 yields

Taking the spatial derivatives of eq. A3 yields

Trep,R1 (y) ≃ DS1 + ct,miny + ASP (DS1 + 2ct,miny)

(A3)

The existence and location of the critical point depends on the slope of the restitution curve,

and on the relative diﬀerence between the maximum and minimum conduction time. From

the ct(D) given by eq. 4 , ct,max ≃ 3.13ct,min, and

≃ 1.065.

Using eq. 5 to solve this equation, we obtain that Dmax ≈ DS1 + 2ct,miny0 ≃ 70 ms. This

result means that, if DS1 > Dmax ≃ 70 ms, |dTrep,R1/dx| < ct,max everywhere between xc

and xs, and R2 cannot be blocked. It means also that if DS1 < Dmax, there is a critical

point xc < x0 < xs whose position depends on DS1 but is independent of L. The last step is

to determine the maximum ∆S1−S2 (∆S1−S2,max) to get a block of R2 at the x0. Assuming

again that R2 travels with the minimum conduction time, the ﬁrst condition of eq. A1

becomes

reducing to the limit

DS1 + ct,miny + ASP (Dmax) = DS1 + ∆S1−S2,max + ct,miny

∆S1−S2,max = ASP (Dmax)

The maximum ∆S1−S2 for the block of R2 is independent of L and of DS1, provided that

.DS1 < Dmax. For S2 to induce propagation ∆S1−S2, must also be ≥ AP D(DS1), which is

the refractory period at xs. In summary, for all 0 ≤ DS1 ≤ Dmax ≃ 70 ms, R2 blocks if
AP DSP (DS1) ≤ ∆S1−S2 ≤ ASP (Dmax).

The main approximation used herein is that both R1 and R2 propagate everywhere with

the minimal propagation time. With regard to R1, the error introduces by the approximation

is minimal unless DS1 ≃ 0. For R2, the conduction time is obviously underestimated when

its activation time comes close to Trep,R1. The approximation thus overestimates Dmax, whose

value is around 50 ms for the ID and IL model, compared to the Dmax = 70 ms provided

by the approximation.

APPENDIX B: BLOCK OF A1 AFTER ONE ROTATION ON THE LOOP

Appendix A shows that ∀DS1 ∈ [0, Dmax], R2 exist and is blocked if ∆S1−S2 ∈
[AP DSP (DS1), ASP (Dmax)], a set of conditions that do not depend on L. The next event

is the annihilation A1 when it returns near xs and hits the refractory tail left A2. Using

Trep,F (xs) as a reference time A1 comes back to xs at the time DS1 + τA1, in which τA1 is the

time taken by A1 to propagates over the loop on its ﬁrst turn. It is blocked if the system is

still refractory, which means

Trep,S2 > DS1 + τA1

(B1)

26

Neglecting the eﬀect of coupling on repolarization, Trep,S2 is approximated as:

Trep,S2 ≃ DS1 + ∆S1−S2 + ASP (DS2)

in which DS2, the diastolic interval associated to S2, is estimated by

Substituting eq. B2 and B3 in eq. B1 yields

DS2 ≃ ∆S1−S2 − ASP (DS1)

∆S1−S2 + ASP (∆S1−S2 − ASP (DS1)) > τA1,

in which τA1 is the only non- local term. For most ionic models and experimental prepara-

tions, τA1 is a monotonic decreasing function of DS1 (as in ﬁg. 4 of ref.

[15]). The eﬀect

of the prematurity on the return cycle comes from the steepness of the ct dispersion curve

(eq. 4) which is close to ct,min as soon as D is greater than a few tenths of ms. Therefore,

the prolongation of the return cycle depends on the limited region beyond xs over which A1

does not propagate at the maximum speed. Hence, we write

τA1 (DS1, L) ≈ Lct,min + f (DS1)

(B5)

where f is maximum for DS1 = 0 and

df
dDS1

< 0,

lim
DS1−→∞

f = 0

The condition B4 for the block of A1 becomes

∆S1−S2 + ASP (∆S1−S2 − ASP (DS1)) > Lct,min + f (DS1) .

Consider

∆lim

S1−S2 + ASP (∆lim

S1−S2 − ASP (DS1)) = Lct,min + f (DS1)

as the minimum value of ∆S1−S2 to get a block of A1.

Lets consider next the case where DS1 < Dmax and ∆S1−S2 = ASP (DS1), for which

DS2 = 0. The condition for the block of A1 becomes

(B3)

(B7)

ASP (DS1) + ASP (0) = Lct,min + f (DS1)

which cannot be fulﬁlled since both DS1 and ASP (0) are smaller than the diastolic interval
of the free reentry. The block of A1 will occur from the minimum ∆S1−S2 > ASP (DS1).
This explains why the dynamical regime [A1

2 ⊣] is found in the lower portion of the

1 →, A1

[DS1, ∆S1−S2] area in which R2 blocked, as seen in ﬁgure 4.

The condition for the block of R2 are that DS1 ∈ [0, Dmax] and ∆S1−S2 ∈
[AP DSP (DS1), ASP (Dmax)]. Since the right hand side of eq. B7 is a growing function
S1−S2 for any ﬁxed value of DS1 must also increase with L until reaching ASP (Dmax).

Hence, there is a limit value of L from which A1cannot be blocked on its ﬁrst return. For
S1−S2 = AP DSP (Dmax) = ∆S1−S2,max, eq. B7 becomes

APPENDIX C: BLOCK OF A2 AFTER ONE ROTATION ON THE LOOP

Appendix B shows that A1 is blocked only over a subset of the [DS1, ∆S1−S2] area for
which R2 exist and is blocked (i.e. DS1 ∈ [0, Dmax], ∆S1−S2 ∈ [AP DSP (DS1), ASP (Dmax)]).
With respect to ∆S1−S2, the lower bound of this subset is greater than AP DSP (DS1) and
increases with L, while the upper bound remains constant at ASP (Dmax). With respect to

Ds1,the variation of the limits of this subset is given by a complex expression that depends on

the slope of both the restitution and dispersion curves. For the MBR model, the upper DS1

of the subset decreases toward 0 as L is increased. The last step is to obtain the conditions

for the block of A2.

A2 blocks between xc and the locus where R2 has stopped when it hits the refractory tail

left by A1. Using the y coordinate, the condition for the block of A2 is that there is a point

28

where

Trep,A1 (y) > Tact,A2 (y)

(C1)

Trep,A1(y) is approximated as Tact,A1 (y) + ASP (DA1 (y) ,where DA1 (y) = Tact,A1 (y) −

Trep,R1 (y) since R2 has not propagated in this region. Using eq. A3 of appendix A for

Trep,R1(y) and eq. B5 of appendix B for Tact,A1 (y) yields

Trepol,A1 = DS1 + Lct,min + f (DS1) − ct,miny + ASP (DA1 (y)

(C2)

DA1 (y) = Lct,min + f (DS1) − 2ct,miny − ASP (DS1 + 2ct,miny)

Tact,A2 (y) = DS1 + ∆S1−S2 + τA2(y) where τA2 is the time needed for A2 to travel from the

stimulation site to y. For A1, we have assumed in B that the prolongation of the return

cycle was occurring mainly in a short region around xs beyond which A1 was travelling

at maximal speed. The situation is diﬀerent for A2. As it could be seen in ﬁg. 5 A, the

D associated to A2 as it propagates away form xs,meaning that it speed of propagation

diminishes. Nevertheless, we write

τA2(y) = Lct,min + g (DS1,Ds2) − ct,miny

(C3)

With eq. C2 and C3, the condition C1 for the block A2 after one rotation becomes

f (DS1) + ASP (DA1 (y)) > ∆S1−S2 + g (DS1, DS2)

(C4)

To get the [A1

1 ⊣, A1
fulﬁlled, leading to the ﬁnal condition:

2 ⊣] block, the conditions given by eq. B6 and eq. C4 must both be

ASP

∆S1−S2 − ASP (DS1)

> Lct,min + g (DS1, DS2) − ASP (DA1 (y)) .

with the supplementary constraint that ∆S1−S2 and DS1 must remain in the interval where

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

R2 is block. Since both ∆S1−S2 and DS1 are bound, there is a limiting L value beyond

29

1 ⊣, A1

which [A1

2 ⊣] block cannot occur. For the IL and ID model, we found that A2 was
always stop when A1 was blocked, meaning that eq. C4 was fulﬁlled whenever eq. B6

was satisﬁed. However, the condition depends on the restitution and dispersion curve and,

through g (DS1, DS2), the interaction of A2 with the spatial proﬁle of Trepol left by A1.

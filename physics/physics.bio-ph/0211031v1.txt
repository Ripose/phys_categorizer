Abstract

The primitive data for deducing the Miyazawa-Jernigan contact energy or BLOSUM score matrix

consists of pair frequency counts. Each amino acid corresponds to a conditional probability distribu-

tion. Based on the deviation of such conditional probability from random background, a scheme for

reduction of amino acid alphabet is proposed. It is observed that evident discrepancy exists between

reduced alphabets obtained from raw data of the Miyazawa-Jernigan’s and BLOSUM’s residue pair

counts. Taking homologous sequence database SCOP40 as a test set, we detect homology with the

obtained coarse-grained substitution matrices. It is veriﬁed that the reduced alphabets obtained well

preserve information contained in the original 20-letter alphabet.

1 Introduction

Experimental investigation has strongly suggested that protein folding can be achieved with fewer letters

than the 20 naturally occurring amino acids [1, 2]. The native structure and physical properties of the

protein Rop is maintained when its 32-residue hydrophobic core is formed with only Ala and Leu residues

[3]. Another example is the ﬁve-letter alphabet of Baker’s group for 38 out of 40 selected sites of the

SH3 chain [4]. The mutational tolerance can be high in many regions of protein sequences. Heterogeneity

or diversity in interaction must be present for polypeptides to have protein-like properties. However, the

1

physics and chemistry of polypeptide chains consisting of fewer than 20 letters may be suﬃciently simpliﬁed

for a thorough understanding of the protein folding.

A central task of protein sequence analysis is to uncover the exact nature of the information encoded in

the primary structure. We still cannot read the language describing the ﬁnal 3D fold of an active biological

macromolecule. Compared with the DNA sequence, a protein sequence is generally much shorter, but the

size of the alphabet is ﬁve times larger. A proper coarse graining of the 20 amino acids into fewer clusters

is important for improving the signal-to-noise ratio when extracting information by statistical means.

Based on Miyazawa-Jernigan’s (MJ) residue-residue statistical potential [5], Wang and Wang (WW)

reduced the alphabet [6]. They introduced a ‘minimal mismatch’ principle to ensure that all interactions

between amino acids belonging to any two given groups are as similar to one another as possible. The

knowledge-based MJ potential is derived from the frequencies of contacts between diﬀerent amino acid

residues in a set of known native protein structure databases. Murphy, Wallqvist and Levy (MWL) [7]

approached the same problem using the BLOSUM matrix derived by Henikoﬀ and Henikoﬀ [8]. The matrix

is deduced from amino acid pair frequencies in aligned blocks of a protein sequence database, and is widely

used for sequence alignment and comparison.

The problem of alphabet reduction may be viewed as cluster analysis, which is a well developed topic

[9, 10]. WW used the mismatch as an objective function without any resemblance measure. MWL adopted

a cosine-like resemblance coeﬃcient (with a non-standard normalization) from the BLOSUM score matrix

without any objective function, and took the arithmetic mean of scores to deﬁne the cluster center. It is

our purpose to propose an algorithm for selecting a reduced alphabet based on deviation of conditional

probability from random background, and to compare results obtained from diﬀerent schemes of reduction.

2 Reduction of amino acid alphabets

Either the MJ contact energies or BLOSUM score matrices are deduced from the primitive frequency counts

of amino acid pairs. Taking the BLOSUM matrix as an example for speciﬁcity, following Henikoﬀ and

Henikoﬀ [8], we denote the total number of amino acid i, j pairs (1

i, j

20) by fij. It is convenient to

≤

≤

introduce another set of f ′

ij with f ′

ij = fij/2 for i

= j and f ′

ii = fii, which deﬁnes a joint probability for

2

6
each i, j pair

The probability for the amino acid i to occur is then

ij = f ′
q′

ij/f,

f =

20

Xi=1

Xj=1

f ′

pi =

Xj=1

ij .

Each amino acid i may be described by the conditional probability vector

p(j

i)
}
|

{

20
j=1 with p(j

i)
|

≡

q′
ij/pi.

This conditional probability has been used as the attribute of amino acids in an entropic cluster analysis

[11].

We introduce a vector V(i) to characterize amino acid i. This vector has its components

V (i)
j = ln (p(j

i)/pj),
|

j = 1, 2, . . . 20,

being the logarithmic odds describing the deviation of the conditional probability p(j

i) from the ‘random
|

background’ pj, the probability of occurrence for amino acid j. (V (i)

j

is essentially the BLOSUM score.) A

group γ of several amino acids may be described by the weighted average vector

where the summation is taken over the amino acids in the group.

Regarding U(γ) as the group center, the distance of amino acid i in the group from the center may be

described by

V (i)
j −
|

U (γ)
j

. When we divide the 20 amino acids into clusters, we may measure the quality of
|

clustering with the following weighted sum of distances

U(γ) =

which will be called the error function of clustering. For the original 20 amino acids with each forming a

cluster, we have simply E = 0. when amino acids are further clustered into fewer clusters, E increases. For

a ﬁxed total number n of clusters, the best clustering is obtained when value E is minimized.

Starting with the amino acid pair counts of the MJ and BLOSUM matrices, we perform simulated

annealing for minimization of E. The results for reduced alphabets derived from MJ and BLOSUM counts

are shown in Tables I and II, respectively.

3 Homology detection with reduced alphabets

It is well known that there is no generally accepted ‘best’ method among many existing algorithms for

clustering. To evaluate the validity of the above scheme for reduction of amino acid alphabets, we examine

whether the reduced alphabets still preserve homology of proteins.

An element of the BLOSUM matrices or BLOSUM score is deﬁned as sij = log2(q′

ij /(pipj)). Once a

reduced amino acid alphabet is found, its coarse-grained BLOSUM scores may be calculated similarly by

sγδ = log2 

m∈δ q′

lm



,

(cid:1)



(cid:16)P

which is the analogue of sij for clusters γ and δ. Using such coarse-grained BLOSUM50 substitution matrices,

we perform all-against-all sequence alignment on SCOP40 database [12, 13] with Blast2.0 [14, 15]. The gap

insertion and elongation parameters used for alignment are set to 11/1. Filter option is closed. Detection of

homology, i.e. identiﬁcation of the superfamily for each sequence in the database, is illustrated by coverage

as a function of errors per query for a set of expectation value thresholds. The coverage is deﬁned as

the number of homologous pairs detected divided by the total number of homologous pairs present in the

database. The error per query is deﬁned as the total number of non-homologous protein sequences detected

with expectation value equal to or greater than the threshold divided by the total number of aligned sequence

pairs. By varying the expectation value cutoﬀ of Blast2.0, the error per query value is calculated for each

clustering scheme and adjusted to 0.001 to identify homologous sequences. The coverage as a function of

the number of amino acid clusters is shown in Fig. 1. To compare with Ref. [7], in the ﬁgure the coverage

obtained with the MWL scheme is also shown. In general, our coverage values are superior to those of MWL.

We further study the linear regression between alignment scores s and s′ for homologous pairs obtained

by searching with the original and coarse-grained BLOSUM50 matrices, respectively. We calculate the

correlation coeﬃcient r and covariance σ

with

4 Discussion

In the above we have proposed a scheme for amino acid alphabet reduction based on the deviation of con-

ditional probability from random background. We have detected homology of sequences in SCOP database

with the derived coarse-grained BLOSUM similarity matrices.

From Tables 1 and 2, we see that the clustering using residue pair counts of either MJ or BLOSUM is

not completely hierachical. That is, clusters formed in an early step need not be preserved in a latter step.

Such a reversal case exists for both MJ and BLOSUM, but is rare for both.

The clustering based on MJ shows evident discrepancy from that based on BLOSUM. For example,

Tyr(Y) groups with Phe(F) in an early stage (12 clusters) for BLOSUM, while Tyr is still separated until the

stage of 2 clusters. Another example is Val(V) and Ala(A). The MJ data take each residue in a structure into

account, whereas the BLOSUM data focus more on aligned blocks. From the way that the pair frequency

counts are obtained, the BLOSUM data are more related to the evolutional diﬀerence of residues, while

the MJ data are related to structure diﬀerence. However, for both MJ and BLOSUM the separation of

hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups is rather clear.

It is observed that the MJ contact energies can be largely attributed to hydrophobicity of the residue pair

involved [16]. We see a strong correlation between our classiﬁcation based on MJ and hydrophobic values of

amino acids [17] as shown in the example

Furthermore, we do see Baker’s ﬁve representative letters (AIGEK) [4] and Schafmeister’s seven letters [18],

except for an additional cluster consisting of the extraordinary single member Cys(C).

Our results of homology recognition with reduced alphabets indicate that there is no signiﬁcant drop

in the coverage as long as the number of letters is not smaller than 9. The percentage coverage retained

is reduced by only 10% for 9 letters. The correlation coeﬃcient and covariance calculated from the linear

regression between the alignment scores obtained with the original and coarse-grained BLOSUM matrices

agree with this very well. A strong correlation in scores is seen for number of letters not less than 9. The

5

correlation coeﬃcient and covariance are still reasonable even though the number of clusters is as small as

5. We may conclude that the 9-letter alphabet preserves most information of the original 20-letter alphabet,

and the 5-letter alphabet is still a reasonable choice.

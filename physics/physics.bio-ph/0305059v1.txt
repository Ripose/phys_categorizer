Two adaptation processes in auditory hair cells together can provide an
active ampliﬁer

Andrej Vilfan∗ and Thomas Duke
Cavendish Laboratory, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0HE, UK†

(Dated: 15. May 2003)

The hair cells of the vertebrate inner ear convert mechanical stimuli to electrical signals. Two
adaptation mechanisms are known to modify the ionic current ﬂowing through the transduction
channels of the hair bundles: a rapid process involves Ca2+ ions binding to the channels; and a
slower adaptation is associated with the movement of myosin motors. We present a mathematical
model of the hair cell which demonstrates that the combination of these two mechanisms can
produce ‘self-tuned critical oscillations’, i.e. maintain the hair bundle at the threshold of an
oscillatory instability. The characteristic frequency depends on the geometry of the bundle and
on the Ca2+ dynamics, but is independent of channel kinetics. Poised on the verge of vibrating,
the hair bundle acts as an active ampliﬁer. However, if the hair cell is suﬃciently perturbed, other
dynamical regimes can occur. These include slow relaxation oscillations which resemble the hair
bundle motion observed in some experimental preparations.

Introduction

Hair cells of the inner ear detect mechanical stimuli
by deﬂections of the hair bundle, which open tension-
gated transduction channels in the cell membrane to ad-
mit cations from the endolymph. The current is mostly
composed of potassium ions, but also includes a small
quantity of calcium ions (Lumpkin et al., 1997). Ex-
periments in which hair bundles are held at a ﬁxed de-
ﬂection, using a microneedle, have revealed two adap-
tation processes that modify the transduction current,
causing it to decline with time (Holt and Corey, 2000;
Holt et al., 2002; Howard and Hudspeth, 1987, 1988;
Wu et al., 1999). The ﬁrst, which can occur on a sub-
millisecond time scale, is dependent on the concentration
of Ca2+ in the endolymph. It is believed to be a conse-
quence of Ca2+ entering the hair bundle and binding to
the transduction channels, making them more likely to
close. The second, which takes up to hundreds of mil-
liseconds, is also dependent on Ca2+ concentration, and
is thought to be caused by the movement of adaptation
motors attached to the transduction channels, which ad-
justs the tension that gates them.

A number of experiments have demonstrated that
hair bundles can generate active oscillations, both in
preparations of dissected tissue (Benser et al., 1993;
Crawford and Fettiplace, 1985; Martin et al., 2000) and
in vivo (Manley et al., 2001).
It has been shown on
theoretical grounds that the active oscillatory mecha-
nism can provide an explanation for the high sensitiv-
ity and sharp frequency selectivity of auditory receptors
(Camalet et al., 2000; Choe et al., 1998; Eguiluz et al.,
2000; Ospeck et al., 2001) if the system is poised on the

verge of spontaneous oscillation. This critical point cor-
responds to a Hopf bifurcation of the active dynamical
system.
It has been suggested that a feedback mech-
anism operates to maintain the system at the critical
point where it is most sensitive, leading to the concept
of self-tuned critical oscillations. (Camalet et al., 2000).

The purpose of this article is to provide a coherent
model for the active ampliﬁer in hair cells, based on the
combined action of the two known adaptation mecha-
nisms. In our model the interaction of Ca2+ ions with
the transduction channels generates an oscillatory insta-
bility of the hair bundle. Working on a slower time scale,
the adaptation motors act to tune this dynamical system
to the critical point, at which it just begins to oscillate.
The two adaptation mechanisms together constitute a
dynamical system displaying a self-tuned Hopf bifurca-
tion (Camalet et al., 2000). Poised at the oscillatory in-
stability, the hair bundle is especially responsive to faint
sounds.

Our model diﬀers from two published models of hair-
bundle oscillations. Choe, Magnasco and Hudspeth
(1998) have previously proposed that channel reclosure
induced by Ca2+ ions can generate a Hopf instability.
In their scheme the oscillation frequency is controlled by
the kinetics of the transduction channel. In our model
the frequency of spontaneous oscillations is governed, in-
stead, by the architecture of the bundle and by the rate
at which the calcium concentration equilibrates. This is
more consistent with the ﬁnding that the rate at which
the transduction channel switches is faster than the char-
acteristic frequency, especially in low-frequency hair cells
(Corey and Hudspeth, 1983). Camalet et al. (2000) have
suggested that the Hopf instability is generated by mo-
tor proteins in the kinocilium, and that regulation to
the critical point is accomplished by a feedback mech-
anism involving calcium. Their model is thus the con-
verse of that presented here, but shares the underlying
feature of self-tuned criticality. The current model ac-

cords better with the observation that some hair bundles
lack a kinocilium and others do not change their behav-
ior signiﬁcantly when the kinocilium is interfered with
(Martin et al., 2003).

In addition to demonstrating that the two adaptation
processes can combine to provide an active ampliﬁer, we
derive expressions that indicate how properties like the
characteristic frequency of critical oscillations, and the
sensitivity of response to sound waves, depend on param-
eters like the bundle height and the number of stereocilia.
We also investigate how the dynamics can be modiﬁed if
conditions are perturbed, and show that the bundle can
exhibit slow relaxation oscillations which diﬀer in many
aspects from critical oscillations, but resemble the active
movements recently observed in experiments on hair cells
from the frog sacculus (Martin and Hudspeth, 1999).

Three-state model of the transduction channel. Note that
Ca2+ binds to the channel when it is already in a closed state.
The presence of Ca2+ therefore does not directly cause chan-
nel re-closure, but it does stabilize the closed state and delay
re-opening.

Hair bundles in diﬀerent species, or from hair cells with
diﬀerent characteristic frequencies within the same organ
of thte internal ear of a particular animal, can vary in
shape and size, and also in the way that they are cou-
pled to external mechanical vibrations (Hudspeth, 1997).
Generally, one can distinguish between free-standing hair

bundles (e.g. some reptiles, mammalian inner hair cells)
and those who tips are embedded in an accessory struc-
ture (e.g. other reptiles, birds, amphibial saccular hair
cells). In experiments on dissected tissue, the accessory
structure is usually removed. In this paper we will re-
strict our discussion to the simplest situation of a free-
standing hair bundle. A bundle that is directly connected
to the tectorial membrane could be described in a similar
fashion, but using modiﬁed expressions for the stiﬀness,
the friction and the coupling to the external signal.

The hair bundle (see Fig. 1a) is composed of N stere-
ocilia which slope up against each other, the longest of
which has length L. Typically, N and L are inversely
related, with the range N = 20
300 (Holt and Corey,
−
2000) corresponding to L = 30
2 µm. Each stereocilium
is joined to the next by an elastic ﬁlament – the tip link –
which connects to a tension-gated transduction channel
in the cell membrane (Corey and Hudspeth, 1983; for a
review see Markin and Hudspeth, 1995). The tension in
the tip link can be adjusted by a group of myosin mo-
tors, which are connected to the transduction channel
and move it along the actin ﬁlaments inside the stere-
ocilium (Hudspeth and Gillespie, 1994).

−

To set up a coordinate system, we consider ﬁrst a free-
standing bundle. Within a stereocilium, we label the lo-
cation at which the stereocilium touches its shorter neigh-
bor O. The position of the channel (and the attached
motors) relative to O is denoted by l0 + xM, where l0
is the length of a tip link at rest and xM its extension
under tension. When the tip of the bundle is deﬂected
through a lateral displacement X, each stereocilium piv-
ots at its base and adjacent stereocilia are sheared by a
displacement γX. The geometric factor γ may be written
as γ
1 µm is the distance between the
roots of neighboring stereocilia (Howard and Hudspeth,
1988; Howard et al., 1988). We label the new location at
which the stereocilium touches its shorter neighbor O’.
The position of the channel relative to O’ is denoted by
l0 + x. It follows that

The movement of the bundle is countered by an elastic
restoring force, which has two contributions. First, the
deformation of the stereocilia at their base provides an
eﬀective bundle stiﬀness KSP = κN/L2, where κ is the
pivotal stiﬀness of a stereocilium. The measured value
10−16 Nm/rad (Crawford and Fettiplace, 1985;
κ
Hudspeth et al., 2000) indicates that KSP varies from
0.01 pN/nm for tall bundles to 10 pN/nm for short ones.
The second contribution, which scales in the same way
with bundle size and is of similar magnitude, comes from
the tension TTL in the tip links. Movement of the bundle
is also resisted by the viscous drag of the surrounding
ﬂuid which leads to a friction coeﬃcient ζ
ηL for tall
bundles, where η is the viscosity of the endolymph. Thus,
when an external force F is applied to the tip of the bun-
dle, its equation of motion is

(throughout the paper we use the convention ˙X(t)

dt ). Here, we have written TTL = TTL(x, C), antici-
pating that the tension in the tip links depends on the
local intracellular Ca2+ concentration C, as well as vary-
ing with the position x. For future reference, we note
that the mechanical relaxation time of the hair bundle,
τmech = ζ/KSP, varies from a few microseconds to tens
of milliseconds.

Transduction channel

The mechanically-gated transduction channel is the
central component of the model, since we postulate that
hair bundle oscillations are driven by the force that is
generated as the channels change conformation stochasti-
cally, as ﬁrst suggested by Howard and Hudspeth (1988).
It is generally assumed that transmembrane channel pro-
teins can exist in a number of discrete states, some of
which are closed and some open. As indicated in Fig. 1b,
we additionally suppose that the channel protein incor-
porates a lever arm which ampliﬁes the small structural
changes that occur when the channel switches state, and
thereby appreciably modiﬁes the tension in the adjoin-
ing tip link (Martin et al., 2000).

bility that the channel is in state i, and di is the po-
sition of the lever arm in that state, then the aver-

state model of the channel (Corey and Hudspeth, 1983),
with two closed states (i = C1, C2) and one open state
(i = O). The ﬁt indicates that the lever-arm move-
ment is about 5 times greater for the transition C1

O, while more recent data
than for the transition C2

(Martin et al., 2000) suggests that the total movement is
about 8 nm. We therefore assign the lever arm displace-
ments dC1 = 0 nm, dC2 = 7 nm and dO = 8.5 nm. The
i depend on the local Ca2+ concentration
free energies G0
C within the stereocilia (Howard and Hudspeth, 1988),
which is strongly inﬂuenced by the entry of Ca2+ ions
through the channel (Lumpkin and Hudspeth, 1995). A
higher Ca2+ concentration favors closure of the channel,
thereby providing a negative feedback. We model this
dependence empirically, according to experimental obser-
vations (Corey and Hudspeth, 1983), as an eﬀective shift
in the channel gating point proportional to the logarithm

where the constant D has an empirical value of about
4 nm in the bullfrog’s sacculus (Corey and Hudspeth,

standing bundle. One possible interpretation of this func-
tional form, indicated in Fig. 1b, is that Ca2+ binds to
state C2, causing it to switch to state C1 and thereby sta-
bilizing the closed state. We emphasize that our model
does not rely on the channel having three states. A two-
state channel (eliminating state C2) would give substan-
tially similar results.

An important aspect of our model

is that we as-
sume that the channel kinetics are rapid compared
to the bundle oscillations and the calcium dynamics.
The evidence for this assumption comes, for instance,
from saccular hair cells that detect frequencies up to
150 Hz and have channel opening times around 100 µs
(Corey and Hudspeth, 1983). We can therefore consider
the diﬀerent channel states to be thermally equilibrated
with one another, and chemically equilibrated with the
Ca2+ ions. Then we can split the tip link tension TTL into
two components: KTLx, the passive elastic force that the
tip link would contribute in the absence of the transduc-
tion channel; and f , the active contribution arising from
the channel switching states, also called gating force:

Calcium dynamics

The dynamics of the calcium concentration in a stere-
ocilium is inﬂuenced by a number of processes. As
well as the inﬂux of Ca2+ through the transduction
channel, there is an outﬂux due to calcium pumps.
The ions also diﬀuse freely, or in association with mo-
bile buﬀers, and can additionally bind to ﬁxed buﬀers.
A detailed model of this dynamics was developed by
Lumpkin and Hudspeth (1998), but for our purposes it
suﬃces to use a simpliﬁed linearized model in which the
Ca2+ concentration on the inner side of the channel obeys
the equation

˙C =

λ [C

CB

CM pO(x, C)] .

(5)

−

−

−
Here CB is the steady-state concentration which would
occur if the channel were blocked, originating from dif-
fusion from other parts of the cell; CM is the maxi-
mal additional contribution from inﬂux through an open

transduction channel, and is of order 10 µM. The re-
laxation rate of calcium concentration ﬂuctuations, λ, is
an important parameter in our model. We expect the
relaxation time τchem = 1/λ to be of the order of mil-
liseconds, corresponding to the measured fast adaptation
time (Ricci and Fettiplace, 1997). Note that the slow
Ca2+ kinetics (along with fast channel switching) is a
key diﬀerence between our model and that of Choe et al.
(1998), where the converse situation is assumed. The
slow Ca2+ dynamics might seem at odds with the fact
that the binding sites on the channel are reached by the
incoming ions very quickly. But in our model, the chan-
nel is in state C2 when Ca2+ binds, i.e.
it is closed
(Fig. 1b).
It therefore typically senses a concentration
which is determined by diﬀusion within a larger volume,
and which also depends on the interaction of Ca2+ with
ﬁxed and mobile buﬀers. Because a Ca2+ ion binds to one
of the buﬀers in less than 1 µs (Lumpkin and Hudspeth,
1998), the concentration of free Ca2+ equilibrates with
that bound to the buﬀers within a few microseconds
C2. The time-scale of Ca2+ re-
of channel closure O
laxation is therefore determined by buﬀering, diﬀusion
to distant parts of the stereocilium and the activity of
Ca2+ pumps.
Indeed, the inﬂuence of buﬀers on the
fast adaptation process has been observed experimentally
(Ricci and Fettiplace, 1997).

Adaptation motors

Experiments in which a vertebrate hair bundle is sud-
denly displaced (Howard and Hudspeth, 1987; Wu et al.,
1999) show a slow adaptation of the channel current,
on the scale of tens of milliseconds. The transduc-
tion channel is attached to the actin cortex within a
stereocilium by a number of myosin 1C (formerly Iβ)
motors. There is strong evidence that these molecu-
lar motors mediate slow adapatation (Assad and Corey,
1992; Gillespie and Corey, 1997; Holt et al., 2002), pre-
sumably by maintaining the proper tenstion in the tip
link (Hudspeth and Gillespie, 1994). For simplicity, we
assume that the motors have a linear force-velocity rela-
tion, so that

Results and Discussion

Linear stability analysis

In order to examine the dynamical stability of the hair
bundle in the absence of a driving force, F = 0, we make
use of the fact that the adaptation motors operate on
a slower time scale than both the mechanical relaxation
of the bundle and the relaxation of the calcium concen-
tration. We can therefore neglect their motion for now,
and suppose that xM is ﬁxed. This leaves two coupled
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations of motion: Eq. 5 (sup-
plemented with Eq. 3) for the rate of change of Ca2+ con-
centration; and by combining Eqs. 1, 2 & 4, the following
equation for the motion of the transduction channels:

both eigenvalues of J, evaluated at the ﬁxed point, have a
negative real part. This is equivalent (Strogatz, 1994) to
the two conditions: det J > 0, and Tr J < 0. The number
of ﬁxed points is most readily appreciated by consider-
ing the form of Eq. 8 for the velocity ˙x as a function of
displacement x (see Fig. 2). Two distinct situations can
arise depending on the strength of the calcium feedback:
(i) Consider ﬁrst the case of weak feedback, so that
the Ca2+ concentration C in the stereocilia is approxi-
mately constant. Typically ˙x(x, C = const) varies non-
monotonically with x. This is a consequence of a region
of eﬀective negative elasticity, caused by the redistribu-
tion of the transduction channel states when the bun-
dle is moved (Howard and Hudspeth, 1987; Martin et al.,

FIG. 2 Velocity ˙x as a function of displacement x for a ﬁxed
location of the motors xM. If the Ca2+ concentration is held
constant,
˙x(x, C = const) typically has a region of negative
slope (solid lines, for three diﬀerent hypothetical values of
C). For a certain range of values of C, the system can then
have three ﬁxed points. But if the Ca2+ concentration is
allowed to adjust, the curve ˙x(x, C = C(x)), where C(x) is
the steady-state solution of Eq. 5, rises monotonically with x
(dotted line). There is then a single ﬁxed point. The channel
parameters are G0
O = 70 zJ, dC1 =
0 nm, dC2 = 7 nm, dO = 8.5 nm and D = 4 nm. With these
O ≈ 9kBT (in a simpliﬁed two-state
channel parameters KTLd2

condition for the occurrence of a negative slope is KTLd2
O >

2000). At large displacements – both positive and neg-
ative – the tension TTL in the tip links is determined
by their passive elasticity. But at intermediate displace-
ments, the occupancy of the closed state C1 declines
rapidly with increasing x; the resulting force f , caused
by the swing of the lever arm, is negative and reduces the
tension in the tip links so that TTL decreases with increas-
ing x. This eﬀect has been termed ‘gating compliance’
by Howard and Hudspeth (1987). As indicated in Fig. 2,
there will then be either one or three ﬁxed points. Ac-
cording to the index theorem (Strogatz, 1994, Sect. 6.8)
out of 2n + 1 ﬁxed points, n will be saddle-points. There-
fore, if the system has three ﬁxed points, the central ﬁxed
point is a saddle point and the other two may be either
stable or unstable. The number of ﬁxed points depends
on the values of the channel parameters, but also on the
motor position xM. Their stability depends additionally
on the values of the dynamical model parameters (ζ and
λ). A typical example of the location and nature of the
ﬁxed points, as a function of the motor position xM, is
shown in Fig. 3a; in this particular case, the bundle dis-
plays a region of bistability. We shall return to this situ-
ation later, to discuss the dynamical behavior of the hair
bundle in recent in vitro experiments.

termine the ﬁxed points it is appropriate to consider the

In this case, there is a single ﬁxed point (Fig. 3b),
which may be either stable (if Tr J < 0) or unstable (if
Tr J > 0).
In the latter situation, the bundle under-
goes limit-cycle oscillations. Signiﬁcantly, the stability
depends on the location of the motors xM, in addition to
the values of the other model parameters. Typically the
critical point at which Tr J = 0 is a supercritical Hopf
bifurcation, which means that the system is continuously
controllable, passing smoothly from the quiescent to the
vibrating state as indicated in Fig. 4. Thus by moving

a stochastic simulation with full channel kinetics, but in the
absence of external (thermal) noise. The upper and lower line
show the average maximum and minimum values of the dis-
placement during one period of oscillation. Note that even in
the quiescent phase the amplitude is non-zero, due to channel
noise. The noisy motion in the quiescent phase has a very
diﬀerent spectrum from the oscillating phase, however.

along the stereocilia, the motors can determine whether
the bundle stays still, or with what amplitude it oscillates
spontaneously.

Frequency of limit-cycle oscillations

We propose that the regime of strong calcium feed-
back, in which the bundle can oscillate spontaneously, is
the regime that is relevant for auditory hair cells in nor-
mal physiological condititions. The control parameter
2 Tr J
that determines the stability of the bundle is ǫ = 1
and the Hopf bifurcation occurs at ǫ = 0. It is worth em-
phasizing that within the scope of a non-inertial model
with two variables (x and C), in order for the bundle
to oscillate spontaneously, it is essential that either the
bundle displays a region of negative elasticity at constant
Ca2+ concentration, or that there is a positive feedback
in the Ca2+ dynamics. The second option would imply
that an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration
would enhance the Ca2+ inﬂow, which contradicts the
present experimental evidence. Our model only allows
for the ﬁrst option and from Eq. 10 it can be seen that
the critical condition ǫ = 0 requires that KB+N γ2f ′ < 0,
i.e. the passive bundle stiﬀness must be more than com-
pensated by the gating compliance. Negative elasticity
has been measured in hair cells of the bullfrog sacculus
(Martin et al., 2000), and has been interpreted as being

due to gating compliance (Howard and Hudspeth, 1987)
as discussed above.

For small, positive values of ǫ,

the bundle ex-
ecutes small-amplitude limit-cycle oscillations of

quency ωC = √det J. From Eq. 11 it follows that the

Note that the period of oscillation TC is approximately
given by the geometric mean of the two relaxation times,
TC ∼
√τmechτchem. Little is known about the variability
of the calcium relaxation rate λ. If it is constant from cell
to cell, the characteristic frequency is determined only by
the bundle geometry. For the range of bundle sizes found
e.g. in the chick’s cochlea (L = 1.5
50
(Tilney and Saunders, 1983)), the frequency of the short-
est bundles would then be approximately 17 times greater
than the frequency of the tallest bundles. This is some-
what lower than the measured frequency range (about
50 Hz to 5 kHz (Manley et al., 1991)). We note, however,
that to ensure the existence of an oscillatory instability
for all hair cells, ǫ = 0 from Eq. 10 must be fulﬁlled for
each cell. In addition, a strong mismatch between τmech
and τchem would seriously limit the range of amplitudes
for which active ampliﬁcation can be maintained. This
suggests that λ may vary with the geometry of the cell;
τmech.
ideally it would scale as λ
∼
Such variation could be achieved by a diﬀerential level of
expression of calcium pumps or diﬀerent buﬀer concen-
trations. In this case, the range would be enhanced to
cover frequencies diﬀering by a factor of 200. In what fol-
lows, we shall assume that this scaling (which is equiva-
lent to λ
ωC) holds. Note that in contrast to the model
proposed by Choe, Magnasco and Hudspeth (1998) no
variation of transduction channel kinetics is necessary in
order to achieve a broad range of characteristic frequen-
cies. Instead a simultaneous variation of the hair bundle
geometry and the Ca2+ relaxation rate is required.

Critical oscillations

It has been proposed on general theoretical grounds
that the frequency selectivity of hair bundles, as well as
their sensitivity to weak signals, is conferred by their
proximity to a dynamical
instability (Camalet et al.,
2000; Eguiluz et al., 2000). Poised on the verge of os-
cillating at a characteristic frequency ωC, a hair bundle
is especially responsive to periodic disturbances at that
frequency. To ensure robust operation, a control sys-
tem is required which maintains the hair bundle close
to the critical point at which it just begins to vibrate.
The general concept of a self-tuned Hopf bifurcation was
therefore introduced (Camalet et al., 2000), whereby an
appropriate feedback mechanism automatically tunes the
system to the vicinity of the critical point. For the mo-

ment, we will assume that this mechanism works eﬀec-
tively, so that each hair cell is poised at a working point
very close to its critical point, as indicated in Fig. 4.

In the vicinity of the bifurcation the limit cycle can be
described by expanding the equations of motion about
the ﬁxed point as a power series, keeping terms up to
third order. It is convenient to introduce a complex vari-
able

This is the strongly compressive response characteristic

For weak stimuli, it is important to take the eﬀects
of noise into consideration. The buﬀeting of the hair-
bundle by the Brownian motion in the surrounding ﬂuid
will render the spontaneous critical oscillations noisy. In
this regime, signals that yield a response that is smaller
than the spontaneous motion can nevertheless be de-
tected, owing to phase-locking of the noisy oscillations
(Camalet et al., 2000). The ability to detect phase lock-
ing in neural signals despite no increase in the ﬁring rate
has been experimentally conﬁrmed in a number of species
(Narins and Wagner, 1989). In the Appendix we provide
an argument for the threshold of detection which suggests
that for high frequency bundles containing many stere-
ocilia, the smallest wave amplitude that can be detected

Self-tuning mechanism

Sound waves or other vibrations entering the inner ear
cause ﬂow in the ﬂuid surrounding the hair bundles. If
the (unperturbed) ﬂuid motion at the height of the bun-
dle tip has amplitude A and frequency ω, the force ex-
erted on the bundle tip in Eq. 2 is F = Aωζﬂow cos(ωt).

also includes a contribution from shear ﬂow between the

stereocilia. This contribution scales as
is negligible for tall bundles but might become signiﬁcant
for short thick bundles. To preserve generality we write
ζﬂow/ζ = ν, where ν is a constant of order unity which

In order to achieve the combination of frequency se-
lectivity, ampliﬁcation of weak signals and wide dynamic
range, the system has to be tuned to the close proxim-
ity of the Hopf bifurcation (Tr J = 0 in Eq. 10). We
propose that this is accomplished by a feedback control
mechanism which is mediated by the adaptation motors.
The basic requirement is that when the hair bundle is
still, the force exerted by the motors gradually increases
so that they advance up the stereocilia (increasing xM),
pushing the system into the unstable regime (see Fig. 4);
but when the bundle is oscillating, the motor force grad-
ually declines, so that the motors slip back down the
stereocilia, returning the system to the quiescent state.
It would appear that some type of high-pass or band-
pass ﬁlter, which can detect whether or not the bundle
is oscillating, must form an integral part of the feedback
mechanism that controls the motors.

It has long been known that the hair cells of some ver-
tebrates have, in their cell membranes, a system of potas-
sium channels (BK) and voltage-gated calcium channels

that display a resonant response to oscillating input cur-
rents (Hudspeth and Lewis, 1988). It has been suggested
that their purpose is to sharpen the tuning of the signal
passed to the auditory nerve (Crawford and Fettiplace,
1980). It has alternatively been postulated that this sys-
tem may itself generate self-sustained Hopf oscillations
(Ospeck et al., 2001) and could be the basis of active
bundle movement. We put forward a further possibil-
ity: One role of this system of channels is to detect bun-
dle oscillations and to control the adaptation motors via
a ﬂux of calcium ions into the hair bundle (in fact, it
is more likely that the motors are regulated by Ca2+ -
controlled secondary messengers diﬀusing into the hair
bundle, rather than by Ca2+ directly, but this would not
qualitatively alter the following argument).

We model the ﬁltering characteristic of the electrical

oscillator by a Lorentzian transmission function

where V is the receptor potential, RF is a channel resis-
pO is the transduction current. The
tance and Iinput ∝
mechanism operates best if the ﬁlter frequency ωF equals
the characteristic frequency ωC of hair-bundle oscilla-
tions, but this matching has to be encoded genetically
or achieved by some mechanism beyond the scope of our
model. With the value Q
10 measured experimentally
in the bullfrog’s sacculus (Hudspeth and Lewis, 1988),
the ﬁlter distinguishes suﬃciently well between the os-
cillating component of the transduction current and the
underlying background level. The voltage-gated calcium
channels then provide a Ca2+ ﬂux varying (for exam-
ple) exponentially with the membrane potential, which
in turn determines the oﬀset concentration in the stere-
ocilia CB, which appears in Eq. 5. We model it with the
following diﬀerential equation

where the parameters q and VCa describe the voltage sen-

channels’ contribution to the Ca2+ ﬂux in the region close
to the transduction channel, and λB is the relaxation rate
of the Ca2+ current. For the operation of tuning mech-
ωC . The contribution
anism it is essential that λB ≪
of CB is insigniﬁcant when the bundle is quiescent, but
grows rapidly if the bundle starts to oscillate.

The Ca2+ ﬂowing into the bundle from the cell body
regulates the oscillations in two ways. First, it reduces
the control parameter of the bifurcation directly, Eq. 10.
Second, Ca2+ ions binding to the myosin motors enhance
their rate of detachment, via the function g(C) in Eq. 7,
thereby regulating the total force that the team of motors

produces. Here we take g(C)

FIG. 5 Self-tuned critical oscillations.
In the absence of a
stimulus, the bundle performs noisy oscillations with a small
amplitude. A strong external stimulus elicits a response that
can detune the system for some time. Parameters values:
N = 50, KTL = 0.5 pN/nm, KSP = 0.15 pN/nm, ζ = ζﬂow =
0.65 pN ms/nm, γ = 0.14 and A = 40 nm ( the values of other
parameters are listed in the last section of the Appendix ).

stimulus, a bundle executes noisy, self-tuned critical os-
cillations of low amplitude. If a strong stimulus is then
applied, the bundle displays the characteristic response
given by Eq. 20. The signiﬁcant ﬂow of Ca2+ into the cell
elicited by this response detunes the system, so that when
the stimulus is cut, the bundle falls still. Gradually, how-
ever, the motor-mediated self-tuning mechanism returns
the system to its working point, where critical oscilla-
tions just set in, and where the hair bundle’s sensitivity
is maximal.

The hypothesis that the self-tuning mechanism is
based on the detection of oscillations in the transduc-
tion current could be tested experimentally by disabling
the electrical oscillations in the cell body. This could
be done by voltage-clamping the cell or by speciﬁcally
blocking, for example, the voltage-gated calcium chan-
nels. This would disable the self-tuning mechanism and
therefore augment the bundle oscillations. On the other
hand, if the electrical resonance is involved in the gen-
eration of oscillations, disabling it should eliminate the
spontaneous bundle activity.

Slow relaxation oscillations

The self-tuning mechanism described above is suﬃ-
ciently robust to adjust the hair bundle to the critical
point despite the natural variation of conditions that is
likely to occur in vivo. Many experimental

preparations, however, involve signiﬁcant perturbation
from natural conditions, and this may shift the system
into a diﬀerent dynamical regime. In the following, we
consider a particular type of dynamical behavior that can
arise when the calcium feedback is weak. In this situa-
tion, as previously discussed in Fig. 3a, the interaction of
the transduction channels with the calcium ﬂux can pro-
duce a bistable system. If the position xM of the adapta-
tion motors is ﬁxed, the hair bundle will settle at one or

other of the stable positions. However, this state of af-
fairs is upset by the slow calcium feedback acting on the
motors (Eq. 7). Suppose, for example, that the bundle is
at the ﬁxed point with the higher value of x, for which
there is a high probability that the transduction channels
are open. The Ca2+ ions entering through the channel
bind to the motors, causing a fraction of them to detach,
and the diminishing force exerted by the motors causes
the tension in the tip links TTL to fall. As indicated in
Fig. 6a, the ﬁxed point vanishes at a critical value of
TTL, and the system then abruptly jumps to the other
ﬁxed point. At this lower value of x, the channels are
mostly closed. The resulting drop in calcium concentra-
tion augments the number of bound motors, increasing
the tension in the tip links until the lower ﬁxed point be-
comes unstable, whereupon the hair bundle jumps back
to its initial position.

The consequence of this dynamics is a slow relaxation
oscillation (Strogatz, 1994, Sect. 7.5) of the bundle de-
ﬂection X, which has a non-sinusoidal form: each abrupt
jump in position is followed by an interval of slow mo-
tion, as shown in Fig. 6b. Martin, Mehta and Hudspeth
(2000) have observed oscillations of this type in their
preparations of dissected tissue. They attributed the dy-
namical behavior to precisely the motor-mediated mech-
anism that we discuss here, and speculated that these
oscillations form the basis of mechanical ampliﬁcation
of auditory stimuli. According to our model however,
the relaxation oscillations diﬀer in many respects from
the Hopf oscillations which provide active ampliﬁcation.
They are considerably slower; their frequency is strongly
amplitude-dependent; and the frequency does not signif-
icantly depend on the viscous relaxation time of the bun-
dle, but is principally governed by the motors’ sensitivity
to changing calcium levels. In our model, relaxation os-
cillations are an accidental consequence of the self-tuning
mechanism when the system is too far from normal op-
erating conditions.

In the light of our analysis, various interpretations of
the experiment of Martin, Mehta and Hudspeth 2000 are
possible. It may be that in saccular hair cells, which are
designed to detect low frequency vibrations, slow motor-
mediated relaxation oscillators are suﬃcient to provide
a rudimentary ampliﬁcation of signals. Another possi-
bility is that the observed oscillations can be adjusted
to the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation by some mechanism
that we have not considered here, e.g. by alternating
the bundle stiﬀness. A third possibility to bear in mind
is that the conditions in preparations of dissected tissue
are not precisely the same as those in vivo, and thus
the hair bundles may not be operating in the dynami-
cal regime that is physiologically relevant. Careful ad-
justment might permit the channel adaptation and the
motor-mediated self-tuning mechanism to work together
as we propose they do in auditory hair cells, in which case
more rapid, critical Hopf oscillations might be observed.

FIG. 6 Slow relaxation oscillator regime. (a) The solid line
shows the tension-displacement relation for a channel, the
dashed lines the contribution to tension from the passive bun-
dle stiﬀness (which depends on the position of adaptation mo-
tors). In a quasistationary state these two must be equal. For
a given position of the adaptation motors, there can be two
stable solutions. The motors then move the system from one
ﬁxed point to the other. (b) Relaxation oscillations have a
lower frequency than and a diﬀerent shape from the critical
oscillations. To achieve this regime the Ca2+ concentration
outside the bundle was reduced and the self-tuning mech-
anism was replaced by a constant Ca2+ ﬂow from the cell
body.

Conclusion

Our phenomenological model illustrates that the two
adaptation processes which have been documented in
hair cells can, together, generate a self-tuned Hopf bi-
furcation. The feedback mechanism that accomplishes
the self-tuning requires, in addition, a system to detect
bundle oscillations. We have shown that this can be
accomplished by the resonant response of the BK and
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels which has been established
experimentally in lower vertebrates. The spontaneous
frequency ωC of a hair cell is speciﬁed principally by
the architecture of its hair bundle. To ensure robust
operation of a hair cell, we expect that both the cal-
cium relaxation rate λ, and the resonant frequency of
the electrical oscillator are quite closely matched to the
spontaneous oscillation frequency ωC. The self-tuning
mechanism can reliably keep the hair bundle poised on
the verge of oscillating in vivo. But the perturbations in
conditions which can occur in some experimental prepa-
rations may lead to quite diﬀerent dynamical regimes.
Thus, while recent experiments on hair cells of the bull-
frog sacculus show promising signs of active ampliﬁcation

(Martin and Hudspeth, 1999, 2001; Martin et al., 2001,
2000), they may well not yet have revealed the full po-
tential of auditory hair cells to detect faint sounds.

In order to determine the level of the smallest stimulus
that a hair bundle can detect, stochastic ﬂuctuations of
the bundle must be taken into account. There are several
sources of noise in the system. The most important is the
Brownian force that the surrounding ﬂuid exerts on the
bundle. The noise resulting from the stochastic open-
ing and closing of channels is less signiﬁcant, as can be
seen by considering a simpliﬁed two-state channel model.
We denote the lever arm shift between the two states by
d, the average dwell times as τ0 and τ1 and the proba-
bility of ﬁning the channel in state 1 by p1. Then the
expectation value of the number of channels in state 1 is

It can be further simpliﬁed if we replace the “rotat-
ing” noise FN (t)e−iωt (which reﬂects the fact that the
noise only acts on the spatial coordinate and not on
the Ca2+ concentration) with an averaged, homogeneous
noise term. The averaged noise then has the tempera-
ture 1
2 T and Eq. 32 becomes a Langevin equation for a
particle of friction coeﬃcient ζ/γ2, moving in a poten-

Weak stimuli which evoke a response that is smaller
than the stochastic ﬂuctuations of the bundle, never-
theless cause phase-locking of the spontaneous bundle
oscillations (Camalet et al., 2000; Martin and Hudspeth,
2001). The brain might detect such signals through peri-
odicity in the spike-train elicited by individual hair cells,
or via the synchronicity of spikes from neighboring hair
cells, whose characteristic frequencies diﬀer only slightly.
In either case, the quantity of interest is the Fourier
component of bundle oscillations at the sound frequency.

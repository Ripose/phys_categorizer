Abstract

A time series model of CDS sequences in complete genome is proposed. A map of

DNA sequence to integer sequence is given. The correlation dimensions and Hurst

exponents of CDS sequences in complete genome of bacteria are calculated. Using

the average of correlation dimensions, some interesting results are obtained.

1 Introduction

In the past decade or so there has been a ground swell of interest in unraveling the mys-
teries of DNA. With improving of the technique of gene clone and sequences determined,
the DNA sequence data base become huge rapidly. Doing DNA sequence analysis only
use the experimental method does not ﬁt this rapid. Hence it becomes very important to
improve new theoretical methods. One approach that has, in just a few years, proven to
be particularly fruitful in this regard is statistical analysis of DNA sequences[1−9] using
modern statistical measures, including the works on the correlation properties of coding
and noncoding DNA sequences. The second approach is linguistic approach. DNA se-
quence can be seen as analogous at a number of levels to mechanisms of processing other
kinds of languages, such as natural languages and computer languages[10]. Third, using

nonlinear scales method, such as fractal dimension[11, 12, 13], complexity[14, 15]. How-
ever, DNA sequences are more complicated than these types of analysis can describes.
Therefore, it is crucial to develop new tools for analysis with a view toward uncovering
mechanisms used to code other types of information.

Since the ﬁrst complete genome of a free-living bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium was
sequenced in 1995[16], an ever-growing number of complete genomes has been deposited
in public databases. The availability of complete genomes opens the possibility to ask
some global questions on these sequences. Our group also discussed the avoided and
under-represented strings in some bacterial complete genomes[13, 17, 18]. In this paper,
we propose a new model to DNA sequences, i.e. the time series model. First we want
to compute the correlation dimension and Hurst exponents of each CDS sequence in
the complete genome, then consider the distribution of these two quantities on complete
genomes of Bacteria. It is a global problem. Last we want to discuss the classiﬁcation
problem of Bacteria using our results.

For the present purpose, a DNA sequence may be regard as a sequence over the
alphabet {A, C, G, T } representing the four bases from which DNA is assembled, namely
adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. For a DNA sequence, we deﬁne a map f as
following:

f :

A −→ −2
C −→ −1
G −→ 1
T −→ 2.

(1)

Then we obtain an data sequence {xk : k = 1, 2, · · · , N}, where xk ∈ {−2, −1, 1, 2}.
We formal view this sequence as a time series. According to the deﬁnition of f , the four
bases {A, C, G, T } are mapped to four distinct value. One can also use {−2, −1, 1, 2} to
replace {A, G, C, T } or other orders of A, G, C, T . our main aim is distinguish A and G
from purine, C and T from pyrimidine. We expect it to reveal more information than one
dimensional DNA walk[4].

2 Correlation dimension and Hurst exponent

The notion of correlation dimension, introduced by Grassberger and Procaccia[19, 20],
suits well experimental situations, when only a single time series is available, it is now
being used widely in many branches of physical science. Given a sequence of data from a
computer or laboratory experiment

x1, x2, x3, · · · , xN

(2)

where N is a big enough number. These number are usually sampled at an equal time
interval ∆τ . We embed the time series into Rm, choose a time delay τ = p∆τ , then
obtain

yi = (xi, xi+p, xi+2p, · · · , xi+(m−1)p),

i = 1, 2, · · · , Nm

where

Nm = N − (m − 1)p.

In this way we get Nm vectors of embedding space Rm.

For any yi, yj, we deﬁne the distance as

rij = d(yi, yj) =

m−1

X

l=0

|xi+lp − xj+lp|.

(3)

(4)

(5)

If the distance is less than a present number r, we say that these two vectors are correlated.
The correlation integral is deﬁned as

Cm(r) =

1
N 2
m

Nm

X

i,j=1

H(r − rij)

where H is the Heaviside function

H(x) = 


1,
0,

if x > 0
if x ≤ 0

(6)

(7)

For a proper choice of m and not too big a value of r, it has been shown by Grassberger
and Procaccia[20] that the correlation integral Cm(r) behaves like

Thus one can deﬁne correlation dimension as

Cm(r) ∝ rD2(m).

D2 = lim

D2(m) = lim

ln Cm(r)

ln r

.

For more details of D2, the reader can refer to ref.[21].

To deal with practical problem, one usually choose p = 1. From Page 346 of ref.[21],
if we choose an sequence {ri : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} such that r1 < r2 < r3 < · · · < rn, then in the
ln r − ln Cm(r) plane, we can look for a scaling region. Then the slop of the scaling region
is D2(m). When D2(m) dose not change with m increasing, we can take this D2(m0) as
the estimate value of D2. We calculate the correlation dimension of some DNA sequences
using the method introduced above. From the ln r − ln Cm(r) ﬁgures of these sequences
of diﬀerent value of embedding dimension m, we ﬁnd that it is suitable to choose m = 7.
For example, we give the ln r − ln Cm(r) ﬁgure of Phage’s 5’UTR sequence when m = 7, 8

To study time series, Hurst[22] invented a new statistical method — the rescaled range
analysis (R/S analysis), later on B. B. Mandelbrot[23] and J. Feder [24] transplanted R/S
analysis into fractal analysis. For any time series x = {xk}N

Figure 2: An example of R/S analysis of DNA sequence

As n changes from 2 to N, we obtain N − 1 points in ln(n) v.s. ln(R(n)/S(n)) plane.
Then we can calculate Hurst exponent H of DNA sequence s using the least-square linear
ﬁt. As an example, we plot the graph of R/S analysis of an exon segment s of mouse’
DNA sequence (bp 1730– bp 2650 of the record with Accession AF033620 in Genbank)
in Figure 2.

The Hurst exponent is usually used as a measure of complexity. From Page 149 of
Ref.[22], the trajectory of the record is a curve with a fractal dimension D = 2 − H.
Hence a smaller H means a more complex system. When applied to fractional Brownian
motion, if H > 1/2, the system is said to be persistent, which means that if for a given
time period t, the motion is along one direction, then in the succeeding t time, it’s more
likely that the motion will follow the same direction. While for system with H < 1/2, the
opposite holds, that is, antipersistent. But when H = 1/2, the system is Brown motion,
and is random.

3 Data and results.

More than 18 bacterial complete genomes are now available in public databases . There
are four Archaebacteria: Archaeoglobus fulgidus (aful), Pyrococcus horikoshii (pyro),
Methanococcus jannaschii (mjan), and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (mthe);

four Gram-positive Eubacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtub), Mycoplasma pneu-
moniae (mpneu), Mycoplasma genitalium (mgen), and Bacillus subtilis (bsub). The oth-
ers are Gram-negative Eubacteria: one hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus
(aquae); six proteobacteria: Rhizobium sp. NGR234 (pNGR234), Escherichia coli (ecoli),
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (hinf), Helicobacter pylori J99 (hpyl99), Helicobacter pylori 26695
(hpyl) and Rockettsia prowazekii (rpxx); two chlamydia Chlamydia trachomatis (ctra)
and Chlamydia pneumoniae (cpneu), and one cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803
(synecho).

For a given bacterium, we calculate the correlation dimension and Hurst exponent of
each CDS sequence (i.e. the coding sequence) in its complete genome ﬁrst (the results is
shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4), then calculate the average of these two quantities. We
ﬁnd that the average of Hurst exponents of 18 bacteria are almost equal (range being from
0.538 to 0.590). But the diﬀerences among the values of average of correlation dimensions
of these bacteria are larger. One can see Table 1 (from top to bottom, the value of D2

6

become larger).

4 Discussion and conclusions

Although the existence of the archaebacterial urkingdom has been accepted by many
biologists, the classiﬁcation of bacteria is still a matter of controversy[25]. The evolu-
tionary relationship of the three primary kingdoms (i.e. archeabacteria, eubacteria and
eukaryote) is another crucial problem that remains unresolved[25].

From Table 1, we can roughly divide bacteria into two class ﬁrst, the average of D2
of one class is less than 3.0, that of another class is greater than 3.0. We can see that
the classiﬁcation of bacteria using the average of D2 is almost coincide with the original
classiﬁcation of bacteria. Archaebacteria gather with each other except mjan. Gram-
positive bacteria get together except mgen. Chlamydia also gather with each other.
Proteobacteria is divided into two sub-category: rpxx, hpyl, hpyl99 and hinf belong to
one sub-category; pNGR234 and ecoli belong another sub-category.

A surprising feature shown in Table 1 is that Aquifex aeolicus is linked closely with the
Archaebacteria. We noticed that Aquifex, like most Archaebacteria, is hyperthermophilic.
It has previously been shown that Aquifex has close relationship with Archaebacteria from
the gene comparison of an enzyme needed for the synthesis of the amino acid trytophan[26].
Our result, from the comparison of the complete genome, shows that the case is even
more worse. Such strong correlation on the level of complete genome between Aquifex
and Archaebacteria is not easily accounted for by lateral transfer and other accidental
events[26].

We calculate the average of correlation dimensions and Hurst exponents of genes in all
16 chromosome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), they are 3.018 and 0.579 respectively.
From Table 1, one can see that Archaebacteria and Chlamydia are linked more closely
with yeast which belongs to eukaryote than other category of bacteria. There are several
reports (such as Ref.
[27]), in some RNA and protein species, archeabacteria are much
more similar in sequences to eukaryotes than to eubacteria. Our present result supports
this point of view.

We also randomly produce a sequence of length 3000 consisting of symbols from the
alphabet {A, T, G, C}. The correlation dimension is 1.02883. From Table 1, Fig. 3, we
can conclude that all CDS sequences are far from random sequences. Since the Hurst
exponent of random sequence is 0.5. From Fig. 4, we can see that correlation dimension
is well than Hurst exponent when we compare real DNA sequence with a random sequence
on the alphabet {A, T, G, C}.

In Ref.

[14], we ﬁnd the Hurst exponent is a good exponent to distinct diﬀerent

7

functional regions, but now we only consider the same kind of functional region (i.e. they
are all genes), it is reasonable that the average of Hurst exponent do not change much.
Fortunately, now we can use the average of correlation dimension to distinguish diﬀerent
species.

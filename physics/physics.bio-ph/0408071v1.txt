Abstract

Rotational friction on proteins and macromolecules is known to de-
rive contributions from at least two distinct sources – hydrodynamic
(due to viscosity) and dielectric friction (due to polar interactions).
In the existing theoretical approaches, the eﬀect of the latter is taken
into account in an ad hoc manner, by increasing the size of the pro-
tein with the addition of a hydration layer. Here we calculate the
rotational dielectric friction on a protein (ζDF ) by using a generalized
arbitrary charge distribution model (where the charges are obtained
from quantum chemical calculation) and the hydrodynamic friction
with stick boundary condition, (ζ stick
hyd ) by using the sophisticated the-
oretical technique known as tri-axial ellipsoidal method, formulated
by Harding [S. E. Harding, Comp. Biol. Med. 12, 75 (1982)]. The
calculation of hydrodynamic friction is done with only the dry volume
of the protein (no hydration layer). We ﬁnd that the total friction
obtained by summing up ζDF and ζ stick
hyd gives reasonable agreement
with the experimental results, i.e., ζexp ≈ ζDF + ζ stick
hyd .

1 Introduction

In this article, we present an interesting result that the experimentally
observed rotational correlation time of a large number of proteins can
essentially be described as the combined eﬀect of the rotational di-
electric and hydrodynamic frictions on the proteins. Thus, one needs
not assume the existence of a rigid hydration layer around the pro-
tein, as is often assumed in the standard theoretical calculations of
hydrodynamic friction.

The study of rotational friction of proteins in aqueous solution has a
long history [1−12]. Despite many decades of study, several aspects of
the problem remain ill understood. For proteins and macromolecules,
the rotational friction is obtained from Debye-Stokes-Einstein (DSE)
relation given by,

ζR = 8πη R3,

(1)

where ζR is the rotational friction on the protein and R is the radius of
the protein. Naturally, the above relation assumes a spherical shape
of the protein, which is often not correct. Moreover, there is ambigu-
ity about the determination of some average radius of the protein. If
one obtains the radius from the standard mass density of the protein
(0.73 gm/cc), the values of the rotational friction are much smaller.
The dielectric measurement of Grant [4] showed that the experimental
value of rotational friction of myoglobin could only be explained by the
above DSE equation, if one assumes a thick hydration layer around
the protein, thereby increasing the radius of the protein.
It is well
known that spherical approximation embedded in DSE is grossly in
error and the shape of the protein is quite important. However, even
with the more recent sophisticated techniques such as tri-axial ellipsoid
method [5] and the microscopic bead modeling technique [6, 7], which
take due recognition of the non-spherical shape of the macromolecule,
agreement with the experimental result is not possible without the
incorporation of a rigid hydration layer [10]. In should be recognized
that the eﬀect of hydration layer thus introduced is purely ad hoc.
In the case of tri-axial ellipsoidal method, the values of the axes are

2

increased proportionately by increasing the percentage of encapsula-
tion of the protein atoms inside its equivalent ellipsoid [11, 12]. On
the other hand, the microscopic bead modeling technique uses beads
of much bigger size [6] (3.0 ˚A instead of 1.2 ˚A) to take care of the
eﬀect of hydration layer. Without the hydration layer, the estimate of
friction obtained from the theory is systematically lower.

It has been recognized quite early that water in the hydration layer
surrounding proteins and macromolecules has completely diﬀerent dy-
namical properties than those in the bulk [13]. The dynamics of wa-
ter molecules in the hydration layer are also subject of great interest
as they could play crucial role in the property and activity of these
molecules. One often discusses the crossover from biological activity
to the observed inactivity at low temperatures in terms of a protein-
glass transition observed in the hydrated proteins [14]. Recent inves-
tigations have shown that the water molecules in the hydration layer
are not only more structured but they also show slow translational
and rotational motion than their bulk counterpart [15, 16, 17, 18, 19].

Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that water molecules in the sur-
face of a protein such as myoglobin are so slow that we can replace it
by a rigid hydration layer. On the contrary, all the recent experimen-
tal and simulation studies have shown that the water in the surface
of the protein exhibits bimodal dynamics [20]. Majority of the wa-
ter molecules seem to retain their bulk-like dynamics while a fraction
(∼ 20%) exhibits markedly slow dynamics. Recent solvation dynam-
ics and photon echo peak shift experiment not only established the
existence of slow water on the surface of proteins but also showed
that the hydration layer is quite labile [21]. If one deﬁnes an average
residence time to characterize the dynamics of water in the hydration
layer, the residence time of bound or quasi-bound water is expected to
range from 20 to 300 ps [22]. Question naturally arises how to under-
stand quantitatively the role of the hydration layer in enhancing the
rotational friction on the protein molecules. Clearly, the picturesque
description of an immobile rigid layer around protein needs to be re-
placed by a description where the hydration layer is slow but deﬁnitely

3

dynamic.

This labile hydration layer has been explained in terms of a dynamic
exchange model, which assumes that due to the presence of relatively
stronger hydrogen bonding of water molecules with the charged groups
at the surface of the protein, a surface water molecule can exist in
either of the following two states – bound and free [23]. The free
water molecules have dynamical characteristics similar to those of the
bulk but the bound water molecules are essentially made static by the
hydrogen bonding with the surface. In this picture, the slow time scale
arises due to the dynamical exchange between the two states of the
water molecules. Recent computer simulations seem to have conﬁrmed
the essential aspects of the dynamic exchange model (DEM) [24].

While the above model can provide a simple explanation of the
origin of the observed slow dynamics, its correlation with dynamical
properties of protein has not yet been established. This is a non-trivial
problem as discussed below.

The mode coupling theory (MCT) is another viable quantitative
theory, which has been quite successful in describing translational and
rational motion of small molecules [25]. This approach has also been
extended to treat dynamics of polymer and biomolecules [26]. Let us
recall a few of the lessons learned from the MCT of rotational friction
of small molecules, and translational friction of ions in dipolar liquids.
In both the cases, intermolecular dipole-dipole/ion-dipole correlations
were found to play important role.
It was also found that if one
neglects the translational mode of the solvent molecules, then the fric-
tion on polar solute increases by several factors. It should be noted
here that the continuum models/hydrodynamic description of rota-
tional friction always ignored this translational component. In fact,
this translational component plays a hidden role in reducing the eﬀect
of the role of molecular level solute solvent and solvent-solvent pair
(both isotropic and orientational) correlations that increase the value
of the friction over the continuum model prediction. Thus, the issue
is rather involved. In fact, the continuum model is found to give ac-

4

curate results due to cancellation of two errors: neglect of short-range
correlations and neglect of translational contribution. In view of the
above, it is thus important to note that the slow water molecules in
the hydration layer can enhance the friction considerably. Thus, the
classical picture of rigid, static hydration layer needs to be replaced by
dynamic layer where the translational motion of the water molecules
should be related to the residence time. However, only preliminary
progress has been made in this direction. Thus, continuum models
remain the only theoretical method to treat dielectric friction on com-
plex molecules.

An important issue in the calculation of the rotational friction is
that proteins are characterized by complex charge distribution. The
earliest models to estimate the enhanced friction on a probe, due
to the interactions of its polar groups with the surrounding water
molecules in an aqueous solution, employed a point dipole approxi-
mation [27, 28, 29]. In the simplest version of the model, the probe
molecule is replaced by a sphere with a point dipole at the center of the
sphere. Such an approach is reasonable for small molecules, although
continuum model itself may have certain limitations. The situation
is quite diﬀerent for large molecules like proteins because the charge
here is distributed over a large volume and the surface charges are
close to the water molecules. Thus, the point dipole approximation
becomes inapplicable to such systems. This limitation of the early con-
tinuum models was removed by Alavi and Waldeck [30] who obtained
an elegant expression for the dielectric friction on a molecule with ex-
tended arbitrary charge distribution. By studying several well-known
dye molecules, they demonstrated that the extended charge distribu-
tion indeed has a strong eﬀect on the dielectric friction on the probe
molecules. The work of Alavi and Waldeck [30] constitutes an impor-
tant advance in the study of dielectric friction. The role of dielectric
friction has been studied for the organic molecules by other authors
[31].

The objective of the present work is to attempt to replace the rigid
hydration layer used in hydrodynamic calculation. To this goal, we

5

calculate the hydrodynamic friction using the tri-axial method [5], in
which the shape of a protein is mapped to an ellipsoid of three un-
equal axes – closely representing the shape and size of the protein. No
hydration layer is added in the calculation. We then calculate the di-
electric friction using Alavi and Waldeck’s model of generalized charge
distribution for a large number of proteins. The friction contributions
obtained from the above two methods are combined to obtain the total
rotational friction. When compared, the total friction has been found
to agree closely with the experimental result.

We have also extended the work of Alavi and Waldeck to include
multiple shells of water with diﬀerent dielectric constants around a
protein. The multiple shell model is introduced in concern with the
experimental observation of varying dielectric constants of water from
the hydration layer surrounding a protein to the bulk water. These
shells have distinct dielectric properties – both static and dynamic.
The resulting analytical expressions can be used to obtain quantitative
prediction of the eﬀects of a slow layer of water molecules on the
dielectric friction on proteins. However, the multiple shell model in
the continuum fails since it adds up the friction in every layer. This
has been discussed in the appendix.

2 Results and Discussion

Below, we discuss the results obtained from the diﬀerent aspects of
rotational friction of proteins. The coordinates of the proteins are
obtained from protein data bank (PDB) [32].

2.1 Dielectric Friction

Dielectric friction is an important part of rotational friction for polar
or charged molecules in polar solvent, because of the polarization of the

6

solvent medium. The solvent molecules, being polarized by the probe,
create a reaction ﬁled, which opposes the rotation of the probe.

Many of the amino acid residues, which constitute the protein, are
polar or hydrophilic. Therefore, in the aqueous solution, a protein and
other polar molecules experience signiﬁcant dielectric friction. There
exist several theories [27, 28, 29, 33, 34, 35], which account for the
dielectric contribution to the friction. Some of these theories are con-
tinuum model calculation of a point charge or point dipole rotating
within the spherical cavity. Nee and Zwanzig [27] provide an estimate
of dielectric friction on a point dipole in terms of the dipole moment
of the point dipole, dielectric constant of the solvent, Debye relax-
ation time, and the chosen cavity radius. Later, Alavi and Waldeck
[30] extended this theory to incorporate the arbitrary multiple charge
distribution of the probe molecule.

The dielectric friction on the proteins has been calculated from the
expression of Alavi and Waldeck for arbitrary multiple charge distri-
bution model given below [30],

where Rc is the cavity radius, (ri, θi, φi) is the position vector and
qi is the partial charge of the ith atom. P m
l (cos(θi) is the Legendre
polynomial. The maximum value of l used in the Legendre polynomial
ǫs is the static dielectric constant of the solvent. Since the
is 50.
solvent here is water, ǫs is taken to be 78 and the Debye relaxation
time τD is taken as 8.3 picosecond (ps).

The partial charges (qi) of the atoms constituting the proteins have
been calculated using the extended Huckel model of the semi empirical
calculation package of Hyperchem software. The dielectric friction is
calculated on each of the atoms in a protein. The rotational frictions
around X, Y and Z direction are calculated by changing the labels
of the atom coordinates. The average dielectric constant ζ av
DF is the

7

harmonic mean of the dielectric frictions along X, Y and Z direction.
Here X, Y, and Z denote the space ﬁxed Cartesian coordinate of the
proteins, as obtained from PDB [32].

Table 1 shows the values of dielectric friction along X, Y, Z direction
and their average. Continuum calculation method of the dielectric
friction formulated by Alavi and Waldeck is dependent on the cavity
radius and has been discussed in detail by them [30]. They calculated
the cavity radius from the observed orientational relaxation time of
the organic molecules. The ratios of the longest bond vector of the
organic molecules to the cavity radius ranged from 0.75 to 0.85. In
Table 1, the calculation s of dielectric friction are performed using the
cavity radius such that the ratio of the longest bond vector to the
cavity radius is 0.75.

In Table 2, we compared the average dielectric friction for the two

above ratios – 0.75 (denoted as ζ 0.75

DF since the shorter cavity radius will put the
charges close to the surface of the cavity, thereby increasing the polar-
ization of the solvent and hence the rotational friction of the molecule.

2.2 Hydrodynamic Friction

The hydrodynamic rotational friction of the protein depends on its
shape and size. Hydrodynamic friction was estimated earlier by the
well-known DSE relation (Eq. 1). Perrin in 1936 [36] extended the
DSE theory to calculate the hydrodynamic friction for molecules with
prolate and oblate like shapes. Both prolate and oblate have two
unequal axes. Harding [5] further extended the theory to calculate
the hydrodynamic friction using a tri-axial ellipsoid. All the above
theories employ stick binary condition to obtain the hydrodynamic
friction.

Tri-axial ellipsoidal technique requires the construction of an equiv-

8

alent ellipsoid of the protein. We have followed the method of Taylor
et al. to construct an equivalent ellipsoid from the moment matrix
[37]. The eigenvalues of this equivalent ellipsoid are proportional to
the square of the axes. So this method provides with the two axial
ratios. We then obtained the values of the axes using the formula
given by Mittelbach [38]

γ =

(A2 + B2 + C 3)

(3)

Rγ is the radius of gyration and A, B and C are the three unequal
axes of a particular protein.

Once the protein is represented as an ellipsoid with three principle
axes, the hydrodynamic friction is calculated using Harding’s method
[5, 39]. The hydrodynamic rotational friction of the ellipsoidal axes A,
B and C are denoted as ζA, ζB and ζC. The above rotational friction
is obtained from the series of equations given below [39],

The values of hydrodynamic friction, along three principle axes (A,
B and C) of the ellipsoid and their mean, are tabulated in the Table 3.
The A, B and C axes are not the same as the space ﬁxed X, Y, Z Carte-
sian reference frame. Note that the values obtained from the tri-axial
method are much lower than the experimental values. Here, we can
talk about an important aspect of standard hydrodynamic approach
– hydration layer. One ﬁnds that hydrodynamic values of rotational
friction underestimate the rotational friction unless the eﬀect of hy-
dration layer is taken into account. However, the eﬀect of hydration
layer is usually incorporated in an ad hoc manner, by increasing the
percentage of encapsulation of the atoms inside the ellipsoid [12, 11].
In this method, once the two axial ratios are obtained from the equiv-
alent ellipsoid, the actual values of the axes are obtained by increasing
the encapsulation of the protein atoms inside the ellipsoid. In the cal-
culation presented here, the axes are obtained by equating with the
radius of gyration. Therefore, we considered no hydration layer in
this calculation of hydrodynamic friction. Later, we will show that
this eﬀect of hydration layer comes from the dielectric friction.

2.3 Total rotational friction: Comparison with experimen-

tal results

We deﬁne the total rotational friction as the sum of dielectric friction
(ζ av
DF ) and the hydrodynamic friction without the hydration layer (i.e.
tri-axial friction, ζ av

T R) as given below,

ζtotal = ζ av

DF + ζ av
T R

(6)

10

In Table 4, we have shown the values of the average dielectric (ζ av

DF ),
hydrodynamic (ζ av
T R) friction. Total friction (ζtotal) deﬁned above is
shown in the fourth column. To compare with the experimental re-
sults, we have shown the experimental values of the rotational friction
in the next column. Note here, while the total friction, which is the
contribution from both dielectric and hydrodynamic friction, is close
to the experimental result, the microscopic bead modeling predicts
the result, which is close to experimental value by itself [7]. The last
column of Table 4 shows the references of the articles from which the
experimental results are obtained.

The similarity between the total friction and the experimental fric-
tion is shown in ﬁgure 1, where we have plotted the experimental val-
ues of rotational friction against the total friction for a large number
of proteins. For most of the proteins, the results fall on the diagonal
line.

From the results shown in Table 4, we can conclude that the sum
of dielectric friction and the hydrodynamic friction of the dry protein
is approximately equal to the experimental results.

ζtotal ≈ ζexp

(7)

3 Conclusion

Let us ﬁrst summarize the main results of this work. We have cal-
culated the hydrodynamic rotational friction on proteins using the
tri-axial ellipsoid method, formulated by Harding [5], and the dielec-
tric friction using the generalized charge distribution model derived
by Alavi and Waldeck [30]. The hydrodynamic friction is calculated
without the inclusion of any hydration layer. We have found that the
combined eﬀect of dielectric and hydrodynamic friction gives an esti-
mate close to the experimental result. This approach seems to provide

11

a microscopic basis for the standard hydrodynamic approach, where
a hydration layer is added to the protein in an ad hoc manner, to
calculate rotational friction.

The calculations adopted here are still not without limitations. The
continuum calculation of dielectric friction is dependent on the as-
sumed cavity radius. Unfortunately, there is yet no microscopic basis
to assume certain value of the cavity radius for the calculation of di-
electric friction. Moreover, the eﬀect of increasing dielectric constant
of the solvent from the vicinity of the protein to the bulk is not taken
into account by Alavi and Waldeck [30]. Thus, we have attempted
to incorporate a multi shell model to incorporate multiple shells with
varying dielectric constants. The theory is described in the appendix
in detail. The drawback of incorporation of multiple shells in the con-
tinuum is that the frictional contributions from each of the shells add
up, thereby giving rise to an unphysical large result.

Similarly, the tri-axial method and bead modeling method suﬀer
from the lack of microscopic basis to determine the exact values of the
axes and the bead size, respectively.

A potentially powerful approach to the problem is the mode cou-
pling theory [40], which uses the time correlation formalism to obtain
the memory kernel of the rotational friction. The total torque is sep-
arated into two parts – a short range part (which is called the bare
friction Γbare) and a long range dipolar part. The advantage of mode
coupling theory is that it does not depend on any parameter. It uses a
time dependent eﬀective potential ﬁeld in terms of density distribution
and the direct correlation function given by [40],

where, n(r, Ω, t) is the number density of the tagged particle. The

of inertia and the mass of the dipolar molecule, respectively. ΓT (z) is

(12)

(13)

The advantage of the mode coupling approach is that the once the
charge density of the protein molecules and the dipole density of the
water molecules surrounding the protein are deﬁned, the rotational
friction can be obtained in terms of the direct correlation function and
the static and dynamic structure factors of the protein-water systems.
These are again related by Ornstein-Zernike equation [42].

13

The important aspect of this microscopic theory of dielectric fric-
tion is the hidden contribution of the translational modes.
In the
hydration layer, the rotational friction is enhanced due to the slow
translational component. This eﬀect of translation could not be ap-
proached through continuum calculation. Work in this direction is
under progress.

4 Appendix : Multiple shell model and the Draw-

back

Dielectric constant of water varies from the vicinity of the protein to
the bulk water value. To understand the eﬀect of this varying dielectric
constant on the rotational dielectric friction of the protein, we have
performed the continuum calculation of rotational dielectric friction
using a multiple shell model.

Nee and Zwanzig derived the dielectric friction contribution of a
point dipole [27]. Alavi et al. [30] generalized it to obtain dielectric
friction of a molecule with arbitrary distribution of charges. Castner
et al.
[43] generalized the point dipole approach to incorporate the
discrete shell model with varying dielectric constant. Here, we have
combined the approach of Castner et al. and Alavi et al. to obtain a
generalized arbitrary charge distribution model for multiple hydration
layers with varying dielectric constants around the protein. Figure 2
shows the general scheme of this work. The protein is in the innermost
cavity of radius a, where the water has a dielectric constant value of 4.
The dielectric constant of water in the successive layers is assumed to
increase up to the value of the bulk water, having a dielectric constant
of 78. The width of each shell is assumed to be d.

We ﬁrst write down the electrostatic potential in two dimensions,
which could be generalized to three dimensions using principle of su-

14

where, ǫj,j−1 = ǫj/ǫj−1, for all values of j. ǫ0 is the dielectric constant
of the cavity.

Above is the general expression of multiple (n) shell model. To
write the ﬁnal expression of dielectric friction for a two shell model,
we assume Debye relaxation for the frequency dependent dielectric
friction of two shells as given below,

ǫ1,0(mω) = 1 +

ǫ2,1(mω) = 1 +

ǫ1,0 − 1
1 + i mω τD1

ǫ2,1 − 1
1 + i mω τD2

where, τD1 and τD2 are the Debye relaxation time for the ﬁrst and
second shell.

The expression of dielectric friction for a two-shell model is given

below,

The above expression has been numerically evaluated to ﬁnd out
the eﬀect of dielectric friction on protein due to varying dielectric
constant of water around the protein. The multiple shell model is
found to overestimate the dielectric friction, as is evident from the
above expression.

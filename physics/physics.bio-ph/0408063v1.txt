Statistical mechanics of columnar DNA assemblies

Abstract

Many physical systems can be mapped onto solved
or ”solvable” models of magnetism.
In this
work, we have mapped the statistical mechanics
of columnar phases of ideally helical rigid DNA -
subject to the earlier found unusual, frustrated
pair potential
[A. A. Kornyshev, S. Leikin, J.
Chem. Phys. 107, 3656 (1997)] - onto an ex-
otic, unknown variant of the XY model on a ﬁxed
or restructurable lattice. Here the role of the
’spin’ is played by the azimuthal orientation of
the molecules. We have solved this model us-
ing a Hartree-Fock approximation, ground state
calculations, and ﬁnite temperature Monte Carlo
simulations. We have found peculiar spin order
transitions, which may also be accompanied by
positional restructuring, from hexagonal to rhom-
bohedric lattices. Some of these have been exper-
imentally observed in dense columnar aggregates.
Note that DNA columnar phases are of great in-
terest in biophysical research, not only because
they are a useful in vitro tool for the study of
DNA condensation, but also since these structures
have been detected in living matter. Within the
approximations made, our study provides insight
into the statistical mechanics of these systems.

Introduction

DNA molecules in aqueous solution can be condensed into
a variety of phases. As the density of DNA is increased,
transitions occur from an isotropic liquid-like phase to
a liquid crystal phase and ﬁnally to a crystalline struc-
ture [1]. Within these phases, there exist conﬁgurations
with diﬀerent symmetries and molecular arrangements.
For example, X-ray diﬀraction patterns of ﬁbers of dif-
ferent species of alkali metal salts of DNA reveal that
the DNA is crystallized into several diﬀerent lattice types

[2]. Likewise, liquid crystalline mesophases with diﬀer-
ent symmetries, including cholesteric, line hexatic, and/or
hexagonal columnar phases, have been observed over a
wide range of DNA concentrations [1, 3, 4, 5]. These
mesophases are relevant for several reasons – indeed they
are seen in many systems, such as bacteria, viruses, and
mitochondria[6]. Understanding the structure of DNA
aggregates may also aid in understanding the physics of
DNA packing into sperm and phage heads [7] and gene
therapy vesicles [8, 9, 10]. Last but not least, studies of
these structures may shed light on the laws of DNA-DNA
interaction, important, e.g., in the problem of recognition
of homologous genes [11]. As already mentioned, the spe-
ciﬁc phase of a DNA assembly depends heavily on DNA
concentration, but many other factors, such as monova-
lent salt concentration and the eﬀects of polycationic con-
densing agents in the solution, will also greatly inﬂuence
the phase structure for a given DNA density [7, 10]. These
many factors, along with the complex chemical structure
of DNA, complicate theoretical studies of these phases
and the transitions between them. In many studies (see,
for example, Ref. [12]) DNA molecules are treated as uni-
formly charged cylinders since DNA is a polyelectrolyte
that dissociates in solution. This approximation works
well at large interaction distances where counterions may
screen the speciﬁc charge pattern of the DNA surface.
But at the smaller separations where liquid crystalline
structures are observed, a theory of the electrostatic inter-
actions must take into account the discrete helical struc-
ture of DNA. Recent theoretical studies [16, 17, 18] have
demonstrated that a number of phenomena can be ratio-
nalized with the help of such a theory. Indeed, after disso-
ciating in solution, DNA preserves its double helical struc-
ture, with negative charges residing on phosphate strands
and speciﬁcally adsorbing counter-cations settling in the
grooves between the phosphates. This results in a heli-
cal charge separation motif along the DNA surface which
[16]
dictates new interaction laws at close range. Ref.
obtained a solution for the pair potential between helical
macromolecules in parallel alignment, having in particu-
lar revealed that the interaction depends on the relative
azimuthal orientation of the molecules about their long
axes (negative charges on one molecule would like to be

1

closer to the positive charges on the other). Recent work
has shown that this azimuthal dependence yields a rich
phase structure for columnar aggregates and may explain
distortions in the hexagonal columnar phase [20, 22], as
well as a cholesteric to hexatic transition [23]. The ﬁnd-
ings of Ref.
[16] allows a mapping of the pair interac-
tion of DNA onto an XY-spin model of magnetism, al-

consider the eﬀects of temperature on the structure of
columnar phases in order to generate their full statisti-
cal mechanical description. Previous work [20] obtained
ground state conﬁgurations for the columnar phases, but
incorporating temperature eﬀects can change the prop-
erties of the transitions between these phases. Further-
more, they may give rise to more phases associated with
the relative azimuthal orientation of the DNA molecules.
We ﬁrst develop a theory of columnar assemblies ﬁxed
on a hexagonal lattice. We ﬁnd additional Berezinskii-
Kosterlitz-Thouless-like and topologically-related transi-
tions in the ’spin’-structures when including temperature.
Also, for a more complete picture of the columnar assem-
blies, we treat positional restructuring of the molecules
at ﬁnite temperatures. Incorporating spatial degrees of
freedom into a Monte Carlo simulation has yielded new
insight into anomalous spatial correlations in columnar
phases, which may also have relevance for transitions from
columnar to cholesteric phases. These studies reveal lat-
tice types similar to those obtained for the ground state
[20] but great care must be taken due to the limitations
of the interaction potential for certain situations. For
example, at extremely large densities where the DNA is
closely packed, water, speciﬁcally its temperature depen-
dent dielectric constant, can no longer be treated using its
bulk properties as had been done to derive the interaction
potential. Nevertheless, these results can be considered
valid over a wide range of physical parameters and act
as a ﬁrst step to a completely atomistic approach which
may explore a broader range of the physically relevant
parameter space.

The calculation of the pair interaction between two DNA
in parallel juxtaposition [16] regarded DNA as consist-
ing of a double helical charge pattern of negative charges
along the phosphate spine of the DNA and positive
charges adsorbed into the grooves or on the phosphate
strands (see Fig.
1). For identical rigid helices, the
ground state electrostatic interaction energy between two
DNA duplexes of length L is given by

Eint = L [a0 −

a1 cos (φ1 −

φ2) + a2 cos (2 (φ1 −

where the a coeﬃcients depend on a variety of factors such
as the charge distribution on the DNA and the dielectric

properties of the solution, and they decay exponentially
with interaxial spacing between the DNA [16, 25]; for the
most updated version of these expressions, see Appendix
A of Ref. [26]. φi characterizes the azimuthal orientation
of the middle of the minor groove of the i-th molecule
relative to the direction of interaxial separation (Fig. 1).
At large interaxial separations, the a1 term dominates
the a2 term so the ground state energy is minimized
when the two duplexes have the same azimuthal orien-
tations, i.e., their ”spins” look in the same direction,
φ2 = 0. But at separations below the point
φ = φ1 −
= 0
where a1 = 4a2, the energy is minimized when φ
and is degenerate: φ =
φ∗, where φ∗ = arccos [a1/4a2].
In a hexagonal lattice, this gives rise to frustration be-
tween the neighboring spins which results in diﬀerent spin
phases for the ground state, depending on the relative
strength of the a coeﬃcients.

±

Since these electrostatic coeﬃcients decay rapidly for
increased spin separations, we need only consider nearest
neighbor interactions. The spin-dependent term in the
Hamiltonian for a hexagonal phase of rigid DNA frag-
ments of length L is given by the 2D hexagonal lattice
XY model where there is an additional frustration term

To obtain a full phase diagram, we also undertook
Monte Carlo studies of the interaction Hamiltonian, Eq.
(2), on the hexagonal lattice. The MC simulations were
carried out in the standard manner using the Metropolis

algorithm. A lattice site was chosen at random and the
spin at this site was given a new random orientation. The

was accepted. Otherwise, the new spin orientation was
accepted with a probability according to the Boltzmann
∆E/kBT ) where ∆E was the diﬀerence be-
factor exp (
tween the new and old interaction energies. After equili-
bration in the system was reached, successive MC steps
were used to build up the canonical distribution of the
spin conﬁgurations to obtain thermodynamic quantities
such as speciﬁc heat, magnetic susceptibility, etc.

In Fig. 2(a) we display the phase diagram of the sys-
tem in terms of the relative strengths of the a coeﬃcients
and the temperature. Also shown on this phase diagram
is the location of the transition between the Potts and
ferromagnetic states obtained from the analytical expres-
sions of the free energies. The speciﬁc heat for the ratio of
the couplings a2/a1 = 0.6 is shown in Fig. 2(b). The two
peaks correspond to the transitions labeled as the ”TSS
transition” and the ”BKT transition” (deﬁned below) in
the phase diagram.

The BKT-transition corresponds to the standard Bere-
zinskii -Kosterlitz-Thouless transition observed in many
2D spin systems [30]. At this transition, unbinding of the
vortices leads to an abrupt increase of the vortex density,

sum of the spin diﬀerences about a triangular plaquette
in the lattice. Figure 3 exhibits the increase in the vortex
density at this transition.

The peak in Fig. 2(b) found at lower temperatures
stems from the fact that there exist two topologically dis-
tinct ground states [31] of the Potts conﬁguration (see
Fig. 4(a)) akin to that seen in purely antiferromagnetic
spin systems[32]. In Fig. 4(a) the number in the center of
each triangular plaquette corresponds to the positive he-
licity of that triangle, deﬁned as the sum of the clockwise
positive change in the spin angles over 2π as the triangle
is traversed in the clockwise direction (not to be confused
with the vorticity where the angle diﬀerence may have
positive and negative values). This transition is appar-
ent in a plot of staggered, i.e., taking into account only
downward-pointing triangles in the lattice, positive helic-
ity as the temperature changes (see Fig. 4(b)). Domain
walls between these two distinct topologies are excited
destroying the staggered helicity order at this transition,
which we term the topological spin state (TSS) transi-
tion.

Comparisons can be made between the analytical
forms, Eqs. (5)-(8), and the MC simulations to conﬁrm
the validity of the two methods. Speciﬁc heats of the fer-
romagnetic and Potts states can be calculated from the

free energy expressions. For the ferromagnetic state in
the region where 4a2/a1 < 1, there is quite good agree-
ment between the simulations and the analytic forms
(Fig. 5(a)). As expected, deviations occur at higher
temperatures where the HFA breaks down. Agreement
between simulation and the analytical form for the Potts
state, however, is not as good (Fig. 5(b)). Here, the
speciﬁc heat obtained from the MC simulations diverges
from the analytic form at relatively low temperatures.
This discrepancy, as well as the fact that the Hartree
approximation can not account for the phase transition,
can be taken as further indication of the TSS transition.
The Hartree approximation on its own neglects all topo-
logical excitations [33]. Therefore, this diﬀerence starts
being signiﬁcant at relatively low temperatures since do-
main walls may be excited quite easily. Also shown in
Fig. 5(c) is a high temperature expansion of the speciﬁc

Now that we have constructed the phase diagram for
the 2D hexagonal lattice with spin interactions given by
the Hamiltonian of Eq. (2) for generic values of the elec-
trostatic a coeﬃcients, we can use their calculated values
from Ref. [26] to obtain results for ’real’ DNA columnar
phases. Since these coeﬃcients depend on the dielectric
constant of the solution, which is temperature dependent,
the coeﬃcients too depend on temperature. Furthermore,
interactions between DNA pairs are screened by charges
in the solution, and so these coeﬃcients are functions of

and so there is an additional temperature dependence in
the coeﬃcients. Here, e is the electron charge, ns is the
salt concentration, ρ is the 2D DNA density in the colum-
nar assembly, and Z
is the uncompensated DNA charge
(the fraction of the negative phosphate backbone that is
not compensated by readsorbed cations). After ﬁnding
the coeﬃcients over a range of relevant temperatures and
densities for a given charge distribution on the DNA and
salt concentration, we simply map these coeﬃcients onto
the phase diagram of Fig. 2(a) at the corresponding tem-
perature to ﬁnd where the transitions occur.

For ambient conditions at which columnar phases are
observed in vivo or in vitro, the BKT transition would
unlikely be observed. The relative strength of thermal
energy to the interaction energy, which is on the order
of unity at the BKT transition, would engender that ex-
tremely high, physically unviable, temperatures would be
necessary to reach this transition. Rather, instead of go-
ing to high temperatures, the electrostatic interactions
could be weakened, namely by increasing the salt con-
centration or increasing the interaxial distances between
the DNA molecules, so that thermal energies would be
comparable to the interaction energy. But at such low
densities, the DNA would no longer be in a columnar ag-
gregate. Likewise, at large salt concentrations (approxi-
mately ten times that of physiological levels) where this
transition could be seen, the interaction between DNA
would be so weak that we could not assume the DNA are
pinned to the hexagonal lattice sites. In the next section,

On the other hand, the TSS transition may occur at
temperatures, DNA densities, and salt concentrations
where columnar structures are observed in experiments.
At this transition, the electrostatic interaction energy
dominates the thermal energy of the DNA so that the
DNA is essentially immobile within the assembly. In Fig.
6 we show the location of this transition for DNA with
diﬀerent charge compensation, i.e., the fraction of the
negative charge on the DNA phosphate backbone that
is compensated by readsorbed cations, and also diﬀerent
salt concentration in the solution [17]. For all of these
cases, we assumed that 30% of the cations readsorbed
into the minor groove and 70% into the major groove
of the DNA. To obtain this phase diagram, we took the
length of the DNA molecules to be Lp = 50nm, which is
the persistence length of DNA.

We must be careful however since this transition occurs
at relatively small interaxial spacings where the contin-
uum electrostatic theory, which underlies the Hamilto-
nian of Eq. (2), may break down. Although these spac-
ings are quite small, they are close to the Debye screening
length and so the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation
used to derive the interaction [16] may still be valid at
ﬁrst approximation. However, dielectric response of wa-
ter in the conﬁned intracolumnar space may be diﬀerent
than in the bulk: most likely the eﬀective dielectric con-
stant of water will be reduced there. Its variation from
the bulk value will vary with the density of the aggregate.
This would slightly shift the transition to larger interaxial
spacings, because of an increase in the electrostatic inter-
actions between the DNA but would not eliminate this
transition altogether.

mainly by the variation of κ (Eq.(10)) which changes the
balance between the electrostatic coeﬃcients a1 and a2.

3 Positional restructuring of the

assembly

So far, we have assumed that the DNA molecules are
pinned to sites on a hexagonal lattice. However, ther-
mal motion, especially when the interactions grow weaker,
may distort the lattice and, hence, aﬀect the statistical
mechanical properties of the system. Furthermore, de-
pending on the form of the interaction, namely the in-
terplay among the a coeﬃcients, the hexagonal lattice
may not be the optimal ground state of the system. Pre-
vious experimental and theoretical works have demon-
strated that the 2D lattice of a columnar assembly may
be distorted hexatic [4, 22] or, almost equivalently, rhom-
bic [20]. To incorporate these eﬀects, we must modify our
model for the columnar phases of the previous section.

To build up the statistical mechanical theory for colum-
nar assemblies including positional restructuring, the
ground state conﬁguration of the system is ﬁrst obtained
by performing a lattice sum of the interactions among
the DNA molecules in the assembly [20]. Upon carry-
ing out the lattice summation, we ﬁnd that the ground
state conﬁguration for certain values of the electrostatic
coeﬃcients is no longer hexagonal but rather rhombic as
seen in Ref. [20]. For this structure, the spins possess a
quasi-antiferro-magnetic-Ising (QAF) ordering: spins at

60◦). Parallel spins

≥

opposite diagonals of the rhombic cell are the same but
there is a ﬁnite diﬀerence between the spins at adjacent
corners (see Fig. 7). This is quite understandable qual-
itatively: parallel spins will repel each other due to the
frustration-inducing a2 interaction term thus distorting
the hexagonal lattice. The degree of this distortion again
rests on the interplay of the a terms in the interaction.

As before, we have derived an analytical expression for
the free energy for this conﬁguration taking into account
only the six nearest neighbors. Here, however, due to the
distortion, the electrostatic coeﬃcients each take on two
values according to the direction taken along the lattice:
four of the nearest neighbors are at adjacent corners and
the remaining two at the opposite corners along the short
diagonal. Note, that this neglects neighbors across the
long diagonal, but excluding these can be justiﬁed as long
as the distortion angle is not much larger than 60◦, which
is generally the case. The free energy for this state is given

uration at smaller spacings (not shown)], and the ferro-
magnetic hexagonal state is the favorable conﬁguration
above this point. Likewise, for a DNA charge compensa-
tion of 0.7, this transition occurs at a separation of about

lattice types for a couple of diﬀerent charge distributions
on the DNA surface. Incorporating temperature via the
HFA calculation leads to an abrupt ﬁrst order transition
between the QAF rhombic state and the ferromagnetic
hexagonal state, found from comparing the results of Eq.
(5) and Eq. (11). This may well be an artifact of the HFA
calculation [26], but nevertheless, the transition becomes
much sharper as compared to the smoother crossover
found from the ground state lattice sum calculation. This
transition also occurs at a smaller interaxial spacing than
where the ground state lattice sum calculation yields the
crossover between the two states. Including temperature
also alters the amount of the distortion in the rhombic
state, as shown in a plot of ω as a function of average
interaxial spacing in Fig. 9, as compared to that found
from the lattice sum calculations. At very large densi-
ties, the system returns once again to a hexagonal state
with the Potts-type spin conﬁguration. Also, as seen in
Fig. 8, the energy diﬀerence between the hexagonal Potts
conﬁguration and the QAF rhombic state is on the order
of kBT , and so there may be a mixture of these phases
at certain densities. Again, these results are subject to
the limitations of the derived pair interaction at small
interaxial spacings mentioned previously.

culations of the previous section, here, however, a MC
step either corresponds to a change in the spin or a change
in position to probe both spin and spatial degrees of free-
dom. Again, the standard Metropolis algorithm is em-
ployed to build up the canonical distribution of the as-
sembly at a speciﬁed temperature. The new energy is
found by calculating the interactions of the molecule only
with others that lie within a speciﬁed neighborhood of the
original molecule. This is done to increase the eﬃciency
of the simulation and is justiﬁed since the interactions de-
cay quickly with increasing intermolecular distance. From
the simulations, we obtain relevant thermodynamic quan-
tities, upon thermal equilibration of the system, as well as
information concerning spin and positional correlations.
The QAF rhombic to ferromagnetic hexagonal transi-
tion shown in Figs. 8 and 9 also appears in these sim-
ulations at the same average nearest neighbor interax-
ial spacings found from our analytical explorations.
In
Fig. 10, the distribution of the spin diﬀerence between
nearest neighbors is shown for interaxial spacings just
below and above this transition. As shown in this ﬁgure,
the nearest neighbor spin conﬁguration develops from the
two-state QAF phase to a broad single maximum about
zero, the ferromagnetic phase. This is likewise observed
in the spatial distribution between neighbors. Below the
transition, the distribution shows nearest neighbor, next
nearest neighbor, etc. correlations that match a rhom-
bic structure, while above the transition, the distribution
matches that of a hexagonal lattice. Note that just be-
yond this transition at lower densities (at least for the
charge distribution on the DNA used in the simulation
that generated the results of Fig. 10), the DNA precipi-
tates out of solution leaving a coexistence region of DNA
aggregate and DNA-free solution [20].

In order to avoid the situation where DNA condenses
out of solution at lower densities solely due to the choice
of the charge distribution on the DNA, a charge distri-
bution can be used where the interaction energy leads
to a purely repulsive force between molecules. One such
charge distribution is that where there the readsorbed
cations are shared evenly between the major and minor
grooves of the double helix. For this charge distribution,
the interaction energy found by lattice sum calculations
yields a ﬂattening of the potential at intermediate den-
sities that arises due to the spin frustration in the sys-
tem. Due to this ﬂattening, we ﬁnd that as the density is
increased, the spatial correlation function (the probabil-
ity distribution of the location of neighboring molecules,
4πR2g(R) ) becomes more liquid like. Results of the MC
simulation are shown in Fig. 11 demonstrating this eﬀect.
As the density is increased further, of course, the system
once again becomes more crystalline. We essentially ﬁnd
here an eﬀect which could be conventionally called spin-
frustration induced melting of the positional structure of
the columnar aggregate.

Interestingly, this spacing corresponds to that at which a
transition between the columnar phase and the cholesteric
phase is observed in experiments [35, 36]. The transition
between the QAF rhombic and ferromagnetic hexagonal
phases, as shown in Fig. 9 for diﬀerent charge distribu-
tions, correspondingly occurs at this same spacing for this
DNA charge distribution. As the interaxial spacing in-
creases, these correlations decay to zero as a result of the
overall weakening of the interactions between molecules
at smaller densities, which leads to an isotropic liquid
phase.

4 Discussion

We have presented results of a statistical mechanical anal-
ysis of DNA in columnar assemblies that interact via an
azimuthal angle (’spin’) dependent pair potential [16].
Initially, we assumed that DNA is packed in a ﬁxed two
dimensional hexagonal structure so that we had to con-
sider only ’spin-spin’ interactions between neighboring

molecules. Hence, tools similar to those used for studying
magnetic systems could be employed. Again, this spin in-
teraction arises from the helical charge distribution on the
double helix. Due to a quasi-antiferromagnetic coupling
term in the interaction, the system may be frustrated,
which gives rise to a rich phase structure.

Besides a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type transi-
tion and an intermediate transition to a ferromagnetic-
like state, we have found a transition associated with do-
main formation of two distinct topologies of the spin sys-
tem. Comparing biologically relevant values of the spin
coupling terms to the generic phase diagram of the hexag-
onal system, we ﬁnd that this latter transition may be
experimentally probed in dense assemblies. Calorimetric
measurements would seem to be the simplest option to
study this transition, but other experimental factors may
inhibit a direct measurement of the transition in this man-
ner. X-ray diﬀraction [4] or NMR [35] techniques, how-
ever, may be able to directly scrutinize the spin structure
within the assembly to obtain the spin correlations in the
system thus providing evidence if such a transition ex-
ists.
Investigations are currently being pursued by our
experimental collaborators at Imperial.

Extending the theory, we considered non-hexagonal lat-
tice types and also incorporated thermally-induced posi-
tional ﬂuctuations of the molecules. Previous studies of
DNA assemblies [20] demonstrated that a 2D rhombic
(distorted hexagonal) lattice would be the ground state
conﬁguration of the system under certain conditions. We
found from both analytical and numerical investigations
a ﬁrst order transition from this quasi-antiferromagnetic
rhombic state to a hexagonal ferromagnetic state as the
density of DNA in the system decreases. Likewise, this
transition also appears in the probability distribution of

the nearest neighbor phase angle diﬀerence of the MC
simulations. The ensemble average of nearest neighbor
spin diﬀerences develops from a two-state spin system to
one with a single maximum.

Furthermore, these MC simulations revealed other in-
teresting phenomena. For certain distributions of ad-
sorbed cations on the DNA surface, we found that in-
creasing the DNA density lead to a counterintuitive re-
duction in the crystalline ordering of the system so that
the system became more liquid like. This has been ob-
served in classical experiments[4] of densely packed DNA
at roughly the same interaxial spacings as those found
in our simulations. Again, this results from the frustra-
tion in the spin interaction between the molecules. Also,
in this same system, we found that the behavior of bi-
axial correlations between neighboring molecules, which
has been proposed as a mechanism underlying the for-
mation of cholesteric phases [23] at densities lower than
those of the columnar phases, is inﬂuenced by the tran-
sition between the quasi-antiferromagnetic rhombic and
ferromagnetic hexagonal phases. This occurs at interax-
ial spacings where the transition between columnar and
cholesteric phases are observed in experiments. As the
density of the DNA-assembly is further decreased, the in-
termolecular interactions would grow ever weaker, until,
ﬁnally, thermal motion would destroy any lattice order-
ing in the system. At this point, the lattice would then
completely melt into a liquid-like isotropic phase [37].

Throughout this paper we have used a 2D model to de-
scribe interactions between DNA. In three dimensions, as
well as azimuthal angular ﬂuctuations, there exist ﬂuctu-
ations of the relative positions of the molecules along their
long axes. If the charge distribution of the DNA surface is
taken as continuous, then these two types of ﬂuctuations
are indistinguishable in the roles they play in the interac-
tion energy, i.e., an azimuthal rotation is equivalent to a
translation along the long axis. For this case, we may sim-
ply replace the azimuthal coordinate φ by the coordinate
˜φ = φ
2πz/H in all our expressions, which would not
alter our present results. However, if we consider that the
charges on the DNA surface are discrete, this equivalence
will be lost; there will be additional interactions which de-
stroy this symmetry. Nevertheless, if the assemblies are
not extremely dense, these additional interactions due to
discreteness can be neglected and the charge pattern on
the DNA can be considered to be continuous. Still, dis-
creteness will restrict the corkscrew motion ( ˜φ = 0) of
DNA, which costs no energy for a continuous charge dis-
tribution, within the assemblies.

We must caution once again that the form of the DNA-
DNA interaction [16] we have employed is subject to cer-
tain limitations. As the concentration of DNA in the
solution is increased, so that the surface-to-surface sep-
aration becomes prohibitively small, eﬀects of nonlocal
polarizability of the water in the narrow interstitial re-

gions between the DNA could alter the results [38]. Fur-
thermore, dielectric saturation and sterical constraints
threaten to freeze the dielectric response of strongly con-
ﬁned water. Likewise, at such large densities, steric forces
between DNA mediated by conﬁned water may need to
be also included in the interaction. Also, the pair po-
tential was derived using a linearized Poisson-Boltzmann
equation which is valid for weak electric ﬁelds in solu-
tion, and thus the pair potential may not be valid when
the electrostatic interactions are quite substantial (large
densities). Next, as the DNA concentration is altered or
the DNA move about, rearrangement or additional ad-
sorption/desorption of cations on the DNA surface may
occur in response to a change in intermolecular distances
[34], thus aﬀecting the pair interaction. Last but not
least, in this study DNA duplexes have been considered
as ideally helical: sequence dependent distortions from an
ideal double helical step structure of DNA [25] has been
neglected here as well as the torsional elasticity of the du-
plexes, that in columnar aggregates can correct the non-
ideality [26, 28, 39]. Nevertheless, this is a ﬁrst step to
rationalize the columnar systems at ﬁnite temperatures
before treating them with a computationally expensive
fully atomistic approach in which these results may be
tested.

E[φ(~k)]we need three types of diagrams (or vertices) to
represent each ϕn- term in this expansion, for n > 2 . For
illustration some of the diagrams are shown in Fig. 14.

Then, we may write down graphs to describe each term
in our expansion. Each graph will contain NV vertices,
which are all connected to each other by lines. We assign a
label i = 1 . . . NV to each vertex. For each vertex i, repre-

The zeroth order term in the series corresponds to G0 .
The ﬁrst order term corresponds to the ϕ4 vertex, the
second order term to the ϕ6 vertex and so on. For cτ we
ﬁnd the following expression:

cτ =

(A15)

From this we may show that cτ = 1/3 and M1 = M2 =
M3 = m1. The next step is to go back to Fig. 15 and re-
place G0 in each loop with G1, where G1 will be replaced
on the l.h.s. of this expression with a new correlation
function G2. On summing these graphs we ﬁnd Eq. (A13)
(G1 replaced by G2), but with M1 = M2 = M3 = m1

We then keep iterating this process until we have J =
m∞ = m∞−1 and so obtain Eq. (6) of the text.

To calculate the free energy we must consider the sum
of graphs (Fig. 16). For the free energy in the Hartree ap-
proximation we take care in replacing m0 with J, renor-
malizing our expansion, thus obtaining Eq.

Figure 14: a.) represents all three types of vertices for the
ϕ4 term in the expansion for Eanh . Shown, here, are the
four wave vectors associated with each ϕ4 vertex. Also,
we write an index τ = 1, 2, 3 which distinguishes between
these three types. In the corresponding expression there is
a particular form factor associated with each of the three
types of vertex we may draw (see text). b.) represents
all three types of vertices for the ϕ6 term.
In general,
a vertex for the ϕn term is obtained by drawing a point
with lines radiating from it. See text for a full discussion.

spectively. Each full Feynman graph will also consist of
NE external lines (connected to only one vertex) each
associated with a wave vector ~qj, (j = 1, . . . , NE). For
each of these external lines we write down G(~qj) and set
m = ~qj for one of the ~ki
~ki
m in the vertex to which the
line is connected. There will also be NI internal lines,
each associated with a wave vector ~pk, (k = 1, . . . , NI ),
where each end is connected to two vertices, i and i′. For
each of these internal lines we write down G(~pk) and set
~ki
m = ~ki
m in each of the two ver-
tices. Then all the wave vectors for the internal lines are
summed over. Last of all, there is also a symmetry factor
that multiplies this, which accounts for how many ways
a term (graph) in the expansion may be generated.

Again, let us consider Gaussian ﬂuctuations and so dis-
card all anharmonic terms. ∆φ′
boundary is the diﬀerence in
φ′ (ﬂuctuations in φ) between one part of the boundary
and another part of the boundary of our lattice, which
cannot be neglected. We can think of the coeﬃcient that
multiplies ∆φ′
boundary as a net torque, which is non zero
when the system is out of equilibrium. At equilibrium,
therefore, we require that, for the ∆φ′
boundary term to

replace G0 in each loop with G1, and replace G1 on the

Each term in this series can be represented diagrammat-

Eq. (B14) should be renormalized by replacing ˜m0,1 with
J1 and β with α, and so replacing G0 by G∞ in each of
the loops. For Eq. (B13) to be satisﬁed we require that

For the QAF state on a hexagonal lattice close to T = 0,

from Eq. (B5) it follows that β
this is that c1(β) and c2(β) are complex unless β =
1/2
(at a1/4a2 = 1), and the QAF state at T = 0 is unstable.
Therefore it cannot be a ground state except at the point
of frustration. At T
= 0 we ﬁnd that thermal ﬂuctuations
can stabilize the QAF state. However, this state always
has a higher free energy than either the Potts or ferro-
magnetic states, so will not be a phase of the system at
thermal equilibrium.

φ1,j,l = ˆφ1,j,l, φ2,j,l = ψ + ˆφ2,j,l and φ3,j,l = 2ψ + ˆφ3,j,l.
The expressions we get are cumbersome and we shall not
write them down. For brevity’s sake, in what follows we
shall only give an outline of the derivation and only state
key results.

The next step is to separate E into a Gaussian (E0)
and anharmonic part (Eanh) in the same way as we did
for the other states. We may Fourier transform these to
reciprocal space using relations similar to Eq. (A4). Here
we state a key result, that

2 , ˜m1,1,
˜m1,2, ˜m2,1 and ˜m2,2, respectively. On further iteration (as
described in previous appendices), we obtain Eqs. (8a)
and (8b). Again we have used Pad´e approximants for
η1(β) and η2(β).

In order to obtain the free energy again, we must con-
sider the sum of graphs shown in Fig. 16, but with each
G0 a matrix. Then we replace ˜m0,1 with J1 and ˜m0,2 with
J2, obtaining Eq. 8 with

˜Ωpotts(α) =

Γ(~k, ψ) is now a matrix, and is determined by ﬁrst con-
sidering the graphs shown in Fig. 17 (where G0 is also a
matrix) and then replacing ˜m0,1 with J1 and β with α .
This enables us to derive Eq. (8c) of the text.

[31] There are 6 distinct topological ground states cor-
responding to the broken symmetries of the Potts
state. 3 states are got through translations of the
lattice the other three are got by changing the stag-
gered helicity (deﬁned later in the text). However,
what seems to matter in this transition is change in
staggered helicity

[33] Unfortunately, including topological excitations in a
systematic manner is involved and diﬃcult process.
Indeed, in the pure XY model vortices have been
included in analytical calculations [S. Ami and H.
Kleinert Phys. Rev. B 33, 4692 (1986)]. These calcu-
lations are complicated, but do lead to good agree-
ment from zero temperature right up to the BKT
transition. However, we have decided that, since this
is a ﬁrst time study, a theoretical treatment includ-
ing topological excitations is beyond the scope of this
present work

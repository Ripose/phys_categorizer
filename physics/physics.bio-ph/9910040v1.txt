Abstract

A representation of frequency of strings of length K in complete genomes of many organisms
in a square has led to seemingly self-similar patterns when K increases. These patterns are
caused by under-represented strings with a certain “tag”-string and they deﬁne some fractals in
the K
limit. The Box and Hausdorﬀ dimensions of the limit set are discussed. Although
the method proposed by Mauldin and Williams to calculate Box and Hausdorﬀ dimension is
valid in our case, a diﬀerent and sampler method is proposed in this paper.

1 Introduction

In the past decade or so there has been a ground swell of interest in unraveling the mysteries
of DNA. The heredity information of organisms (except for so-called RNA-viruses) is encoded in
their DNA sequence which is a one-dimensional unbranched polymer made of four diﬀerent kinds
of monomers (nucleotides): adenine (a), cytosine (c), guanine (g), and thymine (t). As long as the
encoded information is concerned we can ignore the fact that DNA exists as a double helix of two
“conjugated” strands and only treat it as a one-dimensional symbolic sequence made of the four
letters from the alphabet Σ =
. Since the ﬁrst complete genome of a free-living bacterium
}
Mycoplasma genitalium was sequenced in 1995[3], an ever-growing number of complete genomes has
been deposited in public databases. The availability of complete genomes opens the possibility to
ask some global questions on these sequences. One of the simplest conceivable questions consists in
checking whether there are short strings of letters that are absent or under-represented in a complete
genome. The answer is in the aﬃrmative and the fact may have some biological meaning[5].

a, c, g, t
{

The reason why we are interested in absent or under-represented strings is twofold. First of all,
this is a question that can be asked only nowadays when complete genomes are at our disposal.

∗This work was partially supported by Chinese Natural Science Foundation and Chinese Postdoctoral Science

Foundation.

Second, the question makes sense as one can derive a factorizable language from a complete genome
which would be entirely deﬁned by the set of forbidden words.

We start by considering how to visualize the avoided and under-represented strings in a bacterial

genome whose length is usually the order of a million letters.

Bai-lin Hao [5] et al. proposed a simple visualization method based on counting and coase-
graining the frequency of appearance of strings of a given length. When applying the method to
all known complete genomes, fractal-like patterns emerge. The fractal dimensions are basic and
important quantities to characterize the fractal. One will naturally ask the question: what are the
fractal dimensions of the fractals rerlated to languages deﬁned by tagged strings? In this paper we
will answer the question.

2 Graphical representation of counters

We call any string made of K letters from the set

a K-string. For a given K there are
in total 4K diﬀerent K-strings. In order to count the number of each kind of K-strings in a given
DNA sequence 4K counters are needed. These counters may be arranged as a 2K
2K square, as
shown in Fig. 1 for K = 1 to 3.

where si ∈ {
described by a color code biased towards small counts, each bacterial genome shows a distinctive
pattern which indicates on absent or under-represented strings of certain types[5]. For example,
many bacteria avoid strings containing the string ctag. Any string that contains ctag as a substring
will be called a ctag-tagged string. If we mark all ctag-tagged strings in frames of diﬀerent K, we
get pictures as shown in Fig. 2. The large scale structure of these pictures persists but more details
appear with growing K. Excluding the area occupied by these tagged strings, one gets a fractal F
in the K

limit. It is natural to ask what are the fractal dimensions of F for a given tag.

In fact, this is the dimension of the complementary set of the tagged strings. The simplest case
is that of g-tagged strings. As the pattern has an apparently self-similar structure the dimension

3

is easily calculated to be

dimH(F ) = dimB(F ) =

log 3
log 2

,

where dimH(F ) and dimB(F ) are the Hausdorﬀ and Box dimensions[2] of F .

In formal language theory, we starts with alphabet Σ =

. Let Σ∗ denotes the collection
}
of all possible strings made of letters from Σ, including the empty string ǫ. We call any subset
Σ∗ a language over the alphabet Σ. Any string over Σ is called a word. If we denote the given
L
tag as w0, for our case,

a, c, g, t
{

⊂

L =

word which does not contain w0 as factor
{

.
}

F is called the fractal related to language L.

3 Box dimension of fractals

When we discuss the Box dimension, we can consider more general case, i.e. the case of more
than one tag. We denote the set of tags as B, and assume that there has not one element being
factor of any other element in B. We deﬁne

L1 =

word which does not contain any of element of B as factor
{

}

Now let aK be the number of all strings of length K that belong to language L1. As the linear

size δK in the K-frame is 1/2K , the Box dimension of F may be calculated as:

dimB(F ) = lim
K→∞

log aK
log δK

−

= lim
K→∞

1/K

log aK
log 2

.

Now we deﬁne the generating function of aK as

f (s) =

aK sK,

∞

XK=0

where s is a complex variable.

First L1 is a dynamic language, form Theorem 2.5.2 of ref.[10], we have

From (1), we have

lim

dimB(F ) =

log l

For any word w = w1w2 . . . wn, wi ∈

Σ for i = 1, . . . , n, we denote

Head(w) =

T ail(w) =

For given two words u and v, we denote overlap(u, v) = T ail(u)
we can write v = xx′. We denote x′ = v/x and deﬁne

Head(v). If x

Head(v), then

Hence

4 Hausdorﬀ dimension of fractals

We obtained the Box dimension of F in the previous section. Now one will naturally ask whether
the Hausdorﬀ dimension of F equals to the Box dimension of it. In this section we will discuss the
Hausdorﬀ dimension of F . Now we only discuss the case of B contains only one word w0. From
the K-frames (K =

+ 1, . . .), we can ﬁnd:

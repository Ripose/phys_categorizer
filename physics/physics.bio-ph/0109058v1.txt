Abstract: We study the accumulation of delete-
rious mutations in a haploid, asexually reproducing
population, using analytical models and computer
simulations. We ﬁnd that Muller’s ratchet can come
to a halt in small populations as a consequence of
a ﬁnite genome size only, in the complete absence
of backward or compensatory mutations, epistasis,
or recombination. The origin of this eﬀect lies in
the fact that the number of loci at which mutations
can create considerable damage decreases with every
turn of the ratchet, while the total number of muta-
tions per genome and generation remains constant.
Whether the ratchet will come to a halt eventually
depends on the ratio of the per-locus deleterious
mutation rate u and the selection strength s. For
suﬃciently small u/s, the ratchet halts after only a
few clicks. We discuss the implications of our results
for bacterial and virus evolution.

A major evolutionary pressure that distinguishes ﬁ-
nite asexual from sexual populations experience is
Muller’s ratchet, i.e., the continual loss of those indi-
viduals from the population that carry the smallest
load of mutations (Muller 1964; Felsenstein 1974).
Sexual populations can regenerate individuals with
reduced number of mutations through recombina-
tion, while asexual populations cannot. This may
be one of the main advantages of sexual recombina-
tion (Felsenstein 1974; Maynard Smith 1978; Taka-
hata 82; Pamilo et al. 1987; Antezana and Hud-
son 1997). Besides its importance for theories of the
evolution and maintainance of sex, Muller’s ratchet

may also play a signiﬁcant role in bacterial or vi-
ral dynamics, where host to host transmission of-
ten creates severe bottlenecks (Chao 1990; Andersson
and Hughes 1996). Conventional wisdom says that
Muller’s ratchet proceeds at a constant rate, as a re-
sult of which an asexual population may eventually
go extinct (Lynch and Gabriel 1990; Gabriel et al.
1993). The main assumptions that enter the classic
ratchet model are a vanishing probability of back mu-
tations, a genome with an inﬁnite number of loci, and
mutations that do not interact. When epistatic inter-
actions are taken into account, Muller’s ratchet will
slow down over time (Charlesworth et al. 1993; Kon-
drashov 1994), though it will not necessarily come to
a halt (Butcher 1995). On the other hand, if back mu-
tations are assumed to be frequent and the genome
is ﬁnite, then the ratcheting process will always stop
eventually, even in the absence of epistatic interac-
tions (Woodcock and Higgs 1996; Pr¨ugel-Bennett
1997). A similar result can be found if there is
suﬃcient supply of compensatory mutations (Wag-
ner and Gabriel 1990). However, since the majority
of studies focuses on the classic model with inﬁnite
genome (Haigh 1978; Pamilo et al. 1987; Stephan
et al.
1993; Higgs and Woodcock 1995; Gessler
1995; Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1997; Gordo
and Charlesworth 2000a; Gordo and Charlesworth
2000b), it is not entirely clear how Muller’s ratchet
aﬀects bacteria or viruses, which contain at most a
couple of hundred genes.

Here, we investigate the selection-mutation balance
for a ﬁnite number of loci, and we also consider ar-
bitrary forward and back mutation rates. Perhaps
not so surprisingly, we ﬁnd that if the back mutation
rate is small but non-zero, selection-mutation balance
stabilizes the population before the genome is com-

1

pletely deteriorated. More importantly, however, the
assumption of a ﬁnite number of loci alone guarantees
that even in the complete absence of back mutations,
Muller’s ratchet can come to a complete halt within
a biologically relevant time frame if selection is suﬃ-
ciently strong.

Infinite population size

As in the case of an inﬁnitely long genome, the de-
terministic mutation-selection balance of an inﬁnite
population is a useful basis for the subsequent anal-
ysis of ﬁnite population eﬀects (Haigh 1978). We
therefore give a brief treatment of the inﬁnite popu-
lation case, and discuss the inﬂuence of various rates
of back mutations on the equilibrium distribution of
deleterious mutations.

The deterministic mutation-selection equilibrium
can be calculated straightforwardly from the eigen-
vector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the
transition matrix W (Eigen et al. 1988). The tran-
sition matrix contains the rates at which genotypes
are produced as oﬀspring of other genotypes, i.e., an
entry wij in the transition matrix is given by the ﬁt-
ness of genotype j times the probability that geno-
type j mutates into genotype i. In the present case,
the analysis can be simpliﬁed because we disregard
epistatic interactions, in which case it is suﬃcient to
calculate the equilibrium point for a single locus. The
generalization to a ﬁnite number of loci L is trivial
(Rumschitzki 1987).

We assume a single locus with two alleles, ’+’ and
’−’. The ’+’ allele carries a ﬁtness of 1, and the ’−’
allele carries a ﬁtness of 1 − s. Mutations from ’+’
to ’−’ may occur with a rate u per locus. We call
these mutations forward (or deleterious) mutations.
Conversely, mutations from ’−’ to ’+’ occur with a
rate v, and we call these mutations back mutations.
The transition matrix for this single-locus, two-allele
model is given by

W =

1 − u
u

(cid:18)

(1 − s)v
(1 − s)(1 − v)(cid:19)

.

(1)

The concentration of the ’+’ allele is correspondingly
1 − a. In the case of L loci, this result generalizes to

xk =

L
k(cid:19)

(cid:18)

ak(1 − a)L−k ,

(3)

where xk is the concentration of genomes that carry
k alleles of the ’−’ type (we will in the following sim-
ply say that these genomes carry k mutations). From
(3), the average number of mutations hki in the pop-
ulation follows as hki = aL.

If we set the back mutation rate to v = 0, we ﬁnd

the simple expression

hki
L

= a =

1

for u > s
u/s for u ≤ s.

(cid:26)

(4)

We learn that the fate of an inﬁnite population with-
out back mutations is determined by the ratio be-
tween the rate of deleterious mutations per locus u
and the selection strength s. When u is of the order
of s or larger, then hki = L, which means that the
population will eventually consist exclusively of indi-
viduals that have been hit by mutations at all loci.
For u smaller than s, on the other hand, the majority
of individuals in the population will accumulate only
a small number of mutations.

In Fig. 1, we show the average fraction of mutated
loci in the population, hki/L, as a function of the
forward mutation rate u and for various back muta-
tion rates v. Note the sharpness of the transition at
u/s = 1. If u is only a factor of 10 smaller than s,
then on average each individual carries mutations in
only 10% of the loci. We observe further that the
ratio of u/s plays a more important role in determin-
ing the equilibrium point of the population than the
back mutation rate v. Unless v is of the order of u,
the deviations from the case of v = 0 are small.

It is worth mentioning that if we substitute a = u/s
into (3) and take the limit L → ∞ while keeping the
genomic mutation rate U = uL constant, we recover
the Poisson distribution of mutants that is normally
assumed in models of Muller’s ratchet with inﬁnite
genome size (Haigh 1978).

From diagonalization, we ﬁnd that the ’−’ allele is
present in the population at a concentration of

Simulation methods
All simulation results reported in this work were ob-
tained in the following manner. We keep track of

2

L + 1 variables ni, each of which counts the number
of individuals with i mutations currently present in
the population. In order to propagate the population
through one round of selection and mutation, we cre-
ate a new set of variables ni(t+1) from the current set
ni(t). Initially, all ni(t + 1) are set to zero. We then
repeat the following steps N times: We choose a mu-
tation class i at random for replication, according to
probabilities pi that are proportional to (1 − s)ini(t).
We then test i times for backward mutations, with
probability v, and L − i times for forward mutations,
with probability u. The mutation class j of the new
individual is then i minus the successful back muta-
tions plus the new forward mutations. The variable
nj(t + 1) is correspondingly incremented by one. Af-
ter N repetitions of these steps, we have fully assem-
bled the population of time t + 1, and we begin again
with a new set of variables ni(t + 2), and so on. The
distribution at t = 0 is always n0(0) = N , ni(0) = 0
for all i > 0.

Moment expansion
For the case of an inﬁnite population, we have seen
that no signiﬁcant accumulation of mutations occurs
if the selective strength is larger than the per-locus
deleterious mutation rate. No back mutations are
necessary to maintain this balance between selection
and mutation in an inﬁnite population, because the
wild type (with all loci carrying the ’+’ allele) is
never lost. The equilibrium point is then simply a
function of the rate at which mutants are produced
from the wild type, and the rate at which the wild
type replicates in comparison to the replication rate
of the mutants. The case of a ﬁnite population is fun-
damentally diﬀerent, because there the least loaded
class can be lost.

We have calculated the average number of mu-
tations in a population using a moment expansion
technique previously used by Woodcock and Higgs
(1996).
In essence, we have repeated their calcu-
lations, but have keept the forward and the back-
ward mutation rates independent, instead of assum-
ing u = v. The details of these calculations are given
in the Appendix.

We compared our analytical result with numeri-
cal simulations. We found that our approximations
worked well for selective values s of the order of u or
smaller (Fig. 2), but did not give a reasonable esti-

mate when s > u. This is not too surprising, given
that the calculations are done under the assumption
that s is small. Unfortunately, however, the interest-
ing parameter region is s > u, for which the inﬁnite
population model allows for a non-trivial equilibrium
even in the absence of back mutations. We therefore
had to develop an alternative analytical description
that would be more suitable for s > u.

Eﬀective genome size model
In this section, we focus on the case of no back mu-
tations, v = 0. From a mathematical point of view,
a ﬁnite population without back mutations will al-
ways hit the absorbing boundary at hki = L even-
tually, i.e., it will always lose all ’+’ alleles as time
t → ∞. Therefore, we know that any set of equations
aimed at ﬁnding the true equilibrium point of such
a system is bound to yield hki = L. However, this
solution has no biological signiﬁcance if the waiting
time to arrive at hki = L is extremely large, e.g., of
the order of millions of generations or larger. Con-
sequently, we must try to ﬁnd a description for the
increase in waiting times between successive clicks,
and may assume that the ratchet has stopped once
the waiting times exceed a biologically relevant time
scale. Below follows a mathematical description for
the waiting times that, while being too simplistic to
yield accurate quantitative results for very small N ,
describes well the qualitative behavior that we see in
simulations, and gives valuable insight into the na-
ture of Muller’s ratchet in ﬁnite genomes.

We assume that the number of sequences in the
least loaded class n0 is given by the inﬁnite popula-
tion concentration times the population size N , and
that loss of the least loaded class occurs if all indi-
viduals in that class do either fail to reproduce or
give birth to mutated oﬀspring. The situation of a
population with a least loaded class having kmin mu-
tations is equivalent to one in which the least loaded
class has zero mutations, but the genome is of length
L − kmin.
In the following, we will therefore refer
to L − kmin as the eﬀective genome size, and to the
model that we describe now as the “eﬀective genome
size model”.

From (3), we ﬁnd

n0 = N (1 − a)L−kmin
≈ N ea(kmin−L) .

(5a)

(5b)

3

The probability ξ that an organism in the next gen-
eration is an oﬀspring of one of the n0 organisms in
the least loaded class is given by [with xi as deﬁned
in (3)]

ξ =

(n0/N )(1 − s)kmin
L
i=kmin xi (1 − s)i

.

P

(6)

The probability that there will be j descendants of
the least loaded class in the next generation can be
expressed in terms of ξ as

pbirth(j) =

N
j (cid:19)

(cid:18)

ξj(1 − ξ)N −j .

(7)

The probability that all these j organisms carry at
least one additional mutation is given by
pmut(j) = [1 − (1 − u)L−kmin]j .

(8)

The total probability of a ratchet event then follows
as

pratchet =

pmut(j)pbirth(j)

N

Xj=0

= [1 − ξ(1 − u)L−kmin]N
≈ exp[−N ξ(1 − u)L−kmin] .

(9a)

(9b)

We ﬁnd that pratchet decays exponentially with the
two quantities N ξ and (1 − u)L−kmin. The lat-
ter quantity grows exponentially with every turn of
i.e., (1 − u)L−kmin increases exponen-
the ratchet,
tially as the eﬀective genome length L − kmin de-
creases. Moreover, N ξ is proportional to n0, which
again increases exponentially with decreasing eﬀec-
tive genome length. As a result, pratchet decays su-
perexponentially as the ratchet turns. This implies
that the ratchet will turn at a relatively high rate
initially, but can suddenly reach a point where the
waiting time exceeds any biologically relevant time
scale. This is dramatically illustrated in Fig. 3. Note
the logarithmic time scale. Within the ﬁrst 1000 gen-
erations, 70% of the genes were lost, while during the
next 105 generations, only an additional 10% of the
genes were lost. Moreover, in the ﬁnal 50000 genera-
tions, we observed hardly any clicks of the ratchet at
all.

Figure 3 gives also a comparison between simula-
tion results and our theoretical model. The theo-
retical prediction was derived from (9) by assuming

that the average waiting time till the next ratcheting
event is given by the inverse of pratchet, so that the
time until a certain kmin is reached is simply given
by the sum of the inverse ratchet probabilities from
the ﬁrst ratchet event until the (kmin − 1)th ratchet
event. When comparing the results thus obtained
to the simulation results, we ﬁnd that although the
model predicts a too early slowdown of the ratchet,
the qualitative form of the predicted curve agrees
well with the one from the simulations. This demon-
strates that our main reasoning about the increase
in waiting times between successive ratchet events
is correct, even though the microscopic details are
somewhat incorrect. The origin of the deviations be-
tween model and simulations is clear. At the begin-
ning of the simulation, we initialize all sequences to
the wild type with zero mutations, while the model
always assumes a fully developed mutation-selection
equilibrium. The population in the simulation thus
retains at early times a larger fraction of individu-
als in the least loaded classes than what the model
assumes, and the model overestimates the transition
probabilities. For later times, the model underesti-
mates the transition probabilities, because it disre-
gards cases in which the loss of the least loaded class
happens in more than one step, for example, cases in
which the number of individuals in the least loaded
class ﬁrst ﬂuctuates to an unusually low value be-
fore the currently least loaded class disappears com-
pletely.

In Fig. 4, we show another comparison between our
model and the simulation results. There, we consider
the average number of mutations in the population,
hki, instead of the number of mutations in the least
loaded class, kmin, so that we can compare our re-
sults to the moment expansion as well. In the eﬀec-
tive genome size model, we calculated hki from kmin
with the formula hki = (L − kmin)a. Both the eﬀec-
tive genome size model and the moment expansion
agree on the mutation rate at which Muller’s ratchet
starts to slow down. However, the form of the tran-
sition to a mutation free population is signiﬁcantly
mis-represented by the moment expansion, while the
eﬀective genome size model predicts the qualitative
form of the transition well. In addition, the moment
expansion does not yield any insights into the tempo-
ral change of the ratchet rate. The eﬀective genome
size model is therefore the more useful one, despite

4

its mathematical simplicity.

Simulation results
For population sizes below about one hundred, the
eﬀective genome size model consistently predicts too
low ratchet rates. This is not surprising, as our model
suﬀers from the same limitations that inﬁnite genome
models do when n0 . 1 (Gessler 1995), namely in-
suﬃcient equilibration of the least loaded class. We
therefore have to resort to simulation results for very
small population sizes. Fig. 5 shows the simulation
data from Fig. 4 for N = 500, and in addition re-
sults for N = 50 and N = 10. All three cases show
a very similar behavior, but shifted to smaller and
smaller mutation rates. For suﬃciently small muta-
tion rates, Muller’s ratchet stops after the ﬁrst few
clicks. In a transition region that covers roughly one
order of magnitude in the mutation rate, Muller’s
ratchet stops at intermediate points, with a good
fraction of genes lost, but another large fraction of
genes retained. When the mutation rate is too high,
all genes are lost within a biologically relevant time
scale.

In our analytical model presented above, we have
assumed that in order to predict the probablity of the
next click of the ratchet, it is suﬃcient to know the
eﬀective length L − kmin, while the absolute values
If this
of L and kmin do not enter the calculation.
assumption is correct, then for any given mutation
rate u, the value of L − kmin at which the ratchet
stops should be independent of L.
In other words,
the per-locus mutation rate u determines how many
loci can at most be retained unmutated, and the ge-
nomic mutation rate uL is largely irrelevant. Fig. 6
demonstrates that this reasoning is consistent with
our simulation results. When we plot the diﬀerence
between the length L and the average number of mu-
tations hki as a function of u, the results for widely
diﬀering lengths lie right on top of each other in the
regime in which substantial mutation accumulation
occurs.

We have also performed a number of simulations
with a non-zero rate of back mutations v (data not
shown). The main result is similar to the case of an
inﬁnite population, as depicted in Fig. 1. Unless the
back mutation rate is of the same order of magnitude
as the forward mutation rate, back mutations do not
have a large eﬀect on the rate at which mutations

accumulate. The ratio u/s and the population size
N are the main determinants of whether genomes ac-
cumulate a fair amount of mutations, or stay largely
mutation free.

Discussion

Two main diﬀerences between Muller’s ratchet
in inﬁnite and in ﬁnite genomes emerge from our
study. First, the ratchet rate is constant for inﬁnite
genomes, whereas the rate decays with every turn of
the ratchet in a ﬁnite genome. The slowdown of the
ratchet rate is so dramatic that the ratchet can stop
completely, even in the absence of epistasis or com-
pensatory mutations. Second, in an inﬁnite genome,
the main parameter that governs the ratchet rate,
besides the population size, is the ratio θ between
the genomic deleterious mutation rate and the selec-
tion strength (Haigh 1978).
In a ﬁnite genome, on
the other hand, it is not the genomic but the per
locus deleterious mutation rate that we have to com-
pare to the selection strength. As a consequence,
Muller’s ratchet is not as important a limiting factor
in the evolution of large genomes as was previously
thought (Maynard Smith 1978). An additional con-
sequence is that we can expect organisms with longer
genomes and more sophisticated error correction to
be less prone to mutation accumulation than organ-
isms with shorter genomes, even if the mutation rates
per genome are comparable.

Backwards or compensatory mutations result in an
additional slowdown of the ratchet. However, un-
less they occur at a rate comparable to the forward
rate, they do not play a signiﬁcant role in determin-
ing whether the ratchet stops early, or continues until
a large proportion of the genome is deteriorated. It is
therefore adequate to neglect them for order of mag-
nitude estimates of the ratchet rate. Nevertheless, a
complete theoretical description of the ratchet rate,
including a ﬁnite genome size and variable forward
and back mutation rates, is certainly desirable but
completely lacking at this point.

The range of parameters that case Muller’s ratchet
to halt early is certainly biologically plausible. For
example, Andersson and Hughes (1996) estimate the
mutation rate in Salmonella typhimurium to 0.0014–
in a
0.0072 mutations per genome per generation,
genome of about 200 genes (Riley 1993). Andersson
and Hughes do not estimate the selection strength s.

5

However, selection is certainly not weak, considering
that out of the ﬁve lineages in which ﬁtness loss was
observed, two experienced a doubling of their gener-
ation time, while the other three had an increase in
generation time of about 10–15%. Given the low mu-
tation rate and the number of bottlenecks of only 60,
we can estimate that this loss in ﬁtness was probably
due to only a small number of mutations, maybe be-
tween one and three. Of course, a more accurate es-
timate of the selection strength in this system would
be desirable. In any case, the parameters of the sim-
ulations in Fig. 5 (s = 0.1 and L = 100) are prob-
ably of the right order of magnitude, and hence we
ﬁnd that while bottlenecks of size one will lead to
Muller’s ratchet, bottleneck sizes above 10 or 50 will
not lead to persistent genome deterioration. There-
fore, if the bottlenecks encountered during transmis-
sion from one host to another are typically between
10 to 100 individuals, bacterial populations may not
suﬀer signiﬁcantly from mutation accumulation over
time.

In the case of RNA viruses, where mutation rates
are much higher, it seems that the risk of mutation
accumulation should be higher as well. Since suﬃ-
ciently large virus populations can exist without loss
in ﬁtness, however, we can assume that u/s ≪ 1,
so that Muller’s ratchet becomes important only for
very small populations. Most experimental work fo-
cuses on bottleneck sizes of one (Chao 1990; Duarte
et al. 1992; Elena et al. 1996; de la Pe˜na et al. 2000),
in which case loss of ﬁtness is readily observed after
a couple of serial transfers. However, these works do
not address intermediate bottleneck sizes between 10
and 100, or the change in ﬁtness over time. Therefore,
they do not allow a full assessment of the importance
of Muller’s ratchet in virus evolution. An impor-
tant step towards more conclusive experimental re-
sults has been presented in recent work by Chao and
coworkers (Chao et al. 1997; Burch and Chao 1999;
Burch and Chao 2000). There, a wide range of popu-
lation sizes has been investigated, and in particular in
Burch and Chao (1999), ﬁtness measurements have
been performed after every bottleneck. Propagation
of lineages of a strain with impaired ﬁtness showed re-
covery back to the original ﬁtness level for bottleneck
sizes of N = 33 or larger (Fig. 3 of Burch and Chao
1999). For N = 10, the original ﬁtness could not
be regained within 100 generations. However, Burch

and Chao did not observe a further decline in ﬁtness
at N = 10 either, instead they observed a slight ﬁt-
ness increase. Burch and Chao’s results for large bot-
tlenecks demonstrate that compensatory mutations
are readily available for suﬃciently large population
sizes, so that a virus population can easily recover
a short sequence of extreme bottlenecks if later it is
allowed to expand again. Their results for N = 10
suggest two alternative interpretations. On the one
hand, compensatory and deleterious mutations may
cancel each other almost exactly, so that the net re-
sult is a small ﬁtness increase. On the other hand, the
impaired virus strain may already have reached the
point at which Muller’s ratchet stops to operate for
N = 10. In that case, the lineage is protected from
further mutation accumulation, and can safely exist
until some compensatory mutations occur eventually.
We believe that the second explanation is the more
accurate one, but the current data does not allow to
reject one of the two scenarios conclusively. More
data at small bottleneck sizes (between one and 10)
and for longer times should allow a more accurate
assessment of these issues.

For the second moment, we will in the following use
the symbol V instead of M2.

Appendix

The following calculation is directly analogous to
the one presented by Woodcock and Higgs (1996) We
refer to their work for a more complete description of
the necessary steps.

Assume that an individual i carries ki deleterious
mutations and creates an oﬀspring with j = ki +
mi deleterious mutations. The probability that an
oﬀpring carries exactly j mutations is given by the
transition matrix

hkit+1 =

1
N Xi
With (11) and (13), and the equilibrium condition
hkit+1 = hkit+1 = hki, we ﬁnd

ni(ki + mi) .

(17)

(u + v)hki + [1 − (u + v)]sV = uL .

(18)

Similarly, from

hk2it+1 =

ni(ki + mi)2

(19)

N Xi

Mjk =

min(k,l−j)

Xi=max(0,k−j)

k
i (cid:19)(cid:18)

l − k
j − k + i(cid:19)

(cid:18)

viuj−k+i

and

× (1 − v)k−i(1 − u)l−j−i .
The expectation values of mi and m2

i are

hki2

t+1 =

1
N 2

Xi Xj

(10)

ninj(ki + mi)(kj + mj)

(20)

we ﬁnd in equilibrium, using (11)–(15),

E(mi) =

(j − ki)Mjki = u(l − k) − vk ,

(11)

V = [1 − (u + v)]2[(1 − 1/N )V − sM3]

E(m2

i ) =

(j − ki)2Mjki = k2(u + v)2

Xj

Xj

+ k[−u2 − v2 + (v − u) + 2u2 − 2uL(u + v)]
+ u(1 − u)L + u2L2 .

(12)

Both results reduce to the ones found by Woodcock
and Higgs if we set v = u. Now consider two in-
dividuals i and j with ﬁtnesses wi = (1 − s)ki and
wj = (1 − s)kj that have ni and nj oﬀspring in the
next generation. The expected values of ni, n2
i , and
ninj have been calculated by Woodcock and Higgs,
and we only state the ﬁnal result for completeness:

E(ni) ≈ 1 − s(ki − hki) ,
E(n2

i ) ≈ 2 − 1/N − 3s(ki − hki) ,

(13)

(14)

E(ninj) ≈ 1 − 1/N − s(ki − hki) − s(kj − hki) .

+ [u(u − 1) − v(v − 1)] × [(1 − 1/N )hki − sV ]

+ u(1 − u)L(1 − 1/N ) .

(21)

These two equations contain three variables, and in
general every equation of higher order will contain
correspondingly higher moments, so that the set of
equations can never be solved. This problem can be
avoided with a suitable closure approximation. Fol-
lowing Woodcock and Higgs, we use

M3 = V (1 − 2hki/L),

(22)

which is the expression for the third moment in an
inﬁnite population. With (18), (21), and (22), hki is
uniquely determined, and we ﬁnd

In what follows, we have to distinguish between av-

erages over an ensemble of independent evolutionary
histories, denoted by . . . . The ensemble-averaged

nite population as a function of u/s for various back
mutation rates v.

Figure 2: Average number of mutations hki vs. the
back mutation rate v, for N = 100, and s = u = 0.01.
Solid lines represent the analytic prediction based on
(9), points represent simulation results, averaged over
5 replicates. The errors in the simulation are of the
order of the symbol size.

Figure 3: Number of mutations in the least loaded
class as a function of time, for N = 1000, L = 100,
s = 0.1, u = 0.01, and v = 0. The thin solid lines rep-
resent simulation results, the thick dashed line rep-
resents the theoretical prediction obtained from (9).

Figure 4: Average number of mutations in the pop-
ulation vs. genomic mutation rate, for N = 500,
L = 100, s = 0.1, and v = 0. The individual points
represent results from simulation results, averaged
over 5 replicates. The errors are of the order of the
symbol size. The solid line represents the theoreti-
cal prediction obtained from (9), and the dashed line
represents the moment expansion result (23). The
simulation results and equation (9) were evaluated
after t = 105 generations. The moment expansion
predicts an equilibrium point, so time does not enter
this equation.

ulation vs. genomic mutation rate, for various popu-
lation sizes N , and L = 100, s = 0.1, v = 0. The
individual points represent results from simulation
results, averaged over 5 replicates. The errors are
of the order of the symbol size.

Figure 6: Average number of mutation-free loci
L − hki vs. mutation rate u, for various length L and

replicates. The errors are of the order of the symbol
size.

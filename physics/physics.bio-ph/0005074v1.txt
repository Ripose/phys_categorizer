In order to make a case for or against a trend in the evolution
of complexity in biological evolution, complexity needs to be both
rigorously deﬁned and measurable. A recent information-theoretic
(but intuitively evident) deﬁnition identiﬁes genomic complexity
with the amount of information a sequence stores about its envi-
ronment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in
populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolu-
tionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that because
natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural “Maxwell
Demon”, within a ﬁxed environment genomic complexity is forced
to increase.

Darwinian evolution is a simple yet powerful process that requires only a
population of reproducing organisms in which each oﬀspring has the potential
for a heritable variation from its parent. This principle governs evolution in
the natural world, and has gracefully produced organisms of vast complexity.
Still, whether or not complexity increases through evolution has become a
contentious issue. Gould [1] for example argues that any recognizable trend
can be explained by the “drunkard’s walk” model, where “progress” is due
simply to a ﬁxed boundary condition. McShea [2] investigates trends in the
evolution of certain types of structural and functional complexity, and ﬁnds
some evidence of a trend but nothing conclusive. In fact, he concludes that
“Something may be increasing. But is it complexity?” Bennett [3], on the

other hand, resolves the issue by ﬁat, deﬁning complexity as “that which
increases when self-organizing systems organize themselves”. Of course, in
order to address this issue, complexity needs to be both deﬁned and measur-
able.

In this paper, we skirt the issue of structural and functional complexity
by examining genomic complexity.
It is tempting to believe that genomic
complexity is mirrored in functional complexity and vice versa. Such an hy-
pothesis however hinges upon both the aforementioned ambiguous deﬁnition
of complexity and the obvious diﬃculty of matching genes with function.
Several developments allow us to bring a new perspective to this old prob-
lem. On the one hand, genomic complexity can be deﬁned in a consistent
information-theoretic manner (the “physical” complexity [4]), which appears
to encompass intuitive notions of complexity used in the analysis of genomic
structure and organization [5]. On the other hand, it has been shown that
evolution can be observed in an artiﬁcial medium [6, 8], providing a unique
glimpse at universal aspects of the evolutionary process in a computational
world. In this system, the symbolic sequences subject to evolution are com-
puter programs that have the ability to self-replicate via the execution of their
own code. In this respect, they are computational analogs of catalytically
active RNA sequences that serve as the templates of their own reproduc-
tion. In populations of such sequences that adapt to their world (inside of
a computer’s memory), noisy self-replication coupled with ﬁnite resources
and an information-rich environment leads to a growth in sequence length
as the digital organisms incorporate more and more information about their
environment into their genome [7]. These populations allow us to observe
the growth of physical complexity explicitly, and also to distinguish distinct
evolutionary pressures acting on the genome and analyze them in a mathe-
matical framework.

If an organism’s complexity is a reﬂection of the physical complexity of
its genome (as we assume here) the latter is of prime importance in evolu-
tionary theory. Physical complexity, roughly speaking, reﬂects the number
of base pairs in a sequence that are functional. As is well known, equating
genomic complexity with genome length in base pairs gives rise to a conun-
drum (known as the C-value paradox) because large variations in genomic
complexity (in particular in eukaryotes) seem to bear little relation to the
diﬀerences in organismic complexity [9]. The C-value paradox is partly re-
solved by recognizing that not all of DNA is functional; that there is a neutral
fraction that can vary from species to species. If we were able to monitor

2

the non-neutral fraction, it is likely that a signiﬁcant increase in this frac-
tion could be observed throughout at least the early course of evolution. For
the later period, in particular the later Phanerozoic Era, it is unlikely that
the growth in complexity of genomes is due solely to innovations in which
genes with novel functions arise de novo. Indeed, most of the enzyme activ-
ity classes in mammals, for example, are already present in prokaryotes [10].
Rather, gene duplication events leading to repetitive DNA and subsequent
diversiﬁcation [11] as well as the evolution of gene regulation patterns ap-
pears to be a more likely scenario for this stage. Still, we believe that the
Maxwell Demon mechanism described below is at work during all phases of
evolution and provides the driving force toward ever increasing complexity
in the natural world.

Information Theory and Complexity

Using information theory to understand evolution and the information
content of the sequences it gives rise to is not a new undertaking. Unfor-
tunately, many of the earlier attempts (e.g., Refs. [12, 13, 14]) confuse the
picture more than clarifying it, often clouded by misguided notions of the
concept of information [15]. An (at times amusing) attempt to make sense
of these misunderstandings is Ref. [16].

Perhaps a key aspect of information theory is that information cannot
exist in a vacuum, that is, information is physical [17]. This statement implies
that information must have an instantiation (be it ink on paper, bits in a
computer’s memory, or even the neurons in a brain). Furthermore, it also
implies that information must be about something. Lines on a piece of paper,
for example, are not inherently information until it is discovered that they
correspond to something, such as (in the case of a map) to the relative
location of local streets and buildings. Consequently, any arrangement of
symbols might be viewed as potential information (also known as entropy
in information theory), but acquires the status of information only when its
correspondence, or correlation, to other physical objects is revealed.

In biological systems the instantiation of information is DNA, but what
is this information about? To some extent, it is the blueprint of an organ-
ism and thus information about its own structure. More speciﬁcally, it is
a blueprint of how to build an organism that can best survive in its na-
tive environment, and pass on that information to its progeny. This view
corresponds essentially to Dawkins’ view of selﬁsh genes that “use” their
environment (including the organism itself), for their own replication [18].

3

Thus, those parts of the genome that do correspond to something (the non-
neutral fraction, that is) correspond in fact to the environment the genome
lives in. Deutsch [19] referred to this view as “Genes embody knowledge
about their niches”. This environment is extremely complex itself, and con-
sists of the ribosomes the messages are translated in, other chemicals and the
abundance of nutrients inside and outside the cell, the environment of the
organism proper (e.g., the oxygen abundance in the air as well as ambient
temperatures), among many others. An organism’s DNA thus is not only
a “book” about the organism, but is also a book about the environment it
lives in including the species it co-evolves with. It is well-known that not
all the symbols in an organism’s DNA correspond to something. These sec-
tions, sometimes referred to as “junk-DNA”, usually consist of portions of
the code that are unexpressed or untranslated (i.e., excised from the mRNA).
More modern views concede that unexpressed and untranslated regions in the
genome can have a multitude of uses, such as for example satellite DNA near
the centromere, or the poly-C polymerase intron excised from Tetrahymena
rRNA. In the absence of a complete map of the function of each and every
base pair in the genome, how can we then decide which stretch of code is
“about something” (and thus contributes to the complexity of the code) or
else is entropy (i.e., random code without function)?

A true test for whether or not a sequence is information uses the success
(ﬁtness) of its bearer in its environment, which implies that a sequence’s
information content is conditional on the environment it is to be interpreted
within [4]. Accordingly, Mycoplasma mycoides for example (which causes
pneumonia-like respiratory illnesses), has a complexity of somewhat less than
one million base pairs in our nasal passages, but close to zero complexity
most everywhere else, because it cannot survive in any other environment—
meaning its genome does not correspond to anything there. A genetic locus
that codes for information essential to an organism’s survival will be ﬁxed in
an adapting population because all mutations of the locus result in the or-
ganism’s inability to promulgate the tainted genome, whereas inconsequential
(neutral) sites will be randomized by the constant mutational load. Examin-
ing an ensemble of sequences large enough to obtain statistically signiﬁcant
substitution probabilities would thus be suﬃcient to separate information
from entropy in genetic codes. The neutral sections that contribute only to
the entropy turn out to be exceedingly important for evolution to proceed,
as has been pointed out, for example, by Maynard Smith [20].

In Shannon’s information theory [22], the quantity entropy (H) repre-

4

sents the expected number of bits required to specify the state of a physical
object given a distribution of probabilities, that is, it measures how much
information can potentially be stored in it.

In a genome, for a site i that can take on four nucleotides with probabil-

ities

{pC(i), pG(i), pA(i), pT (i)} ,

the entropy of this site is

Hi = −

C,G,A,T

X

j

pj(i) log pj(i) .

(1)

(2)

The maximal entropy per-site (if we agree to take our logarithms to base
4, i.e., the size of the alphabet) is 1, which occurs if all the probabilities
are all equal to 1/4. If the entropy is measured in bits (take logarithms to
base 2) the maximal entropy per site is two bits, which naturally is also the
maximal amount of information that can be stored in a site, as entropy is
just potential information. A site stores maximal information if, in DNA, it
is perfectly conserved across an equilibrated ensemble. Then, we assign the
probability p = 1 to one of the bases and zero to all others, rendering Hi = 0
for that site according to Eq. (2). The amount of information per site is thus
(see, e.g., Ref. [23])

I(i) = Hmax − Hi .

(3)

In the following, we measure the complexity of an organism’s sequence
by applying Eq. (3) to each site and summing over the sites. Thus, for an
organism of ℓ base pairs the complexity is

C = ℓ − X

H(i) .

i

(4)

It should be clear that this value can only be an approximation to the true
physical complexity of an organism’s genome. In reality, sites are not inde-
pendent and the probability to ﬁnd a certain base at one position may be
conditional on the probability to ﬁnd another base at another position. Such
correlations between sites are called epistatic and they can render the entropy
per molecule signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the sum of the per-site entropies [4].

5

This entropy per molecule, which takes into account all epistatic correlations
between sites, is deﬁned as

H = − X

p(g|E) log p(g|E)

g

(5)

and involves an average over the logarithm of the conditional probabilities
p(g|E) to ﬁnd genotype g given the current environment E. In every ﬁnite
population, estimating p(g|E) using the actual frequencies of the genotypes
in the population (if those could be obtained) results in corrections to Eq. (5)
larger than the quantity itself [24], rendering the estimate useless. Another
avenue for estimating the entropy per molecule is the creation of mutational
clones at several positions at the same time [25, 8] to measure epistatic eﬀects.
The latter approach is feasible within experiments with simple ecosystems of
digital organisms that we introduce in the following section, which reveal sig-
niﬁcant epistatic eﬀects. The technical details of the complexity calculation
including these eﬀects are relegated to the Appendix.

Digital Evolution

Experiments in evolution have traditionally been formidable due to evolu-
tion’s gradual pace in the natural world. One successful method uses micro-
scopic organisms with generational times on the order of hours, but even this
approach has diﬃculties; it is still impossible to perform measurements with
high precision, and the time-scale to see signiﬁcant adaptation remains weeks,
at best. Populations of E.coli introduced into new environments begin adap-
tation immediately, with signiﬁcant results apparent in a few weeks [26, 27].
Observable evolution in most organisms occurs on time scales of at least
years.

To complement such an approach, we have developed a tool to study
evolution in a computational medium—the Avida platform [6]. The Avida
system hosts populations of self-replicating computer programs in a complex
and noisy environment, within a computer’s memory. The evolution of these
“digital organisms” is limited in speed only by the computers used, with
generations (for populations of the order 103 − 104 programs) in a typical
trial taking only a few seconds. Despite the apparent simplicity of the single-
niche environment and the limited interactions between digital organisms,
very rich dynamics can be observed in experiments with 3,600 organisms on
a 60 × 60 grid with toroidal boundary conditions (see Methods). As this
population is quite small, we can assume that an equilibrium population

6

will be dominated by organisms of a single species [28], whose members
all have similar functionality and equivalent ﬁtness (except for organisms
that lost the capability to self-replicate due to mutation). In this world, a
new species can obtain a signiﬁcant abundance only if it has a competitive
advantage (increased Malthusian parameter) thanks to a beneﬁcial mutation.
While the system returns to equilibrium after the innovation, this new species
will gradually exert dominance over the population, bringing the previously-
dominant species to extinction. This dynamics of innovation and extinction
can be monitored in detail and appears to mirror the dynamics of E. coli in
single-niche long-term evolution experiments [29].

The complexity of an adapted digital organism according to Eq. (4) can be
obtained by measuring substitution frequencies at each instruction across the
population. Such a measurement is easiest if genome size is constrained to be
constant as is done in the experiments reported below, though this constraint
can be relaxed by implementing a suitable alignment procedure. In order to
correctly assess the information content of the ensemble of sequences, we
need to obtain the substitution probabilities pi at each position, which go
into the calculation of the per-site entropy Eq. (2). Care must be taken to
wait suﬃciently long after an innovation, in order to give those sites within
a new species that are variable a chance to diverge. Indeed, shortly after an
innovation, previously 100% variable sites will appear ﬁxed by “hitchhiking”
on the successful genotype, a phenomenon discussed further below.

We simplify the problem of obtaining substitution probabilities for each
instruction by assuming that all mutations are either lethal, neutral, or pos-
itive, and furthermore assume that all non-lethal substitutions persist with
equal probability. We then categorize every possible mutation directly by
creating all single-mutation genomes and examining them independently in
isolation. In that case Eq. (2) reduces to

Hi = log28(Nν) ,

(6)

where Nν is the number of non-lethal substitutions (we count mutations that
signiﬁcantly reduce the ﬁtness among the lethals). Note that the logarithm
is taken with respect to the size of the alphabet.

This per-site entropy is used to illustrate the variability of loci in a

genome, just before and after an evolutionary transition, in Fig. 1.

Progression of Complexity Tracking the entropy of each site in the ge-
nome allows us to document the growth of complexity in an evolutionary

coded according to the entropy of that site (see color bar). Red sites are

extracted just before and after a major evolutionary transition.

event. For example, it is possible to measure the diﬀerence in complexity
between the pair of genomes in Fig. 1, separated by only 203 generations
and a powerful evolutionary transition. Comparing their entropy maps, we
can immediately identify the sections of the genome that code for the new
“gene” that emerged in the transition—the entropy at those sites has been
drastically reduced, while the complexity increase across the transition (tak-
ing into account epistatic eﬀects) turns out to be ∆C ≈ 6, as calculated in
the Appendix.

We can extend this analysis by continually surveying the entropies of
each site during the course of an experiment. Figure 2 does this for the
experiment just discussed, but this time the substitution probabilities are
obtained by sampling the actual population at each site. A number of fea-
tures are apparent in this ﬁgure. First, the trend toward a “cooling” of the
genome (i.e., to more conserved sites) is obvious. Second, evolutionary tran-
sitions can be identiﬁed by vertical darkened “bands”, which arise because
the genome instigating the transition replicates faster than its competitors

thus driving them into extinction. As a consequence, even random sites that
are “hitchhiking” on the successful gene are momentarily ﬁxed.

Hitchhiking is documented clearly by plotting the sum of per-site en-
tropies for the population (as an approximation for the entropy of the ge-
nome)

across the transition in Figure 3A. By comparing this to the ﬁtness shown
in Figure 3B, we can identify a sharp drop in entropy followed by a slower
recovery for each adaptive event that the population undergoes. Often, the
population does not reach equilibrium (the state of maximum entropy given
the current conditions) before the next transition occurs.

While this entropy is not a perfect approximation of the exact entropy
per program Eq. (5), it reﬂects the disorder in the population as a function
of time. This complexity estimate (4) is shown as a function of evolutionary
time for this experiment in Figure 4. It increases monotonically except for
the periods just after transitions, when the complexity estimate (after over-
shooting the equilibrium value) settles down according to thermodynamics’
second law (see below). This overshooting of stable complexity is a result of

the overestimate of complexity during the transition due to the hitchhiking
eﬀect mentioned earlier.
Its eﬀect is also seen at the beginning of evolu-
tion, where the population is seeded with a single genome with no variation
present.

Such a typical evolutionary history documents that the physical com-
plexity, measuring the amount of information coded in the sequence about
its environment, indeed steadily increases. The circumstances under which
this is assured to happen are discussed presently.

Figure 4: Complexity as a function of time, calculated according to Eq. (4).
Vertical dashed lines as in Fig. 3.

Let us consider an evolutionary transition like the one connecting the
genomes in Figure 1 in more detail.
In this transition, the entropy (cf.
Fig. 3A) does not fully recover after its initial drop. The diﬀerence between
the equilibrium level before the transition and after is proportional to the
information acquired in the transition, roughly the number of sites that were
frozen. This diﬀerence would be equal to the acquired information if the
measured entropy Eq. (7) were equal to the exact one given by Eq. (5). For
this particular situation, in which the sequence length is ﬁxed along with the
environment, is it possible that the complexity decreases? The answer is that
in a suﬃciently large population this cannot happen (in smaller populations,
there is a ﬁnite probability of all organisms being mutated simultaneously,
referred to as Muller’s ratchet [30]), as a consequence of a simple application
of the second law of thermodynamics. If we assume that a population is at
equilibrium in a ﬁxed environment, each locus has achieved its highest en-
tropy given all the other sites. Then, with genome length ﬁxed, the entropy
can only stay constant or decrease, implying that the complexity (being se-
quence length minus entropy) can only increase. How is a drop in entropy
commensurate with the second law? This answer is simple also: the second
law holds only for equilibrium systems, while such a transition is decidedly
not of the equilibrium type. In fact, each such transition is best described
as a measurement, and evolution as a series of random measurements on
the environment. Darwinian selection is a ﬁlter, allowing only informative
measurements (those increasing the ability for an organism to survive) to be

11

preserved. In other words, information cannot be lost in such an event be-
cause a mutation corrupting the information is purged due to the corrupted
genome’s inferior ﬁtness (this holds strictly for asexual populations only).
Conversely, a mutation that corrupts the information cannot increase the
ﬁtness, because if it did then the population was not at equilibrium in the
ﬁrst place. As a consequence, only mutations that reduce the entropy are
kept while mutations that increase it are purged. Because the mutations
can be viewed as measurements, this is the classical behavior of the Maxwell
Demon.

What about changes in sequence length? In an unchanging environment,
an increase or decrease in sequence length is always associated with an in-
crease or decrease in the entropy, and such changes therefore always cancel
from the physical complexity, as it is deﬁned as the diﬀerence. Note, how-
ever, that while size-increasing events do not increase the organism’s physical
complexity, they are critical to continued evolution as they provide new space
(“blank tape”) to record environmental information within the genome, and
thus to allow complexity to march ever forward.

Methods

For all work presented here, we use a single-niche environment in which
resources are isotropically distributed and unlimited except for CPU time, the
primary resource for this life-form. This limitation is imposed by constraining
the average slice of CPU time executed by any genome per update to be a
constant (here 30 instructions). Thus, per update a population of N genomes
executes 30 × N instructions. The unlimited resources are numbers that the
programs can retrieve from the environment with the right genetic code.
Computations on these numbers allow the organisms to execute signiﬁcantly
larger slices of CPU time, at the expense of inferior ones (see [6, 8]).

A normal Avida organism is a single genome (program) composed of a
sequence of instructions that are processed as commands to the CPU of a
virtual computer. In standard Avida experiments, an organism’s genome
has one of 28 possible instructions at each line. The set of instructions (al-
phabet) from which an organism draws its code is selected to avoid biasing
evolution towards any particular type of program or environment. Still, evo-
lutionary experiments will always show a distinct dependence on the ancestor
used to initiate experiments, and on the elements of chance and history. To
minimize these eﬀects, trials are repeated in order to gain statistical signif-
icance, another crucial advantage of experiments in artiﬁcial evolution. In

12

the present experiments, we have chosen to keep sequence length ﬁxed at
100 instructions, by creating a self-replicating ancestor containing mostly
non-sense code, from which all populations are spawned. Mutations appear
during the copy process, which is ﬂawed with a probability of error per in-
struction copied of 0.01. For more details on Avida, see [31].

Conclusions

Trends in the evolution of complexity are diﬃcult to argue for or against
if there is no agreement on how to measure complexity. We have proposed
here to identify the complexity of genomes by the amount of information
they encode about the world in which they have evolved, a quantity known
as physical complexity that, while it can be measured only approximately,
allows quantitative statements to be made about the evolution of genomic
complexity. In particular, we show that in ﬁxed environments, for organisms
whose ﬁtness depends only on their own sequence information, physical com-
plexity must always increase. That a genome’s physical complexity must be
reﬂected in the structural complexity of the organism that harbors it seems
to us inevitable, as the purpose of a physically complex genome is complex
information processing, which can only be achieved by the computer which
it (the genome) creates.

That the mechanism of the Maxwell Demon lies at the heart of the com-
plexity of living forms today is rendered even more plausible by the many
circumstances which may cause it to fail. First, simple environments spawn
only simple genomes. Second, changing environments can cause a drop in
physical complexity, with a commensurate loss in (computational) function
of the organism, as now meaningless genes are shed. Third, sexual reproduc-
tion can lead to an accumulation of deleterious mutations (strictly forbidden
in asexual populations) that can also render the Demon powerless. All such
exceptions are observed in nature.

Notwithstanding these vagaries, we are able to observe the Demon’s op-
eration directly in the digital world, giving rise to complex genomes that,
though poor compared to their biochemical brethren, still stupefy us with
their intricacy and an uncanny amalgam of elegant solutions and clumsy
remnants of historical contingency. It is in no small measure an awe before
these complex programs, direct descendants of the simplest self-replicators
we ourselves wrote, that leads us to assert that even in this view of life,

Appendix: Epistasis and Complexity

Estimating the complexity according to Eq. (4) is somewhat limited in
scope, even though it may be the only practical means for actual biological
genomes for which substitution frequencies are known (such as, for example,
ensembles of tRNA sequences [4]). For digital organisms, this estimate can
be sharpened by testing all possible single and double mutants of the wild-
type for ﬁtness, and sampling the n-mutants to obtain the fraction of neutral
mutants at mutational distance n, w(n).
In this manner, an ensemble of
mutants is created for a single wild-type resulting in a much more accurate
estimate of its information content. As this procedure involves an evaluation
of ﬁtness, it is easiest for organisms whose survival rate is closely related to
their organic ﬁtness, i.e., for organisms who are not “epistatically linked” to
other organisms in the population. Note that this is precisely the limit in
which Fisher’s Theorem guarantees an increase in complexity [32].

For an organism of length ℓ with instructions taken from an alphabet of
size D, let w(1) be the number of neutral one-point mutants Nν(1) divided
by the total number of possible one-point mutations

w(1) =

Nν(1)

Dℓ

.

(8)

Note that Nν(1) includes the wild-type ℓ times, for each site is replaced (in
the generation of mutants) by each of the D instructions. Consequently, the
worst w(1) is equal to D−1.
In the literature, w(n) usually refers to the
average ﬁtness (normalized to the wild-type) of n-mutants. While this can
be obtained here in principle, for the purposes of our information-theoretic
estimate we assume that all non-neutral mutants are non-viable [33]. We
have found that for digital organisms the average n-mutant ﬁtness closely
mirrors the function w(n) investigated here.

Other values of w(n) are obtained accordingly. We deﬁne

w(2) =

Nν(2)

D2 ℓ(ℓ − 1)/2

,

(9)

14

where Nν(2) is the number of neutral double mutants, including the wild-type
and all neutral single mutations included in Nν(1), and so forth.

For the genome before the transition (pictured on the left in Fig. 1) we
can collect Nν(n) as well as N+(n) (the number of mutants that result in
increased ﬁtness) to construct w(n). In Tab. 1, we list the fraction of neutral
and positive n−mutants of the wild-type, as well as the number of neutral
or positive found and the total number of mutants tried.

Note that we have sampled the mutant distribution up to n = 8 (where
we tried 109 genotypes), in order to gain statistical signiﬁcance. The function
is well ﬁt by a two-parameter ansatz

w(n) = D−αnβ

(10)

introduced earlier [8], where 1 − α measures the degree of neutrality in the
code (0 < α < 1), and β reﬂects the degree of epistasis (β > 1 for synergistic
deleterious mutations, β < 1 for antagonistic ones). Using this function, the
complexity of the wild-type can be estimated as follows.

From the information-theoretic considerations in the main text, the in-

formation about the environment stored in a sequence is

C = Hmax − H = ℓ − H ,

(11)

where H is the entropy of the wild-type given its environment. We have pre-
viously approximated it by summing the per-site entropies of the sequence,
thus ignoring correlations between the sites. Using w(n), a multi-site entropy
can be deﬁned as

Hℓ = logD (cid:2)w(ℓ)Dℓ(cid:3) ,

(12)

reﬂecting the average entropy of a sequence of length ℓ. As Dℓ is the total
number of diﬀerent sequences of length ℓ, w(ℓ)Dℓ is the number of neutral
sequences, in other words all those sequences that carry the same information
as the wild-type. The “coarse-grained” entropy is just the logarithm of that
number. Eq. (12) thus represents the entropy of a population based on
one wild-type in perfect equilibrium in an inﬁnite population.
It should
approximate the exact result Eq. (5) if all neutral mutants have the same
ﬁtness and therefore the same abundance in an inﬁnite population.

Naturally, Hℓ is impossible to obtain for reasonably sized genomes as the
number of mutations to test in order to obtain w(ℓ) is of the order Dℓ. This

15

is precisely the reason why we chose to approximate the entropy in Eq. (4) in
the ﬁrst place. However, it turns out that in most cases the constants α and
β describing w(n) can be estimated from the ﬁrst few n. The complexity of
the wild-type, using the ℓ-mutant entropy (12) can be deﬁned as

Using (10), we ﬁnd

Cℓ = ℓ − Hℓ .

Cℓ = α ℓβ ,

(13)

(14)

and naturally, for the complexity based on single mutations only (completely
ignoring epistatic interactions)

C1 = αℓ .

Thus, obtaining α and β from a ﬁt to w(n) allows an estimate of the
complexity of digital genomes including epistatic interactions. As an exam-
ple, let us investigate the complexity increase across the transition treated
earlier. Using both neutral and positive mutants to determine w(n), a ﬁt to
the data in Table 1 using the functional form Eq. (10) yields β = 0.988(8)
(α is obtained exactly via w(1)). This in turn leads to a complexity estimate

16

Cℓ = 49.4. After the transition, we analyze the new wild-type again and ﬁnd
β = 0.986(8), not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from before the transition (while we
found β = 0.996(9) during the transition).

The complexity estimate according to this ﬁt is Cℓ = 55.0, leading to a
complexity increase during the transition of ∆Cℓ = 5.7, or about 6 instruc-
tions. Conversely, if epistatic interactions are not taken into account, the
same analysis would suggest ∆C1 = 6.4, somewhat larger. The same analy-
sis can be carried out taking into account neutral mutations only to calculate
w(n), leading to ∆Cℓ = 3.0 and ∆C1 = 5.4.

A classiﬁcation in universality classes of broad categories of phenomenologies, belonging to dif-
ferent disciplines, may be very useful for a crossfertilization among them and for the purpose of
pattern recognition. We present here a simple scheme for the classiﬁcation of nonlinear growth
problems. The success of the scheme in predicting and characterizing the well known Gompertz,
West and logistic models, suggests to us the study of a hitherto unexplored class of nonlinear growth
problems.

Present eﬀorts towards the understanding of complex
systems in physics, biology, economics and social science
require complementary microscopic and macroscopic de-
scriptions. In fact, due to the complexity of the underly-
ing dynamics and the unbounded variety of external con-
ditions, a fundamental approach is missing. Microscopic
models depend on such a large number of parameters
that they often lose almost any predictive power, even
when the calculations do not become forbiddenly diﬃ-
cult or time consuming. On the other hand, macroscopic
descriptions are often inadequate and do not take advan-
tage of the enormous progress that has been achieved at
the microscopic level in recent years. An intermediate
(mesoscopic) approach [1, 2, 3] may be very fruitful, but
a bridging among the various levels [4] is not always easy
to accomplish.

A diﬀerent approach has consequently emerged for the
treatment of problems , which do not directly require
a detailed description of the system to be investigated.
The idea is to exploit the spectacular advancement of
interdisciplinary research, which has taken place in the
last two decades or so, involving e.g.
the relevance of
scale laws, complexity and nonlinearity in virtually all
disciplines.

In this context many patterns have been discovered,
which are remarkably similar, although they concern
completely diﬀerent phenomenologies. This is hardly sur-
prising, since often the ”background” mathematics is the
same. We shall call them “phenomenological universal-
ities” [5], in the sense that they refer to a ”transversal”
generality (not to a uniformly general behaviour within
a given class of phenomena).

As examples of universality we can quote the “life’s
universal scaling laws” [6], which will be discussed later,
and the “universality of nonclassical nonlinearity” [7].
The latter suggests that unexpected eﬀects, such as those
recently discovered by P. Johnson and collaborators [8]
and called by them “Fast Dynamics”, may be found as
well, although possibly with quite diﬀerent manifesta-
tions in other ﬁelds of research.

A reliable macroscopic analysis of a complex system
requires two fundamental ingredients: non linearity and
stochasticity. Non linearity is more fundamental because
the stochastic behaviour requires a non linear dynamics.
Therefore non linearity must be considered as the fun-
damental feature of these systems and in this letter we
consider general growth problems based on this crucial
aspect. We shall show that diﬀerent “degrees of nonlin-
earity” (as speciﬁed below) correspond to various growth
patterns, which can be systematically classiﬁed.

For this purpose, let us consider the very broad class
of growth phenomena, which may be described by the
simple law:

dY (t)
dt

= α(t)Y (t)

(1)

where α(t) represents the speciﬁc growth rate, which
may vary with time, of a given variable Y (t). By intro-
ducing the nondimensional variables τ = α(0)t, y(t) =
Y (t)/Y (0) and a(τ ) = α(t)/α(0), Eq.(1) becomes:

with y(0) = a(0) = 1. By deﬁning the time variation of
a(τ ) through a function Φ(a):

dy(τ )
dτ

= a(τ )y(τ )

Φ(a) =

da(τ )
dτ

−

(2)

(3)

we obtain a system of two diﬀerential equations, which
may generate a variety of growth patterns, according to
the explicit form of Φ(a) , and is usually analyzed by the
standard ﬁxed points and characteristic curves methods
[9].

In this contribution we are not directly interested in
this aspect, but we wish to show, instead, how the non-
linear terms in Φ(a) aﬀect the growth dynamics process.

We assume that

in which we retain only a limited number of N + 1
terms. Borrowing from the language of phase transitions
[10] , we deﬁne, as belonging to the phenomenological
universality class of order N (which we shall call UN,
N=1,2,...), the ensemble of all the phenomenology, which
may be suitably described by truncating the series at the
power n=N. In the following we shall analyse in detail
the classes U1, U2 and U3 and provide a description of
their nonlinear properties.

= 0 with all bn = 0 for n

The “linear” behaviour of the system corresponds to a
constant speciﬁc growth rate, i.e. Φ(a) = 0 ( or bn = 0 for
any n). Then y(τ ) follows a purely exponential law. Also
1, can be easily
the case b0 6
shown to lead to an exponential growth. Since we are
interested only in the nonlinear eﬀects, we shall assume
b0 = 0. This does not cause any loss of generality, since
one can always expand Φ in the variable β = a
c, where
c is a solution of Σ∞
n=0bncn = 0. In the β expansion the
coeﬃcient of β0 vanishes. Likewise, again without any
loss of generality , we can set b1 = 1, as one would have
from an expansion in the variable γ = a/b1.

In order to study the various classes of universality
and obtain the corresponding diﬀerential equations and
solutions, we write from Eqs. (2) and (3):

from which it follows:

lny =

By solving the previous equation with respect to the vari-
able a(τ ) and then substituting into Eq. (2), one obtain
the diﬀerential equation characterizing the class. The in-
tegration constant can be easily obtained from the initial
conditions.

Let us then start by considering the class U1, i.e. with
(6) and Φ(a) = a , it immediately

N=1. From Eq.
follows:

y = exp[1

Eq.(7) represents the “canonical” form of U1 diﬀerential
equations and corresponds to the Gompertz law, orig-
inally introduced [11] in actuarial mathematics to eva-
lute the mortality tables and, nowdays, largely applied
to describe economical and biological growth phenomena.
For example, the Gompertz law gives a very good phe-
nomenological description of the tumor growth pattern
[12], [13] and it can be related to the energetic cellular
balance [14]. It is remarkable that it does not contain any
free parameter ( except for the scale and linear parame-
ters which have not been included, as discussed before),

(10)

i.e. all Gompertz curves are (under the mentioned pro-
viso) identical.

Let us now turn our attention to the class U2, i.e. N=2.
From Eqs. (6) and (3) and Φ(a) = a + ba2, where b = b2
, it follows

dy
dτ

= α2yp

where α2 = (1 + b)/b, p = 1

b and β2 = 1/b with the

By identifying y with the mass of a biological system,y =
m, and deﬁning the asymptotic mass (m0 = y0 = 1)

M = limτ →∞m(τ ) = (1 + b)1/p

(11)

it is easy to show that Eqs.
(9) and (10) correspond
to the well known allometric West equation for the case
p = 3/4 [15]. In their ontogenetic growth model, m rep-
resents the mass of any living organism, from protozoa
to mammalians (including plants as well). By redeﬁn-
(y/m)b and
ing their mass and time variables z = 1
blnM they obtain the very elegant pa-

which ﬁts well the data for a variety of diﬀerent species,
ranging from shrimps to hens to cows. It is interesting to
note that, in a subsequent work [16], West and collabo-
rators give an interpretation of θ as the “biological time”
, based on the organism’s internal temperature.

An extension of West’s law to neoplastic growths has
been recently suggested by C. Guiot, P.P. Delsanto, T.S.
Deisboeck and collaborators [17, 18]. Although an un-
ambigous ﬁtting of experimental data is much harder in
tumors (except for cultures in vitro of multicellular tumor
spheroids), the extension seems to work well . Of course,
particularly in vivo, other mechanisms must be taken into
account, such as the pressure from the surrounding tissue
[19]. Another important issue is the actual value of the
exponent p, which has been the object of a strong debate
[20]. Recently C. Guiot et al. [21] have proposed that p
may vary dinamically with the fractal nature of the input
channels (e.g. at the onset of angiogenesis).

Although it is not obvious from a comparison between
Eq. (7) and Eq. (9), U1 represents a special case (b = 0)
of U2, as it obviously follow from the power expansion of
Φ (which has b = 0 in U1). This can be veriﬁed directly
by carefully performing the limit b
0 in Eq. (10) . In
fact it is interesting to plot y vs. τ in a sort of phase
diagram ( see Fig. 1) .

This leads to a very suggestive interpretation of Eq.
(9). Having added a term to the Φ(a) expansion, we
gain, in U2, the possibility of adding a “new” ingredi-
ent, which turns out to be a diﬀerent dimensionality of

3

To conclude, we have developed a simple scheme,
which allows the classiﬁcation in nonlinear phenomeno-
logical universality classes of all the growth problems,
which can be described by Eqs. (2) and (3). We have
found that the ﬁrst class U1 corresponds to the Gompertz
curve, which has no free parameters (apart from scale
and linear ones). The second class U2 includes all the
Westlike and logistic curves and has a free parameter b:
when b=0 we fall back into U1 (Gompertz). The success
of the scheme in obtaining the classes U1 and U2 when
one or two terms are retained in the expansion of Φ(a)
has suggested to us to investigate the class U3, which is
generated by simply adding one more term (see Eq. 13).
To our knowledge, this class has never been investigated
before. A remarkable result is that each new class adds a
new “ingredient” (or growth mechanism). E.g. U2 allows
for the possible presence of two dimensionalities in the
energy ﬂux. U3 extends such a possibility to the growth
term ( the time derivative). In addition to its intrinsic
elegance [24] the concept of universality classes may be
useful for several reasons of applicative relevance. In fact
it greatly facilitates the crossfertilization among diﬀerent
ﬁelds of research by implicitly suggesting that a method
of analysis, which is proven advantageous in one study, be
tried and eventually adopted in others. Also, if an unex-
pected eﬀect is found experimentally in a ﬁeld, similar ef-
fects “mutatis mutandis” should also be sought in similar,
although unrelated, experiments in other ﬁelds. Finally,
if a detailed study is performed to recognize the patterns
that are characteristics of the most relevant classes (and
subclasses) , this could greatly help in classifying and ﬁt-
ting new sets of experimental data independently of the
ﬁeld of application.

the “energy ﬂux” i.e.
(metabolism). E.g.
the ﬁrst term on the RHS of Eq.
(9) may be related [22] to the premise that the tendency
of natural selection to optimise energy transport has led
to the evolution of fractal-like distribution networks with
an exponent p for their terminal units vs. an exponent 1
for ﬂux mechanisms related to the total number of cells.
When b=0, p=1 and we lose the new ingredient, thus
falling back into U1.

This is conﬁrmed also by considering the logistic equa-
tions, corresponding to eq.(9) with negative b. The usual
logistic equation is obtained for p = 2. As well known in
population dynamics [23], in this case the new ingredient
is the competition for resources.

Finally we consider the class U3. Writing

Φ(a) = a(1 + ba + ca2)

from Eq. (6) it follows

It is interesting to observe that, in the same way that
U2 adds ( with respect to U1) a term with a diﬀerent
dimensionality to the energy ﬂux contribution, U3 adds
such a term (the last one in Eq. 15) to the growth part.

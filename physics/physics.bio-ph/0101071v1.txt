Elastic wave propagation along DNA.

Thomas C. Bishop∗, Oleksandr O. Zhmudsky†

February 21, 2014

Abstract

It is shown that information transmission inside a cell can occur by
means of mechanical waves transmitted through DNA. The propaga-
tion of the waves is strongly dependent on the shape of the DNA thus
proteins that change the shape of DNA can alter signal transmission.
The overall eﬀect is a method of signal processing by DNA binding
proteins that creates a ”cellular communications network”.

The propagation of small amplitude disturbances through DNA
is treated according to the mechanical theory of elastic rods. Ac-
cording to the theory four types of mechanical waves aﬀecting exten-
sion(compression), twist, bend or shear can propagate through DNA.
Each type of wave has unique characteristic properties. Disturbances
aﬀecting all wave types can propagate independently of each other.
Using a linear approximation to the theory of motion of elastic rods,
the dispersion of these waves is investigated. The phase velocities of
the waves lies in the range 5 ∼ 8˚A/ps using constants suitable for a
description of DNA. The dispersion of all wave types of arbitrary wave
length is investigated for a straight, twisted rod.

Based on these ﬁndings, we propose all-atom numerical simulations
of DNA to investigate the propagation of these waves as an alternative
measure of the wave velocity and dispersion analysis.

Introduction

Our treatment of DNA is based on the hypothesis that such a well or-
ganized system as a cell must have a highly sophisticated system of com-
munications. For instance, the cell cycle is the result of a series of complex
self organized processes that must be well orchestrated. A model has been
developed to demonstrate how these events may be initiated by critical con-
centrations of speciﬁc proteins which shift equilibrium to favor the advance
of the cell cycle[1]. However, it is also known that the cell-cycle can be dis-
rupted if conditions are not suitable. Similar arguments apply to virtually all
cellular processes and in order to achieve the required checks and balances a
method of communication is necessary.

Is there the possibility that information is transmitted through DNA elec-
tromagnetically instead of mechanically? In such case DNA will function as
a transmission line which requires total internal reﬂection (TIR) of the ra-
diation within the DNA. To achieve TIR, the wavelength of the radiation
must be 5-10 times less than the diameter of the transmission line. Since the
diameter of the DNA is close to the 20 ˚A the radiation will have a wavelength
close to 2 ˚A. This wavelength is close to atomic dimensions so diﬀraction
should dominate. Furthermore, the energy associated with this wavelength
radiation is on the order of 105 kcal/mol which is suﬃcient to destroy chem-
ical bonds and therefore not easily managed biologically. For these reasons,
we believe that the communication will be achieved mechanically.

The remainder of the paper will demonstrate that the mechanical prop-
erties of DNA have the necessary time and spatial dimension to support the
propagation of information while interactions between proteins and DNA
provide a mechanism by which this information is processed.

In this system of equations, equation 1 represents the balance of force
and linear momentum and equation 2 represents the balance of torque and
angular momentum according to Newton’s Laws. Here, s and t are indepen-
dent variables representing time and ﬁducial arclength, respectively 1. The
functions that we wish to analyze are the four three-vector functions ~Ω, ~Γ,
~ω, and ~γ.

The matrices ˆI, ˆC and ˆD and the scalar ρ are as follows: Matrix ˆI is the
linear density of the moment of inertia tensor. Matrices ˆC and ˆD represent
the elastic properties of the rod (C3: Young’s modulus, C1 = C2: shear
modulus, D3: torsional rigidity, D1 = D2 bend stiﬀness). ρ is the linear
mass density and is equal to 3.22 × 10−15K/M for an isotropic model of
DNA. The matrices values have the following values for an isotropic model
of DNA:

the rod, the rod will generally experience extension in some places and compression in
others so the actual arc length will generally be diﬀerent from ﬁducial arc length. Actual
arc length plays no role in the equations of motion

For isotropic bending C1 = C2 and shear D1 = D2 we will denote C = C1 =
C2 and D = D1 = D2. These deﬁnitions will be used below. The values of
these coeﬃcients can be ﬁnd in [4], [5].

In biological terminology the components of ~Γ correspond to the three
DNA helical parameters describing translation ~Γ = (shift,slide,rise) and the
components of ~Ω correspond to the three DNA helical parameters describing
rotation ~Ω = (tilt,roll,twist). If we attach a local coordinate frame, denoted
by { ~d1, ~d2, ~d3}, to each base-pair the axes will point in the direction of the
major groove, minor groove and along the DNA helical axis, respectively. The
shape of the DNA can be described by a three-dimensional vector function
~r(s, t) which is related to ~Γ and ~Ω by a suitable mathematical integration.

In elastic rod terminology the three-dimensional vector function ~r(s, t)
gives the centerline curve of the rod as a function of s and t, showing only
how the rod bends. To show the twist, shear and extension of the rod we
must attach ”director” frames made of the orthogonal triples { ~d1, ~d2, ~d3} at
regular intervals along the rod. The director frames are evenly spaced along
the rod when the rod is not extended and are all parallel to each other
(with ~d3 pointing along the rod) when the rod is not bent or twisted. Any
deformation of the rod will be indicated by a corresponding change in the
orientation of the director frames.

The vector ~γ (~Γ) is the time (space) velocity of ~r:

~γ =

∂~r
∂t

~Γ =

∂~r
∂s

The directors are of constant unit length, so the velocity of each director ~ω
(~Ω) is always perpendicular to itself, and it must also be perpendicular to
the axis of rotation of the whole frame.

∂ ~dk
∂t

= ~ω × ~dk

= ~Ω × ~dk

∂ ~dk
∂s

We will denote the ~Γ of the unstrained state by ~Γ0. In general an un-
strained rod can have any shape. The most simple case is when the rod is
straight with unit extension, ~Γ0 = {0, 0, 1}, because in the unstrained state:

∂~r3
∂s

= {0, 0, 1}

4

Similarly, an unstressed elastic rod may have an intrinsic bend and/or
twist, denoted by ~Ω0. This must be subtracted from the total ~Ω to give the
dynamically active part. The simplest case is a rod with no intrinsic bend
or twist ~Ω = {0, 0, 0} and ~Γ0 = {0, 0, 1}.

For short wave lengths (Section 2) we will suppose that ~Ω0 =
(Ω01, Ω02, Ω03) = const and ~Γ0 = (Γ01, Γ02, Γ03) = const.
In section 3
we will consider a straight rod with an intrinsic twist ~Ω = {0, 0, Ω0} and
~Γ = {0, 0, Γ0}.

2 System for small amplitude waves

The point of discussion in this section is the propagation of the diﬀerent types
of a small amplitude waves. The results from this section are valid for any
shape in which the curvature of the rod is much greater than the wavelength
of the disturbance being propagated regardless of the intrinsic shape of the
rod.

Let us search as usual for the equilibrium point of the system (1-4) by
setting ~γ, ~Γ, ~ω and ~Ω to constants. It is easy to see that the equilibrium

point of equations (1-4) is ~γ = ~ω = 0, ~Γ = ~Γ0 and ~Ω = ~Ω0
suppose that each variable diﬀers slightly from the equilibrium value so we
retain only the linear terms in the equations. We allow ~Γ0 and ~Ω0 to be
functions of s and/or t. The linearized system (1-4) is:

possibly some other variants.

In the system (8-11) and further in this paper ~γ, ~Γ, ~ω and ~Ω denote the small
deviations from the equilibrium values.

In the usual manner we search for a solution to (8-11) using the har-
monic analysis. We assume that each variable depends of time and space
coordinates as follows:

(ω2I − k2D)~Ω⊥ = 0
(2ω2I − k2D3)Ω3 = 0

where the deﬁnitions used are:

~Γ⊥ ≡ (Γ1, Γ2, 0)

~Ω⊥ ≡ (Ω1, Ω2, 0)

Pay attention that these results were obtained for the arbitrary rod shape
because all terms that deﬁne the rod shape in equations (18-19) were omitted.
So, if wavelength tends to zero (is the least space parameter of the problem)
four wave types can propagate along the rod.

This treatment is for a rod with an arbitrary intrinsic shape. In the next
section we discuss the case of a rod that has no intrinsic twist, bend or shear.

3 Linear waves in the straight rod with no

intrinsic bend or shear.

Here we concentrate our attention on the case of the straight rod with no
intrinsic bend or shear. So in this section we will suppose that ~Ω0 = (0, 0, Ω0)
and ~Γ0 = (0, 0, Γ0). As we will see this case allows for a complete analytical
analysis for arbitrary wave length. Equations (8-11) in component form are:

It is easy to see that equations (33) and (39) (also (36) and (42)) are inde-
pendent from all other equations and describe the extension (twist) waves.
These two wave types will be discussed in the next two sections. As we will
see later bend and shear waves are also independent. These types we will
consider in the sections 3.3.

3.1 Sound (extension/compression) waves

From equations (33) and (39) it is easy to obtain two wave equations for the
extension/compression waves:

where p1,2 and q1,2 are arbitrary functions of s and t. The point to keep
in mind is that the amplitude of the sound waves must be small. It is easy
to see the movement follows directly from the equations (45) or (46). It is
clear that the arbitrary function p1 has the same value for all arguments

plane so p1 is constant along this line. The same statement holds for all

This is the velocity of propagation of harmonic waves in DNA according to
the linear approximation. In the linear approximation the amplitude of the
wave must be small, but it can have any wavelength.

3.2 Twist waves

In the same manner equations (36) and (42) yield two wave equations which

describe twist waves with velocity

are obtained:

similar to the propagation of sound waves, and the same remarks regarding
the wavelength and amplitude of the wave apply to twist waves as in the
previous section on sound waves.

However, twist velocity is diﬀerent from sound velocity because the con-

System (53-60) is linear so we seek a solution using harmonic analysis. As
in (12) we assume that each variable depends on space and time coordinates
as an harmonic wave:

Gi(s, t) = Gi0 · e−iωt + iks
where Gi(s, t) denotes one of the eight variables from the system of equations
(53-60) and Gi0 = const denotes its amplitude.

± sign under the radical splits the dispersion law into two sub-branches,
as indicated in Figure 1. These two sub-branches appear because of the
inhomogeneity of the rod in the axial direction. DNA is intrinsically twisted
(Ω0 6= 0). If the rod has no intrinsic twist (Ω0 = 0 ) then these two sub-
branches will coincide. For large k these two sub-branches diﬀer in frequency
by Ω0, which is the region of interest for modeling DNA (see below).

For a rod of inﬁnite length, any value of ω can be chosen that satis-
ﬁes equation (68), but for a rod of ﬁnite length there will be an additional
constraint that must be satisﬁed. If the rod is ﬁxed at both ends then the
usual restriction of having a node at each end applies. This introduces the
constraint L = (n/2)λ between the length of the rod, L, and the possible
wavelengths, λ, so that only discrete points along either sub-branch in Figure
1 will be observed.

3.3.2 The dispersion law for Shear waves

The second set of square brackets in equation (66) provides the dispersion
law for Shear Waves:

The above plot represents equations (68) and (70). The upper branch corresponds
to the plus sign before the radical, and the lower branch corresponds to the minus
sign before the radical. The dash line presents the dispersion law for the case
Ω0 = 0. For convenience dimensionless variables (marked by asterisk) are used:
in case of bend waves ω = ω∗Ω0
D/I and k = k∗Ω0 and in case of shear waves
ω = ω∗Ω0

C/ρ and k = k∗Ω0.

4 Conclusion.

The primary results are that, in the linear approximation, four diﬀerent
types of waves can propagate through a uniform elastic rod. These waves
correspond to extension(compression), twist, bend and shear. An extension
or twist wave will propagate without exciting other modes or changing shape.
Bend and shear waves behave rather diﬀerently. Each type obeys a dispersion
law that describes two additional sub-branches.

Utilizing constants suitable for DNA we ﬁnd that, in the limit of small
wavelengths, extension and bend propagate with a velocity of approximately
8˚A/ps and twist and shear propagate with a velocity of approximately 5˚A/ps.
Is is also signiﬁcant that the dispersion relation for bend and shear waves
is coupled with the inherent twist of DNA. We propose that these physi-
cal phenomena enable proteins interacting with DNA to accomplish highly
sophisticated tasks. For example the diﬀerence in extension and twist veloc-
ities can be utilized to measurement the distance between two points on the
DNA. Since the dispersion law for bend and shear waves depends on intrin-
sic twist, a mechanism for measuring DNA topology exists because of the
relation between twist, linking number and writhe. Other protein-protein
communications can certainly be established to assist other cellular mecha-
nisms.

4.1 Suggestion for a simulation experiment

We suggest a molecular dynamics simulation experiment to check the corre-
spondence between the linear theory of the propagation of waves in elastic
rods and an all atom simulation of DNA. In all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations of DNA the number of base pairs that can be simulated for a
signiﬁcant length of time is from tens to less than hundreds of base pairs.
For a simulation of DNA with ﬁxed ends it is suﬃcient to apply a sharp im-
pulse (δ function excitation) to one end of the DNA and measure the time of
propagation of this disturbance to the other end as a measure of the velocity

14

of extension/compression waves in DNA according to equation (28). The
propagation of twist can be similarly tested by applying a torque.

To measure dispersion one must make some simple calculations before the
simulation and then excite one end of the DNA with a driving force of the
appropriate frequency. In this manner a standing wave can be established in
the DNA. The wave frequency and wave number (2π/λ) are related by the
well known relation:

ω = VW avek

where ω = 2πf is the wave frequency, VW ave is the wave velocity and k =
2π/λ is the wavelength. In this case the wave length (wave number) is easy
to evaluate:

L = n

where n=1,2,3,..

λ

,

and f is the frequency of the driving oscillation. The values obtained from
simulation can be compared with the number obtained from formula (68 or
68) as a means of correcting our choice of constants.

We consider the eﬀect of asymmetric temporal delays in a system of two coupled Hopﬁeld neurons.
For couplings of opposite signs, a limit cycle emerges via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation when the
sum of the delays reaches a critical value. We show that the angular frequency of the limit cycle is
independent of an asymmetry in the delays. However, the delay asymmetry determines the phase
diﬀerence between the periodic activities of the two components. Speciﬁcally, when the connection
with negative coupling has a delay much larger than the delay for the positive coupling, the system
approaches in-phase synchrony between the two components. Employing variational perturbation
theory (VPT), we achieve an approximate analytical evaluation of the phase shift, in good agreement
with numerical results.

Synchronization phenomena among coupled systems
are abundant in nature [1, 2]. The coupling is often not
instantaneous; rather ﬁnite time delays exist.
In gen-
eral, time delays can cause an otherwise stable system to
oscillate [3, 4, 5] and may lead to bifurcation scenarios
resulting in chaotic dynamics [6, 7]. For coupled systems,
the question then arises, under what conditions two sys-
tems with delayed coupling can achieve synchrony.

A speciﬁc example from neuroscience provides a hint
how to approach this question. In the avian visual path-
way the optic tectum is reciprocally coupled with the
nucleus pars parvocellularis (Ipc), a subnucleus of the nu-
cleus isthmi [8]. The coupled systems, tectum and Ipc,
respond with synchronized oscillatory bursts to visual
stimulation [9]. Remarkably, the Ipc axons projecting
to the tectum are thick and myelinated (fast action po-
tential propagation), whereas tectal neurons projecting
to the Ipc possess comparatively thin axons and are un-
myelinated (slow action potential propagation) [8]. The
Ipc-to-tectum delay may thus be as short as a fraction
of a millisecond, whereas the delay for the tectum-to-Ipc
projection can be expected to be of the order of tens
of milliseconds. It therefore seems natural to conjecture
that the asymmetry in the delays may play a functional
role in the feedback system.

To explore this conjecture we investigate a model sys-
tem of two coupled Hopﬁeld neurons [10] with asymmet-
ric delays, described by the coupled ﬁrst-order delay dif-
ferential equations (DDE’s)

plings between the two neurons. The system of DDE’s
(1) has a trivial stationary point at u1 = u2 = 0, the
stability of which has been analyzed in detail, e.g., in
2 the ﬁxed point at the ori-
Ref. [11]. For a1a2 ≤ −

the origin becomes unstable and a limit cycle emerges via
p
a supercritical Hopf bifurcation at τ = τ0. Note that the
characteristic equation for the system (1), which deter-
mines the condition for a periodic solution to exist, only
depends on the sum of the two delays. A linear stability
analysis can thus provide no insight toward a possible
role of asymmetry in the delays. Furthermore, standard
methods for bifurcation analysis, as described, e.g., in
Refs. [6, 12] are only suitable for examining the nonlin-
ear dynamical system in the immediate neighborhood of
the bifurcation. In contrast to that, in this letter we aim
at obtaining results that also hold for large delays, i.e.,
far away from the bifurcation.

We ﬁrst investigate the eﬀect of asymetric time delays
through numerical simulations. For a subsequent per-
turbation expansion we deﬁne the expansion parameter
ǫ = √τ
τ0. Figure 1 shows numerical solutions of the
system of DDE’s (1) for diﬀerent values of the time de-
lays τ1 and τ2 and for the choice of parameters a1 =
1,
a2 = 2. The amplitude of the limit cycle is only deter-
mined by the value of ǫ and thus remains unchanged when
the temporal delays are chosen to be diﬀerent. However,
we observe that the phase between the periodic activi-
ties of u1(t) and u2(t) does depend on the asymmetry of
the delays. In order to quantify this phase diﬀerence, we
consider the normalized scalar product

Numerical results for this quantity are shown in Fig. 2.
We ﬁnd that for time delays which are equal or at least
not too asymmetric the scalar product φ is approximately
zero, which corresponds to a phase shift of π/2 between
u1(t) and u2(t), assuming that they can be described by
sinusoidal functions. However, when the delays are asym-
metric, the scalar product φ becomes larger in magni-
tude, being negative for τ1 > τ2 and positive for τ2 < τ1.
Speciﬁcally, for τ1 = 0 the scalar product approaches
unity for a growing delay τ2, corresponding to in-phase
synchronization between the the two components.

We now aim at achieving an approximative analyti-
cal calculation of φ. To this end, we ﬁrst derive the
perturbation series for the periodic solution u(t) and
its angular frequency ω of the system (1) by apply-
ing the Poincar´e-Lindstedt method [13]. Since a su-
percritical Hopf bifurcation occurs at τ = τ0, we as-
sume that the amplitude and frequency of the new
periodic states are analytic in ǫ and expand them as
u(t) = ǫU(t) = ǫ
and ω(ǫ) =
ω0 + ǫω1 + ǫ2ω2 + . . . . Furthermore, for convenience we
introduce the rescaled independent variable ξ = ω(ǫ)t
and write U(t) = V(ξ). The expansion then proceeds in
a way very similar to the approach in Ref. [14], where the
frequency of the limit cycle is calculated perturbatively
for increasing mean of time delays. However, we need to
introduce an additional parameter ˜τ1, which is deﬁned as
the τ1-value of the intersection point in the τ1-τ2 plane
between the line that marks the boundary between the
regions in which a periodic solution does or does not ex-

ist, and a line perpendicular to this boundary through a
given point (τ1, τ2). To nth order in ǫ, we have to solve
a system of diﬀerential equations of the form

where the inhomogeneity f (n)(ξ) is determined by the

impose certain conditions on the inhomogeneity f (n)(ξ).
Namely, we demand that f (n)(ξ) not contain terms that
would lead to non-periodic solutions for V(n)(ξ),
i.e.,
f (n)(ξ) must not contain secular terms. These condi-
tions, which can be derived by expanding both the nth

f (n)(ξ) into a Fourier series, read

while ω1 vanishes. This value is identical to the one found
in Ref. [14] depending only on ω0 and τ0 but not on τ1
or τ2. Since this observation holds to all orders, we thus
ﬁnd that the period of the oscillations is independent of
any asymmetry in the time delays. Furthermore, we ﬁnd
that only even perturbative orders lead to nonvanishing
contributions for both the angular frequency ω and the
limit cycle V(ξ), we therefore deﬁne the new expansion
parameter g = ǫ2. Denoting the expansion to order gN

Focussing on the choice of parameters a1 =
which lead to ω0 = 1, τ0 = π/4, we can determine the
expansion coeﬃcients for φ(N ) up to the third order. Fig-
ure 3 shows a comparison of our perturbative results and
the numerical result from Fig. 2. For small time de-
lays, the accuracy of the results from the perturbation
expansion is good and improves with increasing order.
However, as g increases, the perturbative results cease to
converge and no longer provide an acceptable approxi-
mation. As is typical for perturbative methods, our ap-
proach has yielded a divergent series. In order to improve
the quality of our results, we now perform a resumma-
tion of the perturbative expansion employing variational
perturbation theory (VPT).

VPT is a nonperturbative approximation scheme based
on a variational approach due to Feynman and Klein-
ert [15], which has been systematically developed over

the last few years, establishing its applicability in var-
ious ﬁelds of physics [14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. VPT
permits the evaluation of a divergent series of the form
N
f (N )(g) =
n=0 angn and yields a strong-coupling ex-
m=0 bmg−2m/q.
pansion of the generic form f (g) = gp/q
Here, p and q are real growth parameters characterizing
the strong-coupling behavior. The convergence of the se-
ries after resummation is exponentially fast and uniform
with respect to other system parameters such as temper-
ature, coupling constants, spatial dimensions, etc. [21].

In order to perform the resummation, one introduces
a variational parameter K for the perturbation series ac-
cording to Kleinert’s square-root trick [17]. The series is
thus transformed to the expression

derived in detail in Ref. [14]. The inﬂuence of the vari-
ational parameter K is then optimized according to the
principle of minimal sensitivity [22]; i.e., the optimized
value K (N ) is determined by solving for the roots of the
ﬁrst or higher derivatives of f (N )(g, K) with respect to
K. The N th order VPT approximation is then obtained
by evaluating (7) at this optimized value: f (N )
VPT(g) =
f (N )(g, K (N )). This variational result generally holds for
all values of the coupling constant g. Furthermore, by
considering the limit of large g, it allows the extraction
of the strong-coupling coeﬃcients bm.

In our case of the perturbation series for φ, the values
of the growth parameters p and q turn out to be the same
as those that we determined in Ref. [14] for the angular
frequency, namely p =
2, q = 2. Our ﬁrst-order result
after resummation then reads

FIG. 4: (Color) VPT results for the phase shift between u1(t) and u2(t). The ﬁrst color-coded plot shows the ﬁrst-order-VPT
result as given by (8). The three other plots show the diﬀerence between the numerical result and the results from the ﬁrst
three orders in VPT. For clarity, this diﬀerence has been augmented by a factor of 10 and 100 in the results for the ﬁrst and
for both the second and third order, respectively

The ﬁrst color-coded plot in Fig. 4 shows a graphical
representation of this result. The agreement with the
numerical result from Fig. 2 is excellent. While the sec-
ond VPT order provides a signiﬁcant improvement when
compared with the ﬁrst order result, third order results
are slightly superior to those of second order.

In conclusion, our investigation of a neuronal model
system shows that asymmetric temporal delays can con-
trol the phase in a feedback loop. Furthermore, after
a variational resummation of the perturbation series for
φ, we have a very accurate approximate result for this
quantity even in low orders and throughout the full τ1-τ2
plane.

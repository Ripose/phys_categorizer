Abstract

A molecular model is proposed of a bilayer consisting of fully saturated DPPC and mono unsat-

urated DOPC. The model not only encompasses the constant density within the hydrophobic core

of the bilayer, but also the tendency of chain segments to align. It is solved within self-consistent

ﬁeld theory. A model bilayer of DPPC undergoes a main chain transition to a gel phase, while a

bilayer of DOPC does not do so above zero degrees centigrade because of the double bond which

disrupts order. We examine structural and thermodynamic properties of these membranes and

ﬁnd our results in reasonable accord with experiment. In particular, order-parameter proﬁles are

in good agreement with NMR experiments. A phase diagram is obtained for mixtures of these

lipids in a membrane at zero tension. The system undergoes phase separation below the main-

chain transition temperature of the saturated lipid. Extensions to the ternary DPPC, DOPC, and

cholesterol system are outlined.

INTRODUCTION

The hypothesis that the lipids in the plasma membrane are distributed inhomogeneously

has received enormous attention. Small domains, known as “rafts”, rich in saturated lipids

and cholesterol, have been implicated in many biological processes including endocytosis,

transcription and transduction processes, and viral infection. The size and nature of such

domains in biological membranes is currently unclear1. The situation in model membranes,

however, is more transparent. Experimental studies in giant unilamellar vesicles2,3,4 con-

taining mixtures of saturated and unsaturated lipids and cholesterol, which mimic the com-

ponents of the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane, show the existence of at least three

phases; a saturated lipid-rich gel phase, a saturated lipid and cholesterol-rich liquid phase,

and an unsaturated lipid-rich liquid phase. The two liquid phases coexist in some regions

of the phase diagram. The sensitivity of the phase separation to the components and their

composition is demonstrated by the fact that mixtures of unsaturated lipids and choles-

terol, mimicking the components of the inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane, do not phase

separate5.

Theoretical consideration of mixtures of lipids and cholesterol have been carried out on

binary mixtures of saturated lipids and cholesterol using models in which the enormous

numbers of degrees of freedom of the lipids are severely reduced. In spite of this simpliﬁca-

tion, these models have demonstrated the importance of the preferential interaction between

cholesterol and saturated lipids in bringing about a “liquid ordered” phase in which the tails

are relatively well-ordered6,7.

It is our contention that two conditions are suﬃcient for bringing about coexistence

between a cholesterol and saturated lipid-rich liquid ordered phase and an unsaturated lipid-

rich “disordered liquid” in which the tails are typically disordered. The ﬁrst of these is

that the system be below the main-chain transition of the saturated lipid to its gel phase,

a transition driven by the ordering of the lipid tails. This transition is ﬁrst-order, and is

characterized by discontinuities in those thermodynamic quantities which are ﬁrst derivatives

of the free energy with respect to its arguments; e.g. the entropy, the area per head group,

etc. In particular, upon introduction of an unsaturated lipid, discontinuities arise in the areal

densities of the two lipids, ﬁrst derivatives of the free energy with respect to the chemical

potentials. In other words, phase separation between a saturated lipid-rich gel phase and

2

an unsaturated lipid-rich disordered liquid phase is a simple consequence of the main-chain

transition. The diﬀerence in component concentrations in the two phases is expected to be

large because the presence of the cis double bond causes the unsaturated chains to pack

poorly with the saturated chains that are well-ordered in the gel phase.

It also follows

from the ﬁrst-order nature of the main chain transition that the addition of cholesterol

to the saturated lipid will result in a phase separation between a saturated lipid-rich gel

phase and a liquid phase of lipid and cholesterol. Whether this liquid phase will coexist

with the disordered liquid phase or simply transform smoothly to it as the composition of a

ternary mixture changes depends on how diﬀerent the liquids are. Thus the second suﬃcient

condition for liquid-liquid phase separation is, as noted above, that the cholesterol favor

increased ordering of the saturated lipid tails, so that the disordered tails of the unsaturated

lipid will also tend to be expelled from the ordered ﬂuid causing coexistence between it and

an unsaturated-rich disordered ﬂuid.

In this paper, we consider a mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids within a bilayer

and show, as contended above, that below the main chain transition of the saturated lipid,

there is a demixing phase separation. We do this in a model in which the lipid tails are

treated microscopically according to the rotational isomeric states model of Flory8 which

permits each CH2 group to be in one of three conﬁgurations; the lowest energy trans, or

thermally excited gauche plus or gauche minus. In the latter, the chain conﬁguration exhibits

a kink. Due to thermal excitation and de-excitation, this kink is transient in contrast to

that in the unsaturated chain which is permanent. To model much of the eﬀect of the

interactions between the lipid segments, we follow early work9,10 and constrain the density

of the bilayer interior to be constant, equal to a value typical of its oily components. As

shown by these authors, imposition of this packing constraint causes the system to exhibit

a single disordered liquid phase, characterized by a certain average number of gauche bonds

per chain, and a certain area per chain. Larger areas could be attained by increasing the

average number of gauche bonds in the chains, but this increases the energy and free energy

of the system. Smaller areas could be attained by eliminating even more gauche bonds, but

this decreases the chain entropy to the point that the free energy again increases. Thus the

observed liquid phase occurs at an areal density at which an incremental decrease in entropy

of the chains is just compensated by an incremental reduction in energy of gauche bonds11.

The constant density constraint is not adequate to bring about the main-chain transition

3

to a gel phase, a transition which, we have argued, is one of the suﬃcient conditions for

raft formation.

In order to bring about both liquid and gel phases, we not only impose

the constant density constraint, but also include a local orientational interaction between

normals to the CH2 planes of adjacent chains, one which tends to align them. We expect

that inclusion of this explicit orientational interaction will capture the aligning tendency

of the inter-chain packing. Indeed we ﬁnd that this interaction does bring about a second

minimum in the free energy, one characterized by fewer gauche bonds than in the liquid

phase, and which we identify therefore, with the gel phase. In contrast to the liquid phase,

an incremental reduction in entropy of the more ordered chain conformations is compensated

here by an incremental decrease in orientational energy.

We ﬁrst consider a single component system of saturated tails consisting of ﬁfteen

monomeric segments, modeling those of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, (DPPC). We ﬁnd a

ﬁrst-order main chain transition at a temperature, Tm, and calculate the degree of segment

order as a function of position down the chain, and ﬁnd good agreement with experiment.

There is a concomitant change in area per head group as the chains lengthen in the gel

phase. Next, we apply our technique to a bilayer of unsaturated lipids. The unsaturated

chains we consider are seventeen monomeric units long, with a cis- double bond located be-

tween monomers eight and nine. This resembles the chain structure of dioleoylphosphatidyl-

choline, (DOPC). We ﬁnd no transition for bilayers composed only of this unsaturated lipid

above the melting point of water. Finally, we consider a mixture of these saturated and

unsaturated chains. At temperatures below Tm, the system phase separates into a saturated

lipid-rich gel phase and an unsaturated lipid-rich disordered liquid phase. Although there

is little experimental data on this mixture, we ﬁnd acceptable agreement with that which

exists.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce the theory for a

bilayer slab composed of a mixture of two lipid tails, one saturated and one unsaturated,

and also introduce the interaction we employ for this system. With these deﬁnitions, the

partition function for the full mixture is speciﬁed. It is then calculated within the framework

of self-consistent ﬁeld theory in Appendix I. Central to this theory are two self-consistent

equations which specify two local, eﬀective ﬁelds. The ﬁrst enforces the constant-density

constraint, and the second tends to align the local chain segment orientation. This subsection

is written for a general system of two lipid species, one with identical saturated tails, the other

4

with identical unsaturated tails. In the following subsection, we introduce the microscopic

model we use to describe the lipid tails.

In section III, the general theory is applied to two speciﬁc lipids, DOPC and DPPC.

We ﬁrst consider two diﬀerent pure bilayers, those composed of only one or the other of

these lipids. We present results pertinent to the main-chain transition in the DPPC bilayer

and some geometric, conformational, and thermodynamic statistics of these membranes

calculated in the context of our model. Of note are the deuterium order parameters for

these lipids since they indicate the acyl chain’s average conformation in the bilayer due to

packing with neighboring lipids. In the ﬁnal subsection, we present the phase diagram for the

system of mixed lipid bilayers and some conformational statistics calculated in this model.

II. THE MODEL AND ITS SELF-CONSISTENT FIELD SOLUTION

A. Theory

We consider a bilayer membrane of area A composed of Ns saturated and Nu unsaturated

lipids whose tails occupy a volume V , the total volume of the hydrophobic core of both bilayer

leaﬂets. Head groups are placed symmetrically, facing the external, aqueous environment

of solvent. Temporarily, we ignore all interactions between head groups and the solvent

molecules focusing only on the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. Acyl tails are tethered to

the glycerol backbone of the lipid head groups on both sides of the bilayer, and the ﬁrst

monomer segments extending from the backbone deﬁne the interfaces of the hydrophobic

core. The full width of this hydrophobic core, including both leaﬂets, is L. The system of

acyl tails comprising the hydrophobic core is treated as incompressible. This assumption

constrains the average density of monomers to a constant liquid-like value throughout the

bilayer. The total volume is simply the sum of all monomer volumes.

In the following, we limit our attention to lipids consisting of two identical tails. We

further simplify the system to that of a mixture of the individual, interacting chains rather

than a system of chain pairs extending from a common headgroup. This should make little

diﬀerence to the chain conformations because the chains are so tightly packed12.

The saturated lipid has the tail structure, P −(CH2)ns−1−CH3, which we model as a chain

of ns linked segments extending from the glycerol backbone labeled P . All monomers except

5

the last are CH2 segments with monomeric volumes νs(k) = ν0 = 28˚A3, k = 1, ns − 1. The
13,14,15. Other than
last monomer is a CH3 segment, which is assigned a volume νs(ns) = 2ν0
these volumes, the monomers are without structure, and spaced a bond length of l0 = 1.53˚A

apart. The microscopic monomer number density of the saturated lipid, averaged over the

plane of the bilayer, is

ˆΦs(z, Σ) =

ˆφs,γ(z, αγ),

ˆφs,γ(z, αγ) =

νs(k)δ(z − zk,γ(αγ)),

Ns

γ
X

Xk=1

where zk,γ(αγ) is the z coordinate of the k’th monomer of the γ’th saturated chain when

the chain is in the conﬁguration αγ. The circumﬂex denotes that a quantity depends upon
the lipid conﬁguration. Here the single chain density, ˆφs,γ, depends upon the single chain

conﬁguration αγ, and the total chain density, Φs depends upon the conﬁguration Σ of all the
lipids. For typographical convenience, we will simply write ˆΦs(z) henceforth, suppressing

the explicit dependence on the lipid conﬁgurations and allowing the circumﬂex to remind

the reader of this dependence. We average over the plane of the bilayer as we shall be

considering phases which are translationally invariant in this plane.

The unsaturated lipid tail is similarly constructed of nu linked monomers. It has the tail

structure P − (CH2)x − CH = CH − (CH2)y − CH3, which is a monounsaturated chain of

nu = x + 2 + y + 1 segments. Each CH2 and CH3 segment is assigned a volume identical to

that in the saturated lipid; each half of the −CH = CH− segment of the cis-unsaturated

bond is assigned a volume of νCH = 0.8ν0

14. The microscopic monomer number density of

the unsaturated lipid tails is, then,

with volume weights,

ˆΦu(z) =

With these monomer volumes, the total hydrophobic volumes of single DMPC, DPPC,
and DOPC lipids are 784˚A3, 896˚A3 and 985.6˚A3, respectively, which agree well with the
experimental values of 782˚A3, 913˚A3 and 984˚A3 for the ﬂuid phases15. We assume these

monomeric volumes have no dependence on temperature.

Much of the eﬀect of the long-range van der Waals attraction and hard core repulsion

is taken into account by the incompressibility constraint. This is clear from the agreement

between results obtained with this approximation and molecular dynamics simulation for

the liquid phases9,12. However an approximation based on density alone cannot capture the

enhanced alignment of the tails which drives the main chain transition. For this we will

need to know the local alignment of the chains. Our presumption is that the microscopic

interactions within the system favor those conﬁgurations in which the tails are more aligned

with one another because in such conﬁgurations the chains are more eﬃciently packed. We

shall include a pairwise interaction E between chains that reﬂects this assumption.

The local orientation of the chains is conveniently speciﬁed by the normal to the local

CH2 group. In particular, the normal to the plane determined by the k’th CH2 group on

chain γ can be written

uk,γ =

rk−1,γ − rk+1,γ
|rk−1,γ − rk+1,γ|

,

k = 1...ns − 1.

(6)

The position vector of the anchoring carbon of chain γ is denoted r0,γ. Subsequently we

shall refer to the uk,γ simply as “normals”, or “orientation vectors”.

It is now convenient to introduce a local density of these normals16 which, for the saturated

lipid is,

ˆΨs(z, u) =

νs(k)δ(z − zk,γ)δ(u − uk,γ).

Again the circumﬂex is a reminder that this density depends explicitly on the chain co-

ordinates zk,γ and normals uk,γ in a particular conﬁguration of lipids. There is a similar
expression, ˆΨu for the local density of normals coming from unsaturated chains.

A local pairwise interaction between tail segments which depends upon their orientations

can be written,

Here,

du denotes an integration over the full solid angle. It is important to note that all

interactions are local, i.e. between bonds, and are of the same form and strength irrespective

R

of the length or degree of unsaturation of the chains to which the bonds belong.

Because the normal to the plane of the bilayer, c, singles out a spatial direction, we

expect the interaction to depend upon the angles that the segments make with this normal

V (u, u′) = V (u′, u) → V (u · c, u′ · c). Irrespective of the particular form chosen for this

interaction, within the mean-ﬁeld approximation which we introduce shortly, the dependence

of the free energy of a single chain on the normal can only arise through functions of u · c. It

follows from this and the fact that the interaction energy, E, is pairwise that the free energy

of the system of chains can only depend upon a product of such functions. Anticipating

this, we take for the interaction a simple form which already exhibits this product nature,

V (u · c, u′ · c) ≈ −Jf (u · c)f (u′ · c) = −Jf (cos θ)f (cos θ′),

(9)

where f (cos θ) is normalized. Further, in the absence of headgroup interactions which we

have ignored, the chains will align normal to the plane of the bilayer which implies that

f (cos θ) be chosen a monotonically decreasing function of its argument. With this orienta-

tional interaction, the lowest energy conﬁguration of two neighboring orientational vectors

is one in which they avoid the penalty of hard-core interaction by both aligning with the

bilayer normal.

With this choice of orientational interaction, it is convenient to deﬁne

with a similar expression for the unsaturated lipid tails, so that the interaction energy can

be written in the transparent form,

For f (cos θ) we choose the simple functional form

which is approximately a Gaussian with width m−

2 . The prefactor is a normalization

coeﬃcient. If the interaction, Eq. (12), were not local but were an average over the lipid

chain, and if m were unity in the expression above, then this interaction would be comparable

to the leading order term of the interaction Marcelja17 considered for saturated lipids. The

local form, and higher power dependence of the alignment with the bilayer normal was ﬁrst

considered by Gruen10.

Two parameters determine this interaction between segments, its strength J and its

angular range. The former is set by requiring that the main-chain transition temperature

for the chains under consideration agree with experiment. The latter may be estimated by

considering the average angular alignment of an acyl tail in the bilayer. Crudely, a lipid in

the bilayer is, on average, conﬁned to a cylindrical shape. A simple estimate of its alignment
2 /¯l, where ¯a is an average cross-sectional area for an acyl
with the normal is then θ0 ∼ ¯a
chain and ¯l is an average length in a typical membrane leaf. Comparison of the Gaussian

1

width to this estimate, leads to m ∼ 14 − 18. We use m = 18 in our calculations.

Now that the interactions between chains are deﬁned, the Helmhotlz free energy of the

system, subject to the incompressibility constraint of constant density, can be obtained

within self-consistent, or mean ﬁeld, theory. This is done in Appendix I with the result

b(z) = −βJ[ρs < ˆξs(z) >s +ρu < ˆξu(z) >u].

(18)

(19)

The ﬁrst of these enforces the incompressibility constraint.

Note that, because of the incompressibility constraint, the volume is not an independent

variable so that the Helmholtz free energy, Eq. (14), depends only on the temperature, the

numbers of each lipid, and the area. The interpretation of the free energy is straightforward.

The ﬁrst two terms are simply the single chain Gibbs free energies multiplied by the number

of chains per unit area. As is well known, these terms double-count the pairwise interaction

energy, and this is corrected by the third term. The next two terms are the entropy of

mixing, and the last is simply −βpV /A which relates the Gibbs free energy of the preceding

terms to a Helmholtz free energy.

Other than excluding tail conﬁgurations protruding into the solvent region, the eﬀects

of the aqueous medium and head groups have thus far been neglected. It is evident that

the interfacial eﬀects can also be somewhat complex. For example, tilted solid phases are

often attributed to a mismatch between a smaller average areal footprint of the packed tails

and a larger headgroup. On the other hand, a small headgroup mismatched with larger,

ﬂuid-like tails attached to it can yield costly interfacial interactions between the solvent and

the hydrophobic core, resulting in a large interfacial tension. These eﬀects are beyond the

scope of our calculation. However, so as not to overlook the contributions from the head

groups completely, we choose a minimal model for them.

Ignoring the molecular details of the head groups and their interactions with the aqueous

environment, we focus on two physical attributes that result from these interactions. The

ﬁrst is an interfacial energy per unit area, which we include as a simple phenomenological

form, γ0A. Thus the total free energy per unit area is

fA(T, ρs, ρu) = Fmf t/A + γ0,

(20)

where Fmf t is given in Eq. (14). The value of γ0 is taken to be on the order of the energy
per unit area of an oil-water interface. We use γ0 = 0.12kBT /˚A2 in our calculations, which

is roughly the experimental value. The second eﬀect attributable to the head groups is the

10

rigidity they provide the acyl tail. The lipid tails are tethered to the glycerol backbone,

providing a ﬁxed endpoint for the chain. The head groups tend to order the ﬁrst segments

of the lipid tethered there, an eﬀect which we model by a surface ﬁeld that couples to the
ﬁrst bond of the lipid. To model this, we include in ˆH1 a surface ﬁeld term η cos(u1 · c).

The magnitude of the surface ﬁeld η is tuned so that the average angle of the ﬁrst bond is

approximately equal to that obtained from NMR measurements for the lipid.

B. Microscopic Model

To evaluate the single lipid partition function in external ﬁelds, Eq. (17) above, we specify

a microscopic model suitable for describing the noninteracting single chain conﬁgurations
and their energy, ˆH1. To this end, we employ Flory’s Rotational Isomeric States (RIS)
model8 for the lipid acyl chains. This model places a subsequent monomer in the acyl chain

at one of three discrete possible orientations from its ancestor segment; the trans, gauche

plus, and gauche minus orientations. According to this model, the gauche bonds are local
excitations that contort the chain and increase the energy by ǫg = 500 cal/mol. Thus ˆH1

of a given conﬁguration is simply equal to ǫg multiplied by the number of gauche bonds

in that conﬁguration, and also includes the contribution from the surface ﬁeld described

above. The lipid conformation with all trans bonds is a highly stretched chain, whereas a

lipid tail with several gauche bonds is coiled. Given the location of the ﬁrst bond in the

acyl chain, all positions of the subsequent ns − 1 generations are determined by this model,

which locates segments in a tetrahedral fashion, with skeletal angles of 112◦, and dihedral

angles of {0◦, ±120◦} for trans and gauche± orientations respectively. Without restrictions

on this set, there are 3ns−1 conﬁgurations for each ﬁxed, ﬁrst bond orientation.

The cis- double bond in the unsaturated chains slightly modiﬁes this model. This bond

is a quenched defect in the chain, eﬀectively placing a kink in the tail about the location

of the double bond. The energies and conﬁgurations of the segments adjoining the double

bond as well as the −C = C− bond length diﬀer slightly from the saturated links. For

the segments associated with the double bond, we employ the RIS conﬁgurational model of

cis-1,4-polybutadiene18, which possesses the same atomic structure as the double bonds in

these lipid chains.

We also impose several restrictions on the lipid conﬁgurations that reduce the number

11

of allowed ones signiﬁcantly. First of all, conﬁgurations that protrude into the aqueous en-

vironment are discarded. A conﬁguration with any two, non-consecutive monomer centers

less than a bond width apart is considered self-intersecting and also discarded. Conﬁgura-

tions with consecutive gauche minus (plus), gauche plus (minus) bond sequences have large

hydrogen-hydrogen steric overlaps8, a phenomena referred to as the “pentane eﬀect.” These

conﬁgurations are also neglected. Each single lipid partition function is then evaluated by

enumerating all allowed conﬁgurations in the RIS model, from many diﬀerent ﬁrst bond ori-

entations and locations. It should be noted that two diﬀerent ﬁrst segment orientations will

have diﬀerent numbers of conﬁgurations stemming from them since they will have diﬀerent

number of conﬁgurations that penetrate the aqueous environment.

We specify in Appendix II how the probability distributions Ps and Pu and the single

lipid partition functions, Eq. (17), are calculated within the context of the RIS model and

the conﬁgurational restrictions. We also discuss there a few other details of the calculation

of the free energy.

III. RESULTS

A. Single component DPPC and DOPC bilayers

We ﬁrst apply our method to a tensionless bilayer composed only of DPPC lipids. We

solve the self-consistent equations for a given temperature and under the condition that

the surface tension be zero. The high temperature liquid phase undergoes a main chain

transition to a low temperature gel phase, and by adjusting the interaction strength J, we

set this transition temperature at Tm ∼ 315 K, essentially the experimental one19. The value

of J remains ﬁxed at this value throughout all subsequent calculations. In Fig. 1 we show

the Helmholtz free energy per two-chain lipid

in units of kBT plotted vs. the area per two-chain lipid, 2A/Ns = 2as, at the temperature

of the main chain transition. It is straight forward to show that

with S the total entropy. The two minima in the ﬁgure occur at the areal densities of the

two coexisting phases. Because these states are minima of the free energy per lipid, their

surface tensions vanish, as seen from Eq. (23). Further as they have the same free energy

per lipid at zero surface tension, they have the same chemical potential, as seen from Eq.

(22). Thus these phases are indeed at coexistence. The main chain transition is clearly seen

to be ﬁrst order, marked by a discontinuous jump in the area per lipid. Table I summarizes

a few geometric aspects of each state and of the transition. We ﬁnd satisfactory agreement

with experiment for the geometric properties. The ﬂuid phase is characterized by a greater

area per lipid than is the gel phase. The hydrophobic width of the bilayer is thinner, ﬁlled

with coiled lipid tails with, on average, somewhat more than four gauche bonds per tail.

The gel state consists of more ordered lipid chains that are tightly packed, having a smaller

area per lipid and fewer gauche bonds.

One thermodynamic quantity that is sensitive to the packing in the hydrophobic core

is the deuterium “SCD” order parameter proﬁle, which is commonly measured in the ﬂuid

state by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. The calculated deuterium order

parameter for our model DPPC bilayer is shown in Fig. 2 for both ﬂuid and gel states. The

ﬂuid phase is compared to experimental data from20. Collective organization of the lipid

tails during the transition from the ﬂuid to gel state is indicated by the large jump in chain

alignment. Experiment and simulation distinguish sn − 1 and sn − 2 lipid tails, which we

do not, so the calculated proﬁles in Fig. 2 should be considered as an average over both

acyl tails. Comparing to experiment, we see that the calculated ﬂuid phase is slightly more

disordered than the experimental one.

Applying our calculational method to a bilayer consisting only of mono-unsaturated,

DOPC model lipids, we ﬁnd a ﬂuid phase and no transition above the freezing point of

water. This result is consistent with experiment, which indicates a transition temperature
for DOPC of Tm ∼ 250 K. The calculated ﬂuid state has an area per lipid of 67.2˚A2 and a
hydrophobic width of 29.3˚A. This lipid area is somewhat smaller than the experimental value
of 72.5˚A2 with also a thinner hydrophobic width of 27.1˚A. The calculated deuterium order

parameter is shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that these proﬁles are calculated for a lower

temperature, T = 305 K, than the saturated lipids. The order parameter displays a notch

in the proﬁle about the cis- double bond, one which is also seen in MD simulation21,22,23.

Also, there is a slight even-odd eﬀect in the order parameter which we do not observe in the

13

saturated chains.

B. Composite bilayers of DPPC and DOPC

From the calculation of the free energy, Eq. (14), the phase behavior for a mixture of

both lipids, DPPC and DOPC, can be determined. Phase coexistence is determined by

examining the auxiliary function,

˜γ = min
ρs,ρu

{fA − λsρs − λuρu} .

(24)

When the λs and λu are adjusted so that ˜γ exhibits two minima with the same value of

˜γ, then there is two-phase coexistence. At this point, the values of λs, λu are equal to the

values of the chemical potentials of the saturated and of the unsaturated lipids, µs and µu,

in the coexisting phases and ˜γ is equal to the surface tension, γ, of each phase. We further

require that this surface tension be zero in each phase as there is no constraint on the bilayer

area. The four requirements that the chemical potentials and surface tension be equal in

each phase and that the tension be zero determines the two areal densities, ρs and ρu, in

each of the two phases. Note that the bare surface tension, γ0, causes the system to contract

to the point at which the tension due to packing just counteracts the bare tension leaving a

net tension of zero.

The calculated phase diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 3. For small concentrations

of DOPC, we ﬁnd a gel state rich in DPPC below the main-chain transition temperature.

A region of ﬂuid/gel coexistence is found which is rather wide because of the poor packing

of the unsaturated lipids. These results are in reasonable agreement with experiment24.

The deuterium order parameters for the two coexisting phases at T = 293 K are shown

in Fig.

4. The gel phase shows signiﬁcant ordering of both lipids, given by the large

absolute magnitude of both order parameters. The disordering eﬀect of the double bond

is more prominent in the ordered phase, with aﬀected bonds showing a large notch. This

is noteworthy because it implies that the tight packing about the unsaturated lipids in

the ordered phase tends to enhance the disorder about the unsaturated bond. The order

parameters in the liquid-crystalline phases are also shown in Fig. 4.

IV. SUMMARY

We have formulated a microscopic model of a bilayer consisting of lipids, one which

incorporates two important eﬀects of the interactions between chains; the tendency of the

chains to create an incompressible hydrophobic interior, and their cooperative tendency to

order. The solution of the model obtained from self-consistent ﬁeld theory reproduces many

salient features of the lipid bilayer. The system of chains which mimic DPPC undergoes a

ﬁrst-order main chain transition from a disordered ﬂuid state to a more ordered gel phase,

a transition characterized by a reduction in the number of gauche bonds and the area per

chain. The ordering of the chains in the liquid phase as determined by the deuterium

order parameter is in rather good agreement with experiment. We have also calculated the

deuterium order parameter in the gel phase.

We then applied the model to a system mimicking the mono-unsaturated chains of DOPC.

Utilizing the same interaction as before, we ﬁnd that this system does not undergo a main

chain transition above zero degrees centigrade, a result in agreement with experiment. The

lowering of the main-chain transition is due to the double bond in the chain which disrupts

the tendency to order. The deuterium order parameter proﬁles for this system show the

characteristic reduction at the position of the double bond.

Lastly we examined a mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids and showed that the

system phase separates into a saturated-lipid-rich gel phase and an unsaturated-lipid-rich

liquid phase at temperatures below the main-chain transition temperature of the saturated

lipid. The separation arises from the ﬁrst-order main chain transition. The large diﬀerence

in areal densities is due to the lipid architecture; the unsaturated lipids are rejected from

the gel phase because they do not pack into it very well.

Several pieces of physics have been ignored in our calculation, such as the explicit inter-

action between head groups and, of course, the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations. We expect that such

eﬀects will alter the speciﬁc values of thermodynamic quantities, but not the main phenom-

ena. In particular the phase separation into a saturated-rich gel and an unsaturated -rich

liquid phase will remain below the main chain transition of the saturated lipid. As noted

earlier, this is important as this behavior is one of two ingredients for a suﬃcient theory of

liquid-liquid coexistence in a ternary mixture which includes cholesterol. We are currently

investigating the role of this third component within the framework of our model.

deﬁned previously in Eq. (2), the trace is over all conﬁgurations of a single saturated chain,

and the index specifying the particular chain has been dropped. The expressions for Pu and

Qu are essentially the same except that the segment volumes are those of the unsaturated

chain, and the trace is over its conﬁgurations. Note that because

T r{α}Ps = 1,

(34)

and similarly for Pu, and because the sum in the normalization of the exact probability

distribution, Eq. (26), is over all distinct states, the factor of Ns!Nu! is needed in Eq. (28)

so that the normalization will be satisﬁed within the mean ﬁeld approximation.

The Helmholtz free energy of Eq. (25) can now be obtained directly within the mean

ﬁeld approximation of Eq. (28). One obtains

− [ρs ln Qs + ρu ln Qu] + ρs ln Ns + ρu ln Nu,

where ρs ≡ Ns/A and ρu ≡ Nu/A are the areal densities of saturated and unsaturated chains,

< ˆφs >s≡ T r{α}Ps ˆφs,

and similarly for the other single-chain ensemble averages. Again chain indices have been

dropped.

The unknown ﬁelds Π(z), Bs(z), and Bu(z) are obtained from three conditions. The ﬁrst

is that the interior of the bilayer be incompressible which implies

ρs < ˆφs(z) >s +ρu < ˆφu(z) >u= 1.

The second and third are that the free energy be an extremum with respect to the undeter-
mined functions < ˆξs >s and < ˆξu >u. This leads to the equations

Bs(z) = Bu(z)

We shall denote the functions which satisfy the self-consistent Eqs. (37) to (39) as π(z) and

b(z) respectively.

Substituting the ﬁelds π(z) and b(z) into the free energy, one obtains

The ﬁrst two terms are simply the single chain Gibbs free energies multiplied by the number

of chains per unit area. (They are Gibbs free energies as the pressure-like π is the independent

variable.) These terms double-count the pairwise interaction energy, and this is corrected

by the third term. The fourth and ﬁfth terms are the entropy of mixing. Thus the ﬁrst

ﬁve terms are the mean ﬁeld approximation for the Gibbs free energy per unit area of the

system. The last term is simply −βpV /A, with p the pressure, and relates the Gibbs free

energy to the Helmholtz free energy.

The contribution of the entropy of mixing can be put in a more convenient form as follows.

VII. APPENDIX II. THE RIS DISTRIBUTION

This section clariﬁes how the sums over single lipid conﬁgurations, which are needed

to evaluate single lipid ensemble averages, Eq. (15), are carried out within the rotational

18

isomeric states (RIS) model, and how the calculation of thermodynamic quantities is accom-
plished. In the RIS model8, the bond between the carbon at position rk−1 and rk , k ≥ 2,

can be in one of three conﬁgurations, the lowest energy trans or the gauche plus or gauche

minus with an energy higher than that of the trans by an amount ǫg. There can be no gauche

bond between the anchoring carbon and the ﬁrst carbon in the chain by deﬁnition. Further

an apparent gauche bond between the ﬁrst and second carbons can actually be obtained by

a solid body rotation of a trans conﬁguration. Within the RIS model, the sequence of bond

orientations down the chain, the location of the anchoring carbon, z0, and the orientation

of the ﬁrst normal, u1, completely deﬁne the conﬁguration of the chain.

The probability distribution, Eq. (29), of a saturated chain in conﬁguration α can now

be written

νs(k)

where η is the surface ﬁeld introduced earlier which couples to the ﬁrst normal, and gk

equals unity if the bond between the carbon at rk−1 and rk is gauche, and zero otherwise.

For unsaturated lipids, the cis-unsaturated bond alters the bond weights. These energetic

weights and conﬁgurational properties are speciﬁed in Mark18.

Not all possible bond conﬁgurations in a chain are acceptable. Those in which a gauche

minus immediately follows a gauche plus or vice versa have large steric overlaps8, and are

discarded. Further those conﬁgurations in which the chain intersects itself are also discarded

as are those in which the chain pierces the aqueous plane and enters the region of solvent.

19

To carry out the sum over single lipid conﬁgurations, we ﬁrst enumerate all conﬁgurations

of the chains within the RIS model for a given position of the ﬁrst monomer and orientation

of the ﬁrst bond. Under this constraint, the RIS conﬁgurations of these lipids are generated

once and stored in a linked list with a tree structure. This structure allows us to store a large

number of conformations and perform conﬁgurational sums using roughly a quarter of the

number of operations required by a linear storage array. We then sample orientations and

translations of this ﬁrst bond by rotating it about the bilayer normal and then translating the

chain along the bilayer normal. In particular we consider rotations of the lipid conﬁgurations

as a solid body, sampling two Euler angles: that to the aqueous plane from the normal, θ,

and φ, and about the body axis.

Translations of the whole chain normal to the bilayer are chosen in a small interval
{−∆z, ∆z}, with ∆z ∼ 1.5˚A, about the aqueous plane. We choose the ﬁrst segments of the

chains to originate at one of four evenly spaced locations in this window about the aqueous

plane, matching a discretization of the bilayer we employ, described below. The allowed

Euler rotations about the ﬁrst bond varies with these origins. For example, the maximally

inserted chains in this translational grid have somewhat more than the hemisphere of allowed

rotations without penetrating the aqueous environment, whereas the maximally extracted

ones have less than the hemisphere.

For each of these origins in the translational window, we sample the allowed solid angles.

Using a shorter saturated lipid, 12 or 14 segments long, as a benchmark, we may sample

both Euler angles exhaustively. A large uniform sampling, (∼ 3500 total angles), indicates

the dense phase has a preference for two orientations, θ ∼ 0, corresponding to the ﬁrst

bond in the trans state, and to a lesser extent, θ ∼ 60◦ corresponding to a ﬁrst bond

gauche isomerization. Since such an exhaustive sampling of angles for longer lipids is not

computationally feasible, we must substantially reduce the number of angles sampled.

One way of accomplishing this is to utilize a set of angles determined from equidistant

points on a sphere. This accomplishes a uniform density distribution on the sphere, each an-

gle subtending nearly the same portion of the total solid angle. These angles are determined

from a simulation of repulsive points conﬁned to a sphere. We then increase the density

of conﬁgurations for small θ, until we nearly reproduce the statistics from the exhaustive

sampling above. In order to correct for the bias imposed in the selection of angles, we weight

each of them by a factor proportional to the amount of the total allowable solid angle they

20

subtend. The dense set of angles near θ ∼ 0 each subtend a smaller amount of area and

have a smaller weight.

With these rotations and translations, and discarding self-intersecting and other restricted

conﬁgurations, the complete computational set includes on the order of 107 conﬁgurations

for roughly 150 total initial bond angles for each lipid species.

To determine ensemble averages of position dependent quantities, such as

of Eq. (2) or

ˆφs,γ(z, zk,γ) =

νs(k)δ(z − zk,γ),

ns

Xk=1

ˆξs,γ(z) =

νs(k)δ(z − zk,γ)f (uk,γ · c),

ns−1

Xk=1

(46)

(47)

of Eq. (11), we discretize the space of the continuous variable z into 2Nz levels zl of width

δz = L/2Nz. A saturated chain which is without gauche defects and which is aligned

with the bilayer normal sets a limiting, maximal half-width, L/2, for the hydrophobic core

of a one-component lipid bilayer. Typically, we divide the hydrophobic width into slices
δz ∼ 0.75˚A to achieve a suitable resolution for our calculations. The width of the bilayer is

then altered by changing the number of slices, 2Nz, but maintaining the slice width δz. By

changing the bilayer thickness incompressibly, we simply vary the average areal density of

the lipids. This discretization of z aﬀects the accuracy of the calculation of the SCD order

parameter, particularly in the gel phase. We estimate the uncertainty in the order parameter

in this phase as ±0.02.

The calculation is now straightforward. For given surface compositions ρs and ρu and
temperature T , the densities < ˆφs(zl) >s, < ˆφu(zl) >u, < ˆξs(zl) >s, and < ˆξs(zl) >s are

evaluated in the ensemble with the probability distribution Ps of Eq. (16) or Pu containing

given ﬁelds π(zm) and b(zm). These ﬁelds must satisfy the self-consistent equations, Eqs.

(18) and (19), which contain the densities. This set of coupled, nonlinear, equations can be

solved using a standard algorithm. Due to the mirror symmetry of the bilayer, it is suﬃcient

to solve the self-consistent equations in the half-bilayer. To do this, chain interdigitation

must be correctly accounted for in lipid conﬁgurations that extend past the midplane into

the other leaf. If the conﬁguration is long enough to interdigitate the other leaf, its monomer

densities are reﬂected and the ‘image’ of the conﬁguration counted in the statistics. The

free energy, Eq. (14), is then calculated from which all thermodynamic information may be

derived.

21

The parameters we have chosen for the calculations below are as follows. The saturated

lipid chains we consider are ns = 15 monomers long, mimicking DPPC. An interaction of

strength J/Tm = 0.059 induces the main-chain transition at its observed value of Tm = 315

K. The unsaturated lipids have nu = 17 monomers with a cis-9 double bond, between the

eighth and ninth segments. This is the chain structure of DOPC. For both species of lipid,

we ﬁnd a surface ﬁeld of η/kBTm ∼ 1.04 suﬃcient to obtain reasonable values of the order

parameter for bonds nearest the aqueous plane.

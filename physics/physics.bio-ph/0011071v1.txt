According to the experimental evidence damage induced by
densely ionizing radiation in mammalian cells is distributed
along the DNA molecule in the form of clusters. The most
critical constituent of DNA damage are double-strand breaks
(DSBs) which are formed when the breaks occur in both DNA
strands and are directly opposite or separated by only a few
base pairs. The paper discusses a model of clustered DSB
formation viewed in terms of compound Poisson process along
with the predictive assay of the formalism in application to
experimental data.

I. INTRODUCTION

In living cells subjected to ionizing radiation many
chemical reactions are induced leading to various bio-
logical eﬀects such as mutations, cell lethality or neo-
plastic transformation [1,2]. The most important tar-
get for radiation induced chemical transformation where
these changes can be critical for cell survival is DNA dis-
tributed within the cell’s nucleus. Nuclear DNA is orga-
nized in a hierarchy of structures which comprise the cel-
lular chromatin. The latter is composed of DNA, histones
and other structural proteins as well as polyamines. Or-
ganization of DNA within the chromatin varies with the
cell type and changes as the cell progresses through the
cell cycle. Ionizing radiation produces variety of damage
to DNA including base alterations and single- and double
strand breaks (DSBs) in the sugar-phosphate backbone
of the molecule [1,3]. Single strand breaks (SSBs) are
eﬃciently repaired with high ﬁdelity and probably con-
tribute very little to the loss of function of living cells.
On the other hand, DSBs are believed to be the critical
lesions produced in chromosomes by radiation; interac-
tion between DSBs can lead to cell killing, mutation or
carcinogenesis. The purpose of theoretical modeling of
radiation action [4]– [7] is to describe qualitatively and
quantitatively the results of radiobiological eﬀects at the
molecular, chromosomal and cellular level. The basic
consideration in such an approach must be then descrip-
tive analysis of breaks in DNA caused by charged particle
tracks and by the chemical species produced.
Production of DSBs in intracellular DNA can be stud-
ied by use of the pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
[8] in which the gel electrophoresis is applied to elute

1

high molecular weight DNA fragments from whole cel-
lular DNA embedded in an organic gel (agarose). Two
main approaches of this technique are usually applied.
One is the measurement of the fraction of DNA leaving
the well in PFGE, i.e. the amount of DNA smaller than
a certain cutoﬀ size deﬁned by the electrophoretic condi-
tions. This method has proven to be very sensitive, allow-
ing reproducible measurements at relatively low doses.
The second approach is to describe fragment-size distri-
butions obtained after irradiation as a function of dose,
taking advantage of the property of PFGE to separate
DNA molecules based on how quickly they reorient in
a switching (pulsed) electrical ﬁeld. The major goal of
the experiments is to quantify number of induced DSBs
based on changes in the amount of DNA or the average
fragment size in response to dose.
In both cases data
obtained are related to average number of DSBs. To an-
alyze the data, the formalism describing random depolar-
ization of polymers of ﬁnite size is usually adopted [9,10]
giving very well ﬁts to experimental results with X-ray
induced DNA fragmentation. In contrast to the ﬁndings
for sparsely ionizing irradiation (X and γ rays) charac-
terized by low average energy deposition per unit track
length (linear energy transfer, LET≈ 1 keV/µm), the
densely ionizing (high LET) particle track is spatially lo-
calized [2,11]. In eﬀect, multiplicity of ionizations within
the track of heavy ions can produce clusters of DSBs
on packed chromatin [13]. The formation of clusters de-
pends on chromatin geometry in the cell and radiation
track structure.
DSBs multiplicity and location on chromosomes may
determine the distribution of DNA fragments detected
in PFGE experiments. Modeling DNA fragment-size-
distributions provides then a tool which allows to elu-
cidate experimentally observed frequencies of fragments.
Even without detailed information on the geometry of
chromatin, models of radiation action on DNA can serve
with some predictive information concerning measured
DNA fragment-size-distribution. The purpose of the
present paper is to discuss a model which can be used in
analysis of DNA fragment-size- distribution after heavy
ion irradiation. The background of the model is the Pois-
son statistics of radiation events which lead to formation
of clusters of DNA damage. The formation of breaks to
DNA can be then described as the generalized or com-
pound Poisson process for which the overall statistics of
damage is an outcome of the random sum of random

variables (Section 2). Biologically relevant distributions
are further derived and used (Section 3) in description of
fragment size distribution in DNA after irradiation with
heavy ions. Practical use of the formalism is discussed
by ﬁtting the distributions to experimental data.

II. RANDOM SUMS OF RANDOM VARIABLES
AND COMPOUND POISSON DISTRIBUTIONS

Consider [14,15] a sum SN of N independent random

variables X

SN =

Xi

(2.1)

where N is a random variable with a probability gener-
ating function g(s)

g(s) =

gisi

(2.2)

and Xi are i.i.d. variables (independent and sampled
from the same distribution) whose generating function
f (s) is

N

Xi=1

∞

Xi=0

∞

Xj=1

E[SN ] = µν,

V ar[SN ] = νσ2 + µ2τ 2

(2.6)

The above compound distribution is describing “clus-
tered statistics” of events grouped in a number N of
clusters which itself has a distribution. As such, it is
sometimes described in literature [16] as “mixture of dis-
tributions”. Out of many interesting biological applica-
tions of compound distributions [17]- [20], a special class
constitute Poisson point processes which can be also an-
alyzed in terms of random sums with Poisson distributed
random events N .
It can be shown that a mixture of
Poisson distributions resulting from using any unimodal
continuous function f (λ) is a unimodal discrete distribu-
tion. It is not so, however, in case of unimodal discrete
mixing.
In particular, mixtures of Poisson-Poisson or
Poisson-binomial, known in literature as Neyman distri-
butions [21] can exhibit strongly multinomial character.
By virtue of the above formalism and by using the for-
mulae (2.5) , the generating function of the compound
Poisson-Poisson distribution is:

g = exp(−λ(1 − f (s)))

(2.7)

where the random variables Xi are distributed according
to a Poisson law

f (s) = exp(−µ + µs)

(2.8)

f (s) =

fjsj

(2.3)

and the total SN is a random variable with a compound
Poisson-Poisson (Neyman type A) distribution:

By use of the Bayes rule of conditional probabilities the
probability that SN takes value j can be then written as

P (SN = x) ≡ P (x; µ, λ) =

∞

XN =0

(N µ)xe−N µ
x!

λN e−λ
N !

(2.9)

P (SN = j) ≡ hj =

P (SN = j|N = n)P (N = n) (2.4)

for which the mean and variance are given by

∞

Xn=0

For ﬁxed value of n and by using the statistical inde-
pendence of Xi’s, the sum SN has a probability gener-
ating function F (s) being a direct product of f (s), i.e.
∞
F (s) = f (s)n =
j=0 Fjsj from which it follows that
P (SN = j|N = n) = Fj. The formula (2.4) leads then
to the compound probability generating function of SN
given by

P

Xj=0

h(s) =

=

Fjgnsj =

∞

∞

Xj=0

Xn=0

=

gnf (s)n ≡ g{f (s)}

(2.5)

∞

Xn=0

Conditional expectations rules can be used to determine
moments of a random sum. Given E[N ] = ν, E[Xi] = µ,
V ar[N ] = τ 2 and V ar[Xi] = σ2, the ﬁrst and the second
moment of the random sum SN are

2

E[x] = µλ,

V ar[x] = λµ(1 + µ)

(2.10)

The resulting distribution can be interpreted as a mix-
ture of Poisson distribution with parameter N µ where
N (number of clusters) is itself Poisson distributed with
parameter λ. Figures 1,2 present function (2.9) for two
various sets of parameters λ, µ.

The compound Poisson distribution (CPD) has a wide
application in ecology, nuclear chain reactions and que-
ing theory [4,19–21]. It is sometimes known as the distri-
bution of a “branching process” and as such has been
also used to describe radiobiological eﬀects of densely
ionizing radiation in cells [17,22–24]. When a single
heavy ion crosses a cell nucleus, it may produce DNA
strand breaks and chromatin scissions wherever the ion-
izing track structure overlaps chromatin structure. The
multiple yield of such lesions depends on the radial distri-
bution of deposited energy and on the microdistribution
of DNA in the cell nucleus. The latter and the geome-
try of DNA coiling in the cell nucleus determine number
of crossings, the “primary” incidents leading to DSBs
production. By assuming for a given cell line, a “typi-
cal” average number n of possible crossings per particle

which diﬀers by a factor (1 − qn) in the exponent from
the surviving fraction for a Poisson distribution:

PP (0|σ, F, n) = exp[−σF ] = exp[−E[i]]

(2.15)

traversal, the distribution of the number of chromatin
breaks i can be modelled by a binomial law:

PN (0|σ, F, n) =

P (i|n) =

n
i (cid:19)

(cid:18)

piq(n−i)

(2.11)

where p is a probability that a chromatin break occurs
at each particle crossing (and q is the probability that
it does not). The overall probability that i lesions will
be observed after m independent particles traversed the
nucleus is given by [4]

P(i|σ, F, n) =

∞

Xm=1

(nm)!piq(nm−i)(σF )me−σF

(2.12)

which is a compound Neyman type B distribution ob-
tained as a random Poisson sum of binomially distributed
i.i.d variables.
In the above presentation the average
number of particles crossing the cell nucleus λ is pro-
portional to the absorbed energy (dose) and given by a
product λ = σF of particle ﬂuence F and nuclear cross
section σ.

Aggregation of observed cellular damage potentially
leads to the phenomenon of “overdispersion”– that
is, the variance of the aggregate may be larger than
Poisson variance yielding “relative variance” V arrel =
V ar[SN ]/E[SN ] larger than 1. Assuming thus the Pois-
son statistics of radiative events, for any distribution of
lesions per particle traversal, the condition for overdis-
persion can be easily rephrased in terms of (2.6)

V ar[Xi]/E[Xi] + E[Xi] < 1

(2.13)

If no repair process is involved in diminishing number of
initially produced lesions, the surviving fraction of cells
can be estimated from formula eq.(2.12) as a zero class of
the initial distribution, i.e. the proportion of cells with
no breaks

III. DNA FRAGMENTS DISTRIBUTION
GENERATED BY IRRADIATION: STATISTICAL
MODEL.

DNA double stranded molecules in a size range from
a few tenths of kilobase pairs to several megabase pairs
can be evaluated by the PFGE technique. Randomly dis-
tributed DSBs are detected as smears of DNA fragments.
The DNA mobility mass distribution may be transformed
into a fragment length distribution using a calibration
curve.
It is obtained by relating migration distance of
DNA within the gel to molecular length with the aid of
size markers loaded on the same gel [25]. To interpret
the experimental material one needs to relate percentage
of fragments in deﬁned size ranges to number of induced
DSBs. For that purpose several models have been de-
rived, mainly based on the description of random depo-
larization of polymers of ﬁnite size [9,10,26]. Although
the models give satisfactory prediction of size-frequency
distribution of fragments after sparsely ionizing radiation
(i.e for X-rays and γ), they generally fail to describe the
data after densely ionizing radiation [13,25]. The exper-
iments with heavy ions demonstrate that after exposure
to densely ionizing particles gives rise to substantially
overdispersed distribution of DNA fragments which indi-
cates the occurrence of clusters of damage. The following
analysis presents a model which takes into account forma-
tion of aggregates of lesions after heavy ion irradiation.
Fragment distribution in PFGE studies is measured by

use of ﬂuorescence technique or radioactive labeling with
the result being the intensity distribution. The generated
signal is proportional to the relative intensity distribution
of DNA fragments and can be expressed as

I(x) = xD(x)

(3.1)

with

D(x) =

D(x|j)P (j; µ, λ)

(3.2)

∞

Xj=0

where D(x|j) stands for the density of fragments of
length x provided j DSBs occur on the chromosome of
size S. Frequency distribution of the number of DSBs is
assumed here in the form of CPD (2.9) with parameters µ
and λ representing average number of breaks produced by
a single particle traversal and average number of particle
traversals, respectively. The “broken-stick” distribution
[27,26] for j breaks on a chromosome of size S yields a
density of fragments of size x:

where the ﬁrst two terms describe contributions from the
edge fragments of the chromosome and the third term de-
scribes contribution from the internal fragments of length
x < S. The ﬁrst term applies to the situation when
j = 0; the edge contribution can be understood by ob-
serving that the ﬁrst and the j + 1 fragment have the
same probability of being size x. Direct summation in
formula (3.2) leads to

case, simpliﬁed expression (3.4) leads to results known
in literature as “Bl¨ocher formalism” [9,10,26] which de-
scribes well the DNA content in probes irradiated with

the cell line for which experimental data are displayed in
Figure 4.
The increase in multiplicity of DSBs produced per one
traversal of a particle leads to pronounced increase in
production of shorter fragments which is illustrated in
the shift of the peak intensity towards smaller x values.

IV. SPATIAL CLUSTERING OF BREAKS AND
NON-POISSON STATISTICS.

Clustering of breakage events can be viewed as the pro-
cess leading to non-exponential “spacing” between sub-
sequent events, similar to the standard analysis of level
repulsion in spectra of polyatomic molecules and com-
plex nuclei. For a random sequence, the probability that
a DSB will be in the inﬁnitesimal interval

(X + x, X + x + dx)

(4.1)

proportional to dx is independent of whether or not there
is a break at X. This result can be easily changed by
using the concept of breaks “repulsion’. Given a break
at X, let P (x)dx be the probability that the next break
(x ≥ 0) be found in the interval (X + x, X + x + dx). We
then have for the nearest-neighbour spacing distribution
of breaks the following formula:

P (x)dx = P rob(1 ∈ dx|0 ∈ x)P rob(0 ∈ x)

(4.2)

where P rob(n ∈ dx|m ∈ x) is the conditional probability
that the inﬁnitesimal interval of length dx contains n
breaks wheras that of length x contains m of those. The
ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the above equation
is dx times a function of x which we denote by r(x),
depending explicitly on the choices 1 and 0 of the discrete
variables n and m. The second term is given by the
probability that the spacing is larger than x:

∞

Z
x

P (y)dy

(4.3)

Accordingly, one obtains

P (x) = r(x)

P (y)dy,

(4.4)

whose solution can be easily found to be

P (x) = Cr(x) exp(−

r(y)dy)

(4.5)

where C is a constant. The Poisson law, which reﬂects
lack of correlation between breaks, follows if one takes
r(x) = λ, where λ−1 is the mean spacing between DSBs.
If choosing on the other hand

r(x) = λxλ−1

(4.6)

i.e. by assuming clustering of points (DSBs) along a line,
one ends up with the Weibull density. The constants C
and λ can then be determined from appropriate condi-
tions, e.g.

for the Poisson distribution and

(4.8)

(4.9)

P (x) = λxλ−1 exp(−xλ)

(4.10)

for the Weibull analogue. Note that the above density
can be derived as a generalization of the law eq.(4.9):
the Weibull density can be obtained as the density of
random variable y = x1/λ with x being an exponential
random variable. For λ ≥ 1, the Weibull distribution is
unimodal with a maximum at point xm = (1 − λ−1)λ
.
In this one easily recognizes for λ = 2 the spacing dis-
tribution of the Wigner law. The latter displays “re-
pulsion” of spacing, since P (0) = 0, in contrast to the
Poisson case which gives maximum at x = 0. Fractional
exponent λ < 1 describes, on the other hand, enhanced
frequency of short spacings which, in fact, matches bet-
ter experimental data for heavy ions(cf. Figure 4). The
above analysis brings also similarities with random walks
[29,30] where symmetry breaking transition manifests it-
self as a change in the spectral spacing statistics of decay
rates. In such cases, the statistics of events of interest de-
viates, as a counting process, from the regularity of Pois-
son process, for which the subsequent event arrivals are
spaced with a constant mean λ−1. The clustered statis-
tics of breakage can be thus viewed as a (fractal) random
walk or a cumulative distribution of a random sum of
random variables eq.(2.1). The problem of characteriz-
ing the limit distribution for such cases with underlying
“broad” distributions g(x) of Xi has been studied ex-
tensively in mathematical literature [32] and has been
solved with classiﬁcation of the possible limit distribu-
tions provided that requirement of “stability” is fulﬁlled
under convolution. Following the deﬁnition, the distri-
bution g(x) is stable, if for any N there exist constants
cN > 0 and dN such that SN has the same density as the
variable y = cN Xi + dN . The stability condition can be
rephrased in terms of the canonical representation given
by a form of the characteristic function (i.e. the Fourier
transform g(k)) of stable distributions [33,32]

ln g(k) = iγk − C|k|λ[1 − iωβsign(k)]

(4.11)

where γ is real, 0 ≤ λ ≤ 2, ω is real and |ω| ≤ tan(πλ/2)|.
The cases relevant for biological modelling are covered
by 1 ≤ λ ≤ 2 (stable distributions have no variance if
λ < 2 and no mean if λ < 1).
In particular, positiv-
ity of steps in the random walk modelled by eq.(2.1) al-
lows for g(k) = exp[−C|k|λ] which gives asymptotically
g(x) ≈ x−λ−1. Probability distribution that x ≥ z sat-
isﬁes then f (z) ≈ z−λ for z → ∞. The resulting distri-
bution is “self-similar” in the sense that rescaling z to
Az and f (z) to A−λf (z) does not change the power law

distribution. In other words, the number of realizations
larger than Az is A−λ times the number of realizations
larger than z. The power-law probability distribution
function describes then the same proportion of shorter
and larger fragments whatever size is discussed within
the power law range. For λ = 1/2, C = 1, ω = 1 the form
of L`evy-Smirnov law is recovered

The probability density eq.(4.12) has a simple interpre-
tation as the limiting law of return times to the origin for
a one-dimensional symmetrical random walk and as such
has been also used to describe the fragment size distribu-
tion of a one dimensional polymer [31,34]. In the prob-
lems related to polymer fragmentation induced by irradi-
ation, the approach based on a random walk with ﬂuctu-
ating number of steps (or, equivalently, on a point proce-
ses model with a clustered statistics of waiting times) is
a legitimate one as it can comprise the natural random-
ness of primary events (i.e. particle hits of biological
target) and secondary induction of multiple (clustered)
lesions. Further investigations in this ﬁeld should lead to
better understanding of possible emergence of power-law
distributions of larger fragments on kbp and Mbp scales.

V. CONCLUSIONS

An existing substantial evidence demonstrates that ex-
posure to densely ionizing charged particles gives rise to
overdispersed distribution of chromatin breaks and DNA
fragments which is indicative of clustered damage occur-
ing in irradiated cells. The clustering process can be
expressed for any particular class of events such as ion-
izations or radical species formation and is a consequence
of energy localization in the radiation track. Chromoso-
mal aberrations expressed in irradiated cells are formed
in process of misrejoining of fragments which result from
production of double-strand breaks in DNA. The loca-
tion of double-strand breaks along chromosomes deter-
mines DNA fragment-size distribution which can be ob-
served experimentally. The task of stochastic modeling
is then to relate parameters of such distributions to rele-
vant quantities describing number of induced DSBs. Ap-
plication of the formalism of clustered breakage oﬀers
thus a tool in evaluation of the radiation respone of DNA
fragment-size distribution and assessment of radiation in-
duced biological damage.

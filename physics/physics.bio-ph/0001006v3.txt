Sampling considerations limit the experimental conditions under which information theoretic
analyses of neurophysiological data yield reliable results. We develop a procedure for computing the
full temporal entropy and information of ensembles of neural spike trains, which performs reliably
for limited samples of data. This approach also yields insight upon the role of correlations between
spikes in temporal coding mechanisms. The method, when applied to recordings from complex cells
of the monkey primary visual cortex, results in lower RMS error information estimates in comparison
to a ‘brute force’ approach. PACS numbers: 87.19.Nn,87.19.La,89.70.+c,07.05.Kf

Cells in the central nervous system communicate by
means of stereotypical electrical pulses called action po-
tentials, or spikes [1]. The Shannon information content
of neural spike trains is fully described by the sequence of
times of spike emission. In principle, the pattern of spike
times provides a large capacity for conveying information
beyond that due to the code commonly assumed by phys-
iologists, the number of spikes ﬁred [2]. Reliable quantiﬁ-
cation of this spike timing information is made diﬃcult
by undersampling problems that scale with the number
of possible spike patterns, and thus up to exponentially
with the precision of spike observation (see Fig. 1). While
advances have been made in experimental preparations
where extensive sampling may be undertaken [3–6], our
understanding of the temporal information properties of
nerve cells from less accessible preparations such as the
mammalian cerebral cortex is limited.

Any direct estimate of the complete spike train in-
formation is limited by sampling considerations to rel-
atively small wordlengths, and therefore to the analysis
of short time windows of data. However, it is possible to
take advantage of this restriction itself to obtain estima-
tors which have better sampling properties than a ‘brute
force’ approach. In this Letter we present an approach
based upon a Taylor series expansion of the entropy, to
second order in the time window of observation [7]. The
analytical expression so derived allows the ensemble spike
train entropy to be computed from limited data samples,
and relates the entropy and information to the instanta-
neous probability of spike occurrence and the temporal
correlations between spikes. Comparison with other pro-
cedures such as the ‘brute force’ approach [4,9] indicates
that our analytical expression gives substantially better
performance for data sizes of the order typically obtained
from mammalian neurophysiology experiments, as well as
providing insight into potential coding mechanisms.

Consider a time period of duration T , associated with
a dynamic or static sensory stimulus, during which the
activity of C cells is observed. The neuronal population
response to the stimulus is described by the collection
of spike arrival times {ta
i }, ta
i being the time of the i-th
spike emitted by the a-th neuron. The spike time is ob-

served with ﬁnite precision ∆t, and this bin width is used
to digitise the spike train (Fig. 1). For a given discretisa-
tion (temporal precision), the entropy of the spike train
is a well deﬁned quantity. The total entropy of the spike
train ensemble is

H({ta

i }) = −

P ({ta

i }) log2 P ({ta

i }),

(1)

X{ta
i }

where the summation is over all possible spike times
within T and over all possible total spike counts from
the population of cells. This entropy quantiﬁes the to-
tal variability of the spike train. Each diﬀerent stimu-
lus history (time course of characteristics within T ) is
denoted as s. The noise entropy, which quantiﬁes the
variability to repeated presentations of the same stimu-
lus, is H noise = hH({ta
i }|s)is, where the angular brack-
ets indicate the average over diﬀerent stimuli, hA(s)is ≡
s∈S P (s)A(s). The mutual information that the re-
sponses convey about which stimulus history invoked the
P
spike train is the diﬀerence between these two quantities.

FIG. 1. Digitising spike trains into binary ‘words’ with a
given precision. A common experimental structure has N re-
peats for each separate stimulus (one stimulus shown). The
spike emission times for each such ‘trial’ are binned with reso-
lution ∆t, as shown for the last raster. There are 2L possible
words when examining data from a time window of duration
T .

These entropies may be expanded as a Taylor series in

the time window of measurement,

H = T Ht +

Htt + O(T 3).

(2)

To compute the Taylor expansion, we made the following assumptions: (i) The time window is short enough, or
the ﬁring rate low enough, that there are few spikes per stimulus presentation. (ii) The entropy is analytic in T .
(iii) Diﬀerent trials are random realisations of the same process. We will use the bar notation for the average over
trials at ﬁxed stimulus, such that if ra(t; s) =
i (s), the time-dependent instantaneous ﬁring rate ra(t; s) is its
average over experimental trials. (iv) Spikes are not locked to each other with inﬁnite precision; in other words, the
conditional probability of a spike occuring at time τ b
i } scales for
small ∆t proportionally to ∆t plus higher order terms, with no O(1) terms: P (τ b
i }; s) ∝ ∆t + · · · for each possible
spike pattern {ta

j given occurrence of a particular spike pattern {ta

i }. The validity of these assumptions has been examined elsewhere [10].

j |{ta

i δt,ta

The probability of observing a pattern with k spikes can be expressed as a product of k probabilities of each of the
spikes given the presence of others. Thus from (iv), the probability of this pattern is proportional to ∆tk, and the
expansion is essentially in the total number of spikes emitted. This also implies that only the conditional probabilities
between spike pairs are necessary for the 2nd order expansion. Parameterising the conditional probability between
two spikes by the scaled correlation γab(ta

j; s) [11], we can now write down the probabilities required by Eq. 1.

The diﬀerence between the total and noise entropies gives
the expression for the mutual information detailed in [10].

It has recently been found that correlations, even if
independent of the stimulus identity, can increase the in-
formation present in a neural population [8,12]. This ap-
plies both to cross-correlations between the spike trains
from diﬀerent neurons and to auto-correlations in the
spike train from a single neuron [10]. The equations de-
rived above add something to the explanation of this phe-

nomenon provided in [8]. Observe that the second order
total entropy can be rewritten in a form which shows that
it depends only upon the grand mean ﬁring rates across
stimuli, and upon the correlation coeﬃcient of the whole
spike train, Γ(ta
j) (deﬁned across all trials rather than
those with a given stimulus as for γ(ta

j; s)). Thus,

It follows that the second order entropy is maximal when
Γ = 0, and non-zero overall correlations in the spike
trains (indicating statistical dependence) always decrease
the total response entropy. γ(s) acts on the noise entropy
as Γ does upon the total entropy – it can only decrease
the conditional entropy. The eﬀect of γ(s) on the total
entropy is more complex, depending upon the correlation
of the ﬁring across stimuli. γ(s) can be chosen so as to in-
crease the total entropy (and thus the information, with
the noise entropy ﬁxed), and this increase will be maxi-
mal for the γ(s) which lead exactly to Γ = 0. Neuronal or
spike time interaction may therefore eliminate or reduce
the eﬀect of statistical dependencies introduced by other
covariations.

The rate and correlation functions in practice must be
estimated from a limited number of experimental trials,
which leads to a bias in each of the entropy components.
This bias was corrected for, as described in [13]; how-
ever, the sampling advantage that will be described was
observed both with this correction, without bias correc-
tion, and with other bias correction approaches such as
that used in [6].

sual cortex (V1) of anaesthetised macaque monkeys [15].
Fig. 2 examines, for a typical V1 complex cell, the de-
pendence of the accuracy of the noise entropy estimate
upon the number of experimental trials utilised. It is the
noise entropy which is most aﬀected by sampling con-
straints, so we shall concentrate upon this quantity here.
The top panel shows the estimates before application
of a bias removal procedure, using the series (our tech-
nique) and ‘brute force’ (simple application of Eqn. 1)
approaches. The entropies are expressed as a fraction
of the asymptotic entropy obtained by polynomial ex-
trapolation [6]. Reliable extrapolation to the asymptotic
entropy was possible because of the large amount of data
that happened to be available for this cell (which was
chosen with that in mind; more usually between 20 and
100 trials were available). This allowed us to compare
the performance of the methods on smaller subsets of
the data against a known reference. The fact that series
and brute-force estimators converged for this cell indi-
cates that higher order correlations amongst spike times
contributed little to the entropy.

The better performance of the series approach can be
understood by considering that (at second order) it re-
quires sampling from only the ﬁrst two moments of the
probability distribution, whereas the ‘brute force’ ap-
proach depends upon all moments. Higher moments have
to be computed from events with lower and lower prob-
ability, as shown in Eqn. 4; estimation of these lower
probability events is more error-prone, and leads to the
larger bias of the ‘brute force’ approach.

Also shown in Fig. 2 is the Ma lower bound upon the
entropy [14], which has been proposed as a useful bound
which is relatively insensitive to sampling problems [6].
The Ma bound is tight only when the probability distri-
bution of words at ﬁxed spike count is close to uniform.
It can be seen that for the V1 complex cell data, the Ma
bound is not tight at all. To understand the behaviour
of the Ma bound for short time windows, we calculated
series terms. The Ma entropy already diﬀers from the
true entropy at ﬁrst order:

The upper panel, (i), shows entropy estimates prior to correc-

The dotted line indicates the ‘brute force’ sampling charac-

sions of these estimates, and in addition the Ma lower bound
upon the entropy. The asymptotic entropy was obtained by
extrapolating from the curves; the results agree to within 1%.
Error bars were obtained by bootstrap resampling.

To demonstrate its applicability, we applied the series
entropy analysis to data recorded from the primary vi-

This coincides with Eqn. 5 only if there are no varia-
tions of rate across time and cells. If there were higher
frequency rate variations, or more cells with diﬀerent re-
sponse proﬁles, the Ma bound would be still less useful.
Estimation quality depends upon not just sampling
bias, but also variance; these can be summarised by the
RMS error of the entropy estimate. We investigated the
behaviour of the RMS error by ﬁtting a Poisson model
with matched time-dependent ﬁring rate to the experi-
mental data of Fig. 1. This model, although yielding a
5% lower noise entropy (because of correlations in the

real data), predicted the ‘brute force’ sampling charac-
teristics of Fig. 2 almost exactly. The model was used
to generate a larger set of data (10,000 trials, or 160,000
stimulus presentations in total). This model yields worst-
case sampling for the ‘brute force’ estimator; worst-case
sampling for the series estimator would be achieved by
even spread of probability throughout only the second
order response space. The simulation serves to compare
the estimators in a statistical regime similar to that of
the typical cell of Fig. 2.

FIG. 3. RMS error scaling characteristics for wordlengths
from 4 to 12 in the simulation. The true noise entropies were
2.0, 3.5 and 4.7 bits respectively.

Fig. 3 shows the scaling of the RMS error before bias
correction with data-size in this simulation. Scaling is
qualitatively similar (but with a sharper decrease) af-
ter correction. The scaling behaviour resulting from the
simulation predicts that with a ‘brute force’ approach, a
RMS error of 2% of the entropy at a wordlength of 12
would require around 1400 trials with, and greater than
5000 trials without, application of the ﬁnite sampling cor-
rection. The series estimator reduces these requirements
to approximately 50 and 400 trials respectively. These
ﬁgures are dependent upon data statistics, and should
be checked on a case by case basis; however, the dimen-
sionality reduction with the series expansion provides a
general improvement in the quality of entropy estimates
for short time windows.

Some readers may wonder whether this new method
amounts to computing the entropy with words with
greater than 2 spikes thrown out. This is not the
case: the proposed method considers pairwise interac-
tions amongst all spikes in the word, no matter how many
It thus (unlike a truncated brute force ap-
there are.

proach) obtains the ability to take into account almost
all of the entropy of longer words, while retaining the
sampling beneﬁts of being a second order method.

As neuroscience enters a quantitative phase, informa-
tion theoretic techniques are being found useful for the
analysis of data from physiological experiments. The
methods developed here may broaden the scope of the
study of neuronal information properties. In particular,
they render feasible the information theoretic analysis
of some recordings from anaesthetised and awake mam-
malian cerebral cortices.

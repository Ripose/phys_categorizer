Abstract

The α predominant electroencephalographic (EEG) recording of the human brain during eyes

open and closed is studied using the zero-crossing time statistics. A model is presented to demon-

strate and compare the key characteristics of the brain state. We found the zero-crossing time

statistic is more accurate than the power spectral analysis and the detrend ﬂuctuation analysis.

Our results indicate diﬀerent EEG fractal scaling in eyes closed and open for individuals capable

of strong α rhythm.

Recent studies showed that the electroencephalographic (EEG) measurement of the cor-
tical layer activity of the human brain exhibits power law characteristic1,2,3. This implies the

complex brain dynamics is fractal or scale-free. In biological systems, band-limited feature

often coexists in the power law environment. For example, respiration can synchronize with

the cardiovascular dynamics and create the narrow-band feature in the 1/f -like power law
spectrum of the heart rate4. The similar situation in brain dynamics is the appearance of α

rhythm that creates the narrow-band feature in the 8∼12 Hz band of the EEG power law
spectrum1,2,3. Because of its implication in the cognitive process and brain functioning5, a

better characterization of the fractal dynamics in α predominant brain state is important.

For low α intensity, the power law background of the EEG is still discernable. However, for

strong α intensity, a situation that is capable of by a trained meditator or a Yoga master,

the power law background is no longer evident. Fig. 1 shows the EEG from healthy subjects

showing moderate and strong α rhythm. It is seen that the EEG power law background be-
comes ambiguous with increasing α intensity. In addition, the detrend ﬂuctuation analysis6

generates only spurious scaling (see below). In this work, we propose to use the zero-crossing

time of the EEG to study the background fractal scaling in the α predominant brain state.

Our idea is based on the observation of intermittent bursts of α period from the EEG record.

It implies the possible fractal background in α predominant brain state may be revealed by

“subtracting” the α component.

Let EEG be x(t). The zero-crossing time is the level set: {ti, x(ti) = 0} where the index

i registers the order of the zero crossing event. The successive crossing-time-interval (CTI)

is obtained by τi = ti+1 − ti. Let C = {τi}. We deﬁne the subset of successive zero-crossing

A = {τk; τk ∈ IA} ⊂ C where IA is a real interval. If IA spans a small range, A captures the

zero-crossing of the narrow-band dynamics. For example, IA = [1/12, 1/8] × 0.5 (SEC) for

the α frequency band. Note, the factor 0.5 is necessary since the wave form crosses x(t) = 0

twice per cycle. The observed intermittent α periods in EEG implies A consists of disjoint

subsets A = A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · where Ai = {τi1, τi2, · · ·} and im+1 = im + 1.

The CTI for the fractal process is known to follow a power law distribution7: p(τ ) ∼ τ ν,

where p(τ ) is the probability density function. For example, ν = h − 2 for fractional

Brownian motion Bh(t) where h is the Hurst exponent. Intuitively, if A can be related to

the α component of the EEG, the set diﬀerence C\A should contain the fractal crossing that

can be characterized by its power law distribution. However, there are diﬃculties to apply

this idea directly in practice. First, the zero-crossing time ti, i = 1, · · · , is only determined

2

approximately (by linear interpolation). Hence, A is not exact. Second, there is evidence of
power law scaling in the amplitude ﬂuctuation of the α band-passed EEG8. This wide-band

feature suggests the CTI of the α component can span a considerable range outside the 8∼12

Hz band. Thus, to deﬁne A for the α component, the interval IA should cover a much larger

range. The set C\A so deﬁned will capture only those zero-crossings in the neighborhood of

very large or small τ . These zero-crossing events are likely located in the fractal period of

the signal.

To test the above idea, we generated synthetic fractional Brownian motion Bh(t) of
h = 0.3 and 0.8. Based on the reported scaling in α band-passed EEG8, we focused on the

amplitude process Ah(t) deﬁned by the absolute value of the Hilbert transformed Bh(t). Note

that Ah(t) inherits the same scaling characteristics from Bh(t). Hence, the ν exponents are

−1.7 and −1.2 for h = 0.3 and 0.8, respectively. We let IA = [min(τi) × 500, max(τi) ×

0.5], τi ∈ C, to deﬁne the successive zero-crossing in A. Both theoretical ν values are

conﬁrmed before and after subtracting the set A (Fig. 2). This should be the case since

Ah(t) is scale free and no band-limited component exists in Ah(t).

We next construct the model for α predominant EEG to test our method. It is necessary

to clarify that this model was designed to capture only the signal feature of the EEG without

making any reference to the physiological process of the α dynamics. Let the synthetic EEG

be y(t). We ﬁrst generate N random numbers mk, k = 1, · · · , N, as the number of samples in

N intervals of y(t). So the size of y(t) is

mk. The construction of the “α component” in

P

y(t) is achieved in two steps. First, a pure “α tone” is built with the central frequency of 10

Hz: xα(t) = sin[2π(10(1 + Nf ))t](1 + Na) where Nf is a Gaussian variable of mean zero and
variance σ2

f and Na is an uniform random variable in [0,0.5]. The “α component” of y(t) is
obtained after multiplying the amplitude process Ah(t): yα(t) = xα(t)(CAh(t) + 1) where

C is a constant. Finally, the value of y(t) in the ith interval (t ∈ [

i
k mk])
P
is determined from an uniformly distributed random variable V in [0,1]: y(t) = yα(t), if

i−1
k mk + 1,

P

V > p, or y(t) = Ah(t) if V ≤ p, where p is a real number. Ah(t) is further re-scaled to the

same data range as yα(t) to minimize artiﬁciality when V ≤ p. To mimic the α predominant

brain state, a small p = 0.15 is used. Remaining parameters used in the construction are

N = 3000, C = 1, σf = 0.2, h = 0.8, and mk, an uniform random variable in [0, 200] when

V > p and in [0, 150] when V ≤ p,

For

comparison, we also calculated the

spectral density function, S(f ) =

where z(t) =
y(t) − ¯y, ¯y being the mean value of y(t), and zl(t) is the linear trend of z(t)
in the data window of length l. For a fractal process6, S(f ) ∼ f β, F (l) ∼ lγ and 2γ = 1 + β.

P

Fig. 3a shows a segment of the synthetic y(t). Figs. 3b and 3c show the S(f ) and F (l)

of y(t), respectively. The S(f ) captures the narrow-band feature due to yα(t) and shows an

ambiguous power law background. The detrend ﬂuctuation F (l) has a “knee” located at the

“α period:” lK ∼ 0.1 (SEC). For l < lK, F (l) is an increasing function of l, capturing mainly

the detrend ﬂuctuation of yα(t). For l ≫ lK, the detrend ﬂuctuation of yα(t) approaches

a constant since its local trend zl(t) ∼ 0. Hence, for l ≫ lK, F (l) is dominated by the

random components in y(t): Nf , Na and Ah(t). A power law property can be ascertained in

this range with the estimated scaling exponent γ ∼ 0.5. It implies the uncorrelated random

components in y(t) result in the ﬂuctuation of the random-walk.

While the fractal in y(t) cannot be clearly revealed from S(f ) and F (l), the crossing-time

statistic accurately captures the scaling property of the fractal process A0.8(t) in y(t). The

CTI of y(t) is shown in Fig. 4a. The densely populated region τi ∼ 0.05 (SEC) is contributed

by yα(t). Fig. 4b shows the p(τ ) of y(t), yα(t), A0.8(t) and the p(τ ) determined from C\A.

It is seen that CTI of yα(t) not only covers its designed frequency range 10(1 + Nf ) but

also follows a power law distribution over a much wider range due to the fractal component

A0.8(t). We let IA = [min(τi) × 50, max(τi) × 0.5], τi ∈ C, to deﬁne A. The p(τ )’s before

and after deleting A are qualitatively diﬀerent (Fig. 4b). After deleting A, the fractal
component A0.8(t) is revealed in the power law p(τ ) ∼ τ ν with the estimated ν very close to

the theoretical value ν ∼ 0.8 − 2 = −1.2. We also found consistent results for other h values,

indicating the robustness of the method (Fig. 4c). This example illustrates (a) the CTI of a

process showing both fractal and band-limited characteristics can be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent

from the CTI consisting of only the fractal component, and (b) the fractal component can

be captured from C\A with properly deﬁned A.

We now apply the crossing time analysis to the EEG from seven healthy subjects in eyes

open (EO) and closed (EC) [gender: 4 males, 3 females; age: 21∼30 (mean 24) year-old].

Surface scalp electrodes were attached according to the 10-20 international system at O1,

O2 with reference to Fz. For EO, subjects were asked to direct their gaze at certain part of

a shielded room to minimize eye movements. For EC, no speciﬁc instruction was given to

4

the subjects other than to relax and have their eyes closed. Data recording lasted for ﬁve

minutes. The EEG signal was ﬁrst band-passed from 0.1 to 70 Hz and then digitized at 250

Hz (ﬁrst four subjects) and 500 Hz (last three subjects).

In order to compare the α intensity of the subjects, we used the ratio of EEG signal

power in the 8∼12 Hz band to the entire frequency range: Rα =

12
8 S(f )df /
R

R

S(f )df . The

Rα of the data lies between low α power range of 0.05 to the well above-normal α power

range of ∼0.7; (Fig. 5). Also, Rα is always higher in EC than in EO. Three of the seven

subjects (subjects 2∼4) were able to show well above-normal α rhythm with Rα > 0.45 in

EC.

The EEG with strongest α intensity has been shown in Fig. 1 and is reproduced in Fig. 3

to compare with the synthetic y(t) generated above. In addition to the similar appearance

between the two, the S(f ) and F (l) of the real EEG are also close to its artiﬁcial counterparts

(Figs 3b, 3c): both EEG and y(t) show ambiguous power law background in S(f ) and the

“knee” in F (l) at l ∼ 0.1 (SEC) with an estimated scaling exponent γ ∼ 0.5.

The CTI distribution of all EEG data exhibits power law p(τ ) ∼ τ ν, suggesting the fractal

dynamics exist in both moderate and α predominant brain states. Qualitative diﬀerence is

seen in p(τ ) before and after deleting the set A (Fig. 6). Of all the subjects, the ν appears

to be smaller in magnitude in EC than EO (Fig. 7). According to ν = h − 2, this implies

EC has a larger “Hurst exponent” than EO. Moreover, the magnitude of ν appears to be

inversely proportional to the α intensity (Fig. 7). This is found in EO versus EC of the entire

group and in subjects 1,5,6,7, which show particularly strong α rhythm. In these cases, the

large |ν| is seen to associate with small Rα. Finally, diﬀerences of |ν| of individuals in EO

and EC also appear to vary proportionally with the α intensity.

In summary, the technique to extract scaling property in EEG showing band-limited

characteristic is proposed and successfully demonstrated. Using this technique, the scaling

in the brain dynamics in α predominant EEG is obtained. Our results suggest that the

diﬀerence in the fractal dynamics is closely related to individual’s capability of strong α

rhythm. Further study is necessary to analyze the statistics from larger popuation with

strong α capability.

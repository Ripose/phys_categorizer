A versatile approach to modeling the conformations and energetics of DNA loops is presented.
The model is based on the classical theory of elasticity, modiﬁed to describe the intrinsic twist
and curvature of DNA, the DNA bending anisotropy, and electrostatic properties. All the model
parameters are considered to be functions of the loop arclength, so that the DNA sequence-speciﬁc
properties can be modeled. The model is applied to the test case study of a DNA loop clamped
by the lac repressor protein. Several topologically diﬀerent conformations are predicted for various
lengths of the loop. The dependence of the predicted conformations on the parameters of the
problem is systematically investigated. Extensions of the presented model and the scope of the
model’s applicability, including multi-scale simulations of protein-DNA complexes and building all-
atom structures on the basis of the model, are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Formation of DNA loops is a common motif of protein-
DNA interactions [1, 2, 3, 4]. A segment of DNA forms
a loop-like structure when either its ends get bound by
the same protein molecule or a multi-protein complex,
or when the segment gets wound around a large multi-
protein aggregate, or when the segment connects two
such aggregates. In bacterial genomes, DNA loops were
shown to play important roles in gene regulation [1, 2]; in
eucaryotic genomes, DNA loops are a common structural
element of the condensed protein-DNA media inside nu-
clei [3, 4]. Understanding of the structure and dynamics
of DNA loops is thus vital for studying the organization
and function of the genomes of living cells.

The amount of experimental data on the DNA phys-
ical properties and protein-DNA interactions both in
vivo and in vitro has grown dramatically in recent
years [5]. With the advent of modern experimental tech-
niques, such as micromanipulation [6, 7, 8] and fast reso-
nance energy transfer [9], researchers were presented with
unique opportunities to probe the properties of individual
macromolecules. X-ray crystallography, NMR, and 3D
electron cryomicroscopy [10] provided numerous struc-
tures of protein-DNA complexes with resolution up to a
few angstroms, including such huge biomolecular aggre-
gates as RNA polymerase [11] and nucleosome [12, 13].
The ever growing volume of data provides theoretical
modeling, which has generally been recognized as a vital
complement of experimental studies, with an opportunity

to revise the existing models, and to build new improved
models of biomolecules and biomolecular interactions.

Several existing DNA models are based on the theory
of elasticity [14, 15, 16, 17]. These models treat DNA
as an elastic rod or ribbon, sometimes carrying an elec-
tric charge. The geometrical, energetic, and dynamical
properties of such ribbon can be studied at ﬁnite tem-
perature using Monte-Carlo or Brownian Dynamics tech-
niques employing a combined elastic/electrostatic energy
functional [16, 17]. Such studies usually involve exten-
sive data generation, for example, numerous Monte Carlo
structural ensembles, and require signiﬁcant investment
of computational resources. Alternatively, one could re-
sort to faster theoretical methods, such as statistical me-
chanical analysis of the elastic energy functional [18, 19]
or normal mode analysis of the dynamical properties of
the elastic rod [20]. A fast approach to studying the
static properties of DNA loops – such as the loop en-
ergy, structure, and topology – consists in solving the
classical equations of elasticity [21, 22], dated back to
Kirchhoﬀ [23] and derived on the basis of the same en-
ergy functional. The equations can be solved with either
ﬁxed boundary conditions for the ends of the loop or un-
der a condition of a constant external force acting on the
ends of the loop [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29].

In order to achieve a realistic description of the physi-
cal properties of DNA, the classical elastic functional [21,
22, 30] has to be modiﬁed: (i) the modeled elastic ribbon
has to be considered intrinsically twisted (and, possibly,
intrinsically bent) in order to mimic the helicity of DNA,
(ii) the ribbon has to carry electrostatic charge, (iii) be
anisotropically ﬂexible, i.e., diﬀerent bending penalties
should be imposed for bending in diﬀerent directions,
(iv) be deformable, e.g., through extension and/or shear,
(v) have diﬀerent ﬂexibility at diﬀerent points, in order
to account for DNA sequence-speciﬁc properties, (vi) be
subject to possible external forces, such as those from
proteins or other DNA loops. The earlier works have pre-

sented many models including several of these properties,
e.g., bending anisotropy and sequence-speciﬁcity [20];
extensibility, intrinsic twist/curvature, and electrostat-
ics [29]; extensibility, shearability, and intrinsic twist [28];
intrinsic curvature and electrostatics [31]; or intrinsic
twist and forces due to self-contact [26, 27].

Yet, to the best of our knowledge, a completely real-
istic treatment, where the theory of elasticity would be
modiﬁed as to include all of the listed DNA properties,
has never been published. While for DNA segments of
large length some of these properties can be disregarded
or averaged out using a proper set of eﬀective parame-
ters, we feel that a proper model of DNA on the scale
of several hundred base pairs – which is a typical size of
DNA loops involved in protein-DNA interactions – must
be detailed, including a proper description of all physical
properties of real DNA.

This work oﬀers a step towards such a generalized elas-
tic DNA model. The Kirchhoﬀ equations of elasticity are
derived in Sec. II below for an intrinsically twisted (and
possibly bent) elastic ribbon with anisotropic bending
properties. The terms corresponding to external forces
and torques are included and can also be used to ac-
count for the electrostatic self-repulsion of the rod, as
described in Sec. V. All the parameters are considered
to be functions of the ribbon arclength s, thus making
the DNA model sequence-speciﬁc. Only the DNA de-
formability is omitted from the derived equations - yet
can be straightforwardly included in the problem, as dis-
cussed in Sec. VI. The numerical algorithm for solving
the modiﬁed Kirchhoﬀ equations, based on the earlier
work [30, 32], is presented (Sec. III B).

The proposed model is used to predict and analyze the
structure of the DNA loops clamped by the lac repressor,
a celebrated E. coli protein, reviewed in Sec. III A. The
system provides a typical biological application for the
developed model and is used to extensively analyze the
eﬀect of bending anisotropy (Sec. IV) and electrostatic
repulsion (Sec. V) in our model and to evaluate the corre-
sponding model parameters. The DNA sequence-speciﬁc
properties in terms of elastic moduli and intrinsic curva-
ture, while included in the derived equations, were not
used in the study of the lac repressor system.

The further developments that would make the model
truly universal and the model’s scope of applicability are
discussed in Sec. VI. Notably, it is shown how the elastic
rod model can be combined with the all-atom model in
multi-scale simulations of protein-DNA complexes or how
all-atom DNA structures can be built on the basis of the
coarse-grained model.

A. Kirchhoﬀ model of an elastic rod

The classical theory of elasticity describes an elastic
rod (ribbon) in terms of its centerline and cross sections
(Fig. 1 a). The centerline forms a three-dimensional curve
~r(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s)) parametrized by the arclength s.
The cross sections are “stacked” along the centerline; a
frame of three unit vectors ~d1(s), ~d2(s), ~d3(s) uniquely
deﬁnes the orientation of the cross section at each point s.
The vectors ~d1 and ~d2 lie in the plane of the cross section
(for example, along the principal axes of inertia of the
~d2 is the normal
cross section), and the vector ~d3 = ~d1 ×
to that plane [77]. If the elastic rod is inextensible then
the tangent to the center line coincides with the normal
~d3:

˙~r(s) = ~d3(s)

(1)

(the dot denotes the derivative with respect to s).

The components of all the three vectors ~di can be
expressed through three Euler angles φ(s), ψ(s), θ(s),
which deﬁne the rotation of the local coordinate frame
(~d1, ~d2, ~d3) relative to the lab coordinate frame. Alter-
natively, one can use four Euler parameters q1(s), q2(s),
q3(s), q4(s), related to the Euler angles as

ψ)/2,
q1 = sin θ/2 sin (φ
q2 = sin θ/2 sin (φ
ψ)/2,
q3 = cos θ/2 sin (φ + ψ)/2,
q4 = cos θ/2 cos (φ + ψ)/2,

II. BASIC THEORY OF ELASTICITY

In this section we describe ﬁrst the classical Kirchhoﬀ
theory of elasticity and then how this theory can be ap-
plied to modeling DNA loops.

(see, e.g., [34]). The computations presented in this pa-
per employ the Euler parameters in order to avoid the
polar singularities inherent in the Euler angles.

Following Kirchhoﬀ’s analogy between the sequence of
cross-sections of the elastic rod and a motion of a rigid
body, the arclength s can be considered as a time-like

variable. Then the spatial angular velocity ~k of rotation
of the local coordinate frame can be introduced:

˙~di=1−3 = ~k

~di ,

~k =

K1, K2, Ω

.

{

(4)

The vector ~k is called the vector of strains [21, 22]. Ge-
ometrically, its components K1(s) and K2(s) are equal
to the principal curvatures of the curve ~r(s), so that the
total curvature equals

K(s) =

K 2

1 (s) + K 2

2 (s) ,

q

and the vectors of principal normal ~n(s) and binormal
~b(s) (Fig. 1 b) are

~n(s) = K2/K ~d1 −
K1/K ~d2 ,
~b(s) = K1/K ~d1 + K2/K ~d2 .

The third component of the vector of strains Ω(s) is the
local twist of the elastic rod around its axis ~d3 [21]. All
three components can be expressed via the Euler param-
eters qi=1−4 [34, p.16]:

If the elastic rod is forced to adopt a shape diﬀer-
ent from that of its natural (relaxed) shape, then elastic
forces ~N (s) and torques ~M (s) develop inside the rod:

~N (s) = N1 ~d1 + N2 ~d2 + N3 ~d3 ,
~M (s) = M1 ~d1 + M2 ~d2 + M3 ~d3 .

The components N1 and N2 compose the shear force

sion, if N3 > 0, or compression, if N3 < 0, at the cross
section at the point s. M1 and M2 are the bending mo-
ments, and M3 is the twisting moment. In equilibrium,
the elastic forces and torques are balanced at every point
s by the body forces ~f (s) and torques ~g(s), acting upon
the rod:

case of DNA, such forces are mainly of electrostatic na-
ture, as will be described below.

The last equation required to build a self-contained
theory of the elastic rod relates the elastic stress to the
distortions of the rod. The classical approach stems from
the Bernoulli-Euler theory of slender rods, which stipu-
lates the elastic torques ~M (s) to be linearly dependent on
the curvatures and twist of the inherently straight rod:

~M (s) = A1K1 ~d1 + A2K2 ~d2 + CΩ~d3 .
(15)
The linear coeﬃcients A1 and A2 are called the bending
rigidities of the elastic rod, and C is called the twisting
rigidity. For a solid rod, the classical theory ﬁnds that
A1 = EI1, A2 = EI2, where E is the Young’s modulus
of the material of the rod, and I1, I2 are the principal
moments of inertia of the rod’s cross-section. The twist-
ing rigidity C is proportional to the shear modulus µ of
the material of the rod; in the simple case of a circular
cross-section, C = 2µI1 = 2µI2.

The equations (1), (3), (13), (14), and (15) form the
basis of the Kirchhoﬀ theory of elastic rods. We simplify
the equations, ﬁrst, by making all the variables dimen-
sionless:

¯s = s/l, ¯x = x/l, ¯y = y/l, ¯z = z/l ,

¯K1 = lK1,

¯K2 = lK2, ¯Ω = lΩ ,

α = A1/C, β = A2/C, γ = C/C
¯Ni=1−3 = Nil2/C,

¯Mi=1−3 = Mil/C ,

where l is the length of the rod. Second, we express
the derivatives ˙qi through K1, K2, Ω, and the Euler pa-
rameters, using equations (8-10) and the constraint (3),
diﬀerentiated with respect to s. Third, we eliminate the
variables N1 and N2 using equations (12) and arrive at
the following system of diﬀerential equations of 13-th or-

The solutions to this system correspond to the equilib-
rium conformations of the elastic rod. The 13 unknown
functions – ~r(s), qi=1−4(s), ~N (s), and ~M (s) [79] – de-
scribe the geometry of the elastic rod and the distribu-
tion of the stress and torques along the rod. The equa-
tions can be solved for various combinations of initial and
boundary conditions. The case considered in this paper
will be the boundary value problem, when the equilib-
rium solutions are sought for the elastic rod with ﬁxed
ends – that is, with known locations ~r(0), ~r(1) of its ends
at s = 0 and s = 1, and known orientation qi=1−4(0),
qi=1−4(1) of the cross section at those ends. Such case
would correspond, for example, to a DNA loop whose
ends are bound to a protein.

In general, the system (20-30) has multiple solutions
for a given set of boundary conditions. The dimension-
less elastic energy of each solution is computed – accord-
ing to the Bernoulli-Euler approximation (15) – as the
quadratic functional of the curvatures and the twist:

The straight elastic rod becomes the zero-energy ground
state for the functional (31). If the interactions of the
elastic rod with external bodies, expressed through the
forces ~f and torques ~g, are not negligible then the energy
functional will include additional terms due to those in-
teractions.

FIG. 2: (a) The elastic rod ﬁtted into an all-atom structure
of DNA. (b) A coordinate frame associated with a DNA base
pair, according to [35].

B. The elastic rod model for DNA

Elastic rod theory is a natural choice for building a
model of DNA – a long linear polymer. The center-
line of the rod follows the axis of the DNA helix and
Watson-Crick base pairs form cross-sections of the DNA
“rod” (Fig. 2 a). A coordinate frame can be associated
with each base pair according to a general convention [35]
(Fig. 2 b). For a known all-atom structure of a DNA loop,
an elastic rod (ribbon) can be ﬁtted into the loop using
those coordinate frames. Conversely, a known elastic rod
model of the DNA loop can be used directly to build an
all-atom structure of the loop (see App. F). Finally, if
the all-atom structure is known only for the base pairs at
the ends of the loop (as in the case of the lac repressor –
cf Sec. III) then the coordinate frames (~d1, ~d2, ~d3) can be
associated with those base pairs and provide boundary
conditions for Eqs. (20-30).

However, several modiﬁcations of the classical theory
are necessary in order to describe certain essential prop-
erties of DNA.

First of all, the relaxed shape of DNA is a helix, which
is described by a tightly wound ribbon rather than a
straight untwisted rod treated by our equations so far.
The helix has an average twist of 10◦/˚A so that one he-
lical turn takes about 36 ˚A. This is much smaller than
the persistent length of DNA bending (500 ˚A) or twisting
(750 ˚A) [36, 37], so even a relatively straight segment of
DNA is highly twisted. We introduce the intrinsic twist
ω◦(s) of the elastic rod as a parameter in our model. It
is considered to be a function of arclength s, because the
twist of real DNA varies between diﬀerent sequences [38].
Second, certain DNA sequences are also known to form
intrinsically curved rather than straight helices [39]. In
terms of our theory that means that the curvature of
the relaxed rod may be diﬀerent from zero in certain
sections of the rod. The intrinsic curvatures κ◦
1,2(s) are
introduced in our model similarly to the intrinsic twist –
as functions of arclength s determined by the sequence
of the DNA piece in consideration.

The intrinsic twist and curvatures result in the modi-

ﬁed Bernoulli-Euler equation (15):

~M (s) = A1κ1 ~d1 + A2κ2 ~d2 + Cω ~d3 ,

(32)

where

κ1,2(s) = Ki(s)

(33)

−

Now,

the elastic torques are proportional to the
changes in the curvatures and twist from their intrin-
sic values, rather than to their total values. Note, how-
ever, that the “geometrical” eqs. (4) – and consequently,
eqs. (24-27) – still contain the full values of the twist and
curvature, so that switching from eq. (15) to eq. (32) does
not simply result in replacing Ki and Ω with κi and ω
throughout the system (20-30).

Another important structural property of real DNA,
is the
i.e., that

which we want to encapsulate in our theory,
sequence-dependence of the DNA ﬂexibility,

certain sequences of DNA are more rigid than oth-
ers [16, 17, 20]. Accordingly, the bending and twisting
rigidities A1, A2, and C in eq. (32) become functions
of arclength s rather than constants. The exact shape
of these functions depends on the sequence of the stud-
ied DNA piece (cf App. D). The dimensionless bending
rigidities α, β, and γ (as well as the dimensionless forces
and torques) now become scaled not by C, but by an
arbitrary chosen value of the twisting modulus C◦ (for
example, the average twisting rigidity of DNA):

α = A1/C◦, β = A2/C◦, γ = C/C◦ ,
¯Mi=1−3 = Mil/C◦
¯Ni=1−3 = Nil2/C◦,

(34)

(35)

(cf eq. (18,19)).

With the above changes, the new ’grand’ system of

diﬀerential equations becomes:

The system (36-46) describes the elastic rod model of
DNA in the most general terms. Not all of the options
provided by such model will be explored in the present
work; most times the equations will be simpliﬁed in one
way or another. The unexplored possibilities and situa-
tions when they might become essential will be discussed
in Sec. VI.

To conclude this section, let us observe two immediate
results of switching from the classical equations (20-30)
to the more realistic equations (36-46). First, the high
intrinsic twist ω◦(s) results in strongly oscillatory be-

havior of solutions to the system (36-46). Due to the
non-linear character of the system, the oscillatory com-
ponent can not be separated from the rest of the solution.
Second, a DNA loop that contains intrinsically bent seg-
ments (those inside which κ◦
= 0) may not be uniformly
1,2 6
twisted – as it would be in the classic case – even if the
loop were isotropically ﬂexible (α = β) and no external
torques were acting upon the loop (~g = 0). Whereas
the classical theory necessitates that in such case ˙Ω = 0
(cf eq. (22)), the right-hand part of the updated eq. (38)
is non-zero if K1,2 6

= κ1,2.

III. ELASTIC ROD SOLUTIONS FOR THE DNA
LOOP CLAMPED BY THE LAC REPRESSOR

In this section we ﬁrst describe the test case system
for our theory: the complex of the lac repressor protein
with DNA. Then this protein-DNA system is used to il-
lustrate the numeric algorithm of solving the equations
of elasticity. Finally, diﬀerent solutions for the DNA loop
clamped by the lac repressor are presented.

A. The DNA complex with the lac repressor

For a test case study, the developed theory was used
to build a model of the DNA loop induced in the E. coli
genome by the lac repressor protein. Lac repressor func-
tions as a switch that shuts down the lactose (lac) operon
– a famous set of E. coli genes, the studies of which
laid one of the cornerstones of modern molecular biol-
ogy [3, 41, 42]. The genes code for proteins that are
responsible for lactose digestion by the bacterium; they
are shut down by the lac repressor when lactose is not
present in the environment. When lactose is present, a
molecule of it binds inside the lac repressor and deacti-
vates the protein, thereby inducing the expression of the
lac operon (Fig. 3 a-b).

The lac repressor consists of

two DNA-binding
“hands”, as it can be seen in the crystal structure of the
protein [40] (Fig. 3 c). Each “hand” recognizes a speciﬁc
21-bp long sequence of DNA, called the operator site.
The lac repressor binds to two operator sequences and
causes the DNA connecting those sequences to fold into
a loop. There are three operator sequences in the E. coli
genome: O1, O2, and O3 [43]; the repressor binds to O1
and either O2 or O3, so that the resulting DNA loop can
have two possible lengths: 385 bp (O1-O2) or 76 bp (O1-
O3) (Fig. 3 b). All three operator sites are necessary for
the maximum repression of the lac operon [43]. While
the long O1-O2 loop (385 bp) is the easier to form, the
short O1-O3 loop (76 bp) contains the lac operon pro-
moter [80] so that folding this 76 bp region into a loop is
certain to disrupt the expression of the lac operon.

It would hardly be possible to crystallize the DNA
loops induced by the lac repressor – merely because of
their size – and thus the crystal structure [40] of the lac
repressor was obtained with only two disjoint operator
DNA segments bound to the protein [81]. The equations
of elasticity, discussed above, can be used to build elas-
tic rod structures of the missing loops, connecting the
two DNA segments. Such structure would allow to fur-
ther the study of the lac repressor-DNA interactions in
several ways. First, the force of the protein-DNA inter-
actions computed after solving the equations of elasticity
can be used in modeling the changes in the structure of
the lac repressor that likely occur under the stress of the
bent DNA loop. Second, the elastic rod structure of the
loop may serve as a scaﬀold on which to build all-atom
structures of its parts of interest – such as the binding

6

sites of other proteins, important for the lac operon ex-
pression, e.g., RNA polymerase and CAP – or, indeed,
of the whole loop (cf App. F). All-atom simulations of
these sites, either alone or with the proteins docked, may
provide interesting keys to the interactions of the regula-
tory proteins with the bent DNA loop and therefore, to
the mechanism of the lac operon repression. Third, one
can predict how changing the DNA sequence in the loop
would inﬂuence the interactions between the lac repres-
sor and the DNA – by changing the sequence-dependent
DNA ﬂexibility in our model and observing the resulting
changes in the structure and energy of the DNA loop.
Finally, the lac repressor system can be used to tune the
elastic model of DNA per se, in terms of parameters and
complexity level, by comparing the predictions resulting
from our model with the experimental data.

These questions will be further discussed in Sec. VI,
while the following sections will detail our study of the
lac repressor system.

B. Solving equations of elasticity for the
76 bp-long promoter loop O1-O3

The crystal structure [40] of the lac repressor-DNA
complex provides the boundary conditions for the equa-
tions of elasticity (36-46). The terminal [82] base pairs
of the protein-bound DNA segments are interpreted as
the cross-sections of the loop at the beginning and at the
end, and orthogonal frames are ﬁtted to those base pairs,
as illustrated in Fig. 2 b. The positions of the centers of
those frames and their orientations relative to the lab co-
ordinate system (LCS) provide 14 boundary conditions:
~r(0), ~r(1), qi=1−4(0), qi=1−4(1) for equations (36-46). In
order to match the 13th order of the system, a boundary
condition for one of the qi’s is dropped; it will be au-
tomatically satisﬁed because the identity (3) is included
into the equations.

The iterative continuation algorithm used for solv-
ing the BVP is the same as that used in our previous
work [32] (with some modiﬁcation when the electrostatic
self-repulsion is included into the equations, as described
in Sec. V). The solution to the problem is constructed in
a series of iteration cycles. The cycles start with a set of
parameters and boundary conditions for which an exact
solution is known rather than the desired ones. Grad-
ually, the parameters and the boundary conditions are
changed towards the desired ones. Usually, only some of
the parameters are being changed during each speciﬁc it-
eration cycle: for example, only ~r(1) or only α/β. During
the cycle, the parameters evolve towards the desired val-
ues in a number of iteration steps; the number of steps is
chosen depending on the sensitivity of the problem to the
modiﬁed parameters. At each step, the solution found on
the previous step is used as an initial guess; with a proper
choice of the iteration step, the two consecutive solutions
are close to each other, which guarantees the convergence
of the numerical BVP solver. For the latter, a classical

to the problem as a set of collocating splines.

The exact solution, from which the iteration cycles
started, was chosen to be a circular closed (~r(0) = ~r(1))
elastic loop with zero intrinsic curvature κ◦
1,2, constant
intrinsic twist ω◦ = 34.6 deg/bp (the average value for
the classical B-form DNA [3]), constant elastic moduli
α = β = 1
2 , and no electrostatic charge (QDNA = 0) [83].
This solution is shown in Fig. 4 a; the explicit form of
the solution is given in App. A. The loop started (and
ended) at the center of the terminal base pair of one of
the protein-bound DNA segments. The coordinate frame
associated with that base pair (or the loop cross-section
at s = 0) was chosen as the LCS. The orientation of the
plane of the loop was determined by a single parameter
ψ◦ – the angle between the plane of the loop and the
x-axis of the LCS.

In the ﬁrst iteration cycle, the value of ~r(1) was
changed, so that the s = 1 end of the loop moved by
45 ˚A to its presumed location at the beginning of the
second DNA segment (Fig. 4 b).

In the second iteration cycle, the cross-section of the
elastic rod at the s = 1 end was rotated so as to satisfy
the boundary conditions for qi=1−4(1) (Fig. 4 c,d). The
rotation consisted in simultaneously turning the normal
~d3 of the cross-section to coincide with the normal to the
terminal base pair and rotating the cross-section around
the normal in order to align the vectors ~d1 and ~d2 with
the axes of the base pair.

Depending on the direction of the rotation, two diﬀer-
ent solutions to the problem arise. Rotating the s = 1
end clockwise results in the solution shown in Fig. 4 c.
Rotating the end counterclockwise results in the solution
shown in Fig. 4 d. The former solution is underwound
1.4 ◦ per bp on the average and the latter solu-
by ω =
tion is overwound by ω = 1.6 ◦ per bp on the average –
hence, they will be hereafter named “U” and “O”. The
two solutions may be transformed into each other dur-

FIG. 6: Distribution of curvature, twist, and energy in the elastic rod BVP solutions (U - left panel, O - right panel) for the
76 bp DNA loop. In each panel, left column: the isotropic solution with α = β = 2/3; center column: the anisotropic solution

ing an additional iteration cycle: namely, a rotation of
the s = 1 end clockwise by 2 π around its normal trans-
forms the U solution into the O solution, and vice versa.
Then, a rotation of the s = 1 end by another turn re-
stores the U solution, so that a continuous rotation of
the s = 1 end results in switching between the two so-
lutions. That happens because of a self-crossing of the
DNA loop, which is not yet prevented in the model at this
point. Topologically, rotating the end increases the link-
ing number [14, 45] of the loop by 2 π and a self-crossing
reduces the linking by the same amount; therefore, two
full turns are exactly compensated by one self-crossing,
and the original solution gets restored after two turns.

In the third iteration cycle, the bending moduli α
and β (so far, equal to each other) were changed from
0.5 to 2/3 – which is the ratio between DNA bending
and twisting moduli that most current experiments agree
upon [84]. Such increase in the bending rigidity slightly
changed the geometry of the U and O solutions (Fig. 4 e-
1.6 ◦/bp
f) and increased the unwinding/overwinding to
and 2.0 ◦/bp, respectively. The change in ω has a clear
topological implication: the deformation of the looped
DNA is distributed between the writhe (bending) of the
centerline and the unwinding/overwinding of the DNA
helix. When the bending becomes energetically more
costly, the centerline of the loop straightens up (on the
average) and the deformation shifts towards more change

−

in twist.

Notably, two more solutions may result from the iter-
ation procedure, depending on the orientation ψ◦ of the
initial simpliﬁed circular loop (Fig. 5). However, for the
76 bp loop these solutions are not acceptable, because the
centerlines of the corresponding DNA loops would have
to run right through the structure of the lac repressor (cf
Fig. 5 c-d and Fig. 3 c).

Therefore, only the two former solutions to the prob-
lem are acceptable in the case of the short loop. The
shapes of the solutions obtained after the third iteration
cycle become our ﬁrst-approximation answer to what the
structure of the DNA loop created by the lac repressor
must be. The solutions are portrayed in Fig. 4 e-f, and
the proﬁles of their curvature, twist, and elastic energy
density are shown in Fig. 6 (left columns of the two pan-
els).

The U solution forms an almost planar loop, its plane
being roughly perpendicular to the protein-bound DNA
segments (Fig. 4 e). The shape of the loop resembles a
semicircle on two relatively straight segments connected
by short curved sections to the lac repressor-bound DNA.
Accordingly, the curvature of the loop is highest in the
middle and at the ends, the strongest bend being around
6 deg/bp, and drops in between (Fig. 6). The average
curvature of this loop is 3.7 deg/bp. The unwinding is
constant, by virtue of α = β – for the same reason the

energy density proﬁle simply follows the curvature plot.
The total energy of the loop is 33.0 kT, of which 26.8 kT
are accounted for by bending, and 6.2 kT by twisting.
The stress of the loop pushes the ends of the protein-
bound DNA segments (and consequently, the lac repres-
sor headgroups) away from each other with a force of
about 10.5 pN (Fig. 4 e).

The O solution leaves and enters the protein-bound
DNA segments in almost straight lines, connected by a
semicircular coil of about the same curvature as that
of the U solution, not, however, conﬁned to any plane
(Fig. 4 f). The average curvature equals 3.6 deg/bp. The
energy of this loop is higher: 38.2 kT, distributed between
bending and twisting as 28.5 kT and 9.7 kT, respectively.
The forces of the loop interaction with the protein-bound
DNA segments equal 9.2 pN and are pulling the ends of
the segments past each other (Fig. 4 f).

Since the energy of the U loop is 5 kT lower than that
of the O loop, one could conclude that this form of the
loop should be dominant under conditions of thermody-
namic equilibrium. Yet, both energies are too high: the
estimate of the energy of the 76 bp loop from the ex-
perimental data [46] is approximately 20 kT at high salt
concentration (see App. B). Therefore, one cannot at
this point draw any conclusion as to which loop struc-
ture prevails, and further improvements to the model are
needed, such as those described in sections IV-V.

C. Solutions for the 385 bp-long O1-O2 loop

Using the same algorithm, the BVP was solved for the
385 bp loop. Similarly, four solutions were obtained (cf
Figs. 4 e-f, 5 c-d). With the longer loop, the previously
inacceptable solutions are running around the lac repres-
sor rather than through it – and therefore, are acceptable.
All four solutions (denoted as U, U′, O, O′) are shown in
Fig. 7. The solutions U and U′ are underwound, O and
O′ are overwound. The geometric and energetic param-
eters of the four solutions are shown in Table I.

It is, of course, not surprising that the elastic energy
and the average curvature and twist of the longer loops
are smaller than those of the shorter loops of the same
topology. The curvature and the twist decrease because
the same amount of topological change (linking number)
has to be distributed over larger length – and the energy

density decreases as the square of the curvature/twist,
so the integral energy is roughly inversely proportional
to the length of the loop. More interestingly, it is the U
loop again that has the lowest energy and, on the ﬁrst
look, should be predominant under thermodynamic equi-
librium conditions. And the formerly extraneous U′ and
O′ solutions clearly have such high energies that they
should practically not be represented in the thermody-
namical ensemble of the loop structures and could be
safely discounted for the 385 bp loop as well.

lutions of the BVP problem for the 385 bp-long DNA loop,

Yet again, the conclusions, based on the obtained en-
ergy values, shall be postponed until the present elastic
rod model is further reﬁned.

IV. EFFECTS OF ANISOTROPIC FLEXIBILITY

As the ﬁrst step towards reﬁning our model, a closer
look is taken into the DNA bending moduli A1 and
A2 (or, α and β). The majority of the earlier treat-
ments [18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 47] used the approx-
imation of isotropic ﬂexibility: α = β, which holds for
an elastic rod with a cross-section that has a rotational
symmetry of the 4-th order. Such approximation sim-
pliﬁes the problem, for example, resulting in a uniform
distribution of the extra twist (unwinding or overwind-
ing) ω along the DNA in the absence of the external
twisting moment g3: ω(s) = const (cf eqs. (22), (38)).
However, the DNA cross-section is rotationally asymmet-
ric (see Fig. 2 b). Therefore the DNA is treated here as
= β. Hav-
an anisotropically ﬂexible rod – one with α
ing started with the isotropic model, we consider in this
Section the eﬀect of anisotropic ﬂexibility on the confor-
mation and energy of the elastic rod.

A. Anisotropic moduli of DNA bending

The bending and twisting moduli (or persistence
lengths) A and C of DNA has been measured in many ex-
periments [7, 36, 48]. Most experiments currently agree
on the ratio A/C = 2/3. However, this value is obtained
by interpreting the experimental data in terms of isotrop-
ically bendable DNA, i.e., idealized DNA with a circu-
lar cross-section. However, the DNA structure clearly
shows that at the atomic level the DNA bending should
be anisotropic:
for example, bending of DNA towards
one of its grooves should clearly take less energy than
bending over its backbone (Fig. 2). Here we model the
anisotropic rigidity by using two bending moduli A1 and
A2 for bending in the direction of the grooves or in the
direction of the backbone, respectively. (Other approxi-
mations are also conceivable [17, 49]).

How can the experimentally estimated eﬀective bend-
ing modulus A be related to the two bending moduli?
To obtain a correct answer one should remember that
the discussed bending takes place in a tightly twisted
rod, i.e., one period of the intrinsic twist of the rod is
much smaller than the typical radius of curvature. In a
rod without such intrinsic twist, the thermal ﬂuctuations
of bending in two principal directions (that is, of bending
around ~d1 and ~d2 – see Fig. 2 b) are independent, and a
well-known formula (see, e.g., [49, 50]) is obtained from
the principle of energy equidistribution:

1
A

=

1
2

1
A1

+

1
A2 (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(48)

However, when the anisotropic rod is tightly twisted,
the thermal ﬂuctuations will inevitably cause bending in
both principal directions. One may consider, for exam-
ple, the bending a long screw: both the groove and the
ridge of its thread will in turn be facing the direction of

11

(49)

the bend. Since unwinding involves energetic penalty as
well, the rod can not unwind so as to face the bend only
with the “soft side”. Accordingly, the eﬀective bending
modulus A will depend on both A1 and A2. In the rod
with no intrinsic curvature, the ﬁrst approximation yields
the following simple relation:

A =

A1 + A2
2

(see App. C).

This single equation is however not suﬃcient to de-
rive both α and β from the A/C ratio as the ratio of
A1/A2 = α/β remains unknown.
In [49], the value of
α/β = 1/4 was suggested as both being close to exper-
imental data and reproducing well the DNA persistence
length in Monte Carlo simulations. Other estimates re-
sult from comparison of the oscillations of roll and tilt
– the angles of DNA bending in the two principal di-
rections [38, 51] – which are directly related to α and
β. Moreover, there is always an uncertainty due to the
dependence of both the α/β and the A/C ratio on the
DNA sequence – and for a speciﬁc short DNA loop, such
as the one studied here, they may diﬀer from the average
values measured for a long DNA with variable sequence.
For these reasons, we decided to study the eﬀect of
bending anisotropy on the structure and energy of the
lac repressor loops in a broad range of parameters µ =
(α + β)/2, and to pick the loops with
α/β and A/C
A/C = 2/3 and µ = 1/4 for a detailed structural and
energetic analysis.

≈

B. Changes to the lac repressor loops due to
bending anisotropy in the case of µ = 1/4

Let us ﬁrst consider the structure of the U and O loops
in the speciﬁc case µ = 1/4, for it will be easier then to
understand the general picture afterwards. To obtain the
new loops, another iteration cycle was performed, dur-
ing which the previously generated isotropic structures
with α = β = 2/3 were transformed by simultaneously
changing the bending moduli α and β towards the desired
values of 4/15 and 16/15, respectively.

The structures of the loops are shown in Fig. 8. As
one can see, the U loop did not change much, the root-
mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) [85] from the isotropic
solution being only 1.1 h. In contrast, the O loop changed
by 4.6 h and bent over itself at the point of near self-
contact even more than the “soft” isotropic loop with
α = β = 1/2 (cf. Fig. 4 f).

The energies of both loops changed signiﬁcantly, get-
ting reduced by about one-third. The energy of the U
loop dropped from 33.0 kT to 23.3 kT, distributed be-
tween the bending and twisting as 18.9 kT and 4.4 kT,
respectively. The energy of the O loop dropped from
38.2 kT to 26.5 kT, distributed between the bending and
twisting as 22.2 kT and 4.3 kT, respectively.

6
To understand the considerable energy change, one
should consider the structure of the loops on the small
scale. The distributions of curvature and twist in the
loops are shown in Fig. 6 (central columns). As one can
see, the previously smooth proﬁles acquired a seesaw pat-
tern. This happens because the elastic rod – now better
called elastic ribbon – twists around the centerline with
a high frequency due to its high intrinsic twist – and
therefore the vectors ~d1 and ~d2 get in turn aligned with
the main bending direction (the principal normal ~n, see
Fig. 1). In DNA terms, the loop is facing the main bend-
ing direction with the grooves and the backbone, in turn
(see Fig. 1).

Then, after a half-period of the intrinsic twist, ~d1 gets
aligned with ~n and all the bending occurs towards the
2 /2.

backbone so that K1 = 0,

Since α < β, the latter orientation results in higher en-
ergetic penalty and unbending moments than the former
one. Therefore, the sections of the rod facing the main
bending direction with ~d1 straighten up and those fac-
ing it with ~d2 become more strongly bent. The resulting
oscillations of the curvature are seen in Fig. 6. The struc-
ture of the rod becomes an intermediate between that of
a smoothly bent loop and of a chain of straight links, the
more so the closer the α/β ratio gets to 0. The sections
where the rod is facing the main bending direction with
~d2 play the role of the “soft joints” where most of the
bending accumulates.

It is this concentration of the curvature in the “soft
joints” that results in the decrease in the elastic energy
of the rod. The energy density oscillates together with
the curvature, reaching maxima at the points of the maxi-
mum bend (Fig. 6). Since the bending becomes cheaper,
some of the rod twist gets redistributed into the bend
and the absolute value of the average twist ω decreased
1.3 ◦/bp and
for both U and O solutions (Fig. 6), to
1.3 ◦/bp, respectively.

also displays oscillations (Fig. 6). When all the bending
occurs towards ~d1, the twist slightly increases, as to wind
the “rigid face” away from the main bending direction.
When the bending occurs towards ~d2, the twist slightly
decreases as to prolong the exposure of the “soft face”
to the main bending. These oscillations of the twist are
however not large, because they inﬂict a certain energetic
penalty as well.

Finally,

the force of the protein-DNA interaction
dropped to 7.9 pN for the U solution and to 7.2 pN for
the O solution. The direction of the force in the U solu-
tion changed insigniﬁcantly; the force in the O solution
rotated “upwards” by about 40 degrees.

C. Changes to the 76 bp lac repressor loops in the
broad range of parameters µ and A/C

From the described speciﬁc case of µ = 1/4 and
A/C = 2/3, we proceeded to studying the elastic rod
conformations in a broad range of parameters A/C and
µ (or, α and β). A/C was varied between 1/20 and 20,
and µ between 10−2 and 102. In principle, such range is
too broad as neither the DNA rigidity A/C signiﬁcantly
deviates from the range of 1, even by alternative esti-
mates [7, 20, 36, 48], nor is µ likely to change from 1 by
two orders of magnitude as the oscillations of DNA roll
and tilt are normally of the same order [38, 51]. The val-
ues of µ > 1 are especially unlikely as the DNA bending
towards the grooves should clearly take less energy than
bending towards the backbone (cf Fig. 2). Yet, the com-
putations using the developped method were inexpensive,
the data could be easily generated, and the broad range
of parameters was studied for the sake of generality of our
results in regard to the behavior of twisted elastic rods.
The parameters were changed in two “sweeping” iter-
ation cycles, which started from the isotropic solutions
with α = β = 2/3 and went all over the studied range.
A/C was changed in the ﬁrst cycle, and µ – in the sec-
ond, nested cycle. α and β were computed accordingly
on each step, and the new solutions were generated. The
results of the computations are presented in Figs. 9, 10
for the U and O solutions, respectively.

Expectedly, the energy U of the elastic rod grows when
the bending rigidity A/C is growing. As the relative
energetic cost of the bending and twisting changes, the
elastic rod changes its shape as to optimally distribute
the deformation between bending and twisting. For ex-
ample, when A/C is growing, the rod becomes less bent
and more twisted on the average, the loop straightens
itself up and the average unwinding/overwinding ω in-
creases (Figs. 9, 10). Conversely, when A/C goes down,
the costly twisting falls to zero and the rod centerline
becomes more signiﬁcantly bent at every point. Yet,
ω
the rod can not straighten itself to a line, nor can

fall below zero – therefore, at some point the structure
of the rod approaches an asymptotic shape, the average
unwinding/overwinding and the r.m.s.d. from the initial

structure become constant, and the energy becomes sim-
ply a linear function of the bending modulus (cf.
the
plots in Figs. 9, 10 for µ = 1). A similar eﬀect has been
observed in the studies of the bending anisotropy of a
M¨obius band [52].

As in the discussed speciﬁc case of µ = 1/4, intro-
ducing the anisotropic ﬂexibility results in a signiﬁcant
drop of the elastic energy, by as much as an order of
magnitude. The bending concentrates in the regions
where the loop faces the main bending direction with
its “soft” side, and the twist develops oscillations. The
average twist normally decreases in its absolute value,
as described for µ = 1/4, except when the A/C rigid-
ity becomes really large. Then it is energetically costly
to increase bending even in the soft spots, and the ab-
solute value of the average twist at ﬁrst increases (see
the ω plot for A/C = 20 in Fig. 9). Yet, the further in-
crease in the bending anisotropy further reduces α (or β,
if µ
) and makes bending in the “soft spots” cheaper
than twisting, so the absolute average twist eventually
turns down after the initial increase. As the twist re-
duces to zero, the structure of the rod eventually reaches
an asymptotic shape, as in the case of the changed bend-
ing rigidity. The changes in structure and energy for
µ < 1 and µ > 1 are nearly symmetric, because in the
latter case the “soft spots” simply move along the loop
centerline by a quarter of a period of the DNA helix –
which is a mere 1/30-th of the total length of the loop.

→ ∞

The cut through the 3D plot for the elastic energy
at U = 20 kT shows that the experimentally estimated
looping energy of 20 kT can be achieved in a wide family
of A/C and µ – or, α and β – parameters. The parameter
families for the U and O solutions are shown as contours
on the µ–A/C plane in Figs. 9, 10. For the standard
value of A/C = 2/3, the experimental energy is achieved
for µ
5). Yet, it is evident that the model
of anisotropically ﬂexible twisted DNA can match the
bending energy data with diﬀerent sets of the bending
moduli – so, more data from diﬀerent experiments are
needed in order to conclusively determine what speciﬁc
moduli should be used.

It should also be noted here that the approximation

the bending of the rod is smooth enough compared to the
intrinsic twist. The increase in the bending anisotropy,
however, increases the curvature in the soft spots and
eventually our assumption breaks down, i.e., the average
(α + β)/2 does not correctly describe the rod rigidity
any more for the strongly anisotropic case. This adds
uncertainty to the choice of bending moduli α and β and
necessitates studying the parameters in the broad range.
Yet, certain conclusions about the lac repressor loops
can be made even without certainty about the values of
α and β. The diﬀerence in the energy between the U
and O loops, shown in Fig. 11, exceeds 1 kT for most
of the studied range of α and β, and in a signiﬁcant
part of the range even goes above 3 kT. Therefore, it can
be safely concluded that, under thermal equilibrium, the
DNA loop formed by the lac repressor should preferably
have the shape of the U solution. Incidentally, the shape
of this loop changes less with the change in α and β
(cf Figs. 9, 10) – and therefore can with more certainty
be used to determine such large-scale parameters of the
loop as, for example, the radius of gyration or an average
protein-DNA distance.

Interestingly, as the rigidity A/C is increased, the O
and U loops converge to the same asymptotic shape (cf
snapshots for A/C = 20, µ = 1 in Figs. 9, 10) – the shape
that has the least possible bending. The only diﬀerence
is in the twist – the total twist of the O solution is 2 π
plus that of the U solution – and in this case the whole
energy diﬀerence of about 7 kT comes from the diﬀerence
in the twisting energy.

Another notable feature of the O solution is a near
self-contact, which occurs when, soon after leaving the
s = 0 end, the loop passes close to its other end and
the attached DNA segment (Figs. 4, 8, 10). The contact
gets closer as the bending anisotropy increases or A/C
decreases (Fig. 10). If electrostatics were taken into ac-
count at this moment, this near self-contact would inﬂict
a strong energetic penalty due to the strong self-repulsion
of the negatively charged DNA. This happens indeed, as
it will be demonstrated in the next section, and the open
shape and the absence of any self-contact becomes an ad-
ditional argument in favor of selecting the U solution as
our prediction of the shape of the real DNA loop formed
by the real lac repressor.

D. Bending anisotropy eﬀects for the 385 bp lac
repressor loops

The described eﬀects of bending anisotropy were sim-
ilarly observed in the case of the 385 bp loops. Bending
concentrated in the “soft joints” and the solutions devel-
oped oscillations of curvature, twist, and energy density.
For µ = 1/4, the solutions became more bent and less
twisted on the average, as the data in Table II show (cf.
Table I). The U solution was the one to undergo the
least change from its isotropic shape, while the solutions
O and O′were those that changed the most.

solutions of the BVP problem for the 385 bp-long DNA loop,

computed with respect to the isotropically ﬂexible structures
with α = β = 2/3.

In the broad range of parameters α and β, the four long
loops showed the same tendencies as the two short loops.
The bending anisotropy allowed for a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in the elastic energies, making the loops eﬀectively
softer (more bendable). The shapes of the loops, after
undergoing some transformation following the change in
the bending anisotropy or in the loop rigidity, eventu-
ally reached asymptotic states. The asymptotic states
for the soft loops (those with the small A/C ratio and/or
high µ) were strongly bent conformations with practically
zero unwinding/overwinding, where the twisting energy
was of the same order as the small bending energy. The
asymptotic states for the rigid loops (those with the large
A/C ratio and µ on the order of 1) were the conforma-
tions with the least possible bending for each given loop
topology, where the twisting achieved the worst possible
value so as to optimized the bending, yet the latter still
accounted for most of the elastic energy. Same as in the
case of the short loops, the shapes of the overwound and
underwound solutions converged when the loop rigidity
achieved particularly large values.

The underwound U solution was again the one to have
the least elastic energy among the four solutions through-
out the whole studied range of α and β (A/C and µ)
values. The maps of the energy diﬀerence between U
and the other three solutions are shown in Fig. 12. The
energy of the O solution does not normally diﬀer from
that of the U solution by more than several kT, there-
fore the O solution should contribute to a small extent to
the thermodynamic ensemble of the loop shapes and the
properties of the lac repressor-bound 385 bp DNA loop.
In contrast, the energies of the U′ and O′ loops are con-
sistently 2-2.5 times larger than the energy of the U loop
– and the diﬀerence amounts to small kT values only for
unlikely combinations of A/C and µ. Therefore, one can
safely conclude that these two loops, even though unin-
hibited by steric overlap with the lac repressor, are still
extraneous solutions, as in the case of the 76 bp loop,
and may be safely excluded from any computation in-
volving the properties of the thermodynamic ensemble
of the 385 bp loop conformations.

V. ELECTROSTATIC EFFECTS

−

The last, but perhaps, the most important extension of
the classic theory that is included in our model, consists
of “charging” the modeled DNA molecule. The phos-
phate groups of a real DNA carry a substantial electric
charge:
20.8e per helical turn, that signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
ences the conformational properties of DNA [53, 54, 55].
The DNA experiences strong self-repulsion that stiﬀens
the helix and increases the distance of separation at the
points of near self-contact. Also, all electrostatically
charged objects in the vicinity of a DNA – such as amino
acids of an attached protein, or lipids of a nearby nuclear
membrane – interact with the DNA charges and inﬂuence
the DNA conformations. Below, we describe our model
of the electrostatic properties of DNA and the eﬀects of
electrostatics on the conformation of the lac repressor
DNA loops.

A. Changes to the equations of elasticity due to
electrostatics

The electrostatic interactions of DNA with itself and
any surrounding charges are introduced in our theory
through the body forces ~f :

˙~f (s) = σ(s) ~E(~r(s)) ,

(50)

where ~E is the electric ﬁeld at the point ~r(s) and σ(s) is
the density of DNA electric charge at the point s. The
present simpliﬁed treatment places the DNA charges on
the centerline, as it was done in other studies [29]. Im-
plications of a more realistic model will be discussed in
Sec. VI.

The charge density σ(s) is modeled by a smooth diﬀer-
entiable function with relatively sharp maxima between
the DNA base pairs, where the phosphate charges should
be located. The chosen (dimensionless) function:

σ(s) =

QDNA sin4 (πNDNAs)

(51)

8
3

is somewhat arbitrary but speciﬁcs are unlikely to sig-
niﬁcantly inﬂuence the results of our computations, as
will be discussed below. NDNA denotes the number of
base pairs in the modeled DNA loop (which is assumed
to be starting and ending with a base pair) and QDNA
denotes the total charge of that DNA loop. That charge
is reduced from its regular value of 2e per base pair due
to Manning counterion condensation around the phos-
phates [53]: QDNA = 2eχNDNA. In this work, we assume
χ = 0.25, which is an observed value for a broad range
of salt concentrations [53].

The electric ﬁeld ~E is composed of the ﬁeld of external
electric charges, not associated with the modeled elastic
rod – whichever are included in the model – and from the
ﬁeld of the modeled DNA itself (Fig. 13). ~E is computed
using the Debye screening formula:

an aqueous solution of mono valent electrolyte of molar
concentration cs at 25 ◦C [53]. The dielectric permittivity
ǫ is that of water: ǫ = 80.

The ﬁrst term in eq. (52) represents the DNA inter-
action with external charges qi, located at the points
~Ri; the sum runs over all those charges. The second
term represents the self-repulsion of the DNA loop, and
that sum runs over all the maxima of the charge den-
sity σ(s), where the DNA phosphates – charges of 2eχ
– are located. This sum approximates the integral over
the charged elastic rod; computing such integral would

of the electric ﬁeld at the point s.

be more consistent with the chosen model. However, this
approximation is rather accurate, as will be shown below,
and is made in order to signiﬁcantly reduce the amount
of computations required to calculate the electric ﬁeld.

More importantly, certain phosphate charges are ex-
cluded from the summation in the second term (hence
the prime sign next to the sum). Those excluded are
the charges that are located closer to the point s than a
certain cutoﬀ distance δs (Fig. 13). The reason for in-
troducing such cutoﬀ is that the DNA elasticity has par-
tially electrostatic origin, so that the energetic penalty
for DNA bending and twisting, approximated by the
elastic functional (31), already includes the contribu-
tion from electrostatic repulsion between the neighbor-
ing DNA charges.
It is debatable what “neighboring”
implies here, i.e., how close should two DNA phosphates
be in order to signiﬁcantly contribute to DNA elasticity.
In this work, the cutoﬀ distance δs is chosen to be equal
to one step of the DNA helix (h=36 ˚A). This, on the one
hand, is the size of the smallest structural unit of DNA,
beyond which it does not make sense at all to use a con-
tinuum model of the double helix – so, at the very least,
the phosphate pairs within such unit should be excluded
from the explicit electrostatic component. On the other
hand, the forces of interaction between the phosphates,
separated by more than that distance from each other,
are already much smaller than the elastic force, as will
be shown below. Thus, even though the chosen cutoﬀ δs

might be too small, the resulting concomitant stiﬀening
of the DNA is negligible. For comparison, calculations
with cutoﬀ values δs = 1.5 h and δs = 2 h were also per-
formed.

Thus, the electric ﬁeld ~E, computed using (52),
is
˙~f
substituted into (50), and the resulting body forces
appear in Eqs. (36), (37), (39) of the “grand” system,
in place of the previously zeroed terms. “Unzeroing”
those terms, however, is not the only change to the equa-
tions. More importantly, these body force terms depend
on the conformation of the entire elastic loop due to
the self-repulsion term in (52). This makes the previ-
ously ordinary diﬀerential equations of elasticity integro-
diﬀerential and therefore, requires a new algorithm for
solving them. The solutions of the integro-diﬀerential
equations minimize the new energy functional:

To solve the integro-diﬀerential equations, the follow-
ing algorithm is employed. As previously, the electro-
static interactions are “turned on” during a separate it-
eration cycle. At each step of the latter, the equations
are solved for the electric ﬁeld ~Ei = wE ~E, where the
“electrostatic weight” wE grows linearly from 0 to 1.

However, each step of this iteration cycle becomes its
own iterative sub-cycle. The electric ﬁeld ~Ei is computed
at the beginning of the sub-cycle and the equations are
solved with this, constant ﬁeld. Then the ﬁeld is re-
computed for the new conformation of the elastic rod, the
equations are solved again for the new ﬁeld, and so on
until convergence of the rod to a permanent conformation
(and, consequently, of the ﬁeld to a permanent value).
The weight wE is kept constant throughout the sub-cycle.
To enforce convergence, the ﬁeld used in each round of
the sub-cycle is weight-averaged with that used in the
previous round:

4/15, β = 16/15, ionic strength of 10 mM and an electrostatics
exclusion radius δs = h.

The averaging weight wa is selected by trial and error
so as to speed up convergence. For the lac repressor
system, the trivial choice of wa = 0.5 turned out to be
satisfactory.

This approach to solving the integro-diﬀerential equa-

tions assumes that the elastic rod conformation changes
smoothly with the growth of the electric ﬁeld. For intri-
cate rod conformations, which might change in a com-
plicated manner with the addition of even small electro-
static forces, this approach may conceivably fail. Yet, it
worked extremely well for the studied case of the DNA
loop clamped by the lac repressor.

The changes to the structure and energy of the 76 bp
DNA loops due to electrostatic interactions were com-
puted for a broad range of ionic strength cs (0, 10, 15,
20, 25, 50, and 100 mM) and three diﬀerent cutoﬀ values
δs (h, 1.5 h, 2 h). The computations were performed with
A/C = 2/3 and the previously selected µ = 1/4 (result-
ing in the elastic moduli of α = 4/15 and β = 16/15).
The external charges included in the model were those as-
sociated with the phosphates of the DNA segments from
the crystal structure [40] (see Fig. 13). The iteration
cycle was divided into 100 sub-cycles, which showed a
remarkable convergence: the length of no sub-cycle ex-
ceeded three iteration rounds.

The changes in the structure and energy of the elas-
tic loops due to electrostatic interactions are presented
in Fig. 14 for the ionic strength of 10 mM and the ex-
clusion radius of h. The structure of the U solution al-
most does not change: the r.m.s.d. between the original
(wE = 0) and the ﬁnal (wE = 1) structures does not ex-
ceed 1 h. Neither do the curvature and twist proﬁles of
this loop signiﬁcantly change (Fig. 6, 3d column). The
energy of the loop changes by the electrostatic contribu-
tion of 6.1 kT, that – because the structure is not chang-
ing – practically does not depend on wE (Fig. 14). This
energy increase is mainly accounted for by the interaction
of the loop termini with each other and the external DNA
segments (Fig. 6). The self-repulsion accounts for 55% of
the electrostatic energy; 45% comes from the interaction
with the external DNA segments. The apparent reason
for the absence of a large change in the geometry of the
U loop lies in the fact that this loop is an open semicircu-
lar structure, which at no point comes into close contact
with itself or the external DNA.

In contrast, the initial structure of the O loop is bent
over so that the beginning of the loop almost touches
the end of the loop and the attached DNA segment
(Fig. 8, 14 d). As a result, the electrostatic interactions
force a signiﬁcant change in the structure and energy
(Fig. 14 b, d, f). The structure opens up, the gap at the
point of the near self-crossing increases, the r.m.s.d. be-
tween the ﬁnal and the original structures reaches 9 h
(Fig. 14 f); the DNA overwinding almost doubles (Fig. 6,
6th column). This allows the electrostatic energy to drop
from 13.2 kT to 8.0 kT, yet the elastic energy grows by
1.7 kT (Fig. 14 b); together, the energy reaches 36.3 kT
so that the gap from the U loop increases from 3.3 kT
to 7.4 kT. As in the case of the U loop, the main con-
tribution to the electrostatic interactions comes from the
loop ends (Fig. 6); the energy distribution between self-
repulsion and the interactions with the external DNA
charges is practically the same.

FIG. 16: The eﬀect of ionic strength on the energy and geometry of the 385 bp DNA loops. Elastic (E), electrostatic (Q), and
total (T) energy (left panel) and r.m.s.d. from the uncharged structures (right panel) are plotted for the U, U′, O, and O′ loops
vs the ionic strength cs for the exclusion radius of 3 h. The missing points on the U′ and O′ plots indicate solutions, missing
due to the non-convergence of the iterative procedure (see text).

U and O loops when the ionic strength changes in the
range of 10 mM – 100 mM (which covers the range of
physiological ionic strengths). The structure and elastic
energy of the U loop again show almost no change, the
total energy of that loop falls from 29.7 kT to 23.5 kT due
to the drop in electrostatic energy. The structure of the
O loop returns to almost what it was before the electro-
statics was computed (within the r.m.s.d. of 2.2 h); the
elastic energy of this loop drops back to 26.6 kT and the
electrostatic energy – to mere 0.5 kT. This results show
that theoretical estimates of the energy of a DNA loop
formation in vivo need to employ as good an estimate of
the ionic strength conditions as possible.

The lac repressor loops were extensively used to ana-
lyze all the assumptions and approximations of our model
and showed that those were satisfactory indeed. The cal-
culations were repeated for the self-repulsion cutoﬀs of
δs = 1.5 h and δs = 2 h. The resulting change in the loop
energy at cs =10 mM equals only ∆ Uh−1.5 h = 0.35 kT
and ∆ Uh−2 h = 0.75 kT for the U loop, and ∆ Uh−1.5 h =
0.35 kT and ∆ Uh−2 h = 0.75 kT for the O loop; all these
values drop to below 0.1 kT when the ionic strength rises
to 100 mM. The diﬀerence is mainly in electrostatic en-
ergy, and the elastic energy is always within 0.1 kT of
that of the structures obtained with δs = h. Accord-
ingly, the r.m.s.d. from the uncharged structure varies
by at most 0.1 h for the diﬀerent cutoﬀs (Fig. 15 e, f).
Therefore, even the “largest” cutoﬀ δs = 2 h is satisfac-
tory for the electrostatic calculations – while at the same
time increasing the speed of computations.

An additional advantage of using larger cutoﬀ is that
the concomitant stiﬀening of the modeled DNA, which
possibly takes place due to too many phosphate pairs in-

cluded in the electrostatic interactions, is reduced. Such
stiﬀening, however, is truly negligible: in all the cases, the
electrostatic force does not exceed 1-2 pN per base pair,
compared to the calculated elastic force in the range of
10-20 pN. Changes in the cutoﬀ results in only insignif-
icant changes of the electrostatic force. Nor does eval-
uating the electric ﬁeld and energy using the sums (52)
and (54) (instead of a more consistent integral over the
loop centerline) result in any signiﬁcant diﬀerence. Test
calculations showed that in all the studied cases the two
ways of evaluating the energy diﬀer by at most 0.02%.

Finally,

it was tested in how far the particular
choice (51) for the charge density of DNA σ(s) inﬂuences
the computation results. The calculations were repeated
for the constant charge density σ′(s) = QDNA (in dimen-
sionless representation). The energies of the loop confor-
mation never changed by more than 10−4 of their values
in the whole range of cs and δs; the r.m.s.d. between the
loop conformations obtained with diﬀerent σ(s) never ex-
ceeded 0.01 h. Therefore, the electrostatic properties of
the elastic rod in the current model can safely be com-
puted with constant electrostatic density, further saving
the computation time.

C. Results for the 385 bp lac repressor loops

The electrostatic computations were similarly per-
formed for the 385 bp loops, in the same range of salt
concentrations and for exclusion radii of 2 h and 3 h. For
the U and O loops, the results were qualitatively the
same as in the case of the short loops. The elastic loops
became more open and straigtened up with respect to

the lac repressor; the energy of the loops increased by 0-
6 kT, depending on the salt concentration (Fig. 16). The
U loop was again the one to change its structure and
energy to the least extent. The results of the computa-
tions using the diﬀerent cutoﬀ radii were practically the
same; approximating the self-repulsion ﬁeld by a discrete
sum (52) gave almost exact results; replacing the charge
density function (51) with the constant function σ′(s)
had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the results.

One diﬀerence from the short loop case consisted,
though, in the more signiﬁcant change of the long loop
structures with respect to the uncharged loops. The
r.m.s.d. s reached 10 h for the U loop and 25 h for the
O loop (Fig. 16, cf Fig. 15 e, f). As previously, the ma-
jor part of the electrostatic eﬀect consisted in repulsion
between the ends of the loop, brought closely together
by the protein, and the protein-attached DNA segments.
This repulsion tended to change the direction of the ends
of the loop, bending them away from each other and the
In the case of the short loops it was
DNA segments.
impossible to notably change the direction without sig-
niﬁcantly stressing the rest of the loop. Yet the long loops
could more easily accomodate opening up at the ends and
therefore changed their structures more signiﬁcantly.

The larger structural change necessitated longer calcu-
lations. For the long loops, the iteration steps typically
consisted of 5-6 iteration sub-cycles, and even of a few
dozen sub-cycles at especially stiﬀ steps.

The U′ and O′ loops showed a similar responce to the
electrostatics at high salt concentration (above 25 mM).
Their electrostatic energy lied in the range 0-5 kT, and
the structural change due to the increased bending of the
loop ends amounted to up to 10 h r.m.s.d. from the un-
charged structure for the U′ solution and up to 15 h – for
the O′ solution (Fig. 16). Yet, low salt and stronger elec-
trostatics rendered the solutions instable. Electrostatic
computations with no salt screening (0 mM) transformed
the U′ solution into the U solution and the O′ solution
– into the O solution. What made the solutions instable
was apparently the ever increasing bending of the ends of
the loops away from each other that, in combination with
the bending anisotropy, also caused high twist oscillations
near the loop ends (as described in Sec. IV B). The com-
bination of twisting and bending caused the loops to ﬂip
up – as one can cause a piece of wire to ﬂip up and down
by twisting its ends between one’s ﬁngers.

For the intermediate salt concentrations (10-20 mM)
the oscillations of the intermediate solutions between the
two possible states resulted in non-convergence of the it-
erative procedure. In this respect, using the larger elec-
trostatic exclusion radius improved convergence. For the
exclusion radius of 2 h, the iterations did not converge
for salt concentrations of 15 and 20 mM; convergence for
the 10 mM salt was achieved but resulted again in ﬂip-
ping up to the stable solutions. For the exclusion radius
of 3 h, the iterations successfully converged to U′ and O′
solutions (albeit somewhat changed due to the electro-
statics) for the 15 and 20 mM salt concentrations and

21

did not converge for 10 mM only.

Such instability of the U′ and O′ loops serves, of course,
as another argument for disregarding them in favor of the
stable U and O solutions.

Upon introducing the electrostatic self-repulsion, an
interesting experiment could be performed. Self-crossing
by the solutions during the iteration cycles – as described
in Sec. III B – was no longer possible. Therefore, one
could explore whether superhelical structures of the loop
could be built by further twisting the ends of the loop.
One extra turn around the cross-section at the s = 1 end
did generate new structures of the U and O loops. Yet,
those structures were so stressed and had such a high
energy (on the order of 50 kT higher than their predeces-
sors) that it was obvious that those structures will not
play any part at all in the real thermodynamic ensemble
ot the lac repressor loops. Any further twisting of the
ends resulted in non-convergence of the iterative proce-
dure. Clearly, this length of a DNA loop is insuﬃcient
to produce a rich spectrum of superhelical structures.

VI. DISCUSSION

Below, we will review the presented modeling method
and its limitations, compare it with the previously re-
ported similar models, discuss the possible applications
and the further developments of the method, and summa-
rize what has been learned about the lac repressor-DNA
complex.

A. Summary of the model

The presented modeling method consists in approxi-
mating DNA loops with electrostatically charged elas-
tic rods and computing their equilibrium conformations
by solving the modiﬁed Kirchhoﬀ equations of elastic-
ity. The solutions to these equations provide zero-
temperature structures of DNA loops – the equilibrium
points, around which the loops ﬂuctuate at a ﬁnite tem-
perature. From these solutions, one can automatically
obtain both global and local structural parameters, such
as the twist and curvature at every point of the loop,
the loop’s radius of gyration, the linking number of the
loop and its distribution between writhe and twist, vari-
ous protein-DNA distances, the distances between DNA
sites of special interest, etc. The solutions readily pro-
vide an estimate of the energy of the DNA loop and the
forces that the protein has to muster in order to conﬁne
the loop termini to the given conformation, the distribu-
tion of the energy between bending and twisting, and the
proﬁles of stress and energy along the DNA loop.

Our method allows to build a family of topologically
diﬀerent loop structures by applying such simple geomet-
rical transformations as twisting and rotating the loop
ends, or varying the initial loop conformation that serves
as the starting point for solving the BVP. By comparing

the energies of the topologically diﬀerent conformations
and assuming the Boltzmann probability to ﬁnd the real
DNA loop in either of them, one can either deduce the
lowest energy structure which the loop should predomi-
nantly adopt – as was mostly the case in the studied lac
repressor-DNA complex – or to compute the loop prop-
erties of interest by taking Boltzmann averages among
several obtained structures of comparable energies.

For DNA loops of a size of several persistence lengths
(150 bp [36, 56]), only a few topologically diﬀerent struc-
tures of comparable energy can exist and our simpliﬁed
search of the conformational space should be suﬃcient
to discover all members of the topological ensemble – as
it has been demonstrated in this work. Yet longer DNA
loops should produce large topological families of struc-
tures and, unless a fast exhaustive search procedure is
discovered, this limits the applicability of our method to
DNA loop on the order of or shorter than 1,000 bp. The
method is still good for generating sample structures of
longer loops, but more structures of comparable energy
are likely to be missed.

The lower boundary of applicability of our method is
stipulated by the loop diameter: the Kirchhoﬀ theory
is applicable only if the elastic rod is much longer than
its diameter. The diameter of the DNA double helix is
2 nm, which is equivalent to 6 bp. Therefore, the loop
studied by our method should be at least several times
longer than that: roughly, 50 bp and longer.
Ideally,
one would request that the loop exceed the persistence
length of DNA, yet proteins are known to bend DNA on
smaller scales – as, for example, the lac repressor does –
so we apply the theory to DNA loops of around 100 bp
in length.

Hence, we suggest that the presented model can be
applied to studying the conformations of DNA loops of
about 100 bp to 1,000 bp length. Building a single con-
formation is a fast process that takes only several hours
of computation on a single workstation. The problem
can be solved for a certain set of boundary conditions, as
presented here – or the loop boundaries can be systemat-
ically moved and rotated and the dependence of the loop
properties on the boundary conditions can be studied by
re-solving the problem in each new case. Such approach
has the advantage over the Monte Carlo simulations in
avoiding having to build and analyze a massive set of
structures sampling the conformational space.

At a ﬁnite temperature, the DNA loops exist as an en-
semble of conformations. While generating all feasible
topologically diﬀerent structures, our method still ne-
glects the thermal vibrations of each of them and the
related entropic eﬀects. Yet, those eﬀects are likely to be
insigniﬁcant, since the length of the studied DNA loops is
limited to several persistence lengths, as discussed above.
The related thermal oscillations of the loop structure
should be small, although a separate study to quantify
the eﬀect of the oscillations seems worthwhile. For longer
DNA loops, an extensive sampling of the conformational
space – for example, using the Monte Carlo approach –

is indispensable.

22

B. Advanced features and potential applications

Compared to the pre-existing analytical and com-
putational DNA models based on the theory of elas-
ticity [18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 47], our
model provides a universal and ﬂexible description of
DNA properties and interactions. Most previous meth-
ods either considered the DNA to be isotropically ﬂexi-
ble [18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 47], or did not consider the
eﬀects of the DNA intrinsic twist and curvature [25], or
limited the treatment to a purely elastic model, that is, to
the cases when the electrostatic properties of DNA could
be disregarded [19, 20, 47]. In the present work, a model
of anisotropically ﬂexible, electrostatically charged DNA
with intrinsic twist and intrinsic curvature has been em-
ployed, Kirchhoﬀ equations were derived in their most
general form (36-46), and all these DNA properties have
been extensively studied in the case of the lac repressor
loops. As it has been shown in Sec. IV, the combination
of the intrinsic twist with the anisotropic ﬂexibility is es-
sential in order to correctly estimate the energy of the
DNA loop, as well as the local bend and twist at each
point of the loop. The electrostatic interactions are im-
portant in the case of a close contact of the loop with
itself or with other molecules (Sec. V). The universality
of our approach allows us to include all these cases into
the scope of approachable problems.

Moreover, all the DNA parameters: the bending mod-
uli, the intrinsic twist and curvature, the charge den-
sity – are treated in our equations as functions of the
arclength. This provides an automatic tool for study-
ing the sequence-dependent properties of the DNA loops.
The elastic moduli and intrinsic parameters need to be
speciﬁed for diﬀerent DNA sequences, e.g., as outlined
in [20, 38, 57]. Then the properties of any loop are ap-
1,2(s), ω◦(s),
proximated by functions α(s), β(s), γ(s), κ◦
smoothly changing their values between those associated
with each base pair in the loop sequence (as discussed
in App. D) and the inﬂuence of the DNA sequence on
the conformation and energy of that loop can be stud-
ied by simply substituting their functions associated with
diﬀerent DNA sequences into Eqs. (36-46). Of course, ex-
tensive testing of such parameters and comparison with
experimental results on DNA bending and loop energet-
ics has to be done prior to performing any such studies
of sequence-dependent eﬀects.

Another opportunity that our model provides consists
in its ability to mimic the eﬀect of protein binding within
DNA loops. For example, if a protein is known to bend
DNA over a certain region [86] then the intrinsic curva-
ture term can be adjusted so as to enforce the required
curvature over that region of the DNA loop. To strictly
enforce the curvature, the rigidity of that region would
have to be increased as well. Studying the solutions to the
Kirchhoﬀ equations with such intrinsic curvature term

would reveal what changes to the energy and conforma-
tion occur in the DNA loop upon binding of the speciﬁed
protein. A recent study [58, 59] of the CAP protein bind-
ing within the lac repressor loop, performed in this vein,
suggested an explanation for the experimentally observed
cooperation between the CAP and the lac repressor in
DNA binding [60, 61].

Certainly, the diﬀerent features of our model have to be
used only as each speciﬁc problems dictates. For exam-
ple, the model of isotropically ﬂexible DNA seems suﬃ-
cient for determining the global properties of DNA loops,
such as the linking numbers of diﬀerent conformations,
their radii of gyration, or the energy distribution between
bend and twist. In the present study, increasing the com-
plexity of the model and varying the elasticity properties
did not much change the shape of the loop, which deter-
mines these global properties (cf. Figs. 4, 7-10, 14, 15).
Presumably, the reduced model should be suﬃcient for
computing the global properties of other DNA loops.

If, however, the energy of the loop has to be estimated,
or the energies of diﬀerent loop conformations need to
be compared, or, indeed, the local structure at a cer-
tain point of the loop needs to be predicted, with a view
to study how binding of a certain protein in that area
changes upon the loop formation – then the anisotropic
loop model becomes imperative, as it has been demon-
strated in Sec. IV. Finally, the problems which involve
loop conformations with a near self-contact – such as
those of the O loop or the tightly wound superhelical
structures [29, 54, 62] – necessitate including the elec-
trostatic force term into Kirchhoﬀ equations. The same
holds for the problems studying the eﬀect of salt concen-
tration on structure and energetics of DNA loops.

The speed and high adaptability of our modeling ap-
proach makes it a good candidate for multi-scale mod-
eling simulations. The most obvious application would
be to study the structure and dynamics of a system sim-
ilar to the lac repressor-DNA complex: a protein or a
protein aggregate holding a long DNA loop. The struc-
ture of the loop and the forces and torques that the loop
exerts on the protein are directly obtainable from the
elastic rod computations. Such forces would normally
consist of the elastic forces at the loop boundaries and,
perhaps, the electrostatic forces if parts of the DNA loop
approach the protein-DNA complex closely. The elec-
trostatic forces are directly computable from the pre-
dicted loop geometry. The forces and torques can then
be plugged in an all-atom simulation of the structure of
the protein aggregate and the DNA segments directly
bound to it, similarly to how it is done in steered molec-
ular dynamics simulations [63, 64]. The state of the DNA
segments that provide the boundaries of the DNA loop
can be routinely checked during the all-atom simulations.
Whenever a notable change in the positions and orienta-
tions of the boundaries occur, the coarse-grained elastic
computations have to be repeated (using the previous so-
lutions as the initial guess) and the simulations continue
with the updated values of the forces and torques. The

23

fast coarse-grained computations presented here result in
only a marginal increase in the total time required for the
all-atom simulation. The multi-scale simulations provide
a direct means to study the changes in structure and dy-
namics of the the protein aggregate under the force of
the DNA loop it creates.

Another application of multi-scale modeling could be
to a system where several proteins bind to the same
DNA loop and alter the DNA geometry at or near their
binding sites. Such systems arise during gene transcrip-
tion, when multiple transcription factors and RNA poly-
merase components bind at or near a gene promoter,
during DNA replication when helicases and gyrases con-
currently alter the DNA topology, inside eukaryotic chro-
matin with multiple nucleosomes clustering on long DNA
threads [3]. Simulations of the separate protein-DNA
complexes could be run on atomic scale, and the stress
imposed on the DNA in one simulation could be passed to
another via an elastic rod model of the DNA segment(s)
connecting the diﬀerent complexes. The binding of some
proteins could even be mimicked with the intrinsic cur-
vature and twist terms, as outlined above.

Finally, the local DNA geometry predicted in our
model can be used to replace the coarse-grained elastic
ribbon with an all-atom DNA structure in selected areas
of the loop or even over the whole loop (cf App. F). An
example is shown in Fig. 3 c, d, where the all-atom struc-
ture was placed on top of the predicted 76 bp and 385 bp
U loops. A local segment of the all-atom structure can
be simulated with the forces and torques from the rest
of the loop applied to its boundaries – using the same
multi-scale simulation technique as outlined above. The
segment can be simulated on its own, so as to compare
the segment’s structural dynamics in an unconstrained
conformation, or inside the large bent loop. Or, if the
segment in question is a binding site of a certain protein,
that protein could be docked to the DNA segment, and
the simulation of the two would allow one to study the
changes in the protein binding to DNA upon the loop
formation. With the advent of the computational power,
even the simulations of the all-atom structures of mod-
erately sized DNA loops, such as the 76 bp loop stud-
ied here, would become possible. For such a simulation,
the all-atom loop structure, predicted on the basis of the
elastic loop model, can serve as a good starting point.

C. Further developments

Naturally, before being used in such advanced simula-
tions, the model has to be reﬁned and extensively tested
using all the available experimental data. In the present
state, we have not even converged to a single preferred
set of elastic moduli, as a whole family of values may
account for the lac repressor loop bending energies. Re-
ﬁning and adjustment of the model parameters on the
basis of other data is at this point imperative for mak-
ing the suggested universal elastic model fully functional

on all levels. Such data can come from the experiments
on DNA interaction with other DNA-binding proteins,
including topoisomerases [66, 67], from the energetics of
DNA minicircles [68, 69], and from the analysis of defor-
mations in DNA X-ray structures, following the ideas of
Olson et al [20, 38].

Another necessary adjustment would have to account
for the well-known sequence-speciﬁcity of DNA proper-
ties [20, 38, 57]. The bending moduli have to be deter-
mined in the sequence-speciﬁc fashion, as functions of the
arclength s, varying according to the DNA sequence at
each point of the studied loop (see App. D). The intrin-
sic curvatures κ◦
1,2 and varying intrinsic twist ω◦ are also
known to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the structure and
dynamics of some DNA sequences [20, 31, 62] and pa-
rameterizing these functions is therefore also important
for our model.

Before the parameters are better deﬁned, the model is
still good for solving general problems, such as selection
between alternative DNA loop topologies or energy es-
timates within several kT, as discussed in the previous
section, but not for more subtle quantitative predictions
of the structural and energetical properties of DNA loops.
Several extensions to the model may prove necessary
in order to achieve realistic DNA descriptions in certain
cases. One obvious extension is including DNA deforma-
bility into Eqs. (36-46). DNA is known to be a shearable
and extensible molecule, as is evidenced by the deforma-
tions observed in the all-atom structures [87] or microma-
nipulation experiments [7, 37, 70]. The DNA deforma-
bility can inﬂuence both the local and global structure
of the modeled DNA, especially in view of the observed
In
coupling between the DNA stretch and twist [71].
order to include the DNA deformability in our model,
Eqs. (36-46) have to be modiﬁed as outlined in App. E,
raising the order of the system (36-46) to 16.

Another vital modiﬁcation consists in adding a steric
repulsion parameter to the other force terms.
In the
present study, there was no need for such a term be-
cause of its insigniﬁcance compared to the DNA self-
repulsion. However, if the DNA interaction with a posi-
tively charged object (e.g., the histone core of the nucle-
osome) is to be described, then the steric repulsion term
becomes imperative lest the elastic solutions collapse on
the positive charges, causing non-convergence of the it-
erative process. The steric repulsion can be described
as the van der Waals ’6-12’ potential and would not be
qualitatively diﬀerent from the electrostatic repulsion in-
troduced in (52). Only the electric charges in eq. (52)
have to be replaced by the van der Waals coeﬃcients, the
degrees of the denominators have to be changed to 6 or
12, and the inverse screening radius has to be set to zero
– otherwise, the forces of steric repulsion are computed in
the same way and through the same iterative algorithm
applied to solving the integro-diﬀerential equations.

As for the electrostatic self-repulsion, its description
in our model can be rendered more realistic by placing
the phosphate charges on the outside of the double he-

24

lix rather than on the centerline as in the present sim-
pliﬁed treatment (52). Placing the phosphates at the
points ρ1 ~d1(s) + ρ2 ~d2(s) of the rod cross-section, where
ρ1 and ρ2 are determined by the DNA chemical struc-
ture (Fig. 2), would result in replacing the radii ~r(s) in
eq. (52) by ~RP h(s) = ~r(s) + ρ1 ~d1(s) + ρ2 ~d2(s). That
would make the electric ﬁeld dependent not only on the
radius-vector ~r(s), but also on the the Euler parameters
qi=1−4(s) that determine the orientation of the local co-
ordinate frame. This additional dependence is unlikely
to result in any algorithmic diﬃculties with solving the
equations. Physically, however, moving the phosphate
charges away from the centerline means introducing ex-
ternal torques in each cross-section in additional to exter-
nal forces, and the torques could change the calculated
loop structure – again, unlikely in the general case, but
possibly in the case of a close approach of the charged
elastic ribbon to itself or any other charged object in-
volved in the model.

As has been noted above, the discussed modeling
method produces static, zero-temperature structures of
DNA loops. Yet, the entropic contribution to the free
energy of diﬀerent DNA states may sometimes be im-
Interestingly, there is a way to estimate the
portant.
structural entropy of a DNA loop with our method. One
could employ the intrinsic curvature/twist terms and per-
form statistical sampling by assigning bends and unwind-
ing/overwinding with the energetic penalty between 0
and 1 kT at random points of the loop, analyzing the
resulting changes in the loop structure and energy. Since
the zero temperature structure of the loop is used as the
starting point in the iterative calculations of the ran-
domly bent and twisted structures, the iterations should
converge much faster than those running from scratch.
Thus the ensemble of thermally excited structures can
be generated and used to obtain the properties of the
studied DNA loop at a ﬁnal temperature. The entropy of
each looped state can be estimated, for example, through
the volume of space swept by all the diﬀerent structures
from the thermal ensemble.

With the modiﬁcations, outlined above, the proposed
model is likely to describe DNA loops very realistically,
yet still be less detailed and computationally much faster
than all-atom models. One drawback, however, lies in
the non-linear nature of the elastic problems. The solu-
tions to the equations of elasticity are known to exhibit
a non-trivial dependence on the problem parameters, for
example, the boundary conditions. A latent response to
the change of a certain condition can lead to an abrupt
change in the shape of the BVP solution, for example, if
the point of instability of the latter is achieved. If the so-
lution changes too abruptly, the iterative procedure will
fail due to non-convergence of the BVP solver. Another
reason for the non-convergence is meeting a bifurcation
point, as it happened at low salt concentrations with the
U′ and O′ solutions for the 385 bp loop (Sec. V C).

Such problems seem to be inherent to our method.
If they are encountered, we would recommend to thor-

oughly analyze the nature of the non-convergence, for ex-
ample, through monitoring the evolution of the interme-
diate solutions prior to the non-convergence. In the case
of abrupt changes, the ultimate structure can perhaps be
guessed, or achieved along a diﬀerent pathway with an
equivalent endpoint that might not be leading the rod
through the point of abrupt change (for instance, rotat-
ing the end of the elastic rod counterclockwise by 2π
φ
if a clockwise rotation by φ is causing problems). In the
case of a bifurcation, the bifurcating solutions branches
need to be analyzed – which by itself may provide useful
insights into the structural properties and transforma-
tions of the studied loop.

D. Lac repressor loops

To conclude the paper, let us summarize what has been
learned with our method about the speciﬁc system, the
lac repressor and its DNA loop. For both possible lengths
of the loop, it has been shown that the underwound loop
structure pointing away from the lac repressor should
be predominant under thermodynamic equilibrium con-
ditions, unless other biomolecules interfere. The pre-
dicted structure of the U loop depends only slightly on
the salt concentration, although the loop energy exhibits
a stronger dependence. The experimentally observed en-
ergy of the loop can be obtained with the right com-
bination of parameters - which, of course, have to be
extensively tested with other protein-DNA systems.

Another reason why the predicted structure of the
DNA loop has to be treated with caution is the dy-
namic nature of the lac repressor-DNA complex. The X-
ray structure [40], on which our conclusions were based,
has been obtained without the DNA loop connecting the
protein-bound DNA pieces and, therefore, can be pre-
sumably changed by the stress of the bent DNA loop.
Yet, our results pave the way for analyzing these changes.
The forces of the protein-DNA interactions, computed
with our model, can be applied in a multi-scale simulation
of the lac repressor-DNA complex, as described above.
Such simulation would reveal the equilibrium state of the
lac repressor with the bound DNA loop, or at least show
the spectrum of structural states visited by the protein
during its dynamics with the attached loop.

The results of such dynamics may even change our con-
clusions about the structure and energetics of the DNA
loops created by the lac repressor. When the boundary
conditions change, the O loop can become energetically
preferable to the U loop, or even one of the dismissed
extraneous solutions may become feasible. Yet, to make
multi-scale simulations possible, that would study the
complexes between lac repressor, or other proteins, and
the DNA loops in their dynamic nature, was the driv-
ing force behind the development of our coarse-grained
DNA model – which, per se, does not pretend to yield
ﬁnal conclusions about the lac repressor-DNA complex.

VII. CONCLUSION

25

In conclusion, a universal theoretical model of DNA
loops has been presented. The model uniﬁes several exist-
ing DNA models and provides description of many phys-
ical properties of real DNA: anisotropic ﬂexibility, salt-
dependent electrostatic self-repulsion, intrinsic twist and
curvature – all the properties being sequence-dependent.
The model is applicable to a broad range of problems
regarding the interactions of DNA-binding proteins with
DNA segments of moderate length (100–1,000 bp) and
can serve as a basis of all-atom or multi-scale simula-
tions of protein-DNA complexes. The application of the
model to the lac repressor-DNA complex revealed a likely
structure of the 76 bp and 385 bp DNA loops, created by
the protein. The experimentally measured energy of the
DNA loop formation is obtainable with a proper set of
parameters. The obtained forces of the protein-DNA in-
teractions can be used in a multi-scale simulation of the
lac repressor-DNA complex. Further comparison with
experimental data will be beneﬁcial for optimizing the
parameters and approximations of the model.

we arrive at (49).

According to [41, 46], the equilibrium constant of bind-
ing of the lac repressor to a single-operator DNA equals
about 10−11 M for O1 and 10−9 M for O3 at high salt
concentration (0.2 M). This results in the free energies

Since the rod is tightly twisted, the term s < ω◦ >s
grows much faster with s than both other terms in (C2)

APPENDIX D

The sequence-dependent parameters could be related
to the arclength of the rod in several possible ways. The
simplest would be a step-wise assignment of the parame-
ters. At the points, corresponding to each DNA step be-
tween two neighboring base pairs, the parameters (elas-
tic moduli α, β, and γ, intrinsic curvature κ◦
1,2 and twist
ω◦) would adopt the values correspondent to that DNA
step. Connecting those points with smooth functions (for
example, spline-based ones) would result in the desired
parameter setup α(s), β(s), etc., for the particular loop.
A slightly modiﬁed approach could keep the DNA
step-based parameters constant in a certain area in the
middle between the base pairs and limit the zone of a
smooth transition from value to value to a certain width
δ. Then, the sequence-based parameter functions be-
tween the DNA steps to and from the base pair located
at the point si would look like:

Finally, a more complicated approach can relate the
parameters to a longer DNA sequence surrounding each
point s rather than to only three neighboring base pairs
deﬁning the two adjacent DNA steps. Such approach
would be more realistic, as the experimental and sim-
ulation data indicate [38, 57].
In that case, the model
parameter functions would have to depend on multiple
base pairs neighboring each point s, for example, as de-
scribed in [57].

APPENDIX E

The DNA deformability can be described in our model
by additional three variables, combined into the shift vec-
tor ~ǫ(s). Its components ǫ1,2 are the amount of shear in
the two principal directions, and the component ǫ3 is the
amount of extension along the normal ~d3 [28, 29]. The
vector of shift ~ǫ and the elastic force ~N are linearly re-
lated to each other, similarly to the vector of curvature
~k and the torque ~M (cf eq. (15)):

~N (s) = B1ǫ1 ~d1 + B2ǫ2 ~d2 + Dǫ3 ~d3 ,

(E1)

Uκ =

K 2ds ,

where B1,2 are the shear moduli in the two principal di-
rections, and D is the extension modulus of DNA. Those

parameters would also have to be determined from and
extensively veriﬁed against the experimental data, e.g.
those presented in [38, 51].

Thus introduced, deformability changes eq. (1) into

˙~r = ~ǫ + ~d3 ,

(E2)

propagating into eq. (14). Finally, the systems (20-30),
(36-46) become of 16-th rather than 13-th order, but
could be similarly solved by the continuation method.

APPENDIX F

The following algorithm has been used in this work
to build all-atom DNA structures on the basis of coarse-
grained elastic rod solutions. First, the all-atom struc-
tures of the base pairs, with the sugar phosphate back-
bone groups attached, were built in the idealized B-
conformations using Quanta [73]. Second, the chosen

27

elastic rod solution was used to obtain local coordinate
frames ( ~d1(sbp,i), ~d2(sbp,i), ~d3(sbp,i) ) from qi(sbp,i) [34]
at each point sbp,i = ih/L corresponding to the loca-
tion of each base pair of the loop along the centerline
of the DNA helix. Third, the all-atom base pairs were
centered at the points ~r(sbp,i) and aligned with the co-
ordinate frames ( ~d1(sbp,i), ~d2(sbp,i), ~d3(sbp,i) ) as illus-
trated in Fig. 2. Fourth, the sugar phosphate groups
were connected with each other and the lac repressor-
bound DNA segments by phosphodiester bonds. Fifth,
two 50-step minimization rounds with X-PLOR [74] us-
ing CHARM22 force ﬁeld [75] were performed in order
to relieve bad interatomic contacts and chemical group
conformations (bonds, angles, dihedral angles) resulting
from this idealized placement, especially for the DNA
backbone. The resulting all-atom structure, while still
stressed at certain points and overidealized at others,
presents a reasonable starting point for any all-atom or
multi-scale simulations, as described in Sec. VI B.

[77] All the variables in this paper, apart from a few clear
exceptions, are considered to be functions of arclength s.
Therefore, we frequently drop the explicit notation “(s)”
from the equations throughout the paper.

[80] Promoter is a regulatory DNA region located upstream
from the set of genes it controls and containing binding
sites for RNA polymerase and regulatory proteins.
[81] The DNA segments were co-crystallized together with
the protein for two reasons: (i) to reveal the structure of
the DNA-binding domains of the lac repressor, which are
partially unfolded when not binding a piece of DNA [40];
(ii) to reveal the structure of the protein-DNA interface.
[82] In fact, the boundaries of the loop were placed on the
third base pair from the end of each DNA segment. The
two terminal base pairs were disregarded, because their
structure was seriously disrupted, apparently, due to in-
teractions with solvent. Moreover, the two terminal base
pairs do not contact the lac repressor, so their structure
and orientation could easily change within the continuous
DNA loop.

[83] In principle, the exact solution to begin the iterations
with could be obtained by solving Eqs. (36-46) analyti-
cally, as described in [25], in the case of an isotropically
ﬂexible (α = β) elastic loop. That would save us the ﬁrst
three iteration cycles. However, for that to be possible,
the boundary conditions had to be symmetric, that is,
the angles between the normal ~d3 to the cross-section
and the end-to-end vector ~r(1) − ~r(0) had to be the same
at both s = 0 and s = 1 ends. In our case, the angles
in question were equal to 65◦ and 99◦ at the s = 0 and
s = 1 ends, respectively.

[84] The persistence length of DNA bending has universally
been measured to be around LA = 500 ˚A [36, 56]. There is
less agreement as to what the twisting persistence length
should be, but most of the recent data agree on the value
of LC = 750 ˚A [37]. From the relations for the bending
and twisting moduli A = LAkT and C = LC kT [47] one
obtains A = 1.5 · 10−19erg·cm, C = 3 · 10−19erg·cm, and
A/C = LA/LC = 2/3.

[85] To characterize the diﬀerence between two elastic loop so-
lutions L and L′ for the lac repressor problem, this paper
employs the root-mean square deviation between the cen-
terlines ~r(s) and ~r′(s) of those loops, deﬁned as follows:
1
0 |~r(s) − ~r′(s)| ds. Typically, the r.m.s.d. will

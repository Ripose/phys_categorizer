Abstract

We employ a molecular model to study a ternary mixture of saturated lipid, with tails of sixteen

carbons, a mono unsaturated lipid with tails of eighteen carbons, and cholesterol. The model,

solved within mean-ﬁeld theory, produces several forms of phase diagrams depending upon the

relative strengths of interactions, but only one that shows the coexistence of two liquid phases

observed in experiment. The lipids in the phase rich in cholesterol are more ordered than those in

the other. The binary cholesterol, saturated lipid system also exhibits liquid, liquid coexistence.

There has been enormous interest in the hypothesis that the lipids comprising the plasma

membrane are distributed inhomogeneously, with regions rich in cholesterol and saturated

lipids ﬂoating, like rafts, in a sea of unsaturated lipids. Such rafts have been implicated in

many biological processes including endocytosis, transcription and transduction processes,

and viral infection. The extent of the interest is reﬂected in the number of recent reviews

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It has spurred numerous in vitro investigation of ternary systems of cholesterol

and a high-melting point (hmp) lipid, either sphingomyelin or a saturated glycerolipid, and

a glycerolipid whose melting point is lower, either because it is unsaturated [6, 7, 8, 9] or

because, although saturated, it is relatively short [10, 11]. A major question the ternary

studies could address is whether the aggregation phenomenon indicated in vivo might simply

be attributed to liquid-liquid phase separation. If so, it could be observed in vitro. The

assumption was that one ﬂuid, the liquid disordered (ld) phase, would be rich in the low-

melting-point (lmp) lipid, while the other, the liquid ordered (lo) phase, would be rich in

cholesterol and the hmp lipid. The nomenclature “liquid ordered” [12] signiﬁes that there

are fewer thermally excited gauche bonds in the hydrocarbon tails of the lipid chains in

this phase than in the liquid disordered phase. In addition to these two phases, a gel phase

occurs below the melting, or main chain transition temperature, of the hmp lipid when the

concentration of this lipid is large. This phase is the most ordered of the three.

While there is some agreement on broad features in the interior of the ternary diagrams,

there is also considerable uncertainty. In particular the approach to the cholesterol, hmp lipid

binary system, and the phase diagram of that system itself remain a matter of controversy.

The disagreement centers on whether or not there is coexistence of two liquid phases over

some range of temperature even in this binary system.

Evidence of such coexistence derives from several studies using diﬀerent probes: electron

spin resonance [13], freeze fracture electron microscopy [14], nuclear magnetic resonance

(NMR) [15], ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer [16], and other ﬂuorescence studies [9].

Perhaps the strongest evidence, however, is indirect, coming from calorimetry [15, 17]. In

the cholesterol, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) system, these measurements clearly

show a very large and narrow speciﬁc heat signal at a temperature which is rather constant

over a range of compositions, the standard indicator of a triple point. The signal was so

interpreted by Vist and Davis [15]. Given the undisputed existence of a gel phase which

coexists with a liquid phase at low temperature, the observation of a triple point leads to

2

the conclusion of the existence of a gel and two liquid phases at higher temperatures. There

is NMR evidence for such a triple point in another cholesterol, hmp lipid system as well [18].

There are also arguments against the existence of two liquid phases in the cholesterol,

hmp lipid system. First, the sharp speciﬁc heat signals have been interpreted as not arising

from three-phase coexistence by McElhaney and co-workers [17], and they also dispute the

conclusion drawn by Vist and Davis from their NMR experiments. Indeed the NMR work

of Huang et al.

[19] found no such coexistence, nor did those using ﬂuorescence recovery

after photo bleaching [20]. Fluorescence microscopy also does not observe phase separation

in these systems [7, 8]. Even if the behavior of this binary system were clear, its relation

to that of the canonical 1:1:1 raft composition would not be. The question would remain

whether the coexistence of liquids in this part of the ternary system was directly related to

such coexistence in the binary system.

To clarify the ternary system and its evolution from the binary one, we have carried out a

study based upon a microscopic model. Previous theoretical investigations of these mixtures

have been limited to the binary systems of cholesterol and hmp lipid [12, 21, 22], or hmp

and lmp lipids [23]. Notable among the former is the pioneering study of Ipsen et al. which

coined the description “liquid-ordered phase” [12].

Our ternary mixture consists of cholesterol, a lipid with two saturated tails of sixteen

carbons, C16:0, and another with two mono-unsaturated tails of eighteen carbons, C18:1.

There are essentially two adjustable interaction parameters in the model, and their variation

produces three distinct phase diagrams. One is clearly irrelevant to experiment, one is con-

sistent with claims of no liquid, liquid coexistence in the binary system, and one is consistent

with claims that there is. Only the last of these exhibits the liquid, liquid coexistence in the

heart of the ternary diagram, consistent with experiments.

In our model, the lipids tails are described using the Flory rotational isomeric states

representation [24]. One introduces the local volume fraction per unit length for a lipid tail
in a particular conﬁguration, ˆφσ(z),

ˆφσ(z) =

νσ(k)δ[z − zk],

nσ

Xk=1

(1)

where the z direction is perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer, σ = s or u is an index
indicating whether the lipid is saturated or unsaturated, the ν(k) = 28˚A3 ≡ ν0, the volume
of the k’th monomer if it is a CH2, or 56˚A3 if a CH3 group, and ns = 15, nu = 17. The local

3

orientation of the chain is conveniently speciﬁed by the normal to the plane determined by

the k’th CH2 group,

uσ,k =

rk−1 − rk+1
|rk−1 − rk+1|

,

k = 1...ns − 1.

(2)

A similar local volume fraction is introduced for the cholesterol, with index σ = c, nc = 27
and νc(k) ≈21.0˚A3. The orientation of the small acyl chain of the cholesterol is speciﬁed in

the same manner as are the lipid chains, while the orientation of its rigid rings are speciﬁed

by the unit vector, uc, from the third to the seventeenth carbon in the molecule, using the

conventional labeling.

In earlier theories, [25, 26], the eﬀect of the short-range repulsive and long-range attractive

interactions between elements was accounted for approximately by replacing them by a

constraint that the density within the hydrophobic region be constant locally. The free
energy of the system can then be written in terms of the ˆφ. While accounting well for many

properties of bilayers, this theory cannot lead to a main chain transition to a gel phase.

Hence we have added [23] an additional separable interaction per unit volume which tends

to align the elements with each other and with the bilayer normal c:

Vσ,σ′ = −(Jσ,σ′/ν0)g(uσ · c)g(uσ′ · c),

g(uσ · c) ≡ (m + 1/2)(uσ · c)2m

(3)

(4)

For large m, g ≈ m exp(−mθ2) where θ is the angle between the two unit vectors. Matching

lipid parameters, we have taken m = 18. Note that this interaction between two vectors

falls oﬀ exponentially if either of them is not well aligned with the bilayer normal. We

take the strength of the local interactions between bonds in lipid tails to be the same,

Jss = Juu = Jsu ≡ Jll, irrespective of whether the bonds are in a saturated or unsaturated

chain, and the interaction strength between the cholesterol and any bond in a lipid tail to be

the same, Jsc = Juc ≡ Jlc, irrespective of the type of lipid chain. Thus the model contains

three interaction strengths: Jll which is set by the main chain transition temperature, Jlc,

and Jcc the strength of the aligning interaction between cholesterols.

Just as the ˆφ describe the local density, so we introduce a function which describes the

local ordering with respect to the bilayer normal [27]:

ˆξσ(z) =

νσ(k)δ(z − zk)g(uσ · c).

The Helmholtz free energy per unit area, fA(T, ρs, ρu, ρc), with ρσ = Nσ/A, σ = s or u,

the areal density of saturated or unsaturated chains, and ρc = Nc/A the areal density of

cholesterol, can now be obtained directly within mean-ﬁeld theory. One ﬁnds

and H1 contains the intra chain energy arising from the presence of gauche bonds. The

three unknown ﬁelds Bs = Bu ≡ Bl, Bc, and Π are obtained from minimization of the free
energy with respect to the < ˆξσ > and < ˆφσ > which leads to the three local self consistent

equations

Bc = −β{Jlc[ρs < ˆξs > +ρu < ˆξu >] + Jccρc < ˆξc >}.

The ﬁrst of these is simply the incompressibility constraint.

The heart of the above method, and its diﬃculty, is the evaluation of the single molecule
partition functions Qσ. To evaluate them, we have generated on the order of 107 conﬁgura-

tions of each molecule. Finally the eﬀect of the water, lipid interface is taken into account

via a contribution to the free energy per unit area of γ0, set equal to the oil, water tension.

Thus the total free energy per unit area, or surface tension, is ftot(T, ρs, ρu, ρc) = fA + γ0.

We look for phases for which this surface tension vanishes. Phase equilibria is determined

by standard thermodynamic equalities [23].

We now turn to the results of our calculation. The binary phase diagram of unsaturated

and saturated lipids [23] depends upon packing constraints and the lipid-lipid interaction

strength Jll which we set by matching the main chain transition of the saturated lipid to
T ∗ = 315K, that of DPPC. Below this temperature there is a gel phase, rich in the saturated

lipid, and a disordered liquid phase rich in the unsaturated lipid. The main chain transi-
tion temperature of the unsaturated lipid is below 0◦C. The nature of the ternary diagram

depends upon the relative strengths, Jlc and Jcc of the lipid-cholesterol and cholesterol-

cholesterol aligning interactions. We ﬁnd essentially three classes of diagrams.

The ﬁrst occurs when the other two interactions are weak compared to Jll. For the binary

cholesterol, saturated lipid system, this results only in gel and ld phases, and therefore no

liquid, liquid coexistence, consistent with one side of the controversy noted earlier. The

three binary phase diagrams as a function of temperature and composition are shown in

Fig. 1(a). A ternary diagram at a temperature below the main chain temperature is shown

in Fig. 1(b). There is no region of liquid-liquid coexistence. As such regions can be seen

directly in the experimental ternary systems [6, 7, 8], this choice of interactions does not

apply.

A second class of diagram occurs if the lipid cholesterol aligning interaction, Jlc, is domi-

nant. This produces a gel phase which is swollen with cholesterol. As there is no experimental

evidence for this, we do not consider this choice of interactions further.

A third class of diagram occurs when the interaction between cholesterols is at least

comparable to that between lipids. Binary phase diagrams based on our calculations are

FIG. 2: Figure 2a. Binary phase diagrams for Jlc = 0.78Jll and Jcc = 0.73Jll, and Jll as in Fig.

1. The saturated lipid-cholesterol mixture has a triple point very near the main-chain transition

temperature, so that the gel, ld coexistence region is very narrow. Dashed lines are extrapolations.

The ternary mixture at T = 300K is shown in Fig. 2b.

shown in Fig. 2(a). In the cholesterol, saturated lipid system, there is coexistence of two

liquid phases over a range of high temperatures, and a temperature of three-phase coexistence

with a gel phase, consistent with refs [13]-[16]. A cut through the ternary diagram at a

temperature of T = 300K below the triple temperature is shown in Fig. 2 (b). There

is a large region of coexistence of the lo, ld, and gel phases. There are three regions of

two-phase coexistence which extend to the binary axes. The coexistence region between lo

and ld liquids would be identiﬁed as the region in which rafts could exist. The diagram is

topologically identical to that reported in ref [9].

The degree of order, SCD, in the lipid chains is given in terms of the second Legendre

polynomial |SCD| = |P2(θk)|/2, where θk is the angle between the normals to the bilayer and

to the plane of the k’th CH2 group. The order parameter for the saturated lipids is shown

in Fig. 3 for each of the three phases which coexist in the phase diagram of Fig. 2b. As

can be seen, the chains in the lo phase are indeed more ordered than those in the ld phase.

This increased order is due to the interactions of the lipids with cholesterol, which is itself

well ordered. We have also veriﬁed that the addition of cholesterol tends to disorder the gel

phase, in agreement with experiment [15].

The evolution of the ternary diagram with increasing temperature is simple. The region

of three-phase coexistence shrinks and vanishes at the triple temperature of the binary

cholesterol, hmp lipid system. Above the main chain temperature of this lipid, there is a two-

phase region of lo and ld coexistence which stretches from one binary system with cholesterol

to the other. At higher temperatures, this region detaches from the binary cholesterol, lmp

lipid axis at a critical point, and the region shrinks with further increase of temperature

until it vanishes at a critical point on the cholesterol, hmp lipid axis. It is clear from the

evolution of our calculated ternary diagram that the liquid, liquid coexistence within our

ternary diagram is intimately tied to a similar coexistence in the binary cholesterol, saturated

lipid system. Given that the coexistence of liquids has been observed in the ternary systems,

the calculation gives strong support to the view that such coexistence already exists in the

cholesterol, hmp lipid system as well.

In this paper, the diﬀusion entropy technique is applied to investigate the scaling behavior of
stride interval ﬂuctuations of human gait. The scaling behavior of the stride interval of human
walking at normal, slow and fast rate are similar; with the scale-invariance exponents in the interval
[0.663, 0.955], of which the mean value is 0.821 ± 0.011. Dynamical analysis of these stride interval
ﬂuctuations reveals a self-similar pattern: Fluctuation at one time scale are statistically similar to
those at multiple other time scales, at least over hundreds of steps, while the healthy subjects walk
at their normal rate. The long-range correlations are observed during the spontaneous walking after
the removal of the trend in the time series with Fourier ﬁlter. These ﬁndings uncover that the fractal
dynamics of stride interval of human gait are normally intrinsic to the locomotor systems.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, it has been recognized that in many natu-
ral sequences the elements are not positioned randomly,
but exhibit long-range correlations and fractal dynam-
ics. Prominent examples include noncoding DNA se-
quences [1], human heartbeat [2, 3], human brain elec-
troencephalogram [4], teenagers’ births in Texas [5], and
ﬁnancial time series [6]. The common feature of all these
diverse systems with long-range correlations is that scal-
ing behavior decay by a power law, where a characteristic
scale is absent, and the scaling behavior is usually rather
robust and universal.

The scaling behavior in complex systems is not only in-
teresting in physical sense, but also provides an intrinsic
description of the system, and highlights the system dy-
namical mechanism. Several useful variance-based meth-
ods, such as the probability moment method [7] and the
ﬂuctuation approach as well as the de-trended ﬂuctuation
approach [1], are proposed to detect the scale-invariance
properties. However, these variance-based methods have
two basic shortcomings. One is that the scale-invariance
property can be detected but the value of the exponent
cannot be obtained accurately. The other is that for some
processes, like the L´evy ﬂight, the variance tends to inﬁ-
nite and these methods are unavailable at all [8, 9]. Al-
though the inﬁnite can not be reached due to the ﬁnite
records of empirical data, clearly we will obtain mislead-
ing information about the dynamics under these condi-
tions.

The dynamics of human gait is relative to locomotor
system’s synthesizing inputs from the motor cortex, the
basal ganglia and the cerebellum, as well as feedback
from the vestibular, visual and proprioceptive sources.

Therefore, to investigate the scaling behavior of the stride
interval ﬂuctuations of human gait is very interesting
with both the physical and physiological communities.
By using some recently proposed approaches for non-
linear data, some scientists studied the statistical char-
acters of the stride interval ﬂuctuations of human gait
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Hausdorﬀ et al [10, 11]
demonstrated that the stride interval time series exhibits
long-range correlations, suggesting that the human gait
displays a self-similar activity. Subsequent studies, by
West et al and Goldberger et al [12, 13, 14, 15], sup-
ported the above conclusion, and several dynamics mod-
els are established to mimic the human gait [18, 19].
Furthermore, Perc [17] found that the human gait pro-
cess possesses some typical properties like a deterministic
chaotic system. In this paper, we apply the diﬀusion en-
tropy (DE) technique to accurately detect and obtain the
scaling property of stride interval ﬂuctuations of human
gait on a Fourier analysis.

II. DIFFUSION ENTROPY TECHNIQUE
BASED ON FOURIER ANALYSIS

To overcome the mentioned shortcomings in the
variance-based methods, Grigolini et al.
[8, 9] designed
the approach named diﬀusion entropy analysis (DEA).
To keep our description as self-contained as possible, we
brieﬂy review the DEA method.

Consider a complex system containing a large amount
of particles. The scale-invariance property in the diﬀu-
sion process of this system can be described mathemati-
cally with the probability distribution function as

P (x, t) =

1
tδ F (

x
tδ ),

where x is the displacements of the particles in the com-
plex system and δ the scale−invariance exponent. The

The DEA method has been used to analysis many time
series in diﬀerent research ﬁelds, such as the solar in-
duced atmosphere temperature series [22], the intermit-
tency time series in ﬂuid turbulence [23], the spectra of
complex networks [24], the output spike trains of neurons
[25], the index of ﬁnancial market [26], and so on.

III. DATA ANALYSIS

FIG. 1: A typical example about the stride interval ﬂuctua-
tion of human gait.

theoretical foundation of this property is the Central
Limit Theorem and the Generalized Central Limit Theo-
rem [20, 21]. For δ = 0.5, the diﬀusion process is the stan-
dard diﬀusion and F (y) is the Gaussian function. And
δ 6= 0.5 indicates the deviation of the dynamical process
from the normal stochastic one. For example, the case
with δ > 0.5 corresponds to the diﬀusion process of L´evy
walk.

For a time series, the delay-register vectors, denoted
with {yk, yk+1, · · ·, yk+m−1|k = 1, 2, 3, · · ·, N − m + 1},
can be regarded as the trajectories of N − m + 1 particles
during the period of 0 to m.
In this way we can map
a time series to a diﬀusion process, called overlapping
diﬀusion process here. An alternative solution is to sepa-
rate the considered time series into many non-overlapping
segments and regard these segments as the trajectories.
To make the data suitable for the illustration of scaling
behavior at all scales, we propose a method based on
the Fourier transform to detrend the nonstationary trend
in whole temporal domain. First, transform the time
series to Fourier space and then, use the invert Fourier
transform to obtain the time series with cutoﬀ coeﬃcient.
We consider the curtailed time series as the trend and
subtract it from original series. Then, the ﬁnal time series
is regarded as a steady series, whose overlapping diﬀusion
process reads

xk(t) =

ζj, k = 1, 2, · · · , N − t + 1.

Herein, we map a time series to a diﬀusive process and
introduce the DE technique to investigate the time series
of stride interval ﬂuctuations of human gait, which is ob-
tained from healthy subjects who walked for 1 hour at
their normal, slow and fast paces [27]. The data contains
the stride interval ﬂuctuations of ten young healthy men,
given an arbitrary ID (si01, si02, si03, · · · , si10). Partici-
pants have no history of any neuromuscular, respiratory,
or cardiovascular disorders and are taking no medica-
tion. Mean age is 21.7 yr (range 18 − 29 yr). Height is
1.77 ± 0.08(SD)m, and weight is 71.8 ± 10.7(SD)kg. All
the subjects provided informed written consent. Subjects
walked continuously on level ground around an obstacle
free, long (either 225 or 400 meters), approximately oval
path and the stride interval is measured using ultra-thin,
force sensitive switches taped inside one shoe. A typical
example is shown in Fig. 1.

The stride interval signiﬁcantly decreased and the ve-
locity signiﬁcantly increased with each chosen walking
rate, as expected. The mean stride intervals of the three
subjects are 1.3 ± 0.2s, 1.1 ± 0.1s, and 1.0 ± 0.1s during
the slow, normal, fast walking trials, respectively. And
the mean velocities are 1.0 ± 0.2m/s, 1.4 ± 0.1m/s, and
1.7 ± 0.1m/s during the slow, normal, and fast walking,
respectively. The mean velocity increases by an average
of 77% from slow to fast walking. A wide range of walk-
ing rates are obtained, enable us to test for the eﬀects
of walking rate on the scaling behavior indicating the
long-range correlations.

The locomotor control system maintains the stride in-
terval at an almost constant level throughout the 1 hour
walking. Nevertheless, the stride interval ﬂuctuations is
in a highly complex, seemingly random fashion. In order
to truly uncover the scaling behavior of the stride interval
ﬂuctuation of human gait, we study all the 30 samples

of the slow subject (see Fig.2C), the scale-invariant ex-
ponents δ is around 0.821 ± 0.011 (range 0.663 to 0.955).
Thus for all subjects at all rates, the stride interval time
series displayed scaling behavior and long-range power
law correlations.

There are a strong similarity of δ on chosen walking
rate: δ is 0.829±0.011, 0.827±0.011, 0.809±0.013 during
the fast-, normal-, slow-walking trails, respectively (see
Fig. 3). In principle, the estimation of δ depends on the

However, due to the ﬁnite size of data, a larger t2 may
lead to a bigger error in δ [28].
In this paper, all the
results are obtained by linear ﬁtting within the region

The scaling behaviors of the three classes of subjects,
obtained by using DE analysis, are shown in Fig. 2A, 2B
and 2C, respectively. Each ﬁgure contains 10 samples,
of which the time scale is from 10 to 300. The results
indicate that the stride interval time series is not com-
pletely random (uncorrelated), instead, it exhibits the
scale-invariance property and long-range correlation at
all the three walking rates.

Furthermore, Fig. 3 illustrates the dependence of δ on
self-determined walking rate for all three subjects. For

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, by means of the DE method we inves-
tigate the scaling behavior embedded in the time se-
ries of stride interval ﬂuctuation. Scale-invariance ex-
ponents of the three subjects are almost the same, being
in the interval of [0.663, 0.955], of which the mean value
is 0.821 ± 0.011. Dynamical analysis of these step-to-step
ﬂuctuations reveals a self-similar pattern: Fluctuation at
one time scale are statistically similar to those at mul-
tiple other time scales, at least over hundreds of steps,
while the healthy subjects walk at their normal rate. The
long-rang correlation is observed during the spontaneous
walking by removal of the drift or trend in the time series.
Thus the above features uncover the fractal dynamics of
spontaneous stride interval are normally intrinsic to the
locomotor system.

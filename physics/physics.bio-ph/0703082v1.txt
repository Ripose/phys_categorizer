We investigated how the ﬁniteness of the length of the sequence aﬀects the phase

transition that takes place at DNA melting temperature. For this purpose, we mod-

iﬁed the Transfer Integral method to adapt it to the calculation of both extensive

(partition function, entropy, speciﬁc heat, etc) and non-extensive (order parame-

ter and correlation length) thermodynamic quantities of ﬁnite sequences with open

boundary conditions, and applied the modiﬁed procedure to two diﬀerent dynamical

models. We showed that rounding of the transition clearly takes place when the

length of the sequence is decreased. We also performed a ﬁnite-size scaling analysis

of the two models and showed that the singular part of the free energy can indeed

be expressed in terms of an homogeneous function. However, both the correlation

length ξ and the average separation between paired bases hyi diverge at the melting

transition, so that it is no longer clear to which of these two quantities the length

L of the system should be compared. Moreover, Josephson’s identity is satisﬁed for

none of the investigated models, so that the derivation of the characteristic expo-

nents which appear, for example, in the expression of the speciﬁc heat, requires some

care.

INTRODUCTION

2

Real systems manifesting critical behavior have necessarily ﬁnite volume. However it is

well-known that the ﬁniteness of the system size lets the critical singularities disappear and

smears out the phase transition (see for example [1-5]). The obvious argument which may

reconcile these two aspects is that, as the ﬁnite size of the system is increased and passes

through a critical value which characterizes the border of the thermodynamical domain,

the thermodynamical limit is approximately reached and consequently the critical singu-

larities manifest themselves. Thus it is crucial to thoroughly understand the evolution of

singularities with respect to the system size and estimate the critical size above which the

thermodynamical limit is attained.

An eﬃcient tool to analyze the volume dependence of a critical phenomenon is the ﬁnite

size scaling theory. Besides providing information on the rounding of critical singularities

and the shift in the critical point, this theory is also an alternative way to determine critical

exponents characterizing the phase transition.

Finite size scaling theory was developed by Fisher and Barber in the early seventies [6].

During the last thirty years it has been applied to various systems exhibiting both ﬁrst

and second order phase transitions. Among hundreds of subjects we can mention the study

of ﬁnite size eﬀects at ﬁrst order transitions by gaussian approximation [7-8], the Gibbs

ensemble [9], ﬁve dimensional Ising model [10-11], percolation models [12-13], stochastic

sandpiles [14], six-dimensional Ising system [15], Baxter-Wu model [16], two dimensional

anisotropic Heisenberg model [17]...

In nature, the majority of phase transitions are sharp and discontinuous ﬁrst order tran-

sitions. Experimental UV absorption spectra of diluted DNA solutions reveal that the DNA

melting transition belongs to this class. A widely used dynamical non-linear DNA model

was proposed twenty years ago by Peyrard and Bishop [18]. This model involving harmonic

interaction terms between successive base pairs was later improved by the contribution of

Dauxois [19] and the new model (DPB model) yields a sharp transition. We recently pro-

posed an alternative DNA model (JB model) which respects the ﬁniteness of the stacking

energy, and showed that this model also exhibits a sharp ﬁrst order phase transition [20].

Then in [21] we showed that for both models the generalized homogeneity assumption is not

respected so that Josephson’s identity (also known as the hyperscaling relation) is not valid.

We tentatively explained this fact by the divergence of the order parameter at the critical

point.

The goal of this article is to investigate the sequence length dependence of the DNA melt-

ing transition. This is an important point since experiments dealing with DNA molecules

are carried out with various sequence lengths. To this end we employ a modiﬁed transfer

integral method adapted to ﬁnite chains with open boundary conditions. The two hamilto-

nian DNA models to be studied, i.e. the DPB and the JB models, are brieﬂy described in

Sec. II. Section III deals with the transfer matrix theory for ﬁnite linear chains and Sec. IV

is devoted to the ﬁnite size scaling analysis which leads to a better understanding of ﬁnite

size eﬀects.

II. NON-LINEAR HAMILTONIAN MODELS FOR DNA

The Hamiltonians of the two DNA models whose critical behaviour is studied in this

article are of the form

N

H =

p2
n
2m

n=1 (cid:26)
X

+ VM (yn) + W (yn, yn−1)

(cid:27)

where yn is the transverse stretching of the hydrogen bond between the nth pair of bases,

while the one-particle Morse potential term

VM (yn) = D

1 − e−ayn

2

(cid:0)
models the binding energy of the same hydrogen bond. The choice of the nearest-neighbor

(cid:1)

interaction potential W (yn, yn−1) is crucial since the type of the transition, which is a collec-

tive eﬀect, depends primarily on its form. The DPB model [19] assumes that the stacking

energy is of the form

W (yn, yn−1) =

(yn − yn−1)2

1 + ρe−α(yn+yn−1)

.

(3)

K

This non-linear stacking interaction has the particularity of having a coupling constant which

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

drops from K(1 + ρ) to K as the critical point is approached. This decreases the rigidity of

the DNA chain close to the dissociation and yields a sharp, ﬁrst-order transition.

4

This interaction potential still has the inconvenience that the stacking energy diverges

when two paired bases separate. Taking into account the ﬁniteness of the interaction between

adjacent bases, we proposed a potential of the form [20]

W (yn, yn−1) =

+ Kb(yn − yn−1)2

(4)

∆H

which, contrary to the model (3), depends only on the distance between base pairs. The

small harmonic term, whose constant Kb is 2000 times smaller than the parameter K of the

DPB model, was introduced in order to take into account the stiﬀness of the phosphate-sugar

backbone.

III. TRANSFER INTEGRAL METHOD FOR FINITE CHAINS WITH OPEN

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

A. The partition function and extensive thermodynamic quantitites

Let us deﬁne the Transfer Integral (TI) kernel according to

K(yn, yn−1) = exp [−β {VM (yn)/2 + VM (yn−1)/2 + W (yn, yn−1)}]

(5)

where β = (kBT )−1 is the inverse temperature. In the following analysis we deal only with

sequences having open boundary conditions. Then the partition function of the system can

be expressed as

Z

satisfy

Z =

dy1 dy2 · · · dyN e−βVM (y1)/2K (y2, y1) K (y3, y2) · · · K (yN , yN −1) e−βVM (yN )/2.

(6)

The TI method consists in expanding the kernel of Eq. (5) in an orthonormal basis

i
X
where the {Φi} and {λi} are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the integral operator and

K (yn, yn−1) =

λiΦi(yn)Φi(yn−1)

(7)

5

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

dx K(x, y) Φi(x) = λiΦi(y) .

Z

This integral equation was solved by diagonalizing the symmetric TI operator K(x, y) on a

regularly spaced grid deﬁned between ymin = −200/a and ymax = 4000/a with 1/a intervals.

Numerical integrations were performed on the same grid.

In this study we extended the transfer matrix approach for open chains developed in [22]

to adapt it to the calculation of the order parameter hyi and the correlation length ξ. Let

us ﬁrst consider extensive thermodynamic quantities. By introducing

and by substituting the kernel expansion of Eq. (7) into Eq. (6), we get

ai =

dye−βVM (y)/2Φi(y)

Z

Determination of the partition function then allows the computation of extensive quantities

of the system such as the free energy, the entropy and the speciﬁc heat :

CV = −T

In the thermodynamical limit N → ∞ the major contribution to the partition function

arises from the largest eigenvalue λ1 and in this limit it is reasonable to drop the eigenvalues

with i ≥ 2. Neverthless, we will consider large DNA molecules as well as small ones.

Consequently as many eigenvalues as possible must be taken into account in numerical

computations. From the practical point of view, it was found that considering the ﬁrst 400

eigenvalues is enough to insure numerical convergence of the results presented below.

B. The order parameter and the correlation length

The order parameter of DNA melting transition is the mean separation of the bases

averaged over the sites of the sequence :

Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (13) and deﬁning

IV. FINITE-SIZE EFFECTS NEAR THE CRITICAL POINT

A. Rounding of the melting transition of DNA

It is well known that a ﬁnite-size system does not exhibit any phase transition. At the

critical point its free energy is analytic and consequently all thermodynamical quantities are

regular. Let L be the size of a system having a critical behaviour in the thermodynamical
limit L → ∞. For this system ﬁnite-size eﬀects manifest themselves as e−L/ξ, where ξ is the

correlation length, by rounding the critical point singularity. In other words they become

important over a region for which ξ ∼ L. A simple example of this rounding phenomena

concerning the Ising model can be found in [8]. For an inﬁnite-size Ising system, as the

magnetic ﬁeld H varies, the order parameter jumps discontinuously from −Mcr to +Mcr at

the critical point H = 0. On the other hand if the system’s size is ﬁnite, this transition occurs
LLd/(kBT )

on a ﬁnite region of order ∆H ≃ kBT /(McrLd) with a large but ﬁnite slope ∼ M 2

where ML is the most probable value of the magnetization in the ﬁnite system.

For the two DNA models sketched in Sect. 2, the size L of the system is equal to the

number N of base pairs in the sequence times the distance between two successive base

pairs. This latter quantity playing no role in the dynamics of the investigated models, we

will henceforth use indistinctly N or L to refer to the size of the sequence.

Given a sequence of length N, the ﬁrst task consists in determining its critical tempera-

ture, which we denote by Tc(N). Among the several methods listed for example in [25], we

found it rather simple and convenient to search for the maximum of the speciﬁc heat CV ,

which is more pronounced than that of the correlation length ξ, thus allowing for a more

accurate localization of the temperature. Two observations conﬁrm a posteriori that the

critical temperatures thus obtained are correct. First, the shift in critical temperature is

found to vary as a power of N, as predicted by ﬁnite-size scaling theory (see below). The

top plot of Fig. 1 shows for example that Tc − Tc(N), where Tc stands for Tc(∞), varies as
N −1.00 and N −1.05 for the DPB and JB models, respectively. Note that this scaling is also in

excellent agreement with the semi-empirical formula used by experimentalists to calculate

the melting temperature of ﬁnite sequences. Moreover, as will be seen later (Figs. 3 and

4) the curves for the temperature evolution of CV , ξ, hyi, etc...

for sequences with diﬀer-

ent lengths N all coincide suﬃciently far from the critical temperature when plotted as a

8

function of the reduced temperature

t(N) =

T − Tc(N)
Tc(N)

.

In order to illustrate ﬁnite-size eﬀects acting on DNA melting, we ﬁrst computed the entropy

per base, s = S/N, for an inﬁnite chain and a short DNA sequence for both the DPB and

the JB models. Results are shown in Fig. 2. At the thermodynamic limit, the entropy

s is clearly discontinuous at the critical temperature, as is expected for ﬁrst order phase

transitions. In contrast, smooth curves are observed over the whole temperature range for

the sequence with N = 100. We next computed the speciﬁc heat per base, cV = CV /N,

for increasing sequence length and temperature. The top and bottom plots of Fig. 3 show

the temperature evolution of cV for seven values of N ranging from 100 to inﬁnity for the

DPB and JB models, respectively.

It is seen in this ﬁgure that rounding manifests itself

through a decrease in the maximum of cV as N decreases, but also through the fact that

the sharp rise of cV takes place further and further from the critical temperature, that is,

at increasingly larger values of |t(N)|. This is particularly clear for the DPB model, which

at the thermodynamic limit undergoes a very sharp transition, i.e. a transition that is

noticeable only at very small values of |t| = |t(∞)| [21]. Quite interestingly, examination of

Fig. 3 also indicates that the two models consequently give very comparable results up to

N ≃ 1000, while the narrower nature of the phase transition for the DPB model becomes

apparent for longer sequences.

At this point, it should be emphasized that boundary eﬀects may become important

when the size of the system is small. In order to check whether such boundary eﬀects play a

role in the results presented above, we repeated these computations with periodic boundary

conditions instead of open ones and found that this alters only very little the results for s

and cV down to N = 100. Conclusion is therefore that boundary eﬀects play only a marginal

role down to this size.

Finally, we computed, for the JB model, the temperature evolution of the correlation

length ξ (Eq. (A2)) and the order parameter hyi (Eq. (17)) for increasing values of N.

As the critical temperature is approached, the correlation length ξ of a ﬁnite-size system

is expected to increase according to the power law ξ ∝ tν(N) till it reaches the system’s

dimension L and freezes. This behaviour can be checked in the middle plot of Fig. 1, which

shows the evolution of the maximum of the correlation length (in units of the separation

between successive base pairs) as a function of N : the maximum of ξ is indeed of the same

order of magnitude as N and the curve scales as N 0.97. An exception however occurs for the

last three points with N ≥ 3000 : we will come back later to this point. The bottom plot of

Fig. 4 additionally shows the temperature evolution of ξ for seven values of N ranging from

100 to inﬁnity. One observes just the same rounding eﬀects as for the speciﬁc heat in Fig.

3. This is again the case for the temperature evolution of the order parameter hyi, which

is drawn in the top plot of Fig. 4. This latter plot however displays a remarkable feature,

in the sense that all the curves converge to the same limit at Tc(N). To understand why

this is the case, it must be realized that hyi, the average separation between paired bases,

is the only quantity which diverges at the critical temperature whatever the size N of the

sequence, while, for example, cV and ξ diverge for inﬁnitely long chains but remain ﬁnite

for ﬁnite chains. The limit towards which all curves converge in the top plot of Fig. 4 is

thus just the approximation of inﬁnity imposed by the numerical procedure (size of the grid,

etc...).

B. Finite-size scaling analysis

The basic idea of ﬁnite-size scaling is that the correlation length ξ is the only length

that matters close to the critical temperature and that one just needs to compare the linear

dimension L of the system to ξ : rounding and shifting indeed set in as soon as L/ξ ∼ 1 .
Since, by deﬁnition of the critical exponent ν, ξ grows as t−ν, one has (L/ξ) ∝ (tL1/ν)
L → ∞ or, L being proportional to the number N of paired bases, (L/ξ) ∝ (tN 1/ν)

. In the

absence of external ﬁeld, it is therefore natural to write the singular part of the free energy

of the ﬁnite-size system in the form

fsing = N

−d Y (tN 1/ν) .

where Y is some homogeneous function. Diﬀerentiating Eq. (18) twice with respect to t,

one obtains that cV is equal to

cV = N ρG(tN σ) ,

where

and G is an homogeneous function which is proportional to the second derivative of Y . By
using Josephson’s identity, 2 − α = νd, where α is the critical exponent for cV (cV ∝ t−α),

coeﬃcients ρ and σ can be recast in the form

Conversely, if there occur several lengths that diverge at the critical point, as is the case for

DNA melting, then it is no longer so clear to which of these lengths L should be compared.

In order to tackle this more complex case, Binder et al [24] derived a method which is based

on the use of an irrelevant variable u and an expression of the form

fsing = N −dF (tN yt, uN yu)

After several approximations and a little bit of algebra, these authors obtain cV in the form

of Eq. (19) with, however,

Finally, the lengths that diverge at DNA melting are ξ and hyi, the average separation

between paired bases. One might wonder whether L should not be compared to hyi instead

of ξ. In order to check this hypothesis, let us denote by λ the characteristic exponent for

hyi (hyi ∝ tλ). Remember that if the external ﬁeld is proportional to y then hyi is the order

parameter m, so that λ is equal to β, the critical exponent for m (m ∝ tβ). Let us next

express the singular part of the free energy in the form

Table I shows the values of ρ and σ calculated from the characteristic exponents reported

in [21] and Eqs (20), (21), (23) and (25), as well as adjusted values. These latter ones were

obtained by varying ρ and σ by hand in order that the plots of cV /N ρ as a function of
tN σ are superposed for an interval of values of N as large as possible. By setting t = 0 in

Eq. (19), one sees that the maximum of cV scales as N ρ. ρ was therefore adjusted in the

neighbourhood of the slope of the plot of the maximum of cV as a function of N (bottom plot

of Fig. 1). On the other hand, σ was adjusted in the neighbourhood of 1/ν. Examination

of Table I indicates that the values of ρ and σ obtained from Eqs. (20) and (25) compare

well with the adjusted ones, while this is certainly not the case for the values obtained from

Eqs. (21) and (23). Figs. 5 and 6 further show plots of cV /N ρ as a function of tN σ for,

respectively, the DPB and JB models, and values of ρ and σ obtained from Eq. (21) (top

plots) and adjusted ones (bottom plots). It is seen in the top plots that the curves with

diﬀerent values of N are far from being superposed for the values of ρ and σ obtained from

Eq. (21), and the situation is still worse with Eq. (23). In contrast, the various curves

are fairly well superposed for the adjusted values of ρ and σ (see bottom plots of Figs 5

and 6), as well as those obtained with Eqs. (20) and (25). An exception occurs for the

curves corresponding to the largest values of N in the JB model (bottom plot of Fig. 6).

Remember that the corresponding points also depart from the power law in the bottom

plot of Fig. 1. The reason for this is that the TI method fails to give correct values of

thermodynamical observables too close to the phase transition discontinuity. Examination

of the top plots of Fig. 3 shows that sequences of length N = 10000 are still rather far

from the thermodynamic limit for the DPB model, so that one needs not to worry about

the eﬀect of the discontinuity on TI calculations. In contrast, the bottom plot of Fig. 3

and the two plots of Fig. 4 indicate that sequences of length N = 10000 have reached the

thermodynamic limit for the JB model, so that the perturbative eﬀect of the discontinuity

becomes noticeable in TI calculations.

12

The fact that Eq. (20) leads to a correct superposition of the curves for diﬀerent values

of the sequence length N is the proof that the basic hypothesis of ﬁnite-size scaling theory

is satisﬁed. Since, however, Eq. (25) also leads to a correct superposition of the curves, it

is, as expected, no longer clear to which diverging length (ξ or hyi) L should be compared,

both possibilities leading to a reasonable result. On the other hand, the fact that curves

with diﬀerent N are no longer superposed when Eq. (21) is used to calculate ρ and σ simply

reﬂects the fact that Josephson’s identity, 2 − α = νd, is not valid for these two models of

DNA melting, a conclusion which was already arrived at in our preceding work [21]. Finally,

the fact that curves also do not superpose when Eq. (23) is used indicates that one of the

several hypotheses made by the authors of Ref.

[24] to arrive to these expressions is not

satisﬁed for the DNA models, although it is not an easy task to tell which one(s) is(are)

invalidated. Alternatively, Eq. (23) can be straightforwardly derived from Eq. (20) by using

Rushbrooke identity (α + 2β + γ = 2) as well as Josephson’s one. This latter identity being

not valid, it comes as no surprise that Eq. (23) leads to as poor a result as Eq. (21).

V. CONCLUSION

To summarize, we modiﬁed the Transfer Integral method to adapt it to the calculation of

thermodynamic quantities of ﬁnite sequences with open boundary conditions. Non-extensive

quantities, like the average separation of paired bases hyi and the correlation length ξ, turned

out to be the most tricky ones to evaluate. We then applied this modiﬁed procedure to the

DPB and JB dynamical models, in order to clarify how the ﬁniteness of the length of

the sequence aﬀects the phase transition that takes place at DNA melting temperature.

We showed that the rounding of the transition that occurs when the size of the sequence

decreases is clearly reﬂected in the temperature evolution of most quantities, including the

speciﬁc heat cV , the correlation length ξ, and the average separation of paired bases hyi.

We next performed a ﬁnite-size scaling analysis of the two systems and showed that the

singular part of the free energy can indeed be expressed in terms of an homogeneous function.

However, since both ξ and hyi diverge at the melting transition, it is no longer clear whether

the argument of the homogeneous function should be (a power of) L/ξ or L/ hyi. Moreover,

Josephson’s identity is satisﬁed for none of the investigated systems, so that the derivation

of the characteristic exponents ρ and σ, which appear in the asymptotic expression of the

speciﬁc heat cV , requires some care.

The Transfer Integral (TI) method appears as the only eﬃcient numerical tool to study

the thermodynamics of DNA melting in detail. In the formulation used here, it however

applies only to homogeneous chains, while it is well established that the heterogeneity of

real DNA molecules may smear out the discontinuity of the melting transition, just like

the ﬁniteness of the sequence does. Our next goal is therefore to overcome the technical

diﬃculty associated with the application of the TI method to inhomogeneous chains and

investigate the eﬀect of heterogeneities on the phase transition at DNA melting.

TABLE CAPTION

17

Table I : Values of the coeﬃcients ρ and σ of Eq. (19) for the DPB and JB models.

First four lines show the values calculated from the characteristic exponents reported in Ref.

[21] and Eqs (20), (21), (23) and (25). The last line shows the values adjusted by hand in

order that the plots of cV /N ρ as a function of tN σ are superposed on an interval of values

of N as large as possible (see bottom plots of Figs. 5 and 6).

FIGURE CAPTIONS

Figure 1 : (color online) Log-log plots, as a function of the sequence length N, of

the reduced critical temperature shift 1 − Tc(N)/Tc(∞) (top plot), the maximum of the

correlation length ξ (middle plot), and the maximum of cV (bottom plot), according to

the DPB (squares) and JB (circles) models. ξ is in units of the separation between two

successive base pairs, and cV in units of kB. The solid and dash-dotted lines show the result

of the adjustment of power laws against the calculated points.

Figure 2 : (color online) Plot of the entropy per site s as a function of the rescaled

temperature t(N) for an inﬁnitely long chain (circles) and a sequence with N = 100 bp

(squares), according to the DPB model (top plot) and the JB one (bottom plot). s is in

units of kB .

Figure 3 : (color online) Log-log plots of the speciﬁc heat per site cV as a function of

the opposite −t(N) of the rescaled temperature for the DPB model (top plot) and the JB

one (bottom plot) and seven values of the sequence length N ranging from 100 to ∞. cV is

in units of kB. Note that, at the thermodynamic limit of inﬁnitely long chains, cV becomes

inﬁnite at the critical temperature but numerical limitations of the TI method prevent the

observation of such divergence.

Figure 4 : (color online) Log-log plots of the correlation length ξ (bottom plot) and

the order parameter hyi (top plot) as a function of the opposite −t(N) of the rescaled

temperature for the JB model and seven values of the sequence length N ranging from 100

to ∞. ξ is in units of the separation between two successive base pairs and hyi in units of

the inverse 1/a of the Morse potential parameter. Although numerical limitations of the

TI method prevent the observation of such divergences, ξ becomes inﬁnite at the critical

temperature at the thermodynamic limit of inﬁnitely long chains, while hyi becomes inﬁnite

at the critical temperature whatever the length N of the sequence.

Figure 5 : (color online) Plots, for six values of the sequence length N ranging from 100

to 10000, of cV /N ρ as a function of tN σ for the DPB model and values of ρ and σ obtained

from Eq. (21) (top plot) or adjusted by hand (bottom plot).

Figure 6 : (color online) Plots, for six values of the sequence length N ranging from 100

to 10000, of cV /N ρ as a function of tN σ for the JB model and values of ρ and σ obtained

from Eq. (21) (top plot) or adjusted by hand (bottom plot).

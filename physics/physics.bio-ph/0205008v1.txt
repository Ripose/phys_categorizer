Molecular gyroscopes and biological effects of weak ELF magnetic ﬁelds

Extremely-low-frequency magnetic ﬁelds are known to affect biological systems. In many cases, biological
effects display ‘windows’ in biologically effective parameters of the magnetic ﬁelds: most dramatic is the fact
that relatively intense magnetic ﬁelds sometimes do not cause appreciable effect, while smaller ﬁelds of the
order of 10–100 µT do. Linear resonant physical processes do not explain frequency windows in this case.
Amplitude window phenomena suggest a nonlinear physical mechanism. Such a nonlinear mechanism has
been proposed recently to explain those ‘windows’. It considers quantum-interference effects on protein-bound
substrate ions. Magnetic ﬁelds cause an interference of ion quantum states and change the probability of ion-
protein dissociation. This ion-interference mechanism predicts speciﬁc magnetic-ﬁeld frequency and amplitude
windows within which biological effects occur. It agrees with a lot of experiments. However, according to
the mechanism, the lifetime Γ−1 of ion quantum states within a protein cavity should be of unrealistic value,
more than 0.01 s for frequency band 10–100 Hz. In this paper, a biophysical mechanism has been proposed that
(i) retains the attractive features of the ion interference mechanism, i.e., predicts physical characteristics that
might be experimentally examined and (ii) uses the principles of gyroscopic motion and removes the necessity
to postulate large lifetimes. The mechanism considers dynamics of the density matrix of the molecular groups,
which are attached to the walls of protein cavities by two covalent bonds, i.e., molecular gyroscopes. Numerical
computations have shown almost free rotations of the molecular gyros. The relaxation time due to van der Waals
forces was about 0.01 s for the cavity size of 28 angstr¨oms.

INTRODUCTION

Weak static and extremely-low-frequency (ELF) magnetic
ﬁelds (MFs) can affect living things: cells, tissues, physiolog-
ical systems, and whole organisms [1, 2, 3]. In many cases bi-
ological effects of weak MF feature resonance-like multipeak
behavior. Multipeak responses or magnetobiological spectra
may appear with varying the frequency or amplitude of AC
MF [4] and the magnitude of DC MF [5]. Usually, the term
‘windows’ is used for the peaks of the spectra.

Amplitude ‘windows’, see Fig. 1, specify nonlinearity of
the transduction mechanisms involved in magnetobiological
effects. This is conﬁrmed more by the fact that magnetic
noise simultaneously superimposed on a regular magnetic sig-
nal suppresses biological effect of that signal [6, 7, 8, 9].

A nonlinear mechanism based on quantum interference
has been developed in [10] to explain unusual ELF MF fre-
quency and amplitude dependencies of magnetobiological ef-
fects (MBEs). The mechanism elaborates the interference of
ions bound within proteins. According to this mechanism, su-
perposition of the ion states forms a non-uniform pattern of
the probability density of ion. This pattern consists of a row
of more or less dense segments occurring due to the inter-
ference between quantum states of ions in a protein binding
cavity. In a DC MF the pattern rotates with the cyclotron fre-
quency. Exposure to a time-varying MF of speciﬁc parameters
retards the rotation of the pattern and facilitates escape of the

ion from the cavity. This escape might inﬂuence equilibrium
of biochemical reactions to ultimately result in a biological
effect.

Biologically effective parameters of AC-DC magnetic
ﬁelds depend on the charge-to-mass ratio of the ion in ques-
tion. The closed formula is derived for ‘magnetic’ part P of
ion-protein dissociation probability. Predictions based on this
formula reveal good agreement with experimental results in-
volving calcium, magnesium, potassium, hydrogen and other
ions of as molecular targets for MF. The theory describes mul-
tipeak frequency and amplitude spectra of MBEs involving
ions of Ca2+, Mg2+, and H+ as molecular targets for AC-DC
MFs [10].

The interference mechanism is surprisingly effective in ret-
rospectively predicting results of existing experiments con-
ducted under the following deﬁned MF conditions: parallel
AC-DC and pulsed MFs [10, 11], ‘null’ and static MFs [13],
and various MFs with a slow rotation of a biological system
[12]. As an example, Fig. 1 demonstrates the comparison of
experimental data, in parallel AC-DC MFs, on MBEs involv-
ing ﬁxed and rotating proteins, and calculated curve (dash
line).

The good consistency between theoretical calculations and
many experiments indicates that what underlies magnetobio-
logical effects is most likely an interference phenomenon.

According to the interference mechanism,

the relation
should be valid Γ−1Ωc & 1, where Γ−1 is the lifetime of
ion quantum states within a bound cavity and Ωc is a cy-
clotron frequency of an ion in the geomagnetic ﬁeld, usually
10–100 Hz. The postulate therefore has to be made that ion
quantum states, more exactly their angular modes, live more
than 0.01 s within the cavity. However it is in contradic-
tion with our common knowledge that such states might live

only 10−12–10−10 s because of the thermalizing interaction of
ion with cavity walls. On the other hand, the weak AC MF,
~Ωc ≪
kBT , is commonly believed to be unable to contribute
into thermally driven (bio)chemical reactions (so-called kT-
problem).

To overcome the problem, we note that there is a speciﬁc
mechanism that provides relatively large lifetime of the an-
gular modes. Consider a dipole molecular group that are at-
tached within the cavity to its walls in two points, i.e. by two
covalent bonds, thus forming a group that may rotate inside
the cavity without contact with walls. Such a construction is
referred to as gyroscope. In the case, it is a molecular gy-
roscope. Of importance is the fact that thermal oscillations
of that covalent bonds, or gyroscope’s supports, make only
zero torque about the axis of rotation. This leads to rela-
tively slow thermalization of a gyroscopic degree of freedom.
Relaxation is mainly due to van der Waals interaction with
thermalizing walls. As far as the interaction potential, the
Lennard–Jones potential, decreases as r−6 and walls’ inner
surface grows as r2, the overall van der Waals contribution
varies approximately as r−4. That is, relaxation quickly di-
minishes with the cavity size to grow. Computations show

almost free rotations (thermalization time 0.01 s) of a molecu-
lar gyro within the cavity of 28 angstr¨oms size. This is enough
for the ion interference mechanism to display itself. Probably,
such roomy cavities are formed by ensembles of a few protein
globules, between them, or within some enzymes that unfold
DNA double-helix.

II. MOLECULAR GYROSCOPE

A long lifetime of angular modes is the sole serious ideal-
ization underlying the mechanism of ion interference. This
idealization would be hard to substantiate with the ion-in-
protein-capsule model. One would have to assume that the
ion forms bound states of the polaron type with capsule walls.
In turn, justiﬁcation of a large lifetime of polaron angular
modes would require new idealizations. A ‘vicious circle’
occurs which one could not leave without having to substan-
tially change the model itself. Thus, despite the obvious ad-
vantages of the ion-in-capsule model, namely, simplicity and
a high forecasting skill, we have to recognize its limitations
and seek for other solutions.

where L is the angular momentum, K is the sum of torques

rotating around one of its main axes of inertia with a force F
acting on its point of support, as shown in Fig. 2. The moment
of this force about the shown axis is obviously zero. From

F, i.e., the force caused an orthog-

directed along the axis of rotation, therefore the vector dL is
also orthogonal with L0.

Thus, a continuously acting force F causes a forced preces-
sion of the gyro about the direction F with an angular velocity
deﬁned by the angle through which the gyro axis of rotation
deviates per unit time, viz.,

The length of vector r is deﬁned by the gyro locking condi-

pends on the gyro parameters. For estimation, it is important
that r has the order of magnitude of gyro length.

.

Let the gyro be a model of a rigid molecule free to move
and constrained by the thermal oscillations of one of the point
of support (e.g. A) alone. We estimate the mean gyro axis
deviation angle for a random force F causing chaotic oscilla-
tions of its point of support. It should be noted that the gyro
M gR is many orders of magnitude below its
gravity energy

As can be seen deviations increase with the size of molecule;
however, even for small molecules, the estimate of deviation
is unrealistically large. It implies that, in lower rotation states,
molecules will ‘lay aside’ in response to perturbation of their
support and, consequently, the angular momentum will not
be conserved. It should be noted that we are interested only in
angular states with small quantum numbers. Otherwise the in-
terference patterns to be discussed below become ﬁne grained
and are unlikely to be reﬂected in measured properties.

Thus, in order to be immune to thermal displacements of
supports, the gyro has to have its second support also ﬁxed in
the protein matrix. The conﬁguration of a rotating solid with
supports ﬁxed in the rim is one of the types of a gyroscope,
i.e., a device to measure angular displacements and velocities.
What we consider is essentially a molecular gyro: a relatively
large molecular group is placed in a protein cavity and its two
edges form covalent bonds (supports) with the cavity walls. It
is important to note that thermal oscillations of the supports
produce only zero moments of forces about the natural group
rotation axis. Therefore, the gyroscopic degree of freedom ϕ
is not thermalized by the supports’ oscillations. This does not
imply that the energy of the gyro does not dissipate. Radiation
damping or Lorentz friction force is neglected, because of its
inﬁnitesimal value. Below we examine at ﬁrst the interference
of the molecular gyro and then the damping due to wan der
Waals forces.

distributed over the molecule in a magnetic ﬁeld leads to interference
of its quantum angular states.

INTERFERENCE OF THE MOLECULAR

GYROSCOPE

Rotations of large molecules is much slower a process than
electron and oscillatory processes. Therefore, we think of the
rotating molecular group as a rigid system of charged point
masses — atoms and molecules with partially polarized chem-
ical bonds. To illustrate, we point to molecules of amino
acids which could be built into rather spacious protein cavi-
ties forming chemical bonds at extreme ends of the molecule,
thus forming a molecular gyroscope. Amino acids are links
of polymeric protein macromolecules and also occur in a bio-
plasm as free monomers. The general formula of amino acids
is well known:

where R is a radical which differs one molecule from another.
Polarities of the groups are shown in a water solution. By way
of example, the radical of amino glutaric acid consists of three
links
COOH, as shown in Fig. 3. Fixed on
either side of a cavity, such a molecule, treated as a dynamic
unit, has one degree of freedom — a polar angle ϕ, which
simpliﬁes analysis of its behavior in a magnetic ﬁeld.

The probability of biochemical reaction that we examine here

that gyro that non-linearly depends on σ(α)

Then, as in the ion interference model, we assume the reaction
probability of a side group of the rotating molecule with the
protein active site to be a non-linear function of the probability
density (14). In the absence of whatever information on that
function, it makes sense to consider quadratic non-linearity,
since the linear term makes no contribution to that probability,
see details in [10]. To ﬁnd the reaction probability we will
square (14) and take the average over the gyro ensemble.

In the product pτ (t)pτ (t) there are (i) complex conjugate

obviously, are more than order of value smaller, in the case of
ωg & Γ, i.e., when it makes sense to examine the interference
in general. Thus, in order to make approximate assessments
we omit the terms with n > 1. Then, for the same reason, for
the ground state m = 0 only contributions of the terms with

As is seen, the magnitude of the magnetic effect depends on
the ratio of the density matrix elements at the initial moment

This function is shown in the Fig. 1, solid line. We conclude
that the positions of the maxima of the amplitude spectrum of
the magnetic effect do not depend (and the relative magnitude
of the effect do) on the distribution of the initial populations
of the gyro levels.

The spectrum (17) determines only possible locations of ex-
trema. A real form of the spectrum depends on the initial con-
ditions for the density matrix, i.e., on the populations of levels
of different rotational quantum number m.

It is instructive to note that the molecule need not have
i qiri for the magnetic effect to appear.
a dipole moment
Rather, it is important that the ‘charge moment of inertia’ Q

P

(10) be other than zero. This can be the case in the absence of
dipole moment, e.g. for ionic rather than zwitterionic form of
the molecule.

The main properties of the gyro interference are identical
with those of the ion interference, namely, (i) multiple peaks
in the amplitude and frequency spectra, (ii) dependence of the
positions of frequency peaks on the DC MF intensity, and (iii)
independence of the positions of amplitude maxima on the AC
MF frequency.

We note that the interference of a molecular gyro has some
features that differ it from the ion interference. Firstly, the
peak frequencies are deﬁned with respect to the gyral fre-
quency ωg — a rotation equivalent of cyclotron frequency.
Peak frequencies depend on the distribution of electric charges
over the molecule and may deviate from harmonics and sub-
harmonics of the cyclotron frequency. Secondly, the gyro
rotation axis is ﬁxed with respect to the shell, which intro-
duces, in the general case, one more averaging parameter in
the model. However, these features are not of principal signif-
icance. The speciﬁc properties of the interference can always
be calculated for any conﬁguration of magnetic and electric
ﬁelds, for rotation of biological systems and macromolecules
involved, etc.

There is the crucial feature of the gyro interference: molec-
ular gyros are relatively immune to thermal shaking and may
be effective biophysical targets for external MFs.

As is seen from (16) the absolute magnitude of the mag-
netic effect, where the latter is maximized by the MF param-
eters, depends mainly on the value η = Γτ , which should be
minimized for greater effects. The protein reaction time τ and
the MF frequency Ω have to fulﬁll the relation Ωτ & 1 in or-
der to manifest an interference. This and the properties of the
function sinh2 η/η2 lead to the condition of observability

IV. ESTIMATING RELAXATION TIME FROM
MOLECULAR DYNAMICS

Computer simulation of molecular gyro behavior indicates
that, for relaxation times of order 0.01 s, the size of cavity
should be below 30 ˚A.

We consider the amino acid residue Phenilalanin, (Phe)
CαC6H5, as a gyro and look at the revolution of its benzene
ring C6H5 about the valence bond Cα—Cβ — see Fig. 4. This
revolution may be thought of as a rotation in one plane of two
rigidly bound point masses m = 26 mp (mp is the mass of
proton), spaced by a = 2.42 ˚A from one another, about their
common center of gravity.

We model the cavity by four heavy particles of mass M
≥
m placed in the corners of a square (diagonal b > a) centered
on the gyro axis, as shown in Fig. 5. We assume that these
particles oscillate in the gyro rotation plane xy. Each particle
moves in the potential well U (xi, yi), where xi, yi is the de-
viation of particle i from its equilibrium state. The Hamilton

Thus, at time zero, the molecular gyro is not thermalized.

Our objective is to estimate the average time of gyro ther-
malization. It corresponds to the relaxation time of gyro rota-
tion in a thermalized molecular system. For this purpose, we
numerically integrate the equations of motion (21) subject to
the initial condition (22).

We will assume that the molecular subsystem is completely
thermalized if its current temperature exceeds 0.99T . We
determine the gyro thermalization time t1 as a solution of
the equation T1(t) = 0.99T , and the time of heavy parti-
cle system thermalization t2, as a solution of the equation
T2(t) = 0.99T . The gyro is thermalized by interacting with
the system of heavy particles, therefore its thermalization time
will depend on the diameter b of the heavy particle system and
will always exceed the heavy particle system thermalization
time (t1 > t2). Time t2 is almost independent of b and is
dependent only on the relaxation time tr: t2 ≈
We analyzed the behavior of the system for R0 = 1 ˚A,
∞
and M = m, 100m. The dependence of gyro thermalization
time t1 on cavity diameter b is shown in Fig. 7. It is evident
that, whatever the values of R0 and M , the thermalization
time increases exponentially with b. If we extrapolate this de-
pendence to the range of large b, we see that, at b = 28–32 ˚A,
the thermalization time, and hence the gyro relaxation time
Γ−1, will be of the order of seconds. With this size of cavity,
the molecular gyro will revolve almost freely.

V. CONCLUSION

The molecular interfering gyroscope is a challenger for
solving the kT-problem as a probable mechanism of magneto-
biological effects. Indeed, the walls of a protein cavity do not
interfere with the gyro degree of freedom directly via short-
range chemical bonds. For cavities larger than 30 ˚A in size,
the contribution to the relaxation from the van der Waals elec-
tromagnetic forces, induced by wall oscillations, is small. Ra-
diation damping is negligibly small. Finally, the oscillations
of gyro supports produce a zero moment of forces about the
axis of rotation and do not affect the angular momentum. The
gyro degree of freedom is very slow to thermalize, its dynamic

10

behavior is coherent, which gives rise to slow interference ef-
fects. Of course, whether or not some more or less water-free
cavities of the size of 30 ˚A and larger do exist remains an open
question, but, what is essential, ELF magnetic ﬁeld bioeffects
are no longer a paradox.

The role of molecular gyros could probably be played by
short sections of polypeptides and nucleic acids built inside
globular proteins or in cavities between associated globules.
In this respect it is interesting to look at Watson–Crick pairs of
nitrous bases (adenine–thymine and guanine–cytosine) which
bind DNA strands into a double helix as well as some other
hydrogen-bound complexes of nitrous bases. Their rotations
are hampered by steric factors. However, in the realm of activ-
ity of special DNA enzymes, steric constraints may be lifted
to allow a relatively free rotation of molecular complexes. It is

not yet clear whether or not the gyro type of molecular struc-
tures exists. They are unlikely to be detected by X-ray meth-
ods since these require crystallization of proteins for structural
analysis.
In this state, the rotation would likely be frozen.
Should a rotation be allowed, the mobile groups would not
give clear cut reﬂections. Some other methods are needed that
would work with native forms of proteins avoiding distortions
due to crystallization.

Generally speaking, the fact that the molecular gyro model
gives a physically consistent explanation of MBEs proves in-
directly its real grounds. Further studies should verify whether
this conclusion is correct. In any case, today, the interfering
molecular gyroscope is a single available mechanism to give
explanations that would be physically transparent and gener-
ally agreeable with experiments.

Abstract

This paper develops a theory for characterisation of DNA sequences based on their
measure representation. The measures are shown to be random cascades generated by
an inﬁnitely divisible distribution. This probability distribution is uniquely determined
by the exponent function in the multifractal theory of random cascades. Curve ﬁtting
to a large number of complete genomes of bacteria indicates that the Gamma density
function provides an excellent ﬁt to the exponent function, and hence to the probability
distribution of the complete genomes.

1 Introduction

DNA sequences are of fundamental importance in understanding living organisms, since
all information on their hereditary evolution is contained in these macromolecules. One of
the challenges of DNA sequence analysis is to determine the patterns of these sequences. It is
useful to distinguish coding from noncoding sequences. Problems related to the classiﬁcation
and evolution of organisms using DNA sequences are also important.

Fractal analysis has proved useful in revealing complex patterns in natural objects.
Berthelsen et al.
[2] considered the global fractal dimension of human DNA sequences
treated as pseudorandom walks. Vieira [3] carried out a low-frequency analysis of the com-
plete DNA of 13 microbial genomes and showed that their fractal behaviour does not always
prevail through the entire chain and the autocorrelation functions have a rich variety of
behaviours including the presence of anti-persistence. Provata and Almirantis [14] proposed

a fractal Cantor pattern of DNA. They mapped coding segments to ﬁlled regions and non-
coding segments to empty regions of a random Cantor set and then calculated the fractal
dimension of this set. They found that the coding/noncoding partition in DNA sequences of
lower organisms is homogeneous-like, while in the higher eucariotes the partition is fractal.
Yu and Anh [16] proposed a time series model based on the global structure of the complete
genome and found that one can get more information from this model than that of fractal
Cantor pattern. Some results on the classiﬁcation and evolution relationship of bacteria were
found in [16]. The correlation property of length sequences was discussed in [17].

Although statistical analysis performed directly on DNA sequences has yielded some
success, there has been some indication that this method is not powerful enough to amplify
the diﬀerence between a DNA sequence and a random sequence as well as to distinguish DNA
sequences themselves in more details. One needs more powerful global and visual methods.
For this purpose, Hao et al. [7] proposed a visualisation method based on coarse-graining
and counting of the frequency of appearance and strings of a given length. They called it the
portrait of an organism. They found that there exist some fractal patterns in the portraits
which are induced by avoiding and under-represented strings. The fractal dimension of the
limit set of portraits was discussed in [18, 8]. There are other graphical methods of sequence
patterns, such as chaos game representation (see [10, 5]).

In the portrait representation, Hao et al.

[7] used squares to represent substrings and
discrete colour grades to represent the frequencies of the substrings in the complete genome.
It is diﬃcult to know the accurate value of the frequencies of the substrings from the portrait
representation. And they did not discuss the classiﬁcation and evolution problem. In order
to improve it, Yu et al [15] used subintervals in one-dimensional space to represent substrings
to obtain an accurate histogram of the substrings in the complete genome. The histogram,
viewed as a probability measure and was called the measure representation of the complete
genome, gives a precise compression of the genome. Multifractal analysis was then proposed
in Yu et al [15] to treat the classiﬁcation and evolution problem based on the measure
representation of diﬀerent organisms.

In this paper, we go one step further and provide a complete characterisation of the
DNA sequences based on their measure representation. This is given in the form of the
probability density function of the measure. We ﬁrst show that the given measure is in fact
a multiplicative cascade generated by an inﬁnitely divisible distribution. This probability
distribution is uniquely determined by the exponent K (q) , q ≥ 0, in the multifractal analysis
of the cascade. This theory will be detailed in the next section. We then apply the theory
on a large number of typical genomes.
It will be seen that the Gamma density function
provides an excellent ﬁt to the K (q) curve of each genome. This characterisation therefore
provides a needed tool to study the evolution of organisms.

2 Measure representation of complete genome

We ﬁrst outline the method of Yu et al [15] in deriving the measure representation of a
DNA sequence. Such a sequence is formed by four diﬀerent nucleotides, namely adenine (a),
cytosine (c), guanine (g) and thymine (t). We call any string made of K letters from the
set {g, c, a, t} a K-string. For a given K there are in total 4K diﬀerent K-strings. In order
to count the number of each kind of K-strings in a given DNA sequence, 4K counters are
needed. We divide the interval [0, 1[ into 4K disjoint subintervals, and use each subinterval
to represent a counter. Letting s = s1 · · · sK, si ∈ {a, c, g, t}, i = 1, · · · , K, be a substring
with length K, we deﬁne

where

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

We then use the subinterval [xl(s), xr(s)) to represent substring s. Let N(s) be the times
of substring s appearing in the complete genome. If the number of bases in the complete
genome is L, we deﬁne

F (s) = N(s)/(L − K + 1)

(2.4)

to be the frequency of substring s.
measure µK on [0, 1) by

It follows that

{s} F (s) = 1. Now we can deﬁne a

P

µK (dx) = YK (x) dx,

YK(x) = 4KFK(s),

x ∈ [xl(s), xr(s)).

(2.5)

We then have µK ([0, 1)) = 1 and µK ([xl(s), xr(s))) = FK(s). We call µK (x) the measure
representation of an organism. As an example, the measure representation of M. genitalium
for K = 3, ..., 8 is given in Figure 1. Self-similarity is apparent in the measures.

More than 33 bacterial complete genomes are now available in public databases. There
are six Archaebacteria (Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Pyrococcus abyssi, Methanococcus jannaschii,
Pyrococcus horikoshii, Aeropyrum pernix and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum); ﬁve

3

Gram-positive Eubacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycoplasma
genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Bacillus subtilis). The others are Gram-negative
Eubacteria, which consist of two Hyperthermophilic bacteria (Aquifex aeolicus and Ther-
motoga maritima); ﬁve Chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatisserovar, Chlamydia muridarum,
Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae AR39); two Spirochaete (Borrelia burgdor-
feri and Treponema pallidum); one Cyanobacterium (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803); and
thirteen Proteobacteria. The thirteen Proteobacteria are divided into four subdivisions,
which are alpha subdivision (Rhizobium sp. NGR234 and Rickettsia prowazekii); gamma
subdivision (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Xylella fastidiosa, Vibrio cholerae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Buchnera sp. APS); beta subdivision (Neisseria meningi-
tidis MC58 and Neisseria meningitidis Z2491); epsilon subdivision (Helicobacter pylori J99,
Helicobacter pylori 26695 and Campylobacter jejuni). The complete sequences of some chro-
mosomes of higher organisms are also currently available. We selected the sequences of
Chromosome 15 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Chromosome 3 of Plasmodium falciparum,
Chromosome 1 of Caenorhabditis elegans, Chromosome 2 of Arabidopsis thaliana and Chro-
mosome 22 of Homo sapiens.

In our previous work (Yu et al [15]), we calculated the numerical dimension spectra Dq
(deﬁned in next section) for all above organisms and for diﬀerent K. For small K, there are
only a few diﬀerent K-strings, so there is not enough information for any clear-cut result.
We ﬁnd that the Dq curves are very close to one another for K = 6, 7, 8 for each organism.
Hence it would be appropriate to take K = 8 if we want to use the Dq curves to discuss
the classiﬁcation and evolution problem. It is still needed to know what is the analytical
expression of the dimension spectra. The main aim of this paper is to establish a theoretical
model to give such an analytical expression.

3 Multifractal models

Let ε (t) be a positive stationary stochastic process on a bounded interval of R, assumed
to be the unit interval [0, 1] for convenience, with Eε (t) = 1. The smoothing of ε (t) at scale
r > 0 is deﬁned as

For 0 < r < u < v, we consider the processes

Following Novikov [13], we assume the following scale invariance conditions:

(i) The random variables Xr,u and Xu,v are independent;

(ii) The probability distribution of each random variable Xu,v depends only on the ratio

u/v of the corresponding scales.

4

These conditions imply the power-law form for the moments of the processes Xu,v if they

exist. In fact, we may write

from condition (ii) for some function g which also depends on q. From the identity

Since u is arbitrary, we then have

(cid:17)

by Schwarz’s inequality and v/r > 1, we get K ′′ (q) ≥ 0, that is, K (q) is a convex function.
It is noted that equality holds in (3.5) only if K (q) is a linear function of q; other than this,
K (q) is a strictly convex function.

For 0 < q < 1, we assume that K (q) < 0, which reﬂects the fact that, in this range,
taking a qth-power necessarily reduces the singularity of Xu,v. Also, we assume that the
probability density function of Xu,v is skewed in the positive direction. This yields that
K (q) > 0 for q > 1. These assumptions, in conjunction with the strict convexity of K (q) ,
suggest the assumption that

K (1) = 0.

In this paper, we will consider smoothing at discrete scales rj = 2−j+1, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

Then the smoothed process at scale rj is

Xj (t) = εrj (t) =

ε (s) ds.

Under the condition Eε (t) = 1, it is reasonable to assume that

XJ (t) = X0 (t)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

Under the scale invariance conditions (i) and (ii), the random variables Xj/Xj−1 of (3.10) are
independent and have the same probability distribution. Let W denote a generic member of
this family. Note that EW = 1 from (3.7). Then (3.10) can be rewritten as

XJ (t) = XJ−1 (t)

XJ (t)
XJ−1 (t)

= W1 (t) W2 (t) ...WJ (t) , t ∈ [0, 1] .

(3.11)

In other words, XJ (t) is a multiplicative cascade process (see Holley and Waymire [9], Gupta
and Waymire [6]). Denote by µJ the sequence of random measures deﬁned by the density
XJ (t) , that is,

µJ (dt) = XJ (t) dt, J = 1, 2, 3, ...

It can be checked that µJ a.s. has a weak* limit µ∞ since for each bounded continuous func-
[0,1] f dµJ is an L1-bounded martingale (see Holley and Waymire
tion f on [0, 1] , the sequence
[9], Mandelbrot [12], Kahane and Peyriere [11]). We denote the density corresponding to µ∞
R
by X∞ (t) . Then it is seen from (3.8) that

X∞ (t) = ε (t) , t ∈ [0, 1] .

(3.12)

Summarising, we have established that

The positive stationary process ε (t) is the limit of a

multiplicative cascade with generator W .

In other words, the Carleman condition is satisﬁed (see Feller [4], p. 224). As a result, we
get

T he probability density function fW of the generator W is
uniquely determined by the set {K (q) , q = 0, 1, 2, ...} .

It is seen that, if the function K (q) has analytic continuation into the complex plane,

then the characteristic function of ln W has the form

ψ (x) = (ψn (x))n .

Thus ψ (x) is inﬁnitely divisible (see Feller [4], p. 532); in other words,

ln W has an inﬁnitely divisible distribution.

As constrained by (3.6), the following condition must be satisﬁed by the measure P (ds) :

Equations (3.19) and (3.20) provide the most general form for the K (q) curve of the positive
random process {ε (t) , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1} .

In practice, ﬁtting this K (q) curve to data requires a proper choice of the measure P (ds) .

Novikov [13] suggests the use of the Gamma density function, namely,

where P (dx) = f (x) dx and A, α, σ are positive constants. From (3.19) and (3.21) we get

f (x) = Axα−1 exp (−x/σ) ,

that the data for the K (q) curve is provided by

where it should be noted from (3.12) that X∞ (t) = ε (t) , the given positive random process.
Since each smoothed process XJ may possess long-range dependence (see Anh et al. [1]),
the ergodic theorem may not hold for these processes. As a result, the computation of
E (X q
J ) as sample averages may not be suﬃciently accurate. There is an alternative form
of the ergodic theorem developed by Holley and Waymire [9] for random cascades which we
now summarise.

τ (q) = −χb (q) .

(3.28)

In our case as developed above, b = 2, and (3.13) gives W ≤ 2. In fact the scale rj = 2−j+1
used in (3.8) is arbitrary; it can be b−j+1 and the inequality W ≤ b still holds by deﬁnition

4 Data ﬁtting and discussion

For K = 8, we ﬁrst calculated K(q) of the measure representation of all the above
organisms directly from the deﬁnition of K(q) (3.23). Figure 2 shows how to calculate this
K(q) curve. We give the K(q) curves of E. coli, S. cerevisiae Chr15, C. elegans Chr1, A.
thaliana Chr2, and Homo sapiens Chr22 in Figure 3. From Figure 3, it is seen that the
grade of the organism is lower when the Kq curve is ﬂatter. Hence the evolution relationship
of these organisms is apparent. We denote by Kd(q) the value of K(q) computed from the
data using its deﬁnition (3.23) and deﬁne

error =

|κ(qj −

(qjσ + 1)1−α − 1
(σ + 1)1−α − 1

) − Kd(qj)|2.

J

Xj=1

Then the values of κ, σ and α can be estimated through minimising error. In this minimi-
sation, we assume

0 ≤ κ, σ, α ≤ 20.

After obtaining the value of κ, σ and α, we then get the K(q) curve from (3.22). The
data ﬁtting based on the form (3.22) was performed on all the organisms and shown in
Table 1 (from top to bottom, in the increasing order of the value of κ). It is found that
the form (3.22) gives a perfect ﬁt to the data for all bacteria. As an example, we give the
data ﬁtting of E. coli, S. cerevisiae Chr15 and C. elegans Chr1 in Figure 4. But for higher
organisms, for example, Homo sapiens Chromosome 22, the ﬁtting is not as good. Note
that we only selected one chromosome for each higher organism. If all chromosomes for each
higher organism are considered, the data ﬁtting for Kq will be better. The ﬁt for Human
Chromosome is the worst in Table 1. Since the length of Human Chromosome 22 is not
larger than those of the complete genomes of all bacteria, there does not seem to be any
relationship between the quality of ﬁt and the length of the complete genome.

The parameter κ provides a tool to classify bacteria. From Table 1, one can see He-
licobacter pylori 26695 and Helicobacter pylori J99 group together, and three Chlamydia
almost group together. But this parameter κ alone is not suﬃcient, it must be combined
with other tools to classify bacteria.

We also calculated the values of τ (q) using its deﬁnition (3.25). We found the values of
Kd(q) coincide with those obtained from (3.29). Hence we indeed can use (3.29) to calculate
K(q). Formula (3.22) gives an analytical expression for the quantity Kq. An analytical
expressions for τ (q) can therefore be obtained from (3.29) and Dq from (3.26).

5 Conclusions

The idea of our measure representation is similar to the portrait method proposed by Hao
et al.[7]. It provides a simple yet powerful visualisation method to amplify the diﬀerence
between a DNA sequence and a random sequence as well as to distinguish DNA sequences

10

themselves in more details. From our measure representation we can exactly know the
frequencies of all the K-string appearing in the complete genome. But the representations
alone are not suﬃcient to discuss the classiﬁcation and evolution problem. Hence we need
further tools.

In our previous work (Yu et al [15]), when the measure representations of organisms were
viewed as time series, it was found that they are far from being random time series, and in
fact exhibit strong long-range dependence. Multifractal analysis of the complete genomes
was performed in relation to the problem of classiﬁcation and evolution of organisms. In
this paper, we established a theoretical model of the probability distribution of the complete
genomes. This probability distribution, particularly the resulting K(q) curve, provides a
precise tool for their characterisation. Numerical results conﬁrm the accuracy of the method
of this paper.

For a completely random sequence based on the alphabet {a, c, g, t}, we have Dq =
1, τ (q) = q − 1, K(q) = 0 for all q. From the K(q) curves, it is seen that all complete
genomes selected are far from being a completely random sequence.

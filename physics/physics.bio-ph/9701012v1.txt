Abstract

We present a Hamiltonian approach for the wellknown Eigen model of the

Darwin selection dynamics. Hamiltonization is carried out by means of the

embedding of the population variable space, describing behavior of the sys-

tem, into the space of doubled dimension by introducing additional dynamic

variables. Besides the study of the formalism, we try to interpret its basic

elements (phase space, Hamiltonian, geometry of solutions) in terms of the

theoretical biology. A geometric treatment is given for the considered system

dynamics in terms of the geodesic ﬂows in the Euclidean space where the

population variables serve as curvilinear coordinates.

The evolution of the distribution function is found for arbitrary distributed

initial values of the population variables.

I. INTRODUCTION

Methods of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian analysis are extensively applied

during last decades in various ﬁelds of theoretical and mathematical physics.

These methods, however, have not been widely used until now in mathemat-

ical theory of biological and ecological systems which foundations originated

from the works of the 10-30-es by A. Lotka, V. Volterra, J. Haldane and R.

Fisher.

The basic obstacle, by our view, is that the mathematical models of bi-

ological subjects, being open systems in their essence, are not supposed to

be Hamiltonian ones from the outset. On the other hand, broad potential-

ities may appear for biological systems to analyze some aspects (of both

principle and technical character) of their dynamics, if the system admits

Hamiltonization in a sense.

In the present paper we suggest a Hamiltonian form for the wellknown

Eigen model of the Darwin selection dynamics. To construct the Hamiltonian

formalism, we extent the space of population variables introducing additional

degrees of freedom. As a result the behavior of the system is described in

terms of the space with doubled dimension if compared to the original one.

Besides the study of the formalism, we try to interpret its basic elements

(phase space, Hamiltonian, geometry of solutions) in terms of the theoretical

biology. A geometric treatment is given for the considered system dynamics

in terms of the geodesic ﬂows in the Euclidean space where the population

2

variables serve as curvilinear coordinates.

The notion of a Darwin system (DS) as a formal object in theoretical

biology had been introduced by M. Eigen to deduce laws of living system

evolution from the principles of theoretical physics and chemistry.

By deﬁnition, the DS is an open system, which is constituted of coupling

units of diﬀerent species (genotypes) self-copying with a small number of er-

rors (convariantly self-reduplicating according to Timofeev-Resovskii nomen-

clature [1]). The coupling units utilize a substance and free energy of an

external nutrient supply [2].

The Darwin selection phenomenon occurs in such systems under the fol-

lowing necessary conditions: the stability of system organization (i.e. the

total quantity of units of all species should conserve) or the stability of feed

component inﬂux. Both of these constraints imply the ﬂow through the

system. A simple experimental model of the DS (chemostat, turbidostat,

etc.) can be a system where viruses and bacteria are deﬁned as convariantly

self-reduplicating units (see, for example, [3]).

The following system of diﬀerential equations proposed by M. Eigen to

describe the DS evolution:

˙xi = xi(AiQi − Di) +

wjixj − Φi,

(1)

here i, j, k = 1, . . . , N ; N is a species quantity of self-reduplicating units

(genotypes) in the system; xi is a speciﬁc quantity (concentration) of the i-th

species; Ai (Di) is a speciﬁc reproduction (death) velocity of the i-th species;

N

Xj6=i

3

Qi is a parameter of the reduplication quality of the i-th species (takes the

values from 0 to 1); wji is a speciﬁc velocity of the error reduplication of

the j−th species into the i−th one; Φi is a dilution parameter which usually

equals to Dxi. Here D is a dilution ﬂow rate.

Further, as it has been shown by M. Eigen [2], the system (1) can be put

in a simpler form

˙yi = yi(µi(S) − D)

(2)

using obvious relations between Ai, Qi, wji and by introducing new pop-

ulation variables (yi), being related to the so called ”quasispecies” which

are described by certain combinations of original variables (xi). Here

i, j, k = 1, . . . , N ; N is a (constant) quasispecies quantity in the system; yi

has a meaning of a speciﬁc quantity (concentration) of the i-th quasispecies;

S = (S1, . . . , Sf ) are the concentrations of the external nutrient supply com-

ponents; µi(S) is a generalized Maltuzian parameter which has a meaning of

the reproduction speciﬁc velocity of the i-th quasispecies and depends on S.

The µi(S) is an algebraic combination of all Ak, Dk, wjk in which Ai makes

a major contribution. The µi(S), D have dimension of inverse time. The

”quasispecies” introduced by M. Eigen as new population variables have a

clear biological sense of clones, systems of organisms with a prevalence of

the determined genotype in the system and small admixtures of some other

genotypes connected with the leading one by the mutation and recombination

transitions [2].

4

There are two commonly recognized types of DS under the constraints

imposed above on the system (1). Recall the deﬁnitions of these types.

Deﬁnition I.1 A Darwin system is referred to as DS with stable organiza-

tion (DSSO) if

N
i=1 yi and S are constant. A Darwin system with D = const

P

is referred to as DS with a stable ﬂow (DSSF).

It is known that the representation of the system (2) in terms of relative vari-

ables having a meaning of shares (probabilities) of the quantities [4] trans-

forms (2) into the classical form of the Fisher system of equations which

describes the Darwin selection dynamics in the panmictic populations under

the special requirement for the ﬁtness function [5]. The system (2) is also

valid for description of interspecies competition for the grow-determining

substrate when there is no migration. In view of signiﬁcance of the systems

(1),(2) in biology and ecology they are investigated in a large number of

works since the paper [5] has appeared. So we touch upon some of these

publications relevant for the present paper.

An exact solution of (2) is known only for µi = const [6], a general form

of approximate solution is found by Jones [7] for the µi changing in time.

A general review of the properties of system (2) in the Fisher modiﬁcation

is given in [8], [9]. Stability of the stationary solutions of (2) is analyzed

in detail by Pykh [10]. Feistel and Ebeling have studied behavior of the

Eigen-Fisher system on the adaptive Right’s landscape and shown that in

a number of cases the system can be represented in the canonical gradient

5

form [4], [11]. Isida [12] investigated non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the

systems described by the Eigen equations. As is known, there are two dif-

ferent approaches to describe Darwin, Fisher and reducible to them Volterra

systems by means of extremal principles. The ﬁrst (teleological) approach

assumes to extremalize of a functional having a certain biological sense as

a ﬁnite aim of the evolution. For example, it might be maximum of an av-

erage population ﬁtness [5], or maximum of an average productivity [2], or

maximum of a reproductive potential [8] etc. The second approach assumes

to achieve the extremum of some function of dynamic variables in each mo-

ment of time. Thus, in reference [13] it is shown that the requirement for

Kulback’s measure to have a maximum value leads to the relations which are

the solutions of (2) under the special conditions imposed on the system in

the approximation of the DSSO. As a next example we refer to the work [9]

where variational form of the Eigen-Fisher dynamics in a special case is built

up by introduction of a metrics of a Riemann space. Despite the fact that

the dynamics of the Eigen-Fisher type systems are managed to represent in

the form of extremal principles in some special cases, the problem stays far

from complete solution as it has been explained in [8].

The Hamiltonian form of the DS dynamic equations, being proposed in

the present work, leads to the conventional variational principle, which is

habitual in mechanics.

II. DS WITH A STABLE ORGANIZATION

In accordance with def.I.1, Eqs. (2) assume the following form for the

DSSO case:

˙yi = yi 


µi −

N

Xj=1

yjµj (cid:30)

N

Xj=1

yj 


, µi = const.

(3)

The dimensionless variables pi = yi/

N
j=1 yj have a meaning of shares (prob-

abilities) of the quantities. Taking into account that

N
j=1 yj = const, we

P

derive from (2) for pi the equations:

If pN is eliminated solving the constraint

N
j=1 pj = 1, one can rewrite (4)

P

as follows:

˙pi = pi(µi −

pjµj).

˙pi = pi(ai −

pjaj).

(4)

(5)

Here and up to the end of this section we assume: i, j, k = 1, . . . , N − 1, ai =

µi − µN , µN is a Maltuzian parameter of N -th quasispecies taken as a gauge

one, for example, by the criterium of minimal value of µi. Next, to simplify

(5) we introduce the following variables:

zi = log[pi/(1 −

pj)].

(6)

N −1

Xj=1

Accounting the condition 1 −

N −1
j=1 pj = pN , the new variables zi might

P

be called as informational ones, inasmuch as they reﬂect, in a spirit of the

Shannon’s theory [14], a quantity of information for every independent degree

of freedom co-ordinated to the eliminated N -th variable.

Consider variables (6) as coordinates of a manifold A which naturally can

be named as an information one. A state of the system in A is characterized

by a point z = (z1, z2, . . . , zN −1). The system dynamics z(t) is described by a

velocity vector ˙z(t). The system (5) in the variables z takes the simple form,

and has the general solution

˙zi = ai,

zi(t) = zi0 + ait.

Hence, evolution of the DSSO in the ”information” variables (6) is a uniform

rectilinear motion. Taking ”mass” to be a unit, we can conceive that the ai

is the i-th component of the momentum. In accordance with Hamiltonian

formalism, we will interpret (zi) and (ai) as the position and momentum

variables, respectively, in a 2(N − 1)−dimensional phase space M of the

system. Introducing Hamiltonian of the system

we can write down the Hamiltonian form of the system (7) as follows:

(7)

(8)

(9)

In the framework of the considered Hamiltonian approach we can state the

following variational principle for the DSSO dynamics. Lagrange function

of the system (9), l =

eliminating, takes the form:

The minimal action principle is:

The variational principle (10),(11) leads to the following treatment of the DS

dynamics:

a DSSO evolutes in the information manifold A in such a way which minimal-

izes the squared norm of the respective velocity of variation of information

in the system at the considered time interval.

Canonical form of the dynamic equations (5) is found from the canonical

transformation (zi, ai) → (pi, ri), where ri are additional variables canonically

conjugate to pi. This transformation is:

The respective dynamics can be represented in terms of the geodesic ﬂows

symbols.

Let us point out that the coordinates pi are nonorthogonal ones due to

nondiagonality of the metrics in these coordinates.

The DS trajectories pi(t) are usually mapped as curved lines in the coor-

dinates pi supposing them to be orthogonal Cartesian ones (see, for example,

11

[2]), whereas this motion can be represented as straight lines in the Cartesian

coordinates zi. Twisting of the trajectory with respect to (pi) is the result of

the curvilinearity of these coordinates. The existence of the coordinates (zi),

where the DSSO dynamics is represented by a uniform rectilinear motion,

illustrates the absence of a coupling between quasispecies and any external

factors in the course of the Darwin selection process. From this standpoint,

the DSSO can serve as a biology-theoretic analogue of an inertial reference

system in the Newtonian mechanics.

Let us note that the ai give rise to an Abelian algebra of integrals of the

system (14) which is integrable by Liouville with respect to the conventional

Poisson brackets {f, g} =

N −1
j=1 (∂f /∂pj∂g/∂rj− ∂g/∂pj∂f /∂rj). The system

pi(α) = pi(0)V (α)−1,

i 6= q;

rq(α) = e−αV (α)2[rq(0) + W (eα − 1)V (α)−1];

ri(α) = ri(0)V (α),

i 6= q.

Here V (α) ≡ 1 + (eα − 1)pq(0), W ≡

j6=q rj(0)pj(0), pi(0), ri(0) are initial

conditions for (22). Let us note, that the variables pi in (23) transform

independently of ri so that one can directly use (23) for the original system

P

(22)

(5).

In conclusion of this section we consider DSSO dynamics with less num-

ber of constraints then in the def.I.1. Let us retire only the requirement of

constant of total quantity of all species in the system and remove the restric-

tions on the nutrient supply concentration and on some other parameters of

the medium, for example, on a temperature. This leads for µi to be certain

functions of time. Since µi are not involved in the transformation from the

original variables to the ”information” ones, Hamiltonian form of the DS

dynamics can be thereby constructed in the considered case too.

Let fi be the ﬁrst derivative of ai, ˙ai = fi. Since ai serve as momentum

variables in the DS dynamics, then the derivatives of fi can be considered

as components of a force.

It is easy to show that the Hamiltonian of the

considered system takes the form:

Respectively, Hamiltonian form of Eqs. (9) is:

The Hamiltonian (24) plays a role of an ”energy” in the Darwin dynamics

if functions fi are constant in time. The second term in (24) has a sense of

a ”potential energy”. The DS dynamics described by the system (25) is a

motion in the ﬁeld of the ”force” fi. The additional ”potential” term leads

to the variational principle (10),(11) with the modiﬁed Lagrangian:

III. DS WITH A STABLE FLOW

To provide Eqs. (1) to be a complete system in the case of DSSF (in the

sense of def.I.1), one has to deﬁne explicitly the functions µi(S) and to extend

the system introducing equations for S. Here and further i, j, k = 1, . . . , N .

The wellknown Monod function [15] is commonly recognized for DSs. It

depends on one independent variable S which has a meaning of concentration

of the substrate being in physiological minimum (growth limiting substrate).

That is the concentration vector S is reduced to one component S. The

dynamic system in this case takes the form:

˙yi = yi(µi(S) − D),

˙S = D(S0 − S) −

P
µi = miS/(Ki + S),

N
j=1 yjµj,

(27)

where mi is a maximal reproduction speciﬁc velocity, Ki is a saturation

parameter of i-th quasispecies, mi, Ki = const, S is a concentration of the

growth limiting substrate in the system, S0 is its concentration in the external

ﬂow.

There is no apparent way to solve the system (27) and to hamiltonize it

under arbitrary values of parameters.

For the further analysis of this system let us take into account some qual-

itative peculiarities of its dynamics which are known from experimental data

14

and numerical simulations [16], [17].

The system dynamics in general case is characterized by two basic sta-

dium:

the ﬁrst one is an initial transient with a period of order 2/D ÷ 4/D where

the function S(t) varies strongly and nonlinearly;

the second one is a quasistationary behavior in the interval 4/D < t < τ

where τ is an observation time of the system. S(t) can be approximated in

this case by a linear function in this range up to 3-7%. Let

S(t) = ¯S + b(t −

τ ).

1
2

Here ¯S is an average value of the S(t) during the observation time τ of the

system, b is an average velocity of the concentration variation of the rate-

determining substrate in the system.

Moreover, µi(S) can be also approximated by a linear function in the range

of the quasistationary behavior where S(t) < Ki.

Expanding Monod function (27) in a neighborhood of the point S = ¯S,

we have in the second order:

µi(S) = ˜αi + ˜βiS,

˜αi = µi( ¯S) − ¯S(∂µi( ¯S)/∂ ¯S) = mi ¯S2/(Ki + ¯S)2,

˜βi = ∂µi( ¯S)/∂ ¯S = miKi/(Ki + ¯S)2.

With the approximations above, the DSSF dynamics in the quasistation-

ary stadium is described by the following equations:

˙yi = yi(αi + βi · t),

(28)

15

where αi = ˜αi + ˜βi( ¯S − 1

2bτ ) − D, βi =b · ˜βi. It is easily to give a Hamiltonian

form for the system (28). Choosing canonical variables in a 2N −dimensional

phase space as

and the Hamiltonian

we arrive to the Hamiltonian form of Eqs. (28):

zi = log yi,

ai = αi + βi · t

tively. The Lagrange function, l =

IV. DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION OF INITIAL DATA FOR DS

Hamiltonian form of the DS dynamics allows one to investigate evolu-

tion of an initial data distribution. Consider this problem for the DSSO

case in more detail. Let initial data for the DSSO are given in a domain

O of phase space M with a distribution function f0(p, r), f0(p, r) ≥ 0,

O f0(p, r)dpdr = 1. The problem of initial data indeterminancy arises for
R
the Darwin systems due to natural restrictions on the exactness of measure-

ments and Poisson character of initial values distribution of separate geno-

types quantity. Consider the evolution of the distribution function f (t, p, r)

under the condition that

f (t, p, r)|t=0 = f0(p, r).

(34)

Supposing that the randomness is brought in the DS behavior only in the

form of random distribution of initial data and further DS evolution is de-

termined and is subjected to the Hamiltonian equations above, we deduce

that the distribution remains constant on the phase trajectories on account

of conservative character of the Hamiltonian dynamics. In other words, the

distribution function f (t, p, r) obeys the Liouville equation:

∂f
∂t

+ {f, h} = 0.

(35)

The solution of (35) with the initial condition (34) is obtained by substitution

of the expressions p0(t, p, r), r0(t, p, r) inverting formulas (15), (16) into the

initial function f0:

18

f (t, p, r) = f0(p0(t, p, r), r0(t, p, r)).

(36)

As an illustration let us consider more speciﬁcally the simplest case of phase

space N = 2 when a point of phase space M is deﬁned by one coordinate

(p) and one momentum (r) variables. In this case p0(t, p, r), r0(t, p, r) are

written down in the form:

1
2

p0(t, p, r) =

[1 − tanh(t · θ + δ)],

r0(t, p, r) = 8θ cosh2(t · θ + δ),

where θ = 1

2rp(1 − p), δ = 1

2 log

(1 − p)
p

.

f (t, p, r) = f0(

[1 − tanh(t · θ + δ)], 8θ cosh2(t · θ + δ)).

Eq. (37) allows one to obtain time-dependent distribution function of p:

f (t, p) =

f (t, p, r)dr.

Evolution of the distribution function can be inferred from the transformation

of equiprobabilistic surfaces which are obtained from equation f (t, p, r) =

const in diﬀerent moments of time t.

Similar results can be easily obtained in the case of DSSF. Evolution of

the distribution function is given by (36) in which it is necessary to substitute

the equations y0(t, y, r), r0(t, y, r) inverting (33).

Hamiltonian form of the dynamic equations describing Darwin selection

process, being demonstrated here by the simple examples of the DSs, leads

V. CONCLUSION

19

to an interesting, by our opinion, aspects of the dynamics. For example, DS

can be investigated in the framework of near-integrable Hamiltonian systems

with more complicated functions µi, D then studied in the present work.

It is pertinent to note that in the present work the phase space M includes

original information space A. Such way of Hamiltonization seems to be more

preferable if compare to one proposed in [18] for the Volterra-Lotka type

systems where phase space is built up from the original variables.

In the

latter case a number of constraints are imposed on the system that restricts

the generality.

Abstract

Various symmetries connected with purine-pyrimidine content of
DNA sequences are studied in terms of the intruduced determinative
degree, a new characteristics of nucleotide which is connected with
codon usage. A numerological explanation of CG pressure is pro-
posed. A classiﬁcation of DNA sequences is given. Calculations with
real sequences show that purine-pyrimidine symmetry increases with
growing of organization. A new small parameter which characterizes
the purine-pyrimidine symmetry breaking is proposed for the DNA
theory.

Abstract investigation of the genetic code is a powerful tool in DNA mod-
els construction and understanding of genes organization and expression [1].
In this direction the study of symmetries [2, 3], application of group theory [4]
and implication of supersymmetry [5] are the most promising and necessary
for further elaboration. In this paper we consider symmetries connected with
purine-pyrimidine content of DNA sequences in terms of the determinative
degree introduced in [6].

We denote a triplet of nucleotides by xyz, where x, y, z = C, T, A, G.
Then redundancy means that an amino acid is fully determined by ﬁrst two
nucleotides x and y independently of third z [1]. Sixteen possible doublets xy
group in 2 octets by ability of amino acid determination [7]. Eight doublets
have more “strength” in sense of the fact that they simply encode amino
acid independently of third bases, other eight (“weak”) doublets for which
third bases determines content of codons.
In general, transition from the
“powerful” octet to the “weak” octet can be obtained by the exchange [7]
⇐⇒ T, which we name “star operation (∗)” and call purine-
C
pyrimidine inversion. Thus, if in addition we take into account GC pressure
in evolution [8] and third place preferences during codon-anticodon pairing
[9], then 4 nucleotides can be arranged in descending order in the following
way:

⇐⇒ A, G

∗

∗

Pyrimidine

Purine Pyrimidine

Purine

C

G

T

A

very “strong” “strong”

“weak”

very “weak”

(1)

Now we introduce a numerical characteristics of the empirical “strength”
— determinative degree dx of nucleotide x and make transition from qualita-
tive to quantitative description of genetic code structure [6]. It is seen from
(1) that the determinative degree of nucleotide can take value dx = 1, 2, 3, 4
in correspondence of increasing “strength”. If we denote determinative de-
gree as upper index for nucleotide, then four bases (1) can be presented

as vector-row V = (cid:0) C(4) G(3) T(2) A(1) (cid:1). Then the exterior product

M = V × V represents the doublet matrix M and corresponding rhombic
code [10], and the triple exterior product K = V × V × V corresponds to
the cubic matrix model of the genetic code which were described in terms
of the determinative degree in [6]. To calculate the determinative degree of
doublets xy we use the following additivity assumption

dxy = dx + dy,

(2)

2

which holds for triplets and for any nucleotide sequence. Then each of 64
elements (codons) of the cubic matrix K will have a novel number character-
istics —determinative degree of codon dxyz = dcodon = dx + dy + dz which
takes value in the range 3 ÷ 12. We can also deﬁne the determinative degree

of amino acid dAA as mean arithmetic value dAA = P dcodon/ndeg, where ndeg

is its degeneracy (redundancy). That can allow us to analyze new abstract
amino acid properties in connection with known biological properties [6].

Let us consider a numerical description of an idealized DNA sequence
as a double-helix of two codon strands connected by complementary condi-
tions [1]. Each strand is described by four numbers (nC, nG, nT, nA) and
(mC, mG, mT, mA), where nx is a number of nucleotide x in one strand. In
terms of nx and mx the complementary conditions are

nC = mG, mC = nG, nT = mA, mT = nA.

(3)

The Chargaﬀ’s rules [1] for a double-helix DNA sequence sound as: 1)
total quantity of purines and pyrimidines are equal NA + NG = NC + NT;
2) total quantity of adenine and cystosine equal to total quantity of guanine
and thymine NA + NC = NT + NG; 3) total quantity of adenine equal to
total quantity of thymine NA = NT and total quantity of cystosine equal to
total quantity of guanine NC = NG; 4) the ratio of guanine and cystosine to
adenine and thymine v = (NA + NT) / (NC + NG) is approximately constant
for each species. Usually the Chargaﬀ’s rules are deﬁned through macroscopic
molar parts which are proportional to absolute number of nucleotides in DNA
[1]. If we consider a DNA double-helix sequence, then Nx = nx + mx. In
terms of nx and mx the ﬁrst three Chargaﬀ’s rules lead to the equations which
are obvious identities, if complimentary (3) holds. From fourth Chargaﬀ’s
rule it follows that the speciﬁcity coeﬃcient vnm for two given strands is

vnm =

nA + mA + nT + mT
nC + mC + nG + mG

.

(4)

The complementary (3) leads to the equality of coeﬃcients v of each
strand vnm = vn = vm ≡ v, and v is connected with GC content pCG in the
double-helix DNA as pCG = 1/ (1 + v).

We consider another important coeﬃcient: the ratio of purines and pyrim-
idines k. For two strands from the ﬁrst Chargaﬀ’s rule we obviously derive
knm = 1. But for each strand we have

kn =

nG + nA
nC + nT

, km =

mG + mA
mC + mT

(5)

3

which satisfy the equation knkm = 1 following from complementary.

Let us introduce the determinative degree of each strand exploiting the

additivity assumption (2) as

dn = 4 · nC + 3 · nG + 2 · nT + 1 · nA,
dm = 4 · mC + 3 · mG + 2 · mT + 1 · mA.

(6)
(7)

The values dn and dm can be viewed as characteristics of the empirical
“strength” for strands, i.e. “strand generalization” of (1). Then we deﬁne
summing and diﬀerence “strength” of a double-helix sequence by

d+ = dn + dm, d− = dn − dm.

(8)

The ﬁrst variable d+ can be treated as the summing empirical “strength”
of DNA (or its fragment). Taking into account the complementary conditions
(3) we obtain d+ through one strand variables

d+ = 7 · (nC + nG) + 3 · (nT + nA) .

(9)

We can also present d+ through macroscopically determined variables Nx
as follows d+ = 7 · NC + 3 · NA = 7 · NG + 3 · NT, or through GC and AT

contents as d+ =

7
2

To give sense to the diﬀerence d− we derive

· NC+G +

· NA+T.

2

d− = nC + nT − nG − nA.

(10)

We see that the star operation obviously acts as (d+)∗ = d+ and (d−)∗ =

−d−. From (9)-(10) it follows the main statement:

The biological sense of the determinative degree d is contained

in the following purine-pyrimidine relations:

1) The sum of the determinative degrees of matrix and com-

plementary strands in DNA (or its fragment) equals to

d+ =

7
2

· NC+G +

3
2

· NA+T.

(11)

2) The diﬀerence of the determinative degrees between ma-
trix and complementary strands in DNA (or its fragment) ex-
actly equals to the diﬀerence between pyrimidines and purines
in one strand

4

d− = npyrimidines − npurines,

(12)

where npyrimidines = nC + nT and npurines = nG + nA, or it is
equal to diﬀerence of purines or pyrimidines between strands

d− = npyrimidines − mpyrimidines = mpurines − npurines.

(13)

We can also ﬁnd connection between d+, d− and the coeﬃcients k and v

as follows

d+ =

1
2

NC+G (7 + 3v) = NC+G(cid:18)2 +

3

2 · pCG(cid:19) ,

d− = npyrimidines (1 − kn) .

(14)

(15)

If we consider one species for which v = const (or pCG = const), then
we observe that d+ ∼ NC+G, which can allow us to connect the determi-
native degree with ”second level” of genetic information [8]. From another

7
3

of coeﬃcients in (11) can play a numerological role in CG
side, the ratio
pressure explanations [8], and therefore d+ can be considered as some kind
of “evolutionary strength”.

Now we consider the determinative degree of double-helix sequences in
various extreme cases and classify them. We call a DNA sequence mononu-
cleotide, dinucleotide, trinucleotide or full, if one, two, three or four numbers
nx respectively distinct from zero. Properties of mononucleotide double-helix
DNA sequence are in the Table 1.

The trinucleotide DNA can be listed in the similar, but more cumbersome
way. The full DNA sequences consist of nucleotides of all four types and
described by (9)-(10).

The introduction of the determinative degree allows us to single out a
kind of double-helix DNA sequences which have an additional symmetry.
We call a double-helix sequence purine-pyrimidine symmetric, if

d− = 0,

i.e. its empiric “strength” vanishes. From (10) it follows

i.e. kn = km = 1, which can be rewritten for one strand

nC + nT = nG + nA,

or as equality of purines and pyrimidines in two strands

npyrimidines = npurines

npyrimidines = mpyrimidines,

npurines = mpurines.

The purine-pyrimidine symmetry (17) has two particular cases:

1)

2)

nC = nG,
nT = nA,

nC = nA,
nT = nG,

− symmetric DNA,

− antisymmetric DNA.

(16)

(18)

(20)

(21)

(22)

The ﬁrst case corresponds to the Chargaﬀ’s rule applied to a single strand
which approximately holds for long sequences [11], and so it would be inter-
esting to compare transcription and expression properties of symmetric and
antisymmetric double-helix sequences.

We have made a preliminary analysis of real sequences of several species
taken from GenBank (2000) in terms of the determinative degree. It were
considered 10 complete sequences of E.coli (several genes and full genomic
DNA 9-12 min.), 12 complete sequences of Drosophila melanogaster (crc
genes), 10 complete sequences of Homo sapiens Chromosome 22 (various
clones), 10 complete sequences of Homo sapiens Chromosome 3 (various
clones). We calculated the nucleotide content NC, NT, NG, NA and the de-
terminative degree characteristics d+, d−, q = d−/d+, kn and v for every
sequence. Then we averaged their values for each species. The result is
presented in the Table 3.

First of all we observe that all real sequences have high purine-pyrimidine
symmetry (smallness of parameter q). Also we see that the relation of purines
and pyrimidines in one DNA strand kn is very close to unity, therefore we
have a new small parameter in the DNA theory (kn − 1) (or q), which charac-
terizes the purine-pyrimidine symmetry breaking. This can open possibility
for various approximate and perturbative methods application. Second, we
notice from Table 3 that the purine-pyrimidine symmetry increases in direc-
tion from protozoa to mammalia and is maximal for human chromosome. It
would be worthwhile to provide a thorough study of purine-pyrimidine sym-
metry and codon usage in terms of the introduced determinative degree by
statistical methods, which will be done elsewhere.

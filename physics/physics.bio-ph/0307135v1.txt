How Fast an a Neuron Reat to Transient Stimuli?

In a generi neuron model, we present the linear response theory for the (cid:28)ring rate in response

to both time dependent input urrents and noise amplitudes. In both ases the signal transmission

is strongly attenuated for frequenies above the stationary (cid:28)ring rate. For high frequenies both

the mean input and the noise transmission funtion deay as ω−2

, independent of model details.

Our results indiate that previously suggested mehanisms for near instantaneous transmission of

information are not onsistent with the spike generation mehanism of real neurons.

We would like to onlude this letter with a omparison

of the dynami behavior of the θ-neuron with a biophys-

ial realisti ondutane based neuron [16℄ as well as

with the lassial leaky integrate-and-(cid:28)re (LIF) model.

the θ-neuron it is a onsequene of the dependene of the
eigenvalues on τc , in integrate-and-(cid:28)re models they result

from the voltage threshold.

Figure 4 shows the step response of the three models

In onlusion, we presented the linear response theory

for an idential urrent orrelation, idential initial and

for the (cid:28)ring rate of the θ-neuron in response to both time

(cid:28)nal (cid:28)ring rates and similar membrane potential orrela-

dependent input urrents and time dependent noise am-

tion times. The dynamis of the θ-neuron and the on-

plitudes. For an e(cid:27)etive numerial treatment we derived

dutane based model agree well, their response time is

a sparse matrix representation of the Fokker-Plank op-

about 10ms. The dashed line shows the linear response

erator. Using the eigenvalues and eigenfuntions of this

result, whih predits a slower response but is of the same

operator, we showed that the transmission amplitude is

order of magnitude. The LIF model on the other hand

in both ases strongly damped for frequenies above a

responds pratially instantaneously. This is due to the

ut-o(cid:27) frequeny.

In a wide range of parameters this

fat that in the LIF model high input frequenies are not

ut-o(cid:27) frequeny is always below the mean (cid:28)ring rate.

We showed that the response behavior agrees well with

not deay for large frequenies. This is impossible in the

the dynamis of a ondutane based model neuron and

θ-neuron in whih the response amplitude always deays
as ω−2

. We would like to stress that this deay is a uni-

is di(cid:27)erent from the behavior of the LIF model. Our

results indiate that the θ-neuron, although simple, ap-

versal property due to the insensitivity to input urrents

tures well the dynamial properties of real neurons. They

at the point where a spike is (cid:28)red and is independent

also reveal that previously proposed mehanisms of pra-

of model details. Thus, although one observes that the

tially instantaneous transmission of information are in-

response times of both, the θ-neuron and the LIF model
derease with inreasing τc , the mathematial origin and

ompatible with the spike generating mehanism of real

neurons. Our (cid:28)ndings suggest that the origin of fast sig-

nature of this dependene is very di(cid:27)erent. Whereas in

nal proessing does not reside at the single neuron level.

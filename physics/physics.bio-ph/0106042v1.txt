Abstract

The critical properties of a cellular automaton model describing
the spreading of infection of the Herpes Simplex Virus in corneal tissue
are investigated through the dynamic Monte Carlo method. The model
takes into account diﬀerent cell susceptibilities to the viral infection, as
suggested by experimental ﬁndings. In a two-dimensional square lattice
the sites are associated to two distinct types of cells, namely, permissive
and resistant to the infection. While a permissive cell becomes infected
in the presence of a single infected cell in its neighborhood, a resistant
cell needs to be surrounded by at least R > 1 infected or dead cells
in order to become infected. The infection is followed by the death of
the cells resulting in ulcers whose forms may be dendritic (self-limited
clusters) or amoeboid (percolating clusters) depending on the degree of
resistance R of the resistant cells as well as on the density of permissive
cells in the healthy tissue. We show that a phase transition between
these two regimes occurs only for R ≥ 5 and, in addition, that the
phase-transition is in the universality class of the ordinary percolation.

Introduction

One of the most common and intensively studied diseases among humans is the
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Apparently, the unique symbiosis that exists
in nature between humans and the HSV allows the viral particles to remain inactive
(latent infection) in the cranial nerve ganglia after a primary infection, producing
frequently recurring localized infections during the host’s lifetime [1]. The reacti-
vation of HSV from latency may occur at any time and it is characterized by active
viral replication in the epithelium causing vesicular eruptions in human mucosae
and skin. The rupture of these vesicles and the consequent cell necrosis leave the
characteristic herpetic lesion or ulcer.

Basically, there are two distinct types of herpes simplex virus, namely, HSV
Type I and HSV Type II. The former generally involves infection above the waist
(ocular and facial) while the latter infects tissues below the waist. Here we discuss
a mathematical model proposed to describe the growth of corneal ulcers caused by
HSV Type I [2]. This infection is common and frequently causes corneal opaciﬁ-
cation. Traditionally the morphology of the corneal ulcers has been described as
either dendritic or amoeboid. The dendritic ulcers are by far the more frequent
form and, though they are self-limited in general, ocasionally they can enlarge pro-
gressively changing to the amoeboid form. This is actually the natural course of the
infection in the case of immunocompromised hosts or of inappropriate use of topic
corticosteroids. In general, the amoeboid ulcers have a prolonged clinical course
when compared to the dendritic ones. Regardless of their morphology, the ulcers
are epithelial lesions that extend through the basement membrane whose swollen
epithelial borders contain active viral particles.

In order to carry out a more quantitative study of the ulcer morphology, the
fractal dimension of clinically diagnosed HSV ulcers (including both dendritic and
amoeboid forms) have been estimated suggesting that their outlines are fractal
objects [3]. While the dendritic ulcers include branching and linear lesions, the
geographic ulcers are no longer linear and as they increase in size, their perimeters
become less and less irregular.
In addition to its usefulness as a classiﬁcation
tool, the fractal properties of the ulcers may give information on the underlying
mechanisms of viral spread within the epithelial tissue. For instance, a theory
based only on the neurotropism of HSV and the dendritic-like distribution of nerve
terminals can explain the branching pattern observed in dendritic ulcers [4], but it
fails to explain the decrease of the fractal dimension (perimeter irregularity) with
increasing ulcer sizes. An alternative explanation put forward by Landini et al [2],
which will be the main focus of this paper, considers the ulcer shape as the natural
outcome of the contiguous spread of viral particles modulated by variations in the
cell susceptibilities to infection. To take into account the fact that viruses only
infect cells that have appropriate receptor molecules on their surface, those authors
proposed a cellular automaton model for the HSV I spread in which the corneal
epithelial tissue is modeled by a two-dimensional lattice.
In their model, each
lattice site may be occupied either by a permissive cell (with probability q) or by
a resistant cell (with probability 1 − q). More pointedly, a permissive cell becomes

2

infected whenever there are at least one infected cell in its neighborhood, while a
resistant cell becomes infected if the number of infected and dead neighboring cells
is larger than or equal to the integer parameter R > 1 that measures the degree of
resistance of the cell [2].

The simulated ulcers obtained with the cellular automaton have the same qual-
itative features of the clinical lesions and, in addition, for appropriate choices of
the degree of resistance R a dramatic change on the morphology of the ulcers is
observed as the initial concentration of permissive cells q increases beyond a cer-
tain value [2]. This phenomenon was conjectured to be of a (qualitatively) similar
nature as the ordinary percolation phase transition. The main contribution of this
paper is to show, through the calculation of the dynamic and static critical expo-
nents, that in the cases where a phase-transition does occur (R ≥ 5), the transition
belongs indeed to the universality class of the ordinary percolation [5, 6]. To carry
out this analysis we use the so-called dynamic Monte Carlo method or spreading
analysis [7, 8] whose idea is to study the spreading of the infection starting from
a conﬁguration with a single infected cell on the center of the lattice. Clearly this
technique is very well suited to our investigation since the characterization of the
spreading behavior of the infection is exactly the issue we address in this paper.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Following Landini et al [2],
in Sec. 2 we give the set of rules that govern the evolution of the HSV I infection
in a two-dimensional square lattice and present the evidences for the existence of
a threshold phenomenon or phase transition for R ≥ 5. In Sec. 3 we characterize
this phase transition using the dynamic Monte Carlo method which allows the
computation of the critical dynamic exponents that describe quantitatively the
spreading of the infection from a single infected cell. Finally, some concluding
remarks are presented in Sec. 4.

2 Model

The cellular automaton model is deﬁned in a square lattice consisting of (L +
1) × (L + 1) sites, where each site is associated to a cell. Each cell is modeled by
a four-state automaton corresponding to the diﬀerent states of this cell: healthy
permissive, healthy resistant, infected and dead. Except for the central cell, the
initial state of any cell in the lattice is set either as permissive or resistant with
probabilities q and 1 − q, respectively, so that there are no dead cells at the outset.
The infection spreads from the single central infected cell and the ulcer (i.e., the
cluster of dead cells) grows according to the following deterministic rules [2]:

(1) An infected cell dies in the next time step.

(2) A healthy permissive cell becomes infected if at least one of its neighboring

(3) A healthy resistant cell becomes infected if at least R > 1 of its neighboring

cells is infected.

cells are infected or dead.

The neighborhood of a given cell consists of its ﬁrst and second nearest neighbors
(Moore neighborhood). The infection and subsequent death of a resistant cell
surrounded by R or more dead cells is justiﬁed by the lack of tissue support. In
addition, this is necessary to prevent the occurrence of large ulcers with small islands
of resistant cells, which are not observed clinically [2]. The four-state automaton
considered allows transitions of one of the healthy states to the infected and dead
states in a cyclic manner. At each time step we perform a parallel updating of all
cell states.

For R ≤ 8 we are dealing with a variant of the so-called diﬀusion percolation
process where the geometry changes via a dynamic process and the nature of the
growth depends on the local environment [9]. For ﬁnite lattice sizes and open
boundary conditions the above rules are repeated until either there are no more
cells to infect or an infected cell reaches the lattice boundary. These diﬀerent modes
of termination generate dendritic (self-limited) and amoeboid (irrestricted) ulcers,
respectively. It is interesting to note that the ordinary site percolation process is
recovered for R > 8, since in this case a resistant cell can never become infected
and so the infection can propagate only through the permissive cells.

4

To illustrate the dependence of the diﬀerent termination modes, and hence ulcer
forms, on the control parameters R and q of the model we present in Fig. 1 the
fraction of irrestricted ulcers generated in 1000 runs. Each run corresponds to a
diﬀerent initial conﬁguration of the lattice. Clearly, this fraction can be identiﬁed
with the percolation probability Π [5, 6]. Rather interestingly, we have found
that the results for R ≥ 6 are indistinguishable within the numerical precision.
Actually, this is expected since there is a preferred direction for the propagation
of the infection, namely, from the center to the lattice boundaries, and so only the
neighborhood facing the infection front matters to update the state of a healthy
cell. Since the largest size of the error bars in this as well as in the next ﬁgure
is twice the size of the symbols, they were ommited for the sake of clarity. More
importantly, we have found that for R ≤ 4, the results become independent of the
lattice size already for L ≥ 101.

However, for R ≥ 5 the dependence on the lattice size, illustrated in Fig. 2 for
R = 5, indicates the occurrence of an atypical threshold phenomenon at a critical
value qc in the limit L → ∞. In fact, as q increases from 0 to 1 the percolation
probability Π vanishes for q < qc, undergoes a discontinuous transition to some
value Π = Πc > 0 at q = qc and then increases monotonically towards 1. This
transition is atypical in the sense that Πc is not equal to 1 above qc, as in the case
of the ordinary percolation transition [5, 6], which means that in this regime there
is a ﬁnite probability that the infection does not percolate, i.e., a dendritic ulcer is
formed. The reason for that is due simply to the fact that the spreading process
starts from a single central cell so that if the infection happens to percolate in a
lattice of a given size then it is certain to percolate in a smaller lattice too, i.e.,
8
Π(L1) ≥ Π(L2) for L1 < L2. In particular, Π(3) = 1 − (1 − p)
yields an upper
bound to Π(∞). Of course, if the initial setting is such that there is an extensive
number of infected cells, say αL with α < 1, randomly distributed over the bottom
side of the lattice and periodic boundary conditions on the lateral sides, then the
usual result Πc = 1 is recovered [10]. In fact, since the curves for diﬀerent lattice
sizes do not cross, the standard ﬁnite size scaling analysis aiming at determining
both qc and the spatial correlation length exponent ν⊥ for R ≥ 5 (see, e.g., Ref.
[5]) fails spectacularly and so we have to resort to other means to estimate those
quantities.

3 Spreading analysis

We turn now to the analysis of the spreading behavior of the viral infection starting
from a single infected cell located in the center of a lattice of inﬁnite size. Finite
size eﬀects are absent because the lattice size is taken large enough so that during
the time we follow the evolution the infection front can never reach the lattice
boundaries. This of course sets an upper limit to the time we can follow the viral
spread and so, for instance, for lattices of size L = 4005 we let the infection evolve
up to t = 2000. As usual, we concentrate on the time dependence of the following
key quantities [7]: (i) the average number of dead and infected cells n(t); (ii) the

over which the ulcer has spread r2(t). For each time t we carry out 104 independent
runs, hence p(t) is simply the fraction of runs for which there is at least one infected
cell in the lattice at time t. At the transition point qc we expect that the measured
quantities obey the following scaling laws [7]

where δ, η and z are dynamic exponents. Since the fractal dimension df of the
ulcer at a given time t is deﬁned as n(t) ∼ rdf we have

at the critical point. Note that this equation is diﬀerent from the one used in the
studies of directed percolation (see, e.g., Ref. [11]) because in the present case all
runs generate an ulcer and so n(t) as well as r2(t) are averages taken over all runs.
In Figs. 3, 4 and 5 we present log-log plots of p(t), n(t) and r2(t), respectively, as
functions of t in the vicinity of the critical point for R = 5. The asymptotic straight
lines observed in these ﬁgures are the signature of critical behavior while upward
and downward deviations indicate supercritical (q > qc) and subcritical (q < qc)
behaviors, respectively. We recall that in the subcritical regime only dendritic ulcers
are formed, while in the supercritical regime the formation of amoeboid ulcers is
much more frequent (see Fig. 2). The data shown in Fig. 3 yield qc = 0.3945±0.0002
where the error is estimated by determining two values of q as close as possible to
the critical point for which upward and downward deviations can be observed. A
precise estimate for the dynamic critical exponents is obtained by considering the
local slopes of the curves shown in the previous ﬁgures. For instance, the local
slope δ(t) is deﬁned by [11]

which for large t behaves as

− δ (t) =

ln [p(t)/p(t/8)]
ln 8

,

δ (t) ∼ δ +

t

where a is a constant. Analogous expressions hold for η(t) and z(t). Hence plots
of the local slopes as functions of 1/t allow the calculation of the critical ex-
ponents. Applying this procedure for the critical curves we ﬁnd the exponents
δ = 0.0870 ± 0.0001, η = 1.5866 ± 0.0007 and z = 1.6843 ± 0.0003. The errors in the
critical exponents are, as usual, the statistical errors obtained by ﬁtting the local
slopes by straight lines in the large t regime. We expect, of course, that the (un-
controlled) systematic errors are much larger than those. Using Eq. (4) we obtain
df = 1.8840±0.0005 which is in very good agreement with the analytical prediction
for the ordinary percolation df = 91/48 ≈ 1.896 [5, 6].

As the dynamic exponents δ, η and z for the ordinary percolation problem
are not very well known, to show unambiguously that this ulcer formation model
belongs to the universality class of the ordinary percolation we ought to estimate
the static exponents β and ν⊥. We recall that the exponent β gives a measure
of how the fraction of lattice cells belonging to an inﬁnite cluster vanishes as the
percolation threshold qc is approached in the supercritical regime while ν⊥ is the
correlation-length exponent in the space direction. To do so we calculate ﬁrst the
exponent νk which governs the decay of the concentration of infected cells i(t) in
the subcritical regime. In fact, since in this regime the correlations are short-ranged
one expects i(t) to decay exponentially [7]

i(t) ≈ A (q) exp [− (qc − q)νk t]

t → ∞

where A (q) is some time independent function. Fig. 6 not only illustrates the
adequacy of this assumption but permits also the evaluation of the decay constant

(7)

(8)

λ = (qc − q)νk

from the asymptotic slopes of the curves ln i vs. t. The results presented in Fig. 7,
showing the dependence of λ on the distance qc − q from the critical point, allows
the calculation of the exponent νk as the slope of the straight line, yielding νk =
1.54 ± 0.03. Once this exponent is known we can use the scaling relations β = νk δ
and ν⊥ = zνk/2 [7] to estimate the static exponents. We ﬁnd β = 0.134 ± 0.003 and
ν⊥ = 1.30 ± 0.03 which, within error bars, are in agreement with the exact values of
the corresponding exponents of the ordinary percolation, namely, β = 5/36 ≈ 0.139
and ν⊥ = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 [5, 6].

We have carried out a similar spreading analysis for R ≥ 6 and, as hinted in
Fig. 1, we have found a slightly larger percolation threshold, namely, qc = 0.4075 ±
0.0002 which, within error bars, is shown to be independent of the value of R ≥ 6.
Furthermore, since the larger the resistance parameter R, the more similar the
ulcer formation problem is to the ordinary site percolation, we have found the same
dynamic and static critical exponents as for the case R = 5, as expected.

4 Conclusion

Using the dynamic Monte Carlo method we have shown unambiguously that the
phase transition observed in the model for formation of herpes simplex ulcers pro-
posed by Landini et al [2] belongs to the universality class of the ordinary percola-
tion. The value of this ﬁnding should not be underrated since the infection process
actually resembles a diﬀusion percolation process where the growth depends on the
local environment, in the sense that the decision on whether or not a resistant cell
will become infected depends on the time-dependent states of several of its neigh-
bors. Furthermore, since the ulcer formation model described here may be thought
of as a damage spreading process, one could expect that the transition were in the
universality class of the (2 + 1) directed percolation instead. However, as pointed

out by Grassberger [12], this is not so because in the ulcer formation model the
damage never heals (even if it does not spread), i.e., the probability that an infected
or dead cell becomes healthy is zero.

The ﬁnding that for R < 5 the model does not present a phase transition
reﬂects the nontrivial role played by the resistance parameter R in this percolation
process. In these noncritical cases the probability that an inﬁnite or irrestricted
ulcer is generated is given by the smooth size-independent curves shown in Fig.
1. Similarly to a noncritical forest ﬁre model [13, 14] the growing of this type of
ulcer may be characterized by infection fronts with fractal dimension D whose value
probably depends on the resistance parameter R (of course, D = 1 for R = 1). An
additional feature that makes the quantitative study of this viral spreading model
rather challenging is the result that the percolation probability curves for diﬀerent
lattice sizes do not cross (see Fig. 2), which complicates enormously the estimate
of the percolation threshold and critical exponents through the standard ﬁnite size
scaling method.

Some remarks on the biological interpretation of our results are in order. Ac-
cording to the specialized literature [1, 2, 3, 4], amoeboid ulcers are, in general,
observed in immunocompromised patients or in patients that made inappropriated
use of corticosteroids. In the present model, these conditions would correspond to
a decrease of the degree of resistance R of the resistant cells or to an increase of
the initial concentration q of permisssive cells. Although this model does not take
into account the recurrent characteristic of this kind of infection, in which case
the variability of q would probably play an important role, nor the possibility of
variation of R during the course of the infection, its predictions are in qualitative
agreement with the clinical observations. In fact, Fig. 1 points out the prevalence
of amoeboid ulcers when R decreases or q increases. This agreement lends sup-
port to the hypothesis that the morphology of the ulcers is determined by the viral
spreading through cells with diﬀerent susceptibilities to infection.

To conclude we should mention that an extension of the original model pro-
posed by Landini et al in which both the regeneration of dead cells as well as the
spontaneous outbreak of infection anywhere in the lattice are taken into account
has already been considered in the literature [15]. Interestingly, in this case the
viral spreading model becomes very similar to the critical forest ﬁre model with
immune trees [16, 17]. In particular, the resistance parameter R of the ulcer for-
mation model is akin to the immunity probability, i.e., the probability that a tree
is not ignited though one of its neighbors is burning. According to a conjecture
put forward by Grassberger [12], the extended ulcer formation model should be in
the universality class of directed percolation, since it allows for the regeneration of
dead cells. This suggestion is strengthened by the ﬁnding that the forest ﬁre model
with immune trees is in that class of universality [17].

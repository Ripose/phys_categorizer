Abstract

This paper considers three kinds of length sequences of the complete genome.
Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis, spectral analysis, and the mean distance spanned
within time L are used to discuss the correlation property of these sequences.
Through comparing the appropriate exponents of the three methods, it is found
that the exponent related to the mean distance is the best scale to characterise the
correlation property of the time series. The values of the exponents of these three
kinds of length sequences of bacteria indicate that the increments of the sequences
are uncorrelated (γ = 1.0 ± 0.03).
It is also found that these sequences exhibit
1/f noise in some interval of frequency (f > 1). The length of this interval of
frequency depends on the length of the sequence. The shape of the periodogram in
f > 1 exhibits some periodicity. The period seems to depend on the length and the
complexity of the length sequence.

1 Introduction

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the ﬁnding of long-range dependence
(LRD) in DNA sequences [1 − 15]. Li et al[1] found that the spectral density of a DNA
sequence containing mostly introns shows 1/f β behaviour, which indicates the presence
of LRD. The correlation properties of coding and noncoding DNA sequences were ﬁrst
studied by Peng et al[2] in their fractal landscape or DNA walk model. The DNA walk
deﬁned in [2] is that the walker steps “up” if a pyrimidine (C or T ) occurs at position
i along the DNA chain, while the walker steps “down” if a purine (A or G) occurs at
position i. Peng et al[2] discovered that there exists LRD in noncoding DNA sequences
while the coding sequences correspond to a regular random walk. By doing a more detailed
analysis, Chatzidimitriou, Dreismann and Larhammar[5] concluded that both coding and
noncoding sequences exhibit LRD. A subsequent work by Prabhu and Claverie[6] also
substantially corroborates these results. If one considers more details by distinguishing
C from T in pyrimidine, and A from G in purine (such as two or three-dimensional DNA
walk model[8] and maps given in [9]), then the presence of base correlation has been
found even in coding region. Alternatively, Vose[10], based on equal-symbol correlation,
showed a power law behaviour for the sequences studied regardless of the percent of intron
contents. Investigations based on diﬀerent models seem to suggest diﬀerent results, as they
all look into only a certain aspect of the entire DNA sequence. It is therefore important
to investigate the degree of correlations in a model-independent way.

Since the ﬁrst complete genome of the free-living bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium
was sequenced in 1995[16], an ever-growing number of complete genomes has been de-
posited in public databases. The availability of complete genomes induces the possibility
to ask some global questions on these sequences. The avoided and under-represented
strings in some bacterial complete genomes have been discussed in [17, 18, 19]. A time
series model of CDS in complete genome has also been proposed in [20].

One may ignore the composition of the four kinds of bases in coding and noncod-
ing segments and only considers the rough structure of the complete genome or long
DNA sequences. Provata and Almirantis [21] proposed a fractal Cantor pattern of DNA.
They map coding segments to ﬁlled regions and noncoding segments to empty regions of
random Cantor set and then calculate the fractal dimension of the random fractal set.
They found that the coding/noncoding partition in DNA sequences of lower organisms
is homogeneous-like, while in the higher eucariotes the partition is fractal. This result
seems too rough to distinguish bacteria because the fractal dimensions of bacteria they
gave out are all the same. The classiﬁcation and evolution relationship of bacteria is one
of the most important problem in DNA research. Yu and Anh[22] proposed a time series
model based on the global structure of the complete genome and considered three kinds
of length sequences. After calculating the correlation dimensions and Hurst exponents,
it was found that one can get more information from this model than that of fractal
Cantor pattern. Some results on the classiﬁcation and evolution relationship of bacteria

2

were found in [22]. Naturally it is desirable to know if there exists LRD in these length
sequences. We attempt to answer this question in this paper.

Viewing from the level of structure, the complete genome of an organism is made
up of coding and noncoding segments. Here the length of a coding/noncoding segment
means the number of its bases. Based on the lengths of coding/noncoding segments in
the complete genome, we can get three kinds of integer sequences by the following ways.
i) First we order all lengths of coding and noncoding segments according to the order
of coding and noncoding segments in the complete genome, then replace the lengths of
noncoding segments by their negative numbers. This allows to distinguish lengths of
coding and noncoding segments. This integer sequence is named whole length sequence.
ii) We order all lengths of coding segments according to the order of coding segments

in the complete genome. We name this integer sequence coding length sequence.

iii) We order all lengths of noncoding segments according to the order of noncoding
segments in the complete genome. This integer sequence is named noncoding length
sequence.

We can now view these three kinds of integer sequences as time series. In the follow-
ing, we will investigate the correlation property through Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
(DFA)[23] and spectral analysis.

2 Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis and spectral analy-

sis

y(k) = Pk

We denote a time series as X(t), t = 1, · · · , N. First the time series is integrated as
t=1[X(t) − Xave], where Xave is the average over the whole time period. Next,
the integrated time series is divided into boxes of equal length, n. In each box of length n,
a least-squares line is ﬁt to the data, representing the trend in that box. The y coordinate
of the straight line segments is denoted by yn(k). We then detrend the integrated time
series, y(k), by subtracting the local trend, yn(k), in each box. The root-mean-square
ﬂuctuation of this integrated and detrended time series is calculated as

F (n) =

vuut 1

N

NX

k=1

[y(k) − yn(k)]2

(1)

Typically, F (n) will increase with box size n. A linear relationship on a double log graph
indicates the presence of scaling

F (n) ∝ nα.

(2)

Under such conditions, the ﬂuctuations can be characterised by the scaling exponent α,
the slope of the line relating ln F (n) to ln n. For uncorrelated data, the integrated value,
y(k) corresponds to a random walk, and therefore, α = 0.5. An value of 0.5 < α < 1.0

indicates the presence of LRD so that a large interval is more likely to be followed by
a large interval and vice versa.
In contrast, 0 < α < 0.5 indicates a diﬀerent type of
power-law correlations such that large and small values of time series are more likely to
alternate. For examples, we give the DFA of the coding length sequence of A. aeolicus on
the left of Figure 1.

Now we consider the discrete Fourier transform[24] of the time series X(t), t = 1, · · · , N

is the power spectrum of X (t). In recent studies, it has been found [25] that many natural
phenomena lead to the power spectrum of the form 1/f β. This kind of dependence was
named 1/f noise, in contrast to white noise S(f ) = const, i.e. β = 0. Let the frequency f
take k values fk = k/N, k = 1, · · · , N. From the ln(f ) v.s. ln(S(f )) graph, the existence
of 1/f β doesn’t seem apparent. For example, we give the ﬁgure of the coding length
sequence of A. aeolicus on the right of Figure 1.

We also analyse the time series using the quantity M(L), the mean distance a walker
spanned within time L. Dunki and Ambuhl[26, 27] used this quantity to discuss the scaling
property in temporal patterns of schizophrenia. Denote

W (j) :=

[X(t) − Xave],

from which we get the walks

M(L) :=< |W (j) − W (j + L)| >j,

(5)

(6)

where < >j denotes the average over j, and j = 1, · · · , N − L. The time shift L typically
varies from 1, · · · , N/2. From a physics viewpoint, M(L) might be thought of as the

variance evolution of a random walker’s total displacement mapped from the time series
X(t). M(L) may be assessed for LRD [28] (e.g. M(L) ∝ Lα′, α′ = 1/2 corresponding to
the random case). We give some examples to estimate the scale parameter α′ in the left
ﬁgure of Figure 2. Dunki et al[27] proposed the following scale which seems to perform
better than the scale α′. The deﬁnition

leads to

W ′(j) :=

|X(t) − Xave|

M ′(L) :=< |W ′(j) − W ′(j + L)| >j .

Analyses of test time series showed that (8) are more robust against distortion or dis-
cretization of the corresponding amplitudes X(t) than (6). From the ln(L) v.s. ln(M ′(L))
plane, we ﬁnd the relation

M ′(L) ∝ Lγ.

(9)

A generated completely random sequence with length 1024 gives the scale γ to be
1.001103. We also carried out this kind of analysis on coding length sequence of A.
aeolicus, B. burgdorferi and T. maritima. The results are reported in the right ﬁgure of
Figure 2.

3 Data and results.

More than 21 bacterial complete genomes are now available in public databases.
There are ﬁve Archaebacteria: Archaeoglobus fulgidus (aful), Pyrococcus abyssi (pabyssi),
Methanococcus jannaschii (mjan), Aeropyrum pernix (aero) and Methanobacterium ther-
moautotrophicum (mthe); four Gram-positive Eubacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis

5

(mtub), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (mpneu), Mycoplasma genitalium (mgen), and Bacillus
subtilis (bsub). The others are Gram-negative Eubacteria. These consist of two hyperther-
mophilic bacteria: Aquifex aeolicus (aquae) and Thermotoga maritima (tmar); six pro-
teobacteria: Rhizobium sp. NGR234 (pNGR234), Escherichia coli (ecoli), Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae (hinf), Helicobacter pylori J99 (hpyl99), Helicobacter pylori 26695 (hpyl) and
Rockettsia prowazekii (rpxx); two chlamydia Chlamydia trachomatis (ctra) and Chlamy-
dia pneumoniae (cpneu), and two Spirochete: Borrelia burgdorferi (bbur) and Treponema
pallidum (tpal).

We calculate scales α, β of low frequencies (f < 1) and γ of three kinds of length
sequences of the above 21 bacteria. The estimated results are given in Table 1 ( where we
denote by αwhole, αcod and αnoncod the scales of DFA of the whole, coding and noncoding
length sequences, from top to bottom, in the increasing order of the value of αwhole ) and
Table 2 ( where we denote by βwhole, βcod and βnoncod the scales of spectral analysis of
the whole, coding and noncoding length sequences, from top to bottom, in the decreasing
order of the value of βwhole; we denote by γwhole, γcod and γnoncod the scales of γ of the
whole, coding and noncoding length sequences).

From the right ﬁgure of Figure 1 it is seen that S(f ) does not display clear power-law
1/f dependence on the frequencies when f < 1. We want to know if there is another
region of frequencies in which S(f ) displays perfect power-law 1/f dependence on the
frequencies. We carried out the spectral analysis for f > 1, and found that S(f ) displays
almost a perfect power-law 1/f dependence on the frequencies in some interval:

S(f ) ∝

1
f β .

(10)

We give the results for coding length sequences of M. genitalium, A. fulgidus, A. aeolicus
and E. coli (their length are 303, 1538, 891 and 3034 respectively) in Figure 3, where we
take k values fk = 3k (k = 1, · · · , 1000) of the frequency f . From Figure 3, it is seen that
the length of the interval of frequency in which S(f ) displays almost a perfect power-law
1/f depends on the length of the length sequence. The shorter sequence corresponds to
the larger interval.

From Figure 3, one can see that the power spectrum exhibit some kind of periodicity.
But the period seems to depend on the length of the sequence. We also guess that the
period also depends on the complexity of the sequence. To support this conjecture, we
got a promoter DNA sequence from the gene bank, then replaced A by -2, C by -1,
G by 1 and T by 2 (this map is given in [9]); so we obtained a sequence on alphabet
{−2, −1, 1, 2}. Then a subsequences was obtained with the length the same as the coding
length sequences of A. aeolicus, A. fulgidus and M. genitalium (their length are 891, 1538
and 303 respectively). A comparison is given in Figure 4, but the results are not clear-cut.

4 Discussion and conclusions

Although the existence of the archaebacterial urkingdom has been accepted by many
biologists, the classiﬁcation of bacteria is still a matter of controversy[29]. The evolu-
tionary relationship of the three primary kingdoms (i.e. archeabacteria, eubacteria and
eukaryote) is another crucial problem that remains unresolved[29].

From Table 1, we can roughly divide bacteria into two classes, one class with αwhole
less than 0.5, and the other with αwhole greater than 0.5. All Archaebacteria belong to
the same class except Pyrococcus abyssi. All Proteobacteria belong to the same class
except E. coli; in particular, the closest Proteobacteria Helicobacter pylori 26695 and
Helicobacter pylori J99 group with each other. In the class with αwhole < 0.5, we have
αcod < αnoncod except hpyl99 and mgen; but in the other class we have αcod > αnoncod.

From Table 1 and 2 , we can say that all these sequences are not far from being
random, hence there is no LRD present except a few bacteria. Whole length sequences
are more likely random than other two kinds of length sequences. If we consider more
details from the exponents α and β, it seems that there is LRD in these sequences. And
the DFA performs better than spectral analysis, which supports the view of [23]. But
from Figures 1 and 2, the exponent γ is seen more convincing than the exponents α and
β because the error of estimating γ using the least-squares linear ﬁt is much less than
that of the other two exponents. From Table 2, we get γ = 1.0 ± 0.03. Hence we can
conclude that all these length sequences are random sequences; in other words, there is
no trace of LRD in them. On the level of structure in the complete genome, we have the
same conclusion as when we directly consider DNA sequences[14].

We ﬁnd in an interval of frequency (f > 1), S(f ) displays perfect power-law 1/f

dependence on the frequencies (see the left ﬁgure of Figure 3)

S(f ) ∝

1
f β .

The length of the interval of frequency in which S(f ) displays almost a perfect power-law
1/f depends on the length of the length sequence. The shorter sequence corresponds to
the larger interval. The shape of the graph of power spectrum in f > 1 also exhibits some
kind of periodicity. The period seems to depend on the length and the complexity of the
length sequence.

Large ﬁnite size eﬀects in RNA secondary structures

The ensemble of RNA secondary structures of uniform sequences is studied analytically. We
calculate the partition function for very long sequences and discuss how the cross-over length,
beyond which asymptotic scaling laws apply, depends on thermodynamic parameters. For realistic
choices of parameters this length can be much longer than natural RNA molecules. This has to be
taken into account when applying asymptotic theory to interpret experiments or numerical results.

Folding of biopolymers is a fundamental process in
molecular biology without which life as we know it would
not be possible. In biopolymer folding, well-characterized
interactions between individual monomers make a poly-
mer fold into a speciﬁc structure believed to minimize the
total interaction energy. The apparent simplicity in the
formulation of this biopolymer folding problem is in sharp
contrast with the immense challenges faced in actually
describing biopolymer folding quantitatively caused by
the intricate interplay of monomer-monomer interactions
and the constraint that the monomers are connected into
a chain of a certain sequence. The biological importance
of biopolymer folding paired with this immense intellec-
tual challenge has sparked numerous computational and
theoretical studies [1]. These studies do not only attempt
quantitative predictions of speciﬁc structures but also fo-
cus on more fundamental properties of the biopolymer
folding problem such as its phase diagram.

While the bulk of the work concentrates on the folding
of proteins due to its overwhelming importance in phar-
maceutical applications, recently RNA has been iden-
tiﬁed as an ideal model system for biopolymer fold-
ing [2, 3]. RNA is a biopolymer of four diﬀerent bases
G, C, A, and U. The most important interaction among
these bases is the formation of Watson-Crick, i.e., A–
U and G–C, base pairs. This comparatively simple in-
teraction scheme makes the RNA folding problem very
amenable to theoretical approaches without losing the
overall ﬂavor of the general biopolymer folding problem.
Again, a lot of eﬀort has been devoted to understanding
fundamental properties of RNA folding such as the ther-
modynamic phases an ensemble of RNA molecules can be
in as a function of temperature, an external force acting
on the molecules, and sequence design [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

All these theoretical approaches are concerned with
the behavior of RNA molecules in the thermodynamic
limit. In order to compare these theoretical predictions
with experiments or numerical studies it is thus impor-
tant to know which role ﬁnite size eﬀects play, i.e., at
which size of a molecule the universal predictions of the
asymptotic theories are expected to hold. This is the
question we aim to answer here. We study homogenous
RNA sequences which allows us to analytically solve for

the universal asymptotic behavior as well as the cross-
over length below which the universal theory is not ap-
plicable any more. We ﬁnd that this cross-over length
depends very strongly on the sequence of the molecule.
For realistic energy parameters we ﬁnd that the cross-
over length can be as large as 10,000 bases. This is about
the largest size of naturally occuring RNAs as well as the
largest length of RNA molecules amenable to quantita-
tive computational approaches. Thus, we conclude that
ﬁnite size eﬀects have to be seriously taken into account
when describing RNA folding by asymptotic theories.

The letter is organized as follows: First, we formally
introduce the RNA secondary structure formation prob-
lem. Then, we analytically derive the ﬁnite size eﬀects
of the simplest model of RNA folding namely a homoge-
neous sequence without loop entropies. While this model
is mainly treated for pedagogical purposes we later sketch
how the result can be generalized to more realistic models
of RNA folding. We conclude by applying our results to
experimentally known parameters for speciﬁc sequences
thereby pointing out how enormous ﬁnite size eﬀects in
the RNA secondary structure formation problem can be.
An RNA secondary structure S is characterized by its
set of Watson-Crick pairs (i, j) where i and j denote the
ith and jth base of the RNA polymer respectively (con-
ventionally i < j). Here, we apply a reasonable approxi-
mation to exclude so-called pseudoknots [2], i.e., for two

FIG. 2: Loop deﬁnitions and their Boltzmann factors.

quantitative models of RNA secondary structure forma-
tion [11, 12], it is commonly assumed that the total free
energy of a structure is the sum of free energies of the
loops in the structure. Computational algorithms based
on this assumption [13] predict the secondary structure
of short RNA molecules rather well [14]. To include loop
entropies in our model, we introduce several Boltzmann
factors (see Fig. 2) for the diﬀerent loop types. The val-
ues of these free energy parameters have been carefully
measured [15] such that our model can be applied quan-
titatively to realistic RNA molecules. Typically, the free
energy of a stacking loop is large and negative (s
1)
while the free energies for all the other loops tend to be
large and positive, leading to Boltzmann factors much
less than one. The binding energy ǫ0 of the simple model
introduced above is now absorbed into the loop energy
of a stacking loop.

≫

In principle, the entropy also depends on the size of the
loop. However, larger loops come with greater energetic
penalties due to the reduced number of base pairs formed
without a comparable entropic gain. Thus, the contribu-
tion of structures with longer loops to the ensemble can
be neglected as we explicitly veriﬁed [16].

FIG. 3: Separation of stems from the bubble structure.

Again we want to calculate the partition function of
the structure ensemble and derive the cross-over length
as a function of the loop parameters. To this end we
separate the secondary structure into two categories as
shown in Fig. 3. One is the bubble structure which con-
tains only hairpins and multiloops. The other is the stem
structure, which connects the bubbles, containing only
stacking loops, bulges, and interior loops. We will study
each of them individually and later combine the results.
For stem structures, to explore all possible ways of
pair bindings, again we ﬁnd a graphical recursion rela-
tion (Fig. 4). By deﬁning the partition function of stem

FIG. 5: Recursion relation for bubble structures. In a), start-

or a multiloop. The single straight line means no bindings.
In b), the double line stands for all possible multiloops and
again it can be decomposed into two cases where the last base
is either unbound or bound. Since a multiloop has to have
at least 3 branches, the term with two arches gives us two
branches and the last term in the recursion will produce more
branches.

Similarly, a recursion relation for bubble structures can
be found (Fig. 5). With B(N

tion function of the bubble structures with N bases, the
z-transform of the recursion relation results in

We notice that the leading singularity in

from the branch cut induced by the square root. Thus,
the inverse z-transform leads to the same universal be-
havior (3) with an exponent θ = 3/2 as the simple model
we studied ﬁrst. However, our focus here is the non-
universal behavior of the cross-over length depending on
the parameters s, b, i, h, and m.

The leading term depends only on s, h, and m. From
the factor 1/√hm, the cross-over length can be inter-
preted as the minimum length that allows a certain de-
gree of branching. If the sequence is short, the dominant
structure is a stem with one hairpin at the end because
for small h and m, hairpins and multiloops are not favor-
able. In order to reach a certain degree of branching, we
need many bases to allow hairpins and multiloops. Simi-
larly, N0 is proportional to s because the more favorable
a stacking loop is, the less the molecule is willing to form
hairpins or multiloops. Since b and i appear only in the
higher order terms, they can be neglected altogether.

As these results are based on the large s expansion, it
is interesting to see how they compare to exact solutions.
For smaller s, the branch point zc is further away from
√s but it can still be obtained numerically as the root
of a polynomial of degree 4. With this numerical value
we can derive the exact value of the cross-over length N0
by expanding Eq. (6) around its branch point zc. Fig. 6
approaches
shows how the approximated formula
the exact value as s gets large. Typical values for the
stacking Boltzmann factor s involving GC pairs are s
≥
30, so the approximation is very good. For stacking loops
involving AU pairs, s is around 5 so a deviation from the
large s formula can be seen. However, since N0 only sets
the order of magnitude of the length beyond which the
asymptotic theory is applicable, a deviation by a factor
of 2 at s = 5 is still a good estimation.

To illustrate the correctness of the calculations and get
a feeling for typical cross-over lengths, we use the Vienna
package [11] to determine thermodynamic quantities with
a very realistic sequence model. As an observable, we
choose the average size l of a structure. This quantity
is deﬁned as
is the
probability that bases k and k’ are paired. It measures
the average number of base pairs to be crossed when con-
necting the N/2th base to base 1 (Fig. 7), which captures
the size of the secondary structure. We expect l to obey

FIG. 7: Direct correspondence between (CAG)n and our
model. The size proﬁle l is also illustrated.

We apply this procedure to repeated sequences of the
type (CAG)n, (AU )n and (GC)n, which have a direct
correspondence between the real sequence and our model
indicated in Fig. 7. Thus, we can use the experimentally
determined parameters for the values of s, b, i, h, and m.
For (CAG)n our formula [17] predicts a cross-over
length N0 of 2.3 units which is 6.9 bases. Calculating
the size using the Vienna package [11] and the full set of
experimentally determined parameters leads to N0 = 6.9

bases, in very good agreement with our prediction. This
suggests that ﬁnite size eﬀects are more or less irrelevant.

However, the situation is totally diﬀerent for repeated
AU sequences. The cross-over length of (AU )n is pre-
dicted by our theory to be around 8000 bases, which is
almost the largest size of naturally occurred RNA se-
quence. For (GC)n sequences, the situation is even more
dramatic with a predicted cross-over length about 16000
bases. This is beyond the limits of what we can verify by
comparison with the Vienna package and suggests that
the structure ensemble of (AU )n and (GC)n molecules
can never be described by the asymptotic theory for any
naturally available molecules.

We conclude that the cross-over length is strongly se-

In this region, ﬁnite
size eﬀects are very important and have to be taken into
account in any numerical simulation or interpretation of
experimental data in terms of asymptotic formulae. For
realistic energy model, our work provides an easy way to
estimate this ﬁnite size eﬀect.

Localization properties of residue ﬂuctuations in globular proteins are studied theoretically by using
the Gaussian network model. Participation ratio for each residue ﬂuctuation mode is calculated. It
is found that the relationship between participation ratio and frequency is similar for all globular
proteins, indicating a universal behavior in spite of their diﬀerent size, shape, and architecture.

Proteins are important biological macromolecules that
control almost all functions of living organisms. It was
once believed that proteins are rather amorphous and
without well-deﬁned structures. After more and more
structures have been determined by crystallographic and
NMR methods, it has revealed that protein structures are
far from random. They have well-deﬁned secondary and
tertiary structures which comprise essential information
relating to their functions and mechanisms.

Proteins in the folded states are not static. Instead, the
constituent residues ﬂuctuate near their native positions
owing to the ﬁnite temperature eﬀects [1]. It has been
now well accepted that the ﬂuctuations are crucial for en-
zyme catalysis and for biological activity [2,3]. Recently,
there has been considerable interest in the correlations
between protein functions and ﬂuctuations [2]. Intensive
theoretical studies on ﬂuctuations of protein have been
carried out based on either molecular dynamics simula-
tions or normal mode analyses (NMA) by using all-atom
empirical potentials [4]. It has been shown that the NMA
is a very useful method to study protein ﬂuctuations [5,6].
The use of atomic approaches becomes computational de-
manding when dealing with large proteins. For proteins
composed of more than thousand residues, it is diﬃcult
to investigate by using the conventional atomic models
and potentials. On the other hand, coarse-grained pro-
tein models and simpliﬁed force ﬁelds have revealed a
great success in description of the residue ﬂuctuations of
proteins [7–10]. Although there have been intensive stud-
ies on residue ﬂuctuations, to our knowledge, there is few
study on localization properties of residue ﬂuctuations.

In this paper, based on a coarse-grained protein model,
we show theoretically that there is a similar behavior
in the localization of residue ﬂuctuations for globular
proteins, even though their architectures and sizes are
rather diﬀerent.
In our study of residue ﬂuctuations,
proteins are modeled as elastic networks. The nodes are
residues linked by inter-residue potentials that stabilizes
the folded conformation. This model has been usually re-
ferred as the Gaussian network model (GNM), which can
give a satisfactory description of the ﬂuctuation of folded
proteins [8,9,11–15]. In this model, residues are assumed
to undergo Gaussian-distributed ﬂuctuations about their
native positions. No distinction is made between diﬀerent
types of residues. A single generic harmonic force con-

stant is used for the inter-residue interaction potential
within a cutoﬀ range. We consider residues as the min-
imal representative units and the α-carbons are used as
corresponding sites for residues. Considering all contact-
ing residues, the internal Hamiltonian within the GNM
is given by [8,9]

Here, rij is the separation between the i-th and j-th Cα

the local packing density or the coordination number of
residue i. The inverse of the Kirchhoﬀ matrix can be
decomposed as

Γ−1 = UΛ−1UT,

where U is an orthogonal matrix whose columns
ui (1 ≤ i ≤ N ) are the eigenvectors of Γ, and Λ is di-
agonal matrix of eigenvalue λi of Γ. Cross-correlations

From Eqs. (3) and (4), the mean-square (ms) ﬂuctuations
(also called Debye-Waller or B-factors) of the i-th residue

In our calculation, the cutoﬀ distance rc = 7 ˚A is used,
as adopted in previous studies [8,9]. The harmonic force
constant γ is determined by ﬁtting to the experimental
ms ﬂuctuations. From this model, one can obtain the
ﬂuctuation mode frequencies and eigenvectors for a given
protein. The GNM can in general give results in good
agreement with the observed B-factors [8,9].

The spatial distribution of a given mode is character-
ized by its eigenvectors. To study the localization prop-
erties of protein ﬂuctuations, we have to compute partic-
ipation ratio (PR) for each mode, deﬁned by [17]

Values of PR range from 1/N to unity. PR takes the
value of unity if all residues have equal ﬂuctuation.
If
only one residue ﬂuctuates PR is equal to 1/N . From its
deﬁnition, it is obvious that PR is a measure of the degree
of localization. If the PR is small for a given mode, only a
few residues have considerable ﬂuctuations and the mode
is a localized one. On the other hand, if the PR is large
for a given mode, the mode is delocalized.

It is known that at the physiological temperatures, pro-
tein ﬂuctuates among diﬀerent conformations around its
native one. Therefore, in principle, all contributions from
these conformations should be considered in the calcula-
tion of PR. Unfortunately, only one conformation could
be obtained from experiments. However, these conforma-
tions could be obtained approximately by the following
way. For each residue, it is assumed that it can stay
at any position inside the sphere with a radius of half
the magnitude of ﬂuctuation centered on the position ob-
tained from experiments. A conformation can be derived
by a random choice of the position for each residue while
the inter-distance between two adjacent residues is kept
unchanged within the framework of the SHAKE algo-
rithm [18].

The calculated PR for several proteins is shown in Fig.
1. The Brookhaven Protein Databank (PDB) codes and
references of the proteins studied are listed in Table I.
The modes are numbered starting from the lowest fre-
quency. In the calculations about 100 conformations are
adopted. It is found that if more conformations are used,
the curves will become smoother eventually.

Based on the Anderson localization theory [23,24], Ba-
har et al. [9] suggested that modes with larger ﬂuctu-
ation frequencies would be more localized, indicating a
monotonous decrease in PR with frequency. As sug-
gested by Onuchic et al. [25] proteins are neither ordered
nor random systems, the localization properties of pro-
tein ﬂuctuations should show some intrinsic features from
those in ordered or random systems.

It can be seen from Fig. 1 that starting from lowest fre-
quency, PR ﬁrst decreases with frequency, then increase,
and ﬁnally decreases with frequency. A large number
of globular proteins which have diversiﬁed topology, sec-
ondary structure arrangement and size are calculated.

This behavior of PR seems to be universal, holding for
all globular proteins. Other molecular systems such as
tRNA are also calculated. But the behavior of PR is
qualitatively diﬀerent from proteins (data not shown).
So it is reasonable to conjecture that the diﬀerent behav-
ior of PR in globular proteins from other systems reﬂects
the intrinsic diﬀerence of certain properties. Recently,
Micheletti et al. [27] studied the localization properties
of HIV-1 protease. A similar behavior of PR in HIV-1
protease was found.

To study the origin of the behavior of PR in globu-
lar proteins, the ﬂuctuation patterns of the protein myo-
globin at diﬀerent frequency regions are given in Fig. 2.
The diﬀerent frequency regions in the ﬁgure are labeled
by diﬀerent letters (see Fig. 1).
In the low frequency
region A, the ﬂuctuations represent a collective motion,
characterized by large values of PR. In the region B, the
PR is small, implying localized ﬂuctuations. It is inter-
esting to note that in this region the ﬂuctuations occur
dominantly at the loops. In the highest frequency region
D, the ﬂuctuations are found to be conﬁned to the sec-
ondary structures, resulting small PR. In the region C,
one can ﬁnd that motions of both loops and secondary
structures are involved. The degree of localization is,
however, smaller than that in regions B and D, but it is
larger than that in region A. Therefore, it can be con-
cluded from the ﬂuctuation patterns that the dip of PR
occurred at lower frequency side (region B) originates
from the localized ﬂuctuations at loops that connect the
secondary structures. For conventional disordered solids
or random coils, there are nearly no well-deﬁned sec-
ondary structures and consequently no loops. The re-
sulting PR will show a diﬀerent behavior. It is obvious
that the diﬀerent behavior of PR in globular proteins
from that of conventional random solids or coils origi-
nates from the diﬀerent nature of structures.

To get a deeper insight into how the localization prop-
erties are aﬀected by the topology, a lattice model [26]
with diﬀerent length of the loop is adopted.
In this
model, a protein is represented by a self-avoiding chain
of beads placed on a two-dimensional discrete lattice. In
construction of this model protein, one must consider
the fact that the secondary structure has higher pack-
ing density while the loop has lower packing density. A
core region is introduced by making two helices contacted
each other since cores, with higher packing density, are
important to stabilize the whole structure. Our model
protein shown in Fig. 3(a) consists of two helices, a con-
nective loop, and a core. All residues (beads) are treated
identically. In our calculations only the nearest neighbor
interaction is considered.

Advantages of the lattice model are that we can change
the structure as desired to get insight into how the residue
ﬂuctuations are aﬀected by the changes in structures,

the calculated PR by the GNM for the model protein
with diﬀerent loop length is shown. The loop length is
changed by moving the loop horizontally to the left or

right. The curves are smoothed simply by adjacent av-
eraging using 10 points.
It is obvious that the PR of
ﬂuctuations in the simple model protein shows a similar
behavior to that of real globular proteins. With increase
in the loop length, the PR values of both the dip (region
B in Fig. 1) and the peak (region C in Fig. 1) decrease.
It can be seen from Fig. 3(c) that at the dip the ﬂuc-
tuations are dominant in the loop region. Again, the
origin of the dip is the cause of the loop. For the high-
est frequency mode, the ﬂuctuations dominantly occur
at the helices, especially at the core region. The broad
peak comprises modes which are more delocalized and
worse deﬁned. These peaks are relevant to the coupling
motions among secondary structures.

In summary, localization properties of ﬂuctuations in
globular proteins were studied by using the Gaussian net-
work model. It was found that the participation ratio of
ﬂuctuations in globular proteins shows a universal be-
havior, conﬁrmed by theoretical calculations in both real
globular and model proteins. The loops connecting the
secondary structures are responsible for this feature.

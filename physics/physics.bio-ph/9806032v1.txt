Abstract

We describe the multiresolution wavelet analysis of blood pressure waves in vaso-
vagal-syncope aﬀected patients compared with healthy people one. We argue that
there exist subtle discriminating criteria which allow us to isolate particular features,
common to syncope-aﬀected patients sample, indicating an alternative diagnosis
method for this syndrome. The approach is similar to that followed by Thurner et
al. but on a diﬀerent temporal data series.

1 Introduction

In recent years wavelet techniques have been successfully applied to a wide
area of problems ranging from the image data analysis to the study of human
biological rhythms [1,2]. In the following we will make use of the so called
Discrete-Wavelet-Transform (DWT) based on basis sets which are orthogonal
and complete so oﬀering an alternative to Fourier bases (circular functions) for
the functional decomposition of physiological signal, with particular attention
to possible characteristic patterns connected with vasovagal syncope.

Vasovagal syncope is a sudden, rapid and reversing loss of consciousness, due to
a reduction of cerebral blood ﬂow [3] attributable neither to cardiac structural
or functional pathology, nor to neurological structural alterations, but due to
a bad functioning of the cardiovascular control, induced by that part of the
Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) that regulates the arterial pressure [3,4].
In normal conditions the arterial pressure is maintained at a constant level
by the existence of a negative feed-back mechanism localized in some nervous
centers of the brainstem. As a consequence of a blood pressure variation de-
tected by the baroreceptors, the ANS is able to restore the haemodynamic
situation acting on heart and vases, by means of two eﬀerent pathways, the
vasovagal and sympathetic one, the former acting in the sense of a reduction
of the arterial pressure, the latter in the opposite sense [5]. Vasovagal syn-
cope consists of an abrupt fall of blood pressure corresponding to an acute
haemodynamic reaction produced by a sudden change in the activity of the
ANS (an excessive enhancement of vasovagal outﬂow or a sudden decrease of
simpathetic activity) [3].

Vasovagal syncope is a quite common clinical problem and in the 50% of
patients it is non diagnosed, being labeled as syncope of unknown origin [4,6].
Although the clinical features of this condition are fairly evident, diagnostic
certainty is not always achieved [7] or it takes a long observation period.
Anyway, a speciﬁc diagnosis of vasovagal syncope is practicable [6,8] with
good sensitivity and speciﬁcity with the help of the head-up tilt (HUT) [9],
that oﬀers optimal hints also for the pathophysiology hypotheses. During this
test the patient, positioned on a self-moving table, after an initial rest period
in horizontal (basal) position, is suddenly brought in vertical (hortostatic)
position. In such a way the ANS registers a sudden stimulus of reduction of
arterial pressure due to the shift of blood volume to inferior limbs. A wrong
response to this stimulus can induce syncope behavior.

According to some authors, the positivity of HUT means an individual predis-
position toward vasovagal syncope [10]. This statement does not ﬁnd a general
agreement because of the low reproducibility of the test [11] in the same pa-
tient and the extreme variability of the sensitivity in most of the clinical stud-

2

ies [8]. In last years a large piece of work has been devoted to the investigation
of signal patterns that could characterize syncope-aﬀected patients. This has
been done especially by means of mathematical analyses of arterial pressure
and heart rate. The spectral analysis (by means of Fast Fourier Transform
algorithms and similar approaches) is a powerful tool to study the frequency
composition of biological signals, but it shows some limits and does not always
permit to achieve clear conclusions and interpretations [12]. One of the main
results obtained in studies on humans and animals adopting these techniques,
is that two particular frequency peaks are always distinguishable and to both
of them has been attributed a speciﬁc physiological meaning in connection
with sympathetic and vagal nervous control. Actually, at this stage, there is
not a wide agreement even about the physiological origin of such peaks, and
diﬀerent attempts to characterize typical patterns to discriminate between
patients fainting to the HUT and healthy people, have failed [13].

In this paper we perform, by means of DWT, a new, detailed analysis of blood
pressure waves of healthy people (controls) and syncope aﬀected patients (pos-
itives) with the main intent to highlight all possible diﬀerences. The positivity
of examined patients has been clinically established after a long and careful
observation and also results in consequence of repeated HUT tests.
We have succeeded in this task so providing a potential diagnostic method for
an early detection of this syndrome.

The most striking diﬀerence between Fourier and DWT decomposition is that
the last allows for a projection on modes simultaneously localized in both time
and frequency space, up to the limit of classical uncertainty relations. Unlike
the Fourier bases, which are delocalized for deﬁnition, the DWT bases have
limited spatial support so being particularly useful for the study of signals
which are known only inside a limited temporal window. For our study, DWT
has been shown to be a powerful tool for putting in evidence some “hidden”
features of the signal we examine that are very diﬃcult to be detected with a
direct study of Fourier power spectra. So, in a sense, in our investigation, DWT
acts as a microscope allowing us to magnify signal’s characteristics otherwise
not easily visible.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we will give a short mathe-
matical introduction to Haar wavelet analysis with the aim of writing down
the formulas that are used in the subsequent sections. In Section 3 the inves-
tigation methods and the results obtained studying blood pressure waves are
fully explained in order to ﬁnd some vasovagal syncope distinctive features.
In Section 4 we develop further data manipulations and ﬁnally we draw our
conclusions in Section 5.

2 The Haar wavelet analysis

As told above, in the present paper we will not give a comprehensive introduc-
tion to wavelet mathematics, reporting only a brief account of its aspects that
are relevant for our objectives and referring the reader, interested in further
understanding, to a vast literature on the subject [14].

The Haar wavelet is historically the ﬁrst basis that has been introduced for
wavelet analysis and for many practical purposes it is the simplest to be used
in applications.
Let us consider a function f (x), deﬁned in [0, L], representing some data (below
we will consider the systolic/diastolic pressure height taken at diﬀerent times).
This function is typically known with some ﬁnite resolution ∆x and it can be
represented as an histogram having 2m bins in such a way that:

L
2m ≥ ∆x.

Each bin is labeled by an integer n running from 0 to 2m − 1. We can now
deﬁne:

fm,n(x) = f (x), x ∈ [

L
2m n,

L
2m (n + 1)].

Obviously holds the relation:

f (x) =

fm,n(x)φ(

x − n) = f (m)(x),

(3)

2m−1

Xn=0

where the function φ is deﬁned in such a way that:

φ(s) = 


0

if 0 ≤ s ≤ 1

elsewhere

.

(2)

(4)

By writing f (m)(x) we mean “f looked at scale m”. Let us consider now a
roughening of f (m):

f (m−1)(x) =

fm−1,n(x)φ(

x − n),

2m−1

where, as it is very easy to check, we have:

fm−1,n(x) =

(fm,2n(x) + fm,2n+1(x)).

(6)

It is clear that f (m−1)(x) contains less information than f (m)(x), so, in order to
recover the information that has been lost, we should be able to calculate the
diﬀerence function f (m)(x) − f (m−1)(x). We will call this diﬀerence function
W (m−1)(x). It can be shown (see [14]) that:

W (m−1)(x) =

Wm−1,n(x)ψ(

x − n),

(7)

2m−1−1

Xn=0

2m−1

Wm−1,n(x) =

(Wm,2n(x) − Wm,2n+1(x)),

where:

if 0.5 ≤ s ≤ 1

ψ(s) = 

being ψ(s) zero outside of the indicated intervals.
This is properly the main ingredient of the Haar wavelet decomposition. φ and
ψ are respectively known as mother and father functions and the coeﬃcients
fm,n, Wm,n are the mother and father (or wavelet) coeﬃcients. Mother and
father functions, taken together, generate a compactly supported orthogonal
basis .
According to our deﬁnition of diﬀerence function, it is straightforward to ob-
serve that:

f (m)(x) = f (0)(x) + W (0)(x) + ...... + W (m−1)(x).

(10)

Analyzing a signal which oscillates around an average value we realize that,
for all practical purposes, f (0)(x) = 0, so we immediately argue that:

f (x) =

Wj,n(x)ψ(

x − n),

(11)

m−1

2j −1

Xj=0

Xn=0

L

where summing on all m’s corresponds to looking at function f at all possible
scales. This is the wavelet representation of f (x) provided by the Haar basis.

5

What we learn is that the diﬀerence functions W enable us to project the
function f (x) on a new basis set. Furthermore, the orthogonality properties
of mother and father function allow us to write down the coeﬃcients of the
Discrete Wavelet Transform. A particular choice of normalization gives us:

Wm,n = 2−m′/2

fiψ(2−m′

i − n),

(12)

where m′ = 10 − m being L = 210 the total number of pressure wave maxima
fi constituting the histogram function that we want to study. So it is clear
that, substituting m′ → m, we have:

W10−m,n = 2−m/2

fiψ(2−mi − n).

(13)

Let us call W10−m,n = W ′
m,n in the following. The variability of the wavelet
coeﬃcients for each pressure wave has been parameterized at the diﬀerent
scales (diﬀerent values of m) by means of their standard deviations:

σ(m) =

where N is the number of wavelet coeﬃcients at a given scale m (N = L/2m).

3 Blood pressure waves

In the previous section we introduced the technical tools that we will use
in our analysis of blood pressure waves. Basically, all we need for our pur-
poses is the expression of the ﬂuctuation in Eq. (14). Our main results are in
fact obtained examining plots of scale m versus σ(m) in which the function
f (x) gives the height of maxima of systolic/diastolic blood pressure waves of
healthy and syncope-aﬀected patients recorded in basal position. The record-
ing period, before the tilting, is twenty minutes long. During this time the
following biological signals of the subject are recorded: E.C.G. (eﬀected in
D-II), E.E.G., the thoracic breath, the arterial blood pressure (by means of a
system ﬁnapres 2300 Ohmeda Co. USA, applied to a ﬁnger of the left hand).
The variable x is a time variable. We assume that the time interval separat-
ing two pressure maxima is, in normal conditions, almost equal to a certain
average value that we could establish case by case.
Of course diﬀerent individuals have diﬀerent average values of pressure so their

Fig. 1. Standard deviations of the wavelet coeﬃcients (see Eq. (14)) of the Systolic
Basal Pressure in syncope-aﬀected patients (positive) and healthy people (control).
Note the quite evident separation among positives and controls at m = 5 marked
by the short solid line.

blood wave signal has a diﬀerent average height, but a similar shape. What
we have really care of is the variation of height between neighboring pressure
maxima and not their absolute height values. Wavelet analysis looks exactly
where we want to look. In fact it is not diﬃcult to realize that, in Haar basis,
wavelet coeﬃcients are rescaled derivatives of the function being analyzed. If
we have two oscillating functions similar in shape but with two diﬀerent aver-
age height values, we could say that these functions are diﬀerent by a constant,
so this diﬀerence, induced by reasons external to what we really want to study,
is soon removed by computing the wavelet coeﬃcients and ﬂuctuations.
In order to understand better the role of the height variations between pres-
sure maxima with respect to the absolute value of each single height we also
perform speciﬁc analyzes. We will come back on this point in Section 4.
Looking at Fig. 1 it seems that there is a particularly clear distinction between
healthy people and patients having a syncope clinical behavior (established
after a long clinical observation period). This distinction appears traced in
correspondence of m = 5 scale value where we can observe a tendency of σ’s

7

related to positives to be lower than σ’s related to controls. For smaller values
of m there is no sensitive distinction between controls and positives, while,
for bigger values our analysis begins to be less and less signiﬁcant due to the
narrowness of our temporal observation window.
If we interpret this analysis as a possible discriminating test, we observe that it
has a sensitivity of 90% and a speciﬁcity of 78%. These empirical observations
have been subject of a further study focused to understanding why m = 5
is the relevant discriminating scale or possibly the onset of a discriminating
region between controls and positives.
The result of this investigation is that m = 5 separation corresponds to the
fact that positives must have in their Fourier power spectrum, relative to
the above-mentioned pressure signal, a “hidden” suppression of a certain low
frequency range (roughly centered around 0.02 ÷ 0.03 Hz, being m = 5 the
resolution window corresponding to about 25 pressure maxima) that is not
easily detectable looking only at Fourier spectra. What we just want to stress
here is how wavelet analysis has helped us to ﬁnd this feature.
One of the main drawback of wavelets with respect to Fourier bases, besides
their greater technical complication, is a less immediate physical meaning.
On the other hand there are well known mathematical expressions connecting
wavelet and Fourier coeﬃcients of the same function [14], but, again, many
computational diﬃculties have to be faced if one wants to implement these
formulas. Anyway, with a few straightforward and qualitative arguments, it is
possible to immediately ﬁgure out a frequency spectrum interpretation of the
m = 5 separation.
If one simply tries to calculate, with the help of a computer, Haar wavelet
coeﬃcients Wm,n of a sinus (or cosinus) function using Eq. (12), he will soon
realize that what is obtained are derivatives of sinus (or cosinus) rescaled on
the x-axis. Passing from an m value to the next m + 1 value, a derivative
is made and x units are scaled by a dilation factor a < 1. This means that,
passing from an m to the next, the sinusoidal function will have a greater
ﬂuctuation over the zero average value (the area below the curve must remain
the same after the rescaling of coordinates).
According to what has just been said, a low frequency sinusoidal function,
with a small weight coeﬃcient, will start ﬂuctuating in a considerable way
only going up with m values.
As known from Fourier analysis, each function, under very general conditions,
can be written down as a sum of weighted sinusoidal functions. If we take
two functions diﬀering in their Fourier coeﬃcient values only in a certain low
frequency common range and if we calculate their σ(m) for diﬀerent m’s, we
expect that the function having the smaller weight coeﬃcients in the low fre-
quency domain will also have the smaller σ values, for certain particular m
values, with respect to the other. For greater m’s, the depressed low frequency
harmonics begin to ﬂuctuate in a more sensitive way, so that we can foresee
again a decreasing in the diﬀerences between σ(m) values belonging to the
two functions having diﬀerent low frequency weights.

Fig. 2. As in Fig. 1 but for the Diastolic Basal Pressure.

With this simple picture in mind we soon understand that (see Fig. 1), since
positives appear to have smaller σ(5) with respect to controls and, since in
the above explained context m = 5 is a suﬃciently high value, then positives
are expected to have some low frequency depression in their Fourier spectrum
relative to the blood pressure wave signal.

An analysis similar to that carried out for Systolic Pressure waves has been
performed for Diastolic Pressure waves belonging to the same patients and
healthy subjects. As it is shown in Fig. 2, a clear evidence of separation be-
tween controls and positives is lost even if, at m = 5, controls tend to accu-
mulate towards higher σ-values than positives. This loss of sensitivity may be
due to the shorter variability range of the wavelet coeﬃcients of the Diastolic
Pressures with respect to the Systolic ones, as can be extrapolated looking at
the small values of the σ’s in Fig. 2 than those in Fig. 1.

sure after the application of a ﬁlter to the temporal series (see the text).

4 Data manipulations

First of all we want to follow a ﬁlter-technique used in [2] in order to improve
the clearness of our results. As one can see from Fig. 3, we do not succeed
in obtaining a better separation between control and positive data points, so
concluding that the method, seeming very eﬀective in [2], probably deserves
a further attention if it is to be used successfully for the manipulation of the
kind of data we are examining.
What is done is the following: the temporal series is reconstructed using the
set of its own wavelet coeﬃcients after a manipulation consisting in putting
all Wm,n with m diﬀerent from s equal to zero (see Fig. 3). The reconstruction
is obviously obtained through a wavelet antitrasformation. Then we evaluate
σf which is simply the standard deviation of this new reconstructed temporal
series. We neither obtain a very encouraging increasing in the gap between
positives and controls nor observe the opening of a gap region as in [2]. For
this reason, at least in this work, we do not push further this kind of analysis.

computed after a randomly reordering of the pressure wave maxima.

The second test we perform on our data is aimed to put in evidence the
importance of the temporal evolution of the pressure maxima heights with
respect to their magnitude. If we simply put in a diﬀerent temporal succession
the same initial data, as it is done in Fig. 4, we lose the somehow discriminating
behavior of Fig. 1, so arguing that the information, able to create a certain gap
between positives and controls, mostly comes from the temporal disposition
of maxima.

5 Conclusions and perspectives

We are aware that the analysis here suggested is far to be used as an operative
diagnosing method of vasovagal syncope but we show that it strongly suggests
(with its 90% sensitivity) a direction to look at. We think that with more
careful and longer-period data recording techniques this task could be easily
achieved.
Moreover we ﬁnd meaningful that also our contribution puts in evidence the

11

capability of wavelet analysis to give new insights going beyond those provided
by Fourier analysis in the context of such problems at frontier between physics
and pathophysiology.
Many considerations of pathophysiologic nature may be done about previous
results, but we think these deserve an appropriate work.

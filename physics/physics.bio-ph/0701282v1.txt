Summary. Water oﬀers a large temperature domain of stable liquid, and the char-
acteristic hydrophobic eﬀects are ﬁrst a consequence of the temperature insensitivity
of equation-of-state features of the aqueous medium, compared to other liquids. On
this basis, the known aqueous media and conditions oﬀer low risk compared to alter-
natives as a matrix to which familiar molecular biological structures and processes
have adapted. The current molecular-scale understanding of hydrophobic hydration
is not conformant in detail with a standard structural entropy rationalization. That
classic pictorial explanation may serve as a mnemonic, but isn’t necessary. A more
defensible view is that peculiar hydrophobic eﬀects can be comprehended by exam-
ination of engineering parameters characterizing liquid water. LA-UR-05-3081

1 Heuristic identiﬁcation of solvent systems alternative
to water as a matrix of life

The title of this discussion is a question that hints at a practical interest
in identifying alternative media for biomolecular processes and structures. In

addition there is the curiosity to understand precisely the special role that
water plays in known biochemistry and biophysics. Thus, we would like to
understand the specialness of liquid water as a matrix of life [1–3] well enough
to identify close comparisons, and we would like to identify close comparisons
in order to reﬁne our understanding of the specialness of water as a matrix of
life.

We are encouraged to embark on this discussion now because theories
of hydrophobic eﬀects — universally viewed as an essential feature of aque-
ous biochemistry and biophysics — have become more serious over the past
decade [4, 5]. For many more years than that there have standard views of
hydrophobic eﬀects [6, 7] that center on tetrahedrality as a feature of the lo-
cal structure of liquid water, and upon entropic contributions associated with
constraints on the structure that might be imposed by hydrophobic solutes.
That tetrahedrality concept, however, has been ineﬀective in identifying al-
ternatives. It is deﬁned on the basis of known structures of liquid water, and
then typically leads to a view that there is no water but water.

Here we will refer to the classic views of hydrophobic eﬀects based upon
that tetrahedrality concept as pictorial theories because those words were
used initially [8], and because those views often don’t proceed to a quan-
titative stage of molecular science. The recent progress on the problems of
hydrophobic eﬀects [4, 5, 9–17] lead in a diﬀerent direction from the classic
pictorial theories. The new direction avoids speculations on structurally spe-
ciﬁc molecular mechanisms, and instead focuses on engineering characteristics
— such as the equation of state of the liquid water matrix — in building a
theoretical description.

From the perspective of that recent progress, the pictorial theories that
are side-stepped are rationalizations typical of subtle but vital chemical prob-
lems. Though the alternative direction avoids simple rationalization to achieve
a fully defensible theory, it also leaves open the sources of the necessary in-
formation. We use the context of this discussion to collect some results on
solvents that might oﬀer natural alternatives to liquid water for astrobiology.
A striking feature of the biophysical structures that we know is that spatial
organization is achieved by competing hydrophilic and hydrophobic interac-
tions [18]. It is natural then to expect that an eﬀective alternative matrix for
life should support both solvophobic and solvophilic interactions. We com-
ment on each of these issues in turn.

1.1 Hydrophobic eﬀects

The most primitive conceptualization of hydrophobic eﬀects is just that water
and oil don’t mix [16, 19]. These phase equilibria, together with molecular-
scale hydrophobic-hydrophilic amphiphilicity, result in spatially segregated
mesoscropic structures with obvious utilities [18]. The driving force for oil-
water phase separation is customarily viewed as a sticky interaction operating

What is special about water?

between hydrophobic species [20, 21], but not as speciﬁcally as suggested by
the archaic term ‘hydrophobic bond.’

This phase equilibrium alone is not, however, the most challenging aspect
of the puzzle of hydrophobic eﬀects. Standard solution thermodynamic studies
establish that the suggested hydrophobic stickiness becomes stronger as the
temperature increases. This point is experimentally clear in the phenomenon
of cold-denaturation of proteins wherein cool, unfolded soluble proteins fold
upon heating [22–25]. Another example of this behavior is shown in Fig. 1.

[26]; see [27].

It is inevitable that organized mesoscopic solution structures should come
apart at suﬃciently high temperatures. The fact that hydrophobic — stabiliz-
ing — interactions should become stronger with increasing temperature then
stabilizes those structures over a broader range of temperatures than if this
peculiar temperature behavior of hydrophobic interactions didn’t obtain. The
temperature at which this increase of hydrophobic attraction ceases is known
as the entropy convergence temperature, and is in the neighborhood of 130 C
at moderate pressures; the upper-temperature limit of known life is in the
neighborhood of 120 C [28], so classic hydrophobic interactions get stronger
throughout that upper range of temperatures.

At the observed lower end of the temperature domain for metabolite ac-
tivity, perhaps near −20 C [29, 30], hydrophobic stabilization of enzymes is
expected to be more delicate [31]. Though other conditions may not be entirely
the same in such a comparison, the systems of initial interest are predomi-
nately aqueous systems in the temperature range is −20 C < T < 120 C.

The idea followed here is that this is a large temperature range. Finding
alternative solvents that might approach a temperature range this large is not
expected to be easy.

A large temperature range is expected to be important because a living
organism is likely to require a multitude of physical and chemical processes
each with some temperature sensitivity. Optimization of individual such pro-
cesses should be seen as secondary to satisfactory compromises of performance
among many processes. An alternative medium that oﬀers a wide range of pos-
sibilities for such compromises should be a preferred choice as an alternative
for the known matrix of life.

Viewed contrapositively, a medium in which a signiﬁcant fraction of re-
quired processes could be seriously degraded by a thermal excursion would
not be expected to be a satisfactory matrix of life. Then the temperature
maxima and minima that abound in physical properties of aqueous solutions
— the maximum of the density in the liquid is one example, and the minimum
in the compressibility shown in Fig. 4 is another example — the signiﬁcance
of these maxima and minima is ﬁrst that the properties of liquid water have
a small net variation in an extended temperature range.

1.2 Hydrophilic eﬀects

If traditional hydrocarbon-dominated organic molecules are the carriers of one
of those categories of interaction, that seems to leave classic electrostatic and
chemical interactions for the other category [15]. Indeed, water is a chemically
active liquid. Water is involved in standard acid-base chemistry, both through
direct molecular participation, and indirectly by auto-ionization:

+ H+

This underlies the buﬀering that is essential to familiar biochemistry, and
moderates changes in charge states of soluble macromolecules. Fig. 2 shows

signiﬁcantly with increasing temperature along the saturation curve as both

In the context of protein folding studies some years ago, Klotz [32] drew
attention to the fact that pKA of simple carboxylic acids show extrema curi-
ously similar to the others we have been discussing; this is exhibited in Fig. 2.
Familiar aqueous biochemistry exploits standard acid-base chemistry and
mobile ions in solution. For example, the interiors of cells have a negative
electrical potential relative to the exterior. This is because electrical potential
diﬀerences couple to proton shuttling and ATP synthesis. Regulated electrical
communication seems necessary. Mobile ionic solutes serve that purpose.

Ionic dissolution and dissociation in liquid water is associated with its high
dielectric constant. Fig. 3 shows that this dielectric constant is above 50 for
temperatures below 120 C; these are high values, and so high that the variation
of ε0 in the liquid phase here is not a dominating concern. Relative variations
of hydration free energies will depend on δε0/ε0. The observed high-values
of the dielectric constant means that salts are satisfactorily soluble in liquid
water, and that good solubility will not be critically sensitive to variations of
solvent quality. Dissolution of minerals extends the (T, p) domain of the liquid
phase.

Liquids with dielectric constants as high as those of liquid water are not

usual; results for a selection of such cases are shown in Fig. 3.

2 Current theory of hydrophobic eﬀects

Why should hydrophobic attractions become stronger at higher temperatures?
This has always been a contentious issue for molecular theories [42, 43]. But
a rationalization based upon a structural mechanism has always been stan-
dard [6]: water molecules contacting hydrophobic groups are considered to
be ordered, suﬀering an entropy penalty [44]. When hydrophobic groups are
buried by phase segregation or folding, contacting water molecules are released
to the bulk, regaining the penalized entropy. The demixed or folded case has
a higher entropy for that reason, and is the stable outcome at higher tem-
peratures. Viewed in the opposite temperature direction, this suggests that
cold-denaturation works by water molecules prying-open folded, soluble pro-
tein molecules [45].

This entropy rationalization might have a fractional truth. But it has never
been developed in a conclusive way and proved. An appreciation of this gap
between molecular theories and common rationalizations seems to be growing
more widely [46].

Furthermore, experimental counter-examples are readily available, simple,
and troubling. A particularly clear counter-example is due to Friedman &
Krishnan [47]: the sum of the standard hydration entropies of K+(aq) and
Cl−(aq) is about twice the standard hydration entropy of Ar(aq). The case

Fig. 3. Upper: the static dielectric constant of ﬂuid water along the liquid-vapor
coexistence curve [36], and liquid methanol [37] and liquid ammonia [38]. The blue
dotted curves are ﬁtted models ∝ ρliq/T , suggesting that the qualitative behavior is
simply understood on the basis of equation of state variables. Measurement of the
dielectric constant of liquid H2S as a function of temperature has been sketchy; but
the value at its normal freezing point, about 9.3, gives a typical magnitude. The
static dielectric constant of liquid ammonia is about 23 for the lowest temperature
liquid state. Lower: Static dielectric constants as a function of T at ambient pressures
for several high-dielectric-constant liquids; see [39]. Hydrogen cyanide might be the
highest-dielectric-constant molecular liquid, but with the most rapid decrease with
T through these thermodynamic states [40]. The electrical conductivity of HCN is
lower than that of liquid water. Formamide has a higher dielectric constant than
liquid water here, and that dielectric constant doesn’t decrease faster than does the
dielectric constant of water [41]. A variety of amides, and also urea and thiourea,
are likely to exhibit similarly high dielectric constants. Liquids with static dielectric
constants above 30 are fairly common, and some of those cases are shown.

of methanol as solvent is qualitatively diﬀerent. If hydrophobic eﬀects are
conceptualized on the basis of hydration entropies and speciﬁc hydration
structures, this is paradoxical: according to the measured entropies Ar(aq)
+ Ar(aq) is about as hydrophobic as K+(aq) + Cl−(aq), but the hydration
structures neighboring K+(aq), Cl−(aq), and Ar(aq) are clearly qualitatively
diﬀerent, both in structures observed and numbers of water molecules aﬀected.
A speculation how this might happen was oﬀered recently [48], but couldn’t
be considered yet proved.

This example should not be interpreted to suggest that K+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
is hydrophobic. The point is that the classic entropy rationalization is not a
necessary explanation why Ar(aq) is hydrophobic.

The proved theories of classic hydrophobic eﬀects [4, 5, 7, 9] — leaving
aside the cases of ionic solutes or of hydrophobic eﬀects in the context of
amphiphilic solutes — establish something more subtle and more general than
the structural entropy rationalization discussed above: the entropic eﬀects that
are characteristic of hydrophobic phenomena are closely tied to peculiarities
of the equation of state of liquid water. This is the engineering perspective
that we noted at the outset of this discussion.

2.1 Equation-of-state features that govern primitive hydrophobic
eﬀects

Fig. 4 then grounds our description of these engineering aspects of the present
problem [7, 16]. The Upper-left panel there shows measured compressibilities
for liquid water and several organic solvents. Water is qualitatively stiﬀer.
Current theory [4, 5] suggests that the low solubility of inert gases in liquid
water is ﬁrst a reﬂection of this stiﬀness. Notice that this stiﬀness is only
weakly sensitive to temperature along the vapor saturation curve, in contrast
to the stronger temperature dependence of the compressibilities of the other
solvents.

Compressibilities of 150 liquids at ambient conditions of T = 298.15 K and
p = 1 bar were surveyed in [53]. In that collection, liquid water does indeed
have a low compressibility; glycerol had the lowest compressibility in that
listing. Working from lowest compressibilities upward those liquids are ordered
as glycerol, diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, formamide, 2-aminoethanol, 1-4
butanediol, 1-5 pentanediol, and water, with the last two noted cases tied. This
ordering suggests that all of the named liquids would be of interest for further
study in an astrobiology context. Formamide not only is less compressible
than liquid water, it also has a compressibility minimum near 25 C at low
pressure [54].

The Lower-left panel of Fig. 4 makes a similar comparison of the thermal
expansions of our standard organic solvents along the saturation curve. We
are principally interested in the circumstances that the density decreases with
increasing temperature, but that decrease is qualitatively slower for liquid wa-
ter than for the other solvents shown. Current theory [7, 16] suggests that the

inverse of the thermal expansion coeﬃcient − (∂T /∂ ln ρ)σ should be con-
sidered a characteristic temperature for hydrophobic hydration; in the most
fortunate cases [7, 16], it is — roughly but clearly — a small multiple of the
entropy convergence temperature observed experimentally with the solubilities
of inert gases in water [55, 56]. Where this entropy convergence behavior is
well-developed, the entropy convergence temperature is the temperature at
which the hydrophobic stickiness stops increasing in strength with increasing
temperature. Following the interpretation of − (∂T /∂ ln ρ)σ as an important
temperature scale, that temperature — see Fig. 4 — is higher for liquid water
than for the other solvents shown.

It is often guessed that the surface tensions associated with water in-
terfaces should be involved in the description of hydrophobic eﬀects [7, 57].
A nice way to consider what might be the implications of liquid-vapor in-
terfacial tensions, γlv, is to consider the product γlv × (∂ ln ρ/∂p)T ; this is
a reduced correlation length [7, 49], and is shown for the same cases in the
Upper-right panel of Fig. 4. For the organic solvents the tensions decrease and
the compressibilities increase with increasing temperature. In those cases, the
compressibility-increases dominate, and the correlation lengths increase. For
liquid water, in contrast, the compressibility scarcely changes, and the inter-
facial tension decreases with increasing temperature. Thus, this correlation
length decreases with increasing temperature. Recent theories suggest that
a multiple — roughly a factor of ten — of this reduced correlation length
identiﬁes a length-scale on which macroscopic considerations can be directly
exploited in proved theories [7].

There are two points of interpretation of the results for the reduced corre-
lation length. The ﬁrst point is that though liquid water has a relatively high
interfacial tension with its vapor, when viewed in this scale the magnitudes are
not unusual. It is the temperature dependence that is unusual, and that un-
usual temperature dependence is mostly associated with the compressibility.
The second point of interpretation is that the contraction of this correlation
length with increasing temperature naturally would be viewed as a break-
down of the more open architecture of liquid water at lower temperatures.
This correlation length is apparently a sensitive diagnostic of this break-down
behavior; the more detailed current theory also predicts a contraction with
increasing temperature of a corresponding natural length scale [7].

The ﬁnal frame of Fig. 4, Lower-right, shows the internal pressure, (∂U/∂V )T .

≈ aρ2, with a the van der Waals
Following a van der Waals model (∂U/∂V )T
parameter describing the eﬀects of attractive intermolecular interactions on
the equation of state. This contribution stabilizes the liquid at low pressure.
Water is clearly qualitatively diﬀerent from the organic solvents in this re-
spect. Because of the expectation of a van der Waals model, the behavior
seen for liquid water might suggest that this liquid is becoming better bound
at higher temperatures, deﬁnitely counter-intuitive and a paradoxical view.

This example illustrates how a counter-intuitive temperature dependence

can arise. This internal pressure can be expressed as

where αp ≡ − (∂ ln ρ/∂T )p here is quantitatively only slightly diﬀerent from
the ασ of Fig. 4, and the compressibility κT was deﬁned there also. For the
case of liquid water, κT is small, and since αp is also comparatively small the
density changes are small. The change of κT with T is thus also small, the ratio
αp/κT is, above 4 C, then a substantial factor with weak T dependence, and
the p contribution of Eq. (2) is a secondary magnitude. The formal multiplier
of T in Eq. (2) then causes a steep increase with increasing temperature. Thus
the literal description of the counter-intuitive behavior is that with increasing
temperature

1. the density is decreasing but only slowly,
2. the low compressibility is scarcely changing,
3. and the kinetic energy — the explicit factor of T — is increasing.

This combination produces the counter-intuitive result which is still an amaz-
ing trick, but at least somewhat clearer. The counter-intuitive temperature
dependences of hydrophobic eﬀects such as that shown in Fig. 1 eventually
acquire a practically identical explanation [4, 14]. Consequently, simple the-
ories of hydrophobic eﬀects that incorporate equation-of-state information
properly — and scarcely anything else — can be qualitatively correct in de-
scribing many of these unusual temperature dependences.

Note that this distinctive temperature dependence continues to tempera-

tures near the currently known upper-temperature limit of life.

2.2 Water compared to other possibilities

We can take a broader view of these characteristics of liquid water by com-
parison with some other ﬂuids that might be considered in the context of
astrobiology. Fig. 5 shows phase diagrams for a selection of interesting cases.
The oft-noted point that water has a high critical temperature compared to
other small molecule liquids is emphasized by these results. That critical tem-
perature is well above the temperatures of ﬁrst interest here, so it is probably
not speciﬁcally relevant. But water achieves this high critical temperature
by exhibiting a relatively long temperature domain for the liquid phase; and
then the density of liquid water decreases comparatively slowly with increasing
temperature. This is consistent with the results of Fig. 4.

3 Discussion

In view of the intricate beauty of molecular bioscience, a common attitude is
the biomolecular structures and processes are delicately tuned to the aque-
ous medium and conditions we know. The discussion here suggests that the

Fig. 5. Liquid-vapor coexistence densities for several ﬂuids compared to liquid wa-
ter; from [58] except for the methylamine case which comes from [59]. The vertical
axis is the density relative to the critical density in each case. The temperature
domain of the liquid water phase is larger than the other cases here. The variation
of the density of liquid water is slower than the other cases, consistent with Fig. 4.

familiar molecular biology has adapted to the known medium and conditions
that oﬀer low risk compared to alternatives. Water oﬀers a large temperature
domain of stable liquid, and the characteristic hydrophobic eﬀects are ﬁrst
correlated with the temperature insensitivity of engineering properties of the
aqueous medium, compared to other liquids.

This suggests that molecular biological structures and processes often
could be isolated to function satisfactorily in alternative milieu. But it is
likely that the conditions would require more careful control than in the orig-
inal aqueous setting. Transplanting successively more biochemical processes
to function satisfactorily at the same time in the same alternative milieu and
conditions naturally should be considered as increasingly hazardous.

4 Conclusions

The current molecular-scale understanding of hydrophobic hydration is not
conformant in detail with a standard structural entropy rationalization. That
standard pictorial explanation may serve as a mnemonic, but isn’t necessary. A
more defensible view is that peculiar hydrophobic eﬀects can be comprehended
by examination of engineering parameters characterizing liquid water. This is
even simpler than the standard pictorial theory.

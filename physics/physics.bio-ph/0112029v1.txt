Abstract

We introduce a model of DNA sequence evolution which can account for biases in mutation
rates that depend on the identity of the neighboring bases. An analytic solution for this class
of non-equilibrium models is developed by adopting well-known methods of nonlinear dynam-
ics. Results are presented for the CpG-methylation-deamination process which dominates point
substitutions in vertebrates. The dinucleotide frequencies generated by the model (using em-
pirically obtained mutation rates) match the overall pattern observed in non-coding DNA. A
web-based tool has been constructed to compute single- and dinucleotide frequencies for arbi-
trary neighbor-dependent mutation rates. Also provided is the backward procedure to infer the
mutation rates using maximum likelihood analysis given the observed single- and dinucleotide
frequencies. Reasonable estimates of the mutation rates can be obtained very eﬃciently, using
generic non-coding DNA sequences as input, after masking out long homonucleotide subse-
quences. Our method is much more convenient and versatile to use than the traditional method
of deducing mutation rates by counting mutation events in carefully chosen sequences. More
generally, our approach provides a more realistic but still tractable description of non-coding
genomic DNA, and may be used as a null model for various sequence analysis applications.

Introduction

Models of DNA sequence evolution have generally treated sequences as collections of independently
evolving sites[1]. However, there is a substantial amount of evidence from sequence analysis and
studies of mutation rates[2] which suggests that the identities of neighboring bases can have a strong
inﬂuence on the types and rates of mutational events which occur at a given sequence position.
We brieﬂy review these types of evidence before describing a model which explicitly accounts for
neighbor-dependent mutations.

Biochemical studies in the early 1970s compared the pattern of dinucleotide odds ratios (dinu-
cleotide frequencies normalized for the base composition) or “general designs” of diﬀerent genomes
and diﬀerent fractions of genomic DNA[3, 4] and concluded that this pattern is a remarkably stable
property of a genome which is largely preserved in closely related genomes or in diﬀerent renatura-
tion rate fractions of the same genome, for example. Some two decades later, a signiﬁcant body of
sequence analysis work primarily by Karlin and coworkers[5, 6, 7] has elaborated and expanded on
these observations, showing that the pattern of dinucleotide relative abundance values (essentially

equivalent to the general design) constitutes a “genomic signature” in the sense that it is remark-
ably constant across diﬀerent parts of a genome and is generally similar between related organisms,
but quite diﬀerent between distantly related organisms. This latter ﬁnding has led to application of
this principle to phylogeny reconstruction and identiﬁcation of laterally transferred genes in both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Although quite promising, this line of work is open to the
criticism that there is no underlying theory for why a genome should possess a particular signature
or the mechanism by which signatures change over long periods of time. The model described here
may help to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting these and related observations. Our
analysis may also contribute to understanding of the mechanisms of DNA mutation and repair and
may help in the development of better methods for phylogenetic tree construction.

Possible factors relating to the genome signature include eﬀects related to DNA structure, base
stacking and thermodynamics as well as a variety of mutational factors. Since the genome signature
is particularly pronounced in non-coding sequences which are typically under much less selective
pressure than coding regions and evolve much more rapidly, it appears likely that “nonselective”
forces such as biases related to mutation, replication and DNA repair account for many of the
properties of the genome signature, especially in higher eukaryotic organisms with large genomes
containing mostly non-coding DNA and relatively small eﬀective population sizes. One of the most
common types of mutation in vertebrate genomes is CpG methylation followed by deamination and
mutation of CG/CG to TG/CA [8, 9]. For example, Wang et al.[10] found that single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms occur approximately tenfold more often at CpG dinucleotides than at other dinucleotides
in human genomic DNA, suggesting that this is by far the most common type of single base muta-
tion in humans. This is in agreement with the earlier ﬁnding by Batzer et. al.[11] and Hess et. al.[2]
that point substitutions occur 10 times more frequently at CpG sites compared to non-CpG sites.
Increased mutation rate associated with CpG methylation can explain at least qualitatively why CpG
dinucleotides have consistently extremely low relative abundance values in all vertebrate nuclear
genomes[6]. This eﬀect was recently exploited by Fryxell and Zuckerkandl[12] in their theory of the
origin of genomic isochores in mammals.

Here we consider a model for DNA sequence evolution which includes neighbor-dependent mu-
tation eﬀects. Eﬃcient computational tools are constructed to solve the model for arbitrary user-
speciﬁed mutation processes and rates. The main results are quantitative answers to (1) the long
term eﬀects of neighbor-dependent mutations on the base compositional structure of a genome,
and (2) the underlying mutation processes and rates given sequence data with dinucleotide cor-
relations. In principle, such a model should be able to account for the eﬀects of CpG-methylation
induced mutation and several other known contextual eﬀects on mutation rates. However, in order
to preserve the tractability of the model, certain other types of mutations which occur in nature
had to be ignored. For example mutations which change the lengths of DNA sequences (insertions
and deletions such as those caused by polymerase slippage) or more complex mutations such as
inversions or other large-scale rearrangements are not considered. Nevertheless, the current model
is a reasonable ﬁrst approximation to DNA sequence evolution in the absence of selection.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2, we introduce our model of sequence evolution
with neighbor-dependent mutation, and deﬁne the mutation rate matrices. In Sec. 3, we describe
the general scheme used to calculate the single and dinucleotide frequencies, and present the pat-
tern of dinucleotide odds ratio obtained for a particular example involving the CpG-methylation-
deamination process described above. We also present the backward analysis, where a maximum
likelihood approach is used to infer the mutation rates from the observed dinucleotide frequencies
within the conﬁnes of our model. A web server is made available to perform these calculations at
http://bioinfo.ucsd.edu/dinucleotides. In Sec. 4, we list some of a large number of studies
made possible by the method described here. Details of the method are relegated to the Appendix.

2 The Model

We consider a sequence of L nucleotides α1, α2, . . . , αL with αi ∈ {A, C, G, T}. The conﬁguration at
time t is denoted by ~α(t) = (α1(t), α2(t), . . . , αL(t) ). There are two types of mutation processes
allowed: (1) mutations of a single nucleotide αi → α′
i which occurs with a rate Qαα′ independent of
its neighbors, and (2) mutations of a pair of neighboring nucleotides αiαi+1 → α′
i+1 which occurs
with a rate Rαβα′β′. These rates are positive numbers and ﬁxed in time.

iα′

We start with an initial random sequence ~α(0). The dynamics of the model is Markovian. At
any time t, the sequence ~α(t) is updated in discrete time steps ∆t/L according to the following
update rules:

1. A position i is chosen at random between 1 and L;

2. The nucleotide αi from the sequence ~α(t) is mutated to α′

that all non-diagonal transition probabilities in Eqs. (1) and (2) are small (≪ 1). Then after L such
iterations, on average every base in the sequence ~α(t) is mutated with probability (Q + R) · ∆t,
corresponding to a net increment of time by ∆t. The above procedure is then repeated for a long
time1 until the stationary state is reached. Since the model is ergodic, the stationary state is unique.
We denote the probability to ﬁnd a conﬁguration ~α in the stationary state by P (~α).

P

We refer to rates Qαα′ and Rαβα′β′ collectively as the mutation matrix Q and R, respectively.
There are a total of 12 independent rates Qαα′ and 240 independent rates Rαβα′β′. Note that
in the special case of neighbor-dependent single nucleotide mutation, e.g., the CpG-methylation-
deamination process described in Sec. 1, R is given by a restricted form with Rαβα′β′ non-zero only
if α = α′ or β = β′. There are still 96 independent rates under this restriction. For non-coding
DNA sequences, mutations on the complementary DNA strand should generally occur at the same
rate as on the forward strand. We therefore expect a reverse complementary symmetry in the rates,
i.e., Qαβ = Qαβ, and Rαβγδ = Rβαδγ, where α denotes the complement of α, e.g. A = T. These
complementarity conditions reduce the number of independent parameters by another factor of
two. Note however that for the calculation to be presented below, it is not necessary to impose any
of these conditions on Q or R.

1Dynamical aspects of this evolution model will be discussed elsewhere[13].

3 Methods and Results

The subject of this study is the stationary probability distribution P (~α) for the mutation processes
characterized by the rates Q and R.
If each nucleotide position evolves independently of each
other, i.e., if R = 0, then the distribution factorizes, with P (~α) =
i P0(αi), where P0(α) is
given by the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of Q. However, for R 6= 0, the
bases in the sequence do not evolve independently and the stationary distribution is diﬃcult to
calculate. Instead, we focus on the single nucleotide frequencies (or the “base composition”) and
the dinucleotide frequencies, given by

respectively. An important motivation for computing these frequencies is that they are easily
measured from actual sequence data[5] and can thus be used for quantitative comparison with the
output of our model.

3.1 Forward analysis: Computation of nucleotide frequencies

Our ﬁrst goal is to compute the frequencies fα and fαβ in the stationary state for any set of
mutation rates Q and R. Exact solution of these quantities is still diﬃcult because in order to
compute the dinucleotide frequencies, one needs to know the trinucleotide frequencies fαβγ, etc.,
ending up with an inﬁnite hierarchy of equations. This is a frequently encountered problem in
coupled dynamical systems. Here we introduce an approximation procedure called the “two-cluster
approximation” which is well-known from nonlinear dynamics[14]. This procedure truncates the
hierarchy of equations, expressing the trinucleotide frequencies as a function of the single and
dinucleotide frequencies, i.e.,

(4)

fαβγ = fαβfβγ/fβ ,
and then solves for the dinucleotide frequencies simultaneously. The procedure gives the exact so-
lution if the stationary state of the mutation process R is a ﬁrst-order Markov chain; it is generally
very accurately as long as the sequence correlation in the stationary state is short-ranged. Compar-
ison of solutions obtained using this method with the best numerical estimate from Monte-Carlo
simulation yielded relative disagreement well below the 1% level; see below. Thus, for practical
purposes, we can regard the cluster approximation as generating “exact” results. The advantage
of using the cluster approximation (instead of Monte-Carlo simulation) is that the single and din-
ucleotide frequencies can be computed virtually instantaneously by numerically solving a set of
algebraic equations for arbitrary mutation matrices Q and R, i.e., without any constraints on the
rates. We have developed a web server at http://bioinfo.ucsd.edu/dinucleotides to perform
this calculation.

We will present our method here via a speciﬁc example, the CpG-methylation-deamination pro-
cess described in the introduction. This process is described by a single neighbor-dependent muta-
tion rate, i.e.

RCGCA = RCGTG = r

and Rαβγδ = 0 for all other nondiagonal entries. To make this example transparent, we also consider
a simpliﬁed version of the neighbor-independent mutation rate Q, adopting a single rate q for all
transitions and another rate p for all transversions, i.e.,

QAC = QCA = QAT = QTA = QCG = QGC = QGT = QTG = p .

QAG = QGA = QCT = QTC = q ,

For this simple case, the single and dinucleotide frequencies can be solved analytically in closed
form under the two-cluster approximation as described in the Appendix. Note that since the
stationary state does not involve any time scale in itself, the results only depend on two eﬀective
parameters, q/p and r/p. The transition/transversion ratio has been estimated to be q/p ≈ 3
previously, based on mammalian pseudogene studies[2, 15, 16, 17]. Combined with the observed
10-fold diﬀerence[2, 11] in point substitution counts between CpG and non-CpG sites [which implies
2(r + q) ≈ 10 × (2p + q)], we obtain r/q ≈ 20 for mammals. The nucleotide frequencies computed
according to these rates are shown in Table 1. They compare very well to the results of Monte-Carlo
simulation: the latter performed for an L = 108 system (and averaged over 100 simulations) yielded
results that were within an rms deviation of 10−5 in the single-nucleotide frequencies and 4 · 10−5
in the dinucleotide frequencies.

Table 1: Single and dinucleotide frequencies from the two-cluster approximation for q/p = 3 and
r/p = 20.

Let us examine the results presented in Table 1. First we note that the nucleotide composition
fα is skewed towards A and T, with a C+G content of 42%, which is in general agreement with the
typical average C+G content in mammals. Note that unlike most existing phylogenetic studies[1],
where the mutation rates Q are tuned to reproduce the observed frequencies. In our study, the
mutation matrix Q by itself would have generated equal C+G and A+T content, with the anomaly
coming solely from the CpG-methylation-deamination process. Similar observation was made by
Fryxell and Zuckerkandl[12] based on their Monte Carlo simulations.

Next, we analyze the dinucleotide frequencies. It is useful to focus on the dinucleotide odds
ratio, ραβ ≡ fαβ/(fαfβ), introduced to indicate whether a speciﬁc dinucleotide pair αβ is over-
(ραβ > 1) or under-represented (ραβ < 1) with respect to neighbor-independent mutation. The
results derived from the frequencies in Tables 1 are shown in Table 2 (left). For comparison, the
odds ratio ˆραβ obtained from the observed single and dinucleotide frequencies ˆfα and ˆfαβ for a
region of 4Mbp integenic DNA taken from the Human genome Chromosome 21 (Accession # NT
011512) is given in Table 2 (right). [We will denote each observed quantity by a “hat” throughout
the text.] The rms deviation between the observed ratio ˆραβ and the computed ραβ’s is 0.1. We
note that the computed ratios capture correctly the key feature of the observed data, i.e., a strong
under-representation of the CG dinucleotides, compensated by the over-representation of CA and TG.
At this stage of the analysis, we cannot expect a perfect match between the observed and the
computed frequencies in Table 2, since we used a very rough estimate on the rates q and r in the
computation. One can of course always tune q and r to match the computed odds ratios in CG and
CA/TG. But this is not suﬃcient for deducing the underlying mutation rates, since the CpG mutation
process introduced also aﬀects the other dinucleotide counts: As seen in Table 2 (left), our model
produces 9 other dinucleotides that are over- or under- represented by ∼ 10% each. They result from
secondary mutation since all these 9 pairs are only one point mutation away from CG, CA, or TG. Only
the four dinucleotides (AC, AT, GC, GT) that are two point mutations away are not aﬀected by the CpG
process. Note that the magnitude of the change in ραβ due to the primary mutation, as well as the
magnitude and sign of change in ραβ due to the secondary mutations could not have been anticipated

directly from the model deﬁned by Eqs. (5)–(7). Thus, the “backward analysis” of matching all of
the dinucleotide ratios (as well as the single nucleotide frequencies) by varying the rates q and r is a
highly nontrivial numerical task. Fryxell and Zuckerkandl[12] attempted to do this by focusing on
a few selected nucleotide frequencies (namely, CG, TG, TA and AT) which they obtained for diﬀerent
mutation rates using extensive Monte Carlo simulation. Their method is arbitrary, inaccurate and
very time consuming. With our approach, we can provide a systematic, accurate, and eﬃcient
method to perform the backward analysis as described below. Our method is implemented in a
server at the same url as provided above, http://bioinfo.ucsd.edu/dinucleotides .

3.2 Backward analysis: Estimation of mutation rates

Our next task is to estimate the mutation rates Q and R which best “explain” the observed data
as quantiﬁed by single and dinucleotide frequencies ˆfα and ˆfαβ. We will adopt the strategy of
maximum likelihood[18]. Speciﬁcally, we compute the likelihood L(Q, R) of observing the data
given our mutation model with the rates Q and R: First we note that the probability P (~α) of
observing a sequence ~α of length L is

P (~α) = fα1...αL ≈

(fαi−1αi/fαi)

L

Yi=2

according to the two-cluster approximation (see Eq. (4) and the Appendix). The likelihood of the oc-
α f L ˆfα
currence of a particular sequence with frequencies ˆfα and ˆfαβ is then given by (
yielding the following expression for the log-likelihood,

where fα and fαβ denote the single- and dinucleotide frequencies according to our model with rates
Q and R.

In principle, one can now search through all of the single-point mutation rates as embodied in
Q and all possible combinations of the neighbor-dependent mutation processes and their rates as
embodied in R to maximize L. However, this search space is much too large even given our solution.
More importantly, we do not want to have too many parameters to over-ﬁt the data. Thus, we
allow only a single transversion rate (which is set to 1 without loss of generality), two transition
rates, QAG = QTC and QCT = QGA (since a diﬀerence in those rates has already been reported in the
literature [19]), and one single neighbor-dependent mutation process. However, we do not limit the
latter to CpG and search through all of the 48 possibilities and their accompanying rates. If the

maximum-likelihood solution found is still not satisfactory, then an additional neighbor-dependent
process may be included to further improve the result.

To illustrate the backward analysis, we feed in the single and dinucleotide counts of the above
mentioned intergenic region of Human Chromosome 21. The best neighbor-dependent process
found by our program is the known process CpG → CpA or CpG → TpG. However, the transition
rates corresponding to the maximum likelihood solution are at the boundary of the region searched.
They are even smaller than the transversion rate p = 1, indicating that there is something wrong,
most likely a sign that the data contained some feature(s) not anticipated by our mutation model.
In order to get a hint at the source of the problem, we repeated the search allowing for an additional
neighbor-dependent mutation process which would bring the transition rates to the expected regime.
The program found the additional processes ApC → ApA or GpT → TpT; with these processes, the
maximum-likelihood solution for the mutation rates became more reasonable, with QAG = QTC =
3.10 p, QCT = QGA = 3.78 p, RCGCA = RCGTG = 43.02 p, and RACAA = RGTTT = 4.35 p. Since we are not
aware of any biological or biochemical evidence for the additional mutation processes ApC → ApA
or GpT → TpT, we interpret this result merely as an indication that the over-abundance of AA and
TT in the observed data (see Table 2) makes it diﬃcult to “explain” by the model with only the
CpG mutation process. (From the left panel of Table 2, it is clear that the CpG process only reduces
the odds ratio of AA and TT, while the observed trend is the opposite.)

What might be the source of this over-abundance? From an inspection of the length distribution
of the homonucleotide subsequences (Fig. 1), one sees an conspicuous over-abundance of long runs
of A’s or T’s. These long runs, while low in numbers, will clearly bias the dinucleotide counts.
However, their occurrences are thought to arise from sequence-speciﬁc insertion processes such
as polymerase slippage and have nothing to do with neighbor-dependent mutation being studied
here. In order to perform the backward analysis properly, it is therefore necessary to ﬁrst ﬁlter
out the eﬀect of such processes. The odds ratio ˆρ(ﬁlter) obtained after removing all homonucleotide
subsequences of length four or more are presented in Table 3 (left). Comparing it to Table 2 (right),
we see substantial (> 15%) decreases in the counts for AA, TT, CC, and GG as expected, as well as
> 10% increases in AT and TA. (The single nucleotide frequencies are however not aﬀected much by
the ﬁlter.) Applying the backward analysis on the ﬁltered data with a single neighbor-dependent

7

process, we recover the known CpG process again, but this time with the rates QAG = QTC = 1.75 p,
QCT = QGA = 2.33 p, and RCGCA = RCGTG = 22.17 p, which are all within the known range given
above. [Similar results were obtained when we ﬁltered out subsequences of length 5 or longer with
at least 80% of the same nucleotide. The rates found were QAG = QTC = 1.66 p, QCT = QGA = 2.03 p,
and RCGCA = RCGTG = 17.80 p.] The predicted odds ratio ρ∗ corresponding to these maximum-
likelihood rates are presented in Table 3 (right). The rms deviation between the ﬁltered data and
the maximum-likelihood prediction is 0.05 .

4 Discussion and Outlook

We have introduced a model of neighbor-dependent mutation and developed methods to study
these processes which are believed to play an important role in the evolution of genomic sequences.
We see that the base composition and the dinucleotide frequencies are strongly inﬂuenced by
neighbor-dependent mutation. This may contribute to the (surprising) success of phylogenetic
analysis based on dinucleotide counts[6, 7], since the pattern of dinucleotide frequencies reﬂect the
mutation mechanisms and rates which should be highly conserved throughout evolution. A similar
mutation model was investigated in the recent work of Fryxell and Zuckerkandl [12] using Monte
Carlo simulations. In that work, the backward analysis required a number arbitrary assumptions
and large amounts of computer time. Our work represents a systematic approach to these studies.
The analysis tools we provide enable the users to examine a large number of mutation processes
and rates in detail and over a large number of genomes, to look for previously unknown mutation
processes and track them across the diﬀerent kingdoms of life.

Of course, the mutation model (i.e., Eqs. (1) and (2)) and the assumption of stationarity for
observed sequences need to be veriﬁed quantitatively. But the present method is in fact not limited
to the study of the stationary state, and can be straightforwardly extended to describe the evolution
towards stationarity[13]. This can be used to extend the traditional phylogenetic analysis[1] to
include neighbor-dependent eﬀects, and should be particularly useful for the vertebrates which are
dominated by the CpG-methylation-deamination process. Finally we note that a more accurate
description of the evolution of non-coding genomic DNA sequences will be of value to various
sequence analysis applications, particularly those involving mammalian genomes. For instance, in
the comparative genomics approach to gene and DNA motif ﬁnding, one needs to evaluate the
probability of spurious matches due to shared common ancestry in the non-coding regions[20].
Accurate evaluation of such probabilities depend critically on having realistic models of sequence
evolution, which this study contributes towards.

Appendix: The Two-Cluster Approximation

To illustrate our method, we consider a speciﬁc example of the neighbor-dependent mutation pro-
cess, the CpG-methylation-deamination process mentioned in the introduction. A similar model has
[12]. Given the mutation processes de-
also been studied using Monte-Carlo simulations in Ref.
ﬁned by Eqs. (5), (6) and (7), the time evolution of the dinucleotide frequency fαβ can be expressed
in terms of the function fαβ and the trinucleotide frequency fαβγ only. It will be convenient to
take the continuum time limit, and turn the discrete dynamics described in Sec. 2 into diﬀerential
equations[21]. For example, the evolution of fAA is given by

∂
∂t

fAA = pfCA + qfGA + pfTA − (2p + q)fAA

+pfAC + qfAG + pfAT − (2p + q)fAA + rfCGA

(9)

where all terms on the right hand side correspond to processes either creating (positive signs) or
destroying (negative signs) an AA pair. In Eq. (9), the ﬁrst four terms result from point mutations
on the ﬁrst site, the second four from point mutations on the second site, as indicated by the
underlined letters. The last term proportional to r stems from a G turning into an A due to a
CG → CA process on the two sites shifted by one to the left. There are 16 such equations for the 16
dinucleotide frequencies.

As one can see in Eq. (9), the time evolution of the two-point functions depends in general on the
three-point functions fαβγ which in turn will depend on the four-point functions. To truncate this
hierarchy of equations, we apply a standard closure approximation used in non-linear dynamics[14]

i.e. we approximate the probability of ﬁnding three letters αβγ by the probability of ﬁnding a pair
αβ multiplied by the conditional probability of ﬁnding a pair βγ, given that the middle base is β;
the latter is expressed according to Bayes’s rule. The L-point function subsequently takes the form

Yi=2
The single nucleotide frequencies called for in Eqs. (10) and (11) can be expressed in terms of the
dinucleotide frequencies as

Thus, the right hand side of Eq. (9) can be written as a function of the fαβ’s only. We can generate
an equation similar to (9) for each of the 16 fαβ’s. Applying the approximation (10) and the
identity (12), we then obtain a closed system of coupled, nonlinear diﬀerential equations

with 16 Gαβ’s. In the stationary state, the functions fαβ(t) are independent of t and hence their
derivative with respect to t vanishes. To calculate the stationary fαβ’s, we therefore have to solve
the set of 16 (quadratic) equations, Gαβ(fAA, fAC, . . . , fTT) = 0, whose solution is straightforwardly
obtained with the help of Mathematica and given below:

It is convenient to express the results in term of the parameter

The single nucleotide frequencies are

∆ =

(3p + q)r
16(p + q)(3p + q) + 4(7p + 3q)r

fA = fT =

fC = fG =

.

Since ∆ is an increasing function of r with ∆(r = 0) = 0, we see that fA = fT > 1/4 for all positive
r’s.

The dinucleotide frequencies are most succinctly expressed in terms of the auxiliary functions

ˆfαβ ≡ fαβ − fαfβ. The results are:

ˆfCA =

∆(1 + ∆)

ˆfCC = −

ˆfCG = −

16r

(2∆ − 1)(4r∆2 + 8(2p + 2q + r)∆ − r)
32r(∆ − 1)

.

Additionally, we have

ˆfAC = ˆfAT = ˆfGC = ˆfGT = 0

since these four dinucleotides are two mutations away from the three primary pairs above, as
motivated already in Sec. 3.

The remaining 9 frequencies can now be obtained simply by exploiting the relation

ˆfαβ =
ˆfβα which follows from Eq. (12), and the reverse complementarity symmetry ˆfαβ = ˆfβα.

The results are:

ˆfCT = −( ˆfCA + ˆfCC + ˆfCG) ,

ˆfTC = − ˆfCC ,

ˆfTT = − ˆfCT,

ˆfAA = ˆfTT ,

ˆfAG = ˆfCT ,

ˆfGG = ˆfCC ,

ˆfTG = ˆfCA,

ˆfGA = ˆfTC ,
ˆfTA = −( ˆfAA + ˆfCA + ˆfGA).

As shown already in Sec. 3, this approximation gives very accurate results when compared to
Monte-Carlo simulations of the same system. This is due to the very short-ranged correlation
induced by the mutation process and will not be elaborated here.

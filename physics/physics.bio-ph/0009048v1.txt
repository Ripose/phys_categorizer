The theory of stochastic transcription termination based on free-energy competition1 requires two
or more reaction rates to be delicately balanced over a wide range of physical conditions. A large
body of work on glasses and large molecules suggests that this should be impossible in such a large
system in the absence of a new organizing principle of matter. We review the experimental literature
of termination and ﬁnd no evidence for such a principle but many troubling inconsistencies, most
notably anomalous memory eﬀects. These suggest that termination has a deterministic component
and may conceivably be not stochastic at all. We ﬁnd that a key experiment by Wilson and von
Hippel2 allegedly refuting deterministic termination was an incorrectly analyzed regulatory eﬀect
of Mg2+ binding.

I. INTRODUCTION

lem in mesoscopic physics and an ideal target for the
emerging techniques of nanoscience.

The branching ratio of the termination process in gene
transcription is balanced. In the case most thoroughly
studied, ρ-independent termination in procaryotes, con-
ventional gel experiments performed in vitro ﬁnd a frac-
tion P of elongating RNA polymerase reading through
the termination sequence with | ln(1/P − 1)| < 4 essen-
tially always, even though P is diﬀerent for diﬀerent ter-
minators and can be made to exhibit order-1 changes
by perturbing the environment. This eﬀect is astonish-
ing from the standpoint of microscopic physics because a
stochastic decision to read through or not requires a com-
petition of transition rates - quantities of inverse time -
that must be nearly equal for the branching to be bal-
anced. RNA polymerase, however, is more the size of a
glass simulation than a small molecule and thus possesses
a broad spectrum of natural time scales spanning many
decades. Without some physical reason for a particu-
lar scale to be preferred, rate competition ought to have
been severely unbalanced, meaning that one event occurs
essentially always and the other never. Balanced branch-
ing in termination has been implicated in transcription
regulation in a few cases,3 but its broader signiﬁcance,
especially its robustness, is still a mystery.

In this paper we examine the experimental facts rele-
vant to the physical nature of termination with the goal
of determining what, if any, principle selects the time
scale for stochastic rate balance. Our conclusion is both
surprising and unsettling. We ﬁnd no evidence for such a
principle, but glaring weaknesses in the case for stochas-
ticity and a large body of unexplained experimental re-
sults pointing to a termination decision that is partially
deterministic. In light of the inaccessability of systems
this large to ab-initio computation we conclude that tran-
scription termination is a fundamentally unsolved prob-

II. TERMINATION EFFICIENCY

The

simplest

termination sequences are

the ρ-
independent terminators of procaryotes, which are capa-
ble of causing polymerase to terminate in vitro in the ab-
sence of the ρ protein factor. A representative sampling
of these is reproduced in Table I. This diﬀers from lists
that have appeared in the literature before4,5 by having
been rechecked against the fully-sequenced genome6 and
expunged of “theoretical” terminators identiﬁed only by
computer search. They conform for the most part to the
motif of a palindrome of typically 10 base pairs followed
by a short poly-T stretch, although there is tremendous
variety in the length and composition of the palindrome,
variation in the length of the poly-T stretch, and occa-
sional extension of the palindrome to include the poly-
T stretch. This enormous variability contrasts with the
simplicity of stop codons, which terminate protein syn-
thesis by ribosomes and have no other function.

ρ-independent terminators are characterized by “eﬃ-
ciencies”, i.e., the fraction of assayed transcripts that ter-
minate. These rarely take on extreme values close to 1 or
0 when measured in vitro. In cases where a measurement
in vivo exists as well the latter is usually larger7 and is
occasionally unmeasurably close to 1. Balanced termina-
tion eﬃciency is commonly observed in vivo as well, how-
ever. Table II shows results from a particularly careful
study7 in vitro in which termination probabilities in E.
coli for wild-type terminators, mutant terminators, phage
terminators,8 and terminators from S. Boydii were mea-
sured under identical conditions. Despite the great vari-
ety of these sequences the termination eﬃciency runs only

TABLE IV. Termination eﬃciences for wild-type E. coli
polymerase (rpo+) and mutant polymerase (rpo203).12 trp t
is native to the genome. The rest are either mutants or syn-
thetic.

The results in Tables III and IV show balanced ter-
mination for modiﬁed versions of the phage terminator
tR211 and for mutant polymerase.12 This also makes
order-1 changes to the eﬃciencies themselves.
Simi-
lar eﬀects were reported by other researchers9,13 with
diﬀerent mutant polymerases. Modiﬁcations up to 20
base pairs upstream and downstream of the terminator
cause large changes to the eﬃciency without causing it to
unbalance.7 Thus balanced termination eﬃciency is the
norm rather than the exception.

III. LARGE MOLECULES AND GLASSES

Large systems are qualitatively diﬀerent from small
ones.14 The speciﬁc heat of all non-crystalline matter in
macroscopic quantities - including biological matter - is
proportional to T at low temperatures.15 This behavior is
fundamentally incompatible with the linear vibration of
the atoms around sites, and is caused by collective quan-
tum tunneling of atoms between energetically equivalent
“frustrated” conﬁgurations.16 It contrasts sharply with
the T 3 behavior of crystals with small unit cells. Glasses
also exhibit stretched-exponential time dependence in re-
sponse to perturbations, i.e., of the form exp(−Atβ) with
β < 1, indicating a broad spectrum of decay rates rather
than just one. They also exhibit memory eﬀects, such as
“remanence” in spin glasses17 or the well-known failure of
ordinary silica to crystallize without annealing. This be-
havior is universal and robust. All non-crystalline macro-
scopic matter exhibits hysteresis, metastability, a broad
spectrum of relaxation times, and memory.

How large a system must be before it can exhibit
such behavior is not known, as the relevant experiments
are diﬃcult to perform except on macroscopic samples,
but there are many indications that even medium-sized
proteins have glass-like properties. Crystals of myo-
globin, a protein with a molecular weight of only 17,000,
have linear speciﬁc heats at low temperatures18 and
exhibit stretched-exponential response to photodissoci-
ation pulses.19 Denatured proteins refold on a variety
of time scales ranging from nanoseconds to seconds,20
and amino acids sequences chosen at random will not
fold at all.21 Permanent misfolding of proteins with
molecular weights of only 30,000 has been implicated in
prion diseases.22 Many enzymes exhibit hysteresis in their

3

catalytic rates.23,24 The activity of cholesterol oxidase
of Brevibacterium sp., a protein with molecular weight
53,000, was recently shown by ﬂuorescence correlation
techniques to have a memory eﬀect persisting about 1
second under normal conditions at room temperature.25
Other notable examples include wheat germ hexokinase
(mol. wt. 50,00026) with a half-life of 2 minutes,27 rat
liver glucokinase (mol. wt. 52,00028) at 1 minute,23 and
yeast hexokinase (mol. wt. 50,000) at 1-2 minutes.29
Thus RNA polymerase complexes, which have a molec-
ular weight of 379,000 and are comparable in size to the
largest computer simulations of glasses ever performed,
are good candidates for systems that exhibit glassy be-
havior.

Glassiness in enzymes is not always easy to observe.
The mnemonic eﬀect in yeast hexokinase occurs when it
is preincubated with MgATP and free Mg2+ and the re-
action is started with glucose, or preincubated with glu-
cose and free Mg2+ and started with MgATP, but not if
the enzyme is preincubated with glucose and metal-free
ATP and then started with Mg2+.23 Mnemonic behav-
ior can be destroyed by “desensitizing” the enzyme with
contaminants.26 Time scales can depend on enzyme, sub-
strate, product, activator and eﬀector ligand concentra-
tions as well as pH, buﬀers, and temperature.23,29,30 Be-
fore hysteresis and memory eﬀects were recognized, early
investigators generally adjusted such reaction conditions
until the “improper” behavior was eliminated.23

IV. POLYMERASE STATES

While the size of RNA polymerase makes it plausible
to expect glassy behavior on purely theoretical grounds,
several direct lines of evidence indicate that the enzyme
exhibits a spectrum of multiconformational, mnemonic
and hysteretic behavior:

1. Polymerase has a catalytic mode distinct from
RNA synthesis, as it can cleave the RNA transcript
through hydrolysis (rather than pyrophosphorol-
ysis, the reverse reaction of RNA synthesis),31
with the cleavage reaction requiring Mg2+,31 being
template-dependent,32 changing the polymerase
footprint size,33 and stimulated either by GreA
and GreB proteins34,35 or by high pH (8.5-10.0).36
The last eﬀect was discovered serendipitously, go-
ing unobserved for decades because assay condi-
tions were being optimized to maximize elongation
rates, which occur at lower pH values (7.8-8.237).36

2. RNA polymerase mobilities in non-denaturing elec-
trophoresis gels show signiﬁcant and discontinu-
ous variance while bearing nearly identical tran-
scripts or identical length transcripts with diﬀerent
sequences.38 These mobility variances are still ob-
served if the RNA transcript is ﬁrst removed by
ribonuclease digestion.39

3. RNA polymerase ternary complexes vary greatly
in their stability and mode of binding to DNA
(ionic or non-ionic) in a template-dependent man-
ner. Some complexes are stable against very high
salt concentrations ([K+] = 1 M), while others
(speciﬁcally those proximal to an upstream palin-
drome sequence) are salt-sensitive (completely dis-
sociating in concentrations as low as 20 mM K+).
However, the salt-sensitive complexes are stabilized
by millimolar concentrations of Mg2+.40

4. The size of the RNA polymerase footprint on the
DNA template measured by ribonuclease digestion
is signiﬁcantly altered even at adjacent template
positions, suggesting that the enzyme assumes dif-
ferent conformations during elongation.41

5. Guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) inhibits the
rate of elongation on natural DNA templates but
not on synthetic dinucleotide polymer templates,
and does not inhibit elongation by competing with
NTP binding, but by enhancing pausing. It must
therefore bind to polymerase and modify its behav-
ior at an unrelated regulatory site in an allosteric
manner, rather than interfering with the substrate
binding site.42

6. The stability of a stalled elongation complex de-
pends on whether the polymerase arrives at the
stall site via synthesis or pyrophosphorolysis.43

7. Termination eﬃciencies are aﬀected by transcribed
upstream sequences and untranscribed downstream
sequences adjacent to the terminator.44

8. Stalling elongating polymerase complexes (via nu-
cleotide starvation) and then restarting them by
nucleotide addition perturbs pausing patterns 50-
60 base pairs downstream.45

9. An elongating polymerase’s Michaelis constants KS
for NTPs vary over 500-fold for diﬀerent DNA tem-
plate positions,46 and for diﬀerent templates,47 al-
though these eﬀects are not observed for synthetic
dinucleotide polymer templates.47

10. The rate of misincorporation at a single site
for which the correct NTP is absent is signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent before and after isolation of ternary
complexes.48

11. Stalled polymerase gradually “arrests” (i.e., is in-
capable of elongating when supplied with NTPs),
with the approximate half-time for arrest estimated
at 5 minutes40 and 10 minutes49 for diﬀerent DNA
templates. The polymerase can continue elongat-
ing if reactivated by pyrophosphorolysis.40

12. Even after undergoing arrest, crosslinking exper-
iments show that the internal structure of poly-
merase gradually changes over the course of the
next hour.49

13. Observations of single elongating RNA polymerase
molecules show that it has two elongation modes
with diﬀerent intrinsic transcription rates and
propensities to pause and arrest.50

The possibility of metastability - through shape mem-
ory or the conditional attachment of factors - is di-
rectly relevant to the rate-balance conundrum because
it provides a simple alternative to balanced stochastic
branching that requires no physical miracles.
for
example, the polymerase possessed a small number of
metastable conﬁgurational states and terminated deter-
ministically depending on which state it was in, then
balanced branching would be a simple, automatic con-
sequence of scrambling the state populations.

If,

V. THERMAL ACTIVATION

The idea that polymerase memory is potentially rel-
evant to expression regulation is not new.47 It is im-
plicit in the work of Goliger et al51 and Telesnitsky and
Chamberlin44 and even explicitly speculated by the latter
in print. However, because of the experimental evidence
supporting the stochastic model of termination1 and the
widespread belief - unjustiﬁed, in our view - that pro-
teins equilibrate rapidly, this suggestion generated little
enthusiasm. A key experiment supporting the stochastic
model by Wilson and von Hippel2 is both historically im-
portant and typical, so it is appropriate that we consider
it carefully.

Wilson and von Hippel promoted and stalled RNA
polymerase 8 base pairs upstream of the tR2 termina-
tor hairpin of phage λ in vitro, thermally equilibrated at
temperature T , and then launched it forward by adding
NTP. The results are reproduced in Fig. 1a. Termina-
tion occurred at sites 7, 8, and 9 base pairs downstream
of the beginning of the poly-T stretch (cf. Table II) with
probabilities P7 = N7/N , P8 = N8/N and P9 = N9/N .
The data were originally reported as a semilogarithmic
plot of 1/ ˆP − 1 against temperature, where ˆP7 = N7/N ,
ˆP8 = N8/(N − N7) and ˆP9 = N9/(N − N7 − N8). They
concluded that all three branching probabilities ˆP were
thermally activated and had distinctly diﬀerent activa-
tion energies. However, it is clear from Fig. 1a that this
conclusion is false. The three probabilities P are essen-
tially the same function and are well characterized by the
sum P = P7 + P8 + P9, also plotted in Fig. 1a. This is
shown more explicitly in Fig. 1b, where the ratios P7/P ,
P8/P , and P9/P are plotted against temperature. The
ﬂatness of these curves shows that the branching ratios
among the three sites are essentially constant and in-
dependent of temperature within the error bars of the
experiment. Note that these fractions are also all of or-
der 1. Thus the alleged spread in activation energies was
an artifact of the plotting procedure.

Let us now consider the temperature dependence. It
may be seen from Fig. 1a that P saturates to 1 at 80
◦C, the temperature at which Wilson and von Hippel

of the enzyme rather than the termination process alone.

Guided by this observation we note that the activated be-
havior identiﬁed by Wilson and von Hippel is actually the
formula for conventional monomolecular chemical equi-
librium. The probability for a particle of mass M with a
binding energy of E0 to be ionized oﬀ the polymerase is

P =

1

1 + ZeE0/kB T n λ3
th

(λth =s 2π¯h2

M kBT

) , (1)

where n is the concentration of this component and Z
is the change to the internal partition function that re-
sults from binding. If one makes the approximation that
λth is a slowly-varying function of temperature and can
thus be taken to be constant then this reduces to the for-
mula with which Wilson and von Hippel ﬁt their data.2
That it works may be seen in Fig. 1c, where we plot the
total termination probability from experiment against
Eq. (1) with E0 = 0.7eV and Z adjusted to match ex-
periment at T = 30 ◦C. Thus reinterpreting this eﬀect as
an ionization equilibrium, we may account for the high-
temperature intercept and weak temperature dependence
seen in Fig. 1b in the following way: In addition to the
ionization state the polymerase possesses an internal con-
ﬁgurational memory with a number of states of order 10.
These code for termination at sites 7, 8 or 9. In the equili-
bration step, the polymerase molecules come to thermal
equilibrium and a fraction P of them become ionized.
All of these terminate at one of the three sites when
launched. The rest read through.

A candidate for the ionizable component is an Mg2+
ion. In their studies of the eﬀects of ion concentrations
on termination eﬃciency, Reynolds et al7 discovered that
Mg2+ has the strange and unique eﬀect of increasing ter-
mination eﬃciency to 100% for all terminators studied
when reduced below 1 mM. The Mg2+ concentration in
the experiments shown in Fig. 1d was 10 mM.2 Extrap-
olating at T = 30 ◦C53 using Eq. (1) we obtain, with no
adjustable parameters, the ﬁt to the [MgCl2] dependence
found by Reynolds et al7 shown in Fig. 1d. The quality
of this ﬁt suggests that Mg2+ has a special function in
regulating transcription, and that the temperature de-
pendence in Fig. 1a is simply a thermal binding relation
for this ion. This is corroborated by the recent structural
studies of Zhang et al,54 who report that polymerase crys-
tallized out of 10 mM solution of MgCl2 has a Mg2+ ion
bound at what appears to be the catalytic site of the
enzyme.

There is evidence for more termination channels other
than the ionization of Mg2+. In Fig. 2 we reproduce re-
sults of Reynolds et al7 showing that terminator eﬃcien-
cies tend to saturate at large Mg2+ concentration to val-
ues other than zero. The saturation values are balanced,
and there is an evident tendency of them to cluster. Both
eﬀects are consistent with the polymerase executing an
instruction at the terminator to read through condition-
ally, even when the ionizable component is bound,
if
its memory is appropriately set. There is obviously not

We note that Reynolds et al7 also found order-1 eﬀects
on the termination eﬃciency from Cl− and K+, although
with the opposite sign. The function of these ions is not

VI. ANTITERMINATION

What experiments can detect internal memory? In
general, one would look for cases in which polymerase
acts diﬀerently under apparently identical conditions,
suggesting an internal control mechanism of some kind.
Such thinking motivates the following hypothetical ex-
periment: one constructs a template with promoter P
followed by two identical terminators and ﬂanking DNA
sequences in succession. If termination is stochastic, then
the branching ratio at T2 will be the same as that at T1.
If termination is deterministic and hysteretic, then the
branching ratios will be diﬀerent, depending on details.
A passive termination at T1 would result in no termi-
nation at T2, since the polymerase that reads through
has been “polarized”, i.e., selected for the memory set-
ting that codes for read-through. An active termination
at T1 would reprogram the memory there and cause a
termination probability at T2 diﬀerent from that of T1
but not necessarily zero. Variations of this design, e.g.,
adding more terminators, combining diﬀerent termina-
tors, changing their order, etc., could, in principle, an-
swer more sophisticated questions, such as whether and
how polymerase is reprogrammed in active read-through
and whether non-equilibrium eﬀects are important.

A few such experiments have already been performed
on DNA templates containing antiterminators (sequences
upstream of terminators that reduce termination eﬃcien-
cies) and are thus less general than one would like, but
they strongly support the idea of polymerase memory.
There is indirect evidence in the case of N-antitermina-
tion of phage λ, the case most studied, that the memory
is a physical attachment of the transcribed mRNA to the

In 1989 Telesnitsky and Chamberlin44 reported mem-
ory eﬀects associated with the lac antiterminator found
just downstream of the Ptac promoter in E. coli. Their
key result is reproduced in Table V. Insertion of lac 353
nucleotides upstream of the terminator makes diﬀerent
order-1 modiﬁcations to the termination eﬃciences of
T7Te phage and trp a. The antiterminator contains a
palindrome, and the antitermination eﬀect is sensitive to
modiﬁcations of the downstream 15-base-pair sequence.
3 copies of T7Te placed in tandem downstream of lac
showed that the antitermination eﬀect is partially re-
membered through multiple terminators: the eﬃciencies
were 44%, 60%, and 90%, but without the antiterminator
they were 90%, >90%, and >90%.

In another experiment in vitro reported in 1989,
Goliger et al51 found that the E. coli terminator rpoC
t and phage terminators oop t and t82 were strongly
antiterminated by a sequence they constructed ac-
cidentally.
Their key result is reproduced in Ta-
ble VI. A phage 82 promoter was
fused onto a
sequence containing either rpoC t alone or oop t

TABLE VII. Antitermination sequences putL and putR

from the Hong Kong phage HK022.56

and rpoC t in tandem using the EcoRI linker sequence
GGAATTC. This resulted in unexpected antitermination
in vitro of both terminators, but of diﬀerent sizes that
depended sensitively on the insertion point. The read-
through eﬀects in the tandem experiments were unfortu-
nately poorly documented. One can see from Table V
that the phage terminator responded more strongly in
this experiment than did rpoC t. However, the reverse
was the case in another experiment in which the antiter-
minator was a portion of the 6S RNA gene downstream
of a phage λ pR′ promoter, and in which factor NusA
was present. As a control, this latter experiment was
rerun with the phage terminator t82, which terminated
at greater than 98% in all cases, seemingly immune to
antitermination.

King et al52 reported in 1996 that the putL and
putR antitermination sequences of the Hong Kong phage
HK022,56 shown in Table VII, caused downstream
readthrough of a triple terminator consisting of tR′ from
phage λ followed by the strong E. coli ribosome operon
terminators rrn B t1 and rrn B t2. This eﬀect was sensi-
tive to the choice of promoter. When putL was inserted
between the Ptac promoter and the triple terminator 284
nucleotides downstream and studied in vivo the termina-
tion probability was 50%. Substituting the phage λ PL
promoter for Ptac under the same conditions resulted
in complete readthrough (though with wide error bars).
When this experiment was repeated in vitro the antiter-
mination eﬀect was found to be smaller and to persist
through all three terminators. The read-through proba-
bilities at tR′ were 34% and 31% for promotion by PL
and Ptac, respectively, but 57% and 27% for rrnB t1 and
76% and 40% for rrnB t2. This result is incompatible
with statistical termination, for both the antitermina-
tion eﬀect itself and the changes resulting from switching
promoters are order-1 eﬀects that do not add. They also
reported that reduced Mg2+ concentration destroys the
antitermination eﬀect.

VII. CONCLUSION

In summary we ﬁnd that the theory of stochastic ter-
mination, which requires natural selection to engineer a
physical miracle of balanced rates, is ﬂawed, but that
there is ample evidence of a sophisticated and as-yet
poorly understood regulatory system in RNA polymerase
involving hysteresis, metastability, and long-term conﬁg-
urational memory, all robust phenomena in inanimate
matter. On this basis we predict that branching ratios of

identical terminators in series will diﬀer by order-1
amounts very generally - speciﬁcally in the absence of
looping. We propose that the confusion surrounding
the existence of polymerase memory is symptomatic of
the larger problem that measurement of physical activ-
ity on the length and time scales appropriate to life has
thus far been impossible, and that overcoming this prob-
lem should be one of the high-priority goals of modern
nanoscience.

Chemically driven electron tunnelling pumps

Igor Goychuk
Institut f¨ur Physik, Universit¨at Augsburg, Universit¨atsstraße 1, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany

The simplest mechanism for molecular electron pumps is discussed which is based on nonadia-
batic electron tunnelling and nonequilibrium conformational ﬂuctuations. Such ﬂuctuations can be
induced, e.g. by random binding of negatively charged ATP molecules to the electron-transferring
molecular complex, their subsequent hydrolysis and the products dissociation. The pumping rate
can be controlled by the ATP concentration in solution. Depending on the model parameters there
may exist a critical ATP concentration for the pump to function. Alternatively, nonequilibrium
ﬂuctuations can be induced by externally applied stochastic electric ﬁelds. For realistically chosen
parameters, the mechanism is shown to be robust and highly eﬃcient.

INTRODUCTION

Electron transfer lies at heart of all bioenergetic pro-
cesses. The energy of photoexcited electronic states, or
one released in the oxidative breakdown of food molecules
is used in a chain of electron-transfer reactions to create
the transmembrane proton gradient storing ultimately
the free energy ready to use in such ”energetic” or-
ganels of biological cells as mitochondria and chloroplasts
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This electrochemical proton gradient is
used there by the ATP-syntase molecular complexes to
synthesise the molecules of adenosintriphosphate (ATP)
– a free-energy “currency” utilised in the most biochemi-
cal cellular processes which occur far away from the ther-
modynamic equilibrium under the living cell conditions.
It is well known that the ATP-syntase can work also in
reverse using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to restore the
proton gradient [3]. The existence of the reverse elec-
tron transfer, where the energy of ATP hydrolysis, or
the free energy derived from electrochemical transmem-
brane gradient of a sort of ions is used to energise the
electrons, is coming gradually in the focus of attention
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The proton pumping molecular complexes
driven normally by the energy released in the downhill
electron transfer can work in reverse, pumping the elec-
trons uphill on the time scale of seconds and minutes
[7, 10].
It might even be the case that such reverse
electron transfer evolutionary emerged earlier in archae-
bacteria existing at extremal environmental conditions
(i.e., during the most earliest steps of the biological evo-
lution). Moreover, the nitrogen ﬁxation, which is realized
by the nitrogenase protein complexes, utilises apparently
the energy released in ATP hydrolysis [11, 12, 13, 14].
These natural molecular nanomachines produce ammo-
nia routinely, at normal conditions, while the standard
industrial technological process requires large pressures
of about 150 atmospheres and temperatures in the range
of 650-720 K.

The electron transfer in nitrogenase provides one of
the key steps in the overall reaction of ammonia syn-
thesis. It is realized through a long-distance (about 14
˚A) nonadiabatic electron tunnelling between two diﬀer-

ent metalloclusters situated in two diﬀerent protein sub-
units. This process is gated by nonequilibrium confor-
mational transitions of the whole protein complex due
to ATP binding and hydrolysis, with two ATP molecules
hydrolysed per one electron transferred. How nitroge-
nase works remains still a mystery, but a proper physical
understanding gradually emerges [14]. Such understand-
ing is crucial not only for uncovering the working princi-
ples of biological nanomachinery in general, but also for
the molecular design of such and similar molecular ma-
chines for a future nanobiotechnological use. It would al-
low for an intelligent parameter optimisation, performing
ultimately better than nature. Below I consider a very
simpliﬁed, minimal theoretical model for such chemically
driven electron tunnelling pumps which is based on the
previous treatments in [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

A. Nonadiabatic electron transfer

Let us start from nonadiabatic electron tunnelling cou-
pled to molecular vibrational modes considered within
a standard two-state, donor acceptor model (cf.
one
“frozen” conformation in Fig.1). This tunnelling can be
described, e.g., within a spin-boson like model captured
by the following Hamiltonian [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]

FIG. 1: Electron pumping scenarios based on dissipative elec-
tron tunnelling and nonequilibrium conformational ﬂuctua-
tions.
In the scheme I, the energy level of the donor state
ﬂuctuates in time. This is contrasted with the scheme II,
where the acceptor level ﬂuctuates in time. For dissipative
tunnelling to occur from the donor site to the acceptor site of
electron localisation, either the donor state should gain tem-
porally in energy, or the acceptor cite should temporally lose
in energy (conformation 2). A combination of two scenar-
ios is also possible. The condition Vtun1 ≪ Vtun2 is required
for the pumping mechanism to work robustly. It is necessary
to block the reverse acceptor-to-donor electron transfer in the
conformation 1. Temporal lifting of the electron energy is pos-
sible, e.g. due to binding a negatively charged ATP molecule
nearby the corresponding site of localisation. The tunnelling
coupling can be exponentially reduced, e.g. due to increase of
the tunnelling distance, or due to disruption of the tunnelling
pathway. The latter one can be induced also by reorientation
of a bridging molecular group.

tailed balance, pD(

however, that the existence of the Boltzmann relations
for rates like one in Eq. (5) at constant ǫ and Vtun does
not guarantee, generally, the detailed balance and the
Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium distribution when these
parameters explicitly ﬂuctuate in time [25], or when a
stationary ﬂux is present (given open, or cyclic bound-
ary conditions even at constant rates). This is true even
if the rates follow adiabatically to the instant values of
the energy levels and the tunnelling coupling so that the
condition (5) is valid at any instant of time.

Independently of other details of electron-vibrational
coupling, the quantum Golden Rule rate acquires in

Such a universality explains the widespread use of Eq.
(6) in interpretation of experimental data.
It involves
(apart from temperature) three parameters only: the free
energy diﬀerence ǫ, the electron tunnelling coupling Vtun
and the reorganisation energy λ. When a coupling to
high-frequency, essentially quantum modes is present, the

expression (6) can be readily generalised accordingly [33,
34]. This presents one of the basic theories of electron
transfer in molecular systems [23, 24, 34]. Of course, it is
not truly universal, but it does provide a milestone and
the simplest theoretical framework of practical relevance.

B. Nonequilibrium conformational ﬂuctuations

electron-
transferring protein complex (or its corresponding molec-
ular subunit) can be in either of two conformations de-
pending on binding a ligand, say ATP molecule (cf.
Fig.
1). This assumption is quite in spirit of the
Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric enzymes
[35, 36, 37]. These two conformations possess very
diﬀerent Vtun (distance between the donor and accep-
tor sites is changed, or some bridging molecular group
changes its orientation interrupting, or vice versa, estab-
lishing thereby the electron-tunnelling pathway). These
conformations can correspond also to very diﬀerent en-
ergy diﬀerences between the localised electron levels, e.g.
the energy of the donor or acceptor state is changed
(ATP and the hydrolysis products, ADP and the phos-
phate group Pi, are all charged and the electrostatic ef-
fects are of utmost importance here [14]). The attach-
ment/detachment of ligand is a random process and both
ǫ(t) = ED(t)
(1) become
stochastic functions of time. Alternatively, a strong two-
state stochastic electric ﬁeld can be externally applied
to drive the electron transfer process. This is the start-
ing point of the stochastically driven spin-boson model
of Refs. [15, 16, 17, 18, 25]. It must be noted that mod-
elling of the equilibrium conformational ﬂuctuations in
such a way should be considered with a great care [25]
(see also below), but the approach suits well to model
non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations like those considered [25].
Within the approximations leading to Eqs. (2)-(4), the
quantum rates entering equations (2) become stochastic
functionals of Vtun(t) and ǫ(t). Namely, the term ǫτ in
t−τ ǫ(t′)dt′ and instead of V 2
tun in
Eq. (3) is replaced by
τ ) in the
the front of integral there appears Vtun(t)Vtun(t
R
integrand [15, 16]. However, if ǫ(t) and Vtun(t) ﬂuctuate
slow on the time scale of Q(t), one can use an adiabatic
driving approximation resulting in ﬂuctuating rates fol-
lowing to the instantaneous values of ǫ(t) and Vtun(t).
This approximation is reasonable as a simple starting
point for modelling and it can be justiﬁed in many cases.
For these reasons, it is used below. The discussed adia-
batic assumption means that after every conformational
jump the vibrational relaxation to the new equilibrium
of the vibrational degrees of freedom occurs very fast as
compare with the mean duration of time spent in the
corresponding conformation. Otherwise, the adiabatic
driving approximation cannot be justiﬁed and the the-
ory becomes essentially more intricate [15, 16, 17, 18].

Furthermore, let us assume that the conformational

α and β which do not depend on where the electron
is localised, but are controlled by thermodynamically
nonequilibrium concentrations of ATP, ADP, Pi in the
solution (i.e. ATP is continuously supplied [38]). To
be more concrete, let us assume that the conformational
transition “1
2” is caused by the ATP binding to
the electron-transferring molecular complex (scheme I).
Then, the transition rate α should obviously be propor-
tional to the ATP concentration, [ATP], in the solution,
i.e. α
[ATP], since the binding frequency is propor-
tional to [ATP]. On the contrary, the rate β of the con-
1” caused by the ATP hydrol-
formational transition “2
ysis and the products dissociation should not depend on
[ATP], but be rather determined by the activation bar-
rier between two conformations and the energy released
by breaking the phosphate bond. Such nonequilibrium
ﬂuctuations fuelled by this, or another source of chem-
ical energy can drive electron transfer (ET) uphill. Al-
ternatively, they can be induced by an externally applied
stochastic electric ﬁeld [39, 40]. It can either be directly
coupled to the electron transfer [16, 17, 18], or modu-
late the electron levels indirectly, via the electroconfor-
mational coupling [39]. Then, within the discussed ap-
proximations, the ET transfer kinetics is described by the
kinetic equations (2) with time-dependent rates undergo-
ing two-state Markovian ﬂuctuations. Formally, this is a
typical problem of dynamical disorder [41, 42, 43, 44]. It
can equivalently be described by the four-state Marko-
vian kinetic scheme depicted in Fig. 2 [45]. Similar
schemes are standard by considering the problem of free
energy transduction in biology [49, 50, 51].

These equations describe the process at thermodynam-
ical equilibrium if the overall stationary ﬂux is absent,
i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise ﬂuxes are mutually
compensated. This requires that the product of forward
rates along the cycle is equal to the product of backward
rates, see e.g. in [50, 52, 53, 54]. Otherwise, a nonequi-
librium steady state (NESS) emerges with a persistent
ﬂux present. In such a case, one either requires a free
energy supply to produce the corresponding stochastic
cyclic motion (uphill motion on an eﬀective free energy
landscape), or this energy will be released (in the down-
hill motion). Let us consider the situation where the
averaged free energy bias ǫ = ǫ1pst
2 is negative,
ǫ < 0 (pst
2 are the stationary probabilities of the
corresponding conformations). Then the cycling in the
counterclockwise direction in Fig. 2 is required to pump
the electrons against the averaged free energy bias ǫ < 0
– the case of our interest here. If NESS corresponds to
the clockwise total probability ﬂux in Fig. 2, the roles of
donor and acceptor states are interchanged and the con-
formational ﬂuctuations can be driven by the energy re-
leased in the downhill electron transfer. These conforma-
tional ﬂuctuations can in turn be coupled to an ion ﬂux
to produce the uphill ion ﬂow against the corresponding
electrochemical gradient. This is the operating principle
of the electron-driven proton pumps [3, 52]. The details
are, of course, much more involved (a more complex, ex-
tended kinetic scheme is required to describe these pro-
cesses in a consistent manner) and still not completely
understood. The operating principle is, however, rather
clear due to (nonlinear) nonequilibrium thermodynam-
ics considerations. In the present context, we combine
them with a quantum treatment of the electron transfer
kinetics.

The free energy ∆Gdrive, which is required to drive one
cycle on average in the counterclockwise direction in Fig.
2 is determined by the well-known condition [50]

In the sec-

For the scheme II, ∆Gdrive = EA1
ond line, we took Eq.
(5) into account. As discussed
above, this energy can be delivered, e.g., due to the ATP
hydrolysis (breaking the energy rich phosphate bond),
or derived from any other free energy source (the pro-
ton gradient, for example, via protonation/deprotonation
of the molecular pump). Obviously,
if only the tun-
nelling matrix element is modulated by the conforma-
tional transitions, then no pumping is possible and the

4

described scheme agrees with the thermodynamic equi-
librium, since no overall ﬂux is present. We return back
to the well-known problem of dynamical disorder in equi-
librium systems and no more. To pump, one has to
modulate the diﬀerence of electron energy levels ǫ in
time. With Vtun = const a pumping scenario conditioned
on the existence of inverted Marcus regime of electron
transfer, where the transfer rate decreases with the in-
crease of the energy bias, is possible. It was described in
Ref.
[18]. In this respect, it is worth to notice that the
very existence of the inverted ET regime presents a pro-
foundly quantum-mechanical feature of nonadiabatic ET.
Therefore, such an electron pump would be essentially
quantum-mechanical. However, such a pumping scenario
based on the sole modulation of ǫ(t) would be rather in-
eﬃcient and too demanding for the system parameters
in practice. Therefore, it is not likely to be used by na-
ture. On the contrary, a properly concerted modulation
of ǫ(t) and Vtun(t) can allow to pump highly eﬃciently.
Vtun2 in
In essence, for this one has to ensure Vtun1
Fig. 1 and a proper timing when ET kinetics is gated
and locked to conformational ﬂuctuations. Two possible
pumping scenarios are depicted in Fig. 1. In the scheme
I, the donor energy level is lifted upon binding negatively
charged ATP molecule(s). Alternatively, one can modu-
late the acceptor energy level in time, scheme II in Fig.
1. In the reality, a combination of both possibilities can
take place. For example, in the case of nitrogenase the
donor level is lifted by 300 meV and the acceptor level
increases simultaneously by 100 meV, with the total in-
crease of the driving energy bias by 200 meV [14]. This
compares well with the energy release from the hydrolysis
0.5 eV under
of one ATP molecule which is about 0.3
the living cell conditions. This basic pumping mechanism
will be detailed and quantiﬁed below.

C. Solution of the model

How to proceed further is standard and well-known
[42]. The solution of the master equations (7) with the
initial conditions pj′ (0) = 1, where j′ = D1, D2, A1, A2
yields the corresponding conditional probabilities of the
state j, Pjj′ (t). We are interested in several quanti-
ties, such as (i) the asymptotic population of the donor

transferring excess electron in the both protein confor-
mations and these conformations are met with the sta-
tionary probabilities pst
2 = α/(α+β).
The former assumption is trivially valid for the scheme
II. However, for the scheme I it might be the case that
the electron aﬃnity to D2 state is much smaller than to
D1, i.e. the protein binds the transferring electron with a
much higher probability in the ﬁrst conformation (when
no negatively charged ATP is bound nearby the donor
state). In such a situation (which is not considered here
for the sake of simplicity and analytical tractability of
the results), one should put pst

D. Conditions for pumping

Let us suppose that the ET is characterised by Eq.
(6) with the negative bias ǫ1 < 0 and the tunnelling ma-
trix element Vtun1 in conformation 1 and the positive
bias ǫ2 > 0 and the tunnelling matrix element Vtun2 in
conformation 2. In addition, one assumes that the reor-
ganisation energy λ is the same in both conformations.
Then for the ratio of the averaged donor and acceptor
populations we obtain from Eq. (14):

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The outlined mechanism should be very robust. We
illustrate it in Figs. 3, 4 for the following realistic test
parameters which partially correspond to nitrogenase [14]
and partially are chosen just to demonstrate the essential
eﬀects: λ = 1.2 eV, ǫ1 =
0.1 eV, ǫ2 = 0.1 eV; the tun-
nelling coupling energies are given in the Table I together
with the corresponding Marcus rates. Furthermore, the
value β = 1000 sec−1 is used in calculations and the rate
α is varying as a control parameter assuming its propor-
tionality to the ATP concentration [ATP].

As it is clearly seen in Figs.

3, 4 the pumping
eﬀect is indeed present for Vtun2/Vtun1 = 100 (con-
tinuous line). Moreover, the mean forward time is
locked to the rate α for α < 200 sec−1, being prac-
tically its inverse. Moreover, the calculation of the

vanishes.

Furthermore, let us to keep Vtun2 the same, but to
increase Vtun1 such that the ratio Vtun2/Vtun1 becomes
much smaller, Vtun2/Vtun1 = 20 (fat dotted lines in Figs.

the critical values of the rate αc and the associated ATP
concentration [ATPc] emerge. The overall transfer oc-
curs in the “donor

On the other hand, one must keep α < β. Otherwise, the
transferred electrons will start to lose in energy on aver-
age. Clearly, such a pump would not function perfectly.
To realize a good electronic pump, the ratio Vtun2/Vtun1
must be large.

that the eﬀective backward rate is not gated by the con-
formational ﬂuctuations for the used sets of parameters.
Nevertheless, it can strongly depend on α, being almost
linearly proportional to α at small α (see the continuous
line in Fig. 5). It might thus resemble a gating regime.

One more interesting feature is that with the decrease
of Vtun2 the eﬀective transfer rate becomes smaller than
α, with the tunnelling providing the rate-limiting step
when α increases (see dashed line in Fig. 3).

A. Pumping eﬃciency

The maximal pumping eﬃciency can be deﬁned as the
averaged energy gained by the transferred electron rel-
ative to the energy required to drive one transfer cycle,

∼

For the above parameters (corresponding to the contin-
100), the maximal
uous lines in Figs. 3, 4 and α
pumping eﬃciency is rather high approaching η = 0.5
[56]. It can be even higher approaching one, if the aﬃn-
ity of the donor state D1 to electrons is much larger than
the aﬃnity of the state D2 (scheme I), i.e. the protein
complex takes preferably electrons from the bulk in the
conformation I (the formal solution of the model has to
be modiﬁed in this case, but the qualitative features re-
main).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The considered generic model might seem somewhat
oversimpliﬁed. It is indeed aimed primarily to highlight
the basic working principles and their practical relevance.
This model should be extended and generalised further in
several directions, e.g. a correlated two-electron transfer
should probably be considered in nitrogenase as an el-
ementary step rather than single-electron transfer and
a proper treatment of the ATP binding, hydrolysis and
dissociation of the hydrolysis products would require to
introduce more conformations than two. Moreover, the
external uptake and release of electrons from and to the
donor and acceptor sites, e.g., from mobile electron carri-
ers should be incorporated in the complete model. Nev-
ertheless, the considered elementary model does allow
to manifest the main operating principles which are not
much diﬀerent from those well established and clearly
understood, both phenomenologically and in progressing
details, for ionic pumps [3, 4, 36]. Moreover, it allows
one to clarify some important conditions for the eﬃcient
pumping such as a large ratio of the tunnelling couplings
in the diﬀerent conformations and a possible existence
of the critical ATP concentrations. The profound physi-
cal diﬀerence between the ionic and electronic pumps is,
however, that the electron is essentially a quantum par-
ticle and it tunnels over a large distance between met-
alloclusters in nitrogenase (also in other electron trans-
fer complexes, like cytochrome bc1) using virtually pro-
tein bridging states. This is why the details here are
deﬁnitely very diﬀerent from ionic pumps. They do
matter and are important to arrive in a future at the
detailed (quantum)-mechanistic, molecular-dynamic un-
derstanding which still is lacking at present. Unlike to
the many-years, extensive research on ionic pumps we
undertake here really the ﬁrst steps. The research do-
main of electron transfer driven by a chemical energy

source through nonequilibrium conformational ﬂuctua-

tions is just emerging.

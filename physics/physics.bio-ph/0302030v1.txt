Network Landscape from a Brownian Particle’s Perspective

(Dated: February 11, 2003)

Given a complex biological or social network, how many clusters should it be decomposed into?
We deﬁne the distance di,j from node i to node j as the average number of steps a Brownian particle
takes to reach j from i. Node j is a global attractor of i if di,j ≤ di,k for any k of the graph; it
is a local attractor of i, if j ∈ Ei (the set of nearest-neighbors of i) and di,j ≤ di,l for any l ∈ Ei.
Based on the intuition that each node should have a high probability to be in the same community
as its global (local) attractor on the global (local) scale, we present a simple method to uncover a
network’s community structure. This method is applied to several real networks and some discussion
on its possible extensions is made.

A complex networked system, such as an organism’s
metabolic network and genetic interaction network, is
composed of a large number of interacting agents. The
complexity of such systems originates partly from the
heterogeneity in their interaction patterns, aspects of
which include the small-world [1] and the scale-free prop-
erties [2, 3] observed in many social, biological, and tech-
nological networks [4, 5, 6]. Given this high degree of
complexity, it is necessary to divide a network into dif-
ferent subgroups to facilitate the understanding of the
relationships among diﬀerent components [7, 8].

A complex network could be represented by a graph.
Each component of the network is mapped to a ver-
tex (node), and the interaction between two components
is signiﬁed by an edge between the two corresponding
nodes, whose weight is related to the interaction strength.
The challenge is to dissect this graph based on its connec-
tion pattern. We know that to partition a graph into two
equally sized subgroups such that the number of edges
in between reaches the absolute minimum is already a
NP-complete problem, a solution is not guaranteed to be
found easily; however it is still a well-deﬁned question.
On the other hand, the question “How many subgroups
should a graph be divided into and how?” is ill-posed,
as we do not have an objective function to optimize; and
we have to rely on heuristic reasoning to proceed.

If we are interested in identifying just one community
that is associated with a speciﬁed node, the maximum
ﬂow method [9] turns out to be eﬃcient. Recently, it
is applied to identifying communities of Internet web-
pages [10]. An community thus uncovered is usually very
small; and for this method to work well one needs a priori
knowledge of the network to select the source and sink
nodes properly. Another elegant method is based on the
concept of edge betweenness [11]. The degree of between-
ness of a edge is deﬁned as the total number of shortest
paths between pair of nodes which pass through it. By
removing recursively the current edge with the highest
degree of betweenness, one expects the connectivity of
the network to decrease the most eﬃciently and mini-
mal cutting operations is needed to separate the network
into subgroups [7]. This idea of Girvan and Newman [7]

could be readily extended to weighted graphs by assign-
ing each edge a length equalling its reciprocal weight.
Furthermore, in the sociology literature, there is a rel-
atively long tradition in identifying communities based
on the criteria of reachability and shortest distance (see,
e.g., [12]).

In this paper, a new method of network community
It is based on the concept
identiﬁcation is described.
of network Brownian motion: If an intelligent Brown-
ian particle lives in a given network for a long time,what
might be its perspective of the network’s landscape? We
suggest that,without the need to removing edges from
the network, the node-node distances “measured” by this
Brownian particle can be used to construct the commu-
nity structure and to identify the central node of each
community. This idea is tested on several social and
biological networks and satisﬁable results are obtained.
Several ways are discussed to extend and improve our
method.

Consider a connected network of N nodes and M
edges. Its node set is denoted by V = {1, · · · , N } and
its connection pattern is speciﬁed by the generalized ad-
jacency matrix A.
If there is no edge between node i
and node j, Aij = 0; if there is an edge in between,
Aij ≡ Aji > 0 and its value signiﬁes the interaction
strength (self-connection is allowed). The set of nearest-
neighbors of node i is denoted by Ei. A Brownian parti-
cle keeps moving on the network, and at each time step
it jumps from its present position (say i) to a nearest-
neighboring position (j). When no additional knowledge
about the network is known, it is natural to assume the
N
l=1 Ail (the
following jumping probability Pij = Aij /
corresponding matrix P is called the transfer matrix).
One veriﬁes that at time t ≫ M the probability ρ(k) for
the Brownian particle to be at any node k is nonvan-
ishing and equals to
m,n Amn, proportional to
l Akl/
l Akl of node k.
the total interaction capacity

P
P
Deﬁne the node-node distance di,j from i to j as the
average number of steps needed for the Brownian particle
to move from i through the the network to j. From some
simple linear-algebra calculation [13] it is easy to see that

where I is the N × N identity matrix, and matrix B(j)
equals to the transfer matrix P except that Blj(j) ≡ 0
for any l ∈ V . The distances from all the nodes in V to
node j can thus be obtained by solving the linear alge-
braic equation [I −B(j)]{d1,j , · · · , dN,j}T = {1, · · · , 1}T .
We are mainly interested in sparse networks with M =
O(N ); for such networks there exist very eﬃcient algo-
rithms [14, 15] to calculate the root of this equation. If
node j has the property that di,j ≤ di,k for any k ∈ V ,
then j is tagged as a global attractor of node i (i is closest
to j in the sense of average distance). Similarly, if j ∈ Ei
and di,j ≤ di,l for any l ∈ Ei, then j is an local attractor
of i (i is closest to j among all its nearest-neighbors). We
notice that, in general the distance from i to j (di,j ) dif-
fers from that from j to i (dj,i). Consequently, if j is an
attractor of i, node i is not necessarily also an attractor
of j.

If a graph is divided into diﬀerent subgroups, on the lo-
cal scale we intuitively expect that each node i will have
a high probability to be in the same subgroup as its lo-
cal attractor j, since among all the nearest-neighboring
nodes in Ei, node j has the shortest “distance” from node
i. For simplicity let us just assume this probability to be
unity (a possible improvement is discussed later). Thus,
we can deﬁne a local-attractor-based community (or sim-
ply a “L-community”) as a set of nodes L = {i1, · · · , im}
such that (1) if node i ∈ L and node j is an local attrac-
tor of i, then j ∈ L, (2) if i ∈ L and node k has i as its
local attractor,then k ∈ L, and (3) any subset of L is not
a L-community. Clearly, two L-communities La and Lb
are either identical (La ≡ Lb) or disjoint (La ∩ Lb = ∅).
Based on each node’s local attractor the graph could be
decomposed into a set of L-communities.

According to the same intuitive argument, on the
global scale we expect that each node will have a high
probability to be in the same community as its global
attractor, and if assume this probability to be unity we
can similarly construct the global-attractor-based commu-
nities (“G-communities”) based on the global-attractor
of each node. For small networks, we expect the L-
and G-community structures to be identical; while for
large networks, each G-community may contain several
L-communities as its subgroups. A community could be
characterized by its size Nc and an instability index Ic.
A node i in community C is referred to as unstable if
its total direct interaction with nodes in any another
community C′,
k∈C ′ Aik, is stronger than its total di-
rect interaction with other nodes in its own community,
k∈C\i Aik. Ic is the total number of such nodes in each
community. We can also identify the center of a commu-
P
nity (if it exists) as the node that is the global attractor
of itself.

Now we test the above-mentioned simple method on

2

some well-documented networks whose community struc-
tures are known. The ﬁrst example is the social network
recorded by Zachary [16]. This network contains 34 nodes
and 77 weighted edges, and it was observed to sponta-
neously ﬁssion into two groups of size 16 and 18, respec-
tively [16] (these two groups are marked by two colors in
Fig. 1A). The results of our method is shown in Fig. 1A.
Community L1 contains 11 elements (node 13 is unstable
and has stronger direct interaction with L2), L2 has 6 el-
ements (node 9 has stronger direct interaction with L3),
and L3 has 17 elements. Nodes 1 (the manager), 3, and
34 (the oﬃcer) are the corresponding centers. We ﬁnd
that for this network the G-communities coincide with
the L-communities.

As another example, the scientiﬁc collaboration net-
work of Santa Fe Institute [7] is considered. The gi-
ant connected component contains 118 nodes and 200
weighted edges, the weights are assigned according to
the measure in [17]. The present method divides the net-
work into six L-communities, see Fig. 1B. All the nodes in
community L1 (size 14), L2 (41), L4 (8), L5 (26), and L6
(17) are locally stable, and one node in L3 has stronger
direct interaction with community L6. Same as the above
example, the G-community structure is also identical to
the L-community structure. Girvan and Newman divided
this network into four major groups by recursively re-
moving edges of highest degree of betweenness [7]: the
largest of which was further divided into three subgroups
and the second largest was divided into two subgroups.
There are still some minor diﬀerences between the six
subgroups obtained by the present method and those ob-
tained in [7], which may be attributed to the fact that,
in the treatment of [7] the network was regarded as un-
weighted.

The method is further tested on a relatively more com-
plicated case, the foot-ball match network compiled by
Girvan and Newman [7]. It contains 115 nodes and 613
unweighted edges. These 115 teams were distributed into
12 conferences by the game organizers. Based on the con-
nection pattern, the present method divides them into 15
L-communities, of which 11 are locally stable: L2 (size 9),
L3 (13), L4 (14), L5 (10), L6 (8), L7 (6), L8 (7), L9 (6),
L10 (4), L11 (6), and L13 (size 9). One element of L1 (size
9) has stronger interaction with L10, and one element of
L12 (size 10) has stronger interaction with L3, and all the
elements of L14 (size 2) and L15 (size 2) are locally unsta-
ble. The G-communities of this network are also identical
to the L-communities. In Fig. 1C the community struc-
ture of this network is shown, where nodes belonging to
each identiﬁed community are located together, and the
diﬀerent colors encode the actual 12 conferences [7]. Fig-
ure 1C indicates that the predicted communities coincide
very well with the actual communities. The community
structure obtained by the present method is also in very
good correspondence with that obtained by Girvan and
Newman [7] based on edge betweenness.

The above-studied networks all have relatively small
network sizes and the identiﬁed G-communities coincide

with the L-communities. Now we apply our method to
the protein interaction network (yeast core [18, 19]) of
baker’s yeast. The giant connected component of this
network contains 1471 proteins and 2770 edges (assumed
to be unweighted, since the interaction strengths be-
tween the proteins are generally undetermined). The
present method dissect this giant component into 14 G-
communities (Table. I) and into 69 L-communities (11
of them contain one locally unstable node, 15 of them
have 2-7 locally unstable nodes, all the others are stable).
The relationship between the G- and L-communities is
demonstrated in Fig 1D, where proteins are grouped into
L-communities and those of the same G-community have
the same color. We see from Fig. 1D that if two nodes
are in the same L-community, they are very probable to
be in the same G-community. The largest G-community
(G1) contains more than half of the proteins and is cen-
tered around nucleoporin YMR047C, which, according to
SWISS-PROT description [20], is “an essential compo-
nent of nuclear pore complex” and “may be involved in
both binding and translocation of the proteins during
nucleocytoplasmic transport”. YMR047C interact directly
only with 39 other proteins (it is even not the most con-
nected node in the system), but associated with it is a
group of 935 proteins as suggested by the present method.
The protein interaction network may be evolved to facili-
tate eﬃcient protein transportation by protein-mediated
indirect interactions.

What will happen if the protein YMR047C is removed
from the network? The resulting perturbed system has
1463 nodes and 2729 edges, and we ﬁnd that its L-
community structure does not change much. Altogether
72 L-communities are identiﬁed, and most of them con-
tain more or less the same set of elements as in the un-
perturbed network. However, there is a dramatic change
in the G-community structure. There are now 21 G-
communities (the largest of which has 574 proteins),
while G1 of the original system breaks up into eight
smaller G-communities.
It was revealed that the most
highly connected proteins in the cell are the most im-
portant for its survival, and mutations in these proteins
are usually lethal [21]. Our work suggests that, these
highly connected proteins are especially important be-
cause they help integrating many small functional mod-
ules (L-communities) into a larger unit (G-community),
enabling the cell to perform concerted reactions in re-
sponse to environment stimuli.

In the above examples, the network studied are all from
real-world. We have also tested the performance of our
method to some artiﬁcial networks generated by com-
puter. To compare with the result of Ref. [7], we gen-
erated an ensemble of random graphs with 128 vertices.
These vertices are divided into four groups of 32 vertices
each. Each vertex has on average 16 edges, zout of which
are to vertices of other groups, and the remaining are to
vertices within its group; all these edges are drawn ran-
domly and independently in all the other means. Using
the method of Girvan and Newman, it was reported [7]

3

that when zout < 6 all the vertices could be classiﬁed
with high probability. Our present method in its sim-
plest form could work perfectly only when zout < 2.5.
In the artiﬁcial network, the vertices are identical with
each other in the statistical sense and there is no correla-
tion between the degrees of two neighboring edges. Our
method seems not to be the best for such kind of random
networks.

In summary, we have suggested a simple way of group-
ing a graph of nodes and edges into diﬀerent subgraphs
based on the node-node distance measured by a Brown-
ian particle. The basic idea was applied to several real
networked systems and very encouraging results were ob-
tained. The concept of random walking was also used in
some recent eﬀorts to facilitate searching on networks
(see, e.g., [22, 23]), the present work may be the ﬁrst at-
tempt in applying it on identifying network community
structure. Some possible extensions of our method are
immediately conceivable: First, in the present work we
have assumed that a node will be in the same commu-
nity as its attractor with probability 1. Naturally, we can
introduce a “inverse temperature” β and suppose that
node i be in the same community as node j with prob-
ability proportional to exp(−βdi,j). The present work
discusses just the zero temperature limit. We believe
that the communities identiﬁed at zero temperature will
persist until the temperature is high enough. Second,
we can construct a gross-grained network by regarding
each L-community as a single node, and deﬁning the dis-
tance from one L-community to another as the average
node-node distance between nodes in these two commu-
nities. The present method can then be applied, and the
relationship between diﬀerent L-communities can be bet-
ter understood. Third, for very large networks, it is im-
practical to consider the whole network when calculating
node-node distance. Actually this is not necessary, since
the length of the shortest path between a given node and
its attractor should be small. We can therefore focus on
a localized region of the network to identify the attractor
of a given node.

Furthermore, based on the distance measure of the
present paper, we can deﬁne a quantity called the dis-
similarity index for any two nearest-neighboring nodes.
Nearest-neighboring vertices of the same community tend
to have small dissimilarity index, while those belonging
to diﬀerent communities tend to have high dissimilarity
index. Extensions of the present work will be reported
in a forthcoming paper [24].

An interesting task is to use extended versions of the
present method to explore the landscape of the Internet’s
autonomous system [3] and that of the metabolic network
of E. coli [8, 25].

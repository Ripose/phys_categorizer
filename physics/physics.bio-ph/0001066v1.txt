Abstract

The systematics of indices of physico-chemical properties of codons and amino acids
across the genetic code are examined. Using a simple numerical labelling scheme for
nucleic acid bases, A = (−1, 0), C = (0, −1), G = (0, 1), U = (1, 0), data can be
ﬁtted as low order polynomials of the 6 coordinates in the 64-dimensional codon weight
space. The work conﬁrms and extends the recent studies by Siemion of the conformational
parameters. Fundamental patterns in the data such as codon periodicities, and related
harmonics and reﬂection symmetries, are here associated with the structure of the set
of basis monomials chosen for ﬁtting. Results are plotted using the Siemion one step
mutation ring scheme, and variants thereof. The connections between the present work,
and recent studies of the genetic code structure using dynamical symmetry algebras, are
pointed out.

1 Introduction and main results

Fundamental understanding of the origin and evolution of the genetic code[1] must be
grounded in detailed knowledge of the intimate relationship between the molecular bio-
chemistry of protein synthesis, and the retrieval from the nucleic acids of the proteins’
stored design information. However, as pointed out by Lacey and Mullins[2], although ‘the
nature of an evolutionary biochemical ediﬁce must reﬂect . . . its constituents, . . . properties
which were important to prebiotic origins may not be of relevance to contemporary sys-
tems’. Ever since the ﬁnal elucidation of the genetic code, this conviction has led to many
studies of the basic building blocks themselves, the amino acids and the nucleic acid bases.
Such studies have sought to catalogue and understand the spectrum of physico-chemical
characteristics of these molecules, and of their mutual correlations. The present work is
a contribution to this programme.

Considerations of protein structure point to the fundamental importance of amino
acid hydrophilicity and polarity in determining folding and enzymatic capability, and
early work (Woese[3], Volkenstein[4], Grantham[5]) concentrated on these aspects; Weber
and Lacey[6] extended the work to mono- and di-nucleosides. Jungck[7] concluded from
a compilation of more than a dozen properties that correlations between amino acids and
their corresponding anticodon dinucleosides were strongest on the scale of hydrophobic-
ity/hydrophilicity or of molecular volume/polarity (for a comprehensive review see[2]).

Subsequent to this early work, using statistical sequence information, conformational
indices of amino acids in protein structure have been added to the data sets[8]. Recently
Siemion[10] has considered the behaviour of these parameters across the genetic code, and
has identiﬁed certain periodicities and pseudosymmetries present when the data is plotted
in a certain rank ordering called ‘one step mutation rings’, being generated by a hierarchy
of cyclic alternation of triplet base letters(see [11]). The highest level in this hierarchy is
the alternation of the second base letter, giving three major cycles based on the families
U, C and A, each sharing parts of the G family. The importance of the second base in
relation to amino acid hydrophilicity is in fact well known[6, 2, 12], and the existence of
three independent correlates of amino acid properties, again associated with the U, C and
A families, has also been statistically established by principal component analysis[13].

Given the existence of identiﬁable patterns in the genetic code in this sense, it is of
some interest and potential importance to attempt to describe them more quantitatively.
Steps along these lines were taken by Siemion[14]. With a linear rank ordering of amino
acids according to ‘mutation angle’ πk/32, k = 1, . . . , 64 along the one step mutation rings,
parameter P α was reasonably approximated by trigonometric functions which captured
the essential ﬂuctuations in the data.

The metaphor of there being some quantity k (such as the Siemion mutation angle),
allowing the genetic code to be arranged in a way which best reﬂects its structure, in
analogy with elemental atomic number Z and the chemical periodic table, is an extremely
powerful one. The present paper takes up this idea, but in a more ﬂexible way which does
not rely on a single parameter. Instead, a natural labelling scheme is used which is directly
related to the combinatorial fact of the triplet base codon structure of the genetic code,
and the four letter base alphabet. Indeed, any bipartite labelling system which identiﬁes
each of the four bases A, C, G, U, extends naturally to a composite labelling for codons,

and hence amino acids. We choose for bases two coordinates as A = (−1, 0), C = (0, −1),
G = (0, 1), U = (1, 0), so that codons are labelled as ordered sextuplets, for example
ACG = (−1, 0, 0, −1, 0, 1).

In quantitative terms, any numerical indices of amino acid or codon properties, of
physico-chemical or biological nature, can then be modelled as some functions of the
coordinates of this codon ‘weight space’. Because of other algebraic approaches to the
structure of the genetic code, we take polynomial functions (for simplicity, of as low
order as possible). This restriction does not at all exclude the possibility of periodicities
and associated symmetry patterns in the data. In fact, as each of the six coordinates
takes discrete values 0, ±1, appropriately chosen monomials can easily reproduce such
eﬀects (with coeﬃcients to be ﬁtted which reﬂect the relative strengths of various diﬀerent
‘Fourier’ components). Quite simply, the directness of a linear rank ordering, as in the
measure k of mutation angle, which necessitates Fourierseries analysis of the data, is here
replaced by a more involved labelling system, but with numerical data modelled as simple
polynomial functions.

The main results of our analysis are as follows. In §2 the labelling scheme for nucleic
acid bases is introduced, leading to 4N -dimensional ‘weight spaces’ for length N RNA
strands:
in particular, 16-dimensional for N = 2, and 64-dimensional for the sextuplet
codon labelling (N=3). For N = 2 the dinucleoside hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and
free energy of formation are considered. Displayed as linear plots (or bar charts) on a
ranking from 1 to 16, the data have obvious symmetry properties, and corresponding basis
monomials are identiﬁed, resulting in good ﬁts. Only four coordinates are involved for
these 16 part data sets (see table 1). Moving in §3 on to codon properties as correlated to
those of amino acids, the method of Siemion using amino acid ranking by mutation angle
is brieﬂy reviewed. It is shown that the trigonometric approximation of Siemion [14] to the
Chou-Fasman[9] conformational parameters is eﬀectively a four parameter function which
allows for periodicities of 32/5, 8, 32/3 and 64 codons. Again, simple basis monomials
having the required elements of the symmetry structure of P α are identiﬁed, leading to
a reasonable (four parameter) ﬁt. Results are displayed as Siemion mutation angle plots.
P β is treated in a similar fashion. The method established in §§2 and 3 is then applied in
§4 to other amino acid properties, including hydrophilicity and Grantham polarity. It is
clearly shown that appropriate polynomial functions can be ﬁtted to most of them (amino
acid data is summarised in table 2).

In §5 some concluding remarks, and outlook for further development of these ideas are
given. It is emphasised that, while the idiosyncracies of real biology make it inappropriate
to regard this type of approach as anything but approximate, nonetheless there may be
some merit in a more rigorous follow up to establish our conclusions in a statistically
valid way. This is particularly interesting in view of the appendix, §A. This gives a brief
review of algebraic work based on methods of dynamical symmetries in the analysis of the
excitation spectra of complex systems (such as atoms, nuclei and molecules), which has
recently been proposed to explain the origin and evolution of the genetic code. Speciﬁcally,
it is shown how the labelling scheme adopted in the paper arises naturally in the context
of models, based either on the Lie superalgebra A5,0 ∼ sl(6/1), or the Lie algebra B6 ∼
so(13), or related semisimple algebras. The origins and nature of the polynomial functions
adopted in the paper, and generalisations of these, are also discussed in the algebraic

context. The relationship of the present paper to the dynamical symmetry approach is
also sketched in §5 below.

2 Codon systematics

Ultimately our approach involves a symmetry between the 4 heterocyclic bases U,C,A,G
commonly occurring in RNA. A logical starting point then, is to consider the physical
properties of small RNA molecules. Dinucleosides and dinucleotides in particular are
relevant in the informational context of the genetic code and anticode, and moreover
are the building blocks for larger nucleic acids (NA’s). What follows in this section is a
numerical study of some properties of NA’s consisting of 2 bases, while in later sections
NA’s with 3 bases (i.e. codons and anticodons) are considered in the context of the genetic
code as being correlated with properties of amino acids.

As mentioned in the introduction, we give each NA base coordinates in a two-dimensional

‘weight space’, namely A = (−1, 0), C = (0, −1), G = (0, 1), U = (1, 0) with the axes
labelled d, m respectively ∗. Dinucleosides and dinucleotides are therefore associated with
four coordinates (d1, m1, d2, m2), e. g. AC = (−1, 0, 0, −1) with subscripts referring to
the ﬁrst and second base positions.

The physical properties of nucleic acids we choose to ﬁt to are the relative hydrophilic-
ities Rf of the 16 dinucleoside monophosphates as obtained by Weber and Lacey[6], the
relative hydrophobicity Rx of dinucleotides as calculated by Jungck[7] from the mononu-
cleotide data of Garel et al. [15], and the 16 canonical (Crick-Watson) base pair stacking
parameters of Turner[16] et al. used to compute the free heat of formation ∆G0
37 of
formation of duplex RNA strands at 37◦ Centigrade.

It should be noted that the quantity Rx was computed as the product of mononu-
cleotide values under the assumption that this determines the true dinucleotide values
to within 95 %. A result of this is that Rx is automatically the same for dinucleotides
5′ − XY − 3′ and 5′ − Y X − 3′, (naturally the same holds for molecules with the reverse
orientation), thus Rx is at best an approximate symmetry.

The 16 Turner free energy parameters are a subset of a larger number of empirically
determined thermodynamic “rules of thumb” (see for example Turner[17]), developed to
predict free heats of formation of larger RNA and DNA molecules. The possibility that
these rules have an underlying group-theoretic structure is a consideration for a future
work.

The least-squares ﬁt to the most recent values of the Turner parameters[16] is shown

in ﬁgure 1 and is given by

∆G0

37(d1, m1, d2, m2) = −3.21 − 0.05(d1 − d2) − 1.025(d2

1 + d2

2) + 0.175(m1 − m2)

(1)

which could be qualitatively compared to the tentative “ﬁt” obtained in [18] of eigenvalues
to the older version of the Turner [17] free energy parameters:

− ǫ(j1, j2, q1, q2) = −0.9 − 0.5(j1(j1 + 1) + j2(j2 + 1)) − 0.5(q1 + q2)

(2)

∗The choice (±1, ±1) and (±1, ∓1) for the four bases simply represents a 45◦ rotation of the adopted
scheme, which turns out to be more convenient for our purposes. The nonzero labels at each of the four
base positions are given by the mnemonic ‘d iamond ’.

The latter eigenvalues were obtained from a consideration of “polarity spin”, a theoretical
property postulated for the bases G and C whereby these bases made contributions of
diﬀerent sign when placed in adjacent sites of an RNA chain, in an attempt to account
for nearest-neighbour stacking eﬀects. In eq.(1) d2
1 label
and di to the spin qi. In particular the equal coeﬃcients of the d2
i and di and the relative
minus sign of the di should be noted in connection with equation (2). Moreover eq.(1)
accounts for stacking eﬀects of A and U through the mi terms.

i corresponds roughly to the Ai

Encouraged by this we attempt a ﬁt using the same monomials to Rf and Rx with

varying success, as shown in ﬁgure 2 where

Rf (d1, m1, d2, m2) = 0.191 − 0.087(d2

1 − d2

Rx(d1, m1, d2, m2) = 0.3278 − 0.1814(d1 + d2) + 0.093(d2

2) + 0.09d1 + 0.107d2 − 0.053m1 − 0.077m2 (3)
2) + 0.0539(m1 + m2) (4)

1 + d2

The values for Rf and Rx are seen to be fairly anti-correlated, thus ﬁts using the same
monomials for each seems appropriate.

3 Amino acid conformational parameters

As a case study for amino acid properties (as opposed to their correlated codon properties
in §2 above) we consider the structural conformational parameters P α and P β, which have
been discussed by Siemion[10]. In [14] a quantity k , k = 1, . . . , 64 was introduced which
deﬁned the so-called ‘mutation angle’ πk/32 for a particular assignment of codons (and
hence of amino acids) in rank ordering. This is a modiﬁcation of the four ring ordering
used above for plots (expanded from 16 to 64 points), and arises from a certain hierarchy
of one step base mutations. It assigns the following k values to the NN ′Y and NN ′R
codons†

wherein (as in the ‘four ring’ scheme) the third base alternates as . . .−G, A−U, C −C, U −

ordering corresponds to a particular trajectory around the diamond shaped representation
of the genetic code (ﬁgure 3), which is pictured in ﬁgure 4 ([10]) where nodes have been
labelled by amino acids.

Inspecting the trends of assigned P α values for the amino acids ordered in this way, a
suggestive 8 codon periodicity, and a plausible additional C2 rotation axis about a spot in

the centre of the diagram, have be identiﬁed[10]. Figure 5 gives various ﬁts to this data,
as follows. Firstly, consideration of the modulation of the peaks and troughs of the period
8 component, on either side of the centre at k = 0, leads to the trigonometric function[14]

P α

S (k) = 1.0 − [0.32 + 0.12 cos(

kπ
16

)] cos(

kπ
4

) − .09 sin(

kπ
32

)

(5)

where the parameters are estimated simply from the degree of variation in their heights
(and 0.44 = 0.32 + 0.12 is the average amplitude). Least squares ﬁtting of the same data
in fact leads to a similar function,

P α

L (k) = 1.02 − [0.22 + 0.21 cos(

kπ
16

)] cos(

kπ
4

) + .005 sin(

kπ
32

).

(6)

From the point of view of Fourier series, however, the amplitude modulation of the codon
period 8 term in P α
L merely serves to add extra beats of period 32/5 and 32/3 of
equal weight 0.06; an alternative might then be to allow diﬀerent coeﬃcients. This gives
instead the ﬁtted function

)

(7)

which has no sin( kπ
32 ) term, but is almost indistinguishable from equation (6) above (note
that 0.22 + 0.21 ≃ 0.22 + 0.11 + 0.07 ≃ 0.32 + 0.12 = .44). In ﬁgure 5 the P α data is
displayed as a bar chart along with P α
F above; as can be seen, both ﬁts show
similar trends, and both have diﬃculty in reproducing the data around the ﬁrst position
codons of the C family in the centre of the diagram (see caption to ﬁgure 5).

S , and P α

Basing the systematics of the genetic code on numerical base labels, as advocated in
the present work, a similar analysis to the above trigonometric functions is straighfor-
ward, but now in terms of polynomials over the six codon (i.e. trinucleotide) coordinates
(d1, m1, d2, m2, d3, m3). There is no diﬃculty in establishing basic 8-codon periodic func-
tions; combinations such as 3
2 on A, G, C, U), or more
simply the perfect Y /R discriminator d3 − m3 (with values −1, +1 on R, Y respectively)
can be assumed. Similarly, terms such as d1 ± m1 have period 16, and d2 ± m2 have period
64. The required modulation of the 8 codon periods can also be regained by including in
the basis functions for ﬁtting a term such as d2
2, and ﬁnally an enhancement of the C ring
family boxes GCN, CCN is provided by the cubic term m1m2(m2 − 1). The resulting
least squares ﬁtted function is

2m3 (with values − 3

(8)

and is plotted against the P α data in ﬁgure 7. The resulting ﬁt‡ is rather insensitive to
the weights of d3 and m3 (allowing unconstrained coeﬃcients in fact results in identical
weights ±.02 for the linear terms and −.064, +.085 for the d2
2 coeﬃcients respectively). It

(indicated by the dots in ﬁgure 5), the least squares ﬁt is applied for the polynomial functions to all 64
data points. See [14] and the captions to ﬁgures 5 and 7

L and P α

should be noted that, despite much greater ﬁdelity in the C ring, P α
6 shows similar features
to the least squares trigonometric ﬁts P α
F in reproducing the 8 codon periodicity
less clearly than P α
S (see ﬁgure 5). This indicates either that the minimisation is fairly
shallow at the ﬁtted functions (as suggested by the fact that P α
F diﬀer by less than
±0.01 over one period), or that a diﬀerent minimisation algorithm might yield somewhat
diﬀerent solutions. To show the possible range of acceptable ﬁts, a second monomial is
displayed in ﬁgure 7 whose d2
2(d3 − m3) coeﬃcient is chosen as −0.2 rather than −0.075.
This function plays the role of the original estimate P α
S of ﬁgure 5 in displaying a much
more pronounced eight codon periodicity than allowed by the least squares algorithm.

L and P α

The nature of the eight-codon periodicity is related to the modulation of the con-
formational status of the amino acids through the R or Y nature of their third codon
base[19]. A sharper discriminator[19] of this is the diﬀerence P α − P β, which suggests
that a more appropriate basis for identifying numerical trends is with P α − P β (the helix
forming potential) and P α + P β (generic structure forming potential). Although we have
not analysed the data in this way, this is indirectly borne out by separate ﬁtting (along
the same lines as above) of P β, for which no signiﬁcant component of (d3 − m3) is found.
A typical ﬁve parameter ﬁt, independent of third base coordinate, is given by

P β

6 (d1, m1, d2, m2, d3, m3) =

1.02 + .26d2 + .09d2

1 − .19d2(d1 − m1) − .1d1m2(m2 − 1) − .16m2

1m2(m2 − 1). (9)

Figure 8 shows that this function does indeed average over the third base Y /R ﬂuctuations
evident in the A family data. A major component appears to be the dependence on
(d1 − m1), that is, on the Y /R nature of the ﬁrst codon base, responsible for the major
peaks and troughs visible on the A and U rings (and reﬂected in the d2(d1 − m1) term).
The cubic and quartic terms follow the modulation of the data on the C ring.

The suggested pseudosymmetries of the conformational parameters are important for
trigonometric functions of the mutation angle, and for polynomial ﬁts serve to identify
leading monomial terms with simple properties. The d2(d1 − m1) term in the ﬁt of P β
6
above has been noted already in this connection. In the case of P α, it should be noted that
an oﬀset of 2 codons in the position of a possible C2 rotation axis (from k = 34, between
ACY and ACR to k = 32, after GCY ) changes the axis from a pseudosymmetry axis
(minima coincide with maxima after rotation) to a true symmetry axis (as the alignment
of minima and maxima is shifted by four codons), necessitating ﬁtting by an eight period
component which is even about k = 32. At the same time the large amplitude changes in
the C ring appear to require an odd function, and are insensitive to whether the C2 axis
is chosen at k = 32 or k = 34. The terms in P α

6 above have just these properties.

4 Other amino acid properties

In this section we move from the biologically measured conformational parameters to
biochemical indices of amino acid properties. Two of the most signiﬁcant of these are the
Grantham polarity[5] and the relative hydrophilicity as obtained by Weber and Lacey [6].
Variations in chemical reactivity have been considered in [11], but are not modelled here.

The composite Grantham index incorporates weightings for molecular volume and
molecular weight, amongst other ingredients[5]. From ﬁgure 10 it is evident that a major
pattern is a broad 16-codon periodicity (indicative of a term linear in d2). Additional
smaller ﬂuctuations coincide approximately with the 8-codon periodicity of the Y /R na-
ture of the third base (d3 − m3 dependence). Although there is much complex variation
due to the ﬁrst base, in the interests of simplicity, the following ﬁtted function ignores
this latter structure, and provides an approximate (2 parameter) model (see ﬁgure 10):

G6(d1, m1, d2, m2, d3, m3) = 8.298 − 2.716d2 − 0.14(d3 − m3).

(10)

The pattern of amino acid hydrophilicity is also seen to possess an 8 codon periodicity.

The 4 parameter ﬁtted function considered, which is plotted in ﬁg. 9, is:

Rf 6(d1, m1, d2, m2, d3, m3) =

0.816 − 0.038d2 − 0.043m2 + 0.022(d3 − m3) + 0.034(1 − d2)d2(d3 − m3)

(11)

As with the case of Grantham polarity, the 8-period extrema might be more ’in phase’
with the data if codons were weighted according to usage, after the approach of Siemion
[14].

5 Conclusions and outlook

In this paper we have studied codon and amino acid correlations across the genetic code
starting from the simplest algebraic labelling scheme for nucleic acid bases (and hence
RNA or DNA strands more generally). In §2 several dinucleoside properties have been
ﬁtted as quadratic polynomials of the labels, and §3 and §4 have considered amino acid
parameters as correlated to codons (trinucleotides), namely conformational parameters,
Grantham polarity and hydrophilicity. In all cases acceptable algebraic ﬁtting is possible,
and various patterns and periodicities in the data are readily traced to the contribution
of speciﬁc monomials in the least squares ﬁt.

As pointed out in the appendix, §A, our algebraic approach is a special case of more
general dynamical symmetry schemes in which measurable attributes H are given as
combinations of Casimir invariants of certain chains of embedded Lie algebras and super-
algebras ([18],[20]-[26]). The identiﬁcation by Jungck[7] of two or three major characters,
to which all other properties are strongly correlated, would similarly in the algebraic
description mean the existence of two or three distinct, ‘master’ Hamiltonians H1, H2,
H3, . . . (possibly with diﬀering branching chains). In themselves these could be abstract
and need not have a physical interpretation, but all other properties should be highly
correlated to them,

K = α1H1 + α2H2 + α3H3.

(12)

Much has been made of the famous redundancy of the code in providing a key to a
group theoretical description[20, 22]. In the present framework (see also [18, 23]), codon
degeneracies take second place to major features such as periodicity and other systematic
trends. Thus for example the noted 8 codon periodicity of the conformational parameter
P α allows the Y codons for k = 25, UCY , and k = 63, AGY both to be consistent

with ser (as the property attains any given value twice per 8 codon period, at Y /R box
k = 24 + 1 = 25, and again 4 periods later at the alternative phase k = 56 + 7 = 63).

A related theme is the reconstruction of plausible ancestral codes based on biochemical
and genetic indications of the evolutionary youth of certain parts of the existing code.
For example the anomalous features of arginine, arg which suggests that it is an ‘intruder’
has led[28] to the proposal of a more ancient code using ornithine orn instead. This has
been supported by the trigonometric ﬁt to P α [14, 29], as the inferred parameters for orn
actually match the ﬁtted function better than arg at the k = 41, k = 61 CGR, AGR
codons. Such variations could obviously have some inﬂuence on the polynomial ﬁtting,
but at the present stage have not been implemented§.

To the extent that the present analysis has been successful in suggesting the viabil-
ity of an algebraic approach, further work with the intention of establishing (12) in a
statistically reliable fashion may be warranted. What is certainly lacking to date is any
microscopic justiﬁcation for the application of the techniques of dynamical symmetry al-
gebras (but see [18, 23]). However, it can be considered that in the path to the genetic
code, the primitive evolving and self-organising system of information storage and di-
rected molecular synthesis has been subjected to ‘optimisation’ (whether through error
minimisation, energy expenditure, parsimony with raw materials, or several such factors).
If furthermore the ‘space’ of possible codes has the correct topology (compact and con-
vex in some appropriate sense), then it is not implausible that extremal solutions, and
possibly the present code, are associated with special symmetries. It is to support the
identiﬁcation of such algebraic structures that the present analysis is directed.

A Appendix: Dynamical symmetry algebras and ge-

netic code structure

The radical proposal of Hornos and Hornos[20] to elucidate the genetic code structure
using the methods of dynamical symmetry algebras drew attention to the relationship
of certain symmetry breaking chains in the Lie algebra C3 ∼ Sp(6) to the fundamental
degeneracy patterns of the 64 codons. This theme has been taken up subsequently using
various diﬀerent Lie algebras[21, 22] and also Lie superalgebras [18, 23, 24] (see also [25]).
In addition to possible insights into the code redundancy, a representation-theoretical
description also leads to a code elaboration picture whereby evolutionary primitive, de-
generate assignments of many codons to a few amino acids and larger symmetry algebras
gave place, after symmetry breaking to subalgebras, to the incorporation of more amino
acids, each with fewer redundant codons.

In [18, 23, 26] emphasis was given not to the patterns of codon redundancy as such,
but rather to biochemical factors which have been recognised as fundamental keys to be
incorporated in any account of evolution from a primitive coding system to the present
universal one. Among these factors is the primacy of the second base letter over the
ﬁrst and third in correlating with such basic amino acid properties as hydrophilicity[3, 4].
Also, the partial purine/pyrimidine dependence of the amino acid assignments within a
family box further underlines the informational content of the third codon base[19] and
necessitates a symmetry description which distinguishes the third base letter. In [23] the
amino acid degeneracy was replaced by the weaker condition of anticodon degeneracy,
leading to a Lie superalgebra classiﬁcation scheme using chains of subalgebras of A5,0 ∼
sl(6/1) (see below for details).

A concomitant of any representation theoretical description of the genetic code is the
‘weight diagram’ mapping the 64 codons to points of the weight lattice (whose dimension
is the rank of the algebra chosen). Reciprocally, the line of reasoning adocated above
and applied in [23] to the case of Lie superalgebras suggests that any description using
dynamical symmetry algebras must be compatible with the combinatorial fact of the four-
letter alphabet, three-letter word structure of the code. The viewpoint adopted in the
present paper is to explore the implications of generic labelling schemes of this type,
independently of the particular choice of algebra or superalgebra. In particular, as pointed
out in §2 above, the weight diagram is supposed to arise from labelling each of the three
base letters of the codon alphabet with a pair of dichotomic variables. Thus the only
technical structural requirement for Lie algebras and superalgebras compatible with the
present work is the existence of a 6 dimensional maximal abelian (Cartan) subalgebra,
and of 64-dimensional irreducible representations whose weight diagram has the geometry
of a six dimensional hypercube in the weight lattice. (The relationship between the base
alphabet and the Z2×Z2 Klein four-group has been discussed in [27]). As examples of a Lie
algebra and a Lie superalgebra with this structure, we here take the case of B6 ∼ SO(13)
and A5,0 ∼ sl(6/1) respectively (other examples would be SO(4)3, sl(2/1)3).

The orthogonal algebra SO(14) has been suggested[21] as a unifying scheme for vari-
ants of the Sp(6) models[20, 22]. However, from the present perspective, it is suﬃcient
to take spinor representations of the rank 6 odd orthogonal algebra SO(13) which have

dimension 64. Consider the subalgebra chain

SO13 ⊃ SO(2)
⊃ SO(2)
5 ⊃ SO(3)
4 ⊃ Sp(3)

4 × SO9
4 × SO(1)
4 × SO(3)
5 ;
3 × SO(3)
2 ,
2 × Sp(3)′
,

or

2, 0) + (0, 1

3 × SO(3)

2) of SO(2)

where superscripts indicate base letter. The 64-dimensional representation splits into 4
16-plets at the ﬁrst breaking stage (the four families labelled by second codon base letter,
the latter being distinguished as a spinor ( 1
4 ). The same pattern
repeats for the ﬁrst codon base SO(1)
4 providing a complete labelling of the 16 family
boxes (ﬁxed ﬁrst and second base letter). The last stage gives two possible alternatives
for the third base symmetry breaking: in the ﬁrst, each family box would split into two
doublets ( 1
2 , corresponding to a perfect 32 amino acid code
4 → 2 + 2, or to Y /R degeneracy in anticodon usage; in the second case, breaking of
Sp(3)′
2) coinciding to a
48 amino acid code, 4 → 2 + 1 + 1, or to perfect Y degeneracy and R splitting in amino
acid usage. In the eukaryotic code, the 4 → 2 + 1 + 1 family box pattern of anticodon
usage is seen, whereas in the vertebrate mitochondrial code, only partial 4 → 2 + 2 family
box splitting of anticodon usage is found (see below). Finally, the above labels are all (up
to normalisation) of the form (0, ±1) or (±1, 0) for each base letter (or (±1, ±1) for the
third base for one branching) showing that this group theoretical scheme does indeed give
a hypercubic geometry for the codon weight diagram.

1 yields a family box assignment 2 × ( 1

2, 0) + (0, + 1

to U (3)

The sl(6/1) superalgebra was advocated in a survey of possible Lie superalgebras
relevant to the genetic code [18, 23], and possesses irreducible, typical representations of
dimension 64 which share many of the properties of spinor representations of orthogonal
Lie algebras (in the family sln/1 of Lie superalgebras this class of representations has
dimension 2n) and so can be compared with spinors of the even and odd dimensional Lie
algebras of rank n, namely SO2n and SO2n+1 respectively). The superalgebra branching
chain related to the SO(13) chain described above is

sl6/1 ⊃ sl(2)
⊃ sl(2)

2 × sl4/1
2 × sl(1)

2 × sl(3)
2/1;

sl(3)
sl(3)

2/1 ⊃ sl1/1
2/1 ⊃ sl2 × U1

or

where the last two steps correspond as above either to family box breaking to Y /R doublets
(as in many of the anticodon assignments of the vertebrate mitochondrial code) or to a
4 → 2 + 1 + 1 pattern (as in the anticodons of the eukaryotic code). The nature of the
weight diagram follows from knowledge of the branching in each of the above embeddings.
In fact both in the decomposition of the irreducible 64 to families of 16, and in that of
the 16 to family boxes of 4, there are a doublet and two singlets of the accompanying sl2
2
and sl2
1 algebras, so that the diagonal Cartan element (magnetic quantum number) has

the spectrum 0, ± 1
2. A second diagonal label arises because there is also an additional
commuting U1 generator at each stage with value ±1 on the two singlets and 0 on the
doublet. Alternatively, the additional label may be taken as the ±1 or 0 shift in the
noninteger Dynkin label of the commuting sln/1 algebra (n = 4 and n = 2 respectively).
Similar considerations apply to the last branching stage[23], so that again the weight
diagram has the hypercubic geometry assumed in the text of the paper.

In the dynamical symmetry algebra approach to problems of complex spectra, im-
portant physical quantities such as the energy levels of the system, and the transition
probabilities for decays, are modelled as matrix elements of certain operators belonging
to the Lie algebra or superalgebra. In particular, the Hamiltonian operator which deter-
mines the energy is assumed to be a linear combination of a set of invariants of a chain
of subalgebras G ⊃ G1 ⊃ G2 ⊃ · · · T :

H = c1Γ1 + c2Γ2 + · · · + cT ΓT

for coeﬃcients ci to be determined. For states in a certain representation of the algebra G,
the energy can often be evaluated once the hierarchy of representations of ⊃ G1 ⊃ G2 ⊃
· · · T to which they belong is identiﬁed, as the invariants are functions of the corresponding
representation labels.

As has been emphasised above, the discussion of ﬁtting of codon and amino acid prop-
erties in the main body of the paper is independent of speciﬁc choices of Lie algebras or
superalgebras. In fact, the polynomial functions of the 6 codon coordinates may simply
be regarded as generalised invariants of the smallest subalgebra common to all cases,
namely the 6-dimensional Cartan (maximal abelian) subalgebra T (so that there are sev-
eral nonzero coeﬃcients cT , with all other ci zero). This approach is thus complementary
to detailed applications of a chosen symmetry algebra, where the coeﬃcients ci (includ-
ing cT ) might accompany a speciﬁc set of Γi (functions of the whole hierarchy of labels,
whose form is ﬁxed, depending on the subalgebra). However, because the weight labels
used in the present work already provide an unambiguous identiﬁcation of the 64 states,
such functions of any possible additional labels are in principle determined as cases of the
general expansions we have been studying. For this reason it is expected that the present
work, although deliberately of a generic nature, does indeed conﬁrm the viability of the
dynamical symmetry approach.

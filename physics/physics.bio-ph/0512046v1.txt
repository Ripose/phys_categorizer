We calculate the hydrodynamic ﬂow ﬁeld generated far from a cilium which is attached to a
surface and beats periodically. In the case of two beating cilia, hydrodynamic interactions can lead
to synchronization of the cilia which are nonlinear oscillators. We present a state diagram where
synchronized states occur as a function of distance of cilia and the relative orientation of their beat.
Synchronized states occur with diﬀerent relative phases. In addition, asynchronous solutions exist.
Our work could be relevant for the synchronized motion of cilia generating hydrodynamic ﬂows on
the surface of cells.

Many eucaryotic cells possess cilia, which are motile,
whip-like structures on the cell surface [1, 2]. While cer-
tain cells such as sperm swim using a single cilium (in
this case called ﬂagellum) other cells use several or a large
number of cilia for propulsion in a ﬂuid. Epithelial cells
such as those in the respiratory tract use densely cili-
ated surfaces to transport ﬂuids. Hydrodynamic ﬂows
generated by cilia also play a key role during the mor-
phogenesis of higher organisms. In mammals, the left-
right symmetry of the embryo is broken with the help of
nodal cilia which generate a hydrodynamic ﬂow to one
side which transports signaling molecules and breaks the
symmetry [3, 4, 5]. All these cilia are based on the same
structure, called the axoneme, which is built of a very
regular arrangement of protein ﬁlaments called micro-
tubules in a cylindrical geometry. Motility is achieved
by the action of a large number of dynein motor proteins
which generate forces in the cilium while consuming a
chemical fuel. As a consequence, the cilium produces
periodic deformations in three dimensional space.

Cilia in diﬀerent organisms diﬀer mainly by their
length and their pattern of beating. They typically mea-
sure few micrometers up to a few tens of micrometers in
length and around 150 − 300 nm in diameter. While the
beat of sperm tails is typically a planar, sometimes heli-
cal wave, more complex, three dimensional, asymmetric
beating patterns occur typically in cells which propel ﬂu-
ids along surfaces. In this case, the working cycle of a
cilium consists of a fast, upright, eﬀective stroke and a
recovery stroke which brings the cilium more slowly back
to the original position on a path closer to the surface,
see Fig. 1a. Nodal cilia break the left-right symmetry of
developing embryos by generating rotatory motion in a
plane tilted with respect to the surface to which they are
attached [5].

In this letter, we discuss the hydrodynamic ﬂow ﬁeld
generated by a single cilium which beats while attached
to a surface in an asymmetric pattern. While the near

ﬁeld of the hydrodynamic ﬂow depends on the detailed
beating pattern and the whip-like geometry of the cilium,
the far ﬁeld has general features which only depend on a
few parameters characterizing the symmetry of the beat.
Using the ﬂow ﬁeld generated by a beating cilium, we
study the hydrodynamic interaction between two cilia.
We discuss conditions that lead to synchronization of the
two cilia by hydrodynamic interactions.

Our minimal model of the ciliary beat (Fig. 1b) cap-
tures the essential features and symmetries - the diﬀer-
ence between eﬀective stroke and recovery stroke of whip-
like beating as well as the tilted rotatory motion of nodal
cilia. We replace the cilium by a small sphere of radius a
(essentially describing the center of mass position of the
cilium), which moves on a ﬁxed trajectory in the vicinity
of a planar surface (deﬁned as the plane z = 0). The tra-
jectory of the bead is elliptic, the phase of the oscillation
(the position along the trajectory) is described by an an-
gle φ. The asymmetry of the ciliary beat is reﬂected in
the fact that the two principal axes (denoted A and B)
are diﬀerent, and that the ellipse is tilted with respect
to the surface as described by the parameter C. The
position of the sphere is given by

tions of the ciliary beat see, e.g., refs. [2, 6].

The viscous, over damped ﬂuid around the cilium can
be described by the Stokes equation for the hydrody-
namic ﬂow ﬁeld v

η∇2v = −∇P

(2)

where the pressure P is a Lagrange multiplier to impose
the constraint of incompressibility, ∇ · v = 0. The far-
ﬁeld generated by a moving sphere in the vicinity of a

where tan β = (yi − y)/(xi − x) and r2 = (xi − x)2 + (yi −

We assume that the active mechanism in the cilium
generates a tangential force fi = fiˆti.
In a simpliﬁed
model, it is a linear function of the velocity vi = viˆti de-
scribed by fi = f0 − κvi. Here, ˆti is a normalized vector
parallel to dxi/dφi. Note that the total force Fi acting
on the sphere is in general not parallel to the direction
of motion since normal forces arise to establish the con-
straint which keeps the sphere moving on the ellipsoidal
track. The force Fi thus obeys

ˆti · Fi = f0 − κvi .

This force is balanced by hydrodynamic friction Fi =

The resulting motion of the sphere is periodic in time. In
the limit of small radius a, the friction coeﬃcient becomes
independent of the height over the surface and the period
is T = 2π
, where ℓ denotes the trajectory
length. The phase φ0 of the sphere as a function of time
can be written as

ω ≃ (κ+γ0)ℓ

f0

φ0(ωt) = ωt + K sin(ωt) + L sin(2ωt) + . . .

(10)

The coeﬃcient L is related to the eccentricity of the el-
lipse (if the particle moves at a constant speed, the pa-
rameter φ has a variable time derivative) and thus de-
pends on the geometry of the trajectory. The coeﬃcient
K ∝ aC/D2, describes variations of the velocity due to
variations of the friction (8) resulting form varying dis-
tance of the particle from the surface.

We can now obtain the hydrodynamic far-ﬁeld of a

eraging over one period, we deﬁne the net ﬂow ¯v(x) =

i(xi)dxi. It only depends

T
on the period and the shape of the trajectory, but not
on details in the phase φ0(t). Because the sphere causes
a stronger ﬂuid motion when it is further away from the
surface (during the working stroke) than when it is closer
(recovery stroke), it causes a net ﬂuid ﬂow in y direction.
Examples of ﬂux lines of the time-averaged ﬂuid ﬂow gen-
erated in this way are displayed in Fig. 2. Far from a

Note that it only depends on the sphere radius a, the
period T and the projected area of the trajectory to the
y-z plane, πBC. Corrections to this ﬂow ﬁeld can be ne-
glected in the far ﬁeld since they decay at least as O(|x|3)
[9].

We now turn to the case of two beating cilia which in-
teract hydrodynamically. The force F2 the second sphere
exerts on the ﬂuid at position x2 generates hydrodynamic
ﬂows at position x1 and thus inﬂuences the force F1 ex-
erted by the ﬁrst sphere:

together with the corresponding equation for F2 then
uniquely determines the tangential velocities of both
spheres vi = ˆti · vi. This allows us to set up the equa-
tions of motion that determine the time derivatives ˙φ1
and ˙φ2 as functions of φ1 and φ2. The problem of two
coupled phase oscillators is equivalent to the Kuramoto
model [10], a classical model for describing synchroniza-
tion phenomena [11]. Performing numerical solutions to
these dynamic equations, we ﬁnd that for certain param-
eter values, after long times the motion of both spheres
becomes periodic with the same frequency and the oscil-
lations thus synchronize. A synchronized state is charac-

opposite phases in the limit of inﬁnite separation r. The
values of δ are displayed in Fig. 4 as a function of the
angle β for diﬀerent distances r = |x0

two cilia. For some intervals of β, no synchronized so-
lution occurs and the spheres rotate in an asynchronous
manner with two diﬀerent frequencies. Note that even
if both cilia have identical properties, the arrangement
shown in Fig 3a breaks the symmetry and both cilia can
have diﬀerent preferred frequencies when they interact.

be studied analytically. First, using Eq. (12), we ﬁnd for

Here, we have used the fact that for large r ≫ a, the
interactions decay as G ∝ r−3, while the friction terms
scale with the sphere size, γ ∝ a. Using this relation
between the tangential velocities, we can study synchro-
nization. For an isolated sphere, the phase as a function
of time is denoted φ0(t) (10). We denote by φ1(t) the
phase of a sphere 1 when interacting with sphere 2. The

A synchronized steady state exists if the change in pe-
riod due to interactions is the same for both spheres,
i.e., ∆T (r, β, δ) = ∆T (r, β + π, −δ), where we have taken
into account that exchanging both spheres corresponds
to β → β + π and δ → −δ, see Fig. 3a. Further-
more, a synchronized steady state is locally stable if
∂/∂δ[∆T (r, β, δ) − ∆T (r, β + π, −δ)] < 0.
In order to
ﬁnd explicit expressions for ∆T , we perform a system-
atic expansion in the small parameter K. In the limit of
vanishing radius a, the friction matrix γ↔ becomes inde-
pendent of the height z. The velocity of a single sphere
then becomes constant along the trajectory (K = 0). As
a consequence, the corresponding variation ∆T0 of the
period, resulting from Eq. (14), becomes symmetric with
respect to δ → −δ as well as with respect to β → β + π
and the condition that both particles have the same pe-
riod is satisﬁed trivially, regardless of the phase lag δ. In
order to ﬁnd nontrivial synchronized states, we have to
go to ﬁrst order in K where

(∆Ts(δ) ≡ ∆Ts(−δ) represents symmetric terms that are
irrelevant for synchronization). At this order in a and r,
the condition for a stable synchronized steady state is
fulﬁlled with δ = 0 for 0 < β < π/2 and π < β < 3π/2
and with δ = π for π/2 < β < π and 3π/2 < β < 2π.
This is consistent with our numerical solutions in the
limit of large r, see Fig. 4. For smaller distance r, the
contribution of terms proportional r−4 becomes relevant.
To conclude, we have shown that the hydrodynamic
far ﬁeld around a periodically beating cilium has generic
properties which do not depend on the detailed beat-
ing pattern. Its main features can thus be generated by
a sphere moving on a tilted elliptical trajectory. This
captures the asymmetry of the ciliary beat. As a con-
sequence, the resulting ﬂow is a time periodic pattern
superimposed on a time-independent net ﬂow.
If the
beating cilium is perturbed by external forces, this in-
terferes with the internal force generating process and
aﬀects the instantaneous angular velocity of oscillations.
We capture this eﬀect by a linear relationship between
external force and the velocity v of the sphere. The force
exerted on one cilium by the hydrodynamic ﬂow gener-
ated by the other couples both oscillators. The result-
ing synchronization phenomena depend on the distance
r between cilia but also the parameters a/D and a/C
which characterize the diﬀerence of eﬀective and recov-
ery strokes. No synchronization occurs if the motion is
rotationally symmetric or helical [12, 13].

A natural extension of our study is the generalization
to a periodic lattice of cilia attached to a surface. Such
situations correspond to some epithelial cells which gen-
erate ﬂuid ﬂows on their surface and to microorganisms
such as paramecium. In all these cases, the ciliary beat is
organized in metachronal waves which result from hydro-
dynamic and steric interactions between cilia. In diﬀerent
cells, these waves of ciliary strokes propagate along the
surface in diﬀerent directions relative to the one deﬁned
by the working stroke [14, 15]. Other examples for hydro-
dynamically stirred surfaces are realized in experiments
where bacteria are attached to a surface by their ﬂag-
ella which are driven by rotatory motors [16]. Each bac-
terium in this system could be represented by a rotating
sphere as in our description. In principle, the synchro-
nization eﬀects between two rotating elements discussed
here could be studied in such experiments. The extension
of our study to many hydrodynamically coupled cilia and
the description of metachronal waves and other collective
modes is left for future work.

To understand the precise kinetic details that are involved in the phenomenon of spatiotemporal
stochastic resonance (STSR), we introduce and study the eﬀect of induced STSR (ISTSR) in a
chain of nonlinear oscillators where STSR is controlled by a locally applied signal. In addition, we
pioneer the study of the eﬀective statistical renormalization of spatially-homogeneous steady states
of a generic lattice system, achieve a good agreement with numerical simulation, and observe a
bifurcation-like behaviour that reﬂects the diﬀerence between the most probable value of the local
equilibrium density and its mean value.

Over the last two decades – since the appearance of
[1, 2], – the phenomenon of stochastic resonance (SR)
has become a popular ﬁeld of research and a great deal
of experimental as well as theoretical and mathematical
work has been devoted to the study of the phenomenon
in diﬀerent systems (for reviews, see [3, 4, 5, 6]) with a
particular emphasis of its relevance and importance in
biology and medicine [7] where noise in general and SR
in particular play a surprisingly constructive role [8]. In
addition to the general description of SR [3, 4, 5, 6],
one can say that SR has the ability to generate order
from disorder and it is especially of relevance in context
of pattern formation mechanisms that are enhanced by
noise [9]. The discovery of an enhancement of the SR
eﬀect by the coupling of nonlinear oscillators into array
[10, 11, 12] has brought a new insight to studies of SR.
This eﬀect is known as array enhanced SR (AESR) or
in a wider sense as spatiotemporal SR (STSR) [5]. An
explanation of this eﬀect has previously been described
as “collective spatiotemporal motion” and “optimal spa-
tiotemporal synchronization”. In spite of much progress,
the precise kinetic details of such a synchronization re-
main without an appropriate study.

In this Letter we relate the kinetic details to a wave
front propagation and with the purpose of testing this
plausible conjecture, investigate the related problem of
the possibility of inducing STSR and controlling global
spatiotemporal order in a chain of diﬀusively-coupled
bistable oscillators (under the inﬂuence of a global ex-
ternal random noise) by a locally applied signal. Deﬁning
the notion of STSR, we say that an array of nonlinear sys-
tems is inﬂuenced by an external noise exhibiting induced
STSR (ISTSR) if its response to a deterministic signal
has an optimal property at non-zero values of three con-
trol parameters: - the noise, the coupling, and the spatial
spread of the signal (at a ﬁxed array size). We show that
we can control ISTSR by applying a signal to a small part
of the chain. This eﬀect gives a new design freedom to

mathematical modelling and its applications to biological
and biomedical problems. Further to the understanding
of ISTSR we investigate the eﬀective statistical renormal-
ization of the spatially-homogeneous steady states of a
generic lattice system and obtain a good agreement with
numerical simulation. This renormalization reﬂects the
diﬀerence between the most probable value of the local
equilibrium density and its mean value (clearly observ-
able in simulations but never previously discussed) and
leads to a new observation that the system exhibits (on a
time scale of STSR) a bifurcation-like behaviour which is
related to two control parameters of the system. Practi-
cally, it gives a criterion for the order of smallness of the
noise intensity depending on the coupling in the chain.
Both our results appear to have a ﬂavour of universality
and may stimulate a deeper search for generic phenom-
ena, e.g. in a chain of FitzHugh-Nagumo equations [13].
We consider a one-dimensional chain of overdamped
bistable oscillators with diﬀusive coupling of constant
K > 0 (the simplest one that couples local nonlinear dy-
namics in a nearest-neighbour fashion) and a bistable on-
4. We also assume
site potential V (y) =
that the system is inﬂuenced both by external random

are: the relaxation time of the chain to Gaussian ﬂuctu-

2yi + yi−1 is discrete Laplacian. Two diﬀerent topologies
are possible for the chain: either the ends are connected
or the ends are not connected. Here we take the latter
case together with Neumann boundary conditions.

The corresponding physical context of SCDE (1) is in
the kinetics of a harmonically coupled chain of particles
with transverse displacements
, considered in the
Smoluchowski limit. The underlying free energy func-
tional and the corresponding deterministic part of the

This interpretation is actually a useful reference for our
physical intuition and can considerably facilitate the un-
derstanding of the corresponding dynamic behaviour of
(1). This is especially so in view of the fact that even
diﬀusively-coupled, chain oscillators appear surprisingly
diﬃcult to analyze consistently from a rigorous mathe-
matical perspective [14].

We study a spatially discrete model rather then its con-
tinuous analog because dynamical systems with an un-
derlying chain or array structure are often of relevance in
biology and theoretical models take advantage of this fact
[15]. Then, because there exist interesting dynamical ef-
fects in discrete models that are not present in their con-
tinuous analogs, e.g., the propagation failure of travelling
waves [14], or discrete breathers [15]. Even in population
dynamics where continuous models are traditional, it was
recently demonstrated that important eﬀects due to the
discrete nature of organisms may be entirely missed by
continuous models [16].

To introduce ISTSR phenomena, we ﬁrst present a
representative result of a numerical simulation of SCDE
(1) that is performed long enough to allow the system
to persist longer than all other characteristic timescales
(we use a 4th-order Runge-Kutta method and a random
force generation according to [19] with a time step 0.01).
As shown in Fig.1 the system can indeed represent the
well-recognized phenomenon with a local signal applied
to only 1/6 part of the chain. Alternatively, the collective

variables, Y = N−1
n=k+1 yn,
adequately and legibly reﬂect features of the eﬀect as

The generic features of STSR (those related to a dif-
fusively coupled chain of bistable oscillators) have rea-
sonable prototypes going back as far as the pioneering
paper [10] where the phenomenon has been connected to
Freidlin-Wentzell theory [17]. The main point from [10] is
the idea that, in respect of the transition times (random
variable), only the energy of the unstable instanton-like
spatially inhomogeneous steady state solutions, and not
the total energy barrier for the chain, has any bearing cf.
[17]. However, in fact, there has been no discussion at all
of the transition kinetics, which appear after the birth of
the “instantons”. We suppose that an understanding of
the kinetic details gives a new insight into the study of
STSR phenomena as well as its applications.

The transition kinetics is most likely related to, but
diﬀerent from, another interesting phenomenon, namely
travelling wave solutions [14]. It is evident from the phys-
ical interpretation of (1), that a steady state travelling
wave solution will appear only in the case if the symme-
try of the potential is broken and there is a diﬀerence in
the energy between the two stable steady states that is
equilibrated by dissipative forces (in good analogy with

the steady motion of a Stokes’s ball in a viscous medium
under the action of a homogeneous ﬁeld of force). But
it is not the case for the deterministic part of (1) with
A = 0. However, if A
= 0 then the external signal pe-
riodically breaks the symmetry and creates the absolute
minimum at one of the wells of the underlying potential,
and a travelling wave front can develop on a suﬃciently
long timescale Ts. The situation changes favourably in
the case of a chain because the translational symmetry is
broken. With the chain, starting from the physical inter-
pretation as above, we can guess unstable instanton-like
steady state solutions [10]. Their characteristic lifetime
introduces a new time scale Tlt, together with a required
condition Tlt < Tω that is evidently necessary for the ex-
istence of the ISTSR eﬀect. Even if we do not estimate
Tlt explicitly, our numerical simulations justify a poste-
riori that this condition is perfectly realizable. Once the
underlying kinetic mechanism of STSR is understood via
the revelation of the ISTSR eﬀect, this opens the way to
an understanding of other interesting details.

Let us now consider the features of STSR that have
been absent in relevant previous studies (e.g.
statisti-
cal renormalization of the spatially homogeneous steady
states), with the speciﬁc SLDE

SLDE (2) is especially of relevance since it is likely to
be expected that the ﬂuctuations are Gaussian near the
stable steady states. We are mainly interested in this
particular case also since it may be easily compared with

To actually obtain ai and bi (an intractable prob-

tion of (2)), we consider a self-consistent approximation
scheme combining the minimization of J together with
the solution of (3). Thus we replace averaging accord-
ing to (2) by its Gaussian approximation according to
(3) (¯y =

Lastly we consider the diﬃcult problem of an explicit
calculation of K2(yi). Using to our advantage our tenta-
tive numerical simulations, we solve this problem under
certain hypotheses. Namely, consider the spatial corre-
lations, κmn (t) =
and suppose that the
ﬂuctuations tend to their steady state via a stage of spa-
tial homogenization, such that κmn (t) = κm−n (t) =
κr (t), and then solutions of the dynamical equations also
tend to a spatially homogeneous form. Using (5) together
with Novikov’s formula, we obtain dynamical equation

for κr (t):
and as a result, the equation for the steady state corre-

t+ > 1, this means
that t− = t−1 < 1. Therefore ﬁnally we obtain

We can solve sets (a) and (b) numerically and then com-
pare the new minima of the eﬀective potential with the
observed ones in simulations. Firstly we examine (a) and
(b) carefully. While (a) always gives the SHSS ¯y = 0 and
m/3, the set (b) has no (zero) SHSS for certain val-
κ0 ≥
ues of D and K. This can be seen in Fig.3. Fixing K and
varying D, we see that for D > D′(K) (b) has no solution
(¯y is real and κ0 > 0). In other words, the stable SHSS
(which exist for D < D′) disappear and only the solution
¯y = 0 remains. We could claim that this occurs with a
bifurcation-like behaviour. To identify this observation,
we carry out numerical experiments with the system (1)
keeping parameters as in Fig.1 and varying the noise in-
tensity D in a wide range. The response to the external
signal provides evidence of the eﬀect as shown in Fig.4.

In summary, the ISTSR eﬀect with a locally applied
signal can be considered not only as a signal ampliﬁca-
tion but also as an operator for the further transmis-
sion of an ampliﬁed signal in space. The revelation of a
bifurcation-like behaviour in a chain system gives among
other things a new criterion for STSR phenomena. Both
results appear to have a certain amount of universality
about them and may stimulate a deeper search for generic

Modeling oscillatory Microtubule–Polymerization

(July 25, 2013)

Polymerization of microtubules is ubiquitous in biological cells and under certain conditions it
becomes oscillatory in time. Here simple reaction models are analyzed that capture such oscilla-
tions as well as the length distribution of microtubules. We assume reaction conditions that are
stationary over many oscillation periods, and it is a Hopf bifurcation that leads to a persistent
oscillatory microtubule polymerization in these models. Analytical expressions are derived for the
threshold of the bifurcation and the oscillation frequency in terms of reaction rates as well as typical
trends of their parameter dependence are presented. Both, a catastrophe rate that depends on the
density of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) liganded tubulin dimers and a delay reaction, such as the
depolymerization of shrinking microtubules or the decay of oligomers, support oscillations. For a
tubulin dimer concentration below the threshold oscillatory microtubule polymerization occurs tran-
siently on the route to a stationary state, as shown by numerical solutions of the model equations.
Close to threshold a so–called amplitude equation is derived and it is shown that the bifurcation to
microtubule oscillations is supercritical.

I. INTRODUCTION

Microtubules are cylindric ﬁlaments that are used in
cells for many diﬀerent purposes, being vitally involved
in cell motility and division, in organelle transport, and
in cell morphogenesis and organization [1]. The precise
ways in which microtubules achieve their amazing vari-
ety of cellular functions is not fully understood yet. Mi-
crotubules in cells are generally dynamic, they assem-
ble, disassemble or rearrange on a time scale of minutes.
GTP (guanosine triphosphate) hydrolysis is apparently
the driving force of microtubule physiology.

The rich non–equilibrium dynamics of microtubules,
including the nucleation and polymerization kinetics etc.
[2,3] is attracting considerable attention, both experi-
mentally and theoretically [4–18]. Two phenomena in
this area, the dynamical instability of microtubules [4]
and the oscillatory polymerization [5–12] challenge theo-
retical modeling already for a while [13–18].

Oscillations during microtubule polymerization have
been observed either when GTP is regenerated enzymat-
ically from endogenous GDP (guanosine diphosphate)
[5,7,9,11] or when some amount of GTP is provided at
the beginning or during an experiment. In the latter case
oscillations occur only as a transient, because GTP is ei-
ther consumed or some reactions steps may be inhibited
due to the accumulation of GDP [8]. If both possibilities
are combined, the length of a transient regime depends
on the initial concentrations of GTP and GDP and on
the capacity to regenerate GTP. Present models for mi-
crotubule polymerization focus mainly on a description
of transiently occurring oscillations and the solutions of
the respective models are mostly numerical [6,15,17].

In recent in vitro experiments, however, the capacity to
regenerate GTP has been enhanced and extended up to
several hours [19]. Compared to a typical oscillation pe-

riod during microtubule polymerization, which is of the
order of a minute, the reaction conditions in these ex-
periments are almost quasi–stationary over a long range
of time. Therefore we focus on modeling microtubule
polymerization for time–independent regeneration condi-
tions. As starting point we take common reduced models,
where several elementary processes of the real biochemi-
cal reaction are described by a few eﬀective reaction steps
as explained in Sec. II, cf. Refs. [6,7,15,17]. Reductions
of complex chemical reaction schemes are quite common
and a famous example is the so–called oregonator [20]
that is a reduced model for the legendary Belousov–
Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction [21]. However, since micro-
tubules are long ﬁlaments, there are essential diﬀerences
between the polymerization of microtubules ﬁlaments
and common chemical reactions. For instance micro-
tubules may undergo an orientational ordering transition
beyond a critical ﬁlament density [22], a phenomenon,
which doesn’t occur in common chemical reactions. Ac-
cordingly, the length distribution of microtubules is ex-
plicitly taken into account for all variants of models in-
vestigated in this work. Such models are the basis of fu-
ture work on interesting pattern–formation phenomena
related to the interplay between orientational ordering of
the ﬁlaments and the kinetics involved in the ﬁlament
growth [23].

In addition, we focus on model variants that include
the possibility of an oscillatory microtubule polymeriza-
tion and that allow analytical approaches. However, the
reaction steps, such as nucleation, growth and decay of
microtubules or the rate limiting factors of oligomer de-
cay or tubulin regeneration, which have been identiﬁed to
be crucial for oscillations [5–8,11], are taken into account.
Moreover we address the question whether microtubule
oscillations occur transiently or in a persistent manner
beyond a Hopf bifurcation. Whether such a Hopf bifur-

1

cation takes place super- or subcritically is investigated
in terms of the so–called amplitude expansion.

It is not a major goal of this work to achieve quanti-
tative agreement between the results obtained with phe-
nomenological models and experimental measurements.
However, since the present understanding of the mecha-
nism leading to oscillatory microtubule polymerization is
incomplete, reduced models may be an appropriate tool
for working out typical trends that may be testable in
experiments. For comparison it is very helpful that for
reduced models trends may be worked out analytically
and may be presented by simple formulae. A number of
spatiotemporal phenomena involving microtubule poly-
merization call for a better understanding too [10,24,25],
but also in this case simple and eﬀective models are in-
dispensable in order to keep the modeling tractable [26].
At the transition to oscillatory polymerization the sta-
tionary state becomes sensitive against small perturba-
eσt. Here the
tions, which grow or decay exponentially,
∝
iωc is the sum of the so–called
exponential factor σ = σr ±
= 0. Be-
growth rate σr and the oscillation frequency ωc 6
low the bifurcation point the growth rate σr < 0 is neg-
ative and the perturbations are damped. Beyond the bi-
furcation point σr is positive and the stationary polymer-
ization state is unstable against oscillatory perturbations.
Hence the Hopf bifurcation to oscillatory polymerization
takes place when the real part σr of both roots passes
zero. The investigation of the polymerization dynam-
ics beyond the Hopf bifurcation requires in most cases a
numerical analysis of the basic reaction equations. How-
ever, close to threshold σr is small and the oscillation of
the polymerization, described by the real part of eiωct, is
much faster than the temporal evolution of the complex
valued amplitude A(t) of the oscillations. Therefore the
oscillation may be written as a product of both factors,
A(t)eiωct, and there is a very general approach,
i.e.
the so–called amplitude expansion, for separating the dy-
namics at these two disparate time scales [27,28]. The
amplitude equation describing the evolution of the am-
plitude A(t) is obtained by a perturbation expansion of
the reaction equations with respect to the slowly varying
amplitude A(t) and it is of the form

∝

τ0∂tA = ε(1 + ia)A

g(1 + ic)

A

The control parameter ε measures the relative distance
from the bifurcation point and τ0 is the relaxation time
deﬁned by τ0 = ε/σr, that depends on the system.
If
the coeﬃcient g of the nonlinear term is positive, the bi-
furcation to the oscillatory state is supercritical and if it
is negative, the bifurcation is subcritical. The imaginary
parts of the prefactors describe the linear and the nonlin-
ear frequency dispersion. Especially about the extension
Eq. (1) including spatial degrees of freedom, there exists a
rich literature as summarized e.g. in a recent review [29].
Here in this work we calculate the coeﬃcients of the uni-
versal equation (1) for microtubule polymerization and
we discuss their variation in terms of the reaction rates.

In the following section II we describe the main steps of
the reaction cycle for microtubule polymerization and the
respective equations for two models are presented. The
time–independent solutions for the stationary polymer-
ization are given for both models analytically in section
III. Those become unstable against oscillatory perturba-
tions in the range of high of tubulin–dimer density. The
respective linear stability analysis and the derivation of
the oscillation threshold are given in section IV, includ-
ing their dependence on the reaction parameters. Read-
ers who are mainly interested in numerical results about
the oscillation threshold may proceed directly to section
IV A 4. The partial diﬀerential equations for growing and
shrinking microtubules are of ﬁrst order in the length mi-
crotubules and ﬁrst order in time. Their straight forward
discretization and numerical solution has to be consid-
ered with care, therefore a stable numerical scheme, that
becomes exact close to the threshold of the Hopf bifur-
cation, is described in section V. The derivation of the
universal equation (1) is outlined in Sec. VI whereas the
technical details are given in appendix A. With a sum-
mary and an outlook about modeling microtubule poly-
merization we conclude this work in Sec. VII.

II. MODELS FOR MICROTUBULE
POLYMERIZATION

−

−

Microtubule assembly and disassembly proceeds in sev-
eral steps [1–3,5,7,8]. Aggregation of guanosine triphos-
phate (GTP) liganded tubulin dimers, the so–called
tubulin–t, to microtubules is started by heating up tubu-
37oC in the
lin solutions to a temperature of about 30
presence of GTP. Then microtubules spontaneously nu-
cleate and polymerize to long rigid polymers made up of
α
β tubulin dimers. An increasing number of long mi-
crotubules in a solvent causes an increasing turbidity and
the amount of polymerized tubulin–t may be monitored
by measuring this turbidity [6] or by X-ray scattering
[8]. The nucleation of microtubules is a rather complex
process and it is still a matter of debate whether the nu-
cleation rate depends in experiments only on the initial
concentration of tubulin-t, ct, or during the polymeriza-
tion on the temporally varying ct [3,30]. But once micro-
tubules are formed, they grow and the available tubulin–
t dimers will be used up. The growth velocity of mi-
crotubules, vg, is rather sensitive to temperature varia-
tions but it is rather independent on ct [30,31]. Growing
microtubules may change their state to rapidly depoly-
merizing ones by the so–called catastrophe rate fcat. In
previous works for the catastrophe rate mostly an expo-
nential dependence on the tubulin–t concentration was
ct/cf ) with some constant cf
assumed, i.e. fcat ∼
[6,15]. Once microtubules have changed from growth to
shrinking, they shrink rather quickly with a large velocity
vs ≫
During the depolymerization of microtubules they are
fragmented into oligomers or directly into guanosine

vg.

diphosphate (GDP) liganded tubulin dimers, the so–
called tubulin-d dimers. The oligomers themselves are
believed to fragment further into tubulin–d dimers and
the decay rate depends on the free GTP and GDP.
Oligomers are stabilized by GDP and destabilized by
GTP [8,11].
If an excess of GTP is available, then
tubulin–d in solution will exchange its unit of GDP for
GTP and each tubulin–t dimer resulting from such an
exchange step is identical to the initial tubulin–t dimer.
Such a regeneration step completes the whole micro-
tubule polymerization cycle.
If a continuous source of
GTP is provided, for instance by a regeneration process,
this cycling may be continued over a long time [19]. The
variation of the reaction rates of the polymerization cy-
cle with the concentration ct may depend on the speciﬁc
experiment.

FIG. 1. Two models for the cycle of microtubule polymer-
ization. Model I (upper cycle): Tubulin–t dimers may spon-
taneously form nuclei of microtubule that grow further by
incorporating tubulin–t dimers. A growing microtubule may
also change its state to a quickly depolymerizing one by the
so–called catastrophe rate fcat, but it may also change back
to the polymerizing state by a so–called and rather small res-
cue rate fresc. Tubulin–d dimers are released during this
microtubule depolymerization and the whole cycle becomes
closed by regenerating them by a rate α back to tubulin–t
dimers. Model II (lower cycle): Here the intermediate step of
shrinking microtubules is replaced by oligomers e.g. micro-
tubule break oﬀ with a rate fcat directly into oligomers and
the oligomers themselves may break oﬀ with the rate χ into
tubulin–d dimers. The rest of the cycle is identical with the
upper cycle.

There are rather detailed models available to describe
this reaction cycle of microtubule polymerization, see e.g.
[15]. As a simpliﬁcation of this complex biochemical re-
action we only take into account as rate limiting factors
one of the two intermediate steps of the polymerization
cycle, either the dynamics of shrinking microtubules (up-
per cycle in Fig. 1) or the decay dynamics of oligomers
(lower cycle in Fig. 1). Without both rate rate limit-
ing factors there are no microtubule oscillations, but one
is suﬃcient for oscillations. The two simpliﬁed reaction
schemes, as sketched in Fig. 1, are analyzed in detail in
this work.

A. Dynamics of growing microtubules

During microtubule polymerization there are many
growing ﬁlaments in a unit volume and their length distri-
bution may be described by a length and time–dependent
function pg(l, t) whose detailed form varies with the ex-
perimental conditions. A simple model for the dynam-
ics of distribution of growing microtubules pg(l, t) is de-
scribed by the following ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation
[13,14]

∂tpg =

fcat pg −

−

vg

∂pg
∂l

.

(2)

fcat describes either the transition from the growing to
the shrinking state of microtubules (model I) or the de-
cay of growing microtubules into oligomers (model II).
vg is the growth velocity of the microtubules.

1. Growth velocity and catastrophe rate

In recent experiments with high tubulin–t concentra-
tion the growth velocity vg was rather independent of
ct [30]. Since we are mainly interested in the oscilla-
tory behavior of microtubule polymerization, that occurs
at high ct–concentrations, we assume a constant vg in
this work. In most of the present models a ct–dependent
catastrophe rate fcat is crucial for oscillatory polymeriza-
tion of microtubules. Rather common is an exponential
ct–dependence [15]

fcat(ct) = f e

−ct/cf ,

(3)

with the amplitude f and the decay constant cf . How-
ever, also a linear ct–dependence
fcat(ct) = ¯f (cu −

ct) ,

(4)

with an appropriate constant cu > ct leads to an oscilla-
tory microtubule polymerization as we show in Sec. IV A.
A hyperbolic ct–dependence of fcat, as discussed in
Ref. [16], also supports oscillating polymerization.

2. Nucleation and boundary conditions

The nucleation process of microtubules is rather com-
plex and it has been investigated in more detail in Refs.
[12,31,32], recently. The nucleation rate ν depends on the
initial concentration c0 of tubulin dimers, but it is rather
independent of the temporal variation of ct, as observed
in recent experiments [30,3]. Accordingly, for a given
initial concentration c0 we assume a constant nucleation
rate ν. The nucleation rate ν itself deﬁnes a boundary
condition for the length distribution of growing micro-
tubules pg(l, t) at l = 0,

pg(l = 0, t) =

ν
vg

.

(5)

B. Model I includes the dynamics of shrinking
microtubules

In model I we take into account as an intermediate step
between growing microtubules and tubulin–d dimers the
dynamics of shrinking microtubules, ps(l, t). Here the
catastrophe rate fcat describes the transition of micro-
tubules from the growing to the shrinking state. The
depolymerization speed vs of shrinking microtubules,
ps(l, t), is mostly much larger than the growth velocity
vg. Having microtubules in two diﬀerent states, one may
also expect a transition from the shrinking back to the
growing state, as described by a rate fresc. So one has
two coupled equations for the growing and shrinking mi-
crotubules [13,14]

fcat pg + fresc ps −

∂tpg =
−
∂tps = fcat pg −

fresc ps + vs∂lps .

vg∂lpg ,

The rescue rate fresc, however, is usually very small in
experiments and therefore it is neglected in this work.
The boundary condition for shrinking microtubules is

ps(l

, t) = 0 ,

→ ∞

because the transition from growing to shrinking micro-
tubules is the only source for the shrinking ones and
pg(l

, t) vanishes for large values of l.

The temporal evolution of the concentration of the
tubulin–t dimers ct and tubulin–d dimers cd is described
by two equations as follows

of tubulin dimers that are incorporated in a unit length
of microtubules. ct is regenerated from cd by exchange
the unit GDP for GTP and this regeneration process,
described by the rate α, occurs in Eq. (8a) as a source
and in Eq. (8b) as a sink. Tubulin–d dimers are released
during the depolymerization of microtubules ps(l, t) and
this source is described by the integral in Eq. (8b).

Tubulin dimers may be a constituent of growing or
shrinking microtubules or they carry GTP or GDP as
single dimers, but altogether they are conserved as ex-
pressed by the condition

ct + cd + γL = c0 .

(9)

Here c0 describes the overall concentration of tubulin
dimers and L(t) is the integrated length of all micro-
tubules per unit volume

The tubulin–d concentration cd may be eliminated from
Eq. (8a) by using the conservation condition (9). On
the other hand Eq. (9) in combination with Eqs. (6) and
Eq. (8a) yield an equation that is identical with Eq. (8b).
Hence Eqs. (6a) and (6b) together with

This simpliﬁed model reproduces essential aspects of sta-
tionary polymerization of microtubules as described in
Sec. III.

C. Model II includes the dynamics of oligomers

Oligomers occur as an intermediate product during the
decay of microtubules and they are made of several tubu-
lin dimers. This intermediate product is ignored in model
I. Here in model II, after the so–called catastrophe, we
ignore the dynamics of shrinking microtubules as an in-
termediate step and instead we take into account the (de-
cay) dynamics of oligomers. Therefore, the catastrophe
rate fcat in Eq. (2) describes for model II a direct tran-
sition of growing microtubules into oligomers. Further-
more, it is assumed that oligomers decay with the rate χ
into tubulin–d dimers. The concentration of oligomers is
denoted by coli and its dynamics as well as that of cd are
described by the two equations

η is a measure for the number of oligomers per unit length
of the microtubules and λ is a measure for the number
of tubulin dimers per oligomer. Oligomers decaying with
the rate χ build a source term in the equation for tubulin–
d dimers in Eq. (15b).

The conservation law for the concentration of all tubu-

lin dimers takes the form

ct + cd + λcoli + ηλ

The equation for the growing microtubules is the same
as for model I, cf. Eq. (2), but in the equation for ct,
cf. Eq. (8a), one has to replace the length factor γ by
the product ηλ. Eliminating coli model II is described by

Eq. (2) and Eq. (8a) together with the following dynam-
ical equation for cd

As boundary condition for the growing microtubules we
again use Eq. (5) with a constant nucleation rate ν. For
model II we only consider the catastrophe rate given in
Eq. (3). This again guarantees a nonlinear feedback of
the dynamics of the tubulin–t dimers to the dynamics of
the growing microtubules.

Similar as for model I also model II becomes in the
limit χ
identical with the model described by
Eqs. (14).
If we assume a very fast dissociation of
1, we can neglect
oligomers into tubulin–d dimers, χ
the intermediate state coli. In this case the source term
in equation (15b), χλ coli, can be replaced by the source
∞
0 dl l pg, which describes
in equation (15a), cf. ηλfcat
the direct decay of growing microtubules into tubulin–d
R
dimers. After replacing cd and setting γ = ηλ in Eq. (8a),
we again obtain with the help of the conservation law (16)
the simple reduced model as described by the equations
(14).

III. STATIONARY SOLUTIONS

A polymerization cycle with a stationary length distri-
bution of microtubules and time–independent dimer con-
centrations ct, cd or oligomer concentration coli are one
type of the solutions of the model equations described
in the previous section II. For this stationary state the
various polymerization steps, such as nucleation, assem-
bly and disassembly of microtubules as well as the re-
generation of tubulin-d dimers are in a balanced state.
Under certain conditions a stationary polymerization is
observed in experiments [31]. However, it may become
unstable against oscillatory perturbations if the initial
tubulin dimer concentration c0 is large enough, as shown
in the following section IV.

A. Model I

Eqs. (6) are ﬁrst order linear diﬀerential equations with
respect to the length l and in the stationary case these
equations have exponentially decaying solutions, which

is determined self–
consistently as described below. The stationary solu-

Stationary solutions for model II can be calculated in
a similar manner as discussed in the previous section for
model I. The length distribution of growing microtubules
is again given by Eq. (18) and the integral in Eq. (17)
can be calculated analytically.
cd may be eliminated
from Eq. (17) by using Eq. (8a) with ˙ct = 0 and by set-

IV. THRESHOLD FOR OSCILLATORY
POLYMERIZATION

Stationary microtubule polymerization becomes unsta-
ble against oscillating modes in the range of high tubulin
dimer concentrations c0 and the parameter range where

for the stationary
polymerization state of model I is shown as a function of the

In the range of α much larger than the catastrophe rate
f (0)
cat the stationary tubulin–t concentration c(0)
t becomes
independent of it, because all tubulin–d dimers, that are
released during the depolymerization, are immediately
regenerated to tubulin–t dimers. Both a large nucleation
rate ν and a large growth velocity vg lead to a high con-
sumption of tubulin–t and therefore to a lower station-
ary concentration c(0)
. This tendency is illustrated by
the diﬀerence between the two curves in Figure 2. On
the other hand, large values of the amplitude of the re-
spective catastrophe rate, either f or ¯f , act against long

numerically for various parameter combinations and in
limiting cases also analytically.

This polynomial describes the linear stability of the sta-
tionary solutions given by Eq. (18) and Eq. (19) com-
pletely and they are unstable in the parameter range
where the growth rate becomes positive, Re(σ) > 0.
Keeping for instance all parameters besides the dimer
concentration c0 ﬁxed, then the neutral stability condi-
tion Re(σ) = 0 provides an equation for the critical dimer
concentration c0c. For concentrations larger than this
critical value, c0 > c0c, the stationary solutions are un-
stable.

The smallest critical dimer concentrations c0c for an
oscillatory polymerization are required if the parameters

α,β and G take intermediate values, as discussed in more
detail below. At the threshold the real part Re(σ) = 0
vanishes and the imaginary part of σ is the so-called
Hopf–frequency ωc = Im(σ).
In this special case with
a purely imaginary σ the polynomial in Eq. (32) can be
decomposed into its real and imaginary parts giving two
coupled equations for the determination of the two un-
knowns f (0)

c0c may be calculated via Eq. (19).

2. Limiting cases for the rate in Eq. (4)

The tendencies for the parameter dependence of
the threshold for the Hopf bifurcation as discussed in
Sec. IV A 1 are by far not a special property of the choice
of the catastrophe rate in Eq. (3). Therefore we consider
the same limiting cases as before for the catastrophe rate
given in Eq. (4) and with G as deﬁned in Eq. (31).

This is explained at ﬁrst for the catastrophe rate given

At threshold one has σ = iωc and two equations follow
from the nonlinear dispersion relation in Eq. (32) which
determine the two unknowns ωc and f (0)
cat. The critical
initial concentration c0c follows via f (0)

4. Numerical results for the threshold of model I

Since σ is purely imaginary at the threshold of a Hopf
bifurcation, σ = iωc, the dispersion relation in Eq. (32)
can be decomposed in its real and imaginary part and
from these two equations the critical concentration c0c
and the frequency ωc may be calculated numerically as a
function of the parameters. The numerical calculations
in this section are restricted to the exponential tubulin
dependence of the catastrophe rate as given by Eq. (3).
The critical tubulin dimer concentration c0c and the
critical frequency ωc at the Hopf bifurcation are shown in
Fig. 3 as function of the regeneration rate α and in Fig. 4
as function of the velocity ratio 1/β = vs/vg, whereby
the reduced parameter G has been chosen at the values
G = 3000 and G = 300, respectively. Since G includes
a number of parameters the curves in both ﬁgures repre-
sent a larger parameter set. In the limit of a vanishing
regeneration and in the limit of very large values of α,
where the regeneration process is much faster than any
other process, the critical tubulin concentration c0c di-
verges and therefore the Hopf bifurcation is suppressed.
In addition, both ﬁgures indicate that the smallest values
of the critical tubulin concentration c0c are obtained at
intermediate values of the parameters α, β and G. The
location of the threshold minima, however, depends on
the actual values of the rest of the parameters. The fre-
quency ωc becomes rather small in the limit α
0 and
for large values of α this frequency becomes independent
of it, cf. section IV A 1.

→

In Fig. 4 the threshold minimum is less pronounced
0 the thresh-
than in Fig. 3 and in the limit β = vg/vs →
old c0c increases linearly with vs and in agreement with
limits given in section IV A 1. Accordingly, there is no

→

Hopf bifurcation for the reduced model that follows in
the limit β
0 as described in section II B 2. Hence,
the dynamics of shrinking microtubules is one essential
degree of freedom favoring oscillating microtubule poly-
merization. The dynamics of oligomers, as discussed in
Sec. IV B, is an alternative degree of freedom that favors
oscillations.

FIG. 3. The critical tubulin dimer concentration c0c and
the critical oscillation frequency ωc are given at the threshold
of the Hopf bifurcation as a function of the regeneration rate
α, for two values of β = vg/vs and for the constant G = 3000.
The catastrophe rate given in Eq. (3) has been used with the
parameter values f = 0.1 and cf = 3.

For large values of vs the frequency ωc becomes large
too and the oscillation period becomes much shorter than
any relaxational dynamics of pg and ct. According to the
quick shrinking, the life time of a depolymerizing micro-
tubules vanishes and therefore the amplitude of the den-
1/vs. In
sity of shrinking microtubules is small too, ps ∝
other words, in the limit of large values of vs the inter-
mediate step of shrinking microtubules may be neglected
and the transition from pg to tubulin-d dimers is eﬀec-
tively a direct process as explicitly assumed for the re-
duced model. If either the regeneration or the shrinking
dynamics becomes too fast, the Hopf bifurcation is sup-
pressed. The two intermediate steps, the depolymeriza-
tion and the regeneration, act obviously as antagonistic
steps or jam processes that favors oscillations.

FIG. 4. The critical tubulin concentration c0c and the fre-
quency ωc are given at the Hopf bifurcation as a function of
the ratio between the shrinking and growth velocity of mi-
−1 , for α = 0.05 and for two diﬀerent
crotubules, vs/vg = β
values of G. The ct–dependence of the catastrophe rate as
given in Eq. (3) has been used with the same parameters as
in Fig. 3.

The phase diﬀerence between the oscillations of
tubulin–t and the oscillations of the total amount of poly-
merized tubulin, described by L(t) in Eq. (10), is another
experimentally accessible quantity [33]. The diﬀerence
between the phases of the oscillatory contributions of cd
and ct as well as the diﬀerence between the phases of
L(t) and ct are given in Fig. 5. These phase diﬀerences
as well as the ratios between the amplitudes of the ﬁelds,
cf.
lower part of Fig. 5, are calculated at the threshold
of the Hopf bifurcation by using the analytical solutions
calculated in Sec. IV A 3.

For large values of α, tubulin–d is quickly regener-
ated into tubulin–t and therefore the density cd becomes
smaller as shown by the lower part in Fig. 5. In the op-
posite limit of small values of α tubulin–t is consumed by
nucleation and growth of microtubules, but the source,
which is supplied by the regeneration of tubulin–d, de-
cays and therefore one obtains large values for the ratio
between the amplitude of c(1)
as well as between
the amplitudes of L(1) and c(1)

The phase shifts of cd and L(t) with respect to the
phase of ct are rather independent of the regeneration
rate α as shown in Fig. 5. The absolute values of these
shifts are in qualitative agreement with the expectation
as described in the following. At the maximum of ct
the catastrophe rate takes its minimum and therefore,
since the nucleation and the growth velocity are constant,
L(t) is increasing for a while and up to the moment when
enough ct is consumed and the catastrophe rate increases
again. Due to an increasing decay of microtubules the
maximum of the latter will also lead to a delayed max-
imum for cd. For large values of α the amount of poly-
merized tubulin is nearly in anti phase with respect to ct,
which is also mentioned in Ref. [15]. The slightly stronger
α–dependence of the phase diﬀerence between L(t) and

10

ct is mainly due to the α-dependence of shrinking micro-
tubules ps, because the relative phase of p(1)
is nearly
g
independent of α (see also Section IV B).

that determines the linear stability of the stationary poly-
merization for model II. Again we are interested in the
neutrally stable case, Re(σ) = 0, that separates the sta-
ble from the unstable regime. At the neutral stability
point of the Hopf bifurcation one has ωc = Im(σ) and
Eq. (44) can be decomposed into its real and imaginary
part. From these two equations f (0)
cat and ωc are deter-
mined by standard methods. c0c may be calculated via
Eq. (22).

At the Hopf bifurcation the non-stationary part of
growing microtubules is again described by the distribu-
tion given by Eq. (37b) and the ﬁelds coli and cd are not
in phase with ct in general. The two ﬁelds may be writ-

the polymerized tubulin L(1)(t) with respect to c(1)
is
rather independent of α, whereas the phase of oligomer
oscillations change slightly with α. A phase shift π be-
tween the polymerized tubulin and oligomers is measured
in experiments, cf. Refs. [12] and [34]. In this model this
is only possible in the limit of a dissociation rate χ much
smaller than the regeneration rate α.

2. Numerical results for the threshold of model II

At the threshold one has again σ = iωc and from the
imaginary together with the real part of the dispersion
relation in Eq. (44) the critical concentration c0c and the
Hopf frequency ωc may be calculated as function of the
parameters. Also for model II we restrict our numerical
calculations to the catastrophe rate with the exponential
dependence given in Eq. (3).

→

the reduced parameter G the value G = 3000 has been
chosen. Since G includes a number of parameters the
curves in both parts represent a larger parameter set.
For a ﬁxed ﬁnite value for χ in the limit of a vanish-
ing regeneration α
0, where the polymerization cycle
is interrupted, and in the limit of very large values of
α, where the regeneration process is much faster than
any other process, the critical tubulin concentration c0c
diverges similar as for model I and therefore the Hopf
bifurcation is suppressed. If α is kept ﬁxed at a medium
value the threshold curve c0c(χ) as function of the decay
rate χ for oligomers has a similar shape as shown as func-
tion of α in Fig. 6. The critical tubulin concentration c0c
also takes its smallest values at intermediate values of α,
χ and G, whereby the location of the threshold minima
depends on the actual values of the rest of parameters.
With a decreasing rate α
0 of tubulin regeneration
→
also the frequency ωc becomes small. On the other hand
for large values of α the tubulin regeneration is not any-
more a rate limiting factor and the critical frequency ωc
becomes rather independent of α , cf. section IV A 1.

and the critical frequency ωc are shown at the Hopf bifur-
cation as a function of the regeneration rate α and for two
diﬀerent values of the decay rate χ of oligomers. The rest of
the parameters are G = 3000, f = 0.1 and cf = 3.

The critical tubulin concentration c0c and the critical
frequency ωc at the Hopf bifurcation are shown in Fig. 6
as function of the regeneration rate α and for two diﬀer-
ent values of the decay rate of oligomers χ, whereby for

L(1)(t) (dashed) with respect to the tubulin-t concentration

is shown as a function of the regeneration rate α. The

other parameters are G = 3000 and χ = 0.02.

The stability of oligomers and therefore the decay rate
χ depend very much on the available GTP: Increasing
GTP concentrations destabilize oligomers and increase
the decay rate χ [7,11]. With increasing GTP concen-
trations also the rate α of the transition from cd to ct is

12

enhanced. However, if the tubulin regeneration and the
oligomer decay become to quick, an oscillatory polymer-
ization is suppressed. In other words, if one increases α
and χ beyond some minimum values, the threshold con-
centration for tubulin increases too. Such a tendency for
the GTP dependence of the oscillation is in agreement
with the results reported from experiments [7,11,12].

t

d /c(1)

With increasing values of α tubulin–d is again quickly
transfered by the regeneration process into tubulin–t,
leading to a small amplitude ratio c(1)
. Accord-
ingly more tubulin is left to be stored in L(1) and c(1)
oli .
Therefore both increase with larger values of α as indi-
cated in Fig. 7. This has to be compared with L(1) for
model I, where it decays as function of α because the
phase shift between the contributions of the growing and
shrinking microtubules changes too. For model II the rel-
ative phases are also rather independent of α, whereby
due to the quick regeneration of cd the relative phase
between c(1)

is slightly decreasing.

model I and with G = cf /(ηλvgν) for model II. This poly-
nomial in σ has always negative growth rates, Re(σ) < 0,
and therefore stationary solutions are always stable.

V. NUMERICAL METHOD FOR MODEL I

The two diﬀerential equations for growing and shrink-
ing microtubules in (6) are of ﬁrst order with respect
to the length l of the microtubules and ﬁrst order in
time. A straight forward spatial discretization of such
ﬁrst order equations often leads to numerical instabili-
ties. Especially the equation for shrinking microtubules,
cf. Eq. (6b), has problematic stability properties. For
this reason we approximate the solutions of Eqs. (6) by
a two mode ansatz

This approximation becomes exact close to the thresh-

leads to a set of ordinary diﬀerential equations for the

are described in the following.

Due to Eq. (5) one has the boundary condition Fg(l =

take a diﬀerent form, or in the absence of ps a direct
spatial discretization provides also a stable algorithm.
The ﬁve diﬀerential equations for model I in Eq. (54),

FIG. 8. For model I the time–dependence of the tubulin-t
concentration ct(t), the polymerized tubulin γL(t) and the
tubulin-d concentration cd(t) is shown in parts a), b) and c),
respectively. The parameters ν = 0.01, α = 0.01, β = 0.1
were used with the corresponding critical initial concentra-
tion c0c = 80.69. The reduced control parameter is chosen
at the value ε = 0.01. In part d) the length distribution of
the microtubule P (l) = pg(l) + ps(l) is shown at two diﬀerent
times t = 876 (solid) and t = 975 (dashed), where γL(t) takes
its maximum and minimum, respectively.

ously have diﬀerent phases. The extrema (maxima) of
the polymerized tubulin L(t) and the tubulin–d concen-
tration cd(t) are delayed with respect to the extrema of
the tubulin–t concentration ct(t), a behavior that is al-
ready indicated by the reaction cycle shown in Fig. 1. At
the threshold the parameter dependence of these phase
diﬀerences may be calculated from the formulas given in
Sec. IV A 3 and Sec. IV B 1. In Fig. 5 and in Fig. 7 these
phases are shown as function of the regeneration rate α.
In Fig. 8 the initial concentration of tubulin c0 was cho-
sen very close to the threshold c0c with ε = 0.01. At this
value of the control parameter the oscillations behave
harmonically and the agreement between the numerical
solution and the amplitude approximation is rather good,
as described in the following section. For larger values
of the reduced control parameter the oscillations become
anharmonic.

The time–dependence of the ﬁelds of model I are shown

As already been mentioned in the introduction, the
length distribution of ﬁlaments is a crucial diﬀerence be-
tween the biochemical reaction discussed in this work and

the common oscillatory chemical reactions. For model I
we show in Fig. 8d) at two diﬀerent times and at ε = 0.01
the superposition of the length distribution of growing
and shrinking microtubules, cf. P (l) = pg(l) + ps(l).
The exponential decay of the envelope of the length dis-
tribution is described by Eq. (37b) and Eq. (37c), with
a decay rate vg/f (0)
cat, and the modulation is due to the
traveling waves in the time–dependent contribution. The
amplitude of the shrinking microtubules is rather small
for β = 0.1, cf. Eq. (37c), and therefore the contribution
to P (l) comes mainly from growing microtubules.

For model II a discretization of the length coordinate
in the equation for growing microtubule, cf. Eq. (2),
also provides a stable numerical algorithm. Hence, the
nonlinear oscillatory solution can be obtained numeri-
cally without the approximations as described for model
I in Eqs. (50) above. The respective results are shown in
Fig. 9a)-c), where the densities L, ct and coli are shown as
function of time for three diﬀerent regeneration rates α.
For both values of α in part a) and b) the tubulin con-
centration is smaller than the corresponding threshold
c0c to the thresh-
value but the absolute distance c0 −
old is equal. These transient subthreshold–oscillations
are remarkable, because the transient oscillations in ex-
periments might be subthreshold ones in contrast to the
common interpretation that the oscillations are transient
due to the tubulin–t consumption during the microtubule
polymerization.

For the simulations shown in Fig. 9 a narrow length
distribution pg has been used as initial condition.
In
such cases the tubulin-t concentration corresponds al-
most to the total initial concentration c0. Starting with
such an initial condition, at ﬁrst tubulin–t dimers are
consumed during the growth of microtubules. This leads
to a ﬁrst maximum of the polymerized tubulin L, but
the oligomers, the decay product of the microtubules, are
negligible and as consequence the densities of tubulin-d
and tubulin-t drop down too. But a small ct increases
the catastrophe rate fcat and microtubules decay with a
higher rate, which increases the density of oligomers etc..
After a few of such oscillations the densities reach their
stationary values for subthreshold concentrations. In the
case of a large regeneration rate the oscillation frequency
is much higher than for small regeneration rates and more
oscillations are performed until the stationary values are
reached. The stationary value of the polymerized tubulin
and of the oligomers is also much larger in part b) than
in part a) whereas the stationary value for the tubulin–t
dimers remains nearly constant. The reason is the low
density cd in the case of large values of α.

Far beyond the threshold of the Hopf bifurcation, the
oscillations become anharmonic as shown in Fig. 9c).
Hereby the oscillations of the total polymerization and of
their decay product, coli, are nearly in antiphase, similar
as in experiments described in Ref. [7]. At the threshold
a phase diﬀerence of π was only possible in the limit of
large regeneration rates α and for a much smaller disso-

ciation rate χ. If we consider initial concentrations which
are much larger than the corresponding critical concen-
tration, the phase shift of π between L(t) and coli(t) is
also possible at intermediate values of χ and α.

In Fig. 9d) the distribution for growing microtubules
pg(l) is shown for model II at three diﬀerent times. The
reduced control parameter ε = 0.21 is rather large com-
pared to its value in Fig. 8 and the curves indicate that
the length distribution of microtubules isn’t described
anymore by harmonic traveling waves as in the vicinity
of the bifurcation. As long as the tubulin-t density is
large and the catastrophe rate small, microtubules grow
with a constant velocity vg and only a few of them ex-
perience a catastrophe. During this period a plateau in
the length distribution is build. But after a large amount
of tubulin-t has been used up the catastrophe rate fcat
increases very steeply leading to a strong decay of the
microtubules at all lengths. If fcat drops down again the
low density of long microtubules grow further with a con-
stant velocity vg and short microtubules are nucleated at
a higher density. This leads to a step in the distribution
that travels with the growth velocity vg to larger values
of l. Therefore, far beyond the oscillatory threshold the
temporally anharmonic behavior of ct leads in this man-
ner to step–like length distribution of the microtubules.

VI. AMPLITUDE EXPANSION

Here we focus on a semi-analytical treatment of the
oscillating polymerization slightly beyond its onset. The
interesting question here is whether the bifurcation to
these oscillations is continuous (supercritical) or discon-
tinuous (subcritical). In physical systems Hopf bifurca-
tions are mostly subcritical [27,35], but for the models
discussed in this work we always ﬁnd a supercritical one.
This is advantageous, because for a supercritical Hopf
bifurcation a semi–analytical treatment is possible. The
appropriate frame work is the universal amplitude equa-
tion of oscillatory ﬁelds, cf. Eq. (1). This equation will
be derived in the present section from the basic reaction
equations of microtubule polymerization.

The perturbation analysis employed for the derivation
of Eq. (1) is an expansion of the solutions of the basic
equations with respect to small amplitudes of the oscil-
latory contributions [27,28]. As a small perturbation pa-
rameter the relative diﬀerence between the actual tubulin
concentration c0 and the critical tubulin concentration
c0c is introduced

Close to the threshold one has Re(σ)

the linear solution u(1)

very small amount during one oscillation period 2π/ωc.
These two disparate time scales near the threshold, that
2π/ωc) and that of growth
of the oscillation period (
and decay (
1/ε), may be separated within a perturba-
tion expansion by introducing a slow time scale T = εt
[27,28]. The fast time scale is included in the exponential
function eiωct and the other one will be described by a
slowly varying amplitude B(T ). Accordingly the linear
solution near threshold may be written as

∝

u(1)(t, T ) = B(T ) ue eiωct + c.c. .

In order to diﬀerentiate this product of time dependent
functions, instead of applying the chain rule of diﬀeren-
tiation, one may replace this operation by the following

sum ∂t →
dependence occurring in the exponential function and ∂T
acts only on the amplitude B(T ).

Using this replacement and the ε-expansion of u the
basic equations given in Sec. II can be ordered with re-
spect to powers of √ε. In this way we obtain a hierar-
chy of partial diﬀerential equations, which we need up to
(ε3/2). The whole procedure is described in more detail

τ0 is the relaxation time, a is the linear and c is the non-
linear frequency shift. The nonlinear coeﬃcient g deter-
mines the bifurcation structure. For g > 0 the bifurcation
is supercritical (steady) and for g < 0 the bifurcation is
subcritical (unsteady). For the coeﬃcients τ0, a, g and c
one obtains long expressions in terms of the reaction con-
stants of the basic equations, that have been calculated
by using computer algebra. The respective formulas are
not presented but the parameter dependence of the coef-
ﬁcients is shown in Fig. 10 for model I and in Fig. 11 for

The linear coeﬃcients τ0 and a of Eq. (64) may directly
be calculated from the dispersion relation in Eq. (29) or
Eq. (44) in the following way. The solution A = 0 of
Eq. (64) corresponds to the stationary polymerization
described in Sec. III, which is in the range ε < 0 stable

and unstable for ε > 0. Neglecting in Eq. (64) the con-
tributions due to the cubic nonlinearity one obtains from
its linear part the dispersion relation σ = ε(1 + ia)/τ0.
This formula gives the relaxation time τ0 and the lin-
ear frequency dispersion a in terms of derivatives of the
growth rate with respect to the control parameter ε:
τ0 = (∂Re(σ)/∂ε)−1 and a = τ0∂Re(σ)/∂ε. If ε is ex-
pressed in terms of the dimer density c0, cf. Eq. (59),
then both quantities may also be written in terms of the
derivatives with respect to c0

whereby both derivatives are taken at the threshold con-
centration c0c. The dispersion relation σ(ε) as obtained
on the one hand by the amplitude equation and on the
other hand by solving Eq. (29) or Eq. (44), both have
to reproduce the growth or decay dynamics of small per-
turbations with respect to the stationary polymerization.
Therefore, the coeﬃcients τ0 and a of the amplitude equa-
tion can directly be calculated via Eq. (66) from the nu-
merical solutions of Eq. (29) or Eq. (44).

One aim of the amplitude expansion is the determina-
tion of the type of the Hopf bifurcation. For two diﬀerent
nucleation rates ν = 0.01 and ν = 0.04 the variation of
the nonlinear coeﬃcient g as function of the regenera-
tion rate α is shown for model I in Fig. 10 (top) and
for model II with oligomer dynamics in Fig. 11. In both
cases g behaves rather similar and g is positive for the
models investigated in this work. Therefore the Hopf
bifurcation is supercritical. In Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 the
nonlinear coeﬃcient g increases at ﬁrst with the regener-
ation rate α and reaches a maximum in a range where the
threshold concentration c0c(α) takes its minimum. The
corresponding threshold curves c0c(α) for two diﬀerent
nucleation rates ν = 0.01 and ν = 0.04 also cross each
other. Beyond this maximum of g ( where c0c(α) takes
its minimum) decreases again.

16

It should be mentioned that for a given value of the
control parameter ε a large value of g corresponds to a
small value of the oscillation amplitude. Since the thresh-
old c0c(α) varies too, the variation of the oscillation am-
plitude with α is much less when c0cε is kept constant.
According to the sign of the nonlinear coeﬃcient c the os-
cillation frequency ωc+Ω decreases with increasing values
of ε. The results in terms of the amplitude equation are
in fairly good agreement with the behavior of the full
numerical solution of the basic reaction equations.

A determination of the bifurcation structure by nu-
merical simulations of the basic equations is error prone
compared to results of perturbation calculation described
here. Besides the lower accuracy, parameter studies such
as in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 are with numerical simulations
much more time consumptive.

equation is valid in a rather large range of the control pa-
rameter ε, but for other systems its validity is restricted
to very small values of it, cf. Ref. [27]. In order to check
this for our models of microtubule polymerization, we
compare in Fig. 12 the variation of the oscillation am-
plitude of c(1)
t with the control parameter ε as obtained
by the numerical solution described in Sec. V and by the
solution A =
ε/g of the amplitude equation for two
diﬀerent values of the nucleation rate ν. At larger values
of the control parameter, ε = 0.1, the diﬀerence between
the results for the numerical solution and the amplitude
equation is still less than 8%. For model II the devi-
ations are larger between the amplitude determined by
the amplitude equations approach and the numerical so-
lutions with ansatz in Eq. (52). However, when we solve
the equation for growing microtubule, cf. Eq. (2), nu-
merically by discretization of the length coordinate, the
deviations becomes smaller.

been used are γ = 1, α = 0.01, vg = 0.1, β = 0.1, f = 0.1,
cf = 3.

For both models, the linear coeﬃcient τ0 and the non-
linear coeﬃcients g, c don’t diﬀer very much from each
other. However, the linear frequency shift a increases in
model II for large regeneration rates α whereas for model
I it decreases. Nevertheless in both models the nonlinear
frequency correction due to the values of c is much larger
than the linear correction due to a, c >> a.

Whether the bifurcation to oscillatory polymerization
is also supercritical in experiments under stationary re-
generation conditions, is an open question. Therefore
an experimental determination of the bifurcation–type
would be an important test for the reduced models in-
vestigated in this work.

The variation of the other coeﬃcients with the re-
generate α provides further contact between the model

18

parameters and experimentally measurable quantities.
The parameters c, a and τ0 may be determined as
follows. Studying the growth of small perturbations,
c(1)
eRe(σ)t = eεt/τ0 by plotting the logarithm εt/τ0 ∝
t ∝
log(c(1)
t ) as function of time and for diﬀerent values of ε,
the relaxation time τ0 may be determined. In a similar
manner a may be determined by studying the frequency
of a perturbation far below its nonlinear saturation am-
plitude. If the perturbation saturates ﬁnally, the oscilla-
tion frequency of the nonlinear solution changes with ε as
indicated by Eq. (65). From this ε–dependence the non-
linear coeﬃcient c may be extracted. An experimental
determination of these coeﬃcients, as described, would
be a further test of the basic model equations.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Two reduced models, that capture oscillating micro-
tubule polymerization and the length distribution of the
microtubule ﬁlaments, as described in Sec. II, have been
analyzed. In both models the complex biochemical re-
action steps of microtubule polymerization are described
by a few ones, which have been identiﬁed in experiments
to be important. The focus on a few essential degrees of
freedom leads to some simplicity of the models that al-
lows for instance a derivation of analytical expressions for
the threshold and the oscillation frequency at the Hopf
bifurcation. Such analytical results make trends as func-
tion of the reaction rates more easily visible. Some of
these trends may be tested in experiments and some of
the reaction constants may be measured.

At threshold also analytical expressions could be de-
rived for the temporal evolution of the concentrations
and the length distribution of microtubules. Those pro-
vide a detailed picture about the temporal variation of
the ﬁelds, their relative phases and the amplitude ratios
between them. The formula for the length distribution
is especially instructive, cf. Eq. (37b), it describes a su-
perposition of amplitude oscillations of the distribution
and traveling waves, where the waves always travel to-
wards larger lengths. This qualitative behavior of the
length distribution during oscillatory polymerization is
rather independent of the respective model and it is a
rather general feature. A few snap shots of the numer-
ically generated distribution far beyond threshold are
shown in Fig. 9b). The distribution includes still travel-
ing waves, but far beyond threshold these behave rather
anharmonic.

For stationary reaction conditions, as assumed in this
work, Fig. 9 shows a remarkable result. In part a) and
b) of this ﬁgure a subthreshold concentration for tubu-
lin was assumed, i.e. c0 < c0c, and in both cases the
ﬁnal state is stationary polymerization. However, on the
route to the stationary state transient oscillations occur.
Therefore, the transient character of the microtubule os-
cillations observed in an experiment with an enzymatic

regeneration process for GTP [11], could have, according
to the results described in this work, its origin in a to low
tubulin concentration. A higher tubulin concentration or
an appropriate regeneration rate of GTP and a diﬀerent
live time of oligomers could lead in a similar experiment
to persistent microtubule oscillations.

For transient oscillations observed in other experi-
ments the common interpretation is as follows. During
the microtubule polymerization in experiments the avail-
able GTP is used up and the oscillations last only for
a few periods. If GTP is continuously supplied, the si-
multaneously increasing amount of GTD inhibits various
reactions steps and slows down the reaction cycle. The
results shown in Fig. 9 a) and Fig. 9 b) indicate that os-
cillations may occur as a transient because either GTP
is used up or the tubulin concentration has only a sub-
threshold value. Accordingly, there may be several rea-
sons for transient oscillations in experiments. Either the
initial tubulin concentration has a subthreshold value,
the decay rate of oligomers and the regeneration rate for
GTP do not have their optimal values which would ex-
plain transient oscillations in experiments with a regen-
erative enzyme system, the reaction conditions are not
constant, because GTP is used up. In the latter case the
available tubulin–t decreases with time and the micro-
tubule polymerization decays.

In an in vitro experiment with constant reaction con-
ditions the threshold of oscillations might be measured
by increasing the tubulin dimer concentration by appro-
priate steps.
Immediately after each step transient os-
cillations might occur, but the threshold is only crossed
when the oscillations persist over a long time.

In order to avoid numerical instabilities during long
time simulations of the reaction equations,
including
Eq. (6b), we use analytical approximations for the length
dependence of the microtubule distributions as described
in Sec. V. This stable numerical scheme can be general-
ized in future work to an eﬀective algorithm for dealing
with microtubule polymerization in one and two spatial
dimensions [26] in order to investigate spatial patterns
occurring during polymerization of microtubules [10,24].
The respective extension of the amplitude equation may
also lead to new interesting insights.

Microtubule ﬁlaments at a high density show a
isotropic–nematic phase transition [22], similar as it has
been observed for F-actin ﬁlaments [36].
Since the
early theory of Onsager [37] this transition for rods in
a solvent is a well understood phenomenon [38]. For a
monodisperse distribution of ﬁlaments of ﬁxed length,
i.e. without polymerization kinetics, many aspects of the
isotropic–nematic transition have been understood. For
polydisperse rod mixtures some aspects of the isotropic-
nematic transition can be considered to be understood
too [39]. The eﬀects of nucleation, growth of ﬁlaments
and the decay of ﬁlaments on the isotropic–nematic
transition are not known at present and one may ex-
pect interesting phenomena related to this kinetics [23].
The eﬀect of oscillating microtubule polymerization on

the isotropic–nematic transition is also completely unex-
plored at present and will be investigated in forthcoming
works [23].

It is a great pleasure to thank M. Breidenich, H. Fly-
vbjerg, E. Mandelkow, H. M¨uller–Krumbhaar, J. Prost
and J. Tabony for interesting discussions.

APPENDIX A: AMPLITUDE EXPANSION FOR
MODEL I

For model I and the catastrophe rate given in Eq. (3)
the major steps of the derivation of the amplitude equa-
tion (1) are described in this appendix. Since we neglect
the rescue of shrinking microtubules, fresc = 0, the only
nonlinear term in the basic equations of model I is the
product fcat(ct) pg in Eq. (6). At ﬁrst we expand the
concentrations ct, c0 and length distributions pg,s with
respect to deviations from their stationary value at the
threshold for oscillation, such as for instance for the
t +. . ..
tubulin-t concentration, i.e. ct−
Note that the tilded ﬁelds diﬀer just by a power of √ε
from the untilded ﬁelds as introduced in Sec. IV, cf.
(√ε)j ˜c(j)
etc. . In order to simplify the notation
of this appendix we drop the “tilde” and the expansion
of the catastrophe rate takes the form

The two ﬁelds p(3)
have to be calculated ex-

plicitly at this order from Eq. (A6a) and Eq. (A6b)
as well. With both solutions the integral on the right
hand side of Eq. (A6c) can be calculated. Eq. (A6a)
and Eq. (A6b) include both contributions proportional to
eiωct and e3iωct, but only the single harmonic terms are
relevant in Eq. (A6c). The coeﬃcient of eiωct in Eq. (A6c)
must vanish. Part of it vanishes automatically, because it
reproduces the threshold condition and the rest provides
the amplitude equation with all the coeﬃcients now given
in terms of the reaction rates of the basic equations.

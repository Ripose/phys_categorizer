Abstract

This letter studies synchronization conditions for distributed dynamic networks with diﬀer-
ent types of leaders. The role of a leader specifying a desired global state trajectory through
local interactions (the power leader) has long been recognized and modeled. This paper in-
troduces the complementary notion of a ’knowledge’ leader holding information on the target
dynamics, which is propagated to the entire network through local adaptation mechanisms.
Knowledge-based leader-followers networks have many analogs in biology, e.g. in evolutionary
processes and disease propagation. Diﬀerent types of leaders can co-exist in the same network.

1 Introduction

Recent results in the theoretical study of synchronization and group cooperation [3, 7, 9, 17, 19,
22, 23, 24, 25] have greatly helped in understanding distributed networked systems in the nature
world. In these systems, each element can only get local information from a set of neighbors and the
whole network is able to present a collective behavior. Examples of such networked systems pervade
nature at every scale, including neural networks, pacemaker cells, ﬂashing ﬁreﬂies, chirping crickets,
and the aggregate motions of bird ﬂocks, ﬁsh schools, animal herds and bee swarms, just to cite
a few. For a diﬀusion-coupled network with arbitrary size and general structure, [22, 25] provides
an explicit synchronization condition by setting a coupling-strength threshold, which is computed
based on network connectivity and uncoupled element dynamics.

For a leaderless network composed of peers, the phase of its collective behavior is hard to predict,
since it depends on the initial conditions of all the coupled elements. Thus, for the whole network
to behave as desired, an additional group leader is necessary. Here the leader is deﬁned as the one
whose dynamics is independent and thus followed by all the others. Such a leader-followers network
is especially popular in natural aggregate motions, where the leader “tells” the followers “where to
go”. We name this kind of leader the power leader. The synchronization condition for a dynamic
network with a power leader was derived in [22, 25] and will be brieﬂy reviewed here.

In this letter, we introduce a new leader role, which we call a knowledge leader. In a knowledge-
based network, members’ dynamics are initially non-identical and mutually coupled. The leader is
the one whose dynamics is ﬁxed or changes comparatively slowly. The followers obtain dynamics
knowledge from the leader through adaptation. In this sense, a knowledge leader can be understood
as the one who indicates “how to go”.
In fact, knowledge leaders may exist in many natural
processes. For instance, in evolutionary biology [16, 18], the adaptive model we describe could
represent genotype-phenotype mapping. Similar is infectious-disease dynamics [12]. Knowledge
leaders may also exist in animal aggregate motion as a junior or injured member with limited
capacities. Diﬀerent than a power leader, a knowledge leader does not have to be dynamically
independent. It may be located at any position in a network. Using Lyapunov analysis, we will derive

1

the conditions of synchronization and also dynamics-convergence for knowledge-based networks. We
will then show that diﬀerent types of leaders can co-exist in the same network.

2 Power Leader

Consider the dynamics of a coupled network containing one power leader and n power followers

˙x0 = f (x0, t)

Xj∈Ni

˙xi = f (xi, t) +

Kji (xj − xi) + γi K0i (x0 − xi)

i = 1, . . . , n

(1)

Here vector x0 ∈ Rm is the state of the leader whose dynamics is independent, and xi the state
of the ith follower. Vector function f represents the uncoupled dynamics, which is assumed to be
identical for each element. For notation simplicity, the coupling forces are set to be diﬀusive, where
all coupling gains are symmetric positive deﬁnite, and the couplings between the followers are bi-
directional with Kji = Kij if both i, j 6= 0. Ni denotes the set of peer-neighbors of element i, which
for instance could be deﬁned as the set of the followers within a certain distance around element
i. γi is equal to either 0 or 1, representing the connection from the leader to the followers. In our
model, the network connectivity can be very general. Thus Ni and γi can be deﬁned arbitrarily. An
example is illustrated in Figure 1(a).

Figure 1: The graphs illustrate networked systems with (a). a power leader (the most left node);
(b). a knowledge leader (the hollow node); (c). both leaders. The arrows indicate the directions of
the couplings.

Since the dynamics of x0 is independent, it can be considered as an external input to the rest of
the network. Therefore it can be seen as if it contains only the followers and is an undirected graph
with n nodes. We further assume that it has τ inner links.

where the n × τ block matrix D is a generalized incidence matrix by replacing each number 1 or −1
in the incidence matrix [5] with identity matrix I ∈ Rm×m or −I. Note that the incidence matrix is
deﬁned by assigning an arbitrary orientation to the undirected graph. Iτ
Kij is a τ × τ block diagonal
matrix with the kth diagonal entry Kij corresponding to the weight of the kth link which connects

2

the nodes i and j. The proof of Theorem 1 is based on Contraction Theory [10, 11], the details of
which can be found in [22, 25].

A few remarks:

• Theorem 1 can be extended to study networks with unidirectional couplings between the
followers, with positive semi-deﬁnite couplings, or with switching structures [22, 25]. Moreover, as
a generalized understanding, the network does not have to have only one leader. It can be a group
of leading elements. The leader even does not have to be independent. It can receive feedback from
the followers as well. Such an example is synchronization propagation [22], where the density is
not smoothly distributed through the whole network. Since synchronization rate depends on both
coupling strengths and network connectivity, a high-density region will synchronize very quickly
despite disturbances from other parts of the network. The inputs from these leaders then facilitate
synchronization in low-density regions.
• Note that diﬀerent leaders xj

0 of arbitrary dynamics can deﬁne diﬀerent primitives which can

be combined. Contraction of the follower dynamics (i = 1, . . . , n)

˙xi = f (xi, t) +

αj(t) γj

i Kj

0i (xj

0 − xi)

Xj∈Ni

Xj

is preserved if

j αj(t) ≥ 1, ∀t ≥ 0.

• Besides its dubious moral implications, Theorem 1 also means that it is easy to detract a group
from its nominal behavior by introducing a “covert” element, with possible applications to group
control games, ethology, and animal and plant mimicry.

P

• Besides orientation, the moving formation with a power leader has other advantages, such as

energy saving in aerodynamics [1, 20].

3 Knowledge Leader

A knowledge-based leader-followers network is composed of elements with initially non-identical
dynamics. A knowledge leader may be located in any position inside a network as we illustrated in
Figure 1(b). Its dynamics is ﬁxed or slowly changing, while those of the followers are learned from
the leader through adaptation. If we consider the power leader as the one which tells the rest of
the network “where to go”, a knowledge leader indicates “how to go”. Synchronization or group
agreement can still be achieved in such a network with only local interactions.

Consider a coupled network containing n elements without a power leader

˙xi = f (xi, ai, t) +

Kji(xj − xi)

i = 1, . . . , n

Xj∈Ni

where the connectivity can be general. Assume now that the uncoupled dynamics f (xi, ai, t) contains
a parameter set ai which has a ﬁxed value a for all the knowledge leaders. Denote Ω as the set of
the followers, whose adaptation laws are based on local interactions

with estimation error ˜ai = ai − a .

Note that for condition (5) to be true, we need a connected network, an upper bounded λmax(KΛ)ijs,
and strong enough coupling strengths. For an example, if m = 1 and all the coupling gains are
identical with value κ, condition (5) turns to be

Theorem 2 For a knowledge-based leader-followers network, the states of all the elements will con-
verge together asymptotically if condition (5) is veriﬁed and all the states are bounded. Furthermore,
∀ i ∈ Ω, ai will converge to a if

∃ α > 0, T > 0, ∀t ≥ 0

Proof: Condition (5) means V is non-increasing. Assuming all the functions are smoothly diﬀeren-
tiable, the boundedness of ¨V can be concluded if all the states are bounded. According to Barbalat’s

under condition (6).

Theorem 2 implies that new elements can be added into the network without prior knowledge
of the individual dynamics, and that elements in an existing network have the ability to recover
dynamic information if temporarily lost. Similar knowledge-based leader-followers mechanism may
exist in many natural processes. In evolutionary biology, knowledge leaders are essential to keep the
evolution processes uninvasible or evolutionary stable [16, 18]. In reproduction, for instance, the
leaders could be senior members. The knowledge-based mechanism may also describe evolutionary
mutation or disease infection [12], where the leaders are mutants or invaders. Knowledge-based
leader-following may also occur in animal aggregate motions or human social activities. In a bird
ﬂock, for instance, the knowledge leader can be a junior or injured member whose moving capacity
is limited, and which is protected by others through dynamic adaptation.

Note that the adaptive model we described represents a genotype-phenotype mapping, where
adaptation occurring in genotypic space is based on the interactions of behavioral phenotypes.
Due to its complexity, genotype-phenotype mapping remains a big challenge today in evolutionary
biology [16].

Example 3.1 : Consider six FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons [4, 14, 15], a famous spiking neuron model,
connected as in Figure 1(b)

˙vi = vi(αi − vi)(vi − 1) − wi + Ii +

kij(vj − vi)

˙wi = βivi − γiwi

i = 1, . . . , 6

Assume that the parameter set ai = [αi, Ii, γi, βi]T is ﬁxed to the only knowledge leader, and those of
the others change according to the adaptation law (3). Simulation results are plotted in Figure 2. ✷

Additional Remarks:

• Leaders holding diﬀerent knowledges are allowed to exist in the same network, just like a
human society may contain experts in diﬀerent ﬁelds. As an example, consider (2) again. Assume

States and parameters will converge under the same conditions as those given in Theorem 2.

• To improve the convergence rate, the adaptation law (3) may be reﬁned as

ˆai = ai + QiWT (xi, t)

Kji (xj − xi)

Xj∈Ni

where Qi > 0 is constant and symmetric, and ai is deﬁned by (3). Note that in the theoretical

• The number of leaders in a knowledge-based network can be arbitrary. At the limit all el-
ements could be adaptive, i.e., there is no leader at all, in which case they may converge to any
odd parameter set depending on initial conditions. While all states will still converge together, the
desired individual behaviors (such as oscillations) may not be preserved.

• Synchronization conditions derived in Theorem 2 are very similar to those in [22, 25] for cou-
pled networks without any leader or adaptation. Note that if the condition (5) is true, ∀ neighbored
i, j, xi − xj are bounded. Thus the boundedness of the states are simply determined by the Input-
to-State Stability [8] of the system ˙y = f (y, a, t) + u where the input u is bounded.

• The condition (6) is true if the stable system behaviors are suﬃciently rich or persistently
exciting. This is the case, for instance, when the individual elements are oscillators, where the pos-
sibilities that any component of xi converges to zero can be excluded by dynamic analysis showing
that zero is an unstable state.

• Both power leaders and knowledge leaders could be virtual, which is common in animal ag-
gregate motions. For instance, a landmark may be used as a virtual power leader. Similarly, when
hunting, an escaping prey could specify both the where and the how of the movement.

4 Paciﬁc Coexistence

Diﬀerent types of leaders can co-exist in the same network. A power leader could be also a knowledge
leader, or conversely, as we illustrated in Figure 1(c), a power leader guiding the direction may use
state measurements from its neighbors to adapt its parameters to the values of the knowledge
leaders.

Consider the power-based leader-followers network (1) again, assuming the dynamics f contains
a parameter set a. There are knowledge leaders holding the ﬁxed value a and knowledge followers
using adaptation to learn. If 0 ∈ Ω, the set of the knowledge followers, we have

˙a0 = P0WT (x0, t)

γi K0i (xi − x0)

while if i ∈ Ω with i = 1, . . . , n,

To prove state convergence, ﬁrst we deﬁne several Laplacian matrices for a power-based network

Following the same proofs as those in Sections 3, this then implies that all the states xi, i = 0, 1, . . . , n
will converge together asymptotically. Parameter convergence conditions are also the same.

5 Concluding Remarks

We studied two types of leaders for networked systems, which spread desired orientation or dynamics
through distributed interactions. Synchronization conditions were derived, as well as the parameter
convergence conditions for knowledge-based leader-followers networks.

For notational simplicity, we show the derivations for the case m = 1.

6.1 Proof of Lemma 1

Notice that 0 is always one of the eigenvalues of LKΛ − L2
v = [1, 1, . . . , 1]T . According to Weyl’s Theorem [6],

K, with one corresponding eigenvector

λn−k+1(LKΛ − L2

K) ≤ λn(LKΛ) − λk(L2

K)

7

where k = 1, 2, . . . , n, and the eigenvalues λi are arranged in increasing order for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
This implies that, ∀k > 1, λn−k+1(LKΛ − L2
K) < 0 if

λn(LKΛ) < λ2(L2

(7)

Therefore, λn(LKΛ − L2

K) = 0, i.e., LKΛ − L2

K is negative semi-deﬁnite.

and (5) are always true; if ¯λ > 0,

x =

Since the eigenvalue λi < 0 ∀i < n, xT ( LKΛ − L2
x1 = x2 = · · · = xn.

K ) x = 0 if and only if x = knvn, that is,

In case m > 1, we can follow the same proof except that zero eigenvalue here has m multiplicity,
and the corresponding eigenvectors {v1, v2, . . . , vm} are linear combinations of the orthogonal set
[I, I, . . . , I]T where I ∈ Rm×m is identity matrix.

6.2 Network with Both Leaders

Similarly to the proof in 6.1, ¯LKΛ − ~LT

K ~LK is negative semi-deﬁnite if

and its only eigendirection for the zero eigenvalue is thus v = [1, 1, . . . , 1]T . Since

λn+1(¯LKΛ) < λ2(~LT

K ~LK) ≥ λ1(C2) = λ2

we have

according to the Interlacing Eigenvalues Theorem for bordered matrices [6]. Thus a suﬃcient
condition to guarantee negative semi-deﬁnite is

1(C) > λn+1(¯LKΛ)
λ2

This condition is similar to the one we derived in Theorem 1 for synchronization of pure power-
based leader-followers network. Assuming all the coupling strengths are identical with value κ,
condition (8) becomes

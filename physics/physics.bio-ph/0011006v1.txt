Abstract

We demonstrate an application of spherical harmonic decomposition to anal-
ysis of the human electroencephalogram (EEG). We implement two methods
and discuss issues speciﬁc to analysis of hemispherical, irregularly sampled
data. Performance of the methods and spatial sampling requirements are
quantiﬁed using simulated data. The analysis is applied to experimental EEG
data, conﬁrming earlier reports of an approximate frequency-wavenumber re-
lationship in some bands.

I. INTRODUCTION

The human electroencephalogram (EEG), as measured at the scalp, represents a super-
position of electric ﬁelds resulting from post-synaptic potentials in neocortex, the thin (2 to
5 mm) surface layer of human brains. Several models of neocortical dynamics treat EEG as
a mixed global/local phenomenon [1–3], and a better understanding of its spatial-temporal
dynamics is necessary for evaluation and reﬁnement of these models. Its temporal behavior
has been studied at length, both by clinical observation [4] and with such tools as power
spectra [5], coherence [6], the Hilbert transform [7], and many others. However, until re-
cently poor spatial resolution (due to minimal electrode sampling and under-use of head
models) has limited spatial analysis of EEG [1,2,8].

As a potential ﬁeld on a near-hemispherical surface, EEG is amenable to analysis by
spherical harmonic decomposition. In this paper, we apply two methods of decomposition
(one described by Cadusch [9] and one adapted from Misner [10]) to 131-channel EEG data.
Using simulated data, we discuss issues and pitfalls relevant to such an analysis, speciﬁcally
the eﬀects of limited and irregular sampling density, integration over a hemisphere, and
deviations from a spherical surface. From the experimental data, we then draw conclusions
regarding the frequency-wavenumber relation of neocortical activity.

We use the real spherical harmonics [11], deﬁned on the sphere Ω and described by the

hYlm|Yl′m′i =

Ylm(θ, φ)Yl′m′(θ, φ) sin θdθdφ = δl,l′ δm,m′.

(1)

In theory, a potential ﬁeld Φ(Ω) may be decomposed into spherical harmonic amplitudes
Φlm deﬁned by

Φlm = ZΩ

Ylm(θ, φ)Φ(θ, φ)d2Ω.

(2)

In the example of EEG and similar data we encounter three major and two minor issues.

A. Sampling

First, when attempting to decompose experimental data, we sample Φ(Ω) at speciﬁc
locations Γ. Assuming near-regularly spaced electrodes, our maximum resolvable l is deter-
mined by a spherical analog of the familiar Nyquist limit [12] fmax = 1/(2∆T ). With mean
angular inter-electrode distance γ, we initially adopt a conservative limit of

lmax = " π

2γ# ,

(3)

or lmax = 6 for our 131-channel electrode cap. Analog pre-ﬁltering to avoid spatial aliasing
is not required here due to the low-pass characteristics of the head volume conductor [13].

2

B. Regularization

With sampled data F (Γ), the discretized version of the decomposition in Eq. 2 is unstable
in higher l-indices. (An apparently accurate reconstruction of the signal may be generated,
with large artifacts in the higher spatial frequencies.) We must invoke constraint or regular-
ization techniques to address this issue. Cadusch et al [9] approached the problem as a side
issue of spherical spline interpolation. The estimate ˆΦlm is constrained by the spline con-
straints, and the problem for a given sampling grid and lmax is reduced to a multiplication
by a matrix of µlm coeﬃcients:

ˆΦlm = Xx∈Γ

µlm(x)F (x).

(4)

Recently, Misner [10] introduced a more complex method for decomposition on a rect-
angular three-dimensional grid; that is, generalized to use Ynlm(r, θ, φ). We implement here
the special case of sampling on a spherical surface, more relevant to EEG analysis, in which
r is constant. In Misner’s method, a correction matrix of GAB accounts for discretization
and limited sampling:

GAB = Xx∈Γ

YA(x)YB(x)wx,

(5)

where A and B refer to index groups (lm). Here we use the real harmonics and replace
Misner’s weight function wx with the eﬀective area of each electrode. GAB, the matrix
inverse of the GAB, is used to calculate “adjoint spherical harmonics” Y A. Finally, a set of
coeﬃcients Rlm, analogous to Cadusch’ µlm, is generated and used as in Eq. 4 to estimate
ˆΦlm.

C. Hemispherical sampling

Particularly relevant to EEG analysis is the error introduced by sampling over only half
of the sphere. This sampling corresponds to only 1
2 of a spatial cycle of the l = 1, m = 0
function, suggesting potential accuracy problems for functions involving l = 0 and 1. It is
also clear that the functions Ylm will no longer be orthonormal for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 only; rather,
we replace the δ in Eq. 1 with an error quantity ǫ:

hYA|YBi =

2π

Z0

π

2

Z0

YA (θ, φ) YB (θ, φ) sin θdθdφ = ǫAB.

(6)

In general, our hemispherical estimates ˆΦ′
result by the matrix of ǫAB’s:

A will be related to the hypothetical full-sphere

ˆΦ′ = ǫ ˆΦ

(7)

and our ˆΦ′
A become somewhat ambiguous between certain sets of (l, m). Although it
may seem appropriate to invert ǫ and calculate a more accurate result, the matrix is ill-
conditioned (R > 108, where the 2-norm condition number R is the ratio of the largest
singular value of ǫ to the smallest) and thus the inversion is problematic.

3

In addition, if we use the hemispherical region to calculate Misner’s GAB in Eq. 5, the
resulting matrix of GAB is ill-conditioned (R > 108) and thus the GAB cannot be reliably
found. Rather, we created a mirrored set of electrodes Γ′, calculated the matrix R of Rlm
for sample set (Γ ∪ Γ′), and discarded the antipodal rows of R. Cadusch’ spline method,
while still subject to Eq. 7, is native to the hemispherical surface and requires no further
manipulation.

D. Coordinate orientation

In many problems, the sphere has no preferred direction. The m-indices are usually col-
lapsed [14] to produce an angular power spectrum estimate ˆG (l) as a function of wavenumber
l:

ˆG(l) =

l

Xm=−l(cid:16) ˆΦ′

lm(cid:17)2

(8)

which is independent of coordinate system orientation. As well, we found the “hemispherical
error” in l-spectrum to be independent of orientation. In some EEG studies, of course, the
orientation of the underlying cerebral hemispheres may be relevant.
In such cases, local
spatial Fourier analysis [1] should adequately complement our decomposition without the
complication of distinguishing m-modes.

E. Non-spherical media

We assume that our medium Ω is a sphere, whereas biological data is often sampled on an
irregular surface. The upper surface of the “average” human head [15] may be represented
as a hemiellipsoid with axes a = 10.52 cm, b = 7.66 cm, and c = 8.41 cm, or alternatively
25%, -9%, and 0% elongation from a perfect sphere. Although prolate spheroidal harmonics
have been applied to biophysical ﬁeld problems [16–18], the technique is often unwieldy. In
comparison to error from ǫAB, especially for low l, we assume the error due to approximating
the ellipsoidal surface with a spherical surface is negligible.

III. APPLICATION TO SIMULATED DATA

We generated evenly tessellated, hemispherical electrode maps of 74, 187, 282, and 559
electrodes, in addition to common experimental maps of 20, 64, and 131 [8] electrodes. Five
hundred potential maps were simulated for each electrode conﬁguration. Each potential
map was randomly generated with harmonics of degree l = 6, such that the Φlm varied with
uniform distribution between 0 and 1. Power spectrum estimates ˆG (l) were then calculated
for each map, using both methods. Figure 1 shows Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients rl,
calculated between G (l) and ˆG (l) over the 500 trials for each electrode map.

We have noted that the error due to ǫAB causes power from one (l, m)-component to be
misinterpreted as power in another, often of diﬀerent l. Therefore, we might expect either
method’s performance to depend on the l-spectrum being analyzed. Using preliminary

4

experimental data, we constructed an approximate power spectrum Gnorm(l) for average-
referenced scalp EEG, peaked at l = 1 and l = 2, and decaying with l−1 thereafter. Another
ﬁve hundred potential maps were generated, with Φlm uniformly distributed between

0 < Φlm <

Gnorm(l)

2l + 1

(9)

to simulate a physiologically realistic distribution of l-spectra. Power spectrum estimates
ˆG (l) were calculated for each map using both methods. Results are shown in Fig. 2.

In general, results for the spline method — though often quite accurate — were dependent
on the distribution of l-spectra being measured, exact electrode positions, and electrode
numbers. Results for the adjoint harmonic method seemed more robust, even for sparse
(n = 64) sampling, although accuracy was somewhat less in the higher harmonics.

In both methods, for l = 6 we observed minimal improvement for more than 131 elec-
trodes. We thus believe that our 131-channel sampling is an appropriate tool for further
study. Furthermore, given the limit in Eq. 3 and the known volume-conductor attenuation
of higher modes [13], we suggest that study of spatial frequencies higher than approximately
l = 8 will be better served by intracranial EEG than by denser electrode maps.

In general, for low l the adjoint harmonic method seemed more consistent. We examined
typical 131-channel decompositions (Fig. 3) to investigate further. Both methods accurately
reproduced the potential maps (r > 0.9 for 131 channels). The spline method, however,
was slightly unstable for low l, and the erroneous negative ˆΦlm are reﬂected in the power
spectrum.

IV. REFINEMENTS AND ANALYSIS OF ERROR

Any application of the spherical harmonic decomposition should take into account the
estimated relative contribution of various error sources. Aside from measurement and ex-
perimental error, these may be divided into three categories: sampling error, orientation
error, and hemispherical error.

A. Sampling error

Figures 1 and 2 indicate minimal improvement for l ≤ 6 with more than 131 electrodes.
We can thus deduce that the Nyquist-like limit in Eq. 3 is an appropriate guideline. When
using coarser sampling, we expect some decrease in performance for higher l. Decreased
accuracy for 20, 64, and 74 channels (seen in Figs. 1 and 2, particularly for 20 channels)
may be attributed to sampling error.

B. Orientation error

For a given l-spectrum, results will vary if power is randomly distributed across the m’s;
that is, various m-components interact diﬀerently with our hemispherical sample grid. Five

5

hundred random l-spectra, with realistic distribution of G(l), were generated. Thirty 131-
channel maps, randomly varying in m-power, were generated for each original l-spectrum.
Figure 4 displays the resulting accuracy, again shown as correlation coeﬃcient rl between
G(l) and ˆG (l) over the 100 trials.

Very little is gained in this simulation by decomposition of multiple epochs. As de-
scribed in the following section, error due to m-distribution of power is largely swamped
by hemispherical error. In practice, however, we must emphasize (in the presence of ran-
dom measurement noise) the importance of averaging decompositions across many epochs.
Orientation error will also become signiﬁcant if our sampling grid is severely non-uniform.

C. Hemispherical error

In Sec. II above, we have discussed the hemispherical error ǫAB. Although it is impos-
sible to improve our decomposition results by inverting the matrix ǫ, we may generate a
corresponding matrix for the power spectrum result and use it to estimate the contribution
of hemispherical error.

Power in a single harmonic Ylm(θ, φ) is blurred by the hemispherical decomposition into
surrounding harmonics. Using the 131-channel sampling map, we generated ﬁve hundred
potential maps for each of l = 0 . . . 6, each with one unit power distributed randomly among
the available m’s. By averaging over the ﬁve hundred resulting power spectra, for each l,
we obtained an empirical “averaged blurring matrix” E for power spectra obtained from
hemispherical decomposition. That is,

ˆG(l) ≈ EG(l).

(10)

The typical E for both methods is a blurred identity matrix; that is, error in power spectra
is largely between adjacent l. It is again tempting to invert E, de-blur our spectra, and cal-
culate a more accurate result, but although most E are invertable we found that for realistic
spectra the beneﬁt was marginal at best. Instead, E may be used to better understand the
implications of hemispherical error.

We calculated correlation coeﬃcients as in Fig. 4, between EG(l) and ˆG (l) over the
500 trials of 30 epochs for 131 electrodes. The resulting higher correlations (although not
applicable to a decomposition of real data) are plotted in Fig. 5. By comparison with Figs.
2a and 4, the result indicates the importance of hemispherical error. In particular, after
examination of typical E and ǫ matrices, we may interpret the decreased performance at
low l as blurring between adjacent wavenumbers. Furthermore, the increased eﬀect, seen
in Fig. 5, of averaging across various m-distributions indicates that some abrupt changes
in performance may be attributed to sensitive interactions between E-blurring and random
m-distribution.

Practically, the near-identity character of E is extremely useful. Hemispherical error
manifests as blurring between adjacent l. Thus, we may expect composite measures such
as the sum of power in l=0,1 to be substantially more accurate than individual estimates.

sampling densities.

V. APPLICATION TO EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Nunez in 1974 [19,20] and Shaw in 1991 [21], using Fourier analysis along linear electrode
EEG arrays, observed a relationship between increasing spatial and increasing temporal
frequency in the 8-13 Hz band, roughly consistent with simple wave dispersion relations.
We attempted to duplicate this result in order to test the adjoint harmonic method under
experimental conditions. We analyzed 131-channel EEG (resting, eyes closed) in ﬁve human
subjects. Temporal Fourier coeﬃcients were determined for 300 to 600 one-second epochs
(depending on available data), and l-spectra averaged over these epochs.

Results are summarized in Fig. 7 as the ratio of power in low (l = 0, 1) to power in high
(l = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) spatial frequencies. Above approximately f = 8 Hz, with increasing f we
observed a general trend towards power in higher l. We also observed high-wavenumber
power in the delta band (f ≤ 3 Hz). The alpha band (c. 8–13 Hz) was characterized by the
highest power in low spatial frequencies.

In order to rule out methodological artifact, we generated and analyzed 300 seconds of
simulated EEG using 3602 uncorrelated sources, each generating 1/f noise through a head
volume conductor model as described in [13]. As expected, the EEG-like noise (labeled RND
in the ﬁgure) showed no relation between spatial and temporal frequencies.

VI. CONFIDENCE INTERVAL ESTIMATION

Estimates of the temporal power spectrum are known to vary in chi-square distribution
[12], assuming normally distributed estimates of the underlying Fourier coeﬃcients. Error
distribution for spatial spectrum estimates, on the other hand, is complicated by the de-
pendence of hemispherical and orientation error on the entire l-spectrum. For composite
measures of both spatial and temporal spectra, such as shown in Fig. 7, the situation be-
comes even more problematic. We propose an empirical test for estimation of such conﬁdence
levels, analogous to the randomization tests commonly applied in nonparametric statistical
analysis [22].

Let

A =

G01
G2...6

,

(11)

where G01 is the total power in harmonics l=0 and l=1, and G2...6 is the total power in
harmonics l=2 through l=6. Let ˆG01, ˆG2...6, and ˆA represent estimates of the same. Above,
we calculated ˆAf for various temporal frequencies. Here, we calculate an approximate 95%
conﬁdence interval for single-epoch estimates of the actual Af . The conﬁdence interval will
apply only to the spatial spectrum composite measure, neglecting error (or nonstationarity)
in temporal frequency spectra, which for many applications may be as important. Note,
though, that for 300 epochs the normalized standard error of a temporal power spectrum
estimate is less than 6%.

To determine an empirical conﬁdence interval, we would typically examine the distri-
bution of random re-samples. In this application, we created many random l-spectra from
an estimated distribution of l-power, simulated many decompositions, and examined the
resulting distribution as follows.

7

Since hemispherical error is dependent on l-spectrum, the result will be inﬂuenced by
the distribution of the random spectra. Srinivasan et al
[13] analytically estimated the
spatial frequency domain transfer function for volume-conduction blurring of scalp potential
as proportional to (2l+1)−1. This “spatial smearing” is due mainly to the poorly conducting
skull and physical separation between cortical current sources and scalp electrodes. In our
calculation, we assumed that underlying l-spectra vary in uniform distribution in proportion
to (2l + 1)−1, and that with average-referenced data the contribution of l=0 is negligible. A
large number (20,000) of l-spectra were generated, randomly selecting for each l-bin a value
from the appropriate distribution. The decomposition was performed, and the composite
measure A calculated, for each randomized spectrum.

By examining the distribution of known surrogate Arand which produce a certain estimate
ˆArand , we can estimate an empirical conﬁdence interval for our spectral estimate. In Fig. 8,
we show the scatter plot of Arand against ˆArand with 95% conﬁdence intervals. For a given
estimate ˆA and the assumptions discussed above, 95% of the time, the actual A will fall
between the two lines shown.

A similar procedure may be used to calculate conﬁdence intervals for other measures,
whether the actual Gl or other composite measures. Careful judgment must be applied
when estimating conﬁdence intervals for multiple-epoch measures such as shown in Fig. 6.
As demonstrated earlier in this paper, variation in the m-component of an l, m-spectrum
only allows us to “average out” the minimal orientation error. Variation in hemispherical
error (dependent on l-spectrum), without gross violation of the stationarity assumption, is
necessary for the average of estimates ˆA over multiple epochs to converge to A.

VII. DISCUSSION

Our simulations provide a ﬁrm basis for application of spherical harmonic decomposition
to irregularly sampled, hemispherical data such as EEG. Our hemispherical modiﬁcation
of Misner’s adjoint harmonic method [10] proved most consistent. However, for physiologi-
cal data of known power distribution, the spline method [9] is complementary and may be
slightly more accurate with high-density sampling. It seems that, within the conservative
band-limit of equation [3] and the known spatial ﬁlter properties of the head [13], decom-
position accuracy will not be materially improved by more than 131 electrodes for scalp
EEG. We suggest that conﬁdence intervals for such decompositions, or for decomposition-
derived measures, be determined empirically using randomized data. Furthermore, while
single-decomposition errors are relatively large, with multiple epochs the experimental ac-
curacy may be increased substantially. For this averaging to be both valid and eﬀective, we
must assume a quasi-stationary wavenumber spectrum across our epochs, but with suﬃcient
random variation in hemispherical error for our estimates to converge upon the mean. In
addition, especially in EEG applications, we must remain aware of the limitations inherent
in collapse across m’s (we assume the orientation of the underlying cerebral hemispheres is
irrelevant) and the use of spherical harmonics on a hemispheroidal surface.

The dynamical properties of human EEG rhythms are quite complicated, varying sub-
stantially between individuals and brain states. Furthermore, physiologically-based theo-
retical models point to substantial nonlinear eﬀects and interactions across spatial scales

8

[2,23–26]. Despite all the obvious complications, results from the spherical harmonic de-
composition of experimental EEG agreed qualitatively with crude linear electrode array
results [1,21]. These results were seen in all subjects and are consistent with a mixed
global/local model of cortical dynamics, in which lower global mode oscillations produce
alpha rhythm, superimposed on local (spatially uncorrelated) activity in various frequency
bands [2]. Further study of spatiotemporal EEG dynamics, using spherical harmonic de-
composition, should shed more light on these issues.

FIG. 1. Correlations between actual and estimated l-power for uniformly distributed random
spectra. Five hundred potential maps were generated from known wavenumber spectra, with
random power in each l-component, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. For each of seven
electrode densities, wavenumber spectra were estimated by spherical harmonic decomposition of
the 500 sampled maps. Correlations between actual power and estimated power were calculated
over the 500 trials for each l-component. Shown here for (a) adjoint harmonic and (b) spline
methods, these correlations are a measure of the quality of a single decomposed power spectrum.

FIG. 2. Correlations between actual and estimated l-power for more realistically distributed
random spectra based on genuine EEG data. As in Fig. 1, but in original spectra random power
in each l-component is uniformly distributed between 0 and (2l + 1)−1.

FIG. 3. Topography (left column), l, m-spectra (center column), and l-power (right column)
for a typical 131-channel spherical harmonic decomposition. The original map is shown in (a). The
adjoint harmonic method (b) reconstructs topography and gives an approximation of l-spectrum.
Although the spline method (c) also reconstructs potential topography, we observe irregularities in
the lower l amplitude estimates that contribute to decreased performance for these wavenumbers,
and a less accurate l-spectrum estimate.

FIG. 4. Correlations between actual and estimated l-power

for multiple-epoch, ad-
joint-harmonic estimates of the same l-spectrum, with epochs varying only in m-component. For
a reasonably isotropic and dense sample array, such as the 131-channel EEG grid used here, there
is little orientation error and thus little improvement in results.

FIG. 5. Sampling a full sphere with 262 channels and the adjoint harmonic method, correlations
between actual and estimated l-power are shown for multiple-epoch (varying only in m-component)
estimates of the same l-spectrum. By sampling over the full sphere, we eliminate hemispherical
errors illustrated in Fig. 4. Remaining errors are due to orientation (note improvement with
multiple epochs) and imperfect sampling.

FIG. 6. Correlation coeﬃcients, using the adjoint harmonic method, obtained by comparisons
of estimated to actual summed power measures. The solid line represents power in l=0 and l=1
modes, and the broken line represents power summed over modes l=2 through l=6.
Increased
accuracy (as compared to part A of Fig. 2) is because most hemispherical error manifests as
blurring between power in adjacent l’s.

FIG. 7. Five to ten minutes of resting, eyes-closed EEG were collected with 131 channels from
each of six subjects (one duplicated). Complex temporal Fourier coeﬃcients were calculated for
one-second epochs and subjected to spherical harmonic spatial decomposition using the adjoint
harmonic method. Resulting wavenumber spectra were averaged for each 1-Hz band over the 300
to 600 epochs. The ratio of power in l=0,1 to l=2,3,4,5,6 is plotted as a simple indicator of a bias
toward higher spatial frequencies at higher temporal frequencies (greater than about 10 Hz). This
result is qualitatively consistent with the postulated existence of an approximate EEG dispersion
relation, perhaps with alpha rhythm (8–13 Hz) representing the fundamental and lower overtones.
A surrogate signal (dotted line), composed of random EEG-like noise and subjected to the same
analysis, showed no such relation.

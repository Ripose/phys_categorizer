Abstract

We investigate the competition between two quasis-
pecies residing on two disparate neutral networks.
Under the assumption that the two neutral networks
have diﬀerent topologies and ﬁtness levels, it is the
mutation rate that determines which quasispecies will
eventually be driven to extinction. For small muta-
tion rates, we ﬁnd that the quasispecies residing on
the neutral network with the lower replication rate
will disappear. For higher mutation rates, however,
the faster replicating sequences may be outcompeted
by the slower replicating ones in case the connec-
tion density on the second neutral network is suﬃ-
ciently high. Our analytical results are in excellent
agreement with ﬂow-reactor simulations of replicat-
ing RNA sequences.

At high mutation rates, the number of mutated
oﬀspring generated in a population far exceeds the
number of oﬀspring identical to their parents. As a
result, a stable cloud of mutants, a so-called qua-
sispecies (Eigen and Schuster 1979; Eigen et al.
1988; Eigen et al. 1989; Nowak 1992; Wilke et al.
2001),
forms around the fastest replicating geno-
types. Experimental evidence in favor of such a
persistent cloud of mutants is available from RNA
viruses (Steinhauer et al. 1989; Domingo and Hol-
land 1997; Burch and Chao 2000) and in vitro RNA

replication (Biebricher 1987; Biebricher and Gardiner
1997); both are cases in which a high substitution
rate per nucleotide is common (Drake 1993). The ex-
istence of a quasispecies has important implications
for the way in which selection acts, because the evo-
lutionary success of individual sequences depends on
the overall growth rate of the quasispecies they be-
long to. As a consequence, organisms with a high
replication rate that produce a large number of oﬀ-
spring with poor ﬁtness can be outcompeted by or-
ganisms of smaller ﬁtness that produce a larger num-
ber of also-ﬁt oﬀspring (Schuster and Swetina 1988).
Similarly, if a percentage of the possible mutations
is neutral, and the majority of the non-neutral mu-
tations is strongly deleterious, then the growth rate
of a quasispecies depends signiﬁcantly on the con-
nection density (the number of nearby neutral mu-
tants of an average viable genotype) of the neutral
genotypes (van Nimwegen et al. 1999). Therefore,
a neutral network (a set of closely related mutants
with identical ﬁtness) with high connectivity can be
advantageous over one with higher ﬁtness, but lower
connectivity. Here, we are interested in this latter
possibility. In particular, we investigate the compe-
tition of two quasispecies residing on separate neu-
tral networks with diﬀerent connection densities and
replication rates, and determine under what condi-
tions selection favors the more ﬁt (i.e., of higher repli-
cation rate) or the more robust (more densely con-
nected) mutant cloud. Our approach is closely re-
lated to the study of holey landscapes, in which all
genotypes are classiﬁed into either viable or inviable
ones (Gavrilets and Gravner 1997; Gavrilets 1997).

However, we extend this picture by further subdivid-
ing the viable genotypes into two groups with diﬀer-
ent replication rates.

The paper is organized as follows. First, we de-
scribe a simple model of a quasispecies on a single
neutral network, and demonstrate that the model is
consistent with simulations of RNA sequences. Then,
based on this model, we present a model of two com-
peting quasispecies, and compare the second model
with simulation results as well. Following that, we
study the probability of ﬁxation of a single advan-
tageous mutant that arises in a fully formed quasis-
pecies. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
results and give conclusions.

Population Dynamics on a Single Neutral
Network

Before we can address the competition of two qua-
sispecies, we need a good description of a single qua-
sispecies on a neutral network. A fundamental contri-
bution to this problem has been made by van Nimwe-
gen et al. (1999), who showed that the average ﬁtness
of a population on a neutral network is determined
only by the ﬁtness of the neutral genotypes, the mu-
tation rate, and the largest eigenvalue of the neu-
tral genotypes’ connection matrix. The connection
matrix is a symmetric matrix with one row/column
per neutral genotype. It holds a one in those posi-
tions where the row- and the column-genotype are
exactly one point-mutation apart, and a zero oth-
erwise.
In theory, the formalism of van Nimwegen
et al. describes a population on a neutral network
well. However, the exact connection matrix is nor-
mally not known, which implies that we cannot cal-
culate the population dynamics from ﬁrst principles.
Nevertheless, we can base a very simple model on
the fact – also established by van Nimwegen et al.–
that the average neutrality in the population, which
is exactly the largest eigenvalue of the connection ma-
trix, is independent of the mutation rate. The main
assumption of our simple model is that the popu-
lation behaves as if all sequences in the population
had the same neutrality ν, where ν is given by the
average neutrality in the population. Moreover, we
consider genetic sequences of length l, and assume a
per-symbol copy ﬁdelity of q. Then, the eﬀective copy
ﬁdelity or neutral ﬁdelity (Ofria and Adami 2001) Q,
i.e., the probability with which on average a viable

sequence gives birth to oﬀspring that also resides on
the neutral network, is given by

Q = [1 − (1 − q)(1 − ν)]l
−l(1−q)(1−ν) .

≈ e

Now, we can devise a two-concentration model in
which x1(t) is the total concentration of all sequences
on the neutral network, and xd(t) is the concentra-
tion of sequences oﬀ the network (these sequences are
assumed to replicate so slowly that their oﬀspring can
be neglected). The two quantities satisfy the equa-
tions

˙x1(t) = w1Qx1(t) − e(t)x1(t) ,
˙xd(t) = w1(1 − Q)x1(t) − e(t)xd(t) ,

(2a)

where w1 is the ﬁtness of the sequences on the neutral
network, and e(t) is the excess production (or mean
ﬁtness in the population) e(t) = w1x1(t). Equa-
tion (2a) can be integrated directly. We ﬁnd

x1(t) =

Qx1(0)
x1(0) + [Q − x1(0)]e−w1Qt .

(3)

In the steady state (t → ∞), this implies that the
concentration of sequences on the network is equal
to the eﬀective ﬁdelity Q,

x1 = Q = e

−l(1−q)(1−ν) .

(4)

Therefore, by measuring the decay of the concentra-
tion of sequences on the neutral network as a function
of the copy ﬁdelity q, we can estimate the population
neutrality ν.

Note that the above description of the evolving
population is similar to the one presented by Reidys
et al. (2001), with one important conceptual diﬀer-
ence. The article by Reidys et al. (2001) was com-
pleted before van Nimwegen et al.’s work was avail-
able, and therefore it was not clear what their ef-
fective ﬁdelity did actually relate to. Here, on the
other hand, we know that Q depends only on the
copy ﬁdelity per nucleotide, q, and the average pop-
ulation neutrality ν, which is independent of q and
could be calculated exactly if the connection matrix
of the neutral genotypes was known.

We have measured the average equilibrium con-
centration x1 of sequences on the network for RNA

secondary structure folding. RNA folding is a reli-
able test case, and has been applied to a wide array
of diﬀerent questions related to the dynamics of evo-
lution (Fontana et al. 1993; Huynen et al. 1996;
Fontana and Schuster 1998; Schuster and Fontana
1999; Ancel and Fontana 2000; Reidys et al. 2001).
We simulated a ﬂow reactor using the Gillespie al-
gorithm (Gillespie 1976), and performed the RNA
folding with the Vienna package (Hofacker et al.
1994), version 1.3.1, which uses the parameters given
by Walter et al. (1994). The carrying capacity was
set to N = 1000 sequences, and the reactor was ini-
tially ﬁlled with 1000 identical copies of a sequence
that folded into a given target structure. Sequences
folding into the target structure were replicating with
rate one per unit time, and all other sequences with
rate 10−6 per unit time. We let the reactor equili-
brate for 50 time steps, and then measured the aver-
age concentration of correctly folding sequences over
the next 150 time steps.

Results for the two diﬀerent target structures de-
picted in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2. In both cases,
we see a very clear exponential decay. Up to a muta-
tion rate of 0.05, which is quite high for the sequences
of length l = 62 we are considering here, we cannot
make out a signiﬁcant deviation from a straight line
in the log-linear plot. This veriﬁes the applicability of
our simple model to evolving RNA sequences. Note
that our simulations also show a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in the eﬀective neutrality of the two structures, which
will be of importance in the next section.

Two Competing Quasispecies

Analytical Model

Above, we have established a simple description
for a quasispecies residing on a single neutral net-
work. In a similar fashion, we can treat the compe-
tition of two quasispecies residing on separate net-
works. We classify all sequences into three diﬀerent
groups: sequences on network one, sequences on net-
work two, and dead sequences (sequences that repli-
cate much slower than sequences on either of the two
networks, or do not replicate at all). We denote the
respective relative concentrations by x1, x2, and xd.
We make the further assumption that all sequences
within a neutral network i have the same probabil-
ity Qi to mutate into another sequence on network

i, and we neglect mutations from one network to the
other. The probability to fall oﬀ of a network i is
hence 1 − Qi. The diﬀerential equations for an inﬁ-
nite population are then:
˙x1(t) = w1Q1x1(t) − e(t)x1(t) ,
˙x2(t) = w2Q2x2(t) − e(t)x2(t) ,
˙xd(t) = w1(1 − Q1)x1(t) + w2(1 − Q2)x2(t) − e(t)xd(t) ,

(5b)

(5a)

where w1 and w2 are the ﬁtnesses of sequences on
network one or two, respectively, and e(t) is the ex-
cess production e(t) = w1x1(t) + w2x2(t). In order to
solve Eq. (5), it is useful to introduce the matrix

W = 


w1Q1
0

0

0
w1(1 − Q1) w2(1 − Q2) 0


0
w2Q2

.

(6)

We further need the exponential of W, which is given
by

exp(Wt) = 


ew1Q1t
0
1−Q1
Q1 (ew1Q1t − 1)

0
ew2Q2t

0
0
1−Q2
Q2 (ew2Q2t − 1) 1
(7)





Now, if we combine the concentrations x1, x2, xd into
a vector x = (x1, x2, xd)t, we ﬁnd

x(t) = exp(Wt) · x(t)/[ˆe · exp(Wt) · x(0)]

(8)
with ˆe := (1, 1, 1). The denominator on the right-
hand side of Eq. (8) corresponds to the cumulative
t
0 e(t) dt, which is given
excess production ecum(t) =
by

R

ecum(t) = ˆe · exp(Wt) · x(0)

Q2

+

=

(ew1Q1t + Q1 − 1)

(ew2Q2t + Q2 − 1) + xd(0) .

(9)

The solution to Eq. (5) follows now as

x1(t) =

x2(t) =

xd(t) =

(10a)

x2(0) ,

x1(0) ,

Q1Q2ecum(t) h(ew1Q1t − 1)(1 − Q1)Q2x1(0)
+ (ew2Q2t − 1)(1 − Q2)Q1x2(0) + Q1Q2xd(0)i .

(10b)

(10c)

There exist two possible steady states.
If w1Q1 >
w2Q2, then for t → ∞ we have x1 = Q1, x2 = 0,
xd = 1−Q1. If w1Q1 < w2Q2, on the other hand, the
steady state distribution if given by x1 = 0, x2 = Q2,
xd = 1 − Q2. The most interesting situation occurs
when for a given w1 and w2, the steady state depends
on the mutation rate. This happens if w1 > w2, but
ν1 < ν2, or vice versa. Namely, if we express Qi as
given in Eq. (1), we obtain from w1Q1 = w2Q2 the
critical copy ﬁdelity

qc = 1 − ln(w2/w1)
l(ν1 − ν2)

.

(11)

Clearly, qc can only be smaller than one if either
w1 > w2 and ν1 < ν2 or vice versa. Therefore,
this is a necessary (though not suﬃcient) condition
for the existence of two qualitatively diﬀerent steady
states in diﬀerent mutational regimes.
In the lan-
guage of physics, the transition from one of the two
steady state to the other is a ﬁrst order phase tran-
sition (Stanley 1971). The transition is of ﬁrst order
because the order parameter (which we can deﬁne to
be either x1 or x2) undergoes a discontinuous jump
from a ﬁnite value to zero at the critical mutation
rate.

The two phases are not just a mathematical curios-
ity, they have important biological interpretations.
The phase in which the sequences with the larger
wi survive can be considered the “normal” selection
regime, i.e., selection which favors faster replicating
individuals. We will refer to this situation as the
In the
phase of “selection for replication speed”.
other phase, however, the situation is exactly re-
versed, and the sequences with the lower intrinsic
replication rate w prevail. In this phase, the amount
of neutrality (or the robustness against mutations)
is more important, and we will consequently refer
to this situation as the phase of “selection for ro-
bustness”.
In Fig. 3, we show two example phase
diagrams. These diagrams demonstrate that the se-
lection for robustness is not a pathological situation
occurring only for extremely rare sets of parameters,
but that in fact both phases have to be considered
on equal grounds, none of them can be singled out
as the more common one. In particular, as the ratio
between w1 and w2 approaches unity, the selection
for robustness becomes more and more important.

4

As in the case of a single quasispecies on a neutral
network, we have tested our predictions with simu-
lations of self-replicating RNA sequences in a ﬂow
reactor. We assumed that sequences folding into ei-
ther Fold 1 or 2 (Fig. 1) were replicating with rates
w1 = 1 and w2 = 1.1, respectively, while all other
folds had a vanishing replication rate. In all results
presented below, we initialized the ﬂow reactor with
50% of the sequences folding into Fold 1, and the
remaining sequences folding into Fold 2.

Figure 4 shows a comparison between Eq. (10) and
four example runs. Apart from ﬁnite size ﬂuctua-
tions, which are to be expected in a simulation with
N = 1000, the analytic expression predicts the actual
population dynamics well.

In Fig. 5, we present measurements of the concen-
trations x1(t) and x2(t) as functions of the mutation
rate 1 − q, for a ﬁxed time t = 200. The points rep-
resent results averaged over 25 independent simula-
tions, and the lines stem from Eq. (10). In agreement
with the predictions from our model, we observe two
selection regimes, one in which the faster replicating
sequences dominate, and one in which the sequences
with the higher neutrality have a selective advantage.
The transition between the two phases occurs in this
particular case approximately at q = 0.98, and both
the analytical model and the simulations agree well
on this value. As is typical for a phase transition,
the ﬂuctuations close to the transition point increase
signiﬁcantly, and the time until either of the two qua-
sispecies has gone extinct diverges (the latter point
can be seen from the fact that close to the transition
point, the disadvantageous fold is still present in a
sizeable amount, while further away it has already
vanished completely from the population).

Figure 5 also shows that for very small popula-
tions, the predictive value of the diﬀerential equation
approach diminishes, presumably because the choice
of a single eﬀective copy ﬁdelity Q is not justiﬁed
anymore once a minimum population size has been
reached. However, as long as we are dealing with pop-
ulation sizes of several hundreds or more, our analyt-
ical calculations predict the simulation results very
well.

Probability of Fixation

Simulation Results

that selection acts on the product of replication rate

parameters, sequences with a lower replication rate
can outcompete those with a higher replication rate.
However, the competition experiments that we con-
ducted in the previous section were unrealistic in so
far that we assumed equal initial concentrations of
the two competing types of sequences. A more real-
istic assumption is that one type (the one with the
lower product wiQi) dominates the population, while
the second type is initially represented through only
a single individual. The idea behind this scenario is
of course that the second type (with higher product
wiQi) has arisen through a rare mutation. The ques-
tion in this context is whether the second type will
be able to dominate the population, i.e., whether it
will become ﬁxated.

In a standard population genetics scenario, the an-
swer to the above question is simple. If two sequences
replicate with w1 and w2, respectively, and mutations
between the two sequences can be neglected, then a
single sequence of type 2 (w2 > w1) will become ﬁx-
ated in a background of sequences of type 1 with
probability π = 1 − e−2s ≈ 2s, where s = w2/w1 − 1
is the selective advantage of the newly introduced
sequence type (Haldane 1927; Kimura 1964; Ewens
1979). Note, however, that this celebrated result is
only correct for a generational model with discrete
time steps. In a continuous time model, the equiva-
lent result reads π = s/(1 + s). This formula follows
from the solution to the problem of the Gambler’s
Ruin (Feller 1968; Lenski and Levin 1985) when tak-
ing the limit of a large population size.

Here, we are not dealing with individual sequences
replicating with rate wi, but rather with quasispecies
that grow with rate wiQi. A naive way to calculate
the ﬁxation probability in this case is simply to re-
place wi with wiQi in the expression for the selective
advantage, and hope that the result is correct. How-
ever, it is not clear from the outset that this approach
will work, because the factor Qi depends on the as-
sumption that a fully developed quasispecies with the
appropriate mean neutrality is already present. A
single sequence struggling for ﬁxation does not satisfy
this condition. Therefore, the actual ﬁxation prob-
ability might deviate from the one thus calculated,
in particular in circumstances in which a sequence
with smaller replication rate is supposed to overtake

an established quasispecies of sequences with higher
replication rate.

We performed ﬁxation experiments in both the “se-
lection for replication speed” and the “selection for
robustness” phase, in order to clarify whether the

a population of size N = 1000 to equilibrate, and
then introduced a single sequence of the supposedly
advantageous type. After 500 time steps, we deter-
mined whether the advantageous type had vanished
from the population or grown to a signiﬁcant propor-
tion. By repeating this procedure 100 times, we ob-
tained an estimate for the probability of ﬁxation. As
in the previous section, we used w1 = 1 and w2 = 1.1.
In Fig. 6, we compare our simulation results to the
predicted ﬁxation probability π = s/(1 + s). Within
the accuracy of our results, both agree well. This
is particularly interesting for mutation rates above
0.02, where we introduce a sequence of lower replica-
tion rate into a background of faster replicating se-
quences. The increased neutrality of the introduced
sequence is suﬃcient to let it rise to ﬁxation in a sig-
niﬁcant proportion of cases. Moreover, the product
wiQi is the sole determinant of the ﬁxation probabil-
ity. Whether the value of the product wiQi comes
mainly from the intrinsic growth rate wi of the se-
quences or from the eﬀective ﬁdelity Qi does not have
an observable inﬂuence on the dynamics.

Discussion

The good agreement between our analytical model
and our simulation results demonstrates that RNA
sequences evolving on a neutral network of identi-
cal secondary structure folds are well described by
only two parameters, their intrinsic replication rate
w and their eﬀective copy ﬁdelity Q. In the partic-
ular context of two competing distinct folds, we ﬁnd
furthermore that only the product of w and Q is of

the ratio between x1(t) and x2(t) depends only on
the respective products of w and Q, but not on the
individual values themselves.

Unlike the intrinsic replication rate w, which is a
property of the individual, the eﬀective ﬁdelity Q is a
group property, as it is given by the average over all
sequences in the population of the probability not to
“fall oﬀ” the neutral network. Thus, in the regime in
which Q dominates the evolutionary dynamics (the

6

phase of selection for robustness in Fig. 3), the evo-
lutionary success of an individual sequence depends
strongly on the properties of the group it belongs to.
In other words, we ﬁnd that selection acts on the
whole group of mutants, rather than on individuals,
despite the absence of standard factors supporting
group selection such as spatial subdivision of the pop-
ulation (Wilson 1979), altruistic behavior, parental
care (Maynard Smith 1993), or mutual catalytic sup-
port (Alves et al. 2001). Here, a sequence with a
comparatively high neutrality embedded into a neu-
tral network with a poor overall connection density
will be at a disadvantage with respect to a sequence
with a comparatively low neutrality that is, however,
part of a neutral network with high connection den-
sity. The overall higher ﬁdelity of a population on
the second network results in a larger fraction of se-
quences that actually reside on the network, which
in turn increases the chance that a particular se-
quence will be generated as mutant oﬀspring from
some other sequence. Moya et al. (2000) noted that
this type of group selection should follow from the
quasispecies equations, and that populations under
this type of selection would be best described by
an eﬀective group replication rate r. In the present
work, we have shown that this is indeed the case, and
we can also derive r (which is simply r = wQ) from
the quasispecies equations. Namely, the fact that the
population neutrality ν (which determines Q) is given
by the largest eigenvalue of the connection matrix of
neutral genotypes is a direct consequence of the qua-
sispecies equations (van Nimwegen et al. 1999).

Schuster and Swetina (1988) were the ﬁrst to point
out that at high mutation rates, the quasispecies
around the highest peak in the landscape can disap-
pear. They focused on situations in which the highest
and the second-highest peak in a landscape were of
almost equal height, while the immediate mutational
neighborhood of the second peak was less deleteri-
ous than the one of the ﬁrst peak. As a consequence,
their results seemed to imply that the phase of ’selec-
tion of robustness’ was only important in the case of
very similar peaks. Our results, on the other hand,
show that the diﬀerence in peak hight can be dra-
matic, if balanced by an equally dramatic diﬀerence
in robustness.

While our analytical results apply strictly speaking
only to inﬁnite populations, we have seen that in sim-

ulations for population sizes as small as N = 500, the
diﬀerential equation approach works well. Moreover,
in our experiments on the probability of ﬁxation, we
have seen that even very small numbers of the advan-
tageous group (in the extreme only a single sequence)
can rise to ﬁxation, despite their intrinsic replication
rate being smaller than that of the currently dom-
inating group. This result seems somewhat unin-
tuitive at ﬁrst, but can be easily understood. The
most important aspect of every ﬁxation event is the
very ﬁrst replication of the new genotype, and the
smaller its selective advantage, the more likely it is
not to replicate even once. Now, if a new mutant
with a poor replication rate wnew but high eﬀective
ﬁdelity Qnew arises in a population that is dominated
by sequences with large intrinsic replication rate, we
would intuitively assume that the mutant will hardly
ever replicate even once, and therefore will never get
a chance to employ its superior ﬁdelity. However,
this is not correct if the eﬀective ﬁdelity of the dom-
inating sequences, Qdom, is low. From Eq. (4), we
ﬁnd that the concentration of sequences that actually
replicate is given by Qdom. Therefore, even though
the sequences that replicate do so at a high rate, the
actual number of births that occur is small, compa-
rable to the one in a population in which all individ-
uals reproduce with rate wdomQdom. Therefore, the
newly introduced genotype is relatively safe from be-
ing washed out prematurely, and ﬁxation takes place
at the predicted rate.

Conclusions

We have demonstrated that for a population in a
landscape where neutral mutants abound, the prod-
uct of intrinsic replication rate w and eﬀective copy-
ﬁdelity Q is being maximized under selection, rather
than the intrinsic replication rate alone. This ob-
servation has led to the natural distinction between
two modes of selection, one in which intrinsic repli-
cation rate is favored, and one in which robustness
(high Q) is more important. In the latter phase, the
success of a single sequence depends strongly on the
mutant cloud the sequence belongs to. Our results
thus demonstrate that the unit of selection in molec-
ular evolution is indeed the quasispecies, as proposed
by Eigen and Schuster (1979), and not the individual
replicating sequence. In particular, the probability of

ﬁxation of a single advantageous mutant in an estab-
lished quasispecies can be predicted accurately with
results from standard population genetics, provided
we consider the overall growth rates of the established
quasispecies and the quasispecies potentially formed
by the mutant, rather than the replication rates of
mutant and established wild type.

Figure 1: The two diﬀerent folds used in this study.
Both consist of the same number of base pairs (l =
62), but Fold 1 has a higher neutrality (ν = 0.442)
than Fold 2 (ν = 0.366). See also Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Decay of the steady state concentration
x1 as a function of 1 − q for two example secondary
structures. The solid and the dashed line are given
by exp[−l(1 − q)(1 − νi)] with l = 62. The values
for ν1 and ν2 have been obtained from a ﬁt of this
expression to the measured data (shown as points
with bars indicating the standard error).

Figure 3: Typical phase diagram following from
Eq. 11. We used l = 100, w2 = 1, and ν1 = 0.5,
as well as ν2 = 0.6 in graph a) and w1 = 1.5 in graph
b).

Figure 4: Concentrations x1(t) and x2(t) as functions
of the time t for a copy ﬁdelity of q = 0.99. The
thick lines represent the analytic predictions from
Eqs. (10a) and (10b), and the thin lines stem from
simulations with N = 1000.

Figure 5: Concentrations x1(200) (dashed lines) and
x2(200) (solid lines) as functions of the per-nucleotide
mutation rate 1 − q. The lines represent the analytic
predictions. The points represent the average over
25 independend simulation runs each, with bars indi-
cating the standard error. We performed the simula-
tions with four diﬀerent population sizes, N = 5000
(a), N = 1000 (b), N = 500 (c), and N = 100
(d). The initial concentrations in all simulations were
x1(0) = x2(0) = 0.5, xd(0) = 0.

Figure 6: Probability of ﬁxation as a function of the
mutation rate. Below 1 − q = 0.02, we are looking
at the probability of ﬁxation of a single sequence of
type 2 in a full population of sequences of type 1.
Above 1 − q = 0.02, we are considering the reversed
conﬁguration. The solid and dashed line represent
the analytical prediction π = s/(1 + s), the points
stem from simulations (bars indicate standard error).

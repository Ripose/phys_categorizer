Abstract

Bacterial chemotaxis is controlled by receptor conformational changes in

response to the change of ambient chemical concentration.

In a statistical

mechanical approach, the signalling is a thermodynamic average quantity, de-

termined by the temperature and the total energy of the system, including

both ligand-receptor interaction and receptor-receptor interaction. The con-

formation of a receptor dimer is not only inﬂuenced by whether it is bound to

a ligand, but also inﬂuenced by the conformation-dependent interaction with

its neighbors. This physical theory suggests to biology a new understand-

ing of cooperation in ligand binding and receptor signalling problems. How

much experimental support of this approach can be obtained from the cur-

rent available data? What are the parameter values? What is the practical

information for experiments? Here we make comparisons between the theory

and recent experimental results. Although currently comparisons can only be

semi-quantitative or qualitative , consistency can clearly be seen. The theory

I. INTRODUCTION

Bacterial chemotaxis refers to the phenomenon that a bacterium such as Escherichia coli

swims towards higher concentration of attractant and lower concentration of repellent [1–4].

This is because with the rate determined by the change of the ambient chemical concen-

tration, the motors switch between counterclockwise and clockwise rotations, consequently

the cell switches between tumbling and running. The ratio between the frequencies of the

two rotation modes is determined by the rate at which kinase CheA phosphorylates CheY,

which binds the base of a motor. CheA phosphorylation rate is regulated by the receptor

conformational state, which is inﬂuenced by ligand binding. The receptors are dimeric and is

joined to a CheA dimer by a CheW dimer, furnishing a signalling complex. Hence a receptor

dimer can be regarded as a basic unit, as supported by the ﬁnding that a receptor dimer with

a damaged subunit can still work [5]. Because of thermal ﬂuctuation, even in the absence of

ligand binding, or in a fully adapted situation, there is still a certain probability distribution

of the receptor conformational states; microscopically a receptor dimer stochastically ﬂips

between the two states. Attractant binding changes the probability distribution, causing the

receptor dimer to be more likely in the state corresponding to lower CheA phosphorylation

rate. On a longer time scale, after an initial response to ligand concentration change, the

activity of the system returns to the pre-stimulus level. A careful consideration of such a

basic picture already ﬁnds the ideas of statistical mechanics necessary: with the presence of

thermal ﬂuctuation, it is the probability distribution of the the receptor states, rather than

a deﬁnite state, that is monitored by ligand concentration change and monitors the motor

rotation bias. However, this point is not universally appreciated in biological literature.

The chemotactic response is very sensitive [6], and it had been conjectured that there

might be cooperation between receptors or the signalling complex so that the signal could

be ampliﬁed [7,3]. The fact that most of the receptors cluster together at a pole of the cell

provides further clues for cooperation between receptors [8,9]. It was found experimentally

that the clustering of receptors was not to be favorable for counting statistics and that the

2

receptor cluster does not favor a special end of the cell [10]. This is an indication that there

is a special reason, which may well be to have the receptor-receptor interaction.

With a detailed analysis on the possibility of cooperation between receptor dimers, we

constructed a statistical mechanical theory to provide a picture of how the receptors cooper-

ate through physical interaction and how the thermal ﬂuctuation makes statistical mechanics

important in the signalling process [11,12]. As will be stressed here, the ﬁrst message from

this approach is an emphasis on thermal ﬂuctuation. Moreover, thermal ﬂuctuation helps

to distinguish diﬀerent stimuli. Because of large separation of time scales, the thermal ﬂuc-

tuation can be treated as quasi-equilibrium, so equilibrium statistical mechanical can give

a reasonable response-stimuli relation. Hence the basic of our theory is useful no matter

whether there is interaction between receptor dimers. The second message of this theory

is that the anticipated cooperation is just physical receptor-receptor interaction between

nearest-neighboring receptor dimers. Therefore the conformational state of a receptor dimer

is not only inﬂuenced by ligand binding of itself, but also by the receptor-receptor inter-

action which is dependent on conformations of the two neighboring receptor dimers. The

third message is that the large separation of time scales leads to a complementary usage of

equilibrium statistical mechanics for the calculation of response in a shorter time scale and

a non-equilibrium description of the adaptation in a longer time scale. Dynamics on the

longer time scale determines whether randomness of ligand binding is quenched or annealed

on the shorter time scale of quasi-equilibrium state, as will be elaborated later on. In the

high temperature limit, this does not make a diﬀerence on the average signalling. Based on

some aspects of the theory [11], a numerical simulation was made [13].

Recently there appeared some experimental data which are more directly relevant for the

many-body nature of the receptor cluster and the possible cooperation [14–16]. Therefore

it is interesting and important to make comparisons between the theory and the experi-

mental results, testing the theory on one hand, and providing some information on what

experimental data are wanted on the other hand. However, we do not expect the model in

the current form can ﬁt perfectly all data on this complex system, rather, what we provide

3

is a theoretical framework amenable for reﬁnements. For example, for simplicity, we have

only considered the cooperation between the receptor dimer, while extensions to possible

cooperations among other components at later stages of the signalling process, for exam-

ple, CheA, CheY, CheZ and the switch complex, is straightforward if concrete information

is available. The idea of receptor-receptor interaction broadens the view on cooperation,

which previously largely refers to the existence of more than one binding sites, and thus the

occupancy is larger than that with one binding site, as described by the model presented by

Hill a century ago [18]. For simplicity, we try to preserve the scenario of one binding site,

while the extension to the situation of more binding sites is straightforward if needed. Our

strategy is to start with the minimum model.

With improvement and simpliﬁcation, we ﬁrst synthesis various aspects of the theory.

Then we make comparisons with the experimental results, followed by summary and discus-

sions.

II. THEORY

Consider a lattice of receptor dimers, as shown in Fig. 1. Let the coordinate number

be ν, which is 6 for a honeycomb lattice and is 4 for a square lattice. The exact coordinate

number in reality is subject to experimental investigations. The behavior of the system is

determined by its energy function, or Hamiltonian, which can be written as

H(t) = −

TijViVj −

HiVi +

WiVi.

(1)

<ij>
X

i

Vi is a variable characterizing the conformation of receptor dimer i, so it is likely the position

of the receptor molecule with respective to a certain equilibrium position. In the popular

two-state approach, Vi assumes one of two values V 0 or V 1. Hi is the inﬂuence, or force,

due to ligand binding and the modulation of methylation level, Hi = 0 if there is no ligand

binding, while Hi = H if there is a ligand binding. −HiVi is the energy due to ligand

binding, hence ligand binding causes the energy diﬀerence between the two conformations

4

to make a shift of H(V 1 −V 0). Wi(V 0 −V 1) is the original energy diﬀerence between the two

conformations. hiji denotes nearest neighbouring pairs, −TijViVj is the interaction energy

between the neighboring receptor dimers.

For convenience, deﬁning Si = 2(Vi −V 0)/∆V −1, where ∆V = V 1 −V 0, one transforms

the Hamiltonian to

H(t) = −

JijSiSj −

Bi(t)Si +

UiSi,

(2)

Xhiji

i
X

i
X

where Si = 1, −1 represents the two conformational states of the receptor dimer at site i,

Jij = Tij∆V 2/4, Bi = Hi∆V /2, Ui = ∆V Wi/2 − ∆V 2

j Tij. We refer to Bi as ﬁeld. For

simplicity, it is assumed that Jij = J and Ui = U are independent of i and j. Bi = 0 if there

P

is no ligand binding, while Bi = B = H∆V /2 if there is a ligand binding. Hence energy

diﬀerence due to ligand binding between the two conformations are 2Bi. USi represents the

original energy in the absence of ligand binding. Eq. (1) and (2) can be justiﬁed as follows.

It is reasonable to assume an interaction energy proportional to (Vi − Vj)2, which can be

reduced to −TijViVj, with constant terms neglected and the terms proportional to Si or Sj

included in

i UiSi. On the other hand, this assumption is simple enough to allow a feasible

treatment which captures the essential features.

P

From now on, we focus on Eq. (2). Suppose that before time t = 0, there is no ligand

bound to the system, or there are bound ligands, but the system is fully adapted. Hence

Bi(t < 0) = 0. Afterward, at time t = 0, the occupancy, i.e. the fraction of receptor dimers

with ligands bound, changes to c. Hence the occupancy change is δc = c. This means

Bi(t = 0) = B0

i , with

B, with probability c

0, with probability 1 − c

B0

i = 



(3)

The occupancy c is determined by the ligand concentration L, c = L/(L + Kd), where the

dissociation constant Kd is on a time scale during which the receptor has undergone many

ﬂips between diﬀerent conformations, hence it is an average and phenomenological quantity.

5

On the other hand, through the modulation of methylation level by CheB and CheR,

there is a negative feedback from the receptor state Si to the ﬁeld Bi, with a time delay tr.

A simple quantitative representation of this feedback is

dBi(t)
dt

= −σ[Si(t − tr) − m0],

(4)

where σ > 0, m0 is the pre-stimulus average of Si. If she likes, one might call this self-tuning.

A remarkable feature of this system is the large separation of time scales. Ligand bind-

ing and conformation change occur within only millisecond, while overall time needed to

complete the adaptation, through the slow modulation of methylation level, is on the scale

of many seconds to minutes [19,2]. We note that in most cases, ligand debinding is on a

much longer time scale than ligand binding, seen as follows. Consider the kinetics of the

following reaction

L + R ⇀↽ RL,

(5)

where R represents the receptor without ligand binding, while RL represents liganded re-

ceptor. k+ and k− are reaction rates for the binding and debinding, respectively. The ratio

between the time scales of debinding and binding is k+L/k− ≡ L/Kd, where Kd is the

dissociation constant. A typical value is Kd ∼ 1.2µM [2]. Usually, L is much larger, so

the debinding time scale is much longer than the time scale of ligand binding and receptor

conformational change. In extreme cases when L is comparable to Kd, debinding time scale

is comparable to binding time scale.

With the large separation of time scales, the treatment under the above formulation

becomes easier. One may discretize the time on the scale of adaptation, according to the

feedback delay time. t is thus replaced by an integer τ , which is the integer part of t/tr. On

the other hand,each instant τ is still very long compared with the time scale of conformational

change. Hence the activity at each τ is an average quantity m(τ ), which can be calculated

from the Hamiltonian in (2) by standard methods of statistical mechanics. Note that the

average activity m just corresponds to the time scale of the measured quantities such as

6

motor bias, longer than the very short period in which the receptor is in either of the two

conformations, but shorter than the adaptation time. In making the average, an important

thing is that the randomness of the ﬁeld is usually quenched since L >> Kd, and is annealed

otherwise. In fact we obtain a generalized version of the so-called random-ﬁeld Ising model;

in a conventional random-ﬁeld Ising model, the average ﬁeld vanishes, but it is generically

non-zero in our model. In the long time scale, the ﬁeld changes because of feedback. It can

be expressed as Bi(τ ) = B0

i + M(τ ), where M(τ ) is an induced ﬁeld due to methylation

modulation,

equal.

δc is then

M(τ ) = −σ

[m(k) − m0].

Before being stimulated, m(τ < 0) = m0 is determined by U. m0 = 0 if and only if

U = 0. m = 0 means that each receptor is in either of the two conformations with equal

probability, and thus the rates of counterclockwise and clockwise rotations of the motors are

In most cases, the randomness of B0

i is quenched, the general relation between m(τ ) and

concentration is lower than Kd, the randomness of B0

m =

δc[eβ(f (m)+B) − e−β(f (m)+B)] + (1 − δc)[eβf (m) − e−βf (m)]

m(τ = 0) corresponds to the response-stimulus relation, as usually referred to. After the

step increase at τ = 0, m(τ ) always decrease back towards the pre-stimulus value m0. This

is the robustness of exact adaptation [20]. Practically the adaptation time is obtained when

m − m0 reaches the detection threshold m∗.

7

The results can be simpliﬁed under the condition that the thermal noise is so strong that

βνJ and βB are not large. Then both Eq. (7) and Eq. (8) can be simpliﬁed to

1 − βνJ represents the enhancement of response compared with non-interacting scenario.

One may obtain the adaptation time t∗, after which m − m0 is less than the detection

.

At exact adaptation, setting m(τ ) = m0, one may obtain the total induced ﬁeld due

to methylation modulation M ∗ = Bc. Then for the next stimulus, suppose the occupancy

changes from δc to δc + ∆c at a later time τ1, it can be found that the result with the

occupancy δc + ∆c and the induced ﬁeld M ∗ is the same as that with the occupancy ∆c

and without M ∗, that is, the previous occupancy change has been canceled by M ∗, therefore

the fully adaptation with ligand binding is equivalent to no ligand binding. So m(τ ≥ τ1)

is given by the above relevant equations with τ changed to τ − τ1, and δc substituted by

∆c. One can thus simply forget the pre-adaptation history, and re-start the application of

the above formulation with τ1 shifted to 0. The cancellation holds exactly only under the

assumption of small βνJ and βB, which is likely the reality. The ﬁniteness of detection

threshold further widens the practical range of its validity.

III. COMPARISONS BETWEEN EXPERIMENTS AND THE THEORY

A. Clustering.

The clustering was recently studied in greater details [16]. The observed clustering of

receptors and the co-localization of the CheA, CheY, and CheZ with the receptors is a favor

for the eﬀects of interactions. An in vitro receptor lattice formation was also observed (Ying

and Lai, 2000).

B. Response-stimulus relation.

A basic prediction of our theory is the response-stimulus relation. Note that the time

scale of the response, corresponding to m in our theory , is longer than the very short lifetime

of the individual conformations, but is only transient on the time scale of the adaptation

process. A remarkable thing is that m in our theory is measurable. Motor rotation bias

was measured [14]. From this result we can obtain m, as follows. The population motor

bias is b = fccw/(fccw + fcw), where fccw and fcw are rates of counterclockwise and clockwise

rotations, respectively. Suppose the value of b is r1 for conformational state 1, and is r−1

for conformational state −1. Hence the the average bias should be:

b = r1x + r−1(1 − x),

(14)

where x is the average fraction of receptors with state 1. x is related to m by m = x−(1−x) =

2x − 1. So if we know r1 and r−1, we can obtain m from the average b. In literature, there

is no investigation on r1 and r−1. A simple assumption which is often implicitly assumed in

literature is that r1 = 1, r−1 = 0, that is, state 1 corresponds to CCW, state −1 corresponds

to CW. We follow this assumption here. But it should be kept in mind that an experimental

investigation on r1 and r−1 would be very valuable. Therefore, for the time being, we use

b =

m + 1
2

,

9

(15)

Thus from the pre-stimulus value of b, one may determine m0, and thus βU. An empirical

formula is b = 1 − 0.0012(rcd − 360), where rcd is the absolute angular rate of change of

direction of the cell centroid in degree · s−1 [14,24]. From [24], the pre-stimulus value of rcd

is known as ∼ 600, so the pre-stimulus value of mb is ∼ 0.712. Hence

m0 ≈

βU
1 − βνJ

≈ 0.424.

(16)

The occupancy change used in [14] was calculated from the concentrations by assuming

that the ligand randomly binds one of two possible binding sites: in addition to the site with

Kd ∼ 1.2µM, as widely acknowledged [19], there is another site with Kd ∼ 70µM. This was

based on an earlier attempt to have a better ﬁtting for the adaptation time [21]. However,

as told above, we try to make things as simple as possible in the ﬁrst instance, so prefer

to preserve the scenario of one binding site with Kd ∼ 1.2µM. Actually with one binding

site, as discussed later on, it seems that our theory can ﬁt the adaptation time by choosing

appropriate parameter values, thus improve the coherence between various data. So we ﬁrst

transform the occupancy given in [14]. One has

cJ =

(c1 + c2),

1
2

where cJ represents the occupancy used by Jasuja et al., c1 corresponds to dissociation

constant K1 = 1.2µM, c2 corresponds to dissociation constant K2 = 70µM. From cl =

L/(L + Kl) for l = 1, 2, one obtains the change of the occupancy

δcl =

KlδL
(L + δL + Kl)(L + Kl)

,

where δL is the change of ligand concentration. Since δL << L, one may obtain δc1 =

2δcJ /(1 + α), where α ≈ K1(L + K1)2/K2(L + K2)2. With L ≈ 10µM, α ≈ 1, one has

δc1 ≈ δcJ . Therefore under this condition, we may simply use the occupancy used in [14].

Eq. (15) leads to the relation between the initial change of m and that of the motor bias,

δb,

(17)

(18)

(19)

δm = 2δb,

10

where δm = m(δc, τ = 0) − m0.

So the data in Fig. 3 of [14] can be transformed to δm − δc relation as shown in our

Fig. 2. Unfortunately, it is notable that the data is limited to very low values of occupancy

change! Nevertheless, a qualitative ﬁtting can be made. According Eq. (9), where τ is set

to 0, we ﬁt the data with a straight line δm = aδc. From the slop of the ﬁtting line, we

obtain

a =

βB
1 − βνJ

≈ 10.49.

C. Adaptation time.

(20)

Eq. (18) tells us that with a same concentration change, the occupancy change and

thus the response decreases with the increase of pre-stimulus ligand concentration. This is

veriﬁed by Fig. 7 of [21]. Eq. (11) predicts that the adaptation time increases linearly with,

but not proportional to, the logarithm of occupancy change. This is consistent with the

available experimental results. It had been thought that the adaptation time is proportional

to the occupancy change [22,23,21]. We found that a logarithmic relation is also consistent

with the current available data. As an example, using Kd = 3 × 10−7, we transform the

better set of the data, the left plot, in Fig. 4 of [23] to the occupancy change. For accuracy,

the data points at the highest and lowest concentration changes are dropped since they

are close to the detection limit. and it is hard to recognize the diﬀerence in adaptation

time with the the other data points closest to them, though the concentration changes are

quite diﬀerent. The transformed data is shown in our Fig 3(a). While there could be a

proportional (not only linear) ﬁtting, as usually done, they may be ﬁtted by a logarithmic

relation, t∗ = τ ∗ · tr = g log10 δc + h, with g = 95.151 and h = 124.0574. From Eq. (11), we

have

and

tr
− log10(1 − βσ

1−βνJ )

= g.

(21)

11

We use δc∗ ≈ 0.004 [21]. and suppose tr ≈ 0.1s. Then one may ﬁnd

tr[log10 δc∗]
log10(1 − βσ

1−βνJ )

= h.

βσ
1 − βνJ

≈ 0.0024 to 0.0045.

(22)

(23)

where the ﬁrst value estimated from (21), and the second from (22). They are quite close,

as an indication of the consistency of the theory.

Furthermore our predicted logarithmic relation may explain the discrepancy in analysis

of data in Fig. 4 of [21] about a relation between the adaptation time and the concentra-

tion. The logarithm can simply decrease the predicted value of adaptation time, without

resorting to the assumption of the existence of two binding sites. We have tried to make

a quantitative ﬁtting for the data in Fig. 4 of [21]. Using Kd = 1.2µM, we transform the

ligand concentration to the occupancy change, as shown in our Fig. 4. To make better use

of the data, we ignore data point for δc > 0.95, because the ﬁniteness of detection threshold

may cause uncertainty in deciding the adaptation time; the data for δc > 0.95 show too large

variation for so close values of δc. The ﬁtting straight line is t∗ = τ ∗ · tr = g log10 δc + h,

with g = 156.3513 and h = 114.9912. From (21) and (22), one may ﬁnd

βσ
1 − βνJ

≈ 0.0015 to 0.0047.

(24)

Again, they are quite close. It is very impressive that (23) and (24) are very close, though

they are obtained for diﬀerent sets of data.

D. CheA activity.

Bornhorst and Falke studied relative CheA activity and made analyses using Hill model

with non-integer coeﬃcient [15]. Here we analyze the data from the viewpoint of our theory.

Suppose S = 1, −1 correspond respectively to CheA activity A1 and A−1. Then the

average CheA activity is 1

2(A1 + A−1) + m

2 (A1 − A−1). Consequently the relative CheA

activity, as measured in [15]. is

12

R =

(A1 + A−1) + (A1 − A−1)m(δc)
(A1 + A−1) + (A1 − A−1)m(δc = 0)

Combined with Eqs. (16) and (20), it tells that the ratio between the two levels of CheA

activity is A−1/A1 ≈ 164.77. Very interestingly, this result of deduction is in good consistence

with the available experimental information that this ratio is more than 100 [2]. Again, this

is an indication of the consistency of the theory.

However, there is discrepancy in the ﬁtting. This may be because of high temperature

approximation, and may be because of some other minor factors not considered here for

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

We suggest that statistical mechanics is helpful and important in understanding receptor

signalling and adaptation. We have made semi-quantitative comparisons between the theory

and recent experiments to obtain estimations of parameter values. However, for such a

complex system, we do not expect the ﬁtting is perfect. The thermal ﬂuctuation in a

cell is very strong, kBT ≈ 4pN ˙nm ≈ 0.025eV , comparable to the energy scales, so we

simplify the formulation by using high temperature approximation. Then Eqs. (9) and (10)

essentially contain all the information we need. 1 − βνJ characterizes the enhancement

of signalling by receptor-receptor interaction. With this simpliﬁed formulation, we look at

recent experimental results. From the data on pre-stimulus motor rotation bias [24], we

obtain the pre-stimulus activity, as in Eq. (16), implying that there are approximately 70%

receptor dimers are at the state corresponding the lower rate of CheA autophosphorylation.

13

Although the data of the response-stimulus relation are not very limited, from this we

estimate that βB/(1 − βνJ) ≈ 10.5. Eq. (20), which characterizes the eﬀect of ligand

binding. We study adaptation time for two diﬀerent sets of data [23,21], and ﬁnd the

feedback strength compared with coupling, βσ/(1−βνJ), is approximately 0.0024 to 0.0045,

or 0.0015 to 0.0047, respectively. These numbers obtained from diﬀerent data or by using

diﬀerent methods are impressively close, as a good sign of the consistency of theory. From

the data on the relative CheA activity [15], we obtain Eq. (26), which gives the relation

between the two levels of CheA activity corresponding to the two conformations of the

receptor dimer. Combined with other results, it tells that the ratio between the two levels

of CheA activity is A−1/A1 ≈ 164.77, in good consistence with the available experimental

information on this ratio.

We need an improvement of other already available data, especially we need a signiﬁ-

cant increase of the range of occupancy change in response-stimulus relation. We also need

a clearer relation between adaptation time and occupancy change. More accurate mea-

surement of A−1/A1 can provide more accurate test and reﬁnement of the theory. More

information is also needed on the relation between the conformational state and the relative

rate of the two rotation modes of the motor.

Independent determination of the dissociate constant is also important. Most exciting

experiments might be direct measurements of the conformational states V 0, V 1, and the

coupling coeﬃcient Tij. First, a clariﬁcation on whether the conformational change is rota-

tion or a vertical displacement is needed. For the former, V 0 and V 1 are angles, while H,

the eﬀect of ligand binding, is a torque. For the latter, V 0 and V 1 are positions, while H is

a force. The receptor-receptor interaction can be determined by measuring the relation of

force or torque on one receptor dimer and the conformations of its neighbors. This would be

a direct test of the conformation-dependent interaction. A determination of the geometry of

the lattice is also interesting, from which we can obtain the value of βνJ, and consequently

other parameter values.

Our theory is entirely diﬀerent from Hill model. An integer Hill coeﬃcient is understood

14

as the number of ligands bound to a receptor. A non-integer Hill coeﬃcient, as often used,

is not clear conceptually though could be tuned to ﬁt the data. Nonetheless, from mean

ﬁeld point of view, the eﬀect of receptor-receptor interaction could be viewed as eﬀective

additional ligand binding. Therefore from this perspective, the conclusion of Bornhorst and

Falke on limited cooperativity is consistent with strong thermal ﬂuctuation in our theory.

Here we specialize in chemotactic receptors, however, the theory also applies to many

other receptor systems. For example, state-dependent co-inhibition between transmitter-

gated cation channels was observed [25]. Clustering of GABAA receptors and the decrease

of aﬃnity was also studied [26], in a way similar to the analyses of Bohrnhost and Falke for

chemotactic receptors, and can also be explained by our theory as an indication of receptor-

receptor interaction and thermal noise.

In many receptor systems, clustering, or called

oligomerization, together with signalling, occurs as a response to stimulus. This situation is

dealt with elsewhere.

In ﬁnishing this paper, let me list some new experiments anticipated from the point of

view of this theory. (1) Direct determination of conformational change due to interaction

with another receptor dimer. (2) Independent determination of dissociate constant using

other methods. (3) Investigations on the responses corresponding to ﬁxed conformational

states, thus r1 and r−1 discussed above is determined. (4) Direct measurements on CheA and

CheY activities. (5) More clariﬁcation on the relation between the receptor state and CheA

activity. (6) Increasing the range of occupancy change in response-stimulus relations, and

more accurate determination of pre-stimulus occupancy and occupancy change. (7) More

accurate determination on adaptation time as a function of both pre-stimulus occupancy

and the occupancy change. (8) Quantitative determination of the details of feedback due to

change of the methylation level.

account, and this calculation, even if done in a right way, will not give the maximum

concentration, as expected by the authors, but only an improvement on the minimum

one; what was thought to be the minimum one is that without consideration of the over-

receptors form a single cluster, while the assumption in this paper that ligand binding

of one receptor equally change the activity of each receptor in a cluster would lead to a

constant response to diﬀerent stimulus.

An evolution equation of the population genetics: relation to the density-matrix
theory of quasiparticles with general dispersion laws

V. Bez´ak∗
Department of Solid State Physics, Comenius University, 842 48 Bratislava, Slovakia

The Waxman-Peck theory of the population genetics is discussed in regard of soil bacteria. Each
bacterium is understood as a carrier of a phenotypic parameter p. The central aim is the calculation
of the probability density with respect to p, Φ(p, t; p0), of the carriers living at time t > 0, provided
that initially, at t0 = 0, all bacteria carried the phenotypic parameter p0 = 0. The theory involves
two small parameters: the mutation probability µ and a parameter γ involved in a function w(p)
deﬁning the ﬁtness of the bacteria to survive the generation time τ and give birth to oﬀspring. The
mutation from a state p to a state q is deﬁned by a Gaussian with a dispersion σ2
m. The author
focuses attention on a function ϕ(p, t) which determines uniquely the function Φ(p, t; p0) and satisﬁes
a linear equation (Waxman’s equation). The Green function of this equation is mathematically
identical with the one-particle Bloch density matrix where µ characterizes the order of magnitude of
the potential energy. (In the x-representation, the potential energy is proportional to the inverted
Gaussian with the dispersion σ2
m.) The author solves Waxman’s equation in the standard style of a
perturbation theory and discusses how the solution depends on the choice of the ﬁtness function w(p).
In a sense, the function c(p) = 1−w(p)/w(0) is analogous to the dispersion function E(p) of ﬁctitious
quasiparticles. In contrast to Waxman’s approximation where c(p) was taken as a quadratic function,
c(p) ≈ γp2, the author exempliﬁes the problem with another function, c(p) = γ[1 − exp(− ap2)],
where γ is small but a may be large. The author shows that the use of this function in the theory
of the population genetics is the same as the use of a non-parabolic dispersion law E = E(p) in the
density-matrix theory. With a general function c(p), the distribution function Φ(p, t; 0) is composed
of a delta-function component, N (t)δ(p), and a blurred component. When discussing the limiting
transition for t → ∞, the author shows that his function c(p) implies that N (t) → N (∞) 6= 0 in
contrast with the asymptotics N (t) → 0 resulting from the use of Waxman’s function c(p) ∼ p2.

INTRODUCTION

During the past century, the development of the quan-
tum theory has been paralleled with the development
of the theory of stochastic processes. When comparing
the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation of the quan-
tum mechanics with the Fokker-Planck equation of the
stochastic dynamics, we may assert that both these equa-
tions are of the same kind. Mathematically speaking,
both these equations are linear second-order partial dif-
ferential equations of the parabolic type. The Fokker-
Planck equation can be derived for any process which
can be described by the Langevin equation ηdx(t)/dt
−
F (x(t)) = f (t) (cf. e.g.
[1, 2]). In the Langevin equa-
tion, η > 0 is a deterministic constant, F (x) is a de-
terministically deﬁned real-valued function and f (t) is a
stochastically deﬁned zero-centered stationary Gaussian
white-noise function. (As a rule, x(t) and f (t) are con-
sidered as real random functions of the real time variable
t. The stationarity of f (t) is meant in the stochastic
sense.) Using the angular brackets
for the averaging
with respect to the randomness of f (t), we assume that

Equation (4) is known as the real Schr¨odinger equation.
If t is replaced by ¯hβ, where kBT = 1/β, equation
(4), with some change of symbols, becomes the Bloch
equation for the one-particle canonical density matrix of
boltzons of a constant (eﬀective) mass in the thermo-
dynamic equilibrium at the temperature T [3]. Thus,
when comparing equations (1) and (4), we can always
juxtapose the Brownian dynamics and the quantum the-
ory. (This juxtaposition can also be based on Feynman’s
path-integral theory [4, 5].) The transition from the for-
malism of the Brownian theory to the formalism of the
quantum theory is easy since if we deﬁne the driving
dVB(x)/dx, we can directly calculate the
force F (x) =
function V (x) according to equation (5). (Vice versa, if
one tries to ﬁnd F (x) corresponding to a given function
V (x), one has to solve equation (5) which is nonlinear.
Equation (5) is known as the Riccati equation. Cf. any
e.g. [6].
handbook on nonlinear diﬀerential equations
Recently the usefulness of the Riccati equation in solving
various problems of classical and quantum mechanics has
been widely corroborated [7
11]. Nonetheless, except
for the rare possibility to derive analytical solutions F (x)
of this equation in some cases when V (x) is chosen in a
very simple and very special form, equation (5) cannot be
solved otherwise than numerically. Thus, the problem of
ﬁnding a Brownian model to a given quantum-mechanical
model is relatively diﬃcult.)

In evolutionary theories of various populations, we may
ln n(t), taking n(t) as the number of
use x(t) = ln n(t)
individuals of a certain kind at the time instant t and
deﬁning ln n(t) as an average value of ln n(t). Since n(t)
may represent very large numbers, n(t) may be treated
as a continuous function so that the values of x(t) may
span the whole set of real numbers. Since mutations are
random events, a formal stochastic theory of the popu-
lation genetics can certainly be based on the use of the
Langevin equation and, correspondingly, of the Fokker-
Planck equation (1). If it is advantageous, we may also
use the equivalent Schr¨odinger-type equation (4).

Notwithstanding, recently Waxman has shown that
there is also another mathematical relation between
the population genetics and the quantum mechanics
[12]. Waxman’s theory concerns a simpliﬁed, but well-
founded, model that we call the Waxman-Peck model.
[13, 14] and references quoted therein.) Wax-
(Cf.

representation, the ‘potential energy’ function

Obviously, if
matical relation between the evolution equation of the
population genetics and the quantum theory becomes
somewhat more sophisticated than in Waxman’s case.
Namely, when paying heed to the x-representation, we
have generally to consider a more complicated equation
than the real Schr¨odinger equation: in general, our equa-
tion, with the Hamilton operator E(ˆp) + V (x), where
c(p), is a functional diﬀerential equation. (Note
E(p)

theorists, such an equation is familiar as the transformed
eﬀective mass equation (cf. e.g. the monograph [15] or
our paper [16]). This equation was invented for envelope
wave functions of electrons in crystalline solids.
(Syn-
onymously, we may also speak of the real Schr¨odinger-
Wannier equation. It is identical with the ‘one-particle
Bloch equation’ for the canonical density-matrix with the
Hamiltonian E(ˆp) + V (x).)

From the viewpoint of the eﬀectiveness of calculations
in the present paper, we deem the momentum represen-
tation better than the x-representation. Under the as-
sumption of the smallness of the parameter µ, we can
apply the ‘plane-wave perturbation theory’ (Section III)
of the density-matrix theory. For a broad class of ﬁtness
functions, the distribution function of the theory of the
population genetics can be expressed as a linear expres-
sion of the mutation parameter µ.

II. THE WAXMANN-PECK MODEL OF THE
POPULATION GENETICS

Let us assume that a large enough habitat (such as
a given volume of soil) hosts bacteria of a certain kind.
The habitat yields space, food, moisture, temperature,
inhibitory substances and other needs for the survival of
the bacteria in the sense that the total number of the bac-
teria will never decrease to zero and will never increase
to inﬁnity. Most of bacteria are free-living microorgan-
isms multiplying by simple ﬁssion. This means that their
reproduction is asexual. In other words, each bacterial
individual has only one parent. The typical number of
bacteria may be huge indeed: one gram of soil may con-
tain several hundreds million bacteria. Although the bac-
teria are small organisms
usually 0.3 - 2 micrometres
in diameter
their morphology is well distinguishable
microscopically.

−

−

There are two most frequent shapes of soil bacteria:
short rods and (slightly deformed) spheres. In both these
cases, we may characterize each bacterium by its size

−

−

−

s. For instance, if the bacterium resembles a rod, we
deﬁne s as the length of the rod. Denoting the average
of ln s as ln s, we deﬁne the phenotypic parameter as
ln s. Recalling to biology, we consider the
p = ln s
phenotypic parameter as an inheritable value.
If there
were no mutations in the reproduction of the bacteria,
all the bacterial individuals in each generation would be
equally long, i.e. p would be a constant equal to p0 = 0.
But then, the mutations
however infrequent they may
be
account for a dispersal of the value p among the
individuals, despite the fact that all individuals under
consideration do still belong to the same biological type.
Generally, the theory has to respect both mutations
caused by environmental eﬀects and spontaneous muta-
tions. For the sake of simplicity, we will consider no
other than the spontaneous mutations. The spontaneous
mutations are mainly due to transcription mistakes in
the replication of the DNA, i.e.
in the transmission of
the genetic information just at the reproduction events.
Let µ > 0 be the probability of the occurrence of such
a mutation. In the case of soil bacteria, biologists have
estimated the values of µ between 10−8 and 10−5. If a
mother bacterium is the carrier of the phenotypic value
p, the daughter bacterium will carry the same value p
µ. (We assume that
with the probability equal to 1
a new-born daughter bacterium grows quickly enough to
the adult size before becoming mature so that we need
not distinguish between the size of young and adult bac-
teria.) If the birth of the daughter bacterium is accom-
panied with a mutation of the DNA, then there is a non-
zero probability M (q
p)dq for the possibility that the
phenotypic value q of the daughter bacterium may lie
in the interval (q, q + dq), provided that the phenotypic
value of the mother bacterium was equal to p. Following
Waxman, we take the function M (p) as a Gaussian,

−

Now, to formulate the evolution equation of the pop-
ulation genetics, we have to introduce the average gen-
eration time τ . Simplifying the problem, we may con-
sider a discrete time variable as follows. Let the births of
the bacteria happen at the time instants tn = (n
1)τ ,
n = 1, 2, . . . Then we may say that the bacteria of the
nth generation live between tn−1 and tn. Thus, n is the
generation index. The time discretization is an auxiliary,
rather formal, mathematical trick which loses its signiﬁ-
cance if the time t is continualized. For each n, we deﬁne
the distribution function Φn(p) so that Φn(p)dp may be
interpreted as the probability of the occurrence of the
phenotypic value p in the interval (p, p + dp) in the nth
generation. The basic problem is to relate the distribu-
tion function of the generation number n + 1 (‘generation
of daughters’) with the distribution function of the gen-
eration number n (‘generation of mothers’).

Before writing the recurrent formula between the func-
tions Φn+1(p) and Φn(p), which is our primary goal in

3

this section, we have still to mention one important point.
Even if we have neglected the environmental inﬂuence
upon the mutations, we do have to consider environmen-
tal eﬀects in a Darwinian sense. Namely, we have to re-
spect that not all bacteria, after their birth, are equally ﬁt
to survive over the whole generation time τ . Only those
bacteria whose age is equal to τ give birth to oﬀspring.
Some of the bacteria die before becoming mature. These
bacteria do not take part in producing the individuals of
the next generation. (However, we assume that even the
ﬁttest mother bacterium dies soon after giving birth to
the daughter bacterium. Therefore, we do not include
the mother bacteria in the number of the bacteria liv-
ing in the time interval (tn, tn+1). The mother bacteria
have been included in the number of the bacteria living
in the time interval (tn−1, tn).) The ﬁtness of the bacte-
ria to live in their environment until their maturity can
be modeled by a non-negative function w(p). Requiring
that

0 < w(p) < 1 ,

(8)

we may give the function w(p) a probabilistic meaning.
We assume that a new-born carrier of the phenotypic
value p has the chance to live until the maturity with
the probability w(p). The number of mature carriers
of the phenotypic value p from the interval (p, p + dp)
in the nth generation is proportional to w(p)Φn(p). To
determine the shape of the function w(p) should be a
matter of thorough biological investigations from case to
case. We suppose, as Waxman and Peck did, that w(p)
behaves analytically around the value p0 = 0 and that
this value corresponds to the maximum value of w(p).
(Apparently, the ﬁttest bacterial individuals are those
whose phenotypic parameter p is equal to the average
value ¯p. However, ¯p = 0.)

Waxman and Peck have chosen the function w(p) in

w(p) = w(0) exp(

γp2) , 0 < w(0) < 1 ,

deﬁnes the Waxman-Peck model. The value of w(0) is
insigniﬁcant since the distribution functions Φn(p) are
independent of w(0).)

There are, of course, many other possibilities to model
w(p) by slowly varying functions with the maximum at
p0 = 0. These functions need not tend to zero if

(The ﬁtness function has been deﬁned as a probability,
not as a probability density!) In order to illustrate how
the theory may depend on the choice of the function w(p),
we will treat, in addition to the Waxman-Peck model,
also an alternative model. Our model (considered as an
example) is deﬁned by the ﬁtness function

The distribution function Φn+1(p) of the generation
of daughters is determined by two contributions from
the generation of mothers. The ﬁrst stems from the
births without mutations. The phenotypic value p is un-
changed at such births and the probability of the occur-
µ. The ﬁrst contri-
rence of such births is equal to 1

bution to Φn+1(p) is proportional to (1
The second contribution to Φn+1(p) is proportional to
q; σm)w(q)Φn(q). The interpretation
µ
of this expression is clear:
if the birth of the carrier
of the phenotypic value p is accompanied with a mu-
tation, we have to consider mature individuals, allow-
ing all possible phenotypic values q of potential mothers.
To exhaust all such possibilities, we have to integrate
q; σm)w(q)Φn(q) with respect to q. Since both
M (p

The denominator in the r.h. side of equation (10) war-
rants the fulﬁllment of condition (9). Since γ is small,
it is convenient to introduce the complementary function
c(p) to w(p)/w(0):

From the viewpoint of biology, the smallness of γ implies
that the comparison of the survival ﬁtness of the major-
ity of the bacteria with the survival ﬁtness of the ﬁttest
bacteria should not reveal too conspicuous diﬀerences.

With realistic values of p around p0 = 0, the values of

model, the values of c(p) are also small and

We may take advantage of the possibility to neglect all
terms of the order of magnitude of γ2, as well as of γµ.

Now, in the approximation neglecting the terms sym-

formalism employing the continual time variable t, real-

high. Typically, the generation time τ of soil bacteria is
about 20 minutes. This means that after elapsing hun-

dred days, the genetic information passes over more than
seven thousand generations of the bacteria. If n

It remains still to discuss the initial condition. Whichever
initial function

Φ(p, 0) = Φ0(p)

(19)

is chosen, the solution Φ(p, t) for t > 0 of equation (13)
is unique. Since equation (15) is linear, we may mul-
tiply ϕ(p, t) by an arbitrary constant A. If ϕ(p, t) gives
the function Φ(p, t) then Aϕ(p, t) does also give the same
function Φ(p, t). Therefore, we may choose the integral
∞
−∞ dq ϕ(q, 0) (which is a constant) equal to unity. Then
formula (14) and equality (19) give us the initial condi-
R
tion

ϕ(p, 0) = Φ0(p)

(20)

for the function ϕ(p, t).

If Φ0(p) is an even function, equation (15) implies that
the function ϕ(p, t) is also even in the variable p and
Φ(
p, t) = Φ(p, t) at all times t > 0. In this case, the

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

−

≪

w(p)/w(0)

In the present paper, we have focused attention on
the importance of the ﬁtness function w(p) in the theory
of the population genetics. Assuming that 0 < c(p) =
1, we have essentially followed Waxman
1
and Peck who derived the distribution function Φ(p, t)
of the population genetics as a functional of a function
ϕ(p, t) (cf. expression (14)) satisfying a linear integro-
equation (15)). However, in
diﬀerential equation (cf.
contrast with paper [12] where c(p) was approximated as
γp2 with some small parameter γ > 0, we emphasize that
c(p) may be chosen from a wider class of functions. In
particular, we have dealt with the model deﬁned by the
function c(p) = γ[1

ap2)].

exp(

We have calculated the distribution function as a series
with respect to the mutation probability µ. Our iteration
scheme for calculating the Green function G(p, t; p0) of
the equation for ϕ(p, t) has been used in the same manner
as in the density-matrix theory.

With adequately chosen function E(p), this equation
may concern conduction electrons in a homogeneous non-
degenerate semiconductor. (Since E(p) is not equal to
the kinetic energy of an electron in vacuum, we may in-
terpret the conduction electrons as quasiparticles deﬁned
by the dispersion law E = E(p).)

Our second remark concerns the analogy with the dif-
fusion theory. The Fourier transform of the function
G(p, t; p0) (multiplied by a constant) can be interpreted
as the concentration C(x, t; x0) of diﬀusants which all
were initially, at the time t0 = 0, localized in the point
x0. In the approximation of the present paper, we may
generally write the equation

If c(p) = γp2, the concentration C(x, t; x0) obeys the
usual diﬀusion equation with the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D =

In
any case, the positiveness of the ‘potential-energy term’
means that equation (47) involves a creation of diﬀusants.

Brownian motion.

But then a natural question arises: which stochastic

deﬁned by the stochastic equation ˙x(u) = [(2D0)1/2 +

by Laskin [20] in a theory of the channeling of high-
energy particles in crystals. (The channeling occurs when
a ray of equi-energy particles bombarding a crystal is col-
limated very precisely in a favorable direction.)

In the framework of the diﬀusion theory, we may con-
clude that the parameter γ of the theory of the popula-
tion genetics corresponds to an environmental noise. If
γ = 0, the noise is absent.

Section IV of the present paper has been devoted to
the problem of the evolution of a population in which
all individuals are initially equal, being the carriers of
the phenotypic value p0 = 0. The distribution function
Φ(p, t; 0) of the population is a sum of a sharp delta-
function component, N (t)δ(p), and a blurred component.
Similarly as in the thermodynamics, we may distinguish
two phases in the population at any time t > 0. Let
us denote them as phase S and phase B. The phase S
consist of the carriers of the initial phenotypic value p0 =
0. The phase B consists of the individuals carrying the
phenotypic values p
= p0. In the Waxman-Peck model
(cf. expressions (43a) and (44a)), the probability N (t)
tends to zero if t
. Therefore, we may say that the
phase S dissolves gradually in the phase B. In the model
with the ﬁtness function w(p) deﬁned by expression (8b)
(or by another similar expression), the probability N (t)
does not tend asymptotically to zero: this model predicts
that both the phases S and B may coexist if t

Abstract

On the study of protein folding, our understanding about the protein structures is limited.
In this paper we ﬁnd one way to characterize the compact structures of lattice protein model.
A quantity called Partnum is given to each compact structure. The Partnum is compared
with the concept Designability of protein structures emerged recently. It is shown that the
highly designable structures have, on average, an atypical number of local degree of freedom.
The statistical property of Partnum and its dependence on sequence length is also studied.

1 Introduction

The study of protein folding is fundamental on both theory and application. In order to tackle
protein folding problem physically, it is important to pay much attention to concrete proteins
and consider the details of interactions, such as for medical purpose. But there are also “global
views” that should be noticed. For example, The possible conﬁgurations of folded proteins are
enormous, while that can be observed in living form is rather limited. These protein structures
generally can be described as belonging to a limit number of families. In each family, ignoring
the details, the proteins possess similar overall conformations, and in many cases the structures
show regular forms or approximate symmetry.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Another example is that single
domain proteins was observed only within a certain range of sequence length: the number of
amino acid residues in single domain proteins seldom exceeds 200. Larger proteins usually fold
into multi-domains native states.[6]

With the accumulation of knowledge about the structures and functions of proteins, it was
found that many proteins of similar structures pursue complete diﬀerent functions, while pro-
teins with diﬀerent tertiary structures may perform similar functions. These suggested that to

understand the protein folding problem physically, one should ﬁrst get to know the properties
of protein structures.[7] Based on the the concepts from the physics of spin glass, study shows
that to fold eﬃciently, proteins require a specially shaped energy landscape resembling a fun-
nel. A heteropolymer with a completely random sequence generically possess a rugged energy
landscape without a funnel.[8, 9] Goldstein et al[10, 11] have worked on optimizing energy func-
tions for protein structure prediction. They found that some structures are more optimizable
than others, i.e., there exist structures for which the funneled energy landscape can be obtained
within a wide range of interaction parameters, while for some other structures the parameters
for fast folding are much more restricted. The funneled landscape theory argued that the inter-
actions in the folded structure must act in concert more eﬀectively than expected in the most
random cases.[12] Accordingly, compared with most other structures, the superiority of highly
optimizable structure should be that its geometric arrangement permit more sequences to reach
the concert interaction states.

Other studies on the thermodynamic of lattice protein models also support the above idea.[13,
14, 15, 16] In the lattice HP models, a protein is represented by a self avoiding chain of beads
placed on a discrete lattice with two types of beads: the Polar (P) and the Hydrophobic (H).
A sequence is speciﬁed by a choice of monomer type at each position on the chain {xi}. Where
xi could be either H- or P-type, and i is a monomer index. A structure is speciﬁed by a set of
coordinates for all the monomers {ri}. The energy has the form:

H = X
i<j

Exixj △(ri − rj)

where △(ri − rj) = 1 when ri and rj are adjoining lattice sites while they are not adjacent along
the sequence, and △(ri − rj) = 0 in other cases. Interaction parameter Exixj diﬀer according
to the contact type HH, HP, or PP. Given the interaction parameters, it is possible to ﬁnd out
the ground state structure(s) of each sequence. Study shows that structures diﬀer markedly
in their tendency to be chosen by sequences as their unique ground states. The number of
sequences which choice the structure as unique ground state is called the Designability of
this structure.
It was argued that only highly designable structures are thermodynamically
stable and stable against mutation, and thus can be chosen by nature to fulﬁll the duty of
life.[13] Though interaction parameters used may diﬀer strongly in diﬀerent studies, the mostly
designed structures do not depend strongly on the detail of interactions.[13, 15, 16]

From above discussion we see that it should be essential to investigate the protein folding
problem from structural point of view. To see the problem more clearly, we take square lattice
HP model as an example. The total number of the most compact structures of 36 beads chain
is 57337.[14] Consider 36 beads homopolymer with interaction parameter Exixj = E0 < 0. All
the 57337 structures give the same energy when one such homopolymer fold onto each of them.
Therefore the folded energy can not be used to distinguish the compact structures from each
other. The essential here is that of discrimination, or characterization: give ways to tell how
and why structures diﬀer from each other. Nature’s way to break the symmetry is to replace
homopolymer with heteropolymer. From this point of view, the success of lattice protein model

2

is that it help to reveal this secret of nature.

Studies focusing on the properties of protein structures is still lack,[17] in spite of some
recent elaborations in this direction.[18, 19, 20] In this article we present one way to break the
symmetry, to distinguish the compact structures of lattice model without explicitly considering
concrete interaction form. However, since only compact structures are considered here, an
loose constraint is actually set on interactions:
interactions under which compact structures
are preferred as ground energy states. The method gives a number called partition number
(Partnum) to each compact structure during a simple process. The Partnums of structures
diﬀer strongly, so giving one way to distinguish them from each other.

In the following section we will give the detail of the method, and compare the Partnum
with designability. The statistical properties of Partnums are discussed in section II. The last
section is for some remarks.

2 The deﬁnition and interpretation of Partnum

It is easy to ﬁnd out all the compact structures of certain chain length with computer.[21] Take
9 beads chain as an example. The search is self avoiding and restricted to the 3×3 square lattice
shown in Fig.1(A), and the resulting structures should not be related by rotation or reﬂection
symmetry. As a result, there are only three starting points, (0, 0), (0, 1) and (1, 1), for the search
of structures. To ﬁnd the structures start at (0, 0), the ﬁrst step is to go to (1, 0). This is the
only choice, because (0, 1) is a symmetric point of (1, 0). We give all the structures following
this step a number p1 = ln(1). Now go to the next site. There are two possible choices: (2, 0) or
(1, 1). Since the walk is self avoiding and restricted to the 3×3 lattices, the walk following certain
choice may fail to extend to 9 beads length. The choice that will reach to 9 beads length is called
acceptable. Suppose that both (2, 0) and (1, 1) are acceptable. Then each compact structure
which will be generated following (0, 0) −→ (1, 0) −→ (2, 0) or (0, 0) −→ (1, 0) −→ (1, 1) is
given a number ln(1/2). Generally speaking, restricting to 3 × 3 lattice and beginning at a
starting point, there are totally 8 steps to ﬁnish a self avoiding walk. Each step is given one
number according to the following rule:
if the i-th step has totally C acceptable choices not
being symmetrically related, then the step is given a number called partnum of i-th step
pi = ln(1/C). For 2D square lattice, the largest possible choice C0 is 3.

Adding all the 8 numbers and then dividing the sum by 8, we get the Partnum P 1. Here the
structure is actually oriented . The consideration of oriented walk is reasonable in the case of
protein structures, because the native protein structure would become unstable if the sequence
is reversed, and also protein in life are produced successively from one end to another. However,
if one consider the start and end reversal of the walk as a symmetric operation, then one oriented
walk and its reverse together correspond to a structure that is not related with the direction. In
the follows, oriented walk and non-oriented structures are used to distinguish the two diﬀerent
ways of viewing structure, and the Partnums corresponding to them are denoted as P 1 and
P 2, respectively. However, when it is no need to distinguish them, simply structure is used and
the Partnum is denoted as P . For the non-oriented structure, the Partnum can be deﬁne as:

3

P 2 = P 1(1) + P 1(2), where P 1(1) is the Partnum of one of two oriented walks and P 1(2) is
that of its reverse.

The Partnums of structures of other chain length can be obtained similarly.
Since the original motivation of developing the Partnums of structures is to account for the
diﬀerence of Designability of structures, in Fig.2 we give the plot of Designability against Part-
num of orientd structures on 5×5 lattice (the interaction parameters for calculating Designability
is the same as used in Ref. [13]). There is not strict correspondence between Designability and
Partnum. However the linear ﬁt of the data revealed that Designability tends to increase with
the increase of Partnum (see Fig.2). The same thing happens for other sequence length. In the
case of 6 × 6 lattice, the structure with highest Designability[13, 15] possess the second largest
Partnum (P 2).

According to Fig.1(B), an oriented walk corresponds to one path from the root to the top
leave of the hierarchical tree. The value of Partnum of the structure is determined by the
frequency of the path being disturbed by branches.
If the path of a walk meet with fewer
branches, the Partnum would be larger. This can be compared with the conclusion in Ref. [16].
In Ref. [16] a simple version of HP model of protein is employed. A walk is reduced to a string of
0s and 1s, which represent the surface and core site respectively, as the backbone is traced. Each
walk is therefore associated with a point in a high dimensional space. Sequences are represented
by strings of their hydrophobicity and thus can be mapped into the same space. It was found
that walks far away from other walks in the high dimensional space are highly designable and
thermodynamically stable. For this reason, highly designable structures are called atypical in
Ref. [16]. Here the structures with large Partnum can also be called atypical (atypical average
local freedom) since these structures correspond to paths on the hierarchical tree with fewer
branches.

In an analog to the suggestion that nature selected out only highly designable structures, we
assume that there exists a random process which selects out only the structures with the largest
Partnum. It is interesting to see what this assumption will result in.

For concise we assume a critical Partnum Pc, so that only a small portion of oriented walks
for which P 1 > Pc can be selected out. Two oriented walks are called n-level similar if their ﬁrst
n − 1 steps are along the same path, and they branched at the n-th steps. Suppose s1 is among
the structures with the most highest Partnum satisfying P 1(s1) > Pc. This means that there
are few branches along the path of s1. As a result, it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd walks which show high
level similarity to s1. But if there do exist such walks, these walks should have high possibility
to be selected out. For example, if s2 is N − 1 level similar with s1, N being the chain length,
then P 1(s2) = P 1(s1) > Pc. More generally, let n12 being the similarity level between s2 and s1.
We know that P 1(s2) = P 1(s1) − (1 − n12
N −1 ln(C0)), C0 = 3 being the maximal possible choices
per step during the search of structures. According to this expression, the more similar s2 is to
s1, the more possible it is to be selected out.

Assuming that s3 is another walks with P 1(s3) > Pc, but it is dissimilar to s1. From above
discussion we know that there are two families, all the members of which are selected out. Within
each family, the similarity level of two walks is much higher than n13, while any two walks from

4

diﬀerent families are dissimilar from each other, and the similarity level is n13. We thus come
to the conclusion that the selected walks belong to separate families. walks within each family
are similar, while walks belonging to diﬀerent families are dissimilar.

For the non-oriented structures, there is no the convenience of the hierarchical tree to discuss
their properties. But it is believable that the above result be kept once similarity between
structures is properly deﬁned. This is the case for the classiﬁcation of real protein structures,
where more or less arbitrary criteria[1, 2, 3, 22, 23, 24, 25] are used to deﬁne the similarity
between protein structures and to classify structure into families, superfamilies , folds, and so
on.

3 The statistical properties of Partnums

Natural single domain proteins exist only within a limit range of sequence length. By both
theoretical and numerical studies it is showed in Ref. [26] that the stability of folded sequences
against mutation decrease with the increase of chain length. In that follows the dependence of
the statistical properties of Partnum on chain length will be discussed. We will show how some
structural properties are determined by general statistical principle.

The density distribution of P 2 are shown in Fig.4. Things are similar for P 1.

In both
cases, visually the distribution becomes more and more normal. Actually it will be shown that
the distribution is Gauss distribution in the long chain limit. As the ﬁrst step, however, let’s
much generally, assume that the Partnums of chain length N can be described by a density
distribution function, F (P, v1, v2...), vi being the moment of i-th orders. It is easy to get the
average v1 =< P > and variance v2 = △P . The results of both oriented walk and non-oriented
structures are shown in Fig.3.

Fig.3 shows that < P > (both < P 1 > and < P 2 >) decrease with the increase of chain
length. However, from the deﬁnition of Partnum we know that < P 1 > (< P 2 >) can not be
smaller than −ln3 (−2ln3). So, for either oriented walks or non-oriented structures, there must
exist δ, so that

A similar argument applies to △P , where

limN −→∞ < P >= δ.

limN −→∞△P = ǫ, ǫ ≥ 0.

It is known that the total number of compact structures M increase exponentially with the
increase of chain length N : M (N )∼(Cav)N , Cav < C0 = 3 being the average number possible
choices per step for the walks. This gives one way to estimate the value of Cav using the
knowledge of M (N ). Fig.5 show the ﬁt of the data M (N ) to f (N ) = (lnCav)N + b. The
result is Cav = 1.397. Viewing this value of Cav as the value in long chain limit, we get that
δ = ln(1/Cav) = −0.3343 for oriented walks, a reasonable estimation (see Fig.3).
It should
be noticed that Cav get this way is much larger that given by mean ﬁeld consideration,[21, 27]
where Cav = C0/e = 1.1. According to this Cav, δ = −0.099 for non-oriented walks. From Fig.3

5

we know that this is a value too large to be the long chain limit of < P 1 >. So it seems that
the mean ﬁeld treatment does not apply to the two dimensional protein model.

With the help of central limit theorem, we can argue that the density distribution is Gauss

distribution in long chain limit, and ǫ = 0. See follows.

In the space of compact structures, the Partnum P of certain structure is the average of
the partnums pi of all the T steps. For oriented walks T equals to the chain length subtracted
by 1, and for non-oriented structures this value should be doubled further. Now divide the T
partnums into (T )/n groups (suppose T /n is an integer).
In each group the n members are
chosen randomly within the total T numbers. For each group we deﬁne a new random variable
qk = Pi pi/n, k being the group index. Since the members in each group are chosen randomly
form the total T numbers, the T /n newly deﬁned random variable should have the same average
and variance when n −→ ∞. At the same time, since P = Pk
(T −1)/n , applying the central limit
theorem,[28] we know that P is a Gaussian random variable, and δP −→ 0 when T /n −→ ∞.

qk

From the above discussion we know that, according to Partnums, statistically all the compact
structures become indistinguishable in long chain limit. Recalling the selection rule assumed
above, we know that it becomes increasingly diﬃcult to select out atypical structures when chain
length increases. These results show some connection to the work of Ejtihadi et al..[20] With a
purely geometrical approach, they were able to reduce largely the candidates of structures that
can be chosen as the ground states of sequences. They found that for the case of HP protein
model the number of ground state candidates grows only as N 2, N being the sequence length.
While, as pointed out above, the total number of compact structures increase exponentially with
the increase of N . So it becomes increasingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd the ground state candidates. This
is in accordance with the statistical property of Partnum.

For fulﬁlling biology functions, proteins should possess some properties, for example fast
folding, thermodynamically stable and stable against mutation.[12, 13, 26, 29, 30] It was pos-
tulated that with the increase of sequence length, the folded structures become more and more
diﬃcult to possess these properties.[26] Based on the study of Partnum, we propose that this
property of proteins is determined by the statistical properties of protein structures, the detail
of interaction having weak inﬂuence.

4 Conclusion Remarks

Protein structures seem to be a very special class among all the possible folded conﬁgurations of
polypeptide chain. We now know something about how special it is, but little on why it be so.
Ways of characterizing folded structures, from whatever point of view, will help to deepen our
understanding about protein structures. In this paper, the study on Partnum itself is interesting,
and more interesting when compared with the dynamic and thermodynamic study of proteins.
The concept of Partnum is simple and can only be applied to lattice model. But the study on it
reveals that it is possible to investigate protein structures with no consideration of interaction
detail.

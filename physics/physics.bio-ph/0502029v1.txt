The vibron dynamics associated to amide-I vibrations in a 3D α-helix protein is described accord-
ing to a generalized Davydov model. The protein is modeled by three spines of hydrogen-bonded
peptide units linked via covalent bonds. To remove the vibron-phonon coupling, a Lang-Firsov
transformation is performed and a mean ﬁeld procedure is applied to reach the dressed vibron point
of view. It is shown that the vibron dynamics results from the competition between inter-spine and
intra-spine vibron hops and that the two kinds of hopping processes do not experience the same
dressing mechanism. Therefore, at low temperature (or weak vibron-phonon coupling), the polaron
behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized over all the spines whereas at biological temperature (or
strong vibron-phonon coupling), the dressing eﬀect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges be-
tween diﬀerent spines. As a result the polaron propagates along a single spine as in the 1D Davydov
model. Although the helix supports both acoustical and optical phonons, this feature originates in
the coupling between the vibrons and the acoustical phonons, only. Finally, the lattice distortion
which accompanies the polaron has been determined and it is shown that residues located on the
excited spine are subjected to a stronger deformation than the other residues.

INTRODUCTION

In living systems, the energy released by the hydroly-
sis of adenosine triphophate (ATP) is a universal energy
source allowing many biological processes such as muscle
contraction, active transport or enzyme catalysis. How-
ever, the fundamental question arises whether this energy
can be transported from the active sites of the living cell
to other regions without being dispersed or dissipated.

This question was ﬁrst pointed out by Davydov and
co-workers in the 70th to explain the energy transport in
α-helix proteins [1, 2]. The main idea is that the released
energy, partially stored in the high-frequency amide-I vi-
bration of a peptide group, can be transported from one
end of the protein to the other. The dipole-dipole cou-
pling between the diﬀerent peptide groups leads to the
delocalization of the internal vibrations and to the for-
mation of vibrons. However, the interaction between the
vibrons and the phonons of the protein induces a nonlin-
ear dynamics which counterbalances the dispersion and
yields the creation of the so-called Davydov soliton (for
a recent review, see for instance Refs. [3, 4]).

Unfortunately, no clear evidence has yet been found for
the existence of solitons in real proteins and it has been
suggested by Brown and co-workers [5, 6] and by Ivic and
co-workers [7, 8, 9] that the solution is rather a small po-
laron than a soliton. Indeed, this problem exhibits two
asymptotic solutions depending on the values taken by
three relevant parameters, i.e. the vibron bandwidth, the
phonon cutoﬀ frequency and the strength of the vibron
phonon coupling. When the vibron bandwidth is greater

∗Electronic address: vincent.pouthier@univ-fcomte.fr

than the phonon cutoﬀ frequency, the adiabatic limit is
reached so that the phonons behave in a classical way
and create a quasistatic potential well responsible for the
trapping of the vibron according to the Davydov soliton.
By contrast, when the vibron bandwidth is lesser than
the phonon cutoﬀ frequency, the situation corresponds to
the non-adiabatic limit in which the quantum behavior of
the phonons plays a crucial role. A vibron is thus dressed
by a virtual cloud of phonons which yields a lattice distor-
tion essentially located on a single site and which follows
instantaneously the vibron. The vibron dressed by the
lattice distortion forms the small polaron and, as men-
tioned by the authors, this situation corresponds to pro-
tein dynamics. Recently, the polaron approach has been
improved to characterize the two-polaron energy spec-
trum with a special emphasis onto the interplay between
the dressing eﬀect and the intramolecular anharmonic-
ity of each amide-I vibration [10, 11]. Both features
favor the formation of two-polaron bound states and it
has been shown that the protein supports two kinds of
bound states referring to the trapping of two polarons
onto the same amide-I mode and onto two nearest neigh-
bor amide-I vibrations. These results were corroborated
by a recent experiment devoted to the femtosecond in-
frared pump-probe spectroscopy of the N-H mode in a
stable α-helix which has revealed the two excited state
absorption bands connected to the two kinds of bound
states [12, 13]. Vibrational self-trapping in model pro-
tein was thus observed for the ﬁrst time, validating in
the same time the polaron approach.

However, most of the theoretical studies applied to the
Davydov problem involve a 1D approximation of the 3D
structure of the α-helix protein. Although a real helix is
formed by three spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units
connected through covalent bonds, such an assumption
was motivated by the fact that when a vibron is symmet-

rically excited over the three spines, the vibron-phonon
dynamics reduces to that of a single hydrogen bonded
chain [3, 14, 15, 16]. However, it has been shown within
the soliton approach, that when a vibron is excited on a
single spine the 3D nature of the protein manifests itself
by reducing the soliton velocity and by favoring the ex-
changes between spines [14, 15, 16]. Recently, a detailed
analysis of both the soliton trapping and the soliton dy-
namics in a 3D α-helix protein has been done by Hennig
[17]. It has been shown that the soliton envelop exhibits
a monotonic decay but shows a multihump structure. In
addition, the lattice distortion along hydrogen bonds is
reduced for the 3D model when compared with the 1D
model, and, in the excited region, the radius of the helix
decreases. From a dynamical point of view, Hennig has
recovered the soliton velocity decrease and he has shown
that the preferred transport pathway takes place along
the hydrogen bonds.

In this paper, the small polaron formalism is applied
to a 3D model of an α-helix protein with a special em-
phasis onto the modiﬁcation of the dressing mechanism
induced by the 3D nature of the phonons of the helix.
Note that we restrict our attention to the characteriza-
tion of the single-polaron energy spectrum and the gen-
eralization to two-polaron eigenstates will be introduced
in a forthcoming work.

The paper is organized as follows. The model to de-
scribe the vibron-phonon dynamics in 3D α-helix pro-
teins is introduced in Sec. II. In Sec. III, the nature of
the phonons in the helix is ﬁrst summarized. Then, a
Lang-Firsov [18] transformation is applied to renormal-
ize the vibron-phonon interaction and to reach the small
polaron point of view. Finally, a mean ﬁeld procedure is
performed to obtain the eﬀective dressed vibron Hamil-
tonian. In Sec. IV, a numerical analysis of the vibron-
phonon dynamics is performed depending on the values
of the relevant parameters of the problem. Finally, the
results are discussed and interpreted in Sec. V.

bonded peptide units. (b) Top view of the helix backbone
where a particular local frame is displayed.

Let us consider a sequence of N amino acid units
(called residues) regularly distributed along a polypep-
tide chain. Let n the index which labels the position
of the nth residue along the chain. In three dimension,
the structure of the polypeptide chain is stabilized by
the hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl oxygen (CO)
of residue n and the amide hydrogen (NH) of residue
n + 3. The resulting conformation is a 3D α-helix in
which each residue is related to the next one by a trans-
lation of h = 1.5 ˚A and by a rotation of θ0 = 100o leading
to 3.6 residues per turn of helix (see Fig. 1a). The pitch
of the helix, i.e. the product of the translation (1.5 ˚A)
by the number of residues per turn (3.6), is equal to 5.4
˚A. The radius of the helix, which corresponds to the dis-
tribution of the center of mass of the residues, is ﬁxed to

R0 = 2.8 ˚A [2].

To model the vibron-phonon dynamics in a rather sim-
ple way, we follow the procedure introduced by Hennig
[17] and treat the N residues as point-like entities which
the equilibrium positions are located on sites distributed
along the helix. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1a, the
geometry of the helix is speciﬁed in the (xyz) cartesian
frame where the z direction is parallel to the axis of the
helix. The equilibrium position of the nth residue is thus
expressed as

R(n) = R0 cos nθ0ex + R0 sin nθ0ey + nhez

(1)

where eα denotes the unit vector parallel to the direction
α = x, y, z.

The nth site contains a amide-I vibration which be-
haves as an internal high frequency oscillator described
by the standard creation and annihilation vibron opera-
tors b+

as

The amide-I vibrations interact with the phonons of
the helix associated to the collective dynamics of the ex-
ternal motions of the peptide groups. As mentioned by
Hennig [17], both the covalent and the hydrogen bonds
are assumed to be represented by point-point interac-
tions. The coupling between two residues is thus de-
scribed by a pair potential V [r(nn′)] which depends on
the instantaneous distance r(nn′) =
be-
tween the two residues n and n′. Within the harmonic
approximation, each peptide group performs small dis-
placements u(n) around its equilibrium position R(n) so
that the instantaneous position r(n) of the nth residue
can be expressed as r(n) = R(n) + u(n). Therefore, by
expanding the intermolecular potential around the equi-
librium helix conformation, the phonon Hamiltonian is
written as

where p(n) is the momentum associated to the displace-

the representation of the vectors in the cartesian frame
(x, y, z). In Eq.(3), Φ(nn′) is the force constant tensor
deﬁned as the second derivative of the potential at equi-
librium and written as

Φαβ(nn′) =

∂2V [r(nn′)]
∂uα(n)∂uβ(n′)

(4)

According to the Davydov model, the vibron-phonon
interaction originates in the modulation of the vibra-
tional frequency of each amide-I vibration by the exter-
nal motion of the residues. This coupling is expressed in
terms of the instantaneous positions r(n) of the residues
as

can be expanded around the equilibrium position of the
residues so that the resulting coupling Hamiltonian is ﬁ-

Finally, the vibron-phonon dynamics is described by
the full Hamiltonian H = Hv +Hp +∆Hvp which appears
as a generalization of the well-known Davydov Hamilto-
nian to a 3D α-helix protein.

III. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

In proteins, the vibron-phonon interaction is assumed
to be strong enough so that the vibron dynamics is es-
sentially governed by the so-called dressing eﬀect. The
characterization of this eﬀect requires the knowledge of
the phonon eigenstates and of the Lang-Firsov transfor-
mation [18] which yields the small polaron point of view.
However, although these two features are well known in
an inﬁnite lattice with translational invariance, the heli-
cal nature of the protein is responsible for a modiﬁcation
of both the phonon structure and the dressing mecha-
nism. The present section is thus devoted to the presen-
tation of these modiﬁcations.

A. Phonons in a 3D α-helix protein

In a recent paper devoted to solitons in proteins, Chris-
tiansen et al. have introduced a general formalism to
characterize the phonon dynamics [19] in an α-helix. This
formalism consists in expressing the residue dynamics in
a simple way by taking advantage of the invariance of the
phonon Hamiltonian according to a rotation by an angle
of θ0 around the helix axis followed by a translation along
this axis by a distance h.

To proceed,

it is more convenient to express the
position of the residues in a set of N local
frames
(er(n), eθ(n), ez(n)) attached to each residue (see Fig.
1b). The unit vectors of the nth local frame are ex-
pressed in terms of the unit vectors of the cartesian frame
(ex, ey, ez) as

eµ(n) = Tµα(n)eα

where µ = r, θ, z and α = x, y, z and where T (n) is the
local (3

×

T (n) = 



In that context, let v(n) denotes the displacement of
the nth residue expressed in the nth local frame. This

(7)

vector is deﬁned in terms of its cartesian counterpart
u(n) as v(n) = T (n)u(n). Therefore, by applying this
latter transformation, the phonon Hamiltonian Eq.(3) is
rewritten as

where ∆kσ accounts for the modulation of the frequency
of the nth amide-I vibration due to its coupling with
the phonon mode speciﬁed by the wave vector k and the
index σ. It is deﬁned as

By using Eq.(17), the transformed Hamiltonian ˆH =
U HU † is written as

where pµ(n) denotes the momentum connected to vµ(n)
and where Ψ(nn′) = T (n)Φ(nn′)T −1(n′).

At this step, it is straightforward to show that the
transformed force constant tensor Ψ(nn′) depends only
n′ (see Appendix A). As a

consequence, the Bloch theorem can be applied so that
the displacement of the nth residue in the nth local frame
can be expanded as a superimposition of plane waves as

vµ(n) =

(10)

where k denotes a reduced wave vector which belongs to

where p(k) is the momentum associated to v(k). Note
that the expression of the Dynamical matrix is detailed
in Appendix A.

Finally, the normal mode decomposition is achieved by
performing the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix
D(k) for each k value. Such a procedure allows us to
deﬁne three eigenvalues Ω2
kσ and three eigenvectors ǫkσ
labeled by the index σ = 1, 2, 3. Therefore, the two in-
dexes k and σ specify a particular phonon mode with
energy ~Ωkσ, quasi-momentum ~k and polarization ǫkσ.
The quantum dynamics of each mode is described by the
well-known creation a†
kσ and annihilation akσ operators
so that the phonon Hamiltonian can be rewritten in the
standard form as

Hp =

B. Small polaron theory and eﬀective Hamiltonian

To partially remove the vibron-phonon coupling
Hamiltonian, a Lang-Firsov transformation is applied
[18]. Indeed, since the vibron-phonon dynamics is domi-
nated by the so-called dressing eﬀect, we consider a ”full
dressing” and introduce the following unitary transfor-
mation

Note that since we restrict our attention to the single-
vibron dynamics, additional terms which involve the
product of four vibron operators have been disregarded
in the present version of the Hamiltonian Eq.(18). These
terms play a crucial role for the two-vibron dynamics
[10, 11] and will be addressed in a forthcoming work. In
Eq.(18), EB = ~ωB denotes the small polaron binding

(20)

In this dressed vibron point of view (Eq.(18)), the
vibron-phonon coupling remains through the modulation
of the lateral terms by the dressing operators. Although
these operators depend on the phonon coordinates in a
highly nonlinear way, the vibron-phonon interaction has
been strongly reduced within this transformation. As a

result, we can take advantage of such a reduction to per-
form a mean ﬁeld procedure [7, 8] and to express the full
Hamiltonian ˆH as the sum of three separated contribu-
tions as

The Hamiltonian ˆHef f (Eq.(22)) describes the dynam-
ics of vibrons dressed by a virtual cloud of phonons, i.e.
small polarons. A polaron state corresponds to a de-
localized plane wave with wave vector q and frequency
n≥1 Jef f (n) cos(qn). Eq.(22) accounts for
ωq = ˆω0 −
a renormalization of the main part of the vibron-phonon
coupling within the non-adiabatic limit. The remaining
vibron-phonon coupling is thus assumed to be small in
order to be treated using perturbative theory. Never-
theless, such a contribution is disregarded in the present
work.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, the previous formalism is applied to
characterize the single-vibron energy spectrum of a 3D
α-helix protein. However, the present theory involves a
set of parameters which has ﬁrst to be discussed.

From the literature, the parameters enter the vibron
dynamics in 3D α-helices are relatively well described .
The quantum energy for an amide-I vibration is about
1660 cm−1 so that the harmonic frequency is ﬁxed to
ω0 = 1695 cm−1. A well admitted value for the hop-
ping constant along the hydrogen bonds is J(3) = 7.8
cm−1 (see for instance Refs.
[3, 8]). In the same way,
the vibron hopping constants between diﬀerent spines of
hydrogen-bonded peptide units have been calculated in
12.4 cm−1 and J(2) = 3.9
Ref.
−
cm−1. Despite their small values, the other elements of

[20] so that J(1) =

5

the hopping matrix have been taken into account in the
present work and are listed in the Table I of Ref. [20]. Fi-
nally, the anharmonic constant of the amide-I vibration
is about A = 8.0 cm−1 [10, 21, 22].

The phonon dynamics is essentially governed by the
force constant tensor deﬁned in Eq.(4).
In that con-
text, we assume that the helical conformation of the pro-
tein corresponds to the equilibrium of each pair poten-
tial which connects two residues. Therefore, the force
constant tensor is expressed as

Φαβ(nn′) =

K|n−n′|

−

Rα(nn′)Rβ(nn′)
R2(nn′)

(24)

where K|n−n′| denotes the second derivative of the pair
potential connecting the two residues located onto the
sites n and n′. According to the 3D model of Hennig
[17], the α-helix exhibits two modes corresponding to a
longitudinal displacement along the helix axis and to a
radial displacement perpendicular to this axis. To re-
cover these results, the force constant K2 is set to zero
and we assume K|n| = 0 for n
4. The force constant K3
of the hydrogen bonds ranges between 13 and 20 Nm−1
[3, 8, 10, 11, 17] whereas the force constant K1 of the co-
valent bonds varies between 45 and 75 Nm−1 [17]. With
W/2, where W is the force constant
our notations, K1 ≈
for the radial motion introduced by Hennig. Finally, the
mass M which enters the phonon dynamics has been ﬁxed
to 2.0 10−25 kg.

The vibron-phonon coupling is basically deﬁned from
the knowledge of the parameters χ|n−n′| (Eq.(6)) which
accounts for the modulation of the nth amide-I frequency
due to the external motion of the n′th residue. Accord-
ing to the 1D Davydov model, the parameter χ3 ranges
between 35 and 62 pN. However, the inﬂuence of the mo-
tion of the residues n
2 onto the nth amide-I
1 and n
vibration is still unknown. Therefore, we choose χ2 = 0
whereas we treat χ1 as a parameter smaller than χ3 [17].

In Fig. 2, the phonon energy spectrum is shown for
K1 = 60 Nm−1, K3 = 15 Nm−1 (full line) and for
K1 = 75 Nm−1, K3 = 20 Nm−1 (dashed line). The
spectrum exhibits two non vanishing dispersion curves
whereas the third one is equal to zero in the entire Bril-
louin zone. The low frequency curve, which tends to zero
when k
0, corresponds to acoustical phonons, whereas
the high frequency curve represents optical phonons. In
the long-wavelength limit, the acoustic branch increases
linearly with the wave vector k and describes a sound
wave. However, the curve reaches a maximum value when
k = π/3 then it decreases to a minimum value when
k = 2π/3. Finally, the frequency increases again when
k reaches the edge of the Brillouin zone. Note that the
acoustic branch is rather insensitive to the force constant
K1 whereas it strongly depends on the force constant K3.
The maximum acoustic frequencies are equal to 89 and
102 cm−1 when K3 = 15 and 20 Nm−1, respectively,
whereas the minimum frequency in k = 2π/3 is about
20 cm−1. The optical branch appears almost constant

dispersion of about 8.5 cm−1.
It strongly depends on
the force constant K1 and appears almost insensitive to
K3. At the center of the Brillouin zone, the optical fre-
quency is equal to 135 cm−1 when K1 = 60 Nm−1 and
reaches 151 cm−1 when K1 = 75 Nm−1. Note that the
dotted line represents the phonon dispersion curve in the
corresponding 1D Davydov model for K3 = 15 Nm−1.

In the long-wavelength limit, the analysis of the eigen-
vectors of the dynamical matrix reveals that the acoustic
phonons are essentially polarized along the axis of the
helix. More precisely, they correspond to longitudinal
vibrations along the direction speciﬁed by the hydrogen
bonds. By contrast, the optical branch refers to a ra-
dial motion of the residues which describes a breathing
mode of the radius of the helix. These two features cor-
roborate the previous observed dependence of the two
branches with respect to the force constants K1 and K3.
Note that a singular behavior takes place when k = 2π/3
since the acoustic branch becomes polarized along the ra-
dial direction, only. In the same way, when k reaches the
edge of the Brillouin zone, the optical branch refers to an
hybridization between a radial and a torsional motion.

at k′(1) = 0.41, k′(2) = 1.71 and k′(3) = 2.48. When
χ1 = 25 pN and χ3 = 50 pN, the maxima lye around
23 cm−1 whereas they reach 28 cm−1 when χ1 = 10 pN
and χ3 = 60 pN. In fact, the coupling with acoustical
phonon depends signiﬁcantly on χ3 and appears almost
insensitive to χ1. Note that the coupling shows a local
minimum around k = 2π/3 which correspond to a zero

the coupling constant as S(n, T ) = Sa(n, T ) + So(n, T )
where Sa(n, T ) and So(n, T ) denote the contributions of
the coupling with acoustical and optical phonons, respec-
tively.

As illustrated in Fig. 4a, at low temperature, the cou-
pling constant Sa(n, T ) appears almost site independent
and slightly ﬂuctuates around 0.25. When the temper-
ature increases, the coupling constant increases and ex-
hibits two distinct behaviors depending on the nature of
the bond n which experiences the dressing eﬀect. Indeed,
when n = 3, 6, 9, ..., Sa(n, T ) accounts for the dressing
mechanism responsible for a decreases of the vibron hop-
ping constant between amide-I vibrations along the same
spine of hydrogen-bonded peptide units. The coupling
Sa(n, T ) increases almost linearly with n and leads to a
screening of the corresponding vibron hopping constants.
When n = 1, 2, 4, 5, ..., Sa(n, T ) characterizes the dress-
ing of the hopping constant between amide-I vibrations
located onto diﬀerent spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide
units. As previously, it increases as n increases. The
ﬁgure clearly shows that vibron hops between diﬀerent
spines experience a stronger dressing mechanism than the

7

hops which take place along the same spine. The diﬀer-
ence between the two kinds of dressing increases as the
temperature increases. However, as n increases, the two
kinds of dressing converge to the same n dependence. In
other words, long range vibron hops experience the same
dressing eﬀect whatever the location of the amide-I vi-
brations involved in the process.

As shown in Fig. 4b, the contribution of the opti-
cal phonons So(n, T ) is about two orders of magnitude
smaller than the contribution of acoustical phonons. It
exhibits a fully diﬀerent behavior with respect to the
bond index n since it drastically varies with n until n
4
and becomes almost n independent when n
5. Note
that as previously, the coupling constant So(n, T ) in-
creases with the temperature.

The angular distortion of the helix which corresponds to

Although the site n0 does not exhibit any torsion, os-
cillations in the deformation of the helix backbone take
place due to the diﬀerent kinds of bonds between the site
n0 and its neighboring sites. Nevertheless, after the dis-
tortion has been propagated over few residues, the ﬁgure
clearly shows that the residues located on the right side of
the excited site (n > n0) are characterized by an increase
of the θ angle around its equilibrium value. By contrast,
the opposite feature appears in the left side of the excited
site (n < n0) where the θ angle of each residue is basi-
cally reduced from its equilibrium value. As a result, a
kink-like soliton takes place which discriminates between
a negative torsion of about -0.12 degree and a positive
torsion of about +0.12 degree. Similar features are ob-
served for the deformation along the axis of the helix as

V. DISCUSSION

In the previous section, the numerical calculations have
clearly shown that the 3D nature of the α-helix pro-
tein strongly modiﬁes the small polaron eigenstates when
compared with the 1D Davydov model. However, the
origin of these modiﬁcations is twofold. First, the vibron
dynamics is diﬀerent because an helix protein allows for
vibron hops between diﬀerent spines of hydrogen-bonded
peptide units. Then, the protein supports both acousti-
cal and optical phonons which participate in a diﬀerent
way to the dressing eﬀect.

Nevertheless, to discuss and interpret these observed
features, let us ﬁrst mention some general remarks about
the modiﬁcation of the Davydov problem.
Indeed, ac-
cording to the 1D model, the vibron-phonon dynamics
along a single spine of hydrogen-bonded peptide units
reduces to that of a chain formed by the sites n, n + 3,
n + 6 ... . In a similar way, since a real 3D helix is invari-
ant under a rotation of angle θ0 followed by a translation
of length h, the vibron-phonon dynamics reduces to that
of a 1D lattice formed by all the sites n, n+1, n+2, n+3,
... . As the result, in a 3D protein, both the vibron and
the phonon reduced wave vectors lye in a Brillouin zone
three times greater than the Brillouin zone introduced in
the 1D model. In addition, the vibron-phonon dynamics
is now governed by long range interactions. Interactions
between nearest and second nearest neighbor sites char-
acterize coupling between diﬀerent spines of hydrogen-
bonded peptide units. By contrast, interactions between
third nearest neighbor sites account for the coupling in
a given spine. These latter couplings correspond to the
nearest neighbor interactions in the 1D Davydov model.
The analysis of the collective motion of the residues has
revealed that the phonon spectrum exhibits an acoustical
branch. In the long-wavelength limit, this branch char-
acterizes the longitudinal sound wave which propagates
along the spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units, as
in the 1D Davydov model. However, since the residues
are allowed to move in a 3D space, new features occur
in a real α-helix. First, the spectrum exhibits an optical
branch associated to a high frequency breathing motion
of the radius of the helix. More precisely, this radial
motion takes place in the long-wavelength limit whereas
hybridizations with a torsional motion of the helix back-
bone occur as when increasing the phonon wave vector.
In other words, optical phonons originate in the cova-
lent bonds between diﬀerent spines of hydrogen-bonded
peptide units. Then, in a marked contrast with the 1D
Davydov model, the polarization of the acoustic branch
strongly depends on the phonon wave vector. More pre-
cisely, a strong hybridization between longitudinal and
radial motion takes place when k reaches 2π/3. In that
case, the acoustical branch does not refer to longitudinal

sound wave anymore.

±

3, n

In fact, the wave vector k = 2π/3 plays a key role
for acoustical phonons. Near k = 2π/3, the shape of
the acoustic branch strongly depends on the geometry
of the helix backbone through the value taken by the θ0
angle.
Indeed, when θ0 = 2π/3, our calculations have
shown that this branch tends to zero (not drawn in Fig.
2). This surprising feature can be understood as follows.
When θ0 = k = 2π/3, it is straightforward to show that
the local frames n, n
6, ... are equivalent and that
±
all the motions of the corresponding residues are in phase
since exp(ikn) = exp(ik(n
6)) = ....
±
Therefore, these motions correspond to a zero frequency
uniform translation along the axis of the helix so that
the physics is equivalent to that of the 1D model at the
center of its own Brillouin zone. When θ0 decreases to
reach the value characterizing the α-helix conformation,
i.e. θ0 = 100o, the equivalence between the local frames
n, n
6, ... is broken. As a result, in phase motions
of the associated residues do not correspond to a uniform
translation anymore but are connected to an hybridiza-
tion between radial and torsional motions. Therefore, a
non vanishing frequency occurs in the spectrum.

As mentioned previously, the vibron dynamics in a 3D
α-helix protein is characterized by two kinds of hopping
processes. The ﬁrst kind refers to vibrational transi-
tion between diﬀerent spines of hydrogen-bonded pep-
tide units whereas the second kind involves vibron hops
along the same spine. In that context, the nature of the
vibron dynamics essentially results from the competition
between these two kinds of processes. Within the un-
dressed limit, i.e. when the vibron-phonon interaction
is disregarded, vibron transitions between nearest neigh-
bor and third nearest neighbor sites represent the dom-
12.4 cm−1 and
inant hopping mechanism since J(1) =
J(3) = 7.8 cm−1 whereas J(2) = 3.9 cm−1.
In other
words, the 3D nature of the protein plays a crucial role
and the vibron is delocalized between the diﬀerent spines.
However, our calculations have clearly shown that the
dressing eﬀect strongly modiﬁes the value of the eﬀective
hopping constants and aﬀects in a diﬀerent way the two
kinds of hopping processes. Indeed, at low temperature
so that the small po-
Jef f (2)
|
laron behaves almost like the undressed vibron. This is
no longer the case as when the temperature is increased
because the two kinds of hopping processes do not ex-
perience the same dressing eﬀect. Indeed, the dressing
for vibrons hops between diﬀerent spines is more eﬃcient
than the dressing which aﬀects vibron transitions along
the same spine. As a result, above a critical temperature
becomes the dominant hopping constant. In
|
others words, the dressing eﬀect strongly reduces the vi-
brational exchange between diﬀerent spines so that the
small polaron tends to propagates almost along a sin-
gle spine of hydrogen-bonded peptide units. Therefore,
at biological temperature, the small polaron dynamics is
rather similar to the dynamics described by the standard
1D Davydov model. Note that the crossover between

the two regimes, i.e. inter-spine and intra-spines vibron
hops, is also induced by both an increase of the small po-
laron binding energy and a modiﬁcation of the θ0 angle
which deﬁnes the helix backbone geometry. In this latter
case, when θ0 tends to 2π/3, the vibrational exchanges
between diﬀerent spines vanish and only
re-
mains ﬁnite (see Fig. 5c).

Jef f (3)

|

These features essentially originate from the coupling
between the vibron and the acoustical phonons of the
protein. Indeed, our calculations have revealed that the
contribution to the dressing of the optical phonons is
rather small, i.e. typically about two orders of magnitude
smaller than the contribution of the acoustical phonons.
This eﬀect comes from the fact that the coupling constant

At this step, the role played by the θ0 angle as well
as the fact that inter-spine or intra-spine vibron hops
are subjected to a diﬀerent dressing suggest that the ob-
served features originate in the singular behavior of the
acoustical phonons near the wave vector k = 2π/3. In-
deed, to understand more clearly this eﬀect, let us assume
an helix conformation with θ0 = 2π/3. As mentioned
6,
previously, in that case, the local frames n, n
3, n
... are equivalent. When k = 2π/3, the residues n, n
3,
n
6, ... move in phase according to a zero frequency uni-
form translation. As a consequence, the frequency of the
nth amide-I vibration does not experience any modula-
tion due to the motion of these residues. By contrast, the
coupling constant Sa(n, t) with residues located in diﬀer-
ent spines diverges since the phonon frequency is equal to
zero. It results from this behavior around k = 2π/3 that
the hopping constant along a given spine is slightly af-
fected by the dressing eﬀect whereas hopping constants
between diﬀerent spines vanish. When θ0 decreases to
100o, the equivalence between the local frames n, n
3,
n
is broken. Nevertheless, the motion of the
residues along a given spine are more in phase than the
motion due to residues located onto diﬀerent spines. As
a consequence, the modulation of a particular amide-I
vibration due to the motion of residues located on diﬀer-
ent spines is more important than the modulation pro-
duced by residues located in the same spine. Therefore,
the dressing eﬀect experienced by a vibron moving along
a given spine is always smaller than the dressing eﬀect
which aﬀects vibron hops between diﬀerent spines. Note
that the previous results corroborate the calculations per-
formed by Hennig [17] who have shown, within the soliton
approach, that the preferred transport path takes place
along a given spine whereas inter-spine energy transfer is
suppressed.

Finally, let us mention that the creation of a vibron
in a 3D protein is accompanied by a deformation of the
helix backbone diﬀerent than the distortion which oc-
curs in the 1D Davydov model. Indeed, we have shown
that the residues located on the spine where the vibron

has been excited experience a more intense deformation
than the other residues. This feature originates in the
fact that inter-spine covalent bonds are more rigid than
intra-spine hydrogen bonds. As a consequence, a distor-
tion propagates more easily along a spine of hydrogen-
bonded peptide units than along a covalent bond. The
main consequence is that residues located on the excited
spine do not react as residues located on the two other
spines so that an asymmetric deformation of the helix
backbone occurs. Due to this asymmetric behavior, the
radial displacement of the residues located on the excited
spine exhibits an important decrease whereas the radial
displacement of the other residues just slightly increases.
In the same way, both the longitudinal and the torsional
deformations appear as kink-like solitons characterized
by oscillations which account for the fact that the distor-
tion essentially aﬀects the excited spine, only.

In that context, we basically recover the results ob-
tained by Hennig [17] although our 3D model slightly
Indeed, as Hennig, we
diﬀers from its cylinder model.
have shown that the longitudinal distortion in a 3D helix
is smaller than the distortion occurring in the standard
1D model. This feature is due to the fact that in a 3D
helix inter-spine covalent bonds tend to prevent the defor-
mation of the hydrogen bonds. In addition, Hennig has
shown that the helix radius decreases in the excited re-
gion according to a deformation two orders of magnitude
smaller than the longitudinal distortion. As explained
previously, the helix model we use does not reduce to a
cylinder. Therefore, when a vibron is excited on given
site, the three spines react in an asymmetric way. Never-
theless, the decrease of the helix radius was obtained, but
for the residues belonging to the excited spine, only. In
addition, we have shown that the amplitude of the radial
deformation is about the same order of magnitude than
the longitudinal distortion.
In a marked contrast with
Hennig who has assumed that the decrease of the radius
originates in the optical phonons only, our model sug-
gests that both optical and acoustical phonons strongly
aﬀect the radial deformation.
In fact, our calculations
have clearly shown that both the radial and the longitudi-
nal distortions are essentially governed by the acoustical
phonons so that they have the same order of magnitude.

The ﬁrst kind refers to vibrational transitions between
diﬀerent spines whereas the second kind involves vibron
hops along the same spine. Our study has revealed that
several parameters such as the temperature, the small
polaron binding energy and the helix backbone confor-
mation, allow for a transition between two regimes. In-
deed, at low temperature or weak small polaron binding
energy, the polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delo-
calized between the diﬀerent spines. By contrast, at bio-
logical temperature or strong small polaron binding en-
ergy, the dressing eﬀect strongly reduces the vibrational
exchanges between diﬀerent spines so that the polaron
tends to propagate along a single spine, only. The occur-
rence of these two regimes also depends on the helix back-
bone geometry via the value of the θ0 angle and it has
been shown that when θ0 tends to 2π/3 inter-spine vibron
hops are suppressed. Although the phonon spectrum ex-
hibits both an acoustic branch and an optic branch, it
has been shown that the previous features originate in the
coupling between the vibrons and the acoustical phonons
which exhibit a singular behavior near k = 2π/3.

Finally, the previous results clearly show that the stan-
dard 1D Davydov model is a rather good approximation
at biological temperature for which the dressing eﬀect
drastically reduces inter-spine vibron hops. In that case,
for the vibron dynamics, the helix protein can thus be
viewed as formed by three independent spines.

To conclude, let us mention that the present paper is
the ﬁrst step of a more general analysis devoted to the
inﬂuence of the 3D nature of the α-helix onto the vibron
dynamics. Therefore, the study of the interaction with
the remaining phonons via the coupling ∆H will be ad-
dressed in a forthcoming paper. This interaction, respon-
sible for polaron dephasing, is fundamental to understand
and to interpret both infrared absorption spectra and vi-
brational transport properties. Moreover, it should al-
low inter-spine energy transfer even if the corresponding

investigations will be devoted to two-polaron eigenstates
since two-polaron bound states, which can be observed
with nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy [12, 13], are ex-
pected to play a key role for energy storage due to their
formal resemblance with quantum breathers.

VI. CONCLUSION

APPENDIX A: GENERAL EXPRESSION OF THE
DYNAMICAL MATRIX

In the present paper, the vibron dynamics associated
to amide-I modes in a 3D α-helix protein has been de-
scribed. The protein was modeled by three spines of
hydrogen-bonded peptide units linked via covalent bonds.
To remove the strong coupling between the vibrons and
the phonons associated to the external motion of the
residues, a Lang-Firsov transformation was applied and a
mean ﬁeld procedure was performed to obtain the dressed
vibron point of view. It has been shown that the vibron
dynamics, due to the 3D nature of the helix, results from
the competition between two kinds of hopping processes.

In a general way, the force constant tensor Eq.(4) is

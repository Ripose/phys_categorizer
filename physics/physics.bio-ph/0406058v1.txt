Abstract

We develop a general theory for active viscoelastic materials made of polar ﬁlaments. This theory

is motivated by the dynamics of the cytoskeleton. The continuous consumption of a fuel generates

a non equilibrium state characterized by the generation of ﬂows and stresses. Our theory can be

applied to experiments in which cytoskeletal patterns are set in motion by active processes such as

those which are at work in cells.

INTRODUCTION

Molecular biology has scored an impressive number of success stories over the last forty

years. It has provided us with a vast knowledge about molecules at work in living systems,

about their involvement in speciﬁc biological functionalities and about the structure of their

chemical networks [1]. Yet one is still unable to take advantage of this knowledge for con-

structing a comprehensive description of cell behavior. Assuming that we had all desired

molecular informations, the computer time required to describe meaningful cell behavior

would be totally prohibitive. Meanwhile there is a clear need for a generic description of

cells.

An alternative approach consists in identifying a reduced number of key characteristics

and construct a phenomenological description of a ”simpliﬁed” but relevant cell. Again

this task is currently too complex at the scale of a whole cell, but it can be envisioned for

some of its constituents. A good example is provided by the description of membranes:

for length scales of the order of a few tens of nanometers up, it can be considered as a

ﬂuctuating surface on which a few densities are distributed and through which a few other

densities permeate passively or actively [4, 5]. The construction of the theory has been going

on for more than thirty years. It sheds light on the physics of membrane shape, topology

changes such as budding, equilibrium and non equilibrium ﬂuctuations, membrane adhesion,

long range interactions on membranes etc... It is still under development to include out of

equilibrium features such as lipid and protein exchange with the bulk, but much has been

learned already.

Eﬀorts towards understanding the cytoskeleton are more recent. They have been focused

on the description of its passive visco-elastic properties which are now fairly well understood

in terms of gels made of cross-linked semi-ﬂexible polymers [6, 7]. Such materials which can

be prepared in vitro, are equilibrium systems which obey conventional thermodynamics. In

eukaryotic cells, the problem is however qualitatively new: the cross-links can be made of

motor proteins which have their own dynamics driven by chemical energy. Experiments,

simulations and analytical descriptions, have shown that such systems have a rich and com-

plex behavior [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. One can grasp the degree

of complexity with the remark that cross-links deﬁne distances, in other words they deﬁne

a metric. The cross-linking agents being motor proteins they move and the metric evolves

2

with time.

In fact the problem is even more complex since cytoskeletal ﬁlaments are polar and out

of equilibrium: they polymerize at one end while depolymerizing at the other end. Such

a process called treadmilling is well known to biologists. The description of eukaryotic cy-

toskeletal gels should include all these features. We call these gels and more generally all

gels working in the presence of a permanent energy consumption ”active” gels. On large

length scales and long time scales, the properties of complex materials can be captured by a

generalized hydrodynamic theory based on conservation laws and symmetry considerations.

Such theories have been very successful in describing complex ﬂuids such as liquid crystals,

polymers, conventional gels, superﬂuids etc.

[21, 22, 23]. For instance all liquid crystal

display devices can be described by such theories. More recently active liquid crystals have

been considered within this same logic [24]. Here, we develop a hydrodynamic theory of

active gels. An example of such gel is the network of actin cytoskeletal ﬁlaments in the

presence of chemical processes which locally induce ﬁlament sliding and generate motion.

These active processes are mediated by motor proteins which hydrolyze a fuel, Adenosinet-

riphosphate (ATP). Since cytoskeletal ﬁlaments are structurally polar, each ﬁlament deﬁnes

a vector. This ﬁlamental structure can on large scales give rise to a polarity of the material

if ﬁlaments are aligned on average.

We develop the hydrodynamic theory of active polar gels systematically in several steps,

following standard procedures. First, we identify the relevant ﬁelds and write conservation

laws for conserved quantities. We identify the generalized ﬂuxes and conjugate forces in

the system. These ﬂuxes and forces deﬁne the rates of entropy production and dissipation.

Using the signature of forces and ﬂuxes with respect to time reversal, we deﬁne dissipative

and reactive ﬂuxes. These ﬂuxes can be expressed by a general expansion in terms of forces,

by writing all terms allowed by symmetry and by respecting the signatures with respect to

time reversal. By keeping the relevant terms to lowest order, this ﬁnally results in generic

dynamic equations which are valid in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium. We then provide

examples by analyzing the active gel mode structure and by discussing the spontaneous

dynamical behavior of topological singularities such as disclinations (asters and vortices) in

two dimensions. Eventually we discuss the merits of our approach, its current limitations

and ways to extend its domain of validity to the more relevant far from equilibrium regime.

Some of the results discussed here have been presented in Ref. [25].

II. FIELDS, DENSITIES AND CONSERVATION LAWS

We develop the hydrodynamic description of active gels starting with conservation laws.

The number density of monomers in the gel is denoted by ρ. The gel is created by poly-

merization of ﬁlaments from monomers. The monomers have a density ρ(a) in solution. The

treadmilling process and the active stresses in the gel create a ﬂow of the actin gel monomers

with a local velocity v. The gel current is then convective and mass conservation implies

that

∂ρ
∂t

+ ∇(vρ) = −kdρ + kpδS

Here kd is the depolymerization rate; we assume, as seems to be the case for actin, that the

depolymerization which occurs mostly at the branching points of the gel, has a rate propor-

tional to the local density. In some cases treated below, we will consider for simplicity that

depolymerization does not occur in the bulk but at the surface of the gel. In many situations,

ﬁlament polymerization is highly controlled and localized for example at the surface of the

gel. This is taken into account in Eq. (1) by introducing the surface polymerization rate

kp and δS denotes a Dirac-like distribution which is non-vanishing only at the gel surface S.

Similarly, we write a conservation law for free diﬀusing monomers,

(1)

(2)

∂ρ(a)
∂t

+ ∇j(a) = kdρ − kpδS

here, we have introduced the diﬀusive current j(a) of free monomers.

Active processes are mediated by molecular motors. The concentration of motors bound

to the gel c(b) is an important quantity to characterize the eﬀects of active processes in

the gel. Assuming for simplicity that the total number of motors is conserved, we write

conservation laws for c(b) and the concentration of freely diﬀusing motors in the solvent c(m)

which read

∂c(m)
∂t

∂c(b)
∂t

+ ∇j(m) = koﬀc(m) − konρ(c(m))n

+ ∇c(b)v + ∇j(b) = −koﬀc(b) + konρ(c(m))n

(3)

The attachment and detachment rates of motors to and from the gel are characterized by

the chemical rates kon and koﬀ. Here, we have taken into account that bound motors are

convected with the gel. The current of free motors is j(m) and we denote j(b) the current of

bound motors relative to gel motion. In general, binding of motors to the gel is cooperative,

4

and cannot be described as a second order reaction: groups of motors could bind together.

We use here an nth order chemical kinetics where the rates is proportional to (c(m))n.

A ﬁnal important conservation law is momentum conservation. In biological gels on scales

of micrometers, inertial forces are negligible and momentum conservation is replaced by the

force balance condition which reads

∂α(σtot

αβ − Πδαβ) + f ext

β = 0

(4)

where f ext

β

is an external force density. Locally, there are two forces acting on the gel, the

total stress tensor σtot

αβ and the pressure Π.

The dynamics of the system is speciﬁed if the ﬂow velocity v and the currents j(a), j(m) and

j(b) are known. The physical description of the currents is discussed in the following sections.

Furthermore, we have to take into account the polar nature of the gel. Individual ﬁlaments

are rod-like objects with two diﬀerent ends which therefore have a vectorial symmetry. If

the ﬁlaments in the gel are on average aligned, the material is oriented. We introduce a

polarization ﬁeld p to describe this orientation. The ﬁeld p is deﬁned by associating with

each ﬁlament a unit vector pointing to one end. The vector p is given by the local average

of a large number of these unit vectors.

III. CONSTITUTIVE EQUATIONS

The ﬂuxes of monomers and motor molecules are generated by forces which act on the

active gel and induce motion.

In this section, we identify the relevant forces and derive

general ﬂux-force relations. These relations deﬁne the material properties, and characterize

how the system reacts to diﬀerent types of generalized forces. Of particular signiﬁcance for

our theory is the existence of active processes mediated by molecular motors. In general, a

chemical fuel, such as Adenosine-triphosphate (AT P ), is used as an energy source. Motor

molecules consume AT P by catalyzing the hydrolysis to Adenosinediphosphate (ADP ) and

an inorganic phosphate and transduce the free energy of this reaction to generate forces

and motion along the ﬁlaments. The energy of AT P is also used for polymerization and

depolymerization of the ﬁlaments. The presence of the fuel is equivalent to a chemical

”force” acting on the system. We characterize this generalized force by the chemical potential

diﬀerence ∆µ of AT P and its hydrolysis products, ADP and phosphate. When ∆µ vanishes

5

the chemical reaction is at equilibrium and there is no energy production. When ∆µ > 0, a

free energy ∆µ is consumed per hydrolyzed AT P molecule.

Constitutive equations are obtained by ﬁrst identifying the ﬂuxes and the corresponding

conjugate generalized forces and then writing a general expansion for the ﬂuxes in terms of

the forces. We study in this paper an active gel close to thermodynamic equilibrium and

limit the expansion of ﬂuxes in terms of forces to linear order as in a standard Onsager

theory. We thus describe the linear response of the gel to generalized forces. We do this in

the most general way and write in the ﬂux-force expansion all terms which are consistent

with the symmetries of the system.

A. Fluxes and forces

We ﬁrst discuss the rate of entropy production in the active gel. A change in the free

energy F = U − T S per unit time can be written as

˙F = −

d3r

Z

αβ ∂αvβ + hα ˙pα + ∆µr + ∂αj(i)
σtot
n

α µ(i)

o

(5)

where the “dot” denotes a time derivative. The total deviatory stress tensor σtot

αβ is in general

is not symmetric; it is conjugate to the velocity gradient ∂αvβ. The ﬁeld conjugate to the

order parameter pα is the functional derivative of the free energy F of the gel at thermal
equilibrium, hα = − δF

δpα , where the functional derivative is taken for constant deformation,
temperature and number of particles. The current conjugate to the ﬁeld hα is the convected
time derivative of the polarization ˙pα = ∂pα

∂t + vβ∂βpα. The chemical force ∆µ is conjugate
to the AT P consumption rate r which determines the number of AT P molecules hydrolyzed

per unit time and per unit volume. Finally, µ(a), µ(m) and µ(b) are the chemical potentials

of free monomers, free motors and of motors bound to the gel, respectively.

Eq. (5) does not take into account the translational and rotational invariance of the active

gel, and the variables used are therefore not the proper conjugate ﬂuxes and forces. Indeed,

as shown in reference [32], since the free energy does not change under pure translations and

rotations of the gel, ignoring surface terms, we can rewrite Eq. (5) as

˙F = −

d3r

Z

σαβuαβ + hαPα + ∆µr − j(i)
n

α ∂αµ(i)

o

(6)

The total stress σtot has been decomposed into a symmetric part σαβ (with σαβ = σβα) and

and anti-symmetric part which is due to the torque exerted by the ﬁeld hα on the order

6

parameter pα:

σtot
αβ = σαβ +

(pαhβ − pβhα)

1
2

Here, uαβ = 1

2(∂αvβ + ∂βvα) is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor. The
current conjugate to hα includes a rotational contribution coming from the antisymmetric

part of the stress tensor, it reads

Pα =

pα =

+ (vγ∂γ)pα + ωαβpβ

D
Dt

∂pα
∂t

where we have used the corotational time derivative of the vector pα, ωαβ = 1

2 (∂αvβ − ∂βvα)

being the vorticity tensor of the ﬂow.

We can read oﬀ Eq. (6) the following pairs of conjugate ﬂuxes and forces:

ﬂux ↔ force

σαβ ↔ uαβ

Pα ↔ hα

r ↔ ∆µ

α ↔ ∂αµ(i)
j(i)

σαβ = σr

The rate of change of the free energy can be divided into reversible and irreversible parts
˙F = ˙Frev + ˙Firr where ˙Frev = ˙U and ˙Firr = −T ˙S. We therefore decompose the ﬂuxes into

a reactive part and a dissipative part. They are characterized by their diﬀerent signatures

with respect to time-reversal. Note, that the generalized forces have well-deﬁned signatures

with respect to time reversal: the rate of strain uαβ is odd under time reversal, while hα and

∆µ are even. We write

The dissipative ﬂuxes have the same signature under time reversal as their conjugate forces,

while reactive ﬂuxes have the opposite signature under time reversal. Therefore, σd

αβ is odd

under time reversal, while rd and P d

α are even. The reactive parts have correspondingly the

opposite signatures. As we show below, the currents j(i)

α do not have reactive parts. With

(7)

For a changing state of the system which is periodic in time with period T , the internal

energy is the same after one period. Therefore, in this case

(12)

These relations follow from the signatures of dissipative and reactive currents under time

reversal.

B. Maxwell model

In the absence of a net gel polarization p and for a passive system with ∆µ = 0, we

describe the viscoelastic gel by a Maxwell model. In order to keep our expressions simple and

to focus on the essential physics, we assume that the ratio of the bulk and shear viscosities

is 2/d where d is the space dimension. The Maxwell model relates the stress tensor to the

strain rate according to

1 + τ

σαβ = 2ηuαβ

D
Dt (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(13)

Here, η denotes the shear viscosity and τ the viscoelastic relaxation time. and E = η/τ is

the elastic modulus of the gel at short times. In Eq. (13), the time derivative of the stress

tensor taken in a reference frame moving with the material ﬂow must be used. For a tensor,

this implies that in the laboratory frame convective terms due to the ﬂuid ﬂow as well as

the rotation of the reference system due to the vorticity of the ﬂow need to be taken into

account. D/Dt denotes the corotational derivative of a tensor given by

Dσαβ
Dt

≡

∂σαβ
∂t

+ (vγ∂γ)σαβ + [ωαγσγβ + ωβγσγα]

(14)

Note that we include the geometrical non-linearities and that we use the most general ver-

sions of what is called a “Convected Maxwell Model” [26]. For the Maxwell model given by

Eq. (13), we can specify the reactive and the dissipative contributions to the stress tensor.

C. Dissipative ﬂuxes

We now generalize the relations (15) and (16) expressing dissipative and reactive ﬂuxes

in terms of generalized forces for an active polar gel. First, we write expressions for the

dissipative ﬂuxes. To linear order we ﬁnd

.

(18)

(19)

Note that the ﬁrst expression is a generalization for Eq. (15) of the Maxwell model. For a

sake of simplicity, we ignore the anisotropy of the viscosity and consider that all translational

viscosities are equal. This anisotropy could be introduced as in the classical description of

the hydrodynamics of liquid crystals. Couplings to ∆µ cannot appear in the equation of

the dissipative stress because it transforms diﬀerently under time reversal than uαβ. A

term coupling σd

αβ to the time derivative of hα can appear.

It is required by Onsager

symmetry relations since a corresponding coupling term with coeﬃcient ν1 does occur in the

equation for P d

the coupling of P d

α as shown in Appendix B. The dissipative coeﬃcients γ1 and Λ characterize
α and rd to hα and ∆µ, respectively. Here, γ1 is the rotational viscosity
which appears in classical nemato-hydrodynamics. Because of its signature with respect to

time reversal, cross-coupling terms involving uαβ do not appear in the expression rd. The
expression for P d

α to the time derivative of uαβ as derived in
α and rd. Since Pα is a
vector and r a scalar, we need a vector in the system to couple these equations. If the system

Appendix B. Cross-coupling terms occur also in the expressions for P d

α contains a terms coupling P d

is polar, this vector is provided by p. Therefore, the cross-coupling term characterized by λ1

involves pα. Note that because of the symmetry of the Onsager coeﬃcients, the coeﬃcients
λ1 ν1 and ¯ν1 are the same in diﬀerent equations. The last term in the expression of rd is a

9

crossed term with the current of bound motors discussed below. This term is also imposed

by the Onsager symmetry relations. We still have to specify the currents j(a)

α , j(m)
α

and j(b)
α

of monomers and motor molecules which do not have reactive components:

α = −D(a)∂αρ(a)
j(a)

α = −D(m)∂αc(m)
j(m)

α = −D(b)∂αc(b) + λpα∆µ
j(b)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

The ﬁrst two expressions are simple diﬀusive currents with diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(i), where

we have assumed for simplicity that couplings to hα can be neglected and that free diﬀusion

is not inﬂuenced by ∆µ. The expression (22) describes bound motors which are convected

with the gel. In addition to being convected with velocity v, motors move in a direction

given by the ﬁlament orientation if ∆µ is nonzero. This directed motion is characterized

by the coeﬃcient λ; the motor velocity vm on the ﬁlaments is such that c(b)vm

α = λpα∆µ.

Finally, velocity ﬂuctuations of motor motion are captured by a diﬀusive term with diﬀusion

constant D(b).

D. Reactive ﬂuxes

Reactive ﬂuxes are expressed in terms of the forces following their signature under time

translation invariance. Generalizing Eq.(16) for the reactive stresses of the Maxwell model,

we note that here cross coupling terms with the forces hα and ∆µ are possible. Taking into

account the tensorial structure of the stress tensor, we write

where we have introduced the phenomenological coeﬃcients ζ, ¯ζ, ζ ′, ν1 and ¯ν1. The tensor

contains nonlinear reactive terms to lowest order, resulting from the geometry of the ﬂow

ﬁeld with corresponding phenomenological coeﬃcients νi. Similar coeﬃcient have been in-

10

troduced in the so-called “eight constant Oldroyd model” in rheology [26]. The term pro-

portional to τ on the right hand side of Eq. (23) assures compatibility with the Maxwell

model in the absence of polarization and chemical fuel. For the reactive parts of Pα and r

we write

(1 − τ 2 D2

Dt2 )P r

α = −ν1uαβpβ − ¯ν1uββpα
rr = ζpαpβuαβ + ¯ζuαα + ζ ′pαpαuββ

(25)

(26)

Here we have written cross coupling terms of P r with the rate of strain uαβ. The linear

response matrix of reactive terms is antisymmetric, therefore the same coeﬃcients as in Eq.

(23) appear, however with opposite sign. The remaining Eq. (26) is constructed in the same

way with cross coupling coeﬃcients that have been introduced in Eq. (23). No reactive

cross-terms between Eqns. (25) and (26) exist.

E. Dynamic equations

Using the expressions for dissipative and reactive ﬂuxed discussed above, we now write

general hydrodynamic equations for the active viscoelastic and polar gel. Adding the dissi-

pative and reactive parts, we ﬁnd

(27)

(28)

(29)

In these equations, we have included geometric nonlinearities but have restricted other terms

to linear order for simplicity. Also, we have neglected chiral terms which in principle exist in

cytoskeletal systems but which are expected to be small. These equations are complemented

by the force balance condition (4).

11

Eq. (27) generalizes the expression of the stress tensor in the Maxwell model to active

systems with polarity. Indeed, even in the absence of stresses, the active terms proportional

to ∆µ generate a ﬁnite strain rate. Similarly, if all ﬂows are suppressed, the active terms

generate a nonzero stress tensor. Thus, the hydrolysis of AT P can generate forces and

material ﬂow in the gel via the action of active elements such as motors. These terms are
characterized by the coeﬃcients ζ, ζ ′ and ¯ζ Similarly, we ﬁnd active terms in the polar-

ization dynamics given by Eq. (28) described by the coeﬃcient λ1. Furthermore, material

ﬂow couples to the polarization dynamics via the coeﬃcients ν1 and ¯ν1. The rate of AT P

consumption r is primarily driven by ∆µ and characterized by Λ. However, it is also coupled

to the ﬂuid ﬂow and to the ﬁeld h acting on p. Note, that in addition surface terms can

be important. For example, if ﬁlaments polymerize at the gel surface with a rate kp (see

Eq. (1)), there is an additional contribution rS to ATP consumption which is localized at

the surface. In the following, we discuss situation where surface eﬀects can be captured by

introducing appropriate boundary conditions.

IV. HYDRODYNAMIC MODES

We now calculate the linear relaxation modes of an active polar gel. They can be obtained

from the linear response of the change in the gel density to externally applied forces. We

focus on the situation of a fully polarized gel far from an isotropic polar transition with the

polarization vector lying in the x-direction, i.e., p = ex is constant. We assume that the

gel is treadmilling, which implies that it moves at constant velocity v = v0ex, while the gel

mass is conserved. The treadmilling is due to polymerization and depolymerization of the

ﬁlaments at the gel surfaces located at x = x+ and x = x−, respectively. In the following,

we consider the case of an inﬁnite system where x+ are located at +∞ and x− to −∞ while

the treadmilling velocity v0 remains constant.

We restrict ourselves to modes for which the ﬁelds vary along the x-direction which is

the treadmilling direction, while the system is assumed to be homogeneous in the other

directions. In this case the dynamic equations (1)-(3) for the densities of polymerized actin,

bound and free myosin become eﬀectively one-dimensional and read

∂tρ + ∂x(ρv) = 0

∂tc(m) − D∂2

xc(m) = koﬀc(b) − konρ(c(m))n

(30)

(31)

12

∂tc(b) + ∂x(c(b)v + λ∆µ) = −koﬀc(b) + konρ(c(m))n

.

(32)

The actin monomers which are not part of the gel diﬀuse across the system and control by

their concentrations the treadmilling rate. The mechanical constitutive equation (27) takes

the form

2η∂xv = [1 + τ ∂t + τ v∂x](σ + ζ∆µ)

whereas the force balance in the presence of an external stress σext is expressed by

∂x(σ + σext) = ∂xΠ .

In these equations, the coeﬃcients λ and ζ, which are the Onsager coeﬃcients introduced

in the previous section, characterize the directed motion of motors along the ﬁlaments and
the actively generated stress in the gel (we have replaced here ζ + ζ ′ + ¯ζ by ζ.).

In a

situation far from equilibrium, nonlinearities become important. We therefore linearize
around the homogeneous steady state of the above equations given by ρ = ρ0, c(b) = c(b)
0 ,
c(m) = c(m)
)n = ρ0v0 and σ0 = −ζ∆µ. We

, v = v0, and σ = σ0, where koﬀc(b)

consider a small perturbation of this state, i.e., ρ = ρ0 +δρ and analogously for the remaining
quantities. To leading order, the active coeﬃcients can be expanded as ζ = ζ0 +ζρδρ+ζcδc(b)
and λ = λ0 + λρδρ + λcδc(b) to implement such nonlinearities which become relevant in all

realistic situations. Here, we have neglected the diﬀusion of bound motors and the diﬀusion

constant D(b) has been set to zero.

The linearized dynamical equations can be solved by Fourier-transformation in space and

time. The mode characterizing the variations of the density of unbound motors, c(m)(q, ω) as

a function of spatial wave vector q and temporal frequency ω, can be obtained from Eq. (31)

and is given by

Furthermore, we have introduced ¯ζρ = ζρ∆µρ0 as well as ¯ζc = ζc∆µ.

The relaxation modes of the system can be identiﬁed by the (complex) values of the

frequency ωn, for which the modulus vanishes µ(q, ωn) = 0. Indeed, the density relaxes as
ρ(q) ∼ eiωnt and instabilities in the system occur if the real part of iωn becomes positive.

For our present system, we ﬁnd that three independent relaxation modes exist, with n = 1

Note, that the propagation velocity c is proportional to the fraction of bound motors (1 +

the value of the parameters.

If it is positive, the gel is unstable and self-organizes into

propagating density proﬁles. Such solitary waves have been found in theoretical descriptions

of active polar ﬁbers [15, 16]. Experimentally, actin waves have been recently reported

in several cell types [28, 29, 30].

In the present context, there is only one propagating

mode, because space inversion symmetry has been broken due to treadmilling and to the

polarization of the gel. The polarization couples to the ﬁlament and motor densities only

through the active current of bound motors. If instead of motors, we have passive cross-

linkers, i.e., λ = 0 and in the absence of treadmilling, i.e., v0 = 0, space inversion symmetry

is restored. In this case c = 0 and

so that the mode is no longer propagating, but diﬀusive and always stable. Note, that

d is proportional to the fraction of unbound motors Tckoﬀ/(1 + Tckoﬀ). The existence of

propagating waves even in a viscous environment seems to be a general feature of active

media and has already been reported in an other context by Ramaswamy and coworkers

[24, 31].

The second mode is a chemical relaxation mode describing the binding and unbinding

of molecular motors to the polymerized gel, whereas the third mode describes the stress

relaxation towards its stationary value.

V. DYNAMIC POINT DEFECT IN TWO DIMENSIONS

As an example of active behavior in two dimensions described by Eqns. (29), we consider

in this section the dynamics of point defects in the vector ﬁeld p. First, we consider the

passive equilibrium state with ∆µ = 0 where all ﬂuxes vanish. Subsequently, we determine

stationary active solutions for ﬁnite ∆µ and determine their stability. We obtain a complete

diagram of states for asters, vortices and rotating spirals.

A. Asters and vortices at thermodynamic equilibrium

In order to study point defects in two dimension, we consider for simplicity the situation

where the orientation of p varies but the modulus is constant and we impose p2 = 1. In

this case, the free energy is given by the standard expression for a polar liquid crystal [32]:

F =

(cid:21)

(46)

where K1 = K and K3 = K + δK are the splay and bend elastic moduli and we have
introduced a Lagrange multiplier h|| to impose the constraint p2 = 1. The coeﬃcient k

describes the spontaneous splay allowed by symmetry for vector order. Note that there is

no twist term in two dimensions.

For ∆µ = 0, the system reaches an equilibrium steady state where all ﬂuxes and forces

vanish: σαβ = 0, uαβ = 0, Pα = 0, hα = 0 and r = 0. The equilibrium orientation of the

polarization p, corresponds to a vanishing orientational ﬁeld hα = −δF/δpα = 0. In order

to describe point defects, it is convenient to introduce polar coordinates (r, θ) and the angle

ψ(r, θ) which characterizes the components of the vector p: (pr = cos ψ, pθ = sin ψ), see

Fig. 1(a). The components of the orientational ﬁeld hα in cylindrical coordinates can be

written as hr = hk cos ψ − h⊥ sin ψ, and hθ = hk sin ψ + h⊥ cos ψ, where we have introduced

the components h|| and h⊥ parallel and perpendicular to the direction of p.

Considering for simplicity rotationally symmetric ﬁelds describing point defects with ψ =

ψ(r), we obtain

where we have ignored the spontaneous splay which leads to a boundary term.

The perpendicular ﬁeld is obtained by taking the functional derivative of the free energy

where the prime indicates derivation with respect to r. The value of the Lagrange multiplier

hk (the longitudinal ﬁeld) is chosen in such a way that the condition p2 = 1 is satisﬁed.

Four types of topological defects of charge one are possible, see Fig. 1(a) and (b). If

we assume that boundary conditions are always chosen to allow for solutions with constant

ψ, these solutions corresponds to asters with ψ(r) = 0 and ψ(r) = π and to vortices with

ψ(r) = ±π/2. The linear stability of asters and vortices against angular perturbations δψ(r)

where the minus sign corresponds to an aster and teh plus sign to a vortex.

If all the

eigenvalues of the linear operator on the right hand side are negative, the defect is stable,

and otherwise it is unstable. (We may note that this operator has the form of the negative

a quantum Hamiltonian of one particle.) Asters are stable for positive δK while vortices are

stable for δK negative. For the special case δK = 0, Eq. (49) becomes γ1∂ψ/∂t = K∆ψ,

where ∆ denotes the Laplace operator, and defects for any value ψ(r) = ψ0 are stable. These

defects are called spirals since the direction of polarization follows spirals with an equation

in polar coordinates given by

r(θ) = r0 exp[cot(ψ0)θ]

,

(50)

see Fig 1. (c).

B. Non-equilibrium steady states

We now discuss the eﬀect of a point defect in two dimensions if motors in the system are

active and ∆µ 6= 0. In this situation, spiral defects start to rotate and there are nontrivial

ﬂow and stress proﬁles. We assume that the system is incompressible, i.e., urr + uθθ = 0.

Using the expression of the strain rate tensor given in appendix, this imposes that vr = α/r.

The absence of singularity of the radial velocity for small r implies that α = 0, therefore

vr = 0 and urr = uθθ = 0.

The Onsager Eq. (28) for the polarization rate can then be written in cylindrical coordi-

nates. In a steady state, Pα = 0, we obtain at linear order:

(ν1 cos 2ψ − 1)urθ =

where we have expressed the orientational ﬁeld hα in terms of its parallel and perpendicular

coordinates. Similarly, Eqns. (27)-(29) can be rewritten in polar coordinates. Using urr =

uθθ = 0 and only taking terms to linear order in the generalized forces into account we ﬁnd

that the steady state obeys

In addition to the dynamic equations Eqns. (27)-(29), the force balance Eq. (4) has to be

satisﬁed. The θ component of the force balance equation ( Eq. (A6) of appendix A) is solved

by σtot

rθ = B/r2 where B is an integration constant. Since σtot

rθ must not diverge, B = 0 and

therefore σtot

rθ = 0 and σrθ = h⊥/2. The components σrr and σθθ of the stress tensor follow

from Eqns. (53) and (54). These stresses together with the radial component of the force

balance equation (Eq. (A5) of appendix A) determine the pressure proﬁle Π required to

ensure the incompressibility of the material.

C. Asters, vortices and spirals

We now determine the stationary solutions for point defects in non-equilibrium states.

From Eq. (51) we ﬁnd an expression for the parallel component of the orientational ﬁeld

Inserting this expression in Eq. (55), we obtain the non diagonal strain rate

hk = γ1(ν1urθ sin 2ψ − λ1∆µ)

(55)

(56)

(57)

where ˜ζ = ζ + ν1γ1λ1. This equation together with Eq. (52), where h⊥ is given by Eq. (48)

determines ψ and urθ. Eliminating urθ, we ﬁnd an equation for the steady state orientation

ψ

h⊥(4η + γ1(ν2

1 + 1 − 2ν1 cos 2ψ)) = γ1 sin 2ψ(ν1 cos 2ψ − 1)˜ζ∆µ

(58)

We now discuss special solutions to this equations as well as the stability of asters and

vortices obtained at thermal equilibrium for ∆µ = 0.

1. Spiral solutions for δK = 0

We ﬁrst consider the simple case where there is no anisotropy of the elastic constants:

δK = 0 and h⊥ = K∆ψ. Eq. (52) requires that spirals with constant ψ0 and h⊥ = 0 satisfy

cos 2ψ0 = 1/ν1. This selection of angle, which depends on the parameter ν1 is a dynamic

phenomenon. The same angle is selected for the orientation of nematic liquid crystals in

shear ﬂows. A steady state exists only if |ν1| ≥ 1. The polarization angle takes one of the

two values

in the interval [−π, π]. With these values of ψ0, we ﬁnd

The velocity is ortho-radial, along the θ direction; it is obtained from (A3)

where v0

θ is an integration constant. For a ﬁnite system with radius R and with the boundary

condition that no motion occurs at the boundary,

2. Stability of asters and vortices

Both asters with ψ0 = 0, π and vortices ψ0 = ±π/2 are solutions to Eq.(58). In order to

understand under which conditions these solutions are stable, we perform a linear stability

given by

Linearizing this equation and using Eq. (57) we ﬁnd for asters with ψ0 = 0 and δK > 0

The resulting stability diagram in the (˜ζ∆µ, δK)-plane is displayed on Fig. 2. We have

assumed on this diagram that ν1 ≥ 1. There are three regions on this diagram, a region
with positive δK and positive ˜ζ∆µ where the asters are stable, a region with negative δK
and positive ˜ζ∆µ where vortices are stable and a region with large negative ˜ζ∆µ where

spiral defects are stable. Along the line δK = 0, spirals are always stable as studied in the

previous paragraph. We do not give here a general description of the spiral defects, as in the

case where δK = 0, we expect that there is a dynamic selection of the orientational angle

and that the defect is rotating.

20

D. Eﬀects of friction with the substrate

So far we have considered the point defect in a real two-dimensional space. A real active

gel interacts with both the surrounding solvent and the substrate. We do not discuss the

hydrodynamic interactions between the gel and the solvent here. We now consider a thin

quasi-two dimensional gel layer and introduce a friction force at the substrate proportional

to the local velocity. Taking into account the rotational symmetry, the friction force modiﬁes

the ortho-radial (θ) component of the force balance that becomes

(69)

This equation, which is a balance between the friction force and the tangential stress can

In the absence of elastic constant anisotropy, δK = 0, we can derive the velocity proﬁle

vθ(r) in an inﬁnite system from Eq. (70) as follows: We look for a solution of Eq. (52) with

h⊥ = 0 and ψ =const.. As in the absence of friction, the polarization angle can have one

of the 4 possible values satisfying cos 2ψ0 = 1/ν1. The velocity ﬁeld is then obtained from

Eq. (55) that can be transformed into the following ordinary diﬀerential equation for vθ:

where z = r/λf and the the friction length is given by λf = (4η + γ1ν1 sin2 2ψ0)1/2/(2ξ1/2).

The velocity is then given by

where K1 is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind deﬁned in Ref. [33],

At short distances (r ≪ λf ), the dissipation is dominated by the viscosity η and the

velocity ﬁeld is the same as in the absence of friction. At large distances, the dissipation is

dominated by the friction on the substrate ξ and the velocity vθ decays to zero. The stability

diagram of the defect in the presence of substrate friction is very similar to the diagram of

Fig. (3) where the ﬁnite size R would be replaced by the friction length λf .

VI. DISCUSSION

We have introduced in this manuscript equations which describe the long wavelength and

low frequency behavior of active gels. Although we have written the equations speciﬁcally in

the case where the activity is due to motor proteins, they should apply, in their principles,

to all gels in which a permanent source of dissipation is at work. Such gels deﬁne a new class

of materials. For instance, a conventional ”physical” polar gel, absorbing a high frequency

ultrasonic wave should obey, in the low frequency, long wavelength limit, the set of equations

proposed here. Our main motivation however, is the construction of a generic theory for

characterizing quantitatively the properties of Eukaryotic biological gels. One could object

that generalized hydrodynamic theories involve a large number of parameters and are thus

not very useful. Their merit is to involve the smallest number of parameters required for

a relevant description of the systems under consideration and to describe in a uniﬁed way

all long length scale and long time scale situations which are otherwise seemingly uncon-

nected. The nature of most parameters is already well-known for gel or polymer rheology

or for liquid crystal physics, and their measurement techniques can straightforwardly be

transfered to active gels. This is transparent for translational, orientational elastic moduli

and viscosities. Coeﬃcients linking shear ﬂow and polar orientation are less familiar to the

general public but are well known to liquid crystal physicists, and their measurements are

not diﬃcult a priori. There are six bulk and two surface additional parameters, compared

to a passive polar gel. Among the bulk quantities one is equivalent to the motor velocity

on the actin ﬁlaments (λ), and another one is the depolymerization rate kd of the gel in the

bulk. Both quantities are directly accessible to experiment. Surface polymerization terms

can be extracted independently from biochemical data and although they generate a new

interesting physics ([3, 34]), they do not introduce uncertainties in the description.

Among the four remaining parameters, three (ζ, ¯ζ and ζ ′ bear essentially the same physics

(i.e: the activity implies either spontaneous motion or spontaneous stress), and the last one

λ1 measures the active rate of change of polarization. Hence, there are only two relevant

additional parameter, namely λ1 and ζ with respect to a passive polar gel. We show, in the

two examples developed here, that they change profoundly the behavior of gels: behaviors

which in the absence of energy input would be static, become dynamic. The structure of

the relaxation modes which would be entirely over-damped in the long wavelength limit,

22

now can support propagative waves [24, 31], spiral disclinations rotate permanently. Many

other consequences have to be unraveled. Knowing that it has taken more than ten years to

investigate the properties of generalized hydrodynamical equations relevant to liquid crystals,

it is likely that a similar number of years will be necessary in this case as well. Our bet is

that it will help us understand the complex behavior of the slow dynamics of the eukaryotic

cytoskeleton in a robust way, not depending on the details of the involved proteins.

Our theory can be extended in several ways. First we have ignored the permeation process

of the bulk ﬂuid through the gel. This is legitimate in the long time limit in most geometries

but not all. The inclusion of permeation in our equations would be straightforward. We have

also used the simplest visco-elastic gel theory: experiments performed on cells suggest the

existence of scale invariant visco-elastic behavior which could also be included in the theory

[35]. At last we have assumed that the driving force was ”small” and constant both in space

and time. The spatial and temporal invariance make sense in a cell since the AT P produc-

tion centers seem to be abundant and evenly distributed. In vitro experiments may mimic

these conditions on a limited time scale, yet large compared to most phenomena of interest.

Furthermore there is no a priori diﬃculty in introducing AT P production and consumption

in the equations. More severe is the last limitation: our equations are valid for ∆µ small

compared to thermal energy, whereas it is of the order of ten time that value in real life.

The extension of our theory to large ∆µ is a real challenge and will probably require some

feedback from experiments. A brute force expansion in higher powers of forces and ﬂuxes is

just totally impractical and would leave out the known and probably leading exponential de-

pendences of polymerization/depolymerization rates on stress. Other challenging questions

concern the nature of noise which will pick up strong out of equilibrium contributions, and

possible dynamical transitions for instance in the motor behavior[36]. For these reasons, we

think that is it wise to start with the well controlled approach that we propose here and to

develop the corresponding experiments. This will help us familiarize with this new physics

before getting to regions of phase space were we lack guiding principles.

An important application of active gels is the problem of cell locomotion on a substrate

[37]. In a forthcoming publication, we will discuss how the interplay of polymerization and

activity can induce the motion of a thin layer of an active gel on a solid surface. The

physics of this gel motion coupled to the properties of bio-adhesion provides a basis for an

understanding of the locomotion of cells such as keratocytes [38].

APPENDIX B: VISCOELASTIC POLAR GEL

The form of Equations (17), (18), (23) and (25) can be understood by discussing the

general dynamics of the polarization ﬁeld pα in frequency space. As a function of frequency,

we write to linear order

where the tilde denotes a Fourier amplitude at frequency ω. The ﬁrst two terms of the right

hand side correspond to a straightforward linear response theory of a ferroelectric liquid

crystal. Similarly, the last term provides for ω = 0 the reactive linear coupling term allowed

by symmetry. For ﬁnite frequency furthermore, this term takes into account that the gel is

elastic on short time scales or large ω. This can be seen as follows: in the case of an elastic

gel, the free energy F of the polarization ﬁeld contains elastic terms of the form

Fel =

where ǫαβ is the strain tensor characterizing deformations of the gel. This leads to a mod-
iﬁcation of hα by hel

α = −δFel/δpα. Since in frequency space, ˜uαβ = iω˜ǫαβ, Eq. (B1) does

describe the correct elastic limit for large ω Separating Eq. (B1) in reactive and dissipative

allows us to identify P d

parts, using the opposite signatures with respect to time reversal (or equivalently ω → −ω)
α. Using 1/(1 + iωτ ) = 1 − iωτ /(1 + ω2τ 2) and replacing iω
by D/Dt, we can write the reactive and dissipative parts of Pα as given by Eqns. (18)and

α and P r

(25). Symmetry relations now impose the correct equations for σd

αβ and σr

αβ as given by

Eqns. (17) and (23).

FIG. 2: Stability diagram of asters, vortices and spirals which are topological defects in an active

gel of polar ﬁlaments. Asters are stable for δK > 0 in the region with actively generated stresses

˜ζ∆µ larger than a critical value ˜ζ∆µA

c . This critical value is negative, corresponding to contractile

stresses in the gel. Vortices are stable for δK < 0 and ˜ζ∆µ > ˜ζ∆µV

c . For other parameter

values, rotating spirals occur via a symmetry breaking dynamic instability. Here, δK = δK/K is a

dimensionless ratio of two elastic moduli and ζ∆µ = R2 ˜ζ∆µ/K a dimensionless measure of active

stresses. Note that both rotation senses occur with equal probability on symmetry grounds. The

diagram was evaluated for the choice η/γ1 = 1 and ν1 = 2 of Onsager coeﬃcients of the system.

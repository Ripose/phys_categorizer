Characteristic Length Scale of Electric Transport Properties of Genomes

C. T. Shih
Department of Physics, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan
(Dated: January 19, 2014)

A tight-binding model together with a novel statistical method are used to investigate the relation
between the sequence-dependent electric transport properties and the sequences of protein-coding
regions of complete genomes. A correlation parameter Ω is deﬁned to analyze the relation. For
some particular propagation length wmax, the transport behaviors of the coding and non-coding
sequences are very diﬀerent and the correlation reaches its maximal value Ωmax. wmax and Ωmax
are characteristic values for each species. The possible reason of the diﬀerence between the features
of transport properties in the coding and non-coding regions is the mechanism of DNA damage
repair processes together with the natural selection.

The conductance of DNA molecules is one of the cen-
tral problems of biophysics because it plays a critical role
in the biological systems. For example, it is postulated
that there may be proteins which can locate the DNA
damage by detecting the long-range electron migration
properties[1, 2]. And for the interest of applications,
DNA is one of the most promising candidates which may
serve as the building block of molecular electronics be-
cause of its sequence-dependent and self-assembly prop-
erties.

There have been many experimental

results on
the conductance of DNA from diﬀerent measurements
for the last few years.
Yet the results are still
highly controversial[3]. The experimental results al-
most cover all possibilities, ranged from insulating[4],
semiconducting[5], Ohmic[6, 7], and even induced
superconductivity[8]. The diversity comes from the
methods of the measurements and the preparation of
DNA samples. One of the critical factors inﬂuencing
the results is the contact of the DNA and electrodes[4,
9, 10, 11]. The diﬀerent nucleotide sequences of the
DNA molecules used in the experiments also diversify
the results because the transport properties are sequence-
dependent.

Aside from the electrical properties, the statistical fea-
tures of the symbolic sequences of DNA have also been
studied intensely during the past years[12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17]. The previous works are mainly focused on the corre-
lations and linguistic properties of the symbols A, T, C,
and G, which represent the four kinds of bases adenine,
thymine, cytosine, and guanine of the nucleotides, re-
spectively. The analyses also give some eccentric results.
For example, the statistical behavior of the intron-free
coding sequences is similar to random sequences while
the intron-rich or junk sequences have long-range cor-
relations. One should note that the root of these sta-
tistical properties of the symbolic sequences are the re-
sults of evolution, and the underlying driving forces are
the principles of physics and chemistry. On the other
direction, the correlation of sequences will inﬂuence the

physical and chemical properties, such as the electric and
mechanical properties of DNA[18]. Thus it is reasonable
to conjecture that the sequence-dependent electric prop-
erties can play critical roles during the evolution process
in nature by some ways such as the DNA damage repair
processes[1, 2]. In this Letter, the relation between elec-
tric transport properties and the gene-coding/nocoding
parts of genomic sequences will be discussed.

The simplest eﬀective tight-binding Hamiltonian for a
hole propagating in the DNA chain can be written as[19,
20]

ator of a hole at the n−th site.
ǫn is the potential
energy at the n−th site, which is determined by the
ionization potential of the corresponding nucleotide. ǫn
equals to 8.24 eV, 9.14 eV, 8.87 eV, and 7.75 eV for n =
A, T, C, and G, respectively[21]. The DNA molecule
is assumed to be connected between two semi-inﬁnite
electrodes with energy ǫm = ǫG = 7.75 eV. The hop-
ping integral tn,n+1 = tm = 1 eV for electrodes and
tn,n+1 = tDN A for nucleotides.
tDN A is assumed to
be nucleotide-independent here for simplicity. Typical
value of tDN A = 0.1 ∼ 0.4 eV from the ﬁrst-principle
calculation[21, 22]. To reduce the back scattering eﬀect
at the contacts, larger tDN A (up to 1 eV) is also used in
this study[19]. Note that n ∈ (−∞, 1] and n ∈ [N +1, ∞)
are for electrodes and n ∈ [2, N ] are for nucleotides.

The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian |Ψi =

n an|ni
(|ni represents the state that the hole is located in the
n−th site) can be solved exactly by using the transfer
matrix method:

wave functions are plane waves and the dispersion of
the hole is ǫm + 2tmcosk. So the range of possible E
is [ǫm − 2tm, ǫm + 2tm] = [5.75eV, 9.75eV ]. The transmis-
sion coeﬃcient has the following form[23]

The transmission of several sequences of complete
genomes S = (s1, s2, · · · , sNtot ) is studied (si = A, T ,
C, or G). Since the total length Ntot of the complete
genome is usually much longer than the distance which
holes can migrate along the DNA chain even for the
smallest Ntot for viruses, we won’t measure the trans-
mission through the whole chain but only shorter seg-
ments instead. A “window” with width w is deﬁned
to extract a segment Si,w = (si, si+1, · · · , si+w−1) for
1 ≤ i ≤ Nw = Ntot − w + 1 from S. Starting from
i = 1 and sliding the window, we can get the “transmis-
sion sequence” Tw(E, i) of Si,w for all i, which depends
on the energy of the injected hole E, the starting posi-
tion of the segment i, and the propagation length w. For
further analysis of the whole genome sequences, Tw(E, i)
is integrated in an energy interval [E, E + ∆E]:

¯Tw(E, ∆E, i) =

Tw(E′, i)dE′

In the remaining of the Letter, the transmission is inte-
grated for the whole bandwidth, that is, E = 5.75 eV
and ∆E = 4 eV. And these two values will be omitted in
the related formulas for short. 300 base pairs at the two
ends of the DNA chain will be omitted in the following
analysis because the telomere sequences at the terminals
usually have larger transmission (due to the periodicity)
and will dominate some of the average properties. Thus
Nw = Ntot − w + 1 − 2 × 300.

The averaged transmission T ave

¯Tw(i) ver-
sus propagation length w is plotted in Fig.1 for the third
chromosome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakery yeast,
accession number = NC.001135 for GenBank[24], simpli-
ﬁed as Y3 for short) with several values of tDN A/t0. T ave
decreases exponentially with increasing w, which is con-
sistent with the localization picture. The curves can be
w = ae−w/w0. The inset of Fig.1
ﬁtted by the function T ave
shows the averaged localization length w0 for each tDN A.
Note this is an averaged result of the complete genome,
and the possibility of high conductance of some particu-
lar segments is not ruled out. Other important features
are that ¯Tw(i) decreases faster for smaller tDN A, and w0

is nearly proportional to tDN A. The reason is that the
back scattering is stronger for smaller tDN A. Although
smaller tDN A (≤ 0.4 eV) values are more physical, the
signal revealing the intrinsic properties of the sequences
may be smeared out by the strong back scattering. T ave
for a random sequence R3 with the same length and ra-
tios of the four bases as Y 3 are also shown in the lines
of Fig.1. It is clear that the transmission of the random
sequence decreases faster (smaller w0) than the natural
genome due to the larger disorder. This result is consis-
tent with Ref.[19].

Since the transport properties are related to the DNA
damage repair mechanism, there could be correlation be-
tween the locations of genes and the corresponding in-
tegrated transmission ¯Tw(i) . In Fig.2, ¯T240(i) and the
coding regions are compared for part of the sequence of
Y3. It seems that most of the sharp peaks of ¯T240(i) are
located in the protein-coding region.

To check this correlation in a more quantitative way,

the coding regions have larger conductance. On the other
hand, Ω(w) for acinetobacter sp. ADP1, Deinococcus ra-

D/UW-3/CX are negative, which means the coding re-

To ensure that Ω(w) shown above are physically and
biologically meaningful, we compare the results with ran-
dom sequences. Ten sequences generated by the same
way as R3 are analyzed and the averaged Ω(w) (overlap
with the g(i) of Y3) are shown in Fig.4 (open circles with
error bars). It is clear that its overlap is about one order
of magnitude smaller then the real sequences. So Ωmax
and wmax are not artifacts, but intrinsic properties of

In Fig.3 Ω(w) for Y3 is shown for diﬀerent tDN A. For
tDN A = 1 eV, there is a maximum at wmax = 240 with
Ωmax = 0.103. Note that Ωmax denotes the maximal ab-
solute value of Ω(w) and can be positive or negative. The
strong positive overlap implies that the holes can move
more freely in the coding regions. As tDN A decreases,
both Ωmax and wmax decrease. For tDN A ≤ 0.5 eV,
the overlap becomes negative which means the electronic
conductance is poorer at the coding regions. The depen-
dence of Ωmax and wmax on tDN A are shown in the inset
of Fig.3. Although the values of wmax and Ωmax vary
with tDN A, G(i) and ¯Tw(i) are correlated in general.

Several Ω(w) with tDN A = 1 eV for diﬀerent genomes
are shown in Fig.4. It can be seen that there is maximal
positive or negative overlap Ωmax at some “characteristic
migration length” wmax for each genome. Ω(w) for yeast
chromosomes III, VIII and X, and Ureaplasma parvum
serovar 3 str. ATCC 700970 are positive, which means

genomes from the above comparison.

From the analysis above,

it can be concluded that
wmax is a characteristic length scale of the electric trans-
port, which can make out the gene-coding regions. And
Ωmax stands for the “sensibility” of this probing process.
The possible biological reason of these correlations is
the mechanism of DNA damage repair processes. Since
proteins use the transport properties to probe the loca-
tion of DNA damage[1, 2], the transport of the coding
areas should have particular features for the detecting
processes, while those of the non-coding regions are some-
what irrelevant.

Fig.4 shows two important features of Ωmax. First,
each species has their characteristic values (wmax, Ωmax).
It can be postulated that the mechanisms detecting the
defects of DNA of diﬀerent species are diﬀerent due to the
various biological and environmental features. Second,
(wmax, Ωmax) of the diﬀerent chromosomes of the same
species (yeast here) are very similar because they are
in the same environment, hence the same DNA damage
repair mechanism.

It should be noted that the model used in this study is
an oversimpliﬁed one. However, one of the most impor-
tant properties can be extracted from this coarse-grained
model – the coding regions have very diﬀerent transport
behavior from the noncoding parts at the characteristic
length scale wmax. And each species has diﬀerent wmax
to adjust their environment. In the future, the model will
be ﬁner-grained by introducing the more realistic interac-
tions like the base-dependent hopping[27], the sequence
dependent potentials[28], and the charge-charge interac-
tions.

In summary, with a new method combining the trans-
fer matrix approach and symbolic sequence analysis, the
correlation between the transport properties and the po-
sitions of genes is studied for complete genomes. There
are two characteristic values Ωmax and wmax for each
genome. These two values can provide information for
taxonomy or the mechanism of evolution.

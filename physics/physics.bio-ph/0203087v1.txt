Abstract

Many recent experiments with single DNA molecules are based on force versus extension mea-

surements and involve tethering a microsphere to one of its extremities and the other to a mi-

croscope coverglass. In this work we show that similar results can also be obtained by studying

the recoil dynamics of the tethered microspheres. Computer simulations of the corresponding

Langevin equation indicate which assumptions are required for a reliable analysis of the experi-

mental recoil curves. We have measured the persistence length A of single “naked” DNA molecules

and DNA–Ethidium Bromide complexes using this approach.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most important characteristics of the DNA molecule is its high mechanical

ﬂexibility. Thanks to this, the entire genome of each living organism, which can reach

several meters in length, ﬁts inside each of its cells. The ﬂexibility of the DNA molecule

also plays a key role in all its cellular functions, such as replication, transcription and

recombination. With recent advances in micromanipulation techniques, including the use of

magneto-optical traps [1], during the last decade, experiments with single DNA molecules

have become possible.

Once free in solution, single DNA molecules present entropic elastic behavior, well de-

scribed, in both low and high stretching regimes, by the Worm Like Chain (WLC) model

[2, 3, 4]. Using this model, the ﬂexibility of the polymeric chain can be inferred through the

ratio A/L, where A is its persistence length and L its contour length. Smaller A/L ratios

correspond to more ﬂexible chains. For the DNA molecule, where a complete chain can have

contour length L varying from around 2 µm to more than 1 m, the persistence length A is of

the order of 40

50 nm or 120

150 base pairs.

Usually the methods used to obtain A which employ the use of optical traps are based

on force versus extension measurements [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. One end of a single DNA molecule is

attached to a coverglass surface while the other end is tethered to a polystyrene microsphere

(ﬁgure 1). The optical trap can then be used to capture and move the microsphere, stretching

the DNA molecule. Obtaining force versus extension data for a DNA molecule, however,

requires a very precise characterization and calibration of the trap, a very delicate and time

consuming procedure which we would like to eliminate. To do so we shall use a diﬀerent

approach to obtain A without need of precise force measurements. Instead, we focus our

attention in the motion of the microsphere when we release it turning oﬀ the optical tweezers.

II. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE

The basic idea of the technique is very simple and has been introduced by Shivashankar

et al [8]. As in the force-based experiments, we use an optical tweezers to ﬁnd and trap a

microsphere anchored to a coverglass surface through a single tethered DNA molecule. The

trapped microsphere is moved, stretching the DNA molecule to as close as possible to its

contour length. The tweezers are turned oﬀ, releasing the microsphere, which is dragged

through the ﬂuid by the recoiling DNA molecule. Following the recoil of the microsphere

using videomicroscopy, we obtain a recoil curve R(t), from which we can extract information

about A and L.

According to [8], the recoil movement can be considered quasistatic since equilibration

time for the DNA molecule is very short compared with the time scale for the motion of

the microsphere, which means that, during relaxation, the DNA essentially passes through

a sequence of equilibrium stretched states. Because the time resolution of videomicroscopy

inertial eﬀects are negligible. As a result, the motion of the microsphere can be described

by

where R is the position of the microsphere, r is the distance between the extremities of the

DNA molecule, γ is the Stokes friction coeﬃcient, given by

where η is the viscosity of the medium and a is the radius of the microsphere, and Fdna(r)

is the entropic elastic force for the DNA molecule given by the WLC model [2, 3],

There are, however, two considerations to be made concerning Eq.(1). The ﬁrst is that

it cannot be integrated into an explicit analytic expression for R(t), even if we treat γ as a

no longer be considered constant and isotropic [10, 11].

Our ﬁrst approach was to try an integral ﬁting procedure to adjust the experimental

recoil curves R(t) with Eq.(1). That, however, turned out to be much less straightforward

than we had anticipated. We therefore decided to ﬁt the data solely with Eq.(1). To do so

we must apply a discrete derivative procedure to our data. Since the microsphere undergoes

Brownian motion while recoiling, such a numerical derivative may result in untrustworthy

data. To assure that this data analysis returns reliable results, our approach is to smooth

the recoil curve, aiming to eliminate the Brownian noise, and them perform the numerical

derivative. We have produced simulated recoil curves, taking into account both Brownian

noise and surface proximity eﬀects, and used them to test and improve the data analysis.

III. SIMULATION

To simulate the recoil dynamics of the microsphere we solve, numerically, the Langevin

equation for the system, using Fdna as an external force. In the non-inertial limit, we have

A. 3D Simulation - Constant γ

Until this point, we have assumed that the microsphere has only one-dimensional motion,

directed along the force axis. We must now remember that it is submitted to thermal noise

directed from all three dimensions of space and so undergoes three-dimensional Brownian

motion. To take this fact into account, we split Eq.(5) in three one-dimensional equations.

r represents the relative distance between the two extremities of the DNA molecule. Once

the DNA is attached to the surface of the microsphere, the two coordinate systems are

connected through Eq.(7), where a is the radius of the microsphere.

B. 3D Simulation - Variable Anisotropic γ

Using the usual, constant and isotropic, Stokes friction coeﬃcient γ implies we are as-

suming that the ﬂuid velocity at the microsphere surface is null, keeping, at the same time,

a constant value v0 far from it, in all directions. When there is an obstacle that interferes

with the ﬂuid ﬂow near the microsphere, such as the coverglass surface in the present case,

the second assumption is no longer valid and γ will depend on the direction of motion and

on the distance from the microsphere to the obstacle.

According to [10, 11], for a microsphere of radius a whose center of mass is at a distance

h from a planar surface, γ must be corrected to

where we have assumed the DNA molecule is at least 90% stretched, initially.

Once we have produced several simulated recoils with known parameters, including A,

we can apply our data analysis procedures, based on the recoil velocity of the microsphere,

to evaluate A and compare it to the value used in the simulation.

IV. DATA ANALYSIS

The data analysis process consists of 3 steps. First, the recoil curve is smoothed using

the Stineman smoothing function from KaleidaGraph [12] software package, ﬁltering out

high-frequency Brownian noise. The smoothed recoil curve then passes through discrete

derivation. The resulting velocity data are ﬁt according to Eq.(1).

Before proceeding with the analysis, however, we must keep in mind that, due to experi-

mental setup limitations, experimental recoil data are limited to the xy plane, i.e., although

we can set the initial height h0 of the microsphere, we can only record the x and y compo-

nents of the recoil curve. We therefore submit the simulated data to the same restriction,

using only the x and y components of the simulated recoil curves.

Choosing a coordinate system where the molecule is stretched along the x axis, the data

is ﬁt to the x component of Eq.(1), given by

However, to use Eq.(11) to ﬁt the experimental data, we must be able to obtain r, γ//

and R from the available information, i.e., from X1, a, h0 and γ. Since the DNA is stretched

along x, X2, set along y axis, will be ﬂuctuating around 0, allowing us to write

and once we use Eq.(7) and Eq.(8a), all we need is information about how the microsphere

moves vertically, i.e., how h changes with time. That information, however, is not available

to us due to experimental limitations of the setup. In order to ﬁt the data with Eq.(11), we

assume the recoil occurs along the force axis at an constant angle θ (ﬁgure 1). Elementary

geometry then allow us to write

h(t) =

h0
X1(t = 0)

X1(t).

(13)

Simulations conﬁrm that the assumption of constant θ is a good approximation for our

experiments.

Once h(t) has dropped to 1.4 µm, the microsphere has reached the surface and there is

no longer movement along the z direction. The recoil proceeds along the x axis with h(t)

held constant at 1.4 µm, the radius of the tethered polystyrene microsphere.

Since we cannot determine the contour length of each molecule in the experiments, L is

adjusted as a free parameter in the same way as the persistence length A.

V. SIMULATED RECOIL RESULTS

The complete set of initial conditions used in the simulations is given by Eq.(10), using the
10−2P oise.

Figure 2 shows a typical simulated recoil with A = 45 nm and L = 17.0 µm. Figures 3

and 4 show the x component of the recoil curve, before and after smoothing. Analysis of the

smoothed data from ﬁgure 4 resulted in A = 44 nm and L = 17.2 µm (ﬁgure 5).

We have simulated recoil curves under the same conditions for diﬀerent values of A,

shown in ﬁgure 6. Analysis of these recoils is shown in ﬁgure 7. The results obtained

through simulation are summarized in table I. The error bars come from the analysis of

diﬀerent recoil simulations and not from the ﬁt from a single curve. In order to have a very

well deﬁned simulated recoil curve, where the Brownian noise is averaged out, it is necessary

the accumulation of a great number of curves, what is experimentally time consumming and

not appropriate if we are interested in kinetic eﬀects like the interaction of a protein with

DNA as a function of time. Therefore, the ideia is to make a simple analysis of a single, or

even a few recoils, obtaining reliable results with known error bars.

VI. EXPERIMENT

A. Experimental Setup

The experiments are made on a Nikon TE300 Eclipse inverted optical microscope coupled

to two CCD cameras and a piezo driven stage (ﬁgure 8). We use a SDL 5422 near infrared

laser (λ = 832 nm) focused through an inﬁnity corrected objective lens (Nikon plan apo,

DIC H, 100

, 1.4 NA, oil immersion) to create the tweezers. Imaging from CCD 1 is used

from the near infrared light, is videorecorded for posterior analysis.

B. Sample Preparation

Samples are prepared using the same method described in [8], with slight variations.
We prepare a solution containing PBS (150 mM Na+) pH 6 and microspheres (Polybead

Polystyrene 2.8 µm microspheres, ρ = 1.05 g/ml, n = 1.6). The number of microspheres in

the solution is around 450/µl. For every 395 µl of solution, we add 5 µl of DNA solution

(New England Biolabs λ DNA 553 µg/ml), previously heated in a thermal bath at 62oC for

5 minutes, mix gently and incubate together for 20 minutes. The solution is then pipeted

into cells (

4 mm radius, 3 mm height) on coverglasses and then covered with cut pieces of

≈

coverglass to prevent excessive evaporation. After 24h of incubation at room temperature,
the cells are opened and gently washed with PBS (150 mM Na+) pH 7.4 to remove the

excess of free beads and reset the pH for the DNA. The cells are covered again and are then

ready for experiments.

C. Data Extraction

After videorecording the recoil through CCD 2, the images are analyzed using the Image

1.62 [13] software package. The x and y coordinates of the center of mass of the microsphere

are extracted from each frame and combined with the time index of the recording to give

X1(t) and X2(t). Figure 9 shows a sequence of frames from a recorded recoil.

The extracted recoil curves can then be analyzed using the same procedures developed

in sections IV and V.

VII. EXPERIMENTAL RECOIL RESULTS

Figure 10 shows typical experimental recoil curves for both naked DNA and DNA sat-

urated with Ethidium Bromide (a ﬂuorescent intercalating dye with high aﬃnity for DNA

molecules). Analysis of the smoothed recoil data, shown in ﬁgure 11, resulted in A = 46 nm

for naked DNA and A = 126 nm for DNA saturated with Ethidium Bromide.

The averaged value for the persistence length A obtained from diﬀerent molecules for a

single naked DNA molecule in a 150 mM Na+ buﬀer is

which is consistent with earlier work [6].

VIII. CONCLUSION

In recent years DNA persistence length measurements have been made through several

diﬀerent methods, ranging from spectroscopic techniques to electron microscopy. Each one

of these diﬀerent approaches comes with its own set of assumptions, as pointed out by Wang

et al. in [6], and is susceptible to diﬀerent sources of error.

We present a method to measure A from microsphere recoil that can provide quick and

reliable results for the study of micromechanical properties of biopolymers like DNA.

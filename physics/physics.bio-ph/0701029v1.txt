MULTISCALE COUPLING OF MOLECULAR DYNAMICS AND
HYDRODYNAMICS: APPLICATION TO DNA TRANSLOCATION
THROUGH A NANOPORE

MARIA G. FYTA† ‡, SIMONE MELCHIONNA§, EFTHIMIOS KAXIRAS† ‡ , AND SAURO

Abstract. We present a multiscale approach to the modeling of polymer dynamics in the
presence of a ﬂuid solvent. The approach combines Langevin Molecular Dynamics (MD) techniques
with a mesoscopic Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method for the solvent dynamics. A unique feature of
the present approach is that hydrodynamic interactions between the solute macromolecule and the
aqueous solvent are handled explicitly, and yet in a computationally tractable way due to the dual
particle-ﬁeld nature of the LB solver. The suitability of the present LB-MD multiscale approach is
demonstrated for the problem of polymer fast translocation through a nanopore. We also provide
an interpretation of our results in the context of DNA translocation through a nanopore, a problem
that has attracted much theoretical and experimental attention recently.

1. Introduction. Mathematical modeling and computer simulation of biolog-
ical systems is in a stage of burgeoning growth. Advances in computer technology
but also, perhaps more importantly, breakthroughs in simulational methods are help-
ing to reduce the gap between quantitative models and actual biological behavior.
The main challenge remains the wide and disparate range of spatio-temporal scales
involved in the dynamical evolution of complex biological systems.
In response to
this challenge, various strategies have been developed recently, which are in general
referred to as “multiscale modeling”. Some representative examples include hybrid
continuum-molecular dynamics algorithms [1], heterogeneous multiscale methods [2],
and the so-called equation-free approach [3]. These methods combine diﬀerent lev-
els of the statistical description of matter (for instance, continuum and atomistic)
into a composite computational scheme, in which information is exchanged through
appropriate hand-shaking regions between the scales. Vital to the success of this
information exchange procedure is a careful design of proper hand-shaking interfaces.
Kinetic theory lies naturally between the continuum and atomistic descriptions,
and should therefore provide an ideal framework for the development of robust multi-
scale methodologies. However, until recently, this approach has been hindered by the
fact that the central equation of kinetic theory, that is, the Boltzmann equation, was
perceived as an equally demanding approach as molecular dynamics from the com-
putational point of view, and of very limited use for dense ﬂuids due to the lack of
many-body correlations. As a result, multiscale modeling of nanoﬂows has developed
mostly in the direction of the continuum/molecular dynamics paradigm [1].

Over the last decade and a half, major developments in lattice kinetic theory [4, 5]

are changing the scene. Minimal forms of the Boltzmann equation can be designed
on the lattice, which quantitatively describe the behavior of ﬂuid ﬂows in a way that
is often computationally more advantageous than the continuum approach based on
the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, lattice kinetic theory has proven capable of
dealing with complex ﬂows, such as ﬂows with phase transitions and strong hetero-
geneities, for which continuum equations are exceedingly diﬃcult to solve, if at all
known (for a recent review see [6]). These advances have opened the road to devel-
oping new mesoscopic multiscale solvers [7]. The present work provides a successful
implementation of such an approach. We will focus on the coupling of a mesoscopic
ﬂuid solver, the lattice Boltzmann method, with simulations at the atomistic scale
employing explicit molecular dynamics. A unique feature of our approach is the dual
nature of the mesoscopic kinetic solver, which propagates coarse-grained informa-
tion (the single-particle Boltzmann probability distribution), along straight particle
trajectories. This dual ﬁeld/particle nature greatly facilitates the coupling between
the mesoscopic ﬂuid and the atomistic levels, both on conceptual and computational
grounds.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section §2 we present the basic elements
of the multiscale methodology, namely the Lattice Boltzmann treatment of the ﬂuid
solvent, and its coupling to a Molecular Dynamics simulation of the solute biopolymer.
In Section §3, we present an application of this multiscale methodology to the problem
of long polymer translocation through a nanopore; in particular, we analyze in detail
the role of hydrodynamics in accelerating the translocation process. In Section §4 we
elaborate on the relevance of our results to the problem of DNA translocation, which
has attracted much theoretical and experimental attention recently. We conclude in
Section §5 with general remarks and outlook for future extensions.

2. Lattice-Boltzmann - Molecular-Dynamics multiscale methodology.
We consider the generic problem of tracing the dynamic evolution of a polymer
molecule interacting with a ﬂuid solvent. This involves the simultaneous interaction
of several physical mechanisms, often acting on widely separate temporal and spatial
scales. Essentially, these interactions can be classiﬁed in three distinct categories as
solute-solute, solvent-solvent and solvent-solute. The ﬁrst category includes the con-
servative many-body interactions among the single monomers in the polymer chain.
Being atomistic in nature, these interactions usually set the shortest scale in the over-
all multiscale process. They are typically handled by Molecular Dynamics techniques
for constrained molecules. The second category, the solvent-solvent interactions, refer
to the dynamics of the solvent molecules, which are usually dealt with by a continuum
ﬂuid-mechanics approach; in the present work these will be described by the meso-
scopic Lattice Boltzmann equation. The second and third category have also been
handled by simulating the solvent explicitly via molecular dynamics, implicit solvent
particles via Brownian dynamics including hydrodynamic interactions, or solving the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation [8]. Finally, the solvent-solute dynamics will
be treated by augmenting the molecular dynamics side with dissipative ﬂuid-molecule
interactions (Langevin picture) and including the corresponding reaction terms in the
ﬂuid-kinetic equations.

2.1. Atomistic dynamics. We consider a polymer consisting of N monomer
units (also referred to as beads). The polymer is advanced in time according to the
following set of Molecular Dynamics-Langevin equations for the bead positions ~rp and

The ﬁrst term represents the conservative bead-bead interactions through a potential
which we will take to have the standard 6 − 12 Lennard-Jones form,

truncated at a distance of r=21/6σ [9]. This was combined with a harmonic part to
account for the energy cost of distorting the angular degrees of freedom,

with φ the relative angle between two consecutive bonds. Torsional motions will not
be included in the present model, but can easily be incorporated if needed.

We consider next the solute-solvent interactions. The second term on the right-
hand-side of Eq.(2.1) represents the mechanical friction between the single bead and
the surrounding ﬂuid, ~vp being the bead velocity and ~up the ﬂuid velocity evaluated
at the bead position. In addition to mechanical drag, the polymer feels the eﬀects
of stochastic ﬂuctuations of the ﬂuid environment, through the random term, ~ξp, a
Gaussian noise obeying the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relations:

< ~ξp > = 0

< ~ξ(~rp, t)~ξ(~rq, t′) > = γ(kBT /m)V δ(~rp − ~rq)δ(t − t′)

where V is the volume of the cell to which beads p and q belong. Finally, λp∂~rpκp is
the reaction force resulting from N − 1 holonomic constraints for molecules modelled
with rigid covalent bonds:

(2.9)

κp ≡ |~rp+1 − ~rp|2 − r2

0 = 0

r0 being the prescribed bond length, and {λp} is the set of N − 1 Lagrange multipli-
ers conjugated to each constraint. The usage of constraints instead of ﬂexible bond
lengths makes it possible to eliminate unimportant high-frequency intra-molecular
motion which would render the underlying LB propagation prone to numerical insta-
bilities. In this way, the time-step of the Molecular Dynamics part can be increased by
about one order of magnitude, as much as the overall eﬃciency of the LBMD method,
as we shall discuss in section §2.5. Finally, in order to avoid spurious dissipation, the

bead velocities are required to be strictly orthogonal to the relative displacements.
Given the second order atomistic dynamics, the velocities must obey the independent
constraints:

The constraints (2.9), (2.10) are enforced over positions and momenta separately via
the SHAKE [10] and the RATTLE algorithms [11]. The implementation of these con-
straints requires the iterative solution of the system of equations (2.9)-(2.10), typically
accomplished via standard Newton-Raphson techniques.

2.2. Fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann method. The Lattice Boltzmann equa-
tion is a minimal form of the Boltzmann kinetic equation in which all details of molecu-
lar motion are removed except those that are strictly needed to recover hydrodynamic
behavior at the macroscopic scale (mass-momentum and energy conservation). The
result is an elegant equation for the discrete distribution function fi(~x, t) describing
the probability to ﬁnd a particle at lattice site ~x at time t with speed ~v = ~ci. More
speciﬁcally, since we are dealing with nanoscopic ﬂows, in this work we shall consider
the ﬂuctuating Lattice Boltzmann equation which takes the following form:

(2.11)

fi(~x + ~ci∆t, t + ∆t) = fi(~x, t) − ω∆t(fi − f eq

i )(~x, t) + Fi∆t + Si∆t

where fi(~x, t) represents the probability of ﬁnding a ﬂuid particle at spatial location
~x and time t with discrete speed ~ci. The particles can only move along the links
of a regular lattice deﬁned by the discrete speeds, so that the synchronous particle
displacements ∆~xi = ~ci∆t never take the ﬂuid particles away from the lattice. For
the present study, the standard three-dimensional 19-speed lattice is used [4] (see
Figure 1). The right hand side represents the eﬀect of intermolecular solvent-solvent
collisions, through a relaxation toward local equilibrium, f eq

The diagonal component of the momentum-ﬂux tensor gives the ﬂuid pressure, while
the oﬀ-diagonal terms give the shear-stress. Unlike in hydrodynamics, both quantities
are available locally and at any point in the simulation.

follows (index notation)

(2.17)

Fi = wiρ{F (2)

ab (ciacib − β−1δab) + F (3)

where F (2) is the ﬂuctuating stress tensor (a 3 × 3 stochastic matrix). Consistency
with the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem at all scales requires the following conditions

where ∆abcd is the fourth-order Kronecker symbol [12]. F (3) is related to the ﬂuc-
tuating heat ﬂux and giabc is the corresponding basis in kinetic space, essentially a
third-order Hermite polynomial (full details are given in [13]).

The polymer-ﬂuid back reaction is described through the source term Si, which
represents the momentum input per unit time due to the reaction of the polymer on
the ﬂuid population fi:

(2.19)

Si(~x, t) = wiβ

[ ~F f

p + ~F r

p ] · ~ci

Xp∈D(x)

where D(x) denotes the mesh cell to which the pth bead belongs. The quantities on
the left hand side in the above expression have to reside on the lattice nodes, which
means that the frictional and random forces need to be extrapolated from the particle
to the grid location.

The use of a LB solver for the ﬂuid solvent is particularly well suited to this

problem because of the following reasons:
i) Free-streaming proceeds along straight trajectories. This is in stark contrast with
hydrodynamics, in which ﬂuid momentum is transported by its own space-time vary-
ing velocity ﬁeld. Besides securing exact conservation of mass and momentum of the
numerical scheme, this also greatly facilitates the imposition of geometrically complex
boundary conditions.

6

Fyta, Melchionna, Kaxiras, & Succi

ii) The pressure ﬁeld is available locally, with no need of solving any (computationally
expensive) Poisson problem for the pressure, like in standard hydrodynamics.
iii) Unlike hydrodynamics, diﬀusivity is not represented by a second-order diﬀeren-
tial operator, but it emerges instead from the ﬁrst-order LB relaxation-propagation
dynamics. The result is that the kinetic scheme can march in time-steps which scale
linearly, rather than quadratically, with the mesh resolution. This facilitates high-
resolution down-coupling to atomistic scales.
iv) Solute-solute interactions preserve their local nature since they are explicitly medi-
ated by the solvent molecules through direct solvent-solute interactions. As a result,
the computational cost of hydrodynamic interactions scales only linearly with the
length of the polymer (no long-range interactions).
v) Since all interactions are local, the LB scheme is ideally suited to parallel comput-
ing.

It is worth mentioning that more advanced Lattice Boltzmann models [14, 15]

could equally well be coupled to the atomistic dynamics.

2.3. Time exchange. The Molecular-Langevin-Dynamics solver is marched in
time with a stochastic integrator (due to extra non-conservative and random terms),
proceeding at a fraction of the LB time-step,

dt = ∆t/M

The time-step ratio M > 1 controls the scale separation between the solvent and
solute timescales.

The numerical solution of the stochastic equations is performed by means of a
modiﬁed version of the Langevin Impulse propagation scheme, derived from the as-
sumption that the systematic forces are constant between consecutive time steps [16].
The propagation of the unconstrained dynamics proceeds according to the scheme

particularly suitable for our purposes since it is second order accurate in time and
robust, that is, it reduces to the symplectic Verlet algorithm for γ → 0. Moreover, at
variance with the original Langevin Impulse scheme, the modiﬁed propagator allows
for an unambiguous deﬁnition of velocities, which are needed to couple the polymer
to the hydrodynamic ﬁeld of the surrounding solvent. The particle positions and
velocities corrected via the SHAKE and RATTLE algorithms read ~r⋆
p(t + dt) → ~rp(t +
dt) and ~v⋆
p(t + dt) → ~vp(t + dt). For consistency, in considering the momentum
exchange with the solvent the corrected velocities appear in the friction forces. The
MD cycle is repeated M times, with the hydrodynamic ﬁeld frozen at time tn = n∆t.

2.4. Spatial exchange. The transfer of spatial information from/to grid to/from
particle locations is performed at each LB time-stamp tn = n∆t. To this purpose,on
account of its simplicity, a simple nearest grid point (NGP) interpolation scheme is

worth emphasizing that, while LB and MD with Langevin dynamics have been cou-
pled before, notably in the study of single-polymer dynamics [19], to the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time such that coupling is put in place for long molecules
of biological interest.

2.5. Eﬃciency considerations. The total cost of the computation scales roughly

like

(2.21)

t ∼ (tLBV + tMDM N )NLB

where tLB is the CPU time required to update a single LB site per timestep and
tMD is the CPU time to update a single bead per timestep, V is the volume of the
computational domain in lattice units and N is the number of polymer beads, with
M the LB-MD time-step ratio. Finally, NLB is the number of LB timesteps. In the
above equation, tMD includes the overhead of LB-MD coupling. Note that tMD is
largely independent of N because i) the LB-MD coupling is local, ii) the forces are
short ranged and iii) the SHAKE/RATTLE algorithms are empirically known to scale
linearly with the number of constraints.

Regarding the cost of the LB section, this is known to scale linearly with the
volume occupied by the solvent. For the case where polymer concentration is kept
constant, the volume needed to accommodate a polymer of N beads should scale
approximately as N 1.8; however, for translocation studies such as those discussed
later in this paper, we shall consider a box of given volume, independently on the
polymer length.

From the above expression it is clear that M should be chosen as small as possible,
consistent with the requirement of providing a realistic description of the polymer dy-
namics. In the present simulation we typically choose M between 5 and 20, depending

8

Fyta, Melchionna, Kaxiras, & Succi

on the parameters of the simulation, particularly the temperature. This means that
we are taking the LB representation close to the molecular scale. We will return to
this important issue in the quantitative discussion of the physical application.

A tentative estimate of the computational cost proceeds as follows: Assuming
250 ﬂops/site/LB-step and 2500 ﬂops/bead/MD-step (including the LB-MD coupling
overhead), and an eﬀective processing speed of 100 Mﬂop/s, the evolution over 30, 000
LB steps=150, 000 MD steps of a typical 80×40×40 grid and 400 beads set-up, would
take about:

t = 30, 000 ×

250 × (80 × 40 × 4) + 2500 × 5 × 400

(cid:2)

/108 = (9600 + 1500)sec ∼ 3hrs,
(cid:3)

which is in reasonable agreement with the simulation time observed with the present
version of the code (7hrs), including the relative MD/LB cost (≃ 1 : 4).

We wish to emphasize that the key feature of the LB-MD approach, namely
linear scaling of the CPU cost with the number of beads (at constant volume) is
indeed observed. In fact, the execution times for 50, 100 and 400 beads are 0.433,
0.489, and 0.882 sec/step, respectively on a 2GHz AMD Opteron processor. By
excluding hydrodynamics, these numbers become 0.039, 0.075, and 0.318 sec/step. It
is worth mentioning that thus far, no eﬀort has been directed to code optimization; it
is quite possible that careful optimization may lower the execution time by an order
of magnitude.

2.6. Validation tests. The static and dynamic behavior of the DNA chain
obtained by our methodology has been compared to the scaling predictions for a single
i,jheik·(ri−rj )i,
chain at inﬁnite dilution. Given the structure factor Sf (k) = 1
N
standard theory predicts the scaling law Sf (k) = N g(kRg), where g(y) is a universal
i,jh(ri − rj)2i is the gyration radius. For large k, the
function and Rg = (1/2N 2)
structure factor is independent of N , and it follows

P

P

Sf (k) ∝ k−1/µ

where experiments, theory and simulations agree on the scaling exponent value µ ≃
0.584. The static scaling law is not aﬀected by the presence of hydrodynamics. How-
ever, veriﬁcation of the scaling law and attainment of the scaling regime for large
enough chains is a good check for the correctness of our simulation scheme and for
the subsequent validation of the hydrodynamic behavior.

The dynamic behavior of the chain is deeply aﬀected by the presence of hy-
drodynamic interactions. The standard picture of polymer dynamics is based on
the Rouse (no hydrodynamics) or Zimm (hydrodynamic) description in terms of an
underlying gaussian chain. In this case, the chain intermediate scattering function
IS(k, t) =

i,jheik·[ri(t)−rj(0)]i should follow the universal behavior

where ˜g(y) is another universal function and Df is the center of mass diﬀusion con-
stant. Having introduced the dynamic scaling exponent µ′ via Df ∼ N µ
, the expo-
nent x is found to be x = 2 + µ′/µ. According to Zimm theory, µ′ = µ and x = 3 [19]
while, according to Molecular Dynamics simulations, it appears that the actual value
is somehow lower, i.e. x ≃ 2.9 [20].

[21] (σ = 0.65, ǫ/kBT = 1.0, bond length r0 = 0.945) in a simulation box of edge
60. This choice was motivated to verify the range of scaling behavior as compared
to previous numerical results. We have computed the structure factor, as reported in
Fig.3(a), and observed that the scaling regime is clearly visible for 1 < k < 3 with
an exponent equal µ = 0.58 ± 0.1. In the range of k vectors where the static scaling
holds, the dynamic scaling has been checked by considering, for given values of the
computed scattering function, the loci of points t(k, IS) = ˜g−1(IS)k−x and by ﬁtting
via a power law curve (see ref. [20] for details). As illustrated in Fig.3(b), the resulting
scaling exponent is found to be x = 2.9±0.1, in excellent agreement with the expected
value and similar to previous simulation results on single polymers surrounded by a
Lattice Boltzmann ﬂuid [21]. Moreover, by applying a heuristic argument [20], we
have veriﬁed that within the scaling regime, the ﬁnite size of the periodic box was not
biasing the data.

3. Application: polymer translocation through nanopore. The scheme
described above is general and applicable to any situation where a long polymer is
moving in a solvent. This motion is of great interest for a fundamental understanding
of polymer dynamics in the presence of the solvent. For example, the translocation of a
polymer through a pore of very small size (of order the separation between monomers),
is a process in which the coupling of the molecular motion to the solvent dynamics
may be of crucial signiﬁcance. In this section, we will therefore provide a detailed
discussion of the polymer dynamics in the presence of a solvent for the example of
translocation through a nanopore but without reference to a speciﬁc physical system.
In the next section we explore the relevance of these results to DNA translocation
through a nanopore.

3.1. Initial and Boundary conditions. The polymer is initialized via a stan-
dard self-avoiding random walk algorithm and further relaxed to equilibrium by stan-
dard Molecular Dynamics. The solvent is initialized with the equilibrium distribution
corresponding to a constant density ρ0 and zero macroscopic speed ~u = 0.

Boundary conditions for the ﬂuid are periodic at inlet/outlet sections, and zero-
speed at rigid walls, using the standard bounce-back rule [4]. For the polymer, period-
icity is again imposed at inlet/outlet, whereas the interaction with rigid walls is han-

dled by a Lennard-Jones potential with speciﬁc wall-polymer parameters σwall = 1.5
and ǫwall = 10−3 in LB units. The connection between slip-ﬂow at the wall and
intermolecular solid-ﬂuid interactions shall be the objects of future research.

3.2. Numerical set-up. We consider a three-dimensional box of size Nxh ×
Nyh × Nzh lattice units, with h the spacing between lattice points. We will take
Nx = 2Ny, Ny = Nz; the separating wall is located in the mid-section of the x
direction, at x = hNx/2 with Nx = 80. At t = 0 the polymer resides entirely in the
right chamber at x > hNx/2. At the center of the separating wall, a square hole of side
dhole = 2h is opened, through which the polymer can translocate from one chamber
to the other. Translocation is induced by a constant electric ﬁeld which acts along
the x direction, and is conﬁned in a rectangular channel of size 2h × h × h along the
streamline (x direction) and cross-ﬂow (y, z directions). The spatial coarse-graining
is such that the presence of the solvent as well as electrostatic forces acting due to
charges on the polymer are neglected altogether as being of secondary importance
compared to hydrodynamics.

Here and throughout we work in lattice Boltzmann units, in which length and
time are measured in units of the lattice spacing h = ∆x and time-step ∆t, respec-
tively. Mass is deﬁned as m = mLBmsol. The dimensionless mass mLB used in the
simulations is set to unity, which means that mass is measured in units of the solvent
mass msol. This choice is not restrictive since the present approach is used to model
incompressible ﬂows in which density is a parameter which can be rescaled by any
arbitrary factor. However, it is of some interest to estimate the number of solvent
molecules represented by a single LB computational molecule, since the inverse of
this number conveys a measure of the importance of statistical ﬂuctuations at the
scale of the lattice spacing ∆x. Let SN be this number, which will be deﬁned as
ρsolh
, where ρLB is the dimensionless density used in the LB simulations. In order
ρLB msol
for the Boltzmann probability distribution to make sense as a statistical observable,
NLB >> 1. For typical values of ρsol = 1 gr/cm3, msol ∼ 20 amu, ρLB = 1 (which
correspond to water), and h in the range 1 − 102 nm, this yields SN ∼ 104 − 106.
This shows that the neglect of many-body ﬂuctuations inherent to the single-particle
Boltzmann representation is still justiﬁed even at the nanoscopic scale of the lattice
spacing.

We will focus here on the fast translocation regime, in which the translocation
time tX is much smaller than the Zimm time, tZ, i.e. the typical relaxation time of
the polymer towards its native (minimum energy, maximum entropy) conﬁguration.
Under fast-translocation conditions, the many-body aspects of the polymer dynamics
cannot be ignored because diﬀerent beads along the chain do not move indepen-
dently. As a result, simple one-dimensional Brownian models do not apply [22]. In
addition to many-body solute-solute interactions, the present approach also takes full
account of many-body solute-solvent hydrodynamic interactions. The conditions for
fast-translocation regime can be appraised as follows. The translocation time is esti-
mated by equating the driving force, Fpull, to the drag force exerted by a solvent with
dynamic viscosity η on a polymer with radius of gyration R, Fdrag ∼ 6πηR
. This
tX
. Since the Zimm time is given by tZ ∼ 0.4ηR
yields tX ∼ 6πηR
kB T , the fast-translocation
Fpull
condition tX ≪ tZ becomes:

length is in the range 20 ≤ N ≤ 400 beads.
It can be readily checked that by
assuming R ∼ N 0.6 our set of parameters falls safely within the fast translocation
regime. However, for kBT /m = 10−3, FpullR/kBT is of the order of 102 − 103 which
is much closer to breaking the above condition.

the order of ∼ 100∆t. Thus, by choosing M = 5 as a time-gap factor, we obtain
dt ∼ τLJ /500, which is adequate for the resolution of the polymer dynamics. The
solvent is set at a density ρ = 1, with a kinematic viscosity ν = 0.1∆x2/∆t and a
damping coeﬃcient γ = 0.1/∆t. The ﬂexional rigidity κ for the angular potential
between beads will be 10−4/rad.
In order to resolve the structure of the solvent
accurately on the atomistic scale [23], we should use a higher resolution of at least 3-4
orders of magnitude. This means resolving the radial structure of the pore, a task that
can only be undertaken by resorting to parallel computing. It is nonetheless hoped,
and veriﬁed a posteriori, that this artiﬁcial magniﬁcation does not aﬀect adversely
the most signiﬁcant dynamical and statistical properties of the translocation process,
by which we mean that eventually, the time-scale of the simulated process may not be
the same as in the physical process of interest, but the simulated dynamics is related
to the physical dynamics by a simple rescaling of the time variable.

3.3. Translocation time. The most immediate quantity of interest in the translo-

cation process is the dependence of the translocation time on the polymer length. This
is usually expressed by a scaling law of the form

τX (N ) ≡ tx/dt = N α

where t0 is a reference time-scale, formally the translocation time of a single monomer,
and α a scaling exponent measuring the degree of competition (α > 1) / cooperation
(α < 1) of the various monomers in the chain.

We ﬁrst turn to the derivation of the scaling behavior of the translocation pro-
cess in the case where hydrodynamic interactions are included. In order to take into
account the statistical nature of the phenomenon, simulations of a large number of
translocation events (100 up to 1000) for each polymer length were carried out. The
ensemble of simulations is generated by diﬀerent realizations of the initial polymer
conﬁguration. The duration histograms were constructed by cumulating all events
for various lengths. Overall, our results are quite similar to the corresponding ex-
perimental data for DNA translocation through a nanopore [24], which we discuss in
more detail in the following section.

At a next step, our data were shifted and scaled so that the distribution curve
starts at zero-time and the total probability is equal to unity. The resulting distri-
butions are on average not gaussians, but skewed towards long translocation times,
consistent with experiment [24]. Therefore, the translocation time for each length is
not assigned to the mean time, but to the most probable time, which is the position of
the maximum in the histogram. In Fig.4 the distribution of all the events for polymer
sizes N=50, 100 and 300 are shown. In this ﬁgure, the most probable translocation
time for each length is denoted by an arrow. From this analysis, a nonlinear relation
between the most probable translocation time τ0 and the polymer length is obtained
that follows closely the theoretically expected scaling τX (N ) ∼ N α, with α ∼ 1.29
(see Fig.4).

dynamics. The straight line represents the power law with exponent 1.29. Time is shown in units
of the LB timestep ∆t.

3.4. Dynamics with and without a solvent. A closer inspection into the
polymer dynamics reveals some interesting features. The molecule shows a blob-like
conformation on either side of the membrane as it moves through the hole. It may
either translocate very fast or move from one chamber to the other intermittently, with
pauses. Both types of events are present with and without a ﬂuid solvent. In addition,
a careful analysis of all the translocated chains unravels the diﬀerence between slower
and faster translocation within the same fast translocation regime. The nature of the
variations in time is connected to the random ﬂuctuations of the polymer throughout
its motion, rather than the temperature or its length. These ﬂuctuations are correlated
to the entropic forces (gradient of the free energy with respect to a conformational
order parameter, typically the fraction of translocated beads, see r(t) below) acting
on both translocated and untranslocated parts of the polymer. In fact, when a solvent
is present, the interplay between these forces and Fdrag, Fpull determines the motion
and the shape of the chain and thereby the translocation time. At some point part
of the chain shapes up in an almost linear conformation increasing in this way the
entropic force acting on it. This eventually leads to deceleration of the whole chain.
Fig.6 shows an illustration of this argument, where a polymer chain, surrounded by a
solvent is represented at a time where it starts to slow down. In this ﬁgure, a polymer
with the same length but diﬀerent initial conﬁguration is also shown at the same time.

events. Both snapshots are shown at a timestep where the polymer (b) starts to slow down (see
arrow in Fig.7). Fpull is applied at the hole region towards a direction indicated by the arrow.

It is very instructive to monitor the progress in time of the number of translo-
cated monomers N (t). Note that r(t) ≡ N (t)/N serves as a reaction-coordinate,
with the translocation time deﬁned by the condition r(tX ) = 1. The translocated
monomers for processes with and without hydrodynamics are shown in Fig.7. For the
former, events related to the polymers of Fig.6 are shown (curves A1, A3), as well
as that related to the most probable time (A2). The arrow in this ﬁgure indicates
the timestep corresponding to the snapshots in Fig.6. The translocation for a given
polymer proceeds along a curve virtually related to its initial conﬁguration and its
interactions with the ﬂuid. It is clearly visible that there is no general trend. The
non-hydrodynamic case is in principle diﬀerent, especially in terms of the time range
which is larger. This reveals the importance of hydrodynamic coherence.

Additional insight into the dynamics is obtained by altering the parameter set.
This has not yet been extensively explored, but it was found that a choice of kBT =
10−5, Fpull = 0.01, and ǫ = 0.002 leads to the frequent retraction of the polymer.
In other words, after having translocated a large fraction of its length, the polymer
occasionally reverses its motion and anti-translocates away from the hole, never to ﬁnd
its way back into it. Moreover, we ﬁnd that a polymer that retracted in the presence
of a solvent, manages to fully translocate if the solvent is absent. It is interesting
to observe that, in principle, no such type of anti-translocating behavior has been
observed for short polymers. This indicates that hydrodynamics signiﬁcantly speed-up
and alter the nature of translocation, especially for long polymers at low temperatures.
This highly irregular dynamics escapes any scaling or statistical analysis, as well as
dynamic Monte Carlo simulations [25], and can only be revealed by self-consistent
many-body hydro-dynamic simulations.

4. DNA translocation through a nanopore. The translocation of biopoly-
mers, such as DNA and RNA plays a major role in many important biological pro-
cesses, such as viral infection by phages, inter-bacterial DNA transduction, and gene
therapy [26]. The importance of this process has spawned a number of in vitro exper-
iments, aimed at exploring the translocation process through micro-fabricated chan-

Curves A1, A3 correspond to slow and fast translocation events (polymers shown in Fig.5), while

nels under the eﬀects of an external electric ﬁeld, or through protein channels across
cellular membranes [27]. In particular, recent experimental work has focused on the
possibility of fast DNA-sequencing by reading the base sequence as the polymer passes
through a nanopore. Some universal features of DNA translocation can be analyzed
by means of suitably simpliﬁed statistical schemes [28] and non-hydrodynamic coarse-
grained or microscopic models [29, 30]. However, a quantitative description of this
complex phenomenon calls for state-of-the art modeling of the type described above.
Accordingly, we explore here to what extent the results discussed above for the generic
situation of polymer translocation apply to the DNA case.

First, we note that, as already mentioned in the previous section, our results are
quite similar to the experimental data for DNA translocation through a nanopore
[24]. Three diﬀerent interpretations of the current model are physically plausible:
(a) Following the framework used in recent studies of DNA packing in bacteriophages
[31], one monomer in our simulation can be thought of as representing a DNA segment
of about 8 base-pairs, that is, each bead has a diameter of 2.5 nm, the hydrated
diameter of B-DNA in physiological conditions.
(b) It is also physically plausible to assume that a bead represents a portion of DNA
equivalent to its persistence length of about 50 nm, which translates into mapping
one bead to ∼150 base-pairs.
(c) Alternatively, as is typically done in simulations of the λ-phage DNA in solution
[32], one bead can be taken to correspond to ∼ 103 base-pairs.
In all three cases h = ∆x is equal to the bead size, while the pore, having a width of
2∆x, will be diﬀerent from the pores used experimentally, either smaller or larger. In
addition, the coarse graining model that handles the DNA molecules indicates that
the MD timescale is stretched over the physical process. A direct comparison between
our probability distributions for polymer translocation and the experimental results
sets a diﬀerent MD timestep for the cases (a), (b), and (c) which is of the order of 3

nsec, 100 nsec and 5 µsec, respectively, leading to a LB timestep ∆t = 5dt of 15 nsec,
500 nsec, and 25 µsec. It is diﬃcult at this stage to assign a unique interpretation of
our model in relation to a physical system. A thorough exploration of the parameter
space is required before such an assignment can be made convincingly. This is beyond
the scope of the present work but will be reported in future publications.

A second encouraging comparison is that the scaling we found for the translo-
cation time with polymer length (with exponent α = 1.29) is quite close to the
experimental measurement for DNA translocation [24] (α = 1.27 ± 0.03). Beyond
the apparent consistency between experiment and theory, additional insight can be
gained by analyzing the polymer dynamics during translocation.

A hydrodynamic picture of DNA translocation has been presented in ref.
[24].
In this work, the authors assume that the electric ﬁeld drive is in balance with the
Stokes drag exerted by the solvent on the blob conﬁguration of the polymer, that is

Fpull = 6πρν

dR2
U
τ

where ρ is the density, ν the kinematic viscocity, τ the translocation time, and RU
the translocated part of the radius of gyration. In order for this balance to apply at
all times, it is clear that R2 must be constant in time, hence it cannot be identiﬁed
neither with the translocated nor with the untraslocated gyration radius of DNA.
To this end, in Fig.8 we represent the time-evolution of the radii of gyration for the
two sections of DNA, RU (t) and RT (t), the untranslocated (U ) [with x > hNx/2]
and translocated (T ) [with x < hNx/2] parts, respectively.
In order to identify a
time-invariant radius, we deﬁne the RI (t) = QN ζ
I (t), where I = U, T stands for
the untranslocated and translocated parts and NI (t) is the corresponding number of
monomers. The exponent ζ ∼ 0.6 is the same as previously noted and Q is a constant
(for long enough polymers). If translocation could be described by the dynamics of a
single-blob object, characterized by an eﬀective radius of gyration, deﬁned as

RE(t) = cN ζ(t),

16

(4.1)

Fyta, Melchionna, Kaxiras, & Succi

then this quantity should be constant in time. Since the N = NT (t) + NU (t) holds
for all t, the above relations lead to

RE(t) = [R1/ζ

T (t) + R1/ζ

U (t)]ζ = const

I

We focus ﬁrst on the case without hydrodynamics, Fig.8(a). For very small chains
RI (t) does not scale as N 0.6
and the deﬁnition for RE is not valid at the ﬁrst and
last ∼ 15 − 20% parts of the event, during which the untranslocated and the translo-
cated parts, respectively, are small. Outside these limits, RE(t) as obtained from the
deﬁnition (4.1), with the values of RU (t), RT (t) directly taken from the simulations,
is indeed approximately constant. In addition, the values RT (t = tX ) and RU (t = 0)
do not coincide, since the former is lower than the latter. This is also the case when
a solvent is present, Fig.8(b). Thus, regardless of the dynamic pathway and the dif-
ferent conformations the chain may possess during translocation, once the event is
completed the polymer is more compact than at t = 0. Comparison of the cases with
and without hydrodynamics reveals that in the latter case the polymer becomes up
to ∼ 7% more conﬁned than when a solvent is added. The untranslocated part of the
radius of gyration at the end of the process shows an abrupt drop. As a consequence
the polymer t = tX does not fully recover its initial volume.
It it plausible, that
by allowing the polymer to further advance in time, RT (t = tX ) will become similar
to RU (t = t0), but this remains to be examined. Nevertheless, in this work we have
been interested mainly on the chain dynamics related to the ﬁrst passage times, which
correspond to the exact period of time needed until all the beads have translocated.

5. Conclusions. We have presented a multiscale methodology based on the con-
current coupling of constrained molecular dynamics for the solute biopolymers with a
lattice Boltzmann treatment of solvent dynamics. Owing to the dual ﬁeld-particle na-
ture of the Lattice Boltzmann technique, this coupling proceeds seamlessy in time and
only requires standard interpolation/extrapolation for information-transfer in phys-
ical space. This multiscale methodology has been applied to the case of polymer
translocation through a nanopore, with special emphasis on the role of hydrodynamic
coherence on the dynamic and statistical properties of the translocation process. It is
found that hydrodynamic interactions play a major role in accelerating the translo-
cation process, especially for long molecules at low temperature.

An attempt to connect these results to the process of DNA translocation through
a nanopore revealed certain similarities with experiment, especially in the scaling
law of the translocation time with polymer length. The presence of hydrodynamic
interactions lead to a decrease in the translocation times, compared to the cases
without a ﬂuid solvent. Inspection of the variation of the translocated beads and the
radii of gyration with time reveals interesting aspects of the DNA dynamics during
translocation.

Future directions for the simulations include the detailed study of the eﬀects of
temperature, ﬁnite-length and geometrical details of the nanopore geometry, as well as
electrostatic interactions of the DNA molecule with the surrounding ﬂuid. To this end,
resort to parallel computing is mandatory, and we expect the favourable properties of
LB towards parallel implementations to greatly facilitate the task. Work along these
lines is currently in progress.

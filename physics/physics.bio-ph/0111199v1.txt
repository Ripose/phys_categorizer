High-density oligonucleotide arrays are among the most rapidly expanding technologies in biology
today. In the GeneChip system, the reconstruction of the target concentration depends upon the
diﬀerential signal generated from hybridizing the target RNA to two nearly identical templates: a
perfect match (PM) and a single mismatch (MM) probe. It has been observed that a large fraction
of MM probes repeatably bind targets better than the PMs, against the usual expectation from
sequence-speciﬁc hybridization; this is diﬃcult to interpret in terms of the underlying physics. We
examine this problem via a statistical analysis of a large set of microarray experiments. We classify
the probes according to their signal to noise (S/N ) ratio, deﬁned as the eccentricity of a (PM, MM)
pair’s ‘trajectory’ across many experiments. Of those probes having large S/N (> 3) only a fraction
behave consistently with the commonly assumed hybridization model. Our results imply that the
physics of DNA hybridization in microarrays is more complex than expected, and they suggest new
ways of constructing estimators for the target RNA concentration.

Interest in the detailed physics of DNA hybridization is
rooted in both purely theoretical and practical reasons.
Studies of the denaturing transition started with mod-
els of perfectly homogeneous DNA [1], soon followed by
studies of sequence-speciﬁc disorder [2, 3, 4]. The speci-
ﬁcity with which DNA binds to its exact complement
as opposed to a mismatched copy (a “defect”) has been
studied experimentally [5, 6] and theoretically [7, 8, 9].
In this context it has been found that a fair fraction of
the energetics of DNA hybridization is related to stacking
interactions between ﬁrst-neighbor bases, in addition to
the obvious strand-strand contact [10, 11]. In this paper
we present a study of mismatch hybridization stemming
from a very practical problem, hybridization in DNA mi-
croarrays. We shall show experimental evidence that the
system displays behavior which appears to be hard to ac-
count for on the basis of the extant view of hybridization
speciﬁcities.

DNA microarrays provide an experimental technique
for measuring thousands of individual mRNA concentra-
tions present in a given target mixture. They are made
by depositing DNA oligonucleotide sequences (probes) at
speciﬁc locations on solid substrates. The probes can be
either pre-made sequences as in cDNA spotted arrays, or
they can be grown in situ, letter by letter, as in high-
density oligonucleotide arrays [12]. The target mRNA is
ampliﬁed (into either cDNA or cRNA depending on the
protocol) and the product labeled ﬂuorecently before be-
ing hybridized onto the array. The spatial distribution
of ﬂuorescence is then measured using a laser, provid-
ing estimates for the target concentrations. In GeneChip
arrays, the synthesis of probe sequences by photolitho-
graphic techniques requires a number of diﬀerent masks
and deposition processes per added base, making it im-
practical to grow more than a few dozen nucleotides. For
such lengths, hybridization speciﬁcity is not expected to

be high enough. To solve this conundrum, GeneChip
technology is based on a two-fold approach, involving re-
dundancy and diﬀerential signal [12, 13, 14]. First, sev-
eral diﬀerent sequence snippets (each 25 bases long) are
used to probe a single transcript; and second, each of
these probes comes in two ﬂavors. The perfect match
(PM) is perfectly complementary to a portion of the tar-
get sequence whereas the single mismatch (MM) carries
a substitution to the complementary base at its middle
(13th) position. The rationale behind MM sequences
is that they are expected to probe for non-speciﬁc hy-
bridization in a manner that we shall detail below.

In current incarnations of the chips, each gene is
probed by 14-20 (PM,MM) pairs (a probeset), and the
task is therefore to reconstruct a single number (the
target concentration) from these 28-40 measurements.
There are conceivably many ways in which this can be
done, with various degrees of noise rejection. The stan-
dard algorithm provided in the software suite [15] of-
fers one method. However, as independent experimen-
tal techniques for measuring mRNA concentrations (like
northern blots) provided clues that the analysis process
should be improved upon, many researchers attempted
to do so; it was then discovered that a fair number of
MM probes consistently report higher ﬂuorescence signal
than their PM counterpart [16]. This observation is most
intriguing because it violates the standard hybridization
model as outlined below. Thus, the notion that the spe-
ciﬁc binding signal alone can be obtained as a diﬀerential
of the PM and MM signals appears to fail in a subset of
the probes.

We shall show below that it is not a matter of a few
stray probes, by carefully examining the statistics of PM-
MM pairs. These statistics show that most of the probes
misbehave to various degrees. Only a fraction of them,
having M M > P M , exhibit a ﬂagrant violation of the

basic assumptions, however, these just point most obvi-
ously at the symptoms of a deeper problem which aﬀects
all probes. Given the number of laboratories who are
currently carrying out such hybridization experiments,
squeezing out even a meager extra bit of signal to noise
ratio from the data would be very valuable. It has be-
come clear that this shall not happen in the absence of
a better understanding of DNA hybridization to slightly
mismatched templates. We shall now attempt the ﬁrst
step toward this goal, which is to characterize the prob-
lem.

a background of physical origin, i.e. the photodetector
dark current or light reﬂections from the scanning pro-
cess. Then α is the reduction of speciﬁc binding due to
the single mismatch. These brightnesses are related to
the quantity of interest (the RNA concentration in the
sample) through:

IS = k [S]
IN S = h [N S]

where [S] denotes the concentration of target RNA, [N S]
the concentration of whatever mixture contributes to the
nonspeciﬁc hybridization. k and h are probe dependent
speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc susceptibilities (possibly concen-
tration dependent) and include eﬀects such as the areal
density of probe, various aﬃnities, transcript length de-
pendent eﬀects (longer transcripts are likely to carry
more ﬂuorophors depending on the labeling technique).
While it is no secret that the physics of hybridiza-
tion is way more complex than this simplistic model,
one could still hope that it would essentially provide a
correct picture of GeneChip hybridizations. To summa-
rize, let us outline the basic assumptions made so far: (i)
non-speciﬁc binding is identical in PM and MM, meaning
that IN S does not see the letter change; (ii) α > 0; (iii)
k and h identical for PM and MM; (iv) k, h and α are
reasonably uniform numbers across a probe set. Notice
that (i)+(ii) imply that P M > M M always (see below).
M M is not used as such, the background B
needs to be subtracted from the intensities, which can be
done in a statistically proper way as described in [16].

If P M

According to the basic tenets of the standard model,
it follows that P M > M M for all probe pairs if the tar-
get RNA extract contains no sequences matching exactly
the MM. In reality, one observes a vast number of probe
pairs for which this assumption is violated; this behav-
ior repeats consistently for a broad range of conditions.
Our experience is that most people in the know think
of this problem in terms of an imperfect adherence to
the standard model, or a bothersome deviation from an
otherwise properly behaving norm. In other words, the
way this problem is usually characterized is ”there’s a
number of probe pairs that don’t work and we don’t un-
derstand why”. We shall show now that this is not so:
the M M > P M pairs are so abundant that we like to
propose the alternate view that the model is simply in-
adequate for describing what actually happens, and that
we do not understand the basic physics of MM hybridiza-
tion. Table 1 summarizes the statistics for various chip
series.

The human HG-U95A chip series, for instance, has ˜
400K probes for 12K diﬀerent probesets. Across a wide
variety of conditions, we have observed approximately
30% of all probe pairs have M M > P M . This ﬁgure, by
itself enormous, would be easy to dismiss if most of them
were in the low intensity range, where noise is expected
to be relatively higher and could conceivably be bigger
than
, or if they were clustered in a small

all probesets have at least 1 probe pair with M M >
P M , and still 60% of probesets have 5 such probe pairs
out of 16. In addition, the M M > P M pairs are fairly
distributed with respect to brightness (cf. Fig. 1).

What could conceivably be the source for observing
M M > P M ? A perplexing extra bit of information lies
in a simple statistic, the joint probability distribution
P (log P M, log M M ). According to the standard model,

for high brightness. Fig.
1 shows something quite
otherwise: as brightness increases, the joint probability
distribution forks into two branches. The crest of the
lower one lies fully below the M M = P M diagonal.

The characteristic shapes of P (log P M, log M M ) are
likely signatures of sequence-dependent eﬀects. However,
any hypothesis is impossible to verify as the probe se-
quences are not released to the public. Nevertheless,
there are some obvious suspects. First, the nontrivial
susceptibilities k and h mentioned above depend on the
areal density of probe, which is sequence-dependent by
virtue of the varying eﬃciencies of the lithography pro-
cess. Secondly, nucleic acids need to unstack the single-
stranded probes in order to form each new duplex as
they hybridize. Further, stacking energies are extremely
sensitive to sequence details, which might result in large
energy barriers. This would translate into kinetics con-
stants that vary exponentially (`a la Arrhenius) in these
energies, and lead to important consequences as the hy-
bridization reactions are not carried to full thermody-
namic equilibrium.

Given a set of N experiments, further insight can be
obtained by following a pair ~Pi = (log P Mi, log M Mi)
with i = 1, . . . , N across the entire dataset (after sub-
tracting B). Ideally, these points would fall on a curve
parametrizable by the mRNA concentration. In reality,
however, the observed patterns range from nearly one-
dimensional to almost circular clouds. To classify probes,
we computed the center of mass CM and inertia tensor

Fig. 2 illustrate the distribution of center of mass after
diﬀerent ﬁltering for e and λ1. It turns out that Fig. 2a
looks very similar to Fig. 1, which is not a priori evi-
dent. On the contrary, this similarity emphasizes that
most probes behave in a very reproducible manner. For
instance, probes lying below the P M = M M diagonal
at the high-intensity end do so in essentially all of the
86 experiments (leading to a CM that is also below the
diagonal), instead of visiting diﬀerent regions of the plot.
Another striking result is that (i) selecting for e > 3
eliminates most of the low-intensity probes (Fig. 2b),
(ii) the remaining set contains two components: one con-
sisting of the large λ1 probes (Fig. 2c) lying mostly in
the P M > M M region; and the small λ2 component
forming an almost perfectly symmetric “tulip” structure
(Fig. 2d), containing two forked branches plus the button
described in Fig. 1.

Another troubling eﬀect which deeply aﬀects attempts
at analysis is the very broad brightness distributions
within probes belonging to the same gene. Fig. 4 shows
that the P M probe intensities span up to four decades.
Possible reasons for such behavior are again sequence spe-
ciﬁc eﬀect similar to those discussed in the context of the
MM behavior.

FIG. 3: Relative P M intensity distributions within probe-
sets (after subtracting B). The data shows the 86 HG-
U95A human chips used previously. Probesets are split into
three groups according to their median PM intensity. In all
cases, the distributions of P M/median(P M ) span up to four
decades. Notice there are signs of saturation in the right tail
of the high-intensity set.

The main practical challenge is reconstructing the tar-
get mRNA concentration from the probeset data. As we
showed, the variability in the hybridization properties of
the probes is larger than naively anticipated, therefore,
it is unlikely that a single deﬁnitive procedure will be ap-
propriate in all cases. On the contrary, it is desirable to
have several analysis tools at hand for viewing the data
from diﬀerent angles. For instance, as a consequence of
the strongly probe dependent susceptibilities α, k and h,
the diﬀerential P M
M M will not consistently be a good
estimator of the true signal. Given the unclear informa-
tion contained in the M M , one alternative we studied
is not considering them at all. The mRNA expression
level is then obtained from a robust geometric average
of the PM-B values, after a careful estimation of B [16].
The use of geometric averages (rather that arithmetic) is
dictated by the distributions in Fig. 4. Of course, using
only PM probes neglects cross-hybridization eﬀects that
would be detectable by a working MM probe, and hence

−

tends to be less sensitive at the low-intensity end. One
the other hand, it allows to rescue probesets with a high
number of misbehaving MMs.

i = (log P M j

A completely diﬀerent approach, closer in spirit to the
model-based method [17], would be to extend the ellip-
soid of inertia idea to the the full probeset. Concretely,
i , log M M j
one would take the matrix Aj

(j = 1, . . . , Np is the probe and i the experiment in-
dex) and do a principal component analysis to iden-
tify the modes carrying the most signal. After singular

liminary testing of the method has lead to very promising
results.

In conclusion, we showed that the hybridization of
short length DNA sequences to single mismatched tem-
plates exhibits a far more diverse picture than what is
usually assumed. These observations do not only point
at interesting physics in the DNA hybridization process
to short sequences with defects, attached to a glass sur-
face; they also have strong consequences for designers of
GeneChip analysis tools, especially when it comes to the
level of noise rejection of diﬀerent methods. We hope this
will bolster interest in the physics of hybridization and
mismatch characterization.

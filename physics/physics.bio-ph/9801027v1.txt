The quantum enveloping algebra Uq(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)) in the limit q → 0 is proposed as a sym-
metry algebra for the genetic code. In this approach the triplets of nucleotids or codons in the
DNA chain are classiﬁed in crystal bases, tensor product of Uq→0(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)) representations.
Such a construction might be compared to the baryon classiﬁcation from quark building blocks
in elementary particles physics, one of the main diﬀerences standing in the property of a crystal
base to provide a natural order in the state constituents, this order being crucial in the codon.
Then an operator ensuring the correspondence codon/amino-acid can be constructed out of the
above algebra. It will be called the reading operator, and be such that two codons relative to
the same (resp. diﬀerent) amino-acid(s) acquire the same (resp. diﬀerent) eigenvalue(s).

The mystery of the perfect correspondence between triplets of nucleotides or codons in the des-
oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence and the amino-acids is called the genetic code [1]. Let us, in

a few words, remind how the DNA conducts the synthesis of proteins, which constitute the most
abundant organic substances in living matter systems. Indeed, the DNA macromolecule is made of

two linear chains of nucleotides in the famous double helix structure. Each nucleotide is character-
ized by one of the four elementary bases: adenine (A) and guanine (G) deriving from purine, and
cytosine (C) and thymine (T) coming from pyrimidine. The DNA is localized in the nucleus of the

cell and the transmission of the genetic information in the cytoplasm is achieved by the messenger
ribonucleic acid or mRNA. This operation is called the transcription, the A, G, C, T bases in the

DNA being respectively associated to the U, C, G, A bases, U denoting the uracile base. Finally, a
codon is an ordered sequence of three bases (e.g. AAG, ACG, etc.) and it is a simple exercise to
numerate 4 × 4 × 4 diﬀerent codons. Except the three following triplets UAA, UAG and UGA, each
of the 61 others is related through a ribosome to an amino-acid in the universal eukariotic code (see

Table 2). Thus the chain of nucleotides in the mRNA – and also in the DNA – can also be viewed as
a sequence of triplets, each corresponding to an amino-acid, except the three above mentioned ones.
These last codons are called non-sense or stop-codons, and their role is to stop the biosynthesis.

One can distinguish 20 diﬀerent amino-acids 1. It follows that diﬀerent codons can be associ-
ated to the same amino-acid, or in other words, that the genetic code is degenerated. Considering

the standard eukariotic code (see Table 2), one remarks that the codons are organized in sextets,
quadruplets, triplets, doublets and even singlets, each multiplet corresponding to a speciﬁc amino-

acid. Such a picture naturally led Hornos and Hornos [2] to look for an underlying symmetry based
on a continuous Lie group. More precisely, the authors tried to answer the following question:
is
it possible to determine a Lie group G carrying a 64-dimensional irreducible representation R and

admitting a subgroup H such that the decomposition of R into irreducible representations under H
gives exactly the diﬀerent just above mentioned multiplets? They proposed as starting symmetry
the symplectic group Sp(6) with successive breakings up to its Cartan part U(1) × U(1) × U(1).

Interpreting the double origin of the nucleotides, each arising either from purine or from pyrim-
idine, as a Z2-grading, a supersymmetric extension of the above model has been proposed [3] with
the superalgebra sl(6|1) as the classiﬁcation (super)algebra before symmetry breaking. A systematic
search for superalgebras the representation theory of which comes close to the multiplet structure of
the genetic code has also been recently carried out in ref. [4].

enveloping algebra in the limit q → 0. Then a triplet of nucleotides will be obtained by constructing
the tensor product of three such four dimensional representations. Actually, this approach mimicks

the group theoretical classiﬁcation of baryons made out from three quarks in elementary particles
physics, the building blocks being here the A, C, G, T (U) nucleotides. The main and essential
diﬀerence stands in the property of a codon to be an ordered set of three nucleotides, which is not
the case for a baryon. Let us be more explicit on an example: there are three diﬀerent codons made
of the A, A, U nucleotides, namely AAU, AUA and UAA, while the proton appears as a weighted
combination of the two u quarks and one d quark, that is |pi ∼ |uudi + |udui + |duui, where the
spin structure is implicit.

Constructing such pure states is made possible in the framework of any algebra Uq→0(G) with G
being any (semi)-simple classical Lie algebra owing to the existence of a special basis, called crystal
basis, in any (ﬁnite dimensional) representation of G. The algebra G = su(2) ⊕su(2) ≃ so(4) appears
the most natural for our purpose. First of all, it is “reasonable” to represent the four nucleotides
in the fundamental representation of G. Moreover, the complementary rule in the DNA–mRNA
transcription may suggest to assign a quantum number with opposite values to the couples (A,T/U)
and (C,G). The distinction between the purine bases (A,G) and the pyrimidine ones (C,T/U) can
2, 1
be algebraically represented in an analogous way. Thus considering the representation ( 1
2) of the
group SU(2) × SU(2) and denoting ± the basis vector corresponding to the eigenvalues ± 1
2 of the J3
generator in any of the two su(2) corresponding algebras, we will assume the following “biological”
spin structure:

Now, let us turn our attention towards the representations of Uq→0(G) and more speciﬁcally to

can be interpreted as the absolute zero temperature in a lattice model. Introducing in Uq→0(G) the
operators ˜ei and ˜fi (i = 1, . . . , rank G) after modiﬁcation of the simple root vectors ei and fi of Uq(G),
a particular kind of basis in a Uq(G)-module can be deﬁned. Such a basis is called a crystal basis
and carries the property to undergo in a specially simple way the action of the ˜ei and ˜fi operators:

2

as an example, for any couple of vectors u, v in the crystal basis B, one gets u = ˜eiv if and only if
v = ˜fiu. One must note that there is no objection to consider the four states C, U, G, A deﬁned in
(2) as constituting a crystal basis for the ( 1
2) module of Uq→0(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)). More interesting for
our purpose is the crystal basis in the tensorial product of two representations. Then the following

2, 1

theorem holds [5]:

Let B1 and B2 be the crystal bases of the M1 and M2 Uq→0(G)-modules respectively. Then for u ∈ B1
and v ∈ B2, we have:

˜fi(u ⊗ v) =

˜ei(u ⊗ v) =

˜fiu ⊗ v ∃ n ≥ 1 such that ˜f n
u ⊗ ˜fiv otherwise
u ⊗ ˜eiv ∃ n ≥ 1 such that ˜en
˜eiu ⊗ v otherwise

(cid:26)

(cid:26)

i u 6= 0 and ˜eiv = 0

i v 6= 0 and ˜fiu = 0

To represent a codon, we will have to perform the tensor product of three ( 1
2) representations of
Uq→0(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)) . However, it is well-known – and easy to check from Tables 1, 2 – that in a
multiplet of codons relative to a speciﬁc amino-acid, the two ﬁrst bases constituent of a codon are
“relatively stable”, the degeneracy being mainly generated by the third nucleotide. For that reason,

2, 1

we will prefer to examine a codon as a 2+1 state instead of a simple triplet. So, let us consider in
detail the ﬁrst tensor product:

From Tables 1 and 2, the dinucleotide states formed by the ﬁrst two nucleotides in a codon can be

put in correspondence with quadruplets, doublets or singlets of codons relative to an amino-acid.
Note that the sextets (resp. triplets) are viewed as the sum of a quadruplet and a doublet (resp.

a doublet and a singlet). The dinucleotide states associated to the quadruplets (as well as those
included in the sextets) of codons satisfy:

As expected from formulae (5) and (6), our model cannot gather codons associated to one par-
ticular amino-acid in the same irreducible multiplet. However, it is possible to construct an operator
R out of the algebra Uq→0(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)), acting on the codons, that will describe the genetic code in
the following way:

Two codons have the same eigenvalue under R if and only if they are associated to the same

amino-acid.

This operator will be called the reading operator. It has the following form:

R = 4

In Eq. (8), the operators JH,3 and JV,3 are the third components of the total spin generators of the
algebra Uq→0(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)), J (3)
V,3 are the third components corresponding to the third nucleotide
of a codon. Of course, these last two operators can be replaced by J (3)
The operator Cα (α = H, V ) is a “Casimir” operator of Uq→0(sl(2)) in the crystal basis.

irreducible representation of highest weight J is J(J + 1), i.e. the same as the undeformed standard

The terms in c1 and c2 are responsible for the structure in quadruplets (given essentially by the
dinucleotide content). The terms in c3 give rise to the splitting of the quadruplets into doublets.
The terms in c4 and c5 lead to the sextets. Finally, the terms in q and q′, that appear only in the
eukariotic code, are responsible for the singlet and triplet structure.

Now, using the values of the quantum numbers JH, JV , JH,3, JV,3, J d

α± (α = H, V ) of the
codons given in Tables 3 and 4, one can compute the action of the reading operator R on each of
the 64 codons.

Although the eukariotic code (EC) seems to be a universal genetic code, it appears in some
way as an advanced form of the vertebral mitochondrial code (VMC). Indeed there is very few

diﬀerence between the two codes. The codons in the VMC are organized into 2 sextets, 6 quadruplets
and 14 doublets. When evolving from the VMC to the EC, one doublet and one quartet merge
together to form a sextet while two other doublets split into four singlets, two of them gluing with

existing doublets to form two triplets. The ﬁnal result for the EC is 3 sextets, 5 quadruplets, 10
doublets, 2 triplets and 2 singlets. Hence, it appears natural to start to calculate R for the vertebral
mitochondrial code.

a) Vertebral Mitochondrial Code:
One ﬁnds the following eigenvalues of the reading operator R in the case of the vertebral mitochon-
drial code, identifying the amino-acids with its corresponding codons (Ser corresponds to the codons
UCX (X=C,U,G,A) while Ser′ corresponds to the codons AGC/AGU; similarly Leu is related to the
quartet CUX and Leu′ to the doublet UUG/UUA; ﬁnally, Arg is given by the quartet CGX and Ter′
to the doublet AGG/AGA):

Pro = −c1 − c2
Ala = −c1 + 3c2
Asp = c1 + 5c2 − 1

Tyr = 5c1 + c2 + 1

Asn = 5c1 + 5c2 − 1

His = c1 + c2 + 1

Arg = −c1 + c2
Cys = 3c1 + c2 + 1
Ser′ = 3c1 + 5c2 − 1
Val = c1 + 3c2
Phe = 5c1 − c2 + 3
Ile = 5c1 + 3c2 + 1

The parameters c3, c4 are ﬁxed by the following requirements. The condition Leu = Leu′ leads to
the expression of the coeﬃcient c3 in function of c1 and c2, and one obtains c3 = −8c1. At this point,
one is led to add a correcting term in R since the symmetry of the genetic code implies Ile = Val
and Cys = Arg as soon as Leu = Leu′ while Ser′ is not equal to Ser. Hence the projector P4 has a
non-vanishing value on the AG, UG and AU dinucleotides. The condition Ser′ = Ser then implies
c4 = 8c1 + 12c2. At this point, Ile and Val on the one hand, and Cys and Arg on the other hand
become diﬀerent as required. Finally, the parameter c5 is ﬁxed for the VMC by requiring that Ter′
= Ter. One ﬁnds c5 = 6c1 + 14c2. The demand to be satisﬁed by R in order to provide diﬀerent
eigenvalues to codons associated to diﬀerent amino-acids implies the non-vanishing of c1 and c2. This
leads, after a rescaling, to express the reading operator for the vertebral mitochondrial code as (where
c ≡ c1/c2):

RV M C(c) = 4

3 CV − 4c P1 JH,3 − 4 P2 JV,3 + (−8c P3 + (8c + 12) P4) JV,3

b) The Eukariotic Code:
In the case of the eukariotic code, most of the eigenvalues of the reading operator are the same. The

diﬀerence between VMC and EC comes i) from the doublets Met and Trp that split into singlets
Met (AUG) + Ile′′ (AUA) and Trp (UGG) + Ter′′ (UGA), and ii) from the doublet Ter′ that merge
with the quartet Arg to form a sextet. The eigenvalues for the new structures are the following:

(14)

(15)

Ter′′ = 3c1 + c2 − 1
Trp = 3c1 + c2 − 1
Ile′′ = 5c1 + 3c2 − 1
Met = 5c1 + 3c2 − 1

2c3 − 1
2c3 − 1
2c3 − 1

2c4 − q′
2c4 + q′
2c4 − q
2c4 + q

The parameters c3, c4 are given as in the VMC. The parameter c5 is now ﬁxed by the condition Ter′
= Arg. One obtains c5 = −4c1 + 14c2. The parameters q and q′ describe the splitting of the doublets
Met and Trp into the singlets: they are determined by requiring Ile′′ = Ile and Ter′′ = Ter. Il follows
that q = −12c2 and q′ = −6c1 − 6c2. Hence the reading operator for the eukariotic code reads as:

REC(c) = 4

3c CH + 4

As in the case (a), we have to rule out the values of the parameter c such that diﬀerent amino-
acids get the same eigenvalue under REC(c). The forbidden values now are the following: −8, −7,

The simple model that we propose needs obviously to be developed. First on the symmetry

point of view, it would be nice to understand or at least to include naturally in our approach the
existence of sextets. Concerning the group structure, we have chosen Uq→0(G) with a minimal group
G = SU(2) × SU(2), keeping in mind a physical interpretation. Of course, a larger symmetry might
be of some help. As a second step, it will be reasonable to consider a more realistic model including
interactions among bases. We wish to be soon able to apply our approach on the one hand for

mutations and on the other hand in the fundamental problem of genome sequence.

Let us end this note by the following general remark. There are intense eﬀorts these days to

develop an interface between physics and biology. Diﬀerent approaches are considered, among them
the study of the DNA as an ideal polymer in the framework of statistical physics. But no direct

connection between biology and elementary particle physics already showed up, in our knowledge.
We hope that our proposal will raise up the interest of elementary particle physics in biology.

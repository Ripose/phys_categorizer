Coherence Resonance and Noise-Induced Synchronization in Globally Coupled
Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons

The coherence resonance (CR) of globally coupled Hodgkin-Huxley neurons is studied. When the
neurons are set in the subthreshold regime near the ﬁring threshold, the additive noise induces limit
cycles. The coherence of the system is optimized by the noise. A bell-shaped curve is found for
the peak height of power spectra of the spike train, being signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from a monotonic
behavior for the single neuron. The coupling of the network can enhance CR in two diﬀerent ways.
In particular, when the coupling is strong enough, the synchronization of the system is induced and
optimized by the noise. This synchronization leads to a high and wide plateau in the local measure
of coherence curve. The local-noise-induced limit cycle can evolve to a reﬁned spatiotemporal order
through the dynamical optimization among the autonomous oscillation of an individual neuron, the
coupling of the network, and the local noise.

The phenomenon of stochastic resonance (SR) has
been intensively studied for the last decade1. The re-
sponse of a noisy nonlinear system to a deterministic sig-
nal can be optimized by noise. Recently, it has been
shown that,
in the absence of a deterministic signal,
the noisy nonlinear system exhibits SR-like behavior2–8.
This phenomenon, which is referred to as coherence res-
onance (CR) or autonomous SR, was ﬁrst discussed in a
simple autonomous system in the vicinity of the saddle-
node bifurcation2,3. The nonuniform noise-induced limit
cycle leads to a peak at a deﬁnite frequency in the power
spectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases ﬁrst
to a maximum and then decreases when the intensity of
noise increases, showing the optimization of the coher-
ent limit cycle to the noise. The frequency was observed
to shift to a higher value by increasing the noise inten-
sity. The CR has also been found in excitable systems, e.
g., the Fitz Hugh-Nagumo model4, the Hodgkin-Huxley
(HH) model5, the Plant model and the Hindermarsh-
Rose model6. Moreover, an experimental evidence of CR
was reported very recently8.

Synchronization in nonlinear stochastic systems has
also attracted growing interests in recent years9–15. SR
and noise-induced global synchronization have been stud-
ied. Regardless of whether the system is locally or glob-
ally coupled, the coupling can enhance the signal trans-
duction and the SNR of the local unit. The coupling
strength can be considered to be another tuning param-
eter of SR. Meanwhile, the noise-induced global synchro-
nization, which coincides with the optimized local per-
formance of the single element in the network, is ob-
served. Moreover, in the study of the coupled stochas-
tic limit cycle, Kurrer and Schulten16 have studied an-
alytically a model of globally coupled stochastic neu-
rons and found noise-enhanced synchronization. On the
other hand, Rappel and Karma17 studied properties of
the power spectra of globally coupled neurons and found

a new eﬀect of noise-induced delta-peak. Recently, the
synchronization and the eﬀect of CR in two coupled ex-
citable oscillators are also investigated numerically and
experimentally18.

In this paper, the CR of the globally coupled HH neu-
rons is studied numerically for the ﬁrst time. We show
that the coupling of the network can enhance CR in
two diﬀerent ways. When the coupling is weak, the CR
phenomenon behaves similar to that of a single neuron,
and no spatiotemporal order can be observed. When
the coupling becomes strong enough, the local measure
of coherence jumps up to a wide plateau ﬁrst and then
jumps down from the plateau as the intensity of noise
increases, due to the spatiotemporal synchronization of
the network. The coupling tends to stabilize the noise-
induced limit cycle and synchronization. The peak fre-
quency of noise-induced limit cycle is selected to be the
spatiotemporal order through the optimization among
the excitability of a single neuron, the coupling of the
network, and the local noise. The phase of synchronized
oscillation is also determined through the dynamical evo-
lution of the system. Because the HH model serves as a
paradigm for spiking neurons, we may relate our results
to the existence of coherent spontaneous oscillations ob-
served in the brain cortex19–21.

Each neuron is described by a set of four time-dependent
variables (Vi, mi, ni, hi) where Vi is the membrane po-
tential, mi and hi the activation and inactivation vari-
ables of sodium current, and ni the activation variable of
potassium current. The meaning and detailed values of
the parameters can be found in Ref.22. The simulation
was done by using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method
with the time step being taken as 0.01msec.

−

Each neuron is subject to an independent noise ηi
with the same intensity, which is determined from an
ηi + √2Dξ,
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process τcdηi/dt =
where ξ is the Gaussian white noise23. D and τc (=
0.1msec.) are the intensity and the correlation time of
the noise, respectively. Ii(t) is the input current, which
will be time-independent and will bias the neuron near
the saddle-node bifurcation. The last term in Eq. (1)
is the coupling of the network. The eﬀect of the ﬁring
activity of jth neuron on the ith neuron is modeled by an
impulse current to the ith neuron, which is proportional
to the eﬃcacy of the synapse Jij and is generated when
the jth neuron is active. Jij = J for all pairs of neurons
with J the coupling strength of the system. The neu-
ron is active whenever its membrane potential exceeds a
threshold V ∗ (= 0mV here). This activity can be de-
noted by Sj = Θ(Vj
0
and Θ(x) = 0 if x < 0. In the present simulation, only
the excitatory coupling is considered (J > 0), that is, the
last term is the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)
received by the single neuron.

The HH neuron is an excitable one. For a dc input
current I0, the ﬁring threshold is Ic = 6.2µA/cm2. The
spike limit cycle occurs at Ic due to the saddle-node bi-
furcation. To observe the CR, we set the input current
I0 = 6.0µA/cm2 for each neuron24, that is, the system
is set in the subthreshold regime near the threshold or
saddle-node bifurcation. For one single HH neuron, the
coherence resonance was discussed in detail in Ref.5. In
the present simulation, we focus on a globally coupled
network, and attempt to extract more signiﬁcant infor-
mation of CR.

The CR exhibits two diﬀerent behaviors when the cou-
pling intensity changes. They can be seen in the power
spectrum of the output spike trains. In the absence of
noise, a single neuron stays at the quiescent state in which
the membrane potential is below V ∗. In this case, there
would be no synaptic transmission between the neurons,
and the whole network would stay at the quiescent state.
If an independent local noise (D
0.3) is applied to each
neuron, the system begins to ﬁre spike trains. When the
coupling is weak (e.g.J = 5.0), the power spectrum den-
sities of the spike trains for diﬀerent intensities of noise

(b) The power spectrum of
the spike train with a strong coupling J = 10.0 forD = 0.5,

When the coupling of the network is strong (e.g., J =
10.0), the power spectrum densities of the spike trains for
diﬀerent intensities of noise are shown in Fig. 1(b). As
the noise is weak, a broad peak is also observed. How-
ever, when the noise intensity increases, the peak be-
comes higher and sharper. This type of power spectrum
is quite diﬀerent from that for usual CR discussed pre-
viously. The sharp peak is induced by the network itself
and locked at the frequency of spontaneous limit cycle.
The detail of this kind of power spectrum has been ad-
dressed in Ref.17. When the noise intensity increases fur-
ther, the sharp peak tends to become broad, keeping the
general trend of CR in the single neuron case.

The diﬀerence of spatiotemporal orders of the network
leads to such two diﬀerent behaviors of CR. In previous

2

studies of the conventional SR , each unit in the network
receives a common external signal with the same fre-
quency and phase. The external signal represents an ex-
ternal ‘clock’ leading to the synchronization of the whole
system. So the tuning of the synchronization to the local
noise, which coincides with the local SNR behavior, can
be observed when the external signal is suﬃcient strong9.
However, in the case of CR, the situation is diﬀerent.
There is no such kind of global tuning in the network.
The local oscillation of each unit is noise-induced limit
cycle. The phase is random in time and is irrelevant to
each other. Besides, a broad peak in Fig.1(a) means that
the frequency has some uncertainty. As a result, the syn-
chronization is not guaranteed in the case of CR.

FIG. 2.

The raster of the network and corresponding
excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) of a neuron with
J=5.0 for diﬀerent intensities of noise: D=1.0 ((a) & (d)),
D=10.0 ((b) & (e)), and D=15.0 ((c) & (f)). The network
size N=1000.

When the coupling is weak, the raster records all the
ﬁring events in the network and the corresponding EPSP
of a single neuron for diﬀerent intensities of noise are
shown in Fig. 2. From Figs. 2(a)-(c), we can see that
there is no synchronization in the system. Especially,
Fig. 2(b) appears to be the most coherent state (D=10.0,

shown in Fig. 4(a) later). To see the inﬂuence of the net-
work on the local unit, the EPSP of an arbitrarily chosen
neuron is shown in Figs. (d)-(f). There is a tendency
that the EPSP increases when the intensity of noise in-
creases. The power spectrum of the EPSP has a broad
peak, which coincides with the CR frequency, similar to
that of the spike train (not shown here).

Figure 3 illustrates how the synchronization can be
observed when the coupling is strong.
It is shown in
the raster (Figs. 3(a)-(c)) that, when the noise is weak
(D=0.5), there is no synchronization. Its corresponding
power spectrum is given in line 1 in Fig. 1(b). When the
noise intensity increases, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the syn-
chronization can be observed. Note that this spatiotem-
poral order is achieved by increasing the intensity of the
independent local noise in the absence of external peri-
odic forcing. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the EPSP received
by a single neuron has an explicit periodicity, that is, the
network produces a kind of periodic oscillation due to the
synchronization, which is quite similar to a deterministic
signal input to each neuron. The corresponding power
spectrum density of the spike train is shown as line 2
in Fig. 1(b). The sharp peak comes from the periodic
EPSP which reﬂects the eﬀect of the synchronization on
the local unit, in agreement with the work on the coupled
integrate and ﬁre neurons17. When the noise intensity
increases further, the synchronization is destroyed; both
the explicit periodicity of the EPSP and the high peak
in the power spectrum of the spike train disappear.

−

Physically, the spatiotemporal order is established
through the dynamical evolution of the system. As shown
in Eq. (1), the EPSP that each neuron receives is the av-
1 neurons. Even
erage of the events of the other N
if there is no synchronization in the system, the power
spectrum of the resulted EPSP should have a dominate
frequency of the limit cycle. This noise-induced EPSP
is aperiodic. Its intensity and quality are dependent on
the intensity of noise and the coupling strength. When
the coupling strength is weak, the EPSP is very small
in comparison with the intensity of the local noise. No
correlation between the output spike train and the input
EPSP can be established. When the coupling strength is
strong enough, the situation will be diﬀerent. Although
the EPSP is still too small for a weak noise, the quality
of EPSP is improved and the intensity is increased as
the noise increases, due to the CR in the single element
level. Since the input current contains a signal with the
same frequency as the output, the output as well as the
EPSP will be reﬁned. This is a process of positive feed-
back. Because the EPSP is the average output of other
neurons, the local neuron tends to keep the pace of such
an averaged signal through the dynamical optimization
process. Finally, a spatiotemporal order can be reached
and the frequency of oscillation, which is just the fre-
quency of CR, is ‘selected’ by the dynamical process. If
the noise intensity increases further, the synchronization
is destroyed. So the EPSP can be viewed as a kind of in-
direct feedback. The EPSP is noise-induced and can be

3

optimized by noise, while such local noise disturbs the
feedback by adding irregularity at each time step. On
the other hand, when the coupling is signiﬁcant, the pos-
itive feedback is established. As a result, the EPSP will
evolve gradually to become an identical periodic forcing
on every single element in the system. The synchroniza-
tion can be observed and optimized by the noise. Due
to the feature of CR in the globally coupled neurons, re-
gardless of whether the system is in the synchronized or
desynchronized state, the frequency locking at the CR
frequency always exists. The synchronization shown in
Fig. 3(b) is a kind of phase locking of all the elements in
the network.

The raster of the network and corresponding

N=1000.

Such noise-induced synchronization possesses two in-
teresting features. First, the synchronization frequency is
dependent on the local noise and the coupling. Secondly,
the phase of spatiotemporal oscillation is determined by
the dynamical evolution of the system itself. Because of
this, the peak frequency of CR is locked at the frequency
of the synchronized oscillation. However, the phase of
the synchronized oscillation is ‘selected’ by the indirect

4

feedback process which is sensitive to the detail process
in the noisy environment. For example, diﬀerent initial
conditions of the simulation lead to the same frequency
but diﬀerent phases of the synchronized oscillation.

We can characterize CR quantitatively via a coherence
factor β2, which is the measure of coherence and deﬁned
as:

β = h(∆ω/ωp)−1,

(6)

where h and ωp are the height and the frequency of the
peak, and ∆ω is the width of the peak at the height
h1 = e− 1

2 h.

The β vs the noise intensity D for diﬀerent couplings
of the network is shown in Fig. 4(a). When D increases,
β increases ﬁrst and then decreases after reaching the
maximum. The coupling may be viewed as a tuning pa-
rameter of CR. For comparison, the CR of a single neuron
case is also displayed in the ﬁgure (J=0). The enhance-
ment of CR is signiﬁcant when the coupling is stronger.
When the coupling is weak, there is no spatiotemporal
order in the system. The value of β is the same order
of the magnitude as that of the single neuron case, and
similar β
D curves are exhibited in the two cases. How-
ever, when the coupling becomes strong enough, the β
increases dramatically with D at ﬁrst, showing the onset
of synchronization, and then a wide plateau is followed,
indicating that the self-evolved spatiotemporal order is
stable against a large range intensity of local noise. The
normalized β vs the noise intensity for diﬀerent coupling
is also shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a) .

−

The diﬀerence of the CR in the single neuron case and
the coupled neurons can be seen in Fig. 4(b), in which
the peak height of the power spectrum densities of the
spike train is plotted against the noise intensity D for dif-
ferent couplings of the network. In the single HH neuron
case (J=0), the height of the peak increase monotonically
as the noise increases (see also Figure 4(b) in Ref.5 ). In
the coupled HH neurons, similar to Fig. 4(a), a bell-
shaped curve is observed. Once the synchronization is
established, the peak height increases dramatically. On
the other hand, even when the coupling is weak and no
synchronization is established, as shown in the inset of
Fig. 4(b), the bell-shape curve can still be observed (J=1,
and J=5 curve in Fig. 4(b)). This means that the height
of CR peak is tuned by the noise in the absence of syn-
chronization. As shown in Fig. 2(d)-(f), the EPSP can
be regarded as a kind of aperiodic signal which has the
same frequency as the output. The tuning to the noise of
such an aperiodic signal is similar to SR, however, unlike
the usual SR, the EPSP here is produced by the network
itself through CR. The intensity and quality of the EPSP
are diﬀerent for diﬀerent strengthens of noise due to the
eﬀect of CR. So, even though the power spectrum density
of the spike train is similar to that of the single neuron
case, the mechism is diﬀerent. The eﬀect of CR can be
enhanced signiﬁcantly by the coupling even when there
is no synchronization.

Figure 5(a) illustrates how the β changes with the size
of the strongly coupled network (J=10.0). Clearly, the
β
D curve changes little whenever the number of the
neurons in the network is larger than 50, with the onset-
point and the end-point of synchronization being almost
unchanged. Although the network is globally coupled,
the degree of synchronization is roughly irrelevant to the
size of the network if it is suﬃciently large.

Figure 5(b) shows the peak frequency of CR as a
function of the intensity of noise for diﬀerent coupling
strengths. We can see that, regardless of the coupling
strength, the frequency will increase when the noise in-
creases, with the same tendency as that for a single neu-
ron case. On the other hand, the frequency increases as
the coupling strength increases, tuning CR in another
way. Moreover, There is no dramatic change of the fre-

5

quency when the spatiotemporal order is established. In
fact, we can not see the diﬀerence of synchronized and
non-synchronized states of the system from this kind of
plot. Both are CR states.

Finally, we address the relevance of the CR of the glob-
ally coupled HH neurons to the activities of realistic neu-
ral systems. In recent years, synchronized spontaneous
oscillations have been observed in the brain cortex and
are proposed to possess a binding function, where the
spatially-distributed neurons resonate to generate large
function states that bring about cognition19–21. From the
simulations, we may elucidate how these synchronized
spontaneous oscillations are established. It would be the
CR state. The frequency of oscillation is determined by
the excitability of a single neuron, the coupling of the
network, and the noise. On the other hand, the synchro-
nization may be noise-induced, giving a possibility that
the noise would play an active role in neural activities.
The synchronized state would be stable in a large range
intensity of the local noise. This feature would enable
the neural system to fulﬁll cognition function in noisy

environment.

In summary, we have studied the CR of globally cou-
pled network of HH neurons. It is found that, when the
coupling is strong, the synchronization is induced and
optimized by the noise. The frequency of CR of the lo-
cal element is locked at the spatiotemporal oscillation
frequency, and the phase of spatiotemporal oscillation is
determined by the dynamical evolution. A wide plateau
in the β
D curve was observed for the strongly coupled
network with large sizes, indicating a stable spatiotem-
poral order in a large range intensity of local noise. The
eﬀect of CR can be enhanced greatly by the coupling re-
gardless of the spatiotemporal order of the system. Our
results may be relevant to the synchronized spontaneous
oscillations observed in some realistic neural systems.

24 It is not necessary to assume the same I0 for every neuron
in the network. The only requirement is to set the neu-
rons near the threshold or saddle-node bifurcation. For a
random distributed I0, we will observe almost the same
phenomenon reported later on.

Abstract

High-density DNA arrays, used to monitor gene expression at a genomic scale, have
produced vast amounts of information which require the development of eﬃcient
computational methods to analyze them. The important ﬁrst step is to extract
the fundamental patterns of gene expression inherent in the data. This paper de-
scribes the application of a novel clustering algorithm, Super-Paramagnetic Cluster-
ing (SPC) to analysis of gene expression proﬁles that were generated recently during
a study of the yeast cell cycle. SPC was used to organize genes into biologically rel-
evant clusters that are suggestive for their co-regulation. Some of the advantages of
SPC are its robustness against noise and initialization, a clear signature of cluster
formation and splitting, and an unsupervised self-organized determination of the
number of clusters at each resolution. Our analysis revealed interesting correlated
behavior of several groups of genes which has not been previously identiﬁed.

1 Introduction

DNA microarray technologies have made it straightforward to monitor simul-
taneously the expression levels of thousands of genes during various cellular
processes [1][2]. The new challenge is to make sense of such massive expression
data [3]. In most such experiments, investigators compare the relative change
of gene expression levels between two samples (one is called the target, such
as a disease sample; the other is called the control, such as a normal sample).
In a typical experiment simultaneous expression levels of thousands of genes
are viewed over a few tens of time-points (or diﬀerent tissues [4]). Hence one
needs to analyse arrays that contain 105 − 106 measurements.

The aims of such analysis are typically to (a) group genes with correlated
expression proﬁles; (b) Focus on those groups which seem to participate in

some biological process; (c) Provide a biological interpretation of the clusters.
Interpretations could be co-regulation of the mean cluster expression with a
known process, a promoter common to most of the genes in the cluster, etc.
(d) In experiments that compare data from diﬀerent tissues (such as tumor
and normal [4]) one also tries to diﬀerentiate them on the basis of their genetic
expression proﬁles.

The sizes of the datasets and their complexity call for multi-variant cluster-
ing techniques which are essential for extracting correlated patterns in the
swarm of data points in multidimensional space (for example, each relative
gene expression proﬁle with k time-points may be regarded as a k-dimensional
vector).

2 SPC

Currently, two clustering appoaches are very popular among biologists. One
is average linkage, a hierarchical clustering method [5], with the Pearson cor-
relation used as a similarity measure [6]. The other is self-organizing maps
(SOMs) [7], whose most popular implementation for array data analysis is
GENECLUSTER [8].

We present here clustering performed by SPC, a hierarchical clustering method
recently introduced by Blatt et al [9]. It is based on an analogy to the physics
of inhomogeneous ferromagnets. Full details of the algorithm [10] and the
underlying philosophy [11] are given elsewhere ; here only a brief description
is provided.

The input required for SPC is a distance matrix between the N data points
that are to be clustered. From such a distance matrix one constructs a graph,
whose vertices are the data points and edges identify neighboring points. Two
points i and j are called neighbors (and connected by an edge) if they satisfy
the K-mutual-neighbor criterion, i.e. iﬀ j is one of the K nearest points to i
and vice versus. With each edge we associate a weight Jij > 0, which decreases
as the distance between points i and j increases.

Assignement of the datapoints to clusters is equivalent to partitioning this
weighted graph. Cluster indices play the role of the states of Potts spins as-
signed to each vertex (i.e. to each original data point). Two neighboring spins
are interacting ferromagnetically with strength Jij. This Potts ferromagnet is
simulated at a sequence of temperatures T . The susceptibility and the correla-
tion function for neighboring pairs of spins are measured. The pair correlation
function serves to identify clusters: high correlation means that the two data
points belong to the same cluster.

2

The temperature T controls the resolution at which clustering is performed;
the algorithm ﬁnds typical clusters at all resolutions. At very low temperatures
all points belong to a single cluster and as T is increased, clusters break
into smaller ones until at high enough temperatures each point forms its own
cluster. The clusters found at all temperatures form a dendrogram. Blatt et
al showed that the SPC algorithm is robust since the clusters are formed due
to collective behavior of the system. The major splits can be easily identiﬁed
by a peak in the susceptibility. For more details see [9–11].

3 Yeast Cell Cycle and Microarray Data

We applied SPC on a recently published data set [14] to determine whether
it could automatically expose known clusters without using prior knowledge.
Eisen et al [6] clustered the genes on the basis of data combined from 7 dif-
ferent experiments. We suspected that mixing the results of diﬀerent experi-
ments may introduce noise into the data associated with a single one. There-
fore we chose to use only a single time course, that of gene expression as
measured in a single process (cell division cycles following alpha-factor block-
and-release [12]). Furthermore, we focused on genes that have characterized
functions (2467 genes) for easier interpretation.

Genetic controls and regulation play a central role in determination of cell
fate during development. They are also important for the timing of cell cycle
events such as DNA replication, mitosis and cytokinesis. Yeast is a single cel-
lular organism, which has become a favorite model in molecular biology due
to the easiness of genetic and biochemical manipulation and the availability of
the complete genome. Like all living cells, the yeast cell cycle consists of four
phases: G1→S→G2→M→G1..., where S is the phase of DNA synthesis (repli-
cating the genome); M stands for mitosis (division into two daughter cells),
and the two gap phases are called G1 (preceding the S phase) and G2 (follow-
ing the S phase). At least four diﬀerent classes of cell cycle regulated genes
exist in yeast [13]: G1 cyclins and DNA synthesis genes are expressed in late
G1; histone genes in S; genes for transcription factors, cell cycle regulators and
replication initiation proteins in G2; and genes needed for cell separation are
expressed as cells enter G1. Early and late G1-speciﬁc transcription is medi-
ated by the Swi5/Ace2 and Swi4/Swi6 classes of factors, respectively. Changes
in the master cyclin/Cdc28 kinases are involved in all classes of regulation.

In the alpha-factor block-release experiments, MATa cells were ﬁrst arrested in
G1 by using alpha pheromone. Then the blocker was removed; from this point
on the cell division cycle starts and the population progresses with signiﬁcant
cell cycle synchrony. RNA was extracted from the synchronized sample, as
well as a control sample (asynchronous cultures of the same cells growning

3

exponentially at the same temperature in the same medium).

Fluorescently labeled cDNA was synthesized using Cy3 (”green”) for the con-
trol and Cy5 (”red”) for the target. Mixtures of equal amounts of the two
samples were taken at every 7min and competitively hybridized to individual
microarrays containing essentially all yeast genes. The ratio of red to green
light intensity (proportional to the RNA concentrations) was measured by
scanning laser microscopy (See [12] for experimental details). The actual data
provided at the Stanford website [14] is the log ratios.

In the their analysis, Spellman et al. were focusing on identiﬁcation of 800 cell
cycle regulated genes (that may have periodic expression proﬁles). In our test
of SPC, in addition to oscillatory genes we were also looking for any groups
of genes with highly correlated expression patterns.

4 SPC Analysis of Yeast Gene Expression Proﬁles

We clustered the expression proﬁles of the 2467 yeast genes of known func-
tion over data taken at 18 time intervals (of 7 min) during two cell division
cycles, synchronised by alpha arrest and release. Denote by Eij the relative
expression of gene i at time interval j. Our data consist of 2467 points in an
18-dimensional space, normalised in the standard way:

Gij = Eij−<Ei>

We looked for clusters of genes with correlated expression proﬁles over the
two division cycles. The SPC algorithm was used with q = 20 component
Potts spins, each interacting with those neighbors that satisfy the K-mutual
neighbor criterion[10] with K = 10. Euclidean distance between the normal-
ized vectors was used as the distance between two genes. This distance is
proportional to the Pearson correlation used by Eisen et. al..

At T = 0 all datapoints form one cluster, which splits as the system is
“heated”. The resulting dendrogram of genes is presented in Fig. 1. Each node
represents a cluster; only clusters of size larger than 6 genes are shown. The
last such clusters of each branch, as well as non-terminal clusters that were
selected for presentation and analysis (in a way described below) are shown
as boxes. The circled boxes represent the clusters that are analysed below.

The position of every node along the horizontal axis is determined for the
corresponding cluster according to a method introduced by Alon et al [4];
proximity of two clusters along this axis indicates that the corresponding tem-
poral expression proﬁles are not very diﬀerent. The vertical axis represents the

4

resolution, controlled by the “temperature” T ≥ 0. The vertical position of a
node or box is determined by the value of T at which it splits. A high verti-
cal position indicates that the cluster is stable, i.e. contains a fair number of
closely-spaced data points (genes with similar expression proﬁles).

In order to identify clusters of genes whose temporal variation is on the scale
of the cell cycle, we calculated for each cluster a cycle score S1, deﬁned as
follows. First, for each cluster C (with NC genes) we calculate the average
normalized expression level at all j = 1, ..., 18 time intervals and the corre-
sponding standard deviations σC(j):

¯GC(j) =

1
NC

Gij

Xi∈C

[σC(j)]2 =

(Gij)2 − [ ¯GC(j)]2

1
NC

Xi∈C

Next, we evaluated the Fourier transform of the mean expression proﬁles ¯GC(j)
for every gene cluster C. To suppress initial transients, the Fourier transform
is performed only over j = 4, ..., 18. Denote the absolute values of the Fourier
coeﬃcients by Ak; the ratio between low-frequency coeﬃcients and the high-
frequency ones was used as a ﬁgure of merit for the time scale of the variation.
We observed that clusters that satisfy the condition

have the desired time dependence, and found 29 clusters (consisting of 167
genes) to have such scores. For many of these clusters, however, the temporal
variation was very weak, i.e. of the same order as the standard deviations
σC(j) of the individual gene expressions of the cluster. We deﬁned another
score, SC

2 , for which we required

¯GC(j)
σC(j) #

(2)

For clusters C that satisfy this condition the “signal” signiﬁcantly exceeds the
noise. We select a cluster if its score exceeds 5.6, while its parent’s score does
not. Only 4 clusters, containing 86 genes, satisfy both conditions (1) and (2);
these are numbered 1 – 4 on Fig. 1. Seven additional relatively stable clusters
which did not satisfy our two criteria, but are of interest, are also selected and
circled on ﬁgure 1.

The corresponding time sequences are shown in Fig 2: ¯GC(j) is plotted for each
cluster versus time j, with the error bars representing the standard deviations
σC(j). Clusters 1,2 and 4 clearly corresponds to the cell cycle.

5 Details and Interpretation of gene clustering.

The full lists of genes that constitute the 11 selected clusters are given in our
website [15]. We present here a short analysis of our clusters. We use standard
notation for bases: R stands for A or G, W for A or T, K for G or T, N for
any base.

Cluster # 1: These are mostly Late G1 phase speciﬁc genes. They con-
tain the major cell cycle regulators: Cln1,2, Clb5,6 and Swi4 as well as DNA
replication and repair genes. One can easily detect MCB (ACGCGT) or SCB
(CRCGAAA) sites in their promoters to which MBF (Swi6p+Mbp1p) and
SBF (Swi6p+Swi4p) bind respectively [13].

Cluster # 4: This cluster contains mostly S phase genes and is dominated by
the histones. Histones are required for wrapping up nascent DNA into nucle-
osomes, their promoters are regulated by CCA (GCGAARYTNGRGAACR),
NEG (CATTGNGCG) as well as SCB (CGCGAAA) [3].

Cluster # 2: These are mostly G2/M phase genes. They contain the ma-
jor cell cycle regulators: Clb1,2 and Swi5/Ace2. It is known that all genes
co-regulated with Clb1,2 are mainly controlled by either Mcm1 at P-box

intervals of 7 minutes. Error bars represent the standard deviations σC(j). Nc is the
number of genes in each cluster. The clusters are numbered as in ﬁgure 1.

(TTWCCYAAWNNGGWAA) or by Mcm1+SFF through the composite site:
(P-box)N2-4RTAAAYAA [12][3].

Clusters # 5, # 6 and # 8: These are mostly ribosomal protein (RP)
genes. The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 137 genes coding for
ribosomal proteins [16]. Since 59 genes are duplicated, the ribosomal gene fam-
ily encodes 78 diﬀerent proteins, 32 of the small and 46 of the large ribosomal
subunit. They are co-regulated because they are sub-components of ribosome
machinery for protein translation. All genes in cluster #6 reside on chromo-
somes 2, 4 and 5, except rpl11b which resides on chromosome 9. All genes
in clusters #5 and #8 (which are very close in the dendrogram of Figure 1)
reside on chromosomes 8-16, except rps17b which resides on chromosome 4.
It is likely that the expression of these ribosomal genes is correlated to their
chromosomal locations. It is interesting that the expression proﬁles appear to

10

10

have pronounced oscillations (throughout in #5, at early times in #6 and late
times in #8). Like most of the RP genes, the ribosomal genes in the 3 clusters
also contain multiple global Regulator Rap1p binding sites in their promoters
within a preferred window of 15-26 bp [17]. The transcription of most RP
genes is activated by two Rap1p binding sites, 250 to 400 bp upstream from
the initiation of transcription. Since Rap1p can be both an activator and a
silencer, it is not known whether Rap1p is responsible for the oscillation. This
oscillation could be a result of interplay between cell cycle and Rap1p activity
which determines the mean half life of the RP mRNAs (5-7min, [18]). As fresh
medium was added at 91min during the alpha-factor experiments, the genes
in #6 and in #8 may have diﬀerent responses to the nutrient change.

Cluster #7: This cluster has 42 genes that are largely not cell cycle regu-
lated. These genes have diverse functions in general metabolism. When search-
ing promoter regions for regulatory elements using gibbsDNA [20], a highly
conserved motif GCGATGAGNT is shared by 90 % of genes. This element
seems to be novel, it has some similarity to Gcn4p site TGACTC and Yap1p
site GCTGACTAATT [19]. When searching the yeast promoter database -
SCPD [21], we found that the BUF site in the HO gene promoter and the
UASPHR site in the Rad50 promoter appear to contain the core motif GAT-
GAG. Although we do not know if this element is functional or what might be
the trans-factor, it is still very likely that it may contribute the co-regulation
of this cluster of genes.

Cluster #10: This cluster is characterized by a pronounced dip towards the
end of the proﬁle. They are not cell cycle regulated by and large, except Clb4
(a S/G2 cyclin ) and Rad54 (a G1 DNA repair gene). By searching promoter
elements, we found a conserved motif RNNGCWGCNNC that is shared by a
subset of the genes (Clb4, YNL252C, Rad54, Rpb10, Atp11 and Pex13). It
partially matches a PHO4 binding motif (TCGGGCCACGTGCAGCGAT) in
the promoter of Pho8. However, the PHO4 consensus, CACGTK, does not
appear in the conserved motif of our cluster. Therefore we suspect that it is a
novel motif which should be tested by experiments.

6 Summary

We used the SPC algorithm to cluster gene expression data for the yeast
genome. We were able to identify groups of genes with highly correlated tem-
poral variation. Three of the groups found clearly correspond to well known
phases of the cell cycle; some of our observations of other clusters reveal fea-
tures that have not been identiﬁed previously and may serve as the basis of
future experimental investigations.

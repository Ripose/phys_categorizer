The potential energy surface of the H13 proton in base cytosine of the DNA molecules is calculated
ab initio at the Gaussian98 MP2/6-311G(d,p) level. Two potential wells are found. One corresponds
to the normal cytosine, while the other corresponds to its imino tautomer. The bindings of the proton
in these wells are stable enough against the thermo-disturbance. The motions of the proton in these
wells are oscillations around the nearest nitrogen atom like the pendula, and may move far away from
the nitrogen atom to form the hydrogen bond with other bases. The estimated tunneling probability
of the H13 proton from one well to another well shows that the life time of the proton staying in one
2
of these wells is about 6×10
yr. It is too long to let tautomers of cytosine be in thermodynamical
equilibrium in a room temperature gas phase experiment. The biological signiﬁcance of these result
is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

More than 40 years ago, Per-Olov Lowdin [1] proposed
a program for the research of mutation, aging, and can-
cer formation on the basis of DNA changes due to the
tunneling of the hydrogen bond proton through the bar-
rier separating its normal and ill conﬁgurations. It was
unable to realize this attractive program at that time,
since both the theoretical chemical method and the com-
putational ability were not enough developed. Having
ab intio method with its fairly developed software pack-
age and high performance computers in hand, one is able
to try it now. Many works have been done along this
direction. References [2]-[15] are some earlier examples.
However, we do not yet see the previous report on the
ab initio calculation about the potential surface and the
corresponding motion of the hydrogen bond proton.

The four bases (A, T, C, G) in a DNA molecule
usually stay in their normal conﬁgurations, but occa-
imino/enol conﬁgu-
sionally transfer to their unusual
rations with small probabilities.
It is the transitions
A↔ Aimino, T↔ Tenol, G↔ Genol, and C↔ Cimino.
The imino/enol tautomers will be paired in the way
· · ·T, and G· · · Tenol.
Aimino
It makes the possible changes

· · ·C, A· · · Cimino, Genol

C · · · G ↔ T · · · A

(1)

of the base pairs in DNA during its double replications.
For an example, the transition C→ Cimino changes the
pair C· · ·G to Cimino G , and the pairing A· · · Cimino
produces pairs A· · · Cimino and G· · ·C in a ﬁrst repli-
cation. A further replication produces pairs T· · ·A,
· · ·A ,C· · ·G , and C· · ·G. In the ﬁrst case, a pair
Cimino
T· · ·A appears at the position originally occupied by the
pair C· · ·G . This is a change of heredity code, therefore is

serious. It may inﬂuence the development and reproduc-
tion of a living system, cause aging, cancer, and mutation
for examples. To understand and research these kinds of
processes at the level of quantitative theoretical physics
would be highly desirable.

hydrogen bonds (dashed lines) The attached number is for

Figure 1 and 2 show the structure formulae of base cy-
tosine and its imino tautomer, as well as their diﬀerent
pairings. The diﬀerence between these two tautomers
of cytosine lies mainly in the diﬀerent positions of the
proton H13. This diﬀerence in turn causes the diﬀerent
distribution of hydrogen bonds, and ﬁnally causes the
diﬀerent pairings. Therefore, to clarify the potential sur-
face of proton H13 and its motion under the inﬂuence of
this potential is the key for understanding the transition
C→ Cimino between cytosine tautomers and the change
C· · · G → T · · ·A of the base pair in DNA.

Section 2 is devoted to ﬁnding the potential surface
of the proton H13 (the hydrogen bond proton) for base
cytosine by ab initio calculation. In section 3, we prove

that the proton H13 is bound in both, normal and imino,
conﬁgurations, and it is ready for forming the right hy-
drogen bond of pairing.
In section 4 we calculate the
tunneling probability of the proton H13 between these
two conﬁgurations and discuss its biological signiﬁcance.
Section 5 contains the conclusion and a discussion of the
reliability of the results.

II. POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACE OF THE
PROTON H13 FOR CYTOSINE

We have calculated the single point energy (SPE) of
the proton H13 ab initio by MP2 method in Gaussian98
package with the 6-311G(d,p) base set. For every given
position of this proton, positions of other atoms in cy-
tosine are optimized by the minimization of the energy
of the electron system. It causes a small change of these
positions in cytosine. Using a coordinate system ﬁxed
on the known structure formula of cytosine, the obtained
map of the potential energy surface of the proton H13 is
shown in ﬁgure 3. In this ﬁgure, the origin of the coor-
dinate system is at the position of N11 in ﬁgure 1, the x
axis is along its direction N11-C1, and the y axis is per-
pendicular to x axis and points to the right. The bluer
is the point in ﬁgure 3 the lower is the potential at that
position. The number attached on the line shows the sin-
gle point energy along the contour. We see clearly two
potential wells. The left one corresponds to the cytosine,
and the right one corresponds to its imino tautomer. It
explains the structure of these two cytosine tautomers
shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2.

III. BINDING OF PROTON H13 IN THE BASE
CYTOSINE AND ITS IMINO TAUTOMER

Around the bottom of a well, we ﬁt the calculated sin-
gle point energies by a quadratic form of coordinates and
ﬁnd the minimum of SPE by diﬀerentiation. The mini-
mum SPE of the left well is −393.9535268 a.u and that
of the right well is −393.952654 a.u. Moving the origin of
the coordinate system to the position of minimum SPE,

ton H(13) in cytosine. The energy is in atom unit (a.u.), and
the length is in the unit of pico-meter (pm).

the terms containing ﬁrst degree of coordinate disappear.
Finding the principal axes of the coordinate system by
the standard method, we may transform the quadratic
form into a sum of squares of normal coordinate. For the
left well, we take a coordinate system (ξ, η) with the ξ
axis along the direction N11-H13 in cytosine of ﬁgure 1,
and η axis perpendicular to it. The normal coordinates
(X, Y ) is related to (ξ, η) by a rotation.

The SPE as a function of normal coordinates (X, Y ) is

(3)

in which the single point energy E is in unit of a.u., and
the unit of the length is angstrom. We see that E is inde-
pendent of the coordinate X at the bottom of this well.
The potential surface here looks like a valley along X
direction. The transformation (2) shows it is a direction
near the line N11-H13. Along this direction, the proton
is easier to go far away from the atom N11 to form a hy-
drogen bond with O15 in guanine. It explains the pairing
shown in ﬁgure 1. The oscillation is along the Y direc-
tion perpendicular to this direction. It is an oscillation
around the atom N11 in cytosine, like a pendulum ‘hang’
at N11. The frequency is

and the zero point energy (ZPE) is

hν = 0.0026a.u .

(5)

Adding this ZPE with the SPE at the bottom of the
well, we ﬁnd that the energy of the proton H13 is
−393.9509 a.u..
It is lower than the lowest maximum
SPE −393.8895 a.u. around the well. The proton H13 is
therefore bound in the normal cytosine, with a binding
energy b=0.0614a.u..

For the right well in ﬁgure 3, we take the coordinate
system (x′, y′), with the x′ axis parallel the x axis in
ﬁgure 3, while its origin is moved to the bottom of the
well. The normal coordinates (X, Y ) is related to (x′,
y′) by a rotation

E is independent of the coordinate X again at the bottom
of the well, and the potential surface looks like a valley
along the X direction once more. The transformation (6)
shows it is a direction almost perpendicular to the line
N11-C1. Along this direction, the proton is easier to go
far away from the atom N2 of cytosine-imino in ﬁgure 2
to form a hydrogen bond with atom N2 in adenine. It
explains the pairing shown in ﬁgure 2. The oscillation
is almost along this line. It is an oscillation around the
atom N2 in cytosine-imino, like a pendulum ‘hang’ at
this atom N2. The frequency is

2 × 0.12878 × 27.21 × 1.60217733 × 10−19

and the ZPE is

(9)

The lowest maximum SPE around two wells are at the
same point, it is a point between these two wells. The
SPE −393.8895 a.u. at this point is called the energy of
the transitional state. The sum of the ZPE and the bot-
tom SPE is the energy −393.9496 a.u. of the proton H13
in this well. It is also lower than the transitional state en-
ergy. The proton H13 is bound too in the cytosine-imino.
The binding energy here is b′=0.0601 a.u.

The thermo-energy in a living system may be esti-
mated to be kBT =0.001a.u. at the room temperature
T ≃ 300K. We see that b and b′ are much larger than
the thermal energy.
It implies that both cytosine and
its imino tautomer are stable against the thermal distur-
bance.

IV. TUNNELING BETWEEN TWO
TAUTOMERS AND ITS BIOLOGICAL
SIGNIFICANCE

According to quantum mechanics, there is still a pos-
sibility of the proton tunneling from one well to another
well. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the path of lowest potential connect-
ing the centers of these two wells. It is described by the
equation

y(x) = 1.1417352 + 0.71244583x + 0.3508047x2

+ 0.06419875x4 − 0.56534255x5

+ 0.04422011x3
+ 0.25248558x6

(10)

in the coordinate system used in ﬁgure 3, with the length
unit being changed to angstrom. The potential energy in
atom unit along the path is ﬁtted by the formula

V (x) = −393.908877 + 0.103691x − 0.102525x2
− 0.3063312x3 + 0.102250x4 + 0.355250x5
− 0.195806x6 .

(11)

The potential barrier between two wells of the proton H13
is shown in Figure 4. According to the WKB formula,
the penetration probability of the proton through this
barrier is

Therefore, the mean life time for a proton staying in one
of these wells is 6×102 years. It means the time needed
for reaching the thermo-equilibrium is more than six hun-
dred years. One could not see this equilibrium of gas type
cytosine and its imino tautomer in his one hundred year
life. We had better to assume that the large ratio between
populations of cytosine and its imino tautomer in nature
is not a result of thermo-equilibrium, but rather the natu-
ral selection resulting in biological evolution. From (13)
we also see, in one’s one hundred year life time, about
sixteen percent of his cytosine bases may have sponta-
neously transferred into some imino form. Some of them
may transfer back into normal form of cytosine, while

some others, according to Lowdin’s conjecture, may in-
duce aging, mutation or cancer in further replications of
DNA. Of course, cytosine as well as other bases of DNA
molecules are not isolated in living systems. Their tran-
sitions to ‘ill’ tautomers must be inﬂuenced by their en-
vironment. To clarify this inﬂuence, one has to do more
complicated calculations for a base-environment system.
A deeper research along this direction would be interest-
ing.

including the possible positions and directions of their
hydrogen bond formation. It makes us be conﬁdent that
this method is applicable and eﬀective in the bio-physics
research, and predict the transition probability between
normal and imino states of cytosine. The result is rea-
sonable. Its biological signiﬁcance is discussed above and
worthy to explore further.

There are a large number of atoms in a bio-molecule.
The energy of the molecule is contributed by atoms in
it and by their interactions. The energy change of the
molecule in the physical, chemical or biological reactions
is usually a tiny part of the total energy of the molecule.
To study the behavior and the energy change of the bio-
molecule in these reactions, we need very precise calcu-
lations to keep many digits of the value be correct. For
an example, as we have seen at the beginning of section
3, to compare the single point energy of the proton at
the centers of two wells, we need at least ﬁrst 6 digits
of the calculated values be precise. This is not easy in
such a huge amount of numerical calculations. For the
results reported here, the general tendency of the poten-
tial surface may be reliable, but the diﬀerence of SPE for
specially chosen pair of points may not be so, since the
ﬁrst 5 most reliable digits are subtracted. On the other
hand, the tunneling probability may be reliable, since a
part of statistical errors may be canceled by each other
in an integration. Anyway, to develop the more precise
programs with speciﬁed upper bound of possible errors
would be very desirable in further researches along this
direction.

duces the structures of cytosine and its imino tautomer,

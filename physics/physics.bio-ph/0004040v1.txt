The macroscopic curvature induced in the double helical
B-DNA by regularly repeated adenine tracts (A-tracts) is a
long known, but still unexplained phenomenon. This eﬀect
plays a key role in DNA studies because it is unique in the
amount and the variety of the available experimental infor-
mation and, therefore, is likely to serve as a gate to the un-
known general mechanisms of recognition and regulation of
genome sequences. We report the results of molecular dy-
namics simulations of a 25-mer B-DNA fragment with a se-
quence including three A-tract phased with the helical screw.
It represents the ﬁrst model system where properly directed
static curvature emerges spontaneously in conditions exclud-
ing any initial bias except the base pair sequence. The eﬀect
has been reproduced in three independent MD trajectories of
10-20 ns with important qualitative details suggesting that
the ﬁnal bent state is a strong attractor of trajectories form
a broad domain of the conformational space. The ensemble
of curved conformations, however, reveals signiﬁcant micro-
scopic heterogeneity in contradiction to all existing theoretical
models of bending. Analysis of these unexpected observations
leads to a new, signiﬁcantly diﬀerent hypothesis of the possi-
ble mechanism of intrinsic bends in the double helical DNA.

INTRODUCTION

The intrinsic sequence dependent curvature of the
DNA molecule is likely to be involved in fundamen-
tal mechanisms of genome regulation. The possibility
of strong static bends in the B-DNA double helix has
been proven for sequences containing regular repeats of
AnTm, with n+m > 3, called A-tracts1. This eﬀect plays
an important role in DNA studies because it is unique in
the amount and the variety of the available experimental
information and, possibly, it can serve as a gate to the un-
known general mechanisms of recognition and regulation
of genome sequences. Every A-tract deviates the helical
axis in a locally ﬁxed direction by approximately 18◦,
and, if the A-tracts are repeated in phase with the heli-
cal screw, a macroscopic curvature emerges. The eﬀect
was ﬁrst noticed and identiﬁed in restriction fragments
from the kinetoplast body of Leishmania tarentolae2,3,
and conﬁrmed by electric birefringence decay4 and elec-
tron microscopy5. A large variety of interesting infor-
mation has been obtained by biochemical methods.
It
appeared that the double helix bends towards the minor
grooves of A-tracts6,7. The curvature is reduced with the

1

temperature above 40◦ and in high salt, but for some se-
quences it is increased in presence of divalent metal ions8.
It depends upon the length and composition of A-tracts
as well as on sequences between them6. Detailed analy-
sis of these results can be found in comprehensive reviews
published in diﬀerent years1,9,10,11,12,13.

According to many independent experimental obser-
vations, the structure of A-tract sequences should diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from the “random” B-DNA. It is well es-
tablished that, in solution, the poly-dA double helix is
overwound to a twist of around 36◦ from around 34◦
of a random sequence14,15,16. The models constructed
from ﬁber diﬀraction data suggest consistently that the
poly-dA double helix is characterized by a very narrow
minor groove and a high propeller twist17,18,19. Yet an-
other distinction is an apparently large negative inclina-
tion of base pairs18. Several A-tracts avaliable in sin-
gle crystal structures of B-DNA oligomers have irreg-
ular conformations, but exhibit similar trends toward
their centers20,21,22,23,24. Even though the curvature is
apparently caused by A-tracts, in Xray structures, A-
tracts look generally less prone to bending than other
sequences. Some indirect observations also support this
view, notably, poly-dA fragments move faster than ran-
dom DNA in gel migration assays6 and avoid wrapping
around nucleosome particles25,26.

In spite of a large body of the experimental infor-
mation accumulated during the last twenty years, the
possible physical mechanism of this eﬀect remains un-
clear. Since every base pair in a stack interacts only
with the two neighbors, any sequence speciﬁcity in the
DNA structure should mainly depend upon the stacking
interactions in one base pair step. Non-local eﬀects are
also possible, however, due to base-backbone interactions
and propagation of correlations along the backbone. The
initial experimental data on A-tract bending were inter-
preted in terms of two alternative mechanisms, namely,
the wedge model27 and the junction model28. Both had
to be modiﬁed signiﬁcantly as and when new experimen-
tal data appeared and some other theories were discussed
as well. The possible mechanisms of bending considered
in the literature will be discussed below. Here we note
only that none of them explains all experimental data
and can be deﬁnitely preferred1. The overall pattern has
been additionally complicated when it was found that
certain non A-tract sequences also exhibit distinguish-
able curvature29.

Here we report new results obtained in free unbiased
molecular dynamics simulations of a DNA oligomer with
phased A-tracts. We managed to ﬁnd computational con-
ditions in which stable sequence dependent static cur-
vature emerges spontaneously in good agreement with
experimental observations in terms of both the bending
direction and magnitude.
It is found that three inde-
pendent long time trajectories converge to conformations
with similar bends, but rather diﬀerent local structural
parameters, in evident contradiction with the common
views of the origin of curvature. Analysis of these dis-
crepancies leads to a new, signiﬁcantly diﬀerent hypoth-
esis of the possible mechanism of intrinsic bends in the
double helical DNA.

Theoretical Background

As a theoretical problem, the phenomenon of the se-
quence dependent DNA bending presents a challenge in
many aspects similar to the protein folding problem. In
order to understand the underlying physical mechanism,
one has to analyze terribly noisy experimental data, with
the noise being due to the biological diversity and, there-
fore, unremovable. If and when the physical mechanism
is understood one will have to tackle this diversity again,
because it will be necessary to analyze speciﬁc DNA se-
quences. The atom level molecular modeling is virtually
the only theoretical approach that is potentially able to
treat these diﬃculties. Ideally, we would like to have a
model where the base pair sequence represents the only
initial bias towards a speciﬁc conformation. If it could
reproducibly yield curved DNA conformations in agree-
ment with experimental data we should be able disclose
the mechanism of bending in the model, and hope that
a similar mechanism takes place in the nature.

The foregoing scheme, however, is too diﬃcult and, un-
til now, most of the modeling studies used other strate-
gies. Much has been learned about the DNA bending
mechanics by using energy minimization30,31,32,33 and
Monte Carlo34. Unfortunately, the possibilities of such
studies are limited by the multiple minima problem es-
pecially when it is necessary to take into consideration
speciﬁc interaction with solvent molecules. The proposed
alternative strategies commonly involved some bias to-
wards speciﬁcally bent conformations introduced either
explicitly, by imposing restraints, or implicitly, by choos-
ing particular initial conditions, which made impossible
unequivocal conclusions concerning the possible mech-
anism of bending.
In the recent years, owing to the
progress achieved in improving the full atom force ﬁelds,
multi-nanosecond free MD simulations of DNA became
feasible35,36. A few such studies of phased A-tract se-
quences have been already reported37,38.
It has been
demonstrated that, without any a priori bias, the DNA
double helix bends anisotropically, and certain sequence
speciﬁc features of A-tracts were at least qualitatively re-

produced. At present, the free MD simulations represent
the most promising line of research in this ﬁeld, and we
continue it here by using the recently proposed minimal
model of B-DNA39,40.

The minimal B-DNA consists of a double helix with
the minor groove ﬁlled with explicit water. Unlike the
more widely used models, it does not involve explicit
counterions and damps long range electrostatic interac-
tions in a semi-empirical way by using distance scaling
of the electrostatic constant and reduction of phosphate
charges. We have earlier found that the minimal model
gives B-DNA conformations which better compare with
experimental structures than DNA structures obtained
with other computational methods. Notably, it is free
from a systematic negative bias of the average twist ob-
served in simulations with full hydration and explicit
counterions39. This factor is likely to be involved in
DNA bending because, as noted above, A-tracts are over-
wound with respect to the average B-DNA. For the stan-
dard test case of the EcoRI dodecamer structure, the dy-
namics of the minimal model reproducibly converged to
structures slightly bent towards the minor groove which
was narrowed in excellent agreement with the single crys-
tal conformation39,40. All these preliminary observations
suggested that the minimal model was a good choice for
studying the DNA bending induced by A-tracts.

We report here simulations of the bending dynam-
ics of a 25-mer B-DNA fragment.
Its sequence,
AAAATAGGCTATTTTAGGCTATTTT, has been con-
structed after many preliminary tests with shorter se-
quence motives, and it includes three A-tracts separated
by one helical turn. Our general strategy came out
from the following considerations. Although the A-tract
sequences that induce the strongest bends are known
from experiments, probably not all of them would work
in simulations. There are natural limitations, such as
the precision of the model, and, in addition, the lim-
ited duration of trajectories may be insuﬃcient for some
A-tracts to adopt their speciﬁc conformation. Also,
there is little experimental evidence of static curvature
in short DNA fragments, notably, one may well expect
the speciﬁc A-tract structure to be unstable near the
ends. That is why we did not simply take the strongest
experimental “benders”, but looked for sequence mo-
tives that in calculations readily adopt the character-
istic local structure, with a narrow minor groove pro-
ﬁle and high propeller twist, both in the middle and
near the ends of the duplex. The complementary du-
plex AAAATAGGCTATTTTAGGCTATTTT has been
constructed by repeating and inverting one such motive.
Our goal was to ﬁnd sequences that would appear stat-
ically bent in these conditions.
It means that, in dy-
namics, the structure should ﬂuctuate around a state
with a distinguishable bend and a deﬁnite bending direc-
tion. Since any MD simulation is limited in time, there
is no way to prove rigorously that some speciﬁc confor-
mation is representative. Some degree of conﬁdence can
be achieved, however, if independent trajectories are able

2

converge to the same state, and this is exactly what we
tried to obtain. We found important to place A-tracts
at both ends because of the two reasons. First, we could
study only short DNA fragments, therefore, it was prefer-
able to place A-tracts at both ends in order to maximize
the possible bend. Second, in calculations with short se-
quences, it is important to be sure that the boundary
conditions are correct. Since the A-tracts have a char-
acteristic local structure, the boundary conditions could
be at least qualitatively veriﬁed, which would not be the
case for GC-rich sequences.

RESULTS

Three long MD trajectories were computed for
a complementary DNA duplex with the sequence
AAAATAGGCTATTTTAGGCTATTTT.
The model
system employed was same in all three simulations, with
only the starting states varied. The ﬁrst trajectory re-
ferred to below as TJBa started from the ﬁber canoni-
cal B-DNA structure41 and continued to 10 ns. When
it was found that TJBa converged to a statically bent
conformation, in good qualitative agreement with expec-
tations based upon experimental data, another trajec-
tory (TJBb) was computed in order to verify the repro-
ducibility of the results. It started with random velocities
from a re-minimized straight conformation taken from
the initial phase of TJBa and was also continued to 10
ns. Simultaneously, in order to remove any initial bias
implicitly involved in the choice of the starting state, the
third trajectory (TJA) was obtained which started form
the ﬁber canonical A-DNA conformation41. Initially, we
computed 10 ns of TJA and found that it sampled con-
formations rather dissimilar from those observed in TJBa
and TJBb. A careful analysis revealed, however, certain
slow structural trends and prompted us to continue TJA
to 20 ns. The ﬁrst two trajectories (TJBa and TJBb)
have been the subject of our initial report42. Therefore,
below we describe in detail only TJA and use the cor-
responding data from TJBa and TJBb in comparisons.
The structures referred to as the ﬁnal MD states are the
conformations averaged over the last nanosecond of the
corresponding trajectory. The detailed computational
protocols are described in Methods.

All Three Trajectories Converge to Similar

Structures within B-DNA Family

Table I presents atom rmsd comparison between the
ﬁnal MD states of the tree trajectories and canonical A
and B-forms of this 25-mer duplex. All computed struc-
tures are clearly diﬀerent from the standard A-DNA, even
though for TJA it was the starting point. Moreover, the
TJA ﬁnal state appears to be the less similar of the three,

FIG. 1. Kinetics of the structural convergence for TJA.
The time dependence of the nonhydrogen atom rmsd from
the canonical B-DNA conformation (blue) and the ﬁnal TJBa
state (red) are shown. Both traces were smoothed by averag-
ing with a window of 75 ps.

demonstrating that the trajectories were not trapped ki-
netically in the vicinities of their starting points. At the
same time, the ﬁnal MD states are evidently close to
the canonical B-DNA. When only the central undecamer
is considered, the rmsd values are in the same range as
those observed in our earlier MD simulations of dode-
camer duplexes39,40. They are low, and the three com-
puted conformations seem to form a single cluster around
the canonical B-DNA. The rmsd naturally increases with
the helix length, but it should be noted that the some-
what larger values obtained for the whole structures are
much lower than ever observed in free MD simulations of
long DNA helices37. It appears, however, that, if taken
as a whole, the TJA state is as close to the canonical B-
DNA as to the TJBa and TJBb states, while the latter
two are yet closer to each other.

The kinetics of the structural convergence in terms of
atom rmsd is illustrated in Fig. 1 for TJA. It is seen that
the trajectory rapidly went from the initial A-DNA con-
formation towards the B-DNA form and, after the equi-
libration, the rmsd from B-DNA have already lost a half
of the initial 8.6 ˚A. Starting from the second nanosecond
it ﬂuctuated between 2 and 4 ˚A. The corresponding ki-
netics for TJBa and TJBb were very similar except for
the initial fall of the rmsd value42. The rmsd from the
TJBa state also shown in Fig. 1 falls down to similar
ﬁnal values, but exhibits a somewhat diﬀerent kinetics.
Namely, an overall negative drift occurred during the ﬁrst

helicoidal axis. Thus, a zero angle between the two planes corresponds to the overall bend to the minor groove exactly at the

ten nanoseconds followed by random ﬂuctuations during
the second half of the trajectory. One may say, therefore,
that TJA ﬁrst quickly traveled from A-DNA towards the
B-DNA family and next slowly reﬁned its position within
this family coming closer to other computed structures.
This reﬁnement was not complete, however, since, ac-
cording to Table I, the ﬁnal TJA-TJB diﬀerence is still
larger than that between TJBa and TJBb. Figure 1 sug-
gests that a more accurate convergence, if possible, would
require much longer time.

Table II compares a few representative structural pa-
rameters of MD conformations with the corresponding
standards. Already after the ﬁrst nanosecond even TJA
gave the helicoidals corresponding to the B-DNA fam-
ily, and they exhibited no systematic change afterwards.
All three ﬁnal MD states have an overall bend of around
30◦. The bending direction is somewhat diﬀerent be-
tween TJA and TJB, which is the main cause of the
corresponding residual diﬀerence in terms of atom rmsd.
Table II indicates that in all three trajectories both the
magnitude and the direction of the bends changed sig-
niﬁcantly, and that very large variations in the bending
direction apparently occurred in TJA. Thus, the slow
rmsd kinetics considered above appear to be largely due
to the bending of the double helices whereas the contri-
bution from the variations of the helical parameters looks
minor.

Figure 2 shows the three last nanosecond average struc-
tures superimposed. They all are evidently curved, with
the bends being nearly planar in each structure. In agree-
ment with Table II, the TJA bending plane slightly de-
viates from the other two. The bending planes intersect
the minor groove in ﬁve points which alternate between
the inside and the outside edges of the bend, and in each
case the the three A-tracts appear at the inside edge. The
tracts are approximately phased with the helical turn,
but, since the lower one is inverted with respect to the

other. The three inside intersection points are shifted
within the A-tracts from their middle towards the 3’ end
of the upper two and the 5’ end of the lower one. On
the other hand, the minor grooves of the two AGGC
tetraplets appear at the outside edge of the curved axis,
and it is readily seen that the minor groove is widened
here, especially at the upper tetraplet.

Quasi-Regular Rotation of The Bending Plane in

X

TJA

The two surface plots in Fig. 3 exhibit the time evo-
lution of the shape of the helical axis for TJA. It is seen
that the molecule was strongly bent after the initial equi-
libration, which was not observed in case of TJBa and
TJBb42. One should note that considerable initial de-
formation of the double helix is common for trajectories
starting from the A-DNA conformation. Apparently, the
molecule is stressed because the transition to the B-form
occurs in these conditions during unphysically short time
with much energy released. During the next few nanosec-
onds the bend reduced and the axis acquired a more com-
plex shape with wound proﬁles in both projections. After
the ﬁfth nanosecond the bending became more planar,
with much smaller curvature in Y projection. A pla-
nar bent may just mean that the helical axis is kinked
in a single point or, alternatively, a lager number of lo-
cal bends are properly directed. Figure 3 indicates that
there is probably a mixture of these two eﬀects. During
the last few nanoseconds the axis had one stable bend-
ing point shifted upwards from the middle while another
bend in the lower half emerged from time to time. The
two bends were slightly misaligned, therefore, the over-
all bending plane rotated a little when the second bend
emerged, and, in the Y projection, one sees alternation
of straight and S-shaped proﬁles.

Figure 4 displays kinetics of several quantitative mea-
sures of the magnitude of bending. The three parame-
ters used, namely, the total angle, the shortening, and
the average shift of the curved axis, all exhibit a coher-
ent pattern of ﬂuctuations, which locally correlates also
with the rmsd from the canonical B-DNA (see Fig. 1).
This indicates that they all are produced by the same
motion, namely, the axis bending. Comparison of the
data in Figs. 3 and 4 with similar plots earlier reported
for TJBa and TJBb42 reveals little diﬀerence except the
already mentioned initial deformation and the absence
of a stable bend between the two lower A-tracts. Ac-
cordingly, TJBa and TJBb showed a somewhat stronger
bending, with one-nanosecond average values usually be-
yond 35◦.
In TJA, after the initial strong temporary
bending, a comparable magnitude has been reached only
during the last four nanoseconds.

There is, however, a striking diﬀerence between TJA
and the other two trajectories in the dynamics of the

FIG. 3. The time evolution of the overall shape of the op-
timal helical axis in TJA. A best ﬁt axis of coaxial cylindri-
cal surfaces passing through sugar atoms was computed for
conformations stored with a 2.5 ps interval. In all cases pre-
sented here this axis was close to that produced by the Curves
algorithm43. The curved DNA axis is rotated with the two
ends ﬁxed at the OZ axis to put the middle point at the OX
axis. Note that this procedure does not keep the structures
superimposed, that is the same curved axis can correspond
to diﬀerent bending directions. The axis is next character-
ized by two perpendicular projections labeled X and Y. Any
time section of the surfaces shown in the ﬁgure gives the axis
projection averaged over a time window of 150 ps. The hor-
izontal deviation is given in angstr¨oms and, for clarity, its
relative scale is two times increased with respect to the true
DNA length. Shown on the right are the two perpendicular
views of the last one-nanosecond-average conformation in the
orientation corresponding to that in the surface plots at the
end of the trajectory.

FIG. 4. The time evolution of the magnitude of bending in
TJA. The bending angle is measured between the two ends of
the helical axis. The shift parameter is the average deviation
of the helical axis from the straight line between its ends.
The shortening is measured as the ratio of the lengths of the
curved axis to its end-to-end distance minus one.

bend direction which is exhibited in Fig. 5. Both in TJBa
and TJBb the ﬁnal bending direction occurred early in
the trajectories and remained quite stable although the
molecule sometimes straightened producing broad scat-
tering of points in Fig. 5. In contrast, during the ﬁrst
ten nanoseconds of TJA, the bending plane made almost
a half turn with respect to the coordinate system bound
to the molecule. It means that a transition occurred be-
tween the oppositely bent conformations, but, as seen in
Fig. 3, the straight one was avoided. This rotation was
very steady, almost regular.
It gradually slowed down
becoming indistinguishable in the last ﬁve nanoseconds.
After this transition the directions of the bends in the
three trajectories became much closer, and this quasi-
regular motion is apparently responsible for the slow drift
of the rmsd from the TJBa state in Fig. 1. The overall
amplitude of this motion was around 150◦, that is the
initial strong bend noticed in Fig. 3 was nearly opposite
to that ﬁnally established.

The Rotation of the Bending Plane is Not Energy

Driven

The overall character of motion revealed in Fig. 5,
namely, the steady rotation of the bending plane, looks
strange and counter-intuitive. A priori, we would rather
expect to obtain random sampling of diﬀerent bending di-

at the center of the duplex.
It is constructed according to
the Cambridge convention44, namely, the local x direction
points to the major DNA groove along the short axis of the
base-pair, while the local z axis direction is adjacent to the
optimal helicoidal axis. Thus, a zero angle between the two
planes corresponds to the overall bend to the minor groove
exactly at the central base pair.

rections, with the correct one statistically preferred due
to its lower energy. The apparent quasi-regular dynam-
ics exhibited in Fig. 4 might mean that our trajectory
represents a downhill motion along a valley on a poten-
tial energy surface. Its steep borders would separate bent
conformations from the straight one, with the bottom of
this valley slightly inclined towards the preferred bending
direction. In this case all bent conformations, including
incorrect bends, should have been lower in energy than
the straight one.

Figure 6 displays the time evolution of the potential
energy in all three trajectories. It is seen that the energy
dropped during the ﬁrst nanosecond and later remained
stable. No clear correlation is seen between the instanta-
neous magnitude of bending displayed in Fig. 4 and the
potential energy, therefore, one cannot say that straight
states have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent energies than the bent
ones. Neither can we claim that the preferred bending
direction is characterized by lower energy values than
other bends.
In Fig. 6, a slight decrease in energy is
observed during the second half of TJA, but it occurred
when the regular rotation of the bending plane has essen-
tially ﬁnished. On the other hand, the lowest energy dur-
ing the ﬁrst half of the trajectory was observed at around
3.2 ns when the bending direction was completely diﬀer-
ent. Note also that, during the ﬁrst ten nanoseconds,
the traces of TJBa and TJBb go above the last one, al-
though in these cases the correct bending direction has
already established. We have to conclude, therefore, that
the simple energetic al explanation of the observed eﬀect
does not work.

The Minor Groove Proﬁles of Converged Structures

Are Similar But Not Identical

The surface plot in Fig. 7 exhibits the evolution of the
proﬁle of the minor groove during TJA. The initial A-
DNA conformation is characterized by a uniformly wide
minor groove of 13.6 ˚A. It is seen that after the equilibra-
tion period the groove was much narrower, but still wider
than in the canonical B-DNA model. Moreover, a com-
plex proﬁle have emerged with three local widenings at
A-tracts, which is exactly opposite to the expectations.
The two terminal widenings reduced during the ﬁrst ten
nanoseconds whereas the maximum of the middle one
gradually shifted from its 3’ end to 5’ end. This shift
evidently accompanies the rotation of the bending plane
described above.

One can note that the maximal widening of the mi-
nor groove moved for only 2-3 base pair steps, which
is less than a 150◦rotation seen in Fig. 5.
It appears
that, in fact, the maximal widenings and narrowings in
the minor groove proﬁle do not always correspond to the
direction of local bends. The initial bend was directed
towards the minor groove of the upper TAGG tetraplet
where the minor groove was narrowed. The two neigh-
boring widenings are shifted by three base pairs only and

they appear at the opposite sides of the bending plane
which is approximately collinear to the pseudodiad axis
at the center of the middle ATT triplet. In contrast, in
the last structure shown in Figs. 2 and 3 the bending
plane passes exactly through the maximum widening of
the minor groove. The overall rotation, therefore, corre-
sponds to approximately four base pair steps which gives
the observed turn by 150◦. It can be noted, ﬁnally, that
although Fig. 5 indicates that the bending stabilized af-
ter ten nanoseconds, the proﬁle of the minor groove in
Fig. 7 continues to evolve slowly till the very end of the
trajectory.

Figure 8 displays the minor groove proﬁles of the last
average structures from the three trajectories. For TJBa
and TJBb their kinetics was detailed in our ﬁrst report42,
and we only note here that the corresponding proﬁles
shown in Fig. 8 established during the ﬁrst two nanosec-
onds and showed little variations afterwards42. The three
traces evidently exhibit a certain similarity, but do not
coincide. The TJBa and TJBb grooves have the same
number of local narrowings and widenings which diﬀer
slightly between the two both in amplitude and in posi-

7

tion. The TJA proﬁle is similar in the right-hand half of
the ﬁgure. One can notice that the change from TJBa
to TJBb and next to TJA involves the growing widen-
ing at the TTAG tetraplet accompanied by a shift of the
secondary maximum, and looks rather regular and con-
certed. At the opposite half of the structure, the TJA
conformation shows a narrow minor groove without sig-
niﬁcant modulations of the width. This diﬀerence may be
related with the smaller magnitude of the bending in the
case of TJA where the second bending point appeared
from time to time only and was less signiﬁcant than in
the other two trajectories.

Key Helicoidal Parameters Exhibit Consistent

Regular Patterns Only after Window Averaging

Figure 9 shows variation of some helicoidal parameters
along the duplex in the three structures. The two inter
base pair parameters, namely, roll and tilt, are most of-
ten quoted in the literature in relation to the static DNA
curvature. If one ﬁrst takes an ideal straight column of
stacked parallel base pairs and next introduce a non-zero
roll value at a certain step, the structure will bend at this
step towards the major groove, if the roll is positive, and
to the minor groove if it is negative. A similar experi-
ment with the tilt value would result in bending in the
perpendicular direction. It seems obvious that, whatever
the physical origin of the curvature, in a bent double heli-
cal DNA, the roll and tilt values must exhibit systematic
variations phased with the helical turn. Moreover, it is
often assumed that for some short DNA sequences cer-
tain non-zero roll and tilt values are strongly preferred
energetically, which produces static bending when they
are repeated appropriately.

However surprising, although all three average struc-
tures are smoothly curved, only a few supporting signs
for the foregoing paradigm are readily seen in Fig. 9.
For the tilt, the three traces are very dissimilar and the
only feature that repeats is the alteration of its values
between consecutive steps. Namely, if the tilt is low at a
given step it normally goes up at the next one, and vice
versa. In the three average structures, however, these al-
terations are sometimes oppositely phased even in TJBa
and TJBb where the overall structures look particularly
similar.

The same is true for the roll and twist although, in
these cases, some clear sequence preferences do exist.
Note, for instance, that, in all four TpA steps, the roll is
almost always positive and larger than in the neighbor-
ing steps. Paradoxically, two of these TpA steps occur
almost exactly at the inside edge of the curved axis, that
is a high positive roll accompanies the bending in an ex-
actly opposite direction. This paradox is readily resolved
when one looks at the roll values at the neighboring steps.
A TpA step with a high positive roll is normally preceded
or followed by a step with a low negative roll. The higher

ters in the ﬁnal states of TJA, TJBa and TJBb, with window

is the maximum, the lower is the neighboring minimum,
so that the two nearly cancel each other. The other two
TpA steps are found at the outside edge of the helical
axis and their high roll probably contributes to bend-
ing. However, while a more or less repetitive pattern
is observed around the third TpA step, the ﬁrst one ex-
hibits rather dissimilar pictures even for TJBa and TJBb
structures which both have a widened minor groove here.
Also, the roll values at the third TpA step diﬀer consid-
erably between the structures, but do not correlate with
the bending magnitudes.

The twist, tilt, and roll values used for the plots in
Fig. 9 are the so called “global” parameters from the
outputs of the Curves program43. One may argue that
they are not appropriate in the present context since they
are computed by using local directions of already curved
optimal helical axis. However, when “local” values are
used instead, the amplitudes of the alternations in these
proﬁles are only increased.

The last plot in Fig. 9 exhibits the variations of the
propeller twist. Again one sees that its value alternates
between consecutive base pairs, with little phase similar-
ity between the three structures. At the same time, in
this case, a consistent repetitive pattern is evident, with
strong negative propeller values in all A-tracts. These
regular patterns look even more similar than the struc-
tures themselves. For instance, there is no evident diﬀer-
ence between the three traces that would correspond to
that in the minor grove proﬁles in Fig. 8.

The apparent jumping alterations of the helicoidal pa-
rameters along the double helix naturally suggests that
one should try to smooth them out by averaging the
traces in Fig. 9 with a sliding window. Figure 10 shows
the results of such treatment and also includes the corre-
sponding data for the inclination which was, however,
used without the smoothing. The diﬀerence between
Figs. 9 and 10 is rather signiﬁcant. Now all four he-
licoidal parameters considered in Fig. 9 exhibit regular,
sometimes almost sinusoidal, oscillations. The phasing
of these oscillations with the helical turn, however, is not
always evident. The propeller and the inclination both
exhibit approximately 2.5 periods, that is the dominating
Fourier component has a wave length of approximately
ten base pairs corresponding to one helical turn. For the
roll, the dominating wave length apparently corresponds
to 5-6 base pairs, that is a half of a helical turn. When
diﬀerent structures are compared, however, it is seen that
only for propeller the maxima and minima coincide well.
A more complex pattern is observed for the twist, and
one can notice a correlation between its traces and the
minor groove proﬁles shown in Fig. 8. Namely, the twist
is lower in the widenings of the groove and higher in its
narrowings.

These results suggest that the relationship between the
helicoidal parameters and the bending is complex and
cannot be reduced to simple models of roll-like or tilt-
like bends outlined above. Accumulation of the regular
variations revealed in Fig. 10 probably gives the correct

The Distributions of BI and BII Backbone

Conformers in Bent Structures are Surprisingly

Dissimilar

In all three trajectories, dynamics of BI ↔ BII back-
bone transitions was qualitatively similar in a few as-
pects. Consider Fig. 11a, for instance, where the results
are shown for TJA. The overall pattern reveals rather

FIG. 11. Dynamics and ﬁnal distributions of BI and BII
backbone conformers. The BI and BII conformations are dis-
tinguished by the values of two consecutive backbone torsions,
ε and ζ. In a transition they change concertedly from (t,g−)
to (g−,t). The diﬀerence ζ −ε is, therefore, positive in BI state
and negative in BII, and it is used in as a monitoring indicator,
with the corresponding gray scale levels shown on the right
in plate (a). Each base pair step is characterized by a column
consisting of two sub-columns, with the left sub-columns re-
ferring to the sequence written at the top in 5’-3’ direction
from left to right. The right sub-columns refer to the com-
plementary sequence shown at the bottom. (a) Dynamics of

slow dynamics, suggesting that MD trajectories in the
10 ns time scale are not long enough to sample all rele-
vant conformations. A somewhat higher BI ↔ BII activ-
ity was observed during the ﬁrst half of the trajectory,
when the rotation of the bending plane occurred. It is
seen that, in A-tracts, the BII conformers are preferably
found in ApA steps and that they tend to alternate with
BI within the same strand. There are many examples
of concerted BI ↔ BII transitions, when a given step
switches from BII to BI simultaneously with an opposite
transition in one of the neighboring steps. Sometimes
three consecutive steps are involved and, less often, the
opposite strand as well. Many BI ↔ BII transitions are
reversed within hundreds of picoseconds, but there are
also very long-living conformers and sites where either
BI or BII states are preferred. A strong preference of BI
state is observed for all TpT steps, for example. How-
ever, it seems to be the only case when the eﬀect repeats
at a base pair step level. In a few steps where the BII
conformation is preferred this is apparently determined
by a broader sequence context.

The corresponding data for TJBa and TJBb were in-
cluded in our ﬁrst report and they revealed the same
qualitative features42. It was very surprising for us, how-
ever, that, in spite of the good convergence in terms of
the overall bent shape of the molecule, the three trajec-
tories gave rather dissimilar distributions of BI and BII
conformers along the sequence. Fig. 11b compares these
distribution in the ﬁnal backbone conformations in the
three trajectories. There are 14 non TpT steps where the
BI conformation is found in all three structures. How-
ever, since our trajectories started from BI states, this
number hardly tells us something. On the other hand,
the number of BII conformers found in each structure and
in each strand is similar and roughly corresponds to 25%
of phosphate groups. Assuming that the BII states are
evenly distributed in the sequence one gets the expecta-
tion value of 0.75 for the number of cases when the BII
conformer should be found in the same base pair step
in all three structures. The observed number of such
sites is three. Note, however, that they all are found in
A-strands of A-tracts where, as noted above, the BII con-
formers tend to alternate. This, together with the strong
preference of TpT steps for BI, increases the probability
of matching.

These results suggest that the relationship between the
bending of the DNA double helix and the BI ↔ BII back-
bone transitions, if any, is loose in the sense that a given
bent shape does not impose a ﬁxed BII distribution upon
the backbone.

DISCUSSION

This study gives the ﬁrst example of a successful im-
plementation of the general strategy outlined in Theoret-
ical Background. Namely, we showed that the minimal

model of B-DNA, which is biased only by the nucleotide
sequence, in dynamics, reproducibly converges to a single
state characterized by an ensemble of similar statically
bent conformations. The eﬀect has been demonstrated
here for one sequence only. Moreover, this sequence
was speciﬁcally constructed rather than taken from ex-
perimental studies. Nevertheless, the sequence motive
AnTAG used in construction was found in the center of
the ﬁrst bent DNA fragment studied experimentally3.
In addition, the character of bending in the computed
conformations, notably, its direction with respect to the
A-tracts, and modulations of the groove width, quali-
tatively agree with the rules derived from experiments.
These observations validate an attempt to make the next
step of the above strategy, namely, below we try to dis-
close the mechanism responsible for the bending within
the framework of the minimal model. We believe that,
in spite of the obvious limitations of this model, its main
features responsible for the bending correspond to real-
ity. At the same time, the real situation is certainly more
complex.

Results Poorly Agree with Earlier Theories of

Bending

All theories proposed during the last 20 years to ex-
plain intrinsic bends in DNA double helices agree with
some experimental observations and disagree with the
other and, probably, each of them continues to attract
some proponents. Here we compare our results with the
most popular models of bending regardless of their ex-
perimental validation. Comparisons with experimental
data have been the subject of many reviews1,9,10,11,12,13.
The wedge model of DNA bending27 resulted from
merging of ideas developed in seventies to explain the
ability of a double helix to wrap around nucleosome par-
ticles. The ﬁrst idea was that this can occur due to kinks
of the helical axis phased with the helical screw46,30, with
kinks implying destacking of base pairs in fable points
in order to maintain perfect stacking elsewhere. The
second idea was that the double helix can be smoothly
bent, without destacking, by small deformations in ev-
ery base pair step47. The wedge model merges the two
by postulating that, in every speciﬁc dinucleotide, the
preferred stacking of bases is slightly non-parallel and
this causes bending in the same way as kinks do. It can
be further developed by increasing the number of wedge
degrees of freedom, by considering triplets, tetraplets,
and so forth instead of dinucleotides, and by assuming
that the non-zero average wedges result from random
sampling from asymmetrical energy valleys around lo-
cal energy minima, rather than from minimum energy
conﬁgurations48. Depending upon the speciﬁc wedge pa-
rameters, this model can place the curvature inside A-
tracts or between them48,49 and also explain bending in
non A-tract sequences29. For the present discussion, it
is convenient to unite all such mechanisms in one group

10

characterized by the tacit emphasis upon the speciﬁc base
pair stacking preferences as the source of the DNA bend-
ing.

The results shown in Figs. 9 and 10 obviously dis-
agree with these views. There is little similarity between
matching dinucleotides in the same structure and, more-
over, base pair steps put in the same sequence context in
three closely similar bent conformations exhibit broadly
diﬀerent helical parameters. The last observation means
that even a generalized wedge model with dinucleotide
blocks replaced by triplets, tetraplets, and so forth, would
disagree with our results.

The junction model28 postulates that there is a distinct
speciﬁc A-tract form of the double helix characterized by
a stronger inclination of base pairs with respect to the
helical axis than in the normal B-DNA. In this case, pla-
nar stacking at the junction between the two structures
would result in a kink of the helical axis. Formally, such
geometry can also be obtained with the generalized wedge
model above, but the junction theory puts an emphasis
upon the speciﬁc A-tract form of DNA as the principal
physical cause of bending. Its structure can be due to co-
operative interactions in long DNA stretches and its en-
vironment. Within the framework of the junction model,
particular roles were sometimes attributed to bifurcated
hydrogen bonds17, the water spine in the minor groove32,
or the NH2 groups of adenines31.

It is evident that the junction model also poorly agrees
In dynamics, conformations, both
with our results.
smoothly bent and kinked at the two insertions between
the A-tracts, are observed periodically. The kinks, how-
ever, are not centered at the boundaries between A-tracts
and the ﬂanking sequences, and they are not sharp. In
such conformations, A-tracts are less bent than regions
between them, that is the bend is localized but still
smooth. In Fig. 10 the inclination shows smooth oscil-
lations, even without window averaging, with no kinks.
It decreases from 5’ to 3’ ends of A-tracts, and since
the 3’ ends of A-tracts are dephased and positioned dif-
ferently with respect to the bending plane, no evident
relationship to bending can be readily seen. All helical
parameters vary along the sequence so that there is no
A-tract fragment where they repeat at two consecutive
steps. Thus, although the structures are bent, the spe-
ciﬁc regular A-tract structure is not seen, as well as the
“random B-DNA”, though, which are the two key com-
ponents of the junction model.

The third model, which was ﬁrst mentioned in the con-
text of the junction theory50, but became popular only
in the recent years51, attributes the cause of bending to
solvent counterions. If they are speciﬁcally bound by mi-
nor grooves of A-tracts, in a phased sequence, phosphate
groups would appear partially neutralized at one side of
the double helix, and the repulsion between the oppo-
site phosphates would bend DNA towards minor grooves
of A-tracts. The very fact that the minimal model of
B-DNA, without explicit counterions, produces static
bends,
in good agreement with experiments, strongly

suggests that the counterions hardly play a key role in
the A-tract induced bending.

At the same time, our results do not contradict less
speciﬁc non-local theories of A-tract bending. The mod-
iﬁed junction model52 assumes that the deformations at
the boundary between the two conformations can prop-
agate for several base pair steps. The A-tracts in the
sequence studied here may be too short for their inge-
nious structure to establish. The second such theory53
proposed that the bending is caused by the modulations
of the minor groove. Really, the double helix is usu-
ally bent towards the major groove at the minor groove
widenings, and in the opposite direction at its narrow-
ings. In TJA, for instance, this relationship is maintained
during the rotation of the bending plane. Sometimes,
however, the double helix straightens and remains un-
bent during nanoseconds, while the minor groove proﬁle
does not change42.

It is understood, however, that the last two non-local
models are incomplete. Actually, they cannot be veri-
ﬁed or disproved because the issue of the physical origin
of bending is tacitly dropped. Simple geometrical con-
siderations dictate that the grooves must be narrower
at the inside edge of the bend54. One may postulate,
therefore, that groove modulations cause bending or, vice
versa, that it is bending that causes groove modulations,
but the physical origin of the phenomenon remains ob-
scure. Similarly, the modiﬁed junction model essentially
discards the essence of the original theory, which consid-
ers the speciﬁc poly-dA structure as the source of the
bend.
If the “boundary deformations” can exist with-
out the structures and boundaries themselves one should
look for another force that maintains these deformations.
Generally speaking, the results presented here are best
interpreted if one assumes that there is an external force
that imposes a bent shape upon the double helix as a
series of mechanical constraints. The double helix is al-
lowed to move, but so that these constraints would re-
main fulﬁlled. Thus, the bases can change their mu-
tual orientation and the backbone can switch between
BI and BII conformations, but the overall proportion of
the BII conformers remains constant, and ﬂuctuations of
helical parameters in the neighboring base pair steps tend
to compensate.

Possible Physical Origin of Spontaneous Static

Bends in Double Helices

The hypothesis outlined below is based upon our com-
putational results as well as upon analysis of well-known
experimental data. Although it does not answer all un-
clear questions concerning DNA bending we consider it
most likely and describe it here for discussion and further
investigation.

Let us ﬁrst ask the following simple geometric ques-
tion: “What is the shortest line that joins two points on

11

a surface of a cylinder?” To answer it, one should ﬁrst cut
the cylinder parallel to its axis, unfold its surface onto a
plane, join the two points by a straight line and then fold
the surface back upon the cylinder. The resultant curve
represents an interval of a spiral trace with a constant
inclination to the cylinder axis. Now consider an ideal
canonical B-DNA model of a double helix. The stacked
base pairs form the core of a cylinder and the sugar-
phosphate backbone forms an ideal spiral trace on its
surface, that is the shortest line that joins the “surface”
nitrogens N1/N9 of the bases.
If we now assume that
the backbone is a stiﬀ elastic that can be characterized
by a certain speciﬁc length, we are obliged to conclude
that this model implicitly assumes that the backbone is
stretched and tends to reduce its length on the surface of
this cylinder. Our last question is: “What would happen
if the preferred backbone length appeared to be longer
that allowed by the canonical model?” A simple answer
is: it would try to extend by pushing bases. They can ac-
commodate this extention within the framework of a reg-
ular helical structure by increasing the helical twist and
changing other helical parameters. This option, however,
is opposed by the loss in the stacking energy and, when
it becomes diﬃcult to extend in this way, the backbone
will try to deviate from the ideal spiral trace.
In this
case the the grooves on the surface of the Watson-Crick
double helix can no longer maintain a constant width.

It seems possible to assume that, in physiological con-
ditions, the equilibrium speciﬁc length of the DNA back-
bone is actually larger than that allowed by a regular
B-DNA structure with the average helical twist of 34.5◦.
Its further extention is opposed by the limit of the tol-
erance of the pase pair stacking and, as a result, the
backbone appears “frustrated” and is forced to wander
on the cylindrical surface formed by base pair stack. The
ideal parallel stacking has to be perturbed and we be-
lieve that it is this eﬀect that eventually bends the dou-
ble helix. Modulations of the DNA grooves, which is
a well-known ubiquitous feature of the single crystal B-
DNA structures, is a natural indicator of this particular
state of the backbone. It is observed for very diﬀerent se-
quences as an apparently general attribute of the B-DNA
form in physiological conditions. Thus, if we had to de-
cide whether the DNA backbone in stretched, relaxed or
compressed by looking only at the single crystal B-DNA
structures, we would be obliged to conclude that the ﬁrst
option looks unlikely, the second is possible, while the
third is the most probable. A compressed backbone is
more likely to cause smooth groove modulations found in
experimental structures than a relaxed one, which would
rather be controlled by the local sequence eﬀects.

Let us consider an ideal B-DNA model, with planar
base pairs perpendicular to the helical axis, and try
to imagine how wandering of the backbone traces can
emerge. For simplicity, we ﬁrst consider the helical twist
as the only variable parameter. Obviously, by smoothly
increasing and decreasing the twist we obtain, respec-
tively, narrowings and widenings of the minor groove.

The desired backbone waving emerges, and a larger its
length can be accommodated on the same cylindrical
surface.
It is easy to see, however, that, if the paral-
lel stacking is maintained, the backbone must be com-
pressed when the twist is reduced and stretched in the
opposite phase. In reality, however, the backbone is stiﬀ
and it cannot be compressed signiﬁcantly, therefore, it is
the stacking that suﬀers when the twist is reduced. Al-
though this description is simplistic, and other base pair
degrees of freedom in addition to the twist can contribute
to the wandering, it captures the essence of the under-
lying mechanics. In the widenings of the minor groove,
where the twist is reduced, the backbone pushes oﬀ the
neighboring base pairs at C1’ atoms, causing various per-
turbations of the parallel stacking. On average, they are
likely to deviate the helical axis towards the major groove
because C1’ atoms are at the minor groove side. These
perturbations are delocalized and involve rolling, tilting,
as well as other relative motions of base pairs, and there
is an ensemble of orientations that fulﬁll the constraints
imposed by the backbone lengths, rather than a single
preferred bent conformation. The modulations of the
minor groove width and the bending of the double helix
appear related, as was suggested earlier53, because they
represent two consequences of a single cause. They are
related as brothers rather than as a parent and a child
and, probably, are not bound to always appear together.
The major component of the backbone stiﬀness is
the electrostatic repulsion between the charged phos-
phate groups. Even though this repulsion is shielded
by water and counterions, the experiments where bend-
ing in B-DNA was induced by speciﬁc neutralization
of phosphates55 proved that they are not shielded even
when separated by two helical turns. Complete neutral-
ization, therefore, is hardly imaginable. The local elec-
tric ﬁeld around a pair of neighboring phosphates in the
same strand is created by all surrounding charges, in-
cluding the phosphates of the opposite strand, and it fa-
vors maximal possible separation between Pn and Pn+1.
In B-DNA, this distance is close to the absolute maxi-
mum, which is achieved by putting all relevant backbone
torsions except one in the trans conﬁguration56. The
maximal extention gives the ground energy state with
the Pn − Pn+1 distance around 7.7 ˚A. The corresponding
thermodynamic average for a free backbone in solution
is D(T, ǫ) < 7.7 ˚A, where T is the temperature, and
ǫ is the eﬀective dielectric constant that depends upon
the concentration of counterions.
In the single crystal
structures, the largest Pn − Pn+1 distances observed are
in the range of 7.3 – 7.6 ˚A suggesting that there are
no prohibitive steric obstacles for a completely extended
backbone. At the same time, the distances most com-
monly found are around 6.7 ˚A while in the ﬁber canon-
ical structure it is 6.5 ˚A. Apparently, with normal tem-
perature in physiological conditions D(T, ǫ) >
∼ 6.7, and
the backbone is forced to wander. D(T, ǫ) should be
a decreasing function of both arguments, therefore, the
backbone stiﬀness and, accordingly, the curvature should

12

decrease as the temperature grows and/or as the phos-
phate shielding is improved by increasing the ionic force.
These two non sequence-speciﬁc eﬀects have been found
in experiments8. With D(T, ǫ) ≈ 6.5 the backbone re-
laxes and the phenomenon of DNA bending vanishes.

According to this hypothesis, the transition of A-tracts
in a speciﬁc DNA form is not an indispensable prerequi-
site of the bending. Moreover, it suggests that the regular
poly-dA structure may not exist in solution because, with
the average twist increased to 36◦, the backbone is, pos-
sibly, still compressed and continues to wander, although
with a longer characteristic wave lengths. The structures
of short A-tracts computed here are rather variable and
it is not clear how they can be extended to longer poly-
dA double helices. We believe that the A-tracts rather
label the regions where higher twist values are allowed
by the base stacking interactions. The backbone prefers
to compress the minor groove here, thus ﬁxing the phase
of its modulations along the double helix.
In random
and homopolymer sequences the minor groove probably
also narrows and widens, but the corresponding maxima
and minima can migrate along the double helix in a way
similar to that observed here during the rotation of the
bending plane in TJA.

Our model considers the bending of a DNA double
helix as a deformation imposed upon the stem of the
stacked base pairs by interactions external to it. The
bases are forced to “forget” their preferred stacking ori-
entations and look for a possibility to maintain the over-
all structure by sampling the orientations at the limit of
destacking. At the same time, it is the broad “tolerance”
of the base pair stacking that makes all this game pos-
sible. If true, this theory gives a slightly diﬀerent over-
all view of the DNA molecule in physiological conditions
and entails important biological consequences. Notably,
it suggests that the local DNA structure is not simply
determined by the stacking preferences of base pairs in
dinucleotides, trinucleotide, and so forth. The two wav-
ing backbone proﬁles on the surface of the helix impose a
medium range context upon the local base pair stacking
because the phases of these modulations can well corre-
late over several DNA turns. This makes possible mutual
dependence of local conformations in sites separated by
considerable DNA stretches. Fine tuning of phases of
these modulations may be the function of single short A-
tracts as well as of some regulatory proteins. The degree
of the backbone compression is connected with super-
coiling and can be controlled in this way, which gives
yet another possible instrument of structural regulation.
One may note also that this theory oﬀers a uniﬁed model
which explains static bends in A-tract and non A-tract
sequences as well as the bending induced by the negative
supercoiling in circular DNA.

Conclusions

The static curvature spontaneously emerges in free MD
simulations of an atom level molecular model of B-DNA
double helix, with the nucleotide sequence as a single
structural bias. Convergence to similar statically bent
states have been demonstrated in three independent MD
trajectories of 10-20 ns. The bending direction and its
magnitude are in good agreement with experimental ob-
servations. Unexpectedly, the three computed MD struc-
tures exhibit a striking microscopic heterogeneity as re-
gards variations of helical and conformational parameters
along the molecule. Based upon the computational re-
sults as well as the literature experimental data a new
possible mechanism of bending in a double helical DNA
is proposed. It postulates that, in physiological condi-
tions, the equilibrium speciﬁc length of the DNA back-
bone is larger than is admissible in the regular B-DNA
form, which forces it to fold in a wavy trace on the cylin-
drical surface of the double helix. This results in mod-
ulations of the minor groove width, slight asymmetrical
destacking of base pairs at the groove widenings and,
eventually, in bending of the DNA molecule.

Methods

Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed
with the internal coordinate method (ICMD)57,58 includ-
ing special technique for ﬂexible sugar rings59. The so-
called minimal B-DNA model was used39,40 which con-
sists of a double helix with the minor groove ﬁlled with
explicit water.
It does not involve explicit counterions
and damps long range electrostatic interactions in a semi-
empirical way by using linear distance scaling of the elec-
trostatic constant and reduction of phosphate charges.
The DNA model was same as in earlier reports,39,40
namely, all torsions were free as well as bond angles cen-
tered at sugar atoms, while other bonds and angles were
ﬁxed, and the bases held rigid. Molecular dynamics cal-
culations were carried out with a time step of 10 fsec and
the eﬀective inertia of planar sugar angles increased by
140 amu·˚A2 as explained elsewhere39. The coordinates
were saved once in 2.5 ps. AMBER9435,60 force ﬁeld and
atom parameters were used with TIP3P water61 and no
cut oﬀ schemes.

The initial conformation for TJBa was prepared by
vacuum energy minimization starting from the ﬁber
B-DNA model constructed from the published atom
coordinates41. The subsequent hydration protocol to ﬁll
up the minor groove39 normally adds around 16 water
molecules per base pair. The starting state for TJBb was
obtained by energy minimizing an equilibrated straight
structure taken from the initial phase of TJBa. The ini-
tial conformation for TJA was prepared by hydrating
the minor groove of the corresponding A-DNA model41
without the preliminary energy minimization. In TJA,

13

the necessary number of water molecules was added after
equilibration to make it equal to that in TJBa and TJBb.
The heating and equilibration protocols were same as
before39,40. During the runs, after every 200 ps, water
positions were checked in order to identify those pene-
trating into the major groove and those completely sepa-
rated. These molecules, if found, were removed and next
re-introduced in simulations by putting them with zero
velocities at random positions around the hydrated du-
plex, so that they could readily re-join the core system.
This procedure assures stable conditions, notably, a con-
stant number of molecules in the minor groove hydration
cloud and the absence of water in the major groove, which
is necessary for fast sampling40. The interval of 200 ps
between the checks is small enough to assure that on aver-
age less then one molecule is repositioned and, therefore,
the perturbation introduced is considered negligible.

APPENDIX

This section contains comments from anonymous ref-
erees of a peer-review journal where this and a closely
related paper entitled “Molecular Dynamics Studies of
Sequence-directed Curvature in Bending Locus of Try-
panosome Kinetoplast DNA” has been considered for
publication, but rejected.

A. Journal of Molecular Biology

1. First referee

These companion manuscripts describe a series of
molecular dynamics trajectories obtained for DNA se-
quences containing arrangements of oligo dA - oligo dT
motifs implicated in intrinsic DNA bending. Unlike pre-
vious MD studies of intrinsically bent DNA sequences,
these calculations omit explicit consideration of the role

15

of counterions. Because recent crystallographic studies
of A-tract-like DNA sequences have attributed intrinsic
bending to the localization of counterions in the minor
groove, a detailed understanding of the underlying ba-
sis of A-tract-dependent bending and its relationship to
DNA-counterion interactions would be an important con-
tribution.

Although the MD calculations seem to have been car-
ried out with close attention to detail, both manuscripts
suﬀer from some troubling problems, speciﬁcally:

The DNA sequence in question is a 25-bp deoxy-
oligonucleotide that contains 3 A/T tracts. Two of these
are arranged in phase with the helix screw with the third
tract inverted with respect to the other two. Extrapo-
lating from available experimental data, this sequence is
expected to confer some degree of intrinsic bending. The
main focus of this manuscript is the comparison of data
obtained for an MD trajectory computed from an A-form
starting conformation (TJA) with two other trajectories
that begin with B-form structures (TJBa and TJBb).

Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in behavior and in time-averaged
helical parameters are observed for the TJA trajectory
compared with both TJBa and TJBb, suggesting that
the structures are not fully equilibrated. This is partic-
ularly evident in the computed bending direction, which
varies dramatically during early times in the TJA trajec-
tory. Even after 15 ns, when the orientations of bend-
ing planes appear to have approached asymptotic values,
the TJA plane is displaced by between 30 and 60 degrees
from those of TJBa and TJBb, which are quite similar
to one another. This fact strongly suggests that the MD-
simulation results depend nontrivially on initial condi-
tions, even after 15-20 ns, which calls into question most
of the results obtained from the computed trajectories.

2. Second referee

Dr. Mazur reports the results of MD simulations
of DNA 25-mers sequences that contain three phased
A-tracts. He believes that he has obtained the ﬁrst
model system in which properly directed static curvature
emerges spontaneously in conditions excluding any ini-
tial bias except for base pair sequence. He observes that
the ensemble of curved conformations reveals signiﬁcant
microscopic heterogeneity, which he believes is in contra-
diction to existing theoretical models of DNA bending.
In CAM110/00 he performs a series of simulations on a
DNA fragment that has not been shown experimentally
to bend in solution. In this case the DNA sequence was
chosen based on its propensity to adopt a characteris-
tic structure during simulations. In CAM167/00 he per-
forms a similar investigation on B-DNA fragment com-
posed of a sequence that has been shown experimentally
to bend. My view is these two papers should be combined
as one, and the review will treat them as one.

I found this paper to be interesting and possibly wor-

thy of publication in JMB, even as I took issue with a
substantial portion of it. The basic premise of the pa-
per is that a model lacking realistic electrostatics can
provide meaningful information about long range DNA
conformation. In Mazur’s model, long range electrostatic
interactions are dampened and phosphate charges are at-
tenuated.

I had some concerns about the basic rationale for the
non-electrostatic model.
I initially assumed that it’s
greater simplicity would allow longer trajectories, etc.
But the trajectories of Dr. Mazur are not substantially
longer than those described by Beveridge, Pettitte, etc.
And in fact that seems not to be the rationale. Dr. Mazur
believes that full atom force ﬁelds, with explicit ions,
give less realistic results than his electrostatic-attenuated
model. In particular he says that full atom force ﬁelds
give slightly overwound DNA, which camouﬂages DNA
bending. What is the cause of this? A problem in the
force ﬁeld? Why not ﬁx that instead of going the non-
electrostatic route? I am not comfortable enough with
the world of MD pass judgment on this issue, but think
someone who is should evaluate that prior to publication.
I just went back and re-read Diekmann’s classic 1985
JMB paper [Diekmann, S., & Wang, J. C. ”On the se-
quence determinants and ﬂexibility of the kinetoplast
DNA fragment with abnormal gel electrophoretic mobil-
ities” (1985) J. Mol. Biol. 186, 1-11.] Diekmann shows
clearly that the electrophoretic anomaly of kinetoplast
DNA decreases with increasing Na, and increases very
dramatically with increasing Mg. His experiments seem
well-conceived , well-conducted and well-analyzed. For
example he implants a temperature sensor within his gels
to insure constant, ﬁxed temperature. One has to be-
lieve Diekmann’s results. My fundamental problem with
Mazur’s model is that it cannot account for experimen-
tal data. How can bending be cation-dependent, but the
mechanism not be electrostatic in nature?

Mazur does concede that experimentally ”curvature is
reduced in high salt, but for some sequences it is in-
creased in the presence of divalent metal ions” (cites
Diekmann).
[page 2 MS CODE CAM110/00]. But the
implication here is that the observation of Diekmann is
not general to all A-tracts. The next sentence of the
manuscript may be read as conﬁrming that the cation
eﬀect is not general, but is length and composition de-
pendent (the text is a little confusing here). However
the Woo and Crothers citation, used as support for that,
does not discuss the cation eﬀect. If there are data some-
where suggesting that the cation eﬀects are not general,
they should be cited and discussed. That would really
increase the strength of Mazur’s argument. If not, the
text should be clariﬁed.

An additional issue that is not illuminated much here
is the comparison of Mazur’s model with the results of
x-ray crystallography. In crystals of oligonucleotides, A-
tracts are straight (”less prone to bending than other se-
quences” is rather understating it). To accommodate this
observation, Dickerson (JMB 1994) proposed a model in

els rather than the last word on the physical origin of
intrinsic bends.

Re: measurement of the groove width: Is the some rea-

versions ﬁt a surface to the groove, rather than just mea-

which A-tract DNA curvature results from roll-bending
of non-A-tracts, and linear A-tracts. Crothers (JMB
1994) is contemptuous of that model, and believes that
the linear conformations of A-tracts observed thus far
in crystals are not those associated with the curvature
’observed’ in gel mobility experiments.
In fact such a
discrepancy between dilute solution (where intramolec-
ular forces would dominate) and condensed states (such
as crystals, where intermolecular forces dominate) is ex-
pected if long-range electrostatics play a key role in cur-
vature. Those long range forces are turned oﬀ in Mazur’s
model.
(He does seem to allude to the crystallogra-
phy/solution discrepancy on page 19). So again his model
does not account for experimental data.

As an aside: Mazur believes that groove narrowing
and bending are coupled. How does one then explain the
observation that A-tracts in crystals have narrow minor
grooves, yet are not bent?

Finally, some aspects of Mazur’s (combined) model

seems to be inconsistent and self-contradictory.
model (as I understand it), (1) electrostatic repulsion be-
tween adjacent phosphate groups drives helical twisting,
(2) A-tracts are regions where higher helical twist is facil-
itated by lower stacking energies in comparison to those
of G-C base pairs, (3) higher helical twist narrows the mi-
nor groove, and (4) groove narrowing is somehow related
to axial curvature (this is a little unclear; the descrip-
tion ”as brothers rather than a parent and a child” did
not enlighten me). This model has certain attractive fea-
tures, [the idea that electrostatic repulsion between adja-
cent phosphate groups drives helical twisting while stack-
ing opposes it was previously presented by Alex Rich
in 1992 in a chapter of Structure & Function, Volume
I: Nucleic Acids pp. 107-125 (from a Sarma meeting)]
but some deﬁciencies also. If electrostatic repulsion be-
tween adjacent phosphate groups drives helical twisting,
then how can correct values of helical twist be obtained
with attenuated phosphate charges? Or restated: Does
this model not ascribe electrostatic forces as the ultimate
cause of static bends, contradicting the non-electrostatic
assumption? And I just checked in one crystal struc-
ture and found a place where OP to OP (phosphate oxy-
gens, where the negative charge resides) across the minor
groove are less than those between adjacent phosphates.
How can electrostatic repulsion between adjacent phos-
phate groups drive other phosphate groups together like
that, especially if stacking forces are working in opposi-
tion? How can one understand such phenomena without
explicitly considering electrostatic interactions?

Although the bulk of this review might appear rather
critical, a model can be useful even if it does not account
for all data. And that may be the case here. If Mazur has
indeed obtained the ﬁrst model system where properly di-
rected static curvature emerges spontaneously, then his
model clearly has utility. If a reviewer who specializes in
MD simulations (not this reviewer) would conﬁrm that,
and support the utility of the approach, then publication
may be in order. However I would like the paper more if

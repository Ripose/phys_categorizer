The recently introduced method of excess collisions (MEC) is modiﬁed to estimate diﬀusion-
controlled reaction times inside systems of arbitrary size. The resulting MEC-E equations contain a
set of empirical parameters, which have to be calibrated in numerical simulations inside a test system
of moderate size. Once this is done, reaction times of systems of arbitrary dimensions are derived
by extrapolation, with an accuracy of 10 to 15 percent. The achieved speed up, when compared to
explicit simulations of the reaction process, is increasing proportional to the extrapolated volume
of the cell.

INTRODUCTION

Diﬀusion controlled bio-chemical reactions play a cen-
tral role in keeping any organism alive [1, 2]: The trans-
port of molecules through cell membranes, the passage
of ions across the synaptic gap, or the search carried out
by drugs on the way to their protein receptors are pre-
dominantly diﬀusive processes. Further more, essentially
all of the biological functions of DNA are performed by
proteins that interact with speciﬁc DNA sequences [3, 4],
and these reactions are diﬀusion-controlled.

However, it has been realized that some proteins are
able to ﬁnd their speciﬁc binding sites on DNA much
more rapidly than is ‘allowed’ by the diﬀusion limit [1, 5].
It is therefore generally accepted that some kind of facil-
itated diﬀusion must take place in these cases. Several
mechanisms, diﬀering in details, have been proposed. All
of them essentially involve two steps: the binding to a
random non-speciﬁc DNA site and the diﬀusion (sliding)
along the DNA chain. These two steps may be reiter-
ated many times before proteins actually ﬁnd their tar-
get, since the sliding is occasionally interrupted by dis-
sociation. Berg [5] and Zhou [6] have provided thorough
(but somewhat sophisticated) theories that allow esti-
mates for the resulting reaction rates. Recently, Halford
and Marko have presented a comprehensive review on
this subject and proposed a remarkably simple and semi-
quantitative approach that explicitly contains the mean
sliding length as a parameter of the theory [7]. This ap-
proach has been reﬁned and put onto a rigorous base in
a recent work by the authors [8]. A plethora of scaling
regimes have been studied for a large range of chain den-
sities and protein-chain aﬃnities in a recent work by Hu
et al. [9].

The numerical treatment of such a reaction is eﬃ-
ciently done with the method of excess collisions [10]
(MEC), where the reverse process (protein departs from

∗Electronic address: merlitz@gmx.de
†Electronic address: cxwu@jingxian.xmu.edu.cn

the binding site and propagates toward the periphery
of the cell) is simulated. This approach delivers ex-
act results and a signiﬁcant speed up when compared
to straight forward simulations. Unfortunately, once
very large systems are under investigation, the numer-
ical treatment of the DNA chain (whose length is pro-
portional to the volume of the cell) quickly turns into
a bottleneck, since the MEC approach requires the con-
struction of the cell in its full extent. Realistic cell models
have to deal with thermal ﬂuctuations of the chain and
its hydrodynamic interaction, thereby imposing a strict
limit to the size that can be managed.
In the present
work we demonstrate how to implement a modiﬁcation
of the MEC approach that allows to simulate a test sys-
tem of reasonable size, followed by an extrapolation to
cells of arbitrary size.

After a deﬁnition of the problem in Sect. 2.1, the MEC
approach is brieﬂy summarized in Sect. 2.2. In Sect. 2.3
the numerical implementation of facilitated diﬀusion is
presented, and 2.4 delivers an analytical estimate for the
reaction time. As a preparation for the random walk
simulations, the chain is constructed in Sect. 3 and the
speciﬁc recurrence times are evaluated inside a small test
system (Sect. 4).
In Sect. 5, random walk simulations
are carried out in order to construct the empirical MEC-
E equations. These are then employed to extrapolate
the reaction times to cells of much larger dimensions in
Sect. 6. A comparison with exact solutions (in the case
of free diﬀusion) and the analytical estimate of Sect. 2.4
suggests that the MEC-E approach delivers an accuracy
of 10 to 15 percent with a speed up of several orders of
magnitude.

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1. Deﬁnition of the system

As a cell we deﬁne a spherical volume of radius R,
containing a chain (’DNA’) of length L and a speciﬁc
binding target of radius Ra. The target is located in the
middle of the chain, that in turn coincides with the cen-

ter of the cell. The state of the system is well deﬁned
with the position of a random walker (’protein’), which
can either diﬀuse freely inside the cell or, temporarily,
associate with the chain to propagate along the chain’s
contour (the numerical realization of this process is dis-
cussed in detail in Sect. 2.3). The distance of the walker
from the center deﬁnes the (radial) reaction coordinate
r. We shall further denote the periphery of the central
target (at r = Ra) as state A and the periphery of the
cell (r = R) as state B. To be investigated is the average
reaction time τBA the walker needs to propagate from B
to A as a function of the binding aﬃnity between walker
and chain.

2.2. Method of excess collisions (MEC)

The MEC approach was presented in its full generality
elsewhere [10, 11]. In short, it allows to determine the
reaction time τBA while simulating the back reaction A
→ B (average reaction time: τAB) using the relation

τBA = (Ncoll + 1) · τR − τAB .

(1)

The walker starts at the center (r(t = 0) = 0) and propa-
gates towards the periphery (r(t = τAB) = R), a process
that is much faster than its reversal (τAB ≪ τBA). On its
way to B, the walker may repeatedly return back to A;
such an event is called collision, and Ncoll stands for the
average number of collisions. τR is the recurrence time
and evaluated via

where we have deﬁned the speciﬁc recurrence time

τR = ˜τR Veﬀ (R) ,

˜τR ≡

τ ∗

Veﬀ (Ra)

,

a quantity, which is derived from simulations of the re-
currence time τ ∗
R within a small test system of the size
of the central target (Sect. 4). The eﬀective volume is
deﬁned as

Veﬀ ≡

(cid:20)
and depends upon the energy of the walker U (r) and
hence the implementation of the binding potential be-
tween walker and chain.

(cid:21)

2.3. Simple model for facilitated diﬀusion of
DNA-binding proteins

The nonspeciﬁc binding of the walker to the chain is

accounted for by the attractive step potential

2

where s is the shortest distance between walker and
chain. This deﬁnes a pipe with radius rc around the
chain contour that the walker is allowed to enter freely
from outside, but to exit only with the probability

p = exp(−Eo/kBT ) ,

(6)

where kBT is the Boltzmann factor, otherwise it is re-
ﬂected back inside the chain. We may therefore denote
p as exit probability. This quantity allows to deﬁne the
equilibrium constant K of the two phases, the free and
the non-speciﬁcally bound protein, according to

K ≡

,

(cid:19)

(7)

c L is the geometric volume of the chain.

where c is the concentration of free proteins and σ the
linear density of non-speciﬁcally bound proteins. Vc =
π r2
It should
be noted that in our previous publication [10], σ was de-
ﬁned as σ = c Vc/(p L), with the disadvantage of being
non-zero in case of vanishing protein-chain interaction
(p = 1). The present choice deﬁnes σ as the excess con-
centration of proteins along the chain contour and leads
to a vanishing sliding-length (Eq. 14) in case of free dif-
fusion.

The speciﬁc binding site is a spherical volume, located
in the middle of the chain and of identical radius, i.e.
Ra = rc. Applying the walker-chain potential Eq. (5),
the eﬀective volume Eq. (4) of the cell becomes

Veﬀ (R) = V + Vc

and that of the central target is simply

2.4. Analytical estimate for the reaction time and
deﬁnition of the sliding length

In case of free diﬀusion and for a spherical cell, Szabo
et al. have evaluated the exact solution for the time a
walker needs to reach the radius Ra, after starting at the
periphery R, yielding [12]

Here, D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.
In presence of the
chain, exact solutions are known for simple geometrical
setups only [5], but as discussed elsewhere [8], it is still
possible to approximate the reaction time using an an-
alytical approach, once certain conditions are satisﬁed.
The resulting expression is

and D1d and D3d being the diﬀusion coeﬃcients in
sliding-mode and free diﬀusion, respectively. Generally,
the equilibrium constant K has to be determined in sim-
ulations of a (small) test system, containing a piece of
chain without speciﬁc binding site. In the present model,
K is known analytically via Eq. (7). If the step-size dr
of the random walker is equal both inside and outside
the chain (the direction of the step being arbitrary), we
further have

This variable has got the dimension of length; as we have
pointed out in [8], it corresponds to the average sliding
length of the protein along the DNA contour in the model
of Halford and Marko [7] and we shall henceforth use the
same expression for ξ. In case of free diﬀusion (p = 1),
the sliding length is zero and Eq. (11) simpliﬁes to

τBA(ξ = 0) =

R3

,

(15)

which equals Szabo’s result Eq. (10) in leading order of
R/Ra.

3. NUMERICAL MODEL

In order to approximate the real biological situation,
the DNA was modeled as a chain of straight segments of
equal length l0. Its mechanical stiﬀness was introduced
in terms of a bending energy associated with each chain
joint:

Eb = kBT α θ2 ,

(16)

where α represents the dimensionless stiﬀness parame-
ter, and θ the bending angle. The numerical value of α
deﬁnes the persistence length (lp), i.e. the “stiﬀness” of
the chain. The excluded volume eﬀect was taken into
account by introducing the eﬀective chain radius rc. The
conformations of the chain, with distances between non-
adjacent segments smaller than 2rc, were forbidden. The
target of speciﬁc binding was assumed to lie exactly in
the middle of the DNA. The whole chain was packed in
a spherical volume (cell) of radius R in such a way that
the target occupied the central position.

To achieve a close packing of the chain inside the cell,
we used the following algorithm. First, a relaxed confor-
mation of the free chain was produced by the standard

FIG. 1: Upper part:

dimensional random chain-contour of length L = 400.2 (per-
sistence lengths) conﬁned inside a spherical cell of radius
R = 6. Lower part: Radial chain density distribution, av-
eraged over 20 conformations. Beyond r = 4 (dashed line),
the density declines rapidly.

Metropolis Monte-Carlo (MC) method. For the further
compression, we deﬁned the center-norm (c-norm) as the
maximum distance from the target (the middle point) to
the other parts of the chain. Then, the MC procedure
was continued with one modiﬁcation. Namely, a MC step
was rejected if the c-norm was exceeding 105% of the low-
est value registered so far. The procedure was stopped
when the desired degree of compaction was obtained.

Below in this paper, one step dt was chosen as the unit
of time and one persistence length lp = 50 nm of the
DNA chain as the unit of distance. The following values
of parameters were used. The length of one segment was
chosen as l0 = 0.2, so that one persistence length was
partitioned into 5 segments. The corresponding value of
the stiﬀness parameter was α = 2.403 [13]. The chain
radius was rc = 0.06, and the active site was modeled as
a sphere of identical radius ra = 0.06 embedded into the
chain. The step-size of the random walker both inside
and outside the chain was dr = 0.02, corresponding to a
diﬀusion coeﬃcient D3d = D1d = dr2/6 = 2 · 10−4/3.

Figure 1 displays a typical chain, and the radial chain
density, obtained with Monte Carlo integration and av-
eraged over 20 diﬀerent chain conformations. The strong
increase of chain density towards the center is merely a
geometric eﬀect and caused by the chain passing through
the origin. Close to the periphery of the cell, the den-

sity was rapidly declining since the contour was forced
to bend back inwards. Within a radius of r < 4, how-
ever, the chain content remained reasonably constant,
and the medium could be regarded as approximately ho-
mogeneous.

4. COMPUTATION OF THE SPECIFIC
RECURRENCE TIME

To compute the speciﬁc recurrence time ˜τR of Eq. (3),
the recurrence time inside a small test system (here: the
central binding target of radius Ra) has to be determined.
To achieve that, the entire system, i.e. the spherical tar-
get and a short piece of chain, was embedded into a cube
of 4Ra side-length with reﬂective walls. In principle, the
size of the cube should be of no relevance, but it was
found that, if chosen too small, eﬀects of the ﬁnite step-
size were emerging. The walker started inside the sphere.
Each time upon leaving the spherical volume a collision
was noted. If the walker was about to exit the cylindrical
volume of the chain, it was reﬂected back inside with the
probability 1 − p (Eq. 6). The clock was halted as long
as the walker moved outside the sphere and only counted
time-steps inside the sphere. The resulting recurrence
time τ ∗
R has to be divided by the eﬀective volume of the
central target, Eq. (9), to yield the speciﬁc recurrence
time ˜τR. Table I contains the results for a set of diﬀerent
walker-chain aﬃnities.

5. DIFFUSION INSIDE THE CELL

The goal is to analyze the propagation of the walker
within a small cell of radius RS and to extrapolate the
results to a larger system of arbitrary size RL > RS.
As a test site we have set up a cell of radius R = 6,
containing a chain of length L = 400.2 (Figure 1). The
walker was starting at the center (r = 0) and moving
towards the periphery of the cell. Such a process shall be
denoted as run. Whenever the walker returned back to
the binding site (r < Ra), one collision was noted. A set
of 2000 runs, including 20 diﬀerent chain conformations,
was carried out for each value of the exit parameter p,
which is related to the walker-chain aﬃnity via Eq. (6).
For a set of reaction coordinates ri, the ﬁrst arrival times
were monitored, as well as the number of collisions that
had occurred before ﬁrst passage.

5.1. The eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient

Figure 2 displays the ﬁrst arrival times (left) for diﬀer-
ent exit probabilities p. To analyse the diﬀusive proper-
ties of the propagation, the arrival times were ﬁtted using

(18) (right) within the range ξ < r < 4 and extrapolated to

with an eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient Deﬀ(p). For low and
moderate values of the walker-chain aﬃnity, the arrival
times were well described when assuming regular diﬀu-
sion, i.e. an exponent of α = 2. At high walker-chain
aﬃnities, this exponent was growing larger, indicating
the onset of anomalous subdiﬀusion. Table I contains
the ﬁt parameters when the ﬁts were carried out within
the range ξ < r < 4, and the solid curves in ﬁgure 2 (left)
display the resulting functional form of Eq. (17), when
extrapolated to the full range 0 < r < 6.

The lower boundary of the ﬁt range, the sliding length
ξ, was implemented because the near the central target,
the transport process was dominated by one dimensional
sliding rather than three dimensional diﬀusion. The up-
per boundary was introduced since the chain distribution
beyond r > 4 was aﬀected by boundary eﬀects near the
periphery of the cell, as is clearly visible at Figure 1.
Within the range of ξ < r < 4, however, the propaga-
tion of the walker could approximately be regarded as
a random walk inside a homogeneous and crowded envi-
ronment.

5.2. The functional dependence of Ncoll on the
target-distance

τf (p, r) =

rα
6Deﬀ(p)

(17)

The right hand side of Figure 2 displays the number
of collisions N coll as a function of the radius r for var-

t
ious walker-chain aﬃnities. Quite generally, there exists
a steep increase close to the central target, after which
the function gradually levels oﬀ to reach a plateau. In
Appendix A, we argue that this functional behavior can
be described as

Ncoll(r) =

N∞ · (r − Reﬀ )
r

,

(18)

where N∞ stands for the asymptotic limit Ncoll(r → ∞)
and Reﬀ deﬁnes an eﬀective target size. As a result of
facilitated diﬀusion, the mode of propagation is predom-
inantly one-dimensional near the central target. This
relation is therefore invalid within a radius of the aver-
age sliding length of the walker and should be applied for
r > ξ. Under this condition, both N∞ and Reﬀ were used
as free ﬁt-parameters and the ﬁt range was restricted to
ξ < r < 4, for the same reason as discussed in Sec. 5.1.
The solid curves of Figure 2 (right) display the best ﬁts
(extrapolated to r = 6), and Table I contains the corre-
sponding values for the ﬁt-parameters.

An alternative approach to Ncoll(r) is described in Ap-

pendix B, leading to

Ncoll(r) =

f (r)
Veﬀ ˜τR

,

(19)

where f (r) is deﬁned in Eq. (B2). It contains both pa-
rameters Deﬀ and Reﬀ which are used as free ﬁt param-
eters to determine the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient and
an eﬀective target size. The results are given in Table
I. The eﬀective volume Veﬀ (r) as a function of radius r
is actually a complicated function that depends on the
radial chain density (Fig. 1), but for this investigation

ability p = 2−l, the second column the corresponding sliding
parameter, followed by the speciﬁc recurrence time (Sect. 4).
The next six columns contain optimized parameters of the χ2-
ﬁts of equations (17), (18) and (19). The last column deﬁnes
the speed up achieved with the extrapolation from RS = 4 to

reaction time τBA(RL).

with the cell-radius R = 6. When comparing the best
ﬁts for the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient with the results
of Eq. (17), the agreement is only qualitative. In fact,
Eq. (20) does not deliver an accurate way to determine
Deﬀ. This may be so because the second term of function

the fraction R2
ﬁt-parameters Deﬀ and Reﬀ become linear dependent.
This implies that Deﬀ is actually determined locally, close
to the (eﬀective) target, and not averaged over ξ < r < 4.
Except for high walker-chain aﬃnities, Eq. (17) delivers a
more accurate description of the diﬀusion process, which
is veriﬁed with the quadratic dependence of the passage
time on the reaction coordinate.

The eﬀective target size Reﬀ agrees fairly well with the
corresponding ﬁndings of Eq. (18) and increases substan-
tially with the walker-chain aﬃnity. As a consequence
of facilitated diﬀusion, the walker initially moves away
from the target in one-dimensional sliding mode, and its
(eﬀectively) free diﬀusion begins further outside, thereby
increasing the eﬀective target size. Hence it is no surprise
to ﬁnd Reﬀ being of similar dimension as the average slid-
ing length ξ (Table I).

5.3. The empirical MEC-E equations

It is now possible to combine Equations (18) and (17)
with (1) and (2) to obtain the empirical MEC-E equa-
tions

τBA(p, r) = (Ncoll(p, r) + 1) ˜τR Veﬀ − τf (p, r) ,

(21)

τBA(RL)
τAB(RS )

which allow to evaluate the reaction time τBA(p, r) for
any reaction coordinate r by extrapolation of the number
of collisions Ncoll(p, r) and the ﬁrst arrival times τf (p, r).

When using Eq. (19) instead of (18), we obtain

which can be regarded as an empirical generalization of
Szabo’s exact result for free diﬀusion, Eq. (10).

Since both sets of equations are based on the MEC ap-
proach, while employing diﬀerent ways to extrapolate the
number of collisions to large cells, we will refer to them as
MEC-E equations. In the following section we will apply
both approaches, Eq. (21) and Eq. (22), to extrapolate
the reaction times to large cell radii, and compare their
results.

6. RESULTS

As a ﬁrst consistency-check, the MEC-E equations
were applied to estimate the reaction time τBA of the
walker entering the cell at radius R = 6. The simulation
of the reaction B → A was additionally carried out ex-
plicitly and the results are displayed in Figure 3. The ef-
fective volume of the cell was evaluated via Eq. (8), using
the total chain length L = 400.2. The results, shown in
Figure 3, imply that the extrapolation from RS = 4 (the
radius used to optimize the parameters) to RL = 6 deliv-
ered accurate results for the reaction times. This should
not be taken for granted, taking into account the prob-
lematic chain distribution between RS < r < RL. In fact,
τf (p, r) becomes inaccurate in this region due to anoma-
lous diﬀusion (Figure 2, left), but this term contributes
just a small amount to Eq. (21), since for reasonably large
cells the ﬁrst arrival time τf is small compared to the cor-
responding reaction time τBA. Its error was therefore of
little impact. On the other side, the collisions Ncoll(r)
with the central target, which form the main contribu-
tion to Eq. (21), were much less aﬀected by the chain
distribution far outside the center (Figure 2, right) and
were extrapolated accurately, despite of the sparse chain
density at the cell periphery. This feature contributes
to the fact that the extrapolation process appears to be
insensitive to the chain distribution far away from the
target. Similarly, Eq. (22) delivered consistent and accu-
rate results, except for the last data point which belongs

to the highest walker-chain aﬃnity. Here, the sliding-
length already reaches one half of the system size that
was used to ﬁt the empirical parameters. A larger di-
mensioned test system is required for such high aﬃnities
to increase the accuracy of the extrapolation procedure.

The simulation time required to set up the MEC-E
equations (21) and (22) equals the average number of
time steps the walker needed to reach the radius RS = 4
when starting at the central target, i.e. τf (p, RS). Com-
pared to the corresponding time required to simulate
τBA(RL) explicitly, a speed up between 50 and 500 was
gained, depending upon walker-chain aﬃnity (Table I,
last column). Integrated over all 12 data points, a total
speed up of 140 was derived.

It is possible and intended to exploit this method for
extrapolations to much larger systems. Figure 4 displays
the extrapolation of τBA(p, RL) up to RL = 20 for p = 1
(free diﬀusion) and p = 2−8, close to the minimum in
Figure 3. The chain density was assumed to remain con-
stant, i.e. its length was growing as L(RL) ∼ R3
L. Ex-
plicit simulations of τBA are not feasible any more for
such large cells. However, for free diﬀusion, Eq. (10) is
available, and both extrapolation methods delivered re-
action times about 8% above the exact solution, which, in
this plot, was un-distinguishable from the approximation
Eq. (15). When protein-chain interaction was enabled,
both extrapolation methods delivered almost identical
results, which were about 15% above the analytical esti-
mate Eq. (11).

APPENDIX A: PROOF OF EQUATION (18)

In this work, the empirical MEC-E equations (21) and
(22) were derived and tested against random walk sim-
ulations. Whereas the original MEC approach (Sect.
2.2) represents an exact method to obtain the average
reaction time τBA by simulating the much faster back-
reaction A → B, it still requires to set up a model sys-
tem of full size R. This would become prohibitive in
simulations of large cells containing realistic chains with
thermal ﬂuctuations and hydrodynamic interactions.

We have demonstrated that the simulation of a test
system of moderate size is suﬃcient to extract reaction
times of much larger cells. This is so because the number
of collisions as a function of the cell radius, Ncoll(r), is
asymptotically approaching a plateau (Figure 2, right).
In this region, the reaction time is merely proportional
to the eﬀective volume Veﬀ , as shown in Eq. (21), with a
small correction in form of the ﬁrst passage time τf (r),
Eq. (17). This quantity is easily estimated once the eﬀec-
tive diﬀusion coeﬃcient is determined. If the test system
is too small for Ncoll(r) to reach the plateau, it is still pos-
sible to obtain accurate results, because the functional
form of this quantity is known (Eq. 18 and 19), so that
extrapolations to larger cells become feasible.

The size of the test system has to be chosen with
care, because only those regions are of use in which the
walker experiences a randomized and approximately ho-
mogeneous environment. Within the central region, typ-
ically of the size of the sliding length ξ, the reaction
time is dominated by 1-dimensional (sliding) instead of
3-dimensional diﬀusion. This part of the cell has to
be excluded when the walker’s diﬀusion properties are
analyzed. The same holds true for the outermost re-
gion, where the chain conformation exhibits boundary
eﬀects. Assuming that the sliding length ξ does not ex-
ceed the persistence length lp, a cell radius R of ﬁve
persistence lengths appears adequate. Here, the region
ξ < r < R − 2 lp may be exploited to set up the empiri-
cal equations (21) or (22). With increasing walker-chain
aﬃnity and sliding length, the radius R has to be ad-
justed accordingly.

The results presented above demonstrate how the
MEC-E approach delivers a speed up between 50 and 500
(depending on walker-chain aﬃnity, Table I) by extrap-
olation from RS = 4 to RL = 6, with respect to explicit
simulations of the reaction time τBA. With increasing
radius RL, Eq. (22) is approximated as

τSz,eﬀ(RL ≫ Reﬀ ) ≈

and the speed up is therefore approximately growing pro-
portional to R3
L.

As was shown by Berg [14], the probability of a walker,
after starting at rini (where Ra < rini < R), to be ad-
sorbed at Ra, before reaching the distance R, is

P (R) =

Ra(R − rini)
rini(R − Ra)

.

(A1)

This was derived from the steady-state solution of Fick’s
second equation for spherical symmetry,

(A2)

Here, C(r) is the concentration, having a maximum at
the particle source radius r = rini and dropping to zero
at the adsorbers radii r = Ra and r = R.

In our case, not the probability P (r), but the average
number Ncoll(r) of events in which the walker returns to
r = Ra before ﬁrst reaching the distance r = R is of
interest. We shall now assume that Ncoll(r) is known for
one particular distance r, and we want to derive Ncoll(r +
dr). The probability, that the walker, starting from r,
goes straight to r+dr, is 1−dP (r). Then, the probability
to ﬁrst return back to the target, before passing through
r and reaching r + dr, is dP (1 − dP ). In this latter case,
2 ·Ncoll(r)+ 1 collisions have already occurred in average.
The probability to return exactly n times to the target
and back to r before reaching r + dr is dP n (1 − dP ),
yielding (n + 1) · Ncoll(r) + n collisions. The sum

Ncoll(r + dr) = (1 − dP )

Here, N∞ = Ncoll(r → ∞) is the asymptotic limit for the
number of collisions far away from the target. This so-
lution is incorrect close to the target, where Ncoll(Ra) =
−1. In fact, the validity of this approach is restricted to
length scales that are large compared to the (ﬁnite) step-
size. In particular, since we want extrapolate Ncoll(r) to

a large distance, we can assume r to be large enough so
that Ncoll(r) ≫ 1. Then, the sum Eq. (A3) simpliﬁes to

we note that in case of free diﬀusion the reaction time
τBA is given by Eq. (10) and τAB by Eq. (17) with the
free diﬀusion coeﬃcient D, Eq. (13), so that

Both parameters N∞ and Ra were used as free ﬁt param-

liver identical results when extrapolating to large radii, so
that, for sake of simplicity, Eq. (A9) was applied through-
out this work.

Abstract

The movement of Brownian particles on a ﬂuctuating two-state periodic potential is investigated.

In high transition rate, we use a expand method to get analytical results. It is found that the current

is a peaked function of thermal noise, barrier height and the ratio of the two transitions. These

phenomena are explained in detail. The thermal noise may be useful for directional motion at a

ﬁnite intensity. The asymmetry parameter of the potential is sensitive to the direction of the net

current.

1. INTRODUCTION

Much of the interest in non-equilibrium-induced transport processes is concentrated on

stochastically driven ratchets [1][2][3]. This subject was motivated by the challenge to ex-

plain unidirectional transport in biological systems, and several models have been proposed

to describe muscle contraction [4][5][6], or the asymmetric polymerization of action ﬁlaments

responsible of cell motility [7].

Rectiﬁcation of noise leading to unidirectional motion in ratchet systems has been an

active ﬁeld of research over the last decade. In these systems directed Brownian motion of

particles is induced by nonequilibrium noise in the absence of any net macroscopic forces

and potential gradients. Several physical models have been proposed: rocking ratchets

[8][9][10][11], fashing ratchets [12], diﬀusion ratchets [13], correlation ratchets [14], etc. In

all these studies the potential is taken to be asymmetric in space. It has also been shown

that one can obtain unidirectional current in the presence of spatially asymmetric potentials.

For these nonequilibrium systems external random force should be time asymmetric or the

presence of space dependent mobility is required.

In this paper, we mainly explore the current of the ﬂashing thermal ratchet in periodic

potentials without any external driven force. The organization of the paper is as follows: In

Sec. 2 we introduce the model and the basic quantities, namely, the average particle current

of the ratchet. In Sec. 3 we use a expand method to solve the two coupled Simoluchowsky

equations and the current is represented in detail. The summary and discussion of our

ﬁndings is presented in Sec. 4.

2. MODEL

We consider the movement of a Brownian particle subjected to a periodic potential, which

can be switched between two potential states as shown in Fig.1. This process called the

ﬂashing ratchet[15] is a paradigm for molecular motor. In state 2 the potential is constant,

and in state 1, it takes a regular ratchet shape. The rate of ﬂuctuation between the two

potential states is governed by the rate constants k1 and k2 where k1is the rate from state

1 to state 2 and k2 is the rate from state 2 to state 1. In state 2 the particle diﬀuses freely,

while in state 1 it is localized near a local minimum. While in either state, the motion of

2

particle is given simply by dimensionless equation

Where fB is Brownian random force. When the potential is ﬂuctuating between two states,

the probability densities pi(x, t)(i = 1, 2) can be describe the ratchet by two coupled Simolu-

chowsky equations:

In Fig. 2 we depict the noise-induced current J versus the thermal noise intensity kBT .

Worthy to point out from Fig. 2 is bell-shaped, resonance like feature of the probability

current J versus kBT . However, the critical value of current reversal is λc = 1.0 which

indicates that the potential V1(x) is symmetry. There no transitions out of the wells when

the thermal noise vanish (kBT → 0), then there is no current. On the other hand, if the

thermal noise is too large, it washes out the eﬀect of ratchet and the current again goes

to zero. The peaked function shows that the thermal noise is useful to induce net current.

Fig. 3 shows that the net current is a peaked function of barrier height V0. It is found

that the critical value of current reversal is also λc = 1.0. When the barrier height V0 is

small, the eﬀect of the ratchet will be ignored, only thermal noise takes eﬀect, so no net

current occur. On the other hand, if the barrier height value is too large and the particle

can not pass the barrier, the net current also goes to zero. As a result, there is a ﬁnite

optimized value V0 for the net current.

The Fig. 4 gives the relative between the net current J and the asymmetry parameter

λ. It is found that direction of the net current changes at λc = 1.0. When 0 < λ < 1 the

current value is positive, while current value is negative for 1 < λ < 2, and no current occur

at λ = 1. It is obvious that the asymmetry parameter is sensitive to the direction of the

current and no current are found for symmetry potential.

The Fig. 5 shows that the current is a peaked function of the ratio µ. µ is ratio k2 to k1.

When µ is very small (µ → 0), k2 → 0, the eﬀect of state 2 will be omitted and the particle

will always stay in state 1, so the ratchet become one state ratchet without external force

and no current occur in this case. similarly, if µ ≫ 1, the eﬀect of state 1 will be omitted,

the net current will go to zero, too. As a result, there is ﬁnite optimized value µ for the net

current.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In the paper, We imagine a particle driven by alternating its exposure to two potential

energy proﬁles: V1(x) and V2(x) which can be switched between two potential states as shown

in Fig.1. The V1 potential is a piecewise linear sawtooth potential, while V2(x) potential is

a constant.

We use a expand method to solve the two coupled simoluchowsky equations and analytical

results are represented. It is found that the current is a peaked function of thermal noise

intensity, barrier height and the ratio of the two stats transitions. We observe that the

current vanishes asymptotically, for large kBT , barrier height V0 and µ. It is obvious that

for large thermal noise intensity the inﬂuence of the ratchet potential becomes negligible, for

large V0 the particle can not pass the barrier and the two-states ratchet becomes a regular

ratchet with the potential V2(x) in case of large µ. On the other hand, for small thermal

noise the thermal ﬂuctuation can not make particles pass the barrier, if the barrier height

value is small the eﬀect of the ratchet potential can be negligible, and for large value µ the

two-states ratchet becomes a regular ratchet with the potential V1(x).

In a word, as for

thermal noise kBT , barrier height value V0 and the ratio µ, in cases of too large value or

too small values the current will go to zero. The asymmetry parameter λ determines the

direction of the movement and there is no current for symmetry potential. (λ = L/2)

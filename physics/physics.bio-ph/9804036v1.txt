Abstract

Quantum-mechanical analysis based on an exact sum rule is used to extract
an semiclassical angle-dependent energy function for transition metal ions in
biomolecules. The angular dependence is simple but diﬀerent from exist-
ing classical potentials. Comparison of predicted energies with a computer-
generated database shows that the semiclassical energy function is remarkably
accurate, and that its angular dependence is optimal.

Biomolecular modeling with classical potentials has become an increasingly important
tool in problems such as the determination of protein structure and function, and the design
of new molecules with desired properties. With the continuing availability of increasingly
powerful computers, one can only expect this growth to continue. A major roadblock toward
expanded use of modeling with classical potentials is the absence of suﬃciently reliable force
laws for transition metals in biomolecules. The ability to treat transition metals is impor-
tant because the active sites of many proteins are deﬁned by transition metals; also smaller
biologically active molecules often have transition metals as crucial constituents. In fact,
transition metal complexes have been proposed as crucial ingredients in the origin of life it-
self [1]. Unlike the s-p constituents of biomolecules, which usually have unique, well-deﬁned
bonding conﬁgurations (such as sp2 planar coordination), transition metals can adopt a
broad range of asymmetric environments. This asymmetry is often important for the func-
tioning of enzymes. Thus, for biomolecular modeling, one needs a “generic” potential which
treats essentially all physically reasonable environments instead of perturbations relative to
as single well-deﬁned structure. A priori, one does not know the functional form of such a
generic potential. The pair approximation, which ignores angular constraints, is applicable
to simple metal ions, but not to transition metals. The transition-metal d-orbitals lead
to complex angular forces which are manifested, for example, in the frequent occurrence
of Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions in square-planar environments that are unexpected on the basis of
pair interactions alone. In existing simulation codes based on classical potentials, the an-
gular terms are usually either ignored [2–4], on the assumption that direct ligand-ligand
interactions can take up most of the “slack”, or they are treated with simple assumed an-
gular forms. The latter range from quadratic or higher order expansions about observed
equilibrium bond angles [5–8] to more sophisticated expansions in trigonometric functions
[9–12]. However, there has been no derivation of the angular form of classical potentials
from quantum mechanics.

In this Letter, I use quantum-mechanical analysis to derive an energy function for d-
electrons based on the local environment in biomolecules. The energy function has a “semi-
classical” form, in the sense that it is slightly more complex than a classical additive sum of
ligand-ligand interactions, but is still straightforward to treat in molecular modeling codes.
To test the energy function, I generate a large number of random transition metal environ-
ments and evaluate their exact energies as a test set. The d-electron energy is described
with surprising precision. The accuracy is much better than that of commonly used func-
tional forms, and signiﬁcantly improves on that of additive energy functions. The angular
dependence of an energy function obtained by ﬁtting to the exact energies is very similar to
that derived analytically.

In biomolecules, transition metals are typically in a “coordination” bonding conﬁgura-
tion. This diﬀers from metallic bond in elemental transition metals in that the d-states
usually hybridize with ligand orbitals at lower energies, rather than other d-orbitals at the
same energy. This leads to well-deﬁned discrete charge states. The physics of coordination
bonding is well described by the ligand ﬁeld theory [16] (LFT), which treats the d-shell in
a transition-metal ligand complex by an eﬀective d-d Hamiltonian:

for simplicity, but the more general cases are treated straightforwardly.) This approximate
treatment describes the systematics of d-shell splittings in transition metal complexes quite
well, although the electronic transition energies are not obtained quantitatively. In the case
where only σ-type interactions between the ligands and the d-shell are present, the matrix
elements of the eﬀective Hamiltonian can be written [16] as

occupied and unoccupied states). As indicated in Fig. 1, splitting of the d-complex by
ligand-ﬁeld interactions provides a negative (stabilizing) contribution to ELFSE if the d-shell
is partly ﬁlled. The stabilizing contribution is enhanced if there is a gap between the highest
occupied and lowest unoccupied states, as occurs for Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions in the square-planar
coordination. We deﬁne the half-width W of the d-complex as the rms deviation of the energy
eigenvalues from the d-complex average energy ¯ε. In the ﬁrst approximation, one expects
that ELFSE should be proportional to W .

Because the square root of the ligand-ligand sum is taken, this type of energy function is

energy function, since the steps in its calculation are similar to those in the calculation of a
classical energy function, but quantum mechanical eﬀects are included in a systematic fash-
ion. It applies to one spin component of a transition metal d-shell; if both spin components
contribute, then ELFSE is simply the sum of contributions from the two components. The
form (7) is parallel in form to “many-atom” [13] and “embedded-atom” [14] energy func-
tions, but these are not angle-dependent. Modiﬁcations of the embedded atom method [15]
have included angular dependence, but without quantum-mechanical grounding, assuming
angular forms very diﬀerent from the present ones.

In order to evaluate the accuracy of this functional form in the types of disordered local
geometries that may be found in biomolecular environments, I have evaluated exact cluster
energies (from the eigenvalues of Eq. (1)) for an ensemble of transition-metal complexes
having random bond lengths and angles. The transition metal ions have six neighboring
ligands. The coupling strengths ei = e(ri) in Eqs. (3) and (7) vary randomly between 0
and 2 (in arbitrary units), corresponding to distances varying from a short-range cutoﬀ to
inﬁnity, and the orientations ˆri are chosen at random.
In this way, a very broad range
of environments, with eﬀectively varying coordination numbers, is sampled. Semiclassical
energy functions of the form (7), as well as classical energy functions, have been least-
squares ﬁtted to the exact d-electron energies of these clusters, for the ions Fe2+ through
Cu2+, taken in the high-spin conﬁguration (Mn2+ and Zn2+ are not included, since their
minority-spin d-bands are empty and ﬁlled respectively, so ELFSE vanishes). In the ﬁts, in
addition to the ligand-ligand interaction terms, we include a constant term in the ligand-
ligand interaction, as well as a sum of single-ligand terms. Figure 2a shows the ﬁt for Cu2+
obtained with the semiclassical energy function (7). The energies are ﬁt remarkably well,

Similar results are obtained for Ni. For Co2+, the fractional error is about 15 percent. For
Fe2+, the magnitude of ELFSE is found to be an order of magnitude smaller than for Cu2+
and Ni2+, and the fractional error resulting from using the potentials is about 50 percent;
nevertheless, the absolute errors are about half of those for Cu2+ and Ni2+. Figure 2b shows
corresponding results for a classical potential for Cu2+ of the form √ei√ej sin2 2θ, where the
angular dependence is taken from recent simulations of cluster energetics [12] and the √ei
dependence follows from dimensional analysis and the linear scaling of ELFSE with uniform

scaling the ei. We take this form to be typical of the treatment of transition metals in
standard modeling packages in which simple plausible forms are assumed. The ﬁt is much
less accurate, with a standard deviation of 0.49.

≤

The energy function (7-8) provides an optimal description of the d-shell energetics in
terms of two-ligand interaction interactions. To show this, I have ﬁtted more elaborate
potentials of the form (7) to the energy database, in which u(θ) is represented by a sum
of terms of the form cos nθ, with n
8. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The agreement
between the optimized u(θ) and the form (8) is almost exact for Cu2+ and Ni2+, and very
good for Co2+. For Fe2+, the absolute discrepancies are small, but the relative discrepancies
are larger. Note that the shapes of u(θ) as obtained here diﬀer completely from the sin2 2θ
form of Ref. [12], which is shown by the dotted curve in frame (a). In addition, I have tried
modiﬁed forms of Eq. (7), in which the square root is replaced by a power law dependence,
so that an exponent of unity gives an additive potential. The minimum error is obtained
with an exponent very close to 0.50, corresponding to the Eq. (7). Thus we have fairly
deﬁnitively pinned down the functional form of the angular forces around these ions. We
note that these results are also applicable to the low-spin versions of the ions, by simple
addition of contributions from the two subbands. Then, for example, low-spin Ni2+ becomes
equivalent to high-spin Cu2+.

The main chemical trend in u(θ) with changing d-count is a change in the magnitude
of the potential, rather than its shape. The potentials for Ni2+ and Cu2+ are similar in
magnitude, that for Co2+ roughly a factor of two weaker, and that for Fe2+ is weaker by
an order of magnitude. The weakness of the Fe2+ potential can be partly understood by
Hd, as given in Eq. (1), is
analysis of the energetics of four-ligand complexes. For these,
a sum of four one-dimensional projection operators thus has rank four. One readily shows
that all of its eigenvalues are nonnegative. This means that the lowest eigenvalue is zero,
independent of the angular arrangement of the ligands. In the case of Fe2+, there is only
one d-electron, which resides in the orbital having the zero eigenvalue. Thus there are no
angular interactions for Fe2+ with four ligands. For cases with higher coordination, the
lowest eigenvalue will still likely be close to zero unless the ﬁve contributing projection
operators are orthogonal to each other. From the point of view of practical application, the
variations seen in Fig. 3 suggest that the inclusion of angular forces for modeling Cu2+ and
Ni2+ is crucial, but that the Fe2+ ion (in high-spin conﬁguration) might well be modeled
with only radial interactions.

c

These features can be used to explain the observed chemical trends in the relative sta-
bility of square and tetrahedral structures in these systems.
I have evaluated the energy
diﬀerence ∆E between ELFSE between the square and tetrahedral coordination geometries.
Comparisons between the exact values and those obtained by Eq. (7) and the empirical
potential [12] are shown in Fig. 4, for the transition metal ions Fe2+ through Cu2+. The
empirical-potential results are much too small, but the basic trends of the exact results are
also seen in the semiclassical results, with the square structure favored strongly for Ni2+
and Cu2+. This trend is consistent with known structures of four-ligand transition metal
complexes. Such complexes of Ni2+ and Cu2+ overwhelmingly adopt square coordination,
in the absence of steric constraints, while Fe2+ and Co2+ generally have tetrahedral coor-
dination [17,18]. (We note that the experiments do not necessarily establish the sign of
the electronic contribution ∆E calculated here for a given system, since direct electrostatic

5

interactions between the ligands tend to favor tetrahedral coordination; only the trend with
varying d-count is established.) The structural energies can be understood with the help of
the potentials shown in Fig. 3. The minima at 0◦ and 180◦ favor the square structure in all
cases, but are weaker for Fe2+ and Co2+. In fact, the calculated values of ∆E correspond
fairly closely to the strengths of the angular interactions. The energy diﬀerences are not,
however, obtained quantitatively by the semiclassical energy function. The discrepancy lies
mainly in the energy of the tetrahedral structure. For tetrahedral Co2+, for example, the
semiclassical energy function underestimates

by about 20 percent.

ELFSE

In summary, I have shown that a new semiclassical angular energy function, with a simple
analytic angular dependence, describes the ligand-ﬁeld stabilization energy for transition-
metal ions in biomolecules remarkably well. The theoretical form for the angular dependence
is strongly conﬁrmed by analysis of a large computer-generated database of complexes.
Analysis of the angular form of the interactions justiﬁes the systematics of the relative
stability of square and tetrahedral packing in terms of the behavior of the interactions at 0◦
and 180◦. Incorporation of this form of energy function into existing biomolecular simulation
packages should signiﬁcantly enhance their reliability, and lead to new possibilities for design
of metal-containing biomolecules.

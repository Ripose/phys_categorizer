SYSTEMATICS OF THE GENETIC CODE AND ANTICODE:
HISTORY, SUPERSYMMETRY, DEGENERACY AND
PERIODICITY

The evolution of life is thought to have proceeded via an ‘RNA world’
with RNA as the functional and information storage medium. The original
role for peptides was to stabilise RNA enzymes (ribozymes) 1. The transla-
tion of nucleic acids into proteins occurs via tRNA adaptor molecules which
carry the amino acids for assembly. The tRNA’s get charged with their spe-
ciﬁc amino acid in interaction with an amino acyl-tRNA synthetase, which
recognises the tRNA anticodon and the appropriate amino acid (phylogenetic
studies 2 have suggested complementary relationships between the two classes
of tRNA synthetases, which use two diﬀerent amino acid attachment sites, and
similarly between the tRNA’s themselves). The dynamical basis of algebraic
approaches to the genetic code lies, in biochemical terms, in the complemen-
tary bonding properties of nucleoside bases in mRNA codons and in tRNA
anticodons, and also in the aﬃnities of tRNA species for particular amino
acids via conformational interaction between the sites of anticodon binding
and amino-acylation during charging.
If it is assumed that code evolution
represents an optimisation process, there is hope for an account in terms of
broken dynamical symmetries 3,4. In such schemes, it can be expected that cor-
relations between physico-chemical properties of anticodons and amino acids
should reﬂect their organisation under various subalgebra chains; furthermore,
the details of branching schemes at the level of individual weight vectors should
be consistent with accepted biological understandings of code history.

A recent model 5 based on 64-dimensional typical irreducible represen-
tations of the classical Lie superalgebra sl(6/1) fulﬁls these requirements in
that the branching diagram mimics the well-known tabular presentation of
the code. For example, the dominance of the middle base letter in deter-
mining anticodon hydrophilicity (with the −A− and −U − families showing
most divergence, and the −C/G− families intermediate) corresponds to a ﬁrst
branching stage wherein 64b → 1 × 16b + 2 × 16b+1 + 1 × 16b+2 with respect

to sl(2) + sl(4/1), with −A− and −U − as singlets, and magnetic splitting
between the −C− and −G− doublet only implemented at a later stageb. The
above points are also addressed in our model via Siemion’s studies 6 of the
periodicity of the genetic code. The analogue of atomic number for the genetic
code is organisation of codons into abstract ‘one step mutation rings’ where the
sequence of shifts 333-1-333-1-333-1-333-2-· · · is listed, with the ‘mutations’ on
the indicated base letter position being U → C → G → A repeated cyclically
or anticyclically after each higher level substitution. The three excursions into
diﬀerent second bases can be arranged so that the structure has the topology
of four interlocking rings, with C and G central, and A and U outlying, as in
the discussion of hydrophilicity (see ﬁgure 1). There is a solid body of evidence
that this arrangement exhibits periodicity in a host of experimental measures.
We end by demonstrating 5 how the ﬁgure can be regarded as a projection of
the weight diagram of the 64-dimensional codon irrep of sl(6/1).

Firstly, it is clear that the four ring pattern is convincingly similar to the
above branching rule for the 64 into hexadecuplets of sl(4/1), provided the
plot c is of ‘hypercharge’ Y ≡ J3
2 versus ∆(2). This same pattern re-
peats for each 16, with each ring being thought of as a small weight diagram
(1) vs ∆(1) superimposed on the Y vs ∆(2) plane, on which four fam-
of J3
ily boxes (quartets of sl(2/1)) are displayed. Finally, individual codons (and
amino acids) are located by a one-dimensional projection of these quartets with
(3). The orientations of each of these plots is determined
respect to ∆(3) + J3
by position on the rings, and the weights are arrayed as a diamond rather than
a circle. The result is shown in ﬁgure 2.

Siemion’s periodicity of the ring structure (as one example 6, with respect
to the Chou-Fasman amino acid Pβ conformational parameters, which give
statistical information on amino acid usages in protein β sheets) is expected to
be reproduced by dynamical symmetry operators which depend on the above
weight labels and associated Casimirs in a consistent way; work along these
lines is in progress. The vexed issue of code degeneracy in algebraic schemes
is, in our model 5, also related to the periodicity:
identical amino acids are
‘captured’ by tRNA’s working on equivalent positions with respect to reﬂec-
tion symmetries of the ring pattern 6 (the functional dependence of Casimir
operators must be chosen to respect such symmetries).
In the case of Ser,
it is obvious for example that the 1 1
2 family boxes responsible for its six-fold
degeneracy occur on the C and G rings at roughly the same relative location.

bThe subscript refers to the single nonzero (real number) Dynkin label of the 2n dimensional
typical irrep of sl(n/1)
cThe parameters ∆ represent the respective the Dynkin label shifts, and take values −1, 0, +
1; superscripts refer to base position within codons

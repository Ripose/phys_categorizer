Based on a cellular automaton model the growth kinetics and the critical surface dynamics of
cell monolayers is systematically studied by variation of the cell migration activity, the size of the
proliferation zone and the cell cycle time distribution over wide ranges. The model design avoids
lattice artifacts and ensures high performance. The monolayer expansion velocity derived from our
simulations can be interpreted as a generalization of the velocity relationship for a traveling front
in the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskounov (FKPP) equation that is frequently used to model
tumor growth phenomena by continuum models. The critical surface dynamics corresponds to the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class for all parameters and model variations studied. While
the velocity agrees quantitatively with experimental observations by Bru et al, the critical surface
dynamics is in contrast to their interpretation as generic molecular-beam-epitaxy-like growth.

Model simulations of tumor growth and therapy have
attracted wide interest [1]-[3]. An important issue to
which models can contribute is the classiﬁcation of the
tumor growth pattern by generic mechanisms at the level
of the individual cell actions (migration, division etc.).
These actions subsume the eﬀect of the molecular inter-
and intra-cellular regulation. The models can serve to
identify those cell activities that would result in a maxi-
mal inhibition of multi-cellular growth and invasion, and
thereby help to identify possible molecular drug targets.
Bru et al [4] analyzed the growth kinetics and critical
surface dynamics of many diﬀerent tumors in-vitro and
in-vivo. They quantiﬁed the dynamics of the tumor sur-
face by three critical exponents used to classify crystal
growth phenomena into universality classes [5]. They
found a generic linear growth phase of in-vitro growing
cell lines for large cell populations and a molecular-beam-
epitaxy (MBE)-like dynamics of the tumor surface both
in-vitro and in-vivo. They proposed a tumor therapy
based on these ﬁndings [6].
In this letter we analyze a class of cellular automaton
(CA) tumor growth models on an irregular lattice by ex-
tensive computer simulations. CA tumor growth models
enjoy wide interest [2] since they permit to represent each
cell individually at moderate computational expense. In
our model cells can divide, push neighbor cells and mi-
grate. The choice of the model rules is guided by com-
parison with an oﬀ-lattice model. By using the irregular
lattice we ensure isotropy and homogeneity of space, and
cell sizes that are sharply peaked around a prescribed
average value. Both the expansion speed and the spatial
pattern formed diﬀer from results on a periodic lattice.
We systematically analyze our growth model with respect

to the hopping rate, proliferation depth and dispersion of
the cell cycle time distribution and show that the expan-
sion dynamics can be mapped onto the functional form
of the traveling wave velocity of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-
Petrovskii-Piskounov (FKPP) equation [7]. The model
reproduces the monolayer expansion kinetics experimen-
tally found by Bru [4]. The critical surface growth dy-
namics suggests a Kadar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like [8] be-
havior over a wide range of parameters and for varying
cell migration mechanisms, supporting the critical com-
ment by Buceta and Galeano [9] on the conjecture by
Bru et. al. [4]. Our ﬁndings comply with the results in
the classical Eden model [10].
Our model is based upon the following assumptions:
[R1] Lattice generation: Starting from a regular square
lattice with spacing l, an irregular lattice ri is gener-
ated by Delauney triangulation. A biological cell is rep-
resented as shown in Fig.1(a) (white).
[R2] Exclusion principle: Each lattice site can be occu-
pied by at most one single cell.
[R3] Cycle time: The cell cycle time τ ′ is Erlang dis-
tributed (with a parameter m):

[R4] Proliferation depth: A cell can divide if and only if
there is at least one free neighbor site within a circle of
radius ∆L around the dividing cell (Fig. 1 (a), green).
[R5] Cell migration: We consider three alternative migra-
tion rules: R5(i) A cell moves with rate φ to a free neigh-
bor site, irrespectively of the number of neighbor cells
before and after its move. This rule corresponds to the
case of no cell-cell adhesion. R5(ii) Cells move with rate φ
if by this move the cell is not isolated. R5(iii) Cells move

and its distribution f (τ ′) controlled by the parameter m,

case of an energy-activated migration rule, the energy E.

Here we assume that the rate at which a cell changes its
state by a hop, a progress in the cell cycle, or a division
is independent of the number of accessible states as long
as at least one state, that is, one free adjacent lattice site
in case of a hop and one free site within a circle of radius
∆L in case of a division, is accessible. This may be justi-
ﬁed by noting that cells - in contrast to physical particles
- are able to sense their environment and therefore the
direction into which they can move.

To interpret the rules and parameters of the CA model
in terms of growth mechanisms we compare it with the
stochastic single-cell-based oﬀ-lattice growth model in
Ref.
In this model cell motion contains
an active random component and a component triggered
by mechanical forces between cells, and between cells and
the substrate [17]. During cell division the cell gradually
deforms and divides into two daughter cells as long as the
degree of deformation and compression is not too large.
As illustrated in Fig. 2 the lattice model is able to cap-
ture the behavior of the oﬀ-lattice model and agrees with
the experimental ﬁndings in Refs.
[4] provided the pa-
rameters ∆L, φ, τ , m are chosen properly. ∆L controls
the eﬀective thickness of the proliferative rim; in the oﬀ-
lattice model it depends on the mechanisms that control
the proliferation by contact inhibition, on the material
properties of the cell (the Young modulus, the Poisson
number etc.), and on the ability of a cells to move in re-
sponse to a mechanical stimulus [3].
At large m the tumor border becomes smoother and the
tumor shape reﬂects the symmetry of the underlying lat-

One point (black, green) is placed in every square of a square

points in space that are closer to the lattice point ri than to
any other rk. The shape of a biological cell (white) is iden-
tiﬁed with the corresponding Voronoi polygon (blue lines).

− O
This induces migration towards locations with a larger
number of neighbor cells.
By [R1] we generate an unstructured lattice with a sym-
metric cell area distribution sharply peaked around its
average A = l2 (see Fig.1 (a),(b)).
[R3] considers that
experiments indicate a Γ-like distribution of the cell cy-
cle controlled by cell cycle check points [12].
[R4] takes
into regard that the growth speed of tumors is usually
incompatible with the assumption that only cells at the
border are able to divide (as in the Eden model [13], see
[3]). Therefore we assume that a dividing cell is able to
trigger the migration of at most k neighbor cells into the
direction of minimum mechanical stress (see Fig.1 (a)).
If a cell divides, one of its daughter cells is placed at
the original position, the other cell is placed next to it
and the local cell conﬁguration is shifted and re-arranged
along the line that connects the dividing cell with the
closed free lattice site within a circle of radius ∆L such
that the latter is now occupied (see Fig.1 (a)). This al-
gorithm mimics a realistic re-arrangement process that
may occur from active cell migration as a response to a
mechanical stimulus, cf. Ref. [14]. Isolated cells perform
[15]). We consider dif-
a random-walk-like motion (e.g.
ferent migration rules R5(i)-(iii) to comprise a class of
potential models with biologically realistic behavior.

tesselation, in which such artifacts do not occur (Fig.

In conclusion we have analyzed the expansion ki-
netics and critical surface dynamics of two-dimensional
cell aggregates by extensive computer simulations within
a CA model which avoids artifacts from the symmetry

of regular lattices. The growth scenarios are compatible
with experimental observations. The asymptotic expan-
sion velocity has a form that is reminiscent of the front
velocity of the FKPP equation. The same expansion
velocity can be obtained for diﬀerent combinations of the
migration and division activities of the cell and of the
cycle time distribution. Recently, mathematical models
based on the FKPP equation were used to predict the
distribution of tumor cells for high-grade glioma in re-
gions which are below the detection threshold of medical
image techniques [24]. We believe such predictions must
fail since the FKPP equation lacks some important
parameters such as the proliferation depth which is
why it is not sensitive to relative contributions of the
proliferation depth and free migration. We observed in
our simulations that these relative contributions in fact
determine the cell density proﬁle at the tumor-medium
interface: the larger the fraction of free migration is, the
wider is the front proﬁle even if the average expansion
velocity is constant.
The critical surface dynamics found in our simulations
does not comply with the interpretation of experimental
observations by Bru et. al.
[4] even for the migration
mechanism they suggested (R5(iii)). We propose to
re-analyze the corresponding experiments and track the
paths of marked cells.

Simulations of a single membrane between two walls
using a Monte Carlo method

(February 2, 2008)

Quantitative theory of interbilayer interactions is essential to interpret x-ray scattering data and
to elucidate these interactions for biologically relevant systems. For this purpose Monte Carlo
simulations have been performed to obtain pressure P and positional ﬂuctuations σ. A new method,
called Fourier Monte-Carlo (FMC), that is based on a Fourier representation of the displacement
ﬁeld, is developed and its superiority over the standard method is demonstrated. The FMC method
is applied to simulating a single membrane between two hard walls, which models a stack of lipid
bilayer membranes with non-harmonic interactions. Finite size scaling is demonstrated and used
to obtain accurate values for P and σ in the limit of a large continuous membrane. The results
are compared with perturbation theory approximations, and numerical diﬀerences are found in the
non-harmonic case. Therefore, the FMC method, rather than the approximations, should be used
for establishing the connection between model potentials and observable quantities, as well as for
pure modeling purposes.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent research on lipid bilayers [1] has contributed
to the important biological physics goal of understand-
ing and quantifying the interactions between membranes
by providing high resolution x-ray scattering data. From
these data the magnitude of ﬂuctuations in the water
spacing between membranes in multilamellar stacks is
obtained. This enables extraction of the functional form
of the ﬂuctuational forces, originally proposed by Hel-
frich [2] for the case of hard conﬁnement. For systems
with large water spacings, the Helfrich theory has been
experimentally conﬁrmed [3]. For lecithin lipid bilayers,
however, the water spacing is limited to 20˚A or less. For
this important biological model system, our data show
that a theory of soft conﬁnement with a diﬀerent func-
tional form is necessary; this is not surprising because
interbilayer interactions consist of more than hard-wall,
i.e., steric interactions.

The theory of soft conﬁnement is even more diﬃcult
than the original Helfrich theory of hard conﬁnement.
Progress has been made by modeling the stack of inter-
acting ﬂexible membranes by just one ﬂexible membrane
between two rigid walls [4,5]. Even with this simpliﬁ-
cation, however, the theory involves an uncontrolled ap-
proximation using ﬁrst order perturbation theory and a
self-consistency condition in order that the interbilayer
interaction may be approximated by a harmonic poten-
tial [5]. We have obtained inconsistent results when ap-
plying this theory to our data (unpublished). Possible
reasons are (i) the theory is quantitatively inaccurate or
(ii) the single membrane model is too simple. The im-
mediate motivation for this paper is to test possibility
(i).

In order to obtain accurate results for a system with
realistic non-harmonic potentials, we use Monte-Carlo
(MC) simulations. The particular MC method developed

in this paper will be called the FMC method because it
uses the Fourier representation for the displacement of
the membrane rather than the customary pointwise rep-
resentation, which will be called the PMC method. The
main advantage of the FMC method is that the opti-
mal step sizes do not decrease as more and more ampli-
tudes are considered. In contrast, in PMC simulations,
the optimal step sizes decrease as the inverse of the den-
sity of points in one dimension, because the bending en-
ergy becomes large when single particle excursions make
the membrane rough. Because of this, relatively large
moves of the whole membrane are possible with the FMC
method, but not the PMC method. This produces rapid
sampling of the whole accessible phase space, while re-
specting the membrane’s smoothness. The resulting time
series have moderate auto-correlation times [6] that do
not increase substantially as the membrane gets larger
and/or more amplitudes are taken into account. Even
though each Monte Carlo step takes longer, FMC still
outperforms PMC by a wide margin. It then becomes
possible to carry out substantial simulations on a stan-
dalone workstation rather than a supercomputer [7] and
to obtain accurate results for a single membrane subject
to realistic potentials with walls, and even for a stack of
such membranes (to be described in a future paper) [8].
Section II deﬁnes the membrane model and the phys-
ical quantities simulated in the paper. Section III de-
scribes the FMC method and also gives some important
details that are used to speed up the code. In Section
IV the method is tested on an exactly solvable model,
namely, one that has only harmonic interactions with
the walls. This test also allows examination of the sys-
tem properties and the convergence of FMC results for
an inﬁnitely large, continuous membrane. In section V
the FMC method is applied to a single membrane with
realistic, non-harmonic interactions with the walls. Sec-
tion VI makes a detailed comparison of the FMC method

1

and the standard PMC method. This section shows that
the FMC method not only converges faster to average
values for continuous membranes, but also gives smaller
stochastic errors. Finally, section VII compares simula-
tion results with those obtained using the analytic ﬁrst-
order theory of Podgornik and Parsegian [5] and from
experiment [1].

tween two hard walls.

At the atomic scale a lipid membrane is composed of
complex lipid molecules and many simulations are per-
formed at this scale [9–11]. However, for modeling the
structure factor for low angle x-ray scattering (in con-
trast to modeling the form factor), it is customary and
appropriate [12–15] to model the membrane as an in-
ﬁnitely thin ﬂexible sheet as shown in Fig.1.

The membrane undulates with instantaneous ﬂuctua-
tions in the z-direction, given by u(x, y), subject to pe-
riodic boundary conditions. The model energy W is a
sum of bending energy with a bending modulus Kc and
an energy of interaction with the walls,

W =

(∆u)2dx dy +

wa(u)dx dy.

Since each wall is a surrogate for a neighboring membrane
in a stack, and since it is desired to obtain physical prop-
erties per membrane, the interaction potential is given by
the average wa(u) = (V (a + u) + V (a
u))/2 of the inter-
actions V with each wall and the corresponding volume
of the system per membrane is then aL2. For a separa-
tion z between a wall and the membrane the interaction
potential will be based on the standard form

where the ﬁrst term on the right hand side is a repulsive
hydration potential [5] and the last term is an approxi-
mate, attractive van der Waals potential. The divergence

→

in the van der Waals potential as z
0 in Eq.(2) is quite
artiﬁcial; physically, it is masked by stronger steric repul-
sions at small z [16]. This is corrected in this paper by
including only a ﬁnite number of terms mmax in a power
series expansion of 1/z2 about u = 0. It is shown later
that a wide range of mmax give nearly the same result, so
mmax is not a critical parameter and power series suﬃce
to represent the van der Waals potential satisfactorily for
the most probable values of z but avoid including artiﬁ-
cial traps near the walls. Other forms besides Eq.(2) can
be treated as well.

The ﬁrst important quantity, obtained directly from
the simulation, is the mean square ﬂuctuation σ2 in the
water spacing. In Fig.1, σ2 = u2(x, y), where the average
is over both space and time. The second physical quan-
tity is the pressure P that must be exerted on the walls
to maintain the average water spacing a. The pressure is
a sum of two components: P1, caused by collisions and
equal to a temporal average of a delta-function-like in-
stantaneous pressure, and P2, which is due to non-contact
interactions with the walls, and that varies smoothly with
time and position. A virial theorem argument can be
used to compute P1. The general result is

where P1 is the term in square brackets. The relative im-
portance of P1 and P2 depends on the potential. If the
potential is completely steric (hard wall), then P2 = 0.
However, we have found that for the more realistic poten-
tials considered in this paper P1 is very small compared
to P2 because there are very few hard collisions.

Using the standard Metropolis algorithm, the simu-

randomly, at a time. The initial step sizes, which de-
pend upon ~Q, are determined using a simpliﬁed form
of the analytic theory [5]. After a certain number of
Monte Carlo steps (MCS), step sizes are adjusted using
Dynamically Optimized Monte-Carlo(DOMC) [17]. Step
size optimization results in an acceptance-rejection ra-
tio of about 1/2, thereby minimizing the autocorrelation

The second usage of Eqs. (6) and (7) is to obtain σ
and P as functions of N and L through the ﬁnite sums
over ~Q. Simulations are always done with a ﬁnite num-
ber of Fourier amplitudes and a ﬁnite-sized membrane.
However, real membranes are continuous and the rele-
vant size may be larger than 1µm. So it is important
to see how the results for ﬁnite systems can be used to

V. OBTAINING RESULTS FOR REALISTIC
INTERACTION POTENTIALS

Table I shows results for two selected non-harmonic
potentials and a variety of sizes. One may ﬁrst note that
the autocorrelation times τσ2 and τP are nearly constant
with system size. Next, convergence with increasing N
and constant L is shown in Fig.2 when the vdW interac-
tion is absent. This behavior is similar to that of a har-
monic interaction. The limiting values can be estimated
by ﬁtting the curve y = y∞ + C2/N 2 + C3/N 3. The ﬁts,

shown as solid lines on Fig.2, lead to σ∞ = 4.394

based on a reasonably good approximation, DOMC ad-
justment does not signiﬁcantly improve the eﬃciency.

The change in bending energy in Eq.(1) after attempt-
ing a step in u( ~Q) is KcL2Q4/2 times the change in
2, which requires little time to compute. In contrast,
u( ~Q
|
|
calculating the change in the interaction energy with the
walls requires a real space representation of u(x, y). How-
ever, it is not necessary to use a fast Fourier transform
(FFT) routine because the linearity of the Fourier trans-
form requires only recomputing one Fourier term in order
to update u(x, y). The time this takes is only O(N 2) com-
pared to O(N 2 ln N ) for a standard FFT routine. Incre-
mental addition errors are negligible for the longest runs
when double precision is used; alternatively, one could
perform FFT at long intervals to control such an error.
The natural choice is made to approximate the interac-
tion integral over the membrane by a sum over a set of
equally spaced points (Li/N, Lj/N ), with 0

i, j < N .

IV. HARMONIC INTERACTIONS AND
FINITE-SIZE SCALING

To test the simulation code and investigate conver-
gence to an inﬁnite, continuous membrane, it is useful
to consider a harmonic interaction energy. It is also use-
ful to relate the parameters in the harmonic potential
to those in Eq.(1) by expanding wa(u) to second order
about u = 0,

Unfortunately, one does not obtain the same asymp-
totic behavior as in Fig.2 when the attractive force is
large enough that the total potential has a maximum
rather than a minimum when in the middle of the space
between the walls. For instance, when H
=0, σ ﬁrst de-
creases with N , although later it gradually levels oﬀ and
appears to have a minimum. It is interesting that, while
σ may change in an unexpected way as N increases, for
the interaction considered, the pressure is still a smooth
quasi-linear function of 1/N 2 (N
), as shown in Fig.
can still be estimated
3, and its limiting value as N
by extrapolation. Despite these variations in convergence
behavior, the associated changes in σ become very small
and are certainly less than the desired accuracy of 1-2%,
so we suggest that it is suﬃcient to increase N only to
the point where further increases result in changes in σ
and P that are less than the target precision.

The other variable that is potentially signiﬁcant is the
size of the membrane. Any physical quantity may depend
on how large the membrane is, attaining a certain lim-
iting value as L
. By increasing L while keeping the
“density” N/L = const, the membrane size is determined
for which σ and P approach their limiting values suﬃ-
ciently closely. As in the case of harmonic interaction,
the changes in these quantities are relatively small as L
is increased. Indeed, when there is no attractive force,
the changes are so small that they cannot be resolved
reliably even when the estimated statistical errors are of
10−3˚A. When the interaction is smaller, the
order of 3
·
trends become more pronounced and similar to those seen
for the harmonic potential. An example is given in Fig.4
which shows that for a moderate sized membrane the re-
sults approach smoothly and closely those for an inﬁnite
). For L = 700˚A the diﬀerence between
membrane(L
the estimated limiting value of σ and the observed one at
700˚A is less than 0.5%, while for the pressure the same
diﬀerence is less than 5% which is about the same as the
experimental uncertainty in P .

In summary, of the two factors that could aﬀect con-

important. L is therefore ﬁxed, typically at 700˚A. N is
increased until the changes in quantities of interest are
less than the target precision. We then ﬁt a simple func-

B. Comparison of the FMC and PMC methods

The time required to obtain a target error is one of the
issues determining the viability of any simulation tech-
nique. It is impacted by two separate factors: the rela-
tive magnitude of random errors, and the speed at which
various quantities, obtained for a ﬁnite system, converge
to their values for the continuous inﬁnite system. These
factors are now considered in detail, to demonstrate the
improvements of the FMC method.

M CS0.1%, required for 0.1% precision of σ, for a PMC sim-
ulation of a harmonic potential with A = 1, H = 0, Kc = 1,
λ = 1.8˚A, a = 20˚A, T = 323K and L = 700˚A and for an
FMC simulation for a realistic model potential with the same
parameters.

The random errors in estimated averages depend on
the autocorrelation times of generated time series. These
times are an indication of how “natural” the chosen ba-
sis is for the simulated system. In the case of harmonic
interactions, the variables used by FMC are exactly inde-
pendent and therefore it is possible to vary each of them
separately over its whole range. Although they do be-
come correlated for realistic interactions, one would still
hope that their dependencies are not great, and so they
still represent a good basis. For PMC simulations, how-
ever, the motion of any point is constrained by its envi-
ronment, so one would expect the quality of time series to
deteriorate as the “density” of the membrane and the im-
portance of the local environment increase. These asser-
tions are supported by Tables I and II, which show that
for FMC the autocorrelation times remain roughly con-
stant with increasing N , whereas for PMC τσ increases as
N 4. A related question is how the simulation length (in
MCS) required to obtain a certain accuracy (chosen to be
0.1%) varies with N. A straight line ﬁt to ln(M CS0.1%)
vs.
ln N dependence for PMC has a slope of approxi-
mately 4 (Fig.5). Therefore, the amount of time required
to obtain σ with the same precision grows as N 6 for PMC
method. A somewhat surprising result is that the length
required to achieve a given error estimate with FMC de-
creases with N (Fig.5). The precise law governing this
decrease is unclear because of the diﬃculty of estimat-

ing autocorrelation times; one guess, supported by the
four points in the middle (N = 8 through 24) is that
the length decreases as 1/√N ; however, the hypothesis
of the length staying asymptotically constant cannot be
ruled out either. Because 1 MCS (for FMC) takes the
amount of time O(N 4), the computational complexity of
the process generated by a Fourier-space simulation is
only N 3.5 or N 4, assuming that the same error estimate
is achieved. This is a signiﬁcant improvement over the
N 6 law for the real-space simulations.

The second factor favoring FMC concerns how closely
the bending energy is approximated by the discrete ap-
proximation in Eq.(10). This can be evaluated by the
exact result for σ for a harmonic model. Fig.6 shows
that one requires larger N to obtain the same precision
with the discrete approximation to the bending energy
required by the PMC method in Eq.(10) than for the
true continuum model that can be treated naturally by
the FMC method.

A speciﬁc example illustrates the preceding principles
and also gives some typical computer times for these sim-
ulations. The example is the harmonic model with pa-
rameters given in Fig.6. For the PMC simulation, N = 46
was chosen so that σexact(46, L = 700˚A) = 7.7898 was
within 0.5% of its value 7.7478˚A for a continuous mem-
brane. A simulation of 800,000 MCS took 9.5 hours on an
SGI workstation with MIPS R5000 1.0 CPU and 128 Mb

of RAM, running IRIX 6.2 and resulted in σ = 7.33
So, 9.5 hours were insuﬃcient to obtain σ with 0.5%
accuracy, and about 9.5
229 hours
would be required to achieve that precision. Turning
to FMC, for N = 16 the exact σ = 7.7111˚A. A run
of 10,000 MCS yielded σ = 7.7184
0.0165 and required
only 240 seconds on the same computer as the PMC sim-
ulation. One may also compare the time it takes to ob-
tain the same estimates of random errors for the same N
for the two methods. To do this, N = 16 and a target
error of about 1% were chosen for the same interaction
as before. A PMC simulation for 300000 MCS took 1174

faster convergence of the expected value to one for a con-
tinuous membrane, the FMC method is also the faster
one to obtain a given estimate of stochastic errors.

VII. RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS

A. Distribution of the membrane displacements

The functional form of the probability density function
(pdf) is a central assumption in the perturbation theory
[5]. Also, the behavior of the pdf near the walls is sig-
niﬁcant in discussing the formal divergence of the van
der Waals potential and the importance of the hard wall
collision pressure P1. If the pdf does not decay to zero
suﬃciently quickly near the walls, then the value of mmax
used in the power series expansion would be a sensitive
parameter and one would expect many hard collisions
with the walls. The inset to Fig.7 shows that the pdf de-
cays to zero near the walls in much the way that is pos-
tulated by theory [5]. This is consistent with our results
that P1 is small and mmax is an insensitive parameter.
This latter point is explicitly illustrated in Fig.8 which
shows that the results for σ plateau for 6 < mmax < 40;
a similar plateau occurs for P . Finally, Fig.7 shows that,
away from the walls, the pdf is noticeably diﬀerent from
the theoretically assumed pdf [5] and it is generally dif-
ferent from a Gaussian.

A = 1, H = 4, λ = 1.8, Kc = 0.2 and also for H=0 (all other
parameters being the same) and corresponding results from
the perturbation theory [5].

For any kind of interaction, the main results to com-
pare to experiment are the relationships between ln P
and a, and σ and a. Figure 9 shows ln P and σ for sev-
eral values of a. Two interaction types are considered:
A = 1, H = 4, λ = 1.8, Kc = 0.2 and the same set with

8

H = 0. These ﬁgures also show the results obtained from
the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory [5]. The largest diﬀer-
ences with the simulations occur at larger a and when H
is non-zero. In particular, the theory under-predicts the
value of a at P = 0 when no osmotic pressure is applied.
Overall, however, the theory predicts trends quite well.

C. Comparison to Experiment

Recently, it has been proposed that the pressure due to
ﬂuctuations, Pf l, can be obtained from x-ray line shape
data [1]. The derivation involves the use of harmonic
Caille theory [12,15], which yields

Pf l =

where σ is obtained from

σ2 = η1D2/π2,

(13)

(14)

−

where η1 is the Caille parameter determined by the line
shape. The experimental data for three diﬀerent lipids
indicated that Pf l could be represented by an exponen-
tial exp(
a/λf l), in agreement with the result of pertur-
bation theory [5], but that λf l was signiﬁcantly greater
than 2λ instead of exactly 2λ given by perturbation the-
ory. Since neither the perturbation theory nor the har-
monic interpretation of the data are necessarily correct,
it is valuable to test these predictions using simulations.
Figure 10 shows two ways of obtaining Pf l from the

simulations. The ﬁrst way uses the deﬁnition

P = Pf l + Pb,

(15)

where P is the total osmotic pressure and Pb is the pres-
sure with no ﬂuctuations, i.e.
for the membrane ex-
actly in the middle of the space between the two walls
with u(x, y) = 0. The second way uses Eq.(13). Fig.10
shows that the simulated Pf l can be reasonably repre-
sented by an exponential using either method of compu-
tation, thereby supporting both theory and experiment.
Either method gives decay lengths λf l that exceed 2λ,
thereby supporting experiment. The two results for Pf l
in Fig.10 do not, however, agree perfectly, and the dis-
crepancy grows for larger values of a. This is not sur-
prising because the harmonic approximation is better for
small a and progressively breaks down, especially when
the bare potential no longer has a minimum at z = 0.
This discrepancy suggests that one should expect some
error when subtracting Pf l obtained from Eq.(13) from
P in Eq.(15) to obtain Pb, although the error is encour-
agingly small. Nevertheless, future work in this direction
can employ simulations to correct this discrepancy and
to allow a better estimate of Pb from which Ph, λ and H
are obtained [1].

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

This paper solves accurately a model of constrained
single membrane ﬂuctuations. The new FMC simulation
method provides a way to simulate accurately, with mod-
est computer resources, the pressure and mean square
ﬂuctuation of a simple membrane between two hard walls
with realistic potentials. This method is clearly superior
to the more conventional PMC simulation method. Used
with typical values of interaction parameters, it supports
the idea of the exponential decay of ﬂuctuational pres-
sure, lending credibility to a simpliﬁed interpretation of
X-ray scattering data in [1]. Finally, the method, with
minor modiﬁcation, may be applied to studies of more
complicated models, such as a stack of membranes or
models of charged lipids and more sophisticated data
analysis.

[6] The duration of a simulation is measured in Monte-Carlo
steps (MCS). 1 MCS is deﬁned as such a sequence of
“moves” that, on average, changes the variable corre-
sponding to each degree of freedom once. One MCS is
equivalent to N 2 changes of randomly chosen amplitudes
for FMC simulations and for PMC simulations it is equiv-
alent to N 2 moves of randomly chosen points. The auto-
correlation times [19], denoted τ with subscripts referring
to physical quantities are also measured in MCS.

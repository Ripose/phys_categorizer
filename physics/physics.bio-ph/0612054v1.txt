In eukaryotic cells, many motor proteins can move simultaneously on a single microtubule track.
This leads to interesting collective phenomena like jamming. Recently we reported (Phys. Rev. Lett.
95, 118101 (2005)) a lattice-gas model which describes traﬃc of unconventional (single-headed)
kinesins KIF1A. Here we generalize this model, introducing a novel interaction parameter c, to
account for an interesting mechano-chemical process which has not been considered in any earlier
model. We have been able to extract all the parameters of the model, except c, from experimentally
measured quantities. In contrast to earlier models of intra-cellular molecular motor traﬃc, our model
assigns distinct “chemical” (or, conformational) states to each kinesin to account for the hydrolysis
of ATP, the chemical fuel of the motor. Our model makes experimentally testable theoretical
predictions. We determine the phase diagram of the model in planes spanned by experimentally
controllable parameters, namely, the concentrations of kinesins and ATP. Furthermore, the phase-
separated regime is studied in some detail using analytical methods and simulations to determine
e.g. the position of shocks. Comparison of our theoretical predictions with experimental results is
expected to elucidate the nature of the mechano-chemical process captured by the parameter c.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Motor proteins are responsible for intra-cellular trans-
port of wide varieties of cargo from one location to an-
other in eukaryotic cells [1, 2, 3]. One crucial feature of
these motors is that these move on ﬁlamentary tracks [4].
Microtubules and ﬁlamentary actin are protein ﬁlaments
which form part of a dual-purpose scaﬀolding called cy-
toskeleton [5]; these ﬁlamentary proteins act like struts
or girders for the cellular architecture and, at the same
time, also serve as tracks for the intra-cellular transporta-
tion networks. Kinesins and dyneins are two superfami-
lies of motors that move on microtubule whereas myosins
move on actin ﬁlaments. A common feature of all these
molecular motors is that these perform mechanical work
by converting some other form of input energy. How-
ever, there are several crucial diﬀerences between these
molecular motors and their macroscopic counterparts;
the major diﬀerences arise from their negligibly small
inertia. That’s why the mechanisms of single molecu-
lar motors [1, 2, 3] and the details of the underlying
mechano-chemistry [6] have been investigated extensively
over the last two decades.

However, often a single ﬁlamentary track is used simul-
taneously by many motors and, in such circumstances,
the inter-motor interactions cannot be ignored. Funda-
mental understanding of these collective physical phe-
nomena may also expose the causes of motor-related dis-
eases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) [7] thereby helping, pos-
sibly, also in their control and cure.

To our knowledge, the ﬁrst attempt to understand ef-

fects of steric interactions of motors was made in the con-
text of ribosome traﬃc on a single mRNA strand [8]. This
led to the model which is now generally referred to as the
totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP);
this is one of the simplest models of non-equilibrium sys-
In the
tems of interacting driven particles [9, 10, 11].
TASEP a particle can hop forward to the next lattice
site, with a probability q per time step, if and only if the
target site is empty; updating is done throughout either
in parallel or in the random-sequential manner.

Some of the most recent generic theoretical models of
interacting cytoskeletal molecular motors [12, 13, 14, 15]
are appropriate extensions of TASEP. In those models
the motor is represented by a self-driven particle and the
dynamics of the model is essentially an extension of that
of the TASEP [9, 11] that includes Langmuir-like kinetics
of attachment and detachment of the motors. Two diﬀer-
ent approaches have been suggested. In the approach fol-
lowed by Parmeggiani, Franosch and Frey (PFF model)
[13, 16], attachment and detachment of the motors is
modelled, eﬀectively, as particle creation and annihila-
tion, respectively, on the track; the diﬀusive motion of
the motors in the surrounding ﬂuid medium is not de-
scribed explicitly. In contrast, in the alternative formu-
lation suggested by Lipowsky and co-workers [12, 17], the
diﬀusion of motors in the cell is also modelled explicitly.

In reality, a motor protein is not a mere particle, but
an enzyme whose mechanical movement is coupled with
its biochemical cycle. In a recent letter [18] we consid-
ered speciﬁcally the single-headed kinesin motor, KIF1A
[19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The movement of a single KIF1A

motor had already been modelled earlier [20, 24] by a
Brownian ratchet mechanism [25, 26].
In contrast to
the earlier models [12, 13, 14, 15] of molecular motor
traﬃc, which take into account only the mutual inter-
actions of the motors, our model explicitly incorporates
also this Brownian ratchet mechanism of the individual
KIF1A motors, including its biochemical cycle that in-
volves adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis.

The TASEP-like models predict the occurrence of
shocks. But since most of the bio-chemistry is captured
in these models through a single eﬀective hopping rate, it
is diﬃcult to make direct quantitative comparison with
experimental data which depend on such chemical pro-
cesses. In contrast, the model we proposed in ref. [18]
incorporates the essential steps in the biochemical pro-
cesses of KIF1A as well as their mutual interactions and
involves parameters that have one-to-one correspondence
with experimentally controllable quantities.

Here, we present not only more details of our earlier
calculations but also many new results on the properties
of single KIF1A motors as well as their collective spatio-
temporal organization. Moreover, here we also general-
ize our model to account for a novel mechano-chemical
process which has not received any attention so far in
the literature. More speciﬁcally, two extreme limits of
this generalized version of the model correspond to two
diﬀerent plausible scenarios of ADP release by the motor
enzymes. To our knowledge [27], at present, it is not pos-
sible to rule out either of these two scenarios on the basis
of the available empirical data. However, our new gen-
eralized model helps in prescribing clear quantitative in-
dicators of these two mutually exclusive scenarios; use of
these indicators in future experiments may help in iden-
tifying the true scenario.

An important feature of the collective spatio-temporal
organization of motors is the occurance of a shock or
domain wall, which is essentially the interface between
the low-density and high-density regions. We focus on
the dependence of the position of the domain wall on
the experimentally controllable parameters of the model.
Moreover, we make comparisons between our model in
the low-density regime with some earlier models of single
motors. We also compare and contrast the basic features
of the collective organization in our model with those
observed in the earlier generic models of molecular motor
traﬃc.

II. DISCRETIZED BROWNIAN RATCHET
MODEL FOR KIF1A: GENERAL FORMULATION

Through a series of in-vitro experiments, Okada, Hi-
rokawa and co-workers established [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]
that:

i. KIF1A molecule is an enzyme (catalyst) and
in each enzymatic cycle it hydrolyzes one ATP
molecule; the products of hydrolysis being adeno-
sine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate.

FIG. 1: A biochemical cycle of a KIF1A motor (upper) and
a three-valued discrete model for traﬃc of interacting KIF1A
motors on a ﬁnite microtubule ﬁlament (lower). The states
left to the dotted line in the upper ﬁgure correspond to
strongly bound to microtubule states (state 1) while those
right are weakly bound (state 2). 0 denotes an empty site,
and only 2 can move either to the forward or backward site.
Transition from 1 to 2 occurs at the same site which corre-
sponds hydrolysis, and the detachment also happens in this
process. The attachment is possible only at the empty sites.
At the minus and plus ends the probabilities are diﬀerent from
those at sites in the bulk.

Thus, each biochemical cycle of a KIF1A motor
consists of four states: bare kinesin (K), kinesin
bound with ATP (KT), kinesin bound with ADP
and phosphate (KDP) and, ﬁnally, kinesin bound
with only ADP (KD) after releasing phosphate
(Fig. 1).

ii. When a single-headed kinesin binds with a ATP
molecule, its binding with its microtubule track is
weakened by the ATP hydrolysis. Both K and KT
bind strongly to microtubules. Hydrolysis of ATP
leads to the state KDP which has a very short life-
time and soon yields KD by releasing phosphate.
KD binds weakly to a microtubule. After releasing
all the products of hydrolysis (i.e., ADP and phos-
phate), the motor again binds strongly with the
nearest binding site on the microtubule and thereby
returns to the state K.

iii. In the state KD, the motor remains tethered to the
microtubule ﬁlament by the electrostatic attraction
between the positively charged K-loop of the mo-
tor and the negatively charged E-hook of the mi-
crotubule ﬁlament. Because of this tethering in the
weakly bound state, a KIF1A cannot wander far
away from the microtubule, but can execute (essen-
tially one-dimensional) diﬀusive motion parallel to
the microtubule ﬁlament. However, in the strongly
bound state, the KIF1A motor cannot execute dif-
fusive excursions away from the binding site on the
microtubule.

These experimental results for the biochemical cycle
of KIF1A motors indicate that a simpliﬁed description

in terms of a 2-state model could be suﬃcient to un-
derstand the collective transport properties. As shown
in Fig. 1 one distinguishes a state where the motor is
strongly bound to the microtubule (state 1) and a state
where it is weakly bound (state 2).

As in the TASEP-type approach of the PFF model,
the periodic array of the binding sites for KIF1A on
the microtubule are represented as a one-dimensional
lattice of sites that are labelled by the integer index i
(i = 1, ..., L). KIF1A motors are represented by particles
that can be in two diﬀerent states 1 and 2, corresponding
to the strongly-bound and weakly bound states. To
account for the empirical observations, the model also
contains elements of a Brownian ratchet. As in the
PFF model, attachment and detachment of a motor are
modelled as, eﬀectively, creation and annihilation of the
particles on the lattice. We use the random sequential
update, and the dynamics of the system is given by the
following rules of time evolution:

(1) Bulk dynamics
If the chosen site on the microtubule is empty, i.e., in
state 0, then with probability ωadt a motor binds with
the site causing a transition of the state of the binding
site from 0 to 1. However, if the binding site is in state
1, then it becomes 2 with the probability ωhdt due to
hydrolysis, or becomes 0 with probability ωddt due to
the detachment from the microtubule during hydrolysis.
If the chosen site is in state 2, then the motor bound
to this site steps forward to the next binding site in front
by a ratchet mechanism with the rate ωf or stays at the
current location with the rate ωs. Both processes are
triggered by the release of ADP. How should one modify
these update rules if the next binding site in front is
already occupied by another motor? Does the release of
ADP from the motor, and its subsequent re-binding with
the ﬁlamentary track, depend on the state of occupation
of the next binding site in front of it? To our knowledge,
experimental data available at present in the literature
are inadequate to answer this question. Nevertheless, we
can think of the two following plausible scenarios: in the
, the following kinesin, which
cases
is in state 2, can return to state 1, only at its current
location, with rate ωs if ADP release is regulated by the
motor at the next site in front of it. But, if ADP release
by the kinesin is independent of the occupation status of
the front site, then state 2 can return to state 1 at the
ﬁxed rate ωs +ωf , irrespective of whether or not the front
site is occupied.

Therefore, we propose a generalization of our origi-
nal model by incorporating both these possible scenarios
within a single model by introducing an interpolating pa-
rameter c with 0

our model, a motor in the state 2 returns to the state 1

the ratchet mechanism depends on the occupation of the
front site. This is the case that has been treated in [18],
where the release of ADP by a nucleotide-bound kinesin
is tightly controlled by the kinesin at the next binding
site in front of it. On the other hand, for c < 1 the tran-
sition rate will depend partially on the occupation of the
front site. For c = 0 the ADP release process becomes
completely independent of the state of the preceeding
site.

As long as the motor does not release ADP, it executes

random Brownian motion with the rate ωb.

(2) Dynamics at the ends
The probabilities of detachment and attachment at the
two ends of the microtubule can be diﬀerent from those
at any other site in the bulk. We choose α and δ, instead
of ωa, as the probabilities of attachment at the left and
right ends. Similarly, we take γ1 and β1, instead of ωd,
as probabilities of detachments at the left and right
ends, respectively (Fig. 1). Finally, γ2 and β2, instead
of ωb, are the probabilities of exit of the motors through
the two ends by random Brownian movements.

For the dynamical evolution of the system, one of the
L sites is picked up randomly and updated according to
the rules given below together with the corresponding
probabilities (Fig. 2):

Here X denotes an occupied site irrespective of the chem-

that is in either state 1 or state 2.

The ratchet mechanism (5) is triggered by the release
of ADP and summarizes the transitions of a particle from
state 2 to state 1. It distinguishes the two initial states
20, where the front site is empty, and 2X, where the
front site is occupied. We see that the overall transition
rate from state 2 to state 1 is ωs + ωf if the front site
is empty (initial state 20), and it is ωs + (1
c)ωf if
the front site is occupied (initial state 2X). This reﬂects
the dependence of the ADP release rate on the front site
occupation whenever c

= 0.

The physical processes captured by the rate constants
ωf and ωs can be understood as follows by analyzing
the Brownian ratchet mechanism illustrated in Fig. 3.
For the sake of simplicity, we consider only one molecu-
lar motor, and let us imagine that the potential seen by
the motor periodically oscillates between the sawtooth
shape and the ﬂat shape shown in Fig. 3. When the
sawtooth form remains “on” for some time, the particle

KIF1A is purely diﬀusive only when it is in the state 2
and the corresponding diﬀusion coeﬃcient is denoted by
the symbol D2. Using the measured diﬀusion constant

is switched “oﬀ”, the probability distribution of the po-
sition of the particle is given by a delta function which,
because of free diﬀusion in the absence of any force, be-
gins to spread. After some time the Gaussian proﬁle
spreads to such an extent that it has some overlap also
with the well in front, in addition to the overlap it has
with the original well. At that stage, when the sawtooth
potential is again switched on, there is a non-vanishing
probability that the particle will ﬁnd itself in the well
in front; this probability is proportional to the area of
the hatched part of the Gaussian proﬁle shown in Fig. 3
and is accounted for in our model by the parameter ωf .
There is also signiﬁcant probability that the particle will
fall back into the original well; this is captured in our
model by the parameter ωs.

III. COMPARISON WITH OTHER MODELS
FOR MOTOR TRAFFIC

In this section we compare our model with earlier mod-
els of molecular motor traﬃc. The ﬁrst two subsections
describe models developed for non-interacting molecu-
lar motors whereas in the last subsection we collect the
main results for the PFF model which has been intro-
duced to study collective eﬀects in motor traﬃc. A more
detailed comparison with models of interacting motors
will be taken up later in section V of this paper.

Chen [28] developed a model for single-headed kinesins
assuming a power stroke mechanism. He assumed that
each kinesin can attain three distinct states which were
labelled by the symbols 0, 1 and 2. The kinesin was
assumed to be detached from the microtubule in the state
0, but bound to microtubule in the other two states. The
states 1 and 2 were assumed to diﬀer from each other
by the amount of their tilt in the direction of motion.
The molecule steps ahead by exactly 8 nm in one cycle
consuming one ATP molecule. This power-stroke model
fails to account for several aspects of experimental data
(for example, the distribution of the steps sizes, including
backward steps) on KIF1A and, therefore, will not be
considered further for quantitative comparison.

A. Comparison with Sasaki’s Brownian ratchet
model

In contrast to the power-stroke model developed by
Chen [28], Sasaki [24] quantiﬁed the Brownian-ratchet
model for a single KIF1A motor proposed by Okada and
Hirokawa [19, 20]. He used the standard Fokker-Planck
approach [25, 26]. In this formulation, the particle, which
represents a kinesin, is assumed to be subjected to a time-
dependent periodic potential as given in Fig. 3. The po-
tential switches from one shape V1(x) to another shape
V2(x) with rate ω1 and the reverse switching takes place
at a rate ω2. One of the shapes of this potential V1(x)
is taken to be a periodic repetition of a saw-tooth where
each saw-tooth itself is asymmetric. Suppose, the height
of the maximum of each sawtooth is U . The shape of the
form of the potential V2(x) was assumed to be ﬂat, i.e.,
V2(x) = 0 for all x. Sasaki calculated the average speed v
and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D as functions of U , ω1 and
ω2.

One advantage of our model over Sasaki’s model is
that we do not make any ad-hoc assumption regarding
the shape of the potential as the potential does not enter
explicitly into our formulation. It is possible to identify

B. Comparison with Fisher-Kolomeisky multi-step
chemical kinetic model

Next we make a comparison between our model and
the multi-step chemical kinetic approach developed by
Fisher and Kolomeisky [29, 30, 31] for molecular motors.
In the simplest case of a single ﬁlament, the equispaced
binding sites on a microtubule are assumed to form a
one-dimensional lattice. It is assumed that there are M
distinct discrete intermediate chemical states on a bio-
chemical pathway between two consecutive binding sites.
The motor in state ji (i.e., in chemical state j located at
i
spatial position i where 1
L) can make
M , 1
j
transitions to the states (j +1)i and (j
1)i with the rates
uj and wj, respectively (see Fig. 5). Note that we have
labelled the chemical states in such a way that Mi = 1i+1
(Mi = 2 in Fig. 5) such that, completion of the chain in
forward (backward) transitions through these M states
would translocate the motor forward (backward) by one
lattice spacing.

FIG. 5: Fisher-Kolomeisky multi-step chemical kinetic model
of molecular motors.

Clearly, in the absence of attachment and detachment
of the motors, our model for a single KIF1A reduces to
the Fisher-Kolomeisky multi-step chemical kinetic model
of molecular motors on a single ﬁlament (see Fig.6) where
M = 2, as emphasized by a slight redrawing of our model
in Fig. 6.

Direct quantitative comparison with our model is also
possible. For example, in the special case where only
forward transitions are allowed and M = 2, the average
speed of the motor in the Fisher-Kolomeisky model is
given by

v =

u1u2
u1 + u2

(14)

where distance is measured in the units of spacing be-
tween two successive binding sites (8 nm in case of mi-
crotubule). In Sec. IV B we will derive an analogous ex-
pression for our model, see (19).

FIG. 6: In the absence of attachment and detachment, our
model is equivalent to Fisher-Kolomeisky model shown in
Fig. 5.

C. Comparison with PFF-model

The Parmeggiani-Franosch-Frey model (PFF model)
[13] combines the TASEP with Langmuir kinetics. The
motors are assumed to step forward one site with rate
p if the front site is empty, but do not move if this site
is occupied (exclusion). A backwards movement is not
possible. In addition, motors can attach to empty sites
with rate ωa and detach from a site with rate ωd. This
might be the simpliest model for intracellular transport
including adsorption and desorption. Although quite ba-
sic, it already reproduces the qualitative behavior of a
It not only shows

high-, low- and maximum-current phases like TASEP,
but also phase coexistence for distinct parameter ranges,
while phase domains are separated by stationary domain
walls (shocks). These shocks are also observed in ex-
periments [18]. Shock phases appear if the Langmuir
kinetics are of the same order as motor attachment and
detachment at the ends. It means that in the continious
limit where system size L
, the local attachment
and detachment rates ωa and ωd have to be rescaled so
that the global attachment and detachment rates deﬁned
as Ωa := ωaL, Ωd := ωdL stay constant. One can argue
that the topology of the phase diagram of the PFF model
is quite universal for systems that, as the PFF model,
possess a current-density relation with one single maxi-
mum and the same Langmuir kinetics [15], so even more
complex models might show similiar qualitative behavior
as the PFF model.

→ ∞

Although the PFF model reproduces qualitative prop-
erties of intracellular transport quite well, it is diﬃcult
to associate the hopping parameter p quantitatively with
experimentally accessible biochemical quantities because
the biochemical processes of a motor making one step
are usually quite complex. The PFF model does not
take into account these processes. Furthermore, it is not
possible to include interactions in the PFF model that

states of the motor. The advantage of our model is the
possibility of calibration of the model parameters with
experimentally controllable parameters ATP- or motor
protein concentration. Through the parameter c we can
include, at least phenomenologically, an interaction that
controls the transition from one state (2) to another (1).

IV. SINGLE MOTOR PROPERTIES AND
CALIBRATION

In this section we ﬁrst investigate the dynamics of our
model in the limit of vanishing inter-motor interactions.
This helps us to calibrate the model properly by com-
paring with empirical results. Then we compare the
non-interacting limit of our model as well as the cor-
responding results with earlier models of non-interacting
motors to elucidate the similarities and diﬀerences be-
tween them.

A. Calibration of our model in the low-density
limit

×

An important test of our model would be to check if
it reproduces the single molecule properties in the limit
of extremely low density of the motors. We have already
explained earlier how we extracted the numerical values
of the various parameters involved in our model. The
10−6 ms−1, allows real-
parameter values ωa = α = 1.0
ization of the condition of low density of kinesins. Using
those parameters sets, we carried out computer simula-
tions with microtubules of ﬁxed length L = 600 which is
the typical number of binding sites along a microtubule
ﬁlament. Each run of our simulation corresponds to a
duration of 1 minute of real time if each timestep is inter-
preted to to correspond to 1 ms. The numerical results of
our simulations of the model in this limit, including their
trend of variation with the model parameters, are in ex-
cellent agreement with the corresponding experimental
results (see Table I).

B. Non-interacting limit of our model: a
mean-ﬁeld analysis

For the case of a single KIF1A molecule, all interaction
terms can be neglected and the mean-ﬁeld equations (8),
(9) for the bulk dynamics are linearized and simplify to

The boundary equations (12)-(11) also get simpliﬁed in
a similar way.

Assuming periodic boundary conditions, the (homo-
geneous) solutions (Si, Wi) = (S, W ) of the mean-ﬁeld
equations (15), (16) in the steady-state are found to be

S =

(19)

where K = ωd/ωa, Ωh = ωh/ωf and Ωs = ωs/ωf .

If we make the correspondence u1 = ωh, and u2 = ωf
the expression (19) for the average speed of KIF1A in
our model, in the special case ωs = 0 (i.e., no reverse
transition) reduces to the Fisher-Kolomeisky result (14).
A more general version of the non-interacting limit of our
model is treated in appendix A.

V. COLLECTIVE FLOW PROPERTIES

In the following we will study the eﬀects of interac-
tions between motors which lead to interesting collective
phenomena.

A. Collective properties for c = 1

We ﬁrst look at the case c = 1 originally studied in
[18]. In mean-ﬁeld approximation the master equations
(8), (9) for the dynamics of the interacting KIF1A motors
in the bulk of the system are nonlinear. Note that each
term containing ωf is now multiplied by the factor of
the form (1
Wi) which incorporates the eﬀects of
mutual exclusion.

Thus, the density of the motors, irrespective of the in-

simplify to the forms

state 2 lead to forward hopping of the motor.

Thus, the result for the ﬂux in the special case can

Eq. (41) is the same equation as for the stationary PFF
model. Therefore, the phase diagram of this model would
be identical to that of the PFF model in mean ﬁeld ap-
proximation if we rescale all the parameters by (42)-(44).
One has to stress that this model is not exactly identical
to the PFF model. While mean ﬁeld approximation is ex-
act for the PFF model in the continuous limit, our model
shows correlations [33] that lead to diﬀerent density pro-
ﬁles and phase diagrams (see Sec. VI A). Nevertheless,
the topological structure of the phase diagrams remains
the same in both models and the diﬀerences are not quite
large.

So far we have discussed two possible scenarios of ADP
release by kinesin; in one of these the process depends on

empty binding sites on the microtubule. Total number of

it is autonomous in the other (c = 0). To our knowledge,
at present, the available experimental data can not rule
out either of these two scenarios of ATP hydrolysis by
kinesins. Therefore, we have introduced the parameter
c that interpolates both these possible scenarios. As we
have seen in this section, the extended model interpo-
lates, at least on the level of mean-ﬁeld theory, between
the PFF model and the model introduced in [18]. In the
following section we will discuss some properties of the
extended model including case 0 < c < 1 in more de-
tail. We focus on the density proﬁles and especially the
properties of shocks.

VI. POSITION OF THE SHOCK

One of the interesting results of the model is the exis-
tence of a domain wall separating the high-density and
low-density phases in the steady state of the system. One
such conﬁguration is shown in the space-time diagram in
Fig. 8 and the corresponding time-averaged density pro-
ﬁle of the motors are plotted in Fig. 9. In this section
we shall determine the position of the shock, i.e., the do-
main wall, and the trends of its variation with the model
parameters ωa and ωf , etc.

ditions (53). The discontinuity corresponds to a shock or

The continuity condition gives Jl = Jr where the ﬂow
just at the left side is denoted by Jl = ωf hl(1

that at the right is Jr. Thus we integrate (47) numerically
by using (50) to the right end, and we also integrate them

B. Shock position from simulations

In this subsection we locate the position of the shock
in our model using a new shock tracking probe (STP)
which is an extension of “second class particles” (SCP)
[34] used earlier for locating domain walls in computer
simulations of driven-diﬀusive lattice gas models deﬁned
on a discrete lattice. In the standard TASEP model, a
SCP is deﬁned as one that behaves as a particle while
exchanging position with a hole and behaves as a hole
while exchanging position with a particle. As a result,
the second class particle has a tendency to get localized

at the domain wall (or, the shock). Other types of STP
have also been considered in the literature [35]

supports the heuristic arguments used in the illustrative
examples in this paragraph.

In addition to the rules listed above we deﬁne the fol-

lowing fusion rules:

The rules for the movements of the STP in our model
of KIF1A traﬃc have been prescribed by extending those
for SCP in TASEP. Let us use the symbols ¯1 and ¯2 to
denote the STPs which correspond to the states 1 and
2, respectively, of the particles. Now, in the special case
c = 1, we deﬁne the following rules for the movements of
the STPs:

with X and ¯X denoting occupation in either state of
particles or STPs respectively, while
denotes a line
of sites occupied by particles. Further extension of these
rules for arbitrary c is straightforward.

· · ·

These rules satisfy the STP-principle:

if the selected
site is a STP it behaves like a particle, while if the se-
lected site is a particle it treats STPs in its vicinity as
holes (by changing sites respectively). Note that there
is no attachment and detachment of STPs. This is no
problem after all, because ωa and ωd scale like 1
L with
system size L and we are only looking at a local quan-
tity (the shock position), so they can be neglected for
large systems (which we are interested in). Besides, for
real (ﬁnite) systems they are negligibly small compared
to the other rates ωh, ωs, ωf and ωb. On the other hand,
if the STPs were allowed to detach, the undesirable pos-
sibility of losing all the STPs through detachments could
not be ruled out. Moreover, allowing STPs to attach and
detach like the real particles would involve further sub-
tleties of normalization during computation of averaged
quantities.

A STP, which is not located at the shock, has a ten-
dency to move to the shock position. Moreover, if a STP
is already located at the shock, it follows the shock as
the shock moves. For the purpose of illustration, consider
ﬁrst an idealized shock of the form ...0000XXXXXX... In-
serting a STP in either the low density region or the high
density region it is obvious from the rules given in (54)
that it will, on the average, move in the direction of the
shock. However, in our model, the observed shocks are
not ideal. Instead a few particles (holes) will appear in
the low (high) density region. As a ﬁrst approximation,
one can assume that these particles (holes) are isolated,
e.g. conﬁgurations like ...00X000XXX0XX... Again, by
careful use of the rules (54), one can show that the pre-
ferred motion of the STP is towards the location of the
shock also in such realistic situations. This argument can
be reﬁned even further.
In appendix B we present an
analytical argument in mean-ﬁeld approximation which

The fusion rules ensure that if a shock exists, there will
be a single STP in the system after suﬃciently long time.
This rule is extremely convenient because the lone STP
will uniquely deﬁne the position of the sharp shock rather
than a wide region of contiguous STPs separating the
high-density and low-density regions.

For the practical implementation of the STPs on the
computer, one has to select the initial positions of the
STPs. We chose to put one STP at each end of the sys-
tem at the beginning of the simulation. If a shock can
exist in the system, the STPs move to the shock position,
fuse and, ﬁnally, indicate the shock position. We deter-
mined the shock position in the stationary state by av-
eraging over the ﬂuctuating positions of the lone STP in
the steady state. In contrast, survival of two STPs in the
steady state of the system indicates absence of any shock;
instead, these two STPs indicate the formation of bound-
ary layers. Although the latter phenomenon could be in-
teresting, we shall not discuss it here. We have compared
the shock position obtained following the STP approach
with that inferred from the density proﬁles measured by
computer simulations of our model. These comparisons
established that the rules (54) and (55), indeed, yield the
correct results.

We determined numerically the mean position of shock
in a system with L = 600 sites as a function of ωa and
ωh which is shown as a 3D-plot in Fig. 11.

FIG. 11: Shock position as function of ωa and ωh obtained
from STP simulations.

In Fig. 12 we have plotted the shock positions as a
function of the parameter c for diﬀerent choices of ωs and
ωf . In this ﬁgure, one observes two plateaus connected
by a decaying domain (leftshift of the shock position).

It seems that upper plateau approximately ends for c =

to decide whether the sharp change in the position of the
shock at this value of c indicates merely a crossover or a
signature of a genuine phase transition.

VII. ANALYTICAL PHASE DIAGRAM
WITHOUT LANGMUIR DYNAMICS

In this section we derive the phase diagram in the plane
spanned by the boundary rates α and β for the special
case of our model where attachments and detachment of
the motors do not take place. In other words, we derive
the phase diagram of our model in the α
beta-plane in
the absence of Langmuir kinetics. We use the domain
wall theory proposed in [32] to derive this phase diagram
from the ﬂow-density relation (26) of the corresponding
periodic system. From this study, one can calculate the
collective velocity and the shock velocity which determine
the dynamics of the density proﬁles of the open system.
Note that, because of the translational invariance of the
periodic system, S and W show constant density proﬁles.
The collective velocity vc of this system is given by

kinesins labeled with a red ﬂuorescent dye were then in-
troduced into the cell together with with ATP. The move-
ment of the motor proteins was observed using imaging
techniques of optical microscopy described in [19]. A
“comet-like” structure, as shown in Fig. 14, was formed
by the kinesins (red) on the microtubule (green). The
ﬁrst two images from the top, which correspond to low
and moderate densities, respectively, were taken under
essentially same conditions, but the lowermost image in
the ﬁgure was taken with smaller intensiﬁer gain, because
it is too bright for the intensiﬁer.

No special ﬁltering was applied to the original image.
Each red ﬂuorescent spot in Fig. 14 normally corresponds
to a single ﬂuorescently-labeled kinesin molecule, if the
density is not too high (top panel of Fig. 14 is a typi-
cal example of such cases). Due to the optical resolu-
tion limit (about 500 nm), more than one kinesin can
together form a single brighter spot when the motors are
too close to be resolved (as happens, for example, in the
middle panel of Fig. 14). Nevertheless, even in such sit-
uations, the number of ﬂuorochromes in each spot can
be estimated from its intensity. At much higher densities
(for example, that corresponding to the bottom panel of
Fig. 14), ﬂuorescent signals are no longer separable as
spots. Even in such cases, the density of ﬂuorochromes
can be estimated from their intensity proﬁle. However,
Okada measured the intensity proﬁle just to conﬁrm that
each spot corresponds to a single kinesin molecule in the
lowest density experiment. In other words, at low densi-
ties, the density of the ﬂuorescent spots gives a good esti-
mate for the density of kinesins. But, at higher densities,
the spot density gives an underestimate of the kinesin
density due to the overlap of ﬂuorescent spots (which are
not visually separable because of the limited resolution).

14

FIG. 14: A “comet-like” structure formed by kinesins (red)
on the microtubule (green). The high-density and low-density
egions are clearly separated in this image.

It is true that, under normal physiological conditions,
the global density of motors in a cell never oversaturates
the microtubule surface as happened in Okada’s exper-
iment described above. However, so far as the in-vivo
situations are concerned, the motors and microtubules
are heterogeneously distributed in cells. Thus, the local
density of motors and microtubule surfaces might be a
direct determinant of the formation of motor traﬃc jam
within cells during in-vivo experiments. Moreover, in
pathological situations, traﬃc jam on microtubule-based
transport systems, such as axonal transport, is not rare.
In fact, such traﬃc jams have been implicated in many
neurodegenerative diseases [36, 37, 38]. Many putative
factors may contribute to the “jammorigenesis”; these
include the population of the active motor proteins, the
presence of the inactive motor proteins, the number of
“obstacles” on the microtubule surface such as micro-
tubule associated proteins, and so on. Obviously, these
factors should be, ultimately, incorporated into a more
“realistic” extended version of our model in order to ex-
plicitly account for the observed “jammorigenesis”. The
current version of our model is just the minimal one.

These experimental results have three important impli-
cations. First, traﬃc jam can actually take place in living
cells at least in some experimental conditions. Second,
the local concentration, rather than the global concentra-
tion, of the motors determines whether or not jam will
form in a living cell. Even in the overexpressing cells,
the overall concentration of motors is much lower than
that of tubulin. But still “comet” is formed. Third, neg-
ative regulation systems, which are not included in the
current version of our model, prevent jam formation in
physiological situations.

IX. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have proposed a biologically moti-
vated extension of our recent quantitative model [18] de-

scribing traﬃc-like collective movement of single-headed
kinesin motors KIF1A. The dynamics of the system has
been formulated in terms of a stochastic process where
position of a motor is repesented by a discrete variable
and time is continuous. The model explicitly captures the
most essential features of the biochemical cycle of each
motor by assigning two discrete internal (“chemical” or
“conformational”) states to each motor. It not only takes
into account the exclusion interactions, as in the previ-
ous models, but also includes a possible interaction of
motors that controls ADP release rates by introducing a
free parameter c. To our knowledge [27], it is not possible
even to establish the existence of this mechano-chemical
interaction with the experimental data currently avail-
able in the literature. However, we hope that our results
reported here will help in developing experimental meth-
ods which will not only test the existence of this inter-
action but also its strength if it exists. For example, we
have predicted the dependence of the shock position on
c (and, therefore, that of c on the shock position). Thus,
at least in prinicple, one could determine c by compar-
ing the experimentally measured shock position with this
relation. The c-dependence of some of the other quan-
tities reported here may provide alternative, and possi-
bly, more direct way of estimating the strength of this
mechano-chemical interaction.

We have compared and contrasted our model and the
results with earlier generic models of single motors as well
as those of motor traﬃc. Our analytical treatment of the
dynamical equations in the continuum limit (i.e., a limit
in which the spatial position of each motor is denoted by
a continuous variable) has also established the occurrence
of a non-propagating shock in this model. We have also
calculated the position of this shock numerically using
the method of second class particles.

−

Mean ﬁeld treatment of the rate equations for c = 0
showed that this special case of our model is equivalent to
the simpler PFF model which also predicts two-phase co-
existence (where the two phases are separated by a non-
propagating shock). One can argue analytically [15, 33],
as we also observed in simulations, that the general fea-
β-phase diagrams of our model is the
tures of the α
same as those for the PFF model. Thus, the PFF model,
in spite of its simplicity, captures the essential generic
features of intracellular transport. But, it is not possi-
ble to make direct quantitative comparison between the
predictions of the PFF model and experimental data as
the parameters of the PFF model are not accessible to
direct biochemical experiments. In contrast, our model
captures the essential features of the internal biochemical
transitions of each single-headed kinesin and we could es-
tablish a one to one correspondence between our model
parameters and measurable quantities. The concentra-
tions of the kinesin motors and ATP are two such impor-
tant parameters both of which which are variable in-vivo
and can be controlled in in-vitro-experiments. We have
reported the phase diagram of our model in the plane
spanned by these experimentally accessible parameters.

15

Finally, we have summarized evidences for the forma-
tion of molecular motor jam from Okada’s in-vitro exper-
iments [18] and discussed their relevance in intra-cellular
transport under physiological conditions.

Appendix A: A GENERALIZED MODEL OF NON-
INTERACTING MOTORS

In order to make a comparison between the non-
interacting limit of our model and the earlier models
of non-interacting molecular motors, we consider here a
slightly more general model which allows “reverse” tran-
sitions for each of the “forward” transitions. Then we
show that the non-interacting limit of our model is a
special case of the general model while some other spe-
cial cases correspond to earlier models of non-interacting
motors.

FIG. 15: Schematic description of a general three-state model
of a single molecular motor.

Consider the multi-step chemical kinetic scheme shown
in the Fig. 15. Note that this generalized scheme [39] al-
lows a transition from the strongly bound state at i + 1
−
to the weakly bound state at i with the rate constant ω
f
which is not allowed in our model shown in ﬁg.2. In fact,

in this generalized scheme, corresponding to every for-
ward step (those corresponding to ω+
h and ωb) there

h and ωb, re-
is a backward step (corresponding to ω
spectively). This generalization is in the spirit of Fisher-
Kolomeisky-type multi-step chemical kinetic models of
molecular motors [29, 30, 31] where each of the reactions
are allowed to be reversible, albeit with diﬀerent rate
constants, in general.

time the average position of the STP will be equal to the
shock position.

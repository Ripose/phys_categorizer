Summary. We study the competition between several advantageous mutants in
an asexual population (clonal interference) as a function of the time between the
appearance of the mutants ∆t, their selective advantages, and the rate of deleterious
mutations. We ﬁnd that the overall probability of ﬁxation (the probability that at
least one of the mutants becomes the ancestor of the entire population) does not
depend on the time interval between the appearance of these mutants, and equals
the probability that a genotype bearing all of these mutations reaches ﬁxation.
This result holds also in the presence of deleterious mutations, and for an arbitrary
number of competing mutants. We also show that if mutations interfere, an increase
in the mean number of ﬁxation events is associated with a decrease in the expected
ﬁtness gain of the population.

1 Introduction

Evolution, according to Dobzhansky (1973), is the unifying concept that pulls
together all the diﬀerent strands of biology. Indeed, while evolution provides
the framework to understand the otherwise bewildering panoply of adapted
forms, it also allows us to understand the patterns that mutation and se-
lection leave in the molecules of life, namely DNA and proteins. One of the
central problems of the branch of biology that is devoted to the systemat-
ics of the tree of all living things, molecular evolution, concerns the rate of
adaptation of individual organisms and species. A precise understanding of
molecular phylogeny requires accurate models of evolution and adaptation.
In this contribution, we model the adaptation of chromosomes that do not
undergo recombination, or more generally, the rate of adaptation of asexual
organisms.

The main observation that we study here is that the rate of adaptation of
asexual organisms, or of regions of low recombination in the genomes of sexual
organisms, does not steadily increase with increasing rate of advantageous
mutations. When two or more advantageous mutations appear in diﬀerent
organisms at approximately the same time, then only one of them can go

2

to ﬁxation, i.e., become shared by all members of the population, while the
others will be lost. This loss of potentially beneﬁcial mutations limits the rate
of adaptation to the rate at which individual mutants can go to ﬁxation. By
contrast, in sexual organisms, several mutations can recombine and thus go to
ﬁxation together. This interference of advantageous mutations has long been
recognized as a potential disadvantage of asexual populations (Fisher, 1930;
Muller, 1964; Hill and Robertson, 1966). Recently, several groups have worked
on an exact quantiﬁcation of the interference eﬀect, both in theoretical studies
(Barton, 1995; Gerrish and Lenski, 1998; Orr, 2000; Gerrish, 2001; McVean
and Charlesworth, 2000) and in experimental studies with bacteria (de Visser
et al., 1999; Rozen et al., 2002; Shaver et al., 2002) and viruses (Miralles
et al., 1999; Cuevas et al., 2002). A good quantitative understanding of the
interference eﬀect is necessary in order to assess the inﬂuence that interference
has on the patterns of molecular evolution and variation in large populations.
There are two separate dynamics that both contribute to the overall in-
terference eﬀect: First, if two advantageous mutants are both present in suﬃ-
ciently high concentrations, such that loss to drift can be neglected, then they
compete deterministically, and the mutant with the higher selective advantage
will replace the other one. Second, if at least one advantageous mutant is still
very rare, then we have to consider the inﬂuence of other mutants’ presence on
the chance that this mutant is lost to drift. To date, there is no single theory
that takes into account both dynamics to their full extent. Gerrish and Lenski
(1998) calculated the speed of adaptation as a function of population size and
beneﬁcial mutation rate, under the assumption that clonal interference can be
neglected during the initial phase of drift. They assumed that the probability
that a mutant is not lost to drift corresponds to one minus the standard prob-
ability of ﬁxation (as calculated for example by Fisher 1922, Haldane 1927,
Kimura 1962) of that mutant. Orr (2000) modiﬁed the calculations of Ger-
rish and Lenski to include beneﬁcial mutations that arise in genomes bearing
one or more deleterious mutations, but also did not address the eﬀect of in-
terference of other beneﬁcial mutations during the initial phase of drift. In
general, the inﬂuence of deleterious mutations on the probability of ﬁxation
has been studied extensively (Manning and Thompson, 1984; Charlesworth,
1994; Peck, 1994; Johnson and Barton, 2002), but there are very few studies
that consider the eﬀect of interfering beneﬁcial mutations. The problem of
interfering advantageous mutations is that there exists no simple theoretical
framework with which their inﬂuence on drift can be described accurately.
Barton (1995) derived an approximation that allowed him to calculate the
probability of ﬁxation of a mutant in a population that is undergoing a selec-
tive sweep. However, his approximation is valid only for very small selective
advantages. McVean and Charlesworth (2000) studied a similar situation with
numerical simulations, and applied their results to codon bias and levels of
polymorphism in molecular evolution.

Here, we study the mutual interference of two advantageous mutants that
are each initially present in only a single organism. We derive a phenomeno-

Modeling Stochastic Clonal Interference

logical description of the mutants’ ﬁxation probabilities in the interference
regime. This phenomenological description, which is in essence an interpola-
tion between limiting cases that can be described with standard theory, agrees
very well with numerical simulations. We also ﬁnd that the expected ﬁtness
increase of the population is maximized if the mutant with higher selective ad-
vantage arrives earlier, even though this order of appearance leads, on average,
to fewer mutants that go to ﬁxation.

2 Model

We consider three distinct sequence types: wild type, advantageous mutant
1, and advantageous mutant 2, with ﬁtness values 1, 1 + s1, and 1 + s2,
respectively. Thus, s1 denotes the selective advantage of mutants of type 1, and
s2 is the selective advantage of mutants of type 2. For simplicity, we assume
that s2 > s1. Initially, the population is homogeneous and consists of the wild
type only. Then, one randomly chosen wild type individual is replaced by an
advantageous mutant of either type, and some ∆t generations later, another
randomly chosen individual of the population (either wild type or mutant)
is replaced by a mutant of the other type. Throughout this paper, we will
understand ∆t to be the diﬀerence in generations between the appearance of
mutant 2 and mutant 1, so that negative values of ∆t indicate that mutant 2
appeared before mutant 1.

The population is ﬁnite of size N , and replication takes place in discrete
generations, according to the Wright-Fisher model: All individuals in genera-
tion t are direct descendants of the individuals of the previous generation; the
probability that an individual is the oﬀspring of a particular parent is pro-
portional to the parent’s ﬁtness. We introduce deleterious mutations into the
oﬀspring organisms with probability u. If a mutant of type 1 or 2 is hit by a
mutation, then its ﬁtness is set to 1 (that is, it reverts to the lower ﬁtness wild
type). We do not consider deleterious mutations in the wild type genotype.

We consider a genotype to be ﬁxed if it has become the most-recent com-
mon ancestor of the whole population, regardless of whether some individuals
in the population have a diﬀerent genotype. This deﬁnition of ﬁxation has
been used recently to study ﬁxation of beneﬁcial mutations in a heteroge-
neous genetic background (Barton, 1995; Johnson and Barton, 2002), and
also to investigate the process of ﬁxation in a viral quasispecies (Wilke, 2003).

3 Theoretical analysis

3.1 Probability of ultimate ﬁxation

In the Appendix, we derive equations for the probability of ﬁxation P (s, u) and
time to ﬁxation T (s, u) of an individual mutant with selective advantage s and

4

mutation rate u. For two mutants, we are mostly interested in the probability
of ultimate ﬁxation, that is, the probability that a mutant reaches ﬁxation
and is not subsequently replaced by the other mutant. In the following, we
will denote the probability that mutant i reaches ultimate ﬁxation under the
condition that the two mutants are introduced ∆t generations apart as πi(∆t).
We can calculate πi(∆t) for the two limiting cases ∆t → −∞ and ∆t → ∞,
and present a phenomenological description for intermediate ∆t.

For ∆t → −∞, that is, when mutant 2 arises much earlier than mutant 1,

we have

(1)
(2)

(3)

π1(−∞) = [1 − P (s2, u)]P (s1, u) ,
π2(−∞) = P (s2, u) .

Since s2 > s1, mutant 1 can reach ﬁxation only when mutant 2 has not reached
ﬁxation. For ∆t → ∞, we have to consider the possibility that mutant 1
reaches ﬁxation ﬁrst, but is later replaced by mutant 2. Therefore, we ﬁnd

where P (
(1+s1)(1−u) − 1, u) is the probability that mutant 2 goes to ﬁxation
(1+s1)(1−u) − 1, u) is
after mutant 1 has already reached ﬁxation. Since P (
always smaller than or equal to P (s2, u), we have π1(−∞) ≤ π1(∞) and
π2(−∞) ≥ π2(∞). In other words, both mutants have a higher probability of
ﬁxation when they are introduced ﬁrst than when they are introduced second.
For intermediate values of ∆t, there is no theory that enables us to de-
rive a simple expression for πi(∆t) (but see Barton 1995). We cannot use
branching process theory, because it assumes that the presence of the invading
mutants does not inﬂuence the mean ﬁtness (which they do for intermediate
∆t). Also, diﬀusion theory becomes unwieldy when there are more than 2
diﬀerent sequence types. Nevertheless, we have found that we can develop a
phenomenological description of the competition of two mutants as follows.
We know that πi(t) must reach the two limiting values πi(∞) and πi(−∞)
for suﬃciently large positive or negative ∆t. Moreover, as long as ∆t < 0,
we do not expect πi(∆t) to be very diﬀerent from πi(−∞), because mutant
1 has only a realistic chance of proliferating and going to ﬁxation if mutant
2 is not present in the population. As long as ∆t . 0, mutant 2 will either
go to ﬁxation relatively unscathed from the later appearance of mutant 1,
or it will be lost to drift, in which case mutant 1 will have its turn. Like-
wise, for ∆t larger than the time to ﬁxation of mutant 1, T1, we expect that
πi(∆t) = πi(∞), because T1 generations after the introduction of mutant 1,
mutant 2 will either ﬁnd a population in which mutant 1 has already gone
to ﬁxation, or one in which it has been lost to drift. For 0 . ∆t . T1, we

Modeling Stochastic Clonal Interference

5

expect that π1(∆t) smoothly increases from π1(−∞) to π1(∞), while π2(∆t)
smoothly decreases from π2(−∞) to π2(∞). These considerations suggest a
sigmoidal form for πi(∆t). We use a logistic growth model to describe the
smooth transition from πi(−∞) to πi(∞) within the range 0 . ∆t . T1:

πi(∆t) = πi(−∞) +

πi(∞) − πi(−∞)
1 + e−γ1(∆t−T1/2) ,

(5)

where γ1 is the ﬁtness advantage of mutant 1 at ﬁnite mutation rate (see
the deﬁnition following Eq. (8) below). This expression appears to be an
acceptable description of the exact time dependence (see Numerical Results)
without free parameters.

3.2 Overall probability of ﬁxation

Besides the individual probabilities π1(∆t) and π2(∆t), their sum π =
π1(∆t) + π2(∆t) is also of interest. This sum is the overall probability that at
least one mutant goes to ﬁxation. When we sum Eqs. (1) and (2), or Eqs. (3)
and (4), we ﬁnd that the overall ﬁxation probability does not depend on the
order in which the mutants are introduced, and has the form

π = P (s1, u) + P (s2, u) − P (s1, u)P (s2, u) .

(6)

Furthermore, if Eq. (5) is indeed a good description of πi(∆t) for arbitrary
∆t, then π should not depend on ∆t at all, because all time dependencies
cancel when we use Eq. (5) to calculate π1(∆t) + π2(∆t).

The invariance of the overall ﬁxation probability π under the order by
which the mutants appear is a general property. It holds also when more than
2 mutants arise: Assume that n advantageous mutants arise, with selective
advantages s1, . . . , sn compared to the wild type. Further assume that the
time intervals between the appearances of the mutants are large. Then, the
n
i=1[1 − P (si, u)],
probability that none of the mutants make it to ﬁxation is
regardless of the order of their appearance. The probability that at least one
mutant goes to ﬁxation is therefore

Y

which reduces to Eq. (6) in the case of n = 2. Using an extension of Kimura’s
well-known result for P (si, u) derived in the Appendix, Eq. (A.4), we can
simplify this expression even further. We ﬁnd in the limit N → ∞:

π = 1 − exp [−2 (γ1 + γ2 + · · · + γn)] ,

(8)

with γi = (1 + si)(1 − u) − 1 for u < si/(1 + si), and γi = 0 otherwise.
Moreover, in the absence of deleterious mutations, for u = 0, π becomes

6

Paulo R.A. Campos, Christoph Adami, and Claus O. Wilke

π = 1 − exp [−2 (s1 + s2 + · · · + sn)] .

(9)

In this limit, the overall probability of ﬁxation is the same as the probability
of ﬁxation of a single mutant with selective advantage s equal to the sum of
the selective advantages of all invading mutants, s =
i si. Such a hypothet-
ical mutant is extremely unlikely in clonal populations, because all beneﬁcial
mutations would have to hit the lineage sequentially, but could occur when
beneﬁcial mutations are shared via recombination. In the limit that all γi
vanish (that is, for very large mutation rates or for vanishing si), Eq. (7)
becomes

3.3 Expected ﬁtness increase and expected number of ﬁxed
mutants

Depending on which mutant goes to ﬁxation, the average ﬁtness of the ﬁnal
population is either 1, 1+γ1, or 1+γ2, with γ as deﬁned following Eq. (8). The
expected ﬁtness increase hγ(∆t)i after the introduction of the two mutants is
therefore

hγ(∆t)i = γ1π1(∆t) + γ2π2(∆t) .

(11)

Since we know that π1(∆t) + π2(∆t) is constant, and γ2 ≥ γ1 as a direct
consequence of our assumption s2 > s1, it follows that hγ(−∞)i ≥ hγ(∞)i. If
we write π1(∞) = π1(−∞) + ∆π, and π2(−∞) = π2(∞) + ∆π, then we ﬁnd

hγ(−∞)i − hγ(∞)i = (γ2 − γ1)∆π ≥ 0 .

(12)

Thus, the expected ﬁtness increase is larger if we introduce the mutant with
the higher selective advantage ﬁrst.

Let nﬁx denote the number of ﬁxed mutants, that is, we have nﬁx = 0
if none of the mutants reach ﬁxation, nﬁx = 1 if exactly one of the mutants
reaches ﬁxation, and nﬁx = 2 if ﬁrst mutant 1 reaches ﬁxation and is later
replaced by mutant 2. For ∆t → −∞ and N large, nﬁx can never be larger than
one, because the probability that mutant 1 goes to ﬁxation in the background
of mutant 2 is zero. We ﬁnd in this limit for the expected value of nﬁx:

hnﬁx(−∞)i = π1(−∞) + π2(−∞) = π .

(13)

In the limit ∆t → ∞, on the other hand, we ﬁnd

hnﬁx(∞)i = π1(−∞) + π2(−∞) + P (s1, u)P

= π + P (s1, u)P

Clearly, hnﬁx(∞)i ≥ hnﬁx(−∞)i. This means that if the mutant with the
smaller selective advantage appears before the mutant with the larger selective

7

advantage, then the expected number of mutants that go to ﬁxation is larger
than if the mutant with the larger selective advantage appears ﬁrst. However,
at the same time the expected increase in average ﬁtness is smaller, as we saw
in the previous paragraph.

4 Numerical Simulation

In order to measure ﬁxation probabilities, we carried out 100, 000 replicates
of the simulation for each set of parameters, and recorded the ﬁnal outcome
(all individuals unmarked, or marked as descendants of either advantageous
mutant). We studied a population of size N = 1000 and mutation rates u =
0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8. The
selective advantages were s1 = 0.1 and s2 = 0.2, s1 = 0.1 and s2 = 0.5,
s1 = 0.05 and s2 = 0.2. We also studied a population of size N = 10, 000
for a subset of these parameters, in order to make sure that our results were
robust against a change in population size. Because of the sizable amount of
CPU time needed to carry out 100,000 replicates for N = 10, 000, we could
however not study this case exhaustively.

In order to keep track of the evolutionary history of each mutant, we
marked the initial mutants 1 and 2 with two distinct inheritable neutral mark-
ers. In that way, we could distinguish wild type sequences that were descen-
dants from mutants 1 or 2 from the wild type sequences that were originally
present. We continued all simulations until all individuals in the population
were either unmarked, marked as descendants of mutant 1, or marked as de-
scendants of mutant 2.

Figure 1 shows the probability of ultimate ﬁxation of mutants 1 and 2, π1
and π2, and the overall probability of ﬁxation π = π1 + π2, for u = 0. We see
that the probability π1 is constant for ∆t < 0, and starts to increase as soon
as ∆t turns positive. Eventually, π1 levels oﬀ again. We observe the opposite
behavior for the probability π2. For ∆t < 0, π2 is constant, but decreases
rapidly in the same range of ∆t in which π1 increases. Finally, π2 levels oﬀ as
well.

The overall probability of ﬁxation π is approximately constant for all values
of ∆t. The solid lines in Fig. 1a and b correspond to Eq. (5), and the solid line
in Fig. 1c is π1(−∞)+π2(−∞). We ﬁnd that our phenomenological description
Eq. (5) performs very well for intermediate ∆t.

In Fig. 2 we plot the same quantities as those shown in Figure 1, but now
with a positive mutation rate u = 0.05. We observe that the two probabilities
π1 and π2 have smaller values than in the absence of mutations. The phe-
nomenological description still works well, and appears to correctly take into
account the eﬀects of mutation. The overall ﬁxation probability π is again
independent of ∆t. In Figure 3 we show the time to ﬁxation of mutant 1, T1,
and the time to ﬁxation of mutant 2, T2, as functions of ∆t. The parameter

values are the same as those of Figure 1. In Figure 3a, we see that T1 is ap-
proximately constant for all values of ∆t except for the range 0 ≤ ∆t ≤ 200.
For negative ∆t the ﬁxation of mutant 1 occurs only when mutant 2 has been
eliminated. Therefore, T1 corresponds to the result for the ﬁxation time of a
mutant with selective advantage s1 in a homogeneous population with wild-
type individuals only. The same is true for large positive ∆t because there
mutant 1 has enough time to reach ﬁxation without the interference of the
second mutant. For small positive ∆t, we observe a decrease of T1. The de-
crease occurs for those ∆t for which the two beneﬁcial mutants coexist for
several generations in the population. Fixation of mutant 1 in this regime
occurs only when mutant 1 reaches ﬁxation so quickly that mutant 2 has not
had time to build up momentum. Otherwise, most likely mutant 1 will be
displaced by mutant 2 before reaching ﬁxation. For mutant 2, the time to
ﬁxation T2 is shorter for negative ∆t than for positive ∆t. For positive ∆t, in

a fraction of cases mutant 2 has to go to ﬁxation in a background of mutant
1, rather than in a background of wild type. In the background of mutant 1,
the selective advantage of mutant 2 is smaller than in a wild-type population,
which explains the increased time to ﬁxation. Interestingly, before T2 starts
to rise for increasing positive ∆t, it quickly spikes at ∆t ≈ 30. This spike
has the following explanation: If mutant 1 is introduced right before mutant
2 has reached ﬁxation, then the time to ﬁxation of mutant 2 is increased by
the additional time it takes for mutant 1 to disappear again. This additional
time will typically be one or two generations, which is in agreement with the
height of the spike. (T1 on the top of the spike is actually approximately half
a generation larger than before the spike.) The limiting values for π1 and π2
when ∆t → −∞ and ∆t → −∞ were estimated by means of branching pro-
cess theory which provides very good accuracy, especially for low mutation
values.

In Figure 4 we show the ﬁxation times T1 and T2 as a function of mutation

theory, Eq. (A.5). As we increase the mutation rate u, the population moves
from a strong selection regime, characterized by a short time to ﬁxation, to a
neutral regime, where T ≈ 2N . We also observe that the transition between
these two regimes occurs at diﬀerent mutation rates for the two genotypes: T1

T2 reaches the neutral regime around u = u2c ≈ 0.30. The mutation rate at
which this transition occurs is known as the error threshold (Eigen, 1971).

In Figure 5 we can see the overall probability of ﬁxation as a function
of mutation rate for the case of two as well as three interfering mutants.
Simulation results are again compared to the diﬀusion theory result Eq. (A.4),
but also to a prediction from branching process theory, Eq. (A.14). For these
simulations, we used s1 = 0.1, s2 = 0.5 and population size N = 1000.
We also chose a time interval ∆t = 100, which is smaller than the time
required for ﬁxation of mutant 1, to ensure that the dynamics takes place
in the clonal interference regime. Above the error threshold, the probability
of ﬁxation is known to be 1/N for a single mutation (2/N and 3/N for two
or three mutants, respectively). Because the branching process description
assumes inﬁnite population size, it predicts zero probability of ﬁxation above
the error threshold. Diﬀusion theory, on the other hand, describes this regime
adequately, while being less accurate at small mutation rates. The abrupt
change between the ordered and disordered regime predicted by both theories
is not present in the numerical data because the simulated system is ﬁnite.

(5).

Finally, we tested the prediction that the mean number of ﬁxations in the
population is larger when the mutant with the smaller selective advantage
is introduced ﬁrst, even though the mean ﬁtness increase is smaller. Figure
6a shows the results for the expected increase in ﬁtness as a function of the
time interval ∆t as deﬁned in Eq. (11), as well as the solution of Eq. (11)
using a sigmoidal ansatz for the probabilities π1 and π2, as deﬁned in Eq. (5).
As expected, the mean ﬁtness gain decreases as ∆t turns positive, while the
expected number of ﬁxed mutants, shown in Figure 6b, increases.

5 Discussion

The rate of adaptation of a non-recombining chromosome or asexual popula-
tion is a non-trivial quantity that depends on details of the ﬁtness distribution
of mutations. Beneﬁcial mutations often take a long time to dominate in a
population, and compete against each other in the background of deleterious
mutations. The probability of ﬁxation of any one mutation depends on the
time of their introduction, stochastic drift, and the prevalent mutation rate.
A good understanding of the rate of adaptation of asexuals is important in
molecular phylogeny, because it inﬂuences the speed of the assumed molec-
ular clock (Kuhner and Felsenstein, 1994). Since successive ﬁxation events
determine the branchings in the phylogenetic tree, a stochastic analysis of the

Modeling Stochastic Clonal Interference

13

ﬁxation probability of competing mutations can provide insight into models
of evolution used for tree reconstruction methods (Page and Holmes, 1998).
We studied the probability of ﬁxation of beneﬁcial mutations in the pres-
ence of other beneﬁcial mutations that were introduced either earlier or later,
and in the presence of other deleterious mutations, that is, we studied ﬁxation
in a non-equilibrium background. This problem has been addressed previously
by Barton (1995) using a deterministic approach, which was unfortunately
limited to small selective advantages. Similarly, Johnson and Barton (2002)
studied the probability of ﬁxation in a changing background, but they con-
ﬁned themselves mostly to the case where deleterious mutations accumulate
in the background after a selective sweep.

We found that the probability of ﬁxation is easily understood from an
analytic point of view as long as the time interval between the introduction
of mutants is larger than the ﬁxation time of the least beneﬁcial mutation.
In the interference regime, where the population consists of clones of the wild
type as well as both beneﬁcial mutants, a phenomenological approach based
on logistic growth is successful at describing the competition. In general, we
ﬁnd that the probability of ﬁxation of the most beneﬁcial mutant is reduced
when it competes against a less beneﬁcial mutant, and there is a sizable prob-
ability that the less beneﬁcial mutant will in fact survive (see Fig. 1). Yet, the
probability that either one of the mutants survives does not depend on the
timing of their introduction.

A number of authors noted the reduction of ﬁxation probabilities caused by
segregating deleterious mutations (Peck, 1994; Manning and Thompson, 1984;
Charlesworth, 1994; Orr, 2000; Johnson and Barton, 2002), and we observe
the same qualitative behavior here. We ﬁnd that a background of deleterious
mutations suppresses the ﬁxation probability, and this suppression is more
pronounced for the less beneﬁcial mutant. In the model presented here, there
is a simple relationship between beneﬁcial and deleterious mutations: Each
mutation occurring on a clone created by a beneﬁcial mutation is reduced to
the wild type ﬁtness. This simpliﬁed model corresponds to a single-peak land-
scape, exhaustively studied in the context of quasispecies theory (Tarazona,
1992; Swetina and Schuster, 1982; Galluccio, 1997; Campos and Fontanari,
1998). Consequently, we expect a more pronounced decrease of the probabil-
ity of ﬁxation for small s due to the existence of an error-threshold, i.e., a
point at which information is lost from the sequence due to a critically high
mutation rate, see Eigen (1971). In the stochastic regime of evolution, which
occurs for mutation rates above the error threshold, individuals replicate ran-
domly, and each member of the population is expected to be the most recent
ancestor of the population with the same probability π = 1/N while the time
to ﬁxation is T = 2N (Kimura, 1968; Kingman, 1982; Donnelly and Tavar´e,
1995). This prediction is conﬁrmed in Figure 4, where we see that for large u
both T1 and T2 are approximately equal to 2N . Accordingly, in the interval
u1c < u < u2c, where uic denotes the error-threshold for genotype of type i,
we can describe the dynamics by ignoring the less beneﬁcial mutant.

The explicit modeling of stochastic interference between beneﬁcial mu-
tation revealed an interesting observation concerning the mean number of
ﬁxation events and the expected ﬁtness change. Naively one might surmise
that, as the number of ﬁxation events increases, so does the expected increase
in ﬁtness. Instead, we found the opposite dynamic: Fig. 6 clearly shows that if
the mutant with the smaller selective advantage appears ﬁrst, then we expect
more ﬁxation events because the second mutant then has a good chance to
survive. Yet, this is not the best scenario if we are interested in maximizing
ﬁtness: In this case, it is better if the most beneﬁcial mutant can establish
itself ﬁrst, even though this implies that there is little chance for another
ﬁxation event.

Finally, we observed that the probability for any beneﬁcial mutant to go
to ﬁxation is equal to the probability that a genotype bearing all mutations
will become the ancestor of the entire population. Moreover, this observation
holds for an arbitrary number of competing mutations, even in the presence
of deleterious mutations, independently of the order of appearance of the ben-
eﬁcial mutations. Naturally, while such a probability is very high if the sum
of all beneﬁts is large, the probability of a single sequence appearing with this
combination of mutations is exponentially small in non-recombining popula-
tions. This result was conﬁrmed using an extension of Kimura’s result (1962)
to ﬁnite mutation rates [Eq. (A.4)] and also by means of a branching pro-
cess formulation. Both approaches yield similar results and are in excellent
agreement with our numerical simulations. We ﬁnd that the branching pro-
cess approach is more accurate at low mutation rates, away from the error
threshold. As it is formulated in the N → ∞ limit, it fails to predict the
asymptotic result π ≈ n/N which is reached in the limit that all γi vanish.

The present analysis concerns the rate of adaptation as beneﬁcial muta-
tions compete against each other in the presence of deleterious mutations, in
a non-equilibrium framework. This is a step towards the goal of characterizing
the rate of adaptation of whole populations in arbitrary circumstances, and in
the presence of recombination. We expect that these extensions are necessary
before accurate predictions of optimal mutation rates in biological evolution
can be made.

A Probability of ﬁxation and time to ﬁxation for an
individual mutant

We can calculate the probability of ﬁxation of an individual mutant either
from branching process theory (Fisher, 1922; Haldane, 1927; Fisher, 1930;
Barton, 1995; Johnson and Barton, 2002; Wilke, 2003) or from diﬀusion the-
ory (Kimura, 1962). Branching process theory is applicable for very large
population sizes, and arbitrary (but positive) selective advantages s. Diﬀusion
theory is applicable to moderately large to large population sizes and small
or even vanishing selective advantages s. Moreover, diﬀusion theory also gives
an expression for the expected time to ﬁxation.

A.1 Diﬀusion theory

If the advantageous mutant suﬀers additional mutations while it goes to ﬁx-
ation, then we typically have to use multi-dimensional diﬀusion equations,

Modeling Stochastic Clonal Interference

17

which can be very unwieldy. However, in the simple case treating the advan-
tageous mutant and the wild type only, and where the only eﬀect of deleteri-
ous mutations is to revert the advantageous mutant back to wild type, one-
dimensional diﬀusion theory, as developed by Kimura (1962); Kimura and
Ohta (1969), is still applicable, and gives satisfying results (van Nimwegen
et al., 1999; Wilke et al., 2001).

The main quantities in diﬀusion theory are the mean Mδx and the variance
Vδx in the rate of change per generation of the concentration x of the invading
mutant. The derivation of these quantities is straightforward (Ewens, 1979),
and we ﬁnd

Mδx = γx(1 − x) ,
Vδx = x(1 − x)/N

(A.1)
(A.2)

to ﬁrst order in 1/N and γ. Here, γ is the relative diﬀerence in mean ﬁtness
between a wild-type population and a population with ﬁxed advantageous
mutant. The only diﬀerence between these expressions and those of Kimura
(1962) is that γ replaces the selective advantage s in Mδx. Without mutations
(u = 0), γ is equal to s, and we recover the standard results. For positive u,
γ has the form

(1 + s)(1 − u) − 1 for u < s/(1 + s),
for u ≥ s/(1 + s).

0

γ =

(cid:26)

(A.3)

The mutation rate uc at which γ reaches 0, uc = s/(1 + s), corresponds to
the error threshold of quasispecies theory (Swetina and Schuster, 1982; Eigen
et al., 1988, 1989). For mutation rates larger than uc, the invading mutant does
not have an advantage over the wild type, and the ﬁxation process corresponds
to that of a neutral mutant.

The probability of ﬁxation follows now from Kimura (1962) as

P (s, u) =

1 − e−2γ
1 − e−2γN .

Likewise, the expected time to ﬁxation follows from Kimura and Ohta (1969)
as

A.2 Branching process theory

According to Barton (1995), the probability that a beneﬁcial mutation reaches
ﬁxation in a genotype with genetic background i follows from iterating the
following set of equations:

∞

(1 − Pi,t−1) =

Wi,j (1 − P

∗
i,t)j ,

j=0
X
where Pi,t is the probability of ﬁxation of an allele that is present in a single
copy in site i in generation t, Wi,j denotes the probability that an allele in
site i contributes with j oﬀsprings to the next generation, and

P

∗
i,t =

Mi,kPk,t

Xk
is the probability that an allele in background i at time t − 1 would be ﬁxed,
given that at time t it is passed to one oﬀspring. The quantity Mj,k gives
the probability that an oﬀspring from a parent at background i will be at
background k. If the distribution of oﬀspring is given by a Poisson distribution
with mean (1 + si), i.e.,

(A.8)

(A.9)

Wi,j =

(1 + si)j
j!

−(1+si),

e

(A.10)

then Eq. (A.8) becomes

∗
i,t

.

(cid:3)

(1 − Pi,t−1) = exp

−(1 + si)P

(A.11)

(cid:2)

The ﬁxation probabilities correspond to the solution of Eq. (A.8) obtained in
the limit t → ∞.

In our model, we consider only two distinct classes of genotypes, and mu-
tations occur only from advantageous mutant to wild type. Because the wild
type has a mean number of oﬀspring per generation exactly equal to 1, the
probability of ﬁxation of wild type sequences in the branching-process formu-
lation vanishes (Harris, 1963). Therefore, the probability of ﬁxation P (s, u) is
given by the solution of the equation:

P (s, u) = 1 − exp [−(1 + s)(1 − u)P (s, u)] .

(A.12)

Unfortunately, it is not possible to derive a closed-form solution to this equa-
tion. P (s, u) has to be determined numerically from iterating Eq. (A.12).

Since the relevant parameter seems to be γ = (1 + s)(1 − u) − 1, the above

equation can be written as

P (s, u) = 1 − exp [−(γ + 1)P (s, u)] .

(A.13)

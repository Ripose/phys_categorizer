There have been various works in which similarities
between the dynamics of proteins and the structure and
dynamics of glasses and spin glasses have been discussed
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Although the energy landscapes in the two
systems may be quite diﬀerent, non-exponential relax-
ation is observed in both.
In glasses, relaxation often
follows the stretched exponential form characteristic of
the “Kohlrausch law:”

Φ(t) = Φ0 exp[−(t/τ )β], 0 < β < 1,

where τ is a temperature-dependent characteristic time

observed to follow, over 10 orders of magnitude, a Vogel-
Fulcher law [5], τ ∝ exp[A/(T − T0)]

Now, any reasonable relaxation function Φ(t) can be ﬁt
by assuming some distribution w(τ ) of relaxation times
among additive contributions to the relaxing quantity,
thus

Φ(t) =

dτ w(τ ) exp(−t/τ ).

This extends the idea of conventional Debye relaxation
with a single relaxation time to a situation in which there
is a distribution of degrees of freedom each contributing
independently to Φ(t) with its own relaxation time - thus
parallel relaxation.

A diﬀerent point of view was proposed by Palmer,
Stein, Abrahams, and Anderson [6]. They pointed out
that the conventional parallel picture, while simple, is
often microscopically arbitrary and that a more physi-
cal view is that the path to equilibrium is governed by
many sequential correlated steps - thus a series inter-
pretation in which there are strong correlations between
diﬀerent degrees of freedom. These authors proposed [6]
a microscopically motivated model of hierarchically con-
strained dynamics (HCD) which leads to the Kohlrausch
law (and a maximal relaxation time of the Vogel-Fulcher
form). That result was cited by Shibata, Kurata, and
Kushida [4] to argue that HCD holds in their observation
of stretched exponential relaxation in an experiment on
conformational dynamics in Zn-substituted myoglobin.
Of course it is possible, and sometimes likely, that both
parallel and sequential processes exist in the same sys-
tem.

FIG. 1: Experimental relaxation in MbCO [3]

In a discussion of anomalous relaxation in proteins,
Iben et al [3] presented data on carbonmonoxymyoglobin
(MbCO). This is myoglobin in which CO is bound to the
central iron atom of the heme group. In this system, par-
allel relaxation processes also occur; they dominate the
dynamics of the rebinding of the ligand after photodisso-
ciation [7]. Here we focus on the pressure release relax-
ation experiments of Iben et al.
[3] Infrared absorption
spectra of the stretch bands of the CO were taken under
various conditions. After pressure release, the center fre-
quency of the A0 band initially shifts rapidly upward by
0.4 cm−1 and then relaxes slowly toward its low-pressure
equilibrium value, 1.2 cm−1 higher. This behavior at var-
ious temperatures is shown in Fig. 3 of Ref. 1 and it is
replotted here (without the error bars) as Fig. 1. It seen
that the relaxation is close to power law over more than
three decades of time, thus much slower than exponen-
tial, or even stretched exponential.

It is of interest to ask whether there is a model of hi-
erarchically constrained dynamics as proposed in Ref. 4
which can account for the main features of Fig. 1. These
are: a) At each temperature there is a region of power-law
relaxation which crosses over at shorter times to some-
thing much slower. b) This crossover time increases as
temperature decreases. c) The power law is the same at
each temperature, but there is an increasing oﬀset as the
temperature is lowered.

In what follows, it will be shown that one of the mod-
els mentioned in Ref. 4 in fact gives behavior identical to
what was observed in MbCO. For HCD, one recognizes
that equilibrium distributions in conﬁguration space are
not relevant since the free energy barriers which deter-
mine relaxation are continuously changing in time as dif-
ferent degrees of freedom relax at diﬀerent rates. Fur-
thermore, in a strongly correlated system one expects
that with any choice of coordinates, interactions will re-
main in the form of constraints and that these will be of
importance over a range of time scales. The nature of
constraints is that some degrees of freedom cannot relax
until their motion is made possible by the relaxation of
other degrees of freedom. These restrictions occur over
a wide hierarchy of coordinates, from fast ones to slow
ones. A complete discussion of this HCD approach is
given in Ref. 4.

To implement this picture, Palmer et al.

[6] set up a
hierarchy of levels n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .. The degrees of free-
dom in level n are represented by Nn Ising pseudospins
(two-level centers) each of which has two possible states.
This was adapted from earlier work of Stein [2]. Con-
straints enter via the requirement that each “spin” in
level n + 1 is free to change its state only if a condition
on some number µn of spins in level n is satisﬁed. Now,
the µn spins have 2µn states. Let the required condition
be that just one of these possible states is realized. If the
average relaxation time in level n is τn, then on average,
it will take a time 2µn τn for a spin in level n+1 to change
its state. Therefore

τn = τ0

exp(µi ln 2) = τ0 exp Un,

(3)

n−1

Y0

where

Un =

µi ln 2.

(4)

The relaxation function is given as a sum of the correla-
tion functions of all the degrees of freedom Si:

n−1

X0

N

Xi=1

2

(8)

(9)

where wn = Nn/N is the fraction of the total number of
degrees of freedom which are in level n. [8]

For a given model, wn and µn must be speciﬁed. As
remarked in Ref. 4, the simple choices µn = µ0/ ln 2, a
constant and wn = wn−1/λ give power-law relaxation.
Here, this situation is examined more fully.

The sum in Eq. (6) is rewritten as an integral using

the above choices for w and µ:

Φ(t) = w0 Z

dnλ

−n exp[(−t/τ0)e

−nµ0 ],

(7)

where from normalization at t = 0, w0 = ln λ. This
integral is evaluated exactly in terms of the incomplete
gamma function

γ(ν, u) =

dx xν−1e

−x.

The result is

Φ(t) = ν

γ(ν, t/τ0),

u

t (cid:17)

(cid:16)

where ν ≡ ln λ/µ0. For large values of its second ar-
gument, γ(ν, u) approaches the complete gamma func-
tion Γ(ν). Thus, at large times Φ(t) ∝ t−ν , as observed
[3]. For small u, γ(ν, u) ≈ uν/ν − uν+1/(ν + 1) + . . .,
so that for short times, Φ(t) crosses over to a slower
1 − const(t/τ0) dependence. Temperature dependence
is introduced in the model through the temperature de-
pendence of the fundamental relaxation time τ0(T ); its
inverse corresponds to the rate constant kr(T ) introduced
in Ref. 1. Thus the behavior of Eq. (9) is similar to the
form

Φ(t) = [1 + kr(T ) t ]

−ν

(10)

which was used in Fig. 3 of Ref. 1 to ﬁt the data.

The appearance of the experimental points at diﬀerent
temperatures, in particular that the data are parallel (the
same power law for all T ) at long times, suggests that a
scaling function could describe the experimental results.
A general form is

Φ(t) = (1/N )

hSi(0)Si(t)i.

(5)

Φ(t, T ) ∝ T αG[t/τ0(T )],

(11)

In a correlated system, the dynamics of the Si are not in-
dependent, so each of the correlation functions in Eq. (5)
depends on the behavior of the other S’s. As described
above, the HCD scheme of Palmer et al. [6] incorporates
correlations. The Si are arranged in a hierarchy of levels
n with each level having its characteristic relaxation time
τn given by Eq. (3). So Eq. (5) may be rewritten as a
sum over the diﬀerent levels from 0 to ∞:

Φ(t) =

wn exp(−t/τn),

(6)

∞

Xn=0

Therefore, by rescaling the time by a parameter τ0(T )
for each temperature the data for Φ(t, T )/T α would all
fall on a single curve. The fact that the power law of
the long time behavior is independent of T implies that
the exponent α = 0. If this rescaling is carried out, the
temperature dependence of the characteristic rescaling
time τ0(T ) may be determined. This rescaling for the
data of Iben et al [3] is shown in Fig. 2a.

If in addition one has a theoretical expression which
has a scaling form, such as Eq. (9), then by collapsing the
data onto the theoretical curve, one obtains the numerical
values of τ0(T ). This is carried out for the hierarchical

3 to 5 or so. The number λ measures the geometric re-
duction of the fraction of spins which belong to level n
as n increases through slower and slower levels. Φ(t) has
only a logarithmic dependence on λ so it is reasonable to
take ln λ to be of order unity. This gives ν = ln λ/µ0 <
∼ 1.
The ﬁt value is ν = 0.28, i.e. slightly less than four spins,
on average, combine to unfreeze the degrees of freedom
at the next level. This seems quite reasonable.

Eq. (10), taken from Eq. (1) of Ref. 1 is consistent
with the present Eq. (9) in that they agree in the lim-
its of small and large t/τ0. Therefore the ﬁt by Iben et
al. [3] using Eq. (10) is also satisfactory. However, there
is no physical motivation for that form whereas in the
present work the observed non-exponential relaxation in
MbCO is derived from a microscopic model which incor-
porates strong-correlation constraints on the relaxation
of the molecule in a deﬁnite way.

What conclusions can be drawn from the present anal-
ysis? The scenario that the model describes is one in
which the primary relaxation event represents the rate
1/τ0(T ) at which a typical enthalpy barrier is over-
come. Since no further T -dependence is introduced, the
conclusion is that all subsequent relaxation events are
“slaved”[11] to the primary one and that they represent
entropic conformational changes of the molecule.

A Los Alamos group has independently been analyzing
the relaxation processes in MbCO. [11, 12] Remarkably,
they have reached conclusions which are consistent with
the present hierarchical model for the relaxation of the
CO vibration frequency. Namely, they argue that the
temperature dependence of the relaxation is governed by
an activation enthalpy for which the solvent is respon-
sible. This determines the rate of the fastest relaxation
process - 1/τ0(T ) in the hierarchical model. Subsequent
relaxations involve degrees of freedom of the protein and
the hydration shell and are governed by entropy barri-
ers; they have the same temperature dependence as the

model of Eq. (9) in Fig. 2b. The value of ν in Eq. (9) is
adjusted to agree with the common large t slope as seen
in Fig. 2a. The black curve in Fig. 2b is Eq. (9) with ν
set equal to 0.28. The values of τ0 for each of the four
temperatures are plotted in Fig. 3, where the solid curve
is a ﬁt using the expression

1/τ0(T ) = k0 exp[−(T0/T )2]
(12)
The result is k0 = 1.5 × 1016 5s−1, T0 = 1105 K.[10]
With only four points, a number of diﬀerent functional
forms might seem equally good. In particular, an Arrhe-
nius form works almost as well, but has an unacceptably
large pre-exponential factor.
[11] The form chosen has
been suggested by several authors [3, 9]; it can describe
diﬀusion in a random potential of a form which mimics
the potential surface of a protein.

As discussed in Ref. 1, the observed relaxation process
most likely involves substates having diﬀerent conforma-
tional molecular structures as well as diﬀerent angles of
the CO ligand with respect to the heme normal. With
this in mind, contact may be made between the parame-
ters of the above model and the actual experiment. Re-
call that µ0 measures the number of “spins” in a given
level which must arrive at a certain conﬁguration before
a typical spin in the next level becomes unfrozen and can
relax. The physical picture of constrained movement of
atoms which underlies the model and its application to
MbCO then implies that this number should be around

solvent ﬂuctuation rate and are slower. This descrip-
tion is precisely the same as that of the hierarchical
model presented here. The physically motivated scenario
of the successful hierarchical approach lends support to
the identiﬁcation of the physical relaxation processes de-
scribed in Ref. 11.

The analysis presented here can be generalized to more
complicated situations. For example, the hierarchical
rules could be modiﬁed to include simultaneous paral-
lel relaxation (“unslaved”) processes as in the ligand re-
binding referred to earlier , internal enthalpic barriers,
reverse constraints, and intra-level correlations. While
other forms than Eq. (9) might ﬁt the MbCO data, within
the hierarchical scenario the fact that the long time be-
havior is a scalable power law practically forces the simple
rules which were used to obtain Eq. (9). The success of
this approach suggests that a similar picture and analysis
can be relevant for other dynamical processes in biolog-
ical molecules. If so, insight can be obtained about the
physical processes which determine the relaxation phe-
nomena.

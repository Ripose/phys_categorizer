A new type of spatial-temporal correlation in the process approaching to the self-organized
criticality is investigated for the two simple models for biological evolution. The change behaviors
of the position with minimum barrier are shown to be quantitatively diﬀerent in the two models.
Diﬀerent results of the correlation are given for the two models. We argue that the correlation can
be used, together with the power-law distributions, as criteria for self-organized criticality.

The phenomenon of “self-organized criticality” (SOC), with potential applications ranging from the behavior of
sandpile and the description of the growth of surfaces to generic description of biological evolution, has become
as a topic of considerable interest [1–8]. It is observed that the dynamics of complex systems in nature does not
follow a smooth, gradual path, instead it often occurs in terms of punctuations, or “avalanches” in other word. The
appearance of the spatial-temporal complexity in nature, containing information over a wide range of length and time
scale, presents a fascinating but longstanding puzzle. Such complexity also shows up in simple mathematical models
for biological evolution and growth phenomena far from equilibrium. In former studies, power-law distributions for
the spatial size and lifetime of the “avalanches” have been observed in various complex systems and are regarded as
“ﬁngerprints” for SOC. It seems that there is no general agreement on a suitable deﬁnition of SOC [9,10], although
a minimal deﬁnition was given in [11]. Because there is no universally accepted “black-box” tests for the presence or
absence of SOC based solely on observables, systems with a wide range of characteristics have all been designated as
“self-organized critical”.

While numerous numerical studies have claimed SOC to occur in speciﬁc models, and although the transition to
the SOC state was studied in [12–14], a question has never been answered: How is the process approaching to the
ﬁnal dynamical SOC attractor characterized? One may even ask whether the phenomenon SOC can be adequately
characterized by such power-law distributions. The answer to the latter question seems to be negative, as concluded
in [15].
In Ref. [15] were pointed out “some striking observable diﬀerences between two ‘self-organized critical’
models which have a remarkable structural similarity”. The two models, as called the Bak-Sneppen (B-S) models,
are introduced in [16–18] and are used to mimic biological evolution. The models involve a one-dimensional random
array on L sites. Each site represents a species in the “food-chain”. The random number (or barrier) assigned to
each site is a measure of the “survivability” of the species. Initially, the random number for each species is drawn
uniformly from the interval (0, 1). In each update, the least survivable species (the update center) and some others
undergo mutations and obtain new random numbers which are also drawn uniformly from (0, 1). In the ﬁrst version
of the model (the local or nearest-neighbor model), only the update center and its two nearest neighbors participate
the mutations.
In the second version, K − 1 other sites chosen randomly besides the update center are involved
in the update and assigned new random survivabilities (so this version is called random neighbor model). Periodic
boundary conditions are adopted in the ﬁrst model. As shown in [18–20], the second version is analytically solvable.
Investigation in [15] shows that some behaviors of the local and random neighbor models are qualitatively identical.
They both have a nontrivial distribution of barrier heights of minimum barriers, and each has a power-law avalanche
distribution. But the spatial and temporal correlations between the minimum barriers show diﬀerent behaviors in the
two models and thus can be used to distinguish them.

In all the studies mentioned above, spatial and/or temporal distributions of the “avalanches” and correlations
between positions with minimum of barriers are investigated separately. As shown in many studies, however, spatial
and/or temporal distribution of the “avalanches” alone cannot be used as a criterion for SOC, nor can the spatial or
temporal correlation do. In this paper, it is attempted to study a new kind of correlation between minimum barriers
in the process of the updating in the two models for biological evolution. The correlation between the positions with
minimum barriers at time (or update) s and s + 1 is investigated. Since the new correlation involves two sites at
diﬀerent times, it is of spatial-temporal type. Thus it may be suitable for the study of spatial-temporal complexity.
Consider the update process of the local neighbor model. Initially, each site is assigned a random number. All the
random numbers are drawn uniformly from interval (0,1). Denote X(s) the site number with minimum barrier after
s updates. The sites can be numbered such that 1 ≤ X(s) ≤ L. To see how X(s) changes in updating process in
the model X(s) is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of s for an arbitrary update process for lattice size L=200 with s
from 1 to 2000. The lower part of Fig. 1 is a zoomed part of the upper one for small s. It is clear that X(s) seems

1

to be random when s is small. With the going-on of updating, X(s) becomes more and more likely to be in the
neighborhood of last update center, X(s − 1). So there appear some plateau like parts in Fig. 1. In other word, there
appears some correlation between X(s) when the system is self-organized to approach the critical state. So, it may
be fruitful to study the self-correlation of X(s) in searching quantities characterizing the process to SOC. For this
purpose, one can deﬁne a quantity

C(s) = hX(s)X(s + 1)i − hX(s)ihX(s + 1)i

,

(1)

with average over diﬀerent events of updating. Obviously, if there is no correlation between the sites with minimum
barrier at time s and s + 1, or hX(s)X(s + 1)i = hX(s)ihX(s + 1)i, C(s) will be zero. Thus, C(s) can show whether
there is correlation between X(s) and also give a measure of the strength of the correlation. Because of the randomness
of the survivability at each site, X(s) can be 1, 2, · · ·, L with equal probability, 1/L. Thus, hX(s)i = (L + 1)/2 for
every time s. It should be pointed out that hX(s)i = (L + 1)/2 does not mean any privilege of sites with numbering
about (L+1)/2. In fact, all sites can be the update center with equal chance at time s if the update process is repeated
many times from the initial state. Due to the randomness of the updated survivability X(s + 1) can also take any
integer from 1 to L. However, the distribution of X(s + 1) is peaked at X(s) when s is large, see [13] for detail.
With the update going on, the width of the distribution becomes more and more narrower. When the width becomes
narrow enough, hX(s)X(s + 1)i will turn out to be hX 2(s)i = (2L2 + 3L + 1)/6. So, C(s) will approach (L2 − 1)/12
for large s. In above deﬁnition for C(s), however, the neighboring relation between X(s) and X(s + 1) cannot be
realized once the numbering for the sites is given. Due to the periodic boundary conditions adopted in the model, one
of the nearest neighbors of the site with numbering 1 is the one numbered L. To overcome this shortcoming, one can
introduce an orientational shorter distance ∆(s) between X(s) and X(s + 1). Imagine the L sites with numbering
1, 2, · · · , L are placed on a circle in clockwise order. Then |∆(s)| is the shorter distance between the two sites on the
circle. If X(s + 1) is reached along the shorter curve from X(s) in clockwise direction, ∆(s) is positive. Otherwise
∆(s) is negative. For deﬁniteness, one can assume −L/2 ≤ ∆(s) < L/2. With ∆(s), one can use

X ′(s + 1) = X(s) + ∆(s)

(2)

in place of X(s + 1) in the deﬁnition of C(s). Since X ′(s) can cross the (non-existing) boundary between 1 and L and
reﬂect the neighboring relation with X(s), the eﬀect of periodic boundary conditions on the correlation can be taken
into account. (In the simulation of the B-S model numbering the L sites with integer numbers 1, 2, · · · , L is necessary,
but the start position can be arbitrary. Diﬀerent numbering scheme will give the same results for C(s), as physically
demanded. This in return is also an indication of the equivalence of all sites in the presence of periodic boundary
conditions.) To normalize the dependence of C(s) on the size of the one-dimensional array, we can renormalize C(s)
by (L2 − 1)/12. In the following, we use a normalized deﬁnition of C(s) as

C(s) =

hX(s)X ′(s + 1)i − hX(s)ihX ′(s + 1)i

(L2 − 1)/12

.

(3)

In current study X(s) and ∆(s) are determined from Monte Carlo simulations, and 500,000 simulation events are
used to determine the averages involved. For each event, 2000 updates are performed from an initial state with
random barriers on the sites uniformly distributed in (0, 1). The normalized correlation function C(s) is shown as a
function of s in Fig. 2 for L = 50, 100, and 200. One can see that C(s) is a monotonously increasing function of
time s. As in our naive consideration, C(s) is very small in the early stage of updates and becomes larger and larger
for larger s, indicating the increase of the strength of correlation between the sites with minimum barrier at diﬀerent
times. The behavior of C(s) with s exhibits diﬀerent characteristics for small and large s. C(s) increases with s very
quickly for small s, but the rate becomes quite slow after a knee point. The knee point appears earlier for smaller L,
showing the existence of a ﬁnite-size eﬀect. Also, the seemly saturating value of C(s) depends on the size L of the
lattice, or more clearly, it increases with the lattice size L. Since only 500,000 simulation events are used in current
study, there shows the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations in the ﬁgure.

The correlation between X(s) can be investigated for the random neighbor model for biological evolution in the
same way. For simplicity only the case with K = 3 is taken into account. The generalization to other cases is straight
forward. First, one can have a look on how X(s) changes with update. X(s) is shown as a function of s in the upper
part of Fig. 3. This plot may look as a random scatter of points at ﬁrst sight. But it is not. A close look reveals
correlations: X(s) often has almost same value for several consecutive or almost consecutive s values. However, no
obvious plateau like part can be seen in the ﬁgure, showing the diﬀerence between the two versions of B-S model.
C(s) is also studied and shown in the lower part of Fig. 3 as a function of s for the lattice size L = 200. In the random
neighbor version of the B-S model, sites numbered with 1 and L are no longer neighbors. So, in the calculation of
C(s) from Eq. (3), X(s + 1) is used instead of X ′(s + 1). The counterpart for the nearest neighbor model is also

2

drawn in the ﬁgure for comparison. One can see that the saturating value is much smaller than in the case of the
local neighbor version of the model.

From the discussions above one can see that the correlation between the sites with minimum barrier may play an
important role in investigating SOC. The power-law distributions for the size and lifetime of the “avalanches” together
with the new kind of correlation may be used as criteria for SOC.

ABSTRACT

We give an explicit formula for the membrane potential of cells in terms of the intracellular
and extracellular ionic concentrations, and derive equations for the ionic currents that ﬂow through
channels, exchangers and electrogenic pumps based on simple energy considerations and conservation
laws. We demonstrate that the work done by the pump is equal to the potential energy of the cell
plus the energy loss due to the downhill ionic ﬂuxes through the channels and the exchanger.
Our equations predict osmotic pressure variations. The theory is illustrated in a simple model
of spontaneously active cells in the cardiac pacemaker. The simulated action potential and the
ﬁve currents in the model are in excellent agreement with experiments. The model predicts the
experimental observed intracellular ionic concentration of potassium, calcium and sodium. We do
not see any drift of the values for the concentrations in a long time simulation, instead we can obtain
the same asymptotic values starting with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ionic models of the cellular membrane potential are typically guided by extensive data sets from voltage clamp
experiments. The purpose of this paper is not to introduce a new ionic model incorporating the many experimentally
observed currents (Boyett, 1996), or to critically review other models, but merely to give an alternative formulation
based on simple principles from classical physics. Instead of trying to reproduce observed voltage clamp data and
tail currents of activation, deactivation and inactivation, we demonstrate that simple energy considerations and
conservation laws can be useful when formulating a model.

We derive equations for ionic currents ﬂowing through channels, exchangers and electrogenic pumps. These are
based on the Boltzmann distribution law (Boltzmann, 1868), which states that a particle in thermal equilibrium spends
less time in states of higher energy than in states of lower energy, the Markov assumption (Markov, 1906) which says
that the transition probabilities to the next state of a stochastic system is only dependent on its present state, and
the principle of detailed balance (Onsager, 1931) which says that the microscopic laws of physics are invariant with
respect to the reversal of time. Our equations were inspired by Ehrenstein and Lecar’s model of channel gating (1977),
Mullins’ model of the Na+, Ca2+ exchanger (1977), and Chapman’s model of the Na+, K+ pump (1978).

Since the intracellular ionic concentrations are treated as dynamical variables, we show that the standard diﬀerential
equation for the membrane potential can be replaced with a new algebraic equation. We demonstrate that the
pump generates a transmembrane voltage gradient, a transmembrane pressure gradient, transmembrane concentration
gradients, and downhill ionic ﬂuxes through the exchanger and the channels.

The theory is illustrated with a simple model of spontaneously active cells in the rabbit sinoatrial node. The
observable parameters in the model are based on the experiments of Shibasaki (1987), Hagiwara et al.
(1988),
Muramatsu et al.
(1996). The non–observable parameters in the model are determined
numerically, in the same way as in an earlier study (Endresen, 1997a), by comparing the action potentials generated
by the model with the action potentials recorded by Baruscotti et al. (1996).

(1996) and Sakai et al.

There are two basic principles behind the average motion of particles. The ﬁrst is diﬀusion which is general; the
second applies only to charged particles such as ions in solutions. Simple diﬀusion is described by the empirical law
of Fick:

~φ = −ukT ∇[S] ,

~φ = −zeu[S]∇v ,

where φ is the ionic ﬂux, [S] the concentration of ions and u the ratio of the velocity to the force acting on a particle,
known as the mobility. The empirical law of Ohm describes the net motion of charged particles in an electric ﬁeld:

where z is the valence, e the elementary charge and v the potential. Since we assume that the temperature is constant,
we can neglect the thermal ﬂux given by Fourier’s empirical law. The fact that the mobility in Fick’s law must be
identical to the mobility in Ohm’s law was ﬁrst noticed by Einstein (1905). If we combine equations (1) and (2), the
total ﬂux of ions due to diﬀusion and electric forces becomes:

The equilibrium potential where the ﬂux is zero can be found by integrating equation (3) from the intracellular (i) to
the extracellular (e) side of the membrane:

(cid:17)i

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

h

where [S]i and [S]e refer to the intracellular and extracellular concentrations. This equation, ﬁrst stated by Nernst
(1888) is based only on the empirical laws of Ohm and Fick and the relation of Einstein.

The same formula can be derived in a more general way using the Boltzmann factor (Boltzmann, 1868). The

relative probability at equilibrium that an ion is at the intracellular or extracellular side of a cell membrane is

where ∆w is the energy diﬀerence between these intra– and extracellular states , T is the absolute temperature
and k is Boltzmann’s constant. If we consider ions of valence z the energy diﬀerence between the intracellular and
extracellular side can be written:

This together with equation (5) yields equation (4). The equilibrium potentials for the predominant cellular cations
are then:

We assume that ionic channels are either completely open or completely closed and randomly ﬂuctuate between
these states. Each channel is here assumed to be a simple Markov process (Markov, 1906), described by ﬁrst order
kinetics::

where the rate constants α and β are functions of transmembrane voltage and control the transitions between the
closed (C) and the open (O) states of the channel. The rate for a closed channel to open is α, and β is the rate for an
open channel to close. Let x denote the average fraction of channels that are open, or, equivalently, the probability

that a given channel will be open. We may say that the ionic ﬂux through an ensemble of channels is regulated by a
sliding door whose position is x. This yields:

Here x∞ denotes the steady state fraction of open channels and τ the relaxation time. Let us assume that the energy
diﬀerence between the closed and open positions is given by

where q is an gating charge, usually q ≈ 4e, the term qvx is due to the diﬀerence in mechanical conformational energy
between the two states and qv represents the change in electrical potential energy due to the redistribution of charge
during the transition. At equilibrium, dx/dt = 0, and the ratio of the probabilities for a single channel to be in the
open state or the closed state is,

This relation is known as the principle of detailed balance (Onsager, 1931). The same ratio is given by the Boltzmann
distribution (Boltzmann, 1868),

Thus, from equations (14), (15) and (16):

Therefore, making the ad hoc assumption that the product of forward and backward reaction rates is constant, the

2. Calcium and sodium channels

The calcium and sodium channels also have an inactivation mechanism in addition to the above activation mechanism.
We can view these mechanisms as two independent Markov processes, or equivalently two independent sliding doors,
which are both aﬀected by voltage. An ion can only go through if both sliding doors are at least slightly open. The
activation mechanism is very fast, so we use the steady state fraction of open channels (equation (18)) for this. The
maximum time constant of inactivation for calcium and sodium channels are of the same order of magnitude as the
maximum time constant of the activation of the potassium channel, thus:

where gCa and gNa are the conductances of the calcium and sodium currents respectively, vCa and vNa are given by
equations (8) and (9), vd and vm are the half–activation potentials, and vf and vh are the half–inactivation potentials.

C. Na+, K+ Pump

The Na,K–ATPase is found in the plasma membrane of virtually all animal cells and is responsible for active
transport of sodium and potassium. Low sodium concentration and high potassium concentration in the cytosol are
essential for basic cellular functions such as excitability, secondary active transport, and volume regulation. In our
model, the Na+, K+ pump is the only energy source. We shall assume that the following equation is a complete
macroscopic description of the pump reaction (Chapman, 1978):

ATP + 3Na+

i + 2K+
e

ADP + Pio + 3Na+

e + 2K+
i

,

α
⇀↽
β

(26)

where ATP, ADP and Pio are adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosophate and inorganic phosphate, while α and
β are the rates of the forward and backward reactions. The energy involved in the movement of 3 Na+ and 2 K+ ions
against their electrochemical gradients is:

4

where vK and vNa are given by equations (7) and (9). This result is independant of the detailed interaction between
ions, molecules and the ATPase enzyme. Therefore, the total work done in reaction (26) is:

∆wNa = −3e(v − vNa)
∆wK = +2e(v − vK) ,

∆w = ∆wATP + ∆wNa + ∆wK

= ∆wATP + e(3vNa − 2vK − v) ,

where ∆wATP is the energy associated with the breakdown of ATP. The ratio of α to β is again given by equations
(15) and (16). The energy available from ATP breakdown is much larger than the energy required to translocate
the potassium and sodium ions at small negative membrane potentials. In practice, such a pump or motorized swing
door will soon reach saturation. We therefore choose the rate of the forward reaction to be constant, resembling the
maximum possible speed of the swing door in that direction, and obtain:

α = λ

β = λ exp

∆wATP + e(3vNa − 2vK − v)
kT

,

(cid:20)
where λ is a constant. The net pump current for a cell with M pumps can then be written:

iNaK = eM (α − β) = kNaK

1 − exp

−v − 2vK + 3vNa + vATP

where kNaK = eλM , and vATP = ∆wATP/e.

To maintain a steady state for the intracellular calcium concentration in for example heart cells, the amount of
calcium that enters the cell via ionic channels must be extruded. The Na+, Ca2+ exchanger is the major mechanism
responsible for achieving a balance between calcium entry and extrusion in oscillating cells. We assume that the rates
of the exchange reaction (Mullins, 1977) given by:

are governed largely by the electrochemical gradients for sodium and calcium, together with the membrane potential.
In other words, the energy produced when 3 extracellular sodium ions take the elevator down into the cytosol is used
to elevate one calcium ion up from the cytosol into the extracellular space:

where vCa and vNa are given by equations (8) and (9). The total work done in reaction (33) is:

∆w = ∆wNa + ∆wCa = e(v − 3vNa + 2vCa) .

The ratio of α to β in equation (33) is given by equations (15) and (16). Since ∆w = e(v − 3vNa + 2vCa) in a cell
usually oscillates around zero, the most natural choice of α and β is:

E. Membrane Voltage

We assume that the electrical activity of a cell is described by the ﬁve currents discussed above, and that all the
other currents (Boyett, 1996) are of minor importance. The standard diﬀerential equation for the voltage, and the
conservation laws for intracellular ionic concentrations are then:

where C is cell capacitance, F is Faraday’s constant and we assume that the cell volume V is constant. Solving
equation (41) for iK, equation (42) for iCa, and equation (43) for iNa, we obtain:

Inserting this into equation (40) we obtain:

since all of the currents cancel. This equation can also be written as:

Integrating gives:

gives:

where the integration constant c has to be determined. Given that the voltage across a capacitor is zero when the net
charge diﬀerence is zero, choosing the integration constant as:

v =

so that the voltage is zero when there is no charge gradient. Equation (51) is simply the relation between the electric
potential and charge of a capacitor, which is in fact the origin of equation (40). Thus it is completely general and
independent of the number of membrane currents in a model. The meaning of equation (51) is:

The voltage across the membrane of a cell is caused by, and is directly proportional to, the surplus of charge
inside the cell,

but it is only valid if we assume that the intracellular concentration of anions is equal to the extracellular concentration
of anions. Since the cations are balanced by the anions in any solution, the intracellular/extracellular concentration
of anions must be close to the intracellular/extracellular concentration of cations.

Since equation (51) is the explicit integral of equation (40), it should be used instead of equation (40) (or the equiv-
alent of equation (40)) in any model. The diﬀerential equation (40) is needed only in models where the intracellular
ionic concentrations are not tracked individually (for example, the Hodgkin–Huxley equations (1952)).

There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between equations (40) and (51). Here is an analogy: There are two diﬀerent ways to
calculate how many ions are inside a cell. The ﬁrst method counts every ion enetering or leaving (equation (40)), while
the second method simultaneously counts all the ions inside the cell, perhaps by means of an ion detector (equation
(51)). Both methods will correctly give the variation in the number of ions in the cell. However, the observer of ions
entering and leaving will only observe variations in the number of ions. If he wants to know the actual number of
ions in the cell, he must make an initial guess of the number of ions already inside. Because his guess may diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from the actual ion number (as maesured by the ion detector) indicates, the results from the two methods
may be contradictory.

F. Osmotic Pressure

In this section we demonstrate that variations in the osmotic pressure are a natural consequence of our model. In
fact, van’t Hoﬀ’s equation for the osmotic pressure can be derived by tracking the ﬂow of energy under the assumption
of constant temperature and volume.

From elementary physics the work W done by a force F to move an object from X = A to X = B is given by:

W =

If we take into account the reversal potentials in our model this can be written:

W =

iK(v − vK) + iCa(v − vCa) + iNa(v − vNa)

+ iNaCa(v − 3vNa + 2vCa) + iNaK(v + 2vK − 3vNa)dt .

Using equations (40), (44), (45) and (46) the currents cancel and we obtain:

When solving these integrals it is important to remember that the reversal potentials vK, vCa and vNa given by
equations (7), (8) and (9), are dependent on the integration variables [K]i, [Ca]i and [Na]i. Using:

the integral becomes:

This is the total work associated with the currents. The pump work and work due to the exchanger and channel
currents have opposite signs since the pump moves ions against their electrochemical gradients, while energy is lost
by the downhill ionic ﬂuxes through the exchanger and the channels. Since energy cannot be created or destroyed,
we deﬁne the potential energy P of the cell so that the total energy E is zero (this is the most common deﬁnition of
potential energy):

The ﬁrst term is the electrical potential energy of a capacitor, the second term is the potential energy associated with
the concentration gradients, and the third term is the potential energy associated with an osmotic pressure gradient
(caused by the concentration gradients). Rewriting equation (58):

we see that the pump (equation (60)) produces:

1. a transmembrane voltage gradient (equation (61)),

2. a transmembrane concentration gradient (equation (62)),

3. a transmembrane pressure gradient (equation (63)), and

(58)

(59)

(60)

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

4. downhill ﬂuxes through the exchanger and the channels (equation (64)).

In 1886 van’t Hoﬀ noticed that the behaviour of solutes in dilute solutions resembles the behaviour of a perfect gas:

The pressure which a gas exerts when a given number of molecules are distributed in a given volume is equally great as

the osmotic pressure, which under the same conditions would be produced my most solutes when they are dissolved in an
arbitrary solvent.

Therefore we can use the ideal gas law p = [S]RT to calulate the osmotic pressure across the cell membrane:

π = RT {[K]i − [K]e + [Na]i − [Na]e + [Ca]i − [Ca]e} .

(65)

This is the van’t Hoﬀ equation for the osmotic pressure (π) across a solute impermeable barrier separating two ideal
dilute solutions. This is nothing but equation (63) divided by the cell volume V .

Since we did not have the osmotic pressure in mind when we made the theory, our theory is a perfect example of

one of Richard P. Feynman’s astute observations:

When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it
ﬁts, that those things it ﬁts are not just the things that gave you the idea of the theory; but that the ﬁnished theory makes

something else come out right, in addition.

Our theory indeed has “something else [that] comes out right” – the osmotic pressure variations.

III. MODEL PARAMETERS

A mathematical model of the membrane potential has been derived; equations (7), (8) and (9) represent the
equilibrium potentials, equations (22), (24) and (25) the ionic currents, equations (39) and (32) the exchanger and
the pump currents, equations (41), (42) and (43) the ionic concentrations, equation (51) the membrane voltage, and
ﬁnally, equation (65) the osmotic pressure across the cell membrane. The model has 6 dimensions with the variables
x, f , h, [K]i, [Ca]i and [Na]i.

FIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the simpliﬁed cell model. The three ionic currents of potassium, calcium and sodium, the
exchanger and the pump. The “moveable” gating doors of the ionic channels illustrate that the concentration gradient of
potassium is the opposite to the concentration gradients of calcium and sodium.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the model, with the ionic channels of potassium, calcium and sodium, the
Na+, Ca2+ exchanger and the Na+, K+ pump. The “moveable” gating doors of the ionic channels illustrate that the
concentration gradient of potassium is the opposite of the concentration gradients of calcium and sodium.

On the basis of distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties, cardiac calcium currents have been classiﬁed
into a long lasting type (iCa,L) and a transient type (iCa,T), while cardiac delayed rectiﬁer potassium currents have
been classiﬁed into a rapid type (iKr) and a slow type (iKs). In our model we assume that iCa,T and iKs are of minor
importance; i.e. when we talk about iCa we mean iCa,L, and when we talk about iK we mean iKr.

First, we want to justify the presence of the term kT /2e in equations (22), (24) and (25). This corre-
sponds to a slope factor for the activation and inactivation curves of kT /4e ≈ 6.68 mV at 37◦C. The ob-
served slope factors are 7.4 mV for activation of iK (Shibasaki, 1987), 6.6 mV for activation of iCa (Hagi-
wara et al., 1988), 6.0 mV for inactivation of iCa (Hagiwara et al., 1988), 6.0 mV for activation of iNa (Mu-
ramatsu et al., 1996), and, ﬁnally, 6.4 mV for inactivation of iNa (Muramatsu et al., 1996). Hence, we see
that kT /4e, corresponding to a gating charge of q ≈ 4e,
is an excellent approximation. Now, we would
like to distinguish between the fundamental physical constants (table I), the experimentally observed con-
stants (table II), the adjustable parameters (table III) and the initial conditions (table IV) in the model.

The half–activation and inactivation potentials in the model (vx, vd, vf , vm and vh) are based on the ex-
periments of Shibasaki (1987), Hagiwara et al.
(1996), and we use a value of
vATP that gives a reversal potential for the sodium pump in good agreement with the experiments of Sakai et
al.
(1996). The maximum time constants in these experiments were 203 ms for activation of iK (Shibasaki,
1987), 225 ms for inactivation of iCa (Hagiwara et al., 1988) and 174 ms for inactivation of iNa (Muramatsu et

(1988) and Muramatsu et al.

al., 1996).
In the model, however, we combine these and use a maximum time constant of 200 ms for both τK,
τCa and τNa. Finally, we use typical values for cell volume, cell capacitance, and extracellular ionic concentrations.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

The six diﬀerential equations in the model were solved numerically using a ﬁfth–order Runge–Kutta method with
variable steplength, more details are given in (Endresen, 1997b). Fig. 2 shows the ﬁve membrane currents and Fig.
3 shows the recorded and simulated action potentiald together with the intracellular ionic concentrations. These
computations used the initial conditions stated in table IV.

Cells must generate their membrane potential by actively transporting ions against their concentration gradients.
To examine this process in our model, we ran a simulation starting with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic
concentrations:

[K]i = 5.4 mM ,
[Ca]i = 2 mM ,
[Na]i = 140 mM .

The results are presented in Fig. 4. After approximately 1500 seconds (25 minutes) the system appears to reach a
stable ﬁxed point with the following intracellular ionic concentrations:

At 2500 seconds we kick the cell with a 20 pA pulse of potassium ions with duration 50 ms to see if it wants to oscillate.
It surely does, and the oscillations soon become almost identical to the original oscillations present in Fig. 2 and 3
(you can not see this from Fig. 4 since the time scale is much to big). The values for the concentrations only diﬀer

The trajectory reaches the limit cycle at 2560 seconds, and there is no drift in the intracellular ionic concentrations
from this point to the end of the simulation (at 5000 seconds). The long time simulation in Fig. 4 is a numerical
indication that the oscillation in Fig. 2 and 3 is indeed a stable limit cycle. However, the model also has a stable
ﬁxed point given by (67).

V. DISCUSSION

We have presented a simple model for the cells of the rabbit sinoatrial node. Our model involves only Na+, K+,
and Ca2+ ions, their respective channels, the Na+, Ca2+ exchanger, and the Na+, K+ pump. The equations were
derived using basic physical principles and conservation laws. Since the only source of energy in our model is the
sodium pump, we could easily track the ﬂow of energy in our system. We showed that the pump works to generate
a transmembrane voltage, pressure gradient and ionic concentration gradients. Our equations also accounted for
the energy lost due to downhill ionic ﬂuxes through the exchanger and channels. A prediction of osmotic pressure
variations was a novel result of our energy analysis.

The intracellular ionic concentrations are dynamic variables in our model, governed by the conservation equations
(41), (42), and (43). This allowed us to replace the standard diﬀerential equation for the voltage (40) with the
algebraic equation (51). Although a number of other ionic models also keep track of intracellular ionic concentrations
(see Wilders (1993)), we are unaware of any other model using an algebraic equation for the membrane potential.
Models that use the standard voltage diﬀerential equation (40) have a superﬂuous extra dimension. Furthermore,
the initial conditions for this extra diﬀerential equation cannot be chosen independently of the initial conditions of
the conservation equations (41), (42), and (43) – otherwise, the computed membrane potential will be erroneous.
For these reasons, we suggest that our algebraic expression for the membrane potential should replace the standard
voltage diﬀerential equation in models where intracellular ionic concentrations are dynamic variables.

Our model does not include funny current (if ), ATP sensitive channels, stretch-activated channels, or other ion
channels that may be important (Boyett, 1996). We also ignored the eﬀect of calcium uptake and release from
the sarcoplasmatic reticulum, and the eﬀect of anions like chloride. We have assumed that the ionic channels are
governed by a Markov process. However, since transmembrane proteins can have a large number of conformational
states (Liebovitch, 1995), perhaps a fractal model for the gating would be a better approach. We assumed that
the maximum of the activation/inactivation time constant occurs at the same voltage as the inﬂection point of the
sigmoidal steady state activation/inactivation curve. Also, we have assumed that the cell volume is constant. While
such assumptions reduce the number of parameters in the model, they may also result in discrepancies with experiment.
A natural extension of our model would include a variable cell volume.

Finally, we would like to point out that our model is based on experiments where some were conducted at room
temperature (22–24◦C) (Baruscotti et al., 1996; Muramatsu et al., 1996), while others were performed at 37◦C

13

(Shibasaki, 1987; Hagiwara et al., 1988; Sakai et al., 1996). It is not clear what aﬀect this inconsistency had on the
accuracy of our model.

The values of the parameters gCa, gNa, gK, kNaK and kNaCa, given in table III, are only an estimate of the actual
physiological parameters. We did not systematically study the dynamics of the model for diﬀerent parameters. How-
ever, interested readers can download the source code for the model (in both UNIX and Windows NT environments)
from the following internet site:

http://www.physio.mcgill.ca/guevaralab/singlecell.htm

We hope that future experiments will help us to discriminate between the diﬀerent parameter sets that reproduce the
experimentally recorded action potentials.

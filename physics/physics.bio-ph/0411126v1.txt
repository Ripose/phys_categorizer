Temporal correlations in the brain are thought to have very dichotomic roles. On one hand they
are ubiquitously present in the healthy brain and are thought to underlie feature binding during
information processing. On the other hand large scale synchronization is an underlying mechanism
of epileptic seizures. In this paper we show a possible mechanism of transition to pathological co-
herence underlying seizure generation. We show that properties of phase synchronization in the 2-D
lattice of non-identical coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neurons change radically depending on the connec-
tivity structure. We modify the connectivity using the small world network paradigm and measure
properties of phase synchronization using previously developed measure based on assessment of the
distributions of relative interspike intervals [1]. We show that the phase synchronization undergoes
a dramatic change as a function of locality of network connections from local coherence strongly de-
pendent on the distance between two neurons to global coherence exhibiting stronger phase locking
and spanning the whole network.

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, with underlying seizures generated by indiscriminate,
synchronized bursting of multiple cells in the brain [2], leading to the increased level of coherence in the recorded signal
between individual neurons as well as whole networks [3, 4]. There is a wide range of molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying seizure generation; however, they are often linked to increased excitatory transmission mediated by NMDA,
AMPA or metabotropic glutamate receptors, and a decrease in inhibitory (GABAergic) transmission, causing an
imbalance between excitation and inhibition in the system [5]. One of the mechanisms generating the changes of the
excitatory transmission under pathological conditions is axonal sprouting [6, 7]. This mechanism involves excessive
growth of excitatory processes within an area that was exposed to ischemia or physical trauma, causing (in time)
generation of seizures. We hypothesize that hyperexcitability induced by sprouting could be only one of the causes
of seizures and show that alteration of network structure through introduction of random long-range connectivity in
the network produces relatively abrupt transition in phase coherence in the 2-D small world network (SWN) lattice
of non-identical Hindmarsh-Rose models of thalamocortical neurons [8].

Emergence of the concept of small-world networks [9] has allowed for rigorous study of the properties of intermediate
structured network where the connectivities are neither entirely regular not entirely random. Networks exhibiting
such structure have been identiﬁed in social as well as biological systems [9, 10]. Most studies have concentrated
on their static properties [11, 12, 13]. However, recent work has also focused on the dynamic properties of SWN,
including synchronization. It has been shown that the linear stability of the synchronous state is linked to the algebraic
condition of the Laplacian matrix deﬁning network topology [14, 15]. It has been reported that this synchronized state
is achieved in SWN more eﬃciently (in terms of required network connectivity) than standard deterministic graphs,
purely random graphs and ideal constructive schemes [16]. It has been also shown that the small-world networks of
interconnected Hodgkin-Huxley neurons combine two features: rapid and large oscillatory response to the stimulus
[17]. Properties of self-sustained activity have also been studied in SWN of excitable neurons [18].

It has been established that periodically driven non-linear oscillators or a system of coupled non-identical oscillators
can achieve phase synchronization [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]- the state in which phases are locked but the amplitudes of
the signals are uncorrelated. Since in neural systems, spike generation on the level of individual cells is usually driven
by the same underlying processes [25], although the cells’ speciﬁc properties vary widely it is likely that this type of
synchronization plays the most prominent role in the brain [26].

Here we use a measure that was previously developed by us ([1]) to monitor properties of phase synchronization as
a function of connectivity structure in a 2-dim lattice of non-identical, diﬀusively coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neurons,
where the lattice has SWN structure. The measure monitors the correlations in inter-spike intervals (ISI) between
the neuronal pairs (Fig 1A). This allows us to interpret the phase interdependencies of the coupled units in terms
of relative inter-spike timings. The ISIs are calculated for every neuron pair in the network separately as new spikes
are generated. The distributions are updated dynamically throughout the simulation. After every update, the ISI
distributions are renormalized and the Shannon entropy of the distributions is calculated. Since the distributions

2

depend on the relative timings of spikes of both neurons in the pair, we refer to them as conditional entropies (CEs).
Thus the measure provides an assessment of the instantaneous phase interdependencies between the neurons in the
network without measurement of the phase itself, while the pair wise comparison of CEs allows for asymmetric
measurement of phase interdependencies between any two neurons in the network. Those two characteristics of the
measure make it directly applicable to experimental data.

The equations of the studied neurons are:

˙xi = yi − ax3
˙yi = c − dx2
˙zi = r [s(xi − x0) − zi]

i − yi

i − zi + I0i + α
K−1

j,ki,jk≤R(xj − xi)

P

Initially all neurons within radius R are connected via unidirectional coupling having strength α. Those connections
are than randomly modiﬁed with probability P . The 12x12 lattice has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., torus
topology); the lattice constant is set to unity. The neural parameters in above equations are: a = 1.0, b = 3.0,
c = 1.0, d = 5.0, r = 0.006, s = 4.0, and x0 = −1.6; ;K is the number of actual connections per neuron. The
parameter I0i represents the amplitude of external current applied to the i-th neuron and determines the frequency
as well as type as the dynamical regime of the neuron (periodic, bursting and/or chaotic). The I0i ∈ [2.0, 3.4], and
were generated at random, ensuring that they had non-identical properties.

The phase lag between two non-identical neurons established during phase synchronization depends on their relative
properties (i.e. intrinsic frequencies). The phase of the neuron having higher frequency (higher I0i ) will lead that of
the neuron having lower frequency (Fig 1B). The neurons, depending on the relative values of their control parameters
achieve complete or phase synchronization with varying phase lag.

Based on those results we deﬁne an expectivity function which compares the phase relations in the network to the

relative properties of the neurons (the value of I0i ):

wij =

1 if (Sij − Sji)(I0j − I0i ) > 0
−1 if (Sij − Sji)(I0j − I0i ) ≤ 0

(cid:26)

The expectivity function measures whether the predictions of directionality of phase lag based on the relative values
of the control parameter are in agreement with those established from assessment of pairwise diﬀerences of CEs. If
the value from a given pair is predicted correctly the function is assigned the value wij = 1, and conversely if the
prediction fails wij = −1. Thus if there is a signiﬁcant phase synchronization in the network E → 1, whereas if no
phase synchrony is established E ≃ 0 (Fig 3C).

We have used the expectivity function to measure properties of phase synchronization in a sparsely coupled 2D
lattice of networked H-R neurons. The rewiring probability P was varied from 0 (full local connectivity within the
radius R) to 1 (random graph). The radius R = 1, 2, 3 determined the connectivity fraction in the network (0.028,
0.083, 0.194 respectively).

We have created histograms of the expectivity of all neuron pairs in the network as a function of their relative
Euclidean distance on the lattice. This allowed us to infer the local as well as global properties of phase synchronization
in the network. We have observed that for low values of P the phase relations are preserved over short distances and
the expectivities over longer distances quickly converge to zero. However, as P increases global phase synchrony is
achieved in the network (Fig 2). Moreover, neurons in the networks exhibiting global phase synchrony regime may
achieve signiﬁcantly higher degree of phase locking than that achieved even for short spatial distances in the networks
with low P (Fig 2).

The abruptness of the transition from local phase synchrony to global phase synchrony depends on the connectivity
as well as the coupling constant. To depict those changes, we have plotted the average decay ratio of the expectivity
as a function of rewiring probability

DR,α(P ) =

ER,α(L = 1, P = 0) − ER,α(L = max, P )
ER,α(L = 1, P = 0)

where ER,α(L, P ) is the expectivity averaged over all neuronal pairs having average distance L, computed for the
network with rewiring probability P , radius R, and coupling strength α. Positive values of the decay (D) indicate local

FIG. 1: A: Individual distributions are updated for every neuron using the relative durations of the ISI of every neuron with
respect to the other in the pair (for all the possible pairs in the network). Speciﬁcally, the ISI, ∆tij
m, of the j-th neuron with
respect to the i-th neuron is calculated as a time diﬀerence between the ISI timing of the j-th neuron with respect to the last
spike of the i-th neuron, and conversely the ISI ∆tji
m of the i-th neuron is calculated as a time diﬀerence between the ISI of
neuron j with respect to the timing of the last spike taking place on the j-th neuron. The distributions are updated every
time new spike is generated.B: changes in the phase lag (as measured by CEs)in response to changes in the relative values of
I0i for a system two H-R neurons. Initially the neurons are uncoupled (α = 0) with the same control parameters (I0i = 3.3).
Both of the CEs are high (no phase synchronization is present). After 40s the coupling is introduced (α = 1.2). The CE of
both neurons converges to zero indicating complete synchronization. After another 40ms the value of I02 = 3.4. The CE with
respect to neuron 1 is high, whereas the other one is zero indicating phase synchronization with neuron 1 lagging behind neuron
2. After another 40s the control parameters are modiﬁed so that I01 = 3.33 and I0i = 3.1 reversing that of the previous case.
The CE calculated with respect to neuron 2 is high, whereas the other one is zero indicating that neuron 2 is now lagging
behind neuron 1. Finally, again α = 0 and any phase relations are abolished. C: Changes in the expectivity function for fully

phase synchrony, whereas D ≃ 0 indicates global phase synchrony in the network. Negative values of D(P ) indicate
an increased level of phase locking in globally synchronous case in comparison with that of the locally synchronous
case (see Fig 2). The critical value of rewiring probability at which the transition takes place ﬂuctuates around
P ≃ 0.3 − 0.4. This coincides with the values of P at which the structural clustering coeﬃcient rapidly decays [9].
Moreover, it has been found that the clustering coeﬃcient for C. elegans, an example of a completely mapped neural
network is 0.28, which corresponds to a rewiring probability of P ≃ 0.3 (assuming perfect SWN structure), indicating
that the neural systems may form networks, where network structure lies in this critical regime between local and
global synchrony. Creation of spurious glutamatergic connections in an injured region (sprouting) may cause the
balance to be shifted toward global phase synchrony and thus creation of epileptic seizures.

The increase in quality of global phase synchrony over local phase synchrony also depends on the coupling constant
alpha. For lower values of alpha there is no signiﬁcant increase in the degree of global phase synchrony over the
degree of local phase synchrony observed on short distances. When the coupling is increased there is a signiﬁcant

chronization remains local for low values of P (expectivity declines as a function of neuronal distance), whereas global phase
synchronization is obtained for P > 0.3. Additionally, for high values of P the degree of phase locking is greater overall than
that observed for local phase synchrony. The graph is formed by binning the values of expectivity for all neural pairs that have
Euclidean distance within the noted distance range; α = 2.0, R = 2. Every point on the graph is an average over 4 trials.

In conclusion, we have applied the measure our to monitor the properties of phase synchronization in the two
dimensional lattice of coupled H-R neurons having SWN connectivity. Using this measure, we have observed a
transition from local phase synchrony which falls oﬀ as a function of neuronal distance, to global synchrony that is
independent of this distance. We have also observed that the degree of the phase locking increases in the case of global
synchrony when the coupling is strong. This eﬀect could possibly play an important role in the emergence of epilepsy

FIG. 4: Changes in |∆Sij | as a function of Euclidean distance between the neurons. The entropic diﬀerences exhibit the
same behavior as the one observed for the expectivity function. This allows the direct application of the measure to the
experimental data, where the parameters of the individual neurons can not be determined. The |∆Sij | were calculated for the
same parameters as those listed on Fig 2.

as it is known that one of the mechanisms of epileptic seizure generation is based on the sprouting of glutamatergic
processes within the injured brain region. Incidentally an additional advantage of the devised measure is the fact
that it can be applied directly to experimental data. The expectivity function, which can not be assessed in the case
of real data because the internal parameters of individual neurons are not known, can be substituted by pairwise
calculation of the average absolute value of entropic diﬀerences between individual neurons |∆Sij |. The behavior of
both measures is virtually the same (Fig. 4).

Moreover, although it requires further investigation, it may be signiﬁcant that the clustering coeﬃcient for C. elegans
implies the value of the rewiring probability that is relatively close to the observed transition point between local and
global phase synchrony [9], possibly indicating that the brain connectivity lies relatively close to that transition point.

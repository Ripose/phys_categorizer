Abstract

We investigate a map-based model of paced cardiac muscle in the presence of closed-loop feedback

control. The model relates the duration of an action potential to the preceding diastolic interval

as well as the preceding action potential duration and thus has some amount of ‘memory.’ We ﬁnd

that the domain of control depends on this memory, independently of the speciﬁc functional form

of the map. The memory-dependent domain of control can encompass large feedback gains, thus

providing the ﬁrst possible explanation of the recent experimental results of Hall et al. [Phys. Rev.

Lett, 88, 198102 (2002)] on controlling alternans in small pieces of rapidly-paced cardiac muscle.

Sudden cardiac death, primarily caused by ventricular arrhythmias, is a major public

health problem:

it is one of the leading causes of mortality in the western world. A pos-

sible precursor of some arrhythmias is the beat-to-beat variation of the cardiac electrical

excitation occurring at fast heart rates [1, 2]. This variation appears as a sequence of long-

short-long-short cycles (termed alternans) in important physiological characteristics such as

action potential duration (APD) and conduction time. A focus of recent theoretical and ex-

perimental studies is to investigate the mechanisms causing alternans and to terminate this

response pattern using closed-loop feedback methods developed by the nonlinear dynamics

community. Suppressing such alternans may then prevent the onset of ﬁbrillation [3].

Over the last few years, several studies have demonstrated that alternans can be sup-

pressed with dynamic feedback control of the pacing interval [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Control of alter-

nans in the conduction time across the atrioventricular (AV) node has been demonstrated

in both in vitro rabbit hearts [5] and in vivo human hearts [8]. The observed AV-nodal

alternans are known to be well described by a one-dimensional map-based mathematical

model [8]. The model can be used to predict the range of control parameters that stabilize

the desired response patterns.

Recently, Hall et al.

[4] demonstrated successful control of alternans in small pieces of

in vitro paced bullfrog ventricles. Understanding how to control ventricular myocardium is

important because it is the primary substrate for ﬁbrillation. Controlling alternans in ven-

tricular myocardium was expected to be more diﬃcult than controlling AV-nodal alternans

because past research suggests that its dynamics is more complicated. On the contrary, the

experiments described in Ref.

[4] demonstrated that alternans could be suppressed over a

wide range of control parameters and over the entire range of pacing rates for which alter-

nans was observed. The observations were compared to the predictions of two map-based

mathematical models. Fitting the bifurcation diagrams of the mathematical models to the

experimental data did not produce good ﬁts for their domains of control. Speciﬁcally, con-

trol of alternans was observed for feedback gains as large as four in the experiments, whereas

the models predicted that the gain must be less than

0.4 and limited to a small region of

∼

pacing rates near the bifurcation to alternans.

The primary purpose of this Letter is to analyze a map-based model of paced cardiac

muscle in the presence of closed-loop feedback control. The model contains some degree of

‘memory’ so its dynamics displays higher-dimensional behavior. We ﬁnd that the domain of

2

control can encompass large feedback gains, qualitatively consistent with the experiments

of Hall et al. Our results demonstrate that higher-dimensional eﬀects can enhance the

eﬀectiveness of control under the appropriate conditions. This may lead eventually to the

development of methods for in vivo control of whole-heart functions. Future experiments are

needed to determine whether the speciﬁc form of memory considered here is displayed by

cardiac tissue. Nevertheless, our results indicate the importance of memory in the control

of alternans.

given by [9, 10]

To set the stage for understanding the behavior of the higher-dimensional model, we ﬁrst

consider a simpler one-dimensional map that contains no memory. This mapping model is

An+1 = f (Dn),

(1)

where An+1 is the APD generated by the (n + 1)st stimulus, and Dn is the nth diastolic

interval (DI), i.e.

the interval during which the tissue recovers to its resting state after

the end of the previous (nth) action potential. We illustrate a typical bifurcation diagram

in Fig. 1a. Note that the tissue has a stable 1:1 response pattern (every stimulus elicits

an action potential of equal duration) for long pacing intervals (slow pacing rate). As the

pacing interval decreases (faster pacing), the 1:1 response becomes unstable and a transition

to alternans (2:2 response) occurs. At even faster pacing rates, the 2:2 response pattern

becomes unstable and is replaced by a stable 2:1 response where an action potential is

produced by every second stimulus. For the 1:1 and 2:2 responses considered herein, the

pacing relation between APD and DI is Dn = B

An, where B is the basic pacing interval.

−

For this simple model, the transition from 1:1 to 2:2 behavior shown in the Fig. 1a can be

understood by investigating the restitution properties of the cardiac membrane. Speciﬁcally,

to predict the pacing rates at which the 1:1 response is stable, one constructs the restitution

curve (RC) by plotting APD as a function f of the preceding DI, as in (1). Nolasco and

Dahlen [9] proposed that the transition to alternans occurs when the slope of the RC is equal

to unity. However, recent studies [4, 11, 12, 13, 14] have shown that the slope of the RC at

the onset of alternans can be signiﬁcantly larger than unity and thus this criterion fails to

predict the existence of alternans in some cases. Later in the paper, we analyze the map (1),

independently of the speciﬁc form of the function f , in the presence of closed-loop feedback

control and discuss why it fails to explain the experimental observations. In contrast to the

memoryless model (1), we ﬁnd that a cardiac mapping model of the form

An+1 = F (An, Dn)

(2)

can possess a domain of control that encompasses large control gains, independently of

the speciﬁc form of F . This model has some amount of memory because it relates the

duration of the next action potential both to the previous DI and to the previous APD,

i.e., the history of the dynamical system. Several previous studies [11, 15, 16, 17] indicate

that higher-dimensional behavior (so-called memory eﬀects) is present in real cardiac tissue

and thus has to be taken into account in order to correctly predict the onset of alternans.

The general form of this model was ﬁrst introduced by Otani and Gilmour [15] to explain

4

empirical observations from paced dog cardiac Purkinje ﬁbers. More recently, a speciﬁc form

of F was derived analytically [18] from a three-current ionic model [19].

Our analysis of the model (2) shows that it displays rate-dependent restitution so that

there exist two primary types of RCs (the dynamic and S1-S2 RCs), which can be measured

independently using diﬀerent pacing protocols [14].

In the dynamic pacing protocol, the

pacing interval B1 is held ﬁxed until the tissue reaches equilibrium, and then progressively
shortened. This yields pairs of steady-state values (A∗, D∗) for each B1.

In the S1-S2

pacing protocol, a premature stimulus (“S2”) is delivered at an interval B2 after pacing the

tissue with a suﬃciently large number of “S1” stimuli at a pacing interval B1 so that the

tissue reaches equilibrium. The S1-S2 RC is determined by measuring the resulting APD for

various coupling intervals B2. Experimental studies have shown that the S1-S2 and dynamic

RCs diﬀer signiﬁcantly, and have diﬀerent slopes (denoted as S12 and Sdyn, respectively).

This is consistent with the predictions of the mapping model (2). The transition to alternans

is governed by the combination of the slopes Sdyn and S12, so that alternans can exist when

where F ′ is the full derivative of F , with respect to An, evaluated at a ﬁxed point [14]. Note

that Sdyn = S12 when there is no memory in the model, and that they diﬀer substantially

when there is large memory. A typical bifurcation diagram showing alternans in the mapping

model (2) is presented in Fig. 1b, where the slopes of the RCs are diﬀerent and do not equal

unity at the onset of alternans.

We now consider control of alternans in both models (1) and (2). To suppress alternans

and stabilize the 1:1 pattern, Hall et al. [4] adjusted the pacing period by an amount given

Note that the domain does not depend on the speciﬁc functional form of f , but only on the

γ that should be used to establish control of alternans for diﬀerent values of the Floquet

multiplier µ, which describes the stability of the map in the absence of control. Note that

the gain necessary to establish control in the region where alternans exist in the absence of

control is small (0 < γ < √2

As in Eq. (7), we denote µ as a full derivative of F , evaluated at the ﬁxed point. As seen

from Eq. (3), the condition for the existence of alternans in the absence of control is given

by µ

it characterizes the immediate response of the tissue to small perturbations from the ﬁxed

point, as was shown in Ref. [14]. Hence, we expect that S12 is more relevant for determining

the eﬀects of control, whereas µ dictates the stability of the steady-state response of the

In the memoryless

mapping model (1), the magnitude of perturbation sensitivity is proportional to the full

derivative µ, whereas it is proportional to the slope S12 of the S1-S2 RC in the mapping

model with memory (2). When there is no memory, S12 =

µ, whereas they can diﬀer

By analyzing (13), we ﬁnd that control is successful when µ and γS12 lie within the region

Similar to the previous model, the domain of control (14) does not depend on the speciﬁc

form of the function F . We only need to know the values of the full derivative µ and the

slope of the S1-S2 RC S12 (evaluated at the ﬁxed point) to determine whether it is possible to

establish control. Figure 2b depicts the domain of control for the one-dimensional mapping

model with memory (2) according to conditions (14). Alternans may exist in the uncontrolled

system when µ

1. It can be seen from Fig. 2b that the value of γS12 necessary to establish

control for this region is relatively small (0 < γS12 < √2

1). However, the actual control

≤ −

−

gain γ can be larger or smaller than this range depending on the value of S12. Our predictions

are consistent with our earlier expectations that S12 inﬂuences the eﬀects of control since it

quantiﬁes the response of the tissue (in equilibrium) to a sudden perturbation, which the

controller attempts to cancel.

Comparing our predictions to experiments is not possible at this time because no exper-

iments have measured the slope of the S1-S2 RC evaluated at the ﬁxed point [20]. Most of

the experiments (see, for instance, Refs. [17, 21]) used S1-S2 pacing protocol in which the

“S1” interval was either ﬁxed or set to only a few diﬀerent values. Instead, to make a direct

comparison of the domain of control obtained using mapping model (2) to the one obtained

experimentally in Ref.

[4], we need to know the slope of the S1-S2 RC S12 at each point

on the dynamic RC, i.e., for diﬀerent S1. The value S12 can be greater or less than one,

depending on the speciﬁc form of F or the speciﬁc type of tissue. For example, S12 > 1 for

the function F used to generate the plot shown in Fig. 1b. Hence, the control gain γ must

be less than (√2

1) to be in the region where control is eﬀective. However, preliminary,

−

experiments with bullfrog cardiac muscle indicate that S12 can be relatively small (less than

8

0.4 and as small as 0.05) at the onset of alternans [22] and thus the control gain could be

large.

Thus, the experimentally measured domain of control may be consistent with the predic-

tions of the controlled map with memory (2) if S12 is truly less than one in bullfrog. The

map without memory (1) does not agree with experiments as demonstrated by Fig. 2a and

as noted previously in Ref.

[4]. Our analysis is the ﬁrst to suggest that memory eﬀects

may substantially enlarge the domain of control, regulated by S12. Future experiments are

needed to clarify the eﬀects of memory on control.

A limitation of our analysis is that the extent of cardiac memory is only one previous beat

in the model (2), so that the memory is short-term. However, some studies indicate that

long-term memory eﬀects are present in real cardiac tissue [21] that might be described using

a long-term memory mapping model [12, 16]. In this model, an additional memory variable

is introduced, which is assumed to accumulate during the APD and dissipate during the

DI. Analysis of this model [12] conﬁrms that the slope of the dynamic RC does not predict

the transition to alternans, but it was shown in Ref.

[4] that a speciﬁc form of such a

memory model cannot explain the experiments on control of alternans. We believe that a

generalization of the mapping model (2) that includes long-term memory as in [12, 16] may

be a fruitful direction for future investigations.

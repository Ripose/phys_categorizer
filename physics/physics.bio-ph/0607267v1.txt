Abstract

Many proteins interact with and deform double-stranded DNA in cells. Single-molecule
experiments have studied the elasticity of DNA with helix-deforming proteins, including proteins
that bend DNA. These experiments increase the need for theories of DNA elasticity which
include helix-deforming proteins. Previous theoretical work on bent DNA has examined a long
DNA molecule with many nonspeciﬁcally binding proteins. However, recent experiments used
relatively short DNA molecules with a single, well-deﬁned bend site. Here we develop a simple,
theoretical description of the eﬀect of a single bend. We then include the description of the bend
in the ﬁnite worm like chain model (FWLC) of short DNA molecules attached to beads. We
predict how the DNA force-extension relation changes due to formation of a single permanent
kink, at all values of the applied stretching force. Our predictions show that high-resolution
single-molecule experiments could determine the bend angle induced upon protein binding.

Keywords: DNA elasticity, force-extension measurements, helix-deforming proteins, transcrip-

tion factors, bent DNA, theory.

Introduction

In cells, many diﬀerent interactions between DNA and proteins occur, processes which are essential
to gene expression, genome replication, and cellular DNA management. One major class of proteins
interacts with DNA and mechanically deforms the double helix by wrapping, looping, twisting, or
bending DNA (1, 2). Examples include DNA-packaging proteins and transcription factors which
regulate gene expression. The mechanical deformation of the DNA may be important for gene
expression: it has been suggested that DNA deformation by transcription factors may help other
proteins bind to the DNA and initiate transcription.

The deformation of DNA by proteins can be detected in single-molecule force microscopy. In
this experimental method, force is applied to individual DNA molecules and the DNA end-to-end
extension is measured (ﬁgure 1). Single-molecule force microscopy has been used to detect the

1

deformation of DNA caused by protein binding (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). In these experiments the DNA
end-to-end extension changes when a deformation-inducing protein binds. Varying the applied
force allows one to probe the deformation and better understand the details of the protein-DNA
interaction.

In this paper we focus on proteins that bend the DNA backbone and develop theoretical pre-
dictions of the force-extension behavior of bent DNA. Our description is based on the worm-like
chain theory (WLC) (9, 10, 11). The WLC predicts the average end-to-end extension z of a semi-
ﬂexible polymer, given the force F applied to the ends of the chain and the values of two constant
parameters (the contour length L and the persistence length A). However, DNA elastic behavior
is altered by backbone-deforming proteins, an eﬀect that is not included in the traditional WLC.
Extended theories have been developed which combine the WLC treatment of DNA elasticity with
local bends. Rivetti et al. addressed the case of zero applied force (12), while Yan and Marko
have described the changes in the force-extension behavior of a long polymer to which many kink-
inducing proteins can bind nonspeciﬁcally (13). Similarly, Popov and Tkachenko studied the eﬀects
of a large number of reversible kinks (14), Metzler et al. studied loops formed by slip-rings (15) ,
and Kuli´c et al. studied the high-force limit of a kinked polymer (16).

Previous theoretical work has focused on large numbers of reversible kinks or the limit of low
or high applied force. However, recent single-molecule experiments have examined relatively short
DNA molecules with a single speciﬁc kink site, over a range of applied force (7). Therefore a theory
is needed which applies to (i) one kink site and (ii) a polymer of ﬁnite contour length (L/A ∼ 1−10).
Recently, we introduced a modiﬁed solution of the WLC applicable to polymers of this length, and
demonstrated that applying the traditional WLC solution to molecules with L/A ∼ 1 − 10 can lead
to signiﬁcant errors (17). Our ﬁnite worm-like chain solution (FWLC) includes both ﬁnite-length
eﬀects, often neglected in WLC calculations, and the eﬀect of the rotational ﬂuctuations of a bead
attached to the end of the chain.

[Figure 1 about here.]

Here we formulate a theoretical description of a single kink induced by a protein, and extend the
FWLC treatment to include such local distortions. Our theory has a simple analytical formulation
for the case of a force-independent bend angle, i.e., a rigid protein-DNA complex. Our predictions
are relevant to experiments like those of Dixit et al. (7), which detect with high resolution a single
bend induced in a relatively short DNA molecule. Although we will primarily focus on the case
of a single bend angle, our method can also describe a kink which takes on diﬀerent angles with
diﬀerent probabilities. This model could be relevant to a binding protein that can ﬂuctuate between
diﬀerent binding conformations with diﬀerent kink angles (18).

2 Theory

2.1 FWLC theory of unkinked DNA

[Figure 2 about here.]

The classic WLC model (10) and the FWLC theory (17), which includes ﬁnite-length eﬀects, de-
scribe an inextensible polymer with isotropic bending rigidity. The bending rigidity is characterized
by the persistence length, A, the length scale over which thermal ﬂuctuations randomize the chain
orientation. We assume that the twist is unconstrained and can be neglected (as is the case, for
example, in optical tweezer experiments).

For relatively short DNA molecules (ℓ ∼ 1−10), the boundary conditions at the ends of the chain
(17, 21) and bead rotational ﬂuctuations become important. The boundary conditions are speciﬁed
by two probability density functions, ψ(ˆt, s = 0) and ψ(ˆt, s = L). The boundary conditions modify
the force-extension relation, and enter the full partition function matrix element via

Ztot =

dˆti dˆtf ψ(ˆti, 0)Z(ˆti, 0;ˆtf , L)ψ(ˆtf , L).

Z

Rotational ﬂuctuations of the bead(s) attached to the end of the DNA complicate the analysis of
experiments. What is observed and controlled is not the endpoint of the (invisible) DNA chain,
but rather the bead’s center. The relation between these distinct points ﬂuctuates as the bead
performs rotational Brownian motion. The FLWC theory accounts for these ﬂuctuations via an
eﬀective boundary condition at the end(s) of the chain, which depends on applied force, bead
radius, and the nature of the link joining the bead to the polymer (17). We will study boundary
conditions that are azimuthally symmetric; thus our end boundary conditions will be functions of
ˆt · ˆz only.

2.2 Fixed-angle bend

We now suppose that our chain contains a permanent bend, whose location along the DNA, and
In this paper we will also neglect force-induced
angle, are ﬁxed, independent of applied force.

(These eﬀects are straightforward to incorporate into our

analysis.)
In addition, we neglect twist stiﬀness, which is legitimate since we wish to study a
single bend in a polymer with unconstrained twist. (Twist stiﬀness eﬀects will be important for
experiments in which multiple bends occur or twist is constrained.)

The Schr¨odinger-like equation (4) must be modiﬁed by the inclusion of a “bend operator”
which transforms ψ at the bend. Suppose that the kink occurs at position so. Given the tangent-
vector probability distribution ψ at so − ǫ (where ǫ is inﬁnitesimal), our goal is to determine
ψ(ˆt, so + ǫ), the distribution just after the kink. If we denote the exterior angle of the kink by α,
then ˆtso−ǫ ·ˆtso+ǫ = cos α. Because twist is unconstrained, we may average over rotations; eﬀectively,
the bend occurs with uniform probability in the azimuthal angle: if ˆtso−ǫ points directly along the
ˆz-axis, then ˆtso+ǫ is uniformly distributed in a cone at angle α to the ˆz-axis.

The bend operator then can be written using the kernel

Kα(ˆt,ˆt′

) =

δ(ˆt · ˆt′ − cos α).

Below (section 3.2) we show that spherical harmonics diagonalize the operator (6).

2.2.1 Distribution of bend angles

Suppose that the bend occurs not for a single ﬁxed angle, but a distribution of angles. We assume
that ˆtso−ǫ · ˆtso+ǫ = cos α = u is distributed according to the probability density function h(u),
du h(u) = 1. Then the bend-operator kernel can be written
where h is normalized so that

3 Calculation

The main quantity of interest in single-molecule experiments is the force-extension relation, which
can be determined by solving equation (4) for the tangent-vector probability distribution ψ(ˆt, s).
The Schr¨odinger-like equation is solved using separation of variables in s and ˆt, where the angular
dependence is expanded in spherical harmonics (10).

(By azimuthal symmetry, only the m = 0 terms will enter in our formulae.) In the basis of spherical
harmonics, the operator in equation (4) is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix H with diagonal terms

and oﬀ-diagonal terms

the inﬁnite series of spherical harmonics is used.

3.1 Force-extension relation

Given the boundary conditions Ψ(s = 0) and Ψ(s = ℓ), the partition function is

(13)

(14)

We work in the ensemble relevant to most experiments, where the extension is determined for ﬁxed
applied force (diﬀerent ensembles are not equivalent for single ﬁnite-length molecules (22, 23, 24)).
Equation (14) applies for a chain of any length. However, we can show the structure of the partition
function more clearly by separating ln Z into two terms: one representing an inﬁnite chain and a
ﬁnite-length correction (17). Let B = eH, denote by λ∗ the largest eigenvalue of B, and let
B = B/λ∗. Then B has eigenvalues with magnitude less than or equal to 1 and the logarithm of
the partition function can be written

ln Z = ℓ ln λ∗ + ln[ΨT (s = ℓ)BℓΨ(s = 0)].

(15)

Only the ﬁrst term is considered in the usual WLC solution; the second term is the ﬁnite-length
correction (17). Equation (15) is an exact expression for ln Z which is diﬃcult to evaluatae analyt-
ically. We numerically calculate the force-extension relation by using equation (15) with the series
truncated after N terms. This expression can be accurately numerically calculated, and the trun-
cation error determined by comparing the results with diﬀerent N . Our calculations use N = 30
unless otherwise speciﬁed.

3.1.1 Boundary conditions and bead rotational ﬂuctuations

The boundary conditions at s = 0 and s = ℓ aﬀect the force-extension relation, because they
alter the partition function as shown in equation (15). Some experiments appear to implement
“half-constrained” boundary conditions, where the polymer is attached to a planar wall by a freely
rotating attachment point, and the wall is perpendicular to the direction of applied force (25). In
this case the tangent vector at the end of the chain can point in any direction on the hemisphere
outside the impenetrable surface (ﬁgure 2(b)). The eﬀects of diﬀerent boundary conditions on the
force-extension relation are considered in detail in reference (17). In the “unconstrained” boundary
condition the tangent vector at the end of the chain is free to point in any direction on the sphere
(in 4π of solid angle, ﬁgure 2a). In this case ψ(ˆt) is independent of cos θ and Ψ = (1, 0, · · · , 0). In
the “half-constrained” boundary conditions (ﬁgure 2b), the tangent vector at the end of the chain
can point in any direction on the hemisphere outside the impenetrable surface; then the leading
coeﬃcients of Ψ are 1, 0.8660, 0, -0.3307, 0, 0.2073, 0. In the “normal” boundary condition, the
tangent vector at the end of the chain is parallel to the ˆz axis, normal to the surface (ﬁgure 2c).
Then the coeﬃcients of Ψ are all equal to 1 (26).

The FWLC formulation can also average over rotational ﬂuctuations of spherical bead(s) at-
tached to one or both ends of the polymer chain. The result is an eﬀective boundary condition that

5

depends on applied force and bead radius (17). Both the case of perpendicular wall attachment
and bead attachment generate boundary conditions that are invariant under rotations about the ˆz
axis (the direction in which force is applied), and hence give boundary states of the form given in
equation (9).

3.2 Bend operator

We wish to represent the bend operator (equation (7)) in terms of spherical harmonics; the operator
is diagonal in this basis. Denote x = ˆt · ˆt′ and note that any function of x with −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 can be
written as a series of Legendre polynomials (27):

The transformation can thus be written Ψlm(so + ǫ) = Pl(cos α)Ψlm(so − ǫ). The probability
distribution just after the kink diﬀers from the distribution before the kink only in the multiplication
of each term in the series by Pl(cos α). We can represent the transformation by a diagonal matrix
W such that

Ψ(so + ǫ) = W Ψ(so − ǫ).

(26)

Because ψ is azimuthally symmetric (only the m = 0 terms appear in the series expansion), W has
entries Wl,l = Pl−1(cos α).

3.2.1 Distribution of bend angles

The representation of the bend operator in terms of spherical harmonics remains simple when
the bend contains a distribution of angles described by h(u) (equation (8)). As above, we expand
Kh(x) in Legendre polynomials, Kh(x) =
klPl(x). The kl are the projection of h(x) onto Legendre
polynomials:

The calculation is then identical to the case of a single bend angle, with the result Ψlm(so + ǫ) =
klΨlm(so − ǫ). We can represent the transformation by a diagonal matrix Wh such that

Ψ(so + ǫ) = WhΨ(so − ǫ).

3.3 Force-extension relation with bend

Once the matrix W (which represents the bend operator in the basis of spherical harmonics) has
been determined, calculation of the force-extension relation is straightforward. Suppose a single
bend occurs at fractional position a along the chain. The partition function with a bend is

Zb = ΨT (s = ℓ)e(1−a)ℓH W eaℓHΨ(s = 0),

As before, we let B = eH, denote by λ∗ the largest eigenvalue of B, and deﬁne B = B/λ∗. Using
eℓH = λℓ

∗Bℓ, the logarithm of the partition function is

ln Zb = ℓ ln λ∗ + ln[ΨT (s = ℓ) B(1−a)ℓW Baℓ Ψ(s = 0)].

As above, the extension is z/L = ℓ−1 ∂ ln Z/∂f.

4 Results

Here we predict the magnitude of extension change induced by a single bend, in order to understand
when such single-bending events will be experimentally detectable. We describe how the extension
change induced by a bend depends on applied force, bend angle, contour length, and the position
of the bend.

In ﬁgure 3 we show the change in extension induced by a bend: the extension of the chain
without the bend minus the extension of the chain with the bend. As expected, the extension
change is larger when the bend angle is larger. In addition, we ﬁnd that the change in extension
has a maximum near an applied force of 0.1 pN. At this force, the change in extension due to the
bend is a signiﬁcant fraction of the persistence length (10-30 nm for A = 50 nm).

(27)

(29)

(30)

[Figure 3 about here.]

For the largest bend angle, we show for comparison the prediction of Kuli´c et al. (16). The
Kuli´c et al. result is valid in the high-force limit, and we ﬁnd that their prediction and our result
converge as the force becomes large. The Kuli´c et al. result is valuable because it is a simple
analytical expression. Although our results are obtained numerically, they are valid over the entire
force range.

As the applied force increases, the polymer becomes more stretched and aligned with the force,
decreasing the eﬀect of the bend. For a classical elastic rod where thermal ﬂuctuations are a weak
kbT A/F . Therefore,
perturbation the characteristic propagation length of elastic deformations is
as the force increases, the region of the chain experiencing a signiﬁcant deﬂection due to the bend
drops. By this argument, one might expect that the largest change in extension due to the bend
will occur for the lowest values of the applied force. However, as the force applied to the ends of the
polymer goes to zero, the extension also approaches zero (on average, there will be no separation
of the two ends). In this case the change in extension due to the bend approaches zero. The eﬀect
of the bend is therefore largest at intermediate force, where the molecule is extended by the force
but not fully extended.

p

We predicted the change in extension due to the bend with and without a bead attached to one
end of the DNA, and for diﬀerent values of the bead radius. In all cases, we predict similar values
for the change in extension due to a bend (not shown).

[Figure 4 about here.]

In ﬁgure 4 we show how the change in extension induced by the bend varies with bend angle. The
dependence of the extension change on angle is strong, suggesting that high-resolution experiments
could measure the bend angle by measuring the change in extension due to a bend. For larger
values of the applied force (F ≥1 pN), the result is independent of contour length of the polymer.
However at low force (F =0.1 pN), where the change in extension due to a bend is largest, the
results depend on the polymer contour length.

[Figure 5 about here.]

The dependence on the position of the bend is weak, unless the bend is within a few percent of
one end of the polymer (ﬁgure 5). We note that the curves in ﬁgure 5 are not reﬂection symmetric
about the middle of the polymer. This occurs because we assume one end of the polymer (s = 0) is
attached to a ﬁxed surface, while the other end of the polymer (s = 1) is attached to a bead which
can undergo rotational ﬂuctuations. We chose to plot this case because it is a typical experimental
geometry; in the case that both ends of the polymer experience identical boundary conditions, then
the eﬀects of a bend obey reﬂection symmetry about the middle of the polymer.

5 Discussion

We have described a theory of DNA elasticity applicable to bent DNA molecules. The ﬁnite worm-
like chain model (FWLC) of polymer elasticity extends the WLC to polymers with L/A ∼ 1 − 10
(17). The FWLC includes chain-end boundary conditions and rotational ﬂuctuations of a bead
attached to the end of the polymer, modiﬁcations which are important for polymers with contour
length a few times the persistence length.

This work allows predictions of DNA force-extension behavior when a single bend occurs at a
speciﬁed point along the chain. When the bend angle is constant (independent of applied force) the
bend operator is diagonal in the basis of spherical harmonics, allowing straightforward calculation

8

of the eﬀects of a bend. This mathematical description of a bend is suitable both for a bend with
a single angle and for bends with a distribution of diﬀerent bend angles.

We demonstrate that the change in polymer end-to-end extension induced by the bend can be a
signiﬁcant fraction of the polymer persistence length: ∆z/A ∼ 0.2 − 0.7 for bend angles of 90-180o,
or ∆z ∼ 10 − 35 nm for dsDNA, which has persistence length of approximately 50 nm. The change
in extension due to the bend is predicted to show a maximum for applied force around 0.1 pN;
for larger force the polymer conformation becomes highly extended and the inﬂuence of the bend
decreases, while for low force the polymer extension approaches zero, independent of the presence
of the bend.

The alterations in polymer extension induced by the bend should be detectable in high-resolution
single-molecule experiments. Since recent work in single-molecule optical trapping with DNA has
demonstrated a resolution of a few nm(28, 29), DNA extension changes of 10-35 nm due to a bend
should be detectable. Furthermore, the predicted change in extension strongly depends on the
bend angle, suggesting that high-resolution single-molecule experiments could directly estimate the
angle of a protein-induced bend.

[26] Note that for the computation of the force-extension relation, it is not necessary to properly
normalize the probability distribution, because we are computing the derivative of the loga-
rithm of Z. Our expressions for the probability distribution vectors will neglect the constant
normalization factor.

DNA molecule is attached at one end to a surface and at the other end to a bead (radius R). A
force F is applied to the bead. (a) DNA molecule in the absence of bound protein. The mean
end-to-end extension is z. (b) DNA molecule with a single bend-inducing protein bound. The
protein bends the DNA backbone through the external angle α at the bend site. As a result, the
mean extension decreases to zbend.

Figure 3: Change in extension due to a bend as a function of force, determined by subtracting the
extension of the chain with the bend from the extension without the bend. The contour length is
(A) L=200 nm and (B) L=500 nm. For larger contour lengths, the prediction is similar to (B).
We assume A = 50 nm, the bend is at the midpoint of the polymer, a bead of radius 250 nm is
attached to one end of the chain, and half-constrained boundary conditions. For the largest bend
angle, we show for comparison the prediction of Kuli´c et al. (16), which is valid in the high-force
limit.

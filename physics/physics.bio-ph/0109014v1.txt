Abstract

T-cell activation plays a critical role in the initiation and propagation of HIV-1
infection and yet transient activation of the immune system is a normal response to
immunization. In this study we extend a simple of model of HIV infection to include T
cell activation by vaccination. We then show that the model can reproduce many but
not all of the features of the post-tetanus immunization rise in viral load observed and
reported on by Stanley et al., [ N. Engl. J. Med., 334:1222–1230 (1996)]. Amplitudes
and approximate timing of post-immunization maximum viremia were matched in
nine of twelve cases; in patients with double peaks of nearly equal amplitude the
later peaks were matched. Patients with single early peaks in their viremia were best
ﬁt with relatively high antigen clearance rate constants, while patients with early
and late peaks in viremia of equal or nearly equal amplitude were best-ﬁt with much
lower clearance rates. The rate of clearance may depend on the level of pre-existing
antibody, which in turn would be expected to depend on the time since the individual
under study received a previous tetanus vaccination.

Introduction

T-cell activation plays a critical role in HIV infection and progression to AIDS [Fauci,
1993, Stanley et al., 1996, Wahl and Orenstein, 1997] In vitro studies have demon-
strated the importance of cell activation in establishing productive HIV infection.
Studies by Zack et al., [1990] and Bukrinsky et al., [1991] have shown that within
resting cells reverse transcription may be incomplete and integration of proviral DNA
may not occur, resulting in abortive infection.
In contrast, activated peripheral
blood mononuclear cells are readily infected in culture [Zack et al.,1990, Bukrin-
sky et al.,1991, Folks et al., 1986]. The course of HIV infection in vivo appears to be
inﬂuenced by cell activation. High levels of activated peripheral T cells are a predic-
tor of early progression to AIDS [Levacher et al., 1990, Giorgi and Detels, 1989], and
chronic immune activation due to frequent and repeated parasitic infection has been
suggested as the probable cause of the increased rate of HIV progression to AIDS and
the greater susceptibility to infection observed in sub-Saharan Africa as compared to
the developed countries [Medley et al., 1987, Bentwich et al., 1995, Weissman et al.,
1996].

Transient activation of the immune system occurs during infections and is a normal
response to immunization. Such activation can aﬀect the course of HIV infection. Nu-
merous studies have examined the consequences of vaccinating untreated HIV-infected
individuals. Stanley et al. [1996] found that giving a booster dose of tetanus toxoid
resulted in transient increases in plasma viremia in all 13 HIV-infected subjects stud-
ied. Staprans et al. [1995] found that inﬂuenza vaccination led to transient increases
of plasma HIV-1 RNA, and that patients with higher CD4 T-cell counts had larger
and more rapid increases in viral load. The large immunization-related increases in
virus observed by Staprans et al. [1995] suggest that increased viral replication is not
correlated only with antigen-speciﬁc T-cells, but that the activated inﬂuenza-speciﬁc
cells must have recruited other non-speciﬁc T-cell populations, which then became
targets for infection [Wahl and Orenstein, 1997].

Other studies using inﬂuenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccine have con-
ﬁrmed that vaccination can trigger increases in plasma HIV RNA [O’Brien et al.,
1995, Brichacek et al., 1996, Glesby et al., 1996, Rosok et al., 1996]. Thus a number
of data sets are available that illustrate a relationship between immune system ac-
tivation and changes in HIV viral load. This data presents an interesting challenge
to current mathematical models of HIV infection [Perelson et al., 1996, 1997; Nowak
and May, 2001]. In an early theoretical paper, McLean and Nowak [1992] examined
the eﬀects of infection with pathogens other than HIV as a cofactor in HIV progres-
sion. However, no quantitative data was available at the time for direct comparison
of model and theory. Here we return to this issue and construct a simple model of
HIV-infection and immune system activation via vaccination, and then compare the

1

model with data from the study of Stanley et al.[1996] in which 13 HIV seropositive,
asymptomatic individuals were vaccinated with tetanus toxoid.

2 A simple vaccination model

To understand the eﬀects of vaccination with a common recall antigen (tetanus toxoid)
on chronically infected, untreated HIV patients whose viral loads have reached steady
state, we modify what has become a standard HIV infection model [Perelson et al.,
1996, 1997]. The model includes uninfected, infected and chronically infected T-
cell populations, HIV and other antigens A. We assume that the vaccine–introduced
antigens, A, activate CD4+ T-cells. For simplicity, the model ignores latently infected
cells, which in untreated individuals are an extremely minor source of virus; Chun
and Siliciano [1997] estimate that only 1 in 105 T cells are latently infected. We also
do not separately consider vaccine-speciﬁc or HIV speciﬁc T-cell populations, since
this leads to a model with more parameters than the data reported by Stanley et al.,
[1996] will support.

The model, like that of McLean and Nowak [1992], includes a vaccine antigen A,
which we assume is eliminated from the body at a rate proportional to both the
antigen concentration and the CD4+ T cell density. The rate of proportionality γ
implicitly includes a factor that accounts for the fact that only a fraction of T cells
are antigen speciﬁc and accounts for complexities of the antigen speciﬁc, helper cell
dependent response that leads to antigen elimination.

Since individuals would be expected to vary with regard to the time of their last
tetanus vaccination, we assume that levels of antibody and T memory cells speciﬁc
for tetanus toxoid would also vary. In our model we avoid this level of detail, but
simply assume that the antigen clearance rate and parameters that determine the
rate of T cell activation vary for each patient.

The model we use is given by the following system of diﬀerential equations:

is cleared in a T cell-dependent manner with rate constant γ. Uninfected T cells, T ,
are produced at a rate λ, die at a rate d, and are infected by virus with rate constant
κ. In the presence of antigen, we assume T cells are activated into proliferation at a
maximum rate a, and that the proliferation rate depends on the antigen concentration
with a half-saturation constant K. K is thus the antigen concentration that drives
T cell proliferation to half its maximal value. Productively infected cells, T ∗, are
generated by infection of target T-cells T at a rate kV T , and die at rate δ, as in the
standard model [Perelson et al., 1996]. Chronically infected T-cells, C, are produced
from healthy susceptible T-cells at a rate αkV T , where α < 1. Thus, the production
of chronically infected cells occurs at a fraction of the rate of generating productively
infected cells. Chronically infected cells die at a rate µ, which we assume is less
than δ, so that chronically infected cells are longer-lived than productively infected
cells. Free virus, V , is produced by productively infected cells at average rate Nδ, by
chronically infected cells at rate Ncµ, and is cleared at rate c per virion. The model
parameters and their assumed values are given in Table 1.

Prior to vaccination, each patient was assumed to be in steady state with a known
baseline T cell count ¯T and viral load ¯V . The steady state productively infected and
chronically infected cell concentrations ¯T ∗ and ¯C, the infection rate constant k and
burst size N may be calculated from the following steady state equations, derived by
setting the left-hand sides of equations (2)-(5) to zero.

Parameters other than k and N were set as shown in Table 1. Note that with
these parameter choices, and the T cell and viral load levels in the patients studied by

Stanley et al., [1996] this model generally yields larger steady state levels of chronically
infected cells than of productively infected cells (Table 2).

At time t = 0, we assume a dose of antigen A0 was given in a vaccine, which
perturbed the steady state. We assume the same dose of vaccine was give to all indi-
viduals, and then measure the antigen concentration in each individual as a fraction
of the immunizing dose. This is equivalent to setting A0 = 1. We then numerically
solved the system of diﬀerential equations given by (1) - (5), with the initial con-
ditions A(0) = 1, and T , T ∗, C, and V set to their steady state value. For each
individual in the Stanley et al. [1996] study, the parameters K, a and γ were allowed
to vary so that the amplitude and timing of the response could be best matched to
the observed post-vaccination viremia.

3 Data and sampling

Stanley et al., (1995) studied 16 asymptomatic homosexual men seropositive for HIV-
1. The subjects were given an 0.5 ml tetanus booster intramuscularly or mock im-
munized (three seropositive subjects and four seronegative controls). No information
on prior vaccination history, i.e., date of last tetanus booster, or general quality of
health was given. It was noted that one patient developed cavitary pneumonia about
a month following vaccination.

The model was ﬁt to the data on viral load changes after vaccination for each
HIV-infected person studied by Stanley et al.
(1996). Using nonlinear regression
techniques, the best-ﬁt set of parameters were determined for each patient (Table 3).
During the course of the original study, viral load measurements were taken on days
0 (baseline), 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 approximately. The data sampling was too sparse
to determine the exact peak of viremia or the time the peak was attained. However,
Stanley et al. (1996) report the apparent peak and the time it was measured. In
addition, many patients had two post-immunization peaks in viremia. The greatest
peak in viremia was the earlier of the two observed peaks in patients 3, 5, 10, and 13,
and the second of two peaks in patients 1,4,7, and 11. Other patients had two peaks
of nearly equal amplitude [patients 2, 8, 9].

Of the patients with double post-immunization peaks in viremia, patients 1, 7, 8,
9 and 11 had peaks at days 7 and 21 (Figure 1), though in some of these cases the
earlier peaks can be classiﬁed as minor peaks or inﬂection points. Of those with single
observed post-immunization peaks, patients 3, 5, 10 and 13 have primary peaks at
day 7, and inﬂection points, shoulders, or minor peaks at day 28 (Figure 2).

4 Results

The amplitude and the approximate timing of the post-immunization maximum
viremia were matched in nine of twelve cases; in patients with double peaks of nearly
equal amplitude (i.e., patients 8, 9), the later peaks were matched. The eleven pa-
tients modeled are summarized below and in Tables 2 and 3.

4.1 Early peaks in Viremia

Patients with relatively high baseline CD4 T-cell counts (patients 5, 9, 10), as well
as those with high baseline viremia (patients 6, 9, 13) all had early peak viremia, at
either 3 days (patient 5) or 7 days (patients 6, 9, 10, 13) post-immunization. This
makes sense given the fact that high baseline T-cell counts yield a larger population
of activated target cells post-immunization: a vigorous early response by the immune
system ensures an early peak in viremia.

The “viremia factor”, or ratio of peak viremia to baseline viremia, given as Vf in
Table 2, was generally rather low for most patients, ranging between 2 and 4 (mean
= 2.92) for nine of twelve patients. Three remaining patients with unusually high
“viremia factor” ratios, patients 3 (Vf = 7.5), 4 (Vf = 7.0) and 10 (Vf = 35.7) also
had early peaks, though in patient 4 this was a minor inﬂection followed by peak
viremia at 21 days, whereas both patients 3 and 10 had single early peaks.

We were able to match well the amplitude and timing of peak viremia for patients
3, 6, and 10 (Figures 3, 4, and 5), all of whom had early peaks in viremia and were
best-ﬁt with relatively high antigen clearance rate constants, γ, in our simulations
(Table 3).

4.2 Double peaks in Viremia

Over half of the patients studied had multiple peaks in viremia, though often the ﬁrst
peak might be classiﬁed as ‘minor’. For patients with a minor early peak, usually
at 7 days, followed by a maximum in viral load at 21 days, we were able to ﬁt the
amplitude and timing of the maximum peak. Patients 1, 4, 7, and 11 exemplify this
behavior; results for patient 7 are shown in Figure 6. These patients were best-ﬁt
with γ values that were low relative to those given for patients with true early peaks
in viremia (Table 3).

Some patients experienced early and late peaks in viremia of equal or nearly equal
amplitude. Of the patients with double peaks in viremia, our model generally ﬁt the
later peaks at 21 days. These patients were assigned much lower clearance rates then
were the patients who experienced single early peaks in viremia. However, in patients
with double peaks (e.g., patients 8 and 9, Figures 7 and 8) ﬁts to the earlier peaks,
unobtainable with this model, might require higher values of γ.

4.3 T-cell - Antigen Interactions

The rate of antigen induced T-cell activation/proliferation is given in the model by
a( A
A+K ) [equations 2 and 7]. Recall that the antigen concentration has been eﬀectively
normalized, so that A ≤ 1. For patients 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11, K >> 1 (Table 3).
Thus the denominator in the T cell activation term is approximately equal to K, and
the activation/proliferation rate is ∼ a
K . Substituting in K and a values [Table 2]
for these patients yields rates ranging from 0.02 d−1 to 0.06 d−1 (mean 0.0278 d−1)
with most values clustered around 0.022 d−1. These patients all had low values for
the T-cell activation/proliferation term, and later peaks (21 days) in observed and
modeled viremia. Note that patient 5 had early observed viremia which we could not

6

model with this system, and the value of the ‘activation term’ for this patient reﬂects
the later peak in the modeled viremia.

Higher values of the activation term would increase the interaction between T-
cells and antigen A, resulting in swifter activation of T-cells and an earlier increase
in virus. For patients 2, 3, 6, and 10 of which we modeled 3, 6, and 10 successfully, A
and K were the same order of magnitude or within one order of magnitude in value,
and the approximation for the interaction term shown above does not hold. In this
case, interaction terms for these patients ranged from 0.375 d−1 to 3.4 d−1, which is
between one and two orders of magnitude greater than the interaction terms found
for the prior group of ‘late peaking’ patients. Patients 3, 6, 10 and 13 all had early
viremia, and relatively high values for the antigen clearance term γ.

5 Discussion and Summary

With a simple modiﬁcation of a standard HIV-infection model we were able to repro-
duce the general features of the post-vaccination rise in viral load seen by Stanley et
al. [1996]. Interestingly, more than half of the patients in this study had double peaks
in viremia. While assay variability might account for some of these peaks, in other
cases the peaks were suﬃciently large that this seems unlikely. For patients with
double peaks we were only able to ﬁt the later of the two peaks, which was often the
larger peak. When the peaks were of equal amplitude, we were again able to model
the second of the two peaks. These patients were assigned lower pathogen clearance
rates γ than patients with early single peaks in viremia, which we also successfully
modeled.

The fact that we could not approximate the earlier peaks in those patients with
double peaks in viremia suggests that our model may lack some features present in
the actual biology. For example, individuals vaccinated recently may have a larger
and more robust memory cell response than individuals vaccinated a long time in the
past. The two peaks may represent an early memory response followed by a naive cell
response. In individuals with little remaining memory, one may speculate that only
the later naive response would be observed. Another possible explanation for double
peaks is that the ﬁrst peak is due to stimulation and infection of tetanus speciﬁc
T cells, whereas the second peak is caused by the rise in viremia stimulating HIV
speciﬁc T cells, and then allowing these cells to be infected. Thus, our model might
beneﬁt from the addition of other populations of T-cells.

Modeling of this type would also beneﬁt from closer observation of patients: more
data points, at closer time spacing, and better information on vaccination history,
especially date of last tetanus booster.

Figure 1: Plot of patient data showing viral loads for patients experiencing two distinct peaks in
viremia at roughly 7 and 21 days. Patients 8 (in green line) and 9 (blue line) have equal or nearly
equal peaks at days 7 and 21, while patients 1, 7, and 11 (black, red, and yellow line respectively)
experience what was recorded as a minor peak at 7 days followed by a true peak at 21 days.

Figure 2: Plot of patient data showing viral loads for patients experiencing one early primary peak
in viremia at 7 days. Patients 3, 5, 6, and 10 are shown in black, red, green and blue line respectively.
Note that the curves for most of these patients show a post-peak ’shoulder’ at 21-28 days.

Figure 3: Modeled viral loads for patient 3 (solid red line) are shown compared with observed
viral loads (solid black line). Note that the sampling for the data is such that the data curve is
slightly asymmetric, and true peak may not be sampled. Modeled viral loads slightly overshoot the
observed, and modeled peak is somewhat later, but falls plausibly between two observations.

Figure 4: Modeled viral loads for patient 6 (solid red line) are shown plotted against observed viral
loads (solid black line). This patient experienced a second very late peak (42 days) associated with
known cavitary pneumonia, so data is truncated at 28 days. Note the asymmetry of the observed
primary peak in viremia.

slightly, though this misﬁt is probably within measurement error associated with the observations.

Abstract

A mechanism of memories, especially biological memories, is studied in terms of quantum ﬂuids.
Two-dimensional ﬂows in central potentials Va(ρ) = −a2gaρ2(a−1) (a 6= 0 and ρ =
x2 + y2) have
zero-energy eigenstates that degenerate inﬁnitely for all a. It is shown that stable standing waves
constructed from the zero-energy ﬂows are conﬁned in various types of polygons which can be the
minimum units of memory systems. Vortex patterns awoken in the units by stimuli correspond to the
memories of the stimuli. This memory system is not a system for preserving memories as usual but
that for awaking memories. The system has interesting properties; (i) the absolute economy as for the
energy consumption, (ii) the inﬁnite variety for a huge number of memories, (iii) the perfect recovery
of the system from any disturbances by stimuli, and (iv) the large ﬂexibility in the construction of
the system. A process for thinking is also proposed in terms of this memory system.

1. Introduction

Researches for the mechanism of brains are extensively going on from many diﬀerent experimental
and theoretical standpoints, and many interesting results have been reported. At present, however,
these approaches are still not enough to understand the mechanism of brains from the viewpoint of a
fundamental theory of physics. The ﬁrst step of the understanding seems to be the elucidation of the
mechanism of memories in brains as a physical process. The insides of our bodies are mainly occupied
by many kinds of ﬂuids, and the total uniﬁcation of many organs are also preserved mainly by such
ﬂuids.
It is not a peculiar idea that the mechanism in brains is governed by some kind of ﬂows of
such ﬂuids. In this sense it is quite natural that the dynamics of ﬂows (hydrodynamics) is one of the
fundamental dynamics in our bodies. On the other hand the dynamics in brains does not seem to
be a completely deterministic dynamics like classical dynamics, but some kind of probability seems to
play an important role in the mechanism of thinking. Considering the coexistence of the probability
and the fundamental principle of superposition in wave dynamics, we may invoke some kind of quantum
process related to hydrodynamics to describe the dynamics in brains. Such a hydrodynamical approach of
quantum mechanics was vigorously examined in the early stage of the development of quantum mechanics
[1-8], and then some fundamental properties of the quantum ﬂows like vortices were investigated [9-13].
Recently interesting solutions that have exactly zero-energy eigenvalue and degenerate inﬁnitely have
been found in two-dimensional quantum ﬂows [14-16]. From the viewpoint of the energy consumption
in the construction and the preservation of the mechanism of brains such zero-energy ﬂows can be very
useful tools. Furthermore the inﬁnite degeneracy can provide the inﬁnite variety of vortex patterns [15-
17] corresponding to a huge number of memories. Note that the vortices have recently been observed in
many phenomena such as condensed matters [18-20], non-neutral plasma [21-24] and Bose-Einstein gases
[25-29]. Here we show a possibility of the mechanism of memories in terms of the zero-energy ﬂows. It is
shown that the memory system proposed here is not a system for preserving memories as usual but that
for awaking memories, and it has quite suitable properties to represent biological memory systems.

E
the mass m and the coordinate vector (x, y) can represent not only those of the single particle but those
of the centre of mass for a many particle system as well [17]. It has also been shown that, as far as the
zero-energy eigenstates (ψ0) are concerned, the Schr¨odinger equations for all a can be reduced to the
following equation in terms of the conformal transformations ζa = za with z = x + iy;

is to say, the zero-energy eigenstates for all the diﬀerent numbers of a are described by the same plane-
wave solutions in the ζa space. Furthermore it is easily shown that the zero-energy states degenerate

and n. General forms of the polynomials have been obtained by using the solutions in the a = 2 case
(2D parabolic potential barrier (2D PPB)) [15, 16]. Since all the solutions have the factors e±ikaua or
e±ikava, we see that the zero-energy states describe stationary ﬂows [14, 15, 16]. Taking account of the
direction of incoming ﬂows in the ζa plane that is expressed by the angle α to the ua axis, the general
eigenfunctions with zero-energy are written as arbitrary linear combinations of eigenfunctions included
in two inﬁnite series of nψ

We brieﬂy comment on states having non-zero energy eigenvalues. Energy eigenvalues are in general
complex values, and the states with complex energies can be understood to be resonance states which are
not stable and decay in some time scale [30]. Exact solutions not only for zero-energy but for non-zero
energies as well have been solved in 2D PPB [14, 31]. Note here that we consider the motions of the z
direction perpendicular to the xy plane to be free motions represented by e±ikz z. We should, therefore,
notice that the total energies ET of the ﬂows are given by ET = Ez, where Ez are the energies of the
free motions in the z direction. We shall, however, not take account of the motions in the z direction in
the following discussions on the motions in the ζa plane.

i~

Note that the zero-energy eigenfunctions can not be normalized as same as those in scattering pro-
cesses [30]. Actually it has been shown that all the states for zero and non-zero energies are eigenstates
in the conjugate spaces of the Gel’fand triplets [13-16]. This fact means that the probability density
2) and the probability current (j(t, x, y) = Re[ψ(t, x, y)∗(
)ψ(t, x, y)]) lose the
ψ(t, x, y)

|
meanings. We, however, see that the velocity deﬁned by v = j(t, x, y)/ρ(t, x, y), can have the well-deﬁned
meaning, because the ambiguity arising from the normalization is cancelled in the deﬁnition. The velocity
was widely discussed in early stage of quantum mechanics [1-8]. It is also well-known that vortices appear
at the zero points of the density, that is, the nodal points of the wave functions [9-13]. Let us here remem-
ber the fact that the zero-energy states have the inﬁnite degeneracy, and therefore we can construct wave
functions having the nodal points at almost arbitrary positions in terms of linear combinations of the
zero-energy states. Actually various vortex patterns have been studied [15-17]. It should be emphasized
ga
that we can study the vortex problems for all Va(ρ) as a problem with the constant potential Va =
in the ζa plane, because the conformal transformations do not change fundamental properties of vortices
such as the numbers of vortices and the strengths of vortices Γ. In quantum mechanical phenomena it
ds is quantized such that Γ = 2πl~/m, where l is an integer
is shown that the circulation Γ =
[9-14]. Vortex patterns in the (x, y) plane can be obtained by the inverse transformations of the conformal
mappings [15, 16].

3. Standing waves and vortex patterns

Let us start with the study of zero-energy standing waves that will play an important role in the
n (ua; va), we can easily make two

our argument we pick up only four standing waves that are constructed in terms of the linear combinations

·

These wave functions can be conﬁned in quadrangles of the ζa plane, which are surrounded by rigid
fences described by inﬁnite potentials, because we can take zero as boundary values on the sides of
the quadrangles. For example ψcc = coskuua coskvua becomes zero on the lines where either kuua =
(2m + 1)π/2 or kvva = (2n + 1)π/2 (m and n are integers) is satisﬁed. In the cases where a are positive
integers the quadrangles in the ζa plane are represented by 4a-gons in the original xy plane. Now we get
the standing wave states conﬁned in the special regions which are described by the quadrangles in the ζa
plane. It should be noticed that the quadrangles have a wide variety of the sizes which are determined
by the numbers of wave lengths contained in the quadrangles. That is to say, the number Nu for the u
direction and that Nv for the v direction are free parameters, where Nu and Nv are positive integers or
positive half-integers.

Now let us discuss vortex patterns made from the zero-energy ﬂows. It is known that vortex patterns
are one of topological properties of ﬂows, and then they can be stable in many physical phenomena.
Following the above consideration, we can prepare many diﬀerent standing waves depending on the sizes
of quadrangles. The standing waves, of course, have no vortex, because j = 0. Let us study an example
of a quadrangle where a standing wave ψcc with Nu = 1/2 and Nv = 3/2 is conﬁned. We would like to
investigate what happens when a ﬂow is put into the quadrangle. Let us put a diﬀerent standing wave,
for example, the standing wave with the wave number vector ~q = (qu, qv), which is described by the wave
function ψsc = isinquua
cosqvva, into the quadrangle prepared. Note that in the process where the new
ﬂow is added we can use the free motions of the z direction. We see that the ranges of u and v in the
quadrangle are given by
3π/2kv. (Hereafter we omit the suﬃx a from
≡
ua, va, ka and etc.) The total wave function is written as

where C is taken to be a real number for the simplicity of the present discussion.
In order that the
inserted wave ψsc is stable in the quadrangle, the wave function of the inserted wave must vanish on the
boundaries of the quadrangle, that is, on the lines fulﬁlling
= vB. This constraint gives
us the relations

qu = 2(Lu + 1)ku and qv = (2Lv + 1)kv/3,

where Lu and Lv are zero or positive integers. Let us investigate vortices in the quadrangle. From the
fact that ψcc has two nodal lines fulﬁlling v =
vB/3 in the ζ plane and on the other hand ψsc has nodal
lines fulﬁlling u = nπ/qu or v = (2m + 1)π/2qv (n and m are integers), we see that vortices appear at
the nodal points of the total wave function (uV , vV ), where

and vV =

Considering the constraint

in the case of Lu = 0 two vortices appear at (0,

In general cases the following results are found out:
(I)In this vortex-formation process we ﬁnd out the selection rule for the inserted wave numbers ~q such
that only the waves with qu = (Lu + 1)ku/Nu and qv = (2Lv + 1)kv/2Nv can format some stable vortex-
patterns in the above example. In general the ratios of qu/ku and qv/kv must be rational numbers.
(II) From the observation of the number of the vortices we can read oﬀ the number Lu (or Lv).
Furthermore we can add one more important fact:

vB/3 for Lu > 0.

(III) In the processes putting standing waves into the quadrangle the number C that represents the mag-
nitude of the inserted wave play no role in the determination of the vortex patterns.

4. Mechanism of memories

Here let us consider the mechanism of memories in terms of the vortex-formation process. In the
present framework we consider that every vortex pattern corresponds to a memory. In this viewpoint a
quadrangle conﬁning a standing wave is not a memory corresponding to a special item, but the system in
which a vortex pattern is awoken by a ﬂow induced by a stimulus. A quadrangle can awake diﬀerent vortex
patterns corresponding to diﬀerent wave numbers expressed by the relations like qu = (Lu + 1)ku/Nu in
the example of the section 3. We may visualize the following process; a stimulus corresponding to an item
is taken by some organs and converted to ﬂows. The ﬂows reach at boundaries of many quadrangles with
diﬀerent sizes (4a-gons in the real space). Every quadrangle analyses the ﬂow in terms of the standing
waves given by (6). Notice that this analysis for the inserted ﬂow is nothing but Fourier analysis in the
vB for v. If the ﬂow does
ζa plane, of which boundaries are given by the lines u =
not contain the waves with the wave numbers ﬁtting to the selection rule (I), the ﬂow cannot make any
stable vortex pattern. Only the ﬂows containing the wave numbers ﬁtting to the rule (I) make stable
vortex patterns in the quadrangles. Thus one stimulus sent to many quadrangles awakes various vortex
patterns in those quadrangles. We may consider that the set of these vortex patterns made in the diﬀerent
quadrangles represents the memory corresponding to the stimulus. As noted in (III), the magnitude of
the stimulus does not aﬀect the vortex formation at all.

uB for u and v =

±

Let us see the characteristic features of this memory system. From the mechanical standpoint the
fundamental properties of a quadrangle are determined by the parameters of the potential inside the
quadrangle, that is, a and ga, where a determines the form (4a-gon) of the xy plane and ga does the
fundamental wave number ka. It must be noticed that further steps are needed for making a quadrangle
conﬁning a standing wave. One is the division of the fundamental wave number between two directions
v, that is, ~ka = (ku, kv) is the wave number vector in the
ua and va, following the relation k2
ζa plane. In order to determine the actual lengths of the sides of the quadrangle, we need one more step
for the decision of two numbers Nu and Nv which determine the lengths of the sides of the quadrangle.
Summarizing the above argument, the following three steps are needed to set up a quadrangle;

a = k2

u + k2

(1) the choice of a and ga (the determination of the potential inside the quadrangle),
(2) the division of ka between ku and kv (the determination of the wave vector ~ka conﬁned
in the quadrangle), and
(3) the choice of the numbers of the wave lengths contained in the quadrangle, Nu and Nv
(the determination of the lengths of the sides of the quadrangle).

Through these processes a quadrangle conﬁning a deﬁnite standing wave is determined. We see that in
these processes we have ﬁve parameters, that is, a, ga, Nu, Nv and one more parameter θa to determine
~ka such that ku = kacosθa and kv = kasinθa. The angle parameter 0 < θa
2π is a continuous free-
parameter, and therefore the two wave numbers ku and kv can be also continuous numbers limited by ka.
This fact means that from one fundamental wave number ka we can make quadrangles having arbitrary
values as for the ration of the lengths of two perpendicular sides, which is given by tanθa. Taking also
account of the free parameters Nu and Nv, we have large freedom to the determination of the sizes
and forms of quadrangles. We can, thus, provide quadrangles which can correspond to almost arbitrary
inserted wave number vectors ~q even if ~q must be satisﬁed by the selection rule given in (I) to make stable
vortex patterns in the quadrangles.

≤

Let us continue to discuss about the mechanism for making memories. As already noted, the quad-
rangles are not the mechanism for preserving memories but that for awaking memories. One quadrangle
characterized by a set of the four parameters ka, θa, Nu and Nv can fundamentally produce inﬁnite
numbers of diﬀerent vortex patterns corresponding to the diﬀerences of the wave numbers of the inserted
waves expressed by the relations qu = Luku/Nu and qv = Lvkv/Nv, where Lu and Lv are positive integers
or positive half-integers. It should once more be emphasized that one quadrangle awakes only one pattern

4

for a stimulus but the pattern corresponding to the stimulus is generally diﬀerent from others. Consider-
ing the limit of the discrimination of the vortex patterns, each quadrangle may have a certain maximum
values (Lmax) for Lu and Lv. In such a case, for the system where Nq number of quadrangles cooperate
we can roughly estimate the number (NV P ) of the diﬀerent vortex patterns that can be distingushed by
Lv,max)i is
the system as NV P =
10 and Nq is a large number, we obtain a huge number of the distinguishable vortex patterns counted
10Nq . Even if the mean number is 2 and Nq is not a very large number, e.g. 100, we still

have a huge number 2100

number of quadrangles is divided into many small blocks, and each block plays a fairly independent role
in the total system.

We would like here brieﬂy to note on the role of the higher order standing waves given in (5). Taking
account of the freedom introduced in linear combinations of those standing waves, we will ﬁnd out that
the boundary conditions are expressed by some complicated relations for ua and va. On the other hand,
from (5) we see that all the terms of the standing waves have one of the four factors coskuua, sinkuua,
coskvva and sinkvva. Therefore, as far as the discussions of vortex patterns are concerned, we can
perform arguments similar to those done in the lowest cases. In actual situations, however, the fences
of quadrangles (4a-gons in real spaces) will be made of some membranes in living beings. They are, of
course, not perfectly rigid. In such cases the wave functions do not generally vanish at the boundaries of
the quadrangles. Boundaries are, therefore, not given by strict quadrangles but by some deformed forms,
and the values of wave functions on the boundaries are not strictly 0 but some values determined by
the continuity conditions of wave functions. The inﬁnite degeneracy of the standing waves can possibly
play a role to solve the problem. That is to say, we will be able to provide various forms corresponding
to various boundary conditions in terms of the inﬁnite degeneracy. The vortex positions must also be
changed. By gathering the terms with the same factor (cos or sin) discussions similar to those done in
the lowest order cases will be also performed here. This inﬁnite degeneracy and the potential parameters
a and ga will bring a large ﬂexibility in the construction of the minimum units of the memory system.

5. Interesting properties of the system composed of the zero-energy ﬂows

We have used only the zero-energy states for making the memory system. We would like to point out

four interesting properties of the present system composed of the zero-energy ﬂows [17];
(i) the absolute economy as for the energy consumption in the construction of the memory system and
also the preservation of the system, where no ﬂow in the z direction should be taken, and therefore the
total energy ET = 0.
(ii) the almost inﬁnite variety of the vortex patterns provided for a huge number of memories, and
(iii) the perfect recovery of the memory system from shocks induced by stimuli, because the zero-energy
(ET = 0) states have no time dependence at all, and therefore the standing waves in the minimum units
of the system are perfectly recovered even if any disturbances induced by ﬂows decaying or diﬀusing in
some time scale are taken place [17].
These properties are suitable for interpreting the mechanism of memories in brains. That is to say, stimuli
taken in sense organs are analyzed in terms of the states including both of zero- and nonzero-energy states
in the conjugate spaces of Gel’fand triplets, and after some time scale only the zero-energy ﬂows selected
by the rule (I) remain in the minimum units and make stable vortex patterns. The vortex patterns are
sent to other places by the free motions of the inserted waves in the direction perpendicular to the xy
plane, and then every unit perfectly recover the initial state. We may point out one more important
property;
(iv) the large ﬂexibility due to the inﬁnite degeneracy and the parameters a and ga in the potentials is
provided in making the minimum units like the quadrangles.

6. A comment on thinking processes

5

Finally we would like to present a conjecture about thinking processes. At present we do not know
how the mechanism of memories presented here does work in thinking processes (algorithm of thinking
processes). We shall here point out a possibility that the memory system proposed here plays a role to
distinguish accustomed stimuli, which have been repeatedly experienced in the past, from many stimuli
included in an item caught by sense organs. We may consider that the same stimulus repeatedly given in
our experience provokes organizations in brains to make a memory system consisting of many minimum
units like quadrangles (possibly neurons in our brains) for selecting the very stimulus among many stimuli.
Some systems like autonomic nervous system are made in the womb of mother. Such a memory system
provided for the selection of some special stimuli will be made in a rather small block of the total system.
Now we can consider the following process for thinking: When an item is caught by some sense
organs, the stimuli taken by the organs will be gathered in a special place of brains, where the stimuli
are converted into signals that ﬁt to the detection by the memory system. From the place the signals
are delivered to many blocks, each of which consist of a certain number of minimum units. The signal
sent to one of the blocks are analyzed by each unit in the block in terms of the standing waves, and then
every unit selects the standing waves, following the selection rule (I). If there exist wave numbers ﬁtting
to the rule, the unit make a vortex pattern. Thus the signal sent to the block is converted to a set of
vortex patterns. This set represents a recognition of an accustomed experience. Thus the stimuli caught
by the organs are represented by a set of such recognitions . The recognitions characterized by various
vortex patterns are once more delivered to a certain number of new blocks (call them higher blocks)
and gathered together in each block. In this process the transportations will be carried out by using the
free motions of the direction perpendicular to the standing waves. It should be noticed that the vortex
patterns which are a kind of topological property can be very stable in such transportations. Then they
proceed to the next step carried out in the higher blocks, where interactions between vortices take place.
Some vortices will be created and/or annihilated [17], and a new vortex pattern appears in each block.
Such new patterns produced in the higher blocks will be sent to more higher blocks, where the higher
step is performed. The same processes will be repeated, until the brain gets a set of vortex patterns
that is recognized to be the ﬁnal answer. Such hierarchy may be the base of our thinking processes.
As we know, ﬂows of ﬂuids are very much ﬂexible and easily deformed, but not easy to control them
perfectly. Experiences and trainings in daily life must play a very important role in the construction of
this hierarchy. At present we have so many unkown problems such as the deﬁnite correspondence between
the vortex patterns and the recognitons, the dynamics in the higher blocks, and so on. We are still at the
entrance of the understanding. The view given here, however, is possibly an idea for the understanding
of thinking in terms of real physical processes.

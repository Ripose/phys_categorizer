The process of force generation by the growth of biopolymers is simulated via a Langevin-dynamics approach. The interaction
forces are taken to have simple forms that favor the growth of straight ﬁbers from solution. The force-velocity relation is
obtained from the simulations for two versions of the monomer-monomer force ﬁeld. It is found that the growth rate drops
oﬀ more rapidly with applied force than expected from the simplest theories based on thermal motion of the obstacle. The
discrepancies amount to a factor of three or more when the applied force exceeds 2.5 kT /a, where a is the step size for the
polymer growth. These results are explained on the basis of restricted diﬀusion of monomers near the ﬁber tip. It is also found
that the mobility of the obstacle has little eﬀect on the growth rate, over a broad range.

I. INTRODUCTION

The growth of biopolymers is a key ingredient in the
crawling motion and internal transport processes of al-
most all eukaryotic cells. They crawl among each other
and over substrates by motion of the cytoplasm into pro-
trusions known as lamellipodia, ﬁlopodia, or microspikes
according to their shapes. The forces driving the exten-
sion of these protusions are believed to comes from the
growth of a collection of ﬁbers assembled from monomers
of the protein actin. The actin ﬁbers are approximately
7 nm in diameter. With no opposing force, they can grow
at velocities [1] of over 1 µm/sec at physiological actin
concentrations [2,3] of 10–50µM; the velocities of the cell
protrusions are typically [4,5] in the range of 0.1 µm/sec.
Actin ﬁber growth also can power the motion of bacte-
ria and viruses through the cell cytoplasm. The veloci-
ties usually range from 0.02 to 0.2 µm/sec, but velocities
up to 1.5 µm/sec have been observed. As they move,
they leave behind “comet tails” made up of actin ﬁbers
[6,7]. Recent experiments have studied the minimal in-
gredients necessary for such propulsion. For example,
Ref. [8] shows that polystyrene beads coated with a cat-
alytic agent for actin polymerization spontaneously move
in cell extracts at velocities of 0.01 to 0.05 µm/sec, form-
ing comet tails similar to those caused by bacteria and
viruses.
It has also been shown recently that Listeria
and Shigella bacteria can move in a medium much sim-
pler than a cell extract, containing in addition to actin
monomers only the proteins Arp2/3 complex, actin de-
polymerizing factor, and capping protein. In particular,
myosin-type motors are not necessary for motion driven
by actin polymerization. The minimal ingredients lead
to velocities of 0.01 to 0.02 µm/sec; supplementation
of this mix with other ingredients including proﬁlin, α-
actinin, and the VASP protein increases the velocities

up to 0.05 µm/sec. To our knowledge, there have been
no measurements of the force-velocity relation for grow-
ing actin ﬁlaments. However, recent measurements of
the actin ﬁber density [9] and Young’s modulus [10] at
the leading edge of lamellipodia would suggest forces on
the order of 1 pN per ﬁber if all ﬁbers are contributing
equally; this is roughly equal to the basic force unit for
ﬁber growth, kT /a, where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T
is temperature, and a = 2.7 nm is the incremental ﬁber
length per added monomer.

Microtubules, which are thicker ﬁbers (22 nm) assem-
bled from tubulin subunits, also exert forces when they
grow. Microtubule assembly and disassembly is crucial
in intracellular processes such as mitosis, the formation
of cilia and ﬂagella, and the transport of nutrients across
the cell. Recent measurements [11] on microtubules in
vitro have yielded explicit force-velocity curves. At zero
force, the velocity is about 0.02 µm/sec; with increasing
force, the velocity drops oﬀ roughly exponentially.

It is clear that growth of the ﬁber against a force results
in a lowering of the system’s free energy if the opposing
force is suﬃciently small, since the exothermic contribu-
tion from the attachment of monomers at the end of the
polymer will outweigh the work done to move the ob-
stacle against the external force. The critical force at
which polymerization stops is determined by the balance
of these two contributions. However, it is not yet under-
stood in detail what factors determine the rate of growth
and the maximum force at which a useful speed can be
obtained. The basic diﬃculty of the polymer’s growth
process is that when the obstacle impinges directly on the
ﬁber tip, there is not enough room for a new monomer
to move in. Thus the rate of growth must be connected
to the ﬂuctuations of either the obstacle or the ﬁlament
tip, which create temporary gaps between the tip and
the obstacle. This eﬀect has been treated explicitly in

1

the “thermal ratchet” model [12]. In this model, one as-
sumes that the obstacle must be a critical distance a from
the tip for growth to occur. The ﬁber is assumed to be
rigid. The growth rate is obtained by solution of a drift-
diﬀusion type equation. For conditions of slow growth,
i.e. in which the time to add a monomer is much longer
than the time it takes the obstacle to diﬀuse a distance
a, this equation can be solved analytically. The forward
growth rate is proportional to the probability that the
obstacle-tip separation exceeds a. If depolymerization is
suﬃciently slow to be ignored, this yields the following
dependence of the velocity v on the opposing force F :

v ∝ exp (−F a/kT )

(1)

where k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the tempera-
ture. This result is equivalent to application of the prin-
ciple of detailed balance [13], on the assumption that
the depolymerization rate is independent of the oppos-
ing force. This work has been extended to ﬂexible ﬁbers
at non-perpendicular incidence [14,15], and to interacting
systems of ﬁbers [16]. For ﬂexible ﬁbers, it is again found
that the velocity is proportional to the probability form-
ing of a gap large enough to admit the next monomer.

It is the purpose of this paper to evaluate the force-
velocity relation for growing ﬁbers using a model more
realistic than those used previously. The model used to
derive Eq. (1) does not explicitly treat the diﬀusion of
monomers to the ﬁlament tip, but treats only the diﬀu-
sive behavior of the variable describing the distance be-
tween the obstacle and the tip. It is assumed that once
this distance exceeds a, that the monomers can enter
with a ﬁxed probability independent of the tip-obstacle
distance. This assumption needs to be evaluated by ex-
plicit treatment of the diﬀusion in the monomers.
In
addition, although the form of Eq. (1) is conﬁrmed by
the force-velocity relation for microtubules [11] the de-
cay rate of the velocity with applied force was about twice
as large as expected from Eq. (1). One possible expla-
nation of this, suggested by Mogilner and Oster [16], is
subsidy eﬀects between the thirteen ﬁbers comprising a
microtubule “protoﬁlament”. We intend to investigate
the extent to which other mechanisms can account for
such discrepancies.

II. MODEL

Our model system contains a ﬁber of protein monomers
growing perpendicular to a ﬂat rigid obstacle in two di-
mensions. We will be mainly interested in the actin sys-
tem, but the basic physics of our results is relevant to
any ﬁber growing against an obstacle. Our choice of two
dimensions is dictated mainly by computational practi-
cality: the simulations took over two weeks of CPU time
on a Compaq 21264 processor and our preliminary stud-
ies indicate that the three-dimensional simulations take
about 30 times longer. The fundamental units of the

simulation are the monomers; their internal and rota-
tional degrees of freedom are assumed to be included in
our eﬀective interaction energies. The motions of the
monomers and the obstacle are treated via Langevin dy-
namics. The z-direction is taken as the growth axis, with
the obstacle parallel to the x-direction. The coordinates
of the monomer centers-of-mass are given by ~ri, and the
z-coordinate of the obstacle is called Z. The Langevin
i d~ri/dt = − ~Fi + ~fi(t)
equations for this system are µ−1
for the monomers and µ−1
O dZO/dt = −FO + fO(t) for the
obstacle, where the µ’s are mobilities, F denotes deter-
ministic interaction forces, and ~fi and and fO are random
forces satisfying

.

(4)

and hfO(t)fO(t′)i = 2µ−1

O kT δ(t − t′)

The Langevin equations are implemented with a ﬁnite

time step ∆t following the procedure of Ref. [17]:

~ri(t + ∆t) = ~ri(t) + ∆tµi ~Fi(t) + ~g(t)pkT µi,

and Z(t + ∆t) = Z(t) + ∆tµO ~FO(t) + h(t)pkT µO , (6)

(5)

where ~g(t) and h(t) are random functions with zero time
average, satisfying
hgx(t)gx(t′)i = hgz(t)gz(t′)i = hh(t)h(t′)i = 2∆tδtt′

.

To implement the last set of correlations, at each time
step we choose gx, gz, and h from a uniform random
distribution random from −

√6∆t to √6∆t.

A. Force Laws

The obstacle experiences an external force of magni-

tude Fext in the −z direction.
In the absence of reliable force ﬁelds for the monomer-
monomer interactions, we use a simple model form for the
interactions which has a linear ﬁlament as the lowest-
energy structure. This form contains two-body and
three-body interactions. The two-body interactions are
repulsive and have the form

V2(rij ) = V rep exp [−κrep(rij − a)]

;

(8)

the three-body interaction energy has the form
V3(~rij , ~rik) = V att exp [−κatt(rij − a)]

exp [−κatt(rik − a)](α + cos θij )

,

(9)

with 0 < α < 1. It is attractive for θij > cos−1(−α).
The monomer-obstacle interactions have only a two-body
repulsive component, and have the form

W2(zi) = V obst exp (−κobst|zi − (Z − a)|)

.

(10)

2

The forces are obtained as gradients of these energy
terms. The energies are modiﬁed by subtraction of ap-
propriate constants to force the interaction energy to go
to zero at a cutoﬀ distance rmax (in the case of the three-
body terms this means that the energy vanishes if either
rij or rik becomes greater than rmax).

We use two parameter sets, whose values are given in
Table I. These two parameter sets are chosen mainly to
sample diﬀerent shapes of the “basin of attraction” for
the addition of a monomer, and by no means exhaustively
sample the range of possible model force ﬁelds. The ﬁrst
corresponds to a narrow basin of attraction. The large
value of α means that the three-body terms are positive
only for a small range of angles. This is partly compen-
sated for by the choice of prefactors to avoid the binding
energy becoming too small. We will call this the “hard”
force ﬁeld. The corresponding energy contours are shown
in Figure 1a. The width of the basin of attraction, or the
region over which the force pulls the next monomer into
its minimum-energy position, is about a tenth the size of
a monomer, which would correspond to a few ˚A for actin
monomers. Figure 1b shows the energy contours for the
parameters corresponding to a wider basin of attraction,
which is about a half the size of a monomer. We call
this the “soft” force ﬁeld. For both of the force ﬁelds,
the binding energies are very large compared to kT , so
that monomer subtraction from the ﬁber does not occur
in the simulations. This is a reasonable approximation;
from the measured on and oﬀ constants in Ref. [1], the
ratio of on to oﬀ rates at physiological actin monomer
concentrations would be less than 0.01.

With regard to the mobilities, the only physically rel-
evant factor is the ratio of the obstacle mobility to the
monomer mobility, since multiplicative changes in all the
mobilities simply serve to scale up the ﬁber growth ve-
locities; these will thus factor out of our velocity results,
which are scaled by 1/µkT . For most of our simula-
tions, we use a mobility of the obstacle equal to that
of the monomers for simplicity. This would correspond
to identifying the obstacle with a part of a ﬂuctuating
membrane, rather than an entire rigid particle. We have
varied the obstacle mobility in a few cases, with results
to be discussed below.

FIG. 1. Energy contours for monomer approaching ﬁber tip
with hard (a) and soft (b) force ﬁelds. Contour heights corre-
spond to integer multiples of kT , with lighter corresponding to
lower energies. The length units are nm, assuming a monomer
step size of 2.7 nm as for actin.

B. Filament-Growth Procedure

A typical physiological concentration of actin (10 µM)
is low in the sense that the average spacing between
actin monomers is about 60 nm, roughly 10 times the
monomer size. This means that the probability that
two free monomers are near enough to interact with each
other is very small. For this reason we adopt a growth
procedure in which only one free monomer at at time
interacts with the tip. This is accomplished as follows.
We start with a ﬁber of six monomers pointing in the z-
direction, at their equilibrium spacing. A free monomer
is then added at a point on a circle of radius R centered
on the next attachment site [18] (deﬁned as one monomer
spacing beyond the monomer at the ﬁber tip). We choose
R = 2.5a, which places the added monomer well beyond
the interaction range of the monomer at the tip. The rela-
tive probabilities of monomer addition at diﬀerent points
on the circle are proportional to exp [−W2(z)/kT ]. This
weighting is accomplished by choosing a random number
for each potential addition point; if this random number
is less than exp [−W2(z)/kT ], then this point is rejected
and another one is chosen. A new point is also chosen if
the monomer overlaps the ﬁber (i.e., its distance to the
ﬁber is less than rmax). The system is then stepped for-
ward in time according to the procedure described above,
until one of two possible termination events occur:

3

• 1. The monomer diﬀuses outside of the R-circle.
In this case it is restarted on the circle as above.
If the obstacle abuts the ﬁber, the position of the
monomer is constrained to be out of the interaction
range of the obstacle.

• 2. The monomer attaches to the tip. In this case,

another monomer is started on the R-circle.

In this way, the CPU time that is used in the simulation
is focused on the time that the monomers spend close to
the tip. A typical snapshot of a simulation conﬁguration
is shown in Figure 2.

velocities at other concentrations would be given by a
linear proportionality.

A. Force-Velocity Relation

Figure 4a shows growth velocity (solid circles) vs. ap-
plied force, for the “hard” force ﬁeld (cf. Figure 1a).
For comparison, a curve proportional to exp (−F a/kT )
is shown. The simulation results give noticeably lower
velocities at ﬁnite applied forces than the exponential
prediction. The discrepancy is about 65% at F a/kT =
1, and 85% at F a/kT = 2.5. The results can be
roughly ﬁtted to diﬀerent exponential curve, of the form
exp (−1.7 F a/kT ). Thus the growth velocity is much
more sensitive to force than the thermal-ratchet model
would predict. Figure 4b shows similar results for the
soft force ﬁeld (cf. Figure 1b). The free-ﬁber growth
velocity is about twice that for the “hard” force ﬁeld,
because the attraction basin is larger. The discrepan-
cies between the simulation results and the analytic the-
ory are comparable to those seen for the “hard” force
ﬁeld, but somewhat less pronounced. The discrepancy
at F a/kT = 2.5 is 70%, and the exponential ﬁt curve is
exp (−1.5 F a/kT ). The open diamonds in Fig. 4b corre-
spond to the results of varying the mobility µO; for the
leftmost one the mobility is doubled, and for the right-
most one it is reduced by a factor of ten. The eﬀects
of these variations are very minor, as predicted by the
“thermal-ratchet” model [12].

One can use the computed growth rates to predict
growth rates for low concentrations c, by simply mul-
tiplying the computed rates by the probability P (c) of
ﬁnding a monomer inside the R-circle. We obtain this
probability numerically as

P (c) =

1

c Zr<R

exp (−U (~r)/kT )d2r ,

(11)

where U (~r) is the energy (from both ﬁber and obstacle)
associated with placing a monomer at the point ~r, and the
coordinates are given with respect to the next attachment
point [19]. We plot our force-velocity relations in terms
of the force acting between the obstacle and the ﬁber tip.
This exceeds the external force applied on the obstacle
by an amount corresponding to the viscous drag on the
obstacle as it moves through the medium. The total force
is thus given as F = Fext + v/µO.

III. RESULTS

Our simulations involve 10 runs, each of which involves
the addition of 30 monomers to the ﬁber tip. This cor-

responds to a statistical uncertainty of p1/300 = 6% in

the growth velocities. Typical results for the ﬁber length
as a function of time are shown in Figure 3. Note that
there are no backwards steps, because the parameters
that are used in the force ﬁeld result in an exothermic
enthalpy for monomer addition that exceeds kT by at
least a factor of 20. We use a concentration correspond-
ing to one monomer per square of side 20a; in our model,

4

is proportional to the the length scale of the interaction
between the obstacle and the monomers. In a few cases,
we have made this length scale ﬁve times smaller, and the
velocities are unchanged to within a few percent. There-
fore, this monomer-obstacle interaction energy does not
seem to be the major factor, but rather the blocking ef-
fects of the obstacle.

FIG. 5. Energy contours for monomer approaching ﬁber
tip with hard force ﬁeld, in presence of obstacle. Contours
are as in Fig. 1.

To make this physical picture more precise, we have
calculated the velocities for model ﬁber conﬁgurations
in which the obstacle is held at a ﬁxed distance from
the ﬁber tip. The results are shown in Figs. 6a and b,
for the “hard” and “soft” force ﬁelds respectively. The
distance Z is measured in units of the monomer size, and
the edge of the obstacle is deﬁned as the point where
the monomer-obstacle interaction energy is equal to kT .
Thus when Z = 0, the interaction energy of the last
monomer in the ﬁber with the obstacle is kT . In both
cases, the velocity at Z/a = 1 is nearly zero. Only for
Z/a > 2 is the velocity within 20% of the free-growth
velocity.

The appropriate generalization of Eq. (1) is then the

following:

v(F ) = Z ∞

0

v(Z)P (Z, F )dZ ,

(12)

where F is the applied force, Z is the obstacle position,
and P (Z, F ) = (const) exp (−E/kT) is the probability
of a certain value of Z. Here the obstacle-ﬁber inter-
action energy is E = W2(z − Z) + F Z, where z is the
z-coordinate of the last monomer in the ﬁber. Equa-
tion (12) reduces to Eq. (1) if v(Z) has the form of a step
function beginning at a Z = a, and W2 is suﬃciently
short-ranged. The dashed lines in Figs. 4a and 4b cor-
respond to a numerical evaluation of Eq. (12). For both
force ﬁelds, the agreement with the simulation results is
quite close, with only about 20% discrepancies occurring
for small but non-zero forces. Thus the gradual rise of
the velocity seen in Fig. 6, as opposed to an abrupt jump,
is at the heart of the observed eﬀect.

B. Interpretation

We believe that the discrepancies seen in Fig. 4 re-
sult from the restriction of monomer diﬀusion to the
ﬁber tip by the impinging obstacle. Such restriction
will occur even when the obstacle is elevated by a dis-
tance a or more. Figure 5 shows energy contours for a
monomer approaching the tip, when the obstacle is ele-
vated a distance 1.25a relative to its equilibrium position
for F a/kT = 1.0. The contours at at integer multiples
of kT . The easily accessible paths corresponding to en-
ergies less than kT are conﬁned to a narrow band by
the presence of the obstacle. This is expected to slow
the diﬀusion to the tip. Eﬀectively, the monomers must
travel through a tunnel in order to get to the basin of
attraction near the tip. Another possible explanation
for the observed eﬀect would be that even in the region
with energy less than kT , there is a ﬁnite energy from
the interaction with the obstacle. However, this energy

validity of the assumptions underlying such simulations.
Because the bead-motion simulations include only the
thermal energy required to achieve a certain tip-obstacle
spacing, it is likely that the addition rate will drop oﬀ
more rapidly with increasing force than is assumed in
Ref. [20].

The results obtained here are also expected to have no-
ticeable results on the structure of membranes that are
being pushed forward by collections of actin ﬁbers. As
a result of random ﬂuctuations, some ﬁbers will eventu-
ally get ahead of others, and these will be exerting larger
forces on the membrane. If the velocity drops oﬀ rapidly
with the force, then these ﬁbers will be slowed down sig-
niﬁcantly. This will result in the membrane surface being
smoother than otherwise expected. Future work should
treat such many-ﬁber eﬀects, and also explore the eﬀects
of ﬁber growth angle and branching.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The physics underlying the above results is general
enough that in most systems involving ﬁber growth
against an obstacle, one should expect a decay of velocity
with applied force more rapid than the simple exponen-
tial form (1). This may explain some of the discrepan-
cies pointed out in connection with the measured force-
velocity relation of Ref. [11]. However, our application
to microtubule growth is not quantitative enough to de-
termined whether the present eﬀect exceeds the subsidy
eﬀects discussed in Ref. [16]. The results obtained here
should be useful in explaining the basic physics of motion
based on actin polymerization. For example, in a recent
study van Oudenaarden and Theriot [20] have simulated
the propulsion of plastic beads in cell extracts with a
model based on a number of ﬁbers exerting forces on the
beads. In their simulations, an assumed form is taken for
the probability of monomer addition to a ﬁber in terms
of the time-averaged position of the ﬁber relative to the
bead, or equivalently the force acting between the two.
A better knowledge of the relationship between the force
and the monomer addition rate can help pin down the

[18] In order to avoid an excessive number of excursions back
and forth across the circle radius, the added monomer is
placed a small distance inside R.

[19] In two dimensions, the time for a particle to diﬀuse to cap-
ture is not strictly proportional to the area of the region
in which it diﬀuses, but contains logarithmic corrections.
Therefore the calculated velocities are not strictly indepen-
dent of R. I have veriﬁed by use of a few test cases with
larger values of R that the predicted logarithmic scaling
is observed. Extrapolating to a value of R corresponding
to a physiological interparticle spacing for actin monomers
would modify the calculated velocities by a constant factor
of about two, which we have not included because our fo-
cus is the force-dependence of the velocity rather than its
absolute magnitude.

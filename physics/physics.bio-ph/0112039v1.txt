(Dated: September 28, 2013)

The mutation and selection of regulatory DNA sequences is presented as an unique model system
of molecular evolution where genotype, phenotype, and ﬁtness can be explicitly and independently
characterized. In this theoretical study, we construct an explicit model for the evolution of regula-
tory sequences, making use of the known biophysics of the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA
sequences, under the assumption that ﬁtness of a sequence depends only on its binding aﬃnity to
the regulatory protein. The model is conﬁned to the mean ﬁeld (i.e., inﬁnite population size) limit.
Using realistic values for all parameters, we determine the minimum ﬁtness advantage needed to
maintain a binding sequence, demonstrating explicitly the “error threshold” below which a bind-
ing sequence cannot survive the accumulated eﬀect of mutation over long time. The commonly
observed “fuzziness” in binding motifs arises naturally as a consequence of the balance between
selection and mutation in our model.
In addition, we devise a simple model for the evolution
of multiple binding sequences in a given regulatory region. We ﬁnd the number of evolutionar-
ily stable binding sequences to appear in a step-like fashion for increasing ﬁtness advantage, if
multiple regulatory proteins can synergistically enhance gene transcription. We discuss possible
experimental approaches to resolve open questions raised by our study.

Introduction

The regulation of gene expression involves many diﬀer-
ent proteins known as transcription factors which bind
passively to speciﬁc sites on the genomic DNA (see, e.g.
Gerhart and Kirschner (1997)). In bacteria, each such
site (called ‘operator’) typically consists of a contiguous
sequence of 20 − 30 nucleotides which binds a speciﬁc
transcription factor with much higher aﬃnity than would
a random DNA sequence of comparable length (Stormo
and Fields, 1998; von Hippel, 1979). Known examples
of diﬀerent operators for the same factor usually diﬀer
from the maximum aﬃnity binding sequence in a num-
ber of positions, typically in as many as 20% to 30%
of the signiﬁcant positions that contribute most to the
speciﬁcity of the interaction. The ensemble of viable
binding sequences is collectively referred to as the bind-
ing “motif” for a factor; its “fuzziness” creates a diﬃcult
computational problem for the prediction of binding sites
via informatic methods (see, e.g., Lawrence et al. (1993);
Stormo and Hartzell (1989); and references therein). In
many known cases, a single regulatory region contains
multiple operators for the same factor, each of which de-
viates from the maximum aﬃnity binding sequence.

Why are the motifs fuzzy? One possible scenario is
that the binding aﬃnity of each operator is tuned evo-
lutionarily to maximize the function of each regulated
gene or operon. An alternative scenario is that the func-
tion is insensitive to the detail of the binding aﬃnity
as long as it is above some threshold.
In the former
case, fuzziness in the binding arises due to the partic-
ular distribution of functional requirment. In the latter
case, binding sequences in diﬀerent regulatory regions are
deemed “equal”, and fuzziness results from maximizing
the sequence “entropy”. While anecdotal examples of
both cases are known, understanding whether either case

dominates in biology is of interest not only for its own
sake, but also very important for the choice of proper
informatics tools for motif ﬁnding. In this paper, we de-
scribe a detailed theoretical study of the latter case from
an evolutionary perspective, recognizing that as with any
other portion of the genome, the binding sequences are
subject to the opposing forces of mutation and selection
over evolutionary timescales. In particular, we address
the quantitative question of how large a selective advan-
tage the presence of a binding motif needs to provide,
in order to guarantee its survival against mutations, and
how large an advantage before multiple motifs are justi-
ﬁed. To make the study concrete and explicit, we will
mostly conﬁne the discussion to gene regulation in bac-
teria or phages, and focus on the binding of one speciﬁc
transcription factor to its operator(s) in the regulatory
region of one speciﬁc gene or operon. We will not treat
the interactions among diﬀerent factors, since in bacteria
such as E. coli, the majority of genes are regulated by a
single factor (Gralla and Collado-Vides, 1996).

Another motivation for our study is that the evolu-
tion of transcription factor binding motifs seems to be
a well-suited starting point for an attempt to establish
a link between the microscopic molecular mechanisms in
the cell and the “macroscopic” principles of evolution: In
general, the most important ingredient in an evolution-
ary study is to relate the genotype on which mutation
acts to the ﬁtness of the organism on which selection
acts through some quantiﬁable phenotype. This relation
is particularly simple for the operator binding problem
at hand, where a natural choice of the phenotype is the
binding probability of the transcription factor to the op-
erator. Regardless of whether the factor acts as an acti-
vator by attracting a polymerase to transcribe the gene,
or as a repressor to block transcription, it can function
only when it is bound to its operator. The fraction of

time an operator is occupied in equilibrium is given by
the binding probability. To regulate the transcription of
the gene, e.g., in reaction to a change in the environmen-
tal conditions or in order to trigger a diﬀerent phase of
the cell cycle, the cell changes the factor-operator bind-
ing probability by varying the concentration of the (ac-
tivated) factor inside the cell. The concentration may
vary from practically zero in the “OFF-state” to typi-
cally several hundred copies per cell in the “ON-state”.
We will make the reasonable (but critical) assumption
that the ﬁtness gain an operator contributes to the or-
ganism depends solely on the binding probability P in
the ON-state, with the value of P itself determined by
the actual sequence of the operator through the binding
energetics.

For a few exemplary transcription factors, the vari-
ation in binding aﬃnity upon mutation of the binding
sequence has been studied in great detail experimen-
tally (Fields et al., 1997; Oda et al., 1998; Sarai and
Takeda, 1989; Takeda et al., 1989). In particular, Fields,
Stormo, and coworkers have shown for the case of the mnt
repressor that its binding (free) energy is approximately
a sum over independent contributions from each of the
nucleotide positions in the binding sequence (Fields et
al., 1997). Typically, only 10 ∼ 15 positions in a bind-
ing site have a strong preference for speciﬁc nucleotides,
while the other positions do not contribute signiﬁcantly
to the binding energy. Known binding sequences display
a fuzziness of up to 3 ∼ 4 mismatches in these signiﬁ-
cant positions. A useful simpliﬁed ‘two-state model’ for
transcription factor binding is obtained by taking only
the signiﬁcant bases into account and assigning to each
of them the same binding energy ε, i.e. a match (to the
optimal binding sequence) is favored by an energy diﬀer-
ence ε over a mismatch. This model, introduced long ago
by von Hippel and Berg (1986), takes into account the ef-
fect of sequence-speciﬁc binding by a single parameter ε,
without reference to detailed binding energies which have
not yet been measured for most transcription factors.

Based on the two-state model and our assumption on
the contribution of the binding of the factor towards ﬁt-
ness, we construct an explicit theory for the evolution of
the binding sequences. Within the mean-ﬁeld approach
originally proposed by Eigen in the context of quasis-
pecies evolution (Eigen, 1971; Eigen et al., 1989), we
characterize the balance between the opposing forces of
selection and mutation quantitatively. We determine the
critical selection pressure needed to keep a motif from
mutating away, and show how the fuzziness in the motifs
arises naturally above the selection threshold. We further
apply the theory to investigate the frequently observed
occurrence of multiple motifs in a given regulatory region,
and elaborate on various plausible causes. Towards the
end, we will provide extended discussions on experimen-
tal approaches to pursue the open questions suggested by
this study.

Model and Equations

We focus on the operator sequence located in the reg-
ulatory region of a gene of interest. By assumption, this
gene is regulated by a single transcription factor. Let
~S = {S1, S2, ..., SL} denote the L signiﬁcant nucleotides
of the operator which specify transcription factor bind-
ing. We will keep the alphabet size, A, as a variable
in our equations, since, as we will see below, this facili-
tates the intuitive understanding of certain dependencies;
however A = 4 and Si ∈ {A, C, G, T} is the only case of
interest here. To describe the evolution of ~S in a popula-
tion of bacteria or phages, we need to specify the action
of selection and mutation.

Selection mechanism

It should be clear that gene regulation is only needed
in the presence of a changing cellular state, triggered ei-
ther internally, e.g. cell cycle, or externally through a
change in the environment. Hence to study the ﬁtness
of a regulatory mechanism, we must invoke at least two
diﬀerent states. Selection arises when the growth rate
of an organism depends on the probability P~S that the
factor binds to the sequence ~S in the state that prefers
factor binding (the “ON-state”). For the sake of con-
creteness, let us consider an environment that oscillates
between two states. We assume that in State A (the ON-
state), the environment induces a certain concentration
of activated factors, say on average NT F factors per cell
(these may either be produced upon entering State A, or
preexisting factors may be activated for binding by induc-
ers that cause an allosteric transition). Let the growth
rate or “ﬁtness” of the organism in this state be φA if
the factor is never bound (binding motif not present),
and φA + δφA > φA if the factor is always bound (see
Table 1). When the environment is in State B (the OFF-
state), let the ﬁtness be φB if the factor is never bound
and φB − δφB < φB if the factor is always bound. In
the following we will assume that the concentration of
activated factors in State B is practically zero, so that
the operator is never occupied (hence the parameter δφB
does not enter our model).

An example for the general situation described above
could be the binding of the lac-repressor to its operator
in the lac-operon of E. coli. In this case, the ON-state
would be the glucose-rich environment, and the OFF-
state would be the glucose-poor and lactose-rich envi-
ronment. φA,B would be the growth rate of E. coli in
the two environments in the absence of the lac-repressor.
δφA would be the increment in ﬁtness when the unnec-
essary lac-operon is turned oﬀ, and φB − δφB ≈ 0 is the
deleterious situation when lactose is present as the main
source of sugar but the lac-operon is not operative due
to the undesirable binding of the repressor.

In this study, we will discuss mainly the time-averaged

eﬀect on evolutionary time scales which much exceed the
time scales of cellular or environmental ﬂuctuations. We
choose τ / ln 2 as our unit of time, with τ denoting the
average generation time in the absence of the factor, so
that the time averaged growth rate there can be set to
1. Given the binding sequence ~S, and assuming that the
cell can quickly adjust the cellular concentration of the
factor1 so that the operator is occupied with probability
P~S in the ON-state and never occupied in the OFF-state,
the time averaged growth rate Φ ~S can be expressed as

Φ ~S = 1 + α · P~S .

(1)

Here, α is a dimensionless parameter which characterizes
the selection pressure on the binding sequence ~S. In the
limit α ≪ 1, there is hardly any selection pressure on the
sequence at all; the opposite limit α → ∞ corresponds to
the case where the failure of the factor-operator binding
is lethal to the organism.
If the fraction of time the
bacteria population encounters environment A is f , the
selection pressure becomes

α ≡ f · δφA .

(2)

In an experiment, α can be adjusted according to Eq. (2)
by changing the fraction of time f the ON-state is pre-
sented. Below, we will investigate the statistics of the
selected sequence ~S for a wide range of α’s.

Mutation process

We consider only single-nucleotide substitutions, and
focus on mutations in the binding sequence ~S, assuming
that the net result of mutation and selection on the rest
of the genome gives the overall background ﬁtness of 1

1 In the present article, we do not consider the ‘search problem’ of
how a transcription factor locates its operator among millions of
other sites on the DNA (see Berg et al. (1981); Winter and von
Hippel (1981); Winter et al. (1981) for a thorough experimental
and theoretical investigation of this problem, and Moroz, Ger-
land, and Hwa (2001, manuscript in preparation) for a bound
on the speciﬁcity of the protein-DNA interaction that results
from the requirement of reasonable search times). Rather we
treat protein-DNA binding as an equilibrium process character-
ized only by the binding probability. This is justiﬁed by the fact
that the search time is typically on the order of 1 min, which
is much smaller than the characteristic time scale of changes in
gene expression.

(with our time unit of τ / ln 2). Furthermore, we neglect
the diﬀerence between transversions and transitions, and
assume a constant rate ν0 at which a base mutates into
any other base. The total mutation rate of a site of length
L is then ν = ν0 L. For bacteria such as E. Coli, ν0 is
on the order of 10−9 under normal conditions and hence
ν ∼ 10−8. The mutation rate is larger for RNA viruses
which rely on the less accurate reverse transcriptase for
replication. For that case, ν0 is in the range 10−5 to 10−4
and hence ν ∼ 10−4 − 10−3.

Binding probability

P

As mentioned above, the binding (free) energy E~S of
the transcription factor to the binding sequence ~S is
given, to a good approximation, by a sum over indepen-
dent contributions from each nucleotide at the L signif-
icant positions (Fields et al., 1997; Stormo and Fields,
L
i=1 εi(Si). Each of these positions
1998), i.e. E~S =
typically prefers a particular nucleotide by a binding en-
ergy of several kBT ’s (we exclude from ~S those positions
which contribute only a fraction of kBT towards the to-
tal binding energy). Furthermore we adopt the ‘two-state
model’ (Berg and von Hippel, 1987; von Hippel and Berg,
1986), by assuming that each εi(Si) can only take on two
possible values, 0 if Si matches the preferred base S∗
i ,
i ).
or ε > 0 for a mismatch, i.e. εi(Si) = ε · (1 − δSi,S∗
The binding energy of a site ~S is then only a func-
tion of the number of mismatches, or Hamming distance
r~S = |~S − ~S∗|, from the optimal binding sequence ~S∗,
i.e.2,

E~S = E(r~S) = r~S ε .

(3)

Given its binding energy, the average occupancy of a site
is determined by equilibrium thermodynamics. Since a
binding site can only be occupied or unoccupied (but not
multiply occupied), its binding probability P~S = P (r~S)
is given by a Fermi function,

P (r) =

1
1 + eε(r−r0)/kB T ,

(4)

where µ = ε r0 is the chemical potential for the transcrip-
tion factors in the ON-state (this function is plotted in
Fig. 1 (right) with realistic parameter values).

In total, we are left with three dimensionless param-
eters for the two-state model of protein-DNA binding:

2 Note that the approximate linear relationship between the bind-
ing energy and the number of mismatches, Eq. (3), breaks down
when E reaches a certain non-speciﬁc binding energy Ens (Win-
ter et al., 1981). Beyond this point, the binding energy remains
constant. However, the expression (4) nevertheless provides an
useful description of the binding probability over the entire range
0 ≤ r ≤ L, since P (r) is essentially zero when E = Ens.

L, ε/kBT , and r0. As mentioned before, the number of
signiﬁcant positions in a binding site is typically in the
range 10 ≤ L ≤ 15. By inspection of the known binding
energies for exemplary transcription factors (Fields et al.,
1997; Oda et al., 1998; Sarai and Takeda, 1989; Takeda et
al., 1989), we ﬁnd the mean speciﬁcity of the signiﬁcant
sites to be typically ε = 1 ∼ 3 kBT . In (Moroz, Gerland,
and Hwa, 2001, manuscript in preparation), it is argued
on rather general ground that this is actually the opti-
mal range of ε for the transcription factors. The chemi-
cal potential µ depends directly on the average number
of factors NTF in the cell; the work of Moroz, Gerland,
and Hwa (2001, manuscript in preparation) suggests
that it can be approximated by µ ≈ µ0 + kBT ln[NTF],
where µ0 represents the binding free energy of a sin-
gle factor to the rest of the genome. For those factors
whose binding energies εi(Si) have been measured, we
ﬁnd µ0 ≈ −0.8kBT (mnt) and µ0 ≈ −1.9kBT (lambda-
repressor and cro). Hence, µ ≈ kBT ln[NTF]; see Fig. 1
for details. For ε = 2kBT and NTF = 50 ∼ 5000, we get
r0 = µ/ε = 2 ∼ 4.3. Clearly, r0 is the parameter that we
have the least information about; but we see that it has
a limited range, and in any case, most of our qualitative
conclusions will be insensitive to the speciﬁc choice of r0.
[Note that the above analysis is for factors that have a
binding site only in a single regulatory region. For those
factors which are global regulators and have many op-
erators located throughout the genome (e.g., the factor
CRP in E. coli), the number NTF above needs to be ap-
propriately adjusted by the number of operators (A.M.
Sengupta and B.I. Shraiman, 2001, submitted for publi-
cation).]

Evolution equation

In this study, we will focus on the steady-state proper-
ties of the mutation/selection process deﬁned above. For
large population size and close to the steady-state, we
may consider only the dynamics of the average popula-
tion and neglect ﬂuctuations due to the discreteness of
the individual organisms. We denote the average num-
ber of individuals at time t with binding sequence ~S by
N ~S(t). The time evolution of N ~S(t) is described by

∂
∂t

N ~S(t) =

ν0
A − 1

N ~S′(t) δ| ~S− ~S′|,1 +

X~S′

− ν N ~S(t) + Φ~S N ~S(t) .

(5)

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side describes the mu-
tational ﬂow into N ~S from all sequences ~S′ that are a
single-nucleotide mutation away, while the second de-
scribes the reverse process. The third term represents the
(time-averaged) selection/ampliﬁcation process. Eq. (5)
is similar to the “para-muse model” considered in a pop-
ulation genetics context by Baake et al. (1997).

Since the ﬁtness function (1) depends on the sequence
~S only through the binding probability P~S, which de-
pends only on the number of mismatches r according to
Eq. (4), it is advantageous to introduce a ‘radial distribu-
tion’ N (r, t) in the (discrete) Hamming distance space,

N (r, t) =

N ~S(t) δr, | ~S− ~S∗| .

(6)

X~S

With φ(r~S) ≡ Φ ~S denoting the ‘radial ﬁtness’ function,

is a mesa-shaped ﬁtness landscape. Eq. (7) is obtained by
observing that there are (L − r)(A − 1) ways to mutate a
site with r mismatches into a site with r+1 mismatches,
r ways to mutate it into a site with r − 1 mismatches,
and r(A − 2) ways to mutate a position that is already a
mismatch into a diﬀerent mismatch.

We will characterize the predictions of our model
by numerically integrating the discrete radial evolution
equation (7) using the set of realistic parameters given
above. However, to gain insight about the qualitative
behavior of the model, we also analyze the continuum-
space evolution equation obtained in the limit of large
L,

(9)

where we used n(r, t) and ϕ(r) to denote the continuum
generalization of the functions N (r, t) and φ(r) respec-
tively. Note that the mutational dynamics is locally con-
servative, with a local current j(r, t) = D(r) ∂rn(r, t) −
v(r) n(r, t). The appropriate boundary conditions are
j(0, t) = 0 and j(L, t) = 0.

The continuous radial evolution equation (9) reduces
the evolutionary dynamics to a simple one-dimensional
drift-diﬀusion equation, where the ‘diﬀusion coeﬃcient’
D(r) and the ‘drift velocity’ v(r) are explicitly given by

Note that both D and v are proportional to the over-
all mutation rate ν = ν0L, with only weak dependence
on r for r ≪ L. The drift velocity drives the distribu-
tion away from the optimal binding site at r = 0, simply
because the number of sequences with a ﬁxed number
of mismatches r increases quickly with r. This purely
entropic bias changes sign at (A − 1)L/A, which is the
average number of mismatches in a random binding se-
quence. Also note that the r-dependence of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient disappears when A = 2, because for a two-
letter alphabet, every mutation implies a change in r.
For A > 2, there are mutations which do not change the
Hamming distance and hence do not aﬀect the diﬀusion
process. This eﬀect is reﬂected in the reduction of D in
Eq. (10).

Our continuous radial evolution equation (9) is some-
what reminiscent of the evolution equation in ﬁtness
space introduced by Tsimring, Levine, and Kessler
(Tsimring et al., 1996) in a general population genetics
context. However, with our concrete model for protein-
DNA binding, we can work directly in genotype space,
which will enable us to make explicit predictions on the
behavior of the binding sites.

Selection threshold and fuzzy motifs

In this section, we use the evolutionary model (7) de-
scribed in ‘Model and Equations’ to address the following
questions: How large a selection pressure is needed for
the maintenance of binding motifs? And can the fuzzi-
ness of the motifs be accounted for by the balance be-
tween mutation and selection? We will ﬁrst provide an
analytical solution to a simpliﬁed continuum model, and
then show by numerical simulation that the qualitative
features of the solution hold even for small system such
as L = 10. We will compare these results to available
data and discuss experimental ramiﬁcations.

Analytical results

5

Various properties of the continuum model speciﬁed
by Eqs. (9-11) can be obtained exactly3. Here, we will
present the results and discuss various qualitative fea-
tures of the solution, in particular, the existence of a crit-
ical selection pressure for the maintenance of the binding
motifs. Even though the continuum model is meaningful
only for L ≫ r0 ≫ 1, we will see from numerical sim-
ulation that the qualitative features are valid even for
the more realistic parameter range where r0 is not much
larger than one, and L ∼ 10.

For the analytical study, we neglect the r-dependence
of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient (10) and the drift velocity (11),
and use D = ν/2, v = ν. This is justiﬁed as long as
r0 ≪ L since as we will see, most of the interesting “ac-
tion” of this system occurs around r = r0. Eq. (9) then
reduces to the asymmetric “quantum well” problem well
studied in the context of various statistical mechanics
problems (Hatano and Nelson, 1997). [It diﬀers from the
DNA unzipping problem studied by Lubensky and Nel-
son (2000) only by an (unimportant) boundary condition
at r = 0.] An explicit solution can be obtained by further
approximating the Fermi function (4) by the Heavyside
step function θ(r), such that the ﬁtness landscape be-
comes

φ(r) = 1 + α θ(r0 − r).

(12)

The solution of this simpliﬁed continuum problem is of
the form n(r, t) = n0(r)eγt, where n0(r) is the station-
ary distribution associated with the largest growth rate
γ. It is controlled by one dimensionless parameter, the

A phase transition occurs at

αc where the station-
ary distribution switches from being mostly conﬁned in
the region r < r0 (localized phase) to the binomial dis-
tribution (delocalized phase) when λ approaches 1. This
phase transition belongs to the same class of transitions
as the one described by Eigen in the context of quasi-
species evolution (Eigen, 1971; Eigen et al., 1989). The
critical selection pressure αc ∼ ν0 · L is recognized as
the well-known form of the “error threshold”. Note also
the dependence of αc on r0 as given in Eq. (14): αc de-
creases upon increasing r0, and since λ is a monotonously
increasing function of α − αc, the eﬀective growth rate γ
will also increase. This implies that a wider ﬁtness land-
scape has a smaller mutational load and a larger eﬀective
ﬁtness; see also the discussion by Wilke et al. (2001) in
a diﬀerent context.

Numerical results

In order to test whether the behavior derived above
for the simpliﬁed continuum model holds approximately
also for the discrete model (7) with realistic parameters,
we performed a number of numerical studies. We deter-
mined the steady-state distribution N0(r) of Eq. (7) over
α for two sets of parameters: (a) a
a range of values of

5 In the context of protein folding, it has been pointed out by R.
Goldstein that the balance of mutation and selection may lead to
maximal fuzziness in the space of amino acid sequences (Gold-
stein, 2001). Our results are similar in spirit, but more explicit
due to the simplicity of the protein-DNA binding.

6 It should be noted that both the critical value

αc and the di-
αc are modiﬁed if one explicitly includes
vergence of hri near
the time dependence of the ﬁtness landscape.
In particular, if
e
we take the ﬁtness to be φ(r, t) ∝ f (t)P (r) (f (t) = 1 in the ON-
state and f (t) = 0 in the OFF-state), with a stochastic f (t), then
the evolution dynamics becomes equivalent to the class of time-
dependent depinning problems studied by Lubensky and Nelson
(2000), with the critical behavior hri ∝ (

αc)−2.

consistent with the ﬁnding of a continuous second-order

what from the analytical result (14). This deviation is due to the
r-dependence of v and D, which we neglected in the analytical

Viral and bacterial evolution

We expect the selection threshold described above to
be detectable in evolution experiments with RNA viruses.
The total mutation rate ν for the binding site for RNA
viruses is of the order 10−3 ∼ 10−4 for a binding sequence
of length L = 10. Assuming that the ﬁtness gain of the
virus in the ON-state (i.e., the factor δφA in Eq. (2)) is
of the order of 1% ∼ 10%, then the eﬀective selection
α = 2f δφA/ν on the viral regulatory sequence
pressure
becomes of the order
αc ∼ O(1) if the fractional exposure
f to the ON-state is set at a few percent level. By vary-
ing f over the range of several percents, we expect that
the phase transition should be observable. Moreover, the
anomalous dependence (see footnote 4) of the selection

e

e

threshold on the temporal variation f (t) should also be
observable by applying controlled temporal changes to
the environment. The stationary distribution N0(r) it-
self can be monitored in principle by sequencing a rea-
sonable number (say 100) viral regulatory sequences after
stationarity is reached.

A very diﬀerent situation is expected for the evolution
of bacteria or even DNA viruses. The total mutation rate
ν is of the order 10−8 for bacteria and 10−6 for DNA
α is expected to be four orders
viruses. Consequently,
of magnitude larger than
αc for bacteria and two orders
larger for DNA viruses. What is the behavior of the
discrete model at such large values of
α ? In Fig. 4, we

obtained numerically as a function of
α on a logarithmic

α exceeding ∼ 140, we ﬁnd the peak is

e

This behavior is obviously an artifact of the speciﬁc
feature of the Fermi function landscape used in (8): for
very large
α’s, there is an incentive for the distribution
to move towards small r’s due to the very slight increase
in the value of P (r) for smaller r’s. But it is unrea-
sonable to expect that the simple relation between the
binding probability P (r) and the ﬁtness function φ(r)
assumed in this study to hold down to very small dif-
ferences in P (r). Aside from various kinetic eﬀects of
binding and temporal variations of the environment that
we have neglected, ﬂuctuations due to ﬁnite population
size (e.g., genetic drift) simply do not allow for the pop-
ulation to resolve the very small diﬀerences in ﬁtness due
to the small diﬀerences in P (r); see the theory of nearly-
neutral evolution (Ohta, 1992). Thus, φ(r) should be
eﬀectively r-independent for small r’s. This can be im-
plemented by replacing φ(r) by a constant value φ(r′
0)
when φ(r′
0) is below some resolution limit (set

0 − 1) − φ(r′

low mutation rate (or large

ing the ﬁtness function by an inﬁnte square well:

(18)

The stationary distribution obtained in this case depends
only on the width of the well r0, and is shown in Fig. 5 for
r0 = 3. Note that it is highly peaked at r0 as expected.
Hence the binding sequence is fuzzy even as
α → ∞.
However, it is diﬀerent from simply truncating the bino-
mial distribution (15) for r > r0 due to the mutational
load, i.e., a fraction of the population with r = r0 will
receive an additional deleterious mutation and not make
it to the next generation.

e

Comparison to known sites

It is useful to compare the above solution to biological
data. Unfortunately, polymorphisms in the same bind-
ing sequence across diﬀerent strains of a bacteria species
are not yet readily available.
Instead, we assume that
the diﬀerent binding sequences (of the same transcrip-
tion factor) located in diﬀerent regulatory regions across
the genome may be viewed as a sample of the station-
ary binding sequence distribution. This is clearly not
the case if the selection pressure is small, since close to
the selection threshold, even small diﬀerences in selection
pressure experienced by the diﬀerent binding sequences

9 This modiﬁcation of the ﬁtness function should in principle also
be applied to the case of RNA virus evolution in the vicinity
of the phase transition. However, it wouldn’t make much of a
diﬀerence there because the distribution would be already peaked
away from small r.

will produce diﬀerent binding sequence distributions; see
Fig. 2. But this should not be a concern for bacteria
since
αc there. An obvious candidate is the binding
sequences for the the well-known E. coli global regula-
tor CRP (also known as the catabolite activator protein,
CAP), which is activated under low cellular glucose level
(Saier et al., 1996). There are over one hundred CRP
sites in the E. coli genome. We take from the Regu-
lonDB database (Salgado et al., 2000) a list of 28 sites
which are biologically conﬁrmed binding sites and appear
only once in a given regulatory region. (The case of mul-
tiple binding sites is discussed in the following section.)
The drawback of using CRP sites is that CRP is hardly
ever the only regulator in a target regulatory region, and
interaction with other transcription factors can compli-
cate the situation.

Fig. 6 shows the histogram of the number of mis-
matches of these CRP sequences from the consensus se-
quence TGTGA......TCACA. While it peaks at r∗ = 2 ∼ 3
similar to the corresponding distribution of the inﬁnite-
mesa model in Fig. 5, it is clear that the distribution
of the CRP sites are broader. The few outliers at
r = 0, 1, 4, 5 may well be due to direct or subtle inter-
action with other factors which we have not considered
in this simple model. The existence of nearly equal peaks
at r = 2 and r = 3 is more perplexing: According to our
model, the distribution should be peaked at the largest
possible r. [For the L = 10 sequence, entropy favors r = 3
over r = 2 by a factor of eight.] One possible cause of
the discrepancy may be the deviation of the real binding
energy matrix εi(S) from the two state model. For in-
stance, suppose the chemical potential µ in the ON-state
is such that r0 = µ/ε is slightly below 3. Then accord-
ing to the pure two-state model, the maximum number
of allowed mismatches is 2. However, small deviations in
the binding energies from ε will allow a maximum of 3
mismatches in a subset of the L positions, thereby pro-
ducing a distribution peaked at both r = 2 and r = 3
as shown in Fig. 6. The actual stationary distribution of
r can be easily computed numerically if the energy ma-

9

trix is known. However at present, the authors know of
no example of a transcription factor whose binding en-
ergy matrix is measured and a large number of binding
sequences are available.

A very diﬀerent explanation of the data in Fig. 6 is
the diﬀerential selection of each of the CRP motifs as
alluded already in “Introduction”. Speciﬁcally, one can
envision a situation where the single “ON-state” assump-
tion we adopted is not valid, and instead the cell coor-
dinates a graded response to cellular glucose shortage,
requiring diﬀerent operons to turn ON at diﬀerent (ac-
tivated) CRP concentrations. Under this scenario, the
distribution in Fig. 6 is solely a result of the functional
need of the cell, and its resemblance to the statistical
distribution of Fig. 5 would be fortuituous. Distinguish-
ing between the diﬀerent plausibilities is important and
can be done by either sequencing the CRP binding sites
in a variety of related strains to accumulate statistics on
polymorphism for each site, or perform site-directed mu-
tagensis to speciﬁc binding motifs and directly measure
the ﬁtness function.

activation (or repression) is beneﬁcial for the biological
function. Consequently, selection would favor multiplets
over singlets. On the other hand, random mutations tend
to destroy the binding motifs, so that an additional motif
is maintained only when its contribution to the ﬁtness is
suﬃciently high.
In the following, we explore this sce-
nario within our model.

Let us assume there are two binding sites in a certain
regulatory region and ask whether they will be main-
tained by evolution. We begin by constructing a ‘two-
site ﬁtness function’ that makes the selection mechanism
outlined above explicit. As in the previous sections on
the single-site problem, we assume that the state of the
bacterium/virus alternates between an ON-state, where
factor binding leads to a ﬁtness gain, and an OFF-state,
where factor binding has a negative eﬀect. In the ON-
state, let the ﬁtness gain due to factor binding be δφA1,
δφA2, or δφA12, if a factor is bound to site 1 only, site
2 only, or both sites, respectively. Using the same argu-
ments as for the single site case, the time-averaged ﬁtness
becomes

Multiple binding sites

Φ = 1 + α · [P1(1 − P2) + σ P2(1 − P1) + ω P1P2] , (19)

It is well known that regulatory binding motifs often
occur in doublets or even higher multiplets. For instance,
the regulatory regions of the E. coli genes crp, dadA,
dsdXA, ﬁxA, glpFK, glpTQ, lac, manX, nagE, and tsx
are some of the many regions that contain two CRP bind-
ing sequences. Here, we extend our model to account
for the possibility of multiple sites that bind the same
protein and regulate the same promoter. We will pur-
sue the question of whether we can interpret regulatory
regions with multiplets as being under higher selective
pressure for factor binding than regulatory regions with
single binding sites.

Some factors (e.g., λ-repressor) bind cooperatively to
binding sites, thereby eﬀectively enhancing their DNA
binding speciﬁcity. Cooperative factor binding can play
an important and interesting role in transcription regu-
lation (see, e.g., Ptashne (1992)), however it does so only
for a fraction of the known multiplets, since many factors
(such as CRP) have no binding domain for an attractive
interaction between themselves. In the present study we
exclude factor-factor interactions and explore possible se-
lective advantages of multiple independent binding sites
in much the same spirit as gene duplication is studied
in the context of population genetics (see, e.g., Wagner
(2000)). One scenario could be that several bound tran-
scription factors can simultaneously interact with poly-
merase to synergistically recruit (or repel) it more ef-
ﬁciently than a single factor would. For the case of
CRP, this eﬀect has been observed, and studied in de-
tail, experimentally (Busby and Ebright, 1999; Langdon
and Hochschild, 1999). An individual organism with a
multiplet of binding sites for a factor then has a ﬁtness
advantage over one with a single binding site, if a strong

where P1, P2 denote the probabilities that a factor is
bound to site 1, 2, which depend on the respective se-
quences (we neglect the possibility of cooperative bind-
ing at this point). The selection pressure, α, has again
the form (2), with α = f δφA1, while the ‘synergism fac-
tor’ ω describes the fractional ﬁtness advantage of two
bound factors over just one, i.e. ω = δφA12/δφA1. In the
remaining term, the dimensionless coeﬃcient σ consti-
tutes an ‘asymmetry factor’ equal to the relative ﬁtness
gain δφA2/δφA1 (i.e. when σ 6= 1 one may distinguish
between a more “important” and a less important site).
Note that not only the selection pressure, but also ω and
σ may vary between diﬀerent regulatory regions, even
when they are controlled by the same factor, since both
depend on the location of the binding sites with respect
to the promoter and on the sequence of the promoter
itself (see the discussion at the end of this section).

As in the single site problem, we work in the two-state
model approximation (see section ‘Binding probability’),
so that the binding probabilities P1 and P2 only depend
on the number of mismatches r1 and r2 in the respective
site, and take the form (4). When the selection pressure
α is much larger than the mutation rate ν (as we typi-
cally expect in the case of bacterial evolution), we again
invoke the argument that very small diﬀerences in the ﬁt-
ness function are hardly resolvable by ﬁnite populations,
and therefore the ﬁtness function should become neutral,
i.e. r-independent, at small r1 and r2. This eﬀectively
amounts to using step functions for the binding proba-
bilities, i.e. P (r1,2) = 1 for r1,2 ≤ r0 and P (r1,2) = 0 for
r1,2 > r0. The two-site ﬁtness function in (r1, r2)-space

is then

1 + ασ if r2 ≤ r0 < r1
1 + αω if r1, r2 ≤ r0
if r1, r2 > r0

In order to simplify the discussion in the following, we
will use the ﬁtness function (20) over the whole range of
α, since it yields a correct description at large
α, and at
α, it produces no qualitative changes in the behav-
small
ior of the stationary distribution compared to the smooth
e
ﬁtness function with P (r) of the form (4).

It is straightforward to derive a two-site evolution
equation analogous to Eq. (7), which describes the
approach of the average distribution of mismatches
N (r1, r2, t) (neglecting ﬂuctuation eﬀects due to ﬁnite
population size) to its stationary state N0(r1, r2). One

izations of N (r1, r2, t) and φ(r1, r2), respectively. Fig. 7
illustrates the two-dimensional (biased) diﬀusion dynam-
ics that emerges from Eq. (22). The ﬁtness function
has a high plateau or ‘mesa’ at r1, r2 < r0, and two
strips of lower ﬁtness along the r1 and r2 axis. Hence
selection tries to keep r1, r2 < r0. Mutation, on the
other hand, drives the distribution towards the average
number of mismatches in a random binding sequence,
r1 = r2 = (A − 1)L/A, as indicated by the arrows in
Fig. 7. We are interested in the stationary distribu-
tion N0(r1, r2) that arises as a balance between selec-
tion and mutation. Below we characterize the depen-
dence of N0(r1, r2) on the eﬀective selection pressure

Let us neglect a possible asymmetry between the sites
α is
for the moment, i.e. we set σ = 1. It is clear that if
below a certain threshold value, no motif will be main-
tained, i.e. the peak of the stationary distribution will be
close to r1 = r2 = (A − 1)L/A. On the other extreme,
α is very large, the distribution will certainly be
when
localized on the high ﬁtness mesa, corresponding to two
conserved binding motifs. By analogy with the single site
case, we would expect the distribution to be maximally
fuzzy in this regime, and hence the peak of the stationary
distribution to be close to r1 = r2 = r0. What happens
when
α takes on intermediate values? Upon increasing
α, the peak of the stationary distribution may either pass
directly from r1 = r2 = (A − 1)L/A to r1 = r2 = r0 or
go through a state with only one conserved motif (see
e
Fig. 8). Intuitively, which of these “pathways” is taken,
should depend on the value of ω: when ω is small, the
selective advantage of two conserved motifs over one is
small and therefore a much higher selection pressure is
needed to stabilize two motifs against mutations than
just one, i.e. upon increasing the selection pressure the
system passes from 0 to 1 to 2 motifs. Conversely, when
ω is very large, two motifs are actually stabilized at lower
selection pressures than a single motif would be, and
hence the system passes directly from 0 to 2 motifs. We
can estimate the value ωc at which the system switches
between the two pathways: when (ω − 1) ≪ 1, the 1-
motif phase exists in an intermediate range of α’s, i.e.
αc1 <
αc2, where the lower critical value for the
transition from 0 to 1 motif is approximately the same
αc1 ∼ 1, and the up-

In the 1-motif phase, the selection of either motif, at

spondingly, N0(r1, r2) has two equal peaks as indicated

will disappear, but otherwise the qualitative behavior of
the model remains the same. For simplicity, we will keep
σ = 1 from here on.

above and to render it more quantitative, we now char-
acterize the behavior of N0(r1, r2) numerically using the
parameters tailored to CRP, i.e. L = 10 and r0 = 3.
To determine N0(r1, r2), we evolve an arbitrary initial
distribution N (r1, r2, t = 0) using Eq. (21) until the sta-
tionary state is reached. Fig. 9 displays three such sta-
tionary distributions, one each in the 0-motif, 1-motif,
and 2-motif phase (here, we used
α = 0.2, 5, and 50,
together with ω = 1.1). Besides justifying the schematic
sketch in Fig. 8, it shows that the distributions both in
the 1- and 2-motif phase are peaked at the “edge” r0 = 3
and are therefore maximally fuzzy as in the single site
problem.

e

Next, we focus on the transitions between the three
phases. In Fig. 10, the average total number of matches,
i.e. 2L−hr1i−hr2i (here h. . .i denotes an average over the
stationary distribution), is plotted against
α, again with
ω = 1.1 (solid line). We observe that the total number
α = 10.

These positions agree with our estimates
αc1 ∼ 1 and
αc2 ∼ (ω−1)−1 based on the qualitative discussion above.
(Note that since we work with a small ‘system size’ of L =
10, the transitions, which are sharp in the limit L → ∞,
e
appear only as smooth crossovers.) In order to show that
the rises are indeed caused by the transitions from the 0-
motif to the 1-motif phase, and from the 1-motif to the
2-motif phase, respectively, we also plotted the number of
matches in each site at the peak (at one of the two peaks
in the 1-motif phase) of the stationary distribution in
Fig. 10 (circles and triangles). This illustrates the typical
behavior of the individual sites: the ﬁrst site jumps from
2 ∼ 3 matches to 7 matches at
α ≈ 1 and the second
site does the same at
α ≈ 10. Hence, the motifs clearly
appear in a step-like fashion as the selection pressure is
increased.

In evolution experiments with RNA viruses,

this
twofold transition should be directly observable (if a
suitable operon can be identiﬁed where the ﬁtness func-
tion (19) is applicable), since according to our estimates
above,
α for these systems can be tuned over a range of
1 ∼ 100 by varying the fractional exposure to diﬀerent
environmental conditions. On the basis of our model,
one would expect, for instance, that one of the sites in a
doublet disappears in the course of an evolution experi-
ment, if the selection pressure is suﬃciently lowered by
reducing the exposure to the environment where binding
is beneﬁcial. When the exposure is reduced to zero, both
regulatory sites and the gene coding for the transcription
factor (if not required for other mechanisms) will be lost.

Let us now return to the scenario outlined at the be-
ginning of this section, and discuss whether we can inter-
e
pret the regulatory regions with multiplets as being under
higher selective pressure for factor binding than the ones
with single binding sites. Our study of the two-site prob-
lem would justify this conclusion, if (a) the values of ω
and σ were very similar for all regulatory regions, and (b)
the eﬀective selection pressure were typically on the same
αc2. Then, we could tentatively as-
order of magnitude as
sociate singlets with an
αc2, and multiplets with
α above that threshold. However, both conditions are
an
not likely to be fulﬁlled generically in bacteria. First, the
values of ω and σ not only depend on the sequence of the
promoter and the distance of the binding sites from the
promoter, but also on the level of gene expression that
is beneﬁcial for the cell. For example, genes that code
for proteins which are not needed in large amounts, even
in the environmental condition where their expression is
favored, do not require a large activation, and hence the

eﬀect of a second binding site could even be detrimental,
α should typically be on the order of
i.e. ω < 1. Second,
104 (see above), and hence, as long as ω is only slightly
larger than one (ω > 1.0001), our model would always
predict multiple binding sites for bacterial transcription
factors. Therefore, within our model, whether one or two
motifs are maintained depends almost exclusively on the
value of ω, i.e. ω ≤ 1 leads to one motif and ω > 1 to
two motifs. However, there may be cases where maintain-
ing subtle diﬀerences in the temporal ordering of turning
on/oﬀ diﬀerent operons would give rise to a very small
ﬁtness advantage, e.g. ﬂagella assembly and SOS-respnse
in E. coli (see recent results by U. Alon, submitted for
publication). In such cases, the system may respond by
keeping one or two motifs according to the theory we
presented. And of course there is also the situation of
RNA viruses described above where the twofold transi-
tion as depicted in Fig. 10 could in principle be directly
observed.

Discussion and Conclusions

The fuzziness of regulatory binding motifs is a widely
observed phenomenon. The present investigation has
shown that the entropic advantage of introducing mis-
matches from the best binding sequence is suﬃcient to
produce motifs that are maximally fuzzy while still re-
taining the capability of factor binding. Nevertheless, we
cannot exclude that the fuzziness actually bears a selec-
tive advantage (in the language of population genetics,
this would correspond to a stabilizing selective pressure).
The alternative scenario given for the fuzziness of the
CRP sites is an explicit example of the latter. It would
be very interesting to address this question experimen-
tally by directly measuring the ﬁtness of a bacterium or

virus as a function of the sequence of its binding sites:
starting with a wild-type binding site that has several
mismatches, what is the eﬀect on the ﬁtness, when the
number of mismatches is reduced by site-directed mu-
tagenesis? Does the ﬁtness remain unchanged or is it
reduced? Besides answering the question raised above,
experiments of that type could also lead to important
conclusions on the evolution of genetic regulation.

Another important result of our study is the phase
transition associated with the maintenance of motifs.
Our general conclusion is that the selection pressure on
a single binding motif needs to surpass a threshold value
of approximately ν0L/2 to guarantee maintenance, while
the threshold for a second site (for the same factor and in
the same regulatory region) is larger by a factor (ω−1)−1,
where ω is given by the ratio of the ﬁtness of the organ-
ism with two sites over the ﬁtness of the organism with
one site. As pointed out above, this prediction could be
tested experimentally by evolving RNA viruses in a ﬂuc-
tuating environment and varying the fractional exposure
to the environment where factor binding is beneﬁcial. In
this case there would be no need to do site-directed mu-
tagenesis, since the transition could be observed directly
by sequencing.

Our model makes quantitative predictions on the
statistics of polymorphisms in binding sites. To test
these, it will not suﬃce to sequence a particular bind-
ing site in many diﬀerent isolates from a single, large
(N ν0 ≫ 1) laboratory population, since this population
originates from a small, genetically homogeneous popu-
lation and it takes a time on the order of ν−1
to equi-
librate the distribution of mismatches in a binding site.
Instead, sequencing the same binding sites in several dif-
ferent strains should yield the desired data. Besides al-
lowing a comparison to our model, detailed information
on polymorphisms in binding sequences would also make
it possible to address a number of interesting questions,
e.g. how does the selection pressure on binding sites com-
pare with the selection pressure on coding sequences10?
Or, can one identify compensating mutations between
promoter and binding site sequences, e.g. could a mu-
tation that weakens the promoter be compensated by a
mutation that increases the aﬃnity of an activator to its
operator site?

We conclude that the evolution of transcription factor
binding sites is a problem that is well suited to establish-
ing a link between the detailed molecular biophysics of a
system and its evolutionary dynamics. The theory pre-

10 For example, we would expect that the selection pressure on the
coding sequence of the binding region in transcription factors
such as crp or lexA, which have many binding sites distributed
over the whole genome, is much higher than on individual op-
erator sites, since a change in the sequence of an operator site
aﬀects only the regulation of that particular site, while a change
in the aminoacid sequence of the binding region of the protein
aﬀects the regulation of many genes.

sented in the present article is meant as a ﬁrst step, with
the hope of stimulating future experiments in this direc-
tion. There are many directions for the improvement
of the model and the analysis. One important ques-
tion is the validity of the mean-ﬁeld analysis described
here. Is the ﬁnite population size eﬀect important here
and how would it change the motif statistics within our
model? One can also investigate more elaborate models
including, for instance, the eﬀect of time-dependent en-
vironment, the coupled evolution of the polymerase and
transcription factor the binding sites, and the interaction
among diﬀerent factors.

equations are analyzed in both works, the emphasis are
quite diﬀerent, with Sengupta and Shraiman arguing for
a “robustness” criterion based on minimizing mutational
load.

As far as these phenomena are studied sometimes by

quite di(cid:27)erent disiplines of siene, it is interesting to

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We suggest in this work the use of the IPVC to ob-

tain a variational formulation for self-limiting systems.

(32)

This approah provides at least a Lagrangean, if it ex-

and t → ∞,

ists, departing from the equation of motion and regard-

less the system being onservative (when the de(cid:28)nition

L = T −V holds) or not. There are several advantages,

namely, it is possible

(a) to have in just one relation all the dynamial

information of the system;

(b) to use a well know mathematial mahinery to

obtain from the Lagrangean or Hamiltonian the on-

Thus the total mean energy of the systems desribed

by VLE is always null. But if as superior temporal

On the other hand, making use of the Ho jman

et al. method, we have found the Lagrangean (25)

and Hamiltonian (26) orresponding to the (1+1)-

dimensional logisti equation as an example of the

way a variational formalism an be obtained for gen-

eral self-regulated systems. This may be regarded as a

proof that the VLE orresponds to an extremal tra je-

First, let write the logisti equation as

tory, thus it is physially aeptable (it omplies with

.
q = kq (B − q)

the Hamilton's Least-Ation Priniple) despite the fat

(41)

Verhulst introdued it heuristially.

The potential energy (28) was brie(cid:29)y analized and

the equilibria points and the stable/unstable ases

were obtained by means of the usual derivative riteria,

in aord with the other method (see [12℄). Also, using

the virial theorem it was possible to write an expres-

where q ≡ q(t) is the generalized oordinate. Then, let
write and hoose a new integral variable Q(t)

sion for the total mean energy of the system, equation

(32), and a relation between the mean-squared veloity

suh that equation (41) transforms in

and the mean-linear veloity, equation (37).

It is not surprising to note that the Malthusian limit

is trivially obtained for the partiular ase when B
tends to ∞. Thus, the potential energy for this ase

We have in this work studied the thus-alled se-

(44)

ond order approah. There is, ertainly, a (cid:28)rst order

method of the Ho jman et al. proeedure [7, 10℄; we

show brie(cid:29)y in the Appendix the way an s-equivalent

where x1 ≡ x1(t) and x2 ≡ x2(t). Note that indeed x2
is exatly the generalized oordinate q .

The solution of this system of equations is given by

.
x1 = x2
.
x2 = kx2(B − x2)

(cid:26)

approah. Even though the Lagrangean reprodues

the logisti equation, as required, the physial inter-

pretation of its terms is not so lear. However, gen-

erally speaking, it is important to bear in mind this

proeedure beause it sometimes provides a variational

formalism of the physial phenomenon while the se-

ond order approah does not [7℄.

Finally, it ould be useful to study in future works

generalized auto-regulated models as for example

and this funtional form for x2 is just another way to

those reported in referenes [23, 24, 25, 26, 27℄.

It

write the usual form (2). Now, solving (45) and (46)

is also interesting to extend this work to the study of

for C1 and C2 we obtain

the quantum systems related with self-regulated phe-

nomena [28℄.

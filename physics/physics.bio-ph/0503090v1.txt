Abstract

DNA melting and hybridization is a fundamental biological process as well as a
crucial step in many modern biotechnology applications. DNA conﬁned on surfaces
exhibits diﬀerent behavior from that in free solutions. The system of DNA-capped
gold nanoparticles exhibits unique phase transitions and represents a new class of
complex ﬂuids. Depending on the sequence of the DNA, particles can be linked to
each other through direct complementary DNA sequences or via a “linker” DNA
whose sequence is complementary to the sequence attached to the gold nanoparti-
cles. We observed diﬀerent melting transitions for these two distinct systems.

1 Introduction

Melting of the DNA duplex is the process by which two DNA strands unbind
upon heating. The nature of this transition has been studied for decades [1,2,3].
For short DNA with fewer than 12–14 base pairs, melting and hybridization
can be described by a two-state model as an equilibrium between single- and
double-stranded DNA [4,5]. For long and heterogeneous DNA, the melting
curve exhibits a multi-step behavior consisting of plateaus with diﬀerent sizes
separated by sharp jumps. Although much of the thermodynamic properties of
the melting of free DNA are known, DNA melting in a constrained space, such
as on surfaces, is still poorly understood [6]. DNA molecules functionalized
with gold nanoparticles provide a model system for such study.

The sequence-speciﬁc hybridization properties of DNA have been used for
self-assembly of nanostructures and for highly sensitive DNA detection [7,8].

Previous work relies on a linker DNA [7,8,9,10], and it has been suggested that
entropic cooperativity plays an important role in the sharp phase transition
of such DNA-linked nanoparticle assembly systems. On the other hand, most
simulations do not explicitly incorporate linker DNA [11], and the results
cannot be directly compared to experimental data. Here we synthesized a
system that eliminated the usage of a linker DNA and found that the melting
transitions of these direct-linked gold particles exhibit distinct behavior from
those connected via a linker DNA.

2 Experimental Procedures

Sample was prepared according to the procedures described in [8]. Brieﬂy,
DNA-capped gold nanoparticles were prepared by conjugating gold colloidal
nanoparticles with thiol-modiﬁed DNA. The conﬁguration of the DNA used in
diﬀerent experiments is illustrated in Fig. 1. We prepared four sets of samples
with diﬀerent DNA lengths and sequences. In sample I, the gold particles
are connected through a 24-base DNA linker; in sample II, the gold particles
are directly connected via 12-base complementary DNA on gold particles; in
sample III, the gold particles are directly connected via 12- and 18-base DNA;
in sample IV, the gold particles are directly connected via 18-base DNA.

connected through a linker DNA. The line between bases A and G in the probe
DNA sequences indicates that there is no chemical bond between these two bases.
Sample II-IV are directly connected through surface-attached DNA with spacings
of 12, 18, and 24 DNA bases between particles.

I), and (b) via direct hybridization of complementary surface-attached DNA (sample
II). The corresponding free DNA melting curves are also shown.

The aggregates of DNA-linked gold colloids were allowed to stand at 4 ◦C
for several days for aggregation. Optical spectroscopy was used to study the
phase transition of the DNA-linked gold colloids, since DNA bases have strong
absorption in the UV region [4,5]. We monitor the thermal melting by mea-
suring the extinction at 260 nm while slowly heating the solution containing
aggregates. The solution was heated from 25 to 75 ◦C at a rate of 0.5 ◦C/min.
All spectra were taken with a PerkinElmer Lambda 45 spectrophotometer
equipped with a peltier temperature controller, magnetic stirrer, and a tem-
perature probe. The recorded temperature of the sample was measured by a
temperature probe.

3 Results and Discussion

Fig. 2 shows the the melting curves of sample I (a) and sample II (b). The
melting curves of corresponding DNA in solution are also shown. The melting
temperature of DNA duplex attached to gold particle surfaces is lower than
that of free DNA, and the melting transition is much sharper. However, direct
comparison of melting temperatures between these two systems is diﬃcult,
since the DNA compositions are diﬀerent for these two systems. The system
without linker appears to have a lower melting temperature, perhaps due to
the short distance between gold particles (12 base versus 24 base).

To study how the melting depends on the spacing between gold particles,
we prepared gold particles capped with 18 base DNA (Sample III), which is
composed of identical sequence to the 12 base DNA in Sample II plus a 6
base DNA spacer (see Fig. 1). The diﬀerence between sample II and III is
the spacer DNA length, which alter the spacing between gold particles. The
melting temperature is 62 ◦C for sample IV versus 32 ◦C for sample II (see

and a combination of 12/12, 12/18, and 18/18 (Sample II + III + IV). The mixed
system shows multi-step melting at temperatures corresponding to the Tm’s, within
the experimental uncertainty, for Sample II and Sample III.

Fig 3), which suggests that increased particle spacing leads to higher melting
temperature of the assemblies.

To introduce disorder, we mixed the 12 and 18 base DNA capped gold particles
in one solution. Thus, the 12 base DNA are allowed to hybridize with either
12 or 18 base DNA, and the 18 base to 18 or 12 base DNA. This combination
allows three possible duplex formations: 12/12 (sample I), 12/18 (sample II),
and 18/18 (sample III) hybridization in one solution and possibly in one ag-
gregate. Note that in all three base pairing only 12 bases are complementary,
and the only variable is the non-pairing DNA spacer length, which controls the
inter-particle distance. Since the duplexes with higher melting temperatures
are more stable, we expect to see more of those duplexes forming. Indeed,
Fig. 3 shows that the most abundant duplex is the 18/18 combination, fol-
lowed by 12/18, with almost no 12/12 duplex formed.

The multi-step melting is an unusual phenomenon in DNA-capped gold par-
ticle assembly. For the system connected by either 24 or 30 base DNA linker,
where the 30 base linker diﬀers from the 24 base by an extra 6 base spacer
in the middle of the linker, heating the assembly results in a single melting
temperature Tm. The Tm of the system with spacer is higher (37 ◦C) than
that without spacer (33 ◦C). When equal amounts of linkers with and without
spacer are present in the solution, the system has a Tm in between the high Tm
(37 ◦C) and low Tm (33 ◦C) systems. The Tm of the mixed system (36.5 ◦C) is
much closer to the more stable system (37 ◦C), as illustrated in Fig. 4a. How-
ever, free DNA with the same sequences exhibits diﬀerent trend in Tm (see
Fig. 4b), where a linker with spacer results in lower melting temperature than
that without spacer. The ﬁnding suggests that the inter-particle distance plays
an important role in determining the Tm in the nanoparticle system. On the
other hand, the multi-step melting in the system without linker DNA suggests
most clusters are composed of either 12/18 connections or 18/18 connectionis

and few with both connected in the same cluster, unlike the systems with
linker DNA. The abundance of clusters of a given connection is related to
its stability. We speculate that once the cluster nucleate with a certain type
of connection (deﬁned here by the DNA length, hence the interparticle spac-
ing) only the same type of connection is allowed to grow. Further studies are
needed to determine whether this phenomenon is kinetics or thermodynamics
driven.

In summary, we have studied the thermal denaturation of DNA strands at-
tached to gold nanoparticle surfaces. In the DNA-capped gold nanoparticle
systems, the interactions are complex, involving DNA-DNA interactions and
particle-particle interactions. The DNA are constrained to a gold particle sur-
face and often exhibit interesting behaviors not seen by DNA in free solution.
The multi-step melting of systems with diﬀerent spacers is unique to the sys-
tems directly linked with DNA that are attached to gold nanoparticles.

Abstract

In a recent paper, Newman [1] surveys the literature on power law spectra in
evolution, self-organised criticality and presents a model of his own to arrive
at a conclusion that self-organised criticality is not necessary for evolution.
Not only did he miss a key model (Ecolab [2,3]) that has a clear self-organised
critical mechanism, but also Newman’s model exhibits the same mechanism
that gives rise to power law behaviour as does Ecolab. I would argue that
this mechanism should be described as self-organised critical.

In this paper, I have also implemented Newman’s model using the Eco-
lab software, removing the restriction that the number of species remains
constant.
It turns out that the requirement of constant species number is
non-trivial, leading to a global coupling between species that is similar in
eﬀect to the species interactions seen in Ecolab. In fact, the model must self-
organise to a state where the long time average of speciations balances that
of the extinctions, otherwise the system either collapses or explodes.

In view of this, the real contribution of Newman’s model is to provide a
simple, almost analytic model that can used to understand more sophisticated
models such as Ecolab.
In this paper, I derive analytically the power law
distribution of species lifetimes, and show that the exponent is expected to
be precisely -2 for Newman’s model.
In the Ecolab model the exponent is
expected to be -2 for small times, but increasing to -1 at larger times. The
generality of this argument points to a universality class of these types of
systems, which quite possibly includes biological evolution [4].

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the last ﬁve years, the notion that Biological Evolution is a self-organised critical
phenomenon has gained currency, and in particular, has been championed by Bak [5] and
Kauﬀman [6]. Self-organised critical phenomena are characterised by a frustration between
two processes. The archetypical example is that of a sandpile, where the process of adding
sand to a sand pile makes the slope of that pile steeper is opposed by the instability of
the sandpile which works to make the sandpile ﬂatter once the slope passes a critical angle.
One of the the most obvious manifestations of criticality is a power law spectral behaviour,
although criticality is by no means necessary for this power law behaviour to be manifest.
In a recent paper, Newman [1] surveys the ﬁeld to conclude that the mechanism by which
ecosystems are driven to criticality is not well understood, but that the evidence in the fossil
record for power law spectra of extinction event size and species lifetimes is good. Sol´e
et. al. [7] present the best evidence yet that these distributions are power laws. However,
Newman missed an important model of evolution, Ecolab [2,3], that is more general than
those surveyed, and gives us the best idea yet of how evolution could be a self-organised
critical phenomenon.

Newman goes further to introduce his own model of evolution to make the point that
the coevolutionary avalanches that all the other models (including Ecolab) exhibit are not
necessary for the observed power law behaviour. He further claims that his model is not
critically self-organised. However, the mechanism that leads to power law behaviour in
Newman’s model is precisely the same as that in Ecolab, and that mechanism is of the
nature of a frustration between two processes that characterises Bak’s sandpile model.

II. ECOLAB

In this section, we consider a model of evolution called Ecolab. Ecolab (perhaps unfor-
tunately) is both the name of a model and a simulation system written by the author to
implement that model. The ecology is described by a generalised Lotka-Volterra equation,
which is perhaps the simplest ecological model to use.

nsp

˙ni = rini +

βijninj

(1)

j=1
X
Here r is the diﬀerence between the birth rate and death rate for each species, in the absence
of competition or symbiosis. β is the interaction term between species, with the diagonal
terms referring to the species’ self limitation, which is related in a simple way to the carrying
capacity Ki for that species in the environment by Ki = −riβii. In the literature (eg Strobeck
[8], Case [9]) the interaction terms are expressed in a normalised form, αij = −Ki/riβij, and
αii = 1 by deﬁnition. n is the species density.

These equations are simulated on a simulator called Ecolab. [10] The vectors n and r are
stored as dynamic arrays, the size of which (i.e. the system dimension) can change in time.

A. Linear Stability Analysis

Linear analysis starts with the ﬁxed point of equation (1)

ˆn = −β−1r,

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

where ˙n = 0. There is precisely one ﬁxed point in the interior of the space of population
densities (i.e. n such that ni > 0) provided that all components of ˆn are positive, giving
rise to the following inequalities:

ˆni =

β−1r

i > 0, ∀i

This interior space is denoted Rnsp

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

+ mathematically.

There may also be ﬁxed points on the boundary of Rnsp

+ , where one or more components
of n are zero (corresponding to an extinct species). This is because the subecology with the
living species only (i.e. with the extinct species removed) is equivalent to the full system.

The stability of this point is related to the negative deﬁniteness of derivative of ˙n at ˆn.

The components of the derivative are given by

∂ ˙ni
∂nj

ˆn

β−1r

(cid:0)
Stability of the ﬁxed point requires that this matrix should be negative deﬁnite. Since
i are all negative by virtue of (3), this is equivalent to β being negative deﬁnite,
the
or equivalently, that its nsp eigenvalues all have negative real part. Taken together with the
inequalities (3), this implies that 2nsp inequalities must be satisﬁed for the ﬁxed point to be
stable. This point was made by Strobeck [8], in a slightly diﬀerent form. (Note that Strobeck
i riˆni/Ki > 0, so comes to the conclusion that 2nsp − 1 conditions
implicitly assumes that
are required.) If one were to randomly pick coeﬃcients for a Lotka-Volterra system, then
it has a probability of 4−nsp of being stable, i.e. one expects ecosystems to become more
unstable as the number of species increases [11].

P

Whilst stability is a nice mathematical property, it has rather less relevance when it comes
to real ecologies. For example the traditional predator-prey system studied by Lotka and
Volterra has a limit cycle. The ﬁxed point is decidedly unstable, yet the ecology is permanent
in the sense that both species’ densities are larger than some threshhold value for all time.
Hofbauer et al. [12] and Law and Blackford [13] discuss the concept of permanence in Lotka-
Volterra systems, which is the property that there is a compact absorbing set M ⊂ Rnsp
+ i.e

B. Permanence

once a trajectory of the system has entered M, it remains in M. They derive a suﬃcient
condition for permanence due to Jansen [14] of the form:

pifi( ˆnB) =

pi(ri −

βij ˆnBj) > 0, ∃pi > 0

(6)

i
X

i

j
X
for every ˆnB equilibrium points lying on the boundary (ˆnBi = 0 ∃i), provided the system is
bounded (or equivalently dissipative).1 This condition is more general than stability of the
equilibrium — the latter condition implies that a local neighbourhood of the equilibrium is
an absorbing set. Also, the averaging property of Lotka-Volterra systems implies that the
equilibrium must lie in the positive cone Rnsp

+ . So (3) must still hold for permanence.

Consider the boundary points ˆnB that are missing a single species i. Then Jansen’s

condition for these boundary points is

ri −

βij ˆnBj > 0.

j
X

(7)

This set of conditions is linearly independent. Let the number of such boundary points be
denoted by nB ≤ nsp. Then the set of conditions (6) will have rank nB ≤ ν ≤ nsp (the
number of linearly independent conditions, so the system has at most probability 2−nsp−ν of
satisfying Jansen’s permanence condition if the coeﬃcients are chosen uniformly at random.
As stability is also suﬃcient for permanence, the probability lies between 4−nsp and 2−nsp−ν.
Another rather important property is resistance to invasion. [9] Consider a boundary
equilibrium ˆnB. If it is proof against invasion from the missing species, then the full system
cannot be permanent. For the boundary points that miss a single species, this implies that
condition (7) is necessarily satisﬁed for permanence, along with (3). The probability of
permanence is then bounded above by 2−nsp−nB.

The important point to take away from this section is that whilst a randomly selected
ecology is more likely to be permanent than to have a stable equilibrium, the likelihood
decreases exponentially with increase in species number.

C. Mutation

Adding mutation involves adding an additional operator to equation (1)

˙n = r ∗ n + n ∗ βn + mutate(µ, r, n)

(8)

where ∗ refers to elementwise multiplication. This operator extends the dimension of the
whole system, so is rather unusual. It is not germane to the present argument what the
precise form of mutate is, the interested reader is referred to the previous publications
describing it [2,3,10]. Suﬃce it to say, that it adds new species according to a stochastic
mechanism, and that we would expect that the criticality result to be robust with respect
to changes of mutation algorithm employed.

1Boundedness is ensured in this model by choosing the βij such that βij + βji ≤ 0, ∀i, j. This
precludes symbiosis, but does allow for unstable behaviour. See [10] for a discussion of boundedness

4

D. Self Organised Criticality

Lets consider what happens to the largest eigenvalue of β. Suppose initially, the system
has a stable equilibrium, in which case all the eigenvalues have negative real part. As
mutations are added to the system, the largest eigenvalue will increase towards zero. As
it passes zero, the system destabilises, and the system will start to exhibit limit cycles or
chaotic behaviour. As further mutations are added to the system, permanence is no longer
satisﬁed, and an extinction event will occur. This will restore permanency to the system,
and possibly even stability. So we have two frustrated processes opposed to each other, the
ﬁrst, mutation, which builds up ecosystem complexity, and the second being the trend to
impermanency as ecosystem become more complex. This is analogous to the sand being
added to the top of the pile, and the stability of the sandpile slope in Bak’s sandpile model.

III. THE NEWMAN MODEL

Newman has presented his model of evolution in a number of papers [15,16,1], and is
largely equivalent to an earthquake model presented in [17,18]. In the biological context,
the model has a ﬁxed number of species, all of which feel an environmental stress, denoted
by η(t), which is random variate with distribution pstress(η). Each species has an individual
threshold xi, such that if η > xi, species i becomes extinct. These extinct species are
then replaced by new species, with thresholds randomly assigned from some distribution
pthresh(x). There is one further twist to the model, in that the threshold values are allowed
to drift over time in order to prevent the model stagnating with every species having the
maximum threshold.

The Ecolab software allows us to build a variant of this model that allows the number
of species to vary over time. When the model was ﬁrst implemented, the system underwent
a “mutation catastrophe”, in which the number of species exploded, This is similar to what
happens in the Ecolab model when the mutation rate is set too high. Normally, one would
expect that the number of speciation events should be proportional to the number of species.
However, this leads to an excess of speciation over extinctions.

The resolution of this conundrum is to require that the stress values η be proportional
to the number of species, i.e. η = nspη′, where η′ is drawn from some distribution pstress(η′).
The justiﬁcation for making this assumption can be seen by considering a simpliﬁed model
of Ecolab (called Ecolab--), described in the next section. Of course, in Newman’s original
model, nsp is a constant, and so his model is consistent with this modiﬁcation.

Once the stress values depend on species number, the system self-organises so that spe-
ciations and extinctions balance on average. A trace of nsp can be seen in Figure 1, and the
distribution of lifetimes is seen in Figure 2. The peak in the curve at τ = 10 is an artifact
of the simulation, and should be ignored. The distribution actually has two regions, the
inner one 10 ≪ τ ≪ 103 having a power law with exponent ≈ −1, and the outer region
τ ≫ 103 having exponent ≈ −2. Note that in this histogram, an exponentially increasing
bin size was chosen, so that the bins are uniformly distributed on a log scale. If uniform
sized bins are chosen, the small lifetime behaviour gets masked — one sees a straight line
on the log-log plot, with slope that varies with bin size, but approached −2 as the number
of bins is increased.

IV. THE ECOLAB-- MODEL

In this section, we will consider a simpliﬁcation of the Ecolab model where the interaction
j βijnj are replaced by a random variate ηi(t) from a suitable distribution:

terms

P

˙ni = (ri − ηi)ni

(9)

Since ηi is eﬀectively a sum of a large number of independent quantities, its distribution will
tend to be normal, and the deviation (controlling how large ηi gets) will be proportional to
nsp, the connectance (proportion of nonzero elements in β) and the interaction strength. This
is why stresses in the Newman model must be proportional to nsp. When ηi exceeds ri for
any signiﬁcant period of time, species i becomes extinct. Since ηi(t) is a continuous function
of n(t) which is itself a continuous function of t, there will be a correlation η(t)η(t + τ ) >
0, ∀τ < τ0, ∃τ0 > 0. Equation (9) connects the full Ecolab model with the Newman model.
In order to make the analysis simpler, we assume that ni are real valued, rather than

threshold σ, such that if ni < σ, species i is extinct.

V. DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES LIFETIMES

Figure 2 shows the distribution of species lifetimes (time from speciation to extinction)
in the augmented Newman model. This ﬁgure is not normalised, as a power law xα has
an inﬁnite integral. So the abcissa of the graph is not signiﬁcant, but the slope is. The
lines are ﬁtted by linear regression. Authors often quote a correlation coeﬃcient, however
this is generally meaningless on a log-log plot. Even the value of the slope is meant to be
an indication only, as the large relative error at high lifetime values can lead to signiﬁcant
errors in the computed slope.

Figure 3 shows the lifetime distribution for Ecolab which has a slope of −2 for lifetimes
less than 100, but −1 for larger lifetimes. Previously published versions of this graph [3] only
show the smaller lifetime behaviour. In spite of the similarity of the mechanism between the
Newman model and the Ecolab model, the lifetime distribution is remarkably diﬀerent.

Consider now the probability p(τ |x) that a species with threshold x will become extinct
at time t = τ . Since time is discrete in this model, this is simply the probability that the
stress η does not exceed x for the ﬁrst τ steps, times the probability that η exceeds x on the
next time step:

p(τ |x) =

pstress(η)dη

pstress(η)dη.

log p(τ ) = − log τ − log(τ + 1)

≈ −2 log τ, τ ≫ 1.

So the −2 slope is derived for this case.

We can relax the assumption pthresh(x) = pstress(x) by bracketing:

K0pstress(x) ≤ pthresh(x) ≤ K1pstress(x)

for some constants K0 and K1. This is always possible when the probability distributions
are bounded (no delta functions please!). Then we have

or taking logs

K0 ≤ p(τ )τ (τ − 1) ≤ K1

log K0 ≤ log p(τ ) + 2 log τ ≤ K1, τ ≫ 1.

(15)

Integrating equation (14), we have K0 ≤ 1 ≤ K1, so inequality (15) implies that log p(τ ) is
bracketed by two lines of slope −2 on the log-log plot. Provided that log K1 − log K0 is not
too large and τ is taken over many orders of magnitude, this can be quite a tight bracket.
Now lets us turn our attention to the Ecolab-- model to see if similar relationship can
be derived. In what follows, the species index i is dropped. Integrating equation (9) gives
us:

and taking logarithms gives:

since n0 = 1 for all new species.

This result indicates that there are two domains: the ﬁrst being when τ < K0

the lifetimes distribution is a power law with exponent −2; and the other domain being
when τ > K1
K1−K0 , where the exponent is −1. In between, there will be a transition between
the two domains. This is what is seen in Figure 3.

VI. CONCLUSION

The Newman model owes its criticality to much the same mechanism as does Ecolab,
although the assumption of constant species number hides essential interspecies connections.
Both models demonstrate a power law exponent near −2, in agreement with other models
and fossil data. A theoretical justiﬁcation explaining this value of the power law exponent
of the species lifetime curve is given for both the Newman and a simpliﬁed Ecolab model.
The generality of the argument indicates a universality class of these types of models.

The theoretical argument also predicts a turnover or transition in the power law be-
haviour between a region with exponent −2 and another region for exponent −1 in the
Ecolab model, which is observed in the computational model.

We propose and solve a Hamiltonian model for multidimensional epistastatic interactions between
beneﬁcial mutations. The model is able to give rise either to a phase transition between two
equilibrium states, without any coexistence, or exhibits a state where hybrid species can coexist,
with gradual passage from one wild type to another. The transition takes place as a function of the
tolerance of the environment, which we deﬁne as the amount of noise in the system.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Evolution takes place via natural selection, whereby
random mutations which have a salutary eﬀect on the
ﬁtness (survival probability and/or reproductive capabil-
ity) of the individual persist in the population and lead
to new variants; other, neutral mutations may simply be
carried along since they do not aﬀect the well being of
the individual. Deleterious mutations usually aﬀect the
organism adversely, and the accumulation of too many
will reduce the ﬁtness drastically. Each “species” actu-
ally consists of a more or less narrow distribution in the
phase space of all possible genetic states, and this distri-
bution may shift, in response to environmental pressure,
along deﬁnite evolutionary routes. [1]

An interesting problem is to explain the rather fast
rates at which populations seem to be able to adapt to
changing environments, which suggest that the ﬁtness
does not depend in a simple additive way on the eﬀects
of each independent mutation, but that there is a non-
linear relationship, or epistasis [2], between the eﬀects
of point mutations determining the ﬁtness function. In
fact, one may surmise that evolution is not a Markovian
game, but that the ﬁtness depends upon the history of
the successive mutations, in other words, it is a function
of the path taken in genomic space. [3] Thus, for a muta-
tion leading to the development of ﬁngers to be beneﬁcial,
say, one must already have had a mutation leading to the
formation of limbs.

Posed in this way, this problem seems to demand an
analysis that is intrinsically dynamical. Yet, it actually
lends itself to a treatment in terms of statistical equilib-
ria, with the appropriate choice of a ﬁtness function. In
this paper we aim to provide such a ﬁtness function, and
solve the resulting model for possibly coexisting equilib-
rium phases indicating diﬀerent species.

II. THE MODEL

where the genotype of an individual is represented by a
string of Boolean variables σi, i = 1, . . . N . If one takes
the wild type, or the initial genotype, to consist of a
string of 0’s, each point mutation is indicated by ﬂip-
ping the bit respresenting a given gene, from 0 to 1. The
number of mutations m is then the number of 1’s on the
i σi. The ﬁtness is usually taken
whole string, i.e., m =
simply to be a function, albeit nonlinear, of m.
P

Clearly, each i’th variable can be considered as an in-
dependent direction in phase space, so that evolution
takes place in an N dimensional space, where N is the
length of the genome. The genotype is a vertex on an N -
dimensional unit hypercube, and if only single ﬂips from
0 to 1 are allowed at a time, the path of evolution is a
directed random walk (always in the direction of increas-
ing σi) on the edges of this hypercube. One possible way
in which a vector variable can be introduced is to con-
sider the whole vector V ≡ {σi} as the argument of the
ﬁtness function. Since the position of each gene on this
particular string can be assigned with some arbitrariness,
one may then demand that the ﬁtness is only increased
relative to the wild type if the bits that ﬂip to 1 occur
sequentially. [3]. Thus, (0, 0, . . .), (1, 0, . . .)(1, 1, 0 . . .) are
in increasing order of ﬁtness while (0, 1, . . .) is less ﬁt.

This demands that we introduce a cost function H
which depends on the state V, and we have chosen the
ﬁtness f to decrease exponentially with this cost func-
tion, viz.,

f ∝ e−βH

(1)

where β is a measure of how eﬀective the cost function
is, in aﬀecting the ﬁtness. The ﬁtness function f can
be identiﬁed as the Boltzmann factor in an equilibrium
statistical model with the hamiltonian H, at constant
inverse “temperature” β−1. Temperature may be seen
as the amount of randomness, or disorder in the system,
competing with the cost function in determining the ﬁt-
ness. The higher the temperature, or randomness, the
weaker will be the eﬀect of the cost function in determin-
ing the state of the system. Therefore we deﬁne

Since Eigen ﬁrst introduced the quasi-species model [4]
there has been a huge amount of both analytical and nu-
merical work on bitstring models of genetic evolution [5],

as the tolerance in the system.

T ≡ β−1

(2)

For the cost function we will borrow a hamiltonian
introduced by Bakk at al. [6], in the context of protein
folding, where it is of importance that the folding events
take place in a prescribed order. Thus,

H = −λJ

σi − (1 − λ)J

σi

.

It can be seen that for λ = 0, the only state which is
favorable is that with all σi = 1, whereas for 0 < λ ≤ 1,
all states with an uninterrupted initial sequence of 1s of
arbitrary length m lead to improved ﬁtness. Here J is
a measure of the strength of the interaction between the
states of each of the sites (alleles), σi. Clearly, β and J
will always occur together in this model, in the product
βJ, and we may simply absorb J into the deﬁnition of β.
The ﬁtness f may be normalized to take values between
(0, 1) if we devide the expression in Eq.(1) by the sum
over all states V, namely,

Z ≡

e−βH[{σi}]

.

(4)

X{σi}

This sum may be performed exactly, to give,

Z =

2N − eβλN
2 − eβλ + e[λ(N −1)+1]β
Using this result we may compute the expectation values
m
i=1 σi, which
(average values) of the quantities ψm ≡
we shall call, Ψm = hψmi, for m = 1, . . . , N . Clearly, Ψm
is the probability that in equilibrium, at least m initial
loci on the genotype have switched to 1. One ﬁnds,

+ eβ[(N −1)λ+1]

.

(cid:21)

Clearly, as β → 0, Ψm → (1/2)m, so that it is convenient
to deﬁne the order parameters

Φm =

Ψm − (1/2)m
1 − (1/2)m

,

(7)

which take values in the interval (0, 1).
In Fig. 1, we
present the results of a numerical evaluation of Eq.(6), for
λ = 0, and in Fig.2, for λ = 1, as a function of x ≡ T /J,
which is the ratio of the tolerance in the system to the
strength of the epistatic interactions.

We ﬁnd that for λ = 0, there is a sharp transition
for large N , at x > xt, below which the genotype is
completely ordered, with all σi = 1, while for x > xt, the
whole population is in the the state with all σi = 0. From
an inspection of Eqs.(5,7), one sees that xt = (N ln 2)−1.
Thus there are only two possible species in this case, with
no coexistance between them. However, for N → ∞, the
threshold itself goes to zero. (This can be mended if the

2

strength of the second term in Eq.(3) is chosen to be N J
rather than J.)

For λ = 1, it can be seen that the sharp phase transi-
tion is no longer present (the nonzero value of λ has an
eﬀect similar to turning on a magnetic ﬁeld in a mag-
netic phase transition). For large x, all the Φm decay
exponentially, as ∼ e−m/x. However, there exist eﬀec-
tive thresholds xm, for m > 1, below which there is a
nonzero probability of encountering individuals with m
initial alleles switched to 1. This signiﬁes that at any
given xm+1 < x < xm, there is coexistance between m
hybrid species, with the ﬁrst n ≤ m alleles in the mutated
state. The probability of encountering an individual with
n ≤ m seqentially mutated alleles is in fact precisely Φm.
We see that ΦN ≈ 0 for x > xN , with xN ∼ 1

ln 2 .

To further elucidate the meaning of the “tolerance,”

we may compute the relative variances vm, where

m ≡ h(ψm − Ψm)2i/Ψ2
v2

m .

(8)

It is trivial to note that ψ2

m = ψm, so that v2

m = (1 −

Ψm)/Ψm. Then it is straightforward enough to get,

m

m =

.

(9)

(cid:1)

(eβλ/2)m + (eβλ/2)N

2eβ(λ−1) − eβ − 1
(cid:2)
One may see from here that the beahviour of the sys-
tem is determined by the critical value of βλ at ln 2, and
moreover, that the variance (or the departure from the
ordered phase) also depends on whether m is small or of
the order of N , as can also be seen clearly from Fig. 2.

III. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have presented a hamiltonian model
of multidimensional epistasis which weights only certain
paths in genotype space as being favorable. The model
has tunable strength (J) of interactions between diﬀerent
genes, which can be absorbed into an overall parameter
(β) which determines how tolerant the environment is
to deviations from the wildtype, as well as a parameter
which decides whether coexistance between hybrid indi-
viduals will or will not be allowed. The model exhibits a
transition between two pure types as a function of β for
λ = 0. For λ 6= 0, low tolerances T = β−1 give rise to
the appearance of hybrid types, in case a given series of
mutations increases the ﬁtness.

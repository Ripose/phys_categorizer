Revised version, February 21, 2014

Local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs) are routinely measured experimentally in brain tissue, and exhibit
strong low-pass frequency ﬁltering properties, with high frequencies (such as action potentials)
being visible only at very short distances (≈10 µm) from the recording electrode. Understanding
this ﬁltering is crucial to relate LFP signals with neuronal activity, but not much is known about
the exact mechanisms underlying this low-pass ﬁltering. In this paper, we investigate a possible
biophysical mechanism for the low-pass ﬁltering properties of LFPs. We investigate the propagation
of electric ﬁelds and its frequency dependence close to the current source, i.e. at length scales in
the order of average interneuronal distance. We take into account the presence of a high density
of cellular membranes around current sources, such as glial cells. By considering them as passive
cells, we show that under the inﬂuence of the electric source ﬁeld, they respond by polarisation, i.e.,
creation of an induced ﬁeld. Because of the ﬁnite velocity of charge movement, this polarization
will not be instantaneous. Consequently, the induced electric ﬁeld will be frequency-dependent,
and much reduced for high frequencies. Our model establishes that with respect to frequency
attenuation properties, this situation is analogous to an equivalent RC-circuit, or better a system
of coupled RC-circuits. We present a number of numerical simulations of induced electric ﬁeld for
biologically realistic values of parameters, and show this frequency ﬁltering eﬀect as well as the
attenuation of extracellular potentials with distance. We suggest that induced electric ﬁelds in
passive cells surrounding neurons is the physical origin of frequency ﬁltering properties of LFPs.
Experimentally-testable predictions are provided allowing to verify the validity of this model.

INTRODUCTION

Electric ﬁelds of the brain which are experimentally observable either on the surface of the scalp, or
by microelectrodes, are due to currents in dendrites and the soma of cortical pyramidal cells [1, 2]. Ex-
perimental measurements of electric ﬁelds created in the brain distinguish three scenarios: (i) Local ﬁeld
potentials (LFPs) denote the electric potential recorded locally in the immediate neighborhood of neurons
using microelectrodes of size comparable to the cell body. (ii) The electrocorticogram (ECoG) refers to
measurements of the ﬁeld using electrodes of a diameter of the size of about 1 mm, placed on the cortical
surface. (iii) The electroencephalogram (EEG) is measured at the surface of the scalp using electrodes of a
centimeter scale. In the latter case, the electric potential is recorded after conduction through cerobrospinal
ﬂuid, cranium and scalp, and corresponds to the situation where the source of the electric signals in the
103dnn, where dnn = 0.027 mm
cortex is located far from the site of detection on the scalp (at a scale λ
is the average distance between cortical neurons).

By contrast with the intracellular or membrane potential, which biophysical properties have been exten-
sively studied [3, 4, 5], the mechanisms underlying the genesis of LFPs are still unclear. LFP recordings
routinely show strong high-frequency attenuation properties, because action potentials are only visible for

a few neurons immediately adjacent to the electrode, while low-frequency components results from large
populations of neurons in the local network. Using LFPs, it has been shown that low-frequency oscillations
(0-4 Hz) have a large scale coherence, while the coherence of higher frequency (20-60 Hz) oscillations is
short-ranged. In anesthetized animals, it was shown that oscillations of up to 4 Hz have a coherence range
in the order of several millimeters, while oscillations of 20-60 Hz have a coherence of sub-millimeter range
[6, 7]. The local coherence of high frequency oscillations was also shown in the visual system of anesthetized
cats, where gamma-oscillations (30-50 Hz) appear only within restricted cortical areas and time windows
[8, 9]. The same diﬀerence of coherence between low and high frequency oscillations was also demonstrated
in non-anesthetized animals, respectively during sleep in a state of low-frequency wave and waking [10].
Similar ﬁndings have been reported for human EEG [11].

A full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the genesis of EEG and LFP signals is required to
relate these signals with neuronal activity. Several models of EEG or LFP activity have been proposed
previously (e.g., see [1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]). These models always considered current sources embedded
in a homogeneous extracellular ﬂuid. In such homogeneous media, however, there cannot be any frequency
ﬁltering property. Extracellular space consists of a complex folding of intermixed layers of ﬂuids and
membranes, while the extracellular ﬂuid represents only a few percent of the available space [19, 20]. Due
to the complex nature of this medium, it is very diﬃcult to draw theories or to model LFPs properly, and
one needs to make approximations. In a previous paper [18], we considered current sources with various
continuous proﬁles of conductivity according to a spherical symmetry, and showed that it can lead to
low-pass frequency ﬁltering. This showed that strong inhomogeneities in conductivity and permittivity in
extracellular space can lead to low-pass frequency ﬁltering, but this approach was not satisfactory because
high-pass ﬁlters could also be obtained, in contradiction to experiments. In addition, this model predicted
frequency attenuation which was not quantitative, as action potentials were still visible at 1 mm distance,
which is in contrast to what is observed experimentally.

In the present paper, we go one step further and consider an explicit structure of extracellular space, in
which we study the interaction of the electric ﬁeld with the membranes surrounding neurons. Neurons are
sourrounded by densely packed membranes of other neurons and glial cells [19, 20, 21], a situation which we
approximate here by considering a series of passive spherical membranes around the source, all embedded
in a conducting ﬂuid. We show that the frequency dependence can be determined by the membranes of
such passive cells and the phenomenon of electric polarisation.

II. GENERAL THEORY

A. Model of extracellular space

In this section, we give a general overview of the structure of the model, as well as of its parameters. In
Ref.[18], we considered a model where the electrical properties of extracellular space are described by two
parameters only: conductivity σ and permittivity ǫ. Both, σ and ǫ were considered to vary with location
subject to some ad hoc assumptions. Vω, the frequency ω component of the electric potential V obtained
by a Fourier transformation of the potential as function of time, was shown to obey the equation

∆Vω + (~
∇

Vω)

(

·

~
(σ + iωǫ)
∇
(σ + iωǫ)

) = 0 .

(1)

The physical behavior of the solution is essentially determined by the expression 1 + iω ǫ
σ . When a strong
inhomogeneity occurs, one may have ω ǫ
σ >> 1. This means that a strong phase diﬀerence may exist between
electric current and potential, i.e. a large impedance. In a neurophysiological context, such behavior is
likely to occur at the interface between the extracellular ﬂuid (high conductivity) and the membranes of cells
(low conductivity). This situation was considered previously in the context of a simpliﬁed representation of
extracellular space, in which the inhomogeneities of conductivity were assumed to be of spherical symmetry

3

around the source [18]. Moreover, the equation above assumes that the charge density of the extracellular
medium is zero when its potential is zero, which is not entirely true since there are positive charges on the
exterior surface of neuronal membranes at rest.

In the present work, we consider an explicit structure of extracellular space as a system in which the source
(neuron) is surrounded by passive cells, all embedded in a conducting ﬂuid. Neurons are characterized by
various voltage-dependent and synaptic ion channels, and they will be considered here as the source of the
electric ﬁeld in extracellular space. On the other hand, glial cells are very densely packed in interneuronal
space, sometimes surrounding the soma or the dendrites of neurons [20, 21]. Glial cells normally do not have
dominant voltage-dependent channel activity, and they rather play a role in maintaining extracellular ionic
concentrations. Like neurons, they have an excess of negative charges inside the cell, which is responsible
for a negative resting potential (for most central neurons, this resting membrane potential is around -60
to -80 mV). They will be considered here as “passive”. We will show that such passive cells, which can
represent glial cells or any other cell type characterized by a resting membrane potential, can be polarized
by the electric ﬁeld produced by neurons. This polarization has an inertia and a characteristic relaxation
time which may have important consequences to the properties of propagation of local ﬁeld potentials.
We will also take into account the extracellular ﬂuid, which plays the role of a conducting medium, i.e.
allows for the ﬂow of electric currents. In the remainder of this text, we will use the term “passive cell”
to represent the various cell types around neurons, but bearing in mind that they may represent other
neurons as well.

Another simpliﬁcation is that we consider these passive cells as spherical. Such a simpliﬁcation is justiﬁed
and motivated by the objective to model the dynamics of neurons and passive cells in extracellular space
with the goal to understand the essential physical principles. As we do not attempt here a quantitative
description, we neglect the detailed morphology of neurons and glial cells (for instance we neglect the
star-shaped extension of astrocytes) which we consider in our model as second order eﬀects.

The arrangement of charges around a passive cell is schematized in Fig.[1A], where we delimited 5
regions. The membrane of the passive cell (Region 3) separates the intracellular ﬂuid (Region 5) from the
extracellular ﬂuid (Region 1), both of which are electrically neutral. The negative charges in excess in the
intracellular medium agglutinate in the region immediately adjacent to the membrane (Region 4), while the
analogous region at the exterior surface of the membrane (Region 2) contains the positive ions in excess in
the extracellular space. This arrangement results in a charge distribution (schematized in Fig.[1B]) which
creates a strong electric ﬁeld inside the membrane.

The behavior of such a system depends on the values of conductivity and permittivity in these diﬀerent
regions (they are considered constant within each region). The extracellular ﬂuid (Region 1) has good
−1meter−1, consistent with
electric conductance properties. We have taken as conductivity σ = 4 Ohm
−1meter−1, taken from measurements of speciﬁc impedance of rabbit
biological data σ = 3.3
cerebral cortex [22]. This value is comparable to the conductivity of salt water (σsw = 2.5 Ohm−1 meter−1).
10−12 Farad/meter
The permittivity is given by ǫ =70 ǫ0, corresponding to salt water. Here ǫ0 = 8.854
denotes the permittivity of the vacuum. In Region 2, to the our best knowledge, there are no experimental
−1meter−1
data on conductivity close to the membrane. We have chosen the values of σ = 1.3
and ǫ = 1.1
12 ǫ0 for Region 2. Such a choice is not inconsistent with biological
observations. First, electron microscopic photographs taken from the region near the membrane reﬂect very
little light, which hints to quite low conductivity compared to the conductivity of Region 1. We consider
it as plausible that permittivity in Region 2 should be smaller than in Region 1. Our choice of σ and ǫ
corresponds to a Maxwell time TMaxw yielding a cut-oﬀ frequency fc
100 Hz, which was also the choice
given in a previous study investigating composite materials [23].

For passive cells, we neglect ion channels and pumps located in the membrane, which is equivalent to
assume the absence of any electric current across the membrane. Therefore, Region 3 has zero conductivity
perpendicular to the membrane surface. The capacity of a cellular membrane has been measured and is
about C = 10−2 Farad/meter2 [4]. Approximating the membrane by a parallel plates capacitor (with
surface S and distance d, obeying C = ǫS/d), one estimates the electric permittivity of membrane to
ǫ = 10−10 Farad/meter. Hence we used the parameters σ = 0, and ǫ = 12 ǫ0.

FIG. 1: Scheme of charge distribution around the membrane of a passive cell. A. Charge distribution at rest. The
following regions are deﬁned: the extracellular ﬂuid (Region 1), the region immediately adjacent to the exterior of
the membrane where positive charges are concentrated (Region 2), the membrane (Region 3, in gray), the region
immediately adjacent to the interior of the membrane where negative charges are concentrated (Region 4), and
the intracellular (cytoplasmic) ﬂuid (Region 5). B. Schematic representation of the charge density as a function of
distance (along the horizontal dotted line in A). C. Redistribution of charges in the presence of an electric ﬁeld.
The ions move away from or towards the source, according to their charge, resulting in a polarization of the cell.
D. Schematic representation of the charge density predicted from C.

Thus, the basic idea behind the model is as follows. As represented in Fig.[1], we consider a single
spherical passive cell under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld will induce a polarisation
of the cell by reorganizing its charge distribution (Fig.[1C-D]). This polarisation will create a secondary
electric ﬁeld, with ﬁeld lines connecting those opposite charges. It is customary notation to call the original
electric ﬁeld the source ﬁeld, or the primary ﬁeld, while the ﬁeld due to polarisation is called the induced
ﬁeld, or the secondary ﬁeld. The physical electric ﬁeld is the sum (in the sense of vectors) of both, the
source and the induced ﬁeld. This induced ﬁeld will be highly dependent on frequency, for high frequencies,
the “inertia” of charge movement in Regions 2 and 4 will limit such a polarisation, and will reduce the
eﬀect of induced ﬁeld. This phenomenon is at the basis of the model of frequency-dependent local ﬁeld
potentials presented in this article.

B. Dynamical equations and method of computation

We introduce here the toolbox of physics used for the construction of our model, in which we consider
neurons as the principal sources of electric current. In electrodynamics, one distinguishes between a current
source and a potential source. A current source, e.g. in an electric circuit, means that if the electric current
is used to do some work, the source maintains its level of current. Likewise, a potential source maintains

5

its electric potential. Although neurons are generally considered as current sources, here we have chosen to
consider them as potential sources, for the following reasons. First, these two type of sources are equivalent
for calculating extracellular potentials. The electric potential within a given region D depends on the limit
conditions at the border of this region, and not by the type of source (current vs. potential source). Second,
it is much easier to calculate the potential using limit conditions on the potential (Dirichlet conditions)
than using limit conditions with currents (Neumann conditions). Third, potentials are better constrained
from experiments and their range of values is better known than currents (for example the amplitude of
membrane potential variations in neurons is of the order of 10-20 mV for subthreshold activity, and of
about 100 mV during spikes).

Let us suppose that we are given a source of electric ﬁeld, representing a neuron with some open ion
channels. The motion of ions through those channels gives a current density, and also creates a distribution
of charges (ions). According to the Maxwell equations, a given distribution of currents and charges (plus
information on the polarisation and induction properties of the medium) determines the magnetic ﬁeld,
the electric ﬁeld and hence the electric potential. In a ﬁrst step, we consider the eﬀect of the electric ﬁeld
on a single passive cell.

The source electric ﬁeld is the origin of two physical phenomena. First, the electric ﬁeld exerts a force on
charged particles (ions) and thus creates a motion of charge carriers, i.e. an electric current. Second, the
electric ﬁeld creates a displacement of charges in the borderline region of the membrane of the passive cell
(Region 2). This displacement creates an induced potential due to polarisation. However, this polarisation
is not instantaneous, due to the “inertia” of charge movements. The charges on the membrane move
relatively slowly, which will be responsible for a slow time dependence of the polarisation, before reaching
equilibrium. The characteristic time scale of such a process is given by Maxwell’s relaxation time TMaxw
(see Eq.[8] below), which depends on the properties of the medium, like resistivity and permittivity. The
temporal behavior of the source is dynamic, which can characterized by some characteristic time scale
Tsource. E.g., during the creation of an action potential, ion channels open and ionic currents ﬂow, the
electric ﬁeld and potential changes. After a certain time the neuron source goes back to its state of rest.
This means that the electric current will vanish after some delay. For example, in a typical neuron, the
width of the action potential is typically of the order of 2 msec. The polarisation and relaxation dynamics
of the passive cell depends on both time scales, Tsource and TMaxw. This situation holds in the case of an
ideal dielectric medium (conductivity zero, for example pure water). In the extracellular medium, however,
conductivity is non-zero. As a consequence, the polarisation potential and the current distribution will
mutually inﬂuence each other.

Thus, we face the question: How do we quantitatively calculate the electric ﬁeld and potential in such a
medium? And what is its time-dependence and frequency-dependence? Looking at the temporal behavior,
there are two diﬀerent regimes from the biological point of view. First, there is the transitory regime which
describes the short period of opening and shutting down of the source and its response of the medium with
some delay. Second, there is the so-called asymptotic or permanent regime, where no current ﬂows. From
the computational point of view, we ﬁnd it convenient to describe the transitory behavior of the source by
a function approximated by a number of step functions (or Heaviside functions). This will be discussed
below.

C. Asymptotic behavior in Region 1

Let us start by considering the behavior in Region 1 when the system has settled into an asymptotic
regime. It means that charges move and after some time attach to the surface of the passive cell membrane
(Region 2). We call this a stationary or equilibrium regime.
In this region, the electric properties are
characterized by permittivity ǫ and conductivity σ. We assume that these electric properties are identical
everywhere inside Region 1, i.e. permittivity ǫ and conductivity σ are constant.

To describe this situation, we start by recalling the fundamental equations of electrodynamics. Gauss’

law reads

Moreover, because σ is constant, there is Ohm’s law,

Expressing the electric ﬁeld in terms of the potential, and using Ohm’s law, we can express Gauss’ law and
the continuity equation in the following form,

Combining both equations and recalling that ǫ and σ are both constant in Region 1 implies the following
diﬀerential equation for the charge density,

A particular solution to this equation requires to specify boundary conditions and initial conditions. Here
the boundary conditions are such that the electric ﬁeld (the component of the ﬁeld perpendicular to the
surface) on the surface of the source and on the surface of the passive cell is given (Dirichlet boundary
conditions). The general solution of Eq.[6] is

i.e., with increasing time the charge distribution goes exponentially to zero. The time scale, which charac-
terizes the exponential law, is Maxwell’s time of relaxation,

In the limit of large time, the continuity equation implies ~
~j = 0, i.e. there are no sources or sinks. Also
in this limit the electric potential satisﬁes Laplace’s equation, ∆V = 0, which follows from Gauss’ law.
Maxwell’s relaxation time for Region 1 is very fast, of the order of 10−10 s, thus the charge density tends
very quickly to zero, as does the extracellular potential.

∇ ·

D. Behavior in Region 2

Region 2 is the near neighborhood of the membrane of a passive cell. The neuronal source creates the
source ﬁeld (or primary ﬁeld) ~Esource. As pointed out above (Fig.[1C]), due to the presence of a source and
the presence of free charges near the passive cell membrane, there will be a polarisation of the free charges,
described by an electric induced ﬁeld (or secondary ﬁeld) ~Eind also denoted by ~Ef ree. Let us assume that

the source ﬁeld is ”switched on” at time t = 0. Such time-dependence is described by a Heaviside step
function H(t) (see Eq.[54] in the Appendix).

~Esource(~x, t) = ~E0(~x) H(t) .

The electric ﬁeld present in Region 2 results from the source ﬁeld ~Esource, the ﬁeld due to free charges
~Ef ree (which create the induced ﬁeld) and the ﬁeld due to ﬁxed localized charges (dipoles) of the membrane
~Emembr. Under the hypothesis that the passive cell membrane is a rigid structure with dipoles in ﬁxed
location and under the assumption that ion channels in that membrane remain closed, we conclude that
the electric ﬁeld ~Emembr does not vary in time. The following laws hold,

While ρf ree depends on position and time, the function f (~x) denotes a time-independent term ( ~Emembr is
time-independent and ~Esource is time-independent for t > 0). The solution of Eq.[12] becomes

ρf ree(~x, t) = a(~x) + b(~x) exp[

t/TMaxw]

for t > 0 .

(13)

The function a(~x) represents the free charge density at equilibrium, that is a long time (t =
) after the
source has been switched on and the free charges have settled in Region 1 in such a way that in Region
1 no net electric ﬁeld is left and hence no ﬂow of electric current occurs. The function b(~x) denotes the
diﬀerence of the free charge density at the moment when switching on the source and the free charge
density at equilibrium. One should note that ρf ree(~x, t) is a continuous function in ~x at t = 0. Poisson’s
equation implies that a linear relation holds between the free charge density and the induced potential.
This and Eq.[13] yields

Vind(~x, t) = c(~x) + d(~x) exp[

for t > 0 .

In order to understand the meaning of the functions c(~x) and d(~x), let us consider as example the following
particular boundary conditions,

−

−

Vsource(~x, t) = α for t < 0 ,
Vsource(~x, t) = β for t > 0 ,

where α and β are taken as constant in space and time. Then the induced potential becomes

where Vsource(~x, t = +δ) denotes the source potential, Eq.[15], immediately after the source has been

Now let us consider more speciﬁcally a source with time-dependence given by the following function,

Vsource(~x, t) =

H(t)] case(b) ,

(cid:26)

where H(t) denotes the Heaviside step function (deﬁned in the Appendix). In case (a), the source potential
is constant (= β) in space and jumps from zero to one in time at t = 0, meaning the source is switched
on. In case (b), the source potential is constant (= α) in space and jumps from one to zero in time at
t = 0, meaning the source is switched oﬀ. By repetition of alternate switch-on’s and switch-oﬀ’s, one can
introduce a temporal pattern with a certain frequency, as shown in Fig.[2A]. Here we are interested in the
temporal behavior of the induced potential under such circumstances. In case (a) Eq.[16] implies for the
induced potential the following relation

By diﬀerentiation, one ﬁnds that the induced potential obeys the following diﬀerential equation,

E. Source given by oscillating step function: an equivalent RC electric circuit

Previously, we considered initial conditions where the source has been switched on at some time. This can
be directly generalized to the temporal behavior of a periodic step function, say with a period T , as shown in
Fig.[2A]. The corresponding induced potential, presented in Fig.[2B], shows a piecewise exponential increase
followed by an exponential decrease. The ﬁgure compares the responses for oscillating step functions with
diﬀerent periodicity T . One observes the following behavior. At the top of the ﬁgure the period T is
smallest, i.e. which corresponds to a rapid oscillation about its time average. At the bottom of the ﬁgure
the period T is largest, corresponding to a low-frequency oscillation.
It is important to note that the
amplitude of oscillation (i.e. the diﬀerence between its maximal and minimal value) is much smaller for
small T than for large T . This yields the attenuation eﬀect of high frequencies in the induced potential.

Such behavior of the induced potential is well known from and mathematically equivalent to that of an
RC electric circuit, with a resistor R and a capacitor C (see Fig.[3]). The equation of motion in such an
RC circuit relating the induced potential V C
ind to the capacity C to the source potential Vsource is given by

Thus, for each point ~x near the membrane of a passive cell (Region 2 in Fig.[1A]), we can set up an
equivalent electric circuit, which is equivalent in the sense that it gives a diﬀerential equation with the
same mathematical solution as for the induced potential of the original system of a source and a passive
cell.

Induced potential for time dependent source

The analogue of an RC electric circuit can be used to determine the characteristic properties of the
source/passive-cell system, like the cut-oﬀ frequency. For that purpose let us consider the source potential
to be given by a periodic function of sinusoidal type,

Vsource(~x, t) = V0(~x) exp(iωt) .

for various values of the period T = 2π/ω of the driving potential. In the case T << TM axw (top), the induced
potential ﬂuctuates closely around the mean value of the driving potential. In the case T >> TM axw (bottom) the
induced potential relaxes and ﬂuctuates between Vmin = 0 and Vmax = 100 of the driving potential. As a result,
the amplitude of oscillation becomes more attenuated with increased frequency f = 1/T .

dependence of a function is decomposed in terms of function exp(iωt), has been proven very useful in the
time-analysis of experimental date (e.g. the power spectrum). An alternative method is the Heaviside

as a function of frequency based on the analogy with an equivalent electric circuit with a resistor R and
capacity C arranged in serial order. A series of detailed numerical simulations, modeling frequency ﬁltering
of extra-cellular neural tissue in the neighborhood of passive cells in terms of the electric circuit model,
Eq.[26], using physiologically realistic parameters of ǫ and σ are shown in Fig.[5]. They present the signal
coming from an oscillating step function with a period Tstep = 10 msec, i.e. a frequency of 100 Hz. Going
from Fig.[5A] to Fig.[5C] Tstep is kept ﬁxed but TMaxw increases, i.e. Tstep/TMaxw decreases. Fig.[5A]
corresponds to the case where the relaxation time TMaxw is 10 times smaller than the period of the signal
Tstep. In Fig.[5B] TMaxw and Tstep are equal, and in Fig.[5C] TMaxw is 10 times larger than Tstep. We
observe that the shape of the signal after ﬁltering is more or less intact for Tstep/TMaxw = 10 and becomes
gradually more deformed when going over to Tstep/TMaxw = 0.1. As the Fourier transformation after
ﬁltering shows, the higher frequency components get gradually more suppressed. This represents a low
frequency band pass.

Interpretation of model in terms of Faraday’s cage

Let us recall from electrostatics the phenomenon of Faraday’s cage: We consider a closed conducting
(metal) surface. The metal is neutral, i.e., the total electric charge on the surface is zero. After some time,
the free electric charges on the surface will arrange their positions and do no longer move. This is the
so-called state of equilibrium. In such state there is no electric ﬁeld in the space interior to the conducting
surface. This is known as the phenomenon of Faraday’s cage. Likewise, we may place a source of electric
ﬁeld, for example a positive point charge Q, exterior to the conducting surface. Now the source ﬁeld
penetrates the conductor, the free charges begin to move and arrange themselves after some time in a such
a way that negative free charges will accumulate on the surface near to the positive charge Q, and negative
free charges will accumulate on the opposite side. This phenomenon of polarisation creates an induced
electric ﬁeld. When the state of equilibrium is reached, there will be no net electric ﬁeld in the space
interior to the conducting surface, because the source ﬁeld and the induced ﬁeld will cancel each other.
Again we have a Faraday cage. The physical principle, which is responsible for the cancellation of source
and induced ﬁeld is the principle of minimization of electromagnetic energy. In the state of equilibrium,
the density of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld is distributed in such a way that the total electromagnetic
energy becomes minimal.

As discussed above, a similar situation prevails for the electric ﬁelds in and around passive cells, in
the framework of our model. The point charge Q then corresponds to a source of electric ﬁeld due to
a neuron. After the source has been switched on, which in our model has been described by a step
function (Heaviside) in time, the source ﬁeld penetrates the passive cell. The free charges found near the
exterior surface of its membrane start to move and after some time settle in positions, which minimizes
the electromagnetic energy. In such equilibrium distribution, positive and negative charges are separated
and create polarisation, i.e. an induced electric ﬁeld is created which counterbalances the source electric
ﬁeld. After equilibrium has been reached, there is no more electric current ﬂowing around the passive cell.
Thus there is no net electric ﬁeld left. Likewise in the region interior to the membrane (Region 4) there is
no electric ﬁeld left. The system can be viewed as a Faraday cage.

III. MODELING FREQUENCY-DEPENDENCE OF MULTIPLE NEURONS AND PASSIVE
CELLS

A. Frequency dependence for multiple neurons and passive cells

So far we treated only the case of a single source and a single passive cell. We studied frequency
dependence in the framework of the RC circuit model of this system. Now we will generalize this to
D=3 spatial dimensions, taking into account a simpliﬁed geometry of neural sources and passive cells.
We consider the neuron source in the shape of a cube of length Lneuron. Likewise, we consider the
passive cells as represented by cubes of length Lpass. Let us assume that the neuron source and the
passive cell are located at some distance d from each other. This geometry, although being far from
realistic, however, facilitates numerical simulations. Let us keep in mind that the aim of this work is not to
make quantitative predictions but rather to construct a model which qualitatively explains the frequency
attenuation properties of extracellular neuronal tissue.

Let us outline the method of numerical computation of the potential. Firstly, the solution of a partial

14

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

diﬀerential equation requires to specify suitable boundary conditions. A suitable choice is to impose that
the solution V satisﬁes certain values on the boundary, represented by the surface of all cells. However,
the problem is that the functional values of the potential can not be chosen freely. The physical solution
(being such that it minimizes the electric energy) also imposes constraints on the boundary conditions.
The boundary conditions which specify the physical electric ﬁeld are such that the total electromagnetic
energy becomes minimal.

Those physical boundary conditions are not a priori known. Those physical boundary conditions are
equivalent to the condition that Gauss’ integral summing the ﬂux around a charge source becomes invariant
when the integration surface is changed. A possibly strategy to ﬁnd those boundary conditions is to use
a variational principle, starting from some initial guess of boundary conditions and then to adjust the
boundary conditions until eventually the total electric energy attains its minimum.

We used a variational principle via the following iterative scheme. In the ﬁrst step, we compute the
potential due to the source in absence of any passive cell in the asymptotic regime (a long time after the
source has been switched on), for the case where the source has no frequency dependence (ω = 0). We
assume that the potential obeys the boundary condition on the surface of the neuron source

V (~x) = V 0 = const

for ~x on surface of source .

The potential satisﬁes Laplace’s equation

∆V (~x) = 0 .

The numerical solution has been carried out using the standard method of relaxation.

In the second step we place a passive cell at some distance d from the neuron source. We want to calculate
the induced potential due to the presence of the passive cell. We proceed in the following way. Let us
consider for a moment that the passive cell is small compared to the size of the neuron, Lpass << Lneuron.
Then the induced potential on the surface of the passive cell would be almost identical to V center
, the
potential created by the source alone, evaluated at the center of the passive cell. Then imposing the
boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the passive cell takes the value V center
pass would be
very close to the exact solution. Now we consider the passive cell no longer as tiny. Then imposing the
boundary condition boundary on the surface of the passive cell

pass

V (~x) = V center

pass = const ~x on surface of passive cell

becomes an approximation.

In a third step, taking into account that the potential obeys the boundary conditions on the neuron
source and on the passive cell, Eqs.[34,36], we solve again Laplace’s equation, Eq.[35]. Now we test if the
obtained solution V (~x, t) is the correct solution. Using Gauss’ theorem, one has

d~s

~E =

~E .

∇

Here the integral denotes an integral over a closed surface, ﬁrst englobing the neuron source and second
englobing the neuron source plus the passive cell. The electric ﬁeld is related to the potential by ~E(~x, t) =
V (~x, t). Because the passive cell has a total charge Qpass = 0, Eq.[37] should be satisﬁed by the
−
physical solution Vphys(~x, t). As long as V (~x, t) diﬀers from Vphys(~x, t), one has to adjust the potential on
the surface of the passive cell, solve again Laplace’s equation and verify the charge balance Eq.[37]. This
a an iterative process, which turned out to converge quite fast towards the physical solution.

This method can be applied as well to treat multiple neuron sources and multiple passive cells. We would
like to point out that the extracellular neural tissue is composed of much more passive cells than neurons.
On average the number of glial cells per unit volume is higher than the number of neurons per unit volume
by about a factor of 10. The physical consequence of this property is that the induced potential due to the
presence of passive cell becomes more important than the source potential.

Finally, let us consider what happens when the source becomes time-dependent. The previous calcula-
tions correspond to a time-independent source. As we are interested in frequency dependence of the elec-
tric ﬁeld, where the source is time-dependent, one has to redo the above computations for time-dependent
sources. Due to the fact that we consider in 3-D a relatively complicated arrangement of several sources and
passive cells, those computations would be quite costly in computer time. However, in order to estimate
the eﬀect of frequency ﬁltering, we have proceeded in the following way. According to Eq.[30], the transfer
function FT M expresses the ratio of the induced potential, where the source has a time-dependence given
by exp(iωt), over the induced potential, where the source has no time-dependence (ω = 0). We can write
this as

V ω
ind(~x, t)
|

| ∼

t→∞

FT M (~x, ω)
|

| × |

V ω=0

.

Thus we obtain the induced potential due to a source of frequency ω, if we know the induced potential
due to a source of frequency zero and also the transfer function. The induced potential due to a source
of frequency zero has been computed following the strategy outlined above. For the transfer function we
have taken the expression given by Eq.[31]. Numerical results are presented in the next section.

(38)

B. Numerical results

Here we present results of numerical solutions of Laplace’s equation for the scenario of zero conductivity
and constant permittivity in the presence of several sources and several passive cells, where the sources are
time-independent. The goal is to show that the induced potential gives an important contribution to the
total, i.e. physical potential. The results are presented in Figs.[6–9]. For the case of a single source and a
single passive cell the source potential, the induced potential and the total potential are shown in Fig.[6A-
C], respectively. Comparing the source potential (B) with the induced potential (C), one observes that the
latter gives a substantial contribution. In Fig.[7A-D] we show the induced potential multiplied with the
norm of the transfer function. We observe that the frequency-dependent induced potential decreases when
the frequency of the source increases from 0 to 400 Hz. Qualitatively the same results are obtained in the
case of two sources and a single passive cell (not shown). Again we observe for the time-independent source
that the induced potential is non-negligible compared to the source potential and the frequency-dependent
induced potential rapidly decreases when the frequency goes from 0 to 400 Hz. Figs.
[8–9] show the
corresponding results in the case of a single source and six passive cells. We observe qualitatively the same
results as in Fig.[6]. These results demonstrate clearly the phenomenon of attenuation of high frequencies
in the induced potential.

IV. ATTENUATION AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE

In this section, we calculate the attenuation with distance for inﬁnitely low frequencies (constant source),
in a simpliﬁed geometry of sources and passive cells. We start by calculating the electric potential at the
surface of a passive cell, then we use this expression to calculate the distance dependence of this potential
assuming a geometry of densely packed spheres.

A. Electric potential at the surface of passive membranes at equilibrium

Let us assume a spherical passive cell embedded in a perfect dielectric medium, and exposed to a constant
electric ﬁeld. At equilibrium, we have seen above that the eﬀect of the electric ﬁeld is to polarize the charge
distribution at the surface of the cell, such as to create a secondary electric ﬁeld (see Fig.[ 1B]), but the

induced electric ﬁeld is zero inside the cell. In this case, the conservation of charges on the surface implies:

where ρSurf is the charge density on the surface of the cell. The resulting electric potential is given by:

ρSurf dS = 0 ,

where Vsource is the electric potential due to the source ﬁeld, Vtot is the total resulting electric potential
due to the source ﬁeld and the induced ﬁeld, and r is the distance from point (x, y, z) to the center of the
cell. Because at the center of the cell, (a, b, c), we necessarily have r = R (where R is the cell’s radius), the
value of the resulting electric potential at the center is given by:

Vtot(a, b, c) = Vsource(a, b, c) +

dS = Vsource(a, b, c) .

Thus, the electric potential at the surface of a spheric passive cell at equilibrium equals the potential due
to the primary ﬁeld at the center of the cell. In other words, the eﬀect of the secondary ﬁeld in this case
perfectly compensates the distance dependence of the primary ﬁeld, such as the surface of the cell becomes
isopotential, as discussed above.

0, 100, 200, 400 Hz in A,B,C,D, respectively). The induced potential tends to zero when f increases.

B. Attenuation of electric potential in a system of packed spheres

Keeping the assumption of a constant electric ﬁeld, we now calculate how the extracellular potential
varies as a function of distance in a simpliﬁed geometry. We consider a system of packed spheres as
indicated in Fig.[10]. From the solution of Laplace’s equation, the extracellular potential at a distance r
from the source center is given by:

where k is a constant, which is evaluated from the potential at the surface of the source (S0 in Fig.[10A]):

where R is the radius of the source. Thus, the potential due to the source ﬁeld at a given point r in
extracellular space is given by:

Considering the arrangement of Fig.[10A], if all cells of a given layer are equidistant from the source,
their surface will be at the same potential (see Section [IV A]), which we approximate as a series of
isopotential concentric surfaces (S1, S2 ... Sn in Fig.[10A]). A given layer (n) of isopotential cells is
therefore approximated by a new spherical source of radius rn, which will polarize cells in the following
layer (n + 1). According to such a scheme, the potential in layer n + 1 is given by:

electric potential, C: Induced electric potential Vind.

where dn+1 is the distance from the center of cells in layer (n + 1) to the center of the source. According
to the scheme of Fig.[10A], we have rn = (2n + 1)R and dn = 2nR. Thus, we can write the following
recurrence relation:

Consequently:

Vn+1 =

Thus, in a system of densely packed spherical cells, the extracellular potential falls-oﬀ like 1/√r (Fig.[10B],

In contrast, in the absence of passive cells in extracellular space, the electric potential is given by the

source ﬁeld only (Eq.[44]), which, using the same distance notations as above, is given by:

Vn+1 =

FIG. 9: Same as Fig.[8], but showing the induced potential Vind for a time dependent source at diﬀerent oscillation
frequencies (f = 0, 100, 200, 400 Hz in A,B,C,D, respectively).

Such 1/r behavior is illustrated in Fig.[10B] (dashed line). Note that other theories predict a steeper decay.
For instance the Debye-H¨uckel theory of ionic solutions [25] predicts a fall-oﬀ as exp(

kr)/r.

Thus, for this particular conﬁguration, there is an important diﬀerence in the attenuation of extracel-
lular potential with distance. The extracellular potential in a system of densely packed spheres falls-oﬀ
approximately like 1/√r, in contrast to a 1/r behavior in a homogeneous extracellular ﬂuid. Note that a
1/√r behavior can also be found in a system in which the source is deﬁned as a current. For a constant
current source I0, with variations of conductivity following a spherical symmetry around the source, the
extracellular potential is given by [18]:

−

where σ(r) is the radial proﬁle of conductivity around the source. Assuming that σ(r) = σ0/√r, gives

Consequently, the 1/√r behavior found above is functionally equivalent to a medium with conductivity

varying like 1/√r. This “eﬀective conductivity” is similar to that introduced in a previous study [18].

V. DISCUSSION

From theoretical considerations and numerical simulations we have obtained the following main results:
(i) Neuronal sources polarize the cells surrounding neurons, which gives rise to an induced electric ﬁeld
which adds to the electric ﬁeld directly produced by the sources. This induced ﬁeld is non-negligible for
biologically realistic parameters. (ii) This induced electric ﬁeld has strong frequency dependent properties.

FIG. 10: Extracellular potentials as a function of distance for a system of densely packed spherical cells. A. Scheme
of the arrangement of successive layers of identical passive cells packed around a source (in gray). The potential of
the source is indicated by V0. V1, V2 ... Vn indicate the potential at the surface of passive cells in layers 1,2,...n,
respectively. The dotted lines indicate isopotential surfaces, which are concentric spheres centered around the
source, and which are indicated here by S1, S2 ... Sn. B. Extracellular potential as a function of distance (in units
of cell radius), comparing two cases: with induction (solid line, corresponding to the arrangement schematized in
A), and without induction (dashed line; source surrounded by conductive ﬂuid only). Both cases predict a diﬀerent
scaling of the electric potential with distance (see text for details).

This system is equivalent to an equivalent RC circuit and always has low-pass ﬁltering properties. (iii)
The cut-oﬀ frequency of this low-pass ﬁlter is determined by Maxwell’s relaxation time of the membrane
surfaces surrounding neuronal sources. (iv) Consequently, the attenuation of high frequencies will not be
inﬂuenced by this induced ﬁeld, and will be the same as if neurons were embedded in a homogeneous
extracellular medium. On the other hand, the attenuation of low frequencies will depend on the induced
ﬁeld, and will therefore depend on the geometry of ﬂuids and membranes in the extracellular space.

In previous work, we showed that inhomogeneities of conductivity or permittivity in extracellular space
could give rise to strong frequency ﬁltering properties [18]. However, low-pass or high-pass ﬁlters could be
obtained depending on the proﬁles of conductivity used in this model. In the present model, a low-pass
ﬁlter is predicted, consistent with experiments (which never evidenced a high-pass ﬁlter). However, the fact
that frequency ﬁltering properties are due to the alternance of high-conductive ﬂuids and low-conductive
membranes in the present model is compatible with the inhomogeneity of conductivity postulated in the
previous model. The main diﬀerence with the previous model is that we considered here explicitly a
non-zero charge density on neighboring membranes.

Another similarity with the previous model concerns the mechanism of attenuation of LFPs with distance.

21

The primary or source ﬁeld experiences a steep attenuation for all frequencies, and the electric potential
will attenuate with distance r following a 1/r law, similar to the attenuation in a homogeneous conducting
ﬂuid [1]. On the other hand, the induced ﬁeld will be subject to a diﬀerent law of attenuation with distance,
which will depend on the spatial arrangement of passive cells around the source. In the previous model
it depended on the particular conductivity proﬁle [18]. In general, for densely packed cellular membranes
around the source, one will have a law of attenuation which will be of 1/rα, where α < 1 may depend on the
frequency ω. For example, we found α
0.5 for spherical cells in Fig.[10]) for low ω. Thus, both models
predict the following scenario: high frequencies follow an attenuation in 1/r, similar to a homogeneous
extracellular ﬂuid, but low frequencies follow a slower attenuation proﬁle, because these frequencies are
“transported” by the induced ﬁeld.

∼

It should be noted that this model represents a strong approximation of the actual complexity of the
mechanisms involved in LFP generation. A ﬁrst approximation was to consider passive cells as spheres,
neglecting their morphological complexity. Another assumption was that the electric ﬁeld results only
from neuronal current sources, while other cell types, such as glial cells, also contains ion channels and
may inﬂuence LFPs. A third approximation was to neglect the eﬀect of variations of extracellular ionic
concentrations (like potassium buﬀering by glial cells), which may also inﬂuence LFP activity, especially at
low frequencies (in addition to local variations of conductivity). It is diﬃcult to estimate the consequences
of these diﬀerent approximations, but the polarization eﬀects described here should occur in more complex
situations, so it is likely that the present considerations apply to more complex geometries and current
sources. This should be tested by numerical simulations, for example by constraining the model with 3D
reconstructions of extracellular space from electron microscopic measurements.

The scenario outlined above of a “transport” of low frequencies can be tested experimentally in diﬀerent
ways. First, measuring the decay of speciﬁc frequency components of LFPs with distance, and in partic-
ular how they diﬀer from the 1/r law, should yield direct information on how much extracellular space
deviates from a homogeneous conducting ﬂuid. The attenuation proﬁle should also depend on the spatial
arrangement of successive ﬂuids and membranes in the extracellular ﬂuid. It is conceivable to inject sinu-
soidal currents (of low amplitude to allow induction eﬀects) of diﬀerent frequencies using a microelectrode
and measure the LFP produced at increasing distances, to obtain the law of attenuation as a function of
frequency (i.e., α(ω)). The comparison with model predictions should tell us to what extent the model
predicts the correct attenuation.

The equivalent RC circuit investigated above also deserves some comment. It is well known that an
electric circuit consisting of a resistor and a capacitor, which stores electric energy, introduces a phase
diﬀerence between current and potential, and has characteristic low-pass ﬁltering properties. The fact that
such a simple RC circuit may be used as a model of frequency ﬁltering of cerebral tissue, however, is more
surprising. In fact, if we construct an arrangement of densely packed passive cells around a current source
(such as in Fig.[10A]), the system will be equivalent to a series of RC circuits, each representing one “layer”
of cells. In this context, it may be interesting to relate the type of spatial arrangement with the type of
equivalent circuit(s) obtained, for example by considering diﬀerent cases such as cells or random diameters,
various shapes, or even by using 3-D morphological data from real brains obtained by serial reconstructions
from electron microscopy. This type of investigation constitutes a possible extension of the present work.
In this work we have considered a source being given by a single neuron. In reality, the source of LFP
activity is a system of many neurons with complicated phase relationships between their activities. An
extension of our model in this direction would be a most important step to take.

A second model prediction that should be testable experimentally concerns the predicted cut-oﬀ fre-
quency. This information can be related to experimentally recorded LFPs which could be analyzed using
Fourier analysis to yield information about the cut-oﬀ frequency. However, such an analysis should be done
by comparing diﬀerent network states, to make sure that the cutoﬀ frequency is not dependent on activity
but rather depends on structural parameters. If correctly done, this analysis should provide an estimate of
the Maxwell’s relaxation time for the surface of membranes, or equivalently the tangential conductivity of
membrane, for which there exists presently no experimental measurement. Work in this direction is under
way.

Finally, we would like to conclude by suggesting that these theoretical predictions in conjunction with
measurements of frequency dependent ﬁeld potentials may lead to new ways for detecting anomalies, for
example due to degenerative diseases like Alzheimer or brain tumors. If such diseases cause structural
changes in brain tissue, e.g. creation of vacuoles, this will manifest itself by changes of electric properties
like the attenuation of low or high-frequency components with distance. These changes should be visible
in measurements of EEG, ECoG or LFP signals from multielectrodes in the area of aﬀected brain tissue.
Detecting such changes supposes a prior understanding of the spectral ﬁltering properties of these electric
signals, which is one of the main motivation of the present work.

VI. APPENDIX

Here we discuss the Heaviside method as well as the Fourier transformation for the purpose to determine
the asymptotic behavior of the solution of a class of diﬀerential equations. We want to determine the

The Heaviside function H(t) or θ-function θ(t) is deﬁned as

Let us start out by considering the following diﬀerential equation,

This function hops between zero and 1 with a frequency ω thus giving a oscillating step function. A function
of this kind (however shifted and stretched) is shown in Fig.[2A]. Now let us consider Eq.[55] with solution
given by Eq.[56]. The inhomogeneous term of the diﬀerential equation (r.h.s.) is constant for positive time.
The solution increases with time to approach an asymptotic value. Next consider Eq.[58] with solution
given by Eq.[60]. The inhomogeneous term of the diﬀerential equation (r.h.s.) is zero for positive time.
The solution decreases with time to approach the asymptotic value zero. Thus, when we consider now the
diﬀerential equation

we see that its inhomogeneous term is an oscillating step function. That means its inhomogeneous term
alternates between the inhomogeneous term of Eq.[55] and that of Eq.[58]. Consequently, the solution of
Eq.[62] alternates between that given by Eq.[56] and that by Eq.[60], i.e. its increases and then decreases
exponentially. Such a solution is shown in Fig.[2B].
Now let us consider the diﬀerential equation [53]. We want to compute its asymptotic behavior for large
positive time. We consider the homogeneous equation

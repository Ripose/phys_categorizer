Abstract. – We investigate numerically and on the scaling level the adsorption of a charged
colloid on an oppositely charged ﬂexible membrane. We show that the long ranged character
of the electrostatic interaction leads to a wrapping reentrance of the complex as the salt con-
centration is varied. The membrane wrapping depends on the size of the colloid and on the
salt concentration and only for intermediate salt concentration and colloid sizes we ﬁnd full
wrapping. From the scaling model we derive simple relations for the phase boundaries between
the diﬀerent states of the complex, which agree well with the numerical minimization of the
free energy.

When a charged spherical particle adsorbs on an oppositely charged ﬂexible membrane,
the membrane deforms and wraps around the particle. This mechanism plays an important
role in many physical and biological processes. Introduction of genes into cells via cationic
lipid-DNA complexes has been one important theme in biological research over the last few
decades. Recent investigations show that endocytosis of lipid-DNA-complexes is triggered
by electrostatic interactions with the cell membrane [1, 2, 3]. Moreover, some viruses rely on
internalization via endocytic uptake, where non-speciﬁc electrostatic interactions (and not a
particular structural motif) seem to play a crucial role [4, 5, 6, 7]. In all cases the transfection
eﬃciency depends on the size of the interacting particle [8,9], on the charge densities of the cell
and particle surfaces and on the salt concentration [2, 3, 4, 8, 10]. But also in many physical
experiments wrapping of particles by membranes is important [11, 12, 13]. Motivated by
these examples, we investigate in this paper the role of the electrostatic interaction between a
charged colloidal particle and an oppositely charged membrane in the adsorption and wrapping
process. The adsorption of a neutral spherical particle on a neutral ﬂuid membrane due to a
local adhesion potential has been studied theoretically already in [14], discussing the role of
the elastic parameters of the membrane in the wrapping process. Furthermore, the wrapping
of a colloid by a membrane is related to the budding of vesicles, which was subject to many

shown to play a crucial role. We ﬁnd that it is the long-ranged character of the electrostatic

case of low salt concentration or small colloids, the electrostatic interaction is barely screened
and due to membrane-membrane repulsion the membrane only slightly wraps around the
colloid. By increasing the salt concentration or the size of the colloid the screening of the
membrane-membrane repulsion leads to a wrapping of the colloid by the membrane. Increasing
the salt concentration or the size further, the electrostatic attraction between the colloid
and the membrane becomes too weak compared with the mechanical bending energy of the
membrane and again the membrane is only slightly wrapped. Therefore, the membrane wraps
the colloid optimally only for intermediate salt concentrations or colloid sizes. This is similar to
the complexation behavior of a polyelectrolyte and an oppositely charged sphere as discussed
in [17].

In our model, the membrane is described as a two dimensional elastic surface with homoge-
neous charge density σ, bending rigidity K0 and surface tension γ; the colloid is approximated
by a homogeneously charged sphere with radius R and charge Z. We describe the electro-
static interactions by Debye-H¨uckel (DH) potentials. The simplest free energy to describe the
system considered here, in units of kBT , is given by the sum of the following three parts [18]:

The vector X(ρ) describes the position of the membrane in space, where ρ = (ρ1, ρ2) are

bending energy (ﬁrst term) and the surface tension (second term). The repulsive electrostatic
interaction between the membrane segments is given by Frep and the electrostatic membrane-
colloid attraction is denoted by Fattr . The inverse Debye-H¨uckel screening length is given
by κ := √8πℓBc (c is the salt concentration), while the Bjerrum length ℓB := e2/4πε0εkBT
measures the distance at which two elementary charges interact with thermal energy kBT .
The membrane is ﬁxed at a circular frame of radius L connected to an area reservoir. In this
way the projected area of the membrane remains constant as the membrane wraps around
the colloid. In particular, this means that also the total charge of the system is not preserved,

which generates an electrostatic tension γel =
γeﬀ = γ +γel appearing in eq.(1) consists of the sum of the bare tension γ and the electrostatic
tension γel .

We analyze the free energy of the system, F = Fmech + Frep + Fattr , using two approaches.
First, we minimize the free energy numerically and, second, we investigate the free energy in
a simpliﬁed geometry on a scaling level. We distinguish three diﬀerent states of the complex,
which can be deﬁned as the membrane wraps around the colloid using the wrapping height
h deﬁned by the point at which the membrane detaches from the colloid (see ﬁg.1(c)):
i)
the point contact state: the membrane touches the sphere only in one point (h = 0), ii) the
touching state: membrane touches the colloid over a ﬁnite area, but less then half of the
colloid (R > h > 0) iii) the wrapped state: the membrane covers more then half of the colloid
surface (2R
R). Deﬁning the wrapping threshold at h = R and not at h = 2R (as
was done e.g. in [14]) is necessary in order to avoid the singularity at h = 2R caused by the
touching of charged surfaces in the numerical minimization. In what follows, we rescale the

otherwise. We choose the parameter g in such a way that the equilibrium membrane-sphere
separation is 0.999R. Beside the constraint of constant projected area we impose, if not stated
otherwise, the boundary condition that the membrane becomes planar at the edge. Fig.1(a)
shows for three diﬀerent colloid charges ˜Z the numerically obtained membrane shapes for
κR = 50 (high salt/large colloid limit) and vanishing surface tension ˜γ. For ˜Z = 7.82 the
membrane is in the touching state. By elevating ˜Z the membrane bends further around the
colloid and is for ˜Z = 8.38 right at the transition point between the touching and the wrapped
state, while for ˜Z = 8.54 the membrane is in the wrapped state. Due to the strong screening
of the electrostatic interaction the dominating energy contribution stems from the mechanical
bending energy and the membrane wraps into a catenoid-like shape (surface of revolution
of the curve x(s)
1 [19]), reducing in this way its elastic bending
energy. In ﬁg.1(b) we show the unwrapping of the membrane by increasing the surface tension
for κR = 10 and ˜σ = 1.0 (the numbers denote ˜γ). For zero surface tension the membrane
is in the wrapped state.

salt concentration/small colloids), the electrostatic interactions are dominant and thus govern
the shape of the membrane. In this case the long-ranged electrostatic attraction pulls the
membrane closer to the colloid, producing the volcano-like shape presented in ﬁg.1(d) for
κR = 0.1 and ˜σ = 1.0 (the numbers denote ˜Z). Comparison of the wrapped states in ﬁg.1(a)
and ﬁg.1(d) demonstrates clearly the diﬀerent wrapping structure of the membrane for small
and large κR, respectively. The shapes in ﬁg.1(c) are obtained without imposing a boundary
condition for the membrane at the edge in order to compare the wrapping shapes (symbols)
of the membrane for diﬀerent κR and ˜Z with a catenoid (solid line) touching the colloid at
h = R. The rescaled colloid charge ˜Z was adjusted in such a way that the wrapping height of
the membrane is in all cases the same (h = R). It can be clearly seen that the deviation from
the catenoidal-shape becomes pronounced as κR decreases, since the range of the electrostatic
interaction increases. The calculation of membrane shapes for diﬀerent parameters allows us
to measure the complexation diagrams presented in ﬁg.2. Before we discuss these diagrams we
calculate the phase boundaries between the diﬀerent states of the complex using a simpliﬁed
scaling model.

In the geometry shown in ﬁg.1(e) the calculation of the free energy is analytically tractable,
yielding the free energy in form of a Landau function with the rescaled wrapping height
˜h := h/R playing the role of the order parameter, from which we can extract simple scaling
relations for the phase boundaries. The mechanical energy and the electrostatic membrane-
colloid attraction read:

Using the equations (4)-(7) we can analyze the transitions between the diﬀerent membrane
states in the following way. The touching transition occurs when the coeﬃcient in front of ˜h

behavior of the complex can also be seen in ﬁg.3(a), where we plot the wrapping height ˜h,
which minimizes the scaling free energy, as a function of κR. The solid line results from the
scaling free energy, eq.(4)-(7) with the constraint ˜h
2 and the solid circles show the results
obtained from the full model. The physical mechanism for this wrapping/unwrapping is the
following. If κR is small, the electrostatic interaction is long ranged and the free membrane
area is strongly self repelling. As the membrane bends around the colloid, charged membrane
area is pulled closer together and the resulting energy cost has to be paid for by increasing
the membrane-colloid attraction. In particular, this means that for zero salt concentration
(κR = 0), i.e.
in the case of pure Coulomb interaction, the membrane only slightly bends
around the colloid, no matter how large ˜Z is. On the other hand, if κR is large the electrostatic
membrane-colloid attraction is screened and in order to overcome the bending energy of the
membrane the rescaled colloid charge has to be increased again.

depending on κR. For small as well as for large κR the membrane wraps the colloid only
for large colloid charges. From the scaling model we derive simple relations for the phase
boundaries of the complex, which agree well with our results from the more complex full
model. The electrostatic repulsion between the membrane segments plays a crucial role in
the adsorption process of charged colloid on an oppositely charged membrane. But also for
the adhesion of neutral colloids at charged membranes in the case of a non-electrostatic local
adhesion energy the membrane self repulsion is important. Since most bio-membranes are
negatively charged the electrostatic mechanism studied in this paper plays certainly a role in
many biological systems.

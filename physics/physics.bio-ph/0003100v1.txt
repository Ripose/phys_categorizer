We introduce the concept of self-tuned criticality as
a general mechanism for signal detection in sensory
systems. In the case of hearing, we argue that active
ampliﬁcation of faint sounds is provided by a dynam-
ical system which is maintained at the threshold of
an oscillatory instability. This concept can account
for the exquisite sensitivity of the auditory system
and its wide dynamic range, as well as its capacity to
respond selectively to diﬀerent frequencies. A spe-
ciﬁc model of sound detection by the hair cells of the
inner ear is discussed. We show that a collection of
motor proteins within a hair bundle can generate os-
cillations at a frequency which depends on the elastic
properties of the bundle. Simple variation of bun-
dle geometry gives rise to hair cells with character-
istic frequencies which span the range of audibility.
Tension-gated transduction channels, which primar-
ily serve to detect the motion of a hair bundle, also
tune each cell by admitting ions which regulate the
motor protein activity. By controlling the bundle’s
propensity to oscillate, this feedback automatically
maintains the system in the operating regime where
it is most sensitive to sinusoidal stimuli. The model
explains how hair cells can detect sounds which carry
less energy than the background noise.

Detecting the sounds of the outside world imposes
stringent demands on the design of the inner ear, where
the transduction of acoustic stimuli to electrical signals
takes place [1]. The hair cells within the cochlea, which
act as mechanosensors, must each be responsive to a
particular frequency component of the auditory input.
Moreover, these sensors need the utmost sensitivity, since
the weakest audible sounds impart an energy, per cycle of
oscillation, which is no greater than that of thermal noise
[2]. At the same time, they must operate over a wide
range of volumes, responding and adapting to intensities
which vary by many orders of magnitude. Clearly, some
form of non-linear ampliﬁcation is necessary in sound de-
tection. The familiar resonant gain of a passive elastic
system is far from suﬃcient for the required demands, be-
cause of the heavy viscous damping at microscopic scales
[3]. Instead, the cochlea has developed active ampliﬁca-
tory processes, whose precise nature remains to be dis-
covered.

There is strong evidence that the cochlea contains
force-generating dynamical systems which are capable of

executing oscillations of a characteristic frequency [4–10].
In general, such a system exhibits a Hopf bifurcation [11]:
as the value of a control parameter is varied, the behavior
abruptly changes from a quiescent state to self-sustained
oscillations. When the system is in the immediate vicin-
ity of the bifurcation, it can act as a nonlinear ampliﬁer
for sinusoidal stimuli close to the characteristic frequency.
That such a phenomenon might occur in hearing was ﬁrst
proposed by Gold [3], more than 50 years ago. The idea
was recently revived by Choe, Magnasco and Hudspeth
[12], in the context of a speciﬁc model of the hair cell. No
general analysis of the ampliﬁcation aﬀorded by a Hopf
bifurcation has been provided, however, and no theory
has been advanced to explain how proximity to the bi-
furcation point might be ensured.

In this paper, we provide both a generic framework
which describes the known features of acoustic detec-
tion, and a detailed discussion of the speciﬁc elements
which could be involved in this detection. We ﬁrst derive
the general resonance and ampliﬁcation behavior of a dy-
namical system operating close to a Hopf bifurcation and
emphasize that such a system is well-suited to the ear’s
needs. In order for active ampliﬁcation to work reliably,
tuning to the bifurcation point is crucial. We introduce
the concept of a self-tuned Hopf bifurcation which per-
mits the favorable ampliﬁcatory properties of a dynami-
cal instability to be obtained in a robust way. Self-tuning
maintains the system in the proximity of the critical point
and is achieved by an appropriate feedback mechanism
which couples the output signal to the control parameter
that triggers the bifurcation. The concept can explain
several important features of the auditory sensor such as
the frequency selectivity, high sensitivity and the ability
to respond to a wide range of amplitudes.
It can also
explain the intrinsic nonlinear nature of sound detection
[13,14] and the occurrence of spontaneous sound emission
by the inner ear [9,10]. Furthermore, self-tuned criticality
provides a framework for understanding the role of noise
in the detection mechanism. The ampliﬁcatory process,
which involves a limited number of active elements, intro-
duces stochastic ﬂuctuations, which adds to those caused
by Brownian motion. We show that the response to weak
stimuli can take advantage of this background activity.

The proposed existence of a self-tuned Hopf bifurcation
raises questions about the speciﬁc mechanisms involved:
What is the physical basis of the dynamical system?

1

How is the self-tuning realized? It might be expected
that diﬀerent organisms have evolved diﬀerent apparatus
to implement the same general strategy. In this paper,
we restrict our speciﬁc discussion to the more primitive
cochleae of non-mammalian vertebrates. We propose a
model of the hair cell of the inner ear which accords with
data from a wide variety of physiological experiments.
The model incorporates a physical mechanism which al-
lows motor proteins to generate spontaneous oscillations
[15]. We ﬁnd that molecular motors such as dyneins in
the kinocilium or myosins in the stereocilia are natural
candidates for the force generators involved in the ampli-
ﬁcation of hair-bundle motion. Tension-gated transduc-
tion channels in the stereocilia serve primarily to detect
this motion, but also have a second function: by admit-
ting ions which regulate the motor protein activity, they
provide the self-tuning mechanism.

I. GENERIC ASPECTS

Ampliﬁcation and frequency ﬁltering of a Hopf
bifurcation. We discuss the behavior of a dynamical
system which is controlled by a parameter C. Above a
critical value, C > Cc, the system is stable; for C < Cc it
oscillates spontaneously. At the critical point (or Hopf bi-
furcation) C = Cc the system shows remarkable response
and ampliﬁcation properties which do not depend on the
physical mechanism at the basis of the bifurcation. These
generic properties can be described as follows. Since
we are interested in the response to a periodic stimu-
lus with frequency ν = ω/2π, we express the hair-bundle

−n.

deﬂection x(t) by a Fourier series x(t) = P xneinωt with

complex amplitudes xn = x∗
In the vicinity of the
bifurcation, the mode n = ±1 is dominant and the re-
sponse to an externally-applied sinusoidal stimulus force
f (t) = f1eiωt + f−1e−iωt can be expressed in terms of
a systematic expansion in x1. Symmetry arguments (see
Appendix A) imply that the ﬁrst nonlinear term is cubic:

f1 = A x1 + B |x1|2x1 + ...

(1)

where A(ω, C) and B(ω, C) are two complex functions.
The bifurcation point is characterized by the fact that A
vanishes for the critical frequency, A(ωc, Cc) = 0. For
C < Cc and no external force, the system oscillates with
|x1|2 ≃ ∆2 (Cc − C)/Cc, where ∆ is a characteristic
amplitude. For C = Cc the response to a stimulus at the
critical frequency has amplitude

|x1| ≃ |B|−1/3|f1|1/3

.

(2)

This represents an ampliﬁed response at the critical fre-
quency with a gain

r =

|x1|
|f1|

∼ |f1|−2/3

(3)

2

that becomes arbitrarily large for small forces.

If the stimulus frequency diﬀers from the critical fre-
quency, the linear term in Eq. (1) is non-zero and can be
expressed to ﬁrst order as A(ω, Cc) ≃ A1 (ω − ωc). The
dramatic ampliﬁcation of weak signals, implied by Eq.
(3), is maintained as long as this term does not exceed
the cubic term in Eq. (1).
If the frequency mismatch
increases such that |ω − ωc| ≫ |f1|2/3|B|1/3/|A1|, the re-
sponse becomes linear

|x1| ≃

|f1|

|(ω − ωc)A1|

(4)

i.e. the gain is independent of the strength of the stimu-
lus.

FIG. 1. Response to external forces near a Hopf bifurca-
tion (a) Amplitude |x1| as a function of force |f1| at various
driving frequencies ν (✸ 2 kHz, × 5 kHz, ✷ 10 kHz, + 13
kHz). (b) Gain r as a function of frequency ν for diﬀerent
amplitudes |f1| (✸ 0.01 pN, △ 0.05 pN, + 0.1 pN, × 0.5 pN,
✷ 1 pN). While the form of these curves is generic, the numer-
ical values of force, amplitude and frequency depend on the
physical nature of the dynamical system. The values given
here correspond to the speciﬁc model model of a hair cell dis-
cussed in the text, with parameters chosen to give a critical
frequency of approximately 10 kHz.

Thus the Hopf resonance acts as a sharply tuned high-
gain ampliﬁer for weak stimuli, and as a low-gain ﬁlter
for strong stimuli. This generic behavior is illustrated
in Fig. 1 with data obtained by numerical simulation.
Laser interferometry measurements of the motion of the
basilar membrane, when the live cochlea is stimulated
by pure tones, display strikingly similar features [16,17].

In particular, the peak response as a function of force
amplitude has been demonstrated to obey a power law
|x1| ∼ |f1|0.4±0.2 [17]. This strongly suggests that the
membrane is being driven by a dynamical system which
is poised at a Hopf bifurcation.

Self-tuned critical oscillations. How does the sys-
tem come to be so precisely balanced at the critical
point?1 The control parameter must be tuned to C ≃ Cc,
otherwise the nonlinear ampliﬁcation is lost. Moreover,
the value of Cc diﬀers for hair cells with diﬀerent char-
acteristic frequency. We propose a feedback mechanism
which allows the dynamical system to operate automat-
ically close to the bifurcation point, whatever its char-
acteristic frequency. Without loss of generality, we as-
sume that the control parameter decreases as long as the
system does not oscillate. After some time, critical con-
ditions are reached and spontaneous oscillations ensue.
The onset of oscillations triggers an increase of the con-
trol parameter which tends to restore stability. Hence
the system converges to an operating point close to the
bifurcation point. To illustrate this general idea, we con-
sider the following simple feedback which changes C in
response to deﬂections x:

1
C

∂C
∂t

=

1

τ (cid:18) x2

δ2 − 1(cid:19)

(5)

where δ is a typical amplitude. If no external force is ap-
plied, this feedback, after a relaxation time τ , tunes the
control parameter to a value Cδ for which spontaneous
oscillations with |x1| ≃ δ occur. If δ is small compared to
the characteristic amplitude ∆, this is on the oscillating
side close to the bifurcation, |Cδ −Cc|/Cc ≃ (δ/∆)2. Two
modes of signal detection are possible: (i) For transient
stimuli short compared to τ the system operates at Cδ.
The amplitude |x1| shows the characteristic nonlinear re-
sponse discussed above. (ii) For stimuli sustained over
longer times, self-tuning maintains |x1| ≃ δ constant for
diﬀerent stimulus amplitudes. This eﬀect of the feedback
represents a perfect adaptation mechanism. However, in
the presence of noise, phase-locking of the response (to
be discussed later) occurs as soon as an external stimulus
is applied, and this can be detected.

II. MODEL

Mechanosensitivity and self-tuning mechanism
provided by transduction channels. We demon-
strate the general principles introduced above by devising
a speciﬁc model for the ampliﬁcation of acoustic stim-
uli by hair bundles in non-mammalian vertebrates. A

1Self-tuning to a coexistence point has been discussed pre-
viously in certain dynamic ﬁrst-order transitions [18].

schematic representation of a hair bundle is shown in Fig.
2. It consists of several stereocilia and a single kinocil-
ium [19,20]. Transduction of hair bundle deﬂection to
a chemical signal occurs via channels located near the
tip of each stereocilium. Tip links which connect neigh-
boring stereocilia are believed to be the gating springs of
the transduction channels. If the hair bundle is deﬂected,
tension in the tip links triggers the opening of the chan-
nels. The subsequent inﬂux of ions (principally K+, but
also Ca2+) causes a corresponding change of the mem-
brane potential of the hair cell which, in turn, generates
a nervous signal.

The mechanosensor can be used for self-tuning, as well
as signal detection. Many physiological processes are reg-
ulated by ionic concentrations, so it is natural to identify
the Ca2+ concentration with the control parameter C.
We assume that C decreases if the transduction chan-
nels are closed, owing to the action of pumps in the cell
membrane. When the hair bundle is deﬂected by x, the
transduction channels open with probability Po(x). We
therefore characterize the mechanosensor by the equation

∂C
∂t

= −

C
τ

+ JoPo(x)

(6)

where Jo is the Ca2+ ﬂux through open transduction
channels. Note that this equation provides self-tuning.
In this case it replaces the more simple but less realistic
Eq. (5). For our numerical examples, we use a two-state
model for the channels with

Po(x) =

1

1 + Ae−x/δ

(7)

where (1 + A)−1 ≪ 1 is the probability that a chan-
nel is open when the hair cell is quiescent and δ is the
characteristic amplitude of motion to which the system
is sensitive. For a suﬃciently long relaxation time τ , the
slow variation C0 of C ≃ C0(t) + C1eiωt can be separated
from the small-amplitude oscillations, giving

∂tC0 ≃ −

C0
τ

+ Jo ˜Po(|x1|2)

(8)

0

where ˜Po = R 1/ν

dt Po(x1eiωt + x−1e−iωt) is the averaged
probability of channel opening in the presence of oscilla-
tions, which increases monotonically with their ampli-
tude x1. For physically relevant parameter values, the
system reaches a steady state close to the bifurcation
point, independent of the initial value of C.

Oscillations generated by molecular motors. We
still have to specify the nature and location of the oscil-
lator within the hair bundle. It has been suggested that
the transduction channels might be the source of the in-
stability [7,12]; or, that myosin motors in the stereocilia
might generate the force necessary to move the bundle
[21,22]. We propose a third possibility: the kinocilium
could vibrate using its internal dynein motors. Recently,

a simple physical mechanism has been proposed which al-
lows motor proteins operating in collections to generate
spontaneous oscillations by traversing a Hopf bifurcation
[15,23]. Typically, motors move along cytoskeletal ﬁla-
ments and elastic elements oppose this motion. In this
case, two possibilities exist: The system either reaches
a stable balance between opposing forces, or it oscillates
around the balanced state. Three time scales characterize
this behavior: The relaxation time λ/K of passive relax-
ation, where λ is the total friction and K is the elastic
modulus; and the times ω−1
2 , where ω1 is the
kinetic rate at which a motor detaches from a ﬁlament,
and ω2 is the attachment rate. An explicit solution of
a simple model is derived in Appendix B. We ﬁnd that
for an appropriate value of a control parameter C, which
is related to the ratio ω1/ω2, a Hopf bifurcation occurs
with critical frequency

and ω−1

ωc ≃ (cid:18) Kα

λ (cid:19)1/2

(9)

which is the geometric mean of the passive relaxation rate
K/λ and the typical ATP hydrolysis rate α = ω1 + ω2.
The above identiﬁcation of C with the Ca2+ concentra-
tion is consistent with the fact that Ca2+ regulates motor
protein activity [24]. The system oscillates if the elastic
modulus does not exceed a maximal value Kmax ≃ k0N ,
where k0 is the crossbridge elasticity of a motor and N
is the total number of motors. The maximal frequency,
obtained when K = Kmax, can be signiﬁcantly higher
than the ATP hydrolysis rate α.

FIG. 2. A hair bundle consists of a single kinocilium and
tens to hundreds of stereocilia. The kinocilium contains
dynein motors (red). The stereocilia contain transduction
channels (blue) which are gated by the tension in the tip links
(cyan); the steady-state tension is maintained constant by
adaptation motors (magenta). In our model, the kinocilium
is the active part of the mechanoreceptor and the stereocilia
act as the detection apparatus. Feedback control of the active
ampliﬁcatory process involves the inﬂux of Ca2+ ions through
the transduction channels; the ions diﬀuse into the kinocilium
and regulate the generation of force by the motor proteins.

Characteristic frequency of a vibrating kinocil-
ium. The kinocilium is a true cilium containing a cylin-
drical arrangement of microtubule doublets and dynein
motors. Since cilia have the well-established tendency
to beat and vibrate with frequencies from tens of Hz
up to at least 1 kHz [25,26], the kinocilium is a natu-
ral candidate to be responsible for the Hopf bifurcation.
A simple two-dimensional model can be used to discuss
the main physical properties of a vibrating cilium near a
Hopf bifurcation [27]. In this model, motors induce the
bending of a pair of elastic ﬁlaments separated by a dis-
tance a (corresponding to the distance between neighbor-
ing microtubule doublets in the axoneme). An isolated
kinocilium of length L and bending rigidity κ, ﬁxed at
the basal end but free at its tip, will vibrate in a wave-like
mode with wavelength Λ ≃ 4L. A typical displacement
z of the motors along the ﬁlaments leads to bending of
the ﬁlament pair and a deﬂection of the tip by a dis-
tance x ≃ zL/a. The elastic bending energy is of order
(κ/L3)x2 ≃ (κ/a2L)z2. Therefore, the total elastic mod-
ulus experienced by the motors is given by

K ≃

κ
La2

.

(10)

The viscous energy dissipation per unit time due to
motion of the kinocilium is of order ηL(∂tx)2 ≃
(ηL3/a2)(∂tz)2. Therefore, the total friction experienced
by the motors can be written as

λ ≃

ηL3
a2 + λ0ρL ,

(11)

where λ0 describes the dissipation within the kinocilium
per motor and ρ = N/L denotes the number of dynein
motors per unit length along the axoneme.
If internal
friction can be neglected, i.e. if L ≫ L0 = (λ0a2ρ/η)1/2,
the frequency of a vibrating cilium at the bifurcation
point is given by

ωc ≃ (cid:18) κα

η (cid:19)1/2 1

L2

.

(12)

Using typical values λ0 ≃ 10−9 kg/s, a ≃ 20 nm, ρ ≃
5 108 m−1 and η ≃ 10−3 kg/ms, we ﬁnd L0 ≃ 200 nm,
shorter than typical kinocilia. Using α ≃ 103 s−1, k0 ≃
10−3 N/m and κ ≃ 4 10−22 Nm2 (the bending rigidity
of 20 microtubules), the frequency range between 100 Hz
and 10 kHz can naturally be spanned by changing the
length of the kinocilium between 1 µm and 10 µm.

The above argument neglects the contribution of the
stereocilia to elasticity and motion. The elastic response
of stereocilia to hair bundle deﬂections has been mea-
sured [6,28]. It can be well described by an angular spring
at the base of each stereocilium which contributes an
elastic energy per stereocilium of the order of ks(x/L)2,
where ks is an angular elastic modulus. The kinocilium

length L in a hair bundle is approximately inversely pro-
portional to the number Ns of stereocilia [19], and we
write Ns ≃ ls/L, where ls ≃ 10−4 m is the total length of
stereocilia. With this assumption, we ﬁnd an additional
elastic modulus

Ks ≃

lsks
La2

(13)

contributed by the stereocilia to K. The contribution of
stereocilia to the friction coeﬃcient λ can be estimated
as

λs ≃ ηlsL2/a2

.

(14)

The measured value of ks [28] indicates that Ks domi-
nates the contribution to K given by Eq. (10). Similarly,
since ls > L, λs should dominate friction. In this case,
we expect

ωc ≃ (cid:18) ksα

ηL3(cid:19)1/2

(15)

and the range of frequencies is somewhat reduced.

If the stiﬀness of the ensemble of stereocilia greatly
exceeds that of the kinocilium, a new situation arises.
Since the kinocilium is attached to the stereocilia at its
tip [20], movement of the tip is strongly reduced and the
kinocilium preferentially vibrates in a mode with wave-
length Λ ≃ 2L for which the relation given by Eq. (12)
is again valid.

Adaptation motors. Finally, we note that in order
to obtain a robust self-tuning, the feedback mechanism
must be sensitive only to the oscillation amplitude x1
and not to a stationary displacement x0; we assumed in
Eq. (8) that ˜Po is independent of x0. The transduction
mechanism of stereocilia and their tension-gated chan-
nels does indeed have this property: It is well known
that an ATP-dependent adaptation mechanism [29] ex-
ists which removes the dependence of the channel cur-
rent on a constant displacement x0. It is widely believed
that this adaptation involves the motion of myosin mo-
tors, which maintains constant the steady-state tension
in the tip links that control the transduction channels
[30]. Therefore, the stereociliar transduction mechanism
has precisely the required properties to be used as a feed-
back signal for self-tuning the bifurcation.

III. SIMULATION

The above analysis does not include the eﬀects of noise.
Brownian motion is one source of ﬂuctuations in the
movement of the hair bundle [31]. Another source of
noise is caused by stochastic ﬂuctuations in motor pro-
tein force as dynein molecules bind to, and detach from
the microtubules in the kinocilium. In order to investi-
gate the consequences of this randomness, we performed

a Monte Carlo simulation of the two-state model de-
scribed in [15], using a realistic number of motor pro-
teins. The motors, when attached, experienced a po-
tential of amplitude U and period l (the corresponding
crossbridge elasticity is k0 = U/l2). The attachment rate
was constant and independent of position, ω2 = α. De-
tachment was localized to a region of width 0.1 l, centred
on the potential minimum and the detachment rate ω1
was regulated by the Ca2+ concentration C. We chose
ω1/ω2 = (Cq/C)3, where Cq is the steady-state Ca2+
concentration in a quiescent hair cell; the precise func-
tional dependence is unimportant as long as ω1/ω2 de-
creases monotonically with increasing C in a fairly sen-
sitive way. We simulated systems with N = 1000-4000
motors, representing hair cells with diﬀerent kinocilium
length and stereociliary number.

FIG. 3. Self-tuning of a hair bundle. If the Ca2+ concen-
tration C within the cell is artiﬁcially high, the hair bundle
is initially quiescent; but as Ca2+ ions are pumped from the
cell, it gradually begins to oscillate with small amplitude. If C
is suddenly artiﬁcially lowered, the hair bundle becomes un-
stable and executes high-amplitude spontaneous oscillations.
Since these movements open the transduction channels, the
inﬂux J of Ca2+ ions increases; the consequent change in C
regulates the motors and diminishes the amplitude of the os-
cillation until it almost disappears. In the steady state, the
bundle executes self-tuned critical oscillations (STCO). For
this simulation, we assumed that the probability of transduc-
tion channels opening was Po(z) = (1 + 10e−20z/l)−1, where
z is the motor displacement, and that the time constant for
equilibration of the Ca2+ concentration was τ = 1000/α.

Self-tuning and the characteristic frequency of
spontaneous oscillations. The self-tuning of a hair cell
to the vicinity of the bifurcation, where small-amplitude
spontaneous oscillations occur, is demonstrated in Fig.
3. When a change of the internal Ca2+ concentration
is imposed, the system is transiently perturbed; but af-
ter an interval of time of order τ , it returns to the same
steady state. Hair cells with diﬀerent numbers of motors
acquire diﬀerent internal concentrations of Ca2+, in or-
der to adjust the motor detachment rate in such a way

5

that the system approaches the critical point. The spon-
taneous oscillations of three diﬀerent hair bundles are
shown in Fig. 4. Note that the characteristic frequency
is approximately proportional to the inverse-square of the
number of motors, as expected from Eq. (12), and that
it can exceed the typical ATP cycle rate α when the total
number of motors is small (short kinocilium). All three
hair cells execute spontaneous oscillations with a similar
amplitude, as expected from our arguments above. How-
ever, the noise introduces a signiﬁcant new eﬀect: The
oscillations are irregular. The incoherence of the phase
of the oscillation is evident in the Fourier transform of
the displacement, which exhibits a broad peak centred
on the characteristic frequency.

FIG. 4. Self-tuned critical oscillations of systems compris-
ing N = 1000, 2000 and 4000 motors. In each case, the os-
cillation has small amplitude z ≃ 0.1 l and is irregular, as
can be seen from the broadness of the Fourier spectrum. For
these simulations we chose parameters k0/λα = 4 107N −3
and K/λα = 4 1013N −4, which correspond with the scaling
dependence of the spring constant and friction coeﬃcient on
kinocilium length in Eqs. (10-11), and also with the order of
magnitude estimates of the physical parameters, given in the
text.

Dynamic response to a tone at the characteris-
tic frequency. The response of a self-tuned hair bun-
dle to a sinusoidal force with a frequency approximately
equal to the bundle’s characteristic frequency is illus-
trated in Fig. 5. For weak stimuli,the amplitude of the
oscillation does not increase with the amplitude |f1| of
the applied force; this is because the small response to
the stimulus is masked by the noisy, spontaneous motion.
Instead, the phase of the hair-bundle oscillation becomes
more regular; as it does so, a peak emerges from the
Fourier spectrum at the driving frequency. The height of
the peak grows approximately as |f1|1/3 for intermediate
values of |f1|, and approximately linearly for very weak
stimuli, and also for very strong stimuli (for which the

6

response is essentially passive). Thus the Fourier compo-
nent of the hair-bundle displacement at the driving fre-
quency responds to the stimulus in the generic manner
discussed above.

nusoidal force at frequency ν = 0.3α, close to the hair bundle’s
characteristic frequency. Curves are marked by the dimen-
sionless amplitude of the force, |f1|/fmot, where fmot = U/l
is the force produced by a motor molecule. Note that a force
equal to that of a single motor is suﬃcient to elicit a response
in the Fourier spectrum. Curves shaded red are the responses
of an equivalent, passive hair bundle (i.e. a bundle with iden-
tical mechanical properties but no force generators).

Phase-locking of the nervous signal. The ﬂow of
ions through the transduction channels depolarizes the
cell membrane which, in turn, opens voltage-gated chan-
nels at the base of the hair cell and generates a synaptic
current [1]. This sequence of events happens fast enough
for variations at the synapse faithfully to reﬂect the hair-
bundle motion at frequencies below 1 kHz. Information
about the auditory stimulus is subsequently passed along
the auditory nerve in the form of a spike train. Simpli-
fying this transduction process, we assume that a spike
is elicited whenever the transduction channel current J
passes a threshold value of 0.5Jo. The resulting nervous
response is shown in Fig. 6. In the absence of a stimu-
lus, the self-tuned critical oscillations of the bundle cause
the nerve to ﬁre stochastically, at a low rate. When
a weak sinusoidal stimulus is applied at the character-
istic frequency, the ﬁring rate does not increase above
the spontaneous rate, but the spike train becomes de-
tectably phase-locked to the stimulus. The degree of
phase-locking increases rapidly as the amplitude of the
stimulus increases, reﬂecting the growing regularity of
the hair-bundle motion. It is only when the neural re-
sponse is almost completely phase-locked that the ﬁring
rate begins to rise. Eventually, for strong stimuli, the
spike rate saturates at the stimulus frequency. This be-

havior is strikingly similar to that which is observed ex-
perimentally.
In particular, it is well known that the
threshold for phase-locking in the auditory nerve ﬁber
is 10-20 dB lower than the threshold at which the ﬁring
rate begins to rise [32,33].

bundle can be appreciated by comparing the neural response
to a stimulus with frequency close to the characteristic fre-
quency, ν = 0.3α (•), with the response to other frequencies,
ν = 0.15α (▽) and ν = 0.6α (△).

IV. DISCUSSION

The self-tuned critical oscillator which we have intro-
duced as a system for signal detection has characteris-
tic ampliﬁcation properties which are generic and do not
depend on the choice of a speciﬁc model. The oscilla-
tion frequency, however, depends on the physical mech-
anism involved.
In our model of non-mammalian hair
cells, the frequency is determined by the geometry of the
hair bundle. A simple morphological gradient along the
basilar membrane would endow the ear with the abil-
ity to analyze a wide range of frequencies. Experimen-
tally, it is well established that the height of hair bun-
dles progressively increases along the cochlea, and that
concurrently the characteristic frequency of the hair cells
declines [19,34]. Our proposition that the kinocilium is
likely to play an active role in non-mammalian vertebrate
hair cells suggests experiments which study the motility
of the kinocilium and its potential for generating oscilla-
tions. If the kinocilium is the only source of oscillations,
its removal should suppress hair-bundle vibrations.
If

the self-tuning mechanism is removed instead (by cut-
ting the tip links, for example) our model predicts that
the kinocilium should exhibit stronger spontaneous oscil-
lations. Careful control of the extracellular ion concen-
trations, such as Ca2+ would be essential in such exper-
iments.

The simulations of our model reveal how a hair bundle
can achieve its remarkable sensitivity to weak stimuli. By
proﬁting from the periodicity of a sinusoidal input, and
measuring phase-locking rather than the amplitude of re-
sponse, the mechanosensor can detect forces considerably
weaker than those exerted by a single molecular motor (if
the bundle were a simple, passive structure, its response
to such forces would be smaller than its Brownian mo-
tion). An important implication of this detection mech-
anism is that even though the hair cell selects a certain
frequency, the signal must still be encoded by the interval
between spikes elicited in the auditory nerve. Paradoxi-
cally, the stochastic noise caused by the motor proteins
serves a useful purpose.
It ensures that the self-tuned
critical oscillations of the hair bundle are incoherent, so
that the pattern of spontaneous ﬁring in the nerve is ir-
regular. Against this background, the regular response
to a periodic stimulus can easily be detected.2

Another beneﬁcial feature of noise arises from the fact
that weak stimuli do not increase the amplitude of oscil-
lation above the spontaneous amplitude. Thus the Ca2+
concentration remains constant, the hair bundle stays in
the critical regime, and active ampliﬁcation can be sus-
tained indeﬁnitely. Stronger stimuli cause the system to
drift away from the critical point, so that the degree of
ampliﬁcation diminishes over time. It is well known that
both the perception of loudness [35] and the ﬁring rate
of the auditory nerve [36] decrease over a period of a few
seconds, when a stimulus of moderate intensity is main-
tained. This phenomenon, which is usually referred to
as ‘adaptation’, is consistent with our self-tuning mech-
anism. Following the sustained presentation of a loud
stimulus, the spontaneous ﬁring rate diminishes and the
threshold to weak stimuli is augmented [36]. Such ‘fa-
tigue’ is also accounted for by our self-tuning mechanism.
Since self-tuning positions the system slightly on the
oscillating side of the critical point, self-tuned criticality
provides a natural explanation for otoacoustic emissions
[9,10]. In its normal working state, the inner ear would
generate faint sounds with a broad range of frequencies.
If the feedback mechanism were to fail in certain cells,
the spontaneous oscillations could become large enough
for distinct tones to be emitted.

A self-tuned Hopf bifurcation is ideal for sound detec-
tion because it provides sharp frequency selectivity and a

situations such as those involving stochastic resonance [37].

nonlinear gain which compresses a wide range of stimulus
intensities into a narrow range of response. We therefore
believe that the concept applies to all vertebrate hear-
ing systems, and potentially to other mechanoreceptor
systems. Kinocilia are typically absent in mammalian
cochlea, and we suggest that their force-generating role
has been assumed by the outer hair cells. Self-tuning of
these motile cells might be realized by a mechanism sim-
ilar to that presented here, using transduction channels
in their hair bundles. It could, however, work very dif-
ferently; for example, it might involve feedback from the
inner hair cells, via the eﬀerent nervous system.

Tuning to the proximity of a critical point is likely to
be a general strategy adopted by sensory systems. Simple
molecular receptors [38], as well as the physiological sen-
sors of higher organisms, can enhance their response to
weak stimuli in this way. We propose that the physics of
self-tuned criticality is the ‘central science of transducer
physiology’ spoken of by Delbr¨uck [39].

APPENDIX A: GENERIC BEHAVIOR AT A

HOPF-BIFURCATION

1. Nonlinear relation between periodic stimulus and

displacements

We are interested in the response x(t) of a nonlinear
system to a periodic stimulus force f (t). If only one fre-
quency ν = ω/2π is present we use the Fourier expansions

f (t) =

x(t) =

∞

Xn=−∞

fneinωt

xneinωt

,

(A1)

(A2)

where the complex coeﬃcients xn and fn obey xn = x∗
−n
and fn = f ∗
−n. This representation implies that we focus
on the limit cycle solution and ignore all transient relax-
ation phenomena. We consider the class of systems for
which the force at a given time depends in a nonlinear
way on the history of the displacements x(t) alone; as
we will discuss in section D more complex cases do not

change the basic properties. In this situation, the rela-
tion between x and f can be expressed as a systematic
expansion of the force amplitudes fn in the amplitudes
xn:

fk = F (1)

where the expansion coeﬃcients F (n)
are symmet-
ric with respect to permutations of the indices k1..kn.
The limit cycle solutions are invariant with respect to
translations in time t → t + ∆t. Under these transfor-
mations the amplitudes change as xn → xneinω∆t and
fn → fneinω∆t. Inspection of Eq. (A3) shows that the
time translation symmetry allows only for those terms
F (n)
xk1 ..xkn for which k = k1 + ... + kn. For all
k,k1,..,kn
other cases F (n)
must vanish which signiﬁcantly re-
stricts the number of terms.

2. Hopf bifurcation

The nonlinear system exhibits spontaneous oscillations
and a Hopf-bifurcation if nontrivial solutions to Eq. (A3)
with xn 6= 0 exist in the case where all fk = 0, i.e. if no
stimulus force is applied. Without loss of generality, we
consider here an instability of the mode x1. In this case,
the dominant terms allowed by symmetry read (fk = 0)

1,2,−1/F (2)
22 .
The coeﬃcients A(ω, C) and B(ω, C) are complex and
in general depend on frequency ω and a control parameter
which we denote by C. A Hopf bifurcation occurs at a
critical point C = Cc at which A vanishes for a frequency
ωc, i.e. A(ωc, Cc) = 0. This can be demonstrated as
follows: A spontaneously oscillating solution satisﬁes

|x1|2 = −

A
B

(A7)

Note, that such a solution can only exist if A/B is real
and negative. At the bifurcation point, A = 0 and A/B
is therefore real for ω = ωc, however the corresponding
amplitude |x1|2 vanishes. In the vicinity of this point we
expect to ﬁnd solutions with ﬁnite amplitude. We use
the expansion

8

A(ω, C) ≃ (ω − ωc)A1 + (C − Cc)A2

(A8)

where A1 and A2 are complex coeﬃcients and we neglect
higher order terms. Spontaneous oscillating solutions ex-
ist only if A/B is real. This condition is satisﬁed for a
particular frequency ω = ωs with

ωs = ωc +

Im(A2/B)
Im(A1/B)

(Cc − C)

.

(A9)

the linear term in (A11) dominates. In this regime, the
response is linear,

|x1| ≃

|f1|

|(ω − ωc)A1|

,

(A14)

and the gain is constant. This is a passive response if the
stimulus frequency is too far from the critical frequency.

The ratio −A/B at this frequency ωs changes sign for
C = Cc; here we assume without loss of generality that it
is positive for C < Cc. In this case, the system oscillates
spontaneously with an amplitude which according to Eq.
(A7) behaves as |x1|2 = ∆2(Cc − C)/Cc, where
∆2 = Cc(cid:18)Re(A2/B) − Re(A1/B)

Im(A1/B)(cid:19)

Im(A2/B)

(A10)

is a typical amplitude. We have thus demonstrated that
Eq. (A6) characterizes a Hopf-bifurcation if the complex
coeﬃcient A vanishes at a critical point Cc for a critical
frequency ωc.

3. Ampliﬁed response to sinusoidal stimuli

If a sinusoidal stimulus f (t) = f1eiωt + f−1e−iωt, for

which all fn with n 6= ±1 vanish, Eq. (A6) becomes

f1 ≃ Ax1 + B|x1|2x1

.

(A11)

We consider a system that is tuned exactly to the bifurca-
tion, C = Cc. In this situation spontaneous oscillations
do not occur and A = (ω − ωc)A1. If the imposed fre-
quency is equal to the critical frequency ω = ωc, the
coeﬃcient A vanishes and we can solve Eq. (A11) for
|x1| to ﬁnd the nonlinear response

|x1| ≃ |B|−1/3|f1|1/3

,

(A12)

as a function of the force amplitude |f1|. This behavior
represents an ampliﬁed response with a gain

r =

|x1|
|f1|

∼ |f1|−2/3

(A13)

that becomes arbitrarily large for small forces.
If the
frequency ω is diﬀerent from ωc, this nonlinear response
still holds as long as the linear term in Eq. (A11) is small
compared to the cubic term and can be neglected. This
is the case if |x1|2 ≫ |A/B| = |ω − ωc||A1/B|. There-
fore, the nonlinear regime characterized by Eq.
(A12)
holds for suﬃciently large force amplitudes, |f1| ≫ |(ω −
ωc)A1|3/2/|B|1/2, or if the frequency is suﬃciently close
to the critical frequency, |ω − ωc| ≪ |f1|2/3|B|1/3/|A1|.

If the frequency mismatch |ω − ωc| becomes large, or
if forces |f1| are small, a new regime occurs for which

4. Additional remarks

The above derivation is based on an expansion (A3) in
the displacements xn. This excludes some nonlinearities
in the force which can lead to additional nonlinear terms
in Eq. (A11). The most general form of Eq. (A11) is

f1 ≃ Ax1 + B|x1|2x1 + Cx1|f1|2 + Dx−1f 2
1
1f−1 + G|f1|2f1

+ E|x1|2f1 + F x2

.

(A15)

However, for small forces f1 and small amplitudes x1,
the results derived above are not aﬀected. The regime
of nonlinear reponse |f1| ∼ |x1|3, as well as the linear
response regime |f1| ∼ |x1| still exist. If |f1| ∼ |x1|, the
nonlinear terms in f1 renormalize the third order term,
If |f1| ∼ |x1|3, the
which in this regime is negligable.
nonlinear terms in f1 are of even higher order and can
be neglected.

APPENDIX B: OSCILLATIONS GENERATED BY

MOLECULAR MOTORS

1. Two state model

The two state model describes force-generation as a re-
sult of transitions between two states, a bound state and
a detached state of a motor and its track ﬁlament. The
interaction between a motor at position z along the ﬁla-
ment in states 1 and 2 is characterized by two periodic
potentials W1(z) = W1(z + l) and W2(z) = W2(z + l)
where l is the period. We introduce the relative position
ξ = z mod l with respect to the potential period. De-
tachment and attachment rates are denoted ω1(ξ) and
ω2(ξ), respectively. Oscillations can occur in this model
if a large number N of motors move collectively against
an external elastic element of modulus K.

We introduce the probability P1(ξ) and P2(ξ) of ﬁnding
a motor bound at position ξ in state 1 or 2, which satisfy
the normalization condition

Z l

0

dξ(P1 + P2) = 1

(B1)

For a large number of motors collectively moving with
the same velocity v the dynamic equations read

∂tP1 + v∂ξP1 = −ω1P1 + ω2P2
∂tP2 + v∂ξP2 = ω1P1 − ω2P2

(B2)

(B3)

with

f1 ≃ Az1

(B14)

The velocity v is determined by the force-balance condi-
tion

f = λv + Kz + N Z l

0

dξ(P1∂ξW1 + P2∂ξW2)

(B4)

where λ is a friction coeﬃcient describing the total fric-
tion and z is the displacement of the motors, ∂tz = v. For
an incommensurate arrangement of motors with respect
to the track ﬁlament and a large number N of motors,
P1(ξ) + P2(ξ) = 1/l and the equations of motions sim-
plify:

∂tP + v∂ξP = −(ω1 + ω2)P + ω2/l

,

(B5)

where we denote for simplicity P (ξ) = P1(ξ).

We discuss a simple choice for the potentials and tran-
sition rates for which the Hopf bifurcation is easy to de-
termine analytically. We consider the potential

W1(ξ) = U cos(2πξ/l)

(B6)

with amplitude U , and the potential W2 to be constant.
The transition rates are chosen to be periodic functions

ω1(ξ) = β − β cos(2πξ/l)
ω2(ξ) = α − β + β cos(2πξ/l)

(B7)

(B8)

parameterized by two coeﬃcients α and β. With this
choice,

ω1(ξ) + ω2(ξ) = α

(B9)

is constant and the fact that ω1 and ω2 are positive re-
stricts β to the interval 0 ≤ β ≤ α/2.

2. Linear response function

In order to determine the linear coeﬃcient A which
determines the stability of the system, we look for small
amplitude oscillations close to the resting state with v =
0. We write

P ≃ p0 + p1eiωt
f ≃ f1eiωt
z ≃ z1eiωt

(B10)

(B11)
(B12)

where p0 = ω2/αl. To linear order in z1, we ﬁnd from
Eq. (B5)

p1 = −

iωz1
iω + α

∂xp0

(B13)

The corresponding force is given by

A = iωλ + K + χ ,

(B15)

where the active response χ of the motors is given by

χ = −N Z l

0

dξ

iω

iω + α

∂ξp0∂ξW1

(B16)

For the choice of Eq. (B6) and (B8) the integral can be
calculated and we obtain

A(C, ω) = iωλ + K − N k0C

iω/α + (ω/α)2

1 + (ω/α)2

.

(B17)

Here, we have introduced the dimensionless control pa-
rameter C ≡ 2π2β/α with 0 < C < π2 and the cross-
bridge elasticity k0 ≡ U/l2 of the motors.

3. Hopf bifurcation

A Hopf bifurcation occurs if there is a pair of values
(C, ω) for which A as given by Eq. (B17) vanishes. Such
a point indeed exists. For the critical value

Cc =

λα + K

N k0

the bifurcation occurs for the critical frequency

ωc = (cid:18) Kα

λ (cid:19)1/2

(B18)

(B19)

The critical frequency is bounded by the fact that Cc <
π2. The maximal frequency occurs for the maximal pos-
sible value of K

Kmax = N k0π2 − λα

(B20)

for which Cc = π2. This frequency is given by

ωmax = α(cid:18)N π2 k0

λα

− 1(cid:19)1/2

(B21)

Note, that the maximal frequency can be signiﬁcantly
higher than the typical rate α of the chemical cycle.

Abstract. –

We formulate and solve a two-state model for the elasticity of nicked, double-stranded DNA
that borrows features from both the Worm Like Chain and the Bragg–Zimm model. Our model
is computationally simple, and gives an excellent ﬁt to recent experimental data through the
entire overstretching transition. The ﬁt gives the ﬁrst value for the bending stiﬀness of the
overstretched state as about 10 nm · kBT , a value quite diﬀerent from either B-form or single-
stranded DNA.

Introduction and Summary. – When double-stranded DNA is subjected to longitudinal
forces greater than about 65 pN it undergoes a radical conformational change, marked by a
sudden, almost twofold increase in contour length [1,2]. The structural characterization of the
resulting overstretched or (“S-state”) DNA is complicated by the fact that techniques such
as X-ray crystallography are not applicable to single molecules. In this Letter, we instead
characterize overstretched DNA by examining its elastic constants, and to this end formulate
and solve a model that synthesizes features of both the Worm Like Chain (WLC) and the
Bragg–Zimm model of the helix–coil transition in peptides. Thus we model DNA as consisting
of two diﬀerent, coexisting conformations, each with its own elastic constants. We solve this
model and show that it gives a good ﬁt to recent data on the overstretching transition in
nicked, double-stranded DNA. From these ﬁts, we conclude that the bend stiﬀness of S-DNA
is intermediate between the known values for single stranded and double stranded DNA. Our
result supports the work of L´eger et al. [3, 4], who argued that S-DNA has a deﬁnite helical
pitch and hence is a new duplex conformation of DNA.

Our model and solution method diﬀer from those oﬀered by Marko [5], who assumes the
bend stiﬀnesses of the two conformational states to be identical; our analysis will show that
on the contrary the stiﬀnesses are markedly diﬀerent. The analysis of Viovy and Cizeau [6] is
essentially a mean-ﬁeld approximation to the model we study here; in addition, the authors
did not quote any value for the S-DNA bend stiﬀness, presumably because the experimental
data available at that time did not permit such a determination.

The model studied here is a continuum limit of a more general class of discrete persistent-
chain models. Such models give better ﬁts to the stretching curves of single-stranded DNA
than either the continuum WLC or the freely jointed chain models. Details will appear
elsewhere [7].

Our model and method are also of some general interest beyond DNA. For example, both

can be adapted to the study of the stretching of polypeptides with a helix-coil transition.

Model. – We begin by formulating a discretized form of the WLC, which we call the the
“Discrete Persistent Chain.” Later we will introduce an Ising-like variable on each chain link
describing a cooperative transition from B- to S-form.

The DPC models the polymer as a chain of N segments of length b, whose conformation
for each segment. Thus the

Analogously to ref. [9], it is straightforward to add an intrinsic stretch modulus to the

calculation outlined above, obtaining an “Extensible DPC” model.

To study overstretching, we now extend the extensible DPC by giving each link a discrete
1. We will take σ = +1 to mean the segment is in the
variable σ, which takes the values
1 for the S-state. The factor by which a segment elongates when going from
B-state and σ =
B to S will be called ζ, i.e. b(S) = ζb (with ζ > 1). We assign a bend stiﬀness parameter A to
B-DNA, and a diﬀerent A(S)
βζA to S-DNA; β is a dimensionless parameter with βζ < 1.
Similarly we assign a bend stiﬀness ηA to a hinge joining a B and an S segment.

Continuum Limit. – We could now proceed to evaluate the force-extension relation
of the Ising-DPC model, by evaluating eq. 10 numerically and using eq. 3. To simplify the
calculations, however, we ﬁrst pass to a continuum limit. To justify this step, we note that the
continuum (WLC) approximation gives a good account of single-stranded DNA stretching out
to forces beyond those probed in overstretching experiments (about 90 pN) [11]. As mentioned
earlier, the continuum approximation is also quite good for double-stranded DNA, because
the latter’s persistence length is so much longer than its monomer size.
In the continuum limit b is sent to zero holding Ltot ﬁxed; hence N

two states respectively (eq. 7). This procedure yields theoretical force-extension curves like
the one plotted in Fig. (1).

Discussion of ﬁt. – Fig. (1) shows a ﬁt to some recent experimental data (similar data
appear in [12]). Our model reproduces the experimental data rather well, but with so many
ﬁt parameters one may ask whether it actually makes any falsiﬁable predictions. To answer
this question we note that the data below the transition suﬃce to ﬁx A and E(B) as usual,
roughly speaking from the curvature and slope of the curve below the transition. Similarly,
the data above the transition ﬁx A(S) = ζβA and E(S). The vertical jump in the curve at

features of the data. Two additional, independent features of the data now remain, namely
the rounding of the curve at the start and end of the transition. Our model predicts these
features fairly succesfully.

Q

The ﬁt recovers the known values for the eﬀective persistence length of B-DNA of around
50 nm and its stretch modulus of about 1000 pN. Our ﬁrst result is that the bend stiﬀness of
S-DNA from our ﬁt as A(S) = βζA = 12.32 nm. Similar results were obtained using the older
data of Cluzel et al. [1, 7]. If S-DNA consisted of two unbound, single strands, we might have
expected A(S) to be twice as large as the value Ass
0.75 nm appropriate to single-stranded
DNA (as obtained from stretching experiments on ssDNA, restricted to forces above those
required to pull out secondary structure (2) [2, 11, 7]). On the contrary, we ﬁnd that the bend
stiﬀness of S-DNA is intermediate between that of B-DNA and that of two single strands.

≈

Finally, our ﬁt gives the stretch modulus of S-DNA is substantially higher than that of
B-DNA. This conclusion is consistent with the idea that the contour length of S-DNA is
determined by its covalently bonded sugar-phosphate backbones, which are much straighter
than in B-DNA; the contour length of B-DNA is instead determined by weaker, base-stacking
interactions.

Relation to prior work. – Several authors have studied the entropic elasticity of two-state
chains. As soon as the overstretching transition was discovered, Cluzel proposed a pure Ising
model by analogy to the helix-coil transition [14]. Others then introduced entropic elasticity,
but required that both states have the same bending stiﬀness as B-DNA [5, 15] or took one of
the two states to be inﬁnitely stiﬀ [16], or to be a FJC [17]. Also several earlier works made
a mean-ﬁeld approximation instead of diagonalizing the full transfer matrix. We believe our
Ising-DPC model to be the ﬁrst consistent formulation incorporating the coexistence of two
diﬀerent states with arbitrary elastic constants. Our approach also is calculationally more
straightforward than some, and minimal in the sense that no unknown potential function
needs to be chosen.

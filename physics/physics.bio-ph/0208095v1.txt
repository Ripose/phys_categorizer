Solving the riddle of the bright mismathes:

hybridization in oligonuleotide arrays

HDONA tehnology is prediated on two ideas. First, the di(cid:27)erential between high-a(cid:30)nity (per-

fet math, PM) and lower-a(cid:30)nity (mismath, MM) probes is used to minimize ross-hybridization

[2, 3℄. Seond, several short probes along the transript are ombined, introduing redundany.

Both ideas have shown problems in pratie: MMs are often brighter than PMs, and it is hard to

ombine the pairs beause their brightness often spans deades [4, 5, 6℄. Previous analysis suggested

these problems were sequene-related; publiation of the probe sequenes has permitted us an in-

depth study of this issue. Our results suggest that (cid:29)uoresently labeling the nuleotides interferes

with mRNA binding, ausing a ath-22 sine, to be deteted, the target mRNA must both glow

and stik to its probe: without labels it annot be seen even if bound, while with too many it won't

bind. We show that this on(cid:29)it auses muh of the omplexity of HDONA raw data, suggesting

that an aurate physial understanding of hybridization by inorporating sequene information is

neessary to perfet miroarray analysis.

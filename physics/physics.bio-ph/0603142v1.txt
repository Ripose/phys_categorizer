1 Introduction

The ﬁrst half of this chapter describes the development in mathematical models of
Brownian motion after Einstein’s seminal papers [1] and current applications to opti-
cal tweezers. This instrument of choice among single-molecule biophysicists is also
an instrument of precision that requires an understanding of Brownian motion be-
yond Einstein’s. This is illustrated with some applications, current and potential, and
it is shown how addition of a controlled forced motion on the nano-scale of the
tweezed object’s thermal motion can improve the calibration of the instrument in
general, and make it possible also in complex surroundings. The second half of the
present chapter, starting with Sect. 9, describes the co-evolution of biological motil-
ity models with models of Brownian motion, including very recent results for how
to derive cell-type-speciﬁc motility models from experimental cell trajectories.

2 Einstein’s Theory

When Einstein in 1905 formulated the theory that quickly became known as his the-
ory for Brownian motion, he did not know much about this motion1 He was looking
for observable consequences of what was then called the molecular-kinetic theory of

1 Just how much he knew seems an open question that may never be answered [2].

heat. So he was not concerned about the ﬁner details of speciﬁc situations. In fact,
apart from dated mathematical language, his papers on Brownian motion [1] remain
paradigms for how to model the essence of a phenomenon with ease and transparency
by leaving out everything that can possibly be left out.

The simplest version of his theory,

˙x(t) = (2D)

2 η(t) ,

1

(1)

for the trajectory x(t) of a Brownian particle, here in one dimension and in the lan-
guage of Langevin [3, 4], works so well also for real experimental situations that its
extreme simplicity may be overlooked: No simpliﬁcation of this theory is possible.
The white noise η(t) is the simplest possible:

For all t, t′,

hη(t)i = 0 and hη(t)η(t′)i = δ(t − t′) .

(2)

When this noise is normalized as done here—as simple as possible—the dimensions
of x and η require that a constant with dimension of diffusion coefﬁcient appears
where it does in (1). Equation (1) is mathematically equivalent to the diffusion equa-
tion, introduced by Fick in 1857, in which the diffusion coefﬁcient D is already
deﬁned, and that determines the factor 2D in (1). The new physics was in Ein-
stein’s assumption that Brownian particles also diffuse, and in his famous relation,
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem

which relates their diffusion coefﬁcient D and their Stokes’ friction coefﬁcient γ0 via
the Boltzmann energy kBT . It is derived by introducing a constant external force ﬁeld
in (1), and assuming Boltzmann statistics in equilibrium. For a spherical particle,

D = kBT /γ0 ,

γ0 = 6πρνR ,

(3)

(4)

where ρ is the density of the ﬂuid, ν its kinematic viscosity, and R is the sphere’s
radius.

3 The Einstein-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Theory

Details left out in the model described in (1–4) will be found missing, of course, if
one looks in the right places. For example, the length of the trajectory x(t) is inﬁnite
for any ﬁnite time interval considered2. Ornstein and Uhlenbeck [5, 6] showed that
this mathematical absurdity does not appear in Langevin’s equation [3],
2 Consider an interval of duration t. Split it into N intervals of duration ∆t = t/N . In each of
these, the mean squared displacement of the Brownian particle is 2D∆t. So on the average,
−1/2.
the distance travelled in a time interval of duration ∆t is proportional to (∆t)1/2 ∝ N
Consequently, the distance travelled in a time interval of duration t is proportional to t1/2 ∝
N 1/2. Let N → ∞, and the inﬁnite trajectory has been demonstrated. The proof can be
made mathematically rigorous in the formalism of Wiener processes, e.g., which is just the
mathematical theory of Brownian motion.

m¨x(t) = −γ0 ˙x(t) + Fthermal(t) ,

where m is the inertial mass of the Brownian particle, and the force from the sur-
rounding medium is written as a sum of two terms: Stokes friction, −γ0 ˙x, and
a random thermal force Fthermal = (2kBT γ0)1/2 η(t) with “white noise” statistical
properties following from (2). The random motion resulting from (5) is known as the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OU-process). In the limit of vanishing m, Einstein’s
theory is recovered. Together, they make up the Einstein-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory
of Brownian motion.

The OU-process improves Einstein’s simple model for Brownian motion by tak-
ing the diffusing particle’s inertial mass into account. As pointed out by Lorentz [7],
however, this theory is physically correct only when the particle’s density is much
larger than the ﬂuid’s. When particle and ﬂuid densities are comparable, as in the
motion Brown observed, neither Einstein’s theory nor the OU-process are consis-
tent with hydrodynamics. This is seen from exact results by Stokes from 1851 and
by Boussinesq from 1903 for the force on a sphere that moves with non-constant
velocity, but vanishing Reynolds number, through an incompressible ﬂuid. Hydro-
dynamical effects that the OU-process ignores, are more important than the inertial
effect of the particle’s mass. These effects are the frequency-dependence of friction
and the inertia of entrained ﬂuid. Stokes obtained the friction coefﬁcient, (4), for mo-
tion with constant velocity [8]. Brownian motion is anything but that. Also, mass and
momentum of the ﬂuid entrained by a sphere doing rectilinear motion with constant
velocity is inﬁnite according to Stokes solution to Navier-Stokes equation [8, 9]. This
gives a clue that entrained ﬂuid matters, and the pattern of motion too.

But since Einstein’s theory explained experiments well, this hydrodynamical as-
pect of Brownian motion did not demand attention. Not until computers made it
possible to simulate molecular dynamics.

4 Computer Simulations: More Realistic than Reality

In 1964–66 Rahman simulated liquid Argon as a system of spheres that interacted
with each other through a Lennard-Jones potential [10, 11]. He measured a number
of properties of this simple liquid, including the velocity auto-correlation function
φ(t) = hv(t) · v(0)i, which showed an initial rapid decrease, followed by a slow ap-
proach to zero from below, i.e., there was a negative long-time tail. Several attempts
were made to explain his results theoretically, with mixed success.

In the years 1967–1970 Alder and Wainwright simulated liquid Argon as a sys-
tem of hard spheres and observed hydrodynamic patterns in the movement of spheres
surrounding a given sphere, though all the spheres supposedly did Brownian mo-
tion [12, 13]. Using a simple hydrodynamical dimension argument, and supporting
its validity with numerical solutions to Navier-Stokes equations, they argued that
the velocity auto-correlation function has a positive power-law tail, φ(t) ∝ t−3/2 in
three-dimensional space. This result is in conﬂict with the velocity auto-correlation
function for the OU-process, which decreases exponentially, with characteristic time

m/γ. But the 3/2 power-law tail agrees also with Alder and Wainright’s simulation
results for a simple liquid of hard spheres doing Brownian motion.

This made theorists [14] remember Stokes’ result from 1851 for the friction on a
sphere that moves with non-constant velocity: There are actually two Stokes’ laws,
published in the same paper [8]. Einstein had used the simplest one, the one for
movement with constant velocity, so the effect of accelerated motion is not accounted
for in his theory. Nor is it in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory. However, acceleration
of a particle in a ﬂuid also accelerates the ﬂuid surrounding the particle, in a vortex
ring (in three dimensions, and two vortices in two dimensions) that persists for long,
disappearing only by broadening at a rate given by the kinematic viscosity [13].
In this way the ﬂuid “remembers” past accelerations of the particle. This memory
affects the friction on the particle at any given time in a manner that makes the
dynamics of the particle depend on its past more than inertial mass can express. The
result is an effective dynamical equation for the particle, Newton’s Second Law with
a memory kernel, as we shall see.

5 Stokes Friction for a Sphere in Harmonic Rectilinear Motion

The friction coefﬁcient that is relevant for a more correct description of Brownian
motion, differs from the friction coefﬁcient that most often is associated with Stokes’
name, (4), but it is actually the main subject of reference [8]. Stokes was not ad-
dressing the hydrodynamics of Brownian motion in 1851, but the hydrodynamics of
an incompressible ﬂuid surrounding a sphere that does rectilinear harmonic motion
with no-slip boundary condition, at vanishing Reynolds number, and with the ﬂuid
at rest at inﬁnity. The equations describing this motion are linear, however, and any
trajectory of a particle can be written as a linear superposition of harmonic trajecto-
ries, by virtue of Fourier analysis [15]. So the ﬂow pattern around a sphere following
any trajectory can be written as a superposition of ﬂows around spheres in harmonic
motion, as long as the condition of vanishing Reynolds number is satisﬁed by the
arbitrary trajectory. It is for a Brownian particle’s trajectory, so Stokes’ result for
harmonic motion is fundamental for the correct description of Brownian motion.

In general, the instantaneous friction experienced by a rigid body that moves
through a dense ﬂuid like water, depends on the body’s past motion, since the past
motion determines the ﬂuid’s present motion. For a sphere performing rectilinear
harmonic motion x(t; f ) with cyclic frequency ω = 2πf in an incompressible ﬂuid
and at vanishing Reynolds number, Stokes found the “frictional” force [8],[9, §24,
Problem 5],

where only the term containing ˙x(t; f ) = −i2πf x(t; f ) dissipates energy, while the
term containing ¨x(t; f ) = −(2πf )2x(t; f ) is an inertial force from entrained ﬂuid.
The notation is the same as above: γ0 is the friction coefﬁcient of Stokes’ law for
rectilinear motion with constant velocity, (4). The penetration depth δ characterizes
the exponential decrease of the ﬂuid’s velocity ﬁeld as function of distance from the
oscillating sphere. It is frequency dependent,

and large compared to R for the frequencies we shall consider. For a sphere with
diameter 2R = 1.0 µm in water at room temperature where ν = 1.0 µm2/µs, fν ≡
ν/(πR2) = 1.3 MHz.

Note that the mass of the entrained ﬂuid, the coefﬁcient to ¨x in (6), becomes
inﬁnite in the limit of vanishing frequency f , i.e., the ﬂow pattern around a sphere
moving with constant velocity has inﬁnite momentum, according to Stokes’ steady-
state solution to Navier-Stokes’ equations.

6 Beyond Einstein: Brownian Motion in a Fluid

The friction on a sphere that, without rotating, follows an arbitrary trajectory x(t)
with vanishing Reynolds number in an incompressible ﬂuid that is at rest at inﬁnity,
is found by Fourier decomposition of x(t) to a superposition of rectilinear oscillatory
motions ˜x(f ). Using (6) on these, gives

˜Ffriction(f ) = −γStokes(f )(−i2πf ) ˜x(f ) ,

which Fourier transforms back to [15],

see overviews in [18, 19] 3. Brieﬂy, Brownian motion in a ﬂuid is the result of ﬂuc-
tuations in the ﬂuid described by ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics [9, Chapter XVII]4. In
this theory one assumes that the random currents split up into systematic and random
parts, the former obeying (Navier-)Stokes equation, the latter obeying a ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem. From this theory one derives the expression of the thermal force
on a sphere in the ﬂuid.

Note that this description did not invoke a scenario of randomly moving molecules
that bump into the micro-sphere and thus cause its Brownian motion. This scenario
is correct for Brownian motion in a dilute gas. It is of great pedagogical value in un-
dergraduate teaching. But it does not apply to ﬂuids! The scientiﬁc literature shows
that some undergraduates proceed to become scientists without realizing this limita-
tion on the scenario’s validity. However, the coarse-grained description that replaces
a molecular description with a hydrodynamical one, is a very good approximation on
the length- and time-scales of the thermal ﬂuctuations that drive the Brownian mo-
tion of a micron-sized sphere in a ﬂuid. This is why ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics [9,
Chapter XVII] is formulated by a “stochastization” [20, Sect. 4.6] of Navier-Stokes
equation, and not by coarse-graining Langevin equations for individual molecules in
the ﬂuid. The correct physical scenario to bear in mind is one of molecules squeezed
together “shoulder-to-shoulder” in a manner that allows only collective motion, sim-
ilar to that observed in a tightly packed crowd of people.

Equations (10–12) constitute the accepted hydrodynamically correct theory for
classical Brownian motion, i.e., in an incompressible ﬂuid. It differs from Einstein’s
theory in a manner that matters in practise with the precision that optical tweezers
have achieved recently [21, 22]; see Fig. 1.

Power spectra of micro-spheres in optical traps can be measured with stochastic
errors below 1% [21]. So the differences in Fig. 1 between Einstein’s simple theory
and the hydrodynamically correct theory for Brownian motion in a ﬂuid can be ex-
posed experimentally [21, 23, 24]. The form of the thermal force in (12), on the other
hand, remains a theoretical result. It is not a controversial result, it is not questioned.
But because it is a small effect, it has not yet been demonstrated experimentally.

3 Here we have written the frequency-dependent noise amplitude explicitly, and to this end

introduced ˜η(f ), the Fourier transform of a white noise η(t), normalized as in (2).

4 Readers familiar with the Green-Kubo theory of linear response to perturbations may ap-
preciate ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics as a case where the order of linearization and “stochas-
tization” [20, Sect. 4.6] is a non-issue by virtue of the Reynolds number for thermal ﬂuctu-
ations.

lution, i.e., low frequency, the error vanishes. Einstein made an excellent approximation when
he chose Stokes’ law for constant velocity to characterize motion along a fractal trajectory.

7 Power-Law Tails

In the absence of external forces, the position power spectrum of Brownian motion
following from (10–12) is

P (f ) ∝ h|˜x2|i ∝

2kBT ReγStokes(f )
|m(2πf )2 + i2πf γStokes(f )|2 .

(13)

Here, the frequency-dependent numerator is the power spectrum of the thermal force
in (11), while the denominator is given by the other terms in (11). The frequency-
dependent friction coefﬁcient, γStokes(f ), appears both in numerator and denomina-
tor, and both appearances contribute, with opposite signs, to the t−3/2 power-law tail
in the velocity auto-correlation function.

By Wiener-Khintchine’s theorem, the velocity auto-correlation function is

φ(t) = h ˙x(t) ˙x(0)i ∝

df e−i2πtf (2πf )2P (f ) .

quite different from the exponential decrease following from Einstein’s simple the-
ory, but not conceptually different from it [14, 16, 17].

Experimental evidence for this power-law tail remained sparse for years. Dy-
namic light scattering offered promise of its observation, but only Boon and Boullier
[25, 26] reported an experimental result of the magnitude predicted theoretically,
with statistical errors about half the size of the signal. Paul and Pursey used pho-
ton correlation dynamic laser light scattering to measure the time dependence of
the mean squared displacement of polystyrene spheres with radius R ∼ 1.7 µm [27].
They found clear evidence for the expected t−3/2-behavior (t1/2 in the mean squared
displacement), but with an amplitude of only 74 ± 3% of that predicted theoreti-
cally. They never found the reason why 26% of the theoretically expected amplitude
was missing [28]. Ohbayashi, Kohno, and Utiyama [29] also used photon correlation
spectroscopy, on a suspension of polystyrene spheres with radius 0.80 µm, and found
agreement between the theoretical amplitude of the t−3/2 tail and their experimen-
tal results which has 9–10% error bars. Their results also agree with the predicted
signiﬁcant temperature dependence. This convincing experiment thus supports the
validity of the theory (11). This is the current experimental status of the power-law
tail of the velocity auto-correlation function of classical Brownian motion.

Or was, when this chapter was written. But before it went into print, Ref. [24] ap-
peared. Strangely, the velocity auto-correlation function is not given in [24], though
its authors have measured what it takes to display its power-law tail. Instead, they
show the mean-squared-displacement of a diffusing micro-sphere. That quantity is
essentially the velocity auto-correlation function integrated twice, and consequently
contains the same power-law integrated twice.

The amplitude that was measured in all these experiments, albeit indirectly with
photon correlation spectroscopy, is the ﬁrst-order term in the expansion of P (f )
above, Eq. (15), in powers of (f /fν)1/2. This coefﬁcient has two contributions: One
from the denominator, from Stokes’ frequency-dependent friction coefﬁcient, and
another from the numerator. The latter is half-as-large as the former, and with oppo-
site sign. It stems from the noise term’s frequency dependence.

Instead of measuring a photon correlation function for laser light scattered off
a suspension of micro-spheres, developments in instrumentation [22] and data anal-
ysis [21] for optical tweezers have made it possible now to measure directly, with
accuracy and precision, on a single micro-sphere [24]. Thus it just might be possible
to observe directly the ”color” of the thermal noise, the frequency dependence of
the non-white power spectrum, in a very challenging single-particle experiment with
optical tweezers [30].

8 In Situ Calibration of Optical Tweezers by Forced Nano-Scale
Motion

There are many ways to calibrate an optical trap. Some ways are better than others
if accuracy and precision is a concern. In that case, the best way is based on the
motion’s power spectrum [21]. Two aspects must be calibrated: The spring constant
of the Hookean force exerted by the trap on a trapped micro-sphere (bead), and,
to this end, the millivolt-to-nanometer calibration factor. The latter tells us which
nanometer-displacement of the bead in the trap corresponds to a measured millivolt-
change in output potential of a photo diode in the position detection system used
with the tweezers. A common way to determine this calibration factor requires that
one knows the radius of the bead, the temperature and dynamic viscosity of the ﬂuid
surrounding it, and its distance to the nearby surface of the microscope cover slip, if,
as is usually the case, the experiment is done near this surface. One can then calculate
the bead’s diffusion coefﬁcient in m2/s using Stokes’ law (4), Einstein’s relation (3),
and Fax´en’s formula [31, 32][21, Sect. XI]. By comparing the result with the same
quantity measured experimentally in V2/s, the calibration factor is determined.

Fig. 2. Power spectrum of 1.54 µm diameter silica bead held in laser trap with corner frequency
fc = 538 Hz. The sample moves harmonically with amplitude A = 208 nm and frequency
fstage = 28 Hz. The power spectrum shown is the average of 48 independent power spectra,
sampled at frequency fsample = 20 kHz. The total sampling time was 79 s, which is six times
more than we normally would need to calibrate. It was chosen for the sake of illustration, to
reduce the relative amplitude of the Brownian motion, i.e., the scatter in the spectrum away
from the spike at 28 Hz.

10

D. Selmeczi et al.

A calibration of the photo diode that is much less dependent on a priori knowl-
edge, can be achieved by moving the ﬂuid cell with the bead harmonically relatively
to the laboratory with the optical trap [33]. With a piezo-electric translation stage
this can be done accurately with an amplitude of order 100 nm and frequency of
order 30 Hz. In the laboratory system of reference, the ﬂuid ﬂows back and forth
through the stationary trap with harmonically changing velocity. This gives rise to an
external force on the trapped bead in (11), a harmonically changing Stokes friction
force,

Fexternal(t) = γ0vstage(t) = γ02πfstageA cos(2πfstage(t − t0)) ,

(17)

where A and fstage are, respectively, the amplitude and frequency with which the
stage is driven, and t0 is its phase. The amplitude A can be chosen so small that the
forced harmonic motion of the bead in the trap is masked by its Brownian motion,
when observed in the time domain. Nevertheless, when observed long enough, the
forced harmonic motion stands out in the power spectrum of the total motion as a
dominating spike; see Fig. 2. This spike is the dynamic equivalent of the scale bar
plotted in micrographs: The “power” contained in it is known in m2 because the
bead’s motion in nanometers follows from its equation of motion and the known
motion of the stage, measured in nanometers. The bead’s motion is measured in
Volts, however, by the photo-detection system, and the Volt-to-meter calibration fac-
tor depends on the chosen signal ampliﬁcation, laser intensity, etc. So calibration is
necessary. It is done by identifying the two values for the power in the spike: The
measured value in V2 with the known value in m2 [33]5. This method resembles
an old method of calibration that moves the bead back and forth periodically with
constant speed, but harmonic motion has a number of technical advantages. One is
that the precision of power spectral analysis demonstrated in [21] can be maintained,
while adding the advantage of not having to know the bead’s radius, nor its distance
to a nearby surface, nor the ﬂuid’s viscosity and temperature. On the contrary, the
combination of these parameters that occurs in the expression (3) for the bead’s dif-
fusion coefﬁcient, is determined experimentally from its Brownian motion, so, e.g.,
the bead’s radius is measured to the extent the other parameter values are known.
But also, this calibration method can be used in situ, where an experiment is to be
done, by conﬁning the bead’s forced motion to this environment. This is useful for
measurements taking place near a surface, in a gel, or inside a cell.

5 A spike similar to the one shown here in Fig. 2 is seen in [34, Fig. 1b]. It was produced with
a bead embedded in polyacrylamide, hence not moving thermally, and not optically trapped.
It was used to demonstrate the high sensitivity of the authors’ position detection system.
It was also used for Volts-to-meters calibration of the detection system, and gave 10%
agreement with the same calibration factor obtained from the power spectrum of Brownian
motion. The optical properties of polyacrylamide differ from those of water, however, so it
is an open question how accurate that calibration method can be made. Obviously, it is not
an in situ calibration method.

9 Biological Random Motion

Robert Brown did not discover Brownian motion, and he, a botanist, got his name as-
sociated with this physical phenomenon because he in 1827 carefully demonstrated
what it is not, a manifestation of life, leaving the puzzle of its true origin for oth-
ers to solve. Brownian motion has been known for as long as the microscope, and
before the kinetic theory of heat it was natural to assume that “since it moves, it is
alive.” Brown killed that idea. But after Einstein in 1905 had published his theory
for Brownian motion, Przibram in 1913 demonstrated that this theory describes also
the self-propelled random motion of protozoa [35]. By tracking the trajectories x(t)
of individual protozoa, see Fig. 3, Przibram demonstrated that the net displacement
x(t) − x(0) averages to zero, while its square satisﬁes the relationship known for
Brownian motion,

hd(t)2i = 2ndimDt ,

(18)

where ndim is the dimension of the space in which the motion takes place.

Fig. 3. Example of Przibram’s motility data, a trajectory of a protozoon, hand-drawn with a
mechanical tracking device operated in real time with a microscope. A metronome was used
to mark time on the trajectory every four seconds [35].

In Einstein’s theory D is the diffusion coefﬁcient, and satisﬁes his famous re-
lation (3). Przibram found a value for D which was much larger and much more

sensitive to changes in temperature than Einstein’s relation states. He used this as
proof that it was not just Brownian motion that he had observed.

If Przibram, a biologist, had used a better time resolution by marking out points
in Fig. 3 more frequently than every four seconds, he might also have gotten ahead
of the physicists in theoretical developments. But he was drawing by hand, marking
time to a metronome, so marking points closer to 1 Hz must have been a challenge.
F¨urth, a physicist at the German university in Prague where Einstein had been a
professor for 16 months in 1911-12, also studied the motility of protozoa. First he
repeated Przibram’s results, apparently without knowing them [36]. Later he found
that his data [37] were not described by (18). He consequently considered a random
walker on a lattice, and gave the walker directional persistence in the form of a
bias towards stepping in the direction of the step taken previously. By taking the
continuum limit, he, independently of Ornstein [5, 6], demonstrated that for random
motion with persistence, (18) is replaced by

hd(t)2i = 2ndimD(t − P (1 − e−t/P )) ,

(19)

where P is called the persistence time, and characterizes the time for which a given
velocity is “remembered” by the system [37].

Ornstein solved (5), since known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Its so-
lution also gives (19), with P ≡ m/γ. The physical meaning of the three terms in the
OU-process does not apply for cells: Their velocities are measured in micrometers
per hour, so their inertial mass means absolutely nothing for their motion. Friction
with the surrounding medium also is irrelevant—the cells are ﬁrmly attached to the
substrate they move on—and it is not thermal forces that accelerate the cells. But as
a mathematical model the OU-process is the simplest possible of its kind, like the
harmonic oscillator, the Hydrogen atom, and the Ising model. It also agrees with the
earliest data. Consequently, the OU-process became the standard model for motility.
We can write it as

P

dv
dt

= −v + (2D)1/2η ,

where each component of η is a white noise normalized as in (2) and uncorrelated
with the other components.

hη(t)i = 0 ;

hηj(t′)ηk(t′′)i = δj,kδ(t′ − t′′) .

(20)

(21)

Here δ(t) and δj,k are, respectively Dirac’s and Kronecker’s δ-functions, and η(t) is
assumed uncorrelated with v(t′) for t ≥ t′. F¨urth’s formula (19) is a consequence of
equations (20) and (21), but follows also from other, similar theories. It was often the
only aspect of the theory that was compared with experimental data, and with good
reason, considering the limited quality of data.

Gail and Boone [38] seem to have been the ﬁrst to model cell motility with (19).
They did a time study of ﬁbroblasts from mice by measuring the cells’ positions
every 2.5 hrs. Equation (19) ﬁtted their results fairly well. Since then, cell motility
data have routinely been ﬁtted with (19). Its agreement with data can be impressive,
and is usually satisfactory—sometimes helped by the size of experimental error bars

Brownian Motion after Einstein

13

and few points at times t that are comparable to P . Data with these properties cannot
distinguish (19) from other functions that quickly approach 2ndimD(t − P ).

Equation (19) is essentially a double integral of the velocity auto-correlation

function φ(t) of the OU-process, where

φ(t) = hv(0) · v(t)i =

ndimD
P

e−|t|/P .

(22)

Experimental results for the velocity auto-correlation function are better suited for
showing whether the OU-process is a reasonable model for given data. But exper-
imental results for velocities are calculated as ﬁnite differences from time-lapse
recordings of positions. If the time-lapse is short, precision is low on differences,
hence on computed velocities. Yet, if the time-lapse is longer, the time resolution
of the motion is poor. The solution is somewhere in between, compensating for lost
precision with good statistics. Good statistics was not really achievable till computer-
aided object-tracking became possible.

Fig. 4. Isolated human dermal keratinocytes are motile by nature. If not surrounded by other
cells, they react as if in a wound: They search for other cells of the same kind with which
they can connect to form skin. Trajectories are formed from 15 min time-lapse photography.
Trajectories as those shown here in the right panel make up the raw data that are analyzed
statistically to ﬁnd a suitable stochastic model for the motility of these keratinocytes. The
black bar is 0.2 mm long.

We recently wanted to characterize the compatibility of human cells with various sur-
faces by describing the cells’ motility on the various surfaces [39]. Computer-aided
cell tracking—see Fig. 4—quickly gave us so much data that we found ourselves in
a new situation with regards to modelling: We were not limited to showing whether
or not there is agreement between data and a few consequences of a given model. We
could investigate the model itself experimentally, measure each term in its deﬁning
equation, check that their assumed properties are satisﬁed, and whether together they
satisfy the equation of motion.

Furthermore, before we checked the equation of motion, we could check whether
the data are consistent with various assumptions of symmetry and invariance on
which the equation of motion is based. We found that the cells behaved in a manner
consistent with the assumptions that their surroundings are isotropic, homogenous,
and constant in time. This allowed us to average data over all directions, places, and
times. This in turn improved the statistics of our investigation of the equation of
motion [39].

11 Tailor-Made Theory Replaces “One Theory Fits All”

The theory in (20) states that for a given velocity v the acceleration is a stochastic
variable with expectation value proportional to v,

h

dv
dt

iv = −v/P .

Figure 5AB shows that this is also the case for experimental data.

The theory in (20) states also that

dv
dt

dv
dt

dv
dt

− h

iv =

+ v/P = (2D)1/2η/P ,

(23)

(24)

i.e., that this quantity in the OU-process is a white noise with the same speed-
independent amplitude in both directions: parallel and orthogonal to the velocity.

Figure 5B shows that experimentally the amplitude of the two components of
this noise are indeed indistinguishable in the two directions, but the two amplitudes
are clearly not independent of the speed! Here we see the experimental data reject
the OU-process as model. The distribution of experimentally measured values of the
noise also reject the OU-process as model. Figure 5D shows clearly that it is not
Gaussian, as it is in the OU-process. Apart from that, Fig. 5C shows that the noise is
uncorrelated, like in (21), on the time scale where we have measured it. This result
radically simpliﬁes the mathematical task of constructing an alternative to the OU-
process on the basis of experimentally determined properties of these cells’ motility
pattern.

Fig. 5. Statistics accumulated from trajectories like those shown in Fig. 4. A: The two com-
ponents of the acceleration, as functions of speed. Panels A1 and A2 show the acceleration
parallel with, respectively orthogonal to, the velocity. These scatter plots show that the two
functions contain random parts, like the acceleration in (20). B: Data points with error bars:
Mean and standard deviation as function of speed for data shown in Panel A. Curves show
the same quantities, plus/minus one standard deviation, calculated from the theory given in
(25). C: Correlation functions for scatter shown in Panel A. Panels C1 and C2 show the auto-
correlations of the two components, C3 and C4 show the cross-correlation between the two,
for both signs of the time difference. The many values shown are almost all indistinguishable
from zero. This suggests that the scatter in data can be modelled with uncorrelated noise, as
in (21). This is an experimental result for the theory we seek. The curves shown are not ﬁts to
the data shown, but results of (25) after it has been ﬁtted to data in Panels B, E, and F. D: His-
tograms of scatters shown in Panel A, measured relatively to the means shown in Panel B,
and in units of the standard deviations shown in Panel B. The curves shown are not ﬁts to the
histograms shown, but results of (25) after it has been ﬁtted to data in Panels B, E, and F.
E: Velocity auto-correlation function, calculated from trajectories like those shown in Fig. 4.
It is not a simple exponential as in (22). But a sum of two exponentials ﬁt data perfectly. So
we assume that the theory we seek has a velocity auto-correlation function that is a sum of two
exponentials. The curves through the data points are that correlation function, plus/minus one
standard deviation, computed with the theory in (25), after it has been ﬁtted to the data shown
here, and simultaneously to the data in Panels B and F. F: Histograms of speeds and (speed)2
read off trajectories like those in Fig. 4. The curves shown are the same speed distributions
calculated from the theory in (25), after it has been ﬁtted to the data.

The velocity auto-correlation function of the OU-process is a simple exponential,
(22). Figure 5E shows the experimentally measured velocity auto-correlation func-
tion. It is ﬁtted perfectly by the sum of two exponentials, so again the experimental
data reject the OU-process as model.

The data shown in Fig. 5 are so rich in information that with a few assumptions
favored by Occam’s Razor one can deduce from the data which theory it takes to
describe the data, and this theory is unambiguously deﬁned by the data [39]. Results
from this theory are shown as the fully drawn curves passing through the data points
in Fig. 5. It is given by the stochastic integro-differential equation

where

σ(v) = σ0 + σ1v .

The integral over past velocities in (25) is called a memory-kernel by mathemati-
cians. It shows that these cells have memory. This is no surprise: The polarity of
the cytoskeleton of a moving cell is a manifest memory of direction, and while its
instantaneous velocity depends on the activity of transient pseudopodia, the fact that

Brownian Motion after Einstein

17

pseudopodia are active depends on states of the cell that last longer than the individ-
ual pseudopod, one would expect.

Note the similarity between (25) and the hydrodynamically correct theory for
Brownian motion, (10,11). Though both are more complex than Einstein’s theory,
applied by Przibram, and the OU-process, applied by F¨urth, they still have much in
common. This is so because they both are linear and both respect causality and the
same space-time symmetries.

Linearity is simplicity, so wherever in modelling it is sufﬁcient, one avoids going

beyond it. This is why (10,11) and (25) are both linear.

The Principle of Causality states that the future does not affect the present, in-
cluding present rates of change of state variables. Only the past can do this. This prin-
ciple is respected throughout physics, and we have of course built it into our motility
models as well. This is why the rate of change of the velocity given in (10,11), re-
spectively (25), depends only on past and present velocities. The integral kernels
occurring in both equations are memory kernels in order to respect this principle.

In a homogenous, isotropic environment that is constant in time, there is no ab-
solute position, direction, nor time. A theory for a dynamical system in such an en-
vironment consequently cannot depend on the position variable x, nor can it depend
explicitly on the time variable t, nor on explicit directions in space. The theory must
be translation invariant in space, time, and with respect to direction. The last invari-
ance is called covariance under rotations, because a theory for a vector variable like
the velocity is not invariant under rotations of the coordinate system, it is covariant,
i.e., transforms like the vector it describes. Because these space-time symmetries are
shared by hydrodynamics and our cells, neither (10,11) nor (25) depends on x, nor
explicitly on t, and both models transform like a vector under rotations.

We conclude that with the rich data that one now can record and process, one
should not be satisﬁed with the simplest possible model for persistent random mo-
tion, the OU-process. “One size ﬁts all” is no longer true, if it ever was. Motility
models can be made to measure. Here we have only presented the ﬁrst phenomeno-
logical steps of that process: How to plot and read motility data in a manner that
reveals mathematical properties of the theory sought. That done, it is another task to
construct a model with the properties demanded. If that can be done, it is yet another
task to decide whether the theory is unique or not. Two examples of such theories
and their derivation are given in [39].

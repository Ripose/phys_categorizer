Abstract

Using a stochastic generalization of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, we consider the
inﬂuence of intrinsic channel noise on the synchronization between the spiking ac-
tivity of the excitable membrane and an externally applied periodic signal. For
small patches, i.e. when the channel noise dominates the excitable dynamics, we
ﬁnd the phenomenon of intrinsic coherence resonance. In this case, the relatively
regular spiking behavior is practically independent of the applied external driving;
therefore no synchronization occurs. Synchronization takes place, however, only for
suﬃciently large ion channel assemblies. The neuronal signal processing is thus likely
rooted in the collective properties of optimally large assemblies of ion channels.

ion channels, excitable dynamics, channel noise, synchronization

1 Introduction

A fundamental question in neurophysiology concerns the limiting factors of
the reliability of neuronal responses to given stimuli. In this article we fo-
cus on a particular aspect of this complex issue: the impact of channel noise,
which is generated by random gating dynamics of the ion channels in mem-
brane patches of ﬁnite size. In particular, we investigate the eﬀect of channel
noise on the synchronization between the action potential produced by the
cell membrane patch of ﬁnite size and the applied periodic stimulus.

The topic of synchronization, especially in biological systems, attracts ever
growing interest, see Refs. [1,2,3,4]. Some prominent examples are the collec-
tive ﬂashing of ﬁreﬂies [5], the synchronization between the respiratory and
cardiac activity in human cardiorespiratory system [6], and the signal process-
ing in sensory systems [7,8]. Recently, the phenomena of frequency and phase
synchronization have been explored in presence of ambient noise sources, both
for a noisy (overdamped) relaxation dynamics [3,9,10] and for an oscillatory
stochastic dynamics [3,11]. The theoretical research is further inspired by ex-
perimental activities, and vice versa. In the context of theoretical modeling,
the frequency and phase synchronization [12] has been observed, for example,
in the integrate-and-ﬁre model of the excitable dynamics driven by white noise
and an externally applied stochastic spike train [13]. For an optimal dose of
noise the mean ﬁring rate of the driven neuron becomes locked by the mean
frequency of the external spike train.

2 The Hodgkin-Huxley model

Our starting point is the well-established model of Hodgkin and Huxley [14].
The membrane patch of area S is considered as an electrical capacitor pos-
sessing the speciﬁc area capacitance C. The membrane separates two ionic
bath solutions (which in vivo correspond to the interior and the exterior of
the excitable cell) with diﬀerent concentrations of the ions of diﬀerent sorts,
−
mainly potassium, K+, sodium, Na+, and chloride, Cl
ions. The macroscopic
concentration diﬀerences are kept approximately constant. In the cell, this
task is accomplished by the ATP-driven ionic pumps. Furthermore, the ionic
baths are on the average electrically neutral. However, due to the diﬀerent
ionic concentrations on the opposite sides of the semi-permeable membrane,
the membrane becomes charged. As a consequence, an equilibrium transmem-
brane electrical potential diﬀerence emerges. The lipid membrane creates an
almost impenetrable barrier for the ions. However, they can ﬂow across the
membrane through special ion selective pores created by specialized membrane
proteins – the ion channels [15]. The speciﬁc potassium, IK, and sodium, IN a,
ion currents through the open ion channels are approximately proportional
to the diﬀerences of the transmembrane potential V and the speciﬁc (for the
particular sort of ions) equilibrium potentials, EK and EN a, respectively. The
stochastically averaged, mean conductances, GNa(m, h) and GK(n), are, how-
ever, strongly nonlinear functions of V . This nonlinearity emerges due to the
gating dynamics (see below). There exists also the leakage current IL, mainly
due to the chloride ions. If the membrane is driven by the external current
Iext(t), the sum of the speciﬁc ion currents and the capacitive current, IC, must
be equal to Iext(t) as a consequence of the charge conservation. Therefore, the

equation for the transmembrane potential V (t) reads

C

V + GK(n) (V − EK) + GNa(m, h) (V − ENa)

d
dt

+ GL (V − EL) = Iext(t) .

(1)

For a squid giant axon, the parameters in Eq. (1) are ENa = 50 mV, EK =
−77 mV, EL = −54.4 mV, and C = 1 µF/cm2. Furthermore, the leakage con-
ductance is assumed to be constant, GL = 0.3 mS/cm2. On the contrary, the
sodium and potassium conductances are controlled by the voltage-dependent
gating dynamics of single ion channels and are proportional to their respective
numbers. These latter assumptions have been fully conﬁrmed in the single-
channel recordings by Neher, Sakmann and colleagues which indeed have
proven that ion channels undergo the opening-closing stochastic gating dy-
namics [16]. In the Hodgkin-Huxley model, the opening of the potassium ion
channel is governed by four identical activation gates characterized by the
opening probability n. The channel is open when all four gates are open. In
the case of sodium channel, the dynamics is governed by the three indepen-
dent, identical fast activation gates (m) and an additional slow, so-termed
inactivation gate (h). The independence of the gates implies that the proba-
bility PK,N a of the occurrence of the conducting conformation is PK = n4 for a
potassium channel and PNa = m3 h for a sodium channel, respectively. In the
mean-ﬁeld description, the macroscopic potassium and sodium conductances
thus read:

GK(n) = gmax

n4, GNa(m, h) = gmax

Na m3h ,

K = 36 mS/cm2 and gmax

Na = 120 mS/cm2 denote the maximal con-
where gmax
ductances (when all channels are open). The two-state, open–closing dynamics
of the gates is given by the voltage dependent opening and closing rates αx(V )
and βx(V ) (x = m, h, n), i.e.

αm(V ) =

0.1(V + 40)
1 − exp[−(V + 40)/10]
βm(V ) = 4 exp[−(V + 65)/18] ,
αh(V ) = 0.07 exp[−(V + 65)/20],
βh(V ) = {1 + exp[−(V + 35)/10]}−1 ,

,

αn(V ) =

0.01 (V + 55)
1 − exp[−(V + 55)/10]

,

βn(V ) = 0.125 exp[−(V + 65)/80] .

Hence, the dynamics of the opening probabilities for the gates are given by:

˙x = αx(V ) (1 − x) − βx(V ) x,

x = m, h, n .

The voltage equation (1), (2) and the rate equations of the gating dynam-
ics (3), (4) deﬁne the original, purely deterministic Hodgkin–Huxley model
[14] for the squid giant axon. Operating with the average number of open
channels, disregards, however, the corresponding number ﬂuctuations (the so-
called channel noise [16,17]). Therefore, the Hodgkin-Huxley model is valid,
strictly speaking, only within the limit of very large system size where these
ﬂuctuations can be neglected. The role of internal ﬂuctuations in membrane
patches of ﬁnite size cannot, however, be a priori neglected. In fact, the recent
theoretical studies make it clear that the channel noise can be functionally
important for the excitable dynamics [17,18,19,20].

3 Stochastic generalization of Hodgkin-Huxley model

To account for the eﬀect of channel noise, we use the model which presents
a stochastic generalization of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations (1-4) due to Fox
and Lu [21]. The dynamics of the gating variables is given by the following
Langevin equation:

˙x = αx(V ) (1 − x) − βx(V ) x + ξx(t),

x = m, h, n ,

(5)

with independent Gaussian white noise sources ξx(t) of vanishing mean which
take into account the ﬂuctuations of the number of open gates. The noise
strengths depend on the membrane voltage. The noise correlations assume
the following form for an excitable membrane patch with NNa sodium and NK
potassium ion channels [21]:

hξm(t)ξm(t′)i =

hξh(t)ξh(t′)i =

hξn(t)ξn(t′)i =

δ(t − t′) ,

δ(t − t′) .

To ensure the conﬁnement of the gating variables between 0 (all gates are
closed) and 1 (all gates are open) we implemented numerically the reﬂecting
boundaries at 0 and 1. With the assumption of homogeneous ion channel
densities, ρNa = 6 · 1013 m−2 = 60 µm−2 and ρK = 1.8 · 1013 m−2 = 18 µm−2,
the ion channel numbers are given by:

NNa = ρNaS, NK = ρKS .

With decreasing patch size S we observe from our numerical simulations of
the Langevin equations (5-6) the more and more increasing spiking activity
due to the internal channel noise, see Fig. 1.

the ﬂuctuations of the number of open ion channels dominate the dynamics; there-
fore more action potentials are produced, whereas for very large patch sizes the
intrinsic channel noise strength is not capable to produce corresponding voltage
spikes.

4 Synchronization in excitable membranes

4.1 Channel noise induced spiking activity: Intrinsic Coherence Resonance

We investigate numerically the inﬂuence of channel noise in the absence of ex-
ternal stimulation. For small internal noise strengths, i.e. large patch sizes,
the occurrence of action potentials is very rare in the autonomous, non-
driven regime: Iext = 0, see Fig. 1. The distribution of interspike intervals
{Ti := ti+1 − ti} is widely spread with longer intervals becoming less and less
probable, see the solid line in Fig. 2(a). With increasing channel noise the ﬁr-
ing rate increases as well, and the interspike interval time–histogram depicts
a more distinct peak structure, Fig. 2(b). For small membrane patches, the
ﬂuctuations of the number of open ion channels dominate the excitable dy-
namics and after a ﬁring event the membrane patch tends to ﬁre immediately
again, but after some refractory time which is necessary to achieve the resting
potential after hyperpolarization. The above elucidation suggests that with
decreasing patch size the spiking activity becomes more regular. A quantity
that measures this regularity is the so–called coeﬃcient of variation (CV ), or
the relative dispersion of the interspike interval distribution, i.e.

CV := q

hT 2i − hT i2
hT i

,

which involves the mean interspike interval hT i := limN→∞
and the mean squared interval hT 2i := limN→∞

(solid line) and the driven case, Iext = sin(0.3 · t), (dotted line) for two patch sizes:
(a) 16 µm2, and (b) 1 µm2. The driving independent single-peak-structure becomes
more and more accentuated for decreasing patch size, i.e. with increasing strength
of the channel noise. The refractory period Tr acts as lower bound to the inter-
spike intervals. It varies with the patch area and becomes smaller for smaller patch
sizes, cf. Tr ≈ 15 ms in part (a) vs. Tr < 10 ms in part (b). The driving–induced
peaks appear for suﬃciently small internal noise at multiples of the driving period
Tdriving ≈ 21 ms, cf. part (a). In case of dominating channel noise, the inﬂuence of
driving on the ISIH is barely distinguishable, cf. part (b).

uncorrelated sequence of spikes, which corresponds to the Poissonian spike
train, the coeﬃcient of variation would assume the value CV = 1. For a more
ordered spike train, the coeﬃcient of variation assumes values less then one,
CV < 1. For a purely deterministic signal, the CV equals to zero.

Fig. 3 depicts the coeﬃcient of variation (8) and the ﬁring rate k = 1/hT i.
While the ﬁring rate decreases monotonically with respect to the patch area,
the CV reveals the novel phenomenon of intrinsic coherence resonance [19].
At an optimal dose of internal noise, i.e. an optimal size of the cell membrane
patch near S = 1 µm2, the CV exhibits a minimum, where the spike train
becomes distinctly more ordered. With decreasing noise level (large S) this
feature becomes increasingly diminished, and the CV increases.

4.2 Sub-threshold sinusoidal driving

Next, we switch on an external, sub-threshold sinusoidal driving, i.e.

Iext := A sin(Ωt) .

(9)

with A < Ath, where Ath is the threshold amplitude of driving in the de-
2
terministic limit, S → ∞. For Ω = 0.3 ms−1 in Fig. 2, Ath ≈ 1.6 µA/cm
.
Interestingly enough the distribution of interspike intervals is not aﬀected
much for small patch sizes near S ≈ 1 µm2, cf. Fig. 2(b), where the solid and
dotted curves are barely distinguishable; see also Fig. 3(a) at S ≈ 1 µm2. In

sizes. (b) Firing rates k = 1/hT i for the undriven (solid line) and driven case (dotted
line, Iext = sin(0.3 · t)) are depicted versus the patch areas. While the ﬁring rate
is monotonically decreasing with increasing patch size the coeﬃcient of variation
evidences the phenomenon of intrinsic coherence resonance.

this case, the spiking activity possesses an internal rhythm which withstands
the external disturbances. For larger patch sizes the internal noise decreases
and the periodic driving induces peaks at multiples of the driving period, see
Fig. 2(a). In this regime the external driving imposes a more ordered spiking
activity which is characterized by a reduced CV , see Fig. 3(a).

4.3 The concept of stochastic phase processes: frequency synchronization

In order to explore the stochastic phase and and stochastic frequency synchro-
nization between the membrane spiking activity and the driving current, one
has to invoke the concept of a phase process linked to the stochastic voltage
signal V (t). The Hilbert phase φH(t) constitutes one such appropriate phase
deﬁnition. The corresponding approach is based on the Hilbert transform, it
has been originally introduced by Gabor [22,23]. The signal is extended into
the complex plane with the imaginary axis given by the Hilbert transform of
signal, V H, cf. Fig. 4:

zV (t) := V (t) + iV H(t) ,

with

V H(t) = H [V ] (t) =

The integral in (11) is evaluated in the sense of the Cauchy principal value
(P ). The Hilbert transform is then used to deﬁne the corresponding stochastic

.

Here, the phase should be understood as continuously growing function of
time. In Fig. 4(a) a realization of the voltage signal and the related Hilbert
transform are plotted. Each repeated ﬁring event corresponds to a cycle in the
{V, V H}–space, see 4(b)); it thus adds an 2π-increment to the phase of the
voltage signal. The corresponding Hilbert phase frequency ωH is then given by

ωH := lim
t→∞

φH(t)
t

.

An alternative phase deﬁnition uses the feature of the point process that is
generated by the spikes of the voltage signal V (t). These spikes deﬁne marker
events at times {ti} with each of them pinpointing the completion of a cy-
cle. The phase increase between two subsequent marker events is then given
exactly by 2π. Moreover, by a linear interpolation it is possible to deﬁne the
instantaneous phase φR(t); i.e.,

φR(t) = 2π

t − ti
ti+1 − ti

+ 2πi ,

(ti ≤ t ≤ ti+1) ,

(14)

where the times ti are ﬁxed by the marker events. The average frequency of
the process φR(t) is then given by:

where N(t) denotes the total number of spikes within the time interval [0, t].
The index R alludes to the so-called Rice frequency [3,11,24].

Since each action potential adds, on the one hand, the 2π-increment to the
Hilbert-phase and, on the other hand, deﬁnes the corresponding single marker
event, the Hilbert frequency equals the Rice frequency, although the two phase
deﬁnitions are diﬀerent.

4.4 Imperfect synchronization for a periodically driven membrane patch

Fig. 5. (a) The dependence of Rice frequency (15) on the patch size is plotted for
three sub-threshold amplitudes A of the sinusoidal stimulus Iext(t) = A sin(0.2 · t):
A = 0.0 µA/cm2 (short–dashed line), A = 2.02 µA/cm2 (dotted line), A = 2.05
µA/cm2 (long–dashed line), and for a super-threshold amplitude A = 2.2 µA/cm2
(dotted–dashed line). The threshold amplitude is Ath ≈ 2.1 µA/cm2. The level line
displays the angular driving frequency Ω = 0.2 ms−1. For subthreshold signals the
ﬁring rate vanishes for large areas and the Rice frequency approaches zero, while
for a super-threshold amplitude the driving frequency value is attained. (b) The
phase probability density p(φdr) of spiking events versus the phase φdr = Ωt of
the driving signal is plotted for A = 2.05 µA/cm2 and four diﬀerent patch areas:
S = 4 µm2 (solid line); S = 16 µm2 (short–dashed line); S = 64 µm2 (long–dashed
line); S = 256 µm2 (dotted–dashed line).

The dependence of the mean frequency ωR on the patch size is depicted in Fig.
5(a) for driving signals with frequency Ω = 0.2 ms−1 and for diﬀerent driving
amplitudes A. In the strong noise regime, the spiking activity is determined by
the internal noise and is independent of the driving frequency and amplitude.
For intermediate-to-small noise strengths the spike occurrences are locked to
multiples of the driving period, cf. Fig.2(a).

This synchronization behavior is also reestablished in the phase probability
density p(φdr) of spiking events in Fig.5(b). The latter quantity is deﬁned
with respect to the phase φdr = Ωt of the driving signal within the driving
period, i.e. 0 ≤ φdr < 2π. For small patch sizes, i.e. for a large channel noise,

9

the probability density p(φdr) is relatively ﬂat. When the channel noise di-
minishes a peak structure becomes more and more pronounced. It worth to
notice that spikes occur most frequently before the driving current reaches its
maximum at Ωt = π/2. The occurrence of the spike thus forecasts that the
signal’s maximum will be reached soon. This eﬀect is similar to the eﬀect of
anticipated synchronization between master and slave neurons [25]. Moreover,
a very interesting new eﬀect is noticeable in Fig. 5(b): the phase lag between
the maximum of p(φdr) and the signal maximum at φdr = π/2 increases upon
increasing the channel noise strength. In other words, the smaller membrane
patch ﬁres most probably more in advance than the larger patch, although the
probability distribution of the spikes occurrence is increasingly ﬂattened. This
prominent eﬀect can be explained as follows. The increase of noise strength
certainly helps to overcome the ﬁring threshold. Therefore, the system tends to
ﬁre more and more in advance, before the maximum of signal is reached. How-
ever, the noise increases also the uncertainty of ﬁring events and, therefore,
the probability distribution becomes ﬂat.

Even though the observed locking behavior presents clearly some sort of syn-
chronization, no perfect frequency synchronization – characterized by a per-
fect locking of the mean frequency (13) to the external driving frequency –
can be detected, see Fig. 5(a). While for large, but still sub-threshold stim-
uli A < Ath ≈ 2.1 µA/cm2 a plateau is formed over a wide range of noise
strengths, the mean frequency, which corresponds to this plateau, doesn’t
match the driving frequency. This frequency mismatch happens due to the
multimodal structure of ISIH, which is caused by the locking of the ﬁring oc-
currences to the external force period in ratios diﬀerent from 1 : 1. A similar
phenomenon of imperfect synchronization has also been found in the human
cardiorespiratory activity [6]. The plateau corresponds to the situation where
nearly every maximum of the driving force produces a spike. Nevertheless,
some driving maxima produce no spikes and therefore the mean frequency is
smaller than the driving frequency. We point out, however, that for a signal
represented by a stochastic spike train, like in Ref. [13], a perfect synchroniza-
tion should be observed. The reason is that a random driving with the mean
frequency hΩi will not produce additional maxima in the ISIH at the multi-
plies of the mean driving frequency. The occurrence of such maxima thereby
destroys the perfect synchronization in the periodic case.

The situation changes with a super-threshold stimuli, see dashed-dotted line
in Fig. 5(a): here the increasing strength of the channel noise with decreasing
size S destroys the perfect frequency synchronization. This is caused by the
skipping of some ﬁring events, or by the generation of additional spikes.

10

5 Conclusions

In conclusion, we have investigated the synchronization in a noisy general-
ization of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which incorporates the spontaneous
ﬂuctuations of the membrane conductivity due to the individual ion channel
dynamics – the so-called channel noise. In the absence of an externally ap-
plied stimulus the excitable membrane patch exhibits a noise-induced rhyth-
mic spiking activity at an optimal patch area. This eﬀect can be regarded as
the intrinsic coherence resonance [19,20]. In the presence of external periodic
driving, the interspike interval histograms clearly demonstrate a synchroniza-
tion of ﬁring events with the external driving for large and intermediate patch
sizes, while for small membrane patches the channel noise reigns the spik-
ing dynamics. Due to the excitation of higher harmonics, a perfect frequency
synchronization could not be observed. Instead, the Rice frequency, which is
deﬁned by the occurrence frequency of action potentials, exhibits a plateau-like
structure for subthreshold signals: over a rather wide range of channel noise
strength the Rice frequency can be ﬁxed at a value smaller than the driving
frequency. Furthermore, it was shown that the Hilbert frequency of the voltage
signal equals to the Rice frequency of the spike process and, therefore, this
average Rice frequency also reveals an imperfect synchronization behavior.

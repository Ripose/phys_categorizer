Abstract

Metabolic control analysis (Kacser & Burns (1973). Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 27, 65-104;
Heinrich & Rapoport (1974). Eur. J. Biochem. 42, 89-95) was developed for the under-
standing of multi-enzyme networks. At the core of this approach is the ﬂux summation
theorem. This theorem implies that there is an invariant relationship between the control
coefﬁcients of enzymes in a pathway. One of the main conclusions that has been derived
from the summation theorem is that phenotypic robustness to mutation ( e.g. dominance
) is an inherent property of metabolic systems and hence does not require an evolution-
ary explanation (Kacser & Burns (1981). Genetics. 97, 639-666; Porteous (1996). J.
theor. Biol. 182, 223-232 ). Here we show that for mutations involving discrete changes
( of any magnitude ) in enzyme concentration the ﬂux summation theorem does not hold.
The scenarios we examine are two-enzyme pathways with a diffusion barrier, two en-
zyme pathways that allow for enzyme saturation and two enzyme pathways that have
both saturable enzymes and a diffusion barrier. Our results are extendable to sequential
pathways with any number of enzymes. The fact that the ﬂux summation theorem cannot
hold in sequential pathways casts serious doubts on the claim that robustness with respect
to mutations is an inherent property of metabolic systems.

1. Introduction

How do changes in enzyme properties alter the physiological phenotype? Such knowl-
edge is a key component in understanding the relation between genotype and phenotype.
The two main approaches to this problem have developed into ﬁelds known as metabolic
control analysis ( MCA ) (Kacser & Burns, 1973; Heinrich & Rapoport, 1974; Kacser
et al., 1995) and biochemical systems theory ( BST ) (Savageau, 1976; Savageau & Sor-
ribas, 1989). Results from MCA have had extensive inﬂuence in biochemistry, genetics
and evolution ( for an overview see the entire issue of J. theor. Biol., 182:3 , 1996 ). The
cornerstone of the MCA approach is a theoretical result referred to as the ﬂux summa-
tion theorem. The biological interpretation of the summation theorem is that there are
systemic constraints inherent in metabolic pathways; these constraints limit the magni-
tude of the effects that changes in enzyme activity can have on ﬂux through a pathway.
The existence of such constraints has two implications. In the ﬁrst place, the summa-
tion theorem implies that in general the control of ﬂux in a pathway is shared between
enzymes. Hence rate limiting enzymes are rare (Kacser, 1995). Secondly, the theorem
implies that on the average, mutations that change enzyme concentrations will have a
small effect on ﬂux. This implication has important consequences in evolutionary theory
and genetics. It means that phenomena that fall under the rubric of phenotypic robust-
ness to mutations ( such as selective neutrality, canalization and dominance ) are inherent
properties of metabolic systems and are not a result of evolution. This MCA argument
was originally made in reference to the case of dominance, stating that dominance is an
inherent property of metabolic pathways and not a result of evolution (Kacser & Burns,
1981; Keightley, 1996; Porteous, 1996).

At the core of the MCA approach is a measure of the control exerted by each enzyme
on ﬂux through a pathway. The control coefﬁcient C J
i measures how important each
enzyme is in its ability to affect steady-state ﬂux via changes in enzyme concentration.
In its original formulation (Kacser & Burns, 1973) the control coefﬁcient was deﬁned as

C J

i =

δJ
J

/

δEi
Ei

,

(1)

where J is the steady state ﬂux of metabolites through the pathway (net rate of product
formation at the end of a pathway), Ei is the concentration of enzyme i, δEi is a discrete
change in enzyme concentration and δJ is the resultant change in ﬂux. Hence C J
is
i
basically a ratio of percentage change in a pathway’s steady state ﬂux to the corresponding
percentage change in enzyme concentration.

Theoretical results that contradict or object to different conclusions derived within
MCA have been posed several times (Cornish-Bowden, 1987; Giersch, 1988; Savageau
& Sorribas, 1989; Savageau, 1992; Grossniklaus et al., 1996; Kholodenko et al., 1998).
In each case the possible misrepresentation of non-linearities in MCA has appeared in
a different guise. In the ﬁrst place, Cornish-Bowden (1987) showed that in a sequential
pathway if the maximal rate Vmax of consecutive enzymes are sequentially decreasing
then dominance is not a necessary property of the pathway. Hence the possibility exists

3

that dominance can evolve. This objection was rejected in MCA on grounds that the
speciﬁc arrangement of kinetic values suggested is a special case that is very unlikely
to occur by chance (Kacser, 1987). A second set of objections was then put forth by
Savageau and Sorribas (1989, 1992). They argued that in pathways exhibiting non-linear
behavior that arises from properties such as enzyme-enzyme interactions, feedback loops
or non-sequential pathway structure it can be shown that dominance is not inherent to the
pathway. Based on disagreements on the mathematical models used, this second objec-
tion was rejected by MCA proponents (Kacser, 1991; Kacser, 1995). Nevertheless more
recent work indirectly corroborates this objection (Grossniklaus et al., 1996; Kholodenko
et al., 1998).

The present paper deals with problems involving the biological in-applicability of
MCA precepts. We show that for discrete changes ( of any magnitude ) in enzyme con-
centration, the ﬂux summation theorem does not hold. This means that contrary to the
MCA allegations, there are no a-priori constraints that would require the magnitude of
mutational effects to be small. Furthermore these results re-open the possibility that
phenotypic robustness to mutations ( e.g. dominance ) is not an inherent property of
metabolic pathways and can be a result of evolution.

Our conclusions do not necessarily imply that the summation theorem is inherently
false as an isolated mathematical proposition. Rather that it has been applied to the wrong
context. This erroneous application arises due to two main disparities. In the ﬁrst place,
the argument for the summation theorem in the original Kacser and Burns paper (1973)
is derived using a discrete formulation. However, in most subsequent work ( e.g. Kacser
& Burns 1981 ) a continous formulation of the theorem is used. Hence the discrete proof
for the summation theorem does not correspond to the continous form in which it is
frequently used. In the second place, mutations necessarily involve discrete changes in
enzyme activity. Hence, whether a continous version of the summation theorem holds or
not ( which it would in cases where the ﬂux function is homogenous, see Giersch 1988 )
does not say anything about whether a pathway will be robust or exhibit dominance with
respect to discrete changes. In order for a pathway to be robust with respect to discrete
changes, the discrete version of the summation theorem has to hold. In this paper we
show that for dicrete changes of any size the discrete version does not hold, and hence
that robustness is not an inherent property of a metabolic pathway.

The matter addressed here has been a subject of debate for thirty years. In order to be
clear about the objects that we treat and the mathematical properites that pertain to them a
rigorous approach to the problem was necessary. The main assumptions and implications
we derived are summarized as follows:

INITIAL ASSUMPTION

Assumption 0. The metabolic pathways studied are two-enzyme pathways. They have

one input and one output and can reach a steady state ﬂux.

4

CASE A : DIFFUSION LIMITED PATHWAYS

Assumption 1. Maximal rate of input into the metabolic pathway is limited by a diffu-

sion process.

Implication 1. The ﬂux summation theorem does not hold.

CASE B : SEQUENTIAL PATHWAYS THAT ALLOW FOR ENZYME SATURATION

Assumption 1. The two enzymes are near saturation.

Implication 1. The ﬂux summation theorem does not hold.

CASE C : NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF PATHWAYS WITH REVERSIBLE MICHAELIS-
MENTEN KINETICS

Assumption 1. Each enzyme in the pathway behaves according to reversible Michaelis-
Menten enzyme kinetics. Isolated Michaelis-Menten enzymes do allow for enzyme
saturation. Note that such kinetics are manifest in empirical studies of isolated
enzymes in vitro.

Assumption 2. When Michaelis-Menten enzymes are placed in the context of a multi-
enzyme pathway, their kinetic mechanisms do not change. This is a pure assump-
tion.

Assumption 3. Maximal rate of input into the metabolic pathway is limited by a dif-
fusion process. As in assumption 1, this is is an assumption that is empirically
justiﬁed (Tralau et al., 2000).

Numerical Result 1. In regimes where both enzymes are saturated the summation theo-

rem does not hold.

Numerical Result 2. In regimes where ﬂux is near the diffusion limited rate, the sum-

mation theorem does not hold.

Assumption 4. Mutations can cause heritable variation in the catalytic turnover rate kcat

of an enzyme.

5

Numerical Result 3. The control of a pathway can be switched from one enzyme to
another via mutations affecting kcat. Each enzyme can be the sole controlling
enzyme of a pathway.

The main reason for the restricted applicability of the summation theorem is the fact
that for its construction the non-linear interaction effects on ﬂux were ignored. It is pre-
cisely the interaction effects between enzymes that lead to the manifestation of interaction
effects ( epistasis ). Furthermore it is the interposition of the non-linear properties of en-
zymes that allow for the evolution of control.

2. Mathematical Introduction

2.1. The conception of control in MCA

Upon devising MCA, as Kacser and Burns put it, it was necessary to place the understand-
ing of individual enzyme behavior into the context of a “metabolic society” composed of
several enzymes (Kacser & Burns, 1979). In accordance to this goal, one of the objec-
tives of metabolic control analysis was to ascertain what role each enzyme could play in
affecting steady state ﬂux in a particular metabolic pathway. Speciﬁcally, how important
each enzyme is in its ability to affect steady state ﬂux via the regulation of the enzyme
concentration. Hence the use of the control coefﬁcient as C J
non-dimensionalized sensitivity measure that shows the ratio of proportional change in
ﬂux to proportional change in enzyme concentration.

2.2. The ﬂux summation theorem

One of the central tenets of metabolic control theory has been that the sum of the control
coefﬁcients in a pathway with n enzymes equals one. That is,

Equation (2) is commonly referred to as the ﬂux summation theorem and was derived by
Kacser and Burns using the following form of reasoning:

Given an unbranched chain of n enzyme catalyzed reactions, if we were to increase
the concentration Ei of enzyme i by the proportional ratio δEi/Ei, the change in ﬂux due
to enzyme i would be given by rearranging (1) to give:

For all enzymes i :

If δEi/Ei = α , where α is a constant, one could consider the case where all enzyme
concentrations are changed by the constant proportion α. In such a case Kacser and Burns

3. Construction of two-enzyme pathway models

3.1. Two-enzyme pathways as dynamical systems

A general dynamical model of multi-enzyme systems can be formulated based on the
classical model of single-substrate enzyme catalysis. Under such a scheme the existence
of an intermediate enzyme-substrate complex is posited and a set of forward and back-
ward reaction rates is attributed to each transformation. Consider a pathway in which an
outside substrate u diffuses into the initial reaction compartment,where the substrate is
fed into a two reaction pathway that comprises two successive enzyme catalyzed reac-
tions. An irreversible sink step is added to the end of the reaction sequence in order to
remove the product.

where (es1) and (es2) are the enzyme-substrate complexes, while e1 and e2 are the ﬁrst
and second enzymes catalyzing the two respective reactions. The input and output cor-
respond to u and o respectively. The kinetic model (9) is a class of model that can be
represented as a system of autonomous differential equations with input u(t) and initial
conditions s(0) and e(0) such that;

where at time t, the vector s(t) = h s1(t), s2(t), s3(t) i is the state vector of substrate con-
centrations, the vector e(t) = h e1(t), es1(t), e2(t), es2(t) i is the state vector of enzyme

˙s(t) = f1[ s(t), e(t), u(t) ]
˙e(t) = f2[ s(t), e(t) ]
˙o(t) = f3[ s3(t) ]

and enzyme-substrate complex concentrations, the variable o(t) is the concentration as-
sociated with the output variable and ˙o(t) is the output ﬂux. The notation ˙x associated
with any variable x denotes the time derivative dx/dt. If the system reaches a steady
state ﬂux the output ﬂux ˙o(t) is equivalent to the steady state ﬂux J used in the MCA
literature.

3.2. Characterization of two-enzyme pathways into distinct classes

We will make the rest of our argument using a set theroetic framework. For any given set,
if we can deﬁne the general properties of its members, then any object which is deemed to
be a member of that set will also have those properties. A system of equations is a logical
proposition. As such we can cast our dynamical system model in a set theoretic guise. A
pathway p is an object. Each object has a series of properties K associated with it, such
that K⌊p⌋ = True. The properties K delineate the context and system of equations that
can describe a pathway ( For alternative representations see Fontana & Buss 1996 ). Each
pathway p can then be treated as an element of a set with distinct properites.

Deﬁnition 1 : P1,1 ≡ Set of two enzyme pathways with one input and one output.

There are no strict stipulations on the stoichiometry nor on the speciﬁcs of enzyme kinetic
mechanisms for membership in P1,1 ( see Appendix A ).

Deﬁnition 2: Pu,J ≡ Set of two-enzyme pathways with constant input and steady-state
ﬂux

The set Pu,J is deﬁned as the subset Pu,J ⊂ P1,1 such that p ∈ Pu,J if and only if the
following four conditions hold:

1. p ∈ P1,1

2. Irrespective of the enzyme kinetic mechanisms, p has the stoichiometry of a two-

enzyme sequential pathway as exhibited in model (9).

3. When driven by a constant input u, p exhibits a unique steady state output ﬂux J ∗
that can be associated with each pair of total enzyme concentrations hE1, E2i.

4. For any error margin ε > 0, the steady state output ﬂux J ∗ can be approximated by
using the total enzyme concentrations hE1, E2i and constant input u as arguments
for a computable function gε such that J = gε[u, E1, E2] and |J − J ∗| < ε .

Items 2 to 4 are elaborated more precisely in Deﬁnitions 2.2 to 2.4 in Appendix A.
Note that the MCA approach holds informal versions of these propositions as premises,
without which talking about the steady-state ﬂux J and the summation theorem would
not be possible.

9

Deﬁnition 3: PuD,J ≡ Set of diffusion limited two-enzyme pathways with steady-state
ﬂux

The set PuD,J is deﬁned as the subset PuD,J ⊂ Pu,J such that p ∈ PuD,J if and only if
the following two conditions hold:

1. p ∈ Pu,J

2. The net input ﬂux from u(t) into the system is governed by a diffusion-limited pro-
cess such that N etstartf lux = D ( u(t) − s1(t) ) where D is a diffusion constant.

Item 2 is more precisely deﬁned in deﬁnition 3.2 in Appendix A.

Deﬁnition 4: Pu,Vmax,J ≡ Set of two-enzyme pathways with steady-state ﬂux and kinet-
ics that allows for enzyme saturation.

The set Pu,Vmax,J is deﬁned as the subset Pu,Vmax,J ⊂ Pu,J such that p ∈ Pu,Vmax,J
if and only if the following two conditions hold:

1. p ∈ Pu,J

2. For every enzyme i, there exists a constant kcat(i) ≥ 0 such that for all values of

Ei ≥ 0 the steady state ﬂux is consistent with the relation J ≤ Ei kcat(i).

Item 2 is more precisely deﬁned in deﬁnition 4.2 in Appendix A.

Deﬁnition 5: PuD,Vmax,J ≡ Set of diffusion limited two-enzyme pathways with steady-
state ﬂux and kinetics that allows for enzyme saturation.

The set PuD,Vmax,J is deﬁned as the intersection

PuD,Vmax,J = (PuD,J ∩ Pu,Vmax,J) ⊂ Pu,J.

As an intuitive guide, the order of the generality of the representations discussed
so far, in order of higher generality are: PuD,Vmax,J ⊂ PuD,J ⊂ Pu,J ⊂ P1,1 and
PuD,Vmax,J ⊂ Pu,Vmax,J ⊂ Pu,J ⊂ P1,1 (See Figure 1).

10

4. Problems with the summation theroem

The deﬁnitions from the previous section have a series of logical implications. Here we
present these implications and explain their signiﬁcance. The proofs for these proposi-
tions are given in Appendix B.

4.1. Pathways with a constant input and a steady-state ﬂux (Pu,J)

Proposition 11

For any pathway of class Pu,J, the ﬂux summation theorem implies that for any given
ratio of enzymes 0 ≤ (E1/E2) ≤ ∞ , there exists a Cθ such that ﬂux is a linear function
of the magnitude of the vector hE1, E2i.

(∀p ∈ Pu,J) : (∀θ | tan θ = E1/E2) : (∃Cθ) :
.

2 = 1 ⇒ J = khE1, E2ik Cθ

1 + C J

C J

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(11)

The meaning of proposition 11 is very simple. If a pathway were to be of class Pu,J
and were to obey the ﬂux summation theorem the following would hold: the ﬂux would
behave in a linear fashion with respect to tandem changes in which both enzyme concen-
trations are changed by the same percentage. It is a short few steps (Appendix B) to show
that

∀

α =

δE1

E2 (cid:19)

:

δJ
J

(cid:20)

= α ⇔ J = khE1, E2ik Cθ

.

(12)

(cid:21)

Proposition (12) is equivalent to a statement of homogeneity ( See Giersch 1988 ), such
that if J = g[E1, E2] then

g[ (1 + α)E1, (1 + α)E2 ] = (1 + α)g[ E1, E2 ].

(13)

For example consider two enzymes whose genes are located on the same operon. In
addition consider the case in which such a cell is in a state in which the concentrations of
the two enzymes are initially negligible. When the operon is turned on, each enzyme will
have a particular rate of expression. If the ratio between those rates of expression remains
constant, then the ﬂux summation theorem would imply that the ﬂux would increase
linearly without reaching a saturation plateau. This is what J = khE1, E2ik Cθ implies,
2 . Hence, in a pathway of class Pu,J, in which we have
where khE1, E2ik =
made no assertion about the particulars of the enzyme-kinetic equations or parameters,
the ﬂux summation theorem assumes a particular type of dynamic behavior. A ﬂux that
increases linearly without saturation is a very special case and such a condition can only
hold in a restricted subset of Pu,J.
In fact, as proposition 14 will attest, even for a
simple pathway with the sole kinetic imposition of a diffusion barrier, the ﬂux summation
theorem fails.

4.2. Pathways with a diffusion barrier (PuD,J)

Proposition 14

For any pathway of class PuD,J, the ﬂux summation theorem is false.

(cid:3) (cid:3)

Proposition 14 basically states the general result that any pathway which has a diffusion
barrier at a point before its ﬁrst step will not obey the summation theorem. This includes
almost any metabolic pathway that takes place in the conﬁnes of a cell. In fact it can be
shown that any pathway that exhibits a plateauing effect on its ﬂux surface will not obey
the summation theorem. The proof of this theorem is intuitively simple (Appendix B). It
is basically dependent on the conditional relation

C J

1 + C J

2 = 1 ⇒ J = khE1, E2ik Cθ

(15)

from (11). For any pathway class that is a subset of Pu,J, if the pathways do not obey the
right hand side of 15 then they do not obey the left hand side either. For PuD,J one can
show that J = khE1, E2ik Cθ does not hold when Cθ > 0. This is because the diffusion
barrier will impede ﬂux from increasing indeﬁnitley. This implies that
i = 1
cannot be true for all enzyme concentrations. This falsehood applies to all diffusion-
limited ﬂux surfaces except for a disfunctional cell with ﬂux surface J = 0. Proposition
14 is due to the fact that control is not only dependent on the enzymatic steps in a pathway,
but also the diffusion steps.

4.3. Pathways that allow for enzyme saturation (Pu,Vmax,J)

Proposition 16

For any pathway of class Pu,Vmax,J, if both enzymes approach saturation and changes in
enzyme concentration are positive, then the sum of control coefﬁcients approaches zero.

(cid:21)

Whenever two enzymes are near saturation, a situation is created whereupon the ﬂux ef-
fects of increasing the concentration for one enzyme is restrained by the other enzyme.
Hence whenever two enzymes approach saturation simultaneously, the sum of their con-
trol coefﬁcients approaches zero and the ﬂux summation theorem does not hold ( see
appendix B ). In fact it is not too difﬁcult to extend the proof such that for a sequential
pathway of any length, the sum of all control coefﬁcients will approach zero whenever
any two enzymes approach saturation.

12

Proposition 17

For any pathway of class Pu,Vmax,J in which a decrease in enzyme concentration in-
creases saturation, if both enzymes approach saturation and changes in enzyme concen-
tration are negative, then the sum of control coefﬁcients approaches two.

For all intervals ai < Ei < bi:
If p ∈ Pu,Vmax,J and ∀i : ( ∂Sati

Ei ≥ 0 and ai ≥ 0 and δEi < 0 )

then:

(cid:1)

(17)

In such situations the pathway is no longer robust to decreases in enzyme concentration.
Hence dominance is not an inherent property of these pathways. It is simple to extend
this result to sequential pathways of any length, in which the sum of control coefﬁcients
will approach the the number of enzymes which are approaching saturation.

From propositions 14, 16 and 16 it also follows that the summation theorem is also

false in pathways of class PuD,Vmax,J.

4.5. Enzyme interactions in Pu,J

The motivation for analyzing multi-enzyme pathways is that they behave differently from
single-enzymes. The natural question is to ask what are the direct or indirect interactions
between enzymes that lead to the difference between single-enzyme and multi-enzyme
pathway behavior. Interaction does not necessarily have to signify direct physical interac-
tion between two enzymes. It can occur via the effect of one enzyme on the concentration
of pathway intermediates that in turn physically interact with another enzyme. In equa-
tion (6) which was one of the assumptions that Kacser and Burns made in deriving the
summation theorem, the proposition δJ
i amounts to an assumption that
enzymes do not exhibit interactions. Here interaction is speciﬁcally referring to the mu-
tual effect that the two enzymes would have on each-other’s ability to affect pathway
ﬂux:

The assumption of independence of effects is something that surreptitiously goes against

13

the motivation for developing MCA. Nonetheless the assumption of no enzyme interac-
tions is built into the summation theorem from the beginning. In fact:

Proposition 19

For any pathway of class Pu,J, the summation theorem implies that the change in ﬂux
due to change of total enzyme concentration at one locus is independent of total enzyme
concentration at the second locus in the pathway.

Proposition 21

For any pathway of class Pu,J, the summation theorem holds if and only if ﬂux is a linear
function of enzyme concentrations.

In short, the summation theorem imposes conditions on enzyme interactions that are

neither explicitly argued for nor conceptually justiﬁed.

5. Numerical analysis of a pathway of class PuD,Vmax,J

Here we use numerical simulations for a particular case in order to verify the analytical
results from the previous section. Consider a case where the enzymes exhibit reversible
Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A diffusion barrier is included at the beginning of the path-
way. During the interval of analysis 0 ≤ t ≤ tf , the input remains constant such that
˙¯u(t) = 0 (e.g. approximation of large nutrient pool and/or steady state conditions of
a chemostat). In such a case the full form of the system of differential equations (10)
combined with the kinetic model (9) are:

where the postﬁx (t) for each state variable is omitted.

The system of differential equations (22) will serve as the basis for the examination
of a particular case. For the present analysis we are interested in the steady states of the
dynamical system. At steady state, as deﬁned in appendix A, the derivatives ˙s(t) and ˙e(t)
are equal to zero. Consider a case where the equations in (22) serve as the basis for the
functions f1, f2 and f3 with the stoichiometric constraint that

[E1] = [e1] + [es1]
[E2] = [e2] + [es2].

(23)

In such a case, the steady state solution can be obtained in an implicit form ( See appendix
C ). The implicit equations can then be solved numerically by Newton-Raphson based
algorithms that converge to the ﬂux surface shown in Figure 2. On a cursory level the
surface shows the plateau effect familiar in most models of two-enzyme pathways. The
plateau arises due to the limiting effects of the diffusion barrier. We will refer to the
pathway based on equations (22) as pathway p22. It is not difﬁcult to discern that pathway
p22 is a member of the set PuD,Vmax,J. It satisﬁes the conditions required in deﬁnitions
1 to 5.

5.1. Test of the summation theorem

Given the ﬂux surface on p22 ∈ PuD,Vmax,J, the ﬂux summation theorem can be tested
i for
directly. Figures 3 and 4 show surfaces for for discrete versions of the sum

p22. It is evident from these examples that in the pathway p22 there is no evidence of
an invariant relation in which the control coefﬁcients sum to the predetermined value of
one. Figures 3 and 4 serve as illustrations of propositions 14, 16 and 17. The summation
theorem fails in the regimes where ﬂux is near its diffusion-limited maximal rate or in
areas where both enzymes are near saturation. The regions where both enzymes approach
saturation are shown in Figure 5.

5.2. Epistatic interactions between enzymes

The question of the extent to which enzymes have interactive effects on ﬂux can also be
addressed directly using the pathway p22 as an example. In Figure 6 the mixed partial
difference δ2J /δE1δE2 is used as a measure of epistatic interactions between enzymes
(proposition 18). Note that the region where the epistatic interactions increase coincides
with a region where the summation theorem fails and both enzymes are approaching
saturation.

5.3. Rate limiting enzymes and the switching of control between enzymes

One of the claims from MCA has been that there is no such thing as a rate limiting
enzyme in a pathway. The associated claim is that control is mostly shared between
enzymes in a pathway (Kacser, 1995). The results of our numerical simulations of p22
do not support this claim. Figure 7 shows the numerical results for two pathways with
different kcat conﬁgurations. In the range of concentration regimes hE1, E2i examined,
most regimes manifest a sole enzyme as the controlling enzyme for a given pathway. In
regimes where ﬂux is near the diffusion limited maximal ﬂux, no enzyme has control. The
only region where the enzymes share control is where the summation theorem fails. In
i = 1 is basically
fact in the regions that the summation theorem holds, the sum
the value C J
z for the sole controlling enzyme z at that regime. Furthermore the identity of
the controlling enzyme at a given regime is not invariant. The identity of the controlling
enzyme can change by changing the kcat values of the enzymes involved (e.g. by mutation
). In Figure 7 the switch in control is clearly apparent by comparing the values of C J
2
between the two kcat conﬁgurations.

6. Discussion and conclusion

The main intent of the present paper has been to present an analysis and critique of some
of the main biological conclusions derived from MCA. Our results strongly support ini-
tial objections that were made with regards to the MCA perspective on the biochemical
nature of dominance ( Cornish-Bowden 1987, Savageau 1992. See also Mayo & Burger
1997 ). At the core of the problem of multienzyme systems is interaction effects between
enzymes. In order to address these interactions, the non-linear properties of enzyme catal-
ysis cannot be ignored. These non-linear interactions play a major role in the phenotypic
characteristics of metabolic physiology. Our analysis shows that for discrete changes of

16

any magnitude, the ﬂux summation theorem does not hold. This means that there are no
a-priori constraints that would require the magnitude of mutational effects to be in a low
range. This leaves open the possibility for two phenomena which had been previously
rejected in MCA. In the ﬁrst place, rate limiting steps or controlling enzymes do not have
to be rare, and their identity can change by evolution. Secondly, phenotypic robustness
with respect to mutations is not an automatic property of metabolic pathways; the de-
gree of robustness can be modiﬁed through the evolution of kinetic properties. These are
implications that we will examine in a later work.

that for a given set of initial conditions, the concentrations E1 and E2 are to be deter-
mined at any time t by summing the free-enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex concen-
trations for each enzyme respectively. The variable ξ(t) needs some explanation. ξ(t)
determines the “stoichiometric content” of the pathway in the sense that the coefﬁcients
ci in the equation

ξ(t) = c1s1(t) + c2es1(t) + c3s2(t) + c4es2(t) + c5s3(t) + c6e1(t) + c7e2(t)

are determined by whether in reference to the input molecule, the transformations leading
to the macro-molecules associated with each coefﬁcient are fusions, cleavages or one-one
transformations. The values of the ci in (25) correspond to the kinetic model (9). The
equation for ˙ξ(t) also deserves attention. Each metabolic pathway can be characterized
such that ˙ξ(t) is determined by the additive combination of two values at time t:

˙ξ(t) = Netstartﬂux(t) - Netendﬂux(t)

which in turn can be subdivided as

Netstartﬂux(t) = Iin(t) − Irev(t)
Netendﬂux(t) =Oout(t) − Orev(t)

and

where Iin(t) is the ﬂux entering the system from the input variable u(t), Irev(t) is the
ﬂux exiting the system and going back into u(t), Oout(t) is the ﬂux exiting the system
into the output variable o(t) and Orev(t) is the ﬂux entering back into the system from
o(t). For a kinetic model with an irreversible sink step, Orev(t) = 0. For a system
where the output variable o(t) is only driven by a single pathway p, Oout(t) = ˙o(t).
Finally for Pu,J the only stipulations made for the two components of Netstartﬂux(t)
is that they must both be greater or equal to zero such that Iin(t), Irev(t) ∈ R1
≥0 and
Netstartﬂux(t) = Iin(t) − Irev(t).

Deﬁnition 2.4

The proposition (“computable: hE1, E2, ui 7→ J ”)⌊p⌋ states that an approximation J of
J ∗ is computable as a function of the initial input and total enzyme concentrations:

(“computable: hE1, E2, ui 7→ J ”)⌊p⌋ ≡

(cid:1)

The above deﬁnition means that for any error margin ε ≥ 0, there exists at-least one
effectively computable function gε that maps to the approximate value J by using the
total enzyme concentrations and initial input as arguments. Note that gε as an effectively
computable function refers to both numerical and analytic functions that can produce an
approximation J. The assumption of computability is associated with the assumption
that there is a rule based mechanistic relation between E1, E2 and u. There is a strong
assumption inherent in the deﬁnitions of gε in Pu,J: that for any pathway p ∈ Pu,J a
steady state ﬂux exists and can be determined using only u(0), E1 and E2 as arguments.
That is, except for the constraints imposed by u(0), E1 and E2 the steady state is indepen-
dent of the speciﬁcs of starting conditions. Note that for classes of pathways that exhibit
multiple equilibria the trajectories become important and all the starting conditions have
to be included as arguments in a newly deﬁned computable function other than gε, which
would be embedded in a system other than Pu,J.

On the other hand consider a diffusion-limited pathway p2 ∈ PuD,J where J = g[E1, E2]
as deﬁned by (61). When the system reaches a steady state as deﬁned by (26), we know
by (25) that ˙ξ(t) = 0 and 0 = Iin(t) − Irev(t) − ˙o(t). Since lim
˙o(t) = J ∗, using (28)
t→∞
we have the steady state condition:

J ∗ = D u(t) − D s1(t)
J ± ε = D u(t) − Ds1(t).

and

Since ˙u(t) = 0;

(∀p2 ∈ PuD,J) : (∃D) : (∀u(0) = c2) : (∀ε) :
[ c3 = D c2 ] ∧ [ J ± ε = c3 − Ds1(t) ].

Recall that D ≥ 0 by (28) and s1(t) ≥ 0 by (24). For any ﬁnite 0 < ε < ∞ we can
deﬁne a constant c4 such that c4 = c3 + ε. Consequently

B.5 Proof of proposition 18

The most straight forward proof of (18) is by direct deduction. To do this we deﬁne a
set of notations for representing discrete changes in steady state ﬂux due to changes in
enzyme concentration.

Deﬁnition B.4a:

For a given input u(t) that is constant, let J be the abbreviated notation for the result of a
mapping in a function g : R2 7→ R1, with the variables E1 and E2 as arguments:

(∀p ∈ Pu,J) :
(∀u(0) ∈ R1) : (∀(ε > 0) ∈ R1
[ J = g[E1, E2] ⇔ J = gε[u(0), E1, E2] ]

≥0) : (∃g : R2

≥0 7→ R1) :

(61)

The discrete operator ( )

E1E2
7−→ applied to J is deﬁned as:

E1E2
7−→ ≡ g[E1 + δE1 , E2 + δE2]

J

where the symbol “≡” denotes identity by deﬁnition and for a given function g, the incre-
ments in E1 and E2 are held constant such that δE1 = c1, δE2 = c2 and c1, c2 ∈ R1
≥0.
Similarly,

E1
7−→ ≡ g[E1 + δE1 , E2]

J

and J

E2
7−→ ≡ g[E1 , E2 + δE2].

Note that the operator ( )

(cid:4) proposition 21

C. Derivations for Numerical Analysis

Derivations for ﬂux surfaces

At steady state the algebraic solution for the state variables of the equations in (22) can
be obtained using algebraic solving routines. The solution for the seven internal state

29

variables are in the form of ﬁve equations in which there are no explicit solutions for e1
and e2 such that:

s1 = (e2Q(k2 + k3)k5k7 + e1k2k4(Q(k6 + k7) + e2k6k8)) Θ

es1 = e1k1(e2Qk5k7 + e1k4(Q(k6 + k7) + e2k6k8)) Θ

s2 = e1k1k3(Q(k6 + k7) + e2k6k8) Θ

(81)

es2 = e1e2k1k3k5(Q + e2k8) Θ

s3 = e1e2k1k3k5k7 Θ

where

Θ =

uD
e2Q(k2 + k3)k5k7D + e1(Qk2k4(k6 + k7)D + e2(Qk1k3k5k7 + k2k4k6k8D))

.

(82)

(83)

In addition recall the stoichiometric constraint that

E1 = e1 + es1
E2 = e2 + es2.

Taking the equations (81), (82) and (83) we have a system of seven equations. These
can be solved by a convergent Newton-Raphson based numerical algorithm for any case
where the set of real-valued parameters

{D, E1, E2, Q, k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6, k7, k8}

is given. The solution for {s1, s2, s3, e1, es1, e2, es2} that is arrived at by numerical ap-
proximation can then be used to solve for the steady state ﬂux J. The surfaces in Figure
2 and Figure 7 are numerical solutions of (81), (82) and (83).

The wild-type kinetic parameters used in the numerical procedures were k1 = k5 =
4 × 107M −1sec−1 , k2 = k6 = 4 × 102sec−1, k3 = k7 = 7 × 102sec−1 and k4 = k8 =
1 × 106M −1sec−1. The diffusion constants used are D = Q = 3 × 101sec−1. For each
enzyme Keq = 70 and for the wild type kcat = 42, 000min−1. Figures 8 and 9 show the
steady state solution of all state variables in the pathway p22.

For simulations of mutations affecting kcat consider enzyme 1 as an example. Kinetic
mutations have to occur under the thermodynamic constraint that the equilibrium constant
Keq = k1k3/k2k4 for the reaction cannot change. Note that Vmax = kcat [Ei] = k3 [E1].
For instance a reduction of kcat to 25% of wild type can be modelled by multiplying each
of the wild-type rate constants k3 and k4 by 1/4.

Failure of a modiﬁed summation conjecture

A possible counter to the failure of the summation theorem is to try to include all steps in
a pathway, including the non-enzymatic diffusion steps. Hence a conjecture that

C J

i = C J

D + C J

E1 + C J

E1 + C J
Q

(84)

n

i=1
X

Here we show the numerical evidence that such a conjecture does not hold in p22. In any
case if such a conjecture had been true, it would not have been of much practical value
since it would mean that for any pathway deep in metabolism one would have had to
take into account every step starting from the initial diffusion barrier. A modiﬁcation of
the proof for proposition (16) can be used to show the failure of the modiﬁed summation
conjecture in regions of saturation. In Figure 10 we show the numerical failure of the
modiﬁed summation conjecture for a case where δEi = 0.02µM and δD/D = δQ/Q =
0.01.

We introduce a general method for cerebral cortical map generation and apply it to pattern for-
mation in orientation and ocular dominance columns of the brain. From a known cortical structure,
we build spin Hamiltonian models with long-range interactions of the Mexican hat type. These
Hamiltonian models allow a coherent interpretation of the diverse phenomena in the map formation
in the visual cortex with the help of relaxation dynamics of spins. In particular, we predict vari-
ous phenomena of self-organization in orientation and ocular map formation including the pinwheel
annihilation and its dependency on the columnar wave vector and boundary conditions.

A series of experiments suggest that important ele-
ments of the organization of ocular dominance (OD) and
orientation preference (OP) maps in the striate cortex
are not prespeciﬁed but emergent during an activity-
driven, self-organizing process [1, 2, 3, 4]. An optical
imaging technique [5, 6, 7] revealed the detailed maps
of OD and OP over small patches of the cortex, which
prompted several methods for the map generation and
various attempts for the analysis of the properties of the
emerging patterns [8]. In this paper, we propose a non-
competitive Hebbian model, called the ﬁbre bundle map
(FBM) method, which is closely related to problems in
statistical mechanics. The map formation of OP and OD
columns are explained with the help of the simple spin
Hamiltonians using this method. The statistical analysis
of these spin Hamiltonians leads to the successful predic-
tion of several properties of self-organized patterns that
have been observed in experiments and numerical simu-
lations.

In the OP columnar patterns, there are two prominent
experimentally observed features: (1) singular points (so
called “pinwheels”) are point-like discontinuities around
which the orientation preference changes by multiples of
180◦ along a closed loop, and (2) linear zones are regions
where iso-orientation domains (IODs) are straight and
run in parallel for a considerable distance [9, 10, 11]. In
the analysis of competitive Hebbian models [12, 13], the
bifurcation points between homogeneous and inhomoge-
neous solutions and the change of the wavelength Λ in
OP or OD columns are predicted [14, 15, 16]. Such lin-
ear zones in the OP pattern or the OD segregations are
the major features of inhomogeneous states. Some ex-
perimental or simulational results suggest that pinwheels
are not permanent structures but can be annihilated in
the course of active-dependent development [17]. The
perpendicular tendency of IODs and bands of OD with
the margin of the striate cortex is also reported [18, 19].
There are some evidence that OP and OD columns are

not independent but correlated. Pinwheels have a ten-
dency to align with the centers of OD bands and IODs
intersect the borders of OD bands at a steep angle [18].
The inﬂuence of the interactions between OP and OD
columns on the pinwheel stability was also predicted [17].

In our spin analogy, the progress in the visual map
formation corresponds to the relaxation dynamics of the
classical spin models, where the pinwheels in orientation
maps can be regarded as spin vortices. In this context,
the pinwheel unstability and its annihilation rate can be
predicted from the free energy of the topological excita-
tion or the Kosterlitz and Thouless transition temper-
ature. We will show that there is a bifurcation point
between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous states de-
pending on the strength of the relative inhibitory activity
k in lateral currents in the cortex. It is similar to the role
of the cooperation range σ in competitive Hebbian mod-
els [14, 15, 16]. Our model allows the calculation of the
columnar wavelength and the correlation function. The
extension of our model to the O(3) or the Heisenberg
model allows the correlation between the OP and OD
columns, which predicts the orthogonal property between
IODs and the borders of OD bands, and the inﬂuence of
strong OD segregations on the pinwheel stability. An-
other orthogonal property of patterns in area boundaries
can be derived from the equilibrium condition.

The six layers in the neocortex can be classiﬁed into
three diﬀerent functional types. The layer IV neurons
ﬁrst get the long range input signals and send them up
vertically to layer II and III that are called the true asso-
ciation cortex. Output signals are sent down to the layer
V and VI, and sent further to the thalamus or other deep
and distant neural structures. Horizontal connections
also happen in the superﬁcial (layer II and III) pyra-
midal neurons and have usual antagonistic propensity
which sharpens responsiveness to an area. However, the
superﬁcial pyramidal neurons also send excitatory recur-
rent to adjacent neurons due to unmyelinated collaterals.

Horizontal or lateral connections have such distance de-
pendent (so called ”Mexican hat” shaped) excitatory or
inhibitory activity. Some bunches of neurons also make
columnar clusters called minicolumns and such aggrega-
tions are needed considering more faculty or higher di-
mensional property of processing elements [21, 22].

Now our FBM model starts from the assumption that
the total space E is composed by lattice (or base) space B
and pattern (or ﬁbre) space F , and the pattern space does
not take part in the decision of “stimulus receptor (which
means the winner neuron in Kohonen’s self-organizing
feature map method [23])” diﬀerenting with the lattice
space. There needs also a transition function group G
(called a structure group) of a homeomorphism of the
ﬁbre space F to describe what happens if “excitatory”
or “inhibitory” activate each other. Sometimes the ﬁbre
group F is replaced by the structure group G, which de-
serves to be called symmetry (or gauge) group. If there is
no anisotropic connections, the pattern formation will be
determined just by neighborhood interactions and ran-
dom external stimuli.

Now in the case of OP map formation, the patterns are
deﬁned by the phase angles φi (0 ≤ φi < π). If there are
driven force by horizontal currents and external stimuli,
the changes of phases are described such that

for k > kc (Fig. 1). This means that there is a thresh-
old depending on kc below which linear zones in OP
columns or OD segregation are absent. Above the bi-
furcation point, linear zones or OD bands emerge with
the wavelength Λ = 2π/q∗, which decreases as k increases
(Fig. 2 (b) & (c)).

For the moment, the thermal eﬀect or the interactions
with OD columns are not considered. In this case, pin-
wheel structures cannot avoid the destiny of annihilation
due to the diagonalized Hamiltonian in momentum space.
In the evolutions of the OP map starting from a random
state by Eq. (1), dense pinwheels ﬁrst emerge with the
spin-waves for k < kc (Fig. 2 (a)) as for the classical XY
model. Then pinwheels start to annihilate in pairs and
eventually the map approaches a homogeneous state. For
k > kc (Fig. 2 (b)&(c)), pinwheels emerge with the plane-
waves (linear zones) and are annihilated in time as well.
The OP map will eventually approach the equilibrium
state that is composed of a uni-directional plane-wave,
the winner in the competition among |~q| = q∗ states.

a4 (4k −
1) exp(−2+1/2k) for k > kc), and both Js and Jp are pos-
itive for all k. The second term in Eq. (7) describes the
low energy excitation by pinwheel formation. Here, the
term with q∗ for plane-wave solutions do not contribute
in the pinwheel formation energy since ∇ × ∇φpw = 0
and the line integral around any contour vanish also by
Stoke’s theorem. Just adapting the results in vortex dy-
namics, we can obtain the change in free energy due to
the formation of a pinwheel, ∆G = (πJp−2kBT ) ln(L/a),
and the phase transition temperature, TKT = πJp/2kB.
The visual cortex arises through activity-dependent re-
ﬁnement of initially unselective patterns of synaptic con-
nections, whereas dense pinwheels emerge when orien-
tation selectivity is ﬁrst established and the density of
pinwheels decreases by annihilations in time. The ob-
served pinwheel densities diﬀer in several species and
such diﬀerence in the pinwheel annihilation rates is dis-
cussed by Wolf et al. [17]. Now we can predict the
relative pinwheel annihilation rates in terms of ∆G or
TKT : (i) As k increases for k > kc, Jp increases and

3

the pinwheels become more unstable. For same ε and σ,
Λ decreases as k increases and the system with a nar-
rower wavelength relaxes to the equilibrium state more
rapidly (Fig. 2 (b) & (c)). (ii) As σ increase, pinwheels
are more unstable. But Λ is proportional to σ, and the
system with a narrower wavelength relaxes to the equi-
(iii) The anni-
librium state more slowly in this case.
hilation rate increases for larger synapse plasticity or a
learning rate ε. (iv) Thermal ﬂuctuations may lead to
the persistence of the pinwheel structure but they also
disturb the map organization. (v) The interaction en-
ergy of a pair of pinwheel-antipinwheel is Epair(~r1, ~r2) =
−2πJp ln(|~r1 − ~r2|/a). But there is a pinwheel annihila-
tion mechanism by collisions not only between opposite
chirality but also with area boundaries. The probability
of collision with area boundaries decreases as the lattice
becomes larger for random moving pinwheels.
(vi) To
include the interactions between OD and OP columns,
our model has to be extended to the O(3) symmetry or
Heisenberg model. The classical anisotropic Heisenberg
model is described by

H = −K

where K > 0. This model predicts that TKT approaches
0 as λ approaches 1 [28]. This result can be translated
as follows: the pinwheel structures last longer or even
become stabilized in the presence of strong OD column
inﬂuences or segregations.

The extension to the Heisenberg model also explains
the orthogonal property between the borders of OD
bands and the IODs that are experimentally observed.
Let us consider the gradient or normal vectors of IODs
at Sx = 0 and Sy = 0. These two vectors intersect per-
pendicularly at pinwheels. The borders of the opposite
ocular dominance domains can be represented as Sz = 0,
which will meet also perpendicularly with other contours,
Sx = 0 or Sy = 0. Therefore, the borders of opposite oc-
ular dominance domains are mathematically equivalent
to iso-orientation contours and intersect perpendicularly

reciprocal interactions rather than the detailed elemental
informations. In the presence of OP and OD map corre-
lations, G = O(3) rather than O(2) × Z2 and such group
representation reveals directly the interactions between
diﬀerent columns. The comprehensive understanding of
distance dependent anisotropic Heisenberg models is not
easy problem by itself and also remains as an important
issue in condense matter physics, the study of which will
have important implications in understanding the inﬂu-
ences of the interactions between OD and OP columns
in the cortical map formation.

The perpendicular tendency with the margin of the
striate cortex is attributable to the similarity between
the gradient of the phase ∇φ and the magnetic ﬁeld
with ∇2φ ∼ 0 derived from the equilibrium condition
δH/δφ = 0. The normal component of ∇φ vanishes at
area boundaries from this condition. This is consistent
with the experimental (Fig. 5) and simulational results.
Considering the complicated structures of the stri-
ate cortex, other map development schemes are possi-
ble. At the moment, however, we implemented the self-
organizing map formation of OP and OD columnar pat-
terns by focusing only on the neighborhood lateral inter-
actions. We believe the detailed structure of receptive
ﬁelds or the scatter in the topographic projection from
retina to cortical locations are not essential ingredients
in the cortical map organization. The structure group G
in our model is more useful representation than the fea-
ture vectors F . It focuses on the transformations by the

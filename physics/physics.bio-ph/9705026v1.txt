(January 8, 2014)

We consider a continuum version of a previously introduced and numerically studied model of
macroevolution [1], in which agents evolve by an optimization process in a rugged ﬁtness landscape
and die due to their competitive interactions. We ﬁrst formulate dynamical equations for the
ﬁtness distribution and the survival probability. Secondly we analytically derive the t−2
law which
characterizes the life time distribution of biological genera. Thirdly we discuss other dynamical
properties of the model as the rate of extinction and conclude with a brief discussion.

Aspects of evolution and extinction can be described as emergent behavior in a large set of interacting agents
[1–4], moving stochastically in a rugged ﬁtness landscape [5]. The behavior of the models of Refs. [2–4] stems from
ﬂuctuations in a time homogeneous stochastic process. This agrees with a commonly held perception, e.g.
implied
when a birth-death process with constant rates [6] is used to ﬁt survivorship data and when the size of extinction events
is presented as a ‘kill curve’ [7]. A quite diﬀerent paradigm is also frequently met in the literature: Raup and Sepkoski
[8] noted that the apparent decrease of the extinction rate through geological times could be ‘... predictable from
ﬁrst principles if one argues that general optimization of ﬁtness through evolutionary time should lead to prolonged
survival ’. Gould [9] uses an unexpected source of statistical data to illustrate evolutionary non-homogeneity as it
reveals itself in the ‘unreversed, but constantly slowing, improvement in mean ﬁelding average through the history of
baseball’. Concurring observations from experimental studies of bacterial evolution in a constant environment can be
found in Ref. [10] as well as from numerical experiments on the ‘long jump dynamics’ of the NK model in Ref. [11].
In this Letter we consider stochastic evolution in a rugged ﬁtness landscape. The assumptions are the same in
spirit as those of a previously introduced and numerically studied ‘reset’ model [1]. However, they are here expressed
in a further simpliﬁed way, allowing a (mainly) analytical rather than (mainly) numerical treatment, and leading
to close form expressions for the survivorship curves and life span distributions, which are of general interest in the
study of complex evolving systems, biological or not. We use two – somewhat extreme – assumptions in line with a
non-stationary evolution paradigm: Firstly, the progeny of individual mutants less ﬁt than the currently dominating
genotype never establish itself within the population. Then, as a macroscopic evolutionary step can only be triggered
by a ﬁtness record within the population, the current typical genotype always codes the best solution found ‘so far’.
Secondly, competitive interactions among species depend on ﬁtness in a non-symmetric way, as evolving species only
kill their less ﬁt neighbors. The predictions of the present model resemble the behavior of the reset model and are in
good agreement with empirical data describing biological genera [6,7,12–15].

In the sequel we ﬁrst derive equations for the ﬁtness distribution of the system P (x, t) and for the probability Wt(τ )
that a tagged species born at time t survive time τ . We then analytically ﬁnd the τ −1 dependence of W and the
ensuing τ −2 dependence of the life-time distribution Rt(τ ). Next we discuss the parametric t dependence which is
not in general analytically available, the eﬀect of averaging over t, and the long time asymptotic behavior of P (x, t)
for diﬀerent parameter values. We conclude by with a brief assessment of the robustness of the model.

To construct a dynamical equation for P (x, t) we proceed in two steps, starting with the limiting case where no
extinctions take place and where, as a consequence of hill climbing in a random ﬁtness landscape, a suitably deﬁned
[1,16,17] average ﬁtness grows logarithmically:

D(t) = log(t + 1).

(1)

With no interactions, an initial ﬁtness distribution would be rigidly shifted in (log) time. As D solves the equation
of motion v(x) = dx/dt = exp(−x) with initial condition D(0) = 0, the time evolution of a distribution of non
interacting agents P (x, t) solves the transport equation: ∂P (x, t)/∂t + ∂(v(x)P (x, t))/∂x = 0. Interactions enter via
an additional term −gP (x, t)K(P (x, t)), where K is an eﬀective killing rate and where the constant g describes what
fraction of the system is aﬀected by an evolutionary event.

Species going extinct vacate a niche, which is reﬁlled at a later time. This in and outﬂow is expediently accounted
by introducing a ‘limbo’ state, which absorbs extinct species, and from which new species emerge at the low ﬁtness
boundary of the system. A ﬁnite upper bound to the total number of species which can coexist implies a conservation

law : N (t) +
0 P (y, t)dy = 1. With the chosen normalization N (t) is the fraction of species in the limbo state, while
P (x, t) is the probability density of ﬁnding a living species with ﬁtness x. The above considerations lead us to the

∀t : P (x = 0, t) = bN (t).

We consider below a form of the killing rate K which is as close as possible to the reset model: The killing at ﬁtness
x is taken to depend on the rate of evolutionary change of agents with ﬁtness larger than x: low-ﬁtness agents suﬀer
if high ﬁtness agents evolve - but not vice versa. This leads to

K(v(x)P (x, t)) = (−

simply expressing the killing rate as the evolutionary current raised to a power. The exponent α just introduced
allows more generality without unduly complicating the analysis: It accounts in a simpliﬁed way for possible (spatial)
correlations eﬀects in a model where information about individual species is retained. If α < 1 (> 1), a move by
an old, slowly evolving species triggers a larger (smaller ) cascade of extinctions than one by a young, fast evolving
species. Figure 1 shows six snaphots of the ﬁtness distribution resulting from the above equations, at times equally
spaced on a logarithmic scale and for α = 1, b = 1 and g = 40.

A quantity often used to characterize paleontological data is the survivorship curve of a cohort or the closely related
life span distribution [6]. In our treatment the former quantity corresponds to the probability Wt(τ ) that an agent
appearing at time t survive time τ , while the latter can be found from Wt(τ ) by diﬀerentiation:

As an agent born at t and alive at time t + τ invariably has ﬁtness D(τ ) = ln(τ + 1) and as the probability of being

killed in the interval dτ is K(P (D(τ ), t + τ ))dτ , W must obey the diﬀerential equation:

Rt(τ ) = −

r(t) = g

P (x, t)K(P (x, t))dx = dN/dt + bN.

with initial condition Wt(τ = 0) = 1.

Finally, the model extinction rate is simply the fraction of species which die per unit of time, at time t:

Note that if b → ∞, then extinct species are immediately replaced, as in Ref. [1]. Furthermore for any b and large bt
dN/dt is negligible and bN (t) → r(t) so that the extinction closely balances the inﬂow.

As a ﬁrst step towards the solution of Eq.3, we set q = vP and notice that q can be written as q(z(x, t)) with

and where z(x, t) satisﬁes

dq/dz = −gqα+1,

∂z/∂t + v(x)∂z/∂x = 1.

The solution of Eq.8 is simply q = (αgz)−1/α. To solve Eq.9 we let A and B be any two functions of a single real
variable x, which are continuous for x > 0 and which vanish identically for x < 0. For v = exp(−x), the general solution
has the form z(x, t) = ǫ exp(x) + (1 − ǫ)t + A(t + 1 − exp(x)) + B(exp(x) − (t + 1)) for some constant ǫ < 1. Utilizing the
initial and boundary conditions, we ﬁnd A(y) = (bN (y))−α, y > 0 and B(y) = (y +1)αP0(log(y +1))−α −gαy, y > 0,
leading to

Note that P is continuous in x, although its derivative will in general be discontinuous at x = D(t).

The survival probability of a species born at time t (the survivorship curve of a cohort [6]), can be obtained
analytically by solving Eq.6. This is so because when inserting D(τ ) in lieau of x in Eq.11, the τ dependence in the
argument of the (unknown) function N drops out. The solution is:

Wt(τ ) =

(bN (t))−α
(bN (t))−α + gατ (cid:21)

.

As W vanishes for large τ , all species eventually die, regardless of the value of α. This behavior is very desirable from
a modeling point of view, as it agrees with the fact that by far the largest number of species which ever lived are now
extinct [14]. The distribution of life spans can be obtained from Eq.12 by diﬀerentiation, as expressed in Eq.5. If α
is close to unity, we ﬁnd a τ −1 behavior for Wt(τ ), and hence a τ −2 for Rt(τ ), independently of t.

Averaging these distributions with respect to t over a time window T is needed if the time of appearance of species
is not precisely known, or if data are scarce. Weighing Rt(τ ) by the normalized rate at which new species ﬂow into
the system we obtain:

R(τ ) =

T −τ
0
R

N (t)Rt(τ )dt
T
0 N (t)dt

.

Of course, averaging does not change the behavior signiﬁcantly if T is short compared to the typical lifetime of the
species. In the opposite limit, the behavior is also maintained if N (t) does not not vanish ’too rapidly’ in the limit
t → ∞. To better appreciate this last point, we use Eq.13 in conjunction with Eqs.12 and 5, and express N −α by
Wt(τ ), obtaining:

T −τ
0
R

−1−1/α

R(τ ) = g(gατ )

Even though this integral cannot be evaluated explicitly, Eq.12 shows that the τ dependence of the integrand is
negligible if the inequality αgτ > (bN (y))−α holds throughout the integration interval. The τ dependence stemming
from the limits of the integrals can also be ignored for τ << T . Hence R ∝ τ −1−1/α, similarly to the non-averaged
case. As shown later, when α close to unity and g suﬃciently large, the model yields r(t) ≈ bN (t) ≥ t−δ , with δ
close to 0.5, which means that even though τ << T the relation τ > T δα can be fulﬁlled.

We now restrict ourselves to a limiting case in which N (t = 0) = 1 which is formally at variance with our boundary
conditions. However, a limiting process shows that the relevant expression for P (x, t) for x < D(t) remains Eq.11,
while P = 0 for x > D(t). A non-linear equation for N (t) is now obtained by integration of Eq.11, followed by a
change of variables. The result is

Diﬀerentiating Eq.15 with respect to time, and utilizing Eq.7, we ﬁnd the extinction rate:

1 − N (t) =

[gα(t − y) + (bN (y))−α]1/α

r(t) =

t

Z
0

g dy
[gα(t − y) + (bN (y))−α]1+1/α

A closed form solution of these (equivalent) integral equations could not be found in the general case. We notice
however a major diﬀerence in the asymptotic behavior for α < 1 and α ≥ 1. In both cases the time independent
function P∞(x) obtained by taking t → ∞ and by setting N (t) = N∞ 6= 0 in Eq.11 formally satisﬁes the model
equations. However, only for α < 1 is P∞(x) normalizable and thus a true solution. The corresponding steady state
value of N , N∞ is then implicitly given by the relation 1 − N∞ = (bN∞)1−α/(g(1 − α)), which always has a solution
in the unit interval.

In the case α ≥ 1, normalizability of P (x, t) requires that N (t) → 0 for t → ∞. No steady state solution can then
exists, since P (x, t) vanishes with t at any ﬁxed x, as e.g. in the familiar case of simple diﬀusion on the inﬁnite line.
For α < 1, the steady state solution is strictly speaking only approached logarithmically due to the form of D(t).

Neglecting this logarithmic corrections we see from Fig. 2 a power-law approach to a quasistationary behavior over a
substantial time range.

For long times α = 1 and bt >> 1 the term dN/dt in Eq.2 is negligible, and bN (t) ≈ r(t). In this limit we can also
g(t−y)+r(y)−1 which has

neglect N compared to one, thus ﬁnding the following approximate equation for r(t): 1 =
the solution r(t) = (gt)−1.

Fig. 2 shows a r(t) vs. t for α = 0.95 b = 1 and several g values. As noted, for a wide time span, r ∝ t−γ
where γ decreases with increasing g, similarly to the result obtained in the the simulations of the reset model [1]. No
qualitative changes are observed when varying α in a small range below one, or when changing b. In summary, for
α slightly below one, and g is suﬃciently large, the life span distribution (averaged or not) decays algebraically with
an exponent slightly above −2 and the rate of extinction decays with an exponent close to −0.5 untill it reaches a
regime of hardly detectable change.

The most comprehensive empirical life span distribution available, comprising about 17500 extinct genera of marine
animals has been tabulated by Raup [7] from data compiled by Sepkoski [18]. These data cover about 100 million
years and display a very clear t−2 dependence in a log-log plot [1,3] over this range, which concurs with the behavior
of our Rt(τ ). More recent analysis by Baumiller [15] of several data set describing crinoid survivorship - our Wt(τ ) -
over a comparable time span in part concur with a t−1 law, and hence with a t−2 law for the life-time distribution.
Finally, survivorship curves for european mammals were considered by Stanley [12]. These data span approximately
3 million years stretching to the W¨urm period and include much fewer species. The distribution of lifetimes deviates
from a t−2 law by having an extra ’hump’ approximately in the middle of the time range.

Paleontological data are commonly interpreted using a birth and death model [6,15], in which non-interacting
species are born and die with two distinct constant rates of speciation and extinction, λ and µ, and where the genus
becomes extinct together with its last species. Interestingly, the survivorship formula generated by this model is, for
λ = µ and for an initial number of species equal to one, identical to our Eq.12 - with α = 1, as far as its dependence
on the life time -our τ - goes. By continuity so are the model predictions in the often recurring situation when λ ≈ µ.
The similarity in the formulae is however contingent to the initial condition and should be regarded as accidental [19].
In line with the conclusion of the reset model, we have shown analytically that a large body of data describing
evolution on coarse scales of time and taxonomical level can be explained by two very simple ideas: 1) that ﬁtness
records in random searching trigger evolutionary events, and 2) that the species competition is ‘asymmetric’, with
high ﬁtness species being more resilient.

The robustness of this approach has already been analyzed to some extent: The eﬀect of additional and externally
imposed random killings of a fraction of the agents – mimicking catastrophies – has been studied by M. Brandt [21],
who found that the life-span distribution was not aﬀected. This is to be expected, as even very large mass extinction
events - in the model as well as in reality - only account for a small fraction of all extinctions. We also explored
other choices of the killing term in Eq.4, ﬁnding that the 1/t2 law disappears if the asymmetry of the interspecies
interactions is removed, with the possible exception of special values of the coupling constants.

After this paper was submitted the author became aware of a preprint by Manrubia and Paczuski [22], which also
treats evolution and extinctions by means of a transport equation, an ﬁnds a t−2 life-time distribution, albeit the
basic dynamical mechanism is quite diﬀerent from ours.

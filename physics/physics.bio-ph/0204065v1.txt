A Non-equilibrium Thermodynamic Framework for the Dynamics and Stability of
Ecosystems

The population dynamics and stability of ecosystems of interacting species is studied from
the perspective of non-equilibrium thermodynamics by assuming that species, through their
biotic and abiotic interactions, are units of entropy production and exchange in an open ther-
modynamic system with constant external constraints. Within the context of the linear theory
of irreversible thermodynamics, such a system will naturally evolve towards a stable stationary
state in which the production of entropy within the ecosystem is at a local minimum value.
It is shown that this extremal condition leads to equations for the stationary (steady) state
population dynamics of interacting species, more general than those of Lotka-Volterra, and
to conditions on the parameters of the community interaction matrix guaranteeing ecosystem
stability. The paradoxical stability of real complex ecosystems thus has a simple explanation
within the proposed framework. Furthermore, it is shown that the second law of thermodynam-
ics constrains the inter- and intra-species interaction coeﬃcients in the sense of maintaining
stability during evolution from one stationary state to another. A ﬁrm connection is thus
established between the second law of thermodynamics and natural selection.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ecosystems are complex. A typical ecosystem contains over 3000 species, from bacteria to insects, plants
and higher animals [1]. This size, coupled with strong interactions among species and between species and
the abiotic environment, leads to very complex population dynamics. Understanding the dynamics and the
inherent stability of ecosystems is, however, of crucial importance in guiding wildlife management programs,
and in forecasting ecological catastrophes. Modeling of the population dynamics in the traditional ecological
framework has been based on ad hoc extensions of Lotka-Volterra type equations [2–5]. Apart from providing
little theoretical insight or empirical predictive power, such a framework implicitly contains a celebrated paradox
concerning the improbability of stable, complex ecosystems [2].

This paper presents a new look at the questions of ecosystem stability and dynamics from the perspective
of linear irreversible thermodynamics (LIT). The need to frame ecology within a thermodynamic paradigm has
been recognized before [6–9]. In the present work, the ecosystem is modeled as an open thermodynamic system
over which a constant free energy ﬂow is impressed, sunlight. Free energy also enters the ecosystem in the form
of chemical potential, such as nutrients. Interactions internal to the ecosystem, between the individuals of the
species, and interactions between the individuals and the external abiotic environment, cause a time change
of the total entropy of the system. Assuming that the external constraints, energy and nutrient ﬂows, over
the system are constant, the linear theory of irreversible thermodynamics predicts [10], and empirical results
suggest, that the system will evolve towards a stationary state in which the local state variables (and hence
global, extensive variables such as the entropy S) are constant in time. This stationary state is locally stable
in the sense that small ﬂuctuations are naturally damped by ﬂows generated in the directions of the perturbing
forces [10].

Here, I show that writing the entropy change in time of an ecosystem as a many-body expansion in the
interactions between individuals, and between individuals and the abiotic environment, and assuming constant
external constraints and the eventual establishment of a thermodynamic stationary state, leads to general dy-
namical equations for the populations of the interacting species. A LIT condition of minimal entropy production
in the stationary state dictates conditions on the interaction parameters which assure the stability of the ecosys-
tem. Furthermore, it is shown that the second law of thermodynamics imposes restrictions on the inter- and

1

intra-speciﬁc interaction parameters, ensuring stability during the evolution of the system from one stationary
state to another after the external constraints are changed, or after the system is signiﬁcantly perturbed.

II. THE TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

Population modeling in the traditional ecological framework is based on the equations [3],

dpi(t)
dt

= Fi(p1(t), p2(t), ...pn(t)),

n

Fi = pi(bi +

pjcij ).

0 = Fi(p

∗
1(t), p

∗
2(t), ...p

∗
n(t)).

where Fi is, in general, some empirically inspired, nonlinear function of the populations pi of the n species.
For example, for the popular Lotka-Volterra equations (which have the stability characteristics of a much wider
class of ecological models employed in the literature [3]), F takes the following form,

j=1
X
Of much interest in ecology, because of its frequent occurrence in nature, is the so called ecological steady state
in which all growth rates are zero, giving the ﬁxed point, or steady state, populations p∗
i ,

The local population dynamics and stability in the neighborhood of the ﬁxed point can be determined by
expanding Eqn. (1) in a Taylor series about the steady state populations,

From equation (7) it is obvious that local asymptotic stability near the steady state requires that the real
parts of all the eigenvalues of A must be negative. This condition gives rise to very restrictive relations among
the components aij of the community matrix A [3]. For example, it can be shown that for a n = 2 species
community it requires that

For a community of arbitrary n species, it can be shown that the requirement that the n
all real parts of its eigenvalues negative is equivalent to the demonstration of the existence of a positive deﬁnite
quadratic function V = xTPx (Lyapunov function) having its derivative with respect to time negative deﬁnite
[11].

×

The restrictions on the components of the community matrix for ensuring stability are thus speciﬁc, and are
more speciﬁc the more complex the ecosystem [3]. Consequently, the probability that a randomly constructed
community will be stable decreases rapidly with the size of the ecosystem, becoming practically zero at an
ecosystem size of only about 10 strongly interacting species [2,12,13]. This leads to a celebrated paradox:
Without a mechanism for ﬁne tuning the community matrix, there should be little probability of ﬁnding stable
complex ecosystems. However, in nature, most ecosystems are very complex and most are stable [1,14].

There have been many attempts to reconcile the theory with the ﬁeld data [3,5,15–20]. The most plausible
of these has been to invoke natural selection as the mechanism for tuning the parameters of the community
matrix [3]. This explanation, however, may be criticized as being tautological since there is no physical reason
postulated for the selection of interaction coeﬃcients leading to stability. Or, from another perspective, it leads
to the celebrated problem of natural selection working on the evolution of a system of a population of one [21].
A scenario in which the elements of the community matrix are fortuitously chosen at random can be discarded
on the basis of statistical improbability of achieving stability for these large systems containing upwards of 3000
species.

III. A PROPOSED THERMODYNAMIC FRAMEWORK

The linear theory of irreversible thermodynamics provides an interesting framework for accommodating the
problem of ecosystem dynamics and stability. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate this by showing
that steady state ecosystems have the signatures of thermodynamic stationary states. The starting postulate
of this paper is that the total change of entropy of the ecosystem may be written as a many-body expansion of
entropy changes due to interactions among individuals. Speciﬁcally,

(12)

The Γi represent the change of entropy due to 1-body interactions of individuals with their abiotic environment
(eg. evapotranspiration, photo-synthesis, respiration, metabolic heat transfer to environment, etc.); Γij rep-
resents 2-body interactions between individuals (eg. predator-prey, competition, symbiosis, mutualism, etc.);
Γijk correspond to the 3-body interactions, and O(4) represents 4-body and higher order interactions (eg. those
required for the functioning of societies). Although this formulation of the total entropy change is perhaps not
the most general imaginable, it is a most common scheme chosen for systems in which the interacting con-
stituents cannot be considered as ideal points in space-time, and in which no singularities are expected. Similar
many-body expansion are used, for example, for representing the interactions between extended, deform-able
charged objects such as atoms in molecules and clusters [22], and nucleons in nuclei [23].

The total time change of entropy is a sum of an external term of no deﬁnite sign, and, as required by the

second law of thermodynamics, an internal term of positive deﬁnite sign,

The external part of the change of entropy can be associated with the one body interactions of the individuals
with their abiotic environment,

The internal dissipative part is then associated with the 2-body and higher order interactions among the
participating individuals,

In the stationary state, dS/dt = 0, and since the internal dissipation is positive by the second law, then,

indicating that at least one of the species must bring negative entropy into the ecosystem, and that this negative
entropy is greater than the positive entropy given back to the environment by the other one-body exchanges.
This role is most often played by the photo-synthesizing species.

(cid:12)
(12) will be truncated at the two-body terms. The justiﬁcation for this is that, for most ecosystems, higher
order n-body interactions will be less probable since they require n-body localization within a limited space-time
volume. The two-body truncation is in fact the norm in most ecological studies [3,24,25] with few exceptions
[26]. This truncation, however, is certainly not valid for ecosystems with societal species, in which higher n-body
interactions play an important role. The more general dynamical equations and stability relations obtained from
the complete equation (12) employing equation (17) will be discussed in a forthcoming article. Thus, taking
equation (12) only to second order in the interactions, Eqn. (17) gives

A simple change of variable makes these equations recognizable as equivalents of those deﬁning the steady state
populations in the ecological framework using the Lotka-Volterra equations, Eqs. (2), and conditions (3). For
example, for the case of n = 2, the appropriate substitutions are, Γ1

In the stationary state, assuming linear phenomenological laws (see below), the internal dissipation of entropy,

To second order in the interactions, this leads to the following conditions on the interaction parameters,

With the variable substitutions introduced above, these relations can be recognized as suﬃcient conditions
for stability of the steady state populations in the ecological framework, equations (10) and (11). That these
conditions for arbitrary ecosystem size n in this thermodynamic framework are the same as those imposed on
the community matrix for stability in the ecological framework can be demonstrated as follows: Consider the
quadratic function

V = xTΓx = (p

where Γ is the matrix of entropy change due to 2-body interactions Γij. The internal entropy production of
the ecosystem at arbitrary populations p, i.e. pTΓp, and that at the stationary state populations, p∗TΓp∗ are
both positive deﬁnite by the second law of thermodynamics. Since the internal production of entropy is at a
minimum in the stationary state, V is thus also positive deﬁnite. The time derivative of V is

A most general result of linear irreversible thermodynamics is that the time change of the internal production

value of zero at the stationary state populations p∗, it is obvious that dV
is negative deﬁnite. We have thus
dt
found the Lyapunov function V which establishes the local asymptotic stability of the community matrix. An
ecological steady state thus has the characteristics of a thermodynamic stationary state and it is tempting to
consider the former as a particular case of the latter.

These stability conditions can be shown to be somewhat more general. For example, consider the case of a
system evolving from one stationary state to another [10]. The second law of thermodynamics requires that
always

Equation (27) can only always be satisﬁed, for whatever values of the populations, if the ﬁrst of conditions (21)
are met. For ecosystems in which (Γ12 + Γ21) is negative, the second of conditions (21) must also be met. The
second law of thermodynamics thus places restrictions on the values of the inter- and intra-speciﬁc interaction
parameters in the direction of securing ecosystem stability during evolution. The association of the second law
with natural selection is thus implied.

IV. PHENOMENOLOGICAL LAWS AND RECIPROCITY RELATIONS

The employment of the condition of minimal internal entropy production and that of the negative deﬁniteness
of the time change of the internal entropy production implicitly assumed the linearity of the phenomenological
laws and the reciprocity relations of Onsager [10]. To second order in the interactions, the total change of
entropy in the ecosystem, Eqn. (12), can be written in the form,

In terms of generalized ﬂows J and forces X [10],

The ﬂows and forces can thus be assigned in the following manner,

, Xi = pi.

The generalized forces are thus the populations of the species and the ﬂows are the total changes of entropy
due to the two-body interaction of species i with the rest of the species j. The phenomenological relations are
thus of the linear form,

where the phenomenological coeﬃcients are,

From this and equation (21), or the condition following from equation (27), it follows that,

The reciprocity relations of Onsager and the positive deﬁnite nature of the proper phenomenological coeﬃcients
are thus satisﬁed to 2nd order in the interactions, within or out of the stationary state.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In the work presented here, interactions between the individuals have been taken only to second order. This
was justiﬁed on the basis of the smaller probability of higher n-body interactions, and was intended for simplicity
and for comparing results with traditional ecological approaches based on Lotka-Volterra type equations, which,

in general, are also of second order.
Including higher order interactions means that the phenomenological
relations will then no longer be linear, implying that the condition of minimal entropy production no longer
strictly applies. However, the more general result found by Prigogine and co-workers [10], concerning the rate
of internal entropy production, can still be used in this nonlinear regime. In a forthcoming paper it will be
shown that this gives rise to wider spectrum of dynamical behavior for the populations.

In the case of changing external constraints, or, more generally, an evolving ecosystem in which the phe-
nomenological coeﬃcients (interaction parameters) cannot be treated as constants, again the linear theory does
not apply. However, it is still valid, as has been shown here, that the universal law of positive internal entropy
production places restrictions on the possible values of the interaction parameters in the direction of securing
ecosystem stability.

Although we have shown in this paper that large, complex ecosystems are constrained to stability by results
from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we have not argued why such systems might be favored over smaller,
less complex ones, as appears to be the case in nature. Although it is not the intention of this paper to
suggest a general evolutionary criterium for ecosystems, a possible explanation, not in conﬂict with the proposed
framework, has been presented by Swenson [21]. Swenson argues that of all the possible paths available to a
system after the removal of an external constraint, a thermodynamic system will take the path which increases
the entropy of the system plus environment at the fastest rate given the remaining constraints. Large, complex
ecosystems are more eﬃcient at producing entropy than are smaller ones, and thus would be favored by nature
if this theory were correct.

It is interesting that this apparent duality of ecosystems, to move towards stationary states of minimal entropy
production over relatively short time scales where the external constraints can be considered constant, and
towards stable systems of higher internal entropy production over longer evolutionary time scales, is mirrored
within individuals. It appears that an individual advances towards a state of minimal entropy production over
development from birth to death [10], while there is empirical evidence suggesting that there is an evolutionary
trend in individuals towards higher metabolic rates (implying higher individual entropy production) [28].

In conclusion, non-equilibrium thermodynamics can serve as a useful framework for describing the dynamics
and stability of ecosystems. In this framework, under the postulates of LIT, the stability of the community
matrix is guaranteed, independent of its size, and there is thus no complexity-stability paradox. Under constant
external constraints the thermodynamic system evolves naturally towards a stable stationary state. A stable
stationary state, characterized by minimal internal entropy production, implies a stable community matrix
if the total change of entropy of the ecosystem can be written as a many-body expansion of interactions
between individuals as postulated here. The second law of thermodynamics places restrictions on the interaction
parameters in the sense of maintaining community stability during the evolution of the ecosystem from one
stationary state to another. This establishes a ﬁrm connection between natural selection and non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and the second law of thermodynamics.

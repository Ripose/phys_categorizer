By deﬁning the phenotype of a biopolymer by its active three-dimensional shape, and its geno-
type by its primary sequence, we propose a model that predicts and characterizes the statistical
distribution of a population of biopolymers with a speciﬁc phenotype, that originated from a given
genotypic sequence by a single mutational event. Depending on the ratio g0 that characterizes the
spread of potential energies of the mutated population with respect to temperature, three diﬀerent
statistical regimes have been identiﬁed. We suggest that biopolymers found in nature are in a crit-
ical regime with g0 ≃ 1 − 6, corresponding to a broad, but not too broad, phenotypic distribution
resembling a truncated L´evy ﬂight. Thus the biopolymer phenotype can be considerably modiﬁed
in just a few mutations.

INTRODUCTION

The biological function (or phenotype) of a biopoly-
mer, such as a ribonucleic acid (RNA) or a protein,
is mostly determined by the three-dimensional struc-
ture resulting from the folding of linear sequence of nu-
cleotides (RNA) or aminoacids (proteins) that speciﬁes a
genotype. Generally, a natural biopolymer sequence (or
genotype) codes for a speciﬁc two-dimensional or three-
dimensional structure that deﬁnes the biopolymer activ-
ity. But one sequence can simultaneously fold in several
metastable structures that can lead to diﬀerent pheno-
types. Thus, random mutations of a sequence induce
random changes of the metastable structure populations,
which generates a random walk of the biopolymer func-
tion. Understanding this phenotype random walk is a
basic goal for ”quantitative” biomolecular evolution.

The statistical properties of RNA secondary structures
considered as a model for genotypes have been investi-
gated in depth in the recent years [1]. The neutral net-
work concept [2, 3], i.e., the notion of a set of sequences,
connected through point mutations, having roughly the
same phenotype, has been shown to apply to RNA sec-
ondary structures. Thus, by drifting rapidly along the
neutral network of its phenotype, a sequence may come
close to another sequence with a qualitatively diﬀerent
phenotype, which facilitates the acquisition of new phe-
notypes through random evolution. Moreover, in the
close vicinity of any sequence with a given structure,
there exist sequences with nearly all other possible struc-
tures [4], as originally proposed in immunology [5]. Thus,
even if the sequence space is much too vast to be explored
through random mutations in a reasonable time (an RNA
with 100 bases only has 1060 possible sequences), the phe-
notype space itself may be explored in a few mutations
only, which is what matters biologically. These ideas have
been brought into operation in a recent experiment [6]
showing that a particular RNA sequence, catalyzing a

given reaction, can be transformed into a sequence hav-
ing a qualitatively diﬀerent activity, using a small num-
ber of mutations and without ever going through inactive
steps.

This paper investigates the phenotype space explo-
ration at an elementary level by studying the statistical
distribution of a population of biopolymers in a speciﬁc
three-dimensional shape, that originated from a given
genotypic sequence by a single mutational event. It com-
plements studies of the evolution from one structure to
another structure [7], that consider only the most sta-
ble structure for each sequence and neglect the ther-
modynamical coexistence of diﬀerent structures for the
same sequence. It also provides more grounds to the re-
cent work that suggests that RNA molecules with novel
phenotypes evolved from plastic populations, i.e., pop-
ulations folding in several structures, of known RNA
molecules [8]. It is experimentally evident, for instance in
[6], that some mutations change the biopolymer chemical
activity by a few percents while other mutations change it
by orders of magnitude. This is not unexpected since, de-
pending on their positions in the sequence, some residues
have a dramatic inﬂuence on the 3D conformation while
others hardly matter. Thus, the function random walk
statistically resembles a L´evy ﬂight [9, 10, 11] presenting
jumps at very diﬀerent scales. The respective parts of
gradual changes and of sudden jumps in biological evolu-
tion is a highly debated issue. While the gradualist point
of view has historically dominated, evidences for the pres-
ence of jumps have accumulated at various hierarchical
levels from paleontology [12], to trophic systems, chemi-
cal reaction networks and neutral networks and molecu-
lar structure [7]. The jump issue will be treated here by
studying the statistical distribution describing the phe-
notype eﬀects of random mutations of a biopolymer geno-
type.

To address the question of the statistical eﬀects of ran-
dom mutations of functionally active biopolymers, we
propose a model inspired from disordered systems physics

that naturally predicts the possibility of broad distri-
butions of activities of randomly mutated biopolymers.
With two energy parameters describing the polymer en-
ergy landscape, this models is shown to exhibit a vari-
ety of behaviors and to ﬁt experimental data. Natural
biopolymers are in a critical regime, related to the ac-
tivity distribution broadness, in which a single mutation
may have a large, but not too large, eﬀect.

II. PHYSICAL MODEL OF SHAPE
POPULATION DISTRIBUTION

The most favorable conformational state of a biopoly-
mer sequence with a given biological activity is gener-
ally considered to be the most stable one within the se-
quence energy landscape. The ruggedness of the energy
landscape might vary depending on the number of other
metastable, conformational states accessible by the se-
quence. The typical energy spacing between these states
can be small enough so that several states of low en-
ergy can be populated. For simplicity, we will consider
a sequence that is able to fold into its two lowest en-
ergy conformational states, an active state A of speciﬁc
biological function, and an inactive state I of unknown
function, but whose energy is the closest to A’s (higher
or lower) (see ﬁgure 1). The diﬀerences between the free
energies of the unfolded and folded states for A and I are
denoted ∆GA and ∆GI, respectively.

A mutation, i.e., a random change in the biopolymer
sequence, modiﬁes the biopolymer energy landscape so
that ∆GA and ∆GI are transformed into (∆GA)M and
(∆GI)M. Note that the conformer state A of the mu-
tant, its three dimensional shape, is the same as before
whereas the conformer state I does not have to be the
same as before. To take into account the randomness
of the mutational process, the mutant free energy diﬀer-
(∆GA)M is taken either with a

stable than I, and hence that πA is predominantly less
than 50%. For small g0, the distribution PG(πA) is nar-
row since the width δG0 of the free energy distribution is
small compared to RT so that there are only small ﬂuc-
tuations of population around the most probable value.
When the energy broadness g0 increases, the single nar-
row peak ﬁrst broadens till, when g0 & 1.976 it splits into
two peaks, close respectively to πA = 0 and to πA = 1.
The broad character of PG(πA) can be intuitively under-
stood as a consequence of the non linear dependence of
πA on δGM. Thus, when the ﬂuctuations of δGM are
larger than RT , i.e., when g0 & 1, the quasi exponential
dependence of πA on δGM (eq. (3)) non linearly magniﬁes
δGM ﬂuctuations to yield a broad πA distribution, even
if δGM ﬂuctuations are relatively small compared to the
mean δG. A similar mechanism is at work for tunneling
in disordered systems [14, 15].

A global view of the possible shapes of PG(πA) is given
in ﬁgure 3. For any given ¯g, when increasing g0 starting
from 0, the single narrow peak of PG(πA) ﬁrst broadens
then it splits into two peaks when ¯g = ¯gsign(¯g)(g0) with

(This expression results from a lengthy but straightfor-
ward study of PG(πA).) When g0 increases further, these
two peaks get closer to πA = 0 and to πA = 1 while ac-
quiring signiﬁcant tails (see section VII). For any given
g0, increasing ¯g roughly amounts to moving the popula-
tions πA towards larger values as expected since larger
¯g’s correspond to stabler states A. However, distinct be-
haviours arise depending on g0. If g0 < √2, whatever the

PG(πA) are either unimodal or bimodal, either broad or
narrow. This variety of behaviors is reminiscent of beta
distributions.

IV. FROM SHAPE POPULATIONS TO
CATALYTIC ACTIVITIES

Up to now, we have discussed the distribution P (πA)
of the population of a shape A that is functionally ac-
tive. However, as far as it concerns biopolymers with
enzymatic functions, what is usually measured is a chem-
ical activity a, i.e., the product of a reaction rate k
for the conformer A by the population πA of this con-
former. The reaction rates are given by the Arrhenius
Ea/RT where k0 is a constant and Ea is the
law k = k0e−
activation energy. Thus, the chemical activity writes, us-
ing eq. (3):

a = k0e−

Ea/RT

1
δGM/RT .
1 + e−

(7)

Random mutations may induce random modiﬁcations of
Ea, δGM or both. Fluctuations of δGM have been treated
above. One can introduce ﬂuctuations of Ea in the same
way. We do not do it here in details but present only the
general trends.

The eﬀects of adding an activation energy distribution
in addition to the free energy diﬀerence distribution are
twofold. For small activities, the distribution P (a) of
chemical activities is similar to the small P (πA) peak at

1 peak of P (πA).

small πA. Indeed, the reaction rate k depends exponen-
tially on Ea, just as the population πA depends exponen-
1. Moreover, the product of
tially on δGM when πA ≪
two broadly distributed random variables is also broadly
distributed [25] with a shape similar to the one of P (πA).
For large activities, on the other hand, πA and k behave
diﬀerently because πA is bounded by 1 while k is un-
bounded. Thus, if the k distribution is broad enough,
the distribution of a at large a may exhibit a broadened
structure compared to the πA ≃
In summary, the distribution of chemical activities
P (a) is similar to the distribution of shape populations
0 peak (condi-
P (πA) when P (πA) presents a large πA ≃
tions for this to occur are explicited in section VI). Thus,
by observing the shape of the a
0 peak in the activ-
ity distribution P (a), one does not easily distinguish be-
tween activation energy dispersion, which aﬀects k, and
free energy diﬀerence dispersion, which aﬀects πA. On
the other hand, at large a, P (a) is diﬀerently aﬀected
by activation energy dispersion and by free energy dif-
ference dispersion. The available experimental data (see
section V) enables us to analyze precisely P (a) at small
activities but not at large activities. Thus, for practical
purposes, it is not meaningful in this paper to consider
a distribution of activation energies on top of a distri-
bution of free energy diﬀerences. In the sequel, we will
thus do as if only the distribution of free energies was
involved, stressing that similar eﬀects can be obtained
from a distribution of activation energies.

V. ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Comparison of the theoretical distributions of eq. (5)
and eq. (4) with experimental data enables to test the
relevance of the proposed model. We have analyzed the
measurements of the catalytic activities of a set of 157
mutants derived from a self-splicing group I ribozyme, a
catalytic RNA molecule [16] (out of the 345 mutants gen-
erated in [16], we only considered the 157 ones with single
point mutations). The original ”wild-type” molecule is
formed of a conserved catalytic core that catalyzes the
cleavage of another part of the molecule considered as
the substrate. The set of mutants is derived from the
original ribozyme by performing systematically all single
point mutations of the catalytic core, i.e., of the part of
the molecule that inﬂuences most the catalytic activity.
Nucleotides out of the core, that in general inﬂuence less
the catalytic activity, are left unmutated. Thus, in our
framework, this set of mutants can be seen as biased to-
wards deleterious mutations.
Indeed, mutations of the
quasi optimized core are likely to lead to much less ac-
tive mutants, while mutations of remote parts are likely
to leave the activity essentially unchanged. If all parts
of the molecule had been mutated, more neutral or quasi
neutral mutations would have been obtained. Another
point of view, which we adopt here is to consider the cat-
alytic core as a molecule in itself, on which all possible

single point mutations have been performed.

The 157 measured activities are used to calculate a
population distribution with inhomogenous binning (cf.
broad distribution). Two bins required special treament:
the smallest bin, centered in 0.5%, contains 40 mutants
with non measurably small activities (< 1% of the orig-
inal activity); the largest bin, centered in 95%, contains
the 6 mutants with activities larger than 90% of the orig-
inal ’wild’ RNA activity (the largest measured mutant
activity is 140%). These two points, whose abscissae are
arbitrary within an interval, are not essential for the ob-
tained results. At last, as very few mutants have ac-
tivities larger than the wild-type ribozyme, the propor-
tionality constant between activity and population is set
by matching a population πA = 1 to the activity of the
wild-type ribozyme.

−

The obtained distribution (see ﬁgure 4) has a large
peak in πA ≃
0, indicating that most mutations are dele-
terious, with a long tail at larger activities and a possible
1. This non trivial shape is well ﬁt-
smaller peak in πA ≃
3.6 and
ted by the Gaussian model of eq. (4) with ¯g =
g0 = 2.9 (the uncertainty on these parameters is about
50%, see broken lines in ﬁgure 4). One infers δG

1.7 kcal/mol (T = 300 K). The
kcal/mol and δG0 ≃
order of magnitude of these values is compatible with
thermodynamic measurements performed on similar sys-
tems [17, 18, 19, 20]. This conﬁrms the plausibility of the
proposed approach. The inset of ﬁgure 4 shows the pop-
ulation distribution in the exponential model with ¯g and
g0 values taken from the Gaussian ﬁt. The agreement
with the experimental data is also quite good. Thus, the
proposed approach soundly does not strongly depend on
the yet unknown shape details of the energy distribution.

Finally, one can estimate the broad character of the ac-
tivity distribution from the statistical analysis of the ex-
perimental data. Indeed, according, e.g., to the Gaussian
model ﬁt, the typical, most probable, population πA is
6 while the mean population is
found to be
0.15. Thus, the activity distribution spans more than

VI. COARSE GRAINING DESCRIPTION: ALL
OR NONE FEATURES

The variation of activity of a biopolymer upon muta-
tion is often described as an ‘all or none’ process: muta-
tions are considered either as neutral (the mutant retains
fully its activity and πA ≃
100 %) or as lethal (the mu-
0 %). Sat-
tant looses completely its activity and πA ≃
isfactorily, a coarse graining description of the proposed
statistical models exhibits such all or none regimes for
appropriate (¯g, g0) values, as well as other regimes.

To obtain a quantitative coarse graining description,
we deﬁne the mutants with ’no’ activity as those with
population that has less than 12 % (
πA(δGM =
2RT )) in the A shape. Their weight is

tributions are actually present in this model: probabil-
ities concentrated at small, intermediate or large values
(0, i or 100); probabilities spread over both small and
intermediate (0 & i), both small and large (0 & 100, all
or none) or both intermediate and large (i & 100) values;
probabilities spread over small, intermediate and large
values at the same time (0 & i & 100). The coarse grain-
ing classiﬁcation of ﬁgure 5 complements the number of
peaks classiﬁcation of ﬁgure 3 without overlapping it. In-
deed, there exist parameters g0 and ¯g for which, e.g.,
two peaks coexist but one of these peaks has a negligible
weight. Thus the presence of a peak is not automatically
associated to a large weight in the region of this peak.

Thus, if a living organism has to adapt the chemical ac-
tivity of one of its biopolymer constituents, it can explore
several order of magnitude of activity by only few muta-
tions within the biopolymer. The activity changes mimic
a L´evy ﬂight [22] as revealed, e.g., by the experimental
data in [6]. The large activity changes will raise self-
averaging issues [15] that will add up to those generated
by correlations along evolutionary paths [23]

Three broadness regimes corresponding to three evo-
lutionary regimes can be distinguished.
If g0 is very
large, the mutant activities span a very large range. This
regime might be globally lethal because, in most cases,
the mutant activity will be either too low or too large to
be biologically useful. However, under conditions of in-
tense stress, the large variability might allow the system
to evolve radically. With g0 = 10, for instance, the ac-
tivity range covers typically 12 orders of magnitude from
6e¯g to 106e¯g (see eq. (11)). If g0 is moderately large,
10−
the mutant activities span just a few orders of magni-
tude. This regime is broad enough to permit signiﬁcant
changes, but not too broad to avoid producing too many
lethal changes. With g0 = 3, for instance, the activity
range covers typically 3
4 orders of magnitude from
1.8e¯g to 101.8e¯g.
10−
If g0 is small, the lognormal dis-
tribution peak can be approximated by a Gaussian [15]

The distribution is now narrow and the ranges of val-
ues is typically [e¯g(1
2g0), e¯g(1 + 2g0)]. This type of
distribution is not adapted for producing large changes,
but rather for performing ﬁne tuning optimization. With
g0 = 0.1, for instance, the activity range covers only

20% around e¯g.

We remark that the group I ribozyme which we have

analyzed corresponds to g0 ≃
regime of moderately large g0. One can guess from ex-
perimental studies of other biopolymers or from chemi-
cal considerations that most biopolymers will fall in this
range since δG0 is typically on the order of a few kilo-
0.6 kcal.

FIG. 6: Free energy dispersion δG0 as a function of tempera-
ture T for diﬀerent parameters g0. We suggest that, given T ,
evolution favors g0 ≃ 1 − 6 and thus molecules with δG0 in
the range indicated by the graph.

This discussion suggests that there is an evolutionary
preferred type of activity distribution, associated to a
range of energy dispersion. This range is such that each
mutation typically generates a signiﬁcant, but not sys-
tematically lethal, activity change. If one considers that
the activity changes must cover between, say, one and
seven orders of magnitude, then the allowed g0 range is
6 (see eq. (11)). Thus, we propose that, for a given
1
temperature T , evolution will favor molecules whose mu-
tant free energy dispersion δG0 belong to a preferred in-
terval (see ﬁgure 6).

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have presented a model for the distri-
bution of biopolymer activities resulting from mutations
of a given sequence. The model is characterized by the
statistics of the energy diﬀerences between active con-
formations and inactive conformations. A similar model
would be obtained by considering the statistics of acti-
vation energies. The model ﬁts the measured activity
distribution of a ribozyme with energy parameters in the
physically appropriate range.
It is also able to repro-
duce commonly observed behaviours such as all or none.
It may also apply to the study of the time dependent
ﬂuctuations of catalytic rates recently observed for the
enzymatic digestion of λ-phage DNA by bacteriophage λ
exonuclease molecules [24].

Importantly, the peak of small activities exhibits three
distinct types depending on the broadness of the distri-
bution of energy diﬀerences. Real biopolymers are in a
critical regime allowing the exploration of diﬀerent ranges
of activities in a few mutations without being too often
lethal. This critical regime seems the the most favor-
able evolutionary regime and could be the statistical en-
gine allowing molecular evolution. Thus the present work

supports the idea that, for evolution to take place, the
temperature and the physico-chemistry dictating the free
energy scales of biopolymers must obey a certain ratio.
At last, it suggests that, by looking at small variations

of this ratio, one might be able to classify biopolymers.
One expects, for instance, that biopolymers from rapidly
evolving cells will have larger g0 than biopolymers from
stable, optimized cells.

[25] With Gaussian distributions of δGM and Ea, one can
be more speciﬁc. Both πA and k are then lognormally
distributed at small values. Thus, the product a = kπA
is also lognormally distributed [15].

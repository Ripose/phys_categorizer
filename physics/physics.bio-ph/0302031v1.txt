We show that textual analysis of microbial genomes
reveal telling footprints of the early evolution of the
genomes. The frequencies of word occurrence of ran-
dom DNA sequences considered as texts in their four
nucleotides are expected to obey Poisson distributions.
It is noticed that for words less than nine letters the av-
erage width of the distributions for complete microbial
genomes is many times that of a Poisson distribution.
We interpret this phenomenon as follows: the genome
is a large system that possesses the statistical charac-
teristics of a much smaller “random” system, and cer-
tain textual statistical properties of genomes we now
see are remnants of those of their ancestral genomes,
which were much shorter than the genomes are now.
This interpretation suggests a simple biologically plau-
sible model for the growth of genomes:
the genome
ﬁrst grows randomly to an initial
length of approxi-
mately one thousand nucleotides (1k nt), or about one
thousandth of its ﬁnal length, thereafter mainly grows
by random segmental duplication. We show that us-
ing duplicated segments averaging around 25 nt, the
model sequences generated possess statistical proper-
ties characteristic of present day genomes. Both the
initial length and the duplicated segment length sup-
port an RNA world at the time duplication began. Ran-
dom segmental duplication would greatly enhance the
ability of a genome to use its hard-to-acquire codes re-
peatedly, and a genome that practiced it would have
evolved enormously faster than those that did not.
The genome is a highly complex network of embed-
ded codes generated in a very long process of evo-
lution co-driven by chance mutations and misrepli-
cations on the one hand and natural selection on
the other. The fact that both processes are stochas-
tic makes it that much harder to uncover what the
the earliest genome looked like when life ﬁrst arose.
Adding the extreme diversity of organisms to the
complexity of each genome would seemingly render
the task of unmasking the early genome even more
daunting. It is therefore signiﬁcant when a large set
of diverse and complex genomes share an unexpected
common or universal property. Here we report one
kind of universality in the textual property of the
genomes that allows us to deduce a mode of growth
which could be common to all early genomes.
Frequency of occurrence of oligonucleotides in
microbial genomes
It is a general rule of statistics that very large sys-
tems have sharply deﬁned average properties. When
apples are randomly dropped into barrels, the dis-
tribution of apples in the barrels is governed by the

Poisson distribution.
If 1,024 apples were dropped
into sixty-four barrels, in 95 of 100 cases, each bar-
rel will have between eight and twenty-four apples.
In comparison, if 1 million apples were dropped into
sixty-four barrels, in 95 of 100 cases, each barrel will
have between 15,875 and 15,375 apples. There is a
less than one in 10830 (10980, respectively) chance
that one barrel would get as many (few) as twenty-
four (eight) thousand apples.

Microbial genomes are seemingly random systems
when viewed as texts of the four nucleotides rep-
resented by A, C, G and T. To count the number
of times each of the sixty-four trinucleotides, or 3-
mers, occur in a genome-as-text is similar to count-
ing apples in barrels. The genome of the bacterium
Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis
is about 1M base pairs long and has almost even
base composition [1].
In an astonishing departure
from what is expected of a system of its size, the
genome has six 3-mers (CGC, GCG, AAA, TTT,
GCA, TGC) occurring more than 24,000 times per
1M nt and two (CTA, TAG) less than 8,000 times.
Scrambling the genome sequence thoroughly restores
it to a random sequence obeying Poisson distribution
and the large-system rule.
T. pallidum is not exceptional in disobeying the large-
system rule. For the fourteen complete microbial
genome sequences with approximately even base com-
position (see Methods), the observed standard devi-
ation (s.d.) of the distribution of the frequency of
occurrence (hereafter, simply distribution) of 3-mers
per 1M nt is 4,080±630 around the mean of 15,625.
This is about 32 times the s.d. of a Poisson distri-
bution typifying a random sequence with the same
mean.

Nor is the 3-mer exceptional in the k-mer-statistics
In Table 1, column 3 gives

1M nt, k = 2 to 10, for the fourteen genomic se-
quences and the s.d. of the average (number given
after the ± sign) and column 4 gives the s.d.

a Poisson distribution (that describes a random se-

genomic s.d. is typically much smaller than the dif-
ference between the genomic and Poisson s.d.’s. For
is 40±8
example, at k=2 (k=6) the genomic s.d.
(9.0±1.3) times greater than the Poisson s.d. Thus
the genomic distribution diﬀers from the Poisson dis-
tribution in a universal fashion, and in this sense we
shall speak of a universal genome.
Microbial genomes are large systems with small-
system statistics
The universal genome has the statistical property of
a random sequence much smaller than itself. To see
this, we deﬁne the eﬀective random-sequence length
Lef f of the universal genome as the length of a ran-
dom sequence that has a k-mer distribution with a
mean to s.d. ratio equal to that of the correspond-
ing genomic ratio r. Then Lef f =4kr2, and its values
for the various k’s are given in the last column of
Table 1. One notices that the Lef f of the universal
genome is very short for the smaller k’s - of the order
of 1k nt for k≤3 - and grows with k. When k=10, it
is essentially the same length as the real genome.

A signature of the universal genome is that com-
pared to a random sequence, the former has very
large numbers of both overrepresented and under-
represented oligonucleotides. As a typical represen-
tative of the universal genome, the genome of E. coli
[2] has 500 and 510 6-mers whose frequency of oc-
currences are greater than 400 and 100 per 1M nt,
respectively, while a random sequence has none in ei-
ther category. There are many known examples of in-
dividual oligonucleotide that exhibit extreme relative
abundance. For dinucleotides this was noted to be
common and has genome-wide consistency [3]; tetra-
and hexapalindromes are almost always underrepre-
sented in bacteriophages and are underrepresented
systematically in bacteria where 4-cutting and/or 6-
cutting restriction enzymes are common [4]; an 8-mer
that appears as Chi sites, hotspots of homologous
recombination, is highly overrepresented in E. coli
[5]; in the human pathogens Haemophilus inﬂuen-
zae [6, 7] and Neisseria [8] there are 9- and 10-mers

functioning as uptake signal sequences that are vastly
overrepresented. The causes for these extreme cases
are generally not known and, with the exception of
the dinucleotides, these individual cases do not much
aﬀect the statistical properties of the genome.

What caused a genome to have statistical charac-
teristics so starkly distinct from those of a random
sequence? Natural selection suggests itself as a prime
explanatory candidate. For instance, the 64 frequen-
cies of codons, 3-mers used by the genome to code
proteins in genes, exhibit very wide distributions.
But natural selection by itself does not directly cause
any change in a genome. Such changes are caused
by mutation and other mechanisms, all believed to
occur at random. Natural selection may account for
what changes come to pass; if, however, such changes
always tend to promote or retain a randomness that
exhibits Poisson distribution, then the ability of nat-
ural selection to push the genome very far in a non-
Poisson direction would seem to have its limits.
Model for early genome growth
Here we propose a biologically plausible model for
the growth and evolution of a universal genome that
can generate the observed statistical characteristics
of genomic sequences. The model is very simple and
consists of two phases. In the ﬁrst phase the genome
initially grows to a random sequence whose size is
much smaller than the ﬁnal size of the genome. In
the second phase the genome grows by random dupli-
cations modulated by random single mutations. In
this work a snapshot is taken of the model genome
shortly after it reaches a length of 1M nt. The key
it is most
in the model is growth by duplication;
straightforward way for the universal genome to be-
come what it appears to be: a large system that
exhibits small-system statistical characteristics.

We found it comparatively easy to generate a se-
quence that could faithfully reproduce the genomic
k-mer distribution of a particular k but not those
of other k’s. Typically such a sequence had an ex-
cessively rigid eﬀective random-sequence length and,
consequently, a distribution too narrow (broad) for
smaller (greater) k’s. Several such examples are given
in the Methods. Generating a sequence that would
emulate a real genome was a much more exacting
task.
Result
After extensive experimentation, it was found that
sequences having the statistical characteristics sought
after could be generated from an initial random se-
quence approximately 1k nt long (L0) which was then
grown to 1M nt by random duplication of segments
of length (¯l) averaging 25 nt with a spread (∆l) of
approximately 11 nt (see Methods for detail).

The s.d. of the k-mer distribution of a good model
sequence are given in column ﬁve of Table 1. They
agree quite well with the observed genomic values in
columns two and three although their k-dependence

is slightly too strong. Histograms in Fig. 1 show com-
parisons between the k-mer distributions for k=2, 3
and 4 of the genome of T. pallidum (black) and those
of the model sequence (green/gray).
In all three
cases, the histogram for a random sequence would
be represented by a single tower located at the mean
frequency. For k=2 and to a lesser extent k=3, the
histograms for both genomic and model sequences
display large ﬂuctuations. The model sequence is
not expected to exactly reproduce the counts of the
genomic sequence. Indeed, generated stochastically,
another (good) model sequence would give distribu-
tions indistinguishable from those shown in Fig. 2
but something rather diﬀerent than those shown in
the k=2 and 3 panels of Fig. 1. In any case, all model
sequences would show patterns of ﬂuctuation similar
to those exhibited by the genomic sequence and have
s.d.’s similar to those given in column 5 of Table 1.
Fig. 2 shows comparisons for k=5 to 9. The panel at
the top-left corner compares the 6-mer distribution
from T. pallidum with that of a random sequence ob-
tained by scrambling the T. pallidum genome. The
strong agreement between the microbial genome and
the model sequence contrasts sharply with the glar-
ing diﬀerences between the genome and the random
sequence.

The model sequence is parameter-sensitive:
If L0
was much longer than 1k nt no good model sequence
could be found (this is expected because L0 cannot
be much longer than the shortest Lef f in Table 1);
if either ¯l or ∆l was was changed by more than 10%
from their optimal values of 25 nt and 11 nt respec-
tively the agreement between the genomic and model
sequences would worsen noticeably (see Methods).
No mutations were imposed on the model sequence
whose properties are shown here; twenty thousand
mutation ﬁxations reduces the s.d. of the k-mer dis-

tributions of the model sequence by 4% (for k=2) to
10% (k=10) but under casual inspection the model
sequence - with or without mutation - has the ap-
pearance of a random sequence. Results showing the
model reproducing the k-mer distributions of micro-
bial genomes with highly biased compositions will be
presented elsewhere.

In bacterial genomes, typically about 12% of genes
represent recent duplication events - 12% in T. pal-
lidum [1], 11.2% in H. inﬂuenzae [9] and 12.8% in
V. cholerae [10]. Our model sequence as presented
here does not yet fully explain the pattern of all such
duplications, many of which would involve segments
up to several k nt long. Work is under way to ex-
tend the model to account for the genomic pattern
of repeat sequences of all lengths.
Discussion
We mention some biological and evolutionary impli-
cations assuming our model does capture the essence
of the early growth mechanism of microbial genomes
and, by extension, perhaps of all genomes. Setting
the initial length of our model universal genome be-
fore it began the growth by duplication process to
about 1k nt but not much longer (as required by
observed data) necessarily implies that the univer-
sal genome began its life in an RNA world [11, 12]
in which there were no proteins and RNAs had the
dual roles of genotype and phenotype (see [13] for a
review). This view of the origin of life [14, 15, 16]
gained much credence when RNA was discovered to
exhibit self-splicing and enzymatic activities [17, 18].
Some RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, are very small;
the hammerhead ribozyme is only 31 to 42 nt long
[19] and the hairpin ribozyme is only 50 nt long [20].
Thus the 1k nt initial universal genome was certainly
of suﬃcient size to possess a machinery for sustained

3

evolution and duplication. Our model does not ad-
dress the origin of this initial genome. The likelihood
of its being the evolutionary product of something
that arose spontaneously is enhanced by the succ-
cessful isolation of artiﬁcial ribozymes from pools of
random RNA sequences [21]. The average duplicated
segment length of 25 nt is very short compared to a
present-day gene that codes for a protein, but likely
represents a good portion of the length of a typical
ribozyme encoded in the early universal genome.
Shifting the burden away from natural selection onto
segmental duplication as the main force driving the
universal genomes so far in a non-Poisson direction
implies a much higher evolution rate than it might
have been if natural selection were the only driving
force. The model suggests that uneven codon usage
was not the primary cause of the very broad dis-
tribution of the 3-mer counts seen in the universal
genomes. Rather, the rise of codon was the conse-
quence of an opportunistic evolutionary adaptation
to the already-wide 3-mer distribution that had re-
sulted from growth by duplication. Similarly, many
- but not all - of the highly under- or overrepresented
oligonucleotides we see now must have been recruited
for their respective biological functions after they al-
ready had (the suitable beginnings of) biased fre-
quencies of occurrence.
That some statistical characteristics of a present day
genome are determined by the charateristics of the
genome when it ﬁrst began to grow by duplication
means that we should be able to learn something
about such early genomes, and each such ancestral
genome should be common to a group of present
day genomes that are phylogentically close. Detailed
analyses made along this line of reasoning may bring
us a step nearer in understanding the univeral ances-
tor [22].
Being a natural way to repeatedly utilize hard-to-
come-by codes, growth by duplication is in itself a
brilliant strategy and must have increased the rates
of evolution and species diversion enormously. The
continuity of this strategy after the rise of codons and
proteins is bundantly in evidence. In higher organ-
isms a large number of repeat sequences with lengths
ranging from 1 base to many kilobases are believed
to have resulted from at least ﬁve modes of dupli-
cation [23, 24]. This strategy should provide part
of the answer to the questions [25]: how have genes
been duplicated at the high rate of about 1% per
gene per million years [26]? and why are there so
many duplicate genes in all life forms [27, 28]? The
fact that duplicate genes (after they have diverged)
contribute to genetic robustness by protecting the
genome against harmful mutations [29] is likely not
what caused the proliferation of duplicate genes, but
is rather another example of an adaptation to an ex-
isting situation by natural selection for a beneﬁcial
function.
Methods
The fourteen microbial genome sequences (length
(L) in M nt and G+C probability (p) in brackets) E. coli

K12 (4.64, .50), E. coli 0157 (5.52, .50), M. thermoau-
totrophicum (1.75, .50), A. fulgidus (2.18, .49), T. pal-
lidum (1.14, .53), X. fastidiosa (2.67, 0.53), V. cholerae
chromosomes I (2.96, .48) and II (1.07, .47), Synechococ-
cus sp. (3.57, .48), N. meningitidis serogroup B strain
MC58 (1.57, .52), Y. pestis (4.65, .48), S. typhimurium
(4.86, .52), S. enterica (4.81, .52) and P. aerophilum (2.22,
.51) are obtained from the GenBank [30]. Counting of k-
mers is done by reading through a k-base wide window
that is slid around the (circular) genome once. Counts
are normalized to per 1M nt and bias in base composition
is corrected for by dividing the actual counts by the factor
L2kpn(1 − p)k−n, where n is the total number of G’s and
C’s in each k-mer.
Generation of model sequence. A random sequence
of length L0 is ﬁrst generated. Thereafter the sequence is
altered by single mutations (replacements only) and du-
plications, with a ﬁxed average mutation to duplication
event ratio. In duplication events, a segment of length l,
chosen according to the Erlang probability density func-
tion f (l) = 1/(σm!)(l/σ)me−l/σ, is copied from one site
and pasted onto another site, both randomly selected.
In the above m is an integer and σ is a length scale in
bases. The function gives a mean duplicated segment
length ¯l = (m + 1)σ with s.d. ∆l = (m + 1)1/2σ. The
values m = 0 to 8 and selected values for σ from 3 to
15,000 were used. The model sequence compared with
genomic sequences in the Figures 1 and 2 and in Table 1
was generated with L0 = 1000, m = 4, σ = 5 and without
mutation events. Fine-tuning to ﬁnd the best parameters
was not attempted. The following are some examples that
gave very good distributions for speciﬁc k-mers but not
generally; all were generated with L0 = 1000 and m = 0:
for 6-mer, σ = 13, 000 ± 2, 000 and on average 0.04σ mu-
tations per duplication (these parameters also work for
genomes with biased base compositions) [31]; for 2-mer,
σ = 50, no mutation; for 5-mer, σ = 30, no mutation; for
9-mer, σ = 15, no mutation.
Presentation of data. In Fig. 2 the curves shown are
the result of a small amount of forward and backward
averaging - to remove excessive ﬂuctuations.
In Fig. 1
data bunching was used to produce the towers shown.

(Received March 17, 2003; Revised August 01, 2003)

We investigate if known extrinsic and intrinsic factors fully account for the complex features observed in
recordings of human activity as measured from forearm motion in subjects undergoing their regular daily rou-
tine. We demonstrate that the apparently random forearm motion possesses previously unrecognized dynamic
patterns characterized by fractal and nonlinear dynamics. These patterns are unaffected by changes in the aver-
age activity level, and persist when the same subjects undergo time-isolation laboratory experiments designed
to account for the circadian phase and to control the known extrinsic factors. We attribute these patterns to a
novel intrinsic multi-scale dynamic regulation of human activity.

Control of human activity is complex, being inﬂuenced by
many factors both extrinsic (work, recreation, reactions to
unforeseen random events) and intrinsic (the circadian pace-
maker that inﬂuences our sleep/wake cycle [1] and ultradian
oscillators with shorter time scales [2]). The extrinsic fac-
tors may account for the apparently random ﬂuctuations in hu-
man motion observed over short time scales while the intrinsic
rhythms may account for the underlying regularity in average
activity level over longer periods of up to 24 h. Further, hu-
man activity correlates with important physiological functions
including whole body oxygen consumption and heart rate.

Actiwatch devices [3] are traditionally used to demarcate
sleep versus wakefulness based on average activity levels, or
to observe the mean pattern of activity as it changes across the
day and night according to disease state (Fig. 1). Tradition-
ally activity ﬂuctuations are considered as random noise and
have been ignored. We hypothesize that there are systematic
patterns in the activity ﬂuctuations that may be independent
of known extrinsic and intrinsic factors.

To test our hypotheses, we evaluate the structure of human
activity during wakefulness, using: (i) probability distribution
analysis; (ii) power spectrum analysis, and (iii) fractal scaling
and nonlinear analysis. To elucidate the presence of an in-
trinsic activity control center independent of known circadian,
ultradian, scheduled and random factors, we apply 3 comple-
mentary protocols.

• (A) Daily routine protocol: We record activity data
throughout two consecutive weeks in 16 healthy ambulatory
domiciliary subjects (8 males, 8 females, 19-44 years, mean
27 years) performing their routine daily activities. The only
imposed constraints are that subjects go to bed and arise at the
same time each day (8 h sleep opportunity) and that they are
not permitted to have daytime naps (Fig. 1).

• (B) Constant routine protocol: To assess intrinsic activity
controllers (i.e. circadian or other neural centers) independent
of scheduled and random external inﬂuences activity record-
ings are made in the laboratory throughout 38 h of constant
posture (semi-recumbent), wakefulness, environment (21oC,

dim light [< 8 lux]), dietary intake and scheduled events [4].
This protocol is performed in a subset of subjects (7 males, 4
females) that participated in the daily routine protocol. These
highly controlled and constant experimental conditions result
in reduced average and variance of activity levels.

• (C) Forced desynchrony protocol: To test for the pres-
ence of heretofore unidentiﬁed intrinsic activity control cen-
ters, independent of known activity regulators (circadian pace-
maker), whilst accounting for scheduled and random external
inﬂuences, we employ the validated Forced desynchrony (FD)
protocol [1]. Six (4 male, 2 female) of the 16 subjects that par-
ticipated in the daily routine protocol completed the FD limb
of the study. For eight days subjects remain in constant dim
light (to avoid “resetting” the body clock). Sleep periods are
delayed by 4 h every day, such that subjects live on recurring
28 h “days”, while all scheduled activities become desynchro-
nized from the endogenous circadian pacemaker. Thus, as
measurements occur across all phases of the circadian clock,
the effect of intrinsic circadian inﬂuences can be removed [1].
Average activity level and activity variance are also signiﬁ-
cantly reduced due to laboratory-imposed restrictions on the
subjects activity (Fig. 1).

When the same subject is studied in different protocols, we
ﬁnd large differences in the probability distributions (Fig. 2).
For example, during wakefulness greater values of activity
occur most frequently during the daily routine, intermediate
activity values occur during the forced desynchrony, and the
highest frequency of low activity values is seen during the
constant routine (Fig. 2a).
Indeed, the largest activity val-
ues encountered during the constant routine protocol are ap-
proximately two orders of magnitude less frequent than sim-
ilar activity values encountered in the daily routine protocol.
We also ﬁnd major differences between individuals in the dis-
tribution of activity values during the daily routine protocol
(Fig. 2b). Such differences are expected given their differ-
ent daily schedules, environments, and reactions to random
events. However, by appropriately rescaling the distributions
of activity values on both axes to account for differences in

FIG. 1: Independent contributors to the complex dynmaics of hu-
man activity, depicted at the top of the ﬁgure, include: 1(cid:13) reaction to
extrinsic random events, 2(cid:13) scheduled activities and, 3(cid:13) intrinsic fac-
tors, notably the endogenous circadian pacemaker which inﬂuences
the sleep/wake cycle. Our ﬁndings of scale-invariant activity patterns
(Figs. 2, 3) indicate a heretofore-unidentiﬁed intrinsic multi-scale
control of human activity 4(cid:13), which is independent of other extrinsic
and intrinsic factors such as 1(cid:13), 2(cid:13), and 3(cid:13). The second panel illus-
trates an actual one-week recording of human activity [3] during the
daily routine protocol. Data structure highlights a 24-h sleep/wake
periodic change in the mean activity — lowest during sleep (ﬁlled
bars). The third panel, expanding a 16-h section of wakefulness, also
shows patches of high and low average activity levels with apparent
erratic ﬂuctuations at various time scales. The bottom left panel is
an activity recording from the same subject during the constant rou-
tine protocol with much lower average activity values compared to
daily routine. The clear 2-h cycle is a result of scheduled labora-
tory events. The bottom right panel shows activity levels in the same
subject during the forced desynchrony protocol. Of note here is the
28-h sleep/wake cycle as opposed to the 24-h rhythm in activity data
during the daily routine.

average activity level and standard deviation [5], we ﬁnd a
remarkable similarity in the shapes of the probability distri-
butions for all three protocols (Figs. 2c, 2e), and for all indi-
viduals when in the same protocol (Fig. 2d). The existence of
a universal form of the probability distribution, independent
of activity level in all individuals and in all protocols, sug-
gests that a common underlying mechanism may account for
the overall distribution of activity.

This probability distribution when plotted on a log-log scale
reveals different characteristics above and below a distinct
crossover point (Fig. 2e). At scales above the crossover ac-
tivity level there is pronounced non-Gaussian tail (Fig. 2e).
This tail on the log-log plot represents a power-law form, in-
dicating an intrinsic self-similar structure for a range of ac-

tivity values. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the observed shape of
the rescaled probability distribution remains unchanged when
the data series are reanalyzed using a variety of observation
windows ranging from 15 s to 6 min (Fig. 2f). This stability
of the probability distribution over a range of time scales in-
dicates that the underlying dynamic mechanisms controlling
the activity have similar statistical properties on different time
scales. Statistical self-similarity is a deﬁning characteristic of
fractal objects and is reminiscent of a wide class of physical
systems with universal scaling properties. Our ﬁnding of a
universal form of the probability distribution raises the possi-
bility of an intrinsic mechanism that inﬂuences activity values
in a self-similar “fractal” manner, that is unrelated to the indi-
vidual’s daily and weekly schedules, reactions to the environ-
ment, the average level of activity, the phase of the circadian
pacemaker, and the time scale of observation.

We next perform power spectral analyses for all three proto-
cols to determine whether there exist any systematic intrinsic
ultradian rhythms of activity with periods of less than 24 h du-
ration [2, 6]. The data for each individual exhibit occasional
peaks in the daily routine protocol for periods ranging from 30

FIG. 3: Power spectrum and correlation analyses of activity data
during wakefulness. (a) Group average power spectral densities for
all three protocols. For better clarity and to avoid overlap, curves
are vertically offset. To present graphs on a common x-axis, power
spectra are shown with decreasing frequency from left to right. The
spectral density peaks for the simulated scheduled activity data rep-
resenting controlled scheduled events during the protocol (bottom
curve) match the peaks observed in the original human activity data
recorded during the forced desynchrony protocol. This analysis sug-
gests that the observed peaks in the power spectrum cannot be at-
tributed to endogenous ultradian rhythms. (b) DFA scaling of ac-

min to 4 h. However, we ﬁnd no systematic ultradian rhythms
within individuals from week to week, and no systematic ul-
tradian rhythms in the group average for the daily routine pro-
tocol (Fig. 3a). The only systematic rhythms that are ostensi-
bly in the ultradian range which emerge in the group data are
at 4 h during the forced desynchrony protocol (with harmonics
at 2 h and 80 min) and at 2 h during the constant routine pro-
tocol (with harmonics at 1 h and 30 min) (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3a).
These peaks are caused by the controlled scheduled activities
in the laboratory and are extrinsic to the body as they also oc-
cur in simulated scheduled activity data that assumes speciﬁc
activity values for each scheduled behavior imposed through-
out the laboratory protocols (Fig. 3a). Thus, we ﬁnd no evi-
dence of systematic intrinsic ultradian rhythms in our data.

To provide further insight into the dynamic control of ac-
tivity, we next examine the temporal organization in the ﬂuc-
tuations in activity values. We perform detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (DFA) which quantiﬁes correlations in the activity
ﬂuctuations after accounting for nonstationarity in the data by
subtracting underlying polynomial trends. The DFA method
quantiﬁes the root mean square ﬂuctuations, F (n), of a sig-
nal at different time scales n. Power-law functional form,
F (n) ∼ nα, indicates self-similarity (fractal scaling). The
parameter α, called the scaling exponent, quantiﬁes the corre-
lation properties in the signal: if α=0.5, there is no correlation
(random noise); if α < 0.5, the signal is anticorrelated, where
large activity values are more likely to be followed by small
activity values; if α > 0.5, there are positive correlations,
where large activity values are more likely to be followed by
large activity values (and vice versa for small activity values).
Figure 3b shows that F (n) for a typical subject during
wakefulness exhibits a power-law form over time scales from
≈ 1 min to ≈ 4 h. We ﬁnd that the scaling exponent α is
virtually identical for records obtained during the ﬁrst week
of daily routine (α = 0.92 ± 0.04, mean ± standard deviation
among subjects), the second week (α = 0.92 ± 0.06) of the
daily routine, the constant routine protocol (α = 0.88 ± 0.05),
and the forced desynchrony protocol (α = 0.92 ± 0.03). The
value of α ≈ 0.9 for all protocols and all individuals in-
dicates that activity ﬂuctuations are characterized by strong
long-range positive correlations. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that
this scaling behavior is not caused by the scheduled activi-
ties because simulated scheduled activity data that are gener-
ated by assigning a speciﬁc activity value for each scheduled
event throughout the laboratory protocols yields an exponent
of α = 1.5 (Fig. 3b), which represents random-walk type be-
havior. These results suggest that the activity ﬂuctuations are
not a consequence of random events (in which case α would
be 0.5) or scheduled events, but rather relate to an underlying
mechanism of activity control with stable fractal-like features
over a wide range of time scales from minutes to hours. Since
mean activity levels and the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations are
greatly reduced in the laboratory during the constant routine
and forced desynchrony protocols (Fig. 1), we obtain smaller
values of F (n) (downward shift of the lines in Fig. 3b). How-
ever there is no change in the scaling exponent α. Similarly,

the scaling exponents for the daily routine protocol are inde-
pendent of the average activity levels of the different subjects
(Fig. 3d), and of the mean activity level on different days of
the week, indicating that this newly-found scaling pattern of
activity appears to be an intrinsic feature.

To test for the presence of nonlinear properties of the data,
we analyze the “magnitude series” formed by taking the ab-
solute values of the increments between consecutive activity
values [7]. Again, from detrended ﬂuctuation analysis of this
series, we ﬁnd practically identical scaling exponents, αmag,
for all three protocols, despite large differences in mean ac-
tivity levels between protocols (Fig 3c). Moreover, all indi-
viduals have very similar values of the scaling exponent αmag
(Fig. 3d), which are not systematically changed by the proto-
col. For the group, during the ﬁrst week of daily routine, we
ﬁnd αmag = 0.78 ± 0.06 (mean ± standard deviation among
subjects), during the second week αmag = 0.76 ± 0.05, dur-
ing the constant routine protocol αmag = 0.82 ± 0.05, and
during the forced desynchrony protocol αmag = 0.80 ± 0.04.
Since αmag ≈ 0.8(> 0.5), there are positive long-range cor-
relations in the magnitude series of activity increments, indi-
cating the existence of nonlinear properties related to Fourier
phase interactions (Fig. 3c) [7, 8]. To conﬁrm that the ob-
served positive correlations in the magnitude series indeed
represent nonlinear features in the activity data, we do the fol-
lowing test: we generate a surrogate time series by performing
a Fourier transform on the activity recording from the same
subject during daily routine as in Fig.3b, preserving the am-
plitudes of the Fourier transform but randomizing the phases,
and then performing an inverse Fourier transform. This proce-
dure eliminates nonlinearities, preserving only the linear fea-
tures of the original activity recording such as the power spec-
trum and correlations. Thus, the new surrogate signal has the
same scaling behavior with α = 0.93 (Fig. 3b) as the original
activity recording; however, it exhibits uncorrelated behavior
for the magnitude series (αmag = 0.5) (Fig. 3c). Our results
show that the human activity data contains important phase
correlations which are canceled in the surrogate signal by the
randomization of the Fourier phases, and that these correla-
tions do not exist in the simulated scheduled activity. Further,
our tests indicate that these nonlinear features are related to
Fourier phase interactions, suggesting an intrinsic nonlinear
mechanism [8]. The similar value of αmag for all three proto-
cols and all individuals, which is different from αmag = 0.5
obtained for the simulated scheduled activity and for the phase
randomized data, conﬁrms that the intrinsic dynamics pos-
sess nonlinear features that are independent of the daily and
weekly schedules, reaction to the environment, the average
level of activity, and the phase of the circadian pacemaker.

The consistency of our results among individuals, and for
different protocols, suggests that there exist previously unrec-

4

ognized complex dynamic patterns of human activity that are
unrelated to extrinsic factors or to the average level of activity.
We also showed these patterns to be independent of known
intrinsic factors related to the circadian and to any ultradian
rhythms. Notably, (i) these patterns are unchanged when ob-
tained at different phases of the circadian pacemaker; (ii) we
do not observe systematic intrinsic ultradian rhythms in activ-
ity among subjects in the daily routine experiment; (iii) im-
posing strong extrinsic ultradian rhythms at 4 h and 2 h in the
laboratory protocols did not change the fractal scaling expo-
nents α or αmag or the form of the probability distribution;
and (iv) we ﬁnd consistent results over a wide range of time
scales. Together, these ﬁndings strongly suggest that our re-
sults are unlikely to be a reﬂection of the basic rest activity
cycles or ultradian rhythms. We attribute these novel scale-
invariant patterns to a robust intrinsic multi-scale mechanism
of regulation (Fig. 1). This regulatory mechanism presents a
new challenge to understand nonlinear control of human mo-
tor activity and pathways of interaction with other physiologic
dynamics such as heart rate, gait [9], ﬁnger tapping [10], hu-
man sway and muscle ﬂuctuations [11].

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

In this paper, we investigate two major immunization strategies, random immunization and tar-
geted immunization, of the susceptible-infected (SI) Model on the Barab´asi-Albert (BA) networks.
For the heterogenous structure, the random strategy is quite ineﬀective if the vaccinated proportion
is quite small, while the targeted one which prefers to vaccinate the individuals with the largest
degree can sharply depress the epidemic spreading even only a small amount of population are
vaccinated. The analytical solution is also obtained,which can capture the trend of velocity change
versus the amount of vaccinated population.

INTRODUCTION

Epidemic dynamics, one of the attracting problems in
both biological and physical communities, aims at ex-
plaining the dynamical processes of disease spreading,
computer virus prevailing, and so on. The previous in-
vestigations based on the diﬀerential equations are al-
ways under the assumption of both homogeneous infec-
tivity and homogeneous connectivity of each individual
[1, 2]. Therefore, if denote the possible contacts, along
which the infection spreads, by edges, then the previ-
ous studies mainly concentrated on the epidemic dynam-
ics on complete or random networks. However, against
the above assumption, the empirical data of real net-
works indicate the universal existence of heterogeneous
topologies [3, 4, 5]. One intriguing ﬁnding is that many
real networks have approximately power-law degree dis-
tributions, that is to say, the probability distribution
function of degree, P (k), approximately obeys the form
k−γ, with 2 < γ < 3. This kind of distribu-
P (k)
tion implies an unexpected abundance of vertices with
very large degrees, i.e., the so-called “hubs” or “super-
spreaders”. This series of networks, named scale-free
(SF) networks, attract many researchers to investigate
the corresponding epidemic behaviors (see the review pa-
per [6] and the references therein).

∼

The most exemplary models in this ﬁeld, having
been extensively lucubrated, are the susceptible-infected-
susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR)
models. The recent works about SIS [7, 8] and SIR [9, 10]
models on SF networks present us with completely new
epidemic propagation scenarios that a highly heteroge-
neous structure will lead to the absence of any epidemic
threshold. However, many real epidemic processes can-
not be properly described by the above two models. In
this paper, we especially focus on the onset dynamics of
epidemic outbreaks, whose behavior is governed by the
pure prevalence without the natural recovery or remov-
ing. That is to say, a speeding time-scale is much smaller

∗Electronic address: zhutou@ustc.edu

In the real world, when
than the recovery time-scale.
the speed of the disease is so drastic that the eﬀect of
recovery and death can be ignored, it is the identical pro-
cess with above one. In addition, in some broadcasting
processes, each node is in the possession of two discrete
state: received or unreceived. Diﬀerent from the SIS or
SIR model, the ones having received signals will not alter
back to the state unreceived. Hence, it is more proper
to utilize the so-called susceptible-infected (SI) model to
describe those dynamic processes, in which the infected
nodes stay infected and spread the infection to the sus-
ceptible neighbors with rate λ.

Very recently, Barth´elemy et al.

[11, 12] studied the
SI model in Barab´asi-Albert (BA) networks [13], and
found that this epidemic process has an inﬁnite spread-
ing velocity in the limit of inﬁnite population. Following
a similar process on random Apollonian networks and
weighted scale-free networks, Zhou et al.
investigated
the eﬀects of clustering [14] and weight distribution [15]
on SI epidemics. By using the theory of branching pro-
cesses, V´azquez obtained a more accurate solution about
the time behavior of SI model [16]. The SI model with
identical infectivity, which leads to a slower spreading in
SF networks than the standard model, has recently been
investigated by Zhou et al.
[17]. And the geographi-
cal eﬀect on SI model is studied by Xu et al.
[18, 19].
Although these previous works are very helpful to the
deeply understanding of SI epidemic, compared with the
extensively studied SIR and SIS models, the SI model has
not been carefully investigated thus far. Especially, the
immunization eﬀect on SI dynamics, which is very im-
portant for controlling the prevalence, has not yet been
investigated. In this paper, we focus on the immunization
eﬀect of SI model on SF networks, which can be consid-
ered as a complementary work of the previous studies on
the immunization of SIR and SIS models.

II. THE MODEL

In the standard network SI model, each individual is
represented by a node of the network and the edges are
the connections between individuals along which the in-

The four plots exhibit the time evolution of i(t) for diﬀerent
spreading rates λ in normal (a) and single-log (b) coordinates,
and for diﬀerent minimal degree m in normal (c) and single-
log (d) coordinates, respectively. The numerical simulations
are implemented based on the BA network of size N = 5000.
In plots (a) and (b), the average degree of BA networks is
ﬁxed as hki = 6, and in the plots (c) and (d), the spreading
rate is ﬁxed as λ = 0.001. The legends in panels (a) and (b)
denote the diﬀerent spreading rates, and the legends in panels
(c) and (d) denote the diﬀerent minimal degrees. All the data
are averaged over 1000 independent runs.

crete states, either susceptible or infected. The infection
transmission is deﬁned by the spreading rate λ at which
each susceptible individual acquires the infection from an
infected neighbor during one time step.

Using the mean-ﬁeld theory, the reaction rate equa-

tions can be written as [11, 12]:

In Fig. 1, we report the simulation results about the
time evolution of infected density with initially one ran-
domly selected node to be infected. All the simulations
are implemented on the BA networks [13], which can
be constructed by continuously adding one node with m

edges connected to the existing nodes relying on the prob-
ability proportional to their degrees. The advantage with
the BA model is that it is the mostly studied and lacks
structural-biases such as none-zero degree-degree corre-
lations. Clearly, the epidemic spreading if very fast, and
in the early stage, i(t) follows an exponential form.

III.

IMMUNIZATION EFFECT

Immunity is a practical controlling strategy to the
prevalence of the disease. The most extensively investi-
gated approaches is the so-called mass vaccination [1, 20]
(or called random immunization). In random immuniza-
tion, a fraction f of the whole population is randomly
selected to be vaccinated in advance. The most signiﬁ-
cant problem is that whether it is eﬀective for the highly
heterogeneous networks? In the previous works, by using
the mean-ﬁeld theory and branch process theory, Callway
et al. [21] and Cohen et al. [22], separately but almost at
the same time, both proved that the random immuniza-
tion is of less eﬀectivity for SIR model on SF networks.
In Fig. 2, we plot the time evolution of infected density
i(t) for diﬀerent immunization range f , which is deﬁned
as the fraction of population being selected to be vac-
cinated. From Fig. 2, one can ﬁnd that the spreading
velocity has almost no change if only a very few individ-
uals are selected to be vaccinated. Therefore, similar to
the situations for SIR model, the random immunization
is of less eﬀectivity for SI model on SF networks.

Other than the random immunization, if the degree of
each node is known, one recently proposed eﬃcient im-
munization strategy is the so-called targeted immuniza-
tion [23, 24], which means to vaccinate the nodes with the
largest degrees ﬁrst. Fig. 3 shows the eﬀect of targeted
immunization for diﬀerent f . The spreading velocity re-
markably decreases even only a small fraction, f = 0.001,
of population get vaccinated, which strongly indicates the
eﬃciency of the targeted immunization. From Fig. 3(b),
it is observed that the time scale governing the epidemic
behavior in the early stage sharply changes even only
10−3 fraction of population (i.e. ﬁve nodes) are vacci-
nated.

Consider a scale-free network of size N , the degree dis-
tribution, P (k) = Ak−γ, obeys the following normalized
condition

where A is a normalized constant, M the maximal de-
gree and m the minimal degree. We assume after the
fraction f of population with largest degrees having been
vaccinated, the maximal degree decreases to kc(f ), and
if f is suﬃciently small so that the degree distribution
still obeys a power-law form with exponent γ almost un-
changed, then

exponential form i(t) = i(0)eτ (f )t, where i(0) = 1/N is
the initial infected density. The time scale τ (f ) can be

the ﬁtting value of γ in ﬁnite size BA networks is smaller
than 3.0, which will lead to a even broader distribution
k−3 thus a faster spreading than the theo-
than P (k)
retical prediction. We have obtained the average ﬁtting
value of γ as γ

rations of BA networks with N = 10000 and m = 3.

the assumption that the degree distribution still obeys a
power-law form with same exponent after the removal of
N f hub nodes will not be valid, resulting in the observed
departure.

IV. CONCLUSION

As an important branch of the studies on epidemic
spreading, immunity never loses its attraction. Some
striking conclusion somewhat changes our opinions about
epidemic. However, despite of the well-studied SIS and
SIR model, the immunization eﬀect on the outbreaks of
epidemic spreading, of signiﬁcantly practical value, has
not been carefully investigated thus far. The purpose of
this paper is to provide a complementary work of the
previous studies on the immunization of SIR and SIS
models.

Two major immunity strategies are investigated based
on the BA networks. The random immunization is of less
eﬀectivity while the targeted immunization can sharply
depress the spreading velocity even only a very few hun
nodes are vaccinated. Furthermore, the analytical results
is obtained which agree with the simulation well for suf-
ﬁciently small immunization fraction.

Abstrat

A wide range of organisms use iradian loks to keep internal sense

of daily time and regulate their behavior aordingly. Most of these loks

use intraellular geneti networks based on positive and negative regulatory

elements. The integration of these (cid:16)iruits(cid:17) at the ellular level imposes

strong onstraints on their funtioning and design. Here we study a reently

proposed model [N. Barkai and S. Leibler, Nature, 403:267(cid:21)268, 2000℄ that

inorporates just the essential elements found experimentally. We show that

this type of osillator is driven mainly by two elements: the onentration

of a repressor protein and the dynamis of an ativator protein forming an

inative omplex with the repressor. Thus the lok does not need to rely on

mRNA dynamis to osillate, whih makes it espeially resistant to (cid:29)utua-

tions. Osillations an be present even when the time average of the number

of mRNA moleules goes below one. Under some onditions, this osilla-

tor is not only resistant to but paradoxially also enhaned by the intrinsi

biohemial noise.

The environment hanges in a highly periodi manner. There are, among

others, daily yles of light and dark as well as annual yles of hanging

limates and physial onditions. Suh environmental periodiity may reate

the neessity for organisms to develop internal time-keeping mehanisms to

aurately antiipate these external hanges and modify their state aord-

ingly [1℄. In partiular, a wide range of organisms, as diverse as yanobateria

and mammals, have evolved iradian rhythms (cid:22)biologial loks with a pe-

riod of about twenty four hours that evoke and regulate physiologial and

biohemial hanges to best suit di(cid:27)erent times of the day.

Reent (cid:28)ndings show that the moleular mehanisms upon whih these

loks rely share many ommon features among speies [2℄. The main hara-

teristi is the presene of intraellular transription regulation networks with

a set of lok elements that give rise to stable osillations in gene expres-

sion. A positive element ativates genes oupled to the iradian lok. It

simultaneously promotes the expression of a negative element, whih in turn

represses the positive element. The yle ompletes itself upon degradation

of the negative element and re-expression of the positive element.

A ruial feature of iradian loks is the ability to maintain a onstant

period over a wide range of internal and external (cid:29)utuations [1℄. Suh ro-

bustness ensures that the lok runs aurately and triggers the expression

of lok-dependent genes at the appropriate time of the day. For instane,

(cid:29)utuations in temperature a(cid:27)et hemial reation rates and may perturb

osillatory behavior. Another soure of (cid:29)utuations may be the presene of

3

internal noise due to the stohasti nature of hemial reations [3℄. Low

numbers of moleules may be responsible for random (cid:29)utuations that an

destabilize the osillatory behavior of the biohemial network [4℄. Yet, ir-

adian loks maintain a fairly onstant period amidst suh (cid:29)utuations.

Desription of the model

To study possible strategies, or priniples, that biologial systems may use

to minimize the e(cid:27)et of stohasti noise on iradian loks, we examine a

minimal model based on the ommon positive and negative ontrol elements

found experimentally [3℄. This model is desribed in Figure 1. It involves two

genes, an ativator A and a repressor R, whih are transribed into mRNA

and subsequently translated into protein. The ativator A binds to the A

and R promoters, whih inreases their transription rate. Thus, A ats as

the positive element in transription, whereas R ats as the negative element

by sequestering the ativator.

The deterministi dynamis of the model is given by the set of reation

This simple model is not intended to reprodue the partiular details of eah

organism but to grasp the properties that the ore design onfers. As in any

general model, the parameters of the values we use are typial ones. For

instane, the rates for bimoleular reations are all in the range of di(cid:27)usion

limited reations.

The preeding equations would be stritly valid in a well-stirred maro-

sopi reator. At the ellular level, a more realisti approah has to on-

sider the intrinsi stohastiity of hemial reations [5℄. This an be done

by transforming the reation rates into probability transition rates and on-

entrations into number of moleules. One then obtains the so-alled master

5

equation whih gives the time evolution of the probability of having a given

number of moleules. There is no general proedure to solve this type of

equation analytially, but it is the starting point to simulate the stohasti

behavior of the system. The basi idea behind suh simulations is to perform

a random walk through the possible states of the system, whih are de(cid:28)ned

by the numbers of moleules of the di(cid:27)erent reating speies. Starting from

a state with given numbers of moleules, the probability of jumping to other

state with di(cid:27)erent numbers of moleules (i.e. the probability for an elemen-

tary reation to happen) an be omputed from the master equation. One

an pik up a state and the jumping time aording to that probability dis-

tribution, then onsider the resulting state as a new initial state, and repeat

this proedure until some (cid:28)nal state or time is reahed. In this way, the num-

bers of moleules hange in time with the statistial properties given by the

master equation. There are several algorithms to implement this. The main

di(cid:27)erene among them is the spei(cid:28) way in whih they ompute the prob-

abilities and selet the states. For hemial reations with few omponents,

it is ustomary to use the so-alled Gillespie algorithm [6℄.

This intrinsi probabilisti behavior in the evolution of the number of

moleules gives rise to (cid:29)utuations that are usually referred to as noise. In

general, the term noise is used for any disturbane interfering with a sig-

nal or with the operation of system. In the ase of hemial reations, the

signal would be the average prodution of the reating speies whereas the

disturbane would arise as a onsequene of the (cid:29)utuations around that av-

6

erage value. We use term noise rather than (cid:29)utuations to emphasize the

disturbing e(cid:27)et that these (cid:29)utuations an have. Thus, although related,

both terms do not mean the same. For instane, there an be large (cid:29)utua-

tions in some moleular speies but, if their harateristi time is very short

ompared to those of other proesses that take plae, they would introdue

little noise.

In Figure 2 we ompare the results of the stohasti and deterministi

approahes. We show the levels of A protein and R protein over time for

the set of parameter values and initial onditions given in the aption of Fig-

ure 1. The deterministi results were obtained from numerial integration of

Eqs. (1), whereas the stohasti results were obtained by omputer simulation

using the Gillespie algorithm. The main di(cid:27)erene between the determinis-

ti and stohasti time ourses is the presene of random (cid:29)utuations in the

latter. In the deterministi model every iradian yle is idential to the

previous one. The stohasti model shows some variability in the numbers

of moleules and the period length, orresponding to the intrinsi (cid:29)utua-

tions of the biohemial network. For these values of the parameters, both

stohasti and deterministi approahes give similar results. We have also

used di(cid:27)erent initial onditions and in all the ases we have observed that

the behavior of the long term solution is the same.

Model simpli(cid:28)ation

To gain further insight into the essential elements that are responsible for the

7

osillations, we will simplify as muh as possible the deterministi rate equa-

tions. By making various quasi-steady state assumptions [7℄, it is possible to

simplify the set of Eqs. (1) into a two variable system with the repressor R

and the omplex C as the two slow variables:

=

q

with ρ(R) = βA/δMA(γCR + δA) and Kd = θA/γA . Notie that the nonlin-

earity in the equations enters trough the quasi-equilibrium value of A,

A(R),

whih is a funtion of R. The main idea behind these approximations is that

e

there are fast and slow variables. Fast variables are assumed to be at an

e(cid:27)etive equilibrium whereas slow variables are responsible for the dynam-

is of the system. Thus, given the set of Eqs. (1), we assume that all the

derivatives exept dR/dt and dC/dt are zero.

In Figure 3 we show that for the values of the parameters we use the

numerial solutions for the tra jetories of the two-variable system [Eqs. (2)℄

agree losely with the solutions of the full system [Eqs. (1)℄, exept for quan-

8

titative di(cid:27)erenes in the peak levels and times at the beginning of eah

yle. These di(cid:27)erenes arise beause the time sale separation between fast

and slow variables is not su(cid:30)iently large for quasi-steady state assumptions

to be exat. These results indiate, nevertheless, that the dynamis of the

system is mainly determined by two omponent onentrations: those of the

omplex and the repressor. The other omponents are driven mainly by these

two elements and their e(cid:27)ets enter the system through e(cid:27)etive parameters.

It is worth emphasizing that the redued two-variable model is aimed just

to o(cid:27)er insights into the qualitative behavior of the system and to show how

the properties that one observes in the full system are already present in a

simple two variable model. Thus, whenever we present simulation results for

the deterministi system, exept if otherwise stated, we are referring to the

full system. Regarding the validity of the two-variable model, it is a good

approximation when the dynamis of mRNA and the ativator is faster than

that of the omplex and repressor. For instane, it will remain valid if δR is

dereased or some of δA , δMA , δMR , θA , and θR are inreased with respet to

the parameters of the aption for Figure 1.

Limit yle osillations and stability analysis

The existene of osillations in the two-variable system an be inferred from

appliation of the Poinaré-Bendixson theorem [8℄. This theorem states that

a two-dimensional system of the type we are onsidering exhibits limit yles

if it is on(cid:28)ned in a losed bounded region that does not ontain any stable

9

(cid:28)xed points. The tra jetory of the system is on(cid:28)ned sine the number of

moleules annot reah in(cid:28)nite values. The (cid:28)xed points and their stability

an be determined by following a standard linear stability analysis. There is

a single (cid:28)xed point for positive onentrations. In our ase, the signs of the

real parts of the eigenvalues of the matrix desribing the linearized dynamis

around this point are given by

where τ is the trae of the matrix. All the quantities are evaluated at the

(cid:28)xed point (R0, C0). When τ is positive, the real part of the eigenvalues is

positive, the (cid:28)xed point is unstable, and there is a limit yle in the system,

whih gives su(cid:30)ient onditions for the existene of osillations. Evaluation

of Eq. (3) shows that τ is indeed positive for the set of parameters we are

using. The domain in whih τ is positive is rather broad. For instane, the

funtion τ remains positive when θA and θR are multiplied by a fator K with

0.024 < K < 10.7; when all transription rates (α and α′

) are multiplied by K

with K > 0.08; or when protein and mRNA degradation rates are multiplied

by K with 0.0009 < K < 3.5. When τ is negative, the (cid:28)xed point is stable

and, in priniple, no onlusion about the existene of limit yles an be

drawn. In this ase, the presene of osillations ould also depend on the

initial onditions. For the full model, the ranges of parameters that give rise

to osillations are not exatly the same but remain very lose to the previous

10

The mehanism responsible for osillations is illustrated in Figure 4 through

the phase portrait of the two-variable model. Starting with low numbers of

initial moleules near the origin of the phase plane, the tra jetory rapidly

shoots upwards along the

˙R = 0 nullline (the dot over a variable means its

time derivative). Here, the high levels of A, present due to auto-ativated

transription, rapidly indue the formation of the omplex C . Reahing the

maximum of the nullline, the tra jetory `falls o(cid:27) ' the edge and moves rapidly

diagonally right and downwards, orresponding to a drop in C and a rise in

R. The tra jetory urves around the

˙R = 0 nullline and hits the

˙C = 0

nullline, where it slowly returns to the left and approahes the (cid:28)xed point

(R0, C0). When approahing the (cid:28)xed point,

˙R dereases sharply, taking the

tra jetory past the (cid:28)xed point and sending it bak upwards to initiate a new

ones.

yle.

The tra jetory in Figure 4 omprises a fast phase orresponding to the

rapid prodution of C and R, and a slow phase orresponding to the slow

degradation of R. These two distint phases are harateristi of exitable

systems, the lassi example of whih is the Fitz Hugh-Nagumo model for

ation potential transmission in neurons [9, 10℄. The fast and slow leg or-

respond to the exitable and refratory phase of the system, respetively.

Thus, the system osillates as it avoids the (cid:28)xed point (R0, C0) and hits the

˙R = 0 nullline on the left to begin the exitable phase of a new yle.

As we have already pointed out, the deterministi analysis an be useful

11

to grasp the main properties of the system under ertain onditions. Unfortu-

nately suh onditions are not known a priori without a stohasti analysis.

Surprisingly enough, we have found that parameter values that give rise to

a stable steady state in the deterministi limit ontinue to produe reliable

osillations in the stohasti ase, as shown in Figure 5. Therefore, the pres-

ene of noise not only hanges the behavior of the system by adding more

disorder, but an also lead to marked qualitative di(cid:27)erenes.

How an the system ontinue to produe osillations even when deter-

ministi rate equations predit a stable steady state? The system always

evolves towards a stable (cid:28)xed point, as skethed in Figure 6. However, a

perturbation of su(cid:30)ient magnitude near the (cid:28)xed point, e.g. as illustrated

by the dotted arrow in Figure 6 (notie that the (cid:28)gure has not been drawn to

sale and that the size of the arrow is not representative of the atual size of

the perturbation), may initiate a new yle. For low numbers of moleules,

the intrinsi (cid:29)utuations of hemial reations an be large enough to ontin-

ually send the system into the fast phase after eah yle and thus produe

sustained osillations. In the deterministi limit (or lose to it), there are

no perturbations (or the perturbations are too small) to initiate a new yle

and the tra jetory stays lose to the (cid:28)xed point. In this ase, the system

performs better if enough noise is present in the system. This situation is

analogous to that observed in the Fitz Hugh(cid:21)Nagumo model, where an op-

timal amount of noise maximizes the reliability of the osillations [11℄.

It

is important to realize that the e(cid:27)ets that noise may have on non-linear

12

systems an be di(cid:30)ult to predit and rather paradoxial [12℄. Therefore,

the smaller number of moleules does not neessarily imply more irregular

behavior of the system, as one might intuitively assume [4, 13℄.

Signi(cid:28)ant parameters and noise resistane

The mehanism responsible for osillations involves only two variables. This

has some important onsequenes for the funtioning of the lok.

If we

onsider the deterministi limit, a two-dimensional dynamial system of this

type either osillates regularly or does not osillate at all. In two dimensions,

sine tra jetories annot ross, (cid:28)xed points and periodi orbits are the only

possible attrators. Other more ompliated behaviors suh as haos or quasi

periodiity are not allowed [8℄. On the other hand, the intrinsi stohasti

(cid:29)utuations of the remaining variables are e(cid:27)etively averaged and do not

signi(cid:28)antly a(cid:27)et the performane of the system.

For instane, one variable that usually plays a prominent role in many

iradian rhythm models is the number of mRNA moleules [14℄.

In our

ase, however, mRNA does not enter diretly into the dynamis. It is just an

intermediate step in the prodution of the proteins. Thus, if protein produ-

tion remains unaltered the system will osillate regardless of the number of

mRNA moleules involved. This an be ahieved, for instane, by inreasing

simultaneously the degradation rates of mRNA and the translation rate of

the proteins. In the deterministi limit of the two-variable model this has

no e(cid:27)et on protein dynamis at all. In the stohasti ase the e(cid:27)ets are

13

negligible. Figure 7 shows the time evolution of repressor mRNA and protein

levels in the system for βA , βR , δMA and δMR multiplied by a fator of hun-

dred. The system essentially alternates between having zero and one mRNA

moleule in the yle, and the proteins ontinue to exhibit remarkably good

osillations.

There are also parameters that do a(cid:27)et the properties of the osillations.

In the deterministi limit, osillations are always regular (provided that the

two-variable model is a good approximation). When (cid:29)utuations are taken

into aount, the reliability of the osillations may depend on those param-

eters. One suh parameter, as we have seen in the previous setion, is the

repressor degradation rate δR . This parameter a(cid:27)ets the period of the os-

illations (ompare e.g. Figures 2 and 5) and also the stability of the (cid:28)xed

point. One an infer from Eq. (3) that for high or low values of δR the (cid:28)xed

point beomes stable. In suh ases, the deterministi system stops osillat-

ing but this does not need to be so for the stohasti one, whih may ontinue

produing reliable osillations.

Notie that the positive feedbak is a key element in the lok dynamis.

Its most obvious use is the generation of the instability that gives rise to

osillations. But it has other not so obvious role that is losely related to the

resistane to noise. In general, gene regulation is a slow proess (with typial

harateristi times of about one hour) and, as a suh, is prone to be a(cid:27)eted

by (cid:29)utuations. This problem gets even worse if the dynamis relies in several

oupled transriptional feedbaks sine the e(cid:27)ets of the (cid:29)utuations are then

14

ampli(cid:28)ed. The positive feedbak gives a fast transriptional swith, allowing

to move fast from low to high transription rates. In this way, the time in

Conlusions

The presene of noise in transriptional and enzymati networks is a funda-

mental onsequene of the stohasti nature of biohemial reations. The

ability to funtion e(cid:27)etively and onsistently amidst suh random (cid:29)utu-

ations is a ma jor issue in gene expression and network behavior.

In this

paper we have studied how di(cid:27)erent fators a(cid:27)et a simple model for ira-

dian rhythms that exhibits noise resistane. We found that the osillations

in this model are driven mainly by two omponents: a repressor protein and

an ativator-repressor omplex. This fat is responsible for the reliability of

the osillations. First, a two-dimensional dynamial system of this kind has

a very simple behavior: in the deterministi limit, it either osillates or goes

to a steady state. Seond, noise and perturbations in the other variables

a(cid:27)et the system only slightly sine they do not enter diretly the dynam-

is. Finally, resistane to noise is ahieved as the number of moleules of

any of the two key omponents reahes small values only for short periods of

time or when they are not driving the dynamis of the system. In this way,

even though some moleular speies may be present in very low numbers, the

intrinsi stohastiity of biohemial reations an be bypassed.

It is important to emphasize that organisms have evolved networks to

15

funtion in the extremely noisy ellular environment. Suitable network de-

signs, as those that are now emerging from the experimental data [3, 15℄, an

onfer resistane against suh noise. In addition, some of these networks may

not only be resistant to but ould also be taking advantage of the ellular

noise to perform their funtions under onditions in whih it would not be

possible by deterministi means.

A

and DA denote the number of ativator genes with and without A bound

to its promoter respetively; similarly, D′

R and DR refer to the repressor

promoter; MA and MR denote mRNA of A and R; A and R orrespond to

the ativator and repressor proteins; and C to the the inativated omplex

formed by A and R. The onstants α and α′

denote the basal and ativated

rates of transription, β the rates of translation, δ the rates of spontaneous

degradation, γ the rates of binding of A to other omponents, and θ the

rates of unbinding of A from those omponents. Exept if otherwise stated,

are DA = DR = 1 mol, D′

A = D′

R = MA = MR = A = R = C = 0, whih

require that the ell has a single opy of the ativator and repressor genes:

DA + D′

A = 1 mol and DR + D′

R = 1 mol. The ellular volume is assumed to

be the unity so that onentrations and number of moleules are equivalent.

Notie that we assume that the omplex breaks into R due to the degradation

of A and therefore the parameter δA appears twie in the model.

˙R ≡ dR/dt = 0 and

Motivated by recent experiments on DNA torsion-force-extension characteristics we consider the
writhing geometry of open stiﬀ molecules. We exhibit a cyclic motion which allows arbitrarily large
twisting of the end of a molecule via an activated process. This process is suppressed for forces larger
than femto-Newtons which allows us to show that experiments are sensitive to a generalization of the
C˘alug˘areanu-White formula for the writhe. Using numerical methods we compare this formulation
of the writhe with recent analytic calculations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recent experiments in which DNA molecules are ma-
nipulated [1, 2, 3] with the help of magnetic beads
have led to a renewed interest in the statistical me-
chanical properties of the torsionally stiﬀ wormlike chain
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In the experiments a bead is attached to
the end of a long DNA molecule; the other end remains
stuck to a surface. The bead is held in a magnetic trap
which allows the simultaneous application of a force, F
and couple, Γ; one measures the mean distance of the
bead from the surface as a function of F and Γ. In an
ingenious theoretical paper it was shown [8] that the sta-
tistical mechanics of this problem are related to the prob-
lem of a quantum particle in a magnetic ﬁeld. However,
a crucial assumption was made in the formulation of the
writhing geometry of the polymer.

The concept of writhe was originally deﬁned in the
context of studies on closed ribbons where it forms one
part of a topological invariant, the linking number [9, 10].
In this paper we show how the writhe can be usefully
generalized to study the geometry (and the mechanical
response functions) of open DNA molecules. This gener-
alization introduces end corrections to the C˘alug˘areanu-
White formula for the writhe. We then perform simula-
tions for the writhe distribution of an open chain which
we compare with the analytic theories. We show that
experiments involving manipulation of DNA with beads
in unconﬁned geometries have unbounded ﬂuctuations in
the measured torsional angle. Under an exterior torque
a bead can rotate an arbitrarily large angle. When the
DNA is under tension this rotation is an activated pro-
cess with jumps of 4π in the mean angle.

Contrary to the calculation performed by Bouchiat
and M´ezard [8] we ﬁnd that this unbounded response is
not removed by the introduction of an intermediate cut
oﬀ. However applications of tensions larger than femto-
Newtons suﬃce to render the problem ﬁnite in practice
[11]. We ﬁnd that their regularized expressions strongly
overestimate the magnitude of writhe ﬂuctuations for
tensions larger than femto-Newtons.

In order to interpret experiments in which the molecule
is under strong tension Moroz and Nelson used a Monge
representation to perform a calculation of writhe ﬂuctua-
tions [6]. We numerically investigate the validity of their

results. We show that a strong correction to scaling can
be expected due to the formation of rare loops, which give
however exceptionally large contributions to the writhe.
We ﬁnd that the window of forces in which simple an-
alytic theories, based on the Monge representation, are
valid is rather small.

In single molecule experiments, self-avoidance conﬁnes
the polymer to a single invariant knot. Analytic theories
are unable to estimate the error in writhe due to sum-
ming over both knotted and unknotted conﬁgurations.
We investigate this question numerically.

II. WRITHE AND LINKING NUMBER

A. Closed curves

The linking number

k of a closed ribbon is an integer
topological invariant [9, 10]. It can be decomposed into
two parts the twist,

w and the writhe,

r:

This decomposition is useful because the writhe is a func-
tion of the centerline r(s) of the ribbon.

that the writhe of a stiﬀ polymer is closely related to the
geometric anholonomies discovered by Berry [15] in wave
phenomena.

Equation (2) has a simple geometric interpretation[16].
The projected path of a chain on a plane with normal u
can intersect itself. Each crossing is assigned a number,
1, according to the handedness of the intersection. The
±
sum of these numbers n(u) is the writhe number for direc-
tion u and the expression, eq. (2), is equal to the average
of n(u) over all directions.

B. Bead rotation is given by an extended deﬁnition
of writhe

The above deﬁnition of the writhe, with its emphasis
on it being part of a topological invariant hides, to some
degree, the interpretation of χC as an angle of rotation in
many experimental situations. We shall now show that
an extended deﬁnition of the writhe, based on equation
(2) is the writhe contribution to the bead rotation that
is measured in DNA twisting experiments. Rather simi-
lar arguments have also been given in [7] for a polymer
between two planes, we give hear an extended derivation
to point out the exact limits of the result.

Consider the planar ribbon in ﬁgure 1. The linking

number,

k, is zero thus

We shall use this closed ribbon as a reference conﬁgu-

which is
using the geometry of ﬁgure 2. The polymer

mental rotation angle is given by the χC for the extended
construct with the two straight line sections extending to
inﬁnity [31].

Consider generating an ensemble of chains with some
arbitrary algorithm. The distribution of the conﬁgura-
tions of the chains is independent of the dynamic process
creating them if they are subject to Boltzmann statistics.
If we now choose unknotted conﬁgurations and demand
that they be created via a process which preserves the
linking number we conclude that we can uniquely deter-
mine the rotation angle from the writhe of the extended
construct. A crucial part of this argument is the restric-
tion of the construct of ﬁgure 2 to the sector
k = 0.
We discuss the importance of this restriction in the next
section.

In the deformation from ﬁgure 1 to ﬁgure 2 we wish
k. To do so we must
to conserve the linking number
ﬁrstly forbid self crossing of the polymer conﬁguration.
In any experiment with DNA in the absence of topology
changing enzymes this restriction in reasonable. However
this condition is insuﬃcient to conserve the topology of
the entire construction. We must also forbid the cross-
ing of the real polymer with the imaginary line from the
end of the chain to inﬁnity. In a recent numerical paper
[7] this was achieved by grafting the ends of the polymer
to an external surface rather than beads. Experimen-
tally we would stop this crossing by introducing a steric
hindrance: A ﬁne ﬁber in the neighborhood of the manip-
ulating bead would work perfectly. We show below, how-
ever, that even this level of steric hindrance is not needed
in the experiments as they are presently performed.

If the chain is allowed to bend back in such a way that
is passes through the line to inﬁnity there is a discon-

2. This allows one to construct a
cycle of motions in which the shape of the ﬁlament un-
dergoes a cycle coming exactly back to its original shape
while the bead undergoes a rotation of 4π about the ver-
tical axis, ﬁgure 3. This result is the origin of a common
amphitheater demonstration of the importance of spinor
representations of the rotation group: If one holds a plate
horizontally in the palm of one’s hand one can spin it
about a vertical axis by performing a suitable contortion
of the arm. Against all intuition the plate can be turned
an arbitrarily large angle. Photographs of Feynman per-
forming this demonstration are to be found in [17]. Each
cycle of the arm again gives rise to a rotation of 4π of
the plate.

This unbounded torsional ﬂuctuation is an activated
process: When the DNA is under tension the bead moves

3

against the magnetic force a distance comparable to its
diameter in order to force a loop over the point of at-
tachment. For micron sized beads this introduces a char-
acteristic scale of the force of kBT /µm
fN. For forces
of more than a few femto-Newtons the process is expo-
nentially rare and suppressed. The natural time scale for
attempts at crossing the barrier is given by the Zimm
d3η/kBT with d the bead size,
time of the bead τ
which is seconds.

∼

This force is extremely low,

the widely studied
crossover from random coil to semiﬂexible behavior in
the force-length characteristics of DNA occur at a force
53nm the persistence length
scale of kBT /ℓp with ℓp ≈
of DNA. This intrinsic force scale for DNA much higher
than that which is needed to conserve linking number
with a 1µm bead. We conclude that most experiments
with tense DNA are performed in a regime where a high
energy barrier leads to conservation of the linking num-
ber of the construct of ﬁgure 2. However, there is always
a small probability of passage by this barrier so that un-
der torsion the true steady state of a DNA molecule is
a state of cyclic motion in which the bead rotates by a
series of activated jumps.

Because of these considerations we assume that all
topological invariants are conserved during experiments,
including linking number and the knot conﬁguration of
the extended construct of ﬁgure 2.

D. Analytic expressions for the extended writhe

From the above discussion we are lead to the calcu-
lation of the writhe of the extended construct, ﬁgure 2.
The double integral, eq. (2), on the interior of the chain
is identical to that commonly used for closed DNA, we
denote the corresponding angle by χint.

The integral from one point on the linear extension to
inﬁnity plus the second point on the polymer can be sim-
pliﬁed as follows: The integral is evaluated by noticing
that it is the spherical area, swept out by the vector

as s and s′ vary. Consider, now, a chain, r(s). Place
the origin at r(0). Let us now place s in the interior of
the polymer and s′ on the extension of the polymer to
inﬁnity which is directed in the direction ˆez. Consider,
now, s′ = 0. The curve ˆu(s) = ˆe(s, 0) is a spherical
curve. As we now let s′ vary from 0 to inﬁnity we sweep
out the area between ˆu and the point ˆez. This spherical
area can be written as

then χC = χend+χint. A similar result has been found [8]
by direct integration of eq. (2). We are rather remarkably

ﬂuctuations. We convert eq. (7) to spherical coordinates

E. Twisting

Experiments are sensitive to the sum of the writhing
and twisting ﬂuctuations in a polymer. If we now allow
the excitation of the torsional modes in the polymer of
ﬁgure 2 the total rotation between the two ends is the
sum of the writhing angle χC and rotation due to in-
ternally excited twisting motions. In order to compare
the twisting ﬂuctuations to writhing ﬂuctuations, we de-
ﬁne ℓt = C/kBT the torsional length, where C is the
torsional modulus [8]. This twisting mode is unmodiﬁed
by the writhing geometry, at least in the simplest models
of DNA elasticity. The mean square twisting angle, χT
is given by

III. ARTEFACTS IN THE FULLER
FORMULATION OF WRITHE

Recent analytic work [6, 8] has been based on the sim-
pliﬁed formulation of eq. (3). It is much easier to treat
analytically than the full double integral in equation (2)
due to a direct mapping onto quantum mechanics: The
bending energy of a stiﬀ beam in the slender body ap-
proximation of elasticity is given by

The sum for the partition function is clearly closely re-
lated to path integrals studied in quantum mechanics.
Formally the energy in eq. (9) looks like the kinetic en-
ergy of a free particle moving on a sphere. From the sum
of paths in equation (10) one derives a Fokker-Planck
equation which is entirely analogous to the Schroedinger
equation for a particle on a sphere:

∂P (t, s)

2 is the Laplacian operator on the sphere. Here
where
P (t, s) is the probability of ﬁnding the chain oriented in
the direction t at the point s. As a function of s the
vector t “diﬀuses” with diﬀusion coeﬃcient which varies
as 1/ℓp.

Let us now consider the writhe calculated with Fuller’s
formula for such “diﬀusing” paths. There is a singularity
in equation (3) near t =
ˆez. In the neighborhood of
−
this direction the integral measures twice the winding of
ˆez. The winding of
the random walk about the point
a random walk has singular properties in the two dimen-
sional plane and on a sphere [18]. In particular there is
logarithmic divergence in the winding properties in the
continuum limit.
It is this winding number divergence
that was picked up in the analytic calculation of [8] and
necessitated an intermediate scale cut oﬀ in the calcula-
tion.

−

One of the principle conclusions of this paper is that
these winding number singularities are not present in the
distribution of the writhe determined experimentally: As
shown above in the case of constrained linking number it
is the C˘alug˘areanu-White expression for the writhe which
gives the exact twisting angle. The Fuller expression dif-
fers by an arbitrary factor of 4nπ due to the winding
number singularities not present in the original formu-
lation. We shall demonstrate numerically that it is the
passage from (2) to (3) which introduces these singular-
ities. Use of (3) will be shown to lead to a substantial
error in the calculation of χC with an overestimate by a
factor of 2.5 for a discretization corresponding to DNA.

IV. NUMERICAL METHODS

Given the diﬃculty of treating the full C˘alug˘areanu-
White expression for the writhe analytically we decided
to proceed by numerical exploration of the distributions
of writhe implied by the C˘alug˘areanu-White and Fuller
formalisms.
In particular we look for the Cauchy tail
predicted analytically [8] in the writhe distribution func-
tion. The existence of such a tail implies the absence
of a reasonable continuum limit of the wormlike chain
and continuous evolution of the response functions as a
function of a microscopic cut oﬀ. We shall conclude that
the C˘alug˘areanu-White formulation remains ﬁnite even
in the continuum limit.

In our numerical investigations we shall be particularly
interested in the ﬂuctuations in the writhe of the open
chain, as a function of the tension. Due to the algorithm
used in generating the chains we are unable to generate
chains in an ensemble with an imposed torsional couple.
Our results are thus always for Γ = 0. The torsional
ﬂuctuation are, as usual, related to the linear response of
the chain via the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem.

A. Numerical Calculation of Writhe

A number of methods are available for the calculation
of the writhe of a discretized polymer [19]. We calculate
the discretized versions of the integrals of eq. (2) and
equation (3) by recognizing that they are both areas on
In the Fuller formulation it is the area

enclosed by the curve t(s). For the discretize chain the
tangent curve becomes a series of link directions, ti, cor-
responding to points on a sphere. One connects these
points by geodesics and then sum over the area of the
triangles formed by two successive tangent vectors and
ˆez.

is the area of the spherical triangle deﬁned by

We have already noted that the full expression, eq. (2)
corresponds to the area swept out by ˆe(s, s′). For two
links forming a discrete chain this deﬁnes a spherical rect-
angle. We calculate its area by decomposing it into two
spherical triangles.

In both calculations we calculate the area of a spherical

triangle by using l’Huilier’s expression

(13)

where, a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of a spherical
triangle. For our purposes the triangle has to be oriented,
the area can be either positive or negative.

A useful cross check in the programming is that for
any polymer the modulo relation of eq. (4) must be sat-
isﬁed despite very diﬀerent intermediate results in the
calculation. Numerically we found that the equality held
to within 10−10, when working in double precision when
the extended C˘alug˘areanu-White deﬁnition of writhe was
compared with the Fuller formulation.

Since the double integral of equation (2) is reduced to
a double summation this step takes O(N 2) operations
for a chain of N links. For the long chains studied in our
simulations it is by far the slowest step in the calculation.

B. Link Sector Choice

The generation of long unknotted chains is numeri-
cally diﬃcult; In our simulations we used an ensemble of
chains with only the constraint
k = 0 which, as shown
above, is the minimum constraint needed for unbounded
torsional response. Our result can then be directly com-
pared with existing analytic theories which do not impose
any topological constraints.

L

The ensemble of

k = 0 chains may contain knots.
While this ensemble may appear physically “unreason-
able” one must not forget that knots are rare in the chains
that we shall study. It has been noted [20] that for a ﬂex-
ible chain unknotted conﬁgurations dominate the statis-
tics of chains even several hundred Kuhn lengths long.
For the chain lengths that we work with in this paper
the contamination coming from such knotted conﬁgura-
tions should be weak. At the end of the paper we present
a partial investigation of the inﬂuence of knots. We ﬁnd
that they do not modify our conclusions as to the nature
of the continuum limit for writhing chains. The errors
due to the use of a knotted ensemble are much smaller
than the diﬀerences between the Fuller and C˘alug˘areanu-
White formulation of the writhe.

C. Chain generation

In order to use the expressions for the writhe given
above we are interested in chains in which the initial
and ﬁnal tangents are parallel (though the writhe for
non parallel conﬁgurations does have a simple general-
ization [14]) but for which there is no constraint on the
ﬁnal position of the chain. Rather than using a conven-
tional Monte-Carlo algorithm to generate chains we used
a simple “growth algorithm”.

1. Zero force

∼

p

We wish to grow chains of length L, persistence length
ℓp using a series of links of length b. In the absence of
tension we generate chains by starting from a single link
in the ˆez direction at the origin. We then successively
add links to the chain with small random angle incre-
ment α0
b/ℓp to produce a single realization of an
equilibrated semiﬂexible chain. It is almost certain that
this chain does not satisfy the boundary conditions on
the tangent thus we continue growing until the ﬁnal tan-
gent is parallel to the initial tangent to within an angle
small compared with α0. We keep the polymer in our en-
semble if the length of the polymer is less than 1.05
L,
otherwise the whole conﬁguration is rejected and the pro-
cess restarted from the ﬁrst link. The conﬁgurations are
then used to calculate the writhing distributions. The
curves that we generate are somewhat “imperfect” since
they are due to a mixture of lengths. This admixture of
chain lengths plays no role, however, in our analysis of
the asymptotic distribution of writhe. There is no self
avoidance in this code; it can be shown from a Flory ar-
gument that self avoidance is a weak eﬀect in semiﬂexible
chains of moderate length.

FLEXIBLE CHAINS

In the presence of an external force the algorithm is
slightly more complicated. We proceed by noting that
the partition function of a chain under tension can be
expressed in a very similar manner to the partition func-
tion of a ﬂexible polymer in an external potential [21].

where θ is the angle between the direction of the force
and the local tangent to the polymer, and f = F/kBT .
Z(s, θ) corresponds the number of conﬁgurations in
which the chain points in the direction θ after a distance
s.

As proposed in [22] we introduce a pool of several chains
which we grow simultaneously. As each link is added
there is angular diﬀusion as described above and a sec-
ond process of birth or death of chains in the pool in
order to account for the force. If f cos(θ) is positive then
it is considered to be a growth rate for reproduction of

stochastically destroyed with the appropriate probabil-
ity. We also manage the total pool size as in [22]. At the
end of a pool growth, we destroy the chains that do not
satisfy the condition for the tangent vector to be parallel
to within α0 at both extremities.

There are several sources of error possible with the al-
gorithm. The most diﬃcult to evaluate is the eﬀect of the
ﬁnite pool size. The result of a single run is an ensem-
ble of several conﬁgurations together with a total weight
coming from the management of the pool size. For suf-
ﬁciently large pool sizes this weight is the same for each
realization of the growth process. For small pool sizes,
however, this weight undergoes important ﬂuctuations.
To calculate a correlation function from an ensemble of
pools we chose to select a single chain from each pool and
performed a simple average over at least 10, 000 pools.
Since we had no, a priory method of estimating errors
from this procedure we experimented with the pool size
for several diﬀerent values of the force. We found that
even when varying the pools size from as low as 20 chains
to 2000 chains the estimates of the mean square writhe
were stable within a few per cent. In our production runs
we chose a value of 50 chains per pool. An alternative
procedure would weight each pool according to the true
variation of the total weight of each simulation.

A systematic diﬀerence between a discretized chain
and a continuous curve also occurs. Our principle aim
is to understand experiments on DNA[1, 2] therefore we
choose ℓp = 53 nm. We chose for b the half pitch of a
30b. This is also com-
single helix, 1.8 nm, yielding ℓp ≃
parable to the diameter of the molecule. In order to study
the convergence of the writhe to the continuum limit we
shall also perform some simulations with ℓp/b
30 (see
section VI C).

Before presenting our numerical results on semiﬂexi-
ble chains we wish to explore the scaling behavior of the
writhe of a polymer described as a freely jointed chain
with N links. This allows us to understand the length
scales and the structures which are important in deter-
mining the writhe of a long molecule. Many of these
results are already known for closed chains however we
wish to demonstrate that the end corrections in eq. (7)
are subdominant in the limit of very long chains.

A. Scaling arguments for ﬂexible chains

We shall start with the interpretation of the writhe as a
signed area swept out by the vector ˆe(s, s′): Consider two
links i and j of length a separated by a distance Rij . This

This integral converges at large distances, but is diver-
gent at small distances. We conclude that the writhe in-
tegral is dominated by the cut oﬀ scale a. For a semiﬂex-
ible polymer the cut–oﬀ a corresponds to the persistence
length ℓp.
It is thus the structure at this length scale
which dominates the writhe of the molecule. The aver-
age crossing number is deﬁned in a very similar manner
to the writhe except the unsigned area
is summed
over rather than the signed area. This has a non-zero
mean and scales in the following way in a Gaussian poly-

Finally, eq. (7), the end correction to the writhe is a

come sensitive to structure at short wavelengths in the
polymer. Thus from eq. (17) and eq. (19) the end correc-
tions remain small for long chains and are subdominant,

Given the importance of this end correction in the in-
terpretation of the experiments we now present a more
rigorous study of the end correction and conﬁrm its sub-

B. Magnitude of End Corrections

In order to further study the scaling behavior of the
end corrections we examine the limit L/ℓp large. We thus
study the problem of a freely jointed chain rather than
the semiﬂexible chain and disprove arguments of [24] that
the dominant singularities in the writhe of a semiﬂexible
chain come from ends due to the formal analogies be-
tween eq. (3) and eq. (7). Numerical results (not shown
here) on semiﬂexible chains lead to the same conclusions.
Let us now make a hypothesis that the asymptotics of
χend are dominated by the largest contributions to the
integrand of eq. (8) then

where L is the length of chain and ℓp the persistence

lem is regularized by the stiﬀness of the chain, ℓp.

To check this hypothesis (and to improve on the very
rough scaling analysis given above, eq. (19)) we gener-
ated, ﬁgure 4, a large number of random walks for a
freely jointed chain. We then plot
as a func-
tion of log L and look for a straight line. We conclude
that the end corrections to the writhe are comparable to

VI. WRITHE DISTRIBUTION OF

A. Short Molecules

For short ﬁlaments of length L

ℓp the distribution of
writhe calculated with the extended C˘alug˘areanu-White
formula and the Fuller formula are indistinguishable; am-
biguities due to winding about the pole are exponentially
rare. The writhe distribution of a open polymer with par-
1 is given
allel tangents at each end in the limit L/ℓp ≪
by the L´evy [14, 25] formula for the distribution of the
area enclosed by random walk in a plane

and tends slowly to 3. However, there is a large peak
around L/ℓp = 2. The very strong non-monotonic be-
havior in ﬁgure 5 bottom is most striking; we shall now
explain the origin of this feature.

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

·

Let’s call back-facing segments the sections of the chain
along which t
ˆez < 0. We deﬁne, nS, the number of
such segments for a chain. If we compute ρ4 with only
conﬁgurations for which nS = 0 the peak disappears. We
understand that the peak is due to the formation of loops
in the chain which can, sometimes, completely dominate
the writhing properties of a chain. Such important fea-
ture in the distribution are clearly missed in any Monge
description of a chain.

From these simulations, we also estimated the coeﬃ-
and L/ℓp for
cient of proportionality K between
very long chains when the distribution of writhe has con-
verged to a Gaussian:

the coeﬃcient is similar in magnitude to that found [26,
27] for closed chains, even though our model for the chain
is somewhat diﬀerent.

C. Convergence of the writhe distribution

−

In order to characterize the asymptotic distribution of
the writhe, and study the importance of the Cauchy tail
in Fuller formulation, we have performed simulations on
a series of chains of length L = 8ℓp. With chains of this
length knots remain rather rare whilst the energetic bar-
rier needed for a chain oriented in the direction ˆez to wind
ˆez is only a few kBT . We are thus
about the direction
sensitive to the winding singularities of the Fuller formu-
lation. In our simulations we vary the discretization so
that there are L/ℓp = 10, 30, 100, 300, 900, 2700 links
per persistence length and we generate 200000 indepen-
dent conﬁgurations for each value of L/ellp. We plot the
variance of χF and χC as a function of the discretization
in ﬁgure 6. We observe a continuous evolution showing a
logarithmic divergence for the Fuller formulated writhe,
and a convergence to a stable value for the C˘alug˘areanu-
White form for quite moderate values of L/ℓp. The ratio

very low tensions justify the use of a conserved linking

presence of external forces.

To estimate the writhe of a molecule at low forces we

at the scale ℓp. Under low tensile forces the structure of
a polymer is unchanged out to a length scale ℓf = 1/f .

We conclude that under low tension, when ℓf ≫
writhe of a molecule becomes independent of its degree
of elongation and thus the tension, f .
It is only un-
der the highest forces when the semiﬂexible nature of
the molecule is sampled that we see an evolution of the
writhe with force.

To validate our code for generating tense molecules we
performed a series of simulations with a chain of per-
sistence length ℓp = 250b, results are shown on ﬁgure 7

(25)

(26)

using the Fuller expression for the writhe. At high forces
we see that the curves converge towards the law eq. (26)
and that at low forces the curves saturate as expected
from the above scaling argument. Somewhat surprising
however is the rapid crossover which occurs for forces
comparable to f
1. In the neigh-
1/ℓp when L/ℓp ≫
borhood of this force there is a pronounced “shoulder” on
the curve. Convergence to the long chain limit is rather
60ℓp that we see a saturation
slow. It is not until L
in writhing curves. This slow convergence can be under-
stood rather easily by noting that any chain within ℓp
of the surface of the polymer coil is in a region of lower
than average density.

∼

∼

We have performed a series of simulations on diﬀer-
ent levels of discretization of the polymers. We ﬁnd that
as the discretization becomes coarser the large shoulder
dominates over the law in 1/√f for the mean square
writhe. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 8 where we use 30
links per persistence length for the discrete chain. The
chain of length L = ℓp still displays a regime in agreement
with eq. (26). However with longer chains the regime in
1/√f is overwhelmed by the crossover to the low tension
regime. Eq. (26) substantially underestimates the writhe
ﬂuctuations in the domain out to f ℓp = 10 correspond-
ing to very large forces of
1 pN . At such forces other
∼
corrections come into play, including the chiral nature of
the DNA chain.

It is interesting to note that the Fuller formulation
gives results which are useful over a larger window of
forces. The Fuller and C˘alug˘areanu-White curves are
2; analytic calcu-
very similar down to tensions f ℓp ∼
lations based on the Fuller formulation can be expected
to be useful for tensions larger than 0.2 pN . At very
low forces the ﬂuctuations are rather diﬀerent. The ratio

for subsets with nS ﬁxed. The results

until now leads to an ensemble containing both knotted
and unknotted chains, even if
k = 0. We now present
a preliminary investigation on the inﬂuence of knots on
the distribution of writhe. This question is related to the
problem of the closure of the chain: If the polymer is
allowed to pass through the line to inﬁnity, a knot may
appear, change or disappear. We thus continue with the
assumption that the tension of the DNA is suﬃciently
high that the extended construct of ﬁgure 2 remains in
the same state throughout an experiment.

×

1)

In order to select the knotted chains, we have com-
puted the Jones polynomial V [28, 29]. The choice of
the Jones polynomial is justiﬁed by the Jones conjecture,
that is VK = 1 if and only if K is the trivial knot. We
have used the algorithm of Kauﬀman [29, 30] to calculate
VK and perform the classiﬁcation of chains in function of
their knots. Recently it has been noted that probabil-
ity of knot formation is small [20] in short chains. Our
simulations conﬁrm this point :
for chains of 8 persis-
tence lengths the proportion of knotted chain is around
(5

10−4 when f = 0.

±
To interpret a micromanipulation experiment one
should perform averages over an ensemble of chains with
the same given knot. In practice one hopes the experi-
ment is performed with the trivial knot. The probabil-
ity distribution of the writhe angle χC has to be mod-
iﬁed, because we do not count the knotted conﬁgura-

For the usual bead sizes and forces used in the experi-
ments this barrier is very high and the extended linking
number is conserved. This allows the use of an extended
C˘alug˘areanu-White formalism in the calculation of the
bead rotations. We ﬁnd that the Fuller and C˘alug˘areanu-
White formulae give substantially diﬀerent distribution
functions for the torsional ﬂuctuations due to writhe. In
contrast to Bouchiat et al. we ﬁnd that the topologi-
cally conﬁned DNA chain does not need an intermediate
scale cut oﬀ to render the response functions ﬁnite. The
mathematical problems as to existence of the torsional
response functions occur at long wavelengths; imposing
a short wavelength cut oﬀ is the wrong solution to this
problem.

we studied of L = 80ℓp. The correction increases the
disagreement between calculations based on Fuller’s for-
mulation of the writhe and the experimental curves. It
is particularly instructive to compare ﬁgure 10 and ﬁg-
ure 6 for the case L/ℓp = 8. Removing knots from the
ensemble of chains has a negligible eﬀect on the writhe
for such short chains, however even for the most coarsely
discretized chains with ℓp/b = 10 the ratio
C i
is larger than 2. We have also studied the evolution of
this correction with the force. The correction decreases
rapidly with the force and is found to be zero for forces
F ℓp larger than a few kBT .

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have shown that the standard ex-
perimental geometry does not torsionally conﬁne a DNA

≫

In experiments we expect several distinct regimes when
working with beads of size d
ℓp. For very low forces,
F < kBT /d torsional ﬂuctuations are unbounded and it
is not possible to deﬁne the torsion-force-extension char-
acteristics. In the regime kBT /d < F < kBT /ℓp torsional
ﬂuctuations are bounded but must be calculated using
the full double integral representation of the writhe. The
Fuller formulation, even with an additional cut oﬀ, sub-
stantially overestimates the writhe contribution to the
kBT a simple theory
torsional response. When F ℓp ∼
based on a Monge representation expanded to quadratic
order is unable to ﬁt the data due to strong corrections
to scaling; here an expression based on the Fuller for-
mula can be expected to give a better description of the
response. Finally, for very large forces, F
kBT /ℓp, the
C˘alug˘areanu-White and Fuller formulae give the same
result, however other eﬀects which are neglected here be-
come important; a full theory must treat the chiral nature
of DNA and force induced denaturation.

that the writhe is a conformal invariant for which the ad-

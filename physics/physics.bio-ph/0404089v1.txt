ABSTRACT

The problem of biped locomotion at steady speeds is discussed through the Lagrangian

formulation developed for velocity-dependent, body driving forces. Human walking on a

level surface is analyzed in terms of the data on the resultant ground-reaction force and

the external work. It is shown that the trajectory of the human center of mass is due to a

superposition of its rectilinear motion with a given speed V and a backward rotation along

a shortened hypocycloid. A stiﬀ-to-compliant crossover between walking gaits is established

at mid speeds, which separate slow walking from fast walking, limited by Vmax = 3.4 m/s.

Key words: locomotion, bipedalism, human, biomechanics, walking.

In biology, many fundamental discoveries come from studies of animal movement. In-

tegrative approach to the locomotion of animals in physiology focuses on the interaction

between the muscular, tendon and skeletal body subsystems and the environment. Walking

and running are examples of the simplest biped locomotion presented by humans, primates,

and ground-dwelling birds. An understanding of energy-exchange mechanisms of bipeds,

based on the fundamental principals of mechanics, provides valuable insights into multi-

legged locomotion and even into ﬂying and swimming. [1]

During locomotion, the body system as a whole performs diﬀerent functions. Chemical

energy released by muscles and mechanical elastic energy stored in passive muscles and

tendons are transformed into external and internal work by active muscle ﬁbers, [2] and

is partially lost as a heat. The body-muscle system produces the ground-reaction forces

applied to the animal body. The overall resultant force, including the external gravitational

and the air-resistance forces, as well as the intrinsic-body resistance forces, accelerates and

decelerates the body’s center of mass (COM). This body driving force is therefore involved

in level walking and running, even when the averaged velocity remains constant. Within a

complete step cycle, the body driving force performs certain external work to maintain a

given speed. Studies of the mechanical eﬃciency of animal locomotion at diﬀerent steady

speeds, conducted through the external work and oxygen consumption, provide evidence that

walking is more energetically economical than running. As shown by careful analysis of the

temporal variations for the kinetic and the gravitational energies (see Ref. [3] and references

therein), the recovery of the mechanical energy within one cycle achieves a maximum of

about 70% (at intermediate speeds 5-6 km/h) in human walking that can be compared

with the 2% recovery in human running. [4] This ﬁnding corroborates the old idea that the

dynamics of biped walking can be understood by swings of the ideal pendulum.

Indeed,

the body vaults up and over each leg in an arc in each step, similarly to the inverted plane

pendulum, and the kinetic energy is transformed into gravitational energy when the body

falls forward and downward. The stiﬀ-legged human mechanics of walking modeled by the

compass-arc inverted pendulum is widely employed, [1,3,5] but no means exhaustive. [1,6]

Unlike the swing-pendulum dynamics driven by constant gravitational force, the dynamics of

animal biped walking and quadruped trotting is manifested by body undulations, pulses, and

peristaltic waves [1] produced by the ground-reaction force. In this Letter, we employ the

fundamental principles of classical mechanics to approach to the problem of level locomotion.

At very low speeds, the animal movement is treated through the linear vibrations of the body

near its quasistatic equilibrium given by quiet standing. [7] Nonlinear body motion eﬀects,

controlled by velocity-dependent forces, are taken into account at higher speeds.

All the three components (forward, vertical and lateral) of the resultant force applied by

the body to the ground are measured with a good accuracy by means of the force-platform

technics. [8,9] The force-platform data on human level walking indicates that the lateral

body displacements are relatively small and, thus, the COM motion can be fairly described

by the instant polar vector R(t) deﬁned in the ground coordinate system (see Fig.1). For

walking with a steady speed V , it is convenient to exclude the translational degree of freedom

by introducing the inertial coordinate system through r(t), with x(t) = V t and y(t) = H,

where H is the human height of the body’s COM. In that way, the libration motion is given

by the vector ∆r(t) = R(t) − r(t). The corresponding driving force ∆F(t) can be derived

from the force-platform records. Hence the ground-reaction force F(t) is observed as the

oscillating force near the body weight, thus, F(t) = −mg + ∆F(t). Taking into account that

the muscle-tendon contractions are cyclic in each step, the driving force must satisfy the

steady-motion constraint: < ∆F(t) >c≡ T −1

c

Tc
0 ∆F(t)dt = 0, where Tc(V ) is the one-step

ground-contact period (shown in Fig. 1 for V = 1.1 m/s).

R

Assuming the body’s COM displacements ∆r to be small, we introduce the libra-

tional part of the potential energy ∆U[∆r(t)] in the harmonic approximation: ∆U0 =

k0(∆x2 + ∆y2)/2 through the body stiﬀness coeﬃcient k0(V ). Combining this with the

COM kinetic energy ∆K0 = m(∆

+∆

)/2 and employing Lagrangian formalism, one

deduces the Newton equations m∆

••
r +k0∆r = 0. The free COM motion is therefore due

to a superposition of the two linear oscillations:

∆x0(t) = ∆l0 cos(ω0t −

).

These are solutions ∆r0(t) given by the harmonic amplitudes ∆l0(V ) and ∆h0(V ) and the

one-step angular frequency ω0(V ), with ω0 = 2π/Tc =

k0/m. The obtained in Eq.(1)

backward ellipse rotation of the COM is due to the harmonic part of the observed driving

p

force ∆F0(t) = −k0∆r0, treated as an inertial force. Its components are given by

∆F0x(t) = −mω2

0∆h0 cos(ω0t),

(2)

and shown by solid lines in Fig. 1. The phase relations in Eqs.(1) and (2) are chosen in

accord with the force-time records.

With increase the speed, unharmonious displacements become important and therefore

∆U[∆r(t)] = ∆U0 + ∆U1. Without loss of generality, the unharmonious part of the mechan-

ical potential energy ∆U1 is parametrized in terms of the unharmonious force amplitudes

∆l1 and ∆h1, namely

∆U1(∆r) =

∆x2∆y +

Within the perturbation scheme, the nonlinear forces are deﬁned by the derivatives ∆F1 =

−d∆U1/d∆r taken at ∆r = ∆r0 given in Eq.(1). This results in the reaction-force compo-

nents

Fx(t) = −mω2

0[∆l0 sin(ω0t) + ∆l1 sin(2ω0t)];

Fy(t) = mg + mω2

0[∆h0 cos(ω0t) − ∆h1 cos(2ω0t)].

(4)

The third and the fourth terms in Eq.(3) correspond to the terms of O[cos(2ω0t)] and of

O[sin(2ω0t)], which formally should appear in Fx and Fy, respectively. Both the terms are

omitted in Eqs.(4) because they were not observed in the available data on human walking.

[8,10] Also, the steady-motion constraint provides the force-amplitude relation ∆l0∆l1 =

∆h0∆h1 that is nevertheless violated, even in the case of the small V analyzed in Fig. 1.

As a matter of fact, the theory behind this relation presumes that ∆F1 is a conservative

4

force that disagrees with the experimental data. Below, we extend our consideration for the

driving force.

Let us introduce a generalized (velocity-dependent) potential ∆Uef f (see e.g., Ref. [11])
•
r) = ∆K0 − ∆Uef f and deﬁned as ∆Uef f =

through the librational Lagrangian ∆L(∆r,∆

∆U0+∆U1−∆K1. The last term describes unharmonious kinetic energy (for details, see Ch.5

in Ref. [12]). Within the scope of this consideration, Eqs. (4) are not altered and the steady-

motion constraint is satisﬁed by new kinetic terms. Additionally, we extend the Lagrangian

by Rayleigh’s dissipative function. This introduces the resistance force ∆Fres(t) = −γ ∆

given by the eﬀective frictional coeﬃcient γ(V ). This force is caused by the unharmonious

displacements [13] ∆r1 ≡ ∆r − ∆r0, which obey the following equation:

m∆

r 1 +γ∆

•
r1 +k0∆r1 = ∆F1(t),

with ∆F1(t) is given by the last terms in Eqs. (4). As usual, [11,12] solutions for inhomoge-

neous diﬀerential equations (5) are given by the superposition of the particular solution plus

the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Thus, the desired solution

for the body’s COM motion in the ground coordinate system is given by relations

the steady-motion regimes are established not only by the frequencies, but also by the

Fig. 1. As can be recognized from Eqs. (6), (1) and the force-amplitude ratio, a trajectory

of the human body’s COM, in the moving inertial coordinate system, is a closed orbit

given by a shortened hypocycloid (∆r1 < ∆r0 ≪ H), passing through three turning points

in the backward direction. [14] For qualitative analysis, we describe this close orbit by the

characteristic ellipse, which passes through the same turning points and is introduced by the

axes: ∆l = ∆l0 + ∆l1/3

1 + tan(ϕ)2 and ∆h = ∆h0 + ∆h1/3

1 + tan(ϕ)2 , in the forward

and vertical directions, respectively. One infers that in the ground coordinate system the

p

body’s COM moves on the height H with the speed V , and simultaneously rotates along a

hypocycloid circumscribed by a shrink (or a ﬂatter) ellipse of the eccentricity e+ (or e−). The

latter is obtained with the help of the force-amplitude ratio: e±(V ) =

1 − (∆l1/∆h1)±2 .

p
Next, we show how this eccentricity is related to the body external work.

The step-cycle external work Wtot is performed by the COM to maintain the forward

speed V and to lift-and-lower it around the height H, thus, Wtot = Wf + Wv. This work

can be estimated through the instant power averaged over the cycle period: Wtot(V ) =

the ground-reaction force, produced by active and passive muscles, contribute to the cyclic

work. Bearing in mind the conditions i) of the periodicity of the driving force, ii) of the

orthogonality between the linear and nonlinear displacements, and iii) of the conservatism

of the harmonic force, one deduces that a solely nonzero contribution to Wtot is due to the

unharmonious part of the power

•
W 1 (t) = ∆F1∆

namely

On the one hand, the total external work corresponds to that part of the mechanical

energy which is lost as heat. It must be therefore restored in the next step through chemical

energy by oxygen consumption. On the other hand, the external work is realized through

the positive and negative contributions: Wtot = W + − |W −|. These can be exempliﬁed by

the accelerated and decelerated forward body’s displacements, respectively. A special case is

the ideal oscillational motion, when both the contributions are equal, because all the kinds of

the mechanical energy recover within one cycle. Thus, Wtot = 0 and the recovery coeﬃcient,

deﬁned for arbitrary cyclic motion as r = (W + − Wtot)/W + (see e.g. Ref. [3]), equals one.

To estimate r(V ), we specify the positive work by W +(V ) = Tc < P [

•
W 1 (t)] >c, where the

auxiliary function P (x) = xH(x) is given by the standard Heavyside function H(x). This

introduces the recovery coeﬃcient in the form

obtained with the help of Eqs. (8) and (7). If one employs the human-walk data on ω(exp)

[15] and r(exp)(V ), [3] then Eq.(10) can be read as r(ω(exp)

mass-speciﬁc frictional coeﬃcient (for this analysis see Fig. 2). Also, a straightforward

estimation of the positive work performed in the forward (W +

v ) directions,

yields useful equations for the unharmonious driving-force amplitudes:

As follows from a numerical analysis of Eqs.(11) given in Fig. 3, the instability of the

vertical COM librations occurs at the maximum speed for human walking Vmax = 3.4 m/s.

The eccentricity of the orbit-characteristic ellipses (see Fig. 4) speciﬁes this instability by

the critical condition e−(Vmax) = 1 associated with a dynamical transition from walking to

running. Another kind of instability takes place at the middle speed Vm = 1.7 m/s, which

separates slow walking from fast walking. At this speed, e±(Vm) = 0 and the shrink ellipses

(∆l < ∆h) transform into the ﬂatter ellipses (∆h < ∆l). In reality, the crossover in walking

regimes is attributed to changes in performance of the human legs.

In other words, the

two walking gaits are well distinguished by stiﬀ-legged (∆l < ∆h) and compliant-legged

7

(∆h < ∆l) locomotion that is shown [6] through the distinct body’s postures and reaction-

force records. Moreover, the stiﬀ-legged walk and the compliant walk is associated, [6]

respectively, with a modern human walk and a walk of nonhuman primates. The found

crossover speed Vm is close to the average speed of the so-called ”normal” walking. [6]

In conclusion, we have discussed the problem of animal locomotion on level ground

in view of human data on reaction force and external work for walking at steady speeds.

Application of the standard Lagrangian formalism developed for nonconservative forces,

permits one to introduce a generalized equation for animal locomotion in the point-body-

mass approximation. Such a description involves only integrative properties of animal, given

through the inertial, elastic, and resistance body’s characteristics. Thus, the generalized

equation is expected to be useful for comparative studies of quadruped locomotion where

lateral eﬀects are also negligible. For the case of human walking, the locomotion for the

body’s COM is found as a superposition of the rectilinear motion with its backward rotation

along a shortened hypocycloid.

Records of the ground-reaction force elucidate a variety of functions performed by the

muscle, tendon, and skeletal body subsystems. In animal walking and trotting, this force

acts as a motor-brake force, which additionally supports the body weight and controls stabil-

ity of the forward advancement. The body-support eﬃciency is constrained by anatomical

adaptation of the long-bone limbs for peak-force-ground contacts.

It has been recently

proven, [17] that there is a unique mechanism for the peak-force skeletal adaptation for

all terrestrial mammals. For human walking, the body-support property was employed

when deriving the propulsive force from the reaction-force data. We have deduced that

the velocity-independent forces produce linear harmonic body’s vibrations in the plane of

motion. They are responsible for eﬀective-exchange mechanism of the elastic mechanical en-

ergy, attributed to passive muscles and tendons and implicit in the body stiﬀness coeﬃcient.

The nonlinear unharmonious librations give rise to the forward body’s COM rotation. They

are due to the nonconservative part of the driving force which produce the external work.

The feedback between linear and nonlinear COM librations is revealed through the phase,

8

the amplitude and the frequency constraints imposed on cyclic human walking.

The external work performed by animal body in locomotion is estimated without recourse

to a swing-pendulum or spring-mass modeling. As a result, the slow-to-fast crossover, char-

acteristic to the biped locomotion at intermediate speeds, is shown to arise from the changes

of body-resistance performance and not from the body-elastic adjustment. Finally, the hu-

man maximum speed, stipulated by adaptation to the eﬀective compliant walking, is found

to be Vmax = 3.4 m/s, in accord with the recent experimental data V (exp)

max = 3.2 m/s reported

in Ref. [6].

We apply an improved version of a previously introduced oﬀ-lattice agent-based model to the
steady-state ﬂow equilibrium of skin. The dynamics of cells is determined by conservative and
drag forces, supplemented with delta-correlated random forces. Cellular adjacency is detected by a
weighted Delaunay triangulation. We analyze a simple control mechanism: The cell cycle time of
keratinocytes is controlled by a diﬀusible substance provided by the dermis, in particular we consider
the local water concentration. This concentration is calculated from a diﬀusion equation with time-
dependent boundary conditions and varying diﬀusion coeﬃcients.
It turns out that this simple
control mechanism suﬃces to explain several characteristics of epidermal growth. The dynamics of
a nutrient is also taken into account by a reaction-diﬀusion equation. In addition, we ask the simple
question of how melanoma with decreased basal adhesion manage to persist within the steady-
state ﬂow-equilibrium of the skin. It turns out that there exist physiological parameter sets, where
stochastic eﬀects have important consequences.

INTRODUCTION

In many applications of mathematical modeling, continuum equations are used to describe the evolution of discrete
biological systems such as tumors, epithelia, animal populations [1] etc. However, sometimes discrete eﬀects may
become important [2]. This is especially true when modeling the initial evolution of cancer, which is thought to
originate within a single cell [3]. Within the class of agent-based (individual-based) models, cellular tissues are
modeled as a set of strongly-interacting discrete objects. At present, it seems reasonable to consider the cell as
the smallest entity in these models, though this is not stringent (compare e. g. the extended Potts model [4]). For
agent-based models, the concept of the cellular automaton [5] has proven very useful, since it allows to describe cells
by simple interaction rules. Tumor growth for example has successfully been modeled with cellular automata [6].
However, most of the current agent-based models are implemented on a lattice. In models where a single lattice site is
occupied by a single cell, volume-nonconserving events such as proliferation require far-reaching conﬁguration changes
on the lattice, which comes along with rupture of intercellular bindings on a large scale [7]. This leads to the necessity
of deriving eﬀective interaction rules, which can often not be easily related to physical laws. This problem can be
alleviated as well by allowing for shape ﬂuctuations of cells, either on a lattice with the Potts [4] or the hyphasma
[8] model or oﬀ-lattice with a boundary-based model [9, 10]. The approaches where the dynamics of the boundary
is considered, use a dramatically increased number of dynamic variables and thereby the necessary calculation time
increases. As an advantage however, physically-motivated interactions can be used to calculate the cellular dynamics.
Oﬀ-lattice center-based models [11, 12] allow physical interactions to be included without the disadvantage of the
large number of dynamic variables. Thus, they represent a compromise between speed of numerical calculation and
model accuracy.

We have previously applied an oﬀ-lattice center-based model to multicellular tumor spheroids [13]. In comparison to
continuum approaches [14] it turned out that agent-based models have greater potential to describe realistic biological
systems. Keeping in mind that continuum models also arise from averaging (thereby deleting information), this is
not a big surprise. However, it must be said that the degree of model complexity should always be limited by the
experimental signature and for many experimental signatures continuum models will suﬃce.

In this article, we set up an oﬀ-lattice center-based model that is intrinsically consistent and is also based on physical

interactions as far as possible. This has the advantage that the model can be falsiﬁed.

II. THE EPIDERMIS

2

The epidermis is a stratiﬁed squamous epithelial tissue. It does not contain separate blood vessels and is therefore
dependent on diﬀusion of nutrients from the dermis situated below. The epidermis can be divided into several layers
[15]:

The innermost stratum germinativum or stratum basale (basal layer) is a monolayer, in which most cell divisions
occur. It is separated from the dermis below by a basal membrane, which has a ruﬄed structure at ﬁngers, palms and
soles of feet. A fraction of the cells created there by cell division travels upwards into the stratum spinosum, where
most cells are interconnected by desmosomes, which leads to a spiny cell appearance. Within this layer, the process of
corniﬁcation begins: The cytoplasm looses water and is ﬁlled with keratin ﬁlaments. Within the stratum granulosum,
cells die oﬀ and their shape ﬂattens. This special pathway of cell death is also called anoikis. The stratum lucidum is
a thin layer that is dominantly expressed at hand and feet and functions as a barrier against all possible intruders.
Completely corniﬁed cells mark the stratum corneum, which is clearly distinguishable from the layers below. This
layer does not contain viable cells and constitutes an eﬃcient barrier for water and many solutes. Note that the
thickness of this layer varies strongly for diﬀerent regions of the skin [15]. The upper part of this layer, where the
cellular material detaches by dissolving intercellular contacts, is also called stratum disjunctum.

Within this article, only three layers will be distinguished: The term stratum medium will be used as a combination

for all layers not belonging to the stratum germinativum or the stratum corneum.

The cell types encountered in the epidermis are keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of

these, the dominant fraction is constituted by the keratinocytes with roughly 75000 cells per square mm [16, 17].

Keratinocytes are produced in the stratum germinativum by cell division. In order to maintain epidermal homeosta-
sis, in average one of the two daughter cells must leave the basal layer and travel upwards. The keratinocyte remaining
in the basal layer will be termed stemcell further-on. The cell traveling upwards transforms into a fully-diﬀerentiated
keratinocyte – possibly undergoing transit amplifying proliferations [18] – and reaches the surface after about 12 to
14 days. During this passage, the keratinocytes also follow the process of corniﬁcation.

Melanocytes migrate to the dermis during embryonic development. These dendritic cells are distributed within the
basal layer, and their density is relatively constant between individuals and races with approximately 2000 cells per
square mm [15, 16, 19]. They adhere to the basal membrane via hemi-desmosomes. The purpose of melanocytes is to
produce melanin and to provide it to keratinocytes and hair with their dendrites – the connected cells are also termed
epidermal melanocyte unit [15]. Melanin protects the skin from the ionizing eﬀects of electromagnetic radiation,
and it is accumulated above the keratinocyte nuclei. Diﬀerences in skin color mainly result from diﬀerent levels of
melanin. Tumors arising from cancerous melanocytes are also called melanoma. Since most cancerous melanocytes
still produce melanin, such tumors have a characteristic black color. If they are diagnosed and excised at an early
stage, the prognosis is very good. The prognosis degrades rapidly for melanoma at later stages. Therefore, the early
and secure diagnosis of this disease is a challenging problem.

Langerhans cells are dendritic cells of the immune system. There is evidence that they collect antigens via phago-

cytosis and present them after transforming to dendritic cells in lymph nodes.

Merkel cells are found close to some hair follicles in mammalian epidermis. Though there is no deﬁnite function in

skin known, it is believed that these cells play a role in sensation.

Since neither eﬀects of the immune system nor the mechanisms of sensation will be studied here, the latter two cell

types will not be contained in the in silico representation and will not be discussed further.

The diﬀusional properties of the skin have important implications on medication applied to this tissue. With
an observed strong increase of the manifestation of melanoma [19], studies of melanoma development are of huge
importance. Within this article, some simple related questions will be addressed using an oﬀ-lattice agent-based
approach.

III. THE MODEL

In view of the complicated matter in reality, any model will inevitably simplify the system by neglecting proper-
ties that we consider to be less important. Starting from this perspective, the following approximation may seem
reasonable:

Within the model, cells are represented as adhesively and elastically interacting, compressible spheres of time-
dependent radii. Processes such as cell proliferation and cell death correspond to insertion or removal of spheres to
the system. Similarly, cell growth enters the time-dependent cell radii. In analogy to the cell cycle, the model cells
can assume diﬀerent internal states. In addition, they consume nutrients and their presence changes the diﬀusive
properties within the tissue.

The speciﬁcities and consequences of this paradigm will be examined in detail in the following sections.

A.

Intercellular Contact Model

Already the dynamics of rigid bodies in contact is a diﬃcult problem, as the local geometry at the contact region
will strongly inﬂuence the involved forces. Therefore, most contact models applied in practice are not motivated by
microscopic assumptions but rather mimic the realistic behavior. In principle, for cellular interactions these contact
models all have to fulﬁll two basic conditions

1. they exhibit strong repulsive forces for large deformations,

2. they have a bound state for small deformations.

These conditions are fulﬁlled by a large variety of contact models. For example, the general Lennard-Jones potential
V (x) = Ax−α + Bx−β between two objects placed at ri and rj, where x =
, has been successfully applied in
physics to model the interactions of atoms [20]. Since A, B, α, and β are model parameters, the potential can be ﬁt
to approximate the interaction of other systems such as e. g. grains [21] as well. Note that with a potential ansatz,
viscous eﬀects are not included.

ri −
|

rj|

A model describing viscous and also plasticity eﬀects resulting from dissipative eﬀects of both the extracellular
matrix and the cytoskeleton can be constructed from a mechanical analog: Simple mechanical elements such as the
dashpot and the spring are connected to a mechanical network. These networks then deﬁne a set of linear ordinary
diﬀerential equations, which can be solved to obtain for example the cellular deformation as a function of time,
see e. g. [22, 23]. These models however require a large set of parameters and facing the large uncertainty about
inner-cellular elastic or dampening constants they must be used as ﬁt models. A possible approach would be to
derive the elastic and viscous parameters of such a mechanical network from a microscopic model of the cell. If one
only considers the contribution of the cytoskeleton, a popular approach is the explanation of cellular properties by
tensegrity structures (acronym derived from “tensional integrity”) [24, 25], which can be envisioned as a combination
of rigid elements (usually bars) that are connected by elastic cables. Pressure and tension cooperate to stabilize the
whole structure.

Within this article we have chosen a diﬀerent approach, the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model [26, 27] –
supplemented with viscous forces that are speciﬁed in subsection III C. The JKR-model includes elastic and adhesive
(but non-viscous) interaction of solid spheres and it has been veriﬁed experimentally for soft materials such as rubber.
In addition, it is often used in a biological context to estimate cellular parameters from experimental observations
(JKR-test, [28]). Thus, one can at least on short time scales hope, that even though the parameters derived from
such measurements [29] will not yield a correct description of the cytoskeleton (which is known to be viscoplastic),
their usage in the model will at least lead to dynamics similar to that observed in the experiments.

The characteristics of the JKR contact model relevant for our considerations can be summarized as follows: Two
spheres i and j placed at positions xi and xj, having radii Ri/j , Young moduli Ei/j , Poisson moduli νi/j , and contact
surface energy density σij underlie the interaction force [27]

where aij denotes the radius of the circular contact area between the deformed spheres, Rij the reduced radius, and
Kij incorporates the combined elastic properties

The full JKR-theory has several shortcomings:

1. It is only valid for small deformations hij /Rij ≪

1, since the linear elastic theory assumed in the derivation of
( 1) is not valid for large deformations [31]. In addition, it approximates the cytoskeleton as a homogeneous
solid, which is not the case [28]. Regarding the numerical solution of the interacting particle system, this has
the consequence that some cells may be completely covered by others, since the JKR force ( 4) does not diverge
at complete overlaps. To circumvent this, a modiﬁed interaction potential has been used, which displays this
divergence

if one chooses as matching point xm = 1 and as point for divergence xd = 2 + 2Rmin/Rmax (compare ﬁgure 2).
The choice of this modiﬁed potential only led to signiﬁcantly diﬀerent growth dynamics for
cells if cellular
growth was constrained by static boundaries [36], which indicates that the used drag forces (see section III C)
were small enough to enable fast relaxation.

Illustration of the interaction model. The dynamics of two elastic and adhesive spheres in contact can be described
FIG. 1:
with the JKR-potential. Left: The virtual sphere overlap hij can be calculated from the sphere distance dij = |xi − xj |
and equilibrium radii Ri and Rj. In real-world scenarios, the spheres would evidently deform thus giving rise to a deformed
contact radius aij (not shown). Right: The existence of adhesive forces gives rise to bound states (right, minima at dashed
lines). Their position and depth strongly depends on the parameters σij and Kij . Note that the potential does not diverge at
hij /Rij = 2 + 2Rmin/Rmax (complete overlap). The curves on the right have been computed using the following (physiological)

FIG. 2: Sphere overlaps and modiﬁcation of the interaction potential. Left: Typical contact conﬁgurations corresponding to
special values of the dimensionless sphere distance hij /Rij – for clarity the indices have been dropped. For vanishing virtual
overlap, one obtains h/R = 0, whereas for the case when the center of the smaller sphere is placed exactly on the boundary
of the larger one, one has h/R = 1 + Rmin/Rmax. Complete inclusion of the smaller sphere within the larger one corresponds
to even larger values of h/R. In this regime, JKR theory is not valid anymore. Right: For this reason, the JKR interaction
has been supplemented with a pole at complete sphere overlap. Matching has been performed at hij /Rij = 1, where one has
π(ˆri, ˆrj) = R2

ij. In the physiological regime, the potential is unchanged. Parameters have been chosen as in ﬁgure 1.

2. The JKR-theory does neither include viscous eﬀects arising from the cytoskeleton nor dissipation occurring in
the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the model will be supplemented with additional drag forces, which are
speciﬁed in subsection III C.

3. The original result ( 1) has been derived as a pure two-body interaction [27], which is also the case for its
purely elastic precursor [30, 31]. However, for many adhering spheres already for small individual deformations
additional forces will come into play, since

the spheres are pre-stressed,

the circular contact regions of various cells may overlap.

•

•

Thus, the JKR model does not correctly describe cellular compression for multiple overlaps. The extent of

6

(12)

this shortcoming will critically depend on the current adjacency topology which makes an analytical approach
infeasible. For numerical ease and due to missing estimates in this article the following practitioners approach
has been chosen. Below the target cell volume V target
the cell experiences additional repulsive – isotropic –
forces due to compression of the cytoskeleton. Then, the resulting additional repulsive force acts in the direction
of the neighbors j with magnitude

surface corrections [13] are calculated with the Voronoi tessellation in this article.

4. Whereas the forces in the approximate model ( 4) only depend on the actual relative cellular positions, a more
realistic scenario would have to include hysteresis eﬀects, as adhesive intercellular bonds form after contact
[34]. This however would require to keep track of the time evolution of cellular adjacencies. In part, the time
evolution can be incorporated into the time dependence of the adhesive parameters

also the cytoskeleton reorganizes and thereby the intrinsic cell shape will not remain spherical after contact. A
full description of these eﬀects would therefore not only require time-dependent elastic parameters (Ei, νi), but
also the implementation of a dynamically changing intrinsic equilibrium cell-shape, which is presumably not
within the reach of a center-based model [37].

5. In addition, the derivation of the JKR model relies on the fact that only normal forces act. For cell doublets
with friction, shear forces will in reality exist. It is assumed here that the net eﬀect of shear forces on the validity
of the JKR approach can be neglected, such that they can be independently included in the drag forces.

At least for keratinocytes the application of the JKR model to cell doublet rupture experiments [34] leads to dis-
crepancies between the visual equilibrium distance and the equilibrium distance predicted by the full JKR-model ( 1):
If one derives via equation ( 5) the maximum adhesion energy density from the maximum rupture force recorded
in [34], the resulting equilibrium distance predicted by ( 1) is considerably diﬀerent than observed in the ﬁgures of
the same publication: The indentation hij resulting from equation ( 3) becomes negative (pointing to extrapolation
of JKR theory beyond the region of its validity), whereas for the approximate JKR model, the limiting condition
σij /(KijRij)
1 is certainly violated, which would lead to considerably smaller equilibrium distances (larger inden-
tations) than in reality. For example, for cell-cell contact times smaller than 30 seconds, average rupture forces of
20 nN have been measured [34]. Assuming Kij = 1000 Pa and Rij = 2.5 µm one would thereby ﬁnd from equation
( 5) an adhesion energy density of σmax
0.0017 µN/µm. However, then the equilibrium distances resulting from
equations ( 1) or ( 4), respectively, are inconsistent with the equilibrium distances in [34]. This indicates that the
JKR model is not directly applicable to strongly adhesive cells. For larger times, the discrepancy becomes even worse.
However, we expect that all these shortcomings are not major sources of error if one aims at analyzing control
mechanisms. An improved contact model could generally be included in such simulations, but it should be reasonably
motivated by microscopic theories or experimental data ﬁrst.

B. Random Forces

Due to thermal ﬂuctuations, any particle in a solution will be subject to random forces (Brownian motion). In
addition, some cell types exhibit intrinsic (active) movement which sometimes appear to be of random nature and
thus follow the same mathematics as Brownian motion. For systems with these characteristics, the time-dependent
stochastic forces F (t) modeling the random behavior have to fulﬁll two conditions [38]:

1. their mean vanishes

F (t)
i
h

= 0 and

2. the forces are not correlated, i. e.,

F (t1)
h

F (t2)
i

·

= 3ξ2δ(t1 −

t2).

7

(14)

(15)

The parameter ξ thereby quantiﬁes the strength of the stochastic ﬂuctuations. The movement of single cells in a
solution is highly overdamped [12], and any stochastic force fulﬁlling the above conditions will lead in the Langevin
equation to a diﬀusion-like evolution of cellular distribution, i. e., in the absence of additional forces the squared
displacement will be given by

where D is the corresponding (observed) diﬀusion coeﬃcient and γ is a dampening constant, which eﬀectively describes
the strength of friction. The above identity is also known as the ﬂuctuation dissipation theorem, since it connects
the ﬂuctuations (ξ) with the dissipation (γ).
If this dynamics is observed for free spherical cells in medium, the
friction constant can for highly-damped dynamics be well approximated by the Stokes friction γ0 = 6πηR, where R
represents the radius of the cell and η the viscosity of the surrounding medium. Evidently, with the same random
forces applied, cellular movement will be much smaller if drag forces due to cellular bindings are at work. For numerical
implementations, a stochastic force fulﬁlling the above conditions can be given by [38]

It should be noted however, that active random eucaryotic movement in reality usually occurs with pseudopods
[40]: The cell attaches protrusions to neighboring cells (or the extracellular matrix) and randomly pulls towards them.
This has two further implications

•

•

the stochastic forces become two-body forces, i. e., the neighbor cell that the pseudopod is attached to, is subject
to the corresponding negative force [38]. Also, the forces act into the direction of the normals [41].

Since the pseudopods do not enable pushing, the average stochastic force component into the direction of a
given neighbor cell will not in general vanish. For example, at interfaces of dense tissue (where the pseudopods
ﬁnd resistance) and ﬂuid (where no net force can be generated) one cannot expect the diﬀerent contributions
to compensate.

Since the intrinsic logic behind active cellular movement following Brownian mathematics is not fully understood and
also active movement with pseudopods is not quantiﬁed for the cell types considered in the simulation (keratinocytes
and melanocytes), we have chosen to implement stochastic forces via equation ( 15) as acting randomly on every cell
that react passively to these in return.

C. Equations of Motion

For N cells with positions xi(t) and radii Ri subject to cell-cell as well as cell-medium and cell-substrate interactions,
the equations of motion can in the reference frame of motionless medium and boundaries be summarized as (compare

Note that equation ( 16) should generally be completed by an equation describing the evolution of torque as in [21],
where the kinetics of grains had been modeled. However, with the strong cellular bindings existent in tissue, torque
could only lead to macroscopically spinning tissues, which is not observed in the epidermis, since it is attached to the
rigid basal membrane. The insertion of torque into the model is thus possible, but has been only included eﬀectively
here by energy dissipation via drag forces. A usual choice for cell-medium friction is the well-known Stokes-relation

Note that in a strict sense, Newton’s third axiom only applies to the total two-body force. However, here the model

The friction constant γ⊥ predominantly describes internal friction within the cytoskeleton [41], since force contributions
for movements normal to the cell-cell contact surface are already contained within the JKR interaction model. The
friction constant γ⊥ is set to vanish within this article thereby implicitly assuming that dampening due to friction
within the cytoskeleton is much smaller than dampening due to cell-cell bindings. In contrast, the tangential friction
constant γk describes drag forces resulting from broken bindings during movements tangential to the intercellular
contact plane [12, 41]. For model consistency, the used contact surfaces are chosen identical with the JKR contact
surface ( 6). Since over a wide range of physiological overlaps this relates to the spherical overlap that would result
from undeformed spheres by about a factor of two, a diﬀerent choice of the contact surface could be compensated by
appropriately changed friction parameters.

deﬁniteness of the dampening matrix. Note that the number of next neighbors in contact corresponds to the number
of oﬀ-diagonal blocks in the dampening matrix, such that the system becomes extremely sparse for large matrices.

Such systems can for eﬃciency be supplemented with the weighted Delaunay triangulation of a set of spheres for
adjacency detection [42]. Since the dampening matrix is positive deﬁnite, the method of conjugate gradients [44]
is well suited to the problem. However, since realistic systems will contain much more than 5 cells, the matrices
would not ﬁt into main memory, if stored completely. Fortunately, the matrices are only sparsely populated and the

has been solved in three dimensions using the Crank-Nicolson scheme [46] with a discrete element method on a cubic
lattice using the algorithm of biconjugate gradients [45]. Note that due to the strongly varying diﬀusion coeﬃcients in
corniﬁed and non-corniﬁed tissue (see table I), the steady-state approximation is not applicable. The lattice constants
have been chosen larger than the cellular diameters to ensure for validity of the discretization approximation [13].
Note that the reaction diﬀusion equation for the nutrients is made positive deﬁnite by cells entering necrosis below
critical nutrient concentrations – necrotic cells do not consume nutrients, compare the next subsection. While the
timestep of the simulation is determined by a maximum spatial cellular stepsize (ﬁxed at 0.5 µm), the timestep of
the reaction-diﬀusion grids has been divided into several substeps such that the Courant factor [45] is smaller than 1
in order to increase numerical accuracy. To connect the discrete reaction-diﬀusion grid with the spatially-continuous
cellular positions, tri-linear interpolation has been used. In addition, the concentration has been ﬁxed to vanish at
grid nodes whose elementary cell did not contain cells. At grid nodes in the vicinity of cells the diﬀusive properties
have been smoothly adapted in the range of the values given in table I.

E. The cell cycle

Without representations of internal cellular states, the model would merely calculate the mechanical interaction
between a number of adhesively and elastically interacting deformable spheres. Extending a previous agent-based
modeling approach to the necessities of the epidermis, we distinguish between the following internal states in the
model: M-phase, G1-phase, S/G2-phase, G0-phase, necrotic, corniﬁed. The ﬁrst four states are illustrated in ﬁgure 4
left panel. During G1-phase, the cell volume grows at a constant rate rV, i. e., the radius increases according to

FIG. 4: Left: Model realization of the cell cycle. During cell division, cells reside in the M-phase for τ (m). Afterwards, the
cell volume increases at a constant rate in the G1-phase, until the pre-mitotic radius R(m) has been reached. At the end of the
G1-phase, the cell can either directly continue with the cell cycle or it can prolong the cycle time by entering the G0-phase, if
the local concentration of the regulative substance (water) exceeds a threshold U crit. The G0-phase is left after an individual
time drawn from a Gaussian distribution or if the local concentration of the regulating signal falls below the critical threshold.
Depending on the local nutrient concentration, cells can enter necrosis at any time in the cell cycle (not shown). In addition,
keratinocytes enter anoikis in the fourth cell generation after completion of the S/G2-phase. Top right: Displayed is the

minimum observed cycle time τ min and the durations of the S/G2-phase and the M-phase. Afterwards, no further
cell growth is performed. At the end of the G1-phase, a checkpointing mechanism is performed.

At this checkpoint, the cell can either enter the G0-phase or the S/G2-phase: A diﬀusible substance that moderates

eﬀective barrier against the loss of water, its solutes, and other substances as well [18, 48, 49]. As the simplest model
assumption, we will here assume the distribution of extracellular water to inﬂuence cell proliferation: If the local water
concentration is below a critical value (model parameter), the cell will directly continue the cell cycle, whereas in the
other case the cell cycle will be prolonged by the cell switching into the G0-phase. Note that the assumption of a
diﬀerent moderating diﬀusible signal would not signiﬁcantly change the model as long as it is not created or consumed
by the cells in the epidermis themselves. Cells leave the G0-phase to enter the S/G2-phase if either the local water
concentration falls below the threshold or after a maximum time has passed. This maximum time is drawn from
a Gaussian-distributed random number generator. Note that within this article the S-phase and G2-phase are not
distinguished, their inclusion would be a mere technical aspect. At the beginning of the phase the individual phase
duration is determined using a normally-distributed random number generator [39] with a given mean and width.
After this individual time has passed, the cells deterministically enter mitosis. Keratinocytes underly an exception at
this point: After the fourth cell generation, this cell line corniﬁes (enters anoikis) [7, 18, 47]. Note that within this
model, the diﬀerence between the S/G2-phase and the G0-phase is that the duration of the ﬁrst is determined by the
normally distributed individual time that can be derived from experiments, whereas the duration of the latter is also
controlled by the temporal evolution of the local water concentration.

One should be aware that our classiﬁcation of internal cellular states may not directly correspond to the realistic
biological system. However, the only net eﬀect of the existence of the G0-phase is the prolongation of the cell
cycle time: Cells in G0-phase can serve as a reservoir of cells ready to start proliferating as soon as the local water
concentration falls below a critical threshold. A diﬀerent terminology or a placement of the G0-phase after or within
the S/G2-phase would therefore not signiﬁcantly change the model.

At the beginning of the mitotic phase – which lasts for about half an hour for most cell types – a mother cell divides
and is replaced by two daughter cells. The radii of the daughter cells are decreased R(d) = R(m)2−1/3 to ensure
conservation of the target volume during M-phase. In addition, they are placed at distance d0
2−1/3) to
ensure that in this ﬁrst step the daughter cells do not leave the region occupied by the mother cell, see ﬁgure 4 right
panels. The initial direction of mitosis is chosen randomly. However, when considering the cell types, keratinocyte
stemcells divide asymmetrically, since by model assumption the upper daughter cell diﬀerentiates to a keratinocyte.
After insertion of the new cell and resetting of the mother cell parameters, the new cells are left to their initially
dominating repulsive forces ( 4). Note that an adaptive timestep derived from a maximum spatial stepsize ensures that
the mitotic partners do not loose contact. As in the S/G2-phase the individual duration of the M-phase is determined
using a normally-distributed random number generator. Afterwards, the daughter cells enter the G1-phase thus closing
the cell cycle.

Viable cells can enter necrosis at any time as soon as the nutrient concentration at the cellular position falls below
a cell-type speciﬁc critical threshold. As the dominant pathway to cell death, keratinocytes in contrast enter anoikis
after completing S/G2-phase in the fourth generation. Naturally, necrotic or corniﬁed cells do not consume any
nutrients. In view of the unknown details of the cell loss process, we have assumed an exponential decay of receptor
and ligand molecules on the cell membrane with a given rate α, i. e.,

In order to minimize the perturbation of the equilibrium distance following from equation ( 4), we have chosen to
decrease the elastic modulus as well. To maintain for similar cells a constant equilibrium distance, this implies a

Assuming that cells with low binding are shed of from the skin surface, we remove necrotic and corniﬁed cells from
Σmin (model parameter). Note that
the simulation as soon as their binding strength falls below a critical value Σi ≤
this choice also has the consequence that non-viable cells without contact to other cells are also removed from the
simulation. These cells do not have anchorage and would be shed oﬀ in the realistic epidermis. Though the loss of
receptors and ligands as well as decreasing cell elasticity may be reasonable assumptions for corniﬁed and necrotic

12

cells, the overall time coarse may be quite diﬀerent in reality. We have tried other forms of necrotic cell removal.
For example, one could think of removing non-viable cells randomly at a constant rate as was done in [13]. This
possibility however did signiﬁcantly disturb the layered structure of the stratum corneum. Holes in this protective
layer in turn did lead to sudden loss of water in the epidermis and thereby to irregular proliferative behavior and
considerable oscillations in epidermal thickness. The same problem occurred when assuming a (Gaussian-distributed)
cell-speciﬁc eigentime after which non-viable cells were removed from the simulation.

The stochastic elements involved in the cell cycle dynamics are the initial direction of mitosis and the durations of the
M-phase, the S/G2-phase, and the G0-phase. It is an empirical fact that times observed in biological systems underly
signiﬁcant stochastic deviations: For example, cell populations starting from a single cell desynchronize proliferation
after about ﬁve generations [50]. This behavior can not be explained by processes such as contact inhibition or nutrient
depletion, as these are not active for small systems with only 25 cells. Therefore, these stochastic elements have been
included in the M-phase and the S/G2-phase. If no stochastic deviation for the G0-phase is used, the model exhibits
artiﬁcial oscillations around a steady state even in later stages.

IV. SIMULATION SETUP

×

×

200 µm

As the computational domain, a rectangular box of dimensions 200 µm

400 µm has been considered. As
outlined in section II, epidermal tissue is obviously anisotropic. Thus, the boundary conditions are non-homogeneous
as well. Since the cellular kinetics is described with a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations ( 22), the term
“boundary condition” refers to the special interactions at the boundary of the computational domain. It is known
that a realistic epidermis exhibits a ruﬄed basal layer [15]. In order to treat the microenvironment of epidermal tissue
as simple as possible, the basal layer has been implemented here as a static planar boundary at the bottom with
normal vector ez. With using the JKR model ( 4), such a planar boundary can be well implemented by assuming
contact with a cell of inﬁnitely large radius. In addition, the z-boundary has been assumed to be of inﬁnite elasticity
Ebound =
. Since the elastic parameters enter additively in equation ( 2), this choice does not sensitively change
the global model behavior but merely shifts the equilibrium distance between basal membrane and bottom cell layer.
The corresponding adhesive anchorage in the basal layer has been made dependent on the cell type.
In order to
minimize the boundary eﬀects in x and y direction, periodic boundary conditions could be used. This however would
necessitate a rather tedious mirroring of cells close to the boundary. Therefore, here a diﬀerent (mirror cell) approach
has been chosen: Every cell in contact with a x or y boundary is assumed to be in contact with a cell of similar type,
size, receptor and ligand equipment, etc. In short, it interacts with a virtual mirror copy of itself, where the contact
area is situated within the boundary plane. In upper z-direction there are no boundary conditions on the cells – recall
that necrotic or corniﬁed cells are removed eventually. Note that in comparison to a static boundary this procedure
also has the advantage that drag force artifacts are reduced.

∞

To model the supply with water and nutrients from sub-basal layers, for the diﬀusion of water and nutrients, the
concentration at the lower z-boundary has been ﬁxed to the maximum value (Dirichlet boundary conditions), and
above the cell layers (dynamic thickness, a stratum corneum need not always exist during the simulations) both
concentrations are ﬁxed to 0. Technically, this has been implemented by setting the concentrations to vanish at all
grid volume elements not containing any cells. The resolution of the reaction-diﬀusion grid was low enough to prevent
the emergence of artiﬁcial sink terms in intercellular cavities throughout all simulations. At the x and y boundaries,
no-ﬂux von Neumann boundary conditions have been used, i. e., ∂xu = 0 and ∂yu = 0. Thus, for an in x and y
directions homogeneous cell distribution, the problem would eﬀectively reduce to a one-dimensional one.

The initial conditions have been determined as follows: A monolayer of keratinocyte stemcells is distributed on the
basal membrane. In addition, at a deﬁned position one (initially non-proliferating) melanocyte is added. Afterwards,
the position of the cells in the cell cycle is randomized uniformly to avoid initial artifacts. This conﬁguration could for
example mimic a severely perturbed epidermis, where suddenly not only the stratum corneum but also the stratum
medium was removed. Consequently, a strong proliferative response should be expected.

After establishment of a steady-state ﬂow equilibrium, diﬀerent perturbations have been performed. These include
removal of all corniﬁed cells (tape-stripping experiments) and changes in the melanocyte properties and will be
discussed in the next section.

V. RESULTS

A. Flow equilibrium

Our ﬁrst question was whether the proposed control mechanism of the water-concentration-induced prolongation
of the cell cycle time could actually produce the macroscopically observed ﬂow equilibrium of skin. In particular, we
asked whether

a steady-state ﬂow equilibrium is established, and

•

•

whether this equilibrium is stable against perturbations such as complete removal of the stratum corneum that
is performed for example in tape-stripping experiments [18].

It turns out that both questions have an aﬃrmative answer (see ﬁgure 5). Starting from a monolayer of cells, the

distribution predicting an approximate thickness of 120 µm above the basal membrane.

local water concentration above the basal membrane is quite low such that no cell enters cell cycle prolongation.
The net eﬀect is an initial exponential growth phase (top left panel). After four generations, corniﬁcation of the
ﬁrst keratinocytes begins, followed by the formation of a stratum corneum with a considerably decreased diﬀusion
coeﬃcient for water. This in turn leads to an increased water concentration and thereby a greater fraction of cells
residing in G0-phase: The initial exponential growth slows down to polynomial and then decreases, since the corniﬁed
cells shed of the skins surface. Afterwards, the dynamics equilibrates. After 35 days, a tape-stripping experiment

14

has been performed: All corniﬁed cells are suddenly removed from the simulation. This leads again to a proliferative
response. However, since this time the corniﬁed layer quickly re-establishes due to reservoir cells in G0-phase, the
proliferative response is considerably smaller than initially. Note that the dominant contribution to the rapid formation
of the corniﬁed layer in the model results from the fraction of G0-keratinocytes that have already reached their fourth
generation. Interestingly, the oscillations around the equilibrium value are remarkably strong. The number of cells
displays a slight (but decelerating) upward tendency, but 15 days after the disturbance (last vertical line), saturation
is nearly reached. The ﬁnal cell numbers correspond well to observed densities of keratinocytes (75000 cells per square
mm skin [17]). In the top right panel of ﬁgure 5 it is demonstrated that with an intact stratum corneum (second and
last frame), the water concentration is large in the lower layers of the epidermis and than falls rapidly. In ﬁgure 5
bottom row it becomes visible in the latest frame that the corniﬁed layer exhibits a small hole (cells in dark grey).
Due to a considerable loss of water, this causes many distant keratinocytes to leave their cell cycle arrest (cells in
light grey changing to cells in dark grey) and thereby leads to a perturbation of the equilibrium.

In [47] the authors hypothesize about a diﬀusible substance that moderates cellular proliferation times. The present
model does not contradict the hypothesis that this substance could simply be the moisture of the epidermis but other
diﬀusible substances would presumably lead to equivalent model behavior.

B. Melanocyte anchorage

Our second question was how the degree of anchorage to the basal layer would inﬂuence the ability of cancerous
melanocytes to persist within the skin. It is well-known that most human melanoma cell lines have decreased or no
expression of cadherins and exhibit a decreased ability to adhere to keratinocytes [51]. At ﬁrst, we suspected that
increased basal adhesion would lead to an increased fraction of melanocytes bound to the basal membrane and thereby
a smaller fraction that is shed to regions where the nutrient supply falls below necrosis-inducing levels. Thus, the total
number of melanocytes should decrease with decreasing anchorage. In order to test this, a single non-proliferating
melanocyte was placed at the basal layer in the center of the computational domain, and the system was evolved until
ﬂow equilibrium was established. Then, the melanocyte was turned cancerous by suddenly allowing for proliferation
with a much larger rate than keratinocytes. In addition, we concomitantly reduced the anchorage to the basal layer.
Starting from experience with multicellular tumor spheroids [13], we assumed the cycle time of cancerous melanocytes
to be in the order of 15 hours. Surprisingly, it turned out that with this cycle time for melanocytes and the turnover
time estimated for the stemcells in the basal layer, the overall growth dynamics was hardly dependent on the anchorage
to the basal layer, see ﬁgure 6 left panel. Initially, the growth of melanocytes follows an exponential growth, which is
soon slowed down since the melanocytes reach distant regions from the basal layer, where nutrient support is poor.
Since due to nutrient depletion the total number of viable cells already indicates saturation, also the total number
of melanocytes must saturate eventually. Even with no adhesion to the basal membrane, comparable numbers of
tumor cells were achieved. Direct observation of the cross-sections (not shown) revealed the reason: With the given
melanocyte proliferation rate of 15 hours, exponential growth was always faster than the epidermal ﬂow induced by
the turnover on the basal layer.

Consequently, we varied the proliferation rate of the cancerous cells in combination with complete loss of basal
membrane anchorage (see ﬁgure 6 right panel). It turned out that there is a region of proliferation rates, where the
melanocytes do not persist within the epidermis. This region is separated from the region of melanoma persistence
by a comparably large domain where stochastic eﬀects become important. Interestingly, in this case the period of
coexistence of healthy skin and transformed cells may be remarkably long, which may give time for further malignant
transformations in the realistic epidermis.

±

We further examined the region that separates melanoma persistence and complete shed-oﬀ of cancerous
5.56) h. One ﬁnds that the usual spher-
melanocytes by changing the melanocyte cycle time to τmel = (44.44
ical form one observes for in vitro tumor spheroids is considerably deformed for this system to cylinder-shaped or
cone-shaped, compare ﬁgure 7 left panel. This is due to the pre-existent ﬂow-equilibrium of the surrounding tissue and
the eﬀective one-dimensional diﬀusional constraint. Note also that the boundaries of the tumors are rather diﬀuse.
Initially, a thin column of cancerous melanocytes is formed. Then, in the example in ﬁgure 7, left panel, ﬁrst row, the
melanocytes can persist within the life-sustaining zone until their growth velocity outweighs the upward-directed ﬂow
velocity and direct contact with the basal membrane is re-established. Afterwards, in the middle of the column of
cancerous cells the upward forces are decreased, since for the interior cells there is no direct contact with keratinocytes
moving upwards. In the simulations in ﬁgure 7 left panel, the thickness of the epidermis increases in those simulations
where the tumor has re-established contact with the basal membrane. This is due to the displacement of keratinocytes
– which are constrained in x and y dimensions – and also to the loss of the protective corniﬁed layer, which leads to
enlarged keratinocyte proliferation rates. It may be speculated that the cross-sections correspond to initial stages of
a highly aggressive nodular melanoma [19] that has not yet become clinically manifest. It may be hypothesized that

FIG. 6: Left: Total number of melanocytes (grey, including necrotic and viable melanocytes) and viable cells (black, including
stemcells, keratinocytes, and melanocytes) for diﬀerent degrees of basal adhesion versus time – expressed in units of the
cancerous melanocyte cycle time. For the assumed melanocyte cycle time of τmel = (15.0 ± 2.0) h and other parameters
chosen as in table I, the basal anchorage has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the overall dynamics. Right: With considerably slower
melanocyte proliferation and completely absent adhesion to the basal layer, a parameter regime can be found where melanoma
do not persist within the steady-state ﬂow equilibrium. There, the system is sensitive to stochastic eﬀects, as is also indicated
in the disturbed order (some curves intersect). The slowly-damped oscillations stem from the small standard deviations of cell
cycle durations (2 h in every run).

the micrometastases sometimes observed around primary melanoma in skin may correspond to branches of melanoma
clones that have separated from the main clone during the upward ﬂow. Interestingly, the shapes of these structures
appear to be dynamically changing in these initial phases.

Using diﬀerent initial seed values for the random number generator, we have performed several simulations with
otherwise equal parameters. It turns out that completely diﬀerent outcomes may occur in this region of melanocyte
proliferation rates (ﬁgure 7 left panel and thick curves in the right panel). The stochastic eﬀects result from stochastic
forces, the randomly chosen mitotic direction, and the randomly distributed duration times of the cell cycle.
In
this in silico experiment, the diﬀerent seed value did already lead to diﬀerent conﬁgurations before the malignant
transformation. More speciﬁc, the initial conditions for the growth of cancerous melanocytes had also been varied
by employing stochastic elements before. In order to separate these eﬀects, we started another series of simulations
with equal initial seed values. However, here in contrast the seed value of the random number generators was reset
right at the time of the malignant transformation. Thus, the initial environment of the cancerous melanocyte was
very similar in these simulations. It turned out that the variance of the outcomes narrowed considerably (thin grey
curves in ﬁgure 7 right panel) but still exhibit large variations in the cell number (logarithmic plot). Thus, it can be
concluded that the initial environment of cancerous melanocytes contributes signiﬁcantly to the ﬁnal outcome. Note
that this does not only refer to the spatial cellular position, but also to the local proliferative state and thereby to
the local upward ﬂow velocity: The upward drag forces will be larger if the cancerous cell is surrounded by many
proliferating keratinocytes with a net upward ﬂow velocity.

In conclusion, stochastic eﬀects generally play an important role in the initial phases of in silico melanoma devel-
opment, since for the small cell numbers in the initial phases, they do not average out completely. In addition, their
secondary consequences, i. e., the variation of the initial local environment by stochastic inﬂuences, are relevant.

VI. MODEL PARAMETERS

Reasonable dynamics has been achieved with the parameters in table I.
The viscosity of the extracellular matrix η determines the friction on loosely bound cells and – since friction due
0) – also dominates friction in directions normal to the cell contact
to the cytoskeleton is assumed to be small (γ⊥ ≈
surfaces. Thereby, also the initial speed of cell division in M-phase is dominantly dependent on η. Large viscosities
lead to increased friction. As long as the force relaxation occurs on a shorter timescale than the total cell doubling
time, this does not have macroscopic eﬀects on the evolution of the tissue. This is diﬀerent when γ⊥ does not vanish. If
it has the same order of magnitude as γk, it will dominate the contribution inﬂicted by the viscosity η. However, if the
magnitude of the total drag force coeﬃcient does not change (marked by γ2 = γ2
k, we have found by comparing

⊥ + γ2

16

FIG. 7: Left: In silico evolution of cancerous melanocytes (black) within an epidermal population containing keratinocytes
(light grey) and stemcells (the bottom layer). Note that the cross-sections do not distinguish between viable and necrotic or
viable and corniﬁed cells, respectively. The times at which the cross-sections have been produced are marked in the right panel
with dashed lines. The ﬁrst row corresponds to the seed value 1 (thick black curves in the right panel), the second row to
seed value 4 (thick curves in grey), and the last row to seed value 5 (thick curves in light grey). Note that the diameter of
a single frame is 200 µm only, such that the ﬁgure represents the state before clinical manifestation. Right: Total number
of melanocytes (thick lines) and necrotic melanocyte subpopulation (associated dashed curves emerging around day 10) after
the malignant transformation. For the thick lines, the diﬀerent shades of grey correspond to diﬀerent initial seed values (with
otherwise equal parameters) of the random number generator. Consequently, these simulations also already include a changed
environment for the melanocyte at the time of its malignant transformation. Note that for seed value 4 there are hardly any
viable melanocytes left after 45 days (dashed and solid curves combine). This is diﬀerent if the stochastic eﬀects do not refer
to the initial environment conﬁguration of the cancerous melanocyte (thin curves in light grey).

the three extreme cases (that is, γ⊥ = 0, γk = γ and γ⊥ = γ, γk = 0 and γ⊥ = γk = γ/√2) that the diﬀerences in the
overall population dynamics are rather small. It may be speculated that this is because in the present calculations
the relaxation speed has no direct back-reaction on the number of cells, as in contrast to [13, 41] contact inhibition
does not play a role. As here absence of perpendicular friction has been assumed, the tangential friction coeﬃcient γk
dominantly determines the speed of relaxation within the tissue. The chosen value led to reasonable dynamics and
has been estimated from [41].

The adhesion energy density σmax determines the cell-cell equilibrium distance and the binding strength, which
was a marker for the removal of necrotic or corniﬁed cells. Generally, this value will in reality be time-dependent,
compare also the discussion at the end of subsection III A. Therefore, the binding energy density has been derived from
the observed equilibrium distance [34] solving ( 4) instead. With this procedure, the equilibrium distances are in a
physiological regime. Note that larger adhesion will lead to smaller equilibrium distances (with moderately increased
contact surfaces and drag forces) but also to longer persistence times of dead cells, which results in an increased
thickness of the stratum corneum. However, due to equation ( 25) this latter eﬀect only enters logarithmically. When
both the adhesion energy σmax and the minimum anchorage Σmin are decreased, one will still have to decrease the
maximum stepsize in the numerical solution to maintain the level of accuracy. This is due to the fact that for decreased
adhesion, the equilibrium distance and the contact distance dcontact

= Ri + Rj are closer together.

The elastic parameters correspond to approximate physiologic values for cells [41, 53, 54]. However, it is known that –
depending on the cell type – signiﬁcant deviations may occur. With the given drag forces, mechanical relaxation occurs
on a shorter scale than the cell cycle times, such that changes in physiologic windows have only small macroscopic
consequences. It should be noted however that already for moderately changed Young moduli (and/or reduced Poisson
moduli) the equilibrium distance between cells will be shifted, which might make decreased maximum spatial stepsizes
necessary in the numerical solution to avoid unphysiological losses of contact.

ij

As has already been discussed above, the stochastic elements may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on melanoma develop-
ment. These can be divided into stochastic forces, randomly chosen durations of the cell cycle phases, and the random
direction of mitosis.

Stochastic forces contribute to the detachment of corniﬁed and necrotic cells, since these do neither advance in the
cell cycle nor proliferate. We have found that small variations in the strength of stochastic forces in physiologic regimes
only change the ﬂuctuations in the epidermal thickness around the unchanged equilibrium value. On a technical level,
the existence of a planar basal layer in combination with completely absent stochastic forces sometimes led to planar
cell conﬁgurations at the basal layer, which is unfavorable for the Delaunay triangulation [42]. As may be expected,

TABLE I: Model parameters have been estimated from independent experiments or they have been varied as ﬁt parameters.
Parameters not included in the table have been varied and are discussed in separate sections of this article.

considerably larger stochastic forces have a strong inﬂuence on the thickness of the stratum corneum, since loosely
bound cells are removed much faster and the protective layer is lost easily. This in turn leads to loss of water and
on-going reactions of keratinocytes that leave G0-phase.

The values of the durations of M-phase τ (m), the S/G2-phase τ S/G2 and the prolongation of the cell cycle τ (G0)
inﬂuence the relative distribution of cells within the cell cycle, whereas the sum of their squared widths primarily
determines the speed of desynchronization of cell division (compare ﬁgures 6 and 7 right panels). Due to missing data,
the durations of these cellular states have been ﬁxed from a previous publication [13]. The shortest observed cycle time
determines the proliferation time for keratinocytes when the water concentration is below the critical threshold and
has been estimated from experimental observations [47]. The system is most sensitive to the G0-phase prolongation
time τ G0 , which has been estimated from [18] to yield reasonable dynamics.

Without the modeling constraint that on division of keratinocyte stemcells, only the upper cell becomes a diﬀer-
entiating keratinocyte, the basal layer would loose more and more stemcells in the model. In other cell divisions, the
simple assumption of a randomly distributed initial mitotic direction did not lead to numerical artifacts. However, it
can be expected that the conﬁguration of the neighbor cells soon changes the initial direction of the mitotic doublet.
The equilibrium thickness of the corniﬁed layer is strongly dependent on the receptor loss rate α and the minimum
anchorage Σmin. In addition, it will be sensitive to the cycle times of stemcells and keratinocytes, since these determine
the number of keratinocytes ﬁnally undergoing corniﬁcation.

The average cell volume of keratinocytes varies from 425 µm3 for corniﬁed cells to 800 µm3 for stratum granulosum
keratinocytes [52]. Therefore, with the intrinsic assumption of spherical shape, the maximum cell radius has been
ﬁxed to R(m) = 5.0 µm, which also inﬂuences the time-dependent target volume. Note however, that within the
stratum corneum the corniﬁed cells ﬂatten considerably and the realistic intrinsic cell shape cannot be regarded as
spherical anymore.

The glucose uptake rate for cancerous melanocytes λ(mel) has been chosen considerably larger than the glucose
uptake rate of keratinocytes λ(ker). This is motivated by the assumption that cancerous cells have a considerably
increased metabolism. The actual values are in the range observed for other tumor cells [55]. The minimum nutrient
concentration U crit
gluc, below which for melanocytes necrosis is induced, has been chosen to be in the order of 1 mM, since
necrosis of cancer cells becomes visible at these nutrient concentrations in vitro [56, 62]. Thereby, the combination of
melanocyte nutrient uptake rate and minimum glucose concentration deﬁne a region, where melanocytes can survive.
For simplicity we have assumed that as a net eﬀect the cells do not consume or secrete water. The critical relative

determined experimentally by various studies. Though strong variances exist, all of them predict a strong decline of
the apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient [48, 49, 59]. Roughly speaking, the local water diﬀusion coeﬃcients inﬂuence the
gradient of water concentration: Large diﬀusion coeﬃcients correspond to a small gradient. Therefore, for an intact
stratum corneum the water concentration is approximately constant throughout the stratum medium and then falls

The same general features hold true for the glucose diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dtissue
gluc , which has speciﬁcally been deter-
mined for the human skin [60]. The glucose concentration at the basal layer U bound
has been ﬁxed to values that
are normal for blood [61] for non-diabetic persons. However, it should be noted that in reality the blood glucose
concentration may vary signiﬁcantly – for example after a meal. Since within the model for normal parameter sets
anoikis is the predominant pathway for keratinocytes and dominantly the cancerous melanocytes consume glucose at
large rates in the model, the glucose concentration strongly inﬂuences the chances of melanocyte survival here.

In order not to loose stemcells at the basal layer migrating upwards to the stratum corneum, the basal adhesion
energy has been chosen to be twice the maximum adhesion energy density σmax. This did suﬃce to disable loss of
stemcells. For non-proliferating melanocytes, the basal adhesion has been chosen similarly.

VII. DISCUSSION

It had been demonstrated in [13] that with the aid of kinetic and dynamic weighted Delaunay triangulations agent-
based models can treat up to 105 . . . 106 cells.
In the present contribution, it has been shown that with a more
complete treatment of the equations of motion, such models can still handle 104 . . . 105 cells. From a biological point
of view, a diﬀusible substance can serve as a moderator on cellular proliferation in the epithelium. The parameters
used suggest that a simple candidate of this substance could be extracellular water. The homeostasis was found to
be stable against perturbations such as tape-stripping experiments. Independently, the consequences of a varying
basal adhesion of cancerous melanocytes have been studied. It turned out that these are strongly interlinked with the
balance of proliferative melanocyte and keratinocyte activities. In addition, it has been shown that in some regions of
parameter space, stochastic eﬀects and especially their consequences on the initial state on the environment play an
important role in the in silico representation of melanoma growth. It is the truth content of some critical assumptions
and the quality of the applied approximations that determine the applicability of these results to reality. The model
presented has some shortcomings, which we summarize below:

From our point of view, the most signiﬁcant macroscopic shortcoming of our approach is the failure of the model to
explain the reduced thickness of the stratum corneum. This is due to the fact that the inherent cell shape is spherical,
whereas corniﬁed cells ﬂatten and form polarized adhesive bindings [15]. In reality, this will lead to a greater stability
of the stratum corneum in comparison to the model, which would also imply a smoother evolution around the steady-
state ﬂow equilibrium than exhibited in ﬁgure 5 left panel. Possibly, choosing ellipsoids in contrast to spheres as the
intrinsic cell shape [12] may provide an alternative. Another possibility would be to use boundary-based models such
as e. g. the extended Potts model [63], which however should be carefully adapted to cellular processes and has the
disadvantage of using enormous computational resources due to the many degrees of freedom.

From the theoretical point of view, the model could be signiﬁcantly improved by deriving a contact model valid
for two-body interactions that also include non-normal forces and do not underlie the constraints of only small cell
deformations. Also, for in vitro cell populations that are not ﬁxed to a substrate, the eﬀects of torque may become
important. These reﬁned theories however require much better experimental resolution than currently provided. It
appears questionable whether center-based models are able to cope with the increasing degree of complexity resulting
from these improvements.

The basal layer has been approximated with a plane boundary condition in this article. In reality however, this
basal layer is known to have a corrugated structure. This would signiﬁcantly enlarge the region where water and
nutrients are provided in abundance and thereby lead to a far greater cell reservoir that is able to start a proliferative
response in case of injury. It may be speculated that this is one of the reasons why the ruﬄed basal layer has developed
in skin.

The dynamics of the nutrients and of water has been described with a reaction-diﬀusion approach here. However, due
to the cellular movement, there will also be a convective and a transport contribution that is completely neglected in
the current simulations. With the large diﬀusion coeﬃcient for water and nutrients in viable tissues, this approximation
is presumably valid within the viable layers but may be questionable in the stratum corneum. Note that the polarized
structure of the corniﬁed cells in the stratum corneum may also give rise to non-isotropic diﬀusion, where the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient is not a scalar value anymore. To a ﬁrst approximation however, this eﬀect may be well absorbed into the
apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient as is done in the experimental measurements.

19

The cell cycle has been approximated here by a small number of internal cellular states only.

It may also be
questioned whether a subdivision into discrete substates makes sense. One may also expect a much smoother reaction
of the epidermis to the removal of all keratinocytes if transition into and out of G0-phase would not depend on a
threshold water concentration, but would be determined by transition probabilities that may continuously depend on
the water concentration. This may be judged with quantiﬁed experimental data.

The model also uses comparably many parameters but all of them have a distinct physical counterpart. This makes
it possible to determine many parameters by independent experiments. Despite of all the previously-mentioned short-
comings (most of these being valid for lattice-based approaches as well), oﬀ-lattice agent-based models also have
important advantages over most lattice models: They are less vulnerable to artifacts resulting from anisotropies and
have the intrinsic potential to use physical (realistic) parameters with a moderate increase in computational eﬀort.
This opens the possibility to gain knowledge about the system by falsifying the model using independent experi-
ments. Therefore, quantiﬁed experiments on well-deﬁned experimental systems are of urgent interest to constrain the
uncontrolled growth in the number of theoretical models on cellular tissue.

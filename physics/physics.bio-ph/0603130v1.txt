Diﬀusion Coeﬃcients

We describe a method for analyzing the stochasticity in the non-stationary data for the beat-to-beat
ﬂuctuations in the heart rates of healthy subjects, as well as those with congestive heart failure. The
method analyzes the returns time series of the data as a Markov process, and computes the Markov
time scale, i.e., the time scale over which the data are a Markov process. We also construct an
eﬀective stochastic continuum equation for the return series. We show that the drift and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients, as well as the amplitude of the returns time series for healthy subjects are distinct from
those with CHF. Thus, the method may potentially provide a diagnostic tool for distinguishing
healthy subjects from those with congestive heart failure, as it can distinguish small diﬀerences
between the data for the two classes of subjects in terms of well-deﬁned and physically-motivated
quantities.

Introduction

Cardiac interbeat intervals ﬂuctuate in a complex man-
ner [1–7]. Recent studies reveal that under normal con-
ditions, beat-to-beat ﬂuctuations in the heart rate may
display extended correlations of the type typically exhib-
ited by dynamical systems far from equilibrium. It has
been shown [2], for example, that the various stages of
sleep may be characterized by long-range correlations in
the heart rates, separated by a large number of beats.

The analysis of the interbeat ﬂuctuations in the heart
rates belong to a much broader class of many natural, as
well as man-made, phenomena that are characterized by
a degree of stochasticity. Turbulent ﬂows, ﬂuctuations
in the stock market prices, seismic recordings, the in-
ternet traﬃc, pressure ﬂuctuations in chemical reactors,
and the surface roughness of many materials and rock [8],
are but a few examples of such phenomena and systems.
A long standing problem has been the development of
an eﬀective reconstruction method for such phenomena.
That is, given a set of data for certain characteristics
of such phenomena (for example, the interbeat ﬂuctua-
tions in the heart rates), one would like to develop an
eﬀective equation that can reproduce the data with an
accuracy comparable to the measured data. Although
many methods have been suggested in the past, and con-
siderable progress has been made, the problem remains,
to a large extent, unsolved.

In many cases the stochastic process to be analyzed
is non-stationary. If the process also exhibits extended
correlations, then deducing its statistical properties by
the standard methods of analyzing such processes is very
diﬃcult. One approach to analyze such processes was

proposed by Stanley and co-workers [1,3,5,20–24] and
others [25–29]. They studied data for heart-rate ﬂuctua-
tions, for both healthy subjects and those with congestive
heart failure (CHF), in terms of self-aﬃne fractal distri-
butions, such as the fractional Brownian motion (FBM).
The FBM is a non-stationary stochastic process which in-
duces long-range correlations, the successive increments
of which are, however, stationary and follow a Gaussian
distribution. The power spectrum of a FBM is given by,
S(f ) ∝ f −(2H+1), where H is the Hurst exponent that
characterizes the type of the correlations that the data
contain. Thus, one may distinguish healthy subjects from
those with CHF in terms of the numerical value of H as-
sociated with the data: negative or antipersistent corre-
lations for H < 1/2, as opposed to positive or persistent
correlations for H > 1/2. The analysis of Stanley and co-
workers indicated that there may indeed be long-range
correlations in heart-rate ﬂuctuations data that can be
characterized by the FBM and similar fractal distribu-
tions. In addition, the data for healthy subjects seem to
be characterized by H < 1/2, whereas those with CHF
by H > 1/2. This was a signiﬁcant discovery over the
traditional methods of analyzing non-stationary data for
heart-rate ﬂuctuations.

However, values of the Hurst exponent H associated
with the two groups of subjects are non-universal. Thus,
it would, for example, be diﬃcult to distinguish the two
groups of subjects if their associated Hurst exponents are
both close to 1/2. In addition, the FBM is a non-self-
averaging distribution, i.e., given a ﬁxed Hurst exponent
H, each realization of a FBM may be signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from its other realizations with the same H. As
a result, estimating H alone and characterizing the data

by a FBM cannot enable one to predict the future trends
of the data. One may also analyze such data by the de-
terended ﬂuctuating analysis [2–5] which, in many cases,
is capable of yielding accurate and insightful information
about the nature of the data.

Recently, a novel method of analyzing stochastic pro-
cesses was introduced [9–12]. It was shown that by an-
alyzing stochastic phenomena as Markov processes and
computing their Markov time (or length) scale (that is,
the time scale over which the process can be thought of as
Markov), one may reconstruct the original process with
similar statistical properties by constructing an eﬀective
equation that governs the process. The constructed equa-
tion helps one to understand the nature and properties
of the stochastic process. The method utilizes a set of
experimental data for a phenomenon which contains a
degree of stochasticity, and constructs a simple equa-
tion that governs the phenomenon [9–16]. The method
is quite general; it is capable of providing a rational ex-
planation for complex features of the phenomenon. More
signiﬁcantly, it requires no scaling feature.

In this paper we describe a method for analyzing non-
stationary data, and then utilize it to study the inter-
beat ﬂuctuations in the heart rates. We show that the
application of the method to the analysis of interbeat
ﬂuctuations in the heart rates may potentially lead to
a novel method for distinguishing healthy subjects from
those with CHF.

The plan of this paper is as follows. In the next section,
we describe the method. We then utilize the method to
analyze data for heart-rate ﬂuctuations in human sub-
jects.

FIG. 1. Interbeats ﬂuctuations of healthy subjects (top),

and its returns (bottom).

Markov Analysis of Non-Stationary Data

FIG. 2. Interbeats ﬂuctuations of subjects with congestive

heart failure (top), and its returns (bottom).

Given a (discrete) non-stationary time series ri, we in-
troduce a quantity xi, called the return of ri, deﬁned by

xi = ln(ri+1/ri) ,

(1)

where ri is the value of the stochastic quantity at step i.
If there are long-range positive correlations in the series,
then ri and ri+1 are close in values and, therefore, we
expect the series xi to have very small values for all t.
For white noise, as well as data that exhibit negative or
anti-correlations, ri and ri+1 can be completely diﬀerent
and, therefore, the time series xi will ﬂuctuate strongly.
Figures 1 and 2 present the typical data ri and the
corresponding returns xi for healthy subjects and those
with CHF. The number of data is of the order of 30,000-
40,000, taken over a period of about 6 hours. It is evident
that the returns series for the subjects with CHF has
small amplitudes, implying that the ri data set has long-
range positive correlations, which is consistent with the
previous analysis [1]. It can be veriﬁed straightforwardly
that the series xi is stationary, by measuring the stability

of its average and variance in a moving window (that
is, over a period of time which varies over the length
of the series).
Due to the stationarity of the series
x(t), we can construct an eﬀective stochastic equation
for the returns series of the two groups of subjects, and
distinguish the data for healthy subjects from those with
CHF. The procedure to do so involves two key steps:

(1) Computing the Markov time scale (MTS) tM con-
stitutes the ﬁrst step.
tM is the minimum time inter-
val over which the data can be considered as a Markov
process [9–12,17]. As is well-known, a given stochastic
process with a degree of randomness may have a ﬁnite or
even an inﬁnite tM . To estimate the MTS tM , we note
that a complete characterization of the statistical proper-
ties of stochastic ﬂuctuations of a quantity x(t) in terms
of a parameter t requires the evaluation of the joint prob-
ability distribution function (PDF) Pn(x1, t1; · · · ; xn, tn)
for an arbitrary n, the number of the data points. If a
stochastic phenomenon is a Markov process, an impor-
tant simpliﬁcation can be made as Pn, the n-point joint

PDF, is generated by the product of the conditional prob-
abilities, p(xi+1, ti+1|xi, ti), for i = 1, · · · , n − 1.

The simplest way to determine tM for stationary data
is by using the least-square test. The rigorous mathe-
matical deﬁnition of a Markov process is given [18] by

P (xk, tk|xk−1, tk−1; · · · ; x1, t1; x0, t0)

= P (xk, tk|xk−1, tk−1) .

(2)

Intuitively, the physical interpretation of a Markov pro-
cess is that it ”forgets its past.” In other words, only
the closest ”event” to xk, say xk−1 at time tk−1, is rel-
evant to the probability of the event xk at tk. Hence,
the ability for predicting the event xk is not enhanced by
knowing its values in steps prior to the the most recent
one. Therefore, an important simpliﬁcation that is made
for a Markov process is that, the conditional multivariate
joint PDF is written in terms of the products of simple
two parameter conditional PDF’s [18] as (3)

P (xk, tk; xk−1, tk−1; · · · ; x1, t1|x0, t0)

=

P (xi, ti|xi−1, ti−1) .

(3)

k

Yi=1

Testing Eq. (3) for large values of k is beyond the current
computational capability. For k = 3 (three points or
events), however, the working equation, given by,

P (x3, t3|x2, t2; x1, t1) = P (x3, t3|x2, t2) ,

(4)

should hold for any value of t2 in the interval t1 < t2 < t3.
A process is then Markovian if Eq. (4) is satisﬁed for a
certain time separation t3−t2, in which case, tM = t3−t2.
Thus, to compute the tM we use a fundamental theory of
probability according to which we write any three-point
PDF in terms of the conditional probability functions as,

P (x3, t3; x2, t2; x1, t1)

= P (x3, t3|x2, t2; x1, t1)P (x2, t2; x1, t1).

(5)

Using the properties of Markov processes to substitute
Eq. (5), we obtain,

PMarkov(x3, t3; x2, t2; x1, t1)

= P (x3, t3|x2, t2)P (x2, t2; x1, t1).

(6)

We then compare the deviation of PMarkov from that
given by Eq. (5). Using the least square method [10],
we write:

χ2 =

Z

dx3dx2dx1×

[P (x3, t3; x2, t2; x1, t1) − PMarkov(x3, t3; x2, t2; x1, t1)]2

, (7)

σ2 + σ2

Markov

where σ2 and σ2
Markov are the corresponding variances of
terms in the nominator. Thus, one should plot the re-
ν = χ2/N (with N being the number
duced chi-square, χ2
of degrees of freedom), as a function of the time scale
t3 − t2. Then, tM = t3 − t2 for that value of t3 − t2 for
which χ2
ν either achieves a minimum or becomes ﬂat and
does not change anymore; see Figure 3.

On the other hand, a necessary condition for a stochas-
tic phenomenon to be a Markov process is that the
Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) equation (8),

P (x3, t3|x1, t1) =

dx2 P (x3, t3|x2, t2) P (x2, t2|x1, t1) , (8)

Z

should hold for the time separation t3 − t2, in which case,
tM = t3 − t2. Therefore, to test whether the time series
x(t) is a Matkov process, one should check the valid-
ity of the CK equation for describing the process using
diﬀerent x1 by comparing the directly-evaluated condi-
tional probability distributions P (x3, t3|x1, t1) with the
one calculated according to right side of Eq. (8).

(2) Estimation of the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients is the
second step of constructing an eﬀective equation for de-
scribing the series xi. The CK equation is an evolution
equation for the distribution function P (x, t) at any time
t. When formulated in diﬀerential form, the CK equation
yields the Kramers-Moyal (KM) expansion [18], given by,

∂

P (x, t) =

(−

)n[D(n)(x)P (x, t)] .

(9)

The coeﬃcients D(n)(x, t) are called the KM coeﬃcients.
They are estimated directly from the data, the condi-
tional probability distributions, and the moments M (n)
deﬁned by,

M (n) =

(10)

According to the Pawula’s theorem, for a process with
D(4) ∼ 0 all the D(n) with n ≥ 3 vanish, in which case the
KM expansion reduces to the Fokker-Planck equation,
also known as the Kolomogrov equation [18]:

P (x, t) . (11)

Here D(1)(x, t) is the drift coeﬃcient, representing the
deterministic part of the process, and D(2)(x, t) is the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient that represents the stochastic part.

We now apply the above method to the ﬂuctuations
in the human heartbeats of both healthy subjects and

ν values for a typical subject with CHF for several

those with CHF. As mentioned in the Introduction, sev-
eral studies [5,6,10–12,19–21] indicate that, under nor-
mal conditions, the beat-to-beat ﬂuctuations in the heart
rate may display extended correlations of the type typ-
ically exhibited by dynamical systems far from equilib-
rium, and that the two groups of subjects may be distin-
guished from one another by a Hurst exponent. We show
that the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients (as deﬁned above)
of the interbeat ﬂuctuations of healthy subjects and pa-
tients with CHF have distinct behavior, when analyzed
by the method we propose in this paper, hence enabling
one to distinguish the two groups of the subjects.

We analyzed both daytime (12:00 pm to 18:00 pm) and
nighttime (12:00 am to 6:00 am) heartbeat time series
of healthy subjects, and the daytime records of patients
with CHF. Our data base includes 10 healthy subjects
(7 females and 3 males with ages between 20 and 50,
and an average age of 34.3 years), and 12 subjects with
CHF (3 females and 9 males with ages between 22 and
71, and an average age of 60.8 years). Figures 1 and 2
present the data. We ﬁrst estimate the Markov time scale
tM for the returns series of the interbeat ﬂuctuations,
using the chi-square method described above. In Figure
3 the results for the χ2
ν values for a subject with CHF
are shown. For the healthy subjects we ﬁnd the average
tM for the returns, for both the day- and nighttime data,
to be (all the values are measured in units of the average
time scale for the beat-to-beat times of each subject),
tM = 10. On the other hand, for the daytime records
of the patients with CHF, the estimated average tM is,
tM = 20. Therefore, the data for the healthy subjects are
characterized by tM values that are smaller than that of
the patients with CHF by a signiﬁcant factor of 2.

We then check the validity of the CK equation for sev-

eral x1 triplets by comparing the directly-evaluated con-
ditional probability distributions P (x3, t3|x1, t1) with the
ones calculated according to right side of Eq. (8). Here,
x represents the returns. In Figure 4, the two diﬀerently-
computed PDFs are compared. Assuming the statistical
errors to be the square root of the number of events in
each bin, we ﬁnd that the two PDFs are statistically iden-
tical.

Using Eq. (10) directly we calculate the drift and dif-
fusion coeﬃcients, D(1)(x) and D(2)(x), for the entire set
of data for the healthy subjects, as well as those with
CHF. The corresponding D(1)(x) and D(2)(x) are dis-
played in Figure 5. We ﬁnd that, these coeﬃcients pro-
vide another important indicator for distinguishing the
ill from the healthy subjects: The drift D(1) and the dif-
fusion coeﬃcients D(2)(x) follow, respectively, linear and
quadratic equations in x with distinct coeﬃcients for the
healthy subjects and patients with CHF. The analysis
of the data yields the following estimate for the healthy
subjects (averaged over the samples),

D(1)(x) = −0.1x ,

D(2)(x) = 3.7 × 10

−5 − 6.6 × 10

−5x + 0.06x2 ,

(12)

with −0.15 < x < 0.15, whereas for the patients with
CHF we ﬁnd that,

D(1)(x) = −0.06x ,

with −0.04 < x < 0.04.

D(2)(x) = 8.6 × 10

−6 − 2.7 × 10

−5x + 0.03x2 .

(13)

We ﬁnd two important diﬀerences between the heart-

beat dynamics of the two classes of subjects:

(1) Compared with the healthy subjects, the drift and
diﬀusion coeﬃcients for the patients with CHF are small.
(2) The ﬂuctuations of the returns for healthy subjects
are distinct from those with CHF. They also ﬂuctuate
over diﬀerent intervals, indicating that the returns data
for the healthy subjects ﬂuctuate over large interval. The
ﬂuctuations intervals are, −0.04 < x < 0.04 and −0.15 <
x < 0.15 for patients with CHF and healthy subjects,
respectively. Hence, we suggest that one may use the
drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients magnitudes, as well as the
ﬂuctuations intervals for the returns, for characterizing
the dynamics of human heartbeats, and to distinguish
healthy subjects from those with CHF.

I. DISCUSSIONS

Lin [30] argued that the daytime heart rate variability
of healthy subjects may exhibit discrete scale-invariance
(DSI). A stochastic process x(t) possesses continuous
scale-invariant symmetry if its distribution is preserved
under a change of variables, t → λt and x → x/µ, where
λ and µ are real numbers, so that,

x(t) =

x(λt) .

1
µ

(14)

If Eq.(14) holds only for a countable (discrete) set of val-
ues of λ, x(t) is said to possess DSI, which implies a
power-law behavior for x(t) that has a log-periodic cor-
rection of frequency 1/ log λ, so that

x(t) = tγF (log t/ log λ) ,

(15)

with, γ = log µ/ log λ, with F (x) = F (x + 1) being a pe-
riod scaling function. Generally speaking, one may write,
x(t) = c(t)tζ, with, ζ = γ + 2nπi/ log λ, with n = 1, 2, · · ·
The existence of log-periodicity was ﬁrst suggested by
Novikov [31] in small-scale energy cascade of turbulent
ﬂows. It has been argued [32] that log-periodicity may
exist in the dynamics of stock market crashes [33], turbu-
lence [34], earthquakes [35], diﬀusion in disordered mate-
rials [36,37], and in fracture of materials near the macro-
scopic fracture point [38]. The log-periodicity, if it exists
in the heart rate variability (HRV), implies the existence
of a cascade for the multifractal spectrum of HRV, pre-
viously reported by others. However, Lin’s method, nei-
ther provides a technique for distinguishing the HRV of
healthy people from those with CHF, nor can it predict
the future behavior of HRV based on some data at earlier
times.

The method proposed in the present paper is diﬀerent
from such analyses in that, the returns for the data are
analyzed in terms of Markov processes. Our analysis does
indicate the existence of correlations in the return which

D(2)(x), estimated by Eq. (8). For the healthy subjects (tri-
angles) and for patients with CHF (squares), D(1)(x) and
D(2)(x) follow linear and quadratic equations in x.

can be quite extended (and is characterized by the value
of the Markov time scale tM ).

II. SUMMARY

We distinguish the healthy subjects from those with
CHF in terms of the diﬀerences between the drift and
diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the Fokker-Plank equations that
we construct for the returns data which, in our view, pro-
vide a clearer and more physical way of understanding
the diﬀerences between the two groups of the subjects.
In addition, the reconstruction method suggested in this
paper enables one to predict the future trends in the re-
turns (and, hence, in the original series ri) over time
scales that are of the order of the Markov time scale tM .

None of the previous approaches for analyzing the data
could provide such a reconstruction method.

We also believe that, the computational method that
is described in this paper is more sensitive to small dif-
ferences between the data for healthy subjects and those
with CHF. As such, it might eventually provide a diag-
nostic tool for detection of CHF in patients with small
amounts of data and in its initial stages of development.

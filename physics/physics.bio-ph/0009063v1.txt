Abstract

mRNA editing in three sequences of Physarum polycephalum is analyzed. Once ﬁxed
the edited peptide chain, the nature of the inserted nucleotides and the position of the
insertion sites are explained by introducing a minimum principle in the framework of the
crystal basis model of the genetic code introduced by the authors.

One of the basic dogmas of molecular genetics states that the information contained in
DNA ﬂows faithfully, via the mRNA intermediate molecule, into the production of proteins.
In late eighties it has been discovered that the information contained in DNA is not always
found unmodiﬁed in the RNA products. It has been demonstrated that in several organisms
(kinetoplastid protozoa, mitochondria or chloroplasts of plants) some yet unknown biochemical
machinery alters the sequence of the ﬁnal transcriptions product. This process is called RNA
editing. Mainly three diﬀerent types of mRNA editing have been identiﬁed: insertion of urydine
(U); substitution of U by cytidine (C) and insertion of C. We consider in the following the
mRNA editing in Physarum polycephalum, ﬁrstly discovered in 1991 by R. Mahendran, M.
Spottswood and D. Miller [1]. We have analyzed 151 single insertions (144 C and 7 U) in three
published sequences of Physarum p. [1,2,3], remarking that the same amino acid chain could
have been obtained by insertion of C in a site diﬀerent from the observed one or by insertion of
a nucleotide diﬀerent from C or U. Here we show that the nature of the inserted nucleotide and
the position of the insertion site can be explained by introducing a minimum principle in the
framework of the crystal basis model of the genetic code introduced in Ref. [4]. In this model
any nucleotide sequence is characterized as an element of a vector space. A simple function is
deﬁned on this space, which takes in the observed conﬁguration a value smaller than the value
in the alternative conﬁgurations.

The mRNA editing in Physarum polycephalum has been extensively studied and it presents
the peculiar feature to be characterized mainly by C insertion. We concentrate our analysis
only on this biological species due to the high statistics of available data. Main feature of the
RNA editing in Physarum p.
is that in about 80 % of the cases the insertion occurs in the
third position of the codon, the insertion sites are non random and in about 68 % of the cases
the C is inserted after a purine-pyrimidine dinucleotide. Moreover no rule for the location of
the editing sites has been determined. We have analyzed three published sequences of mRNA
editing in portion of the ATP-9 Mitochondrial, of mRNA of Cytochrome c and b of Physarum
polycephalum [1, 2, 3], showing respectively, 54 insertions of a single C, 62 insertions (59 single
C, 1 single U) and 40 insertions (31 single C, 6 single U). We do not consider presently multiple
insertions and substitutions as the statistics is too low to derive any signiﬁcant conclusion. In
the whole of the analyzed sequences we have remarked:

1. the presence of at least 22 alternative insertion sites for C (15 % of the cases, see Table 2),
which would produce the same ﬁnal amino acids, so not altering the protein biosynthesis.
For example, at the insertion site 9 of Ref. [1], the (observed) sequence is ACC TTA (Thr
Leu), while the (unobserved) sequence with alternative insertion site may be ACT CTA.

2. in at least 108 (resp. 98 and 63) of the 144 single C insertions (75 %, resp. 68 % and
44 % of the cases, see Table 3), the same ﬁnal amino acid may have been obtained by a
single U (resp. A and G) insertion. Note that in writing Table 3, when the insertion site
is ambiguous, i.e. when the inserted C is next to another C, sometimes a shift has been
performed.

Moreover, we have to consider the two cases GCC UCU → GCU ACU – site 16′ – and CUU
AAA → UUA AAR – site 21* – where C insertion is replaced by an A or an R (R = A, G)
insertion together with a shift of the insertion site. A similar analysis has been performed for
the single U insertions.

This implies two natural questions: 1) why the insertion sites are the observed ones and not

the other ones ? 2) why the C insertion is largely preferred ?

In physics when a phenomenon occurs in one ﬁxed way between many possible choices, one
assumes that some minimum principle has to be satisﬁed. The simplest example is the straight

2

path of light (in absence of strong gravitation ﬁelds), corresponding to the shortest path between
two point in euclidean geometry (the so-called geodesics). Can we think of the existence of a
sort of minimum principle to explain mRNA editing and/or other process in DNA ? There are
several technical and conceptual diﬃculties in this way of tackling the problem. One should
give a mathematical modelisation of RNA and identify the sequence by a possibly discrete set of
variables. Deﬁning a topological metric space depending on discrete variables and introducing
on it a variation principle is a hard mathematical problem. Moreover we do not have a priori
any theoretical guidelines, such as the Hamiltonian and/or Lagrangian formalisms, so we must
have some good empirical grounding to begin with. In the present note, as a ﬁrst step, we
look for a simple function which would take the smallest value in the observed conﬁguration
of insertion sites and single C insertion, with respect to the conﬁguration with insertion in
alternative sites and/or with a single U, G, A insertion.

The starting point for a mathematical modelisation of DNA or mRNA is the crystal basis
model of the genetic code [4] where the nucleotides are assigned to the 4-dim irreducible fun-
damental representation (1/2, 1/2) of Uq→0(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)) and any sequence of N nucleotides
to the N-fold tensor product of (1/2, 1/2) (for codons, see [4] or Table 4 of [5], here reported
in Table 1 for completeness). Then we make the assumption that the location sites for the
insertion of a nucleotide should minimize the following function for the mRNA or cDNA

A0 = exp"−Xk

4α C k

H + 4β C k

V + 2γJ k

3,H#

(1)

where the sum in k is over all the codons in the edited sequence, C k
3,H, are the
values of the Casimir operator and of the third component of the generator of the H-sl(2) (V -
sl(2)), see [4], in the irreducible representation to which the k-th codon belongs, see Table 1.
Let us recall that the value of the Casimir operator on a state in an irreducible representation
(IR) labelled by (JH, JV ) is

V ) and J k

H (C k

CH (JH, JV ) = JH(JH + 1)

and CV (JH, JV ) = JV (JV + 1)

(2)

In (1) the simpliﬁed assumption that the dependence of A0 on the irreducible representation to
which the codon belongs is given only by the values of the Casimir operators has been made.
The parameters α, β, γ are constants, depending on the biological species.

The minimum of A0 has to be computed in the whole set of conﬁgurations satisfying to
the constraints:
i) the starting point should be the mtDNA and ii) the ﬁnal peptide chain
should not be modiﬁed. It is obvious that the global minimization of expression (1) is ensured
if A0 takes the smallest value locally, i.e.
in the neighborhood of each insertion site. The
choice of the function A0 is rather arbitrary; one of the reasons is that the chosen expression
is computationally quite easily tractable. If the parameters α, β, γ are strictly positive with
γ/6 > β > α, the minimization of (1) explains the observed conﬁgurations in all cases, except
for the cases 12, 33, 45 and 41* where there is equality and the cases 18* and 51* where the
minimization is not satisﬁed (see Table 2).

In order to deal with the remaining cases and to take into account the observed fact that
the dinucleotide preceding the insertion site is predominantly a purine-pyrimidine, we add to
the exponent of the function A0 an ”interaction term” which is equivalent to multiply (1) by
the function A1 where

A1 = exp"Xi

−4 ω1 j(i)
3,V

· j(i−1)

3,V + 4 ω2 j(i)

3,V

· j(i−2)

3,V #

(3)

3

3,V

The sum in i is over the insertion sites and j(i−n)
is the value of the third component of the
generator of V -sl(2) of the n-th nucleotide preceding the inserted nucleotide C (i.e. +1/2 for
C, U and −1/2 for G, A) and ω1, ω2 are constants, depending on the biological species.
In
the case where the insertion site cannot be unambiguously determined, i.e. when the inserted
nucleotide is next to a nucleotide of the same type, (3) should be computed in the conﬁguration
which minimizes the value of A1.
If ω1 > ω2 > 0 and ω1 > 12α the minimization of the
function A = A0 A1 explains all the observed positions for C insertions, see Table 2.
It is
reasonable, but not taken into account in (1), to argue that the insertion sites and the nature
of the inserted nucleotides also depend on the content of the particular sequence. Moreover A
might be considered as the ﬁrst terms of a development, next terms involving representations
corresponding to more than one codon, the nature of the nucleotides following the insertion
site, etc. These further terms may play a role in a more reﬁned analysis.

An analysis of the 7 single U insertions shows that in 6 cases – sites 22*, 10′, 18′, 22′, 24′,
26′ – (resp. 3 cases – sites 10′, 18′, 24′ –) the replacement U → C (resp. U → R) gives the
same amino acid. In 4 of these cases the minimization of eq. (1) should prefer the insertion of
C, giving rise to UUU → UUC, site 22*; CUU → CUC, sites 10′, 18′; ACU → ACC, site 24′,
while in sites 22′, 26′ UUA is more preferred than CUA. This may explain why the U insertions
are so rare compared with the C insertions. Also in this case further terms in A may help for
a more reﬁned analysis of the preferred conﬁguration of the insertions.

In conclusion our eﬀective model does not explain why and where mRNA editing occurs in
Physarum polycephalum, but it seems to be able to determine the location sites and the nature
of inserted nucleotides, once ﬁxed the amino acid chain. Indeed in 110 of the 114 sites in which
the insertion of C or U, and in all the cases where also an insertion of purine can produce the
same amino acid, the observed mRNA editing makes use of the nucleotide C or U which does
minimize A. It is natural to argue that mRNA editing in other biological organism in which
the U insertion is preferred may be governed by an analogous expression of eqs. (1)-(3) with
diﬀerent values of the constants. It is our program to investigate the RNA editing in other
biological species.

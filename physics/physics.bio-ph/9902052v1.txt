Abstract

We present a model of a coupled system of the olfactory bulb and cortex. Odor
inputs to the epithelium are transformed to oscillatory bulbar activities. The cor-
tex recognizes the odor by resonating to the bulbar oscillating pattern when the
amplitude and phase patterns from the bulb match an odor memory stored in the
intracortical synapses. We assume a cortical structure which transforms the odor
information in the oscillatory pattern to a slow DC feedback signal to the bulb.
This feedback suppresses the bulbar response to the pre-existing odor, allowing
subsequent odor objects to be segmented out for recognition.

Key words: olfaction; detection; recognition; segmentation; adaptation

1 Introduction

There is a great deal of current interest in how neural systems, both artiﬁcial
and natural, can use top-down feedback to modulate input processing. Here
we propose a minimal model for an olfactory system in which feedback en-
ables it to perform an essential task – olfactory segmentation. Most olfactory
systems need to detect, recognize, and segment odor objects. Segmentation is
necessary because diﬀerent odors give overlapping activity patterns on odor
receptor neurons, of which there are hundreds of types (1), and each has a
broad spectrum of response to diﬀerent odor molecules (2). Diﬀerent odor
objects seldom enter the environment in the same sniﬀ cycle, but they often
stay together in the environment afterwards. Humans usually can not iden-
tify the individual odor objects in mixtures (3), although they easily perceive

an incoming odor superposed on pre-existing ones. Our model performs odor
segmentation temporally: First one odor is detected and encoded by the olfac-
tory bulb and recognized by the associative memory circuits of the olfactory
cortex. Then the cortex gives an odor-speciﬁc feedback to the bulb to inhibit
the response or adapt to this odor, so that a superposed second odor arriv-
ing later can be detected and recognized with undiminished sensitivity while
the sensitivity to the pre-existing odor is reduced, as observed psychophysi-
cally (3). The stimulus-speciﬁc feedback makes odor adaptation an intelligent
computational strategy, unlike simple fatigue, which is not suﬃcient for odor
segmentation. Our model displays the oscillatory neural activities in the bulb
and cortex as observed physiologically (4). Furthermore, odor cross-adaptation
— the suppression and distortion of odor perception immediately after an ex-
posure to another odor — as observed psychophysically (3), is a consequence
of this model.

2 The Model

Our model (Fig. 1) describes the essential elements of primary olfactory neural
circuitry: the olfactory bulb, the olfactory cortex, and feedforward and feed-
back coupling between them. The formal neurons in our system model the
collective activity of local populations of real neurons. The synaptic architec-
ture is consistent with the known physiology and anatomy of the olfactory
system in most mammalian species (5).

Our bulb model contains interacting excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule
cells, with membrane potentials xi and yi respectively, and ﬁring rates gx(xi)
and gy(yi) respectively (see (6) and (7) for details). The odor input Ii drives

turn (2) determines the matrix A, which then (3) determines whether the bulb
will give spontanous oscillatory outputs and, if it does, the oscillation pattern
X1 and frequency ω1.

The mitral cell outputs gx(xi) are transformed to an eﬀective input I b
i to
the excitatory (pyramidal) cells of the cortex by (1) a convergent-divergent
bulbar-cortex connection matrix and (2) an eﬀective high-pass ﬁltering via
feedforward interneurons in the cortex. Our cortical model is structurally sim-
ilar to that of the bulb. We focus only on the upper layer pyramidal cells and
feedback interneurons:

where u, v, and ˜W0 correspond to x, y, and W0 for the bulb. J0 is global
excitatory-to-excitatory connections, β0 and γ0 are local synaptic couplings.

Carrying out the same kind of linearization around the ﬁxed point (¯u, ¯v) as
in the bulb, we obtain a system of driven coupled oscillators. With appro-
priate cell nonlinearities and overall scale of the synaptic connections, the
system does not oscillate spontaneously, nor does it respond much to random
or irrelevant inputs. However, the cortex will resonate vigorously when the
driving oscillatory force Ib matches one of intrinsic oscillatory modes ~ξµ in
frequency and patterns amplitudes and phases. These intrinsic modes ~ξµ for
µ = 1, 2, ...P , are memory items in an associative memory system (8; 9; 10),
and can be stored in the synapses J0 and ˜W0 in a generalized Hebb-Hopﬁeld

Fig. 2. A, B, C: bulbar and cortical oscillation patterns for odors A, B (stored)
and C (not stored) for 5 of the 50 mitral and cortical excitatory neurons in the
model. The cortex-to-bulb feedback is turned oﬀ in the simulation for simplicity.

It was shown in (7) that a suitable DC feedback signal to suppress the odor-
speciﬁc activity in the bulb is dIc = H−
1αdI. Somehow, this feedback should
be constructed from the cortical outputs that contains the odor information.
We do not know how this is done in cortical circuitry, so we treat this part
of the problem phenomenologically. First, we transform the AC signal in the
pyramidal cell output gu(ui) to a slow DC like signal by thresholding gu(ui)
and then passing it through two successive very slow leaky integrators. One can
then easily construct a synaptic connection matrix to transform this signal to
the desired feedback signal for the odor input that evoked the cortical output
gu(u) in the past sniﬀs.

Feedback signal slowly builds up and the adaptation to odor A becomes eﬀec-
tive at the second sniﬀ (Fig. 3A), and the system responds to odor A+B at the
third sniﬀ in a way as if only odor B were present (Fig. 3B), achieving odor
adaptation and segmentation consistent with human behavior. Quantitative
analysis conﬁrms that the response to the segmented odor B in the third sniﬀ is
about 98% similar to that of response to odor B alone. Simulations show that
odor adaptation eventually achieves an equilibrium level when insigniﬁcant
residual responses to background odors maintain a steady feedback signal. A
consequence of the model is olfactory cross-adaptation, when the background

odor A is suddenly removed and odor B is presented. The feedback signal or
background adaptation to odor A persists for a while and signiﬁcantly distorts
(and suppresses) the response to, and thus the percept of, odor B (Fig. (3C)),
as observed psychophysically (3).

3 Discussion

We have augmented the bulb model developed in earlier work by one of us
(6; 7) with a model of the pyriform cortex and with feedforward and feedback
connections between it and the bulb. It is a minimal computational model for
how an olfactory system can detect, recognize and segment odors. As far as
we know, this is the simplest system consistent with anatomical knowledge
that can perform these three tasks, all of which are fundamental for olfaction.
Our model does not deal with other computational tasks, such as hierachical
catagorization of odors (10).

The resonant associative memory recognition mechanism and the slow feed-
back to the granule (inhibitory) neurons of the bulb are essential parts of our
model, but many of the details of the present treatment are not. For example,

5

the slow feedback signal could be implemented by many other mechanisms,
but it must be slow. These essential features are necessary in order that the
model be consistent with the observed phenomenology of the olfactory system.

In this paper we investigate error-thresholds on dynamics ﬁtness-landscapes. We show that there
exists both lower and an upper threshold, representing limits to the copying ﬁdelity of simple
replicators. The lower bound can be expressed as a correction term to the error-threshold present
on a static landscape. The upper error-threshold is a new limit that only exists on dynamic ﬁtness-
landscapes. We also show that for long genomes on highly dynamic ﬁtness-landscapes there exists a
lower bound on the selection pressure needed to enable eﬀective selection of genomes with superior
ﬁtness independent of mutation rates, i.e., there are distinct limits to the evolutionary parameters
in dynamic environments.

Ever since Eigen’s work on replicating molecules in
1971 [1], the concept of quasi-species has proven to be a
very fruitful way of modeling the fundamental behavior
of evolution. A quasi-species is an equilibrium distribu-
tion of closely related gene sequences, localized around
one or a few sequences with high ﬁtness. The combi-
nation of simplicity and mathematical preciseness makes
it possible to isolate the eﬀects of diﬀerent fundamental

capture some general phenomena in nature, such as the
critical relation between mutation rate and information
transmission [1,2]. The kinetics of these simple systems
has been studied in great detail as the formulation has
allowed many of the techniques of statistical physics to
be applied to replicator and evolutionary systems. See
for instance [1–15].

The appearance in these models of an error-threshold
(or error-catastrophy) as an upper bound on the muta-
tion rate, above which no eﬀective selection can occur,
has important implications for biological systems. In par-
ticular it places limits on the maintainable amounts of ge-
netic information [1,2,16] which puts strong restrictions
on possible theories for the origins of life. It is interest-
ing to note that some RNA-viruses seem to have evolved
mutation rates that are close to the error-threshold [2]
[16].

Studies of quasi-species until now have focused on
static ﬁtness-landscapes. Many organisms in nature
however live in a quickly changing environment [17].
This is especially important for viruses and other mi-
crobial pathogens that must survive in a host with an
highly dynamic immune system for which there only ex-
ist tight and temporary niches with high ﬁtness (for the
pathogen).

In this paper we investigate how the critical mutation
rate of the error threshold is aﬀected by a dynamical
ﬁtness-landscape. We show how the critical mutation

rate is lowered by shifts of the ﬁtness-peak. An sim-
ple analytical expression for this critical copying ﬁdelity
is also presented. It also turns out that if the selection
pressure is too small, the ﬁtness-landscape moves too fast
and the ﬁtness encoding genome is too large, the popu-
lation will lose the ﬁtness-peak independent of mutation
rate. This shows the existence of regions in parameter
space where no selection can occur despite possibilities
of adjusting copying-ﬁdelity.

In brief a quasi-species consists of a population of self-
replicating genomes represented by a sequence of bases
sk, (s1s2 · · · sn). Hereafter we will assume binary bases
{1, 0} and that all sequences have equal length n though
these restrictions are easily relaxed. Every genome is
then given by a binary string (011001 · · ·), which can be
represented by an integer k (0 ≤ k < 2n).

To describe how mutations aﬀect a population we de-
ﬁne W l
k as the probability that replication of genome l
gives genome k as oﬀspring. For perfect copying accu-
racy, W l
k equals the identity matrix. Mutations however
give rise to oﬀ diagonal elements in W l
k. Since the genome
length is ﬁxed to n we will only consider point mutations,
which conserve the genome length.

We assume that the point mutation rate p = 1 − q
(where q is the copying accuracy per base) is constant in
time and independent of position in the genome. We can
then write an explicit expression for W l
k in terms of the
copying ﬁdelity:

W l

k = phklqn−hkl = qn

(1)

hkl

1 − q
q

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where hkl is the Hamming distance between genomes k
and l, and n is the genome length. The Hamming dis-
tance hkl is deﬁned as the number of positions where
genomes k and l diﬀer.

The equations describing the dynamics of the popula-
tion now take a relatively simple form. Let xk denote

1

the relative concentration and Ak the ﬁtness of genome
k. We then obtain the rate equations:

˙xk =

To create a dynamic landscape we consider a single
peaked ﬁtness landscape [2] whose peak moves, result-
ing in diﬀerent optimal gene sequences at diﬀerent times.
Formally we can write Ak(t) = σ and Al = 1 ∀l 6= k(t)
where the (changing) genome k(t) describes how the peak
If k(t) is constant in
moves through sequence space.
time the rate equation [Eq. 2] corresponds to the classi-
cal (static) theory of quasi-species studied by Eigen and
others.

We allow the peak in the ﬁtness landscape to move
to one of its closest neighbors (chosen ranomly). In this
paper we assume that movements occur with a ﬁxed fre-
quency but one could also consider a probabilistic move-
ment.

The mutation matrix W describes point mutations
which occurr with equal probability independent of po-
sition in the genome. This imposes a symmetry on the
rate equations, dividing the relative concentrations into
error classes Γi described by their Hamming distance i
from the master sequence (Γ0). This reduces the eﬀec-
tive dimension of the sequence space from 2n to n + 1
thereby making the problem analytically tractable. The
use of assymetric evolution operators (such as recombina-
tion) or ﬁtness landscapes is obviously signiﬁcantly more
problematic and is the subject of ongoing work. When
the ﬁtness peak moves this landscape symmetry will be
broken since one sequence in Γ1 will be singled out as
the new master sequence. This would only aﬀect the re-
sults we present below if the mean time between shifts
in the ﬁtness-landscape was small — as there would then
be a substantial concentration of the old master sequence
present when the peak moves back into this error-class.
We assume the dynamics to be slow enough for this not
to be a problem.

Moving the ﬁtness peak then corresponds to applying
the following co-ordinate transformation to the concen-
tration vector:

To study the population dynamics we may divide the dy-

ter determining the number of generations between shifts
of the ﬁtness peak when the evolution proceeds as for a
static landscape. We then apply the R transformation

to the concentration vector. The resulting concentration
distribution is used as the initial condition for the rate
equations from time τ to 2τ and so on. These popula-
tion dynamics [Eq. 2 and R] may be solved numerically as
shown in Fig. 1 (after the initial transient) where τ = 5,
σ = 10, q = 0.999 and string-length n = 50.

A simple approximation of the model presented above
enables us to derive analytical expressions for the error-
thresholds on a dynamic ﬁtness-landscape. Neglecting
back mutations into the master-sequence, we can write
the rate equation for the master-sequence on a static
ﬁtness-landscape as

˙xmas = Qσxmas − exmas

(4)

where Q = qn is the copying ﬁdelity of the whole genome
and e = σxmas +1−xmas. The asymptotic concentration
of master-sequences is

xmas (t) →

when t → ∞

(5)

This implies that the error-threshold on a static ﬁtness-
landscape occurs when

Qσ − 1
σ − 1

Qstat =

1
σ

(6)

(see e.g.,
[1,2]). This result is also intuitively clear
since the superior ﬁtness (and hence growth rate) of the
master-sequence must compensate for the loss of Γ0 indi-
viduals due to mutations that occur during replication.
The intuitive picture of the error-threshold on a dy-
namic ﬁtness-landscape is diﬀerent: what determines the
critical mutation rate is whether the master-sequence will
have time to regrow between the shifts of the ﬁtness-
peak. To ﬁnd an analytical approximation for the error-
treshold we have to expand Eq. (4) to include the dynam-
ics of error-class one as well as the master-sequence. This
is necessary since the ﬁtness-peak moves into error-class
one every τ time-steps. We can, however, make a large
simpliﬁcation by assuming the growth of the master-
sequence to be in the exponential regime, i.e., that we can

neglect the non-linearity in Eq. (4). This is a good ap-
proximation near the error-threshold as, for these values
of q, the master-sequence will not have time to approach
any kind of equilibrium before the peak shifts again. We
can thus write an approximation of the rate equations
for the master-sequence and a representative member of
error-class one:

˙xmas = (Qσ − 1) xmas

˙x1j = ˜Qσxmas + (Q − 1)x1j

(7)

where mutations into the member of error-class one are
neglected and ˜Q = (1 − q) qn−1 describes mutation from
xmas into x1j . We now assume x1j (0) = 0, which is a
good approximation since x1j is (almost always) in Γ2 be-
fore the shift. The solutions to Eq. (7) using this bound-
ary condition can be written as

xmas (t) = xmas (0) e(qnσ−1)t

x1i (t) = xmas (0)

e(qnσ−1)t − e(qn−1)t
(σ − 1) q

(cid:1)

  (cid:0)

(1 − q) σ

!

The shifting involves the move of the ﬁtness peak to
one of the sequences in error-class one at time t = τ .
The initial concentration of master-sequences at the be-
ginning of a shift cycle is therefore xmas (0) = x1 (τ ).
If the concentration of the master-sequence after the
shift is lower than immediately after the previous shift,
i.e. xmas (0) > x1 (τ ), the distribution of concentra-
tions will converge towards a uniform distribution. This
is, in eﬀect, a deﬁnition of the error-threshold. A con-
dition for eﬀective selection is then given by inserting
xmas (0) < x1 (τ ) into Eq. (8). We then derive a master-
sequence growth parameter

It is not possible to ﬁnd exact analytical solutions
for the roots of Eq. (9) and hence the error-thresholds.
Fig. 2 shows the region where Eq. (9) can be expected to
hold. The ﬁgure also shows the existence of two error-
thresholds, qdyn
corresponding to the real roots
of κ = 1. The lower threshold is a new version of
the static error-threshold, with a pertubation resulting
from the movement of the ﬁtness-landscape. The upper
threshold is a new phenomenon that appears only on dy-
namic ﬁtness-landscapes. Its existence is intuitively clear
— if the mutation rate is very close to zero, there will not
be enough individuals present on the new peak position
when the shift occurrs to maintain a steady occupancy of
the master sequence, i.e. the peak moves out from under
the quasi-species and the population will not be able to
track shifts in the ﬁtness-landscape.

Both the qualitative and quantitative dynamics of both

The critical copying ﬁdelity Qdyn

depends on the
genome-length. This is not surprising since the ﬁtness-
peak shifts into a speciﬁc member of Γ1, which consists
of n diﬀerent gene-sequences.
It is, however, a direct
consequence of the dynamic ﬁtness-landscape since the
static error-threshold is independent of genome-length.
This eﬀect is demonstrated in Fig. 4, where Qdyn
ver-
sus the genome-length is plotted. The perturbation from
the static error-threshold increases with genome-length.
The derivative is however decreasing and for reasonable
values of τ ≫ 1 and σ ≫ 1 the static and dynamic error-
threshold are of the same order of magnitude and show
the same scaling behaviour.

An analytical approximation to the new upper thresh-

(12)

Explicit numerical solutions of the full dynamics con-
ﬁrm that this threshold exsists and is predicted by
Eq. (12). For most values of σ and τ , qdyn
is very close to
1 (e.g. (σ − 1) τ = 50 gives 10−22 as a lower bound on the
mutation rate per base pair). Finite population aﬀects
are however signiﬁcant for the upper error-threshold. In
real biological populations this may be imposrtant. More
detailed studies of these issues are under preparation.

It is important to note that qdyn

will then depend strongly on the genome-length.

This means that as the genome-length increases, the
(cid:16)
evolvable gap in between the two error-thresholds nar-
rows.

(cid:17)

On a static ﬁtness-landscape it is always possible to
ﬁnd copying ﬁdelities high enough for evolution to be
eﬀective.
It turns out that this is no longer the case
for dynamic ﬁtness-landscapes. There exist regions in
parameter-space (spanned by σ, τ and n) where solutions
to Eq. (9) cease to exist. This happens when the upper
and lower error-thresholds coincide or, to put it diﬀer-
ently, when the maximum (taken over q) of the left hand
side of Eq. (9) become less than 1. To ﬁnd this conver-
gence point it is better to search for a direct approxima-
tion of q that maximizes the left hand side of Eq. (9) as
the approximations for upper and lower error-thresholds
given above become less accurate when they are close to-
gether, To do this we assume the leading behaviour is
determined by the factor e(qnσ−1)τ (1 − q). Taking the
derivative of this expression and setting it to zero gives
the equation qn−1 (1 − q) = 1
nστ . Assuming q to be very
close to 1, and hence qn−1 ≈ 1 gives

This approximation for qmax can be substituted into
Eq. (9). It is easy ﬁnd points in phase space where this
inequality starts to hold by ﬁxing two parameters (e.g.,
τ and n) and then numerically solving for the third (σ).
Table II shows the minimal height of the ﬁtness-peak for
diﬀerent values of τ and n. The required selective pres-
sure becomes large for fast moving ﬁtness-landscapes and
large genome lengths.

In conclusion we have shown existence of, and derived
analytic expressions for, two error-thresholds on a simple
dynamic ﬁtness-landscape. The lower threshold is a per-
turbation of the well known error-catastrophy that exists
a static ﬁtness-landscape that accounts for the destabi-
lizing eﬀect of the changing environment. The existence
of an upper bound on the copying ﬁdelity is a new phe-
nomenon, only existing in dynamic environments. The
presence of this upper bound results in the existence of
critical regions of the landscape parameters (σ, τ and n)
where the two thresholds coincide (or cross) and threre-
fore no eﬀective selection can occur. Thus dynamics land-
scapes have strong constraints on evolvability.

A Simple Model of Evolution with Variable System Size

Claus Wilke and Thomas Martinetz

A simple model of biological extinction with variable system size is presented that exhibits a
power-law distribution of extinction event sizes. The model is a generalization of a model recently
introduced by Newman. Both analytical and numerical analysis show that the exponent of the
power-law distribution depends only marginally on the growth rate g at which new species enter the
system and is equal to the one of the original model in the limit g → ∞. A critical growth rate gc
can be found below which the system dies out. Under these model assumptions stable ecosystems
can only exist if the regrowth of species is suﬃciently fast.

PACS numbers: 87.10.+e, 05.40.+j

The fact that extinction events seem to be episodic
on all scales, as noted by Raup [1], has aroused much
interest in the last few years. Throughout the history
of life on earth there have been many small extinction
events, but rarely very big ones have happened. A his-
togram of the frequency of extinction events of diﬀer-
ent sizes indicates a power law distribution p(s) = s−τ ,
where s denotes the number of species that go extinct
in one event and p(s) denotes the frequency of events of
size s.
It has been conjectured that this power-law is
the result of the competitive dynamic between species.
Ecosystems might drive themselves into a critical state
where little change (e.g. the mutation of a single species)
can trigger an “avalanche” that may span the whole sys-
tem. For this kind of dynamic Bak et al. [2] have coined
the name Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). Several sim-
ple models of evolution exhibiting SOC have been pro-
posed, among them models by Kauﬀman and Johnsen [3],
Bak and Sneppen [4], Manrubia and Paczuski [5]. These
models act on species rather than on individuals.

Recently, Newman and Sneppen [6] introduced a new
class of models. These so called “coherent noise” models
are clearly not SOC but nevertheless show a power law
distribution of avalanche sizes. Newman [7] compared
such a model with the analysis of the fossil record per-
formed by Raup. For his model he found an exponent
τ close to 2, which is in good agreement with the fossil
record. Thus Newman came to the conclusion that there
is no evidence for SOC as the major driving force for
extinction.

However, the above mentioned models have one major
drawback. In all these models the system size is kept con-
stant and species that go extinct are replaced by new ones
instantaneously. This is in clear contrast to the biologi-
cal reality. After a major extinction event, the number of
species in the ecosystem is signiﬁcantly reduced, and the
process of regrowth of new species can take a long time.
The fossil record [10] shows that it is common that the
process of growth of species is interupted by extinction
events.

The ﬁrst approach to tackle the problem of a variable
number of species was an extension of the Bak-Sneppen
model [4] to a growing tree model, done by Vandewalle
and Ausloos [8]. Nevertheless, this is rather a model to
study the structure of phylogenetic trees but to study ex-
tinction events. Another model, proposed by Head and
Rodgers [9], shows an increasing number of species un-
til some typical system size has been reached. Then the
number of species ﬂuctuates about this value, major ex-
tinction events do not occur.

We here propose a generalization to the coherent noise
model used by Newman, where the reﬁlling of the sys-
tem is done in ﬁnite time. Newman’s model is deﬁned
as follows. The system consists of N species, each pos-
sessing a threshold xi of tolerance against stress, cho-
sen from a probablity distribution pthresh(x). At each
time-step, a stress η is generated at random with a dis-
tribution pstress(η), and all species with xi < η are re-
moved from the system and immediately replaced with
new ones. Furthermore, a small fraction f of the species
is chosen at random and given new thresholds. That cor-
responds to a probability of f for every species to undergo
spontaneous mutation.

In our model the fraction of species with xi < η is re-
moved permanently from the system, but in every time-
step there is some growth of new species.

The natural way to deﬁne the regrowth of the species

is logistic growth,

dN
dt

= gN (1 − N
Nmax

) ,

(1)

where g is the growth rate and Nmax the maximal system
size, imposed by external constraints. Since our model is
discrete, in time as well as in the number of species, in-
stead of (1) we use the corresponding diﬀerence equation

∆N (t + ∆t) =

N (t)Nmaxeg∆t
Nmax + N (t)(eg∆t − 1)

− N (t) ,

(2)

where ∆t is one simulation time-step (usually set equal
to 1). As ∆N has to be an integer, we use the frac-
tional part of ∆N as probability to round up or down.

1

In the limit g → 0 (which corresponds to ∆t → 0) Equa-
In the limit g → ∞
tion (2) reduces to Equation (1).
Equation (2) becomes ∆N = Nmax − N , which means
that our model reduces to the original one in the limit of
an inﬁnite growth rate.

Now we can formulate our model: We set ∆t = 1. At
every time step, a stress value η is chosen and all species
with xi < η are removed. Then, an amount ∆N of new
species is introduced into the system. Finally, a fraction
f of the species is assigned new thresholds.

A typical evolution of the system size N in time is pre-
sented in Figure 1. The process of growth of new species
is constantly disrupted by small extinction events. From
time to time, bigger events occur which disturb the sys-
tem signiﬁcantly. A plot of the distribution of extinction
events (Figure 2) shows a power-law decrease. Variation
of the growth rate over several orders of magnitude does
change the exponent only slightly.

We can explain the exponent of the power-law by ex-
tending the analysis of Sneppen and Newman to our
model. The probability that species leave a small inter-
vall dx of the time averaged distribution ¯ρ(x) is propor-
tional to (f + pmove(x))¯ρ(x), where pmove(x) is the prob-
ability that a species with threshold x is hit by stress.
Let α be a variable that meassures the “emptiness” of
the system, i.e. α ∝ (1 − N/Nmax). The rate at which
the intervall dx is repopulated is then proportional to
(f (1 − α) + gα(1 − α))pthresh(x) in the limit ∆t → 0.
In equilibrium the rates of species loss and repopulation
balance, and we ﬁnd the master-equation

(f + pmove(x))¯ρ(x) = (f (1 − ¯α) + g ¯α(1 − ¯α))pthresh(x) .

(3)

Note that we had to replace α by its time-averaged value
¯α and that we can always take the limit ∆t → 0 in the
steady-state. After rearranging Equation (3), we ﬁnd

¯ρ(x) = (f (1 − ¯α) + g ¯α(1 − ¯α))

pthresh(x)
f + pmove(x)

.

(4)

Equation (4) can be solved if we choose how to normalize
¯ρ(x) and ¯α. Since we can think of the system as contain-
ing Nmax species at any time step, from which there are
N active and Nmax −N dead, it makes sense to normalize
the sum of ¯α and ¯ρ(x) to unity, viz.

1 = ¯α +

¯ρ(x)dx .

Z

(5)

That implies, on the other hand, that we do not nor-
malize ¯ρ(x) to unity. Rather,
¯ρ(x)dx gives the ratio
¯N /Nmax.

R

For ¯α we ﬁnd, apart from the trivial solution ¯α = 1,

the solution ¯α = (A − f )/g, with

−1 =

A

pthresh(x)
f + pmove(x)

dx .

Z

For ¯ρ(x), we ﬁnd

¯ρ(x) = A

1 − A − f

(cid:18)

g (cid:19)

pthresh(x)
f + pmove(x)

.

(7)

We thus have the interesting result that apart from the
overall factor 1 − ¯α, which determines the average system
size, the shape of ¯ρ(x) is identical to that found by Snep-
pen and Newman. Since only the shape ¯ρ(x) but not the
overall factor is responsible for the power-law distribu-
tion of extinction events (for details see [6]) we ﬁnd that
within the time averaged approximation the exponent τ
of the power-law decrease is exactly the same as in the
original model, even for very small g.

If we take the limit g → ∞ in Equation (7) we can
restore the expression found by Sneppen and Newman,
which was to be expected since our model reduces to the
original one in that limit. In the region of very small g,
we can read oﬀ from Equation (7) that the system breaks
down at a critical growth rate gc = A − f . This is the
case when the growth rate is so small that the regrowth
of species cannot compensate the successive extinction
events. Every system with g < gc will eventually end up
with N = 0, regardless of the number of species at the
beginning of the simulation.

For the simulation results presented here we have used
i.e., pstress(η) =
exponentially distributed stress only,
exp(−η/σ)/σ. Figure 3 shows the dependence of the av-
erage system size ¯N of g. We can clearly see the break-
down of the system at gc. A measurement of the time-
averaged distribution of thresholds ¯ρ(x) is presented in
Figure 4. The exponent τ of the power-law distribution
of extinction events is found to be τ = 1.9±0.1 for g = 10,
τ = 2.0±0.1 for g = 0.002, τ = 2.05±0.1 for g = 4×10−5
(for exponentially distributed stress, σ = 0.05, f = 10−5,
Figure 2). The exponent is slightly decreasing with in-
creasing g. For g = 10, we have already good agreement
with the exponent found by Newman and Sneppen [6] for
g = ∞, viz. τ = 1.85 ± 0.03.

An interesting feature of the original model by New-
man and Sneppen is the existence of aftershocks, a series
of smaller events following a large one. These aftershocks
have their origin in the fact that after a large event the in-
troduction of new species reduces signiﬁcantly the mean
threshold value, and thus increases the probability to get
further events. Since the existence of aftershocks is a
result of the immediate reﬁlling of the system after an
event, we cannot necessarily expect to see aftershocks
when the reﬁlling is done in ﬁnite time, especially with
a small growth rate. Numerical simulations show that
there are aftershocks for larger values of g, but when g
approaches gc, aftershocks cannot clearly be identiﬁed
anymore. The region where this happens is where the
average system size decreases rapidly with g. For these
values of g, the typical time the system needs to regrow

(6)

2

the amount of species lost in a major event exceeds the
typical time needed to create a major stress value.
In
Figure 3, the region where we do not ﬁnd aftershocks is
between g = gc = 1.3 × 10−5 and about g = 5 × 10−4. A
typical example for a series of events in a system with g
close to gc is presented in Figure 5.

Sneppen and Newman argued that the existence of af-
tershocks might provide a measure to distinguish between
coherent-noise driven systems and SOC systems. This is
certainly true in the sense that systems exhibiting af-
tershocks are good candidates for coherent-noise driven
systems rather than SOC systems. But our simulations
show that there are systems without clear aftershocks
that still should be classiﬁed as coherent-noise driven.

We have focused on logistic growth since we believe it
is most common in natural phenomena. In principle it is
possible to use diﬀerent types of growth. We have done
some simulations with linear growth, where in every time-
step a ﬁxed amount of new species is introduced into the
system, as long as N < Nmax. These simulations indicate
that the respective type of growth used does not aﬀect
the appearance of a power-law distribution with exponent
almost independent of the growth rate. But whether or
not aftershocks appear is indeed dependend on the type
of growth.
In such a system with linear growth after-
shocks can be seen clearly even for small growth rates.

If we want to use a coherent noise model with variable
system size as a model of biological evolution, some re-
marks about the meaning of Nmax are necessary. It is a
ﬁrst step closer to reality to allow regrowth of species in
ﬁnite time, instead of immediate reﬁlling of the system.
But for ecosystems it is certainly not a good assumption
to keep the maximal system size Nmax ﬁxed, since the
number of species an ecosystem can contain depends on
the interaction of the species themselves. Therefore, a
next step could be to change Nmax after every extinc-
tion, e.g., up or down by chance and by an amount pro-
portional to the size of the event. This is motivated by
the fact that one would expect bigger events to be corre-
lated with a more profound restructuring of the ecosys-
tem. Simulations show that we still ﬁnd power-law dis-
tributions with exponents τ ≈ 2. The behaviour of such
a system has a very rich structure with long times of rel-
atively little change (stasis) and sudden bursts of evolu-
tionary activity (punctuated equlibrium), where a major
extinction event is followed by regrowth of species to a
system size much bigger then the one before the event.
The so found curves of the system size N agree qualita-
tively well with the fossil record [10].

We have generalized a coherent noise model to a model
with variable system size. The most important feature
of coherent noise models, the power-law distriubtion of
event sizes with an exponent close to 2, does not change
under the generalization. Thus the validity of Newman’s
approach to explain biological extinction with a coher-
ent noise model is not aﬀected by the regrowth of species

in ﬁnite time. An interesting new feature that emerges
from a variable system size is the existence of a critical
growth rate gc. Systems with g < gc will always end
up with N = 0 after some time. Therefore in a world
where the regrowth of species is too slow to compensate
external inﬂuences no stable ecosystems can exist. In the
framework of our model we conclude that the process of
mutation and diversiﬁcation of species at suﬃciently high
rate is necessary for the stability of life on earth.

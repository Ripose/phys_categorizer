We study an autocatalytic system consisting of several interacting chemical species. We observe a
strong dependence of the concentrations of the chemicals on the size of the system. This dependence
is caused by the discrete nature of the molecular concentrations. Two basic mechanisms responsible
for them are identiﬁed and elucidated. The relevance of the transitions to processes in biochemical
systems and in micro-reactors is brieﬂy discussed.

PACS numbers: 87.16.-b, 05.40.-a

Rate equations are often employed in the study of bio-
chemical reaction processes. In rate equations, the quan-
tities of chemicals are treated as continuous variables,
and the actual discreteness of the molecular concentra-
tion is ignored [5]. In many biochemical processes, how-
ever, some chemicals play important roles at extremely
low concentrations, amounting to only a few molecules
per cell [1]. Furthermore, there exist ampliﬁcation mech-
anisms involving enzymes in cells through which even a
change by one molecule in a cell can result in drastic ef-
fects. In such situations, the discreteness of the molecular
concentration is obviously not negligible.

We previously showed the existence of a novel transi-
tion induced by the discreteness of the molecular concen-
tration in an autocatalytic reaction system [2]. The sys-
tem contains four chemicals Xi(i = 1, · · · , 4). We consid-
ered an autocatalytic reaction network (loop) represented
by Xi + Xi+1 → 2Xi+1 (with X5 ≡ X1) within a con-
tainer that is in contact with a reservoir of molecules.
Through interaction with the reservoir, each molecule
species Xi diﬀuses in and out at a total rate of DisiV ,
where Di is the ﬂow rate, si the concentration of chemical
Xi in the reservoir, and V the volume of the container. In
this system, a novel state appears as a result of ﬂuctua-
tions and the discreteness of the molecular concentration,
characterized as extinction and subsequent reemergence
of molecule species alternately in the autocatalytic reac-
tion loop.

When the volume of the container is small, Ni, the
number of molecules of species Xi, may go to 0 (i.e. be-
come extinct) through a ﬁnite-size ﬂuctuation due to the
discreteness of the molecular concentration. Once Ni
reaches 0, it remains 0 until an Xi molecule ﬂows in.
Thus, if the ﬂow rate of molecules is suﬃciently small,
state with N1 = N3 = 0 or N2 = N4 = 0 can be re-
alized. In a state with N2, N4 ≈ 0 (a “1-3 rich” state),
switches between states with N1 > N3 and N3 > N1 can
occur, and similarly for a state with N1, N3 ≈ 0 (a “2-
4 rich” state). A symmetry-breaking transition to these
states was observed in our previous study. This is a novel
discreteness-induced transition (DIT) occurring with the

decrease of V .

In the system investigated in our previous work, the
long-term average concentration of each chemical does
not diﬀer from that in the continuum limit, since the
system over time switches between the two states of bro-
ken symmetry. It is important to determine if there are
systems for which the average concentrations of chemi-
cals are signiﬁcantly altered by the DIT. We will show
that this is possible in a system possessing some kind of
asymmetry, as in the case of a ﬁrst order phase transition.
This result is biologically signiﬁcant as providing a pos-
sible description of the alteration of the concentrations
of some molecules within cells.

To investigate this problem, we again use an autocat-
alytic reaction loop of chemicals, but here we consider the
situation in which Di, ri or si is dependent on the chem-
ical species i (ri is the reaction constant of the reaction
Xi + Xi+1 → 2Xi+1). Note that for there to be a DIT
to a 1-3 or 2-4 rich state, it is necessary that the time
interval for inﬂow of molecules be longer than the time
scale of the reactions. This time interval for Xi inﬂow
should be ∼ 1/DisiV . In our previous study, in which
we considered the case of identical parameter values for
all i, the discreteness of the molecular concentration has
the same eﬀect for all the molecule species, and the tran-
sition occurs near DsV = r.

It is important to realize that the relevance of the
discreteness of the molecular concentration depends on
the reaction and ﬂow rates of each molecule when the
parameter values are not identical. For example,
if
D1s1 < D2s2, the inﬂow time interval for X1 molecules
is longer than that for X2 molecules, so that the discrete-
ness of the X1 ﬂow has a greater eﬀect on the behavior
of the system. In general, V may determine the species
that become extinct, and the average concentration of
each molecule can be greatly changed by the discreteness
eﬀect.

Here, we consider the case in which si is species depen-
dent, while D and r are identical for all species, for the
autocatalytic loop introduced above. With this choice,
the discreteness eﬀect of each chemical Xi depends on

i.
In this system, we ﬁnd discreteness eﬀects that re-
sult in changes of the average concentrations ¯xi, with the
temporal average of the concentration xi = Ni/V . Al-
though this result is obtained with this simple example,
the mechanism we ﬁnd would appear to be quite general,
and hence there is reason to believe that the DIT we ﬁnd
exists in a wide variety of real systems [6].

We ﬁrst consider the eﬀect of the discreteness of the
inﬂow of chemicals and how this depends on the relation
between the reaction rate and the inﬂow rate.
In our
model, the inﬂow interval of Xi is ∼ 1
DsiV , and the time
scale of the reaction is ∼ xi
. When the former time
rxixi+1
scale is larger than the latter, the reaction from i to i + 1
can proceed to completion before the inﬂow of species
i occurs. Then Ni becomes 0. As long as Ni = 0, no
reaction to produce chemical Xi occurs, and the average
density may be decreased radically from the continuum
limit case.

Case I : inﬂow discreteness and reaction rate
As a simplest example to study this mechanism, we
consider the case with s1 = s3 > s2 = s4. In this case,
the rate equation in the continuum limit has a stable ﬁxed
point ∀i : xi = si. When V is large, each xi ﬂuctuates
around this ﬁxed point. The average concentration ¯xi is
shown in Fig. 1a. With the decrease of V , the diﬀerence
between the pair ¯x1 and ¯x3 and the pair ¯x2 and ¯x4 is am-
pliﬁed, and there is clear deviation from the continuum
limit case.

The mechanism responsible for this ampliﬁcation can
be understood as follows. As V is decreased, we have
found that the 1-3 rich state, with extinction of N2
and N4, appears when the increase of ¯x1 and ¯x3 oc-
curs. To realize N2 = N4 = 0,
it is necessary for
the inﬂow interval of X2 or X4 to be longer than the
time scale of the reaction. The inﬂow interval of Xi
molecules is ∼ 1
DsiV , while the time scale for the re-
action is ∼ xi
. Since we set r = 1 and xi = O(1),
rxixi+1

the 1-3 rich state appears for
r , while the
1
2-4 rich state appears for
r . Thus in the
Ds1V ,
present case, the 1-3 rich state is ﬁrst observed as V is
decreased. In the range of values of V for which the re-
Ds4V are satisﬁed, the
lations
1-3 rich state is realized often, while the 2-4 rich state is
not.

Once the 1-3 rich state is realized, an X2 molecule and
an X4 molecule must enter the system almost simulta-
neously for the system to break out of this state. Thus
the ‘rate of interruption’ of the 1-3 rich state is roughly
proportional to s2s4V 2, the product of the rates of X2
inﬂow and X4 inﬂow. The expected residence time in the
1-3 rich state is the reciprocal of the rate of interruption.
Thus the ratio of the expected residence times in the 1-3
rich and 2-4 rich states is s1s3
s2s4

.

From the above considerations, we expect that for
, there appears a transition to the 1-3 rich

state, leading to a drastic increase of the 1-3 concentra-
tion. The validity of this conclusion has been conﬁrmed
by several simulations, one of whose results is shown in
Fig. 1a.

Case I′ : imbalance of inﬂow discreteness
The transition discussed above can create a stronger
eﬀect on the concentrations. As an example, consider
the case s1 = s3 > s2 > s4.

In this case, as in case I, the 1-3 rich state is stable.
While in this state, the system switches from a condition
of N1 > N3 to one of N1 < N3 due to X2 inﬂow and
from N1 < N3 to N1 > N3 due to X4 inﬂow. Since the
latter event is less frequent for s2 > s4, the condition
N1 < N3 is satisﬁed for a greater amount of time in the
1-3 rich state. Hence, it is expected that ¯x1 < ¯x3. This
is conﬁrmed by the results displayed in Fig. 1b. This
is in strong contrast with the result in the continuum
limit, where ¯x1 ≈ ¯x3 if D ≪ rsi (i.e., the time scale of
the reactions is much shorter than that of the inﬂow).
The signiﬁcant diﬀerence between ¯x1 and ¯x3 found here
appears only when the 1-3 rich state is realized through
the eﬀect of the discreteness of the ﬂow of X4 molecules.
As shown in Fig. 1b, there is ampliﬁcation of the dif-
ference between ¯x1 and ¯x3 as V decreases that occurs
simultaneously with the transition to the 1-3 rich state.

Case II : inﬂow and outﬂow
When DsiV is small enough to insure the existence of
both 1-3 and 2-4 rich states, the preference of states can
depend on the concentrations si. The preferred state is
selected through another DIT caused by outﬂow rather
than inﬂow of a particular chemical.

As an example, we consider the case s2 ≥ s1 > s3 = s4.
Here again, the rate equation in the continuum limit has
a stable ﬁxed point. If D ≪ rsi, then x1, x3 ≈ s1+s3
and
x2, x4 ≈ s2+s4

at the ﬁxed point.

As discussed above, 1-3 and 2-4 rich states appear for
small Ds3V . In the 2-4 rich state, it is likely for N4 to
decrease as a result of the outﬂow of X4 and the reaction
X4 + X1 → 2X1 facilitated by the inﬂow of X1.

If s4V < 1, it may be the case that all X4 molecules
ﬂow out, and N4 becomes 0. The time required to realize
N4 = 0 from N4 = n should be ∼ 1
D log n when s4V ≈ 0
and n ≫ 1. However, if s1 is large, X4 will be consumed
by the reaction caused by X1, and for this reason, N4
will decrease to 0 more rapidly. The time required to use
up X4 may also depend on s1. In this case, the 1-3 rich
state is favoured by the mechanism described below.

When N4 > 0, N4 can increase again as a result of X3
inﬂow, which leads to switch from the N2 > N4 condition
to the N2 < N4 condition. The inﬂow interval for X3 is
∼ 1
Ds3V . If this interval is much shorter than the time
required for N4 to reach 0, N4 may increase again, caus-
ing the 2-4 rich state to be preserved. However, if the
interval is longer, N4 may decrease to 0, in which case,
the 2-4 rich state can be readily destroyed by the inﬂow
of an X3 molecule, as shown in Fig. 2.

When the system is in the 1-3 rich state, on the other
hand, switches from a condition of N1 > N3 to one of
N1 < N3 due to X2 inﬂow, cause N3 to remain large (as
in case I′). The system therefore tends to maintain the
condition N1 < N3 (as long as D/rsi is not too large).
However, N1 only rarely decreases to 0, unlike N4, be-
cause s1 is relatively large. Thus the 1-3 rich state is
more stable than the 2-4 rich state.

1

Hence, when V is decreased suﬃciently to satisfy
s4V < 1, and the time interval
Ds3V is suﬃciently long to
allow N4 to decrease to 0, the 2-4 rich state loses stability,
and the residence time in the 1-3 rich state increases, due
to the discreteness of X4. As a consequence, ¯x3 increases
as V decreases, as shown in Fig. 1c.
Ampliﬁcation by Discreteness
Summarizing the ﬁndings discussed above, diﬀerences
among the ‘degrees of discreteness’ of the chemicals lead
to novel DIT. The average chemical concentrations are
greatly altered by this DIT. Indeed, as the system size
(the volume V ) changes, there is a sharp transition to a
state qualitatively diﬀerent from that found in the con-
tinuum limit. There are two key parameters with regard
DsiV (investigated in case I), the
to discreteness: One is
inﬂow time interval for Xi, and the other is siV (investi-
gated in case II), the number of species Xi molecules in
the system when it is at equilibrium with the reservoir.
With the conditions investigated in case I and II satis-
ﬁed for each species Xi, there appear several switches
to diﬀerent states as V is changed. As an example,
we considered the case in which s1 = 0.09, s2 = 3.89,
s3 = s4 = 0.01, and D = 1/64.
In this case, the av-
erage concentration ¯xi exhibits three transitions as V is
decreased, as shown in Fig. 3.

1

First, in the continuum limit, ¯x1 and ¯x3 are very small,
as results from the fact that s1 + s3 ≪ s2 + s4. Around
V = 103, the discreteness of X3 becomes signiﬁcant, and
the 2-4 rich state appears. While the system is in the 2-4
rich state, X2 > X4 is satisﬁed for most of the time, as
shown in case I′. Figure 4 displays the distribution of x2.

16. Here s1 = 0.09, s2 = 3.89, s3 = s4 = 0.01, and D = 1/64
(also the same for Figs. 3 and 4). There is a transition to the
2-4 rich state at t = 4511. In the 2-4 rich state, X4 molecules
ﬂow out at the rate D, and N4 thereby decreases. Due to the
ﬂow of X3 molecules, switching from N2 > N4 to N2 < N4
occurs, and N4 increases again (as seen at t = 4743). Here,
the interval over which the switching takes place is longer
than the interval of X3 inﬂow, 1/DV s3 = 400, and is indeed
long enough for most X4 molecules to diﬀuse out before X3
molecules can ﬂow into the system. Thus, here N4 readily
decreases to 0 before the switch. At t = 5300, with N4 = 0
an X3 molecule ﬂows into the container, leading to a switch
to the 1-3 rich state.

in this situation.

As seen in case II, The diﬀerence between N2 and N4
increases with further decrease of V , since the switching
rate decreases. Around V = 102, ﬁnally, the imbalance
between N2 and N4 destabilizes the 2-4 rich state. For
this reason, the 1-3 rich state becomes almost as stable
as (or more stable than) the 2-4 rich state, in spite of the
relation s1 + s3 ≪ s2 + s4. The residence time in the
1-3 rich state increases sharply, causing ¯x3 to increase

its value in the continuum limit.

For very small V (i.e. V < 2), N1 and N3 decrease to

point value of the continuum limit. As V decreases, there ﬁrst
appears a 2-4 rich state, but for smaller V , this 2-4 rich state
becomes unstable, and the residence time of the 1-3 rich state
increases, leading to a sharp increase of ¯x3. For much smaller
V (< 0.5), only X2 molecules exist for most of the time.

limit. Around V = 103, double peaks appear around x2 =
1 and x2 = 3, corresponding to the 2-4 rich state. As V
decreases, these two peaks move apart, and near V = 102,
the tail of the lower peak reaches 0, implying that N2 and N4
often decrease to 0. Thus here, the 2-4 rich state is unstable.
Then, as V is decreased further, the peak at x2 = 0 rises
sharply.

0 quite readily, and thus the 1-3 rich state also is easily
destroyed. Here, only ¯x2 has a large value, with all of the
others near or at Ni = 0.

In the manner described above, non-trivial alteration
of chemical concentrations as a result of DIT was ob-
served.
It has been found that those molecule species
whose numbers vanish are determined not only by the

4

ﬂow rates but also by the network and dynamics of
the reactions. For example, when V is relatively large
(V ≈ 102), ¯x3 decreases as s3 increases.

In conclusion, we have reported a DIT that leads to a
strong eﬀect on the average concentrations of the chem-
icals. Although we have studied a simple case with only
four chemicals here, we have found that this type of
DIT appears in more complex reaction networks of a
more general nature, in which the combination of the
two mechanisms we studied here leads to a variety of
transitions and alterations of molecular concentrations.
It is now experimentally feasible to construct a cat-
alytic reaction system in a micro-reactor, and to design
other types of systems with small numbers of molecules.
In such systems, experimental veriﬁcation of DIT should
be possible. Also, we believe that the alterations of chem-
ical concentrations resulting from DIT that we found will
have practical applications.

Since the number of molecules in a biological cell is
often small, the relevance of DIT to cell biology is ob-
vious. Indeed, according to our results, the non-trivial
accumulation of dilute molecules and switching among
several distinct states with diﬀerent chemical composi-
tions may be realizable by, for example, the control of
ﬂow by receptors.

Switching the expression of genes on and oﬀ is a focus
of interest in bioinformatics. This digital behavior is also
connected with the concentration of proteins present. As
we have seen, in our model one chemical species can ex-
hibit both an on/oﬀ switch and continuous regulation
of other chemicals, even if the number of molecules of
this species is small. We believe that the switching of
chemical states facilitated by our DIT plays a role in the
regulation of genetic and metabolic processes in cells.

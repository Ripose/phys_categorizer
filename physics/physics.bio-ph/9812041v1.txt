Abstract

The ratios of the codon usage in the quartets and sextets for the vertebrate series exhibit
a correlated behaviour which ﬁts naturally in the framework of the crystal basis model of
the genetic code [1]. Moreover the observed universal behaviour of these suitably normalized
ratios can be easily explained.

1 Introduction

It is a well known and intriguing fact that, in the genetic code, 64 codons code the biosynthesis
of 20 amino-acids (a.a.) with a structure in multiplets reported in Table 1.
It is also a well known and, at our knowledge, unexplained fact that the frequency rate of usage
(codon usage) of the diﬀerent codons inside a multiplet is not the same.
It is the aim of this paper to emphasize for the vertebrate series a correlation in the codon usage,
in the quartets and sextets, which is naturally explained in the framework of the mathematical
model of the genetic code recently proposed by the authors [1]. Moreover we put in evidence an
universal function behaviour connected with the codon usage, which also ﬁnds a justiﬁcation in
the model.
In Sec. 2 we recall the essential features of the model and in Sec. 3 we present the analysis of the
codon usage for a set of biological sequences in the vertebrate series [3].

2 The crystal basis model

2.1 The crystal basis

Let us brieﬂy recall some properties of the crystal basis [2]. We limit ourselves to the case of
Uq(sl(2)), but such basis exists for any ﬁnite dimensional representation of Uq→0(G) , G being any
(semi)-simple classical Lie algebra. The crystal basis has the nice property, for Uq(sl(2)), that in
the limit q → 0

and

for 0 ≤ k < 2J

for 0 < k ≤ 2J

J− uk = uk−1

J3 uk = (k − J) uk

for 0 ≤ k ≤ 2J

J+ u2J =

J− u0 = 0

J± are a redeﬁnition, using an element of the center, of the generators J± of
where the operators
e
Uq(sl(2)),
J3 = J3, and uk are the basis vectors of the irreducible representation labelled by J (J
e
being an integer or half-integer). The labels of the irreducible representation are connected to the
eigenvalues of the “Casimir” operator C:

Its eigenvalue on any vector basis of the irreducible J-representation is J(J + 1).
Moreover any state in the tensor product of two irreducible representations R1 ⊗ R2 is written in
the crystal basis as one and only one tensor product of a R1 state by a R2 state [2]. For example,
taking for R1 and R2 the two-dimensional representation J = 1
2 of Uq→0(sl(2)) with states |+i and
|−i, one will get in R1 ⊗ R2 the J = 1 representation displayed by |+, +i, |−, +i and |−, −i, and
the J = 0 representation with the state |+, −i.

Now let us state the main hypothesis of our model [1].

1

2.2 The assumptions

Assumption I - The four nucleotides containing the bases: adenine (A) and guanine (G), deriving
from purine, and cytosine (C) and thymine (T ), coming from pyrimidine, are the basis vectors of
a crystal basis of the (1/2, 1/2) irreducible representation of the quantum algebra Uq(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2))
in the limit q → 0.
In the following, we denote with ± the basis vector corresponding to the
eigenvalue ±1/2 of J 3
α, where α = H (V ) speciﬁes the generator of the ﬁrst (second) sl(2). We
assume the following “spin” structure (we remind that the thymine T in the DNA is replaced by
the uracile U in the RNA):

C ≡ (+, +)

sl(2)V l

G ≡ (+, −)

U ≡ (−, +)

l sl(2)V

A ≡ (−, −)

sl(2)H

←→

←→

sl(2)H

(6)

Let us remark that the H-symmetry is associated to the purine-pyrimidine structure, while the
V -symmetry reﬂects the complementarity rule (that is A − T /U and C − G interactions).

Assumption II - The codons are the basis vectors, in the crystal basis, of the irreducible represen-
tations build up by the tensor product of three 4-dimensional ( 1
2) fundamental representations
describing the nucleotides.
We have reported in Table 1 the assignment of the codons classiﬁed in the representations which
appear in the r.h.s. of the following relation:

2, 1

2, 1
( 1

2 ) ⊗ ( 1

2) ⊕ 2 ( 3

2, 1

2) ⊕ 2 ( 1

2, 3

2) ⊕ 4 ( 1

2, 1
2)

(7)

In [1], an operator (called the reading or ribosome operator ) R has been constructed out of
the algebra Uq→0(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)), which describes the multiplet structure of the the genetic code in
the following way: two codons have the same eigenvalue under R if and only if they are associated
to the same amino-acid. Moreover an “Hamiltonian” depending on 4 parameters has been build
up which gives a very satisfactory ﬁt of the 16 values of the free energy released in the folding of
a RNA sequence into a base paired double helix.

Let us close this section by drawing the reader’s attention to Fig. 1 where is speciﬁed for each
codon its position in the appropriate representation. The diagram of states for each representation
is supposed to lie in a separate parallel plane. Thick lines connect codons associated to the
same amino-acid. One remarks that each segment relates a couple of codons belonging to the
same representation or to two diﬀerent representations. This last case occurs for quadruplets or
sextets of codons associated to the same amino-acid. It is the purpose of this letter to show a
remarkable relation between such multiplets of codons (or amino-acids) involving the same subset
of representation and (branching ratios of) the probabilities of presence of codons in the amino-acid
biosynthesis.

2

3 Correlation of codon usage

We deﬁne the codon usage as the frequency of use of a given codon in the process of biosynthesis
of all the amino-acids. We deﬁne the probability of usage of the codon XY Z of a given amino-acid
as the ratio between the occurrence of the codon XY Z and the occurrence N of the corresponding
amino-acid, i.e. as the relative codon frequency, in the limit of very large N. Here and in the
following the labels X, Y, Z, V represent the bases C, U, G, A. The frequency rate of usage of a
codon in a multiplet is connected to its probability of usage P (XY Z → a.a.). It is reasonable
to assume that P (XY Z → a.a.) depends on: – the biological organism (b.o.) from which the
sequence considered has been extracted
– the sequence analyzed
– the nature of the neighboring codons in the sequence
– the amino-acid (a.a.)
– the nature and structure of the multiplet associated to the amino-acid
– the biological environment
– the properties of the codon itself (XY Z).

We neglect the time in which the biosynthesis process takes place as we assume that the
biosynthesis processes are considered at the same time, at least compared to the time scale of
evolution of the genetic code. We deﬁne the branching ratio BZV as

BZV =

P (XY Z → a.a.)
P (XY V → a.a.)

(8)

We argue that in the limit of very large number of codons, for a ﬁxed biological organism and
amino-acid, the branching ratio depends essentially on the properties of the codon. In our model
this means that in this limit BZV is a function, depending on the type of the multiplet, on the
quantum numbers of the codons XY Z and XY V , i.e. on the labels Jα, J 3
α , where α = H or V , and
on an other set of quantum labels leaving out the degeneracy on Jα; in Table 1 diﬀerent irreducible
representations with the same values of Jα are distinguished by an upper label. Moreover we
assume that BZV , in the limit above speciﬁed, depends only on the irreducible representation (IR)
of the codons, i.e.:

BZV = FZV (b.o.; IR(XY Z); IR(XY V ))

(9)

Let us point out that the branching ratio has a meaning only if the codons XY Z and XY U are
in the same multiplet, i.e. if they code the same amino-acid.
We consider the quartets and sextets. There are ﬁve quartets and three sextets in the eukariotic
code: that will allow a rather detailed analysis. Moreover the 3 sextets appear as the sum of a
quartet and a doublet, see Table 1. In the following we consider only the quartet sub-part of the
sextets. We recall that the 5 amino-acids coded by the quartets are:
[Pro, Ala, Thr, Gly ,Val]
[Leu, Arg, Ser]. There are, for the quartets,
and the 3 amino-acids coded by the sextets are:
6 branching ratios, of which only 3 are independent. We choose as fundamental ones the ratios
BAG, BCG and BU G. It happens that we can deﬁne several functions BZV , considering ratios of
probability of codons diﬀering for the ﬁrst two nucleotides XY , i.e.

BZV = FZV (b.o.; IR(XY Z); IR(XY V ))

3

(10)

(11)

B′

ZV = FZV (b.o.; IR(X ′Y ′Z); IR(X ′Y ′V ))

Then if the codon XY Z (XY V ) and X ′Y ′Z (X ′Y ′V ) are respectively in the same irreducible

representation, it follows that

BZV = B′

ZV

The analysis was performed on a set of data retrieved from the data bank of “Codon usage
tabulated from GenBank” [3].
In particular we analyzed two diﬀerent data set: the ﬁrst one
comprises all the data of at least 2 000 codons, while the second set represents all the data with
at least 30 000 codons. The referring organism for the analysis was Homo sapiens, whose codon
usage table derives from the analysis of more than 12 500 coding sequences, and corresponds to
about 6 000 000 codons.

Three quartets, coding the amino-acids Pro, Ala and Thr, have exactly the same content in
irreducible representations, see Table 1. In Table 2 we report the 16 biological organisms with
highest statistics. In Figs. 2, 3 and 4 the BAG , BU G and BCG are reported for the 8 amino-acids
coded by the quartets and sextets showing:

• a clear correlation between the four amino-acids Pro, Ala, Thr and Ser. From Table 1 we
see that for these amino-acids the irreducible representation involved in the numerator of
the branching ratios (see (8)) is always the same: (1/2, 1/2)1 for BAG, (1/2, 3/2)1 for BU G,
(3/2, 3/2) for BCG, while the irreducible representation in the denominator is (1/2, 1/2)1 for
the whole set. The relative position of each of these quartets of codons can be more easily
visualized in Fig. 1 where Pro, Ala, Thr and Ser (quartet part) constitute the four edges of
a vertical column linking the representation (1/2, 1/2)1, sitting at the ground ﬂoor, ﬁrst to
the representation (3/2, 1/2)1, then to the (1/2, 3/2)1 one and ﬁnally to the representation
(3/2, 3/2), this last one located at the top ﬂoor.

• a clear correlation between the two amino-acids Val and Leu. From Table 1 we see that
also for these two amino-acids the irreducible representation in the numerator of (8) is the
same: (1/2, 1/2)3 for BAG, (1/2, 3/2)2 for BU G, (1/2, 3/2)2 for BCG, and the irreducible
representation in the denominator is (1/2, 1/2)3. Considering Fig. 1, it is now the two
representations (1/2, 1/2)3 and (1/2, 3/2)2 which are brought together, the codons associated
to Val and Leu (quartet part) determining the vertices of two parallel and vertical plaquettes.

• no correlation of the Arg and also of the Gly with the others amino-acids, in agreement
with the irreducible representation assignment of Table 1. Indeed we can note in Fig. 1
that the representations (1/2, 1/2)2 and (3/2, 1/2)2 are connected by the codon quartet
relative to Arg and (but) only by this multiplet. We also remark the Gly quartet in the
representations (1/2, 3/2)1 and (3/2, 3/2): its position is completely diﬀerent from the above
discussed quartets which show up in these representations.

Then in Figs. 5, 6 and 7 we have drawn the normalized branching ratios

deﬁned by:

These diagrams show an universal behaviour of

BP G which has the same value independently
b
of the biological organism. We have omitted in the diagram the branching ratio of the amino-acid
Gly as it is dependent from the branching ratios of the other amino-acids due to our deﬁnition
eq. (12). In our model this behaviour can easily be understood if the branching ratio BZV has
the factorized form

BZV = ΦZV (b.o.) ψZV (IR(XY Z); IR(XY V ))

(13)

This factorization explains also the correlation in the behaviour between the values of BP G for
diﬀerent biological organisms, see Figs. 2, 3 and 4. Finally we report in the table below the mean
value and the standard deviation for the case of biological organisms with low statistics to put in
evidence the eﬀects of the statistics.

4 Conclusions

The basic elements of our model of the genetic code are the 4 nucleotides and the 64 codons come
out as composed states. The symmetry algebra Uq→0(sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)) has two main characteristics.
Firstly, it encodes the stereochemical property of a base confering quantum numbers to each
it admits representation spaces with the remarkable property that the
nucleotide. Secondly,
vector bases of the tensor product are ordered sequences of the basic elements (nucleotides). The
model does not necessarily assign the codons in a multiplet (in particular the quartets, sextets
and triplet) to the same irreducible representation. This feature is relevant. Indeed, as we have
shown in this paper, it may explain the correlation between the branching ratio of the codon
usage of diﬀerent codons coding the same amino-acid. Let us remark that the assignments of the
codons to the diﬀerent irreducible representations is a straightforward consequence of the tensor
product once assigned the nucleotides to the fundamental irreducible representation, see our ﬁrst
assumption.

It is a prevision of our model that for any biological organism belonging to the vertebrate
series, in the limit of large number of biosynthetized amino-acids, the ratios BAG, BU G and BCG
for, respectively, Pro, Ala, Thr and Ser (Val and Leu) should be very close. Let us remark that
obviously these ratios depend on the biological organism and we are unable to make any prevision
on their values, but only that their values should be correlated. Our analysis has also shown
an universal behaviour of the normalized branching ratio of the codon usage for the vertebrates,
which was not evidently expected in our model, but which can easily be explained assuming a
factorized form for the BZV . So, assuming the factorization (13), we foresee that the normalized
BCG should be given for any biological organism by the values reported in
BAG,

A ﬁrst analysis including biological organisms belonging to the invertebrate and plant series
show that the pattern of correlation is still present, even in a less striking way, but signiﬁcant
deviations appear for some biological organisms. A more detailed analysis with extension to the
other multiplets, in particular the doublets, and to other series of biological organisms will be
done in a further more detailed publication.

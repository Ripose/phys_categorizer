Experiments with myxobacterial aggregates reveal standing waves called rippling patterns. Here,
these structures are modelled with a simple discrete model based on the interplay between migration
and collisions of cells. Head-to-head collisions of cells result in cell reversals. To correctly reproduce
the rippling patterns, a refractory phase after each cell reversal has to be assumed, during which
further reversal is prohibited. The duration of this phase determines the wavelength and period of
the ripple patterns as well as the reversal frequency of single cells.

Pattern formation in aggregates of bacteria and amoe-
bae is a widely observed phenomenon [1,2]. Complex
colonial patterns of spots, stripes and rings are pro-
duced by E. coli [3]. Bacillus subtilis exhibits branch-
ing patterns during colonial growth [4]. Two- and three-
dimensional circular waves and spirals have been ob-
served during aggregation of the eukaryotic slime mold
Dictyostelium discoideum [5-8], often closely resembling
patterns in chemical reactions [9].
These patterns
are typically modelled with continuous reaction-diﬀusion
equations describing the spatiotemporal evolution of the
cell density and concentrations of chemoattractants and
nutrients, e. g. in the cases of Dictyostelium discoideum
[1,10,11] and E. coli [12,13]. An alternative approach
uses discrete models describing the motion of individual
cells and has been previously employed to study swarm
behavior [14-16].

The prokaryotic soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus
[17,18] is one of the most intriguing examples for mor-
phogenesis and pattern formation. Like the slime mold
Dictyostelium discoideum, M. xanthus exhibits social be-
haviour and a complex developmental cycle. As long as
there is suﬃcient food supply, vegetative cells feed on
other bacterial species, grow and divide. But when nu-
trients run short, bacteria start to aggregate and ﬁnally
build a multicellular structure, the fruiting body. In or-
der to maintain this life cycle intercellular communication
is essential. Although a phospholipid chemoattractant
has been identiﬁed [19] recently, the key role is ascribed
to interactions occuring through cell-cell contact during
collisions [17].

An experimental example for the rippling phenomenon
[20,21] is displayed in Fig. 1. Bacteria organize into
equally spaced ridges (dark regions) that are separated by
regions with low cell density (light regions); for a movie

see [22]. Rippling patterns were ﬁrst discovered by one
of us (H. Reichenbach) and originally named oscillatory
waves. We examine the temporal dynamics of the density
proﬁle along a one-dimensional cut indicated by the white
line in Fig. 1a. The resulting space-time plot is shown
in Fig. 1b and reveals a periodically oscillating standing
wave pattern superimposed by spatiotemporal noise.

In the following, we present a model based on the dy-
namics of individual cells for the formation of ripple pat-
terns during the aggregation of myxobacteria. We will
show how certain collision rules between cells on the “mi-
croscopic” level lead to the observed macroscopic pattern
and reproduce the characteristics of single cell behaviour.
The basic rules of the model are derived from experi-
mental results by Sager and Kaiser [23]: Within the rip-

neighborhood is a ﬁve nodes cross in the y, z-plane at that
x-position the cell is directed to (here the cell orientation is
the +x-direction).

pling phase cells are found to move on linear paths par-
allel to each other about a distance of one wavelength.
When two opposite moving cells collide head-on, they re-
verse their gliding direction due to exchange of a small,
membrane-associated protein called C-factor. Further-
more, the model assumes a refractory phase in which
cells can not respond to the signal. This additional in-
gredient is necessary for the formation of the rippling
pattern from a random conﬁguration. The characteristic
wavelength and period is determined by the duration τ of
the refractory phase. τ is the only adjustable parameter;
the experimental data are reproduced with a refractory
period of ﬁve minutes.

In the rippling phase, cells are densely packed and elon-
gated parallel to each other. The organisation of cells into
the aligned state can be modeled using particle-based
models [15,16]. Our model is deﬁned on a ﬁxed square
grid in the x − y-plane and assumes discrete space co-
ordinates, analagous to cellular automaton models. The
number of cells in the model is conserved and character-
ized by the average number ¯n of cells per lattice site;
cell death and replication of cells are neglected. The
discrete z−discrete coordinate describes the number of
cells piled up on top of each other in a given lattice
point in the x − y-plane. The temporal update is done
in discrete time steps. Cells mainly move along linear
paths in the x-direction. Thus, even a two-dimensional
model is a reasonable ﬁrst step. Nevertheless, we also
study the three-dimensional case because of its exper-
imental relevance. The movement of individual bacte-
ria is restricted to sheets with ﬁxed y-coordinate. The
coupling in the y-direction is solely due to interaction.
A single cell is thus described by a three-dimensional
space coordinate (x, y, z) and an orientation variable
φ ∈ {−1(left), 1(right)} referring to the gliding direc-
tion. Cells interact only via head-on collisions, i. e. cells
only sense counterpropagating cells in a certain interac-
tion neighborhood.

The sensitivity of a bacterium to C-factor is described
by a clock variable ν. When a sensitive cell collides head-
on with other cells, (the meaning of collisions will be
speciﬁed below), it reverses its gliding direction and is
refractory for the next τ − 1 time steps. ν measures the
time since the last reversal, thus a cell with ν < τ is

insensitive to C-factor. Overhangs and holes in the bulk
are prohibited. A bacterial cell is assumed to cover one
node of the lattice, this determines the lattice constants
of 10 µm in x- and 1 µm in y- and z−directions and the
time constant of 1 min.

The temporal update of the model consists of a migra-
tion and an interaction step.
In the asynchronous mi-
gration step cells move according to their orientation to
the neighboring site in x-direction. If this site is already
occupied, the cell pushes its way between cells of the
adjacent column increasing its height by 1. With equal
probability the cell slips beneath or above the blocking
cell. This random process causes internal noise. There is
also a diﬀusion-like noise contribution, because cells are
assumed to rest with small probability p (in the simula-
tions below p = 0.05 is used). Interaction takes place si-
multaneously; every sensitive cell (ν ≥ τ ) checks a neigh-
borhood of ﬁve nodes depending on its orientation φ (Fig.
2b). If a cell encounters at least one cell with opposite
orientation in this neighborhood (collision), the cell re-
verses orientation (φ → −φ) and will be refractory for
τ time steps. The cell is insensitive to neighbors but
it can still cause the reversal of other cells. Random ini-
tial conditions and periodic boundary conditions are used
throughout.

The model described in the previous section repro-
duces the experimentally observed ripple patterns, see
Fig. 3. The rippling pattern and the temporal evolution
obtained in the model (Fig. 3) are in good agreement
with the experimental data of Fig. 1. Waves propagate

equally in both directions, their superposition forms a
standing wave. The wavelength of the ripple pattern in-
creases with the duration τ of the refractory phase. The
discrete model enables us to track the single cell behav-
ior. Typically, cells move over a distance of about half a
wavelength before they reverse their orientation (see Fig.
4c). The pattern is easily recognizable - wavelength and
period of the ripples have been reproduced in several in-
depedent runs and depend only weakly on the number of
cells in the aggregate (variations of the average number ¯n
of cells per lattice point between 2 and 10 do not produce
signiﬁcant changes, results presented here are for ¯n = 3).
Movies of the simulated rippling patterns can be found
in [22].

More insight is obtained by deriving a mean-ﬁeld the-
ory of the discrete model in 2d. Such a description uses
a hierarchy of rate equations in discrete time and space,
which replace the discrete state variables by their aver-
age numbers. The mean-ﬁeld scheme [24] leads to the
following set of 2τ equations:

r1(x, t + 1) = r1(x − 1, t) − fr(x − 1, t) + rτ (x − 1, t)
r2(x, t + 1) = fl(x − 1, t)

r3(x, t + 1) = r2(x − 1, t)
...
rτ (x, t + 1) = rτ −1(x − 1, t)

l1(x, t + 1) = l1(x + 1, t) − fl(x + 1, t) + lτ −1(x + 1, t)
l2(x, t + 1) = fr(x + 1, t)

l3(x, t + 1) = l2(x + 1, t)
...
lτ (x, t + 1) = lτ −1(x + 1, t),

(1)

where r1 resp. l1 are right- resp. left moving cells that
can reserve, while r2, ..., rτ resp.
l2, ..., lτ denote right-
resp. left moving cells in the various stages of the refrac-
tory phase. The functions fr and fl describe the average
numbers of reversals of right- resp.
left moving cells.
The actual form of the reversal function is quite compli-
cated. Since the number of particles on one site is still
rather small, it is not suﬃcient to use their mean values
in the reversal function as would be the standard ap-
proach for rate equations describing chemical reactions.
Instead, one has to specify the distribution of the quanti-
ties l1, r1 around their mean values and sum over all pos-
sible states. We have used a Poissonian distribution for
this purpose and performed a linear stability analysis of
the homogeneous stationary state r1(x, t) = l1(x, t) = ρS
and ri(x, t) = li(x, t) = ρR for i = 2, ...., τ . This state
describes a ﬂat layer of cells with equal amounts of left-
and right-moving bacteria. The actual values of ρS and
ρR depend on the parameter τ and ¯n and should obey
ρR = fr(x, t) = fl(x, t) and ¯n = 2(ρS + (τ − 1)ρR). For
τ = 5 and ¯n = 3, we ﬁnd, for example, ρS ≈ 0.635

and ρR ≈ 0.216. A detailed derivation of the mean ﬁeld
theory will be published elsewhere [24].

The linear stability analysis of the rate equations (1)
with ¯n = 3, reveals a linear instability of this ﬂat
layer state against an oscillatory instability with ﬁnite
wavenumber for τ ≥ 4 min [24]. Moreover, we obtain the
wavenumber k with the fastest growth rate for τ ≥ 4 min
resp. weakest damping for τ < 4 min and the associated
frequency ω as a function of the refractory time τ . A com-
parison of the corresponding wavenumber λ = 2π/k and
period T = 2π/ω with equivalent quantities extracted
from a Fourier analysis of simulation data of the discrete
model shows good agreement below and near the thresh-
old τ ≤ 4 min, see Figs. 4a,b. Above the threshold
nonlinear eﬀects lead to a deviation of the predictions
from linear stability analysis. It is remarkable that the
mode with weakest damping can be observed directly for
τ ≤ 3 min. It indicates, that the intrinsic noise of the
discrete model drives the system out of the linear stable
regime and excites the modes with weakest damping.

The wavelength of the pattern in the experiment is
about 180 µm corresponding to 18 cell lengths. The tem-
poral period in the experiment is found to be around 10
min. Thus, a refractory time τ ≈ 5 min in the model
yields the correct experimental values for the wavelength
as well as for the period. As a third quantity, we can
measure the average reversal frequency of the individual
cells in the simulations taking advantage of the discrete,
particle-based nature of our model. A typical trajectory
of an individual cell in the model is displayed in Fig. 4c.
Most of the time the cells in the model ride with the
ripple crest and get reﬂected when two crests collide. In
other words, while the crest form is seemingly unchanged,
most of the cells that originally constituted the crest are
now part of a crest propagating in the other direction.
Occasionally a cell ,,tunnels” through and continues a
longer way with the same crest. For the refractory time
τ = 5 min, the reversal frequency for a single cell in the
model is about 0.15 reversals per cell and minute in the
three-dimensional model and 0.1 reversals per cell and
minute in two dimensions (see Fig. 4d) which is in the
range of the experimentally observed frequency of 0.081
reversals per cell and minute [23].

While previous experiments have not provided direct
information about the duration of a refractory phase, re-
cent measurements of reversal rates of myxobacteria ex-
posed to high concentration of isolated C-factor may give
a ﬁrst clue. Sager and Kaiser report an increase of the
reversal rate by a factor of 3 compared to normal aggre-
gates and an absolute reversal rate of roughly 0.3 rever-
sals per cell per minute [23]. This suggests a refractory
phase between 3 and 4 minutes. The reversal rates from
the model with a refractory phase of 5 minutes would
increase by a factor of 1.8 for the two-dimensional and
by a factor of 1.2 for the three-dimensional model. This
small discrepancy between model and experiment may
indicate that the refractory time depends on the amount

We presented a model for the formation of ripple pat-
terns during the aggregation of myxobacteria. The re-
versal mechanism of cells following collisions has to be
supplemented by a refractory phase, that speciﬁes a min-
imum time between subsequent reversals. The duration
of this phase determines the wavelength and the period of
the ripple pattern. The ,,microscopic” single cell behav-
ior agrees well with the experiments on the reversal fre-
quency of cells. Our study strongly suggests experiments
with single cells to verify the refractory hypothesis and to
elucidate its biochemical basis. Moreover, myxobacterial
rippling provides the ﬁrst example of a new mechanism
for pattern formation, namely one mediated by migration
and direct cell-cell interaction, that may be involved in
selforganization processes in other multicellular systems.

We present a novel electromagnetic model of DNA molecules, in which the P-bonds act as tunnel
junctions and the H-bonds as capacitors. Excess charge in the model gives rise to two coupled mod-
iﬁed sine-Gordon equations, which admit topological solitonic excitations. We study the dynamics
of the solitons, their eﬀect on the DNA transport properties, and comment about their role in the
DNA functioning. We propose speciﬁc experiments in order to test our predictions.

The DNA molecule is central to every living organ-
It carries the genetic code of the organism, and
ism.
continuously controls the synthesis of proteins, which are
vital to its functioning and existence. Since the pioneer-
ing discoveries of Watson and Crick, a considerable ef-
fort was devoted to the study of the DNA, and much
has been understood about its structure and activity [1].
Yet there are some key features which pose open ques-
tions. One such feature is the long range correlation and
control between segments of the DNA. Synthesis of pro-
teins is done via local ”reading” of speciﬁc sectors in
the DNA. The initiation of the reading is done by an-
other segment, which can be located far away along the
DNA sequence (thousands of bases away). Consider this
and other examples [2], it seems as if the DNA molecule
has the capability of transmitting information over long
distances and in a speciﬁc manner (the information is
transmitted to/from speciﬁc targets). Possible eﬃcient
candidates for such a transmission are solitons and soli-
tary waves (rather than point particles/wave packets and
linear waves). The existence and propagation of confor-
mational solitons related to the DNA replication process
have been studied in the past [3]. Non-topological charge
solitons in proteins have also been studied [4]. Motivated
by our studies of topological charge solitons in one dimen-
sional (1D) arrays of mesoscopic tunnel junctions [5], [6],
we have investigated the possibility of the existence of
topological charge solitons in DNA.

We have developed a novel electromagnetical model of
the DNA molecule, which is based on the properties of
charge dynamics in the DNA (see Fig. 1). We view each
of the DNA strands as a 1D array. A unit (or ’grain’)
of the array is a sugar and a base attached to it. The
grains are connected longitudinally by Phosphate groups
(P-bonds), and parallely, i.e., to the other strand, by the
Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between bases. An additional
electron residing on an atom belonging to the sugar-base
grain can hop from atom to atom, thus obtaining a ki-
netic energy. The H- and P-bonds form barriers to the
charge propagation. The proton in the H-bond can ef-
fectively screen a net charge density on either side of the
bond by shifting its position towards this side. (By ’net’

charge we mean the change from the charge distribution
of the unperturbed DNA.) As a result, electrons do not
cross the H-bond. Hence the bond can be viewed as a
capacitor. The P-bond barrier stems from the two oxy-
gens which are transversely connected to the phosphorus.
These oxygens share three electrons with the phosphorus,
giving rise to two σ bonds and one π bond. As the π elec-
tron can be shared with both oxygens, it behaves as an
electron in a double well, and occupies the lowest level.
When another electron approaches the well it encounters
a barrier due to the energy diﬀerence to the next level
of the well. However, since this barrier is narrow, the
approaching electron can tunnel through the well. Thus
from the charge dynamics point of view, the P-bond be-
haves as a tunnel junction.

We start with the model for a single strand (see Fig. 1).
For simplicity we assume that all the bases are of the
same type. Each grain i is composed of four sub-grains
(j = 0, 1, 2, 3), assigned with phase variables, φi,j . These
phases are related to the electric potential of the sub-
t
−∞ Vi,j (t′)dt′. The conjugate
grains through φi,j(t)
variable to each φi,j is the charge on the sub-grain, Qi,j.

It includes three types of energies:
inductive energies
which represent the hopping of electrons, capacitive en-
ergies which represent the capacitive properties of the H-
and P-bonds, and a tunneling energy, which represents
the tunneling process in the P-bond. This latter energy
is proportional to the cosine of the phase diﬀerence across
the bond, according to the tight binding picture [7]. The
values of the parameters can be obtained, in principle,
from experiments, but for now we employ only a quali-
tative view. The L0/2 inductance denotes the hopping
from the open side of a base to its sugar, while the L/2

1

inductance denotes the hopping between P-bonds. Since
the former involves more hopping around carbon rings,
we assume that L0 > L. Both CS and C0 denote in this
single-strand model capacitances to the outside world.
CS is the capacitance seen from the sugar, while C0 is
the capacitance seen from the open H-bond. We assume
that both are of the same order of magnitude and much
smaller than C, the capacitance of the P-bond tunnel
junction. EJ is the tunneling strength of the P-bond.
The length scale in our model, a, is the distance between
grains, which is 3.4˚A. (In the model we use units in which
a = 1.)

From the kinetic part of (1) we see that out of the four
variables describing the i’th grain only three are inde-
pendent. According to our experience in the study of 1D
arrays of tunnel junctions [6], we introduce non-local (or
integral) charge variables. These variables are very use-
ful in trying to probe the collective, non-local dynamics
of the DNA. We envision a propagation of charge from
a certain point in the far left of the chain (’
’) to a
certain point in the far right (’
’), passing on its way the
i’th grain. Referring to the i’th junction as the junction
between the i’th and the (i + 1)’th grains, we deﬁne Ri
as the charge that has passed through this junction:

Next we introduce the double-strand model (see again
Fig. 1). We distinguish between the two strands by the
superscripts α, β. The capacitance C0 describes now the
capacitive coupling between the two strands, i.e., over
the H-bonds. We assume that it is much larger than the
capacitance to the outside world, CS, but still smaller
than C. We take the parameters of the two strands to

2πn everywhere. We are thus left with a single equa-

This equation is equivalent to the one of the single-strand
model, but now q represents a soliton anti-soliton pair
(with zero total charge) rather than a single charged soli-
ton.

Equations (8,9) have two simple topological solutions.
One is the ”symmetrical” solution, namely, q = 0 and ¯q
is a usual Sine-Gordon kink. This solution is unstable ,at
least at low energy, since it corresponds to two charges
with equal sign which tend to separate. It is, however,
possible that it becomes stable at high energy, as was
demonstrated for the stacked Josephson junctions model
[10]. The other ”anti-symmetrical” solution has ¯q = 0
and q in the form of a kink. It is a stable solution which
correspond to an electron-hole pair (each on a diﬀerent
strand). It is plausible that this excitation is used in the
DNA to transmit information over long distances. It can
be created at a speciﬁc segment, which is responsible for
the initiation of a certain protein synthesis, by tunneling
of an electron through the H-bond (as a result of exter-
nal agent). The pair can, then, propagate almost freely
along the DNA, and be annihilated at the protein synthe-
sis segment by a reverse tunneling, thus transmitting the
order for this synthesis. The targeting of a speciﬁc an-
nihilation segment is probably done through the speciﬁc
base sequence of both segments, which was neglected in
our model.

the single-strand model (details will be given elsewhere
[8]), we obtain two (dimensionless) coupled modiﬁed sine-
Gordon equations of motion:

Similar equations, without the ζ term, where studied in
the past in connection with the stacked Josephson junc-
tions model [9].

We turn now to study the modiﬁed sine-Gordon equa-
tions we have derived, starting from the single-strand
model. The pure Sine-Gordon equation has exact topo-
logical solitons solutions. We have checked numerically
and found that the extra term in equation (7) does not
eﬀect the stability of the topological soliton solution,
though it does induce interaction with the plasmons.
This interaction causes the soliton to slowly radiate away
its kinetic energy. Using the collective coordinate:

X =

1
2π Z

−

qxx dx,

(11)

we ﬁnd that the soliton velocity actually oscillates with
relatively high frequency, but its average is almost con-
stant, decreasing only slightly over large period of time.
Therefore, though the soliton’s motion is not persistent
in the exact sense, charge can propagate relatively large
distances along the strand without the need to apply a
driving force in the form of a potential diﬀerence.

The extra term in equation (7) destroys the Lorenz
invariance of this equation. The dispersion relation for
small amplitude linear waves is

ω2 =

k2/(1 + µS) + 1
ζ
2 k2/(1 + µS) + 1

,

(12)

and the group velocity tend to zero for both small and
large k values. When the soliton velocity exceed the max-
imal group velocity, it leaves in its wake all the small
amplitude waves.

In the double-strand model, the dimensionless param-
eter µ serves as a measure of the strength of the interac-
tion between the strands (it is small for strong interac-
C0, µ is very small. In the extreme
tion). Since CS
µ = 0 limit, ¯qx should be zero as well, in order that the
Lagrangian for this model would be ﬁnite. As both qα
and qβ have integer values at the two edges of the chain,

The steepest curve is q(x), and the other is ¯q(x). Numerical
results are indicated by continues lines and the theoretical
curves of equation (14), by dashed lines.

There is also a way to approximate a solution which
corresponds to an electron (hole) moving with velocity v

¯c = 1/√2µ, are the linear wave velocities in equations
(8,9) (when the last term in equation (9) is neglected).
They correspond to the diﬀerent linear waves velocity in
the two equations. The exact solution can be obtained
numerically and is shown in Fig. 2.

V /VD and α

An important way to test our model is via measure-
ments of the current-voltage characteristics. An electron
can be injected to one of the strands to form a topolog-
ical charge soliton, and may be subjected to an applied
external voltage V and an Ohmic dissipation R (both per
unit length). We implement this in our model by adding
the terms F + α ˙¯q to equation (8) and α ˙¯q to equation
RC/√LC, are the exter-
(9), where F
nal force and the dissipation rate respectively. For given
values of force and dissipation rate a soliton reaches a
limiting velocity which corresponds to the measured cur-
rent. The I-V curves which we obtain for diﬀerent choices
of the µ and ζ parameters are shown in Fig. 3. It should
be noted that above some threshold voltage close to the
maximum voltage indicated in each curve of Fig. 3, the
system becomes unstable, as more and more soliton anti-
soliton pairs are created.

We turn now to discuss some possible experimental
tests of our predictions. The most straightforward test
is to measure the I-V characteristics of a DNA that was
mentioned earlier. Such experiments are now being de-
veloped [12]. We propose to use ﬁrst a single strand vs
a double strand.
It is easier to inject solitons into the
former. In the case of a double strand, it would be useful
if each end is made of a short single strand (a diﬀer-
ent one on each end). In both cases it would be easier
to compare the experimental results with the theoretical
predictions if artiﬁcial strands composed of repetitia of
one base are used. Another approach would be to study
the magnetic response of circular strands. The idea is to
place many circular strands on a surface, apply a time-
dependent magnetic ﬂux (say, of a saw tooth form), and
measure the response of the system. For short circular
strands at low temperature we expect to observe persis-
tent current carried by the charge solitons. Finally, a less
trivial experiment, is to inject a charge soliton at the end
of the DNA via Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM),
and look for a response at the other end (for example,
via an attached molecule that has a ﬂuorescent response
to an incoming charge).

These are just three examples of many more possible
tests of our predictions about the existence of topolog-
ical charge solitons in DNA molecules. If turned to be
veriﬁed, we expect charge solitons to have crucial role in
the DNA activities as means of transfer of information
and energy over long distances, and to speciﬁc locations.
To study this role, one can use our model as a start-
ing point, incorporating into it the inhomogeneity of the
chain due to the diﬀerent bases, as well as interactions
with external molecules at speciﬁc sites.

We are most thankful to E. Braun for sharing with
us his ideas about experimental measurements of DNA
electrical transport. This research is supported in part
by a GIF grant.

FIG. 3. The numerical current (velocity) - voltage (force)
curves for a charge soliton propagating in one strand. In the
lower curves α = 0.5 and µ = 0.5, while in the upper ones
α = 0.5 and µ = 0.05. In the continuous lines ζ = 0.1, and in
the short dash lines ζ = 1. The theoretical curve of equation
(15) is indicated by a long dash line.

We proceed to estimate the limiting velocity. To do
so, we equate the energy gain by the external force and
the dissipative energy [11]. We ﬁnd that ˙X(γ/c + ¯γ/¯c) =
πF/2α. This reduces in the small µ limit to

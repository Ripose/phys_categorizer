Abstract

The thalamus is the major gate to the cortex and its contribu-
tion to cortical receptive ﬁeld properties is well established. Cortical
feedback to the thalamus is, in turn, the anatomically dominant input
to relay cells, yet its inﬂuence on thalamic processing has been diﬃ-
cult to interpret. For an understanding of complex sensory processing,
detailed concepts of the corticothalamic interplay need yet to be es-
tablished. To study corticogeniculate processing in a model, we draw
on various physiological and anatomical data concerning the intrinsic
dynamics of geniculate relay neurons, the cortical inﬂuence on relay
modes, lagged and nonlagged neurons, and the structure of visual cor-
tical receptive ﬁelds. In extensive computer simulations we elaborate
the novel hypothesis that the visual cortex controls via feedback the
temporal response properties of geniculate relay cells in a way that
alters the tuning of cortical cells for speed.

Introduction

The thalamus is the major gate to the cortex for peripheral sensory sig-
nals, for input from various subcortical sources, and for reentrant cortical
information. Thalamic nuclei, however, do not merely relay information
to the cortex but perform some operation on it while being modulated by
various transmitter systems (McCormick, 1992) and in continuous interplay
with their cortical target areas (Guillery, 1995; Sherman, 1996; Sherman &

Guillery, 1996). Indeed, cortical feedback to the thalamus is the anatom-
ically dominant input to relay cells even in those thalamic nuclei that are
directly driven by peripheral sensory systems. While it is well established
that the receptive ﬁelds of cortical neurons are strongly inﬂuenced by con-
vergent thalamic inputs of diﬀerent types (Saul & Humphrey, 1992a; Saul
& Humphrey, 1992b; Reid & Alonso, 1995; Alonso et al., 1996; Ferster
et al., 1996; Jagadeesh et al., 1997; Murthy et al., 1998; Hirsch et al.,
1998), the modulation eﬀected by cortical feedback in thalamic response
has been diﬃcult to interpret. Experiments and theoretical considerations
have pointed to a variety of operations of the visual cortex on the lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN), such as attention-related gating of geniculate re-
lay cells (GRCs) (Sherman & Koch, 1986), gain control of GRCs (Koch,
1987), synchronizing ﬁring of neighboring GRCs (Sillito et al., 1994; Singer,
1994), increasing mutual information between GRCs’ retinal input and their
output (McClurkin et al., 1994), and switching GRCs from a detection to an
analyzing mode (Godwin et al., 1996; Sherman, 1996; Sherman & Guillery,
1996). Nonetheless, the evidence for any particular function to date is still
sparse and rather indirect.

Clearly, detailed concepts of the interdependency of thalamic and corti-
cal operation could greatly advance our ideas about complex sensory, and
ultimately cognitive, processing. Here we present a novel view on the cor-
ticothalamic puzzle by proposing that control of velocity tuning of visual
cortical neurons may be an eminent function of corticogeniculate process-
ing. We have outlined some of the ideas in Hillenbrand & van Hemmen
(2000) previously.

In this section we will review facts, some well established, others still
controversial, on the thalamocortical system in order to clear the ground for
the following simulation of the primary visual pathway.

1.1 Geniculate Response Timing and Cortical Velocity

Tuning

Velocity selectivity or velocity tuning, taken here to mean preference for a
certain speed and direction of motion of visual features, requires conver-
gence of pathways with diﬀerent spatial information and diﬀerent temporal
characteristics, such as delays, onto single neurons; see, e.g., Hassenstein &
Reichardt (1956), Watson & Ahumada (1985), Emerson (1997). For higher
mammals this is believed to occur in the primary visual cortex (Movshon,
1975; Orban et al., 1981b; Orban et al., 1981a).

In the A-laminae of cat LGN two types of X-relay cell have been iden-
tiﬁed that dramatically diﬀer in their temporal response properties (Mas-
tronarde, 1987a; Humphrey & Weller, 1988a; Saul & Humphrey, 1990).
Those that are more delayed in response time and phase have been termed
lagged, the others nonlagged cells (with the exception of very few so-called

2

partially lagged neurons); see Figure 1. In lagged neurons, the on-response
to a ﬂash of light is preceded by a dip in the ﬁring rate lasting for 5 to 220
ms and there is typically a transient of high ﬁring rate just after the oﬀset
of a prolonged light stimulus (Mastronarde, 1987a; Humphrey & Weller,
1988a). For a moving light bar, the time lag of the on-response peak is
about 100 ms after the bar has passed the receptive ﬁeld (RF) center (Mas-
tronarde, 1987a). In contrast, the nonlagged cells’ responses resemble their
retinal input and show no transient at stimulus oﬀset (Mastronarde, 1987a;
Humphrey & Weller, 1988a). Lagged X-cells comprise about 40 % of all X-
relay cells (Mastronarde, 1987a; Humphrey & Weller, 1988b). Physiological
(Mastronarde, 1987b), pharmacological (Heggelund & Hartveit, 1990), and
structural (Humphrey & Weller, 1988b) evidence suggests that rapid feed-
forward inhibition via intrageniculate interneurons plays a decisive role in
shaping the lagged cells’ response. Some authors have additionally related
diﬀerences in receptor types to the lagged-nonlagged dichotomy (Heggelund
& Hartveit, 1990; Hartveit & Heggelund, 1990); see, however, Kwon et al.
(1991).

Layer 4B in cortical area 17 of the cat is the target of both lagged and
nonlagged geniculate X-cells (Saul & Humphrey, 1992a; Jagadeesh et al.,
1997; Murthy et al., 1998). The spatiotemporal RFs of its direction-selective
simple cells can routinely be interpreted as being composed of subregions
that receive geniculate inputs alternating between lagged and nonlagged
X-type (Saul & Humphrey, 1992a; Saul & Humphrey, 1992b; DeAngelis
et al., 1995; Jagadeesh et al., 1997; Murthy et al., 1998), just as convergent
and segregated geniculate on- and oﬀ-inputs have been shown to outline
the spatial structure of the simple cells’ RFs (Reid & Alonso, 1995; Alonso
et al., 1996; Ferster et al., 1996; Hirsch et al., 1998). According to this view,
directional selectivity is created by the response-phase diﬀerence of roughly
a quarter cycle between successive oﬀ-lagged, oﬀ-nonlagged, on-lagged, and
on-nonlagged responses across the RF. At least for simple cells in layer
4B, this RF structure determines the response to moving visual features
(McLean & Palmer, 1989; McLean et al., 1994; Reid et al., 1991; Albrecht
& Geisler, 1991; DeAngelis et al., 1993; DeAngelis et al., 1995; Jagadeesh
et al., 1993; Jagadeesh et al., 1997; Murthy et al., 1998), and hence the cell’s
tuning for direction and speed1. Lagged and nonlagged inputs that converge,
either directly or via other cortical neurons, on simple cells and segregate
in separate subregions of the simple cells’ RF are thus likely to contribute
to the earliest level of cortical velocity selectivity (Saul & Humphrey, 1990;
Saul & Humphrey, 1992a; Saul & Humphrey, 1992b; Ferster et al., 1996;

1To avoid confusion, we point out that the term ‘speed tuning’ is sometimes used in a
more restricted sense. Simple cells exhibit tuning for spatial and temporal frequencies that
results in preference for speeds of moving gratings depending on their spatial frequency.
Here we will be concerned with the more natural case of stimuli having a low-pass frequency
content (Field, 1994), speciﬁcally, those composed of local features such as thin bars.

Murthy et al., 1998).

Certainly, intracortical input to cortical cells also contributes to velocity-
selective responses, given that these inputs anatomically outnumber thala-
mic inputs (Ahmed et al., 1994). Suggested intracortical eﬀects include
sharpening of tuning properties by suppressive interactions (Hammond &
Pomfrett, 1990; Reid et al., 1991; Hirsch et al., 1998; Crook et al., 1998;
Murthy & Humphrey, 1999), ampliﬁcation of geniculate inputs by recur-
rent excitation (Douglas et al., 1995; Suarez et al., 1995), and normalization
of responses by local interactions (Toth et al., 1997). Intracortical circuits
can in principle even generate their own direction selectivity by selectively

4

inhibiting responses to nonpreferred motion (Douglas et al., 1995; Suarez
et al., 1995; Maex & Orban, 1996). Our modeling is complementary to the
latter in that we emphasize the inﬂuence of geniculate inputs on cortical RF
properties that is suggested by numerous studies (Saul & Humphrey, 1992a;
Saul & Humphrey, 1992b; Reid & Alonso, 1995; Alonso et al., 1996; Ferster
et al., 1996; Toth et al., 1997; Jagadeesh et al., 1997; Murthy et al., 1998;
Hirsch et al., 1998), in order to bring out eﬀects that are speciﬁc to the
geniculate contribution to spatiotemporal tuning.

Great care must be taken when extrapolating from cats to primates. In
particular, no lagged relay cells have been described in the primate LGN
so far. On the other hand, a recent study (Valois & Cottaris, 1998) does
suggest a set of geniculate inputs to directionally selective simple cells in
macaque striate cortex that is essentially analogous, in terms of response
properties, to the lagged-nonlagged set envisaged for cat simple cells. If the
underlying physiology for primates turns out to be similar to the one for
cats, the results presented here extend to primates.

1.2 Geniculate Relay Modes

Thalamocortical neurons possess a characteristic blend of voltage-gated ion
channels (Jahnsen & Llin´as, 1984a; Jahnsen & Llin´as, 1984b; Huguenard &
McCormick, 1992; McCormick & Huguenard, 1992) that jointly determine
the timing and pattern of action potentials in response to a sensory stim-
ulus; see the Appendix for a brief introduction to models of ion currents.
Depending on the initial membrane polarization, the GRC response to a vi-
sual stimulus is in a range between a tonic and a burst mode (Sherman, 1996;
Sherman & Guillery, 1996). At hyperpolarization below roughly -70 mV, a
Ca2+ current, called the low-threshold Ca2+ current or T-current (IT; T for
‘transient’), gets slowly de-inactivated. As the membrane depolarizes above
roughly -70 mV, the current activates, followed by a rapid transition from
the de-inactivated to the inactivated state, thereby producing a Ca2+ spike
with an amplitude that depends on how long and how strongly the cell has
been hyperpolarized previously. After suﬃcient hyperpolarization the Ca2+
spike will thus reach the threshold for Na+ spiking and give rise to a burst
of one to seven action potentials riding its crest (Jahnsen & Llin´as, 1984a;
Jahnsen & Llin´as, 1984b; Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick &
Huguenard, 1992). All other action potentials, i.e., those that are not pro-
moted by a Ca2+ spike and, hence, do not group into bursts, are called tonic
spikes.

Although the issue is still controversial, there is some evidence that a
mixture of burst and tonic spikes may be involved in the transmission of
visual signals in lightly anesthetized or awake animals (Guido et al., 1992;
Guido et al., 1995; Guido & Weyand, 1995; Mukherjee & Kaplan, 1995;
Sherman, 1996; Sherman & Guillery, 1996; Reinagel et al., 1999). In lagged

5

cells, because of the strong feedforward inhibition they are assumed to re-
ceive, burst spikes have been held responsible for the high-activity transient
seen at the oﬀset of their retinal input (Mastronarde, 1987a; Mastronarde,
1987b), thus contributing substantially to the delayed peak response to a
moving bar (Mastronarde, 1987b). In nonlagged cells at resting membrane
potentials below -70 mV, bursting constitutes a very early part of the vi-
sual response, producing a phase lead of up to a quarter cycle relative to
their retinal input (Lu et al., 1992; Guido et al., 1992; Mukherjee & Kaplan,
1995). At more depolarized membrane potentials nonlagged responses are
dominated by tonic spikes and are in phase with retinal input (Lu et al.,
1992; Guido et al., 1992; Mukherjee & Kaplan, 1995).

Cortical feedback to the A-laminae of the LGN, arising mainly from layer
6 of area 17 (Sherman, 1996; Sherman & Guillery, 1996), can locally mod-
ulate the response mode, and hence the timing, of GRCs by shifting their
membrane potentials on a time scale that is long as compared to retinal
inputs. This may occur directly through the action of metabotropic glu-
tamate and NMDA receptors (depolarization) (McCormick & von Krosigk,
1992; Godwin et al., 1996; Sherman, 1996; Sherman & Guillery, 1996; von
Krosigk et al., 1999) and indirectly via the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) or
geniculate interneurons by activation of GABAB receptors (hyperpolariza-
tion) of GRCs (Crunelli & Leresche, 1991; Sherman & Guillery, 1996; von
Krosigk et al., 1999).
Indeed, GRCs in vivo are dynamic and diﬀer indi-
vidually in their degree of burstiness (Lu et al., 1992; Guido et al., 1992;
Mukherjee & Kaplan, 1995). Here we explicate the causal link between the
variable response timing of GRCs and variable tuning of cortical simple cells
for speed of moving features, thus identifying control of speed tuning as a
likely mode of corticothalamic operation.

2 The Model

Before turning to our simulation results we describe in this section the un-
derlying model of the primary visual pathway.

2.1 Geniculate Input to the Primary Visual Cortex

For the GRCs we have employed a 12-channel model of the cat relay neuron
(Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick & Huguenard, 1992), adapted
to 37 degrees Celsius; see the Appendix for a brief introduction to biophysi-
cal neuron models. The neuron model includes a transient and a persistent
Na+ current, several voltage-gated K+ currents, a voltage- and Ca2+-gated
K+ current, a low- and a high-threshold Ca2+ current, a hyperpolarization-
activated mixed cation current, and Na+ and K+ leak conductances. As
shown in Figure 2A, retinal input reaches a GRC directly as excitation, and

6

indirectly via an intrageniculate interneuron as inhibition, thus establish-
ing the typical triadic synaptic circuit found in the glomeruli of X-GRCs
(Sherman & Koch, 1990; Sherman & Guillery, 1996). The temporal diﬀer-
ence between the two aﬀerent pathways equals the delay of the inhibitory
synapse and has been taken to be 1.0 ms (Mastronarde, 1987b).

As will be described in more detail below, we have found typical lagged
responses for strong feedforward inhibition with weak feedforward excita-
tion, in agreement with Mastronarde (1987b), Humphrey & Weller (1988b),
and Heggelund & Hartveit (1990). On the other hand, typical nonlagged
responses are produced by weak feedforward inhibition with strong feedfor-
ward excitation. We have therefore implemented lagged and nonlagged relay
cells in the model by varying the relative strengths of feedforward excitation
and feedforward inhibition.

It is known that both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors contribute to
retinogeniculate excitation to varying degrees, ranging from almost pure
non-NMDA to almost pure NMDA-mediated responses in individual GRCs
of both lagged and nonlagged varieties (Kwon et al., 1991). At least in
lagged cells, however, early responses and, hence, responses to the transient
stimuli that will be considered here, seem to depend to a lesser degree on
the NMDA receptor type than late responses (Kwon et al., 1991). Since the
essential characteristics of lagged and nonlagged responses apparently do
not depend on the special properties of NMDA receptors – an assumption
conﬁrmed by our results – we have chosen the postsynaptic conductances in
GRCs to be entirely of the non-NMDA type.

The time course of postsynaptic conductance change in GRCs following

reception of an input has been modeled by an alpha function,

g(t > 0) = gmax

.

(2.1)

For excitation, the rise time τ has been chosen to be 0.4 ms (Mukherjee
& Kaplan, 1995), for inhibition it is 0.8 ms. The latter value was esti-
mated from the relative durations of S potentials recorded at excitatory
and inhibitory geniculate synapses (Mastronarde, 1987b) and was found to
reproduce the rise times of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials recorded in
relay cells following stimulation of the optic chiasm (Bloomﬁeld & Sherman,
1988). The reversal potentials are for excitation 0 mV, for inhibition −85.8
mV (Bal et al., 1995).

The model system comprises 100 lagged and 100 nonlagged relay neu-
rons. Their RF centers are 0.5 degrees in diameter (Cleland et al., 1979) and
are spatially arranged in a lagged and a nonlagged cluster subtending 0.7
degrees each and displaced by 0.45 degrees; see Figure 2B. More precisely,
the central points of the RFs of lagged and nonlagged cells are uniformly
distributed within two separate intervals of 0.2 degrees each along a certain
axis, which will be the axis of bar motion during stimulation; see section 2.3.

tory/inhibitory neurons and their re-

cell (RGC) sends its axon to the lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN) and synapses
excitatorily on a relay cell (open cir-
cle) and on an intrageniculate interneu-
ron (ﬁlled circle), which in turn inhibits
the same relay cell (arrangement called
‘synaptic triad’). The relative strengths
of feedforward excitation and feedfor-
ward inhibition shape a relay cell’s re-
sponse to be of the lagged or non-
lagged type (see main text and Figure
4). There is an inhibitory feedback loop
via the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN).
The inﬂuence of cortical feedback has
been modeled as a variation of the re-
lay cells’ resting membrane potential by
control of a K+ leak current. There
is no cortical input to the PGN in the
model. Moreover, we neglect any fast
(ionotropic) cortical feedback. Possible
eﬀects of such feedback are discussed

centers of the 100 lagged and 100 non-
lagged relay cells comprising the model
LGN. These relay cells are envisaged to
project onto the same cortical simple
cell and create an on- or oﬀ-region of its
RF. In the simulations, the diameter of
a single lagged or nonlagged RF center
is 0.5 degrees. Results for rescaled ver-
sions of this geometry can be derived
straightforwardly from the simulations;
see section 4. The bar and arrow on the

direction of motion, respectively. Fig-
ure adapted from Hillenbrand & van
Hemmen (2000).

The RFs’ oﬀsets in the direction orthogonal to this axis, i.e., in the direction
that deﬁnes the preferred orientation of the bulk RF, are irrelevant as long
as the stimulus bar is long enough to pass through all RFs of the relay cells
in one sweep. In fact, the bar used in the simulations is much longer than
typical RFs of simple cells; see section 2.3.

The layout of geniculate inputs (Figure 2B) matches the basic structure
of a single on- or oﬀ-region in an RF of a directional simple cell in cortical
layer 4B onto which the GRCs are envisaged to project (Saul & Humphrey,
1992a; Saul & Humphrey, 1992b; DeAngelis et al., 1995; Jagadeesh et al.,
1997; Murthy et al., 1998). To complete the geniculate input to a RF of this
type, this lagged-nonlagged unit would have to be repeated with alternating
on-oﬀ-polarity and a spatial oﬀset that would determine the simple cell’s
preference for some spatial frequency. Since we are not concerned here
with eﬀects of spatial frequency (see previous footnote 1), omission of the
other on/oﬀ-regions does not aﬀect our conclusions. Results for rescaled
RF geometries can be derived straightforwardly from the simulations; see
section 4.

The number of geniculate cells contributing to a simple cell’s RF has been
estimated roughly from Ahmed et al. (1994). Only its order of magnitude
matters.

We have also taken into account feedback inhibition via the PGN (Lo
& Sherman, 1994; Sherman & Guillery, 1996); see Figure 2A. Connections
between PGN neurons and GRCs are all to all within, and separate for the
lagged and nonlagged populations2. Axonal plus synaptic delays are 2.0 ms
in both directions.

Intrageniculate interneurons and PGN cells, like GRCs, possess a com-
plex blend of ionic currents. They are, however, thought to be active mainly
in a tonic spiking mode during the awake state (Contreras et al., 1993; Pape
et al., 1994). For an eﬃcient usage of computational resources and time we
have therefore modeled these neurons by the spike-response model (Gerst-
ner & van Hemmen, 1992), which gives a reasonable approximation to tonic
spiking (Kistler et al., 1997). Note that for the present model it is irrelevant
whether transmission across dendrodendritic synapses between intragenicu-
late interneurons and GRCs actually occurs with or without spikes; cf. Cox
et al. (1998). For a relay neuron, all that matters is the fact that an excita-
tory retinal input is mostly followed by an inhibitory input (Bloomﬁeld &
Sherman, 1988). The spike-response neurons have been given an adaptive
spike output, implemented as an accumulating refractory potential (Gerst-
ner & van Hemmen, 1992), i.e., there is some adaptation of transmission

2This synaptic separation of the lagged and the nonlagged pathways was implemented
solely to allow for independent simulation of the two. Although an inhibitory coupling
of lagged and nonlagged cells could in reality cause some anti-correlation of their ﬁring,
there is no evidence for anti-correlation of GRCs. Any such eﬀects thus seem negligible.
In any case, they would not aﬀect our conclusions.

across the dendrodendritic synapses. The refractory potential, and hence
the eﬀect of adaptation, saturates on a time scale of 10.0 ms.

2.2 Cortical Feedback

Metabotropic glutamate receptors eﬀect a closing of K+ leak channels and
a membrane depolarization, while GABAB receptors, via PGN or genicu-
late interneurons, eﬀect an opening of K+ leak channels and a membrane
hyperpolarization. Accordingly, we have incorporated the inﬂuence of corti-
cal feedback to the thalamus by varying the K+ leak conductance of GRCs
(McCormick & von Krosigk, 1992; Godwin et al., 1996); see Figure 2A. The
resulting stationary membrane potential in the absence of any retinal input
will be called resting membrane potential. All GRCs, lagged and nonlagged,
have been assigned the same resting membrane potential; here we assume
a uniform action of cortical feedback at least on the scale of single RFs in
area 17. By varying the resting membrane potential we investigate a strictly
modulatory role of corticogeniculate feedback, as opposed to the retinal in-
puts that drive relay cells to ﬁre; cf. Sherman & Guillery (1996), Crick &
Koch (1998).

For every single stimulus presentation (see below) we have kept the
K+ leak conductance constant. This is justiﬁed by the slow action, com-
pared to typical passage times of local stimulus features through RFs, of the
metabotropic receptors, ranging from hundreds of milliseconds for GABAB
to seconds for metabotropic glutamate receptors (von Krosigk et al., 1999).
Nonetheless, it is clear that dynamics in the corticogeniculate pathway may
produce eﬀects for slow-moving stimuli that we here cannot account for.

In modeling cortical feedback we neglect input to the LGN that is medi-
ated by ionotropic receptors and, hence, acts on a much shorter timescale.
Furthermore, we do not explicitly model cortical input to the PGN. The
eﬀects those inputs may have on our results are discussed in section 4.

2.3 Stimulation

The input to GRCs has been modeled as a set of Poisson spike trains with
time-varying ﬁring rates. For investigation of the temporal transfer charac-
teristics of lagged and nonlagged neurons, these rates varied sinusoidally be-
tween 0 and 100 spikes/s (amplitude 50 spikes/s, DC component 50 spikes/s)
at a range of temporal frequencies. Before any responses to sinusoidal stim-
uli have been collected, the stimuli were presented for 1 second, that is,
depending on the frequency, between 1 and 11 cycles. We have recorded the
response for the following 100 seconds of stimulus presentation.

For studying the responses to moving bars, rates have been ﬁtted to
recordings from retinal ganglion cells in response to moving, thin (0.1 de-
grees), long (10 degrees) bars (Cleland & Harding, 1983). The ﬁt for a single

homogeneous Poisson process. The peak
rate rp and the width of the response
peak have been adjusted for diﬀerent bar
speeds to ﬁt the data of Cleland & Hard-
ing (1983). The background rate r0 is
taken to be 38 spikes/s (Mastronarde,
1987b).

We have studied bar responses of single lagged and nonlagged neurons
as well as of the entire population of 100 lagged and 100 nonlagged neurons
in the geniculate model. Accordingly, bars were moved across single RFs of
relay cells or the whole bulk RF in the preferred and anti-preferred direc-
tions; see Figure 2B. Bar motion always started 3 ∆ (cf. equation 2.2) before
it hit the ﬁrst RF center, and stopped 3 ∆ after it had passed the last RF
center. There was a 1 second interval of stimulation with the background
activity (38 spikes/s) between bar sweeps.

2.4 Data Analysis

We collected spike times with 0.1 ms resolution. Spikes of single relay neu-
rons in response to moving bars were counted in bins of 5 ms, a timescale
relevant to postsynaptic integration, for variable synaptic excitatory and in-
hibitory input strengths. The bin counts have been averaged over 100 bar
sweeps at each velocity and synaptic setting.

Spikes of single lagged and nonlagged neurons in response to sinusoidal
stimulation with variable frequency ω were counted in a time window of
5 ms shifted by steps of 1 ms. The spike counts were averaged over all
cycles of the stimulus presented within 100 seconds of stimulation. For
the resulting spike-count functions we determined the amplitude F1(ω) and

11

the phase φ1(ω) of their ﬁrst Fourier component. With the amplitude A
(= 50 spikes/s; see section 2.3) and the phase ψ of the sinusoidal input rate,
we have calculated the amplitude-transfer function F1(ω)/A and the phase-
transfer function ψ − φ1(ω); negative phase transfer means phase lead over
the input.

For the investigation of velocity tuning, spikes of all 100 lagged and
100 nonlagged relay cells were pooled. For each velocity v of bar motion
tested, we calculated the total lagged and nonlagged response rates rl(v, t)
and rnl(v, t), respectively, as spike counts in 5 ms windows shifted by steps
of 1 ms (t = 1, 2, . . . ms). The velocity tuning of the pooled lagged and
nonlagged peak rates per neuron is

Rℓ(v) =

rℓ(v, t) ,

ℓ = l, nl ,

(2.3)

max
t∈[ti,tf ]

where the times ti and tf are chosen such that all of the response to a bar
sweep lies in the interval [ti, tf ].

We are primarily interested in the total geniculate input to a cortical
simple cell onto which the GRCs are envisaged to project. To this end,
we shifted lagged spikes by 2 ms to later times in order to account for
the fact that the lagged cells’ conduction times to cortex are slightly longer
than those of the nonlagged cells (Mastronarde, 1987a; Humphrey & Weller,
1988a). Furthermore, although lagged responses in the LGN tend to be
weaker than nonlagged responses (Mastronarde, 1987a; Humphrey & Weller,
1988a; Saul & Humphrey, 1990), they appear to be about equally eﬃcient
in driving cortical simple cells (Saul & Humphrey, 1992a). The cortical
(possibly synaptic) cause being beyond the scope of this work, we simply
counted every lagged spike twice to obtain the velocity tuning of the eﬀective
geniculate input to a cortical cell,

R(v) =

1
100

max
t∈[ti,tf ]

[2 rl(v, t − 2 ms) + rnl(v, t)] .

(2.4)

The peak input rate R(v) per lagged-nonlagged pair is correlated with
simple-cell activity because postsynaptic potentials are summed almost lin-
early in simple cells (Jagadeesh et al., 1993; Kontsevich, 1995; Jagadeesh
et al., 1997).

The total geniculate input rate R(v) to a cortical neuron depends on (i)
the magnitude of the pooled lagged and nonlagged response peaks, Rl(v) and
Rnl(v), respectively, and (ii) their relative timing. To diﬀerentiate between
these two factors we determined the times tl(v) and tnl(v) of the maxima of
the lagged and nonlagged response rates, respectively,

tℓ(v) = arg max
t∈[ti,tf ]

rℓ(v, t) ,

ℓ = l, nl ,

(2.5)

12

and calculated the peak-time diﬀerences tnl(v)−tl(v) as a function of the bar
velocity v. Means and standard errors have been estimated from a sample
of 30 bar sweeps at each bar velocity.

2.5 Numerics

The model is described by a high-dimensional system of nonlinear, coupled,
stochastic diﬀerential equations. For numerical integration of the GRC dy-
namics we used an adaptive ﬁfth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm3 (Press et al.,
1992). The maximal time step was 0.02 ms and was scaled down to satisfy
upper bounds on the estimated error per time step. Increasing or decreas-
ing those bounds by a factor of 10 had negligible eﬀects on the time course
of the membrane potential of a GRC, and no eﬀect on spike timing within
the temporal resolution of 0.1 ms we used for recording. The dynamics of
spike-response neurons was solved by exact integrals.

Each simulation started with a 3 second period without any stimulus
to allow the GRCs’ dynamics to converge on its stationary (resting) state.
Simulations were run on an IBM SP2 parallel computer.

3 Results

We ﬁrst address the response properties of single relay neurons in the model,
and then turn to the total geniculate input to a cortical neuron.

3.1 Lagged and Nonlagged Relay Neurons

We have checked whether both lagged- and nonlagged-type responses could
be produced within our model by simply varying the synaptic strengths of
feedforward excitation and feedforward inhibition of relay neurons; see Fig-
ure 2A. Varying the peak postsynaptic conductances gmax (equation 2.1)
for excitation and inhibition and stimulating with a bar moving at 4 deg/s
we found a lagged-nonlagged transition that is analogous to a ﬁrst-order
phase transition in response timing; see Figure 4 for an example at a resting
membrane potential of −65 mV. At strong excitation and weak inhibition
there is a response peak with zero delay relative to the input peak. As
the excitation is reduced and the inhibition increased, this nonlagged peak
shrinks while a lagged peak develops. The latter invariably has a delay of
roughly 100 ms relative to the input peak, a value consistent with experi-

3An algorithm for numeric integration of ordinary diﬀerential equations is said to be of
nth order, if the error per time step δt is of order δtn+1. Note that, because of discontinu-
ities in the system of diﬀerential equations (Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick
& Huguenard, 1992), more sophisticated and faster methods for integration than Runge-
Kutta cannot be safely applied.

mental data (Mastronarde, 1987a); cf. Figure 1B. At strong inhibition and
weak excitation the lagged peak is the dominant part of the response.

We have also checked the dependence of relay-cell responses on their
resting membrane potential. The peak postsynaptic conductances gmax for
the lagged cell have now been ﬁxed at 0.0125 µS for excitation and at 0.25
µS for inhibition; for the nonlagged cell they have been ﬁxed at 0.05 µS
for excitation and at 0.0125 µS for inhibition; cf. Figure 4.
In Figure 5
we show the bar response (4 deg/s) and the temporal transfer of amplitude
and phase of a lagged and a nonlagged neuron for the resting membrane
potentials −72 mV and −61 mV. Again, the response data agree well with
experiments (Mastronarde, 1987a; Saul & Humphrey, 1990; Lu et al., 1992;
Guido et al., 1992; Mukherjee & Kaplan, 1995). In particular, the lagged
cell’s response shows a phase lag relative to the input that increases with
frequency; the nonlagged cell goes through a transition between a low-pass
and in-phase relay mode to a band-pass and phase-lead (at frequencies < 8
Hz) relay mode as the membrane hyperpolarizes. The former corresponds
to the tonic, the latter to the burst relay mode.

Remarkably, as the resting membrane potential is varied, the timing
of the bar response shifts in opposite directions for lagged and nonlagged
cells; cf. Figure 5 left column. Increasing hyperpolarization shifts the lagged
response peak to later times, while the nonlagged response peak moves to
earlier times. In view of what we have reported in section 1.2 on relay modes
and lagged cells, it seems likely that the low-threshold Ca2+ current IT is
in part responsible for the GRCs’ response timing.
In Figure 6 we show
simulated traces of IT for the moving-bar scenarios. For nonlagged neurons,
the current is insigniﬁcant at −61 mV, but exhibits a pronounced peak at
the start of the response to the bar at −72 mV. The peak of IT conﬁrms the
nature of the early response component seen in Figure 5 top left column as
Ca2+-mediated burst spikes, in agreement with Lu et al. (1992), Guido et al.
(1992), and Mukherjee & Kaplan (1995). For lagged neurons, on the other
hand, we see that the timing of the IT peak faithfully reﬂects the timing of
the response peak at both resting membrane potentials; see Figure 5 bottom
left column. In fact, the proﬁle of the IT traces resembles the one of the
spike rates, indicating that the Ca2+ current promotes ﬁring throughout
the transient responses simulated here. We will return to the signiﬁcance of
burst spikes for the results in section 4.

The reason for the opposite shifts of lagged and nonlagged response tim-
ing, then, lies in the interaction of the low-threshold Ca2+ current IT with
the diﬀerent levels of inhibition received by lagged and nonlagged neurons.
With only weak feedforward inhibition, nonlagged neurons respond to reti-
nal input with immediate depolarization, eventually reaching the activation
threshold for the Ca2+ current. If the Ca2+ current is in the de-inactivated
state, it will boost depolarization and give rise to an early burst compo-
nent of the visual response. The lower the resting membrane potential,

this parameter space are at low excitation with high inhibition and at high
excitation with low inhibition, respectively. The resting membrane potential
is −65 mV. Responses are averaged over 100 bar sweeps.

Figure 5: Dependence of moving-bar response and temporal transfer func-
tion of single modeled relay neurons on their resting membrane potential.
Typical nonlagged responses (top row, gmax = 0.05 µS for excitation and
0.0125 µS for inhibition) and lagged responses (bottom row, gmax = 0.0125
µS for excitation and 0.25 µS for inhibition; cf. Figure 4) have been repro-
duced at the two resting membrane potentials −72 mV (solid lines) and −61
mV (dashed lines). For the bar responses (leftmost column) the time of the
retinal input peak has been set to zero. As the membrane is hyperpolar-
ized, the nonlagged bar-response peak shifts to earlier times. Conversely,
the lagged bar response shifts to later times. The changes in bar-response
timing are also reﬂected in corresponding changes in the phase-transfer func-
tions (rightmost column). Bar responses are averaged over 100 bar sweeps.
Amplitude and phase transfer have been calculated from responses to sinu-
soidal input rates, averaged over 100 seconds. Note the diﬀerent scales on
the “cycles” axes for nonlagged and lagged cells.

the more de-inactivated and, hence, stronger the Ca2+ current will be, and
the stronger the early burst relative to the late tonic response component.
Lagged neurons, on the other hand, receive strong feedforward inhibition
and, hence, initially respond to retinal input with hyperpolarization. Re-
polarization occurs when inhibition gets weaker. This may result either
from cessation of retinal input or from adaptation, i.e., fatigue, of the in-
hibitory input to GRCs; cf. Figure 2A. With the Ca2+ current IT being
de-inactivated by the excursion of the membrane potential to low values,
lagged spiking starts with burst spikes as soon as the voltage reaches the
Ca2+-activation threshold. This will take longer, if the resting membrane
potential is lower, leading to the shift in response timing with membrane
polarization observed here.

Adaptation of inhibition is implemented in the present model by the
refractoriness of the spike-response neurons that represent the inhibitory
interneurons; cf. section 2.1. The refractory potential saturates, however,
on a timescale (10.0 ms) much shorter than the delay of the lagged response
of roughly 100 ms; cf. Figure 5. Its role in generating a response delay for
lagged neurons in our model can thus be only very limited.

It is important to note that the lagged on-response is diﬀerent from a
nonlagged oﬀ-response. A nonlagged oﬀ-response produces a phase lag of
half a cycle relative to the nonlagged on-response at all frequencies. The
right column of Figure 5 shows that this is not true for the simulated lagged
response. Rather, the phase-transfer function has a signiﬁcantly higher slope
– that is, a higher phase latency – for the lagged response than for the non-
lagged response (cf. Saul & Humphrey, 1990) at both resting membrane
potentials. Moreover, we observed that lagged cells produce a delay of
moving-bar responses that does not vanish at high speeds (not shown). This
ﬁxed delay component must be largely determined by the internal neuronal
dynamics of the ion currents, notably of IT, that follows hyperpolarization.
For the remaining simulations we have always set the peak postsynaptic
conductances for lagged and nonlagged neurons to the values used for the
data shown in Figures 5 and 6.

3.2 Total Geniculate Input to Cortex

Lagged and nonlagged responses have to be combined so as to yield a
velocity-selective input to a cortical neuron. For diﬀerent values of the rest-

17

ing membrane potential, Figure 7 shows in the columns from left to right the
velocity tuning of the lagged population (Rl), of the nonlagged population
(Rnl), the peak-time diﬀerences (tnl − tl) of their responses for the preferred
direction, and the tuning of the total geniculate input (R) to a cortical cell
for the preferred and nonpreferred direction of motion; see section 2.4 for
details. As in vivo, the lagged cells prefer lower velocities and have lower
peak ﬁring rates than the nonlagged cells (Mastronarde, 1987a; Humphrey
& Weller, 1988a; Saul & Humphrey, 1990). The key observation, however,
is that the maximum of the total geniculate input rate to a cortical neu-
ron shifts to lower velocities as the membrane potential hyperpolarizes; see
Figure 7 right column.

The total geniculate input rate R assumes its maximum at a velocity of
bar motion where the peak discharges of the lagged and nonlagged neurons
coincide, i.e., where tnl − tl ≈ 0. The shift of the maximum with hyper-
polarization to lower velocities is produced by a corresponding shift of the
peak-time diﬀerences tnl − tl and of the lagged tuning Rl, while the maxi-
mum of the nonlagged tuning Rnl remains essentially unchanged. The shift
of the peak-time diﬀerences, in turn, is a reﬂection of the opposite shifts
in bar-response timing of lagged and nonlagged neurons described in the
previous subsection; cf. Figure 5 left column. The total geniculate input
rate R is higher for the direction of bar motion where tnl − tl assumes lower
values. In other words, the direction preferred is the one where the lagged
cells receive their retinal input before the nonlagged cells; cf. Figures 2B
and 7 right column.

We found that feedback inhibition from the PGN does not aﬀect the tim-
ing of lagged and nonlagged responses. Its only eﬀect is to reduce variations
in response amplitude by countering increases in ﬁring rate of relay neurons
with stronger inhibition. The PGN feedback loop thus moderates the diﬀer-
ences in response activity both at diﬀerent levels of the resting membrane
potential and between lagged and nonlagged neurons. The latter diﬀerence
may be further reduced by making the feedback inhibition stronger for non-
lagged than for lagged neurons. For the data shown in Figure 7 this has
been implemented by allowing stronger or, equivalently, more synapses of
nonlagged neurons on PGN cells than synapses of lagged neurons. Despite
this, the nonlagged responses dominate and there is a drop of geniculate ac-
tivity, especially of the lagged responses, with increasing hyperpolarization.
We will return to this issue in section 4. In general, however, the PGN loop
increases the range of resting membrane potentials of relay cells that yield
balanced lagged and nonlagged inputs to the cortex, thereby extending the
dynamic range of speed tuning of the total geniculate input to a cortical
neuron.

Figure 7: Geniculate moving-bar response and geniculate input to cortex as
predicted by model simulations. Velocity tuning and timing of the response
peaks have been plotted for resting membrane potentials indicated on the
far left. In the columns we show from left to right as functions of the bar
velocity the peak response rate of the lagged population (Rl), of the non-
lagged population (Rnl), their peak-time diﬀerence (tnl −tl) for the preferred
direction, and the total geniculate input (R) to a cortical cell for the pre-
ferred (solid lines) and nonpreferred (dashed lines) direction of motion. The
horizontal axes show the logarithm (base 2) of speed in all graphs. The bars
in the graphs are standard errors. As the membrane is hyperpolarized, the
total geniculate input to a cortical cell peaks at progressively lower veloci-
ties. Means and standard errors are estimated from 30 bar sweeps. Figure

4 Discussion

Recently it has been proposed that corticogeniculate feedback modulates
the spatial layout of simple-cell RFs by exploiting the thalamic burst-tonic
transition of relay modes (W¨org¨otter et al., 1998). Along a similar line, the
main point made by our modeling is that one should expect a modulatory
inﬂuence of cortical feedback on the spatiotemporal RF structure of simple
cells. More precisely, we observe a shift in the time to the bar-response peak
that is opposite for lagged and nonlagged cells; cf. Figure 5 left column.
Assuming (i) an RF layout as usually found for direction-selective simple
cells in area 17, and (ii) an inﬂuence of convergent geniculate lagged and

19

nonlagged inputs on this RF structure, it follows that the observed shifts in
response timing aﬀect cortical speed tuning. To the best of our knowledge,
nobody has looked for such an eﬀect yet.

We have investigated the geniculate input to simple cells, which clearly
cannot be compared with their output directly. Because of intracortical
processing we cannot expect to reproduce tuning widths and direction se-
lectivity indices of cortical neurons. Rather, the tuning width of geniculate
input is likely to be larger, and its directional selectivity weaker than of a
cortical neuron’s output; cf. section 1.1. Indeed, superﬁcial inspection of the
rightmost column of Figure 7 reveals that the directional bias of R is rather
weak compared to what can be found for directional cells in cat areas 17
and 18 (Orban et al., 1981a). On the other hand, the tuning width of R is
relatively narrow (Orban et al., 1981b), instead of wide. The narrowness of
speed tuning in our simulations may be reconciled with experimental data in
the following ways. First, we have simulated the ideal case of equal resting
membrane potential, and hence lagged and nonlagged response timing, for
all of the GRCs. Scattered values of membrane potentials will produce less
sharply tuned proﬁles for R. Second, if it is true that velocity tuning is not a
static but a dynamic property of cortical cells, as is proposed in this article,
measured – eﬀective – tuning widths should be larger than the width of the
tuning under static conditions as simulated here.

Quantitative comparison of the tuning of R with cortical velocity tuning
is, for the above reasons, problematic. Nonetheless it is interesting to note
that, much like velocity tuning in areas 17 and 18 (Orban et al., 1981b),
the dynamic range of the modeled geniculate input – that is, the diﬀerence
between the highest and the lowest response values on each tuning curve
R(v) – decreases and the tuning width increases with decreasing optimal
velocity4; see Figure 7 right column. Moreover, the range of preferred ve-
locities lies within the range observed for velocity-tuned cells (Orban et al.,
1981b).

Because of scaling properties of the retinal ganglion cells’ velocity tuning
(Cleland & Harding, 1983), rescaled versions of the RF geometry shown in
Figure 2B produce accordingly shifted tuning curves (on a logarithmic speed
scale). In particular, we retrieve the positive correlation between RF size
and preferred speed found in areas 17 and 18 (Orban et al., 1981b) from the
geniculate input.

The eﬀects of lagged and nonlagged response timing in the present model
are dependent on the low-threshold Ca2+ current and ensuing burst spikes.
The signiﬁcance of our results for visual processing in the awake, behaving
animal, then, is subject to the occurrence of burst spikes under such con-
ditions. As mentioned in section 1.2, this issue is still under much debate.
For nonlagged cells, burst spikes will have a role in normal vision only, if

4The correlation with tuning width was signiﬁcant only in area 18 (Orban et al., 1981b).

their resting membrane potential gets hyperpolarized enough. For lagged
cells, it is presently not settled, if their (transient) responses are indeed sup-
ported by the low-threshold Ca2+ current, as was seen in the simulations.
If this turns out to be wrong, the eﬀect of cortical input on lagged response
timing could be diﬀerent from what we have observed.
In this regard, it
would be interesting to study the eﬀect of additional NMDA channels at
the synapses of retinal aﬀerents on GRCs; cf. Heggelund & Hartveit (1990)
and Hartveit & Heggelund (1990). Nonetheless, the data on response timing
of the modeled lagged cells suggest that some essential aspect of the true
lagged mechanism has been captured in the model.

Responses of X-relay cells to moving bars and textures are on average
reduced after ablation of the visual cortex in cats (Gulyas et al., 1990). This
is consistent with what we observe in our simulations of relay cells, assuming
a depolarizing net eﬀect of cortical feedback on relay neurons (Funke &
Eysel, 1992; W¨org¨otter et al., 1998). In fact, the response rates of lagged and
nonlagged neurons decrease with progressive hyperpolarization (cf. Figure 7
ﬁrst and second columns), despite disinhibition by PGN feedback.

The question arises of how the visual cortex would deal with the re-
sulting diﬀerences in the maximal geniculate input activity (cf. Figure 7
right column) in a way that preserves the speed tuning of the aﬀerent signal
for a wide range of geniculate membrane polarizations.
In principle this
is straightforward since it is area 17 itself that modulates the membrane
potential of relay cells. By a similar mechanism it could likewise adjust
the responsiveness of layer 4B neurons to geniculate input. An appropri-
ate modulatory signal could most easily be derived from the same layer 6
neurons that project to the LGN, or from their neighbors that share the
same information on the actual corticothalamic feedback. In this context it
is very interesting that layer 6 neurons that project to the LGN indeed send
axon collaterals speciﬁcally to layer 4 (Katz, 1987).

The PGN, and more generally the thalamic reticular nucleus, implements
both a disynaptic inhibitory feedback loop and an indirect corticothalamic
feedback pathway to relay cells (Sherman, 1996; Sherman & Guillery, 1996).
This double role suggests possible interactions between the two functions.
Depending on whether or not individual PGN neurons engage in both types
of circuitry and on the details of connections between diﬀerent PGN neu-
rons, the strength of the disynaptic feedback inhibition exerted by PGN
neurons on GRCs could be modulated by cortical feedback. Unlike in our
simulations, the eﬃciency of the LGN-PGN loop might thus covary with
the GRCs’ resting membrane potential. In theory this would oﬀer a very
elegant mechanism to compensate the above-mentioned diﬀerences in GRC-
response level at diﬀerent resting membrane potentials. For the time being
this is, of course, mere speculation.

Recently, it has been found that responses in the thalamic reticular nu-
cleus of rat that are mediated by a speciﬁc subtype of metabotropic gluta-

21

mate receptor (group II) result in long-lasting cell hyperpolarization (Cox &
Sherman, 1999), instead of depolarization as usually. The eﬀect seems to be
caused by opening of a K+ leak channel similar to a GABAB response. This
observation adds some more variants of possible corticothalamic pathways
for the slow control of thalamic membrane potential. Speciﬁcally, it suggests
that relay cells may be depolarized by reticular disinhibition. Moreover, if
group II receptors turned out to be active on relay neurons as they are on
reticular neurons, a direct hyperpolarizing eﬀect of corticothalamic feedback
would become conceivable.

In the model we have considered only one type of cortical input to the
LGN, namely, the input mediated by metabotropic receptors that slowly
control a K+ leak conductance on GRCs; cf. section 2.2. There are other
cortical inputs, mediated by ionotropic receptors, that act on the much
shorter timescale of the retinal inputs. While such cortical feedback cer-
tainly inﬂuences the detailed temporal pattern of geniculate spiking [see,
e.g., Sillito et al. (1994)], it seems unlikely that they aﬀect the gross timing
of a transient response peak on a timescale of several 10 ms. An inter-
esting exception is perhaps NMDA receptor-mediated feedback, with time
constants in-between those of metabotropic and (ionotropic) AMPA/kainate
or GABAA responses. In future work it would be, therefore, interesting to
include NMDA channels at corticothalamic synapses in the model.

We have presented arguments for the existence of a particular dynamic
gating mechanism for thalamocortical information transfer, namely, for the
transfer of information on visual motion. New experiments are required
to check the implications directly.
If the proposed mechanism turns out
to be eﬀective in awake, behaving animals, it will have important, as yet
unrecognized, consequences for motion processing. A possible implication
in motion-mediated object segmentation is discussed in Hillenbrand & van
Hemmen (2000).

Appendix

We here give a brief account of essential concepts that are related to bio-
physical neuron models and, in particular, to the model of the thalamic relay
neuron (Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick & Huguenard, 1992)
studied in this work. For a detailed exposition of data and theory on ion
channels and excitable membranes the reader is referred to Tuckwell (1988a,
1988b) and Hille (1992).

The essential electrical properties of neuronal membranes are described

by the diﬀerential equation

dV
dt

=

1
C

Ii ,

n

Xi=1

22

(A.1)

where V is the cell’s membrane potential, Ii are the currents through the
diﬀerent types of ion channels in the membrane, and C is the membrane
capacitance. The art of building a neuron model is to ﬁnd good empirical,
quantitative descriptions of all the relevant ion currents. Equation A.1 de-
scribes a point-like neuron or a single compartment of an extended neuron.
Thalamic relay neurons are well described by single-compartment models
(Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick & Huguenard, 1992).

Ii = gi mpi

i (Vi − V ) ,

Within the Ohmic approximation, the ion currents are described by
i hqi
with the reversal potential Vi, the maximal conductance gi, the gates mi
and hi, and some positive, usually integer, constants pi and qi. The reversal
potential Vi is approximately equal to the Nernst potential for ions of type
i but is usually determined empirically. The gates mi and hi are dynamic
variables that assume values between zero and one according to diﬀerential
equations that involve the membrane potential V ; see below.

(A.2)

It must be stressed that expressions of type A.2 are primarily empirical
ﬁts to the voltage dependence of ionic currents. Nonetheless, an oversim-
pliﬁed but intuitive physical interpretation of A.2 is that ion currents ﬂow
through an ensemble of channels of type i that have pi m-gates and qi h-
gates each. The gates are open and closed with certain probabilities. An
individual channel allows ions to pass only if all its gates are in the open
state.

In what follows we will drop the index i for notational simplicity. With
the given picture of ionic gates in mind, we may ‘understand’ the dynamics
of the gates m and h. Transitions between the open and closed states are
governed by the transition rates αm/h and βm/h,

The rates, in turn, are functions of the membrane potential V . Instead of
transition rates, one may specify the gates’ asymptotic values m∞ and h∞,
and time constants τm/h. Their relation to the transition rates is

dm

= αm(V ) (1 − m) − βm(V ) m ,

= αh(V ) (1 − h) − βh(V ) h .

.

(A.7)

By convention, the m-gate is usually the one that opens (m∞ ≈ 1) at higher
and closes (m∞ ≈ 0) at lower membrane potentials; for the h-gate the

23

situation is just the other way round. The m-gate is called the activation
gate, the h-gate the inactivation gate. Accordingly, a current is said to
activate when the m-gate opens; it is said to inactivate when the h-gate
closes.

For the ﬁring pattern of thalamic relay neurons, the transient and low-
threshold Ca2+ current IT is of particular importance. Analogous to the
production of Na+ spikes by the transient Na+ current INa, IT produces
Ca2+ spikes that, in turn, can promote Na+ spikes; see section 1.2.

Some types of ion channels do not inactivate, i.e., they have q = 0. An
ion channel that neither inactivates nor de-activates, i.e., p = q = 0, is called
a leak channel. Leak channels are characterized by a constant conductance
g; cf. equation A.2.

For some ion channels the Ohmic approximation A.2 for the ion current

I is not satisfactory. In those cases Goldman’s constant-ﬁeld equation

I = g mp hq V z2e2
kT

ci − ce exp(−zeV /kT )
1 − exp(−zeV /kT )

(A.8)

often is a better choice (Tuckwell, 1988a). Here ci and ce are the ion’s
concentrations in the intra- and extracellular space, respectively, and z is its
valence. As usually, e is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant,
and T is the absolute temperature. For the thalamic relay neuron, the Ca2+
currents are modeled according to equation A.8.

Besides the voltage-gated channels introduced here, thalamic relay neu-
rons have channels that are gated by membrane potential and the intracellu-
lar concentration of Ca2+ ions (Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick
& Huguenard, 1992). Their transition rates α and β [cf. equations A.3 and
A.4] are functions of membrane voltage and intracellular Ca2+ concentra-
tion. Moreover, receptor-gated channels are responsible for most of the
synaptic transmission in the central nervous system; cf. equation 2.1.

A molecular dynamics simulation of a Lennard-Jones ﬂuid, and a trajectory of the B1 im-
munoglobulin G-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (B1-IgG) simulated in water are ana-
lyzed by recurrence quantiﬁcation. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the technique for the
discrimination of phase sensitive dynamics. Physical interpretation of the recurrence parameters is
also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The quantitative analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories implies the need for the individuation of salient
phenomena embodied in time series data: unique patterns in the dynamics require taxonomies. This need has
engendered, as a consequence, the use of classical multivariate data analysis techniques such as principal components
analysis (PCA) [1,2] and cluster analysis (CA) [3].

An important criterion for the choice of analysis method for MD trajectories is the method’s dependence on
dynamical components of the data set, and its relative independence from purely statistical characteristics. This
requirement is expressible in terms of “phase information” sensitivity, and is broadly deﬁned as having properties
that are destroyed by random shuﬄing of the series itself (shuﬄing sensitive information). From this perspective,
the usual statistical descriptors (e.g., mean, rms) do not carry any phase information (shuﬄing resistant), while both
PCA and CA retain some information about the dynamics of the system (shuﬄing sensitive).

In a previous paper [4], we introduced recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis (RQA) as an alternative analysis technique
to obtain phase information about the energy landscape of simulated polypeptide systems. This technique, proposed
by Eckmann, Kamphorst and Ruelle as a purely graphical tool and made quantitative by Zbilut and Webber [5–7],
in contradistinction to PCA, gives a local view of the studied series, thus being particularly suited for the detection
of fast transients [8], and the consequent localization in time of the salient features of the dynamics. Furthermore
RQA’s independence from stationarity constraints [7,8], and its ability to discriminate between signals and random
noise [9], make RQA well-suited for a detailed characterization of MD trajectories (e.g., identiﬁcation of microstates).
In this work, RQA was applied to the potential energy time series of conformational space explored during MD
simulations. The main goal was to demonstrate the ability of RQA to discriminate the dynamics of a simple system
[a Lennard-Jones (LJ) ﬂuid, which does not carry any phase information, since it is a purely statistical, shuﬄing-
resistant system] from a complex system, such as the MD trajectory of B1-IgG simulated in water (a protein that
demonstrates shuﬄing-sensitive phase information, due to the existence of structured paths between its microstates)
[10].

The testing strategy is straightforward: while in the case of an LJ ﬂuid the RQA parameters must remain in-
variant after shuﬄing, they should change signiﬁcantly in the case of the protein. We will try to sketch a physical
characterization of RQA parameters relative to MD.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. LJ system MD simulations

For the LJ simulation, we considered a system of 125 particles, enclosed in a cube of side L, with periodic boundary

conditions interacting through a two-body potential of the LJ type:

V (r) = 4[(σ/r)12 − (σ/r)6]

(1)

with the parameter, σ = 3.405˚A, corresponding to argon, so the energies are expressed in units of ǫ (ǫ = 119.8K)
[11]. The simulations were performed at diﬀerent temperatures and varying L at diﬀerent density. We used the
same protocol for both simulations: as a ﬁrst step, the initial velocities were taken from a Maxwellian distribution to
perform 200 ps of simulation with only the last 100 ps being used for analysis. The potential energy time series was
sampled at 0.05 ps.

B. Protein MD simulation

All simulations of the protein were performed with the GROMACS simulation package [12]. A modiﬁcation [13]
of the GROMOS87 [14] force ﬁeld was used with additional terms for aromatic hydrogens [15] and improved carbon-
oxygen interaction parameters [13]. SHAKE [16] was used to constrain bond lengths, allowing a time step of 2
fs.

The initial protein conﬁguration was taken from the protein databank (1pga) [17]. The protein was immersed in a
pre-equilibrated box of SPC water [18], while 4 water molecules with the highest electrostatic potential were replaced
by sodium ions, resulting in an electrically neutral cubic box (a ≃ 4.1 nm) containing 1790 water molecules and 4
sodium counter ions for a total of 5936 atoms. Care was taken that all crystallographic water molecules be conserved.
In order to prepare the solvated system for molecular dynamics, a three step procedure was followed. Using a
restraining harmonic potential, all heavy atoms of the protein and the crystallographic water oxygens were constrained
to their initial positions while surrounding SPC water molecules were ﬁrst minimized and then submitted to 5 ps of
constant volume MD at 300 K. The resulting system was then minimized, without any constraints, before starting
constant temperature and constant volume MD. A nonbonded cutoﬀ of 1.2 nm was used for both LJ and Coulomb
potentials. The pair lists were updated every ten steps. A constant temperature of 300 K was maintained by coupling
to an external bath [19] using a coupling constant (τ = 0.002) equal to the integration time step (2 fs). A total of 1.9
ns of simulation were produced in this manner. The potential energy of the protein was sampled every 0.1 ps.

III. RECURRENCE QUANTIFICATION ANALYSIS (RQA)

RQA was ﬁrst introduced to the physical sciences by Eckmann, Kamphorst and Ruelle in 1987 [5] as a purely
graphical technique. Five years later Zbilut and Webber [6] enhanced the technique by deﬁning ﬁve nonlinear descrip-
tors of the recurrence plot that were found to be diagnostically useful in the quantitative assessment of time series
structure in ﬁelds ranging from molecular dynamics to physiology [4,20,21]. This technique has been demonstrated
to be particularly useful in quantifying transient behavior far from equilibrium in relatively short time series [8]. This
feature is particularly important in the detection of unique patterns in complex data sets [22].

RQA is based on the computation of a Euclidean distance matrix between the rows (epoch) of an embedded matrix
of the series at a ﬁxed lag [23]. Speciﬁcally, the sequence of vectors (xi), embedded in ℜn (in this case n is set to 10 to
account for probable noise), deﬁne a function on an n × n array according to the rule: darken the ( i, j)th element of
the array if xj ∈ B(xi, r), where B(xi, r) is the ball or radius r, centered at xi (see [4,7] for details). The features of the
distance function make the plot symmetric Di,j = Dj,i with a darkened main diagonal corresponding to the identity
line (Di,j = 0; j = i). The darkened points individuate the recurrences (recurrent points) of the dynamical process
and the plot can be considered as a global picture of the autocorrelation structure of the system. Consequently, a
recurrence plot visualizes the distance matrix, which, in turn, represents the autocorrelation present in the series at

2

all the possible time scales. In fact, it is important to note that the distance is computed for all the possible pairs of
epochs, the elements near the principal diagonal of the plot corresponding to short range correlations (the diagonal
marks the identity in time), and the long range correlations corresponding to points distant from the main diagonal.
Besides the global impression given by the graphic appearance of the plot (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, for the RQA plot
of the protein and the ﬂuid) the indexes developed by Webber and Zbilut [7,8] allow for a quantitative description of
the recurrence structure of the plot. The RQA descriptors are: REC = recurrence, which quantiﬁes the percentage
of the plot occupied by recurrent points. It corresponds to the proportion of recurrent pairs over all the possible
pairs of epochs or, equivalently, the proportion of pairwise distances below the chosen radius among all the computed
distances. DET = determinism, and is the percentage of recurrent points that appear in sequence, forming diagonal
line structures in the distance matrix. DET corresponds to the amount of patches of recurrent behavior in the studied
series, i.e., to portions of the state space in which the system resides for a time longer than expected by chance alone
(see [24,25]). This is a very crucial point: a recurrence can, in principle, be observed by chance whenever the system
explores two nearby points of its state space. On the contrary, the observation of recurrent points consecutive in time
(and then forming lines parallel to the main diagonal) is an important signature of deterministic structuring [5,26].
The superposition between determinism and Lyapunov exponents is a proof of this point [5]. ENT = entropy, which
is deﬁned in terms of the Shannon-Weaver formula for information entropy [7,27] computed over the distribution of
length of the lines of recurrent points and measures the richness of deterministic structuring of the series. LYAP
is simply the length (in terms of consecutive points) of the longest recurrent line in the plot. LYAP was found to
accurately predict (r = 0.93) the value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent in a logistic map going from a regular to
chaotic regime [8]. Finally, TREND is the regression coeﬃcient of the relation between time (in terms of distance from
the main diagonal) and the amount of recurrence. TREND quantiﬁes the fading away of recurrence going forward in
time, and represents a measure of stationarity [7].

All RQA descriptors were computed for both the LJ ﬂuid and the protein MD potential energy time series. In
particular, for the ﬂuid, data from a simulation at T = 0.8 (usual reduced unit) were used. To test for the null
hypothesis that the MD series are stochastic, the original trajectories were randomly shuﬄed to obtain 30 copies of
each series (Table I). The 95% conﬁdence intervals for the RQA descriptors were computed, and the position of the
original series relative to the conﬁdence intervals checked. Except for REC (and here it is noted that the value for the
MD simulation falls within the range of obtained shuﬄings), the null hypothesis for LJ ﬂuid could not be rejected,
pointing to the stochastic character of the ﬂuid simulation. For the protein MD, however, the RQA values were well
beyond the conﬁdence limits of the shuﬄed series, thus demonstrating the presence of strong “phase information” for
the protein dynamics.

IV. RESULTS

V. DISCUSSION

A relevant portion of the theoretical work on MD was based upon LJ ﬂuid simulations performed by Rahman [28].
These trajectories can be deﬁned as recurrent, Hamiltonian, mixing and K-ﬂow, or following some authors, “Lyapunov
unstable.” [29]. The simulated LJ system evolves toward an equilibrium state, and the constant energy surface deﬁned
by the initial conditions is accessible to the system itself. The motion of such a system is at least mixing so as to
sample all the explored surface.

In the case of the LJ ﬂuid, the result obtained, in Eckmann, Kamphorst, and Ruelle terms [5], can be deﬁned
as “autonomous,” i.e., typical of a system evolving following time independent equations: this corresponds to our
operational deﬁnition of a “shuﬄing resistant” potential energy time series.
In fact, the RQA parameters of the
shuﬄed series are not statistically diﬀerent from the original series. This behavior corresponds to a random-like
sampling of the phase space of the system, even if the sampling is driven by a deterministic “engine” such as MD.
These kinds of “experiments” were used by Verlet [11,30] to compute thermodynamic properties of ﬂuids following a
formalization introduced by Birkhoﬀ [31,32], and based on Boltzmann’s view of ergodicity assumptions.

The recurrence plot of the protein simulation (Fig. 1) immediately shows the impossibility of direct averaging of the
data. The simple visual inspection of the plot highlights abrupt changes in the texture pointing to multiple minima
in the trajectory (rugged landscape as opposed to ﬂat surface). This point is underscored in Fig. 3, which depicts
REC and DET in a windowed series. REC presents as a rugged landscape, while DET displays several discontinu-
ities. More importantly, the shuﬄing procedure signiﬁcantly alters the numerical values of the RQA descriptors, thus

3

demonstrating the “shuﬄing sensitivity” of the underlying trajectory. The “ergodic” constraints of complete accessi-
bility and mixing are not suﬃcient to make the system evolve to an equilibrium situation given the ﬁnite time of the
simulation, and as a result, the trajectory is trapped in a limited portion of the energy surface. In such situations we
can speak of metastable states [33,34], which obviate the possibility of computing direct averages. In order to compute
physical measures on such simulations, the local minima of the phase space must be revealed and their relative depth
estimated.

The thermalization algorithms used in MD are not guaranteed to preserve the microcanonic properties of the system
[19]; nevertheless, we think that the quantitative RQA parameters can be correlated to the thermodynamic properties
of the system under investigation. In any case, these parameters allow us to derive some useful information about
the shape of the energy landscape of the simulation. As a matter of fact, the basic algorithm of recurrence plots was
built by Eckmann and Ruelle [35] with the aim of reconstructing the dynamics relative to a time series in a ﬁnite
dimensional space, and of generating a tangent map of the reconstructed dynamics in order to calculate Lyapunov
exponents.

In the recurrence plot, a recurrence is scored (and the respective point darkened) whenever |xj − xi| < d. We can
think of this inequality as the numerator of the incremental ratio, dy/dx, where dx corresponds to the time interval
between two sampled points in phase space. Thus the recurrent points are corresponding segments of the trajectory
going through valleys of the multidimensional space on which the potential energy is projected by the embedding
procedure. These valleys have, by deﬁnition, a low slope (d) (and thus they are recurrent in phase space). On a more
general note, the global texture of the plot is linked to the ruggedness of the explored landscape. A dense texture is
linked to smooth slopes and a ﬂat landscape, while a coarse texture points to steeper energetic barriers with the lack
of texture (no recurrent points at all) revealing transitions. This qualitative picture is consistent with the analysis of
the logistic map by RQA [8] where the phase transitions of the system (changes in dynamical regime) were registered
by the RQA parameters.

Looking at the recurrence plot of the LJ ﬂuid (Fig. 2) the loss of any preferential directionality of the system
(quantitatively proved by the shuﬄing invariance) is clear. REC (Fig. 4) is considerably smoother compared to Fig.
3, while DET is erratic, reﬂective of the very low recurrence values. The directionality of Fig. 2 is highlighted when
it is compared with the plot relative to the annealing phase of a tripeptide (Fig. 5) (see [4]) where the directionality
was imposed by a strong order parameter; i.e., decrease of temperature. The protein recurrence plot (Fig. 1) has
a preferential directionality in time (shuﬄing sensitivity) that allows us to appreciate the eﬀective dimensionality of
the explored conformational space. With an adequate sampling time we can resolve both the Frauenfelder substates
[10,36] in terms of large scale typology of the plot (Figs. 6–7) and the features of the single substate in terms of
texture (Fig. 8).

In summary RQA seems to constitute a very promising tool for the characterization of conformational substates in

MD simulations.

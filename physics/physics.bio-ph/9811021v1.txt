Evolution in time-dependent ﬁtness landscapes

Claus O. Wilke∗

Abstract

Evolution in changing environments is an important, but little studied aspect of
the theory of evolution. The idea of adaptive walks in ﬁtness landscapes has triggered
a vast amount of research and has led to many important insights about the progress
of evolution. Nevertheless, the small step to time-dependent ﬁtness landscapes has
most of the time not been taken. In this work, some elements of a theory of adaptive
walks on changing ﬁtness landscapes are proposed, and are subsequently applied to
and tested on a simple family of time-dependent ﬁtness landscapes, the oscillating N K
landscapes, also introduced here. For these landscapes, the parameter governing the
evolutionary dynamics is the fraction of static ﬁtness contributions fS. For small fS,
local optima are virtually non-existent, and the adaptive walk constantly encounters
new genotypes, whereas for large fS, the evolutionary dynamics reduces to the one
on static ﬁtness landscapes. Evidence is presented that the transition between the
two regimes is a 2nd order phase transition akin a percolation transition. For fS
close to the critical point, a rich dynamics can be observed. The adaptive walk gets
trapped in noisy limit cycles, and transitions from one noisy limit cycle to another
occur sporadically.

Introduction

The key element of Darwinian evolution is natural selection, which prefers advantageous
mutations and rejects deleterious ones. It is possible to separate any evolutionary system
under study into two components: a single species (or population of individuals) and
an environment. The individuals in the population change because of mutations, and
the environment discriminates between better adapted ones (the ones generating more
oﬀspring, i.e., the “ﬁtter” ones) and worse adapted ones. The diﬀerence in the number of
oﬀspring suﬃces to remove eﬃciently the worse adapted individuals from the population.
Clearly, the environment does not necessarily remain constant in time. It consists of all the
inﬂuences acting on the species, and it therefore contains a-biotic and biotic components.
Changes may have an a-biotic origin (e.g., change in mean temperature, change in sea
level) or a biotic origin (e.g., other species in the same ecosystem changing because of
adaption). The latter case is usually referred to as coevolution. From the viewpoint of
a single species that adapts in an environment, all evolutionary scenarios can be divided
into three distinct classes.

These classes are, as depicted in Fig. 1, i) evolution in a constant environment, ii)
evolution in a variable environment without feedback to the environment, and iii) evo-
lution with feedback to the environment. The last class is the coevolutionary case men-
tioned above. The current knowledge about evolutionary dynamics is very unevenly dis-
tributed over these three classes. An overwhelming amount of theoretical results is known

for class i). Most of the work in
the ﬁeld of population genetics has
been done with constant environment
[6, 9, 17]), and also the idea
(e.g.
of adaptive walks in ﬁtness land-
scapes,
introduced by Wright [27],
and intensively studied for example
by Kauﬀman [14], has usually only
been applied to constant ﬁtness land-
scapes. Class iii) has also been stud-
ied intensively. One the one hand,
there exists a rich theoretical ecol-
ogy literature (e.g.
[8, 11]), dealing
with predator-prey interactions such
as Lotka-Volterra systems, or with
host-parasite interactions. On the
other hand, over the last decade, co-
evolutionary scenarios have been stud-
ied through direct competition of two
or more species in Artiﬁcial Life style
computer simulations (e.g.
[12, 15,
22]). The evolutionary patterns ob-
served there are often very complex,
and a clear theoretical understanding
of these patterns has not been ob-
tained yet. Finally, Class ii), which
lies between classes i) and iii), and
which could therefore yield many new
insights about the connection between adaptive walks and coevolution, has nevertheless
widely been neglected. There exists some work on evolution in randomly ﬂuctuating
environments[10], but this work obviously cannot cover the wide range of possible sce-
narios within class ii).
In particular, a theory for the natural generalization of class i)
adaptive walks, i.e., adaptive walks on a changing ﬁtness landscape, is still missing.

vided into three classes: i) evolution in a con-
stant environment, ii) evolution in a variable
environment without feedback, and iii) evo-
lution with feedback to the environment.

2 Environmentally guided drift

Evolutionary processes in static ﬁtness landscapes tend to get stuck quickly in local optima,
often far away from some globally optimal solution. This hinders evolution’s progress, and
severely restricts the amount of possible solutions that can be found during the adaptive
progress. Nevertheless, Nature’s rich diversity of extremely clever solutions to a large
array of diﬀerent problems indicates that some mechanisms are driving evolution out of
local optima. Probably, the most common proposal for such a mechanism is the idea
of neutral evolution, introduced by Kimura [17], and based on the observation that the
genotype-phenotype mapping of living beings discards information. Certain mutations can
appear without change in the organism’s ﬁtness, and therefore, without being constrained
by natural selection. The accumulation of such neutral mutations is called neutral drift.
In principle, the neutral drift could allow a certain gene to drift far away from its original
position in genome space, and then to change to a very much advantageous state by

IR-INI 98–09, c(cid:13) 1998 Institut f¨ur Neuroinformatik, Ruhr-Universit¨at Bochum, FRG 3

means of a single point mutation. There exists a lot of interesting theoretical results on
this topic [7, 13, 20, 21]. However, on the level of proteins, there is not much evidence in
favor of this viewpoint [2, 19]. Clearly, there are neutral mutations on the level of DNA
(diﬀerent codons code for the same amino acid) or in the RNA folding problem, but on the
level of amino acid sequences almost every change seems to have some selective impact.

One out of the numerous investigations demonstrating the absence of neutrality on
the protein level is the following study of the Fast/Slow (Adh-F/Adh-S ) polymorphism at
the alcohol dehydrogenase locus (Adh) of Drosophila melanogaster. The Fast/Slow poly-
morphism is probably the most intensively studied polymorphism at all, with a number
of 364 scientiﬁc research papers written on it already back in 1988 [4]. Kreitman [18] se-
quenced eleven cloned Drosophila m. Adh genes from ﬁve natural populations. Forty-two
out of 43 diﬀerences in the DNA sequence were silent, only one base-pair substitution
actually caused a change in the amino acid sequence. This base-pair substitution consti-
tuted exactly the Adh-F/Adh-S polymorphism. The immediate conclusion that could be
drawn was that most amino acid changes in alcohol dehydrogenase would be selectively
deleterious for the wild-type Drosophila m. Other studies demonstrate that the Fast/Slow
polymorphism in itself is sensitive to some selective pressure. The population’s compo-
sition of Adh-F and Adh-S mutants was found to change with the geographical latitude
(latitudinal cline) [24, 26]. In a recent study, Berry and Kreitman [3] found a cline along
the East Coast of North America that could only be observed in the amino acid respon-
sible for the Adh-F/Adh-S polymorphism, but not in the accompanying silent mutations.
This ﬁnding rejects neutral drift as the origin of the cline.

Comprehensive reviews on the subject of protein evolution’s sensitivity to selective

pressures can be found in [2, 19].

Another mechanism capable of driving evolution away from local optima is a slowly
changing environment, as proposed by Benner and Ellington [2]. If most changes in the
amino acid sequence of a certain protein are not selectively neutral, then, on the other
side, most changes in the selective force will have some impact on the amino acid sequence
of this protein. A slowly changing environment will then (on an evolutionary time scale)
drag genes around in genotype space. This results in another form of genetic drift, which
can happen under complete absence of neutrality. However, this drift is not a diﬀusion
process such as neutral drift. Instead, if the environmental changes happen slowly, the
population as a whole will move through the genotype space, since transitions to a se-
lectively advantageous state happen very fast, as ﬁrst order phase transitions [1]. Such
environmental inﬂuences on the evolutionary dynamics have rarely been considered, and
the kind of dynamics they will produce is not at all understood. In the reminder of this
paper, we will investigate the inﬂuence of a slowly changing environment for a simple
example of a time-dependent ﬁtness landscape. Note that we will only be interested in
environmental changes happening on time-scales much larger than the population’s typical
transition times to states with higher ﬁtness. Therefore, we can restrict our investigations
to the study of adaptive walks [14]. But, before we embark upon this endeavor, we have
to deﬁne some useful notions.

First of all, we are going to deﬁne the concept of environmentally guided drift of a
gene. This concept will be useful in the further study of evolution in time-dependent
ﬁtness landscapes.

Deﬁnition 1 (Environmentally guided drift) A gene is said to drift environmentally
guided if in every jump from one point in genotype space to another, the gene’s ﬁtness in
this time step remains either constant or increases.

4

This deﬁnition includes neutral drift as a special case, and it also includes those adaptive
walks in which transitions to lower ﬁtnesses are forbidden. Note that the ﬁtness can nev-
ertheless decrease during environmentally guided drift because of environmental changes.
However, this decrease is completely due to a change in the structure of the underlying
ﬁtness landscape, and not to a movement in the ﬁtness landscape.

Neutral drift has been included in the Deﬁnition 1 to make the term environmentally
guided drift suﬃciently general. However, our main interest in this paper lies in ﬁtness
landscapes that do not contain any neutrality.

Deﬁnition 1 reads very much like the deﬁnition of standard hill-climbing, and is of
course nothing else in essence. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to introduce a new
notion to remind ourselves that the dynamics changes drastically in a time-dependent
ﬁtness landscape. In particular, a gene may appear to be in a local optimum for almost
every single time step, and nonetheless it may travel constantly due to the changing
positions of the local optima.

As in the case of pure neutral drift, the environmentally guided drift could allow a gene
to arrive at a point in genotype space that would not have been accessible by means of
simple hill-climbing on a ﬁxed ﬁtness landscape. Since environmental changes are often os-
cillatory (seasons, for example, happen on an evolutionary time scale for microorganisms)
or pseudo-oscillatory (for example, cf. Fig. 2 in [23]), a species most likely encounters the
same environmental state several times, and can use the intermediate times of environ-
mental guided drift for further adaption.

3 Environmentally linked networks

An important ingredient of the neutral theory of evolution is the notion of neutral net-
works. A neutral network is formed by points in the genotype space that have identical
ﬁtnesses and that are connected by elementary mutations. The neutral drift is a diﬀu-
sion process over these networks. In analogy to the situation of neutral evolution, we can
deﬁne structures on which the environmentally guided drift naturally takes place. These
structures will in the following be called environmentally linked networks or short EL
networks.

EL networks can be deﬁned on any time-dependent ﬁtness landscape that has identical
states, i.e., on ﬁtness landscapes for which there exists a sequence of times t0, t1, t2, . . . ,
such that

F(t0) = F(t1) = F(t2) = . . . ,

(1)

where F(t) = F(t′) means that all points in genotype space have the same ﬁtness at times
t and t′.

Deﬁnition 2 (Environmentally linked networks) An environmentally linked net-
work is the set of all those points in the genotype space that can be reached by means
of environmentally guided drift at times ti, for which F(t0) = F(ti), starting from some
ﬁxed genome at time t0.

The EL networks according to Deﬁnition 2 contain all the points in the genotype
space that can in principle be reached by sole hill-climbing. The probability to reach
some of these points may be very low. Therefore, these points will most certainly never
be encountered. As a consequence, EL networks are too “large” for practical purposes,

IR-INI 98–09, c(cid:13) 1998 Institut f¨ur Neuroinformatik, Ruhr-Universit¨at Bochum, FRG 5

they contain many points with no relevance for the evolutionary dynamics. To resolve this
problem, we deﬁne smaller structures, in which the most unlikely points are removed.

Deﬁnition 3 (ǫ-environmentally linked networks) The set of all the points xi in an
EL network for which a sequence of points x0, x1, . . . , xi−1, xi in the EL network exists,
such that every transition from xj−1 to xj can occur with probability ǫtj −tj−1, is called an
ǫ-environmentally linked network.

This deﬁnition immediately gives a trivial upper bound to the number of points nt that
can belong to the ǫ-EL network after t evolution time steps:

nt ≤

1
ǫt .
A question that arises in conjunction with the above deﬁnitions is whether environmen-
tally guided drift can produce, in absence of neutrality, analogues of percolating neutral
networks, i.e., EL networks whose points are close in Hamming-distance to any arbitrary
point in the genotype space. The existence, or non-existence, of percolating networks
determines whether a mechanism is eﬃcient in generating evolutionary innovation.

4 Oscillating N K-models

Environmental changes can be modelled in many diﬀerent ways. For example, the ﬂuctu-
ations can be stochastic or deterministic, continuous or discontinuous, spatially resolved
or unresolved. Clearly, each of the diﬀerent possibilities has its reason of being. Gille-
spie has studied the eﬀects of selection in a randomly ﬂuctuating environment [10]. In
his models, the ﬂuctuations’ time scale is comparable to the duration of one generation
of the organisms considered. As a result, the genotype with the largest geometric mean
ﬁtness dominates the population, and ultimately wins over all competing genotypes. In
the present work, we are interested in a diﬀerent situation. The subject of this work are
environmental changes that happen so slowly that the population as a whole moves to a
more advantageous genotype once it is discovered. In this situation, a randomly ﬂuctu-
ating environment does not seem to be appropriate. Rather, we are going to consider a
continuous, deterministic model. For reasons of simplicity, we will also neglect any spatial
structure. A changing environment of this kind can easily be included into the well-known
N K family of ﬁtness landscapes [14, 16], standard landscapes commonly used for the
study of adaptive walks. An N K-landscape is a ﬁtness landscape for a bitstring of N bits.
The ﬁtness of a bitstring is the average over the ﬁtness contributions of all bits in the
string. The contribution of a single bit depends on its state and on the state of K other
bits interacting with it. Mathematically, we can write the ﬁtness f as:

f =

fi(Si, Sαi1 , · · · , SαiK ) ,

1
N

N

Xi=1

where Si is the state of the ith bit (zero or one), αij is the number of the jth bit interacting
with bit i, and fi(·) is a function that maps the state of the ith bit and its interacting
bits onto a real number between 0 and 1. In the following, we will write the state of the
K + 1 bits Si, Sαi1 , · · · , SαiK as {S}i. Usually, the functions fi({S}i) are realized as tables
containing a diﬀerent ﬁtness contribution Cα for every possible arrangement of bits:

fi({S}i) = Ci,{S}i .

(6)

A straightforward generalization of this concept is reached by making the functions
fi({S}i) time dependent. Instead of the constants on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) we
then have to use time-dependent functions:

fi({S}i, t) = Fi,{S}i(t) .

The functions Fi,{S}i(t) could in principle be arbitrarily complicated. Here, we are going
to consider a simple trigonometric time dependency, i.e.,

Fi,{S}i(t) =

[sin(ωi,{S}it + δi,{S}i) + 1] .

1
2

This introduces only a single additional constant per ﬁtness contribution, since there are
now two of them (the frequency ωi,{S}i, and the phase δi,{S}i). The frequencies ωα and the
phases δα are chosen randomly at the beginning of the evolutionary process, and then kept
ﬁxed for all times t. The phases have to be distributed uniformly in the interval [0; 2π)
if the resulting ﬁtness landscape is supposed to be homogeneous in time. The choice of
the frequencies determines whether the ﬁtness landscape is periodic in time. If we set the
frequencies to ωi,{S}i = 2πni,{S}i/T , with ni,{S}i being integral, and T being arbitrary,
but the same for all ωi,{S}i), we obtain a periodic ﬁtness landscape with oscillation period
T . Throughout the rest of this paper, we will stick to this choice. Its advantage rests in
the easy comparison of a bistring’s evolution in diﬀerent oscillation periods.

If we set a frequency ωi,{S}i to zero, the according ﬁtness contribution Fi,{S}i(t) is
constant in time. The fraction of these non-oscillatory (static) ﬁtness contributions will
be called fS in the following. The quantity fS is the total number of static ﬁtness con-
tributions, divided by the total number of all ﬁtness contributions. Adaptive walks on
oscillating N K-landscapes show several distinct classes of behavior, most strongly inﬂu-
enced by fS.

4.1 Numerical experiments

We have done several numerical experiments with oscillating N K-landscapes. In all sim-
ulations presented below, only one oscillating mode was used. This means, all frequencies
ωi were set either to zero or to some ﬁxed value ω. If not indicated otherwise, the value
ω = 2π/200 was used. In Figures 2-4 some typical runs of adaptive walks in oscillating
N K-landscapes are presented. The adaptive walk was performed exactly as in Kauﬀman’s
original work: a random point mutation was accepted if it increased the bitstring’s ﬁt-
ness. Otherwise, the mutation was rejected. Hence, the adaptive walk per deﬁnition took
place on an EL network. Fig. 2 shows an example of the evolutionary dynamics with a
relatively low fraction of static ﬁtness contributions. The resulting pattern is a chaotically
changing ﬁtness. With almost every accepted mutation, a new genotype is encountered.
The environmentally guided drift resembles a random walk on the ﬁtness landscape. In-
terestingly, this is the case even for small K. N K-landscapes with small K are highly
correlated, which should bias the adaptive walk. Nevertheless, it seems the oscillations
destroy the correlations’ eﬀect. The picture changes drastically with increasing fS. The
higher amount of static ﬁtness contributions reduces the number of possible advantageous
mutations in every time step. The sites connected to static contributions freeze out in
a locally optimal state, and only the sites connected to oscillating contributions can still
change. Hence, the dynamics gets conﬁned in a small region of the genotype space. The
same mutational patterns are seen over and over again in the diﬀerent oscillation periods.

IR-INI 98–09, c(cid:13) 1998 Institut f¨ur Neuroinformatik, Ruhr-Universit¨at Bochum, FRG 7

In the ﬁtness plots, we can identify this behavior with a periodic or almost periodic change
of the ﬁtness, as shown in Fig. 3. Using the language of dynamic systems, we can say
that the attractor of an adaptive walk on an oscillating landscape with intermediate fS is
a limit cycle. Since the dynamics we are investigating here is not deterministic, the limit
cycles we observe will generally be noisy. Hence, the limit cycles have to be understood
in the sense of the ǫ-EL networks deﬁned above. With a certain small probability p < ǫ,
the process can leave an attractor, and ﬁnd a new one. A transition from one attractor to
another is shown in Fig. 4. In this case, the mean ﬁtness has signiﬁcantly increased after
the transition.

A detailed analysis of the transition in Fig. 4 reveals the typical behavior of noisy limit
cycles in oscillating N K-models. We begin our analysis at time t = 6000. The dynamics
proceeded as follows. Underlined bits have been mutated in the corresponding time step.

We ﬁnd a limit cycle with two states. At the beginning of each period, bit 5 is switched
from 0 to 1. Towards the end of the period, the bit is switched back to 0. Remember
we used T = 200 in this run, hence oscillation periods started at t = 6000, 6200, 6400, . . ..
The exact times in which bit 5 was switched diﬀer from period to period, because of the
nondeterministic dynamics. Further 33 mutations occurred in bit 5 until a mutation in
bit 4 in time-step t = 10110 generated a rapid movement towards a far away region in the
genotype space:

Further 40 mutations occurred between t = 10114 and t = 11301, until ﬁnally, in t = 11302,
a new stable conﬁguration was found:

This time, the dynamics had found a stable ﬁx point. No further mutations occurred until
the simulation was aborted in time-step t = 40000.

At this point, it is interesting to ask whether all limit cycles will be left for t → ∞,
or whether the dynamics inevitably encounters a stable limit cycle eventually. A possible
answer to this question will be given in Sec. 4.3, where we present evidence for the existence
of a percolation transition in the region of intermediate fS. For fS above the critical value,
the dynamics would sooner or later reach a stable ﬁxed point, or a stable limit cycle,
whereas for fS below the critical value, every limit cycle which is part of the inﬁnite (in
the limit N → ∞) EL network will be eventually left.

4.2 Short oscillation periods

The oscillation period used in the previous section was relatively long, if compared to
the length N of the bitstring. In such a situation, a single site can be hit repeatedly by
mutations during one oscillation period. This generates complicated time correlations,
which are hard to tackle theoretically. The correlations can be neglected in situations in
which every site is, on average, hit at most once during one oscillation period. This is
assured if the number of time-steps T in one oscillation period is small compared to the
number of bits N in the string,

T ≪ N .

The case fS = 0 can be treated analytically in this regime. Again, we consider only a single
frequency ω, i.e., ωi = ω for all i. Let us begin with a bitstring of N bits without epistatic
interactions, i.e., with K = 0. In this case, the mutation of a single bit will change a single
ﬁtness contribution fi(t) to a new form f ′
i(t). With what probability will the new ﬁtness
contribution exceed the old one at time t? Since both fi(t) and f ′
i(t) can be considered
being chosen randomly from a large set of possible functions, the probability equals the
fraction of the interval [0; T ) in which the function f ′
i(t) exceeds the function fi(t). This
i(t∗):
fraction is easily calculated. We compute the intersecting points t∗

Hence, f ′
i(t) will exceed fi(t) half of the period, and will be smaller than fi(t) during the
other half. Therefore, the probability pclimb, with which a random mutation will lead to a
higher ﬁtness, is pclimb = 1/2. The resulting bitstring’s motion in the genotype space is a
random walk, in which jumps to neighboring positions occur only with probability 1/2.

The above result can easily be extended to higher K. The probability 1/2 actually
stems from the symmetry that the ﬁtness contributions possess as trigonometric functions:

fi(t + T /2) − 1/2 = −

fi(t) − 1/2

i(t) > fi(t) follows f ′

With Eq. (12), from f ′
i(t + T /2) < fi(t + T /2). Half of the interval is
dominated by fi(t), the other half by f ′
i(t). A similar equation exists for the case K > 0.
For positive K, a single mutation aﬀects the ﬁtness contributions of K + 1 bits. K + 1
ﬁtness contributions change. Without loss of generality, assume they are numbered from
1 to K + 1. Then, a mutation is accepted if the sum of the changed ﬁtness contributions
exceeds the sum of the original ﬁtness contributions, i.e., if

which is the exact equivalent of Eq. (12) for positive K. Thus, for a given set of ﬁtness
contributions fj(t), f ′

dominate half of the interval [0; T ), and it will be dominated on the other half. Clearly, in

K = 0. Therefore, the dynamics for fS = 0 and T ≪ N is a random walk, independent of
the choice of K. For all K, the probability that the next step in the random walk is taken
is 1/2.

We have tested our analytical results in numerical experiments. The adaptive walk
behaves indeed very similar to a random walk for fS = 0. In Fig. 5, we have displayed
the trajectories generated during the ﬁrst 1000 time-steps in 4 diﬀerent computer experi-
ments. Since it is hard to visualize a high-dimensional trajectory, we plotted the Hamming
distance dH between the bitstring at time t and the bitstring at time 0. Three of the ex-
periments were done with oscillating N K-models, the forth one was a simple random
walk, used as a comparison.
In all 3 experiments with oscillating landscapes, we used
T = N/2 = 50. The qualitative behavior is very similar in all 4 plots. In all cases, the

walker quickly moves away from the initial position in genome space. For the rest of the
run, the walker’s Hamming distance from the initial position ﬂuctuates about dH = 50.
This is to be expected for a random walk with N = 100. On average, in two randomly
chosen sequences, half of the bits are the same. Therefore, dH ﬂuctuates about N/2.

Some more insight can be gained from a direct measurement of pclimb for diﬀerent
period lengths T . The result of such a measurement is presented in Fig 6. For small T ,
pclimb forms a plateau around 0.5, as it was predicted by our analysis above. For large
times T , the probability pclimb decays to zero.

4.3 EL networks and the percolation transition

In this section, we will study the question of the existence of a percolating regime for
small fS. In the following, we will only be interested in EL networks, i.e., we observe the
dynamics only at the beginning of each oscillation period, and disregard what is going
on in intermediate times. We will say an EL network percolates if it consists of inﬁnitely
many points. This deﬁnition is similar to the usual deﬁnition of the percolating cluster
on the Bethe lattice, and is the appropriate way to deﬁne percolation in high-dimensional
spaces [25]. Clearly, it can be applied literally only in the limit N → ∞. However, the
genotype space grows so fast with increasing N that this restriction can be neglected.

The study of EL networks in oscillating N K landscapes is computationally very de-
manding, since we have to go through the full oscillation periods in the simulation. Hence,
we restrict ourselves to a single case we study as an example. We use ωi = ω = 2π/T with
T = 200, as we have done in the previous sections. Moreover, we consider only the case
N = 20.

Figure 7 shows the fraction γ of new genotypes among all the genotypes encountered at
the beginning of each oscillation period. This is a measure for the size of an EL network.

Figure 7: The fraction of newly encountered genotypes at the beginning of each oscillation
period in oscillating ﬁtness landscapes. For small fS, a new genotype is encountered in
almost every adaptive move. With increasing fS, the fraction of new genotypes decreases
to zero. This happens the faster the larger the value of K.

A value near 1 means a new genotype has been encountered in almost every oscillation
period. On the other hand, a value near 0 means the network’s size is small, thus conﬁning
the adaptive walk in a limited region of the genotype space.
In the limit of inﬁnitely
many oscillation periods, only percolating networks can have a positive γ, whereas ﬁnite
networks yield γ = 0. Therefore, γ is a proper order parameter to indicate a percolation
transition. Clearly, in numerical experiments the number of oscillation periods over which
the measurement is taken is ﬁnite, and therefore we will observe a positive γ even in the
non-percolating regime. In the case of Fig. 7, for example, the value γ was obtained from
averaging over 60 adaptive walks, each on a diﬀerent ﬁtness landscape. Every adaptive
walk endured 200 oscillation periods. The error bars present the standard deviations of
the single measurements.

Let us begin the discussion of Fig. 7 with the two graphs in the bottom row, for K = 8
and K = 14. In both cases, γ = 1 for small fS, and γ = 0 for fS ≈ 1. The standard
deviations are very small in both limiting regimes. In the region about fS ≈ 0.5, a sharp
drop in γ can be observed, accompanied with an enormous increase in the error bars. The
large error bars are a sign for critical ﬂuctuations, which are observed in 2nd order phase
transitions. The picture is not as clear in the upper row of Fig. 7, for K = 0 and K = 2.
The error bars are large for the whole range of fS, and γ does not reach the value 1 for
fS = 0. This implies a percolating El network, if it exists for small K (below we will
give an argument why this is probably not the case for K = 0), does not span the whole
genotype space in this case, even in the limit fS = 0. The transition from the percolating
to the non-percolating regime has to be much softer, and the critical value f ∗
S cannot be
estimated from our measurements.

Measurements with an extremely increased accuracy are necessary to determine the

critical point f ∗
for small K. This work is currently being undertaken, and will be presented elsewhere.

S exactly, and to decide whether a percolation transition does exist at all

The measurements in Fig. 7 reveal another surprising fact. For small fS, γ is increased
with increased ruggedness of the landscape. The “Fujiyama” landscape K = 0 has a
much smaller γ than the relatively rugged landscape with K = 8. This means ruggedness
promotes the movement in the genotype space for the oscillating regime, a situation com-
pletely opposite to the case of ﬁxed ﬁtness landscapes, where ruggedness is regarded as an
impediment to the movement in the genotype space. We can understand this observation
in the “adiabatic” limit, where changes in the ﬁtness landscape happen so slowly that the
adaptive walk can always reach the next local optimum before another change happens. In
this limit, the EL network of the Fujiyama landscape degenerates to a single point. On the
other hand, the completely random Derrida landscape [5] which we obtain for K = N − 1
presents a multitude of local optima, and the changes in the ﬁtness landscape provide the
opportunity to hop from one local optimum to another in a random fashion during the
oscillation periods.

5 Conclusions

Evolution in a slowly changing environment follows a dynamics very diﬀerent from the
situation in a ﬁxed environment. Environmentally guided drift drives genes out of local
optima, and drags them around in the genotype space. The evolution generally proceeds on
ǫ-EL networks. However, transitions from one ǫ-EL network to another occur sporadically.
In this work, we have presented evidence for the existence of a giant ǫ-EL network in the
limit of a vanishing amount of static ﬁtness contributions. Consequently, in this limit the
whole genotype space can be transversed by means of environmentally guided drift. Hence,
the guided drift can provide – in absence of any neutral pathways in the ﬁtness landscape
– an eﬃcient mechanism to generate constantly new genotypes, albeit at every single point
in time the system seems to be trapped in a local optimum. In Sec. 4.3, we could show
that the eﬃciency of the environmentally guided drift is related to the ruggedness of the
landscape. A more rugged landscape provides more opportunities to move around under
environmental changes than a landscape with only a few peaks. Consequently, the rugged
landscapes observed in protein evolution [2] could accelerate protein evolution in an ever
changing environment, instead of hindering it.

Above the percolation transition, the ǫ-EL networks are relatively small. The dynamics
in this regime is dominated by noisy limit cycles. The system goes through several noisy
limit cycles until a stable limit cycle, or a stable ﬁxed point, is reached.

The model studied in the present paper, i.e., the family of oscillating N K-landscapes,
is certainly too simplistic to be accounted for as a realistic model of the evolution of a
species in a changing environment.
In particular, it can be argued whether oscillating
ﬁtness contributions, taking on all values between zero and one during one oscillation
period, are justiﬁed. Nevertheless, such a simple model can be used to get a ﬁrst impression
of how evolution in a slowly changing environment could behave. Furthermore, a simple
model can guide the development of tools and concepts that can then be applied to more
complicated situations. The idea of environmentally linked networks is such a concept.
EL networks can be deﬁned on any ﬁtness landscape with recurrent states. The restriction
to such ﬁtness landscapes may seem narrowing on the ﬁrst sight, but it is justiﬁed in a
number of reasonable situations, like the evolution of microorganisms under the change
of seasons, as mentioned in Sec. 2. Generally, two states of a system at diﬀerent points

IR-INI 98–09, c(cid:13) 1998 Institut f¨ur Neuroinformatik, Ruhr-Universit¨at Bochum, FRG 15

in time can only be compared under similar boundary conditions. Therefore, a condition
like Eq. (1) is necessary to draw meaningful comparisons. In particular, in evolution two
diﬀerent adaptive solutions can only be compared if the problem to solve is identical.

In future work, it should be interesting to study the percolation transition in more
detail, and to determine for what K a percolating regime actually exists. Furthermore,
higher oscillation modes should be considered and the inﬂuence of the string length N
and the period length T should be investigated. Investigations similar to the ones we have
presented in this work can also be done for other time-periodic ﬁtness landscapes.

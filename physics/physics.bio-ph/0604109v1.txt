Vitriﬁcation of aqueous cryoprotectant mixtures is essential in cryopreservation of proteins and
other biological samples. We report systematic measurements of critical cryoprotective agent (CPA)
concentrations required for vitriﬁcation during plunge cooling from T=295 K to T=77 K in liquid
nitrogen. Measurements on fourteen common CPAs including alcohols (glycerol, methanol, iso-
propanol), sugars (sucrose, xylitol, dextrose, trehalose), PEGs (ethylene glycol, PEG 200, PEG 2
000, PEG 20 000), glycols (DMSO, MPD), and salt (NaCl) were performed for volumes ranging
over four orders of magnitude from ∼ nL to 20 µL, and covering the range of interest in protein
crystallography. X-ray diﬀraction measurements on aqueous glycerol mixtures conﬁrm that the
polycrystalline-to-vitreous transition occurs within a span of less than 2% w/v in CPA concentra-
tion, and that the form of polycrystalline ice (hexagonal or cubic) depends on CPA concentration and
cooling rate. For most of the studied cryoprotectants, the critical concentration decreases strongly
with volume in the range from 5 µL to 0.1 µL, typically by a factor of two. By combining mea-
surements of the critical concentration versus volume with cooling time versus volume, we obtain
the function of greatest intrinsic physical interest: the critical CPA concentration versus cooling
rate during ﬂash cooling. These results provide a basis for more rational design of cryoprotective
protocols, and should yield insight into the physics of glass formation in aqueous mixtures.

INTRODUCTION

Cryocrystallographic methods play a central role in
protein crystallography (Hope, 1990; Rodgers, 1994;
Chayen et al., 1996; Garman and Schneider, 1997; Gar-
man, 1999; Juers and Matthews, 2004). The amount of
data that can be collected from a crystal before signiﬁ-
cant degradation in the X-ray beam occurs is increased
and, compared with room temperature data collection in
glass capillaries, crystal handling is in many ways simpli-
ﬁed. These large beneﬁts have accrued even though many
aspects of the cryoprotection and ﬂash cooling processes
have been poorly understood.

Protein crystals are mechanically very fragile. Because
they contain (and can be surrounded by) large amounts
of water, formation and growth of water ice crystals dur-
ing cooling degrades protein crystal order and diﬀraction
properties (Garman and Schneider, 1997). Instead, wa-
ter must be cooled into an amorphous, vitreous or glassy
state in which the liquid phase’s lack of long-range order
is preserved but its molecular motions are frozen out.

Glass formation during cooling occurs only if crystal
nucleation is somehow suppressed. Because of thermo-
dynamic and kinetic barriers, formation of crystal nuclei
requires a ﬁnite time, so higher cooling rates reduce the
probability of nucleation and favor glass formation. The
nucleation probability also depends on how liquid proper-

ties like viscosity vary with temperature, and thus on the
detailed form of the cooling path T(t). Cryoprotective
agents (CPAs) like glycerol, which dissolve in or fully mix
with water, modify molecular diﬀusion relevant to nucle-
ation. However, they can also lead to changes in protein
structure and, if introduced via post-growth soaks, can
cause osmotic shock and crystal damage, especially at
higher concentrations. The vitreous ice/polycrystalline
ice phase diagram as a function of cryoprotectant con-
centration thus provides an important tool for optimising
cryopreservation protocols.

is based on diﬀerential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) (MacKenzie, 1977). A
metal or glass container holding a solution volume of
∼ 10 − 100 µL is plunged into liquid nitrogen to cool
the solution into the vitreous state. Typical cooling
rates in DSC experiments are < 10 K/s, and the cooling
history determines the properties of the glassy state.
Calorimetry measurements are then performed as the
sample is warmed, typically at ∼ 1 K/s. For the slow
cooling rates typical of DSC, homogeneous crystal
nucleation occurs below a critical CPA concentration
Cm (Luyet and Rasmussen, 1968; Rasmussen and Luyet,
1970; Fahy et al., 1984). Above Cm, only heterogeneous
nucleation occurs, and this can be suppressed either
by using ”clean” samples or by reducing the sample
size. Homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation can
be distinguished by comparing the behavior of bulk
liquid, thin ﬁlms (Turnbull and Fisher, 1949), and
emulsions (Luyet and Rasmussen, 1968; Rasmussen and

Luyet, 1970). Cm thus determines the minimum CPA
concentration required to achieve vitriﬁed ice under
slow-cooling conditions. In protein crystallography, sam-
ple volumes range from µL to pL - orders of magnitude
smaller than in DSC measurements. The cooling rates
therefore are much larger, so the CPA concentrations
needed to achieve vitreous ice should be smaller.

To date, the kinetic phase diagrams giving the min-
imum (critical) CPA concentration required for vitri-
ﬁcation during plunge cooling in common liquid cryo-
gens have not been determined for any CPA in the vol-
ume/cooling rate range relevant to cryocrystallography.
In particular, the development of microfabricated mounts
(Thorne et al., 2003) as a replacement for loops in cry-
ocyrstallography has allowed very small crystals to be
routinely mounted with very little surrounding liquid,
and there is no information on CPA concentrations re-
quired for vitriﬁcation in such small volumes. Recent
experiments (Garman and Mitchell, 1996; McFerrin and
Snell, 2002; Chinte, et al., 2005) have probed the behav-
ior of larger volumes obtained by mixing glycerol with
Hampton crystallization screens, with 5% v/v glycerol
concentration increments. These screens contain multi-
ple components such as salts and other CPAs, and the
liquid volumes have not been accurately measured, mak-
ing detailed interpretation of results diﬃcult. Critical
CPA concentrations are of interest not just in protein
crystallography but more generally in cryopreservation
of biological samples. This suggests binary aqueous so-
lutions as the starting point for systematic study.

We have determined the vitreous ice/polycrystalline
ice phase diagrams of CPA concentration versus vol-
ume for plunge cooling in liquid nitrogen. We have ex-
amined volumes varying by up to ﬁve orders of mag-
nitude, from ∼ 1 nL (0.1 nL for glycerol) to 20 µL.
The measurements were done for fourteen diﬀerent pen-
etrating and nonpenetrating cryoprotectants, including
alcohols (glycerol, methanol, isopropanol), sugars (su-
crose, xylitol, dextrose, trehalose), polyethylene glycols
(PEGs) (ethylene glycol, PEG 200, PEG 2 000, PEG 20
000), glycols (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2-methyl-2,4-
pentanediol (MPD)), and salt (NaCl). Drops of solution
were plunge cooled from T=295 K into liquid nitrogen
at T=77 K. The resulting low temperature phase - vitre-
ous or polycrystalline - was determined from visual ob-
servation of whether the drops remained transparent or
became opaque, supplemented by X-ray diﬀraction mea-
surements. For the most common CPAs, the required
concentration is a strong function of volume, and for typi-
cal volumes relevant in protein crystallography is roughly
half that required for volumes greater than 10 µL. For
glycerol, we have also determined the critical concentra-
tion for vitriﬁcation versus cooling rate.

deionized (DI) water to produce aliquots in increments of
2% weight per volume (w/v). For solid CPAs, weighing
errors were less than 1%. For liquid CPAs, uncertainties
in dilution with DI water in volumetric ﬂasks were less
than 1%. To ensure full mixing for solid CPAs near their
solubility limits and for high viscosity liquid CPAs, the
solutions were heated, stirred and sonicated.

2.2. Drop dispensing, holding and volume
estimation

Four types of sample holder were used to accommodate
diﬀerent sample volumes: (1) 24 gauge (0.51 mm diame-
ter) copper loops with 1.6-1.7 mm diameters and (2) 36
gauge (0.13 mm diameter) tungsten loops with ∼0.9 mm
diameters were used for volumes of 7.5 µL to 20 µL and
100 nL to 7.5 µL, respectively; (3) CryoLoops (Hamp-
ton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) of 10 µm nylon with
nominal apertures of 0.1-0.5 mm were used for volumes
between 200 and 100 nL; and (4) MicroMounts (Mite-
gen, Ithaca, NY) made from 10 µm polyimide ﬁlms with
apertures of 100 to 500 µm were used for volumes smaller
than 100 nL. In all cases, experiments were performed to
verify that the sample holder did not limit cooling rates.
Larger volume drops were dispensed onto the metal
loops using a pipette (P2 and P20, Gilson, Pipetman,
Middleton, WI). As shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b), the re-
sulting drops were nearly spherical with very little liquid-
metal contact, and had radii slightly larger than the loop

radii. Small volume drops were prepared by immersing
CryoLoops or MicroMounts directly into CPA solutions.
CryoLoops yielded nearly spherical drops. The small-
est drops prepared using MicroMounts were ﬂattened in
the plane of the circular aperture, with aspect ratios of
roughly 0.3−0.4. To determine drop volumes captured by
CryoLoops and MicroMounts, the drops were treated as
oblate spheroids, and the dimensions of their axes mea-
sured using a microscope. The volume was calculated
as V = (4/3)πx2z, where x is the radius in the plane
of the aperture and z is half of the drop’s height. The
error in the volume was calculated using standard error
propagation based on the error in the dimensions of the
drops. Table I shows typical measured drop dimensions
and calculated volumes obtained for samples prepared
using MicroMounts.

2.3. Cooling and visual phase inspection

Flash cooling was performed by immersing samples in
liquid nitrogen (LN2) contained in a glass hemispherical
dewar (no.8130, Pope Scientiﬁc Inc, Saukville, WI). In
some experiments the nitrogen was cooled below its boil-
ing point by reducing the pressure above the LN2/vapor
interface. The dewar was sealed with an o-ring by a
transparent, 1 cm thick Plexiglass lid, and connected to a
vacuum pressure station equipped with a pressure gauge
(Barnat). After pumping, boiling in the open dewar was
eliminated. However, no appreciable diﬀerence in ﬂash
cooling results for boiling (T=77 K) and cooled LN2 was
observed, so most data was collected at T=77 K.

Drops were plunged by hand from room temperature
(T=295 K) into LN2 within a second after mounting,
to prevent any condensation or evaporation that could
change the sample composition and volume. The plunge
depth was ∼1-2 cm below the LN2 surface and the plunge
speed was ∼10 cm/s. To maximize heat transfer, drops
were agitated at ∼1 cm/s for several seconds until all
boiling had ceased. The boiling time for drop plus holder
ranged from a few seconds for the largest drops in copper
wire holders to a time shorter than could be resolved by
eye for the smallest drops in MicroMounts. Initially, boil-
ing involved nearly periodic evolution of single bubbles
2-3 mm in diameter. These bubbles were much larger
than the drop size and formed a ﬁlm around the drop
during their growth. We identify this as the ﬁlm-boiling
regime (Incropera and DeWitt, 1981; van Stralen and
Cole, 1979). Boiling behavior then showed an abrupt
and visually obvious transition to simultaneous evolution
of several small bubbles with sizes much smaller than
the drop size, which we identify as the bubble nucleation
regime. Each region produces characteristic sounds as
the bubbles break the LN2 surface, and the transition be-
tween them can easily be heard. For larger drop volumes
(> 0.5 µL) we were able to accurately measure the time
between immersion and this audible transition, which we
hereafter refer to as the boiling time tboil. Since the ﬁlm-
boiling regime lasted much longer than the bubble nu-
cleation regime, tboil gives a good estimate of the total
cooling time. Based on measurements of drops plunge-

3

cooled in thermocouples (Teng and Moﬀat, 1998), we es-
timate that the boiling time is roughly twice the time to
cool from room temperature to water’s glass transition
temperature Tg ∼140 K.

The drop opacity/transparency was ascertained by op-
tical observation through a stereo-microscope (Stereo-
Zoom 6, Bausch and Lomb, Rochester, NY) with ﬁber
optic illumination (Schott - Fostec). To facilitate obser-
vations, the solidiﬁed drop was raised to just below the
LN2 surface, and a black paper background inserted be-
hind it to enhance contrast.

2.4. X-ray diﬀraction measurements

X-ray diﬀraction was used to conﬁrm that

the
transparent/opaque
transition corresponded to the
glass/crystal transition, and to characterize the phase of
the smallest samples for which ascertaining transparency
was diﬃcult. Samples were ﬂash cooled in LN2 and
then mounted using CryoTongs (Hampton Research) (to
minimize the temperature rise during transfer) in a ni-
trogen gas cryo-stream at T=100 K. X-rays were pro-
duced by a Rigaku Rotaﬂex rotating anode X-ray gen-
erator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA, and detected
using a Rigaku R-Axis IV + + detector located 200 mm
away. Exposure times were one minute for 1◦ oscilla-
tions, and yielded a d-spacing resolution of less than 2
˚A. Raw X-ray images corresponding to amorphous or
polycrystalline states of the solidiﬁed drops were ana-
lyzed using HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) and
Datasqueeze (Datasqueeze Software, University of Penn-
sylvania, PA).

Diﬀraction patterns were acquired for glycerol-water
mixtures with drop volumes of 100 nL (in 0.5 mm Cry-
oLoops) and 200 pL (in 100 µm MicroMounts.) The
ﬁrst glycerol concentration tested was deep in the opaque
regime (22% w/v for 200 pL and 16% w/v for 100 nL),
and the concentration was then increased in 2% w/v in-
crements through the critical concentration and into the
transparent regime (30% w/v for 200 pL, and 58% w/v
for 100nL). Figure 2 shows typical diﬀraction image se-
quences at 100 nL and 200 pL, respectively.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Vitreous/polycrystalline phase diagrams and
critical

Visual observation in a microscope proved to be an
eﬃcient and reliable way to identify the vitreous-to-
polycrystalline ice transition. As shown in Figure 1, the
transition from transparent to opaque drops was dra-
matic and occurred without an intermediate ”cloudy”
phase. For a given CPA and drops of the same volume,
the drop-to-drop variation in CPA concentration at the
transition was less than 4% w/v, and variations presum-
ably reﬂected diﬀerences in drop shape and/or the details
of how it cooled.

For larger drops held in wire loops, as the CPA con-
centration was decreased through the transition region,
a patch of opaque ice ﬁrst formed in the region farthest
from the wire while the rest of the drop remained trans-
parent. This indicates that heat transfer through the
wire was more eﬃcient than directly from drop to nitro-
gen. The patch grew with decreasing CPA concentration
until it consumed the entire drop. The critical CPA con-
centration was determined as the smallest concentration
that did not yield a repeatable patch of opaque ice. Simi-
lar behavior was not observed for smaller drops mounted
in CryoLoops or MicroMounts.

Figure 3 shows the resulting data for the critical CPA
concentration required for vitriﬁcation versus drop vol-
ume, for volumes ranging from ∼3 nL to ∼30 µL. The 14
CPAs are grouped into ﬁve categories: alcohols (glyc-
erol, methanol,
isopropanol), sugars (sucrose, xylitol,
dextrose, trehalose), PEGs (ethylene glycol, PEG 200,
PEG 2 000, PEG 20 000), glycols (DMSO, MPD), and
salt (NaCl). Concentrations at and above the indi-
cated critical concentrations yielded transparent, vitre-
ous drops, while concentrations below yielded opaque,
polycrystalline drops.

Most of the studied cryoprotectants show three regimes
of behavior: a large volume (> 10µL) region where the
critical concentration is nearly constant; an intermediate
volume region where the critical concentration decreases
with decreasing volume; and a small volume (< 0.1µL)
region where the critical concentration again becomes
nearly constant. Table II gives the critical concentra-
tion of each CPA versus sample volume, and the ratio of
the critical concentrations in the large and small volume
regimes, respectively.

For NaCl, the solubility limit was reached before vit-
riﬁcation could be achieved at larger volumes. NaCl is
a particularly poor cryoprotectant, because it is eﬀective
only at small volumes and even then at concentrations
that are inhospitable to most proteins and cells. For
the PEGs, increasing the molecular weight extended the
large-volume region of nearly constant critical concentra-
tion to lower volumes, and PEG 20,000 did not show any
volume dependence between 0.1 µL to 20 µL.

3.2. Characterization of the vitreous
ice/polycrystalline ice transition by X-ray diﬀraction

X-ray diﬀraction was used to verify that the transpar-
ent/opaque optical transition indeed corresponds with
the vitreous ice / polycrystalline ice transition. Vitreous
ice (Dowell and Rinfret, 1960) produces a diﬀuse ring of
scattering near 3.7 ˚A, corresponding to the mean inter-
molecular spacing in the vitreous phase. Polycrystalline
hexagonal ice produces a sharp ring at 2.24 ˚A (110) and
a cluster of three rings ((100), (002), and (101)) with the
central ring at 3.7 ˚A (Dowell and Rinfret, 1960; Murray
et al., 2005; Kohl et al., 2000). In the following we refer
to the rings at 2.24 and 3.7 ˚A as α and β rings, respec-
tively. The (220) planes of cubic ice produce a ring at
2.24 ˚A, and the (111) planes produce one strong ring (as
opposed to 3 rings) at 3.7 ˚A. The number of rings at
the β ring spacing can thus be used to distinguish the

4

crystalline symmetry of the ice, provided that ﬁnite-size
broadening determined by the crystallite sizes is smaller
than the hexagonal ring spacing.

In previous studies, X-ray diﬀraction measurements of
the vitreous - polycrystalline transition used relatively
large (0.1-1 µL) and ill-deﬁned drop volumes (Garman
and Mitchell, 1996; McFerrin and Snell, 2002; Chinte
et al., 2005). We examined smaller volumes of 100 nL
and 200 pL, which correspond to the range of volumes
relevant to protein crystallography on ∼ 30 − 300 µm
crystals.

Figures 2 and 4 show a subset of a series of diﬀraction
patterns obtained as the glycerol concentration was in-
creased from zero and through the optically determined
critical concentration. For both 100 nL and 200 pL vol-
umes, the diﬀraction patterns of pure water showed scat-
tered spots at the α and β d-spacings of hexagonal ice,
indicating the presence of a ﬁnite number of relatively
large crystallites. When glycerol is added, these spots
become more numerous and eventually broaden into con-
tinuous rings, indicating an increase in the number of
randomly-oriented hexagonal crystallites and thus a de-
crease in their size. On further concentration increase,
the three hexagonal β rings are replaced by a single, much
more intense ring (inset c), indicating a phase change
from hexagonal to cubic ice (Dowell and Rinfret, 1960;
Murray et al., 2005; Kohl et al., 2000). Above a critical
glycerol concentration, the α ring disappears and the β
ring becomes broad and diﬀuse (insets b and a), indicat-
ing a transition to vitreous ice.

3.3. Cooling rate measurements

Figure 5 shows the boiling time tboil versus drop vol-
ume V for a 40% w/v glycerol solution, where tboil was
determined as the time after a drop was submerged that
the audible (and visual) transition from ﬁlm boiling to
nucleate boiling was observed, as discussed in Section
2.3. For moderate volumes the data are well described
by tboil ∼ V 1/2 (indicated by the solid line a), and for
large volumes by tboil ∼ V 2/3 (indicated by the solid line
b). Open circles show previous data obtained by directly
measuring the cooling time tc of 0.2 and 0.8 µL drops us-
ing a thermocouple (Teng and Moﬀat, 1998). They are
in good agreement with our data, conﬁrming the validity
of our measurements even at the shortest cooling times
we measured.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Behavior versus concentration near the critical
concentration

The simple method of optical observation (McFerrin
and Snell, 2002) proved remarkably eﬀective for vitre-
ous/polycrystalline phase identiﬁcation of CPA solutions
over the four-order-of-magnitude volume range explored.
This method gives an upper bound on the width of the
transition region between polycrystalline and vitreous

phases of < 4% w/v. X-ray measurements on 100 nL
glycerol-containing drops further narrow the span of this
transition region to less than 2% w/v, corresponding to
∼ 6% of the 32% critical concentration. The number of
water molecules per glycerol molecule thus changes from
11.7 at the resolved upper concentration limit of the poly-
crystalline phase to 10.8 at the resolved lower limit of the
vitreous phase, for the cooling rate achieved in the 100
nL drop.

4.2. Evolution of ice structure with cryoprotectant
concentration

The cubic crystalline form of ice is not observed dur-
ing slow cooling of water or water-glycerol solutions. For
pure water, cubic ice is formed by warming vitreous
ice above water’s glass transition temperature Tg. Usu-
ally cubic ice then converts to hexagonal ice at a higher
temperature, so there is a thermotropic (temperature-
dependent) cubic-to-hexagonal transition (Dowell and
Ringfret, 1960; Murray et al., 2005). In our experiments
we observe a robust lyotropic (concentration-dependent)
cubic-to-hexagonal transition, controlled by the glycerol
concentration. For both the 200 pL and 100 nL drops, the
cubic phase is achieved on ﬂash cooling over a wide glyc-
erol concentration range, suggesting that the cubic ice
phase is kinetically favored during ﬂash cooling and/or

that the presence of glycerol modiﬁes the preferred equi-
librium ice structure. A similar transition sequence from
vitreous to cubic to hexagonal ice during ﬂash cooling
has been observed as a function of sucrose concentration
(Lepault et al., 1997).

4.3. Volume dependence of the critical CPA
concentrations

For most CPAs in Figure 3, the measured variation of
the critical concentration C separating vitreous and poly-
crystalline phases with drop volume shows three regimes.
At large volumes and thus slow cooling rates, the critical
concentration for all CPAs is nearly constant. This is
consistent with C −→ Cm (Rasmussen and Luyet, 1970;
Fahy et al., 1984), where Cm is the minimum CPA con-
centration for which homogeneous crystal nucleation is
completely inhibited and the liquid phase cools directly
into the vitreous phase, regardless of cooling rate.

At intermediate volumes, the critical CPA concentra-
tion shows a sharp decrease with decreasing volume. The
cooling rate increases with decreasing volume, which re-
duces the time during which nucleation and growth of
crystalline ice can occur. For a given CPA concentra-
tion, the vitreous phase is kinetically favored beyond a
critical cooling rate. Recent measurements (Chinte et
al., 2005) on mixtures of glycerol and crystal screen so-

lutions placed in three sizes of CryoLoops (of decreasing
but ill-deﬁned volume) show a similar trend of decreas-
ing critical glycerol concentration with decreasing vol-
ume. An important exception to this general behavior is
provided by higher molecular weight PEGs, which show
little or no decrease in concentration with volume. The
large volume/slow cooling rate critical concentration Cm
in mg/mL ( monomers per unit volume) is roughly the
same for the various chain lengths, but the shorter chains
are more eﬀective in suppressing ice formation at smaller
volumes/larger cooling rates. This latter trend is consis-
tent with Garman’s observation for ∼ 0.2 − 1 µL drops
that smaller MW PEGs are more eﬀective cryoprotec-
tants (Garman and Mitchell, 1996).

However, for small volumes (< 0.1 µL) the critical con-
centration levels oﬀ and saturates, contrary to naive ex-
pectations that smaller volumes should cool faster. This
saturation could result either because i) the cooling rate
saturates, or ii) because a minimum amount of cryopro-
tectant is required to prevent crystalline ice formation,
regardless of the cooling rate.

The second of these hypotheses is inconsistent with
experiments showing that pure water can be vitriﬁed if
cooling rates are large enough (drop volumes are small
enough) (Angell, 2002). As will be discussed elsewhere,
to test the ﬁrst of these hypotheses, CPA-containing
drops were sprayed onto the bottom of small cups made
from ultra-thin copper foil, which were then immersed in
liquid nitrogen. Heat transfer from the drop then occurs
primarily via its contact with the copper rather than via
nitrogen vapor or liquid. For volumes of 0.1 − 10 µL,
the critical CPA concentrations measured in this way are
a few percent lower than those in Figure 3, but show
the same decrease with decreasing drop volume. How-
ever, unlike for drops directly plunged in liquid nitrogen,
no plateau is observed at small volumes.
Instead, the
behavior observed at intermediate volumes continues to
the smallest drops (1 pL) measured. This suggests that
a saturation in cooling rate is responsible for the small-
volume plateau in Figure 3.

4.4. Critical concentration and critical cooling rate
glass/crystal diagram

The measurements of the boiling time in Figure 5 can
be used to determine the cooling rate as a function of
drop volume. We deﬁne an average cooling rate q as
q = ∆T /tc, where ∆T = (295 − 77)K = 218K and tc
is the time to cool to T = 77K. Assuming tc ∼ tboil
and noting that ∆T in our experiments is constant, Fig-
ure 5 corresponds to a plot of the reciprocal cooling rate
q−1(V ).

By combining q(V ) obtained from Figure 5 with the
critical concentration C(V ) from Figure 3, we can elimi-
nate the volume V and obtain the minimum cryoprotec-
tant concentration to achieve vitriﬁcation as a function
of cooling rate, C(q). This is the function of greatest
intrinsic physical interest: C(V ) depends on the cooling
method (gas stream versus liquid plunge) and medium
(nitrogen, propane, ethane or helium), whereas C(q)
is nominally independent of these parameters and di-

6

rectly connects to the microscopic kinetics responsible
for glass formation. It can be used to determine the crit-
ical concentration for any cooling method, medium or
sample volume. To obtain this function, we use the ﬁts
tboil ∼ V 1/2 for 0 < V < 5 µL and tboil ∼ V 2/3 for
5 < V < 100 µL in Figure 5 and C ∼ Cm(1 − e−V a)b
for C(V ) in Figure 3. We exclude data from the small
volume saturation region.

This experimentally determined function for glycerol is
shown in Figure 6. The black circles represent our data
and the solid line is a guide to the eye. Below the line
the cooling rate and cryoprotectant concentration are too
small to eliminate homogeneous nucleation of crystal ice,
and above this line vitreous ice is obtained.

Figure 6 also shows previous data for the critical cool-
ing rates for water-glycerol mixtures reported by Sutton
(Sutton, 1991a; Sutton, 1991b), indicated by the open
circles, and by Kresin and Korber (Kresin and Korber,
1991), indicated by the open box. These data were ob-
tained by DSC using surfactant-containing emulsions of
glycerol-water drops. Sutton’s data in the low-cooling-
rate, high-concentration region show an increase in crit-
ical concentration with decreasing cooling rate, in con-
trast to the clear plateau evident in our results. This
discrepancy may be due to the surfactant, which may af-
fect nucleation. On the other hand, Kresin and Korber’s
single data point at high cooling rates lies well above
our data, suggesting either that the cooling rates actu-
ally achieved in their experiment were much lower than
reported, or that assumptions in modelling the fraction
of crystalline ice present within the vitreous phase were
incorrect.

4.5. Comparison with previous work

The basic methods used in the present work - X-ray
diﬀraction measurements (Garman and Mitchell, 1996;
McFerrin and Snell, 2002; Chinte et al., 2005) and vi-
sual observations (McFerrin and Snell, 2002) - have been
used in previous studies of the eﬀects of CPAs on vitri-
ﬁcation of cryoprotective solutions used in protein crys-
tallography. Garman and Mitchell determined glycerol
concentrations required to vitrify 50 crystallization solu-
tions from Hampton Research in a nitrogen cryostream at
T = 100 K. Drops were mounted in single size (∼ 1mm)
mohair loops, and their volumes, although not reported,
are estimated to be ∼ 0.2 − 0.6 µL. McFerrin and Snell
extended Garman and Mitchell’s experiments to deter-
mine critical concentrations of four CPAs (glycerol, PEG
400, ethylene glycol and propylene glycol) required to
vitrify 98 diﬀerent crystallization solutions from Hamp-
ton Research, using 0.7-1 mm CryoLoops and nitrogen
cryostream cooling. The critical concentrations deter-
mined for the single volume examined in both these stud-
ies for drops containing a single cryoprotectant are con-
sistent with the present results, although the present re-
sults provide better resolution (2% w/v vs. 6% w/v).
Recently, Chinte et al., (2005) used CryoLoops of sizes
of 1, 0.5, and 0.1 mm to again determine critical glycerol
conditions in a T=100 K nitrogen cryostream, for 12 dif-

ferent crystallization solutions from Hampton Research.
Sample volumes were not measured, but the expected
decrease in critical glycerol concentration with loop size
was observed.

5. CONCLUSION

We have described the ﬁrst quantitative and system-
atic measurements of critical cryoprotectant concentra-
tions for plunge cooling in liquid nitrogen in the volume
range relevant to cryocrystallography and to the cryop-
reservation of small numbers of cells. For most of the
fourteen CPAs examined, the critical CPA concentration
is constant at large volumes, decreases strongly with de-
creasing volume for intermediate volumes, and then has a
plateau at small volumes. We have combined these mea-
surements of critical concentration versus volume with
measurements of cooling times versus volume to obtain
the quantity of greatest intrinsic physical interest in ﬂash
cooling: the minimum CPA concentration for vitriﬁca-
tion versus cooling rate. Our results can be used to
develop more rational approaches to cryopreservation of
protein crystals and other biological samples. They also
provide a starting point for understanding the physics of
ﬂash cooling and vitriﬁcation of aqueous cryoprotectant
mixtures.

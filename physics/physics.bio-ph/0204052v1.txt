We have constructed a model for the kinetics of rupture of membranes under tension, apply-
ing physical principles relevant to lipid bilayers held together by hydrophobic interactions. The
membrane is characterized by the bulk compressibility (for expansion) K and the thickness of the
hydrophobic part of the bilayer thickness h. The model is a lattice model which incorporates strain
relaxation, and considers the nucleation of pores at constant area, constant temperature, and con-
stant particle number. The particle number is conserved by allowing multiple occupancy of the
sites. An equilibrium ”phase diagram” is constructed as a function of temperature and strain with
the pores total surface and distribution as the order parameters. With parameters relevant to sat-
urated phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid membranes, well deﬁned regions of ”no pores”, ”protopores
(non-critical pores)”, ”single hole rupture”, and ”multi-hole rupture” are found. The eﬀect of edge
healing (transformation from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic edge) has been included. The bound-
aries between the diﬀerent regions are very sharp. At room temperature, rupture is predicted at
3.75% strain, in accord with recent experiments on saturated chains. The model is also shown to
be applicable to super-thick membranes. The strain at rupture is determined by the free energy of
the lipid bilayer. We also present free energy curves as a function of total pore surface for various
values of tension and temperature, and discuss the fractal dimension of the pore edge.

INTRODUCTION

Fluid bilayer membranes separate the contents of cells from their surroundings. The stability of the ﬂuid membranes
under external perturbations is consequently of vital importance. In particular, if ruptured the functions of the cell
will be disabled. Rupture or lysis can be achieved in a number ways: mechanically, by suction through a pipette,
electrically by the electrocompressive forces that will act on the polar heads of the lipids [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and by
osmostic swelling of the cell [7, 8, 9]. With the rapid progress in microscopic manipulation techniques, the number of
experimental studies of the mechanical properties of the cell is rapidly increasing and we only quoted a few examples
of recent work [10]. For the bilayers studied, there is a signiﬁcant degree of consensus on the order of magnitude of the
quantities involved. For phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers, area expansion seems to be only 2% to 4% before rupture.
The corresponding external tension is of the order of 10−3 to 10−2 N/m [3, 11, 12, 13, 14]. It also seems that in liquid
membranes rupture occurs via the nucleation of holes [15]. This is consistent with what is expected from structural
considerations. Solid membranes as they go from brittle to ductile, experience rupture kinetics which evolve from
processes dominated by crack formation to hole formation [16]. Pore sizes can range from nano- to micro-meter in
radius. In electroporation experiments pores can last several microseconds [2, 3, 4, 5, 17]. Using mechanical means,
namely micropipette extrusion on vesicles, pores can be kept open for several seconds before resealing [18, 19]. Pore
formation can also serve a positive purpose in drug delivery and gene therapy [20, 21, 22].

Models of membrane rupture have been developed for a number of years. Most theories to date derive from a
model suggested by Litster a quarter of a century ago [23]. It explains the stability in terms of a pore edge energy,
or line tension. Under lateral stretching a membrane will by the creation of a pore reduce its surface energy. But as
long as the total edge energy created by the pore exceeds the gain in surface tension, the membrane will be stable.
The model deﬁnes a critical pore size and an energy barrier for the creation of an irreversibly growing pore. It has
been extended and applied by other groups in particular to electric breakdown situations [2, 24, 25]. Shillcock and
Boal also investigated the eﬀect of temperature on membrane stability [26]. Temperature increases the entropy of the
pore lowering its free energy. Even at zero tension, a minimum edge energy is required for stability. Netz and Schick
developed a mean-ﬁeld theory of the ﬂuid bilayers as stacks of diblock copolymers [27].

Our model considers pore creation as a thermally activated process [28]. There is an important entropic element
to the nucleation process. The relevant physical quantities in the bilayer have their origin in the hydrophobicity of
the lipid tails of the molecules as very clearly discussed by Wortis and Evans in a recent review article [29]. They
are the area compressibility K which results from the increased exposure of the hydrophobic tails as the membrane
is stretched, and the line energy λ is the result of the exposure of these tails to water along the edge of the pore.
In the model, the bilayer is characterized by an energy per site, essentially one molecule in size.
It incorporates
stress relaxation as a pore is created and grows. Pore-pore interactions are automatically taken into account. An
equilibrium phase diagram is constructed determining regions of no pores, non-critical pores (or protopores), single
hole rupture and multiple hole rupture. The phase diagram is in terms of the temperature and the area expansion of
the membrane. The critical temperatures scale with the strength of the hydrophobic interaction which to ﬁrst order
is linked to the length of the tails of the lipids. With parameters appropriate to pure phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid
bilayers, we ﬁnd that rupture occurs at 3.75% at room temperature in accord with most recent experimental results
with saturated chains [13, 14]. This predicted value applies to low strain rate since the membrane as it is remains in
mechanical equilibrium. We also predict the possibility of a multiple hole rupture scenario for normal membranes, and
for very thick membranes, a permissible area close to 50%. The following two sections develop the model. We ﬁrst
lay its physical foundations, and then present our Ising like model, which is solved using Monte Carlo simulations.
We continue with the results and ﬁnish with a discussion of the possible extensions of the model.

II. PORE CREATION

Upon area increase, stress will build up in the membrane. As mentioned earlier, being a liquid the most likely
stress release mechanism will be the formation of holes or pores. Let us imagine that a hole has appeared through
thermal induced stress ﬂuctuations. The question will be whether the gain in energy occasioned by the relaxation of
the surfactants will counterbalance the energy loss through exposure of the molecules to the solvent. If this is the
case, the hole will continue to grow into a large pore that will permit the system to relax almost entirely. For now,
we assume the process to be purely planar. Whether ﬂuctuations in the third dimension are important is an open
question. At ﬁrst thought they do not seem predominant.

Assuming an elastic regime for small expansions on a lattice of relaxed size am, for stresses that are not too great,

the energy associated with a stretching area of the membrane ∆a = atotal – am is given by

Em =

Kam (cid:18)

,

∆a
am (cid:19)

But if a hole is inserted, some of this stress will be relieved. Nevertheless, the edge of the new pore will now
be exposed to water. As the tails are hydrophobic, this will result in an increase of the energy proportional to the
perimeter of the pore. For simplicity, we will assume the pore to be circular. In the presence of a pore, the energy of
a stretched membrane then becomes

Em(ap) = 2λ√πam (cid:18)

where ap is the area of the pore. The parameters λ and K represent the line tension and the compressibility
respectively. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (2) is the total line energy, which represents the loss of energy on the perimeter
of the circular hole. The second term, the surface energy, is the loss in energy resulting from the relaxation of the
membrane induced by the hole, which augments the density of particles in the rest of the membrane. For lipids in
general, typical line tensions λ are of the order of 10−7 mN, so the edge energy of a 1nm radius pore is of the order
of 15-45 kBT at room temperature [18]. For PC’s with saturated chains, the compressibility K is approximately
230 mN/m [14].

For reasonably large systems, the energy barrier to rupture is given by λ2π/K(∆a/am)−1 and occurs for a pore
area ap = (λam√π/K)2/3. When ap exceeds that critical value, the pore will grow till the membrane reaches the
minimum energy conﬁguration ap = ∆a. This argument predicts a barrier height of the order of 103 kBTroom for
experimentally observed stretches, such as ∆a / am = 4% and a membrane of total area am = 1µm2, typical for PC
membranes. It implies, as mentioned above, that the entropic component is very signiﬁcant.

In an actual membrane, several small pores could be nucleated, as the energy of a pore of the size of a particle
in a stretched membrane is of the order of kBTroom. So for a given value of the expansion and temperature, there
would be a distribution of pore sizes. Shillcock and Boal, as mentioned in the introduction, investigated one aspect

of temperature eﬀects: the decrease in the free energy of the hole as its edges meander[26]. They considered a two-
dimensional, self-avoiding, tethered manifold consisting of spherical beads (vertices) linked by ﬂexible tethers (bonds).
A hole was generated and its time evolution was studied by Monte Carlo simulation. Eq. (2) forms the basis of the
zero temperature energetics. But at ﬁnite temperature, bonds can be broken or reformed, and the hole can change
shape and size. Shillcock and Boal ﬁnd that the minimum value of λ, even at zero tension is no longer zero but some
ﬁnite value λ∗a = 1.24 kBTroom, where a is the molecular size on the edge of the pore.

III. THE MODEL

What we are trying to simulate is a thermally activated nucleation process, it is therefore natural to consider a
model amenable to a Monte Carlo simulation. For ease of computation we consider a lattice model similar to the
well-known Ising model for binary mixtures, and consider the equilibrium phase diagram of the system as a function
of temperature and area expansion. This will reveal the expected scenarios of rupture as the membrane is expanded
slowly, quasi-statically, so that the membrane remains in thermodynamic equilibrium at every step of the way. We
will limit ourselves to two-dimensions, and to represent an isotropic liquid we will use a hexagonal lattice (6 closest
neighbors). We begin by presenting the standard binary mixture model (SBMM) as applied to our problem and then
describe the modiﬁcations that we have made to it to incorporate the stress relaxation that occurs when a hole is
created. In the SBMM, every site can be in either of two states, in our case “a” or “h”, representing respectively
sites occupied by a lipid or a hole. The site occupancy variable si, is equal to 1 if the site is in an “a” site and 0 if
it is in an “h” site. The indices i and j run from 1 to N , where N is the total number of sites. Let J aa(rij ), or its

The total number of sites N is ﬁxed. This model is usually studied in the canonical or grand canonical ensemble.
In the canonical ensemble occupied (a) and empty (h) sites are interchanged to preserve the total number of particles.
The conventional canonical model would be used if we were interested in the phase separation of a system, which is
not our case. In the grand canonical ensemble, the only dynamics that would be observed is the distribution of the
holes. Neither model is suitable to incorporate the relaxation created by the appearance of a hole. We start with
the SBMM in the canonical ensemble with an initial total number of particles equal to the number of sites N. We
now modify the model to impose the following constraints: the total area of the membrane stays constant as holes
are created and the total number of lipids stays constant. These lead to the following changes in the dynamics. (i)
Occupied sites, when holes are created, now contain more than one particle, actually N/(N
nh), where nh is the
number of hole sites at a given time. The occupancy variables si still only take the values 0 or 1, but the energy in
the membrane has to be rescaled to take into account the increased occupancy of the occupied sites. As a hole site
appears the density in the membrane increases. (ii) To avoid overestimating the line energy along a hole due to the
increased occupancy of the sites along the edges of holes, a negative line energy correction ∆Eline has to be added
which is evaluated in Section III B below. (iii) Finally the nucleation of hole sites relaxes the membrane and reduces

There is no interaction potential between holes: the eﬀects of a hole are to break bonds, creating a line energy, and
to relax the surface, reducing the surface energy. Because J hh(rij ) = 0 and by regrouping the constant term in the

A. THE INTERMOLECULAR POTENTIAL

The main contribution to the intermolecular potential J is the nearest neighbor hydrophobic interaction J aa(r),
which is determined by the structure and the nature of the lipid chains. We will follow here the arguments of Wortis
and Evans [29], but with the values of physical quantities updated, when required, with the results in Olbrich et al.
[13] and Rawicz et al. [14]. Forcing water to sit against a hydrophobic surface will increase the free energy by roughly
σ = 40mN/m. On the edge of a pore, the line energy therefore scales as

λ = σh,

(11)

where h is the hydrophobic height (heads not included) of the bilayer. For most PCs, this thickness is between 3 nm <
h < 4 nm. We can deduce the energy of a molecule by multiplying the line tension by the perimeter of a site, and divide
by 2 to avoid double counting. Assuming that amphiphiles are of cylindrical shape with a cross section of a0 = 0.5nm2,
an estimate of the energy per particle in the unstretched membrane is U0 =
40kBTroom
(kBTroom = 4.14

10−14 mJ =

10−18 mJ).

As seen before, the creation of a hole aﬀects not only the eﬀective number of particles on a site but also the average
distance between them. Therefore, the growth of a pore allows the stretched membrane to relax, leading to a decrease
in the lattice parameter. The drop in energy is determined by the compressibility K of the membrane, whose origin
is also hydrophobic. K can serve as the starting point for the construction of an interaction potential. Assuming a

linear regime for small expansions of the cross section area of a lipid a, the energy per molecule can be written as
C(a – a0), where a0 is the relaxed or equilibrium area. The proportionality factor C is expected to be of the order of
σ. For the repulsive force between polar heads, we chose a potential of the form D/a, where D is a positive constant.
The minimum energy is set to U0, the energy per molecule in an unstressed membrane. Combining these factors gives

0. Also, by comparing the curvature of this potential
around the minimum with the surface energy of Eq. (2), we obtain C = 1/4K. With an average compressibility of
230mN/m for most PCs with saturated chains [14], C is about 55mN/m, very close to σ as expected.

This energy per molecule is used to construct the shape of the main part of J, the ﬁrst neighbor hydrophobic
interaction J aa(r). For practical reasons, this interaction is expressed as a function of the lattice parameter in the
hexagonal grid:

In such a lattice, the area a and the nearest neighbor distance r are related by a = √3r2/2. The other term in J,
J ah(r), is a correction that is a measure of the deformation and consequently the stress ﬁeld created around a hole.
Because the correlation in a liquid decays exponentially [30], J ah(r) will be a weak repulsive exponential tail which, in
our model, does not act on the ﬁrst neighbors. We usually sum the interactions from the 2nd up to the 5th neighbors.
Explicitly, this potential has the form,

J ah(r) = Ge−r/r0,

where the amplitude parameter G is set arbitrarily to be about 10% of the main well. The amplitude of the exponential
term will be shown to have little eﬀect on the results.

This last interaction makes the shape of the potential slightly diﬀerent from the one derived in Eq. (13). The value
of J0, has to be adjusted so that the total energy per molecule at equilibrium is equal to U0 = 1
i J(r0i) in a perfect
2
hexagonal lattice. Therefore, the artiﬁcially induced stress ﬁeld shown in Eq. (14) does not aﬀect the depth of the
potential.

B. The line energy correction

The surface of the membrane and the number of particles are both kept constant leading to the weight of an
occupied site being slightly diﬀerent from one. This renormalization is perfectly consistent with the surface energy of
a pore which scales as NKr 2. But for the line energy, which is proportional only to the perimeter of a hole, there is a
dimension problem. Because each site contains now more than one particle, the correction will be to count only the
ones that are on the edge, not the deeper ones. In a hexagonal lattice, a particle facing a hole will normally lose two
bonds, which corresponds to an interaction of 1
4J aa(˜r)] = J aa(˜r). This way, the line energy per particle
2 [6J aa(˜r)

J aa(˜r)/˜r, which is a positive value given that J aa(r) < 0.
on the edge of a pore per unit length can be written as
−
With this in mind, we can write the correct expression for the line energy as

where Lah is the number of particle-hole interactions (between the sites), and therefore the number of sites along
the perimeter of all the pores in the membrane. This way, Lahr represents the perimeter of the entire interface
particles-holes. Due to the renormalization factors given by Eqs. (6) and (5), the equivalent expression in the model
for the line energy is given by

C. The healing on the edge of a pore

Another eﬀect that we consider is the rearrangement of the molecules on the edge of a pore to reduce the hydropho-
bicity. The amphiphiles on the edge can arrange themselves in an arc shape to produce a bevelled edge. We call
this healing of a the edge of the pore. Modeling this is quite complicated because pores keep evolving, shrinking or
growing. To simplify the problem, we will only consider one possible bending angle (90 deg) and 6 possible horizontal
orientations, which correspond to the 6 neighbor sites. As shown in ﬁgure 1a, one bended site on the edge of a pore
will then represent the entire arc. A bended site will now interact diﬀerently with its 6 neighbors. Holes in front of
a bended site will lower the energy, as a site being oriented through another particle will not be favorable because
of the heads repulsion. However, a site facing away from a hole will deﬁnitely be unfavorable, and so is the case for
a site facing away from a particle. This last interaction will not be favorable because the gap created between the
particles can act as a channel for water. Finally, two cases are considered impossible: an amphiphile directly facing
away from a hole and an amphiphile directly facing another one. As those energies are small compared to the real
intermolecular interactions, we will deﬁne for simplicity all the favorable interactions as α (a negative value) and the
unfavorable ones as β (positive). All the possible interactions are summarized in ﬁgure 1b.

The energy S associated with a bended site is then reduced to three degenerate cases (assuming that we eliminate

the impossible cases discussed earlier):

where nh,f ront is the number of holes facing the bended site. This energy can be rewritten as

1α + 5β; when nh,f ront = 1
2α + 4β; when nh,f ront = 2
3α + 3β; when nh,f ront = 3

,

S = 




S = (α

β)nhf ront + 6β.

−

The energy diﬀerence between a hydrophobic and a beveled edge is small [29]. A reasonable choice is to choose

−

α =

0.25 U0 and β = 0.1 U0 to have a healing energy of 0.10 U0 along a straight edge.

This energy is completely separated from H and all the corrections associated with it. We are therefore in the
approximation that even if the occupancy of the sites is greater than one, only one particle on each site can be healed.
However, the metropolis algorithm will again be used to create and annihilate orientations. The only time that these
healing eﬀects will interfere with the main system is when a site containing a bended particle becomes a hole and
when a hole fronting a healed particle is revived. Those situations correspond respectively to a healed pore that is
either growing or shrinking. Removing the healed edge every time that the shape of a pore is modiﬁed would consist
in an error in the dynamics. To correct this situation, swap functions have been included in the model to be able to
move the edge of a pore as it is evolving in time. More precisely, if a pore is growing by converting a healed site onto
a hole, the swap functions will translate this oriented particle backward, therefore on the new edge. Moreover, if it is
shrinking, it will be possible to forward the oriented particle onto the edge of the smaller pore.

Because this energy is of the order of kBTroom, the healing eﬀects in this model will be almost totally entropic at
room temperature. In other words, except for low temperatures, the edge of a stable pore is only about 50% healed.
Nevertheless, it does increase hysteresis eﬀects in the creation and closing of pores, as physically expected.

D. Programming and Analysis

To create and recover holes in the membrane up to an equilibrium point, we use the Metropolis algorithm in the
Monte Carlo simulation. The mass of a hole is zero, but the mass of the system or number of particles is conserved
through the renormalization of Eq. (6). Although the occupation of sites changes as the simulation evolves, detailed
balance is satisﬁed because each conﬁguration of pores has a uniquely deﬁned energy. This energy does not depend
upon the path followed to reach it. The transition probability between a given initial and ﬁnal conﬁguration will also
be unique and reversible. If we choose an occupied site with the same probability than an empty site, that is, we
select particles or holes according to their surface distribution, the acceptance rule will be given by

acc(i

f ) = min(1, exp

in order to respect detailed balance. This acceptance rule is the usual one for a Monte Carlo simulation in the
canonical ensemble. Finally, periodic boundary conditions are considered.

The approach is highly eﬃcient and large systems can be studied, up to 107 particles. Usually within a 100 samplings

per site, the equilibrium state is reached.

IV. RESULTS

We study the scenario of rupture through an “equilibrium” phase diagram that looks at the diﬀerent qualitative
changes in the distribution of pores as a function of stretching for temperatures around kBTroom. This corresponds to
slow (quasistatic) stretching rates that keep the membrane in a state of equilibrium with respect to the applied stress.
In the case of a higher rate of expansion, larger stretches and therefore tensions will be needed to break the membrane
[28]. Because we are considering thermally activated processes, higher temperatures in this model are equivalent to
weaker interactions. The reduced temperature used is kBT /U0, where U0 is the energy of a particle in a relaxed
lattice. To study the reversibility of membrane lysis, hysteresis curves were constructed to compare the number of
holes and their distribution as we ﬁrst stretch the membrane to rupture, and then let it relax to zero tension. This
study revealed that the rupture transition is ﬁrst order, with a strong hysteresis. The fractal dimensions of stable
pores were computed at diﬀerent temperature as a measure of their entropy and shape.

Bilayer membranes can form vesicles of a variety of shapes [29]. They are normally present in nature as spherical
vesicles of radii between 1-10 µm [13, 14, 29]. Our phase diagrams are for systems of area around 5µm2, corresponding
106 particles. It is an interesting issue to see the dependence of rupture on the system size, if any. For systems
to
larger than 105 particles, the rupture point stabilizes at a stretch of 3.75% at room temperature (Fig. 2). For smaller
systems, we observe a signiﬁcant increase. This increase, of course, is mainly due to the loss of entropy, but the
energy barrier of Eq. (2) can also be shown to rise for smaller systems. Therefore, for all the simulations, except when
speciﬁcied, a lattice of 1.1 million phosphatidylcholine (PC) type amphiphiles is used.

A. Phase diagram

Qualitatively, we can separate the membrane behavior in four regimes: the no pore region, where nh < 1%∆a/a,
that is less than 1% of the new surface was converted into holes to relax the system; protopores, where the number
of holes is between 1%∆a/a < nh < 90%∆a/a and the pores (group of holes) are of sizes not bigger than 2-3
particles; rupture, where the number of holes nh > 90%∆a/a are distributed in only a few massive pores (< 10);
and ﬁnally, multiple rupture, for nh > 90%∆a/a and the number of pores greater than 10. The transient case, where
nh < 90%∆a/a with only a few pores on average, has never been observed at equilibrium.

In the full potential scheme for PCs (ﬁg. 3a), at room temperature, we observe a ﬁrst order transition between the
no pore and the rupture regime at a stretch of ∆a/a = 3.75%. This seems to be in accordance with experimental
results [13,14], which give a critical tension to rupture of τ
10
mN/m, giving a stretch of exactly∆a/a = 3.75%
0.20%. Also, the membrane becomes unstable with no applied
tension at kBT /U0 = 0.65, which is comparable to the value of 0.6 of Shillcock and Boal [26].

1 mN/m with a compressibility of K = 240

If we include only the main interaction J AA(rij ), we observe a slight increase in the rupture tension at higher
temperatures, and also a reduction in the size of the protopore regime. The reason is that with no stress ﬁeld,
holes tend to coalesce. This directly reduces the protopore regime part of the rupture activation kinetics at higher
temperatures. As protopores, or small non-stable pores have experimentally been observed [4], we are to believe that
the exponential tail plays an important role in the kinetics of membrane rupture.

For both ﬁgures 3a and 3b, the bilayer lipid chain length was ﬁxed at h

= 3.5nm. To explore the applicability
of the model, thicker membranes were considered: (i) with double length lipid chains, h
= 7.0nm (Fig. 3c) and
= 20.0nm (Fig. 3d). For the double membrane, the hydrophobicity σ, therefore
(ii) a super-membrane with h
the compressibility K, are the same as for the normal membrane. Only the line energy, and hence U0, are doubled.
The scale for the reduced temperature kBT /U0 is therefore multiplied by a factor 1/2. For the super-membrane with
h* = 20.0nm, the compressibility has been observed to be K = 100mN/m [31], which is smaller than the 230mN/m
for the PC membranes. We assumed for simplicity that the lateral size of the molecules remains unchanged. A line
energy 20/3.5 times larger was therefore used, and U0 is increased by a total factor of 2.9. With those parameters, our
critical stretch at room temperature is 41%, a little lower than the 50% observed experimentally [31, 32]. In addition
to uncertainties in the basic parameters, another possible reason is that our potential deﬁned in Eq. (13) assumes
small stretches about a minimum, and therefore not stretches of 50%.

B. Hysteresis

To illustrate the properties of the real dynamics, we show a single sample put through a full cycle of expansion and
compression. This is done again in a quasi-static process, i.e., at each step the system is allowed to relax. As shown
in Fig. 4, at low temperature, hysteresis eﬀects are very strong. Rupture and healing occur through one pore. At
high temperature, hysteresis is reduced and there are many more pores.

The healing eﬀect on the edge of a pore plays a role in hysteresis. Once a stable hole is created, it is very likely
that particles on its edge will heal. Closing the pore completely through the hysteresis loop will force some bended
sites to face one another. As discussed previously, this is an impossible conﬁguration. As a consequence, small holes
will persist until smaller tension than expected.

C. Shape of the pores

The shape of a pore is estimated from the scaling relationship between the pore area and its perimeter. At diﬀerent
temperatures for a stretching of 3% (just before rupture), we break the membrane by inserting a hole at the origin.
After the pore is fully opened and stable, we compute the fractal dimension of this pore to get the proportionality
between the area of a pore and its circumference. The results are plotted in Figure 5. The fractal dimension decreases
as the temperature is raised. This is caused by increased irregularities along the edge of the pore.

At the temperature kBT /U0 = 0.65 where rupture occurs spontaneously at zero tension, one would expect the
scaling relationship applicable to a self-avoiding ring [26]. Or the area of the pore should scale as A = A0l3/2,
where l is the perimeter, and A0 a proportionality factor, not relevant here. In this case, our model gives a scaling
relationship of A = A0l1.57±0.15 in agreement with this argument.

D. Free energy

The plot of the free energy F of the system as a function of the number of holes cannot be obtained directly from the
simulation, since the system will always stabilize around the number of holes that minimizes the free energy. One way
to obtain this curve is by the technique known as umbrella sampling. It consists in adding to the initial Hamiltonian
H a harmonic potential W (nh), known as a bias potential, centered at an arbitrary nh*. We let the system evolve to
get occupation probabilities Pbias around a given nh*. This is repeated for a sequence of nh* spanning the range of
nh’s of interest. From the set of segments of Pbias, probabilities P ′(nh)for the unbiased system are obtained. These
are linked together to generate the correct probability function P (nh). The free energy F is obtained directly from
F = log(P ) + C.

The big diﬀerence between the free energy curves plotted in Fig. 6 and the one predicted by Eq. (2) is the eﬀect
of entropy near nh = 0. As discussed previously, without entropy, the barrier to rupture is physically prohibitive.
Entropy can also shift the local minimum near zero pore size to a nonzero value, noted as the protopore regime.
There is another shift near the global minimum, where the amphiphiles do not relax entirely when membrane rupture
occurs. There is still a bit of tension. This eﬀect, predicted by the theoretical model, is not entropic, but purely
energetic, a contribution of the line energy to the ﬁnal equilibrium state.

V. CONCLUSION

9

We have developed a model for the rupture of a membrane held together by hydrophobic forces. In spite of their
complex molecular structure lipid bilayer membranes oﬀer an ideal model system as hydrophobicity is responsible for
both the line energy and the bulk compressibility (for extension). Our minimal model explains current results on PC
and thicker artiﬁcial bilayers for the tension and area expansion at rupture. The stability results of Shillcock and Boal
[26] for unstressed membranes have also been reproduced. The model is robust in the sense that the essential features
of the results are unchanged even if healing on the edge of the pore and the stress ﬁeld around a pore are neglected.
The model requires little computer time allowing the handling of real size vesicles. Entropic and nucleation eﬀects
are included naturally.

The structural integrity of a lipid bilayer is considerably aﬀected by its composition; Biological membrane structure
can be fairly complex. Diﬀerent types of lipids, cholesterols, peptides, and proteins will play an important role in
determining membrane stability. The model has the potential of handling these inclusions.

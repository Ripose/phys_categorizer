(December 25, 2013)

The liquid crystalline model biomembrane system consisting of a stack of interacting membranes
is studied by the newly developed Fourier Monte Carlo simulation technique.
In comparison to
perturbation theory, substantial quantitative discrepancies are found that aﬀect determination of
interbilayer interactions. A harmonic theory is also routinely used to interpret x-ray scattering
line shapes; this is shown to be valid because the distance dependence of the simulated correlation
functions can be fairly well ﬁt by the harmonic theory.

Stacks of lipid bilayers (see Fig. 1) are model systems
for biomembranes that are much studied for two reasons.
First, such stacks diﬀract fairly well and this facilitates
determination of the structure of individual membranes,
which is of primary interest in biophysics. However, these
stacks are not crystals with the long range order that is
assumed in traditional biophysical analysis, but smectic
liquid crystals with quasi-long-range order. Therefore,
quantitative use of the scattering intensity for structure
determination requires correction for the ﬂuctuations en-
demic in such systems [1]. A harmonic theory [2,3] that
predicts power law tails in the scattering line shapes ﬁts
membrane data very well [4,5], but the anharmonicities
that are inherent in realistic potentials have remained a
concern for quantitative interpretation [6,7], even though
a renormalization group analysis suggested that such ef-
fects are small [8].

FIG. 1. Snapshot of a slice through a simulated stack of
M = 8 two-dimensional L × L ﬂuctuating membranes. Since
internal membrane structure is irrelevant here, each mem-
brane is depicted as a line. The average position of each
membrane is shown by a dashed line.

Stacks of bilayers are also much studied because they
provide ideal environments to study fundamental inter-
actions between bilayers, especially since the range of
interbilayer distances a can be systematically varied by
applying osmotic pressure P [9]. The corresponding the-

1

ory [10] is an approximate ﬁrst-order perturbation theory
that again relies on harmonic assumptions, such as the
normality of the probability distribution function (pdf)
of the interbilayer spacing. While this theory has been
a valuable guide, use of it to extract fundamental inter-
bilayer interactions from P (a) data may be inaccurate.

Both these issues are addressed using Monte Carlo sim-
ulations with realistic intermembrane potentials for the
biologically relevant regime where the interbilayer water
spacing a is of order 5−30˚A and each membrane is ﬂexible
with bending modulus Kc≃10 − 25kBT . In this regime,
sometimes called the soft conﬁnement regime [10], it is
usually supposed that the primary interbilayer interac-
tions for dipolar lipids are the attractive van der Waals
potential and the repulsive hydration potential,

(1)

−z/λ,

V (z) = −

H
12πz2 + Aλe
where z is the local distance between two membranes
[11]. These interactions are signiﬁcantly anharmonic,
to the extent that the potential of a membrane mid-
way between two neighboring membranes (at the dashed
positions in Fig. 1) may have a maximum instead of
a minimum. The contrasting regime, sometimes called
the hard conﬁnement regime, consists of only excluded
volume or steric interactions between neighboring mem-
branes. That regime is appropriate when a is of order
100˚A because the hydration force is short range (λ≈2˚A).
For hard conﬁnement the eﬀective interbilayer force is
the entropic ﬂuctuation pressure which decays as a−3
[12]. Fluctuation forces also exist in the soft conﬁnement
regime, and are determined by our simulations.

In addition to the interbilayer interactions in Eq.(1),
the energy of each membrane includes a bending term,
proportional to the square of the local curvature of the
membrane. Let um(x, y) be the local displacement of the
mth membrane from its average position as shown on
Fig. 1. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the
plane of each membrane and also along the stack, so that
uM ≡u0. The membranes can collide, but cannot overlap,
so that um+1 + a≥um, where a is the average distance
between membranes. The Hamiltonian of the stack is

mostly for the critical phenomenon of unbinding; this
occurs in the limit of large average membrane spacing,
where the van der Waals interaction is the main one, in
addition to the spatial constraints. We have also per-
formed simulations in the hard conﬁnement regime and
obtained results for the Helfrich ﬂuctuation free energy
cf lT 2/Kca2 with cf l≈0.1, in agreement with [14,16].

The simulation method, called the Fourier Monte
Carlo method, was developed for single membranes be-
tween hard walls [13] and is easily extended to stacks of
membranes. Each membrane in the stack is represented
by a complex array of dimensions N × N of Fourier dis-
placement amplitudes. Instead of moving one lattice site
at a time, moves are made in Fourier space and a whole
membrane is displaced in each move. This allows larger
moves and faster equilibration, without incurring large
increases in the bending energy. One diﬀerence with our
previous simulations [13] is that a ﬁxed osmotic pressure
P ensemble is employed instead of the previous ﬁxed a
ensemble, so that a is obtained as a function of P rather
than vice versa. Of course, use of the P ensemble is
fundamentally no diﬀerent, but it does have better con-
vergence properties that we now discuss.

FIG. 2. Eﬀect of ﬁnite density (N = 6, ..., 32) on
a(solid squares) and ∆(open circles and right hand ordi-
nate) for realistic interaction parameters given in [17] and
for P = 104erg/cm3.

Simulations performed systematically as a function of
lattice size, density of lattice points, and number of mem-
branes in the stack show that accurate results for inﬁnite,
continuous membranes in inﬁnite stacks can be obtained
at one P in real time of the order of one day on a Pen-
tium Pro PC. The most sensitive ﬁnite-size parameter is
the “density” of each membrane N/L, since when N is
varied from 6 to 32, the root mean square ﬂuctuation in
nearest neighbor spacing, deﬁned as ∆, can easily change
by 40%, and the changes in a are also signiﬁcant. This is
shown in Fig.2, which also shows that accurate values can
be obtained by extrapolation. By comparison, variations
with lateral system size L at ﬁxed N/L are negligible
(≈0.2% for L≥700˚A), as are variations with M (≈1% for
M ≥8) for a and ∆.

It may be noted that stacks of several membranes

FIG. 3. Simulation results (symbols) and perturbation the-
ory (lines) for ∆ and logP versus a for the parameter set in
[17] with attractive interaction (solid squares and lines) and
with no attractive interaction (open circles and dashed lines).

Figure 3 shows results for P and ∆ as functions of
a for realistic values of the potentials [17]. Also shown
are results for a simpler case when the attractive van der
Waals force is absent so that the potential experienced by
each membrane has a minimum in the middle between its
neighbors and is therefore more like a harmonic potential.
Fig.3 also shows results based on the perturbation ap-
proximation [10] which was developed for a single mem-
brane between hard walls. After comparing to harmonic
theory for multiple membranes [5], we adjusted [10] for
the case of multiple membranes by putting a factor of 4/π
into the relations for the ﬂuctuational free energy and for
∆2, and then followed essentially the same procedure as
in [10]. With this factor, agreement between the per-
turbation theory and the simulations is quite good for
small a where the total interaction is harmonic-like be-
cause the repulsive hydration potential is dominant and
the ﬂuctuations are relatively small. The simulations and

2

the theory also agree for P (a) when there is no attrac-
tive van der Waals interaction. However, at larger a, the
simulated ∆ increases with a faster than the perturba-
tion approximation for either intermembrane potential.
A large diﬀerence between the simulation results and the
perturbation theory occurs when the potential has an
attractive van der Waals part. The theory predicts that
ao = 25.8˚A for P = 0, more than 5˚A larger than the
true value ao = 20.2±0.1˚A obtained by simulation.
It
is also of interest to compare the values of µ ≡ (∆/a)2
to the hard conﬁnement values. In Fig.3 the range of µ
is 0.06 − 0.12, in good agreement with experiment [5],
but considerably smaller than the hard conﬁnement esti-
mates 0.16 − 0.21 [10,12,16,18].

FIG. 4. Distribution of the nearest neighbor distance for
parameters in [17] and P = 104erg/cm3 for diﬀerent mem-
brane densities. The bottom ﬁgure shows the same results as
the top one, scaled and shifted so as to facilitate comparison
to the standard normal distribution, denoted N (0, 1).

Existing approximations [10,19] assume that the dis-
tribution of distance between two nearest neighbor mem-
branes is essentially Gaussian. Simulation results in Fig.
4 demonstrate that the actual pdf diﬀers substantially
from a normal distribution. Although the distribution
is more non-normal for small N , it is nevertheless clear
that even the limiting distribution is not normal. A dis-
tinguishing feature of the true pdf is a rapid decay at
small distances. This validates the use of a cutoﬀ [11]
near 2˚A to avoid the formal divergence of the vdW poten-
tial. Another feature evident in Fig. 4 is the asymmetry

3

of the actual pdf which shows that large ﬂuctuations to
larger intermembrane spacings are more probable than
large ﬂuctuations to smaller spacings. Overall, the shape
of pdf is consistent with that of the interaction potential.
We turn next to the issue of whether harmonic ﬂuc-
tuation theory [2,3] should be expected to be reliable
when interpreting detailed line shapes [4,5] from stacks
of bilayers and smectic liquid crystals that have strongly
anharmonic interactions. The most important quantity
for determining the line shapes for powder samples [3] is
the correlation function in the z-direction, which is es-
sentially the k dependence of the mean square relative
displacement of two membranes of the stack ∆2(k) ≡
h(u(m + k) − u(m))2i, where m and m + k are the mem-
brane indices, and averages over m are performed for
simulation eﬃciency. Fig.5 shows proﬁles of ∆(k), ob-
tained for stacks with various numbers M of membranes.
Convergence with M suggests that values of ∆(k) are
suﬃciently accurate for k < M/4. However, to minimize
the ﬁnite size eﬀect in a comparison with harmonic the-
ory, Fig. 5 compares the results of the simulation with
M = 32 with the exact harmonic result, also for M = 32.
In the harmonic theory the bare interbilayer interactions
are approximated with a compression modulus B. In Fig.
5 a value of B = 1.9·1013erg/cm4 was chosen to match
the large k end of the M = 32 curve. The resulting ∆(k)
proﬁle allows one to see that ∆≡∆(1) is in fact a good
proxy for describing the long-range correlations, since the
diﬀerence between ∆, implied by the “harmonic curve”,
and the actual ∆ for the stack is about only 0.2˚A, i.e.
relatively small compared to ∆ = 4.6˚A. Another way to
see how interactions are renormalized from short to long
range is to compute, for diﬀerent k, the implied strength
B(k) of the harmonic potential that would result in the
same value of ∆(k) as obtained by simulations for a stack
with realistic interactions. The bottom panel of Fig.5
presents a plot of the harmonic value of B(k) required to
give the simulation value of ∆(k). This shows that, for
large k, the system can be reasonably well approximated
by one with harmonic interactions with constant B.

How is it that the harmonic theory works quite well
for the correlation functions in the preceding paragraph
and not so well for P and ∆ in Fig. 3? The answer
is that the perturbation theory does not yield the best
value of B; for the example in Fig.5 the theory yields
a larger B = 5.4·1013erg/cm4 which accounts for the
smaller value of ∆ in Fig. 3.

We turn ﬁnally to the entropic ﬂuctuation pressure in
a stack of membranes, which is deﬁned to be the diﬀer-
ence between the applied pressure, and the pressure due
to the bare van der Waals and hydration interactions.
Perturbation theory [10], experiment [5] and simulations
on a single membrane between hard walls [13] all agree
that the decay of the ﬂuctuation pressure is closer to ex-
ponential, with a decay length λf l, although the value of
λf l found in both experiment and simulations is larger
than the perturbation theory prediction λf l = 2λ. Fig.
6 shows the same result for simulations of stacks.

valid, even though the analysis of the basic x-ray scat-
tering data is based on a harmonic theory. However, the
intrinsic anharmonic nature of realistic interactions be-
tween bilayers in stacks makes it diﬃcult to devise quan-
titatively accurate analytic or perturbation theories. We
show here that the Fourier Monte Carlo method is suﬃ-
ciently fast that it provides a viable alternative. Indeed,
it is now possible to consider using it as part of a com-
prehensive data analysis program to determine the best
values of the fundamental interaction parameters.

[11] The formal divergence of the van der Waals potential at
z = 0 is non-physical, being masked by stronger steric
interactions. In the simulations, a constant potential is
used when |z| is smaller than where V (z) has a maximum.
For these values of z, which are typically less than 2˚A the
hydration potential is so large that few membrane pairs
approach this closely.

Long-Bone Allometry of Terrestrial Mammals and the
Geometric-Shape and Elastic-Force Constraints of Bone Evolution
.

A natural similarity in body dimensions of terrestrial animals noticed by
ancient philosophers remains the main key to the problem of mammalian
skeletal evolution with body mass explored in theoretical and experimental
biology and tested by comparative zoologists. We discuss the long-standing
problem of mammalian bone allometry commonly studied in terms of the
so-called ”geometric”, ”elastic”, and ”static stress” similarities by McMahon
(1973, 1975a, 1975b). We revise the fundamental assumptions underlying
these similarities and give new physical insights into geometric-shape and
elastic-force constraints imposed on spatial evolution of mammalian long
bones.

A realistic description of an animal skeletal bone might be thought in
terms of a hollow, irregular, curved structural rigid beam, whose linear di-
mensions guarantee the avoidance of fracture caused by axial and non-axial
external peak loads. Meanwhile, most mammalian skeletal bones manifest a
geometric similarity that permits one to introduce a cylinder-shape approx-
imation through the characteristic dimensions Dis and Lis related to bone
diameter and length for a given bone i of a certain mammalian species s.
This surmise can be veriﬁed experimentally with the help of bone allometry,

which provides data on mammalian allometric exponents di and li through
the power-law scaling regressions Dis = cisM di and Lis = hisM li, where body
mass M (≡ M (body)
) is treated as an external mammalian parameter and cis
and his are constants. The i-bone allometric exponents obey the cylindric-
shape evolution constraint equation 2di + li = 1. This immediately follows
from (i) the relation between bone mass Mis and its volume D2
isLis (Mis =
ρD2
isLis , ρ is bone density), (ii) the aforegiven scaling regressions, and from
(iii) McMahon’s hypothesis that skeletal mass is linearly scaled to body mass,
i.e., M (skel)
∝ Mis ∝ M. In what follows, we give an analysis of the bone
dimension scaling in terms of the ”overall-bone” (hereafter eﬀective bone)
mammalian allometric exponents d = n−1Σn
i=1li, which
obey the corresponding cylindric-shape constraint 2d + l = 1 resulting from
the corresponding i-bone constraint averaged over n mammalian bones. Be-
low we give statistical analysis for experimental data by Christiansen (1999b)
on allometric exponents for mammalian long bones and show that it corrob-
orates the cylindric-shape approximation very accurately.

More sophisticated bone allometric studies provide information on evo-
lution of real non-circular hollow bones with a cross section A(exp)
(∝ M ai),
approximated by coaxial cylinders of length Lis, with external Dis and inter-
nal dis diameters and of area Ais = π(D2
is)/4. As follows from Table 2 by
is
Selker and Carter (1989) given for allometric exponents for Artiodactyl long
bones, the circle-cross-section geometric similarity explicit in the constraint
ai = 2di works well (with the accuracy amounting to 5%). Furthermore,
similar to the internal bone diameter, the bone curvature, also shows a great
deal of variation between diﬀerent i-bones in the same animal and among dif-
ferent s-animals, but does not show a signiﬁcant inﬂuence from animal mass
(Selker and Carter, 1989). We see that geometric similarity does not depend
on local deviations of bone shape from the ideal cylinder form and can there-
fore be castled into the cylindric-shape evolution constraint equation. It is
worth noting that the geometric similarity by McMahon (1975b) corresponds
to a particular case of the isometric solution of the cylindric-shape constraint
given by d0 = l0 = 1/3 and a0 = 2/3.

Generally speaking, elastic-force mammalian similarity suggests that there
exists a unique mechanism, attributed to the natural elasticity of the bones
of adult animals, that provides an escape from the critical elastic deforma-
tion (fracture) of bones under peak mechanical stresses. This similarity is
ensured by a safety factor of about 2-4, independent of mammalian mass

is where E is the elastic modulus and I is = πDis

(see Biewener, 1990 among others). Following Rashevsky (1948) and McMa-
hon (1973), the elastic similarity can be introduced in explicit form on the
basis of a mechanical analogy that takes place between a given bone (or an
animal trunk) and a quasi-cylindrical, rigid beam. Elastic-force mammalian
similarity, in a way, completes the geometric-shape similarity that eventu-
ally provides predictions for the dimension-growth eﬀective bone exponents
d and l tested by long bone allometry. For the case of long bones, it seems
plausible to approximate the long (Dis ≪ Lis) cylindrical beams by rigid
rods for which the condition of elastic instability against axial loads was ﬁrst
established by Euler. This was given in terms of the critical elastic-buckling
force F (crit)
4/64
is the second cross-area moment of inertia. A numerical factor c depends on
the boundary conditions, i.e. on the way of application of the axial external
forces at the rod ends. One can show (see e.g. Landau and Lifshits, 1989)
that c = 1 and 4 for the cases of both the non-ﬁxed (on the hinges) ends
and ﬁxed ends, respectively. The ﬁrst case was cited by Hokkanen (1986)
concerning with a clariﬁcation of the elastic similarity employed by McMa-
hon and Rashevsky. Then, Carter and Spengler (1982, cited by Selker and
Carter, 1989) reported that long bones in living animals are extremely rarely
fractured by axial loads. This is due to the curved structure of bones, which
in the case of in vivo axial loading introduce bending moments in their dia-
physis, that create stresses of a greater amplitude than those caused by pure
axial loading (Selker and Carter, 1989). This real case can also be related to
Euler’s solution with c = 1. McMahon (1973) extended these conditions for
the case of the limbs of trees, when a free horizontal bending of the top from
the trunk is caused by proper weight. This results in c = 1/4 and permits
one to summarize all the buckling-deformation cases for the critical elastic
force as

McMahon (1973) suggested additionally that all bone elastic forces for
terrestrial mammals are caused solely by animal weight (F (crit)

is the gravitation constant) and therefore McMahon’s elastic similarity for
mammalian long bones can be introduced (see also discussion by Hokkanen,
1986) through (i) the elastic-rod, critical-force and (ii) the cylindric-shape
constraints, namely

a) 4d − 2l = 1 and b) 2d + l = 1.
Similarly to the aforegiven b constraint, the elastic-force a constraint in (2)
follows from the allometric bone-dimension scaling applied to (1) further av-
eraged over all long bones. The system of two equations provides the well
known (McMahon, 1973) elastic model predictions for the bone diameter
d(buckl)
= 1/4 exponents, along with the length-
0
to-diameter (l(buckl)
= 2/3, related
0
to the allometric scaling Lis ∽ Dλi
is . The latter was in part corroborated
by bone allometry by McMahon (1975b) who derived λ(exp)
= 0.67, 0.52
and 0.83 for families, respectively, Bovidae, Suids, and Cervids in the or-
der Artiodactyla. A similar study by Alexander (1997) established d(exp)
= 0.34 and l(exp)
= 0.76 for the family Bodivie. When
a wider variety of phylogenetically and anatomically distinct samples were
analyzed within a larger body size range, experimental allometric exponents
exhibited rather the isometric scenario (λ0 = 1) than the elastic model be-
havior predicted by McMahon (1973, 1975a). This incompatibility with long-
bone allometric observations was reported among others by Alexander et al.
(1979a) and Biewener (1983). Furthermore, recent systematic investigations
by Christiansen (1999a, 1999b) suggest that experimental observations of
bone dimensions “support neither geometric nor elastic similarity, making
both questionable as a means of explaining long-bone scaling in terrestrial
mammals”. Moreover, according to criticism by Economos (1983) shared by
Christiansen (1999b), no satisfactory explanation for any power-law scaling
observed in mammalian allometry can be expected. From the physical point
of view, however, there is no doubt that long bones possess simultaneously
cylindrical-type-shape and elastic-critical-force similarities. We therefore re-
vise the underlying hypotheses of the elastic model by McMahon (1973) to
describe the elastic-force (F (max)
elast ) and geometric-
elast
shape (M (skel)

∝ M and F (crit)
∽ M) similarities in terms of constraints given in (2).

First, under locomotion peak dynamic conditions, skeletal elastic forces
of animals may exceed those driven by static body weight (Hokkanen, 1986),
and therefore the peak stresses in bones are due to muscle contractions, rather
than to gravity (Carter et al., 1980, Biewener, 1982, Rubin and Lanyon, 1984,
Selker and Carter, 1989, and Biewener, 1991). This implies that the peak
elastic forces in (1) should be substituted by those of muscle subsystem (mus-
cles, tendons and ligaments), which stores and return elastic energy (Farley

4

elast = F (max)

et al. 1993), i.e., F (max)
musc . Furthermore, after Rubin (1984) many
studies provide strong evidence that the maximum muscle strains recorded
in rigorous activities of animals are independent of body mass, and thus
muscle-induced bone stresses are F (max)
elast /Am ∝ M 0, where Am is the cross-
section area of muscle ﬁbers. This, in turn, exhibits scaling to body mass
through the muscle-area allometric exponent am deﬁned through the scal-
ing law Am ∝ M am. As a consequence, the elastic-buckling-force constraint
should be modiﬁed and changed in (2) for 4d − 2l = a, with a = am.

Second, in view of the observation by Prange et al. (1979) of nonlinear
evolution of skeletal mass with body mass M, Hokkanen (1986) noted that
the corresponding McMahon’s hypothesis (M (skel)
∽ M) makes the b con-
straint inaccurate in (2). With taking into account the bone-mass-to-body-
isLis ∝ M bi, one obtains the following modiﬁed
mass scaling law Mis = ρD2
cylindrical-shape bone constraint for terrestrial mammals: 2di+li = bi. Mod-
iﬁed in such a way McMahon’s constraint results in a) 4d − 2l = a and b)
2d + l = b that provides a new prediction due to elastic-buckling similarity,
namely

s

d(buckl) =

a(exp) + 2b(exp)

and l(buckl) =

2b(exp) − a(exp)

.

(3)

This prediction is tested below on the basis of the experimental data on
muscle-area a(exp) and bone-mass b(exp) mammalian eﬀective exponents.

Third, after Alexander et al. (1979b) it has been widely recognized that
the external critical loads acting parallel to the axis of the bone shaft (di-
aphysis) are often fewer that those applied in the perpendicular direction,
although the corresponding peak stresses are of the same order of magnitude
(see Rubin and Lanyon, 1984). Within the context of theory of elasticity,
this experimental ﬁnding can be treated in terms of the thermodynamic in-
stability of an i-s-bone approximated by a convex shell of characteristic size
Lis with ﬁxed ends subjected to deformation of ﬂexure His. The free energy
of the shell (a diﬀerence between the elastic energy and the work of defor-
mation produced by some uniform external peak pressure p(crit)) shows its
instability when p(crit) ≈ E(H (max)

Besides the critical force F (crit)
bend due to a perpendicular load that a rigid beam
can withstand without breaking that was already cited by Hokkanen (1986)
and by Selker and Carter (1989, see (11) and (4), respectively), we have
included a corresponding torsional force F (crit)
tors . An estimate for the latter
immediately follows from the critical torsional angle of a slightly bent and
twirled rod considered by Landau and Lifshits (1989). For the critical tor-
sional moment along the rod axis, one therefore has F (crit)
tors Dis = 8.98EIis/Lis
that results in the scaling given in (5).

Although the importance of bending and torsional critical loads in the
production of peak bone stresses is well established (Rubin and Lanyon, 1982,
Biewener, 1982, Biewener and Taylor, 1986, Selker and Carter 1989), we
have demonstrated a natural property of elasticity of bones, similar to the
geometric-shape similarity, in a certain way does not depend on details of
the local bone geometry and bone-end boundary conditions, i.e. all possible
elastic-force scaling (similarities) follow from (4). The elastic-force bending-
torsional scaling given in (5) provides the corresponding critical-force con-
straint 3d − l = a, that in combination with the modiﬁed cylindrical-shape
constraint 2d + l = b results in the relevant bending-torsional criterium for
eﬀective-bone evolution, namely

d(bend) =

As seen from (6), within the context of the hypotheses adopted by McMa-
hon (1973) one has d(bend)
= 1/2 that was
denominated as a static stress similarity (McMahon (1975b). Remarkable
that both the elastic-force criteria, given in (3) and (6) show a consistence
with the isometric solution. For this speciﬁc case, the muscle subsystem de-
velops independently (b0 = 1) and isometrically (a0 = 2/3) and both the
critical elastic forces scale to mass as F (max)
∝ M 2/3 regardless of the under-
lying bone-structure protecting mechanism against critical buckling, bending
or torsion deformations (see similar discussion by Selker and Carter, 1989).

Let us test the predictions for the bone-diameter d(pred) and l(pred) growth
exponents given in (3) and (6) with those known from the one-scale (overall
small and large mammals) bone allometry and those available in the liter-
ature data on a(exp) and b(exp). For the case of a constraint, an estimate
for the overall mammalian data, including birds, on muscle-area allomet-
ric exponent obtained among others by Alexander (1977), Alexander et al.,
(1981), and Pollock and Shadwick (1994), i.e., a(exp)
m = 0.77 − 0.83, was pro-
posed by Garcia (2001). The most recent data on the i-bone-mass allometric
mammalian exponents b(exp)
by Christiansen (2002) are presented in the last
column of Table 1, and the relevant long-bone mammalian exponent b(exp)
(= Σ4
/4) can be introduced with accounting for statistical error due
to distinct regressions, approximately, by b(exp) = 1.0 − 1.1. In Fig.1 we give
a comparative analysis for the distinct bone-evolution scenarios predicted by
the elastic-force buckling (area 1) and bending-torsional criteria (area 2), on
the basis of (3) and (6), respectively, with the help of the aforegiven experi-
mental data a(exp) = a(exp)
and b(exp). The modiﬁed and improved cylindric-
shape and elastic-force constraints are shown by solid lines for the limiting
data a(exp) and b(exp) and the dashed lines and open points correspond to the
simpliﬁed constraints by McMahon. In general, one can see that the long-
bone allometry data on mammalian eﬀective (all-bone-averaged) exponents
by Biewener (1983), Bertram and Biewener (1992, reestimated by Garcia,
2001), and Christiansen (1999a) are close to both the elastic-force criteria.
An exception although should be made for the pioneering data by Alexander
et al. (1979a), where dispersion due to phylogenetic spectrum of terrestrial
mammals was not reduced (see discussion by Christiansen, 1999b).

The elastic-force similarities are tested through the predicted eﬀective-
bone mammalian exponents a(pred), related to the muscle-area exponents,
found as certain predictions given by the elastic-force buckling and bending-
torsional constraints , respectively: a(buckl) = 4d(exp) − 2l(exp) and a(bend) =
3d(exp) −l(exp). As follows from the analysis elaborated in Table 1, the overall-
bone predictions for a(buckl) and a(bend) are, respectively, wedged between 0.89-
0.97 and 0.81-0.87. With taking into account that a(exp)
is limited by 0.83,
we infer that the predicted data based on (i) that the elastic buckling force
given in (1) and those for (ii) long bones ﬁbula and ulna (treated by the RMA
regression method) contradict to muscle-area allometry and therefore should
be excluded from the critical-force evolution scenario. The ﬁrst statement
is discussed in (4) and the second is in line with the notes by Christiansen
(1999a, 1999b) that “ too thin ulna” and greatly reduced ﬁbula ” do not have
”any importance in support of body mass”. In the special case of carnivore’s
ulna, however, provides a substantial forelimb support (Christiansen, 1999a).
As follows from analysis given in Table 1, the overall-bone (LSR method)
prediction for the muscle-area exponent is a(bend) = 0.81-0.83, which coin-
cides with the critical-muscle-force exponent a(exp)
cm = 0.81-0.83 provided by
muscle-ﬁber allometry data by Pollock and Shadwick (1994) reanalyzed re-
cently by Kokshenev (2003). This ﬁnding implies that the statistical analysis
of the elastic-force criteria based on the equation F (max)
is related
to the peak-area muscles and should therefore exclude muscle ﬁbers with
relatively small cross-sections. This can be exempliﬁed by common digi-
tal extensors which have the lowest ”maximum” area and exhibit isotropic
evolution with a(exp)
m ≈ a0 = 2/3, as shown in Fig.1 by Kokshenev (2003).
Finally, let us estimate the aforementioned length-to-diameter eﬀective bone
exponent λ(bend) = (3b(pred) − 2a(pred))/(b(pred) + a(pred)) predicted with 4-bone
exponents b(pred) = 1.03-1.06 and a(pred) = 0.81-0.83 obtained in Table 1.
This provides λ(bend) = 0.77-0.83 that corroborates the allometry exponent
λ(exp) = 0.781-0.810 derived by Kokshenev (2003) from the relevant data by
Christiansen (1999b).

To summarize, we have revised McMahon’s elastic similarities that have
long been a controversial subject of intensive study in the last three decades,
especially in the long-bone allometry for terrestrial mammals. The elastic-

8

force and cylindrical-shape bone evolution constraint equations were not sup-
ported experimentally, and we have therefore reconsidered the basic hypothe-
ses of the approach by McMahon (1973). As a matter of fact, exploration of
the long bone allometric data was commonly given within the framework of
model simpliﬁcations such as (i) the skeletal subsystem of animals operates
separately from the muscle subsystem and (ii) the bone stresses are induced
solely by gravity (Rashevsky, 1948, McMahon, 1973). These contradict to
the observed evolution of bone mass and ignores a role of muscle contrac-
tions in formation of peak skeletal stresses. McMahon’s description of the
cylindrical-shape and elastic-force similarities implicit in the bone dimen-
sional constraints is revised, modiﬁed and extended in view of the up-to-date
knowledge on the bone-mass and muscle-area scalings and on domination of
the bending-induced deformations.

Unlike the case of McMahon’s (1973) elastic similarity model, the elastic-
force (buckling-deformation) and cylindrical-shape similarities modiﬁed by
muscle-area and bone-mass evolution (shown by shaded area 1 in Fig.1) be-
come closer to almost all cited experimental data. At the same time, the
most accurate data by Christiansen (1999a, 1999b) conﬂicts with the mod-
iﬁed elastic-buckling bone evolution scenario. Further improvement of the
elastic-force similarity by critical bending and torsional deformations made
it eventually observable (see shaded area 2 in Fig.1). Statistical analysis
of the allometric data by Christiansen (1999b, 2002) corroborates, at least
in the case of the standard LSR method, the proposed description of the
geometric-shape and elastic-force mammalian similarities given in terms of
the corresponding constraints within the cylindrical-shape and elastic-rod
model approximations.

corresponding correlation coeﬃcient by Christiansen (2002). The muscle-
area ai and the bone-mass bi exponents are predicted with the help of the
elastic-force buckling-deformation (ai = 4di − 2li) and bending-deformation
(ai = 3di−li) constraint equations, and cylindrical-shape constraint equation
(bi = 2di+ li). The eﬀective n-bone mammalian allometric exponents are
given through the mean values of n corresponding exponents, e.g., a =
n−1Σn

FIGURE CAPTURES

Fig.1. Mammalian bone-dimension evolution diagram: diameter against
length. Solid lines are given by the elastic-force a-constraint buckling (4d −
2l = a) and bending (3d − l = a) equations, and for the cylindrical-shape
constraint (2d + l = b) equation. Dashed lines - the same for the case of
a = b = 1. Points: (open squares) 0, 1 and 2 correspond, respectively, to the
isometric (1/3, 1/3), the elastic similarity (3/8, 1/4), and to the stress simi-
larity (2/5, 1/5) models by McMahon (1975b); closed circles symbolized by
A’79, B’83, B’92 and C’99 are due to one-scale, overall-bone-averaged, least-
square-regression data on the mammalian long-bone allometry by Alexander
et al.
(1979a), Biewener (1983), Bertram & Biewener (1992, reestimated
by Garcia, 2001), and Christiansen (1999a), respectively. Statistical error is
shown by bars. Dashes areas 1 and 2 correspond to the proposed criteria
given by the predictions d(buckl), l(buckl) and d(bend), l(bend) in, respectively, (3)
and (6) for the case of the overall muscle areas with a(exp)
m = 0.77 − 0.83 (by
Garcia, 2001) and bone masses with b(exp) = 1.0 − 1.1 (from Table 1).

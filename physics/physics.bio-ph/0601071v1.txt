Abstract

We consider an exactly tractable model of the Kramers type for the voltage-dependent
gating dynamics of single ion channels. It is assumed that the gating dynamics is
caused by the thermally activated transitions in a bistable potential. Moreover, the
closed state of the channel is highly degenerate and embraces the whole manifold
of closed substates. Opening of the ion channel is energetically prohibited from
most of the closed substates and requires a special conformation where the voltage
sensor can move along an activation pathway and trigger the transition into the
open conformation. When the corresponding activation barrier towards the chan-
nel’s opening is removed by the applied voltage, the statistics of non-conducting
time intervals become strongly inﬂuenced by the conformational diﬀusion. For the
corresponding supra-threshold voltages, our model explains the origin of the power
law distribution of the closed time intervals. The exponential-linear dependence of
the opening rate on voltage, often used as an experimental ﬁt, is also reproduced
by our model.

1 Introduction

Ion channels present complex protein structures embedded across the biolog-
ical cell membranes thereby forming the ion-conducting, selective nanopores
[1]. The conformational dynamics of these special proteins, which is known
under the label of gating dynamics, results in the spontaneous openings and

closures of ion channels [1]. In the simplest case, this gating dynamics has
the “all-or-none” character and can be symbolized by the following kinetic
scheme,

Accordingly, the conductance of ion channel ﬂuctuates stochastically between
some ﬁnite value and nearly zero. In the case of voltage-dependent ion chan-
nels, like a delayed rectiﬁer potassium channel, or a Shaker K+ channel, the
opening rate, ko(V ), and the closing rate, kc(V ), are both dependent on the
applied voltage V .

The invention of the patch clamp technique [2] enables one to observe the cur-
rent and the conductance ﬂuctuations in real time with a resolution on the level
of single ion channels. Moreover, the study of the statistics of dwelling time-
intervals becomes feasible. As a matter of fact, the patch clamp experiments
with single ion channels pioneered the whole area of single molecular research.
The gating dynamics of an ion channel with one closed and one open states,
as seen visually in the patch clamp recordings, can be characterized by the
probability densities of closed, fc(t), and open, fo(t) dwelling time-intervals.
The experimental studies reveal that in many ion channels the distribution of
open dwelling times is approximately exponential, fo(t) = kc exp(
kct). How-
ever, the distribution of closed time intervals fc(t) frequently involves the sum
of many exponentials, λi exp(

λit), i.e.,

with weights ci,obeying
i=1 ci = 1. The rationale behind this ﬁtting proce-
dure is the assumption that the closed state consists of N kinetically distinct
discrete substates separated by large potential barriers. The gating dynam-
ics is then captured by a discrete Markovian kinetic scheme with the rate
constants determined by the Arrhenius law.

P

Such an approach presents nowadays the standard in the neurophysiology [3].
An essential drawback of it is, however, that the number of closed substates
needed for agreement with the experimental data can depend on the range of
applied voltages and temperatures used in the experiment. For example, the
experimental gating dynamics of a Shaker potassium channel has been reason-
ably described by a sequential 8-state Markovian scheme with 7 closed states
for a temperature about T = 20 oC [4]. However, when the same research
group extended later on their model to embrace the small range of tempera-
20 oC, three additional closed states have been introduced [5]. This
tures 10

“proliferation” of the number of discrete states, required for the consistent de-
scription of experimental data, is rarely addressed within the approach based
on a discrete Markovian description.

Moreover, it may happen that for some channels the closed time distribution
can be more conveniently ﬁtted by a stretched exponential [6], or by a power
law dependence [7,8,9] with a few parameters only. This observation gave
rise to the so-called fractal models of the ion channel gating dynamics such
as put forward, by example, by Liebovitch et al. [6]. The diﬀusion models
introduced by Millhauser et al. [7], L¨auger [10] and Condat and J¨ackle [11]
are intrinsically based on the concept of dynamical conformational substates
in proteins, an idea which has been pioneered by Frauenfelder et al. [12]. The
diﬀusion models serve as a microscopic justiﬁcation for the fractal modeling.
On the other hand, the discrete diﬀusion models yet present Markovian models
with a large number of states. The non-Markovian, fractal behavior emerges
from the projection of a full Markovian dynamics onto the subspace of two
observable states as symbolized by the kinetic scheme (1).

Alternatively, the discrete diﬀusion can be replaced by the continuous diﬀu-
sion on a potential landscape. Then, the distinct minima of this landscape,
separated by substantial potential barriers, correspond to the discrete states
in the mainstream approach. However, it may happen that, depending on the
applied voltage, some of the distinct barriers disappear. Then, the new fea-
tures of gating dynamics come into the play, which are inevitably missed in
the discrete modeling. It seems therefore that a compromise between the dis-
crete Markovian schemes and a continuous conformational diﬀusion approach
is called for [13,14]. Especially, the continuous diﬀusion models, if set up suf-
ﬁciently simple to allow an analytic treatment, are capable to provide a new
insight into the problem of ion channel gating. In the present work, we reﬁne
and justify further the approach put forward in Ref. [14].

2 Model of gating dynamics

To start, let us consider the model depicted in Fig. 1. Its central element
is the voltage-dependent transitions in a bistable, piecewise linear potential
along the x-axis, see l.h.s. in Fig. 1. This bistable potential corresponds to the
motion of the so-called voltage sensor. The voltage sensor presents a functional
part of the ion channel machinery which changes its position in response to
the changes in the transmembrane potential. In accord with the current view
[1], the voltage sensor is formed by the system of four positively charged S4
13 e0, where e0 is the
α-helices which carry a total gating charge q
positively-valued, elementary charge. When x = 0, the voltage sensor is in its
resting position; when x = x0, the voltage sensor is fully activated and the

two-dimensional conformational space for the gating dynamics. The x-axis corre-
sponds to the voltage sensor degrees of freedom and the y-axis to the conformational
diﬀusion. Note that only the y = 0 cross-section, U (x, 0), of the two-dimensional
conformational potential U (x, y) possesses a bistable character. For y
δ exceeding
some small δ-vicinity of y = 0, the y = a = constant cross-sections, U (x, a), are
essentially monostable, exhibiting sharp minima at x = 0. Moreover, the potential
U (0, y) is ﬂat in the y-direction. These features allow one to simplify the picture
of a two-dimensional reaction state space to the case of one-dimensional reaction
coordinate (see the right part in the ﬁgure) as described in the text.

complete gating charge is moved across the membrane. Moreover, the drop
V of the transmembrane electric potential is assumed to occur linearly on
the characteristic length x0 which corresponds to the eﬀective width of the
cellular membrane within the region of the gating charge translocation. Then,
the energy barriers, Uo(V ) and Uc(V ), follow as

where r := xB/x0. Furthermore, Vc in (3) corresponds to the threshold value
of the voltage V when the activation barrier towards the channel opening
vanishes and U (0)
in (4) is the corresponding height of the activation barrier
towards the channel closing. Note that for V > Vc, Uo(V ) is negative, but
Uc(V ) has always a large positive value, since one assumes that U (0)
is large
r << 1. These assumptions correspond to the experimental observa-
and 1
tions that the closing rate has a very strong dependence on the temperature
and it is less voltage-sensitive than the opening rate [1]. Furthermore, one as-
sumes that the voltage sensor located at the position x > xB (xB corresponds

to the top of the activation barrier for the sub-threshold voltages, V < Vc)
triggers the conformation change in the activation gate. This latter confor-
mational change then leads to the channel opening. It is worth to notice that
in accord with the reasoning in [15,16], the activation gate is likely formed
by the bundle of the intracellular ends of inner, pore-lining S6 α-helices [1].
The motion of the voltage sensor creates an indirect mechanical torque on the
activation gate. This torque is mediated by other structural elements of the
channel protein. For this reason, the link between the voltage sensor and the
activation gate may be ﬂexible and this circumstance can introduce a kind of
mechanical hysteresis. Namely, the closure of the activation gate does not oc-
cur immediately, when the voltage sensor crosses the border at x = xB in the
back direction, but rather requires that (is most probable when) the voltage
sensor is fully returned to its resting position at x = 0. For this reason, by
calculating the dwelling time distribution fc(t) we assume the initial condition
for the probability density P (x, t) in the form P (x, 0) = δ(x), i.e., each and
every closing time-interval starts when the voltage sensor has fully returned.
This inevitably presents an approximation to the reality. In accord with the
general activation theory of Kramers [17], we also have to impose an absorbing
boundary at x > xB. The most natural choice for this is x = x0. However, in
view of our model assumption U (0)
kBT one can safely move the absorb-
ing boundary to x = xB, i.e., P (xB, t) = 0 at all times t
0. The reason
≥
x0 leading to the opening is very
for this is that the ﬁnal transition xB →
quick. The same is assumed in many discrete Markovian schemes [1]. Given
this assumption, the duration of this ﬁnal step is negligible in calculating fc(t).
Furthermore, in order to ﬁnd the distribution of open times, fo(t), one should
put the reﬂecting boundary at x = x0 and the sink (absorbing boundary) at
x = 0, in accord with the above discussion.

c ≫

The next important element of our model is the assumption that the voltage
sensor can operate only if the protein acquires a special pre-open conforma-
tion. Otherwise, its motion is energetically prohibited due to the steric factors.
To account for this type of behavior we introduce the additional, “perpendic-
ular” conformational reaction coordinate y, see l.h.s. in Fig. 1. It describes
the conformational diﬀusion. One assumes that the corresponding dynamics
is only weakly voltage-dependent and we shall neglect the accompanying re-
distribution of charges in the protein molecule. Actually, this conformational
diﬀusion should occur in a hierarchically arranged, ultrametric conformational
space [12,18,19]. In a simpliﬁed manner, one can model this hierarchical fea-
tγ.
tures by a random walk with the mean-squared displacement
This latter relation holds, strictly speaking, if the diﬀusion is unbounded in
space. The bounded character, however, is important for the following. We
restrict ourselves in this paper to the case of normal diﬀusion, γ = 1, as the
simplest possibility. Finally, within this outlined picture one can “convert”
the dynamics along the y-axis into the dynamics along the x-axis, by use of
L, 0] there, see r.h.s in Fig. 1, whereby introducing the aux-

iliary diﬀusion length L and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = kBT /η. Here, η is
the viscous friction coeﬃcient characterizing the conformational dynamics. In
order to account for the bounded character of the conformational diﬀusion,
we impose the reﬂecting boundary condition ∂P (x,t)
L for
all t. Note that η should generally depend exponentially on the temperature,
i.e.

|x=−L = 0 at x =

∂x

η = η0 exp(ǫ/kBT ),

where ǫ is a characteristic activation energy for transitions between conforma-
tional microstates. It can be in the range of several kBTroom. The parameters
D and L are conveniently combined into the single parameter – the confor-
mational diﬀusion time, i.e.,

τD = L2/D

exp(ǫ/kBT )/kBT,

which constitutes an important parameter of the theory.

Note that the functional form in Eq. (12) is nothing but the familiar exponential-
linear dependence used as a phenomenological experimental ﬁt in the cel-
ebrated paper by Hodgkin and Huxley [20] used to describe the voltage-
dependence of the opening rate of a single gate in the potassium channels.
This form is commonly used to parameterize the opening rate of the potas-
sium channels, see, e. g., in [21]. Our model provides a detailed justiﬁcation
for this experimental result. Its remarkable feature is that the dependence
of the rate on voltage is exponential for V < Vc, when the energy barrier
towards activation of the voltage sensor is essential, kBT < Uo(V ). This expo-
nential voltage-dependence implies in virtue of (5) an exponential dependence
on temperature as well, i.e.,

This exponential temperature dependence has two sources: a ﬁrst one is due
to the activation barrier of the voltage sensor Uo(V ), while a second one is

meV, rq = 10 e0 and a room temperature kBTroom = 25 meV one obtains
Uo(Vr) = 20 kBT for the cell resting potential Vr =
90 meV. Furthermore,
when the activation barrier Uo(V ) vanishes for V > Vc, it follows from (12) that
the rate ko(V ) exhibits the linear dependence on voltage, i.e., ko(V )
Vc).
In this case, its temperature dependence is distinctly reduced and becomes
mainly determined by the activation barrier ǫ of the conformational diﬀusion.
The latter one can assume a few kBTroom only. The very diﬀerent temperature
dependences of the opening rate for V
Vc and for V > Vc present an
interesting feature of our model which calls for an experimental veriﬁcation.

It is worthwhile to notice that the discussed crossover from an exponential

the conformational diﬀusion does not play a dominant role. The discussed
feature is caused by the vanishing of the activation barrier Uo(V ) for V > Vc.
However, the distribution of closed time-intervals fc(t) depends qualitatively

perimental data for the delayed rectiﬁer K+ channel from a neuroblastoma
×
glioma cell by use of Eq. (2) with 6 exponentials. This ﬁtting procedure is taken
from Ref. [8] (see, Table 4 therein) and implicitly corresponds to a discrete
Markovian scheme with 6 closed substates. Both results describe well the in-
termediate power law trend and the exponential tail of the closed time-interval
distribution. Nevertheless, some small distinctions can be distinguished.

The plot of the logarithmic derivative, d log fc(t)/d log t, versus the logarithm
of time t in Fig. 3 renders these distinctions much more visible. The advantage
of such a representation as in Fig. 3 is – in accordance with the reasoning in
Ref. [19] – that the hierarchical, tree-like relaxation dynamics reveals itself by
logarithmic oscillations around the level line that corresponds to the power
law trend. Remarkably enough, the exponential ﬁt from Ref. [8] does exhibit
such logarithmic oscillations, cf. Fig. 3. Thus, this result seems to support the
hierarchical character of the conformational dynamics. Our simpliﬁed model
does not distinctly display these ﬁne features as these are rooted in the dis-
crete nature of hierarchical states. Nevertheless, the power law trend, which
reveals the presence and the importance of the conformational dynamics, is
reproduced by our model. Moreover, its appealing feature is that it requires
only few parameters which possess a clear physical meaning. The particular

9

3/2 corresponds to the conformational dy-
value of the power law exponent
namics modeled as a bounded normal diﬀusion. Other power law exponents,
also seen experimentally [9], require a generalization of our model to the case
of anomalous diﬀusion. Such corresponding work is presently in progress.

4 Summary and conclusions

We herewith have presented a simple model of the complex gating dynamics
in voltage-dependent potassium ion channels. It is based on the concept of
conformational diﬀusion. In particular, we assumed that the conformational
change leading to the opening of ion channel is triggered by the voltage sensor
which, in its turn, is permitted only when the channel protein acquires a special
pre-open conﬁguration. When the ion channel is closed, it exhibits an inter-
nal, conformational diﬀusion over the manifold of conformational substates
which do not possess a sensitive voltage dependence. In a simpliﬁed manner,
this conformational diﬀusion has been mathematically modeled by bounded
normal diﬀusion. Moreover, it has been assumed that the open conformation
of the channel is more ordered, with less conformational substates. Then, the
conformational diﬀusion does not play an essential role. In the language of
statistical thermodynamics this means that the ion channel upon opening un-
dergoes a kind of ordering transition into a state with lower conﬁgurational
entropy.

We should also stress here that our simple model is aimed not to replace the
standard discrete Markovian modeling [3], but rather to complement these
eﬀorts by highlighting some basic physical features which otherwise become
blurred with the standard approach. In particular, it has been shown that the
transition from an exponential to linear voltage dependence of the opening rate
occurs when the activation barrier for the voltage sensor towards the channel’s
opening vanishes due to the applied transmembrane voltage. Moreover, if the
conformational diﬀusion time τD exceeds largely the mean duration of closed
Tci
, the closed time distribution exhibits a power law feature
time intervals
h
2/τD ≪
τD. This power law changes
on the intermediate time scale
over into an exponential tail for times t > τD. These features are seemingly
consistent with the experimental observations for some K+-channels. The true
physical benchmark of our model is, however, the prediction that the opening
rate will become much less temperature-dependent for supra-threshold volt-
ages. The weak temperature dependence in this latter regime should correlate
with a weak voltage dependence. This distinct prediction calls for an experi-
mental veriﬁcation, which hopefully will support our reasoning for the gating
dynamics in ion channels.

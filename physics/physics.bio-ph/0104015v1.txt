Geometric and statistical properties of the mean-ﬁeld HP model, which takes the hydrophobicity
of the residues to be the main driving force for early protein folding, and the LS model, which
takes steric repulsion on the residues to be the most important folding interaction, are studied. It is
shown that the two models have almost identical mathematical structures. The mechanism leading
to the previously reported result that the most foldable peptides in the mean-ﬁeld HP model have a
high similarity to binarized peptide sequences that code for α-helices in real proteins is examined in
detail and the result is conﬁrmed. This study supports the view that hydrophobicity plays a major
role in the early formation of α-helices in proteins, but does not support the view that steric eﬀects
play a similar role.

I. INTRODUCTION

The unraveling of the complex structure of proteins
is a great challenge in science.
It is believed that the
dynamical folding process and stable structure, or na-
tive conformation, of a protein are determined by its pri-
mary structure, namely its amino acid sequence [1]. A
number of coarse-grained models have been advanced to
provide insight to these very complicated issues. One is
the HP model proposed by Dill et al. [2], in which the
20 kinds of amino acids are divided into two types, hy-
drophobic (H) and polar (P). This model has been stud-
ied extensively by several groups in the last decade [2–7].
One of the important results from numerical studies of
the model on lattices is that there are a small number
of structures with exceptionally high designability. A
highly designable structure is one that attracts a large
number of protein sequences to choose it as the ground
state. These highly designable structures are found to
have protein-like secondary structures [3,5,6].

Another one is the LS model proposed by Micheletti
et al. [8]. Similar to the HP model, it divides the 20
kinds of amino acids into two types, large (L) and small
(S), but unlike the HP model, it assumes the deciding
factor in folding to be the steric hindrance eﬀect which
depends on the size of the amino acids [8]. It was shown
in ref. [8] that on a lattice, structures in the LS model
too have uneven designability (there called encodability
score); only a small portion of structures, also claimed
to have protein-like secondary structures, are selected
by large numbers of peptide sequences as unique ground
states. It will be shown here that the LS model is math-
ematically equivalent to the mean-ﬁeld HP model.

In [6] the designability problem of the mean-ﬁeld HP

model was reduced to a geometric problem. Here the con-
nection between geometrical constraints and designabil-
ity on the lattice is studied in detail. Highly foldable
(binary) peptides in the two models, namely those pep-
tides that choose highly designable structures as ground
states, are then compared with protein sequences in data
banks.
It is found that, as expected, when the highly
foldable peptides are thought of as pure mathematical
objects, namely binary sequences pure and simple, then
such peptides in the HP and LS models have a high sim-
ilarity with each other. However, when the highly fold-
able peptides are thought of as representations of protein
sequences, which in the HP (LS) model maps the digit
0 to P-type (L-type) residues and the digit 1 to H-type
(S-type) residues, then the highly foldable peptides in
the HP model match well with real protein sequences
in general and with segments of sequences that fold to
α-helices in particular (but not well with segments of se-
quences that fold to β-sheets), whereas those in the LS
model match poorly with real protein sequences.

While in this paper attention is focused on the HP and
LS models on two-dimensional lattices, the method used
can be applied to other models in more general settings.

II. THE HP MODEL

The Hamiltonian of the HP model is:

H =

Epipj ∆(~ri − ~rj )

(1)

i<j
X

where pi is the type, H for hydrophobic and P for polar,
of the ith residue, or amino acid, in the peptide chain
[2]; ∆(~ri − ~rj) = 1 if ~ri and ~rj are nearest neighbors in

1

the lattice but not adjacent along the peptide sequence,
and ∆(~ri − ~rj ) = 0 otherwise; Epipj speciﬁes the residue
contact energies that depend on the types of residues in
contact.

(−1, 0, 0) for the original HP model

Several sets of contact energies (EHH , EHP , EP P ) have
been used:
[2],
(−2.3, −1, 0) by Li et al. [5], and (−π, −1, 0) by Buch-
ler and Goldstein [9]. Li et al. suggested that the con-
tact energies should satisfy the following constraints: 1)
compact shapes have lower energies than non-compact
shapes; 2) EP P > EHP > EHH so that hydrophobic
residues are buried as much as possible; and 3) diﬀerent
types of residues tend to segregate, which is a condition
induced by having 2EHP > EP P + EHH [5,10]. In this
work these will be adopted with the modiﬁcation that 3)
is replaced by the additive relation 2EHP = EP P + EHH .
Then the potential simpliﬁes to:

Epipj = −(pi + pj)

(2)

where pi = 1 for H and pi = 0 for P residue [11]. Hence-
forth only structures that correspond to self-avoiding
compact paths on a lattice will be considered.

In an N ×N two-dimensional square lattices, there are
four corner sites with coordination number Nn = 2,
4(N − 2) side sites with Nn = 3 and (N − 2)2 core sites
with Nn = 4. With the exception of the two ends of the
peptide chain, which we ignore, each lattice point has
Nn − 2 contacts. So the Hamiltonian Eq.(1) becomes:

H = −(0 ×

+1 ×

i∈corner
X

Xi∈side

i∈core
X

= −

pi −

pi +

pi

(3)

i
X

i∈core
X

i∈corner
X

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq.(3) is a con-
stant for a given peptide sequence. It is independent of
whatever conformation the peptide resides in and, since
Eq.(3) will only be used here to determine the native
structure of a particular peptide sequence, it will be omit-
ted. The third term means that it is costly to put H
residues in the corner sites. Since it is of order 1/N 2 it
too will be omitted. The Hamiltonian then simpliﬁes to
what is known as the mean-ﬁeld HP model [6]:

H(p, s) = −p · s =

(|s − p|2 − p2 − s2)

(4)

1
2

where p = (p1, p2, . . . , pn), n = N 2, is the binary peptide
sequence and s = (s1, s2, . . . , sn) is a binary structural
sequence converted from a self-avoiding compact path on
the lattice with the assignment: si = 1 (0) if the ith
site of the structure is a core (surface) site. In this new
form the Hamiltonian has an interpretation quite diﬀer-
ent from its original meaning. There it was an expres-
sion of inter-residual interaction. Here in Eq. (4) it is
no longer inter-residual, rather it has the form of a site-
dependent potential. With s2 ﬁxed for a given lattice

and p2 a constant for a given peptide sequence, both are
irrelevant to the determination of the ground state struc-
ture of the peptide. They will be ignored in the ensuing
calculation. The Hamiltonian now reduces to one-half of
|s−p|2 and a neat geometric interpretation for it emerges
[6]. When p and s are viewed as n-component vectors,
this quantity is just the Hamming distance between two
corner points in a unit n-dimensional hypercube.

When the energy matrix elements are not additive,
that is, when EHH = −2 − γ with γ > 0 as was used
in [2,5,9], the model cannot be reduced to the simple
site-dependent form of Eq.(4). The eﬀect of γ is to stabi-
lize the low-lying states in the mean-ﬁeld model further
by increasing the number of H-H contacts.

III. THE LS MODEL

It was shown by Micheletti et al. that in the LS model
the designability (called encodability score by the au-
thors) distribution of structures is similar to that in the
mean-ﬁeld HP model [8]. The Hamiltonian of this model
is

H = −

zi(Γ) · A(z(σi) − zi(Γ))

(5)

i
X

where σi ∈ {L, S}; z(σi) is the maximal number of near-
est contacts without steric repulsion belonging to residue
i; on a square lattice, z(σi) is equal to 1 (2) for L (S)
residues inside the chain, and to 2 (3) for L (S) residues
at chain ends; zi(Γ) is the number of contacts of the
ith residue in a conformation Γ; and A(x) equals to 1 if
x ≥ 0 and −a < 0 otherwise. The Hamiltonian implies
that if the number of contacts of the ith residue is larger
than z(σi), then the contact energy will be increased by
a owing to steric eﬀects.

FIG. 1. (a) The most (third most) designable, (b) the
second most (most) designable and (c) the third (sec-
ond) most designable structures in the mean-ﬁeld HP (LS)
model, respectively, on a 6×6 lattice.

The results in Ref. [8], where a was set equal to ∞,
show that the distribution of designability of structures
in LS model is very similar to that in the HP model. In
fact most of the highly designable structures in one model
are likewise in the other model (see Appendix). The
highly designable structures in the LS model also have

2

protein-like secondary substructure and tertiary symme-
tries. Three among the most designable structures in the
two models are shown in Fig. 1.

Just as practiced in the last section, we consider only
compact structures and neglect the eﬀect of the two end
points on a peptide chain. Table I gives the values of x,
A(x) and Hamiltonian for the two types of residues at
corner, side and core sites on a square lattice. Let o, s
and c denote the number of corner, side and core sites,
respectively; n = o + s + c = N 2 the total number of
sites; and the subscripts L and S denote residue type,
then

H = −sL + 2acL − sS − 2cS

= 2anL − (1 + 2a)sL − 2aoL − nS − cS + oS

For a given peptide sequence, nL and nS are ﬁxed.
First consider the case when the steric repulsion is strong
but ﬁnite, namely, a ≫ 1. Dropping the corner term oS
one gets for a given peptide sequence,

H = −(2a + 1)cS + const. ≈ −2ap · s + const.

(7)

where p and s are the peptide and structure binary vec-
tors deﬁned before, with the exception that in p the digit
0 (1) now stands for L (S). Comparison of this equation
with Eq. (4) reveals that, at least on a square lattice,
the mathematical form of the two models are essentially
identical, provided that here the pair H and P in the HP
model is replaced by S and L, respectively. Since there
is only one scale in either model, the size of a does not
matter so far as it is much greater than unity but ﬁnite.
When a → ∞, as was the case in [8], the term 2acL
in the ﬁrst line of Eq. (6) becomes a constraint that L
residues are prohibited from core sites, namely cL = 0
strictly, and the rest of the Hamiltonian becomes

H = −cS + oL − nL + oS − nS ≈ −p · s + const.

(8)

which again coincides with Eq. (4).

IV. GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE 2D
SQUARE LATTICE

Since Eqs. (4), (7) and (8) reduce the Hamiltonians of
the mean-ﬁeld HP and LS models to the same problem in

geometry, namely one of the Hamming distance between
the two vectors s and p, we now study the space of these
vectors (in the HP model). Consider an N ×N square
lattice with n = N 2 sites. Recall that every structure
is a self-avoiding compact path on the lattice. The set
P of all binary peptides p is then just the set of 2n bi-
nary sequences. Because of geometric constraints, the set
S⊂P of binary structure sequences s is far smaller than
P. For a very rough estimate for the upper limit of the
size of S, consider the construction of compact paths by
random walk on the lattice. At any given point during
the walk after the ﬁrst step, the maximum number of al-
lowed next steps is the coordination number minus one,
which is between 2 and 3. As the number of steps taken
increases, the average number of allowed next steps will
decrease. We take the average number to be 2 up to the
point when the lattice is half full. For a randomly chosen
path, after the lattice is half full, chances are that the
number of allowed next steps will be either one or zero
most of the time. So the number of allowed s’ should be
much less than 2n/2. On a 6×6 lattice this last number is
262144, whereas the size of S is 30408, and the size of P
is 236 = 68, 719, 476, 736. An example of an allowed s on
the 6×6 lattice is shown in Fig. 2 (a). If we think of P as
the set of all the corner points in the n-dimensional unit
hypercube, then the set S is composed of a tiny subset of
corner points. It was shown earlier that the designabil-
ity of an s ∈ S is the Voronoi polytope of s in P; it is
clear what characterizes the designability problem is the
distribution of the contents of S in the unit hypercube.
We now examine how geometric constraints reduce P
down to S. A sequence in P may be viewed as a chain
of 0’s and 1’s connected by n − 1 links of three types,
those connecting 0 and 0 sites, 0 and 1 or 1 and 0 sites,
and 1 and 1 sites, respectively. Let the numbers of such
links be n00, n10 and n11, respectively. The sequence
is partitioned by the 1-0 links into n10 + 1 segments of
contiguous 1’s or 0’s. Whereas the link numbers for a
p are devoid of geometric meaning, that for s are the
consequences of geometric constraints. To illustrate this,
consider the case N > 4 (the surface to core ratio in
smaller lattices are too lop-sided to be of interest). Some
of the simplest constraints that must be satisﬁed by an
allowed s are:

1. An isolated single 0 may only occur at an end of a

path;

2. An isolated single 1 may only either occur at or be

one 0-segment away from an end of a path;

3. Each of the four corners on the lattice belongs to
a 0-segment at least 4 sites long, except when the
corner is an end of a path;

4. For a path having the pattern s = (1 · · · 1) (both the
ends of the path are 1-sites), 2n00 + n10 = 8N − 8
and 2 ≤ n10 ≤ 4N − 12;

3

5. For s = (0010011 · · · 1), 2n00 + n10 = 8N − 9 and

5 ≤ n10 ≤ 4N − 11;

6. For s = (0010011 · · · 1100100), 2n00+n10 = 8N −10
and 10 ≤ n10 ≤ 4N − 10 if N > 6, the last relation
is replaced by 8 ≤ n10 ≤ 4N − 10 if N ≤ 6;

7. For s = (0010011 · · · 0) 6= (0010011 · · · 1100100),
2n00 + n10 = 8N − 10 and 4 ≤ n10 ≤ 4N − 12;

8. For s = (0 · · · 0)

6= (0010011 · · · 0) and 6=
(0010011 · · · 1100100), 2n00 + n10 = 8N − 10 and
2 ≤ n10 ≤ 4N − 12;

9. For s = (0 · · · 1) 6= (0010011 · · · 1), 2n00 + n10 =

8N − 9 and 1 ≤ n10 ≤ 4N − 13.

The ﬁrst two rules are obvious on a square lattice. The
third rule implies that the polar residues tend to accumu-
late around corners. This fortuitously reﬂects a property
of real proteins: the relative abundance of polar residues
on surface areas with large curvatures. Figs. 2 (b) and
(c) illustrate the origin of the fourth rule on a 6×6 lat-
tice. The two structures are both of the type (1 · · · 1),
that is, they begin and end both on core sites. The
dark solid links in the ﬁgures deﬁne “templates” for con-
structing s’ that respectively have the maximum (twelve)
and minimum (two) values for n10. Rules (5)-(8) can be
shown in a similar way. By explicitly applying the above
rules in the selection of s (as opposed to requiring an
s to be a compact self-avoiding path), the total num-
ber of 236 = 68, 719, 476, 736 binary sequences in P is
reduced to a set of 537549 candidate paths which, rel-
atively speaking, is now only slightly greater than the
exact number (30408) of s’ in S. This implies that the
set of rules given above embodies the essence of the geo-
metric requirement that guarantees elements in S to be
compact self-avoiding paths.

FIG. 2.

(a) A structure deﬁned by a compact,
self-avoiding path, which is in turn represented by the
binary sequence (001100 110000 110000 110011 000011
111100). Black (white) discs represent surface (core) sites
coded by the digit 0 (1). In (b) and (c), the dark, solid
links deﬁne “templates” for constructing structures of the
type (1 · · · 1) whose n10 values are 12 and 2, respectively.

V. DISTRIBUTION OF THE ALLOWED
STRUCTURES IN THE HYPERCUBE

Here we show that only a small portion of the struc-
tures in S have large n10. On an N ×N square lattice,
there is a total of 2N 2 − 2N links and N 2 − 1 among

4

them need to be chosen to form a structure. For the
6×6 case these numbers are 60 and 35, respectively. For
the structure shown in Fig. 2 (b), of the total number
of 60 links on the lattice, 28 links are used to deﬁne the
template (that has n10=12) and 17 links, marked by ﬁlled
diamonds in the ﬁgure, are forbidden because they would
form close loops or connect sites which already have two
links. This means that to complete an s from the tem-
plate, one needs to select 35 − 28 = 7 links from among
60 − 28 − 17 = 15 links on the lattice. Hence at most
15
= 6435 s’ with n10 = 12 can be constructed from the
7
template. A similar argument shows that
= 817190
(cid:0)
s’ with n10 = 2 can be constructed from the template
shown in Fig. 2 (c), which has 21 predetermined links.
The ratio 817190 : 6435 illustrates the point that the
number of s’ with high n10 values is much smaller than
the number of s’ with low n10 values.

FIG. 3. The Hamming distances between pairs of all
the 30408 structural sequences on a 6×6 lattice. The
vertical dashed lines indicate the minimal Hamming
distances for diﬀerent ∆n10.

We now give a heuristic argument showing that there
is an approximate relation between the smallest possible
Hamming distance dmin(s1, s2) between two structures
s1 and s2 and the diﬀerence in the n10 values of the two
structures, ∆n10=n10(s1) − n10(s2); for simplicity we as-
sume that n10(s1) > n10(s2). For this discussion we ig-
nore the two end points of the structures, so that (on a
square lattice) all the segments on an s partitioned by
0-1 links have at least two 0 or two 1 digits. We begin
by considering the case when s2=s1. Then both d(s1, s2)
and ∆n10 are zero. Suppose we can generate s2 by swap-
ping the positions of a pair of 0’s and a pair of 1’s in s1
(while keeping in mind that in most cases such an opera-
tion would not give an s; it would give a p that is not in
S). Then d(s1, s2) = 2 and, depending on the position of
the replaced pair of 0’s in s1, ∆n10 = 0 or 2. Any other

pair of s2 and s1 having ∆n10 = 2 will have d(s1, s2) > 2.
Thus dmin(s1, s2) is 2 for ∆n10 = 2. Similarly, if we gen-
erate s2 by exchanging the positions of a pair of 0’s and
a pair 1’s in s1, for example:

(· · · 0111111110 · · · 1000000001 · · ·)
→ (· · · 0111111000 · · · 1001100001 · · ·)

or

(· · · 0111111110 · · · 1000000001 · · ·)
→ (· · · 0111100110 · · · 1001100001 · · ·)

(9)

(10)

then d(s1, s2) = 4 and ∆n10 = 2 (Eq.(9)) or 4 (Eq.(10)).
Again any other s2 and s1 having ∆n10 = 2 or 4
will have d(s1, s2) > 4. Thus dmin(s1, s2) is 4 for
∆n10 = 4. Arguing along this line it can be shown that
dmin(s1, s2) ≈ ∆n10. In Fig. 3, the logarithmic distribu-
tions of the Hamming distances between pairs of s’ with
ﬁxed values of ∆n10 are plotted for a 6×6 lattice. The re-
lation between dmin(s1, s2) and ∆n10 is clearly displayed.
Notice that all distributions peak at a Hamming distance
of 15-20, with the width of the distribution decreasing
monotonically with ∆n10.

with large n10 will be farther away from its nearest neigh-
bors than if it has a smaller n10. This is indeed brought
out in Fig. 4, where each curve plots as a function of n10
the number of neighboring s’ in S within a Hamming dis-
tance RH , averaged over those s’ speciﬁed by n10. It is
seen that so long as RH ≤ 15, s’ with large n10 has far
fewer nearby neighbors (in S) than s’ with smaller n10.
It follows that s’ with large n10 will on average have large
Voronoi polytopes, hence high designabilities. Note that
the approximate proportional relation between ∆n10 and
dmin(s1, s2) is not expected to be limited to square lat-
tices although the proportional constant is expected to
be dependent on lattice type.

In Fig. 5 (a) and (b) the logarithmic designability is
plotted as a function of n10 for a 6×6 square lattice and
a 21-site triangular lattice, respectively. The size of each
disc indicates the number of s’ having the speciﬁc n10
and designability and an open diamond indicates the av-
erage designability of all s’ having the speciﬁed n10. On
the whole the average designability increases with n10 up
to near the maximum n10. For n10 near the maximum
value it appears that the heuristic argument given above
breaks down, probably partly for boundary eﬀects, and
partly because the number of structures with the largest

FIG. 4. Average number of neighboring structures
within diﬀerent Hamming distances RH for a 6×6 lattice.

It has already been shown that the number of s’ with
large n10 is much smaller than the number of s’ with
small n10. Hence the former kinds of s’ will be even more
sparsely distributed in P than the latter kinds. Thus
given an arbitrary s the chances are that most of its
nearest neighbors will have relatively small n10’s. An s

values of n10 is very small (3 for n10 = 14 and 24 for
n10 = 13 among the 30408 s ∈ S on a 6×6 square lat-
tice) so that statistical ﬂuctuations become important.
The designability distributions on several other lattices
were studied and the pattern shown in Fig. 5 persisted.
The result is summarized in Table II, where nmax

maximum n10 and npeak

erage designability occurs, are given for each lattice. In
all the cases npeak

VI. COMPARISON WITH REAL PROTEINS

It has been shown that the mathematical contents of
the mean-ﬁeld HP model and the LS model are essen-
tially identical. The physical (or biological) interpreta-
tions given to the two models are however entirely diﬀer-
ent. The mean-ﬁeld HP model is based on the assump-
tion that hydrophobic residues would congregate in the
core as much as possible. The LS model is based on the
assumption that large residues would be excluded from
the core as much as possible. To see which model is
based on a more correct premise we compare the results
of the two models with real proteins by matching model
peptide sequences against protein sequences culled from
data banks. For either model, the model sequences are
the two sets of sequences among a total 26, 000, 000 ran-
domly sampled 36-word binary sequences that select the
most highly designable and least designable structures,
respectively, on a 6×6 lattice.

We consider the frequency distributions of the set of se-
quences {Pλ|λ = h, l, S, φ, α, β, φ′, α′, β′}, where the sub-
script h denotes the concatenated 27006 peptides mapped
to the 15 most highly designable structures in the mean-
ﬁeld HP model; l, the concatenated 24134 peptide se-
quences mapped to the 1545 least designable structures
in the mean-ﬁeld HP model; S, the concatenated 22789
peptides mapped to the 364 most highly encodable struc-
tures in the LS model [12]; φ, the concatenated protein
sequences in PDB [13], converted to a binary sequences
based on the hydrophobicity of the peptides; α, same as
φ, but includes only segments of protein sequences that
fold to α-helices; β, same as φ, but includes only seg-
ments of protein sequences that fold to β-sheets; φ′, α′
and β′, same as φ, α and β, respectively, except that pro-
tein sequences are converted to binary ones based on the
volume of residues. The ten residues designated polar (P)
are: Lys, Arg, His, Glu, Asp, Gln, Asn, Ser, Thr, Cys
[14] and the ten residues designated as L-type residues
are, in descending order of volume, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Arg,
Lys, Leu, Ile, Met, His and Gln [15]. That the HP and
LS models diﬀer in physical and biological contents is
predicated by the fact that the two lists overlap poorly.
This predication will not change if the cut-oﬀ points of
either or both lists are varied slightly. The sequences P h

and P S will be referred to as the most foldable peptides
in the HP and LS models, respectively.

To compare the sequences, we employ a Cartesian co-
ordinate representation for symbolic sequences [16], here
applied to binary sequences. Let S denote the set of 2l
binary strings σ of length l. Given a binary sequence Pλ
of length L and a string length l (we are interested only
in cases when L >> l), there is the set {f (l)
λ (σ)|σ ∈ S}
of frequencies of occurrence of the string σ in λ. The fre-
quencies may be obtained, say, by counting while sliding
a window l digits wide along λ. The frequency depends
on the ratio of 0 to 1 digits in the sequence. This ra-
tio, rλ, is 0.983, 1.039, 0.553, 0.960, 0.993, 0.720, 0.734,
0.917 and 0.934, respectively, for the sequences Pλ, λ=
h, l, S, φ, α, β, φ′, α′, β′. In order to make a fair compar-
ison of the sequences adjustments need to be made to
compensate for the disparity in the 0 to 1 ratios. For
this purpose we deﬁne a normalized frequency f ′ by

f ′(l)

λ (σ) = (rλ)nσ f (l)

λ (σ)

(11)

where nσ is the number of 0’s in σ. Sequences in the
normalized frequency set {f ′(l)
λ (σ)} now have 0 to 1 ratios
equal to unity.

In what follows we consider only cases when l is even,
l = 2k. Let L be a 2k × 2k lattice with spacing 2−k, and
π be a one-to-one mapping from S to L, π : S → L by:

π(σ) = (x, y) ≡

σk+i · 2−i,

where σ = [σ1, σ2, · · · , σ2k] is a string in S and (x, y) is a
site on L. From the set {f ′(l)
λ (σ)} we deﬁne a normalized
relative frequency distribution of λ on the lattice L:

Figs. 6 and 7 show the distributions F (6)

λ , λ= φ, α,
β and h, and λ= φ′, α′, β′, and S, respectively. In the
ﬁgures, the magnitude of the distribution is coded into
the gray scale shown at the top of the ﬁgures. From
the fact that (b) and (d) in Fig. 6 have their brightest
and darkest regions, respectively, at generally the same
locations, it is evident that P h ((d)), the most foldable
peptides in the HP-model, is closest to P α ((b)), the
sequence that represents α-helix segments in real protein
sequences. In comparison, although (a) looks similar to
(b), it is not so similar to (d). In particular, some of the

6

brightest regions in (a) are dark in (d), and vice versa.
In sharp contrast (c), which represents β-sheet segments
in real protein sequences, is entirely diﬀerent from all the
other distributions in Fig. 6.

Turning to Fig. 7, it is noticed that (d), represent-
ing the most foldable peptides in the LS model, is very
similar to its counterpart in the HP model, Fig. 6 (d).
This is as expected because the mathematical contents
of the two models are essentially identical. On the other
hand, (d) is very dissimilar to (a), which represents all
protein sequences in PDB, but with the residues parti-
tioned according to the LS model. This shows that size
of the residue is not the most dominant factor in protein
structure.

now eight instead of six. This implies that the sequences
Pλ are now examined with a ﬁner resolution. The result
is similar to the l = 6 case: the most foldable peptides in
the HP model closely resemble the α-helix segments of
real protein, while the foldable peptides in the LS model
do not resemble real proteins.

The sequences Pλ may be compared in a more quanti-
tative manner through the overlap of frequency distribu-
tions:

l increases. This is so because the resolving power of the
method increases with l; for suﬃciently large l, the reso-
lution becomes so large that any two sequence that does
not have substantial and extended sequence identity will
have zero overlap. That O(l)
hS has large positive correla-
tion throughout the whole range of l studied is expected
from the mathematical equivalence of the HP and LS
models. In Ref. [8], the parameter a in Eq.(5) was taken
to be inﬁnity to emphasize the steric constraint on the
residues. Here we had done the same just to conform to
Ref. [8]. On the other hand, since in the present study
all the structures are self-avoiding paths on a discrete lat-
tice, the steric constraint caused by the existence of the
backbone is automatically satisﬁed. Therefore, so far as
the intention of the LS model is concerned, a small and
positive, but not inﬁnite, value for a would have suﬃced.

The overlap O(l)

φα (ﬁlled △) is larger than most other
overlaps for much of l’s shown in the ﬁgure. This is con-
nected to a basic fact of proteins: α-helices account for
almost half of the total amount of protein sequences in
PDB. The overlap drops sharply when l≥12 because most
α-helix segments are shorter than 15 residues long [19].
Next in order of magnitude are the overlaps O(l)
αh and
φh (ﬁlled ▽ and •); these have large positive values
O(l)
for the smaller l’s. This reveals that the mean-ﬁeld HP
model provides a coarse-grained description of some fea-
tures of the real proteins and suggests that the basic as-
sumption of the model - that local residue-water interac-
tion is the dominant cause for protein folding - is consis-
tent with the mechanism for the formation of α-helices.
The overlaps decrease with increasing l for the general
reason given above. On the other hand, the negative

8

correlation shown by the negative value of the overlap
O(l)
βh (▽) shows that the same assumption is inconsistent
with what causes the formation of β-sheets. Two of the
obvious reasons are: whereas most β-sheets are buried in
the interior of proteins, the mean-ﬁeld HP model diﬀer-
entiates only surface from core sites but has no means of
inﬂuencing the interior structure of proteins; the stability
of most β-sheets depends on long-range interactions that
are absent in the model.

The negative value of the overlaps between P S and
P φ′,α′,β′ (✷, △ and ✸, respectively) indicates that the
highly foldable peptide sequences in the LS model are
anti-correlated with the real protein sequences for l ≤
6 and uncorrelated for larger l. This conﬁrms what is
already seen in Figs. 7 and 9: that size eﬀect is not the
dominant factor determining the formation of a stable
protein conformation. Finally, the large negative values
of the overlap O(l)
hl ((cid:13)) for all values of l tested simply
verify that the most and least foldable peptides in the HP
model are highly dissimilar however they are compared.

VII. CONCLUSION

The mean-ﬁeld HP model and the LS model were ex-
amined and compared. Both are binary models. The
mean-ﬁeld HP model
favors having hydrophobic (H)
residues congregating in the core of the protein, while
the LS model discourages (when a is ﬁnite) or bars (when
a=∞) large (L) residues from the core. It was demon-
strated that although the two models are expressed in
diﬀerent languages, their mathematical contents are es-
sentially identical when H and P in the HP model are
identiﬁed with S and L, respectively, in the LS model.
However, because these identiﬁcations are not realized in
nature - a half of the ten largest residues are hydrophobic
- the two models describe diﬀerent physics.

In a two-dimensional lattice model, where potential
native conformations are restricted to the set of compact
self-avoiding paths on the lattice, the search for the most
designable structures in both models can be mathemati-
cally reduced to the search for structures with the largest
Voronoi volumes in the n-dimensional unit hypercube. In
a previous paper it was asserted that structures with the
highest designabilities are essentially structures with the
largest number of surface-core switch-backs [3]. Here it
was demonstrated that indeed there is a close connection
between a structure having a large Voronoi volume and a
large number of surface-core switch-backs. The connec-
tion is a property of binary strings and not a property of
the dimensionality of the lattice.

The most designable structures from both models were
compared with binary sequences converted from protein
sequences culled from data banks. The comparison were
made by representing long binary sequences by the set

of frequencies of occurrence of binary strings of a ﬁxed
length. The set corresponding to each sequence was pre-
sented graphically as distribution in a Cartesian represen-
tation (see Eq.(12)) for visual inspection and comparison.
Overlaps of sets were also computed to get a quantita-
tive measure of the similarity of the sequences. It was
observed that, as expected, the most designable struc-
tures from the two models are very similar. However,
when the 0 and 1 digits are given their designated mean-
ings - polar and hydrophobic residues, respectively, in
the HP model and large and small residues respectively,
in the LS model, a diﬀerent story emerges. The most
foldable binary peptide sequences in the mean-ﬁeld HP
model matched well with the α-helix segments of protein
sequences, but poorly with the β-sheets segments of pro-
tein sequences. But those in the LS model do not match
well with any protein sequences.

Because the mean-ﬁeld HP model

is very coarse-
grained, it can be expected to model only early protein
folding. This study suggests that the rough formation of
α-helices and the collapse of proteins into globular shapes
are primarily determined by hydrophobicity, and that
most α-helices are located near the surface of proteins.
The size of the residues does not seem to be an important
deciding factor. That the most designable structures in
the HP model do not look like β-sheets could be the result
of several factors. One is the constraint on the structures
imposed by a square lattice; β-sheets have a preponder-
ance of HP repeats [19] which, contrary to HHPP repeats
that characterize α-helices, are not energetically favored
on a square lattice. Another could be that hydrophobic-
ity is not the dominant factor that causes the formation
of β-sheets; it is known that many motifs of secondary
structure involve hydrogen bonds between residues on β-
sheets that are distant from each other on the primary
structure. A third factor, related to the ﬁrst two, is
that β-sheets are mostly buried in the protein. Since
the mean-ﬁeld HP model treats all core sites the same,
it does not have any mechanism to promote the forma-
If hydrophobicity is indeed the main
tion of β-sheets.
driving force in early folding, then we can better under-
stand why the formation of α-helices and the collapse
would happen on a similar time scale, of the order 10−7s
[20,21], and why it takes ten times longer for the for-
mation of β-sheets, which involves interactions between
residues distantly separated on the primary structure.
This scenario is consistent with the ﬁnding in a recent
statistical analysis of experimental data:
local contacts
play the key role in fast processes during folding [22].

APPENDIX

Here we show how the two lattice models diﬀer by
comparing strings of several lengths that have the high-

9

est and lowest frequencies of occurrence, called the most
and least favored strings, respectively, in the sequences
P h and P S, which are the concatenated sequences of pep-
tides mapped to the group of most designable structures
in the mean-ﬁeld HP and LS models, respectively.
In
Table III, the ﬁrst and sixth columns list such strings.
Strings of diﬀerent lengths are ranked separately by their
normalized relative frequency of occurrence (Eq. (14));
the string with the highest (lowest) frequency is ranked
1 (2l). By deﬁnition, an unfavored string has negative
frequency. Table III shows that the most favored strings
are quite well correlated in the two models but the least
favored strings are not so.
It is seen that the repeats
(0011) are the most favored pattern in both models, long
repeats of 1’s and 0’s are the least favored string patterns
in the HP model and (01) are the the least favored string

repeats in the LS model. The reason for this is clear:
(0011) repeats are the favored pattern in most foldable
structures in both models and each of the (peptide)
strings (0000), (1111) and (0101) is separated from it
by the greatest frame independent Hamming distance.
There is an additional disincentive for a peptide to have
(01) repeats in the LS model. On a square lattice such
repeats do not appear in a structure sequence, hence,
with L-type residues (represented by 0 digits) strictly for-
bidden on core sites (represented by 1 digits), a peptide
string with 01 repeats can only occupy a structure se-
quence composed entirely of surface sites. This gives the
peptide zero binding energy in the LS model. The situa-
tion is diﬀerent in the HP model. There a peptide string
with 01 repeats can occupy a structure sequence with
0011 repeats and non-zero binding energy.

Abstract

We use an instrument combining optical (surface plasmon reso-

nance) and acoustic (Love mode acoustic wave device) real-time

measurements on a same surface for the identiﬁcation of water con-

tent in collagen and ﬁbrinogen protein layers. After calibration of

the surface acoustic wave device sensitivity by copper electrode-

position, the bound mass and its physical properties – density and

optical index – are extracted from the complementary measurement

techniques and lead to thickness and water ratio values compatible

with the observed signal shifts. Such results are especially usefully

for protein layers with a high water content as shown here for col-

lagen on an hydrophobic surface. We obtain the following results:

collagen layers include 70

thick for bulk concentrations ranging from 30 to 300 µg/ml. Fib-

rinogen layers include 50

1 Introduction

Sorption processes at the solid/liquid interface by which (bio)molecules bound

to material surfaces are of interest for biosensors, biomaterials, materials and

surface science. Understanding the three-dimensional organization (includ-

ing density, water content and thickness) of the resulting sorbed ﬁlm and

its evolution during the process is crucial for many applications in these

domains. For biosensors, more speciﬁcally, there is a need to monitor the re-

sponse in real-time and to be able to distinguish contributions coming from

the dry sorbed mass, which is the physical criterion for estimating sensitivity,

and those that should be attributed to eﬀects intimately associated to the

organization, like sorbent-bound water and viscosity for example. While a

wide variety of methods can qualitatively detect the formation of the sorbed

ﬁlm, almost none of them, alone, is quantitative and able to reveal the ﬁlm

organization, and only few can monitor the process in real-time. Scanning

probe microscopies might fulﬁll all these requirements, mainly for submono-

layers sorbed on smooth surfaces [1]. Neutron reﬂectivity [2], XPS [3], mass

spectroscopy and radiolabeling are quantitative techniques able to directly

measure the dry sorbed amount, nevertheless compatible to very diﬀerent

ﬁlm organizations. Of all the direct detection (i.e. label-less) techniques, we

3

have identiﬁed acoustic and optical methods as being the only ones fulﬁll-

ing two fundamental criteria of our measurements: time resolved and in-situ

(liquid phase) measurement of the physical properties of the adsorbed layer.

Various methods of direct detection of biochemical layers have been devel-

oped, either based on the disturbance of an acoustic wave [4] (quartz crystal

microbalance [5] – QCM – and surface acoustic wave devices [6] – SAW)

or of an evanescent electromagnetic wave (optical waveguide sensors [7, 8],

surface plasmon resonance [9, 10] – SPR). While each one of these trans-

ducers provides reliable qualitative curves during protein adsorption on their

functionalized surfaces, extraction of quantitative physical parameters such

as optical index, density, viscosity or water content requires modeling of the

adsorbed layers [11]. The modeling includes multiple parameters which must

be identiﬁed simultaneously: hence the need for the combination of acoustic

and optical detection methods in a single instrument [12, 13, 14, 15].

We here use a combination of Love mode surface acoustic wave (SAW)

device and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to identify values of density,

water content and thickness of surfactant ﬁlms and protein layers (collagen

and ﬁbrinogen) adsorbed on methyl-terminated surfaces This measurement

is necessary when attempting to convert a raw signal as observed at the out-

4

put of a transducer (angle shift for SPR, phase shift for SAW) to the actual

protein mass bound to the surface (which is the physical criterion for estimat-

ing the expected highest possible sensitivity of a biosensor). We furthermore

compare the signals obtained from quartz crystal microbalance with dissipa-

tion monitoring (QCM-D [16, 17]) measurements to that of the SAW and,

based on the results obtained from the analysis of the SAW/SPR combina-

tion, show how SAW and QCM interact diﬀerently with the layer. The QCM

displays a strong sensitivity to viscous interactions with adsorbed layers as

was shown previously [18, 19]. SAW devices are theoretically sensitive to

mass loading, visco-elastic interactions and electrical charge accumulation

on the sensing area [20].

Love mode acoustic waves were chosen for their high mass sensitivity

and their compatibility with measurements in liquid medium [21, 22, 23,

24]. Being based on the propagation of a shear horizontal acoustic wave,

their interaction with the surrounding liquid is minimal. Although bulk

liquid viscosity properties aﬀect the acoustic wave propagation [25, 26], Love

mode SAW has been shown experimentally to be mostly insensitive to surface

viscous eﬀects [27]. While both SPR and SAW sensors display theoretically

similar sensitivities and detection limits, the acoustic sensor is extremely

5

sensitive to temperature variations and care must be taken to properly control

the environment around the instrument to keep the temperature stable [12].

The chosen protein layers consist of collagen and ﬁbrinogen. Collagen is

a ﬁbrillar protein of the extracellular matrix possessing self-assembly proper-

ties, involved in biorecognition processes. The collagen macromolecule con-

sists of a triple helix with dimensions about 300 nm in length and about

1.5 nm in diameter, and weights about 300 kilodaltons. Organization of colla-

gen ﬁlms adsorbed on hydrophobic surfaces – CH3-terminated self-assembled

monolayers (SAMs) and polystyrene – from 30 to 40 µg/ml were fully char-

acterized under water or after drying using AFM, X-ray photoelectron spec-

troscopy and radioassays. By AFM scratching experiments, thickness of

the ﬁlm adsorbed on methyl-terminated surfaces was estimated to be about

20 nm under water and 7-8 nm after drying. Nevertheless, it was found that

the measurement was strongly inﬂuenced at weak applied forces (<0.5 nN),

in relation with the long-range repulsion (

50 to

250 nm) observed by

∼

∼

AFM force-distance curves, strongly suggesting that at least some molecules

of the ﬁlm must protrude into the solution [29]. Adsorbed amount of colla-

gen on methyl-terminated surfaces were estimated to be between 0.4 and 0.8

µg/cm2 by combining AFM and XPS measurements. Values near 0.5 µg/cm2

6

were determined to be adsorbed on polystyrene by radiolabeling of the same

source of collagen as the one used in this study. Fibrinogen, on the other

hand, is a blood protein that presents three globular domains linked together

by ﬁbrilar segments. Similarly to collagen, its molecular weight is about 340

kilodaltons. Fibrinogen adsorbed on various surfaces has been imaged by

AFM as well [30], down to molecular resolution [31, 32, 33].

While the SAW/SPR technique and data processing with our proposed

formalism was already shown to be appropriate in the identiﬁcation of some

physical properties of a rigid adsorbed layer (S-layer) [37], we here quanti-

tatively analyze the organization of collagen and ﬁbrinogen adsorbed layers

which are expected to possess a substantial water content. This condition

is expected to lead to the largest diﬀerences between acoustic and optical

signals since both techniques respond diﬀerently to a viscous (solvent con-

taining) layer: acoustic methods tend to overestimate the bound mass due to

viscous eﬀects, while optical methods provide an estimate of the dry bound

mass after appropriate modeling of the response but cannot resolve both pa-

rameters, thickness and optical index of the layer which SPR is sensitive to.

This optical index can be assumed to be the weighted value of the index of

water and that of proteins to the volumic part that these components occupy

7

in the ﬁlm. SPR response is thus dependent on the ﬁlm organization and on

the dry adsorbed amount.

Unlike the model used in other studies [34], we here assume that the

SAW device signal shift is predominantly due to added rigidly bound mass

on the electrode. Indeed Friedt et al. showed that, while the QCM is sensi-

tive in a viscoelastic way to the surface topography induced by rough copper

electrodeposition [35], SAW is not [27]. Collagen ﬁlms were analyzed using

SAW/SPR after diﬀerent conditionings (drying of the surface after adsorp-

tion and subsequent rehydration), inducing a diﬀerent ﬁlm organization and

related viscoelastic behavior (as probed by AFM and QCM respectively) for

a similar adsorbed amount. These diﬀerences in the ﬁlm properties were

found to result in only minor changes in the SAW response. For all these

reasons, the SAW phase response is considered in this article to be only mass

dependent during adsorption phenomena. Hence, we use a proportionality

relationship between the mass of the layer per unit area (∆m/A) – including

the rigidly bound water – and the frequency shift: ∆m

A = ∆f

S×f0 where f0 is the

frequency at which the phase is monitored in an open-loop conﬁguration, ∆f

is the frequency shift obtained after conversion from phase to frequency shift

through the experimentally measured phase to frequency linear relationship,

8

and S is the mass sensitivity calibrated by copper electrodeposition. Since

the mass sensitivity calibration is a central part in extracting quantitative

results from the experimental data, we conﬁrm the results obtained with

copper electrodeposition by measuring the SAW signal change during ad-

sorption of a surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), whose

surface density upon adsorption on gold is known: from the surface area per

molecule of 50 ˚A2 [36] and the molar weight of 364 g/mol, a mass per unit

area of 120 ng/cm2 is deduced assuming the formation of a monolayer.

2 Experimental section

Instrumentation The combined SAW/SPR instrument developed for per-

forming this experiment has been described previously [37]: a modiﬁed Ibis

II SPR instrument (IBIS Technologies BV, Netherlands) is used to inject a

670 nm laser in a quartz substrate (Kretschmann conﬁguration) and monitor

the reﬂected intensity v.s. angle with an accuracy of

2.555o/200 pixels at

±

two locations separated by about 2 mm on the sensing surface. The ST-cut

quartz substrate is patterned with double-ﬁngers interdigitated electrode for

launching a Love mode acoustic wave at a frequency of 123.5 MHz. The

9

guiding layer is made of a 1.13 µm thick PECVD silicon dioxide layer. The

phase and insertion loss of the acoustic wave device are monitored using an

HP 4396A network analyzer while a custom software records the full reﬂected

intensity v.s. angle SPR curve. The 5

5.5 mm2 sensing area is coated with

×

nominal thicknesses of 10 nm T i and 50 nm Au to support surface plasmon

resonance, and is either grounded to minimize varying salt concentration

eﬀects on the signal measured by the SAW device during biological experi-

ments, or connected as the working electrode during copper electrodeposition

calibration. Both sets of data – SAW phase at a given frequency and SPR

reﬂected intensity curves – are time stamped with an accuracy of 1 second

on the common PC internal clock reference for future processing, which for

the SPR curve involves polynomial ﬁtting for improving 100-fold the accu-

racy on the localization of the minimum. The temperature coeﬃcient of

the Love mode device has been measured to be 34

1 ppm/K, in agreement

±

with values reported in the literature [24], and the insertion loss is in the

-27 dB to -30 dB range when the grounded sensing area is covered by a liq-

uid. Both dual-ﬁngers interdigitated transducers (wavelength: 40 µm) are

protected from the liquid by a 100 µm-high SU8 wall capped with a piece

of quartz forming sealed protective chambers. The sides of the SAW devices

10

are glued to an 7

17 mm opening in a 1.6 mm-thick epoxy (FR4) printed

×

circuit board (PCB) with the bottom area of the SAW tangent to the PCB,

allowing optical contact between the bottom surface of the SAW device and

a cylindrical prism through optical index matching oil (noil = 1.518). After

wire bonding the SAW device to the PCB, the region surrounding the SAW

device is coated with 1 mm wide, 1-2 mm thick epoxy walls using H54 two-

parts epoxy glue (Epoxy Technology, Billerica, MA, USA), forming a 180 to

200 µl open well in which the solution is injected using a micropipette.

Recording all SPR curves of the reﬂected intensity v.s. angle during

the experiment for post-processing is required since the shape of the dip

is unusual (Fig. 1) and cannot be processed properly by the commercial

software provided with the instrument which expects the substrate to be

glass. As seen in Fig. 1 in which the reﬂected intensity v.s. angle curve is

displayed, the periodic dips observed when the gold coated SAW sensor is

placed over the half-cylinder prism in air is attributed to the birefringence

of quartz which is the cause of the interference pattern after reﬂection of

the laser on the metallic surface. The orientation of the quartz substrate

on which the SAW propagates has been chosen on purpose to separate as

much as possible the successive interference minima. The dip due to SPR is

11

identiﬁed when the surface is coated with water, and the position of this dip

only is monitored over time. A typical raw SPR reﬂected intensity v.s. angle

curve is displayed in Fig. 1: the mean incidence angle is about 72

2o (not

±

calibrated in the Ibis II instrument) and the abscissa is graduated in relative

angle shift.

The QCM-D measurements were performed using the electronics supplied

by Q-Sense AB (Sweden) using AT-quartz plano-plano resonators (Chintele

Quartz Technology Co. Ltd, Zhejiang, P.R. China) coated with 10 nm T i

and 50 nm Au, key-hole shaped counter electrode and fully coated sensing

electrode, leading to a fundamental resonance frequency around 4.7 MHz and

a quality factor in liquid around 5500. These experiments were performed

both in a lab-made open cuvette and in the commercially supplied ﬂow cell

(with static liquid during the measurement). Both sets of measurements are

compatible. However, since the QCM setup is distinct from the SAW/SPR

setup, we will not attempt any kinetics comparison between both datasets.

Chemicals and Materials The Cu electrodeposition step was per-

formed using a solution of 10−2 M CuSO4 in 10−2 M H2SO4. The counter

electrode was a 0.25-mm-diameter platinum wire shaped in 3/4 of a circle

and the pseudo-reference electrode was made of a 1 mm-diameter 99.98+%

12

copper wire (Huntingdon, UK), cleaned by brieﬂy dipping in 70% nitric

acid before use. The electrochemical reaction was controlled by a PC3-300

Gamry Instruments (Warminster, USA) potentiostat. Collagen was supplied

by Roche (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) as a sterile acidic

solution of 3 mg/ml solution of collagen type I from calf skin.

It was di-

luted in PBS buﬀer (137 mM NaCl, 6.44 mM KH2P O4, 2.7 mM KCl and

8 mM Na2HP O4) to reach the wanted concentration just prior to use. Type

I ﬁbrinogen from human plasma was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Both

QCM and SAW/SPR Au sensing electrodes were coated with an octade-

canethiol hydrophobic self-assembled layer, leading to a contact angle above

110o. Alkanethiols were self-assembled by dipping the QCMs in a 10−3 M

octadecanethiol (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in ethanol after a 15 minutes clean-

ing step in UV-O3 and rinsing with ethanol. The SAW devices were placed

in a chamber with an ethanol saturated atmosphere, and 150 to 180 µl of the

same thiol solution was deposited on the open well above the sensing area.

Adsorption was subsequently allowed for 3 hours, after which the surfaces

were rinsed with ethanol and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The thiol

solution and later biochemical solutions are only in contact with the chem-

ically inert H54 epoxy glue and quartz slides capping the SAW device and

13

never with the FR4 epoxy and copper of the PCB, thus minimizing risks of

contamination of the solutions and of the sensing surface.

3 Results and Discussion

SAW sensitivity calibration Figure 2 illustrates the calibration procedure

using copper electrodeposition: a cyclic voltametry sweep from +600 mV

to -60 to -100 mV (depending on the mass of copper to be deposited) v.s a

copper wire acting as a pseudo-reference electrode provides an estimate of the

deposited mass, assuming a 100% eﬃciency of the electrochemical process.

A current Ij is monitored by the potentiostat at a sampling rate of 5 Hz, j

being a point number. By selecting the voltage range for which the current

is negative (copper deposition), we obtain the deposited mass by numerical

integration

where F is the Faraday constant (96440 C), δt = 0.2 s is the time interval

between two samples, mCu = 63.5 g/mol is the molar weight of copper and

ne = 2 the number of electrons required for copper reduction. Simultaneously

the phase shift ∆φ of the SAW device due to the added mass is measured

14

and converted to a frequency variation ∆f via the linear phase to frequency

relationship measured on the Bode plot: ∆f /∆φ = 1680

5 Hz/o in our case.

Once the deposited mass is estimated, the SAW sensitivity S is computed

considering the center oscillation frequency f0 = 123.2 MHz, the working

electrode area A and the frequency shift ∆f due to the added mass: S =

∆f
f0 ×

∆m
A , leading to an experimentally measured sensitivity of 165

10 cm2/g

±

for one SAW device and 145

15 cm2/g for another similar sensor (data

±

not shown), the diﬀerence being related to packaging issues and mostly the

inﬂuence of the protective SU8 wall on the acoustic path. Both values were

conﬁrmed with CTAB adsorption on octadecanethiol coated gold at a bulk

concentration of 1.3

10−4 M. In the former case for example, the monolayer

×

formation lead to a frequency shift of the SAW device of 2.5 kHz from which

a surface density of 123 ng/cm2 is obtained. Interestingly, the simultaneously

observed SPR angle shift can only be interpreted with a layer of optical index

at least 1.5, which leads to a layer thickness of 1.5

0.5 nm fully coated with

±

CTAB (no solvent) after simulation using the formalism described in [38]

and following the procedure described in more details later in this article.

The large uncertainty on the layer thickness is related to the low molecular

weight of CTAB leading to a small mass increase which leads to a phase shift

15

of only about 5 times the noise level of the SAW phase. Such a high optical

index is compatible with that provided in the literature for thiol monolayers

as an extension of the optical index of bulk alkane solutions [39]. The surface

mass density is compatible with that observed with QCM-D measurements

following the assumption of a rigid mass, as validated by the good overlap

of curves obtained at overtones 3, 5 and 7 when normalized by the overtone

number, and the low dissipation increase (∆D < 1

10−6).

×

SAW/SPR measurements Once the mass sensitivity of the SAW de-

vice is calibrated, the combined SAW and SPR measurements are used to

monitor protein adsorption and extract the physical properties of the re-

sulting ﬁlms. Collagen and ﬁbrinogen adsorption were performed on methyl-

terminated surfaces of the SAW/SPR device at concentrations of 30 or 300 µg/ml

and 46 or 460 µg/ml respectively. The sequence of solutions brought in con-

tact with the sensing surface was successively PBS (or PBS-water-PBS),

protein in PBS, PBS, water and ﬁnally PBS. Figure 3 displays a typical

signal observed during collagen adsorption on an hydrophobic surface, for

(a) 300 µg/ml and (b) 30 µg/ml bulk concentrations. Immediately after the

conditioning with the collagen solution, both SAW and SPR show a clear

response, reaching after about one hour a clear plateau or a beginning of a

16

plateau, depending on the conditioning collagen concentration. The curved

shapes of the SAW and SPR responses in function of time are characteristic

of a langmuir adsorption isotherm and seem to be qualitatively similar for the

two techniques. In relation to the time required to reach the plateau, the re-

sponse kinetics are also clearly dependent on the collagen concentration used,

the most concentrated solution inducing a faster response, which is expected

from thermodynamics. The SAW and SPR shifts at the end of the adsorp-

tion with a collagen concentration of 30 µg/ml were respectively 17.0

±

±

and 0.39

0.07 o, while a concentration of 300 µg/ml lead to 19.2

0.5 o and

0.65

0.1 o for SAW and SPR respectively. Adding PBS, after collagen con-

ditioning, resulted in very small loss (< 1 o for SAW and < 0.05 o for SPR)

0.7 o

±

±

of the response, stable with time, and subsequent washing by water and PBS

again provoked no signal change. This means that molecules do not desorb

with time once adsorbed on the substrate. The SAW phase shift is converted

to a frequency shift by using the locally linear phase to frequency relationship

as observed on the Bode plot displayed by the network analyzer – in our case

the conversion factor is 1680 Hz/o, and is then translated into a bound mass

thanks to the calibrated sensitivities – in our case 165 g/cm2 or 145 g/cm2

depending on the SAW device being used. The resulting hydrated collagen

17

adsorbed ﬁlms are estimated to weight 1.75

0.15 and 2.10

0.20 µg/cm2 for

±

±

the 30 and 300 µg/ml solutions respectively. Fig. 4 displays a similar mea-

surement on 460 µg/ml ﬁbrinogen. A similar sequence of conditioning steps

as previously presented for collagen were applied. PBS washing results in a

stable loss of response attributable, like for collagen, to a loss of ﬁbrinogen

molecules physisorbed to the adsorbed ﬁlm. There is again no signiﬁcant des-

orption of adsorbed molecules. The observed shifts resulting from ﬁbrinogen

adsorption were 14.0

0.7 o and 0.65

0.1 o for SAW and SPR respectively.

±

±

For SAW, using the same relations as was presented for collagen, the surface

density of the hydrated ﬁbrinogen ﬁlms were estimated to be 0.75

0.1 and

±

1.5

0.3 µg/cm2 for 46 and 460 µg/ml concentrations respectively.

±

QCM-D mesurements Collagen and ﬁbrinogen adsorption were per-

formed on methyl-terminated QCM surfaces following the same conditions

as were used for the SAW/SPR. Changes in resonance frequency and dissi-

pation of the ﬁrst four odd overtones were measured as a function of time.

An example of a QCM-D measurement is presented in Fig. 5 for the same

300 µg/ml collagen as in Fig. 3 (b) but on a diﬀerent setup: both experi-

ments (SAW/SPR and QCM) are based on a lab-made open cuvette in which

200 µl of the new solution is manually injected by a micro-pipette. While the

18

kinetics of the SAW and SPR data can be compared, we will not attempt

to compare it with the kinetics of the QCM since the latter was included

in a diﬀerent setup. We will however see that the asymptotic behavior of

both experiments performed separately lead to the same conclusion, namely

the large amount of water trapped in the collagen layer. Frequency shifts

are presented after normalizing by the overtone number as classically done

when assuming the adsorbed layer to be rigidly bound to the sensing sur-

face, and by the square root of the overtone number as would be expected for

a strongly viscous interaction [35]. The frequency responses of the diﬀerent

overtones do not overlap when normalized by the overtone number while they

do when normalized by the square root of the overtone number, indicating a

predominantly viscous interaction of the QCM with the ﬁlm. Leading to the

same conclusion, the dissipation rises to an enormous value above 100

10−6.

×

Quantitatively, if this ﬁlm was assumed to be a rigid layer, these frequency

shifts would correspond to wet masses in the range 8 to 12 µg/cm2 as obtained

by applying the Sauerbrey relation. These values are far larger than the cor-

responding values deduced by SAW measurements (2.10

0.20 µg/cm2). This

±

points to the fact that SAW measurements are far less sensitive to viscoelas-

tic interactions with the adsorbed ﬁlm than the QCM. All measurements

19

for collagen and ﬁbrinogen adsorptions at the diﬀerent concentrations were

performed and the characteristic results as explained above are summarized

in Table 1. The same conclusion as above can be made in all cases, QCM

measurements denoting a viscoelastic behavior of the adsorbed ﬁlm and the

corresponding wet adsorbed masses being always superior to those deduced

by SAW. Fibrinogen shows less viscoelastic properties than the collagen ﬁlm

and lower protein concentrations result in a less viscoelastic behavior of the

adsorbed ﬁlm.

Physical properties of the layers The observed SAW phase shift moni-

tored at 123.2 MHz thus translates into a surface mass density of 1.75

0.15 µg/cm2

±

and 2.10

0.20 µg/cm2 for bulk concentrations of 30 and 300 µg/ml re-

±

spectively. The SPR angle shift data are modeled following the formalism

developed in [38] in which each component of the electrical ﬁeld is prop-

agated through a stack a planar dielectic interfaces. The optical indexes

of the metallic layers were taken from the literature [42]: 10 nm titanium

with nT i = 2.76 + i3.84 and 45 nm gold layer with nAu = 0.14 + i3.697,

while the optical indexes of the underlying dielectric substrate were taken

as nquartz = 1.518 coated with 1200

100 nm silicon dioxide nSiO2 = 1.45.

While only the last dielectric layer (SiO2) below the metallic layer is neces-

±

20

sary to estimate the position of the plasmon peak, we include the full stack

of planar layers in our simulation in order to include possible interferences

eﬀects. The optical index of the protein nprotein is assumed to be in the

1.45 to 1.465 range [40, 41, 9]. The properties of the protein layer, sup-

posed to be homogeneous, are deduced from the assumption that a weighted

average of its components (water and protein) can be used:

if the ratio of

protein in the layer is x, then the optical index of the layer is assumed to

be nlayer = xnprotein + (1

x)nwater [43] (nwater = 1.33) and its density

ρlayer = xρprotein + (1

x)ρwater (ρwater = 1 g/cm3 and ρprotein is assumed to

−

−

be equal to 1.4 g/cm3 range [44, 11, 40, 41]). The latter value is used in our

simulations. The methodology for extracting the physical parameters of the

protein layers is the following: we ﬁrst simulate the predicted SPR dip angle

shift as a function of layer protein content x and layer thickness d, as shown

in Fig. 6 where we display the SPR angle shift due to the added dielectric

layer formed by the proteins (i.e. dip angle with solvent before adsorption

subtracted from the dip angle after adsorption). We mark on such a plot the

experimentally observed angle shift, which leads to a set of possible

x, d

{

}

couples compatible with the SPR experiment. For each of these set we com-

pute the surface density of the layer d

ρlayer and compare it with the value

×

21

∆m/A = ∆f /(S

f0) experimentally observed with the SAW measurement.

A single set

x, d

is compatible with both the SAW and SPR data. Notice

{

that the resulting mass density d

ρlayer includes the mass of trapped solvent

in the layer.

The result of both SPR and SAW signal can only be compatible with

a water content of the collagen layers in the range 75%

15% for 30 µg/ml

±

concentration (x=0.25

0.15) and 65%

10% for 300 µg/ml (x=0.35

0.1),

±

±

±

with a lower water content for higher bulk collagen concentrations, and cor-

respond to the only set of parameters compatible with the SPR angle shift

and the mass variation observed by the SAW device, assuming a purely rigid

mass eﬀect and negligible viscous interaction. The very high water content

obtained here is conﬁrmed by the large dissipation monitored on the QCM-D.

As was shown earlier by Friedt et al. [35] and by others [18, 19], a large

dissipation shift indicated strong viscous interaction of the vibrating QCM

surface with the surrounding solvent, and is conﬁrmed by the overtone scaling

law ∆fn/√n =constant (as opposed to the expected ∆fn/n =constant for a

rigid layer). One also sees here the strong overestimate of the bound protein

mass if assuming a rigid mass and applying the Sauerbrey proportionality

relationship between mass and frequency shift. The estimated collagen ﬁlm

22

thickness in the 15 to 20 nm range (Fig. 6) is in agreement with AFM

topography maps obtained ex-situ under similar conditions [28].

Table 1 summarizes our measurement results on collagen and ﬁbrinogen

layers following the data processing methodology described in the previous

paragraph. We observe that the parameters extracted from the SAW/SPR si-

multaneous measurements are in good qualitative agreement with the QCM-

D results: a layer leading to a high dissipation increase (∆D > 10

10−6) and

×

an overtone normalization law with the square root of the overtone number

is characterized by a high water content, as seen with collagen. On the other

hand a small dissipation increase and a normalization law of the QCM fre-

quencies with the overtone number are indicative of a low water content and

a layer behaving as a rigid mass bound to the surface, as observed with CTAB

and the S-layer. Fibrinogen is an intermediate case, for which the QCM fre-

quency does not scale well with the overtone number nor with the square root

of the overtone number, and for which the dissipation increase is average. We

indeed ﬁnd a rather low water content for such layers. The uncertainty on

the collagen layer density and hence thickness is large: as opposed to highly

ordered layers such as those formed by self-assembled monolayers of thiols or

by CTAB, we do not expect highly disorganized polymer-like ﬁlms of ﬁbrous

23

proteins to form exactly similar structures from one experiment to another.

The physical properties (water content and hence density and optical index)

results on the other hand are consistent from one experiment to another,

hence the need for the simultaneous measurements at the same location by

both optical and acoustic methods (and eventually additional methods such

as scanning probe microscopy [32]) in order to obtain statistically signiﬁcant

properties of the ﬁlm.

Kinetics analysis We attempt now to provide some hint at diﬀerences

in the kinetics as observed by acoustic and optical methods. We compare

the kinetics as monitored by SAW and SPR by normalizing the response of

the sensor once the saturation level is reached, just after the rinsing buﬀer

step. We thus plot in Figs. 7 (a) and (b) the curves

S(t)
S(tf )

−
−

S(t0)
S(t0)

(1)

where t0 is the adsorption starting time, tf the time at which a saturation

signal has been reached and the protein solution is replaced by buﬀer, while

S(t) is a signal which can either be in our case the SAW phase shift ∆φ

or the SPR angle shift ∆θ. We now ﬁrst analyze the expected behavior of

the normalized quantities of the two signals when assuming a rigid mass

24

interaction and the model presented previously here, and will then discuss

some of the possible causes of deviation from this expected behavior.

If we ﬁrst assume that the SAW signal shift is proportional to the bound

mass – including the trapped solvent – and that the SPR signal is propor-

tional to the added protein quantity, then ∆φ

d

ρ(x) and ∆θ

d

n(x)

∝

×

∝

×

where d is the common layer thickness measured by both techniques. By

introducing these proportionality relationships in Eq. 1, we obtain normal-

ized quantities expressed as ρ(x)−ρ0
ρf −ρ0

for the SAW phase and n(x)−n0
nf −n0

for the

SPR angle, where an f index indicates the value of the quantity at the date

at which saturation is reached and index 0 indicated the beginning of the

adsorption.

If we furthermore assume, as has been done previously in the quan-

titative analysis of the data, that ρlayer = xρprotein + (1

x)ρwater and

−

nlayer = xnprotein +(1

x)nwater, and considering additionally that ρ0 = ρwater

−

and n0 = nwater, we ﬁnally ﬁnd that both normalized quantities express as

x×(ρprotein−ρwater)
ρf −ρwater

and x×(nprotein−nwater)

nf −nwater

. Since both techniques, SAW and SPR,

are probing the same surface, not only do they measure a common layer

thickness but also a common protein to water ratio, so that a common ﬁnal

value xf can be attributed to both nf and ρf , and ﬁnally the two expression

25

simplify and give x×(ρprotein−ρwater)

xf ×(ρprotein−ρwater) = x
xf

for the normalized SAW data and

x×(nprotein−nwater)
xf ×(nprotein−nwater) = x
xf

.

In conclusion of this calculation, we see that following two assumptions

about the proportionality of the SAW and SPR signals with the physical

properties of the layer and the evolution of the physical property of the

protein layer as a function of water content, we reach the same law for the

evolution of the normalized SAW and SPR signals. We test this result by

eliminating the time parameter and plotting the SAW normalized phase shift

as a function of SPR normalized angle shift. We predict that all points should

lie on the line of slope 1. The S-layer data shown previously [37] and the

ﬁbrinogen data displayed in this article do not show any signiﬁcant diﬀerence

in the kinetics as detected by the optical and acoustic methods, and hence

indeed all normalized points fall close to this line. On the other hand the

solvent swollen collagen layer adsorption presented here seems to display a

faster kinetics as detected by the acoustic method as the one detected by the

optical method. Therefore we see in inset of Fig. 7 (a) and (b) that all points

lie above the line of slope 1. Such a graph provides a quantitative relationship

between measurements obtained by acoustic and optical methods.

From the calculation we just presented, we can attribute the discrepancy

26

of the normalized point distribution to either of the two assumptions: either

the SAW signal is not strictly proportional to the bound mass (assumption

∆φ

d

ρlayer) or the simple linear law relating the physical properties of the

∝

×

layer (density and optical index) to the physical properties of the individual

components of the layer – protein and water – is not accurate. In view of

the previously published literature [11, 34], we favor the ﬁrst possibility and

propose a possible contribution of the viscous interaction of the collagen layer

to the SAW signal. We notice though that the discrepancy of the distribution

of normalized points to the line of slope 1 is not important and still consider

the quantitative analysis presented here to be valid.

4 Conclusion

We have shown how a two steps measurement, ﬁrst using copper electrode-

position for instrument calibration followed by a measurement on the actual

biological layer under investigation, on a combined SAW/SPR instrument

leads to an estimate of the water content and layer thickness. While each

individual technique cannot achieve such identiﬁcation, both common pa-

rameters (water content ratio and layer thickness) can be identiﬁed with the

27

combination. Such results are especially useful for protein layers with high

water content for which the viscous interaction can become predominant over

rigid adsorbed mass. We have veriﬁed the calibration process using CTAB,

conﬁrming the 120 ng/cm2 surface density due solely to the densely orga-

nized monolayer, and illustrated the technique with an estimate of the water

content of collagen, leading to a 70%-water/30%-protein result, which is in

agreement with the large dissipation increase (quality factor decrease) ob-

served by QCM-D. Furthermore, QCM-D overtone normalization factor with

such solvent swollen layers is the inverse of the square root of the overtone

number (and not the inverse of the overtone number as would be the case for

a rigid layer). Applying the proportionality factor between QCM frequency

shift and surface mass density as predicted by the Sauerbrey relationship, as-

suming a rigidly bound mass, leads to a strong overestimate of the adsorbed

mass. We have also shown that ﬁbrinogen layers have a water content of

50

10 %, compatible with a lower dissipation factor increase in the QCM-D

±

measurements. Finally, we have discussed the comparison of kinetics as ob-

served by optical and acoustic techniques and propose that the discrepancies

observed in the case of solvent swollen layers might be attributed to minor

viscous interactions of the SAW with the protein layer.

Table 1: summary of the results extracted from simultaneous SAW and

SPR measurements, and comparison with the results obtained from QCM-

D measurements. The “surface density” value is obtained by converting the

phase shift observed on the SAW device monitored in an open loop conﬁgura-

tion to frequency through the linear relationship monitored on the Bode plot,

and the resulting frequency shift to a mass density per unit area by using the

mass sensitivity deduced from the copper calibration. The layer thickness d

and protein content of the layer x are deduced from the simulation of the

SPR shift as a function of layer thickness and optical index (assuming a pro-

tein layer optical index of 1.45 and a protein layer density of 1.4 g/cm3) and

correspond to the pair of parameters matching both the SPR and SAW data.

The last three columns are related to QCM-D measurements and illustrate

the fact that the higher the water content in the layer under investigation,

the higher the dissipation (∆D) and the more appropriate the viscous model

(with a 1/√n normalization factor) over the rigid mass model (with a 1/n

normalization factor). The equality sign in the 6th column (in which the rigid

mass assumption is made and in which the Sauerbrey relationship is applied)

relates the normalized frequency shift to a surface density in ng/cm2 using

the proportionality factor 20.1 ng/Hz for the 4.7 MHz resonance frequency

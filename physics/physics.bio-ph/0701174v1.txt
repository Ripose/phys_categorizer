We reveal that under moderate shear stress (η ˙γ ≈ 0.1 Pa) red blood cells present an oscillation of
their inclination (swinging) superimposed to the long-observed steady tanktreading (TT) motion. A
model based on a ﬂuid ellipsoid surrounded by a visco-elastic membrane initially unstrained (shape
memory) predicts all observed features of the motion: an increase of both swinging amplitude and
period (1/2 the TT period) upon decreasing η ˙γ, a η ˙γ-triggered transition towards a narrow η ˙γ-
range intermittent regime of successive swinging and tumbling, and a pure tumbling motion at
lower η ˙γ-values.

A human red blood cell (RBC) is a biconcave ﬂattened
disk, essentially made of a Newtonian hemoglobin solu-
tion encapsulated by a ﬂuid and incompressible lipid bi-
layer, underlined by a thin elastic cytoskeleton (spectrin
network) [1]. The complex structure of RBCs and their
response to a viscous shear ﬂow have a great inﬂuence on
ﬂow and mass transport in the microcirculation in both
health and disease [2]. The full understanding of this re-
sponse requires a direct comprehensive observation of cell
motion and deformation, and a model for deducing the
cell intrinsic properties from its behavior in shear ﬂow. It
is generally admitted that the two possible RBC move-
ments are the unsteady tumbling solid-like motion [3],
and the drop-like ’tanktreading’ motion for higher shear
stresses, where the cell maintains a steady orientation,
while the membrane rotates about the internal ﬂuid, as
reported respectively for RBCs suspended in plasma or in
high-viscosity media and submitted to high shear stresses
[3, 4, 5, 6]. However, the RBC movement at smaller
shear rate and close to the tumbling-tanktreading tran-
sition, has not been fully explored. Moreover, the actual
state of deformation of the elastic skeleton either in the
ﬂowing or in the resting RBC is still conjectural (”shape
memory” problem) [7]. Most models [6, 8] derive from
the analytical framework of Keller and Skalak (KS) [9],
which treats the RBC as a ﬂuid ellipsoidal membrane
enclosing a viscous liquid. Although this model qualita-
tively retrieves the two modes of motion, it does not cap-
ture the observed shear-rate dependency of the tumbling-

not account for the possible elastic energy storage in-
duced by the local deformations of the cytoskeleton dur-
ing tanktreading. Approaches including membrane elas-
ticity are either restricted to spherical resting shapes be-
cause of analytical complexities [10], or propose encour-
aging but still limited numerical analysis on tanktreading
elastic biconcave capsules [11].

Here, we reveal a new regime of motion for RBCs under
small shear ﬂow, characterized by an elastic capsule-like
oscillation of the cell inclination superimposed to tank-
treading that we name swinging. We develop a model,
which predicts both swinging and the shear-stress depen-
dency of the tumbling-tanktreading transition. It demon-
strates the existence of the elastic shape memory in the
membrane.

Direct measurements of cell orientation with respect
to the ﬂow direction (angle θ) and cell shape (lengths of
the long and small axis of the cell cross-section, a1 and
a2 respectively) are provided from side-view microscopic
imaging in a vertical plane parallel to the plane of shear
[12]. We varied the wall shear rate ˙γ (in the range 0-
5 s−1) and the outer viscosity ηo by suspending RBCs
in various solutions of dextran (concentration 6%, 7.5%
or 9% w/w and viscosity 22, 31 and 47 mPa.s respec-
tively). Therefore, the wall shear stress is varied in a
range from 0 to 0.25 Pa. For the highest values of the
external shear stress ηo ˙γ, tanktreading is observed. It is
characterized by i) a quasi-stationary cell shape with in-
signiﬁcant deformation (maximum variation of a1 ≤ 5%),
ii) rotation of the membrane, revealed from the motion
of small carboxylated beads stuck to the membrane (Fig.
1B) and iii) an oscillation of the cell inclination about
a mean value ranging from 6o to 25o (Figs. 1C and 2,
see [13]) at a frequency equal to twice the tanktreading
frequency (Fig. 1B). Such characteristics are not seen
on tanktreading viscous lipid vesicles [12, 14], neither
predicted [9, 15, 16, 17]. This oscillation is however ob-
served for non-perfectly spherical elastic millimeter-scale
capsules [18, 19] (Fig. 2B) or protein-coated drops [20],
and in numerical simulations on biconcave elastic shells
[11]. We explain this phenomenon by assuming RBC
shape memory. We state that the local elements of the
composite membrane (cytoskeleton and lipid bilayer), in-
cluding the elements which form the rim and the dim-

In order to derive tractable equations of motion, we use
the KS model. We consider an oblate ellipsoid ﬁlled with
a viscous liquid and delimited by a viscoelastic 3D thin
membrane, which includes the lipid bilayer and the un-
derlying cytoskeleton [21]. The membrane elements are
prescribed to rotate along elliptical trajectories parallel
to the shear plane, with a linear velocity ﬁeld [22] given
by: v1 = − ˙ω(a1/a2)x2, v2 = ˙ω(a2/a1)x1, v3 = 0, where
ω and ˙ω are the phase angle of a membrane element and
its instantaneous frequency of tanktreading respectively
(Fig. 1A). The KS equation for RBC motion is obtained
by stating that at equilibrium, the total moment exerted
by the external ﬂuid on the cell vanishes (First equation
in Eqs.2 below). In addition, the movement satisﬁes the
conservation of energy, i.e. the rate of dissipation of en-
ergy in the cell must equal the rate at which work is
done by the external ﬂuid on the cell. KS calculated
both rates assuming viscous energy dissipation in the
cell. We add to this latter contribution the elastic power
stored in the periodic elastic strain of the cytoskeleton
[24]: Pel = RΩ Tr(σ : D)dΩ, where Ω is the membrane
volume, D the eulerian strain rate tensor derived from
the KS velocity ﬁeld and σ the shear stress tensor in the
membrane; σ is computed from the local deformation of
the membrane due to tanktreading, assuming a simple
Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic material: σ = 2ηmD + 2µmE,
where E is the Euler-Almansi strain tensor obtained from
the KS velocity ﬁeld. After some algebra, Pel writes as

where ηm and µm are the membrane viscosity and the

ples are not equivalent and are not strained in the bi-
concave resting shape. They do consequently not store
elastic energy. Thus, during tanktreading, the elements
which form the rim at rest rotate about the stationary cell
shape to reach the dimples after rotation and reciprocally.
These elements are then locally strained and store elastic
energy. Both local deformation and energy storage are
periodic: each time the elements of the membrane make
a π-rotation, they retrieve their initial shape and are no
more strained. We emphasize that the periodic storage of
energy requires a non spherical unstrained state for the
RBC. Otherwise, the membrane elements will tanktread
without modifying the global state of stress of the cell,
preserving the steady nature of the tanktreading move-
ment.

f1, f2 and f3 are geometrical constants and V is the
RBC volume (same deﬁnition as in [9]). The limiting
case µm = ηm = 0 corresponds to KS. We numerically
solved the equations using the following set of parame-
ters for RBCs : a1 = a3 = 4µm, a2 = 1.5µm, Ω = Σ.e
[25], where Σ is the oblate ellipsoid area and e=50 nm
is the membrane thickness [26]. ηi is ﬁxed at the physi-
ological value of 10 mPa.s [6] and ηm is adjusted in the
range 0.7-2 Pa.s [6]. We obtain θ(t), ˙θ(t), ω(t) and ˙ω(t).
Suitable couples of µm and ηm values were found to re-
produce experimental RBC oscillations as seen in Fig.
2B (see [13]). One example of experimental capsule os-
cillation extracted from [19] is presented as well in Fig.
2B. An insight of experimental and numerical swinging
curves is provided from three parameters: the magnitude
∆θ = θmax − θmin, the mean angle ¯θ and the period Tosc
(or the frequency fosc) of oscillation (Fig. 2B). The ˙γ-
variations of these parameters are illustrated for one red
blood cell in Fig. 3A together with a numerical solution
of Eqns 2. While ¯θ decreases for decreasing ˙γ down to
0, Tosc and ∆θ increase until
˙γ reaches a critical value
˙γ−
c below which the cell tumbles at least once. Besides
direct observations (Fig. 1B), we illustrate the factor 2
of proportionality between fosc and ˙ω which relates the
movement of swinging of a cell to the movement of tank-
treading of its membrane, by reporting on a same graph
in Fig. 3B, variations of fosc/2 and ˙ω versus ˙γ, for diﬀer-
ent swinging RBCs observed in our experiment and for
diﬀerent tanktreading RBCs observed in the litterature
at higher ˙γ [5, 6]. Fig. 3B shows indeed the continuity of
the two regimes even though measured on diﬀerent type
of movement. Therefore, all experimental characteristics
are well captured by the model. Indeed, by treating the
elastic contribution as a small perturbation in the second
equation of (2), valid in the linear part, one recovers the
steady KS solution at the order 0 of the parameter in
front of sin(2ω), while at the ﬁrst order one ﬁnds that θ
oscillates at twice the tanktreading frequency (linear in
˙γ) and ∆θ scales as (µm/ ˙γ).

Contrarily to KS prediction, we observe that the tran-
sition of movement from tumbling to tanktreading (re-
spectively tanktreading to tumbling) is induced by tuning
up (respectively down) the applied shear rate. This tran-
sition is illustrated in Fig. 4A. Its more striking feature,
predicted and experimentally observed is the existence
of a regime of movement where the cells present succes-
sively swings and tumbles at a given ˙γ (Fig. 4B). The
model gives the ˙γ-range ([ ˙γ+
c ]) where this regime ex-
ists. Given the experimental constraints, it is not easy to
follow the cells suﬃciently long to observe a large series of
tumbles and swings. We deﬁne over a time scale of ∼ 20
s, the shear rate corresponding to a change in movement
from swinging to tumbling ( ˙γ<
c ) with decreasing ˙γ, and
from tumbling to swinging ( ˙γ>
c ) with increasing ˙γ. The

it is seen by requiring the second term in the second equa-

[21] Because of the 3D nature of the KS velocity ﬁeld, the
membrane deformation is considered to be 3D while other
non algebraically tractable approaches considered the de-
formation ﬁeld to be only 2D [6, 23].

[22] The KS velocity ﬁeld is not area conserving. However
improved models [23] that account for incompressibility
are much more complex algebraically and it is generally
considered that the simple KS velocity ﬁeld provides a
good approximation of the membrane deformation [6].

of ηo ˙γ>
c measured on a large RBC sampling
are shown in Fig. 5. They characterize the natural vari-
ability of the RBC elastic modulus and illustrates the
additional hysteresis eﬀect. From Fig. 5 and Fig. 4C, we
ﬁnd that µm ranges in the interval 0.14-2 Pa. By setting
the 2D shear modulus µm,S = µm.e we obtain values
ranging from 0.07 to 1×10−7 N/m (e = 50 nm) below
that usually reported [1, 10]. We also ﬁnd a comparable
diﬀerence on µm,S with that reported for the elastic cap-
sules by Walter et al [19]. This underestimation likely
originates from the major simpliﬁcations we made in or-
der to obtain simple analytical equations allowing the full
understanding of the physics of the problem: i) simplis-
tic constitutive equations, ii) approximate KS velocity
ﬁeld, which may overestimate membrane deformations.
In particular, Tran son Tay et al [6] suggested that the
Secomb-Skalak area conserving velocity ﬁeld [23] would
lead to a 70%-increase of the membrane viscosity com-
pared to that derived from the KS model.
iii) treat-
ment of deformations from a 3D description of the mem-
brane of RBCs and capsules although these systems form
mainly 2D-shells [21]. However, the main interest of this
tractable model is to understand the role of the various
physical parameters on the movement. For example, for
given external viscosity and shear rate, ∆θ is not much
sensitive to values of ηi and ηm taken in the physiolog-
ical range. ∆θ is essentially ﬁxed by µm, and thus the
measurement of the amplitude of swinging as a function
of the shear stress may provide a complementary method
to accurately determine µm on single ﬂowing RBCs in a
given sample.

In conclusion, the swinging movement and the shear-
stress triggered transition of motion of RBCs demon-
strate the existence of their shape memory and is a sig-
nature of their membrane shear elasticity. Despite its
simplicity, our model provides a good description of the
observed behaviors and we believe that a more sophis-
ticated model should allow an easy and sensitive deter-
mination of individual RBC mechanical properties. Fi-
nally, such experimental approach coupled to the reﬁned
model might be applied to a wide variety of soft shells
[18, 19, 20] and holds promises for applications in surface

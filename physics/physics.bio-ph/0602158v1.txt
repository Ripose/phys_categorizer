Voltage-activated ion channels vary randomly between a conducting or open state and a noncon-
ducting or closed state in response to thermal ﬂuctuations, with this variation inﬂuenced by the
membrane potential and a broad assortment of other factors. We show that signal transduction
is enhanced by a non-zero level of noise in a simple model of ion channels. The enhancement is
restricted to a ﬁnite range of signals, but this range can be extended using populations of channels.
The range increases more rapidly in heterogeneous populations of channels having various thresh-
olds than in homogeneous populations of channels with a single threshold. The diversity of cellular
ion channels may thus be present as an economical information-processing strategy, reducing the
metabolic cost of handling a broad class of electrochemical signals with simple processing elements.

Voltage-activated ion channels are essential elements
in biological signal transduction, playing important roles
in synaptic transmission, generation of neural action po-
tentials, regulation of membrane potentials and intracel-
lular Ca2+ concentrations, and other cellular functions
[1, 2, 3, 4]. The gating dynamics of the channels allow
the nonconductive cell membrane to take part in electri-
cal conduction and signaling. Channels vary between a
conducting or open state and a nonconducting or closed
state, with intermediary states in the transition being un-
stable and short-lived. The transition between open and
closed states is inﬂuenced by a broad assortment of fac-
tors, principally the membrane potential, but also includ-
ing hormones, toxins, protein kinases and phosphatases,
and thermal ﬂuctuations. Voltage-activated channels are
functionally diverse in their sensitivity to depolarization;
indeed, Lee et al. [5] identify no fewer than ﬁve distinct
activation thresholds for Ca2+ channels.

Channel gating dynamics are intrinsic stochastic tran-
sitions that depend strongly on external factors, so that
the channel constitutes a single-molecule sensor or com-
munication channel, transforming membrane potentials
into noisy ionic currents. Noise can have surprising ef-
fects in many nonlinear systems. Perhaps the best known
of these is stochastic resonance (SR), wherein the pres-
ence of noise enhances the response of a thresholding sys-
tem to a weak periodic signal (for a review, see Ref. [6]).
SR has been experimentally demonstrated in a system
of parallel ion channels [7], and studied theoretically in
numerous systems (see, e.g., Refs. [8, 9, 10, 11]).

In this work, we make use of a discrete model in which
the channel switches between distinct open and closed
states, omitting the dynamics of the transition process.
Such a discrete model captures the bistable nature of the
channel dynamics. By omitting the transition dynamics,
we assume that any stimulus to the channel varies slowly
compared to the time scale of channel opening and clos-

ing. We can extend this assumption to a quasistatic ap-
proximation, where the channel is always in equilibrium,
and describe the channel opening probability by using
the steady state (time t
) probability for the per-
→ ∞
missive state [12], also called the activation function of
the channel. This probability is given by

P∞ =

1
1 + e−zF (V −V0)/RT ,

(1)

where z is the (dimensionless) valence of the “gating par-
ticles,” F is Faraday’s constant, V is the transmembrane
potential, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the tem-
perature. The parameter V0 is a bias (or noisy threshold)
in the potential to which the channel tends to open.

For notational clarity, we lump several of the parame-

ters into a thermal noise parameter α, such that

α =

RT
zF

.

(2)

(3)

The deﬁnition in eq. (2) amounts to changing the units
of measure for the temperature to Volts. At room tem-
perature and with z = 1, α is approximately 25 mV.

Using eq. (2), the channel opening probability becomes

p (V ; α) =

1
1 + e−(V −V0)/α ,

−

with a corresponding probability of remaining closed of
p (V ; α). For single channels, or popu-
q (V ; α) = 1
lations of channels with homogeneous behavior, we can
take V0 = 0 without loss of generality; the behavior for
other values of V0 can be recovered by translating the
potential in eq. (3) by the desired value for the thresh-
old potential. In heterogeneous populations of channels,
the diﬀering values of the threshold potentials can have a
profound eﬀect on the behavior of the system of channels,
as we will demonstrate below.

FIG. 1: First order approximation of the expectation value for
the channel opening. Near the threshold potential (V0 = 0)
of the channel, the expectation is nearly linear. Further from
the threshold, the expectation value saturates at either zero
or one, where the linear approximation diverges from the true
value. The values shown here are based on thermal noise
α = 1, giving a response width W = 2.

For a system of N channels, each of which are exposed
to the same transmembrane potential V but with diﬀer-
ent realizations of the noise (i.e., we have i.i.d. noise), we
let ZN be the number of channels that open during the
time interval. The expected state of the membrane, i.e.,
ZN , can be calculated in a straightforward fashion. The
expectation value
ZN (V ; α)
can be expressed using p (V ; α), q (V ; α), and N , giving

In calculating eqs. (4) and (5), we have made use of the
independence of the noise for the channels.

We will focus on the behavior of ion channels near
the threshold value. To explore the ability of the ion
channels to serve as a transducer of electrical signals,
we reproduce the input potential by decoding the state
of the membrane (i.e., the numbers of open and closed
channels). Near the threshold, this gives rise to linear
decoding rules. The basic approach is similar to the “re-
verse reconstruction” using linear ﬁltering that has been
applied with great eﬀect to the analysis of a number of
biological systems (see, e.g., Refs. [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]).

into a broad range of similar values. Thus, the presence
of noise enhances signal transduction without requiring
a precise relation between V and α. This eﬀect is anal-
ogous to the “stochastic resonance without tuning” ﬁrst
reported by Collins et al. [18].

Informally stated, SR without tuning allows for a wider
range of potentials to be accurately decoded from the
channel states for any particular value of α. To make
this notion of “wider range” precise, we again focus our
attention on the expected behavior of the channels (see
Z
ﬁg. 1). The expected channel response
matches well
h
with the linear approximation when
< α. From this,
V
|
|
the width W can be deﬁned to be 2α. Other deﬁnitions
for the response width are, of course, possible, but we still
should observe that the width is proportional to α, since
the probability for channel opening depends only on the
ratio of V and α (eq. (3)). The same width is found for
multiple identical channels, because the total expected
current is proportional to the single channel behavior,
without broadening the curve in ﬁg. 1.

i

The response width can thus be increased by increas-
ing the thermal noise parameter α. As seen in ﬁgs. 2
and 3, such an increase ultimately leads to a growth in
the decoding error ∆ ˆV 2
N . As α becomes large, ∆ ˆV 2
N is
dominated by σ2
and we have the asymptotic behavior

based on eq. (11). The growth in ∆ ˆV 2
N with increas-
ing α thus can be overcome by further increasing the
number of channels in the population. Therefore, the re-
sponse width W is eﬀectively constrained by the number
of channels N , with W = O(√N ) for large N .

An arbitrary response width can be produced by as-
sembling enough channels. However, this approach is
ineﬃcient, and greater width increases can be achieved
with the same number of channels. Consider instead di-

3

viding up the total width into M subranges. These sub-
ranges can each be covered by a subpopulation of N chan-
nels, with the subpopulations having diﬀerent thresh-
olds from one another. The width of each subrange is
O(√N ), but the total width is O(M √N ). Thus, the
total response width can increase more rapidly as addi-
tional types of channels are added. Conceptually, multi-
ple types of channels arise naturally as a way to provide
a wide range of accurate responses, with multiple chan-
nels in each type providing independence from any need
to “tune” the thermal noise to a particular level.

To describe the behavior of channels with diﬀerent
thresholds, much of the preceding analysis can be directly
applied by translating the functions along the potential
axis to obtain the desired threshold. However, system be-
havior was previously explored near the threshold value,
but heterogeneous populations of channels have multi-
ple thresholds. Nonetheless, we can produce a compara-
ble system by simply assessing system behavior near the
center of the total response width.

To enable a clean comparison, we set the thresholds in
the heterogeneous populations so that a linear decoding
rule can be produced. A simple approach that achieves
this is to space the thresholds of the subpopulations by
2W = 4α, with all channels being otherwise equal. The
subpopulations with lower thresholds provide an upward
shift in the expected number of open channels for higher
threshold subpopulations, such that the diﬀerent subpop-
ulations are all approximated to ﬁrst order by the same
line. Thus, the expected total number of open channels
leads to a linear decoding rule by expanding to ﬁrst or-
der and inverting, as was done earlier for homogeneous
populations. Note that this construction requires no ad-
ditional assumptions about how the channel states are to
be interpreted.

To illustrate the eﬀect of multiple types of channels, we
begin with a homogeneous baseline population M = 1 of
N = 1000 channels with V0 = 0 and apply a potential
V with thermal noise α = 1. Using the deﬁnition above,
the response width is W = 4. We then consider two
cases, homogeneous and heterogeneous, in each of which
we increase the response width by doubling the number
of channels while maintaining similar error expectations
for the decoded currents.

In the homogeneous case, we have a single population
(M = 1) with N = 2000 channels. Doubling the num-
ber of channels allows us to increase the temperature
parameter α by a factor of √2 with similar expected er-
rors outside the response width. Thus, we observe an
extended range, relative to the baseline case, in which
we can reconstruct the stimulus potential from the state
of the channels (ﬁg. 4).

In the heterogeneous case, we instead construct two
subpopulations (M = 2) with N = 1000 channels. We
leave the thermal noise parameter unchanged at α = 1.
One of the subpopulations is modiﬁed so that the chan-

nel thresholds lie at +W = 2, while the other is modiﬁed
so that the channel thresholds lie at
2. The
resulting system of channels has a broad range in which
we can reconstruct the stimulus potential with low er-
ror, markedly superior to the baseline and homogeneous
cases (ﬁg. 4). The approach used in this example can be
directly extended to three or more subpopulations.

The foregoing analysis and example suggest that the
diversity of channel types found in a living cell are present
as an information processing strategy, providing a means
to eﬃciently handle a broad class of electrochemical sig-
nals. The superior scaling properties of heterogeneous
populations of channels can have a profound impact on
the cellular metabolism; large numbers of channels imply
a large energetic investment, both in terms of the proteins
needed to construct the channels and of the increased de-
mand on ion pumps that accompanies the greater ionic
currents [3]. The action potentials generated in neu-
rons can require a signiﬁcant energetic cost [19], making
the tradeoﬀ between reliably coding information and the
metabolic costs potentially quite important.

In this picture, we expect that diﬀerent types of cells
will require diﬀerent numbers of functionally diﬀerent ion
channels. Cells that perform sophisticated signaling and
respond to a broad variety of signals will need a large
number of functionally diﬀerent ion channels, while cells
that are more specialized to a narrower class of signals are
likely to have a smaller number of functional types. This
appears to be generally consistent with the comparatively
large variety of ion channels found in excitable cells such
as neurons [4].

Although we have used a speciﬁc model consisting of
channels with thermal ﬂuctuations modulating an input
potential, we expect that the key result is more widely
applicable. The demonstration of the advantage of multi-

4

ple channel types largely arises from two factors that are
not speciﬁc to the model channels. First, the distance of
the input potential from the threshold is proportional to
the level of the thermal noise, and, second, the total vari-
ance of the inputs to the channels is proportional to the
number of channels. Ultimately, a multiplicity of func-
tional types of channels with varying thresholds arises
because the independently distributed noise provides a
natural scale for the system.

The Genetic Code as a Chronicle of Early Events in the Origin of Life

Molecular evidence regarding the genetic code has been examined and the ﬁndings on the

nature of the early events responsible for the amino acid distribution pattern in the code

are reported.

Molecular evidence on the genetic code has been examined with the aim of identifying

early events responsible for the amino acid distribution pattern in the code. A tree of

codon assignments resulted that was rooted in the four N-ﬁxing amino acids (Asp. Glu,

Asn, Gln) and the sixteen base triplets of the NAN set (A, adenine; N, any base). This

locally phased (commaless) code appeared to have arisen from ambiguous translation of a

poly(A) collector strand in a surface reaction network. Copolymerisation of these amino

acids produced polyanionic oligopeptides able to anchor uncharged amide residues to a

positively charged mineral surface. The ﬁrst genes were required to increase eﬃciency

of N-ﬁxation relying on oligopeptides. They were probably template strands spliced into
tRNA. Expansion of the code was conditional on initiation at the 5′-base of a translated
sequence. It reduced the risk of mutation to an unreadable codon and led to incorporation

of increasingly hydrophobic residues. As codons of the NUN set (U, uracil) were assigned

most slowly, they received the most non-polar amino acids. The folded proteins ferredoxin

and Gln synthetase evidently originated in early- and mid-expansion phase, respectively.

Surface metabolism ceased by the end of code expansion, as cells bounded by a proteo-

phospholipid membrane had emerged. Incorporation of positively charged and aromatic

amino acids followed. They entered the code by codon capture. Synthesis of eﬃcient

enzymes with acid-base catalysis was then possible. Formation of class I and II aminoacyl-

tRNA synthetases was attributed to this stage. The ﬁrst cells formed in approximately

7 million yr, an interval less than the ocean circulation cycle for passage through hot

submarine vents. It was estimated the Standard Code evolved within 20 million yr. These

studies on the genetic code provide empirical evidence that a surface reaction network,

centred on C-ﬁxing autolcatalytic cycles, rapidly led to a cellular life on Earth.

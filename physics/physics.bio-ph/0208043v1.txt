Abstrat

Plankton is the produtive base of aquati eosystems and plays a ma jor

role in the global ontrol of atmospheri arbon dioxide. Nevertheless, after

intensive study, the fators that drive its spatial distribution are still far from

being lear. The models proposed so far show very limited agreement with

atual data as many of their results are not onsistent with (cid:28)eld observations.

Here we show that (cid:29)utuations and turbulent di(cid:27)usion in standard prey-

predator models are able to aurately and onsistently explain plankton

(cid:28)eld observations at mesosales (1-100 km). This inludes not only the spatial

pattern but also its temporal evolution. We expliitly eluidate the interplay

between physial and biologial fators, suggesting that the form in whih

small sale bioti (cid:29)utuations are transferred to larger sales may onstitute

one of the key elements in determining the spatial distribution of plankton

in the sea.

Understanding how omplex eosystems work often relies on simpli(cid:28)ed mod-

els that disregard many details of the atual system while retaining the es-

sential information [1, 2, 3℄.

In the ase of marine eosystems, not only

the simplest approahes failed to explain the spatial distribution of plank-

ton populations but also more sophistiated models were unable to aount

onsistently for the most remarkable features [4℄. Even now, it is not learly

understood why under apparent homogeneous onditions, suh as temper-

ature and nutrients, plankton is still pathilly distributed. This partiular

situation is of remarkable importane sine in the absene of external soures

of pathiness the pattern must arise as a mere onsequene of the interations

between the individuals. The typial form of these patterns is illustrated in

Fig. 1. The main trait is that zooplankton is more pathilly distributed than

phytoplankton [1, 5℄.

The most intuitive model that an be proposed to explain plankton dy-

namis [2℄ onsiders the population densities of prey (phytoplankton), N ,

and predators (zooplankton), P :

∂N
∂t

∂P
∂t

= FN (N, P ) + DN ∇2N ,

= FP (N, P ) + DP ∇2P ,

(1)

(2)

where DN and DP are di(cid:27)usion oe(cid:30)ients; and FN and FP are funtions

that aount for the interation between both speies. This lass of mod-

3

els is the most frequently used in theories on pattern formation in eol-

ogy [2, 6, 7℄.

In the ase of plankton, they were able to display spatial

heterogeneity under homogeneous onditions [8℄. Zooplankton, however, was

less pathilly distributed than phytoplankton, in ontradition with the ob-

served pattern [1, 8℄.

There are two relevant features that are not taken into aount by this

kind of models. First, di(cid:27)usion in the sea is not quantitatively well modeled

by usual Fikian di(cid:27)usion [9℄. Both types of di(cid:27)usion proesses will tend

to spread and mix the populations, but the spei(cid:28) form in whih this is

ahieved is di(cid:27)erent. Seond, there is always an intrinsi stohastiity asso-

iated with the dynamis of the population [10, 11℄. From birth to death, all

proesses share some degree of hane. The way randomness manifests in the

dynamis of the individuals depends on the sale we are looking at [1℄; de-

terministi equations are expeted to be valid in the limit of high numbers of

individuals [12℄. Therefore, a deterministi desription may be a reasonable

one for phytoplankton alone, but this does not need to be so for zooplankton

whih has muh fewer individuals [13℄. More importantly, while phytoplank-

ton interats mainly with zooplankton, zooplankton interats also with (cid:28)sh

and whales whih are far from being evenly distributed.

These two additional features have been inorporated in a prey-predator

model:

∂N
∂t

= FN (N, P ) − ~v · ~∇N ,

(3)

4

∂P
∂t

= FP (N, P ) − ~v · ~∇P + ξ(t) ,

(4)

where dispersal is given by advetion with a veloity (cid:28)eld ~v [≡ ~v(~r)℄ that

depends on the position ~r , and where a noise term ξ(t) has been inluded.

In general, the e(cid:27)ets of the advetive terms depend on the preise form

of the veloity (cid:28)eld. For some turbulent (cid:28)elds [14℄, the e(cid:27)et of advetion

an be simpli(cid:28)ed as follows: given a passive (cid:28)eld f (~r, t) whih evolves as

the spatial Fourier transform of f (~r, t) follows from

∂f
∂t

= −~v · ~∇f .

dfk
dt

= −D|k|βfk ,

(5)

(6)

where k is the wave number and D a onstant.

In this ase, advetion

an e(cid:27)etively be viewed as a di(cid:27)usion proess with a di(cid:27)usion oe(cid:30)ient

that depends on the sale. In ontrast to usual Fikian

di(cid:27)usion, the variane of the (cid:28)eld is not proportional to t but is given by

. This is the type of time dependene observed for the dispersion

of traers in the sea [9, 15℄, from whih one an obtain the expliit value of

Def f (k) = D|k|2−β

hr2i ∼ t2/β

the parameter β .

To render our model analytially tratable, we onsider the system around

a stable state. Flutuations in zooplankton, ξ , move the system away from

equilibrium. If the (cid:29)utuations are not too large, we an perform a linear

5

expansion of FP and FN :

FN (N, P ) = cN − a11N − a12P ,

FP (N, P ) = cP + a21N − a22P .

(7)

Here cN , cP , a11 , a12 , a21 , and a22 are positive onstants. For the sim-

plest form of the noise term [12℄, Gaussian white and unorrelated in spae

[hξ(~r, t)i = 0 and hξ(~r, t)ξ(~r′, t′)i = 2σ2δ(~r′ − ~r)δ(t′ − t)℄, and for a22 ∼ 0 the

variane spetra are given by

SN (k) =

12σ2
a2
( ˜DN + ˜DP ) ˜DN ˜DP

and SP (k) =

(8)

σ2
˜DP

.

where

is the intensity of

˜DN ≡ D|k|β + a11 ,

˜DP ≡ D|k|β + a22 , and σ2

the noise soure. The assumptions involved do not substantially onstrain

the appliability of the results. When a22 is not negligible, the expressions

beome more involved but the qualitative behavior is still the same. In par-

tiular, the high wave-number limit remains unhanged. On the other hand,

the type of noise we have onsidered is quite general and an arise, among

others, from a random distribution of predators feeding on zooplankton or

even from the birth proess itself [16℄. Other types of noise with di(cid:27)erent

properties, e.g. as those indued by turbulene [14, 4℄, are ertainly present

but we assume that they are not relevant for the spetral properties of the

pattern at the mesosales.

The variane spetra obtained from previous equations display a power-

law region with exponent −3β for the phytoplankton and −β for the zoo-

plankton. The value of β ∼ 0.87 inferred from di(cid:27)usion in the sea [15℄

leads to exponents −2.6 and −0.8, both in exellent agreement with (cid:28)eld

data [1, 17, 18℄. It is worth emphasizing that the power law behavior ap-

pears only for su(cid:30)iently high wavenumber (short sales); for low wavenum-

bers (long sales), the variane spetra is (cid:29)at, as observed in most (cid:28)eld

data [1, 17, 18℄.

In the same way, one an ompute the oherene between two patterns at

di(cid:27)erent times [18℄, whih provides information about the global dynamis.

For the phytoplankton this quantity is given by

N(k, ∆t)
N(k, 0)

=

˜DP e

˜DN ∆t − ˜DN e
˜DP − ˜DN

˜DP ∆t

,

(9)

where N(k, ∆t) = R

∞
0

||N(k, ω)||2e−iω∆tdω . This result indiates that short

sales lose their orrelation faster than long ones and that eventually the

whole pattern will be deorrelated, as observed in satellite measurements [18℄.

In Fig. 2 we plot the typial form of the variane spetra and the squared

oherene for di(cid:27)erent time lags. Both of them are in exellent agreement

with (cid:28)eld data [1, 17, 18, 19℄. Remarkably, the main properties of the pat-

tern already appear in the linear regime. Therefore, nonlinear interations

that drive the system towards a stable state will lead to similar results. To

study this aspet in more detail, we have performed numerial simulations

7

for typial nonlinear interations as explained in the aption of Fig. 3. The

resulting two-dimensional spatial distribution, transets, and variane spe-

tra (shown in Fig. 3) agree with both the linear model and (cid:28)eld data. Other

types of nonlinear interations (cid:22) e.g. di(cid:27)erent funtional responses (cid:22) as

well as di(cid:27)erent types of noise (cid:22) e.g. ating on zooplankton growth rate (cid:22)

also produe similar results (data not shown).

Field observations indiate that the power law region of the variane spe-

tra and the value of the exponent of this power law are robust properties of

the system; i.e. these properties are present under a wide variety of on-

ditions. In our model, there is always a power law region whose exponent

does not depend on bioti fators but is ompletely determined by the spe-

i(cid:28) form in whih turbulent di(cid:27)usion ats on the system. This provides a

straightforward explanation of the predominane of the observed exponents

for the phytoplankton falling between −3 and −2. These are the values that

arise for 2D (β = 1) and 3D (β = 2/3) isotropi turbulene, respetively [14℄.

In the sea, the value of this exponent will depend on the partiular situation,

but it is reasonable to assume that it will be between those of 2D and 3D

isotropi turbulene, as the available data shows [9, 15℄. There are also non-

robust properties, suh as the region where the variane spetra turns (cid:29)at.

In the model, this depends on many fators: e.g. growth and death rate,

and turbulene. Field data shows that, indeed, the position of this region

exhibits great variability and that sometimes it is not even present in the

range of sales observed.

8

Turbulent di(cid:27)usion and noise are two obvious features that have already

been onsidered in the ontext of marine eosystems, but none of them by

itself has been able to explain the mesosale patterns.

In partiular, it is

well known that noise generates variability, i.e. that noise an be a soure

of pathiness [20, 21℄. For instane, reation-di(cid:27)usion prey-predator models

with noise produe patterns that at a glane strongly resemble those observed

in the sea [22, 23℄. The exponents obtained (−6 for the phytoplankton and

−2 for the zooplankton), however, are far from the observed ones. This

quantitative, but not qualitative, disagreement is due to the dependene

of the e(cid:27)etive di(cid:27)usion oe(cid:30)ient with the sale. Thus, reation-di(cid:27)usion

models are unable to integrate orretly the sale dependene of the physial

properties of the environment. When this is taken into aount, noise not

only generates patterns but is also able to produe the right ones.

Turbulene plays a somehow ambivalent role. It an at in the same way

as di(cid:27)usion does (transferring variane from smaller to larger sales) and

also in the opposite way (from larger to smaller sales). These two types of

proesses are referred to as turbulent di(cid:27)usion and turbulent stirring, respe-

tively. The former is the one we have onsidered in our model. It was already

onsidered in Ref. [4℄ together with the type of noise that turbulene indues

but without the noise that an arise from bioti fators. The latter only

plays an important role when some degree of environmental heterogeneity is

present [24℄. Indeed, it has been shown that turbulent stirring an generate

patterns that resemble the observed ones if spatial heterogeneity and time

9

delays are introdued in the model [25℄. The type of time delays introdued,

however, an lead non-realisti situations suh as growing zooplankton in the

absene of phytoplankton.

Finally, it is important to emphasize that in our ase noise is the key

element that allows moving from the individual to the population desription.

Our results suggest that zooplankton dynamis at lower sales a(cid:27)ets the

pattern at the mesosale in the same way as noise does. Considering a more

detailed desription is not neessary to explain and to understand the main

harateristis of the pattern. This does not mean that the atual dynamis

of zooplankton is not important at all: its growth rate, its survival, and the

intensity of noise itself depend, among other fators, on how zooplankton

aggregates and on how it avoids its predators [26℄.

It rather means that

under a wide range of onditions all those intriate mehanisms will lead to

patterns with properties as those indued by noise.

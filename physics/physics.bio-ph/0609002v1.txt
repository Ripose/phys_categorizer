Variants of the Kohonen model are proposed to study biological principles of self-organization in a model
of young brain. We suggest a function to measure aquired knowledge and use it to auto-adapt the topology of
neuronal connectivity, yielding substantial organizational improvement relative to the standard model. In the
early phase of organization with most intense learning, we observe that neural connectivity is of Small World
type, which is very efﬁcient to organize neurons in response to stimuli. In analogy to human brain where pruning
of neural connectivity (and neuron cell death) occurs in early life, this feature is present also in our model, which
is found to stabilize neuronal response to stimuli.

Introduction.

In physics the reductionist school of
thought has long time prevailed, which postulates that
the way of understanding laws of nature is by looking at
its most elementary building blocks. This point of view
has been questioned from the viewpoint of complexity,
which says that in nature there are emergent phenom-
ena which cannot be predicted from the laws of ele-
mentary constituents - for example the shape of a snow
ﬂake cannot be obtained from the laws of hydrogen and
oxygen atoms [1]. A prime example of complexity is
the self-organization of human brain. Experimental in-
formation on the organization of brain comes from ob-
servation of power laws 1/ f a
(with a ≈ 1) in the fre-
quency power spectrum of electrical signals measured
by electroencephalograms (EEG) [2, 3] and by magne-
toencephalograms (MEG) [4]. Such power laws reﬂect
a fractal temporal behavior [5]. Power laws have been
found also in size distributions of epilectic seizures and
neural avalanches [6], hinting to a fractal behavior in
seize. To explain such power laws the sand pile model of
self-organized criticality (SOC) has been devised [7, 8]
and used to model EEG spectra [9]. On the other hand,
power laws in frequency have been observed in local
ﬁeld potentials (LFP) measured in cat parietal associ-
ation cortex, which seem inconsistent with the SOC
model [10]. From the information theory point of view,
however, it is not clear which information is transmitted
in EEG signals or neural avalanches.

Here we consider self-organization of young brain,
based on the Kohonen model [11, 12]. It is a biolog-
ical property that the organization of visual cortex in
mammals occurs during a relative short time window
shortly after birth during which neural connectivity is
established [13, 14]. Most remarkably, this is accom-

panied by genetically controlled neuron cell death and
pruning of synaptic connections [15, 16]. In brains of
mature adults, functional magnetic resonance imaging
(FMRI) has shown evidence for functional networks
of correlated brain activity [17], which display small
world and scale free architecture. Small World Net-
work (SWN) neural connectivity has been found in a
network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons to give a fast and
coherent system response [18], in an associative mem-
ory model to improve restoration of perturbed memory
patterns [19] and to reduce learning time and error in a
multi-layer learning model [20].

In this paper, three main issues are addressed: (i) we
establish a link between network topology and ﬂow of
information, and show that biologically inspired auto-
adaption of the Kohonen network improves organiza-
tion; (ii) we observe that SWN topology is present dur-
ing most of the organizational phase; (iii) we show that
biologically observed pruning of synaptic connections
in the early evolution of the network is beneﬁcial for or-
ganization, while reconnections give an adverse effect.

Kohonen model. The Kohonen network [11] is a
model of organization of information in the visual cor-
tex in the brain. Information coming from the eye may
consist of luminosity/darkness, directions/shapes, col-
ors, motions in all directons of the visual ﬁeld, repre-
sented by a large set of stimuli in a high-dimensional
space. One of the brain tasks is to recognize images
and group them into classes like, e.g., humans, animals,
buildings, roads, etc.
In the Kohonen model, this is
achieved by reducing (mapping) the high-dimensional
manifold of Q stimuli to a low-dimensional (2-D) man-
ifold, represented by N ≪ Q neurons, which maintain
topological continuity, i.e. proximate stimuli yield prox-
imate neurons. The dynamical rules of the standard
Kohonen map are as follows [11]. There are stimuli
q = 1, . . . , Q, located at ~pq in a vector space, and there
are neurons, i = 1, . . . , N, living on a 2-D grid map (Fig.

1). To each neuron is assigned a weight vector ~wi living
in the same vector space as the stimuli. At each time
t, a stimulus ~pq is randomly selected, and the neuronal
weights are updated according to a rule derived from
unsupervised Hebbian learning:

~wi(t + 1) = ~wi(t) + h (t)[~pq(t) −~wi(t)], ∀i ∈ Vg(t) , (1)

where neuron g is the “winning” neuron, being closest
to stimulus ~pq, and Vg deﬁnes an order of neighborhood
(topology) for neuron g, given by a regular grid map
(Fig. 1). For example, Vg = 1 corresponds to the 4 near-
est neighbors of g, while Vg = 3 includes the 20 next-to-
nearest neighbors. The parameter h denotes the learning
rate. Using this rule, the neuronal map learns the topol-
ogy of the data set and eventually becomes deformed
(for example, see Fig. 8). The order of neighborhood
V (t) is initially high, i.e. the map is highly connected.
During evolution of organization V (t) decreases gradu-
ally, as shown in Fig. 2. h (t) also decreases linearly in
time to ensure convergence of neuronal weights.

Knowledge and auto-adaptivity. In the standard Ko-
honen model, the evolution of the map topology V (t)
as well as the learning rate h (t) are determined a priori.
This conditions the ﬁnal absolute error of modelization,

suggest to adapt dynamically V (t) and h (t) to the state
of the network at time t, and in particular to the cumula-
tively learnt information. Moreover, we suggest to intro-
duce a locally independent learning rate h
i(t) for each
neuron. For such purpose we construct (inspired by the
Growing Neural Gas network [21]) the function of local
attraction Aint

i (t),

Aint
i (t) = Aint

i (t − 1) + d

i,g(t) k ~pq(t) − ~wi(t) k ,

(3)

for all i = 1, . . . , N, with initial value Aint
i (0) = 0. This
function counts how much the weight vector of a neuron
i has moved, being an indicator how much that neuron
has learnt. Low/high attraction means that such neuron
has rarely/often been a “winner”. From local attraction,
we construct an adapted learning rate individually dif-
ferent for each neuron (which is biologically more plau-
sible) of the following form

i(t) (cid:181)

Aint
i (t)

.

(4)

The learning rate is chosen to be inversely proportional
to local attraction, because for a neuron not having
learnt at all it is advantageous to have a high potential
learning speed, while a neuron which has learnt much
tends to saturation, i.e. learning speed becomes slow. In
this way we obtain a new version - called multi-rhythm
- of the Kohonen model.

Starting from such new learning rate, we will deﬁne
an internal knowledge function Kint. Intuitively, one ex-
pects that learning rates are low and homogeneously
distributed among the neurons, when the network has
achieved organization, i.e. has learnt much informa-
tion. This is the basis for the following deﬁnition of
the knowledge function Kint, expressed in terms of an

with initial value Kint (0) = 0 and where Aint denotes
the average of Aint
i over all neurons i ∈ {1, . . . , N}. The
function Kint varies in the range 1/N ≤ Kint ≤ 1, and be-
comes maximal when all Aint
i are equal. Fig. 4 shows the
temporal behavior of function Kint and the absolute er-
ror E ext . The decreasing error function E ext mirrors the
behavior of function Kint and hence justiﬁes the inter-
pretation of the latter as knowledge gain. Fig. 5 shows
the complementary behavior of E ext and Kint for the spe-
cial case where V (t) is kept constant during all of the
learning process. It should be noted that although er-
ror E ext can be used to measure the error at the end of
organization, it is not part of the Kohonen network, i.e.
not available dynamically. However, Kint(t) is available
to the network at any time t. Thus we propose to dy-
namically adapt the number of connections M(t) using
Kint (t):

M(t) (cid:181) −Kint(t) .

(6)

This yields another version - called self-instructed -
of the Kohonen model, where the change of topology
adapts itself to the rhythm of knowledge gain.

Dynamical link between topology and information
content.
In information theory, Marchiori and Latora
[22, 23] deﬁned network connectivity dimensions on
global and local scales, Dglobal and Dlocal, which ex-
plicitely show the link between topology and function
of the network, which here means efﬁcient transmis-
sion of information. A network of SWN architecture
is both locally and globally efﬁcient, corresponding to
Dglobal and Dlocal being low [22, 23]. Fig. 6 shows
the correspondence between Dglobal, Dlocal, and abso-
lute error E ext .
In biology, often there is a link be-

cal connectivity dimension Dglobal (open circles), Dlocal (dots)

tion.

tween structure and function, e.g.
the structure of the
hemoglobin molecule ﬁts its functional task of trans-
porting oxygen. Fig. 6 shows that Dglobal and Dlocal
are both low - indicating SWN connectivity, i.e. the net-
work is highly connected at all length scales. SWN con-
nectivity has been found beneﬁcial in supervised learn-
ing [20]. Here, SWN topology persists during most of
the organizational phase, i.e. the regime where the er-
ror decreases until saturation. This regime corresponds
to an increase of accumulated (learnt) knowledge (see
Fig. 4). Towards the end of organization, the network
looses its SWN character (reﬁnement of spatial scale of
learning, formation of separate islands of neurons rep-
resenting classes of stimuli). The pruning of connec-
tions appears to be an advantage because the progres-
sive independence of neurons leads to a better precision
in the local placement of neural weights. This has been
conﬁrmed by exploring the alternative of allowing for
reconnections, which led to a larger error and deterio-
ration of organization (see Fig. 7). This gives a pos-

sible explanation for biologically observed pruning of
synaptic connections during organization in the brain of
mammals in a relatively short postnatal period.

Results. For a ﬁxed learning duration (t = 104 iter-
ations until stability of organization has been reached),
the standard Kohonen model is compared with the self-
instructed multi-rhythm version, using a 10 × 10 neu-
ral grid map. First, three different 2-D data sets are
tested. They are each composed of Q = 800 stimuli
with different spatial distributions (see Fig. 8). Fig.8
shows that the neurons are closer to stimuli in the self-
instructed multi-rhythm version relative to the standard
version. Also a substantial reduction in the ﬁnal abso-
lute error E ext (t ) is observed (see Tab.I). Ranging be-
tween only 19% to 66% of the error of the standard Ko-
honen model, the self-instructed multi-rhythm version
is shown to be both more efﬁcient and robust. Indeed,
the standard deviations obtained over 10 replications is
very low (≈ 1%). Second, some high dimensional data
sets were also tested. Among them, the “Pima Indians
Diabetes”, 8-dimensions with Q = 768 stimuli [24], and
the “Hall of Fame”, 15-dimensions with Q = 1320 [25],
and found qualitatively similar results (see Tab. I).

In summary, a dynamical link between geometry and
function (organization) was introduced in the Koho-
nen network, based on its dynamically aquired infor-
mation. Thus adaptation, also found in nature, leads
to substantial improvement of organization in the con-
text of our model. At the beginning of organization, the
SWN topology causes communication at all scales, both
global and local, and the network learns very quickly.
We postulate that such topology is beneﬁcial in any in-
formation organizing network. As knowledge increases,
the communication scale changes towards more local
connectivity, until total independence of neurons due to
pruning is reached. We found pruning of connections

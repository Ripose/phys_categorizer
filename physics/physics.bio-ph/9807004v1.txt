Comment on ”Statistical Mechanics of
Membrane-Protein Conformation: A Ho-
mopolymer Model”

In a recent Letter Park and Sung1 modeled a
membrane-protein conformation by grand canonical en-
semble approach using a homopolymer model.
In this
comment I would like to point out that although their
model has no serious physical mistake, it is far from bio-
logical reality.

The basic scenario of their model

is depicted in
Fig.1(a). Therefore, they expand the interaction into
loops, inclusions and adsorptions. It is unrealistic in four
aspects: Firstly, for a real membrane the chemical po-
tential inside and outside the cell should be diﬀerent.
However, this point is not included in their fugacities.
Secondly, although real protein sequence is head-tail dis-
tinguishable and the authors tried to distinguish it in
their calculation (Eq. (6)), however, their mathematical
model does not include this eﬀect because QS, QL and
QH are only classical numbers which are commutable.
Thirdly, They consider adsorptions and inclusions to be
of the same order processes. However, it is questionable
because the number of hydrogen bonds involved in an in-
clusion can vary. Furthermore, the last diagram in their
Fig.2 is unlikely to happen because it requires much too
high total free energy, i.e. include entropy eﬀects, to ac-
tivate. Fourthly, and most importantly, their model is
inconsistent with a three-dimensional structural ﬁnding,
to a resolution of 1.9˚A, of the α-hemolysin pore almost
two years ago2.

The ﬁrst point is allright as a ﬁrst order approximation
of the cellular environment. However, the second point
is mathematically wrong. On the other hand, the struc-
tural ﬁnding told us that protein should looks like sperms
with a big ’head’ which consists of about 80% of the total
animo acids. Therefore, the head-tail distinguishibiltiy is
important. It can be considered as a collective partition
function diﬀerent from the partition function of the other
part of the protein chain. Furthermore, the ’tail’ (in the
authors’ terminology) is unlikely to form a second ad-
sorption on the membrane surface. It should be folded
back to itself to form a ’head’ instead, if one thinks in
terms of linear polymers.

The structural ﬁnding told us that protein aggregates
to form a pore due to several protein’s tail penetrating
the membrane (Fig.1b) instead of one protein chain wind-
ing back and forth on the membrane (Fig.1a). These
protein units are bound together because of extensive
hydrophobic and hydrophilic contacts of their heads.
Speciﬁcally, for the sample studied in Ref.2, it is seven
pieces gathered together to form a mushroom-like pore.
The reader should consult Ref.2 for better illustrations
and thorough explanation.

In conclusion it turns out nature operates much more
eﬃciently than the authors expected. The structural
ﬁnding told us that protein penetrating the membrane

only as a ’zeroth order’ process in the authors’ formu-
lation, i.e., only single inclusion and single adsorptions
are possible. Furthermore, these two processes actually
happen in sequence. They are not separate processes.
Therefore there will not have the problem about which
one have higher energy.

FIG. 1. (a) People though membrane-protein interacts like
chop-sticks and spaghetti. But how could such high order
interactions happen in nature ? (b) With better resolution,
structural ﬁnding has resolved deﬁnitely that the interaction
is only ’zeroth order’, but with many protein units.

I thank P. J. Park and W. Sung for the preprint of
their work. This work is partially supported by APEC

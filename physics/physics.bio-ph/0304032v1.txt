N2 association to the FeMo-cofactor of nitrogenase, including the recently identiﬁed central N
ligand, has been investigated using ﬁrst-principles electronic structure calculations. The oxidation
state of the resting state of the cofactor and its electronic structure has been identiﬁed. A single
proton is added to the sulfur bridges following each electron transfer to the cofactor. During N2
association, the cofactor undergoes large rearrangements resulting in opening the central Fe-cage of
the cofactor. N2 binds axially while the bond of the bridging SH group breaks. It is then able to
insert between the two Fe sites in a bridged conﬁguration.

Atmospheric nitrogen is the main natural source of
nitrogen, which makes up about 10 % of the dry mass
of biological matter. Before nitrogen molecules can be
consumed by organisms, they need to be converted into
ammonia, which requires breaking one of the strongest
bonds in nature. For this purpose, biological nitrogen
ﬁxation employs the enzyme nitrogenase. Nitrogenase
consists of two proteins, the Fe protein and the MoFe pro-
tein. The latter contains an Fe7MoS9 cluster as the pro-
posed active site. This so-called FeMo-cofactor has been
named the most complex bioinorganic cofactor in nature.
The crystal structure of nitrogenase was unraveled about
ten years ago[1, 2, 3]. Despite intense research, however,
the reaction mechanism still remains elusive to date.

A puzzling feature of the FeMo-cofactor was the ap-
parent presence of a cavity surrounded by four iron
sites[1, 2, 3]. Most previous ab-initio calculations rested
on the assumption that the cage is empty. Recent crys-
tallographic studies[4], however, identiﬁed the presence
of a central ligand in the cavity, being a C,O, or N atom,
which sheds new light on the mechanism of biological
nitrogen ﬁxation.

The reaction consumes eight electrons and protons and

produces one sacriﬁcial hydrogen molecule[5].

− → 2NH3 + H2

The electron transfer from the Fe protein to the MoFe
protein containing the cofactor is the rate limiting fac-
tor for nitrogen ﬁxation. Electrons are transfered to the
cofactor at a rate of about one to ten per second[6].

A number of reaction mechanisms from nitrogen to am-
monia at the FeMo-cofactor have been proposed. They
can be classiﬁed according to the way N2 binds to the co-
factor: (1) Nitrogen binds head on to one of the six pris-
matic iron atoms in an (η1) coordination[7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
(2) Nitrogen forms a N2 bridge between two octahedrally
coordinated Fe atoms after opening of the cage[12, 13, 14]
and (3) N2 coordinates to Mo[15, 16, 17, 18, 19].

been ruled out with the presence of a central ligand[20].
In this paper we investigate the N2 binding modes to
the FeMo-cofactor using state-of-the-art electronic struc-
ture calculations.
Inclusion of the central nitrogen lig-
and dramatically changes our view of the reaction mech-
anism: The cage of the FeMo cluster opens up upon
binding to nitrogen, supporting earlier suggestions that
the cluster may undergo major rearrangements during
the enzymatic cycle[12]. This indicates that the reaction
mechanism is more complex than previously believed.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that N2 binds to the central cage,
whereas binding to the Mo site, a major contender for
the role as the reactive site of the cluster, is thermody-
namically unstable.

We performed ﬁrst-principles electronic structure cal-
culations based on density functional theory (DFT)[21,
22] using the PBE functional[23]. We employed the
projector-augmented wave method[24] and allowed for a
non-collinear description of the spin distribution. The
latter is important to properly account for the frustrated
antiferromagnetically coupled arrangement of high-spin
Fe atoms. The artiﬁcial interaction between periodic im-
ages of the cluster in our plane-wave based method has
been removed[25].

We considered the complete FeMo-cofactor as shown
in Fig. 1. The central ligand has been chosen to be nitro-
gen. The ligands of the FeMo-cofactor have been trun-
cated such that only single bonds were broken, and the
open bonds were saturated by hydrogen atoms. Thus we

included an imidazole and a glycolate coordinated to the
Mo site to replace the histidine and homocitrate ligands
respectively and an SH group instead of a cysteine group
at the terminal Fe atom of the cofactor.

The interaction of the cofactor with the surrounding
protein has been analyzed using a classical force ﬁeld,
namely the UFF force ﬁeld[26]. The protein structure,
as obtained from the protein data bank entry 1QGU[27],
has been included up to a radius of 10 ˚A and held rigid
beyond a radius of 9 ˚A from FeMoco center and relaxed
inside.

Before exploring the N2 adsorption we need to de-
termine the charge and protonation state of the cofac-
tor. Since the driving forces for protonation and electron
transfer are not known a-priori, we derive them by com-
paring our theoretical with experimental results. This
implies identifying the charge state of the resting state
and to trace the electron and proton transfer steps until
N2 binds.

A reference is provided by the clear S = 3/2 EPR
signal[5] of the resting state. For odd charge states rang-
ing from −5 e to +1 e, we ﬁnd that only the charge state
−3 e, which is collinear, can be clearly identiﬁed with an
S=3/2 spin state. Charges of −1 e as well as +1 e result
in an S=1/2 state, and the charge state of −5 e has a
non-collinear spin distribution with S = 0.24. For the
noncollinear clusters we determined the spin state from
the absolute value of the integrated spin density. Full
structural relaxation in each charge state has been im-
portant for the determination of the correct ground state
as the spin distribution depends sensitively on the atomic
structure.

tributing a change of −3 e. Six iron atoms form pairs
with a parallel spin alignment. The pairs are antifer-
romagnetically coupled with the neighboring Fe sites
as shown in Fig.1. One Fe atom, located next to the
Mo site, remains unpaired and is antiferromagnetically
coupled to all three of its neighbors. Its spin is oriented
in the minority spin direction.

This spin arrangement corresponds to the experimen-
tally observed distribution of four sites aligned with the
main spin direction and three antiparallel sites, as found
in ENDOR[28, 29] and M¨ossbauer[30] studies. It should
be noted that experiments at higher temperatures may
observe an averaged spin structure due to either elec-
tronic or structural ﬂuctuations.

The Fe sites are in a distorted tetrahedral environ-
ment formed by either four S ligands or three S ligands
and the central N-ligand, while the Mo-site is octahe-
drally coordinated. The bonding network is augmented
by metal-metal bonds, derived from the Fe eg and Mo t2g
orbitals. While the metal-metal bonds are fairly delocal-
ized, the best formal assignment is to attribute mixed
valence bonds to the spin paired Fe atoms and those be-

2

tween Mo and its three nearest Fe-neighbors. The mixed-
valence bonds are limited to the minority spin direction of
the participating Fe atoms since the majority spin direc-
tion has a ﬁlled d-shell. This assignment, derived from an
analysis of the oﬀ-site elements of the density-of-states,
accounts for the total charge and spin for the cluster. In
addition it explains the presence of the small magnetic
moment of Mo antiparallel to the main spin direction.

Given the good agreement of our calculated atomic
structure for the unprotonated cofactor with X-ray[4]
and EXAFS[31, 32] experiments, as opposed to the pro-
tonated cofactor, we conclude that the resting state is
indeed unprotonated.

In order to understand N2 adsorption, one needs to
know the number of protons bound to the cofactor. A
reasonable assumption used in our analysis is that the
proton transfer rate is fast compared to the slow electron
transfer[33, 34, 35, 36]. This implies that the protona-
tion state reaches thermal equilibrium before the next
electron is transfered. The protonation state is then de-
termined by the proton chemical potential reﬂecting the
acidity of the cavity containing the cofactor. The pro-
ton chemical potential, not accessible in our calculation,
will then be calibrated by comparing our ﬁndings with
experiment.

In order to determine protonation of the cofactor, we
investigated the protonation energies of all relevant pro-
In
ton acceptor sites for the singly reduced cofactor.
accordance with previous calculations without central
ligand[37], we ﬁnd that only the bridging sulfur atoms
are protonated. Proton addition to the Fe atoms or the
µ3 sulfur atoms is less favorable by 0.2 eV and 0.5 eV,
respectively. A proton added to the Fe-site converts into
a hydride (H−), which can react with a second proton to
form a hydrogen molecule.

As obtained from collinear calculations, the proton
chemical potential increases by approximately 2.7 eV per
proton added to the sulfur bridges and decreases by the
same amount for each electron added. This shows that a
single proton is added to the cofactor for each additional
electron in a ping-pong like manner. Note that the dielec-
tric screening by the environment aﬀects the diﬀerences
of the calculated protonation energies, but not the qual-
itative ﬁnding of a ping-pong mechanism.

The proton transfer is reﬂected in a structural change
of the cofactor that provides us with a means to relate
the protonation state of the cluster to experiment. While
electron transfer alone does not change the structure of
the cofactor appreciably in our calculations, the proto-
nation decreases the angle of the sulfur bridges, which
in turn contracts the cluster. EXAFS measurements in-
dicate that the cluster contracts upon reduction by one
electron for Azotobacter vinelandii[32], while no signif-
icant changes have been found for Klebsiella pneumo-
niae[38]. The fact that proton transfer, as apparent by
the contraction, depends on subtle changes of the pro-

tein allows us to identify the proton chemical potential
approximately with the ﬁrst protonation energy of the
cofactor reduced by one electron. Knowing the chemi-
cal potential we can essentially predict the sequence of
electron and proton transfers.

FIG. 2: Structures of the three N2 binding modes investigated
in this work: the open axial mode (top), the bridged mode
(middle) and Mo-coordination (bottom).

We have investigated N2 binding after transfer of one
and two electrons with the corresponding number of pro-
tons. Our calculations indicate that N2 binds only in
the latter case. Our result that N2 binds to the doubly
protonated cofactor seems to disagree with Thorneley-
Lowe scheme[34, 35, 36] which predicts that 3-4 elec-
trons reach the MoFe-protein before N2 binding. How-
ever, EPR measurements during turnover[6] indicate that
only two of the three ﬁrst electrons transfered to the pro-
tein actually reach the cofactor. Thus we need to add one
electron (and one proton) before comparing our results
for the cofactor with the Thorneley-Lowe scheme.

On the basis of the doubly reduced cofactor, we inves-
tigated several binding modes of N2: On the faces of the
central cage, in the bridging position between Mo and Fe,
at the Mo site and at the Fe-atoms of the central cage
in the axial, equatorial and side-on orientations. All of
these complexes have been previously discussed and in-
vestigated theoretically for the complex without the cen-
tral nitrogen ligand. According to our calculation only
the adsorption to an Fe atom on the central cage is stable.
Upon adsorption of N2 to an Fe-site next to a proto-
nated sulfur bridge, we ﬁnd that the sulfur bridge breaks
so that the cage structure of the cofactor is disrupted.

3

Adsorption and cage opening occur in a concerted mech-
anism. The resulting structure is shown in Fig 2. The
barrier for N2 adsorption is 0.29 eV, which can be over-
come easily by thermal ﬂuctuations. The binding energy
is 0.27 eV.

For the cofactor without central ligand, Rod et al.[9]
found that N2 binds in an axial mode to the same Fe-site,
but the cage structure of the cofactor remained intact
in these calculations. We ﬁnd that this result changes
radically when the central nitrogen ligand is included.
Compared to the metastable structure analogous to that
of Rod et al., the cage opening stabilizes N2 binding by
0.55 eV, indicating that N2 does not bind unless the sulfur
bridge breaks away. The structure with a closed cage is
metastable, with a small barrier of only 0.1 eV towards
the ground state.

With an N-H distance of 2.8 ˚A, the SH group seems to
be well positioned for the ﬁrst protonation of dinitrogen,
which is believed to have the largest energy barrier in the
catalytic cycle. However, according to our calculations,
this proton transfer is energetically not favorable.

The axial binding mode is not the only possible con-
ﬁguration for the N2 complex with the FeMo-cofactor.
We ﬁnd that dinitrogen can tilt to form a dinitrogen
bridge between the two Fe atoms formerly bridged by
a SH group. As dinitrogen binds to the second Fe atom,
the bond of this Fe atom to the central ligand breaks,
so that the tetrahedral coordination of the Fe atom is
retained. This bridging conﬁguration shown in Fig. 2 is
energetically more stable by 0.08 eV than the open axial
mode. The reaction barrier of 0.68 eV corresponds to a
reaction rate somewhat smaller than the electron trans-
fer rate from the Fe protein the MoFe protein. Thus
both structures, with an axial and bridged dinitrogen are
equally likely intermediates for the N2 ﬁxation cycle.

A similar adsorption mode with N2 bridging two Fe
sites has been proposed earlier by Sellmann et al.[13] Sell-
mann’s model diﬀers from our bridged complex in that
the Fe sites are octahedrally coordinated, instead of the
tetrahedral coordination in our cluster. The diﬀerent co-
ordination reﬂects in a major change of the electronic
structure: The octahedral complex results in low-spin
Fe atoms while the tetrahedral coordination results in
high-spin Fe-atoms, which have diﬀerent chemical be-
havior. The chemical analogy to octahedral low-spin
complexes[39] has been one of the main reasons for Sell-
mann’s proposal.

The additional ligands in Sellmann’s model are wa-
ter molecules and the nitrogen atoms from two amino
acids of the protein, glutamine Glnα191 and histidine
Hisα195[40]. We have investigated the model proposed
by Sellmann by modeling the nitrogen ligands with
ammonia molecules. We ﬁnd this structure at least
metastable in the absence of the central nitrogen ligand.
Addition of the central ligand, however, results in the
spontaneous desorption of the three water ligands from

the two bridged Fe sites. The ammonia ligands remain
bound to the Fe sites, so that the latter assume a penta-
coordinate coordination with high-spin iron atoms.

An important question is if the protein environment is
able to accommodate the expansion of the cage after N2
binding. Therefore we embedded the rigid FeMo-cofactor
as obtained from our calculations into the protein simu-
lated with classical force ﬁelds.

The cofactor with N2 adsorbed at sites Fe3 and Fe7
can easily be accommodated both in the open-cage and
in the bridged conﬁguration. There is also suﬃcient space
to accommodate N2 bound to Fe6, even though the em-
bedding energy is 1 eV higher than that for N2 bound to
Fe3 or Fe7. The presence of a nearby imidazole ring of
the protein (Hisα195)[40] prevents the transition to the
bridged conﬁguration as well as adsorption to site Fe2.
Binding at sites Fe4 and Fe5 can be excluded, because
either the dinitrogen or the SH group collides with the
protein backbone in close proximity of site Fe4.

We conclude that the adsorption complexes can be ac-
commodated in the central cage. The most likely adsorp-
tion sites are Fe3 and Fe7. Given the uncertainties of the
force ﬁeld calculations we do not explicitely exclude ad-
sorption to Fe6.

Coordination of N2 to Mo has been discussed in great
detail in the literature[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. While the
molybdenum atom in the cofactor stands out, it is not
essential. There are other nitrogenases, where the Mo
atom of the cofactor is replaced by V or Fe. While their
eﬃciency is reduced their mere existence indicates that
the Mo-site is not essential.

The Mo atom is octahedrally coordinated to three sul-
fur sites of the cofactor, to two oxygen atoms of homoci-
trate and to the nitrogen atom of a histidine. N2 associ-
ation on the Mo atom is initiated by a proton transfer to
the carboxyl group of homocitrate. After protonation,
the Mo-O bond becomes very labile. Nevertheless, N2
binding to the vacant coordination site at Mo is unstable
by 0.31-0.34 eV irrespective of the protonation state of
the carboxyl group of homocitrate. While hydrophobic
forces of the environment, not considered in this work,
may increase the aﬃnity to N2, the presence of more sta-
ble binding modes at the Fe sites provides strong evidence
that the mechanism does not proceed at the Mo site.

Our ﬁnding that binding of N2 at the Mo site is unfa-
vorable diﬀers from previous conclusions[17, 18] derived
from smaller model systems. This diﬀerence has been
traced to the small cluster size, that is 1-2 metal sites,
used in those calculations.

In this work, we analyzed the N2 adsorption at the
FeMo-cofactor of nitrogenase containing the recently de-
tected central nitrogen ligand. Special attention has been
given to oxidation states and the sequence of electron and
proton transfer steps. We ﬁnd that N2 binding results in
a disruption of the cage structure of the FeMo-cofactor.
In contrast to the obvious assumption that the central

4

ligand adds rigidity to the cofactor, the additional ni-
trogen atom oﬀers a variable number of bonds to its Fe
neighbors and thus adds ﬂexibility to the structure.

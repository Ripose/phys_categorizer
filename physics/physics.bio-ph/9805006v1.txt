Abstract

We study the Fisher model describing natural selection in a popula-
tion with a diploid structure of a genome by diﬀerential- geometric meth-
ods. For the selection dynamics we introduce an aﬃne connection which is
shown to be the projectively Euclidean and the equiaﬃne one. The selec-
tion dynamics is reformulated similar to the motion of an eﬀective particle
moving along the geodesic lines in an ’eﬀective external ﬁeld’ of a tensor
type. An exact solution is found to the Fisher equations for the special
case of ﬁtness matrix associated to the eﬀect of chromosomal imprinting
of mammals. Biological sense of the diﬀerential- geometric constructions
is discussed. The aﬃne curvature is considered as a direct consequence of
an allele coupling in the system. This curving of the selection dynamics
geometry is related to an inhomogenity of the time ﬂow in the course of
the selection.

Key words: population dynamics, natural selection

1 Introduction

The selection dynamics in biological populations was usually investigated by the
methods of the dynamic system theory. Apart from simple cases of explicit
integrability, the basic problem in such an approach is to ﬁnd attractors of various
types and to study the stability problem [2]. A survey of basic results of the
several past decades can be found in monographs [3, 5, 4].

In common practice of selection dynamics, the geometric methods do not at-
tract too much attention, although the importance is stressed sometimes [5, 6].

On the other hand, these methods have demonstrated their eﬃciency in theo-

trend to formulate dynamical principles (having structural resemblance to the
respective biological relations) in terms of diﬀerential geometry and Lie algebra.
Geometric and algebraic methods provide both suitable mathematical construc-
tions bringing a system to integrability and they facilitate the study of global
characteristics of the system. From this standpoint the geometric framework may
have considerable interest for the mathematical models of biological systems.

Population models of biological societies display a natural hierarchy regarding
to the degree and the character of coupling between system components. In the
most general form, the population dynamics should be considered in the context
of the ecological system dynamics. The population enters the system as a single
element connected with the rest ones by trophic, compete and other links. The
system state is characterized by its number, by genetic structure, by age and sex
distribution and some other quantities. A complete description of the selection
dynamics (the change of the population genetic structure) implies to consider
a multi-locus system with all the genes involved in the selection process. To
simplify the problem we may consider a single- locus model. A classical example
of such a case is the well known Fisher model describing a coupling of alleles of the
given locus in the course of the selection. The Darwin system model suggested
by Eigen [7] is an utmost case of this simpliﬁcation. It realizes the basic idea of
the natural selection: a diﬀerential survive of convariantly self-reduplicating units
(according to Timofeev-Resovskii nomenclature [8]), is realized in this model.

In Ref.

[9] we develop Hamiltonian form and thereby simplectic geometric
description for the selection dynamics in the populations with haploid structure
of a genome (when any gene is represented in a single instance (single allele)).

In the geometric framework the evolution of the Darwin system with a stable
organization is represented as a motion with a constant velocity in an Euclidean
plane space of information variables. This is a result of absence of a coupling
between separate genotypes (quasispecies, by Eigen) in the course of the selection.
In the given work the diﬀerential- geometrical methods are applied to the
Fisher model which is one of the upper level in the above hierarchy with respect to
the Eigen model. The Fisher model describes the natural selection in populations
with diploid structure of a genome. In this model, the necessary condition for the
reproduction (and therefore the selection) of the individuals in the population,
is a pairwise coupling of separate haploid genotypes (gametes) by the zigote
formation, i.e. the cells or the organisms with the diploid (double) gene setting.
The gamete coupling in the population is considered by the Fisher model in terms
of pairwise coupling of diﬀerent alleles of the single gene (single-locus model) or
many genes (multi-locus model) being inherited by the individual from its parents.
The basic aim of the paper is to clarify the question how the allele coupling
creates the geometry of the space associated with the selection dynamics. We
introduce an aﬃne connection related to the ﬁrst derivative of the Fisher equa-

2

tions in the population variables space. The aﬃne connection is turn out to be
projectively Euclidean one and simultaneously it is an equiaﬃne connection. The
above derivative is presented in the form of equations of motion of an eﬀective
particle moving along the geodesic lines in an ’eﬀective external ﬁeld’ of a tensor
type. The Fisher equations are integrated for the ﬁtness matrix of a special form
associated with the phenomenon of chromosomal imprinting and diﬀerentional
methylation of DNA in the course of the gamete maturation of mammals [10]. In
this case the Fisher dynamics is reduced to the dynamics of the Darwin system
by a suitable replace of time variable. An approximate solution is constructed in
the weak ’external ﬁeld’. The equiaﬃnity is shown to result in the conservation of
a volume in the population space with respect to the geodesic ﬂows. The volume
is deﬁned using a certain density of the aﬃne space.

Mention that the curving of the Euclidean ﬂat space of informational variables
is the eﬀect of the allele coupling in the system. This curving could be also
interpreted as an eﬀect of the inhomogenity of the time ﬂow in the in the course
of the selection.

2 The Fisher model

Consider a population where the success of reproductivity (and therefore the se-
lection dynamics) is determined by a single gene (locus) having N alleles. Denote
by pα a portion of α-allele in the population, α, β, . . . = 1, . . . , N. Evidently

Choose the quantities pα as population variables. Then the Fisher system is
written as [1]:

˙pα = pα(

ωαβpβ −

ωµνpµpν).

Here ˙pα = dpα(t)/dt, t is the time. The quantity

is the speciﬁc rate of reproduction of α−th allele, and

is an average speciﬁc rate of the population growth as a whole. The matrix ωαβ
(= const) in the population biology is identiﬁed to the ﬁtness matrix associated

the variables

zi = ln

.

Here and below i, j, k, . . . = 1, . . . , N − 1. The meaning of the variables zi is that
they reﬂect an information quantity per a degree of freedom in the population in
the frame of Shannon formalism [11] (we mean the information about the genetic
structure of the population).

Theorem 1 In the variables (3) the Fisher system (2) is reduced to the form:
˙zi = αi + Pk βik exp(zk)

.

1 + Ω

Here,

αi = ωiN − ωN N ,
Ω = Pk exp(zk).

βik = ωik − ωN k − ωiN + ωN N ,

Proof.

Introducing the auxiliary variables yα = ln pα, we have from (1):

Pα exp(yα) = 1. Then exp(yN ) = 1 − Pk exp(yk). It is easy to verify that

exp(zi) =

exp(yi)
1 − Pk exp(yk)

Writing Eqs. (7) for α = i and for α = N and subtracting one from another, we
obtain (4) using (6).

is represented as a pure curving of the population variable space.
It is con-
nected with the following form of the ﬁtness matrix ωαβ in the Fisher system (2):
ωij = ωN j, j 6= N; ωiN 6= ωjN , i 6= j. As a variant of a real genetic system result-
ing in such form of the matrix ωαβ we can suggest a system with the chromosomal
imprinting found in the course of the gametogenesis of mammals. According to
[10], the result of the imprinting is that the same allele is included into a genome
of a zigote in active or in non-active state. The allele activity depends on its
aﬃliation to the DNA of male or female gamete. Molecular mechanism of the
chromosomal imprinting is based on the diﬀerential methylation of DNA in the
course of the gamete maturation.
For weak ’external ﬁeld’ Ai

αi + βik = εγik,

ε ≪ 1,

(16)

(αi, βik are of the form (5)) the analysis of the motion can be carried out in two
steps. First, we consider the motion along the geodesic lines, then we account for
the ’external ﬁeld’ Ai

k perturbatively.

Putting ε = 0, we see that the restrictions being imposed by Eqs. (4) on the

Let us now integrate Eqs. (18) under the condition (20). Without loss of gener-
ality, we can assume

cj = αj.

zj = αjϕ(t) + bj.

Here bj are the integration constants, and the function ϕ(t) is determined by the

5 Conclusion

Discuss a biological sence of the parameters αi, βij in (4). If βij = 0 then the
system (4) is reduced to the dynamics of haploid populations. A detail analysis of
such systems was performed in [9]. The parameters αi in this case have a meaning
of speciﬁc rates of reproduction of separate genotypes (the Maltusian parameters
in ecological terms). Thus, it is the matrix βij (not the complete matrix ωαβ)
which is eﬀectively responsible for the alleles coupling. It is not evident from the
original Fisher system (2). The allele coupling is represented as a curvature in
the geometry of the population variable space. The tensor (12) is the measure
of this curvature and it is completely determined by the value ln(1 + Ω). Note
that this value is expressed in the population variables in the following form:
ln(1 + Ω) = ln(1/pN ). In its turn, ln(1/pN ) is a measure of an information of
the N−th allele in the population by Shannon. It is clear, the more rarely the
N−th allele occurs in the population the larger is the curvature of the space
associated with the selection dynamics. Let us also emphasize that the basic
geometrical characteristic of this space is completely determined by encounter
frequency of N-th allele. Among all the possible variants of the matrices ωαβ, a
particular interest has the case ε = 0 in (16) when the system (4) is integrated
explicitly and its solution is reduced to the uniform rectilinear motion (24) by the
redeﬁnition of time variable. This case is similar to the Eigen selection dynamics
in haploid populations and, as it is shown in [9], admits the Hamiltonian form
of the dynamic equations. Let us note that in this case the allele coupling is
eﬀectively reduces to time ﬂow change according to (23).

We investigated the nanometer scale height ﬂuctuations of 3T3 ﬁbroblast cells with the atomic
force microscope (AFM) under physiological conditions. Correlation between these ﬂuctuations and
lateral cellular motility can be observed. Fluctuations measured on leading edges appear to be
predominantly related to actin polymerization-depolymerization processes. We found fast (5 Hz)
pulsatory behavior with 1–2 nm amplitude on a cell with low motility showing emphasized structure
of stress ﬁbres. Myosin driven contractions of stress ﬁbres are thought to induce this pulsation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The motility of animal cells is dominated by actin-
myosin-based contraction and actin polymerization-
based protrusion.
The two basic types of protru-
sions,
lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia are driven by actin
polymerization-depolymerization processes [1, 2, 3]. The
physical theory of such biological motilities employing
the tools of statistical physics [4, 5] gives an idea how it
works but it still needs to be developed.

A number of cellular activities can cause height ﬂuc-
tuations on the time and distance scales that we investi-
gated. Actin polymerization and actin-myosin based con-
tractions represent only one class. The rearrangement of
the structure built up from intermediate ﬁlaments (IF)
under the plasma membrane can be another source of
vertical ﬂuctuations.
IF-s provide mechanical stability
to animal cells. Any signiﬁcant weakening of the IF ar-
ray alters at least locally the elastic properties of the cell
leading to increased susceptibility to intrinsic or extrin-
sic forces. Assembly or disassembly of large protein com-
plexes in the plasma membrane or their lateral motion
under the AFM tip will also result in vertical motility,
not to mention endo- and exocytotic activity. Intracellu-
lar transport processes can have an eﬀect on the vertical
ﬂuctuations, as well.

Cellular motility on the micrometer scale has been ex-
tensively investigated with video-microscopy ([6, 7, 8]
and references therein). Spatial resolution provided by
optical microscopy of living cells, however does not enable
researchers to observe nanometer scale motion and rear-
rangement of cell components. AFM is an adequate tool
for such measurements [9, 10, 11, 12]. Stress ﬁbres (con-
tractile bundles of actin ﬁlaments and myosin-II) play an
important role in the control of cell shape and the ad-
hesion of cells to the extracellular matrix through focal
contacts. These characteristic cytoskeletal elements can

be imaged with the AFM due to their high elastic modu-
lus [13, 14]. AFM is capable not only for recording high-
resolution topographic images of living cells but also for
measuring the elastic properties of them simultaneously
[15] and investigating cellular dynamics [16, 17].

By repetitively scanning on the surface of a cell time-
lapse images can be recorded [18, 19]. The analysis of
subsequent images yielding a movie is highly informative
in terms of the kinetics of the cytoskeleton. Although
fast cellular motility can not be examined by the repeti-
tive scanning procedure due to the minute-range of scan-
ning time, nanometer scale fast motion can be probed by
positioning the tip on the area of interest. In this way
vertical ﬂuctuations can be investigated almost without
a limitation of the time scale.

Close to the molecular scale the motion of cells is domi-
nated by stochastic ﬂuctuations. With the AFM we tried
to shed light on the linkage between microscopic ﬂuctu-
ations and organized motility.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. Cell Culture

3T3 mouse ﬁbroblasts were cultured in DMEM supple-
mented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO), 100 units/ml
penicillin G, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.75 µg/ml
Amphotericin B (SIGMA) at 37 ◦C, in a 5% CO2 at-
mosphere. A few days before AFM measurements cells
were subcultured on 13-mm glass cover slips.

B. Atomic Force Microscopy

We investigated the nanometer scale motion of 3T3
mouse ﬁbroblast cells in culture. Diﬀerent cells (C6 rat

glioma) giving similar — unpublished — results were also
examined.

A commercial AFM (TopoMetrix Explorer, Santa
Clara, CA) with custom-made sample heating control
system and ﬂuid chamber was used. Measurements were
carried out at 37 ◦C in CO2 independent medium con-
taining 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO). We used soft
silicon nitride cantilevers (Thermomicroscopes, Coated
Sharp Microlevers, Model # MSCT-AUHW, with typi-
cal force constant 0.01–0.03 N/m, 20 nm radius of curva-
ture). Topographic and deﬂection images were acquired
in contact mode. High-resolution images were acquired
at a scanning frequency of ∼4 Hz. Non-destructive low
force scanning provided stable sustained imaging of liv-
ing cells for 8–10 hours. After AFM experiments cells
were maintained in the same medium for 1–2 days and
found to be normal. We could not achieve high-resolution
imaging on a portion of cells due to their increased height
or softness.

Considering that small details of cellular components
can be observed at the best quality on shaded deﬂection
mode images we present our experimental data in this
format. Topographic images provide height information
but with poor contrast.

On the basis of consecutive images local lateral velocity
of cells was calculated. At the edges of cells we measured
the average displacement of the contour. In the middle of
cells we chose some structures with characteristic shape
and the lateral displacements of these structures were
measured.

The measurement of local height ﬂuctuations of cells
was started at least 1/2 hour after mounting the sample
into the ﬂuid cell. In this way thermal transient eﬀects
could be eliminated. After each scanning the tip was
positioned onto the point of interest with the same force
and feedback parameters and we captured the DC voltage
of the z-piezo by a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS
210) for 22.5 seconds with 100 Hz sampling rate.

III. RESULTS

Distinct types of cellular motility could be examined

by the measurement of vertical ﬂuctuations.

FIG. 1 displays 2 images of a movie showing the slight
motility of the rear edge of a cell with a 4.5 minutes
time shift. This cell was almost quiescent during the
experiment with a highly stable structure of cytoskeletal
ﬁbres and moderate lateral motility. The rear edge is
being pulled by the stress ﬁbres: see the parallel set of
curved ﬁbres anchored to the edge of the cell.
In the
same time cell-matrix junctions or nonspeciﬁc contacts
adhering the rear of the cell to the support weaken and
break. We also observed a typical retracting triangular
shaped 20 µm wide contact (image not shown) of the
same cell at the rear edge. The contact was broken a few
minutes after recording the vertical ﬂuctuations.

Typical vertical ﬂuctuations registered on these two lo-

2

cations are presented in FIG. 2. We suppose that the ap-
parent diﬀerence between vertical ﬂuctuations originates
in the diﬀerent biological activities of the two regions.
While the entire region of the cell shown in FIG. 1 was
extremely stable with a lateral velocity of about 2 nm/s,
the edge beside the retracting triangular shaped contact
moved with a speed of about 11 nm/s.

To analyze height ﬂuctuations we calculated the power
spectrum and the height-height correlation function with
a maximal τ =5 s time shift of each x(t) height-time curve:

y2

(τ ) = X
t

(x(t) − x(t + τ ))
N

2

, t = i∆t, i = 1..N,

(1)

N ∆t = 22.5 − 5s

(2)

where ∆t (10 ms) is the sampling time.

This function can characterize stochastic height ﬂuc-
tuations by giving the average change of height as a
function of time. Curves are presented in FIG. 3, the
number of measured height-time curves n is indicated.
The lateral velocity of each location seems to correlate
with the saturation value of the height-height correla-
tion function measured at that location conﬁrming our
assumption that height ﬂuctuations are related to local
biological activity (motility). The starting slopes of the
curves give the speed of fast ﬂuctuations. Curves saturate
with diﬀerent characteristic (saturation) times. There
is an apparent diﬀerence between curves (a) and (b) in
the saturation value. The characteristic time (∼2 s) of
curve (a’) is approximately double those of the other two
curves. Curve (a’) was registered on the middle region
(cell body) of the quiescent cell. (See Table I.) Charac-
teristic time and saturation value are related to the av-
erage duration and amplitude respectively of an upward
or downward motion.

The analysis of power spectra (FIG. 4) of the height-
time curves acquired on each location of this quiescent
cell revealed sustained periodic ﬂuctuations during the
experiment (1.5 hours). We found a characteristic peak
at 4.9 Hz with a width of 3.5 Hz. The area of this peak
gives an average amplitude of 1.5 ± 0.4 nm. Cells without
apparent stress ﬁbres nearby lack this peak. The origin
of the sharp peaks in the spectrum is electric noise.

FIG. 5 shows the contours of a leading edge of a motile
cell from consecutive images. Note the bright spot (S) ap-
pearing on the cell surface close to the edge in the middle
of the second image. It appears in less than 7 minutes
and disappears soon after. A similar one can be observed
on the upper part of the last image. These features seem
to be linked to the ends of curved ﬁlaments.
In many
cases micrometer sized unidentiﬁed nodes were found on
stress ﬁbres. They might be large protein complexes at-
tached to F-actin.

FIG. 2 displays the height-time curves captured on
the leading edge (c) and close to that on the cell body

(d). Curves show increased motility especially on the
long (several seconds) time scale. As a consequence, the
saturation eﬀect of the height-height correlation function
disappears on this scale (FIG. 3). The speed of fast ﬂuc-
tuations is higher, as well. (See Table I.) We suppose
that the observed increase in vertical ﬂuctuations is an
outcome of actin polymerization-depolymerization pro-
cesses at the leading edge. Surprisingly, the height-height
correlation function shows a higher level of ﬂuctuations
farther from the leading edge. It can be a result of actin
depolymerization processes well behind the edge or an
increased temporal motility of this region which has to
follow the edge.

IV. DISCUSSION

The analysis of height ﬂuctuations acquired at diﬀer-
ent locations allows a sensitive monitoring of the motil-
ity of cellular components. Both actin-myosin based
contractions and actin polymerization-based ﬁlopodial
and lamellipodial protrusions can be examined by this
method. We found a correlation between the character-
istics of vertical ﬂuctuation and organized lateral loco-
motion.

We explain the observed 5 Hz pulsation of a cell with
the periodic contractions of stress ﬁbres. This type of os-
cillation cannot be easily identiﬁed by other techniques
due to its low amplitude. Although the frequency of me-
chanical pulsation of cardiomyocytes is in the same fre-
quency range (∼1.25 Hz), its amplitude is 2 orders of
magnitude higher [16]. Spontaneous oscillatory contrac-

tions of muscle ﬁbers with a period of a few seconds are
widely known for several years (e.g.
[20]). Theoretical
models can explain spontaneous oscillation under certain
conditions [21]).

Slow pulsation of non-muscle cells has been observed in
several cases. Microtubule depolymerization can induce
rhythmic actomyosin-based contractility with a period
of ∼50 s in ﬁbroblasts [22] and oscillatory activity in
the cortical microﬁlament system of lymphoblasts [23].
Shape oscillations of leukocytes driven by cyclic actin
polymerization has been studied by several groups [24].
The period of this process is about ∼8 s.

The cortical tension of non-muscle cells generated by
myosin-II can drive a change of shape [25]. Myosin
molecules cycle about 5 times in a second in muscle [26].
Based on the above mentioned facts, we think that a syn-
chronized behavior of myosin molecules in stress ﬁbres
may cause the observed pulsation. Myosin synchroniza-
tion has been theoretically predicted close to the isomet-
ric condition in highly organized actin structures [27, 28].
Further experiments are needed to elucidate the back-
ground of this phenomenon. Using drugs aﬀecting a spe-
ciﬁc system of the cytoskeleton will help to distinguish
their roles in the nanometer scale ﬂuctuations of cells.

FIG. 2: Typical vertical ﬂuctuations measured on quiescent and motile cells. Graph (a) and (b) belong to the quiescent, (c)
and (d) to the motile cell. We recorded (a) on the rear edge displayed in FIG. 1. (b) was measured on a typical retracting
triangular shaped contact (image not shown) of the cell at the rear edge. This contact to the support was broken a few minutes
after recording the vertical ﬂuctuations. (c) and (d) were registered on the leading edge shown in FIG. 5 and close to that on
the cell body respectively.

FIG. 3: Averaged height-height correlation functions of ﬂuctuations measured on the surface of the quiescent and the motile
cell. Curves (a, n=10); (b, n=8); (c, n=10) and (d, n=9) are the corresponding correlation functions of vertical ﬂuctuations
shown in FIG. 2. Curve (a’, n=10) was registered on the middle region of the quiescent cell. There is an apparent diﬀerence
between the behavior of curves belonging to the quiescent and the motile cell. Saturation disappears on the scale of several
seconds in case of the motile cell. This fact indicates the presence of vertical motility on this time scale. Signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between graph (a) and (b) is attributed to the dynamics of the retracting contact at the rear edge. See the value of lateral
velocity of locations at each curve. 50 Hz noise on curves can be observed.

FIG. 4: Power spectrum (n=10) of height ﬂuctuations measured at the location shown in FIG. 1. The peak at 4.9 Hz can be
found in each power spectrum of height ﬂuctuations captured on the surface of the quiescent cell. The power spectra of height
ﬂuctuations of cells without apparent stress ﬁbres nearby lack this peak.

indicates the direction of motion. Note the bright spot (S) appearing on the cell surface close to the edge in the middle of the
second image. L: lamellipodium, F: ﬁlopodium. Contour lines (extreme right) display the forward motion of the edge. The
standard deviation of lateral velocity was found to be higher than in the case of a less mobile edge due to extensions growing
with high speed, such as the extension on the lower region of the last contour line corresponding to the right hand image.

Abstract

Introduction

Motivation: The majority of work in the analysis of
microarray data has focused on improving the signal
to noise ratio in the low concentration region. How-
ever, improvements are also possible at the opposite
extreme: at high concentrations. This problem ap-
pears to have been neglected for two reasons: ﬁrst,
it is counter-intuitive to expect problems in what ap-
pears to be the cleanest region and second, the data
necessary to identify and develop improvements has
not been widely available. Fortunately, the situation
has changed and precise calibration data produced by
Aﬀymetrix which enables the analysis of signals over
a broad range of concentrations. Using this data,
we address the question: “Where on the concentra-
tion/intensity scale are we able (or unable) to detect
fold changes of 2 and greater?”

Results: First, we empirically demonstrate that
while current techniques are capable of detecting
changes in the low to middle concentration range, the
situation is quite diﬀerent for high concentrations.
Speciﬁcally,
in this regime, expression changes as
large as 4 fold are severely compressed, and changes
of 2 are often undetectable. However, a feature of
GeneChips is that transcripts are probed by a set of
sequence fragments having a wide range of aﬃnities.
The key to improving the accuracy in a given inten-
sity range, is choosing those probes that are most
responsive in that range. Utilizing this property and
borrowing ideas from the theory of local linear em-
beddings (LLE) we present a new approach capable
of reducing the compression at high intensity.

High-density oligonucleotide arrays manufactured by
Aﬀymetrix are currently among the most sensitive
and reliable microarray technology (Chee et al., 1996;
Lipshutz et al., 1999) available. Based on a pho-
tolithographic oligonucleotide deposition process, la-
beled and ampliﬁed mRNA transcripts are probed by
28-40 short DNA sequence each 25 bases long. The
probes are preferentially picked near the 3’ end of
the mRNA sequence, because of the limited eﬃcien-
cies of reverse transcription enzymes. In addition, the
probes come in two varieties: half are perfect matches
(PM ) identical to templates found in databases, and
the other half are single mismatches (MM ), carry-
ing a single base substitution in the middle (13th)
base of the sequence. MM probes were introduced to
serve as controls for non-speciﬁc hybridization, and
is was thought that the actual signal (the target’s
mRNA concentration) would be proportional to the
diﬀerence of match versus mismatch (PM-MM ). We
shall conﬁrm below that as a ﬁrst approximation, this
subtraction procedure is the most reasonable choice,
leading to remarkably good results in the low to mid
concentration range. However, we shall show that for
high concentrations, the signal tends to be suppressed
when using diﬀerentials.

This result is likely to sound surprising and
counter-intuitive to many, which we believe is rooted
in the following widespread interpretation of hy-
bridization data. Namely, when examining a typ-
ical plot of the data from two replicated conditions
(Figure 1a) most would immediately focus on the low
intensity region, and observe how noisy this regime
appears to be in comparison to the much cleaner high-
intensity range. However, matters turn out to be
more complex and we shall argue this view is at least
partly incorrect and often misleading. Turning to a
comparison of two diﬀerent conditions (Figure 1b),
we notice that the noise envelope is essentially un-
changed, and that real changes appear as points lying

1

distinctively outside the noise cloud. Repeating this
exercise on many diﬀerent conditions, we would then
conclude that the high intensity data is almost always
very tightly scattered about the diagonal, and that
there are rarely genes in that region that show fold
changes greater than, say, 1.5 or 2. Should we then
conclude that there is no interesting biology occur-
ring at high intensities, or perhaps that all highly ex-
pressed genes are “house keeping” genes? The answer
is probably no. In fact we shall show evidence that
the high-intensity regime is strongly compressive, and
that real changes are often hidden. This saturation
eﬀect can actually be observed in Aﬀymetrix’s own
data1 although the issue is not discussed there.

The explanation for the compression eﬀect invokes
non-linear probe aﬃnities and chemical saturation,
which are not saturation eﬀects resulting from the
photodetector threshold. Issues related to photode-
tection saturation present a separate problem, and
they have essentially been ﬁxed by Aﬀymetrix by low-
ering the laser intensity during scans. On the other
hand, chemical saturation occurs below the detec-
tor threshold and is attributed to the fact that some
probes will exhaust their binding capacities at rela-
tively low concentrations, simply because their bind-
ing aﬃnities are high. Binding aﬃnities are in fact
very sensitive to the sequence composition, resulting
in measured brightnesses that usually vary by several
orders of magnitude within a given probeset (Naef
et al., 2002). In addition, the systematic preference
30% of targets to the MM probes (measured MM
of
intensities larger than PM’s) has caused widespread
confusion. Reasons for this phenomenon seem to lie
beyond the anticipated decrease in binding energies
resulting from the single substitution (Bonnet et al.,
1999; Vesnaver & Breslauer, 1991).

≈

After presenting a detailed performance study of
extant analysis methods, we present a method that
achieves higher sensitivity at the high intensity end.
The methods is based on the notion that the probe-
sets (PM and MM ) should be considered as a set with
a broad range of aﬃnities, rather than the traditional
interpretation of the PM’s being the signals and the
MM’s being non-speciﬁc controls. Indeed, it has be-
come clear that the MM probes also track the signal,
usually with lower (although often with higher) aﬃni-
ties than the PM’s. In that sense, the MM’s should
be viewed as a set of on average lower aﬃnity probes.
Having this in mind, it is then reasonable to expect
that some MM probes will track the signal better at
higher intensities because they will not saturate as

rapidly as the PM’s (cf. ﬁg 3).

Methods

The existing methods for the analysis of the raw
data fall into two main classes. The ﬁrst methods
are similar to Aﬀymetrix’s Microarray Suite software,
providing absolute intensities on a chip by chip ba-
sis, or diﬀerential expression ratios from two exper-
iments (Aﬀymetrix, 2001; Naef et al., 2001; Naef
et al., 2002). The second class are called “model-
based” approaches (Li & Wong, 2001), and attempt
to ﬁt the probe aﬃnities from a large number of ex-
periments.
It is natural to expect that the second
class should lead to more accurate results as it in-
corporates more data into the analysis; however, the
ﬁrst methods are still necessary as not every labo-
ratory can aﬀord to run the ideal number of 16-20
required chips at once. Our new method belongs to
the second class and is based on ideas borrowed from
the theory of locally linear embeddings (Roweis &
Saul, 2000).

Principal component analysis

Loosely speaking local embeddings are necessary
because the non-linearities (resulting from chemi-
cal saturation) aﬀect the one-dimensional manifold
PM j(c), MM j(c)
(the concentration c is the one-
{
}
dimensional ’curve’ parameter) by giving it a non-
zero local curvature. The results section contains am-
ple evidence that these non-linearities are signiﬁcant.
Our method is a multidimensional generalization of
the schematic depicted in Figure 2, which shows the
typical situation of two probes in which one of the
probes (PM 2) saturates at concentrations lower than
the other. If both probes were perfectly linear, the
curve would be a straight line with slope 1. In the
multidimensional case, the directions of largest vari-
ation (analogous to D1 or D2 in Figure 2) are com-
puted from the principal components of the matrix

which can easily be done via singular value decompo-
sition (SVD). In order to reconstruct the concentra-
tions, one needs to consider the unspeciﬁed sign of the
vector V j
1 (when returned by the SVD routine), which
1 > 0 (the
has to be chosen such that
total amount of signal cannot be negative). The sig-
nal si, corresponding to the logarithms of the concen-
trations, is then computed by projecting the original
matrix onto the ﬁrst principal component V j

rected by a factor vmax which accounts for the fact
that the vector V j

. With this scheme, lower concentration
sorted
points were suppressed according to their rank, using
a slowly decaying Cauchy weight function. There are
many other ways to choose the weights, we simply
want to show a proof of principle here.

Note, the ﬁtting procedure used in the Li-Wong (Li
& Wong, 2001) method is identical to an SVD de-
composition, however, with diﬀerent input data than
was use here. The three main diﬀerence between our
method and the Li-Wong technique are: (i) in the
analysis here, we used log transformed PM and MM
intensities, rather than the bare PM-MM values; (ii)
we introduced optional weights, which can account
for non-linearities of the probe response in the high
concentration regime; (iii) we subtract the column
mean before we compute the principal components,
which is crucial for capturing the local directions of
variation. Indeed, as can be seen in Figure 2, the prin-
cipal component would be dominated by the mean
itself without subtraction.

Results

Data sets

The yeast Latin square (LS) experiment is a calibra-
tion data set produced by Aﬀymetrix, that uses a
non-commercial yeast chip. 14 groups of 8 diﬀer-
ent genes, all with diﬀerent probe sets, are spiked
onto 14 chips at concentrations, in pM, correspond-
ing to all cyclic permutations of the sequence (0, 0.25,
0.5, 1, 2, . . ., 1024). Hence, each group is probed
at 13 diﬀerent ﬁnite concentrations, logarithmically
spaced over a range of magnitudes from 1 to 4096
(in Figures 3 and 5, we refer to these concentrations
as (1 = 0.25 pM, 2 = 0.5 pM . . . 13 = 1024 pM),
and each group is completely absent in one array.
Besides the spiked-in target cRNA’s, a human RNA
background was added to mimic cross-hybridization
eﬀects that would occur in a real experiment. In ad-
dition, each experiment was hybridized twice leading
to 2 groups of 14 arrays called R1 and R2. This data
set was invaluable for initiating the analysis and in
allowing us to validate the results.

Summary of two-array methods

The ﬁgures in the results section show the log-ratios
as function of concentration in the form of boxplots.
In these plots, the central rectangle indicates the
median, 1st and 3rd quartiles (Q1 and Q3). The
“whiskers” extend on either side up to the last point
that is not considered an outlier. Outliers are explic-
itly drawn and are deﬁned as laying outside the inter-

is the interquartile distance. For each method, we
show three plots, the top two measure the false nega-
tive rate for ratios of 2 and 4 fold respectively, and the
last one shows the false positive rate. For the top two
plots, all combinations (within R1 and R2 separately)
of arrays leading to ratios of 2 and 4 were considered,
and plotted as function of their baseline intensity (the
lesser of the two concentrations). For the third, each
gene was compared between the groups R1 and R2,
at identical concentrations. Of the 8
14 = 112 tran-
scripts, 8 were left out of the analysis because they
did not lead to a signal that was tracking the con-
centrations at all (presumably due to bad probes or
transcript quality).

In Figures 3, we summarize the results obtained
by the Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0) soft-
ware and the “2 chips” method discussed in (Naef
et al., 2002). The later method computes for each
gene probed in two arrays a ratio score R such that

is a robust geometric mean (a least trimmed squares
estimator) of the probe ratios Rj. Figure 3 shows the
cases where

In both cases, only probes with numerator and de-

case (PM
MM ) is in essence similar to the MAS
5.0 program, diﬀerences are in the choice of the ro-
bust estimator and in the treatment of negative dif-
ferences. For our purpose here, we like to think of
the new Aﬀymetrix method as two-array, PM
MM
based method. In all the results presented below, the
arrays were scaled according to the MAS 5.0 default
settings.

The main features of Figure 3 are: there is an op-

timal range of baseline concentrations (
MM meth-
in which the ratio values from both PM
ods (the two ﬁrst columns) are fairly accurate, for
both ratios of 2 and 4. For both lower and higher
concentrations, there is a noticeable compression ef-
fect, which is most dramatic at the high end. At the
highest baseline concentration (512 pM for the ra-
tios of 2 and 256 pM for ratios of 4), changes of 2
are basically not detected and real changes of 4 are

4

−

compressed on average to values around 1.25. The
analysis of the false positive rate (last row) shows
that both methods yield very tight reproducibility:
the log2 ratio distributions are well centered around
0 and the interquartile distances are roughly inten-
sity independent and smaller than 0.2, meaning that
50% of the measurements fall in the ratio interval
[0.93, 1.07]. To be fair, we should point out that as a
MM ) method, the MAS 5.0 algorithm is on
(PM
average a bit cleaner, having slightly fewer outliers.
However, we like to emphasize that the qualitative be-
havior in the two (PM
MM ) methods is unchanged,
especially as far as the high-intensity compression is
concerned. Further, similar behavior is also found
using the (PM
MM ) Li-Wong method (data not
shown). The above observations are consistent with
what was reported recently in (Chudin et al., 2001),
conﬁrming that these eﬀects are independent of the
chip series. In fact, we also have evidence from a simi-
larly designed experiment with human chips that the
compression eﬀects are very similar and not better
behaved (not shown).

The third column in Figure 3 illustrates our con-
tention that the MM are in essence a set of lower
aﬃnity probes. We notice that using only the MM
measurements in the two-array method changes the
picture qualitatively. Whereas the low concentration
regime is far worse than in the (PM
MM ) meth-
ods, the behavior toward the high end has changed
and the drop oﬀ occurs now at higher concentrations:
approximately 256 pM for the ratios of 2 and 128 pM
for ratios of 4. On the other hand, even in the optimal
range, the magnitude of the medians are always a bit
lower than the real ratios, and the false positive rate
also suﬀers. To summarize, this result suggests that
if one is interested in accuracy at high concentrations,
then the MM-only methods oﬀers the best two-array
alternative. We have tried other variations: PM only,
or the double size set consisting in the merged PM
and MM’s, both being worse at high concentrations
than the MM only method.

Although ratio score may suﬀer severe compres-
sion, there remains the possibility that they would
be attributed a signiﬁcant increase or decrease call.
Figure 4 displays the relation between the MAS 5.0
log-ratios and their associated p-values. MAS 5.0
change ‘p-values’ pM are symmetric about 0.5 and
designed such that the ratio score is called increased
when pM < γ1 and decreased (D) when pM > 1
γ1,
with a default γ1 = 0.0025. This deﬁnition is not well
suited for plotting purposes, we therefore work with
pMAS = pM when pM < 0.5, and pMAS = 1
pM oth-
erwise. This way, both I and D genes have pMAS <

γ1, the direction being given by the sign of the log-
ratio. The results show that there remarkably few
false positive calls: only 4 out of 624 for concentra-
tions c
16 pM. Fold
changes of 4 are also well detected despite the com-
pression at high intensities: there are 21 false neg-
atives (and 3 false positives having ratios with the
wrong sign) out of 1248 for c
8 pM, and 84 of 1040
16 pM. The situation deteri-
false negatives for c

win in the end. Therefore, the real bottleneck cur-
rently resides in the technology itself, and also in our
limited understanding of the physical chemistry gov-
erning oligonucleotide hybridizations, as discussed in
detail in (Naef et al., 2002). Advances in this area,
as can be expected after the release of the probe se-
quences by Aﬀymetrix will greatly aide both the de-
sign and data analysis steps. As far as design issues
are concerned, probe selection is likely to be a cru-
cial aspect. Nevertheless, meeting the desired lin-
earity over, say 4 decades in concentration, together
with the constraint on high speciﬁcity of short length
probes will certainly be a diﬃcult challenge.

Multi-array methods

The data analyzed using our new method is shown in
Figure 5. It is clear that both are capable of reducing
the high intensity compression, as compared to exist-
ing methods. The second column explicitly shows
what can be gained from the local embedding.
It
should be noted, however, that the false positive rate
is signiﬁcantly larger than with the MAS 5, which is
not surprising as this technique is designed to maxi-
mize the signal detection. As compared to the “two
chip” MM method, which was previously the least
compressive in this regime, the medians are system-
atically more accurate.

Discussion

There are two orthogonal ways to utilize and think
about microarray experiments. In the ﬁrst case, one
may wish to minimize the false positive rate, and
we’ve shown that the new MAS 5.0 algorithm is does
remarkably well in that respect. On the other hand,
using microarrays as a gene discovery tool is perhaps
their most attractive feature. In that sense, it is de-
sirable to have methods aimed at maximizing sensi-
tivity, at the expense of a larger false positive rate.
It is expected in this case that microarray studies
would be independently veriﬁed to control for the in-
crease in false positives. Additionally, we often hear
from scientists that wildly diﬀerent conditions, like
severe pharmaceutical treatments or gene knockouts,
appear to have no detectable transcriptional eﬀects.
While there is indeed the possibility that transcrip-
tion regulatory networks can compensate for such
changes, or that some eﬀects would be mostly post-
transcriptional, real transcriptional changes may also
be masked by compressive eﬀects like those discussed
above.

As we have shown, ﬁner methods oﬀer the poten-
tial to recover some of the lost signal, however, strong
enough non-linearities and compression will always

Conclusions

We have summarized in detail the performance of ex-
isting methods for analyzing Aﬀymetrix GeneChip
data, using the yeast calibration dataset we were for-
tunate to obtain from Aﬀymetrix. The results show
unambiguously the compressive tendency of conven-
tional methods in the high-intensity range, namely
that fold changes as large as 4 in expression levels
can be reduced to fold changes barely larger than 1
(Figure 3). Additionally, we have proposed a new
method that enables one to extract more signal at
high concentrations. One caveat at this point is
that while achieving better accuracy at high inten-
sities, our method presented here performs worse
than traditional methods at low-intensities. In that
regime, it seems that the best results are obtained
from the usual PM
MM scheme. This indicates
that GeneChip data is suﬃciently complex enough
that for optimal performance, radically diﬀerent ap-
proaches may have to be used in the low and high
intensity ranges. It is plausible, however, that there
may be a technique that optimally interpolates be-
tween the two regimes.

[Q1 − 1.5 ∗ IQ, Q3 + 1.5 ∗ IQ], where IQ = Q3 − Q1 is the interquartile distance. Notice the two ﬁrst rows are
qualitatively similar, with the MAS 5.0 being marginally cleaner. Both methods show a strong high concentration
compression, but have excellent reproducibility (cf. text). The third column illustrates that MM probes contain
valuable signal, often leading to more accurate ratios at high concentrations.

log-ratios in for MAS 5.0. The plotted pM AS is the transformed MAS 5.0 p-value (cf.
text). The dotted line indicates the default γ1 = 0.0025, below which MAS 5.0 scores are considered increased (I) or
decreased (D) (for the transformed p-value). Colors are used to group baseline intensities of 0.25–1 pM (black), 2–8
pM (red), 16–64 pM (green), 128–1024 (blue).

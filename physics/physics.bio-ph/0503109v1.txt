Elastic lever arm model for myosin V

Andrej Vilfan
J. Stefan Institute, Jamova 39, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia∗

(Dated: March 11, 2005)

We present a mechanochemical model for myosin V, a two-headed processive motor protein. We
derive the properties of a dimer from those of an individual head, which we model both with
a 4-state cycle (detached, attached with ADP.Pi, attached with ADP and attached without nu-
cleotide) and alternatively with a 5-state cycle (where the power stroke is not tightly coupled
to the phosphate release). In each state the lever arm leaves the head at a diﬀerent, but ﬁxed,
angle. The lever arm itself is described as an elastic rod. The chemical cycles of both heads are
coordinated exclusively by the mechanical connection between the two lever arms. The model
explains head coordination by showing that the lead head only binds to actin after the power
stroke in the trail head and that it only undergoes its power stroke after the trail head unbinds
from actin. Both models (4- and 5-state) reproduce the observed hand-over-hand motion and
ﬁt the measured force-velocity relations. The main diﬀerence between the two models concerns
the load dependence of the run length, which is much weaker in the 5-state model. We show
how systematic processivity measurement under varying conditions could be used to distinguish
between both models and to determine the kinetic parameters.

Introduction

Myosin V is a motor protein involved in diﬀerent forms
intracellular transport (Reck-Peterson et al., 2000;
of
Vale, 2003). Because it was the ﬁrst discovered processive
motor from the myosin superfamily and due to its unique
features, including a very long step size, it has drawn a lot
of attention in recent years and now belongs to the best
studied motor proteins. The experiments have character-
ized it mechanically (Mehta et al., 1999; Purcell et al.,
2002; Rief et al., 2000; Rock et al., 2000; Veigel et al.,
2002), biochemically (De La Cruz et al., 2000a, 1999,
2000b; Purcell et al., 2002; Yengo et al., 2002), optically
(Ali et al., 2002; Forkey et al., 2003; Yildiz et al., 2003)
and structurally (Burgess et al., 2002; Coureux et al.,
2003; Walker et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2003). These
studies have shown that myosin V walks along actin ﬁl-
aments in a hand-over-hand fashion (Yildiz et al., 2003)
with an average step size of about 35 nm, roughly corre-
sponding to the periodicity of actin ﬁlaments (Ali et al.,
2002; Mehta et al., 1999; Rief et al., 2000; Veigel et al.,
2002), a stall force of around 2 pN (Rief et al., 2000)
and a run length of a few microns (Baker et al., 2004;
Rief et al., 2000; Sakamoto et al., 2003). Under physi-
ological conditions, ADP release was shown to be the
time limiting step in the duty cycle (De La Cruz et al.,
1999; Rief et al., 2000). Two stages of the power stroke
have been resolved: one about 20nm, possibly connected
with the release of phosphate, and another one of 5nm,
probably occurring upon release of ADP (Veigel et al.,
2002). Despite all this progress, the deﬁnite answer to
the questions how the mechanical and the chemical cycle

are coupled and how the heads communicate with each
other to coordinate their activity has not yet been found.

Theoretical models

for processive molecular mo-
tors can follow diﬀerent goals. What most models
have in common is that they identify a few long-
living states in the mechanochemical cycle and as-
sume stochastic (Markovian) transitions between them.
The diﬀerences between models start in the way these
states are chosen. An approach that has been ap-
plied to myosin V (Kolomeisky and Fisher, 2003), ki-
nesin (Peskin and Oster, 1995; Schief and Howard, 2001;
Thomas et al., 2002), as well as to other biological
mechanisms of force generation,
including actin poly-
merization (Peskin et al., 1993) and RNA polymerase
(Wang et al., 1998), models the motors as stochastic
steppers. These models describe the whole motor as an
object that can go through a certain number of confor-
mations (typically a few) with diﬀerent positions along
the track. After the completion of one cycle (which is,
in models for myosin V and kinesin, tightly coupled to
the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule), the motor advances
by one step. All steps are reversible and at loads above
the stall the motor is supposed to walk backwards and
thereby regenerate ATP. The approach has been partic-
ularly useful for interpreting the measured force-velocity
relations and relating them to the kinetic parameters
and positions of substeps (Fisher and Kolomeisky, 2001;
Kolomeisky and Fisher, 2003; Schief and Howard, 2001).
A limitation of such models is that they assume coordi-
nated activity of both heads rather than explaining it.
They also assume that the motor strictly follows the reg-
ular cycle and there is no place for events like steps of
variable length and dissociation from the track, although
the latter can be incorporated into the models by propos-
ing a diﬀerent dissociation rate for each state in the cycle.

In this Article we present a physical model for the pro-
cessive motility of myosin V. The basic building block of

our model is an individual head, which we model in a sim-
ilar way as the models for conventional myosins do (Hill,
1974), albeit with diﬀerent rate constants. The head is
connected to the lever arm, which we model as an elastic
rod, whose geometry we infer from electron microscopy
studies (Burgess et al., 2002; Walker et al., 2000). The
two lever arms are connected through a ﬂexible joint and
this is the exclusive way of communication between them.
We will derive the properties of the dimer from those of
the individual head.

The Model

To describe each myosin V head we use a model based
on the 4-state cycle as postulated by Lymn and Taylor
(1971) and used in many quantitative muscle models
(Hill, 1974) (Fig. 2A). We restrict ourselves to the long-
living states in the cycle: detached with ADP.Pi, bound
with ADP.Pi, bound with ADP, detached with ADP and
bound without a nucleotide. The bound state with ATP
and the free state with ATP have both been found to be
very short-lived (De La Cruz et al., 1999) and we there-
fore omit them in our description, i.e., we assume that
binding of ATP to a bound head leads to immediate de-
tachment and ATP hydrolysis. The detached state with-
out a nucleotide is very unlikely to be occupied because
of the low transition rates leading to it and we omit it
from our scheme as well.

One question that has not yet been deﬁnitely answered,
is whether Pi release occurs before or during the power
stroke, i.e., whether a head which is mechanically re-
strained form conducting its power stroke can release Pi
or not. The 4-state model assumes a tight linkage be-
tween the Pi release and the power stroke. While the
4-state model has been successfully applied to myosin II
(e.g., Duke (1999); Vilfan and Duke (2003)), recent ex-
perimental evidence suggests that the lead head can re-
lease Pi before the power stroke (Rosenfeld and Sweeney,
2004). We therefore also discuss an alternative 5-state
model.
In the 5-state model we introduce an addi-
tional state ADP′ in which the phosphate is already re-
leased, but the lever-arm is still in the pre-powerstroke
state. The next transition, ADP release, however, is still
linked to the completion of the full power-stroke. This
is necessary in order to explain head coordination and
also in agreement with experiments that show a strain-
dependence in the ADP release rate in single-headed
molecules (Veigel et al., 2002). The extended duty cy-
cle of a head is shown in Fig. 2B.

A head always binds to an actin subunit in the same
relative position. In each state, the proximal end of the
lever arm leaves the head in a ﬁxed direction in space,
determined by the polar angle φ towards the ﬁlament
plus end and the azimuthal angle θ = θ0i of the actin
subunit i to which the head is bound. The geometry of
the molecule and the angles were inferred from images
obtained with electron microscopy (Burgess et al., 2002;

FIG. 1 The myosin V dimer is modeled as two heads, each
connected to a lever arm which leaves the head at a certain
angle φ, depending on the state of the head. The two lever
arms, modeled as elastic beams, are connected with a ﬂexible
joint, which is also connected to the external load.

FIG. 2 A) The mechanochemical cycle of each individual
head. The head attaches to actin in the state with ADP and
Pi bound on it, undergoes a large conformational change upon
Pi release, another smaller conformational change upon ADP
release, then binds ATP and enters the very weakly bound
state, which dissociates quickly. B) The mechanochemical
cycle in the 5-state model.
In this scenario, the phosphate
release and the power stroke are two separate transitions.

In our calculations we assume a 13/6 periodicity of the
actin helix (6 rotations per 13 subunits), which means
θ0 = 2π × 6/13.

We assume that the lever arm has the properties of a
linear, uniform and isotropic elastic rod, described with
the bending modulus EI. Then the local curvature κ is
determined from M = EIκ, where M is the local bend-
ing moment (torque). The lever arms from both heads
are joined together (and to the tail) with a ﬂexible joint
which allows free rotation in all directions. For a certain
conﬁguration of chemical states, binding sites of both
heads and a given external force, the three-dimensional
shape and the bending energy of both lever arms can
be calculated numerically as described in the Appendix.
Some of the calculated shapes are shown in Fig. 3.
We calculate the free energy of a dimer state as

G = G1 + G2 + U1 + U2 + F x ,

(1)

where G1 and G2 are the intrinsic free energies of both
heads (which depend on the chemical state of the head
and the concentrations of nucleotides), U1 and U2 are the
energies stored in the elastic deformation of each lever
arm, and F x is the work done against the external load
(x denotes the coordinate of the ﬂexible joint along the
ﬁlament axis with positive values towards the plus end,
while positive values of F denote a force pulling towards
the minus end, against the direction of motion of an un-
loaded motor).

Transition rates

There are two exact statements we can make about
the kinetic rates of the duty cycle that follow from the
principle of detailed balance. The ﬁrst statement relates
the forward and the backward rate of any reaction to the
free energy diﬀerence between the initial and the ﬁnal
state. For any transition the principle of detailed balance
states that

where ∆U denotes the change in elastic energy of the
dimer and F ∆x the work performed against the external
load.

The second exact statement can be derived by mul-
tiplying together the detailed balance conditions for a
monomer in the absence of any external force along a
closed pathway in Fig. 2. After one cycle the free en-
ergy of the bound monomeric head returns to its initial
value, while the total free energy change in the system
equals the amount gained from the hydrolysis of one ATP
molecule. The resulting relation reads

A similar statement also holds for the rates along the
inner loop in the reaction scheme, which involves attach-
ment, power stroke and detachment, all in the ADP state.
Because we assume that the detachment rate in the pre-
powerstroke and the post-powerstroke state are both the
same (k′

When it comes to the actual force dependence of tran-
sition rates we have to rely on approximations. An ap-
proach that is most widely used when modeling motor
proteins, but also other conformational changes, like the
gating of ion channels, involves the Arrhenius theory of
reaction rates (Hill, 1974).
It proposes that the pro-
tein has to reach an activation point (xa) somewhere be-
tween the initial (xi) and the ﬁnal state (xf ) by thermal
diﬀusion, but completes the reaction rapidly after that.
Therefore, the force dependence of the forward rate can
be modeled as

k+i = k0

+ie

− U (xa)−U (xi )
kB T

k−i = k0

−ie

− U (xa)−U (xf )
kB T

(6)

where U (x) means the total potential (bending of both
lever-arms and work done against the external
load)
which a head has to overcome to bring the lever arm
angle into a given state. We use the variable ǫ to denote
the relative position of the activation point between the
initial and the ﬁnal state, so that xa = (1 − ǫ)xi + ǫxf .
Unless otherwise noted, we will assume ǫ = 0.5. Not

pre-powerstroke state (bottom row). Each conﬁguration is shown in side and front view. If both heads are in the same state
(bottom two rows) there is a signiﬁcant cost in elastic energy needed to buckle one of the lever arms. Binding of the lead head
before the trail head undergoes the power stroke is therefore unlikely.

precisely identical, but useful for practical purposes is
also the approximation U (xa) = (1 − ǫ)U (xi) + ǫU (xf ).
Therefore we get the following expression for the force-
dependence of the transition rate:

For reactions that involve the binding and unbinding
of a head, Eq. 2 is valid, but one expects the activa-
tion point to be much closer to the bound state. The
strain-dependence of the detachment rate for heads in the
ADP and ATP.Pi state has not yet been measured and
we therefore neglect it, assuming that the detachment
rate is force-independent, k−A ≡ k0
−A. The attachment
rate then relates to the potential diﬀerence as

Results

Choice of the value for the bending modulus

There are two ways to estimate the bending stiﬀness of
the myosin V lever arm - one from its structure and anal-
ogy with similar molecules and the other one from the ob-
served behavior of the dimeric molecule. The lever arm
consists of 6 IQ motifs, forming an α-helix, surrounded
by 6 calmodulin or other light chains (Terrak et al., 2003;
Wang et al., 2003). One possible estimate for the stiﬀ-

ness of the lever arm can be obtained by approximat-
ing it with a coiled-coil domain, as has been done by
Howard and Spudich (1996). Generally, the stiﬀness of a
semiﬂexible molecule is related to its persistence length ℓp
as EI = ℓpkBT . Howard and Spudich estimated the per-
sistence length of a coiled-coil domain as 100 nm, which
yields EI ≈ 400 pN nm2. Other researchers report val-
ues of ℓp = 130 nm for myosin (Hvidt et al., 1982) and
ℓp = 150 nm for tropomyosin (Phillips and Chacko, 1996;
Swenson and Stellwagen, 1989).

On the other hand, we can estimate the stiﬀness from
the force a lever arm has to bear under conditions close
to stall. We do this by calculating the distribution of
binding probabilities to diﬀerent sites at F = 1.8 pN,
which is close to stall force. We assume that the binding
rate to each site is proportional to its Boltzmann weight,
exp(−G/kBT ), which is equivalent to assuming that the
activation point of the binding process is close to the ﬁnal
state and that the reverse reaction (detachment in the
state with ADP.Pi) has no force-dependence in its rate.
The expectation value of the binding position of the lead
head relative to the trail head is shown in Fig. 4. It shows
that a stiﬀness of EI & 1000 pN nm2 is necessary to allow
stepping at loads of this magnitude.

For these reasons, we use the value EI = 1500 pN nm2.
This corresponds to an elastic constant (measured at the
joint) of

k = 3EI/L3 = 0.25 pN/nm .

FIG. 4 The average step size under a load of F = 1.8 pN
as a function of the lever arm elasticity EI. The step size
was calculated from attachment probabilities of the lead head
(ADP.Pi state) relative to the bound trail head (ADP state).

The elastic constant for longitudinal forces (with respect
to the lever arm) is much higher.
If we approximate
the lever arm with a homogeneous cylinder of radius
r = 1 nm, we can estimate it as kL = 4EI/(r2L) =
230 pN/nm. We therefore neglect the longitudinal exten-
sibility of the lever arm in all calculations.

A similar value (EI = 1300 pN nm2) has also been ob-

tained by analyzing data from optical trap experiments
on single-headed myosin V molecules with diﬀerent lever
arm lengths (Moore et al., 2004). Even though it is some-
what larger (about 3 times) than the values estimated for
myosin II (Howard and Spudich, 1996), there is no solid
evidence that the structures with diﬀerent light chains
have the same bending stiﬀness. On the other hand,
there could have been some evolutionary pressure to in-
crease the lever arm stiﬀness, as it is directly related to
the stall force of myosin V. While we are not able to give
a deﬁnite answer to the question whether the lever arm
behaves like a uniform elastic rod or whether there is a
pliant region close to the head, we favor the ﬁrst hypoth-
esis because the estimated lever arm elasticity already is
more than suﬃcient to explain the mechanical properties
of the dimeric molecule.

Step size distribution

Figure 3 shows the energies stored in the elastic dis-
tortions of the lever arms of both heads in the pre-
powerstroke or the post-powerstroke state. For example,
if the ﬁrst head is in the ADP.Pi state and the second
head binds before the ﬁrst one undergoes a power stroke,
this is connected with an energy cost of 6.6 kBT . The
attachment rate of the lead head before the power stroke
in the trail head is therefore more than 100 times slower
than after the power stroke.

Because the lead head normally attaches to actin while
the trail head is in the ADP state, we can determine the
probability that the lead head binds to an actin site i
subunits in front of the trail head from the Boltzmann
factors formed from the bending energy in the ﬁnal con-
ﬁguration, Pi ∝ exp(−(U1 + U2)/kBT ). Here U1 + U2
denotes the sum of elastic energies stored in both lever
arms if the trail head is in the ADP state and the lead
head in the ADP.Pi state, bound i sites in front of the
trail head. The resulting distributions for diﬀerent lever
arm lengths are shown in Fig. 5. For the lever arm con-
sisting of 6 IQ motifs, the result is a mixture of 11 and 13
subunit steps, whereby 13 subunits dominate. Azimuthal
distortion plays a major role in the bending energy, there-
fore binding is only likely to sites 2, 11, 13 and 15, on
which the azimuthal angles of both heads diﬀer by not
more than 27◦.

The gated step in the cycle

A question that has been a subject of intense discussion
is which step in the cycle is deciding for the coordination
of the two heads. A currently often favored hypothesis
proposes that the lead head undergoes its power stroke
immediately after binding, thereby storing energy into
elastic deformation of its lever arm and releasing it after
the unbinding of the trail head. An alternative hypothe-
sis proposes that the release of the rear head is necessary

head in the post-powerstroke ADP state. The probabilities
were determined from the Boltzmann factors, resulting from
the elastic distortion energy of the conﬁguration. Azimuthal
distortion plays a crucial role role in determining the step size,
which is the reason why the binding is always concentrated on
sites 2, 11, 13 and 15. Taking into account the ﬂuctuations
in the actin would lead to a broader distribution, in better
agreement with experiments (Walker et al., 2000).

below, our model favors this picture. In the 4-state sce-
nario, this implies that the lead head is waiting in the
ADP.Pi. In the 5-state scenario it is in the ADP′ state
(the pre-powerstroke ADP state). The trail head spends
most of its cycle in the ADP state in both scenarios at
saturating ADP concentrations.

Because this model challenges the currently prevail-
ing view, we should ﬁrst critically review the arguments
supporting it. One argument includes the direct observa-
tion of telemark-shaped molecules, with the leading head
leaning forward and then the lever arm tilted strongly
backwards (Walker et al., 2000). A more detailed image
analysis, however, showed that the converter of the lead-
ing head is in the pre-powerstroke state (Burgess et al.,
2002). Another piece of evidence comes from experiments
by Forkey et al. (2003) which show a fraction of tags on
the lever arm (30-50%) that do not tilt while moving,
but again the data provide no conclusive proof because
the method does not allow detection of tilts symmetric
with respect to the vertical axis. To conclude, one cannot
say that the present experimental evidence excludes any
of the two hypotheses about the moment of phosphate
release and of the power stroke.

From the theoretical side, we will argue that in a
model with linear elasticity the mechanism with imme-
diate power stroke in the lead head cannot work under
loads for which the motor is known to be operational.
It is known that the monomeric constructs of myosin V
undergo a normal duty cycle (De La Cruz et al., 1999;

Yengo et al., 2002), which means that no step in the cycle
requires mechanical work from the outside for its comple-
tion (which would be, for example, the case if the head
needed to be pulled away from actin to complete the cy-
cle). This excludes the possibility that the free energy
gain connected with binding and the power stroke ex-
ceeds ∆GATP = 100 pNnm, the total available energy
for one cycle. Because this and other transitions in the
cycle need to be forward-running, we use the still con-
servative estimate that the free energy gain from binding
and the power stroke cannot exceed 80 pNnm. On the
other hand, we can estimate the free energy that would
be necessary for a head to bind to a site 13 units ahead
and then undergo a conformational change. The amount
of energy needed to bring the dimer into the hypothetical
state with both heads in the post-powerstroke state and
a strong distortion, especially of the leading lever arm, is
plotted in Fig. 6. The calculation shows that the bind-
ing of the front head with the subsequent power stroke
before the rear head detaches (for a load of F = 1.8 pN)
is only possible for values of EI . 450 pN nm2, which
is inconsistent with the lower estimate based on the ob-
served step size (Fig. 4). Of course, we cannot rule out
that there is some additional state in the middle of the
power stroke which is occupied immediately while the
lead head waits for the trail head to detach. But within
the scope of the geometrical model with a single power
stroke connected with the Pi release, we consider the sce-
nario where the lead head instantaneously undergoes the
power stroke without waiting for the detachment of the
trail head unrealistic.

Hidden power strokes in the dimer conﬁguration

An immediate consequence of the elastic lever arm
model is that the tail position is mainly determined by
the geometry of the triangle and less by the conforma-
tions of individual heads. For a monomeric head or a
dimer bound by a single head, the power-stroke upon
ADP release has an x-component (in the direction of the
actin ﬁlament) of about 3.3 nm (Fig. 7). If the lead head
is attached, however, the power stroke as measured on
the tail is reduced by about a factor of 50. The tail
movement is also closely related to the force-dependence
of transition rates, which means that transitions between
states with both heads bound do not show any signiﬁcant
load dependence. In the kinetic scheme we use here this
implies that the rates of ADP release and ATP binding
(the two rate limiting steps at low or forward loads) are
both constant, in agreement with the ﬂat F-v curve mea-
sured by Mehta et al. (1999).

is
F = 1.8 pN. The lower curve shows the energy needed to
pull the external load and distort the lever arms in order to
bind the new lead head 13 sites in front of the trailing head.
Note that most of this work will be performed by Brownian
motion, but the potential well in the bound state still has
to be strong enough to stabilize the bound state. The middle
curve shows the energy needed mainly for the distortion of the
lever arms when the lead head undergoes a power-stroke be-
fore the trailing head detaches. Since the sum of both cannot
be higher than 80 pN nm, we estimate that this hypothetical
scenario would only be possible if the lever arm stiﬀness was
EI . 450 pN nm2. This is inconsistent with other require-
ments of the model, so we rule this scenario out.

stroke upon ADP release equals 3.3nm (for zero load).
In
the dimer with both heads bound, only 0.07nm of that power

of transition rates between states with both heads bound is
negligible.

locity of a dimeric motor and its dissociation rate from
actin. The most probable kinetic pathway of the dimer
is indicated by thick arrows in Fig. 8, while the thin ar-
rows indicate some of the possible side branches that can
lead to dissociation. Figure 9 shows the resulting force-
velocity curves and Fig. 11 the dissociation rates.

An analytical solution of the 4-state model would, in
theory, require solving the occupation probabilities for a
system with about 6 + 8 × 3 × 3 = 78 states (6 states with
one head bound, plus conﬁgurations with both heads
bound, where each head can occupy 3 diﬀerent states and

the relative positions of both heads can have 8 diﬀerent
values). Such a system could easily be solved numeri-
cally, but would be too complex for obtaining an insight-
ful analytical expression. However, we will show that a
simpliﬁed pathway can already lead to expressions that
agree reasonably well with simulation data and are there-
fore useful for ﬁtting model parameters to experimental
data.

In the following, we give approximate expressions for
the most signiﬁcant steps in the mechanochemical cycle.

The results for two diﬀerent ATP concentrations are

the result of alternative pathways, neglected force-
dependence of the ADP release rate and variation in the
step size. The experimentally measured force-velocity
curves (Mehta et al., 1999; Uemura et al., 2004) are
also well reproduced, although the experiments show
a more abrupt drop in velocity at high loads, with no
measurable eﬀect up to about 1pN.

In the 5-state model the power-stroke can be fast
and reversible,
in which case the pre- and the post-
powerstroke state can reach an equilibrium and the lim-
iting rate is proportional to the probability of the post-
powerstroke state 1/(1 + exp(F dPS/kBT )) - a signiﬁ-
cantly sharper load dependence than the 4-state model

(Fig. 10).

Inhibition by ADP and phosphate

It is a well established observation that ADP can slow
down myosin V by binding to heads in the state with no
nucleotide and thereby preventing them from accepting
an ATP molecule. The rate of ADP rebinding is already
taken into account in the kinetic constants and the model
naturally reproduces the observed behavior, as shown in

Figs. 9 and 12 for the 4-state model and in Fig. 10 for
the 5-state model. Not yet experimentally investigated
has been the inhibition by phosphate. Its intensity de-
pends on the reverse power-stroke rate, which is one of
the open parameters of our model. In the 4-state model,
Pi re-binding is necessary for the reverse power stroke
and therefore some inhibition eﬀect can be expected at
high loads. The simulation shows clearly that the phos-
phate concentration has no eﬀect on zero-load velocity,
but it does slow down the motor close to stall (Fig. 9B).
A similar eﬀect of Pi on isometric force has also been ob-
served in muscle (Cooke and Pate, 1985). In the 5-state
model Pi rebinding is not mechanically sensitive and its
eﬀect is roughly force-independent. However, with the
parameters chosen here, it is negligible.

Three dissociation pathways

As we can see from the kinetic scheme (Fig. 8), there
are three signiﬁcant pathways in the cycle that can lead
to the dissociation of the myosin V dimer from an actin
ﬁlament. The ﬁrst pathway leaves the cycle if a dimer
bound with one head in the ADP.Pi state detaches be-
fore the second head can attach. The second pathway
runs through a state in which the bound head releases
ADP and binds a new ATP molecule before the free
head can bind. With the third pathway we denote all
processes that involve the detachment of a head in the
ADP state. This is the pathway favored by recent results
of Baker et al. (2004). Figure 11 shows the dissociation
rate, separated by contributions of the three pathways.
They have the following characteristics:

Pathway 1: With this pathway we denote the dissocia-
tion of a head in the ADP.Pi state. Because this state is
long-lived at high loads in the 4-state, but short-lived in
the 5-state model, the resulting force-dependence of the

dissociation rate diﬀers signiﬁcantly in both scenarios.
In the 4-state model, the contribution to the dissociation
probability per step shows a strong load-dependence, but
no signiﬁcant dependence on the ATP concentration. It
can be estimated as

with dPS = L(cos φADP − cos φADP.Pi) + δ. The dissocia-
tion rate is higher for positive loads. From the estimated
run length at 1 pN load and saturating ATP concentra-
tion of about 15 steps (Clemen et al., 2003), we can es-
timate the unbinding rate as k−A ≈ 1 s−1. In order to
account for reported run lengths of over 50 steps at low
loads, we tentatively assign k0

+A ≈ 5000 s−1.

In the 5-state model, the situation is reversed. There
the dissociation process on path 1 takes place if the trail
head releases ADP before the lead head releases Pi, which
can happen in two diﬀerent ways: on one the rate is
approximately force-independent, on the other it grows
with negative (forward) loads. In order to obtain a signif-
icant contribution to the detachment rate on this path-
way, we choose a higher detachment rate k−A than in the
4-state model (50 s−1 instead of 1 s−1).

Pathway 2: Because the process of unbinding requires
an ATP molecule, the per-step dissociation rate grows
with the ATP concentration. In addition, it is propor-
tional to the ratio of the ADP dissociation rate and the
actin binding rate, k−ADP/k+A, which is higher for neg-
ative (forward) loads. This holds in both the 4- and the
5-state scenario.

Pathway 3: The dissociation probability on pathway 3
is proportional to the detachment rate in the ADP state,
k′
−A. Of all three pathways, this one shows the weakest
load-dependence, although it is higher for forward loads.
We expect that systematic data on mean run length as
a function of load and nucleotide concentrations will be
helpful to determine the remaining model parameters.

Reverse stepping in the 5-state model

As a consequence of both the reversibility of the power
stroke and the slower dissociation rate at high loads, the
motor can step backwards under loads exceeding the stall
force (Fig. 14). Note that these steps are not the sim-
ple reversal of forward steps (which would involve ATP
synthesis), but rather indicate a diﬀerent pathway in the
kinetic scheme, in which both heads stay in the ADP
state and alternately release actin at the leading position
and rebind at the trailing. The time scale of reverse step-
ping is determined by the dissociation rate of a head in
−A, which we chose as 0.1 s−1. With
the ADP state, k′
a higher value of k′
−A, especially for the pre-powerstroke
state (so far we assumed that the rate is equal in both
ADP states), faster stepping would also be possible, al-
though there is an upper limit on k′
−A, imposed by the
dissociation rate on pathway 3.

FIG. 14 Reverse stepping in the 5-state model under a high
load (4.5pN), 10 µM ATP and 1 µM ADP. There is also some
creeping motion between the steps, which results from the
attachment and detachment of the two heads on neighboring
sites, and only takes place if myosin V is allowed to follow
a helical path on actin. If binding is constrained to one side
of the actin ﬁlament (like on a coverslip), then only regular
reverse steps with the periodicity of the helix are observed
(not shown).

Discussion

We used the geometrical data of the myosin V molecule
as obtained from EM images to calculate the confor-
mations and elastic energies in all dimer conﬁgurations.
These data were ﬁrst used in a model with a four-state
cycle and subsequently in a ﬁve-state model.

The ﬁrst result, which follows directly from the bend-
ing potentials and is independent of the underlying cycle
is that the elastic lever arm model explains two key com-
ponents of the coordination between heads: why the lead
head does not bind to actin before the power stroke in

11

the trail head and why it does not undergo its power
stroke before the trail head detaches. It also allows us
to calculate the distribution of step sizes. The results for
diﬀerent lever-arm lengths (Fig. 5) give realistic values,
in agreement with step size and helicity measurements
(Ali et al., 2002; Purcell et al., 2002), even though they
have a slight tendency towards underestimation and also
show a narrower distribution than direct electron mi-
croscopy observations (Walker et al., 2000). A possible
explanation for the broader distribution than predicted
by the model lies in the fact that in reality the actin struc-
ture does not follow the perfect helix, as assumed in our
model, but has angular deviations of up to 10◦ per sub-
unit (Egelman et al., 1982). Taking these ﬂuctuations
into account would clearly broaden the distribution of
our step sizes, but alone it cannot explain the tendency
towards longer steps. The most straightforward expla-
nation for the longer steps is that the power stroke has
an additional right-handed azimuthal component. Then
the conﬁguration with the lowest energy is reached if the
lead head is twisted to the right relatively to the trail
head, which is the case if it is bound further away along
the helix. The observation that the actin repeat is often
somewhat longer than 13 subunits (some results suggest
a structure closer to a 28/13 helix (Egelman et al., 1982))
could also partially explain the deviation.

An issue that has been much discussed is the contri-
bution of Brownian motion and the power stroke to the
total step size. With the geometric data used in this
study, the power stroke, i.e., the distance of the lever
arm tip movement between the states ADP.Pi and ADP,
is about 31nm, or 5nm less than the average step size.
Note that the second, smaller power stroke connected
with ADP release does not contribute to the step size
because it is normally followed by the detachment of the
same head. Its function could be suppressing premature
dissociation before the lead head binds and thus improv-
ing the processivity. The remaining 5nm can be overcome
by Brownian motion before the lead head binds. How-
ever, at low loads, the binding of the lead head does not
move the load, but rather stores the energy into bent
lever arms. This energy gets released when the rear head
detaches, which leads to an elastic power stroke imme-
diately preceding the power stroke upon Pi release. At
higher loads the situation is diﬀerent, because the 5nm
load movement occurs when the lead head binds. In nei-
ther case we expect the 5nm power stroke to be resolvable
under normal conditions because it always immediately
precedes or follows the large power stroke. However, it
is possible that the substeps become observable in the
presence of chemicals that slow down the power stroke
(Uemura et al., 2004).

In order to fully reproduce the substeps as reported by
Uemura et al. (2004), some modiﬁcations would be nec-
essary to the model. First, part of the power-stroke would
have to occur immediately upon Pi release, resulting in a
lever arm move of about 12 nm (ﬁrst substep). This step
would need a very strong force-dependence in its transi-

tion rate (activation point near the ﬁnal state). The sub-
sequent longer power stroke (ADP’→ADP) would then
need a slower rate (∼ 200 s−1) with less force dependence
(activation point close to the initial state). However, the
ﬁnding that the substep position is independent of force
remains diﬃcult to explain, because the substep involves
transition between a stiﬀ conﬁguration, bound on both
heads, and a more compliant state, bound on a single
head.

The main value of both models (4- and 5-state) is that
they provide a quantitative explanation of the coordi-
nated head-over-head motility of the dimeric molecule
while using only the properties of a single head as in-
put. Both models also explain the observed force-velocity
curves at high and low ATP concentration and the ef-
fect of additional ADP, but these features already reveal
some testable diﬀerences between the two scenarios. One
of them is the shape of the force-velocity curve. In the
4-state scenario the reverse power-stroke needs the re-
binding of a phosphate molecule. This makes the cutoﬀ
behavior at high loads dependent on the Pi concentra-
tion: the velocity drop is more gradual at low, but might
become sharper at high Pi concentrations (Fig. 9B). In
the 5-state scenario the velocity decline is more abrupt
regardless of the Pi concentration. This is the ﬁrst sug-
gestion how experiments with improved precision and a
wider range of chemical conditions could help distinguish-
ing between the two scenarios.

The main diﬀerence between the two scenarios is the
predicted shape of the run length. Because the disso-
ciation can take place on three diﬀerent pathways, its
rate depends on a number of parameters, of which a few
cannot yet be determined by other methods. In the 4-
state model the dissociation rate at high loads is domi-
nated by detachment of a head in the ADP.Pi state and
it therefore depends on the ratio k0
−Pi (Eq. 14). A
strong increase with the load is characteristic for the 4-
state model, because the load slows down the phosphate
release and prolongs the dwell time in the state that is
most vulnerable to dissociation. Dissociation at negative
(forward) loads is dominated by pathways 2 (ATP medi-
ated actin release in one head before the other head has
bound) and 3 (dissociation of a head with ADP). In the
5-state model all three pathways can contribute towards
the dissociation rate, but there is no signiﬁcant increase
for positive loads - in fact, the dissociation rate can even
decrease.

−A/k0

The run length shortens with an increasing ADP con-
centration in both scenarios. The decrease in run length
is weaker than the decrease in the velocity (Fig. 12),
which is consistent with recent observations (Baker et al.,
2004). However, we cannot reproduce the reported com-
plete saturation of run length at hight ADP concentra-
tions. Baker et al. (2004) explain this saturation with a
big diﬀerence (50-fold) between the attachment rates of
the lead head depending whether the trail head is in the
ADP or apo state, which we currently cannot reproduce
with the relatively small power stroke (10◦) upon ADP

12

release in our model.

An interesting diﬀerence between the 4- and the 5-state
model is also that the 5-state model allows backward
steps at high loads (above the stall force), while the 4-
state model predicts rapid dissociation. In general, there
are three possibilities how backward steps can occur: (i)
(ii)
The motor hydrolyzes ATP, but runs backwards.
The motor slips backwards without hydrolyzing ATP —
this is the case in our model. (iii) The motor synthesizes
ATP from ADP and phosphate while being pulled back-
wards, as assumed by tightly coupled stochastic stepper
models (e.g., Kolomeisky and Fisher, 2003). It is possi-
ble to test these three possibilities experimentally: If (i)
is the case, the backward sliding velocity should show a
Michealis-Menten type dependence on ATP concentra-
tion. This mechanism would, however, require an even
looser mechanochemical coupling, so that not only the
release of Pi, but also the release of ADP and binding
of ATP would be possible without completing the power
stroke. In case (iii) it should depend on ADP as well as
on Pi concentration, but not on ATP. In case (ii), which
is favored by our study, the backward stepping occurs
when both heads have ADP bound on them and they
successively release actin at the lead position and rebind
it at the new trail position. Even though this stepping
requires no net reaction between the nucleotides, a cer-
tain (low) ADP concentration is still required to prevent
the heads from staying locked in the rigor (no nucleotide)
state.

The application of the elastic lever-arm approach de-
veloped here should not be limited to simple geome-
tries and longitudinal loads. A natural extension of the
present work will be the inﬂuence of perpendicular forces
on the activity of the motor. One will also be able to
study the stepping behavior in more complex geometries,
for example when passing a branching site induced by the
Arp2/3 complex (Machesky and Gould, 1999).

After completion of this manuscript,

it has been
brought to my attention that Lan and Sun (2005) have
also published a model for myosin V, based on the elas-
ticity of the lever arm. In contrast to our model, they
do not describe it as an isotropic rod, but use a weaker
in-plane stiﬀness, combined with a strong (phenomeno-
logical) azimuthal term that prevents binding of both
heads to adjacent sites on actin. Another diﬀerence is
that their study explicitly excludes dissociation events,
whereas we use the dissociation rate to determine some
of the model parameters.

Appendix

Numerical solution for the lever arm shape

The aim of this calculation is to determine the shape
of the dimeric molecule for a given set of binding sites
(trailing head bound on the site with the index i1, lead-
ing head with i2), nucleotide states, which determine the
lever arm starting angles φ1 and φ2, and a given external
load F .

We start this task by deriving a function that numer-
ically determines the endpoint of a lever arm as a func-
tion of the force acting on it: xj (Fj, φj ) (j = 1, 2). The
shape of the whole molecule can then be determined nu-
merically from the conditions that the endpoints of the
two lever arms coincide, x1 = x2, and from the force
equilibrium in that point

F1 + F2 = −F ˆex .

(15)

In many cases the function xj will have more than one
solution. Then we solve the system with all possible com-
binations and then choose the solution with the lowest
energy U = U1 + U2 + F x, where U1 and U2 denote the
energy stored in the distortion of each lever arm and F x
the work performed against the applied load.

For a head bound at site i, the position of the proximal

end of its lever arm in Cartesian coordinates reads

and its initial tangent

x0 = 



ia + δ
−R sin(θ)
R cos(θ)






ˆt0 = 



cos(φ)
− sin(φ) sin(θ)
sin(φ) cos(θ)






(16)

(17)

where φ is the lever arm tilt (a function of the nucleotide
state), δ is the relative position of the lever arm proximal
end (0 or 3.5 nm) and θ is the azimuthal angle of the
actin subunit to which the head is bound, θ = θ0i with
13 × 360◦ ≈ 166◦. The helix rise per subunit is
θ0 ≈ 6
a = 2.75 nm.

If the force F acts on a lever arm that leaves the head
in the direction ˆt0, the whole lever arm will be bent in a
plane spanned by the vectors ˆt0 and F. We can introduce
a new two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system in
this plane, so that

˜ˆt0 =

0
1 !

 

˜Fy = Fˆt0

˜F =

˜Fx =

˜Fx
˜Fy !
 
F − ˆt0(Fˆt0)

(18)

(19)

In this coordinate system the shape can be determined

FIG. 15 The shapes of an elastic beam anchored at one end
and pulled by a given force F on its other end. The dashed
line shows the unloaded beam. According to the sign of the
initial curvature and the ﬁnal angle φL the solutions can be
divided into 4 classes. The beam corresponds to the myosin
V lever arm, which is anchored in the head at one end and
connected to a ﬂexible joint at the other end. Note that the
bending shown is exaggerated in comparison with realistic
dimer conﬁgurations.

Here we introduced the force angle φF , so that ˜Fx =

(cid:19)

Because of the ambiguity of a quadratic equation,
Eq. 23 generally has two solutions for a given set of
values for φ(s), F , φL and φF . As we have deﬁned
the coordinate system in a way that ˜Fx ≥ 0, we have
0 ≤ φF ≤ π. We also restrict ourselves to solutions
with |φ(s)| < 2π, i.e., we do not consider any spiraling
solutions, because they always have a higher bending en-
ergy than the straighter solution with the same endpoint.

There are four classes of functions φ(s) that satisfy the
condition that the RHS of Eq. 23 be positive:

Note that for classes II and III the RHS of Eq. 24 is

a given L. Taking this into account, we obtain a total
of up to 6 solutions. A situation in which all cases are
represented is shown in Fig. 15.

(cid:19)(cid:19)

The conﬁguration of the dimer is determined by solving
Eq. 15 for all possible combinations of modes and taking
the one with the lowest potential. The numerical inte-
gration and solution were performed using NAG libraries
(Numerical Algorithms Group) and the 3-d graphical rep-
resentation of the calculated shapes was made with POV-
Ray (www.povray.org).

Abstract

This thesis presents the original results I have obtained during the three-
year doctoral period in the División de Matemáticas Aplicadas y Sistemas
Computacionales (DMASC) of the Instituto Potosino de Investigación Cientíﬁca
y Tecnológica (IPICYT), in San Luis Potosí, México. These results have been
obtained under supervision and collaboration of Dr. Haret C. Rosu in what refers
to the ﬁrst part of the thesis, and of Dr. Ricardo Femat for the second part.

The ﬁrst part deals with some types of factorization methods that we were able to
develop and that lead us to particular solutions of travelling kink type for reaction-
diffusion equations and also to more general nonlinear differential equations
of interest in biology and nonlinear physics. We also applied supersymmetric
approaches in the context of biological dynamics of microtubules and the related
transport properties associated to their domain walls.
In addition, a complex
supersymmetric extension of the classical harmonic oscillator by which we obtain
new oscillatory modes has been developed; results that could be extended to
physical optics and the physics of cavities. Moreover, an application to chemical
physics of diatomic molecules using supersymmetric and factorization procedures
is developed.

The second part contains a detailed study on the synchronization of the chaotic
dynamics of two Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, by means of the mathematical tools
belonging to the geometrical control theory. Despite using different parameters
for each of the two neurons our analysis shows that synchronization states are
achieved. The synchronization is attained by the feedback structure of the
interconnection (coupling). Numerical results for the obtained neuronal dynamical
states are displayed.

Resumen

Esta tesis presenta los resultados originales que he obtenido durante los tres
años de periodo doctoral en la División de Matemáticas Aplicadas y Sistemas
Computacionales (DMASC) del Instituto Potosino de Investigación Cientíﬁca y
Tecnológica (IPICYT), en San Luis Potosí, México. Estos resultados se han
obtenido bajo la supervisión y colaboración del Dr. Haret C. Rosu en lo referente
a la primera parte de tesis, y del Dr. Ricardo Femat para la segunda parte.

La primera parte trata con algunos métodos de factorización que fuimos capaces
de desarrollar y que nos condujeron a soluciones particulares del tipo kink viajeras
para ecuaciones de reacción-difusión y también para ecuaciones diferenciales no
lineales más generales de interés en biología y física no lineal. Se aplicaron
también técnicas de supersimetría en el contexto de dinámica biológica de
microtúbulos y las propiedades de transporte asociadas a sus paredes de dominio.
En adición, se desarrolló una extensión supersimétrica compleja del oscilador
armónico clásico por el cual obtuvimos nuevos modos de oscilación; resultados que
pueden extenderse a óptica física y la física de cavidades. Además, se desarrolló
una aplicación a la ﬁsico-química de moléculas diatómicas usando procedimientos
de supersimetría y de factorización.

La segunda parte contiene un estudio referente a sincronización de la dinámica
caótica de dos neuronas Hodgkin-Huxley, en donde se han aplicado los métodos
matemáticos pertenecientes a la teoría de control geométrico. Aunque se han
utilizado diferentes parámetros para cada una de las dos neuronas, nuestro estudio
muestra que se obtienen estados dinámicos de sincronización. La sincronización
se logra por la estructura de retroalimentación de la interconexión (acoplamiento).
Se muestran los resultados numéricos para los estados de dinámica neuronal
obtenidos.

Preface

Scientiﬁc research and technological progress are important characteristics of the
modern world. They represent fundamental activities that can help mankind to
understand and transform nature with the purpose of improving standards of life.
Almost three years have past since I started my doctoral degree activity with the
hope to contribute myself to the worldwide scientiﬁc knowledge. The lines of
research I chose were on the border between mathematics and biology because I
was convinced that the interdisciplinary activity is very rewarding and could give
me better perspectives.
The doctoral
thesis consists of four parts, of which the ﬁrst contains ﬁve
chapters and is devoted to factorization methods of differential equations and their
applications in biology and physics, whereas the second part is divided in two
chapters and deals with the synchronization phenomena as studied in neuronal
ensembles. The thesis ends up with a ﬁnal conclusion and the bibliography
presented in Parts III and IV, respectively.

The ﬁrst chapter is a general presentation of the factorization methods for linear
second order differential equations. Also, the organization for Part I of the thesis
is presented.

The second chapter contains an original result for performing factorizations of
second order differential equations with polynomial nonlinearities that has been
reported in a paper published in Physical Review E in 2005. At the same time the
novel procedure allows to obtain particular solutions of travelling kink type in a
very efﬁcient way.

The third chapter presents more applications of the method to more complicated
nonlinear differential equations. The results of this chapter are published in
Progress of Theoretical Physics in 2005.

In the fourth chapter, I included the results of a supersymmetric factorization model

v

in the context of microtubules that we published in Physics Letters A in 2003.

The ﬁfth chapter refers to the original results that have been published in Journal
of Physics A in December of 2004. A complex extension to the classical harmonic
oscillator based on a supersymmetric factorization procedure that has been applied
before in particle physics is introduced in this chapter. The application of the same
method to the case of Morse potential, a well-known exactly solvable problem
in quantum mechanics with many applications in the physics and chemistry of
diatomic molecules is also included here; these results are published in Revista
Mexicana de Física, 2005.

With the sixth chapter starts the second part of the thesis. Some remarks on the
kink type results obtained through factorization methods in the ﬁrst part for pulse
propagation along neuron axons, and the connection with the synchronization
dynamics of a minimal ensemble of two neurons, employing nonlinear control
theory are presented.

In the seventh chapter, we focus ﬁrst on synchronization phenomena from the
standpoint of their role and importance in natural and technical systems. The
concept of chaos and the presence of chaotic behavior in nature are also described.
Next, synchronization methods for the control of chaos and their applications in
biological systems are shortly reviewed. The problem of the synchronization of two
Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons is emphasized because of its possible implications
in the dynamical processes of the brain. A brief discussion of the widely known
HH mathematical model of the neuron is given. Also, in the Introduction section,
the organization of Chapters 7 and 8 belonging to Part II of the thesis is presented.

In the eighth chapter, numerical results for the synchronized dynamics of two
HH neurons are presented. The mathematical methods employed belong to the
theory of geometrical nonlinear control and are used with the goal of studying the
synchronization of two HH neurons that are unidirectionally coupled. These results
are published in Chaos, Solitons and Fractals in July 2005.

Factorization techniques for linear second order
differential equations

1.1 Introduction

Factorization methods are powerful yet simple algebraic procedures to ﬁnd
eigenspectra and eigenfunctions of differential operators that avoid "cumbersome
recourse to the ready-made equipment of the mathematical
transformations,
warehouse or expansion into power series", to cite from the very ﬁrst paragraph
of the 1940’s papers of Schrödinger [1]. At the present time, one can ﬁnd in
the literature very good informative review papers on the factorization topics
It is now well known that for second-order linear differential operators,
[2, 3].
the factorizations are equivalent to their Darboux isospectrality (or covariance) and
also they represent a simple form of intertwining [3]. In this introduction, we will
touch upon both these issues.
In the case of Sturm-Liouville operators, E. Schrödinger ﬁrst developed a
factorization method he called "that of adjoint ﬁrst order operators" in 1940-
1941 [1], during the period he lived in Dublin.
In his very ﬁrst paper on the
method, Schrödinger deals with four cases: the Planck (harmonic) oscillator, the
nonrelativistic hydrogen atom, the spherical harmonics in the three-dimensional
hypersphere, and the Kepler motion in the hypersphere.
For the quantum harmonic oscillator, he wrote the amplitude equation

(1.1)

x2y + ly = 0 ,

Operating on one of these equations with the second of the two ﬁrst order
differential operators which occur in it, one gets for the function which results
from y by applying that operator an equation of the other type, but with l + 2 or
l
. The mutual adjointness of the two ﬁrst order linear
operators maintains the quadratic integrability of the solutions and furthermore the
whole spectrum can be obtained by repeated application of the adjoint operator to
the l = 1 solutions of the partner operators, e.g.,

2, respectively, instead of l

whereas the even eigenfunctions are obtained similarly from the function y −v .
In his last paper on the method [4], Schrödinger factorized the hypergeometric
equation, ﬁnding that there are several ways of factorizing it. His factorization
procedure originated "from a, virtually, well-known treatment of the oscillator",
i.e., an approach that can be traced back to Dirac’s creation and annihilation
operators for the harmonic oscillator [5] and to older factorization ideas in a paper
of Pauli [6] and in Weyl’s treatment of spherical harmonics with spin [7].
It
should be noted that whereas Dirac’s ﬁrst-order operators were considered only
as a trick (or ‘stratagem’), too insigniﬁcant to replace the Sturm-Liouville theory,
Schrödinger speaks neatly about a method and applies it in a systematic way.
However, Schrödinger’s works were not very much taken into account perhaps
because of the war years.
A decade later, in 1951, Infeld and Hull [8] wrote an inﬂuential paper in which
they introduced a different factorization method that became widely known. They
studied equations of the form

where ˆM(x, m) is an operator of the form

[ ˆM(x, m) + l 0

−

m(x) = 0 ,

ˆM(x, m) =

dx2 + r(x, m)

Nothing noteworthy happened for thirty years until Witten [9] wrote a paper
in which supersymmetric quantum
on dynamical breaking of supersymmetry,
mechanics (SUSYQM) was introduced as a toy model for supersymmetry breaking
in quantum ﬁeld theories.
The SUSY breaking is presented by Witten as a sort of "phase transition" with
the order parameter being the Witten index, deﬁned as the grading operator
t = (
is the fermion number operator. For the case of one-
dimensional SUSYQM, Witten’s index operator is the third Pauli matrix s 3, which
is +1 for the bosonic sector and -1 for the fermionic sector of the one dimensional
quantum problem at hand. It became also quite common to call a particular Riccati
solution as a (Witten) "superpotential". Papers that now are standard references
are published during 1982-1984. For example, a breakthrough algebraic result has
been obtained in 1983 by Gendenshtein [10] who introduced the important concept
of shape invariance (SI) in SUSYQM. The SI property is displayed by some classes
of potentials with respect to their parameter(s), say an, and reads

Vn+1(x, an) = Vn(x, an+1) + R(an) ,

where R should be a remainder independent of x. This property assures a fully
algebraic scheme for the spectrum and wave functions. Fixing E0 = 0, the excited
spectrum is given by the algebraic formula

and the wave functions are obtained from

y n(x, a1) =

A+(x, ak)y 0(x, an+1) .

Another remarkable result of that period is due to Mielnik [11], who provided
the ﬁrst application of the general Riccati solution to the harmonic oscillator,
obtaining a harmonic potential with an additive tail of the type D2[ln erf + const.]
similar to the Abraham-Moses class of isospectral potentials in the area of inverse
scattering. D. Fernández gave a second application to the atomic hydrogen
spectrum, whereas M.M. Nieto clariﬁed further the inverse scattering aspects of
Mielnik’s construction. Mielnik’s procedure may be seen as a double Darboux
transformation in which the general Riccati (superpotential) solution is involved.
In addition, Andrianov and his collaborators [12] discovered the relation between
SUSYQM and Darboux Transformations (DT) or Darboux covariance while
playing with matrix Hamiltonians in SUSYQM.

1.2 Darboux covariance

The Darboux covariance of a Sturm-Liouville equation is clearly stated by
Matveev and Salle [13]. Consider the equation

is the sigma notation of Matveev and Salle for the logarithmic derivative, and W is
the Wronskian determinant. Then, the Darboux-transformed equation becomes

y xx[1] + u[1]y

[1] = ly

[1] ,

−

the spectral parameter l

does not change (a result known as Darboux
i.e.,
isospectrality). When DTs are applied iteratively one gets Crum’s result. One
can also say that the two SL equations are related by a DT.
Following Matveev and Salle, in order to demonstrate the equivalence of SUSYQM
with a single DT we consider two Schrödinger equations

related by DT, i.e., v = u[1] and f = y
satisﬁes the Darboux-transformed equation for l = l 1.

[1], and notice that the function f 1 = y −

If now one uses the second (transformed) equation as initial one and perform the
DT with the generating function f 1, one just goes back to the initial u equation.
That is why one can think of the latter procedure as a sort of inverse DT that can
be obtained from the direct one as follows:

a deformed bosonic system.
An application of this construction to microtubules is presented in Chapter 4.

1.4 The connection with intertwining

Intertwining has been introduced by the French mathematician J. Delsarte
in 1938 [14] as an operatorial relationship involving so-called transformation
(or transmutation) operators but the second World War delayed the detailed
mathematical studies that came only in the 1950’s. By deﬁnition, two operators
L0 and L1 are said to be intertwined by an operator T if

L1T = T L0 .

(1.10)

If the eigenfunctions j 0 of L0 are known, then from the intertwining relation one
can show that the (unnormalized) eigenfunctions of L1 are given by j 1 = T j 0. The

12

main problem in the intertwining transformations is to construct the transformation
operator T . One-dimensional quantum mechanics is one of the simplest examples
of intertwining relations since Witten’s transformation operator Tqm = T1 is just a
ﬁrst spatial derivative plus a differentiable coordinate function (the superpotential)
that should be a logarithmic derivative of the true bosonic zero mode (if it exists),
but of course higher-order transformation operators can be constructed without
much difﬁculty.
Thus, within the realm of the one-dimensional quantum mechanics, writing T1 =
u′
u , where u is a true bosonic zero mode, one can infer that the adjoint operator
D
−
T †
u′
u intertwines in the opposite direction, taking solutions of L1 to those
1 =
of L0

−

−

D

j 0 = T †

(1.11)

and
In particular, for standard one-dimensional quantum mechanics, L0 = H
is annihilated by T1, the cor-
L1 = H+ and although the true zero mode of H
−
responding (unnormalized) eigenfunction of H+ can nevertheless be obtained by
applying T1 to the other independent zero energy solution of H
It is only in
the last decade or so, that the intertwining approach becomes well-known to the
SUSYQM factorization community and some authors start to play with higher-
order generalizations. But, as always, the most important (at least for standard
quantum mechanics) are the simplest cases, namely the Darboux ﬁrst-order inter-
twining operators.

The ﬁrst part of this thesis deals with factorization methods, among which an
original factorization of nonlinear second order ordinary differential equations
(ODE) and supersymmetric techniques, as applied to some biological and physical
systems. Chapters 2 and 3 contain explicitly the new factorization procedure
developed by us to obtain kink type solutions for nonolinear second order ODE
that describe several important processes, for instance, the tubulin polymerization
in microgravity conditions and the pulse propagation along nerve axons. In Chapter
4, supersymmetric approaches are applied in the framework of biological dynamics
of microtubules (MTs);
the latter results are related to transport properties
associated to the MT domain walls. In Chapter 5, applications of supersymmetric
factorization procedures in some physical systems are presented. A complex
extension for the classical harmonic oscillator by means of a direct relationship
between the Dirac and Schröedinger equations is obtained.
the
same procedure is applied to a molecular physics problem in connection with the
dissociation of diatomic molecules.

A new factorization technique for differential equations
with polynomial nonlinearity

Abstract.
In this chapter, it is shown how one can obtain kink solutions of ordinary
differential equations with polynomial nonlinearities by an efﬁcient factorization procedure
directly related to the factorization of their nonlinear polynomial part. This is different
of previous factorization procedures of differential equations of this type that have been
performed by only a few authors, most notably by Berkovich [17]. Of main interest
here because of their numerous applications are the reaction-diffusion equations in the
travelling frame and the damped-anharmonic-oscillator equations. In addition, interesting
pairing of the kink solutions, a result obtained by reversing the factorization brackets in
the supersymmetric quantum mechanical style, are reported. In this way, one gets ordinary
differential equations with a different polynomial nonlinearity possessing kink solutions of
different width but propagating at the same velocity as the kinks of the original equation.
This pairing of kinks could have many applications. The mathematical procedure is
illustrated with several important cases, among which the generalized Fisher equation, the
FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, and the polymerization fronts of microtubules (MTs). In the
latter case, a new polymerization front is predicted that can show up in solutions containing
MTs borne on satellites. Because of the microgravity conditions the polymerization rates
could deviate from the normal ones and this could lead to a change of the width of the
polymerization front.

2.1 Introduction

Factorization of second-order linear differential equations, such as the Schrödinger
equation, is a well established method to get solutions in an algebraic manner
[4, 8, 15]. We are interested in factorizations of ordinary differential equations
(ODE) of the type

u′′ + g u′ + F(u) = 0 ,

(2.1)

If the independent variable is the

time then g
is a damping constant and we are in the case of nonlinear damped
oscillator equations. Many examples of this type are collected in the Appendix
[16]. However, the coefﬁcient g can also play
of a paper of Tuszy´nski et al.
the role of the constant velocity of a travelling front if the independent variable
is a travelling coordinate used to reduce a reaction-diffusion (RD) equation to
the ordinary differential form as brieﬂy sketched in the following. These RD
travelling fronts or kinks are important objects in low dimensional nonlinear
phenomenology describing topologically-switched conﬁgurations in many areas
of biology, ecology, chemistry and physics.
Consider a scalar RD equation for u(x,t)

where D is the diffusion constant and s is the strength of the reaction process.
Eq (2.2) can be rewritten as

¶ u
¶ t

= D

¶ 2u
¶ x2 + sF(u) ,

¶ u
¶ t

=

¶ 2u
¶ x2 + F(u) ,

where the coefﬁcients have been eliminated by the rescalings ˜t = st and ˜x =
(s/D)1/2x, and dropping the tilde. Usually, the scalar RD equation possesses
travelling wave solutions u(x ) with x = x
vt, propagating at speed v. For this
type of solutions the RD equation turns into the ODE

−

u′′ + vu′ + F(u) = 0 ,

(2.4)

dx . Eq. (2.4) has the same form as nonlinear damped oscillator

where ′ = D = d
equations with the velocity playing the role of the friction constant.
For applications in physical optics and acoustics it is convenient to write the
travelling coordinate in the form x = kx
. This is
a simple scaling by k of the previous coordinate turning Eq. (2.4) into the form

Berkovich’s conditions read

b) Grouping of this work: We propose here the different grouping of terms

The following simple relationship exists between the factoring functions:

and further (third, and so forth) factorizations can be obtained through linear
combinations of the functions f1b, f2b and f 2.
Based on our experience, we think that
the grouping we propose is more
convenient than that of Berkovich and also of other people employing more

16

difﬁcult procedures. The main advantage resides in the fact that whereas in
Berkovich’s scheme Eq. (2.11) is still a differential equation to be solved, in
our scheme we make a choice of the factorization functions by merely factoring
polynomial expressions according to Eq. (2.14) and then imposing Eq. (2.15) leads
easily to an n-depending g coefﬁcient for which the factorization works. This fact
makes our approach extremely efﬁcient in ﬁnding particular solutions of the kink
type as one can see in the following.
In the next section, it is shown on the explicit case of the generalized Fisher
equation all the mathematical constructions related to the factorization brackets and
their supersymmetric quantum mechanical like reverse factorization. In less detail,
but within the same approach, damped nonlinear oscillators of Dixon-Tuszy´nski-
Otwinowski type and the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, are studied in Sections 2.3
and 2.4, respectively.

for g > 0. On the other hand, for g < 0 the exponent is the same but of opposite
sign. Hyperbolic forms of the latter solutions are easy to write down and are similar
up to widths to Eqs. (2.21) and (2.23), respectively.
Thus, a different RD equation given by (2.28) with modiﬁed polynomial terms and
its solution have been found by reverting the factorization terms of Eq. (2.17).
Although the reaction polynomial is different the velocity parameter remains the
same. The main result, which is a general one, that we ﬁnd here is the following:
At the velocity corresponding to the travelling kink of a given RD equation there
is another propagating kink corresponding to a different RD equation that is
related to the original one by reverse factorization. We can call this kink as the
supersymmetric (susy) kink because of the mathematical construction.
Finally, one can ask if the process of reverse factorization can be continued with
Eq. (2.28). It can be shown that this is not the case because Eq. (2.28) has already a
discretized (polynomial-order-dependent) g and this fact prevents further solutions
of this type. Suppose we consider the following factorization functions

which implies linearity, and n =
4, which leads to a Milne-Pinney equation. On
the other hand, Eq. (2.28) with an arbitrary g can be treated by the inverse factor-
ization procedure to get the susy partner RD equation and its susy kink.

2.2.4 Subcase n = 6
This subcase is of interest in the light of experiments on polymerization patterns
of MTs in centrifuges.
It has been discovered that the polymerization of the
tubulin dimers proceeds in a kink-switching fashion propagating with a constant
velocity within the sample. Portet, Tuszynski and Dixon [20] used RD equations
to discuss the modiﬁcation of self-organization patterns of MTs as well as the
tubulin polymerization under the inﬂuence of reduced gravitational ﬁelds. They
used the value n = 6 for the mean critical number of tubulin dimers at which the
polymerization process starts and showed that the same nucleation number enters
the polynomial term of the RD process for the number concentration c of tubulin
dimers

2.5 Conclusion of the chapter

In this chapter, we have been concerned with stating an efﬁcient factorization
scheme of ODE with polynomial nonlinearities that leads to an easy ﬁnding of
analytical solutions of the kink type that previously have been obtained by far
more cumbersome procedures. The main result is an interesting pairing between
equations with different polynomial nonlinearities, which is obtained by applying
the susy quantum mechanical reverse factorization. The kinks of the two nonlinear
equations are of different widths but they propagate at the same velocity, or if
we deal with damped polynomial nonlinear oscillators the two kink solutions
correspond to the same friction coefﬁcient. Several important cases, such as
the generalized Fisher and the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations, have been shown to
be simple mathematical exercises for this factorization technique. The physical
prediction is that for commonly occurring propagating fronts, there are two kink
fronts of different widths at a given propagating velocity. Moreover, the reverse
factorization procedure can be also applied to the Berkovich scheme with similar
results.
It will be interesting to apply the approach of this work to the discrete
case in which various exact results have been obtained in recent years [23]. More
general cases in which the coefﬁcient g
is an arbitrary function are also of much
interest because of possible applications. The same factorization scheme as it
works for more complicated ordinary differential equations is described in the next
chapter.

Application to more general nonlinear differential
equations

Abstract.
In the previous chapter we considered the coefﬁcient in front of the ﬁrst
derivative as a constant quantity. However, the employed factorization technique can be
used almost unchanged for the more general case when the condition of constancy of this
coefﬁcient is relaxed.
In this chapter, we obtain more kink type solutions through the
same factorization procedure for a number of more general nonlinear ordinary second order
differential equations with important applications in biology and physics.

3.1 Introduction

Considering the following type of differential equation

u′′ + g(u)u′ + F(u) = 0

where again as in the previous chapter ′ means the derivative D = d
one can factorize Eq. (3.1) in the following form

dx and x = x

f 2(u)] [D

f 1(u)] u = 0.

(3.6)

If F(u) is a polynomial function, then g(u) will have the same order as the bigger
of the factorizing functions f 1(u) and f 2(u), and will also be a function of the
constant parameters provided by the function F(u).
In the context of classical mechanics, Eq. (3.1) could be seen as an anharmonic
oscillator with nonlinear damping. The case g(u) = n where n
is a constant
value has been presented in the previous chapter.
There, by means of a
simple factorization method exact particular solutions of the kink type for
reaction-diffusion equations and damped-anharmonic oscillators with polynomial
nonlinearities have been obtained.
In addition, SUSYQM-like reversing of
factorization brackets has been performed providing new kink solutions for
equations with different polynomial nonlinearities.
Based on the given grouping in Eq. (3.4) for Eq. (3.1), a simple mathematical
procedure is proposed by which one gets particular solutions through factorization
methods that allows ﬁnding solutions satisfying a compatible (nonlinear) ﬁrst order
differential equation.
The purpose of this chapter is to further apply this mathematical scheme to a wealth
of important cases for which explicit particular solutions are not easy to ﬁnd in the
literature or are obtained by more involved techniques. The examples we present
herein are the modiﬁed Emden equation, the Generalized Lienard equation, the
convective Fisher equation, the generalized Burgers-Huxley equation, all of whom
have signiﬁcant applications in nonlinear physics. Explicit particular solutions are
presented.

b u ,

3.6 Conclusion of the chapter

In this chapter, we apply the same factorization scheme for more complicated
second order nonlinear differential equations as in Chapter 2. Exact particular
solutions have been found for a series of nonlinear differential equations with
applications in physics and biology: the modiﬁed Emden equation, the generalized
Lienard equation, the Dufﬁng-van der Pol equation, the convective Fisher equation,
and the generalized Burgers-Huxley equation. Also, we display parametric curves
along which the differential equations under consideration could be factorized. We
ﬁnd that the proposed factorization procedure is easier and more efﬁcient than other
methods used to ﬁnd particular solutions of second order differential equations.

One-parameter supersymmetry for microtubules

Abstract. The simple supersymmetric model of Caticha [34] as used by Rosu [33] to
describe the motion of ferrodistortive domain walls in microtubules (MTs), is generalized
to the case of Mielnik’s one-parameter nonrelativistic supersymmetry [11]. By this means,
one can introduce Montroll double-well potentials with singularities that move along the
positive or negative travelling direction depending on the sign of the free parameter of
Mielnik’s method. Possible interpretations of the singularity are microtubule associated
proteins (motors) or structural discontinuities in the arrangement of the tubulin molecules.

4.1 Introduction

Based on well-established results of Collins, Blumen, Currie and Ross [29] regarding
the dynamics of domain walls in ferrodistortive materials, Tuszy´nski and collaborators
[30, 31] considered MTs to be ferrodistortive and studied kinks of the Montroll type [32]
as excitations responsible for the energy transfer within this highly interesting biological
context.
The Euler-Lagrange dimensionless equation of motion of ferrodistortive domain walls as
derived in [29] from a Ginzburg-Landau free energy with driven ﬁeld and dissipation
included is of the travelling reaction-diffusion type

. The latter relationship allows one to use a simple
construction method of exactly soluble double-well potentials in the Schrödinger equation
proposed by Caticha [34].
The scheme is a non-standard application of Witten’s
supersymmetric quantum mechanics [9] having as the essential assumption the idea of
considering the M kink as the switching function between the two lowest eigenstates of the
Schrödinger equation with a double-well potential. Thus

where f 0,1 are solutions of f
u(x )]f 0,1(x ) = 0, and u(x ) is the double-well
potential to be found. Substituting Eq. (4.5) into the Schrödinger equation for the subscript
1 and substracting the same equation multiplied by the switching function for the subscript
0, one obtains

and e = e 1
e 0 is the lowest energy splitting in the double-well Schrödinger equation.
In addition, notice that Eq. (4.6) is the basic equation introducing the superpotential R in
Witten’s supersymmetric quantum mechanics, i.e., the Riccati solution. For Montroll’s
kink the corresponding Riccati solution reads

4.3 The Mielnik extension

We now discuss shortly in this context the Mielnik extension of these results [11, 3]. The
point is that RM in Eq. (4.8) is only the particular solution of Eq. (4.11). The general
solution is a one-parameter function of the form

RM(x ; l ) = RM(x ) +

it is on the positive side. Potentials and wave
functions with singularities are not so strange as it seems [37] and could be quite relevant
even in nanotechnology [38] where quantum singular interactions of the contact type
are appropriate for describing nanoscale quantum devices. We interpret the singularity
as representing the effect of an impurity moving along the MT in one direction or the
other depending on the sign of the parameter l
. The impurity may represent a protein
attached to the MT or a structural discontinuity in the arrangement of the tubulin molecules.
This interpretation of impurities has been given by Trpišová and Tuszy´nski in non-
supersymmetric models of nonlinear MT excitations [39].

4.4 Conclusion of the chapter

In conclusion, the supersymmetric approaches allow for a number of interesting exact
results in this biological framework and point to a direct connection between Schrödinger
double-well potentials and nonlinear kinks encountered in nonequilibrium chemical
processes. MTs are an important application but the procedures described here can be used
in many other applications. Moreover, the supersymmetric constructions can be used as a
background for clarifying further details of the exact models. Although it is not so clear
why one should take a certain type of kink as switching function between the Schrödinger
split modes, it is interesting that proceeding in this way one will be led to some familiar
double-well potentials in chemical physics.

Supersymmetric method with Dirac parameters

Abstract. In this chapter we ﬁrst describe a "supersymmetric" one-dimensional matrix
procedure similar to relationships of the same type between Dirac and Schrödinger
equations in particle physics that we apply to two problems in classical mechanics and
quantum mechanics, respectively.
In the ﬁrst case, we obtain a class of parametric
oscillation modes that we call K-modes with damping and absorption that are connected
to the classical harmonic oscillator modes through this supersymmetric procedure that is
characterized by coupling parameters. When a single coupling parameter, denoted by K,
is used, it characterizes both the damping and the dissipative features of these modes.
Generalizations to several K parameters are also possible and lead to analytical results. If
the problem is passed to the physical optics (and/or acoustics) context by switching from
the oscillator equation to the corresponding Helmholtz equation, one may hope to detect
the K-modes as waveguide modes of specially designed waveguides and/or cavities. In
the second case, the same method is presented in a style appropriate for truly quantum
mechanical problems and an application to the Morse potential is performed. We obtain
the corresponding nonhermitic Morse problem with possible applications to the diffraction
on optical lattices.

5.1 Introduction

Factorizations of differential operators describing simple mechanical motion have been
only occasionally used in the past, although in quantum mechanics the procedure led
to a vast literature under the name of supersymmetric quantum mechanics initiated by
a paper of Witten [9]. However, as shown by Rosu and Reyes [40], for the damped
Newtonian free oscillator the factorization method could generate interesting results even
in an area settled more than three centuries ago. In this chapter, we apply some of the
supersymmetric schemes to the basic classical harmonic oscillator. In particular, we show
how a known connection in particle physics between Dirac and Schrödinger equations
could lead in the case of harmonic motion to chirped (i.e., time-dependent) frequency
oscillator equations whose solutions are a class of oscillatory modes depending on one

46

more parameter, denoted in the following by K, besides the natural circular frequency w 0.
The parameter K characterizes both the damping and the losses of these "supersymmetric"
partner modes. Moreover, we do not limit this study to one K parameter extending it to
several such parameters still getting analytic results. Guided by mathematical equivalence,
possible applications in several areas of physics are identiﬁed. Moreover, in the ﬁnal part
of the chapter the same supersymmetric scheme is used in the context of exactly solvable
quantum problem of the Morse potential. A nonhermitic version of the Morse problem is
introduced in this way.

5.2 Classical harmonic oscillator: The Riccati approach

The harmonic oscillator can be described by one of the simplest Riccati equation

where the plus sign is for the normal case whereas the minus sign is for the up side down
case. Indeed, employing u = w′

It is well known that the particular Riccati solutions enter as nonoperatorial part in the
common factorizations of the second-order linear differential equations that are directly
related to the Darboux isospectral transformations [13].
Thus, for Eq. (5.2) one gets (Dt = d

To ﬁx the ideas, we shall use the terminology of Witten’s supersymmetric quantum
mechanics and call Eq. (5.3) the bosonic equation. We stress here that the supersymmetric
terminology is used only for convenience and should not be taken literally. Thus, the
supersymmetric partner (or fermionic) equation of Eq. (5.3) is obtained by reversing the

and thus present strong periodic singularities in the ﬁrst case and just one singularity at the
origin in the second case. These ‘partner’ oscillators, as well as those to be discussed in
the following, are parametric oscillators, i.e., of time-dependent frequency. Moreover, their
frequencies can become inﬁnite (periodically). In general, signals of this type are known
as chirps. "Inﬁnite" chirps could be produced, in principle, in very special astrophysical
circumstances, e.g., close to black hole horizons [41].

This shows that the matrix equation is equivalent to the two second-order linear differential
equations of bosonic and fermionic type, Eq. (5.2) and Eq. (5.4), respectively, a result quite
well known in particle physics. Indeed, a comparison with the true Dirac equation with a

shows that Eq. (5.6) corresponds to a Dirac spinor of ‘zero mass’ and ‘zero energy’ in
an imaginary scalar ‘potential’ iup(t). We remind that a detailed discussion of the Dirac
equation in the supersymmetric approach has been provided by Cooper et al [42] in 1988.
They showed that the Dirac equation with a Lorentz scalar potential is associated with a
susy pair of Schrödinger Hamiltonians. This result has been used later by many authors in
the particle physics context [43].

5.4 Extension through parameter K

We now come to the main issue of this work. Consider the slightly more general Dirac-like
equation

ˆDKW

[s yDt + s x(iup + K)]W = KW ,

≡

(5.11)

where K is a (not necessarily positive) real constant. On the left hand side of the equation,
K stands as an (imaginary) mass parameter of the Dirac spinor, whereas on the right hand
side it corresponds to the energy parameter. Thus, we have an equation equivalent to a
Dirac equation for a spinor of mass iK at the ﬁxed energy E = iK. This equation can be
written as the following system of coupled equations

iDtw1 + (iup + K)w1 = Kw2
iDtw2 + (iup + K)w2 = Kw1 .

−

The decoupling can be achieved by applying the operator in Eq. (5.12) to Eq. (5.13). For
the fermionic spinor component one gets

Examining the bosonic equations, one can immediately see that the resonant frequencies
acquired resistive time-dependent losses whose relative strength is given by the parameter
K. The fermionic equations having time-dependent real parts of the frequency can
be interpreted as parametric oscillators which are also affected by losses through the
imaginary part.

5.6 Possible applications of the K-modes

5.6.1 Waveguides.
In view of the correspondence between mechanics and optics, one can also provide
an interpretation in terms of the Helmholtz optics for light propagation in waveguides
of special proﬁles. The supersymmetry of the Helmholtz equation has been studied
by Wolf and collaborators [44]. To get the waveguide application, one should switch
x along which we
from the temporal independent variable to a spatial variable t
consider the inhomogeneity of the ﬁber whereas the propagation of beams is along
another supplementary spatial coordinate z. Thus, we turn the equations (5.55)-(5.56)
into Helmholtz waveguide equations of the type (we take c = 1)

previous sections.

According to Chumakov and Wolf [44] a second waveguide interpretation is possible
describing two different Gaussian beams, bosonic and fermionic, whose small difference in
frequency is given in terms of a small parameter e (wavelength/beam width), propagating
in the same waveguide. In this interpretation, the index proﬁle is the same for both beams.
For illustration, let us take the normal oscillator Riccati solution in the space variable
x, i.e., tank0x that we approximate to ﬁrst order linear Taylor term k0x. Then, the two
beam interpretation leads to the following Riccati equation (for details, see the paper of
Chumakov and Wolf)

An almost exact, up to nonlinear corrections of order e 2 and higher, supersymmetric
pairing of the z wavenumbers (propagating constants) occurs, except for the ‘ground state’
one. As noted by Chumakov and Wolf, supersymmetry connects in this case light beams
of different frequencies but having the same wavelength in the propagation direction z.
This approach is valid only in the paraxial approximation. Therefore, one should know the
small x behavior of the K-modes in order to hope to detect them through stable interference
patterns along the waveguide axis.

5.6.2 Cavity physics.
Another very interesting application of the K-modes in a radial variable could be
Schumann’s resonances, i.e., the resonant frequencies of the spherical cavity provided by
the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere plasma layer [45]. The Schumann problem can be
r + k2]f = 0 with Robin type (mixed)
approached as a spherical Helmholtz equation [(cid:209) 2

integrals of Helmholtz solutions with Neumann boundary conditions
noting the similarity between these improved values of Schumann’s eigenfrequencies and
the K-eigenfrequencies. Moreover, using the Q parameter of the cavity, one can write
Eq. (5.41) in the form

This form shows that the modiﬁcation of the real part of w
leads to a downward shift of
the resonant frequencies, while the contribution to the imaginary component changes the
rate of decay of the modes.
We point out that Jackson mentions in his textbook that the near equality of the real and
imaginary parts of the change in w 2 is a consequence of the employed boundary condition,
which is appropriate for relatively good conductors. Thus, by changing the form of C(w )
that could result from different surface impedances, the relative magnitude of the real
and imaginary parts of the change in w 2 can be made different. It is this latter case that
corresponds better to the K-modes.

5.6.3 Crystal models.
There is also a strong mathematical similarity between the K-modes and the solutions
V0cosec2(p x/a),
of Scarf’s crystal model [46] based on the singular potential V (x) =
where a is an arbitrary lattice parameter. For this model the one-dimensional Schrödinger
equation has the form

where f (x) = sin(p x/a) corresponds to the zi(t) functions, and s and l corresponding to
-p and -q, respectively, are related to the potential amplitude and energy spectral parameter.
Thus, by turning the K-oscillator equations into corresponding Schrödinger equations, one
could introduce another analytical crystal model with possible applications in photonics
crystals.

5.6.4 Cosmology.
Rosu and López-Sandoval apply the K-mode approach to barotropic FRW cosmologies
[47]. K- Hubble cosmological parameters have been introduced and expressed as
0
logarithmic derivatives of the K-modes with respect to the conformal time. For K
the ordinary solutions of the common FRW barotropic ﬂuids have been obtained.
It is also worth noticing the analogy of the nonzero K oscillator case with the phenomenon
of diffraction of atomic waves in imaginary crystals of light (crossed laser beams) [48]. In
fact, the K parameter is a counterpart of the modulation parameter Q introduced by Berry
and O’Dell in their study of imaginary optical gratings. Roughly speaking, the nonzero
K modes could occur in an imaginary crystal of time that could occur in some exotic
astrophysical conditions.

5.7 Quantum mechanics with Riccati nonhermiticity

We have elaborated in the previous sections on an interesting way of introducing imaginary
parts (nonhermiticities) in second order differential equations starting from a Dirac-
like matrix equation [47, 49]. The procedure is a complex extension of the known
supersymmetric connection between the Dirac matrix equation and the Schrödinger
equation. A detailed discussion of the Dirac equation in the supersymmetric approach
has been provided by Cooper et al. [42, 43] in 1988, who showed that the Dirac equation
with a Lorentz scalar potential is associated with a susy pair of Schrödinger Hamiltonians.
In the supersymmetric approach one uses the fact that the Dirac potential, that we denote
by S, is the solution of a Riccati equation with the free term related to the potential function
U in the second order linear differential equations of the Schrödinger type.

However, we have employed the method for the case of the classical harmonic oscillator,
which is the very speciﬁc situation in which the Dirac mass parameter that we denoted
by K was treated as a free parameter equal to the Dirac eigenvalue parameter E. This
is equivalent to Schrödinger equations at zero energy, e = 0. On the other hand, it is
interesting to see how the method works for negative energies, i.e., for a bound spectrum
in quantum mechanics. Here we brieﬂy describe the method and next apply it to the case
of Morse potential.

5.8 Complex extension with a single K parameter

We consider the slightly different Dirac-like equation with respect to Eq. (5.45)

ˆDKW

[s yDx + s x(iR + K)]W = KW ,

where K is a (not necessarily positive) real constant. In the left hand side of the equation,
K stands as a mass parameter of the Dirac spinor, whereas on the right hand side it
corresponds to the energy parameter. R is an arbitrary solution of the Riccati equation
of the Witten type [9]

5.11 Conclusion of the chapter

By a procedure involving the factorization connection between the Dirac-like equations
and the simple second-order linear differential equations of harmonic oscillator type,
a class of classical modes with a Dirac-like parameter describing their damping and
absorption (dissipation) has been introduced in this chapter. While for zero values of the
Dirac parameters the highly singular fermionic modes are decoupled from their normal
bosonic harmonic modes, at nonzero values a coupling between the two types of modes is
introduced at the level of the matrix equation. These interesting modes are given by the
solutions of the Eqs. (5.55)-(5.33) and in a more general way by Eqs. (5.27), (5.34)-(5.35)
and are expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. Several possible applications
in different ﬁelds of physics are mentioned as well. Finally, similar to the fact that the
PT quantum mechanics can be considered as a complex extension of standard quantum
mechanics, we notice that what we have done here is a particular type of complex extension
of the classical harmonic oscillator. The complex supersymmetric extension introduced in
the ﬁrst sections has been applied to exactly solvable quantum Morse problem. The bosonic
and fermionic wave functions have been obtained in explicit form. This complex extension
could have applications to the diffraction of diatomic molecules on optical lattices (systems
of laser beams).

Preliminary remarks on Part II

The following remarks are pointed out in order to describe the relationship between Part
I and Part II of the thesis work, where factorization methods for nonlinear ODE and
synchronization of a neuronal ensemble through feedback methods, respectively, have
been developed. The study of many biological systems from a mathematical point of
view is very stimulating because of the possibilities to forecast the dynamic behavior of
such biological systems. An important example is the neuronal dynamics that governs
many living organisms. The neuronal dynamics performs the processing of biological
information by means of transmitted signals. The pulse propagation along a nerve axon
as described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation that was solved in Section 2.4 through
factorization methods is given by a travelling signal of the kink type. The kink solution
represents the transition between two stable equilibrium states, and the "level change"
travelling waves are transmitted along the neuron axon [50].
It is a very interesting
challenge to study the synchronization dynamics for a minimal ensemble of two neurons.
However, the kink type solutions that have been considered by us could not describe
the most realistic dynamical behavior for the neuronal ensemble. In fact, the FitzHugh-
Nagumo neuron model can be shown to be an approximation (see, e.g.
[50]) of the
widely known Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model [69]. Therefore, the problem of
neurons synchronization has been addressed in the more realistic case of the HH neuron
model. Although theoretical attempts have been made to obtain analytical solutions of
the travelling wave type for the HH systems (see, e.g. [51, 52]), it is an easier task to
achieve numerical results to study the synchronization dynamics. That is why we do not
pay attention to the HH travelling waves in the second part. The nonlinear control theory
is a very suitable way to study and search for the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the
synchronization phenomena. In the next Chapters 7 and 8, the problem of synchronizing a
minimal ensemble of two HH neurons is stated, and results on its synchronized dynamics
are achieved by implementing adequate feedback schemes.

Synchronization of chaotic dynamics and neuronal
systems

Abstract. In this chapter, the synchronization phenomena and the concept of chaos, their
importance in natural process and engineering systems are reviewed. A brief overview of
synchronization methods for the control of chaos and its applications in biological systems
is presented. Neuronal synchronization activity and its role on brain dynamics is also
discussed in order to state the problem of neuronal synchronization employing nonlinear
control theory tools.
In addition, the dynamical model for the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)
neurons is described.

7.1 Introduction

Synchronization phenomena are very important processes occurring in nature and often
produced as a desired behavior in engineering systems.
In very general terms, the
synchronization of coupled systems means "to share time or events". It refers to the way in
which networked elements, due to their dynamics, communicate and exhibit collective
behavior [53].
Some examples are the observed synchronized ﬂashing of ﬁreﬂies,
synchronization of cells in a beating heart, the quantum synchronization in superﬂuidity
and superconductivity, in the phenomena related to Josephson tunneling. Other important
examples are the generated synchronization in computer chips, communication systems
and global positioning systems.
On the other hand, the disquieting question about the exact forecast of the evolution in time
of diverse systems produced the discovery of the existence of chaos. The concept of chaos
usually refers to the issue of whether or not it is possible to make long-term predictions
about the behavior of a system. There exist several mathematical deﬁnitions of chaos,
however, all of them express the property of high sensitivity to the initial conditions. Such
a characteristic implies that two even arbitrarily close trajectories, separate exponentially
in the course of time. A deterministic system is said to be chaotic if necessary requirements
of nonlinearity and dimensionality (of at least three) are characteristic for that system [54].

66

During the last ﬁfteen years there have been an increased interest in studying chaotic
systems, since the proved fact that chaos "cannot be forecasted but it can be controlled"
[55]. The issue of the control of chaos is of interest for both theorist and control engineers.
Interest arises because of many observations show that the chaotic behavior is common in
nature, for instance, chaotic dynamics can be found in meteorology, plasma physics, heart
and brain of living organisms; and experimental results dealing with the control of chaotic
systems lead us to practically an unlimited amount of technical applications in mechanical
and space engineering, electrical and electronic systems, communication and information
systems, etc. [56].
Two applications of the control of chaos have been widely studied for the past few year:
the control and use of chaos for communication systems, and the synchronization (and
suppression) of chaotic dynamics for several communication schemes [54, 57].
In the following section a review of synchronization methods concerning the control of
chaotic dynamics and its applications in biological systems is presented. Then we focus
on synchronization of a neuronal system comprised of two isolated HH neurons, whose
dynamical model is also described in ﬁnal section.
In Chapter 8, the obtained results
employing the mathematical tools provided by the nonlinear control theory [58], that can
be applied in order to show the way the HH neurons can synchronize are presented. We
ﬁnd that isolated neurons unidirectionally couple and synchronize through feedback action.
In addition, robust synchronization dynamics is obtained by implementing a dynamic
compensator.

7.2 Synchronization methods for the control of chaos

Many approaches have been proposed to control chaotic dynamics of systems. Open loop
or non feedback methods and closed loop or feedback methods [54, 55, 56] have been
developed in order to produce the desired behavior in chaotic systems. Two basic problems
concerning the control of chaotic dynamics through feedback methods are identiﬁed:
synchronization and suppression of chaos. Suppression of chaos consists in stabilization
of the system around regular orbits or equilibrium points. The chaos synchronization
problem has the characteristic that the receiver (slave) system must track in some sense
the trajectories of the sender (master) system [59]. Because of uncertainties may appear in
the chaos control problem, adaptive schemes are implemented in order to achieve robust
synchronization dynamics. Synchronization can be achieved for identical chaotic systems
with (obviously) different initial conditions [60], however, researchers have found that
non identical systems synchronize when adequate developed feedback schemes are applied
[59, 61, 86].
From the standpoint of the geometrical control theory, the synchronization problem can
be seen as a stabilization problem. For a deﬁned synchronization error xe = xe,M
xe,S,
where xe represents the difference between the master and slave system states, and
Rd, e = 1, 2, ..., d, there exists a synchronization error system [61] whose trajectories
x
exponentially converge to zero under a feedback control action; consequently, the master
and slave systems unidirectionally couple.
In the following chapter, the statement of the synchronization problem and its solution
using the geometrical control theory for a proposed chaotic neuronal system is explained
in detail. Also, because of appearing uncertain system states,
i.e., non accurately
measured states, an adaptive scheme is implemented via construction of a state observer or
uncertainty estimator that guarantees robust synchronization.

7.3 Applications of synchronization methods in biological systems

Synchronization methods for the control of chaos where feedback action is implemented
have a wide variety of technical and scientiﬁc applications. Among the main technical
applications of chaos synchronization can be found a diversity of schemes for communica-
tion systems. The scientiﬁc applications are directed to study properties, regularities, and
mechanisms of the behavior of physical, chemical and biological systems. Moreover, very
interesting results are obtained when the control methods are applied to experimental sys-
tems. Examples of suppression and synchronization of chaos can be found in biomechani-
cal systems, medicine, biology and ecology: design of feedback pacemakers, suppression
of oscillating epileptiform activity in neural networks, control of population dynamics in
plankton and other biological species, etc.
The main interest in Part II is to apply feedback synchronization methods to a chaotic
neuronal system. Two HH neurons are regarded as a system of two dynamical subsystems,
with the aim to show that synchronized dynamics is achieved through feedback strategies.
Synchronization and suppression of chaos, using the tools of control theory, could provide
insights to understand and show their relevance in the processing of biological information
in neural networks.

7.4 Synchronized dynamics of neurons

Synchronization of neuronal activity patterns (action potentials) is a fundamental
topic in the modern research of brain dynamics. Experimental evidence reveals that
synchronization phenomena are basic for the processing of biological information. It has
been demonstrated [62] that large ensembles of neurons whose functionality is related to
visual perception synchronize their oscillatory activity (in the gamma frequency range, 40-
60 Hz) when stimulated. Some researchers consider that neuronal synchronization allows
the brain to solve the so-called binding problem [63]. Take for example a car: it may be
characterized by its shape, color, emitted noise, and so on. All these features are processed
in different parts of the brain, however we conceive the car as a single entity because of
still unknown binding procedures. More recent studies suggest that synchronization is a
basic mechanism for consciousness [64, 65, 66]. Also, Parkinsonian tremor and epileptic
seizures are closely related with this mechanism [63, 67].
Recently, it was shown that two coupled living neurons synchronize their activity patterns
when depolarized by an external current [68]. However, the whole underlying mechanisms
are not completely understood. From a theoretical point of view, neurons are considered
as nonlinear oscillators. A lot of theoretical studies have been carried out to investigate
the dynamics of single neurons and neural networks. The most employed and realistic
neuron models are the Hodgkin-Huxley and the FitzHugh-Nagumo systems [63], that have
been used in detailed studies of neuron behavior under external forcing. Moreover, within
these models one can consider the change of dynamical parameters and implications on the
neuronal activity, for instance, the strength of synaptic conductance, and intrinsic or added
noise. The neuronal synchronization problem is addressed regarding diffusive coupling, or
modelling unidirectionally coupled master-slave systems. Many people believe that control
theory could be very useful to address the problem of synchronization in ensembles of
neurons. The mathematical tools provided by the nonlinear control theory, can suitably be
applied to the mathematical model of a system comprised of two noiseless HH neurons.

7.5 The Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron

The brain is the most complex system known to us. Understanding the way it works and its
structure has been a very interesting research issue during many decades. The basic units
which integrate the brain tissue and, in general, any nervous system, are the nerve cells
or neurons. The transmission of signals and the processing of biological information are
carried out through complicated interactions between large ensembles of neurons. External
and internal stimuli generate the biological information which propagates from the sensory
sites to speciﬁc areas of the brain, for instance, the visual, olfactory and auditive perception,
and the conscious sensory-motor activity.
Most of the nerve cells generate a series of voltage spiking sequences called the membrane
action potential, in response to external stimuli performing the information processing.
These pulses of the action potential originate at the cell body and propagate down the
axon at constant amplitude and velocity. They can be transmitted via synaptic coupling to
another nerve cell which is stimulated by the corresponding current. The electric behavior
of the cell axon membrane is described by the net ion ﬂux through a great amount of
potassium and sodium ionic channels; each ion passing from the inner (outer) to the outer
(inner) side of the cell. It is known that potassium and sodium channels are composed
of four independent gates, which can be in a permissive or non permissive state. The
potassium ions cross the membrane only through channels that are speciﬁc for potassium.
If the four gates of a potassium channel are in permissive state, then the channel is open
and potassium ions ﬂow through it. The sodium ions cross the membrane only through
channels that are speciﬁc for sodium. Three of the gates for a sodium channel are activation
gates, and one is inactivation gate. All of them must be in permissive state to allow sodium
ions to cross the sodium channel.
Several neuron models have been proposed to describe the dynamics of the action
potentials. However, the most widely used is still the realistic HH neuron model [69]. In
the early 1950’s, Hodgkin and Huxley developed and published a series of investigations
where they studied the electrophysiology of the squid giant axon. Their results allow them
to calculate the total membrane current as the sum of the potassium and calcium ionic
channels currents and the capacitive current,

Im(t) = Iionic(t) + Cm

dV (t)
dt

.

In addition, based on the large number of realized experiments they postulated a phe-
nomenological model that turned itself into a paradigm for the generation of the action
potential in the squid axon. We follow next the recent discussion in the book of C. Koch
[70] for a compact presentation of the main statements of the HH model:

1. The action potential involves two major voltage-dependent ionic conductances, a sodium
conductance gNa and a potassium conductance gK. They are independent from each other.
A third, smaller "leak" conductance gl does not depend on the membrane potential. The
total ionic current ﬂowing is given by the following equation

2. The individual ionic currents Ii(t) are linearly related to driving potential via Ohm’s law,

(7.2)

(7.3)

Iionic(t) = INa + IK + Ileak.

Ii(t) = gi(V (t),t)(V (t)

Ei)

−

69

where the ionic reversal potential Ei is given by Nernst’s equation for the appropriate ionic
species. Depending on the balance between the concentration difference of the ions and
the electrical ﬁeld across the membrane separating the intracellular cytoplasm from the
extracellular milieu, each ionic species has an associated "ionic battery". Conceptually,
there exist an equivalent electrical circuit to describe the axonal membrane.
3. Each of the two ionic conductances is expressed as a maximum conductance, gNa
and gK, multiplied by a numerical coefﬁcient representing the fraction of the maximum
conductance actually open. These numbers are functions of one or more ﬁctive gating
particles Hodgkin and Huxley introduced to describe the dynamics of the conductances.
In their original model, they talked about activating and inactivating gating particles. Each
gating particle can be in one of two possible states, open or close, depending on time and on
the membrane potential. In order for the conductance to open, all of these gating particles
must be open simultaneously. The entire kinetic properties of their model are contained in
these variables.
The gating particles, also known as gating variables, Hodgkin and Huxley presented are
usually denoted by n, m and h. They are the same as the currently known ion channel gates.
The following set of four coupled nonlinear differential equations represents the complete

sodium channel gate being in the permissive state (inactivation of the sodium ﬂow current).
Gating variables are dimensionless and within the range [0, 1]. Cm is the membrane
capacitance, gK, gNa and gl are the maximum ionic and leak conductances, while VK, VNa

Unidirectional synchronization of Hodgkin-Huxley
neurons

Abstract. Synchronization dynamics of two noiseless Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons
under the action of feedback control is studied. The spiking patterns of the action potentials
evoked by periodic external modulations attain synchronization states under the feedback
action. Numerical simulations for the synchronization dynamics of regular-irregular
desynchronized spiking sequences are displayed. The results are discussed in context of
generalized synchronization. It is also shown that the HH neurons can be synchronized in
face of unmeasured states.

8.1 Introduction

For several decades many attempts have been addressed to understand the processing
of biological information in single neurons and neural networks. Experimental reports
[71, 72, 73] suggest that the synchronization plays a very important role in the processing
of information by large ensembles of neurons. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a
minimal ensemble of two coupled living neurons ﬁre synchronized spiking activity when
depolarized by an external DC current [74]. However, total neural mechanisms underlying
synchronization are not well understood yet. The Hodgkin-Huxley neurons are usually
used as realistic models of neuronal systems, for studying neuronal synchronization.
Some theoretical approaches investigate the synchronization phenomena considering
diffusive coupling and the inﬂuence of intrinsic noise as a promoter of neuronal activity
[75, 76], and studying the synchronization dynamics related to the rhythmic oscillations
phenomena (theta and gamma frequency rhythms) in neurons of localized areas of the
brain [77, 78, 79]. In addition, the forcing of HH neurons by external stimulus has been
widely studied [80, 81, 82, 83, 84] for tonic or periodic currents that trigger the action
potential displaying spike activity and refractory dynamics.
On the other hand, synchronization of chaotic systems is a relatively recent phenomena
[60] which can be understood from nonlinear geometrical control theory [59, 61]. In this
chapter we study the synchronized behavior of two silent (i.e., the autonomous HH systems
exhibit ﬁxed point dynamics) [81] HH neurons, proposing an unidirectionally coupled

71

synchronization system. In the chaos synchronization problem the trajectories of a slave
system must track, in some sense, the trajectories of a master system even though slave
and master systems may be different. The obtained results contribute in the theoretical
framework of neurons synchronization, and relates the phenomena to the well-posed
concept of generalized synchronization (GS) [85]. Because of uncertain states cannot be
accurately measured in practice, they are not available to do control, for instance, the ionic
channels activation. Then, an approach for robust synchronization via construction of an
uncertainty estimator, is implemented.
The organization of this chapter is as follows. In Section 8.2 the HH neuronal systems are
described. The statement of the problem for unidirectionally coupling synchronization of
HH neurons is given in Section 8.3. The HH neuronal synchronization dynamics obtained
through a stabilizing control law is studied in Section 8.4. In Section 8.5 the generalized
and robust synchronization are discussed, and a ﬁnal conclusion section is given.

8.2 The Hodgkin-Huxley system redeﬁned

We redeﬁne the HH system of equations in order to state the synchronization problem of
two HH neurons. Let xi,M and xi,S (i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and subscripts M, S stand for the master
and slave system, respectively) be the four variables V , n, m and h in each system. As
the meaning of synchronous behavior is “to share time or events”, we shall consider two
HH neurons modelled by Eqs. (7.4)-(7.7). Thus, the master system is represented by the
following set of equations:

and the slave system is proposed to be governed by the equations:

xe,S (where x

In the nonlinear control theory a synchronization problem can be stated as a feedback
stabilization one [61, 86].
It has been established that for a deﬁned synchronization
there exists a synchronization
error, xe = xe,M
error (dynamical) system [61] whose trajectories exponentially converge to zero under
a feedback control u. Hence,
the master and slave systems
it can be said that
(unidirectionally) couple and attain a synchronization dynamical state under the action
of the control command u. The following deﬁnition of Exact Synchronization is presented
in [59]:
Deﬁnition 1.
synchronization error, xe = xe,M
that at a ﬁnite time xe,S = xe,M.
In this section, a proof for the Exact Synchronization of two HH neurons is provided.

It is said that two chaotic systems are exactly synchronized if the
xe,S, exponentially converges to the origin. This implies

Because of the system (8.12)-(8.15) is minimum-phase (see Appendix A at the end of the

new induced dynamics of the slave system. The master and slave systems unidirectionally
couple through u; also parametric differences have been subtracted. The term containing
the convergence rate C0 can be interpreted as a synaptic-like control current (divided by a
constant capacitance) being C0CmM a constant synaptic conductance. In the framework of

Note that the nonlinear feedback (8.11) requires information about currents ﬂowing
through the membrane and the ionic channels of the master and slave neurons. Such a
coupling cannot be implemented in practice on real neurons. However, as we shall see
below, the controller (8.11) allows to discuss the robust synchronization in context of GS,
which is the most signiﬁcant phenomenon in chaotic synchronization. Thus, once neuron
synchronization is discussed in terms of GS, the robust synchronization is proposed by
relaxing the nonlinear controller (8.11) towards a linear approach. This linear approach is
robust in the sense that synchronization is induced in face of parameter mismatches and
differences between amplitud and frequency parameters in external current entering into
master and slave neurons.

In what follows we show how the GS can be studied in HH neurons by departing from
Lemma 1 and Fact 1. To this end, we can separately transform both master and slave
neurons. In this manner, we shall derive the maps F M(xM) and F

Now, it should be pointed out that driving signal (8.10) has full information about states of
both master and slave neurons. This situation cannot be physically realizable (for example,
currents due to the ionic channels activity cannot be available for feedback).
In next
paragraphs, a robust approach is taken from open literature to show how the HH neurons
can be synchronized.

8.5.2 Robust synchronization
The nonlinear controller (8.11) allows to obtain states of Exact Synchronization for the
silent HH neurons represented by systems (8.1)-(8.8). However, because of measurements
for activation and inactivation of the ionic channels cannot be physically carried out,
implementation of the control action (8.11) would be unpractical. Then, an adaptive
scheme to yield robust synchronization is realized by using a modiﬁed feedback control
law. The synchronization error system (8.9) can be represented in the following extended
form [61],

˙z1 = h + b E(z)u,

˙h = G (z1, h , n , u),

˙n = z (z1, n ),

y = z1,

(8.38)

where the invertible coordinates change x = (z1, n ) has been developed; h = D
f1(z1, n ) +
D I1(t), represents an augmented state which lumps the uncertain terms (the ionic channels
activation and inactivation variables for the master and slave systems) contained in D
f1,
n
1. In order to stabilize the
synchronization error system, we consider the nonlinear controller (8.11) and observe that
it can be written in the following (linearizing-like) form

−

u = [h + kz1]

where k
depends on the uncertain state h
(z1,h ) is solved by using a high-gain observer (dynamic compensator) [61],

R+ represents a control gain value. However, since the control law (8.39)
, it is not physically realizable. The problem of estimating

where (ˆz1, ˆh ) are the estimated values of (z1,h ); L0 is the unique tuning parameter, and
represents a high-gain estimation parameter that can be interpreted as the uncertainties
estimation rate. The parameters k 1,2 are chosen for the polynomial P(s) = s2 + k 2s+ k 1 = 0
with all its eigenvalues in the left-half complex plane.

The linearizing control law with uncertainty estimation that, together with the dynamic
compensator (8.40)-(8.41), stabilizes the synchronization error at the origin and, conse-
quently, synchronizes the HH neuronal systems now becomes

u = [ ˆh + kˆz1].

(8.42)

A stability analysis for the closed loop system (8.38), (8.40)-(8.42) is provided in Appendix
B at the end of the chapter. A tuning algorithm for stability and duration time is also
provided in [87]. Thus, controller (8.40)-(8.42) is a general approach to synchronization
of HH neurons despite it lacks knowledge about the states of activation and/or inactivation
of the potassium and sodium ionic channels.

It is pointed out that the modiﬁed feedback control law (8.40)-(8.42) yields Complete
Practical Synchronization [59], i.e., the trajectories of the synchronization error system
converge around the origin within a ball of radius L−

1
0 .

Once obtained the modiﬁed control law, it can be implemented in systems (8.1)-(8.8).
Then, we are led to the following extended system of differential equations that guarantees

8.6 Conclusion of the chapter

In this chapter, we have shown that there exists a nonlinear unidirectional coupling such
that two silent HH neurons attain synchronized states in spite of parametric discrepancies.
Results show that synchronized spiking patterns of the action potentials are displayed by
the unidirectionally coupled system of HH neurons. The synchronization coupling via
the control action (8.11) yields a synaptic-like control current term containing as control
parameter the convergence rate.
Increases on the control parameter have the effect to
allow faster synchronization convergence for the refractory dynamics. Regular spiking
patterns in synchronized state can be achieved for regular-irregular desynchronized spiking
sequences as shown in Fig. 8.1. Because of measurements for the ionic channels activation
and inactivation are not physically realizable, a robust adaptive scheme has been developed
to yield the synchronization dynamics of the HH neurons. A modiﬁed feedback control
law composed of a dynamic compensator and a linearizing control law with uncertainties
estimation has been implemented. The adaptive scheme leads to robust synchronization
dynamical states of the action potentials as shown in Fig. 8.4. The ionic channels activity
is also synchronized. The dynamic compensator allows to reconstruct the dynamics of the
states (z1, h ) from measurements of the action potentials, and it requires only one tuning
parameter, L0. Artiﬁcial devices experimentally implemented in neuronal systems [74]
are elucidating in the unveiling of mechanisms underlying synchronization and control
parameters perform a very important role. The nonlinear control theory could provide
useful methods in studying synchronization phenomena in single neurons and neural
networks, even though natural properties like intrinsic noise and synaptic conductances
must be regarded.

Appendix A: Internal dynamics of the synchronization error system

The synchronization error system (8.12)-(8.15) is already in canonical form. This means
the ﬁrst one, given by Eq.
that the closed-loop system has two subsystems:
(8.12),
(8.13)-(8.15), is not affected by the
is controllable while second one, given by Eqs.
unidirectionally synchronization force u. Hence, to assure asymptotic stability it is
necessary to study the dynamics of subsystem (8.13)-(8.15). If subsystem (8.13)-(8.15)
is (asymptotically) stable at origin, then the closed-loop is said minimum-phase and, as
a consequence, the synchronization force u leads the trajectories of system (8.9) to zero.
Thus, we have that, for any time t > t0
xS and GS via Exact Synchronization is
0, xM
achieved. The zero dynamics can be obtained by setting x1 = 0 [58] and considering the
master system dynamics,

Calculation of a linear approximation for the zero dynamics (A.1) allows to obtain the
corresponding eigenvalues in order to determine the stability of the system. Let ˙xz =

vector ﬁeld. The linear approximation ˙xz = Axz where A is the Jacobian matrix of the

Due to the system (A.1) has all its eigenvalues in the left-half complex plane the internal

Because of the trajectories of the synchronization error system are contained in a chaotic
attractor, the uncertain terms h (t) and G (z1, h , n , u) are bounded functions. Moreover,
the matrix D has all its eigenvalues in the left-half complex plane, consequently, the
dynamics of the estimation error converges asymptotically to zero for any L0 > L∗0 > 0, and
(ˆz1, ˆh )
(z1, h ). Therefore, the closed loop system (8.38), (8.40)-(8.42) is asymptotically

Final conclusion

For the ﬁrst part of this thesis the main original result is an efﬁcient factorization method for
second order ordinary differential equations (ODE) with polynomial nonlinearities. This
method allows us to ﬁnd kink particular solutions for reaction-diffusion (RD) equations and
anharmonic oscillator equations. In addition, application of SUSYQM-type factorization
techniques allows to ﬁnd a pair of travelling wave solutions for different RD equations
with the same wave velocity. The method is also applied to more complicated second order
nonlinear equations with interesting results. We believe that this factorization scheme is
easier and more efﬁcient than other employed methods to ﬁnd exact particular solutions
of second order ODE. Exact solutions have been found for differential equations with
applications in nonlinear physics and biology, for instance, the generalized and convective
Fisher equations, the Dufﬁng-van der Pol oscillator equation and the generalized Burgers-
Huxley equation. An application to the biological dynamics of microtubules (MTs) has
been developed as a byproduct of supersymmetric procedures. Possible interpretation of
our results may be related to the motion of impurities along the MTs or to the structural
discontinuities in the arrangement of tubulin molecules. Another interesting result, in the
context of applications of supersymmetric factorization procedures in physical systems,
is a complex parametric extension of the classical harmonic oscillator. This extension
is based on a SUSYQM procedure that has been previously used for Dirac equation in
relativistic particle physics. This result may have applications in dissipative (absorptive)
processes in physical optics as well as in the physics of cavities. Also, an application to
the chemical physics of diatomic molecules using the same supersymmetric factorization
scheme is included. As a result an exactly solvable nonhermitic quantum Morse problem
is obtained.

In the second part of the thesis it was shown that two noiseless Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)
neurons attain synchronized dynamical states when a feedback action is implemented.
Because there exist uncertain states that cannot be accurately measured in practice (for
instance, the ionic channels activity), a robust approach that guarantees the synchronization
of the HH neurons is implemented. Numerical results describing the synchronized
behavior of the membrane action potentials of the two neurons are displayed.

Abstract

We present the results of the modeling of proton translocation in ﬁnite H-bonded chains in the

framework of two-stage proton transport model. We explore the inﬂuence of reorientation motion

of protons, as well as the eﬀect of electric ﬁeld and proton correlations on system dynamics. An

increase of the reorientation energy results in the transition of proton charge from the surrounding

to the inner water molecules in the chain. Proton migration along the chain in an external electric

ﬁeld has a step-like character, proceeding with the occurrence of electric ﬁeld threshold-type eﬀects

and drastic redistribution of proton charge. Electric ﬁeld applied to correlated chains induces ﬁrst

a formation of ordered dipole structures for lower ﬁeld strength, and than, with a further ﬁeld

strength increase, a stabilization of states with Bjerrum D-defects.

INTRODUCTION

Translocation of protons over long distances has a key importance for biological systems.

It is believed that proton migration along the chains of water molecules formed between

the interior of proteins and the solvent, establishes electrochemical potential gradients play-

ing an important functional role [1]. Experimental evidence indicates that the dominant

mechanism responsible for proton transport in transmembrane proteins (for instance, in

bacteriorhodopsin of Halobacterium halobium [2, 3] and in gramicidin A channels [3, 4]) is

the diﬀusion of H+ ions which is faster than the hydrodynamic ﬂow of hydronium species

(H3O)+. Especially at low hydrogen concentrations in channels, proton conduction is de-

termined by a two-stage Grotthuss-type mechanism [5, 6] shown schematically in Fig. 1(a).

The ﬁrst stage involves the intrabond proton tunnelling along the hydrogen bridge which is

connected with the transfer of ionic positive and negative charged defects. To sustain a ﬂux

of H+ in such proton wire, the inter-molecular proton transfer due to the reorientations of

molecular group with proton is assumed. Reorientation motion leads to the breaking of the

hydrogen bond (so-called orientational Bjerrum L-defect) and location of proton between

another pair of molecular groups. Consequently, reorientation step in the presence of the

second proton may induce high-energy conﬁguration with both of the protons shared by two

adjacent oxygen ions (Bjerrum D-defect). Thus the second stage of transport process involv-

ing a migration of Bjerrum defects is the rate-limiting step for the rapid proton migration

[7].

As was pointed in [5], experimental analysis of proton ﬂow in bioenergetic proteins and

mechanism of proton migration is very diﬃcult because of its intrinsically transient nature.

To shed more light on microscopic nature of proton transport and to analyze inﬂuence of

quantum eﬀects and interaction with proton surrounding, theoretical modeling remains to

be essentially important.

The goal of the present work is to study proton wire containing a ﬁnite number of water

molecules by the use of quantum statistical mechanics methods which are extremely eﬀective

in the description of collective nature of proton transfer and in quantum treatment of light H

nuclei [8]. To describe correctly proton transport process, we employ here two-stage proton

transport model [9] incorporating quantum eﬀects such as proton tunneling and zero-point

vibration energy. In earlier papers [10, 11, 12] we applied two-stage model to analyze eﬀect of

2

coupling between protons and molecular group vibrations on proton conductivity in inﬁnite

H-bonded chains. In particular, it was shown that the proton-lattice vibration interactions

induce structural instabilities and charge ordering in system [10], whereas the Grotthuss-type

transport mechanism manifests itself in nontrivial temperature- and frequency dependences

of proton conductivity [11, 12].

In this work, in order to study proton migration in ﬁnite biological systems, we analyze

the inﬂuence of proton-proton correlations, comparing two diﬀerent protonated chains con-

taining one and two excess protons respectively. We ﬁnd that the reaction of protonation

of water chain is extremely sensitive to the reorientation energy of proton motion. We show

that the increase of reorientation energy results in the drastic decrease of the proton charge

density at the boundary between the chain and surrounding with consequent localization

of protons near the inner water molecules. Moreover, as appeared from our modeling, the

application of external electric ﬁeld induces the step-like threshold-type eﬀects with the

ordering of proton charge and stabilization of Bjerrum D-defects in the wire.

II. MODEL SPECIFICATION AND METHOD OF CALCULATION

To model a proton wire, we consider a linear chain containing N hydrogen bonds and

l = 1, 2, . . . , N, N + 1 molecular groups. The outer left (l = 1) and right (l = N + 1)

molecular complexes mimic the surrounding of the proton wire and diﬀer from the inner

(l = 2, . . . , N) water molecules. The transport of excess proton through the wire proceeds

via the following two steps:

(i) proton can be transferred within a H-bond (process shown by short arrows in Fig. 1(a))

which is modelled by simple two-minimum potential, with corresponding tunneling integral

ΩT :

HT = ΩT

where c+

lν(clν) are the operators of the proton creation(annihilation) in the position (l, ν)
denotes left/right position for proton on the H-bond);

(the index ν =

a, b
}

{

(ii) a water molecule together with covalently bonded hydrogen ion can be rotated, and this

process causes the breaking of the H-bond and location of H+ between two another nearest

between protons in the chain:

Besides the transport process, we incorporate the following two types of interactions

(iii) diﬀerent short-range conﬁgurations of the protons near an inner water molecule as well

as an outer molecular group can appear due to the diﬀerent nature of bonding (shorter

covalent or longer H-bond). The energies of possible conﬁgurations (shown in Fig. 1(b)) are

described by the following terms:

n1a) + ˜w1n1a, HN +1 = ˜εN +1(1

nN b) + ˜wN +1nN b,

The parts H1 and HN +1 describe the energies of the boundary proton conﬁgurations near

the left and the right surrounding molecular groups (we assume for simplicity ˜ε1 = ˜εN +1 = ˜ε

and ˜w1 = ˜wN +1 = ˜w in the boundary conﬁgurations shown in the upper scheme of Fig. 1(b)).

The terms Hl (l = 2, . . . , N) contain the conﬁguration energies for the water molecules in the
wire (the lower part in Fig. 1(b)). Here the proton occupancy operators nlν = c+

(IV) a strong repulsion between two nearest protons shared by two neighboring oxygens (so

called Bjerrum D-defect) with repulsion energy U is represented by the term:

In our following analysis we use the value of U

10 kcal/mol corresponding to the energy

of relaxed D-defect estimated in [13] on the basis of quantum chemical calculations.

To model a ﬁeld exerted by the surrounding, we apply external electric ﬁeld of the strength

E to the proton wire, which is described by the following term

In order to analyze the dynamics of the proton wire embedded in the suddounding under

the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld, as well as the eﬀect of rotational motions of covalent groups with

To calculate exactly the above-mentioned statistical averages, we need to know the quan-

which appear due to the boundary eﬀects, are independent of the proton location in the

when the proton is attracted to the surrounding and needs to overcome the boundary energy

The parameter J = w + w′

2ε describes the eﬀective short-range interaction between

−

protons near the water molecule. Because J includes the two-proton conﬁguration energy w

(see Fig. 1(b)) and the value of w is one-two orders of magnitude higher than the values of
ε and w′ (the later is in agreement with the results obtained in [15]), we set in the following

analysis J

excluding in this way the appearance of these two-proton conﬁgurations in

→ ∞

our system.

Due to the two types of motions we have two diﬀerent contributions to the proton dipole

moment: the orientational part µr = epRr and the transfer part µab = epRab where Rab =

Rlb

Rla denotes the distance H-H between two nearest proton positions of the H-bond.

In our calculations, we use the values µab = 3.5 D and µab = 4.5 D corresponding to the
moderately strong H-bond with O-O distance Rab + 2Rr = 2.6˚A and the covalent O-H bond
with the length Rr = 0.94˚A.

By the similar way the energy (1-5) can be rewritten for the systems with any ﬁnite value

−

of N.

III. CASE STUDY: ONE EXCESS PROTON IN CHAIN

As the starting point, in this section we mimic the situation when one proton is moved

towards the water chain embedded into the solvent. To examine the behavior of the proto-

nated chain with N H-bonds and n = 1 excess proton, we consider H 1 part of the energy

given by (11). Since the zero-point vibration energy for protonated chains is larger than

7

the potential energy barrier for the proton transfer between two shared oxygens [17], the

quantum tunneling is not required for intra-bond H+ transfer. Thus, in our modelling we

set ΩT

≈

0. With this assumption, the energy levels of H 1 can be found exactly:

To analyze the role of ΩR we consider ﬁrst the case without external ﬁeld (E = 0).

Depending on the value of ΩR, two diﬀerent regimes may be stabilized in the system. In

the ﬁrst small-ΩR regime, the two lowest energy levels λ1,2 correspond to the superposition

of the two boundary states

with the proton located in the surrounding near the left or the right outer molecular groups.

reﬂects the transition of the proton from the surrounding to the states where the proton

is shared by the chain water molecules, which corresponds to the protonation chemical

reaction. Fig. 2 shows the variation of the average occupancies of proton sites with ΩR for
the chains with N = 2 and N = 3 H-bonds. At ΩR = Ω∗

results reported in [16, 17] showing that in H-bonded ﬁnite chains, the excess charge is best

solvated by the central H-bonds. Moreover, as follows from our results, to overcome the

barrier between the surrounding and the wire, the reorientation energy should be suﬃciently

large (ΩR >

∆) in order to stabilize the inner proton conﬁgurations.

We turn now to an analysis of the proton translocation directed by the external ﬁeld (the

case E

= 0). Fig. 3 shows the ﬁeld-dependences of P and

for the chain containing

N = 2 H-bonds. We note that the behavior in the ﬁrst small-and in the second large-ΩR

regime diﬀers drastically. In the small-ΩR regime the polarization increases smoothly with

E approaching ﬁnally its maximal saturation value Pmax = µr + µab (Fig. 3(a), inset). In

contrast to this, in the large-ΩR regime the ﬁeld dependence is rather nontrivial: ﬁrst for

E < Ethresh P changes very slowly, and than at E

Ethresh a strong increase of P to

∼

P = Pmax is observed in Fig. 3(a). This rapid step-like change of the proton polarization

reﬂects the threshold-type eﬀect with the threshold electric ﬁeld value

with N = 2 as can be observed in Fig. 3(a)). As we see in Fig. 3(b), the proton charge

translocation under the inﬂuence of ﬁeld in this case proceeds not smoothly, but has a

step-like character. As results from (18), the threshold value Ethresh (which is needed to

overcome a barrier for pumping between the inner localized states (17) and the boundary

state

00 . . . 01

in the direction of ﬁeld) increases for larger ΩR (Fig. 3(a), the cases with

|

i

ΩR = 1.5 kcal/mol and ΩR = 2.15 kcal/mol). Since the reorientation energy ΩR depends on

the number of water molecules in the chain [5], increasing for longer chains, the successive

translocation of the excess proton in the wire under the inﬂuence of E should occur at the

higher ﬁeld values. This means, that the conductivity of protonated chains should drop with

the increasing chain length, which is in agreement with the conclusion reported in [5].

IV. ROLE OF PROTON-PROTON CORRELATIONS

In order to examine the inﬂuence of proton correlations, we consider the translocation of

two excess protons in the wire which is described by the part H 2 of the total energy (11).

Since the presence of two protons in wire may lead to the formation of Bjerrum D-defect,

the energy H 2 for the chain with N = 2 H-bonds given by the expression (13), contains the

terms with the energy U of the repulsion between two nearest-neighboring protons.

Analogously to the 1-proton wire, we analyze ﬁrst the behavior of the chain without the

electric ﬁeld. For N = 2 and ΩT

0 the energy levels found from (13) have the following

external electric ﬁeld has a step-like character proceeding via the threshold mechanism. In

the large-ΩR regime, where the protons are stabilized at the inner water molecules already

at E = 0, the ﬁrst threshold phenomenon at E = E1, observed for the small-ΩR case, does

not occur. However, the threshold transition at E = E2 with the formation of D-defect

appears in this regime similarly to the regime of small ΩR, that can be observed in P -proﬁle

for ΩR = 3 kcal/mol shown in Fig. 5(a).

V. SUMMARY

In this work we studied the process of proton translocation in 1D-chains mimicking pro-

tonated water channels embedded in surrounding. We have analyzed the role of the reorien-

tation motion of protons, as well as the eﬀect of electric ﬁeld and proton correlations on the

chain dynamics. We have shown that the increase of the reorientation energy results in the

transition to the large-ΩR regime characterized by the transfer of the proton charge from the

surrounding to the inner water molecules in the chain. The process of proton migration along

the chain in the external electric ﬁeld has the step-like character leading to the appearance

of the electric ﬁeld threshold-type phenomena with drastic redistribution of proton charge.

The correlations between protons in the chain increase the ”critical” reorientation energy

necessary for the transition into the large-ΩR regime. The electric ﬁeld applied to correlated

chains induces ﬁrst the formation of ordered dipole structures for the lower E values, and

than, with the further E increase, the stabilization of states with Bjerrum D-defects.

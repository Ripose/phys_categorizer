Abstract

In this letter we present the results of a simple model for intercellular com-

munication via calcium oscillations, motivated in part by a recent experimental

study. The model describes two cells (a ”donor” and ”sensor”) whose intra-

cellular dynamics involve a calcium-induced, calcium release process. The cells

are coupled by assuming that the the input of the sensor cell is proportional

to the output of the donor cell. As one varies the frequency of calcium oscilla-

tions of the donor cell, the sensor cell passes through a sequence of N:M phase

locked regimes and exhibits a ”Devil’s staircase” behavior. Such a phase locked

response has been seen experimentally in pulsatile stimulation of single cells.

We also study a stochastic version of the coupled two cell model. We ﬁnd that

phase locking holds for realistic choices for the cell volume.

Oscillatory increases in the intracellular concentration of calcium control a variety

of important, diverse biological functions, including muscle contraction, metabolism

and gene expression [1, 2, 3]. In the latter case, for example, calcium oscillations lead

to the expression of genes that are essential for dendritic development and neuronal

survival. A recent review of the versatility and universality of calcium signalling has

been given by Berridge et al [1]. Typically cells have a Ca2+ rest concentration of

about 100 nM, but when activated rise to concentrations of roughly ten times this.

Such increases can be produced by ligands (agonists) binding to receptors located

on the plasma membrane, through a process involving the second messenger inositol-

1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). These can be receptor-speciﬁc, as shown in a recent study

of the relationship between the production of IP3 and the calcium response [4]. An

important characteristic of the spike-like Ca2+ oscillations is that they are frequency,

rather than amplitude, encoded. That is, an increase in the agonist concentration

increases the frequency of oscillation, but has little eﬀect on its amplitude. Another

signiﬁcant characteristic is that calcium signals can be propagated between cells, pro-

viding an important means of cell communication. Such intercellular communication

can take diﬀerent forms, including diﬀusion of calcium or IP3 through gap junctions

and paracrine signaling. Recently deterministic models have been developed for sig-

nalling through gap-junction diﬀusion, via a second messenger such as calcium or IP3

[5, 6, 7].

Important stochastic eﬀects have also been included [8] for gap-junction

signalling, as well as for other aspects of calcium dynamics [9, 10, 11]. In one type

of paracrine signalling, a calcium spike in one cell causes the release of a secondary

agonist, such as ATP, to the extracellular space, followed by stimulation of purinergic

receptors on nearby cells [12, 13]. Recently a new paracrine mechanism for inter-

cellular communication has been proposed [14], based on the fact that the calcium

liberated as a consequence of intracellular calcium spiking is often extruded to the

extracellular neighborhood of the cell. The recent experimental study showed if this

space is limited such that the local extracellular calcium ﬂuctuations are suﬃciently

large, calcium-sensing receptors (CaR) [15] on the surfaces of adjacent cells can be

activated, producing secondary spikes in these cells. Thus calcium receptors may

2

mediate a new form of intercellular communication in which cells are informed of the

intracellular signaling of their neighbors via extracellular calcium ﬂuctuations. How-

ever, the experimental results yield only qualitative information about the response

of the sensor cell to the donor cell.

In this letter we present the results of a simple model for paracrine intercellular com-

munication via calcium oscillations, motivated in part by this recent experimental

study. As one still does not understand in detail the complex biochemistry involved

in the CaR coupling, we limit ourselves to studying a simpliﬁed model that might

capture the qualitative features of this new form of signaling. There are two as-

pects to describing the intercellular communication: the intracellular dynamics and

the coupling between cells. A number of theoretical models have been developed to

explain intracellular Ca oscillations [16, 17, 18, 19]. The basis for most of these is

that after an agonist (hormone) binds to the extracellular side of a receptor bound

to the membrane, the Gα subunit at the intracellular side of the receptor-coupled

G-protein is activated. This activated G-protein then stimulates a phospholipase C

(PLC) which helps form a second messenger IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 then binds

to speciﬁc receptors in the membrane of an internal store of calcium (such as the

endoplasmic reticulum). The binding helps open calcium channels, which leads to a

large ﬂux of calcium ions from the internal store into the cytosol, which then stim-

ulates the release of additional calcium ions. Some details of this complex progress,

however, remain unknown.

As there are many diﬀerent models for the intracellular calcium oscillations, we choose

the simplest to illustrate how the results of communication between cells might diﬀer

depending on the internal cell dynamics. This is the so-called minimal model, involv-

ing two dynamical variables, the cytosolic calcium and an internal store of calcium

(such as the endoplasmic reticulum) respectively [16], in which an agonist induces

calcium oscillations in a single cell. We couple two such cells, the donor cell and the

sensor cell, by assuming that the stimulus of the target cell is proportional to the

cytosolic calcium content of the ﬁrst cell. Since some of the cytosolic Ca2+ produced

3

in the donor cell is extruded into a small space near a CaR receptor, this seems to be

a reasonable assumption. This avoids modeling the extracellular diﬀusion of Ca2+ as

well as the complex receptor dynamics that is presumably involved in the calcium-

sensing receptor mechanism proposed by H¨ofer et al.

[14]. However, our model is

consistent with the spirit of the single cell minimal model in that it provides a mini-

mal two cell coupling that yields interesting intercellular communication. We should

also note that under in vivo conditions, hormones are not released steadily, but are

released in a pulsatile fashion. Thus our results for the sensor cell responding to an

input signal are in principle relevant to the physiologically interesting question of how

the intracellular cytosolic calcium responds to a pulsatile application of agonists.

We consider a coupled cell version of the minimal model, coupling two cells through

a term proportional to the calcium output of the ﬁrst (donor) cell. This term will

serve as an external stimulus for the second (sensor) cell. The donor cell dynamics

is described by two diﬀerential equations for its cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, y1 and

its internal store of Ca2+, y2:

dy1

oscillations will occur when the parameter β1, which increases with the concentration

of the external hormonal stimulus, lies in a range βmin < β1 < βmax. The minimum

and maximum values depend mainly on the parameters V0 and V1.

The sensor cell is modeled using the same equations for its cytosolic and internal

calcium concentrations y

1 and y

2 as given in Eqs(1,2). However, instead of a term

4

coupling between the cells. This assumes that the stimulus to the donor cell from

the extruded calcium from the donor cell is proportional to the the latter’s cytosolic

calcium concentration. In general, the structural parameters V0, V1, V2, V3, kf , k of
f , k′ of the second cell can be diﬀerent, but for the
the ﬁrst cell and V ′
sake of simplicity we take them to be the same. We ﬁnd in general that oscillations

3, k′

in the donor cell due to a constant hormonal input produce oscillations in the sensor

cell. This is in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation [14], but the

detailed predictions of our model require further experimental study.

We have calculated the N:M rhythms predicted for this coupled minimal model as

a function of β1 for ﬁxed β2, where N denotes the number of stimuli arising from

the donor cell and M the number of responses of the sensor cell in a given time in-

terval. For example, the frequency of response can be the same as the frequency of

the stimulus, i.e. N:M is 1:1. However, in general the Ca2+ response in the sensor

cell is blocked when the frequency of pulses of the donor cell is increased. In Fig. 1

we show a 3:2 response. This phenomenon of blocking is also seen in heart patients,

where it is known as Wencekbach periodicity. As one varies β1 the sensor cell passes

through a sequence of N:M phase locked regimes (in response to the oscillatory stimuli

from the donor cell) and exhibits a ”Devil’s staircase” behavior [20], as shown in Fig.

2. That is, between any two steps there is a countless number of staircases. This

behavior has been found earlier in a study of a ﬁnite diﬀerence model of cardiac ar-

rhythmias [21] as well as in a model of intracellular calcium oscillations [18] in which

the hormonal stimulus was modeled by a sequence of square well pulses. However,

this is the ﬁrst prediction of such behavior in coupled, nonexcitable cells. We ﬁnd,
for example, that with k = 6s−1, k′ = 6s−1, β2 = 0.4 and all other parameters as in

Table 1 the variation of β1 from 0.3 to 0.415, i.e. increase in the concentration of the

external stimulus which increases the frequency output of the ﬁrst cell, leads to the

ratio of the stimulus/response from 1:1 rhythm (β1 = 0.3), through 5:4 (β1 = 0.4),

4:3 (β1 = 0.405), 3:2 (β1 = 0.41), 5:3 (β1 = 0.412) to the 2:1 rhythm (β1=0.415). On

the other hand, various rhythms also can be obtained by ﬁxing, for example, β1 = 0.3

and varying β2 from 0.38 to 0.345 (all other parameters as described above). In this

5

case we ﬁnd the following sequence of the stimulus/response rhythms: 1:1 rhythm

(β2 = 0.38), 5:4 (β2 = 0.37), 4:3 (β2 = 0.365), 3:2 (β2 = 0.36) and ﬁnally a 2:1

rhythm (β2=0.345). Some examples of the Devil’s staircase are shown in Fig. 2 and

Fig. 3. This response of the sensor cell is similar to experimental results of Sch¨oﬂ

et al.

[22] who applied square wave pulses to phenylephrine to liver cells every 30

seconds. They found stimulus/response rhythms such as 2:1, but with less regularity

than shown here [23]. A subsequent stochastic model based on a deterministic model

of intracellular dynamics due to Chay et al [18] yielded results qualitatively similar

to the experiment [23].

Deterministic models such as the one used above neglect potentially important stochas-

tic eﬀects such as ﬂuctuations in the baseline values of Ca2+ and variations in the

amplitudes and widths of the spikes. Since the number densities of the intracellular
signaling molecules are typically low (of the order of 1 − 102µm−3, stochastic eﬀects

could be important. To see whether such eﬀects are signiﬁcant here, we have also

studied a stochastic version of our model, using a Monte Carlo method due to Gille-

spie [24]. We have studied the stochastic model for diﬀerent values of the cell volume

Ω (assumed to be the same for both cells). For very small Ω ﬂuctuations destroy the

phase locking, while in the limit of large Ω one recovers the deterministic limit. Both

results are what one would expect. For intermediate values of Ω, however, such as

Ω = 2000, which is the approximate volume of hepatocyte cells, we ﬁnd that phase

locking persists, although with occasional lapses. Some typical results for this case

are shown in Fig. 4. Thus we ﬁnd a stochastic version of the Devil’s staircase for val-

ues of the cell volume that are realistic. We also found that cells can switch between

frequencies in the stochastic model if we choose β1 and β2 such that the deterministic

model would give a frequency locking of the cells on the edge of one of the steps of

the Devil’s staircase.

In conclusion, we have shown that a coupled minimalist model can account for a

variety of calcium oscillations that have been seen experimentally in hepatocytes

stimulated with time-dependent pulses of hormone [22]. This simple model can also

describe intercellular communication between cells via calcium-sensing receptors, with

6

results that are at least qualitatively consistent with a recent experimental study [14]

We have found in addition that the deterministic version of the model yields a Devil’s

staircase type of phase locking between the donor and sensor cell. We have also

found that this phase locking is present in a stochastic version of this model, which

is a novel feature of the study. The stochastic model is more realistic than the deter-

ministic model and yields baseline ﬂuctuations and variations in the amplitude of the

spikes in Ca2+, as seen in experimental studies of calcium oscillations. Whether or

not paracrine communication in real biological systems will exhibit a Devil’s staircase

behavior is an open question, however, as there are many ways in which one should

improve our model to make it more realistic. For example, we are currently extending

this study to include the plasma membrane receptor dynamics [25], and oscillations

in IP3 that have been seen in some recent studies [26, 27, 4]. Our preliminary results

from a study of two cells whose internal dynamics is given by a model of Kummer

et al [19] with coupling through receptor dynamics similar to that of Riccobene et al

[25] show that bursting behavior, in addition to the type of behavior reported here, is

also possible for this form of paracrine communication. The fundamental problem of

paracrine cell communication would seem to be a rich ﬁeld for further experimental

and theoretical investigation.

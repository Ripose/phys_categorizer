The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) has been used for simulating various biological phenomena such
as diﬀerential adhesion, fruiting body formation of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, angio-
genesis, cancer invasion, chondrogenesis in embryonic vertebrate limbs, and many others. In this
paper, we derive continuous limit of discrete one dimensional CPM with the chemotactic interac-
tions between cells in the form of a Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the cell probability
density function. This equation is then reduced to the classical macroscopic Keller-Segel model.
In particular, all coeﬃcients of the Keller-Segel model are obtained from parameters of the CPM.
Theoretical results are veriﬁed numerically by comparing Monte Carlo simulations for the CPM
with numerics for the Keller-Segel model.

INTRODUCTION

Biological cell dynamics has been studied at two main scales of description. The macroscopic level provides one
with a coarse-grained treatment of biological cells through their macroscopically averaged quantities such as local
density of cells [1, 2, 3, 4]. The macroscopic scale is large in comparison with the typical size of a cell. Macroscopic
models are usually continuous and utilize families of diﬀerential or integro-diﬀerential equations to describe “ﬁelds”
of interaction. A much more detailed approach is needed at the second, microscopic level which takes into account
stochastic ﬂuctuations of the shape of each individual cell.

Discrete models describe individual (microscopic) behaviors of cells. They are often applied to microscale events
where a small number of elements can have a large (and stochastic) impact on a system. For example, while many
periodic growth patterns can be modeled using continuous methods, patterns which depend sensitively on interaction
between cells and substrate are best modeled with discrete methods. Simplest discrete models describe cells as point-
wise objects. Some bacteria are self-propelled and do not change considerably their shape during motion (e.g. E.
Coli [2, 5] and M. xanthus [6, 7] bacteria). They can be successfully represented as point-wise objects undergoing
reorientation while moving [2, 8, 9]. In contrast, some other bacteria (e.g. Dictyostelium discoideum [10]) experience
essential random ﬂuctuations of their shapes and need to be treated as extended objects of variable shapes.

One of the microscopic models dealing with diﬀerential adhesion and shape ﬂuctuations is a Cellular Potts Model
(CPM) which is an extension of the well known Potts Model from statistical mechanics [11, 12]. In this model each
biological cell is represented by a cluster of pixels (spins). The CPM has been used to simulate various biological
phenomena such as cell sorting [11, 12], fruiting body formation of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum [13, 14],
angiogenesis [15], cancer invasion [16], chondrogenesis in embryonic vertebrate limbs [17, 18], and many others.
(Diﬀerent applications of the CPM have been reviewed in [19].) Recently a new alternative model was suggested [20]
which represents a cell as collection of subcellular elements which interact with each other through phenomenological
intra- and intercellular potentials.

In addition to short range cell-cell adhesion and interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix
(haptotaxis), cell interact at long range through signal transmission and reception mediated by a diﬀusing chemical
ﬁeld (chemotaxis). Continuous macroscopic Keller-Segel model of the evolution of the density of cells with chemotactic
interactions have been extensively studied [1, 2, 3, 4] over the years. In particular, it has been successfully applied
to the description of Escherichia coli bacteria aggregation due to chemotaxis in [2]. The drawback of continuous
models is that they have a lower resolution than discrete models. However, their advantage is the availability of a
large set of analytical and numerical tools for analyzing solutions of the corresponding nonlinear partial diﬀerential

equations (PDEs). By contrast, the analytical study of discrete models is often impossibly complicated, and their
computational implementation is often much less eﬃcient in comparison with numerical methods available for PDEs.
It is thus important, for numerical, analytical, as well as conceptual reasons to establish connections between various
discrete and continuous models of the same biological problem.

There is a vast literature on studying continuous limits of point-wise discrete microscopic models. In particular,
classical Keller-Segel model has been derived from a model with point-wise representation for cells undergoing random
walk [8, 21, 22]. However, much less work has been done on deriving macroscopic limits of microscopic models which
treat cells as extended objects. One of the ﬁrst attempts at combining microscopic and macroscopic levels of description
of cellular dynamics has been described in [23] where the diﬀusion coeﬃcient for a collection of noninteracting randomly
moving cells has been derived from a one dimensional CPM. Recently a microscopic limit of subcellular elements model
[20] was derived in the form of continuous advection-diﬀusion equation for cellular density. In the present paper, we
establish a connection between a one-dimensional CPM of a cell moving on a substrate and reacting to a chemical
ﬁeld, and a Fokker-Planck equation for the cell probability density function. This equation is then reduced to the
classical macroscopic Keller-Segel equation. In particular, we derive all coeﬃcients of the Keller-Segel model from
parameters of the CPM. We also compare Monte Carlo simulations for the CPM with numerics for the Keller-Segel
model to support our theoretical results.

Uniﬁed multiscale approach, described in this paper and based on combining microscopic and macroscopic models,
can be applied to studying such biological phenomena as streaming in Dictyostelium discoideum. In starved pop-
ulations of Dictyostelium amoebae, cells produce and detect a communication chemical (cAMP). The movement of
Dictyostelium cells changes from a random walk to a directed walk up the cAMP gradient resulting in formation of
streams of cells towards the aggregation center (see Fig. 1a) and subsequent formation of multi-cellular fruiting body.
Figure 1b shows cells’ movement from left to right in response to waves of cAMP travelling through the aggregation
stream from right to left. The cAMP gradient on the up-down direction is very small and could be ignored. Figure 1c
schematically demonstrates the main features of the cell movement. Unlike diﬀerential adhesion [11, 12], chemotactic
cell motion is highly organized over a length scale signiﬁcantly larger than the size of a single cell. (For details about
modeling Dictyostelium discoideum fruiting body formation see e.g. [13, 14, 24, 25]).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we describe a one dimensional CPM with chemotaxis. In Section
III, we derive from the Monte Carlo dynamics of the CPM the discrete master equation for the probability density
function P (x, L, t); that is, the probability that at time t, there is a cell whose length is L and whose center of mass is
located at x. In Section IV we use the discrete master equation to derive a partial diﬀerential equation for P (x, L, t)
in a continuous limit which assumes that cell changes its position and length at each Monte Carlo step by a small
amount. We show that the dependence of P (x, L, t) on L is very close to the Boltzmann distribution. This is used in
Section V for the derivation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density function p(x, t) of a cell’s center of
mass being at x which is the main result of the paper. In Section VI it is shown that addition of the time dependence
of chemical ﬁeld reduces the Fokker-Planck equation to the Keller-Segel equations. Section VII deals with numerical
veriﬁcation of the theoretical results of the previous sections and compares the Monte Carlo simulations for our CPM
and Keller-Segel models.

II. THE CELLULAR POTTS MODEL

The Cellular Potts Model (CPM), an extension of the Potts Model from statistical mechanics, is a ﬂexible and
powerful way to model cellular patterns. Its core mechanism is the competition between the minimization of various
energy terms in some generalized functional of the cellular conﬁguration, e.g., surface minimization, cell-cell contact
and chemotactic interactions, and global geometric constraints. It simulates stochastic ﬂuctuations of cell shapes as
simple thermal ﬂuctuations.

L

The CPM is deﬁned on a rectangular lattice

, which is of the form [0, mx] (for 1 dimension), [0, mx]

2 dimensions) or [0, mx]
called the lattice sites (intervals in 1D, pixels in 2D, voxels in 3D). A lattice site is denoted by a index i

[0, mz] (for 3 dimensions). (Here [0, m] =

0, 1, . . . , m

[0, my]

.) The elements of

×

×

{

L

Each lattice site has an assigned “spin” σ(i) which can have values s = 0, 1, . . . , Q, where s = 0 corresponds to
Q means that the given site is occupied by the sth cell,
absence of any cell at the given site and the value 1
≤
where Q is the total number of cell in the system. Assume that we ﬁx the values of σ(i) at each lattice site, then we
refer to that set of values as a conﬁguration. The best way to visualize a conﬁguration is to regard the diﬀerent spins
as diﬀerent colors. Each lattice site i has a color σ(i). The cells are the collections of lattice sites that have the same
spin (color), so that each lattice site can be occupied by a single cell only. White color correspond to absence of any
cell at given site: σ(i) = 0. In the model considered here we assume that cells cannot divide so that sites with the
same color are always connected.

concentration of the chemical ﬁeld is shown schematically above the main ﬁgure.

ix = mx + 1, iy = my + 1 and iz = mz + 1, respectively.

The temporal dynamics of the system is deﬁned by certain probabilistic transition rules between the conﬁgurations,
giving rise to a Markov chain of conﬁgurations, i.e. a sequence of conﬁgurations σ0, σ1, σ2, .... To describe the
transition rules, we associate to each conﬁguration σ an energy E(σ), also referred to as the Hamiltonian. The
state changes from one conﬁguration to the next are governed by an energy minimization principle with eﬀective
temperature T. This is implemented by means of the Metropolis algorithm for Monte-Carlo Boltzmann dynamics.
The algorithm works as follows:

Given a conﬁguration σn, we randomly select a lattice site i

such that not all of its nearest lattice neighbors
= σn(i). Let σ′ be the conﬁguration
have the same spin. We then randomly choose a lattice neighbor i′ of i with σn(i′)
we obtain by “ﬂipping” the spin of i, i.e. we have σ′(j) = σn(j) for all j
= i, and σ′(i) = σn(i′). The new conﬁguration
σn+1 is then either σn or the conﬁguration σ′. The probability Φ(∆E) that σ′ is accepted as the next conﬁguration
σn+1 depends on the energy diﬀerence ∆E = E(σ′)

E(σn). The formula is

2 )ε∆x (see Figure 2.)

In what follows, we will consider the dynamics of a single cell so that the spin σ can take two values: 0 if cell is
absent at a given site and 1 if cell occupies a given site. However, our results remain valid for an ensemble of n cells
which are well separated from each other, so that the probability that two cells would try to occupy the same volume
is negligible. This allows us to neglect cell-cell contact interactions. We assume that cells can interact only with the
substrate (haptotaxis) and the chemical ﬁeld c(x) (chemotaxis). The chemical ﬁeld is assumed to depends only on x
but not on y. Cells can also produce a chemical which then diﬀuses. In Section VI we discuss production of chemicals
by cells.

A natural biological realization of this quasi-one-dimensional model is the motion of biological cells in streams[25].
E.g. the amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum under starving condition typically forms streams[24]. The biological cells
inside each stream are moving towards the aggregation center (see Fig. 1a), which results in complicated 2D patterns
[25]. If we zoom to a small scale, we will see that the motion of cells inside each stream is quasi-one-dimensional
with cells moving parallel to each other in x
direction ( Fig. 1b). The chemical gradient of the other direction (y
direction) could be neglected and during cells movement there is no cell-cell interactions, such as cell collisions or cell
signaling. Fig. 1c schematically shows such a parallel motion of the cells from left to the right under the action of
the gradient of a chemical ﬁeld (chemo-attractant).

−

For a given conﬁguration σ of spins, let N = N (σ) denote the number of lattice sites that the cell occupies. The
length of the cell is equal to L = N ε∆x. We denote the position of the center of mass of the cell by x and denote the
position of the left and right ends of the cell by xl and xr, respectively. Then L = xr −
time step of a Monte Carlo algorithm. Then the Hamiltonian is given by the formula:

We assume that the chemical ﬁeld c(x) is a slow function of time so its typical time scale is much bigger than the

xl. (See Figure 2.)

E = Jcm ·

(2L + 2ℓy) + λ (L

LT )2 + µ c(x) L.

−

The ﬁrst term is a surface energy term which corresponds to the cell-substrate interaction energy (haptotaxis), where
Jcm is an interaction energy between the cell and the medium per unit length. The second term is a length-constraint
term which penalizes deviations of the cell length L from the target cell length LT . Here λ is a positive constant.
The choice of λ and β is determined by the typical scale of ﬂuctiuations of the cellular shape. The third term in (2) is
the coupling chemical energy. This term will favor cell motion down or up the chemical gradient for µ > 0 and µ < 0,
respectively. We assume that the concentration c(x) is a slow function of x on a scale of the typical cell’s length L :

xc/L

1,

≫

where xc is a typical scale for variation of c(x) in x. This is consistent with the generally accepted view that cells are
typically too small to detect chemical gradients without moving. (See e.g. [27]; however recent experimental evidence
may put this view in question [28].) Note that the chemical energy could also be deﬁned as µ
c(x)dx. But in the
limit (3), this is equivalent to the form used in the Hamiltonian (2).

III. DISCRETE EVOLUTION EQUATION FOR PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION

In this section, we develop an analytical model for the evolution of the stochastic dynamics of a cell in CPM.
Let P (x, L, t) be a probability density for the cell with the center of mass at x of length L at time t. Spins σ(i)
so that the length of the cell L, which is the diﬀerence between positions of right and left

which is independent of the scaling parameter ε. We now switch from measuring time in Monte Carlo steps n = 0, 1, . . .,
to a continuous time variable t = n ε2 ∆t.

Suppose at time t the cell is at a state (x, L) meaning that it has length L and its center of mass is at x. The

stochastic discrete system at time t + ε2

t can switch to one of the following four possible states:

Θ(

not expand the function itself but only its argument instead. There is an important simpliﬁcation which comes from

We have solved both the master equation (4) and its continuous limit (7) numerically with initial conditions
P (x, L, 0) diﬀerent from the Boltzmann distribution (4). Simulations described in Section VII demonstrate that for
each x, the solution P (x, L, t) indeed converges in time to the Boltzmann distribution at an exponential rate of

8Dβλ.

The probability density function p(x, t) corresponds to the microscopic density in the Keller-Segel model. Notice that
both in the Keller-Segel model and CPM considered in this paper, there is no direct interaction between cells except
through production and reaction to a chemoattractant. In other words, cells are treated in a way similar to a dilute
gas with long range nonlocal interactions due to reaction to a chemical ﬁeld.

VII. COMPARISON OF NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In this section, we describe numerical tests comparing Monte Carlo simulations of the CPM and simulations of both
discrete and continuous models for the probability density functions P (x, L, t) and p(x, t), as given by Eqs. (4), (7)
and (19).

A. Monte Carlo simulations

The computation of the frequency distribution of the cell center of mass and length for the CPM has been carried

out as follows:

1. We run a large number N of CPM simulations with one cell with the same initial conditions.

2. We ﬁx a time interval δt = ε2

t, i.e. we ﬁx the time interval between successive Monte Carlo steps. For each
simulation we record the locations of the center of mass and and lengths of the cell at the times t = δt, 2δt, 3δt, . . .

△

3. After the N runs, the recorded data give a frequency distribution M (x, L, t) for the location of the center of

mass of the cell and length of the cell.

The frequency distribution M (x, L, t) determines the approximation Pcpm(x, L, t) = M (x, L, t)/(N (ε

x)2) of the
probability density function P (x, L, t) for the center of mass of a cell of length L being at x at time t. Therefore,
we compare Pcpm(x, L, t) with P (x, L, t) which is a solution of either the master equation (4) or the Fokker-Planck
equation (7). To approximate the probability density function of center of mass p(x, t) we sum up over all values of
L on the grid in a way used in Eq. (18)

The size of the CPM lattice is chosen to be Lcpm = 100; and the model is typically run from t0 = 0 to tend = 200. The
number of the CPM lattice sites and the number of Monte Carlo steps are chosen to be Lcpm
ε2∆t respectively.
We use a range of values of ε between 0.2 and 0.001.

ε∆x and tend

The initial conditions for each CPM run are chosen as follows. A random pixel in the interval [40, 60] is selected as
a center of mass of a cell, and then the length L for the cell is chosen with probability Z
E(LT )). Here
the normalization constant Zl is chosen to have the total probability 1. In most simulations, we use the following
distribution for the chemical ﬁeld c(x):

B. Monte Carlo simulations versus numerical solutions of the discrete master equation and the
Fokker-Planck equations

We ﬁrst compare Monte Carlo simulations with the numerics for the master equation (4) and the Fokker-Planck
equation (7). Simulations of the Fokker-Planck equation (7) have been performed by using a ﬁnite-diﬀerences scheme.
Figure 3 shows the probability density functions for all three types of simulations. The diﬀerence between the master
equation (4) and the Fokker-Planck equation (7) simulations is negligibly small for ε = 0.01 (Fig. 3a) but can be
, the Monte Carlo simulations converge to the solution
clearly seen for ε = 0.1 (Fig. 3b). We conclude that for N
of the master equation (4) for any ε. The rate of convergence is about N −1/2. For small ε
0, the solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation (7) also converges to the solution of the master equation.

→

C. Convergence of the probability density function P (x, L, t) to the Boltzmann distribution

To demonstrate quick convergence of P (x, L, t) to the Boltzmann distribution (8) (as discussed in Section IV)
we solve numerically both the master equation (4) and its continuous limit (7) with initial conditions P (x, L, 0)
being diﬀerent from the Boltzmann distribution (4). Namely, we choose initial value P (x, L, 0) to be the Bolzmann
distribution with diﬀerent temperature βini = 1.5 so that Figure 4 shows convergence of initial state with temperature
1/βini to the quasi-equilibrium state with temperature 1/β = 1/15 used in the Monte Carlo algorithm. Linear-log plot
in the Figure 4 indicates that convergence is indeed exponential in time with high convergence rate τ −1
r = 98.55
for parameters of Fig. 4). By high convergence rate we mean that the typical convergence time τr is small compare
with e.g. the diﬀusion time x2
0/D in x (see Eq. (7)). Because of the x-dependence of the chemical ﬁeld, the convergence
rate τr is also x-dependent and a closed analytic expression for it is diﬃcult to obtain from Eq. (7) for general c(x).
However even a simple estimate τ −1
r = 8Dβλ of the rate of convergence gives 60 for parameters of Figure 4 which is
qualitatively close to numerical value 98.55. Here 98.55 is obtained from the linear ﬁt presented in Figure 4.

(τ −1

r

Also, we observe that if we increase temperature T in Monte Carlo simulations, so that condition (14) is not true
any more, then it results in a signiﬁcant departure from the Boltzmann distribution (8) which conﬁrms the theoretical
results of Section IV.

D. P (x, L, t) vs. p(x, t) simulations

The ansatz (8) can be used for fast simulations of solutions of the discrete master equation. Summing up over all
values of L in the master Eq. (4) and taking into account (8) result in a discrete equation for the probability density
function p(x, t)

where T (x; x′, t) is a transition probability of a change of position of a center mass from x′ to x at time t. Expressions
for T (x; x′, t) are described in the Appendix. They are calculated only once at the beginning of a simulation which
makes the numerics for discrete Eq. (27) very eﬃcient.

We run simulations for the discrete equation (27) and the continuous Eq. (19) and compared them with the solutions
of the discrete (4) and continuous (7) equations, respectively. We ﬁnd, taking into accout Eq. (8), that indeed the
diﬀerences between these solutions are very small for the typical values of parameters.

of the discrete Eq. (27) for any ε.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we combine microscopic and macroscopic levels of description of one dimensional cellular dynamics.
The microscopic level is represented by a one dimensional CPM with chemotaxis and without cell-cell adhesion
term. We study a continuous macroscopic limit of our CPM as the size of Monte-Carlo step is made small under
the assumption that changes in the cell’s position and length are also small. In this limit, we derive the Fokker-
Planck equation (19) for the probability density function p(x, t) of cells and then further reduce it to the well-known
macroscopic continuous Keller-Segel model (20) and (23) for the chemotactic aggregation of cells. All coeﬃcients of
the Keller-Segel model are derived from parameters of the CPM.

We use numerical simulations to test hierarchy of models and assumptions which we used to derive continuous
equation (19).
In particular, we compare Monte Carlo simulations with simulations of both the discrete master
equation (4) and the Fokker-Planck equation (7) for P (x, L, t). We ﬁnd that, as expected from our theoretical
analysis, all models agree for small ε. Also Monte Carlo simulations agree with the solutions of the discrete master
equation (4) for arbitrary ε. We verify numerically that the probability density function P (x, L, t) quickly converges
to the Boltzmann distribution (8). And ﬁnally, we ﬁnd that numerical simulations show excellent agreement between
Monte Carlo simulations of CPM and the continuous macroscopic model (19).

We are currently working on extending our results to a 2D case for modeling chondrogenic patterning in the presence

of chemotaxis and ﬁbronactin production [29].

This x-dependence is eliminated after going from a discrete summation in (12) to an integral (as in Eq. (13)). We
evaluate the transitional probabilities T (x; x
x, t) numerically using (28) for each value of x
x, t) and T (x

once at the beginning of each simulation and then calculate the discrete evolution of Eq. (27).

Notice that in the limit of small ε

0, the continuous equation (19) can be derived directly from (12), (27) and
(28). However, this derivation is more tedious compared with the two-step derivation in Sections IV and V where
continuous equation (7) is ﬁrst derived and then integrated (7) over L which results in Eq. (19).

Abstract

The source term in a reaction-diﬀusion system, in general, does not involve

explicit time dependence. A class of self-limiting growth models dealing with

animal and tumor growth and bacterial population in a culture, on the other

hand are described by kinetics with explicit functions of time. We analyze a

reaction-diﬀusion system to study the propagation of spatial front for these

models.

I. INTRODUCTION

Reaction-diﬀusion systems are ubiquitous in almost all branches of physics [1], chemistry

[2] and biology [3–5] dealing with population growth, ﬂuid dynamics, pulse propagation in

nerves, chemical reactions, optical and other processes. The basic equation describes the

dynamics of a ﬁeld variable n(x, t), a function of space and time in terms of a source term

(also known as reaction term) and a diﬀusion term. An important early endeavor in this

direction is the study of self-limiting growth models of which the most well-known is the

Fisher equation [6,7] which takes into account of a linear growth and a nonlinear decay.

The model and many of its variants have found wide applications both from theoretical

and experimental point of view [4]. A notable feature of these models is that the source or

the reaction terms do not involve any explicit time dependence. On the other hand there

are situations [8–10] where the source terms contain explicit functions of time which put a

constraint on the growth process in the long time limit. For example, the Gompertz growth

[8,9] is a model used for study of growth of animals and tumors, where the growth rate is

proportional to the current value, but the proportionality factor decreases exponentially in

time so that

where r and α are positive experimentally determined constants. Similarly another type of

model proposed to analyze the growth of bacterial population in culture [10] is described by

(1a)

(1b)

Again k and β are positive constants required to ﬁt the experimental data. An important

feature of these models is that unlike the logistic growth process the asymptotic value of the

density function n depends on its initial population.

Keeping in view of these experimental observations it is therefore worthwhile to generalize

the speciﬁc cases in terms of an explicit function of time φ(t) such that we write

dn
dt

= rn exp(−αt) ,

dn
dt

= knt exp(−βt2) .

2

dn
dt

= rnφ(t)

(2)

where r is a constant for the growth process and φ(t) may of the type (i) φ(t) = 1 for

exponential growth (ii) φ(t) = exp(−αt) for Gompertz growth (iii) φ(t) = t exp(−βt2) for

bacterial growth, etc.

The object of the present paper is to study a reaction-diﬀusion system with a reaction

term describing a class of self-limiting growth processes (2). Since in many living organisms

concentration dependent diﬀusivity [4,5,11–15] has been found to be essential to the modeling

of reaction-diﬀusion systems we investigate the interplay of this nonlinear diﬀusion and self-

limiting growth process in the dynamics. We show that the model and its variant with a

ﬁnite memory transport [16–25] admit of exact solutions. The dependence of the rate of

spread of the wave front on various parameters is explored.

II. THE REACTION-DIFFUSION SYSTEM

We consider a reaction-diﬀusion system with a source term describing self-limiting growth

and with a nonlinear diﬀusion term in the following form:

∂n(x, t)
∂t

= rnφ(t) +

Dn

∂
∂x

∂n
∂x

where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Our primary aim in this section is to provide an exact

solution of Eq.(3). To this end we ﬁrst make use of the following transformation

n(x, t) = ˜u(x, t) exp

t

φ(t′)dt′

(cid:19)

r
(cid:18)

in Eq.(3) to obtain

∂ ˜u(x, t)
∂t

= D exp

∂
∂x (

˜u

∂ ˜u
∂x )

.

(cid:19)

r
(cid:18)

We now introduce the scaled time variable τ as

τ = D

f (t′)dt′ ≡ G(t)

(say)

t

Z

(4)

(5)

(6a)

where

This reduces Eq.(5) to the following form

f (t) = exp[r

φ(t′)dt′]

.

t

Z

∂u(x, τ )
∂τ

=

∂
∂x (

u(x, τ )

∂u(x, τ )

∂x )

with ˜u(x, t) ≡ ˜u(x, G−1(τ )) = u(x, τ ) where time t has been expressed as an inverse function

G−1(τ ) according to Eq.(6a-6b).

Eq.(7) is the well-known Boltzmann nonlinear diﬀusion equation [1,26]. Now subject to

the initial condition of a unit point source at the origin,

n(x, 0) = δ(x) = ˜u(x, 0) = u(x, 0)

we solve Eq.(7) under the following boundary conditions

x→±∞ u(x, τ ) = 0
lim

∀τ > 0

and

+∞

−∞

Z

u(x, τ )dx = 1

∀τ > 0 .

(10)

Next we seek the similarity solution of the nonlinear diﬀusion equation (7). We make

use of the well-known similarity transformation [1,5,26,27]

in Eq.(7) to obtain

On integration Eq.(12) yields

u = τ −1/3v(z) and z = xτ −1/3

Since we are interested in the symmetric solutions with v′(0) = 0 we have put the integration

constant zero in going from Eq.(12) to (13). On further integration Eq.(13) results in the

solution

where A is a constant which can be determined from the condition (10) to obtain

v(z) = (A2 − z2)/6

|z| < A

= 0

|z| > A

A = (9/2)1/3

Therefore the solution of Eq.(7) in x and τ is given by

u(x, τ ) =

1
6τ

A2τ 2/3 − x2

i

|x| > Aτ 1/3

|x| < Aτ 1/3

It is interesting to note that by virtue of the relations (6a-6b) τ is dependent on r and

φ(t) which control the growth and self-limiting factors, respectively of the source term.

This implies that the shock-wave like behaviour with propagating wave-front at x = xf =

Aτ 1/3 as evident from the similarity solutions (15) critically depends on the reaction terms.

Speciﬁcally, the wave front propagates in the medium with speed

where f (t) is given by (6a) and in turn depends on the functional form of φ(t).

We now consider two speciﬁc cases to illustrate the spatial propagation patterns.

(i) φ(t) = 1

For a constant value of φ the model suggests an exponential growth. The relation (6a)

in this case can then be utilized to obtain f (t) = exp(rt) so that τ = (D/r)[exp(rt) − 1].

Putting this expression for τ in the solution (15) we have after using Eq.(4)

This solution clearly has a sharp wave-front at xf = Aτ 1/3 which propagates at a speed

To illustrate the spatial propagation of the population n(x, t) in time we plot in Fig-1

the spatial shock-wave like patterns for r = 1.0 and D = 1.0. It is apparent that the sharply

peaked distribution at t = 0 starts spreading relatively slowly with peak at x = 0 diminishing

with time upto a period t = 0.1 . Beyond this time the spatial growth of population becomes

comparatively large and it diverges due to the combined eﬀect of exponential growth and

nonlinear diﬀusion. For a much lower growth rate (r = 0.001), however, the population

spreads monotonically due to the nonlinear diﬀusion which overwhelms the eﬀect of growth

process. This is evident in Fig-1(b).

(ii) φ(t) = t exp(−βt2)

With the above expression for φ(t) for bacterial self-limiting growth we obtain from

(6a-6b)

and

f (t) = exp[(−r/2β)(exp(−βt) − 1)]

(19)

(20)

(21)

By deﬁning z = (r/2β) exp(−βt) the above expression can be reduced to the following form

The integral in (21) can be put into a standard form with the help of Ei-function [28] so

that τ can be expressed as

τ = D

exp(r/2β)
β

[Ei (−r/2β) − Ei ((−r/2β) exp(−βt))]

(22)

The corresponding density n(x, t) and the speed of the wave front dxf /dt at xf are given by

n(x, t) =

A2 (D exp(r/2β)/β)2/3 [Ei (−r/2β) − Ei (−(r/2β) exp(−βt))]2/3 − x2
(6D/β) [Ei(−r/2β) − Ei((−r/2β) exp(−βt))] exp[(r/2β) exp(−βt)]

respectively.

[Ei(−r/2β) − Ei((−r/2β) exp(−βt))]1/3

(24)

In Fig-2(a,b) we show the shock-wave like spread of population by plotting n(x, t) vs

x for several values of time for D = 1 and r = 1 . Since β puts a limit to the growth at

large time the peak of n(x, t) at x = 0 as shown in Fig-2(a) (β = 0.1) does not increase too

much as compared to the earlier case considered in Fig-1(a). It has been observed that for

a unique value of β ≥ 1.0 there is a monotonic decrease in the peak population n(x, t) at

x = 0. For smaller values of β (Fig-2(b)) the spread is similar to that in Fig-1(a). In Fig-2(c)

we exhibit the spatial front propagation for several values of growth rate r at a time t = 1.0

keeping D = 1 and β = 0.01. It is apparent that with increase of r the reaction dominates

over diﬀusion so that the peak population at x = 0 increases compared to spreading.

III. EFFECT OF FINITE MEMORY TRANSPORT

We now generalize the proposed reaction-diﬀusion model to include the eﬀect of ﬁnite

memory transport. It has been observed that an animal’s movement at a particular instant of

time often depends on its motion in the immediate past. This results in a delay in population

ﬂux, or a memory in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. A number of attempts have been made in

the recent literature [16–25] to analyze the delayed population growth in several models and

related context in heat conduction and transport processes. To consider a ﬁnite memory in

the present model we modify the nonlinear diﬀusion term in Eq.(3) to the following form:

= rn(x, t)φ(t) +

∂n(x, t)
∂t

∂
∂x "

t

0
Z

Dγ

exp[−γ(t − τ )]n(x, τ )

(25)

∂n(x, τ )
∂x

dτ

#

where γ refers to the inverse of relaxation time. The population ﬂux takes into account

of the relaxation eﬀect due to the delay of the particles in adopting a deﬁnite direction of

propagation. Diﬀerentiating both sides of the above equation with respect to t and using it

again we obtain

∂2n
∂t2 = (rφ − γ)

∂n
∂t

+ (r ˙φ + rφγ)n +

∂
∂x "

Dγn

∂n
∂x #

(26)

In the limit of vanishing relaxation time i.e, 1/γ →0 Eq.(26) reduces to Eq.(3). When

memory eﬀects are taken into account, the dispersal of the organisms are not mutually inde-

pendent. Hence the correlation between the successive movement of the diﬀusing particles

results in a delay in the transport. Thus Eq.(26) is a typical form of a delayed transport

equation.

(= n(x, t)) with z = x + ct satisﬁes

We now consider a speciﬁc case φ(t) = 1. Substitution of the traveling wave form N(z)

∂z2 = c(r − γ)

∂N
∂z

+ rγN + Dγ

∂

(27)

where c is the speed of the traveling wave to be determined.

We now consider the trial solution of Eq.(27) of the form N(z) = N0 exp(szb) subject

to the initial condition that at z = 0, N = N0, where s and b are positive constants to be

determined. Substitution of this solution in Eq.(27) yields the following relation

[c2s2b2z2(b−1) + c2sb(b − 1)z(b−2) − csb(r − γ)z(b−1)

−rγ] exp(szb) − DγN0sb[2sbz2(b−1) + (b − 1)z(b−2)]

× exp(2szb) ≡ L(z) = 0

For L(z) = 0, for all z, the coeﬃcients of exp(szb) and exp(2szb) within the square brackets

must vanish identically. For this the only acceptable solution for b is b = 1. We obtain

and

2s2DγN0 = 0

c2s2 − cs(r − γ) − rγ = 0

From the above two equations the solution for s is given by

s =

c[(1/γ) − (1/r)] + [c2 ((1/γ) − (1/r))2 + 4/r ((c2/γ) + 2DN0)]1/2
2 [(c2/γr) + (2DN0/r)]

In the limit of instantaneous relaxation, i.e, 1/γ →0 Eq.(30) yields

s =

c

−1 + (1 + (DN0r/c2))1/2
h
4DN0

i

Furthermore the above expression in the limit of weak diﬀusion D →0 we obtain from

Eq.(31) after a Taylor expansion

To determine the speed of the propagation of the wave front we now rearrange the

solution for s in (30) to obtain

c =

(r − γ) + [(r − γ)2 + 4(rγ − 2s2DγN0)]1/2
2s

For real values of c, the quantity inside the square root must be positive, which determines

the minimum value of c for s = r/c [ Eq.(32) ] as

s =

r
c

cmin =

2r2DγN0
(r + γ)2

Eq.(27) therefore admits of an exact traveling wave like solution

N(z) = N0 exp

c(r − γ) + (c2(r − γ)2 + 4rγ(c2 + 2DγN0))1/2
2(c2 + 2DγN0)





It is interesting to observe that the speed of the traveling wave front not only depends

on nonlinear diﬀusion and growth rate but also on the initial concentration and memory. A

comparison of the solutions in this section and in the previous one shows that (35) does not

reduces to Eq.(17) in the limit of vanishing relaxation time (1/γ → 0) although Eq.(26) goes

over to Eq.(3) under this condition. This is because of the fact that the nature of the partial

diﬀerential equation changes due to the inclusion of relaxation terms and also the boundary

conditions for the shock wave like ‘diﬀusing solutions’ (17) are diﬀerent for the travelling

wave front solution (35). The nature of the two solutions are thus generically diﬀerent. We

point out in passing that the dependence on initial concentration on speed as shown in (34)

is rather an unusual feature in reaction-diﬀusion system.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have analyzed a class of reaction-diﬀusion systems in which the kinetic

term describes the self-limiting growth processes of the Gompertz type and is an explicit

function of time. We have shown that the model can be solved exactly to analyze the spatial

front propagation problem. To make the model more realistic we have included the eﬀect

of ﬁnite relaxation to concentration-dependent diﬀusive processes. In view of the fact that

the source terms have their direct relevance on experimental measurement on animal and

tumor growth or bacterial culture we think that the solutions discussed in this paper will

be pertinent in the context of reaction-diﬀusion systems, in general.

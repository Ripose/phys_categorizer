Textual analysis of typical microbial genomes reveals that they have the statistical characteristics of
a DNA sequence of a much shorter length. This peculiar property supports an evolutionary model
in which a genome evolves by random mutation but primarily grows by random segmental self-
copying. That genomes grew mostly by self-copying is consistent with the observation that repeat
sequences in all genomes are widespread and intragenomic and intergenomic homologous genes are
preponderance across all life forms. The model predicates the coexistence of the two competing
modes of evolution: the gradual changes of classical Darwinism and the stochastic spurts envisioned
in “punctuated equilibrium”.

The genome of any organism extant is the culmination
of a long history of growth and evolution that extends
back to the origin of life. How much about this his-
tory can we learn from the present state of that genome?
When a genome is viewed as a text composed of the four
“letters” A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine) and T
(thymine), it is essentially a random text. This is so
because, as far as we know, genomes are made by a
“blind watchmaker” [1]. Whatever is not random about
a genome is caused by the forces of selection that in-
directly, subtly and slightly favor some random patterns
over others. This is why it is such a challenge to delineate
coding parts of a genome including genes and regulatory
sequences from noncoding parts, and especially so when
the eﬀort cannot beneﬁt from sequence similarity to other
known coding sequences [2].

Yet the randomness of genome is not of the trivial kind.
An example that hints at the potential complexity of the
genome-as-text is the distribution of the frequency of oc-
currence of oligonucleotides. (In what follows, frequency
will always mean frequency of occurrence, a k-mer is an
oligonucleotide of length k and a distribution of frequency
of k-mers will be called a k-mer distribution.) Frequency
of short k-mers has been used in studies of molecular
evolution [3–5]. The frequency of a k-mer is the number
of times it is seen through a sliding window of width k
when it traverses once across the genome. If the length
of the genome is L, the act just described is similar to
distributing L objetcs (we think of the genome as be-
ing circular) into 4k boxes, the total number of diﬀerent
k-mers. Hence when L is much greater than 4k, the k-
mer distribution for a simple random genome sequence
is expected to be a Poisson distribution with the mean
and deviation both being L/4k. By a simple random
genome sequence of a given base composition we mean
the sequence that would obtain when any sequence of
that base composition is thoroughly scramble.

Figure 1(a) shows the 6-mer distribution in a simple
random sequence of length one million bases (1 Mb) with
unbiased base composition. The mean of 244 and root-

mean-deviation of 15.5 characterize the distribution as
being Poisson. Figure 1(b) is the distribution obtained
from the complete genome of Escherichia coli [6] whose
base composition is essentially unbiased. (Microbial com-
plete genome sequences are taken from the GenBank [7].
In this work, the frequencies of k-mers in microbial com-
plete genomes are normalized to correspond to those of a
1 Mb long sequence by multiplying each frequency by a
factor equal to 106 divided by the length of the genome.)
While strikingly diﬀerent from Fig. 1(a), Figure 1(b)
is representative of microbial complete genomes with an
unbiased base composition. It has a root-mean-deviation
(140) that is nine times that of the simple random se-
quence. Whereas simple random sequence contains no
6-mers whose frequency is greater than 400 or less than
100, the corresponding numbers of 6-mers in the genome
of E. coli are about 500 and 510, respectively.

FIG. 1. Distribution of frequency of 6-mers of (a) a simple
random sequence 1 Mb long with 50% A+T content and (b) the
genome of E. coli, whose A+T content is approximately 50%.

Figure 2(a) shows the distribution of a simple random
sequence whose A+T content is 70% (it is a general fact
of genomes that the number of A and T bases are al-
most the same, similarly for C and G contents). The
single narrow peak seen in Figure 1(a) is now broken
into seven smaller peaks whose appearance is caused by

×

the bias in the base composition; the mean frequency of
(7/5)m(3/5)6−m, giving
6-mers with m A or T’s is 244
the positions of the seven peaks to be 11.4, 26.6, 62.0,
144, 337, 787, 1837, for m = 0 to 6, respectively (the last
peak is oﬀ scale in Figure 2). Figure 2(b) is the distribu-
tion obtained from the complete genome of Methanococ-
cus janaschii whose A+T content is approximately 70%
[8]. Although both distributions are very broad and have
large values for their root-mean-deviations - 264 for (a)
and 320 for (b) - that reﬂect an underlying highly biased
base composition, that for the genome of M. janaschii is
signiﬁcantly greater and the two distributions are in any
case again clearly dissimilar in detail.

FIG. 2. Distribution of frequency of 6-mers of (a) a simple
random sequence 1 Mb long with 70% A+T content and (b) the
genome of M. janaschii, whose A+T content is approximately
70%. The positions of the peaks in (a) are explained in the text.

When the 7-, 8- and 9-mer distributions are examined,
the discrepancy between a random sequence and com-
plete microbial genomes persists. We know of no previ-
ous explanation of this discrepancy. Even as one would
be tempted to attribute the cause of the discrepancy to
biological eﬀects, we shall show that that would likely be
a wrong conclusion and that more likely the observed dis-
tributions have an interesting stochastic origin. (When
10 the number of k-mers becomes too large for the
k
Poisson distribution to be a reliable yardstick for judging
whether a genome is simply random or not.)

≥

Although genomes are of the order of 1 Mb long,
the ratio of the mean of the 6-mer distribution to its
root-mean-deviation suggests the statistical property of
a much shorter sequence, perhaps as short as 10 kb. In E.
coli, that ratio is 1.74 (as opposed to a ratio of √244=15.6
for a simple random sequence 1 Mb long). Over all the
complete microbial genomes, the root-mean-deviation af-
ter bias in base composition is corrected for ranges from
96 to 218 and has an average of 154. This gives an av-
erage ratio of mean to root-mean-deviation of 1.58. In
terms of a Poisson distribution such a ratio corresponds
to a mean of 2.5 and a simple random sequence about
10 kb long, since there are 4096 6-mers. The 6-mer dis-
tribution of a 10 kb simple random sequence would have

about 3310 of the 6-mers occur one to four times, 3 to
4 of the 6-mers occur nine times and about one 6-mer
occur 10 times.
It would also have 350 of the 6-mers
not occurring altogether. Suppose we now duplicate this
simple random sequence 100 times to produce a 1 Mb
long sequence and let it undergo a number of single base
mutations, then we may expect the long sequence to have
a 6-mer distribution that begins to resemble Figure 2(b).
That is, it should have many 6-mers occurring more than
400 many times, some occurring close to 1000 times, and
many occurring fewer than 100 times.

It may not be very realistic to suggest that real
genomes are approximately high multiples of a much
shorter sequence, plus mutation. Sometime ago Ohno
conjectured that great leaps in evolution had been the
result of whole genome duplications [9]. The idea has re-
mained controversial; the present state of gene sequence
information from vertebrates makes it diﬃcult to either
prove or disprove this hypothesis [10], and phylogenetic
studies of families of mammalian genes indicate that if
ancient events of genome duplication did occur, they did
not play an important role in structuring the mammalian
chromosomes bearing such genes [11]. In any case, even
if events of whole genome duplication had occurred, it
probably did not occur a very large number of times. On
the other hand, there certainly have been a very large
number of events of duplications of shorter sequences.

Indeed most genomes have repetitive sequences (or re-
peat sequences) with lengths ranging from 1 base to many
kbs whose numbers of copies far exceed those would be
found in a simple random sequence. For example, in the
human genome repeat sequences account for at least 50%
and probably much more [12,13], because most ancient
repeats presumably have been rendered unrecognizable
as such by degenerative mutation.

Here, we propose a minimal model

for microbial
genome growth that incorporates duplication of DNA of
all lengths and that exhibits the observed k-mer distri-
butions of real genomes. The model employs the two
types of events that drives genomic changes, mutation
and DNA duplication. For simplicity mutation events
are represented by single base replacement (SBR). DNA
duplication events are represented by occasional random
duplication (RD) of a stretch of oligonucleotide with a
characteristic length of σ bases.

In the model genomes are single stranded and the ini-
tial state of a genome is a simple random sequence of
legth L0 with a given base composition. From the initial
state the genome evolves and grows by (base composi-
tion preserving) SBR and RD events until its length just
exceeds 1 Mb. In an RD event, the length l of the copied
sequence is ﬁrst randomly chosen (see below), then a site
p at least l sites from the end of the genome is randomly
chosen and the sequence from p to p + l
1 is copied
and inserted into the genome behind a second randomly
chosen site. The model has three parameters: the initial

−

length L0, the ratio η of the chances of having an SBR
or an RD event and the length scale σ. For the work
reported here L0 was held ﬁxed at 1000 and only the two
parameters η and σ were varied.

At each instance of an RD event, a length l not greater
than the current length Lc of the (artiﬁcial) genome for
the duplicated segment is chosen as follows. We con-
struct a function G such that, given a random num-
ber y between zero and one, the duplicated segment
length is l = G(σ; y). Let w(x), the probability per
unit length of selecting a segment of length x, be pro-
Lc
portional to e−x/σ. Then from R
0 w(x)dx = 1 one has
w(x) = σ−1e−x/σ(1
e−Lc/σ)−1. The recognition that
l
inverse of G is given by G−1(l) = y = R
0 w(x)dx yields

Suppose the ﬁnal genome length L is much greater
than L0 and σ (this will be the case here), then the total
number of RD events will be somewhat greater than L/σ
and the total number of SDR events will be somewhat
greater than ηL/σ.

η = 500 and σ = 15, 000 is seen to have a 6-mer distribu-
tion (gray) surprisingly similar to that of E. coli (black).
No attempts were made to ﬁne-tune the two parameters
to get a “perfect” ﬁt. In Figure 4 (5, respectively) the
distributions for the model genome (gray) generated with
η = 600 and σ = 15, 000 and for the genome (black) of
Bacillus subtilis [14] (M. janaschii) are compared; both
have approximately 60% (70%) A+T content. The peaks
caused by biased base composition that one expects to
see in a Poisson distribution (and seen in Figure 2(a))
are no longer evident in the distributions from the model
genomes in Figures 4 and 5, just as they do not show in
the distributions from real genomes. In particular, the
model seems to succeed with ease in accounting for the
very large number of 6-mers that occur with exception-
ally high and with exceptionally low frequencies seen in
most microbial genomes.

A+T content) (black) and a simple random sequence (50%

It turns out that if the model sequence is to have a
6-mer distribution similar to those of the representative
real microbial genomes, the total number of mutations
(for a sequence of canonical length 1 Mb) acting on the
model sequence needs to be around 40,000. From the dis-
cussion in the previous section, this implies the relation
25η should hold. The best results are obtained when

It is emphasized that the high degree of likeness be-
tween the distributions of the simulated and real genomes
notwithstanding, no claim is made of the general similar-
ity of the contents of the two genomes. If an alignment
were to be made between, say, an 1 kb segment from the
simulated genome and any segment of like length from
the real genome, then the degree of similarity between

them would be characteristic of that between two unre-
lated simple random sequences.

A conspicuous deviation of the k-mer distribution of
a real microbial genome from that of a simple random
sequence is the very large numbers of extremely frequent
and extremely rare 6-mers (or 7- and 8-mers) in the for-
mer. The 6-mer distribution of the real genomes looks
more like the distribution of a genome that grew ran-
domly one base at a time only to 10 kb long, but not
to one (or several) Mb long. We have shown that the
full-length microbial genome could have grown randomly
and have such an unexpected k-mer distribution pro-
vided that it grew mostly by random self-copying. And
we propose that it is this stochastic process, instead of
some unknown biological process, that has caused the
long genome to retain the statistical characteristics of its
much shorter ancient self.

Because the probability that a random stretch of DNA
would be a gene (that codes an RNA or a protein that
would fold and function) is so minuscule, a population
of genomes that stumbled upon a self-copying mecha-
nism would have had an enormous evolutionary advan-
tage over another unfortunate population that did not.
The preponderance of intragenomic and intergenomic ho-
mologous genes [15] across all life forms is testament to
the importance of this mechanism [6,8,12–14].

Self-copying growth may not be the only mechanism
through which microbial genomes acquire the statistical
characteristics of a much shorter sequence. Such char-
acteristics may well have an as yet unknown biological
rather than stochastic origin. Our model has the virtue
of simplicity. It also has several interesting implications
of which two are mentioned here. The model predicates
the coexistence of the two competing modes of evolu-
tion: the gradual changes of classical Darwinism and the
stochastic spurts as envisioned in “punctuated equilib-
rium” [16,17]. The fact that a present-day long genome
shares vital characteristics of its theoretical shorter ear-
lier self implies one knows something about its ancestor,
or the common ancestor of its relatives. Perhaps, by
pushing this notion harder and examining the genomes
closer, one may gain a deeper understanding of our uni-
versal ancestor [18].

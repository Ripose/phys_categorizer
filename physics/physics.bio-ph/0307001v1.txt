With the number of sequenced genomes now over one hundred, and the availability of rough
functional annotations for a substantial proportion of their genes, it has become possible to study
the statistics of gene content across genomes. Here I show that, for many high-level functional
categories, the number of genes in the category scales as a power-law in the total number of genes in
the genome. The occurrence of such scaling laws can be explained with a simple theoretical model,
and this model suggests that the exponents of the observed scaling laws correspond to universal
constants of the evolutionary process. I discuss some consequences of these scaling laws for our
understanding of organism design.

What fraction of a genome’s gene content is allotted to different functional tasks, and how does
this depend on the complexity of the organism? Until recently, there was simply no data to address
such questions in a quantitative way. Presently, however, there are more than 100 sequenced genomes
[7] in public databases, and protein-family classiﬁcation algorithms allow functional annotations for a
considerable fraction of the genes in each genome. Thus, it has become possible to analyze the statistics
of functional gene-content across different genomes, and here I present results on the dependency of the
number of genes in different high-level categories on the total number of genes in the genome.

Evaluating the functional gene-content of genomes

To estimate the number of genes in different functional categories each genome has to be functionally
annotated. The main results presented in this paper were obtained using the Interpro [1] annotations
of sequenced genomes available from the European Bioinformatics Institute [2]. To map the Interpro
annotations to high-level functional categories I used the Gene Ontology “biological process” hierarchy
[3] and a mapping from Interpro entries to GO-categories both of which can be obtained from the gene
ontology website [4]. For each GO category I collect all Interpro entries that map to it or to one of
its descendants in the “biological process” hierarchy. To minimize the effects of potential biases in the
mappings from Interpro to GO I only use high-level functional categories that are represented by at least
50 different Interpro entries. This leaves 44 high-level GO categories.

A gene with multiple hits to Interpro entries that are associated with a GO category has a higher
probability to belong to that category than a gene with only a single hit. To take this information into

1

account, I assume that if a gene i has nc
i independent hits to Interpro entries associated with GO category
c, than with probability 1 − exp(−βnc
i ) the gene belongs to the GO category. The results are generally
insensitive to the value of β (see the appendix), and I used β = 3 for the results shown below. The
estimated number of genes nc in a genome for a given GO category is then the sum nc = Pi 1 −
exp(−βnc

i ) over all genes i in the genome.

Figure 1: The number of transcription regulatory genes (red), metabolic genes (blue), and cell cycle
related genes (green) as a function of the total number of genes in the genome for bacteria (A) and
eukaryotes (B). Both axes are shown on logarithmic scales. Each dot corresponds to a genome. The
straight lines are power-law ﬁts. Archaea are not shown because the range of genome sizes in archaea is
too small for meaningful ﬁts. For completeness the archaeal results are shown in ﬁgure 3 in the appendix.

Figure 1 shows the results for the categories of transcription regulatory genes (red), metabolic genes
(blue), and cell-cycle related genes (green) for bacteria (panel A) and eukaryotes (panel B). Remarkably,
for each functional category shown, we ﬁnd an approximately power-law relationship (solid line ﬁts)1.
That is, if nc is the number of genes in the category, and g is the total number of genes in the genome,
we observe laws of the form: nc = λgα, where both λ and the exponent α depend on the category under
study. In fact, such power-laws are observed for most of the 44 high-level categories, and the estimated
values of the exponents for several functional categories are shown in Table 1. Note that a potential
source of bias in estimating these exponents is the occurrence of multiple genomes from the same or
closely-related species in the data. As shown in the appendix, removing this “redundancy” from the data
does not alter the observed exponents.

The power-law ﬁts and 99% posterior probability estimates for their exponents were obtained using
a Bayesian procedure described in the appendix. To assess the quality of the ﬁts, I measured, for each ﬁt,
the fraction of the variance in the data that is explained by the ﬁt. In bacteria, 26 out of 44 GO categories
have more than 95% of the variance explained by the ﬁt, 38 categories have more than 90% explained. In
eukaryotes, 26 categories have more than 95% percent explained by the ﬁt and 32 have more than 90%
explained by the ﬁt. However, with total gene number varying over less than two decades in bacteria,

1These power-laws as a function of total gene number should be distinguished from the power-law distributions of gene-

family sizes and other genomic attributes within a single genome [5, 6].

maximum likelihood estimate of the exponent while the second indicates the boundaries of the 99%
posterior probability interval.

and the small number of data points in eukaryotes, one may wonder how one can claim that power-laws
have been “observed”. First, the fact that I ﬁt the data to power-laws should not be mistaken for a claim
that the data can only be described by power-law functions. I only claim that the power-law is by far the
simplest functional form that ﬁts almost all the observed data. Second, when scatter plots such as those
shown in Fig. 1 are plotted on linear as opposed to logarithmic scales, it is clear even by eye that the
ﬂuctuations in the number of genes in a category scale with the total number of genes in the genome.
That is, the ﬂuctuations in the data suggest that logarithmic scales are the “natural” scales for this data.
This is further supported by the simple evolutionary model presented below.

One may also wonder to what extent the results are sensitive to the speciﬁc functional annotation
procedure. I performed a variety of tests to assess the robustness of the results, i.e. the observed power-
law scaling and the values of the exponents, to changes in the annotation methodology (see appendix).
These involve using entirely independent annotations based on Clusters of Orthologous Groups of pro-
teins (COG) [10], and a simple (crude) annotation scheme based on keyword searches of protein tables
for sequenced microbial genomes from the NCBI website [8]. As shown in the appendix, the observed
power-law scaling, and the values of the exponents are generally insensitive to these and other changes
in annotation methodology. It has to be noted, however, that all currently available annotation schemes,
including the ones used here, predict function from sequence homology and thus at some level assume
that functional homology can be inferred from sequence homology. The results reported here thus also
depend on this assumption.

Observed Exponents

Some functional categories, such as the large category of metabolic genes, occupy a roughly constant
fraction of a genome’s gene-content, as evidenced by their exponent of 1. However, many categories
show signiﬁcant deviations from this “trivial” exponent. Genes related to cell-cycle or protein biosyn-
thesis have exponents signiﬁcantly below 1, whereas for transcription factors (TFs) the exponent is sig-
niﬁcantly above 1. These trends are strongest in bacteria. There the exponent for TFs is almost 2,
implying that as the number of genes in the genome doubles, the number of TFs quadruples. This has
some interesting implications for “regulatory design” in bacteria. It implies that the number of TFs per
gene grows in proportion to the size of the genome (see [9] for a similar observation). This in turn im-
plies that, in larger genomes, each gene must be regulated by a larger number of TFs and/or each TF
must be regulating a smaller set of genes. An exponent of 2 is also observed for two-component sys-
tems2, which are the primary means by which bacteria sense their environment. This suggests that the
relative increase in transcription regulators in more complex bacteria is accompanied by an equal relative
increase in sensory systems.

The difﬁculties with gene prediction and annotation in eukaryotes, the small number of available
genomes, and our lack of understanding of the role of alternative splicing across eukaryotic genomes
make it premature to draw many conclusions from Fig. 1B. However, the main trends from Fig. 1A
are reproduced: the super linear scaling of TFs, the sub linear scaling of cell-cycle genes, and the small
exponents for DNA replication and protein biosynthesis genes.

The observed super linear scaling of TFs also has implications for our understanding of “combi-
natorial control” in transcription regulation. It is well established that in complex organisms, different
TFs combine into complexes to affect transcription control. Therefore, a relatively small number of TFs
can implement a combinatorially large number of different transcription regulatory “states”, which may
correspond to particular external environments, developmental stages, tissues, combinations of exter-
nal stimuli, etcetera. Each such regulatory state will be associated with a unique set of genes that are
expressed in that state. If the number of such regulatory states were proportional to the total number
of genes, then the number of TFs would increase much more slowly than the total number of genes.
However, the scaling results show that, instead, the number of TFs increases more rapidly than the total
number of genes. This thus implies that the number of regulatory states is also “combinatorial” in the
total number of genes: a relatively small number of genes is used in different combinations to implement
combinatorially many regulatory states.

The picture that emerges is not of TFs being used in different combinations to implement the regu-
latory needs of individual genes. But rather that, as one moves from simple to more complex organisms,
the number of regulatory states grows so much faster than the total number of genes that, even with com-
binatorial control of transcription, the number of TFs grows much faster than the total number genes.

Evolutionary model

One of course wonders about the origins of these scaling laws in genome organization, and I like to
present some speculations in this regard. Assume that most changes in the number of genes nc in a
functional category c are caused by duplications and deletions. Then, nc(t) generally evolves according

2Note that two-component systems were not in the list of 44 high-level categories.

4

to the equation

dnc(t)
dt

= (β(t) − δ(t))nc(t) = ρ(t)nc(t),

with β(t) and δ(t) respectively the duplication- and deletion-rate of the genes in this category at time
t in the evolutionary history of the genome. For simplicity of notation I have introduced the difference
of duplication and deletion rates ρ(t), which can be thought of as an “effective” duplication rate. This
rate ρ(t) is presumably proportional to the difference between the average probability that selection will
favor ﬁxation of a duplicated gene from this category and the average probability that selection will favor
deletion of a gene from this category. Similarly, the total number of genes g(t) obeys the equation

(1)

(2)

dg(t)
dt

= γ(t)g(t),

with γ(t) the overall effective rate of gene duplication in the genome at time t in its evolutionary history.
When we solve for nc as a function of g we ﬁnd

nc = λghρi/hγi,
where hρi and hγi are the mean effective duplication rates of genes in category c and the entire genome
respectively, averaged over the evolutionary history of the genome, and λ is a constant that depends on
the boundary conditions. In order for all bacterial genomes to obey the same functional relation, the
constant λ and the ratios hρi/hγi have to be the same for all bacterial evolutionary lineages. Since all life
shares a common ancestor, the boundary conditions for equations (1) and (2) are trivially the same for all
bacterial lineages, implying that the constant λ is indeed the same for all bacterial lineages. In summary,
simply assuming that changes in gene-number occur mostly through duplications and deletions implies
our observed power-law scaling if the ratios hρi/hγi are the same for all evolutionary lineages.

(3)

I thus propose that the explanation for the observed scaling-laws is that the ratios hρi/hγi are indeed
the same for all bacterial lineages, i.e. these ratios of average duplication rates are “universal constants”
of genome evolution. For instance, the exponent 2 for TFs in bacteria indicates that, in all bacterial
lineages, evolution selects duplicated TFs twice as frequently as duplicated genes in general. It seems
likely that such universal constants are intimately connected to fundamental design principles of the
evolutionary process. It is tempting to become even more speculative in this regard, and suggest that
this factor of 2 in duplication rate is related to switch-like function of transcription factors: with each
addition of a transcription factor the number of transcription-regulatory states of the cell doubles. It is
not entirely implausible to assume that with twice the number of internal states available, the probability
of such a duplication being ﬁxed in evolution is twice as large as the probability of ﬁxing a duplicated
gene that does not double the number of internal states of the cell.

Finally, as table 1 shows, there is still substantial uncertainty about the exact numerical values of
the exponents given the current data, and many more genomes are needed to estimate these values more
accurately. A survey of the NCBI genome database [7] shows that the number of sequenced genomes is
increasing exponentially, with a doubling time of about 16 months (Fig. 2). This suggests that within
a few years thousands of genomes will become available. With such an increase in available data it
will become possible to look at much more ﬁne-grained gene content statistics than the ones presented
here. One can for instance imagine going beyond looking at single functional categories at a time, and
investigate if there are correlations in the variations of gene number in more ﬁne-grained functional
categories. I believe that such investigations have the potential to teach us much about the functional
design principles of the evolutionary process.

Genes in genome

related genes (green) as a function of the total number of genes in archaea. Both axes are shown on
logarithmic scales. Each dot corresponds to a genome. The straight lines are power-law ﬁts.

of the largest archaeal genome differs from that of the smallest by only a factor of approximately 3.
Consequently, there is large uncertainty regarding the values of the exponents for archaea. The maxi-
mum likelihood values and 99% posterior probability intervals are 2.1 and [1.3 − 5.7] for transcription
regulatory genes, 0.81 and [0.44 − 1.48] for metabolic genes, and 0.83 and [0.54 − 1.35] for cell-cycle
related genes.

Power-law Fitting

The power-law ﬁts in ﬁgure 1 were obtained using a Bayesian straight-line ﬁtting procedure. For each
GO-category, I log-transform the data such that each data point (xi, yi) corresponds to the logarithm of
the estimated total number of genes, and the logarithm of the estimated number of genes in the category
respectively. I assume that these transformed data where drawn from a linear model

y = α(x + ǫ) + λ + η,

where η and ǫ are “noise” terms in the x- and y-coordinates respectively and λ in an unknown off-set. I
assume that the joint-distribution P (η, ǫ) is a two-dimensional Gaussian with means zero and unknown
variances and co-variance. That is, I use scale invariant priors for the variances, and will integrate these
nuisance variables out of the likelihood. A uniform prior is used for the location parameter λ, and for the
slope α I will use a rotation invariant prior:

P (α)dα =

dα
(1 + α2)3/2 .

8

The use of these priors guarantees that the results are invariant under all shifts and rotations of the plane.
Integrating over all variables except for α, we obtain for the posterior P (α|D) given the data D:

P (α|D)dα = C

(α2 + 1)(n−3)/2dα
(α2sxx − 2αsyx + syy)(n−1)/2 ,

where n is the number of genomes in the data, sxx is the variance in x-values (logarithms of the total
gene numbers), syy the variance in y-values (logarithms of the number of genes in the category), syx is
the co-variance, and C is a normalizing constant. The values of the exponents reported in table 1 are the
values of α that maximize P (α|D), and the boundaries of the 99% posterior probability interval around
it.

For each ﬁt, I also measure what fraction of the variance in the data is explained by the ﬁt. That is, I
compare the average distance d of the points in the plane to their center of mass with the average distance
dl of the points to the ﬁtted line and deﬁne the fraction q = 1 − dl/d as the variance in the data explained
by the ﬁt.

Robustness of the results

I ﬁrst checked that the total amount of available annotation information is not itself dependent on genome
size. If the total amount of available annotation information were to vary with the number of genes in
the genome, this could lead to biases in the estimated exponents. To exclude this possibility, I counted
the total number of genes with any Interpro hits in each genome and found that, for both bacteria and
eukaryotes, the fraction of genes in the genome with Interpro hits is about 2/3, independent of the total
number of genes in the genome. Consistent with this observation, when one ﬁts power-laws to the number
of genes nc in a GO-category c as a function of the total number of annotated genes in the genome, one
ﬁnds exponents that are very close to those founds for nc as a function of the total number of genes in
the genome.

Second, I tested that the results are insensitive to the value of the parameter β. The default value
β = 3 gives a gene with a single Interpro hit a probability of 1 − e−3 ≈ 0.95 to belong to the category.
This is reasonable because Interpro is designed to only report statistically signiﬁcant hits. To assess the
effect of changing β, results for β = 1 were generated. For bacteria the change in ﬁtted exponent is
less than 5% for 26 of 44 categories, and less than 10% for 39 categories. For eukaryotes the exponent
changes by less than 5% for all but 3 categories. In all cases, the change in ﬁtted exponent is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the 99% posterior probability intervals associated with the exponents of the ﬁts.

Third, I tested the robustness of the results against removal of potential “redundancies” in the data.
For bacteria there are several examples where multiple genomes of the same species or genomes of very
closely related species occur in the data, and one might suspect that these may bias the results in some
way. To this end, I parsed the names of all bacterial species into a general and a speciﬁc part, e.g. for
Escherichia Coli Escherichia is the general part and coli the speciﬁc part, for Listeria innocua Listeria
is the general part and innocua the speciﬁc part, etcetera. Groups of genomes with the same general part
were then collected together and for each group the gene numbers were replaced with a single average
of total gene number and average gene counts in each of the functional categories. This reduces the
size of the data set by about a third. Power-law ﬁtting was then applied to this reduced set and the
ﬁtted exponents were compared with those of the full data set. The maximum likelihood exponent was

9

changed by less than 5% in 31 out of 44 categories. The largest observed change was an 18% change in
the exponent. All changes to the exponents were well within the 99% posterior probability intervals.

More importantly, the results could depend on the use of Interpro, the Gene Ontology, and the map-
ping of Interpro entries to GO categories. To test the robustness of the results to biases inherent in
Interpro annotation and/or the mapping from Interpro to Gene Ontology, I analyzed selected functional
categories using two other annotation schemes.

The ﬁrst is based on Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) [10] annotation of 63 bacte-

rial genomes that can be obtained from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/COG/COG.
In this data set, proteins of the 63 bacterial genomes are assigned to COGs, and the COGs have been
assigned to functional categories. I used these assignments to count the number of genes in different
functional categories according to the COG annotation scheme. A comparison of the exponents for
COG functional categories and the exponents for the closest GO categories obtained using the Interpro
annotations are shown in table 2.

The second alternative annotation scheme I used is based on simple keyword searches of protein

tables for fully-sequenced bacterial genomes available from the NCBI ftp site:
ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria.
Removing genomes for which little or no annotation exists, this leaves protein tables for 90 bacterial
genomes. Each protein in these protein tables is annotated with a short description line. The number
of genes in different functional categories was counted by searching each description line for hits to a
set of keywords that characterize the category. For instance, I chose the keywords “ribosom”, “trans-
lation”, and “tRNA” for the category “protein biosynthesis”, and the gene is counted as belonging to
this category if any of these keywords occurs in its description line. For the other categories I used the
following keywords: “transcription” for the category “transcription”; “transport”, “channel”, “efﬂux”,
“pump”, “porin”, “export”, “permease”, “symport”, “transloca”, and “PTS” for the category “transport”;
all combinations “X Y” with X being one of “ion”, “sodium”, “calcium”, “potassium”, “magnesium”,
and “manganese”, and Y being one of “channel”, “efﬂux”, “transport”, and “uptake” for the category
“ion transport”; ‘protease” and “peptidase” for the category “protein degradation”; “kinase” for the cat-
egory “kinase”; and ﬁnally the phrases ‘DNA polymerase”, “topoisomerase”, “DNA gyrase”, “DNA
ligase”, “replication”, “helicase”, “DNA primase”, “DNA repair”, “cell division”, and “septum” for the
category “cell cycle”. The exponents resulting from this (crude) annotation scheme are also shown in
table 2. As table 2 shows, there is good quantitative agreement between the exponents that are obtained
with the different annotation schemes.

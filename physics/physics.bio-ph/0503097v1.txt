Abstract

Gel electrophoresis allows to separate knotted DNA (nicked circu-
lar) of equal length according to the knot type. At low electric ﬁelds,
complex knots being more compact, drift faster than simpler knots.
Recent experiments have shown that the drift velocity dependence on
the knot type is inverted when changing from low to high electric ﬁelds.
We present a computer simulation on a lattice of a closed, knotted,
charged DNA chain drifting in an external electric ﬁeld in a topolog-
ically restricted medium. Using a simple Monte Carlo algorithm, the
dependence of the electrophoretic migration of the DNA molecules on
the type of knot and on the electric ﬁeld intensity was investigated.
The results are in qualitative agreement with electrophoretic experi-
ments done under conditions of low and high electric ﬁelds: especially
the inversion of the behavior from low to high electric ﬁeld could be
reproduced. The knot topology imposes on the problem the constrain
of self-avoidance, which is the ﬁnal cause of the observed behavior in
strong electric ﬁeld.

Gel electrophoresis of linear and circular DNA and its dynamics has
been since long time a topic on which numerical simulations and analytical
models have been applied [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

Most experimental and theoretical studies of the electrophoresis process
deal with linear or circular DNA [9, 10, 11, 12]. But DNA comes also in
knotted form. Various classes of enzymes (topoisomerases and site-speciﬁc
recombination enzymes) produce diﬀerent types of knots or catenanes by
acting on circular DNA molecules [13, 14]. The analysis of these knots gives
some information about the mechanisms by which these enzymes are in-
volved in the proper functioning of chromosomes (see for example [15]) and
about DNA packing [16]. Being able to study which knots are produced by
a given enzyme in prescribed conditions implies being able to perform some
sort of ”knot spectroscopy”, which can be done for example by electron mi-
croscopy, where knots are observed one by one. Yet, if large numbers of knots
need to be classiﬁed, then some high throughput technique is needed. Such
a technique is gel electrophoresis.
Indeed, experimental work has shown
a linear relationship between the distance of electrophoretic migration on
agarose gel of diﬀerent types of DNA knots (all with the same number of
base pairs) and the average crossing number of the ideal geometrical repre-
sentations of the corresponding knots (closely related to the complexity of
the knot)[18]. As a consequence, the type of a knot can be simply identiﬁed
by measuring its position on the gel, without the need of electron microscopy
experiments as required until recently.

At low electric ﬁeld the usual observation is that the more complex the
knot is, the higher is its mobility. A simple intuitive explanation for this
behavior is that the compactness of a knot increases with its complexity (for
a constant string length) and the friction coeﬃcient γ = 6πη0RH (with RH
the hydrodynamic radius of the knot and η0 the viscosity of the solvent)
is smaller, resulting in higher mobilities. A more reﬁned calculation of the
friction coeﬃcient γ relies on Kirkwood-Riseman formula [19]:

agitated DNA molecules forming diﬀerent types of knots has conﬁrmed the
experimental results [20].

Recently, it was observed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis
that when the strength of the electric ﬁeld is increased, the electrophoretic
mobility of DNA knots changes behavior (ﬁg. 1) [17, 21]. The experiment
was performed in two steps: a low strength electric ﬁeld of 0.6 V cm−1 was
ﬁrst applied along one direction in the gel. At this step, more complex knots
show a higher mobility, in agreement with Kirkwood-Riseman formula. The
same procedure is repeated in a second step but with a stronger electric
ﬁeld (5 V cm−1) applied perpendicularly to the ﬁrst one. In this case, the
opposite behavior is observed: more complex knots cover smaller distances
than simple ones.

The presence of two regimes of weak and strong electric ﬁeld can be
captured with a simple argument. A knot of size ξ drifts over a distance equal
to its size along the direction of the applied electric ﬁeld E in a time tξ ≃
ξ/v = γξ/qE, where v = qE/γ is the drift velocity in the stationary regime
and q the total electrical charge carried by the DNA molecule. During the
2Dtξ =
same time, the drifting knot diﬀuses laterally over a distance d ≃
qE ξ, where T is the absolute temperature and kB is the
Boltzmann’s constant. If the transverse diﬀusion explores distances d much
q
larger than the typical size of the knot, ξ, then, on average, the knot will be
able to avoid a collision with the gel and the knots will drift as if they were in
a pure solution, with just a slight renormalization of the friction coeﬃcient.
If instead d ≪ ξ, then whenever a knot is on a collision course with a gel
strand, it can not avoid it. As a consequence, after impinging over the
obstacle, the knot needs to crawl around it in order to free itself. Crawling
around an obstacle is much more diﬃcult for more complex knots than for
simple ones, due to the self-avoidance constraint. Following this argument,
the two electric ﬁeld regimes are separated by a critical ﬁeld Ec that can be
obtained by setting d ≃ ξ, giving Ec ≃ 2 kB T
qξ . In order to estimate Ec we
use the typical values for a 11′000 base pairs DNA knot: the size of a closed
DNA ring is about ξ = 300 nm[22]; the total charge q depends on the gel
conditions, since every nucleotide carries a P − group, hence one electron
negative charge, that can be strongly screened by charges in the solvent. As
a consequence we use q ∼ 10−15 − 10−16C. We then obtain a critical ﬁeld
Ec = 0.1 − 1 V cm−1 in reasonable agreement with experiments[17, 21]. The
expression for the critical electric ﬁeld holds also in the case when the gel
is concentrated as it is the case in many experiments. Under the condition
of high gel density, the DNA is ﬁlling the pores and the expression for the

3

collision condition is that the DNA lying between two gel strands will collide
with one gel strand before the DNA can drift transversally to the electric
ﬁeld. Instead of ξ, one has to insert the gel pore size ℓ. The lateral diﬀusion
constant D∗ has to be rescaled in order to include the eﬀect of the gel. The
condition for the critical electric ﬁeld reads again: Ec ≃ 2 kB T
qℓ .

One has also to note that the two conditions for the critical electric ﬁeld
Ec actually mean that the energy gained by the DNA when moving one
diameter ξ or one pore size ℓ along the electric ﬁeld is equal to twice the
thermal energy: qEcξ (or ℓ) ≃ 2kBT . Although the above model gives a
ﬁrst hint of the origin of the observed behavior, here we want to address the
issue more thoroughly using lattice Monte Carlo simulations.

DNA knots are modelled by closed self-avoiding walks (SAWs) composed
of N segments of length a on a three-dimensional cubic lattice (the lattice
constant a is comparable to the persistence length of the DNA molecules).
The gel is a two dimensional grid forming a sublattice with a mesh size b
(= gel parameter) and perpendicular to the applied electric ﬁeld (so that
no knots can ever get impaled). The gel lattice is shifted by the quantity
2 , a
( a
2 ) compared to the knot lattice, so that no points of the knot lie on
the gel. Knots are not allowed to cross the gel network. The coordinates of
the N monomers in the conﬁguration at time t are written as:

2 , a

¯r(t) = (~r1(t), ~r2(t), ..., ~rN (t))

(2)

with constraints k~rj(t) − ~rj+1(t)k = a.

The dynamics is followed using the BFACF algorithm [23]. Two types
of moves are allowed: (a) the creation/destruction of a handle and (b) the
ﬂip of a corner into the mirror position (see Fig.2). The ﬁrst move clearly
does not preserve the knot length, which can vary by ±2 at every step, but
introduces the knot elasticity. The BFACF algorithm preserves knot classes,
within which it is ergodic [24]. Self-avoidance is imposed by disallowing
monomers to visit any site which is already occupied by other monomers.
Furthermore, knots are not allowed to cross gel rods, so that corner ﬂips and
handle creation/destruction are forbidden when a rod has to be crossed.

Under an external uniform electric ﬁeld ~E, the electrostatic energy at

time t is given by:

N (t) is the length of the knot at time t, and it is associated with an elastic
energy

used. The knot energy is then E(t) = Eq(t) + Eel(t).

At each timestep, we choose a point at random on the chain and pro-

and gel-avoiding constraints, it is accepted with a probability given by the
Metropolis algorithm:
if the energy of the new trial conﬁguration, Etrial,
is lower than that of the previous conﬁguration, Eold = E(t), the move is
accepted and ¯r(t + 1) = ¯rtrial; otherwise, the probability of acceptance of
the trial conﬁguration is equal to exp{−[Etrial − E(t)]}/kB T . If the move is
rejected, then ¯r(t + 1) = ¯r(t).

After a knotted conﬁguration is randomly generated, the knot type is ob-
tained by calculating its Alexander polynomial [25]. Then, we let the system
freely relax to thermodynamic equilibrium in the absence of an external ﬁeld
(E = 0) until correlations from the initial conﬁguration have disappeared.
Then the electric ﬁeld is switched on, and we let the knots migrate on the
lattice. The quantities we compute are the position of the center-of-mass
and the average crossing number (ACN) of the knot along a trajectory.

Time is measured in Monte Carlo iterations, length in lattice spacing.
The initial length N0 of our polymers was set to 150, and the mean length
of the knot depends generally on the electric ﬁeld and on the gel parameter.
However, the mean length is 145 (146) for C=0.1 (C=0.4) and b=20 and
we checked that during the simulations it ﬂuctuates around that value. The
average length is slightly shorter that N0, since the probability of shortening
the polymer is a slightly larger than the probability of lengthening it due to
the self-avoiding condition. The gel parameter was set to b = 5, 10, 20 (in
units of a), corresponding to a relatively sparse gel with big pores. For each
initial knot, 20 · 106 iterations were performed. The center-of-mass position
has been measured every 1000 Monte Carlo steps, and it was then averaged
over the trajectories obtained by the migration of 100-200 diﬀerent initial
knots (to obtain an accuracy of about 10%).

One problem with the Monte Carlo algorithm is that more complex knots
have a smaller drift velocity than less complex ones even in absence of the
gel, when time is measured in Monte Carlo steps. This is due to the fact that
already in the absence of the gel, the moves are hindered by the complexity
of the knot. In order to correct this problem, we used Kirkwood-Riseman
formula (1) to compute the friction coeﬃcient γ of every knot: since then
v = qE/γ, we can ﬁnd the speciﬁc time rescaling necessary to go from Monte
Carlo time (tM C) to real time (tR): tR = (γvM C/qE)tM C , where vM C is the
velocity measured using tM C. Once we ﬁnd the time conversion (one for
every knot class) in the absence of the gel, then we apply it throughout our

5

simulations in the gel.

Let us begin with the study of the dependence of the velocity with respect
to the adimensional constant C = qEa/kBT for knot type 31 (if we assume
that length ﬂuctuations are very small, energy variations for the Metropolis
algorithm can be expressed as integer multiples of kBT C). We observe two
distinct behaviors for the migration of knots (see ﬁg. 3) as a function of C.
At high temperature or weak electric ﬁeld, the distance of migration is
linear as a function of C. On the other hand, above a critical value of Ccrit,
the average speed of the knots is decreasing with C, in qualitative agreement
with the experimental results. For our parameters, Ccrit is located around
0.4 for the 31 knot. Clearly, this value depends on the length of the knot
and on its type (it can also depend on the gel parameter b if b < ξ, the
typical size of the knot).
If the electric ﬁeld is strong, or temperature is
low, knots tend to hang over obstacles and take a U-shape conﬁguration.
When a knot hits a gel rod, it can easily remain trapped there, because the
probability of a backward step is very small, and it is a growing function of
the temperature T . Trapping in U-shape conformations introduces plateaus
in the migration distance as a function of time for individual knots, hence
reducing the average migration velocity. On the same graph (ﬁg. 3), the
drift velocity for a 81 knot is depicted as a function of C. The general
behavior is similar to the 31 knot, but the drift speed at low C is higher than
for the 31 knot (as it is the case in the experiments). But the most striking
feature is that at C ≈ 0.2 − 0.3 the two curves cross each other and the 31
is faster than the 81 for C > 0.3. This is also the observed behavior in the
experiments.

We investigate now the eﬀect of the knot type for both weak and strong
electric ﬁelds (C = 0.1 and C = 0.4 respectively) for eleven types of knots
(31, 41, 51, 52, 61, 62, 63, 71, 72, 73 and 81) all consisting of 150 monomers.
For each knot type, we extract the average velocity from the distance of
time curve. The velocity of migration is then plotted as
migration vs.
a function of the measured ACN, that is related to the knot type. This
plot is done ﬁrst only for the high electric ﬁeld case (C = 0.4) in ﬁg. 4.
We observe that there is a fairly linear relationship (except for the 31 knot)
between the average velocity of knots and the ACN (measure of complexity).
More complex knots migrate slower than simpler ones at strong electric ﬁelds
(although much noisier than for weak ﬁelds). These results are in agreement
with experiments. A similar plot was done for the low electric ﬁeld (C = 0.1)
and the results are depicted in ﬁg. 5 (ﬁlled squares).

The intuitive view of a knot making its way through the pores of the
gel would have as a consequence that more complex (thus more compact)

6

knots migrate faster than simple knots, because they are less disturbed by
the gel. This is indeed what happens in weak electric ﬁelds. In the strong
ﬁeld regime our simulations are in agreement with experiments and show
the opposite behavior, indicating that the knot collides with the gel and
that the condition of self-avoidance makes the migration of compact knots
around the gel strands more diﬃcult. Somehow, parts of the knot have to
go around other parts of itself, a process which is much longer for complex
knots than for simple knots.

The trapping of linear open polymers in U-shape conformations is ac-
tually an artifact:
indeed the slightest diﬀerence in the length of the two
arms of the U gives rise to a net electric force that allows the polymer to
slide around the obstacle. Simple local Monte Carlo moves do not allow
to capture this dynamics. Yet, adding suitable non-local moves is enough
to eliminate the artiﬁcious slowing down of the dynamics and cures the ex-
ponentially long relaxation times of thermal activation around the obstacle
[6, 28]. However, the closed knot topology of DNA in our numerical sim-
ulations does not allow to introduce the long range moves. Moreover, we
argue that exponentially long relaxation times present in our simulations
aﬀect, in ﬁrst approximation, all the knots irrespective of their topology.
In the ideal case of purely mechanical and frictionless unbinding, one can
easily check that the knot complexity introduces at most a small logarith-
mic correction according to which more complex knots would anyway unpin
faster in contradiction with both experiments and our simulation. There-
fore, the simulated absolute drift velocity vabs is aﬀected by a time scale
that is artiﬁcially stretched in essentially the same way independent on the
knot class. So, by looking at the ratios of the absolute velocities, this time
scale should in ﬁrst approximation cancel out. In Figure 5 we plot the sim-
m.n/vabs
ulated and experimental ratios vabs
3.1 as function of the ACN. In this
Figure the open points represent data from Sogo et al.[21], and the ﬁlled
symbols our simulation results. The ACN values for each knot were taken
from Vologdskii et al. [20]. The agreement between experimental data and
simulations is remarkable. In weak electric ﬁeld, the transport properties of
DNA knots are dominated by the hydrodynamics of the knots and the gel
plays a minor role. At high electric ﬁelds, the knot-gel interaction is pre-
dominant and it is responsible for the inversion of behavior. In particular,
strong DNA-gel interactions enhance the eﬀect of self-avoidance within the
knotted DNA and self-avoidance must be included in simulations in order
to reproduce the correct behavior. This is at variance with simulations of
gel electrophoresis of linear DNA where self-avoidance is usually neglected
because of the two following reasons: ﬁrst, according to the repton model,

7

DNA crawls along tubes in the gel and it is in an elongated conﬁguration
where self-intersections are negligible. Secondly, it is often assumed that
the drifting DNA can be considered to be in a semi-dilute solution regime,
where polymers obey random walk statistics. Instead, in our case the con-
servation of the knot topology during the dynamics imposes the inclusion of
self-avoidance.

We presented some results of a Monte Carlo simulation of DNA knots in
a gel in three dimensions. In summary, our model allows to explain the high
electric ﬁeld behavior observed in experimental DNA knots gel electrophore-
sis. The variation of the gel parameter does not change qualitatively the
results. However, in a denser gel, the knots get stuck at shorter distances.
In a more realistic modelization of the gel, the gel ﬁbers should be allowed
to break and let the knots migrate further. Varying the length of the knots
would probably also bring some further insights into the mechanisms of the
migration in a gel.

ACN

Figure 5: Distance of migration in gel for the experimental data or drift
velocity for the simulated data vs. ACN (from [20]) for knots from 31 to
81. Open symbols are data from Sogo et al.
[21], ﬁlled symbols are the
simulated values of the drift velocity. Squares are for low electric ﬁeld (E =
0.6 V /cm and C = 0.1, respectively), while triangles are for high electric
ﬁeld (E = 5 V /cm and C = 0.4). The values were all normalized to their
respective value for the knot 31.

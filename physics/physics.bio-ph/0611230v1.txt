We study the mechanical stiffening behavior in two-dimensional (2D) cross-linked networks of semiﬂexible
biopolymer ﬁlaments under simple shear. Filamental constituents immersed in a ﬂuid undergo thermally excited
bending motions. Pulling out these undulations results in an increase in the axial stiffness. We analyze this
stiffening behavior of 2D semiﬂexible ﬁlaments in detail: we ﬁrst investigate the average, static force-extension
relation by considering the initially present undulated conﬁguration that is pulled straight under a tensile force,
and compare this result with the average response in which undulation dynamics is allowed during pulling, as
derived earlier by MacKintosh and coworkers. We will show that the resulting mechanical behavior is rather
similar, but with the axial stiffness being a factor 2 to 4 larger in the dynamic model. Furthermore, we study the
stretching contribution in case of extensible ﬁlaments and show that, for 2D ﬁlaments, the mechanical response
is dominated by enthalpic stretching. Based on the single-ﬁlament mechanics, we develop a 2D analytical model
describing the mechanical behavior of biopolymer networks under simple shear, adopting the afﬁne deformation
assumption. These results are compared with discrete, ﬁnite-element (FE) calculations of a network consisting
of semiﬂexible ﬁlaments. The FE calculations show that local, nonafﬁne ﬁlament reorientations occur that
induce a transition from a bending-dominated response at small strains to a stretching-dominated response at
larger strains. Stiffening in biopolymer networks thus results from a combination of stiffening in individual
ﬁlaments and changes in the network topography.

INTRODUCTION

The mechanics of eukaryotic cells is largely governed by the
cytoskeleton, an interpenetrated network of biopolymer pro-
tein ﬁlaments, spanning the region between the cell’s nucleus
and membrane.
Its ﬁlamentous constituents are actin ﬁla-
ments, intermediate ﬁlaments and microtubules. It is impor-
tant to gain more insight in the physical origin of the me-
chanical behavior of the cytoskeleton in view of its role in
fundamental biological processes as cell division, cell motil-
ity and mechanotransduction. It is well known that network-
like biological tissues are compliant and respond to defor-
mation by exhibiting an increasing stiffness, i.e., the ratio
of change of stress and change of strain. Experimental re-
search on the viscoelastic strain stiffening behavior in such
biopolymer networks started in the 1980’s, e.g. by means of
micropipette and microtwisting experiments1 and rheological
experiments on in-vitro gels of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments (actin,
vimentin, keratin),2,3,4,5,6 neuronal intermediate ﬁlaments7
and ﬁbrin.8,9 Through these and numerous other studies, it
is well-established by now that not only the ﬁlamental con-
stituents but also the type and dynamics of cross-linking pro-
teins govern the mechanical response of such semiﬂexible
biopolymer networks.10,11,12,13,14,15

The mechanical behavior of semiﬂexible biopolymer net-
works has been subject to theoretical investigation since the
mid nineties.16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 Most studies focussed on the
small-strain deformations enabling analytical treatment. The
mechanics of these networks under strain is determined by the
mechanical properties of individual ﬁlamental constituents,
changes in network topography under deformation, and ﬁ-
nally, the molecular properties and dynamics of cross-binding
proteins. MacKintosh and co-workers developed a model
to describe the elasticity of biopolymer networks, in which

strain stiffening originates from longitudinal stiffening in in-
dividual semiﬂexible ﬁlaments.16 Filamental stiffening is at-
tributed to entropic effects, originating from the dynamic in-
teractions with the surrounding (cytoplasmic) ﬂuid.16,24,25,26
Next, Storm et al. developed a continuum model by insert-
ing this single-ﬁlament force-extension relation in a network
of inﬁnitely many, randomly oriented ﬁlaments.22 Under an
applied shear, the network is then assumed to deform in an
afﬁne manner, allowing for an analytical description of the
overall nonlinear network response.

Under the afﬁne-deformation assumption, used in network
models describing rubber elasticity,27 strain stiffening of the
network directly results from stiffening in individual ﬁla-
ments. The validity of the afﬁnity assumption adopted by
Storm et al.22 was studied in detail by Head et al.17,18 and by
Wilhelm and Frey19 for straight ﬁlaments. Numerical calcula-
tions in the small-strain limit show that network distortions are
indeed afﬁne for high density, highly cross-linked networks,
but are nonafﬁne for low- and intermediate-density networks.
In a recent publication we have reported on strain stiffening
in two-dimensional (2D) cross-linked biopolymer networks
comprising discrete ﬁlaments, analyzed by the ﬁnite-element
method.28 With the aid of this novel approach, the network
response was calculated up to large strains for various ﬁla-
ment densities, and we showed that the origin of stiffening
lies in the network rather than in its constituents. In this dis-
crete ﬁlament model strain stiffening results from nonafﬁne
network reorientations that induce a transition from a (rela-
tively soft) bending-dominated response at small strains to a
(stiff) stretching dominated response at large strains. Next to
initially straight ﬁlaments, we studied networks of initially un-
dulated ﬁlaments as if instantaneous thermal undulations are
frozen in, and found that these merely postpone the onset of
the stiffening.

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The
afﬁne-network (AN) model accounts for the dynamic inter-
action with the surrounding ﬂuid during pulling, but neglects
any network rearrangements, while the discrete-network (DN)
model accounts for the latter, but ignores the former. The aim
of this article is to rigorously investigate the relative contri-
bution of both effects on the overall stiffening by a detailed
comparison of both approaches.

In Sect.

This article is organized as follows.

II we will
determine the undulated shape of 2D semiﬂexible ﬁlaments
resulting from the interaction with the surrounding ﬂuid and
will investigate the distribution of slack (the relative displace-
ment of the ends to reach a straight conﬁguration). Subse-
quently, in Sect. III we will study the mechanical behavior of
extensible and inextensible semiﬂexible ﬁlaments under ten-
sion. We will in detail compare the ensemble-averaged force-
extension relation of individual, inextensible ﬁlaments with
and without undulation dynamics taken into account (to be
referred to as the dynamic and static response, respectively)
and show that the average mechanical response is rather simi-
lar. In addition, we will investigate the average static and dy-
namic force-extension relations in case of extensible ﬁlaments
and show that the mechanical response is largely determined
by the enthalpic stretching contribution, as conﬁrmed by dis-
crete ﬁnite-element calculations. Finally, in Sect. IV we will
develop an analytical model describing the afﬁne, mechanical
behavior of 2D biopolymer networks under simple shear. As
input, the model uses the average force-extension relation of
individual ﬁlaments determined in Sect. III. Results will be
compared with the discrete network model and we will show
that nonafﬁne local network reorientations, that are not taken
into account in the analytical model, play a key role in the
onset of stiffening, especially at lower densities.

II. SEMIFLEXIBLE FILAMENTS: SHAPE AND
THERMAL UNDULATIONS

The shape of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments such as F-actin is ther-
mally perturbed by collisions with cytoplasmic molecules.
The resistance of polymer chains to such thermal forces is
characterized by their persistence length LP, the characteris-
tic arc length above which the ﬁlaments’ tangent becomes un-
correlated. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a snapshot of a 2D
thermally undulated ﬁlament of contour length LC, parame-
terized by the arc length s and having a tangent angle q (s).

Mathematically, the persistence length follows from the av-
erage cosine of q (s)
q (0) in a ﬁlament over time or, alter-
natively, over all ﬁlaments in the ensemble at a speciﬁc time.
For 2D ﬁlaments this average decays exponentially with arc
length s as29

with the persistence length deﬁned by

.

In Eq. (2), kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the temperature,
and k f is the ﬂexural rigidity. While biopolymers such as DNA
LC, we here focus on semi-
are ﬂexible polymers with LP
≪
ﬂexible ﬁlaments (e.g. actin, vimentin, keratin and ﬁbrin) that
have a persistence length similar to their contour length. De-
tails on the values of LP and k f used for the calculations in this
article can be found in Appendix A.

In general, the undulated shape of ﬁlaments can be ex-
pressed by a superposition of N Fourier modes for the tangent
angle q (s):29,30,31

Two-dimensional, undulated ﬁlaments can thus be mimicked

III. THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC MECHANICAL
BEHAVIOR OF SEMIFLEXIBLE FILAMENTS

has an average value of 8.1 % for these ﬁlaments. To inves-
tigate the dependence of v on the number of terms N in the
Fourier series, we plot the relative slack probability density
function p(v ) for N = 3, 10 and 100 in Fig. 3. It can be seen
that the distribution shifts to larger v
for larger values of N.
However, no signiﬁcant difference is found between the dis-
tribution functions for N = 10 and 100.

In this section we study the mechanical response of individual
semiﬂexible ﬁlaments subjected to a tensile load. As men-
tioned in Sect. I, this behavior depends on whether the un-
dulation dynamics is taken into account. In addition, we in-
vestigate the enthalpic contribution of stretching in extensible
ﬁlaments.

We start by investigating the purely static34 mechanical be-
havior of originally undulated, inextensible ﬁlaments. In the
absence of an externally applied force, the chain in an undu-
lated conﬁguration is characterized by the set of amplitudes
a0
, as descibed in Sect. II. Next, the chain is subjected to
n}
{
a tensile force fc along its end-to-end direction (the x-axis in
Fig. 2), which induces a bending moment that tends to ﬂat-
ten out the ﬁlament. As a result, the conﬁgurational state will
with a decrease in the absolute value of
change to
each mode amplitude, i.e.,
. Describing the

The dependence of each mode amplitude on the applied force
can be calculated using the beam equation as follows. For an
external force fc , the induced bending moment at a point s
along the contour is given by fcy(s; fc), which has to be equal
to the bending moment corresponding to the curvature of the
ﬁlament, i.e.,

fcy(s; fc) = k f

.

(12)

Substitution of Eq. (3) (using an( fc) instead of a0
Eq. (11) into Eq. (12) results in

By increasing the external force from fc to fc + d fc, mode
amplitudes change to an + dan. We can then apply Eq. (13)
to ﬁnd a linear, ﬁrst-order differential equation for each mode
amplitude an( fc):

increases and the ﬁlament becomes (close to being) straight

is identical, since this behavior is then dominated by internal
bending. However, as the ﬁlament straightens, the force in-
creases and the ﬁlament extends due to its nonzero compliance
(i.e., ﬁnite stretching stiffness). For u/x
1.0, the mechan-
ical response of the ﬁlament gradually becomes linear with a
stiffness d fc/du approaching m /LC.35 As a check, the force-
extension relation was also calculated numerically by dividing
the ﬁlament into 500 Euler-Bernoulli beam elements of equal
length (see reference 28 for details); the force-extension curves
in Fig. 4 were reproduced to within 2%.

Now that we have determined the characteristics of the ini-
tial shape of an individual ﬁlament and its mechanical re-
sponse to an externally applied tensile force, we can deter-
mine the ensemble-averaged force-extension relation of inex-
tensible ﬁlaments. In the static approach adopted so far, the
interaction of chains with the surrounding ﬂuid is taken into
account only via their initial, undulated conﬁgurational state,
as can be seen from Eq. (17). The chain’s initial free energy
is given by the Hamiltonian

These results can be directly compared with the results
derived by MacKintosh and coworkers.16 In their entropic
model, ﬁlaments continually undergo thermal bending mo-
tions as they are subjected to an external tensile force. At
each instance and applied force the conﬁgurational state of
the ﬁlament changes, as a result of the interaction with the
surrounding ﬂuid. In this dynamic model, each mode ampli-
tude changes in time and with force, i.e., an = an(t; fc). The
free-energy functional of the ﬁlament is written as16

The equality of the slack distance in both models is sim-
ply due to the fact that, in the absence of an external force,
the Hamiltonian used in the dynamic model, Eq. (27), reduces
to the bending energy, Eq. (20), that is also used for equipar-
tition in the static model. However, as soon as the chain is
subjected to a tensile force (no matter how small in magni-
tude), the static and dynamic mechanical responses deviate.
This deviation is caused by the difference in the chain’s en-
ergy used for equipartition. In the static model, only the initial
undulations are taken into account by equipartition at fc = 0.
Next, each frozen-in ﬁlament is subjected to a tensile force,
thereby reducing the internal bending energy of the system.
In the dynamic model, equipartition is imposed on the total

free-energy functional, comprising both the bending energy
and the chain’s work of contracting against the applied force:
on average each harmonic mode in the chain’s total internal
energy remains kBT /2 during pulling, even though its bend-
ing component reduces. At each force, there must therefore be
sufﬁcient time for a complete energy redistribution between
different bending modes and between the bending and tension
energies, to ensure that the chain’s energy [Eq. (27)] remains
constant. Compared to static ﬁlaments, a larger force is re-
quired to reach a certain end-to-end distance in order to over-
come the effect of dynamic undulations, thus resulting in a
higher stiffness.

Since energy is the origin of the difference in static and
dynamic mechanical response, it is of interest to study the ex-

stiffness ratio. Compared to static chains, the energy needed
to extend dynamically undulating chains close to their contour
length is about four times larger. In both cases, however, the
completely straight conﬁguration will never be reached as a
result of the energy divergence.

The origin of this divergence is different in the two models
and can be explained by allowing thermal bending motions to
excite only the ﬁrst order mode a1 in the Fourier series (3).

and, thus, is equal to the average initial energy stored in bend-

be stretched to their contour length by an energy input equal
to the initially stored bending energy. The origin of the en-
ergy divergence for static chains is merely the result of allow-
ing an inﬁnitely large number of bending conﬁgurations in the
Fourier series (N

and diverges. This is a result of the fact that equipartition is
applied on the total free-energy functional [Eq. (27)]. Hence,
dynamic chains can never be pulled straight completely, even
if only a single bending mode is allowed.

where dl/ds is the relative length change along the ﬁlament
and D LC the total increase in contour length. Equation (35) de-
termines the Hookean response of the ﬁlament with a stretch-
ing stiffness m . The ensemble-averaged mechanical behav-
ior of such ﬁlaments can be found by applying Eq. (19) to
Eq. (22) for static chains and to Eq. (29) for dynamic chains.
The results are shown in the inset of Fig. 5, with m = 16 N. As
approaches LC, the mechanical response is clearly domi-

nated by axial stretching of the ﬁlaments. The energy stored
in stretching dominates the total energy and the deviation be-
tween the dynamic and static model vanishes around
= LC.
This can be shown even better by studying the dynamic-to-
static stiffness and work ratios for extensible ﬁlaments, that
are also shown in Fig. 6 (dotted and dash-dotted curves, re-
spectively). While following the curves for inextensible ﬁla-
ments at small end-to-end displacements (bending-dominated
regime), both ratios decrease to one around
= LC, where
the stretching-dominated regime starts.

The stiffening of individual ﬁlaments cannot be easily over-
estimated:
the average axial stiffness increases from Gb =
7.7 N/m for static ﬁlaments, Eq. (25), or Gb = 15.4 N/m
for dynamic ﬁlaments, Eq. (32), in the bending-dominated
regime, to a value of Gs = m /LC = 1.6
106 N/m in the
stretching-dominated regime. Since Gb is six orders of mag-
nitude smaller than Gs, we will neglect from now on the en-
tropic, axial stiffness due to internal bending. For an individ-
ual ﬁlament with a slack distance x , the dependence of the
axial stiffness on the end-to-end displacement u is thus ap-
proximated by

It is important to note the difference in averaging procedures

The average stiffness,

(u; 10 m m; 10 m m) according to

the average stiffness gradually increases from 0 for small dis-
placements to a saturation value of m /LC for large displace-
ments. This enthalpic stiffening thus results from an increase
in the number of ﬁlaments that are stretched beyond their
slack distance. The corresponding average force-extension re-
lation is shown in Fig. 7(b) [solid circles].

To investigate and check the mechanical response found in
the analytical model, we have performed 2D ﬁnite-element
(FE) calculations on individual ﬁlaments (m = 16 N, k f =
17 Nm2). Filaments were generated as described
8.53
in Section II using Eqs. (3) and (4) with LP = LC = 10 m m,
ﬁxed at one end and pulled by prescribing the displacement
of the other end along the direction of the initial end-to-end
vector. The force-extension relation was calculated for 2000
randomly generated ﬁlaments, from which the ensemble-
averaged response was determined by averaging the force
at constant displacement; the stiffness was computed from
d
/du. The results are shown by the solid curves in Fig. 7.
As can be seen, the FE-predictions correspond very well with
the analytical model. What cannot be seen, because of the
plotting scale, is that the initial average stiffness is 102 N/m
instead of the value 7.7 N/m calculated from Eq. (25). This

IV. AFFINE MODEL FOR ELASTICITY IN
SEMIFLEXIBLE BIOPOLYMER NETWORKS

The ensemble-averaged force-extension relation of individ-
ual ﬁlaments derived in Sect. III, enables us to calculate the
mechanical response of cross-linked networks of such ﬁla-
ments under simple shear. To do so, we follow the procedure
used by Wu and Van der Giessen for the elasticity of rubber
networks.27,39

We consider a square unit cell of dimension W spanned by
base vectors e1 and e2 as indicated in Fig. 8(a). In the ini-

The area rw covered by the ﬁlament is, on average, constant under
the assumption that the network is incompressible.

tial state, the unit cell contains Nf ﬁlaments of length LC =
LP = 10 m m, at random orientations. The areal and line den-
sity of ﬁlaments in the network are deﬁned as n = Nf/W 2 and
r = nLC, respectively. The angle between the initial ﬁlament’s
end-to end-vector r0 = r0m0 and e1 is denoted by F

Next, the cell is subjected to a simple shear of strain G
,
by ﬁxing the lower boundary and displacing the top boundary
over a distance W G
, see Fig. 8(a). This deformation process
is represented by the deformation gradient tensor F with com-
ponents

Note that the shear deformation process satisﬁes detF = 1, ex-
pressing incompressibility of the ﬁlamental network.40 When
it is assumed that the ﬁlaments deform in an afﬁne manner,
each ﬁlament’s end-to-end vector r0 transforms to the vec-
tor r = rm according to r = Fr0, as sketched in Fig. 8(a).
Filaments thus rotate from F
to f and undergo a stretch of

also known as the “chain orientation distribution function”
(CODF).27,39 Figure 10 shows a polar plot of the CODF for
G = 0 and 0.30 in the angular range [0, 2p ].42 For G = 0 there
is no deformation and ﬁlaments are randomly distributed in
the network, indicated by the spherical distribution. As the
network deforms, ﬁlaments rotate in the straining direction,
resulting in a nonspherical distribution, its anisotropy grow-
ing with increasing strain. For G = 0.3 the principal directions
for which a minumum and maximum stretch is obtained, are
indicated by the mutually orthogonal, straight dashed lines.
For this strain, ﬁlaments at an angle of f = 40.7◦undergo a
maximum stretch of l = 1.16 and ﬁlaments at an angle of
f =

49.3◦ a maximum compression (l = 0.86).
Under the assumption of afﬁne deformation,

the Eqs.
(36,37,38,41,42) can be used to calculate the network re-
sponse to simple shear. We start by considering an individ-
ual ﬁlament at an angle f subjected to a stretch l (f , G ) in the
deformed unit cell of strain G
, as sketched in Fig. 8(b). As-
suming the network is incompressible, the area per chain, rw,
remains constant, and is thus equal to 1/n. The force acting

−

on the ﬁlament, fc, can be tranformed to the Cauchy traction
s c acting on the continuum in which the ﬁlament is embed-
ded, s c = fc/(bw), where w is the cross-sectional width and
b is the unit out-of-plane length the force acts on. Similar
to the approach by Wu and Van der Giessen39 we deﬁne the
micro-stress tensor sss c by

sss c = s c (m

m)

pI,

⊗

−

(43)

with s c = nl (f ; G ) fcr0b−
1 since r = l r0. In Eq. (43) the hy-
drostatic stress p is included to account for the incompressibil-
ity of the network. The micro-stress tensor is the contribution
of a single ﬁlament oriented along m(f ) to the stress of the
network. Finally, with the areal density of chains dn having
an orientation between f and f + df given by

dn = nC(f ; G )df ,

(44)

the overall or macro-stress tensor sss of the network can be
evaluated by the average of the micro-stress tensor sss c over
the individual chains in the network, i.e.,

sss =

1

sss cdn.

(45)

Z
It is important to note here that since the force acting
on an individual ﬁlament depends on its end-to-end dis-
placement, it therefore depends on its current orientation f
and applied shear strain G
through fc(f ; G ) = fc(u(f ; G )) =
fc(r0(l (f ; G )

stretch and compress upon mechanical loading, but do not

ternal bending can also be neglected, and that axial stretching

ﬁlament force-extension relation. The angular region in which

responding shear stiffness, G = dt /dG
, is shown in Fig. 11(b).
As can be seen, stiffening of the network is indeed observed,
resulting from the average stiffening of individual ﬁlaments
in the network (Fig. 7), or said differently, stiffening results
from an increase in the fraction of ﬁlaments that are stretched
beyond their slack distance.

These results can be directly compared to 2D numerical
discrete-network (DN) calculations using the ﬁnite-element
method.28 Filaments of contour length LC and persistence
length LP are randomly placed into a square cell of dimen-
sion W at random orientations, with proper account of period-
icity. Each ﬁlament is discretized into 15 equal-sized, Euler-
Bernoulli beam elements that account for stretching (with ax-
ial stiffness m ) and bending (with stiffness k f). In accordance
with Sect. II, 10 Fourier modes are used to describe the ini-
tial shape of the undulated ﬁlaments. The points were ﬁl-
aments overlap are considered to be stiff cross-links, where
the rotation and the displacement of the two ﬁlaments at the
cross-link is equal. Figure 12(a) shows an example of a ran-
domly generated network of density r = 13 that is in its initial,
stress-free conﬁguration. Filaments crossing either the upper
or lower boundary of the cell are perfectly bonded to rigid
top and bottom plates, respectively. Next, the top plate is dis-
placed horizontally relative to the bottom plate over a distance
G W , corresponding to an applied shear strain of G
. Geometry
changes are accounted for by an updated Lagrangian ﬁnite-
strain formulation. Figures 12(b) and (c) show the network
of Fig. 12(a) in the deformed state at shears of G =0.125 and
0.285, respectively. The macroscopic shear stress t
is calcu-
lated from the cumulative, horizontal reaction force of nodes

studies were performed to ensure that the results are not af-
fected by the number of elements per ﬁlament and the cell
size W .

The stress-strain response (averaged over 10 different,
random realizations) at three network ﬁlament densities of
r =13, 25 and 38 is included in Figure 11 (solid curves). It
can be seen that, at a relatively small density (r =13), the
discrete-network (DN) calculations result in a much softer
response compared to the afﬁne-network (AN) calculations.
Closer examination of the DN results reveals, ﬁrst, that the
small-strain mechanical response is dominated by bending
and buckling of ﬁlaments,28 thus yielding a soft response.
Second, at somewhat larger strains, ﬁlaments perform addi-
tional, nonafﬁne motions during shearing: ﬁlaments reori-
ent themselves in the direction of straining by rotations and
translations. These nonafﬁne, geometrical network reorien-
tations can be clearly seen by comparison of Fig. 12(b) with
Fig. 12(a). Both effects, bending/buckling of ﬁlaments and
local network reorientations, are not taken into account in the
AN model, where instead, at small strains, all ﬁlaments with
an orientation between 0 and p /2 are subjected to stretch.
The response in the AN model is therefore dominated by
stretching of ﬁlaments, contrary to what is observed in the
DN computations. However, as the strain increases, more ﬁl-
aments become oriented in the direction of straining, as seen
in Fig. 12(c): strings of stretched ﬁlaments connect the top
and bottom plate of the cell. Thus, at larger strains, the re-

sponse according to the DN calculations is also dominated
by stretching of ﬁlaments, which explains the stiffening in
the DN curves in Fig. 11 at low densities. Since the relative
amount of ﬁlaments in stretching remains small compared to
that of the AN model, the stiffness determined from the DN
calculations remains small compared to the stiffness from the
AN model (black curves in Fig. 11).

In contrast to small densities, at larger densities (e.g., r =
38) the DN calculations exhibit a higher stiffness compared to
the AN calculations (red curves in Fig. 11). The reason for this
is that the cross-link density increases with ﬁlament density,
with two effects. First, the higher cross-link density results in

a more rigid network structure in which each ﬁlament is cross-
linked to more ﬁlaments, thereby decreasing the freedom of
ﬁlaments to undergo nonafﬁne reorientations. The transition
from a bending-dominated regime to a stretching-dominated
regime therefore shifts to smaller strains as can be seen by
comparing the solid DN curves in Fig. 11. Second, chain seg-
ments between cross-links contain less slack than the original
ﬁlaments: segments are thus stretched beyond their slack dis-
tance at smaller strains leading to a higher stiffness. In the AN
model, this reduction in slack is not taken into account, but
cross-links are assumed to be at the ends of the ﬁlament, in-
dependent of the density of ﬁlaments in the network. Density
enters the AN model only through the prefactor in Eq. (46),
which explains the (self-) similar shape of the AN curves in
Fig. 11.

Eq. (47) thus gives the limiting, afﬁne mechanical behav-
ior of biopolymer networks of high density. Whether or not
ﬁlaments are undulated and contain slack is not relevant at
this point, since the segments of average length lc
LC are
straight at high densities [see inset Fig. (13)]. As we showed
before, the DN calculations exhibited nonafﬁne deformation
characteristics at low densities. However, at higher densities
the DN calculations are also expected to show an afﬁne be-
havior. To check this, we have investigated the initial, small-
strain network stiffness, G0, as a function the density r , see
Fig. 15 (solid squares). The afﬁne value follows directly from
the derivative of Eq. (47) by a ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion of

at small strains ﬁlamental segments are stretched beyond their
slack distance resulting in a higher stress and stiffness. Af-
ter the density correction, all AN calculations exhibit a higher
stiffness than the DN calculations, irrespective of the density:
as said before, this can be attributed to nonafﬁne network de-
formations (bending/buckling, local network reorientations)
in the DN calculations that are not taken into account in the
AN model.

In calculating the density-corrected response, the angular
integration was performed in the interval [0, arctan(2G −
1)],
see Eq. (46), assuming that segments still contain a consid-
erable amount of slack, resulting in a very compliant response
in case such a segment is under axial compression. How-
ever, as discussed above, when the ﬁlament density increases,
segments between cross-links become shorter and virtually
straight. For a network consisting of only straight ﬁlaments,
segments under compression exhibit the same axial stiffness

Finally, it is interesting to see that in the networks’ stretch-
ing regime, i.e., at large strains, the network stiffness (both
AN and DN) continues to increase despite the fact that the
individual segments have a constant axial stiffness m /lc in
stretching [see Fig. 14(b)]. From this one would expect the
stiffness to converge to a ﬁxed ’steady-state’ value. However,
due to nonlinear geometrical effects at large strains, the stiff-
ness increases with straining according to

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have performed a detailed investigation of the mechan-
ical stiffening behavior of 2D semiﬂexible biopolymer ﬁla-
ments and networks of such ﬁlaments under simple shear.
Such polymers undergo thermally excited bending motions,
brought about by collisions with molecules of the surround-
ing ﬂuid in which the ﬁlament is immersed. For inextensible
ﬁlaments subjected to a tensile force, these undulations can
be pulled out at the cost of an external energy input, result-
ing in an axial stiffness that can be calculated for two speciﬁc
cases. First, we can assume no undulation dynamics to take
place during tension. In this case, the ﬁlament is isolated from
its surrounding ﬂuid and the random, undulated state present
in the ﬁlament is subsequently pulled out when subjected to a
tensile force. In this static case, the axial stiffness results from
internal bending with bending stiffness k f; using equilibrium
mechanics, the force-extension relation can be calculated and
averaged over an ensemble of ﬁlaments. Second, undulation
dynamics can be taken into account during pulling. By apply-
ing equipartition on the ﬁlament’s total energy functional at
each force, the ensemble-averaged, dynamic force-extension
relation can be derived. This so-called entropic stiffening was
previously derived by MacKintosh and coworkers.16

The resulting average mechanical response of single ﬁla-
ments in these two cases turns out to be very similar. At
small forces and end-to-end displacements, both responses
scale with k 2
f , with the initial dynamic stiffness being a factor
2 larger than the static one. Close to full stretching, as the av-
approaches the contour length LC,

teristic for the worm-like chain model, with the dynamic/static
stiffness ratio approaching 4. This indicates that the static and
dynamic approaches are qualitatively very similar, capturing
the same physical dependence on the mechanical and geomet-
rical parameters k f, LP and LC, but differ quantitatively by a
factor 2 to 4.

In case of extensible ﬁlaments of stretching stiffness m , en-
thalpic axial elongation dominates the ﬁlaments’ mechanical
behavior close to full stretching and both models thus exhibit a

13

quantitatively identical mechanical response. In addition, we
have shown that for 2D ﬁlaments, one can very well describe
the ensemble-averaged force-extension relation by completely
neglecting contributions from internal bending and by merely
taking into account the axial stretching of ﬁlaments and the
distribution in slack.

Two-dimensional, cross-linked networks that have these
semiﬂexible ﬁlaments as building blocks stiffen under an ap-
plied shear strain. Often, stiffening is attributed to the en-
tropic stiffening of individual ﬁlaments undergoing afﬁne de-
formations. For the 2D networks under investigation, we con-
clude by comparing analytical, afﬁne network (AN) calcula-
tions with discrete (ﬁnite-element) network (DN) calculations
that this cannot be the case. For networks of low ﬁlament
density, the mean cross-link distance lc is relatively large and
the resulting segments between cross-links contain a relatively
large amount of slack that can be pulled out. In this case, one
could argue that entropic stiffening would be the main ori-
gin of stiffening. However, the DN calculations show that at
these densities stiffening lies in the network rather than in its
constituents: at small strains the mechanical response is dom-
inated by bending/buckling of ﬁlaments and nonafﬁne rota-
tions and translations. These local network rearrangements
induce a transition from a bending-dominated regime at small
strains to a stretching-dominated regime at larger strains in
which strings of connected ﬁlaments dominate the mechanical
response. At higher network densities, the number of cross-
links increases and the mean cross-link distance lc decreases,
so that the shorter segments between cross-links contain less
slack. The higher network density then results in a mechani-
cal response that is more afﬁne in nature, with the mentioned
reduction in slack increasing the enthalpic stretching contri-
bution of the segments. By accounting for the reduced slack
in the AN calculations, the DN results were severely over-
estimated, showing that, for the densities investigated, the
discrete-network architecture plays a key role. Only in the
limit of extremely high densities do the DN and reduced-slack
AN calculations coincide.

Hence, we conclude that, for physiological relevant densi-
ties, stiffening in 2D networks results from nonlinearities in
the network response, rather than from entropic stiffening of
individual ﬁlaments. Note that these conclusions might be
different for three-dimensional networks, since the amount of
slack in ﬁlaments is signiﬁcantly higher than in 2D. Current
work focuses on this issue in 3D networks.

While real semiﬂexible ﬁlaments are, evidently,
dimensional objects that are often idealized as rods of diame-
ter d, 2D models require some ’projected’ thickness t for the
speciﬁcation of the axial and the ﬂexural stiffness in terms of
Young’s modulus E, the area of a ﬁlament’s cross section, A,
and its second moment of inertia, I. This ’projection’, how-
ever, is not trivial nor unique. While the moment of inertia of
a circular cross-section of diameter d is I = p d4/64, that of
a projected ﬁlament with thickness t is I = bt3/12 with some
out-of-plane width b. Aiming at actin ﬁlaments which typi-
cally have a diameter of d = 8 nm, we use 2D ﬁlaments with
t = 8 nm. When a typical value of E = 2 GPa is used for the
Young’s modulus of actin, the bending stiffness k f of such 2D
ﬁlaments with a unit out-of-plane thickness (i.e., b = 1 m) is

k f in the beam-equation [Eq. (12)] we use the value calculated

Appendix D

We consider a ‘network’ consisting of parallel ﬁlament strings
that are initially normal to the plane of shear, separated by a
distance H [see dashed lines in sketch(a)]. The strings have
a stretching stiffness m and connect the top and bottom plates
separated by a distance W . Next, the network is subjected to
a shear of strain G by displacing the top plate by a distance
u. Strings rotate by an angle b = arctan (G ) and undergo a
stretch, leading to a certain shear stress t . The instantenous
stiffness G can be found by increasing the top-plate displace-
ment from u to u + D u [see sketch(b)] corresponding to a in-
crease D
in strain and resulting in an increase D
in stress.
Using a unit out-of-plane dimension, the shear stiffness is de-
ﬁned as

calculations. We will show, however, that the shape of a ﬁlament
can be described well by N-values on the order of ten.

→

32 As can be seen from Fig. 2 the ﬁlament does not exactly end on
the x-axis due to the approximation made in Eq. (6). Therefore,
the (small) value of y(LC) is also taken into account in calculating
the end-to end distance.

34 The adjective ‘static’ here signiﬁes that only the initial, undulated
conﬁguration is taken into account (no undulation dynamics).
35 This follows directly from Eq. (19): close to full stretching r ap-

proaches LC, resulting in rm

40 An initial volume element dV subjected to a deformation pro-
cess characterized by the strain gradient tensor F, changes its vol-
ume to dV ′ = det F dV . Volume conservation is thus expressed by
det F = 1.

41 This is similar to the general expression of the chain-orientation-
distribution-function (CODF) in three dimensions (with spheri-
cal angles q and f ) which reads C(q , f ; F) = C0l 3(q , f ; F) with
C0 = 1/(4p ), as derived by Wu and Van der Giessen.27,39

42 Note that the CODF is a periodic function of period p . Therefore
the normalization in Eq. (42) is done over an angular range of p ,
p /2, p /2] or [0, p ], but the CODF is plotted here over the
e.g. [
whole angular range of 2p .

43 This limiting value can be obtained by considering Nf straight ﬁl-
aments of length LC, oriented at random angles a with the x-axis,
in a square cell of dimension W . The probability of a ﬁlament
intersecting the x-axis is simply (LC/W ) sin a
. The probability
of this ﬁlament intersecting a ﬁlament aligned with the x-axis
is thus (LC/W )2 sin a
. The average cross-link probability can be

17

found by averaging over the angle a and results in 2L2
C/(p W 2).
In the high-density limit, the mean number of cross-links per
ﬁlament, LC/lc, is simply the product of the average cross-link
C/(p W 2). Using
probability and number of ﬁlaments, i.e., 2NfL2
r = NfLC/W 2, this results in the high-density limit r lc = p /2.44

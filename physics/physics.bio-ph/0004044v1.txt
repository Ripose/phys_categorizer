Abstract

Biological systems are among the most challenging subjects for theoretical physicists,
as well as experimentalists or simulationists. Physical principles should have been both
constraints and guide-lines for the evolution of living systems over billions of years. One
generally aims at clarifying what physical principles, possibly new ones, are behind the
phenomena of biological interest and at understanding how they work within the entire
biological world. In the present talk we describe an example of such an eﬀort.

Since the discovery of ‘superprecipitation’ by Szent-Gyorgyi’s group in 1940’s, it has
been a long puzzle how an assemblage of actin ﬁlaments with random orientation can
contract in the presence of the two-headed myosin molecules undergoing actin-activated
ATP-hydrolysis reaction. It is widely accepted that during the contraction the two-headed
myosin mediates the relative sliding of two actin ﬁlaments whose polarity directions are not
parallel but rather anti-parallel. But this fact solely does not account for the shortening.
We propose a dynamical model which, upon numerical simulation, exhibits the shortening
of an bundle of the actin ﬁlaments which are initially dirstributed randomly both in space
along a line and in polarity direction.
In the course of shortening several clusters of
actins appears along the bundle. The model also shows the sorting of the actin ﬁlaments
according to their polarity in the late stage. These ﬁndings are in accordance with the
recent experiment by Takiguchi.

1 Introduction

There is much interest in biological systems from a physicists point of view by several

reasons. First, by looking at the diversity and hierarchy of biological phenomena and at

the billions of years of their evolution, it is a challenge to unveil universal phenomena

or universal origins of those systems based on physical principles. For instance, ATP

(adenosine triphosphate) is often described in biology textbook as the energy source [energy

donner], as the substrate of transferase [phosphate donner], and as the substrate of allosteric

enzyme [regulation factor]. We are, however, tempted to search more uniﬁed view of the role

of ATP since it should have appeared on the earth initially bearing a single role. Secondly,

the biological systems are the very representatives of complex systems. By regarding them

as systems of active elements we are inspired with many physical ideas and models.

If we view the subjects of biology which have become also the subjects of physicists,

we ﬁnd that there are some frameworks elaborately introduced so that physicists can de-

velop their idea upon it. Protein folding is studied based upon the Anﬁnsen’s dogma that

(most) natural proteins rest in their equilibrium folded states. Neural network, despite the

prohibiting complexity in reality, is studied based upon mathematical realization of Hebb’s

hypothesis. Fluctuating membrane is studied on the basis of elasticity theory including

entropic or Helfrich interaction, and molecular evolution is studied as stochastic process.

Morphogenesis and pattern formation have been studied in the framework of bifurcation

theory, etc. Protein dynamics can be one of the near future target of physicists, being

stimulated by the recent development and need of nanoscale handling of soft materials,

though the theoretical framework for it is not yet established.

It is said that the biological processes which appear to be purely physical phenomenon,

such as symmetry breakdown or instability are even sometimes coded explicitly on the DNA.

It should be, however, still meaningful to ask “how did such a biological process happen

to appear and become incorporated into evolutionary process?” Upon the appearance of

a new biological function, it should have been quite primitive and unsophisticated, which

works in barely eﬃcient way or in a poorly organized way. Exploring the mechanism of

such primitive functions should then be a subject of physics of biological interest as well

[1]. As such an example, we present in this paper how the system of random assemblage of

myosin and actin ﬁlaments (both being the constituent proteins of our muscle) can exhibit

stochastic contraction phenomena, which is recently studied experimentally in detail [2].

2 System of many myosins and actin ﬁlaments:

A paradox

We are considering the system consisting of myosins and actin ﬁlaments. Each myosin

has two globular heads (shown by the symbols like seed-leaves in Fig. 1), and each actin

ﬁlaments has its own polarity direction (indicated by the thin arrow lines in Fig. 1). If a

globular head of a myosin is within the reach of an actin ﬁlament in the presence of ATP,

the globular head consumes the hydrolysis energy of ATP to drive the actin ﬁlament to the

forward direction (indicated by the open thick arrow in Fig. 1(a)). The net relative motion

of actin ﬁlaments is brought by the action of a myosin only when the myosin is bound to

non-parallel pair of ﬁlaments (Fig. 1(c)), but not to parallel pair (Fig. 1(b)).

We focus here on the recent experiment by Takiguchi [2], He prepared a bundle of

many actin ﬁlaments which are assembled uniaxially but randomly with respect both to

their position and to their polarity direction. It has been demonstrated [2] that the bundle

3

of actin ﬁlaments undergoes longitudinal shortening in the presence of myosin and ATP

molecules. We will describe the experimental procedure of [2] in more detail. First a

long and thick bundle of many actin ﬁlaments is prepared in methyl cellulose aqueous

solution. To this bundle the two-headed myosins (so called heavy meromyosin, or HMM)

and an abundance of ATP molecules are added. The bundle then starts to contract slowly

in length, while it thickens so as to conserve its volume (Fig. 2). This shortening often

occurs in a wiggling way. After the bundle has shortened appreciably, several needle-like

subbundles appear from the main bundle. It has been shown that in these subbundles the

polarity of the actin ﬁlaments is not random but is oriented outward with respect to the

original bundle.

Experiment like this dates back to late 40’s, when Szent-Gyorgyi’s group discovered so

called superprecipitation, the phenomenon that a three-dimensional random assembly of

actin ﬁlaments and myosins shrinks dramatically after the addition of a certain amount of

ATP [3]. Such experiment has been recently also done and reﬁned [4]. Takiguchi’s setup [2]

may be regarded as a more idealized one to see how the contraction occurs. Such an ideal

random distribution is realized only in in vitro experiment, but the situations more or less

like this have been found in nature such as in the contractile rings that appear during the

mitotic period of cell division cycle [5] or in stress ﬁbers observed in the locomoting cells

during their contraction period [6, 7]. The experiments mentioned above, therefore, could

be regarded as a simulation of in vivo systems or, at least, as a hypothetical simulation

of evolutionally primitive stages of muscle contraction or cell motility. The question how

this primitive system undergoes shortening has, however, not been studied for a long time

since the discovery by Szent-Gyorgyi’s group. It is because the highly organized structure

of muscle was found [8] shortly after the former discovery, and the main stream of muscle

study has been focused towards a dynamics of single globular head of myosin and its

regulation mechanism [9].

It is Hatano who seriously questioned how the actin bundle can shorten in the prim-

itive situation like in Fig. 2, and he came across the following paradox [10]: When the

sliding of the oppositely oriented actin ﬁlaments starts from the state shown in Fig. 3(a),

the overlap between the two ﬁlaments would increase, leading to the shortening of the

bundle. On the other hand, when the sliding of the ﬁlaments starts from the state shown

in Fig. 3(b), the action of the myosin would decrease the overlap between the ﬁlaments,

4

leading to the elongation of the bundle. Since the both situations should occur equally

likely in a bundle, there would be no net shortening at all. In fact so-called bipolar kinesin,

the other motor protein closely related to myosin, is discovered to appear during the cell

division process and this protein is thought to act to separate the two spindle-poles by the

mechanism shown in Fig. 3(b) [11]. We would note that the above paradox cannot be lifted

by considering the eﬀect of simultaneous action of many myosins to an actin ﬁlament, as

it occurs experimentally as far as we assume the continuous action of myosin molecules on

the actin ﬁlaments, while such model could predict the undulational instability of ﬁlament

density [12].

3 Simple model and simulation

Our simple idea to resolve Hatano’s paradox is to take into account the ﬁnite distance,

say b, by which a globular head of myosin can continuously drive a single actin ﬁlament

(Fig. 3). The limitation of this distance may come from the dynamic ﬂuctuation of the

myosin heads as well as by the ﬂuctuation of the lateral arrangement of actin ﬁlaments

within a bundle. Our reasoning for the shortening is as follows: If the myosin acts in the

situation of Fig. 3(a) each globular head can translocate the respective ﬁlament fully by

the distance b on the average (hereafter we assume that b is suﬃciently smaller than the

length of each ﬁlament, which we denote by ℓ), while in the situation of Fig. 3(b) the

translocation of actions by myosin can be interrupted when one of its two heads meets

with the rear end of an actin ﬁlament. The elongation of the bundle to which the ﬁlaments

shown in Fig. 3(b) belong is, therefore, less extensive than the shrinking of the bundle

to which the ﬁlaments shown in Fig. 3(a) belong. The interruption of the elongation will

occur by the probability proportional to b/ℓ in the approximation up to the lowest order

of b/ℓ ≪ 1. The net shrinkage per each action of myosin will then be roughly scaled by

∼ b · b/ℓ if a single myosin acts to the pair of ﬁlaments. Actually the shortening by this

mechanism should be still less eﬃcient due to the presence of other myosins interacting

with those actin ﬁlaments. We believe, however, that the basic mechanism of shortening

may be captured by the present simple model.

We performed a numerical simulation based on the simple idea described in Fig. 3. The

algorithm of the simulation is as follows: First we distribute randomly N actin ﬁlaments of
the length ℓ over an interval − L0

2 along the x−axis. We choose the parameters so

that Nℓ ≫ L0 holds to assure substantial overlapping of the ﬁlaments along the x-axis. For

evolution, we deﬁne the ‘unitary action’ by a two-headed myosin: (1) We chose randomly a

spatial point, say at x = xM , where the myosin translocates a pair of actins (see (2) below).

(2) Among all the ﬁlaments that extend through the point x = xM we then choose randomly

a pair of anti-parallel actin ﬁlaments. One of the chosen ﬁlament is oriented toward the

positive x direction (i.e., rightward) and is centered at, say, x+, while the another chosen

ﬁlament is oriented toward the negative x direction (i.e., leftward) and is centered at, say,

x−. (3) We move these two ﬁlaments by the same distance but in the opposite direction,

according to the scheme described in Fig. 3. As seen from this ﬁgure the distance of sliding

is given by U(x+, x−, xM) ≡ Min[b, xM − x+ + ℓ/2, x− + ℓ/2 − xM]. (4) As for the rest of

the ﬁlaments in the bundle, those ﬁlaments in the region of x > xc(x+, x−) ≡ (x+ + x−)/2

6

are displaced by +U [−U] if x+ > x− [x+ < x−], respectively. Also, those ﬁlaments in the

region of x < xc(x+, x−) are displaced inversely so that U in the last sentence is replaced

by −U. The evolution of the system is obtained by applying this unitary action from (1)

to (4) repeatedly.

The result of the simulation is represented by the distribution of ﬁlaments position

(Figs. 4) and by the density of ﬁlaments along x-axis (Fig. 6). The parameters used there

are N = 200, ℓ = 0.25, and L0 = 50. These values are comparable to the experimental

values (in unit of µm for the lengths) [2]. The total time lapse of the evolution is such

that each ﬁlament undergoes, on the average, six times the unitary action of myosin.

These ﬁgures reveal the overall shortening of the assembly of ﬁlaments, and also shows the

clustering of the ﬁlaments in rather symmetric fashion with respect to their polarity. In

Fig. 5 we show another run with extended time lapse. There appear the ‘arms’ from both

ends of the bundle, which consist of ﬁlaments with unique outward polarities. The length

of these arms and the number of the ﬁlaments in these arms increase in time. Although the

simulation is restricted in one dimensional space, the characteristic features of the evolution

thus found are in agreement with experimental observation of (i) shortening of the main

bundle, (ii) inhomogenization of its thickness and (iii) generation of polar subbundles. [2].

4 Construction of continuum model

The above algorithm of simulation can be cast into the evolution equation for the densities

of actin ﬁlaments, ρ+(x+) and ρ−(x−), oriented rightward and leftward, respectively. For

this we needed to assume the smallness of the ratio, b/ℓ ≪ 1, and restrict ourselves to
the limit of weak spatial heterogeneity, |ρ′

±| ≪ ℓρ±. Suppose that a myosin is at x = xM
and starts to exert the unitary action to a pair of anti-parallel ﬁlaments. Let us denote by

P(x+, x−; xM)dx+dx− the probability that these two ﬁlaments are centered at x = x+ ∼

x+ + dx+ (the rightward ﬁlament) and at x = x− ∼ x− + dx− (the leftward ﬁlament),

respectively. In the mean ﬁeld approximation, this is given as

P(x+, x−; xM) =

where we introduced a step function θ(z) = 1 for z > 0 and θ(z) = 0 for z ≤ 0. Us-

ing this distribution we introduce the weighed average of any function, say O(x+, x−, xM),

over x+ and x− with xM being ﬁxed, < O >xM, as < O >xM ≡ R dx+R dx−P(x+, x−; xM)

7

O(x+, x−, xM). Then the displacement ﬁeld u(x; xM) of the actin densities caused by a

unitary action of myosin at xM is given by u(x, xM) = < U(x+, x−, xM) sgn(x+ − x−)

sgn(x−xc(x+, x−))>xM, where sgn(z) ≡ 2θ(z)−1. Using the gradient expansion of the den-
sities of actin ﬁlaments, ρ+(xM + X+)ρ−(xM + X−) ≃ ρ+(xM)ρ−(xM)+ ρ′

Here we have noted that sgn(x − xc(x+, x−)) can be safely replaced by sgn(x − xM) in the

coarse grained description which deals with only the length scales larger than ℓ. The zeroth

order term −b2/ℓ in the angular bracket represents the tendency of shortening described

already, and the second term represents the correction due to the spatial inhomogeneity
of the ﬁlament densities. If, for example, ρ′

− > 0 hold at x = xM, the latter
term predicts that the shortening is enhanced compared with the homogeneous case. It
is understandable since ρ′

− > 0 imply the situations like Fig. 3(a) is be more

+ < 0 and ρ′

+ < 0 and ρ′

likely to be found at xM than those like Fig. 3(b).

The mean drift velocity of the bundle, ¯v(x), is obtained as the integration of u(x, xM)

with respect to xM multiplied by the frequency factor κ(xM) with which myosins exert

the unitary actions per unit time and per unit interval along the x−axis. The evolution
equation for ρσ (σ = ±) is then ∂

∂x [¯v(x)ρσ]. Hereafter we the simplest choice
that the factor κ(xM) is an overall constant, say κ(xM) = κ0. This case is that one can

∂t ρσ = − ∂

solve the evolution equation analytically and, at the same time, that the essential feature of

shortening and clustering of the bundle is preserved (see below). Performing the integration

with respect to xM the evolution equation becomes;

Figure 7 shows two examples of the solution of (3), the one starting from the actin densities

with in-phase undulation (the left column) and the other one starting with anti-phase

8

undulation (the right column), respectively.

If we neglected the logarithmic correction

term in (3), the solution would simply represent the aﬃne contraction of the bundle, i.e.,
ρσ(x, t) = tc

tc−tx, 0(cid:17) for σ = ±, where tc = (2κ0b2/ℓ)−1L0 is the time at which

tc−tρσ(cid:16) tc

the bundle with the initial length of L0 shrinks down to a point. As seen from Fig. 7

the correction term acts to promote the clustering of actin ﬁlaments of both rightward

and leftward polarity. Two remarks are in order here: We should note that the simulation

described in the previous section, as well as the experiments with low myosin concentration,

would correspond to the slightly diﬀerent choice of κ(xM), that is, κ(xM) = κ0L0/L(t),
where L(t) is the total length of the bundle at time t. This overall factor, L(t)−1 would

change the time scale of the evolution of Fig. 7, but does not change the features of the

evolution of the density proﬁles. We would also note that the generation of the arm cannot

be handled within the present approximation in which the spatial variation of actin densities

is assumed to be small.

5 Summary

We have proposed a simple model for the of contraction of the random uniaxial assembly

of actin ﬁlaments, mediated by the two headed myosin molecules which translocates anti-

parallel actin ﬁlaments. Simulation result have agreed at least in the qualitative level with

the experimental observation: the shortening of the actin bundle, the clustering of density

and also the generation of polar arms. The experimental situation studied here may well

correspond to the stage of evolution where the collective transport by motor proteins had

ﬁrst come into existence in the biological world. More generally, it would be interesting

to study from physicists’ viewpoint how a function, in its most primitive form, has been

ﬁrst acquired by biological systems at any level of evolutionary history; the problem how

an allosteric enzyme have acquired the function to translocate the other molecule is a

challenging problem in this respect.

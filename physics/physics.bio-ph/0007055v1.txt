We investigate the relationship between the average ﬁtness de-
cay due to single mutations and the strength of epistatic interac-
tions in genetic sequences. We observe that epistatic interactions
between mutations are strongly correlated to the average ﬁtness
decay, both in RNA secondary structure prediction as well as in
digital organisms replicating in silico. This correlation implies that
during adaptation, epistasis and average mutational eﬀect cannot
be optimized independently. In experiments with RNA sequences
evolving on a neutral network, the selective pressure to decrease
the mutational load then leads to selection against sequences with
strong antagonistic interactions between deleterious mutations.

A thorough understanding of epistatic interactions of mutations in genomes
is becoming more and more crucial to many areas in population genetics and
evolutionary biology. Epistasis aﬀects linkage disequilibria [1, 2], robustness
to mutations [3] or “canalization” [4], as well as theories on the origin and
maintenance of sex [5, 6].
In particular, the sign of epistatic eﬀects, that
is, whether deleterious mutations are reinforcing (synergistic epistasis) or
mitigating (antagonistic epistasis) inﬂuence whether or not deleterious mu-
tations can accumulate in the genome via Muller’s ratchet [7]. The consensus
seems to be that synergistic epistasis can prevent the accumulation of muta-
tions [7]. On the other hand, the observation of compensatory mutations [8],
which also render the ratchet powerless, indicates epistasis, but not its sign.
While the genomes of a number of organisms have been examined for
signs of epistasis [9, 10, 11] no general trend can be discerned except to say
that interactions between mutations are frequent and of both signs, and that
synergistic epistasis seems to prevail in eukaryotic genomes while viral and
prokaryotic genomes show no preference. Experiments to measure epistatic
interactions are diﬃcult and usually yield results of weak statistical signiﬁ-
cance. Consequently, even epistasis of considerable strength can conceivably
be missed in vitro. Here, we investigate deleterious mutations in silico. In
particular, we show evidence that the strength of epistasis is correlated with
the average deleterious eﬀect of a single mutation, and that genomes with
strong antagonistic interactions are, on average, selected against in a scenario
which turns out to be quite general. Thus, selective pressures in the evolution
of genes seem to favor synergistic epistasis, and may provide a road towards
sexual recombination.

Neutrality and Epistasis

In a simple model of a multiplicative landscape, a mutation reduces the

ﬁtness on average by a factor 1 − s, so that for n mutations

w(n) = (1 − s)n

≡ e−αn ,

(1)

where we deﬁned α = − ln(1 − s). If the landscape is not perfectly multi-
plicative, i.e., if there exists a bias towards either antagonistic or synergistic
epistatic interactions, then this bias will naturally appear as deviations from
the exponential decay in (1). While these deviations have previously been
indicated by adding a term quadratic in n to the exponent of Eq. (1) [12], it
appears that realistic ﬁtness functions are better ﬁt [3] by the ansatz

w(n) = e−αnβ

,

(2)

where β = 1 means there is no bias towards either form of epistatic interac-
tions. A β > 1 indicates synergistic mutations prevail (mutations that are
on average “worth” more than one independent hit), while β < 1 reﬂects a
bias towards antagonistic mutations (mutations whose “damage” is less then
one independent mutation). Note that expression (2) is only an approxi-
mation for moderately small mutational distances n. Deviations from the
two-parameter ansatz may arise for larger n.

Naively, one might assume that the decay parameter α and the epistasis
parameter β are independent. Instead, we shall see that environments with
strong selection force a trade-oﬀ between α and β, so that one can only be
optimized at the expense of the other. The reasoning is as follows.
In a
strongly selective environment mutations can be classiﬁed as either neutral
or lethal; and w(n) can be thought of as the fraction of neutral sequences
in genetic space at mutational distance n.
In particular, the neutrality ν
of a sequence (the number of neutral one-mutants) is related to the decay
parameter by ν = ℓ(D − 1)e−α, where ℓ is the length of the sequence, and
D is the number of monomers.
If all sequences in genetic space have the
same ν, it follows that β = 1. A deviation from β = 1 implies that some
sequences have more or fewer neutral neighbors than others, giving rise to a
correlation between α and β. For a viable sequence with lower than average
neutrality (higher than average α), there are comparatively fewer sequences
close-by than there are far away, such that this sequence will have a small
β. Conversely, a sequence with a high neutrality (small α) will have com-
paratively more sequences close by, and β will be larger. We can make this

2

argument more formal with a simple “conservation law”, which only reﬂects
that the total number of neutral sequences in genetic space is constant. Since

for polymers of ﬁxed length ℓ made from D monomers there are (cid:0) ℓ

possible n-mutants, we must have

n(cid:1)(D − 1)n

ℓ

Xn=1

w(n)(cid:18)ℓ

n(cid:19)(D − 1)n = Nν ,

(3)

where Nν is the total number of neutral mutants of this wild type. Inserting
w(n) from Eq. (2) yields an implicit relation between α and β.

Although this argument strictly holds only under the assumption that
mutations are either neutral or lethal, it is reasonable to assume that a
similar (possibly weaker) correlation between α and β exists also in more
general cases, where slightly deleterious or even advantageous mutations are
possible.
In that case, under the presence of epistasis, there will still be
regions in genotype space in which the number of less-deleterious mutations
is higher, and other regions in which it is lower than average. The decay
function w(n) of a sequence from a region that is rich in non-lethal mutations
would have a higher α, but would be inevitably more synergistic than the
decay function of a sequence from a region poor in non-lethal mutations. Our
results on digital organisms (see below) support this reasoning.

Experimental Evidence

Accurate data for the decay parameter α and the epistasis parameter β
for biological organisms are rare, which makes our hypothesis diﬃcult to test
in vitro. A few well-studied systems have emerged which are accessible in
silico. Lenski et al. [3] have measured the decay of the mean ﬁtness in digital
organisms [13, 14], and determined α and β for 174 diﬀerent genomes. The
174 genomes consist of two groups of 87 genomes each. The ﬁrst group stems
from organisms evolved in 87 independent runs in a complex environment,
while the second group was obtained by allowing these organisms to evolve
further in a environment which favors simple genomes. A statistical anal-
ysis reveals a signiﬁcant correlation between the decay parameter and the
epistasis parameter for both the complex organisms and the simple organ-
isms (Table 1; see also Fig. 1.). However, in addition to said correlation,
we ﬁnd a correlation between the decay parameter and the genome length
ℓ for complex and simple organisms, and a correlation between the epistasis
parameter and the length in the case of the complex organisms. Hence, for

Table 1: The correlation r and p-value between decay parameter α, epistasis
parameter β and length ℓ in the data from Ref. [3]. The “Complex” and the
“Simple” data set consist each of 87 digital organisms, the “Reduced” data
set consists of all 48 organisms of length between 14 and 16 taken from the
“Simple” data set.

the complex organisms, we cannot dismiss the possibility that the correlation
between α and β merely reﬂects an underlying correlation of both quantities
with the length. In the case of the simple organisms, where we do not see
a correlation between β and the length, we can assume that the correlation
between α and β is genuine. To provide further evidence, we have examined
a reduced data set of all 48 simple organisms with a length between ℓ = 14
and ℓ = 16. In that data set, we ﬁnd an even stronger correlation between
α and β, while the correlation between either of the two quantities and the
length becomes insigniﬁcant (Table 1). It is not possible to study a similar
reduced data set for the complex organisms, because the variations in length
are too large (the length varies between ℓ = 20 and ℓ = 314 among the 87
genomes).

As a second test case, we have studied RNA secondary structure predic-
tion using the Vienna RNA package [15]. We have determined the decay of
the average number of neutral folds as a function of the Hamming distance
for 100 random RNA sequences of length ℓ = 76. A plot of β versus α
(Fig. 2) shows a signiﬁcant correlation as in the case of digital organisms,
with a correlation coeﬃcient of r = −0.817 (p < 0.01).

We can predict the relationship between α and β, according to Eq. (3),

if we compare the decay functions of sequences that are mutually neutral.
For RNA folding, this means we have to determine α and β for a set of
sequences that fold into the same structure. We have performed experiments
with the RNA sequences of length ℓ = 18 used in Ref. [16], which fold into
the structure depicted in Fig. 3. For the particular case that all bonds are of
the purine-pyrimidine type (G-C, G-U, A-U), two separate neutral networks
(a neutral network is a network of neutral genotypes connected to each other
by one-point mutations) were found in Ref. [16], consisting of 51,028 and
5,169 sequences, respectively. For each such set of neutral sequences, Eq. (3)
should predict the correlation without free parameter, as long as the number
of all neutral sequences Nν is known. A Monte Carlo estimate (see Methods)
yields Nν ≈ 7.5 × 106, which can be used to demonstrate convincingly (see
Fig. 4) that the correlation between α and β is indeed due to the conservation
law Eq. (3).

Figure 4: Epistasis parameter β versus the decay parameter α for sequences
on the larger of the two neutral networks of Ref. [16]. The solid line represents
the theoretical prediction, with an estimated N = 7.5 ×106 neutral sequences
in total.

Selection of Epistasis

The correlation between neutrality and epistasis implies that if one of
them is subject to selective pressures, the other will too. In Ref. [16], it was
shown that a population evolving on a neutral network reduces its genetic
load by moving into the regions of high neutrality in sequence space.
In
particular, it was shown that given a random population of molecules on
such a network, evolution tends to increase the neutrality in the population,
eﬀectively pushing the population into the center of the neutral network.
Because of the correlation between neutrality and epistasis discussed above,
we expect that this dynamic leads to a reduction of antagonistic epistatic
eﬀects as well. Thus, the selection for neutrality observed in Ref. [16] is
at the same time a selection against antagonistic epistatic eﬀects. To verify
this hypothesis, we carried out evolutionary experiments with the same RNA
sequences from Ref. [16] described above.

We performed one ﬂow-reactor run for each of the two networks found
in Ref. [16], starting with an initial population of 1,000 sequences chosen at
random from the respective network. The epistasis parameter β was deter-
mined for every sequence in the population every two hundred generations,
while the population neutrality was monitored constantly. The population
neutrality ¯ν is the average neutrality of all sequences currently in the popu-

7

lation. In Fig. 5, we present the results from the run on the larger of the two
networks. The neutrality of the initial population coincides with the network
neutrality (the average neutrality of all sequences on the network), which is
to be expected for a random initial population. Over the course of evolution,
the average population neutrality rose to the predicted equilibrium value. As
expected, the average epistasis parameter ¯β increased signiﬁcantly as well.
Results on the second network were qualitatively identical, with β increasing
from 0.78 to around 0.86. Thus, antagonistic epistasis is selected against
during adaptation for reduced mutational load on a neutral network.

Conclusions

Epistasis plays an important role in evolutionary theory, but remains em-
pirically largely unexplored. Using secondary structure prediction of RNA
sequences as well as digital organisms evolving in silico, we have demon-
strated a correlation between two important parameters of realistic genetic
ﬁtness landscapes: the average deleterious eﬀect of single mutations and the
strength of epistasis. This correlation, coupled with the selective pressure
which forces random sequences in a neutral network to cluster in the dense
areas of the network, leads to a selective pressure against strong antagonistic
epistasis. As the result of this pressure, a member of an evolved popula-
tion will have, on average, a higher β than a random sample of the ﬁtness
landscape would indicate.

It is well-known that antagonistic epistasis favors the accumulation of
deleterious mutations as well as the operation of Muller’s ratchet. Since in
such a situation sexual recombination (within a ﬁxed environment) tends
to worsen the loss of information, it is unlikely to evolve. The mechanism
described here provides a path towards an environment more conducive to
the evolution of recombination.

Methods

RNA secondary structures were obtained with the Vienna RNA package,
version 1.3.1 [15]. Default parameters were used, except that the free energies
of dangling ends were set to zero for the sequences of length ℓ = 18. The
parameters α and β were determined in the following manner. We calculated
α exactly from the fraction of neutral one-mutants. In addition, we sampled
the function w(n) for Hamming distances up to n = 8, by calculating the
structure of up to 106 random neighbors of the required Hamming distance.
The quantity β was then determined from a nonlinear ﬁt of −αnβ to the

8

logarithm of w(n).

In order to estimate the total number of sequences folding into the struc-
ture depicted in Fig. 3, we generated 108 random sequences of length ℓ = 18,
of which 10,961 sequences folded correctly. From this, we estimated Nν =
7.5 × 106 neutral sequences out of the 6.9 × 1010 sequences of length ℓ = 18.
In the ﬂow reactor simulations, we set the replication rates such that
sequences folding into the target structure replicated on average once per unit
time, while the replication rate of all other sequences was set to 10−6 per unit
time. All sequences had a probability of µ = 0.5 to suﬀer one random point
mutation per replication event. The possibility of several point mutations
per replication event was eliminated, to guarantee that the population could
not leave the speciﬁed neutral network [16]. The network neutrality, i.e., the
expected neutrality of a random sequence on the network, is ¯ν ≈ 12.0 for the
larger of the two, while the neutrality predicted for an evolved population
on that network is ρ ≈ 15.7. The value of ρ is found by calculating the
spectral radius of the neutral network’s connectivity matrix [16]. For the
smaller network, ¯ν ≈ 10.6 and ρ ≈ 13.5.

Abstract

We study the equilibrium behaviour of a deterministic four-state mutation–selection model
as a model for the evolution of a population of nucleotide sequences. The mutation model
is the Kimura 3ST mutation scheme, and selection is assumed to be permutation invariant.
Considering the evolution process both forward and backward in time, we use the ancestral
distribution as the stationary state of the backward process to derive an expression for the
mutational loss (as the diﬀerence between ancestral and population mean ﬁtness), and we
prove a maximum principle that determines the population mean ﬁtness in mutation–selection
balance.

Introduction

In population genetics, the investigation of mutation-selection models has attracted considerable
interest. In this framework, one is usually interested in equilibrium quantities such as means and
variances of the traits.

There have been various approaches to model DNA evolution that take into account the struc-
ture of the DNA, being a sequence of basic units, the four nucleotides. The ﬁrst approximation
is to diﬀerentiate only between wildtype and mutant. This leads to the so-called biallelic chain,
which was used as a model for biological evolution by Leuth¨ausser (1986, 1987) in a time-discrete
form and by Baake et al. (1997) in time-continuous form. Hermisson et al. (2001) reﬁned this to
a four-state model, taking into account all four nucleotides as units of the DNA structure. This is
the model we will investigate further in this article.

We do not use the conventional approach (if such a thing exists; for an overview of meth-
ods, see B¨urger (2000)), but follow a recently suggested method, see Hermisson et al. (2002),
which is based on considering the backward process and the ancestral distribution. The results
of Hermisson et al. (2002) are valid for a rather general class of mutation-selection models, but
one important restriction is that the ﬁtness function depends on one genetic variable only. In the
context of sequence evolution, this variable is the genetic distance to the wildtype, i.e., the num-
ber of sites where a sequence diﬀers from a given master sequence or wildtype. In this paper, we
generalise this approach to the four-state model for DNA evolution, where we have three diﬀerent
types of mutation, and we thus have to consider three genetic distances.

This setup limits us to the treatment of permutation-invariant ﬁtness functions, where the
ﬁtness only depends on the type and the number of mutations, not on their position in the
sequence. Although this is a strong constraint, the accumulation of small mutational eﬀects is
well described by this type of ﬁtness function. Furthermore, as realistic ﬁtness functions are very
diﬃcult to access, this is a widely used approximation, see e.g. B¨urger (2000) or Charlesworth
(1990). It results in an enormous simpliﬁcation of the model which, in many cases, allows explicit
solutions.

1

The four-state model (Hermisson et al., 2001) is a generalisation of the biallelic chain (Baake et al.,

1997). Mutation-selection models of this type are closely connected to certain models of statistical
physics, so-called quantum spin chains. Whereas the biallelic chain is related to the quantum
Ising chain, the four-state model considered in this article corresponds to the Ashkin-Teller quan-
tum chain, see e.g. Baxter (1982) and (Kohmoto et al., 1981). However, this correspondence does
not mean that results from statistical physics can be transferred directly to biology, because the
quantities considered in the context of statistical physics are not those that are of interest here,
compare the discussion by Baake and Wagner (2001).

The outline of this paper is as follows. We start with a general introduction to mutation–
selection models, deﬁning the ancestral distribution and the observables in this class of models.
This is then specialised to the sequences space of the four-state model which we are interested in.
Exploiting the permutation invariance of the ﬁtness function, the sequence space can be reduced
to the permutation-invariant sector. Subsequently, we deﬁne the mutational loss function and
state the maximum principle. This principle holds exactly in three special cases which we discuss
in detail. Finally, this is followed by a summary and brief outlook. The appendix is concerned
with the rather technical details of the proofs of the maximum principle.

2 Mutation-selection models

We consider a population of haploid individuals (or diploids without dominance) whose genotypes
are chosen from a sequence space, a set of a ﬁnite number ν of possible genotypes i. The population
is described by the population distribution p, with entries pi ≥
0, indicating the relative frequency
ν
of type i in the population. Hence, p has to be normalised such that
i=1 pi = 1. For ﬁnite
population size, the pi are rational numbers. In this article, we concentrate on the deterministic
limit of an inﬁnite population size; in this case, the relative frequencies can take real values.

P

Ignoring environmental eﬀects, mutation and selection are assumed to depend only on the
genotypes of individuals. In this framework, the evolutionary processes to be considered are birth
and death of individuals, and mutation from one type to another.

In the time-continuous model, each individual of type i gives birth to an identical copy with
di, also
a rate bi and dies with a rate di, hence we have an eﬀective reproduction rate ri = bi −
called the Malthusian ﬁtness (Fisher, 1930). These values are collected in a diagonal reproduction
matrix R.

Mutation from type j to i occurs with a rate Mij. To preserve the normalisation of the
population distribution p, the diagonal entries Mii of the mutation matrix M = (Mij) are chosen
i Mij = 0, which makes M a Markov
such that M has a vanishing sum over the columns,
generator. Unless we talk about unidirectional mutation (cf. Sec. 5.1), we will assume that the
mutation matrix is irreducible, i.e., each genotype can be reached from any other by mutation,
possibly in several steps. With the deﬁnition of the time-evolution operator H = R + M , this
leads to the evolution equation

where ¯r is the population mean ﬁtness ¯r(t) =

Irreducibility of M implies that of H, and the Perron-Frobenius (PF) theorem guarantees that
there exists a unique stable equilibrium solution, which is given by the strictly positive eigenvector
p corresponding to the largest eigenvalue λmax of H,

, the population distribution converges towards this equilibrium solution,

H p = λmax p .

2.1 The ancestor distribution

We are particularly interested in the equilibrium solutions ˙p = 0. In this case, Eq. (1) becomes an
eigenvalue equation for H with eigenvalue λmax = ¯r. The right PF eigenvector p is the population
distribution in equilibrium, whereas the entries zi of the left PF eigenvector z determine the relative
reproductive success of type-i individuals, as shown by Hermisson et al. (2002). The ancestral
distribution, also introduced by Hermisson et al. (2002), is a probability distribution deﬁned as
ai = zipi, with the normalisation of z chosen such that
i ai = 1. The ai specify the fraction of
the equilibrium population, whose ancestor an inﬁnitely long time ago is of type i.

In analogy to the way that the population distribution is deﬁned as a time-dependent quantity,
this can also be done for the relative reproductive success z and the ancestral distribution a.
However, this demands some notational eﬀorts, and as we do not need this property later on, we
limit ourselves to the deﬁnition of the ancestral distribution as an equilibrium quantity.

P

2.2 Means

A population is macroscopically described by mean quantities. We introduced two probability
distributions, hence there are two types of averages that are relevant in our model. Every mapping
o that assigns a value oi to each possible genotype i can be averaged with respect to the population
distribution or the ancestral distribution.

The population mean of o, denoted by ¯o(t), is given by

The population mean in equilibrium, i.e., in the limit as t

, is denoted by ¯o.

The ancestral mean of an operator o, denoted by ˆo, is deﬁned as

Note that the ancestral mean does not depend on time, as we deﬁned the ancestral distribution

3 The four-state model

The genetic information is coded in the DNA as a string composed of the purines adenine and
guanine (A,G) and the pyrimidines cytosine and thymine (C,T ).

{
++, +

A, G, C, T

We consider DNA strands of ﬁxed length N , which may, for instance, code an enzyme, as mod-
elled by Hermisson et al. (2001). The four basic states
are mapped onto
,
}
or, as it is done by Hermisson et al. (2001), onto
. Conveniently, one can ex-
ploit the freedom in the choice of this mapping by introducing a relative rather than an absolute
mapping between the bases
. This essentially means that
and the symbols
one can choose independent mappings at each position along the DNA strand. At any position, the
mapping can be deﬁned such that the symbol 0, or ++, corresponds to the corresponding base in
a given preferred sequence, which is usually chosen to be the wildtype or master sequence of max-
N = 000 . . . 0, see
imal ﬁtness rmax. Thus the wildtype sequence is mapped onto the sequence
Hermisson et al. (2001) for details. The sequence space consists of all possible N -letter sequences
in these four symbols, so it is given by

N and has dimension 4N .

bases along the DNA strand that diﬀer from those in the wildtype, we now need three non-negative

3.1 Mutation

Mutation is taken to be a point process that acts at each site independently. Disregarding more
complicated mechanisms such as deletions and insertions, we only take into account the replace-
ment of one base by another, which happens with certain rates µk, taken over the whole sequence.
We allow only one mutation to happen at a time, which leads to a single step mutation model,
as ﬁrst introduced by Ohta and Kimura (1973). We work with the Kimura 3ST mutation scheme
shown in Fig. 1 (Kimura, 1981; Swoﬀord et al., 1996) which assumes that, of a possible 12 mu-
tation rates that can be chosen in our setting, only three diﬀerent mutation rates µ1, µ2 and
µ3 occur. In particular, forward and backward mutation rates are the same, and the mutation
respects a symmetry between exchanges of purines and pyrimidines, see Fig. 1.

This mutation scheme can be treated to various degrees of sophistication. Apart from the full
Kimura 3ST scheme, where all three mutation rates are diﬀerent, there are also 2 simpler models
that are worth mentioning.

The simplest approach is to take all mutation rates to be equal, µ1 = µ2 = µ3. This case is

known as the Jukes-Cantor mutation scheme (Jukes and Cantor, 1969).

Due to the similar shapes of the nucleotides, transitions, i.e., the replacement of one purin/
pyrimidin by the other, are more frequent than transversions, i.e., the replacement of a purin/
pyrimidin by a pyrimidin/purin. The mutation rates describing the transversions are fairly similar,
µ3, whereas the mutation rate for the transitions µ2 is a factor of about 2 to 40 larger.
so µ1 ≈
This is taken into account in the Kimura 2 parameter model (Kimura, 1980) by assuming that
µ1 = µ3 < µ2.

Assume there is one particular sequence s0 with maximal ﬁtness rmax, the wildtype or master
N . For any other sequence, the corresponding representation

in terms of the symbols
is then obtained by comparing it to the wildtype, and assigning
0, 1, 2, 3
one of the labels 1, 2, 3 at each position where it diﬀers from the wildtype sequence, according to

the type of mutation as given in Fig. 1. Analogously to the mutational distance, we can deﬁne
the Hamming distance (Hamming, 1950) between two sequences si and sj, by comparing the
sequences with each other. The restricted Hamming distances dk(si, sj) are the numbers of type-k
mutations, i.e., mutations that occur with rate µk, between the sequences si and sj; the total
Hamming distance is d(si, sj) = d1(si, sj) + d2(si, sj) + d3(si, sj).

where, as mentioned above, the diagonal entries are chosen such that M is a Markov generator.
Here, the mutation rates are scaled as mutation rates per site, with the mutation rate over the
whole DNA string being constant, see discussion in Baake and Wagner (2001).

3.2 Selection

Whereas the process of mutation is well understood and straight forward to model, the choice of
the ﬁtness landscape on the molecular level is far from being clear. Realistic ﬁtness landscapes
would be rather rugged and strongly dependent on the function of the DNA sequence, but they
are hard to access experimentally.

We shall use the severe simpliﬁcation of a permutation-invariant ﬁtness function, which is
nevertheless a rather common assumption in biological models. This means that the ﬁtness of a
sequence depends only on the number of mutations, not on their location within the sequence.
Hence, we can describe a sequence completely by its mutational distance d = (d1, d2, d3) with
respect to the wildtype sequence. As there are 4N diﬀerent sequences, but only (N +1)(N +2)(N +3)
diﬀerent distances d with 0
d1+d2+d3 ≤
N , this reduces the relevant sequence space enormously.
In the permutation-invariant ﬁtness model, the number of possible diﬀerent genotypes and thus
the dimension of the sequence space is ﬁxed to ν = (N +1)(N +2)(N +3)

The sequence space can be visualised in 3d Cartesian coordinates as a simplex in the positive

4 Reduction to the permutation-invariant sector

To exploit the reduction to a smaller sequence space, we transform our time-evolution operator
H, which is a 4N
that describes
the permutation-invariant sector only. This is done by the means of a transformation T . We have

A condition on the transformation T is that it preserves the Markov property of the mutation
matrix M . Hence, it must be an L1-transformation, which is guaranteed by the property
i Tij =
1. For the relevant permutation-invariant sector, we need to combine all sequences that belong
to the same mutational distance vector d, which essentially means to consider their sum. This,
together with the Markov condition, determines the entries in the ﬁrst ν columns of T . In the
column assigned to d, each entry is either 0, or, if the sequence corresponding to the row in
question has the mutational distance d, it is 1/nd, where nd is the number of sequences that are
mapped onto d. This number is given by the multinomial coeﬃcients

There is an alternative way to arrive at a matrix that describes the permutation-invariant

states in the permutation-invariant sector are again superpositions of all sequences of equal distance
d, but now with amplitudes 1/√nd, as opposed to 1/nd for the L1-transformation T . Knowing
this connection, we can symmetrise the permutation-invariant sector of the time-evolution operator

The property that H is symmetrisable by means of a diagonal transformation allows us to write
the eigenvalue equation (2) in ancestor formulation, which is the starting point for the proofs of
the maximum principle. In fact, the proofs presented below can be formulated for any mutation
matrix that is symmetrisable by a diagonal transformation, which is equivalent to the property
that it describes a reversible process,

q

Mij qj = Mji qi,

(13)

qj/qi =

Mij = Mij

where q is the equilibrium distribution of the mutation process without selection. In this case,
we can use the diagonal transformation Qij = δij√qj, and from (13), we obtain the symmetrised
mutation rates
MijMji. Therefore, the mutational distances are not bound
to be the numbers of mutations of a DNA sequence, but the model can be reinterpreted in the
multilocus model context, where the genetic distances are three arbitrary traits that determine
the ﬁtness. In fact, the maximum principle discussed below can also be derived for a model with n
states at each site of the sequence, which then has an interpretation as n traits contributing to the
ﬁtness, as long as we talk about a n-dimensional single step model with a mutation matrix that
describes a reversible process. A more general and more systematic approach thus seems feasible,
it will be described by Baake et al. (2003).

5 Maximum principle

For the permutation-invariant system, we can derive a maximum principle for the population mean
ﬁtness that involves maximisation only over the three components of x = d/N , as opposed to the
maximisation over the ν-dimensional sequence space according to Rayleigh’s principle. It ﬁnds its
analogue in the scalar maximum principle given in (Hermisson et al., 2002, Eqs. (30) and (33)).

with summation over all six directions of mutation ξ.

This is exact for three special cases, namely for (i) unidirectional mutation, for (ii) linear
ﬁtness and mutation functions, and, most importantly, (iii) in the limit of inﬁnite sequence length.
This will be explained in what follows, and the derivation of the maximum principle for each case
is presented as well. For other systems, the maximum principle gives an approximation, which,
under reasonable assumptions, one might expect to diﬀer from the true result by correction terms
of order 1/N .

If the supremum in Eq. (17) is assumed at a unique value x, which is the generic case, this

value is the ancestor mean mutational distance ˆx, and we have, in addition to Eq. (17),

¯r = r(ˆx)

g(ˆx) = ˆr

g(ˆx) ,

−

−

(19)

which again is exact for the three special cases mentioned before. This maximum principle, in the
terminology of physics, is akin to the principle of minimal free energy in physics.

5.1 Unidirectional mutation

We now consider the ﬁrst of the three situations where the maximum principle is exact, the case
of unidirectional mutation.

Unidirectional mutation means that only deleterious mutations happen, the mutation rates
towards ﬁtter or equally ﬁt types are zero. This does not go in line with the mutation rates for
the DNA system as given in Eq. (9), but it is equivalent with a collapse of the mutation scheme
as shown in Fig. 3.

For unidirectional mutation, the mutation matrix M is no longer irreducible. Hence, in this
case, the Perron-Frobenius theorem does not apply. The equilibrium is not unique, but depends
on initial conditions. Once the ﬁttest type is lost in the population, it can never occur again,
because the mutation rates back to ﬁtter types are zero. The structure of the sequence space is
shown in Fig. 4, where the wildtype on the top corner of the sequence space “feeds” all mutants
underneath.

Although unidirectional mutation rates do not represent the mutation model for DNA se-
quences as set up in this article, they still are a reasonable approximation. If in the DNA model

with a small mutational distance from the wildtype. The neutral (eξ = el −
(eξ =
ek) mutations occur with rates proportional to xk, and therefore are small for individu-
als with small mutational distances x, which form the main part of the population, whereas the
deleterious mutations (eξ = ek) happen with rates proportional to 1
x, which are of order 1
for small x. Therefore, it is reasonable to approximate the mutation rates of the DNA model by
unidirectional mutation rates.

In the case of unidirectional mutation, the sequence space can be divided into three domains
with respect to each sequence d, namely the ancestral cone, the oﬀspring cone and the sibling
domain. Here, all sequences that can mutate to d lie in the ancestral cone AC(d), all sequences
that d can mutate to lie in the oﬀspring cone OC(d), whereas the sequences that are not connected
to d via a mutational path form the sibling domain SD(d), which is the remainder of the sequence
space.

If, however, the wildtype is not present in the initial population p(t = 0) and the neutral and ad-
vantageous mutation rates are exactly zero, we have to consider only the part of the sequence space

If this maximum is unique, the equilibrium population is given by the right eigenvector corre-

An interesting case arises, however, if the maximum is not unique, but attained at two sequences

overlap and thus it is not possible to normalise z such that

We now have to distinguish between two cases. If the sequences lie in parent-oﬀspring relation,

5.2 Linear model

the three components of x, and the maximum principle in the form of Eqs. (17) and (19) holds
true for yk(xk) = xk. This can be shown by a direct calculation starting from Eq. (16), which is
carried out in Appendix A.1.

Finally, we consider the limit as the sequence length becomes inﬁnite. In the limit N

xd = d/N to describe the mutational distance to the wildtype. The quantities xdk = dk/N and

ﬁnite N , the xdk take discrete rational values only; in the limit N

dense, and it is thus reasonable to pass to a continuum formulation. Consider the ﬁtness function
r(x) and the mutation rates u±ξ(x) as functions deﬁned on the permutation-invariant sector of
the sequence space. The mutation rates are positive, continuous functions, obeying the boundary
condition that they vanish for all x at the boundary of the sequence space, where they correspond
to mutations out of the sequence space. The ﬁtness function has to be piecewise continuous,
i.e., it can have discontinuities only along (ﬁnitely many) surfaces in the sequence space; at the
discontinuities, it must be either left or right continuous. This allows for all biological meaningful
ﬁtness functions, like, for example, truncation selection. For any ﬁnite N , the ﬁtness and mutation

6 Summary

In this article, we investigated the mutation-selection balance in the mutation-selection model in-
troduced by Hermisson et al. (2001). There, a deterministic approach to model the DNA evolution
of asexual populations was taken. Therefore, we consider four-state sequences subject to the forces
of mutation and selection. For simplicity, selection is taken to be permutation invariant, which
leads to a three-dimensionally structured sequence space, and the mutation model is a single step
model on this structure.

Using the concept of the ancestral distribution, as introduced by Hermisson et al. (2002), we
derived a maximum principle for the population mean ﬁtness ¯r and the ancestral mean genotype
ˆx in equilibrium, which involves a maximisation over the three dimensions of the sequence space.
This maximum principle gives the exact mean ﬁtness in the three limiting cases of (i) unidirec-
tional mutation, (ii) linear ﬁtness and mutation functions, and (iii) in the limit of inﬁnite sequence
length. For ﬁnite sequence length, it is an approximation which we expect to be correct up to
terms of the order 1/N . Numerically, we found that already rather small sequence lengths were
well reproduced.

The maximum principle generalises the results of Hermisson et al. (2002), where the case of
a sequence space with one-dimensional structure was treated, which can be interpreted on the
level of DNA sequences as a two-state model, with states representing wildtype and mutant, as
In that case, ¯r, ˆx and ¯x = r−1(¯r) could be obtained by a
introduced by Baake et al. (1997).
maximisation over one dimension. In our model, we have to maximise over the three dimensions
of the sequence space to obtain ¯r and ˆx, whereas the population mean genotype ¯x cannot be
derived as easily, because the ﬁtness function is not uniquely invertible in three dimensions.

Other quantities of interest are the corresponding variances. The expressions for the variance
of the ﬁtness given by Hermisson et al. (2002) can only be generalised to our model in the linear
case, not for the case of inﬁnite sequence length. Neither can the variance of mutational distance
be obtained in a simply way, because this involves inversion of the ﬁtness function, which does not
have a unique solution in more than one dimension.

Although our setup is motivated by a model for DNA evolution, it is valid for a system where
the ﬁtness depends on three arbitrary traits d1, d2 and d3 with a single-step mutation model, as
long as the mutation matrix describes a reversible process, i.e., Mijqj = Mjiqi with q being the
equilibrium distribution of the mutation process without selection. In fact, the maximum principle
can be generalised to an n-state model, where we have n
1 diﬀerent traits determining the ﬁtness.
In this case, we have to maximise over these n

−
1 quantities.

Similarly, the restriction to permutation-invariant ﬁtness functions could be dropped. In this
case, however, we would have to maximise over the N sites of the sequence, so that it loses its
use, which lies primarily in the simplicity.

A.2 Proof for inﬁnite sequence length

.
→ ∞

The proof of the maximum principle in the case N
closely follows the corresponding proof
in the two-state model, compare Hermisson et al. (2002). The idea is to establish upper and lower
bounds for a system with ﬁnite N , which can be shown to converge towards each other in the
limit as N

→ ∞

In order to obtain a lower bound, we look at the system locally. To be speciﬁc, we consider a
volume Vs,d0 in the sequence space around d0, containing the sequences that can be reached from
sequence d0 in at most s mutational steps. If this volume intersects a region where r has a jump,
we take as Vs,d0 only that part containing d0 where r is continuous. The number of sequences
contained in Vs,d0 is denoted by n(Vs,d0 ).

The part of the time-evolution operator associated with this volume consists of those ma-
trix elements where both the row and the column index correspond to sequences in Vs,d0. This
n(Vs,d0)-dimensional submatrix describes a system with an eﬀective mutational outﬂow,
n(Vs,d0)
and hence the local growth rate is lower than the global growth rate. Thus, the largest eigenvalue
¯rs,d0 of this submatrix yields a lower bound for the largest eigenvalue ¯rN of the whole (but still
ﬁnite) system.

×

In order to obtain estimates for ¯rs,d0 , we use the symmetrised system described by

H. This

can be done because the eigenvalues of the corresponding submatrices are the same.

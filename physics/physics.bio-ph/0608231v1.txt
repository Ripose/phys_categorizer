We propose that single-stranded adenine bases form helical H aggregates, and assign long-lived
emissive states observed in 20-base DNA stacks to low-energy Frenkel excitons with diminishing
oscillator strength. Calculated excitonic coupling between adjacent transition dipoles is in good
agreement with the measured absorption spectrum of 20-base stacks that exhibits a blue shift of 2.6
nm relative to that of the monomeric species.

PACS numbers:

Here we propose that single-stranded DNA forms H ag-
gregates with a helical shoulder-to-shoulder conﬁguration
of transition dipoles. Dipolar interactions in such a con-
ﬁguration render adjacent transition dipoles to have al-
ternating directions in order to lower electronic energies.
Consequently, the oscillator strength is concentrated in
several high-energy states of the exciton band leaving
the low-energy states near the band bottom almost opti-
cally forbidden. We thus identify the long-lived emissive
states in 20-base DNA stacks as low-energy Frenkel exci-
ton states with diminishing oscillator strength. Evidence

Excited states of nucleic acid bases are highly stable
to photochemical decay of solar UV photons thanks to
the selection pressure from a long evolutionary process
that spans billions of years. This photostability reduces
the need for costly enzymatic repair [1] of photodam-
aged DNA, but is not well-understood. In fact, the do-
main of human knowledge on the basic human genome
has been only recently expanded to conﬁgurational prop-
erties of nucleic acids with the advent of a full iden-
tiﬁcation of the approximately 20,000 to 25,000 genes
in human DNA. Dynamics of photo-excited states and
UV photochemistry of nucleic acids, on the other hand,
remain largely uncharted. Ultraviolet photo-excitation
in single DNA bases is known to decay non-radiatively
on a subpicosecond timescale [2]. In base-staked DNA,
however, much less has been understood regarding mul-
tichromphoric DNA photophysics in general and excess
electronic energy elimination in particular. A long-lived
emissive state in stacked DNA bases that is absent in
base monomers has been observed by a number of au-
thors [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], among which early studies on
DNA base dimers were carried out three to four decades
ago [3, 4, 5]. Present in time-resolved studies of various
single and double DNA strands, the long-lived excited
states with lifetimes in the 100∼1000 ps regime may in-
crease their propensity towards photochemical reactions,
and therefore, there has been some expectation about
a direct link between these states and some important
photo-lesions in living cells, followed by intense experi-
mental and theoretical interest on the photophysical na-
ture of these states.

In double-stranded DNA, bases form base-pairs hor-
izontally and base-stacks vertically. It has been shown
that vertical stacking, and not base pairing, is responsible
for singlet excited-state properties in single- and double-
stranded oligo-nucletides composed of adenine (A) and
thymine (T) bases [7]. However, much is to be learned
about the physical nature of the singlet excited states
that are believed to reside within a single strand, and
are loosely termed as the ”excimer” states in the existing
literature. Formally speaking, an excimer is an excited
dimer made of two identical components, and it is there-
fore somewhat misleading to use the term on the long-
lived emissive state as the singlet excitation can easily
spread over more than two bases in multimers [9, 10].

from an absorption-spectral comparison between single-
base adenosine and 20-base adenine strands lends strong
support to our proposed picture.

Electronic structures of a B-form DNA strand of 20
adenine bases have been investigated by means of ZINDO
calculations. ZINDO (Zerner’s INDO) is a semiempirical
quantum mechanical program developed by M.C. Zerner
that oﬀers a number of electronic structure methods with
varying sophistication [11, 12, 13]. Results from the
ZINDO calculations for the 20-base strand of adenine are
listed in Table 1 showing 20 lowest-energy excited states
and their corresponding oscillator strength. The oscil-
lator strength is found to be concentrated on the 16th
and 17th excited states counting from the lowest-energy
state due to the symmetry of the stacking. From Table
1, the bandwidth is estimated to be 0.212 eV implying
that the near-neighbor coupling J is about 0.053 eV. This
value of J has been corroborated by ZINDO calculations
of dimers, trimers, quardrupmers, and pentamers of the
adenine bases. The ZINDO results are in excellent agree-
ment with a simple Frenkel exciton model that incorpo-
rates an angle of π/5 between adjacent transition dipoles
of the DNA bases:

ˆH = X

(1)

Here Jnm is the interation between transition dipoles
on bases n and m with the coupling between nearest
neighbors J=Jn,n+1, and B†
n (Bn) creates (annihilates) a
Frenkel exciton on base n. Without loss of generality, the
periodic boundary condition is employed ﬁrst, and the os-
cillator strength is found to be shared entirely by the two
degenerate states near the top of the exciton band with
crystal momenta K=±π/10a (a is the base spacing 3.4˚A).

These two optically allowed states are exactly the 16th
and 17th states counting from the lowest-energy state at
the bottom of the band, K=π/a, which is optically for-
bidden. After relaxing the periodic boundary condition,
small leakage of the oscillator strength appears on other
states, analogous to Table 1. Aside from ﬁnite-size ef-
fects (open boundaries), static disorder in the strand can
also spread oscillator strength to otherwise forbidden ex-
citon states. Similar Frenkel exciton models have been
applied with great success to model excited-state dynam-
ics in purple-bacteria light-harvesting antenna complexes
where arrays of bacterio-chlorophyll chromophores en-
able energy transfer in photosynthesis [14, 15, 16, 17]. In
fact, applications of the excitonic model to DNA strands,
as suggested by Kohler and co-workers in their recent re-
view article [21], were also contemplated by Markovitsi et
al. in their account of observed decay of ﬂuorescence and
ﬂuorescence anisotropy despite attributing the long-lived
emission to charge-transfer states [20].

In contrast to H-aggregates, neighboring transition
dipoles in J-aggregates are arranged in a head-to-tail con-
ﬁguration, and therefore, in low-lying excitonic states the
transition dipoles are parallel to each other. J-aggregates
were known from the mid thirties to be highly ﬂuorescent
with absorption maxima red-shifted relative to those of
their monomeric pigments [18, 19]. On the other hand,
H-aggregates exhibit weak or no ﬂuorescence in addition
to blue-shifted absorption spectra. The origin of the
blue shift can be understood from the aforementioned
oscillator-strength concentration near the top of the H-
aggregate exciton band. Although absorption peaks of a
DNA-base ensemble depend on a number of factors such
as solvent eﬀects, ensemble disorder and exciton-phonon
interactions, the amount of the blue shift should be of the
same order of magnitude as the coupling between adja-
cent transition dipoles. Measured absorption spectra of
single-base adenosine and adenine strands containing 20
bases in aqueous solution, as shown in Figure 2, give
strong support to the proposed H-aggregation picture of
DNA-base strands. The commercially available samples
were excited by a laser pulse in the UV at 267 nm. The
absorption peak of the 20-base strands (∼ 257.2 nm) are
blue-shifted by about 2.6 nm (400 cm−1 or 0.05 eV) from
that of the corresponding monomeric species (∼ 259.8
nm), in good agreement with our calculated value of exci-
tonic coupling strength between neighboring DNA bases,
J=0.052 eV. Measured absorption spectra have been ﬁt-
ted with the Brownian oscillator (BO) model in which
a two-level electronic degree of freedom responsible for
absorption is coupled to a phonon mode that is itself at-
tached to a dissipative bath of harmonic oscillators. A
best ﬁt is found with a phonon frequency 1120 cm−1 and
a system-bath coupling strength 300 cm−1 [22, 23, 24].
The BO ﬁt for the single-base adenosine (red line) pro-
duces a Huang-Rhys factor S = 3, and that for the 20-
base strands (blue line), S = 4.3. Experimentally, the
monomer Stokes shift is found to be about 6000 cm−1 [8]
in excellent agreement with our ﬁtting-deduced Huang-

Absorption spectrum

FIG. 2: Measured absorption spectra of single-base adeno-
sine (Ado, red circle) and adenine strands that contain 20
bases (A20, blue square) in aqueous solution. The samples
were excited by a laster pulse in the UV at 267 nm. The ab-
sorption maximum of the 20-base strands (∼ 257.2 nm) are
blue-shifted by about 2.6 nm relative to that of the single-
base adenosine (∼ 259.8 nm). Measured absorption spectra
have been ﬁtted with the BO model with an electronic degree
−1
of freedom coupled to a primary phonon mode of 1120 cm
which in turn interacts linearly with a dissipative bath via a
coupling strength 300 cm−1. The BO ﬁt for the single-base
adenosine (red line) produces a Huang-Rhys factor S = 3,
and that for the 20-base strands (blue line), S = 4.3.

Rhys factor S = 3. For 20-bases adenine strands, the
measured Stokes shift slightly exceeds that from the ﬁt-
ting.

J-aggregates usually have a strong ﬂuorescence emis-
sion with a small Stokes shift. In contrast, ﬂuorescence
spectra for the 20-base adenine strands show a broad
structure with a half-width about 10,000 cm−1 and a
peak at 360-400 nm, while ﬂuorescence spectra for single-
base adenosine peak at 307 nm. The fact that the ﬂu-
orescence spectra are red-shifted relative to those of the
monomeric species sits well with our H-aggregate model
because internal conversion to the lowest excitonic state
in H aggregates happens much faster than emission, and
ﬂuorescence originates from the lowest-energy exciton
state (and perhaps even from defect states below the bot-
tom of the exciton band, and thus the large half-width).
Due to the small oscillator strength of the low-lying exci-
tonic states which is generated by disorder and strand
boundaries, radiative lifetimes of the 20-base adenine

3

strands are greatly increased relative to their monomer
species. This is in agreement with radiative rates esti-
mated from measured absorption spectra of monomers
and 20-base strands using the Strickler-Berg equation
[25]. The radiative rate constant for monomeric emis-
sion is found to be much larger than that for 20-base
strands [8]. Our assignment here is also supported by an
observed systematic decrease in the excited-state popu-
lation of the long-lived emission in a poly(A) solution as
the temperature increases from 25 to 70 Celsius [26]. An
increase in temperature will shift the excited state popu-
lation to higher-energy states in the exciton band at the
expense of the lowest-energy state at the band bottom
which gives rise to longer radiative lifetimes.

Despite much theoretical and experimental attention
devoted to DNA photochemistry, a clear description of
the long-lived emissive state in DNA strands had re-
mained elusive, and much contention still surrounds its
physical nature and decay mechanisms. Here we have
for single-stranded
proposed an H-aggregation model
adenine DNA so to give a simple, consistent explanation
of various spectral observations. The long-lived emissive
states observed in 20-base DNA stacks has been identi-
ﬁed as the lowest exciton state with diminishing oscillator
strength. Calculated excitonic coupling between adjacent
transition dipoles are in good agreement with measured
absorption spectra of stacked and unstaked bases.
In
the literature, DNA strands have been used as templates
for building H-aggregates of a cyanine dye [27, 28]. It is
somewhat surprising that optical spectra of DNA strands
had never been discussed in the context of H-aggregation.
Furthermore, the lack of H-aggregation discussions also
contributed to the frequent assignment [7, 20] of charge-
transfer states to the long-lived emission in DNA strands
despite the apparent contradiction that charge-transfer
states are usually much higher in the energy ladder than
the simple Frenkel excitons, and therefore, it is diﬃcult
for internal conversion to bring about the long-emitting
charge-transfer states [20]. By assigning the long-lived
emission to the lowest exciton state, we provide a new,
self-consistent perspective to the excited-state dynamics
in DNA strands by circumventing the contradictory in-
troduction of charge-transfer states into ﬂuorescence as-
sigements. Our work here therefore opens up new venues
to study photochemical decay of excited states in nuclei
acid bases.

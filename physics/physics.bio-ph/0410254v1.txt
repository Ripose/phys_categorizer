Channel proteins, that selectively conduct molecules across cell membranes, often exhibit an
asymmetric structure. By means of a stochastic model, we argue that channel asymmetry in the
presence of non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations, fueled by the cell’s metabolism as observed recently, can
dramatically inﬂuence the transport through such channels by a ratchet-like mechanism. For an
aquaglyceroporin that conducts water and glycerol we show that a previously determined asymmetric
glycerol potential leads to enhanced inward transport of glycerol, but for unfavorably high glycerol
concentrations also to enhanced outward transport that protects a cell against poisoning.

Living cells interact with their extracellular environ-
ment through the cell membrane, which acts as a pro-
tective permeability barrier for preserving the internal
integrity of the cell. However, cell metabolism requires
controlled molecular transport across the cell membrane,
a function that is fulﬁlled by a wide variety of transmem-
brane proteins, acting as passive and active transporters
[1]. Channel proteins as passive transporters facilitate
the diﬀusion of speciﬁc molecules across the membrane
down a free energy gradient. Active transporters con-
duct molecules along or against the free energy gradient
consuming for that purpose external energy. However,
the plasma membrane of living cells is subject to a vari-
ety of non-equilibrium, i.e., non-thermal processes, e.g.,
interaction with the cytoskeleton and with active mem-
brane proteins [2, 3].
In this Letter we want to argue
that in an active plasma membrane even passive chan-
nel proteins can act as active transporters by consuming
energy from non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations fueled by cell
metabolism [4].

The Escherichia coli glycerol uptake facilitator (GlpF)
is an aquaglycerol channel protein, which transports both
water and glycerol molecules, but excluding charged so-
lutes, e.g., protons [5]. The recently determined 3D struc-
ture of GlpF at atomic resolution [6] (Fig. 1) has pro-
vided much insight into the underlying microscopic mech-
anism of molecular transport and selectivity through
GlpF [7]. In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) stud-
ies [8, 9, 10, 11] established that water and glycerol dif-
fusion through GlpF is single ﬁle, and for biologically
relevant periplasmic glycerol concentrations correlation
eﬀects between consecutive glycerol molecules are neg-
ligible due to their large spatial separation. The corre-
sponding potential of mean force (PMF) [8] that guides
the transport of glycerol through the channel is highly
asymmetric reﬂecting the atomic structure of GlpF (see
Fig. 1), with a prominent potential well at the exter-
nal (periplasmic) side and a constriction region with sev-

eral pronounced potential barriers towards the internal
(cytoplasmic) side of the channel [6, 12]. Besides GlpF,

there are several other porins which exhibit similar spa-
tial asymmetry [13, 14, 15], and in spite of recent eﬀorts,
no biological function could be attributed to the asym-
metry [16]. Here we propose and demonstrate that under
realistic physiological conditions, the asymmetry of GlpF
furnishes active glycerol transport through a ratchet-like
mechanism. In general, the ratchet eﬀect refers to the
generation of directed motion of Brownian particles in
a spatially periodic and asymmetric (ratchet) potential
in the presence of non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations and/or
externally applied time-periodic force with zero mean
[17, 18, 19]. Since cell membranes are subject to non-
equilibrium ﬂuctuations, which span a wide range of time
and length scales [2, 4], one expects a ratchet eﬀect con-
tribution to the transport through asymmetric channel
proteins, such as GlpF, even if the PMF is non-periodic.

Assuming simpliﬁed, heuristic models, the ratchet eﬀect
has been invoked before to explain the functioning of ac-
tive biomolecules, e.g., motor proteins and ATP hydrol-
ysis driven ion pumps [17, 20]. To our knowledge this
Letter uses for the ﬁrst time a realistic, microscopically
determined PMF to investigate the precise role of non-
equilibrium ﬂuctuations in facilitated transport. We ﬁnd
that as a result of channel asymmetry glycerol uptake,
driven by a concentration gradient, is enhanced signif-
icantly in the presence of non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations.
Furthermore, the ratchet eﬀect-caused enhancement is
larger for the outward, i.e., from the cytoplasm to the
periplasm, ﬂux than for the inward one, suggesting that
non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations also play an important role
in protecting the interior of the cell against excess uptake
of glycerol.

Glycerol transport through GlpF can be modeled in
terms of overdamped Brownian motion along the axis
of the channel as a result of the concentration gradi-
ent established at the ends of the channel. The inter-
action of a diﬀusing glycerol molecule with the protein,
solvent, lipid and other glycerol molecules is taken into
account through the PMF, U (x), as determined from
steered molecular dynamics simulations by employing the
Jarzynski equality [8]. The motion of a glycerol molecule
inside GlpF and in the presence of an external force F (t)
in the strong friction limit is described by the Langevin
equation (LE): γ ˙x = f (x) + ξ(t) + F (t), where γ is the
friction coeﬃcient, f (x) = −U ′(x) is the deterministic
force derived from the PMF, and ξ(t) is the Langevin
force due to the equilibrium thermal ﬂuctuations. As
usual, ξ(t) is a Gaussian white noise with hξ(t)i = 0 and
hξ(t)ξ(0)i = 2Dγ2δ(t), where δ(t) is the Dirac-delta func-
tion, and D is the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient of a glyc-
erol molecule inside GlpF. According to the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem, D and γ are related through the
Einstein relation D = kBT /γ. We assume that F (t)
is time-dependent, but homogeneous.
It describes ei-
ther an externally applied force, or some intrinsic non-
equilibrium ﬂuctuations of the system (see below). Due
to the single ﬁle nature of the glycerol transport through
GlpF, a force applied at either end of the channel will
be transmitted along the ﬁle without signiﬁcant loss in
intensity (incompressibility of the single ﬁle), which justi-
ﬁes our assumption that F (t) is homogeneous along the
channel. For a periodic f (x), the above LE describes
what is often referred to as a ﬂuctuating force (tilting)
ratchet [17].

At this point we introduce dimensionless units that
will be employed throughout this paper, unless otherwise
stated. All other units can be expressed in terms of the
following three: length of GlpF L = L ≈ 4.8 nm, diﬀu-
sion time T = τD = L2/D ≈ 10−7s, and thermal energy
E = kBT ≈ 4.28 × 10−21 J; here kB is the Boltzmann
constant, T = 310 K is the physiological temperature,
and D ≈ 2.2 × 10−10 m2/s is the eﬀective diﬀusion coef-

ﬁcient of glycerol inside GlpF [16]. Thus, the force unit
is F = γD/L = kBT /L ≈ 0.9 pN .
In the new units,
the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) corresponding to the
above LE reads

∂tp(x, t) = −∂xJ(x, t),

(1a)
J(x, t) = −∂xp(x, t) + [f (x) + F (t)]p(x, t) (1b)

where p(x, t)dx is the (unnormalized) probability of ﬁnd-
ing a glycerol molecule in (x, x + dx) (see Fig 1), and
J(x, t) is the local, instantaneous ﬂux of glycerol through
the channel. The probability density p(x) is related to
the local concentration C(x) by p(x) = S(x)C(x), with
S(x) the area of the channel cross section. From the crys-
tal structure one ﬁnds that the opening area at both ends
of GlpF is S0 ≡ S(0) ≈ S(1) ≈ 100 ˚A2 [6].

duced by a square-wave force in GlpF. Shown are the inward
[p1 = 0], outward [p0 = 0], and equal concentration [p1 = p0]

GlpF can be regarded as a nanopore, which connects
two reservoirs of glycerol molecules located at x = 0
(periplasm) and x = 1 (cytoplasm), respectively (Fig 1).
The glycerol uptake is driven by a concentration gradi-
ent: glycerol concentration (and therefore p0 ≡ p(0)) is
ﬁnite in the periplasm and vanishingly small in the cy-
toplasm (p1 ≡ p(1) ≈ 0). Indeed, once glycerol enters
the cytoplasm it gets phosphorylated by glycerol kinase
(GK) and, as a charged particle, the product glycerol
phosphate cannot leave the cell [21]. However, exces-
sive accumulation of glycerol phosphate may result in
cell poisoning and death. To avoid this, the enzyme GK
is genetically turned oﬀ, preventing further glycerol phos-
phorylation [21]. Since the glycerol concentration gradi-
ent across the cell membrane persists, one expects that
glycerol uptake should continue, in spite of its poten-
tial damaging eﬀect on the cell, until this gradient van-
ishes (i.e., p1 = p0). Below we demonstrate that channel
asymmetry, combined with non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations,

can stop glycerol uptake against the persistent concentra-
tion gradient, keeping the cytoplasmic glycerol at a level
p1 < p0. To this end, we calculate the steady glycerol

ﬂux through GlpF in four distinct cases corresponding
to suitable choices of F (t).

1) Transport driven by concentration gradient [F (t) =
0] – In the steady state, the ﬂux is constant throughout
the channel [c.f. Eq 1a] and, in the absence of the external
force F (t), is given by

J(p0, p1) = A0p0 − A1p1,

i = 0, 1 (2b)

Since the PMF U (x) vanishes on both sides of the chan-
nel, i.e., U0 ≡ U (0) = U (1) ≡ U1 = 0 (see Fig. 1), one
has A0 = A1, and the ﬂux is proportional to the glycerol
concentration diﬀerence, i.e., J(p0, p1) = A0 (p0 − p1) =
A0S0 (C0 − C1). Hence, the ﬂux vanishes in the absence
of a concentration gradient, and the ﬂux is insensitive
to the asymmetry of the channel. In order to produce
directed transport, one needs to drive the system out
of equilibrium, e.g., by applying an external force or by
subjecting the system to non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations.

2) Transport driven by potential gradient [F (t) = F0 =
const.] – The dependence of the ﬂux on the asymmetry
of the channel is manifest when U0 6= U1, i.e., in the
presence of a potential gradient. The constant external
force leads to an eﬀective, tilted PMF, Uef f (x) = U (x) −
F0x, and according to Eqs. 2 the stationary ﬂux reads

J (F0|p0, p1) = A0(F0) p0 − A1(F0) p1

A0(F0) =

, A1(F0) = A0(F0)e−F0

(3b)
For a symmetric PMF, i.e., U (1 − x) = U (x), follows
A1(−F0) = A0(F0), implying that the (magnitude of the)
ﬂux is also symmetric |J (F0|p0, p1) | = |J (−F0|p1, p0) |.
In general, for a generic asymmetric PMF the inward and
outward ﬂuxes will be diﬀerent. Under normal conditions
when p1 = 0, the inward ﬂux is J > = A0(F0)p0. The
same ﬂux through an inverted channel, i.e., (p0, p1) →
(0, p0) and F0 → −F0 , would be J < = A1(−F0)p0. It
can be readily checked that J ≷/J0 > 1, i.e., the con-
stant driving force enhances the ﬂux when applied along
the concentration gradient. Furthermore, according to
Fig. 2a, under identical conditions the ﬂux through the
inverted channel is always larger than the ﬂux through
the normally oriented GlpF, the ratio of the two increas-
ing monotonically with F0.

3) Transport driven by an external periodic driv-
ing force – Next, we consider an external force F (t)
that switches periodically between ±F0, F0 = const
(square-wave force). Although the time average of
F (t) is zero, this force induces a ﬁnite ﬂux through
GlpF even in the absence of a concentration gradi-
ent.
Indeed, assuming that one can neglect the tran-
sient in the instantaneous ﬂux after switching F (t), the
mean ﬂux ¯J through the channel can be expressed as

¯J(F0|p0, p1) = [J(F0|p0, p1) + J(−F0|p0, p1)] /2, where
J(F0|p0, p1) is given by Eq. 3a. Then, for p1 = p0,
¯J/J0 ≡ ¯J(F0|p0, p0)/ ¯J(0|p0, 0) is negative, and decreases
monotonically with F0, as shown in Fig. 2c.
In this
case too, ¯J < 0 implies that for GlpF the outward
ﬂux J < = −J(−F0|0, p0) is bigger than the inward ﬂux
J > = J(F0|p0, 0) as shown in Fig. 2b, and both ﬂuxes
J ≷ are bigger than J0, the ﬂux in the absence of the ex-
ternal force. Furthermore, the concentration ratio p1/p0
at which the ﬂux through the channel vanishes (current
reversal), i.e., ¯J(F0|p0, p1) = 0, is plotted as a function of
F0 in Fig. 2d. The values p1/p0 < 1 found are expected
and consistent with the fact that for the same force level
and concentration gradient, the outward ﬂux is larger
than the inward ﬂux.

4) Transport driven by non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations –
Finally, we consider the eﬀect of non-equilibrium ﬂuc-
tuations of the cell membrane on the glycerol trans-
port through GlpF. We model such ﬂuctuations by a
random telegraph force (RTF), i.e., a homogeneous di-
chotomous force F (t), which switches between two states
±F0 with switching times that obey a Poisson distribu-
tion. For the RTF holds hF (t)i = 0, and hF (t)F (0)i =
0 e−2t/T0 , where T0 is the mean switching time. The
F 2
stationary FPE in this case consists of two coupled equa-
tions, −∂2
xp±(x) + ∂x[f (x)p±(x)] ± F0p±(x) − p±(x)/T0 +
p∓(x)/T0 = 0, where p±(x) is the conditional probabil-
ity density that the RTF is in the ±F0 state. The cor-
responding ﬂux is J = −p′(x) + f (x)p(x) + F0∆p(x) =
const, where p = p+ + p− is the total probability den-
sity, and ∆p = p+ − p−. For the feature-rich GlpF
PMF (Fig. 1) the ﬂux J(F0, T0|p0, p1) = A0(F0, T0)p0 −
A1(F0, T0)p1 needs to be computed numerically, e.g.,
by employing a matrix continued-fraction method. The
computed ﬂux is shown in Fig. 3 as two dimensional
density plots for F0 ∈ [0, 8] and T0 ∈ [10−2, 105] (log-
arithmic scale). In SI units, these values correspond to
F0 ∈ [0, 7.2] pN and T0 ∈ [10−9, 10−2] s, respectively.
The conclusions drawn from Fig. 3 are consistent with
our previous ﬁndings for externally applied deterministic
forces. First, the RTF-induced asymmetry between the
inward and outward ﬂuxes is manifest (Figs. 3a-b), with
bigger outward ﬂux for the same F0, T0 and concentration
gradient. Second, the RTF-induced ﬂux enhancement is
more pronounced for slower ﬂuctuations and for larger
F0. Third, the ﬂux in the absence of a concentration
gradient across the membrane is always outward. Thus,
the ratio of the inner to outer glycerol concentrations at
which glycerol uptake ceases is always less than one, as
shown in Fig. 3c.

Our

calculations have demonstrated that non-
equilibrium force ﬂuctuations acting on glycerol in GlpF
can have an important eﬀect on the glycerol uptake by
a cell. On the one hand, slow, large amplitude ﬂuctua-
tions enhance the concentration gradient-driven glycerol
uptake (Fig. 3a), which may be vital for the cell under

4

poor nutrient conditions. On the other hand, when glyc-
erol is abundant, ﬂuctuations provide an eﬀective pro-
tection mechanism to the cell by stopping glycerol up-
take well before the cytoplasmic concentration reaches
the periplasmic one (Fig. 3c). The mechanism underly-
ing this behavior is related to the ratchet eﬀect and de-
pends sensitively on the asymmetric shape of the PMF
characterizing glycerol conduction in GlpF. The eﬀects
described should be testable experimentally. In fact, re-
cent experiments have demonstrated that cell membranes
are subject to slow, kHz frequency (T0 ∼ 10−2) non-
equilibrium ﬂuctuations that may be related to pumping
mechanisms by which cells supplement the passive diﬀu-
sion of nutrients [4].

(Dated: January 27, 2014)

A general simple theory for the allometric scaling is developed in the d + 1-dimensional space
(d biological lengths and a physiological time) of metabolic states of organisms.
It is assumed
that natural selection shaped the metabolic states in such a way that the mass and energy d + 1-
densities are size-invariant quantities (independent of body mass). The diﬀerent metabolic states
(basal and maximum) are described by considering that the biological lengths and the physiological
time are related by diﬀerent transport processes of energy and mass.
In the basal metabolism,
transportation occurs by balistic and diﬀusion processes. In d = 3, the 3/4 law occurs if the balistic
movement is the dominant process, while the 2/3 law appears when both transport processes are
equivalent. Accelerated movement during the biological time is related to the maximum aerobic
sustained metabolism, which is characterized by the scaling exponent 2d/(2d + 1) (6/7 in d = 3).
The results are in good agreement with empirical data.

Metabolic rate B and body mass M are connected by
the relation B = aM b, where b is the allometric expo-
nent and a is a constant. For several decades it was
accepted that the basal metabolic rate (BMR) among
almost all organisms [1, 2, 3] (interspeciﬁc scaling) was
characterized by b = 3/4 (Kleiber’s law [4]). A few years
ago, theoretical explanations of the ubiquity of the 3/4-
law based on the resource distribution network common
to all organisms [5] and on network geometry optimiza-
tion [6] were proposed. Kleiber’s law has however been
questioned recently. On the observational side, it is not
clear whether the value of b is 3/4, 2/3 or even vari-
able in both interspeciﬁc and intraspeciﬁc (same species)
scaling [7, 8, 9]. On the theoretical side, some mathe-
matical and conceptual errors were found in these mod-
els [7] undermining the rational basis for the scaling
law. A related open question is why maximum aero-
bic sustained metabolic rate (MMR) of endothermic an-
imals scales with an exponent larger than that of BMR
In this work we show how, on the

basis of a few quite general hypotheses, all the aspects
of metabolic scaling mentioned above may be accounted
for. The central assumption of our approach is that, if
one characterizes the metabolic state of an organism as a
point in a space comprised of d biological lengths and a
biological time τ , then the (d + 1)-dimensional mass and
energy densities are size-invariant under natural selec-
tion. Using this idea we may, given the dominant mass
and energy transport processes, obtain dynamical rela-
tions involving lengths and time. The latter are charac-
terized by invariant quantities (diﬀusion coeﬃcient, ve-
locity etc.). Each transport mechanism is related to a
diﬀerent metabolic state, with its own values for allo-
metric exponents, in agreement with data.

The key questions in interspeciﬁc allometry are: (1) Is
there a universal interspeciﬁc BMR exponent b? (2) Is

there a model that can describe both BMR and MMR
scaling? (3) Which quantities have their scaling deter-
mined by the BMR, and which by the MMR?

We present a simple and general theory that answers,
at least partially, these questions and explain some as-
pects of the allometric scaling of organisms. As all biolog-
ical processes depend on characteristic times, it is natural
to include a characteristic time, as well as various charac-
teristic lengths, when specifying the metabolic state of an
organism [13, 14]. We therefore associate the metabolic
state of an organism with a point in a d + 1-dimensional
space with d biological lengths L1, L2 . . . , Ld and a bi-
ological time τ . Here d is the number of spatial dimen-
sions; although we usually have d = 3, we will work in
general dimension d. Examples of biological lengths L
and times τ are the total aorta length in mammals, the
length of capillaries, the mean distance from cell surface
to mitochondria in unicellular organisms, the duration
of one heartbeat, the capillary blood transit time or the
turnover time for glucose [1, 2, 14].

We now look for simple, general relations constrain-
ing the distribution of points in the space of metabolic
states. It is usual for an animal to make several transi-
tions between states Abasal and Amax, through a series
of complex biochemical processes. We do not consider
these transitions. Rather we are interested in describing
how natural selection has shaped the state Abasal and
other ones belonging to the space of metabolic states
of all organisms (or a group of them). An organism
is characterized by the fundamental quantities of mass
and available energy for the metabolic processes. We
therefore identify the mass M and available energy E
as the fundamental variables characterizing an organism.
Since we have a d + 1-dimensional space we shall use the
mass density ρd+1(L1, . . . , Ld, τ ) (mass per unit volume
and unit time) and the energy density σd+1(L1, . . . , Ld, τ )

2

(available energy per unit volume and unit time). We as-
sume that during evolution, natural selection enforces the
constraints of size-invariant (independent of body mass)
ρd+1 and σd+1 (our ﬁrst and second hypotheses, respec-
tively). Our third hypothesis is that the scaling of the
metabolic states is determined by the dominant dynam-
ical transport processes of nutrients (mass and energy),
which are characterized by size-invariant quantities (dif-
fusion coeﬃcient, average velocity, etc.). Note that the
ﬁrst and second hypotheses furnish two relations valid
for all metabolic regimes. Diﬀerent metabolic scalings
will appear because there are diﬀerent ways to transport
nutrients.

From the second hypothesis we obtain that E =
σd+1 τ Vd, where τ Vd is the d + 1-volume and Vd =
L1L2 . . . Ld. Since power is deﬁned as P = dE/dt, energy
can be written in terms of B, the power averaged over the
time scale τ , as E = Bτ . We identify B as the metabolic
rate. Therefore from the ﬁrst and second hypotheses we
obtain that

M = ρd+1 τ Vd,

and B = σd+1 Vd .

(1)

An immediate consequence of our hypotheses is that the
power per mass (speciﬁc metabolic rate), namely

cial to obtain the BMR exponent in the model of West,
Brown and Enquist (WBE) [5].

Since the metabolic rate B involves exchange of nu-
trients at surfaces we write B ∝ Ad, where Ad is the
biological surface area of the organism. From geometri-
cal considerations the maximum surface is proportional
to the volume, namely Ad ∝ Vd (see references [7, 14]).
The relation derived from our second hypothesis, B ∝ Vd
then implies that the organisms have evolved in order to
maximize the exchange surface.

Although, from our third assumption, we need some
dynamical size-invariant quantities, like the blood ﬂow
speed velocity v0 in the aorta or in the capillaries, the
length lc and the radius rc of capillaries are not neces-
sarily invariants.

Let us ﬁrst study the case of transport via diﬀusion.
We have only one metabolic length scale (L1 ∝ L2 ∝
. . . ∝ Ld ∝ L), so the biological volume is given by
Vd ∝ Ld. Since diﬀusion over short distances is fast,
it is possible that the metabolic rate of very small organ-
isms is governed by this process. It is well known that
L = D0τ 1/2, where D0 is the size-invariant diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient. Since τ = (L/D0)2, we obtain from Eq. (1)
that M ∝ Ld+2. This relation furnishes how L depends
on M and we can use again Eq. (1) to obtain that

is inversely proportional to the metabolic time. Ani-
mals with a small τ , such as small mammals, require
larger power by unit mass than ones with a large τ
(large mammals) because their cells have a large mito-
chondrial density [15]. Obviously, τ cannot be 0 neither
∞; there must be a minimal and a maximal metabolic
times τmin and τmax. For animals, a lower bound for
τmin can be found from the observation that the biolog-
ical volume of an organism Vd cannot be larger than its
spatial volume V , since the biological lengths Li charac-
terize the organism’s anatomy on the scale of the body,
or some organ or cellular structure. For compact ani-
mal bodies we have that M = ρV , where ρ is the usual
d-dimensional mass density, which is approximately con-
stant. Using ρV = M = ρd+1 τ Vd in V > Vd, we obtain
τ > τmin = ρ/ρd+1. Since B/M cannot be zero it must
exist an size-invariant (B/M )min related to the mini-
mum power per mass to keep the organisms just alive,
the so-called tissue maintenance speciﬁc metabolic rate
[9]. This implies that τmax = σd+1/(ρd+1(B/M )min).
Note that if τ is size-invariant, we have isometric scaling
of the metabolic rate (b = 1).

The relation M ∝ τ Vd, derived from the ﬁrst hypoth-
esis, is a generalization of the result of Banavar et al.
[6], namely Vnet ∝ Ld+1, where Vnet is the total vol-
ume of an eﬃcient distributive network. Using that the
blood volume Vnet is proportional to mass, they obtained
M ∝ Ld+1, a basic relation to deduce the 3/4-law. The
two relations are equal when τ ∝ L, a condition valid for
the BMR. Moreover, the result M ∝ Ld+1 is also cru-

In d = 3, the metabolic exponent is b = 3/5.

For larger organisms diﬀusion is inadequate. Transport
by convection is then utilized on large length scales. In
mammals, for example, we ﬁnd the cardiovascular system
that transports blood to the capillaries, where the cells
are fed by diﬀusion. Since blood circulates in an inertial
regime, we consider that the BMR is basically limited by
inertial transport, namely L = v0τ , where the velocity v0
is size-invariant. Now we must specify how the diﬀerent
metabolic steps are related. We call BMR-1 the scenario
of a single metabolic relevant length L1 ∝ L = v0τ and
a single time τ , both related to the inertial transport.
The other lengths, related to other metabolic steps, have
evolved to meet it, namely L2 ∝ . . . ∝ Ld ∝ L. Using
that Vd ∝ Ld in Eq. (1), we write

L ∝ τ ∝ M
B ∝ M

For d = 3 we ﬁnd the 3/4-law, namely τ ∝ L ∝ M 1/4
and B ∝ M 3/4. These results are the same as those of
WBE [5].

In the BMR-2 scenario, we have diﬀerent relevant
lengths and times related to the metabolic processes.
However, due to the concept of symmorphosis [16], which
states that all metabolic steps have co-evolved in order
that no step is more limiting than another, we will end
up with a single time τ and d − 1 rescaled lengths. In

a “cylindrical” symmetry we have L1 ∝ L = v0t1 (iner-
1/2
tial term) and d − 1 lengths proportional to R = D0t
2
(diﬀusion). Both v0 and D0 are size-invariant. From
the symmorphosis principle (t1 = t2 = τ ),
it follows

Then in d = 3 the BMR-2 scenario yields the 2/3 law,
without mention of the area/volume ratio. We obtained
both 3/4 and 2/3 laws from the same transport processes:
convection and diﬀusion. If convection is the dominant
limiting process we have the 3/4 law; if the two processes
are equivalent we obtain the 2/3 law.

The circulatory networks of endothermic animals are
dynamical ones which are adjusted according to the
metabolic state. The transition from resting to maxi-
mum activity can be described very brieﬂy as follows:
(a) the heart increases its rate and output; (b) the mean
arterial pressure and peripheral extramuscular resistance
increase; (c) arterial blood volume increases due to con-
striction of the veins; (d) extramuscular ﬂow remains
essentially constant, somewhat reduced in some organs
but increased in others; and (e) total ﬂow and mus-
cular ﬂow increase, with all muscular capillaries acti-
vated. The items (a), (c) and (e) suggest that we have a
“forced movement” during the characteristic time τ . This
means that the typical constant velocity can be written as
v = a0τ , where a0 is a size-invariant acceleration. Con-
sequently the MMR is limited by an inertial movement
accelerated during time τ , implying that L = vτ = a0τ 2.
If inertial transport is the only relevant process (MMR-
1 scenario), it follows that L1 ∝ L2 . . . ∝ Ld ∝ L = a0τ 2.
Since Vd ∝ Ld and τ ∝ L1/2, we obtain from Eq. (1) the
metabolic relations:

L ∝ M
B ∝ M

For d = 3 we have that L ∝ M 2/7, τ ∝ M 1/7 and B ∝
M 6/7. This results agree with the ones obtained trough
a generalization of WBE ideas to MMR scenario [12].

In the MMR-2 scenario, diﬀusion and inertial move-
ment are equally relevant. We again choose a “cylindri-
cal” symmetry so that have that L1 ∝ L = a0τ 2 while
the remaining d−1 lengths are of order D0τ 1/2. It follows
from Eq. (1) that

“aorta” and “capillaries”. Note that the aorta La and

capillary lc lengths are both proportional to L. Since
the nutrient ﬂuid is conserved, the volume rate of ﬂow is
given by

˙Q = πR2

ava = Ncπr2

c vc

,

where Ra and va are the aorta radius and ﬂuid velocity
and Nc, rc and vc are capillary number, radius and ﬂuid
velocity, respectively. It is natural to write that ˙Q ∝ B.
In the basal regime, va and vc are size-invariant. Then
we obtain that Ra ∝ B1/2 and Ncr2
∝ B. Making the
c
extra assumption that rc is invariant, it follows that the
capillary density ρc = Nc/M is ρc ∝ B/M ∝ 1/τ . For
d = 3 we have the following results: (a) BMR-1 - Ra ∝
M 3/8 and ρc ∝ M −1/4; (b) BMR-2 - Ra ∝ M 1/3 and
ρc ∝ M −1/3.
In the maximum regime, we have that
∝ B/τ . Now vc
va = a0τ . Then, we obtain that R2
a
is not necessarily invariant, as in the basal case. Since
ρcr2
c vc ∝ 1/τ we obtain that ρc ∝ 1/τ if we make the
extra assumptions that both vc and rc are independent
of body mass. The results are: (c) MMR-1 - Ra ∝ M 5/14
and ρc ∝ M −1/7; (d) MMR-2 - Ra ∝ M 1/4 and ρc ∝
M −1/4.

Let us compare our predictions for d = 3 with exper-
imental data (see Table I). The values predicted in the

4

MMR-2 context are far from the experimental ones. On
the other hand, the MMR-1 scenario describes very well
the MMR data. The exponent b = 6/7 ≈ 0.86, larger
than the basal value, is in very good agreement with
data. Muscular capillary density of mammals is linked to
MMR, instead of BMR, because only during exercise are
all the muscular capillaries perfused. The capillary den-
sity scales as ρc = Nc/M ∝ M −1/7, in good agreement
with the average experimental value for various regions
of muscle [3, 17]. Since τ ∝ M 1/7, frequencies must scale
as F ∝ τ −1 ∝ M f with f = −1/7 ≈ −0.14. This value,
smaller than the basal one, is also in good agreement
with data for heart and respiration rates in strenuous
exercise. The results for the capillary invariant radius
rc and lc ∝ M 2/7, agree roughly with the theoretical-
(lc ∝ M 0.21 and
empirical estimation of Dawson [18].
rc ∝ M 0.08).

Since the length of aorta cannot change from basal
to maximum metabolic regimes, it should scale as the
prediction of MMR scaling. The predicted exponent 0.29
agrees well with data. The aorta radius could in principle
follow the two scalings because of the elasticity of the
aorta and the dynamical body adaptations of mammals
in the transition BMR - MMR. The experimental value
0.36 has however a better agreement with the MMR-1
value 5/14.

Consider now the predictions of BMR scaling. Re-
cently the empirical values of the BMR exponent of mam-

mals were reanalyzed using diverse procedures [7, 8, 20]
that furnished values in the interval between b2 = 2/3
and b1 = 3/4, which are the predicted values of BMR-
2 and BMR-1, respectively. Heart and respiration rates
are close to the BMR-1 value −1/4 and other biological
variables [5] have values close to multiples of 1/4. On
the other hand, empirical data near multiples of 1/3 are
also reported [9]. Therefore, the two scenarios are pos-
sible. This last possibility explains why b is greater in
large versus small mammals data: diﬀusion and inertial
transports can be equally important in small organisms
(BMR-2) but not in large ones, where inertial transport
is crucial (BMR-1). Moreover, we can also explain qual-
itatively why ectothermic animals have a larger b than
endothermic ones. Since ectothermic animals use an ex-
ternal heat source to regulate their temperature, their
metabolism must be slower than that of endothermic an-
imals. A larger τ implies a larger b exponent. Finally, let
us mention that we can also explain why plants [25] and
mammals in deep torpor with depressed body tempera-
ture [9, 26] have isometric scaling. They are in a state of
very slow metabolism, in such a way that τ ≈ τmax and
the transport mechanism is irrelevant for scaling. Since
τmax is size-invariant we obtain b = 1.

1 Introduction

It is a known observation [1] that a relationship exists between the codons and the physical-

chemical properties (PCP) of the coded amino acids (a.a.). The observed pattern is read either
as a relic of some kind of interaction between the a.a. and the nucleotides at an early stage of

evolution or as the existence of a mechanism relating the properties of codons with those of a.a..
In particular it is observed that the relationship depends essentially on the nature of the second

nucleotide in the codons and it holds when the second nucleotide is adenine (A), uracil (U) or
cytosine (C), not when it is guanine (G). To our knowledge neither the anomalous behaviour of

G nor the existence of a closest relationship between some of the a.a. is understood. It is the
aim of this paper to provide an explanation of both these facts in the framework of the model
of genetic code we have discussed in a previous paper [2], called crystal basis model, as it is

heavily based on the mathematical structure of the modules of the irreducible representations
(IR) of Uq→0[sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)], known in the mathematical literature as crystal basis [3]. After
recalling brieﬂy the model in Sect. 2, we derive in Sect. 3 a set of relations between the PCP of
the amino acids, based on the content of the IRs of the dinucleotides and of the codons coding

for the amino acids. Finally we compare our predictions with the experimental data.

2 The Model

The four nucleotides A, C, G, U are considered as basic states of the ( 1
2) irreducible rep-
resentation of the quantum enveloping algebra Uq[sl(2) ⊕ sl(2)] in the limit q → 0, with the
following assignment of quantum numbers:

2, 1

C ≡ (+ 1

2, + 1
2)

U ≡ (− 1

2 , + 1
2)

G ≡ (+ 1

2, − 1
2)

A ≡ (− 1

2 , − 1
2)

(1)

In this framework, the codons are built as composite states of the nucleotide states by tensoring
three such ( 1
2) representations. Note that the crystal basis, which exists in the limit q → 0
of the q-deformed universal enveloping algebra Uq(G) for any semi-simple Lie algebra G, is the
only way to provide such composite states as pure states, and to ensure the existence of an

2, 1

order in the tensoring procedure.

However, it is well-known (see Table 1) that in a multiplet of codons relative to a speciﬁc

amino acid, the ﬁrst two bases constituent of a codon are “relatively stable”, the degeneracy
being mainly generated by the third nucleotide. Considering the tensor product

2, 1
( 1

2) = (1, 1) ⊕ (1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1) ⊕ (0, 0)

2) ⊗ ( 1

2, 1

(2)

we get, using Kashiwara’s theorem [3], the following tableau:

→ sl(2)H
↓

sl(2)V

(0, 0)

(CA)

( CG UG UA )



CU

GA




(1, 1) 


CC UC UU
GC AC AU
GG AG AA




1

where the subscripts H (:= horizontal) and V (:= vertical) specify the two sl(2).

From Table 1, the dinucleotide states formed by the ﬁrst two nucleotides in a codon can
be put in correspondence with quadruplets, doublets or singlets of codons relative to an amino

acid, the sextets (resp. triplets) being viewed as the sum of a quadruplet and a doublet (resp.
a doublet and a singlet). We deﬁne in our model the “charge” Q of a dinucleotide state by

Q = J3,H + 1

4 CV (J3,V + 1) − 1

4

(3)

The dinucleotide states are then split into two octets with respect to the charge Q: the eight

strong dinucleotides CC, GC, CG, GG, CU, GU, UC, AC associated to the quadruplets (as well
as those included in the sextets) of codons satisfy Q > 0, while the eight weak dinucleotides

AA, AU, UA, UU, UG, AG, CA, GA associated to the doublets (as well as those included in
the triplets) and eventually to the singlets of codons satisfy Q < 0. Let us remark that by the
change C ↔ A and U ↔ G, which is equivalent to the change of the sign of J3,α or to reﬂexion
with respect to the diagonals of the eq. (1), the 8 strong dinucleotides are transformed into
weak ones and vice-versa. Note that a ﬁrst attempt to diﬀerentiate between strong and weak

dinucleotides is contained in ref. [4].

The irreducible representations of the tensor product of ( 1

2)⊗3 as well as the correspon-
dence codons/amino acids for the eukariotic code is reported in Table 1. The upper labels
denote diﬀerent IRs.

2, 1

3 Relationship between the PCP of Amino Acids

We assume that some PCP of a given amino acid are related to the nature of the codons, in
particular they depend on the following mathematical features, written in hierarchical order:

1. the IR of the dinucleotide formed by the ﬁrst two nucleotides;

2. the sign of the charge Q, eq. (3), on the dinucleotide state;

3. the value of the third component of J3,V inside a ﬁxed IR for the dinucleotides;

4. the upper label(s) of the codon IR(s);

Not all the PCP are supposed to follow the scheme above; some of them are essentially given
by the speciﬁc chemical structure of the amino acid itself.

In the following, we analyze the PCP of the amino acids in the light of the dinucleotide

content of the irreducible representations of eq. (2).

– representation (0,0)

The codons of the form CAN (N = C, U, G, A) all belong to the IR ( 1
2 )4 and code for His
and Gln, both being coded by doublets and diﬀering by the value of J3,V . Then we expect that
the PCP of His and Gln are very close.

2, 1

2

– representation (1,0)

i.e. CG (Q > 0), UG,
We analyse now the codons built up by the dinucleotide IR (1, 0).
UA (both Q < 0). The codons CGS (S = C, G), resp. CGW (W = U, A), belonging to IR
(3/2, 1/2)2, resp. (1/2, 1/2)2, all code for Arg, so we do not have any relation. The codons UGS,
resp. UGW, belonging to IR (3/2, 1/2)2, resp. (1/2, 1/2)2, code for Cys (which is a doublet)
and Trp (singlet), resp. the other Cys and Ter (triplets). So we expect the PCP of Cys not
very diﬀerent from those of Trp. The codons UAN, belonging to the IR (3/2, 1/2)2, code for
the Tyr and Ter. So we expect some aﬃnity between the a.a. coded by UGN and UAN, in

particular between Cys and Tyr both being coded by doublets.

– representation (0,1)

The codons built up by the dinucleotide IR (0, 1) are CU, GU (both Q > 0) and GA (Q < 0).
The codons CUY and GUY (Y = C, U), resp. CUR and GUR (R = G, A), belonging to IR
(1/2, 3/2)2, resp. (1/2, 1/2)3, code for Leu and Val. Therefore we do not have any relation
between a.a. coded by the same dinucleotide, but we expect that the PCP of Leu and Val are

close since CU and GU both belong to the same IR and are both strong. The codons GAN
belong to the IR (1/2, 3/2)2 and they code Asp and Glu (both doublets). Then we expect the
PCP of Asp and Glu to be very close.

– representation (1,1)

The dinucleotide IR (1, 1) contains ﬁve states with Q > 0 (CC, UC, GC, AC, GG). The codons
CCN , resp. UCN, belong to four diﬀerent IRs and code for Pro (quartet), resp. Ser (sextets).

We expect an aﬃnity between the PCP of these a.a.. The codons GCN , resp. ACN, belong to
four diﬀerent IRs and code for Ala (quartet), resp. Thr (quartets). We expect a strong aﬃnity

between the PCP of Ala and Thr. The codons GGN belong to two diﬀerent IRs and code for
Gly, so we expect an aﬃnity of PCP of Gly with those of Pro, Ser, Ala, Thr. Now let us look
at the four states with Q < 0 (UU, AU, AG, AA). The codons UUN belong to two diﬀerent

IRs and code for Leu, the doublet subpart of the sextet, and for Phe (doublet). An aﬃnity
is expected between the PCP of these two a.a.. The codons AUN belong to two diﬀerent IRs

and code Ile (triplet) and Met (singlet) and, in fact, the values of PCP of these two a.a. are
not very diﬀerent. The codons AGN belong to two diﬀerent IRs and code for Ser and Arg, the

doublet subpart of the sextet, so an aﬃnity between the PCP of these codons is expected. The
codons AAN belong to the same IR (3/2, 3/2) and code for Asn and Lys, so the values of the

PCP of these a.a. should be close.

Note that for the three sextets (Arg, Leu, Ser) the quartet (doublet) subpart is coded by a

codon with a strong (weak) dinucleotide.

In conclusion we predict the following relations between the values of the PCP of the amino

acids (∼= means strong aﬃnity, ≈ aﬃnity, ∼ weak aﬃnity):

1. His ∼= Gln

2. Asp ∼= Glu

3

3. Asn ∼= Lys ∼ Arg, Ser

4. Cys ∼= Tyr ≈ Trp

5. Leu ∼= Val

6. Pro ∼= Ser ≈ Gly

7. Ala ∼= Thr ≈ Gly, Pro, Ser

8. Ile ∼= Met ≈ Phe

4 Discussion

We have compared our theoretical previsions with 10 physical-chemical properties:

1. the Chou-Fasman conformational parameters [5] Pα, Pβ and Pτ which gives a measure of
the probability of the a.a. to form respectively a helix, a sheet and a turn. However it has
been suggested in [6] that the sum Pα+Pβ is a more appropriate parameter to characterize
the generic structure forming potential while the diﬀerence Pα − Pβ is a more appropriate
parameter for the helix forming potential, which is a quantity more depending on the
particular a.a.. So we compare with Pα + Pβ and Pτ ;

2. the Grantham polarity PG [7];

3. the relative hydrophilicity Rf as computed by Weber and Lacey [8];

4. the thermodynamic activation parameters at 298 K: ∆H (enthalpy, in kJ/mol), ∆G
(free energy, in kJ/mol) and ∆S (entropy, in J/mole/K) as obtained by Siemion and
Stefanowicz [9];

5. the negative of the logarithm of the dissociation constants at 298 K: pKa for the α-COOH

group and pKb for the α-NH+

3 group [10];

6. the isoelectronic point pI [10], i.e. the pH value at which no electrophoresis occurs.

The comparison between the theoretical relations and the experimental values shows (see Tables

2 and 4):

1. His ∼= Gln – The agreement, except for pI, is very good.

2. Asp ∼= Glu – The agreement, except for Pτ , is very good.

3. Asn ∼= Lys ∼ Arg, Ser – The agreement, except for pI and Pτ is very good. The comparison

with the values of PCP of Ser and Arg is satisfactory.

4

4. Cys ∼= Tyr ≈ Trp – Except for Rf , the agreement between the ﬁrst two a.a. is very good,

while with Trp is satisfactory.

5. Leu ∼= Val – The agreement is very good.

6. Pro ∼= Ser ≈ Gly – The agreement is very good, except for Pα + Pβ and ∆H, and with

Gly more than satisfactory.

7. Ala ∼= Thr ≈ Gly, Pro, Ser – The agreement is very good between the ﬁrst two a.a. except

for Pτ and satisfactory with the others except for the conformational parameters.

8. Ile ∼= Met ≈ Phe – The agreement is very good between the ﬁrst two a.a. and satisfactory

with Phe.

In order to have a more quantitative evaluation of the agreement between the data and the the-

oretical model we compute the mean value and the standard deviation of the whole population
(i.e. the twenty amino-acids) for each generic PCP x

in 3 diﬀerent cases:

1. considering all the amino acids, i.e. summing over the whole set of amino acids (n = 20);

2. considering the amino acids coded by the codons with the same second nucleotide (n =

4 for C, n = 5 for U and G, n = 7 for A);

3. considering the couples (n = 2) of amino acids given by our 8 relations.

The results are reported in Tables 2 to 4.

As an estimate of the accurary of our predictions, we compute the sum of the adimensional
quantities given for any PCP by the ratios σx/x of the standard deviation to the average value,
in the three diﬀerent cases considered above.

Values of η = P σx/x

Looking to the table above, we remark that the characterization of the PCP from the nature of
the second nucleotide in the codons is, except for U, indeed not really discriminatory. On the

contrary, the relations derived by our model reduces dramatically the values of our estimate
parameter η = Pi σx/x.

5

From Table 2 we note that the values of the thermodynamical quantities for some amino

acids are not yet measured. Our relations predict that the values of ∆H and −∆S for His
should be around 60 kJ/mol and 120 kJ/mol/K. For the values of Asp and Glu coded by the

unique weak nucleotide GA in the IR (0,1), we do not have any available data to compare with.
However, making the further assumption, supported by an inspection of the available data, that

the values of the thermodynamical quantities depend slightly on the nature of the charge, we
predict that the values of these quantities for Asp and Glu should not be very dissimilar from
the values of the analogous quantities for Leu and Val, coded by the strong dinucleotide CU

an GU in the IR (0,1). So we predict that for Asp and Glu, one should ﬁnd ∆H ≈ 60 kJ/mol,
−∆S ≈ 135 kJ/mol/K and ∆G ≈ 100 kJ/mol.

5 Conlusion

In conclusion, the values of PCP show, with a few exceptions, a pattern of correlations which

is expected from the assumptions done in the crystal basis model. Let us emphasize that the
assignment of the value of the IRs both for the dinucleotide and for the trinucleotide states or

codons is a straightforward consequence of our model. The remarked property that the a.a.
coded by codons whose second nucleotide is G do not share similarity in the properties of PCP
with other a.a. does ﬁnd an explication in the model as it is immediate to verify, looking to the
table of the tensor product of two ( 1
2) that that are no two states with G in second position
which share simultaneously the properties of belonging to the same IR and being characterized

2, 1

by the same value of Q.

A ﬁnal remark:

it has beeen sugested that the physico-chemical properties of the amino
acids have played a fundamental role in the evolution and the organization of the genetic code.

In this framework, a meaure of the relative distances between amino acids has been deﬁned, see
[11] and references therein. The picture which emerges in [11] has some striking conﬁrmations

with the predictions of our model. So we argue that the assignment of codons in multiplets,
corresponding to irreducible representations, may have a deep connection with the evolutionary

organization.

Allometric scaling is one of the most pervasive laws in biology.

Its origin, however, is still a
matter of dispute. Recent studies have established that maximum metabolic rate scales with an
exponent larger than that found for basal metabolism. This unpredicted result sets a challenge that
can decide which of the concurrent hypotheses is the correct theory. Here we show that both scaling
laws can be deduced from a single network model. Besides the 3/4-law for basal metabolism, the
−1/7, and
model predicts that maximum metabolic rate scales as M 6/7, maximum heart rate as M
muscular capillary density as M

−1/7, in agreement with data.

PACS numbers: 87.10.+e,87.23.-n

Metabolic rate B and body mass M are connected
by the scaling relation B = aM b, where a is a con-
stant and b is the allometric exponent. Kleiber’s law [1]
(b = 3/4) characterizes the basal metabolism of almost
all organisms [2, 3, 4], including mammals and birds.
The predominance of quarter-power scaling in biology
is experimentally evident [2, 3, 4] and is supported by
recent theories based on the design of resource distri-
bution networks [5, 6]. Maximum metabolic rate, how-
ever, scales with an exponent somewhat larger than 3/4
(b
0.86) [4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. This result raises the ques-
tion whether the scaling of maximal metabolic rate is
governed by mechanisms diﬀerent from those determin-
ing basal metabolism [4, 8, 9]. Here we reformulate the
ideas of West, Brown and Enquist [5] to show that both
scaling laws can be deduced from a single network model.
Although it was recently demonstrated that the exponent
3/4 cannot be consistently derived from the assumptions
of West et al. [5, 12], we show that, using a diﬀerent set of
assumptions and the appropriate impedances, the model
correctly predicts the 3/4-law for basal metabolism.

≈

The basal and maximum metabolic rates set the limits
of the energetic range of endothermic animals. Consider-
able eﬀort has recently been invested to understand the
scaling of these variables [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16]. In particular, maximal performance is very infor-
mative about animal design since during strenuous exer-
cise the circulatory and respiratory systems are stressed
to their uttermost. Recent studies have established that
maximal metabolic rate (MMR) scales with an exponent
larger than that found for basal metabolism, suggest-
ing that the scaling of MMR is determined by mech-
anisms diﬀerent from those controlling basal metabolic
rate (BMR) [4, 8, 9]. We show that this diﬀerence in the
allometric exponent is a consequence of dynamic adap-
tations in the resource supply network, which are needed
to cope with the distinct demands for oxygen and nutri-
ents. Simple dimensional analysis linking BMR to heat
loss through the surface (claimed to support a 2/3-law for
basal metabolism) [12] and simple geometric arguments
[6] are unable to explain why diﬀerent metabolic states
have diﬀerent allometric exponents.

West, Brown and Enquist (WBE) proposed that the
ubiquity of the 3/4-law lies in the resource distribution
network common to all organisms [5]. In order to esti-
mate the exponent b they make three assumptions: (i)
the network branchs hierarchically to supply all parts of
the organism; (ii) the terminal units, such as the cap-
illares of the circulatory system, are body size indepen-
dent; (iii) natural selection has optimized the network
so that the energy required to distribute resources is
minimal, or, equivalently, the total hydrodynamic re-
sistance (impedance) of the network is minimal. From
these assumptions they conclude that (a) the network is
self-similar (fractal); (b) the network has area-preserving
branching in the ﬁrst generations; (c) blood volume Vb
is proportional to M; and (d) metabolic rate scales with
b = 3/4. Some matematical errors, however, have been
found in the derivation of these results [12]. It turns out
that none of these conclusions can be derived from the
above hypotheses. Nevertheless, the ideas of WBE are
simple and elegant, and will be shown here to predict
correctly the allometric exponents of BMR and MMR
when a diﬀerent set of assumptions is adopted and the
correct impedances are used.

The impedance is not minimal for pulsatile ﬂow in an
elastic tube, nor for an area-preserving branching in a
rigid tube. We therefore reformulate the third hypothe-
sis to state that (iii) the total impedance is minimal with
respect to the radius, length, thickness and elastic modu-
lus of the vessels. In other words, the impedance is min-
imal with respect to all variables, except the branching
ratio n. In addition, we assume that (iv) blood volume
is proportional to M ; (v) the network is fractal; and (vi)
the mass of the arteries is constant for a given M or,
alternatively, (vi) the total elastic energy stored in the
vessels is proportional to M . Hypotheses (iv) and (v)
are supported empirically [2, 3, 12, 17]); assumption (vi)
is discussed below.

Let us consider some aspects of the cardiovascular sys-
tem [18] and their relation to the model. For clarity, we
use the same notation as West et al. [5]. The circulatory
network consists of elastic vessels: the aorta, large ar-
teries, muscular arteries, arterioles and capillaries. Each

vessel is described by a label k related to the branching
level, with k = 0 corresponding to the aorta and k = N to
the capillaries. At each level, each vessel branches into
nk smaller vessels, so that the total number of vessels
Nk at level k is Nk = n0n1 . . . nk−1. In particular, the
number of capillaries is Nc = NN = n0n1 . . . nN −1. After
branching, a vessel has a smaller length (lk+1 < lk) and a
smaller radius (rk+1 < rk) and the network can be char-
acterized by the ratios γk = lk+1/lk and βk = rk+1/rk.
The heart is taken into account by considering an oscilla-
tory pressure p(z, t) = p0 exp[i(ωt
Kz)], where p0 is the
amplitude of the pulse, t is time, z is the distance along
the vessel, K = K1 + iK2 is the complex wavenumber
and ω = 2πf is the angular frequency. The velocity of
the pressure pulse is given by c = ω/K1 = λf , with λ
the wavelength and f the frequency; K2 describes the
damping of the pulse.

−

The thickness hk and the Young’s modulus Ek of the
vessels also depend on the level k. The vessel wall con-
sists, in general, of three layers: the intima, a monolayer
of endothelial cells, the media, consisting of muscle layers,
and the adventitia, which is composed of connective tis-
sue. The elastic properties of the vessels vary principally
due to the variable constitution of the media. Large ar-
teries are distentensible and have a smaller E than mus-
cular ones. Arterioles have a relatively large thickness
and small changes in muscular contraction can induce
radius changes, thus controlling ﬂow to organs. The cap-
illaries have no adventitia or media. Their function is the
exchange between blood and cells.

The circulatory system of endothermic animals is a
dynamical network which is adjusted according to the
metabolic state. In humans, only 20-25% of the muscular
capillaries are perfused during rest, while all are perfused
during exercise. This increase is due to the opening of
terminal arterioles and to the rise in perfusion pressure at
the capillary level. (Note that this implies that muscular
capillary density is linked to MMR, instead of BMR.) At
rest blood ﬂow to skeletal muscles is only a small frac-
tion of the total (15% in humans), but during strenuous
activities it increases to a large fraction (over 90% in
mammals) [8]). Circulating blood volume is also larger
during MMR, since the veins function as a reservoir dur-
ing BMR.

In short, the transition from resting to maximum ac-
tivity can be described as follows: (a) the heart increases
its rate and output; (b) the mean arterial pressure and
peripheral extramuscular resistance increase due to the
sympathetic vasoconstriction; (c) circulating blood vol-
ume increases due to vasoconstriction of the veins; (d)
extramuscular ﬂow remains essentially constant, some-
what reduced in some organs but increased in others; and
(e) total ﬂow and muscular ﬂow increase, with all muscu-
lar capillaries activated. The increase in heart rate and
in circulating blood volume during maximal performance
highlights the elastic nature of the vessels and leads to
distinct allometric exponents for BMR and MMR.

The exponent b of the metabolic rate for a network

with nk = n is obtained as follows. The volume rate of
ﬂow in a tube is ˙Qk = πr2
kuk, where uk is the average
velocity. Since the ﬂuid is conserved we have

Because the quantities related to the capillaries (rc, lc,

Let us now consider a network characterized by the

k+1, the so called space-
ﬁlling condition [5], which ﬁxes the length fraction as
γk = n−1/3
. The ratio βk comes from minimization of the
total impedance Z (third hypothesis). During maximum
performance, the elastic nature of the vessels is important
because circulating blood volume and volume ﬂow take
their largest values. Moreover, heart rate is maximum
and the wavelength λ of the pressure pulse is minimum,
so that we must evaluate a local impedance. Analyzing
the oscillatory motion of a viscous liquid in a thin-walled
elastic tube, Morgan and Kiely [19] and Womersley [20]
showed that the local impedance Zk, deﬁned by

this is equivalent to minimizing Z. Consider the to-

n0, n1, . . . , nN −1 ﬁxed. For an organism of given mass
M , we have to minimize Z, with a given blood vol-
ume Vb, a given mass of thin-walled arteries (Ma =
Pk Nk2πrklkhkρa, ρa is the mass density of the arteries)
and subject to the space-ﬁlling geometry. Deﬁning the
Lagrange multipliers (λb,λk,λa), we minimize the auxil-

Here we have incorporated the constants in the Lagrange

mass density. To continue let us suppose that the Young’s
modulus is the same for all vessels (Ek = E). The re-
quirements ∂F/∂lj = ∂F/∂rj = ∂F/∂hj = 0 straigh-
forwardly lead to βj = n−5/12
and hj/rj = constant.
Using nj = n (hypothesis (v)), we obtain from Eq. (3)
that the exponent for the maximum metabolic rate is
b = 6/7
larger than the basal
value, is in very good agreement with experiment (see
Table I). Additionally, we predict that capillary density
M −1/7 and maximum heart rate as
scales as Nc/M
M −1/7, which is also in good agreement with

data (see Table I).

Until now we have considered only the large arteries.
We must now consider the capillaries. Morgan and Kiely

where C = 8/(√5π). Womersley’s analysis [20] leads
to a similar result. We may then minimize the total
impedance subject to the same restrictions as before, and
within the same approximation (Ek = E). We readily ob-
tain βk = n−1/3
. In order to determine the exponent b,
we employ nk = n and a steplike β, with β = n−5/12 for
k < k∗ and β = n−1/3 for k > k∗, where k∗ is the level
at which the two impedances are comparable. Following
West et al. [5], we ﬁnd that Vb is dominated by the large
vessels, implying that the MMR allometric exponent is
b = 6/7

0.86.

k

So far we have assumed the elastic modulus to be in-
dependent of k. To take the variation of Ek with level
k into account, we need a restriction that depends on
Ek. First, we note that the circumferential tension in
the tube wall is σ = prk/hk, where p is the average ar-
terial pressure. Since for large arteries p does not vary
much, we take p constant. Then, we can study the be-
haviour of the elastic energy stored in the walls, namely
U = R (σ2/2E) dV = (p2/2) Pk(Nkr3
klk/Ekhk). Using
rk/hk constant, we ﬁnd U
M in the case Ek = E. This
∼
proportionality between elastic energy and body mass
can be understood as follows. At each heart beat, the
energy imparted to the blood by the heart [5] is given by
(cardiac output)/(heart rate)
M . Part of this energy
is used to push the blood towards the capillaries, while
another part is stored in the elastic arteries. The latter
is needed to attenuate the pressure pulse, so that blood
ﬂow in the capillaries is smooth, allowing the exchange
of nutrients and gases. Since this process is important
irrespective of body size, hypothesis (vi) seems natural
and is indeed observed in the case Ek = E.

∼

We now show that the same allometric exponent is
found for MMR if we take the total elastic energy pro-
portional to M instead of the mass of arteries. Assuming
that the average arterial pressure has approximately the
same value for all large arteries, we have a new auxiliary
function, namely

Note that we may treat Ekhk as a single variable and that
we have incorporated all constants in the Lagrange mul-
tipliers. Requiring ∂F/∂lj = ∂F/∂rj = ∂F/∂(Ejhj) = 0
gives us βj = n−5/12
and Ejhj/rj = constant. In the
capillary case, we again take the average pressure as con-
stant, since the major pressure drop occurs in the arte-
rioles. Using the impedance in Eq. (7) in the auxiliary

The elastic properties of the vessels are important un-
der heavy exercise. As observed by Womersley [21], on
the other hand, during basal metabolism the vessels can
be approximated as almost rigid tubes because (a) Vb
and ˙Q0 have their minimum functional values, and (b)
heart rate is minimal, while the wavelength of the pres-
sure pulse is maximal. (For example, in humans, where
the aorta length = l0
4 m and
0, 9 m). The volume ﬂow, deﬁned in Eq. (4),
λmax ≈
can be written in terms of ∂p(z, t)/∂z as

If λ >> lk, we have that ∂p/∂z

This is the same impedance found by Womersley [21] for
a rigid tube with an oscillatory pressure gradient when rk
is large and viscous eﬀects are negligible. Now the local
impedance coincides with the hydrodynamic resistance of
the whole tube against ∆p. To obtain β, we must then

If we use this impedance in Eq. (11), we obtain βj =

In summary, recent investigations have established
that maximum metabolic rate scales with an exponent
larger than that of basal metabolism. This suggests that
basal and maximum metabolic rates are governed by dif-
ferent mechanisms. We have shown, however, that both
scaling regimes are predicted by a resource distribution
network model [5] if we take into account the distinct
hydrodynamic and elastic properties of the circulatory
system at each metabolic state. The model correctly pre-
dicts that MMR scales as M 6/7, maximum heart rate as
M −1/7 and muscular capillary density as M −1/7. The
theoretical and experimental basis for the 3/4-law for
basal metabolism were recently questioned by Dodds et
al.
[12]. However, Savage and coworkers extensively
scrutinized the experimental data and conﬁrmed that
quarter-power scaling is pervasive in biology. Here we
have shown that the 3/4-law is correctly predicted by
the WBE model for mammals and birds when a diﬀer-
ent set of assumptions is adopted and the appropriate
impedances are used.

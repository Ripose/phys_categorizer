Interictal spikes and sharp waves in human EEG are characteristic signatures of epilepsy. These
potentials originate as a result of synchronous, pathological discharge of many neurons. The reliable
detection of such potentials has been the long standing problem in EEG analysis, especially after
long-term monitoring became common in investigation of epileptic patients. The traditional deﬁni-
tion of a spike is based on its amplitude, duration, sharpness, and emergence from its background.
However, spike detection systems built solely around this deﬁnition are not reliable due to the pres-
ence of numerous transients and artifacts. We use wavelet transform to analyze the properties of
EEG manifestations of epilepsy. We demonstrate that the behavior of wavelet transform of epilep-
tic spikes across scales can constitute the foundation of a relatively simple yet eﬀective detection
algorithm.

Recordings of human brain electrical activity (EEG)
have been the fundamental tool for studying the dynam-
ics of cortical neurons since 1929. Even though the gist
of this technique has essentially remained the same, the
methods of EEG data analysis have profoundly evolved
during the last two decades. In 1985 Babloyantz et al.
demonstrated that certain nonlinear measures, ﬁrst in-
troduced in the context of chaotic dynamical systems,
changed during slow-wave sleep [1]. The ﬂurry of re-
search work that followed this discovery focused on the
application of nonlinear dynamics in quantifying brain
electrical activity during diﬀerent mental states, sleep
stages, and under the inﬂuence of the epileptic process
(for a review see for example [2, 3]).
It must be em-
phasized that a straightforward interpretation of neu-
ral dynamics in terms of such nonlinear measures as the
largest Lyapunov exponent or the correlation dimension
is not possible since most biological time series, such as
EEG, are nonstationary and consequently do not sat-
isfy the assumptions of the underlying theory. On the
other hand, traditional power spectral methods are also
based on quite restrictive assumptions but nevertheless
have turned out to be successful in some areas of EEG
analysis. Despite these technical diﬃculties, the number
of applications of nonlinear time series analysis has been

growing steadily and now includes the characterization of
encephalopaties [4], monitoring of anesthesia depth [5],
characteristics of seizure activity [6], and prediction of
epileptic seizures [7]. Several other approaches are also
used to elucidate the nature of electrical activity of the
human brain ranging from coherence measures [8, 9] and
methods of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics [10] to
complexity measures [11, 12].

One of the most important challenges of EEG analy-
sis has been the quantiﬁcation of the manifestations of
epilepsy. The main goal is to establish a correlation be-
tween the EEG and clinical or pharmacological condi-
tions. One of the possible approaches is based on the
properties of the interictal EEG (electrical activity mea-
sured between seizures) which typically consists of lin-
ear stochastic background ﬂuctuations interspersed with
transient nonlinear spikes or sharp waves. These tran-
sient potentials originate as a result of a simultaneous
pathological discharge of neurons within a volume of at
least several mm3.

The traditional deﬁnition of a spike is based on its
amplitude, duration, sharpness and emergence from its
background [13, 14]. However, automatic epileptic spike
detection systems based on this direct approach suﬀer
from false detections in the presence of numerous types
of artifacts and non-epileptic transients. This shortcom-
ing is particularly acute for long-term EEG monitoring
of epileptic patients which became common in 1980s. To
reduce false detections Gotman and Wang [15] made the
process of spike identiﬁcation dependent upon the state
of EEG (active wakefulness, quiet wakefulness, desyn-

chronized EEG, phasic EEG, and slow EEG). This modi-
ﬁcation leads to signiﬁcant overall improvement provided
that state classiﬁcation is correct.

Diambra and Malta [16] adopted nonlinear prediction
for epileptic spike detection. They demonstrated that
when the model’s parameters are adjusted during the
“learning”phase to assure good predictive performance
for stochastic background ﬂuctuations, the appearance
of an interictal spike is marked by a very large forecast-
ing error. This novel approach is appealing because it
makes use of changes in EEG dynamics. One expects
good nonlinear predictive performance when the dynam-
ics of the EEG interval used for building up the model is
similar to the dynamics of the interval used for testing.
However, it is uncertain at this point whether it is possi-
ble to develop a robust spike detection algorithm based
solely on this idea.

As Clark et al. put it succinctly, automatic EEG anal-
ysis is a formidable task because of the lack of “...features
that reﬂect the relevant information ”[17]. Another dif-
ﬁculty is the nonstationary nature of the spikes and the
background in which they are embedded. One technique
developed for the treatment of such nonstationary time
series is wavelet analysis [18, 19]. The goal of this paper
is to characterize the epileptic spikes and sharp waves in
terms of the properties of their wavelet transforms. In
particular, we search for features which could be impor-
tant in the detection of epileptic events.

The wavelet transform is an integral transform for
which the set of basis functions, known as wavelets, are
well localized both in time and frequency. Moreover, the
wavelet basis can be constructed from a single function
ψ(t) by means of translation and dilation:

ψa;t0 = ψ

ψ(t) is commonly referred to as the mother function or
analyzing wavelet. The wavelet transform of function
h(t) is deﬁned as

The above convolution can be evaluated for any of N
values of the time index n. However, by choosing all N
successive time index values, the convolution theorem al-
lows us to calculate all N convolutions simultaneously in
Fourier space using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT).

taneously [20].
It should be emphasized that formally
equation (5) does not yield the discrete linear convolu-
tion corresponding to (3) but rather a discrete circular
convolution in which the shift n′
n is taken modulo
N . However, in the context of this work, this problem
does not give rise to any numerical diﬃculties. This is
because, for purely practical reasons, the beginning and
the end of the analyzed part of data stream are not taken
into account during the EEG spike detection.

which is particularly suitable for studying epileptic
events.

In the top panel of Fig. 1 we present two pieces of
the EEG recording joined at approximately t = 1s. The
digital 19 channel recording sampled at 240 Hz was ob-
tained from a juvenile epileptic patient according to the
international 10-20 standard with the reference average
electrode. The epileptic spike in this ﬁgure (marked by
the arrow) is followed by two artifacts. The bottom panel
of Fig. 1 displays the contour map of the absolute value
of Mexican hat wavelet coeﬃcients W (a, t0).
It is ap-
parent that the red prominent ridges correspond to the
position of either spike or the motion artifacts. What
is most important, for small scales, a, the values of the
wavelet coeﬃcients for the spike’s ridge are much larger
than those for the artifacts. The peak value along the
spike ridge corresponds to a = 7. In sharp contrast, for
the range of scales used in Fig. 1 the absolute value of
coeﬃcients W (a, t0) for the artifacts grow monotonically
with a.

The question arises as to whether the behavior of the
wavelet transform as a function of scale can be used to
develop a reliable detection algorithm. The ﬁrst step in
this direction is to use the normalized wavelet power

w(a, t0) = W 2(a, t0)/σ2

(7)

instead of the wavelet coeﬃcients to reduce the depen-
dence on the amplitude of the EEG recording.
In the
above formula σ2 is the variance of the portion of the sig-
nal being analyzed (typically we use pieces of length 1024
for EEG tracings sampled at 240 Hz). In actual numeri-
cal calculations we prefer to use the square of w(a, t0) to

merely increase the range of values analyzed during the
spike detection process. In Fig. 2 w2 for the signal used
in Fig. 1 is plotted for three scales A = 3, B = 7 and
C = 20.

In the most straightforward approach, we identify an
EEG transient potential as a simple or isolated epileptic
spike if and only if:

the value of w2 at a = 7 is greater than a predeter-

mined threshold value T1,

the square of normalized wavelet power decreases

from scale a = 7 to a = 20,

the value of w2 at a = 3 is greater than a predeter-

•

•

•

mined threshold value T2.

The threshold values T1 and T2 may be considered as
the model’s parameters which can be adjusted to achieve
the desired sensitivity (the ratio of detected epileptic
events to the total number of epileptic events present
in the analyzed EEG tracing) and selectivity (the ratio
of epileptic events to the total number of events marked
by the algorithm as epileptic spikes).

While this simple algorithm is quite eﬀective for simple
spikes such as one shown in Fig. 1 it fails for the com-
mon case of an epileptic spike accompanied by a slow
wave with comparable amplitude. The example of such
complex is given in Fig. 3(a). The overlap of the neg-
ative tail of the Mexican hat with the slow wave yields
the inherently low values of w2 at scale A (panel (b)) and
scale B (panel (c)) as compared to those characteristic of
the “isolated”spike. Nevertheless, the normalized wavelet
power does decrease from scale B to C. Consequently,
in the same vein as the argument we presented above,
we can develop an algorithm which detects the epileptic
spike in the vicinity of a slow wave by calculating the
following linear combination of wavelet transforms:

˜W (a, t0) = c1W (a, t0) + c2W (as, t0 + τ )

(8)

and checking whether the square of corresponding nor-
malized power ˜w(a, t0) = ˜W 2(a, t0)/σ2at scales a = 3
and a = 7 exceeds the threshold value ˜T1 and ˜T2, respec-
tively. The second term in (8) allows us to detect the
slow wave which follows the spike. The parameters as
and τ are chosen to maximize the overlap of the wavelet
with the slow wave. For the Mexican hat we use as = 28
and τ = 0.125s. By varying the values of coeﬃcients c1
and c2, it is possible to control the relative contribution
of the spike and the slow wave to the linear combination

(8).

For testing purposes, we built up the database of arti-
facts and spikes. We made available some of these EEG
tracings at [21] along with the examples of the numeri-
cal calculations. While the analysis of the pieces of EEG
recordings such as those shown in Fig. 2 and 3 is essential
in determining the generic properties of epileptic events,
it can hardly reﬂect the diﬃculties one can encounter
in interpretation of clinical EEG. Therefore we selected
four challenging EEG tracings with 340 epileptic events.
The algorithm described in this work marked 356 events
out of which 239 turned out to be the epileptic events.
Thus the sensitivity of the algorithm was 70% and its se-
lectivity was equal to 67%. We then analyzed the same
tracings with the leading commercial spike detector de-
veloped by the Persyst Development Corporation (In-
sight 2001.07.12). This software marked 654 events out
of which 268 were epileptic events. Thus slightly better
sensitivity of 79% was achieved at the expense of the low
41% selectivity. The performance of preliminary numeri-
cal implementation of the detection algorithm presented
in this work is excellent and allows to process 24 hour
EEG recording (19 channels sampled at 240 Hz) in a
matter of minutes on the average personal computer.

The goal of wavelet analysis of the two types of spikes,
presented in this paper, was to elucidate the approach
to epileptic events detection which explicitly hinges on
the behavior of wavelet power spectrum of EEG signal
across scales and not merely on its values. Thus, this
approach is distinct not only from the detection algo-
rithms based upon discrete multiresolution representa-
tions of EEG recordings [22, 23, 24, 25, 26] but also from
the method developed by Senhadji and Wendling which
employs continuous wavelet transform [27].

Epilepsy is a common disease which aﬀects 1-2% of
the population and about 4% of children [28]. In some
epilepsy syndromes interictal paroxysmal discharges of
cerebral neurons reﬂect the severity of the epileptic dis-
order and themselves are believed to contribute to the
progressive disturbances in cerebral functions (eg. speech
impairment, behavioral disturbances) [29]. In such cases
precise quantitative spike analysis would be extremely
important. The epileptic event detector described in this
paper was developed with this particular goal in mind
and its application to the studies of the Landau-Kleﬀner
syndrome will be presented elsewhere.

Abstract

Mitochondria are large-scale regulators of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+)
under normal cellular conditions.
In this paper we model the complex
behavior of mitochondrial calcium during the action of inositol 1,4,5-
trisphosphate (IP3) on a single cell and ﬁnd results that are in good
agreement with recent experimental studies. We also study the inﬂuence
of the cellular network connectivity on intercellular signalling via gap junc-
tion diﬀusion. We include in our model the dependence of the junctional
conductivity on the cytosolic calcium concentrations in adjacent cells. We
consider three diﬀerent mechanisms of calcium wave propagation through
gap junctions: via Ca2+ diﬀusion, IP3 diﬀusion, and both Ca2+ and IP3
diﬀusion. We show that IP3 diﬀusion is the mechanism of Ca2+ wave
propagation and that Ca2+ diﬀusion is the mechanism of synchronization
of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in adjacent cells. We also study the role of
diﬀerent topological conﬁgurations of cellular connectivity on these phe-
nomena and show that within the context of the model diﬀerent topolog-
ical structures play an important role in calcium wave propagation.

Key words:Calcium waves, mitochondrion, gap junction, network connec-

1 Introduction

The capacity of mitochondria for accumulating Ca2+ down the electrical gra-
dient generated by the respiratory chain has been known for several decades.
However, the physiological signiﬁcance of this phenomenon has been a subject of
debate during much of the ensuing period. For a long time it was believed that
the low aﬃnity of the mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters, such as electrogenic
uniporters and electroneutral antiporters, would allow a signiﬁcant uptake only
under conditions of dangerously high, cellular Ca2+ overload (for a review see
Pozzan et al. (1994), Carafoli (2003)). In this case, there is a rapid mitochon-
drial accumulation of calcium, driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential
and the fact that calcium possesses a very active electrogenic transport system.
However, in recent years it has been shown that in some cells mitochondria do
take up calcium ions at apparently physiological levels of calcium in the cytosol,
thus establishing mitochondria as large-scale regulators of cytosolic Ca2+ under
normal cellular conditions. A variety of experimental studies have helped con-
ﬁrmed this, including establishing the important concept of Ca2+ microdomains
(Rizzuto et al., 1998). For example, the direct measurement of Ca2+ concen-
tration in the mitochondrial matrix revealed signiﬁcant Ca2+ concentration in-
creases upon agonist stimulation (Hajnoczky et al., 1995), (Thayer and Miller,
1990). Rizzuto et al. (2000) showed that in HeLa cells physiological stimuli act-
ing on Gq-coupled receptors (that thus caused the release of Ca2+ from the ER)
produced a large, rapid rise in Ca2+ concentration in the mitochondrial matrix
that greatly exceeded that of the cytoplasm.
In addition, Arnaudeau et al.
(2001) showed that during stimulation with IP3-generating agonists, HeLa cells
maintain Ca2+ concentrations in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) well above
depleted levels, in phase with elevations of mitochondria and cytosolic Ca2+
concentration. The increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration displayed an
oscillatory behavior. A similar decrease of the ER Ca2+ concentration level dur-
ing incubation with IP3 was observed in hepatocytes (Hajnoczky and Thomas,
1997).

More complex results were obtained in other experiments. Kaftan et al.
(2000) showed that mitochondria sequestered Ca2+ ions and tuned the fre-
quency of oscillations of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in rat gonadotropes.
Mitochondria accumulated Ca2+ rapidly and in phase with elevations of cy-
tosolic Ca2+ concentration after gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stim-
ulation (binding of GnRH to its cell surface receptors) induced oscillations of
cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. These oscillations are driven primarily by the re-
lease and re-uptake of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores (Stojilkovic et al.,
1994), (Hille et al., 1995). The mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration continued to
increase over the course of several oscillations and remained elevated for many

2

minutes, even after the oscillations ceased and the cytosolic Ca2+ concentra-
tion returned to near basal levels. Furthermore, it was found that inhibiting
the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by the protonophore CCCP, which should col-
lapse the mitochondrial membrane potential and eliminate the electrical driving
force for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, reduced the frequency of GnRH-induced
oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.

Mitochondria also participate actively in calcium signalling (for a review see
Babcock and Hille (1998), Duchen (1999), Rutter and Rizzuto (2000)). Mito-
chondria take up calcium very eﬃciently and contribute to the local nature of the
calcium signal by acting as a buﬀer barrier between cellular regions (Tinel et al.,
1999). Importantly, mitochondria are often in close contact with Ca2+ release
sites in the endoplasmic reticulum (Simpson et al., 1997), (Rizzuto et al., 1998)
or with Ca2+ inﬂux channels at the plasma membrane (Hoth et al., 1997). By
acting as a Ca2+ buﬀering system at these strategic locations, mitochondria can
modulate the rate of Ca2+ release by IP3 receptors (Babcock et al., 1997).

In many cases, the strength of the activating stimulus is conveyed to the cell
by the frequency rather than the amplitude of the oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+
concentration, which has given rise to the concept of frequency-modulated Ca2+
signalling (Berridge et al., 1988), (Goldbeter, 1996). For example, Hajnoczky and Thomas
(1997) shown that in hepatocytes, stepped increases in IP3 concentration in-
creased the oscillation frequency, with little change in the kinetics or amplitude
of the individual spikes of ER Ca2+ concentration. One of the ﬁrst models
of frequency encoding of Ca2+ oscillations was proposed by Goldbeter et al.
(1990) (see also Dupont and Goldbeter (1989)). This is a minimal model, which
contains only two variables, Ca2+ concentration in cytosol (Cacyt) and Ca2+
concentration in endoplasmic reticulum (CaER), based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+
release from an intracellular store (ER). The analysis of this model shows how
signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be eﬀectively encoded in terms of their
frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase
activated by cytosolic Ca2+.

A few theoretical studies exist whose goal is to understand better the con-
tribution of the mitochondrion to intracellular calcium signalling and the eﬀect
of this signalling on mitochondrial function. Meyer and Stryer (1988) were the
ﬁrst to include mitochondria in a model of intracellular calcium signaling. Sub-
sequently Marhl et al. (1998) showed that mitochondria played a role in the
regulation of the amplitude during Ca2+ oscillations. In this study, mitochon-
dria act as buﬀers eﬀectively limiting the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations and
keeping the amplitude constant. Grubelnik et al. (2001) also showed that the
amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations is regulated by the sequestration of Ca2+ in the
mitochondria. In another study, Fall and Keizer (2001) integrated a well estab-
lished model of the ER mediated IP3-dependent Ca2+ signalling with a detailed
model of mitochondrial calcium handling and metabolic function. This model
was shown to lead to oscillatory behavior in an otherwise bistable IP3 model;
it also has the virtue of being readily modiﬁable.

In this study we expand the model of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations proposed
by Marhl et al. (2000) to understand better the physiological role of mitochon-

3

drial and the cytosolic proteins. The model of Marhl et al. (2000) does not
agree with certain experimental results (Arnaudeau et al., 2001), (Kaftan et al.,
2000), since there are some qualitative diﬀerences in the dynamics of both the
cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration levels. We believe that these
diﬀerences might be due to the absence of ﬂuxes through the plasma membrane
in their model. Thus, one goal of this work is to test this assumption. We
also extend our model to include gap junction tunnelling between several cou-
pled cells, to study the role of IP3 and Ca2+ diﬀusion in wave propagation and
intercellular synchronization, respectively.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we describe the model
for a single cell, which involves several coupled diﬀerential equations for the
global concentrations of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria
and cytosol, as well as buﬀering proteins in the cytosol. IP3 is the control
parameter for the system, and is assumed to be produced by an external stimulus
not treated explicitly in the model. In the following section 3 we describe the
extension of the model to include gap junction coupling between several nearby
cells. In sections 4 and 5 we discuss the results for the single and coupled cells,
respectively, comparing our simulation results with several experimental studies.
In section 6 we discuss the bursting properties observed for the single cell, which
in general do not correspond to a limit cycle behavior. Finally in section 7 we
provide a short conclusion, including directions for future work.

2 Description of the model

2.1 Schematic description

A schematic description of the model is presented in Fig. 1. There are three
areas shown, the Cyt (cytosol), the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), and the M it
(mitochondria), as well as ﬁve variables, P r (the concentration of calcium bind-
ing proteins in the cytosol), CaP r (the concentration of bounded Ca2+ binding
sites on the cytosolic proteins), Cacyt (concentration of Ca2+ in cytosol), CaER
(concentration of Ca2+ in endoplasmic reticulum), and Cam (concentration of
Ca2+ in mitochondria). Thus the interactions between cytosolic, mitochondria
and ER Ca2+ are included in the model. The inﬂuence of cytosolic Ca2+-
binding proteins on intracellular calcium oscillations in the model is also in-
cluded. Finally, we include in the model the inﬂuence of ﬂuxes through the
plasma membrane of the cell, since we believe that these ﬂuxes play an im-
portant role in certain types of cells (Arnaudeau et al., 2001), (Kaftan et al.,
2000).

In the model of Marhl et al. (2000) there is only one control parameter, kch,
which represents the maximal permeability of the Ca2+ channels in the ER
membrane. However, IP3-mediated Ca2+ release plays a fundamental role in
many cell signalling processes. Therefore we add to the model the eﬀect of
IP3 on the system by changing kch to kchIP3, where IP3 is the concentration
of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the cell. Also the Ca2+ entry through the

4

plasma membrane into the cell depends on IP3 (see Table 1). The eﬀect of
IP3 on the system is described by trapezoidal impulses of diﬀerent amplitudes,
which corresponds to external stimuli of diﬀerent concentrations of agonists.
Modeling the IP3 by trapezoids is a numerically convenient form, rather than
using a square well, for example.

One particularly useful aspect of the model is that it is constructed using a
modular approach (Fall and Keizer, 2001). Thus, individual mechanisms were
developed and tested against experimental data. We want to emphasize, there-
fore, that the modular construction of the model makes it relatively easy to
exchange particular mechanisms or to extend the model with features that have
not been included as part of this work.

2.2 Summary of the model

• We used the Marhl et al. (2000) model as the basis for the mitochondrial

and ER functions.

• We incorporated the Hofer et al. (2002) model for ionic ﬂuxes through the

inner membrane of the cell.

• We added to the model the eﬀect of IP3 on the system as a sequence of

trapezoidal impulses of equal or diﬀerent amplitudes.

• Due to the ionic ﬂuxes through the inner membrane of cell the system is
open and the conservation law for the total cellular calcium concentration
fail. Therefore we formulate the time dependence of the bound Ca2+ and
unbound proteins in terms of explicit diﬀerential equations.

2.3 Model ﬂuxes and diﬀerential equations

All the ﬂuxes incorporated into this model are shown in Fig. 1. The Ca2+
entry rate expression accounts for a small leak ﬂux that is always present and
an agonist-dependent inﬂux, which can be receptor-operated or store-operated
Ca2+ inﬂux, or both (Dupont and Goldbeter, 1993). For simplicity, the latter
is made a function of IP3 concentration as a measure of the agonist dose (see
Jin in Table 1). Calcium extrusion is modeled by a linear rate law (see Jout in
Table 1).

Two diﬀerent calcium ﬂuxes for the ER are included in the model: the ATP-
dependent calcium uptake from the cytosol into the ER with an additional Ca2+
leak ﬂux from the ER into the cytosol (see Jrel in Table 1) and the Ca2+ eﬄux
from the ER through channels following the calcium-induced calcium release
(CICR) mechanism (see Jch in Table 1).

The exchange of Ca2+ between the mitochondria and the cytosol is de-
scribed by the following Ca2+ ﬂuxes: an active Ca2+ uptake by mitochondrial
uniporters (see Jmi in Table 1), calcium release through N a+/Ca2+ exchang-
ers combined with a ﬂux through the mitochondrial permeability transition
pores (PTPs) and a very small non-speciﬁc leak ﬂux (see Jmo in Table 1). The

5

complete expressions for these ﬂuxes are given in Table 1. The values for the
cytosolic, mitochondrial and ER parameters have been taken from Alberts et al.
(1994).

The evolution of the system is governed by the following diﬀerential equa-

tions (for parameter values see Table 2):

3 Modeling of gap junctions between cells

We now discuss extending our model to include gap junction tunnelling between
nearby cells. This is necessary in order to describe the experimentally observed
synchronization of cytosolic Ca2+ between nearby cells (Clair et al., 2001) as
well as calcium wave propagation among several cells (Evans and Sanderson,
1999). Sneyd et al. (1995) hypothesized that the intercellular calcium waves
propagated in airway epithelial cells was due to the diﬀusion of IP3 through
gap junctions. This idea also was used in a model of intercellular calcium waves
in hepatocytes (Dupont et al., 2000). Alternative models of intercellular calcium
waves in hepatocytes were based on the diﬀusion of cytosolic calcium through
gap junctions Hofer (1999) and on the action of calcium as a second messenger in
paracrine signal transduction (Gracheva and Gunton, 2003). Stochastic versions
of all these models are given by Gracheva et al. (2001). In all these models the
junctional permeability was chosen to be a constant parameter. However, since
calcium ions can close gap junctions, this would appear to pose an obstacle to
the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves via gap junctions. Fortunately, this
apparent paradox can be resolved by considering the temporal aspects of these
responses. It is known that extended exposure to high concentrations of Ca2+
(> 10µM ) results in the closure of gap junctions (Bennett and Verselis, 1992),
(Saez et al., 1993). It also appears that physiological concentrations of Ca2+ can
reversibly close gap junctions but this response takes about 40s (Lazrak et al.,
1994). Thus, because Ca2+ waves propagate faster than the proposed closure
times (Sanderson et al., 1990), the two possible intercellular messengers (Ca2+
and IP3) can diﬀused to adjacent cells to propagate the wave before Ca2+ closes
the gap junctions. Therefore, it would seem that a more accurate description of

6

the gap junction permeability requires take into account its dependence on the
cytosolic calcium concentration, rather than treating it as a constant as in the
earlier work.

Thus we choose the junctional conductivity to be the following function of

the cytosolic calcium concentration diﬀerence between adjacent cells i and j:

γCa(ij) =

k5
Ca(ij)
cytMax(ij) + k5
G

.

Ca5

γIP (ij) =

k5
IP (ij)
cytMax(ij) + k5
G

,

Ca5

We also choose the junctional conductivity for IP3 between adjacent cells i and
j to be

where CacytMax(ij) is the maximum concentration of cytosolic calcium between
cells i and j. For other parameters see Table 2.

In this case the system of equations that describes calcium wave propagation

between several (2-3) cells is

dCacyt(i)
dt

= Jin −Jout +Jrel −Jserca+Jmo −Jmi+k−CaP r(i) −k+Cacyt(i)P r(i)+

+γCa(ij)(Cacyt(j) − Cacyt(i)) + γCa(ik)(Cacyt(k) − Cacyt(i)),

dCaER(i)
dt

=

βER
ρER

(Jserca − Jrel)+

+γCa(ij)(Cacyt(j) − Cacyt(i)) + γCa(ik)(Cacyt(k) − Cacyt(i)),
dCam(i)
dt

(Jmi − Jmo) + γCa(ij)(Cacyt(j) − Cacyt(i))+

βm
ρm

=

+γCa(ik)(Cacyt(k) − Cacyt(i)),

dCaP r(i)
dt
dP r(i)
dt

= k+Cacyt(i)P r(i) − k−CaP r(i),

= −k+Cacyt(i)P r(i) + k−CaP r(i),

dIP3(i)
dt

= −Jdeg + γIP (ij)(IP3(j) − IP3(i)) + γIP (ik)(IP3(k) − IP3(i)),

where indices i, j and k denote the cell number.

The case in which the index pairs (ijk) = (120) = (210), with kCa(13) =
kCa(23) = 0 and kIP (13) = kIP (23) = 0 corresponds to just two coupled cells.
Also the case in which (ijk) = (100), CacytMax(ij) = Cacyt(1) and all junctional
coeﬃcients are equal to zero corresponds to only one cell, which is equivalent
to equations (1)-(5).
It is also worth noting that in the case of index pairs
(ijk) = (123) = (213) = (312) there are two possible diﬀerent conﬁgurations
of coupled cells. If none of the junctional coeﬃcients vanish, each cell interacts

7

with two other cells (see Fig. 2a). If kCa(13) = kIP (13) = 0, we have a one-
dimensional chain of cells, with the ﬁrst cell interacting only with the second
cell, the second cell interacting with both the ﬁrst and third cells and the third
cell interacting only with the second cell (see Fig. 2b). The right side of Fig. 2
shows graphs that correspond to these two conﬁgurations.

The system can be easily generated to the case of more than three cells. For
example, the main conﬁgurations of four coupled cells are shown in Fig. 3, not
all of which are biologically realistic in two dimensions. For example, although
conﬁguration A in Fig. 3 is not biologically realistic in two dimensions, it
does correspond to a realistic version in three dimensions (three cells in the
plane and one on top of them, forming a pyramid). However, we consider only
two-dimensional conﬁgurations of cells in this paper, since calcium signaling
in three-dimensional tissues is a separate ﬁeld of research (which we plan to
study in a subsequent work). We include conﬁgurations such as A in our two
dimensional study in order to understand in more detail the important role of
connectivity in synchronization and propagation.

It is also important to note that in order to model Ca2+ wave propagation
the stimulus IP3 (which mimics the mechanical stimulation or local application
of a stimulus) acts only on the ﬁrst cell. We include this action as a trapezoidal
function of time for the ﬁrst cell. Also, in this case we add to the model a term
describing the degradation of IP3 (Sneyd et al., 1995) in each of the cells:

Jdeg =

VpIP3kp
kp + IP3

.

Without this term, the calcium levels reach unphysiological values in the asymp-
totic time limit. The values of all the parameters are given in Table 2.

4 Results for single cell

First of all, we calculated the ratio between the amplitudes of the increase
of calcium concentrations in the mitochondria and cytosol, and also studied
their synchronization. As expected (Rizzuto et al., 2000), during a brief action
of IP3 (resulting from an external stimulus), there was an increase in Cacyt,
together with an increase in Cam; Cam exceeded that of Cacyt by an order of
magnitude (see Fig. 4). We also found an oscillatory decrease of the CaER level
during a prolonged action of IP3 (see Fig. 5), in agreement with experimental
observations (Arnaudeau et al., 2001), (Hajnoczky and Thomas, 1997). At the
same time, Cam rapidly increased, in phase with the oscillatory increase of
Cacyt and a concomitant decrease of CaER; the Cam level remained elevated
for about four minutes even after the oscillations ceased and Cacyt returned to
its basal level (see Fig. 5), consistent with previous observations (cf. Fig. 3
(Kaftan et al., 2000)).

In another interesting study Kaftan et al. (2000) added the protonophore
CCCP, which should collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential and elim-
inate the electrical driving force for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. In this case,

8

an application of CCCP during periodic Ca2+ oscillations dramatically slowed
the rate of each downstroke of Cacyt and reduced the frequency of oscillations.
In our model, this procedure is equivalent to setting kmi = 0. Accordingly, we
found that during kmi = 0 (point B, Fig. 6) the frequency of Cacyt oscilla-
tions was signiﬁcantly reduced in comparison with its behavior for the normal
value of kmi (points A and C, Fig. 6). Our results are in mixed agreement
with the experimental study Kaftan et al. (2000), since the period of Cacyt os-
cillation increased during the application of CCCP (cf. their Fig. 1), whereas
ours decreased. However, the amplitude of the oscillation increased in both the
experiment and simulation.

5 Results for coupled cells

We begin by discussing the case of three coupled cells, because two coupled
cells is just a special case of three coupled cells. There are two possible dif-
ferent conﬁgurations of interactions between three cells (see Fig. 2). For each
conﬁguration we consider three diﬀerent mechanisms for the transduction of
calcium signals between cells: diﬀusion of only IP3, of only Ca2+ and of both
IP3 and Ca2+ through gap junctions between cells. In the case of only Ca2+
diﬀusion there is no calcium wave propagation between cells (these results are
not shown). In the case of only IP3 diﬀusion we ﬁnd that calcium oscillations
are generated in the neighboring cells, but these oscillations are not synchronous
with the calcium oscillations in the ﬁrst cell (see Fig. 7 and Fig. 9). Note that
the total IP3 in the cells are shown in Fig. 7 – 13. Finally, when both Ca2+
and IP3 diﬀuse we ﬁnd not only calcium oscillations in neighboring cells, but
these oscillations are synchronous with the oscillations in the ﬁrst cell (see Fig.
8 and Fig. 10). Therefore we conclude that there are two separate mechanisms
involved. In the ﬁrst case, IP3 diﬀusion provides the mechanism for calcium
wave propagation between cells, as was proposed by (Sneyd et al., 1995). Diﬀu-
sion of Ca2+, however, is necessary in addition to IP3 diﬀusion, to synchronize
the oscillations among the neighboring cells.

As regards the two diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the three cells, one can see
from the results that the propagation of calcium waves depends on the spatial
conﬁguration of cells. If the location of the two neighboring cells is symmetric
with respect to the ﬁrst cell (Fig. 2a), than one can see similar oscillations
in both the second and third cells, following an initial delay from the onset
of oscillations in the ﬁrst cell of about 50s (see Fig. 7 and Fig. 8).
In the
other case (a linear chain) there is a diﬀerence in the calcium oscillations in the
second and third cells. There is not only a delay between the onset of calcium
oscillations in the ﬁrst and second cells, but also between the second and third
cells (both delay times are about 50s). The value of this delay time diﬀers
from that found in Sneyd et al. (1995), Sanderson et al. (1990), but is likely
due to the diﬀerence between the choice of parameter values in the two studies.
Our interest is in obtaining qualitative results that show how the intercellular
connectivity inﬂuences intercellular calcium signaling.

9

Also, we brieﬂy summarize the results for the case of four cells. The results
for the most interesting conﬁgurations of four cells are shown in Fig. 11 –
13. In the case of conﬁguration G (Fig. 3g) the ﬁrst cell has two connections
with other cells (there are four connections between all cells) and we ﬁnd very
good calcium wave propagation between cells. In the case of conﬁguration D
(Fig. 3d) the ﬁrst cell has only one connection with another cell (there are four
connections between all cells, as in G) and this results in a decreased amplitude
of the calcium wave propagation from the ﬁrst cell. There is an even stronger
decrease of the amplitude of wave propagation in the case of conﬁguration F
(Fig. 3f), which is a linear chain of four cells. Therefore we conclude that the
topology of connections between cell can play an important role in calcium wave
propagation in cells.

6 Analysis of bursting behavior in our model

There is an important qualitative diﬀerence between the model of Marhl et al.
(2000) and ours (for a single cell), in that their model displays a limit cycle
behavior for the calcium bursting oscillations whereas our does not.
In real
cellular systems the amplitude of cytosolic calcium oscillations decreases during
the action of the agonist (Arnaudeau et al., 2001), (Kaftan et al., 2000). Fig.
14 shows the phase trajectory of our system in the case of a small level of IP3
(IP3 = 2µM ), while Fig. 15 shows the trajectory in the case of a high level
of IP3 (IP3 = 40µM ).
In the case of a small level of IP3 (less than about
2.14µM ) we obtain a limit cycle behavior, but if one increases the magnitude
of IP3, the amplitude of cytosolic calcium oscillations decreases until a steady
state behavior occurs. We believe that this is the result of the calcium ﬂuxes
through the plasma membrane of cell that we include in the model. The reason
for the limit cycle behavior in the case of a small level of IP3 might be due to
a balance between the ﬂuxes Jin and Jout in our model, since these depend on
the concentrations of Cacyt and IP3 in the cytosol.

7 Conclusion

In this study, we demonstrated the importance of the mitochondria in both in-
tracellular and intercellular calcium oscillations. Our model gives results that
are in good agreement with several experimental studies (Kaftan et al., 2000),
(Hajnoczky and Thomas, 1997), (Arnaudeau et al., 2001), as noted in section 4.
Our model shows the main features of intracellular calcium signaling, including
the fact that during cytosolic calcium oscillations the concentration of calcium
in the ER decreases while the concentration of mitochondrial calcium increases
(Arnaudeau et al., 2001). The mitochondrion accumulates calcium rapidly and
in phase with the oscillatory elevations of cytosolic calcium. Furthermore, the
mitochondrial calcium concentration remains elevated for many minutes after
the end of the action of IP3 and of the calcium oscillations in cytosol, as seen

10

experimentally (Kaftan et al., 2000). It is also worth noting that the collapse
of the mitochondrial calcium uptake in our model signiﬁcantly reduces the fre-
quency of cytosolic calcium oscillations as compared with its behavior for the
normal case; this is only in partial agreement with the experimental results
(Kaftan et al., 2000).

We also studied the inﬂuence of the spatial organization of interactions be-
tween cells on intercellular calcium signaling. Since both calcium and IP3 can
act as intercellular messengers (Evans and Sanderson, 1999), it remains unclear
whether Ca2+ or IP3 is the messenger communicated through gap junctions to
initiate intercellular calcium waves. Therefore we considered all three possibil-
ities: diﬀusion of only Ca2+, only IP3 and both Ca2+ and IP3 through gap
junctions. In the case in which only Ca2+ is the messenger, there is no any
intercellular calcium wave at all. In the case in which only IP3 is the messen-
ger, there is a propagation of calcium waves, but the oscillations of cytosolic
calcium in cells adjacent to the stimulated cell are not in synchrony with the
oscillations in the perturbed cell. Finally, when both calcium and IP3 diﬀuse
there is calcium wave propagation with completely synchronous oscillations in
each cell. Therefore we conclude, at least within the context of the model, that
diﬀusion of calcium through gap junctions is responsible for the synchronization
of calcium oscillations in adjacent cells, but is not the reason for calcium wave
propagation in cell cultures. Correspondingly, the diﬀusion of IP3 is the mech-
anism for intercellular calcium wave propagation. These results might be due
to our taking into account the dependence of the gap junctional conductivity
on the cytosolic calcium concentrations in adjacent cells.

We also studied the dependence of intercellular signalling on the topological
conﬁgurations of cell connectivity, and found results that can be understood
intuitively.
If a conﬁguration is symmetrical from the ﬁrst (stimulated) cell,
then the wave propagation also has a symmetry. The number of connections
(”coordination number”) also inﬂuences the amplitude of wave propagation, as
discussed in section 5. Finally, in our study of the role of network connectivity
between cells we considered only the case in which the cells have the same
parameters.
It would be interesting to study situations in which there is a
variation in cellular sensitivity to IP3 (Evans and Sanderson, 1999) and in gap
junction conductivities. These are the subject of future research.

In this work it is shown that vascular structures of the human retina represent geometrical multi-
fractals, characterized by a hierarchy of exponents rather then a single fractal dimension. A number
of retinal images from the STARE database (www.parl.clemson.edu/stare) are analyzed, correspond-
ing to both normal and pathological states of the retina. In all studied cases a clearly multifractal
behavior is observed, where capacity dimension is always found to be smaller then the information
dimension, which is in turn always smaller then the correlation dimension, all the three being sig-
niﬁcantly lower then the DLA (Diﬀusion Limited Aggregation) fractal dimension. We also observe
a tendency of images corresponding to the normal state of the retina to have higher generalized
dimensions and a wider spectrum range, in comparison with the pathological cases.

Over the past decade, there have been several attempts
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] in the direction of employing the frac-
tal dimension as a measure for quantifying the “state” of
human retinal vessel structures (considered as geometri-
cal objects), with the expectation that such analysis may
contribute to automatic detection of pathological cases,
and therefore to computerization of the diagnostic pro-
cess. While this is certainly a valid question with pos-
sibly high impact on real world diagnostic issues, there
are some issues that should be addressed before such in-
vestigations may prove useful for the standard diagnostic
practice. First, the fact that retinal vessels represent “ﬁ-
nite size” realizations of a fractal growth process, imposes
questions about how exactly should one go about mea-
suring the fractal dimension of a particular instance (e.g.
an electronic image of a retinal vessel structure, taken
from a given angle, with a given resolution and light-
ning conditions). A related question is to what extent
these calculations may correspond to the limiting fractal
(which would have been attained if the growth process
could have been extended to inﬁnity), or equivalently, to
what degree they may be compared with calculations on
other such ﬁnite instances. Although various issues re-
lated to these questions have already been addressed (for
a current review see e.g. [6]), it seems that many of them
remain open for further investigation. Second, some of
these works [3, 4] address the point that the retinal ves-
sels may have diﬀerent properties in diﬀerent regions,
and do indeed ﬁnd diﬀerent characteristics depending
on the locale of measurement, although the procedures
adopted in these works are only remotely related to cur-
rent concepts of multifractality, and the corresponding

commonly accepted procedures for its measurement (see
e.g. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and references therein).

In this work we concentrate on the latter of the above
issues, that is, we show that the human retinal vessel
structures are geometrical multifractals, characterized by
a hierarchy of exponents rather then a single fractal di-
mension. We analyze a number of retinal images from
the STARE database [13], corresponding to both nor-
mal and pathological states of the retina.
In all cases
we ﬁnd clearly multifractal behavior. The capacity (or
box counting) dimension is always found to be smaller
then the information (or Shannon) dimension, which is in
turn always smaller then the correlation dimension. In all
cases the observed values of the capacity dimension were
signiﬁcantly lower then the DLA (Diﬀusion Limited Ag-
gregation) fractal dimension, which has been considered
in earlier works [1, 2, 6] as the primary model relevant
for the phenomenon at hand. It is also found that nor-
mal images tend to have higher generalized dimensions,
as well as a somewhat wider spectrum range, than the
pathological cases.

In contrast to regular fractals (or monofractals), mul-
tifractals are characterized by a hierarchy of exponents,
rather then a single fractal dimension. A well known ex-
ample of multifractality is the growth probability distri-
bution during the DLA growth process, which has been
shown to exhibit multifractal scaling [14, 15, 16, 17].
Geometrical (or mass) multifractals represent a special
case when the measure of interest is homogeneously dis-
tributed over the observed structure, so that only the
number of particles (Lebesgue measure) contributes to
the measure within a given region of the fractal [8, 9].
Considering a structure with mass (number of pixels)
M0 and linear size L, covered with a grid of boxes of
linear size ℓ, the generalized dimension Dq for the mass

distribution is deﬁned by

where Mi is the mass (number of pixels) within the i-
th box, and q is a continuous (adjustable) variable that
makes it possible to single out fractal properties of the ob-
ject at diﬀerent scales (equivalent of inverse temperature
in thermodynamics). The generalized dimensions D0, D1
and D2 correspond to the capacity (or box-counting) di-
mension, information (or Shannon) dimension, and cor-
relation dimension, respectively. Finally, D−∞ and D∞
represent the limits of the generalized dimension spec-
trum (for monofractals, all the generalized dimensions
coincide, being equal to the unique fractal dimension).

It turns out that the direct application of (1) in prac-
tice is hindered by the fact that for q < 0 the boxes
that contain a small number of particles (because they
barely overlap with the cluster) give anomalously large
contribution to the sum on the left hand side of (1). To
alleviate this problem and perform the multifractal anal-
ysis of the retinal vessel structures, we adopt the gen-
eralized sand box method [9, 10], which has been suc-
cessfully used do demonstrate geometric multifractality
of DLA [9]. This procedure consists in randomly select-
ing N points belonging to the structure, and counting for
each such point i the number of pixels Mi that belong to
the structure, inside boxes of growing linear dimension
R, centered at the selected pixels. The left hand side of
equation (1) can now be interpreted as the average of the
quantity (Mi/M0)q−1 according to probability distribu-
tion Mi/M0. When the box centers are chosen randomly,
the averaging should be made over the chosen set, and
the equivalent of (1) becomes

The practical advantage of this method is that the boxes
are centered on the structure, so that there are no boxes
with too few particles (pixels) inside.

To verify whether human retinal vessel structures
demonstrate geometrical multifractal scaling properties,
we have used twenty retinal images from the STARE
database [13], manually extracted from the original pho-
tographs for the purpose of studies on automatic image
segmentation [18]. The segmented images are available
for download from the STARE project [13] in ppm ﬁle
format, with resolution of 700x605 pixels. The set of im-
ages used contains both normal and pathological cases
(classiﬁed as “Familiar”, “Unfamiliar” or “Partially fa-
miliar” [19]), a typical normal and a pathological image
are shown in Fig. 1.

For all of the twenty images we have performed mea-
surements (calculations) according to (2), selecting 1000
random points on each structure (typical structure size
M0 is approximately 30000 pixels, and the typical linear

size L is 600 pixels), and counting number Mi of pixels
inside boxes centered at selected points. These numbers
were then used to extract generalized dimension Dq, for
diﬀerent values of q (−10 < q < 10), as slopes of the lines
obtained through regression (minimum squares ﬁtting) of
/(q − 1), versus log(R/L).

The whole procedure was repeated 100 times (with dif-
E
ferent random choices of the 1000 random points), for
each image, and for each value of q. The ﬁnal values of
Dq were calculated as averages over these repetitions.

[M (R)/M0]q−1

D

A word is due on calculations for the special case
q = 1, corresponding to information dimension D1. As
the above formulas are non-analytic for q = 1, we per-
form calculations at q = 1±ǫ, for ǫ = 0.001, and assuming
linearity of the function D(q) in this (short) interval, we
interpolate D1 ≈ (D1−ǫ + D1+ǫ) /2 (in fact, the diﬀer-
ence between the values of Dq calculated on both sides
of q = 1 was found to be only slightly larger then the
statistical ﬂuctuations induced by random choice of the
set of measurement points on the structure).

Results of a typical calculation are shown in Fig. 2,
where it is seen that the observed retinal vessel structure
clearly demonstrates multifractal scaling, rather then be-
ing a simple monofractal (there is a signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence between generalized dimensions). In particular, the
capacity dimension D0, the information dimension D1
and the correlation dimension D2 are all diﬀerent, sat-
isfying D0 > D1 > D2. Also, all the three values re-
main substantially lower then the DLA fractal dimen-
sion Dq=2 ≃ 1.71 (which is in fact underestimated by
commonly used methods) [9], in contrast with previous
ﬁndings [1, 2, 6].

Numerical results of the calculations on all the twenty
studied images from the STARE database are given in

mal” [19]. The values of generalized dimensions Dq are
given for q = −10, 0, 1, 2, 10, where as already mentioned
D0, D1 and D2 correspond to the capacity, information
and correlation dimension, respectively, while D−10 and
D10 indicate the range of the general dimension spec-
trum. It is seen from Tab. I that all of the values cal-
culated for the capacity dimension (which corresponds
to box counting method), and indeed the correlation di-
mension (corresponding to methods such as radius of gy-
ration or the density-density correlation function), are
signiﬁcantly lower then the DLA dimension Dq=2 ≃ 1.71
[9].

When addressing multifractality, numerous works deal

with the so-called f (α) spectrum [7, 8, 20], where

represents the number of boxes N (α) where the proba-
bility Pi of ﬁnding a particle (pixel) within a given region
i scales as

N (α) = L

−f (α),

Pi = Lαi ,

and f (α) may be understood as the fractal dimension
of the union of regions with singularity strenghts be-
tween α and α + dα. The exponent α takes values
from the interval [−∞, ∞], and the function f (α) is
usually a single humped function with a maximum at
df (α(q))/dα(q) = 0. The relationship between the D(q)
spectrum and the f (α) spectrum is made via the Legen-

is the mass correlation exponent of the qth order. To
calculate the derivatives in (6), we have performed cal-

so that derivatives were calculated as dτ (q)/dq ≈ (τ (q +

dτ (q)/dq ≈ (τ (1 + ǫ) − τ (1 − ǫ))/(2ǫ).

In Fig. 3 we show the results of our calculations per-
formed on the STARE database images with respect to
the f (α) spectrum. While the current set of images is
not adequate for testing the eﬀects of a given type of
pathology (there are ten normal images, and ten patho-
logical images with diagnosis status classiﬁed as “Famil-
iar”, “Partially Familiar” and “Unfamiliar” [19]), it is
seen that normal images tend to have higher dimensions,
a wider spectrum range, and somewhat higher maxima,
than the pathological cases. These ﬁndings are encour-
aging from the point of view of the objective of turning
the diagnostic process automatic, although further more
detailed studies are necessary to determine their statis-
tical signiﬁcance, and whether the observed diﬀerences

in multifractal scaling behavior may be exploited for dis-
cerning normal images from images with certain types of
pathologies. More precisely, the current work is primar-
ily concerned with establishing the fact that retinal vessel
images represent geometrical multifractals, nevertheless,
our calculations suggest that there may be grounds for
automatic diﬀerentiating between normal images and cer-
tain pathological cases.

In conclusion, we show in this work that vascular struc-
tures of the human retina represent geometrical multi-
fractals, characterized by a hierarchy of exponents, rather
then a single fractal dimension. We analyze twenty reti-
nal images from the STARE database [13], where half of
the images correspond to normal states of the retina, and
half to diﬀerent pathological states [19]. In all studied
cases we ﬁnd clearly multifractal behavior, with capac-
ity dimension considerably lower then the DLA value.
We also observe a tendency of normal images of hav-
ing higher generalized dimensions and a wider spectrum
range, in comparison with the pathological cases. While
the last observations are hardly conclusive from a statis-
tical standpoint, they may prove relevant in the quest of
automatic diagnostic procedures.

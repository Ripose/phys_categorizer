We present a detailed study of transport and energetic of a Brow-

nian particle moving in period potential in the present of correlated noises.

The current and the eﬃciency of the system are investigated. It is found

that, when the potential is spatial symmetry, the correlation between noises

can induce transport and the current reversal occurs at the case of uncorre-

lation. The eﬃciency shows many interesting features as a function of the

applied force, noise intensity, the external load, etc. The eﬃciency can be

maximized as a function of noise intensity (or temperature) which shows

that the thermal ﬂuctuation can facilitate the eﬃciency of the energy trans-

formation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Much of the interest in non-equilibrium-induced transport processes is concentrated

on stochastically driven ratchets [1] [2] [3]. This subject was motivated by the challenge

to explain unidirectional transport in biological systems, and several models have been

proposed to describe muscle contraction [4] [5] [6], or the asymmetric polymerization of

action ﬁlaments responsible of cell motility [7].

Rectiﬁcation of noise leading to unidirectional motion in ratchet systems has been an

active ﬁeld of research over the last decade. In these systems directed Brownian motion of

particles is induced by nonequilibrium noise in the absence of any net macroscopic forces

and potential gradients. Several physical models have been proposed: rocking ratchets

[8], fashing ratchets [9], diﬀusion ratchets [10] ,correlation ratchets [11], etc. In all these

1

studies the potential is taken to be asymmetric in space. It has also been shown that one

can obtain unidirectional current in the presence of spatially asymmetric potentials. For

these nonequilibrium systems external random force should be time asymmetric or the

presence of space dependent mobility is required.

Molecular motors are known to have the high eﬃciency of energy transformation in

the presence of thermal ﬂuctuation [1]. Motivated by the surprising fact, recently the

eﬃciency with which the ratchet converts ﬂuctuation to useful work is a much interest

subject. New questions regarding the nature of heat engines at molecular scales are being

investigated [12].

In this paper, we mainly explore the current and eﬃciency of the forced thermal

ratchet in a periodic potential in the presence of an adiabatic external period driven. The

organization of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II we introduce the model and the basic

quantities, namely, the average particle current and the eﬃciency of the ratchet. In Sec.

III we discuss the probability of obtaining a current with the symmetric potential for the

case of L = 0. Section IV is devoted to the exploration of the eﬃciency of the system.

The summary and discussion of our ﬁndings is presented in Sec. V.

II. THE FORCED THERMAL RATCHET WITH CORRELATED NOISE

We consider a forced ratchet system subject to an external Load:

dx
dt

= −

∂V0(x)
∂x

+ a0F (t) + ξ2(t)F (t) + ξ1(t) −

(1)

∂VL(x)
∂x

,

where x represents the state of the ratchet, F (t) is an external ﬂuctuation, F (t+τ ) = F (t),

τ
0 F (t) = 0 and F0 is amplitude of F (t). V0(x + 2nπ) = V0(x) = − sin(x), n being any
R
natural integer and VL(x) is a potential due to the load, ∂VL(x)

∂x = L > 0. ξ1(t), ξ2(t)
are thermal white noises with zero mean. There are two thermal noise in the system

(1), and they are usually treated as independent random variables in most of previous

investigations. However, here we assume that the two thermal noise are correlated with

each other and the correlations between noises have following form [13] [14]

< ξi(t)ξj(t

) >= 2Ci,j

where Ci,j = λ for i 6= j and Ci,j = 1 for i = j, λ denotes the cross-correlation degree

between ξ1(t) and ξ2(t), and −1 ≤ λ ≤ 1. The ratchet system transforms the external

ﬂuctuation into work. The model Magnasco discussed is a special case of the present

system, where the external load is omitted [7].

When F (t) changes slowly enough, the system could be treated as quasi-static, the

evolution of probability density P (x, t) described by Eq. (1) is then given by the Fokker-

Planck equation

∂P (x, t)

where the probability current density j(x, t) is given by

In the stationary situation, the expression of the stationary current j is given with the

same procedure as in Ref. 14.

Thus the eﬃciency η of the system to transform the external ﬂuctuation to useful work

is given by

III. CURRENT IN THE SYSTEM FOR THE CASE L = 0

From Eq. (7) it may be noted that even for L = 0, j(F0) may not be equal to −j(−F0)

for λ 6= 0, so the average current < j >6= 0. This fact leads to the rectiﬁcation of current

in the presence of an applied ﬁeld F (t). The numerical results are given by Fig. 1-Fig. 4.

Fig.1-Fig. 4

In Fig.1 We have plotted the current is a function of the intensity λ of correlations

between noises, We found that the critical value λc = 0 for current < j >= 0, the current

is positive for λ > 0 and negative for λ < 0. The current increase with λ. We can

see that the current reversal can occur at the case of uncorrelation between noise and the

system can exhibits a current in either direction. The correlation intensity in a symmetric

potential case play a important role in the ﬂuctuation-induced transport.

In Fig.2, We have plotted the current versus the amplitude of the adiabatic forcing

F0. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that current < j > exhibits maximum and saturates

to the zero value in the large amplitude limit.

Fig.3 shows that the current is a peaked function of D2 and and the current goes to

zero for a large noise case. Similarly, the current is a peaked function of D1 as shown in

Fig.4. The results shows that an optimal transport occurs at some noise cases and there

is no net current for a large noise case.

4

In our system, the potential of the ratchet is completely symmetric in space and the

external driving force F (t) is completely symmetric in time. No current occur when there

is no correlations (λ = 0) between thermal noises ξ1(t) and ξ2(t). When λ 6= 0, the eﬀective

spatially potential of the system is not the same as the symmetric potential V (x), since

the two eﬀects of external driving force in its period can not be cancelled because of λ 6= 0,

so the symmetry of the generalized potential is broken by the correlation between noises

when λ 6= 0. It is known that the state-dependent diﬀusion can induce transport in case of

the symmetry of generalized potential being broken. Therefore, neither spatial asymmetry

nor temporal asymmetry is required, the correlations between noises can induce transport.

IV. EFFICIENCY IN CORRELATED RATCHET

In this section we discuss the eﬃciency and the corresponding current of the ratchet

at an external load base on Eq. (11)-Eq. (13). Because j(−F0)

j(F0) < 0, Eq. (13) can be

rewritten as follow

η =

{1 −

L
F0

2| j(−F0)
j(F0) |
1 + | j(−F0)
j(F0) |

}.

(14)

In the limit | j(−F0)
load L and force amplitude F0 is given: ηmax = L

j(F0) | → 0, the maximum eﬃciency of the energy transformation for given
F0 . The results are represented by Fig.

5-Fig.8.

Fig.5-Fig. 8

In Fig. 5 we have plotted the eﬃciency η, input energy < R > and work done < W >

(scaled up by a factor 30 for convenience of comparison) as a function of D2 for the

parameter values, F0 = 0, D1 = 0.5, λ = 0.5 and the load L = 0.04. The ﬁgure shows that

the eﬃciency exhibits a maximum as function of D2 indicating that thermal ﬂuctuation

facilitates energy conversion. The input energy < R > increase with D2 monotonically

and saturates at a large noise intensity limit. The work done < W > exhibits a maximum

as a function of D2.

Fig. 6 shows the eﬃciency η as function of D1 for diﬀerent value of λ. The eﬃciency

is a peaked function of D1 and the eﬃciency increase with the parameter λ. Similarly, the

5

current is a peaked function of D1 for corresponding parameters as shown in the inset.

We can notice from the inset that the current reverses its direction as function of noise

strength for the case λ 6= 0. It is to be noted that noise intensity D1 corresponding to

maximum eﬃciency is not the same as the noise intensity at which the current < j >

(see the inset of Fig. 6) is maximum. The diﬀerence is attributed to the observation that

the eﬃciency is ratio of the extracted < W > to the consumed energy < R >. The work

< W > is purely proportional to the current < j >. However, the consumed energy is

not a constant but varies sensitively according to the condition. Therefore the eﬃciency

η is not simply proportional to the current < j >.

In Fig. 7, we have plotted η (the inset for current < j >) versus load L for diﬀerent

values of λ. It is expected that the eﬃciency too exhibits maximum as a function of load.

It is obvious that the eﬃciency is zero when load is zero. At the critical value Lc (beyond

which current ﬂows in the direction of the load (see the inset of Fig.7)) the value of current

is zero and hence the eﬃciency vanishes again. In the between these two extreme values

of the load the eﬃciency exhibits maximum. Beyond L = Lc the current ﬂows down the

load, and therefore, the idea of eﬃciency becomes invalid.

The eﬃciency η versus the amplitude of the adiabatic forcing F0 for diﬀerent values of

λ is shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that η exhibits maximum and satu-

rates to the same value (zero) in large amplitude limit. Beyond the large amplitude limit

the eﬃciency increase with the parameter values of λ which indicates that the correlation

between noises play a important role for energy transformation.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In present paper, we study the current and the eﬃciency of the forced thermal ratchet

with correlated noises. For the case of L = 0, no net current occur when there is no

correlations (λ = 0) between the thermal noises, while the net current occur at the

case of λ 6= 0. It is obvious that the symmetry of generalized potential is broken by the

correlation between noises. Therefore, neither spatial asymmetry nor temporal asymmetry

is required, the correlation can induce transport. The current is the peaked function of

D2, D1 and F0 and it goes to zero at the case of large D2, D1 and F0 limit.

6

For the case of L 6= 0, The eﬃciency of the ratchet is investigated. The eﬃciency

shows a maximum as a function of noise intensity as does the net current < j >, though

they do not occur at the same noise intensity. It is obvious that the thermal ﬂuctuation

is not harmful for ﬂuctuation-induced work even facilitates its eﬃciency which is opposite

to Ref. 15. The current reversal occurs at λ 6= 0 which is diﬀerent from the case of L = 0.

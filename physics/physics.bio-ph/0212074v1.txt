Abstract

Solvation free energy is an important quantity in Computational Chemistry with a
variety of applications, especially in drug discovery and design. The accurate predic-
tion of solvation free energies of small molecules in water is still a largely unsolved
problem, which is mainly due to the complex nature of the water-solute interac-
tions. In this letter we develop a scheme for the determination of the electrostatic
contribution to the solvation free energy of charged molecules based on nonlocal
electrostatics involving a minimal parameter set which in particular allows to in-
troduce atomic radii in a consistent way. We test our approach on simple ions and
small molecules for which both experimental results and other theoretical descrip-
tions are available for quantitative comparison. We conclude that our approach is
both physically transparent and quantitatively reliable.

Key words: solvation free energy, nonlocal electrostatics

1 Introduction

The unique properties of water, namely its polar nature, high dielectric con-
stant, and its ability to form hydrogen bonds (1), are responsible for the
existence of life as we know it. At the same time, these very properties are
the main obstacle in modelling hydration eﬀects. An accurate model of ion
and small molecule hydration will therefore have important applications in
computational chemistry, chemical engineering, and drug design.

In the latter, the interest stems from the fact that drug-like small molecules
are usually moderately polar to achieve the required bioavailability. Therefore
their solvation free energy is generally dominated by the electrostatic contri-
bution, while the nonpolar contribution is more or less negligible. One of the
most successful models for predicting solvation free energies of small molecules
(and proteins) therefore employs the Poisson or Poisson-Boltzmann equations
(2; 3). Within this approach, the solvent is typically treated as a structureless
medium of a given dielectric constant ε (for water, ε ∼ 80.) The solute itself
is treated as a low-ε “cavity” (4).

Clearly, this approach fails to take into account many relevant details of
the solvent structure. The presence of long-ranged electrostatic ﬁelds induces
static correlations among the polar molecules that may vary considerably in
space depending on the molecular build-up of the solute. These can be taken
into account by performing Molecular Dynamics simulations, thus leaving the
continuum description at the expense of high computational cost even for
small molecules (5).

Including more structural detail into the continuum description on the one
hand without increasing computational complexity on the other is therefore
highly desirable. At the same time, however, also the avoidance of additional
parameter sets, which is common practice in the use of continuum electrostat-
ics in computational chemistry, is a key requirement.

In this work, we follow one particular route to achieve this goal. We develop an
approach for the computation of the electrostatic (polar) contribution to the
free energy of solvation based on nonlocal electrostatics (7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12).
This continuum approach, originating in the physics literature as a general-
ization of classical electrostatics to account for media with spatial dispersion,
is developed here within a physically transparent minimal parameter set and
applied to the simplest systems of single ions and small molecules for which ex-
perimental and theoretical results are available for quantitative comparison.
In particular we address the issue of a systematic choice of ion radii which
most commonly is based on essentially empirical parametrizations (13). We
conclude with an outlook on extensions of our approach for more complex,
and biologically relevant, molecules.

2 Nonlocal electrostatics of the solvent

The electrostatic potential φ of a charged molecule in solution is, within clas-
sical (local) electrostatics, given by the Poisson equation (6)

∇ [ε(r)ε0∇φ(r)] = −̺(r)

(1)

2

where ε0 denotes the dielectric constant of vacuum, and ε(r) is a local dielectric
function which is taken as the constants εwater ≈ 78 of the solution (water),
and a much smaller value within a solute molecule (for proteins, e.g., a typical
value taken is ε ≈ 2 − 5). The rhs of eq.(1) is the charge density giving rise to
the potential.

This arguably simple description is prone to complications: ﬁrst, the transition
region between solute and solution is ill-described and needs a further (rather
delicate) modeling. Second, very little is said about structural eﬀects due to
the orientation of the polar water molecules near highly charged regions of a
given solute molecule.

The simplest way to introduce structural eﬀects into a continuum description
of the solvent is to account for correlations due to polarization eﬀects between
solution molecules characterized by a correlation length λ. This gives rise to
a nonlocal generalization of eq.(1) given by (7)

∇r

dV ′ε(|r − r′|)ε0∇r′φ(r′) = −̺(r)

Z

(2)

where isotropy of the liquid medium is supposed.

The rationale behind eq.(2) is the following. Since the electrostatic ﬁelds are
long-ranged, the solvent molecules will feel the presence of the ﬁelds of other
molecules over characteristic distances (that will be of particular relevance
below). Maintaining locality of the physical ﬁelds (i.e., electrostatic potentials
and electric ﬁelds), it is the response functions into which this purely static
correlation eﬀect needs to be embedded. We note that the dielectric function
is related to the dielectric response function via ε = 1 + χ, irrespective of the
local or nonlocal character of the theoretical description.

Due to the assumption of spatial isotropy, eq.(2) lends itself to a treatment
in Fourier space, reducing the linear integro-diﬀerential equation eq.(2) to
an algebraic equation involving the Fourier-transformed function ε(|k|) with
wavevector k. Explicit functional dependences of either ε(|r − r′|) or ε(|k|)
have been derived from various approaches, e.g. within a Ginzburg-Landau
theory for the polarization ﬁelds (10).

Motivated by these works we have formulated a family of nonlocal dielectric
functions fulﬁlling the following minimal requirements (14) :

i) for high k-values (equivalently, on small spatial scales) the solvent molecules
cannot follow the polarization forces.

Thus, a limiting value for the macroscopic dielectric function has to be reached
in this limit. Typical choices in the literature are limk→∞ ε(k) ∼ ε∞ ≈ 1.8

3

(10; 15), or ε∞ = 1 (16). We have considered both cases and do not ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant dependence on this choice;

ii) in the opposite limit, k → 0, the value for ε should equal the macroscopic
value;

iii) the physical length scale of the polarization ﬂuctuations is characterized
by a correlation length λ. The local electrostatic limit is given by limλ→0ε(|r−
r′|) = εlocδ(r − r′);

iv) causality conditions (Kramers-Kronig relations) need to be fulﬁlled (16).

While the conditions i)-iv) are clearly not suﬃcient to determine the dielectric
function unambiguously, we ﬁnd that the following class of functions in Fourier
space fulﬁll these criteria suﬃciently well (17)

ε(k) =

1
(2π)3/2 "

,

which depend on only two parameters, n, and λ. For n = 2, the dielectric
function decays exponentially in real-space, while ε(k) is a Lorentzian for
n = 1, decaying in real-space as exp(−r/λ)/r. Note that formally the case
n = 1 was discussed previously in (8; 9), based, however, on a diﬀerent physical
interpretation (see also (18) for a similar approach in the context of nuclear
physics). We have also tested alternative choices, e.g. a Gaussian model and a
nonlocal model derived from a Ginzburg-Landau theory for polarization ﬁelds
(10).

The comparison of our nonlocal models with other approaches and experimen-
tal data is made possible by using the concept of an eﬀective local dielectric
function

ε(r). It is usually deﬁned for the potential of a point charge q,

ε(r) can be deﬁned as well (22). We note that
For a general charge distribution
our determination of the eﬀective dielectric constant is consistently performed
within the nonlocal continuum theory and does not rely on data-based ﬁts
(19; 20).

Expression (5) allows to test our approach against previous results. We took
empirical models for the radial dependence of ε derived for experimental re-
sults from Mehler and Eichele (ME) (19) and Conway (CO) (21). The CO-
model is reproduced best by the Lorentzian (n = 1) for λ = 15˚A, while the
ME-model is reproduced best for λ = 24.13˚A. The purely exponential model
ε(r) at small r, while with a choice
(n = 2) displays unphysical singularities in
of λ = 5˚A, the CO-model is reproduced for larger distances, r > 15˚A. Figure 1

model with λ = 15˚A. The computation of
ε(r) performed here makes use of a
speciﬁcally adapted FFT applicable also to molecules (22).

A Gaussian choice for ε(k), however, leads to strong oscillations in the eﬀective
dielectric function, although its overall shape resembles the CO-model for
λ = 5˚A. Checking our approach against the nonlocal model by Sutmann et al.
(10), we ﬁnd that their theory fails to comply with our requirement iii), i.e.,
it does not reproduce the correct limiting value at large distances.

3 Single ions and the choice of their radii

We now turn to the application of our approach to small ions. We treat these
ions as Born spheres. A standard problem in the deﬁnition of Born-type ions is
the deﬁnition of the ion radius (13). Starting from the accepted interpretation
that a solvated ion is surrounded by solvation shells, the ﬁrst of these shells
will be “as close as possible” to the ion. We can therefore identify the position
of the centers of the oxygen in the ﬁrst solvation shell with the ﬁrst peak in the
radial distribution function (rdf) which can be obtained either from scattering
experiments or from molecular dynamics simulations.

We deﬁned the radius of the water oxygen as half the position of the ﬁrst peak
in the oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function (rdf) of bulk water. The ion
radii were then derived by subtracting this radius from the position of the ﬁrst
peak of the ion-oxygen rdf derived from a molecular dynamics simulation.

As a speciﬁc input for our calculations we take the values for the ion radii
determined by ˚Aqvist (23), obtained from a combined free energy perturba-
tion/force ﬁeld approach based on the GROMOS force ﬁeld (24), employing
several diﬀerent water models (ﬂexible SPC, rigid SPC, and TIP3P). Based
on this input, we have determined the solvation free energy from nonlocal

where D(k) is the dielectric ﬂux density.

The result of the calculation is shown in Figs. 2 for monovalent ions and in
Fig. 3 for divalent ions, for all models to be compared here. Note that we
chose the parameter λ based on its ﬁt to the eﬀective dielectric function. The
CO-model was reproduced by λ = 5˚A for n = 2 (exponential model), by
λ = 15˚A for n = 1 (Lorentzian) and by λ = 5˚A for the Gaussian model. The
ME-model could only be reproduced by n = 1 with λ = 24.13˚A. The value for
the exponential model is in accord with the ﬁndings in Ref. (11). Also note,
as shown in Table 1, that the values we obtain are only marginally corrected
(if at all) by eﬀects due to nonlinear saturation, which contributes in principle
as well to a reduction of the dielectric constant near the ion.

The model by Sutmann was used with two diﬀerent limiting values (Sutmann
1 with ε∞ = 1, and Sutmann 2 with ε∞ = 1.8). As the ﬁgures show, our
results are consistently better than all the other theoretical curves.

The computation of electrostatic solvation free energies is also possible by
employing eq.(5) in a standard (local) Poisson solver. We have implemented
this in an available library (BALL) (25; 22). Fig. 4 compares the results of
our computations for the monovalent ions with the nonlocal theory based on
eq.(6) and from the eﬀective local dielectric function, eq.(5), demonstrating
the consistency of both approaches. Fig. 5 ﬁnally compares the theoretical
results of the local and nonlocal approaches, obtained with the Poisson solver,
with the experiment values. Evidently, the nonlocal approach yields results
consistently superior to those obtained from the standard local theory.

We stress the signiﬁcant advantage of our computations to work with ﬁrst-
principle radii without arbitrary adjustments. In Figs. 2-5, the ˚Aqvist-radii
were used (23). In addition, we have also tested the Shannon-radii derived
from X-ray crystal data (27; 28), without signiﬁcant eﬀect on our results.
Our result thus give a basis to the general belief that the need to introduce
eﬀective radii is in fact a consequence of the local water structure around
the ions (26). We believe that our nonlocal approach demonstrates that it is
therefore preferable conceptually to introduce the length-scale governing the
structural eﬀects in the solvent rather than introducing necessarily artiﬁcial
procedures to adjust the Born radii.

4 Small molecules

As a second application we apply our approach to determine the solvation
free energy for small alcohols for which we can assume that the polar con-
tribution exceeds the nonpolar one. Fortunately, accurate measurements of
the solvation free energies of these molecules are available. We write the
charge distribution of these molecules as a linear superposition of radially
symmetric partial distributions translated by a vector R, ̺i = ̺(|r + Ri|), i.e.
N
i=1 ̺i(|r + Ri|). Its Fourier transform is then given by the expression
̺(r) =
N
i=1 ̺i(k) exp(−iRi · k).
̺(k) =

P
P

Again we have to deﬁne the radii of the atoms. For this we chose to classify the
atoms into classes depending on their chemical environment in the molecule
(e.g., like the hydrogen atom in an OH-group), expecting that the radii of all
atoms in a certain class are more or less similar. For methanol (CH3OH), e.g.,
we deﬁned four classes of atoms and used their rdf’s with the oxygen of water
to ﬁnd the following set of radii: Methyl C: 2.135 ˚A, hydroxyl O: 2.014 ˚A,
hydroxyl H: 1.115 ˚A, methyl H: 1.394 ˚A.

Compared to the calculation of the free energies for the ions this computation
is slightly more involved as it requires a three-dimensional integration instead
of a one-dimensional one. To ensure short computation times, in our imple-
mentation we have used the VEGAS-Monte-Carlo integration scheme (29)
that is supplied with the GNU scientiﬁc library GSL (30). Details of these
computations will again be given elsewhere (22).

The results for some small alcohols are shown in Table 1. For the comparison
we have used the exponential with λ = 5 ˚A, the Lorentzian with λ = 15 ˚A,
and the Lorentzian with λ = 24.13 ˚A. All values in these tables are given in
kJ/mol.

The interpretation of the results is more complicated than in the Born ion
case. While there we could assume that the contribution of the nonpolar part
of the free energy of solvation could be neglected (for the Born ions it can be
estimated to be of the order of 10 − 20 kJ/mol), this is not the case for the
alcohols. The electrostatic contribution is still the dominant part, but not the
only signiﬁcant one. We therefore applied a very simple model for the nonpolar
contribution (31) in order to be able to compare our results to experimental
data. The results given for the polar contribution can also be optimized by
considering improved charge distributions (22).

5 Conclusions and outlook

We have demonstrated that the approach to the computation of solvation free
energies based on nonlocal electrostatics is able to reproduce experimental
data for ions and small molecules with reasonable accuracy. The approach we
put forward has the basic advantage to rely on essentially one parameter which
has a transparent physical interpretation as the correlation length of the po-
larization ﬂuctuations. While within the present paper this parameter is used
as a ﬁtting parameter, it should be clear that it might be also determined by
experiment or simulation. A further signiﬁcant advantage is that our approach
does not make use of the commonly used adjustments of atomic or ionic radii.
A challenge for the future will be the extension of our approach to determine
electrostatic solvation free energies for more complex and biologically relevant
molecules. Work in this direction is in progress (22).

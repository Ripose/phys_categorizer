Chirality Selection Models in a Closed System

Yukio Saito and Hiroyuki Hyuga
Department of Physics, Keio University, Yokohama 223-8522, Japan

Recently the ﬁrst chemical systems which show the ampliﬁcation of enantiomeric excess (ee) was
found. Inspired by these experiments, we propose a few chemical reaction models in a closed sys-
tem. The reactions consist of autocatalytic production of chiral molecules and their decomposition
processes. By means of ﬂow diagrams in the phase space of enatiometric concentrations, chiral
symmetry breaking is studied.

Without any destruction processes, the quadratic autocatalysis leads to the ampliﬁcation of ee,
but the ﬂow is attracted to a ﬁxed line, which is only marginally stable. The destruction processes
alter the attractor structure completely. With a cross inhibition the linear autocatalysis is suﬃcient
for the chiral symmetry breaking with a complete homochirality. With a back reaction, the quadratic
autocatalysis is necessary to bring about the chiral symmetry breaking. The ﬁnal ee is not complete
if there is a racemization process.

INTRODUCTION

Because of the three-dimensional tetragonal arrange-
ment of four chemical bonds around a carbon atom, or-
ganic molecules can take two types of stereostructures; a
right-handed one and a mirror-image left-handed one.1,7
The molecules which have either of these two forms are
called chiral, and the two forms are enantiomers with
each other. In general the two types are classiﬁed in R
and S forms, but, for sugars and amino acids, D and
L representations are common in use. From energetic
point of view, the two enantiomers are indistinguishable
and they should exist with equal probability.
In fact,
in the usual chemical reactions both types of enatiomers
are produced with equal probabilities, and the product
is called a racemate or a racemic mixture.

In contrast,

enantiomers:

life on earth utilizes only one type
levorotatory(L)-amino acids
of
and
dextrorotatory(D)-sugars. This symmetry breaking in
chirality is called the homochirality, and the origin of
this unique chirality selection has long been intriguing
many scientists.1 Various mechanisms have been pro-
posed to induce an asymmetry in the primordial molecu-
lar environment,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 but the induced chiral asym-
metry in all the proposed models is expected to be very
minute. Therefore, the mechanisms to amplify enor-
mously the enatiometric excess (ee) are indispensable.

Frank is the ﬁrst to show that an autocatalytic chem-
ical reaction with an antagonistic process in open sys-
tems can lead to an ampliﬁcation of ee.9 Many theoret-
ical models have since been proposed, but they are of-
ten criticized as lacking any experimental support.1 Re-
cently, a ﬁrst system which shows the spontaneous am-
pliﬁcation of ee has been found by Soai’s group.11,12,13,14
This enhancement takes place in a closed system, and is
explained by the second-order autocatalytic reaction.14
Inspired by these experiments,11,12,13,14 we constructed
some simple models of autocatalytic chemical reactions
in a closed and conserved system,15,16 and studied con-
ditions when the chiral symmetry breaking is possible.

§

In

Here we extend these models and study them in detail.
2, we summarize the fundamental aspects of au-
tocatalytic reaction models where two enantiomers com-
pete against each other in a closed system for the lim-
ited resource.15 The ee ampliﬁcation is found possi-
ble if the production of chiral molecules contains the
quadratic autocatalytic process. However, concentra-
tions of enantiomers are attracted to a ﬁxed line, which
is only marginally stable. Therefore, the ﬁnal conﬁg-
uration might be susceptible to external perturbation.

In
tion, the complete homochirality is concluded if there is
a linear autocatalysis. In

quadratic autocatalysis is found necessary for the chiral-
ity selection. Summary and discussions are given in the

II. AUTOCATALYTIC REACTIONS IN A
CLOSED SYSTEM

We start our study about reaction models with au-
tocatalytic productions of chiral molecules from achiral
materials. Frank9 has considered the chiral symmetry
breaking in an open chemical system. However, since the
experiment is performed in a closed system,12 we con-
sider reaction models in a closed and conserved system,
and explore eﬀects that the autocatalysis alone can lead.
Suppose two achiral molecules A and B react to pro-
duce a chiral molecule C. For the purpose of simplicity
we denote (R)-C molecule as R and (S)-C molecule as
S pro-
S, hereafter. The reactions A+B
ceed in a closed system, and thus they stop when the
materials A and/or B are exhausted. Here we assume
that there is an ample amount of material B, and its
concentration can be regarded as constant all through
the reaction. Then, the process depends only on the con-
centrations of A, R and S molecules, which we denote
a, r and s, respectively. The conservation of the total
number of participating molecules gives the relation that

R and A+B

the total concentration stays constant determined by the
initial values as

a + r + s = a0 + r0 + s0 = c0 = const.

Then the reaction developement can be depicted as a ﬂow
in the r-s phase diagram. The conservation law (1) limits
the phase space in the triangular region

As a ﬁrst step we consider the simplest autocatalytic

We now study the ﬂow diagram in r

s space in typical
situations. First we search ﬁxed points of Eq.(3) in the
region (2). It is easy to ﬁnd that a = 0 gives a line of ﬁxed
points at r + s = c0, which are stable and correspond to
the state where all the material A is consummed up. Only
for the case without nonautocatalysis, k0 = 0, another
ﬁxed point is possible at the origin r = s = 0, but it is
easily shown to be unstable.

Integration of this equation for general f (x) can be car-
ried out analytically, but we discuss the ﬂow lines only
in three typical cases in the following.

Nonautocatalytic case:
Without autocatalysis, k0 > 0 but k1 = k2 = 0, ﬂow
lines are easily obtained by interation of eq.(5) and they
s0 =constant, as shown in
have a unit slope, r

Linearly autocatalitic case:
With only a linear autocatalysis, k1 > 0, k0 = k2 = 0,
the integration of eq.(5) is easy to yield the trajectory
r/s = r0/s0 =constant. The ﬂow is represented by lines
projecting out from the origin, as shown in Fig.1(b).

•

Quadratically autocatalytic case:
For a quadratically autocatalytic case, k2 > 0, k0 =
k1 = 0, ﬂow lines are a collection of hyperbolae projecting
out from the origin, 1/r
1/s0 =constant,
as shown in Fig.1(c).

1/s = 1/r0

metry breaking, we use an order parameter φ deﬁned as

Nonautocatalytic case:
For the non-autocatalytic case in Fig.1(a), the nu-
merator r

lution whereas the denominator r + s increases. Thus
the ee decreases monotonously from the initial value

ural from the microscopic point of view, since the nonau-

Linearly autocatalytic case:

r/s remains constant and so does the ee.
Quadratically autocatalytic case:
Only with a nonlinear autocatalysis in Fig.1(c), the ee
increases up to some saturation value

Fig.2. This asymptotic value of φ∞ depends on the initial
concentrations r0 and s0, even when the initial φ0 and
the total c0 are ﬁxed, as shown in Fig.2. The smaller the
initial amount of chiral molecules (r0 + s0) are, the more
the ee is ampliﬁed.
General case:
For more general cases, the ee ampliﬁcation is ex-
plained by studying the evolution of φ, which is derived
from eq.(3) as

observed, since the concentration of A material, a, and
the sum of R and S products, c0
a = r + s, should
always be positive. The situation does not alter by in-
cluding only a linear autocatalysis with k1 > 0: it does
not directly aﬀect the evolution of φ. Only when the
quadratic auatocatalysis dominates at k2 > 4k0/c2
0, the
ee can increase. Therefore, in this simplest model only
the quadratic autocatalysis can enhance the chiral assym-
metry. This may correspond to the situation observed in
the Soai reaction.
It has to be noted that the asymp-
totic value φ∞ cannot be determined from eq.(7), since
lim
t→∞

a(t) = 0 in the present model.

Even though the ampliﬁcation of the enatiometric ex-
cess or the ampliﬁcation of the chiral assymmetry can be
brought about by the nonlinear autocatalysis, the ﬁnal
state of the system is on the line of ﬁxed points, and
thus the ﬁnal values of ee can be anything depending on
the initial condition. Since these points are marginally
stable, i.e. they have no quaranteed stability along the
direction of the ﬁxed line, they may be susceptible to ad-
ditional perturbations. We now consider the eﬀect of two
types of destructive reactions of chiral molecules.

III. WITH CROSS INHIBITION

Frank has introduced the mutual antagonism between
the enantiomers, R and S, and succeeded in explaining
the chiral symmetry breaking in an open reaction system.
Here we extend his model to the closed system. The reac-
tion equation now incorporates terms of cross inhibition
as

A. Fixed points

Fixed points have to satisfy the relation

f (r)a = f (s)a = µrs.

(9)

The simplest solution is a = 0 and rs = 0, which cor-
responds to the end corners of the triangular region,
(r, s) = (c0, 0) and (0, c0). These are easily shown to
be stable with complete homochirality, φ =
1. Other
ﬁxed points are also possible with a nonzero a and
f (r) = f (s) = µrs/a. We shall study them in various
cases below.

Nonautocatalytic case:
Only with a nonautocatalytic reaction (k0 > 0, k1 =

passing through the two terminal points (r, s) = (c0, 0)
and (0, c0). This line is an accumulation of inﬁnitely
many marginal ﬁxed points. In fact the ﬂow trajectory
s0 =constant, the same
s = r0
is easily integrated as r
lines with a unit slope obtained in the previous section
without cross inhibition. The cross inhibition only shifts
the ﬁxed line from the border r + s = c0 in Fig.1(a) to
the hyperbola (10).

With a ﬁnite k1 as well as k0, a ﬁxed line is replaced

by a symmetric ﬁxed point U at

At k0 = 0, there appears an additional ﬁxed point at
the origin r = s = 0. All these ﬁxed points are easily
shown to be unstable, as shown in Fig.3(b). The only
stable ﬁxed points are those at the corners, (c0, 0) and
(0, c0), with the complete homochirality. Thus, with only
a linear autocatalysis and without any nonlinear ones,
complete homochirality is possible with a cross inhibition
even in a closed system.

(8)

With quadratic autocatalysis, the overall structure of
the ﬂow is similar to the case with a linear autocatalysis.

The rate k1 of the linear autocatalytic process is not in-
volved in the symmetry breaking eﬀect of φ neither in the
present case with cross inhibition nor in the case with-
out cross inhibition in the previous section. One notices
the similarity between the evolution equation (12) and
eq.(7) derived in the previous section. The eﬀect of the
quadratic autocatalytic reaction, k2, in eq.(7) is replaced
by µ/a in eq.(12). In the present case, the symmetry re-
covering eﬀect k0 weakens as the material A is consumed
(a
1 is
0), and the complete homochirality φ =
achieved asymptotically. For example, the time evolution
of r/c0, s/c0 and φ is depicted in Fig.4 at k0 = 0, k1c0 =
1, µc0 = 1 and r0/c0 = 0.0714, s0/c0 = 0.0700, φ0 = 0.01.
Initially r and s increase simultaneously to approach the
symmetric ﬁxed point U: (r/c0, s/c0)=(1/3,1/3) with a
constant φ
φ0, driven by the linear autocatalytic pro-
cess k1. However, since U is unstable, the trajectory is
eventually expelled from U and r increases at the cost of
s. As a result φ increases to the full homochirality.

It is trivial that a = 0 cannot be a ﬁxed point any more

simple cases.

FIG. 6: Time evolution of the ee φ with nonlinear autocatal-

and (b) with a ﬁnte k0 = 0.05.

(13)

Since the back reaction is linear in the product concen-
trations r and s, the evolution of the ee remains the same
with eq.(7). Therefore, the quadratic autocatalysis with
a ﬁnite k2 is the necessity to break the chiral symmetry in
the present case. Even though φ follows the same evolu-
tion (7) without the back reaction, its asmptotic behavior

•

Linearly autocatalytic case:
With only a linear autocatalysis k1 > 0, k0 = k2 = 0,
we have only a trivial ﬁxed point at the origin (r, s) =
(0, 0), when the rate of back reaction is as large as
λ
there will be no net production of chiral
C molecules because of strong back reaction. On the

k1c0:

≥

contrary, when the rate of back reaction is small as
λ < k1c0, there are additional ﬁxed points on a line
λ/k1. This line corresponds to the one
r + s = c0
−
2 shifted by the back reaction λ. In fact
r + s = c0 in
§
the trajectory is the same as in
2 and radiates from the
origin r/s = r0/s0 =constant, as shown in Fig.5(b).

§

•

Quadratically autocatalytic case:
With a quadratic autocatalysis k2 > 0, k0 = k1 = 0,
the back reaction decimates the ﬁxed line r + s = c0 and
produces several ﬁxed points. One of them is a trivial
ﬁxed point at the origin (r, s) = (0, 0), which is of no
interest.

(1) With a small rate of back reaction, λ < k2c2

0/8,
there are other six ﬁxed points: two on the r axis,
U1 : (A−, 0) and S1 : (A+, 0), two on the s axis,
U2 : (0, A−) and S2 : (0, A+), and two symmetric
ones, U3 : (B−, B−) and U4 : (B+, B+), with

respond to the states with complete homochirality
with φ =
1. Except the region around the trivial
ﬁxed point O, the phase ﬂow is attracted to one of
these two homochiral states, S1 or S2. Generally,
the region of initial points which will eventually be
attracted to a certain ﬁxed point is called the basin
s phase
of attraction. In the present case, the r
space is divided into three basins of attractions to
S1, S2, and O, by separatrixes U3U1, U3U2, and
U3M.

The time evolution of the order parameter φ is de-
picted in Fig.6(a) with the parameters k0 = k1 =
0, k2c2
0 = 1, λc0 = 0.1, the same ones used to obtain
the ﬂow diagram in Fig.5(c). The initial condition
is r0 = 0.2 + 0.001, s0 = 0.2. The ﬂow is almost
s ﬁrst and approaches to the
symmetric as r
symmetric ﬁxed point U4, but since U4 is unstable
r starts to increase at the cost of s and eventually
φ approaches the full value, unity.

≈

(2) As the back reaction rate increases, two symmetric
ﬁxed points U3 and U4 merge to disappear for λ

k2c2
0/4. There remains two homochiral ﬁxed points
S1 and S2. Their basins of attraction are close to
the r or s axes. Close to the diagonal r = s the ﬂow
runs to the trivial ﬁxed point O. The separatrixes
of three basins of attractions are U1M1 and U2M2.
With the parameter values k2c2
0 = 1, λ = 0.2, ﬁxed

points S1 and S2 are determined with parameters
A+ = 0.7236c0 and A− = c0
A+, as shown in
Fig.5(d).

(3) Finally, when the back reaction is too strong as

k2c2

λ

≥

0/4, all the ﬂow runs to the origin.

•

Linear and quadratic autocatalysis:
We consider now the eﬀect of a linear autocatalytic
process in addition to the quadratic autocatalysis k2. As
far as k1 is smaller than λ/c0, the origin r = s = 0
s
is attractive, and the schematics of the ﬂow in the r
phase space is the same with those for k1 = 0. When k1 is
larger than λ/c0, the origin r = s = 0 looses the stability,
and there are only three ﬁxed points: two stable ones on
r and s axes S1: (C, 0) and S2: (0, C) and a symmetric
and unstable one at U: (D, D) with

Autocatalysis with nonautocatalytic production
We found that the quadratic autocatalysis with back
reaction permits to attain the homochiral situation, if
there are a few C molecules initially outside the basin of
attractive to the origin r = s = 0. In order to actuate
the autocatalysis, however, one has to provide initial C
molecules. Therefore, nonautocatalytic production with
a ﬁnite k0 seems necessary. We now consider cases when
the random creation of racemic mixtures by k0 coexist
with the autocatalytic production as well as the back
reaction.

(1) With a linear autocatalysis k0 > 0, k1 > 0, k2 =
0, λ > 0, the ﬁxed line for k0 = 0 in Fig.5(b) is
replaced by a symmetric ﬁxed point at

which is stable and φ = 0. Random racemization
eﬀect by k0 dominates and recovers the symmetric
state.

(2) With a quadratic autocatalysis k0 > 0, k2 >
0, k1 = 0, the situation is rather complex. Since

If k0 is smaller than k2c2
0/16, the function Λa(r) in
eq.(18) has two peaks with a height λmax = k2c2
0/4,
as shown in Fig.7(a). It also has a local minimum
value λmin = 2√k0(c0√k2
k0/k2.
Then for small λ < λmin there are two solutions of
asymmetric ﬁxed points which are stable, for inter-
mediate case with λmin < λ < λmax there are four
solutions two among them are stable and two other
are unstable, and for large λ > λmax there is none.
If k0 lies between k2c2
0/4, Λa(r)
has only a single peak with a value λ′
max =
2√k0). Therefore the number of so-
2√k0(c0√k2
lutions are two for small λ < λ′
min which are stable,
and none for large λ.
Further larger k0 > k2c2
0/4, there is no asymmetric
ﬁxed point for any λ. The last result is already
drawn by the time evolution of φ given in Eq.(7),
which is valid in the present case, too.

Fig.7(b). For a small rate k0
0/108, the num-
bers of symmetric ﬁxed points depends on λ. For a
small λ, there is one unstable, for an intermediate
value of λ there are three among which one is stable
and two unstable, and for a large λ there remains
only one stable one. For example, by adding k0
as small as k0 = 0.05(> k2c2
0/108) to the situation
shown in Fig.5(c), the origin looses the stability and
there remains only a single symmetric ﬁxed point
which is unstable. Therefore, the ﬂow diagram re-
duces to the one shown in Fig.5(f). The achieved
ee is not complete, but is very large if k0 is small,
as shown in Fig.6(b). There the initial condition
is chosen as r0 = 0.1 + 0.001 and s = 0.1, but the
ﬁnal φ deos not depend on the initial values of r0
or s0.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

We studied various autocatalytic models with back re-
action or with cross inhibition processes to search for the
conditions to achieve the chirality selection in a closed
system. The results are summarized in the Table 1.

As for the symmetric solutions with r = s, the
eﬀect of random creation k0 is more eﬀective. Since

the number of ﬁxed points reduces to one which is
unstable if k0 is larger than k2c2
0/108, as shown in

TABLE I: Classiﬁcation of reaction models with parameters
deﬁned in the bottom column. Symbol ≥ means that the
value is non-negative and > means that the value must be
positive. B means that the ﬁnal state is chiral symmetry
breaking and S means otherwise. Details for each entry are
explained in the indicated sections.

If the production of chiral molecules R and S from
the achiral material A involves a linear autocatalysis, the
cross inhibition between R and S is necessary to realise
the homochirality, as is summarized for the cases (1)-(4)
in Table 1. The case (3) corresponds to an extension of
Frank’s model to a closed chemical system.

With a quadratic autocatalysis, the ampliﬁcation of
enantiomeric excess (ee) is achieved without any destruc-
tion process, but the steady state can have any ﬁnite
value of ee (
1), as the stable ﬁxed line exists
1
1. In fact the ﬁnal value
extending from φ = 1 to φ =
of ee depends on the details of the initial values of chiral
as well as achiral materials’ concentrations. Therefore
we do not regard this case (1) as the chiral symmetry

breaking in a restricted sense.

With a linear back reaction process and a quadratic
autocatalysis as a special case of (5), the complete ho-
mochirality is possible to realize when the rate of back
reaction is suﬃciently small. The minority enantiomer
is decomposed back to the material A and recycled to
produce the majority enantiomer and vice versa. This
decomposition process works more eﬀectively for the mi-
nority because of the suppressed production due to the
nonlinear autoctalysis.

However, with only autocatalytic processes, the initial
production of chiral molecules is impossible. Therefore,
the random production of chiral molecules by the nonau-
tocatalytic process described by a nonzero value of coeﬃ-
cent k0 is indispensable. For a small value of k0, the phase
space structure of the ﬂow and ﬁxed points is not qual-
itatively aﬀected and resembles with that of vanishing
k0 case. However, for k0 greater than the critical value
k2c2
0/108, this process aﬀects the structure of racemic
ﬁxed points so drastically that the system can have only
almost homochiral states as stable ﬁxed points, as shown
in Fig.5(f).

We have studied two types of simple models (3) and
(5) where the chiral symmetry can be broken in the
closed system and complete or almost complete homochi-
ral states can be achieved. One type of the model with
the cross inhibition (3) seems powerful for this purpose,
but the chemical system which shows this process has not
been found so far and it is very interesting to ﬁnd actual

chemical system. On the other hand, the nonlinear auto-
catalytic system is found by Soai’s group and thus, there
is a real possibility for a nonlinear autocatalytic model
with back reaction (5) to exist. But we are not certain
whether the back reaction proceeds in a measurerable
time for the experiment.

From these analysis of present simple models based
on closed systems, we would like to venture to specu-
late a possible scenario for the initial preparation of con-
stituent materials of life as follows. In a conﬁned nook
and cranny somewhere in the premordial sea, there was a
very favorable conditions for the autocatalytic reactions
to take place and after a suﬃciently long time, the initial
homochiral selection was established. Once this selec-
tion was completed in this tiny closed corner, the chiral
molecules began to spread out and to conquer eventually
the surrounding region and futher all over the earth.

So far, we have assumed that the system is homoge-
nious, such that the whole system is described by only
a space-independent concentrations. In the actual situa-
tions, the concentrations should vary in space. We have
introduced a lattice model for the reaction-diﬀusion sys-
tem and studied the spreading of chiral symmetry break-
ing. The interested readers are invited to refer to the
original paper.16

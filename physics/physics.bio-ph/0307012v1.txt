Abstract

The eﬃciency of a Brownian particle moving in periodic potential in the presence of asymmetric

unbiased ﬂuctuations is investigated. We found that there is a regime where the eﬃciency can be

a peaked function of temperature, which proves that thermal ﬂuctuations facilitate the eﬃciency

of energy transformation, contradicting the earlier ﬁndings (H. kamegawa et al. Phys. Rev. Lett.

80 (1998) 5251). It is also found that the mutual interplay between asymmetry of ﬂuctuation and

asymmetry of the potential may induce optimized eﬃciency at ﬁnite temperature. The ratchet is

not most eﬃciency when it gives maximum current.

1. INTRODUCTION

Much of the interest in non-equilibrium induced transport processes in concentrated on

stochastically driven rachet [1][2][3]. This subject was motivated by the challenge to explain

unidirectional transport in biological systems, as well as their potential novel technologi-

cal applications ranging from classical non-equilibrium models [4][5] to quantum systems

[6][7][8]. Several models have been proposed to describe muscle’s contraction[9][10][11], or

the asymmetric polymerization of actin ﬁlaments responsible of cell motility[1][12].

Rectiﬁcation of noise leading to unidirectional motion in ratchet systems has been an

active ﬁeld of research over the last decade. In these systems directed Brownian motion of

particles is induced by nonequilibrium noise in the absence of any net macroscopic forces

and potential gradients. Several physical models have been proposed: rocking ratchets

[13], fashing ratchets [14], diﬀusion ratchets [15], correlation ratchets [16], etc. In all these

studies the potential is taken to be asymmetric in space. It has also been shown that one can

obtain unidirectional current in the presence of spatially asymmetric potentials. For these

nonequilibrium systems external random force should be time asymmetric or the presence

of space dependent mobility is required.

The energetics of these systems, which rectify the zero-mean ﬂuctuations, are investi-

gated in recent years [17][18][19]. To deﬁne optimal models for such ratchet systems, the

maximization of the eﬃciency of energy transformation is inevitable. Much of interest was

motivated by the elegant piece of work done by Magnasco [13], which showed that a Brow-

nian particle, subject to external ﬂuctuations, can undergo a non-zero drift while moving

under the inﬂuence of an asymmetric potential. The temperature dependence of the cur-

rent has been studied and it has been shown that the current can be a peaked function

of temperature. He claimed that there is a region where the eﬃciency can be optimized

at ﬁnite temperatures and the existence of thermal ﬂuctuations facilitate the eﬃciency of

energy transformation. Based on energetic analysis of the same model Kamegawa et al.

[19] made a important conclusion that the eﬃciency of energy transformation cannot be

optimized at ﬁnite temperatures and that the thermal ﬂuctuations does not facilitate it.

Recently, investigation of Dan et al.

[17] showed that the eﬃciency can be optimized at

ﬁnite temperatures in inhomogeneous systems with spatially varying friction coeﬃcient in

an adiabatically rocked rachet, and eﬃciency optimization in homogeneous nonadiabatical

2

rachet systems was observed by Sumithra et al.[18]. The equation of whether the thermal

ﬂuctuations actually facilitate the energy transformation in forced homogeneous adiabatical

ratchet systems is still unknown and it is the subject of the current investigation.

2. THE MODEL

We consider a rocking ratchet system subject to an external load:

dt

= −

∂V0(x)
∂x

−

∂VL(x)
∂x

+ F (t) +

2kBT ξ(t),

q

(1)

where x represents the state of the ratchet. V0 is a periodic potential, ξ(t) is a ran-

domly ﬂuctuating Gaussian white noise with zero mean and with autocorrelation function<

ξ(t)ξ(s) >= δ(t − s). Here < ... > denotes an ensemble average over the distribution of the
ﬂuctuating forces ξ(t). VL is a potential against which the work is done and ∂VL

∂x = L > 0 is
the load force. The geometry of potential V (x) = V0(x) + VL(x) is displayed in Fig. 1a. F (t)

is some external driving force which is shown in Fig.1b. The evolution of the probability

density for x is given by the associated Fokker-Planck equation,

∂P (x, t)
∂t

=

[kBT

∂x

∂P (x, t)
∂x

′

+ (V

(x) − F (t))P (x, t)] = −

∂x

.

If F (t) changes very slowly, there exists a quasi-stationary state.

In this case, the aver-

age current of the particle can be solved by evaluating the constants of integration under

the normalization condition and the periodicity condition of P (x), and the current can be

obtained and expressed as [13]

j(F (t)) =

2 sinh[λ(F (t) − L)/2kBT ]
kBT (λ/Q)2P3 − (λ/Q)P1P2 sinh[λ(F (t) − L)/2kBT ]

P3 = cosh{[Q − 0.5∆(F (t) − L)]/kBT } − cosh[λ(F (t) − L)/2kBT ],

where λ = λ1 + λ2 and ∆ = λ1 − λ2. The average current, the quantity of primary

interest, is given by

and periodic potential. VL is a potential due to the load. The period of the potential is λ = λ1 +λ2,

and ∆ = λ1 − λ2. (b) The driving force F (t) which preserved the zero mean < F (t) >= 0, where

the temporal asymmetry is given by the parameter ε.

where τ is the period of the driving force F (t), which is assumed longer than any other time

scale of the system in this adiabatic limit. Magnasco considered this case, but only for F (t)

symmetric in time. Here will again consider a driving with a zero mean, < F (t) >= 0, but

which is asymmetric in time [20]

where j1 = (1 − ε)j( 1+ε

The input energy R per unit time from external force to the ratchet and the work W

per unit time that the ratchet system extracts from the ﬂuctuation into the work are given

respectively[19]:

For the square wave, they yield:

Thus the eﬃciency η of the system to transform the external ﬂuctuation to useful work

is given by

ε = −0.5, −0.6, −0.7, −0.8, F = 1.0, λ = 1.0 ,∆ = 0.7, Q = 1.0 and L = 0.01. The inset shows the

net current J as function of T for the same parameters.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

we have calculated the eﬃciency and the net current as a function of temperature T for

the case where asymmetric unbiased ﬂuctuations are applied, and the results are shown in

Fig. 2- Fig. 6.

In Fig. 2 we plot the eﬃciency η as a function of the temperature for diﬀerent values of ε

(ε < 0) with the parameter values, F = 1.0, λ = 1.0, ∆ = 0.7, Q = 1.0 and L = 0.01. From

the ﬁgure we can see that the eﬃciency is a decreasing function of temperature for the cases

of ε = −0.5 and ε = −0.6, which shows that the presence of thermal ﬂuctuation dose not

help eﬃcient energy transformation by ratchet. But for the cases of ε = −0.7 and ε = −0.8

the eﬃciency can be optimized at ﬁnite temperatures. In contradiction with the results of

Ref (19) we found a region where the eﬃciency attains a maximum at a ﬁnite temperature.

This shows that thermal ﬂuctuations may facilitate the energy conversion for asymmetric

unbiased ﬂuctuations. The current is a peaked function of temperature for corresponding

parameters as shown in the inset. The highest temperature of the ratchet decreases with

the value of the asymmetric parameters ε of ﬂuctuations and the lowest temperature of

6

the ratchet does not change with the ε, which indicates that the asymmetric parameters

are sensitive to the highest working temperature of the ratchet. The peak shift to lower

temperature region with decreasing value of the asymmetric parameters ε. Comparing Fig.

2 with the inset we can see that the temperature corresponding to maximum current is not

the same as the temperature at which the eﬃciency is maximum, which is consistent with

the previous results [17][18][19].

From Eq.

(16) we can know that the eﬃciency η depends on the ratio | j2

j1 |.

If the

function is monotonically increasing, η should be a monotonically decreasing function of the

temperature.

In Fig. 3 we plot the ﬂuxes obtained for the case of ε = −0.5 (shown in

Fig. 2). From Fig. 3 we can see that the ratio | j2

j1 | is a monotonically increasing function
of temperature, which indicates that the eﬃciency η is decreasing function of temperature.
However, for the case of ε = −0.7 (see Fig. 4) the ratio | j2

j1 | displays a clear minimum at the

same value of the temperature which corresponds to maximum of η in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 5 we plot the eﬃciency η as a function of the temperature T for diﬀerent values

of slope degree of potenial ∆ (∆ < 0) with the parameter values, F = 1.0, λ = 1.0, ε = 0.7,

Q = 1.0 and L = 0.01. From the ﬁgure, we can see that with decreasing of ∆ the eﬃciency

function of temperature becomes from a monotonically decreasing function to a peaked func-

tion. This shows that the thermal ﬂuctuations actually facilitate the energy transformation

4. CONCLUSION

In present paper, the transport of a Brownian particle moving in spatially asymmetric po-

tential in the presence of asymmetric unbiased ﬂuctuations is investigated. In contradiction

with the previous ﬁndings, our results show that the mutual interplay between asymmetry

of ﬂuctuation and asymmetry of potential may cause an optimized eﬃciency of energy con-

version. This proves the claim made by Magnasco that there is a region of the operating

9

regime where the eﬃciency can be optimized at ﬁnite temperatures. The temperature corre-

sponding to maximum current is not the same as the temperature at which the eﬃciency is

maximum. The asymmetry εof ﬂuctuation is sensitive to the high temperature working re-

gion of the ratchet while the asymmetry ∆ of potential aﬀects the low temperature working

region drastically.

In this paper, the main features introduced by the temporal asymmetry are the inter-

play of lower potential barriers in positive direction relative to negative direction and the

corresponding shorter and longer times respectively the force is felt. These type of competi-

tive eﬀects appear ubiquitously in systems [20] where there is an interplay between thermal

activation and dynamics.

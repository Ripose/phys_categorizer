Abstract

The enzyme Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the decom-

position of glucose. The gene that produces the GAPDH is therefore present in a wide class

of organisms. We show that for this gene the average value of the ﬂuctuations in nucleotide

distribution in the codons, normalized to strand bias, provides a reasonable measure of how the

gene has evolved in time.

Evolution makes lower organisms into higher ones. The distribution of the nucleotides in the genes

that code for proteins undergo changes in the process. It is sometimes assumed these variations in the

nucleotide distributions come about due to random mutations. In this work we present quantitative

evidence that the changes in the bases of the GAPDH are remarkably well ordered.

The DNA sequence that codes for a single protein evolves as we go from one organism to the

next. The evolution of the base composition of A, T, G and C for the same protein is the key to the

dynamics of biological evolution. Some proteins are restricted to few organisms, others are more com-

mon. Amongst these proteins / enzymes, the glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is

present in all living organisms, as the key enzyme in glycolysis, the common pathway both in organ-

isms that live in free oxygen and the ones that do not. The GAPDH catalyzes the dehydrogenation

and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

The nature of the base organisation of the DNA sequences and the direction of the changes due

to evolution have been studied in the recent years [1]. The fractal correlations of 1

f β type have been

reported. These fractal correlations are more pronounced for the introns and the intergenic ﬂanks.

The exons, on the other hand, are characterised by strong peak at f= 1

3 in the power spectrum.

Here we work only with the exon regions and attempt to isolate the physical quantity that provides

insights into the nature of evolution in the GAPDH.

With this in mind we picked the DNA sequences coding for the GAPDH enzyme from a wide

variety of prokaryotes (the lower organisms) and eukaryotes (roughly the higher organisms).

3

Zuckerkandl and Pauling [2] laid the basis for the study of genes and proteins for evolution. Over

the years there have been the search for the universal common ancestor [3] that may have preceded

the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes. The studies on the ribosomal RNA provided some of the in-

sights [4]. The relative importance of the elements, such as mutations, lateral gene transfer [5], that

drive the evolution of species continues to be under active investigation. In our work here with the

GAPDH we try to isolate the physical quantity (called X) that measures the evolution in this gene.

4

Number Fluctuations

The coding sequences of the GAPDH genes from 42 diﬀerent species, with 31 eukaryotes and 11

prokaryotes, were chosen. These sequences have diﬀerent distribution of the bases A, T, G and C.

Since the codons are made of 3 of these bases, we divide the sequence into codons, i.e. choose the

window size 3 bases long.

On these windows of size 3, we compute the square of the numbers of A, T, G and C and deﬁne

N(3) as:

N(3) = n2

A(3) + n2

T (3) + n2

G(3) + n2

C(3)

where n2

A(3),n2

T (3),n2

G(3),n2

C(3) are the numbers of A, T, G and C respectively in the codon window of

size 3. Thus if, for instance, A occurs in all the three positions we get N(3)=9. If two are identical we

get N(3)=4+1=5. If all the positions are occupied by diﬀerent nucleotides, we get N(3)=1+1+1=3.

Thus N(3), for the window size 3, varies from 3 to 9 as we go from one codon to the next along

the gene. We then compute the average value of N(3), call it < N(3) >, over the sequence. We

notice here that a high value of < N(3) > implies repeats of the bases. This means persistent sort of

correlation amongst the bases. In other words, higher value of < N(3) > implies a higher probability

that the A, for instance, is going to be followed by the A. Conversely a lower value of < N(3) >

implies an antipersistent order in the sequence leading to a lower probability for the A to be followed

immediately by the A.

5

What do we expect for < N(3) > for the random sequence of identical strand bias? Strand bias is

the proportion of A, T, G and C in the sequence. These proportions vary as we go from one GAPDH

sequence to another. We want to isolate the eﬀect above and beyond the strand bias, therefore,

study the quantity X deﬁned as:

X =

< N(3) >
< N(3, r) >

(1)

where < N(3, r) > is the average value of the quantity deﬁned in (6) for the random sequence of

identical total length and strand bias.

< N(3) > is measured for the sequences, while < N(3, r) > is calculated using a 4-dimensional

walk [6,7] model. Hence the quantity X is obtained.

To calculate < N(3, r) > consider the following walk model in 4-dimensions corresponding to A,

T, G and C. If we encounter the symbol i (i=A, T, G and C) we move one step along i. In this

directed walk the probability function for a single step clearly is :

P1(x) = X
i

piδ(xi − 1)

(2)

where x≡(xA,xT ,xG,xC), and pi= ni

N ; ni is the number of times the symbol i appears in the sequence;

N is the total number of symbols, i.e. the length of the sequence. We want to get the distributions

after m steps, and therefore, deﬁne the characteristic function of the single step:

˜P1(k) = X

pieiki.

(3)

i

6

For m steps:

˜Pm(k) = [X

pieiki]m

i

(4)

The quantity m is clearly the total number of steps, i.e. the window size. The moments of the

distribution may be obtained by diﬀerentiating ˜Pm(k) with respect to k. In particular < N(3, r) >

is just the second moment of distribution and obtained from ˜Pm(k):

Using (4) and (5), we get:

< N(3, r) > = [X
i

∂2 ˜Pm(k)

∂k2
i

]ki→0

< N(3, r) > = m[(m − 1) X p2

i + 1]

(5)

(6)

where we have used the relation P pi = 1.

To crosscheck this relation, let us ﬁrst set pA=1; pT =pG=pC=0. This is the case of maximal

persistence. All the three bases, in this limit, are identical. From (6), we ﬁnd:

< N(3, r) > = 9,

as we expect.

To check again set pA=pT =pG=pC= 1

4. The average value, from (6), gives:

< N(3, r) > = 4.5

(7)

(8)

For the window size m=3 the possible choices consistent with pA=pT =pG=pC= 1

4 are 4x4x4=64,

namely, the 61 codons + 3 stop codons. Calculation of the < N(3, r) > for these 64 combinations is

7

straightforward and gives the value 4.5 in agreement with (8).

Nucleotide Sequence Comparison

The pairwise sequence alignment tool [8] available in the public domain gives a measure of the

‘‘distance′ ′ (or the cross correlations) between the sequences. These distances provide additional

data towards the study of evolution in the GAPDH gene.

In the usual studies of evolution and phylogeny one relies exclusively on nucleotide sequence

comparison. The rules used for alignment of sequences are constructed to give rise to the known

pattern.

In contrast, the change in the value of the X appears to us as the physical quantity of interest

in the evolution in the GAPDH gene. The nucleotide sequence comparison we use in this work as

supplementary, supportive data.

The X of Evolution

The X values for the eukaryotes and the prokaryotes, for the GAPDH, for window size of 3, are given

in Table 1.

Interestingly, the table 1 suggests two parallel lines of evolution, one for the prokaryotes; the

other for the eukaryotes. Note the value of the X for the cyanobacterial genes is closer to that for

the amphibian gene. The eubacterial and archaebacterial values are more or less the same as those

8

for ﬁsh, and higher invertebrates such as arthropods.

As we look separately amongst the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes the X values increase as

follows:

Prokaryota: proteobacteria < archaebacteria < eubacteria < cyanobacteria

Eukaryota: f ungus < invertebrate < f ish < amphibia < bird < mammal (excl. human) < human

It is to be remembered that in arriving at this increasing pattern the average value of the X over

the members of the group has been considered. Within each group there are variations in the X (see

Table 1).

Assume now the GAPDH gene began from common universal ancestor. The route diverged to

give proteobacteria on one side; fungal and invertebrate genes on the other. The proteobacterial

gene develops further into three, archaebacterial, eubacterial and cyanobacterial, genes. The other

trail from the fungus goes through ﬁsh, amphibia, probably reptilia for which the data is unavailable,

birds and other mammals to reach its peak on humans.

Sequence Comparison

The pairwise alignment tool gives a measure of similarity, or distance, between the various GAPDH

genes under consideration (Figure 1).

The results are fairly consistent with the picture that emerges from the study of the X. It suggests

that the eukaryotic GAPDH genes might have originated from proteobacterial or eubacterial genes

9

[9].

The alignment tool also suggests that both archaebacteria and cyanobacteria may be quite distant

from all other groups [10,11]. As we measure the sequence similarity of the archaebacterial and the

cyanobacterial genes with genes from the other two prokaryotic groups, we ﬁnd the eubacterial gene

closer to them than the proteobacterial one. This too supports the view obtained from the X values

of the prokaryotes.

The X Evolution of the GAPDH Exon

The plot of X for eukaryotes against their approximate period of origin in the geological time scale

(Table 2) gives a fairly linear ﬁt. The slope:

Keuk =

∆X
∆T

= 1.14 × 10−4 (myr)−1,

(9)

where myr≡million years.

The earliest lifeforms are thought to come about around 3500 million years before present (myr BP).

Presently we presume them as the proteobacterial ones. If the slope of the prokaryotic GAPDH gene

X-evolution is assumed close to that for the eukaryotes, (9), then the cyanobacteria must have arisen

∆T = K −1

euk [Xcyano − Xproteo] ≈ 460 (myr)

(10)

after the proteobacteria. In myr BP this is 3500-460=3040. Similarly, the periods of origin of the

eubacteria and the archaebacteria may be arrived at, and given in Table 3 and Figure 2.

10

Fossil stromatolites are macroscopic structures produced by some species of cyanobacteria. These

are believed to occur from the early Precambrian (i.e., 3000 myr BP) to the Recent period [12]. This

is in good agreement with (10) for the time of origin of cyanobacteria obtained from the X-evolution.

For an alternate approach assume the cyanobacteria appeared around 3000 myr BP, and the

proteobacteria 3500 myr BP. The rate of change of the X, i.e.

Kpro =

Xcyano − Xproteo

∆T

= 1.05 × 10−4 (myr BP )−1

(11)

Thus the slope of the prokaryotic GAPDH gene X-evolution (11) comes out to be nearly identical to

that for the eukaryotes (9). Figure 3 shows the best linear ﬁts for the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes,

which appear as two almost parallel lines.

For the GAPDH exon the quantity X rises uniformly on two parallel paths - one for the prokary-

otes; the other for the eukaryotes. The uniformity of rise in the X with time implies the genetic

evolution is well-ordered; not the result of some random mutations.

The rise of the X implies the trend towards persistent correlations in the base arrangement of

codons. That is, as we go up the ladder of evolution the probability that a nucleotide, for instance

the A is followed by the A increases. Note the result is true for the window of size 3. Whether the

increase in persistence continues for any window size remains outside the scope of our analysis. The

11

increase in persistence in the window of size 3 gives a measure of the complexity of the sequences at

this scale [13].

For the archaebacteria the sequence comparisons indicate that they are more or less equally

distant from the other prokaryotes and the eukaryotes. Yet the X-measure of the archaebacteria

places them between the proteobacteria and the eubacteria.

The ordered, uniform X-evolution of the GAPDH exon allows us to estimate the times of origins of

eubacteria, cyanobacteria, archaebacteria. The time of origin of cyanobacteria falls near the previous

estimates.

To conclude, the GAPDH gene is shown to be a marker for evolution. Importantly, the physical

quantity X, the second moment of the codon base distribution, normalised to the strand bias, bears

the footprint of a remarkably ordered evolution.

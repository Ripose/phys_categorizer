The inﬂux of calcium ions into the dendritic spines through the N-metyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
channels is believed to be the primary trigger for various forms of synaptic plasticity. In this paper,
the authors calculate analytically the mean values of the calcium transients elicited by a spiking
neuron undergoing a simple model of ionic currents and back-propagating action potentials. The
relative variability of these transients, due to the stochastic nature of synaptic transmission, is
further considered using a simple Markov model of NMDA receptos. One ﬁnds that both the mean
value and the variability depend on the timing between pre- and postsynaptic action-potentials.
These results could have implications on the expected form of synaptic-plasticity curve and can
form a basis for a uniﬁed theory of spike time-dependent, and rate based plasticity.

many other induction protocols share a common prop-

ural coincidence detectors; their activation relies both on
the eﬃciency of neurotransmitter release from the presy-
naptic cell, and on the level of depolarization of the post-
synaptic cell. Most remarkably, they are permeable to

calcium ions, which suggests a functional link between
NMDA and calcium in the induction of LTP and LTD.

Recently several dynamical models have been proposed
to account for STDP [1, 14, 16, 27], the relationship be-
tween STDP and rate based models has been examined
using averaging methods[15, 29], and there have been at-
tempts to account for receptive ﬁeld formation on the
basis of STDP [31]. We have recently proposed a uniﬁed
theory of synaptic plasticity [28] based on the following
assumptions: (1) the level of intracellular calcium con-
centration determines the sign and magnitude of synatp-
cic plasticity [2, 3, 19]: when calcium falls below a thresh-
old θd, no plasticity occurs, when it falls between θd and
θp, θp > θd, LTD is induced, and for calcium above θp,
LTP is induced; (2) the relevant sources of calcium are
the NMDA channels; and (3) dendritic back-propagating
action potentials (BPAPs) contributing to STDP have
a slow ”after-depolarizing” tail component. We have
shown that these simplifying assumptions are suﬃcient to
account for the various experimental plasticity-induction
protocols.
In addition, this model has also produced
previously uncharacterized predictions, such as: (a) the
shape of the STDP learning curve should be frequency-
dependent; and (b) there should be a novel form of
spike time-dependent LTD for ∆t larger than the LTP-
inducing intervals. Recent experimental results are con-
sistant with these predictions [24, 30].

In this paper, we present a systematic calculation of
the calcium transients as a function of pre- and post-

spike timings, as well as of the neuronal ﬁring rates. In
section II we derive the solution for the mean calcium
transients, in the simplest case where the BPAP consists
of a single exponential, and show that its dependence on
∆t is rather intuitive. A more realistic approach is taken
in section III, where the BPAP is composed of a sum
of two exponentials with diﬀerent time constants. This
more complex assumption agrees with our previous work
[28] and is consistent with experimental observations [20].
The analysis shows that the slow component is necessary
for having diﬀerent calcium levels in the baseline condi-
tion (pre only) and the post-pre condition (∆t < 0) while
the fast component sharpens the diﬀerence of the calcium
levels in the transition between post/pre (∆t < 0) and
pre/post (∆t > 0) conditions. The sharpness of this tran-
sition is shown to be further enhanced by the appropri-
ate choice of the calcium passive decaying time-constant.
For completeness, in section IV, we study the eﬀects of
the calcium-accumulation due to repetitive ﬁring which
aﬀects the rate-dependence of some plasticity-induction
protocols including the STDP learning window. Finally,
in section V we take into account the stochastic prop-
erties of synaptic transmission and estimate the trial-by-
trial variability of the calcium transients. This variability
can be signiﬁcant if the number of postsynaptic NMDAR
in each spine is small. Our analysis demonstrates that
such variability varies with ∆t, being an increasing func-
tion for ∆t > 0. These results could yield signiﬁcant
consequences to the form of the STDP curve.

II. ANALYSIS OF CALCIUM INFLUX
THROUGH NMDA RECEPTORS

The postsynaptic intraspinal calcium ions are removed
from these compartments both through diﬀusion and
through binding to calcium buﬀers. Let these phenomena
be characterized by a single time constant τ , and assume
that the calcium dynamics follow a ﬁrst-order linear dif-
ferential equation,

d[Ca]
dt

= I(t)

[Ca].

where [Ca] is the intracellular calcium concentration, I(t)
is the inward calcium current, and τ is the time constant
of the passive decay process. This simple dynamics is to
the ﬁrst approximation consistent with experiments by
[21] and [26]. Given a initial condition [Ca](0), equation
1 has a solution of the form:

2

In this paper we consider the NMDA channels as the
sole source of calcium currents. These channels are volt-
age dependent [13], and have a long open time that can
usually be described as a sum of two exponentials [7],
thus its currents can be generaly described as:

In this section, however, we will focus on the simple
scenario of a single pair of pre and postsynaptic APs,
where both the NMDA receptors and the BPAP fall as a
single exponential with time constants τN and τB, respec-
tively. We will leave the more realistic two-component-
BPAP case to the next section. Unless otherwise men-
tioned, we replace the stochastic variable f by its mean
without change of notation. Thus, for a single presynap-
tic spike at time tpre, we can write,

f (t, tpre) = µΘ(t

where Θ is the Heaviside function and µ is the probabil-
ity that a channel will open given a presynaptic AP. Let
us assume that the postsynaptic depolarization is domi-
nated by the BPAP. Therefore, V in equation 3 can be
written as:

The current separates into two components, one that
depends only on the timing of the presynaptic AP (I pre)
and a second, associative term, that depends on the
relative timing between the pre- and postsynaptic APs
(I +/−). The associative term will give rise to the diﬀer-
ences between pre/post and post/pre conditions, which
is essential to the STDP learning.

The dependence of the peak current on ∆t is quite
simple (FIG. 1). For ∆t > 0 it decays exponentially
with the time constant of the NMDAR open probability
τN; whereas for ∆t < 0 it decays with τB, the width
of the BPAP. It is straightforward to see that, if ∆t < 0
yields calcium levels corresponding to LTD, and if to each
calcium concentration is associated a degree of plasticity,
there should be a ∆t > 0 region that also corresponds to
LTD. The diﬀerence is that, since τB << τN, θd in the
post/pre region is reached for values of ∆t much closer to
zero than it is for the pre/post region. Such diﬀerence will
be even greater in the case where the BPAP’s dynamic
is described by two time constants instead of one (see
section III).

Using equations 8 and 9, we can rewrite equation 2 in
terms of each of the components of the calcium current,

for the pre-post (FIG. 2a, ∆t = 10 ms) and the post-pre
(FIG. 2b, ∆t = -10 ms) conditions (dashed line). The
diﬀerence between these conditions lies in the associative
term (dash-dot line). [Ca]+ raises at the point t = tpost

ever, there are experimental indications that an addi-
tional slow after-depolarizing component exists in some
cell bodies [11] and dendrites [17, 20]. The dynamics of
the BPAP deﬁnes to what extent the postsynaptic spike-
timing interacts with the presynaptic one; in particular,
a slower decaying process ensures that such interaction
spans for a period of a tens of milliseconds, as required
by the STDP learning rule. In this section, we assume
a BPAP composed by a sum of two exponentials, with,
B and a fast τ f
respectively a slow τ s

The eﬀects of the BPAP slow component on the cal-
cium transients is shown in FIG. 3b and 4a. Since both
[Ca]+ and [Ca]− have the same linear dependence on
the magnitude vs of this slow component, it primarily
contributes to the separation between the pre-only con-
dition (diamond), and the associative conditions (circle
and square).

A longer decaying tail for the postsynaptic variable
provides a longer range of time-interval in which inter-
action with the presynaptic variables is possible. Thus,
the dynamics of the presynaptic variable, such as the
calcium time constant τ , will also inﬂuence the relative
magnitudes of the calcium transients for the pre-post and
post-pre conditions. Indeed, the combination of a faster
calcium kinetics with the diﬀerent BPAP time courses
enhances the diﬀerence between these magnitudes (FIG.
4b). Therefore, a two-component-BPAP model produces
a sharper transition of the learning curve between the

post-pre LTD and the pre-post LTP. Initial estimates of
the the calcium time constant in the spines were of the
order of 70-125ms [21, 23]. However, these values are ob-
tained through calcium imaging, whose results may de-
pend on the kinetics of the calcium indicators used, lim-
iting the accuracy of the estimates. Recent experimental
techniques, in which the eﬀect of the calcium buﬀers are
minimized, have lead to time constants of as low as 20
ms [26].

IV. RATE-DEPENDENCE OF THE CALCIUM
TRANSIENTS

In the previous sections we have analysed the calcium
transients evoked by one pair of pre and postsynaptic
spikes, these have signiﬁcant implications for STDP at
low frequency. However, STDP at low frequency is not
the sole method for inducing synaptic plasticity, and in
some cases even STDP requires that the pairs of pre
and postspikes are delivered above a certain frequency
[22, 30]. Thus it is important to analyze the contribution
of spike delivery frequency ν, to the calcium concentra-
tion, in addition to the relative timing eﬀect. We analyze
the case in which both pre and postsynaptic neurons ﬁre
regularly at the same frequency ν, the onset of the post-
synaptic spike-train being shifted from the presynaptic
spike train by ∆t < 1/ν. Notice, however, that in the
most general case the number of presynaptic and postsy-
naptic spikes as well as their timing diﬀerences will vary.

Recall that the NMDA current in equation 3 is the
product between the fraction of openned channels f (t)
and the linearized Mg-block function
(V (t)) = a +
bV (t), where V (t) = VR + BPAP(t) omits depolariza-
tion due to the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EP-

SPs). For a sequence

Plots of these expressions are shown in FIG. 5. As
expected, the overall calcium is frequency and timing-
dependent. Higher frequency stimulations build up the
intracellular calcium concentration (FIG. 5a), in addition
to the ∆t-dependence shown in previous sections (FIG.

V. STOCHASTIC PROPERTIES OF CALCIUM
INFLUX

In previous sections we have calculated the mean cal-
cium transients under various conditions and assump-
tions. However, synaptic transmission is a random pro-
cess and the trial-by-trial calcium transients deviate from
the mean. One source of variability is the stochasticity
of the presynaptic neurotransmitter release. A failure
of release at a given synapse would result in eliminating
the postsynaptic calcium transient at that synapse. Al-
though this source of variability can be signiﬁcant, its
consequences are simple to predict, since the absence of
release will result in no synaptic plasticity in the speciﬁc
spine. Another source of variablity is the stochasticity of
the postsynaptic opening of NMDA channels. Because

In this section, we calculate the variability due to Z
NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic terminal. We as-
sume the following simple Markov model: the state vec-
tor Pn(t) denotes the probability of being in each one of
the n possible states and the transition matrix Rn rep-
resents transition probabilities from state to state. For a
Markov processes, the evolution equation has the form:

dPn

= RnPn,

with the solution:

Pn(t) = Pn(0) exp

where Pn(0) is the initial condition.

In the simplest model the process has only two states,

unbound u and open-bound o:

(28)

(26)

where G is the glutamate concentration, k1 and k−1 are
the forward and backward time constants respectively.

This model is clearly simpliﬁed since typically ﬁve state
models used to account for NMDAR kinetics. However,
it is suﬃcient for describing the single exponential de-
cay kinetics, we have assumed for the NMDAR above,
since during decay G = 0 (see equation 31, below). The

transition matrix for this model is:

R2 =

k1G k−1

k−1.

−

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(29)

where G is the neurotransmitter concentration. We as-
sume that G has a non-zero value for a limited amount
of time and then is zero. We are primarily interested in
the falling phase (G = 0) of the NMDAR current.

We denote by pu and po the probability of being in the
unbound and open states respectively. Since pu + po = 1
the diﬀerential equation for po reads:

˙po = k1G

po(k1G + k−1).

(30)

−

For a constant value of G the solution of this equation

is:

po(t) =

k1G
k1G + k−1

+ Ce

−(k1G+k−1)t.

(31)

where the constant C is determined by the initial condi-
tions.

During the falling phase (G = 0) the time constant
has the value τN = 1/k−1. The solution takes the form
po(t) = µe−t/τN, where µ can now be deﬁned more pre-
cisely as the open probability at the start of the falling
phase.

The total calcium current through Z identical NMDAR
is I(t) =
(V (t)), where g is the single channel
NMDAR conductance, and si = 1 when receptor in open
state 0 when in closed and unbound states. To simplify
the notation we can rewrite equation 7 as
= V0 +
tpost)e−(t−tpost)/τB, where V0 = a+bVR and V1 =
V1Θ(t

Expression 33 is similar to equation 2 since I(t) =
(t)po(t). We have calculated this integral in section
Zg
II for the diﬀerent cases (pre, pre-post, post-pre). These
assumptions are equivalent to the simple Markov model
assumed here.

We can use the Bayes rule to rewrite poo(t, t′) =
t′)po(t′). Thus there are two types of variables
poo(t
|
which we need to calculate from the Markov process,
po(t) and poo(t

The solution for po(t) is given by equation 31. We de-
ﬁne the time t = 0 as the beginning of the falling phase
(G = 0), or tpre = 0. Further, we assume an instanta-
neous rise time. So for t < 0, po(t) = 0 and at t = 0
po(0) = µ. Thus for t > 0 po(t) = µe−t/τN.

In appendix A we analytically calculate the form of
the terms α1, α2 and α3. Although the analytical form
is complex, the consequences are simple and signiﬁcant.
As expected, CVZ = CV1/√Z. Thus the variability is
signiﬁcant only at relatively low Z.

VI. DISCUSSION

Calcium transients due to NMDA currents are believed
to play a major role in many forms of synaptic plasticity.
We have recently shown that a model based on these
transients can account for various diﬀerent plasticity-
induction protocols [28]. In this paper, we compute ana-
lytically the calcium dynamics evoked by pairs of pre- and
postsynaptic spikes under diﬀerent conditions, so that
the physiological components of the ionic currents that
impact plasticity can be investigated.

We showed that the peak of the calcium transients de-
for ∆t > 0, the peak concentration
pends on the ∆t:
decays with the time constant τN of the NMDAR, and
for ∆t < 0, it decays with the time constant τB of the
BPAP. Therefore, τN and τB will determine he width of
the pre-post LTP and the post-pre LTD windows, re-
spectively. These results were conﬁrmed by simulations,
in which there approximations we made for the calcu-
lations were relaxed. The ∆t dependence of the peak
calcium transient is similar for the case in which we con-
sider a two-component BPAP: the diﬀerence lies in the
∆t < 0 case, which now depends on the combination
of the two time constants. The two-component BPAP
allows a sharper transition between the post-before-pre
and the pre-before-post STDP window. We also showed
that besides the timing of the pre and post-spikes, the
mean calcium transients depend on the frequency ν of
the pre and postsynaptic conditioning.

One of the predictions of the uniﬁed calcium model is
that there exists a pre-before-post LTD for values of ∆t
greater than the ones that elicit LTP [28]. This has been
shown experimentally by some investigators [24]; others
have only placed a small number of data points in this
region [5, 30]. In all published STDP experiments, there
is a large variability in the magnitude and the sign of
synaptic plasticity across the diﬀerent values of ∆t. It
would therefore be diﬃcult to assess the existence of this

11

type of LTD without a large amount of data. The vari-
ability encountered in the experiments indicates that it
should be important to examine the stochastic properties
of the calcium transients, in addition to their mean.

We calculated the variance of the calcium transients
and showed that for a small number Z of NMDARs, it
can be quite signiﬁcant. There are indications that the
number of NMDARs in the dendrite is indeed small (
≈
10) [25]. Further, we have shown that the CV increases
monotonically with ∆t, for ∆t > 0. These ﬂuctuations
can have signiﬁcant implications on the outcome of down
stream processes dependent on calcium, such as synaptic
plasticity.

Our interest in calcium stems from experimental evi-
dence which indicates that calcium is a key variable de-
termining the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity.
Previously several authors have simulated and analyzed
dynamical models of synaptic plasticity that can lead to
STDP [1, 15, 18, 27, 31]. These models typically by-
pass a detailed description of the physiology and bio-
chemistry underlying synaptic plasticity, such as the cal-
cium dynamics. Recently biophysical models, that are
dependent on calcium transients, have been published
[8, 14, 16, 28, 29]. In particular it has been shown that
various diﬀerent induction protocols can be accounted
for by such models [28]. In these models plasticity is a
highly non linear function of calcium. Therefore, ﬂuctu-
ations of calcium transients will not only add spread to
the resulting LTD and LTP, but will also shift their mean
(the mean of the solution is not equivalent to the solu-
tion given the mean calcium level). In the uniﬁed calcium
model [28], the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity
is determined by a saturated U-shaped function of cal-
cium concentration. When calcium falls below a thresh-
old θd, no plasticity occurs, when it falls between θd and
θp, θp > θd, LTD is induced, and for calcium above θp,
LTP is induced. Thus, in the LTD region, if the spread
θd, occasional LTP
of the calcium is of the order of θp −
can still happen. We showed an explicit example for the
cases of ∆t =
10 ms and ∆t = 60 ms, where the mean
peak calcium concentrations are similar, but the variabil-
ity for the latter is larger. If this mean calcium is in the
LTD range, it is likely that the observed phenomenon is
that the LTD is stronger and more robust for ∆t =
10
ms than for ∆t = 60 ms.

This work is based on several simplifying assumptions,
however due to it’s relative simplicity it produces a quali-
tative understanding of key features of calcium dynamics
that are crucial for the induction of synaptic plasticity.
Therfore, it brings us closer towards understanding of
both the rate-based and the spike time-dependent plas-
ticity induction protocols.

At rest (FIG. 9b), the linear approximation signiﬁ-

because this is where the linear ﬁt departs the most from

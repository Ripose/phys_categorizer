Abstract

Simultaneous estimates of the activity in the left and right auditory cortex
of ﬁve normal human subjects were extracted from Multichannel Magnetoen-
cephalography recordings. Left, right and binaural stimulation were used, in
separate runs, for each subject. The resulting time-series of left and right au-
ditory cortex activity were analysed using the concept of mutual information.
The analysis constitutes an objective method to address the nature of inter-
hemispheric correlations in response to auditory stimulations. The results
provide a clear evidence for the occurrence of such correlations mediated by a
direct information transport, with clear laterality eﬀects: as a rule, the con-
tralateral hemisphere leads by 10-20ms, as can be seen in the average signal.
The strength of the inter-hemispheric coupling, which cannot be extracted
from the average data, is found to be highly variable from subject to subject,
but remarkably stable for each subject.

I. INTRODUCTION

Two emergent properties of complex systems are collectivity and chaos. Both properties
are relevant for biological systems which some believe are balanced at the interface of col-
lectivity and chaos [1]. The brain itself has been described in these terms, particularly its
tendency to diversity and its ability of generating coherent patterns of activity, switching
continuously from one to another. These properties are also expected to be very useful for
describing how local cortical specialization is eﬃciently co-ordinated by functional global in-
tegration mechanisms [2]. Implicit in any such explanatory description is the brain’s activity
on various space and time scales.

A quantitative understanding of the hierarchy of the underlying structures, both in
space and in time, is of fundamental importance for a proper design of a uniﬁed theoretical
model (for some attempts in this direction see for instance ref. [3]) relating local neuronal
dynamics and global attributes of sensory processing. This, however, is an extremely diﬃcult
problem since the conscious human brain is never at rest; central control of body function
and regulation, ﬂeeting thoughts and feelings, ensure that even in the most relaxed state a
tapestry of regional activations is woven every instant. Even the simplest of acts engages
a multitude of areas in a way that varies even as the same task is repeated many times.
We have studied one of the simplest possible brain responses: the activity in the human
auditory cortex, elicited by the presentation of simple tones, delivered regularly to one or
both ears. Even in this very simple and artiﬁcial scenario animal [4] and human studies [5,6]
have shown that many diﬀerent areas are involved. Nevertheless, for this case the two
auditory areas are known to be active and prominent. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) [7]
is particularly appropriate in the present context, because activity from the auditory cortex
is readily identiﬁable from both the average MEG signal [8,9] and in single trials [10,11]

Furthermore, since the two auditory cortices are well separated on either side of the
head, the instrument at our disposal, with two separate probes each with 37 channels, was
ideal for mapping the magnetic signal: while one probe is sensing the signal over the left
auditory cortex the other is sensing the signal over the right auditory cortex. With optimal
sensor location, a very simple linear combinations of signals can be established to map the
activity in each auditory cortex.
In eﬀect we make from each 37 channel sensor array a
Virtual Sensor (VS) which registers the activity in the adjacent auditory cortex [11].

MEG is a completely non-invasive method of measuring the distribution and time de-
pendence of the magnetic ﬁeld outside the skull. Just like the more conventional Electroen-
cephalography (EEG) it allows to time-resolve neuronal activity on the scale of 1ms [12].
Its main advantage over scalp-EEG is that the skull and the scalp are transparent to the
magnetic ﬁeld and, therefore, an external measured magnetic ﬁeld is not distorted by radial
conductivity eﬀects. Furthermore, magnetic ﬁelds outside the skull are generated predom-
inantly by the currents tangential to the surface of the head. The cortical currents are
perpendicular to the surface of the cortex but almost 70% of the human cortex is folded
into ﬁssures which makes these currents eﬀectively tangential to the skull and, thus, acces-
sible to MEG. The above aspects of MEG make it particularly suitable for studying the
spatio-temporal characteristics of the brain dynamics (e.g. [13]). The details of the MEG
experiments used to generate the data analysed in this paper are presented in Section 2.

In MEG the response to a stimulus is represented by the time-series, one time-series for

2

each channel. We use the repetition of identical stimulus presentations (commonly refer to as
trials or epochs) to compute statistical measures of correlations or of complexity. We use the
mutual information (MI) [14], a concept related to entropy, to characterise the correlation
between the two time-series representing the left and right auditory cortex activity in a single
trial. An outline of the corresponding formalism, including a very useful generalization of
MI, is given in Section 3. This formalism is then used in Section 4 to study the long-range
cortical correlations induced by left-ear, right-ear and binaural auditory stimulations. The
paper ends with some concluding remarks.

II. DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENT

The measurement of the minute magnetic ﬁeld generated by the coherent activity of
many millions of neurons can be recorded almost routinely today, using super Quantum In-
terference Devices (SQUIDs) operating within shielded environment [7]. The most advanced
instruments today have well over 100 SQUIDs allowing for a fairly dense coverage of sensors
all round the head. In this work we will report a study performed with the twin MAGNES
system of Biomagnetic Technologies inc. (BTi) in San Diego. This system has two sep-
arate dewars each with 37 ﬁrst order gradiometers. During the experiment, the subject’s
head was resting on the bottom dewar, while the top dewar was placed over the opposite
temporal area. Five healthy male volunteers (age: 37.8±9.7) gave their informed consent
to participate in two experiments. Four subjects (JD, JL, FB and RB) were right handed,
two of them (FB and RB) were twins and one subject (DB) was left handed. The ﬁrst
experiment, was in two parts (Ex1a and Ex1b), with a second experiment, Ex2, performed
between Ex1a and Ex1b. The second experiment used similar auditory tones in a standard
GO/NOGO symmetric avoidance protocole. For the purpose of this study the details of Ex2
are not relevant, other than it was long and it involved auditory stimuli which determined
whether or not a movement was to be made or withheld. For more details see [11]. The
subject maintained the same position throughout Ex1 and Ex2, which was ﬁxed as follows:
A standard auditory evoked response was ﬁrst obtained from stimuli delivered to both ears.
This response is termed M100, it is the magnetic analogue of the N100, a peak in the EEG
signal corresponding to the crest of a negative potential [12]. The BTi software was used to
compute and display the average signal across 120 single trials, while the subject remained
in place. The inspection of the average signal was used to guide repositioning of the dewars
so that the prominent M100 peak was captured with the positive and negative ﬁelds evenly
covered by the sensors in each probe. The procedure was repeated until each dewar was well
positioned, usually in one to three placements. Two further runs were obtained with this
optimal dewar position with exactly the same protocol, but with the stimulus delivered ﬁrst
to the left and then to the right ear. The ﬁrst part of Ex1 (Ex1a) consisted of three runs:
the last dewar placement run with binaural stimuli and the two monaural stimulations. The
subject then underwent the more demanding and long Ex2. Immediately after Ex2, with
the subject still holding the same position, experiment Ex1 was repeated (for most subjects
the binaural tone presentation was omitted). For both the positioning runs and the 5 or 6
actual runs of Ex1, the stimuli were 50 msec, 1 kHz tone bursts at 50dB (10 msec rise/fall
and 30 msec plateau). The inter-stimulus interval was 1 second (± 20 msec). The MEG
signal was recorded in continuous mode, sampled at 1042 Hz and ﬁltered in real time with

3

0.1 Hz high pass. The analysis to be reported in this paper used two more signals obtained
by further band-pass ﬁltering in the 1-200 Hz (with notch ﬁlters at 50 Hz, 100 Hz and 150
Hz), and 3-20 Hz.

The biomagnetic inverse problem has no unique solution. This seemingly unsurmountable
obstacle becomes less formidable when physiological constraints are introduced and provided
the resolution demanded from the data is limited to what is achievable given the sparseness
of the sensors and the noise in the data. The extraction of reliable estimates is considerably
easier for superﬁcial generators, directly below a sensor array, i.e. the auditory cortex in our
case. The requirement to analyze single trials poses new problems. We have arrived at a
simple but very eﬃcient solution beginning with powerful, but computationally demanding
methods, and an analytic transformation of the signal, the “V3” [10]. Comprehensive tests
with computer generated data have shown that a virtual sensor (VS), can be designed to
respond preferentially to activations of superﬁcial focal source. This is similar to earlier work
using a template approach [10], but here it has been speciﬁcally developed in the context
of the 37 channel MAGNES system to obtain regions of interest rapidly. For the purposes
of our investigation a good V S for auditory cortex activation can be easily obtained from
each probe, provided the 37 channels on each side capture symmetrically the dipolar ﬁeld
distribution at the peak of the average signal. For each probe, we have identiﬁed the two
channels (k1 and k2), which produced the maximum diﬀerence at the time of the M100 peak,
and used them to deﬁne the composite VS,

where λ is the characteristic length (we have used λ = 0.02 m which is roughly the inter-
channel separation); the results do not depend critically on this value. Sj(t) is the MEG
signal at time t recorded by the jth channel, whose position vector is rj.

The coeﬃcients of the expansion are computed at the time of the M100 peak in the
average signal; these coeﬃcients are used unchanged for the analysis of all single trials.
The computation of V S is very fast and hence V S can be used to scan through all MEG
averaged or single trial signals very quickly. For the purpose of this present study the VS
output from each probe provides a good estimate of the activity in each auditory cortex.
We can therefore use the pair of time-series in each single trial to study the relationship
between the left and right cortex activity.

Fig. 1 summarises the setup (a), shows a typical set of MEG signals (b) and highlights

the area of strong sensitivity for the VS corresponding to this signal.

III. MUTUAL INFORMATION AND ITS GENERALIZED VERSION

In an experiment as described above the message about the subsystem s (brain area in
this case) behavior is transmitted across the channel of instruments and procedures, and as
a result, is represented by the time-series xs(tn). The subscript n indicates that experiment
determines xs at the discrete time points and thus induces a partition of the phase space of
s. This time-series maps out the probability p(j) that xs(tn) assumes value characteristic

4

for the jth element of the partition. The average amount of information gained from such
a measurement can be quantiﬁed in terms of the entropy

H(Xs) = − X

p(j) ln p(j),

j

where Xs denotes the whole set of possible messages and the associated probabilities
Pj p(j) = 1) for the subsystem s.
(

If two subsystems, s1 and s2 are measured simultaneously, as is the case here, then
the corresponding probability distributions are p(j1) and p(j2), and the most relevant one,
the joint distribution p(j1, j2). For the combined system, composed of s1 and s2, the joint
entropy H(Xs1, Xs2) has the form analogous to eq. 2. It is easy to verify that

H(Xs1, Xs2) ≤ H(Xs1) + H(Xs2)

and the equality holds only if s1 and s2 are statistically independent,
p(j1)p(j2). The quantity

i.e., p(j1, j2) =

I(Xs1, Xs2) = H(Xs1) + H(Xs2) − H(Xs1, Xs2)

thus evaluates the amount of information about one of the subsystems resulting from a mea-
surement of the other and is therefore called the mutual information. Generalization of this
concept to a larger number of subsystems is straightforward and is known as redundancy [15].
A question of fundamental interest, especially in the context described in the Intro-
duction, is whether the spatiotemporal correlations between the subsystems are caused by
spatial uniformity or by information transport. Information transport may lead to time-
delayed eﬀects in the synchronization of correlations. Such eﬀects can easily be quantiﬁed
by calculating the time-delayed mutual information between measurements of the two sub-
systems at diﬀerent times. The corresponding prescription retains of course the structure of
Eq. 4; only the time-series xs1(t) needs to be correlated with xs2(t + τ ). The mutual infor-
mation I(Xs1, Xs2; τ ) then becomes a function of the time-delay τ . It may display maximum
at a certain ﬁnite value of τ . This value of τ thus provides an estimate on the time needed
for the information to be transported from the subsystem s1 to s2.

There exists [16] an interesting generalization of the concept of the information entropy.

It reads:

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

Hq(Xs) =

1
1 − q

pq(j)

ln X

j

For q → 1 this equation yields the standard information entropy [Eq. 2]. The most
useful property of Hq(Xs) is that with increasing q a higher weight is given to the largest
components in the set {p(j)}. This proves very instructive in studying various aspects of the
phase-space exploration in dynamical systems [17]. Since normally the largest components
are likely to dominate the process of correlating the two subsystems it seems worthwhile
to introduce analogous generalization at the level of mutual information.
In fact, recent
literature [18] considers such a generalization but mostly for q = 2 and on a formal level,
without fully documenting its utility in practical terms.

5

By making use of the deﬁning equation 4, Hq(Xs) of Eq. 5, the corresponding generalized
joint entropy and allowing the time-delay τ between the time-series, after simple algebra one
obtains the following expression for the generalized mutual information:

Iq(Xs1, Xs2; τ ) =

1
1 − q

ln Pj1 pq(j1)

Pj2 pq(j2)
Pj1j2 pq(j1, j2; τ )

.

(6)

This equation constitutes a basis for numerical applications and its utility will be illustrated
in the next Section.

A reliable estimate of the entropy requires appropriately accurate sampling rate in order
to realistically determine the probability distribution p(j). For this one needs either a
suﬃciently long single time-series representing a phenomenon of interest or, as in the present
case of the relatively short time-series, one needs a suﬃciently large ensemble of such series.
When estimating Iq in the latter case one thus faces the two possibilities: (i) Iq is calculated
independently from each time-series and then averaged over an ensemble or (ii) the ensemble
averaged probability distribution is used in Eq. 6. Obviously, in general the two operations
are not equivalent for this simple reason that the logarithm and the sum do not commute.
It is quite natural to expect that the prescription (ii) is more appropriate as it results in a
smoother behavior already on the level of probability distributions, and thus the ﬁnal result
is to a lesser degree contaminated by artiﬁcial noisy ﬂuctuations. This statement can be
conﬁrmed by explicit numerical veriﬁcation.

From a general point of view one note of caution is also needed at this point regarding
Iq. For q > 1 it may happen that it assumes small negative values and the fact that
it reaches a zero value does not automatically mean that the subsystems are statistically
independent. An inverse implication still holds, however, as for q = 1: Subsystems which
are statistically independent lead to Iq = 0. Also, the positive value of Iq for any q means
that the subsystems are not independent. What in this connection is important for us is
that the above peculiarity of Iq for q > 1 may apply to the region of very weak correlations
only.

IV. RESULTS

Little can be extracted from a single pair of time-series. We need to consider the ensemble

of single trials. We ﬁrst establish the notation.

L(tn) and xα

From here on we will restrict our attention to the VS output computed as described
in Section 2. Each run is represented by two sets of the time series covering the 1s long
time-interval xα
R(tn) (n = 1, ..., 1042, corresponding to the left (L) and the right
(R) hemisphere, respectively. The sampling rate is 1042 Hz, so tn+1 − tn = 0.96ms). The
superscript α = 1, ..., 120 labels the single trials in each experiment. The time-series are
consistently centered such that the onset of the stimulus corresponds to n = 230. Fig. 2
shows three typical, randomly selected, single-trial raw time-series together with the average

xL,R(tn) =

1
N X
α

xα
L,R(tn)

(7)

over all N = 120 trials for the left (a) and right (b) hemisphere signals, for one subject (JD).

6

It is diﬃcult to identify the stimulus onset from the raw single-trial signal, although a
relationship between the peak of the average response can be seen in some of the single
trials. For a more detailed discussion about the relationship between the average signal
and the average see [10,11]. It is clear that the single trial activity is not dominated by
the stimulus. Since the background brain activity is not time-locked to the stimulus it is
averaged out after summing up a suﬃciently large number of identical trials. The average
over the full set of our 120 consecutive trials exhibits a pronounced M100 peak centered at
around 100ms after the stimulus onset. At the time of the M100 a number of generators
are active; our sensor positioning and the VS analysis in each hemisphere disentangles from
the MEG data the local collective neuronal response at the superﬁcial part of the auditory
cortex. Interestingly, even though the stimulus is applied asymmetrically (left ear) a similar
(but not identical) structure is detected on both hemispheres. This is consistent with the
known auditory pathways which are less seggregated on the contralateral side than in other
sensory modalities, namely the visual and somatosensory; an additional contribution may
arise from long-range interaction between the two cortical auditory areas, which are also
known to be heavily interconnected via the corpus callossum.

We ﬁrst explore the variation of mutual information between the two hemispheres both,
as a function of the time-delay τ and as a function of the frequency. The frequency spectrum
of the input data series xL,R(tn) is determined by their discrete Fourier transform as

XL,R(k) =

xL,R(tn) exp(2πink/N ),

(8)

N

X
n=1

XL,R(k) being the complex numbers (XL,R(k) = |XL,R(k)| exp(iη(k)). By inverting this
transformation in a reduced interval hK − ∆K/2, K + ∆K/2i of discrete frequencies k one
obtains the ﬁltered series xK,∆K

L,R (tn) spanning the frequency window ∆K centered at K:

xK,∆K
L,R (tn) =

1
∆K

K+∆K/2

X
k=K−∆K/2

XL,R(k) exp(−2πink/N ).

(9)

Determining a minimum value of ∆K which can safely be used in the present context
requires some care. The point is that its too small value may generate artiﬁcial correlations
in the mutual information of ﬁltered time-series. In an extreme limit, one frequency compo-
nents will always be correlated in some way. What preserves or washes out the correlations
in ﬁnite frequency windows is the relation among amplitudes of diﬀerent frequency compo-
nents. We determine a reasonable minimum value of ∆K, such that no artiﬁcial correlations
are induced, self-consistently: we make use of the surrogate time-series of the original ones.
The surrogates are obtained by randomizing the phases η(k) of XL,R(k) and making use of
Eq. 9. This operation preserves the power spectrum of the original series. By calculating
the mutual information of the so generated surrogates of xL(tn) and xR(tn) we ﬁnd ∆K
equivalent to 4 Hz as an appropriate minimum frequency window for our data. Below this
value some correlations may show up even on the level of surrogates.

Fig. 3 shows the landscape of the mutual information (q = 1) in the time-delay τ and in
the frequency window of 5 Hz centered at the value indicated. This is one of the experiments
on subject JD. The results of the other experiments for the same subject look similar.

7

When making use of Eq. 6, here, as well as in the whole following discussion, a grid of
10 bins covering an interval of variation of both, xα
L(tn + τ ) is introduced. This
guarantees stability of the results. For a given experiment the three diﬀerent probability
distributions entering Eq. 6 are evaluated by superimposing histograms corresponding to all
the time-series (α = 1, ..., 120) and then the logarithm is taken. As mentioned before, one
could also calculate MI for each α separately and then average over α but for the present
data such a procedure turns out highly unsatisfactory in terms of statistics; it results in a
much higher level of noisy background ﬂuctuations.

R(tn) and xα

The MI displayed in Fig. 3 is calculated from the whole 1s (n = 1, ..., 1042) time-interval.
Its speciﬁc τ dependence will be discussed in full detail later and Fig. 3 is basically supposed
to illustrate the frequency localization of signiﬁcant correlations. As it is clearly seen, such
correlations are mediated by the low-frequency (up to 20 Hz) activity. This picture turns
out to be subject independent. The amplitude of MI is found to depend from subject to
subject, however. For certain subjects the correlations are so week that they are hardly
identiﬁable on the level of q = 1 MI. For this reason we ﬁrst explore a possible advantage of
using the generalized MI as allowed by Eq. 6. According to the above frequency localization,
and in order to make the following study more transparent, all the time-series used will be
ﬁltered to the frequency window between 3 and 20Hz. Furthermore, since correlations are
mainly connected with appearance of the M100 peak, the time-series will be truncated to
the interval between i = 230 and i = 491. This covers 250ms starting exactly at the initial
moment of the stimulus.

The beneﬁt of using the higher q-MI is documented in Fig. 4. This ﬁgure illustrates the
q-dependence (q = 1, 2, 4, 6) of the generalized mutual information for the two examples: of
strong correlations (JD) and of weak correlations (FB). Clearly, the higher q-values oﬀer a
much more precise estimate of the time-delay τ at maximum. This originates from the fact
that increasing q gives a higher weight to larger components in the probability distribution
and this turns out especially important for the cases of weak correlations. For this reason a
summary of the results of all experiments, for all ﬁve subjects, as displayed in Fig. 5, is done
for q = 6. A convention used in the corresponding calculation when deﬁning the sign of the
time-delay τ between xL(tn) and xR(tn + τ ) is such that its negative value means that a
relevant excitation in the right hemisphere is time-advanced relative to the left hemisphere.
Of course, the opposite applies for positive sign.

Several conclusions are to be drawn from Fig. 5a. First of all, the correlations under
study are spatially nonuniform and the information transport between the hemispheres takes
about 10ms. The relative location of the peaks in MI indicates that, at least statistically,
the contralateral hemisphere drives the response for all the subjects and conditions studied.
This, however, in general can only be identiﬁed by a parallel analysis of the left versus right
ear stimulation (binaural is also helpful) of the same subject. The point is that for some
subjects there are certain asymmetry eﬀects. For instance, in JL the ipsilateral hemisphere
somewhat overtakes (∼ 5ms) when the right ear is stimulated but then the contralateral
hemisphere overtakes even more when the tone is delivered to the other ear, so that the
relative location of the peaks in MI, corresponding to the left and right ear stimulation,
respectively, is still preserved. This asymmetry in JL disappears in the experiment Ex1b,
however. A trace of asymmetry, but in opposite direction, is also visible in JD; again more
in Ex1a than in Ex1b. A likely explanation of those asymmetry eﬀects is that we are facing

8

a superposition of the two phenomena. One is a leading role of the contralateral hemisphere
when the tone is delivered to one ear (either left or right) and the other may originate from
certain subject speciﬁc asymmetry in properties of the left and right auditory areas. The
latter kind of asymmetry is known to occur quite frequently [12].

Figs. 5b and 5c illustrate the same quantities for the time-intervals just before the
stimulus onset (-230 – 0 ms) and soon after the M100 period (251 – 500 ms), respectively.
The picture changes signiﬁcantly. Except for JD the correlations essentially disappear.
JD seems to display certain permanent inter-hemispheric correlations but here they are
considerably weaker and always driven by the left hemisphere. This supports the claim that
the correlations under study are primarily associated with the stimulus.

Another interesting quantity is the strength of information transfer between the hemi-
spheres. This characteristics measured in terms of the MI-excess over background is largely
invariant for a given subject (similar for diﬀerent experiments).
It is, however, strongly
subject dependent and ranges between very pronounced (JD) and rather weak (FB, RB). A
related question that emerges in this connection is whether this eﬀect results from diﬀerent
strength of the coupling between the hemispheres or, whether this is due to the fact the
local M100 excitations diﬀer in their degree of collectivity. That the second possibility is
more likely to apply here can be concluded from Fig. 6 which shows the averaged (over
120 trials) MEG time-series for JD, DB, JL and FB (RB looks similar to FB). This ﬁgure
illustrates both, the left and the right hemisphere responses generated by the left, right and
binaural stimulations. The results shown also display left/right hemispheric asymmetry for
JD and JL, oriented consistently with the results of Fig. 5a. The magnitude of amplitude
of the so quantiﬁed response reﬂects a degree of neuronal synchrony developing the M100
complex in each case and this amplitude goes in parallel with the strength of the informa-
tion transport (Fig. 5a). This, in a sense, is natural since the amount of information to
be communicated results from the original local collectivity. It is also consistent with the
low-frequency origin of inter-hemispheric correlations as illustrated in Fig. 3. Localization in
frequency means higher synchrony and more determinism, and these, in general, constitute
preferential conditions for the long-range inter-hemispheric correlations to occur.

Such conclusion gets further support from the structure of the power spectrum (squared
modulus of the Fourier transform) of the time-series. These power spectra are calculated
from the original time-series xL,R(t) representing the whole speciﬁc experiment lasting 120s
and are shown in Fig. 7 for the two extreme cases, JD and FB, respectively. The cases
of stronger correlations (JD) are accompanied by the power spectra that have the lower-
frequency part signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed relative to the cases of weak correlations (FB, RB).
The opposite applies to the high-frequency region. The weak correlations are thus connected
with a more noisy dynamics which acts destructively on local coherence and, consequently,
on long-range correlations.
It is however interesting to notice that even in this case the
power spectrum is not completely ﬂat as for the white noise phenomena but shows a nice
”1/f ”-type (straight line of ﬁnite negative slope in the log-log scale) behavior [19]. For
JD this behavior is not that nice but the deviation seems to be largely attributable to the
permanent activity at 8 Hz (α-rhythm), consistent with the previous discussion. In fact, this
kind of power-spectrum one may anticipate already by looking at the M100 waveform seen
in the average signal (Fig. 6) and taking into account its functional similarity to the QRS
complex of the electrocardiogram. This complex develops the inverse power-law spectrum

9

which some interpret in terms of the fractal character of the cardiac His-Purkinje conduction
system [20]. In the present context this perhaps signals that the evolution of the M100 may
be governed by a phenomenon of self-organized criticality [21] which is a more catastrophic
form of collectivity and is generated by a fractal (scale-invariant) ’avalanche’-like process.
Interestingly, a new class of neural networks based on adaptive performance networks [22]
shows exactly this type of power spectra.
It also allows some local deviations from this
behavior and those deviations result from certain subject speciﬁc stronger activity at some
frequency. This model involving the elements of self-organized criticality can be trained [23]
to react ’intelligently’ to external sensory signals.

Of course, because of a strong permanent brain’s activity, it is much more diﬃcult to
precisely disentangle from the background a contribution to the MEG power spectrum of
a speciﬁc structure such as M100. Therefore, the discussion related to Fig. 7 can only be
treated as an indication that the M100 complex may itself obey an inverse power-law. On
the level of average time-series (Fig. 6) it can also be veriﬁed that it does although the
statistics is then poorer. The related questions are, however, not the central issue of the
present paper and will be the subject of our independent, more systematic, future study,
both on the experimental as well as on the theoretical level.

L(t) and xα+∆

Finally, on a way towards understanding the mechanism of inter-hemispheric correla-
tions, it is instructive to look at MI between xα
(t) for ∆ 6= 0. Fig. 8 shows
that, surprisingly, such correlations are much weaker for both subjects (as well as for all
remaining). This result indicates that what actually correlates the opposite hemispheres in
the present context is not just an independent appearance of M100 in both hemispheres but
the real inter-hemispheric information transport which projects one M100 into another and
thus induces certain similarity between them. They are thus functionally related and this is
what the mutual information reﬂects. On the other hand the speciﬁc evolution of M100 with
respect to consecutive trials must involve nondeterministic elements which make the above,
translated correlations much weaker. This means that only the global aspects of M100 are
time-locked to the stimulus; a detailed ’microscopic’ evolution turns out largely stochastic.
In fact, such a picture is again consistent with the phenomenon of self-organized criticality.
Besides the inter-hemispheric information transport discussed above there potentially
exists another mechanism capable of introducing a time delay in the mutual information,
namely a common driver which independently activates each path at separate times. Such
a mechanism does not, however, seem to be able to explain such a signiﬁcant change of
correlations as shown in Fig. 8.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The present study provides a clear quantitative evidence for two levels of dynamical
cooperation in the brain auditory processing. One is the local hemispheric collective re-
sponse, reaching its maximum at about 100ms (M100) after a stimulus onset. An interesting
emerging aspect of this excitation is that its only global characteristics are time-locked to
a stimulus. The underlying neuronal degrees of freedom involved are likely to signiﬁcantly
diﬀer from trial to trial and a possible scenario potentially able to reconcile these two as-
pects is self-organized criticality. In fact, the structure of the corresponding power spectra
is consistent with such a scenario. It also goes in parallel with our recent suggestion that

10

the single trial activity induced in the auditory cortex by a simple tone cannot be treated
as a deterministic response emerging from a noisy background [10,11]. The second level
of cooperation is the communication between the two hemispheres. The most conclusive
in this connection are the monaural stimulations. The analysis then shows that, at least
statistically, the contralateral hemisphere systematically leads by 10-20ms. The mechanism
of this communication carries the signature of (delayed) synchronization and thus can be
hypothesised as a direct information transport between the hemispheres.

An independent conclusion to be drawn from our study is that the mutual information
(MI) and, especially, its generalization, provides a useful and statistically appropriate for-
malism for studying the temporal aspects of correlations in complex dynamical systems,
even if, as here, such systems are represented by relatively short time-series.

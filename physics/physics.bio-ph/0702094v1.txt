Abstract

Multisite protein modiﬁcation is a ubiquitous mechanism utilized by cells to control protein

functions. We have recently proposed a dynamical description of multisite protein modiﬁcation

which embodies all the essential features of the process (E. Milotti, A. Del Fabbro, C. Dalla

Pellegrina, and R. Chignola, Physica A, in press), and we have used this model to analyze the

stability and the time-scales of this mechanism. The same model can be used to understand

how the system responds to stimuli: here we show that it displays frequency-dependent dynamical

hysteresis. This behavior closely parallels – with the due diﬀerences – what is observed in magnetic

systems. By selecting model parameters that span the known biological ranges, we ﬁnd that the

frequency-dependent features cover the band of the observed oscillations of molecular intracellular

signals, and this suggests that this mechanism may have an important role in cellular information

processing.

Multisite protein phosphorylation, nitrosylation, methylation, etc., are very common

mechanisms in cells, which use these processes to control protein functions [1], and thus

the ﬂow of information in biochemical networks. We have recently introduced a dynamical

model of multisite protein modiﬁcation which describes many properties of these ubiquitous

mechanisms [2]. The basic idea is that a molecule B can dock to anyone of several sites

on protein A: this produces structural changes in the protein, and eventually, when enough

sites are occupied by B, the protein undergoes a conformational switch which modiﬁes its

chemical activity or causes the release of some other substance. In this way it is possible

to model threshold processes in cells, and the thresholds turn out to be stable and tunable

over many orders of magnitude. This mechanism is actually quite complex and in [2] we use

simplifying assumptions that lead to the following diﬀerential system for the concentrations:

= −Nk+[A0][B] + k−[A1]

d[A0]
dt

d[An]
dt

d[AN ]
dt

. . .

. . .

= −nk−[An] − (N − n)k+[An][B]

+(N − n + 1)k+[An−1][B] + (n + 1)k−[An+1]

= −Nk−[AN ] + k+[AN −1][B]

(1)

where the states An are the forms of A with exactly n modiﬁed sites out of a total of N

sites, and k+ and k− are the on-oﬀ rates. This is a non-dissipative diﬀerential system, and

in [2] we have studied its dynamical properties, we have extended it to include the modiﬁed

form of A produced by threshold crossing, and ﬁnally found that the bimolecular attach-

ment/detachment process produces a dynamics that is the same as the classical allosteric

eﬀect. In this paper we return to the unmodiﬁed system (1), and turn our attention to other

features of the process.

lowing conservation equation also holds:

In [2] we assumed that the concentration of B behaves quasi-statically, so that the fol-

n[An] + [B] = [B]0

(2)

where [B]0 is the total concentration of B. Equation (2) means that B can either be found

free in the solution or bound to A, and that each An counts n times as much, because n

molecules B are bound to it. However equation (2) is not adequate to describe a situation

in which B is driven by an external process. At ﬁrst sight it may seem that the diﬀerential

equation

d[B]

= −

n

[An]
dt

+

d[B]0
dt

N

n=1
X

where d[B]0/dt is a driving term, solves the problem. However this is not so, because this

equation can easily push [B] towards unphysical negative values. The problem is that B

is partly bound to A, and one might drive the total amount of B down to small values so

fast that the bound B does not have the time to unbind. Biology provides an easy way out:

the concentration of many proteins is commonly modulated by the interplay of production

and destruction; production is triggered by genetic expression, while destruction may be

activated by the expression of a molecule that ﬁnally leads to the ubiquitination of the

target protein, and its degradation by proteasomes. It is easy to see that if the ubiquitination

process followed by proteasome action is fast enough, the details of the destruction process

can be neglected, and the change of [B] due to simultaneous production (P) and destruction

(D) can be described by the equation

where vB(t) is the production rate and kU is the decay (destruction) constant associated to

ubiquitination. When we revise (3) to include (4), we ﬁnd

+ vB − kU [B]

vB(t) = vB,0 [1 + m sin (2πνt)]

Here we use the production rate vB(t) as the driving term that modulates the concentration

of B: we let vB(t) change periodically

where m is the modulation index and ν is the modulation frequency of the production

process. This modulation only roughly approximates the actual biological ups and downs

in enzyme production, but has the obvious advantage that the diﬀerential system is excited

by a single Fourier component, and thus the nonlinearities that are observed in the response

are unambiguous properties of the diﬀerential system. The diﬀerential system cannot be

solved analytically, and we have to resort to numerical integration methods, and explore

the parameter space as well as we can. On the whole there are eight parameters, i.e., the

total number of modiﬁcation sites N, the total amount of protein A, the on-oﬀ rates k+ and

k−, the production rate vB,0 along with the modulation index m and frequency ν, and the

decay rate kU . At ﬁrst sight the exploration of such a large parameter space might seem

to be a daunting task, but fortunately we can limit ourselves to the restricted ranges of

the actual biological systems, and we use as starting points some of the values associated

with the multisite phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (as in [2, 3]), i.e.,
n=1[An] = 10µM, k− = 1 Hz, k+ = 106 Hz M−1. Using reasonable
values for ubiquitin concentration and for the forward rate in the Michaelis-Menten reaction

N = 16, [A]0 =

N

P

for ubiquitination, we ﬁnd that kU is in the range 1-10000 Hz. From equation (5) we see

that under stationary conditions, vB = kU [B], and since we know [3] that B has a critical

breakpoint at [B] = N[A]0, we take vB in the range (0, 2NkU [A]0). The modulation index

m can only range from 0 to 1, and here we take the full amplitude m = 1. Finally, from

our previous knowledge of the eigenvalue distribution for the linearized system studied in

[2], we know that the relaxation times in the multisite phosphorylation of the Rb protein

are approximately in the range 1 ms – 100 s, and therefore – after we have ﬁxed all the

other parameters – we sweep this range with uniform logarithmic spacing. In the simpliﬁed

situation that we have chosen to highlight the dynamical properties of multisite modiﬁcation,

it is natural to monitor the average number of modiﬁed sites hni =

N
n=1 n[An]/[A]0; using

equation (6) we see that the the static concentration of B should be

P

and correspondingly, we expect to ﬁnd the average number of modiﬁed sites [2]:

[1 + m sin (2πνt)]

hnieq =

N(k+/k−)[B]eq
1 + (k+/k−)[B]eq

Figure 1 shows that this expectation is fulﬁlled only at very low frequencies: for frequencies

higher than a few mHz, the curve (8) opens up into a loop that is reminiscent of the hysteresis

loop in magnetic systems. Here the loop cannot be symmetric about the origin, because

both concentration and the average number of modiﬁed sites are bound to be non-negative,

however, just like in magnetic systems [4] the loop shape changes and at the same time

the centroid of the loop migrates to a diﬀerent position at high frequency. We can deﬁne a

4

dynamic order parameter Q as in [4]:

Q =

hnidt

T

I
which is just hni averaged over the hysteresis loop, however here it is also useful to consider

the vertical range R = hnimax − hnimin. Figures 2 and ﬁgure 3 show the loop area, the order

parameter Q, and the vertical range R vs. frequency, for the standard choice of parameters

listed above. Figure 2 shows that the area behaves roughly as a log-normal function, and

therefore the high-frequency tail has an approximate power-law dependence [5]. This kind

of behavior does not change appreciably when the other adjustable parameters are varied

as explained above. The loop area in magnetic systems in known to follow a scaling law [4]:

here we ﬁnd that the loop area obeys the approximate scaling law

where the coeﬃcients C, ν0, σ0 depend on the speciﬁc simulation parameters, and therefore

the tail of the distribution has an approximate 1/ν dependence. The coeﬃcients also seem

to follow simple scaling laws that depend on vB,0:

The new coeﬃcients C0, vC, σC, a, b, w, d, e and r depend on the remaining system

parameters N, [A]0, k+, k−, and kU . Figure 4 shows the superposition of several plots

of rescaled loop area obtained in diﬀerent numerical integration runs: the superposition is

reasonably good, although more work shall be needed to obtain a better scaling law and to

ﬁx the association between C, ν0, σ0 and the simulation parameters.

The vertical range R in ﬁgure 3 shows that the system behaves as a low pass ﬁlter with an

extended transition region, and since this behavior emerges in a biological setting it is natural

to wonder whether it may have a deeper meaning. We conjecture that it could be used in

some biochemical circuits as a kind of slope ﬁlter, i.e., a low-pass ﬁlter used in frequency

modulation decoding that converts frequency modulation to amplitude modulation (see, e.g.,

[6]). Figure 5 shows the result of a calculation with a frequency-modulated B production

vB(t) = vB,0 {1 + sin [2πνCt + m sin (2πνM t)]}

(14)

where νC is a ﬁxed frequency, νM is the modulation frequency, and m is again a modu-

lation index. Although the system parameters have not been optimized for this purpose,

we see that indeed a frequency-modulated, ﬁxed-amplitude input produces an amplitude-

modulated output.

The importance of hysteresis in enzyme kinetics was ﬁrst stressed by C. Frieden almost

40 years ago [7]: here we have shown how dynamical hysteresis and related eﬀects arise

naturally in a ubiquitous biological mechanism, multisite protein modiﬁcation. Hysteresis

shows up in many biomolecular pathways, and it has been observed experimentally in reac-

tions that involve proteins with multiple phosphorylation sites, e.g., the phosphatase Cdc25

[8]. Phosphatase Cdc25 regulates cell division, and it is believed that hysteresis underlies

the irreversibility of the cell-cycle transition into and out of mitosis. We also note that

information stored in environmental molecules can propagate in the cell through the oscil-

lations of various types of intracellular molecules (such as c-AMP, ATP, NADPH, Ca2+)

and that various important cell functions (e.g., insulin secretion, immune cell activation,

neuron transmission, gene expression, etc.) are activated by the frequency decoding of this

information. The Ca2+ oscillations are a paradigmatic instance, and several intracellular

proteins/enzymes can bind Ca2+ at multiple sites and act as frequency decoders [9]. One

of these is CaM Kinase II whose enzymatic activity has been experimentally shown to be

sensitive to the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations [10]. Most importantly, the observed periods

of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations range between a few seconds to minutes, and match quite

well the frequency range that we obtain with realistic system parameters (the transition in

ﬁgure 3 spans the range 0.01 Hz - 10 Hz).

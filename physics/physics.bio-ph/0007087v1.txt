The periodic swarming of bacteria is one of the simplest examples for pattern formation produced
by the self-organized collective behavior of a large number of organisms. In the spectacular colonies
of Proteus mirabilis (the most common species exhibiting this type of growth) a series of concentric
rings are developed as the bacteria multiply and swarm following a scenario periodically repeating
itself. We have developed a theoretical description for this process in order to get a deeper insight
into some of the typical processes governing the phenomena in systems of many interacting living
units.

Our approach is based on simple assumptions directly related to the latest experimental obser-
vations on colony formation under various conditions. The corresponding one-dimensional model
consists of two coupled diﬀerential equations investigated here both by numerical integrations and
by analysing the various expressions obtained from these equations using a few natural assump-
tions about the parameters of the model. We have determined the phase diagram corresponding
to systems exhibiting periodic swarming and discuss in detail how the various stages of the colony
development can be interpreted in our framework. We point out that all of our theoretical results
are in excellent agreement with the complete set of available observations. Thus, the present study
represents one of the few examples, where self-organized biological pattern formation is understood
within a relatively simpe theoretical approach leading to results and predictions fully compatible
with experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

To gain an insight into the development and dynamics
of various multicellular assemblies, we must understand
how cellular interactions build up the structure and re-
sult in certain functions at the macroscopic, multicellular
level. Microorganism colonies are one of the simplest sys-
tems consisting of many interacting cells and exhibiting
a non-trivial macroscopic behavior. Therefore, a num-
ber of recent studies have focussed on experimental and
theoretical aspects of colony formation and the related
collective behavior of microorganisms [1,2].

The swarming cycles exhibited by many bacterial
species, notably Proteus (P.) mirabilis, have been known
for over a century [3]. When Proteus cells are inoculated
on the surface of a suitable hard agar medium, they grow
as short “vegetative” rods. After a certain time, however,
cells start to diﬀerentiate at the colony margin into long
“swarmer” cells possessing up to 50 times more ﬂagella
per unit cell surface area. These swarmer cells migrate
rapidly away from the colony until they stop and revert
by a series of cell ﬁssions into the vegetative cell form,
in a process termed consolidation. The resulting vegeta-
tive cells grow normally for a time then swarmer cell dif-
ferentiation is initiated in the outermost zone (terrace),
and the process continues in periodic cycles resulting in a
colony with concentric zonation depicted in Fig 1. Sim-

ilar cyclic behavior has been observed in an increasing
number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive genera in-
cluding Proteus, Vibrio, Serratia, Bacillus and Clostrid-
ium (for reviews see [4–6]).

The reproducibility and regularity of swarming cycles
together with the ﬁnding that its occurrence is not lim-
ited to a single species suggest that periodic swarm-
ing phenomena can be understood and quantitatively
explained on the basis of mathematical models.
In
this manuscript we ﬁrst give an overview of the rele-
vant experimental ﬁndings related to the swarming of P.
mirabilis, then construct a simple model with two limit
densities. We then investigate the behavior of the model
as a function of the control parameters and compare it
to experimental results.

II. OVERVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS

a. Diﬀerentiation. As reviewed in [5,6], the diﬀeren-
tiation of vegetative cells is accompanied by speciﬁc bio-
chemical changes. Swarmer cells enhance the synthesis
of ﬂagellar proteins, extracellular polysaccharides, pro-
teases and virulence factors, while exhibit reduced over-
all protein and nucleic acid synthesis and oxygen uptake.
These ﬁndings may be explained by arguing that the pro-
duction and operation of ﬂagella is expensive and may
require the repression of non-essential biosynthetic path-

ways. The largely (10-30 fold) elongated swarmer cells
develop by a speciﬁc inhibition of cell ﬁssion which seems
not aﬀecting the doubling time of the cell mass or DNA.

FIG. 1. Typical Proteus mirabilis colony. It was grown on
the surface of a 2.0% agar substrate for two days. The inner
diameter of petri-dish is 8.8 cm. Gray shades are proportional
to the cell density: the cyclic modulation is apparent.

The diﬀerentiation process is initiated by a number
of external stimuli including speciﬁc signalling molecules
and physico-chemical parameters of the environment. As
an example for the latter, the viscosity of the surrounding
medium is presumably sensed by the hampered rotation
of the ﬂagella [7,8]. Neither the signal molecules that
initiate the diﬀerentiation nor the involved intracellular
signalling pathways are identiﬁed yet, but a correspond-
ing transmembrane receptor has been found recently [9].
The structure of this receptor, together with other ﬁnd-
ings reviewed in [6], suggest a ‘quorum sensing’ regula-
tory pathway [10] characteristic for many, cell density
dependent collective bacterial behaviors like sporulation,
luminescence, production of antibiotics or virulence fac-
tors [11].

b. Migration of swarmer cells.

It is well established
[5] that swarmer cell migration does not require exoge-
nous nutrient sources, since swarmer cells replated onto
media devoid of nutrients continue to migrate normally.
The ability of migration depends on the local swarmer
cell density as isolated single swarmer cells cannot move,
while a group of them can. It was also demonstrated [12]
that the mechanism by which bacteria swarm outwards
involved neither repulsive nor attractive chemotaxis. The
typical swimming velocity (i.e., in liquid environment)
of swarmer cells is ≈ 100mm/h [13] which is also their
maximal swarming speed and rate of colony expansion on
soft agar plates [5]. In the usual experimental conditions
for investigating swarming colony formation the front ad-
vances with a speed of 0.5−10 mm/h [14,9,15,13]. Unfor-

2

tunately, in these cases there is no information available
on the velocity of individual swarmer cells, but it must be
between the colony expansion speed and the swimming
velocity.

c. Consolidation. The molecular mechanisms of con-
solidation, i.e., the downregulation of the gene activity
responsible for swarming behavior [16] is even less known
than that of diﬀerentiation. If the swarming motility uti-
lizes intracellular energy reserves as has been suggested
[5], then swarmer cells must have a ﬁnite lifetime. In ad-
dition to the septation of swarmer cells taking place at
the outermost terrace, inside the colony the diﬀerentia-
tion process, i.e., the supply of fresh swarmer cells must
also be shut oﬀ. The cessation of swarmer cell production
does not seem to be due to severe nutrient depletion since
vegetative cells keep growing (although with decreasing
growth rate) well inside the colony for many hours after
the last swarmer cells were produced in that region [14].
d. Colony formation. The cycle time (total length of
the migration and consolidation periods) has been found
[14] to be rather stable (≈ 4h) for a wide range of nu-
trient and agar content of the medium. The size of the
terraces and the duration of the migration phases were
strongly inﬂuenced (up to an order of magnitude, and
up to a factor of 3, respectively) by the agar hardness.
The nutrient concentration did not have an observable
eﬀect on these quantities from 0.01% up to 1% glucose
concentrations. There was, however a remarkable posi-
tive correlation between the cycle time and the doubling
time (ranging from 0.7h up to 1.8h) of the cells.

Two interfacing colonies inoculated with a time dif-
ference of a few hours and therefore being in diﬀerent
phases of the migration-consolidation cycle, were found
to maintain their characteristic phases [14,15]. Thus, the
control of the swarming cycle must be suﬃciently local.
e. Cycle rescheduling. A few experiments investi-
gated the cell density dependence of the duration of qui-
escent growth (lag phase) prior to the ﬁrst migration
phase. These studies clearly revealed that vegetative
cells have to reach a threshold density to initiate swarm-
ing [14,15], in accord with the suggested quorum sensing
molecular pathway of the initiation of swarmer cell dif-
ferentiation.

Agar cutting experiments demonstrated that a cut in-
side the inner terraces does not inﬂuence the swarming
activity [15]. However, when the cut has been made just
behind the swarming front, the duration of the swarming
phase was shortened and consolidation was lengthened
by up to 40% [15].

Even more interestingly, mechanical mixing of the cell
populations before the expected beginning of consolida-
tion expands the duration of the swarming phase consid-
erably, by up to 50% [13]. This ﬁnding, together with
replica-printing experiments [13] demonstrates that at
the beginning of the consolidation phase still a large pool
of swarmer cells exists and seems to be “trapped” at the

rear of the outermost terrace.

III. THE MODEL

Taking into account the above described experimental
ﬁndings, here we construct a model which is capable of
explaining most of the observed features of colony expan-
sion through swarming cycles.
(i) The model is based on the vegetative and swarmer cell
population densities only, denoted by ρo and ρ∗, respec-
tively. These values are deﬁned on the basis of cell mass
instead of cell number, therefore one unit of swarmer cells
is transformed into one unit of vegetative cells during
consolidation.
(ii) Vegetative cells grow and divide with a constant rate
r0 ≈ 1h−1 [14,15]. This will later allow us to establish a
direct correspondence between cell density increase and
elapsed time.
(iii) Usually, swarmer cell diﬀerentiation is initiated when
the local density of the vegetative cells exceeds a thresh-
old value (ρo
min ≈ 10−2 cells/µm2 [14,15]). (Prior the
ﬁrst swarming phase experiments indicate the presence of
an extra time period tℓ which is probably associated with
the biochemical changes required to develop the ability
of the swarming transition. This eﬀect is present only at
the seeding of the colony, thus tℓ = 0 otherwise.) When
ρo = ρo
min at time t0, some of the vegetative cells en-
ter the diﬀerentiation process, modeled by introducing
a rate r. Since the biomass production rate is assumed
to be unchanged during the diﬀerentiation process, the
rate of producing new vegetative cells is r0 − r and the
diﬀerentiating cells elongate with the normal growth rate
r0.
(iv) The full development of swarmer cells, i.e., a typical
20-fold increase in length needs a time (td ≈ ln 20/r0 ≈
3h) comparable with, or even longer than the length of a
consolidation period, hence can not be neglected. There-
fore, the ﬁrst “real” swarmer cells, which are able to move
appear only at t0 + td.
(v) The production of swarmer cells is limited in time
and the length τ of the time interval during which vege-
tative cells can enter the diﬀerentiation process is another
phenomenological parameter of our model.

As we here focus on the periodicity of colony expan-
sion, we do not consider what happens in the densely
populated regions after t0 + τ . Speciﬁcally, in our model
any activity of the vegetative cells ceases in these parts
of the system.
(vi) Swarmer cells can migrate only if their density ex-
ceeds a threshold density ρ∗
min. Above that threshold,
swarmer cells are assumed to move randomly with a dif-
fusion constant D0. The ﬁnite lifetime of swarmer cells
is incorporated into the model through a constant rate
(r∗) decay.

3

Unfortunately there are no good estimates on these
parameters in the literature. According to recent exper-
imental observations [17], ρ∗
min is less than 10% of the
value of ρo prior the beginning of the swarming phase,
i.e., 0.1ρo
miner0td ≈ 10−2 cells/µm2. D0 may be esti-
mated as v2
0tp/2 with v0 being the typical speed of swarm-
ing cells and tp being the persistence time of their motion.
As v0 is approximately 30mm/h (see Sec II.b) and tp is in
the order of minutes, D0 is estimated to be in the order
of 10 mm2/h.

The above considerations lead to the following set of

equations

˙ρo(t) = r0ρo(t) + Γ(t) − Γ∗(t)
˙ρ∗(t) = −Γ(t) + Γ∗(t − td)er0td + ∇D(ρ∗)∇ρ∗

where the consolidation (Γ) and diﬀerentiation (Γ∗)
terms are given by

Γ = r∗ρ∗ and Γ∗ = r(ρo, t)ρo.

The dotted lines represent regulatory (threshold) eﬀects: The

determined by their local density. (b) Notations and typical
time courses of vegetative and swarmer cell densities prior

sity ρ (or ρo) grows with a constant rate r0. After reaching
the density threshold ρo
min, vegetative cells keep growing only
with a rate r0 − r, but the total density (ρ) of the vegetative
cells and the diﬀerentiating swarmer cells still grows with a
rate r0. After the time required for the full elongation of a
swarmer cell (when ρ reaches ρmin), ρ∗ becomes positive, and
for r∗ = 0 asymptotically would grow with a rate r.

In particular, neglecting correction

i.e., where primarily diﬀerentiation takes place, we can

ilar considerations for t0 < t < t0 + td, Eqs. (1) can be
written into a simple, not retarded form

with α = 10 providing a rather steep, but continuous
crossover.

ing ρmax to 2.0 then the periodicity is gradually lost and a
continuous expansion takes place (b).

If the Γ ≪ (r0 − r)ρ condition does not
hold in the [t0, t1] time interval, then ρmin must be also
treated as a dynamical variable. This case will not be
considered here. In the following we use ρ for the char-
acterization of vegetative cell density.

IV. RESULTS

A. Numerical method in 1D

The model deﬁned through Eqs. (5) has the following
seven parameters: the rates r0, r, r∗, threshold densities
ρmin, ρmax (or τ ), ρ∗
min and the diﬀusivity D0. How-
ever, this number can be reduced to four by casting the
equations in a dimensionless form using 1/r0 ≈ 1h as
time unit, ρmin ≈ 0.1 cells/µm2 as density unit and x0 =
pD0/r0 ≈ 3mm as the unit length. The resulting control

parameters are r/r0, r∗/r0, ρmax/ρmin = exp[(r0 − r)τ ]
and ρ∗
min/ρmin. To obtain continuous density proﬁles,
the step-function dependence of D on ρ∗ was replaced by

D(ρ∗) =

Representative examples for the time development of
the model are shown in Fig. 3. The production of
swarmer cells is localized, and determined by the density
proﬁle of vegetative cells at the end of migration peri-
ods. In this particular model ρ(x) is decreasing towards
the colony edge, therefore in the migration phases the
source of swarmer cells is moving outwards. The front
of swarmer cells is expanding from the inside of the last
terrace. Because of the decay term Γ, cells become non-
motile ﬁrst at the colony edge.

B. Phase diagram

Each of the dimensionless control parameters can have
an important eﬀect on the dynamics of the system. As an
example, if the duration τ of swarmer cell production is
increased, then the consecutive swarming cycles are not
separated and a continuous expansion takes place with
damped oscillations (Fig. 3b). To map the behavior of
the system as a function of the control parameters, the
following procedure was applied. Migration periods were
identifed by requiring maxx ρ∗(x) > ρ∗
min. For a given
set of parameters we determined the lengths {ti} of the
consecutive migration periods, and the system was clas-
siﬁed as periodic if the three largest values of the set
{ti} were the same within 20%. Otherwise, the expan-
sion was classiﬁed as continuous as long as maxi{ti} was
large enough: comparable with the total duration of the
simulated expansion.

(8)

which quantity does not depend on the choice of position
x. As the insert demonstrates, for a given P , the actual
values of r or ρmax are irrelevant to this kind of classiﬁ-
cation in the parameter regime investigated. The general
structure of the phase diagram was found to be similar for
various values of r∗. For large enough P or low enough
ρ∗
min a continuous expansion takes place, while for too
small P or large ρ∗
min the expansion of the system is
ﬁnite. For intermediate values of these parameters an
oscillating growth develops exhibiting well distinguish-
able consolidation and migration phases. As the lifetime
of the swarmer cells is increased, the parameter regime,
in which periodic behavior is exhibited, is shrinked and
moved towards lower P values.

One can easily estimate the position of the boundary
of the non growing phase based on that (i) the width w
of the terraces is small (this assumption is justiﬁed later,
in Fig. 7.), thus (ii) the time required for the diﬀusive ex-
pansion of the swarmer cells is much shorter than their
lifetime, which, in turn, is (iii) shorter than the duration
of a swarming cycle: r∗/r0 ∼ 1. The amount of swarmer
cells produced in one period is P w. Neglecting the decay
during expansion, the width w′ of the next, new terrace
can be determined from the conservation of cell number

cumulative swarmer cell production density P and migration
threshold ρ∗

r∗. If the production is high or the motility threshold is low
enough then continuous expansion can be observed. On the
other hand, if the production is too low or the motility thresh-
old is too high then no expansion takes place. In an intermedi-
ate regime periodic growth can be observed. The boundaries
of this parameter regime are plotted for r∗/r0 = 1.0 (thick
continuous line), 0.4 (thick dashed line) and 0.1 (thick dot-
ted line). The thin continuous line represent an approximate
upper bound (10) for cyclic colony expansion. The insert
demonstrates that the fourth parameter of the model, r, is
for r∗/r0 = 1 and r/r0 = 0.01 (2), 0.3 (◦), 0.5
irrelevant:
(△) and various values of ρmax and ρ∗
min the type of colony
expansion was classiﬁed. Open symbols correspond to cyclic
growth, ﬁlled symbols to continuous growth while dots denote
no expansion. Note that the corresponding regions completely
overlap irrespectively of the value of r.

The behavior of the model is summarized in Fig. 4,
where the boundaries of the various regimes are plotted
for three diﬀerent values of r∗/r0. We found, that r and

The average length T of a full swarming cycle was cal-
culated by determining the position of the peak in the
0 ρ∗(x, t)dx, the time de-
pendence of the total number of swarmer cells in the
system. As Fig. 5 demonstrates, the dimensionless cycle
time values are widely spread between values of 3 and
12. However, T is only sensitive to changes in r0, r∗ and
ρ∗
min/ρmin, hence it does not depend on ρmax or τ .

the assumed parameter values characteristic of four diﬀerent
P. mirabilis strains.

The average expansion speed v and terrace size w were
also calculated in the parameter regime resulting oscilla-
tory expansion of the colony. First we determined the
time t1/3 when the system reached 1/3 of its maximal
simulated expansion Rmax = R(tmax), with R(t) be-
ing the position of the expanding colony edge and tmax
is the total duration of the simulation. The average
speed was then calculated for the time interval between
tmin = max(t1/3, tmax − 5T ) and tmax: for the last 5T
long time interval, or for the last 2/3rd of the total expan-
sion, depending on which was smaller. After obtaining
v as [Rmax − R(tmin)]/(tmax − tmin), the average ter-
race width was calculated as w = vT . Fig. 6. shows the
dependence of these parameters on the swarmer cell pro-
duction density P and migration density threshold ρ∗
min.
In general, decreasing ρ∗
min or increasing P results in an
increase in both w and v. As Fig. 7. demonstrates, for a
given r∗, the relevant parameter controlling w is P/ρ∗
min.
The results on the cycle time T (Fig. 5.) can be in-
terpreted as follows. As ρ∗
min is a good estimate on the
density of swarmer cells in the expanding front, at the
end of migration phase the vegetative cell density within
the new terrace is given by r∗ρ∗
minT ∗ with T ∗ being the
duration of the migration phase. Now the length of the
consolidation phase, T −T ∗, is determined by the require-
ment that ρ must reach ρmin:

Since the duration (TL) of the lag phase (the time pe-
riod before the ﬁrst migration phase) has been in the
focus of many recent experiments, now we turn our at-
tention towards this quantity. At least four processes
determine TL. First, there is a time tℓ associated with
the biochemical changes required to switch into swarm-
ing mode. As discussed in Sec.
II.a, these processes
take place only prior the ﬁrst swarming phase, and are
presumably related to sensing the altered environmen-
tal conditions. Second, the cell population must reach
the threshold density ρo
min (at time t0). Third, td time
is required to produce fully diﬀerentiated swarmer cells
(at time t1), and ﬁnally, the density of the swarmer cells
must reach the migration threshold ρ∗
min. Let us inves-
tigate how these parameters depend on the initial inocu-

7

As ρ grows with a rate r0 until the appearance of

swarmer cells,

r0t1 = max [tℓ + td, ln(ρmin/ρ0)] .

(13)

The time development of ρ∗ can be estimated by the in-
tegration of Eq.(5) with r∗ = 0 (i.e., assuming Γ ≪ Γ∗)
yielding

ρ∗(t + t1) =

r

r0 − r

ρ0er0t1 [e(r0−r)t − 1].

Therefore, t∗ = TL − t1 is given by

shows the above calculated r0TL vs ρ0 for
tℓ = 0. The increase in length of the swarmer cells was
assumed to be 20-fold, thus r0td = ln 20 ≈ 3, which value
can be seen for ρ0 ≫ ρmin. In the opposite limit, when
ρ0 ≪ ρmin, we have r0TL ≈ − ln ρ0 + const. These rela-
tions allow the determination of both r0 and r (using the
known value of ρmin/ρ∗
min) from the experimental data
on TL(ρ0).

E. Comparison with experiments

Most of the published experimental data are related to
the average period length, T and terrace size w. From
these parameters the average expansion speed can be cal-
culated as v = w/T , i.e., v is not an independent quan-
tity. As we could see in the previous paragraph, from the
density dependence of the lag phase the parameters r0,
tℓ + td and r can be estimated. Notice that this estimate
on r0 is in principle diﬀerent from the value obtained by
the usual methods based on densitometry in liquid cul-
tures. Technically, ρ∗
min could be also determined [14],
but such measurements are not published yet.

There are four Proteus strains studied systematically
in experiments: the PRM1, PRM2, BB2000 and BB2235
strains (see Table I). To extract the values of the model’s
parameters the following procedure was applied. (i) We
estimated r0 based on lag phase length measurements.
(ii) From the calculated r0T values the ρ∗
min/ρmin ratio
was estimated (assuming r∗/r0 = 1) based on Eq.(12),
see Fig. 5.
(14) and (15), by a non-
linear ﬁtting procedure (Levenberg-Marquardt method,
[18], see Fig. 8b.) ρmin, r, and tℓ + td was determined.
(The latter value is not relevant in respect the periodic-
ity of the behavior.) (iv) Knowing ρ∗
min and ρmin, from
the experimental terrace width data x0 and P can be
estimated using Fig. 6. (v) Finally, τ is given by

(iii) Using Eqs.

+ 1(cid:19)

(16)

The parameter values of the model are summarized in
Table II, together with the predictions on T , v and w.
An excellent agreement can be achieved with biologically
relevant parameter values.

Two classes of model parameters should be distin-
guished: (a) the ones which are related to the growth
and diﬀerentiation of the cells (r0, r∗, ρmin, and P (r, τ ))
and (b) those which depend on agar softness (D0 and
ρ∗
min). For a given strain we expect that a change in
the agar concentration inﬂuences only the latter group,
while changes in temperature may aﬀect both, but pri-
marily r0. In fact, as Table I. demonstrates, by changing
D0 and keeping all the other, growth-related parameters
constant, we could quantitatively reproduce the colony
behavior observed on various agar concentrations. Sim-
ilar statement holds for the temperature eﬀects as well,
where the only parameter we changed was the growth
rate r0.

V. DISCUSSION

Periodic bacterial growth patterns have been in the fo-
cus of research in the last few years. Since a colony can
be viewed as a system where diﬀusing nutrients are con-
verted into diﬀusing bacteria, one may not be surprised
by the emergence of spatial structures [19]. However, the
periodic patterns of bacterial colonies are qualitatively
diﬀerent from the Liesegang rings (for a recent review
see [20]) developing in reaction-diﬀusion systems:
the
spacing between the densely populated areas is uniform
and independent of the concentration of the other dif-
fusing species, i.e., the nutrients. The Turing instability
is also well-known for producing spatial structures [21],
but in that case the pattern emerges simultaneously in
the whole system.
It is also known, that bacteria can
aggregate in steady concentric ring structures as a con-
sequence of chemotactic interactions [22,23], but as we
discussed in Sec. II., it is established that swarming of
P. Mirabilis does not involve chemotaxis communication.
Therefore, none of the well known generic pattern form-
ing schemes can explain the colony structure of swarming
bacteria.

As we mentioned in the introduction, oscillatory
growth is also exhibited by other bacterial species. One
of them, Bacillus subtilis, has been the subject of system-
atic studies on colony formation and a number of models
have been constructed to explain the observed morphol-
ogy diagram (for recent reviews see [24,25]). Only one
model addressed the problem of migration and consolida-
tion phases: Mimura et al [26] set up a reaction-diﬀusion
system in which the decay rate of the bacteria was depen-
dent both on their concentration and the locally available
amount of nutrients. The periodic behavior is then a con-
sequence of the following cycle: if nutrients are used up

locally, then the bacterial density starts to decay pre-
venting the further expansion of the colony. Nutrients
diﬀuse to the colony and accumulate due to the reduced
consumption of the already decreased population. The
increased nutrient concentration gradually allows the in-
crease in population density and the expansion of the
colony, which starts the cycle from the beginning. While
this can be a sound explanation for B. subtilis, as we dis-
cussed in Sec. II., the nutrient limitation clearly can not
explain neither the diﬀerentiation nor the consolidation
of P. Mirabilis swarmer cells.

Another recent study [27] focused on the swarming of
Serratia liquefaciens.
In that case the structure of the
molecular feedback loops are better explored, and were
resolved in the model. The production of a wetting agent
was initiated by high concentrations of speciﬁc signalling
molecules. The colony expansion was considered to be a
direct consequence of the ﬂow of the wetting ﬂuid ﬁlm,
in which process the only eﬀect of bacteria (besides the
aforementioned production) was changing the eﬀective
viscosity of the ﬂuid. The wetting agent production was
downregulated through a negative feedback loop involv-
ing swarmer cell diﬀerentiation. This scenario is certainly
not applicable to P. Mirabilis, where swarmer cells ac-
tively migrate outwards and their role is quite the oppo-
site: enhancing the expansion of the colony.

The ﬁrst theoretical analysis focusing on P. mirabilis
was performed by Esipov and Shapiro (ES) in [28]. Their
model was constructed based on assumptions similar to
ours, and could reproduce the alternating migration and
consolidation phases during the colony expansion. How-
ever, the complexity of the ES model involves a rather
large number of model parameters, which practically im-
pedes both the full mapping of the parameter space and
the quantitative comparison of the model results with ex-
perimental ﬁndings. The major diﬀerences between our
and the ES model can be summarized as follows: (i) we
do not resolve the age of the swarmer population.
In-
stead, we have a density measure and a constant decay
rate implying an exponential lifetime distribution on the
(unresolved) level of individual cells. Since the available
microbiological observations [5,13] suggest only that the
lifetime is ﬁnite, there is no reason for preferring any
speciﬁc distribution.
(ii) We did not incorporate into
our model an unspeciﬁed “memory ﬁeld” with a built-in
hysteresis. Instead, we implemented a density-dependent
motility of the swarmer cells, which behavior has been
indeed observed [4–6]. (iii) In our model the fully diﬀer-
entiated swarmer cells do not grow, which assumption is
probably not fundamental for the reported behavior, but
it seems to be more realistic because of the repression of
many biosynthetic pathways [5]. Finally, (iv) we do not
consider any speciﬁc interaction between the motility of
swarmer cells and the non-motile vegetative cell popula-
tion. Although such interactions probably exist, they are
undocumented, and as we demonstrated, are not required

8

for the formation of periodic swarming cycles. However,
such eﬀects can be important in the actual determination
of the density proﬁles.

With these diﬀerences, which are not compromising
the biological relevance of the model, we were able to
map completely the phase diagram, establish approxi-
mate analytical formulas and estimate the value of all
model parameters in the case of four diﬀerent strains.
In addition, experimental data measured under various
conditions could be explained with one particular param-
eter setting in the case of the PRM1 strain indicating
the predictive power of our approach. Our model is a
minimal model in the sense that all of the explicitly con-
sidered eﬀects (thresholds, diﬀusion, etc.) were required
to produce the oscillatory behavior, thus, it can not be
simpliﬁed further. Such minimal models can serve as
a comparison baseline for later investigations of various
speciﬁc interactions.

The values of the microscopic parameters of the model
can be either measured directly (like r0, ρ∗
min, ρmin, ρmax
or r∗) or can be determined indirectly from experimen-
tal data (as ρo
min and r). Most of these measurements
have not yet been performed, we hope that our work will
motivate such experiments further examining the valid-
ity of our assumptions. In fact, one of the parameters,
r∗/r0 was set to 1 during the ﬁtting processes, as cur-
rently there is no available data to estimate its value.
Our numerical results suggest that it is probably larger
than 0.3, and it is unlikely to be larger than 2 (meaning
an average lifetime less than 30 minutes). Within this
range our qualitative conclusions are valid, while the nu-
merical values of the parameter estimates can change up
to a factor of 3.

The behavior of “precocious” swarming mutants re-
ported in [9] deserves special attention. First, we would
like to comment on the huge diﬀerence found in the value
of the transition rate r (see Table II). We emphasize that
this is not an arbitrary output of a multiparameter ﬁt-
ting process. First, we have reasons to believe, that the
motility thresholds of the two BB strains are rather sim-
ilar. Knowing the growth rates and the cycle times, Eq.
(12) shows us that the diﬀerence in the values of ρmin
can not exceed one order of magnitude. Assuming then
this maximal diﬀerence in ρmin, r remains the only free
variable in Eqs. (13)-(15), and the ﬁtting can be per-
formed unambigously. Thus, we are quite conﬁdent that
such a large diﬀerence exists in r showing that the rsbA
gene (in which these strains diﬀer) inﬂuences not only the
cell density threshold, but the rate of diﬀerentiation as
well. It is also interesting to note that in Fig. 8b the be-
havior of the PRM2 and PRM1 strains reﬂect a relation
very similar to that of the BB2000 and BB2235 strains.
Finally, our calculations predicted a slightly longer cycle
time for the precocious swarming mutant BB2235, which

is also in accord with the actual experimental ﬁndings
(see Fig 2. of [9]).

In our model the assumed functional

form of the
density-dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is some-
what diﬀerent from the most often considered one [24,26],
namely

D(ρ) ∼ ρk.

(17)

The advantage of (17) is that it allows analytic solutions
for certain cases [21], however, it describes an unlimited,
arbitrarily fast diﬀusion inside the colony where the den-
sity is high.
In contrast, in real colonies the diﬀusion
of cells is certainly bounded, and the expansion of the
boundary can be often limited by the supply of cells from
behind [14]. Therefore we believe that our thresholded
formulation (7) is a better approximation of what is tak-
ing place inside the real colonies.

Finally we would like to comment on the role of nu-
triens in the swarming behavior of P. mirabilis.
In
our model there is a phenomenological parameter (τ )
determining how long the swarmer cells are produced
at a given position in the colony. When investigating
the dependence of the cycle time on this parameter, as
Fig. 5 demonstrates, we found an extremely weak ef-
fect. Thus, at least within the framework of this model
there is no contradiction between the assumption that the
swarmer cell production ceases due to nutrient (or accu-
mulated waste) limitations, and the seemingly nutrient-
independent cyclic behavior.
In fact, this idea can be
developed further. By increasing τ (or decreasing the
motility threshold ρ∗
min) we arrive into a regime where
the migration/consolidation phases are not clearly sep-
arable as a motile swarmer cell population exists even
when the expansion of the colony is slower. Experiments
mapping the morphology diagram of P. mirabilis (Fig. 2
of [29]) showed that there are certain values of agar hard-
ness and nutrient concentration, for which the expansion
of the colony is still oscillating, but the periodic density
changes are smeared out due to the presence of motile
swarmer cells in the consolidation periods. If one asso-
ciates the increasing agar hardness with increasing ρ∗
min
and the nutrient concentration with τ then one can qual-
itatively reproduce those (i.e., the Pr and Ph) regions of
the morphology diagram.

It has been speculated that bubble formation of several base-pairs due to thermal ﬂuctuations
is indicatory for biological active sites. Recent evidence, based on experiments and molecular dy-
namics (MD) simulations using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model, seems to point in this direction.
However, suﬃciently large bubbles appear only seldom which makes an accurate calculation diﬃcult
even for minimal models. In this letter, we introduce a new method that is orders of magnitude
faster than MD. Using this method we are able to show that the present evidence is unsubstantiated.

Double stranded DNA (dsDNA) is not a static entity.
In solution, the bonds between bases on opposite strands
can break even at room temperature. This can happen
for entire regions of the dsDNA chain, which then form
bubbles of several base-pairs (bp). These phenomena are
important for biological processes such as replication and
transcription. The local opening of the DNA double he-
lix at the transcription start site (TSS) is a crucial step
for the transcription of the genetic code. This opening is
driven by proteins but the intrinsic ﬂuctuations of DNA
itself probably play an important role. The statistical
and dynamical properties of these denaturation bubbles
and their relation to biological functions have therefore
been subject of many experimental and theoretical stud-
ies. It is known that the denaturation process of ﬁnite
DNA chains is not simply determined by the fraction
of strong (GC) or weak (AT) base-pairs. The sequence
speciﬁc order is important. Special sequences can have
a high opening rate despite a high fraction of GC base
pairs [1]. For supercoiled DNA, it has been suggested
that these sequences are related to places known to be
important for initiating and regulating transcription [2].
For dsDNA, Choi et al found evidence that the formation
of bubbles is directly related the transcription sites [3].
In particular, their results indicated that the TSS could
be predicted on basis of the formation probabilities for
bubbles of ten or more base-pairs in absence of proteins.
Hence, the secret of the TSS is not in the protein that
reads the code, but really a characteristics of DNA as ex-
pressed by the statement: DNA directs its own transcrip-
tion [3]. In that work, S1 nuclease cleavage experiments
were compared with molecular dynamics (MD) simula-
tions on the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model [4, 5]
of DNA. The method used is not without limitations.
The S1 nuclease cleavage is related to opening, but many
other complicated factors are involved. Moreover, theo-
retical and computational studies have to rely on simpli-
ﬁed models and considerable computational power. As
the formation of large bubbles occurs only seldom in a
microscopic system, MD or Monte Carlo (MC) methods

suﬀer from demanding computational eﬀorts to obtain
suﬃcient accuracy. Nevertheless, the probability proﬁle
found for bubbles of ten and higher showed a striking
correlation with the experimental results yielding pro-
nounced peaks at the TSS [3]. Still, the signiﬁcant sta-
tistical uncertainties make this correlation questionable.
To make the assessment absolute, we would either need
extensively long simulation runs or a diﬀerent method
that is signiﬁcantly faster than MD.

In this letter, we introduce such a method for the cal-
culation of bubble statistics for ﬁrst neighbor interac-
tion models like the PBD. We applied it to the sequences
studied in Refs. [3] and, to validate the method and to
compare its eﬃciency, we repeated the MD simulations
with 100 times longer runs. The new method shows re-
sults consistent with MD but with a lot higher accuracy
than these considerably longer simulations. Armed with
this novel method, we make a full analysis of preferential
opening sites for bubbles of any length. This analysis
clearly shows that the previously published evidence is
unsubstantiated. We end with a discussion to address
the required theoretical and experimental advancements
that could address the title’s question deﬁnitely.

The PBD model reduces the myriad degrees of freedom
to an one-dimensional chain of eﬀective atom compounds
describing the relative base-pair separations yi from the
ground state positions. The total potential energy for
an N base-pair DNA chain is then given by V1(y1) +

The ﬁrst term Vi is the on site Morse potential describing
the hydrogen bond interaction between bases on oppo-
site strands. Di and ai determine the depth and width
of the Morse potential and are diﬀerent for the AT and
GC base-pair. The stacking potential W consist of a
harmonic and a nonlinear term. The second term was

later introduced [5] and mimics the eﬀect of decreasing
overlap between π electrons when one of two neighbor-
ing base move out of stack. As a result, the eﬀective
coupling constant of the stacking interaction drops from
K ′ = K(1 + ρ) down to K ′ = K. It is due to this term
that the observed sharp phase transition in denaturation
experiments can be reproduced. All interactions with
the solvent and the ions are eﬀectively included in the
force-ﬁeld. The constants K, ρ, α, DAT, DGC, aAT, aGC
were parameterized in Ref. [6] and tested on denatura-
tion curves of short heterogeneous DNA segments. These
examples show that, despite its simpliﬁed character, the
model is able to give a quantitative description of DNA.
Most importantly, it allows to study the statistical and
dynamical behavior of very long heterogeneous DNA se-
quences, which is impossible for any atomistic model.

Despite these successes, it is important to realize the
limitations of the model. The PBD model treats the
A and T bases and the G and C bases as identical ob-
jects. The stacking interaction is also independent of
the nature of the bases. Moreover, the one dimensional
character has its limitations.
In real denaturation ex-
periments, there exists an equilibrium between complete
denaturation and recombination. The latter involves a
complicated mechanism where two single stranded chains
in solution come together and match their complemen-
tary bases. As the PBD model basically represents a
single dsDNA in an inﬁnite solution, the probability for
the denaturated state tends to unity with increasing time
at any temperature. It is, therefore, only in the limit of
inﬁnite long chains that denaturation curves can be re-

convenient to decompose the contributions to an observ-
able into an internal and external part. The ﬁrst com-
prises the contributions of the dsDNA. The second in-
cludes all the contributions of the complete denaturated
molecules. Interestingly, experiments can even measure
these contributions separately in some cases [7]. In mi-

the opening threshold deﬁnition. Similarly, a conﬁgura-
tion is completely denaturated whenever yi > y0 for all
i. The internal part can be calculated within the PBD
framework. The external part, if needed, can be approxi-
mated using a phenomenological approach [6]. According
to one-dimensional random walk theory, the external part
vanishes for the inﬁnite chain. Moreover, for suﬃciently
long chains, it is reasonable to expect that the major ex-
perimental contributions at 300 K arise from the internal
conﬁgurations allowing to focus on the internal part only.
As a ﬁrst investigation, we performed MD simulations
of the short DNA sequences described in [3]. To restrict
the ensemble to dsDNA, we added the following bias po-

the point of complete denaturation. The addition of the
biasing potential is, in principle, required to have all mea-
sured statistical quantities well deﬁned independently to
the length of the simulation run. In practice, however,
all simulations at 300 K did not show complete denatu-
ration, but for higher temperatures the bias was found
to be really mandatory to generate meaningful results.
In total 100 simulations of 100 ns were performed using
diﬀerent friction constants γ in the Langevin MD sim-
ulations and 10 simulations of 1 µs using Nos´e-Hoover.
The results are discussed below together with the results
of the new method.

hibits direct numerical integration making MD and MC
far favorable. However, an increase of the computational
eﬀorts by a factor of two reduces the error by only a fac-
tor of √2 in MD and MC, while the reduction can be
quite dramatic in low dimensional systems using numeri-
cal integration. In the following, we show how to exploit
this by creating an eﬀective reduction of the dimensions
yielding an orders of magnitude faster algorithm for the
bubble statistics calculation. To explain the algorithm,
we need to deﬁne a set of functions

where θ(

reverse. These function indicate whether a base-pair is
open or closed. Using these, we deﬁne

which are 1 (0 otherwise) if and only if i is at the center of
a bubble that has exactly size m. To shorten the notation
we have dropped the yi dependencies. For even numbers
it is a bit arbitrary where to place the center, but we
deﬁned it as the base directly to the left of the midpoint
of the bubble. In order to have these quantities deﬁned
also near the ends of the chain, we use ¯θi = 1 for i = 0 and
i = N +1. The properties of interest are the probabilities
for bubbles of size m centered at base-pair i provided that

In agreement with
Refs. [3] we ﬁnd preferential opening probabilities at the
TSS site at +1 that vanishes after the mutation. Con-
trary to their results, we ﬁnd that the TSS is not at all
the most dominant opening site. Stronger opening sensi-
tivity is found at the -30 region. Also, diﬀerent from the
previous established ﬁndings, Fig. 1 shows that the muta-

match within the statistical errors and agreed with the in-
tegration method. We obtained relative errors around 10
% for Nos´e-Hoover and Langevin with γ = 10 and 5 ps−1.
The errors of the γ = 0.05 ps−1 used in Ref. [3] were con-
siderable larger due a stronger correlation between suc-
cessive timesteps. The principal error in the new method
is mainly due to the ﬁnite integration steps. To estimate
the accuracy, we compared ∆y = 0.1 and 0.05 with the
almost exact results of ∆y = 0.025. Using the TSS peak
of the AAVP5 sequence with free boundaries as reference,
we found that the systematic error drops from
5 % to
0.03 % for CPU times of 40 minutes and 3 hours only.
For comparison, the last accuracy would take about 200
years with MD on the same machine. The evaluation
of larger bubbles becomes increasingly more diﬃcult for
MD. Bubbles of size 20 showed statistical errors > 100 %
while these were only slightly increased for the integra-
tion method. Finally, we calculated the Pi probabilities

for the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) and a
control non promoter sequence (See Fig. 3). Also here,
our results violate the TSS conjecture. The TSS shows
some opening, but cannot be assigned on basis of bub-
ble proﬁle only. Surprisingly, even the control sequence
shows signiﬁcant opening probabilities.

To conclude, we have shown that MD (or MC) en-
counters diﬃculties to give a precise indication of prefer-
ential opening sites. In particular, information of large
bubbles is not easily accessible using standard methods.
The method presented here is orders of magnitude faster
than MD without imposing additional approximations.
The technique is not limited to the PBD model or to
bubble statistics only, but it works whenever the proper
factorization (5) can be applied. Using this method, we
showed that the TSS is generally not the most dominant
opening site for bubble formation. These results contra-
dict foregoing conjectures based on less accurate simula-
tion techniques. However, to address the title’s question,
deﬁnitely, there are still many issues to be solved. The
PBD model could and, probably, should be improved
to give a correct representation of the subtile sequence
speciﬁc properties of DNA. Base speciﬁc stacking inter-
action seems to give better agreement with some direct
experimental observations [8]. Also, the development of
new experimental techniques is highly desirable. There-
fore, bubbles in DNA and their biological consequences
remain a challenging subject for both theoreticians as
experimentalists.

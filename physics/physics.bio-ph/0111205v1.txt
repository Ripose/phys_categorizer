Random models of evolution are instrumental in extracting rates of microscopic evolutionary
mechanisms from empirical observations on genetic variation in genome sequences. In this context
it is necessary to know the statistical properties of empirical observables (such as the local homozy-
gosity for instance). Previous work relies on numerical results or assumes Gaussian approximations
for the corresponding distributions. In this paper we give an analytical derivation of the statistical
properties of the local homozygosity and other empirical observables assuming selective neutrality.
We ﬁnd that such distributions can be very non-Gaussian.

For more than thirty years, microscopic random mod-
els of genetic evolution have been the focus of a sub-
stantial research eﬀort in theoretical biology [1–4].
In
the future, such microscopic models and their statistical
analysis will be of yet increasing signiﬁcance in this ﬁeld:
the amount of accurate and comprehensive data on the
genetics of viruses, bacteria and especially the human
genome [5–7] has increased so considerably that it is now
possible to test microscopic models of genetic evolution.

Genetic information is encoded in the linear sequence
of nucleotides in DNA molecules; the four diﬀerent nu-
cleotides occurring in DNA are usually denoted by A, C,
G and T. A sequence of a few hundred or a few thousand
of these forms a gene, also referred to as a locus. Mu-
tations change individual nucleotides (e.g. from A to C)
and thus create modiﬁed versions of loci. The resulting
diﬀerent types of loci are also known as allelic types. Be-
cause loci consist of many nucleotides – each of which can
be changed by mutation independently from the others
– the number of possible allelic types is typically very
large. To a good approximation it can thus be assumed
that every mutation creates a new allelic type. This is
the deﬁning feature of the inﬁnite-alleles model [1].

Empirically, genetic variation is recorded by measuring
the frequencies ω(l)
a of each allelic type a at each locus
l. Genetic variation reﬂects the microscopic processes of
evolutionary dynamics. The simplest model of evolution
proceeds by sampling with replacement each generation
from the previous generation (at constant population size
N ). In addition, a number of microscopic processes take
place, each happening at a constant (but generally un-
known) rate. One such process is mutation, measured
as θ = 2N µ where µ is the probability of mutation per
locus per generation (in a haploid population). Another
such process is the exchange of genetic material between
individuals of a population measured as C = 2N c where
c is the probability of an exchange event per locus per
generation [8]. C is termed recombination rate.

The model of genetic evolution described here is called
the constant-rate neutral mutation process, referred to as

neutral process in the following. It is a stochastic model
and assumes that no selective forces act. The neutral
process is one of the most signiﬁcant microscopic models
of genetic evolution: not only does it provide a model
for genetic variation at loci unaﬀected by selection, devi-
ations between empirical observations and predictions of
this neutral process allow for a qualitative characterisa-
tion of selective eﬀects (see [9]).

There is by now an overwhelming amount of work,
both theoretical and empirical, on the neutral process for
the inﬁnite alleles model. A convenient way of simulat-
ing this process on a computer is to consider genealo-
gies of samples of a given population [10,3,11] in the
limit of N → ∞. Random samples are most eﬀectively
generated by creating random genealogies. In this way,
statistics of empirical observables may be obtained using
Monte-Carlo simulations. Another possibility is to sim-
ulate Ewen’s sampling formula [2] which determines the
statistics of the neutral process in the limit of large C.
Analytical work has mostly focused on calculating expec-
tation values and variances of empirical observables [12].
Distributions of even the simplest empirical observables
(such as the one-locus homozygosity [2]) are not known
analytically. The diﬃculty is: moments of empirical ob-
servables are usually calculated by expanding them into
a sum of identity coeﬃcients [12]. This procedure is im-
practical for high moments.

At the same time, the form of such distributions is of
great interest: for example, they characterise sample-to-
sample ﬂuctuations. More importantly, they can be used
to establish conﬁdence intervals for empirical observa-
tions. To date, such conﬁdence intervals have routinely
been obtained from Monte-Carlo calculations [13,14]. Al-
ternatively it has been assumed that the distributions are
well approximated by Gaussians [15].

The aim of this paper is to calculate distributions of
empirical observables (such as the homozygosity) in the
neutral process for the inﬁnite-alleles model. The remain-
der is organised as follows: ﬁrst the results for a single
locus are described, and then those for two and more loci.
Finally, implications of the results are discussed.

where the average is over random genealogies according
to the neutral process. The φk may be calculated nu-
merically in at least two ways: by generating random
genealogies [10,3,11] or by evaluating Ewen’s sampling
formula [16]. Obtaining an analytical estimate of the φk
is complicated by the fact that the allelic frequencies ωa
in (1) are not independently distributed. For instance,
they must satisfy the constraint

m
a=1 ωa = 1.

To obtain analytical results we seek an approximate
representation of the neutral process in terms of inde-
pendent
random numbers. When only one locus is of
interest, non-recombination models apply, irrespective of
how much gene exchange actually occurs.
In this case
the numbers ca of allelic types a with given frequency ωa
are approximately independently distributed [17], albeit
only for suﬃciently small ωa. Unfortunately this result
does not yield the statistics of F2 since all frequencies ωa
enter in (1), and not just the small ωa.

P

In the following we show how the distribution of F2 can
be determined by means of a recursion for the frequencies
ωa: assume that there are m allelic types with frequen-
cies ω1, ω2, . . . , ωm, obeying the normalisation condition
m
a=1 ωa = 1. Add one allelic type; the corresponding
a are deﬁned as follows: draw a fre-

frequencies ωa are distributed according to the neutral
process.

where a ≡ a(x, y) =

gence as x, y → 0. Eq. (7) is solved by expanding P (x)
in a suitable set of basis functions on the interval [0, 1],
resulting in an eigenvalue problem. Fig. 1 shows the re-
sulting distributions P (x) for four values of θ. Clearly
the statistics of F2 is very non-Gaussian.

The calculations summarised above are not only of in-
terest in the case of one locus, as the following paragraphs
show (in the following L denotes the number of loci).

Two loci. In the case of two loci (L = 2) on the same

In the limit of large C, the two genealogies for l = 1 and
l = 2 are essentially independent and the frequencies ω(l)
a
are well approximated by (3) for each l (and large n).
The distribution P (x) = Prob(F2 = x) is thus obtained
from the single-locus P (x) by convolution. The resulting
distribution is shown in Fig. 2. Empirically determined

recombination rates are often so large that this result for
P (x) is a good approximation:
in Fig. 2 two distribu-
tions of F2 are shown, for n = 100, θ = 1/2 and C = 1
and 10, obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations. One
observes good agreement with the prediction (shaded),
even for values of C as low as C = 1. It must be em-
phasised that the distribution is markedly non-Gaussian.
The wiggles in the Monte-Carlo results are statistically
signiﬁcant; they are a consequence of the ﬁnite sample
size (n = 100).

Many loci. When L ≫ 1, and in the limit of large C,
the distribution of F2 [as deﬁned in (9)] is Gaussian, and
its moments are obtained as

Discussion. In an empirical data set, n (and m) are
necessarily ﬁnite. It must then be asked: to which extent
are the za independently and identically distributed for
ﬁnite n (and m)? Fig. 3(a) shows za-values determined
from empirical data on C. jejuni [21], at the locus GltA
(n = 194 and m = 27), in comparison with the theory for
n = ∞. The empirical za are approximately identically
distributed, except at the edges where ﬁnite-size eﬀects
are observed (remember that z0 ≡ 1). Monte-Carlo sim-
ulations for n = 194 and m = 27 conﬁrm the eﬀect of
ﬁnite sample size. Fig. 3(b) is a similar plot with data
taken from one Monte-Carlo sample. The inset of Fig.
3(b) shows that that the za are indeed independently dis-
tributed. It can be concluded that the theory works well
in the present case.

In the remainder two implications of our results are dis-
cussed. First, in practice it is necessary to decide whether
empirically observed frequencies at a given locus are con-
sistent with the neutral process. The standard statistical
test (see [2] p. 263) uses the distribution of F2 as an
input (albeit with the number m of allelic types as a pa-
rameter and not θ as in the above equations). Since the
distribution of F2 was unknown, it was usually deter-
mined by Monte-Carlo simulations. Now, however, the
result (7,8) can be used: for m >∼ log n, eqs. (7,8) apply
independently of whether m or θ is taken as the param-
eter. The corresponding distributions are compared to
Monte-Carlo data [20] in Fig. 1. Shown are two cases:
m = 10, n = 50 and m = 10, n = 500. In both cases, the
agreement between our results and those of Monte-Carlo
simulations is very good.

Second, many recent empirical studies (see for in-
stance [13,14,22]) have analysed the extent of gene ex-
change. A common measure is the variance VD of the
number of pairwise diﬀerences at all loci under consid-

2 i (for the neutral process this
evaluates to to Lθ(4 + θ)/[(1 + θ)(2 + θ)(3 + θ)], see [12]).
However for ﬁnite values of C (linkage disequilibrium),
and especially for small C, the expected value of VD
is larger. The empirically determined value of VD can

be compared to a critical value obtained under the null
hypothesis that all loci are in linkage equilibrium. The
corresponding null distribution is usually obtained using
Monte-Carlo simulations [13,14].

In cases where the neutral model applies, the null
distribution of VD can be determined from eqs.
(5),
(7) and (8). Consider ﬁrst the case of large L, where
the null distribution is approximately Gaussian. Using

for large C, one obtains

This variance is always larger than the corresponding
quantity in a random shuﬄing scheme [13,14] because
the latter is conditioned on the homozygosity, and not
on θ. When L is small, the null distribution will be very
non-Gaussian, as the above results for the distribution of
F2 show. In Fig. 4, the null distribution of VD [as deter-
mined from (7,8)] is shown for the case of L = 4 and for
four values of θ. Note that the forms of the distributions
imply large, asymmetric conﬁdence intervals. Finally, for
m >∼ log n, the distributions in Fig. 4 are insensitive to
whether the process is conditioned on ﬁxed θ or ﬁxed k
[23].

Conclusions. We have shown that distribution func-
tions of empirical observables measuring genetic diver-
sity in selectively neutral populations may exhibit strong
non-Gaussian tails. We have found analytical approxima-
tions for these distributions, valid for large sample sizes
and in the limit where gene exchange is frequent; and
have discussed implications for the statistical analysis of

Abstract

Rotations of microscopic magnetic particles, magnetosomes, embedded into the cy-
toskeleton and subjected to the inﬂuence of an ac magnetic ﬁeld and thermal noise
are considered. Magnetosome dynamics is shown to comply with the conditions of
the stochastic resonance under not-too-tight constraints on the character of the parti-
cle’s fastening. The excursion of regular rotations attains the value of order of radian
that facilitates explaining the biological eﬀects of low-frequency weak magnetic ﬁelds
and geomagnetic ﬂuctuations. Such 1-rad rotations are eﬀectively controlled by slow
magnetic ﬁeld variations of the order of 200 nT.

There are many hypothetical mechanisms suggested to explain the biological eﬀects of
weak low-frequency magnetic ﬁelds. A brief review of the mechanisms may be found in [1]
and the detailed discussion in [2]. At the same time, the physical nature of these eﬀects
remains unclear. The basic problem is that the interaction energy of biologically active
molecules and the MF at the geomagnetic level is very small [3]. It is much smaller than
the energy of thermal ﬂuctuations κT

10−14 erg at physiological temperatures.

4

However, many organisms are well known to contain submicron magnetic particles. The
energy of their turn in a weak magnetic ﬁeld H is substantially greater than κT . For single-
domain magnetite particles of radius r = 10−5 cm or 100 nm in the geomagnetic ﬁeld the
energy µH
vJH equals approximately 24κT , where µ is the magnetic moment of the
particle, v and J are the volume and the saturation magnetization.

≈

The cytoplasm near cell membranes features such visco-elastic properties that the turning
of a microparticle may serve as a stimulus to cell division or ignite a nerve impulse. Magnetite
particles found in the brain tissues of animals and humans are of particular interest: this
constitutes one of the possible mechanisms of the weak MF eﬀect on the human organism
[4]. The nerve tissue of the brain is separated from the circulatory system by the blood-brain
barrier which is impermeable for most chemicals. In turn, the circulatory system is separated
from the digestive system. Therefore, relatively large ferro- or ferrimagnetic particles cannot
penetrate into brain tissue as a pollutant. They are found to have a biogenic origin, i.e.
they appear over time as a direct result of the crystallization in brain matter. Biogenic
magnetite particles are often called ‘magnetosomes’; they were ﬁrst discovered in bacteria
that displayed magnetotaxis [5].

The density of magnetosomes in the human brain is more than 5

106, and in meninges
more than 108 crystals per gram [6]. In fact, about 90% of the particles measured in this
study were 10–70 nm in size, and 10% were 90–200 nm. The particles were grouped into
ensembles of 50–100 crystals.

Given the fact that magnetic moment is in direct proportion to the particle’s volume,
it is easily seen that the inequality µH < κT is true for particles less than 30 nm in size.
Due to thermal disturbances, such particles can spontaneously switch their magnetic ﬂux
without turns, i.e. they are in a superparamagnetic state. The particles that are several
hundred nm and more in size go to multiple-domain states (the energy of domain walls is
less than that of the MF produced by a single-domain state): their remanent magnetization
may be ignored. These particles experience almost no torque in the magnetic ﬁelds under
consideration. In this article we consider the dynamics of an idealized ’mean’ particle, the
magnetosome with the radius r

100 nm in a single-domain state.

these changes exceed thermal ﬂuctuations
κT /2, they can cause a biological response.
∼
This sets a natural constraint on the MF magnitude capable of aﬀecting a biophysical or
biochemical system appreciably: h & 1–2 µT. However, for magnetosomes bound to an
oscillator system, eigenfrequency of which is close to the frequency of the external ﬁeld, the
biologically detectable level of the MF might be less. This may also take place in the special
case of magnetosomes bound to a visco-elastic medium: then thermal ﬂuctuations work to
facilitate rather than impede the capability of a weak magnetic stimulus to cause a response.
Oscillations of a protein macromolecule (dipole resonator) in a microwave EMF have
been studied in [7]. The dynamics of oscillating magnetic particles in the ELF MF has
not been studied in detail yet. Theoretical evaluations of the magnetoreception mechanism
based on magnetosome rotations in MF have been working out by many authors since 1970s
[8].

≈

In known works, the dynamics of magnetosomes was modelled by using the equation of
free rotations in a viscous liquid, since the elastic properties of structures to which magneto-
somes may be attached were not assessed. Quasi-elastic torque had been considered only in
relation to the magnetic moment energy in the constant geomagnetic ﬁeld. It turns out that
explicitly taking into account the elasticity of the medium enables one to describe a stochas-
tic rotational dynamics of magnetosomes that may be used to explain the particularities of
magnetoreception of weak and hyperweak MFs.

This article considers the dynamics of a magnetite particle embedded in the cytoskeleton.
The latter consists of a 3D net of protein ﬁbers of 6 to 25 nm in diameter that include
actin ﬁlaments, intermediate ﬁlaments, and microtubules. The ends of these ﬁbers may be
fastened to the membrane surface and to various cell organelles. We assume the ﬁbers may
also be fastened to a magnetosome surface normally covered with a bilayer lipid membrane
[9]. This ﬁxes the position of the magnetosome and constrains its rotation to some extent.
The stationary orientation of the magnetosome generally does not follow the constant MF
direction. The balance of the elastic and ‘magnetic’ torques determines the orientation
now. The torque m aﬀecting a particle of the magnetic moment µ in an MF H equals
m = µ
H. Here, putting aside the 3D character of the magnetosome rotations, we consider
the magnetosome’s motion in the plane of two vectors: the unit vector n of the x-axis, with
which the vector of magnetosome’s magnetic moment coincides in the absence of the MF
(equilibrium position, ϕ = 0), and the MF vector H. The Langevin equation for rotational
oscillations of the particle is as follows:

The idea of this work is to study the dynamics of a magnetosome ﬁxed into a visco-elastic
cytoskeleton and predominantly oriented in a direction opposite to that of a constant MF;
here the case ϕ0 = π is considered. The potential energy of a magnetosome in terms of µH

is shown in Fig. 1. As is seen, for not too large angles at a < 1 there are two stable
equilibrium positions ϕ± and the unstable one ϕ0 = 0. Within each of the wells of this
double-well potential, the motion of the magnetosome demonstrates no peculiarities. This
sort of motion has been repeatedly considered in literature. At the same time, due to thermal
disturbances, the transitions appear from well to well even with no ac MF signal. Given that,
the stochastic turns of the particle take place with considerable angular displacements. A
deterministic external force, the ac MF in our case, causes such transitions to be somewhat
ordered, the maximum order attained just at the optimal level of the noise. It is essentially

So far, the probable manifestation of the SR in the dynamics of magnetosomes has not

Several SR theories are known; we use the results of [11], where the general expression has
been derived for the power spectrum of oscillations of a bistable system agitated by regular
and random signals. The signal-to-noise ratio is determined as the ratio of the spectrum
amplitude at the frequency of the regular signal, to the level of noise at the same frequency.

attains its maximum at the optimal level of noise D = U0. This means there is an interval in
the value of D, where the signal-to-noise ratio unexpectedly increases along with increasing
noise power — it is this that is the signature of SR.

It is particularly evident for
50-nm particles, that almost all of them are in the SR conditions. 200-nm particles make
4.6 µT. Although in each of these cases there is
regular turns at relatively small MFs
no gain in the magnitude of the eﬀective ac MF as compared to the case of a single-well
motion, it is important that the rotation excursion is an order higher, about 1 rad. With
such excursions it is easier to account for the inﬂuence of the magnetosome’s rotations on
biochemical processes.

≈

Note that in an SR, the signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced because of the reduced co-
herence of the signal present in the spectrum of magnetosome oscillations as compared to
the coherence of the ac MF signal. Therefore MF signal detection requires a discrimination
system — probably, a nonlinear system of biochemical reactions with the characteristic time

∼

1/Ω — which can ‘make a decision’ as to whether a signal is present in noise.
It is of the essence, that this primary mechanism of magnetobiological eﬀects, displaying
no frequency selectivity in the ELF range, nevertheless allows one to verify it experimentally.
Since the parameter a = k/µH depends on the constant MF, the ‘resonance’ on Fig. 2 will
show itself also as a ‘window’ in constant MF values when the eﬀect is possible. Therefore,
provided the MF signal transduction to the biochemical level is governed by an SR with
magnetosomes of a certain size within limits of about 10–20%, it follows that the biological
k/aµ. Indeed,
eﬀect in the ac MF will take place only in a constant MF near the level H
when the MF decreases, the potential function transforms into a single-well one and large
rotational excursions are no longer possible. When the MF increases, the potential barrier
grows and the magnetosome ﬁnally remains within one of the two wells. This case also rules
out SR manifestation.

Apparently, for a portion of magnetosomes, large angular chaotic turns take place in
the absence of an ac MF also. If some biochemical reaction depends on these turns, it is

Furthermore, the reaction must be sensitive to small variations of the constant MF, since
the probability of transition W from well to well exponentially depends on the barrier height

All quantities here, including U0, are functions of the variable a = k/µH, and hence of H.
What is of interest is the relative value of the changes in this probability at small variations
of the constant MF, i.e., the quantity

.

Since the probability drops with the growth of the barrier height, we use ‘
’ to hold positive
values for the sensitivity S. Shown in Fig. 3 is the sensitivity S computed at several values
of the elasticity of the bond between a mean magnetosome and cytoskeleton. It is seen that
in a wide range of elasticities the sensitivity of the relative probability to MF variations
near Hgeo is equal to 10–20. This means a 1% MF change causes 10–20% changes in the
transition probability. Assuming 10% changes to be biologically signiﬁcant, we arrive at the
limit of detectable values of the constant MF variations
0.005Hgeo or 0.2 µT. This ﬁnding
generally does not rule out the possibility of a biological system containing magnetosomes
to react to slow geomagnetic ﬂuctuations.

Abstract

In this article, we have compared the metal-amino acid interactions in Tyr-Ag and Phe-Ag

complexes through pH dependent SERS measurements. By analyzing the variation in relative

intensities of SERS bands with the pH of the amino acid solution, we have obtained the orientation

and conformation of the amino acid molecules on the Ag surface. The results obtained from our

experimental studies are supported by the the energy minimized strucutres and the observed

charge distributions in diﬀerent terminals of the molecules. This, in a way, shows that SERS

measurements not only exhibit the interaction of the amino acid molecules with Ag clusters

but also demonstrate their orientation around it. We have addressed a long standing query on

whether the amine group is directly attached with Ag surface along with the carboxylate group

and π-electrons in these systems. In addition, pH dependent optical absorption and transmission

electron microscopy measurements have been performed to understand the required conditions

for the appearance of the SERS spectra in the light of the aggregation of metal particles and

the number of hot sites in the sol. Our results conﬁrm that the formation of hot sites in the sol

plays a direct role to form a stable Ag-ligand complex. Furthermore, the interaction kinetics of

metal-amino acid complexes have been analyzed via both Raman and absorption measurements.

INTRODUCTION

Spectroscopic studies of amino acids adsorbed on metal surfaces are important because

they can provide an insight into the nature of metal-biopolymer interactions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. A

number of articles have shown that amino acids with small side chains, for example, Glycine

(Gly), Alanine(Ala), interact with metal colloids through both the amine and carboxylate

terminals [2]. On the other hand, for Phenylalanine (Phe), Tyrosine (Tyr), Tryptophan

(Trp), Histidine (His), Leucine (Leu), Glutamic acid (Glu), and Aspartic acid ( Asp), the

adsorption occurs through the carboxylate group. However, no conclusion is drawn regarding

the amine- silver interaction [2, 3].

Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is an extremely sensitive technique for mon-

itoring the adsorption of species of very low concentration and for characterizing the struc-

ture and orientation of the adsorbed species on the rough metal surface [6]. Nonresonance

SERS is primarily sensitive to the species attached to the metal surface or present within a

few Angstroms of the metal-dielectric interface. Both electromagnetic ﬁeld and adsorbate-

surface chemical interactions are responsible for Raman signal enhancement. The ‘surface

selection rules’ and the SERS intensity of a particular Raman band determine the average

orientation of functional groups of the adsorbates on the metal surface [2]. In conjunction

with optical absorption measurements it has been shown that the single metal cation does

not exhibit any SERS eﬀect. Complexation with an organic substance is necessary for signal

enhancement [7]. The colloid activation by chemical treatment brings the primary metal

particles close together building up ‘hot sites’ that are SERS active in an electromagnetic

ﬁeld of visible wavelength.

‘Hot sites’ are located at interstitial positions between metal

particles and the number of such positions scale with the number of particles. In the second

step, the activating molecules of very low concentration are bound to the metal surface and

form the complex [7]. Despite well-documented limitations, the spectral ‘richness’ in SERS

arises not only from the inherent sensitivity of the process, but also from the ability of this

technique to determine the interactions in the metal-adsorbate complex and the relative

orientation and conformation of the adsorbed molecules on the metal surface.

The structural diﬀerence between Phe and Tyr is in the presence of only one -OH group

in the para position of the aromatic ring in the latter [Fig 1]. In solution, depending on the

pH values [pK1 = 2.58 and pK2= 9.24] the majority of Phe molecules assume the structural

2

forms shown as species I-III in Fig. 1 . Similarly, the structural forms of the majority of Tyr

molecules in solution with diﬀerent pH values [pK1 = 2.20, pK2 = 9.11 and pK3 = 10.07

(due to the side chain)] are shown as species I-IV in Fig. 1. In the sol, Ag particles are
in the ionic Ag+ state because of its low oxidation potential. The electrostatic interaction

between the above species of amino acid molecules with positively charged Ag particles in

solution, is responsible for the SERS eﬀect. However, the structure of the molecules also

plays an important role in determining the intensities of diﬀerent SERS bands. Thus, a pH

dependent study of SERS spectra with a comparison between the results for Phe and Tyr

is expected to determine the metal-amino acid interaction and orientation of the adsorbed

species on the metal surface.

The SERS spectra of Phe and Tyr adsorbed on Silver (Ag) colloids are available in the

literature [3, 8]. We ﬁnd that though the structure of these molecules are very similar (as

mentioned above), their SERS spectra are widely diﬀerent. To understand the interaction of

these amino acids with Ag colloids we have studied the pH dependent optical absorption and

SERS spectra of both Phe-Ag and Tyr-Ag complexes. From the relative change in intensities

of the vibrational bands in SERS spectra we have compared the interaction, conformation

and the orientation of these molecules on Ag particles. Section II covers the sample prepara-

tion techniques, which we have followed and other details regarding the instruments, which

we have used for various measurements.

In Section III, we have compared the possible

surface geometry of the adsorbed Phe and Tyr on the surface of the Ag particles via pH

dependent SERS measurements. Our conjecture from these experimental observations has

been further supported by the surface geometry expected from the electrostatic interaction
between Ag+ and Phe or Tyr, obtained from the estimated atomic charge distribution at

the diﬀerent terminals of the amino acid molecules. In this section we have also shown the

role of formation of hot sites to exhibit SERS spectra for metal-amino acid complex through

simultaneous pH dependent optical absorption and SERS measurements. The interaction

kinetics between the adsorbate and Ag colloids has been discussed in Section IV. Finally, in

Section V we have summarized our results with a few concluding remarks.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Silver nitrate (AgNO3), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and

hydrochloric acid (HCl) of analytical reagent grade (SRL, India), were used to prepare the

Ag sol. Amino acids were also obtained from the above company. A colloidal silver solution

was prepared in deionized water according to the method described by Creighton et al.
[9]. This method essentially uses the reduction of 10−3 M AgNO3 by an excess amount of
10−3 M NaBH4. 10−3 M AgNO3 was added dropwise to 10−3 M NaBH4 (placed in an ice

bath under quick stirring condition) maintaining a 1:3 volume ratio. Stirring for 20 minutes

was necessary to stabilize the colloidal solution. Later, it was left at room temperature for

approximately 1 hour. The excess NaBH4 evaporated and the remaining solution became
transparent yellow in color. 10−3 M solution of Phe and Tyr were prepared in deionized

water. The pH of the solution was adjusted by using 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH. For SERS

measurements Phe and Tyr solutions of diﬀerent pH were added to the Ag sol. For all SERS

experiments the volume ratio of Ag sol to amino acid solution was maintained at 9:1.

The SERS spectra were measured using a 488 nm Argon ion laser as an excitation source.

The spectrometer is equipped with 1200 g/mm holographic grating, a holographic super-

notch ﬁlter, and a Peltier cooled CCD detector. UV-Visible spectra were measured by

Spectrascan UV 2600 (Chemito). All absorption spectra are recorded 2 minutes after ad-

dition of the amino acid to the sol. Samples for Transmission Electron Microscopy were

deposited onto 300 mesh copper TEM grids coated with 50 nm carbon ﬁlms. The excess

water was allowed to evaporate in air. The grids were examined in JEOL 2010 microscope

with Ultra-High Resolution (UHR) microscope using a LaB6 ﬁlament operated at 200 kV.

The amino acid zwitterionic structures were drawn and energy minimized using SYBYL

6.92 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis USA). The structures were rendered in Pymol (Delano Scientiﬁc

LLR, USA). The atomic charge distribution of the molecules has been estimated using the

Gasteiger-H¨uckel method.

III. ADSORPTION OF PHENYLALANINE (PHE) AND TYROSINE (TYR) ON

SILVER COLLOIDAL SURFACE: OPTICAL ABSORPTION AND SERS MEA-

SUREMENTS

A. Phenylalanine (Phe) : Results and Discussion

The optical absorption spectra (OAS) of Phe at diﬀerent pH in a colloidal solution of

Ag are shown in Fig. 2. The Ag sol absorbs light at λmax = 392 nm (A) [Fig. 2]. This

band is associated with the dipolar surface plasmon of small, single, spherical particles of

Ag. Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of Ag sol shows formation of well-dispersed

spherical Ag particles [Fig. 3(a)]. The average diameter of the Ag particles estimated from
the λmax in OAS in Fig. 2 and TEM image in Fig. 3(a) is ∼ 90 ˚A.

Addition of Phe to the sol results in a decrease in intensity of peak A (due to a single silver

particle), along with an appearance of a new band at around 561 nm (B) due to aggregated

Ag particles. In Fig. 2 we have shown the change in the optical absorption spectrum of

Ag sol with addition of Phe of pH varying from 1.5 to 12.5. The change in the ratio of

intensity of peak B to that of peak A with variation in pH is shown in Fig. 4. The nature

of aggregation of the silver particles, with addition of Phe of diﬀerent pH, as obtained from

TEM images, is shown in Fig. 3(b) to Fig. 3(d). Addition of Phe at a very low pH (below

pH 2) to the Ag sol results in an immediate agglomeration and precipitation of Ag particles

(not shown in the ﬁgure). One may also note the green curve in Fig. 2, where any signature

of colloidal Ag particle is nearly absent. Between pH 2 and pH 3.5 the metal particles

agglomerate appreciably. However, they are not big enough to precipitate immediately [Fig.

3(b) for pH 2]. For Phe with medium pH in Ag sol, one observes clustering of Ag particles in

solution without much agglomeration or precipitation [Fig. 3(c) for pH 8 of Phe]. Addition

of Phe at very high pH values (above 9) prohibits the clustering of Ag particles, which now

spread out in solution [Fig. 3(d)].

In Fig. 5 we have shown the Raman spectrum of an aqueous Phe solution of 0.5 M

( mentioned as Phe-C in the rest of the article) at pH 6.5 within the spectral window of
500- 3200 cm−1 (after subtracting the broad background of water in the range 1500-1800
cm−1 and 2800-3200 cm−1). The assignments of bands in Phe-C, summarized in Table I,

are based on the available Raman data for Phe [10, 11]. The most intense band at 1008

cm−1 has been assigned to the benzene ring breathing mode (ν1). Other less intense but
prominent bands appear at 901 cm−1, 929 cm−1, 1036 cm−1, and 1595 cm−1 due to νC−C,
C-COO-, CN and NH+

3 vibrations, respectively. The bands belonging to νCH, νC00−, CH2

wagging, CH2 deformation are weak and observed at 2976 (also at 1251), 1413, 1332 and
1400 cm−1, respectively. COO− rocking, wagging, and bending modes appear between 500
and 700 cm−1. The feature at 3080 is due to the breathing motion of the hydrogen atoms

in the benzene ring (C-H vibration).

SERS spectra (solid lines) of 1× 10−3 M Phe, 2-3 orders of magnitude more dilute than

the concentration typically required for nonoresonance Raman scattering, with pH from 1.5

to 12.5 are shown in Fig. 6. We have recorded spectra of Phe-Ag complexes by changing the

pH values by 1.0 unit over this range. However, in Fig. 6, we have shown a few characteristic

spectra. SERS peak positions are also listed in Table 1. The Raman spectrum of aqueous

Phe solution with the low concentration (0.001 M) at pH 7 is shown by the dotted line in

the same ﬁgure.

To understand the interaction of the adsorbed species on the surface of Ag particles, we

6

will make use of both SERS and absorption spectra. It is clear from Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 that

intensities of the above mentioned vibrational modes change in SERS spectra with variation

in pH. It is also interesting to note that below the pH value of 4.5 and above the pH value

of 10 the SERS spectrum is extremely weak for the complex. As we mentioned before, upon

addition of Phe of very low pH (below 3.5, value of pK1 = 2.58) the Ag particles agglomerate

and then precipitate or form bigger particles [see Fig. 2 green curve and also Fig. 3 (b)].

The high pH value (above 9.5, pK2 = 9.24) results in a spreading of Ag particles, as shown

in Fig. 3(d). The slight red shifted broad navy blue spectrum for pH 12 in Fig. 2 indicates

the absence of agglomerated Ag particles alone in the sol. Under both these conditions the

number of hot sites decreases in solution, which in turn results in a decrease in the intensity

of the SERS spectrum.

In other words, the ineﬃcient SERS is related to the failure of

colloid activation due to insuﬃcient complexation of Phe to the Ag surface. Intensities of

the vibrational bands in SERS spectra are quite prominent, though of varying intensities,

for the pH values ranging from 4.5 to 9.5. Thus, from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we conclude that for

eﬃcient SERS the aggregation of Ag colloidal particles (Intensity ratio of B to A in optical

absorption spectra) plays an important role via the formation of hot sites.

The SERS spectra at pH below 3.5, between 3.5 and 9.5, and above 9.5 should correspond

to species I, II and III respectively, shown in Fig. 1(a). For Benzene molecule [2] SERS

surface selection rule states that vibrational bands which draw the intensity of Raman

polarizability component αzz is most intense, where z is the surface normal. If a benzene

molecule is absorbed, such that the ring lies parallel to the metal surface, αzz contributes only
to its two A1g modes ν1 (at 992 cm−1) and ν2 (at 3056 cm−1). The maximum contribution

to the αzz component of the polarizability of benzene comes from the π- electrons. Thus, ν1,

which perturbs the carbon ring directly, plays a more prominent role in aﬀecting αzz than

ν2, which involves only hydrogen atoms [2]. However, if the benzene ring is perpendicular

to the metal surface rather than lying parallel, one expects ν2 would be more intense than

ν1. In aqueous Phe these two peaks of the aromatic ring structure appear at 1008 and 3080
cm−1. In SERS spectra these modes are obtained at 1000 and 3065 cm−1. Above the pH
value 3.5, the intensity of the band at 1000 cm−1 increases with increase in pH of Phe till
the pH value reaches 9.5. Beyond this value of pH the 1000 cm−1 band disappears [Fig.
7a]. The low intensity ratio of the band at 1000 cm−1 and 3056 cm−1 compared to what

we observe for Phe-C (Fig. 5) indicates that the aromatic ring of Phe is absorbed nearly

7

parallel to the surface of the Ag colloids. With increase in pH there is a conformational

change in the molecule; the attached molecule tilts more and more towards the surface

(ﬂatter) as indicated by the increase in ratio of I(ν1)/I(ν2), shown in Fig. 7(b). The above

intensity variation and shift in the frequency of these bands in the SERS spectrum with

respect to their frequencies in the spectrum of the solution, indicate that the π-system of

Phe participates in complex formation with Ag.

In Fig. 6, a relatively strong band at 1375 cm−1 beyond pH value 3.5 (note that pK1 =2.58

for Phe) and the variation in intensity of this band with pH indicates that the carboxylic
group, -COO−, upon deprotonation is clearly absorbed on the surface of the Ag colloids
[Fig. 8(a)]. There are several weak bands between 500 and 750 cm−1 due to diﬀerent COO−

vibrational modes.
In SERS spectra of Phe-Ag the CH- stretching vibration appears at
2915 cm−1. The νCH2 vibrational modes are absent in SERS spectra, indicating that the

methylene group is relatively far from the Ag surface. Though, it is not expected that the
NH+
3 group be directly attached to Ag+ colloids in the sol, the relatively strong band due to
3 at 1582 cm−1 indicates that amine group of the molecule
asymmetrical deformation of NH+

stays relatively close to the Ag surface. The intensity of this band drops down with increase
in pH as NH+
3 transforms to NH2 [Fig. 8(b)]. The relatively strong band due to νCN at
1036 cm−1, and its increase in intensity with increase in pH [Fig. 8(c)] can be explained by

assuming the proximity of amine group to the silver surface.

B. Tyrosine (Tyr) : Results and Discussion

The optical absorption spectra of Tyr at diﬀerent pH in colloidal solution of Ag are shown

in Fig. 9. As observed in case of Phe [Fig. 2], the addition of Tyr to the sol results in the

appearance of a new band at around 520 nm (B1) due to aggregation of Ag sol along with

a decrease in intensity of peak A (due to a single particle). The variation in the ratio of the

intensity of peak B1 to that of peak A with change in pH is shown in Fig. 10. The nature

of aggregation of the silver particles with addition of Tyr of diﬀerent pH, as obtained from

TEM images are shown in Fig. 11 (a) - Fig. 11(c).

In Fig. 12 we have shown the Raman spectrum of an aqueous Tyr solution of 0.5 M

(Tyr-C) at pH 6.0 (after subtracting the luminescence background). The assignment of

vibrational bands in Tyr-C has been summarized in Table II. The most intense band at 828

8

cm−1 has been assigned to the breathing mode of the aromatic ring structure of Tyr [8].
Other less intense but prominent bands, appear at 931 cm−1, 1304 cm−1 and 2967 cm−1,
are due to C-COO−, CH2 wagging and CH vibrations, respectively. The bands belonging to
νCH vibrations in the ring appears at 3061 cm−1.

The SERS spectra of Tyr (1× 10−3 M) with pH 1.5 to 12.5 are shown in Fig. 13. Raman

spectrum of aqueous Tyr solution of same concentration at pH 7 is shown by a dotted line

in the same ﬁgure. It is interesting to note that though the molecular structure of Tyr is

similar to that of Phe except for an -OH group in the para position of the aromatic ring,

the SERS spectrum is entirely diﬀerent from that of Phe. In aqueous solution, Tyr becomes
Tyrosinate, TyrO−, at pH of 10.07 (pK3). However, Tyr deprotonates upon adsorption,
ie. they are absorbed as TyrO− on metal surface (It has been shown that SERS spectra

of Tyr-Ag should cover much narrower spectral region) [3, 8]. We assign the broad and
unresolved band between 1200 and 1500 cm−1 in Fig. 13, measured with long integration

time (5 minutes as in our case) for the range of pH value from 3.5 to 9.5, to temporal

averaging (averaging of strongly ﬂuctuating contribution to overall intensity proﬁle) of Tyr

SERS spectrum. The reason is the following : In addition to the direct coordination of the
aromatic ring with Ag+, TyrO− can be adsorbed on the Ag surface either via the carboxylic

acid group or via both the amino and carboxylic group or via the phenol hydroxyl group.

The ensemble average of all these complexations results in a broad band. This has been also

been shown from quantum chemical estimates of vibrational energies using Hartree-Fock
self-consistent ﬁeld molecular orbital calculation for TyrO−-Ag complex [3]. In Fig. 14 we
have shown the variation in the intensity of the peak at 1390 cm−1 with the pH of the Tyr

solution. In the acidic region ( pH<4.5) an extensive aggregation [Fig. 11(a)] of the colloid

9

silver leads to a complete loss of the SERS signal.The decrease in SERS spectral intensity

for higher pH at 10.5 and above is due to spreading out of the Ag particles in sol, which

decreases the number of hot sites necessary for SERS [Fig 11 (c)]. Following the discussion

on Phe-Ag complex, the role of agglomeration of Ag particles (formation of the number of

hot sites in metal sol) to exhibit eﬃcient SERS of Tyr-Ag complex is also clear from the

variation in intensity ratio of peak A and peak B1 with pH in absorption spectra as shown

in Fig. 10 and also from the TEM images shown in Fig. 11.

C. Comparison of interaction in Phe-Ag and Tyr-Ag complex

From the above experimental results and the corresponding discussion we observe that the

Phe and Tyr molecules behave very diﬀerently while forming complexes with Ag molecules.

For Phe the aromatic ring lies nearly ﬂat on Ag surface. Both carboxylic and amine groups

are important in adsorption of Phe on metal particles; whereas, the methylene (CH2) group

is relatively inert. This signiﬁes that the aromatic ring, carboxylic and amine group of Phe

lie in close proximity of metal particles, whereas the methylene group stays away. On the

other hand, Tyr adsorbs on Ag surface as Tyrosinate. At any instant of time, interaction

of metal ion either with carboxylic group or with amine group or with oxygen in the side

chain can be more probable than the other two interactions.

To support our above conjecture, we have looked into the atomic charge distribution at

the diﬀerent terminals of Phe and Tyr molecules in the energy minimized zwitterionic forms

(which bind with Ag ion to form a complex), shown in Fig. 15 (a) and 15(b). From the

hybrid density functional theory, it has been shown that while forming a complex with Phe
or Tyr, the Ag+ preferentially occupies the cavity formed in the molecular structure, shown

in Fig. 15 [13].

If one takes into account only the electrostatic aﬃnity between Ag and

Phe/Tyr molecule, from the atomic charge distribution, shown in Fig. 15, it appears that

the following interactions are possible for both Ag-Phe or Ag-Tyr complexes - (a)it is unlikely
for the NH+
3 group to be directly attached with the positively charged Ag surface, though
it is in close proximity of the Ag+, (b) the CH2 group is away from Ag+, which results in a

weak electrostatic interaction between them, (c) the negative charge distribution on oxygen

atoms of the carboxylic acid group and ring structure indicate the possibility of a strong

electrostatic interaction with the positive metal ion (d) the aromatic ring is parallel to the

10

surface of the Ag+. From a more careful analysis we see that in Phe the charges on the

oxygen atoms of the carboxylic group are - 0.56 units, whereas, those on Tyr are - 0.29 and

- 0.36 units. The side chain oxygen atom of Tyr has a charge of - 0.34 units. We believe

the relatively large negative charge on oxygen terminals in Phe holds the positive metal ion

ﬁrm in its position via Coulombic interactions. However, the relatively less negative charge

at the carboxylic oxygen terminals and at the side chain result in a smeared position of the
Ag+ in the Tyr cavity [Fig. 15 (b)] compared to what we observe in case of the Phe-Ag

complex [Fig. 15 (a)]. This explains the weak and broad SERS band for Tyr-Ag complex. It

is also interesting to note that except in these terminals, the charge distributions are nearly

the same on all other atoms in Phe and Tyr.

IV. KINETIC MEASUREMENTS ON AG-PHE AND AG-TYR INTERACTION

We have seen in the previous section that the formation of hot sites due to the optimum

agglomeration of Ag colloidal particles plays a direct role to form stable Ag-ligand complex.

In this section, we have conﬁrmed the same fact by measuring the interaction kinetics of Phe-

Ag and Tyr-Ag complexes by SERS and absorption measurements. To study the kinetics of

the interaction we have recorded the intensity of optical absorption peak at 535 nm (peak B

due to agglomerated Ag in Fig. 2) for Phe-Ag complex and 490 nm (peak B1 in Fig. 9) for

Tyr-Ag complex with time. The variations in intensities of these two peaks with time are

shown in Fig. 16 (a) and 16 (b), respectively. We clearly observe two diﬀerent decay rates

for both the peaks. For the ﬁrst 120 sec the decay process is very fast compared to what

is observed later. The decay time constants are 58 (τ1) sec and 178 (τ2) sec for Phe and 63

(τ1) sec and 100 (τ2) sec for Tyr.

To correlate the optical absorption and SERS measurements, we studied the kinetics of
SERS spectra of 5 × 10−3 M ligand- Ag mixture at pH 8 (about which we get maximum

SERS intensity for the most intense peaks). Each spectrum was taken for 2 minutes with
1 minute interval. The exponential drop in intensities of the strongest band at 1000 cm−1
for Phe and the band at 1392 cm−1 in Tyr are shown in Fig. 17(a) and 17(b). The decay

constants are estimated to be 213 sec and 113 sec, respectively. These values of the time

constants match reasonably well with the values of τ2, which we have obtained from optical

absorption measurements. Thus, we conﬁrm that the metal-amino acid interaction is directly

11

related to the aggregation of the Ag colloids. Here we would like to mention that because

of experimental limitations the absorption spectra in Fig. 2 and Fig. 10 or SERS spectra

in Fig. 6 and Fig. 14 are recorded 2 minutes after addition of amino acids in Ag sol. Thus,

the eﬀect of initial kinetics of interaction, at time scale τ1, is not observed in these spectra.

However, a careful observation of the initial change in colour of the sol with addition of

amino acid indicates fast kinetics of the interaction between ligand molecules and Ag sol.
The as-prepared Ag sol is yellow in colour and is stable for more than 24 hrs at 4 ◦C. The

agglomeration of the particle after addition of amino acids changes the colour from yellow to

pink to blood red as shown in Fig. 18 (a) for Phe and yellow to amber to olive green as shown

in Fig. 18 (b) for Tyr. It is to be noted that the change in colouration of the solution is
rapid (distinct by naked eye) for ﬁrst ∼ 60 seconds for both Phe-Ag and Tyr-Ag. This time

scale matches with value of τ1 obtained from kinetic studies by absorption measurements.

This initial change in color may be due to the increase in the size of the particles from

single particle to doublets, triplets and higher multiplets. Gradually, with time, the colour

of the solution fades out indicating the breakdown of agglomerated particles into smaller

fragments.

V. SUMMARY

Though structurally close, Phe and Tyr, behave very diﬀerently, when they form com-

plexes with Ag colloids. To understand this diﬀerence, we have compared the metal-amino

acid interaction in Phe-Ag and Tyr-Ag complexes by pH dependent SERS measurements.

From the intensity variations of the vibrational bands in SERS spectra with the pH of the ad-

sorbates, we have proposed the relative orientation and interaction of the adsorbed molecules

on the Ag surface. We have addressed a long standing query, as to whether the amine group

is directly attached with Ag surface along with carboxylate group in these systems. Using

Gasteiger-H¨uckel method to estimate the atomic charge distribution at diﬀerent terminals of

the zwitterionic amino acid molecules, we have noted that, though the structures of Phe and

Tyr are quite similar, (except an -OH group at the para position of the ring in the latter), the

atomic charge distributions at the oxygen sites of these molecules, are quite diﬀerent. If we

assume only the electrostatic interaction between diﬀerent terminals of the adsorbates with
Ag+, the above charge distribution conﬁrms the interaction and orientation of the amino

12

acid molecules in the complexes, which we have proposed from SERS measurements.

In addition, the appearance of SERS bands have been explained with the help of pH

dependent TEM and optical absorption measurements. We have seen that formation of hot

sites via optimum aggregation of Ag particles induced by Phe/Tyr results in an increase in

intensity of the optical absorption band of the Ag aggregates and, concurrently, an increase

in SERS band intensities. We have also shown that the state of aggregation is a key pa-

rameter in SERS. We have discussed the reaction kinetics of this interaction process using

spectroscopic measurements.

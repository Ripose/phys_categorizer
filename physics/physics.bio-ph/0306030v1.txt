An Inverse Equilibrium Maximum Entropy Algorithm
Applied To Proteins

Abstract

A computational method is developed to work on an inverse equilib-
rium problem with an interest towards applications with protein folding.
In general, we are given a set of equilibrium conﬁgurations, and want to
derive the most likely potential function that results in these conﬁgura-
tions. The method is applied to polymer simulations and a simple model
of proteins using protein structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank
(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) The resulting energy function is tested on a
few decoy sets with limited success.

Introduction

The Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) [3] has about 19,000 protein
structures solved by several methods. There are many algorithms that use this
information to derive understanding about protein interactions. Our method
is based on using these equilibrium conﬁgurations and a maximum entropy
algorithm to derive information about physical energy functions that could be
used to approximate protein interactions.

Our Method

The following is based largely on an algorithm originally developed by reference
[5]. The method is based on the following assumptions. The system is assumed
to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. For proteins, this was shown to be a good
assumption by Anﬁnsen [1]. We also assume the energy can be written as a sum
of terms which are products of parameters and functions of the conﬁguration.
E(Γ, ~P ) = Pi pi ∗ hi(Γ) = ~P · ~H where Γ represents the conﬁguration of the
system(s). ~P = {pi} represents the set of parameters to be derived.

The probability of a conﬁguration, given parameters, is given by the Boltz-
mann distribution P rob(Γ| ~P ) = e−E(Γ, ~P )/kT /Z = e(−E(Γ, ~P )+F ( ~P ))/kT ,where
Z( ~P ) = PΓ Exp(−βE(Γ, ~P )) and F ( ~P ) = −kT ln(Z( ~P )).
If we are given the exact equilibrium conformation, Γ∗ , the maximum likeli-
hood of parameter values are those values for which the probability, P rob(Γ∗| ~P )
is a maximum wrt ~P . Maximizing an exponential corresponds to maximizing the
argument (ignoring the multiplicative constant β), −E(Γ∗, ~P ) + F ( ~P ) = Q( ~P ).
This also corresponds to extremizing the entropy T S = E − F .

Our method is basically the multi-dimensional form of Newton’s method for

optimizing functions. Maximizing Q( ~P ), Newton’s Method is

~P k+1 = ~P k − D2(Q( ~P k))

−1 · D(Q( ~P k))

where (D2)−1 represents the inverse Hessian matrix and D represents the gra-
dient. In practice this is modiﬁed slightly,

~P k+1 = ~P k + ǫ(∆ ~P )

where the use of ǫ < 1 corresponds to the ”Damped Newton’s Method”.

Maximizing Q = −E + F wrt ~P leads to the following.

D(Q)i = −h

∗
i + < hi >

D2(Q)i,j = β(< hi >< hj > − < hihj >) = −βCov(hi, hj)

Resulting in the following iterative equation where V CM ( ~H) is the variance-
covariance matrix of ~H

∆ ~P = kT ∗ V CM ( ~H)

−1 • (< ~H > − ~H ∗)

The method is easily generalized to a distribution of equilibrium conﬁgurations.

∆ ~P = kT ∗ V CM ( ~H)

−1 • (< ~H > − < ~H >P rob(Γ))

< ... > represents a Boltzmann average and < ... >P rob(Γ) represents an average
over the given distribution.

Assuming the least prior information, the iteration starts with all parameters
set to zero. This would not allow any useful MC evolution at all. The energy
would be zero for any Monte Carlo move, thus not preferring any particular
move. The energy is modiﬁed for the ﬁrst few iterations with the addition of a
clamping term.

Eclamp = X Pclamp ∗ (r − r

∗

)2

(10)

This term makes the given conformation a minimum of the energy. Since this
conformation is an equilibrium conformation, this seems to be a good approxi-
mation. Once the parameter values are suﬃciently away from zero, this term is
set to zero. If a distribution of conformations is given, this distribution can be
used as the clamping terms.

Computation

The basic algorithm is as follows.

• Given P k, Monte Carlo simulations and averaging are used to ﬁnd < hj >

and < hihj >.

• This leads to a matrix equation. ∆ ~P = kT ∗ V CM ( ~H)−1 • (< ~H > − ~H ∗)

• Solve this for ∆ ~P

• ~P k+1 = ~P k + ǫ(∆ ~P )

• Repeat until ~P converges.

Computation: Convergence time

Assuming a system of M proteins, each containing N particles with P param-
eters. The Monte Carlo time required for useful averaging scales at least as
N . The pair-wise energy calculation in each Monte Carlo step scales as N 2.
Although for some models a radius cutoﬀ and neighbor list were used, so this
eﬀect in practice is less than indicated. Solving a P by P matrix equation is a
P 3 operation. Computation time for this method scales as

αM ∗ N 3 + βP 3

(11)

Simulation

A Monte Carlo evolution was done on several systems. Four energy terms were
used.

(12)

Non-bonded interactions were included similar to an electrostatic attraction
and van der Waals repulsion. The sequence of positive and negative charges was
randomly chosen. A covalent-type bond between one particle and the next in
the sequence was given a quadratic form. For the simulation described below,
the following parameters were used a = 2, b = 4, c = −4, d = 1. The results of
the algorithm applied to this system are shown in ﬁgure 1 and table 1.

Protein Model

Several major simpliﬁcations were made to allow convergence of real protein
parameters in a reasonable time. The united residue approximation is used
in the following model. Each of the residues is treated as one particle. This
approximation is commonly used [2, 6, 8]. This greatly simpliﬁes the system,
but should contain enough complexity to describe the system adequately.

Proteins seem to have a rugged free energy surface. To minimize this eﬀect
we use relatively few MC time steps per iteration. This keeps the protein in the
local minimum of free energy even if parameters are far from correct.

Residues were placed at the Cα location, covalently bond only with next and
previous particles on the chain. The energy function used for the covalent bonds
was a normal distribution using the mean and variance derived from the data.
The noise in the covalent bond parameter seemed to cause large perturbations
in the convergence for other parameters. These parameters need to be derived
separately.

The ﬁrst model with consistent convergence used a statistical grouping of
residues developed by Cieplak etal [4]. The groupings were derived using a
simpliﬁcation of a statistically derived interaction matrix, the Miyazawa Jerni-
gan (MJ) matrix [9]. This is a simple, consistent grouping which decreases the
number of parameters.

• Hydrophobic I (ave hydrophobicity scale value 2.6) (LFI) Leucine, Isoleucine

and Phenylalanine

• Hydrophobic II (ave HP scale value 1.8 with large variance) (MVWCY)

Methionine, Valine, Tryptophan, Cysteine and Tyrosine

• Polar I (ave HP scale value 1.15) (HA) Histidine, Alanine

• Polar II (ave HP scale value 0.6) (TGPRQSNED) Threonine, Glycine,
Proline, Arginine, Glutamine, Serine, Asparagine Glutamic acid and As-
partic acid

• Lysine (ave HP scale value 1.9) (K) Lysine

Only one energy term was used corresponding to van der Waals attraction

4ǫ[(σ/r)12 − (σ/r)6]

(13)

Essentially this is a contact energy function. σ was determined by comparing
typical volumes and treating the residues as spheres. This gives radii from 2.4 -
3.8 Angstrom. σ in the equation corresponds to where the core repulsion occurs
(about 2*radius) so a value of 5 was arbitrarily assumed.

In summary, the covalent properties were approximated from the mean and
variance of bond lengths. The energy function has one term, a 6-12 combined
term. A statistical grouping was used to further reduce parameters. This group-
ing and energy function model has 15 parameters. Results shown below were

5

derived from proteins ranging in size from 20 to 400 residues. For consistency,
only X-ray data and only complete proteins containing no extraneous molecules
were used. The training set contained 821 proteins. All protein structures were
obtained from the Protein Data Bank [3]. Only 20 MC steps per particle were
used.

The zeros were artiﬁcially created, as the algorithm can not handle these pa-
rameters going negative. (ǫ ≥ 0) This would cause the MC to diverge. Despite
this limitation, convergence was achieved. These results imply the least hy-
drophobic (most polar) group essentially has no non-bonded interactions. This
is very similar to the HP model of polymers where hydrophobic collapse is mod-
eled as HH atraction and other interactions (HP and PP) are ignored. This
took 14 days on a Dual PIII 450MHz.

Local Minima Decoy Set (lmds) [7]

Similar analysis was done for the lmds decoy set from C Kesar and M Levitt,
1999. These results were not very encouraging. The correct proteins were
the worst scores in almost all cases and by a large amount. Currently the main
weakness is due to the diﬀerence in derivation for the covalent bonds. This decoy
set was created using a minimization of a backbone torsional energy function,
hence was very diﬀerent from our function. Essentially, our successful decoy set
predictions are based on only non-bonded interaction calculations.

Protein Models - Discussion

The energy function used is extremely simple. Despite this, ranking of the native
protein for some of the decoys was very encouraging. The poor performers
probably need more complex energy functions. Correlation between RMDS and
energy was investigated, but no simple relationship was found. For the best
performers, the native energy was typically isolated at the lowest energy with
most decoys concentrated a distinct diﬀerence in energy away.

The algorithm has potential, but several problems must be overcome. Com-
plexity has not been handled very well and may be required for applicability.
Inclusion of Coulomb, torsional, angular and backbone potential terms are re-
quired for realistic models. All atom and explicit solvent are further steps that
can be taken. Terms of smaller magnitude are dominated by eﬀects of terms
with larger magnitude and have to be separately derived. Similarly, terms with
smaller frequency of occurrence are dominated by more frequent terms. This
separate derivation of terms can be organized and iterated consistently.

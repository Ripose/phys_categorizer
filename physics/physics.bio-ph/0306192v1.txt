Abstract

Based on the Stochastic Inclined Rods Model (SIRM) proposed by
H. Matsuura and M. Nakano, we study the microscopic motion of actin
myosin system including the motion of the G-actin. Our model is com-
posed of an inclined spring (rod), a myosin head, a myosin ﬁlament and
G-actins. We discuss the stochastic resonance between the myosin head
and random noise. The results of calculation show that the model can
convert the random motion to one directional motion, and the myosin
head works as a resonator of random noise which absorbs the energy
through the stochastic resonance. The intermolecular potential between
the myosin head and G-actin and the inclined rod play a key role for the
muscle’s motion. The energy consumed by the motor is directly supplied
from the surroundings (i.e., the thermal motions of water molecules).
Keywords : SIRM, Intermolecular potential, Actin myosin system.

Introduction

Biological systems are among the most challenging subjects for theoretical physi-
cists as well as experimentalists or simulationists. More and more biologists
and theoretical biophysicists have focused on studying the mechanism of living
systems and mincing the biological structure to invent subtle artiﬁcial instru-
ments. Nowadays it is exciting to study a problem how motor protein gets a
energy of movement and what makes myosin slide in one direction along the
ﬁlaments. Based on diﬀerent system, three diﬀerent families of motor proteins
have been identiﬁed [1][2][3]: Kinesis and dyneins move along tubulin ﬁlaments
[4], myosin moves along actin ﬁlaments [5][6]. The motion mechanism of these
motors can be described in general as follows [1][7][8]: ﬁrstly the motor protein
binds Adenosinetriphoshpate (ATP), then hydrolyzes the bound ATP and ab-
sorbs the energy, subsequently, it releases the products Adenosinediphosphate
(ADP) and Phosphate (P). So the motors move constantly within chemical cy-
cle. The molecular motors play a key role in transducing chemical energy into
mechanical work at a molecular scale.

In 1954 H. F. Huxley, H. E. Huxley and R. M. Simmons [9][10][11] proposed
the rotation cross bridge model to study muscular mobility. In these earliest

1

theoretical descriptions, the asymmetry of the system was introduced via asym-
metric transition rates and speciﬁc conformational changes were also discussed.
This model has been widely spread in past two decades and has become a
standard model even in college textbooks, but extensive experimentations have
failed to ﬁnd evidence for a large conformational change in myosin head during
the force generation process [12]. So it is worth while to reconsider an old idea,
proposed by A. F. Huxley in 1957, the motor protein uses thermal energy that
exists at physiological temperature to perform work [13], such as the thermal
ratchet model [14] [15], the isothermal ratchet model [16].

Recently, there have been many reports that discuss the relation between
the muscle’s movement and Stochastic Resonance (SR) or thermal noise [17][18]
[19][20]. These explanations, however, somewhat abstract from the viewpoint
of biology, and these models are lacking in dynamic descriptions of actin myosin
interaction.

The newly resonance models for muscle’s motion was named the Stochas-
tic Inclined Rods Model (SIRM) proposed by H. Matsuura and M. Nakano
[21][22][23][24]. The energy of the motion was supplied from the random noise
and the system always moves to one direction by using of stochastic resonance.
The movement of the system does not break the second law of the thermody-
namics, because the actin myosin system is open to the surroundings and the
energy ﬂows in from their surroundings. The SIRM presents a perfectly sliding
mechanism for the actin myosin system.

The main aim of our paper is to study the motion of actin myosin system in-
cluding the G-actin’s motion. We discuss the stochastic resonance of the myosin
head and give the numerical results for the motion of the system. We ﬁnd that
there is a relative sliding motion between the G-actin and the myosin owing to
the intermolecular potential and the structure of the inclined rod.

2 Model and Formalism

The structure of the actin myosin system is shown in Fig. 1[21] together with
structure of the muscle. It consists of the chain structure of the actin of length
around 100 nm and a bundle of hundreds of myosin which has an inclined rod
and a head of 0.45 million Dalton. The whole system exists in a water solution
and the interaction with water molecules cannot be neglected.

In order to explain the contraction of the muscle, namely solve the motion
of actin myosin system, we simulate it by a mechanical model as shown in Fig.
2. We call this model as stochastic inclined rod model (SIRM). The motion
mechanism of the SIRM is as follows: ﬁrstly, ATP is hydrolyzed and releases
the energy which makes the random noise interacts with the myosin head and
myosin head obtains the energy from random noise then the head vibrates, it
collides with a G-actin and obliquely kicks the G-actin sphere, because the di-
rection of vibration is inclined against the line of the actin ﬁbers and myosin
molecules obtain the propellant force along the direction of the ﬁbers. In this

Fig. 1

way, the ﬁlament can move to one direction while the G-actin moves to oppo-
site direction. The actin myosin system can move to one direction owing to the
structure of inclined rods of myosin and the intermolecular potential between
the myosin head and the G-acin.

According to Fig. 2 we can construct the equations of the motion for the head
of myosin.

stochastic resonance

We discuss the stochastic resonance between the myosin head and the thermal
noise to show that SIRM moves to one direction with accepting energy from
thermal noise. Because the above equations are so complex and highly non-
linear that we cannot obtain a strict analytical solution, we only discuss the
motion of the myosin head and set up the following simple equation for the
head, where the j-th G-actin is the nearest one to the head:

When ε = 0 and µ2 > ω2

If ε

So we can rewrite the Eq.(14) as follow:

So the solution of the Eq. (18) should have the same form as that of Eq.(14),

but the amplitude a should be satisﬁed the following relation:

Where σ = 3a2

between the resonance amplitude and the shift frequency from the resonance
point.

32m2ω3

Fig. 3

The ﬁgure shows the relation between the square of resonance amplitude σ and
the shift frequency from the resonance point ∆, which is the solution of the Eq.
(21). If the amplitude of noise F is small, the peak occurs at ∆ = 0, as the
amplitude of the noise increases, the shape of σ changes gradually while it keeps
the character that has the only one maximum, which truly shows the existence
of the stochastic resonance between the myosin head and the thermal noise.

After a suﬃcient time, the damping terms of the Eq.(16) go to zero, and only
oscillational term aei(Ωt−δ) survives. It is clear that these equations (Eq. (1)-
Eq. (4)) do not have an energy source except the thermal noise term F (t). In
the case, the energy of the myosin has the constant value which is determined
by the amplitude a. And the average absorbed energy per unit time will be
E(Ω) = 2Ω2µma2.

4 Numerical results

We adopt a numerical method to solve the above equations. The parameters of
the equations are shown in the Table.1.

Table. 1

The numerical results are shown in Fig. 4-Fig. 8.

The ﬁgure shows the horizontal position of myosin head, the trace has irregular-
ity and randomness like Brownian particles, but movement is a translacational
one as a whole.

The solid line shows the vertical motion of the myosin head and the stretching
motion of the rod is described with the dash line. From the ﬁgure we can know
that the stretching vibration of the spring has irregularity and the collision be-
tween the G-actin and the myosin head distorts their relative motion from a
trigonometric function.

The dash line shows the motion of the ﬁlament and the solid line shows the
position of the G-actin. From the ﬁgure we can know there is a relative sliding
motion between the ﬁlament and the G-actin. The ﬁlament can move to one
direction while the G-actin moves to opposite direction.

The ﬁgure gives the relative between the horizontal movement of myosin ﬁla-
ment and the initial angle. From the ﬁgure we can know that the motor can
move fastest when the initial angle is nearly equal to 45◦ . But if the initial
angle is too small or too big, the motor moves slowly, even cannot move. So the
initial angle of the inclined rod is important for SIRM to move to one direction.

From the ﬁgure we can know that the shape of the G-actin is important for the
system to move. If the G-actin if ﬂat (R = 0) the SIRM can not move, on the
other hand, if the radius of the G-actin is too big (R = 40). The system can
not move, either. The motor can move at the highest speed at R = 20.

5 Summary and conclusion

Based on SIRM we present a sliding mechanism for the actin myosin system
and set up the dynamic equations for the model. Because equations (Eq. (1)
- Eq. (8) ) are so complex and highly nonlinear that we cannot obtain a strict
analytical solution, we adopt a numerical method to solve these two dimensional
Langevin equations. We discuss the motion of the myosin head and ﬁnd there
is a stochastic resonance between the head and the noise. Our model propose a
microscopic mechanism for the actin myosin system: ﬁrstly, the thermal noise

interacts with the myosin head, and the resonance occurs between the myosin
head and the noise, then it collides with a G-actin and obliquely kicks the G-
actin sphere, because the direction of vibration is inclined against the line of the
actin ﬁbers, myosin molecules obtain the propellant force along the direction of
the ﬁber and the myosin can move to one direction.

From the numerical results we can know there is a relative sliding motion
between the ﬁlament and the G-actin. The ﬁlament can move to one direc-
tion while the G-actin moves to opposite direction. When the system absorbs
the energy from the thermal noise constantly through stochastic resonance, the
intermolecular potential and the inclined rod make the ﬁlament move to one
direction. The system can convert the random noise to one directional motion.
SIRM is thermally open to the outer surroundings and it has a outer heat source
of ATP. The heat consumed by SIRM is directly supplied from the surround-
ings and the energy provided to the surroundings comes from the outer source
or reservior through a general energetic ﬂow. From a macroscopic point of view,
SIRM can move by getting heat from its surroundings.

Noise in dynamical systems is usually considered a nuisance. But in certain
nonlinear systems including electronic circuits and biological sensory apparatus
the presence of noise can in fact enhance the detection of the weak signals. From
the above results, we point out the possibility that the actin myosin system can
use thermal noise around for the movement in similar way. This viewpoint is
completely new as the traditional viewpoint thinks the water disturbs the mo-
tion as viscosity.

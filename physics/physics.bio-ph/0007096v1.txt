(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We examine the scaling law B ∝ M α which connects organismal metabolic rate B with organismal
mass M , where α is commonly held to be 3/4. Since simple dimensional analysis suggests α = 2/3,
we consider this to be a null hypothesis testable by empirical studies. We re-analyze data sets for
mammals and birds compiled by Heusner, Bennett and Harvey, Bartels, Hemmingsen, Brody, and
Kleiber, and ﬁnd little evidence for rejecting α = 2/3 in favor of α = 3/4. For mammals, we ﬁnd
a possible breakdown in scaling for larger masses reﬂected in a systematic increase in α. We also
review theoretical justiﬁcations of α = 3/4 based on dimensional analysis, nutrient-supply networks,
and four-dimensional biology. We ﬁnd that present theories for α = 3/4 require assumptions that
render them unconvincing for rejecting the null hypothesis that α = 2/3.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The “3/4-law” of metabolism states that organismal
basal metabolic rate, B, is related to organismal mass,
M , via the power law [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

B = cM α,

(1)

where α is believed to be 3/4. The assumption that α =
3/4 is relevant in medicine [7, 8, 9], nutrition [10, 11, 12],
and ecology [2, 13, 14, 15], and has been the subject of a
series of theoretical debates [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. It has
been oft quoted that quarter-power scaling is ubiquitous
in biology [2, 22]. Such quarter-law scaling reinforces,
and is reinforced by, the notion that basal metabolic rate
scales like B ∝ M 3/4.
Nevertheless, the reasons, biological or otherwise, for
why α = 3/4 have remained elusive and their elucida-
tion stands as an open theoretical problem. A recent
surge of interest in the subject, including our own, has
been inspired by the elegant attempt of West, Brown and
Enquist [22] to link nutrient-supply networks to metabol-
ic scaling. This work suggests that a fundamental under-
standing of the relationship between basal metabolism
and body size is within our grasp and that closer inspec-
tion of both theory and data are duly warranted.

In this paper we work from the null hypothesis that
α = 2/3. In a resting state, heat is predominantly lost
through the surface of a body. One then expects, from
naive dimensional analysis, that basal metabolism scales
as surface area which scales as V 2/3 where V , volume, is
proportional to M presuming density is constant. This
scaling of surface area with mass has found strong empir-
ical support in organismic biology [2, 6, 23, 24]. Such a

surface law of metabolism was ﬁrst expounded in the
nineteenth century [25]. Later observations of devia-
tions from α = 2/3 eventually led to its replacement by
α ≃ 0.72–0.73 which was then supplanted by the sim-
pler α = 3/4 [4, 23, 26].
The widespread agreement
that α = 3/4 is due largely to the formative inﬂuence of
Kleiber [3, 4, 27] and has been accepted and used as a
general rule for decades [21].

We re-examine empirical data available for metabol-
ic rates of homoiotherms as well as carefully review
both recent and historical theoretical justiﬁcations for
α = 3/4. Our statistical analysis of data collated by
Heusner [28] for 391 species of mammals and by Ben-
nett and Harvey [29] for 398 species of birds shows that
over considerable, but not all, ranges of body size, the
hypothesis α = 2/3 is not rejected by the available data.
We also review empirical studies by Bartels [30], Hem-
mingsen [23], Brody [26], and Kleiber [3] and ﬁnd the
data, upon re-examination, to be supportive of our inter-
pretations. We then examine theoretical attempts to con-
nect metabolic rate to mass. These include approaches
based on dimensional analysis [1, 18, 31, 32, 33, 34],
four-dimensional biology [35, 36], and nutrient-supply
networks [22, 37]. We ﬁnd that none of these theories
convincingly show that α = 3/4, rather than α = 2/3,
should be expected.

However, we do not suggest that the 3/4-law should be
replaced by a 2/3-law of allometric scaling. We instead
argue for a more general approach to the subject, using
α = 2/3 as a null hypothesis which should be tested by
empiricists when considering α 6= 2/3, and acknowledge
the possibility of deviations from simple scaling.

mammals (M ≤ 0.01 kg, 17 species) a large error is apparent
but for increasing Mmax, α centers around 2/3. A gradual
upwards drift in α is evident for Mmax > 10 kg.

FIG. 1: Metabolic rate, B (watts), as a function of mass,
M (kg),
for 391 species of mammals. Data taken from
Heusner [28]. The straight line represents the best ﬁt for
the 357 species with mass less than 10 kg where the α =
0.668 ± 0.019. The upward deviations for species with larger
mass (see Table I) may indicate a real biological diﬀerence
but may also be due to the paucity of data.

ter understand the scaling of metabolic rate, we work
back in time, calculating α and deviations from uniform
scaling for data from Heusner [28], Bennett and Har-
vey [29], Bartels [30], Hemmingsen [23], Brody [26], and
Kleiber [3]. These papers represent some of the most
inﬂuential, widely cited, and often controversial papers in
the ﬁeld. Our re-analysis of the data demonstrates that
α = 2/3 should not be rejected for mammals with mass
less than approximately 10–35 kg, and a similar analysis
of metabolic data for birds demonstrates α = 2/3 should
not be rejected for birds in general.

We have used the same methods to calculate α and
its dependence on M in all cases where data is avail-
able. Slopes and intercepts are determined using stan-
dard linear regression in log-space taking M to be the
independent variable. The standard correlation coeﬃ-
cient is denoted by r while that obtained using the Spear-
man rank ordering [38] is written as rs. When data is not
available we have attempted to classify the data sets in
terms of the original calculations of α and its dependence
on M .

A. Heusner (1991)

Data on basal metabolic rate for 391 mammalian
species compiled by Heusner [28] is reproduced in Fig-
ure 1. Heusner proposed that species could be separated
into two groups, one of animals whose basal metabolism
is normally distributed about a regression line and one of
statistical outliers. Both groups were found by Heusner
to satisfy a 2/3-law for metabolism.

The results of simple regression analysis over various
mass ranges for Heusner’s data are shown in Table I. We
observe a break in scaling occurring at around M ≃ 10
kg. For those ranges with an upper mass Mmax ≤ 10
kg, α = 2/3 appears to be robust. Note that the data
comprises 179 species of the order rodentia ranging over
more than three orders of magnitude of mass from 0.007
kg to 26.4 kg. On separating out these samples, we still
ﬁnd α = 0.675 ± 0.025 for the remaining species with
M ≤ 10 kg and α = 0.681±0.035 for the rodentia species.
Upon addition of mammals with mass exceeding 10 kg,
the exponent steadily increases. Given the small number
of samples of large mammals, one can only speculate on
the reason for this possible deviation. Primarily, it may
indicate a real upwards deviation from scaling, with larg-
er organisms actually having greater metabolic rates than
predicted by α = 2/3 [16, 30, 39]. Larger organisms are
reported to scale allometrically in form so such a devia-
tion may be a result of changes in body shape and hence
surface area [1, 2]. Support for this notion comes from
Economos [31] who ﬁnds the relationship between mam-
malian head-and-body length and mass is better ﬁt by
two scaling laws rather than one. He identiﬁes 20 kg as
a breakpoint, which is in accord with our ﬁndings here,
suggesting that geometric scaling holds below this mass
while allometric quarter-power scaling holds above. The
upper scaling observed by Economos could also be viewed

as part of a gradual deviation from geometric scaling.

The upwards shift of metabolic rates for larger mam-
mals could otherwise point to problems of measure-
ment (note the corrections for elephants in Brody’s
data [26]), an evolutionary advantage related to larger
brain sizes [40, 41], or the lack of competition for ecolog-
ical niches for large mammals creating a distinction with
smaller mammals.

B. Bennett and Harvey (1987)

Birds show strong support for not rejecting the null
hypothesis α = 2/3. Figure 2 shows metabolic data for
398 distinct bird species taken from Bennett and Har-
vey [29, 42]. We ﬁnd here that α = 0.666 ± 0.013
in agreement with Bennett and Harvey’s calculations.
Lasiewski and Dawson [43] similarly found that α =
0.668 for a smaller set of data. Attempts to reconcile the
3/4-law with these measurements have centered around
the division of birds into passerine (perching birds) and
non-passerine species (non-perching birds). Lasiewski
and Dawson, for example, found exponents 0.724 and
0.723 for passerine and non-passerine species respective-
ly. Though this is not an arbitrary division (core tem-
peratures are thought to diﬀer by 1–2◦C), later work by
Kendeigh [44] ﬁnds exponents ranging from 0.668–0.735
when passerines and non-passerines are grouped accord-
ing to diﬀerent measurement conditions (winter vs. sum-
mer, etc.).

Similar distinctions between intra- and inter-species
scaling have been raised in the study of metabolic scaling
for mammals where it has been suggested that α = 2/3
for single species comparisons and α = 3/4 holds across
diﬀering species [1, 6, 19]. Bennett and Harvey [29] also
found that α depends on the level of taxonomic detail one
is investigating. It remains unclear whether such subdivi-
sions reﬂect relevant biological distinctions or underlying
correlations in the choice of taxonomic levels.

C. Bartels (1982)

Bartels [30] analyzes a set of approximately 85 mam-
malian species. Although data is not provided in the
paper, a summary of his results can be found in Table II.
Bartels ﬁnds α = 0.66 (no error estimate is given) for
mammals with mass between 2.4 × 10−3 kg and 3800 kg
and concludes that the deviation from the expected 3/4
scaling is due to the variations in metabolic rates of small
animals. This lends further weight to our conjecture that
there may be a mass dependence of metabolic rate scal-
ing.

D. Hemmingsen (1960)

Hemmingsen’s data set [23] for mammals comprises 15
data points with masses between 0.01 kg and 3500 kg.
Most of his data is derived from earlier work by Brody.
He states that the data is well modeled by a power law
with α = 0.73. To reach this conclusion he does not com-
pute the power law of best ﬁt, but rather, the “straight
line . . . was chosen corresponding to [α =]0.73, as estab-
lished by Kleiber and also by Brody.”

Hemmingsen also ﬁnds that a 3/4-law holds for uni-
cellular organisms. Hemmingsen’s work has been cited
extensively in support of the claim that the 3/4-law is a
universal biological phenomenon [2, 5, 6, 22]. A careful
re-examination of Hemmingsen’s work by Prothero [45]
showed that α can range from approximately 0.60 to 0.75
depending on which unicellular organisms are included in
the regression. In addition to these questions about scal-

of data points and rs is the Spearman correlation coeﬃcient.

ing for unicellular life, Patterson [46, 47] has theoretically
shown for aquatic inverterbrates and algae that the scal-
ing exponent can range from 0.31 to 1.00 depending on
the mass transfer mechanisms involved. We agree with
Prothero’s conclusions that “a three-quarters power rule
expressing energy metabolism as a function of size in uni-
cellular organisms generally is not at all persuasive” [45].

E. Brody (1945)

One of the most inﬂuential works on scaling and
metabolism is that of Brody [26]. Indeed, the scaling law
for metabolism is sometimes cited as the Brody-Kleiber
law. Brody compiles a list of metabolic rates for 67 mam-
mals. The complete data set yields α = 0.73 ± 0.01.
However, on inspection, one makes the surprising obser-
vation that 32 data points are artiﬁcial in that most of
these are calculated using previously determined empiri-
cal equations while a few have been corrected to account
for variations in animal activity. Using the remaining set
of 35 animals we nevertheless ﬁnd α = 0.72 ± 0.02. It is
also important to note that Brody’s research was done
before the widespread use of electrocardiography and, as
pointed out by Kinnear and Brown [48], Brody’s data
may contain overestimations of basal metabolic rate.

We re-analyze Brody’s raw, uncorrected data for mam-
mals over diﬀerent mass ranges as shown in Table III.
Again, an increase in α is observed for ranges of larger
masses. This is consistent with the results from Heusner’s
and Bartel’s data which suggest a deviation from perfect
scaling with increase in mass. Furthermore, it is evident
that α = 0.72 as calculated by regression on the full data
set is misleading. We reiterate that we are not suggesting
that there is any robust scaling law for large masses. The
results of the regression analysis merely suggest a depen-
dence of α on the mass ranges being considered and that
a strict power law may not be appropriate.

F. Kleiber (1932)

In his now-famous paper on metabolic rate, Kleiber
analyzed 13 species of mammals with average mass rang-
ing from 0.15 to 679 kg [3]. We ﬁnd the scaling exponent

4

for the data to be 0.738 ± 0.016. Again we consider the
possibility of a crossover and separate the data into a set
of 5 species with M < 10 kg and 8 species with M > 10
kg. For M < 10 kg, α = 0.667 ± 0.043 while for M > 10
kg, α = 0.754± 0.048. These results are again consistent
with our assertion of a mass-dependent α. Nevertheless,
it is important to remain mindful of the relative paucity
of data in these inﬂuential works.

III. FLUCTUATIONS ABOUT SCALING

The next logical step after measuring the metabolic
exponent and systematic deviations thereof is to consider
ﬂuctuations about the mean. This is seldom done with
power law measurements [49] and researchers concerned
with the predictive power of a scaling law for metabolic
rate have often pointed to organisms that deviate from
predictions as being either problematic or diﬀerent [6,
26, 28, 30]. We take the view that ﬂuctuations are to be
expected and quantiﬁed appropriately.

We thus generalize the relation B = cM α by consider-
ing P (B |M ), the conditional probability density of mea-
suring a metabolic rate, B, given a mass, M ,

P (B |M ) = M −αf (B/M α)

(2)

where the leading factor of M −α is for normalization and
R ∞
0 f (x)dx = 1.
Our null hypothesis is that ﬂuctuations are Gaussian
in logarithmic space, i.e., f is a lognormal distribution.
Gaussian ﬂuctuations are typically assumed in statistical
inferences made using regression analysis [50]. Demon-
strating that f is not inconsistent with a normal distri-
bution will therefore allow us to use certain hypothesis
tests in the following section.

If equation (2) is correct then the sampled data can be
rescaled accordingly to reconstruct f , the scaling func-
tion. To do so, one must ﬁrst determine α. We suggest
the most appropriate estimate of α corresponds to the
case when the residuals about the best ﬁt power law are
uncorrelated with regards to body mass. This is similar
to techniques used in the analysis of partial residuals [51]
and we make use of it later. We obtain residuals for the
range 0.5 ≤ α ≤ 1.5 where the prefactor c of B = cM α
is determined via least squares. The Spearman correla-
tion coeﬃcient rs is then determined for the residuals and
recorded as a function of α. We then take the value of
α for which rs = 0 as the most likely underlying scaling
exponent.

We ﬁnd rs = 0 when α ≃ 0.665 for mammals using
Heusner’s data with M ≤ 10 kg and rs ≃ −0.42 when
α = 3/4. For the entire range of masses in bird data of
Bennett and Harvey, rs = 0 when α ≃ 0.671.
With these results in hand, we extract f for mam-
mals and birds, the results for mammals being shown
in Figure 3. We ﬁnd the form of f agrees qualitative-
ly with a lognormal.
In order to quantify the quality
of this agreement we employ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov

TABLE IV: Results from Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for the
underlying distributions of ﬂuctuations around pure scaling
for both mammals [28] and birds [29]. The distribution is
assumed to be lognormal, i.e., normal in logarithmic coordi-
nates. The standard deviations σ are calculated directly from
the residuals themselves and determine a level of signiﬁcance
p. The σ∗ correspond to p∗, the maximum p-value possible.

test [50], a non-parametric test which gives a signiﬁ-
cance probability (p-value) for whether or not a sam-
ple comes from a hypothesized distribution. Not having
a hypothesis for the value of the standard deviation, we
take two approaches to deal with this problem. Asserting
the measured sample standard deviation σ to be that of
the underlying normal distribution, we calculate the cor-
responding signiﬁcance probability, p. Alternatively, an
estimate of σ, σ∗, may be obtained by ﬁnding the value
of σ which maximizes p such that p(σ∗) = p∗. Results for
both calculations are found in Table IV. All p-values are
above 0.01, i.e., none show very signiﬁcant deviations.
Additionally, the p-value for only the case of the birds
using σ estimated from the data falls below 0.05 indicat-
ing its departure is signiﬁcant, but this is balanced by
the high p-value found by the maximizing procedure.

Thus, we suggest the data supports the simple hypoth-
esis of lognormal ﬂuctuations around a scaling law with
α ≃ 2/3.

IV. HYPOTHESIS TESTS

We now construct two types of hypothesis tests to
determine whether or not α = 2/3 or α = 3/4 should
be rejected by the available data. The ﬁrst test is the
standard method of testing the results of a linear regres-
sion against a presumed slope. The second is a natural
extension of examining ﬂuctuations about a linear ﬁt as
per the previous section. By analyzing the correlations of
the residuals from the best ﬁt line we are able to quanti-
tatively determine which values of α are compatible with
the data.
In both tests, we reject an hypothesis when
p < 0.01.

A. Comparison to a ﬁxed α

For a given set of N measurements for both mass, Mi,
and metabolic rate, Bi, we pose the following hypotheses:

FIG. 3: Fluctuations in metabolic rate for mammals with
M ≤ 10 kg taken from Heusner’s data set [28]. The scaling
function f (see equation (2)) is ﬁtted with a lognormal distri-
bution. Values of B have been renormalized as B/M 2/3 and
partitioned into 20 bins.

We test the null hypothesis, H0, in the speciﬁc cases α′ =
2/3 and α′ = 3/4 for data from Kleiber [3], Brody [26],
Bennett and Harvey [29], and Heusner [28], over various
mass ranges. Here, the p-value represents the probability
that, given two variables linearly related with slope α′
and subject to Gaussian ﬂuctuations, a data set formed
with N samples would have a measured slope α diﬀering
at least by |α − α′| from α′ [50]. For a null hypothesis
with α = α′, we write the p-value as pα′, e.g., p3/4.
For mammals with M ≤ 10 kg, the results of the
hypothesis test are contained in Table V. The null
hypothesis that α = 3/4 is rejected for both Brody and
Heusner’s data and should not be rejected in the case of
Kleiber. The alternative null hypothesis that α = 2/3 is
not rejected for both Heusner and Kleiber and rejected
in the case of Brody. Again, divisions into mass ranges
are somewhat arbitrary and are chosen to help demon-
strate the mass-dependence of α. For example, for mam-
mals with M < 1 kg, Brody’s data implies we should not
reject the hypothesis that α = 2/3.

Table VI details results for mammals with M ≥ 10
kg. In the smaller data sets of Kleiber and Brody the
hypothesis that α = 3/4 is not rejected while for the
larger data set of Heusner, α = 3/4 is rejected. In all
cases the hypothesis that α = 2/3 for large mammals is
rejected. Even though Brody and Kleiber’s data sets are
consistent with an exponent α > 3/4, the relative lack
of metabolic measurements on large mammals and the

When all mass ranges are considered for both birds
and mammals the hypothesis test (see Table VII) demon-
strates that both α = 2/3 and α = 3/4 are rejected based
on the empirical data on mammals, while α = 2/3 is not
rejected and α = 3/4 is rejected based on the empirical
data on birds. In summary, we ﬁnd that a single exponent
may be appropriate for rough estimates but, from a sta-
tistical point of view, it appears that no single exponent
explains the data on metabolic scaling for mammals.

B. Analysis of residuals

As per our discussion of ﬂuctuations, a sensitive test
of a null hypothesis is to check the rank-correlation coef-
ﬁcient of the residuals. In order to test the hypothesis,
α = α′, we pose the following hypotheses:

H0 : rs,α′ (zi, Mi) = 0,
H1 : rs,α′ (zi, Mi) 6= 0.

FIG. 4: Test of the null hypothesis H0 : rs,α′ (zi, Mi) = 0
based on mammalian data from Heusner [28] (see equa-
tion (5)). Shown are plots of p(α) for diﬀering mass ranges.
In all plots the two dashed horizontal lines correspond to
p = 0.05 and p = 0.01. The individual plots correspond
to the following ranges: (a) M < 3.2 kg, (b) M < 10 kg, (c)
M < 32 kg, (d) all mammals. For all mass ranges considered,
p2/3 > 0.05 and p3/4 ≪ 10−4.

where the zi are the residuals. The hypothesis H0 means
that if the residuals for the power law B = cM α′
are
uncorrelated with M then α′ could be the underlying
exponent. The alternative hypothesis H1 means that the
residual correlations are signiﬁcant and the null hypothe-
sis should be rejected. The p-values represent the proba-
bility that the magnitude of the correlation of the residu-
als, |rs,α′ (zi, Mi)|, would be at least its value as expected
for samples taken from randomly generated numbers.

In this case we have tested the hypothesis for a range
of exponents, α′ = 0.6–0.8, and calculated the signiﬁ-
cance levels for both mammal and bird data compiled by
Heusner [28] and Bennett and Harvey [29], over diﬀer-
ent mass ranges. The results of this hypothesis test for
Heusner’s data is contained in Figure 4 and for Bennett
and Harvey’s data in Figure 5. Both tests show that the
hypothesis α = 3/4 is rejected while that of α = 2/3
is not rejected over all mass ranges considered for both
birds and mammals. This does not mean that α = 2/3 is
the “real” exponent, but rather that it, unlike α = 3/4,
is not incompatible with the data.

McMahon [1] have tried to explain why quarter-power
scaling in body lengths and widths should lead to α =
3/4. Cross-sections of limbs are argued to scale as M 3/4
and therefore the power required to move scales in the
same way. However, it is not clear why the power output
of muscles should be the dominant factor in the scaling of
basal metabolic rate. Furthermore, such quarter-power
scaling for animal shape is not generally observed [2].

Recent debates have focused on deriving α solely from
dimensional analysis [18, 34]. The problem with all
attempts to derive metabolic rate from dimensional anal-
ysis is that diﬀerent constraints lead to diﬀerent choic-
es of contributing scales [18]. Explaining the scaling of
metabolic rate is therefore displaced to biological ques-
tions of energetic constraints, mass density, physiological
time, and diﬀusion constants across surfaces.

FIG. 5: Test of the null hypothesis H0 : rs,α′ (zi, Mi) = 0
based on bird data from Bennett and Harvey [29] (see Fig-
ure 4 for details). Here, the individual plots correspond to the
following ranges: (a) M < 0.1 kg, (b) M < 1 kg, (c) M < 10
kg, (d) all birds. As for the mammal data, p2/3 > 0.05 and
p3/4 ≪ 10−4 for all mass ranges considered.

V. THEORIES

Thus far we have presented empirical evidence that α
is mass dependent and that the null hypothesis α = 2/3
should not be rejected for mammals with M < 10 kg and
all birds in most available data sets. What then of the-
oretical attempts to derive the 3/4-law of metabolism?
We show below that many of these arguments, while
often elegant in conception and based on simple physics
and geometry, contain suﬃcient ﬂaws to render them
unconvincing for the rejection of the simplest theoreti-
cal hypothesis, α = 2/3.

A. Dimensional analysis

Dimensional analysis is a very useful technique when
there is only one mass, length, and time scale in a giv-
en problem. However in the case of metabolic scaling in
biological organisms there has been a long history of the-
oretical debates over which scales to use when predicting
the scaling of metabolic rate via dimensional analysis.

Theories of biological and elastic similarities have been
used to explain many structural aspects of organisms
such as the length and width of major limbs [31, 32, 33].
Using the principles of elastic similarity, Bonner and

Interest in Kleiber’s law resurged with the suggestion
by West, Brown and Enquist (WBE) [22] that nutrient-
supplying networks might be the ubiquitous limiting fac-
tor in organismal form. This remains an appealing and
elegant idea and stands as one of the boldest and most
signiﬁcant attempts at discerning the underlying phys-
ical mechanisms responsible for quarter-power scaling.
Although previous work had addressed the problem of
optimal network structure [52, 53, 54, 55], theoretical
relations between optimal networks and the scaling of
basal metabolic rate had never been considered.

The basic assumptions of WBE are i) homoiotherms
have evolved to minimize the rate at which they dis-
sipate energy; ii) the relevant energy dissipation aris-
es from transport through nutrient-supply networks; iii)
these networks are space-ﬁlling; and iv ) all homoiotherms
possess capillaries invariant in size. From these four
assumptions WBE derive three important conclusions: i)
nutrient-supply networks are fractal; ii) these networks
contain area-preserving branching; and iii) metabolic
rate scales with α = 3/4. However, as we show below
and in Appendices A and B, the arguments used are
mathematically incorrect and as a consequence none of
the above conclusions may be derived from the explicit
assumptions. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd the model appealing
and potentially useful in understanding a number of bio-
logical issues. Thus we detail below where the errors lie
to illuminate the path of future work. For clarity, we use
the same notation as WBE. For each level k in the net-
work hierarchy one has Nk vessels each with length lk and
radius rk with k = 1 being the aorta and k = N being
the capillary level. Related important quantities are nk,
γk and βk, the ratios of number, length and radius from
levels k − 1 to k.

Central to the theory is the connection of these network
ratios to metabolic rate. WBE ﬁnd that nk = n, βk = β

and γk = γ are all constants independent of k and that

α = −

log n
log γβ2 .

(7)

This depends in part on an assumption, which we discuss
below, that B ∝ Nc where Nc is the number of capillaries.
They also conclude that

β = n−1/2

and

γ = n−1/3,

(8)

k = Nk−1r2

which gives α = 3/4 in equation (7). Whereas we show
below that these relations do not arise from an opti-
mization principle, they do have simple interpretations.
The ﬁrst relation corresponds to networks being area-
preserving via Nkr2
k−1. The second rela-
tion follows from a space-ﬁlling criterion that Nkl3
k =
Nk−1l3
k−1. Whether or not space-ﬁlling networks satis-
fy these conditions has been discussed by Turcotte et
al. [56], who consider the more general case of side-
branching networks and arrive at an equivalent statement
of equation (7) where the network ratios β and γ are to
be determined empirically as functions of n.

WBE minimize energy dissipation rate by minimizing
network impedance using a Lagrange multiplier method.
Two types of
impedance are considered: Poiseuille
ﬂow [57] and, for the case of mammals and birds, a more
realistic pulsatile ﬂow [58].

We use the Poiseuille case to demonstrate how frac-
tality is not proven by the minimization procedure. The
impedance is given by

Z =

N
X
k=0

8µlk
πr4
kNk

=

N

(9)

where Zk is the eﬀective impedance of the kth level. As
WBE show, the equations are consistent and Z is mini-
mized when

γk = βk = n−1/3

k

.

(10)

However, the calculations do not require these ratios to
be level-independent, and as a consequence, the network
need not be fractal. Further details may be found in
Appendix A. To see why this is true, we observe that
equations (9) and (10) give

Zk = γkβ−4

k n−1

k Zk−1 = 1 · Zk−1.

(11)

k n−1

Thus, Z, the quantity being minimized, is invariant as
long as γkβ−4
k = 1 for each k. This shows that in this
setting, a network can have nk varying with k and still
be “eﬃcient.” A ﬁnding of fractal networks would have
provided a derivation of Murray’s empirical law which
essentially states that β = n−1/3 for the outer reaches of
the cardiovascular system [59].

Regardless of these issues, the assumption of Poiseuille
ﬂow leads to an approximate metabolic scaling law with
α = 1. WBE suggest that modeling pulsatile ﬂow will

8

provide the explanation for α = 3/4. The impedance
now takes the form

Z ∝

N
X
k=0

h1/2
k√2πr5/2

k Nk

,

(12)

where hk is the thickness of the vessel wall. Howev-
er, as explained in Appendix B, the equations given by
the Lagrange multiplier technique are inconsistent. For
example, the equations give hk = −rk/5 which means
negative wall thicknesses for blood vessels when they are
by deﬁnition positive [58, 60]. If reasonable modiﬁcations
are made to circumvent this issue, then the equations lead
to α = 6/7 rather than α = 3/4.

In order to obtain the scaling α = 3/4 one could aban-
don the minimization calculation and assume a fractal,
space-ﬁlling, area-preserving network where B ∝ Nc. In
support of such an assumption, there is good empirical
evidence that blood systems are well approximated by
fractals [61, 62, 63, 64]. With regards to the assumption
that B ∝ Nc, direct measurements for capillary density
(Nc/M ∝ M α−1) are reported by Hoppeler et al. [65]
with exponents for the scaling of capillary density across
species ranging from −0.21 ± 0.04 to −0.07 ± 0.11 for
various regions of muscle. These numbers are in keep-
ing with higher exponents for the scaling of Nc with M
in the range 0.75–1.00, but whether or not B ∝ Nc is
itself an unproven assumption. It is probably more likely
that the number of capillaries scales with the maximum
metabolic rate which is thought to scale with an expo-
nent closer to unity [66]. At rest not all capillaries diﬀuse
oxygen simultaneously and the limiting factor for basal
metabolic rate might not be Nc.

A simpler and more recent theory based on the idea
of networks has been proposed by Banavar et al. [37].
Here, networks ﬁll D-dimensional hypercubes that have
LD uniformly distributed transfer sites. The theory is
applied to both three-dimensional organisms and two-
dimensional river networks. For organisms, Banavar et
al. ﬁnd blood volume scales as Vb ∝ L(D+1). Since
Banavar et al. further assume that B ∝ LD and that
Vb ∝ M , they conclude that B ∝ M D/(D+1). Thus,
when D = 3, this gives α = 3/4.
However, transfer sites are assumed to be invariant in
size and hence LD appears to be proportional to volume
V consequently M . Thus, both the scalings Vb ∝ M and
Vb ∝ M (D+1)/D are used, creating an apparent incon-
sistency. The scaling of the distance between transfer
sites and the distinction between Euclidean and non-
Euclidean length scales could possibly be clariﬁed to help
resolve the dilemma. Note that Vb ∝ M is supported
empirically [67].

C. Four-dimensional biology

Over two decades ago it was suggested by Blum [35]
that α = 3/4 could be understood by appealing to a sur-
face law of metabolism in a four-dimensional space. In d

dimensions, the “area” A of the hypersurface enclosing a
d . When
d-dimensional hypervolume scales like A ∝ V
d = 4, A ∝ V 3/4, although how this could be reconciled
with our three-dimensional world was not explained and
the theory has been refuted elsewhere [68].

d−1

Recently, an attempt by West et al. [36] has been made
to reﬁne and generalize their earlier work on metabolic
scaling [22] using an optimization procedure to explain
how an eﬀective fourth dimension could yield α = 3/4.
The idea put forward is that organisms have evolved
to maximize the scaling of the eﬀective surface area, a,
across which resources are exchanged. The area a and
the biological volume v are shown to satisfy the relation

a ∝ v(2+ǫa)/(3+ǫv),

(13)

where ǫa and ǫv are exponents to be determined by opti-
mization. West et al. then introduce the relationship
v = al where l is a characteristic length of the organism.
With the further assumption that v ∝ M , equation (13)
then becomes

a ∝ M (2+ǫa)/(3+ǫa+ǫl),

(14)

where ǫl = ǫv − ǫa. With the conditions that 0 ≤ ǫl, ǫa ≤
1, West et al. ﬁnd that ǫa = 1 and ǫl = 0. Equation (14)
then yields a ∝ M 3/4. Assuming a ∝ B, this gives α =
3/4.
However, this result contradicts the geometric fact that
transfer area can maximally scale as volume, i.e., a ∝ v,
which gives α = 1.
Indeed, this result is obtained by
optimizing equation (13) instead of equation (14). Doing
so leads to ǫa = 1 and ǫv = 0, assuming 0 ≤ ǫa, ǫv ≤ 1,
which gives a ∝ M , i.e., α = 1. In order to reconcile this
with the results of West et al., we note that the bounds
0 ≤ ǫl, ǫa, ǫv ≤ 1 are overly restrictive. For example, ǫl =
−1 corresponds to the relevant length l being invariant
with respect to M and, in this case, equation (14) then
gives the same scaling as (13), namely, a ∝ M . Thus, the
contradiction is resolved and the optimization procedure
is seen to yield α = 1 rather than α = 3/4.

9

of α = 3/4. Subsequently, α = 3/4 has often been tak-
en as fact despite the absence of a comprehensive theo-
ry and contradictory evidence from large literature sur-
veys. Most prominent among these surveys are those by
Bartels [30], Bennett and Harvey [29], and Heusner [28],
which suggest that α depends on body size and taxonom-
ic level.

We have re-analyzed some of the most inﬂuential
empirical data sets in the study of metabolic rate scal-
ing. We have constructed a set of hypothesis tests which
show that in the data sets of Kleiber, Brody, Bennett and
Harvey, and Heusner, pure 3/4-law scaling is not present.
For both mammals with M ≤ 10 kg and all birds we
are unable to reject the null hypothesis α = 2/3. For
mammals with M ≥ 10 kg, systematic deviations from
α = 2/3 appear to be present in all of the data sets,
the roots of which might simply be a consequence of a
change in body shape for large mammals or might point
to a greater evolutionary advantage of large mammals.

We have also reviewed historic and recent attempts to
justify α = 3/4 theoretically. Many of the early eﬀorts
to explain the scaling of metabolic rates via dimension-
al analysis and other crude scaling techniques have been
dismissed in the past. Although recent attempts to link
metabolic rates to network structure are noteworthy they
do not prove the stated conclusions. Nonetheless, we
believe that research exploring the role of geometric form
and the dynamics of growth in constraining the behavior
of networks might lead to important progress in organis-
mal biology.

Stated simply, after a systematic review of the avail-
able empirical data and theoretical arguments, we ﬁnd no
compelling evidence of a simple scaling law for metabolic
rate, and if it were to exist, we also ﬁnd no compelling
evidence that the exponent should be α = 3/4.

VI. DISCUSSION

The possibility that there might be a simple law to
explain the scaling of metabolic rates still captures the
imagination of many seeking to understand what Kleiber
called “the ﬁre of life” [4]. It is perhaps for this reason
that so many researchers, theorists and empiricists alike,
have struggled to deduce explanations for the deviations
from the simplest expectation that α = 2/3.

The shift from α = 2/3 to α = 3/4 began with the ear-
ly work by Kleiber and Brody who found α ≃ 0.72–0.73
in limited data sets [3, 26]. Afterwards it was work by
Hemmingsen [23] and a general consensus among practi-
tioners [21] that simple fractions would be a more con-
venient standard that led to the widespread acceptance

to lie in the fact that the auxiliary function Fm in equa-

The calculations are seen to be consistent and yield

subtle since N = N (M ) and provide higher order correc-
tions. However, one of WBE’s crucial results, nk = n,
i.e. that the network is fractal, has not been reproduced.
One way to see this is to consider the impedance as
impedances in series:

(A9)

(A17)

since rc and lc are assumed to be independent of mass and
Nc is the number of capillaries. This is true regardless of
whether or not the structure is fractal. The network has
to possess branching ratios that collectively maintain the
same impedance from level to level (i.e., γk/β4
knk = 1 as
per equation (A16)) but there is no requirement that the
individual ratios γk, βk and nk be independent of level.
Moreover, without the result that the network is fractal,
this minimization procedure no longer yields the power
law scaling of metabolic rate (see equation (7)).

APPENDIX B: NETWORK OPTIMIZATION

CALCULATION FOR PULSATILE FLOW

In the case of Poiseuille ﬂow, WBE ﬁnd a network
structure where area preservation is not satisﬁed (βk 6=
n−1/2
) and, eﬀectively, α = 1 (if nk = n is assumed).
k
The intended ﬁx is to properly treat pulsatile ﬂow of
mammalian blood circulation systems. By doing so we
should obtain βk = n−1/2
. Together
with the assumption nk = n, this leads to the conclusion,
Nc ∝ M 3/4, and assuming B ∝ Nc, it would imply a 3/4-
law of metabolic scaling.
The calculation relies on the results of Womersley’s
work on pulsatile ﬂow [58, 60]. Womersley’s calculations
lead to a modiﬁcation of the Poiseuille impedance. For
large tubes one has

where co = (Eh/2ρr)1/2 is the Korteweg-Moens velocity,
E is Young’s modulus, h is the thickness of the vessel
wall, ρ is blood density and r is, as before, the vessel
radius [58, 60]. This impedance appears to be per unit
length but it has the correct dimensions showing that
for a ﬂow with pulsatile forcing in an elastic tube, the
impedance is independent of the tube length.

Note that the extra variable of wall thickness, hk, has
been included in the second term to make it a measure
of the total volume taken up by the blood system. The
variable hk must appear in the constraints if the mini-
mization is to make any sense and the blood volume is
the only reasonable choice—the blood volume constraint
becomes a network volume constraint.

On considering variations of equation (B2) with

respect to rj and hj we obtain

∂Fw
∂rj

(Ehjρ)1/2

√2πh1/2

j

+ λ2π(rj + hj)ljNj = 0.

(B4)

Since the second term of these equations are the same
we then have an equality between the ﬁrst terms which
simpliﬁes to show that

hj = −

rj.

(B5)

This suggests that rk is the distance to the outer wall of
blood vessels. We are then measuring the blood volume
as before and we should have had (rk − hk) instead of
(rk +hk) in the auxiliary function. However it is apparent
from Womersley’s work [58, 60] that r is the radius as
measured from the center to the inner wall of a blood
vessel rather than the outer wall. There appears to be
no reasonable and simple way of including the hk into a
constraint function and we have an ill-posed problem.

Nevertheless, we may proceed with the calculation by
adding an extra assumption that hk = a0rk where a0 > 0.
The modiﬁed version of equation (B3) now gives λ as

λ =

(a0Eρ)1/2
√2π2(1 + a0)2r4

(B6)

Since the right hand side is independent of j we must
therefore have

j γj = 1,

(B7)

and given the space-ﬁlling constraint, γj = n−1/3
obtain

A further complication here is that the equations
obtained by setting ∂Fw/∂lj = 0 and ∂Fw/∂Nj = 0 are
not consistent.

As in the case of Poiseuille ﬂow, nk = n is not deriv-
able. Assuming that nk = n and using equation (7) we
ﬁnd that the metabolic exponent should be

α = −

ln n
ln γβ2 = −

ln n

ln n−1/3n−10/12 = 6/7,

(B10)

as opposed to the stated 3/4.

Note that if we had found βk = n1/2

then the 3/4
law would have been deduced (again, assuming nk =
n). Another observation here is that if the Womersley

k

k

impedance is taken together with βk = n−1/2
then we
ﬁnd that the minimum total impedance is obtained irre-
spective of the ratios nk being equal or not. So, in the cas-
es of Poiseuille and pulsatile ﬂow a fractal network is not
necessary for energy dissipation to be minimized. Addi-
tionally, in the case of a pulsatile ﬂow network, α = 3/4
cannot be derived from the optimization problem as stat-
ed. It may instead be derived by assuming an area pre-
serving, space-ﬁlling, fractal network where B ∝ Nc.

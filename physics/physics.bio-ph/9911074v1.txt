Abstract

Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is used to investigate the elasticity

of torsionally stressed double-stranded DNA, in which twist and supercoiling

are incorporated as a natural result of base-stacking interaction and backbone

bending constrained by hydrogen bonds formed between DNA complementary

nucleotide bases. Three evident regimes are found in extension versus torsion

and/or force versus extension plots: a low-force regime in which over- and un-

derwound molecules behave similarly under stretching; an intermediate-force

regime in which chirality appears for negatively and positively supercoiled

DNA and extension of underwound molecule is insensitive to the supercoil-

ing degree of the polymer; and a large-force regime in which plectonemic

DNA is fully converted to extended DNA and supercoiled DNA behaves quite

like a torsionless molecule. The striking coincidence between theoretic calcu-

lations and recent experimental measurement of torsionally stretched DNA

[Strick et al., Science 271, 1835 (1996), Biophys. J. 74, 2016 (1998)] strongly

suggests that the interplay between base-stacking interaction and permanent

hydrogen-bond constraint takes an important role in understanding the novel

properties of elasticity of supercoiled DNA polymer.

Introduction

Recent years have witnessed a remarkably intense experimental and theoretical activity in

searching for the elasticity of a single supercoiled DNA molecule (see, e.g. Strick et al., 1996,

1998; Fain et al., 1997; Vologodskii and Marko, 1997; Moroz and Nelson, 1997; Bouchiat

and Mezard, 1998, Zhou et al., 1999). Within a cell, native double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)

often exists as a twisted, and heavily coiled, closed circle. Diﬀering amount of supercoiling,

in addition to aﬀecting the packing of DNA within cells, inﬂuences the activities of proteins

that participate in processes — such as DNA replication and transcription — that require

the untwisting of dsDNA (Wu et al., 1988). It is believed that changes in supercoiling can

also promote changes in DNA secondary structure that inﬂuences the binding of proteins

and other ligands (Morse and Simpson, 1988).

In recent experiments (Strick et al., 1996, 1998) on single torsionally constrained DNA

molecule, it was found that the supercoiling remarkably inﬂuences the mechanical property

of DNA molecules. When applied with relatively low stretching force, a supercoiled molecule

can reduce its torque by writhing, forming structures known as plectonemes. Therefore, the

distance between two ends of the polymer decreases with increasing supercoiling. But above

a certain critical force fc, this dependence of extension on supercoiling disappears. More

strikingly, the value of fc is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for positively and negatively supercoiled

DNA, i.e. fc ∼ 0.8pN for underwound molecule and fc ∼ 4.5pN for overwound ones. On

the theoretical side, harmonic twist elasticity and bending energy according to the wormlike

chain model have been used to understand supercoiling of DNA polymer (Fain et al., 1997;

Vologodskii and Marko, 1997; Moroz and Nelson, 1997; Bouchiat and Mezard, 1998), and

some qualitative mechanic features of plectonemic structures of supercoiled DNA polymer

have been described by the harmonic twist elasticity. But because of the chiral symmetry

of harmonic twist elasticity, the asymmetry of elastic behaviors of supercoiled DNA can not

be understood by this model, and especially the three obvious mechanic regimes observed in

experiment of supercoiling DNA (Strick et al., 1996, 1998) still need better understanding.

To understand the supercoiling property as well as the highly extensibility of DNA, we

have developed a more realistic model in which the double-stranded nature of DNA is taken

1

into account explicitly (Zhou et al., 1999). The supercoiling property of highly extended

DNA was investigated analytically. Here, we aim at performing a thorough and systematic

investigation into the property of supercoiled DNA by using Monte Carlo simulations based

on this model.

As we have known, the bending energy of DNA polymer is mainly associated with the

covalent bonding between neighboring atoms of DNA backbone (Nossel and Lecar, 1991). In

our previous work (Zhou et al., 1999), van der Waals interactions between adjacent basepairs

was introduced and this helps to explain the highly cooperative extensibility of overstretched

DNA (Cluzel et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). And it has been shown that the short-range

base-stacking interaction takes a signiﬁcant role in determining the elastical property of

DNA. Lennard-Jones type potential between adjacent basepairs can be written as

ǫ[( cos θ0

cos θ )12 − 2( cosθ0
ǫ[cos12 θ0 − 2 cos6 θ0],

cos θ )6], for θ > 0,

for θ ≤ 0,

U(θ) =

(see also Fig. 1). The folding angle θ of the sugar-phosphate backbones around DNA central

axis is associated with the steric distance r of adjacent basepairs by r = r0 cos θ, where r0

is the backbone arclength between adjacent bases. The asymmetric potential related to

positive and negative folding angle θ in Fig. 1 ensures a native DNA to take a right-handed

double-helix conﬁguration with its equilibrium folding angle θeq ∼ θ0. This double-helix

structure is anticipated to be very stable since ǫ (∼ 14 kBT ) is much higher than thermal

energy kBT according to the results of quantum chemical calculations (Saenger, 1984).

In case that DNA polymer is torsionally constrained, the basepair folding angle will

deviate from the equilibrium position θeq. However, if the stretching force is very small, the

folding angle may deviate from θeq only slightly. This is because of the following reason:

As we can infer from Fig. 1, the base-stacking potential is very sharp around θ0, and a

relatively large force is needed to make θ deviate considerably from its equilibrium value.

It is reasonable for us to anticipate that a supercoiled DNA under low stretching force will

convert its excess or deﬁcit linking number into positive or negative writhing of its central

axis. Since the central axis is symmetric with respect to positive or negative writhing, the

2

elastic response of DNA at this force regime will certainly be symmetric with positive or

negative degree of supercoiling. Only when the stretching force becomes large enough will

the chirality of supercoiled DNA appear. In this regime, it becomes more and more diﬃcult

for the central axis to writhe to absorb linking number and an increasing portion of the

linking number will be converted to twisting number of the backbones, which will certainly

changes the twisting manner of dsDNA. Since Eq. 1 shows that for dsDNA untwisting is

much easier than overtwisting, chiral behavior is anticipated to emerge. This opinion is

consistent with the experimental result of Strick et al. (1996).

In this paper, we investigate the mechanical properties of supercoiled DNA by numerical

Monte Carlo method. Base-stacking van der Waals interactions between adjacent basepairs

are incorporated by introducing the new degree of freedom, namely the folding angle θ.

A fundamental diﬀerence from the previous approaches (See, e.g., Vologodskii and Marko,

1997), which try to include the twist degrees of freedom by adding extra terms to the free

energy, is that the twist and supercoiling are treated as the cooperative result of base-stacking

and backbones bending constrainted from permanent basepairs. The striking coincidence

between theoretic calculations and experimental data of supercoiling DNA (Stick et al.,

1996, 1998) indeed conﬁrms this treatment.

Model and method of calculation

In the simulation, the double-stranded DNA molecule is modeled as a chain of discrete

cylinders, or two discrete wormlike chains constrained by basepairs of ﬁxed length 2R (Fig.

2). The conformation of DNA molecule of N straight cylinder segments is speciﬁed by the

space positions of vertices of its central axis, ri = (x(i), y(i), z(i)) in 3-D Cartesian coordinate

system, and the folding angle of the sugar-phosphate backbones around the central axis,

θi, i = 1, 2, · · · , N. Each segment is assigned the same amount of basepairs, nbp, so that the

length of the ith segment satisﬁes

∆si = |ri − ri−1| = 0.34nbp

cos θi
hcos θi0

,

(2)

3

where h· · ·i0 means the thermal average for a relaxed DNA molecule. Moreover, bearing in

mind the experimental fact that there are about 10.5 basepairs for each turn of a native

double helix DNA and the average distance between the adjacent basepairs is about d0 =

0.34nm, we have set the basepair length as 2R = (10.5d0/π)htan θi0 in our model.

Metropolis Monte Carlo method (Metropolis et al., 1953) is used to simulate the equi-

librium evolution procedure of torsionally stretched dsDNA molecule. At each step of the

simulation procedure, a trial conformation of the chain is generated by a movement from the

previous one. The starting conﬁguration is chosen arbitrarily (except that some topology

and bound conditions should be satisﬁed, see below) and the averaged results of equilibrium

ensemble are independent of the initial choice after numerous movements. The probability

of acceptance of the movement depends on the diﬀerence in energy between the trial and

the current conformations, according to the Boltzmann weight. When a trial movement is

rejected, the current conformation should be counted once more. This procedure is repeated

numerous times to obtain an ensemble of conformations that, in principle, is representative

of the equilibrium distribution of DNA conformation.

The DNA model

As we have known, double strand DNA is formed by winding two polynucleotide back-

bones right-handedly around a common central axis. Between the backbones nucleotide

basepairs are formed with the formation of hydrogen bonds between complementary bases.

In our continuous model (Zhou et al., 1999), the embeddings of two backbones are deﬁned

by r1(s) and r2(s′). The ribbon structure of DNA is enforced by having r2(s′) separated

from r1(s) by a distance 2R, i.e. r2(s′) = r1(s) + 2Rb(s) where the hydrogen-bond-director

unit vector b(s) points from r1(s) to r2(s′). As the result of the wormlike backbones, the

bending energy of two backbones can be written as

the same time they hinder considerably the bending freedom of DNA central axis because

4

of the strong steric eﬀect. In the assumption of permanent hydrogen bonds (Everaers et

al., 1995; Liverpool et al., 1998; Zhou et al, 1999), |s′ − s| = 0. The relative sliding

of backbones is prohibited and the basepair orientation lies perpendicular to the tangent

vectors t1 = dr1/ds and t2 = dr2/ds of the two backbones and that of the central axis, t:

b · t1 = b · t2 = b · t = 0. By deﬁning the folding angle as half of the rotation angle from

t2(s) to t1(s), i.e., the intersection angle between tangent vector of backbones t1(2) and DNA

central axis t, we have

Therefore, the bending energy of the two backbones can be rewritten as

t1 = cos θ t + sin θ b × t

t2 = cos θ t − sin θ b × t.

where ds denotes arc-length element of the backbones, L the total contour length of each

backbone, and κ is the persistence length of one DNA backbone. Bearing in mind that

the pairing and stacking enthalpy of the bases signiﬁcantly increase bending stiﬀness of

polymer axis, the experimental value of persistent length of dsDNA polymer is considerably

larger than that of a DNA single strand (See, e.g. Smith et al., 1996). To incorporate

the steric eﬀect and also considering the typical experiment value of persistent length of

dsDNA p = 53nm, the simpliest way is to substitute k in the ﬁrst term of Eq. 5 with a

phenomenological parameter κ∗ = 53.0/2hcos θi0nmkBT (Zhou et al., 1999), hereafter this

is assumed.

Taking into account Eqs. 1 and 5, the total energy of dsDNA molecule with N segments

where γi is the bending angle between the (i − 1)th and the ith segments (Fig. 2), Nbp the

central axis along the direction of the external force f (assumed in the z-direction).

Since Kuhn statistical length of dsDNA polymer is associated with its bending stiﬀness

(the Kuhn length is twice as persistence length of dsDNA polymer according to the wormlike

chain model), one can decide bending rigidity parameter α of the discrete chain accordingly.

Suppose that we take the N discrete segments to simulate the behaviors of a dsDNA polymer

of n Kuhn statistical length, the length of m(= N/n) segments should correspond to one

Kuhn statistical length. Therefore, for any chosen value m, we can decide the bending

rigidity parameter α in the way (see Appendix)

where

hcos γi = R

.

In principle, the discrete DNA model becomes continuous only when m approaches

inﬁnity. The CPU time needed for a simulation, however,

increases approximately as

N 2 = (nm)2. So it is necessary to choose a value of m that is large enough to ensure

reliable results but small enough to keep the computational time within reasonable bounds.

Our calculation and also previous work (Vologoskii et al., 1992) showed that simulated

properties do not depend on m if it exceeds 8. Therefore, m = 8 was used in the current

calculation, for which the bending constant α = 1.895kBT . Furthermore, we have chosen

N = 160 in consideration of the feasible computer time. Since Kuhn statistical length of

dsDNA is taken as 106nm, the B-form length of the polymer in our simulation corresponds

to LB = 2120nm or 6234 base-pairs. The constant α′ in the second term of Eq. 6 should

be associated with stiﬀness of the DNA single strand. As an crude approximation, we have

taken here α′ = α = 1.895kBT .1

The fourth term in Eq. 6 accounts for van der Waals interactions between adjacent

basepairs (see Eq. 1). θ0 (= 62◦) is related to the equilibrium distance between a DNA

1 Our unpublished data show that, the amount of second term of Eq. 6 is quite small compared

with other four terms. And the result of simulation is not sensitive to α′.

dimer. The base-stacking intensity ǫ is generally inﬂuenced by composition and sequence

of nucleotide chains. For example, the solubility experiments in biphasic systems show that

stacking interactions between purine and pyrimidine bases follow the trend

purine − purine > pyrimidine − purine > pyrimidine − pyrimidine.

Since we do not distinguish the speciﬁc base-sequence of purine and pyrimidine in our DNA

model, we take statistic average of stack energies as ǫ = 14kBT , according to the result of

quantum chemical calculations (Saenger, 1984).

To simulate the extension of the stretched DNA chain, we ﬁxed one of its ends at original

point in 3-D Cartesian system and applied a force f directed along the z axis to the second

end, which corresponds to the ﬁfth term of Eq. 6.

Calculation of link number

The number of times the two strands of DNA double helix are interwound, i.e., the link

number Lk, is a topologic invariant quantity for closed DNA molecule and also for linear

DNA polymer in case that the orientations of two extremities of the linear polymer are

ﬁxed and any part of polymer is forbidden to go round the extremities of the polymer. An

unstressed B-DNA molecule has one right-handed twist per 3.4nm along its length, i.e.,

Lk0 = LB/3.4. Under some twist stress, the link number of DNA polymer may be diﬀerent

from its torsionally relexed value. In all case when ∆Lk = Lk − Lk0 6= 0, the DNA polymer

is called “supercoiled” (Vologodskii and Cozzarelli, 1994). The relative diﬀerence in link

number

σ =

Lk − Lk0
Lk0

(9)

signiﬁes the degree of supercoiling which is independent upon the length of DNA polymer.

The native DNA of organisms living at physiological environment are found always slightly

underwound and its supercoiling degree is between −0.03 and −0.09 (Bauer, 1978; Volo-

godskii and Cozzarelli, 1994), which is believed signiﬁcantly relevant in some fundamental

biological processes (Wu et al., 1988; Morse and Simpson, 1988).

7

In addition to counting directly the number of times the two strands are interwound,

the link number of closed DNA circle can be conveniently calculated by White’s theorem

(White 1969)

Lk = T w + W r.

(10)

(11)

The twist T w is the number of times basepair twist around central axis and does not depend

upon the conﬁguration of molecule axis. The writhe W r of molecule is a simple function of

only the molecule axis vector r(s) (White, 1969; Fuller, 1971)

W r =

1
4π Z Z

dsds′ ∂sr(s) × ∂s′r(s′) · [r(s) − r(s′)]

.

|r(s) − r(s′)|3

W r is scale invariant and dimensionless and changes sign under reﬂection or inversion of r,

reﬂecting the cross product in the formula above. Therefore W r = 0 if r(s) is planar or

otherwise reﬂection symmetric.

In order to control and measure experimentally the supercoiling degree of linear DNA

polymer, Strick et al. (1996, 1998) attached one end of DNA molecule to a glass cover slip

by DIG-anti-DIG links and other end to a paramagnetic bead by biotin-streptavidin links.

Bearing in mind the diameter of magnetic bead (≈ 4.5µm) is far beyond that of polymer,

the anchoring points can be considered as on impenetrable walls and ∼ 16-µm-long DNA

(Strick et al., 1996) in fact is prohibited to pass around the ends of the polymer. A magnetic

ﬁeld pointing in the plane of the microscope slide was applied to ﬁx the orientation of the

bead. Therefore, by rotating the magnets and counting the time of turns, the link number

Lk of the linear DNA molecule can be controlled and measured experimentally.

In Monte Carlo calculations, we restrict the DNA chain by two impenetrable parallel walls

crossing the chain ends which is to simulate the above mentioned experimental equipment

of the magnet bead and the microscope slide (see also the treatment in Vologodskii and

Marko, 1997). The walls are always parallel to xy plane in our Cartian coordinate system

and thus perpendicular to the direction of the force applied to the chain ends.

One way to calculate the link number Lk of DNA molecule in our Monte Carlo simulation

is to use the White’s formula Eq. 10. However, the writhe W r is deﬁned only for closed

8

chain.

In order to solve the problem, we add three long ﬂat ribbons to the two ends of

the DNA chain in each conformation during the simulation procedure. The axes of these

ribbons are kept in the same planar and consist a closed circle together with the linear DNA

chain. Since there is no any twist in the added three ﬂat ribbons, it is not diﬃcult to verify

from Fig. 3 that the number of times two strands interwind Lkl in Fig. 3a is equal to the

link number of new closed polymer Lkc in Fig. 3d. Therefore, we only calculate Lk of the

closed chain in our simulations according to Eqs. 10 and 11.

Quite similar to the model by Tan and Harvey (1989) in which the twist of each base-pair

of DNA chain is explicitly speciﬁed, the folding angle of backbones in each segments has

been given in our model. So the twist can be directly calculated by

T w =

∆si tan θi.

(12)

The writhe W r of the new DNA circle can be calculated according to Eq. 11.

Simulation procedure

For any given force, equilibrium sets of conformations of DNA chain are constructed

using the Metropolis MC procedure (Metropolis et al., 1953). Three kinds of movements

have been considered in our simulations (see Fig. 4).

In the ﬁrst type of movement, a random chosen segment is undertwisted or overtwisted

by an angle λ1. In other words, the folding angle θi of the chosen segment is modiﬁed into

a new value θ′

i = θi + λ1. When θ′

i is beyond the setting interval [−θm, θm] from one side,

it will re-enter the interval from the opposite side according to the periodicity assumption.

Although the geometric limit of folding angle of DNA backbone is θm = π/2, we set θm = 85o

here to avoid the possible divergency in numerical calculation of potential of Eq. 1. It should

be mentioned that, this movement modiﬁes not only the folding angle of the chosen segment

but also the coordinates of all the behind vertices rj, j = i, · · · , N along the length, since

when the folding angle θi is changed we have also changed the length of the segment ∆si

according to Eq. 2. So we should translate all those segments behind this one to make the

chain match up (Fig. 4a).

9

In the second type of movement, an interval subchain containing arbitrary amount of

segments will be rotated by an angle of λ2 around the straight line connecting the vertices

bounding the subchain (Fig. 4b). The third type of movement involves a rotation of the

subchain between a chosen vertices and the free end by an angle of λ3, around an axis with

arbitrary orientation (Fig. 4c). All three types of movements satisfy the basic require-

ment of the Metropolis procedure of microscopic reversibility, i.e. the probability of trial

conformation B when current conformation is A must be equal to the probability of trial

conformation A when current conformation is B.

All three types of movements change the conﬁgurations of DNA chain. But from the

viewpoint of energy, their functions are quite diﬀerent. While the ﬁrst type of movement

concerns mainly with modifying twist and stacking energy, the second one changes only the

bending energy and the third modiﬁes both bending energy and extension of DNA chain.

Each of them is performed in the probability of 1/3. The value of λ1, λ2, λ3 are uniformly

distributed over interval (−λ0

1, λ0

1), (−λ0

2, λ0

2) and (−λ0

3, λ0

3) respectively, and λ0

1, λ0

2 and λ0
3

are chosen to guarantee that about half of the trial moves of each type are accepted.

The starting conformation of DNA chain is unknotted. But the conﬁgurations after

numerous steps of movements may become knotted, which violates the topologic invariance

of chain and is incorporeal. Especially, both ends of molecule are anchored in the experiment

and knots never occur. In order to avoid knotted conﬁguration, we should check the knot

status for each trial conformation. The most eﬀective way to clarify the knot categories of

DNA circle is to calculate its Jones polynomial (Jones, 1985), which is strictly topological

invariant for knot categories. But the computational calculation of Jones polynomial is quite

prolix at this moment. In our case that it is only necessary to distinguish between unknot

and knot categories, the classical Alexander polynomial (Alexander, 1928; Conway, 1969)

is enough to meet this requirement although it is of weaker topological invariants and does

not distinguish mirror images. For trivial knot, Alexander polynomial ∆(t) = 1; and ∆(t) is

10

usually not equal to 1 for knotted chain.2 Convenient algorithms for computer calculation

of Alexander polynomial had been well built (see, e.g. Vologodskii et al. 1974; Harris and

Harvey, 1999). We only calculate the value of ∆(−1) in our simulation. In case that the

trial movement knots the chain, the energy of trial conformation is set to be inﬁnite, i.e. it

will be rejected.

Another interaction considered in our simulation is the steric eﬀect of polymer chain.

Since the segment has ﬁnite volume, other segments cannot come into its own space region.

This interaction evidently swells the polymer (Doi and Edwards, 1986). To incorporate

this exclude-volume eﬀect into our simulation, for each trial conformation, we calculate the

distance of between any point on the axis of a segment and any point on the axis of another

non-adjacent segment and check whether this distance is less than the DNA diameter 2R.

If the minimum distance for any two chosen segments is less than 2R, the energy of trial

conformation is set inﬁnite and the movement is rejected.

During the evolution of DNA chain, the supercoiling degree σ may distribute around

all the possible values. In order to avoid the waste of computation events, we bound the

supercoiling σ of DNA chain inside the experimental region (Strick et al., 1996, 1998), i.e.

−0.12 ≥ σ ≥ 0.12. When the torsion degree of trial conformation is beyond the chosen

range, we simply neglect the movement and reproduce a new trial movement again.

Result of Monte Carlo simulation

To obtain equilibrium ensemble of DNA evolution, 107 elementary displacements are

produced for each chosen applied force f . The relative extension x and supercoiling degree

σ of each accepted conformation of DNA chain are calculated. When the trial movement is

rejected, the current conformation is count up twice (see Metropolis et al., 1953).

2 Although there are nontrivial knots whose Alexander polynomials equal unity, this case is very

rare. One of the example for nontrivial knot with ∆(t) = 1 can be found in Vologodskii et al.

(1974).

11

In order to see the dependence of mechanics property of DNA upon supercoiling degree,

the whole sample is partitioned into 15 subsamples according to the value of the supercoiling

degree σ. For each subsample, we calculate the averaged extension

where Nj is the number of movements supercoiling of which belong to jth subsample.

We display the force versus relation extension for all positive and negative supercoiling

in Fig. 5a and c respectively. As a comparison, the experimental data (Strick et al., 1998)

are shown in Fig. 5b and d.

In Fig. 6 is shown the averaged extension as a function

of supercoiling degree for 3 typical applied forces. At low force, the extension in our MC

simulation saturates at a value greater than zero because of the impenetrable walls which

astrict the vertical coordinate of the free end always higher than that of any other points of

the DNA chain. The same eﬀect of the impenetrable walls was found in earlier works (see

Fig. 9 of the paper by Vologodskii and Marko, 1997). For conciseness, we did not show the

points the relative extension of which is less than 0.15 in Fig. 5 and 6.

In spite of quantitative diﬀerence between Monte Carlo results and experimental data,

the qualitative coincidence is striking. Especially, three evident regimes exist in both exper-

imental data and our Monte Carlo simulations:

i). At a low force, the elastic behaviour of DNA is symmetrical under positive or negative

supercoiling. This is understandable, since the DNA torsion is the cooperative result

of hydrogen-bond constrained bending of DNA backbones and the base-stacking in-

teraction in our model. At very low force, the contribution from applied force and

the thermodynamic ﬂuctuation perturbate the folding angle θ of basepair to derive

very little from the equilibrium position θ0. Therefore, the DNA elasticity is achiral

at this region (see the Introduction part of this paper). For a ﬁxed applied force, the

12

increasing torsion stress tends to produce plectonemic state which shorten the distance

of two ends, therefore, the relative extension of linear DNA polymer. These features

can be also understood by the traditional approaches with harmonic twist and bending

elasticity (Vologodskii and Marko, 1997; Bouchiat and Mezard, 1998).

ii). At intermediate force, the folding angle of basepairs are pulled slightly further away

from equilibrium value θ0 where van der Waals potential is not symmetric around

θ0. So the chiral nature of elasticity of the DNA molecule appears.

In negative

supercoiling region, i.e. θ < θ0, the contribution of applied force dominates that

of potential because of the low plateaus of U(θ). So the extension is insensitive to

negative supercoiling degree. On the other hand, the positive supercoiling still tends

to contract the molecule.

iii). At higher force, the contribution of the applied force to the energy dominates that of

van der Waals potential in both over- and underwound DNA. The extension of DNA

accesses to its B-form length. Therefore, the plectonemic DNA is fully converted to

extended DNA, the writhe is essentially entirely converted to twist and the force-

extension behaviour reverts to that of untwisted (σ = 0) DNA as expected from a

torsionless worm-like chain model (Smith et al., 1992; Marko and Siggia, 1995; Zhou

et al., 1999). Because of the eﬀect of impenetrable wall, however, the extension of

DNA molecule in our calculation is slightly higher than experimental data.

In conclusion, the elasticity of supercoiled double-stranded DNA is investigated by Monte

Carlo simulations. In stead of introducing an extra twist energy term, twist and supercoiling

are leaded into as a nature result of cooperative interplay between base-stacking interac-

tion and sugar-phosphate backbones bending constrained by permanent hydrogen bonds.

Without any adjustable parameter, the theoretic results on the correlations among DNA

extension, supercoiling degree and applied force agree qualitatively to recent experimental

data by Strick et al (1996, 1998).

It should be mentioned that there is an up-limit of supercoiling degree for extended

13

DNA in current model, i.e. σmax ∼ 0.14, which corresponds to θ = 90o of folding angle.

In recent experiments, Allemand et al.

(1998) twisted the plasmid up to the range of

−5 < σ < 3. They found that at this “unrealistically high” supercoiling, the curves of force

versus extension for diﬀerent σ split again at higher stretch force (> 3pN). As argued by

Allemand et al. (1998), in the extremely under- and overwound torsion stress, two new

DNA forms, denatured-DNA and P-DNA with exposed bases, will appear. In fact, if the

deviation of the angle which speciﬁes DNA twist from its equilibrium value exceeds some

threshold, the corresponding torsional stress causes local distraction of the regular double

helix structure (Vologodskii and Cozzarelli, 1994). So the emergence of these two striking

forms is essentially associated with the broken processes of some basepairs under super-

highly torsional stress.

In this case, the permanent hydrogen constrain will be violated

and the conﬁguration of base stacking interactions be varied considerably. We hope, with

incorporation of these eﬀects at high supercoiling degree, our model should reproduce the

novel elastic behaviour of DNA. This part of work is in progress.

Appendix: Kuhn Statistical Length of Discrete Chain

Let us consider a discrete chain of N segments with each of length l0, the end-to-end

vector of which is written as

where ti =

Ri−Ri−1
|Ri−Ri−1|.

R ≡ l0

(15)

For chains with bending stiﬀness, e.g. the DNA model described in Eq. 6, hti+k · tii does

not vanish for k 6= 0. ti+k can be expressed relatively to i + k − 1’th segment as

ti+k = cos γi+k−1ti+k−1 + sin γi+k−1ni+k−1,

(16)

where γi+k−1 is the bending angle between i + k − 1’th and i + k’th segments as deﬁned

in Eq. 6, and ni+k−1 is the unit vector coplanar with ti+k and ti+k−1 but perpendicular to

the latter. If the average of ti+k is taken with the rest of the chain (i.e., ti, ti+1, · · · , ti+k−1)

ﬁxed, one obtains

hti+kiti,ti+1,···,ti+k−1ﬁxed = hcos γi+k−1iti+k−1,

(17)

since hni+k−1iti,ti+1,···,ti+k−1ﬁxed = 0 according to Eq.6. Multiplying both sides of Eq. 17 by

ti and taking the average over ti, ti+1, · · · , ti+k−1, one has

hti+k · tii = hcos γihti+k−1 · tii,

where hcos γi is not speciﬁc to segments and given by Eq. 8. This recursion equation, with

the initial condition t2 = 1, is solved by

Thus for large N, hR2i is given by

hti+k · tii = hcos γik.

Therefore, Kuhn statistical length of the discrete chain can be written as

where Rmax is the maximum length of the end-to-end vector.

FIG. 2. The conﬁguration of discrete DNA chain in our model.

FIG. 3. The schematic diagram to calculate link number in our simulations. (a). For a linear

supercoiled DNA chain with one end attached to a microscope slide and with another end attached

to a magnetic bead, when the orientation of the bead is ﬁxed and the DNA chain is forbidden to go

round the bead, the number of times for two strands to interwind each other, the linking number of

the linear DNA (Lkl), is a topological constant. (b). The DNA double helix is stretched to a fully

extended form while the orientation of bead keeps unchanged. The link number of linear DNA

chain is equal to the twist number, i.e. Lkl = T wl. (c). Three long ﬂat ribbons are connected to the

two ends of the linear twisted DNA of (b). The link number of the new double helix circle is equal

to that of linear DNA chain, i.e. Lkc = T wc = T wl = Lkl since the writhe of the rectangle loop is

0. (d). The DNA circle in (c) can be deformed into a new circle, one part of which has the same

steric structure as the linear supercoiled DNA chain in (a). So by adding three straight ribbons,

the link number of linear double helix DNA can be obtained by calculating the link number of the

new DNA circle, i.e. Lkl = Lkc = T w + W r.

FIG. 4. Trial motions of the DNA chain during Monte Carlo simulations. The current confor-

mation of DNA central axis is shown by solid lines and the trial conformation by dashed lines. (a).

The folding angle in ith segment θi is changed into θi + λ1. All segments between ith vertex and

the free end are translated by the distance of |∆si − ∆s′

i|. (b). A portion of the chain is rotated by

an angle of λ2 around the axis connecting the two ends of rotated chain. (c). The segments from a

randomly chosen vertex to the free end are rotated by an angle λ3 around an arbitrary orientation

axis which passes the chosen vertex.

Abstract

We study the energestics of a thermal motor driven by temperature diﬀerences, which consists of

Brownian particles moving in a sawtooth potential with an external load where the viscous medium

is alternately in contact with hot and cold heat reservoir along space coordinate. The motor can

work as a heat engine or a refrigerator under diﬀerent conditions. The heat ﬂow via both potential

and kinetic energy are considered. The former is reversible when the engine works quasistatically

and the latter is always irreversible. The eﬃciency of the heat engine (Coeﬃcient Of Performance

(COP) of a refrigerator) can never approach Carnot eﬃciency (COP).

INTRODUCTION

Recently, Brownian ratchets (motors) have attracted considered attention simulated by

research on molecular motors [1, 2]. A Brownian ratchet , which appeared in Feynman’s

famous textbook for the ﬁrst time as a thermal ratchet [3], is a machine which can rectify

thermal ﬂuctuation and produce a directed current. These subjects are motivated by the

challenge to understand molecular motors[4], nanoscale friction[5], surface smoothening [6],

coupled Josephson junctions [7], optical ratchets and directed motion of laser cooled atoms

[8], and mass separation and trapping schemes at the microscale[9].

The Brownian ratchet are spatially asymmetric but periodic structure in which transport

of Brownian particles is induced by some nonequilibrium processes [10, 11, 12, 13], such

as external modulation of the underling potential or a nonequilibrium chemical reaction

coupled to a change of the potential, or contact with reservoirs at diﬀerent temperatures.

The most intensively studied quantity has been on the velocity of the transport particle.

However, another important quantity is eﬃciency of energy conversion characteristic the

operation of the system when the transported particle does work.

How eﬃciency can Brownian ratchets work ? This question is important not only for the

construction of theory of molecular motors [14] but also for foundation of non-equilibrium

statistical physics. Like Carnot cycle, Brownian heat engine can extract work from the

temperature diﬀerence of the heat baths, where Brownian working material operates as a

transducer of thermal energy into work. The study of the energetics of Brownian ratchets

is relevant for several reasons [15]. Firstly, highly eﬃcient motors are desirable in order to

decrease the energy consumption or to decrease the heat dissipation. Secondly, Brownian

motors are related to fundamental problems of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics,

such as the Maxwell demon and the trade-oﬀ between entropy and information. Thirdly,

many models proposed in the literature are based on nonequilibrium ﬂuctuations without

specifying their source. On the other hand, the study of the energetics of such models re-

quired a more precise formulation, since one has to determine the physical nature of the

external agent and verify that the motor is consistent with the second law of thermodynam-

ics.

Recently, Sekimoto has been unambiguously deﬁned the concept of the heat at mesoscopic

scales in terms of Langevin equation [16]. He refers to the formalism providing this deﬁnition

2

as stochastic energetics. The essential point of this formalism is that the heat transferred

to the system is nothing but the microscopic work done by both friction force and the

random force in the Langevin equation. Stochastic energetics has been applied to the study

of thermodynamic processes. Derenyi and Astumian [17] have studied the eﬃciency of one-

dimensional thermally driven Brownian engines. They identify and compare the three basic

setups characterized by the type of the connection between the Brownian particle and the

two reservoirs: (1) simultaneous [3], (2) alternating in time [18], and (3)position dependent

[19]. Parrondo and Cisneros [15] has reviewed the literature the energetics of Brownian

motors, distinguishing between forced ratchet, chemical motors-driven out of equilibrium by

diﬀerence of chemical potential, and thermal motors-driven by temperature diﬀerences. In

this paper we give a detailed study of the last motors-thermal motors.

Energetics of the thermal motors-driven by temperature diﬀerences are investigated by

some previous works [20, 21]. Asfaw [20]et al. have explored the performance of the mo-

tors under various conditions of practical interest such as maximum power and optimized

eﬃciency. They found that the eﬃciency can approach the Carnot eﬃciency under the

quasistatic limit. The same results are also obtained in Matsuo and Sasa’s work [21] by

stochastic energetics theory. The previous works are limited to case of heat ﬂow via poten-

tial. The present work extends the study to case of heat ﬂow via both potential and kinetics

energy. The motor can work as a heat engine or a refrigerator under various conditions.

The eﬃciency of heat engine (COP of refrigerator) is diﬀerent from the results of previous

works and can never approach the Carnot eﬃciency (COP). The heat ﬂow via potential is

reversible when the engine works at quasistatic limit. The heat ﬂow via the kinetic is always

irreversible in nature.

THERMAL MOTOR WORKS AS A HEAT ENGINE

The model (shown in Fig. 1) consists of Brownian particles moving in a sawtooth potential

with an external load where the medium is alternately in contact with hot and cold heat

reservoirs along the space coordinate. Let E be the barrier height of the potential. L1, L2

are the length of the left part and the right part of the ratchet, respectively. E + F L1 is
the energy needed for a forward jump, while E − F L2 is the energy required for a backward

jump. The left part of a period ratchet is at temperature TH (hot reservoir)and the right

3

one is at temperature TC (cold reservoir). We can assumes that the rates of both forward

and backward jumps are proportional to the corresponding Arrhenius’ factor [22], such that

If

˙N+ > ˙N−, the ratchet works as a two-reservoir heat engine shown in Fig. 2. The rate

of heat ﬂow from hot reservoir to the heat engine via potential is given by

The rate of heat ﬂow from the engine to the cold reservoir via potential is

The heat ﬂow via the kinetic energy of the particle is much more complicated to deter-

mined [15]. Whenever a particle stay at a hot segment (temperature TH) it absorbs 1

reservoir will lost 1

leaves from a hot segment to a cold segment and then returns to the hot segment, the hot
2(kBTH −kBTC) energy on average, the lost energy is released to the colder
reservoir and never to the hot reservoir or to the particle’s potential energy, which indicates

the inherently irreversible nature of this heat ﬂow. On the other hand, if a particle goes

out from a hot segment to a cold segment and never returns to the hot segment, the hot

reservoir will lost 1

2kBTH energy on average. Therefore the rate of net heat ﬂow via kinetic

energy from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir is given by

η is always less than ηpot. The results are given by Fig. 3-10.

Figure 3 shows that the heat ﬂow qH , qC and power output w as a function of the load

f . When f = 0, namely, the engine runs without a load, qH is equal to qC, which indicates

that the heat that absorbs from the hot reservoir releases to the cold reservoir entirely and

no power output is obtained. When f increases, qH and qC decreases. when f → 0, no
power output is obtained (w=0). When f → fm, no currents occur, the ratchet can’t give

any power output. So the power output w has a maximum value at certain value of f which

depends on τ , ǫ and µ.

Figure 4 shows the variation of the eﬃciency ηC, ηpot, η with the load f . If the heat ﬂow

via kinetic energy is ignored, the eﬃciency ηpot increases with the load f , it approaches the

Carnot eﬃciency ηC at quasistatic condition (f =fm). The result is also presented in Asfaw’s

7

work [20]. When the heat ﬂow via kinetic energy are considered, the curve of the eﬃciency

η is observed to be bell-shaped, a feature of resonance. The eﬃciency η is always less than

ηpot and never approaches Carnot eﬃciency ηC. It is obvious that the heat ﬂow via kinetic

energy is always irreversible and energy leakage is inevitable, so the eﬃciency is less than

ηpot and can’t approach Carnot eﬃciency.

heat ﬂow qkin vs barrier height ǫ for diﬀerent values of f = 0.4, 1.0 at τ = 0.5, µ = 0.5.

Figure 5a shows the heat ﬂow qkin out of hot reservoir via kinetic energy as a function

of the load f . When f < fm, qkin is positive. When f > fm, qkin is negative. No heat ﬂow

occurs at f =fm. It is found that the heat ﬂow via kinetic is dependant on the current of

the ratchet. Figure 5b shows the heat ﬂow out of the hot reservoir via kinetic energy as a

function of barrier height ǫ. The curve is bell-shaped. Therefore, there is an optimized value

of ǫ at which qkin takes its maximum value.

Figure 6 shows the power output w as a function of the load f for diﬀerent values of

µ = 0.1, 0.5, 0.8. From the ﬁgure, we can see that the power output has a maximum value

at certain value of f . The maximum load fm of the engine changes with the parameter

µ of asymmetry in potential. In other word, the structure of the potential determines the

maximum load capability of the engine.

Figure 7 shows the variation of the eﬃciency η with the load f for diﬀerent values of

µ = 0.0, 0.5, 0.8. The maximum value of η increases with µ. However, the maximum value

of η can’t approach the Carnot eﬃciency.

values of the load f = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5. When ǫ → 0, the eﬀect of ratchet disappears, the power

output tends to zero. When ǫ → +∞ so that the particle can’t pass the barrier, the power

output w goes to zero, too. The power output w has a maximum value at certain value of

ǫ which is dependant on τ , µ and f . On the other hand, the minimum height of the barrier

for working as a heat engine increases with the load f .

Figure 9 shows the eﬃciency ηC, ηpot and η as a function of the barrier height. The

eﬃciency ηpot without the heat ﬂow via kinetic energy approaches the Carnot eﬃciency at

ǫ=ǫm, at which no power output occurs. The eﬃciency η is a peaked function of the barrier

height ǫ which is dependant on values of τ , f and µ.

and η change very slowly at small τ and they decreases drastically near τ = τm.

When the load f is less than the maximum load fm, the motor works as a heat engine.

The power output is a peaked function of the load f and the barrier height ǫ. The eﬃciency

η is less than the eﬃciency ηpot and can never approach the Carnot eﬃciency ηC. The heat

ﬂow via kinetic energy causes the energy leakage unavoidably and reduces the eﬃciency of

the heat engine.

THERMAL MOTOR WORKS AS A REFRIGERATOR

If the load is large enough along with appropriately chosen other quantities, the motor
will run in the reverse direction ˙N+ ≤ ˙N−. The motor will absorb the heat from the cold

reservoir and release it to the hot reservoir. Under this condition, the thermal motor acts

as a refrigerator shown in Fig. 11.

Figure 13 gives the plot of COP PC, Ppot and P versus the input force f . When the heat

of f and it approaches the Carnot COP at f = fm. When the heat ﬂow via kinetic energy is

considered, the curve of COP P is bell-shaped and it can never approach the Carnot COP

PC. The COP P without the heat ﬂow via kinetic energy is less than Ppot when fm < f < fC,

larger than Ppot when f > fC and equal to Ppot at f = fC. However, P can never approach

the Carnot COP PC.

µ = 0.5.

Figure 14 shows the variation of the COP P with the input force f for diﬀerent values

of the τ = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9. From the ﬁgure, it is easy to see that the COP P increases with

the value of τ and the minimum input force fm increases with the decreasing of the value

of τ . In an other word, when temperature diﬀerence is small, for example, τ = 0.9, the heat

leakage is small, so the COP P is large. On the contrary, when the minimum input force is

large, the temperature diﬀerence is large, for example, τ = 0.4.

When f is so large that the motor runs reversibly, f becomes the input force, so the

motor works as a refrigerator. The COP P is a peaked function of input force f which

indicates the the COP can not obtain a maximum value at quasi-static limit. The COP of

refrigerator can never approach the Carnot COP PC because of the heat ﬂow via kinetic

energy.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In present work, we study the energestic of a thermal motor which consists of Brownian

particles moving a sawtooth potential with an external load where the viscous medium is

alternately in contact with hot and cold reservoirs along the space coordinate. The thermal

motor can works as both a heat engine and a refrigerator. We make a clear distinction

between the heat ﬂow via the kinetic and the potential energy of the particle, and show that

the former is always irreversible and the latter may be reversible when the engine works

quasistatically.

When the external load is not enough, the thermal motor can work as a heat engine.

The power output has a maximum value at certain value of the load f which dependant

on the others parameters. If only the heat ﬂow via potential is considered, the eﬃciency

ηpot increases with the load f and approaches the Carnot eﬃciency ηC under quasistatic

condition, which agrees with the previous work. When the heat ﬂow via kinetic energy is

also considered, the eﬃciency η is less than ηpot and can never approach the Carnot eﬃciency

ηC. It is also found that the structure of the potential decides the maximum load capability

of the heat engine. The heat ﬂow via potential is reversible, while the heat ﬂow via kinetic

energy is irreversible. The heat ﬂow via kinetic energy reduces the heat engine eﬃciency.

When the external load is so large that the motor moves reversely, the thermal motor

can work as a refrigerator. When the heat ﬂow via kinetic energy is ignored, the COP Ppot

decreases with increasing of the input force f and can approach the Carnot COP PC. When

the heat ﬂow via both potential and kinetic energy are considered, the COP P is less than

Ppot when fm < f < fC, larger than Ppot when f > fC and equal to Ppot at f = fC. However,

P can never approach the Carnot COP PC.

The thermal motor was initially proposed in an attempt of describing molecular motors in

biological systems. The heat ﬂow via energy is irreversible, so the eﬃciency (COP) can not

approach the the Carnot eﬃciency (COP) at a quasistatic condition. However, Molecular

motors are known to operator eﬃciency [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. They can convert molecular

scale chemical energy into macroscopic mechanical work with high eﬃciency in water at

room temperatures, where the eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuation is unavoidable. Thus, the next

challenging question would be ” How to reduce the heat ﬂow via kinetic energy ? ”

Abstract

We describe a simple coarse-grained model which is suited to study lipid layers and their phase transitions. Lipids
are modeled by short semiﬂexible chains of beads with a solvophilic head and a solvophobic tail component. They are
forced to self-assemble into bilayers by a computationally cheap ‘phantom solvent’ environment. The model reproduces
the most important phases and phase transitions of monolayers and bilayers. Technical issues such as Monte Carlo
parallelization schemes are brieﬂy discussed.

Key words: membranes; coarse-grained simulations; phase transitions

1. Introduction

Lipid bilayers are the main components of biolog-
ical membranes and omnipresent in all living mat-
ter (1). At high temperatures bilayers assume the
so-called ‘liquid’ state (Lα), where lipids are highly
mobile and have many chain defects. In nature, this
state is the most frequent. If one decreases the tem-
perature, pure one-component lipid bilayers undergo
a prominent phase transition, the ‘main’ transition,
which is characterized by dropping lipid mobility,
dropping number of chain defects, and dropping area
per lipid. The structure of the low temperature ‘gel’
phase depends on the bulkiness and interactions of
the head groups. For small head groups, the chains
are oriented normal to the bilayer (Lβ phase), for
larger head groups, they are tilted (Lβ′). In the latter
case, the main transition occurs in two steps, and an
undulated intermediate phase emerges, the ‘ripple’
phase Pβ′. If head groups are large and weakly inter-
acting, such as ether-linked phosphatidylcholines,
the system assumes a phase Lint
β where both oppos-
ing lipid layers are fully interdigitated (2).

In this paper, we present a lipid model which is
suited for studying lipid bilayers. We will ﬁrst apply
it to lipid monolayers (Sec. 2) and show that it re-
produces the generic features of fatty acid monolay-
ers. Then we introduce an environment model which
forces the model lipids to self-assemble into bilay-
ers, and discuss the resulting bilayer phases (Sec. 3).
Selected technical issues regarding the Monte Carlo
implementation are discussed in the Appendix.

2. Lipids and Monolayers

The lipids are represented by chains of n − 1 ‘tail’
beads with diameter σt, attached to one ‘head’ bead
with diameter σh. Beads that are not direct neigh-
bors along their chain interact with a truncated and
shifted Lennard-Jones potential,

VLJ (r) = 0 otherwise, with vc chosen such that

teracting beads. Head-head interactions and head-
tail interactions are purely repulsive, which is en-

an attractive part, R0 = 2σ.

Within a chain, beads are connected by bonds
of length d subject to the weakly nonlinear spring

and Vs(d) = ∞ otherwise, where d0 is the equi-
librium spring length, ks the spring constant, and
the logarithmic cutoﬀ ensures that the spring length
never exceeds d0 + ds.

In addition, a bending potential

Va = ka(1 − cos θ)

(3)

is imposed, which acts on the angle θ between sub-
sequent bonds.

The parameters σt and ǫ provide ‘natural’ length
and energy units of the system. In these units, we
use ks = 100ǫ (very stiﬀ bonds), d0 = 0.7σt, ds =
0.2σt, ka = 4.7ǫ. The values are motivated by simple
considerations that map our chains on hydrocarbon
chains (4; 5); the ‘matching’ should not be taken too
literally, since the model is not designed to describe
experiments on a quantitative level. The size of the
head group, σh, and the chain length, n, are model

parameters that allow to study the inﬂuence of the
head group bulkiness and the chain length on the
phase behavior (5). Unless stated otherwise, they
are chosen σh = 1.1 and n = 7.

To evaluate the properties of the lipid model, we
ﬁrst consider monolayers of lipid at an air-water in-
terface. Such monolayers have been studied for a
long time as experimentally accessible model sys-
tems for lipid layers (1; 3). The monolayer equiva-
lent of the main transition is a transition encoun-
tered upon compression of the monolayer from a ‘liq-
uid expanded’ (LE) phase to a ‘liquid condensed’
phase. As in bilayers, the ordered ‘liquid condensed’
phase exists in several modiﬁcations, which diﬀer,
among other things, in the tilt order of the chains
(L2, LS, or Ov phase, see Fig. 1a). In the simulations,
the water surface can be replaced by suitable exter-
nal potentials. With smooth harmonic potentials of
width ∼ σ, we obtain the phase diagram shown in
Fig. 1b) (4). It is in good qualitative agreement with
the experimental phase diagram, Fig. 1a).

3. Phantom solvent and self-assembly

Having formulated a reasonable lipid model, we
must now force the ‘lipids’ to self-assemble into bi-
layers. In nature, self-assembly is caused by the in-
teraction with the surrounding water, hence we must
add an appropriate representation for the environ-
ment. This is done by introducing a recently pro-
posed, simple and very eﬃcient environment model:
The ‘phantom solvent’ model (6). Explicit ‘solvent’
particles are added to the system, which however do
not interact with each other, only with lipid beads
(by means of repulsive interactions, Eq. (1)). Phys-
ically, the solvent probes the accessible free volume
in the presence of lipids on the length scale of the
solvent diameter σs. Therefore, it promotes lipid ag-
gregation, and the lipids self-assemble to bilayers
(see Fig. 2). Compared to other explicit solvent mod-
els (7), the phantom solvent environment has the
advantage of having no internal structure, it thus
transmits no indirect interactions between diﬀerent
bilayer regions and/or periodic images of bilayers.
Furthermore, it is cheap – in Monte Carlo simula-
tions, less than 10 % of the computing time is spent
on the solvent. Compared to implicit solvent mod-
els (8), where the solvent is replaced by eﬀective
lipid interactions, it has the advantage that no tun-
ing of potentials is required, and it can also be used
to study solvent dynamics. For example, with DPD

4. Conclusions and Outlook

To conclude, we have presented a versatile coarse-
grained model that allows to study lipid monolayers
and self-assembled bilayers and reproduces their
most important internal phase transitions. It can
be used to study a variety of questions related to
membrane biophysics where atomic details do not
matter, but the characteristic molecular features
of lipids are still important. For example, we are
currently applying it to study lipid-mediated inter-
action mechanisms between proteins An example
snapshot is shown in Fig. 3.

Appendix: Technical Remarks

The Monte Carlo simulations described above
were carried out at constant pressure P with pe-
riodic boundary conditions in a simulation box of
variable size and shape: The simulation box is a
parallelepiped spanned by the vectors (Lx, 0, 0),
(s1Lx, Ly, 0), and (s2Lx, s3Ly, Lz). All Lα and si
are allowed to ﬂuctuate. In addition, it is sometimes
convenient to work in a semi-grand canonical en-
semble with ﬂuctuating number Ns of solvent beads
and given solvent chemical potential µs. Hence
we have three types of possible trial Monte Carlo
moves:
– Moves that change the positions of beads.
– Moves that changes the volume and/or shape of
the box: Random increments drawn randomly
from a symmetric distribution with mean zero
are added to Lα or si. All bead coordinates are
rescaled accordingly.

dynamics, one can study the eﬀect of hydrodynamic
coupling between membranes and the surrounding
ﬂuid.

In our work, the solvent diameter was chosen σs =
σh. Single head beads are soluble, (i.e., they do not
demix with solvent) if the free solvent density is
less than ρfree ∼ 2.6/σ3. At suﬃciently low tem-
peratures, the lipids self-assemble into bilayers (see
Fig. 2). The properties of these bilayers will be dis-
cussed in detail elsewhere (9; 10). Here we just cite
some of the main results. Like the monolayers, the
bilayers exhibit a main transition. For small heads
(σh = 0.9σ), the gel phase is untilted, i.e., we ob-
tain an Lα phase. For larger heads (σh = 1.1σ), the
structure of the gel phase depends on the free sol-
vent density ρfree. We note that the solvent entrop-
ically penalizes lipid/solvent interfaces and thus ef-
fectively creates an attractive depletion interaction
between the beads next to these interface, i.e., the
head beads. The strength of this interaction is pro-
portional to ρfree. At low ρfree, the gel phase is in-
β ), at moderate ρfree > 1.2/σ3, it is
terdigitated (Lint
tilted (Lβ′). Hence weak head attraction leads to the
formation of the interdigitated phase, and moderate
head attraction to the tilted gel phase, in agreement
with experiments.

Most rewardingly, we also recover the ripple
phase Pβ′ which intrudes between the tilted gel
phase and the ﬂuid phase. A snapshot is shown in
Fig. 2 c). The two main experimental rippled states,
the ‘asymmetric’ and the ‘symmetric’ rippled state,
are recovered in simulations, with properties that
are very similar to experimental properties (9). A
similar structure than that of our asymmetric ripple
has been found recently in a (much more involved)
atomistic simulation of a Lecithine bilayer (11). Our
simulations show that this structure is generic, in
the sense that it can be reproduced with a coarse-
grained model, and that it is closely related to the
structure of the corresponding symmetric rippled

– Moves that changes the number Ns of solvent
particles: We ﬁrst decide with probability 1/2
whether to attempt a solvent removal or a solvent
addition. Then, we choose randomly the particle
to be removed, or the position of the particle to
be added.

The moves are accepted or rejected according to
one of the standard Monte Carlo schemes (e.g.,
Metropolis), with the eﬀective Hamiltonian (12)

Heﬀ = H +P V −µsNs −kBT ln

(V /V0)N /Ns!
, (4)
(cid:3)
(cid:2)

where H is the interaction energy, V = LxLyLz
the volume of the simulation box, V0 an arbitrary
reference volume (e.g., V0 = σ3
t ), and N the total
number of beads (solvent and lipids). The Lα are not
allowed to fall below a given threshold, otherwise
the move is rejected.

We close with a remark on parallelization. For
large scale applications, our Monte Carlo code has
been parallelized geometrically. One commonly used
spatial decomposition scheme for systems with short
range interactions (see, e.g., the review (13)) pro-
ceeds as follows: The simulation box is divided into
domains which are distributed on the processors.
These are further subdivided into labelled subdo-
mains such that subdomains with the same label are
separated by a distance larger than the maximum
interaction range. Subdomains with the same label
are then processed in parallel. This algorithm is rel-
atively straightforward, yet it has the drawback that
it does not strictly fulﬁll detailed balance: Within
a move for given subdomain label α, particles can
cross a subdomain boundary only in one direction
(i.e., leaving the set of subdomains α). If the diﬀer-
ent sets α are processed equally often, the ﬁnal dis-
tribution is presumably not aﬀected. Nevertheless,
we feel uncomfortable with this method and favor
a variant of a parallelization scheme recently pro-
posed by Uhlherr et al. (14). The idea is to deﬁne
‘active regions’ and assign them to diﬀerent proces-
sors. A possible decomposition scheme is shown in
Fig. 4. Only particles with centers in the active re-
gions are moved, and moves that take a particle out-
side of its active region are rejected. To ensure that
the algorithm remains ergodic, the active regions are
periodically redeﬁned. One easily checks that indi-
vidual bead moves fulﬁll detailed balance. We note
that the active regions must not necessarily have the
same size, and furthermore moves in interesting re-
gions can be more frequent. This feature makes the
concept of ‘active regions’ interesting even for appli-
cations on scalar computers.

the parallelization of the Monte Carlo algorithm (a variant
of Uhlherr et al. (14)). The system is covered with a grid
of active regions (shaded rectangles, ﬁlled particles). The
distance between active regions must exceed the interaction
range between beads. The oﬀset of the active grid (arrow)
changes periodically and is chosen randomly.

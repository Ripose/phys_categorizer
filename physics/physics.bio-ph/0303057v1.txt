Abstract

Extracellular local ﬁeld potentials (LFP) are usually modeled as arising from a set of current sources

embedded in a homogeneous extracellular medium. Although this formalism can successfully model

several properties of LFPs, it does not account for their frequency-dependent attenuation with dis-

tance, a property essential to correctly model extracellular spikes. Here we derive expressions for

the extracellular potential that include this frequency-dependent attenuation. We ﬁrst show that, if

the extracellular conductivity is non-homogeneous, there is induction of non-homogeneous charge

densities which may result in a low-pass ﬁlter. We next derive a simpliﬁed model consisting of a

punctual (or spherical) current source with spherically-symmetric conductivity/permittivity gradients

around the source. We analyze the effect of different radial proﬁles of conductivity and permittivity

on the frequency-ﬁltering behavior of this model. We show that this simple model generally displays

low-pass ﬁltering behavior, in which fast electrical events (such as Na+-mediated action potentials)

attenuate very steeply with distance, while slower (K+-mediated) events propagate over larger dis-

tances in extracellular space, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. This simple

model can be used to obtain frequency-dependent extracellular ﬁeld potentials without taking into

account explicitly the complex folding of extracellular space.

INTRODUCTION

Extracellular potentials, such as local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs) or the electroencephalogram (EEG), are

routinely measured in electrophysiological experiments. The fact that action potentials have a limited

participation to the genesis of the EEG or LFPs was noted from early studies. Bremer (1938, 1949)

proposed that the EEG is generated by non-propagating potentials, based on the mismatch of time

course between EEG waves and action potentials. Eccles (1951) proposed that LFP and EEG activities

are generated by summated postsynaptic potentials arising from the synchronized excitation of cortical

neurons. Intracellular recordings from cortical neurons later demonstrated a close correspondence

between EEG/LFP activity and synaptic potentials (Klee et al., 1965; Creutzfeldt et al., 1996a, 1996b).

The current view is that EEG and LFPs are generated by synchronized synaptic currents arising on

cortical neurons, possibly through the formation of dipoles (Nunez, 1981; Niedermeyer and Lopes da

Silva, 1998).

The fact that action potentials do not participate to EEG-related activities indicate strong frequency-

ﬁltering properties of cortical tissue. High frequencies (greater than ≈ 100 Hz), such as that produced

by action potentials, are subject to a severe attenuation, and therefore are visible only for electrodes

immediately adjacent to the recorded cell. On the other hand, low-frequency events, such as synaptic

potentials, attenuate less with distance. These events can therefore propagate over large distances in

extracellular space and be recordable as far as on the surface of the scalp, where they can participate

in the genesis of the EEG. This frequency-dependent behavior is also seen routinely in extracellular

unit recordings: the amplitude of extracellularly-recorded spikes is very sensitive to the position of

the electrode, but slow events show much less sensitivity to the position. In other words, an extracel-

lular electrode records slow events that originate from a large number of neighboring neurons, while

the action potentials are recorded only for the cell(s) immediately adjacent to the electrode. This

fundamental property allows to resolve single units from extracellular recordings.

However, little is known about the physical basis of the frequency-dependent attenuation of extra-

cellular potentials in cortex. By contrast to intracellular events, which biophysical mechanisms have

been remarkably well characterized during the last 50 years (reviewed in Koch, 1999), comparatively

little has been done to investigate the biophysical mechanisms underlying the genesis of extracellular

ﬁeld potentials (see review by Nunez, 1981). The reason is that LFPs result from complex interac-

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

tions involving many factors, such as the spatial distribution of current sources, the spatial distribution

of positive and negative electric charges (forming dipoles), their time evolution (dynamics), as well

as the conductive and permittivity properties of the extracellular medium. One of the simplest and

widely used model of LFP activity considers current sources embedded in a homogeneous extracel-

lular medium (Nunez, 1981; Koch and Segev, 1998). Although this formalism has been successful in

many instances (Rall and Shepherd, 1968; Klee and Rall, 1977; Protopapas et al., 1998; Destexhe,

1998), it does not account for the frequency-dependent attenuation and therefore is inadequate for

modeling extracellular ﬁeld potentials including spike activity.

In this paper, we would like to investigate possible physical grounds for the frequency-ﬁltering

properties of LFPs. We start from ﬁrst principles (Maxwell equations) and consider different condi-

tions of current sources and extracellular media. We delineate the cases leading to frequency-ﬁltering

properties consistent with physiological data. We show that the assumption of a resistive homoge-

neous extracellular medium cannot account for the frequency-dependent attenuation. It is necessary

to take into account the inhomogeneous structure of the extracellular medium (in both permittivity and

conductivity) in order to account for frequency-dependent attenuation. We next analyze a simpliﬁed

representation of current sources in non-homogeneous media, and provide a simpliﬁed model which

could be applied to simulate extracellular ﬁeld potentials without using complex representations of

extracellular space. We terminate by showing a concrete example of the genesis of extracellular LFPs

from a conductance-based spiking neuron model.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

We will ﬁrst develop a general formalism to express the temporal variations of extracellular potential,

as well as a simple model in which most of the calculations can be done analytically (see Section

General theory; see also Appendix 1 and 2 for details). We will next explore this simpliﬁed model

numerically to illustrate its frequency-ﬁltering behavior (Section Numerical simulations), in which

we have performed two computations: (i) Calculate the impedance: the impedance is given by an

integral, which was evaluated numerically by standard numerical integration routines. (ii) Convert

time-dependent functions into frequency-spectra. These conversions were done via Fourier transfor-

mation (as well as its reverse transformation), which were carried out in C using standard numerical

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

routines (Press et al., 1986).

To test this formalism, we also considered a simple biophysical model of a spiking neuron con-

taining voltage-dependent and synaptic conductances (last part of Section Numerical simulations).

A single-compartment neuron was constructed and included conductance-based models of voltage-

dependent conductances and synaptic conductances. This model was described by the following

membrane equation:

Cm

dV
dt

= −gL(V − EL) − gNa(V − ENa) − gKd(V − EK) − gM(V − EK) − ge(V − Ee) ,

(1)

where Cm = 1 µF/cm2 is the speciﬁc membrane capacitance, gL = 4.52 × 10−5 S/cm2 and EL = -
70 mV are the leak conductance and reversal potential. gNa = 0.05 S/cm2 and gKd = 0.01 S/cm2
are the voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ conductances responsible for action potentials and were de-

scribed by a modiﬁed version of the Hodgkin & Huxley (1952) model. gM = 5 × 10−4 S/cm2 is a
slow voltage-dependent K+ conductance responsible for spike-frequency adaptation. ge = 0.4 µS is

a fast glutamatergic (excitatory) synaptic conductance. The voltage-dependent conductances were

described by conventional Hodgkin-Huxley type models adapted for modeling neocortical neurons,

and the synaptic conductance was described by a ﬁrst-order kinetic model of neurotransmitter binding

to postsynaptic receptors. These models and their kinetic parameters were described in detail in a

previous publication (Destexhe and Par´e, 1999). All numerical simulations were performed using the

NEURON simulation environment (Hines and Carnevale, 1997).

GENERAL THEORY

In this section, we outline the main features of the model starting from ﬁrst principles (Maxwell

equations). We will consider a number of different special cases and derive a simpliﬁed model with

radial (spherical) symmetry. In Section Numerical simulations, we will investigate numerically the

behavior of this simpliﬁed model.

In Maxwell’s theory, the electric properties of a conductive medium are determined by two pa-
rameters, conductivity s and permittivity e . While conductivity quantiﬁes the local relation between

the electric ﬁeld and the current, permittivity characterizes the response of the system in terms of

separation of opposite charges (polarisation) in the presence of an electric ﬁeld. Maxwell’s theory of

· (e E) = r

¶ t

j = s E ,

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

electromagnetism allows one to compute electric and magnetic ﬁelds or potentials, for a given distri-

bution of charges and electric currents. Because charges move very slowly in biological media, the

effects of magnetic ﬁelds are very small compared to that of the electric ﬁeld and will be neglected

here.

One of Maxwell’s equations is Gauss’ law:

Here E denotes is the electric ﬁeld, D = e E is the called displacement and r

is the charge density of

the extracellular medium, also allowed to vary slowly in time.

The continuity equation relates the current density j to the charge density r :

which states a balance between the electric ﬂux into some volume and the change of the total charge

in this volume. In other words, no charge will get lost.

Finally, there is Ohm’s law:

which states that the relation between the local electric ﬁeld and the local current density can be
described by a single macroscopic parameter s

. Here, we assume that the electric ﬁeld and the current

are parallel locally (i.e., at any given point in the medium). The coefﬁcient relating E and j, the
conductivity s

, is a scalar, which is justiﬁed by macroscopic measurements (Ranck, 1963).

Combining Eqs. 3 and 4 yields

· (s E) +

= 0 .

¶ t

This equation describes charge conservation in differential form.

In the following, we assume that electric currents are distributed on the surface of the membrane

(ionic currents), and that these currents are allowed to vary in time. We introduce the the electric

potential V (also called extracellular potential) which obeys

E = −(cid:209) V .

Below, we successively consider different cases of increasing complexity, starting with a homoge-

neous extracellular medium, then going over to non-homogeneous media.

Homogeneous extracellular medium

Consider a membrane embedded in a homogeneous extracellular medium, with conductivity s
and
permittivity e being held constant in space and time. As shown in Appendix 3, using the assumption
s = s 0 = const., e = e 0 = const., we get for each spectral component

((cid:209) Vw ) · (

(cid:209) (s + iw

) + D Vw = D Vw = 0 .

Hence we ﬁnd

Using the inverse Fourier transform, this yields

D Vw = −

e = 0 .

D V (x,t) = −

e = 0 .

One observes that the charge density r vanishes at the exterior of the sources. The solution depends

on the geometry considered, its symmetries and boundary conditions. We consider different cases

below.

Spherical membranes

As a particular case, let us consider a spherical membrane obeying the conditions outlined above

(homogeneous medium of constant conductivity and permittivity), in which the potential is allowed

to vary as a function of time. There are two classic cases of boundary conditions, which yield unique

solutions of the Laplace equation: (i) Speciﬁcation of the potential on a surface (Dirichlet boundary

condition) and (ii) Speciﬁcation of the derivative of the potential normal to the surface (Neumann

boundary condition). The latter is equivalent to specifying the normal component of the electric ﬁeld.

Due to Ohm’s law this means to specify the current density on the surface. In neurons, we consider

the Neumann conditions in which current sources represent the ionic currents in the membrane. In

this case, we have the following boundary conditions:

j(r = R) = j0n = s E(r = R) ,

(10)

Here, we have assumed that the membrane is spherical of radius R (which is also equivalent to consider

a point current source). The current density on the surface of the sphere is is proportional to the unit

vector n normal to the surface of the sphere.

To analyze the behavior of the extracellular potential as a function of frequency, we perform a

Fourier transformation with respect to time of the potential,

Vw (x) =

dt V (x,t)eiw

t .

The potential V satisﬁes the Laplace equation (11). Because the Fourier transform is linear, each

Fourier component Vw also satisﬁes (10). The solution, satisfying boundary conditions (Eq. 10), is

4p
where Iw = jw 0/(4p R2) is the total current for each frequency component. This shows that the po-

r

tential is the same for all frequency components. Therefore, there is no frequency-dependence in this

case.

Thus, the general expression for ﬁeld potentials resulting from a set of N current sources {I j} of

spherical symmetry is:

where x is a point in extracellular space, x j is the location of the jth current source, and |x − x j| is

the distance between x and x j. This expression is widely used to model extracellular ﬁeld potentials

(Nunez, 1981; Koch and Segev, 1998).

Cylindric membranes

Because neuronal processes (dendrites, axons) are closer to cylinders, we considered cylindric mem-

branes as a second particular case. Here, the procedure is similar to the above, but the geometry and

symmetries are different. If we assume that the membrane potential respects cylindric symmetry (ie,

V does not depend on the rotation angle around the cylinder axis), and is uniform on the surface of the

membrane (isopotential compartment), then Eq. 9 can be solved for each component of the frequency

spectrum and has a unique solution:

Vw (r) = Vw (R) + jw (R)

ln (r/R) ,

(14)

where r is the distance perpendicular to the cylinder axis, while jw (R) and Vw (R) are the w

components of the current density and potential at the surface of the cylinder.

In this case again, the extracellular potential is independent of the frequency. The same conclusion

applies to membranes of arbitrary geometries taken in the same conditions because the w

-frequency

component of the current density and potential obey Laplace equation. There is therefore no frequency

dependence arising from single current sources in homogeneous media.

Non-homogeneous extracellular medium

We have shown above that, in a homogeneous medium with a current source of spherical or cylindric

symmetry, the extracellular electric potential is the same for all frequency components, and there-

fore cannot display frequency-dependent properties. We now turn to a possible source of frequency-

dependent attenuation, namely the presence of inhomogeneities in the conductivity of the extracellular

medium.

Stationary currents in spherically-symmetric non-homogeneous medium

Before investigating the general case, let us ﬁrst consider the case of a static spherical current source
embedded in a medium where the conductivity s conserves spherical symmetry, but varies as a func-
tion of distance r (as above we assume that s does not depend on time). We also continue to assume
that permittivity e

is homogeneous. If the total current ﬂowing through the sphere of radius R is

denoted by I, then the radial dependence of the current density is given by

In this case, the charge density r

is non-zero and is given by

Then Ohm’s law implies for the spherically symmetric electric ﬁeld

Details of the calculation can be found in Appendix 1.

This equation shows that the potential may decrease or even increase, depending on the spatial

variations of s

. An important consequence is that such net charge creates its own electric ﬁeld (so-

called secondary ﬁeld), which will be analyzed in more detail below. What is the physical origin of
this non-zero net charge? The current density behaves like J (cid:181) 1/r2, (Eq. 15), and the electric ﬁeld
like E (cid:181) 1/(s (r)r2), (Eq. 17). Consequently, there will be accumulations of charges in some regions

of lower conductivity, similar to trafﬁc jams. Consider a more realistic case in which the conductivity

of the extracellular space is constant on average, but displays spatial ﬂuctuations around this average.

This could correspond for example to different processes and obstacles in the extracellular medium.

In this case, the electric ﬁeld , going like 1/r2 on average, ﬂuctuates locally. This creates local areas

of positive and negative charge, i.e. electric dipoles. Those dipoles also create a secondary electric

ﬁeld. However, to account for frequency dependence, time-varying current sources must necessarily

be considered, in which case the situation is more complex, as analyzed in the next section.

Time-varying currents in non-homogeneous medium

Let us now consider the general case where both e and s are non-homogeneous in space, but constant

in time. We assume that the current source is allowed to vary in time. The continuity equation implies

that the charge density is also time-dependent. Ohm’s law implies that the electric ﬁeld has a time-
dependence as well, and so will also the extracellular potential. Due to the inhomogeneity of e , the

extracellular potential does no longer satisfy Poisson’s equation. To study the frequency-dependence

of the extracellular potential, we perform a Fourier transform of the electric ﬁeld, the potential and
likewise of the charge density r

This equation expresses the differential law of charge conservation for a given Fourier component.

Now we consider the Gauss’ law (Eq. 2), the law of charge conservation in differential form (Eq. 5),

and carry out the Fourier transform with respect to time. Taking into account Eq. 19 yields

D Vw = −

For details, see Appendix 2.

This equation is general and applies to any particular symmetries (under the assumption of scalar

conductivity). We consider below a series of special cases, as well as special symmetries.

Special cases

As a ﬁrst special case, consider Eq 20 when permittivity is constant. Then Ohm’s law (Eq. 4) implies

Constant permittivity also implies (cid:209) (s + iw

) = (cid:209) (s ). Hence Eq. 20 takes the form
(cid:209) Vw
· (cid:209)
s + iw

.

D Vw = −

We therefore observe the occurrence of a (complex) phase difference between the induced charge
density r /e and the current density j (recall: −(cid:209) Vw = Ew = jw /s ). This effect depends on the
frequency w of the Fourier component. Such phenomenon is well known from electric circuits of the

RC type, where in general a phase difference between potential and current is observed. In particular,

if the potential vanishes at some time t, the electric charge density will not immediately go to zero.

Eq. 22 shows that for high enough frequency the induced charge density goes to zero. On the other

hand, for low-frequency phenomena, the charge density will carry out large ﬂuctuations and will be

sensitive to spatial ﬂuctuations of conductivity. This has important consequences for interpreting LFP

activity (see Section Frequency-ﬁltering properties of non-homogeneous media).

As another special case, consider Eq. 20 when the conductivity is constant. The law of charge

conservation in differential form Eq. 5 then becomes

). Hence Eq. 20 takes the form

This means in the limit of low frequencies that there are no current sinks or sources.

A third noteworthy special case is when both permittivity and conductivity are non-homogeneous,

but have a ﬁxed ratio:

s = const.

All frequency-dependence cancels out, the potential becomes frequency independent.

Frequency-ﬁltering properties of non-homogeneous media

We now analyze the frequency-ﬁltering properties of Eq. 20. Consider this equation in two limit

cases: (i) w << s /e
independent of the permittivity e and is determined only by the conductivity s

These two cases will be considered in more detail below. The critical frequency around which this
transition will occur depends on the relative values of s and e , and one can deﬁne the following critical

frequency fcr

fcr = 2p

cr,

cr =

.

(27)

As an example, consider the value of average resistivity r res (inverse of conductivity s ) measured
in rabbit cerebral cortex (Ranck, 1963), giving r res = 3W m. Taking the permittivity of salt water
(e = 7 × 10−10F/m), gives a critical frequency of fcr of about 1010 Hz. Thus, this analysis shows that
the behavior will be similar for low and high frequency limits. However, if one evaluates 2p
for
a resting membrane (closed ion channels; r ≃ 109W m and e ≃ 10−10F/m), one ﬁnds for the critical

/e

frequency a value in the range between 0 and 100 Hz. The phenomenon of induced charges will be

likely to play a role in the frequency range of synaptic inputs in cerebral cortex (0 to 40 Hz). On the

other hand, higher frequencies (> 100 Hz) – such as action potentials – are likely to cause negligible

variations in charge density.

Further, we can compare Eq. 20 to cases where there is no frequency dependence (i.e., Laplace

Eq. 9). At the limit of high frequencies, the left term of Eq. 20 vanishes and this equation becomes

equivalent to Eq. 9, showing that for high frequencies, one recovers the same behavior as for a homo-

geneous medium. To have a low-pass ﬁlter, similar to what is observed from extracellular recordings,

one must have a situation in which the attenuation of the potential at low frequencies must be less than

for homogeneous media. Inspection of the left term of Eq. 20 shows that the attenuation can be either

less or more pronounced, resulting in low- or high-pass ﬁlters. The type of ﬁlter will depend on the

behavior of the gradients of conductivity and permittivity. This behavior will be analyzed numerically

in more detail later (see Section Numerical simulations).

Time-varying currents in spherically-symmetric non-homogeneous medium

In order to calculate the extracellular potential V generated by time-varying currents in non-homo-

geneous media, Eq. 20 must be integrated by incorporating details about the particular geometry

of current sources and extracellular properties. A general method for solving this problem is, e.g.,

ﬁnite-element analysis, which allows to explicitly incorporate the complex shape and composition

of extracellular space around neurons. However, this approach requires to integrate complex mor-

phological data and appropriate simulation tools. We defer this to a future study. In order to have a

model of LFPs applicable to standard neuron models, we follow here a simpler approach, based on

the following simpliﬁcation: we consider that the variations of conductivity and permittivity have a

radial symmetry in the vicinity of the current sources. This simpliﬁcation allows us to obtain sim-

pler expressions of the extracellular potential, still displaying frequency dependence, and apply this

formalism using standard simulation tools.

Consider Eq. 20 for the case of a spherically-symmetric system. Then the potential obeys

This can be veriﬁed by differentiating this equation with respect to r, which then yields Eq. 28. Inte-

media. In the numerical part (Section Numerical simulations), we will solve this equation for different
spatial proﬁles of s and e . To this end, it is useful to deﬁne the impedance:

The impedance is therefore the “ﬁlter” applied to the w

-frequency component of the current source,

to yield the corresponding frequency component of the extracellular potential. In the next section, we

will examine the frequency-ﬁltering properties of different extracellular media by calculating numer-

ically the impedance for different cases of spatial inhomogeneities of conductivity and permittivity.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In this section, we use the expressions of the extracellular potential obtained above. In particular

we analyze the behavior of the extracellular potential generated by a current source in a spherically-

symmetric non-homogeneous medium (Eq. 33), and its associated impedance (Eq. 34). We investi-

gated the frequency-ﬁltering properties obtained for different cases of increasing complexity of the
and e . The goal is to determine the conditions of spatial variations of conductiv-
radial proﬁle of s

ity and permittivity for which the frequency-ﬁltering properties are consistent with physiological data.

We terminate by an application of this model to calculating the LFP generated by a conductance-based

spiking neuron model.

Parameters

Precise experimental data on the variations of permittivity e and conductivity s

in the extracellular

medium have not been measured so far. However, averaged values of these parameters are available
, averaged over large extracellular distances, s av,
from macroscopic measurements. A value for s

was measured by Ranck (1963) and was between 0.28 S/m and 0.43 S/m, for 5 Hz and 5 kHz,

respectively. The macroscopic frequency dependence of conductivity seems therefore relatively weak.

However, the situation is different microscopically. As reviewed in Nunez (1981), the conductivity of

the CSF ﬂuid is 1.56 S/m while the typical conductivity of membranes is 3.5 × 10−9 S/m. This value

was obtained from the resting (leak) membrane conductance of cortical neurons, typically around

4.5 × 10−5 S/cm2, multiplied by the thickness of the membrane (7-8 nm; Peters et al., 1991). At

microscopic scales, there is therefore approximately 9 orders of magnitude variations of conductivity.

Permittivity variations are not so dramatic. Fluids have higher permittivity, for example it is

about 7 × 10−10 F/m for sea water. Membranes have a permittivity of about 7.5 × 10−11 F/m. The

latter value was derived from the speciﬁc capacitance of membranes, C = 1 µ F/cm2 (Johnston and

Wu, 1997), and assuming a membrane thickness of 7.5 nm (Peters et al., 1991). Because those

variations are small compared to the variations of conductivity, it is a good approximation to consider
the permittivity as a constant. In the following, we will use the reference value of e = 10−10 F/m.

In the following we will use normalized values for conductivity s (r)/s (R) and permittivity e (r)/s (R).

Because the membrane is always surrounded by extracellular ﬂuid, s (R) = 1.56 S/m and the normal-
ized conductivity s (r)/s (R) therefore varies between 1 and about 2 × 10−9. Similarly, the normalized
(constant) value of permittivity will be e (r)/s (R) = 6 × 10−11 s.

Frequency-ﬁltering properties of spherically-symmetric media

We calculated numerically the impedance (Eq. 34) for different cases of spatial variations of conduc-

tivity and permittivity. In all cases we assumed a current source with spherical geometry, characterized
by radius R, and that s and e vary according to a radial (spherical) symmetry around this current source

(see scheme in Fig. 1A). For each case, we represented the normalized impedance

˜Zw (r) = Zw (r)/Zw (R) ,

(36)

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

16

which allows better comparison between the different cases. Because the value of impedance does not
and e by a constant factor
depend on the absolute value of permittivity and conductivity (dividing s
does not change Zw (r) in Eq. 34), we used the normalized conductivity s (r)/s (R) and the normalized
permittivity e (r)/s (R) deﬁned above. It is also convenient to represent all distances in units of R,

although we also considered absolute values of distances (see below).

We ﬁrst investigated a simple case of smooth variations of those parameters, to illustrate the dif-

ferent types of frequency ﬁltering that can be obtained in this model. The proﬁles of conductivity

and permittivity are shown in Figs. 1B and C. These curves tend to the same asymptotic value for

large distances. The corresponding impedance is shown as a function of frequency f in Figs. 1D-F
(see Appendix 3 for details of the method). When the ratio s /e

is kept constant (Fig. 1D-F, dotted

line), there is no frequency dependence as analyzed above in Section Special cases. In the case of

a decreasing conductivity with distance combined with constant permittivity, one has a high-pass ﬁl-

ter (Fig. 1D-F, dashed line). By contrast, a low-pass ﬁlter is observed if an increasing conductivity

with distance is combined with a constant permittivity (Fig. 1D-F, solid line). Thus, there is a clear
frequency-dependent behavior when s

and/or e vary as function of distance r, if the ratio s /e

is not

constant. This also shows that low- and high-pass ﬁlters are both possible, depending on the exact
form of the function s (r) and e (r). The impedance can also have a non-zero imaginary part, which

means that beyond resistivity, the medium has is also capacitive properties. In this case, there will be

a phase difference between the potential and the current.

We next considered a case characterized by a localized drop of conductivity (Fig. 2A) while per-

mittivity was kept constant (Fig. 2B). The resulting impedance measured at different distances from

the source is shown in Fig. 2C-E as a function of frequency f . In this case, for distances around the

conductivity drop, there is a moderate frequency dependence with low-pass characteristics (Fig. 2C-

E, dotted and dashed lines). However, for larger distances, the imaginary part is zero and there is no

frequency dependence (Fig. 2C-E, solid lines). This is explained by the fact that for large distances
s (r) = s (R) and e (r) = e (R). This behavior can also be seen in the attenuation of the different fre-

quency components illustrated in Fig. 2F. There is a different attenuation only for distances around

the region where conductivity varies.

Because the extracellular space is composed of alternating ﬂuids and membranes (Peters et al.,

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

17

1991), which have high and low conductivity, respectively, we have next considered the situation

where conductivity ﬂuctuates periodically with distance (Fig. 3). Considering a cosine function

of conductivity (Fig. 3A) with constant permittivity (Fig. 3B) leads to a rather strong frequency-

dependent attenuation (Fig. 3C-E) with low-pass characteristics. There was a strong attenuation with

distance for all frequencies (Fig. 3F). Very similar results were obtained with other periodic functions

(for example by replacing cos by sin in the function used in Fig. 3A), different oscillation periods, or

even for damped oscillations of conductivity (not shown).

It could be argued that although ﬂuids and membranes alternate in extracellular space, there is an

efﬁcient diffusion of ions only in the extracellular ﬂuid around the membrane. For larger distances,

diffusion becomes increasingly difﬁcult because of the increased probability of meeting obstacles. In

this case, conductivity would be highest around the source and progressively decrease to an “average”

conductivity level for larger distances. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 4. We have considered that

the conductivity is highest at the source, then decreases exponentially with distance with a space con-
stant l

(Fig. 4A; note that in this case, real distances were used). Permittivity was constant (Fig. 4B).

The resulting impedance displayed pronounced frequency-ﬁltering properties with low-pass charac-

teristics (Fig. 4C-E). In particular, the attenuation with distance revealed strong differences between

low and high frequencies of the spectrum (Fig. 4F). Similar results can be obtained with other de-

creasing functions of connectivity (not shown).

The above examples show that there can be a strong frequency-ﬁltering behavior, with low-pass

characteristics as observed in experiments. However, although these examples show a more effective

ﬁltering for high frequencies, it still remains to be shown that the high frequencies attenuate more

steeply with distance compared to low frequencies. To this end, we deﬁne the quantity:

Q100 = Z100(r)/Z1(r) ,

(37)

where Z1 and Z100 are the impedances computed at 1 Hz and 100 Hz, respectively. This ratio quanti-

ﬁes the differential ﬁltering of fast and slow frequencies as a function of distance r. Fig. 5A displays

the Q100 values obtained for some of the examples considered above. In the case of a localized drop

of conductivity (Fig. 5A, Drop), there was an effect of distance for r < 16R, then the Q100 remained

equal to unity for further distances. This behavior is in agreement with the impedance shown in Fig. 2,

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

18

in which case there was no frequency ﬁltering for r > 16R. For oscillatory conductivities (Fig. 5A,

Osc), the Q100 was always < 1, consistent with the low-pass frequency-ﬁltering behavior observed in

Fig. 3. However, the Q100 oscillated around a value of 0.6 and did not further decrease with distance.

Thus, in this case, although there was a clear low-pass ﬁltering behavior, all frequencies still contribute

by the same relative amount to the extracellular potential, regardless of distance. On the other hand,

with exponential decay of conductivity, the Q100 monotonically decreased with distance (Fig. 5A,

Exp). Thus, this case shows both low-pass ﬁltering behavior (Fig. 4) and a stronger attenuation of

high frequencies compared to low frequencies (Fig. 5A, Exp), which is in qualitative agreement with

experiments. Analyzing exponentially-decaying conductivities of different space constants (Fig. 5B)

revealed that the various patterns of distance dependence approximately followed the pattern of con-

ductivity (Fig. 5C). This type of conductivity proﬁle is relatively simple and plausible, and will be the

one considered in the biophysical model investigated below.

Biophysical model of the frequency-ﬁltering properties of local ﬁeld potentials

We have applied the above formalism to model the frequency dependence of the extracellular ﬁeld

potentials stemming from a conductance-based spiking neuron model. The details about the model are

given in the Material and methods section, while the details of the calculation of the extracellular LFP

(general for any current source) is given in Appendix 3. The proﬁle of conductivity and permittivity

used is that of Fig. 4. We calculated the total membrane current generated by a single-compartment

model of an adapting cortical neuron, containing voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ conductances for

generating action potentials and a slow voltage-dependent K+ conductance responsible for spike-

frequency adaptation. The model also contained a fast glutamatergic excitatory synaptic conductance,

which was adjusted to evoke a post-synaptic potential just above threshold, in order to evoke a single

action potential (Fig. 6A). The total membrane current (Fig. 6B) was calculated and stored in order

to calculate its Fourier transform (power spectral density shown in Fig. 6C). The impedance of the

extracellular medium (Fig. 6D) was calculated using absolute values of the parameters (Eq. 34).

This model was used to calculate the ﬁeld potentials at different radial distances assuming the

neuron was a spherical source (radius of 105 µm). The extracellular potential is indicated for 5, 100,

500 and 1000 µm away from the source (see Fig. 6E) and strong frequency ﬁltering properties are

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

19

apparent: the fast negative deﬂection of extracellular voltage showed a steep attenuation and almost

disappeared at 1000 µm (although it had the highest amplitude at 5 µm). In contrast, the slow positive

deﬂection of the extracellular potential showed less attenuation with distance and became dominant

at large distances (500 and 1000 µm in the example of Fig. 6E).

Thus, this simple example illustrates that the approach provided here can lead to a relatively simple

model to calculate local ﬁeld potentials with frequency ﬁltering properties. The exact proﬁles of

ﬁltering and attenuation depend on the exact shape of the gradients of conductivity/permittivity as

well as on the spherical symmetry inherent to this model.

DISCUSSION

are provided.

In this paper, we have provided a model of extracellular ﬁeld potentials in non-homogeneous media.

We discuss here the validity of this model, how it relates to previous studies, and what perspectives

The theoretical analysis outlined in Section General theory shows that inhomogeneities of ex-

tracellular space (with respect to conductivity and/or permittivity) is a possible cause for frequency

ﬁltering. In general, non-homogeneous extracellular media will differently affect the attenuation of

the various frequency components of the current sources, and can lead to high-pass or low-pass ﬁlters

depending on the gradients of conductivity and permittivity. The composition of extracellular space

is made from the alternance of ﬂuids and membranes (Peters et al., 1991). Because these media have

very different conductivity and permittivity, one may expect that the extracellular space is necessarily

highly non-homogeneous. Therefore, the structural composition of extracellular space is very likely

to be a main determinant of the frequency-ﬁltering properties of LFPs. In addition, the conductivity of

the extracellular ﬂuid directly beneath the membrane depends on the ionic concentrations present. It

turns out that the extracellular ionic concentrations may vary in time, in an activity-dependent manner

(reviewed in Amzica, 2002). Therefore, it is also likely that there is an activity dependent contribution

to the ﬁltering properties of the extracellular medium. Here, we did not consider such time-dependent

variations of conductivity, but this type of contribution is certainly worth to be considered by future

theoretical work.

To correctly simulate the frequency-ﬁltering behavior due to extracellular inhomogeneity, the ex-

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

20

tracellular potential should be calculated by a model incorporating details about the three-dimensional

composition of the extracellular medium. Such type of simulations should use methods such as ﬁnite-

element analysis. However, the complexity of this type of analysis, and of the data it requires, makes

such simulations inaccessible to standard models. In addition, this requires orders of magnitude differ-

ences in computational power needs. For these reasons, we have considered the option of generating

a simpliﬁed model under some approximation. We assumed that the geometry of extracellular inho-

mogeneities is spheric around the current source. In this condition, one can obtain relatively simple

expressions of the extracellular potential such as Eq. 33. Not only this expression is amenable to

theoretical analysis, but it is also sufﬁciently simple to be applied to current neuron models which do

not have an explicit representation of extracellular space.

The drawback of this method is that it considers an un-realistic (radial) distribution of inhomo-

geneities in extracellular space, which will necessarily affect the frequency-ﬁltering properties pro-

duced by the model. However, it should be possible to calculate the “average” radial variations of
conductivity and permittivity by averaging the proﬁles of s and e

in all directions emanating from neu-

ronal membranes using three-dimensional reconstructions of the neuropil. Another direction would
and e , but such data are not cur-
be to measure experimentally the proﬁles and distributions of s

rently available. Here, we have used “heuristic” proﬁles of conductivity and permittivity, which gives

frequency-ﬁltering properties in qualitative agreement with experiments. It should be easy to make
and e when there will be
this model more realistic by incorporating different radial functions of s

better constraints by measurements.

The present results lead to several interesting perspectives for future work or extensions. First, as

mentioned above, the simpliﬁed model could be enhanced by comparison with a more realistic model,

for example based on three-dimensional reconstructions of extracellular space. The simpliﬁed model

could be adjusted so that it ﬁts as closely as possible the behavior of the more realistic model, yielding

more optimal expressions of the radial proﬁles of conductivity and permittivity. A second possible

direction is the “reverse” problem of estimating neuronal activity based on LFP measurements. By

using data on the spatial and temporal variations of multisite LFPs and multi-unit activity, it should be

possible to estimate what are the respective contributions of the natural frequency-ﬁltering properties

of extracellular space and the spatial coherence of neuronal sources in the different frequency com-

Bedardetal.,manuscriptofJanuary17,2014

21

ponents. For example, it was shown that a consistent relation between LFP and cell ﬁring extends to

large cortical distances (>7 mm) for slow-waves but not for fast oscillations in the gamma (20-60 Hz)

frequency range (Destexhe et al., 1999). A model of LFP is needed to evaluate whether this effect

is really due to differences in the coherence of neuronal ﬁring (as the single-unit data indicates), or

if a large part could be explained by the low-pass ﬁltering properties of the extracellular medium. A

combination of experimental recordings and computational models will be needed to understand how

neuronal activity translates into extracellular ﬁeld potentials and vice-versa.

This quantity is computed for each frequency component w of the spectrum, and for each extra-

cellular distance r considered. It can be precalculated and stored in a matrix (Z[ f ][r]).

2. For each current source, compute the (complex) Fourier transform of the total membrane cur-

rent, which we call here Iw

3. For each current source, compute the Fourier component w of the extracellular potential:

Vw (r) = Zw (r) Iw

4. For each current source, compute the extracellular potential by applying the (complex) inverse

Fourier transform to Eq. 65.

5. Finally, combine the contributions from all current sources to yield the extracellular potential at

a given position x in the extracellular space.

Figure 1: Radial variations of conductivity and permittivity can induce frequency-ﬁltering properties.

A. Scheme of the current source in radial symmetry. The current source is assumed to be spherical

(continuous line; radius R). The conductivity and permittivity vary in radial symmetry according to
the distance r from the center of the source. B. Conductivity s vs. radial distance r. Two cases are
shown: (1) s (r)/s (R) = 1 +
r0/r, where r0 = 0.2025 R (R=1
here). C. Permittivity e vs. radial distance r. The two curves shown are: (3) e (r)/s (R) = 0.01 and (4)
e (r)/s (R) = 0.01 [1 −

such that s (r)/e (r) = const., in which case there is no frequency dependence (dotted line).

A. Proﬁle of conductivity vs. distance. The conductivity was described by s (r)/s (R) = 1 − 0.2 (r −
6R)/R for 6R < r < 11R, s (r)/s (R) = −1 + 0.2 (r − 6R)/R for 11R < r < 16R, and s (r)/s (R) = 1
otherwise. B. Proﬁle of permittivity. e (r)/s (R) was constant and equal to 0.01. C-E. Real part (C),

imaginary part (D) and norm (E) of the impedance as a function of frequency f . Zw (r) is shown

for different distances r away from the source. F. Attenuation of the impedance norm |Zw (r)| with

distance. The different curves correspond to three different frequencies.

A. Ratio of impedance at fast and slow frequencies (Q100) represented as a function of distance r

(units of R). The Q100 ratios are represented for different proﬁles of conductivity. Drop: localized

drop of conductivity (short dash; same parameters as in Fig. 2). Osc: oscillatory proﬁle of conductivity

(solid line; same parameters as in Fig. 3; the dotted line indicates a damped cosine oscillation). Exp:

Figure 6: Frequency-ﬁltered extracellular ﬁeld potentials in a conductance-based model.

A. Membrane potential of a single-compartment model containing voltage-dependent Na+ and K+

conductances and a glutamatergic synaptic conductance. The glutamatergic synapse was stimulated

at t = 5 ms (arrow) and evoked an action potential. B. Total membrane current generated by this

model. Negative currents correspond to Na+ and glutamatergic conductances (inward currents), while

positive currents correspond to K+ conductances (outward currents). C. Power spectrum of the total

current shown in B. D. Impedance at 500 µm from the current source assuming a radial proﬁle of con-

ductivity and permittivity (as in Fig. 4). E. Extracellular potential calculated at various distances from

the source (5, 100, 500 and 1000 µm). The frequency ﬁltering properties can be seen by comparing

the negative and positive deﬂections of the extracellular potential. The fast negative deﬂection almost

disappeared at 1000 µm whereas the slow positive deﬂection was still present.

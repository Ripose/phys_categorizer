autoregulation dynamics

(Dated: September 28, 2013)

We employ a synchronization method to investigate the relationship between the blood ﬂow veloc-
ities (BFV) in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) recorded
from a ﬁnger in healthy and post-stroke subjects during four diﬀerent physiologic conditions: supine,
head-up tilt, hyperventilation and CO2 rebreathing in upright position. To evaluate whether instan-
taneous BP changes are synchronized with changes in the BFV, we compare dynamical patterns in
the instantaneous phases of these signals, obtained from the Hilbert transform, as a function of time.
We ﬁnd that in post-stroke subjects the instantaneous phase increments of BP and BFV exhibit well
pronounced patterns that remain stable in time for all four physiologic conditions, while in healthy
subjects these patterns are diﬀerent, less pronounced and more variable. Further, we show that the
instantaneous phase increments of BP and BFV are cross-correlated even within a single heartbeat
cycle. The maximum correlation strength is diﬀerent between conditions and between the groups.
For healthy subjects the amplitude of the cross-correlation function is small and attenuates within
3-5 heartbeats. In contrast, for post-stroke subjects, this amplitude is signiﬁcantly larger and cross-
correlations persist up to 20 heartbeats. These ﬁndings provide new insight into the mechanism of
cerebral vascular control in healthy subjects, suggesting rapid adjustments (within a heartbeat) of
the cerebral BFV to changes in peripheral BP.

INTRODUCTION

Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is the ability of cerebral
blood vessels to maintain steady cerebral perfusion in re-
sponse to ﬂuctuations of systemic blood pressure (BP),
postural changes or metabolic demands. This regulatory
mechanism is known to operate over a range of blood
pressure values (e.g. 80 - 150 mm Hg) [1] and on time
scales above several heartbeats [2]. The longterm CA
compensates for chronic BP elevations and metabolic
demands [3]. Ischemic stroke is associated with an im-
pairment of autoregulation [4, 5], that may permanently
aﬀect cerebrovascular reactivity to chemical and blood
pressure stimuli [6, 7]. With impaired CA, the cerebral
blood ﬂow follows BP ﬂuctuations posing a risk of insuf-
ﬁcient blood supply to the brain during transient drops
in peripheral BP. Therefore, evaluating the eﬀectiveness
of CA is of great interest, given the clinical implications.
Traditional experimental methods to probe the mech-
anism of CA require time-consuming invasive proce-
dures [8, 9] and are focused on long term BP and BFV
characteristics such as the mean, lacking descriptors of
temporal BP-BFV relationship. To address this prob-
lem, an alternative ”dynamic” approach has been pro-

cal aspects. PChI proposed the analysis method, and guided the

posed [10] to quantify CA using transcranial Doppler ul-
trasound during the transient responses in cerebral blood
ﬂow velocity to the rapid BP changes, induced experi-
mentally by thigh cuﬀs inﬂation, Valsalva maneuver, tilt-
up or a change in posture [3, 11]. The indices from this
approach may be more sensitive to indicators of hypop-
erfusion after stroke [12].

The analytic methods valuating the dynamics of cere-
bral autoregulation are currently based on mathemati-
cal modeling and Fourier transform analysis [32]. The
Fourier transform based transfer function method has
been widely used [2]. This method calculates a rela-
tive cross-spectrum between BFV and BP signals in the
frequency domain. Dynamic indices of autoregulation,
based on Fourier transform methods presume (i) signal
stationarity (i.e., the mean and standard deviation of the
signal are invariant under a time shift) and (ii) a linear
BFV-BP relationship. However, physiologic signals are
often nonstationary reﬂecting transient changes in the
physiologic state [13]. The eﬀect of this nonstationarity
on the results obtained from the transfer function analy-
sis, has not been carefully assessed in previous studies.

Here we investigate the dynamics of BP-BFV relation-
ship during the quasi-steady state. While studies tradi-
tionally have focused on response in BFV to rapid tran-
sient changes in BP [3], we hypothesize that spontaneous
physiologic ﬂuctuations during a quasi-steady state may
also contain important information about the CA mech-
anism. To test this hypothesis, we have measured BP
and BFV signals from healthy and post-stroke subjects

during four physiologic conditions: supine and tilt, hy-
perventilation, CO2 rebreathing in upright position. We
have applied a novel phase synchronization method to
quantify the dynamical BP-BFV relationship in these
quasi-steady conditions.
Interactions between periph-
eral circulation (beat-to-beat BP) and cerebral vasoreg-
ulation (BFV in the middle cerebral artery MCA) can
be modeled as dynamic synchronization of two coupled
nonlinear systems. We further hypothesize that the CA
mechanism may also involve adjustments in the cerebral
vascular tone to spontaneous changes in BP that may be
present within a single heartbeat even when the system
is in the steady state and there are no signiﬁcant changes
in the mean blood pressure.

The synchronization phenomenon was ﬁrst observed
by Huygens for two coupled pendulum clocks [14], and
since then it has been found in many physical and bio-
logical systems where two or more coupled subsystems
interact [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Alternatively, the
synchronization may also be triggered by the inﬂuence of
external noisy or regular ﬁelds [22, 23]. In recent years,
the concept of synchronization has been widely used to
study the coupling of oscillating systems, leading to the
discovery of phase synchronization in non-identical cou-
pled systems in which the instantaneous phase is syn-
chronized, while their instantaneous amplitude remains
uncorrelated [24, 25, 26, 27].

In this study we evaluate the time-domain characteris-
tics of both the amplitudes and the instantaneous phases
of the BFV and BP which can be considered as two in-
teracting subsystems within the CA mechanism. To de-
termine the characteristics of the coupling between BP
and BFV in healthy subjects and how they change with
stroke, we analyze the cross-correlation between the in-
stantaneous phases of these two signals. We ﬁnd that this
cross-correlation is much stronger for stroke subjects, in-
dicating increased synchronization between BP and BFV,
which suggests impaired mechanism of the CA. We com-
pare the results of the synchronization analysis with those
obtained from the traditional transfer function method.

II. METHODS

Study Groups

Data were obtained at the Autonomic Nervous Sys-
tem Laboratory at the Department of Neurology at The
Ohio State University and at the SAFE (Syncope and
Falls in the Elderly) Laboratory at the Beth Israel Dea-
coness Medical Center at Harvard Medical School. All
subjects signed informed consent, approved by the In-
stitutional Review Boards. Demographic characteristics
are summarized in Table I. Control group: 11 healthy
subjects (age 48.2 ± 8.7 years). Stroke group: 13 sub-
jects with a ﬁrst minor ischemic stroke ( > 2 months
after acute onset) (age 52.8 ± 7.1 years). Post-stroke
subjects had a documented infarct aﬀecting < 1/3 of the
vascular territory as determined by MRI or CT with a

2

minor neurological deﬁcit (Modiﬁed Rankin Score scale
< 3). The side of the lesion was determined by neuro-
logical evaluation and conﬁrmed with MRI and CT. The
lesion was in the right hemisphere in 5 of the subjects
and in the left hemisphere in 8 of the subjects. Normal
carotid Doppler ultrasound study was required for par-
ticipation. Patients with hemorrhagic strokes, clinically
important cardiac disease including major arrhythmias,
diabetes and any other systemic illness were excluded.
All subjects were carefully screened with a medical his-
tory, physical and laboratory examination.

Experimental Protocol

All subjects participated in the following experimental

protocol:
• Baseline supine normocapnia: subject rests in supine
position for 5 minutes on a tilt table;
• Head-up tilt-upright normocapnia: The tilt table is
moved upright to an 80◦ angle. The subject remains in
upright position for 5 minutes and is breathing sponta-
neously;
• Hyperventilation-upright hypocapnia: the subject is
asked to breathe rapidly at ≈1 Hz frequency for 3 min-
utes in an upright position. Hyperventilation induces
hypocapnia (reduced carbon dioxide), which is associated
with cerebral vasoconstriction;
• CO2-rebreathing-upright hypercapnia: The subject is
asked to breath a mixture of air and 5% CO2 from re-
breathing circuit at a comfortable frequency for 3 min-
utes in an upright position. CO2-rebreathing increases
carbon dioxide above normal levels and induces hyper-
capnia, which is associated with vasodilatation.

The mechanism of CA is at least partially related to
the coupling between the metabolic demands and oxy-
gen supply to the brain [3]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is
one of the most potent chemical regulators of cerebral
vasoreactivity. Head-up tilt provides both pressure and
chemical stimulus - BFV and CO2 decline in upright po-
sition, reﬂecting the change in intracranial pressure and
shifting autoregulatory curve towards lower BP values.
There is a linear relationship between CO2 values and
cerebral blood ﬂow: hypocapnia (through hyperventila-
tion) causes vasoconstriction thus decrease the support of
blood ﬂow in brain, hypercapnia (through CO2 rebreath-
ing) causes vasodilatation and increase the support of
blood ﬂow in brain [3].

Data Acquisition

The experiments were done in the morning or more
than 2 hours after the last meal. The electrocardiogram
was measured from a modiﬁed standard lead II or III
using a Spacelab Monitor (SpaceLab Medical Inc., Is-
saquah, WA). Beat-to-beat BP was recorded from a ﬁn-
ger with a Finapres device (Ohmeda Monitoring Systems,
Englewood CO), which is based on a photoplethysmo-
graphic volume clamp method. During the study proto-
col, BP was veriﬁed by arterial tonometry. With ﬁnger

position at the heart level and temperature kept con-
stant, the Finapres device can reliably track intraarte-
rial BP changes over prolonged periods of time. Respi-
ratory waveforms were measured with a nasal thermis-
tor. CO2 was measured from a mask using an infrared
end tidal volume CO2 monitor (Datex Ohmeda, Madison
WI). The right and left MCAs were insonated from the
temporal windows, by placing the 2-MHz probe in the
temporal area above the zygomatic arch using a tran-
scranial Doppler ultrasonography system (MultiDop X4,
DWL Neuroscan Inc, Sterling, VA). Each probe was po-
sitioned to record the maximal BFV and ﬁxed at a de-
sired angle using a three-dimensional positioning system
attached to the light-metal probe holder. Special atten-
tion was given to stabilize the probes, since their steady
position is crucial for reliable, continuous BFV record-
ings. BFV and all cardiovascular analog signals were
continuously acquired on a beat-to-beat basis and stored
for oﬀ-line post-processing. Data were visually inspected
and occasional extrasystoles and outlier data points were
removed using linear interpolation. Fourier transform of
the Doppler shift (the diﬀerence between the frequency
of the emitted signal and its echo (frequency of reﬂected
signal) was used to calculate BFV. BFVs in the MCA
correlate with invasive measurements of blood ﬂow with
xenon clearance, laser Doppler ﬂux and positron emis-
sion tomography. Since MCA diameter is relatively con-
stant under physiological conditions, BFV can be used
for blood ﬂow estimates.

Statistical analysis

We use analysis of variance (MANOVA) with 2x4 de-
sign for two groups (control and stroke) and fours tests
(supine, tilt, hyperventilation, and CO2 rebreathing)

with subjects as nested random eﬀects (JMP version 5
Software Analysis Package, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
For each group and test, we have calculated the mean
BP, BFV, cerebral vascular resistance (CVR, calculated
by mean BP/BFV) from the right and the left MCAs,
CO2 as well as gain, phase and coherence from trans-
fer function analysis, and on the instantaneous phase
cross-correlation results obtained from the synchroniza-
tion analysis. Mean BFV on the stroke side were ob-
tained from the right MCA in ﬁve patients and from the
left MCA in 8 patients. Mean BFV from the opposite
MCA were considered as a normal side.
In the group
comparison, we have compared the stroke side BFV for
the stroke group to the BFV at the left side MCA for the
control group, while the normal side BFV for the stroke
group has been compared to the BFV at the right side
MCA for the control group.

Transfer function analysis

We ﬁrst normalize the BFV and BP signals to unit
standard deviation to obtain the respective signals V (t)
and P (t). We then calculate their respective Fourier
transforms V (f ) and P (f ).
In the frequency domain,
the coherence function γ2(f ) is deﬁned as

γ2(f ) =

|SP V (f )|2
SP P (f )SV V (f )

,

(1)

where SV V (f ) = |V (f )|2, SP P (f ) = |P (f )|2 and
SP V (f ) = P ∗(f )V (f ) are the power spectrum of V (t),
P (t) and the cross-spectrum of V (t) and P (t), respec-
tively. The value of the coherence function γ2(f ) varies
between 0 and 1. The transfer function H(f ) is deﬁned

if the original signal is sinαt, its Hilbert transform will
become cosαt. For any signal s(t) one can always con-
struct its “analytic signal” S [24, 25, 29, 30, 31], which
is deﬁned as

From the real part HR(f ) and imaginary part HI (f ) of
the transfer function, we can obtain its amplitude (also
called gain) |H(f ) = [H 2
I (f )]1/2| and its phase
R(f ) + H 2
Φ(f ) = arctan[HI (f )/HR(f )]. We note that the phase
Φ(f ) is a frequency domain characteristic of the cross-
spectrum between two signals, and is diﬀerent from the
instantaneous phase in the time domain we discuss in the
next section.

Phase synchronization

We study beat-to-beat BP-BFV interaction during
quasi-steady state conditions (supine, upright tilt, up-
right hyperventilation and CO2 rebreathing [Fig 1(a) and
(b)] employing a phase synchronization method. We
ﬁrst apply a high-pass (f > 0.05Hz) and a low-pass
(f < 10Hz) Fourier ﬁlter to the BFV and BP signals.
The high-pass ﬁlter is used to reduce the nonstationarity
in the signals. The low-pass ﬁlter is used to remove high
frequency random ﬂuctuations in the signals. Next we
perform the Hilbert Transform which for a time series
s(t) is deﬁned as [24, 25, 29, 30, 31]

where P denotes Cauchy Principal value. ˜s(t) has an
apparent physical meaning in Fourier space: for any pos-
itive (negative) frequency f , the Fourier component of
the Hilbert transform ˜s(t) at this frequency f can be ob-
tained from the Fourier component of the original signal
s(t) at the same frequency f after a 90◦ clockwise (anti-
clockwise) rotation in the complex plane. For example,

S ≡ s(t) + ˜s(t) = A(t)eiϕ(t),

(4)

where A(t) and ϕ(t) are the instantaneous amplitude and
phase of s(t), respectively. The amplitude A(t) and the
phase ϕ(t) are instantaneous characteristics of a time se-
ries s(t), and present diﬀerent aspects of the signal. For
a pure sinusoid, the instantaneous amplitude is a con-
stant and the instantaneous phase is a straight line over
time: the amplitude quantiﬁes the strength of the oscil-
lation and the slope of the straight line quantiﬁes how
fast is the oscillation. For more complex signals, both
the instantaneous amplitude and phase may display com-
plicated forms. We note that, the result of the Hilbert
transform does not depend on the mean of the original
signal s(t), thus for two signals s(t) and s(t) + const,
one will obtain identical values for ˜s(t). However, such a
shift in the mean value of s(t) will aﬀect the amplitude
A(t) and the phase ϕ(t) of the analytical signal. Since
we have ﬁrst applied a high-pass ﬁlter in the frequency
domain (f > 0.05 Hz), the mean of s(t) becomes zero and
the instantaneous amplitude and phase we obtained are
uniquely deﬁned. Further we note that the instantaneous
phase ϕ(t) is diﬀerent from the transfer function phase
Φ(f ) — ϕ(t) is a time domain characteristic of a single
signal, while Φ(f ) is a cross-spectrum characteristic of
two signals in the frequency domain.

The instantaneous phase ϕ(t) for both BFV and BP is
a nonstationary signal and can be decomposed into two
parts: a linear trend and ﬂuctuations along the trend.
The trend is mainly driven by the periodic heart rate at
a frequency ≈ 1 Hz. However, the ﬂuctuations are of
speciﬁc interest since they may be aﬀected by the cere-

associated with each heartbeat in ∆ϕ for the BP signal from a healthy subject (c) are not matched by corresponding patterns
in the BFV signal (d), reﬂecting active cerebral vascular regulation. In contrast, periodic patterns in ∆ϕ of the BP signal from
a stroke subject (g) are matched by practically identical patterns in ∆ϕ of the BFV signal (h), indicating dramatic impairment

bral autoregulation. To remove the trend, we consider
the increments in the consecutive values of the instanta-
neous phase, deﬁned as ∆ϕ(ti) = ϕ(ti) − ϕ(ti−1), where
ti and ti−1 are the time corresponding to two successive
recordings (in our case we have ti − ti−1 = 0.02sec). The
instantaneous phase increment signal ∆ϕ is stationary,
and ﬂuctuates in the range (−π, π). In Fig. 2 (c-d) we
show examples of ∆ϕ for healthy subjects and in Fig. 2
(g-h) for stroke subjects.

We then apply a cross-correlation analysis to quantify
the dynamical relationship between the stationary phase
increments ∆ϕ of the BFV and BP signals. For each
subject, during each one of the four physiologic condi-

tions we calculate the correlation coeﬃcient C(τ ) vs. the
time lag τ between the BFV and BP signals. To quan-
titatively distinguish the control group and the stroke
group, we further analyze the characteristics of the cor-
relation function C(τ ). Speciﬁcally, we investigate the
maximum value of C(τ ), denoted as Cmax, which repre-
sents the strength of the cross-correlation between the in-
stantaneous phases of the BFV and BP signals. Another
important characteristic of the cross-correlation function
is how fast the correlation between two signals decreases
for increasing values of the time lag τ . To quantify this
aspect, we choose a ﬁxed threshold value, r = 0.3, which
is the same for all subjects. Since C(τ ) is a periodic-like

function of the time lag τ with a decreasing amplitude
for increasing τ (Fig. 3), we ﬁrst record all maxima of
|C(τ )| during each heart beat period (∼1 sec), then we
determine the two maxima with largest positive and neg-
ative time lags τ at which the correlation function C(τ )
is above rCmax. The average of the absolute values for
these two time lags is marked as a characteristic time lag
τ0.

III. RESULTS

Mean values.

We compare the mean values of all signals for both con-
trol and stroke groups and for all four conditions (base-
line, upright tilt, tilt-hyperventilation and CO2 rebreath-
ing) and groups (control and stroke) using MANOVA.
Results are shown in Table I. We ﬁnd that the mean val-
ues of the BFV and CO2 signals are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
for the four diﬀerent conditions while the BP signal has
a mean value similar for all four conditions. For control
and stroke group comparison, we ﬁnd that BFVs from
the left (stroke side) MCA were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent,
and that the mean value of BP for the stroke group is
signiﬁcantly higher than that for control group. Further-
more, we observe that the cerebral vascular resistance
(CVR) is signiﬁcantly higher for the stroke group.
Transfer function analysis.

We apply transfer function analysis on the original
BFV and BP signals under diﬀerent tests in both the
low frequency (LF) LF (0.05-0.2 Hz) and the heart beat
frequency (HBF) (0.7-1.4 Hz) range. Gain, phase and
coherence are calculated for each subject and for all four
physiologic conditions (Table II). We use MANOVA to
compare our results for the two groups and for the four
conditions. In both frequency ranges, we do not ﬁnd sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence in the gain. In the LF range, phase
Φ(f ) and coherence γ2(f ) are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent be-
tween the tests, but are not diﬀerent between the groups.
In the HBF range, we ﬁnd that the phase Φ(f ) for the
MCAL-BFV is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the condi-
tions (p=0.03). The coherence in the HBF range shows
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the tests comparison, however,
it is signiﬁcantly higher for the control group.
Phase synchronization analysis.

We apply the phase synchronization analysis to all four
conditions and both study groups. We ﬁnd that the pat-
terns of cross-correlation function C(τ ) of the instanta-
neous phase increments ∆ϕ of the BFV and BP signals
are very diﬀerent for the stroke group compared to the
control group. In general, the cross-correlation function
C(τ ) for the control group is characterized by smaller
amplitude and faster decay (time lag τ less than 10 secs)
[Fig. 3]. In contrast, for stroke subjects, the amplitude of
the cross-correlation function C(τ ) has much larger am-
plitude and decayes much slower (over time lags larger
than 10 secs) [Fig. 3]. Because of the strong correlation
between BFV and BP signals, for those stroke patients

6

the changes of the phase of BFV will change in the ap-
proximately same way with that of BP signals, indicating
a strong synchronization.

The correlations at short time scales (less than 10
seconds) may be partially attributed to the eﬀect of
heart rate (∼1 sec) and respiration (∼5 secs)— i.e.,
they reﬂect the eﬀect of other body regulations (simi-
lar to“background noise”) on both BFV and BP signals.
When cerebral autoregulation is eﬀective, because of its
fast-acting mechanism [3], it may also contribute to the
signiﬁcantly weaker cross-correlations at short time scales
we ﬁnd in healthy subjects compared to post-stroke sub-
jects (Fig. 3). However, the correlation due to the above
mechanisms will decrease very fast when increasing the
time lag τ between BFV and BP signals. Thus, the corre-
lations at long time scales (>10 secs) observed for stroke
subjects (Fig. 3), cannot be attributed to the eﬀect of
cerebral autoregulation.
Instead, the existence of such
strong and sustained cross-correlations may imply that
BFV will passively follow the changes of BP, thus indi-
cating absence of vascular dilation or constriction and
impaired cerebral autoregulation for the stroke subjects.

To quantitatively distinguish control group and stroke
group, we have studied the characteristics of the correla-
tion function C(τ ) for all subjects. For each correlation
function C(τ ), we ﬁrst ﬁnd Cmax, the maximal value of
C(τ ), which tells the strength of the correlation. Then
we choose a threshold value, e.g., r = 0.3, search for the
maximum of |C(τ )| during each heart beat period along
both positive and negative lags, and ﬁnd two points in
those maxima with largest time lags at which the cor-
relation are still above rCmax. The average of absolute
values of these two points gives the characteristic time
lags τ0. From τ0 and Cmax for all subjects and during all
tests, one can conﬁrm that the stroke group tends to have
larger Cmax and longer time lag τ0 compared to those for
the control group.

We have applied MANOVA to demonstrate whether
τ0 and Cmax are diﬀerent for control subjects and stroke
patients. The results are shown in Table III. We ﬁnd
that during tilt and hyperventilation tests, control and
stroke group indicate no signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p values
> 0.05).
In contrast, in supine and CO2 re-breathing
tests, the diﬀerence between the control group and the
stroke group becomes signiﬁcant (p values < 0.05).

To explain the above diﬀerence in τ0 and Cmax in the
supine stage, we note that stroke group had higher BP
and CO2 in baseline (see Table I). Therefore, BP au-
toregulatory curve for the stroke subjects was shifted to
the right or higher BP values while the plateau of this
curve was already narrowed because of the higher level
of CO2 [3]. Tilt CO2 rebreathing increased CO2 after a
period of hypocapnia, thus further tested the CO2 reac-
tivity and showed impaired vasodilatatory responses in
stroke subjects. In contrast, vasoconstrictor responses to
tilt-up hyperventilation were preserved.

FIG. 3: Cross-correlation function C(τ ) of the instantaneous phase increment ∆ϕ for the BFV and BP signals during four
physiologic conditions. We ﬁnd that the cross-correlation function for all healthy subjects exhibits a very distinct type of
behavior compared to stroke subjects. Two typical examples are shown (Left) A healthy subject: C(τ ) has a small amplitude
at τ = 0 and is close to zero at time lags τ < 5 secs., during all four conditions. (Right) A stroke patient: C(τ ) has a much
larger amplitude at τ = 0 which lasts for lags τ up to 20 seconds, indicating a strong synchronization between the BFV and
BP signals, i.e., loss of cerebral autoregulation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this study we investigate dynamics of cerberal au-
toregulation from relationship between BP and BFV sig-
nals in control and stroke groups. We compare the sta-
tistical properties of BFV and BP signals as well as the
synchronization between them. We evaluate the com-
bined eﬀects of pressure autoregulation (upright tilt)
and metabolic autoregulation (hyperventilation and CO2
rebreathing) in healthy and post-stroke subjects. We
apply a synchronization method (based on the Hilbert
transform) to quantify the possible phase relations be-
tween the BFV and BP signals. We ﬁnd that the cross-
correlation between the instantaneous phase increments
obtained from the BFV and BP signals provides insight
into the dynamics of BP-BFV regulation in healthy and
post-stroke subjects. Our results for stroke patients show
a stronger and more sustained synchronization between
BFV and BP signals in supine and CO2 rebreathing,
which cannot be simply explained by heart rate and/or
respiration. Such robust synchronization pattern is not
apparent in control subjects, and indicates impaired cere-

8

bral autoregulation for chronic stroke patients. Stronger
BP-BFV synchronization in the stroke subjects may re-
ﬂect higher vascular resistance and the eﬀects of slower
vasomotor BP rhythms on cerebral blood ﬂow.
In the
controls, these eﬀects may be attenuated by the myo-
genic regulation. This synchronization method enables
to assess dynamics of phase relationship on a beat-to-
beat basis that can be applied to assess dynamics of va-
soregulation.

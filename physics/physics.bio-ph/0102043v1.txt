Abstract

The evolution in coding DNA sequences brings new ﬂexibility and freedom to the codon

words, even as the underlying nucleotides get signiﬁcantly ordered. These curious contra-rules

of gene organisation are observed from the distribution of words and the second moments of the

nucleotide letters. These statistical data give us the physics behind the classiﬁcation of bacteria.

Over the years the statistical approach to genes has become prominent. The hidden Markov

models are used in the alignment routines of biological sequences [1]. For the secondary structures of

the sequences stochastic context-free and context-sensitive grammars [2] are applied [3]. The recent

discovery of the fractal inverse power-law correlations [4] in these biological chains have led to ideas

that statistically these sequences have features of music and languages [5-7]. Languages evolve with

time. The vocabulary increases; the rules that dominate get progressively optimised so the order

and information content is more. The purpose of this work is to track the statistical basis of the

evolution in the coding DNA sequences (CDS).

The CDS are multiple of 3-tuples, the codons. The nucleotides adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine

(G) and thymine (T) taken in groups of three work to build the amino acid chains called proteins.

The word-structure of CDS is, therefore, well known. We want to study evolution in terms of these

words, their distributions and the moments.

It is known that any prose does not carry all the ingredients of evolution of languages. Similarly

the CDS of any gene does not have all the salient features that accompany change. The genes that

are present in the whole range of organisms, from the lowest bacteria to the highest mammals, and

therefore connected to fundamental life processes are normally considered to be best suited to function

as evolutionary markers. With this in view we choose glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase

(GAPDH) CDS for its ubiquitous presence in all living beings. The enzyme it codes for catalyses

one of the crucial energy-producing steps of glycolysis, the common pathway for both aerobic and

2

anaerobic respiration.

Distribution of words is studied for languages. The frequency of words is plotted against the

rank. Here the total number of occurrences of a particular word is termed its frequency. The word

most frequent has rank=1, the next most has rank=2, and so on. For natural languages, the plot

gives the Zipf [8] behaviour:

fN =

f1
N

where N stands for the rank and f1 and fN are the frequencies of words of rank 1 and N respectively.

The Zipf-type approach to the study of DNA has brought methods of statistical linguistics into DNA

analysis [6]. The generalized Zipf distribution of n-tuples has provided hints that the DNA sequences

may have some structural features common to languages. In this work we conﬁne ourselves to the

distribution of 3-tuples, the codons, in the CDS. The words, therefore, are non-overlapping and on

the single reading frame.

exponential functional form [9]:

The frequency-vs-rank plot of the codon words show that these distributions, given the frequency

of rank 1 and the length of the sequence, are almost completely deﬁned through the universal

The parameter, called β, is determined by the ratio

β measures the frequency of rank 1 per unit length of the sequence. The exponential form (2) is

to be compared to the usual Boltzmann distribution. The rank of the word is akin to energy; β is

analogous to inverse temperature. The relationship (3) that β is frequency of rank 1 per unit length

is supported well from data [9]. The analogy between word distributions and the classical Boltzmann

concepts goes deeper. A decrease in β, from (3), implies frequency of rank 1 per unit length goes

down. In that case the vocabulary clearly increases. More words are used, thereby more states are

accessed. For the GAPDH CDS we ﬁnd the evolution is driving it to higher temperatures; into more

freedom for words, into more randomisation. β evolves monotonically.

Underneath, however, there runs a curious counterﬂow. Suppose we look into the nucleotides

that constitute the sequence, once again in windows of size 3 and in the same reading frame. First,

we ask how much order there is in the sequence. To ﬁnd out we study the second moments of the

letters A, C, G and T. These second moments, by themselves, do not produce any pattern. The

GAPDH CDS has about 1000 bases. For each organism the proportions of A, C, G and T in the

GAPDH CDS are diﬀerent. This strand-bias, interestingly, masks a remarkable underlying trend.

To get there the strand-bias has to be eliminated. The order in the sequence, we assume, is its

deviation from the random. We deﬁne the quantity X, a measure of this deviation, as follows:

X =

Second M oment of the Base Distribution in GAP DH CDS
Second M oment of the Base Distribution in the random sequence with identical strand bias

4

Normalised as above, the eﬀect of the strand bias is unmasked. X values of GAPDH change mono-

tonically with evolution. The data tells us there is an increase in persistence amongst the letters (in

windows of size 3) with evolution in the CDS [10].

The evolution in the GAPDH CDS is then the result of these two contra trends: while words

acquire greater uniformisation, the underlying letters have more order. The monotonic behaviours

of β and X with evolution give us the physics behind the biological classiﬁcation of bacteria.

For the codons it is known [9] the exponentials give somewhat better ﬁts over the usual power laws.

The exponential form, equation (2), is characterized by the parameter β. The quantity has some

universal features in that it is almost completely determined by f1 and the length of the CDS. The

is (nA, nC, nG, nT ), then, clearly,

and ni (i ≡ A,C,G,T), is the number of nucleotide of type i in the sequence just walked.

If the sequence has n bases, and ni is the number of base of type i, the strand bias of the sequence

is the proportion of ni in n, deﬁned as

measure the deviation of the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal second moments of the sequence to those

of the random sequence of identical strand bias respectively. Finally, we come up with an over-all

averaged index, X, given by

X = P XD + P XOD

This X provides a measure of the order in the sequences.

Observations and Results

To set the basis for what we discuss later, we begin by recording the β and the X values of higher

organisms, the eukaryotes (Table 1). We conﬁne our discussion of the eukaryotes to three broad

categories: fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. It is known [13] from fossil records the oldest fungi

came about 900 million years (Myr) before present (bp). The oldest fungal species, identiﬁed with

certainty, are from the Ordovician period, i.e., some 500 Myr bp. The fossil records of invertebrates

suggest this group came about the same time as the fungi. The vertebrates came later, about 400

Myr bp, in late Ordovician and Silurian period.

Let us look at the β and the X values of these eukaryotic groups. Fungi has the highest, followed

by invertebrates, while for the vertebrates the β and the X reach minima. We conclude the β and

the X decrease with evolution. The data further suggest fungi and invertebrates came about the

same time and underwent parallel evolution, while the representives of the vertebrate group came

later in the evolutionary line-up.

Having set the basis, let us now look at 14 bacterial species from three groups: cyanobacteria,

proteobacteria (that includes vast majority of gram-negative bacteria), and the Bacillus/Clostridium

group, a type of gram-positive bacteria. Table 2 summarises the β and the X values of these samples.

These bacterial groups arose during the Precambrian period of geological time-scale, but there are

several schools of thought regarding their speciﬁc times of origin within this period.

We approach the bacterial GAPDH CDS with two diﬀering statistical measures, the β and the

8

X.

Interestingly, both give us almost identical trends (Figs. 1 and 2). Lactobacillus delbrueckii,

a member of the Bacillus/Clostridium group, has the highest β and X values (Table 2). There

is then a large measure of overlap between the Bacillus/Clostridium group and the proteobacteria

(Figs. 1 and 2). The extent of overlap of the β values is somewhat more than that of the X. The

cyanobacterial samples have the minimum values of the β and the X. There is no overlap between the

cyanobacterial values of the β and the X with the Bacillus/Clostridium group. The overlap between

the proteobacteria and the cyanobacteria is small. Only one proteobacterial sample, Brucella abortus

has greater β value than the cyanobacterial member, Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803).

The averages of the β or the X has the maximum value in the Bacillus/Clostridium group,

followed by the proteobacteria, while the cyanobacteria samples have the lowest values. In line with

our observations on the eukaryotes, we propose (Figs. 1 and 2) that the Bacillus/Clostridium group

originated some time before the proteobacterial species, but later both groups evolved in parallel.

The cyanobacterial samples are of recent origin compared to these groups. The trends in the β and

the X give us identical patterns that segregate the bacterial species into groups. Amusingly, the

results seem to be in agreement with what is accepted so far regarding the phylogenetic relationships

among these three groups [14]. Our study of the GAPDH CDS, its word distributions, and the

moments gives us the physics underlying evolution.

The decrease in β with evolution for the GAPDH CDS tells us that evolution is taking the gene

progressively towards higher temperatures. The β value, we recall, is the frequency of rank one per

9

unit length. Lowering of the β implies less dominance of the maximum weight.

In consequence,

the other words enjoy greater freedom, the vocabulary increases and more states are accessed. In a

sense the evolution in the GAPDH CDS mirrors Boltzmannian statistics. Even though the GAPDH

CDS has evolved in a complex evolutionary regime in contact with environment, the Boltzmannian

behaviour is useful. For instance, it allows us to deﬁne the word-entropy of the CDS. That gives us

a measure of the information content of the words in biological chain.

At the level of the nucleotide letters A, C, G and T, the order is measured by the quantity X.

As we look into the diagonal averages XD, (12), we ﬁnd it increases with evolution. For the window

of size 3, this growing diagonal moment implies a rising persistent correlation. In consequence, the

oﬀ-diagonal averages XOD, (13), go down, decreasing antipersistence. Looked at from the letters, the

sequences become less uniform and deviate more from the random sequence of identical strand bias.

The order, or the information, in the arrangement of letters shows a rising trend with evolution.

Does any CDS that is an evolutionary marker evolve in ways similar to the GAPDH? We have

worked with the CDS of some other glycotic enzymes, such as phosphoglycerate kinase, and found

they behave similarly. Other evolutionary markers such as the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxy-

lase/oxygenase enzyme large segment (rbcL) show similar behaviour. We use these data for biological

subclassiﬁcation. The CDS for ribosomal RNA is another class of sequence that is being investigated.

It does not code for protein, but for RNA, and has periods other than 3. The 3 period does exist,

but is not predominant.

10

Sequence modeling has recently become important. The fractal correlations in the sequences led

to the expansion-modiﬁcation system [15]. Later came the insertion models [16]. Here the diﬀerences

in the CDS and non-coding sequences were observed and the non-coding sequences modeled. The

unifying models of copying-mistake-maps [17] modeled both the coding and the non-coding parts.

In these models the statistical features of the non-coding sequences have received emphasis. The

evolutionary features of the GAPDH CDS isolates the statistical aspects that underlie evolution in

coding sequences. The statistics of the word distributions and the subtle cross current of the second

moments, we hope, will lead further in these eﬀorts.

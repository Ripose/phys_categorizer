Abstract

In this paper we ﬁnd an analytical solution of the equilibrium ion distribution
for a toroidal model of a ionic channel, using the Perfect Screening Theorem
(PST)[1]. The ions are charged hard spheres, and are treated using a variational
Mean Spherical Approximation (VMSA) [2].

Understanding ion channels is still a very open problem, because of the
many exquisite tuning details of real life channels. It is clear that the electric
ﬁeld plays a major role in the channel behaviour, and for that reason there has
been a lot of work on simple models that are able to provide workable theories.
Recently a number of interesting papers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] have appeared
that discuss models in which the eﬀect of the geometry, excluded volume and
non-linear behaviour is considered.

We present here a 3D model of ionic channels which consists of a charged,
deformable is a torus with a circular or elliptical cross section, which can be ﬂat
or vertical (close to a cylinder). Extensive comparisons to MC simulations were
performed.

The new solution opens new possibilities, such as studying ﬂexible pores [12],
and water phase transformations inside the pores using an approach similar to
that used on ﬂat crystal surfaces [13, 14]

1 Introduction

We dedicate this contribution to Prof. Ben Widom, one of the leading ﬁgures
in Statistical Mechanics.
The study of the transport process in membrane ion channels is complicated by
the presence of the protein walls, the interaction with ions, water molecules and
the electric ﬁeld proﬁle, which determine many of the salient properties of ion
channels. Computing the electric potential proﬁle everywhere in a real channel
is diﬃcult, if not impossible, because of the complexity of the system, and for
that reason simpliﬁed models have been used: Kuyucak et al [4, 5], have studied
circular toroidal channels using the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation, in which
the ions are treated as point charges. Excluded volume eﬀects have been in-
cluded [8, 10, 11] to explain ion selectivity. Furthermore nonlinear eﬀects, which

1

are important, are included in the 1D, non-linear Poisson Boltzmann PNP mod-
els of Eisenberg et al.[9, 10, 11]. Excluded volume eﬀects come into play when
molecular solvents are used[6, 7]. Recently the eﬀects on porin arising from the
rotation of water molecules were discussed[13].

We propose here a new VMSA solution [2] of a ion channel model which
consists of a toroidal ring with either circular or elliptical (prolate or oblate)
cross section. The major feature of our solution is that it satisﬁes the Perfect
Screening Theorems (PST)[1]. This is not only a physical requirement, but also
a technical advantage, because it can used to include discrete molecular solvents
such as hard dipoles [15], and water [16]. This has been used in the theory of a
phase transition that involves the turning of water by an electric ﬁeld[14].

The non-linear Poisson-Bolztmann case has been discussed elsewhere [17, 18]

and as a matter of fact, is implicit in our present work.

To study the dynamics of ions in a channel, one needs to compute the forces
acting on each of the ions , including mobile,induced and ﬁxed charges and the
applied electrical ﬁeld.This could be coupled with Brownian dynamics simu-
lations or other coarse grained simulations. Because this computation has to
be repeated at every step, the existence of analytical solutions in a relevant
geometry is imperative for simulations at realistic time scales.

1.1 The perfect screening sum rule

One remarkable property of mixtures of classical charged particles is that be-
cause of the very long range of the electrostatic forces, they must create a
neutralizing atmosphere of counterions, which shields perfectly any charge or
ﬁxed charge distribution. Otherwise the partition function, and therefore all
the thermodynamic functions, will be divergent [1]. This sum rule is intuitive
and widely accepted for spherical systems. It has been explicitly veriﬁed for non
spherical systems in simulations and also using exact results for the Jancovici
model [19, 20].

For spherical ions this means that the internal energy E of the ions is always
the sum of the energies of spherical capacitors. For spherical ions the capacitor
is a spherical capacitor, and the exact form of the energy is

∆E = −

e2
ε Xi

ρizi

zi
1/Γi + σi

,

(1)

β = 1/kT is the usual Boltzmann thermal factor, ε is the dielectric constant, e
is the elementary charge, and ions i have charge, diameter and density zi, σi,
ρi, respectively. Γi is the shielding length for ion i.

For non spherical systems the perfect screening theorem requires that all
multipoles of the ﬁxed charge distributions be compensated by the mobile charge
distribution. As we will see below this implies a very substantial simpliﬁcation

2

of the solution of linear PB equation since every multipole of the countercharges
distribution cancels the ﬁxed charges multipoles and all cross terms are zero.

2 The charged torus

Analyical solutions of closures of the OZ or (WOZ) are only possible in odd
parity spaces. The torus is an even parity, 2-dimensional object, and for that
reason there is no direct analytical solution possible of the MSA or LPB. The
expansion in spherical harmonics on the other hand is always possible and for
our model is convergent within a reasonable (even small!) number of spherical
harmonics [23]. The beauty of the PST is that it de-couples all the multipole
terms, and for that reason we are able to solve the LPBE to all orders in closed
form. Poisson’s equation for the potential in a charged system is [21]

∇2φ(r) =

q(r),

4π
ǫ

Here the charge density q(r) at r is the sum of the ﬁxed ring and the mobile ion
charges

q(r) = qring(r) +

qi(r)

Xi

where φ(r) is the potential at r ≡ R, z .

The formal solution of this equation is

However, the inhomogeneous Poisson equation (2) has no closed form analytical
solution. We need to expand our problem in a suitable basis. We use spherical
harmonics expansion because its good analytical behavior (it has been exten-
sively used in astrophysics [23]), but more important, because of the PST [1]

the terms are decoupled to each order in the expansion. For the ring source po-
tential there are three regions which correspond to outside and inside a sphere
of radius a of the ring.

3 The Solution of the Linear Poisson Boltzmann
Equation (LPBE) and the Variational MSA

But the LPBE is accurate only for very dilute solutions because the ions are
point charges. The MSA is the LPBE, but with the mathematically correct
treatment of the excluded volume eﬀects. The MSA which is derived from the
Mean Spherical Model [24, 25, 26, 27],and provides a coherent and simple de-
scription of the properties of a large class of systems in terms of a very small
set of scaling parameters Γα This includes ionic solutions, water and polyelec-
trolytes [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. Since the excluded volume is treated
exactly in the MSA this theory satisﬁes the Onsager bounds [37, 38, 40], and is
asymptotically exact at large concentrations. In fact, from the detailed solution
one sees that in the MSA there are some simple transformations that lead to
the proper high density behaviour. The Debye screening length κ in the DH
theory becomes the MSA screening length Γ

It can be shown that the proper high density behaviour in the MSA stems

from the fact that the entropy is of the form

where kB is the Boltzmann constant. For nonspherical systems this generalizes
to[15]

∆S(MSA) = −kB

∆S(MSA) = −kB

(14)

where χ is the index of the irreducible representation [39] and ℓ is the order of
the spherical harmonic in eq.(9). This immediately suggests [40, 2] that Γχ can
be determined by the variational expression

∂[β∆Aχ(Γχ)]
∂Γχ

=

∂[β∆Eχ(Γχ) + Γ3

χ/(3π)]

∂Γχ

= 0

(16)

For the simple restricted case of an equal size ionic mixture we get equation
(13). For more complex systems, like the general polyelectrolyte this equation
is a new relation to be found. For ﬂexible polyelectrolytes it has been derived
from the BIMSA [40, 42, 48].

In the present paper we use the method for rigid rings. The method is very
simple: We obtain a solution of the linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory that sat-
isﬁes the perfect screening theorem (PST)[1]. Then the VMSA parameter is
computed.

As was discussed elsewhere [2, 12, 40] it has been shown that in the many cases
where an analytical solution of the MSA, for complex systems is available, the

of the MSA is very complex, but even the extension of eq.(13) is a quite decent

4 Computer Simulations

The geometry of the system is displayed in Figure 1. We have chosen this model
because it is closest to actual channel geometry [3, 4]. As is shown in ﬁgure 1 we
can stretch or ﬂatten the torus so that it can be a narrow channel or just a pore
in a ﬂat membrane. In our solution this means that we merely have to increase
the number of multipoles in the expansion eq.(9). As was shown by Tohline et
al. the expansion of toroidal systems using spherical harmonics can be carried
out up to quite large values of ℓ ≃ 1000 [23]. We simulate a cylindrical section
torus for which only a few terms are needed (typically 3 or 4). We use standard
Monte Carlo simulation techniques [52, 53, 54] Our entire system is conﬁned
to a large sphere, and our charged ring is lying ﬂat in the x-y plane, so that
z = 0 is the plane of the ring. Typically the radius of the sphere is 20-26 times
the ionic diameter, although runs have been performed with larger spheres to
assure that the inﬂuence of the walls is reasonably small. The number of ions
varied between 200 and 512. The sampling bins were cylindrical sections, which
makes the data near the axis of the torus particularly noisy. For that reason we
have used extremely long runs ( 108 steps in some cases) and even so we had to
discard the noisy central region.

The results of ﬁgures 2 and 3 for the charge distributions in the x-y plane

are well represented by eq.(34), using the ﬁrst two terms in the expansion.

In our simulations there are no large multipoles produced by the periodic

boundary conditions, which could cause violations of the PST [1].

5 Discussion of Results

We have presented here a theory of the equilibrium distribution of ions in a
charged channel that is surprisingly simple. The fact that so few parameters
can describe the distribution of charges inside and outside the channel is very
appealing. a feture of our approach is that it can be easily extended to include
the solvent and discrete structures. Because of the availability of an analytical
solution of the octupolar model of water[14] it is another deﬁnite possibility.
The simplicity of the result is very intriguing, and we certainly will explore the
possibilities of this approach.

ABSTRACT We introduce a Markov model for the gating of membrane channels. The
model features a possible solution to the so–called gating current paradox, namely that
the bell–shaped curve that describes the voltage dependence of the kinetics is broader
than expected from, and shifted relative to, the sigmoidal curve that describes the voltage
dependence of the activation. The model also predicts some temperature dependence of
this shift, but presence of the latter has not been tested experimentally so far.

INTRODUCTION
The gating of membrane channels is of vital importance for the electrophysiological activity
of nerve, heart and muscle. While some of these channels appear to have fractal–like gating
(Liebovitch, 1995), most membrane channels do display activity that can be well approx-
imated by a simple Markov process (Korn and Horn, 1988). However, Clay et al. (1995)
revealed a gating current paradox that has been diﬃcult to explain with a standard type
(Hille, 1992) Markov model. The paradox is that the bell–shaped curve that describes the
voltage dependence of the kinetics is shifted signiﬁcantly relative to the sigmoidal curve that
describes the voltage dependence of the activation. The standard type models (Hille, 1992)
does not allow such a shift. Also the former curve is broader than the one predicted by the
standard model.

Here we introduce a new Markov model, that extends and generalizes the standard one.
Our generalization consists of introducing an alternative route between the open and the
closed positions of the gate. With two routes, or two membrane protein folding pathways, we
are able to obtain results consistent with the observed ones. Thus such a model presents a
possible resolution of the above paradox. A more complete resolution requires investigation
of the detailed physical mechanism present in real membrane channels to see how they
compare with the model. The idea with two routes, a rapid one and a slow one, is that the
probability of choosing one or the other also depends upon the voltage through a Boltzmann
factor. This will aﬀect the kinetics, but not the equilibrium distribution (stationary state),
and a relative shift of curves can take place.

THE MODEL
We imagine that a membrane channel has one open and one closed state as in the simplest
standard (Hille, 1992) Markov model for this problem. However, between these states we
now assume that there exist two routes (i = 1, 2). This gives,

α1⇋
β1C
α2⇋
β2

O ,

(1)

where the rate constants α1, α2 and β1, β2, which are functions of voltage (but are constant
at any given voltage), control the transitions between the closed (C) and the open (O) states
of the gate. The αi is the rate for a closed channel to open, and βi the rate for an open
channel to close. We introduce eﬀective rate constants α and β,

where the probabilities p1 and p2 are related in a standard way to the diﬀerence ∆Gb in
energy barriers that must be overcome for each of the two routes,

α = p1α1 + p2α2
β = p1β1 + p2β2 ,

Let x denote the average fraction of gates that are open, or, equivalently, the probability
that a given gate will be open, and let us imagine that a Markov (1906) model is suitable
to describe the gating. One then has, as usual

where

Here x∞ denotes the steady stationary state fraction of open gates and τ the relaxation
time. At equilibrium, the probability for a channel to be in the open state is x∞, and the
probability to be in the closed state is (1 − x∞). The ratio of these two probabilities is given
by the Boltzmann distribution,

where T is the absolute temperature, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and ∆Gx denote the energy
diﬀerence between the open and the closed positions. Thus,

At equilibrium, each of the the forward reactions must occur just as frequently as each of
the reverse reactions, giving,

This is the principle of detailed balance which is present in dynamical systems (reversible
mechanics). As in the standard model the rates are then assumed to be,

where λi is assumed to be independent of ∆Gx. Thus the relaxation time (Eq. 8) can then
be written as,

To be more speciﬁc the voltage dependences of ∆Gx and ∆Gb are needed. For the energy
diﬀerence between the open state and the closed state we assume as usual,

∆Gx = Gclosed − Gopen ≡ qx(v − vx) − sxT ,

where the term qxvx is due to the diﬀerence in mechanical conformation energy between
the two states; qxv represents the electrical potential energy change associated with the
redistribution of charge during the transition, and sx is due to the diﬀerence in entropy
between the two states. A similar expression can be assumed for the energy diﬀerence
between the two barriers in route 1 and 2,

∆Gb = G1 − G2 ≡ qb(v − vb) − sbT .

(22)

Here v is voltage, while qx, vx, sx, qb, vb, and sb are constants. One notes that the curve for
the relaxation time τ has a shift in position due to the term γ. Inserted for the special case
∆Gb = ∆Gx the above yields,

Here we ﬁnd that the voltage dependence of the curve for the relaxation time (Eq. 24)
is shifted by an amount 2γkT /qx relative to the steady state activation curve (Eq. 23),
which means that the magnitude of the shift depends upon temperature. With ∆Gb 6= ∆Gx
expression (Eq. 24) becomes more complex as follows from (Eq. 18), and the shape of the
former curve is modiﬁed. This however, is dealt with in the next section.

RESULTS
We now will compare the model with the experimental results of Clay et al. (1995) and show
that it is consistent with the latter. Thus it presents a mechanism that represents a possible
solution to the gating current paradox. The temperature–dependence of the currents were
not considered in those experiments, so here sx and sb can be incorporated into vx and vb.
With use of Eqs. 21 and 22, Eqs. 10 and 18 become,

where kx = kT /qx and kb = kT /qb. These expressions were evaluated numerically adjusting
the parameters present to obtain a best possible ﬁt to the experimental data. A least
squares ﬁt weighting various points in accordance with experimental uncertainty was used.
The results of this evaluation is shown in the ﬁgure below where the data of Clay et al.
(1995) is presented together with the curves given by Eqs. 25 and 26 using the parameters
shown in the ﬁgure text.
However, the curves are not very sensitive to the values of these parameters except γ, so they
can be varied quite a bit and still give essentially the same curves. From these curves we
ﬁnd that the model is fully consistent with the experimental results within the uncertainties
in the latter.

DISCUSSION
We have presented a Markov model that yields a possible solution to the gating current
paradox announced by Clay et al. (1995).
It gives a simple explanation of the voltage–
shift of the bell–shaped curve for the relaxation time relative to the steady state activation
curve. Also the width and shape of the relaxation time curve can be modiﬁed in a way
consistent with experiments. A novel feature of the present model is that the voltage–shift
is temperature dependent. It is not clear whether such a temperature dependence can be
observed experimentally.

Mechanical unfolding of polyproteins by force spectroscopy provides valuable insight into their
free energy landscapes. Most phenomenological models of the unfolding process are two-state and/or
one dimensional, with the details of the protein and its dynamics often subsumed into a zero-force
unfolding rate and a single distance x1D
u to the transition state. We consider the entire phase space
of a model protein under a constant force, and show that the distance x1D
contains a sizeable
u
contribution from exploring the full multidimensional energy landscape. Proteins with more degrees
of freedom are expected to have larger values for x1D
u . We show that externally attached ﬂexible
linkers also contribute to the measured unfolding characteristics.

Atomic force microscopy or optical tweezers are now
routinely used to study the mechanical properties of pro-
teins [1, 2]. An important issues is the unfolding behavior
of folded domains, including the strength, and the depen-
dence on fold topology [3] and secondary structure [3, 4].
The simplest description of unfolding treats the unfolding
domain as moving in a one dimensional potential G(x),
where the reaction coordinate x is assumed to be directly
coupled to the applied force. In perhaps the simplest ap-
proximation, the rate of unfolding ku(F ) of a two-state
(native and denatured) protein under force can then be
calculated using Bell’s formula based on Kramers’ rela-
tion for escape from a well [1, 5]:

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute tem-
perature, x1D
is the transition state displacement along
u
the force projection, and k0
u is the unfolding rate con-
stant at zero force. This result can be used to calculate
the distributions of unfolding times (for applied force)
or unfolding forces (for applied pulling speed), and has
been applied to many diﬀerent proteins [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
This simple result has been corrected to use the entire
shape of G(x) rather than just the barrier height and
displacement x1D
u and incorporate the cantilever compli-
ance [11, 12], to relax the diﬀusive limit to faster speeds
[13], and to allow for multiple pathways or states [14, 15].
There has been extensive work on the utility of a the xu
and the simple 1D picture, linear force dependence, etc
[16, 17] [More work to do here!!!]

However, the assumption of a one dimensional reac-
tion coordinate grossly simpliﬁes physical reality. The
unfolding rate depends dramatically on pulling direction
[18, 19], and hence on the multidimensional nature of the
free energy landscape. Moreover, the one dimensional
parameters have no satisfactory physical interpretation:
x1D
is deﬁned along the pulling direction, while the ac-
u

u ≃

tual unfolding takes place along an unknown reaction co-
ordinate(s), presumably involving a few key amino acids.
While x1D
0.2 nm is the right order of magnitude for
hydrogen bonds, the explicit connection with molecular
conﬁgurations remains unclear. In this Letter we explore
the role of the multidimensional energy landscape in de-
termining the eﬀective 1D unfolding parameters. The key
physical ingredient is that an applied force perturbs ﬂuc-
tuations transverse to the forcing direction, because of
the highly anharmonic nature of angular bonds. Specif-
ically, force restricts a protein’s conformational search
among the dihedral states of the polypeptide backbone.
We calculate this using molecular dynamics (MD) sim-
ulations of a simple oﬀ-lattice G¯o model [20, 21] for a

with diﬀerent degrees of freedom randomly increased or
decreased with an applied force, there would be little
eﬀect. However, we expect the volume of most perturbed
degrees of freedom to decrease under an applied force,
so that δxu is proportional to the number of perturbed
degrees of freedom. For a force-independent volume we
recover Eq. 1, with δxu = 0.

Calculation of phase space volumes— Phase space ﬂuc-
tuation volumes were calculated from MD simulation tra-
jectories. MD was performed for protein L (PDB refer-
ence: 1HZ6 [24]) using the Cα G¯o model of Refs. [20, 25].
The simulation protocol is described in detail in [3]. A
real protein does not ﬂuctuate about a single well-deﬁned
average structure; because dihedral angles typically ac-
cess discrete values, the accessible states are ﬂuctua-
tions about many well deﬁned structures, or nodes in
phase space. Fig. 2 shows the phase space explored by a
tetramer with 2 unimodal and 2 bimodal dihedral distri-
butions.

u (F ) is the weighted sum

number of multi-modal dihedral peaks. The latter ef-
fect dominates, since the loss of a single dihedral peak
immediately removes many nodes of phase space. Sim-
ulations of the unfolding of the same protein L domain

0.004 nm, from measuring an exponential

u /(kB T ), as predicted from a single reaction

coordinate description, Eq. (1). Hence we conclude that
the bare transition state position was xu = 0.137 nm, and
0.008 nm is between 34%
the large shift of δxu = 0.054
and 45%.

Linker Eﬀects— For convenience, protein domains
are often pulled with long linkers, or unfolded protein
strands. The linkers also ﬂuctuate about discrete di-
hedral states when stretched. The “lumpiness” of this
phase space is irrelevant for weakly stretched strands, but
dominates the response for strongly stretched strands.
Since force is coupled to the folded domain through the
linkers, the total available phase space is the product of
protein and linker phase spaces, and the measured x1D
u
depends on the restriction of the linkers’ phase space.

total time of 1 µs at T=300K.

Results— Fig. 3a shows the phase space volume as a
function of force calculated from MD simulations of pro-
tein L. The dynamic contribution to the transition state
placement is δxu = 0.054
0.008 nm. The reduction
±
of phase space volume comes from (1) the narrowing of
the dihedral distributions, and (2) the reduction in the

To test this, homogeneous linkers strands were con-
structed from a dihedral potential based on glycine.
Fig. 4 shows the normalised eﬀective phase space volume
N (F )/V eﬀ
V eﬀ
N (0) and the corresponding δxu as a function
of force for diﬀerent number of atoms nl per linker. The
eﬀect is greater for longer linkers, since more nodes are
available to remove. We have ignored any force depen-

dence of the volume of the transition state VT S (Eq. 4).
Although we cannot easily characterize the (unstable)
transition state, we can compare the shifts δxu measured
directly from the unfolding times (Fig. 3) with predic-
tions from the phase space volumes (Fig. 4). The dif-
ference δxu(nl = 32)
0.05 nm
from the calculation of phase space volumes (at forces of
order 200
300 pN) agrees with the diﬀerence xu(nl =
32)
xu(nl = 16) = 0.026 nm measured from pulling sim-
ulations. This gives us conﬁdence that for this model
of protein L the transition state is sharp and its volume
does not change appreciably under an applied force.

Discussion— We have shown that an externally ap-
plied force restricts a ﬂuctuating protein’s accessible
phase space volume, which increases the transition state
displacement x1D
u in the equivalent one dimensional two-
state model. This contribution can be appreciable be-
cause of the many degrees of freedom in a protein. Larger
proteins have a potentially larger x1D
u , depending on
which degrees of freedom couple to the applied force;
this will depend critically on the topology of the fold and
the direction in which it is pulled. Most importantly,
we predict that x1D
should be greater for proteins un-
u
folded through longer attached linker strands. This may
have biological signiﬁcance; e.g. the long unfolded PEVK
regions in titin [27] may play help modify the unfold-
ing characteristics of titin. Finally, we note that many
experiments have unfolded concatamers of multiple do-
mains, for convenience of attachment and to generate
larger statistics [9, 10, 15, 18, 19, 28, 29, 30, 31]. We sur-
mise that in all of these cases the dynamic contribution
to x1D
u was signiﬁcant, and also included a contribution
from already unfolded domains, which act as “linkers”
for the last few domains to unfold in a given pull.

Abstract

→

The requisites for the persistence of small colonies of self-replicating
molecules living in a two-dimensional lattice are investigated analyt-
ically in the inﬁnite diﬀusion or mean-ﬁeld limit and through Monte
Carlo simulations in the position-ﬁxed or contact process limit. The
molecules are modeled by hypercyclic replicators A which are capable
2A with production rate s as
of replicating via binary ﬁssion A + E
well as via catalytically assisted replication 2A+E
3A with rate c. In
addition, a molecule can degrade into its source materials E with rate
γ. In the asymptotic regime the system can be characterized by the
presence (active phase) and the absence (empty phase) of replicators
in the lattice. In both diﬀusion regimes, we ﬁnd that for small values
of the ratio c/γ these phases are separated by a second-order phase
transition which is in the universality class of the directed percolation,
while for small values of s/γ the phase transition is of ﬁrst order. Fur-
thermore, we show the suitability of the dynamic Monte Carlo method,
which is based on the analysis of the spreading behavior of a few active
cells in the center of an otherwise inﬁnite empty lattice, to address the
problem of the emergence of replicators. Rather surprisingly, we show
that this method allows an unambiguous identiﬁcation of the order of
the nonequilibrium phase transition.

Introduction

The most fundamental event in the history of life was probably the appearance via
spontaneous creation of a molecule capable of replicating itself (replicator). Given
a possible mechanism of replication, which in this case is some form of template
activity, the evolution of such replicators has been extensively investigated through
the chemical kinetics formalism put forward by Eigen and co-workers in the seven-
ties [1, 2]. Those studies have raised a series of objections to the simplistic view
of the emergence of a complex organism from a collection of competing species of
replicators. For instance, the ﬁnding that the length of a molecule (polynucleotide)
is limited due to the ﬁnite replication accuracy per nucleotide has prompted the
proposal of models that incorporated some sort of cooperation between the repli-
cators, such as the molecular catalytic feedback networks termed hypercycles [2].
These models, however, have attracted their own criticisms since, as pointed out
by Maynard Smith, giving catalytic support in such molecular networks is in fact
an altruistic behavior and so they are extremely vulnerable to the presence of par-
asites, i.e., molecules that do not reciprocate the catalytic support they receive [3].
A possible solution to this problem is provided by the structured deme formula-
tion of group selection [4], where it is assumed that the replicators are spatially
localized, say, in rock crevices or water droplets, so that the beneﬁts accrued from
cooperation are directed mostly to the members of the catalytic network [5, 6, 7].
Yet another successful approach to the problem of resistance against parasites is
based on a reaction-diﬀusion system where replication and diﬀusion taking place on
an adsorbing surface generate self-organized spiral structures [8, 9]. Interestingly,
as these spatial structures, which greatly increase the stability of the hypercycles
against parasites, can be viewed as super-organisms that approach is also related
to the group selection theory [8].

Since in the prebiotic or chemical evolution context, natural selection is es-
sentially the dynamics of replicators, it is not surprising that most of the studies
in this subject have focused almost exclusively on the competition between repli-
cators, among which the so-called malthusian and hypercyclic replicators are the
most important [2, 5]. The former corresponds to the simplest reproduction process,
namely, the binary ﬁssion of a parent replicator and is modelled by the chemical
reaction

A + E s
→

2A

where A is the replicator and E is the source materials (mononucleotide resources).
It is well-known that the concentration of A grows exponentially with the rate con-
stant s, provided that the concentration of E is kept constant, hence the name
malthusian replicator. To avoid this explosive growth, one usually imposes a con-
straint on the total concentration of replicators which can be implemented in prac-
tice by a dilution ﬂux [1]. Alternatively, one can allow the replicators to be degraded
by hydrolysis into its mononucleotide components E according to the reaction

(1)

(2)

which seems a more natural approach to limit the growth of A.

As best exempliﬁed by sexual reproduction, there are situations that cannot be
described by (1) since two replicators are necessary to produce a third one. In this
case the corresponding chemical reaction is

2A + E

c
→

(3)

which leads to a hyperbolic growth of the concentration of replicator A [2]. A
hypercyclic replicator is deﬁned as one that can replicate itself using both (1) and (3)
reaction schemes. Actually, the term hypercycle derives from the superimposition
of the catalytic replication cycle (3) on the self-replication cycle (1). Of course, the
limit c = 0 corresponds to the malthusian replicator while s = 0 can be associated
to an obligatory sexual replicator.

In contrast to previous works that have concentrated on the competition be-
tween replicators either of the same kind but with diﬀerent production rates [1, 2] or
of diﬀerent kinds [5], in this paper we address a more fundamental problem that has
received comparatively little attention, namely, the stability of the diﬀerent kinds
of replicators, viewed here as an active (ordered) phase of the molecular system,
against the empty (disordered) phase composed of the resource materials only. This
lack of interest was probably due to the fact that the usual kinetics formalism used
to study the dynamics of replicators does not represent the mononucleotide resource
dynamics explicitly (see however [10, 11]), thus precluding the study of the issues
addressed in the present contribution. More pointedly, we consider the dynamics of
a population of identical hypercyclic replicators on a lattice space both in the de-
terministic inﬁnite diﬀusion (mean-ﬁeld) limit and in the stochastic position-ﬁxed
(contact process) limit where each replicator on a lattice cell never moves. The
last limit is particularly interesting because it allows the connection between the
replicator models and some standard models of nonequilibrium phase transition in
a lattice (e.g. directed percolation) [12, 13, 14]. As a result, the powerful analytical
tools of statistical mechanics can be readily used to advance our understanding
of the evolution of replicators. Of particular relevance is the so-called dynamic
Monte Carlo method whose idea is to set the system initially in the empty state
with a seed of replicators in the center of the lattice and then study the subsequent
spreading of activity [12, 13, 14]. More importantly, the thorough analysis of both
limits exposes the limitations of the widely used deterministic chemical kinetics or
mean-ﬁeld formalism to study the problem of the emergence of life.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we present the
set of rules that govern the evolution of a population of hypercyclic replicators in
a two-dimensional square lattice. The mean-ﬁeld or inﬁnite diﬀusion limit, which
models an ideally mixed medium, is studied analytically in Sec. 3. The results
are summarized in a phase diagram showing the regions of stability of the empty
and active regimes in the space of the control parameters of the model. Those
regions are delimitated by continuous as well as discontinuous transition lines that
join at a tricritical point. In Sec. 4 we study the position-ﬁxed or contact process
limit using mainly the dynamic Monte Carlo method which allows the computation
of the critical dynamic exponents that describe quantitatively the spreading of a
vanishingly small population of replicators. Finally, some concluding remarks are

3

presented in Sec. 5. In particular, we compare the hypercyclic replicator model with
Schl¨ogl’s models of nonequilibrium phase transition in reaction-diﬀusion systems
[15].

2 The model

It has been suggested that chemical evolution started with a surface-bonded au-
tocatalytic chemical network as there are enormous thermodynamics and kinetics
advantages of surface binding reactions, especially in the case of reactions that re-
quire unlikely collisions of many reactants [16]. The binding must be strong enough
to keep the reactants on the surface but also ﬂexible enough to allow their slow mi-
gration on it. Interestingly, if this proposal proves correct it will probably lead to
the replacement of the popular notion of a primitive soup by that of a primitive
pizza instead [17]. Accordingly, we deﬁne our replicator model in a two-dimensional
space consisting of L
L cells in a square toroidal lattice. Each cell is either empty
or occupied by a replicator and it is assumed that an empty cell contains all source
material required to assemble a new replicator. The evolution of the population of
replicators is governed by the following local rules:

×

(1) A replicator has a probability γ of decaying; after decay the cell becomes

empty. This rule is motivated by the hydrolysis reaction (2).

(2) A replicator in one of the four ﬁrst neighbor cells (von Neumann neighbor-
hood) of an empty cell can replicate into that cell with probability s. This
process is referred to as non-catalised self-replication and is motivated by the
reaction (1).

(3) Regardless of the previous rule, a replicator in the von Neumann neighbor-
hood of an empty cell can replicate into that cell if there are other replicators
in the intersection of the Moore neighborhoods of both cells. The probability
of this type of replication, which is motivated by reaction (3), is c for each
pair of replicators. We recall that the Moore neighborhod of a given cell
consists of its ﬁrst and second nearest neighbors, adding up to eight cells.

Hence in the extreme situation where an empty cell is surrounded by eight repli-
cators, it can become occupied with probability 4s + 16c. To carry out the simu-
lations we choose the parameters c and s such that 4s + 16c
1. These rules are
applied simultaneously to all cells in the lattice so our model can be viewed as a
two-dimensional stochastic cellular automaton. Actually the model is essentially an
adaptation to one-membered hypercycles of the spatial cellular automaton model of
multi-membered hypercycles proposed by Boerlijst and Hogeweg [8]. The dynamics
deﬁned by the rules given above is manifestly irreversible and, in particular, the
state characterized by empty cells only is an absorbing state, i.e., a conﬁguration
from which the system cannot escape. In this sense, the principle of detailed bal-
ance is broken and the active stationary state is in fact in nonequilibrium. Although
the more realistic situation is a diﬀusion-controled reaction where each reactant can

≤

4

move randomly on the lattice, in this paper we choose to study in detail the simpler
extreme cases of inﬁnite diﬀusion (mean ﬁeld) and no diﬀusion (contact process).
Of course, we hope that features common to both limits will be present in the ﬁnite
diﬀusion situation as well.

3 The mean-ﬁeld limit

The mean-ﬁeld limit describes exactly an inﬁnite population of reactants in an
ideally mixed medium and so it is equivalent to the usual chemical kinetics formu-
lation. Neglecting spatial correlations among cells, i.e., assuming that at any time
the molecules are distributed randomly over the lattice cells, it is straightforward
to write the evolution equation for the density of replicators or occupied cells at
time t, namely,

ρt+1 = ρt (1

γ) + 4ρt (1
We will consider only the stationary solutions ρt+1 = ρt = ρ of this equation. The
absorbing (empty) state ρ = 0 is always a solution, while the non-zero solutions are
given by the roots of the quadratic equation

This equation has real roots provided that the condition (˜c + ˜s)2
4˜c is satisﬁed.
In addition we can easily show that: (i) for ˜s < 1 and ˜c > ˜s both roots are positive;
(ii) for ˜s < 1 and ˜c < ˜s both roots are negative; and (iii) for ˜s > 1 only one of the
roots is negative. Furthermore, though the solution ρ = 0 exists in the entire plane
(˜c, ˜s), it is stable only if the condition

which reduces to ˜s < 1, is satisﬁed. In the region where the non-zero roots are
physical (i.e., real and positive), the stable root is always the largest one. In Fig.
1 we show the steady-state density of replicators for two diﬀerent choices of initial
density. We identify three distinct phases: the absorbing or empty phase (E)
associated to the solution ρ = 0; the replicating or active phase (A) associated to
the solution ρ > 0; and the phase labeled (EA) where both solutions ρ = 0 and
ρ > 0 are stable. In this phase, the outcome of the dynamics is not determined by
the control parameters only but also by the initial abundance of replicators. ¿From
this ﬁgure it is clear that the system undergoes a continuous non-equilibrium phase
transition from phase (E) to phase (A) at ˜s = ˜sc = 1 and ˜c < 1. Explicitly, near
this transition the density of replicators can be written as

emerge spontaneously (i.e., appear at vanishingly small concentrations). For in-
stance, for ˜s = 0, the minimal initial density of replicators necessary to engender
a prosperous population is ρ = 1/2 at the transition point ˜c = 4, vanishing as
1/˜c for large ˜c. Actually, an initial colony of replicators is certain to grow from
vanishingly small concentrations provided that ˜s > 1. These conclusions, however,
must be taken with caution since in the deterministic limit a vanishingly small con-
centration means an inﬁnite population of replicators, while one would expect the
ﬁrst replicators to show up as a single or a few copies at most. Of course, a proper
understanding of this emergence phenomenon calls for a stochastic approach, which
is the subject of the next section.

4 The position-ﬁxed limit

The primary aim of this section is to determine what features of the rich phase-
diagram obtained in the mean-ﬁeld limit show up also in the opposite limit, where
the replicators are ﬁxed on the lattice cells. This is a rather challenging enter-
prise as, at least in the case of equilibrium phase-transitions, there is no totally
unambiguous way by which one can detect the order of the transition through the
analysis of ﬁnite systems alone [18]. Nevertheless, we tackle this problem using both
a steady-state approach for ﬁnite lattices and the dynamical Monte Carlo method
for lattices of eﬀectively inﬁnite size.

First we measure de density ρ of replicators in the steady state. Our results for
two system sizes (L = 100 and L = 200) are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. For each set of
the control parameters we made runs of 105 generations, neglecting the ﬁrst 2 104
generations and recording ρ at steps of 200 generations. A generation corresponds
to the simultaneous update of all lattice cells. Each data point is the arithmetic
mean of these recorded data. Provided that the population is not extinct, the
results are independent of the choice of the initial conﬁguration. In particular, we
have made runs starting from all cells occupied or from a seed of only four clustered
occupied cells. Furthermore, as in the mean-ﬁeld limit we have veriﬁed that our
results depend only on the ratios s/γ and c/γ so throughout the remaining of this
paper the value of the decay constant is held ﬁxed at γ = 0.05. These results
clearly indicate the existence of a phase transition separating the active (ρ > 0)
and empty (ρ = 0) phases of the model. Assuming that in the neighborhood of
˜sc)β and
the transition points the density of replicators goes to zero as ρ
using the least-square method we can estimate both the critical replication rate ˜sc
and the critical exponent β > 0. These estimates are presented in table 1 and the
quality of the ﬁtting can be appreciated from Fig. 4. The statistical errors are of
order of 10−3 but the systematic errors, which are due mainly to the diﬃculty to
carry out long runs very close to the transition point, are probably much larger.
We note that our estimates of β for small values of ˜c indicate that in this regime the
replicator model belongs to the so-called (2 + 1) directed-percolation universality
class for which β = 0.59
0.02 [19]. It should be pointed out that in ﬁnite systems
the active regime is a meta-stable one as there is always a ﬁnite probability that

the colony becomes extinct due to ﬂuctuations in the stochastic dynamics. Since
this extinction probability increases towards 1 as the critical point is approached,
it is very diﬃcult to obtain reliable estimates of ˜sc and β by means of numerical
simulations in the steady-state regime. Of course we are aware that if the transition
happens to become discontinuous at some value of ˜c > 0 then the assumption of a
power-law singularity at the transition point breaks down (actually β = 0 in this
case). In fact, the (anomalous) continuous decrease of β as ˜c increases (see table
1) is an indication that this might be the case. Our careless use of the power-law
assumption is intentional and aims to illustrate the diﬃculty of detecting the order
of a phase transition using results of steady-state simulations: the abrupt variation
of ρ at criticality observed in Fig. 3 for certain values of ˜c, which might indicate the
occurrence of a ﬁrst-order irreversible transition, can be explained as a continuous
transition with a small exponent β as well.

We turn now to the analysis of the spreading behavior of a small colony of
replicators settled initially in the center of an otherwise empty lattice of inﬁnite
size. More pointedly, the initial colony is composed of four replicators located in the

because the lattice size is taken large enough so that during the time we follow the
evolution of the colony the replicators can never reach the lattice boundaries. This
of course sets an upper limit to the number of generations we can follow the colony
and so, in particular, we let the population evolve up to typically t = 104. As usual,
we concentrate on the time dependence of the following key quantities [12]: (i) the
average number of replicators n(t); (ii) the survival probability of the colony P (t);
and (iii) the average mean-square distance over which the replicators have spread
R2(t). For each time t we carry out M = 2 105 independent runs, all starting with
the same initial colony. Hence P (t) is simply the fraction of runs for which there is
at least one replicator in the lattice at time t. Since n(t) is an average taken over all
runs including those which have already been extinct at generation t, the average
number of replicators per surviving run is given by the ratio N (t) = n(t)/P (t).
Furthermore, noting that R2(t) is averaged only over the surviving runs, we can
deﬁne the fractal dimension df of the surviving colonies of replicators at a given
time t as N

Rdf .

In Figs. 5 and 6 we present log-log plots of n(t) and P (t), respectively, as
functions of t in the vicinity of the critical point for ˜c = 0. The dependence of
R2(t) on t is not shown since, near criticality, the curves for diﬀerent values of ˜s
are clustered together and do not reveal any qualitatively relevant information on
the colony evolution. The asymptotic straight lines observed in these ﬁgures are
the signature of critical behavior while upward and downward deviations indicate
supercritical and subcritical behaviors, respectively. A precise estimate for the
critical exponents is obtained by considering the local slopes of the curves shown
in the previous ﬁgures. For instance, the local slope δ(t) is deﬁned by [14, 20]

Using this procedure we ﬁnd ˜sc = 1.628

0.23
by determining two values of ˜s as close as possible to the critical point for which
upward and downward deviations can be observed, while the errors in the critical
exponents are, as usual, the statistical errors obtained by ﬁtting the local slopes
by straigh lines in the large t regime. Our exponents are in good agreement with
those of the (2 + 1) directed-percolation [14] and satisfy very well the hyperscaling
relation (16) thus indicating that the transition in the limit ˜c = 0 is continuous, as
expected.

The results of the spreading analysis for the other extreme case, ˜s = 0, which
models a population of obligatory sexual replicators are shown in Figs. 7 and 8.
Although the dependence of ln P (t) on t is similar to that observed in the previ-
in the
ous case, the behavior pattern of ln n(t) (see Fig. 7) is rather diﬀerent:

supercritical regime (i.e., ˜c > ˜cc) n(t) ﬁrst increases reaching a maximum, then
decreases reaching a minimum and ﬁnally starts to increase monotonically again.
This pattern is illustrated better in Fig. 9, which shows the spreading results for
˜s = 0.2. Analysis of these ﬁgures, which exceptionally show the colony evolution
up to 2 104 generations, suggests that a ﬂat line separates the supercritical and
the subcritical regimes implying thus the vanishing of the exponent η at the tran-
sition point. Furthermore, the qualitatively distinct behavior patterns of ln n(t)
illustrated in Figs. 5, 7 and 9 can be used to identify unambiguously the order
of the nonequilibrium phase transition and hence to estimate the location of the
tricritical point. To appreciate how the time dependence of ln n(t) in the supercrit-
ical regime changes continuously from the simple monotonic increase for ˜s = 0 to
the complicated behavior described above for ˜c = 0 we present in Figs. 10 and 11
log-log plots of n(t) as a function of t for ˜s = 0.6 and ˜s = 1.0, respectively. In fact,
analysis of Figs. 7 to 11 suggests that the turning point between those distinct be-
havior patterns occurs when the maximum and the minimum of n(t) coincide, i.e.,
the critical curve ln n(t) vs. ln t has an inﬂection point (see Fig. 10). The value of
˜s and the corresponding ˜cc at which this behavior occurs are then identiﬁed as the
coordinates of the tricritical point. Applying this procedure we ﬁnd ˜st = 0.60
0.04
and ˜ct = 4.00

The transition points and the dynamic exponents obtained via the scaling laws
(12)-(14) and via the analysis of the local slopes are summarized in table 2. The
errors in the estimates of the transition points are calculated as described before
for the case ˜c = 0. Except for that case, we refrain from presenting the (statistical)
errors in the exponents since the systematic errors are unusually large, due probably
to the crossover behavior among (at least) three diﬀerent universality classes. For
instance, in the vicinity of the transition point for ˜s = 0.6, analysis of the local slope

The evidences in support of our claim that, similarly to the mean-ﬁeld limit,
in the position-ﬁxed limit the nonequilibrium phase transition between the empty
and active phases is discontinuous for small ˜s and so there is a tricritical point in
the phase diagram of the model are threefold: First, the vanishing of the exponent
η in this range signalizes a distinct asymptotic behavior of the average number of
replicators n(t). Second, the hyperscaling relation (16) is clearly violated for small

Finally, in Fig. 14 we present the phase diagram for the position-ﬁxed limit.
In this case there are only two phases, namely, the empty phase (E) characterized
limt→∞ P (t) = 0 and the phase (EA)
by a vanishing probability of survival P∞
where the active and empty states can occur with probabilities P∞ and 1
P∞
(see Figs. 6 and 8), respectively. We note that the population size is eﬀectively
unlimited so that extinction is not certain to occur as in the steady-state analysis
of ﬁnite systems. It is worth emphasizing that for ﬁnite production rates one has
P∞ < 1 and so there is always a nonvanishing probability of extinction. (Actually,

P∞ depends on the number and location of the replicators in the initial colony,
but the conditions we have chosen are the most relevant for the emergence of life
problem.) This result contrasts to our ﬁndings in the mean-ﬁeld limit that the
ﬁxed point associated to the empty phase becomes unstable for ˜s > 1 so that
even starting with a vanishingly small concentration of replicators the population
never dies out. As mentioned before, the reason for this discrepancy is not the
diﬀerence in mobility of the replicators but the fact that the mean-ﬁeld analysis
actually considers an inﬁnite population and hence it fails to take into account the
stochastic ﬂuctuations that could drive a small population to extinction.

For sake of completeness, we should mention that we have also carried out
a similar analysis for one-dimensional lattices (chains). While the results for the
mean-ﬁeld limit are of course the same (provided we properly redeﬁne the dimen-
sionless parameters ˜c and ˜s), the ﬁxed-point limit has some distinct features that

active phases are separated by a second-order phase transition that belongs to the
(1 + 1) directed-percolation universality class [12]. Interestingly, in one-dimension

pronounced ﬁnite-size eﬀects, which are probably due to the proximity to the lower
critical dimension of the model.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have focussed on the prior step in the evolution of life: What are
the necessary conditions for small colonies of molecules capable of making copies
of themselves via some template mechanism to persist? This step must be passed
before one can consider issues such as the outcome of the competition between the
replicators and their defective copies [1, 23] or between diﬀerent kinds of replicators
[2, 5]. As a model of replicator we have considered the well-established hypercyclic
replicator (one-membered hypercycle) which incorporates two independent mech-
anisms of replication, namely, the direct template replication reaction (1) and the
catalytically-assisted template replication reaction (3), whose rates are proportional
to the parameters s and c, respectively. Furthermore, motivated by the modern the-
ories for the evolution of life that suggest a scenario of diﬀusion-controlled chemical
reactions taking place on adsorbing surfaces (probably pyrite) where each reactant
can move randomly on the surface [16, 17], we have considered a two-dimensional
lattice model where each reactant can occupy one of the lattice cells.

Since the diﬀusion process of reactants complicates considerably the analysis,
we have focussed on the two extreme situations: the inﬁnite diﬀusion or mean-
ﬁeld limit and the position-ﬁxed or contact process limit. The expectation is that
features common to both limits should also be present in the more realistic, inter-
mediate situations. In both cases we found rich phase diagrams showing the regions
in the plane (c, s) where the replicators persist (active phase) and die out (empty
phase): these regions are separated by second-order nonequilibrium phase transi-
tions which turn into ﬁrst-order ones at tricritical points. The dynamic Monte Carlo
method has proven very well suited to our investigation of the position-ﬁxed limit
not only because the method is based on the analysis of the spreading behavior of
a small colony of active cells, which is exactly the problem we are interested in, but
because, rather surprisingly, it allows an unambiguous identiﬁcation of the order
of the nonequilibrium phase transition. In addition, we show that the continuous
transition is in the universality class of the (2 + 1) directed percolation.

Some remarks on the apparent similarity between Schl¨ogl’s ﬁrst and second
models and the replicator models studied in this paper are in order [15]. In fact,
irreversible versions of Schl¨ogl’s ﬁrst and second models are recovered when the
reactant E is eliminated from reactions (1) and (3), respectively, so that the exis-
tence of an empty cell containing source materials is not required for replication.
Interestingly, this diﬀerence is not important in the case of malthusian replicators
(c = 0) since this model has the same critical behavior as Schl¨ogl’s ﬁrst model,
namely, a second-order phase transition which is in the same universality class of
the (d + 1) directed percolation (the mean-ﬁeld limit is obtained for d
4) [21].
The comparison between Schl¨ogl’s second model and obligatory sexual replicators

≥

23

(s = 0) is more involved. On the one hand, the mean-ﬁeld analysis of Schl¨ogl’s sec-
ond model predicts a ﬁrst-order phase transition [15] but Monte Carlo calculations
indicate that the transition for d < 4 is a second-order one which is actually in the
same universality class as the transition in Schl¨ogl’s ﬁrst model [22]. On the other
hand, our results for the case s = 0 show that a directed-percolation-like, second-
order phase transition takes place for d = 1 only, the transition being discontinuous
for higher dimensions (d
2). We should mention, however, that the Monte Carlo
implementation of Schl¨ogl’s second model actually allows the diﬀusion of reactants
to neighboring cells and, in addition, allows a cell to shelter more than one reactant
[22] so that a comparison with the position-ﬁxed limit may not be appropriate.
In any event, it is our opinion that the hypercyclic replicator model should not be
viewed as a mere variant of Schl¨ogl’s models; rather it is a well-established model of
chemical evolution [1, 2, 5] which, as far as we know, has not been studied beyond
the mean-ﬁeld limit.

≥

Although the simple replicator model considered in this paper turned out to
be a quite exciting model of nonequilibrium phase transitions, we should not lose
sight of the original purpose of this work and so, at this stage, it is important to
highlight the relevance of our results to the origin of life issue. In fact, the mere
existence of a phase transition between the empty and the active regimes poses a
diﬃculty to our scenario of the emergence of life since the scaled production rate
˜s of the spontaneously created self-replicating molecule must be larger than some
threshold value already at the outset. Though increasing the mobility of the reac-
tants decreases this threshold somewhat, that scenario would be more plausible if
replicators with vanishingly small production rates could also thrive. The situation
becomes even worse in the case of ﬁrst-order transitions: in the deterministic mean-
ﬁeld limit the initial abundance of the spontaneously created replicators should be
large as well, while in the stochastic position-ﬁxed limit the probability of survival
in the vicinity of the transition point is some orders of magnitude smaller than in
the case of a second-order transition (see Figs. 6 and 8). Furthermore, our results
indicate that some important conclusions, such as the certainty of survival for ˜s > 1
or the role played by the initial concentration of replicators near a discontinuous
transition, are actually artifacts of the deterministic formalism commonly used to
study chemical evolution.

In summary, our results show the necessity of adding some new elements to
the standard scenario for the emergence of life whose eﬀect would be to avoid the
phase-transitions, allowing thus ineﬃcient replicators to thrive at this ﬁrst stage
of life. Only then one can invoke natural selection and imperfect replication to
boost the replication rates. In addition, our results point to the inadequacy of the
deterministic mean-ﬁeld or chemical kinetics formulation to address the origin of
life issue and suggest as an alternative stochastic formulation the dynamic Monte
Carlo method that has been extensively used in the physics literature to study
nonequilibrium phase transitions.

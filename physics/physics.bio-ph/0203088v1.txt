Traveling waves are analyzed in a model of the Hantavirus infection of deer mice. The existence
of two kinds of wave phenomena is predicted. An environmental parameter governs a transition
between two regimes of propagation. In one of them the front of infection lags behind at a constant
rate. In the other, fronts of susceptible and infected mice travel at the same speed, separated by
a constant delay. The dependence of the delay on system parameters is analyzed numerically and
through a piecewise linearization.

INTRODUCTION

The Hantavirus zoonosis is a persistent problem in
many regions of the world [1]. Each species of Han-
tavirus is almost exclusively associated with a single ro-
dent species from which, eventually, humans may result
infected. The disease can range from mild to very se-
vere, with a mortality in excess of 50%. Such is the case
of the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) produced
by the virus associated with the deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatus). In the North American Southwest, indeed,
a serious outbreak of this disease in 1993 led to the iden-
tiﬁcation of the virus and its association with the deer
mouse [2]. Since then, enormous eﬀort and resources have
been devoted to the understanding of the ecology and the
epidemiology of the virus-mouse association, with the ul-
timate goal of being able to predict and prevent the risk
for the human population [3, 4].
As observed by Yates et al.

[5], the role of the envi-
ronment seems to be determinant in the prevalence of
the infection within the mouse population, and the re-
lated incidence of the HPS. Its has been observed that
the disease can disappear completely from a local popu-
lation during times of adverse environmental conditions,
only to reappear sporadically [3, 6]. Besides, there are
indications of focality of the infection in “refugia” of the
mouse population. Both phenomena are most probably
related, the refugia acting as reservoirs of the virus during
times when the infection has disappeared from most of
the landscape. When environmental conditions change,
the infection spreads again from these refugia.

In a recent work [7], Abramson and Kenkre have shown
that a simple epidemic model is able to display qualita-

tively these behaviors, as the result of a bifurcation of
the equilibrium states of the system as controlled by the
carrying capacity of the medium. The purpose of the
present paper is to analyze the dynamics of simple trav-
eling waves, as a model of the mechanisms in which an
epidemic wave of Hantavirus might propagate into a pre-
viously uninfected region.

II. SPATIALLY EXTENDED MODEL

The model of Ref. [7] is a mean-ﬁeld continuous model
which has been intentionally kept simple enough to facil-
itate the comprehension of the basic mechanisms, and at
the same time to incorporate as many known facts about
the ecology and epidemiology of the biological system
as possible. The reader is referred to [7] for a detailed
discussion, which we summarize here. It is known that
the virus does not aﬀect properties such as the mortality
of the mice, so that no appreciable diﬀerence in death
rate, for example, is to be expected between susceptible
It is also not transmitted to new-
and infected mice.
borns, so that all mice are born susceptible. The infection
is transmitted from mouse to mouse through individual
contacts, presumably during ﬁghts. More general facts
of the ecology of Peromyscus indicate that adults occa-
sionally shift their home range to nearby locations, in
particular if these are vacant [8, 9]. This enables us to
model the transport of mice as a diﬀusion process. Fi-
nally, intra-species competition for resources indicate a
saturated population growth, which has been observed
to be of a logistic form in the laboratory [10]. Logistic
growth is also a well established metaphor of the dynam-
ics of a self-limitating population [11].

For the sake of simplicity, assume further that the only
population structure is the division of the whole popula-
tion into susceptible and infected mice, denoted by MS
and MI respectively. With these ingredients, the model

is described by the following equations:

Observe that the carrying capacity K(x, t), containing
the most direct eﬀect of the environment on the mouse
population, is allowed, in our model, a spatial and a tem-
poral variation, to accommodate for a diversity of habi-
tats and temporal phenomena. The latter comprise the
yearly variation due to seasonality, but also sporadic ﬂuc-
tuations such as droughts and El Ni˜no eﬀects.

The sum of the two equations (1)-(2) reduces to a single

equation for the whole population:

This is Fisher’s equation, originally proposed as a de-
terministic model of the spread of a favored gene in a
population [12], and which eventually became a standard
model for a self regulated ﬁeld in a diversity of situations
[11, 13].

In Ref. [7] it was shown that, as a function of K, the
system undergoes a bifurcation between a stable state
with only susceptible mice (and MI = 0) to a stable
state with both positive populations. The value of the
critical carrying capacity is a function of the parameters
in the following way:

Kc =

a(b

b

−

.

c)

(4)

This critical value does not depend on D, and the same
bifurcation is observed either in a space-independent sys-
tem (D = 0) or in a homogeneous extended one in the
presence of diﬀusion. In an inhomogeneous situation, for
moderate values of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, the infected
subpopulation remains restricted to those places where
K > Kc, becoming extinct in the rest. During times of
adverse environmental conditions, these regions become
isolated and constitute the observed refugia. Figure 1
shows a typical situation of this phenomenon. A simu-
lated, albeit realistic, landscape of K(x) has been derived
from satellite images in Northern Patagonia. The carry-
ing capacity is supposed proportional to the vegetation
cover, and results highest along a river, clearly inferred
from the density plots. These show the distribution of
the populations of susceptible and infected mice. It can
be seen that susceptible mice cover most of the range.
Meanwhile, the infected population has become extinct
in most of it, and persists only in some of the places of
highest K. The distributions shown in Fig. 1 constitute a
stable equilibrium of the system, found by numerical res-
olution of Eqs. (1)-(2) from an arbitrary initial condition,
and with zero-current boundary conditions.

III. TRAVELING WAVES

When conditions in the landscape change, how do the
infected phase evolve from the refugia, retracting from
or, more importantly, invading previously uninfected re-
gions? this is the primary question we address in the
present paper. Fisher’s equation (3) has found wide ap-
plicability for the description of the formation and prop-
agation of spatio-temporal patterns. Traveling wave so-
lutions of Fisher’s equation paradigmatically show how
a stable phase invades an unstable one in the form of a
front propagating at a certain speed.

There is no reason to suppose a priori that the two
waves, susceptible and infective, will travel at the same
speed. Accordingly, we use an ansatz which incorporates
two independent traveling waves. In one dimension, z1 =
x
vI t in Eq. (2). This gives
the following second-order system of ordinary diﬀerential
equations:

+ g(MS, MI ) = 0,

(6)

where vS and vI are the speeds of the susceptible and
infected waves respectively, and f and g are the non-
diﬀusive term in (1)-(2).

There are two interesting scenarios for these waves. In
the ﬁrst one, a large part of the system is initially at
a state of low carrying capacity, below Kc, and conse-
quently the population consists of uninfected mice only,
at the stable equilibrium. Let us suppose that this region
is in contact with a refugium. If environmental changes
occur, and the whole region ﬁnds itself at a value of the
carrying capacity K > Kc, the population will be out
of equilibrium. Two processes will occur simultaneously:
the population of susceptible mice will evolve towards a
new equilibrium, and a wave of infected mice will advance
from the refugium, invading the susceptible population.
The speed of this wave can be calculated from the sta-
bility analysis of the equilibrium states, requiring that
the unstable infected mice density does not oscillate be-
low zero. This unstable equilibrium is M ∗
c),
M ∗
I = 0, and a linear stability analysis of the system
(5)-(6) provides the following four eigenvalues:

The requirement that MI(z) does not oscillate below 0
imposes a restriction to the radical in Eq. (8), from which
we ﬁnd the following expression for the speed of the trav-
eling wave:

An example of such a wave is shown in Fig. 2a, found by a
numerical integration of Eqs. (1) and (2) in 1 dimension.
The second interesting scenario corresponds to a sys-
tem which is initially empty of mice, both susceptible and
infected. This situation is always unstable within the va-
lidity of our simple model, but it is certainly a biological
possibility. Consider a system with K > Kc, and with
MS = MI = 0 in almost all of its range, but in contact
with a refugium in equilibrium. A wave of both mice
populations will develop invading the empty region. In
fact, the total population will display just the behavior
of a traveling wave of Fisher’s equation. This wave will
be composed of two fronts, susceptible and infected re-
spectively, with a delay of the latter with respect to the
former. As before, we can ﬁnd the speeds of these two
waves from a stability analysis around the correspond-
ing equilibria. The leading wave propagates into the null
equilibrium, M ∗
I = 0, to which the following eigen-
values correspond:

K = 30. Both waves move at the same speed v = √2 for this
choice of parameters.

In this situations, we require that MS(z) does not oscil-
late below 0, and Eq. (11) provides the restriction on the
speed of the susceptible front:

vS ≥

(12)

which is, naturally, the same result as for Fisher’s equa-
tion. The second front, developed when part of the quasi-
stable population of susceptible mice is converted into
infected, evolves from the equilibrium M ∗
c),
M ∗
I = 0, as in the previous scenario. Consequently, the
same linear stability analysis apply, and from Eq. (8) we
ﬁnd a speed analogous to Eq. (9). The front of infected
move behind the susceptible one at a speed:

S = K(b

−

vI ≥

D[

−

which, unlike vS, does depend on the contagion rate a
and the carrying capacity K. Figure 2b shows such a
situation. The density of susceptible mice rises from zero
and lingers near the positive unstable equilibrium before
tending to the stable one. It is remarkable that a delay
exists between the two fronts, even when no such eﬀect
was explicitly considered in the dynamics (such as incu-
bation time, or age dependence). Such delays have been
observed in some populations and rationalized in diﬀer-
ent ways (see [14] or [3] for a synthesis).

Even though Eqs. (9), (12) and (13) give only a lower
bound to the speed of propagation of the fronts, and
allow a continuous of speeds above this, in real situations
only the lower bound is expected to be observed as a
stationary solution. Higher speeds may, however, play
a role in transient situations whose relevance in far from
equilibrium systems such as real mice in the wild, subject
to a ﬂuctuating environment, cannot be underestimated.

the delay becomes eﬀectively constant. For values of
K greater than K0, the velocities vI and vS, calculated
from linear considerations around the equilibria, satisfy
vI > vS. This regime is clearly unphysical in a station-
ary situation, since the front of susceptible necessarily
precedes the infected one. It could be realizable and rel-
evant in transient situations, that will be analyzed else-
where. From numerical resolution of the system, we can

ﬁnd an approximate analytical expression for the front
shapes shown in Fig. 2b and, consequently, for the delay
∆ in the stationary state. The details of the calculation
can be found in the Appendix. The main result is the

crepancy in the exponent found numerically in the fully
nonlinear system and the one found in the linearized ap-
proximation, which shows the limitation of the linearized
solution.

This critical behavior of the delay persists while the
wavefronts are of the kind shown in Fig. 2b. However, if
K continues to grow the equilibrium value of the infected
population turns greater than the equilibrium value of
the susceptible. There is a gradual crossover to a sit-
uation where most of the population becomes infected.

of K are probably unrealistic in the arid and semi-arid
habitats of the Southwest. It is nevertheless interesting
to point out that the interaction of the two fronts in this

IV. CONCLUSION

We have analyzed the propagation of traveling fronts
in 1 dimension in a simple model of the ecology and epi-
demiology of the Hantavirus in deer mouse. We have
found that, when a mouse-free region is in contact with
an infected region in equilibrium, two waves propagate
into the empty region. The ﬁrst one is a wave of sus-
ceptible mice. A wave of infected mice propagates be-
hind it with a certain delay. Two regimes of propagation
exist, controlled by the environmental parameter K. If
Kc < K < K0, the lag between the two fronts increase
linearly in time. Conversely, if K > K0, the two fronts
propagate at the same speed and the delay depends crit-
ically on the diﬀerence K

K0.
The occurrence of this double regime may be of rele-
vance for the control of the propagation of an epidemic
wave. Indeed, the controlled reduction of K ahead of a
propagating wave seems the most eﬀective mean of stop-
ping or reducing its advance. Ideally, the carrying capac-
ity should be reduced below K0, to ensure the complete
extinction of the infection. However, if such a reduction
is not feasible, the fact that K0 > Kc provides an al-
ternative: a reduction of the carrying capacity below K0
would make the wave of infection start to lag more and
more behind the wave of healthy mice. Possible imple-
mentations of these strategies, based on the propagation
of waves in the presence of “barriers,” will be analyzed
in detail elsewhere.

−

The existence of dynamical phenomena such as these
traveling fronts also opens the interesting possibility of
subjecting our predictions to experimental veriﬁcation.
Controlled experiments of front propagation could be
possible in the Sevilleta LTER facility, that the Univer-
sity of New Mexico operates near Socorro, NM [15]. Mea-
surements of uncontrolled mice populations along lines
radiating from the refugia of infection will also provide
evidence of the propagation mechanisms. The observa-
tion of these in real mice population will provide a valu-
able source of data to assign realistic values to the pa-
rameters of the mathematical model.

V. APPENDIX: LINEARIZED SOLUTIONS

For the purpose of ﬁnding approximate solutions of the
waves proﬁles, it is better to replace the system (5)-(6)
with one involving M and MI instead:

DM ′′ + vM ′ + (b

M (z)/K and both speeds
where q(M (z)) =
are assumed equal, as observed in numerical resolutions
for the regime K > K0. Primes denote diﬀerentiation
with respect to z. The reason for using this system is
that the equation for M (z), Eq. (20), being closed, can
be solved independently of MI . Its solution can be used
then into Eq. (21) as a z-dependent parameter and solve
for MI(z).

Linearized solutions for the traveling waves of Fisher’s
equation (20) are well known, and essentially consist
of two exponentials, matched smoothly at z = 0, rep-
resenting a front that travels to the right at a speed
v
c). Such a function needs a further sim-
pliﬁcation in order to solve Eq. (21). We approximate
M (z) with a step function discontinuous at z = 0:
M (z) = M ∗ = K(b

where φ1 and φ2 are respectively the arguments of the

the phase diﬀerence between both tend to π. Conse-

Expressions (25)-(27), (28)-(30) and (36)-(40) deﬁne
the linearized solution for MI . An example of such a
front wave is shown in Fig. 5.

This result from the piecewise linearization does not
agree with that found numerically in the nonlinear sys-
tem.

The Cochlear Tuning Curve

Abstract

The tuning curve of the cochlea measures how large an input is required to
elicit a given output level as a function of the frequency. It is a fundamental ob-
ject of auditory theory, for it summarizes how to infer what a sound was on the
basis of the cochlear output. A simple model is presented showing that only two
elements are sufﬁcient for establishing the cochlear tuning curve: a broadly tuned
traveling wave, moving unidirectionally from high to low frequencies, and a set of
mechanosensors poised at the threshold of an oscillatory (Hopf) instability. These
two components sufﬁce to generate the various frequency-response regimes which
are needed for a cochlear tuning curve with a high slope.

Our senses are understood to very different degrees. For example, a fair amount is
known and understood about visual transduction: the eye is like a camera, with a lens
that focuses light onto the sensitive ﬁlm of the retina. The lens is solely responsible for
the sharpness of imaging, while the rod cells of the retina are solely responsible for the
high sensitivity of the eye; both have attained fundamental physical limits, diffraction-
limited focusing and single-photon sensitivity. Furthermore we know the molecular
players involved in phototransduction and quite a bit about how these players play
together to generate a neural response to a single photon. By contrast, we know many
facts about the ear, but we do not yet fully understand how to put them together into a
coherent picture. We do know that the ear is nothing like a microphone; if anything,
we could say that the ear is like a camera, with a “lens” that sharply focuses sound
(according to frequency) onto a sound-sensitive ﬁlm. We know that the sharpness
and sensitivity of this process have achieved fundamental physical limitations. But
the intriguing twist of the plot is that, in the cochlea, the lens and the ﬁlm are one
and the same: the hair cells are both the active sound-sensing elements, as well as
the source of the active mechanical feedback of sound that results in the cochlea’s
frequency selectivity.
If the active mechanisms in the hair cells are turned off, the
cochlea can neither sharply “focus” sound nor amplify faint sounds. This dual role
of the hair cells as both lens and ﬁlm has made it difﬁcult to unravel various pieces
of the puzzle. Furthermore, the picture is similarly difﬁcult at the molecular level:
the transduction channels which are ultimately responsible for generating an electrical

1

impulse in response to sound have long eluded identiﬁcation. First because they are
so few, about tens per hair cell, as opposed to > 109 rhodopsin molecules per rod
cell. Secondly because the high-frequency nature of the detection has thrust upon these
channels dual roles which preclude their direct interaction with other molecular players
which might help in identifying them. Five different molecules mediate the information
cascade between photon detection and the closing of ion channels that generates an
electrical impulse; there is no evidence yet of any intermediates in hair cells, where the
(still hypothetical) tip link-gating channel complex seems to have simultaneous roles
in sound detection, electrical impulse generation and mechanical feedback.

The dual roles of the cochlea in ampliﬁcation and frequency tuning appear to be
two aspects of the same phenomenon. In 1948, T. Gold hypothesized [1] that in or-
der for the cochlea to provide tuning in view of high viscous damping, it would have
to follow a mechanism similar to regenerative receivers, where positive feedback can
generate at the same time high ampliﬁcation and sharp frequency selectivity. This re-
generative hypothesis lay dormant for many years, due to what appeared as evidence
against it. It slowly resurfaced because one of its fundamental implications, that mis-
adjusted feedback would result in sound emission, is to date the only explanation we
have for spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, the universally ocurring phenomenon of
sound being emitted by the cochlea. A second line of microscopic experimental ev-
idence for Gold’s hypothesis has been slowly surfacing recently. It was noted in [2],
based on modeling of the transduction channel, that hair bundles appear to be operating
near a Hopf bifurcation, the oscillatory instability behind regeneration, and experimen-
tal conﬁrmation soon followed [3, 8]. Finally, purely theoretical considerations pro-
vide backing circumstancial evidence: the Hopf bifurcation posesses intrinsic essential
nonlinear characteristics which agree with otherwise unexplainable nonlinear charac-
teristics of the ear [4, 6]. It had already been noted by Gold that a feedback loop to
keep the system tuned to the threshold of instability would be required, in the manner
of superregenerative receivers; a plausible molecular implementation of self-tuning has
been shown in [5]; though the exact players are debatable, the mechanism is generic.

The problem is that the Hopf instability alone does not seem to explain, by itself, the
mechanical and neural tuning curves of the cochlea. A fundamental property of sensory
systems is that they are “built” to be “used” by the brain; i.e., the most illuminating
characterization of such systems is not the “forward” transfer responses which tell us
how the system reacts to stimuli, but the “reverse” characteristics, in which we try to
know what stimulus caused a given reaction. This is the viewpoint of the brain, which
tries to infer what is out there in the world based on the information coming out of the
sensory systems; an extremely clear example in the H1 neuron of the ﬂy is given in [12],
as well as the theoretical infrastructure to relate these ideas to Bayesian approaches and
info theory. In the case of hearing, this viewpoint was taken very early on; because of
the inaccesibility of the cochlea, ﬁrst characterizations were of the neural output present
in the auditory nerve rather than mechanical responses, and took the following form.
A single frequency is presented, and its intensity is varied until the output reaches a
speciﬁed level—be it spikes per second in the case of the nerve, or a given amplitude
of vibration in the basilar membrane. As the frequency is sweeped, one reconstructs
a curve telling how much input is necessary to elicit a given response as a function
of the frequency, which is called the tuning curve [9]; in the case of auditory nerve

2

measurements, this is called the neural tuning curve. The shape of these curve is close
to universal: the tuning curve has one minimum, one speciﬁc frequency for which the
intensity required to elicit a given response is minimal, the central frequency (CF) of
the nerve ﬁber or spot on the cochlea being observed. Around that minimum there
is marked and universal asymetry: a very shallow left ﬂank, and an extremely steep
right ﬂank, and then saturation. The slope of the right ﬂank is a fundamental measure
of auditory acuitiy, reaching the 120 dB per octave in mammals, and a non-negligible
90-100 db/oct in lower vertebrates such as Gekko gekko. Contrarily, sufﬁciently close
to a Hopf bifurcation systems respond in a universal way [4, 5], which is symmetric
around the resonant frequency, at least locally. In [4] a closed form solution shows the
“tuning curve” of a single Hopf bifurcation to be locally symmetric; this is computed
to be F 2 = R6 + ∆ω2R2 which is (a) symetric, and (b) shallowly increasing near the
critical frequency. Thus Gold’s hypothesis by itself does not fully generate a theory of
cochlear function.

I shall now suply the missing ingredient, the traveling wave (TW). In order to under-
stand tuning curves, one should study the forward quantitative measurements carefully.
Careful examination of cochlear velocimetry data, for instance from [10, 11], show the
following. The response curves to the left of the resonance look quite similar to a

3

Hopf response. However, the Hopf bifurcation is nonlinearly compressive only in the
vicinity of the resonance frequency, while the cochlear velocimetry data is nonlinearly
compressive at the resonant frequency and all higher frequencies. The amplitudes at
higher frequencies fall extremely fast, but the responses are still bunched together at
close to 1
3 dB per dB. Since the tuning curve is obtained by intersecting the response
curves horizontally and checking which amplitude intersects the horizontal line at a
given frequency, we get immediate insight: the steepness of the right ﬂank is not gen-
erated as a result of high order poles or any such ﬁltering: it is the result of the non-
linear compression acting only on frequencies greater than or equal to the CF. This
suggests that as sound travels the cochlea, entering at the base, where high frequencies
are mapped, it propagates until reaching the location for its frequency, where it is non-
linearly ampliﬁed. As it continues into the cochlea its amplitude diminishes rapidly, but
it has already been nonlinearly saturated. The unidirectionality of the traveling wave,
together with the fact we have an array of Hopf oscillators rather than only one, give us
a strong asymmetry between lower and higher frequencies; the fact that the traveling
wave propagates from high to low frequencies then dictates that nonlinear saturation
occurs in Fig 2 on the right of the resonance.

Figure 3: Scheme of the model. (a) The mechanical equivalent circuit.
Rectangles are passive, linear, weakly tuned elements, while the triangles
represent active elements poised at the Hopf bifurcation. Sound enters
through the top left of the diagram, where high frequencies are mapped,
proceeds through the top track of linear elements, ﬁlters down through
the active elements, and is collected through the bottom track of linear
elements. The entire structure may be parametrized by local resonant fre-
quency; highest frequency is ωe at the entry point, and diminishes expo-
nentially as the wave travels. (b) The response at any given point in the
basilar membrane ωf is a sum over all paths of the form shown, which are
parametrized by ω0, and where ω0 > ωf : sound moves unidirectionally
through this structure and is not allowed to return back.

Are these two elements, Hopf plus traveling wave, enough to explain the tuning curve?
Let us build a simple model of the mechanics of the cochlea. Let’s say that the passive

mechanical part of the cochlea is set up as a series of very weakly tuned low pass
ﬁlters, organized in a unidirectional series. Let us use a Q = 1 Lorentzian response
for simplicity. Let us say that there are an array of Hopf oscillators, whose central
frequencies track the central frequencies of the passive part of the system, all arranged
in parallel, and then collected together by a mechanical system identical to the ﬁrst.
(This arrangement has been selected for analytical tractability; other more complex
topologies show similar results). The response is a sum over all paths through this
graph; since the top and lower portion of the paths are linear they can be explicitly
summed.

In what follows, I shall use speciﬁc functions chosen to (a) be reasonable and (b)
be analytically tractable. The qualitative features of the model do not depend in the
least upon this choice. Linear ﬁltering shall be achieved through a local gain function
where ω is the input frequency and ω0 the local resonant frequency

g(ω, ω0) =

which is equivalent to asserting that locally the ﬁltering being done has a Q of 1 at
1/√2 of the local resonant frequency. Then the overall gain G is obtained by cascading
these ﬁlters; we replace the product of the gains with an exponential of the sum of the
logarithms of the gains, and replace the sum by an integral, to get

log G(ω, ω0) =

log g(ω, ωi)

we

if we think the ﬁlters are distributed on an exponential scale (usual model for the middle
portion of the basilar membrane, since there is an approximately exponential stiffness);
here ωe is the entry frequency of the cochlea, e.g., 20 kHz. Thus, the amplitude X at
the top portion of the path at a position labelled ω0 (i.e., CF=ω0) as a result of an input
with amplitude F and frequency ω is

Xω0(F, ω) = F G(w, w0)

and since the integrals can be computed analytically there is a closed form expression
for X; the expression involves second-order polylogs Li2 and is not particularly illu-
minating, so we skip it here. Please notice that the form of g is arranged so that G has
indeed a maximum at ω0 because log g(ω, ω0) changes sign at ω0. The response R of
a Hopf oscillator forced by amplitude X at frequency ω given an internal frequency ω0
is given by the root of the cubic

X 2 = R6 + (ω

and so the entire contribution of any one path can be analytically computed. The ﬁnal
response shall be the sum over all paths through intermediate points ω0, which obvi-
ously depends upon how we weight the density of local ω0s. For simplicity, I shall
keep compatibility with the reasoning above and keep the ω0 exponentially distributed,
thus the density will equal d log w0 = dω0/w0. In addition, we need to keep track of
the relative phases of different paths; the phase lag for both the linear ﬁlter portion and
the Hopf elements are all computable in closed form. Therefore the entire model is
solvable in principle as quadratures of a complex function.

Figure 4. Maximal path contribution to the ﬁnal result. In (a) the linear
TW response and the Hopf active elements are “aligned”, meaning their
resonant frequencies coincide; in (b) they are displaced by a factor of 1.3.
CF at observation point is 1000 Hz. Please note that the response divides
into two clear regimes: ω < ωf , to the left of the CF, looks like the Hopf
resonance described in [4, 5], while to the right of the CF, when ω > ωf ,
all curves are nonlinearly compressed through a cubic root law. Evidently
(a) may not have a sharp tuning curve, for even though the high-frequency
regime is nonlinearly compressed, it impinges on the maximum with zero
slope.
(b) has a sharp tuning curve. The implication is that the Hopf
elements need to be tuned at higher frequencies than the maximum of the
passive TW component.

A ﬁrst, qualitative examination of this model can be achieved by remarking that the
response is going to be dominated by a single path through this graph, the one with the
highest amplitude. For frequencies ω lower than the CF wf this path will go through the
the top line and then shift down on the last Hopf oscillator, the one corresponding to the
current position. Thus all lower frequencies than the CF respond exactly like a single
Hopf oscillator composed with a weak linear ﬁlter. For frequencies higher than the CF,
to lowest order the dominant path is the one which goes through the Hopf oscillator
whose resonance frequency ωo equals that of the input, ω; thus the response, for all

frequencies higher than the CF, look approximately like the response at the position
whose CF equals the input frequency, composed with the bottom part of the path, which
is a linear attenuation. Thus, to the right of the CF, all curves stay nonlinearly saturated
and just drop down together. The plot is on Figure 4. Because the response of a Hopf
element at ω = ω0 is simply a cubic root, we have a particularly simple expression for
the shape of the response to the right of the resonance:

where we can see explicitly that the response goes like the cubic root of the input times
a ﬁlter. While the formula looks right on paper, a plot of the response quickly shows
not all is well: if the Hopf elements and the TW have coincident resonances a sharp
tuning curve does not obtain, see Figure 4b.

Figure 5. Tuning curves obtained by intersecting Fig 4b with speed levels
100 and 1000.

This picture changes if we take into account all paths, because the broadening of the
Hopf response at higher intensities means that the number of paths that contribute
signiﬁcantly to the ﬁnal result changes with intensity. However, we also need to keep
track of relative phases. If phases are not taken into account at all we obtain a “wrong”
result: because the width over ω0 for which the contribution is signiﬁcant increases
as a 2
3 power law [4], the nonlinear compression would be utterly obliterated in the
high-frequency regime. There is a trivial solution to this problem (following the classic
“Cornu spiral” construction): if the paths have rapidly varying phases, then only the
maxima and the stationary points of phases can contribute. For simplicity we shall stay
with the maximal path contribution only.

The tuning curve is the inverse of the function computed above with respect to input
and output amplitudes. The slope of this curve can be intuitively understood as how
many lines of the response graph do we intersect as we move horizontally per unit of
frequency change. This number clearly relates to what the slope of the lines is in the
graph, times how many lines do we intersect as we move vertically: the more vertically
bunched the lines are, the more bunched they are horizontally. Thus the immediate

7

effect of the nonlinear saturation is to triple the number of decibels per octave supplied
by the asymptotic front of the traveling wave on the steep right hand ﬂank of the tuning
curve. Furthermore the bunching and enveloping on the lines on the right hand side do
not just result in a steep right side ﬂank, but also in some invariance of the tuning curve
to the level of response required: as we change our horizontal line up and down, the
tuning curve does not substantially change shape.

At this point a detailed discussion of the relationship between this (trivial) model
and various well established models in the literature, like Chadwick or Mammano and
Nobile, should ensue, but I feel it’s better left for a later occasion. Also from this
model one can verify the assymetry between the two cubic combination tones (i.e.,
when f1 > f2 the combination tone 2f1

f2 is stronger than 2f2

f1). Etc.

I am deeply indebted to Jim Hudspeth, Victor Martinez-Eguiluz, Boris Shraiman,
Oreste Piro and Bruce Knight for many fruitful discussions about propagation of sound
in the cochlea and its effect on the tuning curves. In particular I owe to Victor Martinez-
Eguiluz the observation that the presence of saturation on the right hand side of Fig
2 agrees with the traveling wave moving from high to low frequencies. I am further
indebted to Yong Choe, Mark Ospeck, Pascal Martin and Frank Julicher for discussions
on the role of Hopf bifurcations in auditory detection.

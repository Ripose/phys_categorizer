We give an explicit formula for the membrane potential of cells in terms of the intracellular
and extracellular ionic concentrations, and derive equations for the ionic currents that ﬂow through
channels, exchangers and electrogenic pumps. We demonstrate that the work done by the pumps
equals the change in potential energy of the cell, plus the energy lost in downhill ionic ﬂuxes through
the channels and exchangers. The theory is illustrated in a simple model of spontaneously active
cells in the cardiac pacemaker. The model predicts the experimentally observed intracellular ionic
concentration of potassium, calcium, and sodium. Likewise the shapes of the simulated action
potential and ﬁve membrane currents are in good agreement with experiments. We do not see any
drift in the values of the concentrations in a long time simulation, and we obtain the same asymptotic
values when starting from the full equilibrium situation with equal intracellular and extracellular
ionic concentrations.

I. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of the work we present here is to obtain a model for the membrane potential of a single cell which is
reasonably realistic, and yet so simple that it can be used in practice to simulate numerically single cells or several
coupled cells. For simplicity, experimentally observed currents (Boyett et al. 1993) are omitted if they seem too small
to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the intracellular ion concentration, or at least too small to change the dynamics of
the cell. On the other hand, we try to make the theory realistic by using equations that are compatible with, or can
be derived from, basic physical principles.

It is a basic assumption of most models (Wilders 1993) for the electrical activity of cells that only the motion
of positive ions, and speciﬁcally those of potassium, calcium and sodium, inﬂuence the membrane potential. This
assumption is usually expressed as a diﬀerential equation for the time dependence of the potential. We observe that
this diﬀerential equation can be integrated exactly, and argue that the integration constant is given by the requirement
that the potential is zero when the ion concentrations on both sides of the membrane are equal, as the density of
negative charge happens to be the same on both sides. Then it follows that the potential is directly proportional to
the excess number of positive ions inside the cell, a formula which is nothing but the one for an electric capacitance
that follows from Gauss’s law in electrostatics.

We derive equations for ionic currents ﬂowing through channels, exchangers and electrogenic pumps. These are
based on the Boltzmann distribution law (Boltzmann 1868), which states that a particle in thermal equilibrium spends
less time in states of higher energy than in states of lower energy, the Markov assumption (Markov 1906) which says
that the transition probabilities of a stochastic system (of Markov type) is only dependent on its present state, and
the principle of detailed balance (Onsager 1931) which says that the microscopic laws of physics are invariant with
respect to the reversal of time. Our equations were inspired by Ehrenstein and Lecar’s model of channel gating (1977),
Nonner and Eisenberg’s model for channel current (1998), Mullins’ model of the Na+, Ca2+ exchanger (1977), and
Chapman’s model of the Na+, K+ pump (1978). In particular the book of Lorin John Mullins (1981) “Ion Transport
in Heart” has been a major source of inspiration for us.

The theory is illustrated with a simple model of spontaneously active cells in the rabbit sinoatrial node. The
(1988),
observable parameters in the model are based on the experiments of Shibasaki (1987), Hagiwara et al.
Muramatsu et al.
(1996) and Sakai et al. (1996). The non–observable parameters in the model are determined
numerically, in the same way as in an earlier study (Endresen 1997a), by comparing the action potentials generated
by the model with the shape of the action potentials recorded by Baruscotti et al. (1996).

By using an algebraic equation for the potential in place of the standard diﬀerential equation, as mentioned above,
we obtain a model which is stable against a slow drift of the intracellular ion concentrations, sometimes seen in other
models. Furthermore, by ﬁxing the integration constant for the voltage we obtain from the model a prediction of the
steady state ion concentrations in the cell. It is even possible to predict these steady state concentrations by starting
with an initial state having equal concentrations inside and outside the cell, and integrating the equations of motion
over a long time interval.

1

From the equations of motion we obtain an equation that explicitly demonstrates the energy balance in the process
of moving ions in and out of the cell. The energy to make the cell function comes from breakdown of ATP that runs
the Na+, K+ pump. Part of this free (or useful) energy is dissipated while the rest enters the cell. In the cell some of
this energy is used to create a potential energy that depends upon the ionic concentrations in the cell, while the rest
is dissipated by the currents in the ionic channels and the Na+, Ca2+ exchanger. This potential energy function is
thus such that the work associated with ionic currents balances exactly the change in potential energy. In a numerical
integration of the diﬀerential equations one may compute separately the work and potential energy, comparing the
two in order to check (and maybe control) the accuracy of the numerical integration. In our long time integration we
observe indeed a balance between work and change in cell membrane potential energy.

II. DERIVATION OF THE EQUATIONS

A. The Nernst Equilibrium Potential

There are two basic principles behind the average motion of particles. The ﬁrst is diﬀusion, which is general; the
second applies only to charged particles such as ions in solutions. Simple diﬀusion is described by the empirical law
of Fick (1855),

where φ is the ionic ﬂux, [S] the concentration of ions and u the ratio of the velocity to the force acting on a particle,
known as the mobility. T is the absolute temperature and k is Boltzmann’s constant. The empirical law of Ohm
(1827) describes the net motion of charged particles in an electric ﬁeld,

~φ = −ukT ∇[S] ,

~φ = −zeu[S]∇U ,

where z is the valence, e the elementary charge and U the electrical potential. Since we assume that the temperature
is constant, we can neglect the thermal ﬂux given by Fourier’s empirical law. The fact that the mobility in Fick’s law
must be identical to the mobility in Ohm’s law was ﬁrst noticed by Einstein (1905). If we combine Eqs. (1) and (2),
the total ﬂux of ions due to diﬀusion and electric forces is

The equilibrium potential for which the ﬂux is zero, is

It can be found by setting ~φ = 0 in Eq. (3) and integrating from the extracellular (e) to the intracellular (i) side
of the membrane. Here Ui, Ue, [S]i and [S]e are the intracellular and extracellular potentials and concentrations.
This equation, ﬁrst stated by Nernst (1888) is based only on the empirical laws of Ohm and Fick and the relation of
Einstein.

The same formula can be derived in a more general way using the Boltzmann factor (Boltzmann 1868). The relative

probability at equilibrium that an ion is at the intracellular or extracellular side of a cell membrane is

where ze(Ui − Ue) is the energy diﬀerence between the two positions of the ion. Solving (5) for Ui − Ue gives (4).

Imagine that ionic channels are either completely open or completely closed and randomly ﬂuctuate between these

states in a simple Markov process (Markov 1906), described by the ﬁrst order kinetics (Ehrenstein and Lecar 1977)

where the rate constants α and β are functions of transmembrane voltage and control the transitions between the
closed (C) and the open (O) states of the gate. The rate for a closed channel to open is α, and β is the rate for an
open channel to close. Let x denote the average fraction of channels that are open, or, equivalently, the probability
that a given channel will be open. We may say that the ionic ﬂux through an ensemble of channels is regulated by a
sliding door whose position is x. This yields:

where

Here x∞ denotes the steady state fraction of open channels and τ the relaxation time. Let us assume that the energy
diﬀerence between the open and closed positions is given by

where q is a gating charge, usually q ≈ ±4e, such that qv represents the change in electrical potential energy due
to the redistribution of charge during the transition, and where the term qvx represents the diﬀerence in mechanical
conformational energy between the two states. At equilibrium, dx/dt = 0, and the ratio of the probabilities for a
single channel to be in the open state or the closed state is

This relation is known as the principle of detailed balance (Onsager, 1931). The same ratio is given by the Boltzmann
distribution (Boltzmann 1868),

Thus, from Eqs. (14), (15), and (16), with q = +4e

2. Ion Channel Current

Here we want to obtain the current i through a one–dimensional ionic channel of length d. We will allow the cross
sectional area A to vary with position, i.e., we take A = A(x). By deﬁnition, x = −d/2 is the inside and x = d/2
the outside of the membrane. Let φ = φ(x) be the x-component of the ﬂux ~φ, the other components are negligible as
long as the variation of A with x is smooth and slow. This is the analogue of water ﬂow in a pipe of varying cross
section. By stationary ﬂow, the current i must be the same through all cross sections, i.e. independent of x. Thus
the ﬂux φ is inversely proportional to the area A, by the relation

We insert φ from this equation in the x component of Eq. (3), and multiply the resulting equation by
exp (ze(U − U0)/kT ), introducing a constant voltage U0 chosen such that

i = zeφA = const.

Then we ﬁnd that

Here U , [S] and A are functions of x, while all other quantities are constant. (Note however that the mobility u may
be reduced in a very narrow channel; one possible way to take into account such an x dependence of u is to replace
the area A by an eﬀective area Aeﬀ which is smaller than A). Integrating from the inside x = −d/2 to the outside
x = d/2 we obtain

Now the integral I depends upon both the voltage U = U (x) and the cross section A = A(x). To determine the
x dependence of U (x) one would need Poisson’s equation for the electrostatic potential, taking into account the net
charge distribution in the membrane, including both positive and negative ions. However, this charge distribution
will depend upon detailed properties of membranes and their channels that have been little known so far. Thus it
seems a reasonable approach to make certain assumptions directly about U (x).

A commonly used assumption is that U (x) is linear, i.e. that the electric ﬁeld −dU/dx is constant, and that the

cross section is constant, A(x) = A0. Then Eq. (26) takes the form

(cid:17)

As should be expected, this relation simpliﬁes to the usual Ohm’s law in the special case [S]i = [S]e, since then vS = 0
by Eq. (4). Eq. (27) is known as the Goldman constant ﬁeld approximation. Goldman (1943) wrote:

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

We assume that the membrane contains a large number of dipolar ions near the isotonic point and that these can act to

minimize distortion in the ﬁeld especially at low currents. We then approach a situation in which the ﬁeld is constant and
are led to a solution analogous to that given by Mott (1939) for electronic conduction in the copper–copper oxide rectiﬁer.

A more general case, perhaps somewhat more realistic, where the integral I can still be calculated exactly, is that
of an ion channel having a constant area A0, except for a short and narrow constriction or pore in its middle, with
an area Ap much smaller than A0. An example is a cylindrical pore of radius 3 ˚A and length 5 ˚A, which is typical for
ionic channels. If we furthermore assume a constant electric ﬁeld everywhere in the channel, and if the length of the
pore is ǫd, then we have that

The limit of this as v → 0 is

The last approximation holds when the contribution from the pore dominates the integral, which will be the case
e.g. when the ratio of areas, Ap/A0, is of the order ǫ2. For ǫv small but nonzero the v dependence of I is only of
second order in ǫv, thus it will be a good approximation in a ﬁnite voltage range to take I to be constant, equal to I0.
The approximation I = constant which is also valid under more general conditions than those assumed in the above
oversimpliﬁed derivation, and it gives

Here kS is independent of v, e.g. in the case considered above,

For Na and K ions it is a good approximation to consider the square root of the concentrations

[S]e[S]i constant,
while for Ca ions the relative change in concentration is more signiﬁcant during one action potential. In the present
work we used kS = constant in all three cases, for simplicity. We have checked that this does not aﬀect our numerical
results signiﬁcantly.

p

There is reason to ask whether the linear voltage proﬁle U (x) can be a reasonable approximation in the presence
of a pore. Indeed, it might seem natural to conclude that most of the voltage drop must be concentrated at the pore
due to its large resistance. However, with the combined Ohm’s and Fick’s law, the current is driven by gradients in
both voltage and concentration, as follows from Eq. (3). A large current may be due to a large voltage drop over
the pore, or it may be due to a large change in concentration, without any large voltage diﬀerence. Thus, in general
one has to take into account the detailed properties of the channel in order to see which one of the gradients is the
dominant driving force in a given situation.

In a recent investigation by Nonner and Eisenberg (1998), Poisson’s equation relating the net charge density and
electrostatic potential was included in a more extensive analysis for a speciﬁc model of a channel with a narrow pore.

In their analysis they indeed ﬁnd that only part of the voltage drop is across the pore (something like half of it).
In their numerical simulations the voltage in the pore is dominated by the presence of charged carboxyl groups, and
thus almost independent of the transmembrane voltage. This lends support to the approximation used here, that the
integral I, Eq. (25), can be regarded as being constant.

Thus our simple result (30) has the characteristic features of the current–voltage relationships obtained by Nonner
and Eisenberg in their more extensive investigation. One characteristic feature is that Eq. (30) shows inward rec-
increased conductance for large negative potentials. Indeed the curves in
tiﬁcation for large values of [S]e/[S]i, i.e.
ﬁgure 3A in Nonner and Eisenberg (1998) have shapes of a hyperbolic sine. Such a behavior is not predicted by the
Goldman (1943) equation, Eq. (27), but is seen in many excitable cells (Hille 1992). This is another reason to base
our computations on Eq. (30) in order to see the consequences of its application.

4. Calcium and Sodium Channels

The calcium and sodium channels have an inactivation mechanism in addition to the above activation mechanism.
We can view these mechanisms as two independent Markov processes, or equivalently two independent sliding doors,
which are both aﬀected by voltage. An ion can only go through if both sliding doors are at least slightly open. Here
the activation mechanism is very fast, with a time constant of only a few milliseconds, so we use the steady state
fraction of open channels, Eq. (17), for this. The maximum time constant of inactivation for calcium and sodium
channels are of the same order of magnitude as the maximum time constant of the activation of the potassium channel
(typically a few hundred milliseconds), thus

Note that the activation and inactivation mechanisms work in the same way, and diﬀer in two respects only. First,
the time constants diﬀer experimentally by two orders of magnitude, and second, the gating charge q, Eq. (14), is
+4e in one case and −4e in the other case.

C. Na+, K+ Pump

The Na,K–ATPase is found in the plasma membrane of virtually all animal cells and is responsible for active
transport of sodium and potassium. Low sodium concentration and high potassium concentration in the cytosol are
essential for basic cellular functions such as excitability, secondary active transport, and volume regulation. In our
model, the Na+, K+ pump is the only energy source. We shall assume that the following equation is a complete
macroscopic description of the pump reaction (Chapman 1978),

ATP + 3Na+

i + 2K+

ADP + Pio + 3Na+

e + 2K+

α⇀↽

β

where ATP, ADP and Pio are adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosophate and inorganic phosphate, while α and
β are the rates for the forward and backward reactions. The energy involved in the movement of 3 Na+ and 2 K+
ions against their electrochemical gradients is

where vK and vNa are given by Eqs. (7) and (9). This result is independent of the detailed interaction between ions,
molecules and the ATPase enzyme. Therefore, the total change in Gibbs free energy is

∆GNa = −3e(v − vNa)
∆GK = +2e(v − vK) ,

∆G = ∆GATP + ∆GNa + ∆GK

= e(vATP + 3vNa − 2vK − v) ,

where ∆GATP is the energy associated with the breakdown of ATP, and vATP = ∆GATP/e. Note that ∆G has to be
negative, at least when averaged over time, but the sum ∆GNa + ∆GK may very well be positive, since ∆GATP is
large and negative. Thus, part of the energy from ATP breakdown goes into increasing the free energy of potassium
and sodium ions, but much energy is dissipated, since the energy available is actually much larger than the energy
required to translocate the potassium and sodium ions at small negative membrane potentials.

In practice, such a pump or motorized swing door will quickly reach saturation. We therefore choose the sum of the
forward and backward rates to be constant, resembling the maximum possible speed of the swing door in the forward
and backward directions,

where λ is a constant. At equilibrium, the forward reaction must occur just as frequently as the reverse reaction,

D. Na+, Ca2+ Exchanger

To maintain a steady state for the intracellular calcium concentration in for example heart cells, the amount of
calcium that enters the cell via ionic channels must be extruded. The Na+, Ca2+ exchanger is the major mechanism
responsible for achieving a balance between calcium entry and extrusion in oscillating cells. We assume that the rate
for the forward (α) and the backward (β) exchange reaction given by (Mullins 1977)

are governed largely by the electrochemical gradients for sodium and calcium, together with the membrane potential.
In other words, the energy produced when 3 extracellular sodium ions take the elevator down into the cytosol is used
to elevate one calcium ion up from the cytosol into the extracellular space,

where vCa and vNa are given by Eqs. (8) and (9). The total work done in reaction (46) is

∆G = ∆GNa + ∆GCa = e(v − 3vNa + 2vCa) .

The ratio of α to β in Eq. (46) is again determined by ∆G like in Eq. (41). However, in the present case saturation
eﬀects are not expected and furthermore ∆G will vary around zero, so we put

E. Membrane Voltage

Imagine that the electrical activity of a cell is described by the ﬁve currents discussed above, and that all the
other currents (Boyett 1996) are of minor importance. The standard diﬀerential equations for the voltage, and the
conservation laws for intracellular ionic concentrations are then

where C is cell capacitance, F is Faraday’s constant, and we assume that the cell volume V is constant. Now Eqs. (54),
(55) and (56) can be solved for iK, iCa, and iNa, and we obtain

Inserting this into Eq. (53) yields

This integrated gives

where the integration constant v0 has to be determined. Given that the voltage across a capacitor is zero when the

This choice of v0 depends on the assumption that all other ions have the same concentrations on both sides, consistent
with Eq. (53) where it is assumed that they do not contribute to the current. This is also consistent with standard
assumptions in the literature (Encyclopædia Britannica 1997)

In the extracellular ﬂuid, electroneutrality is preserved by a balance between a high concentration of Na+ on the one hand
and a high concentration of Cl
as well as small quantities of impermeant anions such as bicarbonate, phosphate, and sulfate
on the other. In the cytoplasm, where K+ concentration is high, the concentration of Cl
is much below that necessary to
balance the sum of the positive charges. Electroneutrality is maintained there by negatively charged impermeant proteins

and phosphates. Osmotic balance is maintained between the extracellular ﬂuid and the cytoplasm by movement of water
through the plasma membrane when the total concentration of particles on one side is not equal to that on the other.

Eq. (64) is nothing but the relation between electric potential and charge of a capacitor, which is actually the origin
of Eq. (53). Thus it is completely general and independent of the number of membrane currents in a model. It means
that:

The voltage across the membrane of a cell is caused by, and is directly proportional to, the surplus of charge
inside the cell.

Since Eq. (64) is the explicit integral of Eq. (53), it can be used instead of Eq. (53) (or the equivalent of Eq. (53)) in
any model. The diﬀerential equation, Eq. (53), is needed only in models where the intracellular ionic concentrations
are not tracked individually (for example, the Hodgkin–Huxley equations (1952)).

There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between Eqs. (53) and (64) for use in numerical simulations, for the following reason.
There are two diﬀerent ways to determine how many ions there are inside a cell. The ﬁrst method counts every ion
entering or leaving (Eq. (53)), while the second method counts all the ions inside the cell (Eq. (64)). Both methods
will give correctly the variation in the number of ions in the cell. However, the observer of ions entering and leaving
observes only the variations in the number, and if he wants to know the actual number, he must make an initial guess
of the number of ions already inside. Because his guess may diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the actual ion number, the results
from the two methods may be contradictory.

A variant of Eq. (64) has recently been derived by Varghese and Sell (1997). However, they did not identify the
integration constant v0, which is related to the initial ionic concentrations and represents the initial net charge via
the electric capacitance of the cell as shown in Eq. (64).

There is reason to ask whether it is a reasonable approximation to omit the anions in Eq. (64). This can be justiﬁed
if the total concentration of cations is approximately the same on both sides. Indeed, this property is seen in most
ionic models, like for instance in Wilders (1993), where the cation concentrations are

[K]e = 5.4 mM [Ca]e = 2 mM
[Na]e = 140 mM
[K]i = 140 mM [Ca]i = 0.0000804 mM [Na]i = 7.5 mM .

F. Energy Balance and Osmotic Pressure

The current i in Eq. (21) may be written as

i = ze

dn
dt

,

where n is the number of ions transferred from the inside to the outside of the membrane, and dn/dt is the rate of
transfer. The change in free energy when one ion is transferred, is ∆G = −ze(v − vS), and the total change in free
energy over a time interval is

∆G = −

ze(v − vS) dn = −

i (v − vS) dt .

n

Z

t

It follows from Eq. (30) that the current i has the same sign as the voltage v − vS as required in general to have
thermodynamic stability, so that the integrand in Eq. (67) is positive (strictly speaking non-negative), and therefore
∆G < 0 (or ∆G ≤ 0).

By similar reasoning, taking into account all the reversal potentials and the free energy associated with the break-

down of ATP, we ﬁnd that the total change in free energy due to the ﬁve currents in our model is

∆G = −

[iK(v − vK) + iCa(v − vCa) + iNa(v − vNa)

+ iNaCa(v − 3vNa + 2vCa) + iNaK(v + 2vK − 3vNa − vATP)] dt .

Each of the ﬁve terms in the integrand is positive (non-negative), since each current has the same sign as the
In other words, energy is dissipated all the time by all the ﬁve currents, implying that

∆G ≤ 0.

The main contribution to the negative ∆G is the ATP term,

which in practice is negative all the time, and furthermore is large in magnitude compared to the other terms. It
should be noted that this term is the source of useful energy that is dissipated to maintain the activity of the cell
and keep it away from equilibrium. Keeping this term apart, we may calculate the change in free energy of the ionic
system,

∆Gions = ∆G − ∆GATP

[iK(v − vK) + iCa(v − vCa) + iNa(v − vNa)

+ iNaCa(v − 3vNa + 2vCa) + iNaK(v + 2vK − 3vNa)] dt .

(70)

Using Eqs. (53), (57), (58), and (59) to eliminate the currents, and assuming the capacitance C and the volume V to
be constant, we get that

In passing it may be noted that in the present case the equilibrium state is simply the one with equal concentrations
of cations on both sides, as follows from our assumption of having the same concentration of anions or negative charge
on both sides of the membrane. More generally equilibria for ionic systems are described by the Donnan (1911)
equilibrium that can yield diﬀerent concentrations on both sides of the membrane.

Since ∆Gions is a function only of the state of the cell and is independent of the process by which the state is
reached, it represents a potential energy for the cell, which we will call P . Note that P = 0 in the equilibrium state,
whereas P > 0 in all other states. P is the minimum energy needed to bring a thermal system away from equilibrium
with its surroundings, or equivalently, the maximum work that can be performed by the system when returning to
equilibrium.

The potential energy P , as deﬁned in Eq. (73), contains three terms, each of which can be given a more direct
physical interpretation. The ﬁrst term is simply the electrostatic energy of a capacitor, while the two temperature
dependent terms are related to thermal properties. In fact, since we assume ideal dilute solutions, the change in
entropy due to changes of ion concentrations away from their equilibrium values is

Under the same changes, the change in osmotic pressure inside the cell is equal to the diﬀerence in osmotic pressure
across the membrane, which is, for ideal solutions,

(cid:26)

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

π = RT ([K]i − [K]e + [Na]i − [Na]e + [Ca]i − [Ca]e) .

Note that for ﬁxed volume the anions will not contribute to the diﬀerence in osmotic pressure, but they will contribute
if the volume is changed and the membrane is impermeable to them. In terms of the change in transmembrane voltage,

v, the change in entropy, s, and the change in transmembrane osmotic pressure, π, as compared to the equilibrium

(76)

Equation (75) is the van’t Hoﬀ equation (1887) for the osmotic pressure across a solute impermeable barrier
In 1887 van’t Hoﬀ noticed that the behavior of solutes in dilute solutions
separating two ideal dilute solutions.
resembles the behavior of a perfect gas (van’t Hoﬀ, 1887), and as quoted by Arrhenius in a memoir edited by Jones
(1899):

The pressure which a gas exerts at a given temperature if a deﬁnite number of molecules is contained in a deﬁnite volume, is
equal to the osmotic pressure which is produced by most substances under the same conditions, if they are dissolved in any

given liquid.

Rewriting Eq. (73), using Eqs. (70) and (76), we may summarize the energy balance in the following way,

−

iNaK(v + 2vK − 3vNa) dt =

Cv2 − sT − πV

(77)

The left hand side of this equation is the useful work performed upon the cell by the Na+, K+ pumps, moving Na+
and K+ ions against their potential gradients. The energy supplied by the pumping of ions produces the following
eﬀects that either change the potential energy of the cell or cause energy loss by dissipation,

1. a transmembrane voltage diﬀerence, v;

2. a change in entropy, s;

3. a transmembrane osmotic pressure diﬀerence, π; and

4. downhill ionic currents through the exchangers and channels, iK, iCa, iNa, and iNaCa.

In an oscillating cell, as described by the present model, the following two inequalities will hold, over a suﬃciently

long time interval,

− ∆GATP = −

iNaK vATP dt > −

iNaK (v + 2vK − 3vNa) dt > 0 .

(78)

Z

Z
The ﬁrst inequality is simply the inequality iNaK(v + 2vK − 3vNa − vATP) > 0, which follows from Eq. (45). It means
that the energy released by breakdown of ATP is larger than the useful work performed by the pumps, as required
from general principles, in other words, that energy is dissipated by the current iNaK produced by the pumps. The
second inequality must hold due to Eq. (77), where the right hand side consists of three oscillating potential energy
terms plus four positive terms that describe energy dissipation. This inequality shows that the useful work performed
by the pumps is positive, as required to maintain the dissipation due to the other currents of a working cell away
from thermal equilibrium.

We may remark that the laws of Ohm and Fick, equations (1) and (2), are consistent with the use of ideal
solutions and osmotic pressure that assume independent (non–interacting) particles. Arrhenius (1902) wrote about
the relationship between osmotic pressure and diﬀusion:

Besides the electrical, other forces may be active in causing the movement of the ions. Of these the osmotic pressure is the

most important. On account of this pressure a phenomenon called diﬀusion (hydrodiﬀusion) may be observed.

In the model considered the osmotic pressure π has not been involved in the dynamics. However in an extended model
with variable volume V it will be more important as it will determine the solute ﬂux through the membrane.

III. A MODEL FOR CARDIAC PACEMAKER CELLS

In the above, a mathematical model of the membrane potential has been derived where Eqs. (7), (8), and (9)
represent the equilibrium potentials, Eqs. (32), (34), and (35) the ionic currents, Eqs. (52) and (45) the exchanger
and the pump currents, Eqs. (54), (55) and (56) the ionic concentrations, Eq. (64) the membrane voltage, and ﬁnally,
Eq. (76) the osmotic pressure across the cell membrane. The model has 6 time dependent variables x, f , h, [K]i, [Ca]i
and [Na]i, and the equations are summarized in Appendix A.

A. Ionic Mechanisms in the Cardiac Pacemaker

Akinori Noma published in 1996 an excellent review of the ionic mechanisms of the cardiac pacemaker potential
(Noma, 1996). In this short paper, Noma investigated the mechanisms that produce spontaneous activity in sinoatrial
node cells, and introduced the following overview of the relevant ionic currents.

Channel gating which drives membrane depolarization during diastole

• Deactivation of iK (iKr).

• Removal of inactivation of iCa,L and ist.

• Activation of the hyperpolarization–activated current (if ).

• Activation of L–type Ca2+ current (iCa,L).

• Activation of T–type Ca2+ current (iCa,T).

Background conductance

ib,Na : A cation current with reversal potential of about −20 mV.

iK,ACh : Spontaneous openings of the K+ channels.

iNaK : Na/K pump current.

iNaCa : Na/Ca exchange current.

iK,ATP : ATP sensitive K+ channels.

We will not try to determine the relative amplitude of the above current components here, but instead demonstrate
that only ﬁve membrane currents is suﬃcient to ensure stable intracellular ionic concentrations. These are iK, iCa,
iNaK, iNaCa, and iNa. In our model we assume that iCa,T and iKs are of minor importance; i.e. when we talk about
iCa we mean iCa,L, and when we talk about iK we mean iKr.

B. Model Parameters

The various parameters play diﬀerent roles in the model, and we list them in diﬀerent tables to distinguish between
fundamental physical constants (table I), experimentally observed constants (table II), adjustable parameters (table
III) and initial conditions (table IV) in the model. One parameter not listed is the gating charge q, Eq. (14), which
is the origin of the factor 2e/kT in Eqs. (32), (34) and (35). This corresponds to a slope factor for the activation
and inactivation curves of kT /4e ≈ 6.68 mV at 37◦C. The observed slope factors are 7.4 mV for activation of iK
(Shibasaki 1987), 6.6 mV for activation of iCa (Hagiwara et al. 1988), 6.0 mV for inactivation of iCa (Hagiwara et al.
1988), 6.0 mV for activation of iNa (Muramatsu et al. 1996), and, ﬁnally, 6.4 mV for inactivation of iNa (Muramatsu
et al. 1996). Hence, we see that kT /4e, corresponding to a gating charge of q ≈ ±4e, is a good approximation.

The half–activation and inactivation potentials in the model (vx, vd, vf , vm and vh) are based on the experiments
of Shibasaki (1987), Hagiwara et al. (1988) and Muramatsu et al. (1996), and we use a value of vATP that gives a

13

reversal potential for the sodium pump in good agreement with the experiments of Sakai et al. (1996). The maximum
time constants in these experiments were 203 ms for activation of iK (Shibasaki 1987), 225 ms for inactivation of iCa
(Hagiwara et al. 1988) and 174 ms for inactivation of iNa (Muramatsu et al. 1996). In the model, however, we combine
these and use a maximum time constant of 200 ms for both τK, τCa and τNa. Finally, we use typical values for cell
volume, cell capacitance, and extracellular ionic concentrations.

Two of the diﬀerential equations in the model have almost identical but opposite dynamics. If we modify the half–
inactivation potentials of calcium from vf = −25.0 mV to vf = vx = −25.1 mV, it is possible to relate the inactivation
gating of calcium to the activation gating of potassium by the equation

x + f = 1 ,

(79)

since the time constants for these two processes are equal. We have thus reduced the number of diﬀerential equations
in the model by one.

This computational saving will be irrelevant for the computation of one action potential, but is important in an

extended model with thousands of coupled cell, or in a long–time integration of the one cell model.

C. Pacemaker Current

The relative amplitude of the ionic currents that drive membrane depolarization during diastole is still a matter
of debate. DiFrancesco (1993) argues that the hyperpolarization activated current (if ) is the only current that can
generate and control the slow depolarization of pacemaker cells. The if current is normally carried by Na+ and K+.
Guo et al. (1995a; 1995b; 1996) reported another current, called the sustained inward current ist, where the major
charge carrier is believed to be Na+. Also a Ca2+ “window” current has been observed in rabbit sinoatrial node cells
(Denyer & Brown 1990). It is possible that any one of these currents, or a combination of them, is responsible for
membrane depolarization during diastole. However, the estimates of the net membrane current during diastole is so
imprecise (Zaza et al. 1997), that we could not form a judgment on the question.

During diastole the electrochemical driving forces produce outward K+ currents and inward Na+ and Ca2+ currents,
and the driving force for Ca2+ is much larger than that for Na+. These ﬁndings implies that a signiﬁcant background
inﬂux of Ca2+ is possible during diastole, and that this current might be responsible for the pacemaker activity in
sinoatrial node cells. We denote the conductance for this current kb,Ca, and modify (34) combined with (79) to read
as

iCa = [kCa (1 − x) d∞ + kb,Ca] sinh

(80)

v − vCa

(cid:18)

vT (cid:19)

,

with vT = kT /e. In our model kb,Ca is responsible for the slow diastolic depolarization, and it is thus our pacemaker
current. However, as suggested by Guo et al. (1995b), it is indeed possible that the sustained inward current ist may
largely replace the role of the Ca2+ currents, assumed here and in previous studies (Wilders 1993).

D. Adjustable Parameters

The density of ionic channels, exchangers and pumps (i.e. kCa, kb,Ca, kNa, kK, kNaK and kNaCa) can vary signiﬁcantly
from cell to cell. In order to reproduce recorded action potentials (Fig. 7 A. in Baruscotti et al. (1996)), we ﬁt the
adjustable parameters (table III) and the initial conditions (table IV) numerically. More details of the method are
given in (Endresen 1997a). Many diﬀerent combinations of kCa, kb,Ca, kNa, kK, kNaK, and kNaCa resulted in good
approximations to the experimentally recorded waveform, from which we conclude that diﬀerent cells can produce
the same action potential although they have diﬀerent mixtures of ionic channels, exchangers, and pumps.

The ﬁve diﬀerential equations in the model were solved numerically using a ﬁfth–order Runge–Kutta method with
variable steplength. More details are given in (Endresen 1997b). We computed the work W , deﬁned as minus the
integral on the right hand side of (70), to check that the equation W + P = 0 was satisﬁed numerically. This could also

E. Simulation Results

14

be used for varying the steplength in an eﬃcient way (Marthinsen et al. 1997), since the solution of our diﬀerential
equations must satisfy this constraint. These “checksum equations” are shown in Appendix B.

In Fig. 1 (a) the modeled action potential is shown together with the experimental curve of Baruscotti et al. (1996).
The curves are identical in shape, but we adjusted the modeled curve somewhat (we multiplied the voltage amplitude
by a factor 1.25, without changing the minimum value) to obtain the same voltage amplitudes. At present it is not
clear to us which mechanism is needed in the model in order to avoid this factor. Fig. 1 (b) shows the ﬁve membrane
currents in the model, iCa, iNa, iK, iNaK, and iNaCa.

Fig. 2 shows the spontaneous action potentials together with the intracellular ionic concentrations and the osmotic
pressure across the cell membrane. These computations used the initial conditions stated in table IV. Cells must
generate their membrane potential by actively transporting ions against the respective concentration gradients. To
examine this process in our model, we ran a simulation starting with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic
concentrations: [K]i = [K]e = 5.4 mM, [Ca]i = [Ca]e = 2 mM, and [Na]i = [Na]e = 140 mM. The results are presented
in Fig. 3, that shows the voltage and Nernst potentials (a), and the energies (b) in a long time simulation. After
approximately 750 seconds (12.5 minutes) the system reaches oscillations identical to the original oscillations shown
in Figs. 1 and 2 (this can not be seen from Fig. 3 since the time scale is very diﬀerent). This long time simulation is
a numerical indication that the oscillations in Fig. 2 and 3 indeed correspond to a stable limit cycle.

IV. DISCUSSION

We have presented a simple model for the cells of the rabbit sinoatrial node. Our model involves only Na+, K+, and
Ca2+ ions, their respective channels, the Na+, Ca2+ exchanger, and the Na+, K+ pump. The equations were derived
using basic physical principles and conservation laws. Since the only source of energy in our model is the sodium
potassium pump, we can easily track the ﬂow of energy, and show that the pump works to generate a transmembrane
voltage, osmotic pressure diﬀerence, and an entropy. Our equations also account for the energy lost due to downhill
ionic ﬂuxes through the exchanger and channels. A prediction of osmotic pressure variations is a novel result of our
energy analysis.

The intracellular ionic concentrations are dynamic variables in our model, governed by the conservation Eqs. (54),
(55), and (56). This allows us to replace the standard diﬀerential equation for the voltage (53) with the algebraic
Eq. (64). Although a number of other ionic models also keep track of intracellular ionic concentrations (see Wilders
(1993)), we are unaware of any other model using an algebraic equation for the membrane potential. Models that use
the standard voltage diﬀerential Eq. (53) have a phase space with one superﬂuous extra dimension. The initial condi-
tion for this extra diﬀerential equation cannot be chosen independently of the initial conditions for the conservation
Eqs. (54), (55), and (56) – if it is, the computed membrane potential will be erroneous. For these reasons, we suggest
that our algebraic expression for the membrane potential should replace the standard voltage diﬀerential equation in
models where intracellular ionic concentrations are dynamic variables.

Our model does not include the funny current (if ), ATP sensitive channels, stretch-activated channels, or other ion
channels that may be important (Boyett 1996). We also ignored the eﬀect of calcium uptake and release from the sar-
coplasmatic reticulum, which would aﬀect the Nernst potential of calcium, but not the membrane potential. We have
assumed that the ionic channels are governed by a Markov process, that the maximum of the activation/inactivation
time constant occurs at the same voltage as the inﬂection point of the sigmoidal steady state activation/inactivation
curve, and that the steady state activation/inactivation curves were temperature independent. Also, we have assumed
that the cell volume is constant. While such assumptions reduce the number of parameters in the model, they may
also result in discrepancies with experiment.

Finally, we would like to point out that our model is based on experiments where some were conducted at room
temperature (22–24◦C) (Baruscotti et al. 1996; Muramatsu et al. 1996), while others were performed at 37◦C
(Shibasaki 1987; Hagiwara et al. 1988; Sakai et al., 1996). It is not clear what eﬀect varying temperature has in our
model as this was not checked out numerically.

The values of the parameters kCa, kNa, kK, kNaK and kNaCa, given in table III, are only an estimate of the actual
physiological parameters. We did not systematically study the dynamics of the model for diﬀerent values of the
parameters, but we hope that future experiments will help to discriminate between diﬀerent parameter sets that may
reproduce the experimentally recorded action potentials.

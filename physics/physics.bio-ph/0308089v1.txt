Abstract

For a substance diﬀusing on a curved surface, we obtain an explicit relation valid for very

small values of the time, between the local concentration, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, the intrinsic

spatial curvature and the time. We recover the known solution of Fick’s law of diﬀusion in

the ﬂat space limit. In the biological context, this result would be useful in understanding the

variations in the diﬀusion rates of integral proteins and other molecules on membranes.

Introduction

Transport of enzymes, charged ions and metabolic substances within biological cells and tissues and

across cell membranes is one of the major processes which sustains and guides life. Indeed, extra-

cellular and intracellular transport of substances can well be considered to be the most important

and pervasive among all the life-supporting biological activities.

Molecular transport across cell membranes by passive diﬀusion or in accordance with Fick’s law

is a well-studied area. However in the available literature on the subject, no mention has been made

of how the local curvature of the cell plays a part, if at all, in this process. Molecules released at a

speciﬁc location on the cell surface or on the nuclear membrane diﬀuse along the curved membrane

surface to another location.

It is known that thermal agitation permits lateral diﬀusion of phospholipid and glycolipid molecules

within a leaﬂet of planar phospholipid bilayers of biological membranes. A lipid molecule can diﬀuse

several micrometres per second at a temperature of 37 degrees C. It has also been established

experimentally that many important proteins freely ﬂoat within the plane of the membrane.

Measurements have shown that the rates of diﬀusion of proteins in biomembranes are considerably

lower than those seen in artiﬁcial membranes [1,2]. The physical structure and the dynamical changes

occurring on a membrane surface would well be expected to play an important role in determining

the lateral mobility of molecules on its surface.

The metabolism and synthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids occur in the smooth endoplasmic

reticulum, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum is a site of protein synthesis.

It is well known

that in many cells these extensively curved and folded membrane vesicles are continuous with the

nuclear and cell membranes. In the cytosol also, these folds distort the homogeneity in the spatial

distribution of the cytosolic ﬂuid.

Transport of a substance by diﬀusion should therefore be described by a corrected form of Fick’s

law, modiﬁed to take into account the local curvature of the surface through which it moves.

In this paper we discuss how to take care of curvature eﬀects and also give for transient phenom-

ena, an explicit expression relating the concentration of the diﬀusing substance, the intrinsic spatial

curvature experienced by it, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the time.

2. Diﬀusion on curved surfaces

Consider diﬀusion of a substance described by its concentration C(x, t) from a spatial point x where
it has been released on the cell, to another point x′. For a particular time slice, the line element ds

between each pair of neighbouring points on the spatial surface is given by:

ds2 =

gij(x)dxidxj

n

Xi,j=1

where dxk denote the coordinate diﬀerences between neighbouring points, n is the spatial dimen-

sion and gij denotes the metric. We choose to work with a Riemannian signature for the metric.

The usual form of Fick’s law relates the current density or the ﬂux of material per unit area, j(x, t)

to its concentration gradient in ﬂat space :

ji(x, t) =

D∂iC(x, t)

−

where D denotes the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, ∂i denotes the gradient operator, and C(x, t) is the ﬁeld

variable denoting the concentration. It is assumed here that the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is independent

of the concentration of the diﬀusing substance.

In curved space, while formulating the problem, one must incorporate the eﬀects of the intrinsic

spatial curvature of the surface on which the substance is diﬀusing.

We make the simplifying assumption that in the inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of any point, the

diﬀusion properties are the same in all directions and that D does not depend upon the position

and the concentration of the diﬀusing material.

Transport of the substance by diﬀusion into and out of the invariant volume element √gdnx

surrounding the point x is given by the conservation equation :

∂C(x, t)
∂t

=

−∇iji(x, t)

where

∇i denotes the covariant derivative and includes the Christoﬀel connection Γk
∇ijk = ∂ijk + Γk

iljl

,

:

il

and we have considered a parametric dependence of C on the time t.

Performing a covariant diﬀerentiation of (2) with respect to x and substituting (3) in it we then get

the correct form of Fick’s second law of diﬀusion :

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

∂C(x, t)
∂t

=

D✷C(x, t)

−

where we have used ✷ to denote the n-dimensional Laplace-Beltrami operator. For ﬂat 3-dimensional
space, ✷ reduces to the usual 3-dimensional Laplacian.

It has been shown in [3] that at least in mitochondrial inner membranes, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D

of intramembrane particles shows an inverse correlation with their concentration, implying that the

proper form of Fick’s law reﬂecting the concentration dependence of D should be studied, rather

than equation (4). In our work however, we consider only the simplest form of Fick’s law with a

concentration-independent diﬀusion coeﬃcient, in order to see how far just the spatial curvature

eﬀects could modify the known result.

It becomes particularly interesting to learn about the conﬁguration of the released substance during

the initial inﬁnitesimal time intervals to see how the intrinsic curvature of the cell would inﬂuence

diﬀusive transport on the membrane surface and hence its conﬁguration at later times.

In order to solve (4), we rescale the time parameter by: t

Dt so that (4) now reads:

→

∂C(x, t)
∂t

= ✷C(x, t)

ηC(x, t)

−

and the parameter t now has the dimensions of length squared. We have introduced a drag term

ηC with η > 0 which can be thought to account for negative concentration changes due to possible

frictional eﬀects on the motion of the molecules. We have introduced it here just for the sake of

mathematical convenience and at the end of the calculations it can be set to zero.

In the actual physical situation, of course, the drag term is very much present and gets contributions

from the drag arising from the pericellular matrix viscosity, from steric eﬀects, and from transient

binding to relatively immobile structures [1]. Also in the actual situation, the η term is not constant

and has a coupling with the concentration gradient. We have however restricted ourselves to η = 0

for the sake of simplicity in this paper.

We assume that the molecules diﬀuse freely on the surface without interacting or binding with any

other molecules. We write equation (5) in a point-separated form as :

where the biscalar C(x, x′, t) is subject to the condition :

∂C(x, x′, t)
∂t

= (✷x −

η)C(x, x′, t)

and to the physical boundary condition:

C(x, x′, t) = C(x, t)

C(x, x′, t) = δ(x, x′

)

(10)

This enables us to get a well-deﬁned explicit solution for C(x, t) which is valid for small values

of t, in terms of the spatial curvature. The solution to (6) is well known [4-6]:

C(x, x′, t) =

(4πt)n/2 e−ηte− σ(x,x

)

2t ∆1/2(x, x′

)Ω(x, x′, t)

where the biscalar σ(x, x′) equals half the square of the geodesic distance between x and x′ and
∆(x, x′) is the VanVleck-Morette determinant :

∆(x, x′

) =

(g(x))

−1/2 det[

∂i∂j′ σ(x, x′

)](g(x′

))

−1/2

This is a biscalar quantity which reduces to unity in ﬂat space.
In curved space, one can expand ∆(x, x′) in a series expansion in powers of the curvature by working

in Riemann normal coordinates y which deﬁne a locally inertial system in the neighbourhood of the
point x′. In these coordinates [7], with origin at x′, ∆(x, x′) = (g(x))−1/2 , so that

In the coincidence limit, and for our purposes, it is only the ﬁrst term on the right hand

Here, I denotes the identity matrix, R stands for the Ricci scalar and the semicolon denotes a covari-

ant diﬀerentiation. Although the fourth Gilkey coeﬃcient has also been calculated in the literature,

we have displayed above only terms upto third order in the Riemann curvature.

Rescaling now t back to Dt we obtain the solution we seek for diﬀusion of molecules in the presence

of a drag term in n spatial dimensions for transient times :

For the standard diﬀusion equation without the η term, and in ﬂat space, the only Gilkey coef-

ﬁcient which contributes is E0 and in this case we recover the known result:

In a recent paper [8], Gompper and Goos have suggested that the diﬀusion of amphiphilic

molecules within a monolayer at the oil-water interface of the microemulsion phase in an oil-water-

amphiphile mixture can be used to measure the average Gaussian curvature of the monolayer. They

have considered surfaces of constant curvature. The result (14) we have discussed here for the

concentration, is valid for surfaces of varying curvature also.

In fact, from (14) it is an easy matter to get a general solution to the diﬀusion equation for

n-dimensional spaces with arbitrary constant curvature K for which the value of the Riemann cur-

vature depends neither on the coordinate x nor on the planar direction at x. For such spaces, the

Riemann curvature is given in terms of their metric gij by

K > 0 corresponds to the spherical surfaces while surfaces with K < 0 correspond to hyperboloid

ones — the K = 0 are ﬂat Euclidean surfaces.

It is shown in [8] that the structure of a microemulsion can be quantiﬁed in terms of a quantity

which depends upon the Euler characteristic χE of the surface within which the amphiphile molecules

diﬀuse. χE is obtained from the Gaussian curvature using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem :

dSK = 2πχE

Z

(19)

where the integral is over a closed surface S. It should be therefore possible in the case of surfaces

of approximately constant area, to express the result (18) in terms of the topological invariants

characterizing them, after appropriately scaling them. This exercise is however beyond the scope of

this report. Because of their enormous complexity, biological cells and membranes do not in general

have isotropic and homogeneous composition, and the membrane surfaces are more often than not,

of varying curvature, and in these situations, one needs to use (13) and (14) rather than (18).

For the speciﬁc case of diﬀusion in two dimensions such as on membranes, the coeﬃcients in

(13) simplify considerably because in these dimensions both the Riemann tensor Rijkl and the Ricci

curvature scalar R have only one component and both the Riemann tensor and the Ricci tensor Rij

can be expressed in terms of the curvature scalar R :

It must be borne in mind that in our treatment, we have regarded time as a parameter and the

indices i, j, k, l, µ, ν, α, β etc. label spatial dimensions only, for we are working on a particular time

slice at each instant of time.

We consider the simplest example of diﬀusion of a substance on the surface of a sphere of constant

radius r. For a 2-sphere, the Ricci curvature scalar is:

R =

2
r2 .

In fact, in this case, the Gaussian curvature K = 1

(21), or by simply using (17), the Gilkey coeﬃcients reduce for this example to:

essentially equivalent to the leading and next to leading order terms in (23).

In the series expansion in (14), (18) and (23), valid for very small t values, it is assumed that

the curvature terms are small in comparison with the ﬂat space result. Care must be taken before

applying the actual values of t, D and r to these expressions to ensure that this assumption is

satisﬁed.

For a substance having a D value of 10−6cm2s−1 released on the surface of a spherical cell of

radius 1µm , diﬀusing through a distance of 0.5µm in time 1ms, one obtains a calculated value of

4259.4751

104 per cm2 for its concentration, using the usual expression (15) for ﬂat space diﬀusion,

while the improved solution (23) gives an additional correction of 0.034 per cm2 to this – a diﬀerence

×

of 3.4% from the ﬂat space result, and a deviation of 0.33% from the ﬂat space results for a time
duration of 10−4s, while for a D value of 10−7cm2s−1, the deviations from the ﬂat space result for

time durations of 1ms and 0.1ms are 0.33% and 0.033% respectively.

The experimentally measured values of the concentrations, of course, correspond to the corrected

values and the curvature-corrected Fick’s law (14), since the diﬀusing molecules have already tra-

versed over the curved surface of the cell. However, it must be borne in mind that the diﬀusion

times measured and calculated, in fact, calibrate distances diﬀerent from the ﬂat space distances,

when one makes a comparison between diﬀusion rates on diﬀerent cells and on membranes whose

curvatures diﬀer from point to point and from one another. What we intend to point out here is

that one must remember that ﬂat space methods must not be applied when one is talking about

biological membranes and surfaces which are very curved, or even for surfaces with varying curva-

ture for which one must apply the coeﬃcients in (13). We have not included realistic eﬀects such as

8

drag terms arising from the viscosity of the cytosolic ﬂuid, and we have considered also only lateral

(2-dimensional) diﬀusion in this work.

It is seen that curvature eﬀects modify considerably the solution of the diﬀusion problem. In

the biological context, it is well known that depending upon the cell type, between 30-90 percent

of all integral proteins in the plasma membrane are freely mobile and among these, the lateral

diﬀusion rate of a protein in an intact membrane is around 10-30 times lower than that of the

same protein embedded in synthetic liposomes [1,2,9].

It has been suggested that this could be

because the mobility of the proteins might be hampered by interactions with the rigid submembrane

In arriving at those diﬀusion rates, these authors considered only the normal form of Fick’s law for

ﬂat space. Use of the correct form of Fick’s law taking into account the varying curvatures of the

membranes on which the protein molecules diﬀuse must be made when seeking to explain through

cytoskeleton.

such theories.

Discussion

We have shown how the curvature of the surface through which molecules diﬀuse modify the usual

form of Fick’s law and the relation between the concentration of the diﬀusing molecules, the diﬀusion

constant and the time.

Many intra-membrane particles are electrically charged and when they are subjected to an external

electric ﬁeld, move from their original random distribution to a more ordered distribution. It would

be interesting to see the eﬀect of external electromagnetic ﬁelds on molecules which are electrically

charged, diﬀusing on curved surfaces.

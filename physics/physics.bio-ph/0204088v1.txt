Dynamics of topological solitons describing open states in the DNA double helix are studied in the frame-
works of the model which takes into account asymmetry of the helix. It is shown that three types of topological
solitons can occur in the DNA double chain. Interaction between the solitons, their interactions with the chain
inhomogeneities and stability of the solitons with respect to thermal oscillations are investigated.

INTRODUCTION

It is widely accepted now that the DNA molecule has a
rather moveable internal structure, and that the internal DNA
mobility plays an important role in functioning the molecule.
The thermal bath where the DNA molecule is usually im-
mersed, collisions with the molecules of the solution which
surrounds DNA, local interactions with proteins, drugs or
some other ligands lead to activation of different types of in-
ternal motions. Small oscillations of individual atoms near
equilibrium positions, rotational, transverse and longitudinal
displacements of atomic groups (phosphate groups, sugars
and bases), motions of the double chain fragments having sev-
eral base pairs lengths, local unwinding of the double helix,
transitions of DNA fragments from one conformational form
to another, for example, from A-form to B-form and so on,
are only some of them. A more detailed list of internal mo-
tions and of their dynamical characteristics can be found in the
works of Fritzsche [1], Keepers and co-authors [2], McClure
[3], McCommon and co-authors [4], Yakushevich [5, 6]).

Different approaches to the modeling of the internal DNA
mobility are known. One of them has been developed by Pro-
hofsky and co-authors [7, 8, 9, 10], who considered DNA as a
lattice and took into account the motions of all atoms (except
of hydrogen atoms) in the lattice cell. Their approach was lim-
ited, however, by harmonic approximation, and this limitation
did not permit them to model large amplitude internal motions
such as, for example, local unwinding of the double helix. An-
other approach, based on the methods of molecular dynamics
and proposed ﬁrstly by Levitt [11] and Tidor and co-authors
[12], is known now as one of the most powerful tools of inves-
tigation of the internal DNA mobility [13]. This approach is
not limited by harmonic approximation and therefore it can be
used to study internal motions of both large and small ampli-

tudes. The approach has, however, one essential deﬁciency:
because of the limited possibilities of modern computers it
can not be used to study long DNA fragments, and therefore
it does not suitable for studies of the processes of propagation
of local structural distortions along the molecule.

In this paper, to investigate the internal DNA mobility, we
use the approach developed in a series of works [14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Peculiarity of the approach
is that it uses rather simple models of the internal DNA dy-
namics, which take into account only one or a few types of
the DNA internal motions. This simpliﬁcation gives an oppor-
tunity to ﬁnd analytical solutions of corresponding dynamical
equations imitating both small and large amplitude internal
motions. And one more merit of the approach is that it gives a
possibility to study the internal dynamics of long DNA frag-
ments. Three works in the series are of most interest.

The ﬁrst one has been done by Englander and co-authors
[14] who studied the dynamics of DNA open states. Their
model took into account only rotational motions of nitrous
bases, which as it was suggested, made the main contribu-
tion to formation of the open states. Another paper belonged
to Peyrard and Bishop [22], who studied the process of DNA
denaturation. Suggesting that the stretching of the hydrogen
bonds in pairs made the most contribution into the process,
they created a simpliﬁed model where only transverse mo-
tions of bases along the direction of the hydrogen bonds where
taken into account. The third important paper was published
by Muto and co-authors [21]. These authors suggested that
two types of internal motions were made the main contribu-
tion to DNA denaturation process: transverse motions along
the hydrogen bond direction and longitudinal motions along
the backbone direction. Their model consisted of two polynu-
cleotide strands linked together through the hydrogen bonds
described by a Lennard-Jones potential, and the phosphodi-
ester bridges in the backbone were described by an anhar-
monic Toda potential.

Further development of the approach was limited for sev-
eral years by small improvements of the models and their
combinations, and only involving numerical methods of sim-
ulation of the internal DNA dynamics gave a new impulse and

interesting possibilities which have been realized in the works
of Van Zandt [26], Techera and co-authors [27], Salerno [25],
Barbi [28, 29], and Campa [30]. Just these methods permitted
not only to study a possibility of appearance of large ampli-
tude localized distortions in the DNA structure, but also to
investigate their stability, the inﬂuence of thermal noise, the
interactions between the distortions, the propagation of them
along the homogeneous and inhomogeneous DNA.

In all these works, however, the asymmetry of the base
pairs was neglected. That is both bases in a pair were

modeled as identical structural elements with the same
characteristics (masses, moments of inertia and so on).
But even in the case of homogeneous (synthetic) DNA the
asymmetry exists. Indeed, if, for example, one of the polynu-
cleotide chains consists of only adenines, the other chain
should consist of thymines, and this homogeneous model is

model is studied in this work. To simplify calculations, we
consider only rotational motions of nitrous bases around
the sugar-phosphate chains in the plane perpendicular to
the main axis of the double chain. We ﬁnd solitary wave
solutions describing open states in the double helix. We
classify the solitons, investigate stability of the solitons with
respect
interactions between the
solitons, interaction of the solitons with inhomogeneities of
the chain. To solve all these problems, we use numerical-
variation methods efﬁciency of which was proved in the

nonlinear dynamics of molecular chains and polymer crystals.

II. DISCRETE MODEL OF THE DNA DOUBLE HELIX

Let us consider B-form of the DNA molecule, the fragment
of which is presented in Fig. 1. The lines in the ﬁgure cor-
respond to the skeleton of the double helix, black and grey
rectangles correspond to bases in pairs (AT and GC). Let us
focus our attention on the rotational motions of bases around
the sugar-phosphate chains in the plane perpendicular to the
helix axis. Below we shall call the chain placed on the left
by the ﬁrst chain, and the right chain – by the second one.
Positive directions of the rotations of the bases for each of the
chains are shown in Fig. 1.

Let us consider the plane DNA model where the chains of
the macromolecule form two parallel straight lines placed at
a distance h from each other, and the bases can make only
rotation motions around their own chain, being all the time
perpendicular to it. Let us suggest that ϕn,1 is the angular
displacement of the n-th base of the ﬁrst chain, and ϕn,2 is
the angular displacement of the n-th base of the second chain.
Then the Hamiltonian of the double chain takes the form

(cid:27)

The ﬁrst two terms of Hamiltonian (1) correspond to the ki-
netic energy of the n-th base pair. Here In,1 is the mo-
ment of inertia of the n-th base of the ﬁrst chain; In,2 is
the moment of inertia of the n-th base of the second chain,
point denotes differentiation in time t. For the base pair αβ
(αβ = AT, T A, CG, GC) the moment of inertia is equal

α, In,2 = mβr2

to In,1 = mαr2
β. The value of the base
mass mα, the length rα and corresponding moment of iner-
tia Iα = mαr2
α for all possible base pairs are presented in the
Table I.

The third and the fourth terms in Hamiltonian (1) describe
interaction of the neighboring bases along each of the macro-

j

3

molecule chains. Parameter ǫn,i characterizes the energy of
interaction of the n-th base with the (n + 1)-th base of the i-th
chain (i = 1, 2). The value of the parameter is unknown. But
if we take into account that angular displacement of one base
is accompanied not only by overcoming the barrier due to the
stacking interaction, but also by substantial deformation of the
dihedral and valence angles,we can suggest that the energy of
the displacement ǫn,i should be wittingly more than the stack-
ing 40 ÷ 60 kJ/mol [37], and it should weakly depend on the
type of the base. This gives us a possibility to suggest later on
that ǫn,1 ≡ ǫn,2 ≡ ǫ > 60 kJ/mol.

The ﬁfth term in Hamiltonian (1) corresponds to the energy

of interaction between conjugated bases of different chains.
Here index αβ =AT, TA, GC, CG determines the type of the
base pair. It is convenient to model the energy of interaction
of conjugated pairs by the potential

Vαβ (ϕn,1, ϕn,2) =

Kαβ|Rn − R◦

where Rn is the vector connecting the end of the base (n, 1)
with the end of the base (n, 2), R◦
n is the value of the vector
for the ground state of the chain ϕn,1 ≡ 0, ϕn,2 ≡ 0. Potential
(2) can be written in a more simple form

Vαβ(ϕn,1, ϕn,2) = Kαβ{rα(rα + rβ)(1 − cos ϕn,1) + rβ(rα + rβ)(1 − cos ϕn,2) − rαrβ[1 − cos(ϕn,1 − ϕn,2)]} .

The rigidity of interaction Kαβ can be estimated from the

The pair AT (TA) is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds (they
are shown in Fig. 1 by dotted lines), and the pair CG (GC) –
by three hydrogen bonds. Therefore we suggest later on that
eAT = eT A = 2eCG/3 = 2eGC/3 = e.

For the value of the energy of interaction of the bases in
AT base pair we can take the double energy of hydrogen bond
e = 40 kJ/mol. Then the rigidity of the bond between the
bases is equal to

On the other hand, the value of the parameter can be estimated
from the frequency spectrum of low amplitude oscillations of
the chain. We shall obtain it in the next section.

III. DISPERSION EQUATION

The system of equations of motion, which corresponds to

macromolecule Hamiltonian (1), takes the form

(ϕn,1(t), ϕn,2(t)) = (ϕ1, ϕ2)Aei(qan−ωt) ,

into the system of equations (5). Here (ϕ1, ϕ2) is a normal-
ized to 1 two dimension vector, A ≪ π is the amplitude,
q ∈ [0, π/a] is the wave number. It is easy to show that in
the linear approximation the frequency ω should satisfy the
dispersion equation

ω4 + Bω2 + C = 0 ,

The upper curve ω = ωo(q) corresponds to optical phonons,
the lower curve ω = ωa(q) corresponds to acoustic phonons
in the chain.

The frequency ωa(q) tends to zero as q → 0. Let us deter-

mine the velocity of acoustic phonons as

The dependence of the sound velocity v0 in the homogeneous

sented in the Table II.

ity of sound in DNA is on the interval from 1890 m/s till

Let us consider homogeneous macromolecule where only one
type of base pairs exists αβ (In,1 ≡ Iα, In,2 ≡ Iβ).

typical values ǫ = 60, 600, 6000 kJ/mol the value ǫ =

the numerical investigations of the dynamics of topological
solitons.

This estimation of the value of the rigidity differs from that
obtained in (4). The use of the value given in (4) gives sub-
stantially lower value of the frequency ωo(0) = 7.77 cm−1.
Thus we have the following estimation of the value of the pa-
rameter K: 0.234 ≤ K ≤ 4.744 N/m. The view of the disper-
sion curves for homogeneous chain (αβ = AT ) with different
values of the parameters is presented in Fig. 2.

For numerical investigation of the soliton dynamics we
shall take intermediate value K = 0.8714 N/m which cor-
responds to the frequency ωo(0) = 15 cm−1, and energy of
interaction eAT = 149 kJ/mol.

parameter of cooperativity

Complexity of the system of equations of motions (5) does
not permit us to carry out analytical investigation. Therefore,
we shall study it numerically and use variation technique, pro-
posed in [32], to ﬁnd soliton like solutions.

Let us consider homogeneous DNA molecule (for all n
In,1 = Iα, In,2 = Iβ, where αβ = AT (TA, CG, GC)). We
shall ﬁnd the solution of system (5) in the form of a wave with
smooth constant proﬁle. For the purpose, let us suggest that
ϕn,1(t) = ϕ1(ξ), ϕn,2(t) = ϕ2(ξ), where the wave variable
ξ = na − vt, and v is the velocity of the wave.

Let us assume, that the functions ϕ1 and ϕ2 smoothly de-
pend on ξ. Then the time second derivatives can be substituted
for discreet derivatives

d2ϕn,i
dt2 = v2 ∂ϕi

∂ξ2 = v2(ϕn+1,i − 2ϕn,i + ϕn−1,i)/a2,

(9)

i = 1, 2. Using these relations, we can write the equations of
motions (5) in the form

Lϕn,1 = 0, Lϕn,2 = 0, n = 0, ±1, ±2, ... .

Boundary conditions (14), (15) for the problem (13) deter-
mine the type of the soliton solution. We should take a rather
large number N , in order that the form of the solution of the
problem might not depend on its value. For the purpose it is
enough to take N ten times larger than the width of the soliton.
The soliton solution of the problem (13) can be character-
ized by the topological charge q=(q1, q2), where qi = (ϕ∞,i−
ϕ−∞,i)/2π, i = 1, 2, is an integer (qi = 0, ±1, ±2, ...). To
ﬁnd soliton solution with topological charge q, it is necessary
to solve the problem on minimum (13) with boundary condi-
tions

ϕ−∞,1 = ϕ−∞,2 = 0, ϕ∞,1 = 2πq1, ϕ∞,2 = 2πq2 .

This problem was solved by the method of conjugated gradi-
ent. The value N = 2000 was taken, and the initial point

ϕn,i = [1 + tanh µ(n − N/2)]πqi , i = 1, 2 ,

was used. Here µ is a changeable parameter.

V. DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLITONS

At the beginning let us consider stationary soliton solutions
of the problem (13). In the dimensionless functional ¯L, coefﬁ-
cients cα = cβ = 0 when v = 0. So, only one dimensionless
parameter g (12) which characterizes cooperativity of rota-
tional motions remains in functional (11). The existence of
soliton solution and its form depend on the value of the pa-
rameter.

A. Stationary solution

The results of numerical investigations of the problem (13)
show that in the homogeneous chains stationary topological
soliton solutions exist when the parameter of cooperativity g
is larger than the threshold value: g ≥ g0 > 0. The ab-
sence of the soliton topological stability when g < g0 can
be explained in the following way. Any topological defect
can be eliminated by turning the DNA bases. The turning of
one base about 360 degrees transfers the system to the initial
state, that is φi,n ≡ φi,n ± 2π. And this is why the narrow
solitons with the size equal to one link of the chain are equiv-
alent to the ground state and this is why they are unstable. So,
only relatively wide solitons with the general turning consist-
ing of several small changes of rotational angles that is when
|φi,n+1 −φi,n| ≪ 2π, are stable. Dependence of the threshold
value g0 on the soliton topological charge q for homogeneous
AT and GC chains are given in the Table III.

From Fig. 3 it becomes clear that the soliton energy ¯E
and its width D monotonously increase when the parameter
of cooperativity g increases. For soliton stability it is neces-
sary that its width D > 4.33. The view of stationary solitons
with the parameters of cooperativity g = 10 and g = 150
is presented in Fig. 4. In the case of the soliton with topo-
logical charge q=(1,0), the ﬁrst component has the form of a
smooth step (when n monotonously changes, the base of the

by smooth small amplitude deformation in the second compo-
nent (Fig. 4a). In the case of the soliton with q=(0,1), only
the second component has the form of a step (Fig. 4b). In the
case of soliton with q=(1,1), each of the components has the
form of a step (Fig. 4c), steps being displaced relatively one
another. Later on we shall show that this soliton is the bound
state of two topological solitons with the charges q1=(1,0) and
q2=(0,1). There exist two equivalent states of the soliton: the
left state q=(1,1)l, when the soliton with the charge q1 is on
left of the soliton with the charge q2 (Fig. 4c), and the right
state q=(1,1)r, when the soliton with the charge q1 is on right
of the soliton with the charge q2.

When ǫ = 6000 kJ/mol and K = 0.234 N/m the pa-
rameter of cooperativity g = 150.24 ≫ g0, and when
K = 0.8714 N/m the parameter g = 40.34 > g0 (see Ta-
ble III) for all types of topological solitons. So, for these val-
ues of the rigidity parameter K stable solitons with different
topological charges exist. For maximum value of the rigid-
ity parameter K = 4.744 N/m the parameter of cooperativity
g = 7.41 < g0, and this means that stable topological solitons
are absent. Thus the problem of the existence of topological
solitons (open states) in the DNA reduces to the problem of
receiving exact estimation of the parameters ǫ K. But this is,
however, a rather difﬁcult problem. We think that the values
ǫ = 6000 kJ/mol, K = 0.8714 N/m, when all three types of
solitons exist, are the most grounded. And we shall use these
values for further calculations.

Dependence of the energy E and the diameter D of sta-
tionary topological soliton on its topological charge q in the
chain with ǫ = 6000 kJ/mol and the transverse rigidity de-
termined by formulas (4) and (8), are given in the Table IV.
From the data of the table it follows that the energy of the
interaction of the solitons with the charges (1,0) and (0,1) is
equal to ∆E = E(1, 0) + E(0, 1) − E(1, 1) = 90.71 kJ/mol

Dependence of the soliton energy E and the diameter D on

Numerical investigation shows that all topological solitons
at all permitted velocities are stable. They move along the
chain with constant velocity, their form and energy being
conserved. Thus, the speciﬁcity of the chain of the DNA
molecule leads to a principal effect consisting in the possi-
bility of preferable localization of soliton excitations on one
chain. Moreover, it appears that soliton excitation with the
charge (1,1) is a bound state of two excitations localized in
separate chains.

INTERACTION OF TOPOLOGICAL SOLITONS

DNA is a rather long molecule, and several open states can
be activated in it simultaneously. Therefore it is interesting to
consider the problem of interaction of solitons imitating the
open states.

Numerical approach (13) permits us to investigate the prob-
lem and to obtain the dependence of the energy of a pair of
solitons with the charges q1, q2 on the distance between their
centers n1, n2. For the purpose, it is necessary to take the
boundary conditions and the initial point, which correspond
to a pair of topological solitons with the centers moving away
at a distance R. When minimizing the energy of the system
E = −L, it is necessary also to ﬁx the turns of the bases,
which correspond to the centers of solitons. Then the energy
of the obtained state E(R) corresponds to the energy of a
pair of topological solitons, the solitons being at a distance
R = n2 − n1 from each other. By changing positions of the
soliton centers, we can obtain the potential of interaction

Uq1,q2(R) = E(R) − E(q1) − E(q2) ,

where E(q1) and E(q2) is the energy of isolated solitons.

The potential of interaction of solitons of different types
and the potential of topological solitons with the charges of
the same sign are presented in Fig. 6. The potential of two
solitons of different types with q1 = (1, 0) and q2 = (0, 1)
has the form of symmetrical double well potential (Fig. 6,
curve 1). Maximum of the potential is reached when R = 0,
that is when the centers of the solitons are placed at the neigh-
boring chains and when the solitons are opposite to each other.
From energetic point of view this conﬁguration of the solitons
of different chains is the most disadvantageous. Minimum of
the energy is reached when R = ±20a. Thus two solitons of
this type can form two energetically equivalent coupled states.
One of the states (left minimum of the potential of interaction)
corresponds to the left isomer of the topological soliton with
the charge q= (1, 1)l, and the other state (the right minimum
of the potential of interaction) corresponds to the right isomer
of the soliton q = (1, 1)r.

If solitons have different signs of charges q1 = (1, 0) and

9

q2 = (0, −1), the potential of interaction has a bell-like form
with one maximum at R = 0 (Fig. 6, curve 2). From the
potential it follows that, the solitons which belong to different
chains, should repulse from each other. Solitons with the same
sign of charge (q1 = q2 = (1, 0), (0,1)) also repulse from
each other.

When distance between the solitons decreases, the energy
monotonically increases and goes to inﬁnity when R → 0
(Fig. 6, curve 3).

The potential of interaction Uq1,q2(R) permits to predict
the result of repulsion of solitons with the charges q1 and
q2. Let us model the repulsion of the solitons. For the pur-
pose, let us consider a double chain consisting of N = 4000
base pairs. At the ends of each of the polynucleotide chains
let us introduce viscous friction which provides with absorp-
tion of phonons. The system of equations of motion (5),
n = 1, 2, ..., N , was integrated numerically with the initial
condition which corresponds to two topological solitons with
the centers placed in the points n1 = N/4 and n2 = 3N/4
and with the velocities s1 = −s2 = s > 0.

The results show that collision of solitons having equal
signs q1 = q2 = (±1, 0), (0, ±1) leads to their reﬂection
at one another. When the velocities s are small, the reﬂection
is practically elastic, and when the velocities s are large, colli-
sion is accompanied by slight emission of phonons. Collision
of solitons with q1 = (±1, 0), q2 = (0, ∓1) and s = 0.5
leads to their reﬂection, accompanied by slight emission of
phonons. This behavior is in a good agreement with the form
of corresponding potential of interaction (Fig. 6, curve 2). To
pass through one another, solitons need to overcome energy
barrier Uq1,q2(0) = 2025 kJ/mol. Thus, their kinetic energy
should be equal to Ek(s) = Eq1 (s) + Eq2 (s) − Eq1(0) −
Eq2(0) > Uq1,q2(0). This condition is fulﬁlled only in the
vicinity of the most possible values of the velocity (see. Fig.
5). So, when s = 0.5, the kinetic energy Ek = 1732 kJ/mol
is lower than the height of the energy barrier (reﬂection takes
place), and when s = 0.6, the energy Ek = 3000.9 kJ/mol is
higher than the barrier (solitons pass through one another).

Solitons with the charges q1 = (±1, 0), q2 = (0, ±1) at-
tract one another at a distance R > 20a, and when the dis-
tance is shorter they repulse one another. Here the energy
barrier Uq1,q2(0) = 4989 kJ/mol does not permit solitons to
pass through one another. Solitons always reﬂect. Formation
of the bound state does not occur even when the value of the
velocity is small. It is explained by small value of the bond
energy ∆E = 91 kJ/mol.

Potential of interaction of different topological solitons
with the charges of opposite signs (q1 = −q2) is presented
in Fig. 7. Potential of interaction of one component solitons
(q1 = (1, 0), (0, 1)) monotonically decreases with the de-
creasing of the distance between the solitons. When R → 0,
the potential Uq1,q2(R) → −[E(q1) + E(q2)]. At a distance
R = 0 solitons completely recombine.

Potential of interaction of two component solitons with the
charges of different signs has a similar form. If the solitons
have different polarity, that is, if the ﬁrst soliton is a left isomer
(q1 = (1, 1)l) and the second soliton is a right isomer (q2 =
(−1, −1)r). Solitons of that type attract one another. Their

collisions always leads to recombination of the solitons.

If solitons have the same polarity, they repulse when R >
20a, and attract when the distances are shorter. Recombi-
nation of the solitons requires overcoming the energy bar-
rier 1730 kJ/mol. Solitons overcome the barrier only when
s > 0.38, and the value of their kinetic energy is more than the
height of the barrier. When the value of the velocity is smaller,
solitons reﬂect, and when the value is larger they recombine
(Fig. 8). During recombination the energy of solitons is spent
for intensive emission of phonons. Breather-like excitations
can be also formed.

Collision of one component soliton with two component
soliton can lead (depending on the relationship of the signs
of charges and on the polarity of the two component soliton)
to their partial recombination or to inelastic reﬂection accom-
panied by disintegration of the two component soliton. So,
at the velocity s = 0.5 collision of the soliton having the
charge q1 = (1, 0), with the two component soliton having
the charge q2 = (1, 1)l, leads to inelastic reﬂection of the ﬁrst
soliton, and at the same time the second soliton disintegrates
into two one component solitons with the charges (1,0) and
(0,1) (Fig. 9).

VII. EFFECT OF THE CHAIN INHOMOGENEITIES ON
THE DYNAMICS OF TOPOLOGICAL SOLITONS

Till now our investigation was limited by consideration of
homogeneous model of DNA. The real DNA is, however, a
substantially inhomogeneous system, therefore it is of special
interest to consider the effect of the chain inhomogeneity on
the dynamics of topological solitons. In the inhomogeneous
chain, the energy of stationary soliton E will depend on the
position of the center of the soliton ¯n. To move, soliton re-
quires to overcome the energetic potential barrier E(¯n). To
ﬁnd the energy of the soliton with the center at the point n = ¯n
we need to solve numerically the problem of minimizing

αβn – the sequence of the base pairs along the chain. The
boundary conditions (17), (18) are the same as those in the
problem (13). To ﬁx the soliton center position we need to
solve the problem of minimizing (16) with respect to variables
ϕn,i where 2 ≤ n ≤ N − 1, n 6= ¯n, i = 1, 2. For soliton with
charge q1 6= 0 it is necessary to ﬁx the value ϕ¯n,1 = πq1, and
for soliton with q2 6= 0 – the value ϕ¯n,2 = πq2.

The problem on conditional minimum (16) has been solved
by the numerical method of conjugate gradient. We took N =
2000. Possible view of energetic proﬁle of the soliton moving
in the inhomogeneous chain is presented in Fig. 10

At the beginning, let us estimate the effect of point inhomo-
geneities. From Fig. 10a it is obvious that one point defect in
the homogeneous AT chain leads to appearance of localized
potential barrier with height equal to Ed = 150 kJ/mol. To
overcome the barrier, the soliton kinetic energy should satisfy

to point defects.

In the chain one part of which consists of only AT base
pairs, and the other – of only GC base pairs energetic bar-
rier takes the form of smooth step (Fig. 10c). The height of
the step is equal to the difference between the values of soli-
ton energy in homogeneous GC and AT chains. From data
of table IV it follows, that the height of the step is equal
to ∆E = 1065 kJ/mol for soliton with topological charge
q=(1,0) and ∆E = 844 kJ/mol for soliton with q=(0,1), and
when q=(1,1) the energy ∆E=1894 kJ/mol. Soliton moving
along homogeneous AT region of the chain, can enter into
GC region only if its kinetic energy Ek(s) > ∆E. As seen
from Fig. 5, this condition is satisﬁed only if soliton veloc-
ity s > sk, where the threshold value of the velocity is de-
termined by the equation Ek(sk) = ∆E. For soliton with
q=(1,0) the velocity sk = 0.48, for q=(0,1) sk = 0.59, and
for q=(1,1) the velocity sk = 0.52.

Let us model numerically the soliton moving from homo-
geneous AT region of the chain to homogeneous GC region.
The results of the modeling show that the soliton with veloc-

the condition Ek(s) = E(s) − E(0) > Ed. Soliton can to
overcome the barrier only when its velocity s > sd, where
the threshold value of the velocity sd is taken from equation
E(sd) − E(0) = Ed. From the data of Fig. 5 it is easy to
ﬁnd, that for soliton with q=(1,0) the velocity sd = 0.21, for
soliton with q=(0,1) the velocity sd = 0.28, and when q=(1,1)
the velocity sd = 0.17.

Let us model numerically the interaction of soliton with lo-
cal defect of the homogeneous AT chain. For the purpose, let
us consider homogeneous AT chain consisting of N = 4000
bases with one base GC in the middle of the chain in the point
n = N/2. Suggest that at the initial time a topological soliton
is in the point n = N/4 and consider its movement through
the chain inhomogeneity. The results of numerical modeling
of the soliton dynamics show, that independently on the value
of topological charge q soliton with velocity s = 0.05 reﬂect
from this point defect, but for s = 0.5, moves through the
point defect with negligibly small energy loss.

Point defect in the homogeneous GC chain leads to forma-
tion of localized potential well with depth 150 kJ/mol (see
Fig. 10b). Almost at all values of the velocity soliton easily
propagates along this chain without formation of bound state.
Thus we can conclude that soliton moving in the DNA chain
with sufﬁciently large velocity (s > sd) is stable with respect

FIG. 11: Movement of soliton with q= (1, 0), s = 0.5 through the
boundary between homogeneous AT and GC regions.

ity s = 0.05 < sk and with any topological charge reﬂects
elastically from the boundary between the regions. At given
velocity the soliton kinetic energy is not large enough to over-
come energetic barrier (Ek(s) ≪ ∆E). Soliton with s = 0.5
q = (1, 0) moves through the boundary between homoge-
neous regions and its motion is accompanied by emission of
phonons. Inside the region consisting of GC base pairs, soli-
ton continues to move, but with a smaller magnitude of the
velocity (Fig. 11). For given value of q the threshold value of
the velocity sk = 0.48 < 0.5. So, the kinetic energy of soli-
ton is large enough to overcome energetic barrier. Because
the main part of the kinetic energy is spent to overcome the
barrier, the velocity of the soliton substantially decreases after
overcoming the barrier. When q=(0,1) the threshold value of
the velocity sk = 0.59 and soliton reﬂects at s = 0.5 from the
boundary of the homogeneous regions. The reﬂection is ac-
companied by phonon emission. For soliton with the charge
q=(1,1) the velocity s = 0.5 < sk = 0.52 is not enough to
overcome energetic barrier. Collision of soliton having topo-
logical charge (q = (1, 1)l) with the boundary between the
homogeneous regions leads to the disintegration of the soli-
ton. It disintegrates into two one component solitons with the
charges q1 = (1, 0) and q2 = (0, 1). Soliton with the charge
q2 continues to move into GC region of the chain, and soliton

with the charge q1 reﬂects from the boundary.

Let us consider the propagation of soliton in the inhomo-
geneous chain with random sequence of bases. In this case
random energetic relief E(n) is formed. The amplitude of the
relief for soliton with q=(1,0) reaches 1000 kJ/mol, and for
soliton with q=(1,1) – 1500 kJ/mol (Fig. 10d). It is obvious
that uniform propagation of soliton in the chain of that type
is impossible, because soliton loses part of energy for phonon
emission when crossing each homogeneity.

Let us consider the movement of soliton through inhomo-
geneous region of the chain. For the purpose, let us suggest
that the second part of the chain is formed by a random equal-
possible sequence of base pairs AT, TA, CG, GC. The results
of numerical modeling of the soliton dynamics show that soli-
ton with small value of the velocity s = 0.05 and with any
topological charge reﬂects from the boundary of the inhomo-
geneous region. This points out, that penetration of the soli-
ton into the inhomogeneous region requires the overcoming
of some energy barrier. Soliton with larger velocity s = 0.5
and charge q= (1, 0) overcomes this barrier, enters the disor-
dered region of the chain and stops there. The movement in
the disordered region is accompanied by intensive emission of
phonons, which leads to the stop of the soliton. Soliton with
q=(0, 1) can not overcome the barrier even at this value of the

velocity. The soliton reﬂects from the boundary of the inho-
mogeneous region. The reﬂection is accompanied by emis-
sion of phonons. Two component soliton with q= (1, 1)l
enters inhomogeneous region, and at the same time it dis-
integrates into two one component solitons with the charges
q1 = (1, 0) and q2 = (0, 1). The solitons moves some time in
the inhomogeneous chain, then they stop (Fig. 12). The path
of the solitons can reach several hundred base pairs.

Analogous results have been obtained even in the case when
inhomogeneous region was formed by the base pairs AT and
TA. Thus, the sequence of nitrous bases of DNA molecule
should substantially inﬂuence the characteristics of the motion
of topological soliton. Note, that it has been pointed out ﬁrstly
in the work [25].

INTERACTION OF TOPOLOGICAL SOLITONS

WITH THERMAL OSCILLATIONS OF THE CHAIN

Dynamics of a thermalized chain consisting of N sites, is

described by the system of the Langevin equations

where the Hamiltonian of the system H is given by Eq. (1),
ξn,i are random normally distributed forces describing the in-
teraction of the n-th base of the i-th chain (i = 1, 2) with
thermal bath, Γ = 1/tr is the coefﬁcient of friction, tr being
the relaxation time of the rotation velocity of one base. The
random forces ξn,i have normal distribution and the correla-
tion functions are

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the temperature of
thermal bath.

The system (19) was integrated numerically by the standard
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with constant step of inte-
gration ∆t. The delta function was represented as δ(t) = 0
when |t| > ∆t/2, and δ(t) = 1/∆t when |t| ≤ ∆t/2, i.e., the
step of numerical integration corresponded to the correlation
time of the random force. In order to use the Langevin equa-
tion, it was necessary to suggest that ∆t ≪ tr. Therefore we
chose ∆t = 0.001 ps and the relaxation time tr ≥ 1 ps.

Let us check stability of topological soliton with respect
to thermal oscillations of the chain. For the purpose, let
us consider homogeneous periodical AT chain consisting of
N = 4000 base pairs at the temperature T = 300K. Let us
integrate system (19) with the initial condition corresponding
to topological soliton (s = 0.5) with center placed in the point
n = N/4. Numerical integration shows stability of solitons
at all values of the charge and at both values of the transverse
rigidity K = 0.234 N/m and K = 0.8714 N/m. The viscos-
ity of the environment leads to quick stop of the soliton, and

after that all time it remains immovable. Soliton remains sta-
ble with respect to thermal oscillations during the all time of
numerical integration t = 5 × 103 ps (Fig. 13).

Let us note that in contrast to the models of phi-4 and of
sine-Gordon the stability of solitons in the DNA model has not
topological nature. Solitons can be destroyed. To show this, it
is enough to suggest that the soliton width is equal to one base
pair (soliton of that type is equivalent to the ground state of the
chain). Here the stability is associated with energetic factors.
From Fig. 13 it is well seen that in the region of localization of
the soliton, the density of the energy is equal to En ≫ kBT .
Soliton path length in the thermalized homogeneous chain
(T = 300K) depends on the value of relaxation time tr (on

the viscosity of the surrounding of the molecule). At strong
viscosity tr = 1 ps soliton has time to pass only 7 chain links
till full stop. Then it remains immovable all the time (Fig. 13).
When the viscosity is lower tr = 10 ps soliton has time to pass
41 links, and when tr = 100 ps – 480 links. The braking of
soliton at low viscosity (tr = 1000 ps) is shown in Fig. 14.
Soliton passes more than 3000 chain links, and then it begins
to move as a massive Brownian particle.

The braking of soliton in the homogeneous chain is con-
ditioned only by viscosity. When the viscosity is absent
(tr = ∞) soliton is moving along thermalized chain with
constant velocity (Fig. 15).Thetmal phonons by themselves
do not inﬂuence the soliton dynamics.

Let us note that topological soliton can move along the
DNA chain in the presence of viscosity too. To organize the
propagation it is necessary to select in a special way the se-
quence of bases. If concentration of AT base pairs monotoni-
cally increases, inclined potential E(n) is formed. The energy

overfall can reach 1116 kJ/mol at K = 0.234 N/m and 1894
kJ/mol at K = 0.8714 N/m. Soliton will propagate along the
relief inclination as a Brownian particle moving in the viscous
media under the action of external constant force.

Thermal phonons substantially inﬂuence the interaction of
solitons. In the work [42], it was shown that topological soli-
tons of the model φ–4, can interact with one another through
thermal phonons. This interaction comes to repulsion of the
solitons. As a result, in the thermalized chain the interaction
of the solitons of different charges substantially changes. At
a long distance they will repulse. To model this phenomenon,
let us consider collision of solitons with different charges and
polarities in the thermalized cyclic AT chain (q1 = (1, 1)l,
q2 = (−1, −1)r, s1 = −s2 = 0.5). In the nonthermalized
chain (T = 0K), the solitons attract one another, and the col-
lision leads to their recombination. In the thermalized cyclic
chain (T = 300K), their collision always leads to reﬂection

15

phonons gas between solitons when they are drawing together.
The compression leads to the repulsion of solitons, which in-
creases as far as they are drawing together. In the chain with
free ends, the compression of the phonon gas leads to long
range repulsion of the solitons from the ends of the chain.

Thus, topological solitons of the DNA chains are stable
with respect to thermal oscillations. Interaction with thermal
phonons does not lead to destruction or to the braking of the
soliton, it leads only to changing the interaction between the
solitons. In the thermalized chain, long range repulsion be-
tween solitons is appeared.

IX. CONCLUSION

Investigation carried out in this paper shows that three types
of topological solitons which imitate localized states with
open base pairs, can exist in the considered asymmetrical
model of the DNA double chain. It was shown that the soli-
tons can move along the macromolecule with constant veloc-
ity which is smaller than the sound velocity. In the inhomo-
geneous chain, the character of the soliton movement depends
on the sequence of base pairs in the molecule. In the chain
with random inhomogeneous sequence, solitons can move at
a distance no more than several hundreds of base pairs. The
results of numerical investigations show that the solitons are
stable with respect to thermal oscillations. Interaction of the
solitons with thermal phonons of the macromolecule does not
lead to destruction or to the braking of the solitons. And only
the character of their interactions changes. The drawing of the
solitons together leads to their repulsion, which is explained
by compression of phonon gas between them.

All these results point out that topological solitons of this
type can be used to explain the long range effects in the DNA
macromolecule.

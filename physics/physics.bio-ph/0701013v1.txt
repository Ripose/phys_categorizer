The eﬀect of electric ﬁelds on lipid membranes

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Contrary to existing theoretical models, experimental evidence points out that electroporation
(membrane defect formation under external electric ﬁelds) starts to occur within the range of trans-
membrane voltages that cells may routinely experience, curiously, just above the range of trans-
membrane voltages involved in neural signal transmission. Understanding the underlying principles
of electric ﬁelds-lipid membrane interactions seems to carry a great biological importance.

An argument is presented toward understanding the theoretical aspects of electroporation by
using the DLVO theory, which has not been recognized previously in the context of electroporation.
Further, the dispersion interactions (with its quantum nature), of the double layer counterions and
membrane lipid molecules over the Stern layer are emphasized. The sign of these forces is such that
they compress the membrane. A parallel is drawn to the theory of thin ﬁlms. The argument is that
the external electric ﬁeld breaks the symmetry of the disjoining pressures on both sides of a lipid
membrane, resulting in a protrusion of only few lipid molecules. That compromises the membrane
stability on a nanoscale and makes it traversable to ions. The presented estimate based on these
arguments is consistent to electroporation experiments and existing numerical simulations.

INTRODUCTION

A. Electroporation

Foam ﬁlms and membranes have been studied for over
100 years. They are a bilayer formation with or without
an aqueous core respectively, in which the hydrophilic
groups are facing the aqueous solution.
In the case of
membranes the hydrophobic ends are in opposite direc-
tion facing each other, and in the case of foam ﬁlms,
soap bubbles, for example, the hydrophobic ends are ex-
posed to air.
In both, foam ﬁlms (soap lamellas) and
double layer membranes (lipid membranes), an equilib-
rium on the order of molecular dimension thickness (nm)
can be reached, creating black ﬁlms and membranes [1].
The biomembranes play a vital role in the activities of
organelles and cells, and they are very closely related
to this group of bilayer formations. Their main function
varies, but one of the essential roles is to provide an excel-
lent barrier, allow a very complex and selective molecular
signaling and transport, including propagation of neural
signals.

Beside diverse composition and thickness of the bilayer
and its exposition to air or aqueous medium, they all
exhibit more or less elastic stability. Under mechanical
or electrical stress they rupture (lyse) and in some
occasions they may exhibit reversibility of the defects
(reversible breakdown). The reversible breakdown has
been observed in the case of soap ﬁlms exposed to elec-
tric ﬁelds for example [2] and is a more common feature
of lipid membrane electroporation. This indicates an
underlying mechanism how these disperse systems can
be analyzed and described.

The electrical breakdown and reversible breakdown of
biological membranes has been subject of intensive exper-
imental and theoretical studies. However, the eﬀects the
electric ﬁelds have on membranes, and the actual mech-
anism of electrically induced instabilities is still not sat-
isfactory understood. Some models are concerned with
more macroscopic reasons for instability as lipid mem-
brane thinning, related to electrostriction , undulation
and elastic properties of the membranes [3, 4, 5, 6]. Other
models, as electroporation models, ﬁnd the explanation
in formation and expansion of tiny pores. This process
of electrically creating aqueous pores in the membrane,
large enough to be traversable to ions and molecules is
termed electroporation. The eﬀect is believed to be in-
trinsic to artiﬁcial planar bilayer membranes, as well as
to any other biological membrane of a cell or an organelle.
Thus, the electroporation process may strongly increases
the ionic and molecular transport across a biologically
relevant membranes, redistribute membrane’s lipid con-
tent and cause many biologically signiﬁcant eﬀects.

The process of electroporation has been routinely used
in cell biology to load cells with small molecules (drugs),
and large molecules (as proteins and DNA) [7].

Experimental evidence over many decades [8] sug-
gested that the electroporation process is a stochastic
process, with pore size evolution and occurrence of re-
versible or irreversible breakdown [9, 10]. It is believed
that the pores completely dominate electrical conduc-
tance, but they occupy very small fractional area.

Bilipid membrane thickness is much smaller than the
wavelength of light so the process of electroporation is
most commonly observed through change of electrical
conductance of the membrane (believed as a result of
electrically induced pores). Recent accurate measure-

ments [11] have recorded a change in conductance due
to a single defect (pore) at transmembrane voltages as
250 mV. The pore size estimates based on the
little as
change in conductance indicate a nanometer size defects,
and a lifetime in the range of milliseconds.

≈

The theoretical models of electroporation are roughly
concerned with two distinct aspects, the theory of pore
creation and the theory of pore evolution.

The pore evolution concepts have roots [12, 13, 14] in
the work of J.B. Zeldovich, from 1943. Based on exper-
iments and theoretical analysis, the Chizmadzhev group
in 1979, has described the initial electroporation theory
for artiﬁcial planar bilayer membranes in a set of seven
papers [9]. The use of Smoluchowski equation in the con-
text of pore size evolution was given by [9, 15].

While the pore evolution and expansion models seem
to be well established, the initial steps of pore formation
are less certain. A central part of almost all electro-
poration models is the critical permealization threshold
needed for pore creation. A phenomenological, Arrhenius
like model of transmembrane voltage dependent energy
barrier was independently proposed by [16, 17]. More
recent electroporation simulations [18, 19] use diﬀerent
pore evolution concepts, but a common Arrhenius en-
50 kT for pore creation [20], which
ergy barrier of
is in agreement with the experimental values of critical
voltages causing electroporation. The existing theoretical
models, related to membrane elasticity, seem to predict
critical voltages of several Volts causing membrane in-
stability. That exceeds the experimental lower threshold
values (
250 mV - 1 V) by far. Model modiﬁcations
have been proposed [21] to avoid this discrepancy, but
it seems that mechanism of membrane’s electrical break-
down is still not satisfactory understood.

≈

Besides all this advances, it seems that many questions
related to the physical mechanisms of the electroporation
are still not well understood [22], and more basic research
is needed.

Based on the accumulated experimental observation
and the recent measurements, speciﬁcally,
[11], and
molecular dynamics simulations [23], a few main elec-
troporation aspects, relevant for this paper, can be
summarized.

≈

- Relatively low transmembrane voltages of

200 mV

can cause electroporation.
- Poration is a local eﬀect (just few lipids involved).
- Pores are nanometer size defects.
- It takes a short time (ns) to create a pore.
- It takes a long time (ms) to destroy a pore.
- The process is sensitive to concentration and pH.
- The process causes electroporation asymmetry and
lipid redistribution on the cell membrane (ﬂip-ﬂop).

This paper, further mainly addresses the theoretical
aspects of pore creation. The other aspects of the elec-
troporation will be addressed in a future work.

To put all this into context, a few basic aspects of lipid

membranes and mean ﬁeld theories of ion interactions
with membranes, are brieﬂy noted.

B. General about lipid membranes

1. Lipid membrane ﬂuctuations

Based on spectroscopic data a time scale for reorien-
tation of chemical bonds, molecular segments, molecules,
or assemblies of molecules can be placed. In general, the
correlation time increases with increasing size of moving
segments. The time scale of lipid motion in biomem-
branes and their approximate correlation times cover al-
most 15 orders of magnitude [24]. Protrusion, the head
groups sticking in or out of the membrane plane is on
the order of 10−9 s. Rotational diﬀusion of the head
group or wobble is on a scale of 10−8 s. The lateral dif-
fusion (in the plane of the membrane) is on the order of
10−12 to 10−11
10−7 s, with a diﬀusion constant of D
≈
m2/s, and lipids spanning distances of
10µm in 1 s.
The large scale collective deformations (curvatures) from
the plane of the membrane - undulations are on a time
scale of 10−6 s to 1 s. They are thermally driven, and
membrane’s waves like motions correspond to very large
wavelengths. Finally the jumps of lipids from one side
on the membrane to the other or the so called ﬂip-fop is
dependent on molecule’s polarity, and is on the order of
103 s to 104 s.

≈

2. The pressure proﬁle in lipid membranes

Protrusion of the lipid molecules is closely related to
the lateral pressure proﬁle. Most of the biologically rele-
vant lipid bilayer membranes are made of lipid molecules
with two hydrocarbon chains [25]. The lateral pressure
proﬁle of these lipid bilayer membranes is symmetric with
respect to the middle of the membrane. Going towards
the middle of the bilayer [25], there is initially headgroup
repulsion, and then interfacial attraction. Coming to-
wards the two hydrocarbon chains, repulsion is encoun-
tered again, since hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails dislike
each other’s presence. All of these pressures are summed
up to zero.

The value of these pressures is high. Various molecu-
lar dynamics simulations [26, 27, 28, 29] indicate values
in the range of hundreds of atmospheres. A simulation
estimate using lattice statistical thermodynamic calcula-
tions of lateral pressure proﬁles [30] give a value of over
400atm. A lower threshold value of
400atm will be
used throughout this paper as a approximate threshold
of membrane instability.

≈

Molecular dynamics simulations of electroporation [23]
also indicate high values of pressures. The forces of tens
0.6 nm2)[25],
of pN on the area of a lipid headgroup (
result in fairly large pressures of few hundred atmo-
spheres.

II. DLVO THEORY AND MEMBRANES

The surface charge density of lipid membranes mainly
comes from the lipid head groups that are exposed to the
aqueous solution. The electric ﬁeld of this surface charge
redistributes the ions in the electrolyte due to the local
concentration (n) and potential (ψ) gradients that can
be described according to the familiar equation

An important contribution to the problem of stability
of thin ﬁlms was given by the works that started 60 to 70
years ago by Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek
(DLVO theory). The behavior of the system of electrolyte
column sandwiched between any two surfaces is a conse-
quence of the interplay between repulsive and attractive
(van der Waals) forces on the interface. The balance of
these forces and the thickness of the ﬁlm correspond to
an interaction energy minimum.

In 1939, Derjaguin originally formulated the concept
of a disjoining pressure for thin liquid ﬁlms and veriﬁed
experimentally its existence [13] [12]. Changes in the
interfacial region that generate the disjoining pressure in
a thin liquid ﬁlm originate from intermolecular forces. It
is customary to separate the various contributions of the
disjoining pressure into diﬀerent components, e.g.,

ρ (x) =

The expression in the brackets (pressure) shows that
the entropy of mixing (the osmotic pressure) of the elec-
trolyte is inﬂuenced by the electric ﬁeld from the mem-
brane surface charges. As a result, entropically unfavor-
able, counterions are more densely distributed against
the membrane, but in such a way that the total pres-
sure is constant in any transverse cross section from
the membrane. The expression (4) is dependent on the
ion concentration, and by applying an additional electric
ﬁeld, there will be ion redistribution. It should be men-
tioned [13] that it is not necessary to resort to Poisson-
Boltzmann equation and any assumptions leading to it,
to obtain expression (4). In most general case we would

where the ﬁrst two, the electrostatic (Πe) and the
dispersion (Πw) component, usually refer to DLVO
theory. The other components as steric, short range
structural forces, and adhesion forces play important
role at molecular distances. The key assumption of
equation (6) is that the various contributions to the dis-
joining pressure are additive. However, it is not always
clear that this assumption is valid and it may lead, in
some cases, to anomalous results. In general, thin ﬁlm
stability is inﬂuenced most importantly, by the electro-
static (Πe) and the dispersion (Πw) components [13] [12].

Further the disjoining pressure components of a single
lipid membrane in solution are analyzed, by considering
the case when one of the ﬁlms is moved far away.

A. The electrostatic component of disjoining
pressure Πe

DLVO describes the interaction pressure of thin ﬁlms.
There the diﬀuse layers of the two charged surfaces over-
lap, and cause interaction pressure between them. The
hydrostatic pressure at some distance x from the mem-
brane is given by the constant term in equation (5). The
diﬀerence of the hydrostatic pressures in the bulk (ab-
sence of the other surface) and in the interlayer is the
electrostatic component of the disjoining pressure Πe [13]
[12].

Πe = PD(x)

P∞(x).

−
Here PD(x) is the pressure at point x in the interlayer
when the two surfaces are 2D apart, and P∞(x) is the
pressure at the same point x when the two surfaces are
separated.

(7)

If the overlapping diﬀuse layers are identical, there is
a symmetry plane at x = D where ψ = ψm and E = 0.
Considering the anions and cations, in a 1 : 1 electrolyte
such as N aCl or KCl, and a Gouy-Chapman ρ(ψ), the
disjoining pressure from equation (7) will have a cosine
hyperbolic dependence on the midplane voltage ψm,

The pressure is directed towards the membrane.
Further, in this paper, arguments are presented that
the expression (9) should be used to describe the inter-
action of external electric ﬁelds with a lipid membrane
in electroporation models and theory. The argument for
this follows the analogy that the presence of electrode’s
electric ﬁelds has a similar eﬀect as another charged sur-
face being present far away.

B. The dispersion component of disjoining
pressure Πw

The van der Waals dispersion forces are caused by po-
larization due to ﬂuctuating electromagnetic ﬁelds. Be-
sides being dependent on geometry, they are also fre-
quency dependent, and they relate to the refractive index
and dispersion.

It can be shown, for example [32, 33] that van der
Waals interaction of two neutral polarizable particles
can be attributed to correlations in the ﬂuctuating
vacuum electromagnetic ﬁeld, that induces ﬂuctuating
dipole moments in the particles, and the correlation of
these moments is the der Waals interaction. The van
der Waals interactions can be derived from the Maxwell
equations and the additional (quantum) assumption that
each mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld has a zero-point
energy 1
2

~ω.

Calculating the dispersion forces, even for simple
geometry,
is not an easy task and few aspects like
nonadditivity, relativistic retardation and the sign need
to be addressed.

In rariﬁed media like a gas or a solute in a solution,
non-pair wise interactions are small and additivity holds,
but in condensed media, the dispersion forces are not

4

additive, and in general, the force between two molecules
depends on the presence of other molecules. These
non-pair wise interaction energies may be attractive or
repulsive, depending on the geometrical arrangement
of the particles involved, and are important to be
considered if the intermolecular spacing is small. The
Lifshitz formula and theory [12, 13, 32] used here to
calculate the Maxwell stress tensor is macroscopic, and
avoids the problems associated with non-additivity of
the dispersion forces.

When the intermolecular spacing is large, the rel-
ativistic retardation, due to the ﬁnite speed of light,
needs to be included. This aspect plays an important
role in colloidal systems and reduces the strength of
In the limiting case of
van der Waals interaction [34].
perfect conductor,
including retardation, the Lifshitz
formula reduces to the Casimir force, which is a macro-
scopic manifestation of the van der Waals force.
In
either of these cases van der Waals interactions may be
regarded as a consequence of the ﬂuctuating vacuum
electromagnetic ﬁeld [32, 33]. For the distance between
the interacting objects considered in this paper, the
relativistic retardation can be ignored.

Regarding the sign of the dispersion forces, they can be
positive or negative depending on the situation and the
geometry. Form the de Boer-Hamaker theorem [13, 35],
it follows that the van der Waals forces between two par-
ticles of ﬁxed shape and of the same material embedded
in a ﬂuid is always attractive. If particles have diﬀerent
composition, the resulting force can be repulsion. This
is because in the interaction between the two bodies, an
interaction of ﬂuid bodies of same size has to be included.

Considering all this, an expression and the sign for
the dispersion component of the disjoining pressure Πw
in the context of electroporation, is further presented.
This expression is given for a solute particles and a
substrate, both in medium. The assumption is that the
ﬂuctuating electric ﬁeld in a dilute solution or gas, acts
on each dilute species without distortion of the ﬁeld
by other solute or gas molecules. For such media the
Lorentz-Lorenz corrections are unimportant, the Lifshitz
formula can be simpliﬁed, and ǫ of the dilute-solution
(dilute-gas) limit has the dielectric response strictly
proportional to the number of solute (gas) molecules
[12, 32, 36].

The interaction energy of one particle (ǫs) of radius a,
at a distance d away from a substrate (ǫhc) over a medium
(ǫw) is given as [36]

For the dispersion part of equation (10), due to the
fact that the electronic polarizabilities are dominant, the
typical absorption frequencies ξ are close to the UV re-
gion. Then the pre factor kT and the sum over discrete
frequencies in equation (10), are replaced by ~ and an in-
tegral over them [25], thus revealing the quantum nature
of equation (11) and the role played by the zero-point en-
ergy. Calculating the integral in equation (11), requires
the functions ǫ(iξ), to be known. Unfortunately, com-
plete data of the absorption spectra of most materials
are not available. An estimate of the integral is given in
the Appendix.

From equation (11) it can be seen that the sign of the
pressure Πw is determined by the dielectric permittivi-
ties for given frequency. The particles will be attracted
towards the substrate if ǫs > ǫw and ǫhc > ǫw.

From equation (4), noting that at the surface Es =

mid-plane (where E = 0) is very useful, but this is not
applicable in the case of a single membrane.

1. Numerical simulation

5

≈

A coupled simulation of equations (1) and (3) over
time of 1 µs and simulation space of 0.25µm was done.
The bulk ion concentration was considered to be 100mM
which corresponds to Debye length of
1nm. Micro-
scopic details on the membrane were not considered. It
was taken to be a 5nm thick dielectric slab with dielec-
tric constant of ǫ = 2. On both sides of the membrane
a Stern layer of thickness 1.8nm, approximately the size
of a water molecule [25], not accessible to diﬀusing ions,
was considered. The dielectric constant in the Stern layer
was taken to be the same as the one in the water, ǫ = 80.
The analytical expressions (12) and (13) were used in the
simulation of equations (1) and (3) to ﬁnd ψ (x) and from
it, the initial ion distribution ρ (x) near the membrane.
This initial ion distribution was used later in the case
when an external electric ﬁeld was applied.

The simulation gives a nice agreement and compara-
ble results to Gouy-Chapman theory (high potentials),
and the Debye-H¨uckel theory (low potentials). Under an
external electric ﬁled there is an ion concentration stabi-
lization near the membrane within the membrane charg-
1µs. This also corresponds to the standard
ing time of
−2. The
membrane speciﬁc capacitance of cm = 1µFcm
analytical estimate of the ion concentration change based
on the speciﬁc capacitance equation (16) gives a value of
14.4mM for each increase in the applied voltage of
∆n
∆ψm = 50mV. For the run time of the simulation (1µs)
the ion concentration change was ∆n

11mM.

The type of ions, the bulk ion concentration, and the
applied voltages used in the simulation were chosen to
resemble the experimental situation of [11]. Besides the
agreement, the data from the simulation was used just to
illustrate the voltage proﬁle near the membrane in ﬁgure
(2).
In all other estimates, standard analytical values
were used.

B. Estimate of the gradient of the disjoining
pressures

1. The gradient of the electrostatic component of disjoining
pressure ∆Πe

The electrostatic component of this pressure gradient
over the membrane can be calculated using equation (9),
where ψm is the value of the potential far away from
the membrane. The applied electric ﬁeld manifests it-
self by establishing ∆ψm across the membrane without
substantially aﬀecting the side potentials [37] near the
membrane. The side potentials ψs depend heavily on
membranes surface charge and ψs2 = ψs1+∆ψm as shown
in ﬁgure (2). Then relative to the left side potential, the
diﬀerence in the electrostatic component of the disjoining
pressure on both sides of the membrane is

where ∆ψm is the transmembrane voltage. This ex-
pression has not been used yet in the electroporation
models and theory. Besides its voltage dependence, away
from the membrane, it also reveals its bulk ion concen-
tration dependence that is often missing in the electro-
poration models.

In electroporation experiments [11], it has been noticed
that relatively small transmembrane voltage of few hun-
dred mV cause electroporation, in contrast to membrane
elasticity model estimates of few volts. The expression
300 mV gives ∆Πe over the

membrane instability threshold of
400 atm. The cal-
culated values of ∆Πe are shown in ﬁgure (1).

2. The gradient of the dispersion component of disjoining
pressure ∆Πw

Similar to ∆Πe, due to the externally applied ﬁeld,
the asymmetry in the number of ions on both sides of
the membrane (nleft = neq + ∆n and nright = neq −
∆n), will also cause a pressure gradient in the dispersion
component Πw. As indicated from equation (11) van der
Waals dispersion force is proportional to the hydrated
ion concentration n(d), in a segment ∆x of unit area,
parallel to the membrane. The dispersion force between
the ions and the membrane hydrocarbons will give rise
to pressure gradient ∆Πw due to the diﬀerence in the
number of ions on both sides of the membrane.

∆n is proportional with the accumulated charge and
an estimate of ∆n that goes into equation (15) can be

14.4 mM, corresponding to ψm = 250 mV we will have
a value for the lower limit of ∆Πw = 113 atm (146 atm
for Na+ ions). The values for Πw (for ψm = 250 mV) are
comparable to Πe, and their sum is in the range of the
400 atm. Estimates
membrane instability threshold of
for wider range of transmembrane voltages are shown in
ﬁgure (1).

≈

From equation (15) it can be seen that the contribution

to Πw of ions at larger distances diminishes rapidly.

C. General Electroporation Conclusions

Based on the DLVO approach, the main electropora-
tion aspects now can be interpreted, and few conclusions
can be drawn.

≈

It is been experimentally noticed [11] that relatively
250mV) of the transmembrane voltage
small values (
cause electroporation, which has not been satisfactory
explained yet. Arguments using standard DLVO theory
(equations (14) and (15)) were presented here, that indi-
cate how a relatively low transmembrane voltage results
in large disjoining pressures (hundreds of atmospheres)
on the membrane eventually causing electroporation.

Based on membrane’s electrical conductivity during
electroporation, experimental evidence strongly suggests
the existence of nanometer size defects. This makes elec-
troporation a local eﬀect that involves rearrangement of
only few lipid headgroups. The timescale for creation of
these defects is of the order of nanoseconds. The only
lipid membrane ﬂuctuations of this spatial and temporal
scale are the protrusions. This suggests that the dis-
joining pressure is aﬀecting the protrusion of the lipid
headgroups, and is working against their lateral pressure
proﬁle. This also suggests that the external electric ﬁeld
compromising the membrane’s stability can be localized
too.

It takes a short time to create a pore. In contrast it
takes a long time for pore destruction (pore lifetime is
ms [11]). DLVO gives an insight why this might be
≈
the case. Once a nanometer size pore is ﬁled with wa-
ter, it resembles more the situation of thin ﬁlms with
overlapping interfacial regions. Van der Waals forces re-
verse sign for this situation and prevent the closing of
the pore on nanosecond timescale due to double layer and
hydration repulsion, which in the case of thin ﬁlms, dom-
inate phospholipid membranes as they approach within
0.1 to 0.3nm. The interfacial regions of these double lay-
ers would depend on the geometrical shape of the pore,
which at present is not known and is usually modeled as
cylindrical or toroidal. Ion concentration inside the pore
will also be diﬀerent from the bulk concentration.

FIG. 1: Analytical estimates of the electrostatic and dispersion components of the disjoining pressure. Equation (14) and
(15) were used. The increase of the number of ions with the transmembrane voltage is at a rate of 14.4 mM per 50 mV
(∆n = 14.4(∆ψm/50mV)mM). The value of Π ≈ 400 atm is indicated as an approximate threshold for membrane instability.
If instead of KCl a N aCl salt is used, Π will be higher as indicated. Note that Πw > Πe for lower values of ∆ψm.

The DLVO expressions of the disjoining pressures are
bulk concentration and ion type dependent. Expression
(9) has not been used yet in the electroporation models
and theory. Besides its voltage dependence, it also re-
veals its bulk ion concentration dependence that is often
missing in the electroporation models.

The cell contains mostly K + while the extracellular
space contains mostly N a+ ions.
If diﬀerent ions are
present on each side of the membrane, as in the example
of a cell, the electroporation models predict that both
the pore density and the transmembrane potential will
be symmetric. But asymmetrical permeabilization of cell
membranes has been experimentally observed [38, 39]. In
light of DLVO, the diﬀerence in ∆Πtot may account for
this asymmetry. The disjoining pressures on both sides
of the cell will be diﬀerent, since ∆Πw will be diﬀerent
for K + and N a+ counterions. The fact that the cell
side facing the anode is being most permeable [38] is in
agreement with the Πw being larger for N a+ than for
K + counterions as seen in ﬁgure (1).

Pores live long enough (ms) for lateral diﬀusion (
≈
10−8 m in ms) to cause redistribution of lipids from one
side to the other.

Applying DLVO to present electroporation simulation

models suggests slight modiﬁcations that need to be
made. The phenomenological voltage dependent pore
creation rate with the constant B that was crudely es-
timated from Melinkov’s experiments [20], needs to be
related to the prefactor in equation (14) and equations
(15) appropriately scaled by a sutable volume. This will
make the pore creation rate dependent on the bulk con-
centration and other material properties of the system
contained in the constants, which so far was not the case.
This will also slightly change ﬁgure (2) in [20] for the
lower transmembrane voltage values, and relate the lag
time with ∆Πw and the alignment of ions against the
membrane. Since for Πw to reach its maximal value, ∆n
really needs to arrive within the Stern layer, next to the
membrane, while ∆ψm and ∆Πe do not change substan-
tially.

Some of these conclusions should be elaborated in more

details in a future work.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The standard DLVO theory, that has been used to de-
scribe the stability of thin ﬁlms, was applied to stability

FIG. 2: Proﬁle of potential ψ(x) across a membrane for diﬀerent applied ﬁelds causing transmembrane voltage ∆ψm of
100, 200, 300 (indicated) and 400 mV. On both sides near the membrane, there is an additional jump of ψ(x) ≈ 100 mV in
the Stern layer [25]. The Stern potential is not plotted on the left to indicate that ∆ψm (and the applied ﬁeld) have virtually
no eﬀect on the side potentials ψs [37]. Then it can be noted that ψs2 = ψs1 + ∆ψm. This fact is used in calculating ∆Πe
using equation (14). This plot was obtained by simulating equations (1) and (3) over time of 1 µs. Microscopic details in the
membrane were ignored and it was considered to be a dielectric slab with surface charge density of σ = 0.2 Cm

of lipid membranes aﬀected by electric ﬁelds. Electro-
poration is caused by relatively small number of ions
(
2%), compared to the number of ions already
≈
present near the membrane. When external electric ﬁeld
is applied, it breaks the symmetry of the ion distribu-
tion in the double layer on both sides of the membrane.
This gives a rise to a pressure diﬀerence ∆Π in the dis-
joining pressures on both sides on the membrane. The
pressure gradient is causing protrusion of few lipid head-
group compromising the stability of the bilayer. This idea
was supported, by estimating the changes in the disjoin-
ing pressure ∆Πtot, and comparing it with lower limit
estimates of the bilayer’s lateral pressure calculated from
statistical dynamics calculations. In comparison with the
existing electroporation models, the pore formation en-
ergy per lipid volume used in these models corresponds
to the Derjaguin’s disjoining pressures. With respect
to this, slight corrections to the existing electroporation
models were also proposed.

Finally, the dispersion interactions of the double layer
counterions and membrane lipid molecules over the Stern
layer were introduced in the context of electroporation

and membrane stability. They seem to be dominant in
the lower range of transmembrane voltages. They are ion
size speciﬁc and they complement the electrostatic com-
ponent of the disjoining pressure. Their eﬀect on metal
surfaces, for example, can be quite large, since expression
(A.5) for metals is at least an order of magnitude larger.
This can have signiﬁcant eﬀects on metal solution in-
terfaces like electrodes in batteries, fuel cell membranes,
electrochemical dealloying and similar situations.

Experimental evidence points out that electroporation
starts to occur within the range of transmembrane volt-
ages that cells are routinely experiencing. This is just
above the range of voltages involved in neural signal
transmission (less than 200mV). Pores are created on
a nanosecond timescale, but they persist for millisec-
onds. Thus, it seems that the undesirable electroporation
placed a limit on the range of transmembrane voltages
involved in neural signal transmission.

Main limitations of the standard DLVO approach pre-
sented here are the facts that Poisson-Boltzmann and Lif-
shitz theories are (continuous) mean ﬁeld theories. Also
not taken into account are few other eﬀects, as the steric

FIG. 3: Applied electric ﬁelds result in ion concentration change of ∆n(x) against the membrane, causing the indicated
transmembrane voltages ∆ψm. With time more and more ions are coming to the closest possible approach to the membrane,
which is the Stern layer (≈ 1.8˚A) [25]. The simulation was run for time of 1µs and it indicates an ion concentration change of
≈ 11 mM in the volume left (right) of the membrane for each 50 mV increase in the transmembrane voltage. An analytical
estimate for much longer times, using equation (16) indicates an accumulation of ∆n = 14.4 mM in the immediate neighborhood
of the membrane. These values are used to calculate ∆Πw, using equation (15) and they are shown in ﬁgure (1).

work.

All the data in the following estimate is from refer-
ence [25]. Calculating the integral in equation (11), for
the dielectric permittivity in the visible and the ultravi-
olet range that are dominant in the given situation, the
following estimate is obtained.

APPENDIX: ESTIMATE OF ∆Πw

To calculate exactly the integral in equation (11), the
functions ǫ(iξ), need to be known. Complete set of data
of the absorption spectra of most materials are not avail-
able. Reliable results can be obtained by several main
bands in the absorption spectra, or to a ﬁrst approxima-
tion, the visible and the near ultraviolet bands [13].

where, according to [25], the refractive indices are
nw = 1.33, nhc = 1.41, and the ion’s dielectric permit-
tivity ǫs is routinely approximated as that of a metal.
The plasma frequencies of the free electron gas are ξe =
1015s−1. Using A.2, A.3,
3.0
and A.4 in equation (11), and solving the integral for ξ

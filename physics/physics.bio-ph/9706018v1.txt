Abstract

A small model polypeptide represented in atomic detail is folded

using Monte Carlo dynamics. The polypeptide is designed to have a

native conformation similar to the central part of the helix-turn-helix

protein ROP. Starting from a β-strand conformation or two diﬀerent

loop conformations of the protein glutamine synthetase, six trajecto-

ries are generated using the so-called window move in dihedral angle

space. This move changes conformations locally and leads to realistic,

quasi-continuously evolving trajectories. Four of the six trajectories

end in stable native-like conformations. Their folding pathways show

a fast initial development of a helix-bend-helix motif, followed by a dy-

namic behaviour predicted by the diﬀusion-collision model of Karplus

and Weaver. The phenomenology of the pathways is consistent with

experimental results.

Introduction

One of the most intriguing problems in molecular biology is the decryp-
tion of the protein folding code. There is a wealth of experimental results
providing insights into kinetics and thermodynamics of the folding process
[1, 2]. They point to a delicate interplay of hydrophobic and electrostatic
interactions which guide the formation of secondary and tertiary structures.
Computer experiments on protein folding using Monte Carlo (MC) methods
with simpliﬁed lattice models also contributed very much to our understand-
ing of the principles of protein folding [3, 4]. With these simpliﬁed protein
models general aspects of protein folding can be studied. However they are
not designed to reﬂect the behavior of a particular existing protein at the
atomic level of description. The latter is the domain of conventional molec-
ular dynamics (MD) [5, 6, 7, 8]. Unfortunately conventional MD cannot be
used to address the protein folding problem for the time being. The reason
for this becomes clear if we consider that the the typical time propagation
step in MD is 1 fs, and that the CPU-time per evaluation of the energy
function is of the order of 1 s. Hence typical folding processes lasting 1 ms
to 1 s would require CPU-times of 1012 s to 1015 s.

Oﬀ-lattice MC dynamics is an alternative that can extend the time range
accessible to simulation into the folding regime [9]. We have proposed a
MC method [10, 11, 12] which combines a detailed protein model, with
dihedral angles as continuous degrees of freedom, and an eﬃcient algorithm
for the generation of new conformations. This so-called window algorithm
simulates the evolution of the polypeptide conformation by series of local
conformational changes, each one restricted to a window, i. e. a randomly
selected short stretch of polypeptide backbone. As has been shown earlier
[12] the local move, with its cooperative changes of dihedral angles in the
window, performs far better than a simple MC move where torsion angles
of the polypeptide backbone are changed independently and thus global
conformational changes are generated. Furthermore window moves simulate
the dynamical time evolution at least two orders of magnitude faster than
MD [13, 12].

In this paper we study MC trajectories for a small model protein in de-
tail. These trajectories provide an atomistic view of possible mechanisms
in the protein folding process and oﬀer interpretations for experimental re-
sults like the fast formation of secondary structure [14, 15], the existence of
transient non-native conformations [16, 17, 18], or the existence of multiple
pathways [19]. It turns out that the time evolution observed in the trajec-
tories is in good agreement with predictions made by the diﬀusion-collision
model (DCM) of Karplus and Weaver [20]. This model allows a quanti-
tative description of the folding mechanism ﬁrst proposed by Ptitsyn and
Rashin [21], and later supported by Kim and Baldwin [22], who coined the
name “framework model”. The DCM essentially states that the ﬁrst step

2

in folding is the formation of microdomains, e. g. α-helices, which diﬀuse
relatively to each other and eventually collide and coalesce with a certain
probability. In this way new and larger domains are formed, which again
collide and coalesce, etc. In this sense the formation of an α-helical hairpin
can be understood as an elementary event of the DCM.

The model system

The simulation of protein folding with a detailed model demands great
amounts of CPU-time. Therefore it is important to choose a protein that is
as simple as possible. It nevertheless should have features typical of proteins,
i. e. a native state with secondary and tertiary structure. These structural
elements are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.
Hence, the model should consider corresponding energy terms. ROP is a
simple protein that has secondary structure and tertiary contacts [23]. It
forms an α-helix-turn-α-helix, that is a so-called α-helical hairpin motif.
The central part of ROP, consisting of the 26 residues from 18 to 43, is used
as a template for the construction of a model polypeptide. Three types of
amino acids are used. The ﬁve residues in the central turn are replaced by
glycines (G) which are known to have a high propensity to form turns. The
residues responsible for interhelical contacts are assigned to residues of type
X that diﬀer from alanines only in the increased attraction between Cβ-
atoms of X residues, mimicking a hydrophobic interaction. This attraction
is modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential with a well-depth of 2.0 kcal/mol,
a value that is motivated by the free energy changes for transfer of typical
hydrophobic amino acids from a non-polar to a polar solvent [24, 25]. All
remaining residues are replaced by alanines (A). Alanines are often found in
α-helical secondary structure of proteins, and in MD simulations of polyala-
nine α-helices are formed in vacuo [26, 27]. The whole sequence of the
model polypeptide reads AXAAXAAAXXGGGGGXXAAAXAAAXA. The
terminal alanines are blocked with neutral acetamide and N-methyl-amide
groups to avoid strong Coulombic interactions. Since each of the sidechains
of A and X is represented by a single, so-called extended Cβ-atom [5], there
are no torsional degrees of freedom in the sidechains. The similarity of the
model polypeptide with the original ROP is merely a structural one, insofar
as it has a high propensity to form a α-helical hairpin. With respect to other
properties there may be signiﬁcant diﬀerences between model polypeptide
and ROP, e.g. the ROP monomer is not stable in aqueous solution [28].

The bond lengths and bond angles of the model polypeptide, as well as
the dihedral angles ωi(Cα,iCiNi+1Cα,i+1) are ﬁxed to equilibrium values pro-
vided by the parameter set of the MD programme CHARMM22 [5]. Thus
the only remaining degrees of freedom of the model polypeptide are the di-
hedral angles φ(Ci−1NiCα,iCi) and ψ(NiCα,iCiNi+1) in the backbone. The
force ﬁeld is adopted from the MD programme CHARMM, with speciﬁc
changes to compensate the greater rigidity of the polypeptide model due
to the ﬁxed bond lengths and bond angles. This compensation is achieved
by replacing the explicit atom pair interactions between sequentially neigh-
bouring amide planes by an eﬀective two-dimensional (φ, ψ) torsion potential
which implicitely considers the ﬂexibility of the rigidiﬁed degrees of freedom.
This torsion potential is obtained once by constrained energy minimization

4

of dipeptides with ﬁxed values of φ and ψ but all other degrees of freedom
unconstrained, as described by Brooks et al.
[5].
Apart from the replacement of the respective atom pair interactions by the
torsion potential, the energy function is that of CHARMM [5].

in Appendix 2 of Ref.

For each move a window is placed randomly on the polypeptide, the con-
formation is changed in the window, and the energy of the new conformation
is evaluated. The diﬀerence of energy between the new and the preceding
conformation is then used in the criterion of Metropolis et al. [29] to decide
whether the MC move is accepted or rejected. Conformations generated
by this procedure represent a canonical ensemble at the given temperature
T .
In the present case only windows containing three peptide planes are
used because there the acceptance probability is particularly favorable with
values ranging from 0.3 to 0.4.

In a ﬁrst step the rigidiﬁed backbone of the model polypeptide was ﬁtted
to the considered central part of the x-ray structure of ROP by minimiz-
ing the root mean square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the backbone
atoms.
In this ROP-ﬁtted conformation the model polypeptide possesses
ﬁve interhelical X–X pairs with Cβ-Cβ distances of less than 6 ˚A and a well
developed system of α-helical hydrogen bonds in each of the two helices.
There are no strains in this conformation as can be concluded from energy
minimization, that is Metropolis MC at T = 0 K, where the conformation
changes by less than 1 ˚A RMSD and the energy drops from −1140 kcal/mol
to −1200 kcal/mol. Thus the designed amino acid sequence has a native con-
formation close to that of the ROP-ﬁtted conformation. This assumption
is supported further by eight simulated annealing simulations with initial
temperatures of 1000–3000 K starting from the ROP-ﬁtted conformation
of the model polypeptide. In these simulations the conformation of lowest
energy (−1215 kcal/mol), the “reference structure”, had a RMSD of 1.35 ˚A
to the ROP-ﬁtted conformation.

It has been shown elsewhere [12] that window moves are able to simulate
the folding of this model polypeptide. Here we analyse the folding process
in more detail. Six trajectories were generated at T = 450 K, a temperature
low enough for the designed native conformation being stable, and high
enough to facilitate folding within a reasonable short amount of CPU-time.
The elevated temperature can compensate for the missing aqueous solvent,
whose presence would weaken intra-polypeptide interactions like hydrogen
bonding. Furthermore isomerization barriers are still somewhat to high
compared with those encountered in MD simulations despite the adaptation
of the energy function to the rigidiﬁed polypeptide model. Thus T = 450 K
corresponds to a lower temperature for MD simulations in aqueous solution.

Results and discussion

Six trajectories were generated. Four of them (β-trajectories) started from
a β-strand conformation (φ = −120◦, ψ = 120◦). This conformation is quite
elongated, and thus far away from the “native” helical hairpin structure,
but unlike the fully extended conformation, for the β-strand the interac-
tions of neighbouring peptide planes are in a local minimum. Hence the
In or-
β-strand seems to be a reasonable model for a denaturated state.
der to investigate the sensitivity of the results to the initial conditions, the
remaining two trajectories (loop-trajectories) started from two other con-
formations, namely the one of loop Glu 13 – Asn 39 and of loop Lys 163 –
Gln 189 (Fig. 1), respectively, of chain F in the protein complex glutamine
synthetase (PDB code 2gls) [30]. These two loops have completely diﬀerent
structures and are devoid of helical turns. Hence there is no bias towards the
α-helical hairpin. Five out of the six trajectories end up in helix-turn-helix
conformations which after minimization have lower energies than the refer-
ence structure introduced in the previous section. The two loop-trajectories
and two of the β-trajectories are well equilibrated after about 106 MC scans
of window moves (in a MC scan the window is placed randomly on the
polypeptide backbone as many times as there are possible window posi-
tions).
In the end they show only modest ﬂuctuations of the energy and
of structural quantities like the radius of gyration. These four trajectories
deliver conformations close to the reference structure (all-atom root mean
square deviations 2.3, 2.7, 3.2, 3.8 ˚A, respectively), and the number of inter-
helical X–X pairs with Cβ-Cβ distance smaller than 6 ˚A is ﬁve to six, which
is identical to that of the reference structure. The mean energies in the
equilibrated parts of the four trajectories lie at about -1190 kcal/mol. The
other two β-trajectories lead to a single long helix, and a helix-turn-helix
motif with some left handed helical turns, respectively. The single helix
shows fraying at the termini and also bending dynamics, but develops no
stable loop between two helices. Due to the missing X–X interactions the
mean energy (-1175 kcal/mol) of the trajectory is signiﬁcantly higher than
of the other trajectories. The same holds true for the structure with the
left handed helix turns, which prevent the formation of all possible interhe-
lical X–X pairs. These two trajectories hence represent diﬀerent free energy
minima above the minimum corresponding to the “native” helical hairpin.
They could reach this lower minimum by breaking some helical hydrogen
bonds in the case of the long helix, or by expansion and refolding with the
correct righthanded helical turns in the case of the other trajectory. Both
trajectories explore conformations towards these barriers but do not cross
them during the simulation of 2 · 106 MC scans. In the following we focus
mainly on the folding paths observed in the two equilibrated β-trajectories,
which we call trajectory (1) and (2), respectively. These two trajectories are
representative for those four trajectories which converge into α-helical hair-

6

pins. If not mentioned otherwise the described observations refer to both
trajectories.

Within the ﬁrst few tens of thousands of MC scans the elongated β-
strand relaxes into a mainly α-helical conformation (Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c)).
The initiations of the helices take place almost simultaneously at diﬀerent
locations of the polypeptide, but preferentially near the termini. The only
exception is the C-terminal helix in trajectory (1) which begins to grow at
residues 17, 18 and 19. Each helix grows until it reaches the nearest termi-
nus, or until it is stopped by a multiple turn structure near the center of
the polypeptide at one end of the stretch of glycines. At this stage the turn
structure consists mainly of X and A residues, and most of the glycines are
incorporated into one of the two helices. This is particularly noteworthy be-
cause usually glycines act as helix breakers. However there are experiments
indicating that non-native conformations can have appreciably populated
non-native secondary structures [17, 18]. In this context it is interesting to
note that peptide fragments of myohemerythrin [16] and plastocyanin [31]
which include the loop and turn regions of the native proteins clearly show
α-helix content.

The turn region functions as a buﬀer between the N- and C-terminal
helices, preventing them from uniﬁcation. The helix growth is accompanied
by a sharp drop in energy (Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)) from −1008 kcal/mol for
the initial β-strand conformation to about −1175 kcal/mol, mainly origi-
nating from the formation of helical hydrogen bonds and other attractive
sequence local interactions. The increasing helix content is also visible in
the contraction from 25 ˚A to 10 ˚A radius of gyration Rgyr, or 82 ˚A to 32 ˚A
end-end-distance Rends (Figs. 2(c) and 3(c)). The observed fast formation
of secondary structure as a ﬁrst step in the folding process is consistent
with experimental ﬁndings for a variety of proteins, like cytochrome c and
β-lactoglobulin [14], ribonuclease A [15], lysozyme [19], or Escherichia coli
trp aporepressor [32].

The phase of helix formation ends after 105 MC scans and can be clearly
distinguished from the following second phase in which the helix content re-
mains essentially constant but Rends ﬂuctuates considerably. In other words
the two α-helices are diﬀusing relatively to each other as quasi rigid entities
with only the interhelical angle changing randomly (Figs. 2(d) and 3(d)). In
trajectory (1) this diﬀusion leads to a near coalescence of the two helices after
about
3 · 105 MC scans where Rends and Rgyr drop sharply. Simultaneously the
number of pairs of non-neighbouring hydrophobic X residues with Cβ-Cβ
distances less than 6 ˚A increases transiently from one or two to six. At the
same time the short N-terminal helix unravels almost completely (Fig. 4(b)).
During this near-coalescence the energy trace shows no dramatic change.
The new more compact conformation is unstable and decays into a more
elongated one, while the short N-terminal helix recovers. The diﬀusion of

7

the angle between the two helices lasts for about 3 · 105 and 105 MC scans
in trajectory (1) and (2), respectively. The shorter diﬀusion phase in tra-
jectory (2) may account for the lack of near-coalescence events like that
observed in trajectory (1). For both trajectories the energy has a value of
−1160 ± 10 kcal/mol during the helix angle diﬀusion.

It is notable that trajectories (1) and (2), although being formally very
similar and undistinguishable if for example only the development of the
helix content would be monitored, represent two diﬀerent folding pathways.
In (1) the turn forms in the N-terminal half of the sequence (Fig. 4(b)),
whereas in (2) it forms in the C-terminal half (Fig. 4(c)). Thus in (1) a
short N-terminal helix coalesces with a longer C-terminal one, while in (2)
a short C-terminal helix joins a longer N-terminal one (Figs. 5 and 6). The
existence of multiple folding pathways has also been suggested to explain
experiments on ribonuclease [33] and lysozyme [19].

The period of relative diﬀusion of the interhelical angle is terminated by
the coalescence of the two helices. The coalescence is initiated by the for-
mation of a cluster of hydrophobic X residues at the shorter helix, inducing
a sharp reverse turn and bending the shorter helix towards the longer one.
Then this bent conformation leads to the formation of the ﬁrst interhelical
hydrophobic X-X pairs. The number of X-X pairs is still small, indicating
the non-native character of the conformations in this phase. The non-native
character can also be seen from the fact that shortly after coalescence the
glycines in the center of the sequence are still part of one of the helices
and hence the α-hairpin is quite asymmetric with a shorter and a longer
helix (trajectory (1) after 460000 MC scans, Fig. 5, and trajectory (2) after
160000 MC scans, Fig. 6).

Now a new type of movement can be observed. The respective shorter
helix begins to creep along the longer one. This movement is driven by the
attraction of X residues in interhelical X-X pairs and leads to the forma-
tion of an increasing number of X-X pairs. The creeping generates a pull
which is transmitted onto the longer helix through the connecting reverse
turn. Eventually this pull forces the glycines out of the helical turn into the
reverse turn and thus the reverse turn expands at the expense of the longer
helix. Finally the lengths of the two helices making up the hairpin are ap-
proximately equal in length. During the process of creeping, which lasts for
1.6·105 MC scans, the energy drops by 20 kcal/mol to about −1190 kcal/mol.
This drop is mainly due to the formation of X-X pairs, rising in number from
one to about ﬁve. As a further result of the process of creeping, Rends falls
from 15 ˚A, shortly after coalescence, to 4–5 ˚A (Figs. 2(c) and 3(c)), i. e.
the hairpin is complete.

After the creeping process has stopped and a compact helical hairpin
conformation is reached, the structural ﬂuctuations of the hairpin are re-
duced considerably. In the picture of the folding funnel [34] the trajectories
have reached a thermodynamic bottleneck, where the multiple folding path-

8

ways approach the native state from diﬀerent sides and are slowed down
by entropic barriers. Nevertheless further rearrangements can be observed.
For example in trajectory (1) after 1.2 · 106 MC scans there is a cooperative
reorganization of the two termini which goes along with an increase of helix
content by one residue, and an increase in the number of X-X pairs to a
value ﬂuctuating between ﬁve and six (Fig. 4(b)). Due to these changes the
energy goes down from −1190 kcal/mol to about −1200 kcal/mol. In trajec-
tory (2) a remarkable development takes place at 106 MC scans (Fig. 4(c))
when the glycines in the turn region, which previously had ﬂickered between
helical and other turn conformations, are forming a short α-helix which is
stable for a few thousand MC scans. This process is also visible in the en-
ergy trace as a transient increase by about 10 kcal/mol. At the same time
the number of hydrophobic X-X pairs decreases momentarily by two. The
glycine helix collapses very suddenly, and all but one glycine are ﬁnally sta-
bilized in a non-helical turn conformation. After the collapse of the glycine
helix, energy and number of X-X pairs return to their previous levels, but
the conformation has changed to a near-native one with a stable non-helical
turn of glycines between two helices.

The folding pathways in trajectories (1) and (2) are consistent with the
diﬀusion-collision model (DCM) of Karplus and Weaver [20] which provides
a theoretical framework for protein folding and is supported by a large num-
ber of experimental ﬁndings [35]. As pointed out in the introduction, the
essence of the DCM is that in the folding process microdomains are formed,
e. g. α-helices, which diﬀuse relatively to each other. Eventually they col-
lide and then coalesce with a certain probability. This behaviour is observed
in trajectories (1) and (2). The helices are formed and diﬀuse relatively to
each other as quasi rigid bodies by random changes of the interhelical angle.
In the DCM, a collision of microdomains does not necessarily imply that
they remain together. This has been observed in trajectory (1) where after
a ﬁrst collision the two helices separate again and continue their relative
diﬀusion. The DCM further allows that “after partial collapse and/or weak
coalescence of microdomains to a more compact structure with a non-native
conformation, the attainment of the native conformation might involve sur-
face diﬀusion in one or two dimensions” [35]. The creeping motion observed
in both trajectories is such a one-dimensional diﬀusion. It is also reminis-
cent of the reptation movement introduced by de Gennes [36] for polymers
in polymer melts and hence could be called self-reptation. Note that this
self-reptation movement is diﬀerent from other dynamic processes where a
net increase of helix content is observed in parallel to a formation of a helix
dimer (e.g. as in [37]). During self-reptation of the present α-helical hairpin
the total helix content remains approximately constant and helical turns are
shifted from the Glycine stretch to the neighbouring amino acids.

The DCM not only pictures the folding process qualitatively but also
allows the prediction of measurable quantities. For example it is possible to

9

estimate the time τf for the folding of the two helices, i. e. the time between
their generation and their ultimate coalescence, using Eq. 1 [38, 35]:

τf = l2/D + L∆V (1 − β)/(DAβ),

(1)

where l is a length related to the size of the diﬀusion space, D is the rela-
tive diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the microdomains, L is a length related to fold-
ing/unfolding rates and also to the size of the diﬀusion space, ∆V is the
diﬀusion volume, A is the collision surface area, and β is the relative coa-
lescence probability or sticking probability for a collision event. Following
the procedures for the evaluation of these quantities in Refs. [38, 35] and as-
suming that the microdomains are two helices of twelve and eight residues,
respectively, connected by a loop of six residues, we obtain the following
values: l2 = 664 ˚A2, D = 0.138 ˚A2/ps, L = 16.3 ˚A, ∆V = 2.30 · 105 ˚A3,
and A = 2590 ˚A2. In Refs. [38, 35] β is treated as a free parameter. A large
number of simulations of the type presented in this section could be used to
determine the probability β more accurately. For a very crude ﬁrst estimate
of β we restrict ourselves to the current data. Since there a near-coalescence
occurred only once, the value of β should be of the order of one for the
model polypeptide. A value of 0.5 seems a reasonable guess for an order of
magnitude estimation. Assuming these parameter values for the quantities
in Eq. 1 we ﬁnd τf = 2.29 · 10−8 s. This time can be used to estimate
the time corresponding to one MC scan. An inspection of the trajectories
shows that the helices coalesce after a diﬀusion period of about 2 · 105 MC
scans. Thus one MC scan is approximately equal to 0.1 ps, and hence each
of the MC trajectories runs over about 160 ns. Independently and based on
a comparison of dynamic MC with MD simulations over long times we have
recently estimated the MC scan to be of the same order of magnitude [12],
i. e. about two orders of magnitude larger than the time step of conven-
tional MD. Earlier estimates based on comparisons with the Rouse polymer
model [39] yielded a value for the time corresponding to one MC scan which
was one order of magnitude larger but did not consider contributions of
non-bonded interactions [13].

Previously it was thought that because of the long times involved in the
diﬀusion process, simulations at the atomic level could not be carried out
long enough to show aspects of the DCM during protein folding. Therefore
simulations have been restricted to the microdomain level of resolution us-
ing preformed and explicitely stabilized microdomains [40, 38, 35]. These
simulations were valuable to explore general questions concerning the DCM
in larger proteins, but of course under these simulation conditions it had
to be expected that the trajectories would obey the DCM. Other workers
have used simpliﬁed lattice models [41]; [42] and found no DCM behaviour.
Instead in these models “rather, the helices that form native hairpins are
constructed on-site, with folding initiating at or near the turn” [41]. It had

10

been suspected that the disagreement with DCM may be due to the lo-
cal moves that had been employed in these lattice simulations which would
not allow the diﬀusion of intact microdomains [35]. Our results show that
this argument is not valid in this general form, because the trajectories de-
scribed above clearly show the diﬀusion of microdomains despite the use
of local moves.
It seems more likely that the disagreement with DCM is
related to the combined use of lattice models and local moves. Interestingly,
Rey and Skolnick [43] compared lattice simulations and oﬀ-lattice Brownian
Dynamics simulations. Whereas in the lattice simulations the folding of an
α-helical hairpin was not consistent with a DCM like process, some of the
Brownian Dynamics trajectories clearly followed the DCM scheme.

In the case of our model polypeptide the existence of relatively stable
helices certainly promotes the folding according to the DCM. But relatively
stable and fast folding polyalanine-based helices are not unusual [44, 45],
hence for the given sequence of amino acids, which is dominated by ala-
nines, one should expect DCM like folding. Experimentally, for arbitrary
sequences mixtures of various folding mechanisms are observed, including
global diﬀusion of larger parts of the respective proteins (see e.g. Ref. [46]).

Conclusions

Trajectories of a small model protein were produced using a dynamic MC
method with window moves. These oﬀ-lattice MC moves generate eﬃciently
and realistically conformational changes of a polypeptide. A molecular
model in atomic detail with only dihedral angle degrees of freedom, and
an energy function derived from a conventional MD model were employed.
Due to the ability of MC to generate larger conformational changes per move
than MD can generate per step of time propagation, the MC method reaches
longer time regimes than MD with the same amount of CPU-time.

Starting from an extended β-strand conformation or from loop confor-
mations of the protein glutamine synthetase, four out of six trajectories
equilibrated into a native-like α-helical hairpin conformation within about
106 MC scans. Three phases of time evolution can be clearly distinguished in
these trajectories: 1. fast formation of two α-helices separated by a turn, 2.
diﬀusion of the interhelical angle, 3. coalescence of the two helices followed
by a self-reptation into a native-like helix-turn-helix conformation. All three
phases are consistent with experiments and in accord with predictions made
by the DCM [35].

The comparison of the folding time predicted for the α-helical hairpin by
the DCM with the folding times observed in the MC trajectories yielded a
value for the time corresponding to one MC scan of the order of 0.1 ps. This
value is in agreement with an independent estimate using a comparison of
MD and dynamic MC simulations [12].

Further work is necessary to allow a quantitative comparison of such
simulations with experimental results. In particular the energy function has
to be reﬁned to consider more quantitatively contributions of the solvent
and of a greater variety of sidechains.

Figure 1: Conformations from the two trajectories starting from two loop

conformations of polypeptide chain F of the protein glutamine synthetase

(2glsF). White and black spheres are Cα atoms of glycines and hydrophobic

X residues, respectively. The ﬁgures were generated using Molscript [47].

N-terminus of polypeptide is always the upper end. Upper left: start confor-

mation corresponding to loop 13 to 39 of 2glsF. Lower left: conformation of

lowest energy (-1219 kcal/mol) in trajectory starting from conformation in
upper left (after 2.8 · 106 MC scans). All-atom root mean square deviation
(RMSD) to reference structure is 3.2 ˚A. Upper right: start conformation

corresponding to loop 163-189 of 2glsF. Lower right: conformation of lowest

energy (-1212 kcal/mol) in trajectory starting from conformation in upper
right (after 1.6 · 106 MC scans). RMSD to reference structure is 2.7 ˚A.

Figure 2: Traces of energy, number of pairs of hydrophobic X residues,

end-end distance Rends, and interhelical angle in MC trajectory (1). The
abscissa of part (d) gives the time in units of 105 MC scans.

It is used

for all four parts of this ﬁgur. The value of the respective quantities after

every 5000th MC scan is depicted. (a) Conformational energy. (b) Number

of pairs of X residues. Two X residues are considered a pair if they are
not neighbours in sequence and their Cβ-atoms are closer than 6 ˚A. (c)

Distance Rends between ﬁrst and last Cα-atom of the polypeptide chain. (d)

Interhelical angle deﬁned as angle between sum of C = O bondvectors in

the ﬁrst helix (residues 2 to 6), and sum of O = C bondvectors in the second

helix (residues 15 to 22).

17

Figure 3: Trajectory (2). Axes are the same as in Fig. 2. Note however

that in part (d) the interhelical angle refers to the angle between the sum

of C = O bondvectors of residues 4 to 11, and sum of O = C bondvectors

of residues 19 to 24.

Figure 4: Time evolution of (φ, ψ) values of each of the 26 residues

(structure-dynamograms). (a) Graylevel code for structure-dynamograms

(parts (b) and (c)). Each graylevel codes for a rectangular region in the

Ramachandran plot around a secondary structure, e. g. white codes for αR-

helical residues. Residues having no canonical structure are coded in black

(here not shown for technical reasons). Parts (b) and (c) are structure-

dynamograms of MC trajectories (1) and (2), respectively. Conformations
are depicted after every 104th MC scan.

Figure 5: Coalescence and self reptation in MC trajectory (1). The time is

given in numbers of MC scans. Cα-atoms of glycines and hydrophobic X

residues are shown as white and black spheres, respectively. Wide ribbons

are α-helix turns. N and C indicate N- and C-terminus, respectively. The

pictures where generated using Molscript [47].

Buckling transition in icosahedral shells subjected to volume conservation constraint:
relations to virus maturation

Antonio ˇSiber∗
Institute of Physics, P.O. Box 304, 10001 Zagreb, Croatia

Minimal energy shapes of closed, elastic shells with twelve pentagonal disclinations introduced
in otherwise hexagonally coordinated crystalline lattice are studied. The geometry and the total
energy of shells are studied as a function of the elastic properties of the material they are made of.
Particular emphasis is put on the buckling transition of the shells, that is a strong preference of the
shell shapes to ’buckle out’ in spatial regions close to the pentagonal disclinations for certain range of
the elastic parameters of the problem. The transition eﬀectively increases the mean square aspherity
of shapes, making them look more like an icosahedron, rather than a sphere which is a preferred
shape prior to the onset of the transition. The properties of the buckling transition are studied in
cases when the total volume enclosed by the elastic shell has to be ﬁxed. This may be related to
maturation process in non-enveloped dsDNA viruses, where the insertion of the genetic material
in a pre-formed protein shell (viral coating) may eﬀectively impose the ﬁxed volume constraint.
Several scenarios that may explain the experimentally observed feature of mature viruses being
more aspherical (facetted) from their immature precursors are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Several articles have appeared recently that aim to describe the virus structure, shape and stability by using
physical principles. Virus related research seems to be particularly appealing to physicists since viruses exhibit
many features that are reminiscent of well known and thoroughly studied phenomena in ”more traditional” physical
systems. For example, ﬁfty years ago Fraenkel-Conrat demonstrated that infectious viral particles (tobacco mosaic
viruses, TMV) can be reassembled from two solutions, one containing the viral genetic material (RNA) and the
other its coat (or capsid) proteins (a short historical overview of research on reconstitution of TMV can be found
in Ref.
[1]). The reassembly of TMV proceeds without any special external impetus - it is spontaneous. The fact
that viruses can be reassembled in in vitro conditions suggests that their shape and symmetry should be a result
of free energy minimization, a concept familiar from equilibrium thermodynamics. This line of thought has recently
been successfully applied in the explanation of physical origin of the icosahedral symmetry of viruses (see below)
and other possible shapes and geometries that might be adopted by viruses [2]. Production of functional molecular
machine from its constituent, possibly engineered molecular components is of course a dream of nanotechnologists.
Such approach to ”molecular engineering” does not require precise molecular positioning, since correct assembly takes
place spontaneously due to speciﬁc architecture of the molecular constituents and pronounced anisotropy of their
mutual interactions, hence the term self-assembly is often used in nanotechnological context.

The structural symmetry and shape of virus coating is in itself intriguing. There have been attempts to draw
parallels between the symmetry of viruses, Penrose tilings [3], and quasicrystals [4]. Most viruses have a structure
with topology equal to that of triangulated icosahedra (see Fig 1). Individual proteins that make the viral coating

FIG. 1: (Color online) Idealized T = 7 (h = 1, k = 2) virus structure. The structure consists of twelve pentamers (at the
vertices of an icosahedron) and sixty hexamers. Note how the neighboring pentamers can be connected with two subsequent
translations along two distinct spherical geodesics.

(approximated by triangles in Fig. 1) are organized in units called capsomers that consist of ﬁve (pentamers) or
six protein units (hexamers). Most viruses contain only twelve pentamers and remaining capsomers are hexamers
[5]. Pentamers are located at twelve vertices of an icosahedron. Such structures are very similar to giant fullerene
molecules [6]. It is also easy to see a structural relationship between the virus and an icosahedral geodesic dome [7].
One of the simplest virus structures (T = 3, see below), characteristic of small viruses (e.g. cucumber mosaic virus

∗Electronic address: asiber@ifs.hr

2

[8]), contains twelve pentamers and twenty hexamers and is topologically equivalent to a famous buckminsterfullerene
molecule (C60) [9].
Icosahedral symmetry that is characteristic of viral shapes is also frequently found in ground
[10]). Poligonalizaton of a sphere with pentagons and hexagons
state conﬁgurations of atomic clusters (see e.g.
is often described in terms of Caspar-Klug quasiequivalent construction [11]. Within this framework, viruses are
characterized by the so-called T number which describes the order of a poligonalization. The T number can be
written as T = h2 + k2 + hk, where h and k are nonnegative integers. The meaning of these integers can be quickly
grasped from Fig. 1. Note how the two neighboring pentamers in the structure displayed in Fig. 1 can be connected
through two subsequent translations along two distinct spherical geodesics. The magnitudes of these translations
are nonnegative integer multiples (h and k) of distances between the nearest-neighboring capsomers, so as that the
structure in Fig. 1 can be characterized by h = 1 and k = 2, or T = 7. The total number of capsomeric units in a
virus of particular T -number symmetry is 10T + 2. Twelve of these units are pentamers and remaining 10(T
1) are
hexamers [5].

The shapes of viral capsids have been recently studied within the framework of nonlinear theory of elastic shells
[12, 13]. These studies have produced rather interesting results and excellent ﬁts to experimentally determined virus
shapes have been obtained [12]. The most important feature of the shell shapes that these studies predict is the
buckling transition. The buckling transition has been earlier predicted for planar triangular meshes with a pentagonal
or heptagonal defect introduced in their structure [14]. As a consequence of minimization of the total energy, which
includes both stretching and bending contributions, the crystalline mesh buckles into a conical shape in the vicinity of
a pentagonal defect (or disclination). This transition is observed only above the critical value of the so-called Foppl-
von K´arm´an number (γ) [14], which is an eﬀective parameter combining the mesh radius, two-dimensional Young’s
modulus (Y ) and bending rigidity (κ) and uniquely describing the shape of continuous shells. A pentagonal ”defect”
(pentamer) is characteristic of a virus structure, and viral coating can thus be viewed as a continuous shell with
twelve pentagonal disclinations introduced in otherwise hexagonally coordinated crystalline structure (each vertex in
the mesh has six nearest neighbors). The two studies [12, 13] have reached the conclusion that the remnants of buckling
transitions survive in the more complex geometry of a spherical (closed) shell with twelve pentagonal disclinations.
This transition is not as sharp as in the case of a (two-dimensional) disk, nevertheless an observable buckling transition
of the shell was found for Foppl-von K´arm´an numbers between about γ = 100 and γ = 1000. This eﬀect has been
related to the features of the experimentally determined virus shapes, and it can correctly describe the global trend
of larger viruses being more faceted (or buckled) than smaller ones [15]. One of the interesting propositions put forth
by the authors of Ref. [12] is that the process of virus maturation can be described in part by the buckling transition
of viral capsids. Virus maturation is the process through which the assembled viral particles become fully functional.
Its precise evolution depends on the type (or family) of the virus in question, in particular whether the viruses are
enveloped by the cell membrane proteins or not. For a large class of non-enveloped viruses [e.g. those containing the
double stranded DNA (dsDNA) in their mature form [15]], the maturation consists of incorporation of the genetic
material in a preassembled, empty protein capsid (the so called precursor capsid or procapsid). During the maturation
process the capsid typically ”swells” and mature capsids are larger from their precursor counterparts. A faceted shape
is often a characteristic of a mature virus, whereas (immature) precursor capsids have a more spherical shape. This
transition in shape has been described within a framework of the elastic theory of shells in terms of the change of the
Foppl-von K´arm´an number [12]. However, during the buckling transition of elastic shells, the volume enclosed by the
shell decreases, whereas for most viruses, the mature viral capsids enclose larger volume from the immature precursor
capsids [16, 17].

The aim of this article is to investigate whether the buckling transition in elastic shells survives in more restrictive
circumstances, in particular under the constraint of volume conservation (imagine pouring an incompressible liquid
into an elastic shell). The volume conservation constraint can also be thought of as the simplest possible introduction
of the capsid-DNA/RNA interaction in the problem of virus shapes. This is of course true only if one approximates the
genetic material as an incompressible and non-expandable ”liquid” which must be in contact with a capsid, but which
can otherwise rearrange to any required shape without consumption of energy. In any case, an investigation of the
characteristics of buckling transition in more general conditions should be of use for a more thorough understanding
of viral capsid shapes.

There have also been slight disagreements between the results of Refs. [12] and [13] with respect to the numerical
characterization of the buckling transition, in particular concerning the value of the ”critical” Foppl-von K´arm´an
number, γb . Authors of Ref. [12] found that γb

The article is organized as follows. Section II brieﬂy discusses the model of elasticity and minimal energy shapes
of shells with 12 pentagonal disclinations subjected to a constraint of ﬁxed volume. Section III contains the results
pertaining to empty shells, i.e. without the imposition of the ﬁxed volume constraint. This section deals with the
subject already treated in Refs.
[12] and [13], and its main purpose is to resolve the discrepancies between the two
previous studies, but also to clearly demonstrate that the shell volume decreases during the buckling transition. In

section IV, the minimal energy shell shapes with the imposed constraint of ﬁxed enclosed volume are studied. It is
shown that the buckling transition survives in that case also, although the buckled shapes are less aspherical than
the ones obtained without the volume conservation constraint. Section V relates the results of the article to the virus
maturation process. Several possible scenarios that reproduce the experimentally observed fact of mature viruses
being more aspherical, facetted from their immature precursors are discussed. Section VI brieﬂy summarizes the
results and concludes the article.

II. A MODEL OF ELASTIC SHELLS WITH THE CONSTRAINT OF FIXED ENCLOSED VOLUME

I start from the model of elasticity described in Refs. [12, 13, 14]. Brieﬂy, the shell surface is discretized in triangular

plaquettes and the Hamiltonian describing such system is

where indices i and j (I and J) describe the two neighboring triangle vertices (surfaces) located at ri and rj respec-
tively, ǫ is the scale of energy related to a change of the distance between the two neighboring vertices (stretching),
while ˜κ is the scale of energy related to a change of dihedral angle (bending) between the two neighboring triangles
(those sharing a side) whose normal vectors are denoted by n. The equilibrium distance between the two neighboring
vertices is a, and it is assumed that the neighboring triangular plaquettes prefer to lie in the same plane, i.e. the
preferred angle between their normal vectors is zero. Authors of Ref. [13] considered also the case of nonzero preferred
curvature of the surface which can be simply introduced in the above Hamiltonian [13]. For the surfaces containing a
very large number of triangular plaquettes, the discrete Hamiltonian becomes reliable for the description of continuous
elastic medium described by Young’s modulus Y = 2ǫ/√3, Poisson’s ratio ν = 1/3, bending rigidity κ = √3˜κ/2, and
Gaussian rigidity κG =

4/3 [12].

Finding a minimum-energy state (or a shape) of a problem deﬁned by Eq. (1) consists of multidimensional search
for a minimum of the Hamiltonian function H(r1, ..., rN ) that depends on 3N coordinates, where N is the number
of mesh vertices. This search is unconstrained which means that there are no relationships between the variables
r1, ..., rN that have to be obeyed. It is, however, possible to do a constrained search for the minimum of Eq. (1),
specifying additionally some relations that the variables (or a shape) have to obey. The volume of a shell can be
expressed in terms of the coordinates of the mesh vertices as

−

where rI,1, rI,2, and rI,3 are the three vertices of the triangle I in (counter)clockwise order. A search for a minimum
of Eq. (1) with the independent variables (vertex coordinates) additionally fulﬁlling V = V0, where V0 is a ﬁxed
quantity, should result in a shape that minimizes the function H(r1, ..., rN ) in the subspace of all possible shapes that
enclose volume V0.

III. EMPTY ICOSAHEDRAL SHELLS

A word of caution concerning the T -numbers of triangulated shells used by the authors of Refs.

[12, 13] and
Caspar-Klug T -numbers pertaining to viral shells is in order here. It should be understood that these two are not the
same. For example, for the idealized virus structure in Fig. 1, the Caspar-Klug T -number is 7 (h = 1, k = 2), while
the T -number characteristic of a kind of triangulation (without reference to pentamer/hexamer structures [12, 13])
is 21 (h = 4, k = 1, this can be obtained by simply following a path from one pentamer to its neighboring pentamer
with integer steps along the sides of the mesh triangles and not through the centers of pentamer/hexamer structures).
Of course, the two T -numbers become the same if every vertex in the triangular mesh corresponds to the center of
a capsomer. In what follows, I shall reserve the term ”T -number” for the characterization of the shell triangulation,
while the term ”Caspar-Klug T -number” shall be used for the characterization of T -numbers in the context in which
they were originally introduced.

Icosahedral shells with various T -numbers have been constructed and their total energy (E, which includes both
stretching and bending contributions) as a function of bending modulus, κ has been calculated. Other parameters
of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) have been kept ﬁxed (a = 1, ǫ = 1). The inital shape has been setup [typically a
5T √3/π/2, see Eq. (8)], and the minimum energy shape was obtained by an eﬃcient

sphere with a radius of a

q

implementation of the conjugate gradient method described in Ref.
[12],
the shape and energy of continuous shells (large T -numbers) are unique functions of the Foppl-von K´arm´an number
which can be expressed as

[18]. As suggested by the authors of Ref.

(T = 100, 400, 625, 1225, 3025).

It can be seen that the continuum regime concerning the total energy of the shell is reached rather slowly and
large T -numbers are needed in this respect. This is especially true in the region of large Foppl-von K´arm´an numbers
(γ > 20000). Shells with smaller T -numbers can reliably predict the continuum shapes in the region 0 < γ < 20000.
Based on quite general considerations, the authors of Ref. [12] concluded that the energy of a closed triangular shell
(without the enclosed volume conservation constraint) with twelve pentagonal disclinations situated at the icosahedron
vertices should behave as

E
κ

=

(

6Bγ/γb + D, γ < γb

6B[1 + ln(γ/γb)] + D, γ > γb,

where D is a constant contribution to the energy due to the ”background curvature” of a sphere, B is a numerical
constant which could be interpreted as a pentagonal disclination ”core energy” and which should be reasonably close
to π/3, and γb is a critical Foppl-von K´arm´an number indicating approximately the region in which the buckling
transition takes place. For the (unbuckled) shapes described by γ < γb, the total energy is approximately given by the
sum of elastic stretching energy of twelve ”unbuckled” pentagonal disclinations (6Bγ/γb) and by the ”background”
elastic energy, D - there is no buckling contribution related to pentagonal disclinations other than the overall, mean
background curvature. For the buckled shapes (γ > γb), the functional dependence of the energy related to disclina-
tions profoundly changes, and one has to account for the energies resulting from the bending of the conical section in
the vicinity of each of the disclinations. Further details can be found in Refs. [12, 13, 14]. The data for the largest
T -number (T = 3025; h = 55, k = 0) were ﬁtted to the analytical forms in Eq. (5), with B, D and γb treated as ﬁt
0, 31000] is obtained with
parameters. I have found that the best ﬁt to the numerical results in the region of γ
[13]
B = 1.29, γb = 264, and D = 8.51. These numbers are in good agreement with the results reported in Ref.
(B = 1.27, γb = 260 [19]). The critical Foppl-von K´arm´an number reported in Ref. 12 is twice smaller from the value
found here and in Ref. 13.

The shape geometries obviously converge with the T -number faster than the total energies (compare Figs. 2 and
3). One should note how the buckling transition directly transcribes into increased mean square aspherities of the
minimal energy shapes. The results are very similar to those presented in Ref. [12].

It is of interest to examine how the volume enclosed by the shell changes during the buckling transition. Rough
estimates can be easily obtained. For small Foppl-von K´arm´an numbers, the minimal energy shapes are very nearly
spherical, while for extremely large Foppl-von K´arm´an numbers, the shapes are nearly perfect icosahedra. Assuming
that the shape area is the same in both limits, the volume ratio should be close to

The above expression neglects the elastic strain in the spherical structure and assumes that all the triangular faces
of the mesh have equal areas of a2√3/4, which is of course not true, especially in the regions close to pentagonal
disclinations. Nevertheless, the numerically calculated value of V (γ
0) was found to be only about 0.7 % smaller
from the estimate in Eq. (8). Calculated changes of volume during buckling transitions are presented in Fig. 4.
It can be seen that only about half of the maximum volume reduction predicted by Eq. (7) takes place during the
buckling transition (for 100 < γ < 2000), while the other half of the reduction takes place during the icosahedron’s
ridge sharpening regime (for γ > 106) studied in Refs. [20, 21] and discussed also in Refs. [12, 13].

ICOSAHEDRAL SHELLS WITH THE INCOMPRESSIBLE LIQUID CORE

The picture of a physical system one should keep in mind is that of a formed shell with κ

0 (a sphere) into
which a liquid is poured. The bending modulus of the shell is decreased and the change in energy and shape monitored
during the process. For the constrained shapes, the Foppl-von K´arm´an number is again calculated as in Eq. (3),
although its meaning as the sole parameter that uniquely describes the shell shape [12] is obviously lost. The results
of the calculation of shell energies with and without the enclosed volume constraint are presented in Fig. 5. In the
calculations with the constraint, the volumes were constrained to V = V0 = V (γ

0), and V = V0 = 1.1V (γ

→ ∞

0).

FIG. 5: (Color online) Comparison of shell energies with and without volume conservation constraint as a function of Foppl-von
K´arm´an number for T = 400. Two diﬀerent ﬁxed volumes are studied, V = V0 = V (γ → 0), and V = V0 = 1.1V (γ → 0) as
denoted in the ﬁgure. Very similar behavior is obtained for other T -number studied.

It should be noted that the energies presented correspond only to the energy contained by the shell. For more
realistic application of a shell theory to the viral shapes, one should also include the contribution of the capsid -
DNA/RNA interaction in the total energy. Nevertheless, it can be easily observed from Fig. 5 that the aspherical
shell (viral) shapes become energetically very expensive for Foppl-von K´arm´an numbers larger than about 104 and it
is thus unlikely that shapes characterized by such large Foppl-von K´arm´an numbers will be adopted by viral shells.
This statement is corroborated by the ﬁts of structures of bacteriophage HK97 and L-A yeast virus to the shapes
predicted by Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) which produced values of γ = 1480 and γ = 547, respectively, [12] which are in
the region of κ’s where the volume conservation constraint does not increase the shell energy signiﬁcantly (see Fig.
5). A critique and limitations of this line of thinking and other possible explanations of the buckling transitions are
presented in the next section.

number for T = 400. The two volume constraint studied are the same as in Fig. 5.

Figure 6 displays how the mean square aspherity changes during the buckling transition for the constrained and
unconstrained shapes. Note that the ﬁnal aspherities that are reached through the transition are notably lower in
shapes with the ﬁxed enclosed volume constraint, the more so the larger the ﬁxed volume. The ridge sharpening

6

transition [20, 21] seems to be supressed, at least within the range of parameters studied here. Buckled shapes for
large Foppl-von K´arm´an numbers are shown in Fig. 7. These shapes correspond to points (a), (b), and (c) in Figs. 5
0)
and 6, i.e. they are calculated for the unconstrained case (a), in case when volume is constrained to V0 = V (γ
(b), and V0 = 1.1V (γ
0) (c). The triangular faces in the shapes are colored according to the total energy that
they contain. This was calculated as one half of the energy contained in the three edges of a particular triangle. Note
how the distribution of energy contained in the shell changes depending on whether the enclosed volume conservation
constraint is imposed or not. For unconstrained shells, the largest energy is contained in the vicinity of the pentagonal
disclinations (similar eﬀect was observed in Ref. [23]), while the opposite is observed for the shapes with constrained
volume - in that case the largest energy is contained in the regions between the disclinations that ”bulge out” to satisfy
the volume conservation constraint (see panel c) of Fig. 7). This may have some consequences on bursting of viral
capsids, in particular the points at which the cracks in the capsid initiate [23].

brigher (yellow) triangles correspond to faces with large energy, while those of small total energy are darker (blue).

V. APPLICATION OF THE RESULTS TO VIRAL SHAPES

Pouring a liquid into a spherical elastic shell (immature capsid) will, of course, not change its shape to a more
aspherical one. What ought to happen ”during pouring” (insertion of a genetic material) is a dynamical process that
changes the elastic properties of a capsid, i.e. that eﬀectively increases its Foppl-von K´arm´an number. Only then will a
mature capsid be more aspherical than the precursor capsid. So, the results presented in this article cannot, of course,
provide the full physical description of virus maturation. Nevertheless, if the change of the capsid shape is inﬂuenced
by the fact that the capsid is ﬁlled with the genetic material (in the most trivial sense of ﬁnite volume occupation),
the results should prove useful. The presented results essentially show that if there is a process that increases the
eﬀective Foppl-von K´arm´an number of the capsid, the volume conservation constraint that may be imposed by the
inserted genetic material is not strong enough to destroy the signatures of the buckling transition, and the ”mature”
shell will be more aspherical from its ”precursor” shell, although to lesser amount than could be concluded from the
study of buckling transition in empty shells (see Fig. 6). Now, what could be the process that induced the change of
elastic properties of the viral capsid?

The proposition put forth by Lidmar et al [12] is that the Foppl-von K´arm´an number changes during the maturation
due to the increase of radius (R) and decrease of eﬀective thickness of the protein coating, d. According to Ref. [12],
if one approximates a shell by a uniform isotropic elastic medium of thickness d with the Poisson ratio ν3, then its
eﬀective Foppl-von K´arm´an number should be around

γ = 12(1

3 )(R/d)2.
ν2

(9)

−
If one additionally assumes that the volume of the capsid protein material (not the volume enclosed by the capsid)
remains the same, and that ν3 does not change during maturation, then the Foppl-von K´arm´an numbers before (γB)
630. This
and after (γA) the transition for the HK97 capsid studied in Ref. 12 should be γA = 1480 and γB
indeed predicts a noticeably more spherical shape of the immature capsid. It has been experimentally observed that
the capsid proteins rearrange themselves signiﬁcantly during maturation [22]. To a lesser extent, the reorganization
involves the refolding of the protein itself, but its main consequence is a rearrangement (translations and rotations)
of the proteins to another conﬁguration in which the contacts between capsomers change and the capsomers adopt a
more symmetrical shape which also results in a smoother shape of the capsid. This rearrangement has been studied in
detail for bacteriophage HK97 and P22 capsid in Refs. [16] and [17], respectively. These experimental ﬁndings suggest
that one should study the eﬀects of a change of the lattice constant, a on the shape of the minimum energy shells.
This was done in Fig. 8. The calculations were intentionally performed for small value of T -number (T = 7, which
corresponds to the symmetry of HK97 capsid), although one should keep in mind that the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) was
constructed with the idea of treating the continuous (large T -number) structures for which it makes sense to speak
about elastic moduli of protein sheets, and its predictions for small T -numbers should not be directly transcribed
to viral shapes. Nevertheless, the form in which the Hamiltonian is written [Eq.
(1)] suggests its ”microscopic”
interpretation. These subtleties were discussed in Refs. [12, 13]. The calculations in Fig. 8 were performed for three
values of the lattice constant, a = 1, a = 1.2, a = 1.4, scale of the elastic energy was kept constant (ǫ = 1), and the
bending modulus κ was changed. The mean square aspherities were plotted as a function of κ. The constraint of
ﬁxed enclosed volume was not implemented. Note that in the ”critical” region of values of κ (onset of the buckling

≈

transition), the shapes with very diﬀerent aspherities can be produced by simply changing the lattice parameter a,
and keeping all other parameters of the Hamiltonian ﬁxed (for the shapes plotted in Fig. 8, the bending modulus was
κ = 0.0458). This numerical experiment reproduces the experimental ﬁndings that the i) mature viral shapes enclose
larger volume, and ii) mature viral shapes are more facetted from their precursor shapes. Of course, it still does not
provide any clues with respect to the process that drives the transition to larger lattice constant.

diﬀerent values of the lattice constant a are displayed (a = 1.0 - full line, a = 1.2 - dashed line, and a = 1.4 - dotted line). The
three shapes characterized by these three lattice constants are plotted for κ = 0.0458.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The buckling transition of shells with twelve pentagonal disclinations situated in vertices of an icosahedron was
studied. The constraint of the ﬁxed enclosed volume was introduced and its eﬀect on the shell shapes and energies
explored. It was found that the buckling transition survives this constraint, at least for the enclosed volumes that
are not too large. The buckled shapes are found to be less aspherical than the ones obtained without the volume
constraint. Whether the ﬁxed enclosed volume of the shell is a realistic model of the (mature) viral shells ﬁlled with
the genetic material is, of course, questionable and alternative scenarios for the virus maturation, based again on the
triangulated elastic shells, have been proposed in Sec. V. In any case, the results of this article should be of use in
extending the approaches of Refs. [12, 13] towards more realistic modeling of viral shapes.

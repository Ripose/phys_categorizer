Abstract

In this paper we treat some fractal and statistical features of the DNA sequences. First, a fractal
record model of DNA sequence is proposed by mapping DNA sequences to integer sequences, followed
by R/S analysis of the model and computation of the Hurst exponents. Second, we consider transition
between the four kinds of bases within DNA. The transition matrix analysis of DNA sequences shows that
some measures of complexity based on transition proportion matrix are of interest. The main results are:
1) Hexon > Hintron for virus. But Hintron > Hexon for the species which have the shape of cell except
for drosophila. 2) For Virus, E. coli, yeast, drosophila, mouse and human, measures H of transition
proportion matrix of exon is larger than that of intron, and measures λ, D, C,
C of transition
D and
proportion matrix of intron are larger than that of exon. 3) Regarding the evolution, we ﬁnd that when
e
e
the species goes higher in grade, the measures D, C,
C of exon become larger, the measure H of
exon becomes lesser except for yeast. Hence for species of higher grade, the transition rate among the
e
four kinds of bases goes further from the equilibrium.

Introduction

In the past decade or so there has been a ground swell of interest in unraveling the mysteries of DNA.
In order to distinguish coding regions from non-coding ones, many approaches have been proposed. First,
investigation into nucleotide correlation is of special importance. In recent years many authors have discussed
the correlation properties of nucleotides in DNA sequences[1−9]. C.K. Peng et al[4], using the one-dimensional
DNA walk model found that there exists long-range correlation in non-coding regions but not in coding
regions. Second, the linguistic approach. DNA sequence can be regarded, at a number of levels, as analogous
to mechanisms of processing other kind of languages, such as natural languages and computer languages[10].
R.N. Mantegna et al also studied the linguistic feature of non-coding DNA sequences[11]. Third, the nonlinear
scaling method, such as complexity[12] and fractal analysis[13−17]. Recently, we investigated the correlation

dimension and Kolmogorov entropy of DNA sequences using time series model[18]. Our goal is to search for
a good measure of complexity which can be used to clearly distinguish diﬀerent functional regions of DNA
sequences and to describe the evolution of species.

In this paper, we ﬁrst map DNA sequence to sequence of integer numbers, and treat it like a fractal record
in time, then apply R/S analysis to calculate its Hurst exponent. Second. We analyze DNA sequences with
the transition matrix method and calculate some measures of complexity based on their transition proportion
matrices.

2 R/S analysis

A DNA sequence may also be regarded as a sequence over the alphabet {A, C, G, T }, which represents the
set of the four bases from which DNA is assembled, namely adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. For
any DNA sequence s = s1s2 · · · sN , we deﬁne a map f : s 7→ x = {x1, x2, · · · , xN }, where for any 1 ≤ k ≤ N ,

xk =

−2,
−1,
1,
2,





if sk = A,
if sk = C,
if sk = G,
if sk = T.

According to the deﬁnition of f , the four bases {A, C, G, T } are mapped to four distinct value. One can
also use {−2, −1, 1, 2} to replace {A, G, C, T } or other orders of A, G, C, T . our main aim is distinguish A
and G from purine, C and T from pyrimidine. We expect it to reveal more information than one dimensional
DNA walk[4].

Remark: William Y. C. Chen and J. D. Louck [19] also use the {−2, −1, 1, 2} alphabet for the DNA

sequence, instead of {A, C, G, T }.

Thus we obtain a number sequence x = {xk}N

k=1, where xk ∈ {−2, −1, 1, 2}. This sequence can be
treated as a fractal records in time. To study such sequences, Hurst[20] invented a new statistical method
— the rescaled range analysis (R/S analysis), then B. B. Mandelbrot[21] and J. Feder [22] introduced R/S
analysis of fractal records in time into fractal analysis. For any fractal records in time x = {xk}N
k=1 and any
2 ≤ n ≤ N , one can deﬁne

H is called Hurst exponent.
As n changes from 2 to N , we obtain N − 1 points in ln(n) v.s.

ln(R(n)/S(n)) plane. Then we can
calculate Hurst exponent H of DNA sequence s using the least-square linear ﬁt. As an example, we plot
the graph of R/S analysis of an exon segment s of mouse’ DNA sequence (bp 1730– bp 2650 of the record
with Accession AF033620 in Genbank) in Figure 1.

The Hurst exponent is usually used as a measure of complexity. From Page 149 of Ref.[22], the trajectory
of the record is a curve with a fractal dimension D = 2 − H. Hence a smaller H means a more complex
system. When applied to fractional Brownian motion, if H > 1/2, the system is said to be persistent, which
means that if for a given time period t, the motion is along one direction, then in the succeeding t time, it’s
more likely that the motion will follow the same direction. While for system with H < 1/2, the opposite
holds, that is, antipersistent. But when H = 1/2, the system is Brown motion, and is random.

We randomly choose 17 exons and 34 introns from Virus’ genome; 8 exons and 9 introns from E. coli’s;
22 exons and 22 introns from yeast’s; 30 exons and 24 introns from drosophila’s; 37 exons and 31 introns
from mouse’s; 78 exons and 27 introns from Human’s( all data from Genbank). The Hurst exponent Hs are
calculated for each sequence and averaged according to both species category and function, their relative
standard deviations are also calculated. We list the results in Table 1 (we brieﬂy write “relative standard
deviation” as “RSD” in the following tables).

3 Transition Matrix analysis

Readers can see the concept of Transition Matrix of a data sequence in the book of J.C.Davis[23]. Here
we use this method to study DNA sequences, mainly on the nature of transitions from one kind of base to

another, which presents useful information of the sequence.

For a given DNA sequence s = s1s2 · · · sN , we can construct a 4×4 matrix A = (tij), where tij means the
number of times a given kind of base being succeeded by another in the sequence. A is called the transition
frequency matrix of s, which is a concise way of expressing the incidence of one kind of base following another.
For example, for s = AT AGCGCAT GT ACGCGT AGAT CAT GCT AGCA, the transition frequency matrix
is shown below:

The tendency for one kind of bases to succeed another can be emphasized by converting the frequency
matrix to decimal fractions or percentages. Therefore, we can construct a matrix P = (Pij) by dividing
each element by the grand total of all entries in A. Such a matrix represents the relative frequency of all
the possible types of transitions, and is called the transition proportion matrix of s. For the above example,
the transition proportion matrix is:

First, We calculate the maximum real eigenvalue λ of the transition proportion matrix P of the DNA

sequence. It is natural that such a parameter is relevant to the system’s complexity.

Second, Since

i,j=1 Pij = 1, 0 ≤ Pij ≤ 1, we can view Pij as the probability of one kind of base to
succeed another. If we denote #{Pij : Pij 6= 0} = M be the number of probabilities which is not zero, and
rewrite {Pij : Pij 6= 0} as {Pi}M

When Pi = 1/M, i = 1, 2, · · · , M , i.e. the case of equilibrium state, the function H(P1, · · · , PM ) reaches

its maximum value. When Pi = 1 for some i and Pj = 0 for j 6= i, we have H(P1, · · · , PM ) = 0.

There is also a deﬁnition of disequilibrium D [25], used as a measure of ”complexity” in M -system.

When Pi = 1/M, i = 1, 2, · · · , M , i.e. the case of equilibrium state, the function D = 0. When Pi = 1

for some i and Pj = 0 for j 6= i, D gets its maximum value.

R. Lope-Ruiz et al[26] proposed another statistical measure of complexity C, which is deﬁned as

Now C = 0 for both the equilibrium state and the case of Pi = 1 for some i and Pj = 0 for j 6= i.

4 Conclusions

Virus is species which has not the shape of cell. E. coli belongs to prokaryote and has the shape of cell.
Yeast, drosophila, mouse and human belong to eukaryote and also have the shape of cell. From the point
of view of evolution, virus has lower grade than E. coli; E. coli has lower grade than that of yeast which has
lower grade than that of drosophila; drosophila has lower grade than that of mouse which has lower grade
than that of human. We use Hexon to denote the Hurst exponent of exon, and similarly for other measures
of complexity and functional regions of DNA.

1. From Table 1, we can see that Hexon > Hintron holds for virus, but Hintron > Hexon for the
species which have the shape of cell except for drosophila. The latter means that exons are more complex
than introns. This result coincides with the conclusion of Ref.[12, 14,18]. From Table 1 we also ﬁnd that
the Hurst exponent of DNA sequence is generally larger than 1
2 . This means that when we use fractional
Brownian motion model to describe DNA sequences, we can say it is a persistent system. In particular,
we can see Hexons are diﬀerent from 1/2 explicitly. It indicates that coding regions of DNA is far from
random. This is diﬀerent from the result of Ref.[4] and coincides with the results of Ref.[14]. But we can
not ﬁnd any trend that coincides with the evolution in Table 1.

When we consider the transition of bases in DNA sequence, then
2. For Virus, E. coli, yeast, drosophila, mouse and human, from Table 3, we can conclude that measure
C of
e

H of transition proportion matrix of exon is larger than that of intron, and measures λ, D, C,
transition proportion matrix of intron are larger than that of exon.

D and
e
C of exon
D and
e
e
become larger, the measure H of exon becomes lesser except for yeast. Hence for exon of species of higher
grade, the transition statistics of the four kinds of bases goes further from equilibrium.

3. Regarding the evolution, we ﬁnd that as the grade goes higher, measures D, C,

From the above tables, one can ﬁnd the information entropy H has the less relative standard deviation

than other measures of complexity.

4. From the previous discussions, we ﬁnd that measure H is a good measure of complexity which can
be used to clearly distinguish diﬀerent functional regions of DNA sequences and to describe the evolution
of species.

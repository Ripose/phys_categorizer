We propose the use of a self-oscillating dynamical system –the pre-Galileian clock
equation– for modeling the laryngeal tone. The parameters are shown to be the minimal
control needed for generating the prosody of the human speech. Based on this model, we
outline a peak delay detection algorithm for extracting the prosody of the real speech.

Keywords: Prosody; self-oscillating system; speech.

1. Introduction

One of the distinctive features of the human brain is its aptitude for communicat-
ing thoughts by speaking. In spite of its relevance for exchanging information and
emotions, it is very hard to deal with the system made by the auditory-phonatory
apparatus by means of physical models. The emotional component of verbal com-
munication relies on the fundamental sound of speech –the laryngeal sound– which
is generated by the vocal cords without any movement of mouth or tongue.

The glottal sound has been studied for centuries in the framework of diﬀer-
ent disciplines, and numerous explanations for its unique capability of trasmitting
emotions had been proposed. Among these ideas, one of the most captivating is
Jean-Jacques Rousseau theory about the relation between prosody and music 1. In
his Essai sur l’origine del languages, Chapter XII, he writes:
”La col`ere arrache des cris mena¸cans, que la langue et le palais articulent: mais la
voix de la tendresse est plus douce, c’est la glotte qui la modiﬁe, et cette voix devient
un son; seulement les accens en sont plus fr´equens ou plus rares, les inﬂexions plus
ou moins aigu¨es, selon le sentiment qui s’y joint”.
Later, in the same book, he writes:
”Qu’on fasse la mˆeme question sur la m´elodie, la r´eponse vient d’elle-mˆeme: elle est
d’avance dans l’esprit des lecteurs. La m´elodie, en imitant les inﬂexions de la voix,
exprime les plaintes, les cris de doleur ou de joie, les menaces, les g´emissement;
tous les signes vocaux des passion sont de son ressort. Elle imite les accens des

langues, et les tours aﬀect´es dans chaque idiˆome `a certains mouvemens de l’ame:
elle n’imite pas seulement, elle parle; et son langage inarticul´e, mais vif, ardent,
passionn´e a cent fois plus d’´energie que la parole mˆeme”.

We want to study the relation suggested by Rousseau between musical melodies
and corresponding prosodic patterns, using a simple model for glottal motion. The
laryngeal sound is generated by the cyclic motion of opening and the closing of
vocal cords. At the beginning of the cycle air is pushed by the diaphragm, the vocal
cords are drawn together and air pressure increase, but when the pressure reaches
a critical value it blows the vocal cords apart and ﬂows between them. Then the
vocal cords are then drawn together as a result of the Bernoulli eﬀect 2.

To understand this oscillating behavior “without spring”, we study a simple self-
oscillating model for the pre-Galileian clock 3 which produces a realistic laryngeal
tone. The model can laso be used as a powerful tool for the analysis of glottal sounds.
The results of the analysis can be compared with some adiastematic notation to
suggest a formal correspondence between prosody and music. In this direction it is
possible to suggest that the prosody is the drift of the musical gusto evolution, to
answer to the main question about the nature of stochastic processes which produce
“beautiful” or at least meaningful sequences of sounds 4.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce a non-
linear dynamical system which exhibit all the main features of the glottal cycle. In
section 3 the parameters of the system are used as time dependent controls for the
glottis, and in the following we present an algorithm for analyzing the control of
the recorded sounds. The form of this control suggest also a delay-line-like behavior
for the cochlear apparatus.

2. The cycle of the glottis.

The laryngeal tone is the oscillatory variation in air pressure generated by the
cyclic movement of the vocal cords. At the beginning of each cycle 5 the vocal
cords are held together by the action of the arytenoid cartilages. Air is forced into
the trachea and when the pressure exceeds a threshold (the value of which depends
on the strength of the vocal cords), it opens the vocal cords and ﬂows through
the glottis. Inside the constricted laryngeal passage air pressure falls (its velocity
increase) giving rise, for the Bernoulli principle, to the pressure drop closing the
vocal cords and completing the cycle. The cycle repeats at rates of 130-220 times
per second. The ear perceives the variation in the cycle period as changes in the
pitch.

The valve-like behavior producing the laryngeal tone is characteristic of self-
oscillating systems. A self-oscillating system is an apparatus which produces a pe-
riodic process at the expense of a non-periodic source of energy. Self-oscillations do
not depend on the initial condition but are determined by the properties of the sys-
tem itself. Examples of self-oscillating systems include the electric bell, saw-tooth
signal generators as well as wind and string musical instruments 3.

The prosody and the music of the human speech

Several realistic models for the glottal behavior have been proposed over the
years starting with the celebrated “two-mass model” 6,7,8,9. We will now present
a minimal mechanism thet exibits all the main features of glottal behavior. In
particular we want to make explicit both the dependence of the oscillation period
on the forces acting on the system, and the features of the trigger mechanism
producing the self-oscillations.

Let s ∈ [−1, 1] the variable related to the aperture of the glottis: in the extreme
positions s = −1 indicates that the glottis is completely closed and s = 1 that
the vocal cords are open. We represent s in the [−1, 1] interval in agreement with
the usual representation of the acoustic signals. Assuming that the laringeal tone
is proportional to the opening, s can be assimilated to the signal itself

[T0, T1] ∋ t → s(t) ∈ [−1, 1]

(1)

where [T0, T1] is a time interval. For simplicity we assume that the forces act on
the glottis istantaneously: for s(t) ≥ +s0 the Bernoulli eﬀect produce a force which
closes the glottis, for s(t) ≤ −s0 the pressure opens the glottis, and for −s0 <
s(t) < +s0 no force is acting on the glottis. This approximation is useful for solving
the model, but can be easily relaxed in computer simulations. When the glottis is
opening, the force P (s) acting on it is negative and when it is closing P (s) > 0.
Therefore over the interval −s < s < +s the force P = P (s) is a twovalued
function of the variable s representing the opening of the glottis. Following the
Andronov argument 3 P (s) imposes limitations on the shape of the phase plane
trajectories, since assigning (s, ˙s) does not uniquely determines the state of the
system where −s0 < s < s0 . Instead we have to use a phase surface with two
half-planes superimposed: (a) s < s0 and (b) s > −s0. The points on this two-
sheet phase surface have a one to one correspondence with the states of the system,
the passage of the representative point from sheet (a) to the sheet (b) occurs for
s = +s0, the reverse passage for s = −s0, and the abscissa remains unvaried in
both the cases.

To further semplify the model we assume that the force P (s) applied to the
glottis by the air pressure is constant in absolute value: P (s) = +P0 for the closing
and P (s) = −P0 for the opening. To model the vocal cords tension we introduce the
constant resistence f0, which does not depend on the position of the glottis. On the
basis of these simple assumptions it is possible to describe two diﬀerent laringeal
sounds. The ﬁrst one, that we call prosody, does not have a natural period because
there is no elastic force contributing to the movement of the vocal cords. This system
does not exhibit high stability and is therefore a good model for cases in which the
period of oscillation has to be sensitive to variations in control parameters. The
second type has a natural period due to the elastic term, and in absence of feeding
can perform damped oscillations. This model can be used to describe singing, but
is out of the scope of this paper.

The dynamic equation for the model without the elastic force is

m¨s = f (s, ˙s) + P (s)

(2)

where m is the glottis mass, P = P (s) the force produced by air pressure on it and
f (s, ˙s) is the resistence of the vocal cords. If we assume f (s, ˙s) = −f0 sign( ˙s) during
the motion ( ˙s 6= 0), equation (2) becomes

Introducing the variables x = s/s0 and z = +
rewritten as

p

P0/ms0t, equation (3) can be

m¨s = −f0 sign( ˙s) ± P0

˙x = y
˙y = −F sign(y) − (−1)n

(cid:26)

where the dot operator is now the derivative with respect to the scaled time z,
y 6= 0, F = f0/P0 and n is even when the glottis is closing and odd when the glottis
is opening. If the air pressure outside the glottis is a linear funcion of the glottis
aperture, the x variable can be studied as the waveform of the laryngeal tone.

If F ≥ 1 and the glottis is at rest (y = 0) the force produced by the air pressure
can not open the vocal cords, ˙y = 0 and the point (x, 0) is the equilibrium state.
Therefore, for the case when f0 < P0 the system has no states of equilibrium. From
equation (4) we have for the (a) half plane (x < +1 and P = −P0)

dy
dx

=

1 − F sign(y)

and integrating we have y2/2 − (1 + F )x = k for y < 0 and y2/2 − (1 − F )x = k for
y > 0, k = const, so that the phase path on the sheet (a) is made by two parabolae
and the representative point moves to the left on the lower half of the sheet (y < 0)
and to the right on the upper one. All the phase paths on sheet (a) reach their
boundaries on the semiaxis x = +1, y > 0, and the phase paths on sheet (b) are
symmetrical with respect to the origin of the coordinates.

Following the Andronov treatment 3 we draw the two axes v where x = −1,
y = −v < 0 and v′ where x = 1, y = v′ > 0 and consider the sequence of
the points of intersections with them of an arbitrary phase path: v, v1, v2, v3, . . ..
The representative point pass at the point (−1, −v) from sheet (b) to sheet (a)
and reach the axis of the abscissa at the point (−ξ, 0), where ξ is given by the
equation v2 = 2(1 + F )(ξ − 1). Then the representative point moves on the upper
half of the sheet (a) and reaches its boundary at (+1, v1) where v1 is given by
v2
1 = 2(1−F )(ξ +1). The phase path on (a) establishes a one-to-one correspondence
between the points of the axes v and v′, a point transformation where the sequence
function is parametrized by the peak ξ of the laryngeal tone. Then the representative
point passes on the sheet (b) and reaches the semi-axis v on (−1, −v2), where v2
is determined by the same sequence (due to the symmetry of the sheets (a) and
(b)) and the point transformation of v′ in v is the same of v in v′. The ﬁxed point
v = v1 = ¯v, corresponding to a symmetric limit cycle, is given by the equation
(1 + F )( ¯ξ − 1) = (1 − F )( ¯ξ + 1) and is determined by the glottal peak

(on the right), where the two sheets are glued together and the vocal cords resistence is diﬀerent
for the opening and the closing. The value of s has been scaled to ﬁt in the [−1, 1] interval.

If we assume that the vocal cords resistence is not the same for the opening
and closing glottis, the equation (4) gives the signal of ﬁgure 1. The corresponding
sound is very similar to the sound obtained by placing a microphone on the throat
and directly recording the glottal sound.

3. The prosodic patterns of the controlled glottis

The stability of equations (3) can be evaluated by the ratios of the percentage
variation of the period to the percentage variation of the two parameters, and
shows to be very small 3. Because of this low stability, the system is not suitable
for building clocks. However its sensitivity to variation in the parameters and the
fast convergence to the limit cycle, make it a suitable model for a controlled glottis.
Let us suppose that the air pressure and the strength of the vocal cords are
controlled by the speaker. Controlling P (t) and f (t) it is possible to change the
amplitude (6) and the period (7) of the laryngeal tone to produce the prosodic
patterns conveying the non semantic aspect of the speech.

In order to decode the prosodic pattern we neet to know the time evolution of

In other wordss we suggest that when the cochlea decode the prosody of the speech
it needs only to detect the value of ¯ξ and the time delay of ¯ξ with respect to
the previous one. This stands in agreement with recent studies about the delay
lines inside the cochlea 10. Therefore the system can be controlled by a piecewise
constant function which changes the period and the amplitude. If we choose a

We observe also that the characteristic time of the control change is larger than
the period of the wave, in agreement with studies comparing of the laryngeal tone
period with the muscular control time 2. Therefore we state that the prosodic
information is all contained in C and that in order to decode the prosodic pattern
the listener needs to decode the C function.

4. Perception of the laryngeal tone

The dynamical system given by equation (4) can be used to detect and represent
the prosody of real speech. To accomplish this we only need to know the discrete
function

[T0, T1] ∋ t → ¯ξ(t) ∈ [0, 1]

(9)

Even though the sound of (9) is diﬀerent from the fundamental sound (1), their
prosody is identical. Moreover during the speech process the time interval between
two consecutive ¯ξ is changed countinuously to produce the prosodic meaning.

The ¯ξ(t) function can be extracted from a recorded sound by means of the
simple procedure of sliding a temporal ﬁxed window on the signal, and selecting for
each window the value of s(t) not exceeded backward and forward 11. The resulting
signal is shown in ﬁgure 4 on the left.

In order to obtain the control C function we have to know the T (t) value also.
To do this we plot the delay of each peak ¯ξ(τi) with respect to the previous one
¯ξ(τi−1) as funtion of time (ﬁgure 4 right) where τ1, τ2, . . . , τN are the times where
¯ξ(t) is non zero.

the time.

In this way it is possible to construct a map of the control C and therefore to
decode the prosody of the speech. The amplitude and the delay of ¯ξ are the only
information needed. The control function represented in ﬁgure 2 can be obtained
by the data represented in ﬁgure 4 via the equations (6) and (7). If we take the
fundamental given by the Fast Fourier Transform of s(t) we obtain a rough map of
C because the FFT needs some cycles to detect the period.

When applied to the real speech, the “peak detection” yelds maps which re-
semble the neumatic notation of the gregorian chant. This is not surprising given
that during the middle age the rules of the correspondence between text and the
music where very strict, and the composer had to put the known melodies together
rather then inventing anything new ones 12. Following the ideas of Rousseau, the
algorithm proposed for the analysis and the synthesis of the laringeal tone can be a

comparison of the contol maps with the adiastematic notation system 11.

5. Conclusion

Although it is still not clear how the proposed system is related to the ﬂuidodynam-
ics of the glottis, the self-oscillating system used to model the laryngeal behavior
is very simple and exhibits good agreement with the main features of the glottal
sounds. It produces a realistic laryngeal sound an can be used to extract the prosody
from a recorded sound. Its main features, shared with many “natural” oscillators
is the lacking of the elastic term. The control of this system suggests also that the
cochlear behavior is related to delay line detection. The equation is very simple
to simulate in real time on a computer, and can be used for generating prosodic
patterns or for manipulating the prosodic meaning of recorded sentencces.

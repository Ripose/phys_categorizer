Abstract. Autonomous oscillations in biological systems may have a biochemical
origin or result from an interplay between force-generating and visco-elastic elements.
In molecular motor assemblies the force-generating elements are molecular engines
and the visco-elastic elements are stiﬀ cytoskeletal polymers. The physical mechanism
leading to oscillations depends on the particular architecture of the assembly. Existing
models can be grouped into two distinct categories: systems with a delayed force
activation and anomalous force-velocity relations. We discuss these systems within
phase plane analysis known from the theory of dynamic systems and by adopting
methods from control theory, the Nyquist criterion.

Oscillations in molecular motor assemblies

1. Introduction

Oscillations are ubiquitous in biological systems. Examples range from circadian
rhythms associated with external periodicities to autonomous bio-chemical [31] and
mechano-chemical oscillators. Voltage oscillations in systems of ion channels embedded
in a cell membrane are one of the most prominent examples for a biochemical oscillator.
At the heart of its explanation within the Hodgkin-Huxley model [19] there is a negative
diﬀerential current-voltage relation for the ion channels. Here our focus are mechano-
chemical systems composed of visco-elastic biopolymer arrays and active molecular
machines driven by the chemical cycle of ATP hydrolysis. We ask how the interplay
between force-generation and energy-input by the molecular motors and the restoring
forces and damping mechanisms provided by the biopolymer system may lead to
oscillatory behavior.

There are many examples of functional units in cellular systems whose main
components are molecular machines and visco-elastic elements. The part list of auditory
hair bundles contains stereocilia (elastic rods composed of bundles of stiﬀ biopolymers F-
actin), myosin (a force-generating molecular motor) and mechanosensitive ion-channels.
Spontaneous oscillations in such systems are by now well documented experimentally [27]
and explained within simple theoretical models [10, 42]. This oscillatory behavior of hair
bundles provides a mechanism for active ampliﬁcation of acoustic signals [7]. Another
example are axonemal cilia and ﬂagella which are used by many small organisms to
swim. Here the main structural element are axonemes, which consist of a cylindrical
arrangement of elastically linked microtubules (another example for a stiﬀ biopolymer)
and an assembly of dynein motors located between neighboring microtubules. Forces
generated by the dynein motors induce relative sliding between microtubules which in
turn results into bending of the axonemes [5]. Oscillatory behavior in such systems is
generic and originates from a Hopf bifurcation [8]. Sarcomeres, the contractile units of
muscles, are composed of two sets of protein ﬁlaments: myosin ﬁlaments (containing
myosin motors) and actin ﬁlaments. The shortening of the sarcomere is achieved by
the actin and myosin ﬁlaments sliding over one another. While the primary function
of most types of muscle is to generate a unidirectional force, some muscle (notably the
asynchronous, also known as ﬁbrillar or myogenic insect ﬂight muscle) are specialized
on autonomous oscillatory contraction. The oscillation mechanism usually includes a
number of regulatory proteins that constitute the delayed stretch-activation mechanism.
However, oscillations were also observed in skeletal muscle ﬁbrils, mostly under non-
physiological conditions [32]. Theoretical studies show that even skeletal muscle myosin
could produce oscillatory motion [14, 13, 40], which is normally not observable because
the contributions of diﬀerent sarcomeres cancel out. However, a sudden change in
applied load can lead to synchronization of sarcomeres and the oscillations become
observable for a certain period of time [15]. Assemblies of molecular motors and stiﬀ
biopolymers also play an essential role during cell division. The duplicated genome is
segregated into two daughter cells through the action of the mitotic spindle. It consists

of ﬁbres (microtubule bundles) radiating from two poles and meeting at the equator in
the middle. The spindle poles have been found to oscillate [16]. Recently it has been
shown that these oscillations are again due to an interplay between force-generating and
elastic elements [17].

Here we will focus on a discussion of the generic features of oscillations in molecular
motor assemblies to highlight the common physical mechanisms. For more system
speciﬁc and detailed discussions we refer the reader to the literature. The deﬁning
elements of molecular motor assemblies are:
(i) an external energy source driving
the system towards a non-equilibrium steady state, (ii) viscoelastic elements providing
restoring forces and damping mechanisms, (iii) possibly force-dependent biochemical
reactions which allow for switching between diﬀerent states of the molecular motor
assembly. The particular interconnection between these components gives rise to the
system response which may be controlled by the biochemical reaction rates. Deﬁned as
such there are obvious analogies to system and control theory which is a well established
In particular, linear system analysis is a most fruitful
discipline in engineering [12].
concepts which we will also employ to characterize the system’s dynamic response.

The mechanisms for oscillations in chemochemical models discussed in the literature
can be grouped into two distinct categories. In delayed force activation systems an active
component (molecular motor) generates a displacement x which induces a force f with
some delay time τ (Debye relaxator). As such the system would evolve towards a time-
independent steady state. Oscillatory response is achieved only after coupling the Debye
relaxator to other dynamic elements with either a negative stiﬀness or some inertial
(massive) load. Anomalous force-velocity relations are an alternative route towards
oscillatory behavior. This means that an assembly of motors can move with two diﬀerent
velocities (e.g., one positive and one negative) under the same load [35]. If attached to an
external spring, the motors will move forwards until the spring force exceeds a certain
threshold, then they will switch to the other stable state and slide backwards, until
another threshold is reached and so the cycle repeats [24].

2. Response Functions

To assess the stability of an active mechanical system like an insect muscle attached to
the wing or the dynein motor acting between two tubulin ﬁlaments in a ﬂagellum, the
response function can be deﬁned the following way. We connect the active system to a
mechanical actuator that keeps its length at the desired point of operation and at the
same time imposes small oscillations with the amplitude x0 around that point

Fur suﬃciently small oscillations the system responds with a force that oscillates with
the same frequency

∆x(t) = ℜx0eiωt .

h∆f (t)i = ℜf0eiωt .

Oscillations in molecular motor assemblies

Here hi denote an ensemble average over diﬀerent realizations of the response of the
stochastic system. Note that the sign in the exponent of the Fourier transform was
chosen in the way that is most common in the literature on muscle, although it is
opposite to the convention frequently used in physics. We deﬁne the force in the way
that it is positive if the motor system is being pulled upon in the direction of positive
x. In the limit of small amplitude x0, the relation becomes linear

f0 = G(ω)x0 .

with the frequency dependent response function or modulus G(ω). Here the real part
of G corresponds to the elastic and the imaginary part to the dissipative response. For
a spring with a spring constant k the response function is G(ω) = k and for a damping
element (“dashpot”) G(ω) = iωγ.

One may also encounter a situation where for a given force f one is observing the

displacement x for various realizations of the system response,

The two response functions become equivalent

hx(ω)i = χ(ω) f (ω) .

χ(ω) = 1/G(ω)

if the following two conditions are fulﬁlled. First, the system needs to be stable, so that
the operational point is the same regardless whether the position or the force is imposed.
Second, the systems are large enough such that variance of the stochastic variable is
small compared to its mean.

3. The Nyquist stability criterion

The Nyquist stability criterion is a convenient tool to analyze the stability of a dynamical
system if the complex response function G(ω) is known over the whole frequency range.
It states that the system is dynamically unstable if the plot of ℑG(ω) vs. ℜG(ω)
(Nyquist plot, sometimes also called Cole-Cole plot) encircles the coordinate origin in
clockwise direction.
It is frequently used in engineering, especially for the stability
analysis of closed feedback loops in electrical circuits[12].

To derive it we ﬁrst note that the system is dynamically unstable if there exists an
eigenmode, i.e. a solution of the equation hF (x0, ω)i = 0 with ℑω < 0, since then the
corresponding solution x(t) obviously diverges for t → +∞. This means that G(ω) has
a zero and χ(ω) has a pole in the lower half-plane with ℑω < 0. The Nyquist criterion
is based on the fact that G(ω) is an analytical complex function and utilizes Cauchy’s
theorem to relate the number of zeros in the negative imaginary ω half-plane to the
contour of G(ω), evaluated for real values of ω.

According to Cauchy’s theorem, the change of phase along a closed contour in

clockwise direction in the complex ω plane equals

where Nz is the number of encircled zeros of G(ω), Np the number of poles and nz,k
and np,k their multiplicities. Because of causality, G vanishes for ℑω → −∞ and we
can close the path in the negative imaginary plane (Fig. 1a). We further note that in a
real system G(ω) has no poles in the negative imaginary half-plane, because they would
imply an inﬁnite force response to a ﬁnite displacement. Therefore, any phase change
along a closed path indicates a zero with ℑω < 0, and therefore a dynamical instability.

ω as a parameter. The points denoted as A,B and C correspond to a negative, 0 and
a positive value of ω. The curve shown has a typical shape measured on insect ﬂight
muscle [26].

Now we can look at the same path in the G plane. The strand along the real ω
axis corresponds to the (ℜG(ω), ℑG(ω)) curve, with ω as a parameter that takes values
−∞ to ∞. In case G(−∞) 6= G(∞), we close the path in the positive real half-plane

(Fig. 1b). From (6) it follows that this curve encircles the coordinate origin
times in clockwise direction. Note that the curve is symmetric with respect to the real
axis. Because G(t) is a real function, its Fourier transformed has to fulﬁll the following
symmetry relation:

P

G(−ω∗) = G∗(ω) .

(7)

An additional consequence of the Nyquist criterion is that the origin can only be
encircled in clockwise direction, because G contains zeros but no poles in the relevant
region.

4. Delayed force activation

One type of models, often used to explain oscillations generated by molecular motors
involves a delayed force activation mechanism. This means that when the system is

Oscillations in molecular motor assemblies

displaced by the distance x in one direction, it develops a restoring force f , however not
instantaneously, but according to a diﬀerential equation like:

6

(8)

df
dt

= (KAx − f )/τ .

Here τ represents the time constant with which the force reacts to a position change
and KA an eﬀective steady state stiﬀness of the active system. There are many diﬀerent
physical mechanisms that can produce a delayed force response:

(i) Stretch-activation of

insect ﬂight muscle:

a number of regulatory proteins
facilitate the activation of myosin motors following a mechanical stretch (a relative
displacement of thin ﬁlaments relative to thick) [33, 11, 1]. After the activation,
the development of force does not follow instantaneously, but with a certain time
constant, typically with the attachment rate of motors.

(ii) In a sarcomere a position change can bring myosin heads closer to the accessible
actin sites [39, 38]. This mechanism has been proposed for insect ﬂight muscle [44],
although experiments have refuted it in many cases [36].

(iii) The switching of bound myosin heads between two conformations with diﬀerent
detachment rates can lead to an eﬀective stretch-dependent activation [40, 9].

(iv) The opening of a mechanically gated ion channel can cause the inﬂux of calcium
ions, which then promote channel reclosure. This is called the fast adaptation
mechanism in auditory hair cells and can generate spontaneous hair bundle
oscillations [34, 20, 10, 42]. If the hair cell is on the verge of spontaneous oscillations
(i.e., close to a Hopf bifurcation) it has the best sensitivity, dynamic range and
frequency selectivity [7].

(v) Calcium ions, entering the ion channel, can reduce the force generated by adaptation
motors of type myosin 1C [3], a mechanism known as slow adaptation in auditory
hair cells [21, 29, 28].

(vi) Some models for ﬂagellar dynein are based on a strain-controlled [25] or curvature-

controlled [5] activation.

The solution of (8) can be expressed with a Greens function GA(t), so that

f (t) =

GA(t − t′)x(t′)dt′

with

GA(t) =

Such behavior is well known from many branches in physics under the term Debye

is represented by a circle in a Nyquist plot (see Fig. 3 (a)). It does have a negative
imaginary part, however, the real part is always positive. Hence the Nyquist plot of
GA(ω) cannot encircle the coordinate origin and thereby satisfy the Nyquist criterion for
an instability. The stationary state of the Debye relaxator simply is a time-independent
displacement x⋆ = f /KA. Note, that a dynamics with a one-dimensional phase space,

Figure 2. Diﬀerent biological mechanism that lead to delayed force activation:
i) Stretch activation in insect ﬂight muscle, after Ref.[30]. The applied stretch
activates myosin mechanically through conformational changes involving ﬂightin, GST-
2, troponin-H and tropomyosin. ii) The alternative match-mismatch mechanism, where
the myosin heads are activated when they are brought to appropriate positions along
the actin helix. iii) The mechanism involving switching of myosin heads between two
bound conformations. A stretch brings more myosin heads into the pre-powerstroke
state, which is less likely to detach from actin, and therefore the total number of

active heads increases[40].
When the transduction channel opens, calcium ions enter and promote the reclosure
of the channel. v) The slow adaptation mechanism in auditory hair cells: calcium ions
entering the cells reduce the force generated by myosin motors, therefore they slip back
and the channel is more likely to close again.

i.e. ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations of the form df /dt = x(f ), is either monotonic of
constant[37]. Only if the dynamic variable is on a circle or if the phase space has more
than two dimensions oscillations emerge as possible solutions.

One way to make the system unstable, is to connect the active mechanism with
an element that shifts the Nyquist plot towards negative values on the real axis; for an
illustration of the type of connection see Fig. 3. This can be trivially achieved through
an element with a negative eﬀective stiﬀness, or, as we will show below, through an
inertial load.

Negative stiﬀness can be generated by the gating compliance of ion channels [22, 29],
by motors switching between two states [18, 40]. Inertial load is the likely mechanism
of ensuring an instability in insect ﬂight muscle [41]. Also in many types of hair cells,
no negative stiﬀness has been observed, but as the hair bundle is often attached to the
tectorial membrane, inertial load could play an important role as well [2].

5. Anomalous force-velocity relations

A class of models that were frequently discussed in relation to dynamical instabilities in
systems of molecular motors is based on an anomalous force-velocity relation, meaning
that a group of coupled motors produces a force that displays a region with negative
slope as a function of velocity. Models for dynein [6], myosin [43], propulsion by actin
polymerization [4], mitotic spindle oscillations [17] as well as generic motors [23, 24]
were based on this mechanism.

A common feature of such models is translational invariance, meaning that the
force f (t) does not depend on the position x, but only on the velocity v and the history
thereof. The translational invariance can be achieved even on periodic tracks (like
actin ﬁlaments) if the motors (myosin heads) are arranged incommensurate to the track
periodicity [23].

An instructive example of a system displaying an anomalous force-velocity relation
In this model, motors can

attach to actin in a forward-leaning position with rate ra, then quickly undergo a
conformational change, which makes them strained. When the ﬁlaments moves, this
strain changes with time (for forward-running motors, it decreases), and when the motor
eventually detaches with a strain-dependent rate rd(ξ) the cycle can repeat. Each motor
generates a force kξ, proportional to its strain. A full description of this system requires
Master equations for the probability of a motor for being in the detached state (Φd)
and for the probability density of a motor for being in the attached state with strain ξ
(Φa(ξ)).

features of this model we neglect the strain-
dependence of the attachment probability and assume that all attached motors have
the same strain y(t),

To illustrate the key physical

Φd(ξ, t) = n(t) δ(ξ − y(t)) .

Then the number of attached motors n(t) is related to the number of detached motors
by Φd(t) = N − n(t). Upon inserting these relations into Eqs.14a,b , multiplying Eq.14a
with ξ and integrating over all values of ξ one obtains a simpliﬁed set of dynamic
equations for y(t) and n(t):

˙y = [d − y]

ra − v

N − n
n

˙n = [N − n]ra − nrd(y)

f = −nky

The external force on the system, which equals the total force produced by the motors,
is given as

where k denotes the spring constant of each motor. These are nonlinear ﬂow equations
with a two-dimensional phase space consisting of the strain y(t) and the number density
n(t) of the attached motors. For a constant velocity v, they always have a stable
stationary solution. However, if we take the system consisting of the group of motors,
coupled to an external spring with a spring constant K, so that f + Kx = 0, we obtain
a new system of two nonlinear equations for two independent variables (e.g., x and n).
Depending on the parameter values, they can have a stable ﬁxed point or a limit cycle
(oscillatory steady state). These two examples are shown in Fig. 4.

In the following we will again use the stability analysis of linear response functions
to characterize the system. In the absence of an external velocity (v = 0), Eqs. 16a,b
have a stable stationary solution with y0 = d and n0 = ra
ra+rd(d) N. For small values of v
we can linearize the ﬂow equations to

˙y = − rd(d)∆y − v
˙n = − n0r′

d(d)∆y − (ra + rd(d))∆n

where ∆y = y − y0 and ∆n = n − n0. These equations have two negative eigenvalues,
−λ1 = −rd(d) and −λ2 = −ra − rd(d). The solution of the coupled system then has the

In the limit ω → ∞, the response is always that of the elastic elements involved,

and an anomalous force-velocity relation. In case of an anomalous force velocity relation
the curve encircles the origin and the system is dynamically unstable.

If the assembly of motors is coupled to an elastic element (spring constant K), the
curve in the Nyquist plot is shifted to the right by the amount K. There is a critical
value of K at which the oscillations stop. In the example shown in Fig. 4, this value
would lie between those used in both diagrams. At the transition point the system
exhibits a Hopf bifurcation [24, 17].

In summary, based on the foregoing discussion, we feel that a combination of
methods from the engineering sciences like control theory and methods from the theory

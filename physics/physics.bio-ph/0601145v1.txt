Because of growing interest in temperature-based sampling methods like
replica exchange [1–7], this note aims to make some observations and raise
some potentially important questions which we have not seen addressed suf-
ﬁciently in the literature. Mainly, we wish to call attention to limits on the
maximum speed-up to be expected from temperature-based methods, and
also note the need for careful quantiﬁcation of sampling eﬃciency. Because
potentially lengthy studies may be necessary to address these issues, we felt
it would be useful to bring them to the attention of the broader community.
Here we are strictly concerned with canonical sampling at a ﬁxed temperature,
and not with conformational search.

We will base our discussion around a generic replica exchange protocol,
consisting of M levels spanning from the temperature T0 at which canonical
sampling is desired, up to TM . The protocol is motivated by the increased
rate of barrier crossing possible at higher temperatures. We assume each level
is simulated for a time tsim, which implies a total CPU cost (M + 1) × tsim.
In typical explicitly solvated peptide systems, M ∼ 20, T0 ≃ 300K and
TM ∼ 450K [3] [check temp]. The relatively low TM values reﬂect the well-
known, high sensitivity of the approach to conﬁguration-space overlap in
large systems [2, 3]: that is, because of minimal overlap, typical conﬁgurations
in high T Boltzmann ensembles are unlikely in low T enembles. We note that
a new exchange variant introduced by Berne and coworkers permits the use
of “cold” solvent and larger temperature gaps [8], but the issues we raise still
apply to the new protocol, especially as larger solutes are considered.

While replica exchange is often thought of as an ’enhanced sampling
method,’ what does that mean? Indeed, what is an appropriate criterion
for judging eﬃciency? As our ﬁrst observation, we believe (Obs. I) eﬃ-
ciency can only mean a decrease in the total CPU usage — i.e., summed
over all processors — for a given degree of sampling quality. (We will defer
the necessary discussion of assessing sampling quality, and only assume such
assessment is possible.) When the goal is canonical sampling at T0, after
all, one has the option of running an ordinary parallel simulation at T0 (e.g.,
[namd]) or even M independent simulations [9]. A truly eﬃcient method
must be a superior alternative to such “brute force” simulation.

(Obs. II) Reports in the literature oﬀer an ambiguous picture as to
whether replica exchange attains eﬃciency for canonical sampling. Sanbon-
matsu and Garcia compared replica exchange to an equivalent amount of
brute-force sampling, but their claim of eﬃciency is largely based on the
alternative goal of enhancing sampling over the full range of temperatures,

1

rather than for canonical sampling at T0 [3]. When the data solely for T0
are examined, there is no clear gain, especially noting that assessment was
based on principal components derived only from the replica exchange data.
Another claim of eﬃciency, by Duan and coworkers [7], fails to include the
full CPU cost of all M levels. When suitably corrected, there does appear
to be speedup of perhaps a factor of two for T0 = 308K, but the system
studied is considerably smaller (permitting larger temperature jumps) than
would be possible in protein systems of interest. Another eﬃciency claim by
Roe et al. also does not account for the full CPU cost of all ladder levels [6].
In a structural-glass system, replica exchange was found not to be helpful
[10], although eﬃciency has been noted in spin-systems [1, 11]. We emphasize
that biomolecular replica exchange should indeed be eﬃcient in certain cases
(with high enough energy barriers; see below). At least one such instance
has been noted by Garcia, using a suitable brute-force comparison system
[12].

The lack of clear-cut results in a much-heralded approach merit closer
examination. What might be preventing eﬃciency gain? Or put another
way, what is the maximum eﬃciency possible in a standard replica exchange
simulation? The very construction of the method implies that (Obs. III) in
any parallel exchange protocol, the sampling “speed” at the bottom level —
lowest T — will be controlled by the speed at which the top level — highest
T — samples the necessary space. Further, given our interest in eﬃcient
canonical sampling at T0, the speed of the top level should exceed that of
the bottom by at least a factor of M. If not, the simulation does not “break
even” in total CPU cost, as compared to brute-force canonical sampling at
T0 for the full length M × tsim.

The basic temperature dependence of barrier-crossing is well known (e.g.,
[13]) and has important consequences for replica exchange. The Arrhenius
factor indicates that the temperature-dependent rate k for crossing a partic-
ular barrier obeys

ka(T ) = k0 exp (+∆S/kB) exp (−∆E/kBT )

(1)

for a ﬁxed-volume system, where k0 is an unknown prefactor insensitive to
temperature and assumed constant; ∆E is the energy barrier and ∆S is the
entropy barrier — i.e., ”narrowing” of conﬁguration space — which must
be expected in a multi-dimensional molecular system. Two observations are
immediate: (Obs. IV) the entropic component of the rate is completely

2

unaﬀected by an increase in temperature, and the possible speedup due to
the energetic part can easily be calculated.

The table gives possible speedups for several energy barriers and temper-
atures, employing units of kBT0 for T0 = 300K. Speed-ups are computed
simply as the ratio ka(TM )/ka(T0) for possible values of TM . It is clear that
for modest barriers, the speed-up attainable even with a top temperature
TM = 500K is only of the order of a typical number of replicas in replica ex-
change, M ∼ 20. Thus, (Obs. V) if modest barriers (< 8kBT0) dominate a
system’s dynamics, eﬃciency will be diﬃcult to obtain via replica exchange,
since the speed-up noted in the table needs to be divided by M + 1.

How high are barriers encountered in molecular systems? We can only
begin to answer this question, but one must ﬁrst be careful about which
barriers matter. We believe that (Obs. VI) “local” barriers will matter most:
that is, the energy barriers actually encountered in a trajectory will dominate
sampling speed. Apparent barriers determined by projections onto arbitrary
low-dimensional reaction coordinates would seem of uncertain value. (We
note that Zwanzig has attempted to account for local roughness with an
eﬀective diﬀusion constant on a slowly varying landscape [14].)

Evidence from simulations and experiments is far from complete, but
indicates that (Obs. VII) energy barriers in molecular systems appear to
be modest. Here, unless noted otherwise, T0 ≃ 300K.
In their extensive
study of a tetrapeptide, Czerminski and Elber found barriers < 3 kcal/mole
≃ 5kBT0 for the lowest energy transition path [15]. Equally interesting,
they found approximately 1,000 additional paths with similar energy proﬁles
(diﬀering by < 1 kcal/mole < 2kBT0) — suggesting what we might term a
“pebbly” rather than “mountainous” energy landscape. See also Ref. [16].
In our own work (unpublished) with implicitly solvated dileucine, increasing
the temperature from 298K to 500K led to a hopping-rate increase of a
factor of 1.8, suggesting a small barrier (< 1.5kBT0). Similarly, Sanbonmatsu
and Garcia found that barriers for explicitly solvated met-enkephalin were
small, on the order of kBT0 [3]. An experimental study has also suggested
barriers are modest (< 6kBT0) [17]. Although this list is fairly compelling,
we believe the question of barrier heights is far from settled. Further study
should carefully consider local vs. global barriers, as well as entropy vs. energy
components of barriers. (We purposely do not discuss barriers to protein
folding, because our scope here is solely equilibrium ﬂuctuations.)

Finally, the goal of understanding eﬃciency implies the need for reliable
means for assessing sampling. An ideal approach to assessment would survey

3

all pertinent substates to ensure appropriate Boltzmann frequencies. Present
approaches to assessment typically calculate free energy surfaces (equiva-
lently, probability distributions) on one or two-dimensional surfaces, which
are evaluated visually. Principal components (e.g., [3, 7]) as well as “compos-
ite” coordinates like the radius of gyration [6] are popular coordinate choices.
Yet we believe that (Obs. VIII) the use of low-dimensional sampling assess-
ment is intrinsically limited, since it could readily mask structural diversity
— i.e., be consistent with substantially distinct conformational ensembles.
Future work could usefully pursue higher-dimensional measures, which can
always be numerically compared between independent simulations for sam-
In our own work, for instance, we have begun to use a

histogram measure which directly reports on the structural distribution of
an ensemble [18].

In conclusion, we have attempted to tie together a number of straight-
forward observations which reﬂect concerns about the eﬀectiveness of the
replica exchange simulation method, when the goal is single-temperature
canonical sampling. The concerns suggest other simulation strategies, such
as Hamiltonian exchange [19] and resolution exchange [20, 21], may merit
consideration — as well as scrutiny. We emphasize that our goal has been to
raise questions more than to answer them. Even if our worries turn out to
be exaggerated, a candid discussion of the issues should be beneﬁcial to the
molecular simulation community.

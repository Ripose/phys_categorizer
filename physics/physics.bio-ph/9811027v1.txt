Abstract

In the limit of small concentrations and weak applied electric ﬁelds,
the dielectric permittivity of suspensions of arbitrarily shaped, shelled and
charged particles is calculated. It is proved that the dielectric behavior
at low frequencies is dominated by the eﬀects of the diﬀusion of the free
charges on the shell surfaces. Our theoretical formula is valid in the
low range of frequencies (α dispersion) as well as in the high range of
frequencies (β dispersion). Will result that one can measure the membrane
electrical potential by a simple investigation of the living cell suspension
dielectric properties.

1 Introduction

The development of quantitative methods of characterizing the living matter
represents the subject of many researches of our days. The study of the electric
(dielectric) properties of biological systems belongs to this kind of programs.
A simple measurement of the dielectric permittivity of a living cells suspension
provides us with an important set of data which can be used to describe the
living matter [4, 17]. There are many factors which may inﬂuence the dielectric
behavior of the biological materials: structure, molecular dipoles orientation,
self interactions, surface conductance, diﬀusion, membrane transport processes
etc. All these factors inﬂuence one each other and it is hard (if not impossible)
to separate the eﬀect of a single one. However, some eﬀects are dominant
in certain ranges of frequencies and certain conditions. For example, in the
β-dispersion range (4 MHz-8 MHz), the dielectric behavior of the living cell
suspensions is mainly inﬂuenced by the dielectric structure. At low frequencies,
it is dominated by the diﬀusion eﬀects of the free charges accumulated around
the cell membrane [5]. Also, the orientation of molecular dipoles and membrane
transport processes become relevant when strong electric ﬁelds are applied. For
a survey of the ﬁeld and an extended bibliography one can consult [9].

The electric activity, in particular, the existence of the membrane potential
is one of the simplest factor which allows us to discern between a living and a
nonliving cell. We will show in this paper its inﬂuence on the dielectric proper-
ties of biological materials. Our model do not include rotational eﬀects or self
interactions, so one expects that our results to be valid only for diluted suspen-
sions and weak electric ﬁelds. We like to think that our work is complementary
to the works done in electrophoresis, where the applied electric ﬁelds are very
strong and the object of investigations is the induced membrane potential [11].
In this paper, the applied electric ﬁelds are weak and the object of investigation
is the inﬂuence of the membrane potential.

We calculate the dielectric permittivity of suspensions of shelled, arbitrar-
ily shaped particles with a superﬁcial distribution of free charges on the two
faces of the shell, in the limit of small concentrations and weak applied electric
ﬁelds. The method used here is similar with that of [3], the basic tools being
the functional calculus and the spectral decomposition of the operators. For the
real situation, the distributions of free charges are rather spatial than superﬁ-
cial. For usual values of the (3-D) diﬀusion constants, they have the support in
the immediate vicinity of the membrane (the distributions are practically zero
for the distances larger than 10−9 m) and this allows us to treat them as su-
perﬁcial distributions. Our numerical application will reveal the dependence of
the dielectric permittivity on the membrane electrical potential, mobility of the
free distribution of charges and particle geometry. All these factors are equally
important in the low range of frequency. It turns out that the consideration
of non-spherical geometries (especially non-convex geometries) may play an im-
portant role in some situations. For example, if one wants to investigate the
living cell cycles by dielectric measurements on synchronized cell suspensions,
then deﬁnitely, near the subdivision point, the shape eﬀects are considerable [7].
We don’t know yet how to relate our results with the electrorotation theory
[10] or how to combine them. We consider that is premature to compare our
theoretical results with the experimental results obtained by electrorotation,
which, at this time, seems to be the only accurate experimental data in the low
range of frequencies. This is mainly because of diﬀerent regimes of the applied
electric ﬁeld and concentrations.

2 The general analysis

From now, the perturbation of the external electric ﬁeld (which will be called
the excitation), due to the presence of a particle, will be called the response of
that particle to the excitation. It is known that the Lorentz method of dielectric
permittivity calculus works only if the response of the suspension constituents
is linear in respect to the excitation. When diﬀusion eﬀects are considered, this
fact is no longer true. This is the reason we start our analysis with the response
of a single particle to an external excitation.

Let us consider a particle with two dielectric phases (shelled particle), placed
in a spacial homogeneous and temporal oscillating electric ﬁeld. In addition, we

2

consider that we have a superﬁcial charge distribution on the shell faces. Laplace
equation, satisﬁed by the electrical potential, has to be completed with the
boundary conditions on the separation surfaces of the dielectric phases. These
conditions will be deducted from charge conservation equation. If one considers
a surface Σ which separates two dielectric mediums, D±, with a free charge ρ
distributed on it, then the electrical current density is formed by a volume one,

→
j± = σ± ·

→
E and a singular density,

→
given by
j sg, having the support on the
interface Σ. Denoting with n the net charge concentration (note that a part of
charges are due to diﬀerent conductivities σ+, σ−), the continuity equation for
a domain D, centered on the surface, is

This means that for ω 6= ω0 and ω 6= 0, we obtain trivial boundary conditions.
So the system has a trivial solution. For ω = 0, the above equation cannot be
written. It is being replaced with the condition

ρ(0)dS = ±Q,

ZΣ1,2

where ±Q represent the total free charge distributed on the two interfaces.
This leads to nontrivial boundary conditions and consequently to a nontrivial
solution. In consequence, the solution of the system has the following general
form:

Φ(x, t) = Φ0(x) + Φ(x) · exp(jω0t)
ρ(x, t) = ρ0(x) + ρ(x) · exp(jω0t)

The components Φ0 and ρ0 represent the solution of the system for zero external
excitation and will represent the equilibrium of the system. The equilibrium will

where the index Σ means that the operators are calculated on the surface. The
system is not linear, because the conductivities of the superﬁcial charges, γi,
depend on ρ. We will consider in the following that we are in the limit of weak
external electric ﬁelds so we can consider that the conductivities of the free
charges are given by the equilibrium conﬁguration. Thus the system becomes
linear. Now, the total electric ﬁeld will be the sum of the electrical ﬁelds of

the equilibrium conﬁguration and of the perturbation,

3 The equilibrium

In the following the primitivities and the conductivities will be denoted by: ε0,
σ0 for the exterior, ε1, σ1 for the membrane, ε2, σ2 for the interior. The sys-
tem which establish the equilibrium conﬁguration is obtained from the general
system by cancelling the temporal derivatives:

If we consider the conductivity of the membrane, σ1, equal with zero, we obtain
trivial Neumann condition for the electric potential, inside and outside of the
particle. This imposes constant electrical potential in the two regions. The
distribution of charges on the two interfaces, τ 1,2, can be calculated by applying
the Gauss law:

are

Et − D∇ρ0i ] = 0 =⇒ D∆ρ0i = 0 ⇐⇒ ρ0i = const.,

(20)

→
where
Et is the tangent electric ﬁeld to Σ1,2. The link between ρ0 and Q results
by the reason that the inside region is not an electric charges reservoir, which
means that the total charge on the interfaces is given only by the free charges.
Thus

±Q =

ρ01,2 dS = ρ01,2 · S1,2 ; Q = C · ∆V0

(21)

ZΣ1,2

where ∆V0 is the electric potential diﬀerence between the two surfaces (mem-
brane potential) and C is the capacity of a condenser having the geometry of
the shell and dielectric permittivity equal with ε1. The values of the ρ0i ﬁx the
electric conductivity on the two interfaces

where ui, i = 1, 2 are the charge mobilities on the two interfaces.

It was seen that, in the calculus of the dielectric permittivity, only the per-
turbation part of the electric ﬁeld is important. So the only inﬂuence of the
membrane electric potential on the dispersions curves of the dielectric permit-
tivity comes from the above formula.

4 The eﬀective calculus of the polarization

The charges on the second interface lie behind the shell, so the external electric
ﬁeld will have a smaller inﬂuence on them than on the charges of the ﬁrst
In the same time, it is an experimental fact that the mobility of
interface.
the inside charges is much smaller than that of external charges. Both reasons
justify the idea of considering the free charges of the inside interface to be
ﬁxed (i.e. zero mobility). With this simpliﬁcation, the value of ρ2 is ﬁxed at
the equilibrium value. Now we have inhomogeneous particles with free electric
charges only on their surface.

4.1 The equivalence between an inhomogeneous particle

and a homogeneous one

Let us consider now the shelled particle placed in the same electric ﬁeld. We
consider here that the external surface of the shell is obtained by expanding
the internal surfaces by a factor δ > 1. The equivalence problem between this
inhomogeneous dielectric particle and a homogeneous one can be formulated in

the following terms: there exists a distribution of charges only on the external
surface of the shell, µe, which provides the true electric ﬁeld outside of par-
ticle. In the dipole approximation, this distribution is given by the following
expression:

the shelled particle is equivalent to a homogeneous particle which has the same

which says that the normal component of the electric ﬁeld created by the charge
distribution µ2 on the surfaces Σ1 has the same angular dependence as on the
surfaces Σ2 but the strength of the ﬁeld is diminished by a factor δ−3, and that
the normal component of the electric ﬁeld created by the distribution µ1 on the

(

Using again the spectral decomposition of the operator ˆE and the link (31) be-
tween µe and µ1, µ2, the desired form of the distribution µe follows immediately.
One can see that the method can be extended to the multi-shelled particles. In
this way, the results of [1] can be extended to arbitrary geometries.

ρ is present. For a homogeneous dielectric particle with dielectric permittivity

4.2 The formula for polarization

We can use the idea of equivalence to ﬁnd a compact formula for polarization.
For this, we have to transform the volume integral which appears in the deﬁni-
tion of α,

into an integral on the external side of the particle surface where we can use the

equivalence. In the above formula, ε depends on the point, and
E is the exact
ﬁeld inside of the particle, prodeced by the excitation ~N , of norm one. We will
calculate the term as follow:

As we already discussed, the last term is practically zero at high frequencies
and becomes dominant at low frequencies.

5 Numerical results

First, we will present our method of solving the complicated equation (41) of
µα. Here, the principal problem is the calculation of the spectral projectors of
ˆE and ∆Σ operators. Let us suppose that our surface is given in the spherical
coordinates by r = r (θ, ϕ). To solve the problem for the ˆE operator, we will
choose the following orthonormal basis in L2 (Σ):

{Ylm} m∈Z
l≥|m|

; Ylm (θ, ϕ) =

Ylm (θ, ϕ)
σ (θ, ϕ)

,

(53)

where {Ylm}l,m represents the spherical harmonics and dS = σ (θ, ϕ) sin (θ) dθdϕ.
The ﬁrst step is the calculation of the matrix elements of the operator ˆE. Then,
taking acceptable truncated matrices, we will calculate the approximative spec-
trum. The approximative projectors will be given by ˆPn = Pn
, where Pn

p

ˆE
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

12

are the polynomials which satisfy Pn (χm) = δnm for each eigenvalue χm. For
the operator ∆Σ, we have followed the way presented in [14].

We have chosen the surfaces of ﬁgure 1 for our numerical application. As
we already emphasized, γ is proportional with the electrical potential of the
membrane and the mobility of the free charges. Because the diﬀusion constant
is also proportional with the superﬁcial charge mobility, the quantity γ/D is
proportional only to the membrane electrical potential. We will choose diﬀerent
values for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D, and for the ratio γ/D, which will give
us the dependance of the dispersion curves on the mobility of free charges and
membrane electrical potential. Because the α eﬀect on the conductivity is much
smaller than on the dielectric constant, we are enforced to consider two diﬀerent
values of the parameters: one for which one can see in detail the behavior
of dielectric constant and one for which one can see in detail the behavior of
conductivity. The results are presented in ﬁgures 2-13. The following parameters
were kept constant in our numerical analysis to the following values (the units
are in S.I): ε0 = 78εvac, ε1 = 10εvac, ε2 = 50εvac, σ0 = 0.2, σ1 = 0, σ2 = 0.3,
p = 0.06, δ = 1.004.

6 Conclusions

We want to point out ﬁrst the relation of our results with the existent results.
In the β-dispersion range of frequencies, the importance of ˆE operator, in this
type of analysis, was pointed out in [18]. Basically, this method reduces the
original equations of the electric ﬁeld to surface equations. Mathematically, this
means that it transforms a problem involving unbounded operators (Laplace
operator corresponding to certain boundary conditions) to a problem involving
compact operators (the operator ˆE). Here and in [6] it is given a semi-empirical
justiﬁcation of the formulas (28) but, unfortunately, the formula of polarization
is not exact. Our paper states in very precise terms what equivalation means,
proves rigorously the formulas (28) and that of polarization. Another result
directly related with our approach would be [2], where the method of equivala-
tion is discussed. Note that this result (and the method itself) depends on very
particular surfaces considered there. In the α-dispersion range of frequencies,
there are some results for the case of spherical geometry [5] (and what follows
after) but, as is stated in the beginnig of this paper, the results are valid only
in a quasi-statical regime. One can see that, in the limit of zero diﬀusion con-
stants, its passing equations does not reduce to the usual equation, but rather
to two separate equations: one for conduction current and one for displacement
current.
In fact, this was our reason for we have treated very carefully the
introductory sections.

In conclusion, this approach gives a unitary treatment of α and β-dispersion
in the general context of arbitrary geometries. In the β-dispersion range of fre-
quency, our paper corrects and puts some existent results in rigorous settings.
In the α range, it proposes a completely new approach which allows us to avoid
problems like that mentioned before. Also, it proves the general formula of po-

13

larization which includes the eﬀects of the free charges. Our model reproduces,
qualitatively, the dielectric behavior of living cell suspensions in both α and β
frequencies ranges and is ﬂexible enough to reproduce any given curve which
has this shape. The numerical application shows a very strong dependency of
the dielectric dispersion curves on the membrane electrical potential. This fact
anticipates the possibility of the experimental measurement of the membrane
electrical potential by a simple measurement of the dielectric permittivity. Be-
sides this important cell parameter, one can measure the mobility of the free
charges and, as in [13], the volume concentration of the suspension. We em-
phasize that this method is a non-destructive and can be a very fast one (a
discussion about this can be found in [8]).

The ﬂuctuation properties of the human electroencephalo-
gram (EEG) time series are studied using detrended ﬂuctu-
ation analysis. For all 128 channels in each of 18 subjects
studied, it is found that the standard deviation of the ﬂuctu-
ations exhibits scaling behaviors in two regions. Topographi-
cal plots of the scaling exponents reveal the spatial structure
of the nonlinear electrical activities recorded on the scalp.
Moment analyses are performed to extract the gross features
of all the scaling exponents. The correlation between the two
scaling exponents in each channel is also examined. It is found
that two indices can characterize the overall properties of the
ﬂuctuation behaviors of the brain dynamics for every subject
and that they vary widely across the subjects.

I. INTRODUCTION

The scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a
wealth of information about human brain dynamics. The
complex nature of brain dynamics results in a high degree
of ﬂuctuations in both the spatial and temporal aspects
of the EEG signals. To extract the salient properties
from the data is the primary objective of any method of
analysis. We present in this paper a novel method that
explores the scaling behavior of the ﬂuctuations and uses
moment analysis to reduce the complexity of the results
obtained.

The most common methods of EEG time series analy-
ses are event-related time ensemble averaging and Fourier
decomposition, both of which are based implicitly on
assumptions of linearity [1,2]. Since the physiological
mechanisms underlying the scalp EEG are generally non-
linear, they can generate ﬂuctuations that are not best
described by linear decomposition. Moreover, the rest-
ing EEG always displays a broad-banded power spec-
trum, so in Fourier analysis one must arbitrarily de-
ﬁne frequency bands (δ, θ, α, · · ·) which may not actu-
ally delineate diﬀerent dynamical mechanisms. Wavelet
analyses have also been applied to examine EEG time
series [3], but at a sacriﬁce of the ability to describe
long-range temporal correlations. Chaos analyses have
been applied to quantify the nonlinear behavior of the

1

brain [4–6], but typically require a long period of time
to compute attractor properties for a single time series.
Moreover, chaos-based approaches assume the existence
of low-dimensional attractors, and this is probably not
generally a valid assumption for the brain. In this paper,
we discuss a method that analyzes the ﬂuctuations in
EEG over a short period of time (around 10s), and makes
use of the information conveyed by all 128 channels on
the scalp. We show the existence of scaling behaviors of
certain measures of ﬂuctuations in all channels and in all
subjects. We propose two global measures of the spatio-
temporal signals that characterize the distinctive nature
of EEG for each subject.

The study of scaling behavior emphasizes the relation-
ship across time scales. We aim to ﬁnd what is universal
among all channels as well as what varies among them.
The former is obviously important by virtue of its uni-
versality for a given subject; how that universal quantity
varies from subject to subject is clearly interesting. What
varies from channel to channel is perhaps even more in-
teresting, since it has implications for describing focal
features which could have functional or clinical relevance.
Our procedure is to focus initially on one channel at a
time. Thus it is a study of the local temporal behavior
and the determination of a few parameters (scaling expo-
nents) that eﬀectively summarize the ﬂuctuation proper-
ties of the time series. The second phase of our procedure
is to describe the global behavior of all channels and to
arrive at two numbers that summarize the variability of
these temporal measures across the entire scalp surface.
This dramatic data reduction necessarily trades detail for
succinctness, but such reduction is exactly what is needed
to allow easy discrimination between brain states.

The emphasis in this paper is on the method of analy-
sis. It is not our aim here to perform clinical and cogni-
tive analyses. Due to the fact that the EEG data avail-
able to us are short in time duration and few in the
number of subjects studied, it is not feasible for us to
make reliable inference on the physiological implications
of our ﬁndings. Nevertheless, the data are suﬃcient for
the extraction of interesting behaviors that are channel
dependent as well as subject dependent.

II. DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS

The speciﬁc method we use in the ﬁrst phase is de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA). This analysis is not
new. It was proposed for the investigation of correlation
properties in non-stationary time series and applied to
the studies of heartbeat [7] and DNA nucleotides [8]. It
has also been applied to EEG [9], but with somewhat
diﬀerent emphases than those presented here. Since the
analysis considers only the ﬂuctuations from the local lin-
ear trends, it is insensitive to spurious correlations intro-
duced by non-stationary external trends. By examining
the scaling behavior one can learn about the nature of
short-range and long-range correlations.

Let an EEG time series be denoted by y(t), where t
is discrete time ranging from 1 to T . Divide the entire
range of t to be investigated into B equal bins, discard-
ing any remainder, so that each bin has k = ﬂoor(T /B)
time points. Within each bin, labeled b (b = 1, · · · , B),
perform a least-square ﬁt of y(t) by a straight line, yb(t),
i.e., yb(t) = Linear-ﬁt[y(t)] for (b − 1)k < t ≤ bk. That is
the semi-local trend for the bth bin. Deﬁne F 2
b (k) to be
the variance of the ﬂuctuation y(t) from yb(t) in the bth
bin, i.e.,

bk

F 2

b (k) =

1
k

Xt=(b−1)k+1

[y(t) − yb(t)]2

(1)

It is a measure of the semi-locally detrended ﬂuctuation
in bin b. The average of F 2

b (k) over all bins is

F 2(k) =

F 2

b (k).

B

1
B

b=1
X
F (k) is then the RMS ﬂuctuation from the semi-local
trends in B bins each having k time points.

The study of the dependence of F (k) on the bin size k
is the essence of DFA [7,8]. If it is a power-law behavior

(2)

(3)

F (k) ∝ kα,

then the scaling exponent α is an indicator of the corre-
lations of the ﬂuctuations in EEG, which depends on the
relationship of these ﬂuctuations across time scales. Since
DFA considers only the ﬂuctuations from the semi-local
linear trends, it is insensitive to spurious correlations in-
troduced by non-stationary external trends. This is a
practical advantage since EEG acquisition systems often
suﬀer from slow drifts associated with gradual changes in
the quality of electrode contact to the skin. The analysis
also liberates our result from the dependence on the over-
all magnitude of the voltage y(t) recorded by each probe,
which is an advantage since overall signal amplitude can
vary across subjects, presumably due to diﬀerences in
skull conductivity and other factors.

Resting EEG data were collected for 18 subjects us-
ing a 128-channel commercial EEG system, with scalp-
electrode impedences ranging from 10 to 40 kΩ. The

data were hardware ﬁltered between 0.1 and 100 Hz, then
digitized at 250 points/sec. After acquisition, T ≈ 10s
lengths of simultaneous time series in all channels are
chosen, free of artifacts such as eye blink and head move-
ments. At each time point, the average across all elec-
trodes was subtracted, to remove approximately the ef-
fect of the reference electrode [2]. We investigate the
range of k from 3 to 500 in approximately equal steps of
ln k.

In Fig. 1 we show three typical time series y(t) in three
widely separated channels for subject A, labeled 1-3, for
brevity. While it is clear that both channels 2 and 3
have substantial 10 Hz oscillations after 0.2s, it is much
less apparent that there exist any scaling behaviors in
all three channels. The corresponding values of F (k) are
shown in the log-log plot in Fig. 2. Evidently, the strik-
ing feature is that there are two scaling regions with a
discernible bend when the two slopes in the two regions
are distinctly diﬀerent. With rare exceptions this feature
is found in all channels for all subjects. Admittedly, the
extents of the scaling regions are not wide, so the behav-
ior does not meet the qualiﬁcation for scaling in large
critical systems or in fractal geometrical objects. How-
ever, since the behavior is so universal across channels
and subjects, and since the temporal scales involved are
physiologically relevant, the scaling behavior is a feature
of EEG that conveys an important property of the brain
activity and should not be overlooked.

III. SCALING AND NONSCALING PROPERTIES

The fact that there exist two scaling regions suggests
that the lack of scaling in the region between the two im-
plies the existence of some signiﬁcant time scale. From
Fig. 1 one indeed sees roughly periodic oscillations in Ch.
2 and 3. One may therefore be tempted to think that if,
instead of considering the ﬂuctuations from the linear
semi-local trends ¯yb(t), one studies the ﬂuctuations from
periodic oscillations, then the bend would disappear and
the two scaling regions might be joined to become one.
However, even if that were true, such a procedure should
not be used for two reasons. First, not all channels ex-
hibit obvious oscillatory behaviors with deﬁnite frequen-
cies. Channel 1 in Fig. 1 is one such example. Whatever
detrending one chooses should be universally applied to
all channels in order to avoid introducing discrepencies
across the channels due to external intervention. Sec-
ond, to determine the frequency of the oscillatory trend
requires a Fourier analysis, which is precisely what our
approach attempts to circumvent. To decide on a sinu-
soidal wave of a particular frequency as reference for de-
trending involves arbitrariness and is unlikely to lead to
any simpliﬁcation in the global picture. The simplest and
unbiased approach is to use the semi-local linear trends,
as we have done.

To quantify the scaling behavior, we perform a linear

2

ﬁt in Region I for 1 < lnk < 2.5 and denote the slope by
α1, and similarly in Region II for 3.5 < lnk < 5.75 with
slope denoted by α2. Visual inspection for each of the 18
subjects veriﬁes that ﬁtting this way does a remarkably
good job of characterizing the slopes in the two regions.
Knowing the two straight lines in each channel allows us
to determine the location of their intercept, ln κ, which
gives a good approximation for the position of the bend
in lnk. We ﬁnd that, whereas α1 and α2 can ﬂuctuate
widely from channel to channel, κ is limited to a nar-
row range in most subjects. The average value of lnκ for
each subject ranges from 2.6 to 3.6, with a grand aver-
age across subjects to be approximately 3.1. It should,
however, be noted that when α1 and α2 are nearly the
same, as is the case for Ch. 1 in Fig. 2, the determination
of κ by the intersection of the two straight lines is not
reliable. Nevertheless, it is visually clear that the bend
occurs in the vicinity of lnκ = 3.1.

Since scaling behavior means that the system exam-
ined has no intrinsic scale, scale noninvariance at κ im-
plies that κ is related to a dominant frequency of oscilla-
tion in the time series. It is at this point that a contact
can be made with the usual Fourier analysis. Although
our analysis focuses on scale invariant quantities, i.e., the
dimensionless scaling exponents, it is worth digressing
momentarily to establish this contact. To do this, we
loosely associate the time scale κ with the period of a
sine wave with frequency f . If the data acquisition rate
is denoted by r, then the frequency f corresponding to κ
is

f = r/κ.

(4)

For our data acquisition we have r = 250 points/sec. For
the across-subject average of lnκ = 3.1, we get from Eq.
(4) f = 11.3 Hz. That is in the middle of the traditional
α (8-13 Hz) EEG frequency band. Thus the dominant
periodic oscillation apparent in Fig. 1 does reveal itself
in the study of the scaling behavior. If one’s interest is
in the frequency content of the EEG time series, then
Fourier analysis is more direct. However, if the interest
is in the ﬂuctuation properties and their relationships
across time scales, then DFA is more eﬀective. Hereafter,
frequency will play no essential role in the remainder of
this paper.

For each subject we have 128 pairs of values of (α1, α2),
which summarize the temporal ﬂuctuations in terms of
scaling exponents. In Fig. 3, we exhibit by scatter plot
the values of α1 and α2 of all channels for subject A. The
three points marked with circles correspond to the chan-
nels shown in Fig. 2. The error bars in Fig. 3 indicate the
goodness of ﬁt of the two regions by straight lines. Since
the variability of the scaling exponents across channels
is large compared to the error in ﬁt, the diﬀerent val-
ues convey numerically meaningful information. For this
subject, Region I exhibits better scaling behavior than
Region II, although the error bars on α2 are not so large
as to call into question the power-law description in Re-
gion II.

Overall, for subject A, the scaling exponents are in
the ranges: 0.19 < α1 < 1.44 and 0.018 < α2 < 0.489.
Whereas α1 is widely distributed, α2 is sharply peaked
at 0.1 and has a long tail. The value of α = 0.5 corre-
sponds to random walk with no correlation among the
various time points. For α 6= 0.5 there are correlations:
Region I corresponds to short-range correlation, Region
II long-range, with κ giving a quantitative demarkation
between the two. In most channels we ﬁnd α1 > α2, al-
though there are a few where α1 ≈ α2. The scatter plots
of all other subjects are similar in general features to the
one shown in Fig. 3, but vary in detail from subject to
subject.
It is impractical to show them all in this pa-
per. Evidently, it is desirable to ﬁnd a way to quantify
succinctly these 128 pairs of numbers so that one can
eﬀectively compare the results across subjects.

A scatter plot such as Fig. 3 reveals very well how the
αi exponents of all the channels are related to one an-
other. However, it shows nothing about the locations of
the channels on the scalp. To show that, we use the to-
pographical plots of α1 and α2 separately, as in Fig. 4,
to exhibit the spatial structure of the signals extracted.
The dissociation of α1 from α2 is a price paid to gain the
spatial perspective on the scalp. Topographic plots such
as this may be useful for specifying the location of focal
features, e.g., associated with particular brain functions
and/or pathologies. Thus topographical and scatter plots
present diﬀerent aspects of the ﬂuctuation properties of
the brain electrical activity of any given subject. Both
are ineﬃcient for comparison across subjects. What we
need is a global measure that describes the general, over-
all feature of all αi pairs in the form of a single parameter.

IV. MOMENTS OF THE SCALING EXPONENTS

We propose to consider the moments of the scaling
In general, if we have N numbers, zj, j =

exponents.
1, · · · , N, we can calculate the moments

Gq =

1
N

N

j=1
X

zq
j ,

(5)

where q is a positive integer [10]. The information con-
tained in the ﬁrst N moments (i.e., q = 1, · · · , N ) is
enough to reproduce all the zj by inversion. However,
we may be interested in only a few of the Gq with lower
order q, each of which contains some information of all
the zj. In our present problem we have N = 128, and we
shall consider the ﬁrst ten orders, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10. That is a
signiﬁcant reduction of numbers, a process worth inves-
tigating.

Before calculating the moments of αi, let us see how
those values are distributed. Let x be either α1 or α2.
Since no value of αi has been found to exceed 1.5 in
the subjects we have examined, we consider the interval
0 ≤ x ≤ 1.5. Divide that interval into M equal cells,

3

which for deﬁniteness we take to be M = 150 here. Let
the cells be labeled by m = 1, · · · , M , each having the
size δx = 1.5/M . Denote the number of channels whose
x values are in the mth cell by nm. Deﬁne

Pm = nm / N.

(6)

It is the fraction of channels whose x values are in the
range (m − 1) δx ≤ x < m δx. By deﬁnition, we have
M
m=1 Pm = 1. In Fig. 5 we show as an illustration the
two graphs of Pm for subject A. The two graphs corre-
P
spond to α1 and α2, and are, in essence, the projections
of the scatter plot in Fig. 3 onto the α1 and α2 axes.
From Fig. 5 we see that α1 is widely distributed, while
α2 is not. G1 gives the average, and G2 is related to the
width.

Since the ﬂuctuation of m in Pm should be measured
relative to its mean, let us consider the normalized mo-
ments [11]

where i = 1 or 2. Since these moments are averages of
(m/m)q, where m is the average-m, they are not very
sensitive to m itself. They contain the essence of the
ﬂuctuation properties of α1,2 in all channels. In terms
of the scaling exponents explicitly, let us use αi(j) to
denote the value of αi for channel j so that Eq.(7) may
be rewritten as

In principle, it is possible to examine also the moments
for q < 0, which would reveal the properties of Pm at
low values of m. However, the accuracy of our data is
not too reliable for low-k analysis, since the 60 Hz noise
due to ambient electric and magnetic ﬁelds has not been
cleanly ﬁltered out. In this paper, therefore, we restrict
our study to only the positive q values. For high q, the
large m/m parts of P (1,2)

dominate M (1,2)
m
In Fig. 6 the q-dependences of ln M (1,2)

.
are shown for
the distributions exhibited in Fig. 5 for 2 ≤ q ≤ 10. They
are approximately linear except for the low values of q.
The same type of dependencies on q are found for all
subjects. In Fig. 6 we show two straight lines that can ﬁt
very well the nearly linear behaviors of ln M (i)
vs q for
q
q ≥ 5. Thus for large q we have

q

q

M (i)

q ∝ exp (µi q),

q ≥ 5.

(9)

The linear extrapolations of the lines to lower values of
q show the degree of deviation of the the calculated val-
ues of ln M (1,2)
and lnM (2)

from linearity. Since lnM (1)

q

behave so similarly in their departures from the linear
dependencies on q, we plot lnM (2)
in order to
exhibit their direct relationship without explicit depen-
dence on q. We ﬁnd that they are linearly related over a
wider range of values. This linearity is found to be true
for all subjects. The plots for three of them are illus-
trated in Fig. 7, where the straight lines are the linear
ﬁts. Thus the implication is that there exists a universal
power-law behavior

valid for all subjects examined. From Eqs.(9) and (10)
we obtain

M (2)

q ∝

M (1)
q

(cid:16)

η

(cid:17)

η = µ2/µ1,

(10)

(11)

but now η is meaningful for all q (except for the lowest
points) and in that sense independent of q. Thus we
have discovered a global measure η that characterizes all
αi values of a subject, and varies from subject to subject.
We postpone the display of all the η values for all subjects
until later.

To understand the exponential behavior in Eq.(9), we
note that Gq is dominated by large zj when q is large, as
is self-evident in Eq.(5). For asymptotically large q, we
have Gq ∝ exp (q ln zmax), where zmax = max {zj}. For
intermediate q, all large values of zj can make important
contributions, and the exponential dependence on q can
still prevail. The denominator in Eq.(7) is Gq
1 = ¯zq =
exp ( q ln¯z ), where ¯z is the average of zj, so it is also
exponential for any q. It is therefore clear that Eq.(9)
follows, and that µi depends on all zj with more weight
on the large zj values. The power-law behavior of Eq.(10)
implies that the exponent η is independent of q and that
all αi values are relevant contributors to the universal
behavior. This is an important point worth emphasizing:
the independence of η on q implies that the whole spectra
of α1 and α2 are summarized by the one index η. The
fact that η varies from subject to subject is a consequence
of the variability of all 128 pairs of (α1, α2) across the
subjects, and oﬀers the possibility that η can be used as
a discriminating representation of the brain state.

V. CORRELATIONS OF THE SCALING
EXPONENTS

The analysis in the preceding section treats the mo-
ments of α1 and α2 separately. Only in the last step are
the global properties embodied in M (1)
related
through the exponent η in Eq.(10). In that approach the
pairing of α1 with α2 in each channel is not taken into
account. However, we know that there are channels, such
as Ch. 1 in Figs. 1 and 2, where the absence of a dom-
inant mode of oscillation results in α1 ≈ α2. Thus the

ﬂuctuations from linear trends deﬁned over varying time
scale, we have found two scaling regions in which the
RMS ﬂuctuations can be characterized by two dimen-
sionless scaling exponents, α1 and α2, for each channel.
We then performed moment analyses to reduce the large
number of pairs of (α1, α2) to simple and manageable
forms. The two types of independent moments, M (i)
q
and Nq, yield two indices, η and ν, which provide con-
cise signatures of the nonlinear behavior of all channels
of the EEG signals.

Our emphasis in this paper has been on the method of
analysis rather than on the physiological interpretation
of the results. For the latter task it is necessary to have
not only more data, but also detailed information on the
physical conditions of the subjects so as to have a refer-
ence frame to calibrate the indices obtained. However,
working with 18 subjects is suﬃcient to demonstrate the
eﬀectiveness of the method, to show the universality of
the scaling behaviors, to reveal the range of variability of
the indices derived, and to oﬀer the possibility of a new
way of understanding human brain activity.

We are grateful to Prof. Don Tucker and Dr. Phan
Luu for supplying the EEG data for our analysis. We
have also beneﬁted from the computational assistance

correlation between the two scaling exponents is an im-
portant feature that should be explored and quantiﬁed.
To that end we deﬁne

β = α2/α1

(12)

for each channel. In most cases we have β < 1, but β > 1
is possible and, by its rarity, noteworthy.

From a scatter plot, such as Fig. 3, it is possible to
visualize the β distribution, since β is just the slope of
a line from the origin to each point. We show in Fig. 8
the β distributions for the same three subjects as those
in Fig. 7. Subject B is chosen for display because it has
the largest η, while subject C is chosen because it has
several β values that exceed 1.

To summarize the 128 values of βj for each subject, we
apply to them the moment analysis that is developed in
Sec. IV. Let us therefore deﬁne

with a distinct ν for each subject. Clearly, the ones with
wide β distributions relative to their means have higher
values of ν.

We now have found two indices, η and ν, for each sub-
ject. They describe diﬀerent aspects of the scaling expo-
nents. To display those values, it is illuminating to show
the scatter plot of (η, ν), as in Fig. 10, which has 18 points
for the 18 subjects studied. The subjects A, B and C are
denoted by distinct symbols, same as in Fig. 9. We see
that the points in Fig. 10 appear to form a band, roughly
correlated in η and ν. Only subject C has a value of ν
that lies above the band, and it is C who has several β val-
ues above 1. Whether that is an anomaly carrying some
physiological signiﬁcance is an issue outside the scope of
this paper, since we assume no knowledge of the physical
conditions of the subjects. We are similarly ignorant at
this point about the meaning of the spread of the (η, ν)
values. However, it is encouraging that the scatter plot
in (η, ν) is widely distributed for the 18 subjects, since it
oﬀers the possibility of being a discriminating tool, quite
diﬀerent from the alternative scenario, if the parameters
determined in an analysis had turned out to be nearly
the same for all subjects.

VI. CONCLUSION

Recognizing that the brain is a highly nonlinear sys-
tem, we have explored a possible way of analyzing the

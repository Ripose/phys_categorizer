Abstract

In this work, we revisit the basic reproduction rate R0 deﬁnition for analysis of epidemic-non-

epidemic phases describing the dynamics of the discrete stochastic version of the epidemic SIR

model based on the Master Equation formalism. One shows that it is a very precise and eﬃcient

way to determine the epidemic threshold; using its most primitive concept, we can ﬁnd exact

results.

Introduction - The basic reproduction rate, R0, is the most fundamental parameter used

by epidemiologists [1].

It has raised interest of physiscists because of analogies between

epidemic and percolation systems [2, 3, 4, 5], and its generality, that permits, for example,

analyze spreading of viruses in a structured scale-free network [6]. The deﬁnition of R0 is

“the average number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual in a completely

susceptible population” [7]. This simple idea had a profound eﬀect on epidemic theory. It

may be a global insight that cuts through the details of the transmission process, because

it originated from consideration of deterministic models of homogeneous population with

random mixing [8]. However, putting more details in the model one can extend its deﬁnition

to heterogeneous mixing. In this way, naturally the eﬀorts were in analytical calculations of

R0 for continuous deterministic or stochastic models [2, 9, 10]. The stochastic framework,

although more realistic in principle, it is more complex to analyze because of detail required

[11, 12, 13]. Commonly, simulations helped to conﬁrm theoretical assumptions. Improved

machine technology has spread the use of computationally intensive methods to solve a

great diversity of epidemics, and so simulation technics, as Dynamical Monte Carlo (DMC)

[14, 15, 16, 17], are becoming more popular in this subject. Taken on the advantage of

the DMC method, we can calculate R0 straightforward. Thus, we adopted this approach

to characterize the separation between the epidemic and non-epidemic phases, because its

eﬃciency and simplicity that enables a facile ﬁnding of exact results.

Throughout this Letter, we shall consider the classical SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Re-

moved) epidemic model, originally based on the chemical “mass action” principle (see [18]

and references therein), to illustrate the discrete stochastic approaches. Our model encloses

the deterministic one as a particular case. Based on the Master equation formalism we

generalize the SIR model and R0 for discrete stochastic systems. Also, we describe the

local epidemic model with an exact result to R0 using its primitive concept. Finally, we

show a phase diagram of the local − SIR model, with deterministic-like behavior, where no

homogeneous mixing is considered, and dynamical Monte Carlo simulation results.

Generalized SIR model and R0 - Stochastic process approaches could simulate non-

equilibrium systems, even the deterministic ones, introducing random variables to describe

them in a microscopic scale. The macroscopic behavior of some system is resulting from

averages of its microscopic properties. One can describes the evolution of the distribution

2

of probabilities, for markovian processes, with the Master Equation:

dPi(t)
dt

= X
j

wj→iPj − X
j

wi→jPi,

where Pi is the probability to ﬁnd the system at the state i at the time t, and wi→j is the

transition probability per unity of time. Considering Tij the probability of transition from i
to j, we may write wi→j = Tij
τ i

[19], where τ i is a characteristic time constant (lifetime) of

the state i.

We now start by choosing a convenient physical extensive microscopic quantity Ai, which

depends only of the system’s state i. Since the time must change for every successful event,

we will consider only counting events related quantities. To SIR epidemic systems the

number of infected individuals, for example, is an adequate quantity because it represents

the balance between the number of infection and removal events. The mean value for a given

quantity at the time t is

This equation represents a continuous physical macroscopic quantity A(t). We can diﬀer-

entiate both sides of the equation above, with respect to t. After that, using (1), and by

deﬁning ∆Aij = Ai − Aj, we get

Consider now the nearest-neighbor states j of a given state i; if we measure the “distance”

between the states, say by the quantity |∆Aij|, such that the non-null minimum value is

|∆Aij| = a, we may approach the equation (3) by:

A(t) = hAi = X

Pi(t)Ai.

where the symbol

(ij) denotes a nearest-neighbor pair of states, and δij = ∆Aij/|∆Aij|.

Now we consider another physical quantity A† that represents a source for the quantity A.

Thus, we can rewrite (4) as:

where rj =< wj→i >i are the averaged transition probabilities per unity of time over the

ensemble of the nearest-neighbor states i of j at some time t, i.e., the mesoscopic rates.

Here, the word ensemble means a set of conﬁgurations accessible at a ﬁnite (small) time

around a time t; in this sense we are using a time dependent ergodicity idea [14], and so

generally the systems are non ergodic in nonequilibrium states. The superscripts “ + ”

and “ − ” mean respectively the contributions to increasing and to decreasing the quantity

A(t) [20].

Based on (5), we formulated the GSIR model through the following set of stochastic

The mesoscopic rates are rj

with the total number of individuals N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) is satisﬁed. One may obtain

the reproduction rate, R0, directly from the equations (6 − 8) with the epidemic condition

dt ≥ 0; where the equality is the threshold and it is set to t0 = 0, the initial time. Thus,
we can do Pj rj

the ensemble average of initial states j0 that gives the same initial condition S0, I0 and R0,

we may deﬁne

R0 =

< rSI >0 S0
< rIR >0 I0

;

(10)

the average number of the secondary cases produced by I0 infected initially. Note that if

we do < rSI >0= bI0 and < rIR >0= a we recover the deterministic case [12]. One must

observe that if some initial conﬁguration is ﬁxed, one does not need the averages in (10),

but only obtain the rates, rSI and rIR; so, of course, generally, the R0 depends on the initial

conﬁguration choice. In many practical situations this is important because it will determine

4

an epidemic or not. We can easily adapt the result above to other models, as the SIS model

[6], for example, to analysis of the epidemic threshold.

Local epidemic model - Generically, the temporal and spatial evolution characterize any

epidemics, where in each part of the system the density of the elements can vary with the

time. One can analyze this process through a two-dimensional lattice, in which each site,

representing an individual of the population, receives own attributes as susceptibility and

interactivity referring each site with the others. We will analyze a model with local contact

only. The elements are all ﬁxed, i.e., no populational mobility is considered. The main

reason to study a such particular model is that we have more ﬂuctuations, and so it is a

good test to the eﬃciency of our approach.

The probability of individuals contracts the illness, in transmitting a disease by contact,

depends on the status (susceptible, infected or removed) in which they meet its neighbors;

its chance of getting sick will depend on the number of sick neighbors. Thus, considering an

element possesses n infective neighbors, and an infection chance, p0, due to each neighbor,

the probability of its change in a sick element (through n eﬀective contacts) will be [18]:

wSI = Λ[1 − (1 − p0)n].

(11)

Therefore, (1 − p0)n is the probability of no infection of a susceptible (individual) if it has n
infected neighbors, thus 1 − (1 − p0)n is the probability of infection of a susceptible if it has

n infected neighbors. The Λ parameter gives the wSI as inverse of time units. When n = 0,

that is, when no neighbor is contaminated, the probability of contamination due to contact is

zero, so wSI increases when the number of eﬀective contacts, n, increases. A global removal

rate determines the infectious period, and an infected individual turn immune (removed)

stochastically. So the infectious period for each individual ﬂuctuates over an average number

given by the inverse of the removal rate, like in the mean ﬁeld approach [21]. In this sense

our deﬁnition of R0 is more general than that gave in the reference [13]. Also has a diﬀerence

that it is considered instantaneously instead during the infectious period, so it follows close

the classical deﬁnition. However, we considered a range of initial values to the number of

infected individuals, and did an analysis with an initial random distribution of immunes.

Note that for the considered model in a square lattice, when I0 = 1, we have the trivial

exact result

(12)

R0 =

nmaxΛp0
wIR

,

where nmax is the maximum number of contacts. One can see that the exact result to a

more thorough model, including the homogeneous mixing (mean ﬁeld), is straightforward.

The reference [13] shows this result as an analytical approximation to R0.

Results and ﬁnal remarks - For practical purposes one distributes the individuals on a

square lattice of N = M × M sites. All the individuals at the lattice boundary have their

statuses ﬁxed at susceptible status. One considered only two lattice sizes, M = 10 and

200, because increasing M reaches smooth curves near to the M = 200 rapidly. We did
rj
IR = q = 1, constant independent of the conﬁguration, and rj
all individual probabilities that appear in any random conﬁguration j; with wSI modeled
with a purely local interaction with Λ = 1, so wSI = 1 − (1 − p0)n. The initial condition

SI = < wSI >j, averaged over

for the number of infectives, I0, to the system, for M = 10, was varying from 1 to 99, and,

for M = 200, from 1 up to 38000 randomly distributed on the lattice. One occupies the

remaining sites by S0 = N − I0 susceptibles, so R0 = 0 for both cases. We did the variable

n as an integer ranging from 0 to 8, since the ﬁrst and second nearest infected neighbors

are indistinguishably considered for each susceptible.

Considering that the sum of the “microscopic inﬂuences” creates a rate rSI, we calculated

by a sample average the initial mean rate < rSI >0. Of course in the practice of the

simulation we drew randomly only a few conﬁgurations to estimate the averages and we

used the equation (10) to elaborate the phase diagrams for the SIR model showed in the

ﬁgure 1. We got the values for < rSI >0 using 100 and 4 × 104 conﬁgurations for M = 200

and 10 respectively. Observe that the maximum R0 happens when the probability p0 reaches

its largest value in a great population of susceptible. We found for M = 10, the epidemic

threshold in the interval R0 = 1.03 − 1.05. For M = 200, the interval reduced to a very thin

line deﬁned at R0 = 1, as expected to inﬁnite systems. Note that the R0 contour lines for

M = 10 are noisy because of the small size of the lattice. For cases when R0 > 1, happen

epidemic bursts in average, and when R0 < 1 does not. We did, also, experiments with a

non-zero initial immune individuals number, R0, and its qualitative eﬀect on R0 is the same

as for R0 = 0, since we have a random initial distribution of immunes. Quantitatively, for

the initial infectives number ﬁxed, we need to increase the probability per unit of time, wSI,

to have epidemics; as expected, has a critical value to R0 that no epidemic occurs, the so

known herd immunity eﬀect [17]. For the considered parameters of our model, we are at the

After several ﬁttings we found the reasonable expression to the initial average rate: <

rSI >t
R0 is so: R0 = N − I0[1 + 1/ < rSI >t

have no epidemics for any value of p0. At ﬁrst sight it might be a strange result, however,

if the initial state has most infected individuals, the removal chance of some is high; so it

decreases faster than the number of infections itself.

The ﬁgure 2 show some epidemic and non epidemic cases obtained by Dynamical Monte

Carlo. This direct method was used to ﬁnd the threshold line of the phase diagrams showed

in the ﬁgure 1. The very beginning of the process is suﬃcient to determine R0, but for

completeness we showed the epidemic curves in an extended time.

In summary, we presented a stochastic version for the parameter R0, based on the descrip-

tion of the SIR model, by means of the Master equation formalism. This way, the predictive

power R0 is transported from deterministic to the stochastic one, generalizing the concept.

In fact, a very deﬁned result to the threshold curve was earlier found to deterministic sys-

tems; it is interesting that we can have this, also, for stochastic systems. It is consequence

of the deﬁnition of R0, whose diﬀerence with that one of already cited recent work [13] did

decrease the threshold. Fluctuations to favor epidemics in our case when R0 < 1 are smaller

than those favor non-epidemics, i.e., the number of non-epidemic cases prevails, even for

ﬁnite small systems; the same happens with the opposite case. Complex geometries can be

included in this model, since have no restrictions to the model in this sense, and the system

geometry is an important factor to change the threshold. If the system is strongly depen-

dent on the initial conditions, the averages are not appropriated to predict an epidemic. We

believe that this deﬁnition of R0 open the doors for new investigations and calculations of

R0 for more realistic systems because we used a general microscopic description to get a

parameter of macroscopic nature.

an epidemic outbreak, for R0 smaller than 1 the infection fade-out. The threshold to the

noisy contour map (M = 10) is in the interval 1.03 − 1.05 that is too small to show in the

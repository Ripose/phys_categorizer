Abstract

We study the eﬀects of channel-particle interactions on microscopic nonequilibrium single-ﬁle

transport through soft nanochannels. A dual switching criticality picture is suggested to describe

the correlation of channel gating with particle transport. To establish the relation between micro-

scopic criticality and macroscopic quantities, for example, bulk concentration of solute particles,

we simulated the mean residence number of solute particle inside one channel as a function of its

bulk concentration, based on a one-dimensional lattice model. We found that this behavior ﬁt well

to ﬁrst-order Langmuir isotherm. Considering a system conﬁguration resembling real experimental

setup, we established phenomenological models based on the proposed dual criticality picture, to

show how to correlate channel gating with single-ﬁle transport in DNA nanocompartment system.

These numerical calculations were then used to reproduce our recent experimental results based

on equilibrium measurements, and showed good consistence. The modeling showed how micro-

scopic nonequilibrium processes lead to macroscopic equilibrium consequence. We ﬁnally discuss

the limitation of this theoretical investigation and its possible improvements.

I. INTRODUCTION

Single-ﬁle transport of microscopic particles, including atoms, ions, molecules, and col-

loids, through nanochannels is signiﬁcant to both fundamental biological processes and in-

dustrial applications [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Many-body statistical properties

of single-ﬁle transport have been documented in both general context [2, 3, 4, 5] and spe-

cial cases [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Most of these works consider steady state ﬂux through

nanochannels determined by the concentration and potential gradient [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and

even nonequilibrium ﬂuctuations [9], with neglecting the ﬂexibility of channels. However,

nonequilibrium single-ﬁle transport is missing with considering simultaneously conforma-

tional changes of nanochannels exserted by channel-particle interactions. In this study, we

investigate theoretically the microscopic nonequilibrium single-ﬁle transport through ﬂexible

nanochannels, given that the channel-particle interactions have indispensable nonequilibrium

eﬀect on the microscopic process of permeation and gating. To achieve a comparison be-

tween theoretical prediction and experiments, we study this problem on a concrete instance,

i.e., DNA nanocompartment channels. We expect that this study will be helpful to improve

our understanding to other nanochannels. We claim that this theoretical paper is an extend

detailed version of our recent Letter that addresses the same problem both theoretically and

experimentally [45].

Studies on DNA in the last decade have extend DNA from genetic materials to generic

materials [13, 14]. DNA has been used to assemble nanostructure [15], nanodevice [16, 17],

and nanofabrication template [18, 19]. With the emergence of active DNA nanocompartment

(ADNC), DNA channels resembling protein channels can be formed in two-dimensional

assembly of double helix on solid substrates. The concept of reversibly switchable ADNC

on surfaces is sketched in Fig. 1(a) [20, 21]. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) capped with a

short piece of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) can form a switching nanocompartment on

gold surface by a compact array of DNA molecules. The high density packing of dsDNA caps

and low density packing of ssDNA spacers establishes a nanometer height compartment. One

major character of the ADNC is to switch between oﬀ and on states by hybridization (closing)

and denaturation (opening). For a closed state ADNC with well-formed dsDNA membrane,

experiments have shown that molecules with a size larger than 1 nm are impermeable through

the dsDNA membrane at equilibrium states [21], because apertures between nearest neighbor

molecules are in a diameter of about

1 nm. However, owing to the hydrophilicity of

dsDNA molecules, small particles such as Na+, K+, Mg2+ and H2O molecules are permeable

∼

through the dsDNA membrane. As the two-dimensional columnar assembly of dsDNA

molecules in buﬀer solution is in a soft condensed matter form, each dsDNA molecule can

have more motion freedom relative to solid condensed matter. This character can allow

the intermolecular apertures to ﬂuctuate between 1

3 nm, which may transiently form

conducting channels with respect to the small particles with 1

2 nm size. In this theoretical

∼

contribution, we focus on this nontrivial non-equilibrium transport phenomena based on a

dual-criticality picture.

In this paper we ﬁrst investigate the thermodynamics of DNA channel deformation with

analytic model, as presented in Section II. It forms the basis of stochastic dynamics of DNA

channels, which is the key to its non-equilibrium transport phenomena.

In Section III,

we describe our proposed dual-criticality picture based on the stochastic dynamics of DNA

channels. In this picture, we relate a single critical microscopic friction to two critical micro-

scopic forces that cause non-equilibrium gating of DNA channels. To establish the relation

between microscopic critical condition with macroscopic quantity, in Section IV, we simulate

the mean residence number of transporter particles inside a channel as a function of the con-

centration gradient of the particles on the both side of a channel. The results ﬁt much well

to Langmiur isotherm that thermodynamically represents single-site binding model. This

relation allows the two microscopic forces to determine two macroscopic concentrations. To

apply the dual-criticality picture to solve a relatively real dynamic process corresponding

to experimental system, in Section V, we establish a phenomenological analytical model to

describe our recent experimental system, and numerically obtained the critical concentra-

tions, which can well ﬁt to experimental measurements. In the ﬁnal Section of this paper, we

discuss the limitation of this study, and further suggest the possible approaches to improve

the dual-criticality picture and extend it to more widespread theoretical applications.

II. ANALYTIC MODEL FOR THE FREE ENERGY OF DNA CHANNEL

DNA channels formed in two-dimensional columnar assembly of dsDNA molecules, typ-

ically shown in Fig. 2, has complex conformational landscape, which depends on a large

number of microscopic degrees of freedom that are analytically intractable. Although one

could solve a precise conformational landscape by classical molecular dynamics, this does

h

not help with answering the problem of this study. We need to ﬁnd a minimal model that

captures the main characteristics of the DNA channels, based on which we can show complex

coupling of channel gating with ﬂux pumping. We consider that the Gibbs free energy of

one DNA channel comprises three contributions: (1) the elastic energy between the dsDNA

molecules that form the channel, which can be written as 1

r0)2, where r is the radius

2B(r

−

of the DNA channel, r0 is the channel radius at original closed state, and B is the elastic

modulus; (2) the potential caused by line tension along the edge of the channel, f L, where

f is line tension, and L is the circumference of the channel; (3) the potential caused by area

tension across the in-plane area of the channel, γA, where γ is the area tension, and A is

the in-plane area. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy describing the deformation of the DNA

channel is

UC =

B(r

r0)2 + f L + γA + U0.

1
2

−

(1)

where U0 is the absolute free energy when we remove all the three contributions.

The elastic modulus in the ﬁrst item of Eq. (1) have two contributions. One contribution

comes from the intermolecular interaction. The other comes from the ssDNA skeletons that

immobilized on the surface, which acts like a pendulum in solution. Both of the contri-

butions approximate the Hooke’s law at second order. The former part can be asymptoti-

cally calculated from Kornyshev-Leikin theory [26, 27, 28, 29] for DNA interactions using
B1 = ∂2UKL(r=r0)
sion of dsDNA membrane surface against the gold surface. The later part can be estimated

. The dsDNA membrane is in a electric ﬁeld E originating from the repul-

∂r2

by B2 =

2σE
h , where σ is the mean charge of each dsDNA molecule, and h is the height of

the reservoir of the nanocompartment, i.e., the contour length of ssDNA skeleton.

q

The line tension in the second item of Eq.

(1) is positive when the DNA channel is

dilated.

It also consists of two dominant contributions, thickness deformation and spon-

taneous curvature. The thickness deformation is induced by the conformational incline

relative to the normal direction of the membrane surface. The thickness deformation energy
is G1 = fU ·
of DNA length, and U is half the conformational incline as deﬁned in Fig. 2. The area of

2πr, where K is an eﬀective elastic modulus and is independent

2πr = 1

2KU 2

·

the part of the DNA membrane that is deformed by channel dilation is roughly equal to

the circumference of the channel times an elastic decay length. The free energy induced

by spontaneous curvature comes from locally increasing the curvature stress generated by

5

DNA columnar packing along its self-assembly surface. The radial dependent of this free

energy is linear, because the eﬀect is localized around the channel. Because the two side of

the DNA membrane are asymmetric, with one side linked to solid surface, the spontaneous

curvature of the top and bottom leaﬂets C± can be very diﬀerent. It can work in terms

of the composite spontaneous curvature of membrane near the channel, C

1

2(C+ −

≡

C−).

The contribution of the deformation energy induced by spontaneous curvature is given by
2πr, where H ′ is the midplane slope and KB is the bending
G2 = fC ·
modulus, which roughly scales as the third power of the membrane thickness.

2πr = KBCH ′

·

The area tension in the third item of Eq.

(1) comes from the repulsive tendency of

the DNA molecules surrounding the channel. When the channel is dilated, it causes the

compression of the two-dimensional packing of the surrounding DNA molecules. This eﬀect

make the area tension is positive as the form written in Eq. (1).

After the rearrangement of these items, the Gibbs free energy of DNA channel deforma-

tion can be written explicitly in terms of the channel radius as

2Br2

has been used to analyze the gating of protein channels [25, 35]. However, the area tensions

and line tensions in our case and in the case of protein channels have diﬀerent sign. These

treatment to the free energy of DNA channel deformation is borrowed from the elastic theory

of lipid bilayer membrane [22, 25, 30, 35]. So this model is coarse-graining, which means

that we neglect a few degrees of freedom that conformationally diﬀer from the lipid bilayer

membrane. However, it can help with a theory working analytically or semi-analytically.

III. DUAL CRITICALITY OF DNA CHANNEL GATING

In previous Section, we have established a coarse-graining model that can represent the

free energy of channel deformation as a function of channel radius. This representation sim-

pliﬁes the dynamic analysis of channel switching under external perturbation. Mechanosensi-

tive protein channels usually adopt a bistable conformational deformation energy [25, 34, 35].

Although its open state is triggered by external mechanical perturbation, the open state is

6

usually not considered sensitive to the pressure exerted by transporter particles. DNA chan-

nels in our model system of DNA nanocompartment have diﬀerent characteristics. They have

implications for a open state that is mechanically sensitive to interactions between channel

and transporter particles. This eﬀect could contribute more non-equilibrium eﬀect on the

channel gating.

Let us assume that the conformational stochastic dynamics between the open and closed

states of a DNA channel can be described in terms of a one-dimensional reaction coordinate

dynamics x(t) = r

r0 in a conformational potential Uc(x + r0). The Fokker-Plank equation

where p(x, t) represents the PDF of ﬁnding the channel state in reaction coordinate x at

Φ(x, t) = Uc(x + r0) + F (t)x. In the Smoluchowski approximation of FPE one assumes the

functional form p(x, t) = √αβ exp [

Due the symmetry between ω and D in Eq. (6), the relation between the hysteresis and D

Experiments have show that metal ions (Na+, K+) and water molecules can transport

through a free DNA channel, which have a diameter estimated to be about 0.5

1 nm. It is

∼

trivial to study the transport behavior of these ions and molecules. We focus on the small

particles with a radius rp comparable to the radius r0 of the free DNA channels, which can

not transport through the free DNA channels at equilibrium state under low concentration

gradient. To understand the switching of DNA channel with respect to these small particles,

we have to clarify the interactions between DNA channels and particles.

Imagine the scenario that one solute particle with radius rp resides right in the center of

However, it was shown that simulation based on the potential can produce result agreeing

with experimental observation of single-ﬁle diﬀusion across nanochannel [32]. According to

Eq. (7), when r < rc the channel-particle interactions provide a suﬃciently large friction

friction γ exists, allowing the particle to transport through the channel. We refer to rc as

critical radius or switching radius. Figure 4 illustrates the three cases for the conformation

of DNA channel. The critical radius provide a microscopic mechanism for the transport

behavior of solute particles across the DNA membrane.

Mapping the critical radius to the external force applied on DNA channel can show how

F (t) causes the switching of the DNA channel. As shown in Fig. 5, when the inside driving

force F (t) is large enough, the switching radius can exist in the range of radius variation, and

it thereby determines two diﬀerent critical forces, i.e., Fo causing the opening of the channel

during the increasing phase (F+(t)), and Fc causing the closing of the channel during the
decreasing phase of (F−(t)). For a dynamic hysteresis of the type as Eq. (3), Fo ≥

holds. Thus, for a periodic external driving force F (t)a sin(ωt), the DNA channel can be

opened when F (t) > Fo, and closed when F (t) < Fc, which relates the switching of DNA

channel to its stochastic dynamics.

To provide an in-depth understanding to the critical forces, please note that in Fig. 5 the

trajectory of DNA channel conformation is mean value over a large number of individual

trajectories. A single trajectory without average treatment contains stochasticity originated

from Gaussian noise and system ﬂuctuation. Thus, a single real trajectory of DNA channel

can result in diﬀerent critical forces compared to those shown in Fig. 5. Actually, the

critical forces determined in the mean trajectory of DNA channel should be understood as

mean critical forces averaged from a large number of individual trajectories.

If we have

experimental method to measure the critical forces in single trajectory of DNA channel,

the measured data should have indispensable ﬂuctuation consistent to stochastic factors in

Fokker-Plank equations.

CHANNEL

IV. THE MEAN RESIDENCE NUMBER OF SOLUTE PARTICLE INSIDE THE

Before we can couple the channel gating with single-ﬁle transportation, the microscopic

switching criticality should be related to macroscopic quantity. This problem is equivalent

10

to that how the diﬀerent concentration gradient provide microscopic external force on the

channel. The ﬁrst step towards the solution is to clarify how many particles inside the

channel at a time at given concentration gradient. Since the transmembrane pores have

radii comparable to solute particles, we use a one-dimensional exclusion model to describe

the single-ﬁle particle ﬂows [2, 3, 4, 24]. Consider the nanopore shown in Fig. 6, with solute

particles driven from left (inner) to right (external) by osmotic pressure of by hydrostatic

pressure. A single-ﬁle channel is divided into M sections labeled i, each of length l &

diameters of solute particles. The site of particle in the left reservoir is labeled i = 0, and

that in the right reservoir is labeled i = M +1. The occupation of particles at site i is deﬁned
by τi ∈ {
reservoir is P01dt if site i = 1 is unoccupied. Similarly, the probability that a particle gets

out of the channel into left reservoir in time dt is P10dt. As shown in Fig. 6, the entrance

and exit probability for a particle in the right reservoir in time dt is similarly deﬁned as

PM,M +1dt and PM +1,M dt. In the channel interior, solute particles move from site i to i

with probability per unit time Pi,i±1 only if the adjacent site is unoccupied, i.e., τi±1 = 0.

Under the approximation of a uniform and isotropic channel, we can simplify Pi,i±1 to Pc.

Microscopic thermodynamics in the channel-particle system involves three time scales.

The ﬁrst is the mean time between two adjacent events that a particle inside the channel

collides with either the adjacent particles or the interior surface of the channel, deﬁned as

tc. The second is the mean time that the absolute residence number of solute particles ﬁlled

in the channel change its value one time, deﬁned as tn. And the third is the time scale

over which we average the accurately simulated residence number of particles in the channel

interior, deﬁned as ts. If we assume that local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is satisﬁed

are activation energies for solute particles to realize the corresponding position variation.

For a soft nanochannel, which can change its conformation responding to the change of

the mean residence number (n) of particle in the channel interior, all the kinetic rates and

corresponding activation energies are the functions of n. For an illustrative example, we

assume microscopically symmetric channel, i.e., P01 = PM +1,M , and P10 = PM,M +1.

To simulate and calculate the statistical quantity of mean residence number of particles

inside a DNA channel as a function of concentration gradient applied on both sides of the

channel, the ﬁrst step is to count the number of microstates of the system and determine

the transition probabilities between two adjacent states. The microstates are represented as

site to its adjacent site, weighted by corresponding transition probability, if the adjacent site

is not occupied. We set tc = 1, then the time scale of ﬁlling number variation, tn, would be

in 103

104 order of magnitude. Thus, the system will deﬁnitely achieve the equilibrium

state and a stable distribution of particles after t = 108. After that, we measure the mean

residence number in a time interval of ts = 109, and thus obtain the simulated data. If a

large amount of simulated data is obtained under the same condition, we ﬁnd that the data

obey a Gaussian distribution without obvious deviation.

The mean residence number ¯n as a function of the concentration gradient is simulated,

with temperature ﬁxed at 300K. In the simulations, the concentration of solute particle in

external solution is ﬁxed at 0.1 mM, while the concentration in nanocompartment varies

from 0 to 20 mM. Figure 8 shows the typical simulation results for the case of M = 4, 5, 6.

The mean residence number under diﬀerent concentration gradient can ﬁt well to Langmuir

isotherm. In Fig. 9, we further change the kinetic rates to test the eﬀect on the simulations.

It shows that the association constant in Langmuir isotherm does not change seriously at

most cases. We observe that ﬂuctuation in simulated data decrease seriously with increasing

the entrance, exit, and hopping probabilities. In Figs. 9(c),(d),(e), the simulated data ﬁt

14

fairly well to the Eq. (16) as shown below. The simulated Langmuir isotherms are well

reasonable and theoretically expected. Actually, if LTE condition are well satisﬁed in a

single-ﬁle channel system, the mean residence number should obey a single-site occupation

mode, which mathematically is the same as single-site binding mode, i.e., ﬁrst-order Lang-

muir isotherm. Using equilibrium statistical mechanics based on partition function weighted

by binding energies of each site, one can exactly work out a ﬁrst-order Langmuir isotherm
relation between ¯n and C = ci −

To relate the microscopic switching criticality to macroscopic quantity, we consider that

F (t) only comes from the channel-particle interactions. It is reasonable to propose that F (t)

is related to the mean residence number ¯n(t) of the particles inside the channel by a linear

form

where ¯f is the eﬀective mean force of single particle exerted on the channel surface. The

next step is to ﬁnd the relation between ¯n(t) and C(t). The relation can be denoted by

¯n(t) = ζ(C(t)). The real form of ζ(x) is dependent of the intrinsic properties of both

channel and particle and their interactions. If the change of C(t) in time scale ts is enough

small, the ζ-relations can be asymptotically adopted as Eq. (15). Since Eqs. (16) and (18)

establish monotonically increasing functions between F (t) and C(t), the two critical forces

(Fo, Fc) deﬁne two critical concentration C(t) by

V. COUPLING OF CHANNEL GATING WITH SINGLE-FILE FLUX PUMPING

We consider how particles with a radius comparable to the radius of the channel transport

through the dsDNA membrane in the viewpoint of time evolution. Given that the channel

is in equilibrium state at time t = 0, the concentration diﬀerence of the particles on the

two sides of a DNA channel increases along certain function ∆C(t) where ∆C(0) = 0. The
process of the ﬂux establishment involves two stages according. In the ﬁrst stage, C(t) < C ∗
o ,

so that the particles have no suﬃcient chemical potential to transport through the channel.

Even though the particles can penetrate into the channels, they are soon trapped in the
channels without ﬂux established. In the second stage, C(t) > C ∗

o , and the concentration
diﬀerence allows the particles trapped in the channels form a concerted motion to establish

a transport ﬂux. This Section is devoted to provide a mathematical description to the whole

process, which is based on our recent experiments.

During the process, the channel will change its conformation from a closed state to an

open state. This conformational transition can change the dynamics of single-ﬁling particles

transporting the pore. Reversely, the single-ﬁling ﬂux can also interact with channel to

trigger conformational transition of the channel or maintain its conformational state. The

dynamics of the system should involve both the channel and all particles transported. To

show the dynamics of channels and particles in a coupling way, we notice that the Fokker-

Plank equations describing the counterparts should be considered simultaneously rather

than independently. This implies that the simulation study on ζ-relations is not enough,

and we should further investigate the kinetic behavior of steady-state ﬂux when channels

are opened.

Single-ﬁle Brownian motion of solute particles along a narrow channel is in the over-

damped limit of one-dimensional Langevin dynamics [5, 9, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42], described by

In the steady state, the ﬂux is constant throughout the channel

open channels should not exceed the total area increase of the DNA membrane, which have

a physical limit owing to the covalent binding on substrate surface.

To show how the single-ﬁle ﬂux pumping is coupled with the channel gating, we suppose

that C(t) initiates from a value C(t = 0) = C1 < C ∗

(22). Therefore, by coupling Eq.

(26) with Eqs.

(4) and (20), a

typical complete dynamic process determined by hysteresis is numerically generated in Fig.

10. Figure 10(a) shows the time evolution of C(t) and j(t). Figure 10(b) exhibits how rc =
r0 + 0.56 (nm) can cause C ∗

c = 3.29 mM. This calculation ﬁt well to

o = 18.32 mM and C ∗

the data from the experiments [45].

This numerical calculation can be more precise by using more accurate C(t) and N(t)

functions, which can make the discontinuity of ﬁrst-order derivative of C(t), j(t), and

i
vs. C(t) to become continuous at critical points. Typically, N(t) can be reﬁned by using the

x(t)

probability of channel opening, Po =

1+exp(−β∆UC ) , where ∆UC is the change of deformation
energy during the channel opening [1, 47, 48]. However, the main features will not change

1

under these detailed improvements. While current experimental techniques are far away from

observation on the detailed dynamics, we do not work much further on these improvements.

Theoretically, these improvements can not essentially promote the quality of this study.

The general calculation method used to couple the gating of soft nanochannel with single-

ﬁle ﬂux pumping of solute particles can be summarized as following procedures:

(1) To estimate the critical radius of channel switching from the channel radius and

particle sizes;

(2) To ﬁnd the increasing phase of the concentration gradient across the channel;

(3) To determine the opening critical concentration gradient according to critical radius

by solving the Eq. (4) of the soft nanochannel dynamics corresponding to the increasing

phase of the concentration gradient;

(4) To ﬁnd the decreasing phase of the concentration gradient across the channel;

by solving the Eq. (4) of the soft nanochannel dynamics corresponding to the decreasing

phase of the concentration gradient.

In the numerical calculation, we neglect some intrinsic complexity that is not important

for the points studied here. First, we do not take into account the defects as an important af-

fection to the macroscopic eﬀects. In a real surface of ADNC device, random microstructure

or even nanostructure may contribute speciﬁc eﬀect. Experiments showed that this eﬀect is

20

(cid:13)
on the continuous small decrease of measured C(t), which does not aﬀect the pumping eﬀect

during a whole switching process that experimentally results in a steep drop in C(t). Sec-

ond, the microscopic behavior of molecules inside nanocompartment may be very diﬀerent

from those in the bulk solution. Although we never add this eﬀect due to its elusiveness and

still under investigation, this deﬁciency does not aﬀect the major character of the transport

mechanism described here, and also does not contribute speciﬁc eﬀect on experiments.

VI. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

This study starts from the microscopic thermodynamics of single DNA channels and

ends at coupling of channel gating with single-ﬁle ﬂux pumping. Although the theoretical

modeling includes a few coarse-graining treatment, we have established a minimal model

to unify the channel gating and single-ﬁle ﬂux pumping into one picture. The model is

further veriﬁed by our recent experiments [45]. While being put into simplicity, there can be

several ways to improve and enrich this picture. For example, we can further ask whether the

asymmetry of DNA channel during its gating could contribute nontrivial eﬀect on the single-

ﬁle transport, whether the critical radius shifts according to the concentration gradient, and

so on. One would notice that these questions can raise nontrivial tasks to ﬁnd right answers.

So they remain for the future studies.

In Section IV, the simulated isotherms for the mean residence number ¯n of solute par-

ticle inside a channel seem to have trivial results that ﬁt to Lamguir isotherm, which can

be exactly derived from equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, our simulation is not

based on equilibrium statistical mechanics, but one-dimensional exclusion transport model,

which is typically nonequilibrium transport. Therefore, an interesting conclusion can be

made, that if measurement on ¯n does not distinguish the diﬀerence between individual par-

ticles, the ¯n averaging over a time interval that is wide enough on the steady-state ﬂux of a

one-dimensional nonequilibrium transport is equivalent to static occupation of equilibrium

particles along the channel. Another reason for this conclusion is that during the measure-

ment of ¯n isotherms, the roles of the left and right reservoirs are the same, so that their

exchange of particle with channel can be treated as a whole, which results in that steady-

state ﬂux is equivalent to zero net exchange number between channel and the reservoirs as

a whole. This conclusion also shows the reasonability of applying a equilibrium statistical

21

mechanical method on the mathematical derivation of ¯n isotherms. This can also explain

why the changes of probabilities of entrance, exit, and hopping of particles relative to the

channel do not seriously aﬀect the simulated association constant.

Although focusing on the case of DNA-formed nanochannels, we emphasize that the

nonequilibrium single-ﬁle pumping dynamics investigated here is not limited to this case,

which provides a general framework to describe the dynamics of many other soft nanochan-

nels. First, similar gating thermodynamics is also adopted by mechanosensitive protein

channels [25, 35]. Second, the fundamental behavior of single-ﬁle penetration isotherms

and ﬂux hysteresis simulated do not highly rely on the speciﬁc properties of DNA.

Third, Some of its modeling also have direct implication for other nanochannels. Even

though the mechanosensitive protein channels [49] have various detailed gating mecha-

nism [30, 34, 35, 36, 37], these studies most neglect the ﬂexibility of channels and do not

exclude out the eﬀect of the ﬂexibility on the channel gating dynamics. Therefore, this

study is well complementary to current studies on protein channel gating and transporta-

tion [2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 51, 52], as

well as non-soft molecular sieves [6, 7, 8, 11].

The main idea of this study is that by dynamic hysteresis one microscopic critical condi-

tion leads to dual criticality corresponding to the conjugate segments of the time evolution

trajectory in the regime far away from thermodynamic equilibrium states, which can be rep-

resented by both microscopic and macroscopic quantities. Fluctuation theorem (FT) [50]

have shown that the probability density function π(sτ ) of a phase space trajectory is deviated

from its time reversal trajectory π(

sτ ) by relations typically like π(sτ )/π(

sτ ) = exp(τ sτ ),

−

−

where sτ is the entropy production rate. It is also valid for stochastic dynamics [53, 54, 55]

that can describe many biological and nano-mechanical systems. It was further shown that

the transient ﬂuctuation theorem are in quantitative agreements with Langevin dynam-

ics [56]. Note that it is Langevin dynamics causing the hysteresis during the switching of

soft channels. Since the origin of dynamic hysteresis is in the same principle of FT, our dual

criticality model may ﬁnd widespread valid variations in other biological and nanometer

systems, e.g., protein channels and soft molecular sieves.

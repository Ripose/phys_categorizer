Abstract. We review the properties of biological motor proteins which move along
linear ﬁlaments that are polar and periodic. The physics of the operation of such motors
can be described by simple stochastic models which are coupled to a chemical reaction.
We analyze the essential features of force and motion generation and discuss the general
properties of single motors in the framework of two-state models. Systems which contain
large numbers of motors such as muscles and ﬂagella motivate the study of many
interacting motors within the framework of simple models. In this case, collective eﬀects
can lead to new types of behaviors such as dynamic instabilities of the steady states
and oscillatory motion.

1 Introduction

An essential and striking features of living cells is their ability to generate mo-
tion and forces. Important examples are cell motility, the contraction of muscles
but also active phenomena within cells that allow for material transport and the
motion of organelles, for example during cell division and mitose. These move-
ments and forces are generated on the molecular level by protein molecules that
are driven by chemical reactions in a far from equilibrium situation. Important
examples are motor proteins, enzymes which are specialized to work as motors.
In eucariotic cells, several families of motor proteins exist which interact with the
cytoskeleton, a complex three-dimensional elastic network of long rod-like ﬁla-
ments inside the cell which is essential for the mechanical stability and integrity
of the cell [1].

A motor protein of the cytoskeleton interacts speciﬁcally with a certain type
of ﬁlament along which it is able to move in presence of Adenosinetriphosphate
(ATP) which is a chemical fuel. The ﬁlaments serve as guides or tracks for the
motion. Two types of ﬁlaments play this role: microtubules and actin ﬁlaments.
Both are formed by a polymerization process from identical monomers (actin
and tubulin monomers, respectively), leading to a regular and periodic struc-
ture. An important feature is their polarity: The ﬁlaments are asymmetric with
respect to their two ends. This symmetry has its origin in the asymmetry of the
monomers which form a polar ﬁlament structure with two diﬀerent ends which
are denoted “plus end” and “minus end”. This polar symmetry is essential for
motor operation as it deﬁnes the direction of motion. Motor proteins are clas-
siﬁed into several families: myosins, kinesins and dyneins. Myosins move always

2

along actin ﬁlaments and towards the plus end. Kinesins and dyneins move along
microtubules, kinesins move towards the plus end and dyneins towards the minus
end, see Fig. 1.

of ﬁlaments are polar and periodic, their two diﬀerent ends are denoted “plus” and
“minus”.

Myosins are prominent for their role in the contraction of muscles [2, 3]. In
this case, many myosin molecules form a linear structure, a myosin ﬁlament,
which interacts with actin ﬁlaments arranged in parallel. The action of myosin
motors then induces the relative sliding of the two types of ﬁlaments. In muscle
cells, a very large number of ﬁlaments is organized in a regular way which on a
macroscopic scale leads to the muscular contraction. Myosins also occur within
normal cells where they play an important role for cell motility and the organi-
zation of actin. Kinesins occur in large numbers in neurons, where they play a
key role in transport of vesicles along the axon towards the synapse. Both types
of motors have two identical heads of a size of about 10-20nm which are the
elementary force-generating elements as well as a tail which is used to attach
the motor to another structure [4].

The energy source of this process is the hydrolysis reaction AT P → ADP +P
of ATP to ADP and Phosphate (P). The motor protein M (or more precisely,
the head domain containing the ATP binding site) undergoes a chemical cycle: it
binds ATP and hydrolizes the bound ATP. Subsequently it releases the products
ADP and P. We denote the diﬀerent chemical states by M, M-ATP, M-ADP-P,
and M-ADP, respectively. After completion of the cycle (M+ATP → M-ATP →
M-ADP-P→ M-ADP+P → M+ADP+P) the motor is unchanged. However, dur-
ing this process it has undergone conformational changes and it has hydrolyzed
one ATP molecule, see Fig. 2. The diﬀerent conformations which occur during

the chemical cycle in general have diﬀerent geometries and properties and can in
particular have diﬀerent interaction characteristics with respect to the ﬁlament
[5]. As a result, the motor protein undergoes chemistry-driven changes between
strongly and more weakly bound states (“attachments” and “detachments”).
This coupling between chemistry and binding permits the creation of motion
along a polar ﬁlament [6, 7, 8].

The force and motion generation of individual or groups of motor proteins
can be studied experimentally by a variety of techniques. In so-called motility
assays, motors are attached to a substrate [9, 10, 11, 12]. Filaments in solution
bind to the motors and in presence of ATP start moving along the surface.
In these experiments typically several or many motors interact with a single
ﬁlament.

In order to observe the forces generated by an individual motor, the pro-
cessivity of the motor becomes important. Myosin is not processive. During the
chemical cycle it detaches from the ﬁlament during a signiﬁcant period of time.
During this time it can easily diﬀuse away from the ﬁlament if it is not held
in place. Forces generated by single myosin molecules have been observed by
diﬀerent techniques, see Fig. 3 (a) and (b). Micron sized bead have been coated
with low density of motors and optical traps have been used to bring a ﬁlament
in contact with the bead and possibly only a single motor [13]. Forces on the
ﬁlament are then measured by observing the displacement in the trap. Another
possibility is to ﬁx the actin and to manipulate the bead with an optical trap.
Such experiments reveal that the motor induces stochastic displacements of the
order of 5 − 10nm which last for several milliseconds and peak forces of the order
of 1pN [11, 13].

Kinesin, is a processive motor [14]. A single kinesin moves along microtubules
for a distance of the order of micrometers before losing the ﬁlament. Motion of
single kinesin molecules can therefore be observed directly, either by attaching

a small bead to the motor and observing the displacement of the bead or by
directly marking the molecule with a ﬂuorescent dye. Optical traps have been
used to study the velocity of motion as a function of an applied load [15]. It
has been shown, that kinesin moves in a step-wise fashion with characteristic
steps of 8nm size [16]. This step size coincides with the period of kinesin binding
sites along microtubules which demonstrates that the ATP-driven reaction cycle
induces steps between periodically spaced binding sites. The characteristic time-
scales for kinesin motion are milliseconds and forces up to 5pN are generated
[15, 17].

The standard explanation for the processivity of Kinesin is based on the
fact that each molecule consists of two head domains which both hydrolize ATP
and undergo the chemical cycle in a coordinated way [14, 19]. In this situation,
processivity is possible if both heads very rarely detach from the ﬁlament at
the same time thus allowing the motor to keep attached while displacing. Single
heads do have the capability to generate forces and motion but in most cases are
not processive. Recent experiments however show evidence that single kinesin
heads can move processively in certain cases [20]. Myosin molecules also often
have two heads. However, even with two heads they do not become processive
since every myosin head has a tendency under normal operating conditions to
be unbound during about 90% of its chemical cycle.

From the point of view of a general classiﬁcation of the physical mechanisms
which can lead to motion generation, motor proteins fall in a class of systems

(cid:13)
Force and Motion Generation of Molecular Motors: A Generic Description

characterized by the fact that they operate on molecular scales and generate
motion along a one-dimensional polar and periodic structure (sometimes called
ratchet [21]) by a non-equilibrium rectiﬁcation process [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30]. For a system on a molecular scale, ﬂuctuations play an important
role for its function and properties. These ﬂuctuations can be both of thermal
origin or they can arise due to the stochasticity of individual molecule chemical
reactions. Therefore, a theoretical description requires the use of concepts of non-
equilibrium statistical physics. Biological motor proteins are the most prominent
examples for these systems. However, there is a growing number of artiﬁcially
designed “molecular motors” [31, 32, 33, 34], suggesting that the physics of these
systems is relevant for micro-and nano-technological devices.

In the subsequent sections, we describe a simple modelization of the generic
aspects of these systems, using biological motor proteins as a guide. In section
2 we introduce the basic concepts of such a modelization. Properties of single
motor motion which follow from this description are described in Sect. 3. In
section 4, we discuss the consequences of many motor systems and demonstrate
that new phenomena such as dynamical instabilities follow naturally from these
models. Finally, we present in section 5 a discussion and an outlook.

2 Simpliﬁed models

In order to keep the description simple and to focus on generic properties, we do
not aim to capture microscopic structural details of biological motor proteins.
We use a simpliﬁed picture taking into account the periodicity and polarity of the
linear track and the fact that during the chemical cycle conformational changes
occur [8].

The main assumption required for this simpliﬁcation is a separation of time-
scales [6, 8]. Even though a macromolecule like a protein is characterized by
a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom, most of them relax on time
scales shorter than the typical relevant time scales for the chemical cycle. These
degrees of freedom are therefore to a good approximation thermally equilibrated.
Only a few slow degrees of freedom have to be described by dynamical equations.
These relevant degrees of freedom are collective modes of the system. Examples
are chemical reaction coordinates but also the overall position variable of the
motor with respect to the ﬁlament. The latter is important in order to describe
the coupling between chemistry and motion.

2.1 Energy landscapes and chemical transition rates

Following Ref. [6], we assume for simplicity that the chemistry of a single head
can be described by a number m of discrete states or conformations i = 1..m.
Many biochemical models focus on the four states M, M-ATP, M-ADP-P, M-
ADP but other reaction intermediates could also be included [6, 35]. Transitions
between these states are fast compared to the typical time between transitions

6

Frank J¨ulicher

and the mechanical action or motion of the motor. Therefore we use a chemical
kinetics description for changes between states.

If we consider a motor in conformation i, we can deﬁne a potential or inter-
action energy proﬁle along the ﬁlament. Suppose that one small region of the
motor, e.g. in the tail, is used to transmit forces or to attach a cargo. We imag-
ine this point to be held at a position x along the ﬁlament. We can now deﬁne
Wi(x) to be the energy of the motor, including possibly bound ATP, ADP or P,
and including the energy of the ﬁlament as the motor is held at position x. This
total energy is in fact an eﬀective free energy deﬁned formally by integrating
over all rapidly relaxing microscopic degrees of freedom but keeping the enzyme
in its chemical state. The conformation of the system motor-ﬁlament is then
fully characterized by the pair {i, x} of internal state and position with respect
to the ﬁlament. Note, that the potentials reﬂect the symmetry properties of the
ﬁlament. If the ﬁlament is polar and a periodic array of identical monomers,
the potentials are periodic with period l, Wi(x) = Wi(x + l) and asymmetric,
Wi(x) 6= Wi(−x).

In order to describe the dynamics of the system {i, x}(t), we use a stochastic

overdamped dynamics at constant temperature T within a given state i

Here ηi is a protein friction and ζ(t) is a Gaussian white noise in state i with
< ζi(t)ζj(0) >= 2ηiδ(t). The chemical reactions between states {i, x} and {j, x}

occur with Poisson statistics with reaction rates ωij(x). Since the position vari-
able x is also a conformational degree of freedom (the motor in general changes
its shape while displacing), transition rates are in general x-dependent. Note,
that for simplicity in Eq. (2) we have assumed that transitions between states
happen instantaneously and without displacement. Furthermore, we have used
the fact that thermal relaxation is very fast compared to the chemical cycle and
all rapid degrees of freedom are equilibrated at constant temperature T . In fact,
the typical relaxation time of temperature gradients which have developed on a
length scale l can be estimated as τ = Cl2/κ, where C is the speciﬁc heat of
the material per volume and κ the thermal conductivity. Using typical values for
water and length scales of the order of 10nm we ﬁnd τ ≃ 10−6 − 10−8s, which
is fast compared to typical cycle times of several ms. This argument shows that
the motor operates isothermally, i.e. temperature gradients are not created and
cannot be used to generate motion as e.g. in the case of Feynman’s ratchet [21].
It is now convenient to use a Fokker-Planck description [36] and to introduce
distribution functions Pi(x, t) for the probability to ﬁnd within an ensemble of

obey the conservation law ∂tP +∂xJ = 0. The average velocity in the steady state
with stationary and periodic distribution function Pi(x) = Pi(x + l), ∂tPi = 0 is
given by

In order to characterize the chemical rates, we ﬁrst introduce the chemical
potentials of the fuel and hydrolysis products in bulk solution. We denote µAT P ,
µADP and µP the free energy per ATP, ADP or P molecule, respectively. As
an illustrative example, we ﬁrst consider the four chemical states M (i = 1),
M-ATP (i = 2), M-ADP-P (i = 3) and M-ADP (i = 4), often encountered for
biological motor proteins. A general reaction kinetics for all eight reaction rates
which is consistent with the ATP hydrolysis reaction can be written by using
four diﬀerent kinetic coeﬃcients:

ω12 = α1 exp[(W1 + µAT P )/kBT ] ω21 = α1 exp[W2/kBT ]
ω32 = α2 exp[W3/kBT ]
ω23 = α2 exp[W2/kBT ]
ω43 = α3 exp[(W4 + µP )/kBT ]
ω34 = α3 exp[W3/kBT ]
ω14 = α4 exp[(W1 + µADP + µP )/kBT ]
ω41 = α4 exp[(W4 + µP )/kBT ]

,

(8)
Here, we have used the condition of detailed balance of the rates. The functions
αi(x) characterize the possible reaction scenarios. Note, that since transitions
are fast and therefore occur for ﬁxed x, the chemical rates do not depend on
the external force fext or local stresses. Force-dependent are only displacements
described by equation (1). The present modelization diﬀers in this respect from
models which use discrete transitions also to describe displacements. In this case
chemical rates are strain dependent [6, 37, 43]. From a physical point of view,
all models are of course equivalent.

2.2 Two-state models

It is useful to further simplify the generic description introduced above. The
m-state model allows in principle to describe many details of the chemical cycle
and the various conformations of the motor. However, it contains a large number
of free parameters which are unknown. It is therefore useful to further simplify
the model. In fact, in order to describe physical aspects of motion generation
and force generation, it is suﬃcient to keep only two diﬀerent states [24, 26, 27].

well as periodic transition rates ω1 and ω2. Pumping between the two states induces

We rewrite the Fokker-Planck equations (4) for two states i = 1, 2:

∂tP1 + ∂xJ1 = −ω1(x)P1 + ω2(x)P2
∂tP2 + ∂xJ2 = ω1(x)P1 − ω2(x)P2

,

(9)

where we have introduced ω1 = ω12 and ω2 = ω21 and the currents are the same
as introduced in Eq. (4). This system is sketched in Fig. 4 for an example of
shifted periodic and asymmetric potentials.

This two-state model is still very ﬂexible and allows to describe situations
which capture many of the physical aspects of biological protein motors. Fig. 5
shows choice of potentials W1 and W2 adapted to the commonly accepted pic-
ture of myosin function [7]: a myosin head detaches from the actin ﬁlament after
binding ATP. In the unbound state ATP is hydrolyzed (M-ATP→ M-ADP-P).
The head (M-ADP-P) is now again able to bind actin. As it encounters a binding
site along the ﬁlament, it re-attaches under phosphate release. After reattach-
ment, a force-generating step occurs and ADP is released, which completes the
chemical cycle. As illustrated in Fig. 5 this process can be captured by two dif-
ferent potentials, W1 and W2 representing the unbound state (a ﬂat potential)
and the bound state (a potential with periodic structure) respectively. After
the force-generating step (power-stroke), the x variable has reached a potential
minimum. Here, the system can be actively excited to the unbound state under
ATP binding. As it reattaches to the ﬁlament, the slope of the potential reﬂects
the mechanical force generated at this point. A displacement is generated as the

system slides downhill along the energy proﬁle to reach the potential minimum.
Note, that microscopically this displacement could correspond either to a tilt of
the head domain as sketched in the ﬁgure or to other more complex processes.
The microscopic structure associated with this displacement is not characterized
by this description.

In a two-state picture, the chemical reaction cycle as described by the kinetic
equations (8) has to be divided into two substeps. One possibility is to introduce
the forward and backward rates α1 and α2 for the combined process of ATP-
binding and hydrolysis

and the rates β1 and β2 which describe the process of product release and bind-

The complete chemical cycle is now the subsequent transitions α1 and β2. As
long as α2 and β1 are nonzero, there is a nonvanishing probability for an inversion
of the cycle (i.e. ATP generation) by following the steps α2 and β1. We deﬁne
W1 to be the energy of a free motor together with the product molecules (M +
ADP + P) and W2 to be the energy of the complex M-ADP-P. Detailed balance
of the chemical reactions then implies

,

where we have introduced the chemical driving force

∆µ ≡ µAT P − µADP − µP

.

The transition rates of the two-state model are the superpositions ωi = αi + βi.
Introducing two unknown functions α(x) and β(x) which describe conformation
dependent energy barriers, we can therefore write

ω1(x) = α(x)e(W1+∆µ)/kB T + β(x)eW1/kB T
ω2(x) = [α(x) + β(x)]eW2/kB T

.

Note, that other choices to divide the reaction cycle in two relevant substeps
leads to the same result, but redeﬁnes the arbitrary functions α and β and shifts
the potential W2 by a constant value.

The functions α(x) and β(x) deﬁne the coupling of the chemical reaction
to conformation. Very important is the concept of localized or conformation-
dependent transitions where the functions are peaked within a narrow x-interval
but negligible outside this interval. An example is the ATP-binding step which
in Fig. 5 is restricted to occur within an “active region” of conformation space
corresponding to the potential minimum while the conformations at the begin-
ning of a force-generating power stroke are not supposed to bind ATP. As we
will describe in the subsequent sections, the localization of transitions via the
functions α and β plays an important role for many interesting cases.

Similar to the case of myosin, the two state model can also be adapted to
other situations such as the motion of kinesin molecules containing two heads
both of which contain an ATP binding site. In principle, a general description
would require eight internal states and a complex reaction scenario. A possible
simpliﬁcation arises from the idea of a coordinated binding and unbinding of
the two heads in a hand-over-hand fashion as shown schematically in Fig. 6 [14].
Such a coupling would reduce the number of relevant degrees of freedom [38]. In a
two-state model, this feature can be captured in a simpliﬁed way by associating
each state with one of the heads being bound to the ﬁlament. Denoting the
motor with head 1 or head 2 bound to the ﬁlament by M1 and M2, respectively,
we deﬁne the energies of these situations ¯W1 and ¯W2. Because the two heads
forming a kinesin motor are identical, the energy landscapes of both states are

Fig. 6. Hand over hand motion suggested for kinesin. At any time, one head is bound
and the second head moves towards the next binding site. This situation can be repre-
sented by describing both heads by identical but shifted energy landscapes W1(x) and
W2(x).

two identical potential proﬁles which are shifted with respect to each other by one
monomer period l/2 on the ﬁlament: ¯W1(x) = ¯W1(x + l); ¯W2(x) = ¯W1(x + l/2),
see Fig. 6. However, the characteristic step-size of an individual head l in this
picture corresponds to two monomer sizes. Therefore, the potentials ¯Wi are l-
periodic, while the total system is invariant under x → x+l/2 if at the same time
the two states are exchanged. Therefore the transition rates also obey ω1(x) =
ω1(x + l) and ω2(x) = ω1(x + l/2). Again, the idea of active regions and localized
transitions is important. Assuming that all transitions occur at conformations
which correspond to the potential minimum, we obtain a system which operates
in an almost deterministic way where the chemical cycle is closely correlated to
a particular displacement. In the case of non-localized transitions, the chemical
cycle is related to motion in a more irregular way.

A useful representation of the transition rates in the hand-over-hand picture

is to assume that a full ATP hydrolysis cycle changes M1 to M2:

M1 + AT P ⇀↽ M2 + ADP + P .

(16)

Because of the symmetry between the two heads, the reaction M2 + AT P ⇀↽
M1 + ADP + P occurs with the same rates. This leads to the total transition
rates

ω1(x) = e ¯W1(x)/kB T [¯α(x)e ¯∆µ/kB T + ¯α(x + l/2)]
ω2(x) = e ¯W2(x)/kB T [¯α(x)

+ ¯α(x + l/2)e ¯∆µ/kB T }]

.

(17)

12

Frank J¨ulicher

The unknown function ¯α(x) = ¯α(x + l/2) is l-periodic. Note, that the choice
given in Eq. (17) is a special case of Eq. (15) if we identity ∆µ = 2 ¯∆µ, α(x) =
¯α(x)e− ¯∆µ/kB T , β(x) = ¯α(x + l), W2 = ¯W2 + ¯∆µ and W1 = ¯W1. This example
demonstrates that Eq. (15) is a general choice which can describe very diﬀerent
types of couplings of an ATP hydrolysis cycle to a two state model.

We have now deﬁned a two-state model which can describe a system un-
dergoing an ATP hydrolysis cycle and moving along a periodic structure. As
discussed above, this model is suﬃciently ﬂexible to be adapted to situations
which resemble the widely accepted pictures of myosin and kinesin functioning.

3 Single motors

We will now discuss general properties of the two-state model for a single motor
introduced above [26, 39, 40]. Two generalized forces act on the system leading to
an out-of equilibrium situation. These are the chemical “force” ∆µ introduced
in Eq. (14) and the mechanical force fext. If both generalized forces are kept
constant, the system eventually attains a steady state with ∂tPi = 0. The steady
state distribution functions satisfy two coupled diﬀerential equations of second
order

xW2 = −η(ω1P1 − ω2P2)

,

(18)

where we have for simplicity assumes that the friction η is the same for both
states. This set of equations together with periodic boundary conditions Pi(x) =
Pi(x + l) deﬁnes the steady state distributions. They can be calculated in special
cases analytically, but in general numerical integration techniques are used. For
each pair (∆µ, fext), there is a uniquely deﬁned average velocity

Similarly, we can introduce the ATP hydrolysis rate r which denotes the number
of chemical cycles performed per unit time [8]. Using the rates introduced in

where

(23)

This condition of detailed balance for the total transition rates indicates that
transitions are just thermal ﬂuctuations and that the system is not driven chemi-
cally. If the external force also vanishes, the steady state is a thermal equilibrium
with Pi = N e−Wi(x)/kB T for which v = 0 and r = 0. For ∆µ > 0, the system
is chemically driven. If no external force is applied spontaneous motion with
v 6= 0 can occur, however only if the system is polar. For a symmetric system
with Wi(x) = Wi(−x) and ωi(x) = ωi(−x) the steady state distributions are
also symmetric Pi(x) = Pi(−x). Since ∂xWi is antisymmetric in this case, v = 0
by symmetry according to Eq. (19). On the other hand, r is in general nonzero
in this case (the functions αi are symmetric). For spontaneous motion to occur
two requirements have to be fulﬁlled: detailed balance of the transition has to be
broken, which corresponds to ∆µ 6= 0 and the system must have polar symmetry.
In the case of motor proteins the polar ﬁlaments play this role.

In the presence of an external force fext, the system can perform mechanical
work, i.e. it operates as a motor. The work performed per unit time against the
external force is

while the chemical energy consumed per unit time is given by

We can therefore deﬁne the eﬃciency of energy transduction

W = −fextv

Q = r∆µ .

η = −

fextv
r∆µ

This quantity is useful for forces applied opposite to the direction of motion
where 0 ≤ η ≤ 1. Note, that this deﬁnition relies on the fact that a bulk solution
exists which plays the role of a thermodynamic reservoir and allows to deﬁne the
chemical potential diﬀerence of fuel and products. In situations where reservoirs
are small the eﬃciency would be more diﬃcult to deﬁne.

For a discussion of physical aspects of motion, it is useful to write

ω1(x) = ω2(x)(Ω(x) + e−∆W/kB T )

,

where

Ω(x) = e−∆W/kB T (e∆µ/kB T − 1)α/(α + β)

For our discussion of the two-state model it is useful to characterize the system
by the functions ω2 and Ω instead of α and β which allows us to discuss motion
generation without the need to introduce chemistry. This choice is more general
and can be used also for cases where transitions between states are triggered
by other processes than chemistry such as in artiﬁcially constructed systems
[31, 32, 33].

The properties of this two-state models have been discussed in Refs. [8, 24,
39, 40]. Calculating the average velocity v as a function of the externally applied
force fext typically leads to a behavior which is well approximated by a linear
dependence

v ≃ v0(1 − (fext/fs))

(31)

for many diﬀerent choices of the potential shapes and the transition rates. Here
v0 is the spontaneous velocity at zero force fext = 0 and fs the stalling force,
i.e. the force for which the system stops moving. Deviations from this linear
behavior mainly occur for forces larger than the stalling force |fext| > |fs| or for
forces parallel to its natural direction of motion fext/fs < 0.

The observed force-velocity curves for kinesin motors show an almost linear
behavior which can be characterized by v0 and fs deﬁned in (31). While fs ≃
5pN does not depend much on experimental conditions, the no-load velocity v0
depends on ATP concentration and attached viscous loads and is of the order of
1µ/s or smaller [17, 41].

The orders of magnitude observed for kinesin can be reproduced by the two-
state model. Using e.g. a choice of potentials as shown in Fig. 6 with transitions
localized at the potential minimum, the stall force is approximatively given by
the potential slope. Choosing a potential amplitude of U ≃ 10kBT which is set
by the available chemical energy of ∆µ ≃ 10 − 15kBT and a period of l ≃ 8nm
of microtubules, this force is fs ≃ U/l = 5pN consistent with the observed
value. The spontaneous velocity of the two-state model can be estimated by
v0 ≃ l/(tc + ts), where tc is the time of the chemical steps and ts ≃ l2η/U
is the sliding time in the potential. Therefore, the observation of v0 does not
ﬁx both the chemical rate and the value of η corresponding to protein friction.
One estimate for the unknown friction η is to assume a hydrodynamic friction
with a viscosity ηvis a factor 102 − 103 larger than the one of water, suggesting
η ∼ ηvisl ∼ (1−10)10−8kg/s. This value takes into account that the dissipation of
proteins should be better represented by the viscous behavior of macromolecular
solutions. A diﬀerent approach is to assume that for large ATP concentration
tc ≃ ω−1
2 Ω−1 is negligible and the friction η determines the sliding velocity
v0 ∼ U/lη. Estimating the maximal velocity to be vmax ∼ 10−5m/s, we ﬁnd

Force and Motion Generation of Molecular Motors: A Generic Description

15

η ∼ 10−7 which can be seen as an upper bound since chemical steps which in
general also contribute to friction are neglected.

A key parameter characterizing the conditions of operation of the two-state
model is the the dimensionless value U/ξl2Ωω2 which compares the typical chem-
ical transition time with sliding times in the potential slope. With the arguments
given above we estimate U/ξl2Ωω2 ≃ 0.1 − 1, where we have used Ωω2 ≃ 103s−1
which is a typical transition rate [42]. However, diﬀerent values are also consis-
tent with the observed force-velocity relation as the spontaneous velocity v0 is
determined by the longest of the two time scales mentioned above. Additional
information such as velocity ﬂuctuations would be required to determine this
value from experimental observations and to ﬁx the orders of magnitude of all
parameters of the model.

The two state model is consistent with the observed behaviors for biologi-
cal motor molecules and reproduces typical velocities and forces and the force
velocity relation. Other types of models which use diﬀerent representations of
states and transitions have also be used to consistently describe the force-velocity
relation of kinesin [38, 43, 44].

4 Collective Eﬀects: Dynamic Instabilities

In many biological situations, motor molecules and ﬁlaments do not operate as
isolated enzymes but many motors are integrated in larger structures. Typical
examples are actin/myosin in muscles and dyneins/microtubules in ﬂagella and
cilia. Furthermore, the presence on motor molecules in the cytoskeleton leads to
complex physical properties of these systems on large scales [45].

The most prominent many-motor system is actin/myosin in muscles. In this
case, myosin molecules are attached together by their tails to form a linear ﬁla-
ment. Myosin ﬁlaments and actin ﬁlaments are arranged in parallel in a highly
organized fashion. In the presence of ATP they slide with respect to each other
which macroscopically leads to muscle contraction. Experimental in vitro “motil-
ity assays” can be used to study myosin function in an artiﬁcial environment. In
these systems, myosin molecules are attached to a solid substrate using speciﬁc
antibodies. Actin ﬁlaments in solution adsorb to the myosin coated surface and
start to move in presence of ATP as a result of the action of myosin motors
[7, 10, 12, 18].

Another example are cilia and ﬂagella which are elastic linear extensions of
many cells which generate a beating motion used to propel the cell within a
solvent or to move the solvent. A ﬂagellum typically contains 9 pairs of mi-
crotubules, each pair coupled by a large number of dynein motors and other
proteins which serve as structural elements. The motors create forces that lead
to the bending and motion of the ﬂagella. Interestingly, these motors are used
to generate oscillating motion [1].

These systems demonstrate that the behavior of systems containing motors
can on larger scales have new and diﬀerent types of behaviors than the one ob-
served for individual motor molecules. As a ﬁrst approach to discuss the behavior

of many motor systems, we generalize the two-state model to describe a large
number of coupled motors [8, 46, 47]. A simple modelization of such a situation is
sketched in Fig. 7 (a). Many motors which all are described by a two-state model
are attached along a linear backbone with constant spacing s. Assuming that
the spacing between motors is ﬁxed implies that the backbone is rigid. Within
this assumption all motors have the same velocity. In practical cases, elastic
properties of the ﬁlaments and of a backbone coupling the motors can become
important. For example in the case of muscles, the passive elastic behavior of
proteins such as titin can play the role of elastically coupling motor-ﬁlament
systems to their environment [1]. Similarly, in ﬂagella, bending elasticity of the
ﬁlaments is essential to allow for the generation of beating motion. Fig. 7 (b)
and (c) sketches two simple ways to incorporate the eﬀects of material elasticity
in the modelization.

4.1 Mean ﬁeld limit

Motors coupled via a rigid backbone allow to illustrate the appearance of collec-
tive eﬀects. For a system of N elements with two states, moving along a periodic
structure, we can introduce the distribution function p(x, σ1, ..., σN ) for ﬁnd-
ing the particles i = 1..N in states σi = 1, 2 with particle i at position x + si
along a linear coordinate. This system thus becomes an eﬀective 2N -state system

is an eﬀective friction coeﬃcient which results from chemical transitions. For a
passive system, this friction must be positive, F (1)
Ω=0 > 0, which is indeed the
case. For Ω 6= 0, however, f (1) can become negative if Ω′∆W ′ is positive. This
criterion implies that the function Ω(ξ) has maxima and minima at the same
positions as ∆W . For W1 periodic and W2 constant this suggests e.g. placing
the maxima of Ω at the positions of minimal W1 which is the idea of localized
excitations.

The fact that F (1)

Ω can become negative suggests the possibility of an insta-
bility in the system. This can be discussed most easily by ﬁrst considering a
symmetric system with symmetric potentials and transition rates. In this case,
the system is invariant under (v, fext) → (−v, −fext), indicating that all even
coeﬃcients f (2n)

Ω = 0 vanish by symmetry. In this case,

becomes negative, see Fig. 8. If no external force is applied, the system does not
move for Ω < Ωc but two moving solutions bifurcate for Ω > Ωc with opposite
velocity while the non-moving solution becomes unstable as revealed by a linear
stability analysis. The system therefore at Ω = Ωc undergoes a bifurcation with
spontaneous symmetry breaking which allows for the existence of spontaneous
motion in the symmetric case.

Fig. 8. Relation between velocity v and externally applied force fext for a symmetric
system. For Ω < Ωc the system is passive. A dynamic transition with spontaneous
symmetry-breaking occurs for Ω = Ωc. For Ω > Ωc, the system is actively moving
with velocity v±. The hysteresis is indicated by a broken line.

If an external force is applied, the system can work against this force until
the instability is reached at the minimum of the force velocity relation. Further
increase of the force leads to a discontinuous change of the velocity. The system
therefore shows the signature of a ﬁrst-order transition with hysteretic behavior
and for fext = 0 bistability where the selection of one of the stable states depends
on the history of the system.

These arguments can be extended to the general case of a system with polar
symmetry. In this case, all coeﬃcients and in particular the spontaneous force
F (0)
Ω are nonzero. Dynamical transitions and instabilities do still exist but now
occur typically for nonzero velocity and in an asymmetric way. A transition oc-
curs if for increasing Ω a point with ηeﬀ = 0 exists for a critical velocity vc
and for a critical force fc. For Ω > Ωc, a ﬁnite region with ηeﬀ = 0 emerges
and the function f (v) has a maximum and a minimum. In this case, discontin-
uous changes of the velocity occur as a function of applied force as soon as the
force reaches the extremal values where the system becomes unstable and the

Force and Motion Generation of Molecular Motors: A Generic Description

transition shows a hysteresis. A behavior with the characteristic as predicted by
this theoretical analysis has been observed in motility assay experiments where
electric ﬁelds are used to exert an external force [18].

4.3 Spontaneous oscillations

Another important consequence of the collectivity is the possibility to generate
oscillatory motion if the system is acting together with elastic elements, see Fig.
7 (c). This corresponds to adding an elastic element to the force balance Eq.
(44), which leads to

where K = kN is the modulus of an external elastic element, k, the modulus
per motor and

is the total displacement of the system. First, we assume that the modulus
k is small. In this case, the force varies slowly and we can use an adiabatic
approximation assuming that at any given time the system is in one of the
steady states with

fext − kx = f (v)

,

where f (v) is the force-velocity relationship introduced in Eq. (47). The change
in velocity can be expressed as

˙v = −

Kv
ηeﬀ (v)

.

η + F (1)

Ω < 0

.

This equation demonstrates that we expect an oscillatory instability to occur in
this adiabatic limit, exactly if

In this case, the non-moving state with v = 0 is unstable. As soon as the system
starts moving an elastic force is created which opposes motion and leads to a de-
crease in velocity according to Eq. (57). As soon as an instability is reached with
ηeﬀ = 0, the velocity changes discontinuously in the opposite direction and the
process is repeated. This scenario leads to characteristic relaxation oscillations
of the position with a sawtooth like shape. For a symmetric system, the forward
and backward parts of this process are identical and oscillations are symmetric
with respect to t → −t. In the asymmetric case, however, the asymmetry of the
system is reﬂected in the shape of the oscillations, see inset of Fig. 9.

This adiabatic approximation is valid as long as the characteristic time ηeﬀ /k
is much longer than the transition times, i.e. ηeﬀ /k ≫ ω−1
2 . For large k and
in particular close to the discontinuous transition with ηeﬀ = 0, the full dynamic

that since k a modulus per motor, a motor collection of N motors can therefore
undergo oscillatory motion if working against an elastic element with rigidity
smaller than K < kmaxN .

The nonlinear relation between force and velocity of steady states can be

equilibrium situation.

Higher order coeﬃcients can be obtained in a systematic way [47]. The ex-
pansion (67) characterizes the history-dependent response of the system to an
external force which is periodic in time for small velocity amplitudes. As a re-
sult of time translation symmetry, the coeﬃcients obey F (n)
m,l1..ln ∼ δm,l1+..+ln.
Spontaneous oscillations are solutions to Eq. (67) with fn = 0 for all n which
are well described near the instability. Far away from the instability nonlinear-
ities become dominant. In the regime of small k, they are well captured by the
adiabatic approximation given by Eq. (57).

5 Discussion and outlook

In the previous sections, we have described a generic framework to model the
force and motion generation of molecular motors. The coupling of a chemical
reaction to internal conformations and spatial degrees of freedom of a motor
enzyme is described by an overdamped stochastic dynamics. Reducing the de-
scription to a simple two state model has the advantage to be suﬃciently simple
for a theoretical analysis but still ﬂexible to allow for a description of conditions
of operation similar to those of motor molecules such as myosin or kinesin.

A quantitative modelization of motor enzymes on the molecular level is diﬃ-
cult. One the one hand experimental data is limited, on the other hand simpliﬁed
models are not designed to describe all details of the functioning of complex en-
zymes. The properties of the two-state model discussed here depend of the choice
of the potential shapes and on the conformation-dependence of the transition
rates described by the functions α(x) and β(x). These functions cannot be de-
duced from the molecular structure and are diﬃcult to obtain experimentally.
This problem is often referred to as the unknown strain-dependence of transi-
tions [37, 43]. The known force-velocity relation for single kinesin molecules is
close to linear [41, 17]. Diﬀerent models which have been used to describe kinesin
motion, all produce almost linear force-velocity relations and describe well the
observed orders of magnitude [26, 38, 43, 44] which demonstrates that the basic
properties of force-generation do not depend much on the details of a chosen
model. For these reasons, we refrain from a full quantitative comparison and
focus our discussion on physical principles.

In biological situations, molecular motors are involved in processes such as
muscle contraction, cell division and ﬂagellar beating which are complex and
involve large numbers of motors together with other enzymes which control and
regulate the function of these systems. A physical approach to more complex
situations is to avoid the complexity of control systems and to investigate the
types of behavior which can result from the activity of many motors alone.
The properties of larger-scale active systems can be studied using concepts of
statistical physics. An important advantage of two-state models in this context is
the possibility to start from a simple model for individual motors and to address

naturally. We therefore predict such behaviors to occur in biological situations.
Related collective phenomena have recently been shown to exist also in other
models [48, 49] which shows that the existence of dynamic instabilities in this
class of systems is quite general. The detailed conditions for which dynamic
transitions will occur in biological systems such as coupled myosins or kinesins
should depend on various parameters such as salt concentrations, temperature,
motor density etc. Our approach does not predict for which situations these new
behaviors can be found but provides a classiﬁcation of the possible self-organized
behaviors of such systems.

In vitro motility assays which use puriﬁed motors and ﬁlaments in an artiﬁcial
environment are ideal systems to test these ideas and to study motor action in the
absence of further biochemical regulatory systems. Motors grafted to a substrate
set ﬂuorescently marked ﬁlaments in motion which can easily be observed by
standard light microscopy. The force-velocity relationship of the actin-myosin
system has recently been determined by constraining ﬁlament motion along one
dimension by using linear grooves of 1µm in diameter as a substrate [18, 50], see
Fig. 3 (d). Electric ﬁelds E applied parallel to the aligned and negatively charged
actin ﬁlaments induce external forces which are homogeneously distributed along
the ﬁlaments. The electrophoretic mobility µ = v/E, where v is the velocity
induced by an electric ﬁeld E, measured for free ﬁlaments can be used to obtain
an estimate for the external force per unit length f ≃ 2πµηw/ ln(r/d)E acting
eﬀectively on the ﬁlament. Here, etaw is the viscosity of the solution and r and
d are the radius of the ﬁlament and the distance between ﬁlament axis and the
substrate. With this argument, we ﬁnd that a ﬁeld of E ≃ 102V/m induces a
force per length of f ≃ 1pN/µm which is the order of magnitude of stall forces
of an actin-myosin system [18].

In addition to providing the ﬁrst force-velocity relations for a puriﬁed actin-
myosin system, these experiments have revealed unexpected behavior for high
myosin densities close to stall conditions. With increasing force applied against
the direction of motion, ﬁlaments slow down, however before stalling completely
an abrupt change in velocity to reverse motion is observed. Since a histogram
of the velocity distribution reveals two distinct maxima for diﬀerent coexist-
ing velocities and discontinuous changes of the velocity occur with a hysteretic
behavior, a natural interpretation of this observation is a dynamic ﬁrst order
transition of the type discussed in the previous sections. However, experiments
of this type are diﬃcult and measured values have signiﬁcant uncertainties; more
data is necessary to clearly prove the existence of the transition. Interestingly,
macroscopic measurements of the behavior of muscles show near stalling con-
ditions an unexpected rapid drop in velocity and a contracting state which is
diﬃcult to stabilize experimentally by feedback systems [51]. This behavior could
result from the averaged mechanical properties of many diﬀerent ﬁlaments which
individually show a transition of the type observed in motility assays.

In recent years, an increasing number of situation have been observed for
which the concepts of dynamic instabilities in many-motor systems could be
relevant. It is well known that the ﬂight muscles of many insects generate os-

26

cillations themselves. These so-called asynchronous muscles show oscillatory be-
havior which is not triggered by a periodic nerve-signal [52]. These systems
are complete muscles for which the role of biochemical control systems could
be important. Recently, it has become possible to study the active mechanical
properties of single myoﬁbrils, i.e. contractile ﬁbers within muscle cells, by using
microneedles. Ordinary muscle myoﬁbrils which under normal conditions simply
contract, show spontaneous oscillations if put in speciﬁc conditions such as in-
creased ADP concentration. Both tension- and length- oscillations were observed
[53]. It was demonstrated that such oscillations continue to exist if regulatory
enzymes bound to the actin-myosin motors were removed [54]. These observa-
tions demonstrate the general possibility of oscillations in many muscles. The
facts that in muscular structures, which couple contractile elements elastically,
oscillations are typically observed while the motility assay which lacks elastic
elements reveals a ﬁrst-order transition is fully consistent with the collective
eﬀects discussed here.

Another important type of oscillating many-motor systems are cilia and
ﬂagella. These are hair-like appendages of many cells which are used for self-
propulsion and to stir the surrounding ﬂuid. They share the characteristic archi-
tecture of their core structure, the axoneme, a common structural motive that
was developed early in evolution. It is characterized by nine parallel pairs of mi-
crotubules which are arranged in a circular fashion together with a large number
of dynein molecular motors. In the presence of ATP, the dyneins attached to the
microtubules generate relative forces while acting on neighboring microtubules.
The resulting internal stresses induce the bending and wave-like motion of the
axoneme [1]. A simple two-dimensional model of ﬁlaments driven internally by
molecular motors can be used to demonstrate that a dynamic instability of the
many-motor system most naturally generates oscillating motion and wave-like
propagating shapes which can be used for self-propulsion [55]. This idea that
simple patterns of motion are induced via a dynamic instability is supported by
the observations that ﬂagellar dyneins are able to generate oscillatory motion
on microtubules [56], and that isolated and de-membranated ﬂagella in solution
containing ATP above a threshold concentration swim with a simple wave-like
motion [57]. This suggests, that basic wave-like patterns of ﬂagellar motion are
generated by a self-organized motor-induced mechanism and that sophisticated
regulatory systems could have evolved at a later time to ﬁne tune the system
and to generate new patterns of motion.

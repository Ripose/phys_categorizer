(February 9, 2008)

The eﬀective interaction between two parallel strands of helical bio-molecules, such as deoxyri-
bose nucleic acids (DNA), is calculated using computer simulations of the “primitive” model of
electrolytes. In particular we study a simple model for B-DNA incorporating explicitly its charge
pattern as a double-helix structure. The eﬀective force and the eﬀective torque exerted onto the
molecules depend on the central distance and on the relative orientation. The contributions of non-
linear screening by monovalent counterions to these forces and torques are analyzed and calculated
for diﬀerent salt concentrations. As a result, we ﬁnd that the sign of the force depends sensitively
on the relative orientation. For intermolecular distances smaller than 6˚A it can be both attractive
and repulsive. Furthermore we report a nonmonotonic behaviour of the eﬀective force for increasing
salt concentration. Both features cannot be described within linear screening theories. For large
distances, on the other hand, the results agree with linear screening theories provided the charge of
the bio-molecules is suitably renormalized.

I. INTRODUCTION

Aqueous solutions of helical bio-molecules like deoxyri-
bose nucleic acids (DNA) are typically highly charged
such that electrostatic interactions play an important
role in many aspects of their structure and function
[1–6]. Understanding the total eﬀective interaction be-
tween two helical molecules is important since this gov-
erns the self-assembly of bio-molecules, like bundle for-
mation and DNA condensation or compaction which in
turn is fundamental for gene delivery and gene therapy.
In aqueous solution, such rod-like polyelectrolytes release
counterions in the solution which ensure global charge
neutrality of the system. Together with these counteri-
ons, there are, in general, added salt ions dissolved in the
solution. The thermal ions screen the bare electrostatic
interactions between the bio-molecules, such that the ef-
fective interaction between them is expected to become
weaker than the direct Coulomb repulsion. For very high
concentrations of bio-molecules or short distances even
a mutual attraction due to counterion ”overscreening” is
conceivable [7–24].

In this paper, we study the eﬀective interaction be-
In particular,
tween two parallel helical bio-molecules.
we investigate how the electrostatic interactions are in-
ﬂuenced by details of the charge pattern on the biological
macromolecules. In fact, in many cases, as e.g. for DNA
molecules, the charge pattern on the molecules is not
uniform but exhibits an intrinsic helix structure. If two
parallel helical molecules are nearby, this helix structure
will induce an interaction that depends on the relative
orientation of the two helices. Our studies are based on
computer simulation of the “primitive” model of elec-
trolytes [25]. In particular we study a simple model for
B-DNA. This model explicitly takes into account the

double-helical charge pattern along the DNA-strand, it
also accounts for the molecular shape by modeling the
major and minor grooves along the strand. The charged
counter- and salt ions in the solutions are explicitly in-
corporated into our model. On the other hand, the wa-
ter molecules only constitute a continuous background
with a dielectric constant ǫ screening the Coulomb in-
teractions. Hence the discrete nature of the solvent is
neglected as well as more subtle eﬀects as image charges
induced by dielectric discontinuities at the DNA-water
boundary [26–29], hydration eﬀects due to the aﬀection
of the hydrophilic surface to the interfacial layers of wa-
ter [30–35], and spatial dependent dielectric constants
resulting from the decreasing water mobility in conﬁning
geometries and from saturation eﬀects induced by water
polarization near the highly charged molecular surfaces
[36–41].

Our motivation to consider such a simple ”primitive”
model is threefold: First, though solvent eﬀects seem to
be relevant they should average out on a length scale
which is larger than the range of the microscopic sizes.
Hence the electrostatic eﬀects are expected to dominate
the total eﬀective interactions. Second, it is justiﬁed to
study a simple model completely and then adapt it by
introducing more degrees of freedom in order to better
match the experimental situation. Our philosophy is in-
deed to understand the principles of a simple model ﬁrst
and then turn step by step to more complicated models.
Third, even within the “primitive” approach, there are
many unsolved problems and unexpected eﬀects such as
mutual attraction of equally charged particles. Our com-
puter simulation method has the advantage that “exact”
results are obtained that reﬂect directly the nature of
the model. Hence we get rid of any approximation in-
herent in a theoretical description. Consequently, the

dependence of the eﬀective interactions on a model pa-
rameter can systematically be studied and the trends can
be compared to experiments. In this respect our model is
superior to previous studies that describe the counterion
screening by linear Debye-H¨uckel [39,42,4,43] or nonlin-
ear Poisson-Boltzmann theory [26,4,44–51] and even to
recent approaches that include approximatively counte-
rion correlations [52,53]. We also emphasize that one
main goal of the paper is to incorporate the molecular
shape and charge pattern explicitly which is modelled in
many studies simply as a homogeneously charged cylin-
In fact we ﬁnd that the double-helix
der [39,4,54,55].
structure has an important inﬂuence on the eﬀective in-
teraction for surface-to-surface separations smaller than
6˚A. In detail, the interaction can be both repulsive and
attractive depending on the relative orientation and the
mutual distance between two parallel DNA strands. This
eﬀect which is typically ignored in the charged-cylinder
model for DNA will signiﬁcantly aﬀect the self-assembly
of parallel smectic layers of DNA fragments and may re-
sult in unusual crystalline structures at high concentra-
tions.

Let us also mention that many theoretical studies in-
volve only a single DNA molecule [56–59,3]. To extract
the eﬀective interaction, however, one has at least to in-
clude two molecules in the model which is the purpose of
the present paper. In this study we only consider mono-
valent counterions. Multivalent counterions and a more
detailed survey on the inﬂuence of model parameters on
the eﬀective interactions will be considered in a subse-
quent publication.

The remainder of paper is organized as follows.
In
chapter II, we present the details of the model used in this
paper. Chapter III describes the target quantities of the
applied model. Simulation details are presented in chap-
ter IV. Theories based on linear screening approaches
such as the homogeneously charged cylinder model, the
Yukawa segment model and the Kornyshev-Leikin theory
[60] are shortly discussed in chapter V. Results of the sim-
ulation and their comparison to linear screening theories
are contained in sections VI-VIII for the point-charge
model, the grooved model and added salt respectively.
We conclude in section IX.

II. THE MODEL

The charge pattern and the shape of a single B-DNA
molecule is basically governed by the phosphate groups
which exhibit a double helix structure with right-hand
helicity. We model this by an inﬁnitely long neutral hard
cylinder oriented in z direction with additional charged
hard spheres whose centers are located on top of the
cylindrical surface. Each charged sphere describes a
phosphate group and hence the spheres form a double
helix structure. In detail, the eﬀective cylindrical diam-
eter D is commonly chosen to be D = 20˚A [61,62,49].

−

The spheres are monovalent, i.e. their charge qp < 0
corresponds to one elementary charge e > 0, qp =
e,
and they have an eﬀective diameter dp. We do not ﬁx
dp but keep it as an additional (formal) parameter in
the range between dp = 0.2˚A (practically the point-like
charge limit) to dp = 6˚A (to incorporate a groove ge-
ometry for the molecule). Furthermore, the helical pitch
length is P = 34˚A; the number of charged spheres per
pitch length (or per helical turn) is 10. Consequently,
successive charges on the same strand are displaced by
an azimuthal angle of 36◦ corresponding to a charge spac-
ing of 3.4˚A in z direction. In a plane perpendicular to the
z direction, phosphate groups of the two diﬀerent helices
are separated by an azimuthal angle of φs = 144◦, see
Figure 1, ﬁxing the minor and the major helical groove
along the DNA molecule.

We place the discrete charges on the two diﬀerent he-
lices such that two of them fall in a common plane per-
pendicular to the z axis, see again Figure 1. The to-
tal line charge density along the DNA molecule is then
λ =

0.59e/˚A.

The second DNA molecule is considered to be paral-
lel to the ﬁrst one in our studies. The separation be-
tween the two cylinder origins is R, we also introduce the
surface-to-surface separation h = R
D. The position
of the two double helices can be described by a relative
angle diﬀerence φ between the two azimuthal angles de-
scribing the position of the bottom helix with respect to a
ﬁxed axis in the xy plane. This is illustrated in Figure 1.
The relative orientation φ is the key quantity in describ-

ing the angle dependence of the forces induced by the
helical structure. We remark that we only study a situ-
ation where the discrete phosphates from diﬀerent DNA
strands possess the same z coordinates for φ = 0. Small
shifts in the z coordinate are not expected to change the
results signiﬁcantly. A further parameter characterizing
the discrete location of the phosphate charges along the
strands is the azimuthal angle φ0 of a phosphate charge
with respect to the cylinder separation vector, see again
Figure 1. All results are periodic in φ0 with a periodicity
of 36◦.

In addition to the DNA molecules we describe the
counterions by charged hard spheres of diameter dc and
charge qc. The counterions are held at room temper-
ature T = 298K. Their concentration is ﬁxed by the
charge of the DNA molecules due to the constraint of
global charge neutrality. Also, additional salt ions with
charges q+ and q−, modelled as charged hard spheres of
diameters d+ and d−, are incorporated into our model.
The salt concentration is denoted by Cs. The discrete
nature of the solvent, however, is neglected completely.

The interactions between the mobile ions and phos-
phate charges are described within the framework of the
primitive model as a combination of excluded volume and
Coulomb interactions screened by the dielectric constant
ǫ of the solvent. The corresponding pair interaction po-
tential between the diﬀerent charged hard spheres is

where r is the interparticle separation and i, j are indices
denoting the diﬀerent particles species. Possible values
for i and j are c (for counterions), +,
(for positively
and negatively charged salt ions), and p (for phosphate
groups).
In addition, there is an interaction potential
V 0
i between the DNA hard cylinder and the free ions
which is of simple excluded volume form such
i = c, +,
that these ions cannot penetrate into the cylinder.

Due to the length of this paper and the large number of
quantities, we summarize most of our notation in Table I.

III. TARGET QUANTITIES

Our target quantities are equilibrium statistical av-
erages for the local counter- and salt ion densities and
the eﬀective forces and torques exerted onto the bio-
molecules. For that purpose we consider a slightly more
general situation with N parallel DNA molecules con-
tained in a system of volume V . The cylinder centers are
ﬁxed at positions ~Ri (i = 1, ..., N ) in the xy-plane. We
further assume that there are Nc counterions and N+, N−
salt ions in the same system. By this we obtain partial
concentrations nc = Nc/V, n+ = N+/V, n− = N−/V of
counter and salt ions.

First we deﬁne the equilibrium number density proﬁles

IV. COMPUTER SIMULATION

Our computer simulation was performed within a sim-
ple set-up which is schematically shown in Figure 2. We
consider two parallel DNA molecules in a cubic box of
length L with periodic boundary conditions in all three
directions. L is chosen to be three times the pitch length
P such that there are Np = 120 phosphate charges in the
box. The number of counterions Nc = 120 in the box
is ﬁxed by charged neutrality while the number of salt
ions, Ns, is governed by its concentration Cs. The sep-
aration vector between the centers of the two molecules
points along the x-direction of the simulation box. The
relative orientation is described according to our notation
presented in chapter II, see again Figure 1.

p

We performed a standard Molecular Dynamic (MD)
code with velocity Verlet algorithm [67]. System param-
eters used in our simulations are listed in Table II. The
t of the simulation was typically chosen to be
time step

m/e2, with m denoting the (ﬁctitious) mass
m d3
of the mobile ions, such that the reﬂection of counteri-
ons following the collision with the surface of DNA core
cylinder and phosphates is calculated with high precision.
For every run the state of the system was checked during
the simulation time. This was done by monitoring the
temperature, average velocity, the distribution function
of velocities and total potential energy of the system. On
average it took about 104 MD steps to get into equilib-

The long-ranged nature of the Coulomb interaction
was numerically treated via the eﬃcient method pro-
posed by Lekner [68]. A summary of this method is
given in Appendix A. In order to save CPU time, the
Lekner forces between pair particles were tabulated in
a separate code before entering into the main MD cycle.
The tabulation on a 510
510 grid with spatial step
510
=0.1˚A was done in the following manner. The ﬁrst parti-
cle was ﬁxed at the origin (0,0,0) while the second charge
was successively embedded on sites of the generated grid.
Then the force components acting onto the ﬁrst charge
were calculated via the Lekner method. A force data
ﬁle was created which was used as a common input for
all subsequent MD runs. To decrease error coming from
a ﬁnite grid length, the forces in the simulations were
calculated using the four-step focusing technique [69].

V. LINEAR SCREENING THEORY

Linear screening theory can be used to get explicit an-
alytical expressions for the eﬀective interactions between
helical bio-molecules. These kind of theories, however,
should only work for weak Coulomb coupling and thus
represent a further approximation to the primitive model.
Depending on the form of the ﬁxed charge pattern char-
acterizing the biomolecules, one obtains diﬀerent approx-
imations.

A. Homogeneously charged cylinder

The simplest approach is to crudely describe the
biomolecule as a homogeneously charged cylinder. In this
case, the eﬀective interaction force per pitch length be-
tween two parallel rods reads [25]

in the sequel.

C. Kornyshev-Leikin theory

The linear Debye-H¨uckel screening theory was recently

lel rods of separation R with relative orientation φ was
given for separations larger than R > D + λD. Here we

We emphasize that the KL-theory does not assume a
priori the double helical phosphate charge pattern as de-
ﬁned in chapter II. There are rather more possible charge
patterns considered including a condensation of counteri-
ons in the minor and major groove along the phosphate
strands, and on the cylinder as a whole. This involves
four phenomenological parameters as a further input for
the KL theory which makes a direct comparison to the
simulation data diﬃcult. In fact, for the charge pattern
given in chapter II, the KL-theory reduces to the Yukawa-
segment model.

In detail, the charge pattern is characterized by the

Here δn,m is the Kronecker’s delta function; θ is the ﬁrst
phenomenological input parameter which describes the
fraction of counterions that are condensed on the whole
cylinder. The three numbers fi denote the fractions of
counterions in the middle of the minor groove (f1), in the
middle of the major groove (f2), and on the phosphate
strands (f3) with respect to all condensed counterions.
We note that the sum in (20) rapidly converges, such
that it can safely be truncated for
> 2. It is straight-
forward to obtain the eﬀective force and torque per pitch
length between two molecules from (20) by taking gradi-
ents with respect to R and φ.

F = ~F1 ·

of F implies attraction, and a positive sign repulsion.

we assume the counterion and phosphate diameters to be

A. Distribution of the counterions around the DNA
molecules

We calculated the equilibrium density ﬁeld (2) of the
counterions in the vicinity of the DNA molecules by com-
puter simulation. In detail, we considered three diﬀerent
paths to show the counterion density proﬁle around the

ﬁrst DNA molecule: along a phosphate strand and along
the minor and major groove. In order to reduce the sta-
tistical error we course-grained this density ﬁeld further
in a ﬁnite volume which is illustrated in Figure 3.

FIG. 3. A schematic picture to explain the procedure of
counterion density calculations along one pitch length of a
DNA molecule. The ﬁlled circles connected with solid line
are phosphate groups. The shaded areas correspond to a path
along the major groove and along one phosphate strand. The
considered volume has a height ξ and width δ. The neigh-
bouring DNA molecule is assumed to be on the right hand
side.

This volume is winding around the molecules with a
height ξ and width δ. We choose ξ = 3.4˚A and δ =
2˚A+dc/2. In Figure 4 we plot this coarse-grained density
ﬁeld ρc(ϕ) versus the azimuthal angle angle ϕ from 0◦ to
360◦ where ϕ is 0◦ resp. 360◦ in the inner region between
the DNA molecules.

Obviously, the counterion density proﬁle has maxima
in the neighbourhood of the ﬁxed phosphate charges.
Furthermore the concentration of counterions is higher
in the minor than in the major grooves with the ϕ-
dependence reﬂecting again the position of the phosphate
charges. Also in the inner region between the two DNA
molecules, there are on average more counterions than in
the outside region.

B. Nearly touching conﬁgurations

Let us now consider very small surface-to-surface sep-
arations between the DNA molecules. In this case one
expects that the dependence of the forces and torques
on the relative orientation φ is most pronounced. For
such nearly touching conﬁgurations, however, the dis-
creteness of the phosphate charges, as embodied in the
parameter φ0, strongly inﬂuences the results as well. The
qualitative behaviour of the φ dependence can be under-
stood from Figure 5. Here two touching DNA molecules
are shown for diﬀerent relative orientations φ where the
phosphate strands are schematically drawn as continuous
lines. For certain angles φ which we call touching angles,
two neighbouring phosphate charges hit each other. Pos-
sible touching angles are φ = 36◦, 180◦, 324◦.
If φ0 is
chosen to be zero, then two point charges are opposing
eachother directly. Hence a strong dependence on φ and
on φ0 is expected near touching angles.

Results from computer simulation and YS-theory are
presented in Figure 6. The parameters are from run A
(see Table II) but with dc = 0.8˚A. The surface-to-surface
separation is h = 2˚A.

For touching angles, the interaction force becomes
strongly repulsive. The strongest repulsion is achieved
for φ = 180◦ since two phosphate strands are meeting
simultaneously. For relative orientations diﬀerent from
a touching angle, the force becomes smaller and can be
both, attractive and repulsive. YS-theory always predicts
a repulsive force. Again there are strong peaks for touch-
ing angles in qualitative agreement with the simulation.
The actual numbers predicted by YS-theory, however, are
much too large and oﬀ by a factor of 6-7 around touching
angles.

The torque shows an even richer structure as a func-
tion of φ. Near a touching angle it exhibits three zeroes
corresponding to an unstable minimum exactly at the
touching angle and two stable minima near the touching
angles. The YS-theory shows 2 times larger values for
the torque as compared to the simulation data.

A qualitatively diﬀerent force-angle behavior is ob-
served for a larger counterion diameter. Results for
dc = 1˚A are shown in Figure 7.

Here at touching angles, the interaction force is attrac-
tive. The physical reason for that are the contact forces
as given by Eqn.(8). Caused by the larger counterion
diameter, counterions are stronger depleted in the zone
between the DNA molecules. The torque has qualita-
tively the same behaviour as before.

We emphasize that the results do also depend strongly
on φ0. For φ0 = 18◦, for instance, the force F practically

8

vanishes for any relative orientation φ as compared to the
same data for φ0 = 0◦.

C. Distance-resolved forces

We now discuss in more detail the distance-resolved
eﬀective forces. For the parameters of run A, simulation
results for F are presented in Figure 8.

≈

For φ0 = 0, the force depends on the relative orien-
6˚A
tation φ up to a surface-to-surface separation h
in accordance with Figure 7. On the other hand, for
φ0 = 18◦, there is no φ dependence at all for any sepa-
ration. This supports the conclusion of previous works
[57,55], that the eﬀect of discreteness of the DNA phos-
phate charges on the counterion concentration proﬁle is
small in general and dwindles a few Angstroms from the
DNA surface. In fact, for h > 6˚A, there is neither a φ
nor a φ0 dependence of the force, and the total force is
repulsive.

Furthermore we compare our simulation results with
the prediction of linear screening theories in Figure 9.
First of all, our simulation data for the total force (solid
circles) are decomposed into the electrostatic part

pulsive, the electrostatic part is attractive such that the
net force is repulsive. Linear screening theories aim to
describe the pure electrostatic force only.

Results for linear screening theories on diﬀerent lev-
els are also collected in Figure 9. If one compares with
the total force, the prediction obtained by a homoge-
neously charged cylinder is repulsive and oﬀ by a factor of
roughly 1.5. A simulation with a homogeneously charged
rod yields perfect agreement with linear screening theory
since the Coulomb coupling is strongly reduced as the rod
charges are now in the inner part of the cylinder. The
Yukawa-segment theory is repulsive and oﬀ by a factor
of 3.
It is understandable that the YS model leads to
a stronger repulsion than the charged cylinder model as
the separation of the phosphate charges in the inner re-
gion between the DNA molecules is shorter than the rod
center separation.

the fraction of counterions which are condensed onto the
DNA within this shell. The actual value for δ is some-
what arbitrary, we ﬁrst took a microscopic shell of width
δ = 2.5˚A as well as δ = λB = 7.1˚A. Data for θ versus the
rod separation are included in Figure 10 for three diﬀer-
ent combinations of counterion and phosphate diameters.
It becomes evident that the fraction θ of condensed coun-
terions decreases with the rod distance but saturates at
large separations. θ also depends on the size of the coun-
terions and phosphate charges. If the width of the shell
δ is enhanced towards δ = λB = 7.1˚A, θ increases again.
On the other hand, θ is independent of the relative orien-
tation φ. The actual data are consistent with Manning’s
condensation parameter [82,83] θ0 = λ/
λB = 0.71
particularly if the width δ is taken as one Bjerrum length.
Our data are also in semiquantitative accordance with
other computer simulations [38] and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) experiments which show that the con-
densed counterion fractions are in the range of 0.65 to
0.85 [84] or 0.53 to 0.57 [85,45].

The Kornyshev-Leikin theory requires four counterion
condensation fractions θ, f1, f2, f3 as an input. We
have tried to determine these parameters from our sim-
ulation in order to get a direct comparison without any
ﬁtting procedure. In order to do so, we introduce a small
shell around the cylinder of width δ and determine θ as

at θ = 0.71 indicates the saturation value at large distances
for a larger δ = lB = 7.1˚A. This saturation value is the same
for run A,B, and C.

According to our results for the counterion density
distribution (see Figure 4) we ﬁx the minor and major
groove fractions to f1 = 0.1, f2 = 0.1, and the strand

fraction to f3 = 0.7. Thus, (1

fraction of the condensed counterions which is distributed
neither on the phosphates strands nor on the minor and
major grooves. The force in KL theory depends sensi-
tively on θ but is rather insensitive with respect to f1,
f2, f3, and φ. If the Bjerrum length is taken as a width
for the condensed counterions, θ = 0.71, then the KL the-
ory underestimates the total force. If, on the other hand,
a reduced value of θ = 0.545 is heuristically assumed,
then the KL theory reproduces the total force quite well.
A serious problem of the comparison with linear screen-
ing theories is that the contact term is not incorporated
in any theory apart from recent modiﬁcations [86,64]. In
fact, one should better compare the pure electrostatic
part which is attractive in the simulation. Consequently,
none of the linear screening theories is capable to describe
the force well. This is due to the neglection of correla-
tions and ﬂuctuations in linear screening theories. From
a more pragmatic point of view, however, one may state
that a suitable charge renormalization leads to quanti-
tative agreement with the total force. In fact, all three
theories yield perfect agreement if the phosphate charges
resp. the condensation parameter θ is taken as a ﬁt pa-
rameter. For instance, the YS-model yields perfect agree-
ment with the simulation for distances larger than 26˚A if
in Eqn.(16) a renormalized phosphate charge q∗
0.6e
is taken replacing the bare charge qp. But this is still
unsatisfactory from a more principal point a view.

VII. RESULTS FOR THE GROOVED MODEL

The groove structure of DNA is expected to be of in-
creasing signiﬁcance as one approaches its surface [87].
We incorporate this in our model by increasing the phos-
phate diameter towards dp = 2˚A (run B) and dp = 6˚A
(run C). Results for the condensation parameter θ are
shown in Figure 10. θ is decreasing with increasing dp
since the coupling parameter Γpc is decreasing which
weakens counterion binding to the phosphate groups.
Also the qualitative shape of the counterion density pro-
ﬁles depends sensitively on the groove nature as can be
deduced from Figure 11 as compared to Figure 4. The
counterion density along the phosphate strands now ex-
hibits minima at the phosphate charge positions while it
was maximal there in Figure 4. Furthermore, the coun-
terion density in the minor grooves is now higher than
along the strands due to the geometrical constraints for
the counterion positions which is similar to results of Ref.
[55]. In fact, recent X-ray diﬀraction [88–90] and NMR
spectroscopy [91,92] experiments, as well as molecular
mechanics [93,94] and Monte Carlo simulations [5] sug-
gest that monovalent cations selectively partition into the
minor groove. This eﬀect is present also in our simple
model and can thus already be understood from electro-
statics and thermostatics.

An increasing phosphate and counterion size increases
the eﬀective forces which is shown in Figure 12. Here, as
φ0 was chosen to be 18◦, there is no notable dependence
on the relative orientation φ. A similar behavior was ob-
served in a hexagonally ordered DNA system via Monte
Carlo calculations [24]. This is understandable as coun-
terion screening is becoming less eﬀective. We have tried
to ﬁt the simulation data using a renormalized charge in
the YS theory. A good ﬁt was obtained for large sepa-
rations while there are increasing deviations at shorter
distances. This is diﬀerent from our results for small ion
sizes also shown in Figure 12 where the ﬁt was valid over
the whole range of separations. The adjustable parame-
ter q∗
p is shown versus the eﬀective phosphate radius r∗
p
of the YS model in the inset of Figure 12. It is increasing
with increasing r∗
p in qualitative agreement with charge
renormalization models [95].

We also note that the physical nature of the electro-
static part of the interaction force undergoes a trans-
formation upon decreasing the coupling parameter Γpc.
For strong coupling, Γpc = 12 (run A), the electrostatic
part F (1) + F (2) is attractive (see Figure 9). For mod-
erate coupling, Γpc = 3.6 (run B), it is nearly zero for
all distances. Finally, for weak coupling,Γpc = 1.8 (run
C) the electrostatic part is elsewhere repulsive. The en-
tropic part F (3) for these three runs is always repulsive
and does not undergo a signiﬁcant change.

VIII. RESULTS FOR ADDED SALT

Interactions involving nucleic acids are strongly depen-
dent on salt concentration. Indeed, the strength of bind-
ing constants can change by orders of magnitude with
only small changes in ionic strength [96,97]. Our simula-
tions show a similar strong salt impact on the interaction
force.

When salt ions are added, there is a competition be-
tween two eﬀects. The ﬁrst one is the increasing of the
direct repulsion between molecules as a consequence of
delocalizing the adsorbed counterions. The second stems
from the osmotic pressure of added salt that pushes the
salt ions to occupy the inner molecular region and to
screen the DNA-DNA repulsion. As we shall show be-
low, these two eﬀects result in a novel non-monotonic
behaviour of the force as a function of salt concentra-
tion.

Simulation results for F versus distance for increas-
ing salt concentration are presented in Figure 13. In our
simulations, counter and equally charged salt ions are in-
distinguishable. We take d+ = d− = dc,
= e.
It can be concluded from Figure 13 that even a small
amount of salt ions (line 1, run D, Cs = 0.025M ) signiﬁ-
cantly enhances the DNA-DNA repulsion (compare with
the dashed line corresponding to run A, Cs = 0M ). Upon
increasing the salt concentration, at large separations,
h > 10˚A, the screening is increased in accordance with
the linear theory. However, at intermediate and nearly
touching separations, a non-monotonic behaviour as a
function of salt concentration is observed as illustrated in
the inset of Figure 13. In the inset, the maximum of F oc-
curs for Cs = 0.2M . The physical reason for that is that
added salt ions ﬁrst delocalize bound counterions which
leads to a stronger repulsion. Upon further increasing
the salt concentration, the electrostatic screening is en-
hanced again and the force gets less repulsive. In order
to support this picture we show typical microion conﬁg-
urations and investigate also the fraction θ of condensed
counterions as a function of salt concentration.

Simulation snapshots are given in Figure 14, where the
positions of the mobile ions are projected onto the xy-
plane.

A comparison of the salt-free case (Figure 14a) with
that of moderate salt concentration (Cs = 0.2M , Fig-
ure 14b) reveals that the total number of adsorbed coun-
terions decreases with increasing Cs. Furthermore, for
Cs = 0.2M (Figure 14b), there are no coions in the inner
DNA-DNA region. Thus salt ions do not participate in
screening. Consequently, the DNA-DNA interaction, due
to delocalization of counterions, will be enhanced. Con-
trary to that, for Cs = 0.73M , (Figure 14c) the salt co-
and counterions enter into the inner DNA-DNA region
and eﬀectively screen the interaction force.

Further information is gained from the fraction θ of
condensed counterions which is plotted as a function of R
for diﬀerent salt concentrations Cs in Figure 15. We de-
ﬁne θ as the ratio of condensed counterions coming from
the molecules with respect to the total number of counte-
rions stemming from the molecules. As Cs increases, the
saturation of θ occurs at smaller distances. In the inset of
Figure 15 a non-monotonic behaviour of θ as a function
of the added salt concentration is visible which again is
a clear signature of the scenario discussed above. The
increase of θ above a certain threshold of salt concentra-
tion is mainly due to a counterion accumulation outside
the grooves. A similar trend was predicted by Poisson-
Boltzmann [98] and Monte Carlo [61,47] calculations in
diﬀerent models.

FIG. 15. Same as Figure 10, but now with added salt. Sym-
bols: △ - run A, • - run D, ◦ - run E, ⋄ - run F, ∗ - run G, ×
- run H. The inset shows θ for ﬁxed distance as a function of
salt concentration: solid line- for R = 26˚A; dashed line- for
R = 30˚A.

More details of the forces and the comparison to linear
screening theories are shown in Figures 16, 17 and 18.
For run F, the diﬀerent parts of the total force are pre-
sented in Figure 16. As compared to the salt-free case
(Figure 9) the pure electrostatic part is again attractive
but much smaller, while the depletion part is repulsive
and dominates the total force. All three linear models,
homogeneously charged cylinder model, YS, and KL the-
ory, underestimate the force. Note that the KL-theory
with a θ parameter corresponding to a width δ of one
Bjerrum length and the homogeneously charged cylinder
model give the same results. Again with a suitable scal-
ing of the prefactor by introducing a renormalized phos-
phate charge q∗
p resp. by ﬁtting the condensed fraction θ,
one can achieve good agreement with the simulation data
for distances larger than 24˚A. The ﬁtting parameter q∗
p
used for the YS-model is
1.1e, while the optimal con-
−
densed fraction θ for the KL-theory is 0.2. The optimal
renormalized phosphate charge q∗
p is shown versus salt
concentration in Figure 17. Note that the usual DLVO
size correction factor ζ is already incorporated in the in-
teraction, so what one sees are actual deviations from
DLVO theory. The renormalized charge q∗
p increases with
increasing Cs which is consistent with the works of Del-
row et al [73] and Stigter [27]. If one simulates the force
within the homogeneously charged rod model, one ﬁnds
good agreement with our simulation data for large sepa-

FIG. 16. Same as Figure 9 but now for run F and
φ = 0◦, φ0 = 18◦. The KL theory was adjusted to
f1 = 0.1, f2 = 0.1, f3 = 0.7, θ = 0.71. The results for KL
theory and homogeneously charged cylinder models coincide
exactly.

We also note that our simulations give no notable de-
pendence of the force on the relative orientation φ for
h > 6˚A. Only for small separations, h < 6˚A there is a
slight dependence in agreement with Ref. [57].

Finally we show the inﬂuence of the ion and phosphate
size on the eﬀective force (for the parameters of run I)
in Figure 18. The electrostatic part of the force is now
repulsive but the total force is still dominated by the de-
pletion part. As far as the comparison to linear screening
theories is concerned, one may draw similar conclusions
as for Figure 16. The ﬁtting parameter q∗
p needed to de-
scribe the long-distance behaviour within the YS model
does not depend sensitively on the phosphate and ion
sizes. With a suitable scaling of the prefactor one can
achieve good agreement with the simulation data for dis-
tance larger than 26˚A. The ﬁtting parameter q∗
p used
1.1e, while the optimal condensed
for the YS-model is
fraction θ for the KL-theory is 0.19. Here again, simu-
lations of the homogeneously charged cylinder model are
in good agreement with our results obtained for a double
stranded DNA molecule.

IX. COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have calculated the interaction be-
tween two parallel B-DNA molecules within a “primi-
tive” model. In particular, we focussed on the distance-
and orientation-resolved eﬀective forces and torques as a
function of salt concentration. Our main conclusions are
as follows:

FIG. 18. Same as Figure 9 but now for run I and

. The KL theory was adjusted to
f1 = 0.1, f2 = 0.1, f3 = 0.7, θ = 0.71. Note that the KL and
homogeneously charged cylinder models produce the same
curves.

First, the interaction force for larger separations is re-
pulsive and dominated by microion depletion. The ori-
entational dependence induced by the internal helical
charge pattern is short ranged decaying within a typi-
cal surface-to-surface separation of 6˚A. For shorter sep-
arations there is a signiﬁcant dependence on the rela-
tive orientation φ and on the discreteness of the charge
distribution along the strands. As a function of φ, the
force can be both attractive and repulsive. This may
lead to unusual phase behaviour in smectic layers of par-
allel DNA molecules. Details of the molecular shape and
counterion size are important for small separations as
well. The torque is relatively small except for small sep-
arations where it exhibits a complicated φ-dependence.

Second, as a function of added salt concentration we
predict a non-monotonic behaviour of the force induced
by a competition between delocalization of condensed
counterions and enhanced electrostatic screening. This
eﬀect can in principle be veriﬁed in experiments.

Third, linear screening theories describe the simula-
tion data qualitatively but not quantitatively. Having
in mind that the total force is dominated by the deple-
tion term which is typically neglected in linear screen-
ing theory, such theories need improvement. On the
other hand, the diﬀerent theories predict the correct long-
distance behaviour, if a phenomenological ﬁt parameter -
as the renormalized phosphate charge q∗
p for the Yukawa-
segment model or the condensation fraction θ for the
Kornyshev-Leikin model - is introduced. The Yukawa-
segment model can even predict the orientational depen-
dence of the force and the torque at smaller distances in
the case of small counterion and phosphate sizes. Hence,
a phenomenological Yukawa segment model can be used
in a statistical description of the phase behaviour of many
parallel DNA strands in a smectic layer.

Future work should focus on an analysis for divalent
counterions which are expected to lead to a qualitatively
diﬀerent behaviour since the Coulomb coupling is en-
hanced strongly in this case. Also, one should step by
step increase the complexity of the model in order to
take eﬀects such as dielectric discontinuities [38,41,27,99],
chemical bindings of counterions in the grooves and dis-
crete polarizable solvents into account.

APPENDIX A: LEKNER SUMMATION METHOD FOR FORCES

In our simulations we account for the long-range nature of the Coulomb interactions via the eﬃcient method proposed
by Lekner [68]. This method has been successfully applied to partially periodic systems [14,100]. For an assembly of
N ions in a central cubic cell of dimension L, the Coulomb force ~F (c)
exerted onto particle i by particle j, and by all
repetitions of particle j in the periodic system, is

i

Because of x, y, z symmetry it is suﬃcient to consider only one component of the force. For the x-component of the
force we have

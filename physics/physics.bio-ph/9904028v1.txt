Abstract. The quasispecies theory is studied for dynamic replication
landscapes. A meaningful asymptotic quasispecies is deﬁned for periodic
time dependencies. The quasispecies’ composition is constantly changing
over the oscillation period. The error threshold moves towards the posi-
tion of the time averaged landscape for high oscillation frequencies and
follows the landscape closely for low oscillation frequencies.

1 Introduction

The quasispecies theory, put forward by Eigen in 1971 [1], and subsequently stud-
ied by Eigen, Schuster, McCaskill and coworkers [2, 3, 4], is nowadays one of the
classical theories of self-replicating entities. Its prediction of an error threshold
above which the self-replication ceases to produce useful oﬀspring has impor-
tant implications for the origin of life. The error threshold eﬀectively limits the
amount of information the entities can carry, thus placing an upper bound on
the complexity self-reproducing information carriers can achieve without sophis-
ticated error correction mechanisms.

Although completely static environments are unrealistic in any case apart
from experiments in perfectly controlled ﬂow reactors, the quasispecies theory
has so far been considered only in static replication landscapes. Nevertheless,
even under ﬁxed environmental conditions can the replication rates of RNA
molecules, for example, change because of changing concentrations of template
and replica [5]. One of the reasons for the neglect of changing replication coef-
ﬁcients is probably the fact that for arbitrary temporal changes an asymptotic
quasispecies cannot be deﬁned. However, a meaningful deﬁnition is at hand for
time-periodic replication landscapes, as we are going to show below.

2 Periodic replication landscapes

We start from the discretized form of Eigen’s evolution equation [6], linearized
with the appropriate transformation [7, 8]. Due to space limitations, we cannot
repeat the arguments leading to that equation here. For details about this calcu-
lation, and also about the meaning of the symbols, the reader is referred to [4].

We mainly use the same notations as are used there. Additionally, we deﬁne the
error rate R = 1 − q, which gives the probability that a single symbol is copied
erroneously. The string length will be denoted by l throughout this paper.

The vector of the unnormalized sequence concentrations y(t) evolves accord-

ing to

y(t + ∆t) =

∆t W(t) + 1

y(t).

(1)

Here, W(t) is the replication matrix W(t) = QA(t) − D(t), the symbol 1 stands
for the identity matrix, and ∆t is the length of a time step. We assume the
matrix W(t) is periodic in t with period T = n∆t, n ∈ N.

After iterating Eq. (1) n times, we obtain

It is useful to introduce a time ordering operator T {·}. The operator T {·} acts in
such a way that matrices evaluated at later times are sorted to the left of matrices
evaluated at earlier times, before the expression within the curly brackets is
computed. With the aid of the time ordering operator, we can deﬁne a matrix
X as

X := T

∆t W (ν∆t) + 1

.

The time ordering in the deﬁnition of X is necessary because the matrices W(t)
and W(t′) do not generally commute for t 6= t′. The matrix X is of course nothing
but a discrete approximation of the monodromy matrix known from the theory
of diﬀerential equations with periodic coeﬃcients [9].

With the deﬁnition of X, Eq. (2) becomes for the special choice t = 0

y(T ) = Xy(0) .

(4)

Hence, if we count the time in multiples of T , the system appears to evolve in
a static replication landscape. Therefore, it is possible to map the Eigen model
in a periodic landscape onto one in a ﬁxed landscape. For the static landscape
deﬁned by X, the asymptotic steady state is deﬁned by the eigenvector of X
corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, the Perron eigenvector φ0.

If we write the time as t = mT + ζ∆t, with m, ζ ∈ N and ζ < n = T /∆t, we
can write down a complete solution of the system. We start counting the time
at the beginning of the oscillation period. We then have

y(t) = T

∆t W (ν∆t) + 1

Xmy(0) .

The Perron eigenvector φ0 gives us the state of the system at the beginning of
each period, once the steady state has been reached. If we are interested in the
state at later times ζ∆t, we have to multiply φ0 with the expression

ζ−1

(

.

(6)

)

Similarly, the evolution of a complete period can be obtained by successively
multiplying a factor [∆t W(t + ∆t) + 1] from the left to the state vector obtained
for time t.

The Perron eigenvector φ0 can in many cases be obtained without a complete
diagonalization of X. If the quotient between the largest and the second largest
eigenvalue λ0/λ1 is much larger than 1, the iterated multiplication of X with an
initially arbitrarily chosen vector ψ, where ψ · φ0 6= 0, quickly singles out the
vector φ0. The quasispecies distributions in the present work were obtained in
that fashion. For the problems considered here, the method works exceptionally
well, with convergence after just a few steps.

3 Evolution as signal processing

Let us study quantitatively the eﬀects a periodic replication landscape has on the
prominent quasispecies. As the ﬁrst step into that direction, we start from the
Swetina-Schuster landscape [10] and introduce small oscillations in the master
sequence’s replication coeﬃcient A0. For reasons of simplicity, we set all decay
constants Di(t) = 0.

We get a smooth crossover from a ﬁxed landscape to one with considerable

dynamics if we write the time-dependent replication coeﬃcient A0(t) as

A0(t) = A0,stat exp[ǫf (t)] ,

(7)

where A0,stat is the replication coeﬃcient in the static landscape, ǫ is a small
number, and f (t) is a T -periodic function, and then successively increase the
parameter ǫ from 0 up to values well above 1. We have chosen the exponential
form in Eq. (7) since it guarantees that A0(t) will never become negative. The
replication coeﬃcients A1 = · · · = Al = A of all other sequences apart from
the master are kept constant. We are going to choose A so small that the con-
dition A ≪ A0(t) is satisﬁed for all t and ǫ ≪ 1. This assures that we see a
clear transition from the static case to the dynamic case, and additionally, that
the changes in the master sequence’s abundance can be directly related to the
changes in A0(t).

One of the simplest forms the function f (t) in Eq. (7) can take on is

with ω = 2π/T . In the following, we will mainly consider this time dependency.

f (t) = sin(ωt)

Fig. 1. The steady state oscillations of the master sequence in cyclically changing
environments with diﬀerent oscillation periods T . All parameters are as given in
the text. The slower the environmental oscillation, the better does the master
sequence track it.

As a starting point, we consider the extremely simple case of binary sequences
of length l = 2. We have four diﬀerent sequences in that case, grouped into
three error classes. Let the master replicate with A0(t) = A0,stat exp[ǫ sin(ωt)],
A0,stat = e2.4, ǫ = 0.2, ω = 2π, and the one- and two-mutant error classes with
A1(t) = A2(t) = 1. The asymptotic quasispecies for this setting is very similar
to the one obtained from a static landscape [10]. For R = 0, the master sequence
thrives, while the one and two error mutants have vanishing concentration. With
increasing R, the d = 1 and d = 2 error classes gain ground, while the master se-
quence’s concentration declines. For R = 1/2, the point of stochastic replication
is reached. Beyond R = 1/2, wrongly copied bits are more likely than faithfully
copied ones. Ultimately, for R close to one, the inverse master sequence prevails.
Because of the similarities with the static case, we have refrained from displaying
a graph of the quasispecies here.

Figure 1 shows the change in the master sequence’s concentration over the
whole oscillation period, for several diﬀerent period lengths T . The error rate is
R = 0.1. The master sequence dominates the population for that R. With the
chosen ǫ = 0.2, we are still very close to the static landscape. The oscillations in
A0(t) present only a slight perturbation of the static case. The master’s response
to the sinusoidally changing f (t) is an oscillatory modulation in the concentra-
tion. The form of the modulation is also sinusoidal, with diﬀerent amplitudes
and phase shifts when T is varied. We observe that the oscillation’s amplitude
dwindles with decreasing T , and the phase shift moves towards an asymptotic
value π/2. In the opposite direction, for increasing T , the phase shift dwindles
and the amplitude reaches a saturation level.

The amplitude and phase responses are caused by the ﬁnite time a reac-
tion system as described by Eigen’s equation needs to settle into equilibrium.

Under constant environmental conditions, the asymptotic species distribution is
approached in exponential time, with the relaxation time scale set by the dif-
ference between the largest and the second-largest eigenvalue. For oscillations
occurring on a time scale much larger than the relaxation time, the system is
virtually in equilibrium at every single moment in time. It follows closely the
changes in the environmental conditions, and the quasispecies at time t is identi-
cal to the one in a static replication landscape with replication coeﬃcients frozen
at time t. When T is of the order of the relaxation time, the system cannot track
the changes perfectly any more. It gets into a state of constantly running after
the optimal concentrations’ setting, without ever getting there. This is when the
phase shift sets in. The sequence’s concentration starts growing at the beginning
of the oscillation period, when the replication coeﬃcient rises. Because of its
backlog, however, the concentration is still growing when the replication coef-
ﬁcient is already past its maximum, decreasing again. This produces the phase
shift, and forces the amplitude to shrink. For extremely small T , the system’s re-
sponse to the environmental changes are so slow that the replication coeﬃcients
have already ﬁnished a whole oscillation period before a measurable alteration
in the quasispecies can occur. In this regime, the amplitude vanishes, leaving
a constant quasispecies whose composition is determined by the time averaged
replication coeﬃcients.

Phase and amplitude responses are not a new observation for evolutionary
dynamics under cyclically varying environmental conditions. Similar observa-
tions have been made in studies of standard population genetics models with
a single time varying optimum. Lande and Shannon [11] calculated the steady
state response of a population evolving towards a cyclically changing optimum,
extending the work of Charlesworth [12] who studied a discrete model with non-
overlapping generations. Hirst [13, 14] has shown that the steady state response
found by Lande and Shannon can be interpreted as the response of a ﬁrst or-
der, low pass Butterworth ﬁlter [15] to the input signal and that in a similar
manner, the results obtained by Charlesworth can be interpreted as a digital
ﬁlter. Hirst [13] therefore proposed the notion of Evolutionary Signal Process-
ing. Earlier works had already established a qualitative equivalence between the
behavior of a population genetics model and a low pass ﬁlter [16, 17]. Similar
results are also known from studies with evolutionary strategies [18].

In comparing the above cited results, in particular the ones by Lande and
Shannon and the ones by Charlesworth, with our ﬁndings here, we have to be
very careful about identifying quantities in the diﬀerent models with each other.
In the population genetics models, input and output of the ﬁlter live in the same
mathematical space, which is the abstract 1-d real valued phenotype space. The
situation is very diﬀerent in Eigen’s model. First of all, here the input and the
output signal live in diﬀerent spaces. The input signal is a replication landscape,
while the output signal is a genotype. And second of all, both input and output
are high-dimensional entities. Only the projection onto the master’s replication
coeﬃcient and the master’s concentration enables us to interpret the system’s
response as the output of an analog ﬁlter.

Fig. 2. The inﬂuence of ǫ on the steady state oscillations of the master sequence.
The sinusoidal form gets quickly destroyed for increasing ǫ.

So far, we have only considered a relatively small ǫ. If we disturb the system
more profoundly, the picture changes considerably. An example of larger pertur-
bations in the replication coeﬃcient A0(t) is given in Fig. 2. There, we have kept
the oscillation period ﬁxed (T = 10), and have explored several diﬀerent ǫ. On
ﬁrst glance we realize that the sinusoidal form gets quickly distorted for larger ǫ.
The case ǫ = 0.2, which corresponds to the situation of Fig. 1, is the only one
for which a sine can be recognized. In all other cases, the maximum peak gets
damped as compared to the minimum peak. And this happens even though the
maximal replication coeﬃcient gets exponentially ampliﬁed because of Eq. (7).
But of course the relation between x0(t) and A0(t) cannot be linear, nor loga-
rithmic [which would remove the exponential in Eq. (7) and leave a true sine],
because x0(t) cannot grow beyond 1. Even with an inﬁnite replication coeﬃcient
A0(t) the concentration of the master sequence reaches just the value 1.

The distorted responses displayed in Fig. 2 show that the notion of Evolu-
tionary Signal Processing is only of limited value for the time-dependent Eigen
model. Standard signal processing ﬁlters don’t show such responses.

4 A moving error threshold

Now we are going to move on to larger l, and to investigate to what extend the
error threshold is aﬀected by the ﬂuctuating replication coeﬃcients.

In Fig. 3 we have plotted the asymptotic quasispecies in a system of bi-
nary sequences with length l as a function of the error rate R. The sequences
are replicating in a dynamic Swetina-Schuster landscape with parameter setting
A0,stat = e2.4, T = 0.1, A1 = · · · = A20 = 1, ǫ = 2, and n = 100 time steps per
oscillation. We observe a clear error threshold, very similar to the situation in a
static landscape. The error threshold at R = 0.151 is indicated in the plot with
the label R∗
av. The subscript “av” has been chosen because the error threshold

Note that with ω = 2π/T = 20π, the oscillation frequency is considerably high

The other two error rates indicated in the plot, R∗

correspond to the error threshold in a static landscape with A′
0 taking on the
minimal or the maximal value of A0(t), respectively. Outside of the interval
deﬁned by [R∗
max], we expect the quasispecies distribution to remain largely
unaltered as long as we only change the oscillation frequency or the phase at
which we are looking at the system.

In Fig. 4, the same system is displayed for T = 100. Any sign of a transition
at R∗
av has disappeared, and a new error threshold has formed. However, this
new error threshold is much softer than the one obtained in a static landscape.
This indicates that the oscillation is still inﬂuencing the composition of the
quasispecies at that point in time. Ultimately, for T → ∞, a snapshot of the
system at a particular phase must be indistinguishable from a system with a
static landscape. Since this is not the case in Fig. 4, we know that for T = 100
this particular system is still in an intermediate regime, where neither the average
replication landscape nor the replication landscape at time t fully determine the
quasispecies distribution at time t.

min and R∗

The details of this dynamics are shown in Fig. 5. The plots show the quasis-
pecies’ change over the whole oscillation period for diﬀerent error rates R. It is
clearly visible that the error threshold sets in at diﬀerent error rates for diﬀerent
phases of the oscillation. This eﬀect is best seen in the plots on the second row,
for R = 0.10 and R = 0.14. The sequences are clearly past the error threshold at
the beginning of the oscillation period. Nevertheless, at a phase slightly below
π/2, the quasispecies forms rapidly and stays almost unaltered for about one
quarter of the oscillation period. Then it decays, a bit softer than it has formed,
and the sequence distribution is again unordered.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have extended Eigen’s quasispecies theory to time dependent
replication landscapes. For periodic time dependency, the sequences’ evolution
over a complete period can be mapped onto a single evolution step in a ﬁxed land-
scape. This allows to deﬁne a meaningful asymptotic quasispecies. For small os-
cillations in the replication coeﬃcients, the quasispecies’ concentrational changes
can be interpreted as the response of a low-pass ﬁlter. However, this equivalence
disappears for increasing oscillation amplitudes. The most interesting eﬀect is
the oscillation’s inﬂuence on the error threshold. For high frequencies ω, the error
threshold appears at the position corresponding to the time averaged replication
landscape. It starts to soften and to change its position during the oscillation

when the frequency ω is lowered. For extremely low ω, the error threshold be-
comes sharp again, but now its position oscillates in accordance with the replica-

error threshold, being in the ordered phase at one moment and in the unordered
one the next moment.

In a forthcoming paper [19], we are going to study in a similar way an exactly
solvable class of dynamic replication landscapes. By mapping them onto a spin
system, we will also show that these landscapes do not exhibit an error transition
in the sense of a phase transition.

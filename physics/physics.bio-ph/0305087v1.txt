Abstract

Experimental observations suggest that proteins follow diﬀerent pathways under diﬀerent environ-
mental conditions. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a model of the SH3 domain over a
broad range of temperatures, and identify distinct pathways in the folding transition. We determine the
kinetic partition temperature —the temperature for which the SH3 domain undergoes a rapid folding
transition with minimal kinetic barriers— and observe that below this temperature the model protein
may undergo a folding transition via multiple folding pathways. The folding kinetics is characterized
by slow and fast pathways and the presence of only one or two intermediates. Our ﬁndings suggest the
hypothesis that the SH3 domain, a protein for which only two-state folding kinetics was observed in pre-
vious experiments, may exhibit intermediates states under extreme experimental conditions, such as very
low temperatures. A very recent report (Viguera et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 100:5730–5735,
2003) of an intermediate in the folding transition of the Bergerac mutant of the α-spectrin SH3 domain
protein supports this hypothesis.

Keywords: intermediate, molecular dynamics, folding pathways, SH3, kinetic partition.

INTRODUCTION

our results in light of recent experimental evidence.

Recent experimental studies indicate that several
proteins exhibit simultaneously a variety of interme-
diates and folding pathways. Kiefhaber1 identiﬁed
at low denaturant concentration a fast pathway (50
ms) in the folding of lyzosyme with no intermediates
and a slow phase (420 ms) with well-populated inter-
mediates. Choe et al.2 observed the formation of a
kinetic intermediate in the folding of villin 14T upon
decreasing the temperature, and Silverman et al.3 ob-
served the extinction of a slow phase in the folding
of the P4-P6 domain upon changes in ion concentra-
tion. Kitahara et al.4 studied a pressure-stabilized in-
termediate of ubiquitin, identiﬁed as an oﬀ-pathway
intermediate in previous kinetics experiments at basic
conditions5. All these studies suggest that environ-
mental conditions favor some folding pathways over
others.

Major theoretical eﬀorts in the study of protein
folding6–16 have focused on small, single domain pro-
It is found in experiments17, 18 that these

proteins undergo folding transition with no accumu-
lation of kinetic intermediates in the accessible range
of experimental conditions. However, other kinetics
studies of two-state proteins19–22 suggest the pres-
ence of short-lived intermediates that cannot be di-
rectly detected experimentally. Recently, S´anchez et
al.23 explained the curved Chevron plots — the non-
linear dependence of folding and unfolding rates on
denaturant concentration24–26 — of 17 selected pro-
teins by assuming the presence of an intermediate
state. Led by these studies, we hypothesize that sin-
gle domain proteins may exhibit intermediates in the
folding transition under suitable environmental con-
ditions.

To test our hypothesis, we perform a molecular
dynamics study of the folding pathways of the c-Crk
SH3 domain27–29 (PDB29 access code 1cka). The SH3
domain is a family of small globular proteins which
has been extensively studied in kinetics and thermo-
dynamics experiments18, 30–37. We select the c-Crk
SH3 domain (57 residues) as the SH3 domain rep-
resentative and perform molecular dynamics simula-
tions over a broad range of temperatures. We de-
termine the kinetic partition temperature12, 38 TKP
below which the model protein exhibits slow folding
pathways and above which the protein undergoes a
cooperative folding transition with no accumulation
of intermediates. Below TKP , we study the presence
of intermediates in the slow folding pathways and re-
solve their structure. We ﬁnd that one of the inter-
mediates populates the folding transition for temper-
atures as high as TKP . We discuss the relevance of

RESULTS

The SH3 domain is a β-sheet protein (upper trian-
gle of Fig. 1a). Our previous thermodynamic studies6
of the c–Crk SH3 domain revealed only two stable
states at equilibrium conditions: folded and unfolded.
Both states coexist with equal probability at the fold-
ing transition temperature, TF = 0.626, at which the
temperature dependence of the potential energy has
a sharp change, and the speciﬁc heat has a maximum
(experimentally18, this temperature corresponds to
67◦C). Thus, our model reproduces the experimentally-
determined thermodynamics of the SH3 domain18, 30, 31.

Initial Unfolded Ensemble

Our initially unfolded ensemble consists of 1100
protein conformations that we sample from a long
equilibrium simulation at a high temperature T0 =
1.0 at equal time intervals of 104 time units (t.u).
This time separation is long enough to ensure that the
sampled conformations have low structural similarity
among themselves. We calculate the frequency map
— the plot of the probability of any two amino acids
forming a contact — of this unfolded ensemble (lower
triangle of Fig. 1a). At T = 1.0, only nearest and
next nearest contacts have high frequency, and the
frequency decreases rapidly with the sequence sepa-
ration between the amino acids.

When we quench the system from T = 1.0 to a
target temperature, Ttarget (see Methods), the sys-
tem relaxes in approximately 1500 t.u. Due to the
ﬁnite size of our heat bath, the heat released by the
protein upon folding increases the ﬁnal temperature
of the system by 0.03 units above Ttarget. After re-
laxation, the protein stays for a certain time in the
unfolded state, then undergoes a folding transition.
During this time interval, the protein explores un-
folded conformations, and we calculate the frequency
map of the unfolded state for diﬀerent target temper-
atures.

At Ttarget = TF , the secondary structure is unsta-
ble (Fig. 1b), with average frequency ¯f = 0.24 (see
Methods). Successful folding requires the coopera-
tive formation of contacts throughout the protein in
a nucleation process6, 7. At Ttarget = 0.54, the sec-
ondary structure is more stable (Fig. 1c, ¯f = 0.50).
Thus, the conformational search for the native state
(NS) is optimized by limiting the search to the for-
mation of a suﬃcient number of long range contacts.
At Ttarget = 0.33, the lowest temperature studied,
secondary structure elements form during the rapid
collapse of the model protein in the ﬁrst 1500 t.u.

2

(Fig. 1d, ¯f = 0.73). During collapse, some tertiary
contacts — contacts between secondary elements —
may also form. The formation of these contacts prior
to the proper arrangement of secondary structure el-
ements may lead the protein model to a kinetic trap.
Finally, folding proceeds at this temperature through
a thermally activated search for the NS.

Kinetic Partition Temperature

In order to determine the temperature below which
we can distinguish fast and slow folding pathways,
we compute the distribution of folding times p(tF , T )
(Fig. 2a–e), as well as the average htF i (Fig. 2f) and
standard deviation σF . The ratio r(T ) ≡ htF i/σF
measures the average folding time in units of the
standard deviation σF . This quantity is particularly
useful when the value of the standard deviation cor-
relates with the value of the average as we change
Ttarget. For instance, single-exponential distributions
e−tF /htF i/htF i have r ≡ 1.

We expect r → 1 for Ttarget > TF , because at
these high temperatures the folding transitions be-
come rare events and are single-exponential distributed.
As we decrease Ttarget, we expect r > 1 just below TF ,
because the folded state becomes more stable than
the unfolded state, and the folding transitions are
favored. Distributions with r > 1 indicate a narrow
distribution centered in htF i, so that most of the sim-
ulations undergo a folding transition for times of the
order of the average folding time. However, if we con-
tinue decreasing Ttarget, we expect some folding tran-
sitions to be kinetically trapped, and the folding time
distribution will spread over several orders of magni-
tudes. Such distributions have r < 1. Thus, there is
a temperature below TF where the maximum of r(T )
occurs, and which signals the onset of slow folding
pathways. We use the maximum of r(T ) to calculate
TKP .

Fig. 2g suggests that TKP = 0.54, which corre-
sponds to a maximally compact distribution of fold-
ing times∗ (Fig. 2d). We ﬁnd that the ratio ap-
proaches one as we increase the temperature above
TKP , and the distribution of folding times approxi-
mates a single-exponential distribution. In particu-
lar, the distribution of folding times ﬁts the single-
exponential distribution e−tF /htF i/htF i for T = 0.64,
the closest temperature to TF that we study. The
ratio r(T ) decreases monotonically below TKP , indi-
cating that the distribution of folding times spreads
over several orders of magnitude. This is the conse-
quence of an increasing fraction of folding simulations
∗Assuming a linear relation between experimental and simu-
lated temperatures and taking into account18 that TF = 67◦C,
we estimate TKP ≃ 20◦C

kinetically trapped (Fig. 2a-b). The average folding
time htF i is minimal not at TKP , but at a lower tem-
perature ThtF i = 0.49 (Fig. 2f). At this temperature,
we ﬁnd that the protein becomes temporarily trapped
in approximately 7% of the folding transitions. On
the other hand, the remaining simulations undergo a
folding transition much faster, thus minimizing htF i.
Interestingly, r(ThtF i) ≃ 1.0, even though the distri-
bution of folding times at this temperature is non-
exponential.

Folding Pathways

Below TKP , an increasing fraction of the simula-
tions undergo folding transitions that take a time up
to three orders of magnitude above the minimal htF i.
In addition, htF i increases dramatically (Fig. 2f). At
the lowest temperatures studied, we distinguish be-
tween the majority of simulations that undergo a fast
folding transition (the fast pathway) and the rest of
the simulations that undergo folding transitions with
folding times spanning three orders of magnitude (the
slow pathways). At the low temperature T = 0.33,
the potential energy of the fast pathway has on av-
erage the same time evolution of all the simulations
at TKP = 0.54, indicating that there are no kinetic
traps in the fast pathway.

For each folding simulation that belongs to the
slow pathways, we sample the potential energy at
equal time intervals of 100 t.u. until folding is ﬁnished
(see Methods). Then, we collect all potential energy
values and construct a distribution of potential ener-
gies. We ﬁnd that below T = 0.43, the distribution is
markedly bimodal (Fig. 3a). The positions of the two
peaks along the energy coordinate do not correspond
to the equilibrium potential energy value of the folded
state (Fig. 3b). Therefore we hypothesize the exis-
tence of two intermediates in the slow pathways. We
denote the two putative intermediates as I1 and I2 for
the high energy and low energy peaks, respectively.
As temperature decreases, the peaks shift to lower
energies, but the energy diﬀerence between the two
peaks, approximately six energy units, remains con-
stant (Fig. 3b). A constant energy diﬀerence implies
that the two putative intermediates diﬀer by a spe-
ciﬁc set of native contacts. As temperature decreases,
other contacts not belonging to this set become more
stable and are responsible for the overall energy de-
crease. At T = 0.33, we record the distribution of
survival times for both intermediates and ﬁnd that
they ﬁt a single-exponential distribution, supporting
the hypothesis that each intermediate is a local free
energy minima and has a major free energy barrier
(Fig. 3c).

3

To further test the single free energy barrier hy-
pothesis, we select a typical conformation represent-
ing intermediate I2 and perform 200 folding simula-
tions, each with a diﬀerent set of initial velocities for
a set of temperatures in the range 0.33 ≤ T ≤ 0.52.
For each simulation, we record the time that the pro-
tein stays in the intermediate and ﬁnd that the aver-
age survival time ﬁts the Arrhenius law for temper-
atures below T = 0.44 (Fig. 3d). This upper bound
temperature roughly coincides with the temperature
T = 0.43 below which I2 becomes noticeable in the
histogram of potential energies (Fig. 3a). This result
indicates that the free energy barrier to overcome in-
termediate I2 becomes independent of temperature
for low temperatures, or analogously, that the same
set of native contacts must form (or break) to over-
come the intermediate.

Next, we determine the structure of the two in-
termediates. For each intermediate, we randomly se-
lect three conformations and ﬁnd that they are struc-
turally similar. Conformations belonging to interme-
diate I1 have a set of long-range contacts (C1) with a
high occupancy and a set of long-range contacts (C2)
with no occupancy at all (Fig. 3e). Contacts in C1
represent a β-sheet made by three strands: the two
termini and the strand following the RT-loop, which
we name strand “A” (see I1 in Fig. 4). Contacts in
C2 represent the base of the n-Src loop and the con-
tacts between the RT-loop and the distal hairpin (see
I2 in Fig. 4). In addition, I1 has a set of medium-
range contacts (C3) with high occupancy (Fig. 3e)
representing the distal hairpin and a part of the n-Src
loop. For a slow folding transition, the β-sheet (C1
contacts) forms in the early events and strand “A”
can no longer move freely. This constrained motion
prevents strand “A” from forming contacts with one
of the strands of the distal hairpin, which we name as
strand “B” (see I2 in Fig. 4). Similarly, strand “B”
cannot move freely because it is a part of C3. The
missing contacts between strand “A” and strand “B”
are the contacts that form the base of the n-Src loop.
Conformational changes leading the protein away
from intermediate I1 involve either dissociation of the
β-sheet, thus breaking some contacts of C1, or disso-
ciation of the distal hairpin, thus breaking some con-
tacts of C3. We ﬁnd that the latter dissociation may
lead the protein conformation to intermediate I2. In-
termediate I2 has contacts of C1, but lacks the set
of contacts (C4) that form the base of the the distal
hairpin (see NS in Fig. 4).

Once we identify the structure of the intermedi-
ates, we investigate whether intermediate I1 is present
at larger temperatures when no distinction can be
made concerning fast and slow folding pathways. To

test this hypothesis, we sample the protein conforma-
tion during the folding transition at equal time inter-
vals of 60 t.u. for each of the 1100 simulations, and
compare these conformations to intermediate I1 with
a similarity score function (see Methods). For each
folding transition, we record only the highest value of
the similarity score, thus obtaining 1100 highest score
values. At TKP , the histogram of the highest scores is
bimodal, with 25% of the folding simulations passing
through intermediate I1 (Fig. 3f). We ﬁnd that at
TKP , simulations that undergo the folding transition
through I1 show kinetics of folding no diﬀerent than
those of the rest of simulations.

DISCUSSION

It was shown6 that the simpliﬁed protein model
and interaction potentials that we use here repro-
duced in a certain range of temperatures the
experimentally-determined two-state thermodynam-
ics of the SH3 domain18. The qualitative predictive
power of the model encouraged us to study the folding
kinetics in a wider range of temperatures. From our
relaxation studies of the initial unfolded ensemble,
we observe that the structure of the unfolded state is
highly sensitive to Ttarget. The role of the unfolded
state in determining the folding kinetics has already
been pointed out in recent experimental and theo-
retical studies39–42. We observe nucleation6, folding
with minimal kinetic barriers, and thermally acti-
vated mechanisms for the diﬀerent observed unfolded
states.

In previous studies, various methods have been
developed to determine the temperature that signals
the onset of slow folding pathways. Socci et al.43, 44
determined a glass transition temperature, Tg, at which
the average folding time is half way between tmin and
tmax, where tmin is the minimun average folding time
and tmax is the total simulation time. This method
is sensitive to the a priori selected tmax. The au-
thors varied tmax in the range 0.27 × 109 < tmax <
0.960 × 109, and they found a 10% error in the cal-
culation of Tg. Also, Gutin et al.45 estimated a crit-
ical temperature, Tc, at which the temperature de-
pendence of the equilibrium potential energy leveled
oﬀ. From their results, one can evaluate a 20% error
in their calculation of Tc. Both Tg and Tc are tem-
peratures that authors use to characterize the onset
of multiple folding pathways.
In our study we use
TKP , which signals the breaking of time translational
invariance of equilibrium measurements for temper-
atures below this value46. We estimate a 2% error
in our calculation of TKP from uncertainties in the
location of TKP in Fig. 2g.

At TKP , secondary structure elements are par-
tially stable, and the search for the NS reduces to the
formation of tertiary contacts. Furthermore, TKP is
a relatively high temperature that prevents the stabi-
lization of improper arrangements of the protein con-
formation, thus minimizing the occurrence of kinetic
traps. Below TKP , the model protein exhibits two in-
termediates with well-deﬁned structural characteris-
tics. This modest number of intermediates is a direct
consequence of the prevention of non-native contacts.
This prevention reduces dramatically the number of
protein conformations. Furthermore, since a low en-
ergy value implies that most of the native interactions
have formed, there are few conformations having both
low energy and structural diﬀerences with the NS11.
It is found experimentally 1–3, 47–54 that proteins
exhibit only a discrete set of intermediates. Even
though in real proteins amino acids that do not form
a native contact may still attract each other, exper-
imental and theoretical studies conﬁrm that native
contacts have a leading role in the folding transi-
tion. Protein engineering experiments33, 55–58 show
that transition states in two-state globular proteins
are mostly stabilized by native interactions. To quan-
titatively determine the importance of native inter-
actions in the folding transition, Paci et al.59 studied
the transition states of three two-state proteins with
a full-atom model. They found that on average, na-
tive interactions accounted for approximately 83% of
the total energy of the transition states. Of relevance
to our studies of the SH3 domain are the full-atom
study60 and the protein engineering experiments33, 36
showing that the transition state of the src-SH3 do-
main protein is determined by the NS. On the other
hand, evidence exists that in some proteins, non-
native contacts are responsible for the presence of
intermediates. In their study of the homologous Im7
and Im9 proteins, Capaldi et al.61 identiﬁed a set of
non-native interactions responsible for a intermediate
state in the folding transition of Im7 protein. Mirny
et al.62 performed Monte Carlo simulations of two
diﬀerent sequences with the same NS in the 3 × 3
lattice. One sequence presented a series of pathways
with misfolded states due to non-native interactions.
We investigate the kinetics of formation of the
two intermediates in a wide range of temperatures.
At low temperatures, simulations that undergo fold-
ing through intermediate I1 reveal that contacts be-
tween the two termini form earlier than the contacts
belonging to the folding nucleus6, 7. This result co-
incides with an oﬀ-lattice study63 of a 36-monomer
protein by Abkevich et al.
In this study, the au-
thors found an intermediate in the folding transition

diate revealed no nucleus contacts, but a diﬀerent
set of long-range contacts already formed. In addi-
tion, we learned of the work by Viguera et al.64 af-
ter completion of our study. They reported that a
mutant of the α-spectrin SH3 domain undergoes a
folding transition through one intermediate. The au-
thors observed that the newly-introduced long-range
contacts had already been formed in the denaturated
state, preceding the formation of the transition state
of the protein. Thus, environmental conditions that
favor stabilization of long-range contacts other than
the nucleus contacts may induce intermediates in the
folding transition.

Alternatively, short-range contacts in key posi-
tions of the protein structure may also be responsible
for slow folding pathways. After completion of our
study, Karanicolas et al.65, 66 reported their studies
on the G¯o model of the forming binding protein WW
domain. The authors found a slow folding pathway in
the model protein, and a cluster of four short-range
native contacts that are responsible for this pathway.
However, the authors observed that it was the ab-
sence, not the presence, of these native contacts in
the unfolded state that generated bi-phasic folding
kinetics. Thus, environmental conditions that favor
destabilization of short range contacts may promote
the formation of intermediate states in the folding
transition.

We also investigate the survival time of interme-
diate I2, and ﬁnd that the free energy barrier sepa-
rating I2 from the NS is independent of temperature.
Thus, the average survival time follows Arrhenius ki-
netics. The value of the free energy barrier is approx-
imately 5.85 energy units, indicating that about six
native contacts break when the protein conformation
reaches the transition state that separates I2 from the
NS. At the low temperatures where intermediates I1
and I2 are noticeable, thermal ﬂuctuations are still
large enough so that the observed survival times of
I2 should be much smaller, if only any six native con-
tacts were to break. Thus we hypothesize that it
is allways the same set of native contact that must
break in the transition I2 → N S. Our observations
of the transition I1 → I2 support this hypothesis. In
this transition, we ﬁnd that the set of contacts C4
allways breaks.

At TKP , we do not detect the intermediates from
kinetics measurements of the average folding time,
or analogously, from the folding rate. Thus we an-
alyze the folding transition with the similarity score
function that tests the presence of intermediate I1.
Then we ﬁnd that this intermediate is populated in
25% of the folding transitions. In a recent study67,
Gorski et al. reported the existence of an interme-

5

diate in the folding transition of protein Im9 under
acidic conditions (pH = 5.5). This ﬁnding led au-
thors to formulate the hypothesis that Im9 has an
intermediate at normal conditions (pH = 7.0), but it
is too unstable to be detected with current kinetic ex-
perimental techniques. Interestingly, the homologous
protein Im7 (60% sequence identity) undergoes fold-
ing transition through an intermediate in all tested
experimental conditions61, 67, 68, supporting the au-
thors’ hypothesis. Thus, changes in both the environ-
mental conditions and the amino acid sequence may
uncover hidden intermediates in the folding transi-
tion of a two-state protein.
In addition, a detailed
study at TKP may reveal the intermediates. This is
particularly useful for computer simulations, because
simulations at low temperatures when intermediates
are easily identiﬁable may require several orders of
magnitude longer than simulations at TKP .

Conclusion

We perform molecular dynamics analysis of the
folding transition of the G¯o model of the c-Crk SH3
domain in a broad range of temperatures. At the fold-
ing transition temperature, we observe that only the
folded and unfolded states are populated. However,
as we decrease the temperature, parameters monitor-
ing the folding process such as potential energy and
root mean square distance with respect to the native
state, rmsd, suggest the presence of intermediates.
We determine the kinetic partition temperature TKP
below which we observe two folding intermediates, I1
and I2, and above which we do not observe accumu-
lation of intermediates. Below TKP , intermediate I1
forms when the two termini and the strand following
the RT-loop form a β-sheet, prior to the formation
of the folding nucleus. This intermediate eﬀectively
splits the folding transition into fast and slow folding
pathways. Dissociation of part of the β-sheet leads
the protein to the native state. We also ﬁnd that sta-
bilization of this β-sheet and subsequent dissociation
of the distal hairpin may lead to intermediate I2.

The key structural characteristics of intermediate
I1 allow us to deﬁne a similarity score function that
probes the presence of the intermediate in a folding
transition. We ﬁnd that I1 is populated even at TKP .
This result suggests that one can obtain information
regarding the existence of putative intermediates by
studying the folding trajectories at TKP . However,
at this temperature, no intermediates are noticeable
if one limits the analysis only to the distribution of
folding times.

We observe that the folding pathways of the model
SH3 domain are highly sensitive to temperature, sug-
gesting the important role of the environmental con-

ditions in determining the folding mechanism. Our
ﬁndings suggest that the SH3 domain, a two-state
folder, may exhibit stable intermediates under ex-
treme experimental conditions, such as very low tem-
peratures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Model Protein and Interactions

We adopt a coarse-grained description of the pro-
tein by which each amino acid is reduced to its Cβ
atom (Cα in case of Gly). Details of the model, the
surrounding heat bath, and the selection of struc-
tural parameters are discussed in detail in a previous
study6. The selection of the set of interaction pa-
rameters among amino acids is of crucial importance
for the resulting folding kinetics of the model pro-
tein 11, 12, 14. Experimental and theoretical studies of
globular proteins 6, 7, 36, 57, 69–76 suggest that native
topology is the principal determinant of the folding
mechanism. Thus, we employ a variant of the G¯o
model of interactions12, 77–81 — a model based solely
on the native topology — in which we prevent for-
mation of non-native interactions, since we are solely
interested in the role that native topology and na-
tive interactions may have in the formation of in-
termediates. We perform simulations and monitor
the time evolution of the protein and the heat bath
with the discrete molecular dynamics algorithm 82–88.
The higher performance of this algorithm over con-
ventional molecular dynamics allows one to increase
the computational speed up to three orders of mag-
nitude.

Frequencies and Folding Simulations

To calculate the frequency map at T = 1.0, we
probe the presence of the native contacts in each of
the 1100 initially unfolded conformations. Then, we
compute the probability of each native contact to be
present. To calculate the frequency map at Ttarget, we
select one particular folding transition and we probe
the presence of the native contacts during the time
interval that spans after the initial relaxation and be-
fore the simulation reaches the folding time tF . To
compute tF , we stop the folding simulation when 90%
of the native contacts form. Then, we trace back
the folding trajectory and record tF when the root
mean square distance with respect to the native state,
rmsd, becomes smaller than 3˚A. We consider all pro-
tein conformations occurring for t > tF as belonging
to the folded state and of no relevance to the folding

6

transition.

Similarity Score Function

We introduce the similarity score function, S =
(a/23)(15 − b)/15, where a is the number of native
contacts belonging to the set of contacts C1, and b
is the number of native contacts belonging to set C2
(Fig. 3e). C1 has 23 contacts and C2 has 15 contacts.
If the protein is unfolded, then a ≈ b ≈ 0, thus S ≈ 0.
Similarly, if the protein is folded, then a ≈ 23 and
b ≈ 15, thus S ≈ 0 again. Finally, if the protein
adopts the intermediate I1 structure, then a ≈ 23
and b ≈ 0, thus S ≈ 1.

T = 0.44. This upper bound temperature coincides
with the temperature below which the distribution
of the potential energies (Fig. 3a) of the slow fold-
ing pathways becomes bimodal. (e) Upper triangle:
Absent contacts (ﬁlled squares) and present contacts
(crosses, “C4”) in intermediate I1. Upon the tran-
sition I1 → I2, these contacts reverse their presence
(so that the ﬁlled squares are the present contacts and
the crosses are the absent contacts). There are ﬁve
more squares than crosses, which roughly accounts
for the diﬀerence of six energy units between the two
intermediates. Lower triangle:
long-range contacts
“C1” are present in intermediate I1, and long-range
contacts “C2” are absent. There are 23 contacts in
“C1” and 15 contacts in “C2”. (f) Probability that a
folding transition at T = TKP = 0.54 contains a pro-
tein conformation with similarity S to intermediate
I1 (see Methods).

Figure 4: Schematic diagram of fast and slow fold-
ing pathways. At T = 0.33, approximately in 15% of
the simulations, the model protein undergoes a fold-
ing transition through the slow folding pathways. We
show the protein structure in I1 and I2 using the
secondary structural elements of the native state, al-
In
though some of these elements are not formed.
intermediate I1, both termini and the strand A form
a β-sheet (in the ellipse). The corresponding set of
native contacts is C1. Dissociation of the β-sheet
leads to rearrangements of the protein conformation
and successful folding to the native state (NS). How-
ever, dissociation of the distal hairpin (in red) leads
to more localized rearrangements that may lead the
protein to intermediate I2. Upon I1 → I2 transition,
contacts of C2 (the two ellipses in I2) form, but con-
tacts of C4 (the ellipse in NS) break.

Figure 1: (a) Upper triangle: c–Crk SH3 domain
contact map with 160 native contacts. The secondary
structure elements are the clusters of contacts that
are organized perpendicularly to the map diagonal.
Long-range contacts between the two termini are en-
closed in the circle, and long-range contacts between
the RT-loop and the distal hairpin are enclosed in the
square. Lower triangle: the frequency map for the
initial set of 1100 unfolded conformations at T = 1.0.
(b) Frequency map of the unfolded state at T = TF =
0.626. We compute the frequencies for a particular
folding transition, whose potential energy trajectory
we show in the inset (see Methods). Same for (c)
T = 0.54 and (d) T = 0.33, the lowest temperature
studied.

Figure 2: (a–e) Histograms of folding times for se-
lected temperatures. At T = 0.33 and T = 0.36, the
two lowest temperatures studied, histograms have a
maximum for long folding times (↓
), which suggests
the existence of putative intermediates. At T = 0.33,
a maximum in the histogram (↓+), not present at
T = 0.36, corresponds to short lived kinetic traps.
The distributions of folding times are unimodal at
higher temperatures. At T = 0.54, the histogram is
compact, and has no tail of long folding times. At
T = 0.64, the histogram ﬁts a single-exponential dis-
tribution e−tF /htF i/htF i for times larger than the re-
laxation time of 1500 t.u. (dashed line). We estimate
the errors of the histogram bars as the square root
of each bar.
(f) Average folding time versus tem-
perature. Each dot represents the folding time for a
particular folding transition. (g) Ratio r of the aver-
age and the standard deviation, r = htF i/σF , for the
distribution of folding times. The ratio approaches
one above TKP and zero below TKP . The ratio is
maximal at TKP , indicating a compact distribution
of folding times at this temperature.

ergies of the slow folding pathways for temperatures
below T = 0.43. The distributions are bimodal, sug-
(b)
gesting two putative intermediates I1 and I2.
The potential energy of the distribution peaks (✳
and #) increases with temperature, but the energy
diﬀerence between peaks remains constant. The en-
ergy of the peaks is signiﬁcantly larger than the equi-
librium energy of the folded state (△).

butions of survival times at T = 0.33 for the high
energy intermediate I1 (✳ ), htF i = 1.81 × 106 and

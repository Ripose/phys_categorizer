Abstract

Under special conditions bacteria excrete an attractant and aggregate. The
high density regions initially collapse into cylindrical structures, which sub-
sequently destabilize and break up into spherical aggregates. This paper
presents a theoretical description of the process, from the structure of the
collapsing cylinder to the spacing of the ﬁnal aggregates. We show that cylin-
drical collapse involves a delicate balance in which bacterial attraction and
diﬀusion nearly cancel, leading to corrections to the collapse laws expected
from dimensional analysis. The instability of a collapsing cylinder is com-
posed of two distinct stages: Initially, slow modulations to the cylinder de-
velop, which correspond to a variation of the collapse time along the cylinder
axis. Ultimately, one point on the cylinder pinches oﬀ. At this ﬁnal stage of
the instability, a front propagates from the pinch into the remainder of the
cylinder. The spacing of the resulting spherical aggregates is determined by
the front propagation.

The formation of a singularity—the divergence of a physical quantity in ﬁnite time—is
central to diverse ﬁelds [1], including nonlinear optics, gravitational collapse, and ﬂuid me-
chanics. The structure of singularities has been worked out in many examples for which a
physical quantity blows up at a spatial point [2–4]. Typically, singular dynamics are self-
similar: the characteristic scale separation between the singular and regular parts of the
solution leads to the slaving of the spatial structure to the time dependence via scaling laws.
The situation can be more complicated when many singularities form collectively and simul-
taneously. In this paper we analyze a simple example for which multiple singularities form
in a short time. This work was motivated by a recent experiment in bacterial chemotaxis
[5–7].

The experimental observation is shown in Figure 1. In the ﬁrst panel a diﬀuse cloud
of Escherichia coli covers the depth of a petri dish ﬁlled with agar. The environment is
prepared so that the E. coli excrete an attractant; each bacterium attracts all the other
bacteria, and a cloud can collapse.
In the second panel, the diﬀuse cloud collapses as a
cylindrical structure, with highest bacterial density on the cylinder axis. In the ﬁnal panel,
the cylinder breaks down into spherical aggregates. In this paper we analyze this process, by
constructing a similarity solution to describe the cylindrical collapse of bacteria, and then
analyzing its stability.

FIG. 1. Experiment showing formation and instability of a collapsing bacterial cylinder (Re-
produced from [7]). The ﬁrst panel shows a diﬀuse cloud of bacteria ﬁlling the depth of a petri
dish ﬁlled with agar, which then collapses (second panel) into a cylindrical structure. The cylinder
subsequently destablizes into spherical aggregates. Details of the experiments are described in
Budrene and Berg [5,6].

Chemotaxis in E. coli is an excellent model system for studying singularity formation.
The biochemical response of E. coli to a changing environment has been thoroughly char-
acterized [8–12] over the past twenty-ﬁve years, so we understand how the bacteria sense
and respond to their environment. As a consequence, it is possible to write down a “ﬁrst
principles” hydrodynamic theory for the motion of many bacteria [13,14] in which the re-
sponse coeﬃcients are measurable. Quantitative comparison between theory and experiment
is possible, and any discrepancies can be traced directly to the biochemistry of individual
bacteria [7]. The application to singularity formation arose from the recent discovery by
Budrene and Berg [5,6] of an assay in which E. coli excrete aspartate, an amino acid which
is also an attractant for nearby bacteria. Attractant diﬀusion drives aggregation because
it leads to an eﬀective force between individual bacteria: a higher density of bacteria in a
given region leads to a higher attractant concentration, which then attracts more bacteria.
The initial interest in the Budrene-Berg experiment was stimulated by the symmetrical
patterns that form when chemotactic bacteria are seeded in the center of a petri dish, as
shown in their papers [5,6].

Several theories have been developed for these patterns, most of which [15–20] view the
pattern formation as resulting from a linear instability of a (1 dimensional) travelling wave
of bacteria. Recently, it was pointed out [7] that each of the aggregates in a a pattern corre-
sponds to a density singularity in the hydrodynamic description of the bacteria. Therefore
the pattern formation depends crucially on the dynamics of singularity formation. Singu-
larities in chemotaxis were anticipated by Nanudjiah [21] and Childress and Percus [22] in
studies of mathematical models of chemotaxis. An important feature, understood ﬁrst by
Childress and Percus, is that chemotactic collapse has a critical dimension: although col-
lapse to an inﬁnite density sheet is mathematically impossible, collapse to inﬁnite density
lines and points both can occur. It was argued in [7] that these facts crucially aﬀect the

3

patterns that can form .

In particular, Figure 1 shows a step in the formation of the aggregates. The initially
diﬀuse band (ﬁlling the depth of agar) cannot form a singularity by collapsing only one of
its dimensions to zero thickness; instead it collapses into a cylinder (contracting two of its
dimensions simultaneously). The cylinder later destabilizes to form aggregates, for which all
three dimensions contract simultaneously. Models [15–20] viewing aggregate formation as the
linear instability of a band cannot account for these experimental observations. These two
diﬀerent pictures of aggregates form lead to diﬀerent conclusions about which biochemical
parameters set the wavelength and structure of the patterns. For the “collapsing cylinder”
mechanism advocated here, the characteristics of the pattern are set by the same biochemical
cutoﬀ which prevents an aggregate from reaching inﬁnite density.

Cylindrical collapse is also important when a uniform density cloud of bacteria breaks
into aggregates. Linear stability analysis of the uniform density state predicts that the cloud
directly breaks down into spherical aggregates. However, experiments [23] ﬁnd that the the
clumping is hierarchical: the uniform density cloud ﬁrst collapses as cylindrical structures
which then break into spherical aggregates. An important unsolved question is to explain
the geometry of the high density regions during collapse, and to predict the distribution of
ﬁnal aggregates.

In this paper, we use a combination of simulations and asymptotics to describe the
breakdown of a cylinder in of three principal steps (Figure 2). First, the bacteria collapse as
a cylinder towards a line of inﬁnite density. In the second step, uniformity along the cylinder
axis is broken, and a singularity develops at a single point. Finally, the remaining cylinder
breaks up producing a sequence of spherical aggregates. Our primary conclusion connecting
the present theory with the experiments is that the spacing between the aggregates in
patterns such as Figure 2 is determined by the local depletion of chemicals which make
aspartate production possible. According to Budrene [23], the most likely candidate for this
is the overhead oxygen concentration in the cell. This prediction is qualitatively in accord
with the experiments; moreover this parameter dependence could be directly tested in future
experiments, and would serve to discriminate this theory from those based on pure linear
stability analysis.

formed. Middle, the cylinder becomes modulated. Bottom, the modulated cylinder pinches oﬀ
and contracts, leaving a series of spherical aggregates. Note this sketch does not show the radial
contraction of the cylinder which takes place as it collapses.

In the following section, we review the basics of chemotaxis, and discuss details necessary
to understand the Budrene-Berg experiments. Section 2 describes the cylindrical collapse of
the bacteria. Cylindrical collapse (in which two dimensions of the cloud contract simulta-
neously) is a critical case [22,24], for which diﬀusion and attraction nearly exactly balance.
This criticality has complicated previous attempts to solve the collapse; a recent treatment
of collapse in the 2D nonlinear Schrodinger equation [25] inspired our solution. In Section
3 we perform a stability analysis of a collapsing cylinder. Perturbations to the cylinder can
be described by a “phase equation” for the singular time [26]. Solutions to this envelope
equation explain full numerical simulations of a modulated cylinder. Section 4 describes the
ﬁnal stage of the breakdown of the cylinder, after the cylinder has pinched oﬀ at a point.
Stability analysis predicts the breakup of the remaining column of bacteria, a situation anal-
ogous to a propagating Rayleigh instability in a liquid column [27]. Appendices describe our
numerical methods, and ﬁll in the details of the calculations.

I. PROBLEM FORMULATION: BACTERIAL CHEMOTAXIS

Chemotaxis refers to the migration of bacteria up chemical gradients. For Escherichia
coli, the basis of chemotaxis is largely understood [28,29]:
in the absence of a chemical
gradient, an E. coli bacterium performs a random walk [30]. When chemical gradients are
present, the bacterium’s internal biochemical reactions detect the gradients and couple to
the bacterial movement system. This sensing biases the random walk, and the bacterium has
a net drift towards a chemical attractant. Under special conditions, the bacteria can excrete
the chemoattractant aspartate [5,6] by converting carbon and nitrogen sources (succinate
and ammonia, respectively) in their environment. In these experiments no external chemical
gradients are present. Instead, each bacterium moves in response to the attractant produced
by other bacteria. Thus, the excretion of attractant produces a long-range force between
the bacteria, and induces complicated interactions in the colony.

The equations for the collective motion of the bacteria can be derived (with no free pa-
rameters) from the underlying biochemistry [14], allowing quantitative comparisons between
theory and experiments. The basic equations for the bacterial density ρ and the attractant
concentration c are

Here Db is the bacterial diﬀusion constant, k the chemotactic coeﬃcient, a the rate of bac-
terial division, α the rate of attractant production, and Dc the chemical diﬀusion constant.
The terms in equation 1 include the diﬀusion of bacteria, chemotactactic drift and division
of bacteria. Equation 2 expresses the diﬀusion and production of attractant.

Equations of this type were ﬁrst used to describe bacteria by Keller and Segal [31],
and, with variations, have been the subject of extensive investigations (see, e.g. [32,33]).
For E. coli, Schnitzer et. al. established the connection [13,14] between the time averaged
properties of the bacterial response and parameters in equations (1, 2). Thus, the exten-
sive studies of individual bacteria provide a rigorous justiﬁcation for the equations, as well
as measurements of the coeﬃcients. There is one complication to this statement that is
worthwhile to mention: in 1975 Spudich and Koshland [34] showed that E. coli have “non-
genetic individuality”, manifest in a distribution of tumble times (by about a factor of 2)
between genetically identical bacteria. The consequence of this is that both time-averaged
and ensemble-averaged properties of the bacteria are necessary to predict hydrodynamic
coeﬃcients; in addition, the dynamics must be such that the “distribution” of bacteria in
the ensemble does not change with time.

It is convenient to nondimensionalize equations (1, 2) by choosing a characteristic density
equal to the maximum initial density ρo. The characteristic scale of attractant is Db/k. The
density then determines the length scale and timescale according to H = DbDc/(αkρo) and
to = Dc/(αkρo). Typical numerical values are Db = 7x 10−6cm2/sec; Dc = 10−5cm2/sec;
k = 10−16cm5/sec; and α = 103/second/bacteria. For an experiment [7] which has ρo =
106/ cm3, the length scale is 260 microns and the timescale 100 seconds. The equations

where ǫ = Db/Dc and δ = ato. For the experiments shown in Figure 1, cells divide much
more slowly than the dynamics take place: the timescale for cell division is

II. CYLINDRICAL COLLAPSE

In this section we construct the solution for a uniformly collapsing cylinder of bacteria,
according to the evolution equations (3,4). Although the existence of cylindrical chemotactic
collapse is well known [24], the asymptotic solution describing the collapse has never been
constructed. Herrero and Velazquez [35] understood important features of two-dimensional
collapse and attempted to ﬁnd the solution; however, their solution is diﬀerent from what
we observe in numerical simulations (see Figure 4) and is therefore probably unstable.

The usual derivation of a similarity solution derives a set of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions from the scaling laws suggested by dimensional analysis. As shown below, the major
diﬃculty arises because in the present situation these ODEs have no solutions consistent
with the boundary conditions. This breakdown of “dimensional” scaling only occurs in
two-dimensional collapse. In higher dimensions, the scaling laws suggested by dimensional
analysis work ﬁne [36]. The overall structure of this problem is similar to critical collapse in
the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation [25], where the initial proposal for constructing
the asymptotic solution involved rather intricate mathematics (continuation as a function of
spatial dimension). Recently, a more physical derivation was put forward [25]. This work on
the nonlinear Schrodinger equation inspired our construction of the solution for chemotactic
collapse. Our central result is that the density singularity shows corrections to the dimen-
sional scaling laws. Deﬁning τ = t∗
t the distance to the singular time, the dimensional
scaling law is ρ = τ −1.
In the transient regime, we ﬁnd a slow power law correction to

Although the transient regime is present for 10 decades in the collapse time, we believe that
this log log law is the asymptotically correct blow up rate. A log log correction also appears
for 2D critical collapse in the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (See [25] and the references
therein).

A. Critical Dimension for Collapse

The competition between dissipation and collapse leads to a critical dimension. In this
problem, the critical dimension is 2, and one dimensional collapse—that is, collapse to a
planar structure with inﬁnite density—is forbidden.

We make qualitative arguments to explain the critical dimension by comparing the
chemotactic and diﬀusive ﬂuxes in a contracting structure. First, no singularities exist
for one-dimensional contraction. For a sheet of thickness ℓ the diﬀusive ﬂux is of order (see
equations (1, 2))

This equation is the Burgers’ equation; singular solutions to this equation do not exist [37].
In d = 2 and higher, density singularities can develop. In three dimensions, the nature
of the blowup is straightforward. The characteristic length scale (L) varies in time, and the
spatial structure is determined by the changes in L. A singularity corresponds to L
0.

Nevertheless, a similarity-type solution to the equations exists, as Figure 3 shows. The
density proﬁles at diﬀerent times (left) have been collapsed by rescaling the length scale
(right). This ﬁgure shows the basic features of the solution:
in the “inner” region, there
is a scaling solution. This matches onto an “outer” region far from the singularity, with a
ﬁnal “boundary” region where the boundary conditions must be satisﬁed. We illustrate this
section with plots from a single numerical simulation. The numerical method is described
in Appendix B; its most important feature is the remeshing, which moves mesh points every
time the maximum density increases by one percent to better resolve the singularity [38].

How do we reconcile the numerical (and experimental) observations of two-dimensional
collapse with the argument above that no solutions exist? We argue here that corrections
to the similarity solution arise to solve this problem. We ﬁnd in numerical simulations that
L−2 is preserved, the time dependence of L is

happens, and a slow timescale corresponding to changes in the similarity proﬁle. Working in
“similarity variables” allows a separation of these two timescales: we eliminate the known,
fast time dependence so we can analyze the slow evolution of the system.

(similarity) variables, an inner region expels any excess mass to approach M = 4. (Figure

1. Separation of Time Scales and Inner Solution

To ﬁnd the solution, we use techniques originally applied to a similar problem in the
2D nonlinear Schrodinger equation [25]. We ﬁrst deﬁne an important quantity: the collapse

We rewrite the similarity equation assuming that both quantities M and R depend on

the similarity variable η and (slowly) on time. The similarity equation is then

L2 ∂M

ηR = M ′.

Note that here the time derivative of M refers only to explicit time dependence of the mass;
the second term in the equation takes into account the time dependence slaved to the varying
length scale.

We can solve the similarity equation in the inner region. As the collapse proceeds, it
does indeed slow down. In fact, a numerical measurement of A (Figure 6) shows that the
collapse rate decreases by 3 orders of magnitude during the initial stages of the collapse. This
motivates us to look for a solution with A = 0; that is, a stationary solution (in similarity
variables). This stationary solution solves Equations (12,13) when A = 0 and ∂tM = 0. The
equation for the mass is then

(14)) by a factor of 4.

From the formula for Mo, we see an important feature of the stationary solution: the
total mass is 4 in dimensionless units. This reﬂects a rigorous result [24,36]: collapse will
occur if and only if the total mass per unit length of the cylinder satisﬁes M > 4. For
M < 4, no collapse is possible—the system evolves to constant density. For M > 4, collapse
occurs; however, numerical simulations show that the collapse converges toward a solution
with a collapsing mass precisely equal to four. In similarity variables, therefore, mass ﬂows
away from the origin.

Compare this expression for Ro to the numerical density proﬁles in Figure 3. The shape of
the proﬁle is accurately described by the formula for Ro, which conﬁrms that the stationary
8η−4,
solution holds in the inner region. At large η, the stationary solution has Ro ∼
cη−2. This “inner” solution to the equations
while the boundary conditions require R
∼
must therefore match onto an “outer” solution, as shown in Figure 3. How to analyze this
matching is the subject of the rest of this section.

Where does the crossover between inner and outer region occur? We can estimate the
location of the crossover by noting that the crossover between inner and outer solutions will
happen at some coordinate η∗, when AηM ′

2. Transient Regime

Near the beginning of the collapse, the singular (inner) part of the solution has formed,
but still strongly feels the inﬂuence of the boundary. During this initial, transient regime
in the dynamics, excess mass is expelled. At the end of the transient regime, the true
asymptotic state is reached. The transient regime is clear in the simulation shown here
10−10. Here we attempt to analyze the transient
(Figures 4, 6, 9), where it persists until τ
regime and consider how the system approaches the asymptotic regime. This analysis is
diﬃcult, because the transient dynamics depend on the initial and boundary conditions of
the system, and hence is particularly diﬃcult to characterize analytically.

Why even bother with the transient behavior? Because, as we mentioned above, the

transient regime persists until τ
before the true asymptotic dynamics are reached [39]. Therefore, all experiments can probe
only the transient regime. Furthermore, the detailed dynamics of the transient regime are
not highly sensitive to the initial conditions. We did a number of simulations in which the
length scale of the initial density distribution was varied (Figure 7). When the density is
initially almost constant, the time at which the singularity is reached, t∗, is large compared
to a simulation in which the density is initially peaked. However, the transient dynamics
are almost identical, regardless of whether the density is initially constant, or highly peaked
[40].

FIG. 7. Comparison of diﬀerent initial conditions. On the left, the time until the singularity
is reached depends logarithmically on the length scale of initial density variation, as expected for
an unstable collapsing mode. On the right, the transient regime dynamics are almost identical,
despite the wide range in length scale of perturbation. The legend shows the length scale of initial
density variation for each curve.

Our discussion of the transient regime that follows is incomplete and ad hoc.

It is,
however, the only self consistent explanation of numerical results we were able to ﬁnd. We
welcome additional, more conclusive work on this question.

We argue that the corrections to the length scale in the transient regime are faster than

logarithmic. Although theoretically we cannot rule out logarithms, we were not able to ﬁnd
an asymptotic solution for a correction which depended purely logaritmically in time that
explained all features of the numerical simulations. For this reason we believe that the most
consistent interpretation of the transient regime is that it actually breaks the scaling laws
predicted by dimensional analysis and introduces diﬀerent exponents.

Here we use features of the numerical solution to guide our construction of the transient
correction; this argument, while not entirely satisfactory, is at least consistent with all
the simulations. We seek corrections to dimensional scaling of power law form: that is,
√τ τ β and we are determining β. As long as β > 0 , we still have asymptotic validity
L
of the analysis, because A goes to 0. (Note that β depends on the initial and boundary
conditions, and is not universal.)

boundary. For earlier times, however, the ﬂattened region is not present: instead the forming
singularity connects directly to the outer “bump” where the excess mass has been pushed.

Once a true scale separation exists between the inner (collapsing) region and the bound-
ary, the matching is diﬀerent. Here we see slow (logarithmic) corrections in numerics, moti-
vating us to seek a logarithmic correction to the length scale. We deﬁne the slow time scale
log τ , and seek a length scale L of the form L = √τ /f (s). With this modiﬁcation,

The asymptotic solution for two-dimensional collapse is a very slow (log log τ ) correction to
the scaling laws from dimensional analysis. Our simulations cannot verify the functional
form of f ; however, we certainly see a crossover to slow (or nonexistent) corrections to
the length scale. In Figures 4,6, and 9, the slow correction is visible for τ between 10−20
and 10−10. A blow-up of this slow correction show that it is approximately constant, but
dominated by numerical noise—our numerics aren’t good enough to resolve this correction.
Note that a simple logarithmic correction (that is, f proportional to log τ ) is not consistent
with our simulation, because such a function would not be approximately constant over 10
orders of magnitude in time. Therefore, our numerics are consistent with, but not proof of,
a log log correction.

III. EVOLUTION OF A MODULATED CYLINDER

A collapsing cylinder eventually breaks into spherical aggregates. Here, we ﬁnd the
envelope equation which describes how modulations to the cylinder evolve. The challenge is
to describe a collapsing cylinder. Collapse ampliﬁes initially small perturbations; therefore
small variations along the cylinder (in density and the radial length scale) become large. We
can perform a valid perturbation analysis by studying variations in the singular time t∗.

In the original similarity solution, the singular time t∗ is undetermined:

if t∗ changes
by a constant, the solution remains valid. Allowing slow spatial variation in t∗ breaks this
symmetry. Therefore we expect the variation of t∗ to produce slow dynamics in space and
time. Because this mode is the most slowly decaying, it dominates the evolution of a cylinder.
We derive a phase equation, an approach used in many problems when stability is governed
by a slow mode associated with a broken symmetry [26]. Phase equations [43] were invented
to understand problems like convection, where the relevant symmetry is translation, and the
stability analysis is relative to a travelling wave solution.

We compare solutions of the phase equation to full numerics and show that the evolution

of a modulated, collapsing cylinder is well described by the simpliﬁed phase equation.

A. Derivation of a Phase Equation

This section gives a ﬂavor of the derivation of the phase equation, for details see Appendix
B. We seek an equation for the dynamics of τ (z, t) = t∗

the cylinder, R and C are no longer exact solutions to the equations (3, 4). We write the
correction as

where η = r/Lr, with the radial length scale Lr =
τ (z, t)/f (τ ), where f is the correction
to the length scale. The perturbation parameter δ is of order Lr/Lz, where Lz is the scale
q
of the density variation along the axis of the cylinder.

R = Ro(η) + δR1(η, z, t)
C = Co(η) + δC1(η, z, t)

18

We insert this guess into the original equations, and expand in δ. The lowest-order
equation gives the original similarity equations. At ﬁrst order, we ﬁnd an equation of the
form:

Λ(R1, C1) = F (Ro, Co)(τt + 1) + G(Ro, Co)τzz + H(Ro, Co)

(20)

τ 2

On the left side is a linear operator Λ acting on R1 and C1; Λ comes from the linearization
of the original equations. The right hand side contains derivatives of the singular time
multiplied by known functions of Ro and Co.

Although R1 and C1 are unknown, the right hand side is constrained by a solvability
condition: Any function which is annihilated by the adjoint of Λ must be orthogonal to the
right hand side. That is, if Λ†g = 0 for a nonzero g, then the inner product [44]

g, Λ(R1, C1)

=

Λ†g, (R1, C1)

Hence, the right hand side of (20) is orthogonal to g. In this case (see Appendix B) precisely
one nonzero g satisﬁes Λ† = 0. Taking the inner products leads to a phase equation of the
form

where the constants c1, c2, c3 can be expressed in terms of the known functions g, F , G, and
H:

The correction terms in this equation arise directly from the corresponding corrections to the
length scale in the similarity solution. In the subsequent section, we show that this results
in asymptotically diﬀerent scalings for the radial and axial length scales on the collapsing
cylinder. (Hence, a “point” singularitity that forms on a collapsing cylinder does not have
the same collapse rate as spherical collapse.) In the absence of corrections to dimensional
scaling, the phase equation is simply

B. Numerical Simulations of a Collapsing Cylinder

Now we compare solutions to equation (21) with a fully nonlinear simulation of a collaps-
ing cylinder. We have found two diﬀerent mechanisms by which modulations of the cylinder
can produce singularities: The ﬁrst is a “point” singularity, in which the density blows up
at a point on the cylinder; the second is a “travelling” singularity, which moves along the
cylinder axis with a diverging velocity (as the singularity is reached.)

The primary technical diﬃculty in simulating a collapsing cylinder is developing a
remeshing algorithm to closely approach the singularity. The meshing algorithm described
here resolves density singularities along the axis of the cylinder with essentially arbitrary
resolution. The algorithm is based on a simple one-dimensional scheme, which redistributes
mesh points every 50 timesteps to resolve the singularity. The two-dimensional algorithm
uses the one-dimensional remeshing scheme along both ˆr and ˆz simultaneously; the two
dimensional equations are then solved by operator splitting. Details of the algorithm are
summarized in Appendix A.

A typical simulation [45] started with a z-independent initial condition, which was al-
lowed to progress until the maximum density reached 104. At this point, the radial proﬁle
of the collapse was well approximated by the (2-dimensional) collapsing similarity solution
constructed in the previous section. We then added a z-dependent perturbation to the
density proﬁle, with amplitude much smaller than the ambient density.

The separation of scales hypothesis underlying the derivation of the phase equation is
maintained uniformly in time. We experimented with diﬀerent functional forms for the
density perturbations; as long as the length scale Lz for variation in the z direction is longer
than the variation in the radial direction Lr, perturbations tended to grow. In all cases, the
Lr was maintained. As demonstrated in Figure 10, a radial cross section of the
relation Lz ≫
cylinder always revealed density proﬁles in agreement with the two dimensional collapsing
singular solution constructed in the previous section.

cylinder. Note the r−4 region matched onto the r−2 region: The solution is well-described by the
two-dimensional similarity solution throughout the collapse (cf. Figure 3) even in the presence of
a z dependent modulation.

Extensive simulations have found two types of density singularities caused by modula-

tions to the cylinder.

1. Travelling Singularity

Travelling singularities occur when a step-like perturbation is placed on the cylinder,
increasing the density for z > z0 and decreasing the density for z < z0. The subsequent
evolution occurs at the boundary between these two regions. A simulation of this process
is shown in Figure 11. The higher density region propagates to the left. Heuristically, the
higher density region is beginning to contract as a sphere, so its decrease in size is consistent
with the beginnings of spherical collapse.

This propagating singularity can be described as a solution to the phase equation of the

form

where τo = t∗
time dependence is absorbed in φ and zo. Inserting into the phase equation (21), we have

Hence, the spatial extent of the high density region shrinks as the collapse is approached.

2. Point Singularity

Stationary singularities—in which the blow-up happens at a spatial point—occur in the
numerics for a wide variety of initial conditions. We believe that this represents the generic
evolution of a modulated cylinder.
Indeed, it is the end state of the travelling solution
just discussed, when the propagating wave runs into the reﬂection–symmetric boundary
condition. An instance of this solution is depicted in ﬁgure 13.

23

In contrast to the previous case, the corrections to dimensional scaling are important in
this solution. For our analysis, we take the point of blow-up to be at z = 0. Satisfying the
equation requires that the z length scale incorporate corrections to the scaling:

This shows that the generic density singularity that forms during the breakdown of cylin-
drical collapse, is not spherical collapse, but something milder. Locally, since the axial scale
Lz is much larger than the radial scale Lr the structure still looks like a cylinder. Numerical
evidence for this conclusion is evident in Fig 13, which shows that the singularity develops
a length scale in the axial direction which is much larger than the radial scale 1/√ρ. For
10−2. Our numerical algorithms
example, in Fig 13 when ρ = 1010 (so Lr = 10−5) then Lz ∼
have unfortunately not allowed us to ﬁnd the asymptotic Lz/Lr numerically; the problem is
that the separation of scales is so great between the radial and axial scales that one needs
many more mesh points than we can aﬀord to resolve the asymptotic regime.

IV. BREAKUP INTO SPHERICAL AGGREGATES

The question of relevance to the experiments is what happens next: Once blowup occurs
at a spatial point the cylinder has a “free end”, which changes the nature of the collapse.
We can no longer use the strategy of the previous section—perturbation about a collapsing
cylinder—because the radial structure is no longer closely approximated by the cylindrical
solution. The pinch-oﬀ drives the dynamics; speciﬁcally, the sharp end of the cylinder forms a
travelling wave. Heuristically, note that an edge of bacteria produces a higher concentration
of attractant where the density is higher. Thus the “tail” of bacteria moves toward higher
attractant density, and a travelling wave can form. Quantitatively, recall that for variation
in one spatial dimension the equations reduce to the Burgers’ equation, which has travelling
wave solutions [37]. The contraction of a cylinder end has been observed for the bacteria

24

[23], and the travelling waves have been discussed in other contexts [7]. Here we discuss the
instability of the recoiling end and the ﬁnal spacing of the spheres.

FIG. 14. Numerical simulation of a collapsing cylinder with a free end, showing contour plots of
the density. As the cylinder recoils, aggregates are left behind. The spacing between the aggregates
is determined by the density of the cylinder as it collapse. The ﬁnal frame in this ﬁgure shows the
density proﬁle along the centerline of the cylinder for the last contour plot (with 4 aggregates).
Note the maximum density is near the cutoﬀ density ρ∗ = 500 discussed in the text.

Figure 14 shows a set of numerical simulations of a retracting cylinder. The simulation
shows that the “end” of the cylinder collapses into a spherical aggregate, and simultaneously,
in front of the aggregate “waves” travel into the bulk of the cylinder. In the simulations,
the ends of the cylinder actually try to collapse to an aggregate of inﬁnite density. In order
to continue beyond this singularity and simulate the formation of an array of aggregates we
introduced a cutoﬀ which emulates the biochemistry in the actual experiment: when the
bacterial density becomes too high, the bacteria consume all the food sources (succinate
and oxygen) in their local environment and cease producing the attractant aspartate. We
modelled this by changing the equation for c to

∂c
∂t

= Dc∇

2c + αρ e−ρ/ρ∗

Here we have introduced ρ∗, the cutoﬀ bacterial density.
In [7] this cutoﬀ density was
estimated (assuming the cutoﬀ was caused by oxygen depletion) and shown to vary expo-
nentially with the overhead oxygen concentration in the cell: ρ∗
eCOx. For the simulation
shown in Figure 14 this cutoﬀ is ρ∗ = 500. Note that the density of the (undisturbed)
cylinder in front of the retracting rim slowly approaches the cutoﬀ density ρ∗; we have found
in simulations that the undisturbed cylinder always collapses to a density close to the cutoﬀ
value.

∼

The formation of the density wave occurs because the retracting end perturbs the cylinder
in front of it. We can ﬁnd the time-evolution of perturbations to the cylinder, requiring that
they decay away from the free end. The most unstable mode can be found using methods
of stationary phase(cf. [46]).

If the linear growth rate is ω(q) the point of stationary phase q∗ satisﬁes [46]

For the discussion here, we perform the calculation using the free space dispersion rela-

tion. A perturbation to constant density has the form

where we have taken ǫ = 1 for simplicity in this calculation. Plugging into the equations
and linearizing gives the dispersion relation:

These formulae demonstrate that the wavelength of the modulations are governed by the
undisturbed density in front of the rim. Since this density is asymptotically determined by
the cutoﬀ ρ∗, it follows that the wavelength of the ripples is determined by the cutoﬀ. The
characteristic distance between the aggregates is, therefore, determined by the cutoﬀ. This
conclusion can be experimentally tested.

The predictions for the wavelength and velocity of the front compare well with numerical
simulations. On decreasing ρ∗ from 500 to 140 the wavelength of the ripples increases from

≈

1.4 to 2.5, in qualitative agreement with the formulas.
We remark that the basic scenario outlined in this section was discovered by Elena
Budrene, in unpublished experiments: After observing the travelling band to collapse as a
cylinder (Fig. 1) Budrene observes fast “waves” propagating around the cylinder. Then,
a fragmentation front moves across the collapsing cylinder, leaving spherical aggregates
behind. The present theory predicts a scenario that is at least qualitatively very similar:
the fast “waves” correspond to the excitations of the cylinder from the phase equation (i.e.
the travelling steps, described in section 3). The fragmentation front occurs due to the
mechanism outlined in this section. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to make a
quantitative comparison of the experiments to the present theory, though such a comparison
would prove most interesting.

V. CONNECTION TO EXPERIMENTS

This paper has shown how the patterns formed by E. coli are connected to the geometry of
singularity formation in the hydrodynamic description of the bacteria. We have constructed
the solution for critical (two-dimensional) collapse, and developed a theory for modulations
to the cylinder. The phase equation provides a useful simpliﬁed description of a perturbed
cylinder. Ultimately, the spacing of spherical aggregates is determined by the instability of
a pinched cylinder of bacteria.

Here we compare our work to published experiments and suggest tests of the theory. Not
all the coeﬃcients in the original equations have been precisely measured [7] for the exper-
imental regime of interest. In particular, neither the attractant production rate α nor the
chemotactic coeﬃcient k have been measured for bacteria in the same chemical environment
as that of the collapse experiments. Thus, at this stage we can make only order of magnitude
numerical comparison with experiments. Here we use the values of the coeﬃcients for bac-
teria in a liquid medium [7]: bacterial diﬀusion coeﬃcient Db = 7x 10−6cm2/sec; attractant
diﬀusion coeﬃcient Db = 10−5cm2/sec [47]; chemotactic coeﬃcient k = 10−16cm5/sec; and
attractant production rate α = 103/second/bacteria

An important prediction of this theory is the critical mass of bacteria for cylindrical
collapse: assuming the above parameters, the formation of a collapsing cylinder requires a

27

minimum number of bacteria per unit length M = 4DbDc/(kα) = 3x103/cm. The existence
of a critical number of bacteria for cylindrical collapse has been inferred from experiments
[7], but this number has never been directly measured. We emphasize that (with precise
experimental measurements for the parameters Db, k and α) the theory rigorously and
precisely predicts this critical mass, allowing a direct test of the theory.

In this paper we have extensively discussed how to construct the correct description of two
dimensional collapse. In the experiments, the subtle corrections to the dimensional scaling
are probably not directly observable. However, the basic scaling relations expected from the
similarity solution—for example, that the maximum density is related to the length scale
L−2— could be measured in experiments, both for cylindrical
of density variations by ρm ∼
and spherical collapse. So far, no quantitative and controlled measurements of the bacterial
density have been performed.

In the section on cylindrical collapse, we discussed both the “transient” initial regime,
and the ﬁnal asymptotic regime which appears after true scale separation between the inner
and outer solution is achieved. In practice, we expect that the experiments probe only the
transient regime. The hard upper limit on bacterial density is when the bacteria are closely
packed; this corresponds to a density of 2x109/cm3. A typical initial density of bacteria
in the liquid experiments [7] is 106/cm3. The density increases by at most three orders of
magnitude during the collapse, in contrast with the ten orders of magnitude it takes to reach
the asymptotic regime in our simulations.

To our knowledge, modulations to a collapsing cylinder have never been quantitatively
measured in experiments (although as mentioned above, Budrene has made qualitative obser-
vations of this eﬀect). The travelling and point singularities that we predict for a modulated
cylinder may be observable. In particular, we predict that the radial and axial length scales
should be diﬀerent for the point singularity. Because the diﬀerence in these length scales
arises directly from the corrections in two-dimensional collapse, a measurement of these
length scales would test the validity of our derivation of the two-dimensional solution.

The modulated cylinder ultimately pinches oﬀ a point. We have argued that the spacing
of spherical aggregates is determined by the instability of a cylinder with an end. In practice,
when does the modulated cylinder pinch oﬀ (forming an end)? To answer this question, we
must know when our theory breaks down. Collapse to inﬁnite density cannot happen for
bacteria, because they have ﬁnite size. It was argued in [7] that even before the hard packing
density of bacteria is reached, oxygen depletion will stop bacterial collapse. Regardless of
the speciﬁc mechanism for stopping the collapse, at some time the highest density part of
the cylinder—the point singularity—will stop collapsing. This is the time of pinch oﬀ: the
point singularity evolves much more slowly than the neighboring, less dense regions of the
cylinder.

This argument about the point of pinch oﬀ gives a testable prediction of our model,

implies that the wavelength of the pattern should decrease exponentially with the oxygen
concentration; systematic experiments could test this prediction.

The one solid prediction that can be compared with present experiments is that there
is a lower bound on the aggregate spacing, that follows from the hard-packing density of
bacteria. Using the characteristic size 10µm of E. coli this is approximately 109/cm3. Thus
the measured aggregate spacing should always be above the lower bound

λmin = 0.1 mm,

where in this estimate we used the assumed values for the constants Db, k and α. This lower
bound agrees with experiments, in that the spacings are typically measured in millimeters.

APPENDIX A: REMARKS ON NUMERICAL METHODS

The partial diﬀerential equations described in this paper were solved using second order
in space, ﬁnite diﬀerence methods, supplemented with adaptive mesh reﬁnement. The time
discretization used a θ weighted Crank-Nicolson-type scheme (i.e. in the equation ˙f = Lf
the right hand side is evaluated at time (n + θ)∆t, where ∆t is the timestep). Typically,
in the simulations with one spatial dimension, θ = 0.6. For the simulations in two spatial
dimensions, we used an ADI operator splitting method, which requires using θ = 1. Because
these methods are implicit, at each timestep a matrix inversion was necessary. This is the
most expensive part of the numerical method.

The most subtle aspect of the numerical simulations reported in this paper is the mesh
reﬁnement. Without good mesh reﬁnement it is impossible to get close enough to the sin-
gularity to resolve the (logarithmic) corrects uncovered for the cylindrical collapse; without
good mesh reﬁnement in the two-dimensional simulations it would be impossible to acquire
enough decades of data to test the phase equation-theory presented in section 4. The mesh
reﬁnement was performed as follows:

One Spatial Dimension: The philosophy of mesh reﬁnement employed in this paper (ﬁrst
explained to us by Jens Eggers) is to frequently implement gradual changes in the mesh,
as opposed to infrequently implementing large changes. Mesh reﬁnement is implemented
every time the maximum density increases by one percent. During the reﬁnement, the
characteristic scale over which the solution varies is determined, and a mesh is constructed
to well reﬁne this scale; typically, this involves making sure there are about one hundred
mesh points across the region that the solution varies signiﬁcantly. The solution at the new
mesh is constructed by cubic spline interpolation of the old mesh. Because the mesh is

29

reﬁned frequently, the changes to the solution occurring during reﬁnement are small, and
there are no convergence diﬃculties after reﬁnement. The algorithm allows ﬁnding solutions
over essentially arbitrary changes in the bacterial density with as little as few hundred mesh
points. The simulations reported in the paper typically use a few thousand mesh points, in
order to accurately compute the slow approach to the log log scaling regime.

Two Spatial Dimensions: In two dimensions, the equations are solved using standard
operator splitting techniques. The mesh is rectangular, described by two functions, the x
coordinate xi and the y coordinate yj. Because the one dimensional algorithm described
above can achieve arbitrary resolution with a few hundred mesh points, it is possible to
well resolve density changes in both spatial directions using of order 104 mesh points. The
algorithm for these simulations works analogously to that for the one spatial dimension case
described above: Every ﬁfty time steps, the x grid (or y grid) is remeshed, in accordance with
the criterea outlined above. Typically we stagger the remeshing between the two directions
by twenty ﬁve timesteps.

Both the one and two dimensional codes were tested extensively by checking the solutions
against known analytical results. All of the results that are presented in this paper follow the
philosophy that numerical results are only believable if they can be replicated by asymptotic
solutions of the equations; in turn, asymptotic results are only useful if they show up in
numerics. For the two-dimensional code, one might worry that the operator splitting coupled
with the remeshing induces artiﬁcal biases in the numerics; besides checking our numerical
solutions against solutions to the phase equation, we have also tested the two dimensional
code by checking that it can reproduce the scalings and the similarity solution for spherically
symmetric collapse, where the solution is known very well.

[38] The simulation shown here used a box size W = 40 with a total mass of M = 12 and
ǫ = 10−5. For boundary conditions, we demanded reﬂection symmetry at the origin and
zero ﬂux at the outer boundary. Diﬀerent initial conditions give similar ﬁnal results;
here we used a Gaussian proﬁle.

[39] In principle, the transient regime can be eliminated or shortened by preparing the
system with mass very close to the critical mass M = 4. With less excess mass to expel,
the system approaches the asymptotic state more quickly. However, even in simulations
with M
4 the transient regime still persists for several decades. Since the density
can increase by at most three or for orders of magnitude in experiments, the transient
regime dominates the observed behavior.

scale of the density distribution was varied, between 5 and 1010, as shown in the Figure.

the transient regime are determined by matching to the boundary, the crossover time

time, and therefore the asymptotic regime is reached sooner.

[42] Note that the presence of the bump reﬂects the boundary conditions applied in the
simulation: we used no ﬂux boundary conditions. As an example of a diﬀerent boundary
condition, requiring constant density at the boundary means the bump will not be
present.

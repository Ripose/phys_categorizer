Abstract

Helix-coil transitions in poly-alanine molecules of length 10 are studied by
multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations. The solvation eﬀects are included
by either a distance-dependent dielectric permittivity or by a term that is
proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area of the peptide. We found a
strong dependence of the characteristics of the helix-coil transition from the
details of the solvation model.

simulations, solvation models

1 Introduction

There has been recently a renewed interest in the conditions under which α-helices,
a common structure in proteins, are formed or dissolved. It is long known that α-

helices undergo a sharp transition towards a random coil state when the temperature
is increased. The characteristics of this so-called helix-coil transition have been

studied extensively [1], most recently in Refs. [2, 3]. In Refs. [4, 5] evidence was
presented that the helix-coil transition in polyalanine exhibits a true thermodynamic

phase transition when interactions between all atoms in the molecule are taken into
account [4, 5].

The later results were obtained from gas-phase simulations of poly-alanine. While

there is some experimental evidence [6] supporting the numerical results of these gas-
phase simulations, the question remains how these results relate to the biologically

more relevant case of solvated molecules. First investigations of this question were
described in Refs.[7, 8] where it was claimed that the transition temperature is lower

in water than in vacuum. However, that investigation relies on a single represen-
tation of the protein-water interaction and the dependence of their results on the

details of the solvation term is not clear.

In this paper, we have investigated how the characteristics of helix-coil transition

change with the details of the solvation term. For this purpose, we have performed
multicanonical simulations of polyalanine molecules of length 10. The protein-water
interaction was included in two ways: either by a distance-dependent dielectric per-

mittivity or by a term that is proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area of
the peptide. For the later case we have considered four diﬀerent parameter sets:

OONS [9], JRF [10], W92 [11] and SCH [12]. Quantities such as the energy, helicity
and susceptibility were calculated as function of temperature. Our result were com-

pared with that of gas phase simulations. A strong dependence of the characteristics
of the helix-coil transition from the details of the solvation term was found.

2 Methods

Our investigation of the helix-coil transition for polyalanine is based on a detailed,
all-atom representation of that homopolymer. The interaction between the atoms

was described by a standard force ﬁeld, ECEPP/2,[13] (as implemented in the pro-
gram package SMMP [14]) and is given by:

Here, rij (in ˚A) is the distance between the atoms i and j, and χl is the l-th torsion
angle. We have chosen ECEPP/2 instead of the newer ECEPP/3 diﬀers because
this choice allows a more easy comparison with our previous work. Both force ﬁelds

diﬀer from each other only in the way in which prolines and end groups are treated.
In preliminary polyalanine simulations we found no qualitative diﬀerences in our

results when ECEPP/3 was used instead of ECEPP/2 (data not shown).

interactions in the presence of water rely on a distance dependent electrostatic per-
mittivity [15]:

For the parameters D and s empirical values are chosen such that for large distances
the permittivity takes the value of bulk water (ε ≈ 80), and the value ε = 2 for short
distances (protein interior space). Equation (6) is the result of interpolation of two
types of interactions. For short distances it models the interaction of two charges

placed in continuum medium, while over long distances it represents a Debye curve.
This is clearly a gross over-simpliﬁcation of protein-solvent interactions. However,

approximating solvation eﬀects by a distance-dependent dielectric permittivity was
used by many authors to study the proteins and nucleic acids (e.g.
[16]) since it
does not signiﬁcantly slow down protein simulations below that of simple in vacuo
simulations.

In another common approximation of the protein-solvent interaction one assumes
that the free energy contributions from atomic groups immersed in the protein in-

accepted [9, 11, 17, 18] that this free-energy diﬀerence is proportional to the surface
area of the atomic group which is exposed to the solvent. Within this approxima-

tion, the total solvation energy of a protein is given by the sum of contributions
from each solvated atomic groups:

Esol =

σiAi,

(7)

Xi
where Esol is the solvation energy, Ai is the conformational dependent solvent acces-
sible area of the surface of the i − th atom and σi is the atomic solvation parameter
for the atom i. The summation is extended over all atomic groups. The solvation
parameters are evaluated experimentally by measuring the free energy needed to

bring the group from a nonpolar environment (usually octanol or ethanol are used
as convenient compounds) into water. Many sets of solvation parameters were eval-

uated by several authors with diﬀerent methods, but unfortunately it is not always
obvious which one is the most appropriate one. The sets we study here are named by
us OONS [9], JRF [10], W92 [11] and SCH [12], and are described in the respective

references.

Simulations of detailed models of biological macromolecules are notoriously dif-
ﬁcult. This is because the various competing interactions within the polymer lead

to an energy landscape characterized by a multitude of local minima. Hence, in
the low-temperature region, canonical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simu-

lations will tend to get trapped in one of these minima and the simulation will
not thermalize within the available CPU time. Only recently, with the introduc-
tion of new and sophisticated algorithms such as multicanonical sampling [19] and
other generalized-ensemble techniques [20] was it possible to alleviate this problem
in protein simulations [21]. For polyalanine, both the failure of standard Monte

Carlo techniques and the superior performance of the multicanonical algorithm are
extensively documented in earlier work [22]. For this reason, we use again this

sophisticated simulation technique for our project.

In the multicanonical algorithm [19] conformations with energy E are assigned
a weight wmu(E) ∝ 1/n(E). Here, n(E) is the density of states. A simulation with
this weight will lead to a uniform distribution of energy:

Pmu(E) ∝ n(E) wmu(E) = const .

(8)

This is because the simulation generates a 1D random walk in the energy space,
allowing itself to escape from any local minimum. Since a large range of energies are

sampled, one can use the reweighting techniques [23] to calculate thermodynamic
quantities over a wide range of temperatures T by

< A >T =

dx A(x) w−1(E(x)) e−βE(x)
dx w−1(E(x)) e−βE(x)

,

R

where x stands for conﬁgurations.

R

Unlike in the case of canonical simulations the weights

w(E) = n−1(E) = e−S(E)

are not a priori known. Instead estimators for these weights have to be determined.
This is often done by an iterative procedure in which for reasons of numerical sta-

bility Eq. 10 is replaced by

w(E) = e−β(E)E−α(E) .

The multicanonical parameters β(E) and α(E) are deﬁned through

β(E) =

S(E′) − S(E)
E′ − E

and α(E) =

0
α(E′) + (β(E′) − β(E))E′

(

, E < Emax

with E and E′ adjacent bins in the array S(E). The β(E) are then iteratively
updated [24] by the relation

βi+1(E) = βi(E) + g0(E) ·

ln H i(E′) − ln H i(E)

/(E′ − E) ,

(13)

in which H i(E) is the histogram of the i-th run (and H(E) ≥ 1). In Ref. [24] the
factor g0(E) in Eq. 13 was deﬁned through

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

g0(E) =

ˆgi(E) +

ˆgj(E)

with ˆgi(E) =

H i(E′) · H i(E)
H i(E′) + H i(E)

.

(14)

ˆgi(E)
i−1
j

P

The above relation assumes that the histogram H(E) counts independent events
which is in general not true. Hence, it is more appropriate and leads to a faster
convergence of β(E) if the array ˆgi(E) in Eq. 14 is instead deﬁned by

ˆgi(E) =

K i(E′)K i(E)
K i(E′) + K i(E)

(15)

where the auxiliary array K(E) now counts only the number of independent visits
at energy E.

With the above described iterative procedure we needed 200,000 sweeps for the
weight factor calculations. All thermodynamic quantities were then estimated from

one production run of 1, 000, 000 Monte Carlo sweeps starting from a random initial
conformation, i.e. without introducing any bias.

3 Results and Discussion

In previous gas-phase simulations of poly-alanine [3, 4, 5, 22] we observed at T =

430 K a pronounced transition between a high-temperature phase dominated by dis-
ordered coil structures and an ordered phase with single, extended helices. A natural
order parameter for this helix-coil transition is the average number < nH(T ) > of
residues in the oligomer which are part of an α−helix. Following earlier work [22]
we deﬁne a residue as helical if the pair of backbone dihedral angles φ, ψ takes a
value in the range (−70 ± 20, −37 ± 20). In Fig. 1a this order parameter is displayed
as function of temperature for a gas-phase simulation (GP) of Ala10 and simulations
with the various solvation terms. Fig. 1b shows the corresponding plots for the
susceptibility χ(T ) deﬁned by

χ(T ) =< n2

H (T ) > − < nH (T ) >2

.

In Fig. 1a and 1b the curves, representing the various simulations, fall into
three groups. For the case where the protein-solvent interaction was approximated
by a distance-dependent permittivity (DDE), both < nH > and χ have a similar
temperature dependence than is observed for poly-alanine in gas-phase simulations
(GP). However, the transition temperature Tc is shifted from T = 435 ± 20 K (gas-
phase) to a higher value T = 495 ± 20. This temperature was determined from the
maximum of the susceptibility χ(T ) in Fig. 1b and is listed in table 1. To the same

group belong the simulations in which the solvation energy was approximated by
a solvent accessible surface term with either the OONS [9] or SCH [12] parameter
In both cases susceptibility χ and order parameter < nH(T ) > show also a
set.
temperature dependence similar to the one of gas-phase simulations. Only now,
the transition temperature Tc is shifted to lower temperatures. The corresponding
transition temperatures can be again determined from the positions of the maximum
in χ(T ) and are also listed in table 1. The shift towards lower temperatures was one

of the main results reported in Refs. [7, 8] for simulations with the OONS solvation
energy, and our Tc = 345 ± 20 K agrees well with their value Tc = 340 K (no errors
quoted) in Refs. [7, 8].

A somehow diﬀerent behavior is observed in the simulation where the protein-

water interaction was approximated by a solvent accessible surface term relying on
the W92 [11] parameter set. Here, the form of < nH > indicates only partial helix
formation and occurs only at much lower temperatures. The susceptibility χ(T ) in
Fig. 1b gives no indication for a helix-coil transition. For this reason no value of Tc
is listed for the W92 parameter set in table 1. Instead, we observe in Fig. 2 for this

case at low temperatures even the appearance of residues whose backbone dihedral
angles φ, ψ take values typical for a β-sheet (−150 ± 30, 150 ± 30).

Yet another behavior is observed in simulations where the solvation energy of
Eq. 7 is evaluated by means of the JRF parameter set. No formation of helices

or sheets is observed in Figs. 1 and 2. Since no transition temperature can be
determined, we do not list a value of Tc for the JRF parameter set in table 1.

The same grouping can be found in Fig. 3a-f where we display various energy

terms as a function of temperature. In these ﬁgures we have shifted the solvation
energies and the partial ECEPP/2 energies EC, ELJ, EHB and Etor of Eq. 5 by a
constant term such that we have for all solvation models at T = 1000 K Esol = 0 and
EC = ELJ = EHB = Etor = 0. Such a shift by an irrelevant constant allows a better
comparison of the diﬀerent simulations. The average total energy < Etot > which

6

is the sum of intramolecular potential energy EECEEP/2 and the solvation energy
Esol, is displayed in Fig. 3a. We observe again that simulations with the parameters
sets OONS and SCH, and such with distant dependent permittivity (DDE), have
a similar temperature dependence as gas phase simulations (GP). On the other

hand, in simulations relying on the W92 parameter set, the energy varies less with
temperature and is at low temperatures considerably higher than in the simulations
with other solvation energy terms. Finally, the energy in simulations with the JRF

parameter set is an almost linear function of temperature and is especially at high
temperatures much lower than the energies found in gas phase simulations.

The dissimilar behavior of energy for simulations with diﬀerent solvation terms
is even more obvious in Fig. 3b where the average intramolecular energy EECEP P/2
is drawn. While this energy term decreases between 1000 K and 150 K by ≈ 50
Kcal/mol (with most of that change, ≈ 30 Kcal/mol, happing around the respective
transition temperature Tc) in gas-phase simulations (GP) and in simulations with
OONS, SCH and DDE solvation terms, it changes in the same temperature interval
only by ≈ 20 Kcal/mol in simulations utilizing the JRF or W92 parameter sets.
Since for these two parameter sets also no or only little helix formation was observed
it seems likely that the formation of helices is related to the large gain in potential

energy observed for GP, OONS,SCH and DDE simulations. This gain in potential
energy is in part due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between a residue and

the fourth following one in the polypeptide chain which stabilize an α-helix. Fig. 3c
displays the average hydrogen-bonding energy < EHB > of Eq. 5 as a function of
temperature and one can clearly see the gain in energy for the GP, DDE, OONS and

SCH simulations at the respective helix-coil transition temperatures of table 1. No
such gain is observed in W92 and JRF simulations where also no helix formation was

found. A similar gain in energy with helix formations in gas-phase and simulations
with DDE,OONS and SCH solvent representations is also observed for the average
Lennard-Jones energy < ELJ > and the electrostatic energy < EC > displayed in
Fig. 3d and 3e, respectively. Note also in Fig. 3e the large gain in EC for DDE at
the helix-coil transition temperature which additionally stabilizes the α-helix in this

model.

A complementary picture is found in Fig. 3f where the solvation energy Esol
is shown as a function of temperature. The observed helix formation in gas phase
simulations and such with OONS,SCH and DDE solvent representations is correlated
with an increases of the solvation energies by ≈ 5 Kcal/mol. On the other hand,

7

in simulations with the W92 and JRF parameter sets, for which no helix-formation
was observed in Fig. 1, Esol decreases with temperature. This decrease is only ≈ 5
kcal/mol for W92, but it is much larger (of order 30 kcal/mol) in the case of JRF
where the solvation energy is the dominant term.

The eﬀects of the dominant solvation term in simulations with the JRF parameter
set can also be seen in Fig. 4. In this ﬁgure the average radius of gyration, a measure
for the compactness of conﬁgurations, is shown as a function temperature. One can

see that this quantity changes little with temperature for the JRF data. However,
its value is over the whole temperature range considerably smaller than observed in

the other simulations. This indicates that the JRF solvation term favors already at
high temperatures compact conﬁgurations, and that the pressure towards compact

structure is such that the more elongated helices cannot be formed. Note however,
that the tendency towards compact conﬁgurations does not lead to a lower Lennard-
Jones energy ELJ as one would expect. Fig. 3d indicates that < ELJ > is at low
temperatures in JRF simulations even larger than in GP, DDE, OONS and SCG
simulations where helix-formation was observed. The tendency towards compact

structures in JRF simulations may be due to the fact that JRF parameter set was
compact) conformations of peptides (the
developed from minimum energy (i.e.

low-energy conformations of 13 tetrapeptides derived by NMR studies [10]), and
therefore this parameter set may have an intrinsic bias towards compact structures.

On the other hand, the W92 parameter set was developed from measurements of
free energies of amino acid side chain analogs from vapor to water [26]. The param-
eters for this set are negative for all atoms except carbon meaning that the nitrogen,

oxygen and sulfur atoms are considered hydrophilic, i.e. favoring solvent exposure.
This explains not only the small solvation energies observed for this parameter set

in Fig. 3f, but also why in Fig. 4 the radius of gyration is consistently larger for
this parameter set than for the others indicating that extended conﬁgurations are

favored with this parameter set. This bias towards extended structures limits again
the formation of α-helices.

While the OONS parameter set was derived from experimental free energies of

gas-to-water transfer of small aliphatic and aromatic molecules, the SCH is not
directly based on experimental free energy data. Instead, it was developed as an

optimized parameter set to complement the CHARMM force ﬁeld [25].
In both
parameter sets the hydrophobic character of the carbon atoms is increased and the

hydrophilic character of uncharge oxygen and nitrogen atoms decreased resulting

8

into the large solvation energies of these two parameter sets (when compared with
the one of the W92 parameter set) that one observes in Fig. 3f. The OONS and SCH

solvation energies again favor extended structures (the radius of gyration has larger
values than found in gas-phase simulations), however, the interplay of solvation

energies and intramolecular ECEPP/2 energy is such that the radius of gyrations
(and consequently the compactness) of polyalanine conﬁgurations as a function of
temperature shows a similar behavior as the gas-phase simulation. The same is true

for the DDE simulation where the protein-solvent interaction was approximated by
a distance-dependent permittivity.

Our results demonstrate that the helix formation is due to the gain in poten-
tial (intramolecular) energy while (with the exception of the JRF parameter set)

the solvent-accessible surface terms favor extended peptide conﬁgurations. Table 2
summarizes the diﬀerences in total energy ∆Etot , solvation energy ∆Esol, poten-
tial energy ∆EECEEP/2, and the partial energies ∆EC, ∆ELJ , ∆EHB and ∆Etor
between complete helical conﬁgurations (all residues with exception of the terminal
ones are part of an α-helix) and coil conﬁgurations at temperature T = 300 K for

gas-phase, DDE OONS and SCH simulations. Note, that the intramolecular energy
diﬀerences ∆EECEP P/2 of gas-phase, OONS and SCH simulations have within their
error bars the same values. For simulations with the W92 parameter set the longest
found helix consists of 6 consecutive residues. Hence, we measured for this case only

the energy diﬀerence between conﬁgurations with at least three consecutive helical
residues (i.e. one turn of an α-helix) and coil conﬁgurations. This modiﬁed deﬁni-
tion of the energy diﬀerences is also the reason for the smaller value of ∆EECEP P/2
listed for W92 in table 2. We do not list energy diﬀerences for the JRF parameter
set since no helices were found in simulations utilizing this parameter set.

Note that in simulations with distant dependent permittivity (DDE) helices are
energetically more favored than in the gas-phase simulations. This is due to the
increased contribution from the Coulomb term EC as one can also see in Fig. 3e.
The larger energy gap between helical and coil conformations (when compared with
gas-phase simulations) explains why the transition temperature is higher in DDE

simulations than in gas-phase simulations.

For the OONS and the SCH parameter set the solvation energy diﬀerence ∆Esol is
positive (indicating that coil structures are energetically favored), but its magnitude
is only approximately half that of the potential energy diﬀerence ∆EECEP P/2. Hence,
there is still an overall energetic gain connected with helix formation. However,

9

in both cases the total energy diﬀerence between helical and coil conﬁgurations is
reduced by the solvation energy when compared with the gas-phase simulation. This

reduction of the energy gap leads to the lower transition temperatures observed in
OONS and SCH simulations.

On the other hand, for the W92 parameter set we ﬁnd that ∆EECCP/2 and
∆Esol are of same magnitude so that helical conﬁgurations are not or only weakly
energetically favored. This is consistent with our results in Fig. 1a and 1b where

we ﬁnd at T = 280 K a high average helicity in OONS and SCH simulations but
only a small value of < nH > and no indications for a helix-coil transition in W92
simulations. An evaluation of energy diﬀerences was not possible for simulations
with the JRF parameter set since no helices were found.

The above results indicate that the existence and characteristics of the helix-coil
transition in polyalanine depend strong on the details of the solvent representation.
In order to evaluate the validity of the diﬀerent solvent models one has to compare

the numerical results with experimental data. For this purpose we have calculated
the helix propagation parameter s which was also determined by experiments [28,

29]. According to the Zimm-Bragg model [27] the average number of helical residues
< n > and the average length < ℓ > of a helical segment are given for large number

of residues N by

where s is the helix propagation parameter and σ the nucleation parameter of the

Zimm-Bragg model. From these equations with the values of < n >/N and < ℓ >
calculated from the multicanonical production runs, we have calculated s at tem-

perature T = 280 K for gas-phase and the diﬀerent solvation models. Our values are
summarized in table 3 which also lists our σ values. Our results for gas-phase, DDE

and OONS simulations are in agreement with the experimental results of Ref. [29]
where they list values of s(Ala) between 1.5 and 2.19. On the other hand, the s

value obtained in the SCH simulation agrees well with the one obtained by the host-
guest technique of Ref. [28]. However, the s values which were obtained in W92 or
JRF simulations do not agree with either of the experimental data. Hence, we con-

clude that the W92 and JRF parameter sets are not appropriate solvation models
in simulations of polyalanine. Otherwise, the variation in the experimental data is

10

too large to give indications whether one of the remaining solvent representations
(DDE, OONS, SCH or even no solvent at all (GP)) is preferable over the others.

4 Conclusions

We have performed multicanonical simulations of polyalanine. The intramolecular

forces were modeled by the ECEPP/2 force ﬁeld and various approximations for the
solvation energy were studied. We observed that whether a helix-coil transition is
observed for poly-alanine, and at what temperature, depends strongly on the chosen

approximation for the protein-solvent interaction. Our results demonstrate both the
importance (and need) of including solvation terms into protein simulations and the

diﬃculties in chosing an adequate representation of the protein-water interactions.
Especially when using the solvent-accessible surface approach, it seems necessary to

carefully choose a parameter set that is suitable for the problem under consideration.
Use of a speciﬁc parameter set without further justiﬁcation could otherwise generate
miss-leading results.

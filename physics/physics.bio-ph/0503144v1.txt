Abstract

Thermodynamic perturbation theory is applied to the model of globular proteins studied by

ten Wolde and Frenkel (Science 277, pg. 1976) using computer simulation. It is found that the

reported phase diagrams are accurately reproduced. The calculations show how the phase diagram

can be tuned as a function of the lengthscale of the potential.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most important problems in biophysics is the characterization of the struc-

ture of proteins. The experimental determination of protein structure by means of x-ray

diﬀraction requires that the proteins be prepared as good quality crystals which turns out

to be diﬃcult to achieve. Given the fact that recent years have seen an explosion in the

number of proteins which have been isolated, the need is therefore greater than ever for

eﬃcient methods to produce such crystals. Without ﬁnely tuned experimental conditions,

often discovered through laborious trial and error, crystallization may not occur on labo-

ratory time-scales or amorphous, rather than crystalline, structures may form. The recent

observation by ten Wolde and Frenkel[1] of enhanced nucleation of a model protein in the

vicinity of a metastable critical point is thus of great interest and could lead to more eﬃcient

means of crystallization if such conditions can be easily identiﬁed for a given protein.

Wilson noted that favorable conditions for crystallization are correlated with the behavior

of the osmotic second virial coeﬃcient[2] and, hence, depend sensitively on temperature. If

the second virial coeﬃcient is too large, crystallization occurs slowly and if it is too small,

amorphous solids form. By comparing the experimentally determined precipitation bound-

aries for several diﬀerent globular proteins as a function of interaction range, controlled

by means of the background ionic strength, Rosenbaum et al have shown that the phase

diagrams of a large class of globular proteins can be mapped onto those of simple ﬂuids

interacting via central force potentials consisting of hard cores and short-ranged attractive

tails[3],[4]. They also discuss the important fact that the range of interaction can be tuned

by varying the composition of the solvents used. The attraction must, in general, be very

short ranged if this model is to apply since a ﬂuid-ﬂuid phase transition is not typically

observe experimentally[4] and it is known that this transition is only suppressed in simple

ﬂuids when the attractions are very short ranged[5]. These studies therefore support the

conclusion that the study of simple ﬂuids interacting via potentials with short-ranged attrac-

tive tails can give insight into nucleation of the crystalline phase of a large class of globular

proteins.

ten Wolde and Frenkel have studied nucleation of a particular model globular

protein consisting of a hard-core and a modiﬁed Lennard-Jones tail by direct free energy

measurements obtained from computer simulations[1]. They found that the nucleation rate

of a stable FCC solid phase could be signiﬁcantly enhanced in the vicinity of a metastable

2

critical point. The enhancement is due to the possibility that a density ﬂuctuation in the

vapor phase is able to ﬁrst nucleate a metastable droplet of denser ﬂuid which, in turn,

forms a crystal nucleus. The fact that intermediate metastable states can accelerate barrier

crossing has been conﬁrmed using kinetic models[6] and the physics of the proposed non-

classical nucleation model has also been conﬁrmed by theoretical studies based on density

functional models[7],[8]. This observation opens up the possibility of eﬃciently producing

good quality protein crystals provided that it is understood how to tune the interactions

governing a given protein so that its phase diagram possesses such a metastable state under

experimentally accessible conditions. A prerequisite for achieving this is to go beyond the

heavily parameterized studies conducted so far and to be able to accurately predict phase

diagrams given knowledge of the range of the protein interactions. In this paper, we describe

the application of thermodynamic perturbation theory to calculate the phase diagram based

solely on the interaction model. In so far as the range of interaction is important, and not

the detailed functional forms, this approach, if successful, gives a direct connection between

the phase diagram and the range of interaction without the need for further, phenomenolog-

ical parameterizations. We show that the theory can be used to successfully reproduce the

phase diagrams of ten Wolde and Frenkel based only on the interaction potential and assess

the eﬀect of the range of the interatomic potential on the structure of the phase diagram.

In the next Section, the formalism used in our calculations is outlined. This involves the

standard Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory with modiﬁcations to improve its

accuracy at high densities. The third Section discusses the application of the perturbation

theory to the ten Wolde-Frenkel interaction model. Whether or not perturbation theory

is applicable to this type of system is not immediately evident: the hard-core square well

potential has long served as a test case for developments in perturbation theory[9]. So we

show how the size of the various contributions to the total free energy varies with temperature

and that second order contributions to the free energy are of negligible importance. In the

fourth Section, the calculated phase diagram for the hard core plus modiﬁed Lennard-Jones

tail is shown to be in good agreement with the reported Monte Carlo (MC) results. Since

the perturbation theory is also well known[10] to give a good description of long-ranged

potentials such as the standard Lennard-Jones, we expect that it can be used with some

conﬁdence to explore the eﬀect of the length scale of the potential on the phase behavior

of the systems. To illustrate, we present the phase diagram as a function of the range

3

of the modiﬁed Lennard-Jones tail and show that the appearance of the metastable state

requires only a minor modiﬁcation of the range of the potential. The ﬁnal Section contains

our conclusions where we discuss the prospect for using the perturbation theory free energy

function as the basis for density functional studies of the nucleation process and for studies

of the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations on the nucleation rate.

II. THERMODYNAMIC PERTURBATION THEORY

Thermodynamic perturbation theory allows one to express the Helmholtz free energy F

of a system in terms of a perturbative expansion about some reference system. There are

a number of diﬀerent approaches to constructing the perturbative expansions such as the

well known Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA)[11],[12],[13],[14] theory and the more recent

Mansoori-Canﬁeld/Rasaiah-Stell theory[15]. The latter appears to be more accurate for

systems with soft repulsions at small separations while the former works better for systems

with stronger repulsions. Here, we will be interested in a hard-core potential with a modiﬁed

Lennard-Jones tail, so we use the WCA theory as modiﬁed by Ree and coworkers[16],[10],[17]

as discussed below. The ﬁrst step is to divide the potential into a (mostly) repulsive short-

ranged part and a longer ranged (mostly) attractive tail according to the prescription

v(r) = v0 (r) + w (r)

(1)

v (r)

−

v (r) , r > r0

.

v0 (r) = 



w (r) = 




The short ranged part is generally repulsive and can therefore be well approximated by a

hard-sphere reference system. The long-ranged tail describes the attractive forces and must

also be accounted for so that distinct liquid and gas phases exist (i.e. so that the phase

diagram exhibits a Van der Waals loop). There are a number of versions of the WCA-

type perturbation theory depending on the choice of the separation point r0. Barker and

Henderson[18] chose the separation point r0 to be the point at which the potential goes

to zero, v (r0) = 0, (they also did not include the linear term in the expressions above).

Subsequently, WCA achieved a better description of the Lennard-Jones phase diagram by

4

taking the separation point to be at the minimum of the potential, v′ (r0) = 0 . Ree[16] ﬁrst

suggested that the free energy be minimized with respect to r0, and introduced the linear

terms in eq.(1), in which case the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory is equivalent to a variational

theory based on the Gibbs-Bugolyubov inequalities[14]. Later, Ree and coworkers showed

that essentially the same results could be achieved with the prescription

r0 = min (rmin, rnn)

(2)

where rmin is the minimum of the potential, v′ (rmin) = 0 and rnn = 2

1

6 ρ−1/3, where ρ is

the density, is the FCC nearest-neighbor distance[10]. For low densities, this amounts to

the original WCA prescription whereas for higher densities, the separation point decreases

with increasing density.

In this case, the linear term in the deﬁnition of v0 (r) ensures

the continuity of the ﬁrst derivative of the potential. Calculations for the Lennard-Jones

potential, as well as inverse power potentials, show that this modiﬁcation of the original

WCA theory gives improved results at high density. Finally, eq.(2) was modiﬁed to switch

smoothly from rmin to rnn as the density increases so as to avoid discontinuities in the free

energy as a function of density and thus singularities in the pressure[17]. Below, we will

refer to this ﬁnal form of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen-Ree theory as the WCAR theory.

A. Contribution of the long-ranged part or the potential

B. Contribution of the short-ranged part of the potential

The description of the reference system is again accomplished by perturbation theory.

Since the potential v0 (r) is not very diﬀerent from a hard core potential, this perturbation

theory does not involve the high temperature expansion but, rather, involves a functional

expansion in the quantity exp (

the pair distribution function. Then, the complete expression for the free energy becomes

C. Description of the reference liquid

The calculation of liquid phase free energies require as input the properties of the hard

sphere liquid. These are known to a high degree of accuracy and introduce no signiﬁcant

uncertainty, nor any new parameters, into the calculations.

The properties of low density hard-sphere liquids are well described by the Percus-Yevick

(PY) approximation but this is not adequate for the dense liquids to be considered here. So

for the hard sphere cavity function, we have used the model of Henderson and Grundke[20]

which modiﬁes the PY description so as to more accurately describe dense liquids. The

corresponding pair distribution function is then that of Verlet and Weiss[21] and the equation

of state, as obtained from it by both the compressibility equation and the pressure equation,

is the Carnahan-Starling equation of state[14]. The free energy as a function of density

follows immediately and is given by

(cid:16)
where η = ρd3. The second term of eq.(12) is easily evaluated numerically as its kernel is

where the ﬁrst piece can be calculated analytically and the second involves the structure

function ghs (r)

1 which is relatively short ranged allowing a numerical evaluation. However,

at high densities this can still be diﬃcult to evaluate as the hard-sphere structure extends for

considerable distances. In the Appendix, we discuss a more eﬃcient method of evaluation

based on Laplace transform techniques. We have used both methods and obtained consistent

results: in general, the second is much easier to implement and numerically more stable.

D. Description of the reference solid

To calculate the properties of the solid phase, the same expressions are used except that

the reference free energy is now that of the hard-sphere solid and the pair distribution

function is the spherical average of the hard-sphere pair distribution function. Both of these

quantities can be obtained by means of classical density functional theory, but here we

choose the simpler, and older, approach which makes use of analytic ﬁts to the results of

computer simulations together with the known high-density limit of the equation of state.

This limits the present calculations to the investigation of the FCC solid phase as this is

the only one for which extensive simulations have been performed. We stress that these ﬁts

are very good and that they introduce no new parameters into the calculations of the phase

In the calculations presented below, we have used the equation of state proposed by

diagrams.

and the parameters w1, w2 and w are given as functions of density by analytic ﬁts to the

MC data[24]. No such ﬁt is given for the parameter x1 so its value must be determined by

interpolating from the values extracted from the MC data as given in [24]. The quantities

ni and xi are the number of neighbors and the position of the i-th lattice shell respectively.

Note that Ree et al suggest using the earlier parameterization of Weis[25] at lower densities,

where it is slightly more accurate, and the Kincaid-Weis version at higher densities. We have

not done this because it leads to discontinuities in the free energy as a function of density

at the point the switch is made. Since these are just empirical ﬁts, we do not believe there

is a signiﬁcant loss of accuracy.

III. APPLICATION TO A MODEL PROTEIN INTERMOLECULAR POTEN-

TIAL

A. The potential

The only input needed for the perturbative calculation outlined in Section II is the in-

termolecular potential: there are no phenomenological parameters to specify. The goal of

this work is to show how to construct a realistic free energy functional with which to study

nucleation of protein crystallization using the model potential of ten Wolde and Frenkel[1].

As such, the potential decays as a power law and is not short-ranged in the usual sense.

which approaches the hard core for large α . Furthermore, for a ﬁxed position r > rmin, the

value of the potential decreases with increasing α relative to its minimum. For example,

so that as α increases, the interactions of particles separated by much more than rmin con-

tribute less and less to the total energy compared to the contribution of particles that are

close together. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the shape of the potential as α increases.

The range of the potential varies from about 2.5 hard sphere diameters for α = 1 to less

than 1.25 diameters for α = 50. Also shown in the ﬁgure is the separation of the potential

into long- and short-ranged pieces for the case α = 50 where it is clear that even for this very

short-ranged potential, the long-ranged function W (r) varies relatively slowly compared to

the short-ranged repulsive potential V0 (r).

B. Comparison of various approximations

Figure 2 shows the contributions of the various terms contributing to the free energy

at two temperatures. In both cases, the second order term is seen to be negligible. This

is because at low density, the free energy is dominated by the ideal-gas contribution, all

other contributions going to zero with the density, whereas at moderate to high density, the

compressibility controlling the size of the contribution of the second order term, see eq.(12),

diminishes quickly from its zero density limit of 1.0 to something on the order of 0.1 at

moderate densities and is of order 0.01 at high densities. We conclude that the second order

contributions, at least calculated within the macroscopic compressibility approximation,

eq.(6), can be neglected.

In the case of the lower temperature, kBT /ε = 0.35, the ﬁrst order contributions quickly

grow with density until at high densities, they are larger than the zeroth order contributions

thus suggesting that the perturbation theory will not prove very accurate. At the higher

temperature, kBT /ε = 1.5, the ﬁrst order contributions are much better controlled and we

expect the perturbation theory to be relatively accurate.

We have also tested the various approaches to the selection of the separation point of the

potential - the WCA prescription, eq.(2), the WCAR prescription and minimization of the

free energy with respect to r0. As expected, the only signiﬁcant diﬀerences occur at high

density, where variations of the free energy of 10% occur, but we ﬁnd virtually no eﬀect on

the phase diagram.

IV. PHASE DIAGRAMS

Figure 3 shows the phase diagram as calculated from the WCAR theory for the potential

and parameters used by ten Wolde and Frenkel[1] and its comparison to the results of

Monte Carlo simulations by these authors for α = 50. The lines, from our calculations,

and the symbols, from the simulations, divide the density-temperature phase diagram into

three parts: the liquid region (low density and high temperature), the ﬂuid-solid coexistence

region and the solid region (at high density). In the calculations, the lines are determined by

ﬁnding, for a given temperature, the liquid and solid densities that give equal pressures and

chemical potentials for the two phases as determined using eq.(13) based on the liquid and

solid free energy calculations (which diﬀer only in the equation of state and pair distribution

function of the reference states). The ﬂuid-ﬂuid coexistence is determined similarly except

that the free energy for both phases is calculated using the same reference state (the hard-

sphere ﬂuid) with the resulting free energy exhibiting a Van der Waals loop.

The calculations and simulations are in good qualitative agreement with a ﬂuid-ﬂuid

critical point that is suppressed by the ﬂuid-solid phase boundaries. The values of the

coexisting densities are in good agreement at low temperatures, where the liquid density

is very low and at high temperatures. That these limits agree is as expected from our

discussion of the relative sizes of the various contributions to the free energy. It is perhaps

surprising that the agreement is so good even for temperatures as low as kBT /ε

1. The

∼

intermediate temperature values, where the attractive tail and ﬁnite density eﬀects are

important, are the most poorly described. The same is true of the ﬂuid-ﬂuid coexistence

curve. The critical point is estimated to occur at about kBT /ε

diﬀerent choices for the pair distribution function of the reference state (see eqs.(10)-(11)),

and diﬀerent choices for the division of the potential (such as minimizing the free energy

with respect to the break point) but none of these alternatives produces any signiﬁcant

change.

An interesting feature of short-ranged interactions is that under some circumstances, they

give rise to solid-solid transitions where the lattice structure remains the same but solids of

diﬀerent densities can coexist (i.e. a van der Waals loop occurs in the solid free energy)[26].

We have searched for, but ﬁnd no evidence of, such a transition with the present potential.

Fig. 4 the calculated isothermal free energies as a function of density between the coexisting

ﬂuid and solid phases at kBT /ǫ = 0.4 for the short-ranged (α = 50) potential. The ﬂuid has

a density of 0.008 and Helmholtz free energy of -5.82 in reduced units. The maximum free

energy is -2.57 and the solid free energy is -5.02 at a density of 0.88.

Figure 5 shows the phase diagrams calculated from the WCAR theory as a function of

the range of the potential (i.e., diﬀerent values of α). For α = 1, for which the minimum of

the potential well is rmin = 1.5 and corresponding to a tail that closely resembles a standard

Lennard-Jones interaction, the phase diagram has the classical form exhibiting three stable

phases, a critical point and a triple point. As α increases, and the range of the potential

decreases, the critical point moves towards the triple point. Even for α = 5 and rmin = 1.31,

the critical point lies very near the triple point and the two become nearly identical for

α = 10 and rmin = 1.26. Our conclusion is that for this model, the suppression of the triple

point occurs when the range of the potential, as characterized by its minimum, falls to about

a quarter of the hard-core diameter.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Our aim here has been to provide a fundamental model of protein crystallization without

the need for parameterizations other than the interaction potential. Since the potential

for globular proteins can be tuned, by varying e.g. the background ionic strength of the

solutions, this provides a rather direct connection between theoretical indications of favorable

conditions for nucleation and experimentally accessible control parameters.

We have shown that thermodynamic perturbation theory gives a good, semi-quantitative

estimate of the phase diagram of a model interaction for globular proteins. The accuracy of

the perturbation theory is expected to improve as the range of the potential increases so, e.g.,

the prediction of the value of α at which the critical point becomes suppressed is expected to

be reasonably accurate. Unlike the results of a recent study of colloids interacting via short-

ranged potentials[27], we do not ﬁnd that the second order terms in the high-temperature

expansion play an important role in the structure of the phase diagram.

This free energy calculation, which only uses the interaction model as input, should be

contrasted with other more phenomenological approaches. In phase ﬁeld models, the free

energy is taken to be a function of one or more order parameters. The actual form of the

free energy is typically of the Landau form which is to say, a square-gradient term plus an

algebraic function of more than second order in the order parameter. The coeﬃcients of

these terms must be ﬁtted to experimental data and the adequacy of the assumed function

is diﬃcult to assess. Similarly, the recent density functional models of Talanquer[7] and

Shiryayev[8] depend on an ad hoc free energy functional, based on the van der Waals free

energy model for the ﬂuid, with several phenomenological parameters.

We believe that our work can serve as the basis for further theoretical study of the

nucleation of globular proteins using density functional theory. While the present description

of the two phases requires as input separate equations of state and pair distribution functions

for the reference hard sphere ﬂuid and solid phases, standard methods exist for interpolating

between these so as to provide a single, uniﬁed free energy functional suitable to the study

of free energy barriers (see,e.g. ref.[28]). Such a uniﬁed model can be used to study static

properties, such as the structure of the critical nucleas, using density functional theory as

well as the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations on the transition rates by the addition of noise obeying the

ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem.

Finally, it would be desirable to confront the approach developed here to experiments

aiming to determine the interaction potential and the phase diagram of concrete globular

proteins of interest such as lysozyme and catalase.

In recent years, considerable eﬀort

was devoted to protein crystallization under microgravity conditions on the grounds that

some undesirable eﬀects such as density gradients and advection present in earth-bound

experiments can be virtually suppressed[29]. In parallel, earth-bound experiments are being

carried out to determine conditions and parameters to be used in a microgravity experiment.

In either case, the role of the metastable critical point has so far not been addressed in a

detailed manner. We believe that the availability of a theory as parameter-free as possible

like the one developed in the present work could provide the frame for undertaking such a

study on a rational basis.

APPENDIX A: EVALUATION OF LONG-RANGED CONTRIBUTION TO THE

We begin by writing the ﬁrst order contribution of the long-ranged potential as

d−→r ghs (r) w (r) =

d−→r ghs (r) v (r)

d−→r ghs (r) v0 (r)

(A1)

so that the second term involves the very short ranged function v0 (r) and is easily performed

numerically. Our focus is therefore on the evaluation of the ﬁrst term on the right. If we

write the potential as the sum of a hard-core and a continuous tail

v (r) = vhs (r) + Θ (r

and the eﬀective hard-sphere diameter d

σ, as it clearly will always be, then

so that we can ignore the discontinuity of the hard-core potential and treat and simply

deal with the continuous tail potential. The ﬁrst term can be evaluated by introducing the

inverse Laplace transform of rvtail (r) ,

rvtail (r) =

The Percus-Yevick pair distribution function becomes exact at low densities but is only

semi-quantitatively accurate at moderate to high densities. Compared to the pdf deter-

mined from computer simulations, its oscillations are slightly out of phase and the pressure

calculated from it is in error. The Verlet Weiss pair distribution function is a semi-empirical

modiﬁcation of the basic Percus-Yevick result designed to correct these ﬂaws. It is written

as

inside the core, d0 is an eﬀective hard-sphere diameter which has the eﬀect of shifting the

phase of the oscillations, and C and m are chosen to give the accurate Carnahan-Starling

equation of state via both the pressure equation and the compressibility equation. To apply

the Laplace technique in this case requires some care since what we know is the Laplace

transform of gP Y (r; ρ, d0) and not that of Θ (r

d) gP Y (r; ρ, d0). So we rewrite eq.(A8) as

that d0

approximate the pair distribution function as in ref.[20]) while the third integral is easily

evaluated numerically. All parts of the calculation are therefore well controlled.

Finally, we note that the same techniques can be adapted to the evaluation of the second

We study the three-dimensional static conﬁgurations of nonhomogeneous Kirchhoﬀ ﬁlaments with
periodically varying Young’s modulus. We analyse the eﬀects of the Young’s modulus oscillations
in the stroboscopic maps, and in the regular (non chaotic) spatial conﬁgurations of the ﬁlaments.
For a certain range of frequencies of the oscillations a single equilibrium exists, corresponding to
a slightly deformed helix. As the frequency of the oscillations increases beyond this range, a new
equilibrium conﬁguration arises, corresponding to a highly twisted rod. Increasing the frequency
even more makes, on one hand, the original slightly deformed helix conﬁguration become twisted, the
corresponding equilibrium point eventually disappearing. On the other hand, the new equilibrium
conﬁguration gets untwisted, becoming very similar to a slightly deformed helix, characteristic of
the original equilibrium conﬁguration. We comment on possible applications to tandemly repeated
sequences of DNA.

The study of tridimensional structures of ﬁlamentary
objects is of great interest in several areas of knowledge,
ranging from microscopic to macroscopic systems. Exam-
ples of macroscopic systems in Engineering are the sta-
bility of suboceanic cables[1, 2] and installation of optical
ﬁbers [3, 4]; in Biology, the shape of climbing plants[5];
and, in Physics and Mathematics, the shape and dynam-
ics of cracking whips[6]. The microscopic examples are in
the area of the Structural Biology, as in the study of the
structure of biomolecules[7, 8] and bacterial ﬁbers[9, 10].
Usually, those systems are modeled as thin uniform
rods but, in some cases, it is interesting to investigate
how nonuniformities of the ﬁlament aﬀect its tridimen-
sional structure. The so-called Kirchhoﬀ rod model[11]
is a good framework to study both the statics and the

shown that nonhomogeneous Kirchhoﬀ rods may present
spatial chaos[14, 15]. These nonhomogeneities can be of
two kinds: i) in the stiﬀness of the rod; ii) in the shape of
its cross section. In this paper we analyse the ﬁrst case
by allowing a small periodic perturbation in the Young’s
modulus along the rod.

Hogan and Austin [16] demonstrated that the DNA
stiﬀness is sequence-dependent. It is also known [17, 18]
that a substantial fraction of all eukaryotic genomes are
tandemly repeated sequences of DNA. These repetitive
DNAs are formed by nucleotide sequences of varying
lengths and compositions reaching up to 100 megabase-
pairs of length [18]. Usually they are regarded as “selﬁsh”
or “junk” DNA [19] because they seem to have little or no
functional role. In fact, some studies suggest that the be-
havior of repetitive sequences can be, in some cases, ben-
eﬁcial to the organism and, in others, harmful [17, 18].
It could also be related to some form of cancer [20].

In this paper we consider small periodic variations of
the Young’s modulus, motivated by the existence of large

amounts of repetitive sequences of DNA. We model these
periodic variations using the recent computation of the
Young’s modulus of all 32 trinucleotide units [21]. We
analyse the eﬀects of the frequency of these periodic mod-
ulations in the Young’s modulus, in both the stroboscopic
maps and the structure of the periodic (non-chaotic)
equilibrium solutions. We shall show how the sequence-
dependent mechanical properties of ﬁlaments deviate its
tridimensional structure from the well known uniform so-
lution, namely, the helix. Usually, continuous elastic rod
models are considered a good ﬁrst approximation for the
structure of long DNA molecules[7]. Our results must
also be considered as a ﬁrst approximation of the eﬀects
of these sequence-dependent mechanical properties in the
structure.

The Kirchhoﬀ rod model [11, 12] has been extensively
used in the literature to model continuous rods. For ex-
ample, Shi and Hearst[22] and Nizette and Goriely[23]
obtained and classiﬁed, respectively, all the solutions of
the static Kirchhoﬀ equations for homogeneous rods with
circular cross section. A complete analysis of the stabil-
ity of the static solutions subject to boundary conditions
was performed by Coleman et al [24]. Recently, da Fon-
seca and de Aguiar [25] have developed a method for
obtaining the equilibrium solution of a ﬁnite rod sub-
jected to boundary conditions. In the case of nonhomo-
geneous rods Davies and Moon [15] showed the mathe-
matical analogy between nonhomogeneous Kirchhoﬀ ﬁl-
aments and spinning tops with non-constant moments
of inertia, being therefore susceptible to spatial chaos. A
more rigorous analysis of this analogy has been performed
by Mielke and Holmes [14]. Fonseca and de Aguiar [26]
studied the eﬀects of nonhomogeneous mass density in
the dynamics of Kirchhoﬀ ﬁlaments. A particular case of
nonhomogeneous Young’s modulus was applied to closed
rods by Yang et al [8]. In the case of a rod resembling

the DNA molecule, Manning et al [27] used the Kirchhoﬀ
model to study the sequence-dependent intrinsic curva-
ture of DNA. In the present study we assume that the
DNA is intrinsically an untwisted straight rod, but we
include sequence-dependent stiﬀness.

FIG. 1: Stroboscopic maps for Pψ = 0.086, Pφ = 0.043 and
F = 20pN. The frequency of the Young’s modulus oscillation
in each map is: (a) ω = 0.60ω0; (b) ω = 0.82ω0; (c) ω =
0.85ω0; (d) ω = 0.90ω0; (e) ω = 0.92ω0; (f) ω = 1.00ω0; (g)
ω = 1.20ω0; (h) ω = 1.60ω0; (i) ω = 2.00ω0.

We shall consider the Hamiltonian formulation of the
Kirchhoﬀ’s equations.
Instead of using the rigorous of
the Hamiltonian formulation by Mielke and Holmes [14],
we shall follow the simplest derivation by Nizette and
Goriely [23]. The reader is referred to [12, 13, 25] for a
derivation of the Kirchhoﬀ model, and to ref.[23] for the
Hamiltonian formulation. Hamilton’s equations for the
Kirchhoﬀ model are analogous to those of a symmetric
spinning top in a gravity ﬁeld, with the arc length s along
the rod playing the role of time. The main advantage of
a Hamiltonian formulation is that the theory of chaotic
Hamiltonian systems and stroboscopic maps can be di-
rectly applied to understand the spatial behavior of the
ﬁlament. The length of the tandemly repeated sequences
can reach up to 100 megabasepairs [18] while the length
of the repeats is no more than a few hundreds of base-
pairs long. So we shall solve the Kirchhoﬀ’s equations as
an initial value problem (IVP) to ﬁnd the conformational
solutions of the ﬁlament problem.

The Hamiltonian for an elastic rod with circular cross

where E = E(s) and µ = µ(s) are the scaled Young’s and
shear moduli, respectively. F is the total contact force
exerted on the cross section at s. The units used here
are the same of refs. [12, 13, 25]. Γ0 varies between 2/3
(incompressible material) and 1 (hyper-elastic material),
and it should be remarked that Γ0 has no inﬂuence in
the equilibrium solutions. The momenta are deﬁned by

Pθ ≡ E(s)θ′ ,
Pφ ≡ Γ0µ(s) (φ′ + ψ′ cos θ) ,

Pψ ≡ E(s)ψ′ sin

where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to
s.

In the case of a homogeneous ﬁlament, E(s) ≡ 1 and
µ(s) ≡ 1 in the equation (1), and the Hamiltonian is
written as:

This potential has a minimum and it is important to
obtain the frequency ω0 of small oscillations around it.
Denoting that minimum by θ0, we ﬁnd:

ω0 = P 2

φ + 2V (θ0) − 6F cos θ0.

The Euler angles θ, φ and ψ connect a ﬁxed Cartesian
basis {e1, e2, e3} to the local orthonormal basis di =
di(s, t), i = 1, 2, 3, attached to each point of the rod.
d3 is chosen to be tangent to the curve x(s) that deﬁnes
the axis of the ﬁlament, and d1 and d2 are in the di-
rection of the principal moments of inertia of the cross
section (perpendicular to d3). The momentum Pψ is the
e3-component of the angular momentum with respect to
the axis of the rod and Pφ is the torsional moment, i.
e., the momentum with respect to d3 [23]. They remain
constant along the rod even if E and µ depend on the
arc length s. The Hamiltonian, eq.(1), will depend on s
through E(s) and µ(s).

We shall consider the following periodic variation of

the scaled Young’s modulus:

E(s) = 1 + α cos ωs .

(6)

In order to cover most of the interval spanned by the
[21], the
trinucleotides Young’s modulus given in ref.
maximum value of α is 0.66. ω is the frequency of the
Young’s modulus oscillation. We are concerned only with
the the tridimensional shape of the rod and it should be

stressed that the shear modulus µ(s) does not aﬀect the
tridimensional conﬁguration.

To obtain the equilibrium conﬁgurations we ﬁrst solve
Hamilton’s equations for θ and Pθ. Then, we solve Eq.(2)
for ψ and reconstruct the ﬁlament by integrating d3 along
s:

s

Z

x(s) =

[(sin θ cos ψ) e1+(sin θ sin ψ) e2+(cos θ) e3]ds

(7)
x(s) is a function of the initial conditions θ(s = 0) ≡ θ0
and Pθ(s = 0) ≡ P0. Without lack of generality, P0
can be set equal to 0 so that θ0 will be a conformation
parameter. In solving the equation for ψ we set its initial
value ψ0 = 0.

FIG. 2: Shape evolution of the conformations corresponding
to the center of the main island seen in Fig.1a. (a) ω = 0.60ω0
(Fig.1a); (b) ω = 0.82ω0 (Fig.1b); (c) ω = 0.85ω0 (Fig.1c);
(d) ω = 0.92ω0 (Fig.1e).

In what follows we show numerical calculations per-
formed with the following ﬁxed mechanical parameters:
α = 0.1, Pψ = 0.086, Pφ = 0.043 and F = 20pN.
These parameters, excepting the force F , are written in
properly scaled units. The value of Pφ corresponds to
an excess of 5% of the linking number[28] due to ther-
mal ﬂuctuations. The value of the force corresponds to
a compressing force consistent with the values in the
literature[29].

Figure 1 shows nine stroboscopic maps on the θ − Pθ
plane for diﬀerent values of frequency ω. We start with
ω = 0.60ω0 (Fig. 1a) where a larger stability island en-
closes the main equilibrium point at θ ≃ 2.08rad and
Pθ = 0, and a smaller island is seen on the left, at
θ ≃ 0.5rad. The frequency goes up to ω = 2.00ω0.

As we go through the sequence of stroboscopic maps
displayed in the Figure 1, the large island in the plate

FIG. 3: Shape evolution of the conformations corresponding
to the center of the left island that appears when ω > 0.81ω0
(Fig.1b). (a) ω = 0.82ω0 (Fig.1b); (b) ω = 0.85ω0 (Fig.1c);
(c) ω = ω0 (Fig.1f); (d) ω = 1.60ω0 (Fig.1h).

(a) slowly shrinks and eventually disappears at ω ≈ ω0
(Figs. 1e and 1f). A second important island appears
at ω ≈ 0.82ω0 (Fig. 1b). This new island increases in
size and moves towards the right as ω is increased. Be-
sides these two main islands, a number of smaller and
short-lived islands pop up and disappear as ω changes, a
phenomenon typical of chaotic maps. We shall concen-
trate our study on the two main islands described above,
since they dominate the stroboscopic maps and last for
large intervals of ω.

We shall now investigate the diﬀerences in the shape
of the tridimensional conﬁgurations corresponding to the
two equilibrium points lying at the center of these islands.
In order to construct the rods we solved the Hamiltonian
equations using the values of the equilibrium point for
θ and Pθ as initial conditions θ0 and P0 and used the
equation (7) to construct the ﬁlament.

The shape of the equilibrium point tridimensional con-
ﬁguration changes as the frequency is varied. This shape
evolution is displayed in the Figures 2 and 3 for the two
main equilibrium points mentioned above.

In the Figure 2, panels (a) to (d), we show the shape
evolution of the conﬁguration corresponding to the ﬁrst
main equilibrium point which lies in the center of the
main island appearing in the Figure 1a, and in the center
of the island on the right in the Figs. 1b, 1c and 1e,
respectively. We can see from the ﬁgure 2 that the shape
of the rod deviates more and more from the helix pattern
as ω is increased, becoming rather twisted for ω = 0.92ω0.
In the ﬁgure 3, panels (a) to (d), we show the shape
evolution of the conﬁguration corresponding to the other

main equilibrium point which lies in the center of the
‘left island’ (it was born in Fig.1b). The conﬁgurations
shown in the ﬁgure 3a-d correspond to the frequency val-
ues of ﬁgures 1b, 1c, 1f and 1h, respectively. The be-
havior of this sequence of rod shapes is the reverse of
that corresponding to the ﬁrst equilibrium point (Fig. 2).
As ω increases, the shape becomes less coiled and even-
tually recovers the near-helix shape, similar to the rod
shape Fig. 2a, corresponding to the ﬁrst equilibrium
point (Fig. 1a).

FIG. 4: Tridimensional conﬁguration of the period doubled
orbit, at the center of the twin islands in the Fig.1i.

Finally, when ω = 2ω0, Fig.1i, a ‘period-doubling’ bi-
furcations occurs. The orbit at the center of the island
becomes unstable and a new stable equilibrium, with
twice the original period, appears. Figure 4 shows the

4

tridimensional conﬁguration of the period doubled orbit.

It is interesting to notice that, as the frequency in-
creases, the position of the equilibrium point on the left
island in Fig.1b moves in the direction of increasing θ. In
contrast, the position of the original equilibrium point,
at the center of the right island in Fig.1a, remains prac-
tically unchanged until it disappears at ω ≈ ω0. As the
position of the left equilibrium gets close to where the
right equilibrium used to be, the shape of the correspond-
ing tridimensional conﬁguration becomes similar to the
helix, as we can see in the ﬁgure 3.

The main result of this numerical experiment is that
the tridimensional conformations of the DNA may be
very sensitive to sequence-dependent properties, espe-
cially if these are in resonance with other natural periods
of the ﬁlament. As expected, in the limit of very low or
very high frequencies, as compared to ω0, the shape of the
solutions remain very close to that of the homogeneous

other elements, besides sequence-dependent eﬀects, com-
bine to determine the conformation of DNA molecules,
like self-contact, salt concentration, anisotropy and in-
teraction with proteins. Our results show that sequence-
dependent eﬀects alone may have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on the shape of the DNA. This could be, therefore, a
possible mechanical function of the “junk” sequences.

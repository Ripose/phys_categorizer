Abstract

In this article, we propose a network spread model for HIV epidemics, wherein
each individual is represented by a node of the transmission network and the edges
are the connections between individuals along which the infection may spread. The
sexual activity of each individual, measured by its degree, is not homogeneous but
obeys a power-law distribution. Due to the heterogeneity of activity, the infection
can persistently exist at a very low prevalence, which has been observed in real
data but can not be illuminated by previous models with homogeneous mixing
hypothesis. Furthermore, the model displays a clear picture of hierarchical spread: In
the early stage the infection is adhered to these high-risk persons, and then, diﬀuses
toward low-risk population. The prediction results show that the development of
epidemics can be roughly categorized into three patterns for diﬀerent countries,
and the pattern of a given country is mainly determined by the average sex-activity
and transmission probability per sexual partner. In most cases, the eﬀect of HIV
epidemics on demographic structure is very small. However, for some extremely
countries, like Botswana, the number of sex-active people can be depressed to nearly
a half by AIDS.

Key words: HIV/AIDS epidemics, Scale-free networks, Mathematical modeling,
Demography.

1 Introduction

AIDS (Acquired Immure Deﬁciency Syndrome), as one of the most dangerous
diseases over human history, has been continuously spreading at an enormous

Preprint submitted to Elsevier Science

speed with an extremely high rate of death (from the moment when the ﬁrst
infection case was conﬁrmed). Now it has already spread to all the regions of
the world and been a great threat not only to the human health but also to
the human society due to its own epidemiologic characters which make the
objection to AIDS an extremely complex and diﬃcult task to address.

A high infection rate of population will cause catastrophe to the development
of national economy for two reasons. On one hand, most infected people are
in a group aged from 24 to 45 who do the main contributions to the country’s
productivity, thus the AIDS will cause a great decline of the social wealth. On
the other hand, to carry out a widely covered treatment program on treating
the HIV infected people will be a heavy burden for the government ﬁnance due
to the great cost on expensive medicine as well as regularly and continuously
implemented therapy. Therefore, to investigate the edpidemic behaviors of
HIV/AIDS appears not only of great theoretical interest in understanding the
underlying spreading mechanism, but also necessary and urgent in practice.

The extensively investigated models for epidemics, such as the standard
susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS)
models, often involve two hypotheses [1,2,3,4]. First, the population is as-
sumed closed, that is, the population size is ﬁxed. However, recent researches
on the spread of HIV (especially in Africa and other worst-aﬄicted areas)
indicate the existence of strongly interplay between HIV epidemics and age
structures, thus the demographic impact can not be neglected (see the review
papers [5,6] and the references therein). Secondly, the epidemiological mod-
els are often established based on perfect and homogeneous mixing, that is
to say, all individuals are able to infect all others and the infectivity of each
individual is almost the same. To replace the perfect mixing assumption, one
can introduce the epidemic contact network, wherein the nodes denote indi-
viduals and edges represent the connections between individuals along which
the infection may spread (see the review papers [7,8] about network epidemics
and the references therein). The infected individual can infect a susceptible
one only if they are neighboring in the network. The homogeneous mixing
assumption can be implemented by using epidemic contact networks with ho-
mogeneous degree distributions [9], such as regular lattices, random networks
[10], and so on. However, recent empirical data exhibit us that the real-world
sexual contact patterns are far diﬀerent from the homogeneous ones [11,12,13].
The corresponding networks, similar to many other real-life networks, display
the so-called scale-free property [14,15], that is, they are of power-law de-
gree distributions. This power-law distribution falls oﬀ much more gradually
than an exponential one, allowing a few nodes of very large degree to exist.
These high-degree nodes are called hub nodes in network science [15,16,17,18]
and superspreaders in epidemiological literatures [19,20]. Recent theoretical
researches on epidemics show that the topology of epidemic contact networks
will highly aﬀect the dynamical behaviors [21,22], and it is also demonstrated

2

that the eﬀect of the superspreaders on HIV epidemics can not be ignored
[23,24]. Therefore, the structural eﬀect should be taken into account when
modeling HIV/AIDS epidemics. In addition, the introduction of Antiretrovi-
ral (ARV) drug therapy is also one of the important result-dependent factors
[25,26]. No treatment is more eﬃcient for HIV-infected individuals than the
medicine, which combines two or three antiretroviral drugs in ”cocktail” reg-
imens. These regimens, known as highly active ARV therapy, have resulted
in the reduction of HIV levels in the blood, often to undetectable levels, and
have markedly improved immune function of HIV-infected individuals. The
advent and widespread application of ARV has dramatically changed the typ-
ical course of HIV infection and AIDS, especially in high-income countries [27].
On the other hand, however, in the low-income countries, the overwhelming
proportion of HIV-infected persons has no access to ARV. In sub-Saharan
Africa, for example, this lack of treatment access has transformed into rapidly
escalating death rates. Although the usage of ARV appears eﬀective in bating
HIV, it will bring too heavy pressure in economy for poor countries. There-
fore, the better understanding of the eﬀect of ARV treatment may enlighten
readers in allocating the ﬁnancial resources.

Although the demographic structure [28,29] and sexual contact pattern [30,31],

respectively, has been taken into account in the previous HIV/AIDS epidemic
models, there are few works simultaneously consider these two ingredients. In
the present model, both the demographic impact and heterogeneity mixing
eﬀect are considered. And many important features of real-life HIV epidemics
can be naturally generated by combining these two ingredients. This article is
organized as follows: In section 2, the model is presented in details. In section
3, the main properties of this model are shown. Then, in section 4, we will try
to predict the HIV/AIDS epidemics by this model. Finally, we sum up this
article and discuss the relevance of this model to the real world in section 5.

2 Model

2.1 Construction of Epidemic Contact Networks

The HIV is transmitted by body ﬂuid through several main routes including
sexual contacts, sharing injectors among drug users, perinatal transmissions,
transfusion of contaminated blood products etc., which are closely related
to human beings’ social activities. In diﬀerent regions the popularity of each
route is variable according to the culture and social circumstance. In some
areas the homosexual contacts and injecting drug use play the main role in
HIV epidemics, while the main track in HIV transmission is the heterosexual
contacts in the global scope [32]. Therefore, in this model, only the hetero-

3

sexual relationships are taken into account, thus the corresponding epidemic
contact networks are bipartite graphs [33,34].

The epidemic contact network starts with N0/2 males and N0/2 females,
each of which is sex-active with age between 15 and 49, and only the hetero-
sexual contacts are permissive. Since men tend to over-report their number
of partners whereas women tend to under-report, the total numbers of sex-
ual partners of males and females are not equal in existing surveys [11,29].
However, for simpliﬁcation, we assume the degree distribution for both male
and female nodes are the same. Assign each male node’s degree according to
a given degree distribution p(k) ∼ k−γ with minimal degree kmin = 1. Ac-
cording to the empirical data in Sweden [11], we set γ = 3.5. After obtaining
the degree sequence of male nodes, we let the female nodes have the same
degree sequence and randomly assign each female node’s degree according to
this sequence. Here the degree sequence means a set of all nodes’ degrees, one
can ﬁnd a more detailed and strict deﬁnition in ref. [35]. The edges are gener-
ated randomly by using the mechanism of conﬁguration model [36]. Note that,
diﬀerent from most previous studies about epidemics on static networks, the
present network structure evolves with time according to some followed rules
of HIV epidemic dynamics.

2.2 Modelling spread of HIV/AIDS in networks

We focus on the network susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model in which
individuals can be in three discrete states, susceptible, infected or removed
(dead). The infected ones can be divided into two subclasses: The HIV-positive
individuals and persons with AIDS. Since the median time from AIDS to
death is very short (about 7 month for adults [37]) compared with the median
incubation time for AIDS [38], we assume that when an HIV-positive person
becomes an AIDS-patient, she or he will immediately be in death (i. e. within
one year). This model is implemented by computer simulation with a time
step equal to one year when mimicking the reality. The simulation processes
are as follows.

(1) Set all the nodes to be susceptible except one randomly selected infected

one.

(2) At each time step for each susceptible node x, denote m1 and m2 the
number of its neighboring infected nodes not in process of ARV treatment
(non-ARV user) or contrary (ARV user), respectively. The probability that
the node x will become infected in the next time step is

πx = 1 − (1 − β1)m1(1 − β2)m2,

(1)

4

if x is male. Here β• is the transmission probability per sexual partner, which
is considered as a more appropriate estimate than probability per sexual act
[39], and the subscript represents whether the corresponding HIV-positive
person has taken the ARV treatment. Since the male-to-female transmission
is about twice eﬃcient as female-to-male transmission [40], if x is female, the
corresponding probability is

πx = 1 − (1 − 2β1)m1(1 − 2β2)m2,

(2)

where β1 and β2 are restricted below 0.5. It has been estimated by an analysis
of longitudinal cohort data that antiretroviral therapy reduces per-partnership
infectivity by as much as 60% [27], thus we set β2 = 0.4β1.

(3) At each time step, each infected node (except the newly infected ones)
may die with probability either ζ1 (for non-ARV user) or ζ2 (for ARV user).
According to the recent estimations [41], we set ζ1 = 0.15 and ζ2 = 0.08. The
dead individuals are removed from the population.

Repeat these processes for desired time. Note that, each newly infected node
will be ARV user at probability ρARV, and all the existing ARV users will keep
using ARV.

2.3 Demographic Impact

In this model, all the nodes (sex-active persons) are divided into 7 age-groups
(labeled A1-A7): 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49. At beginning,
each node chooses to be in one age-group with probability according to the
age structure in the year corresponding to time step zero. At each time step,
each female individual may bear a child according the corresponding age-
speciﬁc fertility rates. If she is infected and has not taken ARV treatment, the
perinatal transmission probability is ε1. And it reduces to ε2 if ARV treatment
is taken. Based on some previous empirical studies [28,42], we set ε1 = 0.4 and
ε2 = 0.2. The infected elder persons (> 49 year) may die with probability γ1
or γ2 during each time step, and the corresponding probability for perinatally
infected children is 0.2 [42].

At the end of each time step, 1/5 randomly selected living persons in age-
group A1-A6 will reach the elder group, and 1/5 randomly selected living
persons in group A7 will be removed from this system. If the time step t
is less than 15, we simply assume equal number (to the number of removal
nodes in A1) of susceptible individuals will be added to group A1; else if
t ≤ 15, b(t − 15) individuals will be added to group A1, where b(t) denotes
the number of newborn babies without HIV at time t. Here we simply assume

5

all the infected babies will die before 15 years old since the mortality per year
for them is much higher than adults. All these newly added ones will joint
the epidemic contact network according to the rules of Section 2.1, that is,
the female/male nodes will randomly choose sexual partners among all the
young and old men/women according to their given degrees that obey the
distribution p(k).

See the Appendix A for the source of all the population and demographic

data.

3 Main Properties

There are three free parameters in the present model: the average degree hki
which determine the degree distribution when the power-law exponent γ = 3.5
is given, the transmission probability β1, and the ARV-receiving rate ρARV.
The former two parameters are relative to the behaviors while the last one
is partially dependent on ﬁnancial conditions. In this section, we will show
some simulation results and investigate the main properties about this model
by adjusting the above parameters. Some previous works show that for most
cases, the qualitative features of epidemic dynamics will not be aﬀected by
the slightly varying of population size and age-structure [5,28,29,43], thus in
this section, the age-speciﬁc fertility rates are kept unchanged. We use the
age-density and age-speciﬁc fertility rates of China in 2005 for initialization,
with the age-speciﬁc fertility rates unchanged all through. The network size is
N = 106.

3.1 Eﬀect of the Heterogeneous Degree Distribution

Many infections including HIV/AIDS can persistently exist in population
despite of a very low prevalence. This epidemiological phenomenon can not
be illuminated by previous models with homogeneous mixing hypothesis [7,8].
By using the epidemic contact network with power-law degree distribution,
the present model can reproduce the above observed phenomenon, which is
in accordance with some previous theoretical studies about SIS/SIR models
on scale-free networks [21,22,44,45]. Note that, since there are newly added
susceptible individuals at each time step, the dynamic behaviors of present
model may be closer to SIS model than SIR model. Figure 1 reports a typ-
ical simulation result wherein the prevalence of HIV is only about 2 × 10−3.
However, the infections can persistently exist for thousands years. For compar-
ison, we exhibit the situation under homogeneous mixing hypothesis in ﬁgure
2, where the three parameters (hki, β1, ρARV) are the same but all the nodes

have ﬁxed degree 3. The prevalence increases in the early stage since only few
HIV-positive persons die, and then dies out obeying a linear form.

In addition, this model displays oscillatory behaviors, which have been ob-
served in real world [46,47] and reproduced by some previous network epidemic
models based on small-world networks [48,49,50] or scale-free networks [51].
One can see references [52,53] for the concept of small-world networks. How-
ever, since the time from ﬁrst report about HIV cases to now is relative short
compared with the oscillatory period, we can not make sure if the real-life
HIV epidemics showing some kinds of oscillation.

3.2 Eﬀect of Transmission Probability

The transmission probability β1 not only depends on the pathological charac-
ters of HIV, but only can be managed by government and other organizations.
For example, the popularization of the usage of condoms will sharply reduce
the transmission probability per sexual partner/act as observed in Thailand
and Cambodia [54,55]. Figure 3 exhibits the ρARV − t curves for diﬀerent β1:
When β1 is large, the prevalence ﬂeetly increase until considerable ratio of
whole population gets infected, while for smaller β1, the infection either per-

sistently exists in a low prevalence-level, or vanishes.

3.3 Eﬀect of Average Degree

We have also investigated the eﬀect of average degree hki on network epi-
demic behaviors. As shown in ﬁgure 4, the behaviors of this model are very
sensitive to the mean degree. Clearly, larger mean degree will statistically
enlarge the probability of coming into contact with infected individuals, thus
leading to more serious situation. Combine this result and that of section 3.1,
one will ﬁnd that the epidemic behaviors are highly aﬀected by the network
topology.

3.4 Impact of Antiretroviral Drug Therapies

The antiretroviral drug therapies have two opposite eﬀects. On one hand, it
will reduce the probabilities of both sexual transmission and perinatal trans-
mission, thus ought to be very helpful in controlling the epidemic spreads
[27,41]. On the other hand, this treatment will increase the life expectancy

for HIV-positive persons and these ARV users can infected more individuals
if they do not stop their risky behaviors, thus this treatment may on the con-
trary increase the incidence of HIV/AIDS [25,56]. Here, we assume the usage
of ARV will not change patients’ behaviors, and in ﬁgure 5, one can ﬁnd that
this treatment can substantially reduce HIV epidemics, and even be possible
to eradicate high prevalence HIV epidemics under certain ideal conditions. It
is worthwhile to emphasize that, the simulation results in ﬁgure 5 strongly
depend on the choices of some dubious and imprecise parameters [27,41] such
as the ratios β2/β1, ζ2/ζ1 and ε2/ε1. Therefore, the corresponding results are
not confessed. Maybe further empirical and experimental studies about an-
tiretroviral drug therapies may lead to more accurate results. In addition, the
behavior parameters hki and β1 are more important than ρARV, and for very
large (hki, β1) case, the impact of antiretroviral drug therapies is very weak as
shown in ﬁgure 6. Hence, to reduce the risky behaviors is much more eﬀective
in the ﬁght against HIV/AIDS rather than ARV treatment, especially for the
poor countries. The cases of Thailand [54] and Eastern Zimbabwe are very
good examples [58].

3.5 Hierarchical Spread of HIV Epidemic Outbreaks

In the epidemic contact networks, the degree can reﬂect the susceptibility
of individual to some extent, that is, the node with higher degree is easier to
be infected statistically [59]. Here, we investigate the behavior of the average
degree of the newly infected nodes in networks at time t, denoted by kinf (t).
We use the average of 10 realizations to reduce the ﬂuctuations. As shown in
ﬁgure 7, the dynamical spreading process is therefore clear: After the high-
risk population are infected within a short time, the spread is going towards
generic population (low-risk population). This hierarchical spread, has been
reported in some previous pure theoretical studies on SI model [60,61,62,63],
but not been emphasized in previous HIV/AIDS epidemic models. However,
this phenomenon has been observed in real-life HIV epidemics: In the early
stage the infection is adhered to these high-risk persons, such as sex workers,
injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and so on. And then, it
diﬀuses to generic population. As an typical example, one can see the situation
in China [64].

4 Relevance to the real HIV/AIDS Epidemics

Previous studies on the prediction of the HIV/AIDS epidemics mainly con-
centrate on the data of the number of reported HIV-positive cases. These
methods, like empirical Bayesian back-calculation method [65], can give a rel-
atively accurate prediction in short-term. However, it can not provide useful
information about the underlying dynamic mechanism. Therefore, In this sec-
tion, we will try to predict HIV/AIDS epidemics by using the present model.

The lack of comprehensive and authentic data is one of the most serious
problems in evaluating and predicting HIV/AIDS epidemics. For example,
in the year 2004, the Chinese Minister of Health reported that the number of
living HIV-positive persons is about 8.6×105, but in the year 2006, it says that
this number is completely incorrect due to the greatly overvaluing. Actually,
the veracity of the reported HIV-positive numbers is dubious. From the web
site of UNAIDS [32], except the data of HIV-positive numbers, one can also
obtain the data about the number of AIDS-patients from national sentinel
surveillances. These data are also dubious since the monitor policies are not
professional especially in developing countries and some AIDS-patients do not

want to report to the sentinel surveillances. However, the data from national
sentinel surveillances do not involve external estimating algorithm, thus we
believe they are at least more faithworthy than the HIV-positive numbers.

In ﬁgure 8, we show four typical forms of the time series of the number
of AIDS cases. Although there may be some other forms, the present fours

13

are representative. The most serious country is Tanzania, wherein a consider-
able ratio of whole population is infected. Without impelling control policies,
Tanzania will be completely destroyed before long. In China, the proportion
of AIDS cases seems very small but the amount of AIDS is quite large as a
result of the striking huge ensemble, and its quick and monotone increasing
trend brings us heavy misgivings. Thailand is a successful example of external
control. Once, Thailand, especially the northern Thailand, is the most seri-
ous country in Asia due to its thriving and prosperous pornographic business.
Delightfully, the government is cognizant of this problem and forces all the
sex workers using condoms. This policy leads to a sharply decreasing of HIV-
positive and AIDS-patient numbers. Some other countries, like Brazil, have
also achieved successful policies in controlling HIV/AIDS epidemics. However,
these emergent external policies bring great challenges in predicting. The most
optimistic situation is that of Belgium. The HIV/AIDS persists in a very low
prevalence level and no increasing trend is observed.

In our model, according the assumption in section 2.2, we consider the mor-
tality at time t as the number of newly monitored AIDS-patients. This quan-
tity, denoted by NAIDS-NEW , can be obtained from the model by combining
the death rolls of children, adults and old persons. Because of the computa-
tional limit, we can at most handle the epidemic contact network with size
N ∼ 107. However, the number of people aged from 15 to 49 in some countries
is much larger than 107. In order to compare the time series generated by our
model and those of real country, all the data are normalized by the population
size aged from 15 to 49. The normalized number of AIDS cases is denoted by
ρAIDS-NEW. In addition, we assume the number of AIDS cases NAIDS-NEW is
proportional to the HIV-positive number NHIV at a given time t. Denote the
normalized data from sentinel surveillances x(0), x(1), · · · , x(T ), and the data
generated from our model y(0), y(1), · · · , y(T ), the departure is deﬁned as

e =

[x(t) − y(t)]2.

Since the parameter ρARV is known after the country is selected (these data
can also be obtained from UNAIDS), there are only two tunable parameter β1
and hki. Hence this task degenerates to an optimal problem: Determine the
proper value of β1 and hki to minimize the departure e. The optimal problem
is carried out by searching all the values of (β1, hki) in the Cartesian prod-
uct of sets {0.01, 0.02, · · · , 0.50} and {1.0, 1.1, · · · , 10.0}, and choosing the one
corresponding to minimal e. The parameters will not change with time, that
is to say, the present prediction is valid only for the cases with no additional
interventions.

We have tried this prediction method for many representative countries, and

found the cases can be roughly divided into three patterns. The typical ex-
ample for the ﬁrst pattern is the United States (US), wherein the curve of
AIDS-patient number has an obvious peak before the year 2000, and then
decreases to a relative low and stable level. The similar behaviors have also
been found for many other countries, such as Mexico, Spain, Australia, Bel-
gium, Thailand, and so on. The common feature of these countries is that
their transmission probabilities are all small. This may be because of the high
popularization rates of condoms and disposable injectors.

China is a particular example, although the prevalence of AIDS cases are
very low, it increases exponentially fast in the early stage with exponent
≈ 0.15 ± 0.01, that is, ρAIDS-NEW ∼ e0.15t in the early stage. However, this
velocity will be slowed down and the number of AIDS cases will get steady
after the year 2025. This interesting behavior may due to the particular values
of β1 and hki in China. Traditionally, Chinese women are not supposed to have
sex with a man other than their future spouse, thus the mean degree is very
small compared to ’Western-style’ society. However, since the popularization
rate of the usage of condoms in China is very low (< 20%), the transmission
probability in China is much higher than these developed countries. In a word,
although no eﬃcient policies in controlling HIV epidemics have been imple-

mented in Chinese government or other organizations, the traditional moral
sense may protect China from suﬀering AIDS.

Note that, the shapes of NHIV(t) and ρAIDS-NEW(t) are slightly diﬀerent,
which attributes to the ﬂuctuation of population size. Although the numbers
of HIV-positive dwellers seems high in some countries, such as US and China,
their direct and indirect eﬀects on the demographic structure of the whole
population are very weak. If we ﬁxed β = 0 for US and China from 2006 to
2050, then the population size (aged from 15 to 49) without HIV/AIDS will
be almost the same as the original prediction results. Since the departures can
not be observed in plots, we have not shown here.

The most serious regions suﬀering AIDS are Africa (especially Sub-Saharan
Africa) [66,67,68] as well as Latin America and Caribbean region [69]. An typ-
ical example is Botswana, which is a relative rich country in Africa but has
the highest HIV prevalence all over the world. If no additional interventions,
the infection will kill more than 50% persons in their prime of life. The osten-
sible stable behavior after 2020 is on account of the existence of some no-risk
people: They adhere to monogamy and do not hit the pipe, thus will not be
infected. In network language, these individuals belong to some isolated clus-
ters. In network SIR model, these isolated clusters usually come into being as

a result of the removal of some individuals [70]. Other than US and China,
demographic impact of the HIV Epidemic in Botswana is striking. In ﬁgure
12, we compare the predicted population size (aged from 15 to 49) with the
no-AIDS case where we set β1 = 0 from 2006 to 2050. After year 2015, the pop-
ulation size sharply declines, which is the very reason of the decline of NHIV
in ﬁgure 11. Only by ten years, the population holds down to a half level. The
demographic gets stable in this new level since there are a number of no-risk
people. Finally, the age distribution in Botswana becomes sandglass-like since
many people in their prime of life (aged 15 to 49) will be killed by AIDS. We
are afraid that some other countries in Africa, such as Malawi, Tanzania and
Zambia, may face the same danger [71,72].

5 Conclusion and Discussion

In this article, we propose a network epidemic model for HIV epidemics,
wherein each individual is repreasented by a node of the transmission network
and the edges are the connections between individuals along which the infec-
tion may spread. Motivated by some previous empirical studies on the pattern
of sexual contact, we set the sexual activity of each individual, measured by
its degree, is not homogeneous but obeys a power-law distribution.

17

Many infections concluding HIV/AIDS can persist in population at a very
low prevalence. This epidemiological phenomenon can not be illuminated by
previous models with homogeneous mixing hypothesis, while our model can
reproduce this feature due to the heterogeneity of activity. In addition, the
model displays a clear picture of hierarchical spread: In the early stage the
infection is adhered to these high-risk persons, and then, diﬀuses toward low-
risk population.

There are two main ingredients baﬄing the prediction obtained by dynamical
model: The ﬁrst is the lack of comprehensive and authentic data, and the sec-
ond is the existence of unexpected interventions like the governmental action
against HIV/AIDS epidemics. Right or wrong, we try to predict HIV epidemics
by using the present model, and hope it will at least capture some qualita-
tive features. The prediction results show that the development of epidemics
can be roughly categorized into three patterns for diﬀerent countries: persist
in a stable and low level after a peak in the early stage (US), monotonously
grow and then persist in a stable and low level (China), infect considerable
ratio of population. Which class the HIV epidemic of a given country ﬁnally
belongs to is mainly determined by the corresponding behavior parameters
(hki, β1). The interplay of demographic structure and HIV epidemics is also
taken into account. In most cases, the eﬀect of HIV epidemics on demographic
structure is very weak, while for some extremely countries, like Botswana, the
population size can be decpressed to a half, and the age structure will become
sandglass-like since many people in their prime of life (from aged 15 to 49)
will be killed by AIDS.

We believe this work may have some contribution in understanding the un-
derlying mechanism of HIV epidemic dynamics, since it can naturally repro-
duce some important observed characters in HIV spread that has not been
emphasized in the previous models. However, is has many shortages which
should be adverted to and may be considered in the future works. The ﬁrst is
the memory-limitation and time-complexity in simulation block the directly
studies on very large systems. Therefore, we have to use the normalization
method to mimic the real countries with huge population. This size eﬀect
may bring additional error in prediction. A recently proposed fast algorithm
[73,74] may improve the situation if we have successfully modiﬁed some dy-
namical rules and translated this model into an equal rate-equation form.
Secondly, this model consider only the heterosexual contacts and perinatal
transmission, however, other transmission routes, especially the homosexual
contacts [75,76] and sharing injectors among drug users [77,78], are also sig-
niﬁcant in HIV epidemics. Finally, some details are ignored. For example, a
recent study [79] indicates the existence of large fertility diﬀerentials between
HIV-infected and uninfected women, and some empirical studies show that
the social networks have community structure [80,81], which will aﬀect the
epidemic dynamics [82,83].

Abstract

It has been suggested that the minimization of the probability for lethal
mutations is a major constraint shaping the genetic code [1]. Indeed, the genetic
code has been found highly protective against transitions [2]. Here, we show
that data on polymerase-induced frameshifts provide a rationale for the codon
assignment of chain termination signals (CTS).

We work on the assumption that the mutational spectra of in vitro polymerization
[3]-[11] for DNA-polymerases belonging to families found in at least two of the three
living kingdoms [12] are relevant with respect to primordial polymerases. We will here
not take into account DNA polymerases beta, which are family X DNA polymerases
exclusively found among eukaryotes so far [13], and HIV-reverse transcriptases, which
are thought to be active as dimers [14] and which emerged very ‘late’ in evolution
[15].

As it is believed that RNA preceded DNA in evolution, data for RNA-replicases
would be more adapted but are not available. Recent evidence shows however that
DNA- and RNA-replicases are very closely related [16]: a single tyrosine to pheny-
lalanine substitution changes DNA-replicases into RNA-replicases [17]; E.coli DNA-
polymerase I is also an accurate RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase [18]. A single
mutation confers to the MMLV-reverse transcriptase the ability to replicate RNA
[19].

Polymerase-induced mutations are mainly substitutions and frameshifts [3]-[9].
The frameshifts’ error-rate is about half the substitutions’ error-rate for the Klenow-
polymerase domain [3], which has no nuclease domain as can be assumed for a pri-
mordial polymerase. Frameshifts result mostly from the addition or deletion of one

base [3]-[7]. Frameshifts are highly deleterious as they prevent translation in the cor-
rect reading frame of the codons downstream the mutation. They happen in directly
repeated and palindromic sequences [10] (where the assumption of polymerase-error
tolerance can be shown to be consistent) and in non-reiterated runs, where single-base
deletions occur more frequently than single-base additions [3, 4],[6],[9]. Additions will
therefore be neglected here. For polymerases with or without nuclease domains we
noticed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the consensus sequence for single-base deletion
sites in non-reiterated runs. It has been deﬁned as YR [3], TTR [11], YTG [8], TR
[10], and reﬁned here from the current data [3]-[11] as YTRV (V= C, A or G [3]).

If the genetic code has been optimized for frameshift tolerance, then it should allow
to code for most amino acid sequences without using YTRV sequences, or the TRV,
YTR and NYT potential deletion site codons (PDSC) nor using their reverse-comple-
mentary (rc) sequences which are also expected to yield deletions during replication
(Fig. 1):

If the base T is the ﬁrst base of a codon and in case the previous codon has a
pyrimidine as third codon base, then the amino acid should be encoded without using
the six codons TRV; if the base T is the second base of a codon and in case the ﬁrst
base of the following codon is C, A or G, then the amino acid should be encoded
without using the codons YTR; if the base T is the third base of a codon and in
case the following amino acid has a RVN-type codon, then the amino acid should be
encoded without using the eight codons NYT.

The most deleterious codons are TAA and TAG and their rc-sequences TTA and
CTA that are both PDSC and rc-PDSC. Deletions at codons encoding amino acids are
likely to yield non-functional proteins, as all downstream codons are not translated.
However, deletions at codons encoding CTS should result in addition of peptides to
the proteins’ carboxy-termini, thereby likely providing functional proteins. The least
deleterious eﬀects are therefore obtained by assigning the most deleterious codons to
CTS and not to amino acids. Frameshift tolerance may therefore have been the major
constraint in the codon assignment of CTS. The codons TTA and CTA encode leucine
having the highest, six-fold degeneracy. Frameshift tolerance may therefore be one of
the constraints imposing a high degeneracy to these amino acids.

We point out, however, that substitution tolerance and frameshift mutation tol-
erance are to be considered as competing constraints on the selection of an optimal
genetic code: substitution tolerance favors a code in which an amino acid is encoded
by triplets diﬀering only by single-base mutations. On the other hand, given that
single-base deletions in non-reiterated runs occur mostly on a speciﬁc template se-
quence, (YTRV), tolerance of these frameshift mutations favors a code in which amino
acids are encoded by triplets diﬀering strongly from another, so that amino acid se-
quences are more likely to be able to be coded for without using the YTRV sequences.
Our argument is based on the consideration that, for the consensus sequences, the
ratio between single-base deletions and base substitutions is much greater than in
other sequences, so that, for the assignment of speciﬁc codons, frameshift mutation
tolerance should be a stronger constraint than substitution tolerance.

2

In conclusion, these results provide an insight into the constraints yielding the
genetic code’s ﬁxation and suggest that the codon assignment of CTS may be con-
temporary with the emergence of polymerases being enzymes rather than ribozymes.
Polymerase-error tolerance arguments similar to the one presented here may be use-
ful in the investigation of alternative terrestrial or exobiological genetic codes and
possibly also for the engineering of new genetic codes.

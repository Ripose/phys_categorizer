Abstract

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often appear in clusters along the length of
a chromosome. This is due to variation in local coalescent times caused by, for example,
selection or recombination. Here we investigate whether recombination alone (within a
neutral model) can cause statistically signiﬁcant SNP clustering. We measure the extent of
SNP clustering as the ratio between the variance of SNPs found in bins of length l, and the
mean number of SNPs in such bins, σ2
l /µl = 1, for
clustered SNPs σ2
l /µl > 1. Apart from the bin length, three length scales are important
when accounting for SNP clustering: The mean distance between neighboring SNPs, ∆,
the mean length of chromosome segments with constant time to the most recent common
ancestor, ℓseg, and the total length of the chromosome, L. We show that SNP clustering is
observed if ∆ < ℓseg
L, clustering becomes independent

of the rate of recombination. We apply our results to the analysis of SNP data sets from
mice, and human chromosomes 6 and X. Of the three data sets investigated, the human X
chromosome displays the most signiﬁcant deviation from neutrality.

INTRODUCTION

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant polymorphisms in most pop-
ulations. Due to their ubiquity and stability they are useful in the diagnosis of human diseases
(ZHOU et al., 2002), detection of human disease genes (WILLEY et al., 2002), and gene map-
ping in organisms as diverse as humans (MCINNES et al., 2001), Arabidopsis thaliana (CHO
et al., 1999), and Drosophila (BERGER et al., 2001). For this reason, several large-scale SNP-
mapping projects are currently under way in eukaryotic model organisms including A. thaliana
(http://arabidopsis.org/Cereon), Drosophila (HOSKINS et al., 2001), mouse (LINDBLAD-TOH
et al., 2000), and human (INTERNATIONAL HUMAN GENOME SEQUENCING CONSORTIUM,
2001; THE INTERNATIONAL SNP MAP WORKING GROUP, 2001).

A central question in the analysis of data collected in the context of these projects is how SNPs

1

are distributed along a chromosome and what inferences about selection might be drawn from
this distribution. This question can be addressed at the level of individual polymorphisms (FAY
et al., 2001) or at the level of the whole genome (LINDBLAD-TOH et al., 2000).

LINDBLAD-TOH et al. (2000) have observed that SNPs cluster along chromosomes in mice.
This clustering may either be due to variation in local mutation rates, or variation in local coa-
lescent times. The hypothesis of local differences in mutation rates in mice was rejected, leaving
differences in local coalescent times as the most likely explanation of SNP clustering. In the
case of the mouse genome such variation in coalescent times may be due to selection in the wild
or selection for unusual coat colors (c.f. breeding of ‘fancy’ mice in the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries). Another possibility mentioned is the effect of inbreeding (LINDBLAD-TOH
et al., 2000).

On the other hand, recombination alone leads to ﬂuctuations in the time to the most recent com-
mon ancestor along a chromosome (HUDSON, 1990). Since time to the most recent common
ancestor is proportional to the number of SNPs found in the respective chromosome segment,
recombination in a neutral model might be sufﬁcient to account for genome-wide SNP cluster-
ing.

A well established stochastic model for neutral genetic variation is the constant-rate mutation
coalescent process under the inﬁnite-sites model. According to this model, the total number
of SNPs found in a sample is expected to be Poisson distributed with parameter λ = θTtot/2,
where Ttot is the total time to the most recent common ancestor, θ = 4Neu, u is the probability
of mutation per site per generation, and Ne is the effective population size (see HUDSON (1990)
for a review). This is a global property of any contiguous stretch of DNA, and holds in the
absence of recombination, where all sites have the same genealogy (and thus the total time Ttot
to the most recent common ancestor is constant along the chromosome). In the presence of
recombination, the number of polymorphisms conditional on the genealogies of all sites is still
Poisson distributed with parameter

L

θ
2 Z
0

dx Ttot(x) .

(1)

Here x denotes the position on, and L the length of the chromosome. Since the value of param-
eter (1) ﬂuctuates between samples, the total number of SNPs is no longer Poisson distributed,
except in the case of very frequent recombination where the variance of this parameter tends
to zero. These properties of the coalescent are reviewed in HUDSON (1990). For more recent
reviews see NORDBORG (2001) and NORDBORG and TAVA ´E (2002).

In this paper we investigate local SNP statistics: local spatial ﬂuctuations in Ttot(x) due to re-
combination (HUDSON, 1990) may give rise to local variations in the SNP density. Here we
study the implications of this idea for the analysis of experimental SNP data.

Speciﬁcally, we address the following ﬁve questions. How signiﬁcant is SNP clustering caused
by recombination? How does the clustering depend on the parameters of the model (the sample
size, the mutation rate, and the recombination rate)? On which length scales are such clusters
expected? How does the clustering depend on the length scale on which it is observed? Finally,
can recombination alone account for the clustering of SNPs observed in mice (LINDBLAD-TOH
et al., 2000), or in the human genome (THE INTERNATIONAL SNP MAP WORKING GROUP,
2001)? In the following these questions are answered by analyzing coalescent simulations.

MODEL AND METHODS

We use coalescent simulations under the neutral inﬁnite-sites model to generate allele samples
(HUDSON, 1990; NORDBORG, 2001). As usual, this model incorporates mutation (with rate
θ = 4Neu) and reciprocal recombination (with rate R = 4Ner, where r is the probability of a
recombination event per generation per sequence).

The coalescent process generates genealogies for all sites of the n sequences in a given sample.
In the absence of recombination, these genealogies are identical for all sites x. In particular,
the total time to the most recent common ancestor Ttot is the same for all sites. For a given
genealogy, mutations are generated as a Poisson process with rate λ = θTtot/2. This implies
that the density of SNPs along the genome is uniform: in this case SNPs do not cluster.

If the recombination rate is non-zero, the total time to the most recent common ancestor, Ttot(x),
varies as a function of the position x (HUDSON, 1990). This corresponds to ﬂuctuating local
mutation rates λ(x) = θ Ttot(x)/2. In the presence of recombination, the distribution of SNPs
is thus determined by a Poisson process in x with ﬂuctuating rates λ(x). Figure 1 shows such a
process for realizations of λ(x) corresponding to three different sets of parameter values. The
ﬂuctuating rates λ(x) are shown as solid lines. Note that λ(x) is constant over segments of the
chromosome which are identical by descent (called MRCA segments in the following). The
ﬁgure illustrates possible local clustering of SNPs as a consequence of local variation in λ(x)
due to recombination. While the density of SNPs in the top and bottom panels is uniform, the
middle panel exhibits clustering in regions of high λ(x).

In the remainder of this paper, the local clustering such as that exhibited in the middle panel of
Figure 1 is described quantitatively. It is customary in experimental SNP surveys to count SNPs
in bins of length l. Such a bin might, for example, correspond to a sequence tagged site (STS),
or some arbitrarily chosen stretch of sequence. The mean number of SNPs per bin is then

sequence of SNPs. In other words, σ2
l /µl measures the “compressibility” of the sequence of
SNPs: the larger σ2

l /µl, the more signiﬁcant SNP clustering is on scales l and larger.

To meaningfully speak about SNP clustering, it is necessary that ∆ is much smaller than L.
This is the case considered in the following. In addition, we assume that bins are much shorter
than the chromosome on which they are placed, i.e., we make the following assumptions

and

It is clear (Figure 1) that the statistical properties of σ2
l /µl crucially depend on how rapidly the
rate λ(x) ﬂuctuates as a function of x. It is convenient to deﬁne a length scale ℓseg as the ratio
of L and the (average) number of jumps of λ(x) along the total length of the chromosome. This
length scale corresponds to the average MRCA segment length in Figure 1. Here the average
is over the chromosome for a given realization of λ(x) as well as over an ensemble of such
realizations; ℓseg depends on the recombination rate R, the sample size n, and L (GRIFFITHS
and MARJORAM, 1997). The relative sizes of the mean spacing ∆ between neighboring SNPs,
of the bin size l, the chromosome length L, and of the average MRCA segment length ℓseg will
play a crucial role in determining SNP clustering.

In the following section, we analyze local SNP clustering in the model described above. We
determine the signiﬁcance of the four length scales ∆, l, ℓseg, and L for the statistics of the ob-
servable σ2
l /µl and analyze for which parameter values θ, R, and on which length scales SNP
clustering due to recombination is expected to be most signiﬁcant. In the ﬁnal section, we dis-
cuss the implications of our results in relation to genome-wide surveys of SNPs in mice and
humans.

ANALYSIS OF SNP CLUSTERING
Characterization of the spatial ﬂuctuations of λ(x): For a given genealogy under the neu-
tral inﬁnite-sites model with recombination SNPs are distributed according to an inhomoge-
neous Poisson process, that is, according to a Poisson process with a rate λ(x) varying along
the chromosome (see Figures 1b and c). Given the function λ(x), the probability of observing
n(l) = k SNPs in bin [0, l] is

Moreover, given the function λ(x), counts of SNPs in non-overlapping bins are statistically in-
dependent.

Theoretical predictions are computed as ensemble averages over random genealogies, corre-
sponding to averages over random functions λ(x). These ensemble averages introduce corre-
lations in the combined process. Such correlations may be weak, but they can be long-ranged.
Their range is determined by the length scale on which the random rate λ(x) varies. As Figure 1
shows, λ(x) is a piecewise constant function: along an MRCA segment the rate is constant, and
varies between MRCA segments. The three panels in Figure 1 correspond to the three cases

Ttot pertaining to two loci in an m-locus model decay according to C −1 for large values of
C (here C is the recombination rate between those loci). Identifying C with an effective re-
combination rate Reﬀ = xR/L (where R is the recombination rate between the ends of the
chromosome) one concludes that C(x) decays as x−1 for large x. In summary, for any ﬁnite
value of R, correlations between local mutation rates are large on scales up to ℓseg, and decay
for larger distances. These correlations may affect the ﬂuctuations of σ2

as, for example, the variance in the number of loci that differ between pairs of haplotypes in

other cases, however, the bins were randomly distributed over the chromosome (LINDBLAD-

SNP clustering: We have determined the ﬂuctuations of σ2
l /µl using coalescent simulations
for sample size n = 2, proceeding in ﬁve steps: (1) generate a large number of samples of
sequence pairs of length L [the results discussed below correspond to values of L ranging be-
tween 106 and 1.6 108bp]; (2) determine the SNPs within each sample (each pair of sequences);
(3) assign the SNPs to contiguous bins as illustrated in Figure 2; (4) calculate σ2
l /µl for each
sample; (5) ﬁnally, average over samples.

In these coalescent simulations, the bin size l was taken to be much smaller than L, correspond-
ing to, say the length of an STS compared to that of a mouse chromosome. Figure 3a shows
the results of coalescent simulations in comparison with eqs. (11) and (14). In keeping with the
above discussion, eq. (11) is adequate when ℓseg is much smaller than L. In this regime, the
ﬂuctuations of σ2
l /µl are small (but ﬁnite since Nbins = L/l is ﬁnite). As ℓseg approaches L,
eqs. (11) and (14) are inappropriate, and the ﬂuctuations increase signiﬁcantly, as expected.

Three qualitative observations emerge from our simulations:

1. in the region ∆ < ℓseg

2. for small values of l, σ2

l /µl exhibits a plateau for intermediate values of ℓseg (indicated by

These qualitative observations can be understood as follows.

larger than this length. In short: the dependence of σ2
l /µl on l indicates on which length scales
clustering of SNPs occurs.

DATA ANALYSIS

In the following we discuss the implications of our analysis for the interpretation of SNP data
from mouse and human. In both cases we ask whether the neutral model can be rejected.

Mouse data:
In their survey of SNPs in mice, LINDBLAD-TOH et al. (2000) observed that
SNPs were not distributed uniformly across the genome. A possible explanation for this is
selective breeding, which has certainly taken place in the recent evolution of the mice strains
investigated. On the other hand, the SNP clustering in mice might also be due to recombination
alone.
Figure 4 shows the empirically determined value of σ2
l /µl [for M. m. domesticus SNPs, see
LINDBLAD-TOH et al. (2000)] in comparison with coalescent simulations for
/µl. L was
taken to be 1.6 108bp, corresponding to the average chromosome length. A value for ℓseg can be
estimated from the average recombination rate in mice, approximately 0.5 cM/Mb (NACHMAN
and CHURCHILL, 1992). Here we assume an effective population size Ne = 10000. The
average bin length l is the average length of the sequence tagged sites investigated, i.e. 118bp,
smaller than ∆. SNP clustering on the scale of l is thus expected to be small. Moreover,
since l is much smaller than ℓseg,
/µl is expected to exhibit a plateau as a function of ℓseg,
/µl = 1.12. While the plateau is found in the simulations (Figure 4), the empirically
at
determined value of σ2
l /µl =
1.47). This increase of σ2
l /µl above the value expected under neutrality is consistent with the
earlier conclusion that selection plays an important role in shaping the genome-wide distribution
of polymorphisms in mice (LINDBLAD-TOH et al., 2000). In order to demonstrate this more
conclusively, long-range SNP data would be of great interest for two reasons: (1) the larger
l, the larger deviations from Poisson statistics are expected (ideally, l would be of the order of
ℓseg). Figure 4 shows the increase in neutral SNP clustering if l is increased to 5kb. (2) Selection
may act on length scales greater than ℓseg and may thus contribute only weakly at very small
values of l such as those corresponding to an average STS.

as suggested above. Furthermore, the empirical value for σ2
l /µl (labeled (1) in Figure 5a) lies
signiﬁcantly above the values for the neutral inﬁnite-sites model with recombination [the corre-
sponding value of ℓseg was estimated assuming an effective population size of Ne = 10000 and
a recombination rate of 1 cM/Mb (PRITCHARD and PRZEWORSKI, 2001)]. This deviation is
possibly caused by selection: the HLA system, which contains more than 100 genes and spans
more than 4 Mb on the short arm of chromosome 6 (KLEIN et al., 1993), has an exceptionally
high SNP density. This is maintained by balancing selection (THE INTERNATIONAL SNP MAP
WORKING GROUP, 2001; O’HUIGIN et al., 2000). The inset of Figure 5a shows the empiri-
cally determined distribution of the number of SNPs per bin P (n(l) = k). It exhibits a strong
tail for large values of k, which may be due to selection. By ignoring this tail the estimate
(labeled (2) in Figure 5a) for σ2
l /µl is reduced considerably. Given the uncertainty as to which
value of ℓseg should be assigned to the data points, one may argue that this second estimate is

≪

consistent with the neutral inﬁnite-sites model.

Human X chromosome: Finally, Figure 5b shows the empirical estimate of σ2
l /µl given
l = 200kb for the X chromosome. This empirical estimate was reduced by discarding the
tail in the distribution P (n(l) = k) for large k as was done in the analysis of the chromosome 6
data. However, both estimates of SNP clustering on the human X chromosome deviated signif-
icantly from neutrality. This observation is consistent with the fact that due to its hemizygosity
in males chromosome X should be affected more by selection than autosomes such as chromo-
some 6.

DISCUSSION

In this paper we investigate whether the observations of SNP clustering in mice and humans are
compatible with neutral expectations. We chose the variance in the number of SNPs found in
equal-length contiguous divided by the mean number of SNPs found in each bin as a measure
of SNP clustering: σ2
l /µl. Since under a Poisson distribution the variance is equal to the mean,
l /µl = 1 in the absence of recombination. If SNPs are clustered, σ2
σ2
Whether or not SNP clustering is signiﬁcant depends on the relative sizes of the mean spacing
between neighboring SNPs, ∆, the mean length of segments with constant time to the most re-
cent common ancestor, ℓseg, and the total length of the chromosome, L. Speciﬁcally, clustering
is observed if ∆ < ℓseg
L. In contrast, if recombination is either very frequent compared to
mutation (ℓseg

L), no clustering is observed3.

∆) or very rare (ℓseg

l /µl > 1.

We have shown that it is essential to consider the effect of the scale on which SNPs are sampled,
l. In our simulations l describes the length of contiguous non-overlapping bins. This length is
short compared to the length of the chromosome, and the corresponding large number of such
bins leads to narrow conﬁdence intervals around σ2
l for the biologically relevant parameters. As
a result, meaningful comparisons between model and observation can be made. In the case of
the mouse, the neutral model is rejected with marginal signiﬁcance. This conclusion depends
on the assumption of a “true” recombination rate for mice. This is difﬁcult to know, but Figure
(4) shows that our hypothesis test is quite robust with respect to errors in the estimation of R
(and hence ℓseg).

In the case of human chromosome 6, the inﬂuence of l on the outcome of the neutrality test was
striking. Signiﬁcant SNP clustering was observed for large but not for small l (Figure 5a). For
large bins (l = 200 kb) the distribution of the number of SNPs per bin had a strong positive
skew (Figure 5a, inset). By cutting off the tail of bins containing many SNPs, clustering was
reduced to its neutral level.

No such effect of cutting off the tail of SNP-dense bins was observed for the X-chromosome.
It therefore constitutes the most signiﬁcantly non-neutral SNP collection among the three data
sets investigated in this study.

Factors that might lead to such a rejection of the neutral model include population expansion,

3Rather than the recombination rate R we use the corresponding length scale ℓseg as our point of reference for
discussing SNP clustering; ℓseg can directly be compared to the other length scales of the problem, viz. the length
of the bins in which SNPs are sampled in experiments, l, as well as ∆, and L. Moreover, equation (8) shows
that ℓseg is a simple function of L, R, and the sample size n, thereby establishing the link between simulations
conditioned on R and our observations.

population subdividion, and variation in (physical) mutation rate. In the case of the data sets we
have investigated, some illuminating biology pertaining to these factors is known. LINDBLAD-
TOH et al. (2000) tested whether unequal physical mutation rates could account for their ob-
servation of SNP clustering in mice. Their approach was to resequence 16 STSs with no SNPs
and 16 STSs with ﬁve or more SNPs from closely related species of mice. They observed that
the classiﬁcation of high-scoring and low-scoring STSs was not reproduced in these other taxa
and concluded from this that ﬂuctuations in inherent mutation rates could not account for the
observation of signiﬁcant SNP clustering. The claim that selective breeding has been important
in shaping the SNP distribution in mice is plausible, but other factors such as population expan-
sion and subdivision can presumably not be ruled out.

The situation is slightly different in the case of human chromosomes 6 and X, where deviation
from the neutral model was much more pronounced for the sex chromosome than for the au-
tosome. Since all chromosomes have undergone the same history of population expansion and
migration, selection seems to be the only explanation for this difference. The hemizygosity in
males of the X-chromosome, which makes most deleterious mutations dominant in males, ﬁts
well with this conclusion.

Abstract

The random map model is a deterministic dynamical system in a ﬁnite phase
space with n points. The map that establishes the dynamics of the system is
constructed by randomly choosing, for every point, another one as being its
image. We derive here explicit formulas for the statistical distribution of the
number of attractors in the system. As in related results, alas, the number
of operations involved by our formulas increases exponentially with n; therefore,
they are not directly applicable to study the behavior of systems where n is large.
However, our formulas lend themselves to derive useful asymptotic expressions,
as we show.

1. Introduction

Since the 70’s the random map model has attracted the attention of physicists
in the realm of theoretical biology, disordered systems, and cellular automata,
for its possible application to studies of DNA replication, cell diﬀerentiation, and
evolution theory [1

4].

−

On the other hand, one half of a century ago, some mathematicians had ap-
proached the random map model in the context of random graphs. First, in
1953, Metropolis & Ulam posed the problem of determining the number Θ(n)
of expected connected components (i.e., attractors) in random graphs with n
nodes [5]; at the time, Θ(n) was estimated to be of order log n. Only one year
later, Kruskal elegantly solved the problem obtaining an exact formula together
with its corresponding asymptotic behavior [6]:

(1.2)

where ǫ vanishes for n

, and γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

The statistical distribution of the number of connected components was ad-
dressed both by Rubin & Sitgreaves [7], and Folkert in his Ph.D. thesis under
Leo Katz supervision [8]. Unfortunately, these two practically out of reach works
were never published even though their relevance and an oﬀer by Katz to do
so [9]. Later on, Harris partially reviewed and enlarged these results, proposing a
new combinatorial expression for the distribution of connected components [10].
The mathematical expressions found by Folkert and Harris, however correct, are
based on constrained sums with a number of terms of order en, and involve Stir-
ling numbers of the ﬁrst kind [11,12]. Therefore, alas, their straightforward use in
physics or biology appears quite limited (for example, it is typical to deal with
n

2100 in models such as those of cellular automata).

∼

In spite of its importance, and as far as we know, a study of the variance for the
distribution of connected components has not yet been undertaken.

In this paper we propose a still new combinatorial formula —equivalent to the
previous ones, of course— for the statistical distribution of the number of con-
nected components. As in earlier results, it also relies on a constrained sum, and
the involved computational eﬀort increases exponentially with n. Nevertheless,
it has the advantage of allowing us the derivation of the long-needed asymptotic
formula for the statistical distribution. Furthermore, we easily deduce from it
asymptotic formulas for the corresponding average and variance.

2

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the main deﬁnitions
of the random map model, and to settle our conventions. Then, in Section 3, we
determine an exact combinatorial expression for the statistical distribution of the
number of connected components in the model. The corresponding asymptotic
formula for this distribution is derived in Section 4, as well as asymptotic formulas
for the average and the variance for the number of connected components. To
end, we present our conclusions in Section 5.

2. The Random Map Model and Functional Graphs

{

1, 2, . . . , n

Let Ω =
be a set of n points. To each point in Ω assign at random
one point in Ω with uniform probability distribution, thus deﬁning a function
Ω. In this way a dynamical system has been established on the so-called
f : Ω
phase space Ω through the iterations of f ; this is the random map model [3,4].

→

}

Since Ω is ﬁnite every orbit of f will eventually end in a periodic attractor, and
several questions are in order, like: what is the expected number of attractors
in the system? which is the statistical distribution of the number of attractors?
how large is the dispersion of the distribution? Here, we answer these questions
starting from combinatorial arguments.

For each function f on Ω deﬁne a functional graph whose nodes are precisely
the elements of Ω; moreover, if f (i) = j then draw a directed link from node i
to node j, and whenever f (i) = i a loop on node i is drawn. As an example,
Figure 1 shows a functional graph with three connected components (i.e., three
attractors) in a set with n = 11.

×

n binary matrix M =

Note that each function f on Ω (or functional graph) can be represented by an
, where Mij = 1 whenever f (i) = j and Mij = 0
n
otherwise. Every row of matrix M has n
1 zeros and one ‘1’. Clearly, there
exist nn such matrices, and thus nn is the number of functions f that can be
deﬁned on Ω, as well as the number of distinct functional graphs on n nodes.

3. The Distribution of Connected Components

What is the number an of connected functional graphs (i.e., having precisely one
connected component) that can be found among the nn functional graphs on n
nodes? Through clever combinatorial arguments Katz obtained [9]

Using (3.1) we derive now a novel expression for the statistical distribution of the
number of connected components in functional graphs. Consider ﬁrst a partition
of Ω, in k disjoint subsets Ω1, . . . , Ωk, with n1, . . . , nk points, respectively; then

Obviously,

nomial coeﬃcient
nk! yields the number of distinct ways we
can distribute n objects in distinguishable boxes B1, . . . , Bk, of sizes n1, . . . , nk,
respectively [11,13]. This leads to

Expressions (3.4) and (3.5) appear more diﬃcult to handle than (3.3) because of
the added extra terms via the summation involving Stirling numbers.

To our knowledge, the statistical moments of the distribution for the number of
connected components have not yet been obtained in closed form. Further, the
exact calculation done by Kruskal for the expected number of attractors (1.1) is
not derived from a distribution (see Ref. [6]). For application purposes (n >> 1)
it is then worthwhile to derive manageable asymptotic formulas for ρn(k); this
is the subject of the next section.

Constraint (3.3a) can be broken by introducing a Kronecker delta inside the
summation. Using the integral representation

where Γ is any closed contour in the complex plane of z such that the origin is
inside, we go back to the expression for ρn(k) to obtain

with a modicum of algebra, where

as an alternate way to compute ρn(k).

The computation of (4.4) may be as diﬃcult as that of (3.3); however, the former
is manageable for n >> 1, as we shall see. First note that (4.4b) does not

depend on the particular value we give to p in (4.4a), as long as p

a polynomial of degree nk, and its n-th derivative may be calculated in terms
of ﬁnite diﬀerences with the help of Stirling numbers (see formulas (A.6) in
Appendix A), obtaining

Conclusion

We have proposed a novel and simpler expression for the distribution of the
number of attractors in the random map model (Eq. (3.3)). The number of
operations involved for the numerical evaluation of the distribution grows expo-
nentially with n, thus making expression (3.3) useless for direct calculations for
n >> 1. To overcome this diﬃculty, however, we have derived an asymptotic
formula (Eq. (4.14)), from which we directly deduced asymptotic values both for
the average number of attractors and for its variance (Eqs. (4.15) and (4.16),
resp.).

In the random map model, additional statistical ﬁgures are of interest. Among
them, the average attractor size, the average period (or average length) of the
cycles; also, given a point x in the phase space, the expected length of its orbit,
the expected length of the cycle in the attractor containing x, the expected
number of points from which x can be attained, etc. Some of these ﬁgures have
already been computed (for example, see Ref. [2,3,10]), and others are subject of
recent studies [16].

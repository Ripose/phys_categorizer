Abstract

All types of blood cells are formed by diﬀerentiation from a small self-

maintaining population of pluri-potential stem cells in the bone marrow. De-

spite abundant information on the molecular aspects of division, diﬀerentia-

tion, commitment and maturation of these cells, comparatively little is known

about the dynamics of the system as a whole, and how it works to maintain

this complex “ecology” in the observed normal ranges throughout life. Here

we report unexpected large, scale-free, ﬂuctuations detected from the ﬁrst

long-term analysis of the day-to-day variability of a healthy animal’s blood

cell counts measured over one thousand days. This scale-invariance cannot

be accounted for by current theoretical models, and resembles some of the

scenarios described for self-organized criticality.

The existence of scale-invariant ﬂuctuations in nature is well-documented [1]. Scale-

invariance refers [1,2] to the absence of a single time or length scale characteristic of the

(temporal or spatial) pattern of change. In such cases ﬂuctuations happen at all scales, unlike

the more familiar cases in which there is a simple statistical spread around a deﬁned mean

value. Scale-invariance has been shown for ﬂuctuations in heart rate [3], gait dynamics [4],

DNA nucleotide sequences [5], and lung inﬂation [6]. How these ﬂuctuations are generated

by regulatory physiological mechanisms and what their relevance is in biology is the focus of

much current interest. In addition, it has been argued that scale-invariance in itself can be

the ﬁngerprint of a biological system poised at a critical state, resulting in improved dynamics

with robust tolerance to error, and at the same time remaining very susceptible to change

[7]. Roughly speaking, this idea of self-organized criticality as a homeostatic mechanism is

that systems with many interacting non-linear parts could ﬁnd themselves moving toward

the critical state (i.e. “self-organizing”) simply because it would be absolutely impractical to

administer it in any centralized way. Here we show that the regulation of the number of the

formed elements in blood also has scale-invariant properties. We found that the day-to-day

variability in the number of platelets (PLA), red (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) from

two healthy sheep observed for one thousand days is scale-invariant over a range spanning

from a few to over two hundred days.

Even in healthy subjects [8,9] the number of blood cells ﬂuctuates from one day to the

next. Health practitioners are very aware of this fact, to the point that these quantities are

usually described as ranges or maximal limits and not as means and standard deviations.

In other words, for these variables normality could be deﬁned in one sense as “ﬂuctuations

within a normal range”. Figure 1 shows the daily values (over 1000 days) for blood cells

taken from two healthy sheep. Overall, the values observed are consistent with the normal

range reported [10] in the literature for these animals. Simple inspection of the data reveals

fast, medium and slow ﬂuctuations, and a certain degree of correlation in the behaviour of

the time series between the animals, as if they were responding in a similar way to some

common external factor. What is the nature of the extensive ﬂuctuations seen in all the series

2

plotted in Figure 1? According to current understanding [8], homeostatic mechanisms act

to compensate the loss of a given number of cells by speeding up the process of maturation

of precursors, i.e., there is a negative feedback loop attempting to maintain constant the

number of blood cells. The precise characterization of the observed ﬂuctuations is important

in assessing the adequacy of current models, because much is known about the dynamics

which regulatory mechanisms of this kind are capable of exhibiting [8]. Thus one could

reject or accept classes of models, or propose the need for novel ones, depending on the type

of ﬂuctuations found experimentally.

The dynamics of any underlying control process is expected to be reﬂected in the temporal

correlation between the data points; this is the physiologically important information we are

interested in. We consider here two extreme (null) hypotheses: the ﬁrst is to assume a tight

feedback mechanism perturbed by some jitter where one should simply see a mean value

contaminated with white noise. The second corresponds to the very unlikely case that no

control is exerted to compensate for blood cell losses, resulting in a random walk motion,

in which the ﬂuctuation is just generated by the day-by-day summation of statistically

independent increments or decrements. To compare our observed time series against these

two possibilities, surrogate data sets were constructed to mimic the null hypotheses cited

above.

In Figure 2, the raw time series of red blood cells of one animal is plotted in the top

panel. Panels denoted S1 and S2 depict the surrogate series of the ﬁrst and second types

respectively. The ﬁrst one (S1) is constructed by re-ordering at random the raw values of the

top panel, like shuﬄing a deck of cards. In this way, any temporal relationship between the

counts on one day and the next in the original data is broken, and the resulting time series

is white noise. Surrogate S2 is built by (1) generating an accessory ﬁle with the day-to-day

diﬀerences of the raw data in the top panel; (2) randomizing the order of the data points

from this accessory ﬁle, and (3) integrating the result over the whole length of the ﬁle to

synthesize a new time series. Surrogate type 2 is therefore a random walk-like signal. By

using diﬀerent random orderings, one can build many examples or realizations of these types

3

of surrogates.

To quantify the characteristics of the temporal correlations in the data we use detrended

ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [11]. This method has been used successfully to analyze biological

time series, circumventing some technical diﬃculties, such as trends and non-stationarities.

The DFA algorithm involves the following steps: 1) Denoting Cj as the blood cell daily

count of interest on the j−th day, produce a new time-integrated series yi = Pi

j=1(Cj − Cav),

where Cav is the average of all Cj. 2) The new series yi is subsequently divided into boxes

of equal length n, and in each box a least-squares line is ﬁtted to the data, representing the

trend over the chosen time interval. 3) Deﬁne and calculate F (n) as the square root of the

mean of the squares of the residuals in all boxes of length n for a given value of n. Thus,

F (n) quantiﬁes the magnitude of the ﬂuctuation of the integrated and detrended time series

over increasingly long time intervals. The presence of a straight line of slope α in the log-log

plot of F(n) vs. n implies a relationship of the type F (n) ∝ nα . The range of n over which

this relationship holds deﬁnes the time span over which the ﬂuctuations are scale-invariant.

The two extreme cases considered have expected values of α = 0.5 for white noise, and 1.5

for a random-walk motion.

Panel a in Fig. 3 is a log-log plot of F(n) vs. n resulting from the analysis of the red cells

data set plotted in Fig. 2. Symbols on the right of the ﬁgure indicate to which time series the

calculated function belongs, R denoting the raw time series, and S1 and S2 the 30 random

realizations of surrogates 1 and 2 respectively. The plot for the raw data is approximately

linear over time lags n from 1-200 days, indicating that blood cell count ﬂuctuations are

scale-invariant. We found similar scaling behaviour in all series in both sheep. The lines of

best ﬁt gave slopes α = 0.98 and 1.00 for RBC, α = 1.24 and 1.11 for PLA, and α = 0.83 and

0.83 for WBC (sheep 77 and 78 respectively). The lowest value of the correlation coeﬃcient

r for all raw data series was 0.995. Panel b in Figure 3 illustrates an important consequence

of scale-invariance: on increasing the observation time by a factor of k the ﬂuctuations are

found to be kα larger, that is to say the longer we look the bigger the range of values we

will ﬁnd.

4

Additional insight can be gained by applying standard spectral analysis techniques to

the same series.

In this case, it is appropriate to consider the spectral analysis of the

daily diﬀerences (i.e, Cj − Cj−1) of the time series, since this is of a stationary nature by

construction. We computed the power spectra S(f ) of each diﬀerentiated time series and

in all cases we found that the square of their amplitudes scales as S(f ) ∼ f β . The scaling

factors α and β are related [1] as β = 3 − 2α. The values obtained via spectral analysis

(for sheep 77 and 78) were β = 0.97 and 0.91 for RBC, (the values predicted from α are

1.04 and 1.00 respectively); for PLA β = 0.65 and 0.70 (predicted values of 0.52 and 0.78

respectively); and for WBC β = 1.14 and 1.16 (1.34 and 1.34 respectively). There is clear

agreement between the scaling exponents obtained using both methods.

The value of β provides additional information regarding the nature of the process,

because 0 < β < 1 implies that a high value is more likely to be follow by a small value

and viceversa, i.e., there is anti-correlation between values collected on successive days. The

fact that we found a wide range (1- 200 days) over which this scaling factor holds, indicate

that the mechanism responsible for the anti- correlated dynamics operates at all time scales,

something that a regulatory system as a simple negative feedback-like loop is incapable of

doing.

We must therefore reject the two null hypotheses considered. The fact that the data is

not white is surprising, since this is the most likely possibility if there is simple feedback

control such as that postulated to relate erythropoietin production and erythrocyte number.

The fact that the data is not a random walk does at least suggest that control is present, and

that it is non-trivial. Substantial work exists regarding the architecture of haematopoietic

regulation, including the seminal work of Mackey [8] but interestingly enough no model

has as yet reproduced the scale-invariance reported here. We suspect that an important

part of the ﬂuctuations we have observed reﬂects genuine intrinsic dynamics of the system,

which possesses a very large number of parts. To account for these observations, models

which preserve this very large number of degrees of freedom are needed. The behaviour here

reported for sheep has also been suggested [12] to be present in human neutrophil counts,

5

albeit using a far shorter time series than ours. To show that this type of scale invariance

is indeed present in humans without going to the extreme of daily sampling, it could be

possible to collect data from many individuals who have been subject to blood sampling

and counting on at least two occasions a known number of days, months or years apart and

estimating a similar ﬂuctuation function. This could be achieved for example in records of

regular blood donors, and will estimate the likelihood of encountering a given diﬀerence as a

function of time lag. At present no information exists which health practitioners can use to

forecast such simple physiological parameters in situations of interest such as bone marrow

transplant.

If our results hold in humans, one important consequence of scale invariance is to make

it diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate between the response to a given treatment and a chance value due

to the intrinsic (scale-invariant) nature of this type of ﬂuctuations, especially if the patient

is seen at long intervals. Health practitioners generally make clinical decisions on the basis

of isolated data points, it being implicit that waiting longer or taking more samples can only

reduce the variance. Our ﬁndings imply exactly the opposite; waiting longer increases the

variance!

(identiﬁed as sheep 77 and 78). The erythrocyte (panel a), platelet (panel b), and leukocyte (panel c) time

series of both sheep are depicted. For clarity the series corresponding to sheep 77, have been shifted upward

by 15% (red), 50% (platelet) and 100% (white) of their mean values. Data was collected from two castrated

male sheep, one year old at the beginning of data collection, fed ad- libitum and housed in individual pens,

diagnosed as healthy during the period by our in-house veterinarians. A few ml of blood were extracted

every morning from the jugular vein over 1000 consecutive days and red cells, platelets and white blood cells

were counted using a manual (non- automatic) procedure.

depicted in the upper panel. Bottom panels denoted S1 and S2 correspond to two examples of potential

processes (i.e., the null hypotheses) which could give rise to the observed ﬂuctuations. The surrogate type

1 time series is built by randomly re-ordering the raw data, thus assuming a mean value contaminated with

white noise having a similar density to the raw data. Surrogate type 2 preserves the day-to-day increments,

and is built by re-ordering and integrating the day-to-day red cell count diﬀerences, therefore resulting in a

random walk-like signal. Simple inspection reveals that the dynamics of the raw data lies between the two

surrogates, departing from the mean value signiﬁcantly less than the S2 surrogate (which is representative

of a random walk signal) but more than the S1 signal.

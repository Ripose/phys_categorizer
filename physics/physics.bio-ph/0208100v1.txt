We investigate a statistical model for multidimensional epistasis. The genotype is devided into
subsequences, and within each subsequence mutations which occur in a prescribed order are beneﬁ-
cial. The bit-string model used to represent the genotype, may be cast in the form of a ferromagnetic
Ising model with a staggered ﬁeld. We obtain the actual correlations between mutations at diﬀerent
sites, within an equilibrium population at a given tolerance, which we deﬁne to be the temperature
of the statistical ensemble.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Although evolution takes place via a combination of
random mutations and natural selection, it seems to pro-
ceed rather rapidly along directed paths in the space of
It is a challenging problem
all possible genetic states.
to try to understand the mechanisms which lead to this
phenomenon [1].

Eigen has pointed out that each “species” actually con-
sists of a more or less narrow distribution in the phase
space of all possible genetic states, and this distribution
may shift, in response to environmental pressure [4]. Nat-
ural selection in response to environmental factors is usu-
ally modelled in terms of a “ﬁtness function” which is a
measure of the survival probability and/or reproductive
capability of the individual.

Those mutations which have a salutary eﬀect on the ﬁt-
ness persist in the population and lead to new variants;
other, neutral mutations may simply be carried along
since they do not aﬀect the well being of the individ-
ual. Deleterious mutations usually aﬀect the organism
adversely, and the accumulation of too many will reduce
the ﬁtness drastically.

The simplest hypothesis biologists have adopted re-
garding how the number of mutations aﬀect the ﬁtness,
is that each deleterious mutation reduces the ﬁtness by
an identical factor, say 1/a, a > 1. This is equivalent to
assuming that the eﬀect of each deleterious mutation is
independent of the others, or that there is no “epistasis”
between the mutations, and leads to a ﬁtness function
which decays exponentially with m, the number of mu-
tations, as f ∼ exp(−αm), where α = ln a. [6] A diﬀerent
type of assumption can be made, to take f to depend on
m in a step-wise fashion, so that the value of f is un-
aﬀected for m less than a threshold, after which it is
reduced drastically. [7]

It is clear, however, that there can be epistatic inter-
actions between mutations at diﬀerent points on the ge-
netic string and that the expression of unmutated genes
may be aﬀected by the presence of mutations at certain
loci, and so on. [8] Therefore f may depend not only on
the total number of mutations, but also on their loca-
tion, and may also increase as the result of mutations at
It has recently been pointed out that the
certain loci.

ﬁtness may depend strongly on the order in which cer-
tain mutations may occur [2]. As a case in point, for a
mutation leading to a certain modiﬁcation to be bene-
ﬁcial, one must already have had a mutation leading to
the emergence of a feature which will beneﬁt from this
modiﬁcation.

This type of epistasis actually lends itself to a treat-
ment in terms of statistical equilibria, with the appropri-
ate choice of a ﬁtness function. [3]

In this paper we will represent a complete genomic se-
quence with epistatic interactions by a one dimensional
feromagnetic Ising model. We will subdivide the total
genotype into subsequences (here taken to be of length
2, without any loss of generality), and stipulate that mu-
tations can lead to salutory eﬀects only if they occur
in a certain order within these subsequences. We will
further introduce a new quantity, the “tolerance” of the
environment, which will have to be taken into acount to
determine how strongly epistatis interactions aﬀect the
overall ﬁtness. Our aim will be to compute, within this
model, the eﬀective correlations between mutations at
diﬀerent sites, at ﬁxed tolerance, within a population at
equilibrium.

II. THE MODEL

Since Eigen ﬁrst introduced the quasi-species model [4]
bitstring models of genetic evolution have been exten-
sively studied numerically [5, 10, 11, 12].
In this ap-
proach, the genotype of an individual is represented by
a string of Boolean variables σi, i = 1, . . . N , which can
obviously be identiﬁed with a one dimensional system of
Ising spins [9]. If one takes the wild type, or the initial
genotype, to consist of a string of 0’s, each point muta-
tion is indicated by ﬂipping the bit representing a given
gene, from 0 to 1.

We would like to avail ourselves of the analytically
known results on the exactly solvable Ising model in equi-
librium, to be able to make deﬁnite predictions regarding
the correlation of mutated genes on a given genotype,
under assumptions similar to those of Kondrashov and
Kondrashov [2].

We devide the one dimensional string of spins repre-

f =

e−βH

Z

(2)

compute the relative variances vm, where

senting the state of the genome, into dimers. We demand
that the ﬁtness is only increased relative to the wild type
(all zeroes) if the bits that ﬂip to 1 occur sequentially.
[2]. Thus, within each dimer, (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1) are in
increasing order of ﬁtness while (0, 1) is less ﬁt than (0, 0).
Let us ﬁrst construct a cost function by deﬁning the

Ising Hamiltonian,

H = −J/2 X
i

sisi+1 − K X
iodd

si − H X
ieven

si

,

(1)

where for greater convenince in manipulation, we have
deﬁned the variables si = 2(σi − 1/2). The value of H
for each given sequence of {si} will serve as a cost func-
tion, in terms of which we may deﬁne the ﬁtness. No-
tice that in the ﬁrst term, we have a coupling between
nearest neighbors, which tends to reduce the “cost” for
those conﬁgurations in which the adjacent “spins”are in
the same state. If the constants, K and H, which corre-
spond to a staggered external ﬁeld in an Ising model, are
here chosen as K = 3J/4 and H = −J/4, then we ob-
tain a situation in which the dimer conﬁgurations (−1, 1),
(−1, −1), (1, −1 and (1, 1) have decreasing cost.

Then f is deﬁned as

where β is a measure of how eﬀective the cost func-
tion is in aﬀecting the ﬁtness, and Z is a normalization
factor so that f ∈ (0, 1). Note that f [{si}] can be iden-
tiﬁed as the Boltzmann factor in an equilibrium statisti-
cal model with the Hamiltonian H, at constant inverse
“temperature” β−1, and corresponds to the probablity
of observing, within an equilibrium population, the par-
ticular genotype {si}. Temperature may be seen as the
amount of randomness, or disorder in the system, com-
peting with the cost function in determining the ﬁtness.
The higher the temperature, or randomness, the weaker
will be the eﬀect of the cost function in determining the
state of the system. Therefore we deﬁne

T ≡ β−1

(3)

as the tolerance in the system. Here J is a measure of the
strength of the interaction between the states of each of
the sites (alleles), σi. Clearly, β and J will always occur
together in this model, in the product βJ, and we may
simply absorb J into the deﬁnition of β.

The ﬁtness f is normalized to take values between

(0, 1), by deﬁning

e−βH[{si}]

.

Z ≡ X
{si}

(4)

Using the transfer matrix method, this sum may be com-
puted exactly. We may then compute the expectation
values mi = hsii. Note that the quantity (mi + 1)/2
corresponds to the probability of ﬁnding a mutation on
either of the sublattices, i odd, or i even. The results

2

are shown in Fig. 1, as a function of T /J, which is the
(inverse) ration of the strength of the epistasis to the tol-
erance in the system. The “staggered magnetization,”
ms ≡ hsi (odd) − si (even)i is shown in Fig. 2, and is twice
the diﬀerence between the probabilities of encountering
a mutation on either of the two sublattices (the ﬁrst or
the second sites beloging to a dimer). It is seen to peak
sharply at small values of the tolerance, and then the
diﬀerence decays to zero, as the tolerance becomes very
large, at which point the ﬁtness function becomes essen-
tially ﬂat.

In Fig. 3a, b and c, we display the correlation func-
tions, C2 = hsisi+2i and C1 = hsisi+1i, as well as the
subtracted correlation function Cshsisi+2i − hsiihsi+2i,
as a function of T /J. It can clearly be seen here as well,
that the eﬀect of epistatic interactions in building up cor-
relations between mutated sites on the gene string, is felt
strongly within a given range of tolerances, in units of
the strength of interaction. At T = 0, since the genes are
in the ordered state with all si = 1, the excess correlation
Cs due to the interactions, is nil. In the other extreme
of very large tolerances, the system is completely disor-
dered, correlations vanish, so that the two terms in Cs
tend to each other, and both tend to zero.

To further elucidate the meaning of tolerance, we may

m ≡ h(si − mi)2i
v2

.

(5)

It is easy to see, that within a mean ﬁeld approximation,
where all the spins interact pairwise with each other, i.e.,
H = −J/N P(ij) sisj, v2
m = T /2J; thus the ratio T /J is
a measure of the size of the ﬂuctuations about the mean.
In genome space, this means pT /J is a measure of the
radius of the distribution of genotypes about the most
frequently encountred one, in equilibrium.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have cast an epistatic quasispecies
model interms of a one dimensional Ising model with
staggered magnetic ﬁeld, to give greater advantage to
certain subsequences of genes that may be mutated. We
deﬁned a “tolerance” of the system, to introduce an equi-
librium statistical ensemble, namely one whose statistical
properties do not change in time. Correlations induced
on the genetic sequence of individuals in this equlibrium
population have been computed as a function of the tol-
erance and the strength of the epistatic interaction, using
exact solutions of the Ising model in one dimension. It
has been shown that non-trivial correlations between mu-
tated sites on the gene string may arise only in a ﬁnite
range of the tolerance for a given interaction strength.

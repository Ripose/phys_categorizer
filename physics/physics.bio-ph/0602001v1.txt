Abstract: Many drug delivery systems suﬀer from undesirable interactions with the host im-
mune system. It has been experimentally established that covalent attachment (irreversible
adsorption) of suitable macromolecules to the surface of the drug carrier can reduce such unde-
sirable interactions. A fundamental understanding of the adsorption process is still lacking. In
this paper, the classical random irreversible adsorption model is generalized to capture certain
essential processes involved in pharmacological applications, allowing for macromolecules of
diﬀerent sizes, partial overlapping of the tails of macromolecules, and the inﬂuence of reactions
with the solvent on the adsorption process. Working in one dimension, an integro-diﬀerential
evolution equation for the adsorption process is derived and the asymptotic behaviour of the
surface area covered and the number of molecules attached to the surface is studied. Fi-
nally, equation-free dynamic renormalization tools are applied to study the asymptotically
self-similar behaviour of the adsorption statistics.

1 Introduction

Random sequential adsorption (RSA) is a classical model for various physical, chemical
or biological problems [5]. In the simplest form, RSA processes can be formulated as se-
quential addition to a structure of objects that cannot overlap, and once inserted, cannot
move or leave the structure [1]. In this paper, we present a pharmacological example in
which application of the RSA model can provide meaningful qualitative insights. Moti-
vated by pharmacological applications, we present a slight generalization of the classical

RSA model to enable us to study the eﬀects of polydispersity and partial overlap of
adsorbing macromolecules on the surface of a virus. We also study the dependence of
the adsorption process on interactions (reactions) of the adsorbing macromolecules with
the solvent.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will introduce the motivating
pharmacological example and our questions of interest. In Section 3, we will introduce
the generalized random sequential adsorption (gRSA) model suitable for capturing es-
sential features of the pharmacological problem from Section 2, which we formulate in
one dimension. The analytical results for this model are presented in Section 4. We
derive the governing integro-diﬀerential equation for the evolution of gaps between poly-
mers, and compute the asymptotical properties of the quantities of interest, namely the
number of macromolecules adsorbed and the total area (in one dimension, length) they
cover. In Section 5, we apply equation-free methods to the computational study of the
system. The main idea that underlies this equation-free computer-assisted analysis is the
design and execution of appropriately-initialized short bursts of stochastic simulations;
the results of these are processed to estimate coarse-grained quantities of interest - in
this case the self-similarly evolving shape of the gap statistics in the problem. Finally,
in Section 6, we discuss the higher dimensional case and summarize the connections
between the theory and the experimental data.

2 Pharmacological background

Many medical conditions such as cancer, heart disease and heritable disorders (hemophi-
lia, cystic ﬁbrosis, muscular dystrophy etc) have faulty, mutant genes as an underlying
cause. Healthy, normal genes can be readily synthesized in the laboratory but introduc-
ing them into diseased cells remains a challenge. Many research groups are studying
viruses, such as adenovirus, as a means to introduce normal genes into diseased cells.
For therapeutic use, the virus’ own DNA is usually partially or completely replaced
by the gene of interest. The most common adenovirus strain used for this purpose
is adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), because it is easy to manipulate and is non-pathogenic
in humans [14]. Ad5 has been used with great success to treat diseases in labora-
tory animals but the results have not been replicated in humans. One of the greatest
problems with using Ad5 in humans is the presence of neutralizing antibodies. In ad-
dition, the viruses often infect non-target cells, particularly the liver, causing unwanted
toxicity. Our laboratory is exploring the use of hydrophilic polymers such as poly[N-
(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (pHPMA) to coat virus particles and protect them
from neutralising antibodies by steric shielding. This technique is very eﬀective at pro-
tecting the virus and permitting it to be retargeted to speciﬁc cell types [6, 7, 12]. The
polymer has multiple esters along its length that are used to bind to the amino side
chain of lysine residues on the virus surface. In a coating reaction the polymers bind
randomly to the virus surface until (a) all of the lysine residues are occupied or (b)

2

lysine residues are rendered inaccessible (obscured) by polymer chains. We know little
about the orientation of polymers on the virus surface or how to optimise the coating
reaction because there are no techniques to visualise the orientation of polymers on the
virus surface.

Representative questions one would like to answer are: How many polymer molecules
will become attached to the viral surface by a given time? How large is the surface area
covered by the polymer coat at that time? In this paper, the theoretical approach is
chosen to address these questions for simpliﬁed models of the adsorption process. Since
the adsorption process is driven by the diﬀusion of molecules to the surface of the virus,
and since the adsorption is eﬀectively irreversible, a suitable modiﬁcation of the classical
RSA might be applied to model the process. It is important to take into account poly-
dispersity in the polymer size. Even if we prepare the polymer molecules with a speciﬁed
target molecular weight, some relatively small molecules of the polymer will always be
present, and they will diﬀuse faster than the larger molecules. A smaller molecule can
reach the surface of the virus at a higher rate. We will consider the adsorption of poly-
mers whose diameters are distributed according to a probability distribution function
P (z). The solution is assumed to be well-mixed. We also deﬁne p(z) as the probability
distribution function of the particles which can reach the surface in a single time step.
An important modelling issue lies in a good choice of P (z) (e.g. it might be the Gamma
distribution) and in a realistic relation between P (z) and p(z). In Section 3, we simply
specify p(z) (avoiding the above questions). The long term dynamics of the polydis-
perse adsorption depends on the behaviour of p(z) close to zero. We will use diﬀerent
distributions p(z) given by (3.1).

Finally, the reactive groups of the polymer molecules can also react with the solvent
before reaching the surface. This is the case for commonly used biocompatible pHPMA
reactive polymers [15]. If all reactive groups of a polymer are already hydrolyzed then
the polymer cannot covalently bind to the surface of the virus. Hence, we have to
consider that only a fraction r(t) of the polymers is still reactive at time t. Depending
on the form of r(t), diﬀerent polymer coats may be created. This issue will be discussed
in more detail in Section 4.4.

Polymers are long ﬂexible molecules [4]. The pHPMA polymer molecule has (one
or more) reactive group(s) which can react with the primary amino groups on the viral
surface. As a result, a polymer molecule becomes covalently (irreversibly) attached to
the surface at a point. The rest of the polymer is not attached (unless another covalent
bond is created) and it freely “wiggles” in the space above the viral surface. Having in
mind that the “wiggling tail” does not perfectly shield the underlying surface, we gener-
alize the classical RSA model to allow partial overlap of the adsorbing macromolecules,
i.e. we allow some squeezing of the polymers.

Let N(t) be the number of polymers attached to the surface at time t. Let A(t) be
the total area of the surface covered by adsorbed polymers at time t. Since we cover
the surface by polymers of diﬀerent sizes, there is no obvious relation between A(t) and

3

N(t). However, both variables A(t) and N(t) are of practical interest as discussed below.
We cover the surface of the virus by polymers to protect the surface from unwanted
interactions. Hence, the number A(t) gives us the simple characterization of the area of
the surface which is protected by the polymer coat. The unwanted interactions are not
the only problem which one has to overcome in order to use viruses as a drug delivery
system. Another important task is to retarget the virus to infect the cells of interest
(e.g. cancer cells) via new receptors. Assuming that we put one “targeting” group per
polymer molecule, the number of targeting molecules will be equal to N(t).

If we considered the adsorption of the same-size nonoverlapping objects of the area
a, then we would have A(t) = aN(t). In our case, the adsorbing molecules have diﬀerent
sizes. There is no obvious relation between A(t) and N(t) and both quantities are of
interest. In the following sections, we will present theoretical approaches to compute
the time evolution of A(t) and N(t).

3 A simple generalization of random sequential ad-

sorption

Random sequential adsorption has been extensively studied during the last several
decades [5]. The theoretical work is more mature in one dimension with information in
higher dimensions mostly coming from numerical simulations [10]. If we consider ﬁxed
size objects, then RSA usually starts from an empty surface and continues until the
time when no further object can be placed, the so-called “jamming limit”. If the objects
to be covered have spherical symmetry [13] then the coverage approaches the jamming
limit as t−1/d where t is time and d is the dimension. The asymptotic behaviour can be
more complicated for objects of diﬀerent shape [5].

As argued in Section 2, polydispersity is often present in real systems. If we allow ad-
sorbing particles (in one spatial dimension) of arbitrarily small length, then the coverage
approaches the full coverage as t → ∞. Relatively less is known for polydisperse adsorp-
tion. One-dimensional analytical results can be found in [10], where it is assumed that
the attached polymers prevent binding of other polymer molecules that would overlap
with them. In reality, the polymer molecules are stretching during the adsorption pro-
cess, creating a polymer brush (for semitelechelic polymers) after suﬃciently long time
[11, 3]. Thus each molecule “covers” a smaller surface area at later times. Consequently,
it is possible to adsorb more molecules onto the surface. Here, we take this fact into
account and we modify the random sequential adsorption algorithm accordingly. We
state our generalized random sequential algorithm (gRSA) in one dimension as follows.
gRSA algorithm: We consider adsorption of small intervals of diﬀerent sizes
onto the interval [0, 1], the adsorbing domain. At each time step, the size of a
small interval is chosen randomly according to the probability distribution func-
tion p(z). We select randomly the position of the center w inside the adsorbing

4

domain [0, 1] and we make an attempt to place the small interval of length z
there. If the center w of the segment to be adsorbed lies inside a segment al-
ready placed, the adsorption is rejected. If the position of the center w is chosen
in the gap (x1, x2) between attached polymers, then the new polymer segment
is adsorbed with probability ξ(z, w − x1, x2 − w) where w − x1 and x2 − w are
distances of the center w of the polymer from the endpoints of the gap (x1, x2).

The parameters of gRSA which have to be speciﬁed include the probability distribution
function p(z) and the probability ξ(z, w − x1, x2 − w). In what follows, we assume that
the lengths of polymers are distributed according to the formula

(α + 1)ε−α−1zα
0

for z < ε,
for z ≥ ε,

p(z) =

(cid:26)

for α > −1 and small ε ≪ 1. Let us assume that the position of the center w of the new
polymer is chosen in the gap [x1, x2], i.e. w ∈ [x1, x2]. Then we take the probability
(per unit time) of adsorbing the polymer segment of length z ≤ x = x1 − x2 as

and the probability of adsorbing the polymer segment of length z > x as

the length of the new polymer segment z. Formula (3.3) is shown in Figure 1(b) where
the gap size x = x2 − x1 is less than the length of the new polymer z.

To explain the motivation behind formula (3.2), three possible cases of the relative
position of the new (red) interval of the length z ≤ x and the gap (x1, x2) are shown in
Figure 2. In Figure 2(a), the red interval is rejected because its middle point w lies inside
a polymer segment which is already adsorbed to the surface. Hence, the probability of

allow it to be adsorbed with probability ξ = 1. Cases in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(c) are
treated as in the classical RSA model.

In Figure 2(b), the center of the red polymer is inside the gap but the red polymer
overlaps with neighboring polymers segments. This polymer would be rejected by the
classical RSA model. We believe it is more realistic to consider that such a polymer
will be adsorbed with some nonzero probability which continuously interpolates between
the cases shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(c), i.e. between zero for w − x1 = 0 and 1 for
w − x1 = z. Formula (3.2) takes this fact into account, using simple linear interpolation.
Formula (3.3) naturally extends the formula (3.2) for polymer segment lengths greater
than the gaps (see also Figure 1).

Having explained the new rules for adsorbing the polymer, we must also specify what
part of the surface is actually covered. We will assume that the new polymer covers
only the intersection of the intervals

The number of polymers attached to the surface at time t, N(t), can be also related
to G(x, t), as we will see in Section 4.1. Thus, the starting point of the analysis of the
system is the derivation of the evolution equation for the distribution function of gaps
G(x, t).

A gap of length x can be created from a larger gap (of length y > x) by adsorbing a
suitable interval to the system. Thus the evolution of the concentration of gaps G(x, t)
is given by the equation

overlapping random sequential adsorption [10], namely one can show that the jamming
limit is asymptotically approached as t−1 [13].

Random sequential adsorption with a probability distribution p(z) given by (3.1) and

4.3 Evolution of gRSA

The temporal evolution of the gRSA model is more complex than the cases discussed
in Section 4.2. To see this, we use the moments Mγ(t) deﬁned by (4.14). Multiplying
equation (4.6) by xγ and integrating over x, we can derive the equation for moments

(4.23)

To illustrate the result (4.23), we will execute two stochastic simulations with the gRSA
algorithm. We will use (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3) where α = −0.1 or α = −0.3. We choose
ε = 10−3. The results are given in Figure 4, where the time evolution of the number of
gaps and the number of adsorbed polymers are shown. Note that we use a logarithmic
scale on the time axis because the long-term dynamics are very slow. For α = −0.1,
the stochastic simulation was stopped when 99.9999% of the surface was covered. For
α = −0.3, the stochastic simulation was stopped when 99.9994% of the surface was
covered.

Next, we will study the behaviour of the system for α < α. Here, we will assume

the scaling ansatz (4.13). Diﬀerentiating (4.22) with respect of γ, we obtain

If γ is equal to γ(α), then the moment Mγ is

H(γ, α) = 0

a = b + b γ(α)

between the coeﬃcients of the scaling ansatz (4.13) and the parameter α of the model.
Finally, substituting the scaling ansatz (4.13) into (4.21), one can ﬁnd that b = (α+2)−1.
Hence, the scaling of moments (4.15) can be rewritten in the form

Mβ(t) ∼ tµ

Figure 7: Scaled cumulative distribution function of gaps for gRSA model for α = −0.5
(panel on the left) and α = −2/3 (panel on the right).

Finally, one can easily show that formula (4.27) works also for the case α ≤ α < 0.
To illustrate it, we plot the time evolution of the quantity [1 − A(t)]−1 for α = −0.1
and α = −0.3 in Figure 4 (bottom panel) using the scaling (4.27). On the other hand,
formula (4.28) is no longer correct because integrating of (4.10) implies that N(t) is
approaching a constant value. More precisely, N(t) ∼ C + tσ(α) for σ(α) < 0. If α is
positive than (4.23) is valid, i.e. we have (4.23) for any α > α.

4.4 Time dependent concentration of reactive polymers

As discussed before, the reactive groups on our polymers are capable of reacting with the
solvent before reaching the surface [15]. It may therefore be more realistic to consider
that only a fraction of polymers r(t) is still reactive at time t. Here, r(t) ∈ [0, 1], r(0) = 1
and r(t) is a decreasing function of time.

The random sequential adsorption algorithm has to be modiﬁed as follows: at each
time step, we generate the random number uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1).
If this number is greater than r(t), then the selected polymer has lost its binding site
through reaction with the solvent (it cannot be adsorbed), and we continue with the
next step. Otherwise, we choose randomly a position on the interval and we attempt to
place the polymer there.

Depending on the form of function r(t), diﬀerent dynamics can be observed. First,

let us suppose that

r(t) =

for λ ∈ [0, 1).

(4.30)

In this case, we can ﬁnd a relation between the modiﬁed random sequential algorithm

1
tλ

16

and the previous results. At each time t, we can compute the average waiting time ∆t
before a reactive polymer hits the surface as the solution of the equation

t+∆t

1
τ λ dτ = 1.

t
Z

(t + ∆t)1−λ = t1−λ + 1 − λ.

(4.31)

Solving (4.31), we ﬁnd

Hence,

∆t =

t1−λ + 1 − λ
h

1/(1−λ)

− t ∼ tλ.

i
Consequently, we can make use of the formulas (4.18) and (4.20), or formulas (4.27)
and (4.28), in the case (4.30). For example, using (4.18) and (4.20), we obtain that the
quantities A(t) and N(t) satisfy the following asymptotic behaviour

A(t) ∼ t(1−λ)ω(α)

and

N(t) ∼ t(1−λ)σ(α).

(4.32)

To illustrate the formula (4.32), we stochastically simulate the gRSA model with the
probability distribution p(z) given by (3.1) and the probability ξ(z, w − x1, x2 − w) given
by (4.11), where the fraction of the reactive polymers in the system decreases with time
according to (4.30). We select ε = 10−3 and verify the asymptotic behaviour (4.32) for
α = −0.5 and λ = 0.5. Then (4.32) implies

1 − A(t) ∼ t−0.1014

and

N(t) ∼ t0.2319.

The time evolution of A(t) and N(t) is given in Figure 8 (top panels). We also present
results for α = 0 and λ = 0.33 in Figure 8 (bottom panels). Again, we scale the time
according to (4.32).

The reactive group is lost by chemical reaction with the solvent. It might be more
natural to consider (instead of (4.30)) that the fraction of reactive polymers is exponen-
tially decreasing, i.e.

r(t) = e−λt

for λ > 0.

(4.33)

The formula (4.33) gives rise to qualitatively diﬀerent dynamics for the system, as
opposed to the dynamics associated with (4.30). For simplicity, let us assume that every
polymer with a functional reactive group can be adsorbed (which will give a bound on
N(t) from above). Then the average number of adsorbed polymers N(t) is

1 − e−λt
(cid:16)
which implies that the number of adsorbed polymers does not approach inﬁnity as in
the previous case.

5 Equation-free analysis of gRSA

In the previous theory, we assumed the scaling ansatz (4.13) (see also [10]) for G(x, t)
and we computed the time dependence of the quantities of interest A(t) and N(t). A
related interesting question is whether we can also compute the proﬁle Φ from (4.13).
One possibility is to substitute (4.13) in equation (4.6) and solve it numerically for Φ but
we will not proceed this way. Instead, we demonstrate the computation of self-similar
proﬁle Φ using only short-time appropriately initialized simulations of the stochastic
gRSA model. In this equation-free context [9, 2], it is easier to work with the cumulative
distribution function C(x, t), which can be obtained from G(x, t) through (4.1); C(x, t)
is less noisy than G(x, t) (e.g. [8]). Using (4.1) and (4.13), we obtain

C(x, t) =

To compute the proﬁle C, we can use an equation-free iterative ﬁxed point algorithm
which is shown schematically in Figure 9. Starting with the initial guess C 0, we compute
the sequence of proﬁles CK, K = 1, 2, 3, . . . , where

C K+1 = Ψ(C K),

for K = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . ,

(5.2)

and where the mapping Ψ is obtained as the composition of the following four steps:

(a) Given the cumulative density proﬁle C K, create one or more microscopic real-
izations of gaps in the unit interval such that the initial cumulative density function
is C(·, 0) = C K.
(b) Use the microscopic simulator (i.e. use the gRSA algorithm) for a short time
∆t.
(c) Compute the new cumulative distribution function C(·, ∆t) at time ∆t.
(d) Rescale C(·, ∆t) to compute C K+1.

One possible way to rescale C(·, ∆t) is to compute the average gap size a0 from C(·, 0)
and the average gap size a∆t from C(·, ∆t). Then the C K+1 can be computed by

C K+1(x) = C

We now present illustrative results obtained by this ﬁxed point computation (5.2) using
the gRSA algorithm. We will use (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3) where α = −0.5 or α = −2/3.
We choose ǫ = 10−3. The results of long term simulations for these parameter values

were already shown in Figure 6. Our goal is to use the iterative formula (5.2) to compute
the scaled cumulative distribution function proﬁle which was shown in Figure 7. This
algorithm allows us to ﬁnd the self-similar shape by performing simulations while simu-
lating at a scale (at relatively larger average gap sizes) where the evolution is relatively
fast, compared to the long-term dynamics close to jamming. The initial guess is given
as

C 0(x) =

0
1

(cid:26)

for x ≤ 1.5 × 10−4;
for x > 1.5 × 10−4;

which means that initially all our gaps have the same size 1.5 × 10−4. At each iteration
step (see Figure 9), we place 1000 gaps according to the cumulative distribution function
C K to the interval [0, 1]. We evolve the simulation until 100 new polymers are placed.
We then rescale the new cumulative distribution according to (5.3) and we compute
C K+1. Several ﬁrst iterations are shown in Figure 10 (top panels). We see that after
20 iterations, we have eﬀectively reached the steady state (the stationary shape of the
self-similarly evolving gap distribution). More precisely, the error between iterations is
small and it is not further systematically decreasing. The comparison of the equation-
free 20th iteration with the results obtained by the long-time simulations are also shown
in Figure 10 (bottom panels).

Finally, we note that many other algorithmic possibilities for the computation of the
proﬁle C exist. The equation (5.2) seeks a ﬁxed point of the mapping Ψ. Instead of suc-
cessive substitution, other ﬁxed point algorithms implemented in a matrix-free fashion
through short simulation bursts can be used to ﬁnd stationary solutions - for example,
Newton-GMRES iterations [2]; these would be able to converge on even dynamically
unstable self-similarly evolving distributions.

6 Discussion

In this paper, motivated by a pharmacological example involving polymer coating of a
virus surface, we studied certain aspects of polydisperse adsorption of macromolecules
in one spatial dimension. We presented an extension of the classical random sequential
adsorption algorithm to capture better certain essential properties of the pharmacolog-
ical model system currently used in drug development research. We introduced partial
overlapping of adsorbing macromolecules, i.e. we considered that the polymers are not
rigid objects but they can be deformed while attaching to the surface. We found two
distinct asymptotic regimes. Depending on the parameters of the processes involved,
we can observe that either (a) the number of gaps between polymers asymptotically
approaches zero, or that (b) the number of gaps asymptotes to inﬁnity and the gap
distribution acquires an asymptotically self-similar proﬁle.

We also brieﬂy discussed the impact of a possible reaction of the polymers with

unchanged and the system only evolves on a slower time scale. On the other hand, if
the reactive groups decay exponentially, this decay ultimately wins over the polynomial
time asymptotics of gRSA. From the applications point of view, it therefore becomes
crucial to know the corresponding rate constants in order to reliably predict what type
of behaviour one might expect over the time scales of interest. Typically, the coating
process is performed overnight in the laboratory and diﬀerent reactive groups have
diﬀerent half lives; measuring these rates becomes an important task.

In this paper we worked in one spatial dimension and provided analytical results
about the long time behaviour of gRSA models. The analytical approach was based on
two important facts: we knew what the good macroscopic observables for describing the
system behaviour were and we were able to write down analytically tractable equations
for these observables. The good observable for our system was a distribution of gaps
G(x, t) between adsorbed polymers. If we know the initial distribution of gaps G(0, t)
one could easily predict G(x, t) at future times.

On the other hand, if we know (hope) that the gap distribution G(x, t) is a good
observable for the system of interest but we do not know the evolution equation for
G(x, t), then it is still possible to use the equation-free methods [9]. The main idea
of the equation-free methods is to use the short bursts of appropriately initialized mi-
croscopic/stochastic computations to estimate macroscopic quantities of interest on de-
mand. Hence, if one does not have an explicit coarse-grained evolution equation for the
system statistics, one can in principle avoid long, brute-force simulations. This might be
the case for one-dimensional adsorption problems with more complicated microscopic
evolution rules.

The situation becomes signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult in the higher dimensional case.
Here, the analytical theory is far behind in development, and the literature contains
mostly computational results. The ﬁrst question for higher dimensional adsorption
is the nature of the “good” coarse-grained observables for the system. Good observ-
ables (the variables in terms of which the unavailable eﬀective model would be written)
are necessary for developing a useful analytical theory. Knowing appropriate coarse-
grained observables is also an important feature of equation-free algorithms. Having
one-dimensional analogues in mind, we see that one needs an eﬀective way to describe the
statistics of “gaps” (free space) in higher dimensions. If we cannot estimate (by intuition
or by suitable algorithms for the detection of low-dimensionality in high-dimensional
data) eﬀectively good observables for the system, then the direct, brute-force compu-
tationally intensive simulations might be the only modelling option. In this paper we
showed cases where we could do more than brute-force simulation and provided analyt-
ical results giving insights into the dynamics of gRSA.

The problems studied in this paper were motivated by the pharmacological exam-
ple mentioned above, and realistic predictive modelling of the problem clearly requires
extensive model parameter information that must come from experimental data. As
we showed, we can expect diﬀerent dynamics of the problem depending on the values

22

of the parameters of the polymer and the virus which are used. Obtaining reliably
such parameters and bounds on their uncertainty for our particular model problem is
non-trivial, and we are not yet ready to report about it.

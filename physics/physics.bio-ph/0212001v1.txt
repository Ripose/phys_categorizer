Abstract

A time- and space-discrete model for the growth of a rapidly satu-
rating local biological population N (x, t) is derived from a hierarchical
random deposition process previously studied in statistical physics.
Two biologically relevant parameters, the probabilities of birth, B,
and of death, D, determine the carrying capacity K. Due to the ran-
domness the population depends strongly on position, x, and there is
a distribution of carrying capacities, Π(K). This distribution has self-
similar character owing to the imposed hierarchy. The most probable
carrying capacity and its probability are studied as a function of B
and D. The eﬀective growth rate decreases with time, roughly as in
a Verhulst process. The model is possibly applicable, for example, to
bacteria forming a “towering pillar” bioﬁlm. The bacteria divide on
randomly distributed nutrient-rich regions and are exposed to random
local bactericidal agent (antibiotic spray). A gradual overall temper-
ature change away from optimal growth conditions, for instance, re-
duces bacterial reproduction, while bioﬁlm development degrades an-
timicrobial susceptibility, causing stagnation into a stationary state.

1 Introduction of the model

∈

As a concrete example, consider bacteria on a line with local population
[0, 1]. The population is normalized, so that N is to
N(x, t) deﬁned on x
be interpreted as a density rather than the number of bacteria. Generaliza-
tion to two or three space dimensions is straightforward, as will become clear
from the simple structure of the model. Assume, for simplicity, a homoge-
neous initial condition N0 = N(x, 0) > 0, representing inoculation along the
line of a thin uniform layer. At t > 0 the growth process is characterized by
a probability of birth, B, which is applied to segments or “patches” along
the line. The stochastic character of the growth reﬂects that the surface is
inhomogeneous. Some areas are rich in nutrient (e.g., agar), others not. The
division process is eﬀective only in nutrient-rich patches. These patches are
assumed to be of characteristic size 1/λ, where λ is a scale factor central to
the model. Alternative ways of inducing spatially non-uniform growth or de-
pletion are to apply, for photosynthetic bacteria, favourable or unfavourable
(UV) illumination according to a structured or random spatial pattern [1, 2].
Besides nutrient non-uniformity, the environmental conditions are locally
modiﬁed in a random way, for example by spraying drops of an antibiotic
which subsequently spreads by diﬀusion or transport resulting from bacterial
motility. In places with low chemical concentration the population stagnates,
elsewhere it shrinks. The action of the bactericidal product is expressed
through a probability of death, D. An interesting variant on antibiotics, and
relevant in particular to inhibition of bioﬁlm formation, is a nutrient remover
like, for example, lactoferrin. This protein, which is abundant in human
external secretions, mops up traces of iron and thereby deprives bacteria
of an essential substance. Applied in concentrations below those that kill or
prevent growth, it just slightly increases the division time of the bacteria and
enhances their surface motility, causing them to “twitch” or wander around
seeking food. As a result, microcolonies do not form and matrix-encased
communities specialized for surface persistence (bioﬁlms) do not develop [3].
The model is composed as follows. The characteristic size of the spatial
inhomogeneity of the nutrient is, for simplicity, taken to be the same as that
of the applied antimicrobial perturbation. The (unit) line is thus divided in
λ segments, each of which has the size of, say, an antibiotic drop. The proba-
bility of birth B is applied to each segment, and subsequently the probability
of death, D. Each segment is thus visited twice. We have 0

without loss of generality we take λ = 3 in this paper.

One generation later this process is repeated, but the maximum local in-
crease or decrease of the population is reduced by a factor of λ. This reduction
is repeated in every generation. In this way the growth process eventually
comes to a halt, and the population approaches a carrying capacity, as is
commonly the case in models for a single species [4]. This rescaling of the
growth or the depletion is a crucial ingredient of the model and leads to a
hierarchical build-up of the population. While introduced here heuristically,
various justiﬁcations can be invoked for this feature. It is known that bac-
terial reproductivity and/or susceptibility to antimicrobial agents can “wear
out” in a systematic manner, uniformly in space. For example, the eﬀective
birth rate decreases signiﬁcantly by varying the temperature some 10 degrees
away from optimal growth conditions. Also, once a bioﬁlm starts forming,
it becomes resistant to nutrient removers like lactoferrin, and it notoriously
resists killing by antibiotics.

Further, the rescaling by a factor λ is applied not only to the increase or
decrease of the local population, but also to the typical size of the nutrient-
rich or bactericidal patches. The justiﬁcation for this runs as follows. Since
after one generation (of the order of two hours in real time) the nutrient or
chemical contamination has been redistributed in space, by diﬀusion or by
bacterial motion, regions which were initially rich (or pure) will show poor
(or toxic) spots, while initially barren regions will display small fertile areas.
Therefore, we apply the random birth and death rules on a smaller length
scale, reduced by a factor of λ with respect to the previous generation, and
repeat this reduction generation after generation.

In sum, every new generation the population ﬂuctuations are reduced by
cooling (or heating) and bioﬁlm development, and they occur on a smaller
length scale due to diﬀusive nutrient/antibiotic fragmentation. A single scale
factor controls - in this greatly simpliﬁed model - all these dynamical com-
plications, so that neither external time-dependent ﬁelds nor “interparticle”
interactions occur explicitly in what follows. Repeating this process satura-
tion is reached exponentially rapidly, typically in less than 10 generations, as
the calculations show. The resulting local population density for long times,
N(x,
), is highly inhomogeneous and largely reﬂects the initial random dis-
tribution of the nutrient distribution and the toxic contamination, brought
about by spraying. Considered mathematically, N(x,
) is a fractal curve
with inﬁnite length, but trivial fractal dimension dF = 1. Figure 1 shows

Figure 1: Sample of a local population density after 5 generations of hier-
archical random growth with B = 0.5 and D = 0.2, N(x, 5). The rescaling
factor is λ = 3. The initial population is N(x, 0) = 0.5. The green (red) area
indicates the massive growth (depletion) which occurred in the ﬁrst genera-
tion. As a result, large jumps at x = 1/3 and x = 2/3 persist for all later
times.

Note that the natural death of the organisms is not included explicitly in
the model, for the simple reason that the induced saturation occurs on a time
scale (several hours) signiﬁcantly shorter than the natural lifetime. In other
words, the probability D pertains to death caused by bactericidal products.
In Fig.1 it can be seen that what happens in the ﬁrst generation dominates
the future evolution. For example, the green square represents the massive
growth on a nutrient-rich segment, (2/3, 1), while the red square indicates
the result of the killing of most of the bacteria on a toxic patch, (1/3, 2/3).
In the ﬁrst segment, (0, 1/3), nothing happened in the ﬁrst generation. After
a few generations the population “landscape” consists of towers and deep
crests, which get rougher as time progresses, but which hardly change size
anymore.

second, whereas in the deposition model there is only one visit per segment,
per generation. Therefore, after a complete visit the population is increased

Using the deposition model it is easy to derive analytical results in terms
of the variables P and Q, and also numerical simulation is straightforward. In
generation n the process requires just λn (pseudo-)random numbers. For each
segment of width λ−n along x the population is increased by an amount equal
to the segment size (in dimensionless units) with probability P , or reduced by
(P +
that amount with probability Q, or left unchanged with probability 1
Q). This leads to the characteristic rapidly converging population landscape
formed by squares of decreasing size (Fig.1).

The initial condition is taken to be N0 = 1/(λ

(uniform inoculation). The ﬁrst quantity of interest is the mean carrying
capacity, ¯K, which is the ensemble average of N(x,

dom realizations of the process. Since on average the population grows by

Generalization of the model to higher dimensions (e.g., substrate dimen-
sion 2) is not pursued here, but the results of such extension can easily be

4

anticipated by examining the landscapes shown for the hierarchical depo-
sition model [5, 6] on planar substrates.
In fact, if the bacterial popula-
tion is compact, the value of N(x, t) is simply proportional to the height
of the bioﬁlm above the substrate, and the landscapes can be interpreted
as three-dimensional in real space. This correspondence holds as long as
there are no “overhangs” in the bioﬁlm, and thus works for towering pillar
structures but not for mushroom-shaped ones [3]. The similarity between
the three-dimensional characteristic landscapes generated in this model, and
the structure of its horizontal cross-section[6] (see Fig.6 in that reference),
and images of vertical and horizontal sections of a towering pillar bioﬁlm,
as obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy, is remarkable[7]. This
suggests that a hierarchical model may be a reasonable ﬁrst approximation
for describing bioﬁlm growth.

The connection between the model and the familiar Verhulst process is
elucidated in Section 2. It is made clear that B and D are biologically relevant
parameters determining the carrying capacity K, whereas λ simply sets an
overall time scale factor. The carrying capacity distribution, the key result
of this random growth model, is calculated analytically in Section 3, and
concrete examples are discussed in Section 4, together with a check against
numerical simulation. The self-similar character of this K-distribution is
demonstrated and the eﬀect of B and D on the standard deviation of the
population is examined in representative cases. Section 5 deals with the most
probable carrying capacity and its probability, considered as a function of B
and D.
Insight is gained in the abundance of large deviations away from
the most probable K. The ﬁnal section, 6, presents our conclusions and
addresses a possible experimental test of this model.

2 Connection with a Verhulst process or lo-

gistic growth

In this section we are concerned with the uniform, i.e., spatially averaged,
population. The time evolution of the mean, or “quenched average”, of
N(x, t) is given by the change in the mean value, ¯N(t), from t = n to
t = n + 1,

This analogy allows us to identify and interpret the model parameters
unambiguously. The characteristic time scale of the model is λ/(λ
1), a
trivial constant. Therefore, the length rescaling factor λ in the model has no
particular biological relevance, and can be given an arbitrary integer value
λ > 1. The carrying capacity (diﬀerence) given by ∆ ¯K = (B
1)
is an important property, and we ﬁnd that it is determined simply by the
diﬀerence of the birth and death rates. This link between a phenomenological
parameter of the Verhulst equation, the carrying capacity, and the stochastic
“microscopic” model parameters B and D is a key ingredient of our model.

The precise way (in our case exponential) in which the eﬀective birth rate
vanishes is only one possible way in which this rate in a biological system
can be driven away from its optimal value. We envisage that this drift is
achieved by a temperature variation, upwards or downwards, bringing the
bacterial growth to a halt on a time scale of a small number of generations.
In the introduction we already alluded to the fact that bioﬁlm development
can be a factor leading to resistance to antibiotics, which can lead to a van-
ishing death rate. We simply assume that both eﬀects (temperature change
and bioﬁlm formation) are present uniformly throughout the sample. Our
justiﬁcation for assuming a uniform external perturbation responsible for the
saturation is that in our random model the eﬀective birth rate (II.9) does
not depend on the local (x-dependent) population, but only on time. Alter-
natively, the self-limitation of the population could of course also be due to
local overpopulation, but this model is in its present form too simple to allow
for an internal local feed-back process.

3 The carrying capacity distribution

Even though the average growth of the population is characterized by trivial
exponential saturation, the local population N(x, t) for a particular real-
ization of the quenched randomness typically shows interesting large ﬂuc-
tuations. These deviations, highly nonuniform in space, can possibly be

Our aim in this section is to explore the eﬀect of random nutrient inho-
mogeneity and random antibiotic spray on the carrying capacity K, which
is the asymptotic value for long times of the total population. The simple
stochastic nature of the model allows to obtain the full K-distribution in an-
alytic form in terms of the probability of birth B and that of death D, with
modest mathematical eﬀort. Consider a particular random evolution.

For example, in the deterministic limits B = 1 and D = 0, one always has
km = 0, and for B = 0 and D = 1 one invariably encounters km = 2λm. The
will be referred to as a “growth sequence” of length n. Of
set
course, growth sequences are in general degenerate in the sense that diﬀer-
ent population landscapes can possess the same growth sequence. The total
population after n generations, denoted by

At this point it is useful to note that diﬀerent growth sequences may acciden-
tally result in the same value for the total population. For example, a single
local increase of N in one generation can be deleted by λ2 local decreases
in the next generation. Therefore, an alternative sequence in which nothing
changes in those two generations would lead to the same total population.

In closing this section a few technical remarks are in order. Clearly, in
the special cases P = 0, Q = 0, or P + Q = 1 the trinomial formulae we
have derived, in particular (III.2) and (III.4), cannot be used in the present
form. Instead, simple binomial expressions should be written down in those
B)
cases. Further, in view of the relations P = B(1
one can verify that the “biological” domain in the (P, Q)-plane occupies only
the kite-shaped region below the line √P + √Q = 1. On this line we have
D. We will discuss later that this is a symmetry line in the (B, D)-
B = 1
plane. Therefore, the present biological application uses only a subset of the
parameters of the physical deposition model. This is illustrated in Figure
2. The relevant kite-shaped region is ﬁlled in black. The white area below
P + Q = 1 is not accessible in the population model, but it is available in
the deposition model.

4 Bacterial population distributions versus an-

In order to illustrate the carrying capacity distribution and its properties
we turn to a few concrete examples. Consider a process with B = 0.5,
representing equally probable nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor patches, and
D = 0.5, corresponding to medium antibiotic strength. It follows that P =
0.25 and Q = 0.25. Figure 3a shows the population distribution after one

The probabilities associated with the seven peaks in the ﬁgure thus follow
directly from (III.4). Note that the distribution is symmetric about the initial
population N0 = 0.5, due to the fact that B = D.

In the language of fractal geometry [8] Fig.3a can be called the “genera-
tor” of the distribution. If this generator were now applied on a smaller scale
to split every peak into 7 new peaks, we would obtain a perfect self-similar
object, when iterated ad inﬁnitum. However, in the second generation the
generator is diﬀerent and has 2λ2 + 1 peaks, 19 in our example. Its width
is reduced by a factor of λ, as can be seen from inspection of (III.1). It is
the convolution of the two generators, according to the product expression
(III.6) and the sum (III.7), which gives the population distribution after two
generations. The result is shown in Fig.3b.

In this distribution the 7 probability peaks of the ﬁrst generation are still
clearly visible, but they have been split due to the relatively small popula-
tion shifts obtained in the second generation. The 7 structured peaks thus
have a width and ﬁne structure determined by the generator of the second
generation, and all 7 are similar to each other, diﬀering only in their ampli-
tude which is apparent in Fig.3a. Note that the total number of peaks, 73,
is signiﬁcantly smaller than the product 7
19. This is due to overlap of
peaks, which results, as discussed previously, from diﬀerent growth sequences
leading to the same population.

×

As the generations progress, the individual probability peaks can no
longer be resolved on the normal population scale. This is the case already
after three generations, as Fig.3c shows. There are 703 peaks after three, and
6481 peaks after four generations. The global scaling properties of the distri-
bution can be easily understood if one takes into account that the number of
peaks increases by approximately a factor of 9, since the inter-peak distance,
or minimum population shift, decreases by a factor of λ2 in each generation,
as implied by (III.1). Consequently, in order to preserve the normalization
of the total probability the height of the peaks must decrease roughly by a
factor of 9 also.

After four generations the population distribution looks nearly identical
to that after three generations, provided the height is scaled by roughly a
factor of 9. Therefore, Fig.3c (three generations) already reveals the shape
of the population distribution in the limit of a large number of generations,
i.e., it gives the carrying capacity distribution Π(K) that we are interested
in.

Besides the analytic calculation, we have carried out simulations of these
random processes and obtained population distributions in the form of his-
tograms. Obviously, for a histogram to present accurately a discrete distribu-
tion of peaks, the bin width must be smaller than the inter-peak separation
in population. For example, from these simulations, typically involving 104
processes for given B and D, a histogram with 1000 bins on (0, 1) is obtained
which reproduces the analytic results accurately. In view of the fact that little
or no changes can be perceived in the shape of the (properly scaled) distri-
bution for generation numbers larger than three, it follows that a histogram
with ﬁxed bin size (1000) will converge (without scaling) already after three
or four generations and reveal the carrying capacity distribution. In actual
experiments a bin size is deﬁned by practical resolution limitations on the
counting of bacteria. Therefore, the biologically relevant frame-work is that
which employs a ﬁxed bin size.

The example we have chosen in Figs.3a-c is a typical case in the category
of broad carrying capacity distributions with an average value close to (in
this case at) the initial homogeneous population N0. For medium nutrient
levels and medium antibiotic strength the ﬂuctuations are apparently too
large to gain “control” over the outcome of the experiment. The situation
changes drastically when bacteria in a nutrient-poor environment are exposed
to strong antibiotics. In this case a thorough elimination of bacteria results
almost certainly. This is shown in Fig.4.

For birth and death probabilities B = 0.05 and D = 0.95, Fig.4 gives the
carrying capacity distribution after three generations. This corresponds to
P = 0.0025 and Q = 0.9025. Clearly, the population has been suppressed to
far below its initial value N0 = 0.5, and the probability is concentrated on the
0.06. This result is to be
lowest accessible population values, around
expected, and in line with common experience with the eﬀect of antibiotics
on bacteria in a nutrient-poor medium.

N ≈

Possibly a more surprising result from this model is what happens when
medium nutrient level is combined with strong (or very strong) antibiotics.
If we take B = 0.5 and D = 0.99, leading to P = 0.005 and Q = 0.495,
we obtain the carrying capacity distribution shown in Fig.5. The following
properties are conspicuous: i) the population is entirely shifted to well below
its initial value N0 = 0.5, ii) the distribution is broad; iii) the average popu-
lation is about half the initial population. It appears that the antibiotics has
failed in two respects. The population has not been suppressed completely,

and it is diﬃcult to predict the eventual asymptotic population due to the
large ﬂuctuations. Mathematically, this insuﬃciency can be traced to be
caused, not by the medium abundance of nutrient-rich patches in itself, since
only very little growth is observed (P = 0.005 is very small), but by a sub-
stantial reduction of the antibiotic eﬃciency. This reduction, from D = 0.99
in biological parameter space, to Q = 0.495 in physical parameter space, is
due to the indirect eﬀect of nutrient-rich spots on antibiotic strength through
Q = D(1
B). Indeed, on 50% of the bioﬁlm the antibiotic eﬃciency is spent
on taking out only the newly produced bacteria, since B = 0.5, and only on
the remaining 50% of the area the initially existing population gets (almost)
killed eventually, so that we can understand that ¯N(n)

In spite of the strong antibiotics the nutrient-rich surface

the next section we elaborate on the behaviour of the most probable carrying
capacity and its probability as a function of the birth and death rates, i.e.,
of B and D.

5 Most probable carrying capacity and its

probability

With regard to an actual experiment it is important to predict the most
probable carrying capacity, K ∗, that will be observed, and its probability of
occurrence, Π(K ∗), given the birth and death probabilities B and D.
In
general K ∗ diﬀers from the mean ¯K. We have studied these properties of
the model for rescaling factors λ = 2 and λ = 3. Diﬀerences in rescaling
factor are seen to lead to quantitative diﬀerences only, not essential for our
discussion. Here we report on the results for λ = 3.

Since the population distributions converge rapidly with increasing gener-
ation number, the results for the ﬁrst generation (the “generator”) determine
to a very good approximation the relative importance of the peaks in the ﬁ-
nal distributions, as well as the population values associated with the peaks.
Therefore, we can restrict our attention to the ﬁrst generation when study-
ing the most probable carrying capacity and its probability qualitatively, and

There are two lines of symmetry in the model, which merit separate at-
tention. The line B = D is a symmetry line in the sense that the population
distributions for B > D are the mirror images, reﬂected about N = 0.5,
of the distributions with B and D interchanged. On the line B = D the
average population remains equal to the initial population. There is no net
growth (see Section II). One would therefore suspect that, when the antibiotic
strength precisely compensates the nutrient abundance, the most probable
population after the experiment equals the initial population. This is indeed
the case. However, unless B is suﬃciently close to zero or to 1, the ﬂuctu-
ations are large and the probability Π1(0.5) of observing the most probable
population is less than 50%. This is illustrated in Fig.6 (case B = D).

important to keep in mind that it is already a good approximation to the

a large number of generations. That curve, Π(K ∗) must also displays corner-

6 Conclusions and a possible experimental test

Keeping in mind the possible relevance of this hierarchical model to tower-
ing pillar bioﬁlms, as discussed in the Introduction, we recapitulate here the
main model ingredients. The model contains three parameters, birth proba-
bility B, death probability D and rescaling factor λ. B essentially reﬂects the
fraction (or quality) of nutrient-rich area on the surface, and D the density
(or quality) of bactericidal agents. The rescaling factor λ sets the charac-
teristic time scale (Section II) and controls the fragmentation - in space - of
the nutrient-rich patches and the antimicrobial activity, mimicking diﬀusion
and transport. Further, the same λ is used to control the saturation of the

21

population by decreasing uniformly the amount of oﬀspring in each genera-
tion and simultaneously increasing uniformly antimicrobial resistance. This
mimicks, for example, a gradual temperature drop and bioﬁlm development,
respectively, as discussed in Section I. Through the action of λ the model
becomes hierarchical and this leads to a ﬁnite carrying capacity (“freezing”
or stagnation). Undoubtedly, the use of just one parameter λ for inducing
all these dynamical eﬀects, in the interest of simplicity and transparency of
the model, cannot be more than a ﬁrst crude step towards a more realistic
and reﬁned approach.

The growth of the population thus acquires a hierarchical structure, ap-
parent in the fractal population “landscapes” (Fig.1), and expressed by a
(nearly) self-similar carrying capacity distributions (Figs.3-5), the mathe-
matics of which has been discussed using elementary notions of fractal ge-
ometry. The main conclusion from studying these distributions is that for
generic values of B and D a broad range of carrying capacities can be ob-
served, and the outcome depends largely on the sample used. Ensemble
averaging is necessary for predicting statistically relevant properties of this
type of growth.

The question now arises whether this model is relevant to an experiment
in which bacteria capable of forming a bioﬁlm on an inhomogeneous nutrient
ﬁeld are exposed to antibiotic or protein spray and subsequently put in a re-

taken λ = 3, having in mind that the linear size of a nutrient-rich patch or
an antibiotic drop is roughly one third of the inoculation line. This length
ratio can be determined easily in practice and the rescaling factor can be
adjusted, or, of course, two separate rescaling factors can be introduced if
necessary. The external cooling (or heating) rate, taking the bacteria away
from optimal growth conditions, is assumed to be adjusted so that the pro-
cesses come to a halt in about 4 to 5 generations. The quality of the nutrient
and the strength of the antibiotic, incorporated in B and D, can be tuned
experimentally by dilution, for example.

State-of-the-art experiments allow a simultaneous counting of many sam-
ples (say, 104) on a micro-array in order to obtain carrying capacity distribu-
tions, much like is done in ensemble averaging. In sum, a direct experimental
check of this model is feasible, and would be worthwhile, before introducing

22

theoretical reﬁnements which undoubtedly are necessary to make the model
more realistic, but on the other hand compromise the insight that can be
gained using only very few key parameters.

Abstract

Biological adhesion often involves several pairs of speciﬁc receptor-ligand
molecules. Using rate equations, we study theoretically the rupture of such
multiple parallel bonds under dynamic loading assisted by thermal activation.
For a simple generic type of cooperativity, both the rupture time and force
exhibit several diﬀerent scaling regimes. The dependence of the rupture force
on the number of bonds is predicted to be either linear, like a square root or
logarithmic.

Introduction. Single molecule force spectroscopy has made it possible to measure the
binding strength of a pair of receptor-ligand (“lock-key”) molecules using vesicles [1], the
atomic force apparatus [2–4], or optical tweezers [5] as transducers. Thus, the essential
constituents mediating biological adhesion have become accessible to quantitative physical
experiments [6]. This experimental progress has fostered theoretical studies of the rupture
of such pairs under dynamic loading. Thermal activation being a main contributing factor,
Kramers-like descriptions of the rupture process with time-dependent potentials show that
the rupture strength of such bonds depends on the loading rate [7–9]. Such behavior has
been found experimentally indeed [10,11]. While unspeciﬁc theoretical models of the rupture
process reveal generic features, molecular dynamic studies can address the details of the
dynamics of the rupture of speciﬁc pairs [8,12].

Adhesive contact and the rupture thereof often involves not just one but several molecular
pairs of the same or diﬀerent species [13]. The equilibrium properties of the cooperative
eﬀects of such speciﬁc interactions are well studied both in theory [14–16] and in experiments
[17–19]. Concerning the dynamics of rupture of such a contact under loading, detailed models
for speciﬁc problems such as the peeling of a membrane [20,21] or the rolling of leucocytes
in shear ﬂow [22] have been solved numerically to extract a critical tension or shear rate for
rupture. However, it is inherently diﬃcult to separate generic dynamical properties from
speciﬁc ones using such intricate models. As an example for a generic property consider

1

the following question: How does the time and force necessary to break an adhesive contact
under dynamic loading depend on the number of bonds initially present?

The present study addresses this question within a simple model that extends work on
the dynamic failure of a single bond to that of a whole patch involving several bonds of
the same type. Quite generally, two diﬀerent limiting cases must be distinguished. If the
load is primarily concentrated on one bond at a time with relaxation of the load when the
ﬁrst bonds fails and subsequent loading of the next one, the rupture process basically is a
sequence of similar single molecule events. The N0 bonds initially present then act in series.
The rupture time will be ∼ N0 whereas the force will exhibit a saw tooth-like pattern with
a peak given by the rupture strength of a single bond. Such a behavior has been found and
modeled in the related case of unfolding of proteins with several identical domains like titin
[23]. The main purpose of the present paper is to analyze the other case where the load is
distributed (almost) uniformly among several bonds such that these bonds act in parallel.
As more and more bonds rupture, the force on the remaining ones increases. This simple
type of cooperativity leads to diﬀerent scaling regimes for the rupture time and rupture
force.

FIG.1: Model geometry for the rupture of parallel bonds. Symbols are explained in the

main text.

Model. We model the rupture geometry generically as shown in Fig.1. One partner of
the bond (“receptor”) is conﬁned to a substrate. The other (“ligand”) is connected by a
polymer to a transducer which is connected by an elastic element to a sled being pulled at
velocity v. For simplicity, we model both the elasticity of the transducer and the polymers
as Hookean springs with zero rest length and spring constants Kt and Kp, respectively. As
long as a bond is intact the corresponding polymer is stretched to an extension xp which
we assume to be the same for all intact bonds. The elongation of the transducer from its
resting position is xt. Force balance on the transducer becomes NKpxp = Ktxt where N
is the number of intact bonds. Geometry dictates the time dependence xp(t) + xt(t) = vt.
From these two relations, we ﬁnd the time-dependent force on an intact bond as

Fb(t) = Kpxp(t) =

KpKt

N(t)Kp + Kt

vt.

(1)

Following Bell [13], we assume that the main eﬀect of such a force is to introduce an instan-
taneous, time-dependent dissociation rate k0(t) according to

2

k0(t) = k0 exp[Fb(t)xb/kBT ],

(2)

where k0 is the dissociation rate in the absence of a force. The quantity xb is of the order of
the distance between the minimum of the binding potential and the barrier and kBT is the
product of Boltzmann’s constant and temperature.

We are mainly interested in the case of a soft transducer deﬁned as Kt

∼ Kp. In this
<
case, eq. (1) shows that the force on a bond is inversely proportional to the number of intact
bonds for all N(t). Hence, when a bond ruptures, the force on the remaining ones increases.
We now discuss two diﬀerent cases, irreversible and reversible bonds. In the former case, a
bond, once ruptured, cannot rebind. Reversible bonds have a non-zero rebinding rate.

Irreversible bonds. Initially N(t = 0) ≡ N0 bonds are present. The rate equation for

their time-dependent decrease is

∂tN = −N(t)k0 exp[Fb(t)xb/kBT ].

(3)

We scale time with the dissociation rate in equilibrium k0 according to τ ≡ tk0. The rate
equation in the case of a soft transducer then becomes

with the loading parameter

∂τ N = −N exp[(µτ /N]

µ ≡ Ktxbv/kBT k0.

(4)

(5)

This simple rate equation seems not to have an analytical solution. However, its scaling
behavior can be extracted by the following analysis. With the substitution u(τ ) ≡ τ /N one
obtains

∂τ u = u(1/τ + 1) + u(exp[µu] − 1)

(6)

For small τ , u(τ ) ≈ τ /N0 and the second term in (6) can therefore be neglected. The
solution u1(τ ) of the corresponding equation becomes u1(τ ) = τ eτ /N0 and hence a purely
exponential decay for the number of intact bonds, N(τ ) = N0e−τ . This approximation
breaks down for τ >

∼ τ1 with τ1 implicitly deﬁned by

max(1/τ1, 1) = exp[µu1(τ1)] − 1.

(7)

For τ > τ1, we can then ignore both the ﬁrst term and the “-1” in the second term of (6).
The corresponding equation ∂τ u = u exp[µu] is solved by

E(µu1) − E(µu) = τ − τ1

(8)

x dx′e−x′/x′ is the exponential integral and u1 ≡ u1(τ1) is the cross over
where E(x) ≡ R ∞
value of the ﬁrst solution at the matching point τ1. Hence the time necessary for complete
rupture, τ ∗, can be estimated by setting u(τ ∗) = τ ∗/N = ∞ which leads to

τ ∗ = τ1 + τ2 = τ1 + E(µu1).

(9)

3

Based on this approximative solution of (6), three sub-regimes can be identiﬁed:

(i) µ <

∼ 1: In this case, the exponential decay holds till N(τ ) ≃ 1. Physically, the rupture
is then complete. In this trivial regime, where the loading is too small to aﬀect the rupture
process at all, the time required for rupture is

τ ∗

∼ ln N0.

(10)

Note that the same result could have been obtained by analyzing the mean time required
for the irreversible decay of N0 independent bonds under no force.

∼ µ <

(ii) 1 <

∼ N0: In this regime, the exponential decay persists till τ1 ∼ ln(N0/µ). At this
time the number of bonds has reached N(τ1) ∼ µ. The remaining bonds decay according
to (8) which leads to an additional time τ2 of order 1 which is small compared to τ1. Hence
the whole rupture time in this regime is of order

τ ∗

∼ ln(N0/µ).

(11)

∼ µ.

(iii) N0 <

In this case, the exponential decay applies till τ1 ∼ (N0/µ) ln(µ/N0).
According to (8) the remaining time τ2 ∼ (N0/µ)/ ln(µ/N0) is smaller than τ1. Hence the
total rupture time is

τ ∗

∼ (N0/µ) ln(µ/N0).

(12)

Thus we ﬁnd for small loading rates that the rupture time is logarithmic in the number of
bonds initially present whereas for large loading, this time becomes linear in N0. For ﬁxed N0
and increasing µ, the rupture time ﬁrst is independent of µ. It then decays logarithmically
in µ and ﬁnally becomes inversely proportional to µ.
The force measured by the transducer is given by

Ft ≡ N(t)Kpxp(t) ≈ (kBT /xb)µτ.

(13)

Thus, the total force experienced by the soft transducer is independent of the number of
intact bonds and increases linearly in time. The dimensionless rupture force f ∗ = µτ ∗ is
thus given by

f ∗

∼ µ ln N0
∼ µ ln(N0/µ)
∼ N0 ln(µ/N0) for N0 <

for µ <

∼ 1,

∼ N0,

(14)

in the three regimes, respectively.

Reversible bonds.

So far, we have neglected the possibility that broken bonds can
reform. Hence, rupture from a genuine equilibrium situation where bonds form, break, and
rebind requires a reﬁned description where we add a term for rebinding. We assume that one
species of the receptor/ligand couple is limited to a total number N1 with N(t) molecules
bound and N1 − N(t) unbound whereas the other species is available in excess. The rate
equation becomes

∂tN = −N(t)k0 exp[µτ /N(t)] + kf (N1 − N(t)),

(15)

4

where we assume for simplicity that the rate kf for bond formation is not aﬀected by the
force. Without loading, the equilibrium number of bonds is

Neq = γN1/(1 + γ)

(16)

where γ ≡ kf /k0. As loading starts, the number of bonds decreases from this equilibrium
value. With u(τ ) ≡ τ /N as before, we get

∂τ u = u(1/τ + 1 + γ − γN1u/τ ) + u(exp[µu] − 1)

For µ = 0, this equation is solved by

u0(τ ) ≡ τ /Neq,

(17)

(18)

which corresponds to the stationary equilibrium distribution. The loading term becomes
relevant at a time τ = τ1 for which

(exp[µu0(τ1)/N1] − 1)u0 ∼ ∂τ u0 = 1/Neq.

(19)

Two cases must then be distinguished:

(i) For µ <

∼ Neq, τ1 ∼ (Neq/µ)1/2. Up to this time, the loading has not signiﬁcantly af-
fected the number of bonds. The remaining time till all bonds are ruptured can be estimated
to be of the same order as τ1 using (17). Hence,

τ ∗

∼ (Neq/µ)1/2.

(20)

In this case, the rupture time increases as a square root of the equilibrium bonds present
and decreases as a square root of the loading parameter.

(ii) For Neq

∼ µ, τ1 ∼ (Neq/µ) ln(µ/Neq), with a remaining time of the same order. Hence
<

in this case, we recover the irreversible result (12) with N0 replaced by Neq.

Since in both cases the rupture time τ ∗

∼ τ1, we get easily for the rupture force

f ∗ = µτ ∗

∼ (µNeq)1/2
∼ Neq ln(µ/Neq)

for µ <

∼ Neq,
for Neq

∼ µ.

Stiﬀ transducer. So far, we have considered the case of a soft transducer (Kt

∼ Kp) for
<
which the force on a bond depends on the number of bonds. Another limiting case is a
stiﬀ transducer with Kt
∼ NeqKp for the case of irreversible and reversible

rupture, respectively. According to eq. (1), the force on a bond then is (almost) independent
of the number of bonds. Hence, the rupture time is only weakly dependent on the number
of bonds. An analysis of the corresponding rate equations along similar lines as above shows
for the irreversible case two subregimes with

dominated by the polymeric stiﬀness. For the dimensionless maximal force experienced by
the transducer during the rupture process one ﬁnds

f ∗

Similarly, for a stiﬀ transducer and reversible bonds, one gets

Finally, there is a crossover regime for N0,eqKp

∼ Kp, where the pulling starts as in
>
the soft case. As the number of intact bonds decreases towards the value ˜N ≡ Kt/Kp, the
denominator in (1) becomes dominated by Kt and the rupture process proceeds as for a stiﬀ
transducer. For the reversible case, it turns out that both the rupture time and the rupture
force are dominated by the soft part. Hence the results (20,21) apply for all Kt
∼ NeqKp.
<
For the irreversible case, analysis of the crossover regime is slightly more involved. The
diﬀerent scaling regimes for rupture time and force are shown in Fig. 2 without explicit
derivation.

Concluding perspective. Based on an analysis of rate equations, the comprehensive scaling
analysis presented in this paper has revealed several diﬀerent regimes for the rupture time
and force of parallel molecular bonds under dynamic loading. The most distinctive regime
is presumably the square root dependence of rupture time and force (20,21) on loading rate
and number of bonds derived for reversible bonds under small loading. Such a square root
behavior on the loading rate is diﬀerent from both the irreversible case and the dependence
on loading rate for rupture of a single bond or bonds in series. An experimental result
showing such an exponent could therefore be taken as a signature of breaking multiple
parallel reversible bonds. Of course, it will be important to work with a model system
where the number or density of bonds of at least one partner can be controlled in order to
extract the dependence of rupture time and force on this crucial quantity.

An obvious theoretical reﬁnement of the present model would be to include ﬂuctuations
of the rupture time for individual bonds. Other ramiﬁcations can include allowing lateral
interactions between the bonds, combining the simplistic Hookean transducer with a mem-
brane patch with its own elasticity, or modeling the rupture process more delicately than
done here to name just a few possibilities.
It will be interesting to see how robust the
scaling regimes derived in this paper will be under such modiﬁcations which can eﬀectively
lead to scenarios somewhere between the present “in parallel” case and the “in series” case
described brieﬂy in the introduction. Finally, it should be clear that in spite of – or rather

6

because of – the progress made in understanding the single bond behavior, the cooperative
eﬀects of several bonds under dynamic loading deserve further attention both in theory and
in experiment.

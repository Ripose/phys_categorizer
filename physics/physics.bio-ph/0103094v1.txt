Abstract

Theoretical analysis proves that human survivability is dominated by an

unusual physical, rather than biological, mechanism, which yields an exact

law. The law agrees with all experimental data, but, contrary to existing

theories, it is the same for an entire species, i.e., it is independent of the

population, its phenotypes, environment and history. The law implies that

the survivability changes with environment via phase transitions, which are

simultaneous for all generations. They allow for a rapid (within few percent

of the life span) and signiﬁcant increase in the life expectancy even above its

value at a much earlier age.

Mortality is one of the most universal and important phenomena in biology. Human

mortality is extensively studied over two centuries [1–5] and is arguably the best statistically

quantiﬁed biological phenomenon. There exist several evolutionary theories of aging [6] (the

ﬁrst one [7] is only 50 years old). Yet, C. Franceschi (in ref. [8]) notes: ”Longevity is a trait

with some peculiarities because of the unnecessary nature of aging”. This paper proves that,

in contrast to all existing theories, human mortality is dominated by an unusual physical

(rather than biological) mechanism. Presumably, the same mechanism dominates mortality

of laboratory ﬂy populations.

I study a large and diverse amount of over 150,000 data points from 1528 period life

tables, for 3 races on 4 continents in 16 countries during over a century of their history, 36

cases total (here and on ”a case” denotes the population of a given sex in a given country

at any time in its history; in the USA white, black and total populations are considered

as separate cases). Each period life table presents in any given case the probability lx to

survive to any (yearly) age x in a given calendar year. To escape any arbitrary scaling or

adjustment, I use life table variables only.

The survivability lx depends on age x, calendar year t and a complete set A of all

parameters, comprehensively describing a considered population, i.e.

its phenotypes and

their heterogeneous social, medical, dietary, etc. conditions during the previous x years

(from t - x till t). So,lx = lx(t, A). Mortality rate, and thus its statistics and accuracy, are

low in early age. The number of survivors, and thus accuracy, decrease in old age. So, middle

age survivability, e.g., l40, is determined more accurately. Present lx(t, A) and l40(t, A) from

the same life table as the ordinate and abscissa of a point. According to Fig. 1, for diﬀerent

races, countries, continents, histories lx is dominated by the function lx(l40), which depends

only on l40, i.e. invariant to A and is therefore the same for an entire species. The deviation

of lx from this function depends on A (and thus on population phenotypes, living conditions,

history). It is relatively small. From now on I denote lx(l40) as ”the invariant survivability”

and, unless speciﬁcally stated otherwise, consider this (dominant) fraction of survivability

only.

2

By Fig. 1, at any age and in every case, l40 signiﬁcantly changes with living conditions.

Thus, since living conditions of diﬀerent groups in a given case are diﬀerent, these groups

may have diﬀerent probabilities l′

x to survive to x years (the value of lx in the population

is the average l′

x; 0 ≤ lx, l′

x ≤ 1). Suppose the probability density of a given l′

40 in the

population is c(l40,l′

40), i.e.

1

Z

c(l40, l′

40 = 1,

lx(l40) =

x · c(l40, l′
l′

40)dl′

(1)

Z
0

By Eq. 1, 0 ≤ min(l′

40) ≤ l40 ≤ max l′

40.So, l′

40 = 0 when l40 = 0 and l′

40 = 1 when l40 = 1.

Thus, invariance, which allows one to introduce c and which yields Eq. 1, implies that any

population is homogeneous in l′

the dependence of l′

x on l′

40 at the distribution boundaries.
40 is the same as the dependence lx(l40), i.e., l′

In virtue of invariance,

x = lx(l′

40). This, by

Eq. 1, yields a remarkable symmetry of the invariant survivability to the transformations,

speciﬁed by the function c of two variables:

40 · c(l40, l′

40) · c(l40, l′

40)dl′

40

(2)

Such invariance is suﬃciently restrictive to mathematically accurately determine lx(l40) (as

an invariant of survivability dynamics with respect to any population and environmental

changes). Indeed, in a general case the function lx(l40), which yields Eq. 2, must be linear.
A special case of c(l40, l′
40 − l”)yields c′ + c” = 1 by Eq.1, and
40 − l′) + c” · δ(l′
lx(l40) = lx(c′ · l′ + c” · l”) = c′·lx(l′) + c” · lx(l”) by Eq. 2. The latter equation implies
dlx/dl40 = dlx/dl′

x =const. On the other hand, a linear lx(l40) yields Eq. 2 with any

40) = c′ · δ(l′

arbitrary c in virtue of Eq. 1. Similarly, if an entire population is distributed in a certain

interval of l40, then lx(l40) is linear in this interval, and the population is homogeneous at its

ends (as it was in the previous case). Correspondingly, if any population is homogeneous at

certain l40 points only, then an entire population is distributed within one of the intervals

λs < l40 < λs+1 (s = 0,1 is its ordinal number):

and lx(l40) is linear within these intervals. When l40 = λs+1, an entire population of all

ages moves to the next interval. Clearly, such piecewise lx(l40) satisﬁes Eq.2. When λ0 =

0, λ1 = 1, this case reduces to the previous one.

If an inﬁnite number of edge points in

Eq.3 condenses and forms a continuous interval (where any population is homogeneous),

then the invariant lx(l40) in this interval remains undetermined. Of course, the possibility to

distinguish this case from the case of a large number of short linear segments is limited by

the disregarded non-invariant contributions to survivability, but demographic studies prove

that survivability is heterogeneous and exclude the former case (of a population which is

homogeneous in a ﬁnite interval). Thus, in a general case

lx = R(s)

x l40 + a(s)
x ,

λs ≤ l40 ≤ λs+1.

(4)

So, except for the number of linear segments, the very existence of the invariant surviv-

ability allows one to establish its exact law, without any experiments, approximations, and

assumptions.

Equation (4) is the implication of invariance only. Such invariance was also demonstrated

[9] for medﬂy and fruitﬂy families whose diﬀerent populations were extensively studied in

diﬀerent conditions. Fly statistics is rather low, thus their lx was studied as a function of the

life expectancy at birth (which averages lx over diﬀerent ages and is therefore more smooth).

The study was based on ﬂy populations hatched the same day. However, since in most cases

fruitﬂies were kept in stationary conditions, it suggests that the invariant survivability law

is general for humans and ﬂies.

Piecewise linear law (4) and its age independent invariant intersections are the main

predictions of this paper. They are veriﬁed with all experimental data - see, e.g., l1, l60,l80 vs

l40 in Fig.2. Piecewise linear law agrees with (but has never been suggested in) demographic

approximations [3]. Slope jumps in Eq.(4) and Fig.2 are consistent with ref [5]. However,

in contrast to the qualitative observations in ref. [5], accurate Eq.(4) yield quantitative

predictions. Since all lx belong to the same calendar year, their slope jumps are simultaneous

for all generations. Indeed, although the intersections in Fig.2 are reached at diﬀerent times

4

in diﬀerent countries for diﬀerent sexes, they are simultaneous (to the invariance accuracy)

at diﬀerent ages, and (in l40) for diﬀerent populations. The invariant law allows for the

prediction of intersections. For instance, the extrapolation of l80 beyond λ1 = 0.95 in Fig. 1

yields l40 = 1 (while l80 is ﬁnite), i.e. implies no deceased until 40y. This is hardly possible,

and suggests a crossover, which is indeed seen in Fig.2 at λ2 = 0.97 The extrapolations of

l60 and l80 to l40 < 0.94 yield l60 = 0 and l80 = 0 , i.e., no survivors beyond 60y (when

l40 = 0.27) and 80y (when l40 = 0.42). This is never true, and suggests an intersection at

0.4 < l40 < 0.7.

To elucidate the nature of the invariant law, present Eq. (4) in a diﬀerent form:

lx = cxl(s)

x + (1 − cs)l(s+1)

x

when

x ≤ lx ≤ l(s+1)
l(s)

x

(5)

Here l(s)

40 = λs; l(s)

x = lx(λs) from Eq.(4); cs reduces to l(s)

x and l40 [thus, by Eq. (3), to

c]. Equation (5) accurately separates ”nature” and ”nurture” in survival. ”Nature” reduces

to the ﬁxed set of the intersection survivabilities . The set depends only on age and is

invariant, i.e., independent of phenotypes (and thus of a speciﬁc DNA sequence at least

in an entire species), their living conditions and life history. The dependence of the set

on age is not determined by invariance, but invariance implies that it is the same for at

least an entire species. (Moreover, it scales onto the same functions for species as remote

as humans and ﬂies [9]). Thus, it does not change at least as long as the species does not

evolve into a diﬀerent species (demographic data in Fig.2 verify it for 100-150 years). So,

the set must be inheritable. Such set reminds of the body temperature (which in any living

conditions is the same with few percent accuracy) of an entire class of birds and a subclass

of placental mammals. Presumably, both the set and the body temperature are genetically

determined, and independent of a speciﬁc DNA sequence. But the set, unlike the body

temperature, strongly depends on age. ”Nurture” distributes the survivability lx at a given

age between two adjacent intersection survivabilities. The concentration cs(0 ≤ cs ≤ 1) is

age independent (and may be related to, e.g., l40). Thus, survivability follows environment

(in particular, a new intersection survivability emerges) simultaneously for all generations.

5

Equation (5) relates cs, and thus lx, to l1. Since lx is the survival probability in the

same calendar year as l1, so, by Eq. (5), the survivability accurately and rapidly follows the

change in environment according to the value of l1 (i.e., the infant mortality q0 = 1 − l1),

which is established in less than two years. Indeed, whatever the diﬀerence in environmental

factors is, close values of infant mortality imply very close fractions of deceased at any given

age in 1885 Swedish and 1947 Japanese females, despite of their diﬀerent races, continents,

countries, and 62 year gap in their diﬀerent history. Since l1 depends on the environment

in a given year only, the invariant survivability lx is reversible (an entire survival curve

comes back when q0 changes non-monotonically and returns to its previous value), and

statistically independent of the life history during its x years, despite country speciﬁc, highly

and irregularly changing, non-monotonic and non-stationary living conditions. World wars

and epidemics, e.g., ﬂu in 1918 Europe, signiﬁcantly decrease lx. (For instance, in 1915

the probability for a French male to survive to 80y was 5 times less than in 1913, twice

less than in 1917, and 3.5 times less than for a 1861 Swedish male). Yet, they just slightly

shift the plots (mostly vertically, and relatively little) in Fig.2. In a couple of years (which

estimate the relaxation time at few percents of the life span) all plots restore their invariant

dependence, i.e., the memory of the previous life history is erased. Accurate reversibility

of the invariant survivability does not decrease with aging, even in old age. Unless such

reversibility is related to some perfect biological rehabilitation (which is hardly possible),

it implies an adiabatic change in a certain thermodynamic equilibrium. This is consistent

with its relaxation time (rapid compared to the life span, but enormous on a microscopic

scale). Equation (5) reduces lx to the ﬁxed set of l(s)

x . Since l(s)
x

reversibly change into each

other, they are related to diﬀerent equilibrium thermodynamic states of the same system,

i.e. to diﬀerent phases. Thus, Eq. (5) relates the invariant survivability to a certain phase

equilibrium, and the jumps in Fig.1 slopes to the emergence of a new phase. The phase

concentration cs, which Eq.(5) reduces to, e.g., l1, is independent of age. This suggests that

the age dependence of a l(s)
x

is related to the diﬀerence in survivabilities provided by the

same phase at diﬀerent ages. Quasi-equilibrium phases in a living homeostatic being might

6

be related to a meso- (e.g., a cell) or microscopic (e.g., DNA conﬁguration) scale.

While the existence of survivability phases is accurately proven, their microscopic nature,

as well as that of the parameter which determines their concentrations, remains unknown

(as ”units of heredity” were to Mendel). However, any phase equilibrium may be reversibly

manipulated. This means that human life expectancy may be rapidly (within few years)

reversed to its value at a much earlier age. (Note that in just 8 years from 1947 till 1955 the

life expectancy of Japanese females increased 26% at birth, 15% at 60y, and 20% at 80y).

Presumably, the change in phase concentrations may aﬀect other than survivability char-

acteristics, in particular, aging and disease resistance. Indeed, Eq.(5) is not violated even

in Japan prior to 1949 (see Fig.1) and in Finland from 1890 till 1940 (see Fig.2), although

their mortality has a strongly tubercular age pattern during this period.

The suggested phase equilibrium nature of survivability implies that non-equilibrium (in

particular, suﬃciently non-stationary and heterogeneous conditions which depend on age,

sex, social mobility, immigration and other factors), may lead to more than two adjacent

phases and to hysteresis in the adjustment. The contribution of non-equilibrium phases

is most pronounced in old age, when the diﬀerence in l(s)
x

is signiﬁcantly higher. This

agrees with Fig.2. Hysteresis yields small jumps in lx and shifts of the intersections, which

are indeed present in certain cases. The accuracy of the invariant law estimates maximal

concentrations of ”extra” phases. They are lower for females, presumably suggesting lower

heterogeneity of female populations.

Survivability independence of life history implies no correlation between early and old age

invariant mortalities in a given cohort (born the same year). This disagrees with evolution-

ary theories of aging [6]. Stochastic mutation accumulation [7] theory is inconsistent with

reversibility and rapid accurate survivability change with environment. Optimal allocation

of metabolic resources (pleiotropy and disposable soma theories) implies strong correlation

between survival in young and old age in populations born the same year. This is inconsis-

tent with the survivability independence of life history. Reversibility is also inconsistent with

mortality theories (thelomers, oxygen consumption, free radicals, somatic mutations). Al-

7

though natural mortality in the wild is mostly due to extrinsic hazards, invariant mortality,

which dominates in species as remote as humans and ﬂies (in certain protected environ-

ment), and which rapidly, accurately and simultaneously in all generations changes with

environment, calls for biological, evolutionary and microscopic physical theories.

These conclusions, as well as an unusual mechanism of mortality, are accurate implications

of the exact law, which agrees with all demographic approximations and studies [3,5]. For in-

stance, the infant mortality is widely appreciated by demographers as a sensitive barometer

of environmental conditions. However, demographic approximations are developed primar-

ily as a useful tool of maximally accurate estimation and forecast. They are often country

and time speciﬁc, and approximate speciﬁc demographic data better than Eq. (4), but they

do not consider nor care about the underlying general law and its mechanism. In contrast,

my goal is the exact law, albeit of the invariant mortality only (to discover inertia, one must

disregard friction!) and its mechanism, which yield new biological insights.

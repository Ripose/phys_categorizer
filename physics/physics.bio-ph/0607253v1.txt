We generalize a model of H¨aussler and von der Malsburg which describes the self-organized
generation of retinotopic projections between two one-dimensional discrete cell arrays on the basis
of cooperative and competitive interactions of the individual synaptic contacts. Our generalized
model is independent of the special geometry of the cell arrays and describes the temporal evolution
of the connection weights between cells on diﬀerent manifolds. By linearizing the equations of
evolution around the stationary uniform state we determine the critical global growth rate for
synapses onto the tectum where an instability arises. Within a nonlinear analysis we use then
the methods of synergetics to adiabatically eliminate the stable modes near the instability. The
resulting order parameter equations describe the emergence of retinotopic projections from initially
undiﬀerentiated mappings independent of dimension and geometry. The application of the general
approach in this paper to Euclidean and spherical manifolds will be presented in part 2 and 3 of
this series of papers.

INTRODUCTION

An important part of the visual system of vertebrate animals are the neural connections between the eye and the
brain. At an initial stage of ontogenesis the ganglion cells of the retina have random synaptic contacts with the
tectum, a part of the brain which plays an important role in processing optical information. In the adult animal,
however, neighboring retinal cells project onto neighboring cells of the tectum (see Figure 1). Further examples
of these so-called retinotopic projections are established between the retina and the corpus geniculatum laterale
as well as the visual cortex, respectively [1]. This conservation of neighborhood relations is also realized in many
other neural connections between diﬀerent cell sheets. For instance, the formation of ordered projections between
the mechanical receptors in the skin and the somatosensorial cortex is called somatotopy. An even more abstract
topological projection arises when the spatially resolved detection of similar frequencies in the ear are projected onto
neighboring cells of the auditorial cortex. A further notable neural map in the auditory system was discovered in
the brain of the owl, where neighboring cells of the Nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis dorsalis (MLD) are excited
by neighboring space areas, i.e. every space point is represented by a small zone of the MLD [2]. The variety of
examples suggest that there must be some underlying general mechanism for rearranging the initially disordered
synaptic contacts into topological projections.

In the early 1940s, Sperry performed a series of pioneering experiments in the visual system of frogs and
goldﬁsh [3, 4]. Fish and amphibians can regenerate axonal tracts in their central nervous system, in contrast to
mammals, birds and reptiles. Sperry crushed the optical nerve and found that retinal axons reestablished the
previous retinotopically ordered pattern of connections in the tectum. Then in the early 1960s Sperry presented his
chemoaﬃnity hypothesis which proposed that the retinotectal map is set up on the basis of chemical markers carried
by the cells [5]. However, experiments over several decades have shown that the formation of retinotectal maps
cannot be explained by this gradient matching alone [6].

The group of von der Malsburg suggested that these ontogenetic processes result from self-organization. The basic

notion in their theory is the following: Once a ﬁbre has already grown from the retina to the tectum, the ﬁbre
moves along by strengthening its contacts in some parts of its ramiﬁcation and by weakening them in others. It is
assumed that these modiﬁcations are governed by two contradictory rules [7, 8]: on the one hand, synaptic contacts
on neighboring tectal cells stemming from ﬁbres of the same retinal region support each other to be strengthened.
On the other hand, the contacts starting from one retinal cell or ending at one tectal cell compete with each
other. In the case that retina and tectum are treated as one-dimensional discrete cell arrays, extensive computer
simulations have shown that a system based on these ideas of cooperativity and competition establishes, indeed,
retinotopy as the ﬁnal conﬁguration [8]. This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed by a detailed analytical treatment of H¨aussler
and von der Malsburg [9] where the self-organized formation of the synaptic connections between retina and tectum
is described by an appropriate system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Applying the methods of synergetics [10, 11]
for one-dimensional discrete cell arrays, they succeeded in classifying the possible retinotopic projections and to
discuss the criteria which determine their emergence. The more complicated case of continuously distributed cells on
a spherical shell was partially discussed in Ref. [12].

It is the purpose of this paper to follow the outline of Ref. [13] and generalize the original approach by elaborating
a model for the self-organized formation of retinotopic projections which is independent of the special geometry and
dimension of the cell sheets. There are three essential reasons which motivate this more general approach. First,
neurons usually do not establish 1-dimensional arrays but 2- or 3-dimensional networks. Hence the 1-dimensional
model of H¨aussler and von der Malsburg can only serve as a simplistic approximation of the real situation. Secondly,
we want to include cell sheets of diﬀerent extent, which is a more realistic assumption than neural sheets with
the same number of cells. The third reason is that a general model is able to reveal what is generic, i.e. what is
independent of the special geometry of the problem. Thus, here we generalize the H¨aussler equations to continuous
manifolds of arbitrary geometry. By doing so, we proceed in a phenomenological manner and relegate a microscopic
derivation of the underlying equations to future research.

In Section II we present the general framework of our model and introduce the equations of evolution for the
connection weights between retina and tectum. We then perform, in Section III, a linear stability analysis for
the equations of evolution around the stationary uniform state and discuss under which circumstances an instability
arises. In Section IV we apply the methods of synergetics, and elaborate within a nonlinear analysis that the adiabatic
elimination of the fast evolving degrees of freedom leads to eﬀective equations of evolution for the slow evolving order
parameters. They approximately describe the dynamics near the instability where an increase of the uniform growth
rate of new synapses onto the tectum beyond a critical value converts an initially disordered mapping into a retinotopic
projection. Finally, Section V and VI provide a summary and an outlook.

In this section we summarize the basic assumptions of our general model.

A. Manifolds and Their Properties

We start with representing retina (R) and tectum (T ) by general manifolds

R, respectively. In the
framework of an embedding of these manifolds in an Euclidean space of dimension D, the coordinates xR, xT of the
corresponding cells can be represented by

T and

Furthermore, it is neurophysiologically reasonable to assume that the cooperativity functions cT (t, t′), cR(r, r′) are
larger when the distance between the points t, t′ and r, r′ is smaller. This condition of monotonically decreasing
cooperativity functions can be written as

cT (t, t′) > cT (t, t′′)

B. Equations of Evolution

The neural connections between retina and tectum are described by a connection weight w(t, r) for every ordered
R. In this paper we are interested in the temporal evolution of the connection weight

pair (t, r) with t
w(t, r) which is essentially determined by the given cooperativity functions cT (t, t′), cR(r, r′) of the manifolds

is governed by the following system of ordinary diﬀerential equations:

Here α denotes the uniform growth-rate of new synapses onto the tectum, which will be the control parameter of our
system. These equations of evolution represent a balance between diﬀerent cooperating and competing processes. To
see this, we deﬁne the growth rate between the cells at r and t

The cooperative contribution of the connection between r′ and t′ to the growth rate between r and t is given by the
product w(t, r)cT (t, t′)cR(r, r′)w(t′, r′) as shown in Figure 2a. Therefore, this cooperative contribution is integrated
with respect to r′, t′ and added to the uniform growth rate α to yield the total growth rate (11) between r and t. Apart
from this cooperative term in the equations of evolution (12), the remaining terms describe competitive processes.
The second term accounts for the fact that growth rates between r and t′ compete with the connections between r
and t (see Figure 2b). Correspondingly, the third term describes the competition of the growth rates between r′ and
t with the connections between r and t (see Figure 2c).

C. Lower Limits for the Connection Strength

Now we show that the evolution of the system due to the generalized H¨aussler equations (10) leads to a lower bound

for the connection weight. To this end we assume the inequality

to be fulﬁlled for some initial conﬁguration. Then we conclude that the quantity

is positive as both the cooperativity functions cT (t, t′), cR(r, r′) and the connection weight w(t′, r′) are positive due to
(6) and (13). On the other hand we read oﬀ from the normalization of the cooperativity functions (8) that C(t, r, w)
cannot be larger than W :

With this we can ﬁnd a lower bound for ˙w(t, r) as follows. The growth rate (11) reads together with (14)

It can be chosen minimum by setting C(t, r, w) = 0, i.e.

whereas its maximum value follows from C(t, r, w) = W :

To obtain a lower bound for ˙w(t, r) in the H¨aussler equations (12), we insert the minimum (17) of the growth rate for
the cooperative ﬁrst term and its maximum (18) for the remaining competitive terms:

˙w(t, r)min = α

Hence a small but positive w(t, r) is prevented by a positive rate α from becoming zero. In this way we can conclude
that the connection weight w(t, r) is positive, when the inequality (13) is valid in an initial conﬁguration. All further

investigations will concentrate on solutions of the H¨aussler equations (10) with w(t, r)
the growth rates (11) for such conﬁgurations are positive.

III. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

Now we employ the methods of synergetics [10, 11] and investigate the underlying equations of evolution (10) in
the vicinity of the stationary uniform solution. Inserting the ansatz w(t, r) = w0 into the H¨aussler equations (10), we
take into account (5) as well as the normalization of the cooperativity functions (8). By doing so, we deduce w0 = 1.
Let us introduce the deviation from this stationary uniform solution

By changing the uniform growth rate α in a suitable way, the real parts of some eigenvalues (46) become positive and
the system can be driven to the neighborhood of an instability. Which eigenvalues (46) become unstable in general
depends on the respective values of the given expansion coeﬃcients fλT , fλR. The situation simpliﬁes, however, if we

We return to the nonlinear equations of evolution (35) for the deviation from the stationary uniform solution (32).
As the eigenfunctions ψλT (t), ψλR (r) of the Laplace-Beltrami operators ∆T , ∆R represent a complete orthonormal
system on the manifolds

R, we can expand the deviation from the stationary solution according to

T ,

M

M

v(t, r) = VλT λR ψλT (t)ψλR (r) .

Here we have introduced Einstein’s sum convention, i.e. repeated indices are implicitly summed over. The sum
convention is adopted throughout. Motivated by the linear stability analysis of the preceding section, we decompose
the expansion (52) near the instability which is characterized by (49):

We can expand the unstable modes in the form

v(t, r) = U (t, r) + S(t, r) .

nonlinear equations of evolution (35) decompose into

Note that we used the eigenvalue problem (41) for the linear operator ˆL and its eigenfunctions (42) to derive the ﬁrst
term on the right-hand side in (59) and (60), where Einstein’s sum convention is not applied.

In general, it appears impossible to determine a solution for the coupled amplitude equations (59), (60). Near
the instability which is characterized by (49), however, the methods of synergetics [10, 11] allow elaborating an
approximate solution which is based on the inequality (51). To this end we interpret (51) in terms of a time-scale
hierarchy, i.e. the stable modes evolve on a faster time-scale than the unstable modes:

τu =

1
Λλu
|

T λu
R |

τs =

≫

1
ΛλT λR|
|

.

Due to this time-scale hierarchy the stable modes SλT λR quasi-instantaneously take values which are prescribed by
R . This is the content of the well-known slaving principle of synergetics: the stable modes
the unstable modes Uλu
are enslaved by the unstable modes. In our context it states mathematically that the dynamics of the stable modes
SλT λR is determined by the center manifold H according to

T λu

SλT λR = HλT λR

Uλu

T λu
R

.

Inserting (62) in (60) leads to an implicit equation for the center manifold H which we approximately solve in the
vicinity of the instability below. By doing so, we adiabatically eliminate the stable modes from the relevant dynamics.
Then we use the center manifold H in the equations of evolution (59), i.e. we reduce the original high-dimensional
system to a low-dimensional one for the order parameters Uλu
R. The resulting order parameter equations describe
the dynamics near the instability where an increase of the uniform growth rate α beyond its critical value (49) converts
disordered mappings into retinotopic projections.

The ﬁrst two integrals (64), (65) follow from the orthonormality relations (22) by taking into account (25):

where M in (68) corresponds to MT or MR, respectively. Note that we will later make frequent use of the following
consequence of (64) and (68):

Integrals with products of more than two eigenfunctions cannot be evaluated in general, they have to be determined for
each manifold separately. At present we can only make the following conclusion. Expanding the product ψλ′ (x) ψλ′′ (x)
in terms of the complete orthonormal system

the integral (66) is given by

In a similar way we evaluate the integral (67):

In addition, we will need also integrals of the type

ψλ′ (x) ψλ′′ (x) = Cλ′λ′′λ′′′ ψλ′′′ (x) ,

I λ
λ′λ′′ = Cλ′λ′′λ .

where again M corresponds to MT or MR, respectively.

C. Center Manifold

Now we approximately determine the center manifold (62) in lowest order. To this end we read oﬀ from (37), (38)
and (60) that the nonlinear terms in the equations of evolution for the stable modes SλT λR are of quadratic order in
R. Thus, the stable modes can be approximately determined from
the unstable modes Uλu

Note that Einstein’s sum convention is not to be applied. To solve the approximate equations of evolution for the
stable modes (77) with the quadratic nonlinearity in the order parameters (82), we assume that the center manifold

Here, again, Einstein’s sum convention is not to be applied. Therefore, the Eqs. (83)–(85) deﬁne the lowest order
approximation of the center manifold.

D. Order Parameter Equations

Knowing that the center manifold depends in lowest order quadratically on the unstable modes near the instability,
we can determine the order parameter equations up to the cubic nonlinearity. Because of (37), (38), and (59) they
read

where the nonlinear term decomposes into three contributions:

It remains to evaluate the respective contributions by using the deﬁnitions of the linear operators (33), (34) and the

due to (70), i.e.

As is common in synergetics, the coeﬃcients (102) in general consist of two parts, one stemming from the order
parameters themselves and the other representing the inﬂuence of the center manifold H.

With (100)–(102) we have derived the generic form of the order parameter equations for the connection weights
between two manifolds of diﬀerent geometry and dimension. These equations represent the central new result of our
synergetic analysis. Specifying the geometry means inserting the corresponding eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami
operators (20) into the integrals (63), (74) appearing in (101) and (102). Because the synergetic formalism need not
be applied to every geometry anew, our general procedure means a signiﬁcant facilitation and tremendous progress
as compared to the special approach in Ref. [9].

In this paper we have proposed that the self-organized formation of retinotopic projections between manifolds of
diﬀerent geometries and dimensions is governed by a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations (10) which generalizes
a former ansatz by H¨aussler and von der Malsburg [9]. The linear stability analysis determines the instability where
an increase of the uniform growth rate α beyond the critical value (49) converts an initially discovered mapping
into a retinotopic projection. Furthermore, it gives rise to a decomposition of the deviation from the stationary
uniform solution v(t, r) near the instability in unstable and stable contributions. By inserting this decomposition
in the nonlinear H¨aussler equations (10), we obtain equations for the mode amplitudes of the unstable and stable
modes, respectively. In the vicinity of the instability point the system generates a time-scale hierarchy, i.e. the stable
modes evolve on a faster time-scale than the unstable modes. This leads to the slaving principle of synergetics: the
stable modes are enslaved by the unstable modes. In the literature this enslaving S = h(U ) is usually achieved by

14

invoking an adiabatic elimination of the stable modes, which amounts to solving the equation ˙S = 0. However, the
mathematically correct approach for determining the center manifold h(U ) is to determine it from the corresponding
evolution equations for the stable modes [18]. It can be shown that only for real eigenvalues this approach leads to
the same result obtained by the approximation ˙S = 0. Thus, it is possible to reduce the original high-dimensional
system to a low-dimensional one which only contains the unstable amplitudes. The general form of the resulting order
parameter equations (100) is independent of the geometry of the problem. It contains typically a linear, a quadratic
and a cubic term of the order parameters. As a general feature of synergetics, the coeﬃcients (100), (102) consist of
two parts, one stemming from the order parameters themselves and the other representing the inﬂuence of the center
manifold on the order parameter dynamics.

Our results can be interpreted as an example for the validity of the circular causality chain of synergetics, which
is illustrated in Figure 4. On the one hand, the order parameters, i.e. the few amplitudes Uλu of the slowly evolving
linear unstable modes vλu , enslave the dynamics of the many stable mode amplitudes Sλs of the fast evolving stable
modes vλs through the center manifold. On the other hand, the center manifold of the stable amplitudes acts back
on the order parameter equations.

VI. OUTLOOK

The order parameter equations (100)–(102) represent the central new result of this paper, and in forthcoming
publications they will serve as the starting point to analyze in detail the self-organization in cell arrays of diﬀerent ge-
ometries. To this end we assume that the manifolds are characterized by spatial homogeneity and isotropy, i.e. neither
a point nor a direction is preferred to another, respectively. This additional assumption requires the manifolds to have
a constant curvature and their metric turns out to be the stationary Robertson-Walker metric of general relativity
[14]. We therefore have to discuss the three diﬀerent cases where the curvature of the manifolds is positive, vanishes,
or is negative. This corresponds to modelling retina and tectum by the sphere, the plane, or the pseudosphere.

A further intriguing problem concerns the question under what circumstances non-retinotopic modes become un-
stable and destroy the retinotopic order. One could imagine that some types of pathological development in animals
corresponds to this case.

As already mentioned,

lacking any theory for the cooperativity functions, we have regarded them as time-
independent given properties of the manifolds. They are determined by the lateral connections between the cells
of retina and tectum, respectively [15]. But neither a reason for their time-independence nor a detailed discussion of
their precise mathematical form is available. To ﬁll this gap it will be necessary to elaborate a self-consistent theory
of the cooperativity functions.

Our generalized H¨aussler equations are fully deterministic. In real systems, however, there are always ﬂuctuations.
To take into account such unpredictable small variations a stochastic force has to be added to the deterministic part
of the equation. Such ﬂuctuations are known to play an important role, especially in the vicinity of instability points
[16, 17].

Finally, delayed processes could be included in our considerations. Synergetic concepts have been successfully
applied to time-delayed dynamical systems in Refs. [18, 19]. In neurophysiological systems delays occur due to the
ﬁnite propagation velocity of nerve signals as well as the ﬁnite duration of physiological processes such as the change of
synaptic connection weights. Thus, it would be also worthwhile to expand the investigations to time-delayed H¨aussler
equations.

Abstract

Transport of a Brownian particle moving in a periodic potential is investigated in the presence

of symmetric unbiased external force. The viscous medium is alternately in contact with the two

diﬀerent heat reservoirs. We present the approximatively analytical expression of the net current at

quasi-steady state limit. It is found that the interplay of the symmetric parameter of potential and

the temperature diﬀerence generates a rich variety of cooperation eﬀects such as current reversal.

The mutual interplay between the competitive driving factors is a necessary but not suﬃcient

condition for current reversals.

1. INTRODUCTION

Transport phenomena play a crucial role in many processes from physical, biological to

social systems. There has been an increasing interest in transport properties of nonlinear

systems which can extract usable work from unbiased nonequilibrium ﬂuctuations [1, 2, 3,

4]. This comes from the desire of understanding molecular motors [5], nanoscale friction

[6], surface smoothening [7], coupled Josephson junctions [8], optical ratchets and directed

motion of laser cooled atoms [9], and mass separation and trapping schemes at microscale

[10].

The focus of research has been on the noise-induced unidirectional motion over the last

decade. A ratchet system is generally deﬁned as a system that is able to transport particles

in a periodic structure with nonzero macroscopic velocity in the absence of macroscopic

force on average. In these systems, directed Brownian motion of particles is generated by

nonequilibrium noise in the absence of any net macroscopic forces and potential gradients.

Typical examples are rocking ratchets [4, 11], ﬂashing ratchets [12], diﬀusion ratchets [13],

correlation ratchets [4, 14]. In all these studies, the potential is taken to be asymmetric in

space. It has also been shown that a unidirectional current can also appear for spatially

symmetric potentials if there exits an external random force either asymmetric or spatially-

dependent.

The current reversal is very important in new particle separation devices such as elec-

trophoretic separation of micro-particles [15]. The phenomena of current reversal is of also

interest in biology [32]. When considering the motion of macromolecules where the probable

mechanism of vesicle transport inside eukaryotic cells was found to be the motion of proteins

along a microtubule modelled as a ratchet [29]. Myosin moves along actin ﬁlaments towards

their plus extremity, and kinesins and dyneins move along tubulin ﬁlaments towards their

plus and minus extremities respectively.

It is well known that the current reversal eﬀect

allows one pair of motor proteins to move simultaneously in opposite directions along the

microtubule inside the eukaryotic cells. Several biological molecular motors, for instance

kinesin and non-claret disjunctional, belonging to the same superfamily of motor proteins

move towards opposite ends of the microtubules. The ratchet mechanism was used for ob-

taining eﬃcient separation methods of nanoscale objects, e. g., DNA molecules, proteins,

viruses, cells, etc. To date, the feasibility of particle transport by man-made devices has

2

been experimentally demonstrated for several ratchet types.

The current reversal in ratchet systems can be engendered by varying system parameters

[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. The current can be reversed, for example,

by a noise of Gaussian force with non-white power spectrum in present of stationary periodic

potential [19]. The current reversal can also be obtained in two-state ratchets if the long arm

is kinked [20]. Bier and Astumian [21] have also found the current reversal in a ﬂuctuating

three-state ratchet. In the presence of a kangaroo process as the driving force, the current

reversal can be triggered by varying the noise ﬂatness, the ratio of the fourth moment to the

square of the second moment[22]. The current reversal can be induced by both an additive

Gaussian white and an additive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise in a correlation ratchet [23]. The

current reversal also appear in forced inhomogeneous ratchets [17, 18].

The previous works regarding the current reversal are limited to case of one heat reservoir.

The present study extends the study of current reversal to the case of two heat reservoirs.

When a positive driving factor meets a negative one, the current may reverse its direction.

The mutual interplay between the competitive driving factors is necessary but not suﬃcient

for the current reversal. Our emphasis is on ﬁnding conditions of generating current reversal.

This is achieved by using a quasi-steady state limit to solve the Fokker-Planck equation.

2. NET CURRENT OF THE THERMAL RATCHET

Consider a Brownian particle moving in a sawtooth potential with an unbiased external

force where the medium is alternately in contact with the two heat reservoirs. This model

was ﬁrst proposed to describe molecular motor in biological system [29]. The particle motion

satisﬁes the dimensionless Langevin equation of motion [30]

Figure 2 shows the current J as a function of the asymmetric parameter ∆ of the potential

at δ = 0. The current is negative for ∆ < 0, zero at ∆ = 0 and positive for ∆ > 0. Therefore,

we can have the current reversal by changing the sign of ∆, the asymmetry of the potential.

of the current. When δ = 0 and ∆ = 0, there is no current. For the asymmetric potentials,

varying temperature diﬀerence is another way of inducing a net current.

3.2 Current Reversal

The current J as the function of T is shown in Fig. 4 for diﬀerent combinations of ∆ and

δ. The curve is observed to be bell-shaped, which shows the feature of resonance. When

T → 0, J tends to zero for all values of δ and ∆. Therefore, the particle can not pass the

barrier and there is no currents. When T → ∞ so that the thermal noise is very large,

the ratchet eﬀect disappear and J → 0, also. There is an optimized value of T at which

the current J takes its maximum value. There is no current reversal at δ = 0.1, ∆ = 0.9;

δ = 0.1, ∆ = 0.1; δ = −0.1, ∆ = −0.1; and δ = −0.1, ∆ = −0.9. In fact, we can not have

the current reversal via temperatrue if ∆δ > 0 (Fig. 2-Fig. 4).

In Fig. 5a, we plot the current J as a function of temperature T for diﬀerent combinations

of ∆ and δ. When temperature diﬀerence (δ = 0.1) is positive, the current may reverse its

direction as increasing temperature for negative ∆ (∆ = −0.8).

It is observed that the

current reversal may occur for negative δ and positive ∆ (δ = −0.1, ∆ = 0.8). We can also

exit current reversal for ∆δ < 0. However, ∆δ < 0 is not suﬃcient condition for current

reversal, for example, the current is always positive for δ = 0.1, ∆ = −0.3 and negative for

δ = −0.1, ∆ = 0.2 (see Fig. 5a).

is maximum ∆ for zero current, and ∆b (-0.4913) is asymmetric parameter of potential for zero

current when T → 0, Ta is temperature for zero current when ∆ = −1.0.

In order to present current reversal in detail, the current counter are represented in Fig.

6 and Fig. 7. In Fig. 6, the current values are negative under the current counter curve

valued J = 0 (dash line), while they are positive above it. When T > Ta or ∆ > ∆c, no

current reversal can be obtained (see the case δ = 0.1, ∆ = −0.3 in Fig. 5a). When one

changes T or ∆, current reversal may occur for the case of T < Ta or ∆ < ∆c (see the

case δ = 0.1, ∆ = −0.8 in Fig. 5a). Especially, it is observed that the current reverses its

direction twice for the case of ∆b < ∆ < ∆c (see the case δ = 0.1, ∆ = −0.4 in Fig .5b).

From Fig. 7, we can see that the current is always negative and there is no current

reversal for δ ≤ 0, ∆ = −0.6. When δa < δ < δc, the current may reverse its direction as

increasing temperature. Especially, when δb < δ < δc, the current may changes its direction

twice.

FIG. 7: Current counter δ vs T at U0 = 5, F = 3.0, L = 1.0 and ∆ = −0.6. Here δa = 0, δb (0.138)

is temperature diﬀerence for zero current when T → 0, and δc (0.151) is maximum temperature

diﬀerence for zero current.

Therefore, we can not have the current reversal when δ∆ ≥ 0. When δ∆ < 0, the current

may reverse its direction. It is worth to note that δ∆ < 0 is not, however, the suﬃcient con-

dition for current reversal. In our systems, δ∆ < 0 is necessary but not suﬃcient condition

for current reversal, which shows that the mutual interplay between the competitive driving

factors may induce current reversal.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The transport of a Brownian particle moving in a periodic potential is studied in the

presence of an unbiased ﬂuctuation and two heat reservoirs. In a quasi-steady state limit,

we obtain the current analytically.

It is found that the asymmetric parameter ∆ of the

potential and the temperature diﬀerence δ are the two pivotal factor for obtaining a net

current. When the two positive or the two negative driving factors meet (∆δ > 0), no

current reversal occur. The current reversal can not occur for one driving factor(∆δ = 0).

When a positive driving factor meets a negative driving factor (∆δ < 0), current reversal

may occur. Especially, current reversal may occur twice for some cases. However, the

10

condition ∆δ < 0 is not a suﬃcient but a necessary condition for current reversal.

To summarize, it is remarkable that the interplay of the asymmetric parameter ∆ and

the temperature diﬀerence δ with an unbiased external force generates a rich variety of

cooperation eﬀects such as current reversal with the temperature. We expect that our

analysis should be applicable for particle separation devices, control of molecular motors

and other microscale phenomena.

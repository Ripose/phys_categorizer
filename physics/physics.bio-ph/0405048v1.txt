(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We investigate numerically and analytically the coupled dynamics of transmembrane voltage
and intracellular calcium cycling in paced cardiac cells using a detailed physiological model and
its reduction to a three-dimensional discrete map. The results provide a theoretical framework
to interpret various experimentally observed modes of instability ranging from electromechanically
concordant and discordant alternans to quasiperiodic oscillations of voltage and calcium.

Over the last decade, there has been a growing recog-
nition that dynamic instability of the cardiac action po-
tential can play a crucial role in the initiation of life-
threatening arrhythmias [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Most studies to
date have focused on the dynamics of the transmembrane
voltage governed by the standard equation

˙V =

−

(Iion + Iext)/Cm,

(1)

where Cm is the membrane capacitance, Iion is the total
membrane current, which is the sum of the individual
currents for Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ions depicted schemati-
cally in Fig. 1, and Iext is the external current represent-
ing a sequence of suprathreshold stimuli equally spaced
in time by T , the pacing period. A widely used approach
to model the nonlinear dynamics of voltage is the one-
dimensional discrete map An+1 = f (T
An) which re-
lates the action potential duration (APD) at two sub-
sequent beats via the restitution curve, An+1 = f (Dn),
where Dn is the interval between the end of the previ-
ous action potential and the next [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The
periodic ﬁxed point of this map corresponding to the sta-
ble 1:1 rhythm undergoes a period-doubling instability to
alternans, a sequence LSLS... of long (L) and short (S)
APD, when the slope of the restitution curve is > 1.

−

Even though this map has been successful to model the
unstable dynamics of voltage in some ionic models [3] and
experiments [4], its predictions are inconsistent with a
wide range of observations [5, 6, 7, 8]. For example, Hall
et al. [5] found that alternans can be absent even when
the slope of the restitution curve is signiﬁcantly larger
than one, and conversely alternans are observed under
ischemic conditions in which the restitution curve is ﬂat
[8]. An important limitation of the restitution relation-
ship is highlighted by recent experimental [7, 9, 10] and
theoretical studies [11] which suggest that alternans may
result from an instability of intracellular calcium cycling.
The coupled nonlinear dynamics of voltage and calcium,
however, remains largely unexplored.

In this letter, we investigate this dynamics by a nu-
merical study of a detailed physiological model and an
analysis of the dynamics based on iterated maps. The
model consists of Eq. 1, with membrane currents (Fig.
1) modeled based on modiﬁcations by Fox et al. [12] of
the Luo-Rudy currents [13], coupled to equations from a

Calcium release from the SR is triggered by calcium
entry into the cell via calcium-induced-calcium-release
(CICR) [14]. Release occurs at a very large number of
junctions where several L-type Ca channels (ICa) and
a few release channels (ryanodine receptors; RyRs) face
each other in close proximity. Only one of these junctions
is shown in Fig. 1 for clarity. The total release current for
the whole cell is the sum Irel =
rel, of local cur-
rents I k
rel at each junction where release channels are acti-
vated. Active junctions appear as bright localized spots,
or “sparks”, in confocal microscope imaging of calcium
activity [15]. The number of sparks N (t) varies in time
since sparks are recruited stochastically and extinguish.
The model takes into account this spatially localized na-
ture of release and the dynamical equation for the release
current (Eq. 6) captures phenomenologically three key
experimental observations: (i) sparks are recruited at a
rate proportional to the whole cell ICa, or ˙N
ICa [16],
which insures that calcium release is graded with respect
to calcium entry [15, 17], (ii) the spark life-time τr is
approximately constant, and (iii) the amount of calcium
released increases with SR concentration (SR-load) [18].
Instability mechanisms. Ca2+ alternans, a period-
doubling sequence lsls... of large (l) and small (s) cal-
cium transient (lsls peak ci), can occur independently of
voltage alternans in experiments with a single cell paced
with a periodic voltage waveform [9]. Both theoretical
analyses [11, 19] and recent experiments [10] support that
a steep dependence of release on SR-load is the under-
lying mechanism of these alternans. The sensitivity of
release to SR-load is controlled in the model by the slope
of the function Q(c′

j) at high load

∼

dQ/dc′
j.

u

(7)

For a large enough slope, the model produces Ca2+ alter-
nans when paced with a periodic voltage waveform [11]
as in the experiments of Ref. [9].

Steep APD-restitution in the absence of Ca2+ alter-
nans can also induce APD alternans. This steepness is
especially sensitive to the recovery from inactivation of
the calcium current [12, 13]

ICa = d f fCa iCa,

(8)

where iCa is the single channel current and d (f ) is a fast
(slow) voltage-dependent activation (inactivation) gate.
For the intermediate range of pacing rates studied in the
present work, increasing the time constant τf of the f
gate in the equation ˙f = (f∞(V )
f )/τf steepens APD-
restitution and promotes voltage alternans.
Voltage-calcium coupling. The mutual

inﬂuence of
voltage and calcium during the action potential is con-
trolled by the membrane currents that depend on intra-
cellular calcium concentration. These include ICa and
the sodium-calcium exchanger INaCa. A crucial property
is that a change in the magnitude of the calcium tran-
sient has opposite eﬀects on these currents with respect

FIG. 2: Illustration of the eﬀect of an increase in the magni-
tude of the calcium transient, which can prolong or shorten
the APD for (a) positive and (b) negative coupling, respec-
tively. The sign of the coupling depends on the relative con-
tributions of ICa and INaCa to the APD. The solid or dashed
lines correspond to the same beat.

to prolonging or shortening the APD. A larger calcium
transient following a larger release enhances inactivation
of ICa via the calcium-dependent gate fCa, and hence
shortens the APD, but increases the chemical driving
force for Ca2+ extrusion from the cell via the exchanger.
Since 3 Na+ enter the cell for every Ca2+ extruded, this
increase in driving force increases the inward membrane
current which prolongs the APD. Therefore, depending
on the relative contributions of ICa and INaCa, increasing
the magnitude of the calcium transient can either prolong
(positive coupling) or shorten (negative coupling) the
APD, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The sign of this coupling
can be changed in the model by varying the exponent γ in
the phenomenological expression f ∞
Ca = 1/ [1 + (cs/˜cs)γ]
for the steady-state value of fCa, where the constant ˜cs
sets the concentration range for inactivation. Increasing
γ enhances calcium-dependent inactivation of ICa and
tends to make the coupling negative.

Numerical results. The dynamics of the model was
studied numerically as a function of the two instability
parameters u and τf which promote Ca2+ and voltage
alternans, respectively, and for two values of γ that were
found to yield a positive (γ = 0.7) and a negative (γ =
1.5) coupling between voltage and calcium. All the other
parameters are the same as in Ref. [11, 12] and the pacing
period is ﬁxed to T = 300 ms.

The results plotted in Fig. 3 highlight the crucial role
of the coupling between voltage and calcium in the dy-
namics. For positive coupling, the instability of the 1:1
periodic state always occurs through a period-doubling
bifurcation to electromechanically concordant alternans
with the long (short) APD corresponding to a large
(small) calcium transient, independently of whether volt-
age or calcium is the dominant instability mechanism. In
contrast, for negative coupling, three distinct modes of
instability are found that correspond to (i) concordant
alternans, as for positive coupling, but only when the
instability is dominated by voltage (large τf and small
u), (ii) discordant alternans with the long (short) APD
corresponding to a small (large) calcium transient when

the instability is dominated by calcium (small τf and
large u), and (iii) quasiperiodic oscillations of APD and
calcium transient amplitude with a phase and a Hopf
frequency that vary with τf and u for the in between
case where the instability is driven by both voltage and
calcium. Both electromechanically concordant and dis-
cordant alternans have been widely observed experimen-
tally under various conditions [20]. In addition, there is
experimental evidence for quasiperiodicity in recordings
of voltage [21] and, more recently, calcium [22].

Iterated map of voltage-calcium dynamics. To inter-
pret our results, we extend the two-dimensional iterated
map developed in Ref. [11] for calcium cycling when the
cell is paced with a ﬁxed periodic voltage waveform, to
the present case where the voltage is unclamped. To a
good approximation, cs

stimulus [11], such that we only need to track beat-to-
beat changes of ci and cj. Furthermore, we assume for
simplicity that buﬀering of calcium is instantaneous such
that there exists a unique nonlinear relationship between
the concentration of free calcium ci (cj) and total calcium

ICa + INaCa over the time interval
of Irel, Iup, and
[tn, tn+1], respectively, and are functions of (Dn, xn, yn)
for a ﬁxed pacing period; viRn and viUn are the total
amount of calcium released from and pumped into the
SR over one beat, respectively, and vi∆n is the net total
calcium entry into the cell over one beat which can be
positive (negative) if the exchanger extrudes more (less)
calcium from the cell than ICa brings into the cell.

To study the stability of the ﬁxed point of the map
(A∗, x∗, y∗), we exploit the fact that the total amount of
calcium inside the cell is approximately constant during
steady-state pacing. Hence, we can approximate the 3-

unit circle (r = 1). For the latter case, the beat-to-beat
oscillations of voltage and calcium are modulated with a
period 2π/ω. Examination of the eigenvectors for C < 0
reveals that alternans are discordant when λ− is real and
λc > λv. We plot in Fig. 5 the corresponding stabil-
ity boundaries for positive and negative coupling in the
(λc, λv) plane which are remarkably isomorphic to the
stability boundaries obtained by simulations of the ionic
model in the (u, τf ) plane of Fig. 3. This agreement
shows that this simple map captures the main robust
features of the instability of the voltage-calcium system
observed in the ionic model and experimentally.

The numerical study of both the ionic model and the
map in a nonlinear regime reveals the existence of a rich
dynamical behavior including higher order periodicities
(3:3, 4:4, etc) as well as transitions to chaos mediated by
a period-doubling cascade or intermittency depending on
the parameters. Moreover, this model naturally contains
memory [21, 23] due to the slow change of total calcium
concentration over several beats. Both of these aspects
will be discussed in more details elsewhere.

In conclusion, we have outlined the essential three-
dimensional parameter space that controls dynamic in-
stability of membrane voltage coupled to calcium cycling
and we have presented a theoretical framework in which
to interpret experiments beyond the limitations of the
one-dimensional restitution relationship. The main axes
of this parameter space are the degree of instability of the
voltage and calcium systems, and the sign of the coupling
between the two systems, which is an important new pa-
rameter to emerge from this work. These results oﬀer
new concepts to help identify the mechanisms which un-
derly various heart rhythm disorders. This research is

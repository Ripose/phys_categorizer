Abstract

We report methods for correcting the photoluminescence emission and excitation
spectra of highly absorbing samples for re-absorption and inner ﬁlter eﬀects. We
derive the general form of the correction, and investigate various methods for deter-
mining the parameters. Additionally, the correction methods are tested with highly
absorbing ﬂuorescein and melanin (broadband absorption) solutions; the expected
linear relationships between absorption and emission are recovered upon applica-
tion of the correction, indicating that the methods are valid. These procedures allow
accurate quantitative analysis of the emission of low quantum yield samples (such
as melanin) at concentrations where absorption is signiﬁcant.

1 Introduction

Melanins are an important class of dark biological pigment known to be re-
sponsible for photoprotection of the skin, hair and eyes of many diﬀerent
species [1,2,3]. Of the two types found in humans (eumelanin: black, and
pheomelanin: red-brown) eumelanin is the most common [4]. Paradoxically,
it is also believed that melanins are directly involved in the UVA-induced

photochemical processes that lead to DNA damage in skin cells [5,6,7]. The
biological structure-property-function relationships of melanins and their con-
nections to melanoma formation have become the foci of intense scientiﬁc
interest and extensive study. Despite this activity, there remain many unan-
swered questions regarding its structure and properties [8,9,10]. This fact is
in part due to melanin’s strong, broadband and highly non-linear absorbance
(Figure 4), very low quantum yield [11] and insolubility [1,12] which make
spectroscopic analysis challenging. Emission levels are so low that they must
be measured at concentrations where re-absorption and inner ﬁlter eﬀects (at-
tenuation of the probe beam) strongly distort the resulting spectra (Figures
3 and 5). It is clear that a procedure to accurately and easily correct for
these eﬀects is required. This would allow future spectroscopic measurements
of eumelanin (and other strongly absorbing species) to be analysed accurately
and quantitatively. Re-absorption correction methods have been previously
applied to melanin [13]; the work reported here is a far more detailed analysis
of the assumptions implicit in these methods, and of the eﬀectiveness of the
procedures.

2 Calculations

2.1 General Form of the Correction

The following derivation is for a collimated excitation beam incident upon a
square cross-section cuvette (containing the solution of interest), with collec-
tion at 90◦ with respect to excitation (and in the same horizontal plane), as
shown in Figure 1. This is the most common geometry used, although this
correction method could easily be applied to other geometries. We assume a
small excitation volume in the cuvette (deﬁned by the emission and excitation
slit widths) so that we can apply the Beer Lambert Law [14] directly. From
Figure 1, for the incoming and outgoing light, we have:

I2 = I1e−α1d1
I4 = I3e−α2d2

(1)
(2)

where I1 to I4 are the intensity of the beam at the locations indicated in Figure
1, d1 and d2 are the path lengths into and out of the cuvette, and α1 ≡ α(λ1)
and α2 ≡ α(λ2) are the absorption coeﬃcients along those paths (dependant
upon the excitation and detection wavelengths, λ1 and λ2 respectively).

Let the subscript m denote intensities aﬀected by re-absorption and inner ﬁlter
eﬀects (‘measured’ intensities), and the subscript c denote intensities corrected

2

for these eﬀects. We can then split the intensities I3 and I4 into components
as follows:

I3 = Fc (I2, λ1, λ2) + Bc (I2, λ1, λ2) + Rc (I2, λ1, λ2)
I4 = Fm (I1, λ1, λ2) + Bm (I1, λ1, λ2) + Rm (I1, λ1, λ2)

where F is the component due to ﬂuorescence of the sample (which we seek to
recover), B is the background ﬂuorescence (measured from the solvent alone)
and R is the component due to Raman scattering from the solvent [15]. λ1
and λ2 are the excitation and emission wavelengths respectively. In normal
situations the ﬂuorescence, Raman scattering and background components
are all linearly dependant upon the illuminating intensity [14,15], so we can
assume:

where b is an arbitrary constant. Combining equations 1 to 7 we ﬁnd:

Fc(I1) = eα1d1+α2d2 [Fm(I1) + Bm(I1) + Rm(I1)] − [Bc(I1) + Rc(I1)]

(8)

Fc(bI) = bFc(I)
Bc(bI) = bBc(I)
Rc(bI) = bRc(I)

In a more convenient form:

Fcorrected = kFmeasured − Fbackground

where

k = k (λ1, λ2) = eα1d1+α2d2

(3)
(4)

(5)
(6)
(7)

(9)

(10)

and Fmeasured (the emission we would actually measure) and Fbackground (the
background emission we would measure from the solvent alone) are given by
the bracketed expressions in equation 8. Fcorrected is the quantity we seek -
the emission due to the ﬂuorophore alone, corrected for inner ﬁlter and re-
absorption eﬀects. Using standard propogation of random, independant errors
[16], the uncertainty in the corrected photoluminescence will then be given by:

∆Fcorrected = kFmeasured

α2

1∆d2

1 + α2

2∆d2
2

(11)

where we have assumed that the uncertainty in d1 and d2 dominates (this was
found to be the case for our system).

α1 and α2 can be determined from a previously measured absorption spec-
trum. For a photoluminescence (PL) measurement α1 will be a constant (the
absorption coeﬃcient at the excitation wavelength), whereas α2 will be wave-
length dependant. For a photoluminescence (PLE) measurement, α2 will be
constant (the absorption coeﬃcient at the detection wavelength) and α1 will
be wavelength dependant. The only remaining parameters, d1 and d2, can be
determined in a variety of ways, as follows.

2.2 Method 1: Direct Measurement

By assuming that the small excitation volume is in the centre of the cuvette,
d1 and d2 can simply be calculated from the known dimensions of the system
(as shown in Figure 1). For a convential spectroscopic system this assumption
will be valid, and the geometry well known.

2.3 Method 2: Raman Peak Attenuation

If direct measurement of the system is not possible (in thin ﬁlms for exam-
ple, or another unique geometry) then we seek another measure of the re-
absorption. The attenuation of the signal associated with Raman scattering
of the probe by the solvent molecules [15] (the ‘Raman scattering peak’) pro-
vides an alternative method of determining the necessary correction factor.
From equation 8 we see that

k(λ1, λ2)Rm(I1, λ1, λ2) = Rc(I1, λ1, λ2)

since only Rm can respond to a change in Rc, and Rc = 0 must imply Rm = 0.
Combining with equation 10 for k we ﬁnd:

(cid:18)

ln

Rc
Rm (cid:19)

(cid:18)

If excitation at wavelength λ1R gives a Raman scattering peak at wavelength
λ2R we have:

1
α(λ2R) !

 

ln

Rc(λ2R)
Rm(λ2R) !

 

=

α(λ1R)
α(λ2R) !

 

d1 + d2

By exciting the solution at a variety of wavelengths we can plot the above
function such that d1 and d2 are the gradient and y-intercept respectively. Rc
and Rm can be determined by ﬁtting the PL spectra to multiple Gaussians,

(12)

(13)

(14)

as shown in Figure 2. Rc and Rm are the amplitudes of the Gaussian Raman
scattering peak in the background and ﬂuorophore spectra respectively. The
uncertainty in d1 and d2 can be determined from the linear regression, and
used in equation 11.

This method theoretically allows correction of the emission spectra even if the
sample geometry is unknown (such as in thin ﬁlms), as long as the Raman
peak is clearly visible. Even in the well deﬁned square cuvette geometry, this
method potentially allows for the fact that the illumination volume may not
be directly in the centre of the cuvette.

2.4 Method 3: Raman Peak Attenuation Approximation

If it were not possible to apply Method 2 (as shall be discussed in the results
section), then the following approximations may allow correction of unique
system geometries. If re-absorption dominates over inner-ﬁlter eﬀects (α2d2 ≫
α1d1) we can make the approximation:

k = eα2def f

where def f is an eﬀective path length. This may be the case either because
of the geometry of the system, or because of the absorbance proﬁle of the
sample. Following the same procedure as for Method 2 (solving for def f at the
excitation wavelength λ1R that gives a Raman scattering peak at wavelength
λ2R) we ﬁnd

(15)

(16)

def f =

1
α(λ2R) !

 

ln

Rc(λ2R)
Rm(λ2R) !

 

Hence the full correction is:

Fcorrected(λ2) = exp

α(λ2)
α(λ2R)

 

ln

Rc(λ2R)
Rm(λ2R) !!

 

Fmeasured(λ2) − Fbackground(λ2)(17)

with uncertainty:

∆Fc(λ2) =

α(λ2)k(λ2)Fm(λ2)
α(λ2R)

2

∆Rc(λ2R)
Rc(λ2R) !

+

∆Rm(λ2R)
Rm(λ2R) !

(18)

assuming random, independant errors, dominated by the uncertainty in Rc
and Rm [16]. Rc and Rm can be determined as for Method 2.

Note that although equation 15 no longer explicitly includes the excitation
wavelength (as the correction factor did in Method 1), def f will be dependant
upon λ1 due to the non-linearity of the absorption proﬁle. Hence def f must
be recalculated for PL spectra measured at diﬀerent excitation wavelengths
unless the absorption coeﬃcients at these excitation wavelengths (α1) are very
similar, or α2d2 is so much larger than α1d1 that the diﬀerence is negligible.

This also means that each point in a PLE spectrum will have a diﬀerent def f .
Since this is impractical to calculate (unless the absorption proﬁle is constant
at all excitation wavelengths), we can instead manipulate the geometry of the
system so that inner ﬁlter eﬀects are more signiﬁcant than re-absorption. This
can be achieved with a rectangular cuvette, orientated so that the excitation
path length (d1) is signiﬁcantly longer than the emission path length (d2). We
can then make the alternate approximation:

k = eα1def f

giving:

def f =

1
α(λ1R) !

 

ln

Rc(λ2R)
Rm(λ2R) !

 

Hence the full correction for PLE spectra is:

(19)

(20)

Fcorrected(λ1) = exp

α(λ1)
α(λ1R)

 

ln

Rc(λ2R)
Rm(λ2R) !!

 

Fmeasured(λ1) − Fbackground(λ1)(21)

with uncertainty:

∆Fc(λ1) =

α(λ1)k(λ1)Fm(λ1)
α(λ1R)

∆Rc(λ2R)
Rc(λ2R) !

+

∆Rm(λ2R)
Rm(λ2R) !

(22)

once again assuming random, independant errors, dominated by the uncer-
tainty in Rc and Rm [16].

Note that since the Raman scattering peak is not clearly visible in PLE spec-
tra, the eﬀective path length (def f ) must be calculated from the appropriate
PL spectrum (with the cuvette orientated so that inner ﬁlter eﬀects domi-
nate). Any excitation wavelength is suﬃcient to determine def f , as long as the
Raman peak is clearly visible.

3 Experimental

3.1 Sample Preparation

Synthetic eumelanin (dopamelanin) derived from the non-enzymatic oxida-
tion of tyrosine was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and used without further
puriﬁcation. Eumelanin solutions were prepared at a range of concentrations
(0.001% to 0.005%) by weight macromolecule in high purity 18.2MΩ MilliQ
de-ionised water. To aid solubility, the pH of the solutions was adjusted us-
ing 0.01 M NaOH to ∼ 11.5, and the solutions gently heated with stirring.
Under such conditions, pale brown, apparently continuous eumelanin disper-
sions were produced. Fluorescein was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used
without further puriﬁcation to prepare standard solutions at ten diﬀerent con-
centrations varying from 1.2 × 10−4% to 5 × 10−6% by weight in 0.1M NaOH
solution (18.2MΩ MilliQ de-ionised water). Fluorescein and eumelanin con-
centrations were chosen so as to maintain absorbance levels within the range
of the spectrometer.

3.2 Absorption Spectrometry

Absorption spectra between 200nm and 800nm were recorded for the syn-
thetic eumelanin and ﬂuorescein solutions using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 40
spectrophotometer. An integration of 2nm, scan speed of 240nm/min and slit
width of 3nm bandpass were used. Spectra were collected using a quartz 1cm
square cuvette. Solvent scans (obtained under identical conditions) were used
for background correction.

3.3 Photoluminescence Emission Spectrometry

Photoluminescence emission spectra for the eumelanin and ﬂuorescein solu-
tions were recorded for all concentrations using a Jobin Yvon FluoroMax 3
Fluorimeter. Emission scans were performed between 400nm and 700nm using
an excitation wavelength of 380nm for the eumelanin samples, and 490nm for
the ﬂuorescein samples. A band pass of 3nm and an integration of 0.3s were
used. Background scans were performed under identical instrumental condi-
tions using the relevant solvents. Spectra were collected using a quartz 1cm
square cuvette. Spectra were automatically corrected to account for diﬀerences
in pump beam power at diﬀerent excitation wavelengths using a reference
beam.

3.4 Photoluminescence Excitation Spectrometry

Photoluminescence excitation spectra for the eumelanin solutions were recorded
using a Jobin Yvon FluoroMax 3 Fluorimeter. Excitation scans were per-
formed between 300nm and 465nm using a detection wavelength of 485nm. A
band pass of 3nm and an integration of 0.3s were used. Background scans were
performed under identical instrumental conditions using the relevant solvents.
A rectangular cuvette orientated such that d1 = 0.5cm, d2 = 0.2cm was used
to reduce re-absorption eﬀects in comparison to inner ﬁlter eﬀects. Spectra
were automatically corrected to account for diﬀerences in pump beam power
at diﬀerent excitation wavelengths using a reference beam.

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Method 1: Direct Measurement

The uncorrected PL spectrum of eumelanin for three diﬀerent concentrations
is shown in Figure 3. Inner ﬁlter and re-absorption eﬀects are clearly evident;
the intensity does not increase linearly with concentration, the peak shifts
to lower energies at higher concentrations, and the Raman scattering peak
(at approximately 436nm) is increasingly attenuated as the concentration in-
creases (such that subtraction of the background leaves ‘holes’ in the spectra).
The shift in peak position is due to the nonlinearity of eumelanin absorbance
(Figure 4).

Figure 5 shows the same PL spectra corrected using Method 1 as outlined
above, with measured path lengths d1 = d2 = 0.50cm. The peaks now align
very closely (to within 2nm), the Raman peak is completely removed by sub-
traction of the background, and the peak intensity is now linear with concen-
tration, as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 7 shows the integrated PL against the absorbance at the excitation
wavelength for various concentrations of eumelanin. Open circles indicate
the uncorrected data, and closed squares show the data after the correction
(Method 1) has been applied. The eumelanin PL is heavily attenuated at
all but the lowest concentration, but the expected linear relationship is fully
recovered upon application of the correction.

As a standard ﬂuorophore, ﬂuorescein was used as a further test of the correc-
tion method (refer to Figure 8). Due to the very narrow absorbance range of
ﬂuorescein, unlike eumelanin, inner ﬁlter eﬀects are far more signiﬁcant than

8

re-absorption. Also unlike eumelanin, the very high quantum yield of ﬂuo-
rescein means that very low concentrations give measureable emission. Five
concentrations were used in the low concentration limit [17,18], and ﬁve at
higher concentrations as a test of the method. The emission was attenuated
as expected at these higher concentrations, but the expected linear relation-
ship was fully recovered upon application of the correction (refer to Figure
8). Note that since ﬂuorescein has a very sharp absorption peak (Figure 9),
exciting at this peak (as we did here) will make inner ﬁlter eﬀects far more
signiﬁcant than re-absorption (α1d1 ≫ α2d2).

These measurements indicate that this correction method is valid, both for
correction of re-absorption, and inner ﬁlter eﬀects (or any combination of the
two).

4.2 Method 2: Raman Peak Attenuation

Figure 10 shows the plot to determine d1 (as the gradient) and d2 (as the
intercept) according to equation 14. The three diﬀerent solutions (of diﬀerent
concentrations) were measured in the same system, and so should all give
identical values for d1 and d2 (and hence fall on the same line). Figure 10
shows that this is clearly not the case; although each data set appears to form
a straight line, they are all signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, and none of the data sets
gives close to the predicted values for d1 and d2 (as indicated by the dotted
line). Two of the data sets actually have negative gradients, and hence give
negative values for d1.

The uncertainty in each data point in Figure 10 is very large, indicating that
the linear trend in each data set is due to a systematic error in the ﬁtting
routine. Hence we conclude that although this method of correction is theo-
retically correct, in practice there is too much freedom in the ﬁtting process to
determine Rc and Rm (and hence d1 and d2) accurately. These parameters may
be better determined by direct measurement (Method 1). It is possible that
this method may be viable for a sample with a larger Stokes shift; the Raman
peak would then be separated further from the sample photoluminescence,
making the ﬁtting process more accurate.

4.3 Method 3: Raman Peak Attenuation Approximation

Figure 11 shows the PL of the 0.0025% eumelanin solution (excited at 380nm)
corrected for re-absorption and inner ﬁlter eﬀects with Methods 1 and 3, as
well as the uncorrected data (with background subtracted). Note that since the
Raman scattering peak has been attenuated, subtraction of the background

9

without prior correction leaves the artifact observed at 436nm. The two meth-
ods agree well close to the Raman peak, but further away the approximation
used in Method 3 is less accurate (as would be expected).

In Figure 12 we see the integrated PL against concentration for the two cor-
rection methods. Both recover the expected linear relationship, and they agree
at lower concentrations. At high concentrations they deviate more signiﬁ-
cantly, indicating that if Method 3 must be used, extremely high concen-
trations should be avoided. Method 3 still oﬀers a vast improvement over the
uncorrected data, however, as evidenced by Figure 11.

The eﬀectiveness of Method 3 could not be investigated with the ﬂuorescein
solutions since the Raman scattering peak was of much lower intensity than
the dye photoluminescence and hence not visible. Note that this method could
be applied to any emission or scattering feature that is detectable in both the
background and sample spectra (not only the Raman peak).

4.4 Correction of Photoluminescence Excitation Data

These correction methods can be equally applied to photoluminescence excita-
tion (PLE) data. For many materials, including melanins, accurate PLE data
is critical for clear understanding of the emission behaviour. Figure 13 shows
photoluminescence excitation data for a eumelanin solution. The uncorrected
data (with background subtracted) shows signiﬁcant change when correction
Method 1 is applied. Method 3 does not agree closely, but still provides a sig-
niﬁcant improvement over the uncorrected data. This is the ﬁrst publication
of PLE data for melanin, and will be expanded upon in future publications.

5 Conclusion

Two viable methods to correct for re-absorption and inner ﬁlter eﬀects in
emission and excitation spectra have been proposed and validated:

(1) Direct Measurement (Method 1): This method is the most accurate and
easy to apply of those proposed. Upon application of this correction all
of the expected behaviours are recovered. The geometry of the system
must be well deﬁned.

(2) Raman Peak Attenuation Approximation (Method 3): This method can
be used even if the sample geometry is completely unknown (such as
in thin ﬁlms) as long as the Raman scattering peak is visible. It is not
as accurate as the ﬁrst method, but gives a reasonable approximation,

10

especially close to the Raman peak.

Method 2 (exact correction via the Raman peak attenuation) failed in this case
for technical reasons, but may be possible for situations where the Raman peak
and ﬂuorophore emission are better separated.

With these methods it is possible to recover the emission and excitation spec-
tra of highly absorbing samples (such as melanin), which can be strongly
distorted by re-absorption and inner ﬁlter eﬀects. These methods also make it
possible to obtain far more accurate estimates of quantities such as the quan-
tum yield in samples where high absorbance is unavoidable. These methods
have made it possible to obtain quantitative photoluminescence and photo-
luminescence excitation data for melanin, and most signiﬁcantly the ﬁrst ac-
curate measurement of the quantum yield of melanin [11]. This is a critical
step towards understanding the energy dissipation pathways of this extremely
important biological molecule.

Method 1 (closed squares), Method 3 (open triangles) and uncorrected with back-
ground subtracted (open circles). Linear regressions for each data set (shown) were
constrained to pass through the origin. Although at high concentrations Method 3
does not agree with Method 1 to within the uncertainty, it still provides a signif-
icant improvement over the uncorrected data. Errors were calculated according to
equations 11 and 18.

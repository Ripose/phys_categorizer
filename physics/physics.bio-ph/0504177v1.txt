Complex networks have attracted increasing interests in almost all disciplines of natural and
social sciences. However, few eﬀorts have been aﬀorded in the ﬁeld of chemical engineering. We
present in this work an example of complex technological network, investigating the process ﬂow of
an ammonia plant. We show that the ammonia plant (AP) network is a small-world network with
scale-free distribution of degrees. We adopt the box-counting method by tiling the network with
boxes of diﬀerent sizes to show that the AP network possesses weak self-similarity in the sense that
the number of boxes scales as a modiﬁed power law with respect to the box size, which is enhanced
by the power-law dependence of the averaged number of vertices as a function of the distance to an
ego vertex. Adopting Newman’s maximum modularity algorithm for the detection of communities
in complex networks, evident modular structures are identiﬁed in the AP network, which stem from
the modular sections in chemical plants. In addition, we ﬁnd that the resultant AP tree exhibits
excellent allometric scaling.

INTRODUCTION

Complex systems are ubiquitous in natural and so-
cial sciences. Complex systems operate at the “edge of
chaos”, whose behavior as a whole is usually larger than
the sum of its parts. Complex systems evolve in a self-
adaptive manner and self-organize to form emergent be-
haviors due to the interactions among the constituents of
a complex system at the microscopic level. The study of
complexity has been witnessed in almost all disciplines of
social and natural sciences (see, for instance, the special
issue of Nature on this topic in 2001 [1]). However, en-
gineers seem a little bit indiﬀerent as if engineering is at
the edge of the science of complexity. Ottino argues that
“engineering should be at the centre of these develop-
ments, and contribute to the development of new theory
and tools” [2].

The topological aspects of complex systems can be
modelled by complex networks, where the constituents
are viewed as vertices or nodes and an edge is drawn
between two vertices if their associated constituents in-
teract in certain manners. In the recent years, complex
networks have attracted extensive interests, covering bio-
logical systems, social systems, information systems, and
technological systems [3, 4, 5]. Complex networks pos-
sess many interesting properties. Most complex networks
exhibit small-world traits [6] and are scale free where the
distributions of degrees have power-law tails [7]. In ad-
dition, many real networks have modular structures or

communities [8]. The fourth intriguing feature of some
real networks reported recently is the self-similarity [9].
The studies of complex networks have extensively broad-
ened and deepened our understanding of complex sys-
tems.

In the ﬁeld of chemical engineering, chemical reactions
and transports of mass, energy and momentum have been
the traditional domains for about ﬁve decades, where the
topological properties are of less concerns. Amaral and
Ottino have considered two examples for which the way
constituents of the system are linked determines trans-
port and the dynamics of the system, that is, food webs
and cellular networks [10]. However, these examples are
borrowed from outside of chemical engineering. In this
paper, we present an example of complex technological
network in chemical engineering, studying the topological
properties of the process ﬂow of an ammonia plant.

The network studied here is abstracted from the pro-
cess ﬂow diagram of the Ammonia Plant of Jiujiang
Chemical Fertilizer Plant (Jiangxi Province, China). The
scale of the plant is 1000MT/D. In the construction of
the Ammonia Plant network (AP network), towers, re-
actors, pumps, heat exchangers, and connection points
of convergence and bifurcation of pipes are regarded as
vertices. Only the equipments and pipes carrying raw
materials, by-products, and products are considered in
the construction of network. The utility ﬂows are not
included in the network. The pipes connecting the ver-
tices are treated as edges. The AP network constructed
has 505 vertices and 759 edges. Since the size of the AP
network is small, we ignore the directedness of the edges
to access better statistics.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we inves-

ing power laws

with usually 2 < γ < 3. Several mechanisms of scale
free distributions have been proposed, such as preferen-
tial attachment and its variants [3] and ﬁtness of vertices
[11, 12].

In Fig. 2 is shown the degree distribution of the AP
network in log-log plot. The distribution is unimodal and
the most probable degree is k = 3. The vertex represent-
ing the unit of B-Train has maximum degree of k = 22.
Since there is no vertex whose degree is among 18 to 21,
we re-binned the rightmost two points in the ﬁgure. For
k ≥ 2, the degree distribution exhibits a nice power law
decay with an exponent γ = 2.98 ± 0.67, where the error
is estimated by the r.m.s. of the ﬁt residuals. We see
that the AP network is scale-free.

tigate the main properties of the AP network and show
that the AP network is a small-world network and scale-
free with weak self-similarity. We discuss in Sec. III the
modular structures in the AP network and show that the
resultant AP tree exhibits excellent allometric scaling.
Section IV concludes.

II. MAIN PROPERTIES

A. Small-world eﬀect

The average path length is among the most studied
quantity in complex networks [3, 4, 5]. The shortest path
length l between two arbitrary vertices can be determined
by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. For the AP network,
the average path length is estimated to be hli = 7.76
with a standard deviation σl = 2.65. We ﬁnd that the
distribution of l is a Gaussian, as shown in Fig. 1. The
skewness is 0.17 and the kurtosis excess is 0.01, which
is close to the theoretical value 0 of a Gaussian distri-
bution. The average path length and its ﬂuctuation can
also be estimated by a Gaussian ﬁt to the data, which
presents hli = 7.85 and σl = 2.74. A random graph
with 505 vertices and 759 edges has a much larger aver-
age path length ℓrandom = 15.28 compared with the real
AP network, which indicates that the AP network is a
small-world network [6].

B. Scale-free degree distribution

The degree k of a vertex of a network is the number of
edges connected to that vertex. Degree distributions of
vertices are perhaps the most frequently investigated in
the literature of complex networks [3, 4, 5]. The degree
distributions of scale-free networks have fat tails follow-

C. Clustering coeﬃcient

The clustering coeﬃcient Ci of vertex i is a measure of
the cluster structure indicating how much the adjacent
vertices of the adjacent vertices of i are adjacent vertices
of i. Mathematically, Ci is deﬁned by

where Ei is the number of edges among the adjacent ver-
tices of i [6]. In complex networks, the coeﬃcient Ci as
a function of ki often follows a power law

it is shown that α = 1 [13, 15]. Similar power law behav-
iors have also been found in many real networks, such as
metabolic networks, actors network, semantic web, Inter-
net (at the autonomous system level and at the router
level), World Wide Web, and protein interaction net-
works (PIN) [16, 17, 18].

Figure 3 plots Ci of the AP network as a function
of ki in double logarithmic coordinates. A clear power
law dependence is observed with α = 2.16 ± 0.25, where
the error is estimated by the root-mean-square of the ﬁt
residuals. The correlation coeﬃcient of the linear regres-
sion is 0.97. The average clustering coeﬃcient C = hCii
is 0.083, which is comparable to other technological net-
works [4]. A random graph with 505 vertices and 759
edges has a much smaller average clustering coeﬃcient
C = 0.003 compared with the real AP network, which
gives further evidence supporting that the AP network is
a small-world network [6].

D. Error tolerance against random failures and
intended attacks

The study of tolerance of complex networks against
intended attacks or random failures have not only theo-
retical but also practical signiﬁcance. The impact of in-
tended attacks on scale-free networks is much remarkable
than random failures, while exponential networks (whose
degrees following exponential distributions) have undis-
tinguishable linear tolerance against attacks and random
failures [19]. Since the AP network is scale-free, one ex-
pects that it displays robustness against random failures
but is signiﬁcantly destroyed by intended attacks.

In the robustness analysis, random failures are imple-
mented by removing randomly a fraction f of vertices
from the network and the average path length ℓ of the re-
sultant network is recalculated. For each value of f , this
procedure is repeated 20 times. The resulting averaged ℓ
is plotted as a function of f in Fig. 4. The error bars are

estimated by the standard deviations of ℓ. On the other
hand, intended attacks are performed by discarding ver-
tices with maximum degrees out of the network. The
resultant average path length ℓ of the remaining network
is shown as a function of f in Fig. 4 with asterisks. We
observe that the average path length increases rapidly fol-
lowing the removal of highly connected vertices, while the
increase of ℓ responding to random failure is much slower
and almost linear. This observation is as expected and
gives further support for the claim that the AP network
is scale-free.

E. Weak self-similarity of the AP network

Very recently, Song, Havlin and Makse have reported
that some of real networks exhibit self-similarity while
some others show weak self-similarity [9]. They adopt
the well-established box-counting method for the study
of fractals. For self-similar networks, the number of cov-
ering boxes NB scales with respect to the box size lB as

NB(lB) ∼ l

−D
B ,

(4)

(5)

where D is the fractal dimension. It is noteworthy that
the diameter of a box of size lB is lB − 1 [9]. For weak
self-similar networks, NB scales against ℓB as a modiﬁed
power law

NB(lB) ∼ (lB + lc)

−D ,

where lc is the cutoﬀ. Similar scale invariance in the
degree distributions of coarse-grained networks was re-
vealed in geographically embedded networks on a two-
dimensional square lattice [20]. The signiﬁcance of the
unveiling of symmetry is remarkable in the understand-
ing and exploring of complex networks [21].

We follow the work of Song, Havlin and Makse [9] to
tackle the AP network. Figure 5 shows the dependence of
NB as a function of lB. The strong self-similarity is not
evident from the dashed line, a ﬁt to the data points with
3 ≤ lB ≤ 16 using (4), which has D = 2.65. On the other
hand, a ﬁt to (5) outlines the weak self-similarity of the
AP network, which gives dB = 2.48 and lc = 1.77. Since
the modiﬁed power law (5) shows a faster-than-power-law
decay, we speculate that an exponential or stretched ex-
ponential will better capture the dependence of NB upon
lB. The inset shows the dependence NB as a function of
lB in a semi-log plot. It is interesting to note that the
value of Ds is close to the box dimension D estimated
above. A ﬁt to the exponential

NB(lB) ∼ e

−lB /l0 ,

(6)

gives a characteristic scale l0 = 3.43. This relation is
reminiscent of the results of Zhou, et al. in the study of
social group sizes [22].

NB(lB) for large lB.

To further explore the self-similar feature of the AP
network, we introduce an alternative approach. A net-
work can be regarded as an ego-centric network from the
view of a given vertex, or an ego vertex. The number S
of vertices that have a distance no larger than l from the
ego is determined. An averaged value of S(l) is obtained
by setting all nodes as egos. As shown in Fig. 6, the de-
pendence of S as a function of l shows an evident power
law relation for l up to 9,

S(l) ∼ lDs

(7)

with the scaling exponent Ds = 2.43.

The quantity Ds can also be interpreted as fractal di-
mension, analogous to the DLA models [23]. We con-
struct an ego tree as follows. Starting from an ego ver-
tices, all vertices which are directly linked to the ego

are recognized as daughters of the ego and the daughters
of each daughter of the second generation are identiﬁed
from the remaining vertices. The remaining vertices con-
tains all the vertices that have not been picked in the
previous construction so that no vertex is repeatedly as-
signed to more than one vertex of the higher generation.
This procedure continues till all vertices are attached the
ego tree. An ego tree is an analogue of a DLA cluster
and l is the radium of gyration. In this sense, Ds can
be interpreted as fractal dimension. It is interesting to
note that Ds is close to D. However, we notice that the
ﬂuctuation is quite large. One should thus be cautious
to conclude that the ego trees are self-similar.

III. MODULAR STRUCTURE IN THE AP
NETWORK

A. A brief review

In the recent years, much attention has been attracted
to the modular clusters or community structures of real
networks, such as metabolic networks [16, 24], food webs
[25, 26], social networks [25, 27, 28, 29], to list a few.

There are rigorous deﬁnitions for community. A strong
community is deﬁned as a subgraph of the network re-
quiring more connections within each community than
with the rest of the network, while in a weak community
the total number of connections of within-community
vertices is larger than the number of connections of the
vertices in the community with the rest of the network
[30, 31]. However, in most cases in the literature, commu-
nity is only fuzzily deﬁned in the sense that the connec-
tions within communities are denser than between com-
munities.

Diﬀerent types of algorithms have been developed for
the detection of communities [8]. Sokal and Michener
proposed the average-linkage method [32], which is ex-

tended to the hierarchical clustering algorithm later [33].
In 1995, Frank developed a method for direct identiﬁ-
cation of non-overlapping subgroups [34], which was ap-
plied to detect compartments in food webs [26]. Girvan
and Newman proposed a divisive algorithm that uses
edge betweenness centrality to identify the boundaries
of communities [25, 35], which is now widely known as
GN algorithm. Based on the concept of network ran-
dom walking, Zhou used dissimilarity index to delimit
the boundaries of communities, which is reported to out-
perform the algorithm based on the concept of edge be-
tweenness centrality [36, 37]. An alternative divisive al-
gorithm of Radicchi et al. is based on the edge clustering
coeﬃcient, related to the number of cycles that include
a certain edge [30, 31]. Another well-known algorithm
is Newman’s maximum modularity algorithm, which is a
type of agglomerative algorithm [38, 39].

Many other algorithms have been presented, for in-
stance, the Kernighan-Lin algorim [40], the spectral
method which takes into account weights and link orien-
tations and its improvement [41, 42], the resistor network
approach which concerns the voltage drops [43], the infor-
mation centrality algorithm that consists in ﬁnding and
removing iteratively the edge with the highest informa-
tion centrality [44], a fast community detection algorithm
based on a q-state Potts model [45], an aggregation algo-
rithm for ﬁnding communities of related genes [46], the
maximum modularity algorithm incorporated with simu-
lated annealing [24], the agent-based algorithm [47], the
shell algorithm [48], and the algorithm based on random
Ising model and maximum ﬂow [49].

B. Community structure of the AP network

We apply Newman’s maximum modularity algorithm
[38, 39] to study the community structure of the AP net-
work. The resultant AP tree is illustrated in Fig. 7,
which is not in the form of dendrogram. The shapes
of the vertices represent diﬀerent sections of the process
ﬂow of the AP: SGP section-oil (solid circles), rectisol
section-oil (horizontal ellipses), CO-shift section (vertical
ellipses), synthesis & refrig.
section (open circles), air
separation section (triangles), nitrogen washing section
(vertical diamonds), steam superheater unit (horizontal
diamonds), ammonia storage & tank yard (rectangles),
and equipments of waste treatment (squares). The max-
imum value of the modularity is Q = 0.794, which is
among the largest peak modularity values reported for
diﬀerent networks (if not the largest) and thus indicates
a very strong community structure in the investigated
network.

The modular structures of chemical plant networks do
not come out as a surprise.
In a chemical plant, raw
materials are fed into the process ﬂow network and react
from one section to another successively, although there
are feedbacks from later sections. In general, ﬂows are
denser within a workshop section than between sections.

FIG. 7: (Colour online) Modular structure of the AP network.
The shapes of the vertices represent diﬀerent sections of the
process ﬂow of the Ammonia Plant. This ﬁgure was produced
with Pajek [50].

Therefore, a section is naturally a community. In Fig. 7,
most of the vertices in a given section are recognized to
be members of a same community. The vertices of the
storage and tank yard (rectangles) are the most dispensed
in Fig. 7. This is expected since these tanks are linked
from and to diﬀerent sections in the process, which shows
the power of Newman’s maximum modularity algorithm
for community detection.

C. Allometric scaling of the AP tree

The network shown in Fig. 7 is actually a tree. Trees
exhibit intriguing intrinsic properties other than non-tree
networks, among which is the allometric scaling. Allo-
metric scaling laws are ubiquitous in networking systems
such as metabolism of organisms and ecosystems river
networks, food webs, and so forth [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56,
57]. The original model of the allometric scaling on a
spanning tree was developed by Banavar, Maritan, and
Rinaldo [55]. The spanning tree has one root and many
branches and leaves, and can be rated as directed from
root to leaves. Mathematically, each node of a tree is as-
signed a number 1 and two values Ai and Ci are deﬁned
for each node i in a recursive manner as follows:

and

Ai = X
j

Aj + 1 ,

Ci = X
j

Cj + Ai,

(8a)

(8b)

where j stands for the nodes linked from i [55]. We note
that this C should not be confused with the clustering
coeﬃcient in the rest of this paper.
In a food web, i
is the prey and j’s are its predators (thus the nutrition
ﬂows from i to j’s). The allometric scaling relation is

then highlighted by the power law relation between Ci
and Ai:

C ∼ Aη .

(9)

For spanning trees extracted from transportation net-
works, the power law exponent η is a measure of trans-
portation eﬃciency [55, 57]. The smaller is the value of
η, the more eﬃcient is the transportation. Any spanning
tree can range in principle between two extremes, that is,
the chain-like trees and the star-like trees. A chain tree
has one root and one leaf with no branching. Let’s label
leaf vertex by 1, its father by 2, and so forth. The root is
labelled by n for a chain-like tree of size n. The recursive
relations (8) become Ci = Ci−1 + Ai and Ai = Ai−1 + 1
with termination conditions A1 = C1 = 1. It is easy to
show that Ai = i and Ci = i(i + 1)/2. Asymptotically,
the exponent η = 2− for chain-like trees. For star-like
trees of size n, there are one root and n − 1 leaves di-
rectly connected to the root. We have A = C = 1 for all
the leaves and A = n and C = 2n − 1 for the root. It
follows approximately that η = 1+. Therefore, 1 < η < 2
for all spanning trees.

We note that not all trees have such allometric scal-
ing. Consider for instance the classic Cayley with n
generations where the root is the ﬁrst generation. The
A and C values of the vertices of the same generation
are identical.
If we denote Ai and Ci for the vertices
of the (n + 1 − i)-th generation, the iterative equations
are Ai+1 = 2Ai + 1 and Ci+1 = 2Ci + Ai+1, resulting
in Ai = 2i − 1 and Ci = (i − 1)2i + 1. This leads to
C = [log2(A + 1) − 1]A + log2(A + 1). Obviously, there
is no power-law dependence between A and C.

We apply this framework on the AP tree. The calcu-
lated C is plotted in Fig. 8 as a function of A. A nice
power-law relation is observed between C and A. A lin-
ear ﬁt of ln C against ln A give η = 1.21 with regression
coeﬃcient 0.998. The trivial point (A = 1, C = 1) is
excluded from the ﬁtting [57]. This value of η is slightly
larger than η = 1.13 ∼ 1.16 for food webs [57] but much
smaller than η = 1.5 for river networks [55].

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have studied a complex technological network ex-
tracted from the process ﬂow of the Ammonia Plant of
Jiujiang Chemical Fertilizer Plant in Jiangxi Province
of China. We have shown that the ammonia plant net-
work is a small-world network in the sense that its av-
erage path length hli = 7.76 and global clustering coef-
ﬁcient C = 0.083 are much smaller than their counter-
parts ℓrandom = 15.28 and Crandom = 0.003 of a random
graph having the same numbers of vertices and edges.
We found that the shortest path lengths between two ar-
bitrary vertices are distributed according to a Gaussian
formula. The distribution of degrees follows a power law
with its exponent being γ = 2.97 ± 0.67 for k ≥ 2, indi-
cating that the AP network is scale-free. The clustering

coeﬃcient C(k) of a vertex scales also as a power-law
against the degree k of that vertex with an exponent
of α = 2.16 ± 0.25. We have also shown that the AP
network has strong error tolerance against random fail-
ures and increasing average path length responding to
intended attacks, which is similar to many other scale-
free networks.

We have adopted the box-counting method by tiling
the network with boxes of diﬀerent sizes to address the
question whether the AP network is self-similar. We
found that the number of boxes NB scales as a modi-
ﬁed power law with respect to the box size lB, which
means that the AP network is weakly self-similar. Fur-
ther more, we have seen that the averaged number S(l)
of vertices, whose distances to a given ego vertex is less
than a given value l, has a power-law dependence against
l. This analysis also gives credit to the claim of weak
self-similarity. However, both approaches show that the
claim itself is weak since NB(lB) can also be well ﬁtted
to an exponential and the ﬂuctuations of Sl is large.

We have reviewed brieﬂy diverse existing algorithms
for the detection of community structures in complex
networks, among which Newman’s maximum modularity
algorithm is applied to the AP network. The extracted
modular structures have a very high modularity value
Q = 0.794, which signals the signiﬁcance of the modules.
These modular structures are well explained by the work-
shop sections of the ammonia plant. We have constructed
a spanning tree based on the community identiﬁcation
procedure and found that the resultant AP tree exhibits
excellent allometric scaling with an exponent comparable
to the universal scaling exponent of food webs.

In summary, we have studied the topological proper-
ties of the undirected and unweighted AP network from
chemical engineering. We hope that this work will attract
more aﬀords in this direction. More sophisticated net-
works can be constructed from process ﬂows in chemical
industry. We ﬁgure that researches on complex networks
containing information of transports and reactions will

unveil useful properties and beneﬁt the ﬁeld practically
and theoretically.

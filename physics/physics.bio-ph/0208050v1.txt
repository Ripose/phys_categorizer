Abstract

The thalamus is the major gate to the cortex and its control over
cortical responses is well established. Cortical feedback to the thala-
mus is, in turn, the anatomically dominant input to relay cells, yet its
inﬂuence on thalamic processing has been diﬃcult to interpret. For
an understanding of complex sensory processing, detailed concepts of
the corticothalamic interplay need yet to be established. Drawing on
various physiological and anatomical data, we elaborate the novel hy-
pothesis that the visual cortex controls the spatiotemporal structure of
cortical receptive ﬁelds via feedback to the lateral geniculate nucleus.
Furthermore, we present and analyze a model of corticogeniculate loops
that implements this control, and exhibit its ability of object segmen-
tation by statistical motion analysis in the visual ﬁeld.

Keywords: Lateral geniculate nucleus, Corticothalamic feedback, Control
loop, Object segmentation, Motion analysis.

Introduction

It has long been an intriguing problem that cortical feedback to the thala-
mus is the anatomically dominant input to relay cells, yet the modulation it
eﬀects in their responses seems to be ambiguous. Experiments and theoreti-
cal considerations have suggested a variety of operations of the visual cortex
on the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), such as attention-related gating of

geniculate relay cells (GRCs) (Sherman & Koch, 1986; Koch, 1987), syn-
chronizing ﬁring of GRCs (Sillito et al., 1994; Singer, 1994), increasing mu-
tual information between GRCs’ retinal input and their output (McClurkin
et al., 1994), and switching GRCs from a detection to an analyzing mode
(Sherman & Guillery, 1996; Godwin et al., 1996). Most of the current spec-
ulations, however, fall short of a clear, integrated view of corticothalamic
function. Detailed concepts of the relationship between thalamic and corti-
cal operation still remain to be established so as to advance our ideas about
complex sensory, and ultimately cognitive, processing. In the present article
we provide support for a role of corticogeniculate loops in complex visual
motion processing.

In the A laminae of cat LGN two types of X relay cell have been iden-
tiﬁed that dramatically diﬀer in their temporal response properties (Mas-
tronarde, 1987a; Humphrey & Weller, 1988a; Saul & Humphrey, 1990).
Those that are more delayed in response time and phase have been termed
lagged, the others nonlagged cells (with the exception of very few so-called
partially lagged neurons). In particular, the peak response of lagged neu-
rons to a moving bar is about 100 ms later than that of nonlagged neurons
(Mastronarde, 1987a). Lagged X cells comprise about 40 % of all X re-
lay cells (Mastronarde, 1987a; Humphrey & Weller, 1988b). Physiological
(Mastronarde, 1987b), pharmacological (Heggelund & Hartveit, 1990), and
structural (Humphrey & Weller, 1988b) evidence suggests that rapid feed-
forward inhibition via intrageniculate interneurons plays a decisive role in
shaping the lagged cells’ response. Some authors have additionally related
diﬀerences in receptor types to the lagged-nonlagged dichotomy (Heggelund
& Hartveit, 1990; Hartveit & Heggelund, 1990); see, however, Kwon et al.
(1991).

Layer 4B in cortical area 17 of the cat is the target of both lagged and
nonlagged geniculate X cells (Saul & Humphrey, 1992a; Jagadeesh et al.,
1997; Murthy et al., 1998). The spatiotemporal receptive ﬁelds (RFs) of
its direction-selective simple cells can routinely be interpreted as being com-
posed of subregions that receive geniculate inputs alternating between lagged
and nonlagged X type (Saul & Humphrey, 1992a; Saul & Humphrey, 1992b;
DeAngelis et al., 1995; Jagadeesh et al., 1997; Murthy et al., 1998). At least
for simple cells in layer 4B, this RF structure determines the response to
moving visual features (McLean & Palmer, 1989; Reid et al., 1991; DeAnge-
lis et al., 1995; Jagadeesh et al., 1993; Jagadeesh et al., 1997; Murthy et al.,
1998), and thus the cell’s tuning for direction and speed1.

Certainly, intracortical input to cortical cells contributes to direction-
1To avoid confusion, we point out that the term ‘speed tuning’ is sometimes used in a
more restricted sense. Simple cells exhibit tuning for spatial and temporal frequencies that
results in preference for speeds of moving grids depending on their spatial frequency. Here
we will be concerned with the more natural case of stimuli having a low-pass frequency
content (Field, 1994), speciﬁcally, those composed of local features such as thin bars.

selective responses, given that these inputs anatomically outnumber tha-
lamic inputs (Ahmed et al., 1994). Suggested intracortical eﬀects include
sharpening of tuning properties by suppressive interactions (Reid et al.,
1991; Hirsch et al., 1998; Crook et al., 1998) and ampliﬁcation of geniculate
inputs by recurrent excitation (Douglas et al., 1995; Suarez et al., 1995).
Intracortical circuits can in principle even generate their own direction se-
lectivity by selectively inhibiting responses to nonpreferred motion (Douglas
et al., 1995; Suarez et al., 1995; Maex & Orban, 1996). Our modeling is
complementary to the latter in that we emphasize the inﬂuence of genicu-
late inputs on cortical RF properties that is suggested by numerous studies
(Saul & Humphrey, 1992a; Saul & Humphrey, 1992b; Reid & Alonso, 1995;
Alonso et al., 1996; Ferster et al., 1996; Jagadeesh et al., 1997; Murthy et al.,
1998; Hirsch et al., 1998), in order to bring out eﬀects that are speciﬁc to
the geniculate contribution to spatiotemporal tuning.

Thalamocortical neurons possess a characteristic blend of voltage-gated
ion channels that jointly determine the timing and pattern of Na+ spiking in
response to a sensory stimulus. Depending on the initial membrane polar-
ization, the GRC response to a visual stimulus is in a range between a tonic
and a burst mode (Sherman & Guillery, 1996). At hyperpolarization, a Ca2+
conductance gets de-inactivated and, on activation, promotes burst ﬁring.
Although the issue is still controversial, there is evidence that a mixture
of burst and tonic spikes is involved in the transmission of visual signals in
lightly anesthetized or awake animals (Guido et al., 1992; Guido et al., 1995;
Guido & Weyand, 1995; Mukherjee & Kaplan, 1995; Sherman & Guillery,
1996; Reinagel et al., 1999).
In nonlagged neurons a burst component is
present at resting membrane potentials below roughly -70 mV and consti-
tutes a very early part of a visual response (Lu et al., 1992; Guido et al.,
1992; Mukherjee & Kaplan, 1995). In lagged neurons bursting seems to be
responsible for high-activity transients seen after the oﬀset of feedforward
inhibition; in particular, it is contributing substantially to the delayed peak
response to a moving bar (Mastronarde, 1987b).

Cortical feedback to the A laminae of the LGN, arising mainly from layer
6 of area 17 (Sherman & Guillery, 1996), can locally modulate the response
mode, and hence the timing, of GRCs by shifting their membrane potentials
on a time scale that is long as compared to retinal inputs. This may occur di-
rectly through the action of metabotropic glutamate and NMDA receptors
(depolarization) (McCormick & von Krosigk, 1992; Godwin et al., 1996;
Sherman & Guillery, 1996) and indirectly via the perigeniculate nucleus
(PGN) or geniculate interneurons by activation of GABAB receptors (hy-
perpolarization) of GRCs (Crunelli & Leresche, 1991; Sherman & Guillery,
1996). Indeed, GRCs in vivo are dynamic and diﬀer individually in their de-
gree of burstiness (Lu et al., 1992; Guido et al., 1992; Mukherjee & Kaplan,
1995). Here we explicate the causal link between the variable response tim-
ing of GRCs and variable tuning of cortical simple cells for speed of moving

features, thus identifying control of speed tuning as a likely mode of corti-
cothalamic operation. Moreover, we exemplify the computational power of
the hypothesized control mechanism in a model of corticogeniculate loops
that performs object segmentation based on motion cues.

Geniculate input to the cortex

The ﬁrst object of our study is the geniculate input to a cortical neuron in
layer 4B.

Model of the primary visual pathway

For the GRCs we have employed a 12-channel model of the cat relay neuron
(Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick & Huguenard, 1992), adapted
to 37 degrees Celsius. It includes a transient and a persistent Na+ current,
several voltage-gated K+ currents, a voltage- and Ca2+-gated K+ current,
a low- and a high-threshold Ca2+ current, a hyperpolarization-activated
mixed cation current, and Na+ and K+ leak conductances. As shown in
Fig. 1a, retinal input reaches a GRC directly as excitation, and indirectly
via an intrageniculate interneuron as inhibition, thus establishing the typi-
cal triadic synaptic circuit found in the glomeruli of X GRCs (Sherman &
Guillery, 1996). The temporal diﬀerence between the two aﬀerent pathways
equals the delay of the inhibitory synapse and has been taken to be 1.0 ms
(Mastronarde, 1987b).

It is known that both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors contribute to
retinogeniculate excitation to varying degrees, ranging from almost pure
non-NMDA to almost pure NMDA mediated responses in individual GRCs
of both lagged and nonlagged varieties (Kwon et al., 1991). At least in
lagged cells, however, early responses and, hence, responses to the transient
stimuli that will be considered here, seem to depend to a lesser degree on
the NMDA receptor type than late responses (Kwon et al., 1991). Since the
essential characteristics of lagged and nonlagged responses apparently do
not depend on the special properties of NMDA receptors – an assumption
conﬁrmed by our results – we chose the postsynaptic conductances in GRCs
to be of the non-NMDA type.

The time course of postsynaptic conductance change in GRCs following

reception of an input has been modeled by an alpha function,

and inhibitory geniculate synapses (Mastronarde, 1987b) and was found to
reproduce the rise times of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials recorded in
relay cells following stimulation of the optic chiasm (Bloomﬁeld & Sherman,
1988). The reversal potentials are for excitation 0 mV, for inhibition −85.8
mV (Bal et al., 1995).

We have found typical lagged responses for strong feedforward inhibition
with weak feedforward excitation, in agreement with Mastronarde (1987b),
Humphrey & Weller (1988b), and Heggelund & Hartveit (1990). On the
other hand, typical nonlagged responses are produced by weak feedforward
inhibition with strong feedforward excitation; see Fig. 2. We have therefore
implemented lagged and nonlagged relay cells in the model by varying the
relative strengths of feedforward excitation and feedforward inhibition. For
an explanation of lagged and nonlagged responses see the results below.

The model system comprises 100 lagged and 100 nonlagged relay neu-
rons. Their RF centers are 0.5 degrees in diameter (Cleland et al., 1979) and
are spatially arranged in a lagged and a nonlagged clusters subtending 0.7
degrees each and displaced by 0.45 degrees; see Fig. 1b. This layout matches
the basic structure of an on or oﬀ region in a RF of a directional simple cell
in cortical layer 4B onto which the GRCs are envisaged to project (Saul
& Humphrey, 1992a; Saul & Humphrey, 1992b; DeAngelis et al., 1995; Ja-
gadeesh et al., 1997; Murthy et al., 1998). To complete the geniculate input
to a RF of this type, this lagged-nonlagged unit would have to be repeated
with alternating on-oﬀ polarity and a spatial oﬀset that would determine
the simple cell’s preference for some spatial frequency. Since we are not
concerned here with eﬀects of spatial frequency (see previous footnote 1),
omission of the other on/oﬀ regions does not aﬀect our conclusions. Results
for rescaled RF geometries can be derived straightforwardly; see the results
below. The number of geniculate cells contributing to the simple cell’s RF
has been estimated roughly from Ahmed et al. (1994). Only its order of
magnitude matters.

We have also taken into account feedback inhibition via the PGN (Lo
& Sherman, 1994; Sherman & Guillery, 1996); see Fig. 1a. Connections
between PGN neurons and GRCs are all to all within, and separate for the
lagged and nonlagged populations. Axonal plus synaptic delays are 2.0 ms
in both directions.

Intrageniculate interneurons and PGN cells, like GRCs, posses a com-
plex blend of ionic currents. They are, however, thought to be active mainly
in a tonic spiking mode during the awake state (Contreras et al., 1993; Pape
et al., 1994). For an eﬃcient usage of computational resources and time we
have therefore modeled these neurons by the spike-response model (Gerst-
ner & van Hemmen, 1992), which gives a reasonable approximation to tonic
spiking (Kistler et al., 1997). Note that for the present model it is irrelevant
whether transmission across dendrodendritic synapses between intragenicu-
late interneurons and GRCs actually occurs with or without spikes; cf. Cox

Figure 2: Numerical simulation of moving-bar response of single relay neu-
rons. Typical nonlagged (top row) and lagged (bottom row) responses to
a bar moving at 4 deg/s (100 sweeps averaged, bin width 5 ms) have been
reproduced by relay neurons in the LGN model (Fig. 1a) at the two rest-
ing membrane potentials −61 mV (dashed line) and −72 mV (solid line).
The vertical line in the center of the plots indicates the time of the reti-
nal input peak. As the membrane is hyperpolarized, the nonlagged bar-
response peak shifts to earlier times. Conversely, the lagged response shifts
to later times. The nonlagged responses are produced by strong feedfor-
ward excitation [gsyn = 0.05µS; cf. eqn. (1)] and weak feedforward inhibi-
tion (gsyn = 0.0125µS), whereas the lagged responses correspond to weak
feedforward excitation (gsyn = 0.0125µS) and strong feedforward inhibition
(gsyn = 0.25µS). The numerical values of gsyn are not critical. The response
timing is consistent with experiments (Mastronarde, 1987a; Lu et al., 1992;
Guido et al., 1992). Furthermore, we have found the temporal transfer
functions (not shown) to agree well with published data (Saul & Humphrey,
1990; Mukherjee & Kaplan, 1995).

et al. (1998). For a relay neuron, all that matters is the fact that an excita-
tory retinal input is mostly followed by an inhibitory input (Bloomﬁeld &
Sherman, 1988). The spike-response neurons have been given an adaptive
spike output (Gerstner & van Hemmen, 1992), i.e., there is adaptation of
transmission across the dendrodendritic synapses.

We have incorporated the inﬂuence of cortical feedback to the thala-
mus by varying the K+ leak conductivity of GRCs, which in turn controls
their resting membrane potential (McCormick & von Krosigk, 1992; God-
win et al., 1996); see Fig. 1a. All GRCs, lagged and nonlagged, have been
assigned the same resting membrane potential; here we assume a uniform
action of cortical feedback on the scale of single RFs in area 17. By varying
the resting membrane potential we investigate a strictly modulatory role of
corticogeniculate feedback, as opposed to the retinal inputs that drive relay
cells to ﬁre; cf. Sherman & Guillery (1996), Crick & Koch (1998).

The model is described by a high-dimensional system of nonlinear, cou-
pled diﬀerential equations (Huguenard & McCormick, 1992; McCormick &
Huguenard, 1992). The input to GRCs was modeled as a set of Poisson spike
trains with time-varying ﬁring rates as recorded from retinal ganglion cells
in response to moving, thin (0.1 degrees), long (10 degrees) bars (Cleland &
Harding, 1983). For numerical integration of the stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tions we used an adaptive ﬁfth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm. The dynamics
of spike-response neurons has been solved by exact integrals. Simulations
were run on an IBM SP2 parallel computer.

We collected spike times with 0.1 ms resolution. For each velocity v of bar
motion tested, spikes of all 100 lagged/nonlagged relay cells were pooled. We
calculated the total lagged/nonlagged response rates rl(v, t)/rnl(v, t) as spike
counts in 5 ms windows, a timescale relevant to postsynaptic integration,
shifted by steps of 1 ms, i.e., t = 1, 2, . . . ms. The velocity tuning of the
pooled lagged/nonlagged peak rate per neuron is

Rℓ(v) =

ℓ = l, nl ,

t∈[ti,tf ]

where the times ti and tf are chosen such that all responses lie in the interval
[ti, tf ].

We are primarily interested in the total geniculate input to a cortical sim-
ple cell. To this end, we have shifted lagged spikes by 2 ms to later times in
order to account for the fact that the lagged cells’ conduction times to cortex
are slightly longer than those of the nonlagged cells (Mastronarde, 1987a;
Humphrey & Weller, 1988a). Furthermore, although lagged responses in
the LGN tend to be weaker than nonlagged responses (Mastronarde, 1987a;
Humphrey & Weller, 1988a; Saul & Humphrey, 1990), they appear to be
about equally eﬀective in driving cortical simple cells (Saul & Humphrey,
1992a). The cortical (possibly synaptic) cause being beyond the scope of
this work, we simply have counted every lagged spike twice to obtain the

velocity tuning of the eﬀective geniculate input to a cortical cell,

R(v) =

t∈[ti,tf ]

[2 rl(v, t − 2 ms) + rnl(v, t)] .

(3)

The peak input rate per lagged-nonlagged pair R(v) is correlated with
simple-cell activity because postsynaptic potentials are summed almost lin-
early in simple cells (Jagadeesh et al., 1993; Kontsevich, 1995; Jagadeesh
et al., 1997).

The total geniculate input rate to a cortical neuron depends on (i) the
magnitude of the pooled lagged and nonlagged response peaks, Rl(v) and
Rnl(v), respectively, and (ii) their relative timing. To diﬀerentiate between
these two factors we have determined the times tl(v) and tnl(v) of the max-
ima of the lagged and nonlagged response rates, respectively,

tℓ(v) = arg max
t∈[ti,tf ]

rℓ(v, t) ,

ℓ = l, nl ,

(4)

and calculated the peak-time diﬀerences tnl(v) − tl(v) as a function of the
bar velocity. Means and standard errors have been estimated from a sample
of 30 sweeps at each bar velocity.

Results for geniculate input to the cortex

For diﬀerent values of the resting membrane potential, Fig. 3 shows in the
columns from left to right the velocity tuning of the lagged population (Rl),
of the nonlagged population (Rnl), the peak-time diﬀerences (tnl − tl) of
their responses for the preferred direction, and the tuning of the total genic-
ulate input (R) to a cortical cell for the preferred and nonpreferred direction
of motion; see above for details. As in vivo, the lagged cells prefer lower
velocities and have lower peak ﬁring rates than the nonlagged cells (Mas-
tronarde, 1987a; Humphrey & Weller, 1988a; Saul & Humphrey, 1990). The
key observation, however, is that the maximum of the total geniculate input
rate to a cortical neuron shifts to lower velocities as the membrane potential
hyperpolarizes; see Fig. 3 right column.

The total geniculate input rate R assumes its maximum at a velocity of
bar motion where the peak discharges of the lagged and nonlagged neurons
coincide, i.e., where tnl − tl ≈ 0. The shift of the maximum with hyper-
polarization to lower velocities is produced by a corresponding shift of the
peak-time diﬀerences tnl − tl and of the lagged tuning Rl, while the peak
of the nonlagged tuning Rnl remains essentially unchanged. As is demon-
strated in Fig. 2, the change in peak-time diﬀerence is due to (i) a shift of
the lagged response peak to later times, and (ii) a shift of the nonlagged
response peak to earlier times.

The reason for the opposite shifts of lagged and nonlagged response tim-
ing lies in the interaction of the low-threshold Ca2+ current with the diﬀerent

Figure 3: Numerical simulation of geniculate moving-bar response and input
to cortex. Velocity tuning and timing of the response peaks have been
plotted for resting membrane potentials indicated on the far left.
In the
columns we show from left to right as functions of the bar velocity the peak
response rate of the lagged population (Rl), of the nonlagged population
(Rnl), their peak-time diﬀerence (tnl − tl) for the preferred direction, and the
peak of the total geniculate input (R) to a cortical cell for the preferred (solid
line) and nonpreferred (dotted line) direction of motion. The horizontal axes
show the logarithm (base 2) of speed in all graphs. The bars in the graphs
are standard errors. As the membrane is hyperpolarized, the total geniculate
input to a cortical cell, and hence that cortical cell, prefer progressively lower
velocities. Means and standard errors are estimated from 30 bar sweeps.

levels of inhibition received by lagged and nonlagged neurons. With only
weak feedforward inhibition, nonlagged neurons respond to retinal input
with immediate depolarization, eventually reaching the activation threshold
for the Ca2+ current.
If the Ca2+ current is in the de-inactivated state,
it will boost depolarization and give rise to an early burst component of
the visual response (Lu et al., 1992; Guido et al., 1992). The lower the
resting membrane potential, the more de-inactivated the Ca2+ current will
be, and the stronger the early response component relative to the late tonic
component. In an ensemble of neurons that receive retinal input at slightly
diﬀerent times, like the 100 nonlagged neurons with spatially scattered RFs
(cf. Fig. 1b), this leads to a gradual shift of the ensemble-response maximum
with membrane polarization. Lagged neurons, on the other hand, receive

10

strong feedforward inhibition and, hence, initially respond to retinal input
with hyperpolarization. Repolarization occurs when inhibition gets weaker
due to declining retinal input rate or adaptation of the inhibitory input.
With the Ca2+ current being de-inactivated by the excursion of the mem-
brane potential to low values, lagged spiking starts with burst spikes as soon
as the voltage reaches the Ca2+-activation threshold. This will take longer,
if the resting membrane potential is lower, leading to the observed shift in
response timing with membrane polarization.

Not surprisingly, the total geniculate input rate R is higher for the di-
rection of bar motion where tnl − tl assumes lower values. In other words,
the direction preferred is the one where the lagged cells receive their retinal
input before the nonlagged cells; cf. Figs. 1b and 3 right column.

We have investigated the geniculate input to simple cells, which clearly
cannot be compared with their output directly. Nonetheless it is interesting
to note that, much like velocity tuning in areas 17 and 18 (Orban et al.,
1981), the modeled geniculate input at the optimal velocity decreases and
the tuning width increases with decreasing optimal velocity; see Fig. 3 right
column.

Because of scaling properties of the retinal ganglion cells’ velocity tuning
(Cleland & Harding, 1983), rescaled versions of the RF geometry shown in
Fig. 1b produce accordingly shifted tuning curves (on a logarithmic speed
scale). In particular, we retrieve the positive correlation between RF size
and preferred speed found in areas 17 and 18 (Orban et al., 1981) from the
geniculate input.

The corticogeniculate loop

Once a dynamic gating mechanism for thalamocortical information transfer
has been identiﬁed, one has to face the key question of how gating can be
controlled. The computational goal of this control should certainly be an
enhanced cortical representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli, generally
referred to as objects, and suppression of less signiﬁcant bits, such as neu-
ronal noise and incoherent background motion. The general idea of object
segmentation by adaptive velocity tuning is illustrated in Fig. 4. Since many
details of corticothalamic circuits are not known yet and since we aim at a
thorough analytical treatment of the closed-loop system for general stimulus
statistics we have kept the modeling at this point at a more abstract level
than in the above case. Moreover, the underlying principles are best exposed
by a simple model.

Figure 4: The rationale of object segmentation by adaptive velocity tuning.
The tuning curves shown at the top of the ﬁgure schematically represent the
peak response rates of (four) cortical neurons as a function of the speed of a
local feature passing their receptive ﬁeld in an unadapted state (top left) and
an adapted state (top right). Within some region of the visual ﬁeld a natural
stimulus consists of a collection of local features (depicted as dots, center)
moving from left to right and from right to left at various speeds (depicted
as arrows). A subset of them is moving at a common speed from left to
right. The velocity density (bottom) of this type of stimulus consists of two
components: one symmetrical with respect to the two directions of motion
and one asymmetrical. The former derives from the incoherent, the latter
from the coherent motion and is the statistical signature of a moving object.
The adaptive motion system has to detect and tune in to the asymmetrical
component of the velocity density. After adaptation of cortical velocity
tuning (top right), object features are prominent in cortical representation,
whereas other features are suppressed (center right). The given stimulus
scenario generalizes straightforwardly to motion in two dimensions.

that is, an alpha function. We are interested here speciﬁcally in the slow,
modulatory eﬀect of cortical input, mediated by NMDA and metabotropic
glutamate receptors in the case of depolarization, and by GABAB recep-
tors for hyperpolarization. The rise time τ for combinations of NMDA and
metabotropic glutamate receptor responses and for GABAB receptor re-
sponses may be several 100 ms (von Krosigk et al., 1999), but is kept as a
free parameter in the model, i.e., we do not specify a numerical value for
τ throughout the analysis. We neglect corticothalamic delays, which are at
least one order of magnitude smaller than τ . In particular, for layer 6 pro-
jection neurons that are visually responsive and thus relevant to our model,
they are mostly below 10 ms (Tsumoto et al., 1978; Tsumoto & Suda, 1980).
One can show that the inclusion of an adequate distribution of delays does
not alter the general dynamic behavior of the system, but merely adds small
corrections to some characteristic quantities.

As illustrated by Fig. 4, cortical feedback signals that carry information
on local velocity measurements need to be sampled from an extended visual
ﬁeld, spanning several RFs of cells in the primary visual cortex. Lateral
spread of information may be implemented either by intracortical connec-
tions, or by divergence in the corticogeniculate feedback pathway; cf. Fig. 5
right. Let us label all events of cortical responses to local features within the
entire population of layer 6 neurons that feed back onto GRCs by an index
i according to their temporal order, i.e., t1 < t2 < . . .. Let furthermore N(t)
be the number of such events until time t. The slow dynamics of a GRC’s
membrane potential under cortical control then is

V (t) =

Ai PSP(t − ti) + V0 ,

(6)

N(t)

i=1
X

where Ai is the amplitude of the ith event of cortical feedback that depends
on the ﬁring rate of a layer 6 neuron at time ti. In this formulation the size
of the layer 6 population in the adaptive system, and hence of the visual ﬁeld
from which motion information is integrated, is represented by the number
of response events per time: the rate of events increases with the area from
which motion is sampled.

Superimposed on the slow, cortically controlled dynamics [eqn. (6)] of
GRCs’ membrane potentials is the relatively fast dynamics triggered by
retinal input. The retinal input and its consequences have been the subject
of study above. In the present model the dynamics of retinal input will not
enter explicitly. Instead, we now care only for its cortical eﬀect, that is, for
cortical velocity tuning.

13

Cortical response rates in layer 4 to moving visual features such as
bars are assumed to follow some kind of velocity-tuning function. We have
demonstrated above that the velocity that produces the maximal convergent
input from lagged and nonlagged geniculate relay cells is, not surprisingly,
close to the velocity that yields coincident lagged and nonlagged response
peaks, corresponding to tnl(v) − tl(v) ≈ 0; cf. Fig. 3 third column. In this
spirit we deﬁne a layer 4 cell’s response rate to a feature moving with velocity
v into the cell’s preferred direction as

R = f [|tnl(v) − tl(v)|] ,

(7)

where f is some positive, monotonically decreasing function. For analytical
treatment there will be some further restriction on f, to be formulated below.
Moreover, we assume layer 4 cells not to respond to features moving in their
null direction.

By looking at Fig. 3 third column, we see that the simulation data are

roughly consistent with

(8)

(9)

[tnl − tl] (v, V ) = s(v) − c(V ) ,

where s and c are monotonically decreasing functions of the stimulus velocity
v and the relay cells’ membrane potential V , respectively. This approxima-
tion seems to be better at higher membrane potentials. Velocity tuning is
thus given by

R = f [|s(v) − c(V )|] .

Note that this family of functions is rather general in that it ﬁts a large set
of velocity-tuning characteristics.

To obtain a physical interpretation of s(v) and c(V ), we note that the
naive understanding of the velocity-dependence of tnl(v) − tl(v) is that it
arises from the visual feature crossing the lagged-nonlagged compound RF
(see Fig. 1b) in a time proportional to 1/v. Rewriting eqn. (8) as

c(V ) = tl − (tnl − s) ,

(10)

it is evident that if s is the time it takes the visual feature to travel from
the lagged RFs to the nonlagged RFs, c is the diﬀerence in response times
intrinsic to the lagged and nonlagged populations. Appealing to this inter-
pretation, we will write

si := s(vi) , RTD(t) := c[V (t)] , Ri := f [|si − RTD(ti)|] ,

(11)

and refer to si as the stimulus passage time and to RTD(t) as the (dynamic)
response time diﬀerence between the lagged and nonlagged populations. As
above, the index i enumerates the cortical response events in temporal order.
The response of a layer 4 neuron is thus maximal, if the stimulus passage
time equals the lagged-nonlagged response time diﬀerence.

14

We will use the simplest approximation for the dependence of the re-

sponse time diﬀerence on the membrane potential,

RTD(t) = χV (t) + RTD0 ,

(12)

that is, a linear function of V with slope χ and oﬀset RTD0.

In order to close the corticogeniculate loop, and the system of equations,
we need a transformation of the layer 4 responses Ri to the feedback sig-
nals of layer 6 cells, which in turn determine the amplitudes of postsynaptic
potentials Ai in GRCs. To this end, we have analyzed a simple implemen-
tation of cortical control. The rationale is that each cortical response Ri
to a stimulus si triggers a postsynaptic potential of amplitude Ai through
feedback, either directly (depolarization, Ai > 0), or via the PGN or genic-
ulate interneurons (hyperpolarization, Ai < 0), such that the response time
diﬀerence RTD(t) is pulled closer to the stimulus passage time si.

For the computation of the feedback signal a layer 4 cell’s response activ-
ity serves as a measure of the amount of mismatch between RTD(ti) and si:
low activity indicates large mismatch, high activity signals a good match [cf.
eqn. (9)]. The sign of mismatch is computed by comparing the outputs of
layer 4 cells preferring the same direction but diﬀerent speeds, correspond-
ing to diﬀerent values of V0 in eqn. (6). A simple network of spike-response
neurons, shown in Fig. 5 left, approximates these principles and provides
the corresponding feedback signals to the LGN. More precisely, computer
simulations of this network show that

Ai ≈ γ A(Ri) σ(R>

i − R<

i ) ,

(13)

i , R<

where A is some positive, monotonically decreasing function, σ is a sigmoidal
function running between −1 and +1, and R>
i are response rates of
layer 4 cells tuned to higher and lower speeds than the cell producing the
response Ri. The factor γ describes the overall strength of cortical feedback
to the LGN. Eqn. (13) is the relation we used between layer 4 responses
and amplitudes of GRC potentials. Note that it is the result of a simple
transformation of the layer 4 activity to the feedback signals of layer 6
cells; cf. Fig. 5 left. Although a LGN-layer-4-layer-6-LGN loop of synaptic
connections is indeed supported by anatomical data (Katz, 1987; Sherman
& Guillery, 1996), our aim was primarily to investigate a network as simple
as possible that can do the necessary computation.

For the above control mechanism to work, sets of cortical layer 4 neu-
rons are required that have overlapping RFs and diﬀer in speed tuning. It
is not necessary, but conceptually most straightforward, to assume the same
set of n classes of neurons, deﬁned by the initial values V (c)
[cf. eqn. (6)],
c = 1, 2, . . . , n, of their membrane potentials, to represent each retinal lo-
cation. Furthermore, we want to restrict our attention to cortical neurons
that prefer one out of two opposite directions of motion. For each class c of

Figure 5: Model of corticogeniculate loop. Same conventions as in Fig. 1a.
The thick circles symbolize all geniculate relay cells (GRCs), lagged and
nonlagged, which project to a particular cortical layer 4 cell (cf. Fig. 1b), as
indicated by the long upward arrows. On the left we show a local piece of
circuit (Local circuit). The cells depicted here in layer 4 have coinciding
receptive ﬁelds, the same preferred direction but diﬀerent preferred speed
of motion, as indicated by the arrows of diﬀerent length (a longer arrow
means a higher preferred speed). The temporal responses of these cells to a
moving feature have diﬀerent rate amplitudes (top; amplitudes R>, R, R<).
Cortical feedback to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), originating from
layer 6, modulates the membrane potential of GRCs. Direct feedback depo-
larizes, indirect feedback via the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) or geniculate
interneurons hyperpolarizes the membrane of relay cells. The net eﬀect is a
slow postsynaptic potential of amplitude A in GRCs (bottom). Simulation
of the local circuit shows that A is well-described by eqn. (13). The dashed
parts of the local circuit indicate the analogous connections that feed back
to GRCs which provide input to the other local layer 4 neurons. At the right
of the ﬁgure we sketch the global, or long-range, connectivity of the system
(Global circuit). The local circuit, shown here only for one speed-tuned
layer 4 neuron, is replicated for diﬀerent retinal positions and two opposite
directions of motion (arrows). Local circuits with identical speed tuning in
layer 4 are globally interconnected by divergence in the feedback pathway.
Excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the GRCs are interchanged for feedback
from cortical neurons with opposite direction preferences, as indicated once
for each type of feedback connection by the solid arrows. Because of the
long-range connections, each GRC receives modulatory input from cortical
cells jointly representing an extended visual ﬁeld, with antagonism between
the two direction populations. Note that, rather than by divergence in the
corticogeniculate projection, the same function could alternatively be im-
plemented by lateral intracortical connections.

16

cortical neurons there are two variants selective for the two opposite direc-
tions, to be labeled by the superscripts (c, +) and (c, −). The interaction
between the “+” and the “−” population is taken to be such that features
moving in opposite directions elicit PSP amplitudes Ai of opposite signs in
each GRC. This kind of antagonism ensures that the average adaptation to
incoherent, directionally unbiased motion is zero and, hence, is vital to ob-
ject segmentation; cf. Fig. 4. We will label the direction of a moving object
by “+” and the opposite direction by “−”.

Counting stimulus passage times si as positive in the “+” and negative
in the “−” direction, the complete system dynamics is described by the
equations

In the last equation one may deﬁne c0 ≡ c1 and cn+1 ≡ cn to deal with the
lowest and highest values of the class index. The stimulus passage times
si and the times ti of the cortical responses are stochastic variables and
depend on the statistics of the stimulus. Adaptation of velocity tuning and
the dynamics of cortical responses are thus described as a stochastic process
driven by the stimulus. Figure 5 attempts to give a picture of the complete
system of corticothalamic loops.

The precise shapes of the functions f, A, and σ are unimportant, as long
as the combination A ◦ f can be approximated reasonably well by a linear
function within a relevant range of values. A full analytical treatment is

Results for the corticogeniculate loop

A detailed mathematical analysis will be published elsewhere. Here we de-
scribe the main results in the form of prose and present computer simulations
for illustration.

When the system is stimulated by a coherently moving object on a back-
ground of incoherent, directionally unbiased motion, the layer 4 cells’ pref-
erences approach the velocity of the object. This results in an enhanced
representation of a coherent object and suppression of background features
moving at diﬀerent velocities, in accordance with the scheme formulated in
Fig. 4. More speciﬁcally, with an absent or just a sparse background, the re-
sponse time diﬀerences RTD(c,+)(t), i.e., the preferences of neurons encoding
motion in the object’s direction, settle in a stationary state close to the ob-
ject’s passage time; see Fig. 6 top. As background is added to the stimulus,
ongoing oscillations of the neurons’ preferences develop. These oscillations
are more pronounced with a stronger background; see Fig. 6 middle and
bottom. In other words, with a dense background, the dynamics is oscilla-
tory and alternating between phases of close and poor matching of velocity
preferences to the object’s velocity; see Fig. 6 bottom. We suggest to call
the latter phenomenon a diﬀusion-sustained oscillation, emphasizing the
diﬀusion-like drive away from a stationary state that is due to background
features.

The response time diﬀerences RTD(c,±)(t) of all layer 4 neurons in the
system are correlated, both across space and class c. The correlation across
space is the result of the lateral connectivity of the system; cf. Fig. 5 right.
The correlation across classes is mediated by the stimulus; cf. Fig. 6. In par-
ticular, neurons of all classes (c, +) are well tuned to an object’s speed at the
same time. At such times, therefore, object features elicit strong responses
in neurons of all classes (c, +), yielding a high class-averaged response,

hR+i :=

R(c,+) ;

(20)

n

c=1
X

cf. eqn. (15). At other times the preferences of neurons not only are untuned
with respect to the object, but also vary signiﬁcantly across neurons of
diﬀerent classes c. Hence there are no strong class-averaged responses hR+i,
neither to an object, nor to background features.

In turns out that each time course of adaptation is associated with a
certain spatiotemporal pattern of cortical activity. For an adaptation time
course such as shown at the top of Fig. 6, there are permanent strong class-
averaged responses hR+i to object features as soon as the RTDs have con-
verged to the object’s passage time. On the other hand, an oscillatory time
course as shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure is associated with alternating
phases of weak and strong responses hR+i, the strong responses being re-
stricted to object features. In fact, the dynamic RTDs act as a pacemaker
for distributed cortical activity. A periodic time structure is imposed that
tends to synchronize the ﬁring of layer 4 cells representing the object; see
Fig. 7. Oscillations may show up in cortical single cell activity or in multi-
unit activity, depending on the nature of the stimulus and the size of RFs.

Figure 6: Computer simulations of the adaptation dynamics for the response
time diﬀerences RTD(c,±)(t) of 4 classes of neurons (c = 1, 2, 3, 4). Their re-
ceptive ﬁelds are arranged in an array of 60 × 60 retinal locations with 8
neurons per location. The time scale is set by τ , the rise time of corticotha-
lamic postsynaptic potentials; cf. eqn. (5). The stimulus is a coherently
moving object (15 dots) without a background (top), with a moderate back-
ground (10 dots, middle), and with a strong background (30 dots, bottom).
Background dots move at various random speeds, exceeding or less than
the object’s speed, in or opposite to the direction of object motion; cf. Fig.
4. Only the 4 trajectories RTD(c,+)(t), i.e., representative of the neurons
selective for the direction of object motion, are shown. The passage time of
object dots is indicated by the straight horizontal line in each graph. The
adaptation dynamics converges to a stationary state close to the object’s
passage time without a background, and is increasingly oscillatory with in-
creasing background strength. The feedback strength is γ = 0.03 for the
no-background case, and γ = 0.25 for the two other cases.

In particular, single neurons show periodic activity, if their responses last
longer than one period of oscillation of the RTDs. Their response then
comprises several “elementary” response events of the kind marked by a
single dot in Fig. 7. The period scales with the rise time τ of the corti-
cothalamic postsynaptic potentials [see eqn. (5)], and decreases to zero as
the stimulus velocity or density becomes very large. Hence, the period can
be much shorter than the duration of individual corticothalamic PSPs and
even than their rise time τ . The reason is that for a stimulus consisting of

19

features moving at diﬀerent velocities, PSPs are not initiated in isolation
but superimposed upon other PSPs of opposite signs.

It is worth noting that a stationary stimulus background and neuronal
noise are special cases of directionally unbiased background activity. The
system thus also performs segmentation of an object moving across a sta-
tionary background and suppression of neuronal noise.

In the present context of stochastic dynamical systems, stability of the
dynamics means that at least the ﬁrst two moments (the mean and the
variance) of the RTDs converge to ﬁnite values.
It can be proved that
stability is guaranteed, if γ, the overall strength of cortical feedback to the
LGN [cf. eqn. (13)], is not too large.

To summarize, in this model corticogeniculate loops give rise to object
segmentation based on global sampling of velocity features in the visual ﬁeld.
Visual features acquire an enhanced representation in the adaptive motion
system by virtue of belonging to a coherent object. The temporal structure
of adaptation and, hence, of cortical activity, depends on the statistics of
stimulus and noise. With oscillatory dynamics, diﬀerent objects detected
by populations of neurons tuned to diﬀerent directions of motion turn out
to be represented through statistically independent phases of oscillation; cf.
Gray et al. (1989). The model can be extended so as to include higher
visual areas and in such a way that phases of oscillation become statistically
independent for diﬀerent two-dimensional (2D) directions of motion, i.e., the
true directions not accessible to single area 17 cells.

As a consequence of the described dynamics, the control loop for speed
preferences recruits neuronal hardware for object representation in a very
economic manner in that it avoids at the same time neurons that remain
idle and neurons that respond to irrelevant features.

Discussion

Recently it has been proposed that corticogeniculate feedback modulates
the spatial layout of simple-cell RFs by exploiting the thalamic burst-tonic
transition of relay modes (W¨org¨otter et al., 1998). Along a similar line,
the main point made by the ﬁrst part of our modeling is that one should
expect a modulatory inﬂuence of cortical feedback on the spatiotemporal RF
structure of simple cells. More precisely, we observe a shift in the time to
the bar-response peak that is opposite for lagged and nonlagged cells; cf.
Fig. 2. Assuming (i) an RF layout as usually found for direction-selective
simple cells in V1, and (ii) an inﬂuence of convergent geniculate lagged and
nonlagged inputs on this RF structure, it follows that the observed shifts in
response timing aﬀect cortical speed tuning. To the best of our knowledge,
nobody has looked for such an eﬀect yet.

Figure 7: Spatiotemporal pattern of cortical activity in the 60 × 60 retino-
topic array of neurons associated with the adaptation dynamics depicted at
the bottom of Fig. 6, re-displayed at the bottom of this ﬁgure. The system is
stimulated by 15 dots placed on a circle, all moving at a common velocity to
the right (object), and 30 dots moving at various random speeds, exceeding
or less than the object’s speed, either to the left or to the right; cf. Fig. 4.
Whenever the neurons’ preferences, i.e., response time diﬀerences (RTDs),
get close to the object’s passage time (corresponding to the object’s speed),
object dots elicit a strong response in neurons that represent their actual
retinal positions. The corresponding array of activity is shown in the panels
at the top of the ﬁgure. The lower row of panels displays all responses that
occur within the indicated intervals of time; the upper row displays only
those responses where the class-averaged activity hR+i [see eqn. (20)] for
a location exceeds a certain threshold. Nearly all supra-threshold activity
is related to object features, demonstrating the segmentation of the object
against the background. Spurious supra-threshold activity derives from re-
sponses to background dots that by chance have speeds very close to the
object’s speed. The supra-threshold activity is oscillatory and synchronous.
If τ , the rise time of corticothalamic postsynaptic potentials [cf. eqn. (5)],
is taken to be 100 ms, the oscillation frequency is roughly 25 Hz in this
example.

21

model of the corticogeniculate loop demonstrates what such an eﬀect in
the brain may be good for. We have attacked the fundamental sensory
task of object segmentation and analyzed a simple implementation of a
control loop based on abundant structures of the visual system. The basic
idea is to select an important, object-related component of motion. The
loop mechanism eﬀectively draws samples of moving features from a retinal
region and adapts to the mean of those velocities that are more frequent
in one direction than in the opposite, that is, it adapts to an asymmetric
peak in the allover velocity density. Such peaks will usually be produced
by objects moving over a background; cf. Fig. 4. Features moving at the
corresponding velocity acquire an enhanced representation.

The proposed adaptation mechanism could be characterized as pre-atten-
tive, since it requires no “act of will” and no information from higher brain
areas where diﬀerent objects are categorized. Multiple adaptive motion sys-
tems could act in parallel for diﬀerent directions of motion, in diﬀerent parts
of the visual ﬁeld, and on diﬀerent spatial scales. From the perspective of ef-
ﬁciency, higher perceptual and attentive mechanisms can be envisaged best
to operate on top of a representation level where object-unrelated activity
is reduced, as provided by the adaptive motion system. Although at this
point it is diﬃcult to pin down the precise mechanisms of contextual eﬀects
on neuronal responses in the visual system, it seems clear that modulation
related to object segmentation occurs as early as in V1, at least in primates;
see Lamme et al. (1998) and references therein.

A critical experimental test of a control loop such as the one analyzed
here is to look for changes in spatiotemporal RF structure on a timescale of,
say, 100 ms in response to moving, especially large-ﬁeld, stimuli. It would be
interesting to study reverse correlations in the speed or temporal-frequency
domain, analogous to work that has uncovered dynamic orientation tuning
in the monkey (Ringach et al., 1997).

More detailed modeling is required to compare the oscillations and syn-
chronization that arise in the loop model under certain conditions with re-
cent data on persistent oscillations in area 17 that are preferentially evoked
by moving stimuli (Bringuier et al., 1997; Castelo-Branco et al., 1998). In
the loop model, oscillations may arise from visual stimulation at geniculo-
cortical synapses, showing up as periodic excitatory synaptic potentials in
cortical neurons. Because of the slow potentials that modulate the GRC
states we would expect such oscillations to be at the lower end of the ob-
served frequency spectrum (below, say, 30 Hz); cf. Fig. 7. Clearly, since such
periodic inputs are not restricted to layer 4 (Bringuier et al., 1997), intra-
cortical connections have also a role to play, certainly in the propagation of
the periodic activity.

As expounded above, the loop model was not designed to ﬁt any partic-
ular set of experimental data, and at this stage it does not explain convinc-
ingly cortical oscillations. Whatever the details of a control loop, however, a

22

slow modulation of GRC membrane potentials controlled by comparatively
fast responses of cortical neurons is likely to produce oscillations under cer-
tain conditions. Our argument thus does add a new dimension to the search
for the origin of rhythmic and synchronous activity in the low-frequency
range.

Great care must be taken when extrapolating from cats to primates. No
lagged relay cells have been described in the primate LGN so far. On the
other hand, a recent study (Valois & Cottaris, 1998) does suggest a set of
geniculate inputs to directionally selective simple cells in macaque striate
cortex that is essentially analogous to the lagged-nonlagged set envisaged
for cat simple cells.
If indeed primates employ a similar system at the
lowest level of motion analysis, the corticogeniculate loop would implement
at this level the classical Gestalt principle of “common fate”, which recog-
nizes common motion as a powerful cue for object segmentation in humans
(Wertheimer, 1958; Julesz, 1971). Furthermore, we would obtain a new ra-
tionale to the nature of the input to neurons in primate area V2 that extract
the shape of objects from coherent motion on a background (Peterhans &
Baumann, 1994; Peterhans, 1997). That is to say, V1 detects an object
through common motion and V2 then analyzes its shape.

An important side eﬀect of the adaptation mechanism is that it can ac-
count for visual stabilization during ﬁxational eye movements. These erratic
eye movements cause retinal slips providing motion signals that are direc-
tionally unbiased on the timescale of the control loop (∼ 100 ms). Since
unbiased motion does not lead to adaptation to any particular velocity, none
of the moving features is highlighted. Now, if the brain relies on the activity
of adaptively speed-tuned neurons to infer motion in the outside world, no
such motion will be inferred from ﬁxational eye movements. Stabilization
of the visual world is thus achieved because successive motion signals cancel
out in the control loop.

Interestingly, this stabilization mechanism explains the recently reported
‘jitter after-eﬀect’ (Murakami & Cavanagh, 1998). An observer is ﬁrst ex-
posed to dynamic random noise for 30 s, and then ﬁxates a larger area of
static random noise. The perception is a coherent jitter of the static noise
that follows ﬁxational eye movements, speciﬁcally, in the region that has not
been exposed to the prior random motion. The explanation in terms of the
present model relies on the fact that responses of velocity-selective neurons
are reduced after stimulation for 30 s [also called ‘adaptation’, but unrelated
to the adaptation of speed preferences proposed here; see Hammond et al.
(1988)]. As can be seen from eqn. (13), for reduced cortical responses Ri,
R>
to each of the sweeps induced by eye movements, the amplitudes
Ai of the corticogeniculate potentials [cf. eqn. (6)] become larger2. The ef-
2More precisely, eqn. (13) tells us that the amplitudes Ai → 0 as the cortical responses
grow to their maximum or decrease to zero. Hence, maximal amplitudes Ai are produced

fect is similar to an increased allover strength γ of cortical feedback. So it
may be that each brief period of eye-induced motion that normally averages
out in adaptation now gives rise to ﬂuctuations of adaptation of suﬃcient
amplitude to evoke enhanced responses outside the region of reduced re-
sponsiveness. Thus the same mechanism that ensures stabilization during
normal ﬁxation will now signal jitter motion.

The results presented here oﬀer new explanations for data from diverse
research. They also suggest new experimental paradigms to test their im-
plications. In case of conﬁrmation, a re-interpretation of a large amount of
data on motion processing might be needed.

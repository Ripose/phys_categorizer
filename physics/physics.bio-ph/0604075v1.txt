Traﬃc of interacting ribosomes: eﬀects of single-machine mechano-chemistry on
protein synthesis

Many ribosomes simultaneously move on the same messenger RNA (mRNA), each synthesizing
a protein. Earlier models of ribosome traﬃc represent each ribosome by a “self-propelled particle”
and capture the dynamics by an extension of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process.
In contrast, here we develope a “uniﬁed” theoretical model that not only incorporates the mutual
exclusions of the interacting ribosomes, but also describes explicitly the mechano-chemistry of each
of these individual cyclic machines during protein synthesis. Using a combination of analytical and
numerical techniques of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we analyze this model and illustrate
its power by making experimentally testable predictions on the rate of protein synthesis and the
density proﬁle of the ribosomes on some mRNAs in E-Coli.

Translation, the process of synthesis of proteins by de-
coding genetic information stored in the mRNA, is car-
ried out by ribosomes, which are among the largest and
most complex macromolecular machines within the cell
[1]. Fundamental understanding of the interplay of the
biochemical reactions and mechanical movements of ribo-
somes will not only provide deep insight into the mecha-
nisms of regulation and control of protein synthesis, but
also ﬁnd biomedical applications as ribosome is the target
of many antibiotics [2].

Most often many ribosomes move simultaneously move
on the same mRNA strand while each synthesises a pro-
tein. The inter-ribosome interactions cannot be ignored
except at extremely low densities.
In all the earlier
models of collective traﬃc-like movements of ribosomes
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the entire ribosome is modelled as
a single “self-propelled particle” ignoring its molecular
composition and architecture. Moreover, in these mod-
els the inter-ribosome interactions are captured through
hard-core mutual exclusion and the dynamics of the sys-
tem is formulated in terms of rules that are essentially
straightforward extensions of the totally asymmetric sim-
ple exclusion process (TASEP) [10].

In reality, the mechanical movement of each ribosome
is coupled to its biochemical cycle. The earlier TASEP-
like models successfully explain some of the collective
propeties of ribosome traﬃc but fail to account for those
aspects of spatio-temporal organization that depend on
detailed mechano-chemical cycle of each ribosome.
In
this letter we develope a “uniﬁed” model that not only in-
corporates the hard-core mutual exclusion of the interact-
ing ribosomes, but also captures explicitly the essential
steps in the biochemical cycle of each ribosome, including
GTP (guanine triphosphate) hydrolysis, and couples it to
its mechanical movement during protein synthesis. Con-
sequently, in the low-density limit, our model accounts

for the protein synthesis by a single isolated ribosome
while at higher densities the same model predicts not
only the rate of protein synthesis but also the collective
density proﬁle of the ribosomes on the mRNA strand.

We represent the mRNA chain, consisting of L codons,
by a one-dimensional lattice of length L+ℓ−1 where each
of the ﬁrst L sites from the left represents a single codon
(i.e., a triplet of nucleotides). We label the sites of the
lattice by the integer i; the sites i = 1 and i = L represent
the start codon and the stop codon, respectively.

The small sub-unit of the ribosome, which is known
to bind with the mRNA, is represented by an extended
particle of length ℓ (in the units of the size of a codon),
as shown in ﬁg.1(a) (ℓ = 12 for all results reported here).
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], Thus, the small subunit of each ribosome
covers ℓ codons at a time (see ﬁg.1(b)). According to
our convention, the position of such a ribosome on the
mRNA strand will be given by the position of the lattice
site covered by the left edge of its smaller subunit. Each
ribosome moves forward by only one site in each step as it
must translate successive codons one by one. The mutual
interactions of the ribosomes translocating on the same
mRNA is taken into account by imposing the constraint
of mutual exclusion.

The process of translation itself can be divided into
three main stages: (a) initiation, (b) elongation, and (c)
termination. Since our model is not intended to describe
initiation and termination in detail, we represent initia-
tion and termination by the two parameters α and β, re-
spectively (see ﬁg.1(b)). If the ﬁrst ℓ sites on the mRNA
are vacant, this group of sites is allowed to be covered by
a ribosome, from the pool of unbound ribosomes, with
probability α in the time interval ∆t (in all our numeri-
cal calculations we take ∆t = 0.001 s). Similarly, if the
rightmost ℓ sites of the mRNA lattice are covered by a
ribosome, i.e., the ribosome is bound to the L-th codon,
the ribosome gets detached from the mRNA with prob-
ability β in the time interval ∆t. Moreover, since α is
the probability of attachment in time ∆t, the probability
of attachment per unit time (which we call ωα) is the

mRNA is represented by a one-dimensional lattice each site

ously ℓ codons (ℓ = 2 in this ﬁgure). The parameters α and
β capture the eﬀective rates of initiation and termination of
translation. (c) The biochemical cycle of a single ribosome

solution of the equation α = 1 − e−ωα×∆t.

To our knowledge, all the earlier models of ribosome
traﬃc on mRNA [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], describe elongation
also by a single parameter, namely, the rate q of hopping
of a ribosome from one codon to the next. In contrast,
we model the chemo-mechanics of elongation in detail.
We ﬁrst identify seven distinct states of the ribosome in
each such cycle as shown schematically in ﬁg.1(c). How-

2

ever, in setting up the rate equations below, we treat the
entire transition 5 → 6 → 7 → 1 as, eﬀectively, a single
step transition from 5 to 1, with rate constant ωh2. Thus,
throughout this paper we work with a simpliﬁed model
where each biochemical cycle during the elongation pro-
cess consists of ﬁve distinct states.

The modelling strategy adopted here for incorporat-
ing biochemical cycle of ribosomes is similar to that fol-
lowed in the recent work [11] on single-headed kinesin mo-
tors KIF1A. However, the implementation of the strat-
egy is more diﬃcult here not only because of the higher
complexity of composition, architecture and mechano-
chemical processes of the ribosomal machinery and but
also because of the heterogeneity of the mRNA track [12].
Let Pµ(i) be the probability of ﬁnding a ribosome at
5
µ=1 Pµ(i),
site i, in the chemical state µ. Then, P (i) =
is the probability of ﬁnding a ribosome at site i, irre-
spective of its chemical state. Moreover, if a site is not
covered by any part of any ribosome, we’ll say that the
site is occupied by a “hole”. Furthermore, by the symbol
Q(i|j) we denote the conditional probability that, given
a ribosome at site i, there is a hole at the site j. The
master equations for the probabilities Pµ(i) are given by

Because of the ﬁnite length of the codon sequence be-

ary conditions (PBC). However, we begin with a calcu-

imposing PBC as the results for this artiﬁcial situation
are required for a derivation of the dynamical phase dia-
gram of the system under OBC. Under PBC, Pµ(i) for all
i are governed by the equations (1)-(5). Moreover, under
the PBC, only four of the ﬁve equations (1)-(5) are inde-
5
pendent because P (i) =
µ=1 Pµ(i) = N/L = ρ where
ρ, the number density of the ribosomes, is a constant in-
dependent of time; therefore, we do not need to consider
equation (1) for P1(i) explicitly. In the steady state, all
time derivatives vanish and because of the translational
invariance of this state under PBC, the index i can be
dropped. It is straightforward to show [13] that, for PBC,

.

Therefore, under the PBC, equations (2-5) can be solved,
using (8), to obtain

a single ribosome is ℓJ. This mean-ﬁeld estimate is a
reasonably good approximation to the data obtained by
direct computer simulations [13].

Motivated by the recent measurements [14, 15] of the
number of bound ribosomes on the mRNA, we have com-
puted the detailed concentration proﬁles of the ribosomes

and also drawn the phase diagrams in the spirit of the
similar plots of non-equilibrium dynamical phases of to-
tally asymmetric simple exclusion process [10].

The probabilities α and β of initiation and termination
are incorporated into the model by connecting the ends
of the mRNA strand to two hypothetical reseroirs with
appropriate denities ρ− and ρ+, respectively [5]. The
extremum principle [10, 16] then relates the ﬂux j in the
open system to the ﬂux J(ρ) for a closed periodic system
with the same dynamics:

j =

(cid:26)

max J(ρ) if ρ− > ρ > ρ+
min J(ρ) if ρ− < ρ < ρ+

For systems with a single maximum in the function J(ρ),
at ρ = ρ∗, such as equation (11), the maximal current
phase sets in when ρ− > ρ∗ > ρ+. By diﬀerentiating
equation (11), we ﬁnd [13]

It can also be shown that [13]

ρ− =

Pωh − α(1 + Ωh2)(1 − ℓ)

(14)

(15)

where Pωh is the probability of hydrolysis in the time ∆t,
and that ρ+ = 0. Similarly, the probability of attachment
of a aa − tRN A in time ∆t is denoted by Pωa . Thus, the
phase boundaries between the various phases have been
obtained by solving the equation

ρ−(α, ωa, ωh1, ωh2) = ρ∗(α, ωa, ωh1, ωh2)

(16)

numerically, and two typical phase diagrams have been
plotted in ﬁgs.2(a) and (b) assuming [17, 18] ωh1 = ωh2 =
ωh.

We focus on genes of Escherichia coli K-12 strain
MG1655 [19]. We directly simulate the system by assum-
ing that the site dependent transition rate ωa is propor-
tional to the percentage availability of the corresponding
aa-tRNA for that codon, in the E Coli cell [20, 21]. In
ﬁgure (3), we see how the current increases as ωh (in
(a)) and α (in (b)) increases and gradually saturates;
the saturation value of the current is numerically equal
to the maximum current obtained in the corresponding
case with PBC [13]. Simultaneously, the average density
of the ribosomes decreases in (a) (and increases in (b))
as the parameter ωh in (a) (and α in (b)) increases, and
gradually satuarates. These observations are consistent
with the scenario of phase transition from the low density
phase to the maximal current phase, as predicted by the
extremal current hypothesis. Moreover, the lower ﬂux
observed for real genes, as compared to that for homo-
geneous mRNA, is caused by the codon speciﬁcity of the
available tRNA molecules.

In this letter we have developed a “uniﬁed” theoreti-
cal model for protein synthesis by mutually interacting
ribosomes following the master equation approach of non-
equilibrium statistical mechanics. We have computed (i)
the rate of protein synthesis in real time and (ii) density
proﬁle of the ribosomes on a given mRNA, and stud-
ied their dependences on the rates of various mechano-
chemical processes in each ribosome. We have illustrated
the use of our model by applying these to two genes of E-
Coli and making theoretical predictions which, we hope,
will motivate new quantitative measurements.

Thermodynamic and Kinetic Analysis of Sensitivity

Ampliﬁcation in Biological Signal Transduction

Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Washington

February 21, 2014

Based on a thermodynamic analysis of the kinetic model for the protein

phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, we study the ATP (or GTP) en-

ergy utilization of this ubiquitous biological signal transduction process. It

was shown that the free energy from hydrolysis inside cells, ∆G (phosphory-

lation potential), controls the ampliﬁcation and sensitivity of the switch-like

cellular module; the response coeﬃcient of the sensitivity ampliﬁcation ap-

proaches the optimal 1 and the Hill coeﬃceint increases with increasing ∆G.

Futhermore, we show the high ampliﬁcation in zero-order ultrasensitivity is

mechanistically related to the proofreading kinetics for protein biosynthesis.

Both utilize multiple kinetic cycles in time to gain temporal cooperativity,

in contrast to allosteric cooperativity that utilizes multiple subunits in a

protein.

Introduction

Biological signal transduction processes are increasingly being understood in quantitative and mod-

ular terms [12, 6]. One of the most commonly studied modules of cellular “circuitry” is the

phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC) [14] which has been shown to exhibit sensitiv-

ity ampliﬁcation for the appropriate stimuli expressed through activating a kinase or inhibiting a

phosphatase [20, 3, 13]. Both experimental measurement [19, 11, 2] and theoretical modeling have

shown that the covalent modiﬁcation gives rise to a switch-like behavior.

Sensitivity ampliﬁcation requires energy consumption [20, 19, 4]. Since the PdPC involves the

transfer of high-energy phosphate group, it is natural to ask how the cellular phosphoenergetics

1

play a role in the signal transduction processes. Recently, we [16] have proposed a novel mechanism

for improved Rab 5 GTPase function as cellular timer [1] by utilizing the energy derived from GTP

hydrolysis. It is shown that an energy expenditure is necessary for a GTPase timer to be accurate

and robust.

Phosphoenergetics and ATP hydrolysis are also involved in PdPC. While it is known that energy

expenditure is required to maintain levels of phosphorylation in excess of an equilibrium [20, 4],

it is still not yet clear how cellular energetics relates to this type of signal transduction process.

One approach to address this question is introducing a rigorous thermodynamic analysis into the

kinetic models of PdPC [3, 11]. The simplest kinetic scheme for PdPC is shown in (1), which is

based on a model proposed by Stadtman and Chock (1977) and by Goldbeter and Koshland (1981).

The essential diﬀerence between our (1) and the earlier models is the nonzero q1 and q2, i.e., the

reversibility of the separate and distinct phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes.

In order to carry out a cogent thermodynamic analysis for the kinetic model of PdPC, the

reversibility of the biochemical reactions involved, speciﬁcally the phosphorylation catalyzed by

kinase and dephosphorylation catalyzed by phosphatase, must be enforced. While this was known

to be an important issue [5], most current models neglect the slow reverse steps.

2 Basic Biochemical Equilibrium and Energetics

We consider a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC) catalyzed by kinase E1 and phos-
phatase E2 respectively. The phosphorylation covalently modiﬁes the protein W to become W ∗:

W + E1

It is important to note that the reaction (1) is not the reverse reaction of (2). In fact, recognizing
that the hydrolysis reaction ATP ⇋ ADP+Pi explicitly, we have

Following the elegant mathematical treatment given in [3], we have the steady-state fraction of

These three parameters are in the original model [3] which, by assuming irreversible reactions with

activity. Hence it characterizes the magnitude of the stimuli for the PdPC. 1/K1 and 1/K2 are the

ratios of substrate concentrations to the Michaelis-Menten constants of kinase and phosphatase,

respectively. A small K (

is plotted in Fig. 1 using K1 = K2 = 0.01, i.e., both enzymes are highly saturated thus the
rates are weakly dependent on the respective substrate concentrations [3], and µ = 10−3, i.e., the

dephosphorylation reaction is highly irreversible [5]. It is seen that the quality of the ampliﬁer is
directly related to the phosphorylation potential. In fact, when γ = 1, i.e., ATP ⇋ ADP+Pi are

In this case, the ampliﬁcation is completely abolished. Biological

ampliﬁcation needs energy, just like a home stereo.

The switch-like behavior in Fig. 1 can be understood semi-quantitatively as follows (Fig. 2).

V1 = k1E1T . Therefore the overall rate of the reaction is

The response coeﬃcient, Rv, which characterizes the steepness of the transition in covalent
modiﬁcation, has been deﬁned as the ratio of the σ when W ∗ = 90% to the σ when W ∗ = 10%

[3]. For a simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics this value is 81. A value of 1 means the transition is
inﬁnitely steep. With the ﬁnite γ and µ, in theory, because W ∗ never exceeds 0.9 for a range of µ
and γ (Fig. 1), Rv needs to be redeﬁned as the ratio of σ when W ∗ = 0.9W ∗(

of ∆G, the steepness Rv reaches its minimal, platuea value given in [3].

4 Temporal Cooperativity

Allosteric change in and covalent modiﬁcation of proteins are two most basic phenomena in cellu-

lar signaling processes [13]. While the equilibrium thermodynamic principle of the former is well

understood [22], relatively little attention has been given to the steady-state thermodynamics [7]

of the latter. The analysis developed in this paper indicates that the cooperativity in the cyclic

reaction is temporal, with energy “stored” in time rather than in space as for the allosteric coop-

erativity. This concept, termed energy relay, was ﬁrst proposed by J.J. Hopﬁeld for understanding

the molecular mechanism of kinetic proofreading in protein synthesis [9, 10]. Here we extend this

concept by carrying out a quantitative comparison between the steady-state system given in Eq. 1

and the allosteric cooperativity.

High-order versus zero-order reactions

One of the most fundamental diﬀerence between allosteric cooperativity and zero-order ultra-

sensitivity is the order of the reactions. Allosteric cooperativity is based on the high-order reaction

and the corresponding fraction of protein with ligand

P + nL

K n
⇋ P Ln

Y =

[P Ln]
[P ] + [P Ln]

=

(KL)n
1 + (KL)n .

Eq. 18 indicates that the steepness of the curve Y versus ln(K[L]) increases with n. On the other

hand, ultrasensitivity is based on both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions being

enzyme limited; hence both have a very weak dependence on the respective substrate concentrations
[W ] and [W ∗]. In the steady-state

kph[W ]ν = kdp[W

∗

]ν

where kph and kdp are the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and ν is near zero. The

corresponding fraction of protein in the activated state

Z =

[W ∗]
[W ] + [W ∗]

=

k1/ν
ph
ph + k1/ν
k1/ν

dp

.

Eq. 19 indicates that the steepness of the curve Z versus ln(kph/kdp) increases with 1/ν. Therefore,

the optimal situation is a zero-order reaction with ν = 0.

Temporal cooperativity in zero-order reaction cycle

6

(18)

(19)

The cooperativity achieved by ultrasensitivity, therefore, can be stated as follows. It takes, on
average, nv = 1/ν PdPCs in order to transform one W to W ∗. There is a temporal cooperativity
on the scale of nv cycles. Therefore, nv in time is analogous to the number of subunits in allosteric
cooperativity. Most importantly, transforming one W to one W ∗ through multiple “futile” cycles

is precisely the mechanism proposed by Hopﬁeld for kinetics proofreading of protein biosynthesis
in which nv ≈
the need to maintain high accuracy and sensitivity or improved memory of a steady-state “living”

2 [9, 10]. Of course, the ATP hydrolysis is not futile, rather the energy supplies

system away from true thermodynamic equilibrium.

The above statement can be further quantiﬁed. Let’s consider a system with only a single E1
and a single E2 molecule, but n W molecules. The complete kinetics of W ∗ formation can be
represented by a chain kinetic scheme shown in Fig. 4 [18], which is more detailed than what is

shown in (1). Each time a cycle is completed, one ATP molecule is hydrolyzed. The cooperativity

of the kinetics in Fig. 4 is characterized by

αn−i
βi+1 .

−
(i + 1)β1

=

i + 1 + nK2

.

−

(20)

For n completely independent W molecules undergoing W ⇋ W ∗ transition, Eq. 20 is expected

to be unity. However the n W molecules in Fig 4 are not independent since they are linked by the

enzymatic reactions. For small K1 and K2, there is a cooperative phosphorylation when i > n/2

and there is a cooperative dephosphorylation when i < n/2.

Fig 5 shows that the steepness of the response curve for the model in Fig. 4. The detailed

model gives the same nv = 12.5 for K1 = K2 = 0.01. The signiﬁcance of this chain model, however,

is that it reveals the origin of the cooperativity [8]. Furthermore, according to the theory of linear

cooperativity [17, 8], the steepness of the curves in Fig. 1 is directly related to the microscopic
ﬂuctuation in the the number of W ∗.

Fig. 6 shows a numerical example of the reaction kinetics of the model given in Fig. 4. The
(∆W ∗)2

large ﬂuctuations in the number of W ∗ molecules is directly related to the nv. In fact,
= √nnv is expected to be 112. More cooperative system has larger ﬂuctuations.

5 Discussion

The rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the model for phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle

(PdPC) originally proposed in [20, 3] indicates that a sustained intracellular phosphorylation po-

tential is essential in the functioning of the signal transduction process. This result suggests that

7

the ubiquitous phosphorylation in biological signaling processes, in addition to the covalent chem-

ical modiﬁcation which leads to structural recognition, also utilizes biochemical energy from the

high-energy phosphate in order to carry out its function with high accuracy, robustness, and sensi-

tivity [9, 16]. The analysis also reveals a shared mechanism between the ultrasensitivity and kinetic

proofreading in a large class of cellular processes involving GTPases [1]. Both use cycle kinetics [7]

to improve the power of biological selectivity.

Our quantitative analysis also provided a clear mechanistic origin for the high cooperativity in

the zero-order ultrasensitivity. A chain kinetic model indicates that the cooperativity is achieved

through temporal cooperativity. This mechanism is parallel in mathematical form to, but funda-

mentally diﬀerent in biochemical nature from, the allosteric cooperativity of multi-subunits protein

systems [22]. Both temporal and allosteric cooperativities have a deep connection to the molecu-

lar ﬂuctuations [18], an insight largely unexplored in the studies of biological signal transduction

processes.

In order to compare our result with that of Goldbeter and Koshland, we have used the value

K1 = K2 = 0.01 in this study. These values are extreme cases and many PdPCs studied in lab-
oratory experiments show a much less cooperativity. With Km ≈
of

1µM for the kinases in the MAPK pathway [11], the realistic value will be

1µM and concentrations

phosphatase concentration is even lower,

1nM. Note that from Eq. 17 high cooperativity requires

both K’s for the kinase and the phosphatase to be small. The current model analysis also suggests

that the source of phosphate in a PdPC, while chemically equivalent, could be important. A phos-

phate from ATP hydrolysis can be energetically diﬀerent from a phosphate from GTP hydrolysis.

Number of W*

Figure 6: Upper pannel shows a numerical simulation of the reaction given in Fig. 4, with n = 1000,
E1T = E2T = 1, K1 = K2 = 0.01, k1 = k2 = 100. Since σ = 1, the steady-state [W ∗] = 500. The
large ﬂuctuations in the number of W ∗ molecules is directly related to the nv:
=
√nnv. Lower pannel shows the probability distributions for the number of W ∗. Solid ﬂat line:
σ = 1.00, Dashed lines: diﬀerent distributions for σ = 0.97 and 1.03 respectively. We see a sharp
response to σ being less and greater than 1. In comparison, the central peak with dotted line is for
non-cooperative system with 1000 independent molecules and σ = 1. More cooperative system has
larger ﬂuctuations.

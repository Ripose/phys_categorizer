Abstract

We present a model of cooperativity between transmembrane receptors. Two

responses to ligand binding, receptor signalling and the enhancement of clus-

tering, or oligomerization, are uniﬁed in the same framework. The model

is based on a conformation-dependent interaction between neighboring re-

ceptors.

In order to decrease the total energy of the system, neighboring

receptors tend to have a same conformational state, while receptors with the

same conformational state tend to cluster together. In the presence of noise,

there is a probability distribution of various conﬁgurations of the system.

This situation is treated using analytical and numerical methods of statis-

tical mechanics. Signalling sensitivity is enhanced by an appropriate choice

of coupling-noise-ratio. There is a range of the threshold value of receptor

conformational change for which clustering is enhanced by ligand binding.

INTRODUCTION

On the surface of a cell, there are many transmembrane receptors.

In the presence

of certain extracellular ligands which bind to the receptors, receptor signalling causes a

cascade of responses in the cell. An additional ubiquitous phenomenon is that ligand binding

enhances clustering, or oligomerization, of the receptors. The purpose of this paper is to

present a universal framework which combines these two aspects, by constructing a general

model using statistical mechanics.

Investigations of oligomerization are widely reported for a variety of receptors. Among

others, just to give a few examples (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 1994; Heldin, 1995; Lemmon

et al., 1997; Germain, 1997; Reich et al., 1997 Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998; Giancotti and

Ruoslahti 1999; Gilboa et al., 2000; Shultz et al., 2000): integins, which attach cells to the

extracellular matrix, tyrosine kinase (TRK) receptors, cytoskine receptors, growth factor re-

ceptors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, including death receptors, antigen receptors

such as T-cell receptors, bone morphogenetic protein receptor, G-protein-coupled receptors,

etc.

Therefore, the response of receptors to ligand binding often comprises two processes.

One is the signalling through conformational changes, which is very sensitive. Another is

the clustering. In the case of bacterial chemotaxis, thousands of receptors cluster together at

a pole of the cell, hinting that the clustered nature of the receptor may be related to the sen-

sitivity of signalling (Parkinson and Blair, 1993; Bray et al., 1998). Recently a cooperative

model was constructed for the signalling of an a priori cluster of receptors (Shi and Duke,

1998). This model provides a good explanation for the chemotactic signalling sensitivity, and

gives results in good agreement with a recent experiment (Jasuja et al., 1999). Numerical

simulation (Duke and Bray, 1999) based on this model (Shi and Duke, 1998) demonstrated

that sensitivity could be maintained over a wide range of ambient concentration. Investiga-

tions on the adaptation process led to a so-called adaptive Ising model which preserves the

signalling sensitivity by negative feedback (Shi, 2000). On the other hand, Guo and Levine

2

studied the clustering of receptors as a consequence of receptor-receptor interaction, based

on the assumption that the interaction between neighbors depends on whether the receptors

are liganded (Guo and Levine, 1999), while the signalling problem was not considered. We

think that it is more likely that the interaction depends on the activities, i.e. the confor-

mational states of the receptors. In addition to the reasons given previously (Shi and Duke,

1998; Shi 2000), this is also supported by the strong experimental evidence that oligomer-

ization is stabilized by receptor-receptor interaction promoted by conformational changes

of the receptors (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 1994; Heldin, 1995; Lemmon et al., 1997; Ger-

main, 1997; Gilboa et al., 2000; Shultz et al., 2000). By extending our previous model to

the case in which receptors diﬀuse on the membrane, we propose that signalling sensitivity

and oligomerization are two consequences of the same mechanism based on conformation-

dependent receptor-receptor interaction. As a consequence, the conformational state of a

receptor is inﬂuenced not only by the ligand bound to itself, but also by ligands bound to

other receptors in its immediate vicinity.

THE MODEL

Consider a collection of receptors on a lattice (see Fig. 1 for two conﬁgurations). Let

the coordinate number be ν, which is 6 for a honeycomb lattice and is 4 for a square lattice.

Suppose that the receptors can move around on the lattice. Therefore at an instant, a

receptor may have less than ν nearest-neighboring receptors. The conformational state of

the receptor at lattice point i is represented as Vi, the value of which is either V 0 or V 1. Vi

is decided by whether this receptor is liganded or not, as well as the conformational states of

its nearest-neighboring receptors. We use Hi to represent whether there is a ligand binding,

that is, Hi = H if the receptor is ligand bound, otherwise Hi = 0. Thus given the ligand

concentration [L], each Hi is randomly distributed between H, with probability c, and 0,

with probability 1 − c, i.e. the probability distribution is

p(Hi) = cδ(Hi − H) + (1 − c)δ(Hi),

(1)

3

where c is the occupancy, i.e. the fraction of liganded receptors. c = [L]/([L] + Kd), where

Kd is the dissociation constant. We associate each site i with a variable ni, which is 1 if

there is a receptor on this site, and is 0 otherwise. In reality, of course Vi and Hi are only

deﬁned when there is a receptor on site i. But because the presence or not of a receptor at

site i has been decided by ni, for the convenience of treatment, equivalently we may attach

V i and Hi to each site i, no matter whether there is a receptor on site i. Since the receptors

are allowed to diﬀuse, {ni} depend on time, with the constraint that the sum of ni, i.e. the

total number of receptors, is conserved.

Therefore, in the noiseless case, i.e. zero temperature, we have

Vi = ψ(X

j

TijnjVj + Hi − Ui), with ψ(x) =

V 1 if x > 0

V 0 if x ≤ 0

,




(2)

where the summation is over the nearest neighbors, Ui ≥ 0 is a threshold value, Tij describes

the coupling between nearest neighbors. Since ligand binding causes the conformational state

to change from V 0 to V 1, we set V 0 < V 1 and H > 0. Hence, with Tij = Tji and Tii = 0,

the dynamics is determined by the following Hamiltonian under the constraint that the sum

of ni is conserved,

H = −t X

<ij>

ninjViVj − X

(3)

where hiji represents pairs of nearest neighbors, Tij and Ui have been set to be constants.

The kinetic energy has been neglected.

For convenience, we may transform to a “spin” language, with the deﬁnition Si = 2(Vi −

V 0)/(V 1 −V 0) −1, hence it is 1 if Vi = V 1, and is −1 if Vi = V 0. Then in order to simply the

mathematics without loss of the essence of physics, suppose V 1 = −V 0, which is also quite

reasonable from the symmetric point of view. Therefore we obtain the following simpliﬁed

Hamiltonian

H = −J X

ninjSiSj − X

with J = t(V 1 − V 0)2/4, Bi = (Hi − U)(V 1 − V 0)/2, which is thus B1 = (H − U)(V 1 − V 0)/2

with probability c and is B2 = −U(V 1 − V 0)/2 with probability 1 − c, i.e

p(Bi) = cδ(Bi − B1) + (1 − c)δ(Bi − B2).

SIGNALLING SENSITIVITY

The conformational changes of the receptors leads to the signalling, which can be deﬁned

as the change of Pi niVi, averaging over the thermodynamic ensemble. It can be calculated
ii is its ensemble
analytically in an approximate mean ﬁeld theory. Deﬁne niSi as S ′

i, m = hS ′

average with the Hamiltonian given by (4), and (5). Let m0 is the value of hS ′

ii with c = 0,

i.e. no ligand binding in the system. Then the signal, i.e the activity change, is given by

(m − m0)(V 1 − V 0)/2. One may obtain

where

Thus

m = cF (m, B1) + (1 − c)F (m, B2),

F (m, B) =

eβνJ m+βB − e−(βνJ m+βB)

eβνJ m+βB + e−(βνJ m+βB) + 1

.

m0 = F (m0, B2).

β is the measure of the noise; in the simplest interpretation, the noise is purely thermal,

β = 1/kBT , where T is the temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant.

The sensitivity may be quantitatively measured by S = 1

which shows that the sensitivity can be very large, if the value of βνJ is appropriate.

CLUSTERING

The conformation-dependent interaction is also responsible for clustering. The ﬁrst term

of the Hamiltonian in (4) implies that, in order to minimize the Hamiltonian, the receptors

tend to aggregate together to maximize the number of nonzero ninj for neighboring hiji with

Si = Sj. Therefore receptors with the same conformational state tends to cluster. At a non-

zero temperature,they cannot all cluster together, however, because clustering diminishes

entropy. As an illustration of the situation, two snapshots of the conﬁguration obtained in

Monte Carlo simulations are shown in Fig. 1.

The second term in Eq. (4) determines how ligand binding aﬀects the clustering situation.

It can be seen that the value of the threshold, U, which determines the bias of the distribution

of the receptor state {Si} in the absence of ligand binding, also determines whether ligand

binding enhances or suppresses the clustering. There are two extreme cases, as in the

following.

Case (I): U = H. A sole ligand binding of a receptor is enough to change its conforma-

tional state. Then B1 = 0, B2 = −H(V 1 − V 0)/2.

Case (II): U = 0. In the absence of ligand binding, there is no bias in the state distribu-

tion. Then B1 = H(V 1 − V 0)/2, B2 = 0.

These two cases can map to each other with the transformation H → −H and c → 1 − c.

In case (I), since B2 < 0, in the absence of ligand, all Si tend to be close to −1. Ligand

binding causes more Si to be 1. Because receptors with the same value of Si tend to

cluster, those with diﬀerent Si tend to be disconnected, the conclusion is that ligand binding

suppresses clustering.

In case (II), the situation is on the converse. In the absence of ligand binding, there is

no biasing ﬁeld, so there are equal probabilities for Si to be 1 and −1, consequently the

clustering is minimized. When there is ligand binding, the clustering is enhanced.

For other values of the threshold, i.e. U 6= 0 and U 6= H, we have the following general

picture. Without ligand binding, there is a uniform ﬁeld B2 at every site. In the presence

6

of ligand binding, there is a random ﬁeld as given by (5). With a very rough mean ﬁeld

estimation, one may see that whether the clustering is enhanced depends on whether (1 −

c)B2 + cB1 has larger absolute value than |B2|. Thus only if H > 2U/c, is the clustering

enhanced by ligand binding. Case (II) belongs to this range.

The clustering of receptors can be studied quantitatively by deﬁning a clustering corre-

lation function as

C(r) =

hnini+ri − hni2

hni2

,

(10)

where the average is over diﬀerent sites i and diﬀerent directions of r ﬁrst, and then over the

thermodynamic ensemble, i.e. diﬀerent possible conﬁgurations at the same temperature. hni

is the density of receptors on the lattice. If there is no clustering correlation, hnini+ri=hni2,

thus C(r) = 0. This deﬁnition measures the deviation from the non-correlating case and

allows comparison of situations for diﬀerent receptor densities.

SIMULATION RESULTS

To investigate the extent of clustering and to calculate the signalling, we have done

Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm. We have speciﬁcally investigated

Case (II), from which one may obtain the results for case (I) simply by changing c to 1 − c.

The results show that signiﬁcant correlations exist for small value of r. Beyond certain value

of r, the correlation function has low values. We studied correlation functions for diﬀerent

concentrations c of ligand binding, with a same receptor density hni (Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)).

From the correlation function for small values of r, it is clear that the larger the ligand

binding fraction c, the larger the correlation. This conﬁrms the above analyses. Comparing

Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), it can be seen that with larger coupling, the correlation function C(r) for

small r is larger, while for large r, C(r) is closer to 0, indicating that clustering is stronger.

We also studied the correlation functions for diﬀerent values of receptor densities hni with

a same ligand binding concentration c (Fig. 2(c)). It is shown that the smaller the receptor

7

density, the larger the correlation function. This can be understood, since the larger the

density, the less freedom two receptors can approach each other.

We also calculate the signalling in the simulations. Fig. 3 gives the relation between the

signal and the ligand binding concentration, for diﬀerent values of coupling. For comparison

between diﬀerent receptor densities, the plotted activity M is the ensemble average of the

average of Si over all receptors, instead of the average over all lattice points, as deﬁned as

m above. M = mL2/N, where L is the square lattice size, N is the number of receptors.

From the plots, we see that the signal increases with the ligand binding fraction c, with the

coupling-noise-ratio βJ, and with the receptor density hni.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper, we propose a statistical mechanical model which accounts for clustering

and signalling of receptors in a same framework.

In this model, the interaction energy

between neighboring receptors depends on their conformational states, therefore through this

interaction, the conformational state of one receptor can inﬂuence those of its neighbors. On

the other hand, since the receptors are allowed to move on the membrane, the receptors with

a same conformational state tend to cluster together, in order to decrease the total energy

of the system. Therefore the clustering and signalling are uniﬁed as two consequences of the

same coupling between receptors.

According to our model, clustering exists even in absence of the ligand binding. This is

in accordance with a most recent experiments (Gilnoa et al., 2000). We have studied the

clustering based on an appropriate deﬁnition of clustering correlation function. Monte Carlo

simulations were made. To have the situation that ligand binding enhances the clustering,

a crucial parameter, namely, the threshold value U for the change of the conformational

state, which decides the state distribution in the absence of ligand binding, must be in a

certain range.

If the values of the variable characterizing the two conformational states,

e.g. the positions, are symmetric, i.e. with a same magnitude and with opposite signs, then

8

a simple possibility is that this threshold value is zero. Nevertheless, we note that it was

found experimentally that, in the absence of ligands, the receptors are hindered to cluster by

certain inhibitors, which are squeezed out when ligands bind (Jiang et al., 1999). Therefore

in such a case, it may be constrained that clustering is always enhanced by ligand binding.

On the other hand, our model gives rise to signalling sensitivity, by choosing an appro-

priate value of coupling-noise-ratio. We made both mean ﬁeld estimation and Monte Carlo

calculations of the signalling.

It is straightforward to make further extensions of this model, for example, to put in more

details of the realistic systems, including the possibility that a receptor has more than two

conformational states. The adaptation can be studied by straightforwardly generalizing the

previous approach based on a counteracting ﬁeld as a feedback from the signal to the ﬁeld

(Shi, 2000). In the present case, both signalling and the clustering are adapted through a

feedback, in a long time scale. A simple and direct test of our model is to examine whether

conformational state of a receptor can be changed by ligand binding of its neighboring

receptors.

N = 300, βJ = 0.4 (+). (iii) N = 300, βJ = 0.8 (×). (iv) N = 300, βJ = 1.6 (⊙).

In this

case, the deviation of M (c = 0) from 0 is spontaneous ‘magnetization’ due to strong coupling, but

the negative feedback on a longer time scale, as discussed in (Shi, 2000), can bring it to 0. (v)

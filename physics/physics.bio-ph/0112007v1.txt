Abstract

We introduce a probabilistic model for the RNA-polymerase sliding motion along DNA during the
promoter search. The model accounts for possible eﬀects due to sequence-dependent interactions
between the nonspeciﬁc DNA and the enzyme. We focus on T7 RNA-polymerase and exploit the
available information about its interaction at the promoter site in order to investigate the inﬂuence
of bacteriophage T7 DNA sequence on the dynamics of the sliding process. Hydrogen bonds in the
major groove are used as the main sequence-dependent interaction between the RNA-polymerase
and the DNA. The resulting dynamical properties and the possibility of an experimental validation
are discussed in details. We show that, while at large times the process reaches a pure diﬀusive
regime, it initially displays a sub-diﬀusive behavior. The crossover from anomalous to normal
diﬀusion may occur at times large enough to be of biological interest.

Introduction

In particular,

The way by which the diﬀerent proteins can
ﬁnd and recognize their target site along a long
DNA chain represents still now a puzzling prob-
lem in many cases. These mechanisms can im-
ply jumping or inter-segment transfer and non-
speciﬁc sliding along the DNA (Travers, 1993;
von Hippel and Berg, 1989; Shimamoto, 1999;
Stanford et al., 2000).
it has
been experimentally shown that sliding along
DNA is at least one of the main mechanisms by
which RNA-polymerase (RNAP) can ﬁnd spe-
ciﬁc DNA sequences: several direct and indirect
evidences have been obtained by diﬀerent kind
of experiments (Park et al., 1982a,b; Singer and
Wu, 1987; Ricchetti et al., 1988; Kabata et al.,
1993; Guthold et al., 1994; Schulz et al., 1998;
Guthold et al., 1999; Shimamoto, 1999; Harada
et al., 1999). Nevertheless, a precise experi-
mental determination of the statistical law char-

acterizing the diﬀusive motion of RNAP along
DNA during the promoter search, is presently
lacking. The knowledge of the statistical proper-
ties of the RNAP dynamics is important for giv-
ing an insight into the nonspeciﬁc interactions
that guide the RNA-polymerase along the DNA.
This is a ﬁeld scarcely investigated from an
experimental point of view (Shimamoto, 1999)
although ongoing single molecule experiments
would probably shade some light on this ques-
tion (Guthold et al., 1999; Shimamoto, 1999;
Harada et al., 1999). It is believed that during
the sliding motion, the activation barrier for the
translocation of the RNAP to contiguous non-
speciﬁc positions is high enough to randomize
the polymerase motion through collisions with
the solvent molecules (Shimamoto, 1999), but
appropriately small compared to the thermal en-
ergy, in order to allow the protein to move (von
Hippel and Berg, 1989). This has induced some
authors to propose a model where RNAP freely

slides along DNA under the eﬀect of the thermal
ﬂuctuations without any sequence dependent in-
teraction, i.e. the DNA is seen as an homoge-
neous cylinder on which RNAP can diﬀuses un-
til the promoter site is reached (von Hippel and
Berg, 1989; von Hippel et al., 1996). Anyway,
since sliding represents the last stage in the pro-
moter search, a recognition mechanism must be
involved, i.e. the RNAP must be able to dis-
tinguish the promoter region from nonspeciﬁc
DNA. To this regard, the possibility that sliding
could imply sequence dependent RNAP-DNA
interactions is rather reasonable. This suggest
that DNA base sequence could inﬂuence the sta-
tistical properties of the diﬀusive RNAP motion
(von Hippel and Berg, 1989) (base sequence in-
duced dynamics along DNA was also considered
in Ref.s (Salerno, 1991, 1995)).

The aim of the present paper is to investi-
gate this idea in the context of a simple proba-
bilistic model for the RNA-polymerase sliding
along DNA which accounts for the sequence-
dependent interactions between the nonspeciﬁc
DNA and the enzyme. The model is based on
the assumption that, in order to test whether
some special ”signal” associated with the pro-
moter is present, RNAP needs to ”read” the un-
derlying sequence while sliding, i.e. a sequence-
dependent interaction should be at work all dur-
ing the search. This means that the DNA
sequence can inﬂuence the dynamics of the

this sense, the stop at the promoter should
be the extreme eﬀect of a complex dynamics,
i.e. the RNAP should follow a noise-inﬂuenced,
sequence-dependent motion that includes the
possibility of slowing down, pauses and stops.
From this point of view the widely accepted as-
sumption of a standard random walk (i.e. with
a mean square deviation of the enzyme displace-
ment h∆n2i linearly dependent on time) of the
RNAP along DNA appears to be a practical but
incorrect simpliﬁcation.

As mentioned before, the nature of this “read-
ing” interaction, and therefore its strength and
its degree of sequence sensitivity, is unknown:
the sequence dependent ”signal” could be steric,
or mediated by chemical bonds, could depend
on the local DNA three-dimensional structure
(Travers, 1993) as well as on a speciﬁc set of
binding sites (Seeman et al., 1976), etc. Thus,
for instance, it has been shown that the E. Coli
RNAP holoenzyme bends DNA in correspon-
dence to the promoter (Schulz et al., 1998), so

that a sensitivity to the local DNA ﬂexibility

seems to be involved.
tween the same enzyme and the T7 DNA, nev-
ertheless, direct contacts between the β, β′ and
σ sub-units and DNA have been shown, this
suggesting their participation in the promoter
search (Park et al., 1982a). The recognition is in
any case associated with the base-pair sequence,
which determines the main structural and chem-
ical characteristics of the corresponding DNA
region.

To investigate the possibility of a sequence-
dependent diﬀusive motion of the RNAP along
DNA we shall use some crystallographic infor-
mation about sequence-dependent RNAP-DNA
interactions inside the promoter region. Outside
the promoter region, in fact, no experimental
information exists about this interaction, due
to the lower stability of the nonspeciﬁc com-
plexes. We shall then extrapolate it by assum-
ing that the enzyme and the DNA try to repro-
duce the same interaction as in the promoter re-
gion. This deﬁnes a base sequence energy land-
scape from which hopping rates of the enzyme
on the DNA (viewed as a discrete inhomoge-
neous lattice) can be deduced. The diﬀusive
motion of the RNAP is then studied by Monte
Carlo simulations of the the probabilistic pro-
cess on the landscape energy both in absence
and in presence of threshold values which de-
ﬁne diﬀerent rules for the hopping motion. As
a result we show that while at large times the
process reaches a pure diﬀusive regime, at the
initial stages it displays a sub-diﬀusive behavior.
The crossover from anomalous diﬀusion to nor-
mal diﬀusion may occur at times large enough
to be of biological interest. We will focus on
the speciﬁc example of the T7 RNA-polymerase
sliding on a 3000 bps DNA fragment of the bac-
teriophage T7.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1
we use some known information from crystallog-
raphy structure of the T7 RNAP-promoter com-
plex to introduce a sequence dependent model
for the RNAP-DNA nonspeciﬁc interaction. An
energy landscape with minima corresponding
to the recognition sequence GAGTC inside the
promoter is constructed. We then introduce
four possible models for the RNAP diﬀusive mo-
tion along DNA by using the sequence induced
energy landscape and its modiﬁcations, as the
inclusion of energy thresholds, which allow to
describe diﬀerent possible reading mechanisms.
The rates of translocation to the neighboring

2

sites are constructed from the energy landscapes
( for the diﬀerent models) by means of the Ar-
rhenius law. In Section 2 we use Monte Carlo
simulations to study in detail the diﬀerent dy-
namical regimes of our models. Finally, we dis-
cuss in Section 3 the limits of our analysis and
the possibility to check the results with experi-
ments, so to verify if the inferred mechanism ac-
tually corresponds to the real one, and we draw
our Conclusions.

1.1 T7 RNAP - DNA interaction
and promoter recognition

As mentioned in the Introduction, it is still not
well known which kind of sequence-dependent
interactions allow the polymerase to test the
DNA during the promoter search (Travers,
1993). To our knowledge, there are no exper-
imental investigations about the details of the
nonspeciﬁc polymerase-DNA complexes. The
stability of the RNAP-DNA nonspeciﬁc complex
is probably mainly due to electrostatic interac-
tion with the backbone phosphate of DNA (von
Hippel et al., 1996), i.e.
interactions that are
not sensible to the speciﬁc base-pair composi-
tion. On the other hand, the speciﬁc open com-
plex formed by the RNAP and its target pro-
moter is stable enough to be studied by crystal-
lography. Even if the open complex formation
requires a series of conformational rearrange-
ments that may change completely the set of
polymerase-DNA interactions, one can suppose
that at least some of the interactions observed
in the speciﬁc complex could be already present
during sliding, and might be used in the recogni-
tion mechanism. This hypothesis is interesting
also if the actual reading mechanism is not ex-
actly the same but of a similar type; the study
of the consequent dynamics may help, from a
more general point of view, in understanding
which kind of sequence-dependent interactions
are compatible with the experimental data.

Cheetham, Jeruzalemi and Steitz (Cheetam
et al., 1999) give a detailed analysis of the
polymerase-promoter open complex for the case
of bacteriophage T7, to which we will refer in the
following. From the crystallographic analysis, it

emerges that the T7 RNAP interacts with the
promoter in three regions 1. The ﬁrst interac-
tion is with the AT-rich region between positions
-17 to -13 relative to the starting site of tran-
scription. The N-terminal domain of the poly-
merase enters here in the minor groove of DNA,
and the helix appears to be distorted to form
a shallower minor groove, so that the recogni-
tion should be through the inherent ﬂexibility of
this AT-rich region. Secondly, a set of sequence-
speciﬁc bonds between protein side chains and
bases in the major groove arise in the region -11
to -7. In this case, the recognition is achieved
via the formation of hydrogen bonds with the
appropriate acceptor or donor chemical groups
in the base-pairs sides (See Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).
Finally, the polymerase opens the region from
-4 to -1 relatively to the starting site of tran-
scription, by inserting a β-hairpin and binding
the melted template strand.

Among the three polymerase-promoter inter-
actions mentioned above, the third one involves
a strand separation which arises only after the
promoter recognition, and is for this reason most
speciﬁc to the open complex formation. We will
therefore make the assumption that it does not
interfere directly in the promoter search. The
other two interactions are both possible can-
didates for a recognition mechanism. Here we
focus on the hydrogen bond mediated interac-
tion, that has the strongest sensitivity to the
basepairs, and we address the question if a spe-
ciﬁc interaction of this type can represent the
main reading tool which inﬂuences the poly-
merase motion. To this regard we remark that
the hydrogen bond acceptors and donors are reg-
ularly positioned on the promoter major groove:
the DNA geometry is in fact such that each of
the four diﬀerent basepairs exposes four possi-
ble major groove interacting sites as depicted in
Fig. 1 (Seeman et al., 1976). These sites can
be either H-bond acceptors and donors, or sites
where a hydrogen atom or a methyl group are

directly to polymerase (at least at the promoter
site). In Fig. 2 the H-bonds actually made be-
tween polymerase and DNA at the promoter,
as revealed by the crystallographic analysis, are
reported. The two semicircles in the left part
of Fig. 2 and their correspondent positions on
the right pattern, refer to the presence of a hy-

tor DNA groups respectively. White positions
correspond to hydrogen atoms and yellow ones
to methyl groups. Each basepair is associated
with a diﬀerent 1 × 4 pattern.

We shall assume that, in each position along
DNA, the RNAP “tries” to make the same set of
hydrogen bonds which corresponds to the pro-
moter, testing in this way the underlying se-
quence. It is convenient to represent the RNAP
by a recognition matrix able to match its target
sequence, i.e. containing the pattern of chemi-
cal active groups that allows the best binding at
the promoter. We suppose therefore that each
position along DNA will have a certain number
of made (matches) and unmade (mismatches)
hydrogen bonds with the polymerase recogni-
tion matrix. For simplicity, we will represent
the recognition pattern directly in terms of its
corresponding binding sites on DNA 2.

One expects that each match will stabilize the
complex, while mismatches will act as to desta-
bilize RNAP, that will tend therefore to move
away from the ”wrong” positions (von Hippel
and Berg, 1989; von Hippel et al., 1996). For
each position n along the chain we deﬁne an en-
ergy E(n), simply by counting the number of
matches and mismatches, and adding a corre-

2This is also a way to remind that we actually do
not include in the model all the possible polymerase-
DNA nonspeciﬁc bounds, but only those that are made
at the promoter, for which an experimental evidence is
available.

where the dot · denotes the usual matrix multi-
plication and tr is the trace. Minima correspond
to the complete matching and thus to the recog-
nition sequence GAGTC. Each positive or neg-
ative contribution to the energy, E, is equal to a
hydrogen bond energy. Note that the mobility of
RNAPs dramatically depends on βE. At room
temperature, kBT is about 0.025 eV (or RT =
0.6 kcal/mol, R = NakB); the energy barriers
must be smaller in order to allow the RNAP
to move and reach the promoter site3. Since
there are no direct measurements of the interac-
tion energies during sliding and it is diﬃcult to
make an estimate of the involved hydrogen bond
strength, we shall use βE as a free parameter.
The resulting energy E(n) deﬁnes an irregular
landscape on which the polymerase can move as
it will be discussed in the next subsection.

1.2 Sequence dependent RNAP

diﬀusive model

We shall introduce in this subsection four ver-
sions of the model corresponding to diﬀerent
mechanisms allowing the fundamental translo-
cation step in the enzyme motion. The length
of hydrogen bonds (up to 3.5 ˚A in DNA-protein
interactions (Nadassy et al., 1999)) can roughly
reach the same order of magnitude of the dis-
tance between base pairs (3.4 ˚A). So the RNAP
may eventually shift directly from one position
to the next one without activation energy for
If, on the contrary, the
the one step process.
3 This may seem not consistent with the usual mea-
sured strength of chemical hydrogen bonds, which nor-
mally corresponds to a few kcal/mol (Stryer, 1995; Voet
and Voet, 1995). The strength of one hydrogen bond is,
however, very sensitive to distance and orientation, so
that the relative position of the DNA and the reading
RNAP may be responsible of a relevant lowering of the
interaction energy.

Furthermore, RNAP could have some inter-
nal ﬂexibility allowing conformational changes,
eventually depending on the local degree of sta-
bility: i.e., it is possible that, if too many mis-
matches are found, RNAP should undergo a
conformational change from a ”reading” mode
to a ”sliding” mode, where no hydrogen bonds
are eﬀectively made (von Hippel et al., 1996). In
this case, one has a sort of two-states model, for
which, if the total energy E(n) is over a thresh-
old Et, the system passes to a diﬀerent state
of constant energy Esl where RNAP can freely
slide.

In order to have a ﬁrst insight over all these
possibilities, we deﬁne and analyze some diﬀer-
ent models, sketched in Fig. 3 and listed here-

after:

I) no threshold model: hydrogen bonds can
directly translate from one position to an-
other without being destroyed. In this case
the energy diﬀerence from n to n′ = n ± 1
∆E(n → n′) is simply

∆E(n → n′) = max[E(n′) − E(n), 0] ; (2)

here ∆E(n → n′) is set to zero if E(n′) −
E(n) is negative, as usual.

II) maximal threshold model: in order to reach
a next site, RNAP must destroy all bonds
and pass through a state of ”total mis-

EM − E(n), where EM = max[E(n)].

III) intermediate threshold model:

in order to
reach a next site, RNAP must pass through
an intermediate “zero” state deﬁned by a
threshold energy Et. One has therefore

∆E(n → n′) =

(3)

max[Et− E(n), E(n′) − E(n), 0] .

Models I and II are actually the two limiting
cases of model III when the threshold is set to
the minimum and maximum values of the po-
tential energy, respectively. These three models
could therefore be considered as three cases of
an unique model, just dependent on the choice
of the energy threshold. We will anyway refer to
these three cases as to models I , II and III in
the following, for aim of readability. Note that
in the general case of an intermediate threshold,
the previous model gives two diﬀerent possible
regimes for the polymerase, because the energy
proﬁle features change for regions where E(n)
is greater or lower than Et. On the basis of the
previous consideration, we also want to include
in our analysis a stronger separation between
sites of low or high matching. As mentioned,
we assume indeed that an additional conforma-
tional change unable RNAP to make hydrogen
bonds in the less favorable regions. We will de-
ﬁne therefore a fourth model as follows:

IV) two-regimes model: a threshold energy Et
separates “reading” regions, where the en-
ergy is E(n) < Et from “sliding” regions,
where no hydrogen bonds are made and
the RNA polymerase can freely diﬀuse on
a ﬂat energy landscape, E(n) = Esl. Be-
low the threshold, the barrier Et still aﬀect

the translocation as in case of model III.
For simplicity, we will ﬁx the value of Esl
to EM = max[E(n)]. In this case, one can
redeﬁne the energy as

E(n) =

E(n)
Esl

if E(n) < Et
if E(n) ≥ Et

(cid:26)

(4)

and the translocation barrier results to be
deﬁned as in case III .

Note that our model IV interpolates between
straight sequence-dependent walk (model I ) and
the biological model of the promoter search pro-
posed by von Hippel in Ref. (von Hippel and
Berg, 1989; von Hippel et al., 1996). The sce-
nario suggested by von Hippel relies indeed on
the idea that the speciﬁc interaction, given es-
sentially by the same hydrogen bond pattern
is “switch oﬀ” by a confor-
considered here,
mational change if too many mismatches are
present. RNAP is in this picture more often in
a “sliding” mode, where the speciﬁc hydrogen
bond interactions are inactive. A quantitative
description of this mechanism can be obtained
by the introduction of our model IV, where the
varying threshold level Esl accounts for the de-
gree of homology which leads to the supposed
RNAP conformational change.

The rates rn→n′ of translocation between
neighboring sites n and n′ are,
accord-
ing to the Arrhenius law, proportional to
exp (−β ∆E(n → n′)), where n′ = n ± 1. The
model includes a nonzero probability for the
polymerase to stop at one position; the com-
plete set of translocation rates reads therefore:

rn→n′ = 1/2 exp (−β ∆E(n → n′)),
n′ = n ± 1

rn→n = 1 − rn→n+1 − rn→n−1 .



(5)
Note that the case rn→n′ = 1/2 corresponds to
∆E(n → n′) = 0. This case is therefore equiv-
alent to the case of a (locally) constant energy
landscape, i.e. to a simple one-dimensional dif-
fusion process with diﬀusion constant D = 1/2

Let us now consider the distribution of en-
ergy levels that is obtained when the real T7

ergy landscape is evaluated through the local

the energy distribution evaluated on the whole
T7 sequence is represented. As it can be seen by
comparing with the superimposed ﬁt, the result-
ing distribution is, for models I to III , almost
Gaussian. Note that in the case of model IV all
contributions to levels above the threshold Et
are obviously condensed in a unique level Esl
(see Inset). The Gaussian distribution does not
indicate by itself which correlation properties
characterize the energy E(n). In order to have
insights on the correlation in the energy land-
scape, we have therefore analyzed its correlation
function and its spectrum, and compared with
the corresponding functions obtained by using
an artiﬁcial random DNA sequence. Roughly
speaking, the correlation function in both cases
is approximatively zero after 1 step. Neverthe-
less, some correlations, known to be present in
T7 DNA, namely the three-periodicity associ-
ated with the genetic code, results to be re-
ﬂected in the distributions of H-bond interaction
energies considered in our model.

2 Results: recognition eﬃ-
ciency and anomalous dif-
fusion

The ﬁrst important check of the four RNAP
models is related to their capability of ﬁnding
the promoter region. Theoretically, one can
easily estimate the stationary distribution of a
population of polymerase on the four diﬀerent

7

model landscapes as

ρ∞ (n) ∝ e−βE(n)

(6)

As usual, the stationary distribution only de-
pends on the site energy, and not on diﬀer-
ences and thresholds. As a consequence, mod-
els I to III have the same distribution, whereas
the redeﬁnition of energy in model IV leads to
a substantially diﬀerent result. Equation (6)
straightforwardly implies that the recognition
sites, which have the lower energy, will be in
average the most populated.

In order to verify that this is indeed obtained
in a dynamical context, we simulated numeri-
cally the time evolution of models I to IV tak-
ing as initial condition an uniform distribution
of independent RNAPs on a DNA region of
1000 base-pairs, with 30 polymerases per site.
Note that the assumption of an uniform ini-
tial distribution of a set of polymerases corre-
sponds, statistically, to consider the probabil-
ity evolution of a single polymerase binding to
DNA at random site. The simulation is per-
formed on the ﬁrst 3000 base-pairs region of the
T7 sequence, which contains two recognition se-
quences GAGTC, at positions 1126 and 1435.
We used here βE = 0.5.

After a suﬃciently long time, the polymerase
distribution ρ(n) spreads out, as shown in the
inset of Fig. 5, and shows a series of peaks cor-
responding to the sites with larger occupancy.
Where the border eﬀects can be neglected, this
distribution tends to its equilibrium limit; this
is shown in Fig. 5, where we plot a portion of
the distribution obtained after 106 time steps
for model I , together with ρ∞. As expected, the
larger peaks correspond to energy minima, i.e.
to the location of the two recognition sequences
GAGTC present in this DNA region. For all the
models I to III the ﬁnal distribution is similar,
with the two highest peaks exactly in correspon-
dence to the two recognition sequences, this con-
ﬁrming that the energy landscape deﬁned on the
basis of the pattern matching actually tends to
guide polymerases to the promoter recognition
sequences.

Note that, in case of model IV , the distribu-
tion of levels is diﬀerent, this obviously implying
a diﬀerent shape for ρ∞(n). The case of a suf-
ﬁciently low threshold energy is reﬂected on an
asymptotic distribution with rarer, larger picks
on a very low constant underground (data not
shown).

Figure 6: Diﬀusion behavior of model I for dif-
ferent values of βE. From the upper curve to the
bottom: βE = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5. Note
the log-log scale: a linear diﬀusion h∆n2i ∝ t
corresponds in this graph to the straight lines of
unit slope (solid lines), while slopes lower than
1 correspond to h∆n2i = A tb, with b < 1. A
(dashed) line of slope 0.3 is reported for com-
parison.

We now investigate the dynamical behavior
of the four models, and check if there are some
relevant deviations from random walk, induced
by the sequence sensitivity. For large values
of βE some positions along DNA could trap
polymerases for long times, this implying that,
at small and intermediate times, the diﬀusion
could be substantially diﬀerent than for a pure
random walk. In order to estimate this eﬀect,
we calculate the mean square deviation from the
average of the spatial displacement,

h∆n2i = h∆n2(t)i =

(ni(t) − ni(0))2 .

(7)

N

Xi=1

The average is made, at ﬁxed time, on N =
9 103 particles, initially distributed uniformly in
the DNA region [1000, 2000]. This procedure
therefore includes both an ensemble average on
a large number of particles and average on a
large set of initial conditions.

Starting from model I , we investigate the de-
pendence on βE of the diﬀusive behavior. Re-
sults are reported in Fig. 6.

In the limit of a βE = 0, i.e.

in the case of
a ﬂat underlying potential (or T = ∞), the dif-
fusion is of course standard, with D = 1/2 and
a linear dependence on time, so that the cor-

responding curve is a straight line of slope 1 in
the log-log plot. For larger values of βE (smaller
temperatures compared with the energy ﬂuctu-
ations), the dynamics of the model shows ini-
tially large deviations from the normal diﬀusion:
in these ﬁnite temperature cases, the motion is
initially subdiﬀusive, with

h∆n2i = A tb , b < 1 .

(8)

The exponent b increases then with time toward
its equilibrium value of 1. The initial deviation
(1 − b) and the time needed to reach the limit
b = 1 both increase with βE. This behavior
does not depend on the choice of the initial con-
ditions and it is not a transient induced by some
t = 0 properties: we have veriﬁed indeed that
qualitatively the same time dependence is repro-
duced after an initial transient time of 104, 105
or 106 time steps. As expected, once reached
the normal diﬀusion regime, diﬀerent tempera-
tures correspond to diﬀerent diﬀusion constants
D (in the log-log representation, 2D corresponds
to the oﬀset of the lines of slope 1, according to
the relation logh∆n2i = log 2D + log t).

As we will discuss later, the possibility to
observe, at small and intermediate times, an
anomalous diﬀusion, can be helpful in the com-
parison with experiments and, therefore, in the
ﬁt of the model parameters.

8

We will now extend the diﬀusion analysis to
the other versions of the model, introduced in
Section 1. Resulting curves for models I to IV
and for βE = 1 are reported in Fig. 7. We use
here Et = 0, in models III and IV, as an inter-
mediate value, corresponding to the condition of
a complete balance between matches and mis-
matches.

potential. Nevertheless, we have checked that it
is only due to the roughness of the landscape,
doing the same experiment on an artiﬁcial base
sequence, completely random. In the conditions
described by model I , for instance, and in the
same ﬁt range, we obtained b = 0.52 ± 1%, and
a curve that displays good agreement with the
T7 DNA case (data not shown).

four diﬀerent models, with βE = 1 and Et = 0,
in the log-log representation.
Symbols refer
respectively to: open circles, model I ; trian-
gles, model II ; diamonds, model III ; squares,
model IV (Et = 0). The straight lines corre-
spond to the ﬁt in the last part of the graphs
(t ∈ [6 106, 107]). Inset: the same curves in a
linear representation in the short time regime
(symbols have the same meaning).

As for model I , we observe in all cases a short
time regime where the diﬀusion displays anoma-
lous, subdiﬀusive features. The initial values of
the exponent b have been ﬁtted in the time range
(0, 100) through the function A tb and result to
be as follows for the ﬁrst three models:

I : b = 0.49 ± 1%

II : b = 0.61 ± 1%

III : b = 0.56 ± 1% .

Note that model IV displays in this short time
regime a particular behavior, that will be dis-
cussed in the following. The previous results
clearly display that a strong anomalous diﬀusion
caracterizes the initial time, due to the trapping
eﬀect of the rough energy landscape.

In principle, the anomalous diﬀusion observed
in our models could be due to some particular
spatial correlation properties of the underlying

Figure 8: Behavior of the exponent b as ﬁtted in
the short time regime t ∈ (0, 100) as a function
of the threshold energy Et for model III. The
vertical line corresponds to max[E(n)] = 5E.

For model III with varying threshold (i.e., in-
cluding model I and II ) it is interesting to study
the behavior of the short time subdiﬀusive ex-
ponent b as a function of Et. Such analysis is
reported in Fig. 8. For thresholds lower that a
critical value of about −3, the system displays
almost no sensitivity to the threshold level. This
is due to the fact that, in order to have some rel-
evant eﬀect, it is necessary to have not only a
site n with E(n) < Et, but also at least one
of its two neighboring sites should be below the
threshold. The probability of ﬁnding two adja-
cent sites below the threshold is too low below
for Et ≤ −3, this explaining the previous re-
sult.
Interestingly, the exponent b becomes a
nonmonotonic and very sensitive function of Et
for larger values of Et. The eﬀect of the thresh-
old in this intermediate regime is in fact twofold:
from one side, it induces an additional damp-
ing on many low energy sites, from the other, it
makes (a fraction of) these same sites “blind” to
the energies of their neighborings (the translo-
cation barriers only will depend on E(n) and
Et). The complex balance between the two con-
tributions induces the high instability of the ﬁt
results displayed in Fig. 8. As the threshold in-

creases above the maximum level (Et = 5), the
disorder of the underlying energy landscape be-
comes less and less important, and the system
tends to recover a standard diﬀusive behavior
strongly damped, i.e. with b → 1 and A(D) → 0
(the behavior of A is not shown in Fig. 8; for
Et > 12 E the dynamics becomes so slow that it
becomes impossible to ﬁt h∆n2i with our simu-
lation conditions).

The asymptotic (standard) diﬀusion constant
depends on the model choice. A linear ﬁt of the
large time regime of h∆n2i of Fig. 7 has been
done in order to have an estimate of the aver-
age diﬀusion constant D, in the random walk
approximation where h∆n2i = 2Dt. Besides,
we checked that an eﬀective linear behavior is
reached in the corresponding time range by ﬁt-
ting again with a function h∆n2i = A tb and
verifying that b is close to unity.

The standard diﬀusion limit is better achieved
for models displaying a faster diﬀusion. The re-
sulting diﬀusion constants D and the scaling ex-
ponents b for the four models in the large time
regime (t ∈ [6 106, 107]) are given, for Et = 0,
respectively by:

I :

II :
III :

IV :

2D = 4.1 10−3 ± 1%
2D = .23 10−3 ± 2%
2D = 4.0 10−3 ± 1%
2D = .32 10−3 ± 1%

b = 0.93 ± 1%

b = 0.86 ± 1%
b = 0.91 ± 1%

b = 0.85 ± 1% .(9)

The corresponding curves are reported by
straight lines in Fig. 7.

The diﬀerences in the equilibrium diﬀusion
constant between diﬀerent models are easily re-
lated to the eﬀect of the activation barrier in the
four cases: the highest is the threshold energy
to overcame in order to move of one step, the
lower is the diﬀusion. Note that in the case of
model IV the boundaries between ﬂat and orig-
inal potential regions act as energy barriers of
amplitude ≈ Esl: these barriers appear to aﬀect
the motion more strongly than the threshold Et,
this resulting in a diﬀusion constant closer to
that of model II than to model III .

As done for the parameter b in the short time
regime, we can analyze the dependence of the
asymptotic diﬀusion parameter 2D on Et. Fig. 9
shows indeed the behavior of the standard diﬀu-
sion parameter for diﬀerent values of Et (model
III). For technical reasons, we display data re-
sulting from the ﬁt in the range (8 105, 106), i.e.
in a region where the parameter b has not yet
reached unity. The curve of Fig. 9 represents

therefore only a qualitative analysis and shows
some small discrepancy with data given in Eq. 9.
Again, almost no sensitivity to the threshold
level is observed below a critical value, approxi-
matively Et = −3. Roughly between this value
and Et = 0, we observe a transition to a regime
of strong sentivity (Et > 0), where the damp-
ing eﬀect induced by the threshold is much more
enhanced. The diﬀusion constant tends to van-
ish just above the maximal energy (EM = 5,
vertical line), as intuitively expected, and in ac-
cordance to what happens for the short time
regime.

model IV , since it displays, with respect to the
others, a more complicated behavior. Note that,
in principle, model IV can be put exactly in the
same scheme of other models, once redeﬁned the
underlined potential E(n) according to Equa-
tion (4). Nevertheless, this redeﬁnition of the
energy landscape leads to substantial diﬀerent
features. As it can be observed in Fig. 10, dur-
ing an initial time laps the model diﬀuse more
rapidly, even if still subdiﬀusively, with initially
a larger instantaneous diﬀusion constant. The
initial speeding up of the dynamics is more im-
portant as the value of the threshold decreases,
i.e, as the energy redeﬁnition involves an in-
creasing number of sites. This eﬀect can be ex-
plained by considering how the potential land-
scape is changed for model IV . Among the par-
ticles, uniformly distributed at time zero over a
large region of the sequence, all those that are
initially on ﬂat regions of energy Esl will start

diﬀusing freely with diﬀusion constant equal to
1/2, until they fall down in one E < Et region.
These particles contribute initially to the diﬀu-
sion with a large term, thus making it increase.
After an initial transient, however, most of the
particles will be almost trapped in the poten-
tial wells, and a stationary distribution of the
particles will be reached, with a corresponding
stationary diﬀusion behavior.

More precisely, the trapping eﬀect will depend
on the value of Esl, set to max [E(n)] in our
calculations. If Esl is big enough, most of the
particles will be trapped in E(n) < Et regions,
with activation barriers and only a small proba-
bility to escape again toward the ﬂat plateaux.
Therefore, in the long time regime, the system
will be essentially in the same state model III ,
but mostly localized in some ﬁnite regions. Note
that, if the trapping were perfect, the limiting
diﬀusion constant would be zero: for ﬁnite, but
large enough Esl, there is a probability for par-
ticle to explore the whole space by overcoming
a boundary barrier, and therefore a nonzero dif-
fusion constant.
In other words, the particu-
lar equilibrium conditions introduced in model
IV are indeed such that one particle needs to
spend a large amount of energy (and, therefore,
of time) before reaching a high level plateau,
but once reached, it can move much faster to
the next favorable site.

An analytical derivation of the main dynami-
cal quantities as functions of the model param-
eters discussed in this section will be presented

11

in a forthcoming paper (Barbi et al., 2002).

3 Discussion

All the results presented in this work can be
checked by a comparison with detailed experi-
mental results. As mentioned in the Introduc-
tion, experiments leading to a rather precise de-
termination of the RNAP position along DNA
at diﬀerent times during the promoter search
have already appeared (Kabata et al., 1993;
Harada et al., 1999; Guthold et al., 1999), and
others are in preparation (Place et al., 2001).
This will give for the ﬁrst time the possibility
to estimate the detailed features of the poly-
merase diﬀusive motion. As we have shown,
a dynamical model which include the aﬃnity
for the promoter together with the possibility
of sliding, leads to a nontrivial sequence depen-
dent dynamics, at least in some range of the
parameters.

The mean sliding distance is kinetically evalu-
ated in diﬀerent experiments around 350 − 1000
bps ((Shimamoto, 1999) and references herein).
This is probably not peculiar to RNAP since
other enzymes interacting with DNA seems to
slide along the DNA for a short distance before
being released in solution (Stanford et al., 2000).
In this regime, the anomalous diﬀusion behavior
is predominant for our model. In particular, the
recent scanning force microscope (SFM) exper-
iment, performed by Guthold et al. (Guthold
et al., 1999), allows a direct observation of sin-
gle RNAPs sliding back and forth on a single
DNA chain partially adsorbed on a mica sur-
face, although with some technical limitations
(the average lifetime of the nonspeciﬁc com-
plex is more than hundred times larger than
what measured in solution, probably due to the
two-dimensional constraints). In Ref. (Guthold
et al., 1999), the statistical properties of the ob-
served diﬀusive motion have been ﬁtted by the
law h∆x2i ≃ 2D t, in order to conﬁrm the gen-
eral assumption that RNAP moves randomly
along DNA. Quantitatively, however, in the ob-
served displacement ranges (less than two hun-
dreds basepairs), the ﬁt seems to deviate from
a pure diﬀusive motion. This is perhaps due to
the experimental constraints and to the limited
number of RNAP sliding trajectories (about 30)
used in the experiment. Therefore, this obser-
vation suggests that a re-examination of these
direct AFM sliding measurements could be of

extreme interest. We have tried to extrapolate
the numerical data from Fig. 2 of Ref. (Guthold
et al., 1999) and to ﬁt the resulting h∆n2i with a
power law of the type Atb. This rough estimate
gives b ∼ 0.5 ± 15%. Even if in this experiment
the polymerase motion is probably slowed down
by some technical constraints, it is very interest-
ing to notice that the corresponding data seem
much better compatible with a subdiﬀusive be-
havior than to normal diﬀusion, as usually as-
sumed. This ﬁrst experiment allowing a direct
visualization of the RNAP sliding motion seems
to give therefore, from our point of view, some
intriguing and encouraging results.

We remark that the dynamical features de-
scribed here depend crucially on the choice of
the model parameters:
the ratio βE between
the typical bond energy E and the thermal en-
ergy kBT , the value of the energy threshold Et,
and, in the case of model IV , the energy of the
plateaux Esl. Further experimental investiga-
tions, devoted to the detailed determination of
the nonspeciﬁc interactions, are therefore nec-
essary to improve the model. The version of
the model resulting compatible with the sliding
RNAP dynamics of single molecule experiments
should emerge from comparisons with the ex-
perimental data, using the model parameters as
ﬁtting parameters. In practice, the complicated
diﬀusive behavior of the model will allow us to
compare theory and experiments by means of
more than one dynamical observable. For the
case of model IV , where the additional model
parameter Esl is needed, the presence of a new
short-time speciﬁc feature could be used in the
ﬁt of the experimental results.

From a biological point of view, the four mod-
els oﬀer a framework for deﬁning the pertinent
parameters to optimize the promoter search.
For all models, the speciﬁc interaction energy
between RNAP and DNA is crucial and should
be close to kBT in order to allow the polymerase
motion. This adjustment of the interaction en-
ergy can be achieved by varying the distance and
angle of the H-bonds during sliding. Diﬀerent
DNA interacting proteins should have developed
diﬀerent energy landscapes associated with this
interaction. The Et threshold, the activation
state to pass from one position to the next one,
and the βE parameter, both have a strong eﬀect
on the subdiﬀusive behavior of the protein at
the beginning of the DNA-protein interaction.
But perhaps, the more interesting model from
a biological point of view is model IV , since it

allows a more important control of the diﬀusion
pattern. An exact balance has to be found in bi-
ological system between the reading and sliding
mode. Et, Esl, and βE have to be optimized for
the biological purpose which will be physically
reﬂected by the protein-DNA interaction and by
the DNA sequence. Varying the diﬀusion pat-
tern will oﬀer more checkpoint in the control of
transcription initiation.

Finally,

it is important to stress that the
recognition mechanism through hydrogen bonds
considered here does not allow a complete iden-
tiﬁcation of the promoters. The occurrences
of the recognition sequence GACTC, or of the
complementary sequence GAGTC in the T7
genome are in fact more than 90; among them
only 10 are nevertheless appropriately combined
to weak (AT-rich) sequences in longer promoter-
like sequences of the type [weak]5-X-GACTC.
Evidently, other ”signals” must cooperate with
the direct pattern recognition mechanism in or-
der to allow the polymerase ﬁnd its target. A
sensitivity the the minor groove ﬂexibility is
a good candidate as an additional recognition
tool, also in consideration of similar results ob-
tained e.g. for the case of reverse transcriptase
(Lavigne and Buc, 1999). In this sense the pre-
sented model represents a ﬁrst attempt toward a
detailed description of the RNAP dynamics dur-
ing the promoter search. It can be improved by
including more details about the RNAP-DNA
interaction as they became available from new
experimental results. We believe, however, that
the main idea of the model, which is the link be-
tween base sequence and dynamics, will remain
Indeed, as far as a sequence
true in general.
dependence is considered, the enzyme will al-
ways interact through an eﬀective energy with
a pseudo-random ﬂuctuating proﬁle. The re-
sulting roughness can be generated by diﬀerent
kind of interactions, but is in principle suﬃcient
to obtain anomalous diﬀusion features as those
described in this paper.

Conclusions

In this paper we have proposed a simple model
for the RNAP sliding motion along DNA,
which include a sequence dependent interac-
tion. The nature of the actual interaction be-
ing poorly known, we deduced an hypotheti-
cal polymerase-DNA interaction from the crys-
tallographic structure of the T7 polymerase-

12

promoter complex (Cheetam et al., 1999). We
have included four possible variations by con-
sidering slightly diﬀerent translocation proba-
bilities, i.e. by the presence of a variable ac-
tivation barrier Et (leading to models I to III ),
and eventually by distinguishing “reading” re-
gions from “sliding” regions, where no hydrogen
bonds are made so that the RNAP can freely dif-
fuse at an eﬀective constant energy (model IV ).
The four versions of the model all lead to a
certain eﬃciency in the promoter recognition,
which is essentially limited by the trapping in
sites with a minor degree of homology. A nu-
merical study of the diﬀusion properties of the
model shows that a normal diﬀusion regime is
only achieved after an initial characteristic time.
We have shown as all the four models are charac-
terized at shorter times by a subdiﬀusive regime.
This result is of particular interest because, as
we have discussed, the anomalous diﬀusion is
observed in a range that corresponds approxi-
matively to the range of the experimental mean
distance covered by the RNAP during sliding
(Shimamoto, 1999). This particular behavior
can be easily compared with experiments, so
that the model parameters can be used as ﬁt-
ting parameters. We have analyzed the details
of the diﬀusion in the diﬀerent regimes and for
the diﬀerent models. Finally, we have described
the very short time behavior of the two-regimes
model, which displays richer features. The phys-
ical reasons underlying the diﬀerent diﬀusion be-
haviors have been discussed.

The ability of constraining and manipulat-
ing biological object represent actually the main
power of the sophisticated and exciting results
obtained at present days by nano-technologies
and single molecule experiments. The present
paper represents a ﬁrst step toward a theoreti-
cal picture where the new experimental results
could be correctly analyzed and connected with
the known functional properties of the corre-
sponding biological systems. In this respect, it
is also important to keep in mind that the in
vivo dynamics of the corresponding biological
processes occur in a high density environment,
characterized by very complex spatial structures
and mainly bound and structured water (Good-
sell, 1992). What we usually call the diﬀusive
motion of proteins inside the cell, is likely to be
instead a motion strongly dependent on a com-
plex set of environmental trapping sites, as in
the case considered here. In this respect, the ap-
proach proposed in this paper may have a larger

range of application.

Abstract

Water plays a key role in biological membrane transport. In ion channels
and water-conducting pores (aquaporins), one dimensional conﬁnement
in conjunction with strong surface eﬀects changes the physical behavior
of water.
In molecular dynamics simulations of water in short (0.8 nm)
hydrophobic pores the water density in the pore ﬂuctuates on a nanosec-
ond time scale. In long simulations (460 ns in total) at pore radii ranging
from 0.35 nm to 1.0 nm we quantify the kinetics of oscillations between
a liquid-ﬁlled and a vapor-ﬁlled pore. This behavior can be explained as
capillary evaporation alternating with capillary condensation, driven by
pressure ﬂuctuations in the water outside the pore. The free energy dif-
ference between the two states depends linearly on the radius. The free
energy landscape shows how a metastable liquid state gradually devel-
ops with increasing radius. For radii larger than ca. 0.55 nm it becomes
the globally stable state and the vapor state vanishes. One dimensional
conﬁnement aﬀects the dynamic behavior of the water molecules and in-
creases the self diﬀusion by a factor of two to three compared to bulk
water. Permeabilities for the narrow pores are of the same order of mag-
nitude as for biological water pores. Water ﬂow is not continuous but
occurs in bursts. Our results suggest that simulations aimed at collec-
tive phenomena such as hydrophobic eﬀects may require simulation times
longer than 50 ns. For water in conﬁned geometries, it is not possible to
extrapolate from bulk or short time behavior to longer time scales.

1 Introduction

Channel and transporter proteins control ﬂow of water, ions and other solutes
across cell membranes. In recent years several channel and pore structures
have been solved at near atomic resolution (1–6) which together with three
decades of physiological data (7) and theoretical and simulation approaches
(8) allow us to describe transport of ions, water or other small molecules
at a molecular level. Water plays a special role here: it either solvates the
inner surfaces of the pore and the permeators (for example, ions and small
molecules like glycerol), or it is the permeant species itself as in the aquaporin
family of water pores (9–11) or in the bacterial peptide channel gramicidin
A (gA), whose water transport properties are well studied (12–14). Thus,
a better characterization of the behavior of water would improve our un-
derstanding of the biological function of a wide range of transporters. The
remarkable water transport properties of aquaporins—water is conducted
through a long (ca. 2 nm) and narrow (ca. 0.3 nm diameter) pore at bulk dif-
fusion rates while at the same time protons are strongly selected against—are

2

the topic of recent simulation studies (15, 16).

The shape and dimensions of biological pores and the nature of the pore
lining atoms are recognized as major determinants of function. How the be-
havior of water depends on these factors is far from understood (17). Water
is not a simple liquid due to its strong hydrogen bond network. When con-
ﬁned to narrow geometries like slits or pores it displays an even more diverse
behavior than already shown in its bulk state (18, 19).

A biological channel can be crudely approximated as a “hole” through
a membrane. Earlier molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed pro-
nounced layering eﬀects and a marked decrease in water self diﬀusion in
inﬁnite hydrophobic pore models (20, 21). Recently, water in ﬁnite narrow
hydrophobic pores was observed to exhibit a distinct two-state behavior. The
cavity is either ﬁlled with water at approximately bulk density (liquid-like)
or it is almost completely empty (vapor-like) (22, 23). Similar behavior was
seen in Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations (GEMC) in spherical (24)
and cylindrical pores (25).

In our previous simulations (23) we explored model pores of the dimen-
sions of the gating region of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nAChR (26).
Hydrophobic pores of radius R ≥ 0.7 nm were ﬁlled during the whole simula-
tion time (up to 6 ns) whereas narrow ones (R ≤ 0.4 nm) were permanently
empty. Changing the pore lining from a hydrophobic surface to a more hy-
drophilic (polar) one rendered even narrow pores water—and presumably
ion—conducting. At intermediate radii (0.4 nm < R < 0.7 nm) the pore-
water system was very sensitive to small changes in radius or character of
the pore lining. In a biological context, a structure close to the transition
radius would confer the highest susceptibility to small conformational rear-
rangements (i.e. gating) of a channel.

We have extended these simulations to beyond 50 ns in order to explore
the longer timescale behavior of the water-pore system. Starting from the
observed oscillations in water density (Fig. 1a) we analyze the kinetics and
the free energy of the system. We compare the water transport properties of
the pores to experimental and theoretical data.

2 Methods

2.1 Model

The pore model was designed to mimic the dimensions of a biological pore
[e.g., the gate region of nAChR (26)], whilst retaining the tractability of a
simple model. Cylindrical pores of ﬁnite length were constructed from con-

The water density n(t) (in units of the bulk water density nbulk) over the simulation
time shows strong ﬂuctuations on a greater than ns time scale (50 ps moving
average smoothing). Two distinctive states are visible: open at approximately
nbulk (liquid water), and closed with very few or no water in the pore (water vapor).

centric rings of pseudo atoms (Fig. 1b). These hydrophobic pseudo atoms
have the characteristics of methane molecules, i.e. they are uncharged Lennard-
Jones (LJ) spheres with a van der Waals radius of 0.195 nm. The pore con-
sists of two mouth regions (radius RM = 1 nm, length LM = 0.4 nm) and
an inner pore region (LP = 0.8 nm) of radius 0.35 nm ≤ R ≤ 1.0 nm, which
is the minimum van der Waals radius of the cavity. The centers of the pore
lining atoms are placed on circles of radius R + 0.195 nm. The model was
embedded in a membrane mimetic, a slab of pseudo atoms of thickness ca.
1.5 nm or 1.9 nm. Pseudo atoms were harmonically restrained to their initial
position with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−2, resulting in positional
ﬂuctuations of ca. 0.1 nm, comparable to those of pore lining atoms in mem-
brane protein simulations although this does not allow for global collective
motions as in real proteins.

2.2 Simulation Details
MD simulations were performed with gromacs v3.0.5 (27) and the SPC
water model (28). The LJ-parameters for the interaction between a methane
molecule and the water oxygen are ǫCO = 0.906493 kJ mol−1 and σCO =
0.342692 nm from the gromacs force ﬁeld. The integration time step was
2 fs and coordinates were saved every 2 ps. With periodic boundary con-
ditions, long range electrostatic interactions were computed with a particle
mesh Ewald method [real space cutoﬀ 1 nm, grid spacing 0.15 nm, 4th order
interpolation (29)] while the short ranged van der Waals forces were calcu-
lated within a radius of 1 nm. The neighbor list (radius 1 nm) was updated
every 10 steps.

Weak coupling algorithms (30) were used to simulate at constant temper-
ature (T = 300 K, time constant 0.1 ps) and pressure (P = 1 bar, compress-
ibility 4.5 × 10−5 bar−1, time constant 1 ps) with the x and y dimensions of
the simulation cell held ﬁxed at 6 nm (or 3.9 nm for the 80 ns simulation of
the R = 0.35 nm pore). The length in z was 4.6 nm in both cases (ensuring
bulk-like water behavior far from the membrane mimetic).

The large (small) system contained about 700 (300) methane pseudo
atoms and 4000 (1500) SPC water molecules. Simulation times Tsim ranged
from 52 ns to 80 ns (altogether 460 ns). Bulk properties of SPC water were
obtained from simulations in a cubic cell of length 3 nm (895 molecules) with
isotropic pressure coupling at 300 K and 1 bar for 5 ns.

2.3 Analysis

Time courses and density For the density time courses (Fig. 1a) the pore
occupancy N(t), i.e. the number of water molecules within the pore cavity
(a cylinder of height LP = 0.8 nm containing the pore lining atoms) was
counted. The density n(t) is given by N(t) divided by the water-accessible
pore volume V = LP πR2
eﬀ and normalized to the bulk density of SPC water
at 300 K and 1 bar (nbulk = 53.67 ± 0.03 mol l−1). The eﬀective pore radius
for all pores is Reﬀ = R − δR. Choosing δR = 0.03 nm ﬁxes the density
hNi/V in the (most bulk-like) R = 1.0 nm-pore at the value calculated from
R0
the radial density, R−1
0 n(r) dr, where R0 = 1.05 nm is the radius at which
0 R
n(r) vanishes.

The density n(r) was determined on a grid of cubic cells with spacing
0.05 nm. Two- and one-dimensional densities were computed by integrating
out the appropriate coordinate(s). A probabilistic interpretation of n(r) leads
to the deﬁnition of the potential of mean force (PMF) of a water molecule
βF (r) = − ln[n(r)/nbulk] with β−1 = kBT , via Boltzmann-sampling of states.

Free energy density and chemical potential The Helmholtz free en-
ergy as a function of the pore occupancy N at constant T = 300 K for a
given pore with volume V was calculated from the probability distribution
p(N) of the occupancy as βF (T, V, N) = − ln p(N) and transformed into a
free energy density f (T, n) = F/V . A fourth order polynomial in n was least-
square ﬁtted to βf (T, n). The chemical potential µ(T, n) = ∂f (T, n)/∂n was
calculated as the analytical derivative of the polynomial.

The βf curves obtained for diﬀerent radii R from the simulations are
only determined within an unknown additive constant f0(T ; R) but a ther-
modynamic argument shows that all these curves coincide at n = 0: For
n = 0 no water is in the pore, so the free energy diﬀerential is simply
dF = −S dT + 2γ dA with the constant surface tension of the vacuum
(inside the pore)-water (outside) interface of area A = πR2. At constant
T this implies F (R) = 2γ A + const(T ), so that the free energy density
f (T, n = 0; R) = F (R)/V = 2γ A/(L A) = 2γ/L of a pore with radius R
and length L is independent of R. Hence, all free energy density curves
necessarily coincide at n = 0 and f0 is a function of T only.

Kinetics The time series n(t)/nbulk of the water density in the pore was
analyzed in the spirit of single channel recordings (31) by detecting open
(high-density; in the following denoted by a subscript o) and closed (approx-
imately zero density; subscript c) pore states, using a Schmitt-trigger with

6

an upper threshold of 0.65 and a lower threshold of 0.15 . A characteris-
tic measure for the behavior of these pores is the openness hωi = To/Tsim,
i.e. the probability for the pore being in the open state (23) with errors
estimated from a block-averaging procedure (27). The distribution of the
lifetimes tα of state α = {o, c} are exponentials τ −1
α e−tα/τα (data not shown).
The maximum-likelihood estimator for the characteristic times τo and τc is
the mean τα = htαi.

The free energy diﬀerence between closed and open state, ∆F = Fc − Fo,
can be calculated in two ways. Firstly, we obtained it from the equilibrium
constant K = Tc/To = (Tsim − To)/To = hωi−1 − 1 of the two-state system
as β ∆Fkin = − ln K. Secondly, ∆F was determined from p(N) as the ratio
between the probability that the pore is in the closed state and the probability
for the open state: β ∆Feq = − ln Pc/Po = − ln PN ≤N ‡ p(N)/ PN >N ‡ p(N).
The deﬁnition of state used here is independent of the kinetic analysis. It
only depends on N ‡, the pore occupancy in the transition state, the state of
lowest probability between the two probability maxima that deﬁne the closed
and open state. The relationship involving K can be inverted to describe the
openness in terms of ∆F (R), hω(R)i = (cid:0)1 + exp[−β ∆F (R)](cid:1)

Dynamics The three components of the self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient were cal-
(cid:11) = 2Di (t − t0). The
culated from the Einstein relations (cid:10)(cid:0)xi(t) − xi(t0)(cid:1)
simulation box was stratiﬁed perpendicular to the pore axis with the central
layer containing the pore. During Tsim the mean square deviation (msd) of
water molecules in a given layer was accumulated for 10 ps and after dis-
carding the ﬁrst 2 ps, a straight line was ﬁt to the msd to obtain Di. These
diﬀusion coeﬃcients were averaged in each layer for the ﬁnal result.

2

The current density (ﬂux per area) was calculated as j0 = Φ0/A from
the equilibrium ﬂux Φ0 = M/Tsim with the total number of permeant water
molecules M and the eﬀective pore cross section A = πR2
eﬀ for pores or
A = LxLy for the bulk case, i.e. a simulation box of water with periodic
boundary conditions. Permeant water molecules were deﬁned as those whose
pore entrance and exit z-coordinate diﬀered.
In addition, distributions of
permeation times were computed.

3 Results and Discussion

The water density in the pore cavity oscillates between an almost empty
(closed) and ﬁlled (open) state (Fig. 1a). We refer to the water-ﬁlled pore
state as open because such a pore environment would favorably solvate an ion
and conceivably allow its permeation. Conversely, we assume that a pore that

pore. Right column: radially averaged density. The density is in units of SPC

cannot sustain water at liquid densities will present a signiﬁcant energetic
barrier to an ion. As shown in Fig. 1c, water molecules can pass each other
and often permeate the pore in opposite directions simultaneously.

Even though the oscillating behavior was already suggested by earlier 1 ns
simulations (23) only at these longer times do clear patterns emerge. The
characteristics of the pore-water system change substantially with the pore
radius. The oscillations (Fig. 1a) depend strongly on the radius. The water
shows large pores to be water-ﬁlled and strongly layered
density (Fig. 2)
at bulk density. With decreasing radius the average density is reduced due
to longer closed states even though layer structures remain. The narrowest
pores appear almost void of water.

The sudden change in behavior is borne out quantitatively by the open-
ness (Fig. 3a), which indicates a sharp increase with increasing radius around
R = 0.55 nm. Although the range of radii over which this transition takes
place appears to be small (0.45 nm to 0.7 nm) the cross-sectional area dou-
bles. The maximum number of water molecules actually found in the cavity
in our simulations more than doubles from 21 to 46 in this range of R, so

occupancy (∆Feq). (b) Radial potential of mean force of water F (r). Very narrow
pores show a relatively featureless PMF, consistent with a predominantly vapor-

that the average environment which each water molecule experiences changes
considerably.

Density The radial densities in Fig. 2 show destabilisation of the liquid
phase with decreasing pore radius. Above R = 0.45 nm distinctive layering
is visible in the pore, and for the larger pores appears as an extension of the
planar layering near the slab. For R < 0.45 nm no such features remain and
the density is on average close to 0. The open state can be identiﬁed with
liquid water and the closed state with water vapor. In the continuously open
1 nm-pore, the average density hn(t)i/nbulk is 0.82, but 0.032 in the closed
0.35 nm-pore. Brovchenko et al. (33) carried out GEMC simulations of the
coexistence of liquid TIP4P water with its vapor in an inﬁnite cylindrical
hydrophobic pore of radius R = 1.075 nm. At T = 300 K they obtained a
liquid density of 0.81 and a vapor density close to 0, in agreement with the
numbers from our MD simulations.

Analysis of the structure in the radial PMF (Fig. 3b) lends further support
to the above interpretation. Water molecules ﬁll the narrow pores (R /
0.45 nm) homogeneously as it is expected for vapor. For the wider pores,
distinct layering is visible as the liquid state dominates. The number of layers
increases from two to three, with the central water column being the preferred
position initially. As the radius increases, the central minimum shifts toward
the wall. For R = 0.7 nm the center of the pore is clearly disfavored by
0.2 kBT . In the largest pore (R = 1.0 nm), the inﬂuence of curvature on the
density already seems to be negligible as it is almost identical to the situation
near a planar hydrophobic slab.

Kinetics Condensation (ﬁlling of the pore) and evaporation (emptying)
occur in an avalanche-like fashion as shown in Fig 1c.
In our simulations
both events take place within ca. 30 ps, roughly independent of R. However,
the actual evaporation and condensation processes seem to follow diﬀerent
paths, as we can infer from the analysis of the kinetics of the oscillations.
The time series of Fig. 1a reveals that the lifetimes of the open and closed
state behave diﬀerently with increasing pore radius (Fig. 3c): In the range
0.45 nm ≤ R ≤ 0.6 nm, the average time a pore is in the closed state is
almost constant, τc = 1.40 ± 0.37 ns; outside this range no simple functional
relationship is apparent. The average open time can be described as an
exponential τo(R) = a exp(R/ζ) with a = 1.3×10−5 ns and ζ = 4.9×10−2 nm
for 0.35 nm ≤ R ≤ 0.7 nm.

1/τo is related to the “survival probability” of the liquid state and 1/τc
to that of the vapor state. These times characterize the underlying physical

10

evaporation and condensation processes. Their very diﬀerent dependence on
R implies that these processes must be quite diﬀerent. The initial condensa-
tion process could resemble the evaporation of water molecules from a liquid
surface. Evaporating molecules would not interact appreciably, so that this
process would be rather insensitive to the area of the liquid-vapor interface
A = πR2 and hence R. The disruption of the liquid pore state, on the other
hand, displays very strong dependence on the radius. Conceivably, the pore
empties once a density ﬂuctuation has created a vapor bubble that can ﬁll
the diameter of the pore and expose the wall to vapor, its preferred contact
phase. The probability for the formation of a spherical cavity of radius λ
with exactly N water molecules inside was determined by Hummer et al.
(34). From their study we ﬁnd that the probability p(λ; n) for the formation
of a bubble of radius λ and density below a maximum density n is apparently
an exponential. Once a bubble with λ ≈ R develops, the channel rapidly
empties but this occurs with a probability that decreases exponentially with
increasing R, which corresponds to the observed exponential increase in τo.
In particular, for low density bubbles (n < 0.2 nbulk) we estimate the decay
constant in p(λ; n) as 2 × 10−2 nm, which is of the same order of magnitude
as ζ.

From the equilibrium constant K(R) = Tc(R)/To(R) = exp[−β ∆F (R)]
the free energy diﬀerence between the two states ∆F = Fc − Fo can be
calculated. ∆F increases linearly with the pore radius (inset of Fig. 3a),
β ∆F (R) = a0 + a1R with akin
1 = 23.7 ± 3.0 nm−1.
Together with K(R), the gating behavior of the pore is characterized (31).
In this sense, the MD calculations have related the input structure to a
“physiological” property of the system. (Note, however, that the time scales
of ion channel gating and of the oscillations observed here diﬀer by ﬁve orders
of magnitude.)

Free energy density The Helmholtz free energy density f (T, n; R) dis-
plays one or two minima (Fig. 4a): one for the empty pore (n = 0) and
one in the vicinity of the bulk density. The 0.45 nm pore is close to a tran-
sition point in the free energy landscape: the minimum for the ﬁlled pore
is very shallow and disappears at smaller radii (R = 0.4 nm and 0.35 nm).
For very large and very small radii, only one thermodynamic stable state
exists:
liquid or vapor. For intermediate radii, a metastable state appears.
Near R = 0.55 nm both states are almost equally probable although they do
not coexist spatially because the pore is ﬁnite and small. In inﬁnite pores
spatially alternating domains of equal length would be expected (35) and
were actually observed in MD simulations (36). The oscillating states in

and for R > 0.55 nm the liquid state is globally stable. f (T, n; R = 1.0 nm) is
drawn with an arbitrary oﬀset.

short pores, on the other hand, alternate temporally, thus displaying a kind
of “time-averaged” coexistence. For higher densities n/nbulk > 1 the curves
start to resemble parabolas, similar to a parabolic f (T, n) seen for cylindrical
volumes (data not shown) and spherical cavities (34) in bulk water.

The chemical potential (Fig. 4b) shows the transition from the stable
vapor state, µ(T, n) > 0, through the two-state regime to the stable liquid
state, µ(T, n) < 0. The features of µ(T, n) indicate that the condensation
(and evaporation) processes occur in an avalanche-like fashion: Let the den-
sity in the pore be at the transition state, the left zero of µ. If the density
is perturbed to increase slightly then µ becomes negative. Every additional
molecule added to the pore decreases the free energy further by an amount µ
while the increase in density lowers the chemical potential even more. This
leads to the avalanche of condensation. It only stops when the stable state,
the right zero of µ, is reached. Now a further addition of molecules to the
pore would actually increase the free energy and drive the system back into
the stable state. Similarly, a perturbation that decreases the density in the
transition state leads to accelerated evaporation.

Fig. 3a) shows the transfer of stability from the vapor state for small R to the
liquid state for large R. The coexistence regime is at ∆F (Rc = 0.57 nm) = 0.

Dynamics MD simulations not only allow us to investigate the thermody-
namic properties of the system but also the dynamical behavior of individual
molecules. A few selected water molecules are depicted in Fig. 1c shortly
before the pore empties. They show a diverse range of behaviors and no
single-ﬁle like motion of molecules is visible in the liquid state. On evapora-
tion (and condensation) the state changes within ca. 30 ps.

The mean permeation time hτpi in Table 1 increases with the pore ra-
dius, i.e. water molecules permeate narrow hydrophobic pores faster than
they diﬀuse the corresponding distance in bulk water (the reference value).
This is consistent with higher diﬀusion coeﬃcients Dz in the narrow pores
(up to almost three times the bulk value). The diﬀusion coeﬃcient perpen-
dicular to the pore axis, Dxy, drops to approximately half the bulk value.
Mart´ı and Gordillo (37) also observe increased diﬀusion in simulations on
water in carbon nanotubes (Dz ≤ 1.65 Dbulk) and a corresponding decrease

13

in Dxy. Experimental studies on water transport through desformyl gA (13)
can be interpreted in terms of a Dz of ﬁve times the bulk value. Histograms
(data not shown) for τp show that there is a considerable population of ‘fast’
water molecules (e.g. the black and the dark gray one in Fig. 1c) with τp
between 2 and 10 ps, which is not seen in bulk water. The acceleration of
water molecules in the pore can be understood as an eﬀect of 1D conﬁne-
ment. The random 3D motion is directed along the pore axis and the particle
advances in this direction preferentially. The eﬀect increases with decreasing
radius, i.e. increasing conﬁnement. The average equilibrium current density
j0 follows the trend of the openness closely but more detailed time-resolved
analysis shows water translocation to occur in bursts in all pores. In narrow
pores, bursts occurring during the “closed” state contribute up to 77% of the
total ﬂux (data not shown). For single-ﬁle pores, simulations (14, 22) and
theory (38) also point towards concerted motions as the predominant form
of transport.

Capillary condensation The behavior as described so far bears the hall-
marks of capillary condensation and evaporation (19, 39, 40) although it
is most often associated with physical systems which are macroscopically
extended in at least one dimension such as slits or long pores. Capillary
condensation can be discussed in terms of the Kelvin equation (18),

ln

which describes how vapor at pressure p relative to its bulk-saturated pressure
p0 coexists in equilibrium with its liquid. Liquid and vapor are divided by an
interfacial meniscus of curvature 1/r (r > 0 if the surface is convex); γlv is
the surface tension between liquid and vapor and vl the molecular volume of
the liquid. Although the Kelvin equation is not expected to be quantitative
in systems of dimensions of only a few molecular diameters it is still useful
for obtaining a qualitative picture. Curvature 1/r and contact angle θ in
a cylindrical pore of radius R are related by R = r cos θ. With Young’s
equation, γwv = γwl + γlv cos θ, Eq. 1 becomes

ln

independent of the interface. For our system, the surface tension between
liquid water and the wall, γwl > 0, and between vapor and the wall, γwv > 0,
are ﬁxed quantities. The hydrophobicity of the wall implies γwv < γwl, i.e.
the wall is preferentially in contact with vapor; vl can be considered constant.

14

Hence, for a given pore of radius R there exists one vapor pressure p(R) > p0
at which vapor and liquid can exist in equilibrium. Water only condenses in
the pore if the actual vapor pressure exceeds p(R). Otherwise, only vapor
will exist in the pore. The eﬀect is strongest for very narrow pores. Hence
a higher pressure is required to overcome the surface contributions, which
stabilize the vapor phase in narrow pores. The pressure ﬂuctuates locally
in the liquid bulk “reservoir.” These ﬂuctuations can provide an increase in
pressure above the saturation pressure in the pore and thus drive oscillations
between vapor and liquid.

Comparison with experiments, simulations, and a theoretical model
Experiments on aquaporins (9, 10) and gA (12, 13) yield osmotic perme-
ability coeﬃcients of water, pf , of the order of 10−12 to 10−14 cm3s−1. We
calculate pf = 1
2Φ0vl from the equilibrium ﬂux of our MD simulations (14)
and ﬁnd that narrow (R = 0.35 nm and 0.4 nm), predominantly “closed”
pores have pf ≈ 5 × 10−14 cm3s−1, that is, the same magnitude as Aqp1,
AqpZ, and gA (see Table 2). As these pores are longer (ca. 2 nm) and nar-
rower (R < 0.2 nm) than our model pores, strategically placed hydrophilic
groups (15) seem to be needed to stabilize the liquid state and facilitate water
transport in these cases.

Recently Giaya and Thompson (41) presented an analytical mean-ﬁeld
model for water in inﬁnite cylindrical hydrophobic micropores. They predict
the existence of a critical radius Rc for the transition from a thermodynam-
ically stable water vapor phase to a liquid phase. The crucial parameter
that Rc depends on is the water-wall interaction. We choose the eﬀective
ﬂuid-wall interaction ǫeﬀ = ρw ǫf w, the product of the density of wall atoms
with the well-depth of the ﬂuid-wall interaction potential, as a parameter to
compare diﬀerent simulations because this seems to be the major component
in the analytical ﬂuid-wall interaction. As shown in Table 3, compared to
carbon nanotube simulations our pore has a very small ǫeﬀ and thus can be
considered extremely hydrophobic. This explains why Hummer et al. (22)
observe permanently water ﬁlled nanotubes with a radius of only 0.24 nm al-
though their bare ﬂuid-wall interaction potential is weaker than in our model.
The much higher density of wall atoms in the nanotube, however, more than
mitigates this. Once they lower their ǫeﬀ to double of our value, they also ob-
serve strong evaporation. This suggests that the close packing of wall atoms
within a nanotube may result in behavior not seen in biological pores. The
mean ﬁeld model agrees qualitatively with the simulations as it also shows a
sharp transition and high sensitivity to ǫeﬀ.

4 Conclusions

We have described oscillations between vapor and liquid states in short
(LP = 0.8 nm), hydrophobic pores of varying radius (0.35 nm≤ R ≤ 1.0 nm).
Qualitatively, this behavior is explained as capillary evaporation, driven by
pressure/density ﬂuctuations in the water “reservoir” outside the pore. Sim-
ilar behavior is found in simulations by diﬀerent authors with diﬀerent water
models [SPC (this work), SPC/E, TIP3P (data not shown), TIP3P (22),
TIP4P (25)] in diﬀerent nanopores [atomistic ﬂexible models (this work),
carbon nanotubes (22), spherical cavities (24) and smooth cylinders (25, 42)].
We presented a radically simpliﬁed model for a nanopore that is perhaps
more hydrophobic than in real proteins [although we note the existence of a
hydrophobic pore in the MscS channel (6)]. From comparison with experi-
mental data on permeability we conclude that strategically placed hydrophilic
groups are essential for the functioning of protein pores. The comparatively
high permeability of our “closed” pores suggests pulsed water transport as
one possible mechanism in biological water pores. Local hydrophobic en-
vironments in pores may promote pulsatory collective transport and hence
rapid water and solute translocation.

Our results indicate new, intrinsically collective dynamic behavior not
seen on simulation time scales currently considered suﬃcient in biophysical
simulations. These phase oscillations in simple pores—a manifestation of
the hydrophobic eﬀect—require more than 50 ns of trajectory data to yield

17

a coherent picture over a free energy range of 6 kBT . We thus cannot safely
assume that the behavior of water within complex biological pores may be
determined by extrapolation from our knowledge of the bulk state or short
simulations alone.

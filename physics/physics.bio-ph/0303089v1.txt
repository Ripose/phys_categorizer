Abstract

The possible normal modes of vibration of a nearly spherical virus particle are discussed.

Two simple models for the particle are treated, a liquid drop model and an elastic sphere

model. Some estimates for the lowest vibrational frequency are given for each model. It is

concluded that this frequency is likely to be of the order of a few GHz for particles with a

radius of the order of 50nm.

INTRODUCTION

Virus particles (virions) come in a variety of sizes and shapes. However, approx-
imately spherical shapes with diameters in the range between 50nm and 100nm are
especially common. Many nearly spherical viruses are revealed by X-ray crystal-
lography to have icosahedral symmetry. A typical virus particle contains genetic
material, RNA or DNA, surrounded by a protein coat (capsid). Such an object
should have reasonably distinct vibrational frequencies, the study of which may be
of interest. Excitation of these vibrations could have applications in either the diag-
nosis or treatment of viral diseases. To this author’s knowledge, the sole discussion
of these vibrational modes in the literature is that of Babincov´a et al [1]. These
authors discuss the conjecture that ultrasound in the GHz range could be resonantly
absorbed by HIV virus particles, leading to their destruction. Cooper et al [2] have
recently reported the detection of viruses by acoustic oscillations. However, the pro-
cess of “rupture event scanning”, which these authors report, involves the separation
of a virus particle from antibodies by ultrasound. This is distinct from the excita-
tion of the vibrational modes of the virus particle itself, and occurs at much lower
frequencies.

There have also been some experimental studies of ultrasonic absorption by empty
viral capsids [3, 4]. These experiments reveal an enhanced absorption in the MHz
range as proteins reassemble into a capsid, but do not ﬁnd a resonant peak in this
frequency range. Witz and Brown [5] have emphasized that these and other results
show that viral capsids are ﬂexible and change size or shape in response to vibrations
or to changes in temperature or pH.

The purpose of the present paper is to provide some estimates of the lowest vibra-
tional frequencies of a spherical virus particle. The simplest estimate is to take this
frequency to be of the order of a characteristic speed of sound divided by the size of
the virus particle. This is the estimate used in Ref. [1]. For the purpose of giving a
more accurate estimate, we will examine two models, which treat the particle (1) as
a liquid drop and (2) as a uniform elastic sphere. Similar models have been used by
Bulatov et al [6] to estimate the vibrational frequencies of nanoclusters.

II. A LIQUID DROP MODEL

Consider a sphere of radius a ﬁlled with a nonviscous liquid with surface tension γ
and mass density ρ. The lowest vibrational mode of this sphere will be a quadrupole
mode with frequency [7]

which can be written as

TABLE I: The mass density, surface tension, and the lowest vibrational frequency predicted

by Eq. (2) for drops of various liquids with a radius of a = 50nm. The data for Benzene

and Diethylene glycol [8] are for droplets in air at room temperature. The data for the
three proteins [9] are for aqueous solutions at approximately 50◦C.

where ρW = 103kg/m3 and γW = 0.073Nm are the mass density and surface tension
for water, respectively. The surface tension and mass density, along with the lowest
vibrational frequency derived from Eq. (2) for a = 50nm, are given in Table 1 for
several liquids.

Recall that Eq. (2) assumes a nonviscous liquid. In fact, the viscosity of many
of the liquids in Table 1 cannot be neglected for such a small drop. When viscosity
is suﬃciently large, the drop will not oscillate, but rather undergo overdamped mo-
tion [7]. The main lesson from the liquid drop model is that a nonviscous liquid drop
of a = 50nm with a typical surface tension and mass density would have a lowest
vibrational frequency of the order of a few times 108Hz.

III. AN ELASTIC SPHERE MODEL

A better model for a virus particle is to treat it as a uniform elastic sphere. The
three independent parameters which characterize such a sphere can be taken to be
the radius a, the speed of pressure waves, cP , and the speed of shear waves, cS. The
oscillations of an elastic sphere are treated in detail by Pao and Mow [10]. Here we
quote their results in the notation of Ref. [6]. The eigenfrequencies of the normal
modes are given by the vanishing of the determinant

Here x = ωa/cP , y = ωa/cS, and the jn are spherical Bessel functions. Let

be the ratio of the speed of the shear wave to that of the pressure wave, so that y = bx.
Given b and n, we can solve Eq. (3) for x and hence for the frequency of the normal
mode, ν = x cP /(2πa). The smallest roots for x for the n = 0 and n = 2 modes are
plotted in Fig. 1. The corresponding frequencies of oscillation can be expressed as

The frequencies obtained from this equation for the n = 0 mode are given in Table
II for various materials.

We can see that for a wide range of materials, the lowest mode of vibration is a
purely radial mode with a frequency of the order of a few times 109Hz for a sphere
of radius a = 50nm.

cases where no data for cS are available, the frequency is given as a multiple of x, which is

likely to be less than one for these materials.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the previous sections, we have examined two models for a spherical virus par-
ticle, a liquid drop model and an elastic sphere model. It is of interest that the two
models yield estimates for the lowest vibrational frequency which diﬀer by only about
one order of magnitude. Of the two models, the elastic sphere model is probably the
better description of a virus particle. An even better model might be one in which
the particle has a liquid core (DNA or RNA) surrounded by an elastic outer shell
(the capsid). Such a model would probably yield vibrational frequencies intermediate
between those predicted by the two models discussed in this paper. In any case, we
obtain an estimate for the lowest vibrational frequency of the same order of magni-
tude as that given in Ref. [1], in the range of a few GHz for particles with a size of
about 100nm. Of course, the existence of a resonance requires that damping be below
the critical value above which overdamped motion occurs. Even if this condition is
fulﬁlled, it is diﬃcult to predict the width of the resonance. This remains a question
for experimental investigation. The existence of well deﬁned resonances could prove
valuable both for basic science and for medicine. Thus this is a potentially fruitful
area for further research.

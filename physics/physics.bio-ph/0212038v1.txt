1 Introduction

Membrane-spanning peptides such as the ion channel gramicidin dimer, cause
membrane deformation which contribute signiﬁcantly to both the energetics of
the insertion and the membrane-mediated interaction between the channels.
Recently, interest in this ﬁeld shifted from study of individual channels to study
of collective eﬀects in channel kinetics. Here we discuss an eﬃcient way to
describe the membrane-mediated interaction between the insertions in terms of
coupled harmonic oscillators and corresponding ”spring constants”.

2 Variational principle, boundary conditions and

Euler-Lagrange equation.

We consider an elastic system extended in x, y−plane, where the deforma-
tion can be described by a 2−dimensional ﬁeld of ”vertical” displacement u(r)
(r = (x, y) is the radius vector in the mid-plane of the system). The examples
include smectic and similar models for lipid bilayers , and ”ﬂoating plate” model
of classical elastic theory (see [1] for review).

The elastic boundary problem can be formulated as a variational (minimum)

principle for the energy functional

F (2)[u] =

g(2)(u, ∇u, ∆u, ...)df

Z

where g(2), the surface density of the elastic energy, is a quadratic function
of the surface displacement u and its derivatives. We will consider a membrane
with N cylindrical insertions, assuming that on the contour γi of i − th insertion
, the position vector for the points
both u(r) and ∇u(r) are ﬁxed functions of rγi
belonging to γi. It leads to the boundary conditions

= ui(rγi )

∇u(r)|n
rγi

= si(rγi)

”n” designates the direction normal to γi at the point rγi.
Note that the vertical displacement ui in the immediate contact of a mem-
brane with an inserted peptide is typically described by the ”hydrophobic match-
ing condition” [2, 3, 1] leading to a particular case of Eq. 2 with ui(rγi ) = u0 =
const.

Additional conditions on the external membrane boundary (designated as

γ∞) are:

u(r)|γ∞ = 0

∇u(r)|γ∞ = 0

L(u) = 0

The variational principle δF (2) = 0 (the minimum condition for the energy
functional) leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation which we present for now as

where L is a linear diﬀerential operator 1. The elastic energy E = min F (2)[u]
is the value of F (2[u] calculated with the solutions of Eqs. 6-5 in place of u. We
will show now that in some important cases E can be explicitly presented as a
quadratic form of the boundary parameters, such as ui and si.

3 Eﬀective spring constants

3.1 Boundary displacements and contact slopes ﬁxed to

constants

Suppose now that the boundary displacements and the contact slopes are ﬁxed
at the i − th insertion to the constants

ui and si. Some preliminary results for this case were reported in [4]. Eqs.

2, 3 can be written as

We now introduce the ”superﬁnite” elements, φu

i (r), solutions of
Eq. 6 satisfying boundary conditions Eq. 4-5 and following conditions at the
internal boundaries:

i (r) and φs

i (r)|γ k = δik, ∇φu
φu

= 0
1Which means that L · (c1 u1 + c2 u2) = c1 L · u1 + c2 L · u2
(c1 and c2 are the arbitrary constants). The linearity does not impose, however, any restric-
tions on the order of the diﬀerential equation (which for most of the applications considered
is biquadratic).

where δij is the Kronecker symbol.
The solution of Eqs. 6 -5, 7, 8 can be written as a linear combination of the

superﬁnite elements:

Substituting this result into Eq. 1 allows to present E as a quadratic form

of the boundary parameters:

u(r) =

where cαβ

ij are the eﬀective spring constants describing interaction between
the insertions i and j (cαβ
corresponds to the ”self energy”of the i−th inser-
ii
tions). Such a ”linear spring model” was ﬁrst introduced for a single insertion
in [3] and later generalized in [4]. Eq. 12 implies that the additional summation
is performed over the repeated indexes, α, β (= u, s).

The eﬀective spring constants satisfy the symmetry relation

ij = cβα
cαβ

ji and, consequently, cαα

ij = cαα
ji .

For illustration, we consider the expression for g(2) typical in study of mem-

branes:

g(2) = B (∆u)2 + A u2

where A and B are proportional respectively to the membrane stretching
and bending elastic constants and can be dependent on r, but not on u; ∆ =
∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 is the Laplace operator.

Combining Eqs. 11, 14 and 12, we ﬁnd the spring constants:

3.2 Azimuthal variation of the contact slope

3.2.1 General formulas

A possibility that the contact slope can become anisotropic at the contours of
two interacting insertions was studied in [5]. The slope was presented as

si(rγi) = ai + bifi(rγi)

(16)

3

where ai and bi do not depend on r, and fi(rγi ) are the ﬁxed functions. In
practice, functions fi(rγi) approximate the azimuthal variation of the contact
slope. If energy is minimized over the slope parameters ai and bi, then diﬀerent
choices of fi(rγi) result in diﬀerent families of trial functions si(rγi).

The surface displacement u(r) can be expressed now through the boundary

parameters ai, bi and ui.

u(r) =

[uiφu

i (r)+aiφa

i (r)+biφb

i (r)]

The energy is still described by Eq. 12 with the spring constants deﬁned by
Eq. 12; the additional summation is now performed over the repeated indexes

3.2.2 Applications for two insertions

We consider now two identical insertions. Due to possible ﬂuctuations, param-
eters ui, ai and bi, and functions fi(r) for two insertions can still be diﬀerent.
The energy of two insertions is

(19)

where we used the symmetry conditions cαβ

11 = cαβ

22 , cαβ

ij = cαβ

ji = cβα
ij .

We now consider equilibrium setting. This case was discussed in [5]. The
allowed functions fi(r) should satisfy the condition f1(r) = f2(−r), where r = 0
designates the midpoint between the insertions, with boundary parameters for
both channels identical: u1 = u = u, a1 = a2 = a, b1 = b2 = b. Then, the
energy can be presented as

E = Cuuu2 + Caaa2 + Cbbb2 + Cuaua + Cubub + Cabab

(20)

(21)

(22)

(24)

(25)

where

Caβ = (2 − δαβ)(2cαβ

11 + cαβ
12 )

Thus the total number of the eﬀective spring constants is reduced to six. We

intent to study the optimized (”relaxed”, ”equilibrium”) slope, so that

∂E
∂a

= 0,

= 0

∂E
∂b

These conditions lead to

a =

CbbCua − CabCub
∆

u, b =

CaaCub − CabCua
∆

u, ∆ = C2

ab − CaaCbb

(23)

As a result, the total energy minimized over a and b can be written as

Emin = Ku2

K =

Cuu∆ + Cua(CbbCua − CabCub) + Cub(CaaCub − CabCua)
∆

We can see now that six eﬀective spring constants Cαβ deﬁne the equilibrium

slope parameters a and b and the equilibrium energy Emin.

The eﬀective spring constants can be found from the Eq. 15 . Sometimes,
however, it is more practical to use the energy values E[{u, a, b}] deﬁned for
diﬀerent sets {u, a, b} of the boundary parameters.

For every distance d between the insertions, the elastic energy E[{u, a, b}] can
be calculated numerically [1]. Then, all six spring constants can be found. The
following equations illustrate this approach:

Cuu = E[{1, 0, 0}], Caa = E[{0, 1, 0}], Cbb = E[{0, 0, 1}],
Cua = E[{1, 1, 0}] − Cuu − Caa; Cub = E[{1, 0, 1}] − Cuu − Cbb;
Cab = E[{0, 1, 1}] − Caa − Cbb;

With these constants, the equilibrium (or minimized over the slope parameters)
interaction energy proﬁle Emin(d) can be determined from Eq. 20.

4 Final remarks

It was shown that interaction energy between the insertions can be described
in terms of eﬀective spring constants accounting for the coupling between vari-
ous degrees of freedom introduced through the boundary conditions. After the
spring constants are deﬁned, the equilibrium slope (which can in general become
anisotropic) and corresponding interaction energy can be deﬁned analytically.
This approach is much more eﬃcient than the direct energy minimization used
in [1]. Some applications of this approach will be considered elsewhere.

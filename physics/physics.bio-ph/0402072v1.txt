Abstract

Several experimental studies on diﬀerent ﬁelds as molecular biology, economy, or
sociology have shown that real complex networks are following a power-law distri-
bution like P (k) ≈ k−γ. However, many real networks hold two kind of nodes, being
able to be projected as two embedded networks, e.g. movie-actor collaboration net-
work (actors network and movies network), metabolic pathways (substrate/product
network and enzyme/reaction network). Here we have carried out a study on the
physical properties of this kind of networks, where a line graph transformation is
applied on a power-law distribution. Our results indicate that a power-law distri-
bution as P (k) ≈ k−γ+1 is found for the transformed graph together a peak for
the less connected nodes. In the present paper we show a parametrization of this
behaviour and discuss its possible application on real large networks.

I. INTRODUCTION

Commonly, networks of complex systems were described with the classical random

graph theory of Erd¨os and R´eny [1, 2], where the node distribution peaks strongly around

a maximum K = hki. However, recently the experimental studies have ruled out this ap-

proach. The connectivity of nodes was found to follow a scale-free power-law distribution.

The analysis also showed that physical networks (neural network of worm C.elegans, ﬁlm

actors, power grid) have common features as small path length Lactual ≈ Lrandom but high

clusterization degree Cactual >> Crandom [3], revealing a diﬀerent topology than the clas-

sical approach. The systems with these properties were called ”small-worlds” networks

[4, 5, 6]. Several analysis of experimental data networks, considered as ”small-worlds”,

were presented showing a scale-free power-law distribution P (k) ≈ k−γ(World Wide Web,

power grid data, ﬁlm actors) [7], with γ between 1.0 to 4.0. Concerning the biological

networks, a metabolic network analysis of 43 organisms and protein-protein interaction

network were also done [8, 9], showing same topological features to non-biological net-

works.

This new wealth of data stimulated to develop theoretical approaches to reproduce

such kind of experimental behaviour. One of the most successfull models was proposed

by Barab´asi-Albert [7, 10], which introduced a mean-ﬁeld method to simulate the growth

dynamics of individual nodes in a continuum theory framework. The Barab´asi-Albert

model is based on two main mechanisms; (1) Growth: the network starts with a small

number of nodes (m0), and a new node is added at every time step with (m ≤ m0)

edges that link the new node to (m) diﬀerent nodes. (2) Preferential attachment: the

Barab´asi-Albert model asssumes that the probability Q that a new node will be connected

to node i depends on the connectivity ki of that node Q(ki) = ki/Pj kj. Therefore, after

t time steps, the networks is populated with N = t + m0 nodes and mt edges [7, 10].

Even though recent extensions of this model, with rewiring edges [11] , adding a ﬁtness-

dependent dynamic exponent [12], and with aging features [13, 14] have provided a more

accurate description of the network evolution, generating a large available spectrum of

scaling exponent or cut-oﬀs in the connectivity distribution [12], we will use the original

model for generating our synthetic data. Hence, in the framework of this model, the

aim of our study is to analyse a line graph transformation over a scale-free network, and

comparing our results with real networks. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II

we describe the theoretical model that we use and we explain in detail the mathematical

methods. In Sec. III we present the experimental data of several networks and we compare

with our theoretical predictions. The ﬁnal section summarizes our work.

II. THEORETICAL MODELS

A. Line graph transformation

In the Fig. 1, we consider a graph G and we apply a line graph transformation over

this graph G obtaining graph L(G), i.e. transforming each of k edges present in the graph

2

G with degree k into k new nodes in order to generate a line graph L(G), which is well

known in the graph literature [15]. In the real networks we will see that similar operations

can be done. In some papers the analogy betweeen metabolic network and the collabo-

ration network of mathematicians and ﬁlm actors was also discussed [16], because these

kind of networks can be considered as two complementary representations of nodes, and

links connecting only nodes of diﬀerent representations, being commonly named bipartite

graphs [17]. Such kind of two complementary representations for a metabolic network

was carried out in a previous work [18].

We have developed two models to understand the nature of a line graph transforma-

tion over scale-free network. In the ﬁrst one we solve the discrete equation for a degree

distribution of a transformed graph and in the second one we use the inverted beta dis-

tribution. The main concept underlaying a line graph transformation can be summarized

as follows: As the degree of each transformed node will be roughly around k, the distri-

bution of the line graph L(G) should be k · k−γ = k−γ+1 with degree around k. Therefore,

we can conclude that if we have a G graph with a probability distribution following a

power-law as k−γ, then L(G) will follow a power-law as k−γ+1. A complete and detailed

mathematical explanation can be found in the next subsection. Here we sketch that the

discrete equation can be solved discretely in terms of polygamma functions (in particular

digamma and trigamma).

B. Discrete equation for degree distribution of a transformed graph

We asumme the following: A) degree distribution of an original scale-free network follows

|{v|deg(v) = d}| ∝ d−γ if (d > m0), and |{v|deg(v) = d}| = 0 otherwise. B) edges are

randomly generated under (A). Precisely, deg(u) is independent of deg(v) for each edge

(u, v). Hence, if deg(u) is 1 + d1 and deg(v) is 1 + d2, the transformed node correspond-

ing to edge (u, v) has degree d1 + d2. The following relations hold from (A) and (B):
P rob[deg(v) = 1 + di] ∝ (1 + di)−γ with i=1,2, for a randomly generated edge (u, v),

where d1 + 1, d2 + 1 ≥ m0. Therefore, degree distribution of a transformed node would be
P rob[deg(u,v) = d] ∝ P(1 + d1)−γ+1 · (1 + d2)−γ+1 with the sum constrained by d = d1 + d2,

3

d1 + 1 ≥ m0, and d2 + 1 ≥ m0. This equation can be expressed as:

P rob[deg(u,v) = d] ∝

[x1−γ · (d0 − x)1−γ]

(1)

d−m0

X
x=m0

with d0 = d + 2 and x = 1 + d1. We are also able to sum in a discrete way in terms of

polygamma functions (see next section).

C. Analysis in terms of Polygamma functions

The digamma function is deﬁned as: Ψ(z) = d

dz lnΓ(z) = Γ′(z)

Γ(z) where Γ(z) is an exten-

sion of the factorial to complex and real number and it is analytic everywhere except at

z = 0, −1, −2, −3.... The nth derivate of Ψ is named the Polygamma function, denoted

ψn(z). The notation ψ0(z) is frequently used for the digamma function itself as follows:
ψn(z) = dn
dzn

Γ′(z)
Γ(z) = dn

dzn ψ0(z).

For γ = 2 and γ = 3, we can ﬁnd the following expressions for integer x values:

P rob[d]γ=2 ∝

[ψ0(x + 1) + ψ0(x + 3) − ψ0(m0) − ψ0(m0 + 2)]

where d0 = d + 2 and x = d − m0.

matches the distribution of k−γ+1.

It should be noted that P rob[d]γ=2 ≈ d−1 and P rob[d]γ=3 ≈ d−2 for large d, which

One drawback of the previous approach is that the γ factor is considered as an integer

number which constrains its accurate range of quantitative applicability. Hence, we have

looked for a continuous function in terms of the γ parameter. In that sense, we have found

that the inverted beta distribution B(y) ∝ (y − a)β−1/(1 + y − a)α+β, which is obtained

making the transformation Y = 1−X

X over the beta distribution followed by a translation

y → y − a, ﬁts well our requirements and was also used successfully to reproduce the

data. In addition, it is interesting to note that the distribution shows a power-law tail as

y → ∞: B(y) → y−α−1.

E. Theoretical results

Once the theoretical approaches have been introduced, we generate a scale-free net-

work using the Barab´asi-Albert model [7, 10] and we study the behavior of a line graph

transformation over such a kind of scale-free system. We compare the synthetic data of

the transformed network with the results of the theoretical functions exposed above. In

the Fig. 2a we ﬁnd that a line graph transformed network follows a power-law. This re-

sult worths our attention, and shows us that the scale-free network is invariant under the

transformation stressing the role of the power-law distribution in the nature. In addition,

it is interesting to note that the degree of the exponent of this scale-free is exactly reduced

by 1 unit as it was exposed in the previous paragraph. As a second result, a peak was

found for low connected nodes in the line graph transformed network, indicating that the

power-law is like a tail or asymptotic behaviour of a more general kind of distribution.

In the Fig. 2b we plot the inverted beta distribution and the polygamma function to

compare with the transformed network. We see that the curve reproduce well the peak

of the data for low k degree and also shows a power-law tail for higher k degrees. Both

agreements give us conﬁdence about the fairness of both approaches used to study the

data.

III. EXPERIMENTAL DATA

There are several examples, biological and non-biological networks, which appear to

support our present result. We have tested our issue in the World Wide Web with a

5

size of 325729 nodes representing web pages being connected by links each other. The

data was obtained from the website of Notre-Dame Research Group [20]. We must notice

that we have considered the links as undirectional edges in order to compare with our

theoretical approach.

In that sense the γ values obtained here could be considered as

an average of the γin, γout [21]. The analysed protein-protein interaction network for the

yeast S. Cerevisae contained around 1870 proteins as nodes linked by 2240 bidirectional

interactions [9, 20]. The metabolic network from KEGG [19] contained around 10400

compounds and 4100 enzymes.

In the Figs. (3a, 3b) we show the data for the WWW network and the protein-protein

interaction network. We see that both networks are following a power-law. In the same

ﬁgures, we present our results for the corresponding transformed network. We see that

the scale-free is preserved and the γ parameter is decreased by ≃ 1 unit as we expected.

Following with our analysis of real networks, we analyse now a metabolic pathway

network. The source of the used data is from KEGG database [19], which is one of the

best sites for biochemistry, metabolism, and molecular biology information.

As it is depicted in the Fig. 4, for the metabolic networks exist some cases where not

all the edges associated to the substrates graphs are transformed through the line graph.

The main issue is that we must only transform the same number of edges in the substrate

graph as reactions (or enzymes) exist in the real process. In that case, reactions with

more than one product (or substrates) could distort the distribution P (k) ≃ k−γ+1 of a

exact line graph transformation. The distortion could be larger if there are many of these

cases in a network.

In the Fig. 3c we show the experimental degree distribution of a substrate/product G

graph. In the same ﬁgure, we have plotted the line graph tranformation corresponding to

a reaction/enzymes graph, and we can see that both distributions follow a power-law and

the diﬀerence between their exponents is 1. However, that transformation L(G) has not a

full physical meaning because it will have extra nodes (reactions or enzymes), which may

not hold a real correspondence.

In the Fig. 3d we plot the transformed distribution Lreal(G). We see that both graphs

6

are scale-free networks, but in this case, the diﬀerence between the exponents is smaller

than 1, due to the distortion mention above. We can conclude that, even though reactions

with more than one substrate/product are not present in large quantity in the analyzed

network, their presence is remarkable.

It is interesting to quote a previous work [18], which analysed the distribution of

metabolite connectivities in both substrate and reaction graphs. Although in that paper

they does not mention about a line graph transformation scheme and, consequently, they

does not discuss about the nature of the modiﬁcation of γ factor, they notice that the

distribution degree in the reaction graph does not follow a simple power-law and it appears

to be governed by at least two quantitatively diﬀerent regimes.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have reported on the two complementary representation of a scale-free network

using a line graph transformation, which has proved to be an eﬃcient method to extract

the information contained in the real large networks. The two goals of the present work can

be summarized as follows: We have described the large networks as a two complementary

representations of a scale-free network, where the second one emerges when a line graph

transformation is done over the ﬁrst one. Our second goal is that we have found that the

γ exponent is always one unit less than the γ factor coming from the original network.

We have proved that this diﬀerence of one unit is invariant and holds an universal nature,

as it is seen experimentally in the biological and non-biological networks analysed. We

have also made a theoretical study of the general distribution underlying the line graph

transformation, being successfully to reproduce the peak found for low connectivities of

nodes. However, we should bear in mind that for some real networks an ordinary line graph

transformation can not hold a physical meaning, and instead of that we must transform

only a predeﬁned number of edges. This fact makes that the transformation is distorted in

terms of the diﬀerence between γ factors. The goals exposed here represent an interesting

step forward to understanding the large complex networks from this complementary scale-

free perspective.

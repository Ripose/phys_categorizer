We study the statistical mechanics of RNA secondary structures designed to have an attraction
between two diﬀerent types of structures as a model system for heteropolymer aggregation. The
competition between the branching entropy of the secondary structure and the energy gained by
pairing drives the RNA to undergo a ‘temperature independent’ second order phase transition from
a molten to an aggregated phase. The aggregated phase thus obtained has a macroscopically large
number of contacts between diﬀerent RNAs. The partition function scaling exponent for this phase
is θ ≈ 1/2 and the crossover exponent of the phase transition is ν ≈ 5/3.

RNA secondary structures are an excellent model sys-
tem to study the folding phenomenon in heteropolymers.
Unlike the protein folding problem where a large num-
ber of diﬀerent monomers are needed to be taken into
account to understand folding [1], an RNA has just four
bases A, U, C and G. The interaction schemes are simpler
due to the separable energy scales of the secondary and
the tertiary structure. These features, which result in an
algorithm to calculate the partition function of folding in
polynomial time [2], make the RNA secondary structures
a both analytically and numerically amenable model to
study various thermodynamic properties of heteropoly-
mer folding [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

The thermodynamic phases of such secondary struc-
tures generally depend on the temperature and the
monomer speciﬁc binding free energies (which could in
turn depend on the temperature themselves). At low
enough temperatures, where the monomer speciﬁc bind-
ing energies and the sequence heterogeneity are impor-
tant, the resulting (frozen) phase is glassy [4, 6]. At high
temperatures, the large thermal ﬂuctuations lead to an
unbound denatured phase, where the secondary structure
is randomly coiled (without any binding) analogous to a
self avoiding random walk. At temperatures in between,
where an eﬀective attraction between short segments is
important, the molecules are expected be in the so called
molten phase [5, 6]. The molten phase corresponds to
a large number of diﬀerent secondary structures all hav-
ing comparable energies (within O(kBT )) coexisting in
the conﬁguration space. Another important phase of the
secondary structure is the native phase, which is a cer-
tain speciﬁc folded structure favored by evolution [5, 8].
Many important questions have been raised with regard
to these phases, e.g. their stability, characteristics and
the phase transitions in the context of both protein fold-
ing and RNA folding [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In this Letter we
shall try to understand another important aspect of het-
eropolymers, the misfolding leading to aggregation, using
the RNA secondary structure formulation.

The function of a biological molecule such as a pro-
tein or an RNA is dependent on how a given sequence of
monomers folds. The failure of protein molecules to fold
correctly is believed to be associated with various diseases
such as Alzheimer’s, Mad Cow and Parkinson’s [9, 10].
The importance of this phenomenon has led to various
studies in Protein misfolding and aggregation in various
contexts [10, 11]. Here, we consider a toy model to study
the phase transition of an RNA secondary structure from
the molten to a suitably deﬁned aggregated phase. Our
focus here is on the thermodynamic properties of the sys-
tem. Thus, we solve the model exactly in the thermody-
namic limit and calculate the critical exponents relevant
to the phase transition.

≤

i < j

RNA is a biopolymer with four diﬀerent monomers A,
U, C and G in its sequence. The Watson-Crick pairs
A-U and C-G are energetically the most favorable pairs
while G-U is marginally stable and the other combi-
nations are prohibited. By an RNA secondary struc-
ture, we mean a sequence of binding pairs (i, j) with
1
N , where N is the number of bases in
the sequence. Any two pairs (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) are ei-
ther nested, i.e. i1 < i2 < j2 < j1 or are independent i.e.
i1 < j1 < i2 < j2. The above restriction means we are
not allowing pseudo-knots, which are generally energet-
ically not as favorable [12]. Such a secondary structure
can be represented abstractly by a helix diagram, non-
crossing arch diagram or a mountain representation as
shown in Fig. 1.

≤

Let the free energy associated with the pairing of bases
i and j in an RNA be ǫij. This free energy would have
contributions from the gain in the energy due to binding
and the associated conﬁgurational entropy loss. In addi-
tion to these, in principle there are also entropic and/or
energetic eﬀects due to loop formation, stacking, etc.
Even though the accurate parameters as determined by
the experiments are essential to calculate the exact sec-
ondary structure, such microscopic details as well as the
exact values of the energies ǫij do not aﬀect the asymp-
totic properties of the phases and the critical exponents.
Hence, we ignore them in our model calculations.

If we denote the partition function for a sequence of
bases from i to j as Zij, it can be evaluated exactly using

2

Here, the intra RNA base pairing energies ǫ1 and ǫ2 could
be of comparable magnitude in a realistic RNA molecule.
The inter RNA base pairing energy, or the bias, ǫ3 is
the parameter which can in principle be controlled by
sequence mutation. Note that in the spirit of the molten
phase [5], the base as we call it here could be understood
as a short segment consisting of several bases.

Denote the Boltzmann factors corresponding to the
pairing energies by q1, q2 and q3 respectively. We show
that this simple model predicts a molten to an aggregated
phase transition, as we tune the parameter q3.

−

To keep the analytical calculations simple, we assume
each RNA to be of equal length, containing N
1 bases
[14]. We now consider the joint folding of these two RNAs
and denote its partition function by Zd(N ; q1, q2, q3). As
explained before, the free energy of pairing for the bases
belonging to a given RNA has contributions from the
energy gain due to the pairing and the entropy loss as-
sociated with the loop formation. This holds true even
for pairing across the bases belonging to diﬀerent RNAs.
But when the ﬁrst pairing between the bases belonging to
diﬀerent RNAs occur, there is an additional entropic loss
due to the breakdown of translational invariance sym-
metry. Thereafter, only the free energy ǫ3 plays a role in
the inter RNA base pairing. In the thermodynamic limit,
this additional entropic loss has no eﬀect on the phase of
the system, but it is the energetics of pairing that drives
the phase transition. Hence, we ignore this additional
entropic term. This essentially reduces the problem to
the folding of a single sequence with 2N
2 bases. The
aggregated secondary structure can now be interpreted
as having a macroscopically large number of contacts be-
tween the two halves of the concatenated RNA.

−

Let us ﬁrst consider two special cases. Setting q = q1 =
q2 = q3 corresponds to the well known molten phase of
the RNA secondary structure, whose partition function
can be calculated exactly in the asymptotic form

Zd(N ; q, q, q) = Z0(2N ; q) = A(q)(2N )−θzc(q)2N (3)

with the characteristic scaling exponent θ = 3/2 [5]. This
exponent is characteristic in the sense that it is insensi-
tive to various microscopic details of the RNA secondary
structure such as the cost of a hairpin loop, weak se-
quence disorder and heterogeneity, etc. The other simple
case is q3 = 0. This case corresponds to having two
RNAs in the molten phase which do not know of each
other’s presence. The partition function of such a dual
RNA would then be just the product of individual parti-
Z0(N, q1)Z0(N, q2).
tion functions, i.e. Zd(N ; q1, q2, 0)
≡
Hence the scaling exponent is θ = 3.

We now want to understand the case of general q1,
q2 and q3. To this end we calculate the partition func-
tion of the dual RNA as follows. Let the base pairings
within a given RNA be called primary and those across
diﬀerent RNAs be called secondary. Any given secondary
structure thus obtained has a series of secondary pairings
1 and
(i1,j1),. . . ,(ik,jk) such that 1

the RNA. The dashed arches correspond to the base pairs.
The absence of pseudo-knots implies that the arches never

always returns to the baseline at the end.

To understand the phase transition from the molten
to the aggregated phase, we ﬁrst deﬁne the aggregated
phase as an ensemble of RNA secondary structures in
which a macroscopically large number of contacts occur
between two diﬀerent RNAs. We consider a dual RNA
biomolecule system consisting of two types of RNA in a
solution. We refer to them as RNA-1 and RNA-2. In-
dividually, RNA-1 and RNA-2 are in the molten phase.
However, when they are together in a solution, there is
an eﬀective attraction between the bases belonging to
diﬀerent RNAs. We study the phases of this dual RNA
system, as the bias strength is varied.

To do so, we assume a simple pairing energy model
with the free energy of pairing between bases i and j
deﬁned as:

The results are shown in Fig. 2. For q3 = q3c = √q1q2,
we ﬁnd a square root singularity and hence θ = 3/2 [15],
the characteristic exponent of the molten phase. For
q3 > q3c, ˆZd has an inverse square root singularity, in-
dicating a new phase. We interpret the new phase with
the partition function scaling exponent θ
1/2 as the

aggregated phase. For q3 >
q3c, its hard to extract the

singularity, but our claim that it remains the aggregated
phase is veriﬁed by the numerical calculations shown be-
low. Similarly, we claim that for all q3 < q3c, the dual
RNA system is just the phase corresponding q3 = 0 in
the asymptotic limit, hence θ = 3. This claim is again

In order to verify that the phase transition indeed
happens at q3c = √q1q2, we calculate the order pa-
rameter of the phase transition. Here, the order pa-
rameter Q is deﬁned as the fraction of secondary pair-
ings in a secondary structure. For arbitrary q3 the
order parameter can be calculated exactly from Q =
limN→∞(d ln Zd/d ln q3)/N . The inset of Fig. 4 clearly

with q3 thereafter saturating to Q = 1 for q3/q3c ≫
From this behavior of the order parameter we can con-
clude that the phase transition indeed occurs at q3c =
√q1q2 and that the phase transition is of second order.
Physically, we can understand the behavior of the order
parameter by using the mountain representation of RNA
(see Fig. 1c). Between any two consecutive secondary
pairings, the contribution of primary pairs to the height
of the mountain is zero. Hence, the total number of sec-
ondary pairings is equal to the height

O(N 1/2), hence Q
we ﬁnd that
q3 < q3c, the secondary pairings are even less likely, and
hence in the thermodynamic limit Q = 0 for q3

consistent with what we have obtained by exact expres-
sion.

To further verify our claims about the phase for q3 <
q3c and to calculate the scaling exponents correspond-
ing to the second order phase transition, we iterated the
recursion relation (Eq.(1)) to calculate the exact par-
tition function for RNA of ﬁnite length N . The re-
sults of the numerical calculations are in complete agree-
ment with the phase diagram of Fig. 3 when extrap-
olated to the thermodynamic limit, thus verifying our
claim. Next we calculate the free energy per length
ln Zd(N )/N , taking into account the ﬁ-

for the order parameter Q(N ) = N −1/2g[(q3

ing plot, with the best ﬁt value for the crossover critical

To do so, we performed numerical simulations of two
selected sequences.
In the ﬁrst case, we take (ACU )n
and (AGU )n as our two RNA sequences. We assume
ǫCG = 2 ǫAU =
2 T and ǫGU = 0 which is approximately
true at the temperature 37 ◦C. If we consider ACU and
AGU as short segments of our coarse graining approxima-
tion, we observe that there is a relatively larger eﬀective
attraction towards the segment of the other RNA. As ex-
pected, our numerical simulations does indeed show an
aggregated phase, i.e θ
1/2, in the asymptotic limit.
The phase corresponding to θ = 3 is observed in de-
signed sequences such as (AU )n and (CG)n as RNA-1
and RNA-2 respectively.

This model has some similarities with Go-like model
studied by Bundschuh and Hwa [5] which shows a molten-
native transition. The physics behind the phase transi-

4

tion in their model as well as our model is the same,
i.e., the competition between the energetic gain of the
secondary contacts (or native contacts of Go-like model)
and the branching entropy. But, contrary to the native
phase where the ground state is unique, the aggregated
phase has degenerate ground states. On the other hand,
both these models can ‘melt’ from their (aggregated or
native) ground state to any of the molten, glassy or de-
natured phase, depending on the temperature and the
strength of the bias. The diﬀerences in the behavior of
these models arises from the fact that for the Go-like
model the bias is site speciﬁc where as for the model
we have presented, the bias is towards a macroscopically
large number of sites.

In summary, we have presented a simple model for het-
eropolymer folding using the RNA secondary structure
formulation, which shows a second order phase transi-
tion from an independently molten to an aggregated phase.
The behavior exactly at the criticality turns out to be the
molten phase for the concatenated molecule. The transi-
tion is completely driven by the energetics of pairing and
is temperature independent. For the case where the free
energy of pairing is temperature dependent, our model
would imply that at a given temperature, when the av-
erage attraction between pairs of diﬀerent molecules ex-
ceeds a certain threshold, the aggregation would occur.
Proteins are known to undergo a folding transition from
native to an aggregated phase instead of from a molten
to an aggregated phase [10]. It should be interesting to
see if this study can be extended to understand the ther-
modynamics of such a phase transition. It should also be
interesting to study the role of kinetics of RNA folding
in this phase transition.

Instabilities in the transient response of muscle

Andrej Vilfan∗ and Thomas Duke
Cavendish Laboratory, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0HE, UK†

(Dated: 20. March 2003)

We investigate the isometric transient response of muscle using a quantitative stochastic model
of the actomyosin cycle based on the swinging lever-arm hypothesis. We ﬁrst consider a single
pair of ﬁlaments, and show that when values of parameters such as the lever-arm displacement
and the crossbridge elasticity are chosen to provide eﬀective energy transduction, the T2 curve
(the tension recovered immediately after a step displacement) displays a region of negative slope.
If ﬁlament compliance and the discrete nature of the binding sites are taken into account, the
negative slope is diminished, but not eliminated. This implies that there is an instability in the
dynamics of individual half-sarcomeres. However, when the symmetric nature of whole sarcom-
eres is taken into account, ﬁlament rearrangement becomes important during the transient: as
tension is recovered, some half-sarcomeres lengthen while others shorten. This leads to a ﬂat T2
curve, as observed experimentally. In addition, we investigate the isotonic transient response and
show that for a range of parameter values the model displays damped oscillations, as recently
observed in experiments on single muscle ﬁbers. We conclude that it is essential to consider the
collective dynamics of many sarcomeres, rather than the dynamics of a single pair of ﬁlaments,
when interpreting the transient response of muscle.

I. INTRODUCTION

The transient response of muscle to a sudden ad-
justment of its extension, or to an abrupt change in
load, has been one of the most important sources of
information about the mechanism of contraction for
over three decades. Ever since the pioneering work of
Huxley and Simmons (1971), experimental data on tran-
sients has informed theoretical models of the interac-
tion between myosin and actin (Chen and Brenner, 1993;
Eisenberg et al., 1980; Hill, 1974; Huxley and Simmons,
1971; Huxley, 2000), providing a more detailed picture
than could be obtained from the force-velocity relation
(Hill, 1939; Huxley, 1957) alone. The reason is that the
actomyosin interaction involves several processes which
occur on diﬀerent time scales, and these individual com-
ponents can be resolved during the transient response
(Brenner, 1991; Brenner et al., 1995; Ford et al., 1977,
1985, 1986; Huxley and Simmons, 1971). The quickest
process is the elastic deformation of the myosin cross-
bridges that link the thick and thin ﬁlaments. Rapid
transitions between two or more diﬀerent bound states
of the myosin molecule are thought to be the next fastest
events, while detachment and reattachment of myosin
heads occur on a slower time scale.

In an experiment to determine the isometric transient
response, a muscle ﬁber is held at both ends to pre-
vent it from contracting. The muscle is then suddenly
shortened (or stretched) by a ﬁxed amount, and the ten-
sion T that it generates is measured. Immediately after
the imposed change of length, the tension shifts from

the isometric value T0 to a new value, which is termed
T1. But shortly afterwards (typically within 2 ms), the
Subse-
tension adjusts to a new value, termed T2.
quently,
it gradually reverts to the original isometric
value T0, and the entire transient response is usually com-
pleted in a fraction of a second. It is generally accepted
that the initial response T1 corresponds to the mechan-
ical deformation of cross-bridges and provides a direct
measure of their elasticity (Huxley and Simmons, 1971).
The interpretation of T2 is rather more controversial.
It is often attributed to force generation by the work-
ing stroke of bound myosin molecules (Brenner et al.,
1995; Duke, 1999, 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1980; Hill,
1974; Huxley and Simmons, 1971; Huxley and Tideswell,
1996) and this interpretation has recently gained sup-
port from X-ray interference techniques applied to short-
ening ﬁbers (Irving et al., 2000; Piazzesi et al., 2002a).
But alternative models suggest that the force regener-
ation might be due,
in part, to the rapid binding of
new myosin heads to the thin ﬁlament (Brenner, 1991;
Howard, 2001), or that it might involve the activation of
the second myosin head (Huxley and Tideswell, 1997).

In this article, we wish to address a fundamental prob-
lem connected with the interpretation of force transients.
The present theories are all based on the consideration
of a single pair of ﬁlaments, i.e. one ﬁlament containing
myosin molecules, interacting with one actin ﬁlament.
The dynamics of this ﬁlament pair is generalized to that
of a whole muscle ﬁber by assuming that all ﬁlament
pairs in a ﬁber behave in exactly the same way. This
assumption is certainly justiﬁed as long as there are no
static or dynamic instabilities in the system. However,
the possibility of such instabilities has been known for
a long time (Hill, 1974). Moreover, a stochastic model
of the actomyosin cycle, based on the swinging lever-arm
hypothesis, has shown that instabilities do arise when val-

ues of parameters such as the lever-arm displacement and
the crossbridge elasticity are chosen to provide eﬀective
energy transduction (Duke, 1999, 2000). Such instabili-
ties would give rise to a region of negative slope in the T2
curve of a single ﬁlament pair. Several reasons have been
advanced for the absence of any negative slope in the ex-
perimentally determined T2 curve. Huxley and Simmons
(1971) argued that the power stroke is sub-divided into
several small steps, and ﬁxed the step size so that the
T2 curve had zero slope for limitingly small changes of
length. In the model proposed by Eisenberg et al. (1980),
the ﬂatness of the T2 curve was explained by a broad dis-
tribution of cross-bridge strain after attachment, com-
bined with a speciﬁc strain-dependence of the transi-
tion rates to ensure the proper occupancies of the two
bound states. A further explanation involved the com-
pliance of the ﬁlaments and the distribution of binding
sites on the thin ﬁlament in addition to a sub-divided
power stroke (Huxley and Tideswell, 1996). Duke (1999)
has suggested that the ﬂat T2 curve of a muscle ﬁber can
arise despite an instability in the dynamics of a single
pair of ﬁlaments, owing to the symmetry of a sarcomere.
We investigate this possibility further in this article.

II. METHODS

Simulation of the stochastic evolution of the system
was performed using the Gillespie kinetic Monte Carlo
algorithm, which works as follows.
In each simulation
step the rates of all possible transitions are calculated.
The time until the next event is chosen as a random num-
ber with an exponential distribution and the expectation
value given by the inverse of the sum of all rates. The
event itself is chosen randomly with a statistical weight
proportional to its rate. In the situations with stiﬀ (non-
compliant) ﬁlaments and continuous binding sites the
transition rates can be factorized into factors that depend
only on the backbone position (which are the same for all
motors in a group) and factors that only depend on the
binding position of a motor (which does not change with
time unless that motor undergoes a transition). This al-
lowed us to use a very eﬃcient (n log n) algorithm based
on binary trees.

i.e.

We assumed complete mechanical relaxation of the
system in each step,
the strain of all elastic el-
ements is equilibrated before the next transition takes
place. The structure involving sarcomeres, ﬁlaments and
myosin heads was described as a circuit of elements with
given resting lengths and compliances. The strain of ev-
ery cross-bridge was calculated, given the constraint of
ﬁxed total length of the system (isometric conditions),
or of ﬁxed force acting on the ends of the system (iso-
tonic conditions).

The T2 transients were always determined 2 ms after
the stretch/release. All other parameter values are sum-
marized in Table I.

III. MOTORS ACTING BETWEEN A SINGLE PAIR OF
FILAMENTS

A. Isometric transient in a swinging lever-arm model

We model the chemical cycle of a myosin head as de-
scribed in Refs. (Duke, 1999, 2000) and shown in Fig. 1.
A molecule can exist in either a detached state (D) or
in one of the attached states, A1 (with ADP·Pi) or A2
(with ADP). The state A1 is also referred to as the weak-
binding state (Brenner, 1991). The chemical transition
between states A1 and A2 is concomittant with a con-
formational change of the molecule, in which the lever
arm moves through displacement d. From state A2 the
head undergoes another conformational change with a
lever-arm shift δ, associated with ADP release. In the
ATP-rich physiological environment, this step is quickly
followed by detachment of the head and we therefore skip
the transitional state (A3) in our model. The attach-
ment and detachment rates, which are summarized in
Table I, determine the shape of the force-velocity rela-
tion, but have little inﬂuence on the transient response
to length steps, which mainly depend on the power-stroke
displacement d and the elastic constant K of the myosin
cross-bridge. We assume that the transitions A1↔A2
take place on a faster time scale than the detachment
and reattachment of heads. Therefore, once a head has
bound with strain ξ in the state A1, its state can be de-
scribed as a statistical ensemble of the states A1 and A2
with probabilities given by the Boltzmann factors

where ∆Gstroke is the free energy change associated with

Now consider a ﬁlament containing N myosin motors
interacting with a actin ﬁlament which is held to prevent
it from sliding. If NA heads are bound to the actin with
a distribution of strains Φ(ξ) (normalized to 1), then the
isometric force that they generate is

As a ﬁrst approximation, we can neglect the distribu-

(6)

which provide a measure of the energy stored in the
elastic element when the head performs a power stroke
(A1→A2). The parmeter ǫ0 measures this energy rela-
tive to the thermal energy, while ǫ1 compares it to the
magnitude of the chemical free-energy change ∆Gstroke
that accompanies the power-stroke transition. Note that
if ǫ1 < 1, the power stroke can occur immediately af-
ter the myosin head binds to the thin ﬁlament; but
if ǫ1 > 1, the conformational change is energetically
inhibited initially, and it is only likely to occur once

the thin ﬁlament has been moved forward by the ac-
tion of other motors. On grounds of eﬃciency of en-
ergy transduction, we expect the value of ǫ1 to be as
high as possible, while ensuring that there is suﬃcient
chemical energy to drive the power stroke, i.e. ǫ1 ≈ 1
(Duke, 1999). The power-stroke displacement d has been
measured directly in a number of single-molecule exper-
iments, and the values obtained range between 5 and
10 nm (reviewed by Tyska and Warshaw, 2002). Data
on the crossbridge elasticity K are less reliable, because
there are inevitably other sources of compliance in the
system (Veigel et al., 1998). But indirect evidence is pro-
vided by the energetic eﬃciency of muscle, which peaks
at about 50 % (Barclay, 1998; Kushmerick and Davies,
1969; Piazzesi et al., 2002b). Thus a lower estimate for
the energy stored in the elastic element following the
power stroke is one half of the free-energy change accom-
panying the hydrolysis of an ATP molecule ∆GATP ≈
20 kBT, which leads to ǫ0 & 10. Taking into account that
not all energy stored in the spring can be converted to
mechanical work one obtains a better estimate ǫ0 ≈ 20
(Duke, 1999) (which is consistent with ǫ1 ≈ 1 if most
of the energy of hydolysis is used to power the stroke
∆Gstroke ≈ ∆GATP). This corresponds to an elastic
constant K = 2.5 pN/nm if a power-stroke distance of
d = 8 nm is assumed.

The form of the T2 curve depends critically on the

values of these dimensionless parameters.

If ǫ0 > 2, an interval with a negative slope (a hystere-
sis) exists (Hill, 1974). This means that under isotonic
(constant load) conditions the system can be bistable.
The location of the interval of negative slope depends on

ent values of the parameter ǫ1. The dotted and the dashed-
dotted lines shows the response of a group of motors which

With a value of ǫ1 ≈ 1 the T2 curve always has a neg-
ative slope around the stationary point. For example,
with ǫ0 = 20, Eq. (7) yields 0.85 < ǫ1 < 1.22. However,
it should be bourne in mind that this calculation does
not take into account the distribution of strains on cross-
bridges within the ensemble, and so the actual range
might deviate slightly from this estimate.

An example of the T2 transient for a group of myosin
heads between two ﬁrmly clamped ﬁlaments is shown in
Fig. 2.

B. Group of stiﬄy coupled motors under near-isometric
conditions

For a single pair of ﬁlaments, true isometric conditions
imply that both ﬁlaments are held ﬁxed. However, ex-
perimental conditions are usually near-isometric, in that
the average velocity is zero, but the ﬁlaments still have

4

the freedom to move. This situation occurs, for exam-
ple, if both ﬁlaments are held at their ends by a ﬂexible
spring (in which case the motors cause the ﬁlaments to
slide until the stall force is reached), or if the ﬁlaments
suﬀer a constant load which is precisely adjusted to pre-
vent net sliding. In this case the conditions are actually
isotonic (or nearly so) and the instability discussed in the
previous section implies that there is no steady state of
the system with zero velocity when Eq. (7) is satisﬁed.
Instead, as shown in Fig. 3, the pair of ﬁlaments oscil-
lates in near-isometric conditions. The mechanism that
generates the oscillations is the following. An ensemble of
bound motors pulling against a constant load has two sta-
ble conﬁgurations: one with a majority of motors in state
A2, the other with the majority in state A1. Because the
detachment of motors is faster from state A2 than from
state A1, the total number of bound motors decreases
when the system is in the ﬁrst conﬁguration. As a result,
the load per motor increases until the remaining motors
cannot support the load any more, whereupon the sys-
tem ﬂips into the second conﬁguration. Subsequently, the
number of bound motors starts to grow again, and when
the load per motor falls below a critical level the system
ﬂips back to the ﬁrst conﬁguration. Repetition of the cy-
cle gives rise to an oscillation whose asymmetry reﬂects
the diﬀerences in attachment and detachment rates.

Could the isometric transient be modiﬁed if it is mea-
sured in near-isometric conditions,
instead of exactly
isometric conditions? Fig. 2 shows the average T2 re-
sponse in the situation where the ﬁlaments are held at
the ends by an external spring.
In the non-oscillating
case (ǫ1 = 1.33, dashed line) the diﬀerence between this
T2 curve and the one in the strictly isometric state is only
quantitative. The most important result is that the range
of negative slope in T2 remains. On the other hand, in the
oscillating case (ǫ1 = 0.8, dot-dashed line) the negative
slope is ﬂattened out because of the broader distribution
of strains on cross-bridges.

C. Eﬀect of ﬁlament elasticity

The compliance of the thick and thin ﬁlaments is also
expected to aﬀect the T2 curves. We model it by intro-
ducing a linear elasticity in the backbone connecting the
heads (which is, to ﬁrst order, equivalent to an elasticity
in the track the motors are running on) (Vilfan et al.,
1998). With γ being the linear modulus of the ﬁla-
ments, which has the measured value γ = 44000 pN
(Kojima et al., 1994), the spring constant of a ﬁlament
segment of length L is Kf = L−1γ.
In (Vilfan et al.,
1998) a linear two-state model was used to study the
eﬀect of ﬁlament elasticity on force-velocity relations,
showing that they reduce the isometric force if the com-
pliance of a ﬁlament segment between two bound mo-
tors becomes comparable to the motor spring constant
K. Thin ﬁlaments are just stiﬀ enough to prevent sig-
niﬁcant losses due to this eﬀect. However, the ﬁlament

FIG. 3 A) A group of motors pulling against a spring. The curve shows the spring extension y as a function of time t. When
the motors reach stall the average velocity is zero, but fast oscillations occur on the length scale of the power-stroke. The
observed oscillations are characteristic of the case where the criterion in Eq. (7) is fulﬁlled. The simulation involved 300 motors
pulling on an elastic element with spring constant Kext = 10 pN/nm, with other parameters equal those of the dashed line in
Fig. 2. B,C) The mechanism of oscillations: (1) When the majority of bound motors are in state A2, the average detachment
rate is higher than the attachment rate, which leads to a fall in the number of attached motors (2). The force per bound
motor, shown in (B), therefore increases. When the upper limit of the hysteresis is reached, the system abruptly jumps to the
other ﬁxed point in which most bound motors are in the state A1 (3). Because the detachment rate is low in the state A1,
the number of bound motors increases again (4) whereby the average force per bound motor drops. This eventually leads to a
transition back to the ﬁxed point in which most motors are in state A2 (1), at which point the oscillation cycle repeats.

compliance can have a signiﬁcantly bigger eﬀect on the
transient response. The result of a simulation is shown in
Fig. 4. Although the ﬁlament compliance almost halves
the total stiﬀness of the system, it leaves the major part
of the interval of negative slope unaﬀected.

D. Eﬀect of discrete binding sites

So far we have assumed that a myosin head can bind
anywhere on the actin ﬁlament with equal probabil-
ity. However, in reality the binding sites on actin are
c = 5.5 nm apart.
In addition, the actin ﬁlament has
a helical structure with a half-pitch of about 38 nm (7
monomers). We therefore propose that the binding rate
to a particular site is proportional to the Boltzmann fac-
tor determined by the spring distortion energy, composed

These curves have been measured experimentally using
S1 myosin heads by Steﬀen et al. (2001) and the data
were ﬁtted with KA = 15 pN/nm, the value which we
use here. The position-dependence of the binding rate
for these parameters is shown in Fig. 5. A similar dis-
tribution has also measured for myosin V (Veigel et al.,
2002).

Huxley and Tideswell (1996), both the ﬁlament compli-
ance and the discrete binding sites contribute to the ﬂat-
tening of the T2 curve. However, our simulation indicates
that their combined eﬀect is not suﬃcient to cancel the
negative slope with the parameters used here. We there-

single-ﬁlament model, but requires taking into account
the action of serially connected sarcomeres.

IV. MOTORS IN MUSCLE SARCOMERES

A. Redistribution of ﬁlaments

The situation changes essentially if we take into ac-
count that the experiments are performed on whole mus-
cle ﬁbers, where several hundreds of sarcomeres are con-
nected in series, as shown in Fig. 6d. The tension in each
half-sarcomere must be the same, but the extension of
each half-sarcomere can diﬀer, provided that their sum
equals the total stretch of the muscle ﬁber. To see what
happens in this situation, it is instructive ﬁrst to look at
a minimum unit consisting of two ﬁlament pairs, joined
back-to-back as shown in Fig. 6b. This unit represents
two thin ﬁlaments and a thick ﬁlament, the basic build-
ing block of a sarcomere. A sudden stretch of the unit
will ﬁrst displace both halves equally, according to the
elasticity of cross-bridges. But in the next phase, when
the distribution of states A1 and A2 equilibrates, the
position of the thick ﬁlament can become unstable. This
means that a slight ﬂuctuation in one direction will cause
the motors pulling the thick ﬁlament in that direction to
increase their force and those on the other side to de-
crease it, and the thick ﬁlament will jump sideways to
one of the stable points. A schematic example is shown
in Fig. 7.

FIG. 7 The force-displacement relations of the left and the
right half of a myosin ﬁlament before (A) and after (B) a
length step. The sum of their displacements must equal the
total sarcomere stretch, ∆x1 + ∆x2 = 2∆x. This condition
is imposed by plotting the force-displacement-relation of one
set of motors as a function of ∆x1 (x-axis) and that of the
other set as a function of ∆x2 = 2∆x − ∆x1 (upper x-axis).
The forces on the myosin ﬁlament are in equilibrium if the
forces produced on both sides (T2(∆x1) and T2(∆x2)) are
equal, which is given by the intersection of both curves. The
equilibrium is stable if the ﬁrst curve crosses the second from
below and unstable if it crosses it from above. If there are
three stationary points (B), the central one is always unsta-
ble and those to either side stable. The force-displacement
relation of the two-ﬁlament unit is given by the force at the
stable intersection as a function of the mean displacement ∆x.

FIG. 8 The T2 response of a single actin-myosin ﬁlament pair,
compared with 2, 4, 8, and 16 ﬁlament pairs in series. Each
myosin ﬁlament contains 300 heads.

The result of a simulation using diﬀerent numbers of ﬁl-
ament pairs, connected in series (the situation illustrated
in Fig. 6c), is shown in Fig. 8. The interval of negative
slope is increasingly ﬂattened out as the number of pairs
increases. Apart from the cancellation of the hysteresis, a
shift in the curves is also observable, corresponding to the
transition between the strictly isometric conditions and
those where a ﬁlament is held under isotonic conditions
before the stretch, cf. Fig. 2. The eﬀect of redistribution
can best be seen if one plots the distribution of stretches
of individual half-sarcomeres against the total stretch per
half-sarcomere (Fig. 9). For large stretch amplitudes the
distribution is concentrated on the diagonal, in agree-
ment with the expectation that all ﬁlaments experience
the same stretch. For two ﬁlament pairs in series, the dis-
tribution splits in the intermediate range. The two peaks
represent two stretches for which the single-ﬁlament T2
curves produce the same force. Their position is deter-
mined by the condition that the average stretch must
equal the value on the x-axis. With four ﬁlament pairs
in series, a similar situation occurs, but with three diﬀer-
ent regimes. First three out of four pairs get displaced in
one direction while the fourth is displaced in the other di-
rection. Then this ratio changes to two against two and
ﬁnally to one against three, before the regime with all
ﬁlaments being subject to the same displacement settles
in. With higher numbers of ﬁlaments in series (Fig. 9c
shows the situation for 32) this pattern becomes increas-
ingly continuous. In the regime where the negative slope
stretches over the isometric point, the individual ﬁla-
ments perform small oscillations (Fig. 3) while the whole
muscle is held at a constant length. These oscillations
blur the distribution further (Fig. 9d).

T2 curves for four diﬀerent values of K are shown in

taining N = 300 motors.
(D) shows a simulation with 32
ﬁlament pairs and ǫ1 = 0.8, in which spontaneous oscillations
of individual ﬁlaments take place, thereby blurring the indi-
vidual shifts.

B. Isometric state

It is instructive to take a closer look at the parameters
of the globally isometric state (by globally we mean that
the total length of a ﬁber composed of many sarcom-
eres is constant, rather than the positions of individual
ﬁlaments) in the two cases: one where the individual ﬁl-
aments oscillate and one where their positions just ﬂuc-
tuate. All data were determined in a situation where
a large number (32 in the simulation) of ﬁlament pairs
were connected in series and the total length held con-
stant (situation (c) in Fig. 6). One expects the oscillating
ﬁlaments to consume more ATP than the non-oscillating
ﬁlaments. The results are summarized in Table II. An
exact comparison with experimental data is diﬃcult, be-
cause the fraction of attached heads in the isometric state
is not known reliably, and also because the experiments
were carried out at diﬀerent temperatures and with dif-
ferent types of myosin. For example, the value measured
by Barsotti and Ferenczi (1988), 0.4 ATP molecules per
second per head (with 25% of the heads attached this
gives 1.6 s−1 per attached head), is compatible with the
ﬁrst scenario. However, other measurements give higher
values (Ebus and Stienen, 1996), more consistent with
the second case. We therefore conclude that from the
experimental values of the ATPase rate in the isometric
state neither scenario can be excluded.

At high values of ǫ1, the model shows an interesting

feature.
In the isometric state the number of cross-
bridges in the state A2 can be very low, although the
generated force per attached cross-bridge is as high as
5 pN, in agreement with single-ﬁlament measurements
(Kawai et al., 2000). This allows the muscle to support
a load under isometric conditions with little ATP con-
It might at ﬁrst sound para-
sumption (Duke, 2000).
doxical that most of the isometric force is generated by
the pre-power-stroke state A1. This is possible because
the myosin heads bind with a stochastic distribution of
strains. Because those with a negative strain are more
likely to undergo the power-stroke and then detach, the
remaining ensemble produces a positive force. In this as-
pect, the power-stroke actually serves to eliminate nega-
tively strained cross-bridges rather than direct generation
of positive force. This notion is in agreement with recent
experiments, which have shown that high phosphate con-
centration does reduce the isometric force signiﬁcantly
(Cooke and Pate, 1985), but it does not have a visible

eﬀect on the conformation of the myosin heads or even
their catalytic domains (Baker et al., 1999). But let us
stress again that this holds only for the isometric state.
The force in a contracting muscle originates mainly from
the state A2.

C. Isotonic response

Another important class of experiments which provides
information on the actomyosin interation involves the iso-
tonic transient. Here the applied force is initially set
at the value of the stalling load T0, so that the ﬁber
is prevented from contracting. The force is then sud-
denly changed and held constant at a diﬀerent value,
while the length of the ﬁber is recorded. Some early ex-
periments showed that following a small step change of
load, damped oscillations were imposed on the steady
contraction or extension of the ﬁber (Granzier et al.,
1990; Podolsky, 1960). Such oscillations are particu-
larly clear in recent experiments on single muscle ﬁbers
(Edman and Curtin, 2001).

One possible cause of this oscillatory response has pre-
viously been suggested on the basis of the stochastic
model of the actomyosin interaction used in this arti-
cle. When ǫ1 > 1, the chemical cycles of myosin motors
on the same ﬁlament can become synchronized at loads
close to the stalling force (Duke, 1999, 2000). A pair of
ﬁlaments then slides in a step-wise fashion under isotonic
conditions. But during steady shortening, the motors on
diﬀerent ﬁlaments within the same muscle ﬁber operate
out of phase, so that there is no macroscopic manifesta-
tion of the steps. However, an abrupt change in the load
can cause the synchronization of a large fraction of the
bound motors, whereupon the steps do become observ-
able (Duke, 1999). Because the correlation of the motors
soon decays, the macroscopic steps fade and a damped
oscillation is seen.

A much stronger oscillatory response is seen in the
regime where individual pairs of ﬁlaments perform os-
cillations in the near-isometric state, as described in
Sect. III.B. The synchronized oscillations can then be
very pronounced following a small decrease in the load,
as shown in Fig. 11a. On the other hand, no damped os-
cillations are observed after a larger drop in the load, e.g.
to T0/3 (Fig. 11b), because the individual ﬁlament pairs
immediately move out of the hysteretic regime. These
properties are in agreement with recent experiments on
the isotonic response of single muscle ﬁbers carried out
by Edman and Curtin (2001).

In steady isotonic conditions, another kind of insta-
bility can arise due to a hysteresis in the force-velocity
relationship. The possibility of such an instability was
ﬁrst discussed in the context of a two-state ratchet model
(J¨ulicher and Prost, 1995) and subsequently in a kinetic
cross-bridge model with a strain-dependent detachment
rate (Vilfan et al., 1999). With the parameters we use
this hysteresis, though existent, covers a rather small

the load, when the initial value of the load is chosen precisely
to stall the contraction. The upper graph shows the force

displays the length change per half-sarcomere and the num-
ber of attached myosin heads per myosin ﬁlament, which is a
measure of the ﬁber stiﬀness. The data were computed with
N = 300, ǫ1 = 0.8 and with 50 myosin ﬁlaments acting in par-
allel. The results were averaged over 125 events (which has
the same eﬀect as simulating that number of sarcomeres in se-
ries). A small drop in the load synchronizes the cross-bridges
and therefore causes observable macroscopic oscillations (A).
The oscillations are less pronounced, but still visible following
a small increase in the load (C).

V. DISCUSSION

In the past, the isometric transient model of muscle
has been modelled by considering the dynamics of a sin-
gle pair of ﬁlaments. A signiﬁcant problem with this
approach is that, with a general choice of parameters
in a cross-bridge model, the T 2 curve is not ﬂat (Hill,
1974) — it typically has either a positive or a negative
slope for limitingly small step displacements. Thus, in
order to reproduce the experimental T 2 curve of mus-
cle, some of the parameters have needed to be ﬁnely
adjusted (Eisenberg et al., 1980; Huxley and Simmons,
1971), and limitations have been imposed on the size
d of the power-stroke and the rigidity K of the cross-
bridges (Huxley and Tideswell, 1996). In this article we
have investigated the isometric transient response using
a stochastic model of the actomyosin cycle. When values
of the parameters d and K are chosen to explain other
characteristics of muscle, like the force-velocity relation
and the eﬃciency of energy transduction, the T2 curve
of a single pair of ﬁlaments displays a region of negative
slope, which cannot be eliminated by factors including
ﬁlament compliance and the discrete nature of the bind-
ing sites on the actin ﬁlament. However, we argue that
the symmetric structure of sarcomeres must be taken into
consideration when computing the isometric transient re-
sponse of muscle. Following a step change of length of a
muscle ﬁber, a redistribution of sarcomere lengths occurs
within the ﬁber. Some half-sarcomeres contract, while
others extend. This redistribution always eliminates the
negative slope, leading to a ﬂat T2 curve. It is a generic
feature of unstable elements connected in series, and does
not require any special values of model parameters.

Our model shows that there are two diﬀerent regimes
of the microscopic dynamics in near-isometric conditions.
For a range of values of the parameter ǫ1 close to unity,
the isometric point falls in the interval where the slope of
the T2 curve is negative. In this case individual ﬁlament
pairs oscillate with small amplitude. In the other regime,
where the T2 curve has positive slope at the isomet-
ric point, the individual ﬁlaments are stationary, apart
from stochastic ﬂuctuations. The macroscopic manifesta-
tions of these two regimes diﬀer in few respects. Because
the oscillations of diﬀerent ﬁlament pairs have diﬀerent
phases, oscillatory motion is not normally observable on
the scale of a whole muscle ﬁber in steady conditions.
However, a sudden change of load can synchronize the os-
cillations and thereby make them visible. The existence
of damped oscillations in the isotonic transient response
of single muscle ﬁbers (Edman and Curtin, 2001) there-
fore argues in favor of the oscillating regime. We note,
however, that damped oscillations can also be a manifes-
tation of step-wise shortening (Duke, 1999), which can
exist in both regimes. Because the eﬃcient transduction

10

of energy demands ǫ1 ≈ 1, which is close to value of
this parameter at the boundary of the two regimes, it is
possible that both regimes exist depending on conditions
such as the myosin isoform, phosphate concentration, pH,
ionic strength and temperature. Indeed, measurements
by Edman and Curtin (2001) show a dependence of the
oscillation decay on the solution pH and on muscle fa-
tigue. Further experiments, in which conditions are sys-
tematically varied, could shed more light on the mecha-
nism of oscillation.

As a ﬁnal remark, we emphasize that according to our
model, the T2 curve of an individual pair of ﬁlaments
diﬀers from that of a muscle ﬁber. Recently, assays have
been developed to measure the force-velocity relation of
a single ﬁlament within a half-sarcomere (Kawai et al.,
2000). In order to test our predictions, it would worth-
while to develop such high-precision techniques to mea-
sure the transient response of a single ﬁlament.

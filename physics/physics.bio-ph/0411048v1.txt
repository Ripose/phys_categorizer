Abstract. Model of biological eﬀects of ionizing particles, especially of protons and
other ions, is proposed. The model is based on distinguishing the single-particle and
collective eﬀects of the underlying radiobiological mechanism. The probabilities of
individual particles to form severe damages to DNA, their synergetic or saturation
combinations, and the eﬀect of cellular repair system are taken into account. The
model enables to describe linear, parabolic and more complex curves,
including
those exhibiting low-dose hypersensitivity phenomena, in a systematic way. Global
shape as well as detailed structure of survival curves might be represented, which is
crucial if diﬀerent fractionation schemes in radiotherapy should be assessed precisely.
Experimental cell-survival data for inactivation of V79 cells by low-energy protons have
been analyzed and corresponding detailed characteristics of the inactivation mechanism
have been derived for this case.

1. Introduction

Models estimating the fraction of surviving cells are of utmost importance for
applications of ionizing radiation in radiotherapy, because both tumor control and
normal tissue complication probabilities (TCP, NTCP) are given primarily by cell

survival in the corresponding regions.
irradiating by accelerated protons and light ions, the biological eﬀects are not given
by applied dose only, but depend signiﬁcantly on other physical characteristics of these
particles. Their relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) has been shown to vary hugely
with ion kind and energy or LET value; see, e.g., (Belli et al 1998, 2000, Folkard et al
1996, Weyrather et al 1999).

Several phenomenological model approaches aimed at estimating the fraction of
surviving cells have been proposed so far for treatment planning procedures, based e.g.
on a similarity in LET characteristics between carbon and neutron beams (Kanai et al
1999) or using the linear-quadratic (LQ) formalism with its α and β coeﬃcients
depending on LET and ion kind (Belli et al 1997). A systematic model approach has
been represented by the local eﬀect model (LEM) of Scholz and Kraft (Scholz and Kraft
1994, 1995, Scholz et al 1997, Kraft et al 1999), in which the diﬀerences in biological
eﬀects of diverse ions have been related to their track structures. However, in any of
these approaches the underlying physically-chemical and especially biological processes
have not been addressed in detail. A realistic model scheme (”the probabilistic two-
stage model”) based on probabilistic description of the main processes involved in the
corresponding radiobiological mechanism will be presented in this paper.

The probabilistic two-stage model is based, in principle, on distinguishing the single-

particle and collective eﬀects of the radiobiological mechanism:
energy transfer, subsequent chemical reactions and also formation of DNA damages
occur practically independently after the impacts of individual ionizing particles, at
least at dose levels and dose rates that are used commonly in radiotherapy. On the
other hand, the ﬁnal response of a given cell, which includes biological processes that
start from DNA repair and lead ﬁnally to cell survival or inactivation, has to be classiﬁed
as a response to the total eﬀect of all traversing particles.

In the case of protons and other ions, the amount of energy deposited in a cell
nucleus by a single particle (including all secondary particles) is much higher than
in the case of irradiating by photon or electron beams. The number of particles that
contribute to a given dose level is lower, and the severity of damages formed by individual
particles increases signiﬁcantly. Even though it is still the collective eﬀect of all the
damages that leads to cell inactivation, the role of single-particle eﬀects is much more
important than in the case of photon irradiation. Even the impact of a single particle
may result in inactivating the cell; compare e.g. (Miller et al 1999). Model scheme that
enables to represent the eﬀects of single particles as well as their synergetic or saturation
combinations is very helpful in such a case.

The basic idea of distinguishing the single-particle and collective eﬀects in the

Probabilistic two-stage model of cell inactivation by ionizing particles

case of proton and light ion irradiation has been formulated by Judas and Lokaj´ıˇcek
(2001), who also suggested that survival curves should be represented by higher-order
polynomials instead of their simple parabolic description by the LQ model. Further
analyses of the model framework have demonstrated that the polynomial expansion can
be used reliably in the low-dose region only. The model has been reformulated in order
to ensure its applicability to survival curves measured over a wide range of doses; it
has been also developed to greater detail (Kundr´at 2004). Applications of the model to
analyses of experimental data have shown the possibility to describe a large variety of
experimental cell survival curves. In comparison to phenomenological models, the two-
stage model has enabled to represent systematically not only the global shape of cell
survival curves but also their detailed structure. The importance of this feature of the
model arises from the fact that even small deviations of cell survival curves from their
global parabolic or linear shape might be largely ampliﬁed in the case of fractionated
irradiation.

2. Probabilistic two-stage model

2.1. Basic model framework

Within the probabilistic two-stage model of biological eﬀects of ionizing particles, the
following characteristics of the underlying radiobiological mechanism are taken into
account: (i) the actual number of primary particles depositing energy to the cell nucleus,
(ii) the amount of energy deposited (including, for the sake of simplicity, the energy
delivered by all secondary particles), and (iii) the resulting probability of cell inactivation
which reﬂects the complexity of the DNA damage produced.

2.1.1. Number of traversing particles. The numbers of particles traversing nuclei of
individual cells of the irradiated tissue or sample are of stochastic nature. Their average
number, kav, is given by particle ﬂuence Φ or applied dose D,

kav = hD .

Here, h denotes
the proportionality constant, which reﬂects also geometrical
characteristics of the given cell line and irradiation arrangement. The distribution of
traversing particle numbers over the cell population can be described then by Poisson
statistics,

Pk(D) =

exp(−hD) .

(hD)k
k!

Here we have assumed that the impacts of individual particles can be considered as fully
random, and that the diameters of the most eﬃcient track parts are by far smaller than
the size of cell nucleus, which is in agreement with the results of track structure studies
(Holley et al 1990).

2.1.2. Energy transferred to cell nucleus. The amount of energy transferred to cell
nucleus (or, more speciﬁcally, to chromosomal system and sensitive regions within it)
together with the spatial distribution of individual energy transfer events play key roles
with respect to the complexity of the resulting DNA damage. This is in turn crucial
for the future fate of the given cell. The amount of energy transferred to chromosomal
system by each primary particle (including all its secondaries) is a stochastic quantity.
It is inﬂuenced by energy and energy-loss spectra of beam particles.
It may be, in
principle, estimated on the basis of theoretical predictions, Monte Carlo calculations
or microdosimetry measurements. Let us denote by π1(ε) the spectrum of energy ε
deposited to cell chromosomal system in one event (one traversal, i.e. one primary
particle plus all its secondaries). The normalization condition reads

εmax

Z
0

dε π1(ε) = 1 ,

where εmax stands for the maximum energy that may be transferred in one event. The
spectrum of energy transferred in k events is given, then, by a corresponding convolution

2.1.3. Cell survival probability. The number of events (traversals of primary particles),
k, and the total amount of transferred energy, ε, stand for the primary characteristics
describing processes of the physical phase of the radiobiological mechanism. The
subsequent chemical and biological processes include large cascades of chemical reactions
that lead to the formation of DNA damage, DNA repair processes, and further
processes of the biological response of the cell that result ﬁnally either in its survival
or inactivation. As far as cell survival is concerned, these complex processes can be
taken into account in a simpliﬁed way by representing the ﬁnal endpoints directly, i.e.
by considering only the ﬁnal probabilities of cell inactivation. In the following we shall
denote by p(i)
k (ε) the average cell inactivation probability after the impact of k (primary)
particles that have deposited energy ε. Note that a similar approach, based e.g. on DSB-
induction probabilities, might be used if other eﬀects, e.g. the yields of DNA damage,
were the endpoints of interest. Probability of cell survival (i.e., cell survival curve) is,
then, given by

where the distribution of the actual number of particle traversals, k, and also the
spectra of transferred energy, πk(ε), have been taken into account. Here the dose
dependence is included in Pk(D), see Eq. (2). Note that the average number of
traversing particles per unit dose, h, as well as transferred energy spectra, πk(ε), and
also inactivation probabilities p(i)
k (ε) vary signiﬁcantly for diﬀerent particles, their LET
values and/or diverse cell lines. This is in agreement with the experimental evidence of
the dependence of cell survival on all these factors. Given the inactivation probabilities
p(i)
k (ε) together with the distribution of particle numbers Pk and the spectra of
transferred energy πk(ε) under the given experimental or clinical irradiation conditions,
one would be able to calculate the cell survival probability according to Eq. (6).
Using corresponding model approaches (Webb and Nahum 1993, Niemierko et al 1992,
Niemierko and Goitein 1993), macroscopic endpoints such as the tumor control and
normal tissue complication probabilities (TCP and NTCP) can be estimated, then. In
evaluating the cell survival probability according to Eq. (6), a crucial role is played by
the inactivation probabilities p(i)
k . These probabilities reﬂect the biological eﬀectiveness
of diﬀerent radiation modalities. They may be interpreted directly in terms of physical
and biological processes. They represent, therefore, a solid basis for establishing more
detailed microscopic models of radiobiological mechanism. Methods of evaluating these
probabilities on the basis of analyzing corresponding experimental cell-survival data will
be derived and discussed in the next sections.

2.2. Monoenergetic ions

Radiobiological experiments aimed at establishing the biological eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent
radiation kinds are performed usually by irradiating cell monolayers by monoenergetic
beams only. The beam energy is chosen so as to correspond to certain regions in the
Bragg peak of the given particles (so-called track-segment experiments).
In such a
case the spectrum of transferred energy is rather narrow, at least as compared to non-
monoenergetic beams. The (average) energy transferred to cell nuclei is proportional to
the LET value λ of the particles. Moreover, in this case the average number of (primary)
particles traversing cell nuclei, i.e. the parameter h (cf. Eqs. (1) and (2)), can be related
to the eﬀective cross-section, σ, of the cell nucleus (or chromosomal system) and LET
value λ by

h =

Cσ
λ

.

(7)

Approximating the density of traversed medium by that of water, the conversion
constant C = 6.24 keV Gy−1 µm−3 for the usual choice of units (λ[keV/µm], D[Gy],
σ[µm2]). Note that σ denotes the geometrical eﬀective cross-section of the chromosomal
system (or of sensitive region within cell nucleus) to be traversed by the given particles.
The consequent processes of DNA damage and cellular response are not involved in
σ, but treated separately. Note especially that σ is not identical to cell inactivation
cross-section, which is used by some authors to describe (the linear component of) the

Probabilistic two-stage model of cell inactivation by ionizing particles

probability, per 1 particle, of the cell to be inactivated; compare e.g. (Scholz and Kraft
1994).

Cell survival probability can be, then, expressed as

2.3. Detailed model of inactivation probabilities

In the case of particles characterized by higher LET values, i.e. protons, neutrons and
ions, even the impact of a single primary particle (including the eﬀects of all its secondary
particles) may produce a severe damage to chromosomal DNA, which might ﬁnally lead
to cell inactivation.
In the following, we shall refer to these damages as to ”single-
particle induced” damages. Let us denote the probability of their induction, per one
If k particles have traversed the chromosomal system, the
traversing particle, by a.
probability of not being damaged in this way is given by

k = (1 − a)k .
qA
e

A vast majority of DNA damages formed by traversing particles are not of this
severity; they can be repaired successfully and do not lead to cell inactivation. However,
DNA damages caused by diﬀerent particles might combine to form a kind of damage
that is diﬃcult to be repaired. Synergetic combinations of such damages might include
combinations of single-strand breaks (SSBs) into a double-strand break (DSB) or DSBs
into a more complex damage. They need not be limited to one chromosome only; e.g. the
impact of a particle pair damaging corresponding segments of chromosomes of a given
homologous pair. To account for these combined eﬀects, let us denote by b the average
probability that such a severe damage, which alone does not result in inactivating the
cell, has been formed by a single particle. If this is the only damage to the cell, we shall
assume that it can be repaired quite easily and the cell will survive, possibly with some
delay in its proliferation cycle. However, combination of two or more such damages
might lead to cell inactivation if not repaired correctly. Probability that no such ”pair”
or ”combined” damage‡ has been formed after the impact of k particles is then, to the
ﬁrst approximation, given by

k = (1 − b2)k(k−1)/2 .
qB
e

Here we have assumed, for the sake of simplicity, that the synergetic eﬀects occur
predominantly from particle pairs only; the exponent in the last formula stands just
for the number of particle pairs.

‡ Note that also the probability of inducing ”pair damage” to DNA refers to the eﬀect of a single
particle. The term ”pair” or ”combined” damage has been chosen just to highlight the lower severity of
such damage, i.e. the necessity of being combined with another damage of a similar character in order
to lead to cell inactivation.

The ﬁnal biological eﬀect, measured e.g. by means of cell survival, does not depend
only on the initial yield of DNA damages. Cellular repair processes have been shown to
contribute signiﬁcantly to this point, too. In the following we shall assume that severe
DNA damages potentially leading to cell inactivation, either caused by single particles
(”single-particle induced” damages) or combined from multi-particle eﬀects (”combined”
or ”pair” damages), may be repaired by the cell. We shall denote the probabilities of
repairing them successfully by rA and rB. After the cellular repair processes took place,
the probability that a residual severe damage is present equals, then,

in the case of combined (or ”pair”) damages, respectively. Here we have explicitly
indicated that the rate and ﬁdelity of repair processes in the two cases need not be
equal. The damage complexity increases with the number of traversing particles k and
with the LET value λ. Therefore, the probability of successful repair of DNA damages
should decrease with these factors. The repair probability might, however, in some cases
exhibit more complex behavior, corresponding to the onset of cellular repair processes.
The probabilities that the mentioned damages have either not been formed at all

or have been repaired faithfully are just the complements of the last terms,

respectively.
If the cell should survive, it must not be inactivated by either of the
mentioned mechanisms; i.e., neither single-particle induced nor pair damages must be
present after the repair processes took place. The cell survival probability is, therefore,
given by

qk = qA

k qB

k ,

and the inactivation probability
p(i)
k = 1 − qk .

The cell survival probability s(D) after applied dose D is given then by Eq. (8),
where the distribution of the numbers of particles traversing individual cell nuclei is
given by Poisson distribution, Eq. (2).
In the case of Bragg peak or other non-
monoenergetic irradiation, the spectra of transferred energy have to be taken into
account, too, according to Eq. (6). Similarly, in the case of mixed beam irradiation
one has to convolve these results with the spectrum of traversing particles (i.e. with the
abundances of individual ion species in the beam), again in the way analogous to that
indicated in Eq. (6).

k and rB

The probabilities of ”single-particle” and ”pair” damage formation, a and b, as well
as of successful repair, rA
k , depend signiﬁcantly on the radiation quality (ion
kind and LET value) and, of course, on the biological characteristics of given cell line
(cellular radiosensitivity, cell cycle phase etc.). The values of these parameters may be
established by analyzing corresponding experimental data. Systematic sets of data, in
which cell survival has been assessed for a given ion at diﬀerent energies (diﬀerent LET
values), might be used to evaluate even the functional dependence of these probabilities
on particles’ LET values. Corresponding analyses have been performed by us for various

of the damage induction and repair probabilities, more detailed microscopic models,
representing the underlying chemical and biological processes, might be helpful, too. In
fact, the given model scheme represents a framework enabling one to relate the outputs
of those microscopic models to cell survival characteristics, which might be assessed
experimentally in a direct way.

The probability of successful repair, r, should reﬂect the complexity of the total
damage formed by all the traversing particles. The damage complexity might be, to
the ﬁrst approximation, estimated from the total amount of energy deposited to cell
nucleus (or chromosomal system). For the sake of simplicity, we have therefore limited
ourselves to consider the repair probability, r(k, λ), to be a function of the transferred
energy only, ε ∼ k.λ:

r(k, λ) → r(k.λ) .

2.4. Basic model features

Let us discuss the basic features of the given model framework, especially the role
of individual model parameters in determining the shapes of cell survival curves.
Obviously, there are no diﬃculties in describing simple linear or parabolic cell survival
curves by the given model scheme. Linear curves (Fig. 1) can be represented by taking
into account the terms including pA
k only, i.e. by assuming that all the lesions formed
by the traversing particles are lethal, do not need to be combined with damages caused
by other particles (i.e. b = 0), and cannot be repaired by the cell (r = 0). This
is in agreement with experimental evidence: Linear survival curves have been found
especially in very sensitive cell lines and in cell lines that have been proved to be
deﬁcient in repair (Joiner 1997). Linear response has been observed also in irradiating
by very high-LET particles, where the severity of DNA damages is assumed to be very
high (Kraft et al 1997). Similarly, survival curves characterized by a global parabolic
shape can be represented by taking into account the terms including pB
k ; compare Fig. 2.
Even cell lines exhibiting DNA repair of a certain level may be characterized by roughly
parabolic survival curves; compare Fig. 3.

Cell survival curves may, however, exhibit more complex behavior. The given model
scheme can be used to represent survival curves showing, e.g., a downward bending in
the region of lower doses followed by an upward bending at higher doses, compare

arbitrary in these examples; it corresponds to the choice of h value.

Fig. 4. The corresponding repair probability, to which such complex behavior has to be
attributed, is shown, too.

The model enables one to describe also survival curves exhibiting the low-dose
hypersensitivity phenomenon, which has been observed for many cell lines irradiated
by diﬀerent particles (Joiner et al 2001, Chalmers et al 2004, Schettino et al 2001).
In Fig. 5 two examples of calculated survival curves with hypersensitivity regions are
demonstrated. The corresponding repair characteristics, showing an onset (triggering)
eﬀect, are displayed, too. Note that if the repair proﬁle exhibits signiﬁcant variations in
the rather narrow range of a few particles traversing the nucleus, the corresponding
survival curve may be characterized even by a temporary increase in the medium-
dose region (Fig. 6). Such behavior has been found in several experiments, compare
e.g. (Chalmers et al 2004).

The examples shown in this section demonstrate clearly that in determining the

3. Application to experimental data

The proposed model has been applied to analysis of experimental cell survival data for
Chinese hamster V79 cells after irradiation by low-energy protons, which was assessed

Probabilistic two-stage model of cell inactivation by ionizing particles

12

experimentally by Belli et al
(1998). Mono-energetic proton beams were used in their
study, with the energies in the range of 0.57 – 5 MeV, corresponding to LET values
7.7 – 37.8 keV/µm.

Flexible monotonous test functions were used in b(λ) and rB(k, λ), whereas a(λ) has
been allowed to possess a non-monotonous behavior.

Model calculations of the survival curves (full lines) together with experimental data
(points) are shown in Fig. 7. For comparison, ﬁts of the data according to the linear-
quadratic (LQ) model are displayed, too. Probabilities of forming ”single-particle” and
”pair” DNA damages discussed in the preceding are shown in Fig. 8. Single-particle
induced damages, a, have turned out to play a minor role only. Consequently, it has
been possible to neglect their repair, i.e. to put rA(k, λ) ≡ 0, which has simpliﬁed the
ﬁtting procedure. The derived probability of successful repair of the ”pair damages” as
a function of traversing particle numbers k and LET values λ is plotted in Fig. 8.

The optimization procedure used in the present analysis has been based on
applying standard minimization methods; mainly the SIMPLEX and MIGRAD methods
implemented in the MINUIT minimization tool (James 1994) have been applied to
dedicated computer codes written in the programming language FORTRAN. The
goodness of ﬁt has been assessed by calculating the χ2 values (Hagiwara et al 2002)
for individual survival curves. They have been calculated as a sum of the deviations
of (logarithms of) model calculations, smodel, from the data, sexp, weighted by the
experimental errors, ∆i, of individual data points (again in the logarithmic scale),

χ2 =

(ln smodel − ln sexp)2

The values of χ2 for individual survival curves represented by the probabilistic two-stage
(P2S) model and by the linear-quadratic (LQ) model are listed in Table 1. The total
χ2 values were 24.0 for the P2S model and 45.0 for the LQ model, respectively. The
corresponding values of auxiliary parameters involved in Eqs. (17) are listed in Table 2.
These values correspond to the eﬀective cross-section of V79 nucleus (or chromosomal
system) σ = 12.8 µm2; the goodness of ﬁt of the model to the data has varied only
slightly around this value.

4. Discusion

Basic characteristics of DNA damage formation and of cellular repair processes have
been derived in the studied case. The corresponding probabilities have been determined
by analyzing experimental cell survival data only; no other inputs or assumptions have
been used. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with experimental studies concerning
the yields of DNA damage; compare e.g. (Prise et al 1998).

The results have shown that for protons in the studied range of rather high LET, the
pair damages dominate over the single-particle ones. In the local-eﬀect model (LEM), for
example, combined eﬀects are not taken into account at all, as all damages are assumed
to be of lethal nature. This seems to be the reason why discrepancies of the order
of 25% have been found between the given experimental data and the corresponding
calculations based on the LEM scheme; compare (Belli et al 1998, Scholz and Kraft
1995). The diﬀerences in inactivation mechanism between protons and heavier ions,
identiﬁed on the basis of the given detailed model scheme, will be discussed in detail in
a forthcoming paper (Kundr´at et al 2004).

The formation of lethal damages by individual particles (single-particle induced
damages) gets saturated for protons at LET values around 30 keV/µm. This means

Probabilistic two-stage model of cell inactivation by ionizing particles

15

that for protons the RBE eﬀects related to overkill occur already on the level of
damage induction probability, which has a maximum at values much lower than unity
(around 20% in the present analysis). The probability of inducing combined damages,
on the other hand, possesses a monotonous increase over the whole studied LET
range. The repair probability exhibits decreasing behavior with increasing LET and/or
particle numbers, corresponding to increasing complexity of the total damage induced
in chromosomal DNA.

The eﬀective cross-section of cell nuclei has been established in the present analysis
on a phenomenological basis only. It has been limited from below by the given data,
as by assuming a too low value of the cross section the cell survival probability would
be too high as compared to the given data. Upper limit on the eﬀective cross section
has been represented by the average geometrical cross-section of cell nuclei of the given
cell line σgeom = 134 keV/µm reported in the given experiment (Belli et al 1998). The
eﬀective cross-section (i.e., the cross-section of the sensitive region within the nucleus
with respect to proton tracks) has corresponded to approximately 10% of the nucleus.
In the future, attempts will be made to relate the damage induction and repair
probabilities to the results of track structure studies and other microscopic models of
physical and biological processes. These models might be helpful in determining the
eﬀective cross section of the cell nuclei with respect to a given ion (and its energy), too.
The present analyses rely on the fact that the most eﬃcient parts of proton tracks are
much narrower than the dimensions of cell nuclei, which has enabled to apply Poisson
statistics.

As to the precision of representing experimental cell-survival data, the present
calculations and those based on the LQ model yield similar results for lower-LET
protons, where the experimental survival curves possess quite simple shapes. They
diﬀer signiﬁcantly in the highest LET values (compare Fig. 7) corresponding to proton
track ends, where detailed structure of the data can be represented only by the detailed
scheme of the probabilistic two-stage model.

The required level of accuracy inﬂuences the number of auxiliary parameters that
have to be involved in the parameterization of DNA damage induction and repair
If e.g. in treatment planning applications a less precise representation

of survival curves is suﬃcient,
less detailed parameterization e.g. of the form of
f (x) = exp(−(αx)β) might be used for b(λ) and rB(k, λ) instead of those of Eqs. (17).
This diﬀerence in parameterization is of technical nature only, the basic scheme of the
model remaining the same.

5. Conclusion

The probabilistic two-stage model provides a realistic description of the radiobiological
mechanism.
It includes description of DNA damages of diﬀerent severity caused by
individual traversing particles, as well as of their synergetic and saturation combinations.
Basic characteristic of repair processes are incorporated, too. The model might serve as

Probabilistic two-stage model of cell inactivation by ionizing particles

16

a basis for more detailed microscopic modeling of radiobiological eﬀects.

As demonstrated explicitly for the case of low-energy protons, the probabilistic
two-stage model enables to represent experimental cell survival curves with much
better precision than the LQ model, while the total number of parameters involved
is about the same. The ability of representing cell survival precisely is a prerequisite
if diﬀerent fractionation schemes of hadron radiotherapy are to be evaluated, because
in fractionated irradiation the local variations (i.e. local deviations of the cell survival
ratio from the global shape of survival curve) may get largely ampliﬁed in the cumulative
eﬀect of the given scheme. The model enables to represent simple linear and parabolic,
but also rather complex survival curves, including e.g. the low-dose hypersensitivity
phenomenon, where a kind of triggering behavior of repair probability has to be taken
into account. Unconventional fractionation schemes including hyperfractionation might
be assessed on this model basis, too.

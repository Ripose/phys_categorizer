Running Title: Protein-Induced Phospholipid Redistribution

Keywords: theory, double-layer interaction, protein–membrane interactions, MARCKS, PIP2

ABSTRACT

We studied the adsorption of a charged protein onto an oppositely charged membrane, com-
posed of mobile phospholipids of diﬀering valence, using a statistical-thermodynamical ap-
proach. A two-block model was employed, one block corresponding to the protein-aﬀected
region on the membrane, referred to as the adsorption domain, and the other to the unaf-
fected remainder of the membrane. We calculated the protein-induced lipid rearrangement
in the adsorption domain as arising from the interplay between the electrostatic interactions
in the system and the mixing entropy of the lipids. Equating the electrochemical potentials
of the lipids in the two blocks yields an expression for the relations among the various lipid
fractions in the adsorption domain, indicating a sensitive (exponential) dependence on lipid
valence. This expression is a result of the two-block picture but does not depend on further
details of the protein–membrane interaction. We subsequently calculated the lipid fractions
themselves using the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We examined the dependence of lipid en-
richment, i.e., the ratio between the lipid fractions inside and outside the adsorption domain,
on various parameters such as ionic strength and lipid valence. Maximum enrichment was

INTRODUCTION

Some membrane-associated proteins are known to bind to membranes non-speciﬁcally through
electrostatic interactions (Murray et al., 1997; Resh et al., 1999; McLaughlin et al., 2002;
Murray et al., 2002). These interactions result from the attraction between a cluster of
charged residues in the protein and the oppositely charged membrane lipids. At a distance,
the two objects feel the attraction coming from their average charge densities, which is
partially screened by the ionic solution, without an appreciable change in the membrane
properties. When the charged protein approaches the membrane, it changes the local mem-
brane charge in its vicinity. We refer to this protein-aﬀected region on the membrane as the
adsorption domain. The lateral ﬂuidity of the membrane allows oppositely charged lipids
to migrate toward the adsorption domain in order to minimize the interaction free energy.
Evidence for such redistribution was reported in experimental (Heimburg et al., 1999; Rauch
et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002) and theoretical (May et al., 2000; Fleck et al., 2002; May et
al., 2002) studies.

Local changes in lipid concentration may have biological signiﬁcance. For example, PIP2,
a polyvalent phospholipid with valence in the range
5 (Toner et al., 1988; McLaugh-
lin et al., 2002; Rauch et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002) participates in signal transduction
(Czech, 2000; Payrastre et al., 2001; Simonsen et al., 2001). Its average fraction in plasma
membranes is very low, about 1%, and it is known to be concentrated in speciﬁc regions
of the membrane (Liu et al., 1998; Stauﬀer et al., 1998). The PIP2 lipid serves as a sub-
strate for Phospholipase C (PLC), which cleaves it to two secondary messengers (Katan and
Williams, 1997). Another component, the Myristoylated Alanine-rich C Kinase Substrate
protein (MARCKS), containing an amino acid segment of 13 basic and no acidic residues
(Blackshear, 1993; McLaughlin and Aderem 1995), is believed to form a PIP2 ‘reservoir’ in
its adsorption domain. As long as PIP2 is concentrated in the MARCKS adsorption domain,
PLC is inhibited and cannot catalyze the PIP2 hydrolysis (Wang et al., 2001). It is assumed
that upon demand, by phosphorylating the MARCKS eﬀector segment, these lipids are freed
for signalling (McLaughlin et al., 2002). Thus the capability of MARCKS to sequester PIP2
potentially aﬀects intracellular signalling.

Lipids of various valences are attracted to the adsorption domain to diﬀerent extents.
This electrostatically-induced enrichment is partially balanced by entropy eﬀects that favor
homogeneous lipid distribution. Theoretical studies of bilayers composed of neutral and
monovalent lipids, where the lipid mobility was taken into account, showed that the forma-
tion of a charged lipid domain due to the adsorbed protein is energetically favorable and
outweighs entropy eﬀects (e.g., Heimburg et al., 1999; May et al., 2000). Recently, Fleck et
al. (2002) presented a detailed formulation for the interactions between charged objects and
a membrane composed of lipids of various valences. These studies demonstrate the important
role of lipid redistribution in the thermodynamics of protein–membrane adsorption.

Based on the ﬁndings of these theoretical studies, we focus in this work on a simpliﬁed
model for the redistribution of diﬀerent-valence lipids in the adsorption domain of a charged
protein. We start by deriving an expression that relates the fractions of the various lipids in
the adsorption domain to their values in the unperturbed membrane. The general expression
is restricted, however, to relations between concentrations of diﬀerent lipids. To obtain the
actual concentration values for each lipid type, we use the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory
(e.g., Andelman, 1995).

The model is then applied to peptide segments, such as a polylysine chain, interacting

Figure 1: Schematic view of the protein–membrane system. The protein region interacting with the
membrane is modeled as a planar surface of charge density σp, hovering parallel to the membrane at a
distance h. The unperturbed membrane is composed of various lipids, each having valence zi and a mole
fraction of φi. The interaction region on the membrane, the adsorption domain, has area A and lipid
fractions ψi. The whole system is embedded in an ionic solution characterized by a dielectric constant ǫ,

with a membrane composed of uncharged, monovalent, and trivalent lipids, corresponding to
zwiterionic PC, PS, and PIP2, respectively. Finally, the model is evaluated and the biological
implications of its results are discussed.

MODEL

A schematic view of the protein–membrane system under study is provided in Fig. 1. In
the model, the membrane is considered to be an inﬁnite surface composed of k phospholipid
species. Each phospholipid type i is ascribed a fraction (in the unperturbed membrane) φi
and a ﬁxed valence zi. (We do not consider pH-dependent dissociation of charged lipids,
which was found to have a minor eﬀect compared to lipid mobility; Fleck et al., 2002.) The
indices i = 0 and i = 1 are assigned to neutral lipids (z0 = 0) and monovalent anionic ones
(z1 =
1), respectively, which are always present in biological membranes. For simplicity,
all phospholipids are ascribed the same headgroup area a. (In a more detailed model, one
can treat diﬀerent headgroup areas; Andelman et al., 1994.)

−

≫

We assume that the adsorption domain is a “patch” of ﬁnite area A and uniform charge
density σm, whose size is much larger than the Debye screening length of the solution κ−1, i.e.,
κ2A
1. The screening provided by the surrounding ionic solution ensures a cutoﬀ for the
eﬀect of the adsorbed protein on the membrane, justifying the ﬁnite-area assumption. The
uniform charge density, employed merely for simplicity, can be thought of as an eﬀective or
average domain charge density. We thus neglect eﬀects related to charge discreteness. (This
assumption becomes invalid in certain circumstances; we shall return to it in the Discussion.)
The membrane outside the domain serves as a large reservoir, assumed to be unaﬀected by
the protein. Thus, in this study, we refer to the membrane as composed of two blocks, the
protein-aﬀected adsorption domain, with lipid fractions ψi, and the unaﬀected remainder of
the membrane, with fractions φi. The charge densities σ and σm, in the protein-free and
protein-bound regions, respectively, are deﬁned as:

As derived above, however, the applicability of Eq. 8 is more general; it is valid for highly
charged membranes and beyond the mean-ﬁeld approximation. In the absence of protein,
the phospholipid composition would not change and both sides of Eq. 8 are trivially equal to
1. Another consequence of Eq. 8 is that perturbation of one lipid fraction necessarily entails
perturbation in others. In cases where the charge density in the adsorption domain increases
(in absolute value),
, neutral phospholipids will be depleted from the domain to
allow the entrance of charged ones, φ0/ψ0 > 1. The relative enrichment of lipid i, ψi/φi, is
then at least that of the monovalent one raised to the power

As an example, let us consider the binding of a basic protein to a membrane containing
uncharged zwiterionic lipids (e.g., PC), monovalent lipids (e.g., PS) and trivalent ones (e.g.,
PIP2). According to Eq. 8, the polyvalent enrichment ratio will be stronger than that of
the monovalent fraction by at least a power of zi/z1 = 3. This is a strong eﬀect.
If the
monovalent concentration increases twofold, the trivalent concentration will increase by a
factor of 23 = 8. Similarly, a slight decrease in the negative charge of the adsorption domain
leads to a signiﬁcant decrease in polyvalent fraction. Note again that the relative enrichment

Equation 8 provides us only with a relation between the diﬀerent fractions ψi. To cal-
culate the actual values of ψi we need to derive explicit expressions for the electrochemical
potentials µ(0)
and µi. To this end, we must introduce details of the protein. It is treated,
for simplicity, as a ﬂat surface of uniform charge density σp located at a distance h parallel
to the membrane (see Fig. 1). This schematic description may approximate proteins which
have a ﬂat cluster of basic residues facing the membrane at close proximity, while the rest
of the charged residues are further away, screened by the ionic solution. We regard the
protein–membrane distance h as an external parameter determined by other interactions
(e.g., desolvation eﬀects), which are not taken into account in our theory. We further as-

We derive the electrochemical potentials µ(0)

of which are discussed in detail in Appendix I. We ﬁrst apply the commonly used mean-ﬁeld
Poisson-Boltzmann theory (e.g., Andelman, 1995). The resulting nonlinear problem (NLPB)

the PB expressions are linearized (LPB). This approximation is valid when the electrostatic

biological systems this condition is not fulﬁlled, we will see in the Results below that the two
derivations give very similar results. (The reason for this will be discussed below.) The LPB
approximation allows us to derive analytical expressions for µi, yet solutions for the various
lipid fractions (i.e., for the equations µ(0)

i = µi) still cannot be obtained in closed form.

The fact that, in most relevant systems, the electrostatic interactions dominate over
entropy eﬀects (May et al., 2000) enables us to introduce one last approximation, in which

In the second stage, this value of σm is substituted in Eq. 1. Equations 1, 4, and 8 thus
provide a closed set of k polynomial equations which can be easily solved for the k lipid
fractions ψi. We refer to this scheme as the simpliﬁed linear Poisson-Boltzmann method
(SLPB).

RESULTS

To study the eﬀects of protein adsorption on a mixed membrane, we calculated the lipid
fractions for several representative conditions. Our aim is to examine the redistribution of
diﬀerent-valence lipids in the adsorption domain of a membrane-adsorbed protein as a func-
tion of several parameters: protein–membrane distance, protein charge, and the valence of
the most charged lipid species. Unless otherwise stated, we use physiological values for the
Debye length (κ−1 = 10 ˚A), temperature (300 K), dielectric constant of water (ǫ = 80), and
lipid headgroup area (a = 70 ˚A2). Throughout the text, the notation 69%/30%/1% un-
charged/monovalent/polyvalent is used to describe the unperturbed membrane composition
(φi values). For consistency, the results presented in this section were all obtained using the
NLPB method. In addition, at the end of the section, we compare the diﬀerent methods
and comment on their applicability.

Enrichment as a function of protein–membrane distance

The enrichment ratio, ψi/φi, was calculated for the association of a charged protein with a
membrane composed of 69% neutral (zwiterionic), 30% monovalent and 1% trivalent lipids
(in the absence of a protein). This implies an average charge density σ =
0.33e per lipid
headgroup area. We present the enrichment arising from a protein that is slightly more
1.3σ. (These values are typical to protein–membrane
charged than the membrane, σp =
interactions, as will be demonstrated later.) Figure 2 shows the enrichment ratios as a
function of protein–membrane distance.

Far from the membrane (h

κ−1) the protein charge is screened and its eﬀect on the
membrane is weak. As the charged protein approaches the membrane, oppositely charged
lipids move into the adsorption domain while the neutral lipids are depleted from it. The
choice of similar charge densities (in absolute value) for the protein and membrane leads
to minor changes in the fractions of the abundant (neutral and monovalent) lipids, even
at distances smaller than κ−1. Notably, the fraction of trivalent lipids changes by a much

The nonmonotonic behavior at small distances, shown in Fig. 2, is a delicate point that
deserves further discussion. If the membrane charge density had a ﬁxed value σm 6
σp,
then, at a suﬃciently short distance, the mutual attraction between the surfaces would turn
into repulsion (Parsegian and Gingell, 1972). This is caused by the increased concentration
of the salt ions, which are bound to remain in the conﬁned volume between the protein
and membrane in order to neutralize the system.
In our case, however, the system has
the additional freedom to change σm. As a result, the electrostatic contribution to the
free energy of the protein–membrane interaction decreases monotonously with decreasing
distance, i.e., the interaction is purely attractive (cf. Fig. 12). As long as the two objects
are not too close, it may become favorable to overcharge the membrane and gain attraction
energy. This is what happens in the system of Fig. 2 for κh < 1. For example, at κh = 0.5,

we ﬁnd
the osmotic pressure of the salt ions at short distances causes the membrane to decrease its
charge density in order to lower the energetic penalty of further compression (Fig. 2 in the
range κh . 0.5). At contact (κh = 0) we have σm =
σp, such that the system is neutral
without mobile ions. Thus, the ability to redistribute the lipids allows the system to avoid
high concentration of ions in the solution.

Eﬀect of protein charge

In Fig. 3 we present the enrichment ratios (ψi/φi) of the diﬀerent lipid species as a function
of the protein charge density for a given protein–membrane distance and membrane compo-
sition. As expected, when the protein is highly charged, the adsorption domain is strongly
enriched with oppositely charged lipids. On the other hand, at low protein charge, depletion
of charged lipids is observed. Remarkably, in both cases, the trivalent species exhibits a
much stronger eﬀect than the monovalent one. This is again a consequence of the sensitive

Comparison of the diﬀerent calculation methods

Here we compare the NLPB, LPB and SLPB calculation methods that were introduced in the
Model section above. In the limit of weak electrostatic interactions, compared to the thermal
energy T , the LPB method should coincide with the NLPB one. To highlight the diﬀerence
between the methods we therefore chose a highly charged protein (σp = 13e/1000˚A2) as a
case study. The trivalent lipid fractions in the adsorption domain, as calculated using the
three methods, are plotted in Fig. 5. For both long and short distances all three curves
match. In the long distance limit (κh
1), the protein–membrane interaction is weak and
the linearization of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation is valid. At very short distances the
membrane, as described by all three methods, is forced to match the charge density of the
protein (in opposite sign). In the intermediate range the methods diﬀer, yet because of the
two constraints at κh
It is noteworthy that
at distances κh . 0.3 (typical to protein–membrane adsorption), the calculated ψi values
obtained using the three methods diﬀer by less than 10%, and the diﬀerence in magnitude
between the charge densities of the protein and membrane are also less than 10%.

APPLICATION TO PEPTIDE–MEMBRANE INTERACTIONS

In this section we compare the qualitative results of our model with recent experimental
studies of the lateral sequestration of the polyvalent lipid PIP2 by adsorbed basic peptides. It
should be borne in mind that our simple model can only provide an approximate description
of such systems. Treating the interaction region of the peptide as a large ﬂat surface is a
particularly severe simpliﬁcation. We return to this and other weaknesses of the model in
the Discussion below.

We focus on two peptides for which there are available experimental data: FA-MARCKS(151-

175) and a polylysine chain of 13 residues, (Lys)13. The former corresponds to the basic ef-
fector segment of the MARCKS protein, where ﬁve alanine residues were substituted for the
original phenylalanine ones (Gambhir et al., manuscript submitted for publication; Wang

tide, since experiments indicate that its hydrophobic phenylalanine residues pull the peptide
into the membrane such that its backbone penetrates the membrane (Qin and Caﬁso, 1996;
Zhang et al., 2003). This kind of interaction is expected to be sensitive to speciﬁc molecular
details, which are not encompassed by our model.

≪

In order to apply the model, we need an estimate for the area of the peptide that interacts
with the membrane. In our model this area is assumed to be equal to that of the adsorption
domain, A (Fig. 1). It is required for determining the peptide charge density. We built
extended peptides (MOE software, 2002), similar to the ones used by Wang et al. (manuscript
submitted for publication). We then deﬁned the eﬀective peptide area as the area of its
projected backbone plus an envelope of width κ−1 around it.
(This somewhat arbitrary
deﬁnition will be further examined at the end of this section.) Dividing the number of charged
13e/2120˚A2 and 13e/1060˚A2
residues in the peptide by this area, we got the estimates σp ∼
for FA-MARCKS(151-175) and (Lys)13, respectively. Note that for these calculated areas
and typical peptide–membrane distances h of a few angstroms, the basic assumption of the
model, h

√A, is well satisﬁed.

We used these estimated values of σp to produce Fig. 6, plotting the trivalent lipid fraction
in the adsorption domain of each peptide as a function of its distance from the membrane.
In accordance with the experiments (Gambhir et al., manuscript submitted for publica-
tion), we took the unperturbed membrane composition to be: φ0 = 82% (corresponding to
the uncharged zwiterionic PC lipid), φ1 = 17% (monovalent PS), and φ2 = 1% (trivalent
PIP2). Figure 6 shows that the PIP2 fraction rises to 18% in the (Lys)13 adsorption domain,
whereas only 6% PIP2 is obtained in the case of FA-MARCKS(151-175). This is caused by
the higher charge density of (Lys)13, roughly double that of FA-MARCKS(151-175). How-
ever, FA-MARCKS(151-175) has twice the eﬀective area of (Lys)13; thus, if we examine the
average number of PIP2 molecules per peptide adsorption domain, N2, the diﬀerence is less

Consequences of this small value will be addressed in the Discussion below.)

Next, we examined the dependence of the trivalent lipid (PIP2) fraction in the adsorp-
tion domain on φ1, the monovalent lipid fraction in the unperturbed membrane. Figure 7
presents the results obtained for FA-MARCKS(151-175) and (Lys)13 at various distances.
The smaller the value of φ1, the greater the enrichment in trivalent lipids. When there is
a little amount of monovalent lipids, the membrane charge density induced by the peptide–
membrane interaction is attained primarily by the trivalent species. Therefore, at φ1 = 0,
the enrichment in trivalent lipid is maximum. At that limit, the number of PIP2 molecules
per adsorption domain can be simply approximated (at short distances) as the number of
charges on the peptide divided by the lipid valence, N2 ≈ |
. Figure 7 shows that,
under physiological conditions of 30% monovalent lipid fraction and only 1% PIP2, both pep-
tides sequester PIP2—roughly one molecule per FA-MARCKS(151-175) peptide and around
two molecules per (Lys)13 peptide. This result is in qualitative agreement with experiments
(Gambhir et al., manuscript submitted for publication), where (Lys)13 was found to attract
PIP2 stronger than FA-MARCKS(151-175).

The concentration, on average, of about two PIP2 molecules per (Lys)13 would not be
possible if PIP2 were of much diﬀerent valence. Figure 8 shows the average number of
PIP2 molecules per adsorption domain of both peptides as a function of PIP2’s hypothetical
valence. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 4, we ﬁnd a nonmonotonic behavior as a function
3 to 4. It is stressed again that, in view of our simpliﬁed
of valence with a maximum at
model, one should pay more attention to the existence of a competition mechanism, leading
to an optimum valence, than to the exact value obtained for that valence.

In Fig. 9 we show the dependence of the trivalent lipid fraction in the adsorption do-
main on its value in the unperturbed membrane. As expected, ψ2 increases with φ2. This
calculation shows that one needs φ2 & 1% in order to get an average stoichiometry of 1:1
between FA-MARCKS(151-175) and PIP2. As we have seen above, (Lys)13 sequesters PIP2
more eﬀectively. Hence, as demonstrated in Fig. 9, a φ2 value of only 0.1% is suﬃcient
to obtain a 1:1 (Lys)13:PIP2 ratio. That is, (Lys)13 can sequester an appreciable amount

of PIP2 even when the membrane contains 300-fold more PS lipids than PIP2. This value
is in very good agreement, perhaps fortuitously, with the measurements of Gambhir et al.
(manuscript submitted for publication).

Finally, we examined the dependence of the PIP2 enrichment on the ionic strength, i.e.,
the concentration of mobile salt ions in the solution, n0. This parameter enters into the
model through the Debye screening length κ−1, which both scales the distance h and aﬀects
the amplitude of the electrostatic potential (see, e.g., Eq. 20 in Appendix I). Figure 10
shows that ψ2 decreases with ionic strength. This is a result of the increased screening of the
electrostatic attraction between the membrane and protein. The changes are not dramatic
up to quite high n0 values. The reason is the very close proximity of the two objects (3˚A)
for which κh < 1 in the entire n0 range examined.

Eﬀect of approximated peptide size

As discussed above, we deﬁne the eﬀective area of the peptide as the area of its projected
backbone plus an envelope of width κ−1 around it. This deﬁnition, however, is somewhat
arbitrary. One way to overcome this obstacle is to calibrate the eﬀective area via experi-
ments. For example, it might be possible to tune the membrane composition such that the
redistribution eﬀect is minimum, and thus obtain information about the peptide charge den-
sity. Knowing the peptide charge, one could then deduce its eﬀective area. In the absence
of such information, we present here the eﬀect of relaxing the above deﬁnition on the values
obtained for N2.

Figure 11 shows the average number of trivalent lipids N2 per adsorption domain of a
50% of our original

20-amino-acid-long peptide for a range of 1/A values extending to
estimate. In this range the alteration in N2 is limited to

entropy. The derivation is given in Appendix II. The results for the case of FA-MARCKS(151-
175) interacting with a membrane of diﬀerent compositions are presented in Fig. 12. Some
of these compositions have also been studied by Gambhir et al. (manuscript submitted for
publication) and Wang et al. (manuscript submitted for publication). It should be recalled
that our model does not take into account repulsive interactions, such as the Born desolva-
tion eﬀect (see Wang et al., manuscript submitted for publication). Lipid demixing eﬀects
are taken into account in the model, such that the charge density of the membrane may alter
as the peptide approaches the membrane.

As a result, the electrostatic free energy in our model decreases monotonously as FA-
MARCKS(151-175) approaches the membrane. To get the total free energy of association,
one ought to add a repulsive interaction at short distances (not included in our model), that
would yield a free-energy minimum at a distance of a few angstroms (see, e.g., Wang et al.,
manuscript submitted for publication). Thus, the free-energy values presented in Fig. 12 are
probably more negative than the actual binding free energy. More detailed models provide
values for the total binding free energy that are roughly one half the contribution presented
here (Wang et al., manuscript submitted for publication).

As expected, electrostatic attraction between the peptide and the membrane is propor-
tional to the charge density of the membrane (Fig. 12); the interaction free-energy is not
sensitive to the speciﬁc lipid composition of the membrane, but rather to its average charge
density. This result stems from the fact that the contribution of lipid mixing entropy to
the free energy (4’th term in Eq. 22) is minor, and that the membrane, in our model, can
approximately be regarded as a surface of constant electric potential, determined by the
average charge density σ (May et al., 2000). The calculated contribution to the free energy,
therefore, mainly arises from bringing a charged object (protein) into such a potential, re-
gardless of the lipid redistribution. This may also be the reason why FDPB calculations
(e.g. Ben-Tal et al., 1996; Murray et al., 2002), although ignoring lipid redistribution, often
give a good estimate of the binding free energy.

DISCUSSION

Model evaluation

A theoretical model for the eﬀect of an adsorbed charged protein on the distribution of
phospholipids in the membrane has been presented. The major advantage of this model
is its simplicity compared to previous approaches (May et al., 2000; Fleck et al., 2002).
One of the key theoretical results is the relative enrichment equation, Eq. 8, relating the
concentrations of various lipid species in the adsorption domain. It should be emphasized
that this result is almost model-independent. Within a two-block picture, it should hold
for any protein–membrane system governed by electrostatics, regardless of particular details
of the protein, the strength of the electrostatic interactions, and the validity of a mean-
ﬁeld (PB) assumption. The main physical eﬀect described by this relation is the sensitivity
to lipid valence, i.e., the increased concentration of polyvalent lipids compared to that of
monovalent ones in the adsorption domain.

In addition, we have demonstrated how simple Poisson-Boltzmann calculations can be
added to Eq. 8 to obtain further details of the membranal interaction region. In most of
the biologically relevant cases, including the peptides discussed here, the peptide–membrane
distance h is of the order of only a few angstroms (Ben-Tal et al., 1996; 1997; Murray et
al., 2001; 2002). In the context of our model, the elaborate Poisson-Boltzmann theory is
unnecessary for such a thin water layer between the two charged objects. Nevertheless, it
should be recalled that, at any rate, our calculations converge to the correct membrane
σp (cf. Fig. 5).

The model is focused on the qualitative behavior of electrostatically dominated protein–
membrane systems. Our description of the protein–membrane interaction is evidently crude,
as it omits the molecular details of this complex system; see, however, the atomistic descrip-
tion used in the companion report of Wang et al. (manuscript submitted for publication).
Thus, eﬀects related to charge discreteness and three-dimensional structure are ignored. Such
eﬀects, for example, may play an important role in the membrane-adsorption of the MAR-
CKS protein (Zhang et al., 2003). Furthermore, we considered only electrostatic and entropy
eﬀects while neglecting other interactions (e.g., desolvation). The model is not intended to
reproduce such data as the total binding free energy or the optimum protein–membrane
distance (e.g., Ben-Tal et al., 1996; Arbuzova et al., 2000). Similarly, the values that have
been obtained for the various lipid concentrations should be regarded as rough estimates.

Treating a peptide as a large, ﬂat, uniformly charged surface is probably the gravest
simpliﬁcation of the model, deserving further discussion. The assumption of ﬂatness may
be applicable to proteins interacting with the membrane through such eﬀector regions as
those described in Wang et al.
(manuscript submitted for publication) and Gambhir et
al. (manuscript submitted for publication). The assumption regarding the lateral extent of
the peptide is reasonable in cases where the peptide–membrane distance h is much smaller
than both lateral dimensions. For example, in the case of the FA-MARCKS(151-175) dis-
cussed above, we estimated the peptide surface area facing the membrane as a rectangle of
20˚A. The smaller lateral dimension is still signiﬁcantly larger than the
dimensions 106˚A

regard to the smeared-charge simpliﬁcation. Since h is similar to or smaller than the typical
distance between charged groups on the peptide, neglecting charge discreteness is clearly
questionable. Furthermore, spreading the charges of the lipid headgroups evenly over the
membrane is problematic as well. For example, the measured aﬃnity of FA-MARCKS(151-
175) to membranes composed of 99:1 PC:PIP2 was very similar to its aﬃnity to 5:1 PC:PS
5-fold (Wang
membranes, even though these membranes diﬀer in their charge density by
et al., 2002). Clearly, the smeared charge model used here fails to describe such membranes
of low “background” charge density that contain a small amount of PIP2. Still, for simple
PC:PS membranes, the binding free-energy is in a good linear relation to PS mole fraction
(Murray et al., 1999), and adding a trace amount of PIP2 to membranes of reasonable PS
concentrations does not increase the binding signiﬁcantly (Stuart McLaughlin, personal com-
munication). So, as the background charge density of the membrane increases (e.g., higher
PS concentrations), the relative disturbance in membrane potential induced by each PIP2
lipid is less signiﬁcant and could be handled by our model. Overall, the smeared quantities
treated in this paper (e.g., σp, ψi) should therefore be regarded merely as averages, over the
area of the adsorption domain, of more complicated distributions.

∼

Apart from these assumptions, the model contains another implicit simpliﬁcation, namely,
that all the electric ﬁeld lines are contained within the aqueous spacing between the mem-
brane and protein. This commonly used assumption is strictly correct in the limit where the
objects are either inﬁnitely thick or of a vanishing dielectric constant. As will be reported
elsewhere, we ﬁnd that this approximation is, in fact, still good for objects of ǫ = 2 and
thickness as small as one third the Debye length.

On the positive side, the simpliﬁed model presented here provides new insights into
lipid redistribution caused by protein adsorption. Although most of the results presented
in this work were obtained using a numerical solution of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann
equation, we have demonstrated how one can get the same qualitative results using a much
simpler calculation, merely involving a set of polynomial equations (the SLPB scheme).
Such a scheme may serve as a better starting point for more detailed numerical calculations,

16

e.g., FDPB (Honig et al., 1993). In most of the current FDPB calculations, a predeﬁned
membrane composition identical to that of the bare membrane is used (Ben-Tal et al., 1996;
1997; Murray et al., 1999; Wang et al., manuscript submitted for publication). This arbitrary
description of the adsorption domain may be improved if one uses a preliminary analysis of
the type presented here to produce an approximated lipid conﬁguration.

Future extensions of this work may include phenomena such as elastic deformation of
the membrane (Dan et al., 1993; May, 2000), adsorption of multiple proteins (May et al.,
2000), nonuniform charge density in the adsorption domain (May et al., 2000), and acid
dissociation at diﬀerent pH values (Fleck et al., 2002).

Biological implications

ENTH, FYVE, PH, PX, and other membrane-association domains use predeﬁned stereo-
chemistry to recognize poly-phosphoinositides (McLaughlin et al., 2002; Lemmon, 2003).
These domains, which are commonly found in proteins involved in intracellular signalling,
bind tightly to the poly-phosphoinositides, often via ion-pairs, anchoring the protein ﬁrmly
and irreversibly to membrane surfaces. The binding speciﬁcity is reﬂected in the evolution-
ary conservation across the homologous domains comprising the family; usually the amino
acid residues that mediate the poly-phosphoinositides binding are strictly conserved and can
often serve as sequence signatures to recognize these domains using sequence analysis tools.
Here we dealt with a much less speciﬁc, and often reversible, mode of membrane recog-
nition via a cluster of basic residues on the membrane-facing region of the protein. These
residues interact electrostatically with acidic lipids in the adsorption domain on the bilayer
surface. Our model showed that in such cases, membrane association induces a preference
for polyvalent lipids such as PIP2 to sequester in the adsorption domain. The number
of sequestered polyvalent lipids may be regulated by the charge density and size of the
membrane-interaction region on the protein. This result supports the suggestion, advocated
in the accompanying papers (Gambhir et al., manuscript submitted for publication; Wang
that membrane-associated proteins such as
et al., manuscript submitted for publication),
adducin (Matsuoka et al., 2000), DAKAP200 (Rossi et al., 1999), GAP43 (Laux et al., 2000),
MARCKS (Wang et al., 2002), and MacMARCKS (Blackshear, 1993), which contain a clus-
ter of basic residues, may create a reservoir of PIP2 molecules in their adsorption domain
(McLaughlin et al., 2002). It may further imply that the membrane-interaction region of
such proteins does not have to be strictly conserved evolutionarily; it should only preserve
a speciﬁc charge density, as in C2 domains (Murray and Honig, 2002). This speculation,
naturally, needs to be checked in future studies.

We found that, when all other parameters are held ﬁxed, there is an optimum value of
lipid valence that yields a maximum enrichment in the adsorption domain (Figs. 4 and 8).
This value, resulting from a competition between entropy and simple stoichiometry, is found
to be at reasonable valence values (e.g. z∗
4 in the examples above). Thus, if in a
−
certain biological scenario there is a need to increase the local concentration of a phospholipid
by electrostatic interactions, a polyvalent lipid valence larger than 1 but not too large (say,

Assuming a certain valence for PIP2 and a certain distance for peptide association
with the membrane, our model enables the derivation of a set of approximate rules re-

lating the number of basic residues on the peptide to the average number of sequestered
PIP2 molecules per peptide. For example, assuming a trivalent PIP2 and association dis-
tance of about 3˚A, under physiological conditions, each segment of seven consecutive ly-
sine residues of an adsorbed poly-lysine peptide, such as (Lys)13 (Fig. 7B), would sequester
approximately one PIP2 molecule when the membrane composition is 69%/30%/1% un-
charged/monovalent/trivalent, and roughly one and a half PIP2 molecules when the mem-
brane composition is 82%/17%/1%. These results are in good agreement with the detailed
calculations reported in the companion report of Wang et al. (cf. Table 2B in Wang et al.,

Equations 16 and 17 are solved numerically for the two unknowns y(0) and y(h), the surface
potentials of the membrane and protein. Finally, the values of y(0) and y(0)(0) (Eq. 13) are
used in Eq. 10 to calculate the values of ψi.

If entropy is neglected in µ(0)
and µi, we are left with a uniform surface potential y(0)(0) =
y(0). In the LPB approximation we equate the expressions 19 and 20 to obtain the charge
density in the adsorption domain in closed form as given in Eq. 9 (May et al. 2000). Substi-
tuting σm in Eq. 1 yields a set of k equations, Eqs. 1, 4, and 8, which are easily solved for
the k lipid fractions ψi.

APPENDIX II

In this appendix we calculate the free energy of protein–membrane interaction as arising
from our model. It should be recalled that the model treats only the simple electrostatics
and entropy of the system, leaving out additional eﬀects such as Born desolvation and van
der Waals interactions. Hence, what is presented here is not the total binding free energy
but only the contributions due to simple electrostatics and entropy.
In particular, since
charges are allowed to redistribute in the membrane, the interaction is purely attractive
and the free energy decreases monotonously with distance, reaching its minimum at h = 0.
This should be contrasted with the FDPB calculations (e.g., Ben-Tal et al., 1996; Wang et
al., manuscript submitted for publication) which takes desolvation into account and yield a
free-energy minimum at a ﬁnite distance.

The general form of the free energy per unit area within a mean-ﬁeld approximation is

The ﬁrst term in Eq. 21 is the energy associated with the mean electric ﬁeld. The second
term corresponds to the interaction of the mobile ions with the ﬁeld, where n+ and n− are
the local concentrations of the monovalent positive and negative ions. The second integral
accounts for the ideal entropy of mixing of the mobile ions and their contact with reservoirs of
mobile ions having chemical potentials µ+ and µ−. The last line in expression 21 corresponds
to the surface energy of the membrane and protein, including mixing entropy of the lipids
and electrostatic interactions.

Setting the variations of F with respect to n+, n−, and Ψ to zero, one properly recovers the
Boltzmann relations for the mobile ions, the Poisson equation, and, hence, also the Poisson-
Boltzmann equation. Using these results along with Eq. 15, and changing the integration
variable from z to y, we obtain the following simpliﬁed expression for the free energy:

F (h) =

where the constant C was deﬁned in Eq. 15. We can now use the values obtained for y(0),
y(h), µi, and ψi, as described in appendix I, to calculate the free-energy of interaction F (h).

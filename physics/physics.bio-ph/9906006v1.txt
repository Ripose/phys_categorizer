A discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) model with long-range dispersive interac-
tions describing the dynamical structure of DNA is proposed. Dispersive inter-
actions of two types: the power dependence r−s and the exponential dependence
e−β r on the distance, r, are studied. For s less than some critical value, scr, and
similarly for β ≤ βcr there is an interval of bistability where two stable station-
ary states : narrow, pinned states and broad, mobile states exist at each value
of the total energy. For cubic nonlinearity the bistability of the solitons occurs
for dipole-dipole dispersive interaction (s = 3), and for the inverse radius of the
dispersive interaction β ≤ βcr = 1.67. For increasing degree of nonlinearity, σ, the
critical values scr and βcr increase. The long-distance behavior of the intrinsically
localized states depends on s. For s > 3 their tails are exponential while for
2 < s < 3 they are algebraic. A controlled switching between pinned and mobile
states is demonstrated applying a spatially symmetric perturbation in the form
of a parametric kick. The mechanism could be important for controlling energy
storage and transport in DNA molecules.

1 Introduction

Understanding the mechanisms of the functioning of biological macromolecules
(proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) remains for now the major challenge in molecular
biology. One of the most important questions is the understanding of gene
expression. The expression of a given gene involves two steps: transcription
and translation. The transcription includes copying the linear genetic infor-
mation into the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The information stored
in mRNA is transferred into a sequence of aminoacids using the genetic code.
mRNA is produced by the enzyme RNA-polymerase (RNAP) which binds to
the promoter segment of DNA. As a result of the interaction between RNAP
and promoter of DNA the so-called ”bubble” (i.e. a state in which 10–20 base
pairs are disrupted) is formed. The disruption of 20 base pairs corresponds to
investing some 100 kcal/mole (0.43 eV) 1.

1

In the framework of a linear model the large-amplitude motion of the bases
was supposed to occur due to an interference mechanism 2. According to this
model energetic solvent molecules kick DNA and create elastic waves therein.
As a result of the interference of two counter propagating elastic waves, the
base displacements may exceed the elasticity threshold such that DNA under-
goes a transition to a kink form which is more ﬂexible. A similar approach
was also proposed 3,4. The linear elastic waves in DNA are assumed to be
strong enough to break a hydrogen bond and thereby facilitate the disruption
of base pairs. In spite of the attractiveness of this theory which gives at least
a qualitative interpretation of the experimental data 5 there are following fun-
damental diﬃculties which to our opinion are inherent to the linear model of
the DNA dynamics: i) The dispersive properties (the dependence of the group
velocity on the wave-length) of the vibrational degrees of freedom in DNA will
cause spreading of the wave packets and therefore smear the interference pat-
tern. Furthermore, it has been shown 6 that the amplitudes of the sugar and
the base vibrations are rather large even in a crystalline phase of DNA. Since
the large-amplitude vibrations in the molecules and the molecular complexes
are usually highly anharmonic their nonlinear properties can not be ignored.
ii) Molecules and ions which exist in the solution permanently interact with
DNA. These interactions are usually considered as white noise and their inﬂu-
ence is modelled by introducing Langevin stochastic forces into the equations
describing the intramolecular motion. It is well known 7 that stochastic forces
provide relaxation of linear excitations and destroy their coherent properties.
Equivalently the coherence length (the length of the concerted motions) rapidly
decreases with increasing temperature.
iii) DNA is a complex system which
has many nearly isoenergetic ground states and may therefore be considered
as a ﬂuctuating aperiodic system. DNA may have physical characteristics in
common with quasi-one-dimensional disordered crystals or glasses. However,
it is known 8 that the transmission coeﬃcient for a linear wave propagating
in disordered chain decreases exponentially with the growth of the distance
(Anderson localization). In this way it is diﬃcult to explain in the framework
of linear theory such a phenomenon as an action at distance where concerted
motion initiated at one end of a biological molecule can be transmitted to its
other end.

The above mentioned fundamental problems can be overcome in the frame-
work of nonlinear models of DNA. Nonlinear interactions can give rise to very
stable excitations, called solitons, which can travel without being smeared out.
These excitations are very robust and important in the coherent transfer of
energy 9. For realistic interatomic potentials the solitary waves are compres-
sive and supersonic. They propagate without energy loss, and their collisions

2

are almost elastic.

Nonlinear interactions between atoms in DNA can give rise to intrinsically
localized breather-like vibration modes 10,11. Localized modes being large-
amplitude vibrations of a few (2 or 3) particles, can facilitate the disruption of
base pairs and in this way initiate conformational transitions in DNA. These
modes can occur as a result of modulational instability of continuum-like non-
linear modes 12 which is created by energy exchange mechanisms between the
nonlinear excitations. The latter favors the growth of the large excitations 13.
Nonlinear solitary excitations can maintain their overall shape on long time
scales even in the presence of the thermal ﬂuctuations. Their robust character
under the inﬂuence of white noise was demonstrated14 and a simpliﬁed model of
double-stranded DNA was proposed and explored. Quite recently the stability
of highly localized, breather-like, excitations in discrete nonlinear lattices under
the inﬂuence of thermal ﬂuctuations was investigated 15. It was shown that
the lifetime of a breather increases with increasing nonlinearity and in this way
these intrinsically localized modes may provide an excitation energy storage
even at room temperatures where the environment is seriously ﬂuctuating.

Several theoretical models have been proposed in the study of the nonlinear
dynamics and statistical mechanics of DNA (see the very comprehensive review
16). A particularly fruitful model was proposed by Peyrard and Bishop 17
and Techera, Daemen and Prohofsky 18. In the framework of this model the
DNA molecule is considered to consist of two chains that are transversely
coupled. Each chain models one of the two polynucleotide strands of the
DNA molecule. A base is considered to be rigid body connected with its
opposite partner through the hydrogen-bond potential V (un), where un is
2, .. is
the stretching of the bond connecting the bases, n, and n = 0,
labelling the base-pairs. The stretching of the n′th base-pair is coupled with
the stretching of the m′th base-pair through a dispersive potential K(un, um).
The process of DNA denaturation was studied 17,19 under the assumption that
the coupling between neighboring base-pairs is harmonic K(un, un+1). An
entropy-driven denaturation was investigated20 taking into account a nonlinear
potential K(un, un+1) between neighboring base-pairs. The Morse potential
was chosen 17,19,20 as the on-site potential V (un) but also the longitudinal wave
propagation and the denaturation of DNA has been investigated 14 using the
Lennard-Jones potential to describe the hydrogen bonds.

In the main part of the previous studies the dispersive interaction K was
assumed to be short-ranged and a nearest-neighbor approximation was used.
It is worth noticing, however, that one of two hydrogen bonds which is re-
H...O
sponsible for the interbase coupling: the hydrogen bond in the N
group is characterized by a ﬁnite dipole moment. Therefore a stretching of

−

the base-pair will cause a change of the dipole moment so that the excitation
transfer in the molecule will be due to transition dipole-dipole interaction with
a 1/r3 dependence on the distance, r. It is also well known that nucleotides in
DNA are connected by hydrogen-bonded water ﬁlaments 21,22. In this case an
eﬀective long-range excitation transfer may occur due to the nucleotide-water
coupling.

In the last few years the importance of the eﬀect of long-range interac-
tions (LRI) on the properties of nonlinear excitations was demonstrated in
several diﬀerent areas of physics. The eﬀective mass of solitons in the Frenkel-
Kontorova model with a repulsive LRI, their shapes and Peierls barriers were
investigated 23. An implicit form of solitons was obtained 24 in a sine-Gordon
system with a LRI of the Kac-Baker type 25,26 and the dependence of the soli-
ton width and energy on the radius of the LRI was analyzed. It was postulated
27 that the nonlinear term in the sine-Gordon equation has a non-local char-
acter and novel soliton states, of topological charge zero, were found to exist
at a large enough radius of the interaction. The eﬀects of long-range inter-
actions of the Kac-Baker type were studied in static and dynamic nonlinear
Klein-Gordon models 28, and nonlinear Schr¨odinger 29 continuum models. The
eﬀects of a long-range harmonic interaction in a chain with short-range anhar-
monicity were also considered 30. It was demonstrated that the existence of
two velocity dependent competing length scales leads to two types of solitons
with characteristically diﬀerent widths and shapes for two velocity regions sep-
arated by a gap. A nonlocal NLS equation was proposed 29 for systems with
long-range dispersion eﬀects. In contrast to the usual NLS equation station-
ary solutions only exist for a ﬁnite interval of the number of excitations. In
the upper part of this interval two diﬀerent kinds of stationary solutions were
found. The new one containing a cusp soliton was shown to be unstable. It
was also pointed out that moving solitons radiate with a wavelength propor-
tional to the velocity. Quite recently 31 we proposed a new nonlocal discrete
NLS model with a power dependence on the distance of matrix element of
dispersive interaction. It was found that there is an interval of bistability in
the NLS models with a long-range dispersive interaction. One of these states
is a continuum-like soliton and the other is an intrinsically localized mode.

The goal of this contribution is to investigate the eﬀects of long-range in-
teractions on the nonlinear dynamics of the two-strand model of DNA. In Sec.
II we present the analytical theory and the results of numerical simulations
of stationary states of the discrete NLS model with a long-range dispersive
interaction. We discuss the bistability phenomenon for the soliton solutions
and their stability. In the analytical part of this section we use a variational
approach exploiting an exp-like function as a trial function. Then, in Sec. III

4

we investigate the long-distance behavior of the nonlinear excitations and show
that intrinsically localized states of the discrete NLS model with a dispersive
interaction decaying slower than 1/r3 have algebraic tails. Section IV is de-
voted to the investigation of switching between bistable states. We show that
a controlled switching between narrow, pinned states and broad, mobile states
with only small radiative losses is possible when the stationary states possess
an internal breathing mode.

erties illuminates both the competition between nonlinearity and dispersion
and the interplay of long-range interactions and lattice discreteness. To take

there exist for each N in the interval [Nl(s), Nu(s)]. In particular, this means
that in the case of dipole-dipole interaction (s = 3) multiple solutions exist. It
is noteworthy that similar results are obtained when the dispersive interaction
is in the form of the Kac-Baker potential (6). In this case the bistability takes

gous to the critical curve in the van der Waals’ theory of liquid-vapour phase

behavior where two phases are the continuum states and the intrinsically local-
ized states, respectively. The analog of temperature is the parameter s. Figure

where ℓ = exp(1/s) is the characteristic length scale of the dispersive interac-

tion which is deﬁned as a distance at which the interaction decreases twice.
It is seen from these expressions that the existence of two so diﬀerent soliton
states for one value of the excitation number, N, is due to the presence of two
diﬀerent length scales in the system: the usual scale of the NLS model which
is related to the competition between nonlinearity and dispersion (expressed
in terms of the ratio N/J ) and the range of the dispersive interaction ℓ.

Now we turn to discus stationary states of the discrete NLS model given
by Eq. (17) with arbitrary degree of nonlinearity. The main properties of the
system remain unchanged, but the critical value of the dispersion parameter
scr is now a function of σ. The results of analytical consideration conﬁrmed
by simulation show that scr increases with increasing σ.
In particular, for

. Thus we can conclude here that only in the case of the short-
range dispersion (s > 3) the tails of intrinsically localized states have a usual
exponential form. In the systems with long-range dispersive interactions these
states have algebraic tails. Figure 5 shows the long-distance behavior of the
intrinsically localized states for s = 2.5 and diﬀerent values of the frequency Λ.
It is seen that the form of the tails predicted by Eq. (31) is in a good agreement
with the results of numerical simulations.

The long-distance behavior of the intrinsically localized states may play an
essential role in the thermodynamic properties of the DNA molecule because
in systems where the interaction decays algebraically it can be responsible for
the appearance of new thermodynamically stable states (for example, quite
recently 36 the existence of the Neel order in the ground state of Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic chains with algebraic long-range interactions was proven).

4 Switching between bistable states

Having established the existence of bistable stationary states in the nonlocal
discrete NLS system, a natural question that arises concerns the role of these
states in the full dynamics of the model.
In particular, it is of interest to
investigate the possibility of switching between the stable states under the in-
ﬂuence of external perturbations, and what type of perturbations could be used

13

to control the switching. Switching of this type is important in the description
of nonlinear transport and storage of energy in biomolecules like the DNA,
since a mobile continuum-like excitation can provide action at distance while
the switching to a discrete, pinned state can facilitate the structural changes of
the DNA 16,5. As it was shown recently 37 the switching will occur if the system
is perturbed in a way so that an internal, spatially localized and symmetric
mode (’breathing mode’) of the stationary state is excited above a threshold

perturbation ǫn(τ ) as calculated from Eq. (33) remains bounded for all times.
Linear stability is then equivalent to the matrix
having no eigenvalues with
a positive real part. Changing some parameter (e.g. Λ), a stable state might
become unstable. The ’direction’ in which an initial perturbation will grow
is then determined by the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of
M
with a positive real part. We will in sequel mainly discuss the case when the
matrix element of base elastic coupling Jn−m decreases exponentially with the

For such value of β the multistability occurs in the interval 3.23

It is worth noticing, however, that the scenario of switching described below
remains qualitatively unchanged for all values of β

algebraically decaying dispersive coupling with 2

existence of a spatially symmetric internal breathing mode for both the nar-
row and broad components of the bistable state. Furthermore, the low fre-
quency (broad) component also possesses a spatially antisymmetric transla-
tional (”pinning”) mode 38. Since the appearance of a translational mode

implies that the stationary state gains mobility 38, the continuum-like state
will have a high mobility.

An illustration of how the presence of an internal breathing mode can af-
fect the dynamics of a slightly perturbed stable stationary state is given in Fig.
6. To excite the breathing mode we apply a spatially symmetric, localized per-
turbation, which we choose to conserve the number of excitations in order not
to change the eﬀective nonlinearity of the system. The simplest choice, which
we have used in the simulations shown here, is to kick the central site n0 of the
system at t = 0 by adding a parametric force term of the form θδn,n0δ(τ )ψn(τ )
to the left-hand-side of Eq. (14). A possible physical motivation of the appear-
ance of such kind of parametric kick may be the following. It is well known
that biomolecules in cells interact with solvent molecules and ions (ligands).
At the position where the ligand links to a biomolecule the potential energy of
the biomolecule changes. This manifests itself in a local change of the vibration
frequency of biomolecular units. In our case it means that the frequency ω of
the internal base-pairs oscillations locally changes and the potential energy (4)
should be replaced by

where n0 is the site where the ligand interacts with the biomolecule, θ is a
constant which characterizes the energy interaction between the ligand and
biomolecule. It may be a function of time because the ligand may attach or
detach at diﬀerent time moments. If we use the rotating wave approximation
(8) the NLS model given by Eq. (9) with the additional term in Eq. (12) being

we obtain the model where the attachment and detachment of ligands are
considered as kicks which occur at the time moments τj.

As can be easily shown, this perturbation aﬀects only the site n0 at τ = 0,
and results in a ’twist’ of the stationary state at this state with an angle θ,
i.e. ψn0 (0) = φn0 eiθ. The immediate consequence of this kick is, as can been
deduced from the form of Eq. (14), that d
will be positive (negative)
dτ
when θ > 0 ( θ < 0). Thus, to obtain switching from the continuum-like
state to the discrete state we choose θ > 0, while we choose θ < 0 when
investigating switching in the opposite direction. We ﬁnd that in a large part
of the multistability regime there is a well-deﬁned threshold value θth, such
that when the initial phase torsion is smaller than θth, periodic, slowly decay-
ing ’breather’ oscillations around the initial state will occur, while for strong
enough kicks (phase torsions larger than θth) the state switches into the other
stable stationary state.

It is worth remarking that the particular choice of perturbation is not
important for the qualitative features of the switching, as long as there is a
substantial overlap between the perturbation and the internal breathing mode.
We believe also that the mechanism for switching described here can be applied
for any multistable system where the instability is connected with a breathing
mode. For example, we observed 39 a similar switching behavior in the nearest
neighbor discrete NLS equation with a higher degree of nonlinearity σ, which
is known 33 to exhibit multistability.

5 Conclusion

We have proposed a new nonlocal discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger model for
the dynamical structure of DNA with long-range (r−s and e−βr) dispersive
interaction. We have shown that there is a multistability in the spectrum of

16

stationary states of the model with a long-range dispersive interaction s < scr
(β < βcr). There is an energy interval where two stable stationary states exist
at each value of the Hamiltonian
. One of these states is a continuum-like
soliton and the other one is an intrinsically localized mode. The existence of
the bistability phenomenon in the NLS models with a nonlocal dispersion is a
result of the competition of two length scales which exist in the system: the
scale related to the competition between nonlinearity and dispersion, and the
scale related to the dispersion interaction.

H

We found that the critical value of the dispersion parameter scr for the
on-site stationary state in the case of cubic nonlinearity exceeds 3. This means
that the bistable behavior may occur in the case of DNA where the stretching
motion of base-pairs is accompanied by a change of their dipole moments.

We have shown that the long-distance behavior of intrinsically localized
states in discrete NLS models with a nonlocal dispersion depends drastically
on the value of the dispersive parameter s. Only for short-range dispersions
the excitation wave functions decay exponentially. In the systems where the
matrix element of base elastic coupling depends on the distance slower than
1/r3 the nonlinear excitations have algebraic tails. The long-distance behavior
may be important for the thermodynamics of DNA since it provides long-range
order in one-dimensional systems.

We have shown that a controlled switching between narrow, pinned states
and broad, mobile states is possible. Applying a perturbation in the form of
parametric kick, we showed that switching occurs beyond some well-deﬁned
threshold value of the kick strength.

The particular choice of perturbation is not important for the qualitative
features of the switching, as long as there is a substantial overlap between
the perturbation and the internal breathing mode. Thus, we believe that the
mechanism for switching described here can be applied for any multistable sys-
tem where the instability is connected with a breathing mode. The switching
phenomenon could be important for controlling energy storage and transport
in DNA molecules.

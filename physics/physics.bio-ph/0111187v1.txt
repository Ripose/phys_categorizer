ABSTRACT. The opening rate of voltage-
gated potassium ion channels exhibits a char-
acteristic, knee-like turnover where the com-
mon exponential voltage-dependence changes
suddenly into a linear one. An explanation of
this puzzling crossover is put forward in terms
of a stochastic ﬁrst passage time analysis. The
theory predicts that the exponential voltage-
dependence correlates with the exponential dis-
tribution of closed residence times. This fea-
ture occurs at large negative voltages when the
channel is predominantly closed. In contrast,
the linear part of voltage-dependence emerges
together with a non-exponential distribution of
closed dwelling times with increasing voltage,
yielding a large opening rate. Depending on
the parameter set, the closed-time distribution
displays a power law behavior which extends
over several decades.

Introduction

Voltage-dependent ion channels of biological mem-
branes are formed by pore-like single proteins which
poke through the cell membrane. They provide the
conducting pathways for the ions of speciﬁc sorts (1,2).
Such potassium K+ and sodium Na+ channels partic-
ipate in many important processes occurring in liv-
ing cells. For example, these are crucial for the phe-
nomenon of neural excitability (3).

Two features are important for the biological func-
tion of these naturally occurring nanotubes. First,
they either are dwelling in open conformations, al-
lowing for the ion ﬂow to pass through, or are rest-
ing in closed, non-conducting conformations. Between
these two conformation types the ion channel under-
goes spontaneous, temperature driven transitions – the
so-called gating dynamics – which can be character-
ized by the residence time distributions of open, fo(t),
and closed, fc(t), states, respectively. The mean open
and closed residence times,
tfo(c)(t)dt
are prominent quantiﬁers of the gating dynamics. In

particular, they determine the mean opening (closing)
−1. The second important feature
rates ko(c) :=
refers to the fact that the gating dynamics is voltage-
dependent. This provides a mechanism for a mutual
coupling among otherwise independent ion channels.
This very mechanism is realized through the common
membrane potential. Both ingredients are central for
the seminal model of neuronal activity put forward by
Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 (3).

The dichotomous character of gating transitions
yields a bistable dynamics of the Kramers type (4).
Therefore, a priori one expects that both, the opening
and the closing gating rates will expose an exponen-
tial, Arrhenius-like dependence on voltage and temper-
ature. Indeed, the closing rate of many K+ channels
follows such a pattern; in clear contrast, however, the
opening rate usually does not. To explain the exper-
imental voltage-dependence of the relaxation time of
the potassium current for a giant squid axon Hodgkin
and Huxley (3) postulated that the gating behavior of
a potassium channel is determined by four indepen-
dent voltage-sensitive gates, each of which undergoes
a two-state Markov dynamics with a form (3, 5)

for the opening rate, which is commonly used in neuro-
physiology. In Eq. 1, ac, bc, Vc are some experimental
parameters. Notwithstanding that in their work (3)
this kind of dependence has been used for a single gate,
the opening rate of the whole K+ channel can also be
ﬁtted by Eq. 1, see e.g. in (6). The same modeling for
a whole channel is used also for dendritic K+ channels
in neocortical pyramidal neurons (5).

Note that in Eq. 1 the voltage-dependence of the
opening rate changes in a knee-like manner from an
exponential behavior into a linear one, cf. Fig. 1. This
typical, experimentally observed behavior of delayed
rectiﬁer K+ channels presently lacks an explanation
in physical terms. A qualitative explanation of this
gating dynamics has brieﬂy been mentioned in recent
work (8). However, a deﬁnite analysis leading to the
functional form in Eq. 1 is not available. A ﬁrst main

objective of the present work is to ﬁll this gap, and,
moreover, to provide additional insight into the voltage
behavior of Eq. 1 within an exactly solvable stochastic
Fokker-Planck-Kramers model.

The ion current recordings made on the level of sin-
gle ion channels (2) reveal yet another unresolved, in-
teresting aspect of the gating dynamics. Namely, the
distribution of closed residence times of many channels
is not exponential. In particular, it has been shown by
Liebovitch et al. (9) that the closed residence time dis-
tribution fc(t) in a rabbit corneal endothelium channel
can be reasonably ﬁtted by a stretched exponential
with only two parameters. This result initiated the
construction of the so-called fractal model of ion chan-
nel gating (9, 10). Other channels, e.g., K+ channels
in neuroblastoma x glioma (NG 108-15) cells exhibit
t−α
a power-law scaling behavior as well, i.e. fc(t)
with α = 3/2 (11). To explain this type of fractal-
like behavior Millhauser et al. (12) proposed a one-
dimensional diﬀusion model. Similar power laws with
α > 3/2 have also been reported (13) and several vari-
ations of diﬀusion theory have been introduced to ex-
plain the gating behavior of diﬀerent channels (14–16).
The observed non-exponential behavior can be ﬁtted
by a ﬁnite sum of exponentials; consequently, it can
alternatively be explained with a corresponding dis-
crete Markovian scheme (11). These discrete Marko-
vian models have proven their usefulness in many cases
(17). Nevertheless, such an approach presents a ﬁtting
procedure; as such it is intimately connected with the

on a complex free energy landscape. Two global
minima correspond to open and closed macrocon-
formations. One assumes a large number of quasi-
degenerated (within kBT ) and voltage-independent
closed substates separated from the open conforma-
tion by a voltage-dependent potential barrier. This
idea is sketched by a simpliﬁed model of the Fokker-
Planck-Kramers type, and by a discrete model with
open (O), closed (C) and inactivated (I) states.

danger of a proliferation of parameters. In particular,
kinetic schemes containing as many as 14 structurally
unidentiﬁed closed substates have been proposed (18).
An important lesson to be learned from the detailed
studies of a simple protein – myoglobin – by Frauen-
felder et al. (19) is that proteins exist in a huge num-
ber of quasi-degenerated, microscopic substates, cor-
responding to a single macroscopic conformation, cf.
Fig. 2. It is thus conceivable that at room tempera-
tures the ion channel dwells in a huge number of almost
degenerated (within kBT ) conformational substates.
Both the fractal and diﬀusion models of the ion chan-
nel gating have been inspired by this crucial property
of proteins. We conjecture that the ultimate theory of
the ion channel gating must take this property into ac-
count. This program requires a compromise between
Markovian discrete state models and a continuous dif-
fusion model. This can be achieved by a Kramers type
theory (4,8). The discrete Markov models can then be
considered as a limiting case of more general Kramers
type approach (4).

Theoretical modeling

The complex structure of the multi-dimensional con-
formational space of proteins implies an intricate ki-
netics despite an apparently simple bistability that is
observed (19). Two popular theoretical approaches

2

have been developed to cope with this complexity. A
ﬁrst one uses a simple bistable dynamics as a basis.
To model the complexity of the observed kinetics this
dynamics is amended by using an additional stochas-
tic time-dependence of the energy proﬁle, or kinetic
constants. Such an approach is nowadays commonly
known under the label of “ﬂuctuating barriers” (20).
Alternatively, one can attempt to model the complex-
ity of the energy proﬁle itself in the simplest possible
way. Our strategy is to ﬁnd such a minimal model of
the second kind which does allow for a rigorous analy-
sis and does reproduce some nontrivial features of the
gating dynamics.

Let us assume that the conformational stochastic
dynamics between the open and closed states can be
described in terms of a one-dimensional reaction co-
ordinate dynamics x(t) in a conformational poten-
tial U (x), Figs. 2,3. Since the distribution of open
residence time intervals assumes typically a single-
exponential (1), in the following we rather shall fo-
cus on the behavior of the closed residence time in-
tervals. In order to evaluate the distribution of closed
residence time intervals it suﬃces to restrict our anal-
ysis to the subspace of closed states by putting an
absorbing boundary at the interface, x = b, between
the closed and open conformations, see Fig. 3. We
next assume that the gating dynamics is governed by
two gates: an inactivation gate and an activation gate.
The inactivation gate corresponds to the manifold of
voltage-independent closed substates. It is associated
with the ﬂat part,
L < x < 0, of the potential U (x)
in Fig. 3. In this respect, our modeling resembles that
in (21). The mechanism of inactivation in potassium
channels is quite sophisticated and presently not to-
tally established (1). It is well known that inactivation
can occur on quite diﬀerent time scales (1). The role of
a fast inactivation gate in Shaker K+ channels is taken
over by the channel’s extended N-terminus which is ca-
pable to plug the channel’s pore from the cytosol part
while diﬀusing towards the pore center (22). The slow
inactivation apparently is due to a conformational nar-
rowing of the channel pore in the region of selectivity
ﬁlter (1). In both cases, no net gating charge translo-
cation occurs and the inactivation process does not
depend on voltage. When the inactivating plug is out-
side of the pore, or the selectivity ﬁlter is open (x > 0
in Fig. 3) the channel can open only if the activation
barrier is overcome.

−

The dynamics of the activation gate occurs on the
linear part of the ramp of the potential U (x); i.e. on
0 < x < b in Fig. 3, like in (16). Note that for
0 < x < b, the inactivating plug diﬀuses outside of the
channel’s pore and the selectivity ﬁlter is open. Dur-
ing the activation step a gating charge q moves across
the membrane, this feature renders the overall gating

dynamics voltage-dependent. The channel opens when
the reaction coordinate reaches the location x = b in
Fig. 3. This fact is accounted for by putting an ab-
sorbing boundary condition at x = b. Moreover, the
channel closes immediately when the inactivation gate
closes (x
0), or when the activation gate closes. To
account for this behavior in extracting the closed res-
idence time distribution we assume that the channel
is reset into the state x = 0 after each closure (see
below).

The diﬀusional motion of the inactivated gate is re-
stricted in conformational space. We characterize this
fact by the introduction of a conformational diﬀusion

length L (Fig. 3) and the diﬀusion constant D
that are combined into a single parameter – the con-
formational diﬀusion time

This quantity constitutes an essential parameter for
the theory. We assume that the activation barrier

V (16), i.e. in terms of the gating charge q we have

U0 =

q(V

Moreover, U0 is positive for negative voltages, i.e. for
V < Vc, vanishes at V = Vc, and becomes negative for
V > Vc. Thus, for V > Vc the channel “slips” in its
open state, rather than overcomes a barrier. In addi-
tion, the fraction ξ of the voltage-dependent substates
in the whole manifold of the closed states should be

the result in 11 precisely coincides with Eq. 1. The
fact that our novel approach yields the puzzling volt-

of this work.

Let us next estimate the model parameters for a
Shaker IR K+ channel from Ref. (6).
In (6), the
voltage-dependence of ko(V ) at T = 18 oC has been
parameterized by Eq. 1 with the parameters given in
the caption of Fig. 1. Then, from Eq. 12 the gating
20e (e is the positive
charge can be estimated as q
valued, elementary charge). As to the diﬀusion time
τD, we speculate that it corresponds to the time scale
of inactivation; the latter is in the range of seconds
and larger (6). Therefore, we use τD = 1 sec as a
lower bound for our estimate. The fraction of voltage-
dependent states ξ is then extracted from Eq. 13 to
yield, ξ
0.0267. This value, indeed, is rather small
and thus proves our ﬁnding in Eq. 11 to be consistent.
Analysis for the closed residence time dis-
tribution. The exact results in Eqs. 7-9 appear
rather entangled. To extract the behavior in real time
one needs to invert the Laplace transform numerically.
With ξ << 1, however, Eqs. 7-9 are formally reduced

Origin of the power law distribution. The fea-
tures displayed by the closed residence time distri-
bution fc(t) depend sensitively on the applied volt-
age V . When V > Vc, e.g. V =
45 mV, as
in Fig. 4, the activation barrier towards the chan-
nel opening disappears and the opening dynamics be-
comes diﬀusion-limited. In this case, the diﬀusion time
τD = 1 sec largely exceeds the mean closed residence
time
and
the closed residence time distribution exhibits an in-
tricate behavior with three distinct regions, see in Fig.
4. Most importantly, for the intermediate time scale
2/τD ≪
we ﬁnd from Eq. 14 (by considering the limit τD →
) that the closed residence time distribution obeys a

power law; reading

from Eq. 18, an increase of τD by one order of magni-

is fully conﬁrmed by our numerics (not shown). This
power law dependence, which extends over four orders
of magnitude, has been seen experimentally for a K+
channel in NG 108-15 cells (11). On the contrary, for
channels, where τD is smaller, the power law region 18
shrinks and eventually disappears, whereas the mean
opening rate deﬁned via Eq. 10 still exhibits a steep
dependence on the voltage. Thus, our model is capable
to describe for diﬀerent channels both, the emergence
of power law as well as its absence.

On the time scale t

τD the discussed power law
distribution crosses over into the exponential tail; the
latter is fully described by the smallest exponent λ1 in

grounds!

channel is predominantly closed. Then, the diﬀusion
step in the opening becomes negligible and in the ex-
perimentally relevant range of closed residence times,
, the corresponding distribution can be
deﬁned by
approximated by a single exponential 20. A perturba-
tion theory in Eq. 16 yields λ1 ≈
(koτD)/3). For
ko(1

0.96ko and, from
the used parameters we have λ1 ≈
0.95. This result is in a perfect agree-
Eq. 17, c1 ≈
ment with the precise numerics obtained from Eqs.
7-9. Thus, the distribution of closed residence times
is single-exponential to a very good degree. Conse-
quently, one and the same channel can exhibit both,
an exponential and a power-law distribution of closed
residence times, as a function of the applied trans-
membrane voltage. With an increase of τD the voltage
range of the exponential behavior shifts towards more
negative voltages, V < Vc, and vice versa.

particle jumps with the equal forward and backward
rates k between the adjacent states which are occupied
with probabilities pn(t). At the right edge of the chain
of closed states the ion channel undergoes transition
into the open state with the voltage-dependent rate
constant γ. To calculate the closed residence time dis-
tribution fc(t) one assumes p0(0) = 1, pn6=0(0) = 0 and

clear contrast with our approach, the rate parameter
ko in the diﬀusion model is of pure phenomenological
origin. The problem of ﬁnding the closed residence

We emphasize that the radiation boundary condition
22 is not postulated, but is rather derived from the
original discrete model in the considered scaling limit.
Using the Laplace transform method we solved this
problem exactly and obtained the result in Eq. 14. In
conclusion, our approximate result in Eqs.14-17 pro-
vides the exact solution of the diﬀusion model (12, 15)
in the scaling limit! This exact analytical solution is
obtained here for the ﬁrst time. Note, however, that
this so obtained diﬀusion model is not able to resolve
the puzzling voltage dependence in Eq. 1.

Synopsis and Conclusions

With this work we put forward a unifying generaliza-
tion of the diﬀusion theory of ion channel gating by
Millhauser et al. (12,15). Our novel theory reproduces
for the ﬁrst time the functional form of the puzzling
voltage-dependence in Eq. 1. The latter has been pos-
tulated almost ﬁfty years ago in the pioneering paper
by Hodgkin and Huxley (3) and is commonly used in
the neurophysiology up to now. The proposed model
of the Fokker-Planck-Kramers type explains the ori-
gin of steep voltage-dependence in Eq. 1 within a
clear physical picture which seemingly is consistent
with both our current understanding of the physics of
proteins and basic experimental facts. Our study fur-
thermore reveals the connection between the voltage
dependence of the opening rate and the intricate be-
havior for the closed residence time distribution in cor-
responding voltage regimes. A particularly appealing
feature of our approach is that our model contains only

four voltage-independent physical parameters: the dif-
fusion time τD, the fraction of voltage -dependent sub-
states ξ, the gating charge q and the threshold voltage
Vc. Several experimental ﬁndings could be described
consistently while still other ones call for an experi-
mental validation.

1/(kBT ), yielding ac ∼

In particular, when (i) the activation barrier is very
Vc, the activation step determines com-
high, i.e., V
≪
pletely the opening rate:
the distribution of closed
residence times is nearly exponential, as well as the
voltage-dependence of the opening rate. The chan-
nel is then predominantly closed. We remark that
the opening rate should exhibit an exponential depen-
dence on temperature as well. This conclusion fol-
lows from Eqs. 11-12 and the fact that in accord
with our model the parameter ac in Eq. 1 is tem-
perature independent. Indeed, with the diﬀusion time
τD being inversely proportional to the temperature,
1/(τDkBT ),
1/D
i.e. τD ∼
∼
In contrast, when (ii) the activation
cf. Eq. 13.
the voltage shifts towards the
barrier vanishes, i.e.
positive direction, the closed residence time distribu-
tion becomes non-exponential. On the intermediate
time scale given in Eq. 18, this distribution exhibits
t−3/2, which crosses
a power law behavior, fc(t)
over into an exponential one at t > τD. The emer-
gence of the exponential tail can be used to determine
the conformational diﬀusion time τD experimentally.
When (iii) the activation barrier assumes negative val-
ues at voltages V > Vc, our result for the opening rate
exhibits a linear dependence on voltage and, conse-
quently, see Eq. 11, it no longer depends on temper-
ature. The weak temperature dependence will emerge
however when we renormalize the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
D due to the roughness of random energy landscape
(cf. Fig. 2). Assuming uncorrelated Gaussian disor-

a clear thermodynamic interpretation: when the ac-

only weakly depend on temperature. In accord with
our model this type of behavior correlates with a non-
exponential kinetics.

The temperature behavior of the opening rate (or,

Abstract

We present results from the theoretical INDO calculations of the electronic structure for
stacked eumelanins’ monomers. As basic indolic components of the eumelanin structure
5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI or HQ) and its oxidized forms (SQ and IQ) were chosen. The
results reveal dependency of electronic properties of such aggregates on monomers’ redox
states. They point out also a tendency to localize an extra charge on one of dimer’s subunits
that could be suggestive of an electron hopping as a model mechanism for the electron
transfer in eumelanins.

1 Introduction

Melanin is a photoactive biopolymer [1], a common biological pigment responsible
for much of coloration observed in nature. Despite its ubiquity, documented photo-
protective [2,3] character, reported photosensitizing activity [4,5] and otherwise hy-
pothesized multifunctionality of the pigment in animals and humans [1,6], neither
the size nor the structure of the fundamental molecular unit of the melanins has been
well understood yet. Black eumelanins are composed of indolic units derived from
the oxidation of tyrosine: among those 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI or HQ) together
with their oxidized forms (indole-5,6-quinone (IQ)) and semiquinone (SQ) and
5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) are usually accepted [1,2,4,7,8]
as main components of natural eumelanins and their synthetic analogues.
Photoreactivity, ability to bind transition metal ions, redox properties and presence
of persistent free radical centers in the pigment structure are usually mentioned as
main features of eumelanins [2], although their biological signiﬁcance is still un-
clear.
X-ray diffraction measurements of dried synthetic pigments have led to a model
that pictures eumelanin [7,8,9,10] as a π - stack of crosslinked planar oligomeric
structures with a spacing of ≈ 3.4Å. Such a π-conjugated, randomly arranged het-
eropolymer system could be responsible for intrinsic semiconductivity of eume-

lanins [2,6,11,12].
The eumelanins’ monomers, as well as their dimers and polymers have been sub-
ject to theoretical studies in the framework of Hückel theory [11,12,13] that have
supported the hypothesis of eumelanins as semiconductors. A further investiga-
tion along those lines has been performed for the charged monomers [14] where
the stability of charged HQ, SQ and IQ was investigated. Following that study all
monomers have been concluded to be strong electron acceptors (in the decreasing
order from SQ to IQ to HQ). Elucidation of the spectral properties of synthetic
eumelanins has been also addressed [14,15] pointing out consequences of the as-
sumed random organisation of the polymer that explains well experimental absorp-
tion spectra of synthetic eumelanins.
The aim of the present study is to examine electronic properties: orbital- and charge-
localization of stacked eumelanins’ monomers forming an "indolic sandwich" with
a characteristic separation distance of about 3Å. Two parallel, mostly planar monomers
(Figure 1) laying one above the other are chosen as a main unit for modelling. A
few assemblies in which one of the monomers has been rotated or moved apart
have been also examined checking for the effect of conformational variations on
formation of a stable dimeric unit.
Natural eumelanins are built of both DHI and DHICA [6] monomers but it is pos-
sible to prepare synthetic material as pure DHI– or DHICA–melanin [10]. In this
respect, the article focuses on a distinct class of synthetic eumelanins discussing
properties of simple DHIs aggregates only.

2 Methods

Since experimental data on the geometry of the monomers are not available, the
model structures have been created in the InsightII/MSI module [16] and geomet-
rically optimized by use of the consistent valence forceﬁeld (CVFF) [16] until the
demanded covergence in energy has been achieved (the maximum derivative less
than 0.0001 kcal mol−1 Å−1). Coordinates of such monomers have been used as
input data for semiempirical INDO calculations [17]. Ground electronic states of
the neutral charged molecules, as well as of the negatively charged molecules from

2

wich one H+ ion was removed (the number of electrons remains the same), have
been obtained as closed-shell molecular orbital wave functions in the Hartree-Fock
(RHF) framework. For molecules with an extra electron or without one elctron Un-
restricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) method has been used.
For molecules without hydrogen ion the ﬁrst excited states were calculated by con-
ﬁguration interactions (CI) among conﬁgurations generated as single excitations
from RHF ground state. The CI method included the highest 10(20) occupied and
lowest 10(20) unoccupied molecular orbitals for the monomers(dimers). 1 At the
ﬁrst step, the calculations have been performed for each monomer (HQ, IQ and SQ)
and then for the aggregates built of two stacked monomers (HH, II, SS, SH, HI, IS).
For simplicity, we adopt here a notation where HH, II, SH, etc. stand for dimers of
HQ-HQ, IQ-IQ and SQ-HQ, respectively. The distance between molecules has been
controlled within the range 2.86-4.12Å by a translation (a shift in the z-coordinate)
of all atoms forming a displaced monomer in the pair. In order to test whether
the mirror symmetry of dimer coordinates in HH, II and SS assemblies does not
generate special results in the INDO runs, model HQ-HQ aggregates were built
in which one monomer has been optimized with the CVFF and the second with a
slightly different version of the consistent valence forceﬁled [16] intended for ap-
plication to polymers and organic materials (PCFF). Such a procedure breaks the
symmetry of the aggregate producing nevertheless fully agreeable INDO results
for both HQpcf f -HQcf vv and HQcf vv-HQcf vv sets of data. To check for localization
of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals a simple routine has been undertaken: In the
LCAO framework each molecular orbital (ψi) is composed as a linear combination
of atomic orbitals (φk) ψi = Pk cikφk. The ratio of the sum of squared coefﬁcients
c2
ik over atomic orbitals of one of the monomers to the relevant sum for all atoms in
a dimer has been assumed to be a measure of the localization of the i−th molecular
orbital:

orbital localization = Pone monomer c2
ik
Pboth monomers c2
ik

.

(1)

Based on the density matrix, all charges and their distributions have been calculated
according to the Mulliken population analysis.

1 Our test calculations have revealed that expansion of the CI basis to more than 20 highest
occupied nad 20 lowest unoccupied orbitals does not change signiﬁcantly neither the values
of estimated excitation energies nor the main contributions cik to the molecular orbitals of
the dimer.

3 Results

3.1 Neutral dimers

In the absence of any extra charge both monomers remain neutral for all distances
reported in this study. The biggest value for charge separation has been observed
for SQ-HQ set at the distance 2 2.86 Å (charge 0.26 and -0.26 respectively). The
degree of orbital localization as deﬁned above is displayed in Figuress 2 and 3.

The results of the analysis are displayed as HOMO (LUMO) localization for HQ
monomer in the sets of HS, IH dimers and as HOMO (LUMO) localization for SQ
monomer in the IS dimers, respectively. By inspection of Figure 2 one can deduce
that in the case of symmetrical assemblies HOMO is delocalized even at relatively
large separations of monomers. This tendency remains also unchanged for HQcvf f -
HQpcf f sets, for which the spatial symmetry of coordinates is broken. At extremal
intermolecular distances (≈ 10 Å) the HOMO orbital becomes localized on one of

2 Intermolecular distances have been deﬁned as distances between the mean planes located
on all atoms of the separated monomers.

the monomers that has been examined for both HQcvf f -HQpcf f and HQcvf f -HQcvf f
dimers sets. However, the delocalization decreases faster with encreasing distance
when the mixed sets of dimers (SH, HI, IS) are analyzed. Distances of about 3.28-
3.7Å seem to be "transition distances": If the monomers are closer to each other,
they behave as supermolecule, if they are farther apart, they become two separated
molecules.
Additional examination provides further arguments that at large distances (≈ 4Å),
the supermolecular structure of dimers breaks down and monomers behave as two
weakly interacting molecules. By analyzing the ﬁve largest coefﬁcients cik and the
energy of the relevant orbitals we have found that at the distance 4.12 Å HOMO-
1/HOMO/LUMO/LUMO+1 aggregates’ orbitals are created of HOMO/LUMO rel-
evant monomers’ orbitals. (see Tab. 1).

When the intermolecular distance decreases, HOMO of the aggregate becomes a
mixture of the HOMOs of both monomers. At the same time the HOMO-LUMO
gap does not change and remains within the range 0.20-0.22a.u. for HI and 0.19-
0.20a.u. for SH dimers, respectively. However, in the case of the IS dimers a mono-
tonic decrease in the energy of the HOMO-LUMO gap is registered (from 0.20a.u.
at 4.12 Å to 0.16 at 2.86 Å). Figure 2 comprises also an extra data set for SH dimers:
In one case the molecules have been shifted apart preserving the same intermolecu-
lar distance - a bigger ring of one molecule was above the smaller ring of the other.
In the second case, one of the molecules has been rotated in plane by 90◦ or 180◦
(monomers remained parallel). The results indicate that such a variation in the con-
ﬁguration of a dimer changes signiﬁcantly localization of orbitals, although none
persistent tendencies have been observed. In contrast to HOMO, LUMO orbitals
reveal lower tendency to delocalization. Only LUMO of the IS aggregate is more
delocalized (at small intermolecular distances) than its HOMO.

3.2 Charged dimers

In case of molecules with unchanged number of atoms both, negatively and posi-
tively charged assemblies have been examined. Charge localization for symmetrical
sets (HH, II, SS) are displayed in the Figure 4. As can be inferred from the latter,
an extra charge placed on a dimer is localized on one of the monomers, although as
expected, the smaller the distance, the tendency of charge delocalization becomes
more noticeable.
For negatively charged heterogeneous assemblies (SH, HI, IS), at all intermolecu-
lar distances the charge is localized on the more electron-liked monomer, i.e. (SH)−
results in localization of charge on S monomer, (SH)− = S−H and similarily, (HI)−
= H−I and (IS)− = IS−.
This ﬁnding changes however when a positive charge is taken into account. The
molecules are poor electron-donors and our results show that the positive charge
becomes localized on one of the monomers without any correlation with distance
or monomer’s redox state.
For negatively charged systems the localization of the HOMO orbital has been also
examined indicating that the orbitals are restrained exactly to the same monomer
as the charge itself.
Similar behavior has been observed for dimers of molecules with a proton removed
from the -OH group of one of the constituing monomers (cf. Figures 5, 6).

With the exception of the HS-dimer sets, all HOMOs for deprotonated assemblies
are localized on different monomer than the relevant LUMOs (cf. Figures 5, 6).
At the same time negative charge is localized on the same monomer as the relevant
HOMO of the dimer (Figure 7). The results of our computational analysis point out
a persistent tendency for localization of charge/HOMO/LUMO within the studied
dimeric assemblies of DHI monomers at the separation exceeding 3.4Å. Following

the observation of HOMOs and LUMOs localization in the dimer, we have also ex-
amined the structure of ﬁrst excited states of the assemblies. In most cases, the ﬁrst
excited state of a dimer is composed of its relevant HOMO→LUMO excitation,
the apparent exceptions are however HI dimers at 3.00–3.14 Å separation and SH
dimers at 3.28Å separation whose ﬁrst excited states are mostly composed of the
HOMO-1→LUMO transitions. Similarily, the ﬁrst excited state of the SH dimer at
3.00–3.14Å separation and of the IS dimer at 3.42Å (and more) separation are pre-
dominantly formed of the HOMO-1→LUMO and HOMO→LUMO+1 transitions,
respectively.

on redox state of its components as well as on the way the molecule has gained
the charge. Heterogeneous structures (SH, HI, IS) tend to behave as two separate
molecules even if the distance between the molecules is small. Moreover, nega-
tively charged dimers formed by adding an excessive electron to the neutral aggre-
gate are characterized by the charge localization on a more electron-like monomer.
In dimers where one of constituing monomers has been deprotonated, the proton-
deﬁcient monomer holds the negative charge independent of the electron-afﬁnity of
the neighbouring molecule in the set.
Homogeneous sets (HH, II, SS) of monomers show a stronger tendency to create
dimers than the respective heterogeneous assemblies and at comparable distances
they behave as one supermolecule with its HOMO and LUMO orbitals smeared
over the whole structure. Additional charge in this structures becomes, however,
located on one monomer only. Similar conclusion can be drawn from the prelimi-
nary studies on sets of planar pentameric polymers formed of indolic units, whose
structure and absorption properties have been discussed elsewhere [15]. Same anal-
ysis performed for neutral and charged assemblies of that type has revealed that also
in the pentamers of randomly assemblied HQ,IQ and SQ molecules, the excessive
charge becomes localized on one of constituing monomers. This result suggests
that, in spite of the electron-acceptor properties, the indolic dimers (and most likely,
indolequinone polymers, in general) do not stabilize the charge by delocalization
over the entire structure, but rather tend to position the charge on one of the com-
posing molecules.
The additional analysis performed on the SH dimer sets with one molecule ro-
tated or translated with respect to another suggests that electronic properties of the
complex may strongly depend on its conformations. Nevertheless, if we limit our

9

considerations to characteristic distances (3.4Å) reported in experimental studies,
the aformentioned general conculsions remain valid.

The above ﬁndings along with the conclusions recalled from References [12,13,6,2]
suggest a highly dynamic picture of hypothetical eumelanins, whose chemical struc-
ture has been proven to be composed mainly of DHI molecules in different redox
states. The redox state of the melanin units may change spontaneously under the in-
ﬂuence of the environment (acidity, exposure to light and oxygen) and their relevant
proportion and state of oxidation may vary in time. In agreement with the former
theoretical studies [14], our results show high charge localization in basic clusters
of eumelanin structure. Given the latter and an apparent localization of the HOMO
and LUMO orbitals on one of the monomers in the stack, the electron-acceptor be-
havior of the melanin can be viewed as a process in which an electron injected (or
photogenerated) in the polymer remains trapped or transfers via a hopping mecha-
nism in between the indolic subunits. Moreover, any temporary charge distribution
within the eumelanin complex can be altered e.g. in the process of spontaneous
HQ→IQ reaction that effectively will also inﬂuence structure of frontier orbitals
of the aggregate. Discussed from that perspective, eumelanins can be understood
as amorphous polymers whose macroscopic electronic properties are essentially
ensemble-average of various structures.

Clariﬁcation of the detailed mechanisms involved in the DNA polymorphism is an important chal-
lenge for computational molecular biophysics. This paper reports about reversible A↔B transitions
in DNA observed in silico in a simulated titration experiment by smooth variation of the size of a
water drop around a double helical solute. The estimated range of hydration numbers correspond-
ing to the B↔A transition roughly agrees with experimental data. The chain length dependence
was studied and it appeared that the transition to A-form is hindered when the fragment becomes
shorter than one helical turn. Dynamics of the A↔B transition at low hydration is cooperative
and is driven mainly by medium range electrostatic interactions of counterions sandwiched between
phosphate strands in the major groove. The correspondence of these computational observations to
common experimental conditions of A↔B transitions is discussed.

Introduction

The transformation from B-DNA1 to dehydrated A-
DNA2 in ﬁbers was one of the ﬁrst reversible struc-
tural transitions observed in a biomolecule. These struc-
tures represent right-handed helical duplexes with identi-
cal topologies and hydrogen bonding, and yet they have
strongly diﬀerent shapes3,4. The B helix is long and nar-
row, with stacked base pairs forming the core of the he-
lix. In contrast, the A-DNA structure is short and thick,
with strongly inclined base pairs wrapping around a 6
˚A solvent accessible cylindrical hole. The B-form is the
dominant biological conformation of DNA whereas the
A-form is considered as a high energy state that some se-
quences can adopt temporarily during various biological
functions5. Indeed, local A-DNA motives are rather com-
mon in crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes6,7.
The A↔B polymorphism is currently considered as one
of the modes for governing protein-DNA interactions8.

as in ﬁlms11, it is induced by equilibrating the samples
under reduced relative humidity or with the concentra-
tion of organic solvents increased to ≈80%12. Organic
solvents can also provoke B→A transition in an isolated
DNA molecule in solution13. The transition is reversible
and cooperative,14,15 which means that it occurs concert-
edly in an extended DNA fragment rather than randomly
in separate nucleotides. The characteristic length of such
fragment, however, is is rather small. Originally, it was
estimated as 20 base pairs15, but later this estimate was
reduced to 10 base pairs13, that is approximately one
helical turn. DNA fragments shorter than this length
generally do not go to the A-form in solution16,17. For
some sequences, however, short DNA fragments could be
crystallized in the A-form18,19. Under physiological con-
ditions in vitro, the A/B balance depends upon the envi-
ronment, notably, the types of solvent counterions14 and
the temperature20. It is also sequence dependent, with
some sequences exhibiting in solution the features of both

forms16,21,22. The transition is signiﬁcantly facilitated in
groups of consecutive guanines (G-tracts) whereas in A-
tracts it is more diﬃcult9,23,24. The A/B-philicity of dif-
ferent base pair steps and triplets has been parametrized
and used successfully for predicting the properties of
mixed sequences5,25,26.

aspects

Several diﬀerent ideas concerning detailed molec-
of A↔B
ular
transitions
in DNA were discussed in diﬀerent
years4,14,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. Both the sugar phosphate
backbone29 and base pair stacking28 were proposed as
one of the possible actors in the transition, with water
as an evident second partner. Water bridges between
certain DNA atoms may stabilize either B-DNA28 or
A-DNA29, and the hydrophobic eﬀect possibly favors
a B-DNA type of stacking14,30.
It has been suggested
that the reduced water activity is a universal factor that
shifts the equilibrium towards A-DNA34, which was later
replaced by a less speciﬁc ”economics of hydration”29.
Although the B→A transition induced by increased salt
concentration has been reported for poly-dG, the low
water activity in high salt generally does not induce
B→A transitions14,35.
In any case, it is not clear how
the reduced amount of water around DNA aﬀects its
structure at the atomic level36. Molecular dynamics
that accumulation
in addition,
simulations suggest,
of metal cations in the major groove may speciﬁcally
stabilize A-DNA31,32.

The cooperativity of the B→A transition is poorly
understood. Its physical origin was initially attributed
to the sugar puckering14,15. The furanose ring confor-
mation is C3’-endo (North) in A-DNA (with the C3’-
carbon puckered above the furanose plane towards the
nucleobase), and C2’-endo (South) in B-DNA3. For
a single nucleoside in vacuum, the C2’-endo conforma-
tion is slightly lower in energy, with the barrier of 2-
3 kcal/mole between the two states37, and this is the
only signiﬁcant local energy barrier between the A- and
B-DNA conformations. Until recently, it was assumed
that the switch in the sugar pucker is strictly linked
with the base pair orientation. The latter is restrained
due to stacking interactions with the neighbors, there-

fore, the sugar conformations can change only simulta-
neously in at least several consecutive base pairs. These
views, however, were always questioned28 and the re-
cent X-ray and spectroscopic studies really demonstrated
that the North sugar puckers are accessible without the
B→A transition16,21,22, and even with all sugars in the
C3’-endo conformation the overall B-DNA structure can
persist8. It appears, therefore, that the sugar conforma-
tions are only weakly restrained by the stacking and the
observed cooperativity can hardly be due to the sugar
pseudorotation barrier. At the same time, the ensemble
of the currently available X-ray DNA structures agrees
with the cooperative character of the B→A transition.
Although some A-DNA structures have B-like features
near the termini38, and there exist a series of structures
classiﬁed as A/B transition intermediates39 the A- and
B-forms generally do not mix in the same DNA fragment.
The two forms may even coexist in a crystal, but in dif-
ferent samples of the same fragment40.

Many aspect of the A/B polymorphism were earlier
studied by theoretical methods. Its thermodynamics is
well described by an analytical theory based upon the
Ising model15. Reduced28,30,41 and all atom42 mod-
els in continuous dielectric were used for studying its
mechanism and sequence dependence. On the other
hand, diﬀerent analytical theories combined with sim-
pliﬁed DNA representation were used for modeling sol-
vent eﬀects43. Steady progress in MD simulations of
DNA since the pioneering calculations by Levitt44 re-
cently made possible detailed modeling of A/B transi-
tions in realistic environment including explicit water and
metal counterions31,32,33,45,46,47,48,49,50. They shed new
light upon the putative molecular mechanisms involved
in the DNA A/B polymorphism despite limited time of
MD trajectories and some forceﬁeld artifacts51.

cently been shown that the particle-mesh Ewald (PME)
algorithm allows one to follow the dynamics of a DNA
double helix put in a small salty water drop52. An evident
question one asks, what happens if the size of the drop is
reduced? By analogy with drying ﬁber samples it should
be expected that DNA would go from B to A-form. A
series of simulations described here conﬁrms that this is
really the case. Although these conditions have never
been used in experiments our simulations give the best
currently possible prediction of the properties of such sys-
tems. Moreover, the transition is reversible in the time
scale accessible in the calculations, that is both B→A and
A→B transitions can be observed in the nanosecond time
range. This allows one to test diﬀerent hypotheses con-
cerning the factors governing the transition. The results
suggest that the A↔B transitions in an isolated water
drop are driven by medium range electrostatic interac-
tions between DNA backbone and counterions accumu-
lated in the major groove. Moreover, several evidences
suggest that A↔B transitions in other conditions are ac-
tually governed by the same mechanism.

In the

series MD simulations presented here
the Dickerson-Drew
dodecamer
double
(CGCGAATTCGCG53) and its derivatives are used as
examples. Similar results were also observed for several
other test sequences. This particular DNA fragment is
preferred because it is neither A-philic or B-philic and
because its dynamic structure with Cornell et al.
force
ﬁeld54 is rather close to experimental data47,55,56. The
simulation protocols were similar to the earlier water
drop simulations52. We use the internal coordinate
molecular dynamics (ICMD) method57,58 adapted for
DNA59,60 with the time step of 0.01 ps. The electrostatic
interactions are evaluated with the shifted Coulomb
law by using the SPME method52,61 and the long
range cut-oﬀ of 50 ˚A which was always larger than the
system size. The Van-der-Waals and SPME direct sum
interactions were truncated at 9 ˚A with the value of
Ewald parameter β ≈ 0.35.

The initial state for B→A transitions was prepared as
before52 with the canonical B-DNA62 used a standard
conformation. The DNA molecule was ﬁrst immersed in
a large rectangular TIP3P63 water box of and next ex-
ternal solvent molecules were removed by using a spher-
ical distance cut-oﬀ from DNA atoms. The cut-oﬀ ra-
dius was adjusted to obtain the desired number of water
molecules remaining. The drop was neutralized by ran-
domly adding the necessary number of Na+ ions. Simula-
tions of A→B transitions started from the ﬁnal structure
of a B→A transition obtained with the lowest hydration.
Every system was energy minimized ﬁrst with the so-
lute held rigid and then with all degrees of freedom. Dy-
namics were initiated with the Maxwell distribution of
generalized momenta at 250K and equilibrated at this
temperature during several picoseconds. Production tra-
jectories were computed with the temperature bound to
300 K by the Berendsen algorithm64 with a relaxation
time of 10 ps. For better comparison with earlier sim-
ulations of A↔B transitions, the original Cornell et al.
force ﬁled54 was used. Several test simulations showed,
however, that qualitatively similar results are obtained
with the subsequent modiﬁcations of the AMBER force
ﬁled65,66. Duration of production runs varied from 5
to 25 ns depending upon the character of dynamics ob-
served. The conformations were saved with a 2.5 ps in-
terval. Programs Curves,67 XmMol68 and Mathematica
by Wolfram Research Inc. were employed in the data
processing.

is shown in Fig. 1. The top row exhibits the canonical
B- and A-DNA structures. The process begins with plate

conformation. This system involves a dodecamer DNA
fragment with 22 Na+ and 400 water molecules.
It is
seen that after the equilibration some ions have already
entered the major groove while a thin water shell covers
the surface of the DNA molecule. One may notice also a
small narrowing in the middle of the minor groove which
is a well-known distinctive feature of the crystal structure
of this dodecamer. This initial trend is only temporary,
however. The number of water molecules in the system
is about 17 per nucleotide, which is less than the limit-
ing hydration number for B-DNA3. In dynamics, water
tries to form a smooth spherical drop around the DNA

fragment and this is achieved owing to a B→A transi-
tion. Plate 2 shows a snapshot after 2 ns of dynamics. It
is seen that the DNA molecule went to the characteris-
tic A-form conformation with a wide minor and narrow
major grooves. Note that a substantial part of the Na+
ions is sandwiched in the major groove between the two
opposite sugar-phosphate strands. The more compact
A-form structure allows water to form a nearly spherical
drop that covers the DNA fragment. After the transition
the structure remains stable during the time accessible
in calculations.

The ﬁnal state of the previous trajectory was used as
a starting point for the second run to obtain an inverse
A→B transition. For this purpose the system was sur-
rounded by 600 additional water molecules to increase
their number to 1000. Plate 3 in Fig. 1 displays a snap-
shot from the beginning of the second production run.
Now the number of water molecules is about 42 per nu-
cleotide, which corresponds to B-DNA hydration num-
bers. The last plate in Fig. 1 shows a snapshot after 2 ns
of dynamics. As we see, the DNA molecule really went
back from A- to B-DNA conformation and the narrowing
in the middle of the minor groove re-appeared.

The sequence of transitions shown in Fig. 1 suggests
that there exists a critical level of hydration characterized
by an equal probability of A and B-forms, if the transi-
tion is cooperative, or by some structures intermediate
between the two.
In order to get a rough estimate of
this midway point, a series of MD simulations was car-
ried out with the size of the water drop systematically
varied. The results obtained are summarized in Table I.
The corresponding trajectories were started from stan-
dard A-DNA and B-DNA states and continued as long
as necessary to reach either A→B or B→A transition.
For intermediate hydration values, notably, for 21 and
25 water molecules per nucleotide, very long trajectories
were necessary. In all cases a transition in one direction
only was obtained. For instance, with 25 water molecules

FIG. 2: A representative example of dynamics of a B→A transition.
(a) Time traces of some important parameters. From top to bottom: the average twist and rise; the average backbone length
computed as the distance between the centers of consecutive sugar rings; the average width of the major and minor grooves;
the total energy; the rmsd from the canonical A-DNA (dotted line) and B-DNA (solid line). The horizontal broken lines in
some frames mark the canonical B and A-DNA values.
(b) The time evolution of the minor groove proﬁle. The surface is formed by 23 minor groove proﬁles equally spaced in time
and each averaged over a 75 ps interval. The proﬁle on the front face corresponds to the ﬁnal DNA conformation. The groove
width is evaluated by perpendicular cross-sections of space traces of C5’ atoms69, with the measured distances assigned to the
sequence of the upper (”Watson”) strand. The empty zone on the left corresponds to the region where the groove could not be
measured. The width is given in angstr¨oms and the corresponding canonical A- and B-DNA levels of are marked in all plates
by the thin straight lines.
(c) The time evolution of the major groove proﬁle. The surface is constructed similarly to plate (b). The empty zone on the
right corresponds to the region where the groove could not be measured.
(d) Dynamics of sugar pucker pseudorotation. Only the pucker phase values from 0 to 180 were considered. Sugars with phases
beyond this interval were assigned the closest of the two boundary values. The minimal and the maximal phases obtained were
assigned the white and the black colors, respectively, with intermediate values mapped linearly to the gray scale levels. Each
base pair step is characterized by a column consisting of two sub-columns, with the left sub-columns referring to the sequence
written above in 5’-3’ direction from left to right with the time averaged phases given on top. The right sub-columns refer to
the complementary sequence shown below together with the corresponding time averaged phases.

per nucleotide an alternative trajectory starting from A-
DNA was continued to 10 ns, but no transition occurred.
The results summarized in Table I suggest that the hy-
dration of 25 water molecules per nucleotide can serve as
a rough estimate of the transition point.

As seen in Fig. 1, the A-DNA structure obtained in
dynamics is more compact than the canonical conforma-
tion. The major groove width in the structure averaged
over the last nanosecond is about 2 ˚A below the canonical
value. The ﬁnal A-DNA structures obtained for higher
hydration levels had slightly wider major grooves. Note
that, in Table I, their rmsd from the canonical A-DNA
is lower. In all cases, however, structures with the ma-
jor groove width similar to that in the canonical A-DNA
were observed only temporarily in intermediate transi-
tion phases, and they seemed to be unstable with respect
to the more compact conformation shown in plate 2 of
Fig. 1. Visual inspection reveals that in such structures
the phosphate groups opposed across the major groove
are similarly close or even closer to each other than the
neighboring phosphates in the same strand. They are
linked by multiple water bridges and at least one such
bridge is usually replaced by a Na+ ion slightly shifted
either inside or outside the helix. With intermediate hy-
dration numbers, however, this pattern was less clear,
with both Na+ and the opposite phosphate groups often
hydrated separately.

One of the trajectories mentioned in Table I is de-
tailed in Fig. 2. This simulation started from the canon-
ical B-DNA with a water shell of 500 molecules (20.8
per nucleotide). Plate (a) exhibits time plots of several
structural parameters. Three of them, namely, the back-
bone length and the average width of the two grooves
deserve preliminary comments. The backbone length is
computed as the average distance between the centers of
consecutive sugar rings. Note that its value is larger in A-
DNA than in B-DNA because, in a B→A transition, the
sugars are moved to the outer surface of the double he-
lix, with the helical diameter of the sugar trace increased
by nearly 6 ˚A. The widths of both grooves are evaluated
by perpendicular cross-sections of spatial traces of C5’
atoms69. Near the helical termini, however, the grooves
are not measurable and, in fact, the groove lengths vary
in dynamics. The last feature is very clear in the dynam-
ics of the major groove proﬁle shown in plate (c). The
average widths were computed for the zones where the
corresponding groove was deﬁned in each given structure.
The B→A transition seen in Fig. 2 is relatively slow,
with the ﬁnal structure established only after 18 ns. An
early B→A transition occurred close to one of the termini
at around 10 ns. However, it was incomplete and inverted
two nanoseconds later. According to the two rmsd traces,
the ﬁnal transition started at 13 ns. Until that the dy-
namics sampled midway conformations between A- and
B-forms, which is not that far from normal B-DNA dy-
namics with the same potentials47,55,56. It may be seen
that the minor groove proﬁle periodically switched from
narrowing to widening in the middle. At about 13 ns the

5

two rmsd traces drastically moved close to their ﬁnal lev-
els. Simultaneously the major groove width fell by almost
10 ˚A and went below the A-DNA level. At that time the
molecule already looked very much like A-DNA, with the
instantaneous rmsd-A values around 2 ˚A, but almost all
sugars still had their puckers in the South region. The ﬁ-
nal phase of the transition is slower and during this phase
the sugars in the middle AATT tetraplet switch to the
North. In this middle zone the transition to the A-form is
complete whereas the three terminal base pairs remain in
an intermediate conformation with South sugar puckers.
Although the structural parameters shown in plate (a)
diﬀer by the amplitudes of ﬂuctuations they all reveal
a slow overall drift suggesting a downhill motion of the
system on a free energy surface. In contrast, the total
energy remains stable throughout the trajectory except
the initial phase. This means that, already during heat-
ing, the system ﬁnds a balance of internal interactions
maintained afterwards, and, consequently, the observed
steady downhill character of the transition has an en-
tropic origin. The precise nature this entropic force is
not clear. The backward A→B transitions have qualita-
tively similar kinetic suggesting that this feature is not
due to the properties of the A and B-DNA forms, but
results from the speciﬁc setup of simulations.

In the backward A→B transitions, the sequence of
events is inverted, that is, the sugar puckers quickly
switch to the North whereas the rmsd’s and the groove
widths need sometimes many nanoseconds to reach sta-
tionary B-DNA values. Such kinetics does not depend
upon the amount of water added and it is slower than in
earlier reported AMBER simulations45,48. The apparent
reason is that during the B→A transition a large num-
ber of metal ions enter the major groove when it is still
wide. A high ion concentration in the major groove is
one of the factors that supposedly stabilize the A-DNA
conformation31,32. In contrast, when the trajectory is to
be started from the canonical A-DNA, the major groove
is narrow from the beginning, and very long equilibration
period should be necessary for the same number of ions
to reach optimal positions.

The possibility of B↔A transitions in longer and
shorter DNA fragments has been checked in a series of
simulations summarized in Fig. 3. The foregoing re-
sults suggested that the B→A transitions in a water drop
are mainly driven by electrostatic interactions between
counterions and backbone phosphates across the major
groove. A characteristic A-form major groove can be
formed starting from eight base pairs and, as seen in
Fig. 2c, its length in a dodecamer A-DNA is between for
and ﬁve nucleotides. One could expect, therefore, that
B→A transitions would progressively become more dif-
ﬁcult as the DNA is shortened. All trajectories shown
in Fig. 3 started from B-DNA with the lowest degree
of hydration used in Table I. The number of Na+ and
the size of the water drop were changed according to the
DNA chain length. As expected, relatively rapid B→A
transitions are observed in the original dodecamer and

its longer derivatives.
In contrast, the transition did
not occur in shorter fragments. The hexamer always
remained in a typical B-DNA conformation with high
rise and negative inclination. The octamer and decamer
fragments exhibited dynamics somewhat similar to that
of the dodecamer, with accumulation of Na+ ions in the
major groove and noticeable compression of the DNA
structure, however, the B→A transition did not occur.

6

Moreover, one of the terminal base pairs in the decamer
was broken, with water bridges formed between the two
nucleotides, which apparently helped to move closer the
opposite phosphate strands in the major groove. This
eﬀect was reproduced in a repeated run with hydrogen
bonds in terminal base pairs enforced by weak additional
restraints. The last observation suggested that the three
shorter fragments in Fig. 3 would not go to A-form even
in much longer dynamics.

Based upon the described qualitative character of DNA
dynamics, one can consider two main physical factors as
the possible driving forces of the B↔A transition under
low hydration. First, water tends to reduce its contact
surface with vacuum and forms a spherical drop forcing
the DNA fragment to shrink. This force can be con-
sidered as surface tension or as a particular case of the
hydrophobic eﬀect, with vacuum in place of a nonpolar
solvent. The second factor is the increased concentration
of Na+ ions, which reduces the water activity. These two
alternatives were checked in additional simulations under
modiﬁed conditions. To check separately the role of the
surface tension, the counterion eﬀects were suppressed by
discharging the DNA fragment and next running dynam-
ics without counterions. The partial charges of OP atoms
were reduced by by 0.5 eu and two long trajectories were
computed starting from the canonical B-DNA structure
under the lowest and the highest hydration, respectively.
The DNA structures sampled in both these simulations
turned out to be similar. These were slightly underwound
B-DNA conformations with the average twist around 30◦.
Under the low hydration the duplex looked slightly com-
pressed, but no signs of a B→A transition could be no-
ticed.

The eﬀect of the high counterion concentration upon
the water activity was separately checked in two simu-
lations with added NaCl. Earlier it was reported that
high NaCl does not cause B→A transitions in conven-
tional simulations with periodical boundaries32. To make
a more stringent test, here the NaCl concentration was
increased under the midway hydration as estimated in
Table I.
It was hoped that under such conditions an
increased salt concentration can produce a clear qualita-
tive eﬀect upon the dynamics. The initial A and B-DNA
states in a water shell of 600 molecules were modiﬁed by
replacing 66 randomly chosen water molecules with 33
Na+ and 33 Cl− ions. After that, 66 water molecules
were added to maintain the earlier hydration level. The
eﬀective concentration of Na+ was thus raised from 2M
to 5M. The two systems were re-equilibrated with the
standard protocol and long trajectories were computed
to obtain either A→B or B→A transition. In contrast
to the tests in Table I, here an A→B transition was ob-
tained after about 13 ns dynamics as shown in Fig. 4.
The dynamics exhibited in this ﬁgure is typical of the
A→B transitions described above although its kinetics
are much slower than those in Table I. The second tra-
jectory was similarly long, but only B-DNA structures
were sampled.

FIG. 4: A dynamics of a B→A transition in a 600 water molecule drop with increased NaCl concentration. For details, see
the legend to Fig. 2.

In the animations of these trajectories, progressive
crystallization of NaCl was seen, with large blocks of typ-
ical cubic NaCl lattice found in the major DNA groove
in the end of both trajectories. Addition of NaCl is
supposed to stimulate A→B transitions in ﬁber DNA
crystals70. Moreover, NaCl crystallization occurs in DNA
ﬁbers at 75% relative humidity if the salt content is above
6% of the DNA weight70, which gives 4.8M eﬀective con-
centration of NaCl according to the reported water/DNA
adsorption curves71. One may note, therefore, that the
overall eﬀect of the added salt in our simulations qual-
itatively agrees with experiments. The observed shift
towards the B-form may be caused by the NaCl crystal-
lization either directly, by forcing the major groove to
open, or indirectly, by pushing water out from the major
groove together with some free Na+ ions. In any case,
however, these results suggest that it is not the water ac-

tivity reduced by ions that causes the B→A transitions
in small drops.

The last simulations suggest that B→A transitions are
induced by a united eﬀect of the limited water shell and
counterions, and not by one of these factors considered
separately. A simple and attractive mechanism that ac-
counts for all the above results is as follows. The B→A
transition is caused by direct electrostatic interactions
between mobile metal cations and phosphate groups in
the opening of the major DNA groove. When the lo-
cal cation concentration exceeds a certain critical value,
the inter-phosphate repulsion is inverted to attraction.
A similar idea is long discussed in the context of DNA
bending72,73,74 and it was earlier proposed by Cheatham
and Kollman as one of the possible mechanisms respon-
sible for stability of the A-form31,32. The strong inter-
phosphate attraction immediately results in local DNA

bending and, eventually, in a B→A transition at the op-
posite side of the double helix. When the length of the
major groove exceeds one helical turn the apparent bend
becomes uniform shrinking. The role of the limited water
shell consist in pushing the counterion cloud surround-
ing DNA inside the diameter of the double helix. The
counterions avoid loosing their hydration shells and are
forced to come closer to DNA. The surface tension at the
drop boundary plays a certain role, but it is the reduced
overall space available for counterions that seems more
important. This simple model explains well our results,
and below we consider why and how it may work in other
conditions as well.

Concluding Discussion

Clariﬁcation of the detailed mechanisms involved in
the DNA polymorphism is an important challenge for
rapidly progressing computational methods in molecular
biophysics75. Here, for the ﬁrst time, reversible B↔A
transitions were obtained in silico in a simulated titra-
tion experiment by smooth variation of water content.
The environment conditions used were not earlier en-
countered in experiments, nevertheless, the qualitative
features found seem credible and likely to exist in analo-
gous experimental conditions. First, the computed pat-
tern of DNA transformations is physically sensible and
agrees with known experimental trends, notably, as re-
gards the principal eﬀect of the amount of bound water.
Second, these calculations give the most accurate cur-
rently possible prediction of the true properties of DNA
fragments in small water drops. Really, the Cornel at al.
force ﬁeld54 was earlier shown to produce DNA dynam-
ics in good agreement with experiments75. Its parame-
ters were ﬁtted with small molecule data only, and they
were never speciﬁcally adjusted for periodical boundary
conditions.
In our case, no artiﬁcial interactions are
introduced, while those between periodical images are
eliminated52. There are all reasons to believe, therefore,
that our simulations reproduce correctly the dynamics of
DNA transformations in such unusual conditions.

Qualitatively, the results obtained here agree with ear-
lier studies. Cheatham and Kollman were the ﬁrst to
obtain an A→B transformation in pure water, and sta-
ble A-DNA dynamics in 85% EtOH31,45. Visual inspec-
tion of the reported A-DNA snapshots76 shows that our
structures are quite similar to those in EtOH as regards
the width of the major groove, preferred positions of Na+
ions, and a B-like character of the DNA termini, which
gives the molecule a strong apparent bend to the major
groove. Moreover, the reported stabilization of A-DNA
in EtOH31 required that the molecule was ﬁrst covered
by water and then by EtOH as an outer shell. The ne-
cessity of such double phase hydration was conﬁrmed by
Sprous et al.48. Although water and EtOH could mix in
dynamics, it seems evident that, in order to be stable in
simulations, the A-form should be contained in a small

8

water shell. Cheatham and Kollman showed also that
a B→A transition can be provoked by placing polyca-
tionic ligands to the major groove between the opposite
phosphate strands32. Our results conﬁrm that the accu-
mulation of positively charged counterions in the major
groove of B-DNA is, perhaps, the major driving force of
this transition.

Although one cannot exclude that the A↔B transi-
tions in diﬀerent conditions are due to radically diﬀerent
mechanisms, it is attractive to consider the possibility
that the electrostatic model outlined above in fact oper-
ates in all such cases. This model is obviously transfer-
able from water drop to DNA in ﬁbers under diﬀerent
humidity. One can argue, tough, that the computed A-
DNA systematically diﬀers from the canonical and single
crystal A-DNA fragments by a very narrow major groove.
However, the major groove in the A-DNA conformations
available in NDB19 varies so strongly that this parame-
ter can hardly be considered as a well deﬁned attribute of
the A-form. It is possible also that the parameterization
of Na+ ions in the Cornell et al.
force ﬁeld54 underes-
timates its binding to water with respect to negatively
charged atoms. In our dynamics, correct canonical ma-
jor groove width was observed during transitions as long
as Na+ ions kept their ﬁrst hydration shells and avoided
direct contacts with the phosphate groups.

Another defect of the computed A-DNA consists in the
strong B-philicity of the termini accompanied by bend-
ing to the major groove. These two features are mutu-
ally related because it is long known that the bound-
aries between A and B-forms are bent77. This de-
fect, however, is only apparent because it qualitatively
agrees with experimental data. The B-philicity of DNA
ends has to be assumed when A↔B transitions in so-
lution are considered78. Moreover, many single crystal
A-DNA structures appear smoothly bend to the major
groove when analyzed with the Curves program67, with
this trend being particularly evident for complete helical
turns38,79,80. In our simulations, these features are just
accentuated due to the excessively narrow major groove,
which requires stronger bending, and also because our
sequences are not A-philic as in all single crystal A-DNA
fragments.

The solution A↔B transitions caused by non-polar or-
ganic solvents can also be interpreted in terms of the
above electrostatic model. For this purpose it is suﬃ-
cient to imagine what would happen if our water drops
were put in EtOH, for instance. The water activity in-
side the drop is strongly reduced by DNA itself and its
In inﬁnite water, the activity coeﬃ-
counterion shell.
cient grows with the distance from the double helix and
becomes close to one outside the counterion cloud, that
is at around 10 ˚A from DNA. EtOH is easily mixable
with normal water, but not with the low activity wa-
ter near DNA. This argument can be illustrated by the
above discussed crystallization of NaCl in the DNA envi-
ronment at concentrations much below its standard sol-
ubility limit. The water molecules would leave the drop

and go to EtOH until the outer water activity becomes
equal to that inside the drop. In other words, the wa-
ter activity in the added nonpolar phase determines the
size of the drop and, consequently, the state of the A↔B
equilibrium. That is why B↔A transition curves in dif-
ferent solvents converge when water activity is used as
parameter34. More polar solvents like MetOH and ethy-
lene glycol do not cause B→A transitions possibly be-
cause they solvate counterions rather than push them
inside the double helix.

Both the apparent B-philicity of the DNA ends and
the chain length dependence of the B→A transitions
observed in our simulations agree with experiments in
solution16,17,78. Another salient feature nicely repro-
duced is the cooperative character of the transition, with
the minimal length of the cooperative fragment of around
one helical turn. This cooperativity is not caused by the
sugar pseudorotation barrier because during B→A tran-
sitions the sugars switch last. Instead it is conditioned
by the A-DNA geometry and the character of the elec-
trostatic interactions in the major groove. In the A-DNA

9

major groove the phosphate of the nth base pair is posi-
tioned against that of the (n-8)th. These eight base pairs
represent the minimum DNA length that is to be me-
chanically involved if the transition is caused by a force
applied between these groups. The positive energy of
this mechanical deformation should be compensated by
the negative electrostatic energy of solvent cations sand-
wiched between the phosphates. One step of such ”elec-
trostatic sandwich” is probably insuﬃcient, and octamer
DNA should not generally go to the A-form. However,
already in a nanomer the sandwich length is increased
by one while the deformation energy is increased only
by a fraction of the initial gap. Therefore, the energetic
balance is progressively shifted in favor of A-form as the
chain length is increased. In long DNA, the boundary
between the A and B-forms has higher energy because
the energy gap of the initial octamer remains eﬀectively
shared between the two opposite boundaries. The fore-
going qualitative pattern exactly corresponds to the one
dimensional Ising model of cooperative transitions15.

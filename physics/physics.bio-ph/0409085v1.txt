Counterion distributions at charged soft membranes are studied using perturbative analytical and
simulation methods in both weak coupling (mean-ﬁeld or Poisson-Boltzmann) and strong coupling
limits. The softer the membrane, the more smeared out the counterion density proﬁle becomes and
counterions pentrate through the mean-membrane surface location, in agreement with anomalous
scattering results. Membrane-charge repulsion leads to a short-scale roughening of the membrane.

The study of charged colloids and biopolymers faces a
fundamental problem: In theoretical investigations, the
central object which is primarily computed is the charge
density distribution in the electrolyte solution adjacent
to the charged body [1]. Experimentally measurable ob-
servables are typically derived from this charge distribu-
tion. For example, the force between charged particles
follows from the ion density at the particle surfaces via
the contact-value theorem. Likewise, the surface tension
and surface potential are obtained as weighted integrals
over the ion distributions. It has proven diﬃcult to mea-
sure the counterion distribution at a charged surface di-
rectly because of the small scattering intensity. Notable
exceptions are neutron scattering contrast variation with
deuterated and protonated organic counterions [2] and
local ﬂuorescence studies on Zinc-ion distributions us-
ing X-ray standing waves [3]. Clearly, direct comparison
between theoretical and experimental ion distributions
(rather than derived quantities) is desirable as it provides
important hints how to improve theoretical modeling.

In a landmark paper the problem of low scattering in-
tensity was overcome by anomalous X-Ray scattering on
stacks of highly charged bilayer membranes [4]. Anoma-
lous scattering techniques allow to sensitively discrimi-
nate counterion scattering from the background, and a
multilayer consisting of thousands of charged layers gives
rise to substantial scattering intensity. Since then, simi-
lar techniques have been applied to charged biopolymers
[5, 6] and to oriented charged bilayer stacks, where the
problem of powder-averaging is avoided [7].

However, scattering on soft bio-materials brings in a
new complication, not considered theoretically so far:
soft membranes and biopolymers ﬂuctuate in shape, and
thus perturb the counterion density proﬁle. Comparison
with standard theories for rigid charged objects of sim-
ple geometric shape becomes impossible. Here we ﬁll this
gap by considering the counterion-density proﬁle close to
a planar charged membrane which exhibits shape ﬂuctu-
ations governed by bending rigidity. As main result, we
derive for a relatively stiﬀ membrane closed-form expres-
sions for the counterion density proﬁle in the asymptotic
low and high-charge limits which compare favorably with

our simulation results. These parametric proﬁles, which
exhibit a crucial dependence on the membrane stiﬀness,
will facilitate the analysis of scattering results since they
allow for a data ﬁt with only a very few physical parame-
ters. In previous experiments, a puzzling ion penetration
into the lipid region was detected but interpreted as an
artifact [4]. We show that ion penetration indeed occurs
and is due to the correlated ion-membrane spatial ﬂuc-
tuations. The electrostatic coupling between membrane
charges and counterions not only modiﬁes the counte-
rion density proﬁle but also renormalizes the membrane
roughness: the short-scale bending rigidity is reduced,
charged membranes become locally softer.

The Hamiltonian H = Hm + He of the membrane-
counterion system consists of the elastic membrane part
Hm and the electrostatic part He. We discretize the
NL square
membrane shape on a two-dimensional NL ×
lattice with lattice constant a and rescale all lengths by
the Gouy-Chapman length µ = 1/2πqℓBσm according to
r = µ˜r, where σm = QM/N 2
La2 is the projected charge
density of the membrane and ℓB = e2/4πε0εkBT is the
Bjerrum length (e is the elementary charge, ε the dielec-
tric constant). Parametrizing the membrane shape by
the height function h(x), the elastic membrane energy in
harmonic approximation reads in units of kBT [8]:

where ∆ is the Laplace operator, K0 is the bare bend-

harmonic potential. The electrostatic energy accounts
for the interaction of N counter-ions of valence q and
M membrane charges of valence Q, related by the elec-
troneutrality condition QM = qN ,

1/2 beneath the membrane sur-
face which is impenetrable to the point-like counterions.
This way we can largely neglect charge-discreteness ef-
fects [10] and concentrate on shape-ﬂuctuation eﬀects.
In most of our simulations the membrane ions are mobile
and move freely on the membrane lattice, with a packing
fraction ζ = M/N 2
L. For the long-ranged electrostatic
interactions we employ laterally periodic boundary con-
ditions using Lekner-Sperb methods [9]. To minimize
discretization and ﬁnite-size eﬀects, the number of lat-
tice sites NL and the rescaled strength of the harmonic
potential ˜g are chosen such that the lateral height-height
correlation length of the membrane ξ0
obeys the inequal-

= (4K0/˜g)1/4
NL˜a[8]. Simulations are run
k
for typically 106 Monte Carlo steps using 100 counter-
ions and 100 membrane ions. In Fig.1 we show two sim-
ulation snapshots. The counter-ions form in the weak
coupling limit (Ξ = 0.2, Fig.1.a) a diﬀuse dense cloud
while in the strong coupling limit (Ξ = 1000, Fig.1.b,
note the anisotropic rescaling) the lateral ion-ion dis-
tances are large compared to the mean separation from
the membrane. Pronounced correlations between mem-
brane shape ﬂuctuations and counterion positions are ob-
served in both snapshots.

corresponds to protrusion degrees of freedom of single
lipids. Yet a distinct softening mechanism, eﬀective at
intermediate wavelengths, is due to electrostatic corre-
lations eﬀects [18, 19, 20], which is missed by standard
mean-ﬁeld approaches. Experimentally, both membrane
stiﬀening [21] and, for highly charged membranes, soften-
ing has been observed [22]. To distinguish eﬀects due to
membrane charges and counterions we calculate via ex-
act enumeration and within harmonic approximation the
membrane propagator Kmn for a charged discrete mem-
brane without counterions. The roughness ratio from
this analytical calculations is shown as a solid line, and
again cross-checked by MC simulations without counte-
rions (ﬁlled symbols). The good agreement with the MC
data containing counterions shows that the softening ef-
fect is mostly due to the repulsion of charges on the mem-

FIG. 3: Ratio of simulated and bare roughness ˜ξ⊥/ ˜ξ0
⊥ as a
function of Ξ for ζ = 0.028 and ˜ξ0
⊥ = 0.3184 (open squares)
and ˜ξ0
⊥ = 0.3184
(open triangles) and ˜ξ0
⊥ = 1.2111 (open diamonds). The solid
lines and solid symbols are analytical and MC results without
counterions (ζ = 0.028 lower branch, ζ = 0.25 upper branch).
The inset shows the ratio ˜ξ⊥/ ˜ξ0
⊥ as a function of the packing
fraction ζ for Ξ = 0.2 (squares) and Ξ = 1000 (triangles),
˜ξ0
⊥ = 0.3184 in both cases.

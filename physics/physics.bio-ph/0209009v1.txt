Abstract: We discuss the origin of two classes of germinal centers that have been observed
during humoral immune responses: Some germinal centers develop very well and give rise
to a large number of high aﬃnity antibody producing plasma cells. Other germinal center
reaction are very weak and the output production is practically absent. We propose an
explanation for this nearly all-or-none behavior of germinal center reactions: The aﬃnity
of the seeder B-cells to the antigen is the critical parameter that determines the fate of
the germinal center reaction. This hypothesis is veriﬁed in the framework of a space-time
simulation of germinal center reactions.

1 Introduction

Germinal centers (GC) are an important part of the humoral immune response [1, 2, 3, 4].
They generate new plasma cells that produce antibodies of high aﬃnity to a speciﬁc anti-
gen. This aﬃnity maturation process allows the organism to adapt its antibody repertoire
to new antigens, to form the memory B cell compartment, and to react to antigens more
eﬃciently compared to an immune response using B-cells from the repertoire only.

Typically, GCs are found in lymph nodes or in the spleen.

In reaction to primary
immunization some B-cells from the repertoire are activated and become sensible to pro-
liferation progression factors. These B blasts (centroblasts) migrate towards the primary
follicle system.
In the environment of follicular dendritic cells and T cells they start a
process of monoclonal expansion [5, 6, 7]. After about three days the centroblast pop-
ulation reaches about 12000 cells due to an extremely short cell cycle time of 6-7 hours
[8, 9, 10]. During this early phase of the GC reaction a reduction of diversity has been
observed where those B cells of higher aﬃnity to the antigen have been preserved [6]. This
has been interpreted as an early antigen-dependent preselection process of un-mutated B
cells. The phase of monoclonal expansion is believed to be followed by a phase of frequent
somatic hypermutation [4, 11], giving rise to a great variety of diﬀerent antibodies that are
encoded in the blasts. These cells start to diﬀerentiate to centrocytes that are no longer
in cell cycle but express large numbers of antibodies [10, 12]. Centrocytes have initiated a
process of apoptosis [13]. They are rescued from apoptosis in dependence on an interaction
with antigens that are presented on the FDCs [14, 15, 16]. All centrocytes that are not
selected by such an interaction process die – and this is the large majority. Only positively
selected centrocytes get the chance to interact with T cells and, if again selected, to further
diﬀerentiate into antibody producing plasma cells or memory cells [17, 18, 19, 20]. As this
selection process is believed to depend on the aﬃnity of antibodies and antigen, the GC
reaction provides an antibody optimization procedure.

GCs show some very interesting properties. Among those are the separation of cen-
troblasts and centrocytes into two zones, the dark and the light zone [4, 10, 21]. The
origin of those zones has been discussed before in the framework of a stochastic space-time
model for the GC reaction [22]. Another property is the nearly all-or-none behavior of
GCs [16, 23]. GC reactions of moderate intensity have rarely been observed. The reaction
is either successful (concerning aﬃnity maturation and number of produced output cells)
or strongly suppressed. The reason for this behavior has not been resolved until now.
Especially, the all-or-none behavior could not be reproduced in a previous modeling work
[24].

One suggestion goes back to the starting point of the GC reaction, the originally acti-
vated B cells [23]. The authors speculate that the mouse colony in their (pathogen-free)
experiment may undergo a qualitatively and quantitatively diverse background immune re-
sponse, i.e. leading to a diversiﬁcation of the B cell repertoire between individuals. The
consequence would be that the seeder cells of the GC reaction would have diﬀerent aﬃni-

2

ties to the antigen, implying diﬀerent GC reactions. This leads us to the hypothesis that
the quality of GC seeder cells determines the fate of the GC reaction [25, 26, 27] and, in
addition, may imply the all-or-none behavior of GCs. In the present article this hypothesis
is discussed in the framework of a previously introduced stochastic space-time model for
the GC reaction [22].

2 Methods

The model providing the basis of the analysis has been introduced in all details before [22].
Therefore, only those model elements are pointed out in details that are of direct relevance
in the present context. The basic concepts are only shortly summarized in the following.
Cells are represented on a ﬁxed, equidistant, cubic, and two dimensional lattice. Each
cell occupies exactly one node of the lattice. All cells can move on the lattice with some
velocity, which is anti-proportional to the cell radius. The movement is undirectioned and
restricted by the space available on the lattice. Each cell is of speciﬁc type (centroblast or
centrocyte) which determines their possible actions: Centroblasts can divide. Each division
allows a somatic hypermutation to occur with probability 0.5. They also can diﬀerentiate
to centrocytes provided that the diﬀerentiation process has been activated before. This
happens if the centroblast binds a certain amount of signal molecules, which is secerned
by the FDCs and diﬀuses over the lattice. Such a non-local interaction process turned out
to be crucial for the establishment of the dark zone [22]. Centrocytes die by apoptosis and
are then eliminated from the lattice. They may be rescued by an interaction with antigens
on FDCs, which becomes possible when centrocytes and FDCs are in direct contact on the
lattice and provided that the aﬃnity of the presented antibodies to the antigen is strong
enough. Rescued centrocytes can further diﬀerentiate to plasma- or memory-cells (output
cells) or restart to proliferate (i.e. become centroblasts again). Output cells leave the GC
by diﬀusion. The parameters that have been used here and that have been determined
before [22] are summarized in Tab. 1.

Most important is the description of aﬃnity between antigen and antibodies. The
model uses the traditional shape space concept [28]. The dimension of the shape space is
thought to represent phenotype properties of the antibodies. The aﬃnity to the antigen
reaches a maximum at the shape space position corresponding to optimal complementarity.
A mutation (only those of phenotypical relevance are counted) is represented by a jump
to a neighbor point in the shape space. The principle of aﬃnity neighborhood [27] ensures
that the aﬃnity may be increased by a sequence of somatic hypermutations. One may
think of climbing up an aﬃnity hill. However, key mutations, that has been frequently
discussed (especially for immunization with (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP) [16]) are
not easily covered by this concept. Therefore, the outcome of the analysis will have to be
interpreted in this context.

The quality of a B cell is deﬁned by its distance to the antigen (i.e. to the optimal B
cell clone). The distance is calculated by the number of (phenotypically relevant) somatic

3

hypermutations that are necessary to reach the antigen position in the shape space. The
number of mutations is denoted by mutation-distance in the following. This corresponds
to the deﬁnition of a 1-norm on the shape space which is assumed to have four dimensions.
Using this norm the aﬃnity of antibody and antigen is quantitatively described by a
Gaussian function which is centered at the antigen position Φ0 in the shape space [27].
In the following this concept is used to describe the eﬃciency of the GC reaction in a
qualitative and quantitative way. At ﬁrst, the quality of a GC reaction is measured by the
success of the aﬃnity maturation process. To this end the fraction of high aﬃnity output
cells (the sum of plasma and memory cells) resulting from the GC reaction is analyzed.
High aﬃnity means that the antibody binds the antigen with a probability of more than
30%. Secondly, the number of resulting output cells (summed over the whole GC reaction)
is a good measure for the quantitative eﬃciency of the GC reaction.

However, the above notion of B cell quality hides an intrinsic ambiguity. Let the
antigen be at position Φ0 = (3, 3, 3, 3) and let the seeder cells have a mutation-distance
of 5. The outcome of the GC reaction depends on the exact position of the seeder cell,
which may have the initial position Φ1 = (8, 3, 3, 3) or Φ2 = (6, 5, 4, 4). Assuming the
mutations to occur randomly [16, 29], the probabilistic weights p(Φ) of both seeder cells
to ﬁnd the antigen position Φ0 considerably diﬀers: p(Φ1) = 1/256 and p(Φ2) = 90/256.
The diﬀerence is due to the number of possible permutations in the sequence of mutations.
In other words, there exist more combinatorial possibilities for the mutations that all lead
to the same target Φ0. This ambiguity is mirrored in the GC eﬃciency (quality and
quantity of output cells, see Fig. 1). Less probable mutation paths induce GC reactions of
smaller eﬃciency. However, at least the fraction of high aﬃnity output cells saturates for
more probable mutation paths. In order to ensure a well-deﬁned mutation distance, only
seeder cells that reach the antigen on a mutation path of maximum probability will be
taken into account. The results have been cross-checked using mutation paths of moderate
probability.

Using the thus deﬁned model concepts we initiate GC reactions with various types of
seeder cells. The seeder cells are placed at random positions in the FDC network. The
mutation-distance is varied between 0 and 12. Mutation-distances to the antigen of more
than 12 seem to be unphysiological [30, 31]. Only a cutout of the shape space in the
neighborhood of the antigen (which is ﬁxed at Φ0 in the shape space) is considered: The
range of each shape space dimension is 0 ≤ Φi ≤ 10. B cells that leave this shape space
area are considered to have vanishing aﬃnity to the antigen. The positions of the seeder
cells are listed in Tab. 2. As we use a stochastic model, the GC reactions are repeated
with diﬀerent initializations of the random number generator. Each result is presented by
showing 13 GC reactions, the average value, and one standard deviation.

3 Results

We ﬁnd a clear correlation of the total number of output cells produced during the GC
reactions and the mutation-distance of the seeder cells that initiate the GC reaction (see
Fig. 2). If the seeder cells are already high aﬃnity B cells, the GC reaction is rather stable
and produces a large amount of high aﬃnity output cells. With increasing mutation-
distance the number of output cells is reduced in a sigmoidal-like functional dependence.
For mutation-distances of more than 6 the outcome of the GC reaction becomes critical
and for more than 9 the GC reaction is not able to generate a relevant amount of output
cells.

The GC reaction breaks down in a relatively narrow range of the seeder cell mutation-
distance to the antigen. This points towards an all-or-none development of GC reactions
which depends on the seeder cell quality (at least concerning the output quantity). This
interpretation is veriﬁed by counting the numbers of GC reactions that lead to the produc-
tion of diﬀerent numbers of output cells (see Fig. 3). This analysis is based on the same
number of GC reactions for each type of seeder cells. Indeed, GCs preferentially produce
large or nearly vanishing amounts of output cells. Small or moderate amounts are rare
events.

Note, that these results remain basically unaltered considering seeder cells with mu-
tation paths to the antigen of moderate (instead of maximum) probabilistic weight (see
Tab. 2, Fig. 2 and 3). However, the break-down of the GC reaction is slightly shifted to
seeder cells of higher quality.

The output quality is correlated to the seeder cell quality in a very analogous way (see
Fig. 4). The GC reaction produces a stable and large fraction of high aﬃnity output cells
for high aﬃnity seeder cells. For seeder cells with larger mutation-distances the fraction of
high aﬃnity output decreases. The correlation becomes instable for very large mutation-
distances. This is due to the small number of produced output cells in this regime. Large
statistical ﬂuctuations obscure the correlation of output and seeder cell quality. However,
plotting the number of GC reaction leading to some fraction of high aﬃnity output cells
(see Fig. 5) shows that the all-or-none behavior of GCs is clearly found for the output
quality as well. Note, that this result is again not aﬀected by switching to seeder cells with
mutation paths to the antigen of moderate (instead of maximum) probabilistic weight.

An interesting observation of the GC reactions for various types of seeder cells is that
the dark zone is established in all GC reaction in a very similar way – independently of the
seeder cell quality. The dark zone is always depleted around day 8 of the reaction (data
not shown). This implies that the initial phase of the GC reaction is not inﬂuenced by
the seeder cell aﬃnity to the antigen. This initial phase includes the phase of monoclonal
expansion and even the ﬁrst days of the phase of somatic hypermutation and selection
(what we have called the primary optimization phase [27]). It is only afterwards when the
selection of centrocytes becomes the dominant process of the GC reaction, that the seeder
cell aﬃnity to the antigen is a critical parameter. We observe a huge sensitivity of the total

5

GC life time on the seeder cell quality, which varies from 12 to 27 days. This implies that
if the B cell quality is not substantially enhanced during the ﬁrst phase of the reaction,
the GC B cell population rapidly dies out within 4 to 5 days – a behavior that has been
observed in experiment as well [32, 26].

It is important to verify that the aﬃnity maturation process was, indeed, unsuccessful in
rapidly dying GCs. This is best shown by considering the number of recycled centroblasts
(i.e. re-proliferating centroblasts that have been positively selected at least once) after 10
days (a representative time point) of the reaction. If a centrocyte is positively selected it
will restart to proliferate with a high probability [27] and therefore the number of recycled
cells is a good measure for the success of the aﬃnity maturation process. For seeder cells
with a mutation-distance of more than 8 this value remains below 20 and reaches 150 for
seeder cells with mutation-distance of 3.

Let us have a deeper look at the regime where the GC reaction becomes critical. This
is the case for seeder cells with mutation-distances from 6 and 7. The same analysis as
performed in Figs. 3 and 5 is repeated taking into account the corresponding GC sim-
ulations only. The result is shown in Fig. 6. The all-or-none behavior seen before has
disappeared. The distribution of GCs with respect to the fraction of high aﬃnity output
cells is peaked at 65 % and ﬂat for smaller fractions. In the case of the number of output
cells the distribution of GC reactions is clearly peaked at about 50 cells in a Gaussian-like
shape. This is the result expected if the all-or-none behavior of GCs is indeed correlated to
the seeder cell quality. If, considering a small window of mutation-distances for the seeder
cells, the all-or-none behavior still appeared as it did in Figs. 3 and 5, the reason for the
all-or-none behavior would have to be looked for somewhere else in the GC dynamics.

4 Discussion

The present analysis has revealed that the seeder cell quality (measured as the mutation-
distance to the optimal clone) determines the fate of the GC reaction and is responsible for
the all-or-none development of GC reactions as observed in experiments. The eﬃciency of
the GC reaction has been measured quantitatively and qualitatively considering number
and aﬃnity of the produced output cells. This result implies that the repertoire of B cells
in an organism determines whether the immune system may respond with GC reactions in
an eﬃcient way or not. If the repertoire is reduced under some threshold, the probability
of a successful GC reaction may become critically small for some speciﬁc antigens.

However, there are some model assumptions that should be revisited. At ﬁrst, the
model is two-dimensional. In three dimensions the number of B cells in a fully developed
GC is substantially larger. Therefore, we expect a shift of the curves in Fig. 2 and 4 to
higher mutation-distances of the seeder cells. This shift is nontrivial and diﬃcult to be
estimated quantitatively because the translation from two to three dimension may also
change the interaction frequency of centrocytes and FDCs.

In view of the shape space concept a possible role of key mutations may aﬀect the

6

results even when the key mutations are in a cold spot as in the case of NP [16]. However,
one may expect that the existence of key mutations would even intensify the all-or-none
behavior of GCs because the B cells are confronted with an additional critical process,
namely to ﬁnd the key mutation or not. Therefore, one may suspect that the sigmoidal
function in Fig. 2 may even become steeper. From this perspective the present results
show that the existence of key mutations is not necessary to understand the all-or-none
development of GC reactions [16]. The latter follows already within a quasi-continuous
aﬃnity maturation concept.

The analysis is based on the assumption that the seeder cells are homogeneously dis-
tributed with respect to the mutation-distances to the antigen. This assumption is not
essential for the outcome provided that not all activated B cells that give rise to a GC re-
action always have the same mutation-distance to the antigen (see Fig. 6). It is reasonable
to expect that the mutation-distance of activated B cells is basically a random parameter.
Indeed, it has recently been found for T cell-dependent primary immune responses to NP,
that high and low aﬃnity B lymphocytes are equally suitable to induce GC reactions [33].
The aﬃnity of B cells to the antigen diﬀered by a factor of 40 in those measurements.
Therefore, we expect that deviations from our assumption of homogeneity will remain
suﬃciently small not to aﬀect our interpretation of the results.

An important outcome of the analysis is that the seeder cell quality does not aﬀect
the initial phase of the GC reaction (compare also [33]). One may have suspected that
the GC reaction simply doesn’t start if the seeder cells have subthreshold aﬃnity to the
antigen [25] (it is assumed that the aﬃnity is suﬃcient to activate some naive B cells). This
possibility is not excluded by the present analysis, as there may be some process, which
is not included in the model, but which is crucial for the initiation of the GC reaction.
However, our computer experiment shows that the all-or-none behavior can be understood
on the level of the eﬃciency of GC reactions without postulating an additional process
during the initiation of the GC reaction.

This result is in accordance with observations of T cell independent GC reactions
[23, 26]. Here, it has been found that GCs develop normally in absence of T cell help.
Even the dark and light zones are established [26]. As T cells are believed to be of
great importance for the selection process (especially to inhibit apoptosis of centrocytes
[34, 35, 36]) the author claimed that the initial phase is basically independent of T cell
help. In the present context, this implies that provided that B cells have been activated by
the antigen, they may induce a GC reaction independently of their aﬃnity to the antigen
(note that assuming a preselection process of un-mutated B cells [6], this statement applies
to positively pre-selected B cells). In a later phase of the GC reaction the T cell help is
crucial for centrocytes to survive and, consequently, the already well established GCs are
rapidly depleted without T cells [23, 26]. The same happens in the present simulations
but for a diﬀerent reason: While in T cell independent GC reactions the selection process
cannot start at all, bad quality seeder cells may still allow for a weak selection process,
which is, however, insuﬃcient to achieve a successful aﬃnity maturation process. In both

7

scenarios – in T cell independent GCs and for GCs initiated by low quality seeder cells –
the GCs die out because of a failing selection procedure.

The diﬀerences of GC responses to two similar (but non-identical) peptides (PS1CT3
and G32CT3) have been examined [25]. The authors found that the intensity of a GC
reaction is dependent on the used peptide and, consequently, dependent on the quality
of the initially activated B cells. The results found here support these ﬁndings, and, in
addition, specify the character of this dependence: The seeder cell quality induces an
all-or-none behavior of the GC reaction intensity.

Table 1: Summary of all model parameters. The values have been determined using corre-
sponding experimental data [22]. Note, that all given rates are the physiological ones which
enter with an additional factor of ln(2) into the model. The symbols correspond to those used

Figure 1: The fraction of high aﬃnity output cells and the number of output cells resulting
from GC reactions for seeder cells with a distance of 5 mutations to the optimal clone at
position (3, 3, 3, 3) in the shape space but for diﬀerent stochastic weights p of the corresponding
mutation paths. The seeder cells are at position (8, 3, 3, 3) (diamonds, p = 0.0039), (6, 5, 3, 3)
(circles, p = 0.12), (5, 4, 4, 4) (squares, p = 0.23), and (5, 5, 4, 3) (triangles, p = 0.35). The
corresponding average values from 13 GC reactions (ﬁlled circles) are shown with one standard
deviation (gray area). The output cell quality grows and saturates for higher stochastic weights,
which is less clear for the number of output cells.

Table 2: The positions Φ1, Φ2, and Φ3 in the shape space of the three seeder cells that initiate
the GC reaction. The antigen is at position Φ0 = (3333). The mutation-distance is varied
between 0 and 12. The mutation-paths are grouped according to their probabilistic weight
deﬁning sets of used seeder cells.

Figure 2: The number of output cells resulting from 338 GC reactions for diﬀerent seeder cell
qualities. The results are shown for mutation paths of maximum (169 triangles) and moderate
(169 circles) probability. Filled triangles and circles denote the corresponding average values,
respectively. The dark and light gray area denotes one standard deviation for each type of
mutation path. The number of output cells grows with the seeder cell quality in a sigmoidal-
like way. More probable mutation paths shift the sigmoidal function to seeder cells of lower
quality.

15

Figure 3: The number of GC simulations for diﬀerent numbers of output cells (the exponent
of 2 is shown on the abscissae). The seeder cells are at a mutation-distance in the range of 0
and 12. The data are based on 26 simulations for each mutation-distance (= 338 simulations).
The result is shown for mutation paths of maximum (dark gray) and moderate (light gray)
probability, separately. The all-or-none behavior of GC reactions is clearly reproduced.

16

Figure 4: The fraction of high aﬃnity output cells resulting in 338 GC reactions for diﬀerent
seeder cell qualities. The results are shown for mutation paths of maximum (triangles) and
moderate (circles) probability. Filled triangles and circles denote the corresponding average
values, respectively. The dark and light gray area denotes one standard deviation for each
type of mutation path. The output cell quality decreases for lower seeder cell quality. For bad
quality seeder cells the GC reaction becomes unstable. For the most probable mutation path
the seeder cell quality necessary for a successful GC reaction is slightly lowered.

17

Figure 5: The number of GC simulations leading to diﬀerent fractions of high aﬃnity output
cells (in %). The seeder cells are at a mutation-distance in the range of 0 and 12. The data are
based on 26 simulations for each mutation-distance (= 338 simulations). The result is shown
for mutation paths of maximum (dark gray) and moderate (light gray) probability, separately.
Again, the all-or-none behavior of GC reactions is clearly reproduced.

18

Figure 6: The number of GC simulations leading to diﬀerent fractions of high aﬃnity output
cells (in %) and to diﬀerent numbers of output cells (the exponent of 2 is shown on the
abscissae). Only those simulations are shown that started with seeder cells in a critical distance
to the optimal mutant (6 and 7). The data are based on 13 simulations for each mutation-
distance (= 26 simulations). The result is shown for mutation paths of maximum probability.
The all-or-none behavior of GC reactions found in Fig. 5 and 3 disappears. The distribution of
GCs with respect to the number of output cells even becomes Gaussian-like.

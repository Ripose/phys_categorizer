Abstract

×

We study the space of all compact structures on a two-dimensional square
lattice of size N = 6
6. Each structure is mapped into a vector in N -
dimensions according to a hydrophobic model. A principle component anal-
ysis is performed on the set of all these vectors. Previous work has shown
that the designabilities of structures are closely related to the distribution of
the structure vectors in the N -dimensional space. In particular, highly des-
ignable structures are found to be in the low density regions. We show that
the distribution of structure vectors is very nonuniform and that the highly
designable structures are distributed very diﬀerently from the ensemble. The
designability of a structure can be eﬀectively estimated by projecting the
structure vector onto the principle eigenvectors. We also demonstrate that
the eigenvalues of the structure space are very close to the Fourier modes of
the structure vectors.

I. INTRODUCTION

∼

Proteins fold into speciﬁc structures to perform their biological function. Despite the
huge diversity in their functions, evolutional paths, structural details, and sequences, the
1000) of folds (“topology”).1–6 This
vast majority of proteins adopt only a small number (
observation intrigued a number of authors and lead to the concept of designability.1,7–10 The
designability of a structure is deﬁned to be the number of sequences that have that structure
as their unique lowest-energy state.10 It has been shown in various model studies that struc-
tures diﬀer drastically in their designability; a small number of highly designable structures
emerge with their associated number of sequences much larger than the average.11,10,12–16
Highly designable structures are also found to possess other protein-like properties, such
as thermodynamic stability,10 fast folding kinetics,9,17 and tertiary symmetry.8,10,18 These
results suggest that there is a designability principle behind nature’s selection of protein
folds–these small number of folds were selected because they are readily designed, stable
against mutations, and thermodynamically stable.

Why are some structures more designable than others? How do we identify highly des-
ignable structures? Finkelstein and co-workers argued that certain motifs are easier to sta-
bilize and thus more common because they either have lower (e.g. bending) energies or have
usual energy spectra over random sequences.1,19,20 Govindarajan and Goldstein suggested
that the topology of a protein structure should be such that it is kinetically “foldable”.9,11,21
More recently, it was noted that the answer lies largely in the distribution of structures in a
suitably deﬁned structure space–highly designable structures are in the low density regions
of the structure space.12,13 In particular, within a hydrophobic model Li et al. showed that
the distribution of structures is very nonuniform and that the highly designable structures
are those that are far away from other structures.12 However, identifying those highly des-
ignable structures is still a tedious task, which requires either enumeration or suﬃciently
large sampling of both the structure and the sequence spaces, making studies of large systems
diﬃcult.

In this paper, we investigate the properties of the structure space of the hydrophobic
model of Li et al., using the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). We show that the distri-
bution of the structures is far from being uniform and that highly designable structures are
distributed very diﬀerently from the ensemble. Based on these ﬁndings, we propose a very
eﬀective method of estimating the designability of a structure using only its components on
the principle eigenvectors.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we review the hydrophobic
model and the designabilities of structures. In Section III we discuss the methods and the
results of PCA applied to the structure space. In Section IV we relate the designability of a
structure to its projections onto the principle axes. In Section V we discuss an approximation
to PCA–the Fourier transform of the covariance matrix, and we study the subset of cyclic
structures. In Section VI we compare the structure space with another constrained random
ensemble. We conclude in Section VII.

II. THE HYDROPHOBIC MODEL

· · ·

Here we brieﬂy review the hydrophobic model of Li et al.12 and the designabilities of
structures. Sequences are made of two types of amino acids, H and P. Each sequence
hi, i = 1, 2,
, N, is represented by a binary string or vector, with hi = 0 for P-mer and
hi = 1 for H-mer. We take the sequence length N = 36, so there are 236 sequences. Each
of these sequences can fold into any one of the many compact structures on a 6
6 square
lattice (Fig. 1). There are 57, 337 such compact structures unrelated by rotation and mirror
symmetries. In the hydrophobic model, the only contribution to the energy for a sequence
folded into a structure is the burial of the H-mers in the sequence into the core of the
, 36,
structure. So if one represents a structure by a binary string or vector, si, i = 1, 2,
with si = 0 for the surface sites and si = 1 for the core sites (Fig. 1), the energy can be
written as:

· · ·

×

E =

hisi,

N

−

X
i=1

where hi is the sequence vector.

The designability of a structure is deﬁned as the number of sequences that have the
structure as their unique lowest-energy state. To obtain an estimate for designabilities of
structures, we randomly sampled 40, 000, 000 sequences from the sequence space and found
the unique lowest-energy structure, if any, for each of them. In Fig.2, we plot the histogram
for the designabilities, i.e. number of structures with a given designability. Note that we have
normalized designability so that the maximum designability is one. In this paper, we deﬁne
highly designable structures to be the top one percent of designable structures (structures
with nonzero designability), which means xx structures with a designability larger than 0.47.
In the hydrophobic model, both sequences and structures have their representations in a
36-dimensional Euclidean space (a hypercube) as points. In this representation the lowest-
energy state of a sequence is its nearest structure point.12 In this space, the designability of
a structure is the number of sequences that fall within the Voronoi polytope of the structure
(Fig. 3). Structures in the lower density regions have larger Voronoi polytopes and higher
designability. Understanding of the way the structure points are distributed in this 36-
dimensional space can help us to address questions concerning the designability. In the next
section, we examine the distribution of the structure points via the method of PCA.

III. PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS

First, let us note that while sequences are uniformly distributed in the 36-dimensional
hypercube, structures are distributed on a 34-dimensional hyperplane because of the follow-
ing two geometrical constraints. The ﬁrst constraint on structure vectors comes from the
fact that all compact structures have the same number of core sites:

(1)

(2)

The second constraint is that since the square lattice is a bipartite lattice all structure
vectors satisfy

Next, let us deﬁne the covariance matrix of the structure space as

symmetry of Ci,j is that Ci,j = C37−i,37−j. This is due to the reverse-labeling symmetry

then the reverse string (s36, s35,

Ci,j is plotted in Fig. 4. Note that Cij is peaked along the diagonal and decays oﬀ-
diagonally with short range correlations. This feature reﬂects a general property of compact
self-avoiding walks–if a monomer is in the core (on the surface) the neighboring monomers
along the chain have enhanced probability to be in the core (on the surface), so we expect it
only, i.e.
to be rather generic. Another feature of Cij is that it is almost a function of
Cij ≈
), barring some small ends and parity eﬀects. We also expect this feature of
approximate translational invariance to be generic beyond our 6
6 lattice model studied
here. In comparison, we show in Fig. 5 the covariance matrix from the highly designable
structures. One clear feature is that it decays oﬀ-diagonally faster than that of the average
structures, which has been attributed to the fact that highly designable structures tend to
have more frequent transitions between core and surface sites.12,15,22

Cij is diagonalized to obtain the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors. The
36 eigenvalues of the structure space λi, i = 1, 2,
, 36, are shown in Fig. 6. The two zero
eigenvalues (λ1 = λ2 = 0) result in the two constraints (2) and (3), with the corresponding
1)i, i = 1, 2,
, 36, respectively. The rest of the
eigenvectors being vi = 1 and vi = (
34 nonzero eigenvalues range smoothly from zero to one, making any further dimensional
reduction not so obvious. For comparison, the 36 eigenvalues of the uniformly distributed
sequence space are the same (λ = 1/4). (It is easy to show that the covariance matrix
for the sequence space is Cij = δij/4.) On the other hand, a uniform distribution on the
34-dimensional hyperplane where the structure points reside would result in 34 identical
eigenvalues of 360/1377

By using the rotation matrix Rij that diagonalizes the covariance matrix Cij of the

In Fig. 7 we show the distribution of projections yi on two principle axes i = 16 and i = 36,
along with the corresponding Gaussian distribution Eq. (6). In Fig. 8, the same distributions
are shown together with the projections for highly designable structures. It is clear that the
highly designable structures have a distinctly diﬀerent distribution from that of the whole
structure space.

The above results suggest that one may identify highly designable structures by using
the projections on the principle axes. Since designability depends also on the distribution
of sequences, we construct the quantity

IV. FOURIER SPACE CYCLIC STRUCTURES

In this section we discuss the covariance matrix in the Fourier space and show that in
our case its digonal elements are good approximations to the eigenvalues obtained via PCA
discussed in the previous section. Since the Fourier analysis is identical to PCA in the
case where there is translational invariance, we study the subset of cyclic structures the
covariance matrix of which is translationally invariant and we compare the results with that
of all structures.

Next, we study the subset of cyclic structures. A cyclic structure is a structure with
its two ends being the nearest neighbors in the lattice. One can think of a cyclic structure
as a loop with one bond broken. Since there are N = 36 ways to break a bond along a
loop, the structure strings of the cyclic structures originated from the same loop are cyclic
permutations of each other. Thus, the covariance matrix of the subset of all cyclic structures
36 cyclic
is translationally invariant. In our system of 6
×
structures. The covariance matrix Ccyclic(j, j′) for cyclic structures is shown in Fig. 13. The
Fourier transform of Ccyclic(j, j′) is shown in Fig. 14(a)–it is a diagonal as expected. The
diagonal elements are shown in Fig. 14(b), together with the eigenvalues of covariance matrix
from all structures. They are very close to each other.

V. A CONSTRAINT RANDOM ENSEMBLE

To what extend the covariance matrix of the structure space contains the information
about the structures’ designabilities? We performed a comparative study of an artiﬁcial

using a third order Markov process in the following way. For each string tj, j = 1, 2,
, 36,
the ﬁrst point t1 is generated according to the probability P (t1 = 1) =< s1 >, where
< s1 > is the fraction of the true structure strings with s1 = 1. The second point t2
is generated according to a transition probability P (t1 →

P (tj−3tj−2tj−1 →
extracted from the true structure strings. The Markov strings generated this way are, by
construction, short range correlated and translationally invariant barring the end eﬀect. For
every Markov string generated, we also put the reverse string in the pool, if the string is not
the reverse of itself. The ensemble of these strings gives a very similar covariance matrix and
a very similar set of eigenvalues as those of the true structure space, as shown in Figs. 15 and
16. We then calculated the designabilities of these “structures” using Eq. (1) by uniformly
107 random binary sequences. The histogram of the designabilities (Fig. 17)
sampling 5
looks very similar to that of the true structures (Fig. 2). The covariance matrix for highly
designable Markov strings also show a reduction of the width of the diagonal peak (Fig. 18).
(Eq. (8)) for the artiﬁcial structures,
Next we constructed the designability estimator
using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their covariance matrix. The quantity
is plotted
versus designability in Fig. 19 for all the artiﬁcial structures with non-zero designability. One
sees an even better correlation than that of the true structures. These results suggest that a
considerable amount of information about the designability is contained in the correlations
between neighboring sites in the structure strings or in general in the covariance matrix.
The designability estimator, Eq. (8) does a better job in the case where the structure strings
are short range correlated only.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have analyzed the property of the structure space of 6

6 lattice structures using PCA.
The structures are distributed very non-uniformly in high dimensions. Highly designable
structures distribute diﬀerently from the ensemble. The local density of the structure space
can be approximated by a multi-variable Gaussian. The designability of a structure can be
estimated by projecting its vector onto the principle axes. Since this method of estimating
structure designability is based only on the overall distribution of structures, it can be a
useful tool in cases where there is not enough computational power to enumerate the whole
structure space and calculate the designability. To obtain an accurate enough covariance
matrix requires only a uniform sampling of the structure space.

×

In would be revealing to see how much of the current method, which is developed based
on a lattice hydrophobic model, can be applied to real proteins. One could use the exposure
level of residues to the solvent in building up the structure vectors. Current method deals
with structure strings of a ﬁxed length which is also the dimension of the structure space.
Since real proteins have diﬀerent lengths, there is a need for a certain scaling method to
handle them all together. Our model study shows that both of the covariance matrices

7

for all structures and for the highly designable structures are approximately translationally
invariant and short range correlated, and that Fourier analysis can be eﬀectively used. This
suggests that the role of the chain length can be treated in some straightforward way.

16. Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for the structures generated by the Markov model

(circles) and that of the true structure space (pluses).

17. Number of structures with a given designability versus designability for the struc-
ture strings randomly generated using the Markov Model. The data is generated by
107 binary sequence strings in the sequence space. The des-
uniformly sampling 5
ignability of each structures is normalized by the maximum designability.

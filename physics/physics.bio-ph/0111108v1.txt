Abstract

A ﬂat membrane with given shape is displayed; two points in the membrane
are randomly selected; the probability that the separation between the points have
a speciﬁc value is sought. A simple method to evaluate the probability density is
developed, and is easily extended to spaces with more dimensions.

1 Introduction

A most common geometrical problem encountered in exact and natural sciences (engi-
neering, physics, chemistry, biology, etc) is: given a surface with ﬁnite area and deﬁnite
(l) that these
form, and randomly choosing two points in it, ﬁnd the probability density
points have a prescribed separation l.

P

To see the relevance of the subject consider the following example taken from biology:
a live membrane is infected at some spots, and the progress of the infection is suspected
to depend on the mutual separation between the infected points. A knowledge of the
1)mean, and the mean squared
mean separation lmean, the mean inverse separation (l−
2)mean between points in the membrane, all depend on the probability
inverse separation (l−
density, and are crucial to an analysis of the process.

In this note we ﬁnd the functions

(l) for three ﬁnite surfaces widely dealt with: the
circle, the square, and the rectangle. From these examples the method for obtaining
(l) for other surfaces is trivially inferred. The method can also be easily extended to

three-dimensional spaces, such as spherical drops, or parallelepipeds.

2 Circular membranes

In a plane disk with diameter δ two points A, B are randomly chosen. We want the
(l) dl that the separation between the points lies between l and l + dl. The

Our ﬁrst concern is: having chosen a point A in the (inﬁnite) euclidian plane, next
randomly choosing another point B also in the plane, we seek the probability that their
separation have a value l. That probability clearly is proportional to the measure of the
locus of B – the circle with center A and radius l – so the locus has measure 2πl. However,
since neither the ﬁniteness of the disk nor its shape were taken into account, the analysis
of the problem is still incomplete.

We have to examine all possible line segments entirely embedded in the disk. As a
matter of fact, the symmetry of the disk permits restrict the study to segments aligned
in just one direction; we choose the vertical direction, for deﬁniteness.

In ﬁgure 1 we note that the upper tip B of a vertical segment with length l has

probability density that their separation be l; the normalization condition now reads

We initially consider the segments with length l < a; in this case the symmetries of
the square allow reduce our study to the segments with slope lying between φ = 0 and
φ = π/4, as is seen in the ﬁgure 3.

The locus of the upper tip B of a segment with slope φ and length l is a rectangle with
area

Taking into account all slopes in the range [0, π/4] we write

4 Rectangular membranes

We assume a rectangle with sides a and b < a; to investigate separations l between points
in the rectangle we need now distinguish three diﬀerent possibilities, depending on the
value of l relative to a and b. See ﬁgure 5.

In all cases the angular probability density

(l, φ) is similar as before,

The symmetries of the rectangle permit restrict the study to segments with slope from

1 b/l, and the integration gives

(l > a).

5 Discussion

The problem of investigating separations between points in a given space [1] recen
received a strong and unexpected stimulus coming from cosmology [2]; more speciﬁcally
from the so-called cosmic crystallography, which aims to unveil the shape of the univ
[3] – [19].

P

The algorithm formerly used in the present note to ﬁnd the various probability
(l) closely followed that of cosmologists. However, it soon became evident
sities
a new approach was imperative to circumvent the long calculations arising from
algorithm, when applied to spaces diﬀerent from balls.
The idea of using normalized probability densities

(l) greatly simpliﬁes the task

obtaining mean quantities concerning separations; e.g., we have

opposite corners of the square, and corner regions are small in comparison with the whole
square.

In ﬁgure 6, corresponding to the rectangle, we again note that both

In extending the present note to three-dimensional euclidean spaces one should replace
the overall multiplicative factor l in the probability density with a factor l2; this is because
the locus of the points that are at a distance l from a ﬁxed point in three-space is a two-
dimensional sphere, whose area 4πl2 increases with l2.

It is shown that at low temperatures and moderate electron dephasing the electron transmission
function reveales a structure containing information about donor/acceptor sites eﬀectively partici-
pating in the electron transfer (ET) processes and primary pathways of electrons tunneling through
molecular bridges in macromolecules. This important information can be obtained as a result of
analysis of experimental low temperature current-voltage characteristics for chosen molecules.

It has been estabilished that molecular ET is essen-
tially a combination of nuclear environment ﬂuctuations
and electron tunneling. Due to the large distances be-
tween donor and acceptor, ET is mostly provided by in-
tervening molecular bridges, giving rise to a set of in-
termediate states for the electron tunneling1. The ex-
pression for the ET rate including both electronic and
nuclear factors was ﬁrst proposed by Marcus3−5 and can
be written as follows:

KET = KelKnνn .

(1)

Here, Kel is the electron transmission coeﬃcient, Kn is
the nuclear transition or Franck-Condon factor, and νn
is the eﬀective nuclear vibration frequency.

The enormous size of biological molecules makes cal-
culations of Kel extremely difﬁcult6−12.
In this pa-
per a simple approach is proposed which enables us to
show that some intrinsic characteristics of the intramolec-
ular ET such as pathways of tunneling electrons and
donor/acceptor coupling to the bridge at diﬀerent values
of tunnel energy E. can be obtained in experiments on
low-temperature electrical transport through the corre-
sponding molecules. These data may be available under
moderate electronic dephasing13−15, when the structure
of electron transmission function containing the desired
information is not completely washed out.

Existing theories of electronic transport

through
macromolecules are mostly based on a very simple model
simulating both electrodes by semi-inﬁnite tight-binding
chains attached to the ends of the molecule which is also
simulated as a single tight-binding chain of sites13−18
Here we adopt a resembling model to analyze the elec-
tronic transport through realistic macromolecules includ-
ing donor, bridge, and acceptor subsystems. However, we
take into account that donor and acceptor subsystems are
complex and include many sites providing eﬀective cou-
pling to the bridge, as well as to the electrodes connected
with the molecule.

To simplify further calculations we assume coherent
electron tunneling through the macromolecule to be the
predominant transport mechanism. Correspondingly we
treat the electron transport through the molecule as a

sequence of tunnelings between potential wells. Each
well represents one atomic orbital of the donor-bridge-
acceptor system. Within this approach, any atom is
represented by a set of sites corresponding to its states
and we do not distinguish between sites corresponding
to the same atom and those corresponding to diﬀerent
atoms. For further simpliﬁcation we assume than in-
traatomic hopping integrals are smaller that interatomic
ones, therefore we consider electron transfer between dif-
ferent sites as its tunneling between diﬀerent atoms.

Assume that sites ”i” are associated with those atoms
of the bridge which have a strong coupling to the donor,
and sites “j” are associated with atoms interacting with
the acceptor. Then we can treat any site “i” as the origin
of a chain along which an electron moves from donor to
acceptor, and any site “j” as the end of the chain. Thus,
we have a set of chains (pathways) for an electron mov-
ing along the bridge. In further analysis, we concentrate
on the case when the chains weakly interact so we can
consider them separately.

We simulate the donor/acceptor subsystems as sets
of semi-inﬁnite tight-binding homogeneous chains. Each
chain is attached to a site of donor/acceptor which can
be eﬀectively coupled to the bridge. As before we as-
sume that the chains do not interact with each other.
The adopted model does not enable us to carry out
a proper treatment of coupling of electrodes to the
molecule at metal-molecule-metal junctions which is a
nontrivial problem19−22. Here, however, we concentrate
on the analysis of electron tunneling through the bridge.
It seems reasonable to conjecture that in the molecules
with complex donor and acceptor subsystems this pro-
cess do not strongly depend on details of coupling of the
electrodes to the donor/acceptor due to a comparatively
large size and complicated structure of these subsystems.
In the following calculations we start from an eﬀective
tight-binding Hamiltonian for a single chain included into
the bridge:

Hef f = H0 + H1 + HD + HA .

(2)

Here ﬁrst two terms describe the chain itself, and their
matrix elements between states |k > and |l > correspond-

ing to the k-th and l-th sites are given by:

(H0)kl = αkδkl ;

(H1)kl = Vkl ,

(3)

where Vkl= 0 when k = l and only states associated with
valence electrons are considered. The diagonal matrix
elements αk are ionization energies of electrons at sites
k, while Vkl = Vlk includes both direct and exchange en-
ergy contributions for an electron to transfer between the
k-th and l-th sites. Remainig terms represent self-energy
corrections arising due to the coupling of the donor (HD)
and acceptor (HA) to the bridge:

Here, Dmi and Ajn are respectively coupling strengths

ǫm,n and γm,n are the ionization energies of electrons at
the corresponding donor/acceptor sites, and the nearest-
neighbor hopping integrals for the chains. Summation in
Eqs. (4) and (5) is carried out over all donor/acceptor
sites coupled to the bridge.

Due to the presence of the self-energy corrections the
eigenvalues of the eﬀective Hamiltonian (2) include imag-
inary parts which represent broadening of the bridge en-
ergy levels Ei originating from the coupling of the bridge
to the donor and acceptor systems. The energy levels are
broadened further if include scattering processes in the
bridge which are not considered here.

An electric tunneling current I ﬂowing from donor to
acceptor through the bridge in the presence of a small
voltage V applied across the bridge has the form23

I =

∞

−∞

dE T (E)[f (E − µ1) − f (E − µ2)] ,

(6)

where f (E) is the Fermi function; and the chemical po-
tentials µ1 and µ2 are determined by the equilibrium
Fermi energy of the bridge EF and the eﬀective voltage
V across the bridge17, i.e.

µ1 = EF + (1 − η) eV ;

µ2 = EF − ηeV.

Here the parameter η characterizes how the voltage V is
divided between the two ends of the bridge. The electron
transmission function is given by the formula

T (E) = 2

∆i|Gij |2∆j .

(7)

Xi,j

The summation in (7) is carried over states |i > at
the entrances to the bridge and states |j > correspond-
ing to the exits from the bridge to the acceptor subsys-
tem, therefore contributions from all possible pathways
are contained here. The quantities ∆i,j are imaginary

We see that the dependence of the electron transmission
function on energy is determined by the contributions
from diﬀerent donor/acceptor sites, as well as from the
Green’s function matrix elements corresponding to dif-
ferent chains included into the bridge subsystem.

(8)

We can easily arrive at the ﬁrst approximation for
Gij neglecting the broadening of the bridge energy levels
which originates from its coupling to the donor/acceptor
and taking into account only nearest neighbors (NN) and
next nearest neighbor (NNN) couplings. Assuming this,
we can introduce a new notation for the nonzero hop-
ping integrals, i.e., Vk,k+1 = Vk−1,k = βk and Vk,k+2 =
Vk−2,k = γk.

Then we can calculate the Green’s function matrix
elements for a given chain which makes a start at the
site ”i” and ends at the site ”j”, applying a diagram
technique similar to that described in detail for the NN
approximation24. We present our chain of sites as a graph
Γij, using the following rules :

(i) Any site included in the chain corresponds to a

(ii) A term E − αk corresponds to a loop attached to

graph vertex.

the vertex “k”.

(iii) A hopping integral Vkl corresponds to an edge orig-
inating at the vertex “k” and ending at the vertex “l”.

As a result we obtain the graph shown below:

Now we consider all possible cycles for this graph and
deﬁne the value of a cycle O as the product of values of
the edges included into the cycle multiplied by the num-
ber of the edges connecting the ﬁrst and last sites with a
negative sign. When the numbers of the edges associated
with the paths from the ﬁrst site to the last one and back
diﬀer, we have to multiply by the maximum number of
edges. When the cycle includes only one vertex, its value

2

is deﬁned as E − αk where k is the number of the ver-
tex. Then we introduce the deﬁnition of a cyclic term
which is a set of cycles including all sites of the system.
The value of the cyclic term is equal to the product of
the cyclic values of these cycles. The sum of all possible
cyclic terms Or gives us the cyclic value Θ(Γij ) of the
graph Γij. An expression for the matrix element Gij can
be obtained in the form:

Here, the summation is carried out over all possible path-
ways along the chosen chain. The value of P σ
ij equals the
product of all edges along the pathway. When the path-
way includes all vertices of the graph Γij we have

Gij =

Xσ

P σ

Θ(Γij)

.

Pij =

Yk=i

(9)

(10)

When the pathway does not include some vertices, this
produces diﬀerent values for the corresponding Pij . For
example, when the electron is being transferred from the
site l to the site l + 2, passing the intermediate site l + 1,
the corresponding edge is equal to (E − αl+1)γl. Conse-
quently, we obtain for the pathway which excludes this
vertex:

Pij = (E − αl+1)γl

βk .

(11)

Yk=i, k6=l,l+1

We can easily write the expressions for Pij when path-
ways pass more than one vertex. To obtain the corre-
sponding result, we must bear in mind that, within the
NNN approximation, omitted vertices cannot be adjacent
ones. Suppose that we pass the sites l + 1 and m + 1,
then

Pij = (E − αl+1)(E − αm+1)γlγm

k=i; k6=l,l+1, k6=m,m+1,

Following a similar way we can get explicit expressions
for all terms in the numerator of (9). The expression (9)
can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed if we assume that NNN
couplings are small compared to NN couplings (γk ≪ βl
for any pair of values k, l). Then we obtain the following

where Θ0(Γij ) is the cyclic value of the graph calculated
within the NN approximation.

The Green’s function matrix elements (9) have poles

which can be detemined by solving the equations

Θij(Γ) = 0.

These poles correspond to energy states of a given chain.
They do not coincide either with the ionization energies
for the sites included to the chain or with the energy
levels of the bridge in whole. The set of these energy
states characterizes the chosen chain (pathway) and dif-
ferent chains have diﬀerent sets of energy states. When
we take into account the broadening of the energy levels
due to the coupling of the bridge to donor/acceptor and
due to electron dephasing processes at the bridge, the
singularities of the Green’s function matrix elements are
converted to the peaks of ﬁnite height and width.

To apply the described method of calculation of the
matrix elements Gij for a real macromolecule we have
to determine which atomic orbitals have to be used to
arrange a chain between the sites ”i” and ”j” coupling
respectively to the donor and acceptor. A simple way
to choose suitable orbitals can be based on the results
of the extended Huckel calculations for the considered
molecule, which give us hopping integrals Vkl
for all
possible combinations of atomic orbitals. We can sep-
arate out the chain connecting sites ”i” and ”j” includ-
ing there those sites ”k” which provide the largest values
for Vk,k+1 (i ≤ k ≤ j − 1), and we have to repeat this
procedure for all combinations of sites at the entrance to
the bridge and at the exit from it. As a result we obtain
the set of chains which represent the bridge, and we can
use our result (9) to calculate analytically the Green’s
function matrix elements corresponding to these chains.
It follows from the obtained results (7), (9) that the
electron transmission function contains important infor-
mation concerning intramolecular electron transfer. Un-
der low temperatures and moderate electronic dephasing
T(E) can exhibit series of peaks. Their location is de-
termined with contributions from donor/acceptor sites
predominating in the ET at a given interval of tunnel-
ing energy E, and with the energy spectrum of a chain
of sites connecting them. When the tunneling energy E
takes on a value close to ǫk,l or to one of the poles of the
Green’s function the corresponding term in (7) can sur-
pass all remaining terms. Thus, for diﬀerent values of E
diﬀerent donor/acceptor sites and diﬀerent pathways can
predominate in the electron transfer through the bridge.
The structure of T(E) can be revealed in the low tem-
perature current-voltage characteristics for the electronic
transport through the molecular bridges (6). As a result
of numerical simulations of electrical transport through
porphyrin-nitrobenzene macromolecules it was shown25
that at low temperatures current-voltage curves can ex-
hibit a step-like behavior which disappears as the temper-
ature raises (see Fig.1). This originates from a step-like
character of Fermi distribution functions at low tempera-
tures along with the ”comblike” structure of the electron
transmission function T(E). At a given voltage V the dif-
ference of Fermi functions in (6) takes on nonzero values
only in the interior of a certain energy range including
EF . The size of the range is proportional to the magni-
tude of the voltage V applied across the bridge. There-
fore the magnitude of the current I at a given voltage is

(14)

3

determined by the contributions of peaks of T(E) located
in this energy range. When the applied voltage increases,
this enhances the width of the relevant energy interval.
The tunneling current I abruptly changes when an
extra peak of the electron transmission function ap-
pears in the interior of the relevant energy range where
f (E − µ1) − f (E − µ2) diﬀers from zero. Widths of
the plateaus are equal to the distances between adja-
cent peaks of T (E) and magnitudes of sudden changes in
the current correspond to the heights and shape of these
peaks. At higher temperatures Fermi distribution func-
tions lose their step-like character and the plateous are
washed out. Another reason for the structure of T (E)
(and I − V curves) to be eroded is the electronic phase-
breaking eﬀect which arises in complex molecules due to
stochastic ﬂuctuatious of the ion potential. We conjec-
ture, however, that at low temperatures the electronic
dephasing eﬀects could be reduced so that the structure
of T (E) could be revealed.

On these grounds we believe that experiments on elec-
tronic transport through macromolecules at low temper-
atures (T ∼ 1K) could be useful to obtain an additional
information upon characteristics of the intramolecular
electron transfer. Namely, comparing the structure of
the electron transmission function reconstructed on the
basis of experimental I − V curves with that obtained as
a result of calculations using (7), (9), we can make con-
clusions concerning actual primary pathways of electrons
through intramolecular bridges, as well as sites of the
donor/acceptor subsystems involved in the ET process
at diﬀerent values of the tunneling energy.

The model adopted in the present work provides us
with the results suitable for a quantitative comparison
with the results of proposed experiments even avoiding
a proper and reliable calculation of some parameters in-
cluded in the expression (6) for the tunneling current such
as the equilibrium Fermi energy of the bridge, and the
eﬀective voltage V applied across the bridge. The lack of
information about proper values of EF and V produces
an uncertainty in the location of the origin at the ”volt-
age” axis in the Fig. 1, so we cannot identify steps of
the I − V curves separately. Nevertheless, changes in the
values of EF and V do not inﬂuence the electron trans-
mission function, therefore the structure of series of the
peaks remains ﬁxed. This enables us to identify some se-
ries of peaks analyzing sequences of widths of successive
steps of the current-voltage curves. Such analysis also
can give reasonable estimations for the EF and V for the
chosen molecule.

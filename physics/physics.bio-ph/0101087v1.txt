We formulate a kinetic model of DNA replication that quantitatively describes recent results
on DNA replication in the in vitro system of Xenopus laevis prior to the mid-blastula transition.
The model describes well a large amount of diﬀerent data within a simple theoretical framework.
This allows one, for the ﬁrst time, to determine the parameters governing the DNA replication
program in a eukaryote on a genome-wide basis. In particular, we have determined the frequency
of origin activation in time and space during the cell cycle. Although we focus on a speciﬁc stage
of development, this model can easily be adapted to describe replication in many other organisms,
including budding yeast.

Although the organization of the genome for DNA
replication varies considerably from species to species,
the duplication of most eukaryotic genomes shares a num-
ber of common features:

1) DNA is organized into a sequential series of replication
units, or replicons, each of which contains a single origin
of replication (Hand, 1978; Friedman et al., 1997).

2) Each origin is activated not more than once during the
cell-division cycle.

3) DNA synthesis propagates at replication forks bidirec-
tionally from each origin (Cairns, 1963).

4) DNA synthesis stops when two newly replicated re-
gions of DNA meet.

Understanding how these parameters are coordinated
during the replication of the genome is essential for elu-
cidating the mechanism by which S-phase is regulated in
eukaryotic cells. In this article, we formulate a stochastic
model based on these observations that yields a mathe-
matical description of the process of DNA replication and
provides a convenient way to use the full statistics gath-
ered in any particular replication experiment. It allows
one to deduce accurate values for the parameters that
regulate DNA replication in the Xenopus laevis replica-
tion system, and it can be generalized to describe replica-
tion in any other eukaryotic system. This type of model
has also been shown to apply for the case of RecA poly-
merizing on a single molecule of DNA (Shivashankar et
al, 1999). The model turns out to be formally equivalent
to a well-known stochastic description of the kinetics of
crystal growth, which allows us to draw on a number
of previously derived results and, perhaps equally im-
portant, suggests a vocabulary that we ﬁnd useful and
intuitive for understanding the process of replication.

KINETIC MODEL OF DNA REPLICATION

In the 1930s, several scientists independently de-
rived a stochastic model that described the kinetics of
crystal growth (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl,
1939; Avrami, 1939). The “Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-
Avrami” (KJMA) model has since been widely used by
metallurgists and other scientists to analyze thermody-
namic phase transformations (Christian, 1981).

In the KJMA model, freezing kinetics result from three

simultaneous processes:
1) nucleation, which leads to discrete solid domains.

2) growth of the domain.

3) coalescence, which occurs when two expanding do-
mains merge.

Each of these processes has an analog in DNA replica-
tion in higher eukaryotes, and more speciﬁcally embryos:
1) The activation of an origin of replication is analo-
gous to the nucleation of the solid domains during crystal
growth.

2) Symmetric bidirectional DNA synthesis initiated
(nucleated) at the origin corresponds to solid-domain
growth.

3) Coalescence in crystal growth is analogous to multiple
dispersed sites of replicating DNA (replication fork) that
advance from opposite directions until they merge.

In the simplest form of the KJMA model, solids nu-
cleate anywhere in the liquid, with equal probability
for all spatial locations (“homogeneous nucleation”), al-
though it is straightforward to describe nucleation at pre-
speciﬁed sites (“heterogeneous nucleation”), which would

1

correspond to a case where replication origins are speci-
ﬁed by ﬁxed genetic sites along the genome. Once a solid
domain has been nucleated, it grows out as a sphere at
constant velocity v. When two solid domains impinge,
growth ceases at the point of contact, while continuing
elsewhere. KJMA used elementary methods to calculate
quantities such as f (τ ), the fraction of the volume that
has crystallized by time (τ ). Much later, more sophis-
ticated methods were developed to describe the detailed
statistics of domain sizes and spacings (Sekimoto, 1991;
Ben-Naim and Krapivsky, 1996).

DNA replication, of course, corresponds to one-
dimensional crystal growth; the shape in three dimen-
sions of the one-dimensional DNA strand does not di-
rectly aﬀect the kinetics modeling. (In the model, repli-
cation is one dimensional along the DNA. The conﬁgu-
ration of DNA in three dimensions is not directly rele-
vant to the model but can enter indirectly via the nucle-
ation function I(x, τ ). For example, if, for steric reasons,
certain regions of the DNA are inaccessible to replica-
tion factories, those regions would have a lower (or even
zero) value of I.) The one-dimensional version of the
KJMA model assumes that domains grow out at veloc-
ity v, assumed to remain constant. The nucleation rate
I(x, τ ) = I0 is deﬁned to be the probability of domain
formation per unit length of unreplicated DNA per unit
time, at the position x and time τ . Following the analogy
to the one-dimensional KJMA model, we can calculate
the kinetics of DNA replication during S-phase. This re-
quires determining the fraction of the genome f (τ ) that
has already been replicated at any given moment during
S-phase. One ﬁnds

f (τ ) = 1

which deﬁnes a sigmoidal curve. (Eq. 1 assumes an inﬁ-
nite genome length. The relative importance of the ﬁnite
size of chromosomes is set by the ratio (fork velocity * du-
ration of S-phase) / chromosome length (Cahn, 1996). In
the case of the experiment analyzed in this paper, this ra-
10 bases/sec * 1000 sec / 107 bases/chromosome
tio is

10−3, which we neglect.)
A more complete description of replication kinetics
requires detailed analysis of diﬀerent statistical quanti-
ties, including measurements made on replicated regions
(eyes), unreplicated regions (holes), and eye-to-eye sizes
(the eye-to-eye size is deﬁned as the length between the
center of one eye and the center of a neighboring eye.)
The probability distributions may be expressed as func-
tions either of time τ or replicated fraction f . For exam-
ple, the distribution of holes of size ℓ at time τ , ρh(ℓ, τ )
can be derived by a simple extension of the argument
leading to Eq. 1:

ρh(ℓ, τ ) = I0τ

−I0τ ℓ.

From Eq. 2, the mean size of holes at time τ is

ℓh(τ ) =

1
I0τ

.

(3)

Determining the probability distributions of replicated
lengths (eye sizes) is complicated because a given repli-
cated length may come from a single origin or it may
result from the merger of two or more replicated regions.
Thus, one must calculate in eﬀect an inﬁnite number of
probabilities; by contrast, holes of a given length arise
in only one way (Ben-Naim and Krapivsky, 1996). One
can nonetheless derive a simple expression for ℓi(τ ), the
mean replicated length at time τ , from a “mean-ﬁeld”
hypothesis (Plischke and Bergersen, 1994): the probabil-
ity distribution of a given replicated length is assumed
to be independent of the actual size of its neighbor. One
can show that this mean-ﬁeld hypothesis must always be
true in one-dimensional growth problems, but not neces-
sarily in the ordinary three-dimensional setting of crys-
tal growth (Suckjoon Jun, private communication).
In
particular, if I(τ ) depends on space, one expects correla-
tions to be important. Using the mean-ﬁeld hypothesis,
we ﬁnd

ℓi(τ ) = ℓh(τ )

These expressions for ℓi(τ ) and ℓi2i(τ ) allow one to col-
lapse the experimental observations of ℓh, ℓi, and ℓi2i (the
mean eye-to-eye separation) onto a single curve. (See Fig.
3D, below.)

Finally, we can calculate the average distance between
origins of replication that were activated at diﬀerent
times during the replication process, which is just the
inverse of Itot, the time-integrated nucleation probability
per unit length:

Since the kinetics of DNA replication in any cell sys-
tem depends on two fundamental parameters, replication
fork velocity and initiation frequency, one of the princi-
pal goals of this kind of analysis is to derive accurate
values for these parameters, along with inferences about
any variation during the course of S-phase. As repli-
con size and the duration of S-phase depend on the val-
ues of these parameters, this information is indispensable
for understanding the mechanisms regulating S-phase in

APPLICATION OF THE KJMA MODEL TO DNA
REPLICATION IN X. LAEVIS

Recent experimental results obtained on the kinetics of
DNA replication in the well-characterized Xenopus lae-
vis cell-free system were used here to derive parameter
values for that particular system. In those experiments,
fragments of DNA that have completed one cycle of repli-
cation are stretched out on a glass surface using molecu-
lar combing (Bensimon et al., 1994; Michalet et al., 1997;
Herrick et al., 1999). The DNA that has replicated prior
to some chosen time t is labeled with a single ﬂuorescent
dye, while DNA that replicated after that time is labeled
with two dyes. The result is a series of samples, each of
which corresponds to a diﬀerent time t during S-phase.
Using an optical microscope, one can directly measure
eye, hole, and eye-to-eye lengths at that time. We can
thus monitor the evolution of genome duplication from
time point to time point, as DNA synthesis advances.
(See Fig. 1.)

Cell-free extracts of eggs from Xenopus laevis support
the major transitions of the eukaryotic cell cycle, includ-
ing complete chromosome replication under normal cell-
cycle control and oﬀers the opportunity to study the way
that DNA replication is coordinated within the cell cy-
cle.
In the experiment, cell extract was added at t =
2’, and S-phase began 15 to 20’ later. DNA replication
was monitored by incorporating two diﬀerent ﬂuorescent
dyes into the newly synthesized DNA. The ﬁrst dye was
added before the cell enters S-phase in order to label the
entire genome. The second dye was added at successive
time points t = 25, 29, 32, 35, 39, and 45’, in order to
label the later replicating DNA. DNA taken from each
time point was combed, and measurements were made
on replicated and unreplicated regions. The experimental
details are described elsewhere (Herrick et al., 2000), but
the approach is similar to DNA ﬁber autoradiography, a
method that has been in use for the last 30 years (Huber-
man and Riggs, 1966; Jasny and Tamm, 1979). Indeed
the same approach has recently been adapted to study
the regulatory parameters of DNA replication in HeLa
cells (Jackson and Pombo, 1998). Molecular combing,
however, has the advantage that a large amount of DNA
may be extended and aligned on a glass slide which en-
sures signiﬁcantly better statistics (over several thousand
measurements corresponding to several hundred genomes
per coverslip).
Indeed, the molecular combing experi-
ments provide, for the ﬁrst time, easy access to the quan-
tities of data necessary for testing models such as the one

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of labeled and combed
DNA molecules. Since replication initiates at multiple dis-
persed sites throughout the genome, the DNA can be dif-
ferentially labeled, so that each linearized molecule contains
alternating subregions stained with either one or both dyes.
The thick segments correspond to sequences synthesized in
the presence of a single dye (eyes). The thin segments cor-
respond to those sequences that were synthesized after the
second dye was added (holes). The result is an unambiguous
distinction between eyes and holes (earlier and later repli-
cating sequences) along the linearized molecules. Replication
is assumed to have begun at the midpoints of the thick se-
quences (dotted lines) and to have proceded bidirectionally
from the site where DNA synthesis was initiated (arrows).
Measurements between the centers of adjacent eyes provide
information about replicon sizes (eye-to-eye distances). The
fraction of the molecule already replicated by a given time,
f (τ ), is determined by summing the lengths of the thick seg-
ments and dividing that by the total length of the respective
molecule.

Generalization of the simple version of the KJMA
model

Analyzing the experimental results obtained on the ki-
netics of DNA replication in the in vitro cell-free sys-
tem of Xenopus laevis (Herrick et al., 2000; Lucas et al.,
2000), we found that the simple version of the crystal-
growth model needed to be generalized in a number of
ways:

1) Instead of assuming that the nucleation function I(τ )
has the form I(τ ) = I0 for τ
0, we allowed for an
arbitrary form I(τ ). Nucleation is believed to occur syn-
chronously during the ﬁrst half of S-phase in Drosophila
melanogaster early embryos (Shinomiya and Ina, 1991;
Blumenthal et al., 1974). Nucleation in the myxomycete
Physarum polycephalum, on the other hand, occurs in

≥

3

a very broad temporal window, suggesting that nucle-
ation occurs continuously throughout S-phase (Pierron
and Benard, 1996). Finally, recent observations suggest
that in Xenopus laevis, early embryos nucleation may oc-
cur with increasing frequency as DNA synthesis advances
(Herrick et al., 2000; Lucas et al., 2000). By choosing an
appropriate form for I(τ ), one can account for any of
these scenarios. Below, we show how measured quan-
tities may, using the model, be inverted to provide an
estimate for I(τ ).

2) The model assumes implicitly that the DNA analyzed
began replication at τ = 0, but this may not be so, for
two reasons:

i) In the experimental protocols, the DNA analyzed
comes from approximately 20,000 independently replicat-
ing nuclei. Before each genome can replicate, its nuclear
membrane must form, along with, presumably, the repli-
cation factories. This process takes 15-20 minutes (Blow
and Laskey, 1986; Blow and Watson, 1987; Wu et al.,
1997). Because the exact amount of time can vary from
cell to cell, the DNA analyzed at time t in the laboratory
may have started replicating over a relatively wide range
of times.

ii) In eukaryotic organisms, origin activation may be
distributed in a programmed manner throughout the
length of S-phase, and, as a consequence, each origin
is turned on at a speciﬁc time (early and late) (Simon et
al., 1999).

In the current experiment, the lack of information about
the locations of the measured DNA segments along the
genome means that we cannot distinguish between asyn-
chrony due to reasons (i) or (ii). We can however account
for their combined eﬀects by introducing a starting-time
distribution φ(t′), which is the probability—for whatever
reason—that a given piece of analyzed DNA began repli-
cating at time t′ in the lab. We assume that the distri-
bution is Gaussian, with unknown mean and standard
deviation, an assumption that will be justiﬁed by the ﬁts
to the data.

3) The models described above assumed that statistics
could be calculated on inﬁnitely long segments of DNA.
In the experimental approach, the combed DNA is bro-
ken down into relatively short segments (200 kb, typi-
cally). Although it is diﬃcult to account for this eﬀect
analytically, we wrote a Monte Carlo simulation that can
mimic such “ﬁnite-size” eﬀects. As we show below (Fig.
3D), we ﬁnd evidence that there is no spatial variation
in nucleation rates on scales less than 200 kb.

4) The experiments are all analyzed using an epiﬂuores-
cence microscope to visualize the ﬂuorescent tracks of

combed DNA on glass slides. The spatial resolution (
≈
0.3 µm) means that smaller signals will not be detectable.
Thus, two replicated segments separated by an unrepli-
cated region of size < 0.3 µm will be falsely assumed to
be one longer replicated segment. We accounted for this
in the simulations by calculating statistics on a coarse
lattice whose size equalled the optical resolution, while
the simulation itself takes place on a ﬁner lattice.

We can redo the analysis of the DNA kinetics for gen-

eral I(τ ). Eq. 1 then generalizes to

f (τ ) = 1

The other mean lengths, ℓi(τ ) and ℓi2i(τ ), continue to be
related to ℓh(τ ) by the general expressions given in Eqs.
4 and 5. In the experiment, one measures ℓh, ℓi, and ℓi2i
as functions of both τ and f . (Because of the start-time
ambiguity, the f data are easier to interpret.) The goal
is to invert this data to ﬁnd I(τ ). Using Eqs. 7 and 8,
we ﬁnd

Because τ (f ) increases monotonically, one can numeri-
cally invert it to ﬁnd f (τ ). From f (τ ), one can derive all
quantities of interest, including I(τ ).

Using the generalizations discussed above, we analyzed
recent results obtained on DNA replication in the Xeno-
pus laevis cell-free system. DNA taken from each time
point was combed, and measurements were made on
replicated and unreplicated regions. Statistics from each
time point were then compiled into four histograms (24
histograms for the 6 time points): ρ(f, t), ρh(ℓ, t), ρi(ℓ, t),
and ρi2i(ℓ, t), where ρ is the distribution of replicated
fractions f at time t, ρh is the hole-length ℓ distribu-
tions at time t, etc. For reasons of space, only the ρ(f, t)
distributions are shown (Fig. 2).

below). Shaded area runs from 10% to 90% replicated (10.5

alescence is approximately 25 min. (B) Initiation rate I(τ ).
The large statistical scatter arises because the data points

points in A. (C) Integrated origin separation, Itot(τ ), which
gives the average distance between all origins activated up to
time τ . In A-C, the green curves are from ﬁts that assume
that I(τ ) has two linear regimes of diﬀerent slopes. The form
we chose for I(τ ) was the simplest analytic form consistent
with the data in B. The parameters for the least-squares ﬁts
(slopes I1 and I2, break point τ1) are obtained from a global
ﬁt to the three data sets in Fig. 3A-C, i.e., ℓh(f ), ℓi(f ), and
ℓi2i(f ).

One can immediately see from the distribution of repli-
cated fractions ρ(f, t) the need to account for the spread
in starting times. If all the segments of DNA that were
analyzed had started replicating at the same time, then
the distributions would have been concentrated over a
very small range of f . But, as one can see in Fig. 2C,

5

some segments of DNA (within the same time point) have
already ﬁnished replicating (f = 1) before others have
even started (f = 0). This spread is far larger than
would be expected on account of the ﬁnite length of the
segments analyzed.

Because of the need to account for the spread in start-
ing times, it is simpler to begin by sorting data by the
replicated fraction f of the measured segment. We thus
assume that all segments with a similar fraction f are at
roughly the same point in S-phase, an assumption that
we can check by partitioning the data into subsets and
redoing our measurements on the subsets. In Fig. 3A-C,
we plot the mean values ℓh, ℓi, and ℓi2i against f . We
then ﬁnd f (τ ), I(τ ), and the cumulative distribution of
lengths between activated origins of replication, Itot(τ ).
(See Fig. 4.)

The direct inversion for I(τ ) (Fig.

4b) shows sev-
eral surprising features: First, origin activation takes
place throughout S-phase and with increasing proba-
bility (measured relative to the amount of unreplicated
DNA), as recently inferred by a cruder analysis of data
from the same system using plasmid DNA (Lucas et al.,
2000). Second, about halfway through S-phase, there is
a marked increase in initiation rate, an observation that,
if conﬁrmed, would have biological signiﬁcance. It is not
known what might cause a sudden increase (break point)
in initiation frequency halfway through S-phase. The in-
crease could reﬂect a change in chromatin structure that
may occur after a given fraction of the genome has under-
gone replication. This in turn may increase the number
of potential origins as DNA synthesis advances (Pasero
and Schwob, 2000).

The smooth curves in Fig 3A-C are ﬁts based on the
model, using an I(τ ) that has two linearly increasing re-
gions, with arbitrary slopes and “break point” (three free
parameters). The ﬁts are quite good, except where the ﬁ-
nite size of the combed DNA fragments becomes relevant.
For example, when mean hole, eye, and eye-to-eye lengths
exceed about 10% of the mean fragment size, larger seg-
ments in the distribution for ℓh(f ), etc., are excluded and
the averages are biased down. We conﬁrmed this with the
Monte-Carlo simulations, the results of which are over-
laid on the experimental data. The ﬁnite fragment size in
the simulation matches that of the experiment, leading
to the same downward bias. In Fig. 4, we overlay the ﬁts
on the experimental data. We emphasize that we obtain
I(τ ) directly from the data, with no ﬁt parameters. The
analytical form is just a model that summarizes the main
features of the origin-initiation rate we determine via our
model, from the experimental data. The important result
is I(τ ).

From the maximum of Itot(τ ), we ﬁnd a mean spac-
0.5 kb, which is
ing between activated origins of 4.8
much smaller than the minimum mean eye-to-eye sepa-
ration 14
1 kb. Interestingly, the former value agrees
well with the calculated distribution of chromatin-bound

±

±

ORC molecules (Walter and Newport, 1997), while the
mean eye-to-eye size coincides with the average chro-
matin loop size (Buongiorno et al., 1982, Blow and
Chong, 1996). In our model, the two quantities diﬀer if
initiation takes place throughout S-phase, as coalescence
of replicated regions leads to fewer domains (and hence
fewer inferred origins). The mean eye-to-eye separation
is of particular interest because its inverse is just the
domain density (number of active domains per length),
which can be used to estimate the number of active repli-
cation forks at each moment during S-phase. For ex-
ample, the saturation value of Itot corresponds to the
maximum number (about 600,000/genome) of active ori-
gins of replication. Since there are about 400 replication
foci/cell nucleus, this would indicate a partitioning of
approximately 1,500 origins (or, equivalently, about 7.5
Mb) per replication focus (Blow and Laskey, 1986; Mills
et al., 1989).

Because the distribution of f values in the ρ(f, t)
plots depends on the unknown starting-time distribution
(φ(t′)), we used the parameters for I(τ ) in order to de-
rive the fork velocity v and the mean and width of the
Gaussian form assumed for φ(t′). As with the f data, we
did a global ﬁt to data from all six time points. We ﬁnd
v = 640
40 bases/min., in excellent agreement with
previous estimates (Mahbubani et al., 1992; Lu et al.,
1998).

±

One can test whether adding higher moments to the
assumed Gaussian form signiﬁcantly improves the ﬁts,
and, in our case, they do not.
(Speciﬁcally, we added
skewness and kurtosis, i.e., third and fourth moments.)
This implies that the actual shape of the starting-time
distribution does not diﬀer greatly from a Gaussian form.
In a future experiment, it would be very desirable to
obtain independent information about the form of φ(t).
One could then constrain other parameters more tightly.
For example, there is a high correlation between the mean
starting time of molecules (here, 20.4 min.) and the ve-
locity. (The width of the distribution, 2.6 min., is much
less coupled in the ﬁts.) An eﬀect that might then be
included in the model is a variable fork velocity. For ex-
ample, v might be decrease as forks coalesce or as replica-
tion factor becomes limiting toward the end of S phase
(Blow and Laskey, 1986; Blow and Watson, 1987; Wu
et al., 1997; Pierron and Benard, 1996). Such eﬀects, if
present, are small enough that they are diﬃcult to see in
the present case.

Another important question is to separate the eﬀects of
any intrinsic distribution due to early and late-replicating
regions of the genome of a single cell from the extrinsic
distribution caused by having many cells in the experi-
ment. One approach would be to isolate and comb the
DNA from a single cell. Although diﬃcult, such an exper-
iment is technically feasible. The latter problem could be
resolved by in situ ﬂuorescence observations of the chosen
cell.

CONCLUSION

In this article, we have introduced a class of theoret-
ical models for describing replication kinetics that is in-
spired by well-known models of crystal-growth kinetics.
The model allows us to extract the rate of initiation of
new origins, a quantity whose time dependence is has
not previously been measured. With remarkably few pa-
rameters, the model ﬁts quantitatively the most detailed
existing experiment on replication in Xenopus. It repro-
duces known results (for example, the fork velocity) and
provides the ﬁrst reliable description of the temporal or-
ganization of replication initiation in a higher eukaryote.
Perhaps most important, the model can be generalized in
a straightforward way to describe replication and extract
relevant parameters in essentially any organism.

Finally, an implicit assumption of our analysis has been
that there is no spatial organization in the nucleation
origins—i.e., that I(τ ) does not depend on the position
x. Directly testing the mean-ﬁeld hypothesis by the data
collapse shown in Fig. 3D justiﬁes this assumption on
length scales up to 200 kb.

DISCUSSION

The view that we are led to here, of random initi-
ation events occurring continuously during the replica-
tion of Xenopus sperm chromatin in egg extracts, is in
striking contrast to what has until recently been the ac-
cepted view of a regular periodic organization of replica-
tion origins throughout the genome (Buongiorno et al.,
1982; Laskey, 1985; Coverly and Laskey, 1994; Blow and
Chong, 1996). For a discussion of experiments that raise
doubts on such a view, see (Berezney, 2000). The applica-
tion of our model to the results of Herrick et al. indicate
that the kinetics of DNA replication in the X. laevis in
vitro system closely resembles that of genome duplication
in early embryos. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the time re-
quired to duplicate the genome in vitro agrees well with
what is observed in vivo. In addition, the model yields
accurate values for replicon sizes and replication fork ve-
locities that conﬁrm previous observations (Mahbubani
et al., 1992; Hyrien and Mechali, 1993). Though replica-
tion in vitro may diﬀer biologically from what occurs in
vivo, the results nevertheless demonstrate that the kinet-
ics remains essentially the same. Of course, the speciﬁc
ﬁnding of an increasing rate of initiation invites a bio-
logical interpretation involving a kind of autocatalysis,
whereby the replication process itself leads to the release
of a factor whose concentration determines the rate of
initiation. This will be explored in future work.

One can entertain many further applications of the ba-
sic model discussed above, which can be generalized, if
need be. For example, Blumenthal et al.
interpreted
their results on replication in Drosophila melanogaster
for ρi2i(ℓ, f ) to imply periodically spaced origins in the
genome (Blumenthal et al., 1974). (See their Fig. 7.) It
is diﬃcult to judge whether their peaks are real or statis-
tical happenstance, but one could check the mean-ﬁeld
hypothesis independently for that data. If the conclusion
is indeed that the origins in that system are arranged pe-
riodically, the kinetics model could be generalized in a
straightforward way (introducing an I(x, τ ) that was pe-
riodic in x). Similar generalizations can be easily incor-
porated into the model to account for DNA replication
in other organisms, including yeast and Physarum.

We study the steady state properties of an insect (spruce budworm)

outbreak model in the presence of Gaussian white noise. Based on the cor-

responding Fokker-Planck equation the steady state solution of the proba-

bility distribution function and its extrema have been investigated. It was

found that ﬂuctuations of the insect birth rate reduces the population of

the insects while ﬂuctuations of predation rate and the noise correlation can

prevent the population of the insects from going into extinction. Noise in

the model can induce a phase transition.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, Nonlinear dynamical systems with random noise have been paid much atten-

tion both theoretically and experimentally. Phenomena such as noise-induced transitions,

stochastic resonance, resonant activation, noise-induced spatial patterns are a few ex-

amples of extensive investigations [1] [2] [3].

In most of these areas the noise aﬀects

the dynamics through system variables, i.e., the noise is multiplicative in nature [4,5].

The focal theme of these types investigation is the steady state properties of systems

in which the ﬂuctuations, generally applied from outside, are considered, independent of

the system’s characteristic dissipation. On the level of a Langevin-type description of

a dynamical system, the presence of noise can change the dynamics of the system [6,7].

Noise processes have found applications in a broad range of studies, such as the steady

state properties of a single mode laser [8], bistable kinetics [9], directed motion in spa-

tially symmetric periodic potentials [10], stochastic resonance in linear systems [11], and

steady state entropy production [12]. In this paper we study an insect outbreak model

in the presence of the correlated noise, and show how noise can dynamically aﬀect the

ecosystem.

II. AN INSECT OUTBREAK MODEL: SPRUCE BUDWORM

A practical model which exhibits two positive linearly steady state populations is that

for the spruce budworm, which can, with ferocous eﬃciency, defoliate the balsam ﬁr.

They are major problem in Canada [13], Ludwing [14] (1978) considered the budworm

population dynamics to be governed by the equation

dN
dt

= rBN(1

N
kB

)

−

−

P (N).

Here rB is the linear birth rate of the budworm and KB is carrying capacity which is
related to the density of the foliage available on trees. The P (N) term represents pre-

dation, generated by birds. We take the form for P (N) suggested by Ludwing (1978),
namely BN 2/(A2 + N 2), where A is a positive constant and B represents the predation
rate of the birds. The dynamics of N(t) is then governed by

dN

= rBN(1

A2 + N 2 .

Before analysing the model we will express it in nondimensional terms. Here we in-

troduce nondimensional quantities by

Now, if some environmental external disturbances make both the birth rate and the

predation rate ﬂuctuate, it is likely to aﬀect r and β in the form of multiplicative noises

that are connected through a correlation parameter λ. As a result we have

FIG. 1. Plot of the extrema of SPDF as a function of x for diﬀerent noise strength values:

D = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7,using β = 2.0, and q = 10.0.

In Fig.1, for zero noise strength, the curve at r = 1.0 gives only one x value, but as

the value of D increases, the curve changes. The curve shows three x values at r = 1.0.

From the ﬁgure we can see that the noise strength can change the state of the system.

In Fig.2 we show the eﬀect of the noise strength D on the SPDF. For a small value

of D, the SPDF shows a single peak region, which changes for larger values of D (see

Fig.2). As the value of D increases, the peak for the larger values of x decreases. At

the same time, for small values of x, a new peak appears. It can be said that the noise

causes the system become from two states to one state, namely noise can induce a phase

transition. On the other hand, since x, D give the relative budworm population and the

ﬂuctuation of the budworm’s birth rate, respectively, we can see from the ﬁgure the eﬀect

4

the ﬂuctuation of the birth rate makes on the growth of budworms, they can even make

the budworms go into extinction.

IV. THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE PREDATION RATE IN THE MODEL

On the other hand, if only the ﬂuctuation of predation rate is investigated, namely

D = 0 and λ = 0 we can get the stationary probability distribution function similar to

Eq.(14)

In order to discuss the eﬀect of the ﬂuctuation of the predation rate on the system we

adopt r = 1.0, q = 10.0, β = 2.26, the results are shown in Fig.3.

Fig. 3 shows the eﬀect of the noise strength σ on the SPDF. For a small value of σ,

the SPDF shows the typical bistable region (see Fig.3) which vanishes for large values of

5

(20)

(21)

(22)

σ. As the value of σ increases the peak at the small x value decreases drastically, while

for a large σ value the curve has a single peak at the large x value . Since x denotes the

budworm relative population, it is clear from Fig.3 that, with an increase in the ﬂuctua-

tions of the predation rate, the budworm recover from going into extinction.

V. EFFECT OF NOISE CORRELATION IN THE SYSTEM

Since the two type of ﬂuctuations have the common origin, (environmental external

disturbance), we will consider the eﬀect of the correlation between the birth rate ﬂuc-

tuation and the predation rate ﬂuctuation. Based on Eq. (10)-Eq. (13) the stationary

probabilities distribution function is represented by Fig. 4 with r = 1.0, β = 2.0, D = 0.3,

σ = 0.3.

Fig. 4 gives the eﬀect of noise correlation parameter λ on SPDF. For a small λ value

the SPDF shows a typical bistable region which will vanish for the large value of λ. As

the correlation parameter increases the height of the peak on the small x value decreases,

while the height of the peak on the large x value increases, namely probabilities ﬂow from

the small x value to the large x value. Since x denotes the budworm relative population,

it is clear from Fig. 4 that the correlation of the noises is a advantageous factor for the

growth of the budworm.

VI. SUMMARY

In this paper, we studied the steady state properties of an insect outbreak model in

the presence of the correlated noise. Birth rate ﬂuctuation, predation rate ﬂuctuation

and the correlation of the noises are investigated. Birth rate ﬂuctuation work against the

growth of the budworm population, while both ﬂuctuation of the predation rate and the

correlation of the noises can prevent the budworm population from going into extinction.

On the other hand, noise can dynamically aﬀect the ecosystem. The noise from the birth

rate ﬂuctuation can make the system change from a single steady state to a bistable state,

while noise from the predation rate ﬂuctuation induces the system change from a bistable

state to a single steady state. Thus in the insect outbreak model, noise from the ﬂuctua-

tion of the parameters can induce a phase transition. This viewpoint is completely novel

in the traditional viewpoint it is the stochastic force that disturbs the phase transition.

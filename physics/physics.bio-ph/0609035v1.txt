Abstract

The time spent by an interacting Brownian molecule inside a bounded
microdomain has many applications in cellular biology, because the
number of bounds is a quantitative signal, which can initiate a cas-
cade of chemical reactions and thus has physiological consequences. In
the present article, we propose to estimate the mean time spent by a
Brownian molecule inside a microdomain Ω which contains small holes
on the boundary and agonist molecules located inside. We found that
the mean time depends on several parameters such as the backward
binding rate (with the agonist molecules), the mean escape time from
the microdomain and the mean time a molecule reaches the binding
sites (forward binding rate). In addition, we estimate the mean and the
variance of the number of bounds made by a molecule before it exits Ω.
These estimates rely on a boundary layer analysis of a conditional mean
ﬁrst passage time, solution of a singular partial diﬀerential equation. In
particular, we apply the present results to obtain an estimate of the
mean time spent (Dwell time) by a Brownian receptor inside a synaptic
domain, when it moves freely by lateral diﬀusion on the surface of a
neuron and interacts locally with scaﬀolding molecules.

Biochemical reactions in cellular microdomains involve, in general, a small
number of molecules that can bind to agonist molecules, conﬁned in some

subregions. A microdomain Ω is deﬁned as a bounded domain where a large
fraction of the boundary ∂Ωr is reﬂective and a small part ∂Ωa of it is absorp-
tive, which allows molecules to enter or/and exit. Under normal physiological
conditions, a molecule can be trapped inside a microdomain for a period long
enough, compared to other time scales such as free diﬀusion or binding time.
Because a molecule can be trapped for a long time, many chemical bounds
can be made, before it exits. From a physiological stand point, an interesting
property of such microdomain is that depending on the number of chemical
bounds made by a molecule, a cascade of chemical reactions can be initiated,
which ultimately aﬀects some physiological properties. Our interest here is
to estimate the number of chemical bounds made by a Brownian interacting
molecule inside Ω. This number depends on the geometry of the microdomain
and the distribution of agonist molecules. We also provide an estimation of the
mean time spent (Dwell time) by a molecule inside the microdomain, denoted
by E(τD). For that purpose, we derive an asymptotic formula for the Dwell
time, the mean and the variance of the number of bounds made before the
molecule exits, as the ratio |
tends to zero. Finally, we derive a formula for
|
the Dwell time of a molecule inside Ω, when a steady state ﬂux of molecules
is maintained ﬁxed at the absorbing boundary. The role of the ﬂux is to ﬁx
the number of free binding sites. Using the present method, we also obtain
an estimate of the forward binding rate constant. Historically, the theory of
chemical reactions at a molecular level limited by diﬀusion has been developed
by many authors, to quote but a few [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: using the classical theory of
diﬀusion and interactions with binding sites, various rate constants were com-
puted. Recently, using averaged equations, chemical reactions in microdomains
have been described in [6, 7]. Chemical reactions in closed microdomains were
studied in [8], where we obtain, in particular, some estimates on the mean of
the variance of the number of bound molecules in a steady state regime. In
[9], an asymptotic estimate of the mean time it takes for a Brownian molecule
to escape an empty domain through small openings located on the boundary,
was obtained using a new type of singular perturbation problem. More specif-

In the ﬁrst approximation, the mean time τ (x) does not depend on the initial
position x and will be denoted by τ .
In this article, we obtain an explicit
asymptotic estimation of the Dwell time E(τD) as a function of the character-
istic sizes of the domain Ω, the size of the small openings ∂Ωa, the number of
the binding molecules. More speciﬁcally, E(τD) is given by expression (2.12),

It is well known from the theory of chemical reactions that the backward

molecules. If ∆E denotes the activation barrier, kTe is the energy due to the

where C is a constant that depends on the temperature Te, the electrostatic

ﬁcient [10]. In the ﬁrst part of the paper, we derive equation (1.2) by count-
ing the number of bounds between the Brownian molecule and the agonist
molecules, before the Brownian molecule exits the domain.
In the second
and mδ
part, we derive some asymptotic estimates of the quantities
as a function of the geometry, when the radius δ of the binding site tends to
zero. Although the present computations are carried out in two dimensions,
they can be extended to dimension 3 by using the techniques developed in [11].
Finally in the last part, we apply the present computations to study chemical
reactions occurring in synaptic microdomains: the chemical reactions are the
binding of receptors with the scaﬀolding molecules. It is indeed of great interest
to analyze the mechanism that regulates the number and the type of receptors
at a synapse, because receptors control the synaptic weight. Any ﬂuctuations
of the number results in a variation of the synaptic weight and aﬀects the
reliability of the synaptic transmission. Moreover, certain experimental proto-
cols have lead to a Long Term Potentiation of a synapse, a mechanism which
is associated with a change of the number and the type of certain receptors
[12, 13]. The regulation of synaptic plasticity is a fundamental process under-
lying learning and memory [12, 13] and recently, single molecule tracking has
revealed that the number of postsynaptic receptors, which participate to the
synaptic transmission, is not ﬁxed but it changes due to constant traﬃck of
receptors on the surface of neurons. Receptors move in and out from synaptic
regions [14] [15] and following these observations, many questions have been
raised:
in particular, what determines the time spent by a receptor inside a
synapse? How receptors can be stabilized inside a synapse? How long they
stay inside synaptic microdomains? Such questions are partially answered in
the present paper. In particular, our computation of the Dwell time of a re-
ceptor inside a speciﬁc microdomain, called the Postsynaptic density (PSD)
takes into account the interaction with the scaﬀolding molecules, which was
ignored in [9].

1.1 Molecular dynamics in a microdomain

The dynamics of a molecule or a protein moving on the surface of a cell is
usually described in the Smoluchowsky limit (large friction) of the Langevin
equation [10]: for a molecule of mass m, described by its position X at time
t, with a friction coeﬃcient γ, moving inside a potential well V , the Smolu-
chowsky limit of the Langevin equation is

where εe = kTe
m and w is a Gaussian random variable with variance 1 and mean
0. In a microdomain Ω, where a large fraction of the boundary is reﬂective ∂Ωr
and a small part of it is absorptive ∂Ωa, the probability density function (pdf)
p to ﬁnd X at time t in the surface element x + dx satisﬁes the Fokker-Planck

where δ is the Delta-Dirac function. In equation (1.5), V represents the po-

fact, the sum of the local potential wells, supported inside a ball of ﬁnite radius

generated by the binding molecules. Usually the binding molecules are scat-
tered inside the domain Ω, but in the present model we replace the scattered
distribution of binding molecules by a simpliﬁed distribution, where we imag-
ine that all the binding molecules are located inside a compartment D(δ) in Ω.
In the present description, the potential V becomes an eﬀective potential de-
ﬁned in D(δ), whose characteristics should be such that the classical chemical
reaction theory is recovered. More speciﬁcally, we can deﬁne the microdomain
Ω containing the binding domain D(δ), which replaces the domain with many
scattered binding sites: this simpliﬁed domain made of two compartments is
called the homogenized microdomain and is described as (see ﬁgure 1)

1. An internal compartment, which is described as a disk D(δ) of radius δ.
This disk represents the region where the binding sites are located. In-
stead of using the dynamics associated with equation (1.4), we describe
the entrance and the exit of a molecule inside D(δ) using a Poissonnian
description, where the mean can be related to the properties of the po-
tential well. For that purpose, we recall that a chemical reaction with
a binding molecule is described as the arrival of a Brownian molecule
inside the disk D(δ). The release process is modeled as the escape of
the molecule from the potential well V and is described by the chemical
reaction

2. An external compartment separated from the rest of the biological envi-
ronment by the boundary ∂Ωr, containing small openings ∂Ωa. Molecules
can enter or exit through the openings and thus can be exchanged with
the rest of the cellular medium (see ﬁgure 1). The dynamics of a molecule
in that compartment is described as pure Brownian until it escapes.

1.2 Time spent by a molecule inside a disk containing

a small opening

We estimate asymptotically the Dwell time E(τD) of a molecule inside a domain
Ω, when the domain Ω is a disk D(R) of radius R. The case of a general domain
is left open. By deﬁnition, E(τD) is the mean time to exit, averaged over an
initial uniform distribution. We make the following assumptions: the ratio ε of

−
motion inside Aδ until it hits D(δ) or the absorbing boundary ∂Ωa. When the
Brownian molecule enters into D(δ), which represents the domain of chemical
reactions, while it reacts with an eﬀective binding molecule during a mean time

the absorbing to the reﬂective boundary of D(R) is small << 1. The absorbing
(resp. reﬂecting) part is denoted ∂Ωa (resp. ∂Ωr). The computation of the
Dwell time will be made using the homogenization version of the domain,
described in the previous paragraph: the binding molecules are located in the
small concentric disk D(δ), where δ << R. Each time a molecule enters into
D(δ), it can be bound with a binding molecule and will be released in the
D(δ). Since R is a ﬁxed parameter, we will denote
annulus Aδ(R) = D(R)
the annulus by Aδ. We assume that the boundary ∂D(δ) is always absorbing.

2 The Dwell Time E(τD)

The goal of this section is to derive a general expression of the Dwell time
E(τD). The movement of a molecule is described here as Brownian (see [17, 14]
for the case of a synapse) with a diﬀusion constant D and Xx(t) is the position
of a molecule at time t starting at position x. E(τD) is the mean time a
molecule remains inside the domain Ω before it exits, averaged over a uniform
initial distribution inside the annulus Aδ = D(R)
D(δ). Inside Aδ, a molecule
diﬀuses freely until it hits ∂D(δ). Inside D(δ), a bound molecule is kept ﬁxed
1
k−1 , before being released inside Aδ at a random position,
for a mean time
distributed uniformly. To estimate the Dwell time E(τD), we ﬁrst consider the

−

Dwell time E(τ x), conditioned on the initial position located inside Aδ. We
do not consider here the entrance of the Brownian receptor inside the domain,
which would require to use a Langevin formulation of the dynamics [10]. We
derive a formula for E(τ x) by counting the number of times a molecule enters
into D(δ) before it exits: either a molecule exits with no bindings or many
bindings occur, before the receptor leaves D(R). Let T Ax denote the ﬁrst
passage time the trajectory Xx(t) hits the absorbing boundary ∂Ωa. Similarly
we deﬁne by T Sx the ﬁrst passage time of the trajectory Xx(t) to the boundary
of D(δ). We deﬁne now the probability pδ(x) that a trajectory Xx(t) leaves
the domain Aδ before any bounds occur, explicitly

pδ(x) = Pr

To estimate E(τD), we consider the diﬀerent random events related to the
number of times the Brownian molecule enters into the region Aδ, before it
exits. F x
is the event that a receptor exits the microdomain Aδ when no
bindings occur, starting at position x. F x
is the event that a receptor starting
at x, enters the domain D(δ) only once and then exits without entering again
in D(δ). Similarly, we deﬁne the event F x
n that a receptor starting at position
x exits after exactly n bounds. The probability that the molecule has left the
domain before time t is P r

Remark.
It seems artiﬁcial to free a bounded molecule not immediately
at the boundary of the domain Dδ. But in fact, the release process can be
modeled by re-initiating the molecule at the boundary of Dδ, otherwise it would
immediately return to a bounded state. To avoid this unrealistic behavior, we
have used the distribution function ρ(y) to model the releasing process. A
more accurate scenario would require to use a Langevin description, which
accounts for the acceleration of the molecule: when a molecule is released with
a random Gaussian initial velocity, it can travel up to a certain distance, before
its velocity reaches the value of mean thermal velocity of free molecules.

2.2 The mean number of bounds before exit

To estimate the mean number of bounds made by a molecule before it exits,
we use the analysis of the previous paragraph. The probability that a molecule
starting at x does not bind before exit is exactly Pr(F x
0 ), while the probability
that exactly k bounds are made is Pr(F x
k ). We deﬁne the average probability
by

ﬁrst time a molecule starting from x hits the absorbing boundary. We assume
that when a molecule exits the domain Ω, it does not come back. T S

4.1 Asymptotic expansion of the mean ﬁrst passage time

When the radius δ of the inner circle is small, we obtain an explicit asymptotic
expansion of the mean conditional time tA, solution of equation (4.2). We ﬁrst
derive an asymptotic solution by gluing two solutions: 1) when the initial point
x is far from the inner-circle, the solution looks like the mean exit time when
the drift term is set to zero. This solution is called the outer-solution and has
been estimated in [24] with similar boundary conditions. 2) When the initial
point x is chosen near the inner-circle, the solution can be approximated by
a radial function. The approximation is valid in a boundary layer and has to
match the radial part of the outer-solution at least C 1 .

4.2 Outer-solution

We now provide a construction of the outer-solution to equation (4.2). We
start with the expansion of p, which depends on the parameter δ.

u = 0 on ∂Ωa.

(4.7)

We can now use the result of [9, 24] to compute the leading order term of u.
For x that does not belong to a boundary layer near the absorbing boundary
∂Ωa, the asymptotic expansion of u is given by

u(x) =

ln(

of ∂Ωa, the derivatives ∂u
r∂θ are small at the ﬁrst order in δ and ǫ. We
now consider the ﬁrst order term in α in equation (4.5), which satisﬁes the
equation

ary layer is given by formula (6.19) in the appendix. To estimate tA, we use
the expression of the conditional probability pδ. As described in the appendix
(6.2.2), it can be approximated by a radial function, so that equation (4.2)
becomes

5 Discussion and conclusion

In this article, we have computed the mean time spent by a molecule inside
a microdomain Ω, when it can interact with some binding sites, represented
as a connected sub-domain D(δ)
Ω. This simpliﬁed assumption ignores the
scattered distribution of the binding sites but leaves one free parameter δ. A
rational way to choose the radius δ is to equal the length 2πδ with the sum of
the potential well boundary length of each binding site.

⊂

20

More generally, the problem of estimating the Dwell time of a molecule in
Ω when there are already many other independent molecules, is much more
involved. The reason is that even if these molecules are not interacting, they
are coupled through the competition for the binding sites. However, if the
mean number of bound receptors is ﬁxed and the variance is small enough, the
Dwell time formula (4.36) can be applied, by choosing for δ, a value that is
related to the amount of free binding sites available (see below). In general,
when the number of bounded molecules is ﬂuctuating, a diﬀerent model is
needed to account for the ﬂuctuations. In that case, a diﬀerent derivation of
the Dwell time is needed.

5.1 Receptor traﬃcking at synapses

The explicit expression of the Dwell time can be used to describe receptor
dynamics at synapses. A synapse is a micro-contact between two neurons,
involved in signal transmission. In the past decades experimental observations
have revealed that the molecular composition of the postsynaptic part of a
synapse depends on the history of the neuronal activity [13, 12, 25, 14, 17, 15,
26]. Although it is a diﬃcult problem to predict the chemical organization of
a synapse, it has been found experimentally that the type and the number of
receptors do not appear randomly, but are well regulated during speciﬁc synap-
tic plasticity protocols, such as Long Term Potentiation (LTP). During LTP
[13], the number and the type of receptors can change, whereas extra-synaptic
receptors diﬀuse inside a speciﬁc microdomain called the postsynaptic density
(PSD). Recently, the concept has emerged that receptors are constantly mov-
ing on the neuronal surface, in and out of the synaptic domain [15]. Moreover,
receptors are also cycling between the cell surface and intracellular pools. Ac-
cording to some recent experimental results [14], the movement of the receptors
at synapses can be approximated by a random walk in the heterogeneous PSD.
Moreover, it has been observed that receptors can become conﬁned for random
times [14] and can also be bound to scaﬀolding molecules. The PSD delimits
a bounded domain Ω containing small openings at the boundary, where recep-
tors can be exchanged with the rest of the dendrite. The PSD contains many
fundamental molecules, scaﬀolding proteins, receptors, kinases, and many oth-
ers required for the normal synaptic activity. The PSD is thus a place where
the synaptic molecular machinery is concentrated. Scaﬀolding molecules may
be used to anchor receptors and/or to change the biophysical properties of
receptors. Because scaﬀolding molecules are scattered inside the domain Ω, in
the present model we have replaced the complex organization of the PSD by a
homogenized domain (Figure 1). We can apply the result of the ﬁrst part of the
present paper to obtain some estimates of the mean time spent by a receptor
inside the PSD, when it can bind with scaﬀolding molecules. Estimate (4.36)

21

of the Dwell time E(τD) depends on the size δ of the scaﬀolding domain and is
a good approximation when the amount of free scaﬀolding molecules is small
δ << 1 and when the corral barrier, measured by ε, made by the impenetrable
molecules around the PSD, is also small.

5.2 Dwell time of a single receptor in a synapse con-

taining many other receptors

To estimate the mean time a receptor stays inside the PSD, we consider the
case where the inﬂux J of receptors entering the PSD is ﬁxed. The Dwell time
can be computed from formula (4.36) once the value of the radius δ is known.
δ is indeed the radius of the disk containing the free scaﬀolding molecules. To
obtain an estimate of δ, we consider the dynamics where each injected receptor
can escape with a rate τ , approximated by formula (1.1). When the number
of injected receptors is balanced by the exiting one from the PSD, the total
number of free receptors inside the PSD is given by

(for a detailed analysis see [27]). Under the steady state assumption, the
number of free scaﬀolding molecules can be estimated by using the law of
chemical reaction (1.10) which says that

−

S] is the number of bounds.

where [R
[S]) the number of free
receptors (resp. scaﬀolding molecules) K is the equilibrium reaction constant
per unit area. If [S0] denotes the initial number of scaﬀolding molecules, the
conservation of matter (the total number of scaﬀolding molecules is conserved)
and equation 5.2 implies that

[R] (resp.

[S0] = [S] + [R

S] = [S] + K[R][S]

= (1 + KJτ )[S]

−

Thus, if [S] (resp. [S0]) occupies a surface πδ2, (resp. πδ2

0), then

δ0 can be related to the concentration c0 of scaﬀolding molecules by c0 = [S0]
.

To obtain the mean time estimate, expression (5.5) of δ should be used in the
Dwell time formula.

Expression (5.5) depends on the equilibrium constant K, which in fact

that the forward binding rate k1 represents the rate of arrival of a free receptor
to a free binding site and can be approximated by

In practice, the value of δ obtained by solving equation (5.9) can now be used

times.

Finally, when the total number of receptors inside Ω is small, the radius
δ cannot be approximated by a constant, rather it is ﬂuctuating and in that
case, the present approach needs to be adapted. A variant model of the PSD
has been proposed in [27], based on a Markovian approach, which uses an in-
and out-ﬂux of receptors. At steady state, under some approximations, some
estimates of the mean and the ﬂuctuation of the total number of bound recep-
tors are obtained, however the computations depend on an a priori expression
of the forward binding rate.

vanishes. We expect to see a boundary layer near the circle r = δ, as δ goes to
zero. pδ is a regular function and a Taylor expansion in the r-variable inside

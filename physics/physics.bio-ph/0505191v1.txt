Abstract

Theory and experiment have established that F-actin ﬁlaments are strongly attached to the in-

tracellular parasites (such as Listeria) they propel with “comet tails”. We consider the implications

of these observations for propulsion. By calculating the motion produced in various models of at-

tachment and comparing to experiment we demonstrate that the attachment must be sliding rather

than hinged. By modeling experiments on ActA-coated spheres we draw conclusions regarding the

interaction between F-actin and their surfaces that may also be applicable to living systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A number of intracellular parasites, some of medical as well as scientiﬁc interest, propel

themselves through host cells by suborning the host’s actin polymerization machinery, in-

ducing it to provide propulsive force for the parasite [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. These

parasites include Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella ﬂexneri, Rickettsiae and Vaccinia virus.

Catalytic proteins on the surface of the parasite initiate the growth of new polymeric (F-)

actin ﬁlaments on the surface.

F-actin appears to be tightly bound to the surface it pushes. Evidence for binding [12, 13,

14, 15, 16, 17, 18] includes measurement of discrete displacement steps nearly equal to the

diameter (5.4 nm) of G-actin, direct observation and the theoretical argument that in the

absence of binding Brownian diﬀusion would readily sever the contact between the parasite

and its propelling bundle of F-actin ﬁlaments (called a comet-tail, from its micrographic

appearance). Angular diﬀusion is also rapid in the absence of binding; for a sphere of radius
r = 1 µm, Dθ = kT /8πηr3 = 0.16 radian2/sec, taking the viscosity η of pure water; the

eﬀective viscosity of cytoplasm is greater, scale dependent and poorly understood [19, 20, 21].

Even if the eﬀective viscosity were 100 times greater, unattached bacteria would tumble

rapidly, in contradiction to observation.

Maintaining contact over a time t requires an attractive potential V ≤ −kT ln (νt), where

ν is a relaxation rate (an eﬀective attempt frequency). A number of processes contribute

to ν: viscous drag on the sphere, the (damped) elastic modes of the actin ﬁlaments, and

elastic/plastic ﬂow of the actin gel embedded in the surrounding aqueous medium. Of these,

only the ﬁrst is known quantitatively: The viscous damping of a µm-sized object of density
ρ and radius r gives ν = 9η/(2ρr2) ∼ 107 sec−1 (in water). Taking t ≥ 103 sec as an
empirical lower bound on the attachment time we ﬁnd V ≤ −1.0 × 10−19 J [15]. Because the

dependence of V on ν is logarithmic, this result is only weakly dependent on uncertainties

(such as the applicable viscosity) in ν.

The interaction between a ﬁlament of F-actin and the protein-covered surface to which it

is bound is complex, and not calculable from ab initio interatomic potentials. The purpose

of this work is to constrain that interaction by calculating the consequences for propulsion

of simple models of the interaction, and then comparing the results to experiment.

Intercalation is driven by the free energy [22] ∆G ≈ 6 × 10−20 J released when a molecule

2

of G-actin is added to a ﬁlament of F-actin. During intercalation a single ﬁlament exerts a

force F ∼ ∆G/a ≈ 20 pN on the G-actin, drawing it into the gap between the F-actin and

the surface proteins to which it is bound. This force is suﬃcient to drive µm-sized objects at

speeds ∼ 0.1 cm/sec against viscous drag (taking the viscosity to be that of water), so the

intercalation is complete and ∆G dissipated in a few µsec. The product of the duration of
a single intercalation tI = 6πηa2r/∆G (the force must move the sphere and the ﬁlament to

make room for the intercalated monomer) and the Brownian relaxation rate ν of a propelled

sphere deﬁnes a new dimensionless number which we call the intercalation smoothness

The intercalating Reynolds number of both the sphere and the G-actin are

When NIS ≫ 1 and Re ≪ 1, as is the case here (NIS ≈ 102 for r = 0.25 µm, taking the vis-

cosity of pure water) the Stokes ﬂow approximation (implicitly averaging over the sphere’s

and ﬁlament’s Brownian motion) may be used during the intercalation, even though the

entire intercalation is eﬀectively instantaneous compared to the intervals between intercala-

tions. NIS is related to the Reynolds number, but not entirely determined by it because of
the additional factor a/r ∼ 10−2. There are parameter regimes (not relevant to the exper-

iments discussed here) for which both Re ≪ 1 and NIS ≪ 1, so that Stokes ﬂow would be

applicable but in which it would not be valid to average over the Brownian motion of the

sphere or ﬁlament.

II. CALCULATIONS

We have performed Monte-Carlo simulations of the eﬀects of G-actin intercalation in a

model in which the F-actin is attached to the surface of a sphere. This model is necessarily

much simpliﬁed compared to a full physical description. For example, we employ crude

approximations to the ﬂow around the sphere with attached F-actin and ignore cross-linking

within the actin tail. Recognizing the crudity of our models, we note that doing better

would require either formidable numerical calculations (for example, of the ﬂow around a

sphere with attached ﬁlaments) and quantitative understanding (of actin cross-linking, and

3

of the precise geometry of the attached ﬁlaments) which does not exist. Despite these rough

approximations, we believe our qualitative conclusions are reliable and useful.

We use three-dimensional physics except for a model of the geometry in which the F-actin

is constrained to lie in a single equatorial disc. We take the ﬂow ﬁelds to be those of Stokesian

ﬂow around a sphere. The surrounding ﬂuid, as is generally the case in low Reynolds number

hydrodynamics [23], is an eﬀectively inﬁnite sink of momentum and angular momentum, just

as it is also a heat bath.

The crucial question is the mechanism by which the symmetry of a particle initially

uniformly covered with intercalation sites is broken, producing directed motion. Symmetry

is much simpler to deﬁne and easier to achieve on the rim of a disc (on which equally

spaced points are equivalent) than on the surface of a sphere (on which it is not, in general,

possible to distribute N equivalent points). Symmetry-breaking results from ampliﬁcation

of statistical ﬂuctuations in the locations of the intercalation sites, which depend on N but

not on dimensionality.

At the beginning of a Monte Carlo run N (N = 50 in the calculations shown here),

intercalation sites are distributed uniformly around the rim of the disc. By eliminating any

statistical deviation from symmetry in the location of sites we focus attention of the mech-

anism by which symmetry is broken. The loci of intercalation events are chosen randomly

from these sites. The time scale is arbitrarily deﬁned by an assumed intercalation rate,

but all other parameters are physically meaningful. Each intercalation introduces a relative

displacement of a = 2.7 nm between the F-actin (initially containing zero monomers) and

its attachment point. This displacement is divided between the ﬁlament and the sphere in

inverse proportion to their viscous drags (using the three dimensional results for an isolated

sphere without attached ﬁlaments and a prolate ellipsoid [23, 24]). Their mutual hydrody-

namic interaction and their interactions with the other ﬁlaments are small and not calculable

analytically, and are ignored. The displacement of the attachment point is resolved into a

radial part, which displaces the disc, and a tangential part, which rotates it.

When the disc is displaced it is surrounded by a Stokes ﬂow ﬁeld (taken to be that of

a sphere). All ﬁlaments are immersed in this ﬂow ﬁeld, aﬀect it, and move with it. A

quantitative calculation of the ﬂow ﬁeld would not be feasible in this complex geometry,

so we approximate it by assuming each ﬁlament, if free to rotate, is rotated about its

attachment point by an angle ∆θ = f a sin φ/(r + ℓ/2), where f is the fraction of the relative

4

displacement accommodated by the disc, ℓ is the length of the ﬁlament, r = 0.25 µm is the

sphere’s radius and φ is the angle between the radius vector to the attachment point and

the sphere’s displacement vector. This approximates moving the midpoint of the (nearly

rigid) ﬁlament along with its local (Stokesian) ﬂow ﬁeld around a sphere. If the attachment

points are permitted to slide along the sphere’s periphery they are displaced by an angle

(measured at the center of the equatorial disc) ∆θ = f a sin φ/(r + ℓ/2); a small minimum

angular separation between ﬁlaments is imposed. We consider only a single particle in an

inﬁnite ﬂuid; this amounts to requiring that any walls or other particles or ﬁlaments are

many times more distant than the diameter of the sphere or the length of the ﬁlament.

Similarly, when the sphere is rotated there is a surrounding Stokesian [23] ﬂow ﬁeld. We

approximate the rotation of each ﬁlament about its attachment point by an angle ∆θ =

(3/4)f a sin θt/(r + ℓ/2), where the numerator is the displacement of the disc circumference

and θt is the initial angle between the ﬁlament and the normal at its attachment point.

We ﬁrst consider a model in which the attachments are ﬁxed hinges. Initially, intercalation

produces only inﬁnitesimal displacement of the sphere because as ℓ → 0, f → 0. As the

ﬁlaments lengthen f → 1 and the sphere’s displacement at each intercalation increases. The

rotation of the ﬁlaments around their hinges, resulting from their viscous drag, now leads

to their being swept back in a direction opposite to the sphere’s motion. Once swept back,

further intercalation tends, on average, to propel the sphere in the direction of its earlier

motion. The symmetry of the initial conditions is broken by the stochastic ﬂuctuations in

the intercalation sites, and the sphere acquires a systematic motion. Increasing orientational

asymmetry of the ﬁlaments leads to preferential motion in the direction opposite to the mean

ﬁlament, and further orientation of the ﬁlaments in that direction as the process runs away.

The Reynolds number remains small, so this is not an inertial eﬀect; the directional memory

resides in the orientation of the ﬁlaments.

In a second model the attachment points are free to slide along the surface of the sphere

as they are swept back by the Stokes ﬂow, but are held perpendicular to the sphere, as

is considered, for example, by [17] (and is achieved in simple mechanical devices). No

torques are exerted on the sphere so it does not systematically rotate. Once statistical

ﬂuctuations break the initial symmetry, intercalation between swept-back ﬁlaments and the

sphere preferentially pushes the sphere in the direction of its earlier motion. This process

then runs away. As before, the Reynolds number remains very small and the directional

5

memory resides in the locations of the ﬁlaments’ attachment points.

III. RESULTS

Results of numerical simulation of the hinged model are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.

Initially random ﬂuctuations ﬁrst give way to directed displacement. Later, rotation runs

away as it sweeps the ﬁlaments back around their hinges, and this orientation contributes to

further rotation like a pinwheel. The mean speed then drops, directed displacement ends,

and no comet-tail forms.

Results for the sliding model are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The random number

generator was initialized with the same seed as in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2; the initial motion is

very similar because little rotation or translation of the ﬁlaments has occurred in either

model. However, between 7500 and 10000 steps (the fourth and ﬁfth “sunbursts” in the

upper right panel of Fig. 3) the attachments have slid signiﬁcantly and directed motion has

begun. Soon thereafter, this process runs away, the ﬁlaments condense to an ordered comet-

tail, and the motion becomes steady and directed. Within the limits of the computational

model (which has no surrounding cytoskeleton or branching or cross-linking of ﬁlaments),

this is a satisfactory representation of the observed comet-tails.

IV. DISCUSSION

These results may help explain the experiments of [25, 26, 27], in which polystyrene

spheres partially but spherically symmetrically (as well as can be achieved experimentally)

coated with the actin polymerization-stimulating protein AcTa and immersed in cytoplasm

(Xenopus egg extract) were observed after a latency time to break their initial symmetry

and develop comet-tails of F-actin and directed motion. This behavior is similar to that

which we ﬁnd with sliding attachments (as pointed out in [16], in this experiment the ActA

may “crawl” on the surface of the beads).

The most remarkable feature of these experiments is the non-monotonic dependence of

bead motility (and comet-tail formation) on the fraction of bead surface covered by ActA,

peaking around 3/8 coverage. This is naturally explained by our calculations, for a bead

sparsely covered with ActA will develop little propulsive force (bead motion is restrained

6

by pre-existing cytoskeleton), while a bead completely covered oﬀers no room for the ActA,

and attached F-actin, to be swept back into a comet-tail. Thus, from these experiments and

our calculations we determine the properties of the F-actin binding to the bead surface and

constrain microscopic mechanical models such as those of [17]. In contrast, experiments [28]

in which ActA is covalently bound to beads do not show comet tails and propulsion, which

is attributable to the inability of covalently bound ActA to slide over the beads’ surfaces.

Latency was also found in experiments [29] on spheres in a synthetic growth medium.

In these experiments beads continuously covered with actin did move, but in a saltatory

manner, apparently as a result of elastic stresses [30] (not considered here) in a fractured

continuous shell of F-actin. When the coverage was only partial, the motion was continuous,

resembling the results of [25] and agreeing with our calculations.

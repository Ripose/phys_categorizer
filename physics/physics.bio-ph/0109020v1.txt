Abstract

We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of a ﬁnite population of sequences adapt-
ing to NK ﬁtness landscapes. We ﬁnd that, unlike in the case of an inﬁnite popu-
lation, the average ﬁtness in a ﬁnite population is maximized at a small but ﬁnite,
rather than vanishing, mutation rate. The highest local maxima in the landscape are
visited for even larger mutation rates, close to a transition point at which the pop-
ulation delocalizes (i.e., leaves the ﬁtness peak at which it was localized) and starts
traversing the sequence space. If the mutation rate is increased even further, the
population undergoes a second transition and loses all sensitivity to ﬁtness peaks.
This second transition corresponds to the standard error threshold transition ﬁrst
described by Eigen. We discuss the implications of our results for biological evolution
and for evolutionary optimization techniques.

1 Introduction

The evolution of a ﬁnite population in a rugged, multi-peaked ﬁtness landscape
is an important area of research in theoretical biology. Although thoroughly
studied over the last 15 years, we are still far from a complete understanding
of the intricate dynamics that unfold. Most analytical results deal with very
simple ﬁtness landscapes, such as the ﬂat landscape [1], the single peak land-
scape [2–4], multiplicative [5,6] or additive [7] landscapes, or other landscapes

that contain a high degree of symmetries, such as the Royal Road landscape [8].
Numerically, one may study more complicated situations, such as RNA fold-
ing landscapes [9,10] or self-replicating computer programs [11]. Here, we are
interested in the family of NK landscapes [12,13]. The NK landscapes are in-
teresting because their ruggedness can be tuned, from a single smooth peak
to a completely random landscape, so that the inﬂuence of ruggedness on the
dynamics of an evolving population can be studied systematically.

Traditionally, NK landscapes have been studied in the context of an adaptive
walker, which is essentially a population of size one. If the product of popu-
lation size M and mutation rate u is small, uM ≪ 1, the adaptive walk is
a reasonable approximation of the full population dynamics. For larger prod-
ucts uM, however, quasispecies eﬀects such as error thresholds [14] or selection
for mutational robustness [15,16] are to be expected. Here, we are mainly in-
terested in the change of the population dynamics as the mutation rate is
increased, so that uM cannot be considered small.

We investigate the adaptive performance of a ﬁnite population on an NK
landscape as a function of the mutation rate. Depending on whether we con-
sider the mean population ﬁtness or the maximum ﬁtness in the population,
we ﬁnd diﬀerent optimal mutation rates. The mean ﬁtness is optimized at
a mutation rate that is just suﬃciently high to prevent a complete collapse
of the population into isogeny (a single genotype). At such a mutation rate,
sequence diversity is increased to a value which allows a population to explore
the genotype space more eﬃciently, without losing too much ﬁtness via accu-
mulating deleterious mutations. The maximum ﬁtness, on the other hand, is
highest when the mutation rate is so high that the population is on the verge
of delocalization. At such a mutation rate, a population is just barely able to
maintain the information discovered about the landscape, while at the same
time it can explore genotype space at an optimal speed.

2 The NK model

The NK model was introduced by Kauﬀman [12] in order to study the inﬂuence
of landscape ruggedness on adaptive evolution. The model is similar to certain
physical models of spin-glasses, in particular to the random-energy model [17].

The model is deﬁned as follows. We assume that each organism in the pop-
ulation is composed of N segments, or genes, each of which can be in one of
two possible states, designated by 0 or 1. The ﬁtness value of an organisms is
then given by the average value of the selective contribution of each of its N

fi,

where fi denotes the contribution of gene i to the ﬁtness value and is a function
of its own state and of the state of K other genes randomly chosen from the
remaining N − 1 ones. The values fi itself are drawn randomly from a uniform
distribution on the interval (0, 1]. All random variables in the NK model are
quenched, i.e., they are chosen once at the beginning of a simulation run,
and then held ﬁxed. Since the functions fi depend on the state of K diﬀerent
genes at a time, the genes in the NK model are not independent, they interact
(i.e., the model assumes epistasis between genes). By changing the number
of genes K participating in the epistatic interaction, we can shape the ﬁtness
landscape. The parameter K controls the ruggedness of the landscape. For
small values of K the landscape is smooth, becoming increasingly rugged for
higher values of K.

The inﬂuence of the parameter K on the ruggedness of the NK landscape
can be visualized with the aid of the auto-correlation function, derived in the
Appendix:

ρ(d) =

(N − K)!(N − d)!
N!(N − K − d)!

.

(2)

A fast decay of ρ(d) indicates a high degree of ruggedness, because in that case
even sequences that are only a few mutations apart contain hardly any infor-
mation about each other. If ρ(d) decays slowly, on the other hand, information
is preserved over large distances in genotype space, which is only possible if
the ﬁtness peaks in the landscape are very broad and smooth. In Fig. 1, we
have displayed ρ(d) for N = 32 and various choices of K. We ﬁnd that for
K = 1, the auto-correlation function decays very slowly, in agreement with a
smooth ﬁtness landscape. As K is increased, ρ(d) decays increasingly faster,
and the landscape becomes more rugged. In the extreme case of K = N − 1
(not displayed), ρ(d) decays to zero at d = 1, indicating that the landscape
has become completely random at that point.

In order to simulate a population evolving in an NK landscape, we use the fol-
lowing algorithm, which has been used previously by Sibani and Pedersen [18],
and is described in detail in Ref. [19]. First, we select 50% of the M sequences
in the population for reproduction. An organism is selected with probability
proportional to its ﬁtness, so that the most ﬁt individuals contribute most to
the composition of the population in the next time step. After reproduction,
the population has then reached a size of 1.5M. Now, we randomly remove one
third of the individuals, so that the population after replication and removal

consists again of M individuals. The replication mechanism is assumed to be
imperfect, and the probability of mutation for a single gene is given by the
rate u. Recombination is not taken into account in the present work.

3 Results

Our main interest in this work lies in identifying the mutation rate at which
a ﬁnite population performs “best” in an NK landscape. By “best”, we mean
that in equilibrium, and averaged over many independent runs, either the
mean or the maximum ﬁtness of the population is maximized. For an inﬁnite
population, this question is trivial, since the mean ﬁtness in equilibrium is
always maximized at zero mutation rate, and can only decay as the mutation
rate increases. For a ﬁnite population, however, a mutation rate that is too
small leads to a premature standstill in the progress of adaptation, as the
population gets trapped in local optima. A mutation rate that is too large, on
the other hand, drives the population away from very narrow but high peaks.
The optimum mutation rate therefore strikes the right balance between the
potential for barrier crossing and the risk of destabilizing ﬂuctuations once a
peak has been reached.

Figure 2 shows the mean ﬁtness as a function of time, for various values of K
and the mutation rate u. The results for diﬀerent values of K are very simi-
lar. We observe an optimal mutation rate (in terms of mean ﬁtness) around
u = 10−4 (a genomic mutation rate of µ = Nu = 0.0064). For mutation
rates below that value, the mean ﬁtness grows much more slowly. If we in-
crease the mutation rate beyond this value, we ﬁnd that while the initial
adaptation during the ﬁrst 1,000-2,000 time steps is signiﬁcantly faster, mean

4

ﬁtness actually drops. This is due to the more eﬃcient exploration of genetic
space that a higher mutation rate entails. Initially, when the population starts
out in a valley of low ﬁtness, the higher genetic diversity of a population at
a higher mutation rate results in more frequent discoveries of higher ﬁtness
genotypes. However, when equilibration is reached, the high mutation rate cre-
ates a constant inﬂux of deleterious mutations, which reduce the mean ﬁtness
in equilibrium.

In order to obtain a more detailed picture of this dynamics, we studied the
case of K = 8 more thoroughly. We recorded mean and maximum ﬁtness after
20, 000 time steps, averaged over 50 independent runs. In addition, we recorded
the average Hamming distance to the population’s consensus sequence, in
order to obtain a deeper understanding of the population structure that forms
at diﬀerent mutation rates.

Figure 3a) shows mean and maximum ﬁtness in the population as a function of
the mutation rate u. For comparison, we have also displayed the average height
of local maxima in the landscape, obtained as the average over the ﬁnal ﬁtness
of repeated adaptive walks starting from random positions in the landscape.
The mean ﬁtness reaches its maximum value around u = 0.001 (µ = 0.032),
and the maximum ﬁtness around u = 0.005 (µ = 0.16). At u = 0.1, the mean
ﬁtness has reached the value 0.5, which corresponds to the average ﬁtness of
an arbitrary sequence in a NK landscape. At this mutation rate, selection has
ceased to have any inﬂuence on the population.

For a very low mutation rate, u = 10−5, we observe that both the mean
and the maximum ﬁtness lie below the average height of local maxima in the
landscape. However, we expect them to lie exactly on the average height of
local maxima in perfect equilibration, because a ﬁnite population behaves like
an adaptive walker if the mutation rate is suﬃciently low. The discrepancy we
observe is caused by the ﬁnite time of the experiment (20,000 time steps). The
lower the mutation rate, the longer it takes until a local maximum is reached,
because the rate at which advantageous mutations are discovered is directly
proportional to u for small u. In the particular case of u = 10−5, the time
allotted for the simulations was not suﬃcient to allow complete equilibration.

For mutation rates above u = 10−4, both mean and maximum ﬁtness lie above
the height of the local maxima. This demonstrates that a ﬁnite population,
evolving at the appropriate mutation rate, can perform truly better than an
adaptive walk, due to the fact that it can cross ﬁtness barriers in situations

where an adaptive walker would simply get stuck in a local sub-optimum.

Figure 3b) shows the mean Hamming distance to the consensus sequence as a
function of the mutation rate. For small u, we witness the collapse of the pop-
ulation to an isogenic one, reﬂected in an average Hamming distance of zero.
In that regime, the dynamics of the population is only determined by the rate
at which advantageous mutations are found, as discussed above. For larger
u, the Hamming distance between sequences increases. At about u = 0.005,
which is the value at which a population discovers the highest local optima, the
average Hamming distance to the consensus sequence is already about three.
Beyond u = 0.005, the Hamming distance increases quickly, until it reaches
approximately 16 at u = 0.1. The value of 16 is exactly half the sequence
length N = 32, which means that the population is completely random at this
point. This is in agreement with the mean ﬁtness of 0.5 that we ﬁnd at this
mutation rate. At u = 0.1, the population transitions from order to disorder.
This transition corresponds to the error threshold, which was ﬁrst observed
by Eigen [20], and later found in a large variety of diﬀerent evolutionary set-
tings [21–25].

Figure 4 shows the population structure at various mutation rates in more
detail, as a histogram of the sequences’ distances to the consensus sequence.
We ﬁnd that for u = 0.005, the rate at which the population discovers the
highest local optima, the consensus sequence still makes up a signiﬁcant pro-
portion of the population, although the population’s center has already moved
away from the consensus sequence, to a distance of about two. For a slightly

higher mutation rate, u = 0.01, the population’s center moves even further
away from the consensus sequence, which in turn is represented by only 1 or
2 % of the sequences in the population or else disappears completely. A more
detailed analysis of this regime reveals that in addition to being almost ex-
tinct, the consensus sequence also starts to wander about in sequence space.
This can be seen in Fig. 5, where we have displayed the average distance to
the consensus sequence and the average distance to the consensus sequence
of 100 time steps past, as a function of time. While for u = 0.005 and lower,
the two curves lie exactly on top of each other, there are signiﬁcant deviations
between the two curves for larger u, which shows that the consensus sequence
moves for these mutation rates. However, the population has not yet crossed
the error threshold at u = 0.01, since its structure is still clearly diﬀerent from
complete randomness, and the mean ﬁtness is still above 0.5. Instead it ﬂees
the ﬁtness peak it used to inhabit (delocalizes) and settles on many adjacent,
most likely “ﬂatter” [26] ones. The population thus undergoes an additional
transition prior to experiencing the error threshold. This transition is a purely
stochastic eﬀect (i.e., it depends crucially on a ﬁnite population size). We
will refer to it as the delocalization transition, since the population becomes
delocalized and starts to drift through sequence space, re-localizing on adja-
cent (lower ﬁtness) maxima. A similar transition was previously observed by
Bonhoeﬀer and Stadler [27] in two diﬀerent landscapes, the Sherrington Kirk-
patrick spin glass and the Graph Bi-partitioning landscape, and seems to be
a generic ﬁnite population eﬀect on rugged ﬁtness landscapes.

4 Discussion

In the present work, we have considered both mean and maximum ﬁtness as
criteria for optimal adaptive performance. Which one of the two is the more
appropriate depends on the context. In biological evolution, the mean popula-
tion ﬁtness is what determines long-term evolutionary success. A population
centered around a particularly high local maximum can easily be driven to
extinction if it carries a high load of deleterious mutations and has to com-
pete with another population that has a higher mean, but lower maximum
ﬁtness [26]. In evolutionary optimization, on the other hand, we are interested
in a single particularly good solution, and the mean ﬁtness is rather meaning-
less. In that context, optimization of the maximum ﬁtness is more interesting.
In the following, we will discuss our results both in the context of biological
evolution and evolutionary optimization. We begin with biological evolution.

It has been conjectured by Eigen [28] that optimal adaptation is realized at
the verge of the error threshold, and that natural populations should therefore
evolve towards the error threshold. Here, we have found that this is clearly
not the case in NK landscapes. Rather, the mean ﬁtness (which is the relevant
quantity for natural populations, see above) is maximized at mutation rates
that generate only a moderate sequence diversity, far away from the error
threshold. Maximum rate of evolution also occurs before the error threshold,
and before the loss of the consensus sequence. The true error threshold, when
sequences diﬀuse through sequence space without relocalization, occurs at
much higher mutation rates, after the consensus sequence is long gone.

The delocalization phase for mutation rates below the error transition cor-
responds to the situation of Muller’s ratchet in classical population genet-
ics [29,30]. Muller’s ratchet is a stochastic eﬀect that occurs when either the
population size becomes too small, or the mutation rate too high, to sustain a
ﬁnite population in equilibrium. The population then starts to lose the high-
est ﬁtness individuals, a process that continues unabated until the population
dies out [31]. In contrast to that, here we do not observe a continued loss of
ﬁtness, we rather ﬁnd that the population sustains itself in the neighborhood
of high local optima. The diﬀerence between our situation and Muller’s ratchet
model is that the ratchet model assumes a single peak landscape, where only
extremely rare back mutations can compensate for the loss in ﬁtness that the
forward mutations carry. In a rugged landscape such as the NK landscape, on
the other hand, there are a large number of local optima nearby, which leads
to a signiﬁcant number of compensatory mutations (which, in eﬀect, delocalize
the population). Therefore, although the population becomes delocalized, it
can nevertheless evade continued ﬁtness loss and extinction.

Let us now discuss the implications of our ﬁndings for evolutionary optimiza-
tion. As we have mentioned above, in evolutionary optimization we are in-

9

terested in the highest possible maximum ﬁtness in the population. We have
found that in NK landscapes, this is realized for mutation rates close to the
delocalization transition. This could be utilized for evolutionary optimization
in the following way. A number of short initial runs could be used to ﬁnd
the regime in which the delocalization transition takes place. Production runs
would then be run at a mutation rate slightly below that regime.

We should also point out that the genomic mutation rates found for the NK
landscape are by no means meant to be universal. We expect to ﬁnd diﬀerent
rates for diﬀerent ﬁtness landscapes, although we expect the order of events
(highest mean ﬁtness, highest maximum ﬁtness, delocalization, error thresh-
old) with increasing mutation rate to remain the same (some of the events may
coincide). For example, it is suspected that the mutation rate of RNA viruses
is optimal at around µ ≈ 0.76 [32] while it appears to be much lower for DNA
viruses (µ ≈ 0.003 [33]). The optimal rate for ﬁnding ﬁtness maxima in the
“Royal Road” landscape [34] was found to be of the order of µ = 0.5, and
around µ = 1.0 for digital organisms [11]. In general, optimal rates depend on
the supply of advantageous mutations, and on the average height of maxima
with respect to random sequences. The presence of a delocalization transition
depends on whether or not a fair supply of “secondary” maxima can be found
near the initial ﬁtness peak.

It is interesting to compare the delocalization transition of the present work to
the behavior of an adaptive walker in a dynamic ﬁtness landscape. In Ref. [35],
it was shown that an adaptive walker can traverse the entire sequence space
if the ﬁtness landscape is changing slowly. The average ﬁtness encountered
on such walks (from peak to peak) lies above the average height of local
optima in such landscapes if the landscape changes slowly enough. Here, we
ﬁnd that a population can even traverse a static landscape if the mutation
rate is suﬃciently high. The local maxima visited by the population (after
delocalization) are of similarly high ﬁtness, as can be seen from Fig. 3a) for
u = 0.01. The main diﬀerence between the two processes is that the adaptive
walker corresponds to a population evolving at a very low mutation rate, such
that the mean ﬁtness and the maximum ﬁtness in the population coincide. The
high mutation rate necessary for delocalization, on the other hand, implies
that the average ﬁtness lies far below the maximum ﬁtness. Therefore, it is
unclear to what extent a natural population could utilize these local optima,
if at the same time the population has to suﬀer from a high load of deleterious
mutations. Nevertheless, as we have mentioned above, these local optima may
present an eﬀective means to halt Muller’s ratchet.

A Auto-correlation function in NK landscapes

The auto-correlation function ρ(d) at Hamming distance d can be calculated
with the following reasoning: we only have to calculate the probability that the
ﬁtness contribution of a single gene remains unchanged after d mutations [36].
For d = 1, this probability is (N − K)/N, since there are N − K of the total
N genes that will not aﬀect the state of the particular gene we are interested
in. For d = 2, we have then (N − K)(N − K − 1)/[N(N − 1)], since the second
mutation may hit any of the N − K − 1 genes among the N − 1 remaining
ones. Clearly, for arbitrary d, we have

ρ(d) =

(N − K)(N − K − 1) . . . (N − K − d + 1)
N(N − 1) . . . (N − d + 1)

=

(N − K)!(N − d)!
N!(N − K − d)!

.

(A.1)

Note that this derivation does not depend on whether the K − 1 interacting
genes are chosen randomly (as we assumed throughout the present paper) or
as the nearest neighbors of the gene they interact with. Even if all K genes
are chosen completely randomly for every fi (the “purely random” version of
the NK model), the result remains unaltered.

Equation (A.1) diﬀers from previously reported results for the autocorrelation
function in NK landscapes. In [36], three diﬀerent functional forms for ρ(d)
are reported for the three diﬀerent types of NK landscapes. Similar results are
given in [37–39]. The results given in [36] for the random neighbor and purely
random model are of a very simple functional form, and clearly disagree with
Eq. (A.1). The result for the nearest neighbor model, on the other hand, is
more complicated and involves a sum over combinatorial terms. A detailed
analysis reveals that the sum can actually be taken, and the resulting expres-
sion simpliﬁes to ours. Hence, the previously published correlation function

11

for the nearest neighbor case is correct, though awkward, while the other two
cases are incorrect.

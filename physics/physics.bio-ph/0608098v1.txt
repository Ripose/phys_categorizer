Traﬃc of interacting ribosomes on mRNA during protein synthesis:
eﬀects of chemo-mechanics of individual ribosomes

Many ribosomes simultaneously move on the same messenger RNA (mRNA), each synthesizing a
protein. In contrast to the earlier models, here we develope a “uniﬁed” theoretical model that not
only incorporates the mutual exclusions of the interacting ribosomes, but also describes explicitly
the mechano-chemistry of each of these individual cyclic machines during protein synthesis. Using
a combination of analytical and numerical techniques of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we
analyze the rates of protein synthesis and the spatio-temporal oraganization of the ribosomes in
this model. We also predict how these properties would change with the changes in the rates of the
various chemo-mechanical processes in each ribosome. Finally, we illustrate the power of this model
by making experimentally testable predictions on the rates of protein synthesis and the density
proﬁles of the ribosomes on some mRNAs in E-coli.

INTRODUCTION

Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nu-
cleotides on each single strand of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA). Proteins are polymers of amino acids. The syn-
thesis of proteins from DNA takes place in several stages
[1]. The two main stages in this sequence are: (i) tran-
scription, where the messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthe-
sized using the template provided by a single-stranded
DNA; and (ii) translation where the codons (triplets of
nucleotides) on the mRNA are sequentially decoded and
a protein (or, more precisely, a polypeptide) is synthe-
sized. Thse two stages may, however, overlap and trans-
lation of a mRNA can begin even before transcription
is completed [2]. Translation is carried out by the ribo-
some [3]. From the perspective of physics, ribosome is
one of the largest and most sophisticated macromlecular
machines within the cell [4]; it is essentially a “protein-
making motor protein” [5] that consumes chemical en-
ergy for its mechanical movements [6]. In this paper we
focus exclusively on translation by ribosomes.

Most often many ribosomes move simultaneously on
the same mRNA strand while each synthesises a pro-
tein. It has been realized for a long time that the inter-
ribosome interactions cannot be ignored except at ex-
tremely low densities. The collective movement of ribo-
somes on a single mRNA strand has superﬁcial similari-
ties with vehicular traﬃc [7, 8, 9, 10] and, therefore, will
be referred to as ribosome traﬃc. Our main aim is to
develope a theoretical model of the collective movement
of the ribosomes on a mRNA strand as well as to inves-
tigate the interplay of intra-ribosomal chemo-mechanics
and inter-ribosome interactions.

In all the earlier models of ribosome traﬃc [11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], the entire ribosome is modelled

as a single “self-propelled particle” ignoring its molecular
composition and architecture. Moreover, in these mod-
els the inter-ribosome interactions are captured through
hard-core mutual exclusion. Furthermore, the dynam-
ics of the system is formulated in terms of rules that
are essentially straightforward extensions of the totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) [20]. In
the TASEP a particle can hop forward to the next lat-
tice site, with a probability q per time step, if and only
if the target site is empty; updating is done throughout
either in parallel or in the random-sequential manner. In
fact, TASEP is one of the simplest models of systems
of interacting driven particles [21, 22]. The TASEP-like
earlier models of ribosome traﬃc capture the eﬀects of
all the chemical reactions and conformational changes,
which lead to the translocation of a ribosome from one
codon to the next, by a single parameter, namely, the
probability of hopping, per unit time, of a ribosome from
one lattice site to the next.

In reality, as mentioned earlier, a ribosome is a molec-
ular motor whose mechanical movement is coupled to its
biochemical cycle. In this paper we develope a model that
not only incorporates the inter-ribosome steric interac-
tions (mutual exclusion), but also captures explicitly the
essential steps in the intra-ribosome chemo-mechanical
processes, including peptide bond formation and translo-
cations driven by GTP (guanine triphosphate) hydroly-
sis.

Our modelling strategy for incorporating the biochem-
ical cycle of ribosomes is similar to that followed in the
recent work [23] on single-headed kinesin motors KIF1A.
However, the implementation of the strategy is more
diﬃcult here not only because of the higher complex-
ity of composition, architecture and mechano-chemical
processes of the ribosomal machinery and but also be-
cause of the sequence heterogeneity of the mRNA track
[24, 25]. Our modelling strategy has enabled us to achieve
a synthesis- in the low-density limit, our model accounts
for the protein synthesis by a single isolated ribosome

while at higher densities the same model predicts not
only the rate of protein synthesis but also the collective
density proﬁle of the ribosomes on the mRNA strand.

Our approach is based on a stochastic chemical kinetic
model which makes no commitments to either power
stroke or Brownian ratchet mechanism [26, 27, 28] of
molecular motors. The main quantities of our interest
are the rates of protein synthesis and the density proﬁle
of the ribosomes on the mRNA strand. Both these have
played key roles in the studies of dynamical phases and
boundary-induced non-equilibrium phase transitions in
driven-diﬀusive lattice gas models [20, 22]. But, in con-
trast to the earlier models of ribosome traﬃc, we explore
the dependence of these quantities on the rate constants
for various steps of its chemo-mechanical cycle in real
time and also plot the phase diagrams in planes spanned
by experimentally accessible parameters.

The paper is organized as follows: Because of the in-
terdisciplinary nature of the topic investigated in this pa-
per, we present in section II a summary of the essential
biochemical and mechanical processes during a complete
operational cycle of a single ribosome. We present a brief
critical review of the earlier models in section III followed
by a description of our model in section IV so as to high-
light the novel features of our model. We report our
results on this model with periodic boundary conditions
in sections V and VI and those with open boundary con-
ditions in section VII. We summarize the main results
and draw conclusions in section VIII.

II. SUMMARY OF THE ESSENTIAL
CHEMO-MECHANICAL PROCESSES

The process of translation itself can be divided into
three main stages: (a) initiation, during which the ribo-
somal subunits assemble on the initiator codon on the
mRNA strand, (b) elongation, during which the nascent
polypeptide gets elongated by the formation of peptide
bonds with new amino acids, and (c) termination, dur-
ing which the process of translation gets terminated at
the stop codon and the polypeptide is relased. In this
paper we shall be concerned mostly with the process of
elongation.

Each ribosome consists of two parts which are usually
referred to as the larger and the smaller subunits. There
are four binding sites on each ribosome. Of these, three
sites (called E, P, A), which are located in the larger
subunit, bind to aa-tRNA, while the fourth binding site,
which is located on the smaller subunit, binds to the
mRNA strand. The translocation of the smaller subunit
of each ribosome on the mRNA track is coupled to the
biochemical processes occuring in the larger subunit. The
chemo-mechanical cycle of a ribosome is drawn in ﬁg.1
and three major steps in this cycle are sketched schemat-
ically in ﬁg.2.

Let us begin the biochemical cycle in the elongation
phase with state 1, (ﬁgure 1) where a tRNA is bound

to the site P. A tRNA-EF-Tu complex now binds to site
A and the system makes a transition from the state 1
to the state 2. As long as the EF-Tu is attached to the
tRNA, codon-anticodon binding can take place, but the
peptide bond formation is prevented. The EF-Tu has a
GTP part which is hydrolized to GDP, driving the tran-
sition from state 2 to 3. Following this, a phosphate
group leaves, resulting in the intermediate state 4. This
hydrolysis, ﬁnally, releases the EF-Tu, and the peptide
bond formation is now possible. After this step, EF-G,
in the GTP bound form, comes in contact with the ribo-
some. This causes the tRNAs to shift from site P to E
and from site A to P, site A being occupied by the EF-G,
resulting in the state 5. Hydrolysis of the GTP to GDP
then releases the EF-G and this is accompanied by the
transition of the system from the state 5 to the state 6.
The transition from the state 6 to state 7 is accompanied
by conformatinal changes that are responsible for pulling
the mRNA-binding smaller subunit by one step forward.
Finally, the tRNA on site A is released, resulting in the
completion of one biochemical cycle; in the process the
ribosome moves forward by one codon (i.e., one step on
the lattice).

III. BRIEF REVIEW OF THE EARLIER
MODELS

To our knowledge, MacDonald, Gibbs and coworkers
[11, 12] developed the ﬁrst quantitative theory of simulta-
neous protein synthesis by many ribosomes on the same
mRNA strand. Their model is shown schematically in
ﬁg.3. The sequence of the codons on a given mRNA was
represented by the corresponding sequence of the equi-
spaced sites of a regular one-dimensional lattice. Each
of the ribosomes was modelled by a self-propelled parti-
cle of size ℓ in the units of the lattice constant; thus, ℓ
is an integer. On the lattice the steric repulsion of the
ribosomes was taken into account by imposing the con-
dition of mutual exclusion, i.e., no site of the lattice can
be simultaneously covered by more than one particle.

The dynamics of the system was formulated in terms

of the following update rules:
An extended particle, whose forward edge is located at
the site i, can hop forward by one lattice spacing with
the forward hopping rate q(i) provided the target site is
not already covered another extended particle. More-
over, initiation and termination were assumed to take
place with the corresponding rates α and β, respectively,
which are not necessarily equal to any of the other rate
constants. For the sake of simplicity of analytical calcu-
lations, it was assumed [11, 12] that qi = q, irrespective
of i. This, eﬀectively, replaces an intrinsically inhomoge-
neous process by a homogeneous one which ignores the

FIG. 3: Schematic representation of TASEP-type models of
protein synthesis. The lattice of rectangular cells represents
the codon sequence on a mRNA while each rectangular block

cle” which repesents a ribosome.

dependence of the biochemical steps on the codon or on
the corresponding tRNA. In such special situations, this
model reduced to TASEP without any defect or disorder,
except that the allowed size of the “extended” hopping
particles are multiples of the lattice spacing.

Periodic boundary conditions are less realistic than
open boundary conditions for capturing protein synthe-
sis by a theoretical model. Nevertheless, if one imposes
periodic boundary conditions on this simpliﬁed version
of the model, the steady-state solution is uniform, i.e.,
the probability of ﬁnding the ribosome at a given site is
independent of the site i. The steady-state ﬂux J of the
ribosomes is deﬁned as the average number of the ribo-
somes crossing an arbitrary codon per unit time. In the
steady-state corresponding to periodic boundary condi-
tions, the ﬂux of the ribosomes, in the absence of any
backward hopping, is given by [11, 29]

where ρ is the number density of the ribosomes; ifN is
the total number of ribosomes on the lattice of length L,
then ρ = N/L. The corresponding average speed of the
ribosomes is given by < v >= J/ρ.

−

(cid:21)

Because of the close analogy with vehicular traﬃc, we
shall refer to the ﬂux-density relation as the fundamental
diagram [7]. The fundamental diagram implied by the
expression (1) exhibits a maximum at the density ρm
and the value of ﬂux at this maximum is Jm where

ρm =

1
√ℓ(√ℓ + 1)

and Jm =

q
(√ℓ + 1)2

.

(2)

Only in the special case ℓ = 1, this fundamental diagram
is symmetric about ρ = 1/2 which is referred to as the

particle-hole symmetry in the traﬃc literature [7]; the
maximum shifts to higher density with increasing ℓ.

The ribosome density proﬁle in the model developed by
Macdonald et al. has been investigated in detail by solv-
ing the equations numerically [11, 12, 30]. Similar results
on the synthesis rate, ribosome density proﬁle and several
other interesting quantities have been calculated either
by numerical solution of the equations or by carrying out
direct computer simulations of this model as well as some
other closely related models [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].

None of the existing quantitative models mentioned
above distinguishes between the larger and the smaller
subunits of the ribosome. Instead, in those models, the
entire macromolecular machine is represented by a sin-
gle “extended particle”. Moreover, the simple dynamics
does not account for the detailed biochemical cycle of
each single ribosome and how these chemical reactions
drive its translocation from one codon to the next one.
Instead, the entire complexity of its mechano-chemistry
is captured by one single parameter, namely, the eﬀective
probability q of its hopping forward from one lattice site
to the next, which is equivalent to the rate constant for
the forward reaction that elongates the protein by one
amino acid.

IV. THE MODEL

A. Components, structures and architectures

The model is shown schematically in ﬁg.4. Our model
diﬀers from all earlier models in the way we capture the
structure, biochemical cycle and translocation of each ri-
bosome. But, our strategy for modelling the mRNA is
exactly identical to that followed in the literature since
the pioneering work of MacDonald, Gibbs and coworkers
[11, 12].

−

We represent the single-stranded mRNA chain, con-
sisting of L codons, by a one-dimensional lattice of length
L + ℓ
1 where each of the ﬁrst L sites from the left
represents a single codon. We label the sites of the lat-
tice by the integer index i. The left-to-right sequence of
the sites represent the codon sequence from 5′-to-3′ end
of the mRNA and, therefore, each ribosome moves from
left to right on the lattice; the site i = 1 represents the
start codon while the site i = L corresponds to the stop
codon.

To begin with, we shall consider a perfectly periodic
lattice with identical sites. This simpliﬁed situation is
similar to the homogeneous template considered in the
pioneering works in ref.[11, 12] and most of the subse-
quent works in the literature. However, in this paper,
we shall also model protein synthesis in E-coli using the
actual sequence of codons in a few mRNAs transcribed
from real genes which are intrinsically inhomogeneous.

In principle, during actual translation it may be nec-
essary ﬁrst to unwind the mRNA, at least locally, to get
access to the codon sequence on a single-stranded mRNA.

FIG. 4: A schematic representation of the model. (a) A car-
toon of a single ribosome that explicitly shows the three bind-
ing sites E, P and A on the larger subunit which is represented
by the ellipsoidal lobe. The rectangular lower part repre-
sents the smaller subunit of the ribosome. (b) The mRNA is
represented as a one-dimensional lattice where each site cor-
responds to one single codon. The smaller subunit of each
ribosome covers ℓ codons (ℓ = 2 in this ﬁgure) at a time.

Interestingly, the ribosome itself exhibits helicase activity
for this purpose [37]; this function is somewhat similar
to the helicase activity of the RNA polymerase which
is known to unwind double-stranded DNA during tran-
scription. However, we shall not include this helicase
activity of the ribosome explicitly in our model and as-
sume that an active ribosome translocates on an eﬀec-
tively one-dimensional lattice.

The small sub-unit of the ribosome, which is known
to bind with the mRNA, is represented by an extended
particle of length ℓ which is expressed in the units of the
size of a codon (see ﬁg.4). We assume the simplest form
of mutual interactions among the ribosomes. These do
not interact if they do not touch each other. However,
if two ribosomes touch each other, the leading ribosome
(which contains a longer nascent protein) will be assumed
to be totally unaﬀected by the following ribosome while
the following ribosome will fail to move forward as long
as the leading one remains in its current position. Thus,
in our model, the small subunit of each ribosome covers ℓ
codons at a time; no lattice site is allowed to be covered
simultaneously by more than one overlapping ribosome.
Irrespective of the length ℓ, each ribosome moves forward
by only one site in each step as it must translate succes-
sive codons one by one.

TABLE I: Rate constants obtained from experimental data
for E-coli [38, 39].

The initiation step is known to be the rate-limiting pro-
cess for translation of many mRNAs and involves many
regulatory molecules. But, since our model is not in-
tended to describe initiation in detail, we represent initi-
ation by a single parameter α. Whenever the ﬁrst ℓ sites
on the mRNA are vacant this group of sites is allowed
to be covered by a ribosome, from the pool of unbound
ribosomes, with the probability α in the time interval ∆t
(in all our numerical calculations we take ∆t = 0.001 s).
Since α is the probability of attachment in time ∆t, the
probability of attachment per unit time (which we call
e−ωα×∆t (see
ωα) is the solution of the equation α = 1
−
appendix A for the detailed explanation).

Similarly, since we are not interested in modelling the
termination of translation with all the molecular level
processes in detail, we describe termination in our model
by a single parameter β; whenever the rightmost ℓ sites
of the mRNA lattice are covered by a ribosome, i.e., the
ribosome is bound to the L-th codon, the ribosome gets
detached from the mRNA with probability β in the time
interval ∆t.

So far as the elongation stage is concerned, all the
earlier models describe elongation of the protein by one
amino acid also in terms of a single parameter, namely,
the rate q of hopping of a ribosome from one codon to
the next. In contrast, we model the chemo-mechanics of
elongation in detail.

In the elongation stage, we have identiﬁed seven dis-
tinct states of the ribosome in each cycle which have been
described in detail in section II (shown schematically in
ﬁg.1). It is possible that there are transient intermediate
states and each step mentioned above may have to be
divided into substeps. Although, in principle, our model
can be trivially extended to incorporate such ﬁner details,
we do not attempt such extensions of the model here. In-
stead, in setting up the equations below, we simplify the
model. Throughout this paper, we do not consider ex-

tRNA. The simpliﬁed cycle of the model ribosome has

ence in the structures of the two elongation factors and
since their binding mechanisms are also similar [5], we
assume that the rate constants ωh1 and ωh2 are equal.
The values of the rate constants used in our calculations
are listed in table I.

C. Quantities of interest

Note that the number density ρ of the ribosomes is
given by N/L where N is the total number of the ex-
tended particles and L is the length of the lattice. Ob-
viously, the lattice is fully covered when N ℓ = L and,
therefore, the maximum possible number density of the
extended particles is ρmax = 1/ℓ. One can also deﬁne
[14] the coverage density ρcov = N ℓ/L. From now on-
wards, the term density would imply number density, if
not stated otherwise.

In the context of ribosomal traﬃc, the position, aver-
age speed and ﬂux of ribosomes have interesting inter-
pretations in terms of protein synthesis. The position of
a ribosome on the mRNA also gives the length of the
nascent polypeptide it has already synthesized. The av-
erage speed of a ribosome is also a measure of the av-
erage rate of polypeptide elongation. The ﬂux of the
ribosomes gives the total rate of polypeptide synthesis
from the mRNA strand, i.e., the number of completely
synthesized polypeptides per unit time.

The lifetime of a typical eukaryotic mRNA is of the or-
der of hours whereas the time taken to synthesize an en-
tire protein by translating the mRNA is of the order of a
few minutes. Consequently, most often protein synthesis
takes place under steady-sate conditions. Therefore, al-
though we shall formulate time-dependent equations for
protein synthesis, we shall almost exclusively focus on
the steady-state properties of these models in this paper.

D. Methods of calculation

Most of our analytical calculations have been per-
formed in the mean-ﬁeld approximation. In order to test
the accuracy of the approximate analytical results, we
have also carried out computer simulations of our model.
Since we found very little diﬀerence in the results for
systems size L = 300 and those for larger systems, all
of our productions runs were carried out using L = 300.
We have used random sequential updating which corre-
sponds to the master equations formulated for the analyt-
ical description. In each run of the computer simulations
the data for the ﬁrst ﬁve million time steps were dis-
carded to ensure that the system, indeed, reached steady
state. The data were collected in the steady state over
the next ﬁve millon time steps. Thus, each simulation
run extended over a total of ten million time steps. For
example, the average steady-state ﬂux was obtained by
averaging over the last ﬁve million time steps.

V. RESULTS IN THE SPECIAL CASE ℓ = 1

Typically, a single ribosome itself covers about twelve
codons (i.e., ℓ = 12), and interacts with others by mutual
exclusion. However, as a ﬁrst step, we consider the spe-
cial case ℓ = 1, with periodic boundary conditions. This
is not equivalent to TASEP because of the incorporation
of the biochemical cycle in the dynamics of the model.
We set up the Master equations for the process of trans-
lation in this special case ℓ = 1, and then solve them
in the mean ﬁeld approximation. We compare our ana-
lytical results with the corresponding numerical results
which we obtain by computer simulations.

The mean-ﬁeld estimate of the ﬂux, which is given by
the equation (12), has been plotted against ρ in ﬁgure
6 for various values of ωa along with the corresponding
numerical data obtained from our computer simulations
of the model. We ﬁnd a fairly good agreement between
the results of mean ﬁeld approximation and computer
simulations, especially in the low density region, and for
large ωa. This is expected because when the density is
low, the ribosomes are practically independent of each
other. As the density increases, this in no longer the
case, and the basic mean ﬁeld estimate deviates more
and more from the corresponding simulation data.

Both mean-ﬁeld theory and computer simulations
demonstrate that, for any given density ρ, higher ωa gives

7

rise to larger J; this is consistent with one’s intuitive ex-
pectation because higher concentration of tRNA reduce
the waiting time of the ribosome at a codon. Since none
of the earlier theoretical models separately account for
the two processes associated with the rate constants ωa
and ωh2, this speciﬁc feature of protein synthesis could
not be captured by those models. At small ωa, the ava-
ialbility of of tRNA may, indeed, be the rate-limiting pro-
cess during polypeptide elongation. But, if it incresaes to
suﬃciently large level, other processes may replace it as
the rate-liming step; this is evident from the saturation
of the ﬂux with increasing ωa shown in ﬁg.7.

Note that the fundamental diagram shown in ﬁg.6 is
not symmetric about ρ = 1/2 and the peak appears at
a density larger than 1/2. Moreover, the position of the
peak shifts to higher densities with decreasing chemical
rate constants. In the next subsection we compare our
model with the Fukui-Ishibashi (FI) model [40] of ve-
hicular traﬃc to explain the physical origin of an this
interesting generic feature of the fundamental diagrams
in our model of ribosome traﬃc.

C. Relation with models of vehicular traﬃc

The TASEP has been extended over the last ﬁfteen
years to develope many models to capture various aspects
of vehicular traﬃc [7]. The Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS)
model, which is essentially an extension of the TASEP,
is the most widely used minimal model of vehicular traf-
ﬁc. It has been extended further to develope many other
more realistic “particle-hopping” models which capture
some phenomena that are not accounted for by the NS
model. Fukui and Ishibashi [40] formulated a somewhat
diﬀerent minimal model which is less realistic than NS
model for vehicular traﬃc.

Interestingly, the TASEP itself was developed origi-
nally [11] to model essential features of ribosome traf-
ﬁc. However, success of TASEP-like models of vehicu-
lar traﬃc and recent advances in molecular motors with
the help of new powerful experimental techniques have
led to a revival of the TASEP-like modelling strategy
for traﬃc of wide varieties of molecular motors [8, 9].
These include, for example, traﬃc of cytoskeletal mo-
tors [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] and that of motors
that move on single-stranded DNA tracks [49, 50, 51],
etc. Most of these focus on generic features rather than
speciﬁc details of any particular motor.

1. Comparison with the Fukui Ishibashi model

The FI model [40] is a “particle-hopping” model for ve-
hicular traﬃc on single-lane highways. The update rules
of the FI model are as follows:
If Vmax or more sites in front of the i-th vehicle is empty
at the time step t, then it has a probability 1
p to move
forward by Vmax sites and a probability p to move for-

−

−

ward by Vmax
1 sites in the time step t + 1. However,
if only d sites (d < Vmax) in front of the i-th vehicle are
empty at time t then it moves by d sites in the next time
step. Note that, for general Vmax > 1, in the FI model,
(a) the increase of speed of the vehicles is not necessarily
gradual and (b) the stochastic delay applies only to the
vehicles that can move with the highest allowed velocity
Vmax. However, the FI model reduces to the NS model in
the special case Vmax = 1 and the ﬂux Vs density curve
exhibits a maximum at the density ρ = 0.5. As Vmax
increases, the location of the maximum shifts to lower
values of ρ as the vehicles feel stronger hindrance created
by the leading vehicles. This trend of variation of the
location of the maximum on the ﬂux Vs density curve
is also shared by the NS model for the same underlying
mechanism.

Thus, the vehicles in the FI model are allowed to move
by more than one site in each time step. The situation
in our model of ribosome traﬃc is just the opposite- the
intermediate chemical states prevent the ribosome from
moing even one site in one time step, because the ribo-
some may simply make a transition from one chemical
state to another without moving from one codon to the
next. In a sense, so far as the spatial movement of the
ribosome is concerned, our model is like the FI model
with fractional Vmax, i.e., Vmax = 1
m , where, m = is the
number of intermediate chemical states [65].

In order to make a direct comparison of the two models,
we consider the deterministic limit p = 0 (i.e., hopping
probability = 1) in the FI model and set the probabilities
of all the transitions between various chemical states in
our ribosome traﬃc model to unity. We now derive the
fundamental relations for both these models (in the spe-
cial cases mentioned) under mean-ﬁeld approximations
imposing periodic boundary conditions.

Let P (i, t) be the probability of occupation of a the
site i, at time t, by a vehicle. In the steady state, the
pobability that in a time step, a particle crosses site i is
given by:

J =

Moreover, owing to the periodic bounday condition, all
sites are equivalent. Therefore, P (i) = ρ, independent
of i, where ρ is the global density of the vehicles. The
expression (13) for the ﬂux can thus be summed to yield

J = (1

The mean ﬁeld ﬂux for the ribosome model, in the

FIG. 8: Mean-ﬁeld estimates of ﬂux in the Fukui-Ishinashi
model are plotted against the denity of the vehicles for sev-
eral diﬀerent values of n. In the context of vehicular traﬃc
only integer values of n are allowed; the fractional values of
n are used only to establish the relation between the Fukui-
Ishibashi model and our model of ribosome traﬃc.

The mean ﬁeld fundamental diagrams for FI model
and those for our model of ribosome traﬃc have been
plotted in ﬁgure 8. Increase of n in the FI model causes
the density corresponding to the maximum ﬂux to shift
to lower values. Similarly, incease of m in the model of
ribosome traﬃc causes this point to shift to higher values
of density.

VI. RESULTS IN THE GENERAL CASE WITH
ARBITRARY ℓ

Now we consider the general case of our model where
the smaller subunit of each ribosomes has a length ℓ > 1.
Position of such a ribosome will be referred to by the inte-
ger index of the lattice site covered by the leftmost site of
the smaller subunit. Let P (i
j) be the conditional prob-

ability that, given a ribosome at site i, there is another
ribosome at site j. Then, Q(i

A. Steady state solution under periodic boundary
condition for arbitrary ℓ

If periodic boundary conditions are imposed, all the
sites can be treated on equal footing in the steady state.
Therefore, the corresponding ﬂux of the ribosomes J can

Q(1
1 + ℓ): given a ribosome at the site i = 1, what is
|
the probability that the site i = ℓ + 1 is empty? Since it
is given that the site i = 1 is occupied by a ribosome, the
1 ribosomes must be distributed among
remaining N

the remaining L

urations where i = ℓ also occupied; this is given by
Z(L

The ﬂux obtained from (27) has been plotted in ﬁgure
(9) for various values of ℓ. This trend of variation with
ℓ was also observed in the pioneering work of MacDon-
ald et al. [11] in their simpler model. By diﬀerentiating
equation (27), we obtain that the density ρ∗ correspond-
ing to the maximum of the ﬂux is the solution of the

We recover the equation (2) for ρm in the appropriate
0. Our theoretical predictions in ﬁg.9 are
limit Ωh2 →
also in good agreement with the corresponding simula-
tion data.

In order to see the eﬀects of varying the rates of some
of the biochemical transitions, we have plotted the fun-
damental diagram in ﬁg.10 for two diﬀerent situations,
namely, ωh1 = 10ωh2 with ωh2 = 10 s−1 and ωh2 = 10ωh1
with ωh1 = 10 s−1. The fundamental diagrams in these
two situations turn out to be almost identical; this is
a consequence of the fact that for the set of parameter
rages used in this ﬁgure, neither ωh1 nor ωh2 corresponds
to the rate limiting process.

We have plotted the fundamental diagrams of the
model in ﬁg.11 for three diﬀerent diﬀerent values of ωa,
namely, ωa = 2.5 s−1, ωa = 25 s−1 and ωa = 250 s−1
using both mean-ﬁeld theory and computer simulations.
The results show that at suﬃciently small values of ωa,
where the availability of the tRNA is the rate-limiting
process, the ﬂux increases rapidly with increasing ωa.

However, the rate of this increase decreases with increas-
ing ωa and, eventually ﬂux essentially satuates when ωa
is so large that the availability of tRNA is no longer the
rate limiting process. Very similar trend of variation of
ﬂux with ωg is observed in ﬁg.12 when ωg is varied over
three orders of magnitude. In contrast, the ﬂux has been
observed to vary at signiﬁcant rate even at the highest
values of k2 when is varied over three orders of magnitude
(see ﬁg.13 indicating that saturation of ﬂux with respect
to k2 variation sets in at even higher values of k2.

VII. RESULTS FOR OPEN BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS

An open boundary condition is more realistic than pe-
riodic boundary conditions for describing ribosome traf-
ﬁc on mRNA. The new parameters which enter into the
model are α and β which we have already introduced
in section IV. These are associated with initiation and
termination of translation.

A. Mean ﬁeld analysis of steady state under open
boundary conditions

In this subsection we calculate the ﬂux of ribosomes
(and, hence, the rate of protein synthesis) using a mean
ﬁeld theoretical approach similar to that developed by
Shaw et al. [15]. The approximation involved is that the
conditional probability of site i + ℓ being empty, given
that site i has a ribosome in it, is replaced simply by the
probability of site i being empty, given no other condi-
tion.

If Pi is the probability of there being a ribosome at site
i, then the probability of there being a hole at site j is
ℓ−1
given by 1
s=0 Pj−s. Also, since α is the probability
of attachment in time ∆t, the probability of attachment
P
per unit time (which we call ωα) is the solution to the
e−ωα×∆t. It is now straightforward to
equation α = 1
set up the master equations for the probabilities Pµ(i):

36); the results are shown by the continuous curves in
ﬁgures 14(a) and 14(b). These mean-ﬁeld estimates are
in excellent agreement with the corresponding numerical
data obtained from computer simulations of the model.
Moreover, the rates of protein synthesis corresponding to
the typical rate constants given in table I are in the same
order of magnitude as those observed experimentally [1].
The average density proﬁles observed at several values of
ωh and α are also shown in the insets of ﬁgs.14(a) and
(b), respectively.

Figures 14(a) and (b) show how the current gradu-
ally increases and, ﬁnally, saturates as ωh (in (a)) and α
(in (b)) increase; the saturation value of the current is
numerically equal to the maximum current obtained in
the corresponding closed system with periodic boundary
conditions. The average density proﬁles in the insets of
the ﬁgures 14(a) and (b) establish that the average den-
sity of the ribosomes decreases with increasing ωh, but
increases with increasing α, gradually saturating in both
the cases. These observations are consistent with the
scenario of phase transition from one dynamical phase to
another, as predicted by the extremal current hypothesis
which will be considered later in this section.

So far we have been assuming perfect homogenity of
the mRNA track, in the sense that the transition rates
are independent of the position of the ribosome along the
strand. However, in real gene sequences, this assumption
is not very realistic. First of all, diﬀerent codons appear
on a mRNA with diﬀerent frequencies. Moreover, in a
given cell, not all the tRNA species, which correspond
to diﬀerent codon species, are equally abundant. There
are some codons which appear on mRNAs less frequently
than other more common codons. Interestingly, because

6
6
of evolutionary adaptations, the concentrations of tRNA
species which correspond to rare codons are also propor-
tionately low [52].

The eﬀect of rare codons and the relative scarcity of
corresponding tRNA on the rate of protein synthesis has
been investigated both experimentally as well as theo-
retically [34, 35]. Rare codons become more eﬀective
in blocking ribosomes if these codons are arranged in a
compact cluster rather than being dispersed uniformly
all along the mRNA strand [18, 53]. Besides, amino acid
starvation of a “hungry” ribosome can lead to a substitu-
tion of the required scarce amino acid species by a more
readily available species thereby causing a translation er-
ror [35]. However, almost all the theoretical results on
the eﬀects of sequence inhomoneities have been obtained
so far by computer simulations of the earlier TASEP-like
models [19].

In order to account for the inhomogeneity of the
mRNA track, we now extend our homogeneous model
assuming that the rate constant ωa of the attachment of
the tRNA to the site A of the ribosome is site-dependent
(i.e., dependent on the codon species). More precisely,
for a ribosome located at the i-th site, we multiply the
numerical value of ωa, which we used earlier for the hypo-
thetical homogeneous mRNA, by a multiplicative factor
that is proportional to the relative concentration of the
tRNA associated with the i-th codon [52, 54].

In our studies, we focus on genes of Escherichia coli K-
12 strain MG1655 [55]. Although analytical calculations
have been reported [56, 57, 58, 59] for Brownian ratchet
models with quenched disorder, to our knowledge, no
method for analytical calculations of rate of protein syn-
thesis has been developed so far for inhomogeneous, but
correlated, gene sequence. Therefore, we have obtained
the results numerically by carrying out computer sim-
ulations using the hypothesis mentioned above for the
choice of the numerical values for the diﬀerent species of
codons. The results are plotted with discrete points in
ﬁg.14. The lower ﬂux observed for real genes, as com-
pared to that for homogeneous mRNA, is caused by the
codon speciﬁcity of the available tRNA molecules.

C. Phase diagrams from extremal current
hypothesis

We shall treat α, ωa, ωh1 and ωh2 as the experimentally
controlable parameters. We shall plot the phase diagrams
of the model in planes spanned by pairs of these param-
eters. We shall plot these phase diagrams using equation
(27), and an extremum principle which was originally
introduced by Krug [60], stated in its general form by
Popkov and Sch¨utz [61] and eﬀectively utilized in sev-
eral later works [62, 63] in the context of driven diﬀusive
lattice gas models.

In this approach, one imagines that the left and right
ends of the system are connected to two reservoirs with
the appropriate number densities ρ− and ρ+ of particles

[61], the extrema principle states that

In the present context of our model the expression (27)
for J(ρ) exhibits a single maximum at ρ = ρ∗ where ρ∗
is given by the equation (29). Moreover, we take ρ+ = 0,
i.e., β = 1, because we assume that the ribosome is re-
leased from the mRNA as soon as it reachs the stop
codon; this is justiﬁed by the fact that, normally, ter-
mination is not the rate limiting step in the process of
protein synthesis. Therefore, the extremal current hy-
pothesis implies that in our model

All the results derived in this section exploiting this ex-
tremum principle are approximate because the expression
(27), which we use for the expression of J(ρ), has been
derived in the mean-ﬁeld approximation. Next, follow-
ing arguments similar those followed in all earlier appli-
cations of this extremum principle, we now derive the
appropriate expressions for ρ−.

VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The collective movement of ribosomes on a mRNA
strand has been viewed for a long time as traﬃc ﬂow
of molecular motors [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
The physical properties of the non-equilibrium steady
states of such systems of interacting “self-propelled”
objects have been investigated in recent years using
the techniques of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
[7, 8, 9, 10]. However, all the earlier TASEP-like models
of ribosome traﬃc treat each ribosome as an “extended
particle” and capture the eﬀects of the entire chemo-
mechanocal cycle that drives the translocation of the ri-
bosome from one codon to the next by a single parameter,
namely, hopping probability q.

In reality, a ribosome is not just a particle but one
of the most complex natural nanomachines [3]. Thus,
the underlying implicit assumption of TASEP type mod-
els of ribosome traﬃc is that the numerical value of q
is determined by the rate-limiting step in the mechano-
chemical cycle of a ribosome. Therefore, TASEP type
models can successfully explain those collective propeties
of ribosome traﬃc which do not depend on the detailed
mechano-chemical cycle of individual ribosomes. On the

14

other hand, fundamental understanding of the interplay
of the diﬀerent steps of this cycle will not only provide
deep insight into the mechanisms of regulation of gene
expression, but may also ﬁnd biomedical applications as
ribosome is the target of many antibiotics [64].

In this paper we have developed a model of ribosome
traﬃc during protein synthesis by explicitly incorporat-
ing all the major steps in the mechano-chemical cycle
of each ribosome, in addition to the mutual exclusion
of the ribosomes arising from their steric interactions.
Thus, our work can also be viewed as an interesting ex-
tension of TASEP motivated by the chemo-mechanics of
ribosomes during the process of protein synthesis.

We have calculated the ﬂux of the ribosomes, which is
directly related to the rate of protein synthesis, both ana-
lytically and numerically. Our approximate analytical re-
sults have been derived in the mean-ﬁeld approximation
and compared with the corresponding numerical data ob-
tained by carrying out computer simulations. We have
studied the model under both periodic and open bound-
ary conditions. Moreover, in the latter case we have
also calculated the average density proﬁles of the ribo-
somes on the mRNA track in all the dynamical phases of
the system. Furthermore, we have determined the phase
boundaries on the phase diagrams by using the extremum
current hypothesis [61].

In contrast to all the earlier models of ribosome traﬃc,
we have investigated the eﬀects of varying the rate con-
stants for the various steps of the mechano-chemical cycle
of single ribosomes on the ﬂux as well as on the density
proﬁles. For each of the rate constants, we have shown
that the current eventually saturates and the correspond-
ing step of the mechano-chemical cycle is no longer rate
limiting. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the se-
quence inhomogeneity of mRNA templates transcribed
from real gene sequences slows down protein synthesis.
We have illustrated this slowing down by showing the
reduction in the ﬂux in the case of a few real mRNA se-
quences for E-coli as compared to the ﬂux of ribosomes
on the corresponding hypothetical homogeneous track.
Besides, we have calculated the ﬂux in real time (un-
like arbitrary units used in most of the earlier works).
Our results for the rates of protein synthesis are in good
agreement with the corresponding experimental data.

−

Following the traditional approach to phase diagrams
of TASEP under open boundary conditions, all the earlier
works on TASEP like models of ribosome traﬃc reported
phase diagrams in the α
β plane. But, we have plotted
the phase diagrams in planes spanned by experimentally
accessible parameters that include the concentrations of
aa-tRNA and GTP-bound elongation factors. We hope
the predictions of our theoretical model will stimulate
further experimental studies for more accurate quantita-
tive data.

where [A]◦ is the concentration of A at t = 0. The left
hand side of (45) gives the fraction of A molecules re-

acted in time ∆t, and is thus the probability that a sin-
gle molecule of A will be transformed into B, in time ∆t.
If this time interval ∆t is very small, we can expand the
right hand side of equation (45). Diﬀerentiation this with
restect to time gives the probability of transition per unit

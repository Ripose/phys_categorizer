Abstract

The tridimensional conﬁguration and the twist density of helical rods with varying cross section

radius are studied within the framework of the Kirchhoﬀ rod model. It is shown that the twist

density increases when the cross section radius decreases. Some tridimensional conﬁgurations of

helix-like rods are displayed showing the eﬀects of the nonhomogeneity considered here. Since the

helix-like solutions of the nonhomogeneous rods do not present constant curvature and torsion a

set of diﬀerential equations for these quantities is presented. We discuss the results and possible

consequences.

Helical ﬁlaments are tridimensional structures universally found in Nature. They can

be seen in very small sized systems, as biomolecules [1] and bacterial ﬁbers [2], and in

macroscopic ones, as ropes, strings, and climbing plants [3, 4, 5]. All these objects have in

common the fact that the mathematical geometric properties of the 3D-space curve related

to their axis, namely the curvature, kF , and the torsion, τF , are constant [6].

The so-called Kirchhoﬀ rod model has been proved to be a good framework to study the

statics [6, 7] and dynamics [8] of long, thin and inextensible elastic rods [9, 10]. The applica-

tions of the Kirchhoﬀ model range from Biology [1, 5, 11] to Engineering [12]. In these cases,

the rod or ﬁlament is considered as being homogeneous, but the case of nonhomogeneous

rods have been also considered in the literature. It has been shown that nonhomogeneous

Kirchhoﬀ rods may present spatial chaos [13, 14] and that helical transitions occur in the

tridimensional conﬁgurations of rods with periodic variation of the Young’s modulus [15].

A comparison between homogeneous and nonhomogeneous rods subject to given boundary

conditions and mechanical parameters was performed by da Fonseca and de Aguiar in [16].

The eﬀects of a nonhomogeneous mass distribution in the dynamics of unstable closed rods

have been analyzed by Fonseca and de Aguiar [17]. Goriely and McMillen [18] studied the

dynamics of cracking whips [19] and Kashimoto and Shiraishi [20] studied twisting waves in

inhomogeneous rods.

Here, using the Kirchhoﬀ model, we shall present the results for the equilibrium solutions

of nonhomogeneous rods with varying cross section radius and no intrinsic curvature. Only

the solutions classiﬁed by Nizette and Goriely [6] as being helical will be considered: the

straight rod, the twisted planar ring and the helix. We shall show that the twist density

varies along the rod inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the cross

section. Also, it will be seen that the curvature, kF , and the torsion, τF , are not constant

for the helix-like solutions with nonhomogeneous cross section radius.

The motivations for this work are:

i) the study of failure or rupture of cables [21, 22].

For example, it was shown that shoreline anchor rods rupture at the region where the rod

diameter diminishes due to corrosion [22]. The fact that, for twisted rods, the twist density

increases in the regions where the rod diameter decreases can be related to the onset of the

failure; ii) the shape of some climbing plants have ﬁlamentary helical structures (spring-like

tendrils) whose radius and pitch are not constant [3]. Such a tridimensional conﬁguration,

with the radius and the pitch varying along the rod, will be shown to be a possible solution

of the Kirchhoﬀ model for the nonhomogeneous rod. Other motivations are related to

defects [23], distortions [24] and the rule of twisting [25] in biological molecules.

The static Kirchhoﬀ equations, in scaled variables, for rods with circular cross section

and no intrinsic curvature are given by:

F′ = 0 ,
M′ + d3 × F = 0 ,
M = I(s) k1 d1 + I(s) k2 d2 + Γ I(s) k3 d3 ,

where s is the arc-length of the rod, the prime ′ denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to s

and the vectors F and M are the resultant force, and corresponding moment with respect to

the axis of the rod, respectively, at each cross section. di, i = 1, 2, 3, compose the director

basis with d3 chosen to be the vector tangent to the axis of the rod and d1 and d2 lie in

the plane of the cross section. ki are the components of the twist vector, k, that controls
i = k × di. k1 and

the variations of the director basis along the rod through the relation d′

k2 are related to the curvature (kF = pk2

Young’s moduli, respectively. I(s) is the variable moment of inertia that is related to the

radius of the cross section through the relation I(s) = R4(s) (valid in scaled units). Writing

the resultant force F in the director basis, F = f1d1 + f2d2 + f3d3, the equations (1) give

six diﬀerential equations for the components of the resultant force and twist vector:

f ′

− f2 k3 + f3 k2 = 0 ,

2 + f1 k3 − f3 k1 = 0 ,
f ′
− f1 k2 + f2 k1 = 0 ,

(I(s) k1)′ + (Γ − 1) I(s) k2 k3 − f2 = 0 ,

(I(s) k2)′ − (Γ − 1) I(s) k1 k3 + f1 = 0 ,

(Γ I(s) k3)′ = 0 .

(2a)

(2b)

(2c)

(2d)

(2e)

(2f)

Since I(s) = R4(s), the equation (2f) shows that the twist density k3 is inversely proportional
to R4(s). Therefore, k3 is not constant for nonhomogeneous cases. On the other hand, the

component M3 = Γ I k3 of the moment in the director basis (also called torsional moment),

is a constant along the rod.

In order to look for helical solutions of the eqs. (2) the components of the twist vector k

are expressed as follows:

k1 = kF sin ξ , k2 = kF cos ξ , k3 = ξ′ + τF ,

(3)

where kF and τF are the curvature and torsion of the rod, respectively. In the homogeneous
case kF and τF are constant, and ξ = (k3 − τF )s [6].

We shall consider the following cases: the straight rod, the twisted planar ring and the

general helix-like rod.

i) The straight rod: kF = τF = 0.

From eq. (3), k1 = k2 = 0 and from eqs. (2),

T is the tension applied to the rod. Figure 1 shows the twist density k3(s) for a straight rod

with the cross section radius varying as

k3(s) = Constant
f1 = f2 = 0 and f3 ≡ T = Constant .

Γ R4(s) ,

I(s)

R(s) = 1 + 0.1 cos(0.3s) ,

in scaled units. The mechanical parameters used to obtain the rod displayed in Figure 1

were M3 = 10−1 (scaled units) and Γ = 0.9.

ii) The twisted planar ring: kF = Constant and τF = 0.

The components of the twist vector for the twisted planar ring are:

k1 = kF sin ξ , k2 = kF cos ξ , ξ′ = k3 = M3

Γ R4(s) .

Substituting the eqs.

(6) in eqs.

(2) shows that the twisted planar ring is a possible

equilibrium solution only if the cross section radius is of the form:

R(s) = (A0 cos(kF s) + B0 sin(kF s) + CI/k2
F )

1

4 ,

where A0, B0 and CI are constants.

Remark: considering τF = 0 and assuming that kF is a function of s (instead of being a

constant) there exist no solutions for eqs. (2). So, the existence of planar solution requires

kF = Constant.

iii) The general helix-like rod: kF = kF (s) and τF = τF (s).

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

In this case, the eqs. (3) become:

k1 = kF (s) sin ξ , k2 = kF (s) cos ξ , k3 = ξ′ + τF (s) .

(8)

Substituting eq. (8) in eqs. (2), extracting f1 and f2 from eqs. (2e) and (2d), respectively,

diﬀerentiating them with respect to s and substituting in eqs. (2a) and (2b) gives a set of

diﬀerential equations for kF (s), τF (s) and f3(s):

[(I(s) kF (s))(Γ k3(s) − τF (s))]′ − (I(s) kF (s))′ τF (s) = 0 ,
(I(s) kF (s))′′ + I(s) kF (s) τF (s)(Γ k3(s) − τF (s)) − f3(s) kF (s) = 0 ,
(I(s) kF (s))′ kF (s) + f ′

3(s) = 0 .

(9)

These diﬀerential equations are nonlinear and depend on R(s) through I(s).

Figure 2 shows a helix-like rod for the following linear variation of the radius of the cross

The mechanical parameters, in scaled units, are M3 = 0.05, Γ = 0.9, kF (0) = 0.05, τF (0) =

R(s) = 1 + 0.0023 s .

(10)

In the ﬁgure 2 we display k3(s) (full line) and 0.1 R(s) (dashed line). We can see that the

2 are not constant.

Figure 3 shows the numerical solution for the curvature kF (s) (full line) and torsion

τF (s) (dashed line) for the helix-like rod shown in the ﬁgure 2. Despite the simplicity of its

tridimensional shape (ﬁgure 2, on the left) kF (s) and τF (s) are not simple functions of the

arclength s, showing the nonlinear characteristic of the system.

Figure 4 shows an example of a helix-like rod with periodic variation of the radius of the

The mechanical parameters, in scaled units, are M3 = 0.04, Γ = 0.9, kF (0) = 0.19, τF (0) =

(11)

cross section:

0.04 and f3(0) = 0.005.

The functions k3(s) and 0.1 R(s) are displayed in the ﬁgure 4 (full line and dashed line,

respectively). In this case of periodic variation of the radius of the cross section, the tridi-

mensional helix-like rod displayed in ﬁgure 4 (left) is more complicated than that displayed

in the ﬁgure 2 (left).

Figure 5 shows the numerical solution for the curvature kF (s) (full line) and torsion τF (s)

(dashed line) for the helix-like rod shown in the ﬁgure 4. The curvature and torsion are not

simple functions of the arclength s of the rod.

There is a kind of solution called free standing helix that is deﬁned by setting the resultant

force F = 0 [26]. In eqs. (9) f3(s) = 0 gives the following solution for the curvature and

torsion of the rod:

(I(s) kF (s))′ = 0 ⇒ kF (s) =
τF (s) = Γ k3(s) ⇒ τF (s) = M3

I(s) .

kF0
I(s) ,

(12)

Notice that for the free standing helix-like rod the curvature kF (s), and the torsion τF (s),

will be analytical functions of the arclength s if the moment of inertia I(s) is given by an

analytic function of s. Also

kF (s)
τF (s) is a constant for all s.

The variation of the twist density along the rod can be a key factor in a variety of

phenomena. As mentioned before, the onset of a failure in a twisted cable can be related

to the increasing of the twist density in a given region of the cable. In the Kirchhoﬀ model,

the torsional moment M3 is constant along the rod. For a relatively high value of M3 the

twist density at a region of the rod with small diameter can be so large that it may not

be valid the assumption of linear relationship between the torque and the components of

the twist vector. Also, depending on how large the moment is, the behavior of the material

could not be approximately elastic in the regions of small diameter. So, the increase of the

twist density due to the decreasing diameter in a twisted rod may be the starting point of

a process that can culminate with its rupture.

An interesting question arises for the important phenomenon known as writhing instabil-

ity. In this phenomenon a local change in the twist can lead to a global reconﬁguration of

the rod that is a consequence of a topological constraint given by a mathematical theorem

by White [27]. If the twist density varies along the rod, the question is to identify the region

of the rod where this kind of instability will occur. The nonhomogeneity considered here

can also have important consequences in the dynamics of this phenomenon [28]. It will be

a subject of a future publication.

Another implication of variable twist density along twisted rods is the problem of sta-

bility of equilibrium solutions. It is known that above a critical value of the twist density

an equilibrium solution for the Kirchhoﬀ model becomes unstable [8, 29]. Another good

question is to investigate if a local increasing of the twist density above the critical value,

can lead to a global instability of the related equilibrium solution. It could be important to

the problem of failure mentioned before.

A very hard problem in diﬀerential geometry is obtaining a direct relationship between

the curvature and the torsion with the radius and the pitch of a helix-like nonhomogeneous

rod. Since the deﬁnitions of curvature and torsion involve the calculation of the modulus

of the derivatives of tangent and normal vectors with respect to the arclength of the rod,

for non constant radius and pitch, this relation is very complicated. The analysis of this

problem will be considered in a future work.

It is interesting to note that the tridimensional conﬁguration of the ﬁgure 2 displays

a pattern in the radius and the pitch of the helix-like rod seen in the spring-like tendrils

of some climbing plants. Since the young parts of the ﬁlament that composes the plant

has smaller diameter than the older parts, these ﬁlaments are examples of rods with the

nonhomogeneity considered here.

The numerical solutions obtained for τF (s) and the solutions for k3(s) of the helix-like
cases show that the term ξ′ of the equation (3) is not null as it was proved to be for the

case of homogeneous helix [5]. It means that helix-like ﬁlaments formed by nonhomogeneous

rods are not twistless.

The existence of intrinsic curvature may lead to other planar solutions. The helix-like

solutions can also be inﬂuenced by the intrinsic curvature. This will be considered in a more

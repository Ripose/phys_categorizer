Motivated by the motion of nematode sperm cells, we present a model for the motion of an
adhesive gel on a solid substrate. The gel polymerizes at the leading edge and depolymerizes at
the rear. The motion results from a competition between a self-generated swelling gradient and
the adhesion on the substrate. The resulting stress provokes the rupture of the adhesion points
and allows for the motion. The model predicts an unusual force-velocity relation which depends in
signiﬁcant ways on the point of application of the force.

Many cells are able to crawl on a solid substrate to
which they adhere. This motion involves in general three
processes: the formation and protrusion of a thin lamel-
lipod in front of the cell, the adhesion of the lamellipod
to the substrate and its retraction at the rear, pulling
the cell forward. The formation of the lamellipod in-
volves the polymerization of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments and
their cross-linking near the membrane. Motion genera-
tion requires a symmetry breaking often associated with
the treadmilling of the cell cytoskeleton (the continuous
asymmetric polymerization at the leading extremity of
the gel and depolymerization at the rear). Typical exam-
ples for crawling cells are the motion of ﬁbroblast cells or
ﬁsh epidermal keratocytes that have been studied in de-
tails. In many cells the cytoskeleton is an actin network
and the motion generation involves a complex interaction
between actin, myosin II motors and many other proteins
[1, 2, 3].

From a point of view of physics, cell motion is closely
related to the motion of an elastic gel. Spontaneous mo-
tion of gels have been studied in several contexts. A
mechanism has been proposed where a gel rolls on a sub-
strate without slipping; the gel is not treadmilling in this
case [4]. In order to explain the motion of the bacterium
Listeria which is propelled by formation of an actin gel
comet, a description has been proposed which is based
on the interplay of gel elasticity, polymerization on the
surface of the bacteria and depolymerization at the outer
surface of the gel [5]. The coupling between polymeriza-
tion and motion is due to the stress developed between
the actin gel and the bacterium. Biomimetic experiments
on the motion of small colloidal spheres induced by an
actin comet have been performed to test these ideas [6].
More recently, Bottino et al. [7] have described the crawl-
ing of nematode sperm cells on a surface. The cytoskele-
ton is represented by a gel which is treadmilling and ad-
hering to the substrate. The polarity of the cell leads to
a pH gradient that subsequently induces a gradients in
internal tension and adhesion to the substrate which are
introduced phenomenologically.

Ascaris nematode sperm cells provide an example of

motion of a treadmilling gel in a swelling gradient. The
motility of these cells has been thoroughly studied ex-
perimentally [8, 9]. The cytoskeleton mostly consists of
an apolar protein, MSP, that similarly to actin polymer-
izes to form ﬁlaments which can be cross-linked to form
a gel [10]. The moving cell forms a thin lamellipod on
the substrate and the cell body is dragged behind the
lamellipod. There is convincing evidence that polymer-
ization of the MSP network proceeds at the advancing
edge of a motile cell [11, 12]. Depolymerization occurs in
the vicinity of the cell body. ATP is hydrolyzed in the
polymerization process but molecular motors apparently
do not play a role for motility. The local pH strongly in-
ﬂuences the polymerization and depolymerization of the
MSP network[13]: an increase of pH enhances the poly-
merization and a decrease of pH provokes depolymeriza-
tion of the network. It has been proposed that an inﬂux
of protons in the cell body creates a pH source which
leads to a pH gradient and thus an asymmetry between
the front and the rear of the cell[14].

The aim of the present letter is to describe on very
general physical grounds the motion of an isotropic elas-
tic gel adhering on a surface by considering the interplay
between a self-generated concentration ﬁeld (pH) that
creates a gradient in the gel properties and the adhesion.
In order to illustrate the main principles of motion of an
adhesive gel in a swelling gradient, we use simpliﬁed as-
sumptions. We assume that the main eﬀect of the pH
is to change the local equilibrium swelling of the gel and
that the advancing gel is more contracted at the rear (our
mechanism is however more general and does not depend
on the sign of the gradient); we furthermore assume that
the gel adheres to the substrate by localized adhesion
points and that the adhesion is strongly irreversible. This
implies that the adhesion points are broken if they are
subject to a constraint that exceeds a threshold. Using
general elasticity theory, we show that the combination
of adhesion and an equilibrium swelling gradient gener-
ates stresses in the gel that become large at the rear part
and provoke a rupture of the adhesion points. For the
sake of simplicity, we use a two-dimensional model, that

Consider a thin treadmilling gel in a concentration gra-
dient (pH). The situation sketched in ﬁgure (1) involves
a gel of small thickness h that adheres on the substrate
over a length L ≫ h. Behind the adhering part, there is
a non adhering part of the gel of length L′. The pH gra-
dient is stationary in the reference frame of the moving
gel. The gel forms at the leading edge by polymeriza-
tion and it depolymerizes at the rear. In the following,
we use the state of the gel formed by polymerization as
the reference state for the quantiﬁcation of elastic defor-
mations: in this state, two points connected by a vector
dx are at a distance ds2
0 = δijdxidxj . As the polymer-
ization proceeds, each point of the gel is transported by
the treadmilling process inside the moving gel and dis-
placed by a vector u with respect to the substrate. The
gel undergoes elastic deformations resulting in changes
in the distance between the two points which becomes
ds2 = gijdxidxj where gij = δij + 2ǫij is the metric ten-
sor and ǫij = 1

given volume element is transported toward low pH re-
gions as time goes on; its equilibrium swelling changes
and it tends to contract. We assume here for simplicity
that the equilibrium state of the gel at a given position (a
given pH) is isotropic. Swelling of the gel implies that the
distance between two neighboring points in the equilib-
rium state is contracted by a factor Λ that depends only
on the local pH, as compared to the reference state in
which it was formed. The contraction factor Λ increases
from a value Λ < 1 at the rear of the gel to Λ = 1 at
the leading edge. The equilibrium state of the gel is the
state that a small gel element would reach if it were cut
from the rest of the gel while remaining in its environ-
ment. The metric tensor in the local equilibrium state is
ij = Λ2δij. The strain tensor is deﬁned in a standard

way as uij = 1
2 δij + ǫij . The stress
tensor in the gel σij can be calculated by assuming again
that the gel is isotropic and by introducing the two Lam´e
coeﬃcients λ and µ such that σij = λukkδij + 2µuij. The
two Lam´e coeﬃcients may themselves depend on the local

pH but, within a linear elasticity description, we ignore
here this variation. Our model for the motion is one-
dimensional, x is the coordinate parallel to the substrate
and z is perpendicular. The stress tensor can then be
written as σij = (λ + µ)(1 − Λ2)δij + λǫkkδij + 2µǫij. The
second and third terms in this expression are the stan-
dard contributions from linear elasticity theory; the ﬁrst
term, related to the change in equilibrium swelling, plays
the role of the tensile stress introduced phenomenologi-
cally by Bottino et al. [7].

Locally the gel is at mechanical equilibrium and the di-

ever, the gel does not relax to its equilibrium swelling
since it adheres on the surface. If we assume that the ad-
hesion occurs at the leading edge upon the formation of
the gel and that the adhesion points are frozen, the dis-
placement u vanishes at each point on the surface. The
upper surface of the gel is free and the two components
of the stress vanish there σiz(h) = 0.

The elastic deformation is calculated by solving the
force balance equation.
Inside the gel, we use a lubri-
cation approximation [17]: the variation of the displace-
ment occurs over a distance h in the perpendicular direc-
tion (z) much smaller than the distance L in the direction
parallel to the substrate and the derivatives with respect
to z are thus much larger than the derivatives with re-
spect to x. We ﬁnd [18]

The deformation in the x direction at the free surface
(z = h) is negative towards the rear where the gel con-
traction is stronger. The “lubrication approximation” is
valid everywhere in the gel except in a region of size h
both at the leading edge and at the rear of the gel. The
distance to the edge of the gel is smaller than h in these
regions and the full elasticity equations must be solved.
At the rear, the gel tends to contract and the deforma-
tion in the x direction becomes positive. The tangential
stress on the substrate (z = 0) at position x reads

The stress on the surface is negative as the gel is pulled
towards the rear part. The tangential stress on the sur-
face is balanced by the force per unit area exerted by the
adhesion points. If there is a uniform density ρs of adhe-
sion points, the (positive) force exerted by each point on
the gel is f = −σxz/ρs.

So far, we have considered a ﬂat piece of gel of length L
adhering on the substrate. At the rear of this piece over
a region with a size of the order of the thickness h, the
signs of both the deformation and the tangential stress
change. A precise calculation of the tangential stress in

this region is diﬃcult as it requires a complete solution
of the elasticity equations. However, one can get an esti-
mate of the stress using the macroscopic force balance on
the adhering gel along the substrate. The total force act-
ing on the gel vanishes. Since there are no external forces
acting at the upper surface and at the leading edge, the

consistent

The adhesion points on the substrate have a ﬁnite
strength, they rupture if the force exerted by the gel is
too large. We consider here that adhesion is irreversible
and that there is a threshold for the rupture of an ad-
hesion point (that can be associated to several molecu-
lar bonds). The rupture of each adhesion point can be
viewed as the escape of a particle from an attractive po-
tential well under the action of an external force (the gel
stress). This problem has been studied in details by sev-
eral authors [19, 20]; we use here the simpliﬁed approach
that ignores thermal ﬂuctuations which amounts to char-
acterize each adhesion point by the critical force fc that
it can sustain (This force could also in principle depend
on pH and on the time scale of the adhesion breakage
[20]). The stress exerted on the substrate by the gel be-
ing largest at the back of the adhering gel, the adhesion
points ﬁrst break at the back of the gel. The critical ad-
hesion force, using equation (3), deﬁnes a critical value
of the tangential stress and thus a critical value of the
swelling ratio Λc at which adhesion bonds rupture. If we
assume steady state motion, the pH proﬁle and thus also
the proﬁle of swelling Λ(x) are stationary in the reference
frame of the gel. The critical adhesion force then imposes
the distance L′ between the rear of the gel and the point
where the adhesion points rupture when Λ(0) = Λc. An
important point is that our model does not require any
adhesion gradient, the adhesion rupture occurs at the
point of strongest tension.

We therefore obtain the picture sketched in ﬁg. (1) of
a gel adhering to the substrate in the front part over a
length L but not adhering in the rear over a length L′.
The adhering gel is under stress while the non-adhering
gel can relax to its local equilibrium swelling character-
ized by Λ(x). The picture is not changed qualitatively if
the critical force of the adhesion points fc depends on pH,
only the precise value of L′ changes. The concept of rup-
ture of discrete adhesion points implies that the motion is
not steady but occurs in jumps. As the depolymerization

3

(and the polymerization) proceeds, the force on the most
strongly loaded adhesion point increases further until the
critical value is reached which provokes rupture. When
an adhesion point ruptures, the gel relaxes rapidly and
moves in the direction of motion. We implicitly assume
here that the rupture is irreversible: adhesion points do
not reform immediately and the kinetics of formation of
the adhesion points is slow compared to the depolymer-
ization kinetics.

The model is consistent if the internal stress is large
enough to induce rupture of the adhesion points (L′ must
be positive) and if the adhesion points can form (L must
be larger than h) otherwise the gel gets stuck on the
substrate. Our simpliﬁed description relies on the use
a two-dimensional model. For a real three-dimensional
gel, collective eﬀects such as detachment waves similar
to those observed in friction problems could be expected
[21]. This will be the subject of future studies.

The gel adhering on a surface advances by polymer-
ization at the leading edge and depolymerization at the
rear. The motion is possible because of the rupture of the
adhesion points that we just discussed. The polymeriza-
tion reactions are far from equilibrium and we assume for
simplicity that only polymerization occurs at the leading
edge and only depolymerization occurs at the rear. The
free energy gain in these reactions (as well as the energy
required to maintain the pH gradient) are the sources of
energy for the motion. The dissipation is mainly due to
the gel retraction after the rupture of adhesion points.

In order to obtain a complete model for motion, we
have to characterize the polymerization and depolymer-
ization reactions. We denote the local concentration of
free monomers by ρ(x), the local gel concentration by
c(x) = c0 Λ(x)−2, where c0 is the concentration at the
leading edge of the gel. The total number of monomers in
the gel, mgel, increases by polymerization and decreases
by depolymerization. The kinetics of these reactions is
written as

Here, the subscripts l and r refer, respectively, to the

tion kd should be taken at the local pH (at the leading

The main result of this letter is to show that a gel can
sustain a steady state motion via a treadmilling mecha-
nism even though it adheres to the substrate. No gra-
dient in adhesive strength is required for this to hap-
pen. The two necessary ingredients are the existence of
a critical rupture force for the adhesive bonds and of
a self-sustained gradient leading to a change in the gel
swelling. The critical rupture force depends on the load-
ing rate, the actual value must therefore be determined
taking the gel speed into account. Furthermore, the ex-
istence of the mechanism does not depend on the sign
of the induced gel swelling. The gradient that controls
swelling has been described in terms of a pH gradient,
but any other gradient in the gel could play this role.
The diﬀerential swelling of the gel could also result from
the action of molecular motors as will be discussed in a
forthcoming publication. We have presented a generic
mechanism. Its originality and robustness stem from the
peculiar distribution of the stresses at the gel-substrate
interface. Over most of the gel surface, the stress pulling
on the adhesive bonds is proportional to the gel thickness
and the swelling gradient. In a small region where the
rupture occurs, conventional elasticity tells us that it is
of opposite sign and larger by a factor L/h. For nema-
todes, L/h is of order 10 − 20 and there is a broad range
of adhesive strength over which the mechanism can work.
This stress distribution can be measured using techniques
recently developed to study the forces that cells develop
on soft substrates[22]. A sign inversion of the stress as
proposed here has been observed on keratocyte cells [23].
It is very instructive to study within our framework
the situation where external forces act on the moving gel.
The eﬀect of a force has a striking signature depending
on the position where the force is applied. Consider an
external force applied at position x along the substrate.
If the force is acting at a point inside the adhering gel, the
elasticity equations show that its eﬀect is screened: the
gel deformation and the stress on the surface are changed
only over a region of size h (the gel thickness) around the
point of application; the force therefore has no eﬀect on
the gel velocity, total length and adhering length until
it reaches a bond rupture value. If the force is applied
at the front of the gel, its eﬀect is also localized. The
force however tends to reduce the polymerization rate;
the behavior of the gel in a steady state strongly de-
pends on the depolymerization conditions at the rear of
the gel. If the force is applied at the rupture point, it
must be added to the macroscopic force balance in the

4

gel which determines the stress at the rupture point. In
the presence of an additional force, the adhering section
of the gel is increased and corresponds to an eﬀective
rupture force fc + f /(ρch). Eventually, a force applied
at the rear of the gel and opposing the motion inﬂuences
the depolymerization. In general it increases the depoly-
merization rate and according to equation 4 the velocity
increases. The gel in this case has a negative mobility!
All these surprising predictions could be tested experi-
mentally. We will present a more detailed study of the
eﬀect of a force in a future publication.

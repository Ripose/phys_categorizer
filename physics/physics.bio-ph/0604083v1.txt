In this article, we propose a susceptible-infected network model with identical infectivity, in which,
at every time step, each node can only contact a constant number of neighbors. We implemented
this model on scale-free networks, and found that the infected population grows in an exponential
form with the time scale proportional to the spreading rate.
In addition, we investigated a fast
spreading strategy when only local information is available. Diﬀerent from the extensively studied
path ﬁnding strategy, the strategy preferring small nodes is more eﬃcient than that preferring large
nodes. Interestingly, our results indicate the existence of an essential relationship between network
traﬃc and network epidemic on scale-free networks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Since the seminal works on the small-world phe-
nomenon by Watts and Strogatz [1] and scale-free prop-
erty by Barab´asi and Albert [2], the studies of com-
plex networks have attracted a lot of interests within
the physics community [3, 4]. One of the ultimate goals
of the current studies on complex networks is to un-
derstand and explain the workings of the systems built
upon them [5, 6]. The previous works about epidemic
spreading in scale-free networks present us with com-
pletely new epidemic propagation scenarios that a highly
heterogeneous structure will lead to the absence of any
epidemic threshold (see the review papers [7, 8] and
the references therein). These works mainly concen-
trate on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) [9, 10]
and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) [11, 12] models.
However, many real epidemic processes can not be prop-
erly described by the above two models. For example, in
many technological communication networks, each node
not only acts as a communication source and sink, but
also forwards information to others [13, 14]. In the pro-
cess of broadcasting [15, 16], each node can be in two dis-
crete states, either received or unreceived. A node in the
received state has received information and can forward
it to others like the infected individual in the epidemic
process, while a node in the unreceived state is similar
to the susceptible one. Since the node in the received
state generally will not lose information, the so-called
susceptible-infected (SI) model is more suitable for de-
scribing the above dynamical process. Another typical
situation where the SI model is more appropriate than
SIS and SIR models is the investigation of the dynamical
behaviors in the very early stage of epidemic outbreaks
when the eﬀects of recovery and death can be ignored.
The behaviors of the SI model are not only of theoreti-
cal interest, but also of practical signiﬁcance beyond the

physics community. However, this has not been carefully
investigated thus far.

Very recently, Barth´elemy et al.

[17, 18] studied the
SI model in Barab´asi-Albert (BA) scale-free networks
[2], and found that the density of infected nodes, de-
noted by i(t), grows approximately in the exponential
form, i(t) ∼ ect, where the time scale c is proportional
to the ratio between the second and the ﬁrst moments
of the degree distribution, c ∼ hk2i/hki . Since the
degree distribution of the BA model obeys the power-
law form P (k) ∼ k−γ with γ = 3, this epidemic pro-
cess has an inﬁnite spreading velocity in the limit of in-
ﬁnite population. Following a similar process on ran-
dom Apollonian networks [19, 20, 21] and the Barrat-
Barth´elemy-Vespignani networks [22, 23], Zhou et al. in-
vestigated the eﬀects of clustering [19] and weight dis-
tribution [24] on SI epidemics. And by using the theory
of branching processes, Vazquez obtained a more accu-
rate solution of i(t), including the behaviors with large
t [25]. The common assumption in all the aforemen-
tioned works [17, 18, 19, 24] is that each node’s potential
infection-activity (infectivity), measured by its possibly
maximal contribution to the propagation process within
one time step, is strictly equal to its degree [26]. The node
with very large degree is called a hub in network science
[3, 4, 5, 6], while the node with great infectivity in an
epidemic contact network is named superspreader in the
epidemiological literature [27, 28]. All the previous stud-
ies on SI network model have a basic assumption, that is,
hub ≡ superspreader. This assumption is valid in some
cases where the hub node is much more powerful than
the others. However, there are still many real spreading
processes, which can not be properly described by this
assumption. Some typical examples are as follows.

• In the broadcasting process, the forwarding capacity
of each node is limited. Especially, in wireless multihop
ad hoc networks, each node usually has the same power

thus almost the same forwarding capacity [29].

• In epidemic contact networks, the hub node has many
acquaintances; however, he/she could not contact all
his/her acquaintances within one time step. Analogously,
although a few individuals have hundreds of sexual part-
ners, their sexual activities are not far beyond a normal
level due to the physiological limitations [30, 31, 32].

• In some email service systems, such as the Gmail sys-
tem schemed out by Google [33], one can be a client only
if he/she received at least one invitation from some ex-
isting clients. And after he/she becomes a client, he/she
will have the ability to invite others. However, the max-
imal number of invitations he/she can send per a certain
period of time is limited.

• In network marketing processes, the referral of a
product to potential consumers costs money and time
(e.g. a salesman has to make phone calls to persuade his
social surrounding to buy the product). Thus, generally
speaking, the salesman will not make referrals to all his
acquaintances [34].

In addition, since the infectivity of each node is as-
signed to be equal to its degree, one cannot be sure which
(the power-law degree distribution, the power-law infec-
tivity distribution, or both) is the main reason that leads
to the virtually inﬁnite propagation velocity of the infec-
tion.

II. MODEL

Diﬀerent from the previous works, here we investigate
the SI process on scale-free networks with identical infec-
tivity. In our model, individuals can be in two discrete
states, either susceptible or infected. The total popula-

normal (a) and single-log (b) plots. The black, red, green
and blue curves correspond to λ = 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08,
respectively. In single-log plot (b), the early behavior of i(t)
can be well ﬁtted by a straight line, indicating the exponen-
tial growth of infected population. The inset shows the ﬁtting
slope vs spreading rate λ. The numerical simulations are im-
plemented based on a BA network of size N = 5000 and with
average degree hki = 6, and the data are averaged over 5000
independent runs.

tion (i.e. the network size) N is assumed to be constant;
thus, if S(t) and I(t) are the numbers of susceptible and
infected individuals at time t, respectively, then

N = S(t) + I(t).

(1)

Denote by λ the spreading rate at which each susceptible
individual acquires infection from an infected neighbor
during one time step. Accordingly, one can easily obtain
the probability that a susceptible individual x will be
infected at time step t to be

λx(t) = 1 − (1 − λ)θ(x,t−1),

(2)

where θ(x, t − 1) denotes the number of contacts between
x and the infected individuals at time t − 1. For small λ,

3

 

one has

λx(t) ≈ λθ(x, t − 1).

(3)

 

Extensional BA networks

In the standard SI network model [17, 18, 19], each
infected individual will contact all its neighbors once at
each time step, thus the infectivity of each node is de-
ﬁned by its degree and θ(x, t) is equal to the number of
its infected neighbors at time t. In the present model,
we assume every individual has the same infectivity A,
in which, at every time step, each infected individual will
generate A contacts where A is a constant. Multiple con-
tacts to one neighbor are allowed, and contacts between
two infected ones, although having no eﬀect on the epi-
demic dynamics, are also counted just like the standard
SI model. The dynamical process starts by selecting one
node randomly, assuming it is infected.

III. SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS

In the standard SI network model, the average infectiv-
ity equals the average degree hki. Therefore, in order to
compare the proposed model with the standard one, we
set A = hki. As shown in Fig. 1, the dynamical behav-
iors of the present model and the standard one are clearly
diﬀerent: The velocity of the present model is much less
than that of the standard model.

In the following discussions, we focus on the proposed
model. Without loss of generality, we set A = 1. Denote
by ik(t) the density of infected k-degree nodes. Based on
the mean-ﬁeld approximation, one has

dik(t)
dt

= λk[1 − ik(t)] X
k′

1
k′

k′P (k′)ik′ (t)
Pk′′ k′′P (k′′)

,

(4)

where P (k) denotes the probability that a randomly se-
lected node has degree k. The factor 1
k′ accounts for the
probability that one of the infected neighbors of a node,
with degree k′, will contact this node at the present time
step. Note that the infected density is given by

i(t) = X
k

ik(t)P (k),

(5)

so Eq. (4) can be rewritten as

dik(t)
dt

λk
hki

=

[1 − ik(t)]i(t).

(6)

Manipulating the operator Pk P (k) on both sides, and
neglecting terms of order O(i2), one obtains the evolution
behavior of i(t) as follows:

i(t) ∼ ect,

(7)

where c ∝ λ is a constant independent of the network
structure.

γ = 2.0, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8 and 3.0, respectively. The numerical sim-
ulations are implemented based on the extensional BA net-
work of size N = 1000 and with average degree hki = 6, and
the data are averaged over 10000 independent runs.

i(t) vs t can be well ﬁtted by a straight line in single-
log plot for small t with slope proportional to λ, which
strongly supports the analytical results. Furthermore,
based on the extended BA model [35, 36], we investigated
the eﬀect of network structure on epidemic behaviors.
Diﬀerent from the standard SI network model [17, 18],
which is highly aﬀected by the power-law exponent γ, as
shown in Fig. 3, the exponent γ here has almost no ef-
fects on the epidemic behaviors of the present model. In
other words, in the present model, the spreading rate λ,
rather than the network structure, governs the epidemic
behaviors.

IV. FAST SPREADING STRATEGY

Many previous studies about network epidemic pro-
cesses focus on how to control the epidemic spreading,
especially for scale-free networks [37, 38, 39]. Contrarily,
few studies aim at accelerating the epidemic spreading
process. However, a fast spreading strategy may be very
useful for enhancing the eﬃciency of network broadcast-
ing or for making proﬁts from network marketing.
In
this section, we give a primary discussion on this issue
by introducing and investigating a simple fast spreading
strategy. Since the whole knowledge of network struc-
ture may be unavailable for large-scale networks, here we
assume only local information is available.

In our strategy, at every time step, each infected node
x will contact its neighbor y (in the broadcasting process,
it means to forward a message to node y) at a probabil-
ity proportional to kβ
y , where ky denotes the degree of

ferent β. In Figure 4(a), the black, blue, pink, red and green
curves correspond to β = 0, −1, −2, 1 and 2, respectively. In
Figure 4(b), the black, red, blue, green, pink and ochreous
curves correspond to β = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5, respec-
tively. In Figure 4(c), the black, red, blue, green, pink and
ochreous curves correspond to β = 0, −0.1, −0.2, −0.3, −0.4
and −0.5, respectively. The numerical simulations are imple-
mented based on the extensional BA network of size N = 5000
and with average degree hki = 6, and the data are averaged
over 5000 independent runs.

FIG. 5: (Color online) Tη vs β for diﬀerent η. The black
squares, red circles, blue up-triangles, green down-triangles,
and pink left-triangles denote the cases of η = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7
and 0.9, respectively. The data points labelled by hollow black
circles correspond to the minimal Tη, that is, the optimal β.
For η = 0.5, the values at β = −0.1 and β = −0.2 are the
same. All the data are obtained from the same i(t) curves as
shown in Figures 4(b) and 4(c).

y. There are two ingredients simultaneously aﬀect the
performance of the present strategy. On the one hand,
the strategy preferring large node (i.e. the strategy with
β > 0) corresponds to shorter average distance in the
path searching algorithm [40, 41], thus it may lead to
faster spreading. On the other hand, to contact an al-
ready infected node (i.e. to forward a message to a node
having already received this message) has no eﬀects on
the spreading process, and the nodes with larger degrees
are more easily to be infected according to Eq. (6) in the
case of β = 0. Therefore, the strategy with β > 0 will
bring many redundant contacts that may slow down the
spreading. For simplicity, we call the former the shorter
path eﬀect (SPE), and the latter the redundant contact
eﬀect (RCE).

Figure 4(a) shows the density of infected individuals
i(t) as a function of t for diﬀerent β. Clearly, due to the
competition between the two ingredients, SPE and RCE,
the strategies with too large (e.g. β = 1, 2) or too small
(e.g. β = −1, −2) β are ineﬃcient comparing with the
unbiased one with β = 0. The cases when β is around
zero are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). In Fig. 4(b), one
can see that the RCE plays the major role in determining
the epidemic velocity when β > 0; that is, larger β leads
to slower spreading. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the condition
is much more complex when β < 0: In the early stage,
the unbiased strategy seems better; however, as time goes
on, it is exceeded by the others.

To provide a clear picture of the cases with negative β,
we introduce a time measure Tη, which denotes the time
when the density of infected individuals ﬁrstly exceed
η. The value of η depends on practical requirements: If

one cares about the early stage of information spreading,
he/she should consider small η. On the contrary, the η
closer to one is better if one cares about how long it takes
to broadcast a message to the whole network. Figure 5
exhibits the curves Tη(β) for diﬀerent η. When i(t) gets
larger, the RCE becomes more and more important; thus,
the smaller β becomes ascendent. So, the optimal value
of β with larger η is smaller than that with smaller η.

In other words, the RCE plays the major role in deter-
mining the epidemic velocity, so that the strategies with
negative β perform better than the positive ones. Fur-
thermore, for diﬀerent η, the optimal β corresponding to
the smallest Tη are diﬀerent.

V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

Almost all the previous studies about the SI model
in scale-free networks essentially assume that the nodes
of large degrees are not only dominant in topology, but
also the superspreaders. However, not all the SI network
processes can be appropriately described under this as-
sumption. Typical examples include the network broad-
casting process with a limited forwarding capacity, the
epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases where all in-
dividuals’ sexual activities are pretty much the same due
to the physiological limitations, the email service sys-
tems with limited ability to accept new clients, the net-
work marketing systems where the referral of products
to potential consumers costs money and time, and so on.
Inspired by these practical requirements, in this article
we have studied the behaviors of susceptible-infected epi-
demics on scale-free networks with identical infectivity.
The infected population grows in an exponential form in
the early stage. However, diﬀerent from the standard SI
network model, the epidemic behavior is not sensitive to
the power-law exponent γ, but is governed only by the
spreading rate λ. Both the simulation and analytical re-
sults indicate that it is the heterogeneity of infectivities,
rather than the heterogeneity of degrees, governs the epi-
demic behaviors.

We have also investigated a fast spreading strategy

5

when only local information is available. Diﬀerent from
previous reports about some relative processes taking
place on scale-free networks [40, 41], we found that the
strategy preferring small nodes is more eﬃcient than
those preferring large nodes. This result indicates that
the redundant contact eﬀect is more important than the
shorter path eﬀect. This ﬁnding may be useful in prac-
tice. Very recently, some authors suggested using a quan-
tity named “saturation time” to estimate the epidemic ef-
ﬁciency [42, 43]. This quantity is just the same as T0.9 in
this article. Accordingly, one may conclude that the opti-
mal value corresponding to the fast spreading is β = −0.3
(see Fig. 5).

The analytical approach proposed by Barth´elemy et al.
[17, 18] does not work if the RCE is taken into account
[44]; thus, we can not provide a theoretical explanation
for the optimal value of β with a given η. The theory
of branching processes [45] provides us a possible way to
better understand the epidemic behaviors of the present
model. This will be our future work.

Some recent studies on network traﬃc dynamics show
that the networks will have larger throughput if using
routing strategies preferring small nodes [46, 47, 48]. It
is because this strategy can avoid possible congestion oc-
curring at large-degree nodes. Although the quantitative
results are far diﬀerent, there may exist some common
features between network traﬃc and network epidemic.
We believe that our work can further enlighten the read-
ers on this interesting subject.

[26] Actually, only the contacts between susceptible and in-
fected nodes have possible contributions in epidemic pro-
cesses. However, since in a real epidemic process, an in-
fected node usually does not know whether its neigh-
bors are infected, the standard network SI model assumes
that each infected node will contact every neighbor once
within one time step [17], thus the infectivity is equal to
the node degree.

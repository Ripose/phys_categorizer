Relaxation channels of two-vibron bound states in α-helix proteins

Relaxation channels for two-vibron bound states in an anharmonic α-helix protein are studied.
According to a recently established small polaron model [V. Pouthier, Phys. Rev. E68, 021909
(2003)],
it is pointed out that the relaxation originates in the interaction between the dressed
anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons. This interaction is responsible for the occurrence
of transitions between two-vibron eigenstates mediated by both phonon absorption and phonon
emission. At biological temperature, it is shown that the relaxation rate does not signiﬁcantly
depends on the nature of the two-vibron state involved in the process. Therefore, the lifetime for
both bound and free states is of the same order of magnitude and ranges between 0.1 and 1.0 ps
for realistic parameters. By contrast, the relaxation channels strongly depend on the nature of
the two-vibron states which is a consequence of the breather-like behavior of the two-vibron bound
states.

INTRODUCTION

Since the pioneer works of Davydov and co-workers [1],
soliton mechanisms for bioenergy transport in proteins
have received increasing attention during the last twenty
ﬁve years [2, 3]. The main idea is that the energy released
by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be
stored in the C=O vibration (amide-I) of a peptide group.
The dipole-dipole coupling between peptide groups leads
to the delocalization of these vibrations and to the forma-
tion of vibrational excitons, i.e. vibrons. Therefore, the
strong interaction between the vibrons and the phonons
of the protein yields a nonlinear dynamics which favors
the occurrence of the so called Davydov’s soliton.

However, it has been pointed out that the solution of
the Davydov’s problem is rather a small vibron-polaron
than a vibron-soliton [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Indeed, the vibron
bandwidth in proteins is smaller than the phonon cut-
oﬀ frequency so that the non-adiabatic limit is reached.
During its propagation, a vibron is dressed by a virtual
cloud of phonons which yields a lattice distortion essen-
tially located on a single site and which follows instan-
taneously the vibron (small polaron). Nevertheless, the
dressing eﬀect leads to an attractive interaction between
vibrons mediated by virtual phonons. Such an interac-
tion is responsible for the formation of bound states and
it has been suggested that proteins can support solitons
formed by bound states involving a large number of vi-
brational quanta [7, 8, 9].

Although this formalism gives a comprehensive schema
for the formation of solitons in proteins, it assumes the
harmonic approximation for the amide-I vibration. How-
ever, this approximation failed when several vibrons are
excited because the intramolecular anharmonicity acts

∗Electronic address: vincent.pouthier@univ-comte.fr

as an additional nonlinear source. As the dressing ef-
fect, the anharmonicity is responsible for the formation
of bound states [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and the funda-
mental question of the interplay between both sources of
nonlinearity has been addressed in a recent paper [16]. In
this work, we have restricted our attention to the forma-
tion of two-vibron bound states (TVBS’s), only. Indeed,
although the inﬂuence of the anharmonicity in molec-
ular lattices have been the subject of intense research
during the last decade, this research was essentially re-
stricted to classical lattices (for a recent review see for
instance Refs. [17, 18, 19]). In particular, the formation
of discrete breathers, i.e. highly localized nonlinear vi-
brations, has been demonstrated. However, in spite of
the great interest that these classical nonlinear objects
have attracted, no clear evidence has been found for their
existence in real lattices. By contrast, TVBS are have
been observed in several low-dimensional molecular lat-
tices [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. These quantum
objects correspond to the ﬁrst quantum states which ex-
perience the nonlinearity and can thus be viewed as the
quantum counterpart of breathers or soliton excitations
[12]. Their characterization is thus essential and appears
as a ﬁrst step to understand the formation of multi-vibron
solitons.

In Ref.[16], we have shown that the anharmonicity
modiﬁes the vibron-phonon interaction which results in
an enhancement of the dressing eﬀect. Anharmonic vi-
brons are thus more sensitive to the dressing than har-
monic vibrons. Moreover, both nonlinear sources favor
the occurrence of two kinds of bound states which the
properties strongly depend on the anharmonicity.
In
the harmonic situation, the two bound states appear as
combinations of states involving the trapping of the two
vibrons onto the same amide-I mode and onto nearest
neighbor amide-I modes. By contrast, the intramolecular
anharmonicity reduces the hybridization between these
two kinds of trapping so that the low frequency bound

state refers to the trapping of the two vibrons onto the
same amide-I mode whereas the high frequency bound
state characterizes the trapping onto nearest neighbor
amide-I vibrations.

In this study, the dynamical coupling between the
dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons
was disregarded. Therefore, the present paper is devoted
to the characterization of this coupling and to a detailed
analysis of the relaxation pathways. The TVBS lifetime
is determined with a special emphasis on the inﬂuence of
the diﬀerent nonlinear sources.

At biological temperature, the lifetime of the Davy-
dov’s soliton is still an open question. It has been shown
that the amide-I excitation, in vivo, corresponds to a lo-
calized state [29, 30]. Instead of traveling in a coherent
manner, it follows a stochastic, diﬀusional path along the
lattice. In other words, the single-vibron Davydov soliton
does not last long enough to be useful at biological tem-
peratures and it has been shown that two-vibron solitons
are more stable and appear as good candidates for bioen-
ergy transport [31, 32]. However, recent calculations per-
formed by Ivic et al.
[9] clearly show that the multi-
vibron soliton lifetime is of about a few picoseconds, i.e.
the same order of magnitude as the single-vibron soliton
lifetime found by Cottingham and Schweitzer [33, 34].

In Sec.

The paper is organized as follows.

dressed anharmonic vibron point of view described in de-
tails in Ref. [16] is ﬁrst summarized. Then, the coupling
Hamiltonian between these anharmonic polarons and the
remaining phonons is determined. The TVBS relaxation
rate is expressed in Sec. III and studied numerically in
Sec. IV. The results are ﬁnally discussed in Sec. V.

A. The general vibron-phonon Hamiltonian

According to the original Davydov’s model, the collec-
tive dynamics of the amide-I vibrations is described by a
one-dimensional lattice with N sites containing the C=O
vibrations. The nth amide-I mode is assumed to behave
as a high frequency anharmonic oscillator described by
the standard operators b+
n and bn. This oscillator is char-
acterized by its harmonic frequency ω0 and by the cubic
and quartic anharmonic parameters γ3 and γ4, respec-
tively. Finally, the dipole-dipole coupling between near-
est neighbor amide-I modes is described by the constant
J. These C=O vibrations interact with the phonons of
the lattice which characterize the dynamics of the exter-
nal motions of the peptide groups. Within the harmonic
approximation, the phonons correspond to a set of N low
frequency acoustic modes labeled
and described by
the phonon operators a+

The Hamiltonian Eq.(1) describes the dynamics of an-
harmonic vibrons dressed by virtual phonons, i.e. an-
harmonic small polarons. It takes into account on the
intramolecular anharmonicity up to the second order
and allows for a renormalization of the main part of
the vibron-phonon coupling. However, this coupling re-
mains through the dressing operators Θn(Nn) which de-
pend on the phonon coordinates in a highly nonlinear
way. Therefore, to separate the vibron degrees of free-
dom from the phonon coordinates, a mean ﬁeld proce-
dure is applied. The full Hamiltonian ˆH is thus writ-
ten as ˆH = ˆHef f + Hp + ∆H, where Hp is the phonon
Hamiltonian and where ˆHef f =< ˆH >

where the total momentum k is associated to the mo-
tion of the center of mass of the two vibrons whereas
the resulting wave function Ψk(m) refers to the degree
of freedom m which characterizes the distance between
the two vibrons. Since k is a good quantum number,
the Hamiltonian ˆHef f appears as block diagonal and the
Schrodinger equation can be solved for each k value. For
a given k value, the protein exhibits (N +1)/2 eigenstates
, where the index σ = 1, ..., (N + 1)/2 refers to the

position of the states along the energy axis. Due to the
nonlinear sources, there are two diﬀerent eigenstates, i.e.
the two-vibron free states (TVFS) and the TVBS. The
TVFS correspond to a delocalization of the separating
distance m between the two vibrons. The wave function
Ψk(m) behaves as a plane wave and the TVFS belong to
an energy continuum. By contrast, TVBS correspond to
a localization of the separating distance between the two
vibrons and characterize the trapping of the two quanta
over only a few neighboring sites. We have shown that
the protein supports two kinds of bound states, called
TVBS-I and TVBS-II, respectively. The TVBS-I, de-
noted
, are located below the TVFS continuum
over the entire Brillouin zone whereas for TVBS-II, two

polaron binding energy. For small values of EB, the band

a critical wave vector kc whereas, for strong values of EB,
the band is located below the continuum over the entire
Brillouin zone. As a result, the notation
refers
either to a free state or to TVBS-II, depending on the
situation. In the harmonic situation, both TVBS-I and
TVBS-II appear as combinations of states involving the
trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide-I mode
and onto nearest neighbor amide-I modes. By contrast,
the intramolecular anharmonicity reduces the hybridiza-
tion between these two kinds of trapping so that TVBS-I
refers to the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same
amide-I mode whereas TVBS-II characterizes the trap-
ping onto nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations.

C. The vibron-phonon coupling Hamiltonian

By comparing Eq.(1) and Eq.(5), it is straightforward
to show that the coupling Hamiltonian ∆H corresponds
to a modulation of the diﬀerent lateral contributions de-
scribing vibron hops, i.e. the terms proportional to J1,
J2 and J3 in Eq.(1). However, in α-helix proteins, it has
J1/ω0 [16]. As a result J2
been shown that J2 ≈
and J3 are of about three orders of magnitude lesser than
J1 and can be neglected. The coupling Hamiltonian ∆H
is thus written as

In addition, the small polaron binding energy is of about
one order of magnitude smaller than the phonon cutoﬀ
frequency so that the dressing operator Eq.(3) can be lin-
earized [8, 9]. As a consequence, by neglecting the rather
small parameter η in Eq.(3) [16], the coupling between
the anharmonic polarons and the remaining phonons is
ﬁnally expressed as

Therefore, within the anharmonic polaron point of view,
the main contribution of the coupling with the remain-
ing phonons corresponds to a random modulation of the
single-vibron hopping constant. As shown in the follow-
ing sections, this coupling is responsible for the relaxation
of the two-vibron eigenstates.

III. TWO-VIBRON BOUND STATE
RELAXATION RATE

Due to the coupling Hamiltonian ∆H (Eq.(9)), TVBS
do not represent exact eigenstates of the whole polaron-
phonon system. More precisely, this coupling is responsi-
ble for the occurrence of transitions between two-vibron
states mediated by the emission or the absorption of
acoustic phonons. Therefore, by using the Golden rule
formula, the rate for the transition from a TVBS

the total rate for leaving the state

phonon Hamiltonian Hp.

As shown in Eq.(12), the TVBS relaxation rate is ex-
pressed in terms of the Fourier transform of the corre-
lation function of the coupling ∆J. The characteristic
time of this rate is the correlation time τc of the phonon
bath which corresponds to the time for which the corre-
lation functions vanish. In a general way, τc is about 1
ps for phonons in low-dimensional molecular lattices [14].
We thus assume that this correlation time is suﬃciently
small in order to neglect the spatial correlations in the
phonon bath. As a result, the correlation functions of
the coupling ∆J which appear in Eq.(12) are nonzero if
n = n′+δ′ and n′ = n+δ, only. Therefore, by performing
both the time integration as well as the thermal average
in Eq.(12), the relaxation rate is ﬁnally expressed as

As shown in Eq.(13), the rate depends on the temper-
ature through the average number of phonons. More-
over, the temperature is involved in the deﬁnition of the
two-vibron wave functions due to the dressing eﬀect [16].
The relaxation rate exhibits two contributions connected
to the absorption (term proportional to n(Ω)) and to the
emission (term proportional to 1 + n(Ω)) of an acoustic
phonon, respectively. Note that Eq.(13) clearly shows
that the relaxation rate Wkσb is expressed as the sum
over the rate connected to the diﬀerent relaxation chan-
nels Wkσb→k′σ′ . As a result, each channel can be charac-
terized separately.

At this step, the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian

In this section, the previous formalism is applied to
compute the TVBS relaxation rate in an anharmonic
α-helix protein. The intramolecular anharmonicity is
described by a single parameter, namely the anhar-
monic constant A, which ranges between 0 and 10 cm−1

[16, 35, 36]. The small polaron binding energy EB is
taken as a parameter which extends from 0 to 15 cm−1.
The phonon cutoﬀ frequency Ωc is ﬁxed to 100 cm−1 and
the hopping constant is set to J = 8 cm−1.

The temperature dependence of the zero wave vector
TVBS-I relaxation rate (full circles) is shown in Figs.
1a and 1b for two typical situations. The empty circles
correspond to the rate for the relaxation over all the other
TVBS-I whereas the empty squares represent the rate for
the decay into the set of the second eigenstates
.
Ψkσ=2i
Note that as remained in Sec. II.B., such states refer to
either free or bound states (TVBS-II), depending on the
nonlinearity.

|

When A=8 cm−1 and EB = 4 cm−1 (Fig. 1a), the
relaxation rate exhibits a quasi-linear dependence ver-
sus the temperature, excepted at low temperature. More
precisely, the linear regime is reached when the tempera-
ture is greater than 50 K whereas the rate shows a power
law dependence at low temperature. The relaxation rate
is equal to 0.049 cm−1 at T = 5 K and reaches 7.64
cm−1 at T = 315 K. At low temperature, Fig. 1a clearly
indicates that the main mechanism for the relaxation in-
volves the decay of the zero wave vector TVBS-I into
the other TVBS-I. For instance, this channel represents
99.8 % of the relaxation at T = 5 K. As increasing the
temperature, the relaxation over the other TVBS-I de-
creases and the rate for the relaxation over the states
increases very slightly. Indeed, at T = 315 K,
Ψkσ=2i
|
the relaxation over the other TVBS-I represents 55.54 %.
However, the second channel, i.e. the relaxation over all
the states σ = 2, represents only 7.22 % which indicates
that 37.24 % of the relaxation involves the decay of the
TVBS-I into the TVFS continuum.

When EB = 12 cm−1 (Fig. 1b), the relaxation rate for
the zero wave vector TVBS-I exhibits almost the same
temperature dependence as in the previous case. Never-
theless, the rate is more important since it is equal to 0.19
cm−1 at T = 5 K and reaches 19.58 cm−1 at T = 315 K.
However, the main diﬀerence with the previous case orig-
inates in the nature of the relaxation channels. Indeed,
although the relaxation over the other TVBS-I remains
the main pathway at low temperature, this is no longer
true at high temperature. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1b,
the decay into the other TVBS-I represents almost 100
% of the relaxation at T = 5 K. However, as increasing
the temperature, the relaxation over the other TVBS-
I strongly decreases whereas the rate for the relaxation
over the states
increases and becomes the dom-
inate contribution (the transition occurs around 130 K).
At high temperature, i.e. T = 315 K, the relaxation ac-
cording to the second channel represents 85.60 % whereas
the decay into the other TVBS-I charaterizes 10.84 % of
the global rate. As a consequence, for such a strong non-
linear situation, the decay of the TVBS-I into the TVFS
is no more than 5 % at high temperature.

The behavior of the TVBS-I relaxation rate as a func-
tion of the anharmonicity is displayed in Figs. 2. The cal-
culations are performed at T = 310 K and for three dif-

ferent values of the small polaron binding energy. When
EB = 4 cm−1 (Fig. 2a), the rate slightly decreases as

when A = 0 and to 7.26 cm−1 when A = 10 cm−1. In
marked contrast, the rate for the decay into the other
TVBS-I ﬁrst increases to reach a maximum equal 6.02
cm−1 when A = 2 cm−1. Then, it decreases and is equal
to 3.48 cm−1 when A=10 cm−1. As shown in Fig. 2a, the
rate for the decay into the second eigenstates
Ψkσ=2i
is rather small whatever the anharmonicity although it
increases when A increases. Consequently, in this low
nonlinear regime (EB = 4 cm−1), the main part of the
relaxation of TVBS-I involves the decay into both the
other TVBS-I and the TVFS continuum.

|

As when increasing the small polaron binding energy,
(Fig. 2b and 2c), the TVBS-I relaxation rate behaves
in a similar way with respect to the anharmonicity and
slightly decreases as A increases. However, the rate in-
creases with EB since it is equal to 16.31 cm−1 when
EB = 8 cm−1 and A = 0 (Fig. 2b) and reaches 22.73
cm−1 when EB = 12 cm−1 and A = 0 (Fig. 2c).

a marked contrast, the relaxation pathways are strongly

rate for the decay into the other TVBS-I decreases as A
increases. By contrast, the rate for the decay into the
second eigenstates
increases. This second chan-
nel becomes slightly more eﬃcient than the ﬁrst channel
when the anharmonicity exceeds 7 cm−1. When A = 10
cm−1, the ﬁrst channel represents 21.92 % of the relax-
ation whereas the second channel characterizes 43.31 %
of the decay. Such a behavior appears more pronounced
when the small binding energy is set to EB = 12 cm−1.
In that case, Fig. 2c clearly shows that the decay of the
TVBS-I into the TVFS continuum is rather weak.
Its
contribution is less than 5 % when A is greater than 3.5
cm−1. For a small anharmonicity, the rates for the decay
into the other TVBS-I and into the second eigenstates
are of the same order of magnitude. However, as in-
creasing the anharmonicity, the second channel becomes
dominant since the corresponding rate represents almost
90 % of the global rate when A=10 cm−1.

Ψkσ=2i

The dependence of the TVBS-I relaxation rate on the
small polaron binding energy is shown in Fig.
3 for
T = 310 K, and A = 8 cm−1. The global rate evolves
in a quasi-linear way and varies from 1.98 cm−1 when
EB = 1 cm−1 to 23.19 cm−1 when EB = 15 cm−1. As
shown in Fig. 3, the more surprising results correspond
to the behavior of the rates connected to the ﬁrst and
to the second channel. Indeed, for small EB values, the
decay into the other TVBS-I is the dominant relaxation
pathway. For instance, when EB = 2 cm−1, this ﬁrst
channel represents 67.66 % of the relaxation whereas the
contribution of the second channel is 2.13 %. Therefore,
30.21 % of the relaxation involve the decay of the TVBS-I
into the TVFS continuum. However, as EB increases, the
rate connected to the second channel increases and be-
comes the main contribution for strong EB values. When

EB = 14 cm−1, the second channel represents 91.54 % of
the relaxation whereas the contribution of the ﬁrst chan-
nel is 6.81 %. Note that both channels contribute in a
similar way when EB is about 7.5 cm−1.

The correlation between the relaxation channels and
the nature of the two-vibron eigenstates, is illustrated in
Figs. 4 for T = 310 K and A = 8 cm−1. The upper panel
represents the corresponding two-vibron energy spectrum
whereas the lower panel displays the wave vector depen-
dence of the relaxation rates. More precisely, open circles
characterize the rate W0,1→kσ=1 for the decay of the zero
wave vector TVBS-I into the TVBS-I with wave vector k.
In the same way, open squares correspond to the decay
of the zero wave vector TVBS-I into the state
,
Ψkσ=2i
i.e. W0,1→kσ=2.
When EB = 4 cm−1 (Fig. 4a), the TVBS-II band
occurs at the end of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, only. For
the ﬁrst relaxation channel, i.e. the relaxation over the
other TVBS-I, the rate decreases as the modulus of the
wave vector increases. In other words, the decay into low
wave vector TVBS-I is the dominant relaxation pathway.
Although such an eﬀect is not correlated to the energy
spectrum, this is no longer true for the k dependence of
the rate connected to the second channel. Indeed, Fig.
4a clearly shows that the second channel opens at the end
of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, only, i.e. when the TVBS-II
band occurs. Therefore, this second channel becomes the
dominant relaxation pathway at the end of the Brillouin
zone. When EB = 10 cm−1 (Fig. 4b), the results are
slightly diﬀerent since EB is strong enough so that the
TVBS-II band is localized below the continuum over the
entire Brillouin zone. As a result, the second channel is
clearly the main mechanism for the relaxation whatever
the value of the wave vector.

In Fig. 5, the inﬂuence of the small polaron binding
energy on the relaxation rate of the
eigen-
state is shown at biological temperature (T=310 K) and
for A = 8 cm−1. As in the previous ﬁgures, full circles
characterize the global rate, empty circles represent the
rate for the decay into the TVBS-I and empty squares
correspond to the rate for the decay into all the other
eigenstates. In addition, empty triangles char-
Ψk,σ=2i
|
acterize the rate for the decay into the TVFS continuum.
The ﬁgure clearly shows that the system exhibits two
regimes depending on the value of EB.

For the small values of EB, i.e. typically EB < 8.5
cm−1, the rate increases in a quasi-linear way with EB.
It is equal to 1.65 cm−1 when EB = 1 cm−1 and reaches
13.67 cm−1 when EB = 8.0 cm−1. As shown in Fig.
5, the relaxation into both the TVBS-I and the other
eigenstates can be neglected. In other words,
Ψk,σ=2i
|
the main relaxation pathway corresponds to the decay
of the
eigenstate into the TVFS continuum.
When EB becomes greater than a critical value, the
global rate behaves in a diﬀerent manner with respect
to the small polaron binding energy. It increases more
rapidly than the previous linear regime to reach 38.75
cm−1 for EB = 15 cm−1. Moreover, the rate for the re-

laxation into the TVBS-I increases with EB whereas the
rate for the relaxation into TVFS slightly decreases. For
strong EB, the decay into TVBS-I represents 64 % of the
relaxation whereas the decay into TVFS corresponds to
33 %. Note that although the rate for the decay into the
eigenstates sligtly increases around the transi-
Ψk,σ=2i
|
tion, it decreases as EB increases and can be neglected
for a strong nonlinearity.

|

Ψk=0,σ=2i

Finally, the relaxation rate of the

eigen-
state versus the anharmonicity is shown in Fig. 6 for
T=310 K and for EB = 10 cm−1. As in Fig. 5, the
diﬀerent rates exhibit two regimes depending on the an-
harmonicity. For a small anharmonicity, i.e. A < 4 cm−1,
the global rate is almost independent on the anharmonic
parameter and it is equal to 17.00 cm−1.
In addition,
the decay into the TVFS continuum appears as the main
mechanism for the relaxation. In a marked contrast, for a
strong anharmonicity, i.e. A > 4 cm−1, the rate increases
as the anharmonic parameter increases and reaches 23.19
cm−1 when A = 10 cm−1. The rate for the relaxation
over the TVFS continuum decreases whereas the rate for
the decay into the TVBS-I increases. This latter rate
becomes the most important when A = 10 cm−1 so that
the decay into TVBS-I represents almost 50 % of the
relaxation.

V. DISCUSSION

To discuss and interpret the previous numerical results,
let us ﬁrst consider the behavior of the TVBS relaxation
rate at low temperature. Since the zero wave vector
TVBS-I lies at the bottom of the two-vibron energy spec-
trum, its decay involves phonon absorption, only. The
TVBS-I relaxation rate is thus proportional to the Bose-
Einstein distribution which selects the frequency range
In that context,
of the phonons which are exchanged.
transitions involving low frequency phonons takes place
at low temperature. Therefore, when the thermal energy
kBT is lower than the energy gap between bound and
free states, the TVBS-I can just decays into the other
TVBS-I, as shown in Fig. 1. Note that phonon emission
participates in the decay of the other two-vibron states
so that the corresponding rate reaches a ﬁnite value at
zero temperature (not considered in the numerical anal-
ysis). As a consequence, the low temperature behavior
of the rate does not depend on the system nonlinearity
and essentially originates in the shape of the phonon dis-
tribution.

This is no longer the case at biological temperature
for which an approximate expression of the relaxation
rate can be determined. To proceed, we assume that the
two-vibron bandwidth is smaller when compared with
both the thermal energy kBT and the phonon cutoﬀ
energy ~Ωc. Therefore, the Bose-Einstein distribution
can be linearized according to the temperature and the
distribution function F(Ω) (Eq.(14)) can be written as
Ω/Ωc. As a result, the relaxation rate Eq.(13)

Eq.(19) yields a rather good approximation which al-
lows us to interpret and to understand the numerical re-
sults. First of all, it accounts for the observed tempera-
ture dependence of the relaxation rate. Indeed, Eq.(19)
clearly shows that the rate increases in a linear way as
the temperature increases, in a perfect agreement with
the numerical results displayed in Figs. 1. This feature
originates in the linearization of the Bose-Einstein dis-
tribution. Note that the wave function Ψk,σ(m) depends
on the temperature in a complicated manner through the
dressing eﬀect [16]. However, our results indicate that
such a dependence remains rather small when compared
with the inﬂuence of the Bose-Einstein factor.

Ψkσ=1(1)

Then, the wave function dependence of the relaxation
rate allows us to understand the inﬂuence of the in-
2 and
tramolecular anharmonicity as shown in Figs.
6. For TVBS-I, Figs. 2 clearly show that the rate de-
creases as the anharmonicity increases.
In fact, since
TVBS-I refer to the trapping of the two vibrons onto
the same amide-I vibration, the wave function Ψkσ=1(m)
is maximum for m = 0 and decreases with m accord-
ing to a quasi-exponential way [16]. As a consequence,
when the anharmonicity increases, the trapping process
is enhanced so that the extension of the wave function
2 in-
around m = 0 is reduced. Therefore,

creases. In Fig. 6, the anharmonicity dependence of the
rate for the
eigenstate exhibits two regimes
which originates in the nature of the state itself. Indeed,
as pointed out in Sec. II. B.,
refers either to
a free or to a bound state (TVBS-II), depending on the
nonlinearity. Such a behavior is displayed in Fig. 6 since
the change of regime corresponds to the transition from a
TVFS to a TVBS-II. As shown in Ref. [16],
Ψk=0σ=2i
corresponds to a TVFS for a small anharmonicity.

sequently, the relaxation rate does not depend on A, as
shown in Fig. 6. By contrast, as when increasing the
anharmonicity, the state
becomes bounded.
It refers to a TVBS-II which characterizes the trapping

of the two vibrons onto two nearest neighbor amide-I vi-
brations. Therefore, when the anharmonicity increases,
the trapping process is enhanced so that the wave func-
tion Ψkσ=2(m) tends to localize around m = 1. The
corresponding rate suddenly increases with A as clearly
shown in Fig. 6.

Finally, the approximated expression of the rate gives
a comprehensive explanation of the inﬂuence of the small
polaron binding energy (see Figs. 3 and 5).
Indeed,
Eq.(19) clearly shows that the dependence of the rate
with respect to EB is twofold. First, the rate depends
linearly on EB. This feature originates in the fact that
the rate is proportional to the intensity of the coupling
between the dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remain-
ing phonons (see Eq.(11)). Then, the EB dependence is
included in the wave function dependence of the rate. As
when increasing the small polaron binding energy, the
trapping process involved in the formation of the TVBS-
I is enhanced so that Ψkσ=1(1) decreases. Therefore, the
linear evolution of the TVBS-I relaxation rate with re-
spect to EB is slightly damped, i.e. the rate evolves more
slowly than the corresponding linear law (see Fig. 3). As
previously, Fig. 5 clearly shows that the nature of the
exhibits a transition as a function of
state
the small polaron binding energy. For small EB values,
this state is a TVFS which the wave function does not
signiﬁcantly depend on the nonlinearity. Therefore, the
rate evolves in a linearly way versus EB. By contrast,
when the small polaron binding energy is suﬃciently im-
portant, this state becomes a TVBS-II [16]. As a con-
sequence, the trapping onto two nearest neighbor sites
is enhanced so that Ψkσ=2(1) increases to reach unity.
The corresponding relaxation rate suddenly evolves more
rapidly than the previous linear law (see Fig. 5).

For a TVBS, such a probability depends on the nature of
the bound between the two vibrons and ranges between
0 and 1. For instance, for a strong nonlinearity, i.e. for
strong values of both A and EB, TVBS-I refer to the
trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide-I vibra-

In a marked contrast, the nature of the relaxation

originate in the coupling between the two-vibron eigen-
states mediated by the vibron-phonon interaction and
characterized by the constant Zkσ→k′σ′ (see Eqs.(15)-
(16)). As shown in the deﬁnition of the coupling Hamil-
tonian ∆H (Eq.(9)), this interaction characterizes tran-
sitions between two-vibron states in the course of which a
single vibron is transfered from a given site to its nearest
neighbor.

To understand this feature, let us ﬁrst consider the re-
laxation channels connected to the decay of the TVBS-
I. Within the strong nonlinear limit, the TVBS-I wave
function is essentially localized around m = 0 so that
Ψkσ=1(m) is almost equal to δm,0. Therefore,
it is
straightforward to show that the coupling constant can

The relaxation channel for the TVBS-I corresponds to
the decay into states which favor the trapping of the two
vibrons onto two nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations, i.e.
2 is maximum. Within the
states for which
|
strong nonlinear limit, such states refer to the TVBS-II.
As a consequence, in a perfect agreement with the numer-
ical results displayed in Figs. 1a, 2c, 3 and 4b, Eq.(20)
clearly shows that the decay into TVBS-II is the main
mechanism for the TVBS-I relaxation. Note that both
2 are almost k independent
|
|
so that the rate for the decay over all the TVBS-II states
is equal to W . However, when the nonlinearity slightly
decreases, i.e. when either (or both) A and EB decreases,
the TVBS-I wave function delocalizes so that Ψkσ=1(0)
decreases and, in the same time, Ψkσ=1(1) increases. As
a result, the coupling between a given TVBS-I and the
other TVBS-I is turned on which opens the correspond-
ing relaxation channel. In the same way, the TVBS-II
wave function extends itself around m = 1 leading to the
decrease of Ψkσ=2(1). As a consequence, the coupling
between TVBS-I and TVBS-II decreases, as observed in
the numerical results.

|

Within the strong nonlinear limit, the TVBS-II wave
function is essentially localized around m = 1 so that
Ψkσ=2(m) is almost equal to δm,1. Therefore, by fol-
lowing the same procedure as in the previous para-
graph, it is straightforward to show that the coupling

but cannot relax over the other TVBS-II. As a result, the
rate for the decay of a given TVBS-II into a particular

is equal to W . Since the global relaxation rate for the
TVBS-II is equal to 3W/2, the rate for the relaxation over
the TVFS continuum is equal to W/2. These results are
in a rather good agreement with the numerical results
shown in Fig. 5. However, when the nonlinearity slightly
decreases, both the TVBS-I and TVBS-II wave functions
delocalize so that Ψkσ=2(1) and Ψkσ=1(0) decrease. In
that context, the relaxation rate for the decay of TVBS-
II into TVBS-I decreases, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6,
whereas the rate for the relaxation over TVFS increases.
In the same way, the relaxation channel connected to the
decay into the other TVBS-II opens because the wave
function Ψkσ=2(m) does not vanish any more for m = 0
or m = 2.

At this step, let us mention that the previous results
address the fundamental question of the manifestation of
the quantum localization, i.e. of the existence of quan-
tum breathers. Indeed, classical breathers describe time
periodic and spatially localized nonlinear vibrations. By
contrast, due to the translational invariance, the center
of mass of the two vibrons in a TVBS is fully delocalized
according to a Bloch wave. However, the localized nature
of a TVBS arises due to the trapping of the two quanta
around few sites. In that context, although a TVBS does
not describe a spatially localized ﬁeld, its degree of lo-
calization manifests itself through particular correlation
functions [37, 38]. Our results clearly establish that such
correlation functions are involved in the calculation of the
relaxation rate (see for instance Eq. (18)). As a conse-
quence, the dependence of the relaxation channels versus
the nature of the two-vibron states can be viewed as a
manifestation of the quantum localization of TVBS.

To conclude, let us note that the knowledge of the
relaxation rates allow us to characterize the population
dynamics of the two-vibron eigenstates in real time. To
illustrate this feature, let us consider the strong nonlinear
limit in which the relaxation schema is rather simple.
Indeed, the rates are almost wave vector independent so
that the system can be modeled as a three levels system
formed by the TVBS-I band, the TVBS-II band and the
TVFS band (see Fig. 7). The ﬁrst relaxation channel
corresponds to the decay of the TVBS-I band into the
TVBS-II band according to the rate W . The relaxation of
the TVBS-II band exhibits two main channels connected
to the decay into the TVBS-I band with the rate W and
to the decay into the TVFS band with the rate W/2.
Finally, TVFS are allowed to relax into the other TVFS,
only. Let PI , PII and PF denote the populations of these
bands. Therefore, the time evolution of these populations
is governed by a master equation expressed as

W PI + W PII
3W

˙PI =
−
˙PII = W PI −

˙PF =
PII
2

(22)

At this step, by performing the sum over the wave vector
k′ in Eq.(21), the rate for the decay over all the TVBS-I

The system Eq.(22), which can be solved straightfor-
wardly, allows us to follow the relaxation pathways in

9

real time. For instance, if we assume that the system is
initially set in the TVBS-I band, Eq.(22) clearly shows
that the population PI (t) decays so that the population
of the TVBS-II band increases. However, as PII (t) in-
creases with time, it tends to relax into the TVFS contin-
uum. Therefore, we observe the relaxation of the TVBS-
I band into the TVFS continuum through the TVBS-II
band. After a time t∗ = 21.5/W , both PI and PII can
be neglected whereas PF is equal to 0.99. At biological
temperature (T = 310 K), with the realistic parameters
A = 8 cm−1, EB = 12 cm−1, and J = 8 cm−1 we obtain
W = 21.36 cm−1 so that t∗ = 5.3ps.

Note that in a recent paper devoted to the TVBS re-
laxation in a molecular nanowire, it has been pointed out
that, for a one-dimensional phonon bath, a given TVBS
essentially decays into the other TVBS [14]. The origine
of the diﬀerent with the present work is twofold. First,
in Ref.[14], the vibron dynamics was described accord-
ing to a Hubbard model for bosons which yields a single
TVBS band (almost identical to the TVBS-I). Then, the
coupling with the thermmal bath was assumed to be re-
sponsibel for a random modulation of the frequency of
n bn, in marked con-
each molecule, i.e. ∆H
trast with the modulation of the vibron hopping constant
P
considered in this paper (see Eq.(9)).
To summarize, the present paper was devoted to the
characterization of the two-vibron relaxation mechanisms

∆ωnb+

≈

in an anharmonic α-helix protein. According to the small
polaron model developed in Ref. [16], it was shown that
the relaxation originates in the interaction between the
dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons.
This interaction is responsible for the occurrence of tran-
sitions between two-vibron eigenstates mediated by both
phonon absorption and phonon emission. At biologi-
cal temperature, we have established that the relaxation
rate does not depends signiﬁcantly on the nature of the
two-vibron state involved in the process. Therefore, for
realistic values of the parameters, the rate ranges be-
tween 10 and 40 cm−1 so that the corresponding life-
time is about 0.1 - 1.0 ps. Note that TVBS-II decay
more rapidly than both TVBS-I and TVFS, the ratio be-
tween the corresponding rates being of about 1.5. By
contrast, we have shown that the relaxation channels
strongly depends on the nature of the two-vibron states.
More precisely, the spatially localized nature of TVBS,
i.e. their breather-like character, is responsible for the
speciﬁcation of a given relaxation pathway. In that con-
text, TVBS-I, which correspond to the trapping of the
two quanta around the same amide-I vibration, tend to
decay into TVBS-II which refer to the trapping of the
two quanta around two nearest neighbor amide-I vibra-
tions. By contrast, TVBS-II decay into both TVBS-I
and TVFS, the ﬁrst channel being two times more eﬃ-
cient than the second one.

Figure Caption

Figure 1 : Temperature dependence of the zero wave
vector TVBS-I relaxation rate (full circles) for A = 8
cm−1 and for EB = 4 cm−1 (a) and EB = 12 cm−1 (b).
Empty circles correspond to the rate for the relaxation
over all the other TVBS-I whereas empty squares rep-
resent the rate for the decay into the set of the second
(see the text).

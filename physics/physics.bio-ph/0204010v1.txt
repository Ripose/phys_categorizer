We study the middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity (MCAfv) in humans using transcranial
Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). The time series of the axial ﬂow velocity averaged over a cardiac
beat interval is found to exhibit clear multifractal properties for healthy subjects. We observe a loss
of multifractality for subjects with migraine.

Migraine headaches have been the bane of humanity
for centuries, aﬄicting such notables as Ceasar, Pascal,
Kant, Beethoven, Chopin, and Napoleon. However, its
aetiology and pathomechanism have not to date been sat-
isfactorily elucidated. Herein we demonstrate that the
characteristics of the time series associated with cere-
bral blood ﬂow (CBF) signiﬁcantly diﬀers between that
of normal healthy individuals and migraineurs. Migraine
is considered by many to be a functional neurological
disorder in which CBF autoregulation failure may be re-
sponsible for the onset of symptoms. The results of our
data analysis support this interpretation.

Physiological signals, such as CBF time series, are
typically generated by complex self-regulatory systems
that process inputs with broad range of accessible val-
ues. Even though this type of time series may ﬂuc-
tuate in an irregular and complex manner, they fre-
quently exhibit self-aﬃne or fractal properties which can
be characterized by a single global parameter – the frac-
tal dimension D or equivalently the Hurst exponent H
(D = 2 − H)[1]. The salient property of mathematical
random fractal process is the existence of long-range cor-
relations for H 6= 1/2. The studies of the cardiac beat-to-
beat variability have shown the existence of strong long-
range correlations in healthy subjects and demonstrated
the breakdown of correlations in disease [2] (see also [3]
and references therein). A similar pattern was observed
in ﬂuctuations in the stride interval in human gait. The
strength of correlations was signiﬁcantly reduced both by
aging and a neurodegenerative disease. This eﬀect is fre-
quently referred to as the loss of complexity [4, 5, 6, 7].
Complexity decreases with the convergence of the Hurst
exponent on H = 1/2.

While the properties of monofractals are determined
by the global Hurst exponent there exists a more gen-
eral class of heterogenous signals known as multifractals
which are made up of many interwoven subsets with dif-
ferent local Hurst exponent h. The statistical properties
of these subsets may be characterized by the distribution
of fractal dimensions D(h). Ivanov et al [8] established
that the healthy human heartbeat interval exhibits multi-
fractal properties and uncovered the loss of multifractal-
ity for the life-threatening condition known as congestive
heart failure. Anticipating our result, herein we ﬁnd the
loss of multifractality in the time series of middle cere-
bral artery blood ﬂow velocity is almost entirely lost in
subjects with ”severe” migraine even in headache-free in-
tervals.

A healthy human brain is perfused by blood ﬂowing
laminarly through the cerebral vessels providing brain
tissue with substrates, such as oxygen and glucose.
It
turns out that CBF is relatively stable with typical values
between 45 and 65 ml/100g of brain tissue per second,
despite variations in systemic pressure as large as 100
T orr. This phenomenon is known as cerebral autoreg-
ulation and has been thoroughly documented not only
in humans but also in animals [9, 10]. Changes in cere-
brovascular resistance (CVR) of small precapillary brain
arteries is a major mechanism responsible for maintain-
ing relatively constant cerebral blood ﬂow. For example,
CVR may increase due to mechanoreceptor constrictions
of these arteries caused by the elevation of intracranial
pressure (ICP) and/or biochemically mediated constric-
tions associated with the decrease of CO2 arterial con-
tent. It is worth pointing out that changes in local cere-
bral activity may aﬀect the regional cerebral ﬂow (rCBF).

The increase in metabolism leads to the local drop of
extracellular pH (which is associated with the elevated
production of CO2, lactic acid, and other metabolites)
which in turn enhances the rCBF.

These complex cerebral ﬂow autoregulation mecha-
nisms are supposed to be inﬂuenced or even to be funda-
mentally altered in many pathological states [11]. How-
ever, despite the signiﬁcant advances in brain diagnostic
imaging techniques many functional aspects of CBF reg-
ulation are not fully understood. For example, migraine
– prevalent, hemicranial (asymmetric) headache is among
the least understood diseases. The leading neurovascu-
lar theory identiﬁes serotonin, a strong vasculomotoric
agent, as the main biochemical factor. In the last several
years, CBF in migraine patients has been studied using
diverse techniques such as Xenon-133 uptake measure-
ments, cerebral termography (CT), single proton emis-
sion tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomog-
raphy (PET). Although the pathophysiology of migraine
headache has not been unequivocally explained, some ex-
perimental data reveal clear interhemispheric blood ﬂow
asymmetry in some parts of brain of migraineurs even
during headache-free intervals [12, 13, 14].

Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography enables high-
resolution measurement of MCA ﬂow velocity. Even
though this technique does not allow us to directly de-
termine CBF values, it may help to elucidate the na-
ture and role of vascular abnormalities associated with
migraine. Some previous studies have discovered signif-
icant changes in cerebrovascular reactivity in migraine
patients [15]. In this work we look for the signature of
the migraine pathology in the dynamics of cerebral au-
toregulation. In particular, we investigate the fractal and
multifractal properties of the human MCAfv time series.
The dynamical aspects of the cerebral autoregulation
[16]. Keunen et al.
were recognized by Zhang et al.
[17, 18] applied the attractor reconstruction technique
along with the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm and the
concept of surrogate data to look for the manifestations
of the nonlinear dynamics in continuous waveforms of
TCD signals. Rossitti and Stephensen [19] used the rel-
ative dispersion of the MCAfv velocity time series to re-
veal its fractal nature. West et al.
[20] extended this
line of research by taking into account the more general
renormalization-group properties of fractal time series.
Both studies [19, 20] showed that the beat-to-beat vari-
ability in the ﬂow velocity has a long-time memory and is
persistent with the average value of the Hurst exponent
H = 0.85±0.04, a value consistent with that found earlier
for interbeat interval time series of the human heart.

We measured MCAfv using the Multidop T DWL Elek-
tronische Systeme ultrasonograph. The 2-MHz Doppler
probes were placed over the temporal windows and ﬁxed
at a constant angle and position. The measurements
were taken continuously for approximately two hours in
the subjects at supine rest. The study comprised eight

2

migraineurs (who used to experience 1-3 migraines per
month) and ﬁve healthy individuals. The migraineur
group underwent the standard diagnostic procedures e.g.
computer tomography, EEG) to exclude illnesses not as-
sociated with cerebral autoregulation. An example of a
typical measured MCAfv time series is shown in Figure
1 for the ﬁrst thousand of the recorded beats of the sub-
ject’s heart. The total time series has over eight thousand
data points for a two hour data record.

Successive increments of mathematical fractal random
processes are independent of the time step. They are
correlated with the coeﬃcient of correlation ρ which is
determined by the formula 22H = 2 + 2ρ. Thus for H 6=
1/2 there exist long-range correlations, that is, ρ 6= 0. It
turns out the Hurst exponent also determines the scaling
properties of the fractal time series. If y(t) is a fractal
process with Hurst exponent H, then yc = y(ct)/cH is
another fractal process with the same statistics. This
type of scaling is called renormalization. The variance of
self-aﬃne time series is proportional to ∆t2H where ∆t
is the time interval between measurements. A number
of algorithms which are commonly used to calculate the
Hurst exponent are based on this property.

Herein we employ the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
(DFA) introduced into the study of biomedical time series
N
by Peng et al. [21]. Let {vi}
i=1 be the experimental time
series of the middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity
(MCAfv) v. First, the time series is aggregated: y(k) =
k
i=1(vi − ¯v), k = 1, .., N , where ¯v is the average velocity.
P
Then, for segments of the aggregated time series of length
n the following quantity is calculated:

F (n) = v
u

N

n+n0

X
k=n0

[y(k) − yn0(k)]2,

(1)

where yn0 is a least square line ﬁt to the data segment
which starts at n0 and ends at n + n0. The bar in
the above equation denotes an average over all possible
starting points n0 of data segments of length n. Thus,
for a given data box size n, F (n) gives the characteris-
tic size of ﬂuctuations of the aggregated and detrended
time series. If the aggregated time-series is fractal then
F (n) ∼ nH , so one obtains the Hurst exponent from a
linear least-square ﬁt to F (n) on double log graph pa-
per. However, West has emphasized [1, 20] the impor-
tance of possible periodic modulations of quantities such
as F (n). These modulations are intimately related to
the renormalization-group properties of fractal time se-
ries and may be accounted for with the help of the fol-
lowing ﬁt function:

FX (n) = n

exp[α + λ cos(γ ln n)].

H

Here again the Hurst exponent is determined by the slope
of the ﬁtting curve, but now the curve also has a harmonic

modulation in the logarithm of the length n of the data
segment.

Fig. 2 shows the typical DFA analysis for a healthy
subject. The circles in this ﬁgure are the calculated val-
ues of F (n) and the solid line is the best renormalization
group ﬁt, cf. Eqn. (2). The best-ﬁt parameters are given
in the inset.

The average Hurst exponent obtained from ten mea-
surements of healthy subjects is equal to 0.85 and coin-
cides with the value reported previously [19, 20]. Supris-
ingly enough, the DFA analysis of 14 measurements of
migraineurs yielded the average value of H equal to 0.83.
While the observed diﬀerence is insigniﬁcant, we empha-
size that most of the measuremenents were performed in
headache-free intervals. Our further studies will address
the question as to whether the Hurst exponent changes
during the migraine episode.

We have already pointed out that in order to describe
the scaling properties of multifractal signals it is neces-
sary to use many local Hurst (or H¨older) exponents. For-
mally, the H¨older exponent h(x0) of a function f at x0 is
deﬁned as the largest exponent such that there exists a
polynomial Pn(x) of order n that satisﬁes the following
condition [22, 23, 24, 25]:

h
| f (x) − Pn(x − x0) |= O(| x − x0 |

)

(3)

for x in a neighborhood of x0. Thus the H¨older expo-
nent measures the singularity of a function at a given
point. For example, h(x0) = 1.5 implies that the func-
tion f is diﬀerentiable at x0 but its derivative is not. The
singularity lies in the second derivative of f . The singu-
larity spectrum D(h) of the signal may be deﬁned as the
function that for a ﬁxed value of h yields the Hausdorﬀ
dimension of the set of points x where the exponent h(x)
is equal to h [26].

In Fig. 3 we compare the averaged singularity spec-
trum of the healthy subjects with that of migraineurs.
It is apparent that the multifractal properties of mi-
graineurs are signiﬁcantly reduced which is reﬂected by
the vastly constricted interval for the distribution of frac-
tal dimension D(h).

It seems that the changes in the cerebral autoregu-
lation associated with migraine can modify the multi-
fractality of MCA blood ﬂow much more strongly than
monofractal properties characterized by the single global
Hurst exponent. The loss of multifractality may persist
in some subjects even in pain-free intervals. The more
detailed analysis of the clinical data will be presented
elsewhere.

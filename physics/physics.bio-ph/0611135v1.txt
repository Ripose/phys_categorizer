Abstract

We have studied the magnetophoretic particle separation and its nonlinear behavior of ferroﬂuids in mi-

crochannel which is proposed by Furlani. The magnetic gradient force is caused by an bias ﬁeld and the

polarized magnets and is found to be spatially uniform in the channel section which can be used for particle

selecting or separation. We have derived the equations of nonlinear magnetization of magnetic particles

which cause the harmonics of magnetophoresis. The Langevin model and generalized Clausius-Mossotti

equation used show how the normal and longitude anomalous anisotropic effect the permeability of fer-

roﬂuids, thus the magnetic force. Our analysis demonstrates the viability of using the microchannel system

for various bioapplications and other characterization of ﬂuid transporting and the time-varying magnetic

ﬁeld can be potentially used for an integrated magnetometer and inﬂuences the the viscosity and effective

permeability in ferroﬂuids.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays magnetophoretic microsystems have been paid great attention in bio-technology for

the integration of ”micro-total-analysis”(µTAS) [1] because of its high degree of detection and

selectivity. The biomaterials possessing low magnetic susceptibility can cause substantial contrast

between the labeled and unlabled materials [2]. Because of its polarization difference, the the

particles exhibit rich ﬂuid-dynamic behaviors such as magnetophoresis as well as various mag-

netic responses. Magnetic cell separation can be applied using magnetic beads which coated with

speciﬁc cell(core-shell microsphere), or the native magnetic susceptibility [3, 7]. In some special

cases such as blood cells, the red and white blood cells can be conducted using magnetophoretic

separation based on their native magnetic properties: diamagnetic or paramagnetic [4]. Magnetic

changes in red blood cells can also be used for separation of diseased cells [5]. In such continuous

microseparator, the ferromanetic wire(circular or square) put in close proximity under an external

bias ﬁeld cause strong magnetic ﬁeld with high magnetic gradience. Miniaturized Cell separator

can be integrated for various types of cell counting and collecting. The magnetophorsis with inte-

grated soft magnetic elements have some advantages over electrophoresis with electromagnets [6]

for they consume no heat and cause no damage and other negative effect on the bio-cells. Furlani

have recently demonstrated transport and capture behavior of magnetic particles such as Fe3O4 in

the microsystem which consists of an array of integrated soft magnetic elements embedded under

the microﬂuidic channel with also an external bias ﬁeld. The elements can be polarized by the bias

ﬁeld, thus producing nonuniform ﬁeld distribution which causes magnetophoretic force on mag-

netic particles within microchannel. The cubic soft magnetic elements replace the wire, producing

different separation and trap in geometry.

In the present paper we emphasize on the characteristics of the magnetic composites(such as

large magneticc constants and permanent moments) on the behavior of magnetophoresis in fer-

roﬂuids and donot consider the equations for particle motion. In experiment the slow-moving

transport is inﬂuenced by the viscous drag and thermal kinetics, thus the magnetic force can be

measured in the quasi-equilibrium movement.

Ferroﬂuids(or magnetic ﬂuids) are colloidal suspensions containing single domain nanosized

ferromagnetic particles dispersed in a carrier ﬂuid [8]. Since these particles can interact easily and

form crystal-like structure in the presence of applied bias magnetic ﬁelds, which in turn can affect

the viscosity and structural properties tremendously [9], particles in ferroﬂuids have a wide variety

2

of potential biomedical applications such as label and manipulate biomaterials. The dynamic(ac)

magnetic properties and magnetization-induced second-order harmonic generation are taken into

consideration in the system. In experiment, the measurement of an ac complex magnetic sus-

ceptibility of magnetic ﬂuids is a suitable method to study the relaxation process of the magnetic

dipoles of colloidal particles in magnetic ﬂuids [10, 11]. The second-order harmonic generation is

the phenomenon that the magnetization along the speciﬁc direction activates the originally silent

tensor components for the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility and is observed for sur-

faces or interfaces of ferromagnetic materials(thin ﬁlms) [12], or polar antiferromagnets [13] and

polar ferromagnets [14].

The saturation of magnetic particles considered here will be different from Furlani’s theory

and Han et al’s experiment, which cause the nonlinearity to appear by two effects: normal sat-

uration and anomalous saturation. In detail, the normal saturation arises from the higher orders

of Langevin function at large ﬁled region, and the anomalous saturation results from the particle

chains with higher and lower dipole moments [15] which is shifted under the inﬂuence of the

ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld inside the ferroﬂuid plays important role in the coupling between the two

effects, which is similar in electrorheological and magnetorheological ﬂuids. When suspension

having nonlinear characteristic is subjected to ac magnetic ﬁeld, the harmonics of magnetic sus-

ceptibility can be induced to appear [16]. Our analysis demonstrates that the magnetic force will

cause suitable separation across microchannel and will be affected by the anisotropic changes of

magnetic dipole arrays.

II. THEORY AND FORMALISM

A. Nonlinear magnetic moments in ferroﬂuids

In the standard case the magnetic induction B is proportional with the ﬁeld strength H0, and

have the relation B = µH0, where µ is the linear permeability. At strong ﬁeld intensities, non-
linearities are introduced as B = µeH0 + χH 2
H0 where third-order and higher-order nonlin-
0
ear coefﬁcients are dropped and χ and µe are the nonlinear magnetic susceptibility and effective

permeability for the longitudinal ﬁeld case. Here we assume the nonlinearity is not strong and

consider only the lowest-order nonlinearity for simplicity.

moments can be expressed as hMd · ei, where h· · · i denotes h· · · i =

In the ferroﬂuids, the average component in the direction of the ﬁeld of the magnetic dipole
R dXn1−i···e−u/kBT
R dXn1 e−u/kB T dX i, e
is the unit vector in the direction of the external ﬁeld, and X stands for the set of position and

R

orientation variables of all particles. Here u is the energy related to the dipoles in the sphere,

and it consists of three parts: the energy of the dipoles in the external ﬁeld ude, the magnetostatic

interaction energy of the dipoles umi, the non-magnetostatic interaction energy between the dipoles

unmi which is responsible for the short-range correlation between orientations and positions of the

dipoles such as London-Van der Waals interaction energy.

In this case, the effective permeability of ferroﬂuid µe is determined by the generalized

Clausius-Mossotti equation taking into consideration of dipolar interactions [15, 17]:

µ2 + gL(µe − µ2)

where µ2 represents the permeability of the host ﬂuid, N the number density of the particles, kB

the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, f the frequency of the applied magnetic ﬁeld,

τ the relaxation time of the particles, and α the magnetizability of the particles. Here τ can be ex-

pressed as τbτn/(τb + τn), where τb and τn are the brownian relaxation time and the n´eel relaxation

time respectively [20]. Our model describes the aggregation behavior in an external ﬁeld by intro-

ducing the longitudinal demagnetizing factor gL in Clausius-Mossotti equation, which deserves a

thorough consideration: Eq. (2) should be expected to contain both umi and unmi as gL is not equal

to 1/3. For an isotropic array of magnetic dipoles, the demagnetizing factor will be diagonal with

the diagonal element gL = 1/3. However, in an anisotropic array like ferroﬂuid, the demagnetiz-

ing factor can still be diagonal, but it deviates from 1/3. In fact, the degree of anisotropy of the

4

system is just measured by how gL is deviated from 1/3. It is worth noting that gL ≤ 1/3 in the

present longitudinal ﬁeld case. Furthermore, there is a sum rule for the factors, gL + 2gT = 1 [18],

where gT denotes the transverse demagnetizing factor. Such factors were measured by means of

computer simulations [19]. Thus, to investigate the anisotropic structural information of the array,

we have to modify the Clausius-Mossotti equation accordingly by including the demagnetizing

factor. When we studied the ﬁeld-induced structure transformation in ferroﬂuids, we can use the
generalized Clausius-Mossotti equation [17] by introducing a local-ﬁeld factor β′ which reﬂects

the particle-particle interaction between the particles in a lattice.

The magnetic dipole moment mi satisﬁes Langevin function mi = ms(cothγ − 1

γ ) where
γ = m0H0/(kBT ) and ms denotes the saturation magnetization of particles. For the whole array
i=1(mi(µ∞ + 2µ2)/3µ2)i where µ∞ represents the permeability
of magnetic moments, Md =
at frequencies at which the permanent dipoles cannot follow the changes of the ﬁeld but where the

P

atomic and the electronic magnetization are still the same as in the static ﬁeld [15]. Therefore, µ∞

is the permeability characteristic for the induced magnetization. In practice, µ∞ can be expressed

in the expression containing an intrinsic dispersion,

where µ∞(0) is the high-frequency limit permeability, and ∆µ stands for the magnetic disper-

sion strength with a characteristic frequency fc. Harmonics of magnetic moments can be obtained

through Fr¨ohlich model [21] by

µ∞ = µ∞(0) +

Here HF gives the magnetic ﬁeld inside the spherical situated in medium with permeability µe,

and has the form 3µe

In the presence of external oscillating time-varying magnetic ﬁeld cite[22], the magnetic parti-

cles will have nonlinear characteristics. In the experiment, the second term or higher order terms

of magnetization or force can be obtained using mixed-frequency measurements [23]. When we

apply an external ﬁeld such as H0(t) = Hdc + Hac(t) = Hdc + Hac sin ωt, the orientational

magnetization Mo will contain harmonics as

Mo = M (dc)

o + Mω sin ωt + M2ω cos 2ωt + M3ω sin 3ωt + · · · .

(11)

Here ω = 2πf and Hdc denotes the dc ﬁeld which induces the anisotropic structure in the

ferroﬂuids, and Hac(t) stands for a sinusoidal ac ﬁeld. Applying Eq. (11) into Eq. (4), (5) and (6),

after tedious calculation, the harmonics of magnetic moments can be expressed as

B. Magnetophoresis in microchannel

Now we will investigate the magnetophoretic behavior in microchannel. In a standard case,

a magnetically polarizable object will be trapped in a region of a focused magnetic ﬁeld, pro-

vided there is sufﬁcient magnetic response to overcome thermal energy and the magnetophoretic

force [24]. For a magnetically linear particle under magnetophoresis, the effective magnetic dipole

moment vector induced inside takes a form very similar to that for the effective dipole moment
~M0Re[CMF], where Reﬀ is the effective radius of spherical or
spheroidal particle and CMF is the Clausius-Mossotti factor along the direction of external ﬁeld.

It is noted that particles are attracted to magnetic ﬁeld intensity maxima when b > 0 as positive

magnetophoresis and negative magnetophoresis corresponds to b < 0. For spheroidal particle with
permeability µ2, CMF = 1

The microsystem consists of one integrated soft-magnetic elements which is embedded in a

nonmagnetic substrate beneath a microﬂuidic channel as shown in Fig. (1), in which the magnet

is 2w wide and 2h high. The magnetic particles in ferroﬂuids which pass through the channel can

separated according to the different ﬁeld gradient distribution, and the nonmagnetic particles will

be rinsed away. Y axe corresponds to the longitude case mentioned above. Below we will show

that when the number of magnetic element increases, the magnetophoresis will become more

uniform in both parallel and perpendicular direction to that of particle transport. The bias ﬁeld

7

~Hbias along y axe and ﬁeld from the magnet ~Hmag which is saturated(saturated magnetization Mes)
when the bias ﬁeld is added, both contribute to the magnetic ﬁeld exerted on the particle. Under

high frequency of bias ﬁeld(> 103Hz), the magnetization of magnet can be viewed constant. Thus

the magnetophoretic force is decomposed into two components:

across the channel can then be be accurately calculated. It could be noted from the equations above

that without the bias ﬁeld magnet-element cannot be magnetized and bias ﬁeld contributes to the

magnetophoretic force, but the bias ﬁeld itself produce no ﬁeld gradient in the microchannel.

Because the importance of the the contribution from the bias ﬁeld which causes harmonics of

magnetization in the particle, below we will calculate it alone.

III. RESULTS

Now we are in the position to study the behavior of magnetophoresis in ferroﬂuids. Specif-

ically, the external ﬁeld is set to be Hdc = Hac = 0.01A/m, high-frequency limit permeabil-
ity µ∞(0) = 8π × 10−7H/m, dispersion strength ∆µ = 32π × 10−7H/m, medium permeability
µ2 = 4π × 10−7H/m, permanent magnetic moment for each particle m0 = 10−13A/m, characteris-
tic frequency fc = 5×103Hz, the relaxation time τ = 5×10−7s, the number density N = 105m−3,
the length of magnet w = h = 50µm, Boltzmann constant kB = 1.38 × 10−23J/K, the effective
radius Reﬀ = 500nm and the average magnetization of single particle α = 10−5m−3.

Figure 2 displays the temperature and anisotropic effect on CMF in magnetophoresis. In Fig.

2(a), it is shown that increasing the temperature T causes slight increase in CMF(about 3%), thus

has little effect in magnetophoresis. From Fig. 2(b), the magneophoretic force exhibits strong

sensitivity to the anisotropic factor gL. When CMF is negative(particles will be repelled from

the maximum magnetic gradient), the larger gL is, the smaller repulsion will be. When CMF is

positive, with increaseing gL such an attractive force becomes stronger. Furthmore, we predict

8

the anisotropic-dependent crossover frequencies at which there is no net force on the cell particle.

The crossover frequency is monotonically increasing function of gL, dependent on whether the

variation of magnetophoretic force is negative or positive.

Figure 3 and 4 shows the oriental, fundamental, second- and third- order harmonics of the

magnetic force Fx and Fy induced by the bias ﬁeld mentioned above as a function of the ﬁeld

frequency for various gL in the longitudinal ﬁeld case. The particle is put in the position x=50nm

and y=300nm(see the coordinate in the inset of Fig. 5). The harmonics of magetization of particles

will change accordingly as the system alters from isotropic case (gL = 1/3) to anisotropic (gL 6=

1/3) because of the appearance of the particle chains.

In detail, stronger anisotropy (namely,

decreasing the longitudinal demagnizing factor gL) leads to larger magnetic force in the low-

frequency region. It can also be observed there is two plateaus in the range 0.03-3MHz and 102-

104MHz where the magnetic force have slight change and the second and third order harmonics

of magnetic force are negligible compared with lower order ones. In fact for the transverse ﬁeld

case, it could be concluded from the sum rule between gL and gT that gL + 2gT = 1. Because

of the coupling between the applied dc and ac magnetic ﬁelds, the even-order harmonics are also

induced to appear besides the odd-order harmonics for the longitudinal ﬁeld case, even though

only the cubic nonlinearity is considered due to the virtue of symmetry of the system. In addition,

the harmonics shown in Figs. 3 and 4 are nonzero at gL = 1/3 is because of the presence of

external ﬁelds (i.e., ude 6= 0), even though there is no particle interactions (i.e., umi = unmi = 0)

as gL = 1/3, the nonlinear behavior due to the normal saturation could still be induced to occur.

Fig. 5 and 6 displays the magnetic force which is spatially varying across the channel section,

when one and two magnets are embedded in the substrate under frequency 10KHz of magnetic

ﬁeld. In Fig. 6 the two magnets are embedded 250µm away and the x − y coordinate is placed

in the midpoint of magnets. Comparing Fig. 5(A) with Fig. 6(A), we ﬁnd that the force Fx

for the purpose of separating magnetic particles which is attractive in some regions and repulsive

in others along the x axe becomes more uniform, and the force Fy has similar nature. In detail

the absolute value of magnetic force Fx is symmetric in the x direction and become stronger on

the edge of the microchannel, while Fy is always negative which will repel the particles from

the magnets. The uniform separation technique will cause the magnetic particles with different

size or permeability become apart into layers in geometry which can in fact not only be used in

ferroﬂuids. The calculation also shows that when more magnets are uniformly embedded, the

separation of particles are more efﬁcient. It should be pointed out that the distance between the

9

nearby particles is important to cause spatially uniform magnetic force and it can be chosen for

different purpose of separation which may be determined by the capture efﬁciency for a speciﬁc

particle sorting or transporting. The time-varying magnetic ﬁeld can be potentially used for an

integrated magnetometer and inﬂuences the the viscosity and effective permeability in ferroﬂuids.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have studied the magnetophoretic particle separation of ferroﬂuids in microchannel and

its nonlinear behavior. The magnetic gradient force is caused by an bias ﬁeld and the polarized

magnets and is found to be spatially uniform in the channel section which can be used for particle

selecting or separation. We have derived the equations of nonlinear magnetization of magnetic

particles which cause the harmonics of magnetophoresis. The Langevin model and generalized

Clausius-Mossotti equation used show how the normal and longitude anomalous anisotropic effect

the permeability of ferroﬂuids, thus the magnetic force. Our analysis demonstrates the viability

of using the microchannel system for various bioapplications and other characterization of ﬂuid

transporting.

In the development of multiscale biological models it is crucial to establish a connection between
discrete microscopic or mesoscopic stochastic models and macroscopic continuous descriptions based
on cellular density.
In this paper a continuous limit of a two-dimensional Cellular Potts Model
(CPM) with excluded volume is derived, describing cells moving in a medium and reacting to each
other through both direct contact and long range chemotaxis. The continuous macroscopic model is
obtained as a Fokker-Planck equation describing evolution of the cell probability density function.
All coeﬃcients of the general macroscopic model are derived from parameters of the CPM and a very
good agreement is demonstrated between CPM Monte Carlo simulations and numerical solution
of the macroscopic model.
It is also shown that in the absence of contact cell-cell interactions,
the obtained model reduces to the classical macroscopic Keller-Segel model. General multiscale
approach is demonstrated by simulating spongy bone formation from loosely packed mesenchyme
via the intramembranous route suggesting that self-organizing physical mechanisms can account for
this developmental process.

A large literature exists studying continuous limits of
point-wise discrete microscopic models for biological sys-
tems. For example, the classic Keller-Segel PDE model
of chemotaxis [1] was derived from a discrete model with
point-wise cells undergoing random walk [2-5]. How-
ever, many biological phenomena require taking into ac-
count the ﬁnite size of biological cells, and much less
work has been done on deriving macroscopic limits of mi-
croscopic models which treat cells as extended objects.
The mesoscopic Cellular Potts Model (CPM), ﬁrst in-
troduced by Glazier and Graner [6, 7], has been used
as a component of multiscale, experimentally motivated
hybrid approaches, combining discrete and macroscopic
continuous representations, to simulate, among others,
morphological phenomena in the cellular slime mold Dic-
tyostelium discoideum [8], vascular development [9] and
the proximo-distal increase in the number of skeletal el-
ements in the developing avian limb [10].

One of the earliest attempts at combining mesoscopic
and macroscopic levels of description of cellular dynam-
ics was described in [11] where the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
for a collection of noninteracting randomly moving cells
was derived from a one-dimensional CPM. Recently a
microscopic limit of subcellular elements model [12] was
derived in the form of an advection-diﬀusion partial dif-
ferential equation for cellular density.
In previous pa-
pers [13, 14] we studied the continuous limit of 1D and
2D models of individual cell motion in a medium, in the
presence of an external ﬁeld but without contact cell-cell
interactions.

This paper describes a theoretical analysis leading to
a continuous macroscopic limit of the two-dimensional

mesocopic CPM with contact cell-cell interactions. Our
approach, which is based on combining mesoscopic and
macroscopic models, can be applied to studying biolog-
ical phenomena in which a nonconﬂuent population of
cells interact directly and via soluble factors, forming an
open network structure. Examples include vasculogene-
sis [9, 15, 16, 17] and formation of trabecular, or spongy,
bone [18, 19, 20] to be described below.

The CPM, deﬁned on a multidimensional lattice, al-
lows simulation of both cell-cell contact and chemotactic
long distance interactions, along with extended cell rep-
resentations. In deriving below our continuous model we
assume that cells interact with one another subject to
an excluded volume constraint. In the CPM a multidi-
mensional integer index is associated with each lattice

site (pixel ) to indicate that a pixel belongs to a cell of
particular type or medium. Each cell is represented by
a cluster of pixels with the same index. Pixels evolve
according to the classical Metropolis algorithm based on
Boltzmann statistics, and the eﬀective energy

E = EAdhesion + EP erimeter + EF ield.

Namely, if a proposed change in a lattice conﬁguration
results in energy change ∆E, it is accepted with proba-

where T represents an eﬀective boundary ﬂuctuation am-
plitude of model cells in units of energy. Since the cells’
environment is highly viscous, cells move to minimize
their total energy consistent with imposed constraints
and boundary conditions. If a change of a randomly cho-
sen pixels’ index causes cell-cell overlap it is abandoned.
Otherwise, the acceptance probability is calculated using
the corresponding energy change. If the change attempt
is accepted, this results in changing location of the center
of mass and dimensions of the cell.

In this paper we assume that each cell has a rectangu-
lar shape, that it moves or changes its shape by adding
or removing a row or column of pixels (see Figure 1)
and that cells come into direct contact with each other.
They also interact with each other over long distances
through producing diﬀusing chemicals and reacting to
local chemical gradients (process called chemotaxis). Al-
though we model adhesion between cells and the extra-
cellular matrix (ECM), we neglect cell-cell adhesion and
take into account cell-cell interaction from excluded vol-
ume constraint meaning that cells cannot occupy the
same volume. Under these assumptions terms in the
Hamiltonian (1) have the following forms. EAdhesion
phenomenologically describes the net adhesion or re-
pulsion between the cell surface and ECM and it is a
product of the binding energy per unit length, JCM ,
and the length of an interface between the cell bound-
ary and ECM: EAdhesion = 2Jcm(Lx + Ly). EPerimeter
deﬁnes an energy penalty function for dimensions of
a cell deviating from the target values LTx and LTy :

EP erimeter = λx(Lx
and λy are constants. Cells can move up or down gradi-
ents of both diﬀusible chemical signals (i.e., chemotaxis)
and insoluble ECM molecules (i.e., haptotaxis) described
by EF ield = µ c(r)LxLy, r = (x, y) where c(r) is a local
concentration of particular species of signaling molecules
in the extracellular space and µ is an eﬀective chemical
potential.

If excluded volume is not taken into account (i.e. as-
suming ψx = ψy = 0) Eqs. (5) and (6) reduce to the
classical Keller-Segel system [1] which has a ﬁnite time
singularity and which was used for modeling collapse (ag-
gregation) of bacterial colonies [21]. Addition of excluded
volume signiﬁcantly slows down collapse and, therefore,
Eqs. (5) and (6) can be used for simulating cellular ag-
gregation for a much longer period of time. Spongy bone
formation considered in this paper, is accompanied by
secretion of a viscous or solid ECM (see below) which
quickly stabilizes a transient or metastable arrangement
of cells into a persistent microanatomy and therefore also
prevents collapse.

steps was δt = ǫ2
t = 0.0001, ǫ = 0.01. Discrete form
of the equation (6) was used to calculate the chemical
ﬁeld dynamics on a 200
200 lattice with the time step
∆tc = 0.0125 and initial chemical ﬁeld chosen in the
form of c0(x, y) = (x−70)2+(y−60)2
. The typical size of
the mesh used in the continuous model was 1000
1000
and the time step was 0.002. A large number of CPM
simulations have been run to guarantee a representative
statistical ensemble. We assumed that at each time step
each cell released chemical content a∆tc which was then
distributed to four nearest chemical lattice sites.

In what follows, we illustrate the eﬃcacy of the model
by applying it to the formation of spongy bone via
the intramembranous route. In this developmental phe-
nomenon, which generates portions of the skull, maxilla
and mandible in vertebrate organisms, bone cells, or os-
teoblasts, diﬀerentiate directly from loosely packed mes-
enchymal cells. The diﬀerentiating cells secrete TGF-

the model cells in the CPM simulations behaved qualita-
tively like the living cells that form multicellular branches
in spongy bone by intramembranous ossiﬁcation(Figure
3c). In contrast to earlier suggestions that the trabecular
arrangement of spongy bone is based on pre-existing vas-
cular patterns [23], or later-forming patterns of mineral
deposition [19, 20], our results suggest that it can arise
from the self-organizing behavior of mesenchymal cells
interacting with their ECM.

tion while simultaneously inducing production of ECM
[22], which in developing bone is termed osteoid [18].

Depending on local conditions, including initial cell
density, the bone will progress to a dense state or stop
at a spongy state, in which bony rods or trabeculae form
a swiss-cheese-like network (see Figure 3c) that eventu-
ally contains marrow tissue originating from the circu-
lation. Our mesoscopic and macroscopic model simula-
tions which start with initially dilute populations of cells
in a chemotactic ﬁeld, subject to an excluded volume
constraint, result in a transiently appearing set of inter-
connected multicellular trabeculae (see Figures 3a and
3b) similar to the experimental picture (Figure 3c). In
particular, in the simulations and the developing tissue
there are many nodes from which three branches extend,
but few with larger numbers.

In summary, we have derived a macroscopic continu-
ous model (5) from a mesoscopic two-dimensional CPM
with excluded volume constraint and coupled it to a
model of chemotaxis (6). Numerical simulations conﬁrm
a very good agreement between the CPM and macro-
scopic equations. Numerical analysis of the macroscopic
model facilitated determination of conditions promoting
formation of a lattice-like aggregation pattern. This per-
mitted us to locate the parameter ranges within which

We have applied a simple statistical-mechanics G¯o-like model to the analysis of the PIN1 WW
domain, resorting to Mean Field and Monte Carlo techniques to characterize its thermodynamics,
and comparing the results with the wealth of available experimental data. PIN1 WW domain is a
39-residues protein fragment which folds on an antiparallel β-sheet, thus representing an interesting
model system to study the behavior of these secondary structure elements. Results show that
the model correctly reproduces the two-state behavior of the protein, and also the trends of the
experimental φT -values. Moreover, there is a good agreement between Monte Carlo results and the
Mean-Field ones, which can be obtained with a substantially smaller computational eﬀort.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the folding process of proteins is one
of the most challenging issues of biochemistry which re-
quires sophisticated simulations at atomic resolution gen-
erally referred as all-atom methods. At present the large
incompatibility between folding time scales and regimes
explored by all-atom simulations makes the folding pro-
cess not yet accessible to these powerful computational
approaches. Even though very encouraging progress have
been achieved, their applicability remains restricted to
the study of peptides and fragments of proteins [1, 2].
In addition, the comparison to experiments requires an
accumulation of folding events to gain a enough large
statistics further narrowing the route to the to full-atom
techniques. These limitations suggest resorting to mini-
malist models which adopt a less accurate description of
protein chains, residue-residue and residue-solvent inter-
actions [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Approximate representations re-
duce the computational costs and, with a certain amount
of uncertainty, allow to follow all the stages which bring
a protein into its native fold. The use of simpliﬁed mod-
els within a statistical mechanical approach to protein
folding is grounded on the assumption that not all the
chemical details need to be retained to understand and
describe the basic properties of folding processes. Of
course the approximations, that this kind of approach
introduces, must ensure that the basic principles of bio-
chemistry are fulﬁlled to keep a correct description of
the real molecules. Several years ago a simple model
was proposed by N. G¯o [8] to attain a phenomenologi-
cal but complete description of the folding reaction. The
model replaces all non-bonded interactions by attractive
native-state contact energies. This recipe, which can be
applied only when native structure is known, implements
the idea that a reasonable energy bias toward the native
state could capture the relevant features of the folding
process. This kind of modelling removes high energetic

barriers along the pathways toward the native conforma-
tion (which lies in a deep minimum), and produces rela-
tively smooth energy landscapes. As a result the folding
”funnel” [9, 10] leading to the native state is very smooth
so the folding process results ”ideal”. Folding events sim-
ulated through G¯o-like potentials take only few nanosec-
onds making possible to obtain statistically meaningful
results for generic proteins and polypeptide chains. Since
G¯o-like models lack any energetic frustration, the scope
of their applications is related to the investigation of the
role of geometric frustration and conﬁgurational entropy
in the folding process. Their success in providing a rea-
sonable account for kinetic properties of the folding pro-
cess is related to the assumption that folding kinetics is
mainly determined by native geometry, together with na-
tive state stability, and this view is indeed supported by
several experimental works [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Along
the lines indicated by the G¯o-philosophy other simpliﬁed
models exploiting the information present in the native
state have been proposed [16, 17, 18, 19]. In this paper
we continue our analysis [20] of one of this G¯o-like mod-
els, the Finkelstein model [19, 21], and apply it to the
study of the Pin1 WW domain (pdb code 1I6C) which
has a well deﬁned and simple native structure made of
two slightly bent antiparallel beta-sheets. Its distinctive
feature, which is also reﬂected in its name, is the presence
of two Triptophanes (W), located 20-residues apart from
one another. Its structure, with a simple topology, lacks
of all those features that can complicate the modeling.
Thus this molecule represents a suitable candidate to ex-
plore the kinetic and thermodynamic factors responsible
for the formation of β-sheets and their stability, and is
also a suitable benchmark through which validate models
and theories. The Finkelstein model is particularly suit-
able for analyzing the folding thermodynamics of two-
state proteins and the WW domain is known to fold in a
two state scenario so we can test whether the model can
faithfully reproduce the known experimental data [22]

about WW domain folding.

The organization of the paper is as follow. In section
II we discuss the model and its assumptions. In section
III we present the Monte Carlo and Mean Field methods
we adopt, and in section IV we report and discuss our
results. Finally, section V is dedicated to the concluding
remarks.

II. DESCRIPTION OF FINKELSTEIN MODEL

Finkelstein model assumes a simple description of the
polypeptide chain, where residues can stay only in an
ordered (native) or disordered (non-native) state. Then,
each micro-state of a protein with L residues is encoded in
a sequence of L binary variables s = {s1, s2, ..., sL}, si =
{0, 1}. Residues with si = 1 (si = 0) are in their native
(non-native) conformation. When all variables take on
the value 1, the protein is considered folded, whereas the
random coil corresponds to all 0’s. Because each residue
can be in one of the two states, ordered or disordered,
the free energy landscape consists of 2L conﬁgurations.
This enormous reduction in the number of conﬁgurations
available to a protein is a quite delicate point because it
is a restrictive feature of the model. However this crude
assumption, already employed in [23], is the simplest one
leading to a two state behaviour of the folding.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian (indeed, a free-energy func-

tion) is

H(s) = ε

∆ij sisj − T S(s) ,

(1)

where S(s) is given by:

i<j
X

q
"

L

i=1
X

S(s) = R

(1 − si) + Sloop(s)
#

.

(2)

R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature.
The ﬁrst term in Eq. (1) is the energy associated to native
contact formation. Non native interactions are neglected:
this further assumption can be just tested a posteriori
and it is expected to hold if, during the folding process,
the progress along the reaction coordinate is well depicted
on the basis of the native contacts. That is, the reaction
coordinate(s) must be related to just the native contacts.
Moreover, such progress must be slow with respect to all
other motions, so that all non-native interaction can be
“averaged-out” when considering the folding pathways.
∆ij denotes the element i,j of the contact matrix, whose
entries are the number of heavy-atom contacts between
residues i and j in the native state. Here we consider
two amino-acids to be in contact if there are at least
two heavy atoms (one from aminoacids i and one from
j) separated by a distance less than 5˚A. The matrix ∆
embodies the geometrical properties of the protein.

The second term in Eq. (1) is the conformational en-
tropy associated to the presence of unfolded regions along
the chain, and vanishes in the native state.

2

More precisely the ﬁrst term in Eq. (2) is a sort of
“internal” entropy of the residues: qR represents the en-
tropic diﬀerence between the coil and the native state
of a single residue. This can be noticed by considering
that in the fully unfolded state Sloop vanishes and the
remaining entropy is qLR only.

The term RSloop in Eq. (2) is the entropy pertaining to
the disordered closed loops protruding from the globular
native state [18]; it reads:

Sloop(s) =

J(rij )

(1 − sk)sisj .

(3)

j−1

i<j
X

k=i+1

According to [19], we take:

J(rij ) = −

ln |i − j| −

(4)

5
2

r2
ij − d2
Ad|i − j|

.

In this way the conﬁguration of a disordered loop going
from residues (i + 1) to (j − 1), with i and j in their
native positions, is assimilated to a random walk with
end to end distance rij , the latter being the distance be-
tween Cα atoms of residues i and j in the native state.
The parameters d = 3.8 ˚A and A = 20 ˚A are the
average distance of consecutive Cα along the chain and
persistence length respectively. The entropy of one loop
closure (4) diﬀers from the classical result −3R/2 ln(N )
pertaining to a free Gaussian chains [24]. The presence
of the factor 5/2, instead of 3/2, stems from the fact that
a loop exiting the globule must lie completely outside of
it, to account for the self-avoidance. Thus, the spatial
domain occupied by the globule results in a forbidden
region for the disordered loop, and this simple sterical
constraint, reducing the number of accessible conforma-
tions, increases the entropy loss obtained from the closure
of the loop [18].

III. METHODS

A direct comparison between model predictions and
experimental results requires a tuning of the coeﬃcients
q and ε in the energy function Eq. (1). In our compu-
tation we set q = 2.31 and regarded ε as an adjustable
parameter. We determined it by imposing that the mean-
ﬁeld speciﬁc heat exhibits its “collapse” peak in corre-
spondence to the experimental transition temperature
T = 332 K [22]. Despite the use of a simple MF ap-
proach, we expect that this procedure yields a correct es-
timate for ε, since the MF is known to reproduce the ther-
modynamics properties of the Finkelstein model pretty
faithfully [20]. Once determined the optimal choice of q
and ε, we performed Monte Carlo simulations to inves-
tigate the thermal folding of the WW domain. We im-
plemented a Metropolis algorithm with transition rates
between states j and k

w(j → k) = exp[(Hj − Hk)/RT ]

Fvar ≤ F0 + hH − H0i0 ,

(5)

g′(mi) = ε

∆ij mj − RT

q −

R being the gas constant, T the temperature and Hj the
Finkelstein energy of state j, according to Eq. (1).

We applied the multiple histogram technique (MHT)
[25] to reconstruct the system density of states (DOS)
in the full range of accessible energies. To this end,
we carried out MC runs at 50 equally spaced temper-
atures in the range 273 − 383 K, and for each run
we collected the energy histogram to estimate the sta-
tistical weight of all conﬁgurations with a certain en-
ergy. Through the Swendsen-Ferremberg procedure [25]
these histograms were optimally linearly combined to
extract the whole DOS and thus compute the entropy
S(E) = R ln[g(E)] up to an additive constant. The
knowledge of entropy allows evaluating the free energy
proﬁles F (E) = E − T S(E), and other relevant thermo-
dynamical quantities for the folding, such as the speciﬁc
heat.

In its variational formulation [26], Mean Field Approx-
imation, for a system with Hamiltonian H and corre-
sponding free-energy F , amounts to minimizing

where H0 is a solvable trial Hamiltonian F0 is the corre-
sponding free-energy, both depending on free parameters
x = {x1 · · · xL} (variational parameters). Minimization
leads to the self consistent equations that in their general
form read

∂H0

(H − H0)

with l = 1, . . . , L. We have implemented diﬀerent ver-
sions of the MFA for the model that diﬀer each from the
other by the choice of the trial Hamiltonian.

The standard MFA employees as the trial Hamiltonian:

where

Thermal averages, performed through the Hamiltonian

proximate average site “magnetization” mi = hsii0 de-
pends only on the ﬁeld xi, and is given by

Instead of working with external ﬁelds xi’s, it is more in-
tuitive to use the corresponding “magnetizations” mi’s,
writing Fvar as a function of the mi’s. Due to the choice
of H0, Eq. (7), and to the expression Eq. (10), evaluat-
ing the thermal average hHi0 amounts to replacing, in
the Hamiltonian Eq. (1), each variable si by its thermal
average mi. In the end we get:

Fvar(m, T ) = ε

g(mi) ,

(11)

where g(u) = u ln(u) + (1 − u) ln(1 − u) and S(m) is
obtained from Eq. (2) by substituting si → mi. The
last term corresponds to F0 − hH0i0 in Eq. (5): it is the
entropy associated to the system with Hamiltonian H0
and is the typical term that stems from this kind of MFA
[26]. The minimization of function Eq. (11) with respect
to m leads to self-consistent equations:

∂Sloop(m)

Equations (12) can be solved numerically by iteration
and provide the optimal values of the magnetizations
that we denote by m∗. Once the set of solutions m∗
is available, we can compute the variational free-energy
Fvar(m∗) that represents the better estimate of the sys-
tem free-energy F . Free energy proﬁles are evaluated
performing the minimization after the introduction of
Lagrange multipliers, corresponding to the constraint of
considering states with a ﬁxed number of native residues.
A diﬀerent MFA consists in taking a trial Hamiltonian
that accounts exactly for the entropic term of the original
one, resorting to the procedure introduced in [27], and
approximates the interactions by introducing a weight
dependent on the number of native residues in the con-
ﬁguration. Namely, we consider the set of conﬁgurations
of the proteins with M native residues (M = 0, ..., L) and
take as the trial Hamiltonian

weakened by a factor (M − 1)/(L − 1) (accounting for
the fact that not all the residues are native), times the
external ﬁeld xi, to be ﬁxed by the mean ﬁeld procedure.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The folding transition is signalled by the behavior of
the speciﬁc heat, which develops a peak identifying the
Tf . Standard MF peak position is imposed to the correct
experimental folding temperature to ﬁt the parameters;
notice though that MC peak is correctly found at the
same position, providing a consistency check between the
two methods (Fig. 1).

Pin1 WW domain is reported to be a two-state
folder [22]: this is recovered by both the MC and the
MF approximations, as can be seen in Fig. 2. MC and
the more complicated MF approach reproduce with rea-
sonable accuracy the experimental signal.

The two-state nature of the protein can also be seen in
the free-energy proﬁles Figs. 3,4. It is remarkable that the
barrier separating folded from unfolded conformations is
quite ﬂat, especially in the MC case, so that mutations

could likely induce relevant changes in its position with
just a slight change in the energies, a scenario which is
indeed suggested in Ref. [22].

Monte Carlo and Mean Field free energy proﬁles allow
to estimate the stability gap ∆G and the folding barrier
∆G† as a function of temperature. The comparison with
the corresponding experimental curves (Ref. [22])

ported in Fig. 5.

Notice that all methods compare most favorably with
the experimental results in the vicinity of Tf , which is to
be expected, since the model only accounts for the ge-
ometry, and not for the details of the interactions, with
their temperature dependence in the hydrophobic contri-

butions. MC gives a good estimate of both the stability
gap and the barrier, while standard mean ﬁeld gives a
reasonable description of the folding barrier, but over-
estimates the stability. On the other hand, the more
complicated MF scheme recovers correctly the stability,
but it overestimates the barrier, at least if we consider,
as we did in Ref. [20], just the proﬁle of F0 (relying
on the good approximation that F0 provides to Fvar),
without resorting to the more correct, but computation-
ally expensive minimization of a constrained Fvar. A
more accurate analysis of free energy proﬁles within this
MF scheme is left for future work. In the following, we
analize standard MF and MC results concerning another
important experimental quantity, namely the φT -values
(Fig. 6). φT -values are deﬁned as

and give an idea of the entropy of the barrier compared
to that of the native state, providing a measure of the
proximity of the barrier to the folded state. The exper-
imental results show a monotonically increasing, contin-
uous function, spanning a wide range of values. MC and
MF results indeed agree in the monotonically increasing
behavior, reﬂecting thus the Hammond behavior [28, 29],
even if in a discretized version. Indeed they show a series
of discrete jumps that, in the case of MC simulations,
are not simply an eﬀect of the binning in the reaction
coordinate, but seem to suggest sharp movements in the
barrier position: sudden changes in φT are in complete
correspondence to shifts in the position of the barrier, as
reported in Fig. 6.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The application of the Finkelstein model to protein

values at a give T are evaluated as the energy coordinate

native state (independent from T: E = −53.32 Kcal/mol with
our choice of the parameters). Notice how the shifts in φT
correspond to those in the barrier position.

the parameter ε in order to reproduce the correct transi-
tion temperature, is able to describe correctly the ther-
modynamics of the folding process, at least in the case
of simple two-state behavior. Indeed, the estimate of the
folding barrier, both in the case of MF approximation as
well as for MC simulations, lies within a relative error of
about 15% from the experimental estimate in all the re-
gion of experimental measures. This is indeed interesting,
as the model lacks every detail about the nature of the
residues, dealing with all atomic contacts in the ground-
state on the same footing. Moreover, the estimate of the
entropy is based on the theory of noninteracting poly-
mers, and neglects possible clashes of the protruding un-
folded loops with the folded part of the protein.

Another important result concerns the φT -values: both
MF and MC results recover the non-decreasing nature of
experimental values, with MC providing a better esti-
mate of the slope than MF. At diﬀerence with the exper-
imental values, though, theoretical φT -values increase in
a discontinuous fashion, with abrupt changes followed by
steady plateaus. This behavior is related to the fact the
the transition state is quite broad, so that the actual
free-energy maximum, determining the barrier, jumps
through diﬀerent values of the reaction coordinate (the
number of native residues or the energy). This is an as-
pect that deserve further analysis, also because the sim-
ple three-state model, with a negligible intermediate, put
forward by the author of Ref. [22] does not seem to be
able to reproduce the experimental results with suﬃcient
accuracy, and a satisfactory description of the transition
state of this protein has still to be found. Probably, it
will require the introduction of residue heterogeneities
and more accurate studies on the dynamics of the sys-

tem.

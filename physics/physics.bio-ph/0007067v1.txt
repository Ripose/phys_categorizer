By analyzing the movements of quiet standing persons by means of wavelet statistics, we observe
multiple scaling regions in the underlying body dynamics. The use of the wavelet-variance function
opens the possibility to relate scaling violations to diﬀerent modes of posture control. We show
that scaling behavior becomes close to perfect, when correctional movements are dominated by the
vestibular system.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the last years evidence has been compiled that many physiological systems and processes exhibit scaling laws
in the corresponding time series [1], due to the existence of control mechanisms with a minimum degree of complexity.
Irregularities in physiological processes may lead to scaling violations which recently have successfully been used to
detect abnormalities of the underlying biological systems such as the human heart [2,3].

For some reason nature choose to let man walk upright. This has led, over time, to a highly complex balance
system, which is not based on one single physical principle alone. Balance of a normal human being is the result of
a most likely nonlinear [4] superposition of sensory signals originating from the vestibular, visual and somatosensory
systems, which govern a cascade of muscular correctional movements in order to maintain an upright position, for
an overview see e.g. [5]. The existence of three diﬀerent mechanisms for maintaining balance provides the body with
backup systems.
If the vestibular system is severely damaged or not fully functioning, visual and somatosensory
information will gain importance and take up for the loss.

Human posture can be quantiﬁed by measuring the displacement of the center of pressure under the feet of a quiet
standing person, leading to time-varying trajectories Fig. 1. It is known in posturography that in case of damages
of one component of the balance system certain characteristic frequency bands will change their relative weights,
see e.g. [6]. Frequency bands provide a crude indicative of typical functional aberrations in the visual, vestibular,
somatosensory and central nervous system. The visual system is linked to frequencies in the range of 0-0.1 Hz
which dominate normal steady and undisturbed posture. Vestibular stress and disturbances will lead to enhanced
frequencies in the 0.1-0.5 Hz band; frequencies between 0.5 and 1 Hz indicate somatosensory activity and postural
reﬂexes mediated by the lower extremities. Finally, signs for malfunctions in the central nervous system usually
correlate to high frequencies, i.e. 1 Hz and higher [6,7].

In this paper we provide ﬁrst evidence that the diﬀerent control mechanisms, at work at their characteristic time
scales, lead to diﬀerent scaling behavior in the center of pressure trajectories. By using a novel sensitive scaling
measure based on wavelet statistics, we not only show that quiet standing is a correlated noise which has been
observed before [8,9] but that in normal posture the mode of the control mechanism at work, is directly related to
one of the multiple scaling regions with their characteristic scaling exponents. Scaling is found to be close to perfect
(one single scaling exponent) in the case where visual and tactile senses are excluded, and the vestibular system plays
the dominant role. This diﬀerence in scaling behavior could be used to directly quantify the relative importance of
the vestibular system in relation to the entire human balance system. The wavelet measure is able to capture this
scaling diﬀerences from standard posturography data on an individual basis. This suggests that the measure could
be of clinical use in diagnostic of the functional quality of the diﬀerent control mechanisms of human posture.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. II we review the concept of scaling statistics and conventional methods for
its quantitative treatment. We further discuss a novel wavelet-variance function method. In Sect. III the experimental
setup and the way of data acquisition are described. Results and a comparison of the diﬀerent methods are presented
in Sect. IV. Section V concludes with a discussion of the ﬁndings and their potential clinical usefulness.

II. METHODS

To completely characterize processes from a stochastic point of view, the knowledge of all possible joint probabilities
of the various events occurring in these processes is necessary. Fractal stochastic processes exhibit scaling in their
statistics, which naturally lead to power-law behavior. Consider a statistic f which depends continuously on the scale
x over which measurements are taken. Suppose the scale gets changed by a factor a and induces the statistics to get
scaled by another factor g(a), related to the factor but independent of the original scale:

The only nontrivial solution to this scaling equation for real valued functions and arguments is

f (x) = bg(x) with g(x) = xc ,

f (ax) = g(a)f (x) .

(1)

(2)

for some constants b and c, e.g. [10,11]. The particular case of a ﬁxed a admits a more general solution, g(x; a) =
xc cos[2πln(x)/ln(a)] [12].

A. Scaling Measures

Over the years there have been developed a vast number of statistics to characterize stochastic processes, some which
have already been applied to human posturography data. Maybe the most direct approach to quantify scaling is to
use two-point correlation functions of the underlying (continuous or discrete) process x(t) (variance of τ -increments):

K(τ ) = h[x(t + τ ) − x(t)]2it

(3)

where h.it denotes the average over t. For processes of the kind of fractional Brownian motion the correlation K(τ )
scales as K(τ ) ∼ τ 2C . For C = 1/2 the diﬀusion result is obtained (Brownian motion). This measure has been
used recently to show that the dynamical process of quiet standing contains long term correlations, and thus can be
interpreted as a correlated noise [13,8,9].

Another method frequently used to quantify scaling behavior of time series is to analyze the corresponding (discrete)

Fourier spectra,

˜X(ω) = |

N

Xk=1

x(k)ei2π(ω−1)(n−1)/N |2 ∝ ωS ,

(4)

to determine the Fourier-scaling exponent S. Fourier analysis strongly depends on the stationarity of the underlying
signals, which is often not the case for real world data. In particular posturography data contains drifts originating
from slow correctional movements. It is common practice in time series analysis to apply Fourier methods after some
sort of ‘detrending’ of the signals.

In the course of improving correlation measures, factors like the Fano and Allan factor have been proposed and
applied widely for stochastic point processes [10]. Those factors are not necessarily limited to point processes, and
can be used to obtain statistical information of time series. For an overview, especially for the relations of these
factors to the power-spectral density, see [11]. The basic idea behind those and related measures is to compare sets of
aggregated (over some time interval) events, rather than just looking at increment statistics as in the case of two-point
correlation functions. As a further generalization of this the concept, the wavelet-variance function (WVF) has been
introduced [2,3].

B. Wavelet-variance function

Multiresolution wavelet analysis [14–18] has proved to be a mathematically clear and practical tool for analyzing
signals at multiple scales, even in the presence of nonstationarities [19,20], which are obviously present in the center
of pressure time series x and y, Fig. 1b. It was shown that wavelet statistics can be used to reveal scaling phenomena
in natural systems in a more transparent way [2,21,3] than other methods frequently used.

In a ﬁrst step we transform our time series into a (two dimensional) space of wavelet coeﬃcients. Technically the

coeﬃcients are obtained by carrying out the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [14] of x:

2

m,n (x) = 2−m/2Z ∞
W wav

−∞

x(t)ψ(2−mt − n)dt ,

(5)

(same for y) where the scale variable m and the translation variable n are integers. The discrete wavelet transform is
evaluated at the points (m, n) in the scale–interval-number plane. Smaller scales correspond to more rapid variations
and therefore to higher frequencies.

We have carried out this transformation using a broad range of orthonormal, compactly supported analyzing
wavelets. Throughout the paper we present results for the Daubechies 10-tap wavelet. Similar results were obtained
using Mallat and Haar wavelets. Orthogonality in the DWT provides that the information represented at a certain scale
m is disjoint from the information at other scales. Because certain wavelets ψ have vanishing moments, polynomial
trends in the signal are automatically eliminated in the process of wavelet transformation [18,20,19]. This is salutatory
in the case of the time series x and y, as is evident from the trends apparent in Fig. 1b. Since the signal x(t) ﬂuctuates
−∞ ψ(t) dt = 0.
In [2] it was suggested to investigate the scaling behavior of the statistics of the wavelet coeﬃcients at a particular

in time, so too does the sequence of wavelet coeﬃcients at any given scale, though its mean is zero since R ∞

scale of the signal of interest, resulting in the wavelet-variance function

σ2
wav(m) =

1

N − 1

N

Xn=1

(W wav

m,n (x) − hW wav

m,n (x)in)2 ∝ m2∆ ,

(6)

where N is the number of wavelet coeﬃcients at a given scale m (N = M/2m, with M being the total number of
sample points in the signal). hW wav
m,n (x)in denotes the mean taken at a given scale. For reasonably long signals this
quantity will be close to zero and can be neglected for practical purposes.

It is not straight forward to relate the wavelet-variance scaling exponent ∆ to the Fourier-scaling coeﬃcient S.
The exponent ∆ may to some extend depend on the choice of the type of wavelets. However, the Allan factor when
multiplied by the mean, can be seen as a special case of the WVF if the Haar wavelet is taken, and a relation to the
Fourier-scaling exponent can be established [11]. Later in this work we present an empirical relation based on fractal
Gaussian noise (FGN) surrogate data and on the Daubechies 10-tap wavelets.

III. DATA AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

For measuring the movements of an upright standing person, the person was placed on a standard posturography
plate [22], which is sensitive to weight shifts. Data was gathered on 37 healthy subjects (Age: 31.7 ± 6.8 years, Weight:
66.3 ± 12.2 kg, Height: 173.0 ± 8.9 cm, Sex: 19 females, 18 males), who had no history of dizziness, have never suﬀered
any leg injuries, nor were taking any form of medication before the measurements. The sample contains no subject
with musculo-skeletal, neurologic or vestibular disorder. The measurements were taken with the subjects looking in
the forward direction, wearing no shoes and no long pants or skirts, to avoid tactile feedback loops along the legs.
Individual tests lasted for 20 seconds as is a typical clinical posturography standard, points were sampled at a rate
of 50 Hz. The reason for keeping the measurements short is to reduce the probability that the subject would change
its standing strategy (toe or hip strategy) within a single measurement. Each subject was measured three times to
ensure consistency.

The output of the plate is the trajectory of the center of gravity projected onto the xy plane, Fig. 1a. The actual
measured x and y trajectories have been shifted by their mean, x = xmeasured − hxmeasuredit (same for y). For the
complete knowledge of a dynamical system the time series of the momenta are also needed. We obtain an estimate
of these by taking time derivatives (ﬁrst diﬀerences) of the x and y trajectories and denote them by vx = d
dt x and
vy = d
dt y, respectively, Fig. 1c. All further analysis has been carried out on these position and ‘velocity’ trajectories.
Figure 1d shows the phase-space plot of the y-component for the same data.

To estimate systematic measurement errors, we placed a mass of 75 kg on the platform. The resulting trajectories,
which relate to vibrations of the ﬂoor and the measuring equipment, were conﬁned to elongations of less than 0.02
cm.

A. Experiments

To be able to study diﬀerent modes of posture control we performed four types of measurements. In the ﬁrst type
the subject was asked to stand still with eyes open (eo). The resulting movements are the bodily responses to a
mixture of visual, somatosensory and vestibular input.

3

In the second test the subjects were asked to close their eyes (ec), and were additionally provided darkened swimming

glasses, so that no visual input could inﬂuence posture control.

The third and fourth test were done on a foot plate that could sway in the forward-backward (y) direction. We
refer to this as the eyes-open–moving plate (eomp) and the eyes-closed–moving plate (ecmp) tests. The experimental
design of these tests was to reduce somatosensoric eﬀects originating in pressure sensors of the foot. Note that in this
setup the pressure on toes and heel is kept constant during the measurement due to the moving plate: Whenever
force is applied by the toes the plate moves down in the front, as it will move down in the back whenever force is
exerted by the heel. While in the eomp test, visual and vestibular systems are active, the resulting movements in the
y-direction in the ecmp test will be dominated by the vestibular system alone.

IV. RESULTS

In order to relate the wavelet-scaling exponent ∆ to the more familiar Fourier-scaling exponent S, we generated
fractal Gaussian noise (FGN) time series, of deﬁnite Fourier-scaling exponent αtheory. From those time series we
computed the Fourier- scaling exponent S, which should be the same as αtheory, and the wavelet-scaling exponent ∆.
The results for the Daubechies 10-tap wavelets are given in Tab. I. A linear ﬁt yields an estimate of the relation of
the two scaling measures:

∆ = −(0.019 + 0.311 S) ∼ −S/3 .

(7)

For each αtheory we generated 50 FGN time series, and averaged over the extracted exponents.

Figures 2a and 2b show σwav(x) and σwav(y) as a function of scale m for the eo and ecmp tests of a representative
subject. Time scales m correspond to data segments of a length of 2m
50 seconds 1. It is seen that for the eo-case the
curve is a straight line from scale two on. For the small scales, the slope - the wavelet-scaling exponent - denoted by
∆S(x) (scale 1 to 2), is clearly less than the slopes at larger scales ∆L(x), indicating the onset of white noise 2 in the
high frequency region, i.e. the small scale region. For the ecmp situation, no such scaling violation is observed, and
∆S ∼ ∆L. We have checked that this ﬁnding is independent of whether discrete or continuous wavelets are used, and
that it is reasonable to extract the scaling exponent ∆S from the smallest 2 scales only in the discrete case. For very
large (VL) scales (m = 6 − 10) we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant decrease in the corresponding scaling exponent ∆V L compared
to ∆S and ∆L. However at those large scales for our relatively short data sets (M = 1000) statistics becomes sparse
and the estimates for σ2

wav(m > 5) rather unreliable.

These observations lead us to consider an index quantifying the degree of scaling violation, determined by the
quotient of the wavelet-scaling exponents in large (∆L) and small (∆S) scale regions: ∆sv = ∆L/∆S. In Fig. 3a
the mean values over the whole sample are shown for all of the measurements (37 subjects `a 3 times). It is clearly
observable that the scaling violation measure ∆sv approaches 1 when suppressing visual and tactile control (ecmp), and
that it nicely distinguishes between the modes of posture control. In Fig. 4a we present ∆sv(y) for all subjects for the
eo and ecmp-tests. The reduction of ∆sv from the eo-case to the ecmp-case is apparent. This eﬀect is less pronounced
in the x-direction in which the plate is stable. The scatter plot in the velocity-scaling–position-scaling-violation plane
also suggests a slight positive correlation of velocity-scaling with the index of scaling violation.

We found that the two-point correlation function used on the same data set shows scaling diﬀerences similar to
those reported in [8,9], but that it is not sensitive enough to clearly distinguish between diﬀerent modes of posture
control. For comparison we show the quotient of the corresponding high (CHigh) and low (CLow) scaling regions
CHigh/CLow(y) in Fig. 3b for the same measurements. We were able to reproduce within errors the two-point
correlation scaling values in the high and medium frequency domain of [8]. Our results are CLow(y)eo = 0.71 ± 0.07,
and CHigh(y)eo = 0.20 ± 0.19. Also the critical time where the scaling regimes of C change could be conﬁrmed to
be somewhat less than a second, which corresponds to the change of wavelet-scaling regimes ∆L(y)eo = 0.85 ± 0.1
to ∆V L(y)eo = 0.25 ± 0.27 at scale m = 6 (1.28 sec), see Tab. II. As for the quotient CHigh/CLow also ∆V L/∆L is
found to be not well suited for a separation of the standing modes, especially not on an individual basis. Note here

1The smallest reasonable scale for the given sampling rate of 50 Hz is thus m = 1 or 1/25 sec. The reason why we did not
consider smaller scales is most clearly seen for the (discrete) Haar wavelet: at scale m = 1, only two sample points will be in
the support of the wavelet. At a smaller time scale (m = 0), σ2
2a slope of zero is equivalent to white noise

wav(0) would be identical to the variance of the signal.

4

that the wavelet-scaling regimes from ∆S to ∆L, which are sensitive to posture control, change at scales m = 2 and
3, corresponding to about 1/10th of a second.

Our standard deviation of CHigh(y) is considerably larger than reported in [8], which is explained by the fact that
the data length there is 4.5 times larger (90 sec) than the data used here. For our relatively short data segments
it was not possible to reliably estimate the third scaling region for time scales larger than 10 seconds for all of the
described methods. In this region scaling vanishes due to the limited extend of motion [9].

Values for the various scaling exponents and the scaling violation quotients are gathered in Tab. II together with the
kurtosis and skewness of the increment processes v(y). The latter indicate almost Gaussian distributions for the steady
plate case which changes clearly towards leptocurtic distributions in the moving-plate scenario. The leptocurticity
reﬂects the existence of periods of fast correctional movements followed by periods of relatively quiet standing in the
moving plate scenarios. In ﬁnancial time series analysis this behavior in dynamics is referred to as volatility clustering.
We continue by analyzing scaling behavior of the increment (‘velocity’) processes. In Figs. 2c and 2d, σwav(vx)
and σwav(vy) demonstrate that in the eo-case the wavelet-scaling exponents are generally small for the corresponding
velocities, which means little correlation or structure. For the ecmp-case the wavelet exponent associated to vy,
∆L(vy), is drastically enhanced, while σwav(vx) is compatible with the eo-case, as expected. This behavior was
encountered in all subjects of the sample of 37 healthy test persons, as can be inferred from Fig. 4a.

To compare the wavelet-variance method to conventional Fourier methods, we extracted Fourier-scaling exponents S
from the data. Since the original signals x and y are nonstationary, doubts on the reliability on a straight forward use
of power spectra are justiﬁed. However, already naive Fourier spectra, after windowing, show typical 1/f behavior and
it is possible to observe diﬀerent scaling exponents in most subjects in the low (SLow(y)) and high frequency regions
(SHigh(y)). The data does not allow for a stable estimate of the degree of the corresponding scaling violation, since
the inter- and intra-subject variance are high, which is reﬂected in the large standard deviations in the corresponding
scaling violation quotient SLow(y)/SHigh(y) in Tab. II. The Fourier-scaling exponents for SLow(y) and SHigh(y) were
obtained from ﬁts in the power spectrum in the region of 1.45 Hz - 12.45 Hz and 12.45 Hz - 25 Hz respectively. We
note here that within errors the relation given in eq. (7) still holds approximately for the experimental data ∆S vs.
SHigh and ∆L vs. SLow (large scales correspond to low frequencies). This could be a sign that the two diﬀerent
scaling regions could be successfully modeled with FGN models. However since errors are large for the estimates of
SHigh and SLow, one should be careful in interpreting this result in terms of the nature of the underlying processes
at the diﬀerent scaling regions.

No problem with nonstationarity will arise when the derivatives vx and vy are used, and clearly 1/f behavior is
observed. The corresponding Fourier-scaling exponents S(vy) for the individual subjects for two tests are gathered in
Fig. 4b. It is clearly seen that the two tests separate in this variable, S drops by a factor of 3 on average. In both
tests a slight decrease of the scaling exponent on age is observable.

We have computed cross correlation functions of x, y, vx and vy components. We could not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
dependence of one on the other for all measurements, and could such exclude torque eﬀects in quiet standing in
healthy subjects.

Additionally we have computed the boxcounting dimension Dbc of the graphs in Fig. 1a for all subjects. The
largest box was taken to be 6 × 6 cm for all measurements. The results are given in Fig. 4c. It is remarkable that
in this variable, which is a measure of the static geometry of the posture trajectory, separation of the diﬀerent tests
occurs, Tab. II.

V. DISCUSSION

All the conventional scaling measures used in this work were able to conﬁrm that human posture is indeed a
correlated process, and indicate that diﬀerent scaling regions are present (multifractal). The wavelet-variance function
method proves to exhibit these scaling violations in a very precise way so that it becomes possible to relate the diﬀerent
control mechanisms to diﬀerent scaling exponents on an individual basis. We show that this is even possible on very
short (standard) posturography data, clearly outperforming the other methods.

In particular we demonstrated that dominance of the vestibular system shows close to perfect scaling phenomena in
the position time series. When visual and tactile input information are superimposed on the vestibular system, scaling
violations occur, pointing of course at a nonlinear interplay of the underlying systems and their relevant characteristic
time scales. For the ‘velocity’ time series the eﬀect is even more pronounced since the pure vestibular system shows
clear scaling, which breaks down almost completely for the superposition cases.

The ﬁndings presented here might bear a potential for practical use: since the scaling exponents and scaling violation
measures can be considered as tools which measure the relative importance of the vestibular system in comparison

5

with the visual and somatosensory systems, it seems sensible that they provide a key for a direct measurement of
the intactness of the vestibular system. Clinical practice today is to measure this intactness of the vestibular system
by thermally disturbing it and measuring the resulting eye movements. A particular interesting subject will be an
analysis, along the lines presented here, of sway data of patients with dizziness, which often goes hand in hand with
vestibular stress or malfunction.

We found ﬁrst evidence that some scaling measures are age dependent. It might be possible to quantitatively relate

a loss of complexity in the posture control systems of the aging human to changes in scaling measures.

TABLE II. Various scaling measures and kurtosis and skewness of the increment processes for the four diﬀerent tests
performed (eyes open (eo), eyes closed (ec), eyes-open–moving plate (eomp) and eyes-closed–moving plate (ecmp)). The value
in bracket is the standard deviation over all measurements (3 per subject). Fits for S(y) and S(d/dt y) have been taken over
the whole frequency range.

FIG. 1. Movement of the center of gravity projected on the xy-plane (a) for open eyes, stable plate. The time evolution of the
motion for the x and y components is shown in (b). The time derivatives represent momentary ‘velocity’ (c). Whereas positions
are clearly nonstationary for the 20 seconds time intervals, velocities are. (d) Phase-space diagram for the y-component. The
form of the phase-space trajectory reminds on the Duﬃng oscillator with randomized phases. For clarity the plot has been
smoothed by moving averages of block-size 4.

FIG. 2. Wavelet scaling exponents for the eyes open (eo), (left column) and the eyes-closed–moving plate (ecmp), (right)
test. For the position data x and y (top line) scaling violation in eo is obvious for low scales. This violation is absent in ecmp.
In the velocity data vx and vy scaling is generally low in eo, but becomes strong in the y component of ecmp.

FIG. 3. Comparison of the wavelet-scaling-invariance ∆L/∆S(y) measure (a) and the corresponding correlation quotient
CHigh/CLow(y) (b). In the latter there is no diﬀerence detectable in the mode of posture control. eo, ec, eomp and ecmp
refrere to the eyes open, eyes closed, eyes-open–moving plate and eyes-closed–moving plate tests respectively. The errorbars
indicate mean standard errors.

FIG. 4. Scaling measures for the whole sample of 37 healthy persons. (a) velocity-scaling–position-scaling-violation plot.
The scaling-violation measure ∆L/∆S(y) is grouped around one for the eyes-closed–moving (ecmp) case, while it is larger for
the eyes open test (eo). The wavelet-scaling exponent in vy is signiﬁcantly larger for the ecmp than for eo. Moreover a slight
positive correlation of velocity-scaling with position-scaling-violation is observable. (b) Fourier-scaling exponents for velocities
for all individuals ordered by age (left - young, right - old). (d) Box counting dimension Dbc for the same individuals. The
symbols denote the means of the three identical measurements, the errorbars are the corresponding mean standard errors.

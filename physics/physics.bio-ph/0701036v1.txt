Abstract

We present in this paper an original approach to compute the
electrophoretic mobility of rigid nucleo-protein complexes like nucle-
osomes. This model allows to address theoretically the inﬂuence of
complex position along DNA, as well as wrapped length of DNA on the
electrophoretic mobility of the complex. The predictions of the model
are in qualitative agreement with experimental results on mononucleo-
somes assembled on short DNA fragments (< 400bp). Inﬂuence of ad-
ditional experimental parameters like gel concentration, ionic strength,
eﬀective charges is also discussed in the framework of the model, and
is found to be qualitatively consistent with experiments when avail-
able. Based on the present model, we propose a simple semi-empirical
formula describing positioning of nucleosomes as seen through elec-
trophoresis.

Introduction

Electrophoresis is one of the most powerful and widely used tech-
nique in modern molecular biology in order to address various prop-
erties of biological samples: molecular weight and size determination
(DNA, proteins ...), mapping of particular protein binding sites on
DNA (enzyme footprinting), eﬀective charges (protein charge ladders)
(1).
In most applications aforementioned, there is a need of some
a calibrated sample, the so-called “ladder”, in order to quantify the
results of any electrophoresis experiments. This allows to use these
techniques without the precise knowledge of physical mechanisms un-
derlying electrophoresis separation. Nevertheless, by processing this
way, one misses additional informations that are not brought by the
comparison with the ladder. This is the case for example for nucleo-
protein complexes like mononucleosomes. The nucleosome is the ﬁrst
degree of organization of DNA within the chromatin of eukaryotes. It
is made from the complexation of roughly 147 bp of DNA with an
octamer of histone proteins (2). It has been shown indirectly that elec-
trophoretic mobility of mononucleosomes depends on its positioning
along DNA (3). Now this property is widely used to detect qualita-
tively nucleosome repositioning due either to thermal ﬂuctuations or
to the action of remodeling factors (4, 5). But taken alone, these kind
of experiments do just indicate that a change occured either on the
conformation of nucleosome, and/or on its charge distribution, since
electrophoresis of colloidal particles is mostly sensitive to these two
intrinsic properties. No quantitative conclusions can be reached with
respect to the precise position of nucleosome along DNA. Physical mod-
eling of electrophoresis might help extracting this information from the
experiments.

In the early works of Pennings and collaborators about position-
dependent electrophoretic mobility of nucleosomes (3), datas were in-
terpreted using similar results obtained on short bent oligonucleotides
(6, 7): the mobility of such molecules in a gel is strongly dependent
on both position and angle of the bent, with same qualitative trends.
Apart from the similarity of experimental results, the systems are not
expected to behave exactly the same, due to the large size of the nu-
cleosome core, roughly 10 nm in diameter, which is not present in
the bent oligonucleotides experiments. But it is quite likely that po-
sition selectivity arises from the same physical mechanisms, still to
be discovered. On the theoretical side, reptation models have been
shown to explain qualitatively some features about bent-DNA but the
position-dependent mobility cannot be obtained in a quantitative way
(7, 8). Again, the large size of the nucleosome core renders the rep-
tation mechanism diﬃcult to apply in our case, at least for explaining
this position-dependence of mobility. Therefore there is a real speciﬁty

Nucleosome electrophoresis

of large DNA-protein complexes with respect to their mobility in pure
solution or in gels, as compared to naked bent-DNA. In the present
study, we will focus on the nucleosomal case. The methods developped
in this context are currently applied to analyze position-dependent
mobility of bent DNA in a separate study (9).

Precise computation and description of electrophoretic mobility is
a formidable task as soon as non-trivial geometries are considered.
Indeed one need to solve simultaneously equations describing electro-
static potential, ﬂow proﬁle and ionic species distribution (10). More-
over, any realistic model should take into account the eﬀect of siev-
ing medium in which electric migration is performed. We propose in
this work a general method to evaluate electrophoretic mobility of a
rigid nucleo-protein complex in pure buﬀer or in gels through eﬀective
continuous electro-hydrodynamic description: mimicking the confor-
mation of nucleosome by a set of charged beads of appropriate size
and charge, we calculate total electrophoretic mobility similarly to the
way friction coeﬃcients of proteins are evaluated using beads models
mapping the protein conformation (11, 12). This approach has been
already applied to study theoretically the inﬂuence of diﬀerent charge
distribution on the electrophoretic mobility of polyampholytes (13).
Moreover, it will be shown that in order to reproduce quantitatively
the experimental results speciﬁc gel features will have also to be taken
into account in the model. Taking all these theoretical ingredients
together allows then to investigate the inﬂuence of diﬀerent physical
factors like gel concentration, buﬀer ionic strength, bead-complex con-
formation on the electrophoretic mobility.

In order to illustrate the beneﬁts of such an approach, we address
two original questions in the context of mononucleosomes characteriza-
tion: (i) is the position-dependent electrophoretic mobility to be seen
in pure buﬀer, without any sieving medium, corresponding to the case
of capillary electrophoresis, and (ii) what is the inﬂuence of nucleosome
geometry like the amount of DNA length wrapped around the histone
core within the nucleosome on its electrophoretic mobility? The ﬁrst
question allows to address the role of the gel in position-dependent
mobility.
In the context of the second question, the non-canonical
conformations of a mononucleosome are supposed to mimick diﬀerent
incomplete states of nucleosomes. As an example, it is known that
the four diﬀerent histones (H2A,H2B,H3,H4) found in canonical nu-
cleosomes are arranged into an octamer. Two diﬀerent type of partial
association of histones leading to DNA-histones complexes can also be
found in solution: H3-H4 tetramers, and hexamers made of one H3-H4
tetramer and one H2A-H2B dimer. These are characterized by diﬀer-
ent amount of DNA wrapped around the protein core. Experimentally,
they have diﬀerent electrophoretic mobilities. Another recent example
of interest is the case of nucleosomes made of histone variants, which

Nucleosome electrophoresis

are found in the chromatin at some speciﬁc locations along the genome
where a strong regulation of gene expression occurs (either repression
or activation) (14). In the case of the variant H2A.Bbd, it is believed
that DNA wrapped length in the nucleosome variant is of order 120
base pairs instead of the canonical 147 base pairs (15). Within our
model, it is possible to evaluate the diﬀerence in electrophoretic mo-
bility between canonical and variant nucleosomes for the same DNA
length.

The paper is organized as follows.

In the next section, we de-
scribe ﬁrst the general formalism to compute the electrophoretic mo-
bility of a coarse-grained nucleosome model through continuous electro-
hydrodynamics, and then the way to include speciﬁc gel eﬀects in this
model. Numerical results of such models are then presented. Finally
applications and limitations of the present work are discussed.

Model

General formalism

In the present work, we propose a coarse-grained model of a mononu-
cleosome: its shape and total charge are approximated by a rigid set
{i} of non-overlapping charged beads of radii σi and net charges zi,
hereafter denoted as the bead-complex (cf ﬁg. 1 a). The net steady
state motion of such an object under an external electric ﬁeld E in
a buﬀer of ionic strength I and viscosity η is due to the balance be-
tween electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces. The rigidity assumption
amounts to neglect conformation ﬂuctuations of the whole complex
and especially of DNA arms. This is justiﬁed for the latter as long as
the arms are shorter than a persistence length, i.e. the thermal rigidity
length scale, which sets the upper limit of total DNA length (wrapped
length and arms) to roughly 400 base pairs. The neglect of confor-
mation ﬂuctuations of the complex is associated to the tight wrapping
of DNA around nucleosomes. The inﬂuence of bead-complex opening
angle ﬂuctuations is then addressed within our model by computing
the mobility for various rigid conformations.

A naive statement for a rigid object like the bead-complex would
be that the electrostatic forces are purely driving the motion, while
the hydrodynamic forces purely exert drags, just like in any sedimen-
tation or centrifugation experiments. However, it is well-known that
electrostatic forces contribute as well to the net hydrodynamic drag
due to the presence of counterions going in reverse direction of motion
and therefore exerting an additional drag. This is the very presence of
co and counterions that makes the problem of calculating exactly the
full solution of the problem
electrophoretic mobility a tedious task:

Nucleosome electrophoresis

would require to solve simultaneously Poisson equation for the electro-
static potential, Navier-Stokes equation for the ﬂows and ion transport
equation for the spatial distributions of ions (10).

Under certain range of parameters, it is however possible to ob-
tain a simple closed formula by using several assumptions. The ﬁrst
one is that the distributions of co and counterions around the bead-
complex are equilibrium distributions. This amounts to neglect the
so-called ion-relaxation eﬀect which is important mainly for highly
charged objects and high electric ﬁeld (10). The main consequence
of this assumption is that electrostatics is now described by classi-
cal Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The second assumption is that the
Debye-Huckel linear approximation for the electrostatic potential is
valid, i.e. bead-complex is not highly charged. Finally, we assume
that the electric ﬁeld driving the motion of the bead-complex is small
enough such that orientation and polarization eﬀects are negligible.
The validity of these assumptions with respect to realistic systems is
discussed in section Applications and Limitations

Due to the linearity of Navier-Stokes equation at low Reynolds
number as considered in this work, each bead subjected to a force
contributes linearly to the ﬂow ﬁeld at any given point through hy-
drodynamic interactions. Following Long et al. (13), we identify two
diﬀerent types of force on each bead, that generate diﬀerent hydro-
dynamic contributions. The ﬁrst type of force {Fi} is due to the
rigid physical connection between neighbouring beads, and it is still
present when electrostatic interactions are switched oﬀ. The associ-
ated long-range hydrodynamic interaction is accurately described by
Rotne-Prager tensor (16, 17), which is the ﬁrst ﬁnite-volume correction
to Oseen tensor associated to point-like forces

The other type of force acting on each bead is electrostatic through

polyampholyte dynamics (13). However, they were mainly interested
in the inﬂuence of diﬀerent charge distributions for average confor-
mations.
In the present work, the conformation is ﬁxed due to the
assumed rigidity of the bead-complex, and therefore Eq. 9 can directly
and explicitely be used to calculate the electrophoretic mobility. This
has the further advantage to keep track of bead-complex orientation
with respect to the electric ﬁeld ϕ. Results of the numerical calculation
for particular geometries of the bead-complex in the case of mononu-
cleosome are provided and discussed in the next sections.

Speciﬁc gel eﬀects

Up to this point, no eﬀect of sieving medium, i.e. the polymeric gel
(polyacrilamide, agarose...), has been taken into account. In this sec-
tion, we describe three main eﬀects due to the gel, and how they can
be incorporated into the original model: hydrodynamic ﬂow screening,
constrained orientation of bead-complex in the gel and trapping.

Hydrodynamic screening – The ﬁrst eﬀect of the gel on the
migration of bead-complex is to screen hydrodynamic ﬂow (18), as
was originally proposed by Brinkman to describe hydrodynamics in
porous media (24). This eﬀect is straightforwardly incorporated in
the original continuous electro-hydrodynamics. Following Long and
Ajdari (18), tensors describing screened hydrodynamic ﬂow either due
to electrophoretic motion or to neutral migration in a porous medium
are identical. In the latter case, it is given by Rotne-Prager tensor in
Eqs. 3, the Debye screening length being replaced by the gel screening
g = (ξgcg)−1/2, where the gel is represented as a collection
length κ−1
of beads of friction coeﬃcients ξg and concentration cg. With this
modiﬁcation of long-ranged Rotne-Prager tensor into a short-range
one, the electrophoretic mobility of the bead complex in a gel can be
calculated according to Eq 9.

Orientation – The second important eﬀect of the gel is to constrain
the orientation of the bead-complex during its migration, see ﬁgure
1b. Indeed for an anisotropic object like a mononucleosome with ﬁnite
length DNA arms, the migration is enhanced if the size of the complex
in the direction perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld is smaller than gel
pore size, while it is strongly reduced in the reverse situation. Using
the continuous electro-hydrodynamic model presented in the previous
section, this eﬀect can be taken into account by constraining the range
of orientation angle while performing the orientation average. This will
be discussed more precisely in the next section.

Trapping – Finally, the migration of nucleosomes within a gel is
strongly inﬂuenced by trapping events: since there is a ﬁnite bending
angle between DNA arms leaving the core of the nucleosome, this bent
or kink might be trapped transiently through a collision with gel ﬁbers

Nucleosome electrophoresis

(cf ﬁg.
1 c), just like long naked DNAs are known to hook in U-
shape around gel ﬁbers for high electric ﬁelds electrophoresis (25). The
untrapping process in the case of naked DNA is thought to occur like
a rope on a pulley.
In the present case of rigid bead-complex, the
escape from trapped conﬁguration is mainly achieved by rigid rotation
around the gel ﬁber. The overall average motion of the complex is then
described by alternation of two states: (i) a uniform steady motion in
the free volume of the gel with a pure buﬀer velocity v, corrected by the
hydrodynamic screening eﬀect of the gel previously mentioned, during
an average time τf ree, and (ii) trapping/untrapping event of vanishing
net velocity, during an average time τtrap. As a result, the average
velocity V in the direction of the electric ﬁeld is given by

Similar formula has been used to describe the motion of long naked
DNA in gel when trapping events are mainly determining the overall
dynamics (26, 27).

The average time during free motion is estimated by the mean-free
path of the bead-complex lMF P ∼ 1/(πd2cg), with d the diameter of
gel ﬁber and cg its concentration. Therefore the estimate of τf ree is

Although collision scenario is not precisely known during trapping
events, one might anticipate that the longest time (which is the rele-
vant time for the mobility calculation) is associated with the rotation
of the complex around gel ﬁbers. This motion is driven by the electro-
static torque Γel(ϕ), which depends on relative orientation ϕ between
complex and electric ﬁeld. Introducing the rotation friction coeﬃcient
ξR of bead-complex, the time required to escape the trap scales as

where angles ϕ1 and ϕ2 are respectively the orientation of complex
at the beginning and the end of trapping event, cf ﬁgure 1c. It will
be checked in the next section that the precise choice of these angles
is not that crucial to obtain qualitative informations. Moreover, the
estimation of free and trapping average time presented here are suﬃ-
cient to address the questions of position- and geometry- dependence of
electrophoretic mobility mentioned in the introduction. Precise formu-
lation of trapping events is beyond the scope of this work. Simulation
works with model gels (cubic arrangement of ﬁbers) might help to
unravel the details of such collision events (28).

Results and discussion

Migration in pure buﬀer

The application of Eq. 9 for the standard geometry and conditions as
deﬁned in Appendix B is shown in ﬁgure 2. For a given position of the
bead-complex, i.e. a given length for one of the arms, the mobility os-
cillates as function of the relative orientation of electric ﬁeld and bead-
complex. This mainly reﬂects the anisotropy of bead-complex friction
coeﬃcient (datas not shown). As it is clearly demonstrated in ﬁgure
2, two diﬀerent positions of bead-complex (x = 1 end-position and
x = 9 middle-position) are associated with diﬀerent angular average
mobilities and oscillation amplitudes. A striking result is that in pure
buﬀer, we predict slightly larger average mobility for middle-position
than end-position bead-complex. Checking for both the electrophoresis
and nucleosome litterature, we did not ﬁnd any experimental study of
capillary electrophoresis of positioned mononucleosomes, and therefore
this simple prediction has not being addressed yet.

This result in pure buﬀer has to be contrasted with the well-known
experimental results obtained many times in gel, which show precisely
the opposite: end-position nucleosomes are faster than middle-position
ones during native gel electrophoresis. This discrepancy comes from
the direct inﬂuence of the gel on the migration process: the porous
structure of the gel provides an orientation constraint such that optimal
orientation during the migration is favored rather than uniform angular
average. As a consequence, our model predicts under such conditions
that end-position nucleosomes move faster than middle-position ones in
agreement with the experiments (cf thick dashed lines in ﬁgure 2). For
interpolating positions of the nucleosome, the electrophoretic mobility
changes gradually between the extreme positions. Notice that higher
values of electric ﬁeld might lead to orientation as well, due to the
alignment of net dipole of the nucleosomes with electric ﬁeld. The
amplitude of positioning eﬀect on the mobility is shown in the inset of
ﬁgure 2. For the sake of simplicity, we chosed the optimal orientation of
nucleosomes for computing the positioning curve of mobility, therefore
neglecting ﬂuctuations around this optimal orientation. The precise
non-uniform distribution of orientations might be quite sensitive to
the gel model. A qualitative comparison of the amplitude computed
with optimal orientation with respect to experimental amplitude under
similar conditions shows that the predicted amplitude of positioning
eﬀect is much weaker. Indeed ratio between middle-position and end-
position mobility can be as small as 0.4 for particular conditions (see
In the next subsections, we
ﬁgure 5 below for longer DNA) (29).
vary diﬀerent parameters of the model in order to scan the range of
accessible amplitudes, and check whether the continuous model is able

Nucleosome electrophoresis

10

to reproduce the experimental range somehow.

Range of model parameters

There are at least three parameters in the model than can be tuned
in order to match experimental conditions: the hydrodynamic screen-
ing lengths due respectively to gel and ionic buﬀer, and the eﬀective
charge of nucleosome core. For all the results presented in this section,
optimal orientation of nucleosomes during migration has been chosen
in order to calculate the electrophoretic mobility. The hydrodynamic
screening due to the gel depends mainly on gel concentration for a ﬁxed
composition. As it is seen in ﬁgure 3, the screening length has barely
no inﬂuence for sizes larger than the bead-complex itself. For smaller
screening length, the positioning eﬀect is reduced. This comes from
the fact that as the range of hydrodynamic interactions decreases, the
inﬂuence of position on the electrophoretic mobility decreases as well:
for asymptotically very short range hydrodynamic interactions (of or-
der of DNA bead size), the hydrodynamic inﬂuence of bead-complex
arms on the core is roughly the same whathever the respective length
of the arms. Notice that under standard conditions deﬁned in the Ap-
pendix B, short range electrostatic screening is always present. The
results of Pennings et al. (30) can be precisely interpreted as the eﬀect
of hydrodynamic screening: they observed that the positioning eﬀect
is lost when migration is performed in glycerol, therefore when the
hydrodynamic screening is increased (without trapping).

Coming back to the situation of no hydrodynamic screening due to
the gel, it is possible to observe the inﬂuence of electrostatic screening
alone on the electrophoretic mobility. As it is demonstrated in ﬁg-
ure 3, the positioning eﬀect increases strongly as the ionic strength
of the buﬀer is increased or equivalently as the Debye screening length
is decreased. Note that the conformation of the nucleosome was arti-
ﬁcially kept ﬁxed under ionic strength variation, in order to address
speciﬁcally the dynamic role of salt ions. The subtle interplay between
electrostatics and hydrodynamics provide therefore a way of modulat-
ing the amplitude of positioning eﬀect in pure buﬀer.

Finally, the eﬀective net charge of the core can also be considered
as an adjustable parameter: it is diﬃcult to assign such a value purely
from theoretical considerations, because this net charge depends on
many intricated features like the state of charge of the protein octamer,
the ionic strength of buﬀer and the possible counterion condensation.
What is precisely known from experiments is that the net charge of the
nucleosome core is negative, the DNA overcharging the basic charge
of the protein octamer. Increasing the net charge of the nucleosome
core reduces the positioning eﬀect, as can be seen from ﬁgure 3.This
reﬂects the role of the core as the main driving force for migration, the

Nucleosome electrophoresis

11

diﬀerence in friction contribution between middle-position and end-
position becoming less important as the net charge is increased.

A partial conclusion drawn from this scan of model parameters is
that continuous electro-hydrodynamic model is able to describe the
positioning eﬀect on the electrophoretic mobility in a qualitative way,
but not in a quantitative way. As it will be shown in section , trapping
events are more likely to be responsible for the experimentally observed
amplitude of the positioning eﬀect.

Bead-complex opening

Still working within the framework of continuous electro-hydrodynamic
model, it is possible to investigate the inﬂuence of bead-complex ge-
ometry on the electrophoretic mobility. In particular, we vary in this
section the opening angle of the bead-complex, i.e. the amount of DNA
wrapped in the nucleosome core, mimicking diﬀerent nucleosome con-
formations either due to incomplete formation of the histone octamer
or to the presence of histone variants.

During the numerical calculation, we take into account the fact that
a reduced DNA complexed length within the nucleosome reduces ef-
fectively its core net charge. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that
the net charge of nucleosome core scales linearly with the complexed
length of DNA. The results are presented in ﬁgure 4 for diﬀerent open-
ing angles θ as function of bead-complex orientation with respect to
the electric ﬁeld for middle-position nucleosomes. The discrete values
of θ were chosen such that the number of beads in the arms is always
an even number. For each opening angle, the mobility oscillates. This
representation highlights the diﬀerent amplitudes and relative phases
of these oscillations. Due to the gradual opening of the nucleosome
as θ increases from 0◦ (two superhelical turn of DNA) to 360◦ (one
superhelical turn of DNA), the optimal orientation during migration,
as imposed by the gel, switches between two values (90◦ and 0◦). The
net result for the predicted mobility at optimal orientation is shown in
the inset of ﬁgure 4: the mobility ﬁrst decreases as function of opening
angle, and increases slightly for θ ≃ 360◦.

These results only indicate qualitative trends for the opening angle
inﬂuence for two reasons: the ﬁrst one is that the variation of nucle-
osome core net charge might be nonlinear with respect to the DNA
wrapped length due to the ion condensation phenomena. The sec-
ond reason is related to histone octamer stabilization by the DNA.
In a solution under physiological conditions made by the four diﬀer-
ent histones, there are mainly two populations: H3-H4 tetramer and
H2A-H2B dimers, but almost no octamer that are not stable with-
out DNA around it. This means that if less DNA is wrapped around
the nucleosome core, one or two H2A-H2B dimers might be lost, and

Nucleosome electrophoresis

12

therefore the net charge of the core might be changed dramatically, as
opposed to the linear variation assumed for the calculation. One way
of addressing these two points is to test for diﬀerent decreasing relation
Zcore vs θ. The result of such additional calculations not shown here
is that the mobility is still a decreasing function of opening angle for
a large range of angles: the observations presented in this subsection
are quite robust with respect to core net charge variation.

Trapping

In this section, we provide a qualitative estimate of electrophoretic
mobility according to the trapping-untrapping scenario proposed in a
previous section about speciﬁc gel eﬀects. A more rigorous geometri-
cal calculation is proposed in Appendix C of this work, by evaluating
the trap escape time due to electrostatic torque. The results of two
approaches are consistent with each others, and therefore are thought
to provide a correct estimate of position-dependent mobility.

As it was previously discussed, the leading order speciﬁc gel eﬀect
inﬂuencing nucleosome migration is the occurence of frequent collisions
with gel ﬁbers. This is described approximately by introduction of two
characteristic times (cf Eq. 10): the free motion time and the trapping
time. The former depends mainly on the gel concentration, while the
latter is closely related to the bead-complex conformation. Within
this context, it is straightforward to interpret the fast migration of
end-position nucleosome as compared to middle-position nucleosomes:
the latter adopt more likely kinked conﬁgurations and their velocity are
therefore strongly reduced through trapping, while the former adopt
“tadpole”-like conﬁgurations and they have smaller probability to be
trapped.

Similarly, diﬀerent opening angle lead to diﬀerent trapping time.
The limiting values are θ = 0 (two superhelical turns) with almost no
trapping due to the absence of kink in the conformation, and θ = π
(1.5 superhelical turn) with high trapping time due to a 180 kink.

In order to make a simple functional prediction for the electrophoretic

mobility, one can expand the trapping time to the second order in nu-
cleosome position or arm length x. Taking into account positioning
symmetry considerations, this time is rewritten

where L is the total length of nucleosome arms and A(θ) depends

through variable θ. In the previous equation, it is implicitely assumed
that end-position nucleosomes are not trapped at all. As a conse-
quence, we propose the following prediction concerning the position-

dependent electrophoretic mobility in gel of a mononucleosome

µ =

µ0(x)
1 + d2A(θ)µ0(x)

cg

x(L − x)

(14)

where µ0(x) is the mobility in pure buﬀer, as calculated in previous
sections. Since variation of mobility with position in pure buﬀer is
less than 6-7 % whatever the range of realistic parameters tested in
this study, one can use constant µ0 in a ﬁrst approximation in order
to use our prediction to interpret experimental datas. Equation 14
provides therefore a simple semi-empirical formula that is designed to
rationalize experimental datas of position-dependent electrophoretic
mobility. The application of such a formula for constant µ0 to the
experimental datas of Meersseman et al. (29) on mononucleosome po-
sitioning on twofold repeat of 5S rDNA sequence (total length=414bp)
is shown in ﬁgure 5. A reasonable agreement between model and
experimental datas is found. However, the correct interpretation of
the ﬁtting parameter would require additional systematic experimental
datas. Therefore we do not pursue further the analysis of ﬁt parame-
ters. A clear conclusion that can nevertheless be drawn at this level of
analysis is that trapping events are mainly determining the amplitude
of positioning eﬀects, and therefore they cannot be neglected in the
theoretical interpretations of datas.

Applications and limitations

In this work, we presented a model that can be used in order to in-
terpret the position-dependent electrophoretic mobility of mononucle-
osomes. In a ﬁrst step we computed the mobility in pure buﬀer, and
then we took into account speciﬁc eﬀects associated to the migration
in gel. The theory describing the migration in pure buﬀer is based on
continuous electro-hydrodynamic description as applied to a coarse-
grained model of nucleosome made of beads of various radii and net
charges. One of the main simplifying assumption used in order to
derive an explicit expression out of the compact formula Eq. 9 is the
Debye-Huckel approximation that leads to short-ranged Rotne-Prager-
like tensors (cf eq. 3). At ﬁrst sight, it might appear very naive to
apply it for the electrostatic potential around such a highly charged
object like the nucleosome (31). However it allows to hide the eﬀect
of complicated features like counterion condensation in the eﬀective
charges of beads in the coarse-grained model. Moreover, the exponen-
tial decay of electrostatic potential at longer range is also expected
from more rigorous approaches. In the results presented in previous
sections, we used the same eﬀective charge for each DNA-bead. An
improvement of the model would be to take into account for inhomo-
geneous counterion condensation on the DNA-beads forming the arms

Nucleosome electrophoresis

14

and therefore non-uniform DNA-bead charges, since it is known that
electrostatic potential along a ﬁnite size polyelectrolyte is not constant
(32, 33). The order of magnitude of changes of positioning eﬀect on
electrophoretic mobility due to inhomogeneous counterion condensa-
tion is similar to the one obtained by varying the net charge of the
core Zcore (unpublished results).

Our numerical calculations shows that the positioning eﬀect in pure
buﬀer and in gels are opposite and diﬀerent in magnitude: end-position
nucleosomes move faster (compared to middle-position nucleosomes) in
gels, while they are slower in pure buﬀer. This is mainly explained by
the orientation of the nucleosome during gel migration as opposed to
an orientationally-averaged migration during pure buﬀer electrophore-
sis at low electric ﬁeld. However the small amplitude of position-
dependent mobility in pure buﬀer might be diﬃcult to measure ex-
perimentally. A personal interpretation of our results is that capil-
lary electrophoresis, although not used systematically for protein-DNA
complexes characterization, might bring new information on these sys-
tems, because both analytical and numerical hydrodynamic models
used to interpret the datas are becoming more precise and powerful
(see for example (34)).

Using the continuous electro-hydrodynamic model, it is possible to
investigate the inﬂuence of nucleosome geometry on the value of elec-
trophoretic mobility, as it is described in previous section. The main
result is that the mobility of middle-position nucleosome decreases as
the DNA length wrapped in the core is decreasing. Focusing on incom-
plete nucleosome characterization, our model would predict that the
fastest specie in pure buﬀer is the octamer, then the hexamer and ﬁ-
nally the tetramer. Here again the experimental results are diﬀerent in
gels: the fastest are hexamer, then octamer and ﬁnally tetramer. The
mobility of the octamer relative to the other specie is not correctly eval-
uated through the continuous model. This discrepancy can be partially
interpreted as a speciﬁc eﬀect of the gel using the trapping model de-
ﬁned in previous section: although the precise DNA wrapped length of
hexamer (between 1 and 1.5 superhelical turn )and tetramer (roughly
one superhelical turn) is not known, one can speculate that the kink
formed by the two DNA arms is less important than for the octamer
(90◦ kink or 1.75 superhelical turn). Therefore the octamer is more
sensitive to trapping mechanism, and its mobility is further reduced.
As a consequence the octamer will not be the fastest specie anymore in
gel. It can be either the second fastest or the third fastest. The former
situation corresponds to the experimental observation. However at the
level of the present description, we can not discriminate between the
two cases. However, it is clear that the role of core net charge will be
important.

Using the trapping model, we propose a semi-empirical formula

Nucleosome electrophoresis

15

Eq. 14 in order to predict the electrophoretic mobility of positioned
nucleosomes. The application of such a formula to experimental datas
of Meersseman et al. seems a reasonable guess (29). This leads us to
propose the following method in order to determine unknown position-
ing within a single gel run. The idea is that for this single gel run, one
should have in a lane two diﬀerent known positions (middle and end
position for example) on a well-known sequence in order to provide a
ladder. Then the two-parameters formula Eq. 14 (at constant µ0) can
be used to get the unknown positions on another sequence in diﬀerent
lanes, provided that the DNA length on which mononucleosomes are
constructed is the same.

As a conclusion, the main gain of the approach presented in this
work is that it provides a rigorous framework for the understanding
of position-dependent electrophoretic mobility of mononucleosomes.
Moreover, the inﬂuence of diﬀerent experimental parameters can be
qualitatively predicted. This work may serve as a guideline for more
thorough studies of electrophoresis of rigid molecular complexes. We
are currently developping similar models in order to investigate more
thoroughly the dependence of electrophoretic mobility of curved DNA
on bent angle and position (9).

Appendix A: friction coeﬃcients for screened
hydrodynamics

In order to calculate the friction coeﬃcient of a single bead into a ﬂuid,
it is necessary to solve the ﬂow and pressure proﬁle around this particle.
In the case where the hydrodynamics is screened either because of
electrostatic screening or because of the gel, the calculation of the
friction coeﬃcient can still be done analytically. Although the ﬂow
proﬁles are similar in the two situations, the friction coeﬃcient are
diﬀerent due to diﬀerent pressure ﬁeld (18). The reader is referred to
the works of Russel et al. (22) or Stigter (23) for futher details on
the derivation of the friction coeﬃcients. The result goes as follows for
electrostatic screening:

Appendix B: geometry of the bead-complex

In this appendix, we describe the geometry of the complex that mim-
icks electro-hydrodynamics of positioned nucleosome. This complex is
shown in ﬁgure 1. According to structural datas available on mononu-
cleosomes (2), DNA is wrapped on a superhelical path around an oc-
tamer of histones. In the case of positioned nucleosome, DNA arms
entering and exiting the nucleosome core are also present. Their confor-
mations depend mainly on ionic strength of the buﬀer (see for example
(35)). In the present work, we assume for the sake of simplicity that
DNA outside the nucleosome core is following a straight path, whose
direction is given by the tangent path of the last bead in the complex
core . This is justiﬁed by both the rigidity of DNA backbone (per-
sistence length of roughly 150 base pairs) for such small non-wrapped
lengths of nucleosomes considered (< 100bp) and by the physiological
ionic strength that eﬀectively screens electrostatic interactions beyond
1 to a few nanometers.

Due to the level of description of both hydrodynamic and electro-
static interactions in this work, the nucleosome core (histone octamer
and 147 base pairs of DNA) is represented by a single bead with an
eﬀective radius Rcore and eﬀective net charge Zcore. Indeed, we use
Rotne-Prager tensors as well as Debye-Huckel approach for interac-
tions. These expression are correct for large separations, as long as
eﬀective radii and charges are taken into account. Moreover in the case
of electrostatics, subtle eﬀects like net charge of protein and counte-
rion condensation are taken into account by the appropriate choice of
Zcore.

Protruding from the central core bead, DNA arms are represented
by two linear arrays of smaller beads. Due to the natural anisotropy of
a base pairs of radius rbp⊥ = 1nm and height rbp|| = 0.34nm, a single
“DNA” bead embeds several base pairs. For a given number of base
pairs Nbp, the number of beads in the two arms is given by

Nbead =

(Nbp − 147(4π−θ)
(1.75)2π − 1)rbp||
2rbp⊥

+ 1

(17)

It has been implicitely assumed in the previous equation that in the
reference nucleosome 147 base pairs of DNA are exactly wrapped into
1.75 superhelical turns. This formula allows to calculate the number of
beads in the arms for diﬀerent opening angle θ, cf ﬁgure 1. The ﬁrst

Nucleosome electrophoresis

17

bead of each arms is tangent to the central core bead, and is located at
the coordinate of the last base pair of the nucleosome core (base pairs
1 and 147). Similar results are obtained if slightly diﬀerent matching
conditions are used.

The choice of values for the bead-complex eﬀective parameters is
made mainly following values used in related brownian dynamics sim-
ulations by Beard and Schlick (36).
In the main part of this work,
we refer “standard geometry and conditions” to the following set of
parameters

Nbp = 250bp
θ = π

Rcore = 5nm
Zcore = 200

Appendix C: estimation of untrapping time
for crossed conﬁguration

Although, the precise collision scenario is not known, one might an-
ticipate that the longest time (which is the relevant time to estimate
for the mobility calculation) is associated with the rotation of bead-
complex around gel ﬁbers. This rotation is driven by the electric ﬁeld
that exerts a torque on the complex.

An estimation of this torque is simply made in the case of planar

conﬁguration of the complex (cf ﬁgure 6). The result reads

where Rg = d/2 is the gel ﬁber radius. The charge density of DNA is
q = Zbead/2Rbead. The length of the two arms are L1 and L2.

According to Eq. 12, the trapping time is mainly determined by
integrating the inverse of electrostatic torque between two angles ϕ1
and ϕ2 that represent respectively the initial and ﬁnal orientations of
the bead-complex during the collision. Instead of calculating such inte-
grals, and eventually averaging over initial and ﬁnal angles, we plotted
the inverse of the torque for various arm lengths at ﬁxed opening angle
θ in ﬁgure 6b since we are mainly interested in the way trapping time

Nucleosome electrophoresis

changes with nucleosome position: the main result is that for any cou-
ple of reasonable angles ϕ1 and ϕ2, the trapping time increases going
from end-position to middle-position nucleosomes since curves sit on
top of each others without crossing. As a consequence, this simple ar-
gument shows qualitatively that end-position nucleosome will migrate
faster than middle-position ones in a scenario where trapping deter-
mines the dynamics. Similarly, plotting the inverse torque for various
opening angle at ﬁxed arm lengths shows that trapping time increases
with opening angle in the range θ = [0, π], and therefore the mobility
decreases with the opening angle in the same range, in qualitative ag-
greement with the results of continuous electro-hydrodynamics model.

Abstract

We study the statistical mechanics of grafted polymers of arbitrary stiﬀness in a two-dimensional

embedding space with Monte Carlo simulations. The probability distribution function of the free

end is found to be highly anisotropic and non-Gaussian for typical semiﬂexible polymers. The

reduced distribution in the transverse direction, a Gaussian in the stiﬀ and ﬂexible limits, shows

a double peak structure at intermediate stiﬀnesses. We also explore the response to a transverse

force applied at the polymer free end. We identify F-Actin as an ideal benchmark for the eﬀects

discussed.

Healthy cells require an eﬃcient and complex transport network to carry out the over-

whelming number of tasks that are needed to accomplish their function. This network, also

known as the cytoskeleton, is formed primarily by ﬁlaments (actin ﬁlaments, microtubules

and intermediate ﬁlaments), linked together by a large collection of accessory proteins [1].

A complete description of the structural and mechanical properties of these ﬁlaments is

therefore essential in order to unveil the mechanical properties of the entire cell. Advances

in the ﬁeld have been signiﬁcantly promoted by a unique set of optical and mechanical tech-

niques which allow to visualize and manipulate single cytoskeletal ﬁlaments [2, 3, 4] and

DNA [5]. Fluorescence videomicroscopy [6] and nano-manipulation [7] can be conveniently

used to obtain quantities as the distribution function of the end-to-end distance [6] or the

mechanical response to an external force in great detail and at the single molecule level.

These quantities are amenable to a direct comparison with theoretical models.

The main material parameter in the description of a polymer ﬁlament is its persistence

length, ℓp. It is deﬁned as the typical length over which correlations of the tangent vectors

of the ﬁlament contour decay. Polymers are considered to be ﬂexible when their persistence

length is small compared to their total length L, or t := L/ℓp & 10. In this limit, they can

be well described by the minimal model of the Gaussian Chain [8]. Polymers of biological

importance, e.g. F-actin, are often semiﬂexible, meaning that their persistence length is

comparable to their total length. While ﬂexible polymers are dominated by entropic eﬀects,

the statistical mechanics of semiﬂexible polymers is strongly aﬀected by their bending energy

and the close vicinity of the classical Euler instability for buckling a rigid beam [9].

The distribution function P ( ~R) of the end-to-end vector ~R, a simple Gaussian for a

ﬂexible polymer, is peaked towards full stretching and is completely non-Gaussian [10].

The mechanical response of a semiﬂexible polymer is highly anisotropic, depending on the

direction in which the force is applied [11]. These ﬁndings result in bulk properties of

solutions and networks that are completely diﬀerent from the isotropic elasticity of ﬂexible

polymer solutions [12, 13].

In addition, the inextensibility constraint becomes crucial in

determining the approach to full stretching upon the application of a force f , as reported

by Marko and Siggia [5] for double–stranded DNA.

Here we investigate the mechanical and statistical properties of a single chain grafted

at one end, a problem of direct relevance for force generation in cellular systems. The

other end is either free, or subject to a constant transverse force, whose magnitude extends

2

into the non–linear regime. We restrict ourselves to a two–dimensional embedding space,

since in most experiments, ﬂuctuations in one direction are severely restricted, or cannot be

observed. The generalization to a three–dimensional space is straightforward and will be

reported elsewhere [14].

We refer to the Wormlike Chain Model (WLC) introduced by Kratky and Porod [15].
In this framework, a polymer conformation is represented by a succession of N segments ~ti,

whose direction is tangent to the polymer contour at the ith segment. Since the polymer
is assumed to be inextensible, all segments ~ti have a prescribed length a = L/N. The

Hamiltonian is given by:

where ε is the energy associated to each bond and ~f is a force eventually applied to the

second end. It is also possible to deﬁne a continuum limit for a → 0, N → ∞, with Na = L
and ǫ = εa2/N held ﬁxed. The Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 is then equivalent to the following

functional [16, 17]:

(cid:12)

of the end-to-end distance distribution [16, 18].

It has been recently used to obtain the

radial distribution function [10], and force-extension relations [5, 11, 19].

We have developed a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the behavior of a semiﬂexible

polymer in the proximity of the limit t → 1. The rationale behind this choice is the search

for clear hallmarks of the onset of the “semiﬂexible” nature of a ﬁlament.

In this inter-

mediate limit, analytical results are diﬃcult to obtain: typical approximation schemes that

build on either Gaussian chains or rigid rods are outside their validity range; hence, com-

puter simulations become crucial. The ﬁrst end of the ﬁlament is assumed to be clamped,

i.e. the orientation of its tangent vector is held ﬁxed along a direction, named the x-axis.

The second end is left free to assume any possible orientation. The initial conﬁguration has

been randomly chosen in the proximity of the full stretching condition, thus ensuring a fast

convergence to equilibrium. A new conﬁguration is generated by changing the orientation of

3

one segment and accepted according to the standard Metropolis algorithm and the discrete

Hamiltonian, Eq. 1. Eﬀects resulting from self–avoidance are not considered, but we notice

that conﬁgurations where the chain folds back onto itself are strongly energetically sup-

pressed for suﬃciently stiﬀ polymers. Results ceased to depend on the number of segments
for N = 50. On the order of 106 Monte Carlo steps per segment were performed, and results

were averaged over diﬀerent runs, obtaining a perfect agreement between measured expec-
tation values of the end-to-end distance hR2i and hR4i with known exact expressions. The

radial distribution function was calculated and coincided with the analytic results in [10]

within the accuracy thereby reported.

Here we are interested in the probability distribution function P (x, y) of the free end

in the plane determined by the direction of the clamped end (x-axis) and the transverse

one (y-axis). This quantity is directly accessible to experiments allowing for a quantitative

comparison with our predictions. We will also consider the reduced distribution functions

P (x) and P (y), obtained by integrating P (x, y) over the variables y and x, respectively.

It is important to notice that when both ends are free, the radial distribution function is

rotationally invariant and is therefore only a function of the distance R between the ends.

Clamping one end breaks rotational symmetry and leads to distinctly diﬀerent longitudinal

and transverse distribution functions, P (x) and P (y). Nonetheless, the broken rotational

symmetry does not aﬀect the total energy of the conﬁguration. This implies, and is in fact

conﬁrmed by our simulations (data not shown), that the longitudinal distribution function

P (x) coincides with the radial distribution function P (R) of the end-to-end distance, apart

from a constant normalization factor. The characteristic feature of this function is a crossover

from a universal Gaussian shape centered at the origin with a characteristic width determined

by the radius of gyration, to yet another universal shape [10], whose peak is shifted towards
full stretching and whose width is determined by a new longitudinal length scale Lk ∝ L2/ℓp.

This has to be contrasted with the transverse distribution function. Not surprisingly,

given the intrinsic isotropy of ﬂexible polymers, the distribution P (y) is a Gaussian and

identical to P (x) for high values of t.

In the stiﬀ limit, P (y), at variance with P (x),

is again a Gaussian centered at y = 0, whose width is now given by a new transverse

length scale L⊥ =

2L3/3ℓp [20, 21]. Surprisingly, at intermediate values the probability

distribution function is not a smooth interpolation between these two Gaussian limits but

p

shows interesting and qualitatively new features. As t approaches the value 1 from above

(ﬂexible side), the Gaussian peak is ﬁrst smeared out into an intrinsically non-Gaussian

ﬂat distribution (see Fig. 1a). At t = 2.8 (see inset), the distribution contains three local

maxima, but as t is decreased, the central peak at y = 0 loses weight to the two symmetric

peaks oﬀ the x axis. The double-peak structure is most pronounced around t ≈ 1.5, i.e.

As the stiﬀness is increased, P (y) recovers its ﬂat structure, as shown in Fig. 1b. Notice

also (inset of Fig. 1b) that at t = 0.75 the two peaks start to compete with a growing peak

centered at y = 0, such that one ﬁnds a triple maxima shape again. Although intrinsically

non–Gaussian, this central peak will eventually tend to a Gaussian distribution in the stiﬀ

limit. The re-entrance from the double peak structure to a ﬂat distribution is a genuine

hallmark of semiﬂexibility. This eﬀect cannot be explained by analytical calculations using

a harmonic (or weakly bending rod) approximation, whose prediction for P (y) would be a

Gaussian centered at 0 [20]. Higher order cumulant expansions about a Gaussian distribution

have also failed to provide a fast convergence to our P (y). An entirely analytical solution

can be provided by the eigenfunction approach described in [22] for persistent random walks,

although the connection to our probability distributions would only be numerical.

Finally, let us emphasize that the double-peak structure of P (y) does not indicate a

bistability in the constant force ensemble. As shown below, linear response theory leads to

positive force constants in this regime. What actually happens under the application of an

external force is that the distribution function becomes asymmetric and weight is shifted

from one peak to the other. In an experimental setting with a ﬁxed transverse distance y

and a correspondingly adjusting force, one would probe P (y) directly and be able to observe

a kind of “bistability”.

Further insight can be gained by the inspection of the joint distribution function P (x, y),

represented with density plots in Fig. 2. In the stiﬀ limit, P (x, y) should be conﬁned to the

FIG. 2: Density plots obtained by Monte Carlo simulations: dense regions are colored in red,

classical contour obtained by applying the elasticity equations to a rigid rod. This contour

can be approximated by a parabola in the proximity of full stretching and is obtained through

6

elliptic functions for any deformation [9]. In Fig. 2a the classical contour coincides with the

ridge of the probability distribution function. As we relax the stiﬀness, thermal ﬂuctuations

will make the tip of the ﬁlament explore the conﬁguration space in the vicinity of the classical

contour. Roughly speaking, transverse (bending) ﬂuctuations enhance ﬂuctuations along the

classical contour and shift weight from the center to the upper and lower wings in Fig. 2a–b.

In contrast, longitudinal ﬂuctuations widen the distribution function perpendicular to the

classical contour. Since for a semiﬂexible polymer, the corresponding lengths Lk and L⊥

scale diﬀerently (transverse ﬂuctuations are much “softer” than longitudinal ones), upon

lowering the stiﬀness P (x, y) gains more weight in the wings rather than in the center. It is

precisely this eﬀect that gives rise to the double peak distribution, when P (x, y) is projected

in the transverse direction (see Fig. 2b). Eventually, in the ﬂexible limit, where transverse

and longitudinal ﬂuctuations become comparable, P (x, y) is spread so as to cover almost all

the available space (Fig. 2c), before the isotropic Gaussian distribution is recovered (Fig. 2d).

We have also explored the transverse response of semiﬂexible polymers by applying a

constant force f in the transverse direction. The eﬀect of a small applied force on the

average end-to-end distance (or force extension relation) has been studied within linear-

response in [11]. In this work, we will consider the eﬀect of an external transverse force of

arbitrary magnitude on the average position hxif and hyif of the free end.

In general, we expect hyif to have the same parity of the applied force, and hence to be
odd, while hxif should not depend on the sign of the force and hence should be even. In
the continuum limit, it is possible to write down the exact expressions for hxif and hyif and
to show that the expected parities hold on very general grounds and that the response of

the longitudinal extension to a transverse force is intrinsically nonlinear in the small force

regime. Monte Carlo simulations conﬁrm these predictions, as shown in Fig. 3. The response

in the direction of the clamped end is even in f and it can be approximated by a parabola

centered on the f = 0 axis. The response in the transverse direction is odd in f and shows

the same re-entrance phenomenon reported in [11] for the linear response coeﬃcient.

Note that while in the case of a longitudinal force, the approach towards full stretching

(or saturation) can be calculated within the weakly bending rod approximation, this is

no longer true for transverse forces. The position of the free end can be calculated from

classical elasticity theory [9] and expressed by means of elliptic functions. Only in the high

force regime or in the stiﬀ limit, when ﬂuctuations become unimportant, results from our

7

simulations coincide with classical elasticity theory.

in units of kBT /L, lengths in units of L. Error bars are shown. (Above) Response in the clamping

direction. (Below) Response in the transverse direction is odd with f : only part of the explored

The eﬀects hereby reported are amenable to a direct comparison with experiments regard-

ing cytoskeletal ﬁlaments, or even DNA. For instance, optical systems might be used to get

the x or y projection of the radial distribution function for a particular class of semiﬂexible

polymers. For F-Actin with ℓp ≈ 16 µm [6], the double peak eﬀect should be well visible for

a range of lengths, 12 µm . L . 43 µm. In this parameter range the diﬀerence between the

central relative minimum and the double peaks maxima results in 10% of the total length

(see Fig. 1), in the range 1 ÷ 4 µm that is well above the experimental precision of 0.05 µm

reported by [6]. Hence F-Actin would provide an ideal benchmark for the eﬀects we report.

We emphasize that the double peak structure is a clear hallmark of semiﬂexibility and hence

it might be used to obtain a rough estimate of the persistence length of a particular polymer

ﬁlament, as for instance the nanometer sized stalks of kinesins and myosins.

In summary, we have presented evidence from extensive Monte Carlo simulations that the

parameter region corresponding to semiﬂexible polymers is hallmarked by the appearance

of a series of eﬀects in the radial distribution function and in the response of the clamped

polymer to an external transverse force. A semiﬂexible polymer shows a distinct anisotropy

in the probability distribution function of the free end along the direction of the clamped

end. At intermediate stiﬀness, L ≈ ℓp, the distribution function shows a pronounced dou-

ble peak structure in the transverse direction. Semiﬂexible polymers have been previously

reported [11] to be anisotropic objects, i.e. to respond in diﬀerent ways to forces applied

in the clamping or transverse direction. Here we have shown that even their response to

a force along the transverse direction alone is intrinsically anisotropic, being linear in the

transverse direction and non-linear along the direction of the clamped end in the small force

regime.

We apply generic order parameter equations for the emergence of retinotopy between manifolds of
diﬀerent geometry derived in part 1 of this series of papers to one- and two-dimensional Euclidean
manifolds. Our results for strings are analogous to those for discrete linear chains obtained previously
by H¨aussler and von der Malsburg. The case of planes turns out to be more involved as the two
dimensions do not decouple in a trivial way. However, superimposing two modes under suitable
conditions provides a state with a pronounced retinotopic character.

INTRODUCTION

In a preceding paper [1] we have developed, using the methods of synergetics, a general model for the formation
of retinotopic projections independent of geometry and dimension. In this paper we discuss, as a ﬁrst application
of the general model, Euclidean geometries in one and two dimensions. To put these investigations into perspective
we brieﬂy recall their physiological motivations.
In the course of ontogenesis of vertebrate animals well-ordered
neural connections are established between retina and tectum, a part of the brain which plays an important role
in processing optical information. At an initial stage of ontogenesis, the ganglion cells of the retina have random
synaptic contacts with the tectum. In the adult animal, however, neighbouring retinal cells project onto neighbouring
cells of the tectum [2]. A detailed analytical treatment by H¨aussler and von der Malsburg was able to describe the
generation of such retinotopic states from an undiﬀerentiated initial state as a self-organization process [3]. In that
work retina and tectum were treated as one-dimensional discrete cell arrays. The dynamics of the connection weights
between retina and tectum was assumed to be governed by the so-called H¨aussler equations which are based on
modelling the interplay between cooperative and competitive interactions of the individual synaptic contacts. The
analysis was performed by using the methods of synergetics, which provides eﬀective analytical methods to study
self-organization processes in complex systems [4, 5].

Obviously, the description of cell sheets as linear chains with the same number of cells is an inadequate approach to
the real biological situation. In the preceding paper of this series we generalized the underlying H¨aussler equations to
continuous manifolds of arbitrary geometry and dimension in Ref. [1]. We performed an extensive synergetic analysis
of these generalized H¨aussler equations. The resulting generic order parameter equations represented a central new
result and can now serve as a starting point to analyze in detail the self-organized emergence of one-to-one mappings
in cell arrays of diﬀerent geometries. A brief survey of our generalization of the H¨aussler equations and the results of
the corresponding synergetic analysis is provided in Section II.

In this paper we focus on the modelling of retina and tectum as one- and two-dimensional Euclidean manifolds.
We show in Section III that the treatment of strings yields results which are analogous to those obtained for discrete
linear chains in Ref. [3], i.e. our model includes the special case discussed by H¨aussler and von der Malsburg. However,
our synergetic analysis is more general. Instead of discrete cell arrays with the same number of cells, we consider
continuously distributed cells on strings of diﬀerent lengths [6]. Furthermore, we do not restrict our investigations to
monotonically decreasing cooperativity functions of strings. We investigate under what circumstances non-retinotopic

modes become unstable and destroy retinotopic order. Finally, we show in Section IV that our generic order parameter
equations also provide a suitable framework to describe the emergence of retinotopy between planes.

II. THE GENERAL MODEL

To make the present paper self-contained, we brieﬂy review the essential results of our general model for the self-
organized emergence of retinotopic projections between manifolds of diﬀerent geometry in Ref. [1]. The two cell sheets,
retina and tectum, are represented by general manifolds
MT , respectively. Every ordered pair (t, r) with
MR and
t
∈ MR is connected by a connection weight w(t, r) as is illustrated in Figure 1. The equations of evolution
∈ MT , r
of these connection weights are assumed to be given by a generalization of the H¨aussler equations

where the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side describes cooperative synaptic growth processes and the other terms stand
for corresponding competitive growth processes. Here the total growth rates are deﬁned by

dt′

dr′cT (t, t′) cR(r, r′) w(t′, r′)

and α denotes the global growth rate of new synapses onto the tectum which represents the control parameter of our
system. The cooperativity functions cT (t, t′), cR(r, r′) represent the neural connectivity within each manifold. We
assume that they are positive, symmetric with respect to their arguments and normalized. The cooperation strength
depends on the distance between two points of the manifold. This requires a measure of distance, i.e. metrices, which
in turn deﬁne Laplace-Beltrami operators on the manifolds. Their eigenvalue problems yield a complete orthonormal
system ψλT (t) , ψλR (r), and the generalized H¨aussler equations are most conveniently transformed to this new basis.
For example, the cooperativity functions are expanded in terms of these functions as follows:

cT (t, t′) =

fλT ψλT (t)ψ∗

λT (t′) ,

cR(r, r′) =

fλRψλR (r)ψ∗

The initial state of ontogenesis with randomly distributed synaptic contacts is described by the stationary uniform
solution of the generalized H¨aussler equations w0(t, r) = 1.
Its stability is analyzed by linearizing the H¨aussler
equations (1) with respect to the deviation v(t, r) = w(t, r)

w0(t, r). The resulting linearized equations read

The linear stability analysis motivates to treat the nonlinear H¨aussler equations (1) near the instability by decom-

posing the deviation v(t, r) = w(t, r)

w0(t, r) in unstable and stable contributions according to

−

v(t, r) = U (t, r) + S(t, r) .

represents the contribution of the stable modes. Note that the summation in (10) is performed over all parameters
(λT ; λR) except for (λu
R), i.e. from now on the parameters (λT ; λR) stand for the stable modes alone. With the
help of the slaving principle of synergetics the original high-dimensional system can be reduced to a low-dimensional
one which only contains the unstable amplitudes. The general form of the resulting order parameter equations is
independent of the geometry of the problem and reads

The order parameter equations (11) for the generalized H¨aussler equations (1) can now serve as a starting point for
analysing the self-organized formation of retinotopic projections between manifolds of diﬀerent geometry.

III. STRINGS

In this section we specialize the generic order parameter equations (11) to one-dimensional Euclidean manifolds of
strings with diﬀerent lengths LT and LR. We observe that the quadratic term vanishes and derive selection rules for
the appearance of cubic terms. In this way we essentially simplify the calculation of order parameter equations as
compared with Ref. [3]. Furthermore, we show that the order parameter equations represent a potential dynamics,
and determine the underlying potential. A subsequent transformation from complex to real order parameters leads to
constant phase-shift angles. This allows us to reduce the order parameter dynamics to two variables which correspond
to the amplitudes of two diagonal modes. These two modes compete with each other, until one of them vanishes.
Within the potential picture this means that the originally stable uniform state becomes unstable and the system
settles in one of the two potential minima. After one of the diagonal modes has won, only such modes are excited which
contribute to the sharpening of the diagonal. Approximately solving the H¨aussler equations leads to the following
scenario: Above a critical global growth rate αc the uniform state w0(t, r) = 1 is stable. By decreasing the control
parameter α, the projection gets sharper and sharper. Finally, if there is no global growth rate of new synapses any
more, i.e. α = 0, the connection weights are given by Dirac’s delta function. Thus, a perfect one-to-one retinotopic
state is realized.

A. Eigenfunctions

The magnitudes of the manifolds

MR are given by MT = LT and MR = LR, respectively. To avoid
problems at the boundaries, we assume periodic boundary conditions, i.e. we consider retina and tectum to be rings
with circumferences LT and LR, respectively. The eigenvalue problem of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for both
manifolds reads

MT and

∂2
∂x2 ψλ(x) = χλψλ(x) ,
with x = t, r, respectively. Using the boundary condition ψλ(x) = ψλ(x + L), this is solved by the eigenfunctions

(18)

where the eigenvalues are given by

Note that the orthonormality relation (21) follows directly by inserting (19) into (21), whereas the completeness

B. Synergetic Analysis

To specialize the order parameter equations (11) to the case of strings, we have to determine the integrals (12) and

(13) of products of eigenfunctions. With (19) we obtain

I λ
λ(1)λ(2)... λ(n) =

δλ(1)+λ(2)+...+λ(n),λ ,

In (14) the integral (26) occurs only with unstable values of λ. As they can only diﬀer by their sign, it follows
λ′ + λ′′

λ′ λ′′ = 0, i.e. the quadratic term (14) in (11) vanishes:

= λ. Thus, we have I λ

The ﬁrst term K1 takes into account the contribution of the order parameters themselves, while the second term K2
represents the inﬂuence of the center manifold on the order parameter dynamics. Applying the integrals (26)–(28)
leads to selection rules for the appearance of cubic terms. It turns out that only those sums lead to non-vanishing

D. Real Order Parameters

For technical purposes it has turned out to be useful to work with complex order parameters so far. However, in
order to investigate their contribution to a one-to-one mapping between the strings, we have to transform them to real
variables. We construct at ﬁrst the real modes from the eigenfunctions (6), (19) of the linear operator ˆL according to

cλT λR (t, r) =

is that the real order parameter equations (59) are also valid in the case where the cooperativity functions are not
monotonic so that any mode (λu
R) can become unstable. It is plausible that there is a pathological development
in animals which corresponds to this case.

In the stable region with Λ < 0 only the relative minimum ξ = η = 0 does exist. Initially, the system is in the stable
uniform state w0(t, r) = 1. This state becomes unstable if the control parameter α is decreased to the critical value
αc = f T
1 becomes positive, and the minimum passes into a maximum. The
system settles into one of the two equivalent minima, i.e. a symmetry breaking takes place. Thereby the two modes
compete with each other and, subsequently, one of the two modes vanishes. Which of them vanishes depends on the
initial conditions of ξ and η. If the condition η(0) > ξ(0) is fulﬁlled, the ξ-mode vanishes, and vice versa.

remains. These two modes show a pronounced maximum for t =

To assess the inﬂuence of higher modes, we calculate the center manifold S(U ). We consider the case ξ = 0 and η
and set u4 = 0 without loss of generality. Then it follows from (55) that η = u3, and we obtain for the unstable part

Thus, those modes are excited which strengthen the retinotopic character of the projection. With the help of the
complex modes it can be seen that this is also the case for higher modes, i.e. for (λu
R) = (1, 1) exclusively the
modes (2, 2), (3, 3) etc. are excited, which are depicted in Figure 4. Therefore, we follow Ref. [3] and use an ansatz
which contains only diagonal modes and insert it into the H¨aussler equations (1). If we restrict ourselves to special
cooperativity functions, the resulting recursion relations can be solved analytically by using the method of generating
function. Note that our derivation of the solution of the recursion relations corresponds to the gravitating chain in
Ref. [3].

the connection weight is essentially uniform with a small maximum for t/LT =
to a sharpening of the projection. In the case α
0 the projection becomes Dirac’s delta function, i.e. a perfect
one-to-one retinotopy is achieved. This means that the undiﬀerentiated growth of new synaptic contacts comes to an
end when the ordered projection between retina and tectum is fully developed.

Finally, we compare our results for strings with those of Ref. [3] where retina and tectum were treated as linear

chains consisting of N cells, respectively. In that reference, the order parameter equations read

The comparison of the coeﬃcients A, B according to (66), (67) with γ(2
the factor 1/LT LR in A and B as well as the term 2Λ in the denominator. The absence of the corresponding factor
1/N 2 in Ref. [3] stems from the circumstance that the eigenfunctions were not normalized there. Physically more
interesting is the appearance of the term 2Λ in the denominator of A, B. The reason for this is that we have used
the mathematically correct equation for the center manifold (17), whereas in Ref. [3] the adiabatic approximation
˙S = 0 was used. However, this ad-hoc method for implementing the adiabatic approximation, which is frequently
used in the literature, is only justiﬁed for real eigenvalues. As the eigenvalues of the strings are real, we deduce for
the vicinity of the instability point the relation

FIG. 6: Bifurcation in the vicinity of the instability point for the linear chain as analyzed in Ref. [3]. The quadratic arrangement
of the two linear chains allows a concise representation of the connection weights. Dark gray means high connection weights
between the corresponding cells t and r. At the uniform initial state all connection weights are equal. The bifurcation drives
the system into one of the two possible states, which diﬀer in their orientation. Decreasing the control parameter α to zero
leads to a one-to-one retinotopy. Instead of a delta function in the continuous case, here the retinotopic order is described by
Kronecker deltas.

Furthermore, our results for the continuous case are analogous to the results for discrete cell arrays. Also the
transition to a perfect one-to-one retinotopy takes place in a corresponding way, as is illustrated in Figure 6. Thus,
we conclude that our geometry-independent model for the emergence of retinotopic projections developed in Ref. [1]
contains as a special case the results of Ref. [3]. In addition, we have extended the range of validity, i.e. the domain
around the instability with Λ = 0, where the order parameter equations represent a quantitatively good approximation,
as we have derived a more precise form of the center manifold (17).

IV. PLANES

In this section we extend our discussion to two dimensions where the cell sheets are assumed to be planes of
side lengths LT
2 , respectively. To obtain a consistent solution we assume again periodic boundary
conditions, i.e. the cell sheets are modelled as surfaces of tori. It turns out that we then have to calculate in total
sixteen order parameter equations where the quadratic term vanishes, as in the case of strings, and where again
selection rules reduce the number of cubic terms. This order parameter dynamics turns out to be complicated as
the two dimensions do not decouple in a trivial way. Therefore, we have to restrict our analytical discussion of
the order parameter dynamics to physiologically interesting special cases.
If we set all modes to zero except for

modes and investigate the necessary conditions for their coexistence.
for instance,
when the cooperativity function of the tectum is monotonically decreasing, whereas the cooperativity function
of the retina is not monotonic. Furthermore, we show that taking into account the center manifold contribution
or higher modes leads to a sharpening of the retinotopic character of the projection between planar retina and tectum.

Such a situation occurs,

the decoupling (101) amounts to a factorization of the expansion coeﬃcients:

With this we allow for both anisotropic and isotropic cooperativity functions. This is an interesting feature as it is
reasonable to assume that real cell sheets have a preferential direction.

We analyze which modes become unstable. According to (7) this depends on the expansion coeﬃcients and the

maximum eigenvalues are given by

By doing so we require that all unstable modes become unstable simultaneously. This requirement is due to the fact
that the order parameter equations should be approximately valid in the vicinity of the instability point. If the eigen-
values of the corresponding unstable modes would diﬀer signiﬁcantly, the situation that all modes are in the unstable
region would have the consequence that the maximum eigenvalue would be larger than zero, i.e. far away from the
instability point. Thus, the order parameter equations would be no adequate approximation. Consequently, we only

It can be shown that the order parameter dynamics (126), (127) is governed by a potential [8]. However, as the
corresponding expression for the potential is very lengthy, we will not discuss it here explicitly. Instead, we investigate
diﬀerent analytical cases which depend on the number of non-vanishing modes. In particular, we are interested in the
emergence of retinotopical ordered projections between the planes.

E. Retinotopic Projections: One Non-Vanishing Mode

We start with the assumption that only the amplitudes uj, vj of one mode are diﬀerent from zero. We consider the

case j = 2, but the other cases yield analogous results. The unstable part (9) reads

satisﬁed. However, this implies that, although the cooperativity function of the tectum is monotonically decreasing,
the cooperativity function of the retina is not monotonic, as is illustrated in Figure 7. The corresponding potential

In the next step we analyze the inﬂuence of the center manifold S(U ) for the special case (151). With (8) the

connection weight can be represented as

In Figure 9 we compare U (t, r) with U (t, r) + S(U (t, r)). It is evident that the retinotopic projection gets sharper due
to the contribution of the center manifold, i.e. the projection is maximal around the point t = r. This corresponds to
the situation found in the case of linear strings; the contribution of the higher modes have the tendency to support
the emergence of retinotopic order.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper we have explicitly applied our generic model for the emergence of retinotopic projections between
manifolds of diﬀerent geometry to one- and two-dimensional Euclidean manifolds. By treating retina and tectum
as strings we generalized the original approach of H¨aussler and von der Malsburg where both were modelled as
one-dimensional discrete cell arrays. This change from discrete to continuous variables is physiologically reasonable
because of the high cell density in vertebrate animals. By using a continuous instead of a discrete model we emphasized
that we are not interested in the dynamics of the single cell but in the evolving global spatio-temporal patterns of
the system. Furthermore, continuous variables are helpful to describe retinotopic projections between manifolds of
diﬀerent magnitudes as we have seen by the example of two strings of diﬀerent lengths.
In case of discrete cell
arrays with diﬀerent cell numbers it is not clear what a perfect retinotopy means, whereas in the continuous case a
perfect one-to-one projection can be described without oﬀending the bijectivity of the projections. Finally, as the
one-dimensional string model could only serve as a simplistic approximation to the real biological situation, we have
also investigated under which conditions retinotopic projections between planar networks of neurons arise. Obviously,
this increase of the spatial dimension rendered the synergetic analysis so complicated that we were only able to treat

cooperativity functions, we found that this is no longer true for planes.

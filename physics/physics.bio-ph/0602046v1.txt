Abstract

We argue that the paradoxal softness of the red blood cells (RBC) in ﬂuctua-

tion spectra experiments is apparent. We show that the eﬀective surface shear

modulus µs of the RBC obtained from ﬂuctuation data and that measured

in static deformation experiments have the same order of magnitude. A sim-

ple micromechanical model of the RBC developped for this purpose accounts

for the inﬂuence of a ﬁnite-thickness cytoskeleton on the ﬂuctuations of the

composite membrane-cytoskeleton system. The spectrin network cytoskele-

ton with the bulk shear modulus estimated as µ

105

165 Pa contributes

≈

÷

both to normal and tangent ﬂuctuations of the system and conﬁnes the ﬂuc-

tuations of the lipid membrane. The ratio of mean square amplitudes of the

RBC normal and tangent ﬂuctuations < X 2

n > / < X 2

t > calculated in the

frame of the model is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller that it is in the free

membrane with the same bending and shear moduli.

The mechanical properties and ﬂuctuation spectrum of the living cell depend strongly

on the coupling between its ﬂuid phospholipid membrane (ME) and stiﬀ cytoskeleton (CS)

composed of the cross-linked biopolimer networks [1-4]. In red blood cells (RBC), investi-

gated intensively by physicists since many years [5-7], the coupling between the lipid bilayer

and the spectrin ﬁlaments network provides the ME with viscoelastic properties. In addi-

tion to its bending modulus K

10−19

10−20 J, the RBC ME acquires two dimensional

≈

−

(2D) static shear modulus revealed by micropipette suction [5] or by other types of static

deformation response. Measurements of thermally activated shape ﬂuctuations [8] reﬁne

the picture and give the access to the dynamic properties of RBC. The basic theoretical

model [9] explaining both statics and dynamics of RBC considered the ME as practically

independent on the CS inﬂuence, but with strongly variable 2D shear modulus. Namely,

thermally excited surface undulations of RBC (the cell ﬂickering) [8] was described as a

motion of a ﬂuid ME with µs

0. Thus the free ME model [9] has established the opinion

≈

that RBC combine paradoxally liquid-like and solid-like mechanical properties, with solid-

like behavior being manifested only during large-scale shape changes [9-10]. However, the

modern microrheological technique [e.g. 11-12] has shown that mechanical behavior of RBC

satisﬁes Hook’s law in a broad region of deformation [13]. This result is incompatible with

both deformation scale separation principle and non-linear shear modulus behavior resulting

from the model [9].

As it will be shown later apparent softness of RBC obtained from the ﬁt of thermal ﬂuc-

tuation spectra by the free ME model is related to the simpliﬁed form of its elastic energy. In

[9] it is reduced to the ME bending and shear terms only. In recent theoretical works [14-17]

it was proposed to take into account the inﬂuence of viscoelastic CS properties on the coarse-

grained mechanics of the composite ME-CS system. Energy of surface tension and especially

the term responsible for the ME conﬁnement were introduced in the system’s Hamiltonian

[16-17]. Resulting model has lead to the signiﬁcant progress in the understanding of the

eﬀective bending modulus behavior during normal ﬂuctuations. By contrast, model [16-17]

could not explain the main RBC paradox : the apparent change of its shear properties from

2

the solid-like to the liquid-like ones. In approach [16-17] the CS was treated as an inﬁnitely

rigid shell (i.e. with an inﬁnite shear modulus) making impossible the calculation of the

eﬀective shear modulus for the ME-CS structure. Inﬁnite rigidity of the CS prevents any

tangent ﬂuctuation in the model, and thus does not allow to compare its predictions with

the results of the free ME model [9]. Note that the conclusion about liquid-like behavior of

RBC was obtained in [9] from the calculation of the ratio < X 2

n > / < X 2

t > of mean-square

amplitudes of normal and tangent ﬂuctuations (see Fig. 1).

In the present work we propose more realistic continuum model of the composite ME-

CS system which brings a solution to the paradoxal problem of the RBC apparent softness

in thermal ﬂuctuation measurements. We show that the 2D shear modulus of the RBC

obtained from the ﬂuctuation data and that measured in static deformation experiments

have the same order of magnitude µs

10−6 N/m. For that purpose, in addition to the

6

≈

×

ME conﬁnement, we take into account the contribution of normal and tangent ﬂuctuation

modes of a ﬁnite-thickness CS to the surface free energy of the ME-CS system. These

modes, determined in the simplest case of incompressible CS by its bulk shear modulus µ

only, are rapidly attenuated in the cell interior. Normal CS ﬂuctuations modify the ME

bending properties and tangent ﬂuctuations supply the composite system with a ﬁnite 2D

shear modulus µs. Mean-square amplitudes of normal and tangent ﬂuctuations of the system

are calculated in the framework of the proposed model. They are perfectly consistent with

the RBC ﬂicker spectroscopy data [8,18] but their ratio < X 2

n > / < X 2

t > is 2-3 orders

of magnitude smaller than that attributed in [9] to the solid-like ME. This result shows

that the RBC ﬂuctuational softness is apparent and its shear properties in both static and

dynamic experiments are the same.

The material constants for these estimations were obtained by a double-step numerical

ﬁt of the eﬀective bending rigidity dependence on the wave vector q [18]. The same type of

experimental data is frequently used in the theoretical estimations of the RBC mechanical

properties [16,17,19]. The data being obtained using classical Fourier transform, the models

are usually formulated in the framework of plane geometry. We also follow this approach but

3

limit the region of its applicability. A model which does not take into account the curvature

of the system is valid [14-17] only for a treatment of ﬂuctuations with the wavelengths

λ << R, where R

4 µm is the eﬀective RBC radius. The description of the ME-CS

≈

system motion is performed then in terms of continuum mechanics. This approximation is

favored by the fact that the attachment points between the spectrin network and the bilayer

are rather rare and their area is negligible (Fig. 1). Besides the actin nodes there exist

additional ME-CS connections through ankryn complexes distributed randomly. Together

with defects and dynamic structural rearrangements in the spectrin network they contribute

to the entropic elasticity of the RBC CS and justify the continuum description. Finally,

we consider the ﬂuctuation wavelength region for which the inﬂuence of active processes is

reduced to the increase in the eﬀective temperature [20-21].

The free energy of normal thermal ﬂuctuations of a ME-CS system contains the ﬂuctu-

ation energy of a ﬂat ME and the CS contribution W :

Here um is a normal displacement of the ME, K, σ and γ are the coeﬃcients of bending,

surface tension and pinning of the ME, respectively; uc is a displacement ﬁeld of the CS.

The ME ﬂuctuation energy (ﬁrst three terms in Eq. (1)) is limited to the sum of bending,

surface tension and ME conﬁnement energy contributions. In a plane geometry adopted in

the present work bending ﬂuctuations are independent on stretching and the energy due to

the bending-stretching coupling can be omitted, though in a general system with curvature

it cannot be neglected [15,22,23]. The CS is considered as an incompressible viscoelastic

plate (Fig. 1) with the thickness h

0.03 µm and with a ﬁnite 3D shear modulus µ. The

4

system the motion of both ME and CS is overdamped. Thus the state of CS is determined

from the motion equation of an incompressible medium with neglected inertia terms:

p = µ∆uc + η ˙uc

∇

with p standing for pressure, η for the CS viscosity and ˙uc for the CS velocity ﬁeld. Thermally

excited CS ﬂuctuation modes are rapidly attenuated in the direction perpendicular to the

ME plane. The solution of Eq. (2) compatible with bending ﬂuctuations of the ME and

satisfying div uc = 0 condition describes the mode of this type:

The wave vector of ﬂuctuations in (4-6) is chosen along the x axis, Uq expresses the am-

plitude of normal displacements at the ME-CS interface z = 0 (see Fig. 2). All tangent

displacements in the mode of this type vanish at the interface.

In the present work we consider the physical situation, where at the interface the CS

velocities

˙uc and displacements uc coincide with those of the ME:

˙uc

z=0 = ∂um/∂t and

|

uc

z=0 = um. In a more complicated case of ME-CS mutual gliding, only the normal com-

|

ponents of both velocity and displacement ﬁelds are preserved at the interface and a viscous

drag inﬂuences tangent ﬂuctuation modes. However, in the plane geometry approximation

this does not aﬀect the normal ﬂuctuation modes (which are of primary interest in the RBC

model) and maintains the relation um = U.

Finally, the contribution Wq of the CS to surface ﬂuctuation energy (1) is obtained by

substitution of bending displacement ﬁeld (4) into elastic energy (2) and following integration

over the CS thickness:

Let us now show that to explain the RBC behavior in thermal ﬂuctuation experiments

×

÷

we do not need to suppose vanishing of its eﬀective 2D shear modulus (µs

0). To do

≈

this we reexamine two main arguments of the free ME model [9] which have lead to the

conclusion about negligible µs value and, then reanalyze the same experimental data in the

framework of the composite ME-CS model developed in the present work.

The arguments developed in [9] can be resumed qualitatively in the following way: 1)

The ratio of mean-square amplitudes of normal and tangent ﬂuctuations < X 2

n > / < X 2

t >

in the model [9] has the order of magnitude

µsR2/K. 2) Thermal ﬂuctuation experiments

∼
show that the RBC thickness ﬂuctuation proﬁle has the peak near the rim of the cell [8]. Due

to the RBC shape the main contribution to the thickness ﬂuctuations near the rim comes

from tangent ﬂuctuations (see Fig. 1). Thus, in a system with µs

0 and, consequently,

≈

with strong tangent ﬂuctuations, the peak should ﬁnd itself near the rim. With the value of

µs

6

10−6 N/m known from static experiments the model [9] gives the < X 2

n > / < X 2

t >

≈

×

ratio 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than the experimental one. The discrepancy is then

attributed to the high value of µs and to preserve the model the eﬀective 2D shear modulus

is considered to be vanishing.

Estimation of the < X 2

n > / < X 2

t > ratio in the framework of the present model

gives however quite diﬀerent result which is consistent with the static µs value. The main

diﬀerence with respect to the model [9] is determined by the contribution to total energy

(8) from the CS, both from its ﬂuctuations and from the ME conﬁnement. Mean-square

amplitudes of normal and tangent ﬂuctuations of the composite ME-CS system can be, in

principle, calculated using equipartition theorem. To avoid however, a cumbersome discus-

sion of diﬀerent mode polarizations for tangent ﬂuctuations we prefer to illustrate the results

7

in the way proposed in [24] and based on the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. Mean-square

amplitudes of normal and tangent ﬂuctuations are then determined by static normal and

tangent response functions, respectively [24,25]:

< Xi(0)Xi(0) >= KBT αi(0),

(10)

where response αi(ω) deﬁnes amplitude Ai(ω) of ME particle motion under periodic external

force Fi = F 0

i exp(

iωt) application: αi = Ai/F 0

i . The values of responses at zero frequency,

−

and consequently, the amplitude of mean-square ﬂuctuations are independent on the system

dissipative properties. The responses of a ﬂat ME have been discussed in detail in [14,15].

Using the same formalism we obtain normal response αn(0) of the composite ME-CS system

in the form:

αn(0) =

qmax

qmin

Z

qdq
2πE(q)

,

(11)

where E(q) is deﬁned by Eq.

(9). The minimal wave vector qmin of ﬂuctuation which

contributes to response (11) is determined by the RBC ﬁnite size: qmin = 1/R. Upper cut-

oﬀ qmax is deﬁned [25] by the fact that the number of ﬂuctuation modes in the system is ﬁnite.

In the lipid ME it is determined by the total number N of lipid molecules: qmax = √N qmin.

In such a case the number of normal ﬂuctuation modes is equal to N.

The expression for the tangent response αt(0) is obtained along the same line. In the

general case the function αt(ω) can be presented as αt(ω) = αsh

t (ω) + αst

t (ω), where αsh

t (ω)

and αst

t (ω) are contributions of the shear and stretching ﬂuctuation modes, respectively [14].

However, the lipid ME is commonly considered as incompressible. In such a case αst

t (ω) = 0

and αt(ω) = αsh

t (ω). Note, that shear ﬂuctuations in the proposed model depend mainly

on the CS properties. To obtain the energy of shear modes we use the solution of Eq. (3)

compatible with shear ﬂuctuations of the ME:

x = 0; uc

y = Uqexp(

qz + iqx); uc

Similar to mode (4-6), thermally excited shear CS ﬂuctuations are rapidly attenuated in the

To calculate responses (11) and (14) we use the RBC material constants K, σ, γ and µ

ﬁtted above and take N

107 molecules [26]. The normal response αn(0) is estimated

Knowledge of responses (11) and (14) allows us to make a little better estimation of

µs modulus than that given by the relation µs

µh. The following estimation is more

appropriate for the static microrheological experiments using the probe particles technique

(see, for example [13]). In such experiments the cell is usually replaced for data processing by

a 2D solid-like ME. The static shear properties of the both systems are roughly equivalent

provided αsh

t (0) = βsh

t (0), where βsh

t (0) denotes the shear contributions to the tangent

response of the 2D solid-like ME. The response βsh

In addition to the resolution of the RBC apparent softness paradox, the composite ME-

CS model has a striking feature: negative σ value obtained from the ﬁt of ﬂuctuation spectra

[18]. Negative osmotic pressure diﬀerence ∆P = 2σ/R

≈

÷

between the ME and the CS. It makes the mechanical interaction between the parts of the

composite system much less dependent on the attachment points. On the other hand, in

such a case the CS can induce (through the controlled tension mechanism) additional ME

ﬂuctuations which can even result in an elastic instability of the cell [27]. This point and

the CS stress inﬂuence, attract considerable attention in the cell biology ﬁeld [28,29].

More detailed physical discussion of the surface tension could be done in the frame of

a more rigorous model taking into account both ﬁnite shear modulus µs and the real RBC

shape. In such a model surface tension becomes a tensor characteristic σij of the ME that

satisﬁes the Laplace equilibrium equation: σθθ/Rθ + σφφ/Rφ = ∆P . Here Rθ and Rφ are the

RBC curvature radii along θ and φ spherical coordinates, respectively. Due to the rotational

symmetry of the non-pathological RBC shape σθφ = 0. The values of the σθθ and σφφ

components are dependent on the θ coordinate of the ME point. Thus, change in signs of

principal curvatures 1/Rθ and 1/Rφ can alternate compressed and stretched regions at the

cell surface. If ∆P is negative (as it is obtained in the present model) then the ME region

near the rim is compressed: positive curvatures near the rim lead to σθθ < 0 and σφφ < 0.

This fact favors normal ﬂuctuations and increases their contribution to < δd2 > (see Fig. 1).

Near the cell center the RBC shape is locally concave and both curvatures are negative. The

ME is stretched in this region (σθθ > 0 and σφφ > 0) and its normal ﬂuctuations are reduced.

Consequently, the amplitude of normal ﬂuctuations increases with the distance from the cell

10

center. Remarkably, it puts negative osmotic pressure value in a good agreement with the

location of the thickness ﬂuctuation proﬁle peak.

In conclusion, we showed that the RBC paradox, consisting in solid-like elastic behavior in

static suction and liquid-like behavior in thermal ﬂuctuations experiments is apparent. The

inﬂuence of the ﬁnite-thickness CS which conﬁnes the ME and contributes to the ﬂuctuation

energy of the composite ME-CS system reduces considerably normal ﬂuctuations of the RBC.

Contrary to the predictions of the free ME model, the amplitude of normal ﬂuctuations in the

composite system is smaller than the amplitude of tangent ﬂuctuations. Resulting eﬀective

2D shear modulus of the RBC shows in thermal ﬂuctuation spectra the value typical for the

solid-like elastic behavior.

We follow our general model in Ref. [3] and analyze the formation of retinotopic projections for
the biologically relevant situation of spherical geometries. To this end we elaborate both a linear
and a nonlinear synergetic analysis which results in order parameter equations for the dynamics of
connection weights between two spherical cell sheets. We show that these equations of evolution pro-
vide stable stationary solutions which correspond to retinotopic modes. A further analysis of higher
modes furnishes proof that our model describes the emergence of a perfect one-to-one retinotopy
between two spheres.

INTRODUCTION

An essential precondition for a correct operation of the nervous system consists in well-ordered neural connections
between diﬀerent cell sheets. An example, which has been explored both experimentally and theoretically in detail,
is the formation of ordered projections between retina and tectum, a part of the brain which plays an important role
in processing optical information [1]. At an initial stage of ontogenesis, retinal ganglion cells have random synaptic
contacts with the tectum. In the adult animal, however, a so-called retinotopic projection is realized: Neighboring
cells of the retina project onto neighboring cells of the tectum. A detailed analytical treatment of H¨aussler and von
der Malsburg described these ontogenetic processes in terms of self-organization [2]. In that work retina and tectum
were treated as one-dimensional discrete cell arrays. The dynamics of the connection weights between retina and
tectum were assumed to be governed by the so-called H¨aussler equations. In Ref. [3] we generalized these equations
of evolution to continuous manifolds of arbitrary geometry and dimension. Furthermore, we performed an extensive
synergetic analysis [4, 5] near the instability of stationary uniform connection weights between retina and tectum.
The resulting generic order parameter equations served as a starting point for analyzing retinotopic projections
between Euclidean manifolds in Ref. [6]. Our results for strings turned out to be analogous to those for discrete
linear chains, i.e. our model included the special case of H¨aussler and von der Malsburg [2]. Additionally, we could
show in the case of planar geometries that superimposing two modes under suitable conditions provides a state with
a pronounced retinotopic character.

In this paper we apply our general model [3] again to projections between two-dimensional manifolds. Now, however,
we consider manifolds with constant positive curvature. Typically, the retina represents approximately a hemisphere,
whereas the tectum has an oval form [1]. Thus, it is biologically reasonable to model both cell sheets by spherical
manifolds. Without loss of generality we assume that the two cell sheets for retina and tectum are represented by the
surfaces of two unit spheres, respectively. Thus, in our model, the corresponding continuously distributed cells are
represented by unit vectors ˆr and ˆt. Every ordered pair (ˆt, ˆr) is connected by a positive connection weight w(ˆt, ˆr) as
is illustrated in Figure 1. The generalized H¨aussler equations of Ref. [3, 7] for these connection weights are speciﬁed
as follows

˙w(ˆt, ˆr) = f (ˆt, ˆr, w)

FIG. 1: The cells of retina and tectum, which are assumed to be continuously distributed on unit spheres, are represented by
their unit vectors ˆr and ˆt, respectively. The two cell sheets are connected by positive connection weights w(ˆt, ˆr).

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side describes cooperative synaptic growth processes, and the other terms stand for
corresponding competitive growth processes. The total growth rate is deﬁned by

f (ˆt, ˆr, w) = α + w(ˆt, ˆr)

where α denotes the global growth rate of new synapses onto the tectum, and is the control parameter of our system.
The cooperativity functions cT (ˆt
ˆr ′) represent the neural connectivity within each manifold. They are
assumed to be positive, symmetric with respect to their arguments, and normalized. The integrations in (1) and
(2) are performed over all points ˆt, ˆr on the manifolds, where dΩt, dΩr represent the diﬀerential solid angles of the
corresponding unit spheres. Note that the factors 8π in Eq. (1) are twice the measure M of the unit sphere, which is

If the global growth rate of new synapses onto the tectum α is large enough, the long-time dynamics is determined by
a uniform connection weight. However, we shall see within a linear analysis in Section II that this stationary solution
becomes unstable at a critical value of the global growth rate. Therefore, we have to perform a nonlinear synergetic
analysis, in Section III, which yields the underlying order parameter equations in the vicinity of this bifurcation. As
in the case of Euclidean manifolds, we show that they have no quadratic terms, represent a potential dynamics, and
allow for retinotopic modes. In Section IV we include the inﬂuence of higher modes upon the connection weights,
which leads to recursion relations for the corresponding amplitudes. If we restrict ourselves to special cooperativity
functions, the resulting recursion relations can be solved analytically by using the method of generating functions. As
a result of our analysis we obtain a perfect one-to-one retinotopy if the global growth rate α is decreased to zero.

According to the general reasoning in Ref. [3] we start with ﬁxing the metric on the manifolds and determine the
eigenfunctions of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator. Afterwards, we expand the cooperativity functions
with respect to these eigenfunctions and perform a linear analysis of the stationary uniform state.

II. LINEAR ANALYSIS

A. Laplace-Beltrami Operator

For the time being we neglect the distinction between retina and tectum, because the following considera-
tions are valid for both manifolds. Using spherical coordinates, we write the unit vector on the sphere as

ˆx = (sin ϑ cos ϕ, sin ϑ sin ϕ, cos ϑ). The Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold reads quite generally [8]

For the sphere the components of the covariant tensor gµν are

With this the determinant of the covariant metric tensor reads g = sin2 ϑ and the components of the contravariant
metric are given by

whence the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the sphere takes the well-known form

Its eigenfunctions are known to be given by spherical harmonics Ylm(ˆx):

III. NONLINEAR ANALYSIS

In this section we specialize the generic order parameter equations of Ref. [3] to unit spheres. We observe that
the quadratic term vanishes and derive selection rules for the appearance of cubic terms. Furthermore, we essentially
simplify the calculation of the order parameter equations by taking into account the symmetry properties of the cubic
terms. We show that the order parameter equations represent a potential dynamics, and determine the underlying
potential.

A. General Structure of Order Parameter Equations

The linear stability analysis motivates treating the nonlinear H¨aussler equations (1) near the instability by decom-

posing the deviation v(ˆt, ˆr) = w(ˆt, ˆr)

w0(ˆt, ˆr) in unstable and stable contributions,

Using Einstein’s sum convention the expansion of the unstable modes reads

and, correspondingly, the contribution of the stable modes is given by

−

v(ˆt, ˆr) = U (ˆt, ˆr) + S(ˆt, ˆr) .

[4, 5] the original high-dimensional system can be reduced to a low-dimensional one which only contains the unstable
amplitudes. The resulting order parameter equations read [3]

C. Order Parameter Equations

To simplify the calculation of the cubic coeﬃcients (28) in the order parameter equations (24), we perform some
mu. Using
. Corresponding symmetry relations can also be derived
is obtained from

basic considerations which lead to helpful symmetry properties. To this end we start with replacing mu by
Eq. (31) we obtain I m
−m
for the other terms in (28). Therefore, we conclude that the order parameter equation for U −M

that of U M
by negating all indices M u and mu with unchanged factors. Thus, instead of explicitly calculating
nine order parameter equations, it is suﬃcient to restrict oneself determining the order parameter equations for U 00,
U 10, U 01, and U 11. The remaining ﬁve order parameter equations follow instantaneously from those by applying the
symmetry relations. With this the order parameter equations result in

The ﬁrst term proportional to ˜γ describes the inﬂuence of the order parameters themselves, while the other terms
stand for the contributions of the center manifold.

D. Real Variables

To investigate how the complex order parameter equations contribute to the one-to-one retinotopy, we transform

them to real variables according to

u0 = U 00/√2
u3 = (U 1−1 + U −11)/2 , u4 = i(U 1−1
u6 = i(U 01 + U 0−1)/2 , u7 = (U 10

Naturally, a complete analytical determination of all stationary states of the real order parameter equations (43)–(51)
is impossible. However, we are able to demonstrate that certain stationary states admit for retinotopic modes.

(cid:2)

To this end we consider the special case u1, u2, u5, u6, u7, u8 = 0. Then the equations (43), (46), and (47) for the

non-vanishing amplitudes u0, u3, u4 reduce to

E. Special Case

which leads to

The stationary solution, which corresponds to a coexistence of the two modes, is given by

where we used the relation β8 = β1 + β3 following from (41). Demanding real amplitudes u0, ξ leads to the coexistence
condition

Furthermore, we require stability for this state. Therefore we consider the corresponding potential V (u0, ξ), which
can be read oﬀ from (53) and (56):

If they are valid, both the u0- and the ξ-mode coexist. If we set u4 = 0, without loss of generality, the solution reads

IV. ONE-TO-ONE RETINOTOPY

Now we investigate whether the generalized H¨aussler equations (1) describe the emergence of a perfect one-to-one
retinotopy between two spheres. To this end we follow the unpublished suggestions of Ref. [11] and treat systematically
the contribution of higher modes. Because the Legendre functions form a complete orthogonal system (11), (12) for
functions deﬁned on the interval [
1, +1], their products can always be written as linear combinations of Legendre
functions. This motivates that the inﬂuence of higher modes upon the connection weights, which obey the generalized
H¨aussler equations (1), can be included by the ansatz

−

w(σ) =

(2l + 1)ZlPl(σ) ,

(66)

where the amplitudes Zl are time dependent.

A. Recursion Relations

The long-time behavior of the system corresponds to its stationary states. They are determined by Z0 = 1 from (72),
whereas (73) leads to a nonlinear recursion relation for the amplitudes Zl with l
= 0. However, by introducing the
variable

this nonlinear recursion relation can be formally transformed into the linear one

(l + 1)Zl+1(u) = (2l + 1)uZl(u) + lZl−1(u) ,

Thus, solving the nonlinear recursion relation (73) amounts to solving the linear recursion relation (75) for Zl(u) in
such a way that the self-consistency condition (74) is fulﬁlled.

Thus, the complete solution E(x, u) = Ehom(x, u) + Epart(x, u) of Eq. (78) reads as follows:

We now determine the unknown amplitudes Zl(u). From the mathematical literature it is well-known that the
recursion relation (75) holds both for the Legendre functions of ﬁrst kind Pl(u) and second kind Ql(u), respectively
[9]. Thus, we expect that the generating function (85) can be represented as a linear combination of the generating
functions of the Legendre functions of both ﬁrst and second kind, which are given by [9, 8.921] and [9, 8.791.2]:

Indeed, taking into account the explicit form of the Legendre function of second kind for l = 0 [13]

the generating function (85) decomposes according to

Inserting (86), (87) and performing a comparison with (76) then yields the result

E(x, u) =

Thus, the amplitudes Zl(u) turn out to be linear combinations of Pl(u) and Ql(u). To ﬁx the yet undetermined
amplitude Z1(u) in the expansion coeﬃcients of (90), we have to take into account the boundary condition that the
sum in the ansatz (66) has to converge.

Because the Legendre functions Pl(σ) do not vanish with increasing l, we must require

E. Boundary Condition

Zl(u) = 0 .

The series of Legendre functions of ﬁrst kind Pl(u) with ﬁxed u > 1 diverges for l

P0(u) < P1(u) < P2(u) < . . . < Pn(u) < . . . ,

The Legendre functions of second kind Ql(u), however, converge to zero (see Figure 2). Thus, performing the limit

in Eq. (90), we obtain

according to (92), whereas Ql(u) converges to zero.

Inserting (95) into (66) yields the following solution for the connection weight:

Thus, decreasing the control parameter α means that the projection between two spheres becomes sharper and sharper

V. SUMMARY

In this series of three papers we have analyzed in detail the self-organized formation of retinotopic projections
between manifolds of diﬀerent geometries. Applying our generalized H¨aussler equations [3] to Euclidean manifolds
[6], and to spheres in the present paper, led to remarkably analogous results. Both for one-dimensional strings and for
spheres we have furnished proof that our generalized H¨aussler equations describe, indeed, the emergence of a perfect
one-to-one retinotopy. Furthermore, we have shown in both cases that the underlying order parameter equations follow
from a potential dynamics and do not contain quadratic terms. However, in contrast to strings, spherical manifolds
represent a more adequate description for retina and tectum. Therefore, the present paper represents an essential
progress in the understanding of the ontogenetic development of neural connections between retina and tectum.

A SIMPLE MODEL FOR THE EVOLUTION
OF EVOLUTION

Abstract

A simple model of macroevolution is proposed exhibiting both the
property of punctuated equilibrium and the dynamics of potentialities for
diﬀerent species to evolve towards increasingly higher complexity. It is
based on the phenomenon of fractal evolution which has been shown to
constitute a fundamental property of nonlinear discretized systems with
one memory- or random-based feedback loop. The latter involves a ba-
sic “cognitive” function of each species given by the power of distinc-
tion of states within some predeﬁned resolution. The introduction of a
realistic background noise limiting the range of the feedback operation
yields a pattern signature in ﬁtness space with a distribution of tempo-
ral boost/mutation distances according to a randomized devil’s staircase
function.

Introducing a further level in the hierarchy of the system’s rules, the
possibility of an adaptive evolutionary change of the resolution itself is
implemented, thereby providing a time-dependent measure of the species’
cognitive abilities: an additional feedback loop makes use of the inevitable
intrinsic ﬂuctuations within the ﬁtness landscape to direct the temporal
change of the resolution. Feeding back the small adaptive changes of reso-
lution into the essentially directionless variations of the patterns’ lifetimes
in ﬁtness space eﬀectively leads to a clear tendency towards increasing
evolution potentials for each species (”hierarchically emergent fractal evo-
lution”).

1 Introduction: Punctuated equilibrium and self-

-organized criticality

Punctuated equilibrium is a well-documented extension of Darwinian evolution-
ary theory [7, 13]. On a population level, it has recently been observed in
the laboratory: during its evolution, the average cell size of Escherichia coli
bacteria showed long periods of stasis with rare beneﬁcial mutations rapidly
sweeping through the whole population [8, 15]. Presently, however, it is not
yet clear, whether punctuations in the domain of populations and species, re-
spectively, are unrelated, or consequences of the same evolutionary mechanisms
at work. On the species level, some of the qualitative features of punctuated
equilibrium have been successfully simulated by Bak and Sneppen [3] in a toy
model on a lattice of sites, with each site representing a species, thereby drawing
on earlier work on self-organized criticality (SOC) [4]. Recently, exact results
have been obtained for spatiotemporal evolutions in an extended SOC model of
punctuated equilibrium with many internal degrees of freedom per site [6], for a
model with neural-like rules [19], and for generating phylogenetic-like trees [20].
However, the successful implementation of SOC models notwithstanding, there
exists one important question which is hardly touched upon by these models,
namely how evolution produces entities of increased complexity. In particular,
it has been proposed by Kauﬀman and coworkers that the Darwinian process
of mutation and environmental selection would have to be complemented by
self-organizing processes in order to eventually decouple the strict link between
mutation and selection [14].

In this paper we present a simple toy-model of evolution which is general
enough to be compatible with SOC models of punctuated equilibrium, but in es-
sential ways goes beyond them to encompass evolution towards higher complex-
ity. For, if one considers the Bak-Sneppen model and its more recent versions,
one is led to conclude that the SOC state is always a “quasi - steady state”, i.e.,
“the evolution process always self-organizes into the same critical steady state
having, as a consequence, the same appearance” [1]. In other words, the anal-
ogy to the well-known sandpile model suggests that SOC describes evolution via
punctuated avalanches of high mutation rates over a wide range of sizes, with
long intermittent periods of stability, but without any (long term) time depen-
dence of the avalanche sizes, the equilibrium periods, or their relative changes,
respectively. This overall large-scale time symmetry is inherent in the model of
Bak and Sneppen, as is easily seen from its results.

In their one-dimensional case that interests us here, each site on a lattice
representing a species interacts with its two nearest neighbors (thus representing
a food chain, for example). The individual species (sites) are assigned random
numbers between 0 and 1 representing their ﬁtness in the ﬁtness landscape of the
whole evolving pattern of lattice sites. At each time step, the site with the lowest
ﬁtness is chosen to be replaced by a diﬀerent random number, thus mimicking
Darwinian extinction of the least ﬁt species and its replacement with another
species in the same ecological niche. The same procedure is also applied to the

2

two nearest neighbors of the least ﬁt species to simulate coevolution, so that in
sum the ﬁtness values of three sites are changed per time step. The result of this
procedure is that most species self-organize into uniform distribution above some
critical ﬁtness value, while the few below it produce said punctuated avalanches
of various sizes. The resulting activity pattern for the mutations clearly shows
punctuated equilibrium behavior which is time-symmetric over long periods of
evolutionary time (cf. Fig. 6 in [2]). Moreover, as the model allows to add
together only accumulated mutations at single sites, i.e., without diﬀerentiating
between progress and regression in ﬁtness over time, the accumulated activity
pattern is also time-invariant (cf. Fig. 7 in [2]), and has recently been identiﬁed
with the fractal pattern of a randomized devil’s staircase function [6].

In contrast, we design our toy model in such a way that four major problems
are directly adressed to overcome some weak points in the existing models of
punctuated equilibrium: 1) To potentially allow for the emergence of ever higher
complexity, the implicit overall time-symmetry of the evolving patterns in state-
space must be discarded. 2) Accordingly, a plot of evolutionary changes for a
single species over time must not only add accumulated changes (producing a
devil’s staircase function), but must be able to diﬀerentiate between progress
and regression with regard to some measure of ﬁtness or complexity (cf. Fig.
1 in [8] and Fig. 1A in [18]). 3) The strict coupling between mutation and
selection, i.e. the ongoing and strictly time-ordered interplay of both mecha-
nisms, which is often considered as a necessary prerequisite for evolution, has
to be relaxed to allow for the self-organization of evolutionary patterns. In this
way, coevolutionary processes can lead to an eﬀective decoupling of mutation
and selection. 4) As the model to be designed should depend even less on the
concrete content of micro-evolution, it should be as abstract as possible to study
potential trends in evolution with a high chance for universality, i.e., irrespective
of the underlying detailed processes. We thus aim at a meta-macroevolutionary
model in the sense that we disregard questions on the concrete evolutionary
substrate, thereby concentrating on relative changes with respect to previous
evolutions.
In other words, we are interested in simulating the “evolution of
evolution”. Also, as far as the assumption holds that the same evolutionary
mechanisms are at work at the levels of populations and species, respectively,
our model for the species level will apply to the population level as well.

To implement the four points just mentioned, we propose the following simple

toy-model for the evolution of evolution.

2 Hierarchically emergent fractal evolution (HEFE)

with noise

2.1 Fractal evolution

We consider the evolution in time of a one-dimensional array of cells ρ0(t, j)
with j = 1, . . . , N representing the number of species on a coupled map lattice

3

(CML). The nearest neighbor interaction implemented is of the form

ρ0(t, j) = 1

N0(t) {ρ0(t − 1, j) + δ · [ρ0(t − 1, j − 1) + ρ0(t − 1, j + 1)]}

j = 1, . . . , N,

ρ0, δ ∈ R

with δ as coupling constant and N0 as normalization factor yielding

N

Xj=1

ρ0(t, j) = 1

for all t .

(1)

(2)

To constrain the values of the sites within a realistic domain, we introduce
a system’s internal precision limit ξmax = 10−6 with the eﬀect that each site
ρ0(t, j) ≤ ξmax is replaced by a white noise term, generated by ξmax · RAN .
The random number RAN is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1].

In this way, ρ0(t) assumes values between zero and one representing the
individual species’ ﬁtness at time step t relative to the others in such a manner
that the total ﬁtness for the whole array is given by a constant which, without
loss of generality, is deﬁned to be equal to unity. In other words, just as in [3], we
assume local interaction between the nearest neighbored species to aﬀect relative
ﬁtness. However, as opposed to [3], we are not interested in implementing a
very speciﬁc and thus extremely model-dependent mechanism of eliminating
least ﬁt species, or the like. Rather, we intend to study the relative frequency of
deviations from some average evolution, the details of which are not supposed
to matter. To do so, we need to have an evolution of the form of Eq. (1) upon
which certain constraints can be imposed, such that some kind of statistically
controllable but individually contingent deviation can be implemented.

With regard to this, a phenomenon is at hand which has been discovered and
studied by us in some detail, called fractal evolution [9, 10]. It is a universal dy-
namic property shown for one-dimensional CMLs with (i) one or more temporal
feedback operations (involving some memory of the system’s states) boosting
certain sites to values far above the average ones, and (ii) a normalization pro-
cedure after each time step as given by Eq. (2). Fractal evolution is character-
ized by a power-law behavior of the system’s order parameter with regard to a
resolution-like parameter which controls the deviation from an undisturbed (i.e.,
feedback-less) system’s evolution and provides a dynamically invariant measure
for the emerging spatiotemporal patterns [9]. It must be strictly distinguished
from the phenomenon of fractal growth, which describes the accumulation of
micro-patterns into a static structure with (self-similar or other scale invariant)
fractal features. In contrast, fractal evolution is characterized by the fact that
the dynamics of the evolution itself is scale invariant: instead of generating a
“frozen” fractal object, the generation mechanism itself is “fractal”, i.e. the cho-
sen resolution itself ﬁnally generates the observed fractal properties. In reference
[10] we showed that the phenomenon is very robust with respect to variation of
the system’s variables and holds also if, instead of a temporal feedback condi-
tion, the deviations from the average evolution are implemented by randomly
generating local boosts to high values for individual sites. In these cases, the

4

only diﬀerence to the feedback situation is a diﬀerent resulting fractal evolu-
tion exponent in the power law. This means that no matter how the detailed
micro-evolutionary substrate is implemented, i.e. by either entirely determinis-
tic temporal feedback loops with a memory, or by completely random boosts to
produce patterns deviating from the average development of the system, fractal
evolution will be observed in most cases [10].

In the following, we shall choose temporal feedback loops in our model be-
cause they introduce a quality of self-reference for the whole system which can
be expanded upon later (cf. Sec. 2.2). As a concrete motivation for doing
so, we consider a certain periodicity of constraining conditions for the whole
evolutionary landscape. Again, the details are not supposed to matter, i.e.,
the periodicity may refer to relatively short-term cycles of constraints enforcing
functional couplings within individual species, or externally, in the ecology or
the like. However, the period of constraints should also not be too short, be-
cause otherwise internal ﬂuctuations would merely produce spurious eﬀects of
the internal systems dynamics which are of no particular interest here.

In a “normal” evolution of our landscape that were unaﬀected by such cy-
cles, the relative ﬁtness values would gradually become adjusted to each other,
thus gradually reaching an ever more smeared-out pattern representing stasis or
equilibrium. However, if a species’ ﬁtness value after such a cycle happens to be
the same again as before it, within a certain degree of accuracy 1/ǫ, then, even
if the relative ﬁtness value is low, some reproductive isolation must have been
achieved (for example, via economic functional couplings) that amounts to an
acquisition of a relative survival rate far above the average. In fact, “molecu-
lar cognition” within genomic dynamics [17] already suggests a certain cognitive
ability for each individual site in that it can monitor its own “ﬁtness” within that
of its environment with a resolution 1/ǫ. Maintaining constancy in ﬁtness space
within cycle periods with a constraining and eventually destructive potential,
while most of the environment produces decreasing ﬁtness values, means that
an ecological niche has been found whose ﬁtness potential can be consumed.
(The overall relative ﬁtness is thus decoupled from the individual and momen-
tary survival rate: the former is a purely coevolutionary measure, while the
latter refers to a concrete situation in the larger context of cyclically changing
constraining conditions of the whole evolutionary landscape.) In these cases,
then, the species’ site is a particularly favorable niche and therefore enhanced
to some boost value, thus providing a fragmented overall pattern emerging in
ﬁtness space with particular elevated zones of highest survival rates (and, con-
sequentially, also of ﬁtness).

These zones represent a high possibility for reproductive isolation (for ex-
ample on the population level) and thus also for protected change. Although in
principle it can occur at any time or site, a species’ possible mutation, then, is
most likely to accumulate into an evolutionarily conserved change (for example
a morphological one) if occuring in such boosted niches of survival rates (and
thus also new ﬁtness values) far above the average. Naturally, if the accuracy
1/ǫ within which present and past relative ﬁtness values are observed (i.e., to
produce constancy with respect to the steadily evolving environment) is rather

5

low, there will be a relatively high chance for various boosts to occur within
short periods of time. If, on the other hand, 1/ǫ becomes higher and higher,
i.e., if the cognitive requirements regarding the resolution become ever more
demanding, then the chance for boosts gradually diminishes, and the actually
boosted patterns will survive for longer periods of time.

To implement said temporal feedback operation in our model of Eq. (1), we
install an enhancement (of strength Aamp) of each site ρ(t, j) > ξmax fulﬁlling
an ǫ-condition

ρ(t, j) = 1

N (t) {[Aamp − ρ0,ξ(t, j)] · θǫ · θmem · θξ + ρ0,ξ(t, j)}

with
ρ0,ξ(t, j) = [ρ0(t, j) − ξ] · θξ + ξ , ρ0(t, j) deﬁned in Eq. (1) ,
ξ = ξmax · RAN, RAN ∈ [0, 1], θξ = Θ(ρ0(t, j) − ξmax) ,

(3)
As usual, we impose periodic boundary conditions. Also, we introduce a time
span tmem during which the system’s memory is eﬀective. (For example, the
latter may reﬂect the maintainance of a particular molecular state during one
cycle of the periodical constraining conditions.)

In other words, the enhancement for any site ρ0,ξ(t, j) > ξmax takes place if
t > tmem (i.e., the time span during which a system’s memory is eﬀective) and
if the condition ρ(t − tmem, j) · (1 − ǫ) < ρ0,ξ(t, j) < ρ(t − tmem, j) · (1 + ǫ) is
fulﬁlled. Note that this kind of feedback operation simulates a selection process
enhancing the values and, consequently, the further evolutions of those sites
which are comparable in ﬁtness with their corresponding values in the past
since they fulﬁll the ǫ-condition.

The whole normalized system is constrained to the range 0 ≤ ρ(t, j) ≤ 1.
Values of ρ(t, j) ≤ ξmax are, just for simplicity, replaced by white noise terms,
i.e., in that case, whatever kind of noise existing in our system exceeds a signal
generated by the system’s rules. Moreover, a further parameter is introduced
as an external representation threshold L >> ξmax: with it a background is
deﬁned against which the arising patterns obeying ρ(t, j) ≥ L can easily be
discerned. Otherwise, e.g. for L = ξmax, the evolving systems’ pattern would
appear as one connected stream and could not be discerned into the separated
fragments of the landscape’s peaks needed for quantitative analysis.

For the further analysis and without loss of generality (cf. the discussion

whereupon the typical decrease due to the diﬀusion rule (1) is observed until
the boost of some other site within the array suppresses it by the factor Aamp =

increases of the site’s values comes from contributions of neighbored large-valued
sites.

A spatiotemporal plot of all sites above the threshold value L is shown in
Fig. (2). Contrary to the signature of fractal evolution introduced in [9, 10], the
fragments gather around a narrow array and are not distributed over the whole
spatiotemporal plane. This eﬀect represents a certain “taming” of evolutionary
chance and comes from the restriction requiring that all sites be larger than the
noise threshold ξmax for their possible enhancement. (As stated above, eventual
values below the noise threshold thus contribute only to the noise itself, but
cannot be boosted to values dominating the whole evolution.) Since the range
of those values which are checked by the ǫ-condition of (3) contains only six
orders of magnitude, a boosted site will be placed in the spatial neighborhood
of a fragment tmem time steps ago. As will be shown below, this “stream-
like” feature in the ﬁtness landscape is crucial for the punctuated equilibrium
behavior during the systems evolution.

order to see the long-term evolution. The narrow band of fragments in Fig.
(2) eventually enters practically all regions of the array in a random-walk-like
manner.

In Fig. (3) the system’s global property of fractal evolution is shown. The

the maximal temporal extension of all fragments for a chosen ǫ (cf. Fig. (2))

practically irrespective of variations of the systems variables or the initial con-
ditions. The power-law behavior of the system’s order parameter ˜τ with regard
to the resolution-like parameter ǫ provides a dynamically invariant measure for
the emerging spatiotemporal patterns given by the fractal evolution exponent
b. As will be discussed in Sec. 2.2, fractal evolution in its dynamic sense is
obtained only if the restriction to one speciﬁc value of ǫ is abolished. Note that
the system evolving under a chosen ǫ does not evolve automatically towards
a critical state in the sense of the SOC theory [4] since the avalanches of the
fragments’ sizes do not occur in our system on all scales.

10

(3), i.e.

Although the two concurring conditions in Eq.

the temporal ǫ-
condition and the noise-threshold condition, constrain the evolving patterns
to lie within a narrow range, the long-term behavior as shown in Fig.
(4)
exhibits a random-walk-like movement of the stream of fragments across the
whole array. The invariance of this ergodic-like property under variation of
the systems parameters has been checked empirically. Even the replacement
of white noise values for sites below ξmax by a constant value (by 10−7, for
example), provides the observed ergodicity, although the stream of fragments
then evolves symmetrically due to the totally symmetric evolution rule and the
uniform background. Therefore, in the long run, practically each site/species
gets the chance to obtain a high survival rate and, consequently, to evolve in a
high ﬁtness potential.

Any enhancement of a site represents a strong intervention for the system
as a whole (due to the normalization) and for the represented species itself,
of course, since it can be interpreted both as a drastic change in coevolution-
ary ﬁtness or as a site-bound beneﬁcial mutation, respectively. Consequently,
the time span between two succeeding boosts for any site oﬀers both the op-
portunity for further beneﬁcial selection during its evolution, or towards ever
decreasing ﬁtness, and ultimately being swept below the noise limit (“detrimen-
tal extinction”). In Fig. (5) the accumulated boosts are displayed for a time
interval of 50000 time steps. Similar to the SOC models [2, 6], each site exhibits
a punctuated equilibrium behavior with respect to the time plateaus indicat-
ing the time diﬀerence between two drastic evolutionary activities. Due to the
chosen intial conditions and within the ﬁrst 50000 time steps, site ♯30 happens
to experience many more changes than site ♯10. Since the stream of fragments
and thus the main boost activities will reach also previously quiescent regions
after some time (cf. Fig. (4)), the accumulated boosts of site ♯10 will even-
tually catch up with those of site ♯30. The dashed curve in Fig.
(5) shows
the eﬀect of omitting only one boost (i.e., the 100th one in our case) during
the site’s evolution. The observed dramatic change of the accumulation curve
demonstrates just one example of the crucial role of contingency in the systems
dynamics. The analysis of the distributions of time plateaus for an arbitrarily
chosen site yields a (discretized) shape as shown in Fig. (6). Each bin contains
the relative frequency of ten succeeding plateau sizes. Apparently, practically
all sizes of periods of stasis are present, the data for bin ♯2 up to about ♯20
even lying on a staight line in a log-log plot. The peaks around bin ♯20, i.e. for
plateau sizes of order O(200), and another, weaker one around bin ♯40 (plateau
sizes of order O(400)) represent a direct eﬀect of the chosen size of the system’s
memory tmem = 200. Succeeding boosts occurring with temporal distances of
order O(k · tmem), k = 1, 2, . . . are causally related due to the evolution rule
(3) and the values of the systems variables. The remaining boost distances are
clearly not directly related and their distribution represents a genuine emer-
gent property of the systems dynamics. As long as we use a systems memory,
this perturbation of causally unrelated boost distances by causally related ones
seems to be inevitable, but the moment of the peak’s ﬁrst occurrence can be
shifted towards larger plateau sizes as shown in Fig. (7). In that case, a memory

thus indicating a randomized devil’s staircase function [16, 6]. The exponent
obtained above represents a robust property of the system in spite of its inherent
contingency indicated by Fig. (5). For comparison, the circled data in Fig. (7)
represent the distribution of boost distances due to our evolution rules used
earlier [9, 10], where no noise threshold condition had been incorporated. The
observed fragments’ distribution all over the spatiotemporal plane in the noise-
free model is reﬂected in the sharp cutoﬀ of frequencies for plateau sizes beyond
s ≈ 104.

2.2 Self-organized evolution of fractal evolution

As has already been remarked in the previous section, fractal evolution in the
true sense of the word is eﬀectively realized only if the interval width ǫ is allowed
to acquire diﬀerent values during the systems evolution. According to a recently
introduced idea [11, 12], to be further elaborated here, we impose an additional
long-term control cycle leading to an adaptive change of ǫ on the next higher
level of the system’s hierarchical nesting of feedback loops.

We thus let the system be driven by ﬂuctuations of ˜τexp measured with the
same ǫ during two succeeding long time spans or generations (n, n + 1). The
diﬀerence ˜τexp(n+1)− ˜τexp(n) is practically always nonzero due to the ﬁnite time
interval of data taking. To implement an adaptive change of ǫ or resolution 1/ǫ,
respectively, with regard to an ever changing ruggedness of the whole ﬁtness
landscape, this diﬀerence is fed back into the consecutive value of ǫ via the
diﬀerence quotient of the power-law (5)

leading to

Since the last term of Eq. (8) is generally non-zero due to the ﬂuctuations of
the mean lifetime, a diﬀerent relative interval width results governing the two
succeding generations, and is determined by

The geometrical analogy to the analytical determination of the next value of
ǫn+2 or ǫn+1, respectively, is given as follows: the latter lies at the intersection
of the tangent at (ǫn, ˜τn) belonging to the theoretical curve ˜τn = a′ · ǫb
n on one
hand, and the horizontal line through ˜τn+1 on the other.

As a main result, we obtain a progressive alteration of ǫ or the resolution 1/ǫ,
respectively, within the system’s evolution which we denote as “hierarchically
emergent fractal evolution” (HEFE). In eﬀect, HEFE constitutes a ﬂuctuation
driven and adaptive mechanism for the gradual increase of the mean lifetimes
of the emerging patterns, i.e. for the expansions of regions of high ﬁtness in the
ﬁtness landscape.

In Fig. (8), three examples of temporal evolutions of the mean lifetime per
generation are shown according to three diﬀerent time spans of each generation
during which the mean lifetime is determined. Although ﬂuctuations are allowed
with equal opportunity for decreasing and increasing lifetimes, respectively, a
long-term increase of the mean lifetimes is observed practically in all cases and
has its origin in the functional property of the power-law (5): Denoting the
deviation of the mean lifetime by ˜τn+1 − ˜τn =: η± · ˜τn, and assuming one
positive-valued deviation η+ for the consecutive generations (n, n + 1) and a
negative-valued one η− of about equal size η+ ≈ −η− for the succeeding ones
(n+2, n+3), one obtains altogether a clear tendency towards decreasing relative
interval widths

ǫn+4 ≈ ǫn(1 − |

leading to an average increase of the mean lifetime ˜τ per generation. If ˜τ would
depend, e.g., exponentially on ǫ, like ˜τ ∝ e−ǫ, ǫ would only oscillate between
two ﬁxed values.

For relatively small time spans, i.e.

for curve a) with 2000 time steps per
generation, the ﬂuctuation of the lifetimes is larger, of course, than for 10000
time steps. Therefore, the observed drastic increase of the mean lifetimes will
occur sooner. In sum, the systems dynamics makes possible a long-term growth
of each species’ lifetime and thus also of its complexity: larger lifetimes of high
ﬁtness periods inrease, e.g. via “learning”, both the cognitive performances as
well as the probabilty for survival of the species and, consequently, also the
probability for genetic improvement via mutational mechanisms. As far as the
cognitive functions are concerned, their improvement increases the lifetimes of
high ﬁtness values, and so on. We reach the limits of our model when the mean
lifetimes in Fig. (8) reach the size of the system’s memory tmem, because then
fractal evolution gets disturbed [10] and new boundary conditions would have
to be considered that might constrain the further evolution eﬀectively.

Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the evolution of the system’s entropy, which mea-
sures the ﬁtness of the whole ensemble of species, and is simply chosen as the
relative Shannon information entropy [10]

We can allocate the various activities within the systems evolution with
regard to their speciﬁc entropy behavior in the following way. A site’s enhance-
ment, i.e., an increased single species’ ﬁtness value, lowers the system’s entropy
at that time step due to the enlargement of the values’ diﬀerences within the

curve b), and 10000 for curve c). The starting value of ǫ for all curves is
ǫ0 = 10%. Apart from the obvious time asymmetry of the evolution, note also
the characteristic stepwise increases as well as decreases of the mean lifetimes
per generation, thus indicating two opposing trends in the short-term dynamics.
In the long run, however, the mean lifetime is bound to increase.

array. The eﬀect of the noise threshold and the decay of the fragments due to
Eq. (1) are entropy increasing processes. Since the systems evolution with a
given ﬁxed value of ǫ yields a stationary pattern production characterized by
the fractal evolution exponent, an average value of the above described entropy
contributions summed up for an appropriate long time interval is obtained for
that speciﬁc ǫ. The larger the value of ǫ, the shorter the mean lifetime of the
fragments and, consequently, the more rugged the ﬁtness landscape will ap-
pear, thereby lowering the normalized entropy per time interval (cf. Fig. (9)).
With respect to the HEFE-mechanism, this means that the total entropy per
time interval increases on the average due to the growth of the mean lifetimes.
That is, within the scenario of macroevolution this eﬀect can be considered as
tendency towards maximal ﬁtness of the whole ensemble of species under con-
stant boundary conditions. Thus, internal evolutions within a species towards
higher complexity are accompanied by a complementary, external increase of

the entropy of the ﬁtness landscape.

3 Conclusions

The scaling behavior of certain observables in dynamical systems is of partic-
ular relevance in a wide range of systems, be they geophysical, economical or
biological, for example. Within the theoretical framework of the SOC theory
some features of macroevolution have recently also become testable via a kind
of “experimental paleontology” [15]. They are made plausible by the concept
of a system’s critical state which is reached after a certain evolutionary time,
and which thereby exhibits a power-law behavior of the frequency of mutation
activities with regard to their sizes. Yet they suﬀer from being trapped within
the steady-state property of the system’s dynamics.

In this paper we have proposed a model for macroevolution based on concepts
diﬀering from the SOC model. Apart from some basic qualitative similarities
(cf. Figs. (4) and (5)), we obtain substantially diﬀerent results, primarily with
regard to the time-invariant behavior of the system’s emerging order param-
eter: the power-law obtained in our model reﬂects a universal feature named
“fractal evolution”, which can be based on a variety of underlying mechanisms,
including the option of a memory-based feedback operation. The four major
problems speciﬁed in the introduction in order to overcome some weak points in
existing models of macroevolution are solved by the implementation of a second
feedback operation. The latter transforms the mere functional property of “frac-
tal evolution” of the system’s ﬁtness landscape via a ﬂuctuation-based iterative
mechanism into the dynamical process called “hierarchically emergent fractal
evolution” (HEFE). In this way, a self-organized potential growth emerges on
a long-term scale, such that the internal complexity of each species may grad-
ually increase. However, throughout this work we have deliberately avoided a
narrow deﬁnition of the term “complexity”, or a choice among the proliferating
deﬁnitions in the literature, respectively [5]. Instead, we have merely considered
beneﬁcial ﬁtness domains for each species in the sense of potentials to evolve to-
wards higher complexity, irrespective of the underlying concrete (self-organized)
mechanisms. One main result of our study is that in our model such potentials
grow with elapsing time.

We also emphasize the important role of randomness in our model, which is
eﬀective on various hierarchical levels. At the basic level of pattern generation,
we observe a strong sensitivity of the patterns’ signature to slight variations
of the initial conditions, similar to the features of deterministic chaos. An
emerging global measure, irrespective of local system ﬂuctuations, has been
obtained in the form of the fractal evolution exponent. The incorporation of
a noise threshold constraining the range of operational ﬁtness values for each
species enables the systems’ patterns to walk randomly across the whole array
(cf. Figs. (2) and (4)), thereby producing activity/mutation patterns obeying
a randomized devil’s staircase function. As in the SOC model [2, 6], small
deviations in the order of mutation events produce signiﬁcant deviations from

19

(5)). The globally
the course of the accumulated activity pattern (cf. Fig.
invariant measure in this case is given by the slope of the distribution function
for the frequency of the periods of stasis versus their sizes (cf. Figs. (6) and
(7)). Moreover, at the level of the self-organized change of the resolution-like
parameter ǫ, the natural ﬂuctuation of the order parameter ˜τ within two runs
(“generations”) under the same conditions iteratively serves as driving force
towards a changing ǫ. The direction of this change appears on small time scales
as a random walk. However, the long-time tendency towards the irreversible
decrease of ǫ, and thus towards the increase of the mean lifetimes of the high
ﬁtness domains for each species, respectively, is ﬁrmly anchored in the HEFE
mechanism (cf. Fig. (8)). More generally speaking, it is rooted in the basic
mathematical properties of the power-law describing fractal evolution, and it
leads in the long run to a mutual positive enhancement of potential cognitive
abilities for all species on one hand, and lifetimes with high ﬁtness values on the
other.

Finally, the potential development of individual species towards gradually
higher complexity (as represented by an evolution towards ever lower values of
ǫ) is accompanied by a tendency towards highest entropy values for the whole
ﬁtness landscape under constant boundary conditions (cf. Fig. (9)). The HEFE
mechanism can thus be interpreted such that a single species is constantly en-
gaged, via the possibilities of beneﬁcial selection versus detrimental extinction,
in a struggle for higher ﬁtness values, whereas there exists a global tendency of
ever higher ﬁtness values to emerge for the whole ensemble of species.

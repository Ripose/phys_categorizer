Running head: Locomotion and proliferation of glioblastoma cells

Key words: glioblastoma, videomicroscopy, cell migration, proliferation

I. ABSTRACT

Long-term videomicroscopy and computer-aided statistical analysis were used to determine some characteristic
parameters of in vitro cell motility and proliferation in three established cell lines derived from human glioblastoma
tumors. Migration and proliferation activities were compared among the three cell lines since these are two features
of tumor cells that strongly inﬂuence the progression of cancer.

Cell proliferation in sub-conﬂuent cultures were evaluated by calculating the growth rate of the number of cells and
the distribution of the cell-cycle times in a given microscopic ﬁeld. In these parameters no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was
observed among the cell lines regardless to the number of passages.

Studies on cell locomotion revealed strong ﬂuctuations in time and exponential distribution of cell velocities. In
spite of the ﬂuctuations, both the distribution proﬁle and the average velocity values were reproducibly characteristic
to each cell line investigated.

The results on these dynamical parameters of cell locomotion were compared to pathological data obtained by
traditional methods. The data indicate that the analysis of cell motility provides more speciﬁc information and is
potentially useful in diagnosis.

In order to provide appropiate methods for the characterization of the large variety of human brain tumors, repro-
ducible and quantitative models are needed. Then, one can carry out a characterization of the dynamics of tumor
cells providing substantial information supplementing the results of such statical methods as histology or molecular
genetics. For example, in vitro studies on the cell cycle and motility of tumor derived cells could provide relevant
information for the diagnosis and the estimation of the progression of the cancer. The correlation between tumor

malignancy and increased migration activity of glioma cells had been demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro exper-
iments using rat brain xenografts [1,11] or radial dish assays [4,5].
In addition, studies of cell proliferation using
either proliferation-marker antibodies in tissue sections or ﬂow cytometry of tumor- derived cell cultures have also
demonstrated that the growth fraction of the specimen often correlates with the malignancy of the tumor [8,10].

In several cases tumor recurrence is originated by a minor subpopulation of highly migratory cells which were not
removed surgically with the bulk tumor. Thus, the detection of such subpopulations and the estimation of their
inﬁltration depth is essential for postoperational treatments. However, ﬂuctuations in locomotion or proliferation
generate diﬃculties in the characterization of the heterogeneity of a tumor specimen; according to early studies a
strong variation is present in the intermitotic times even within a single-cell derived population [18]. Fluctuations
dominate the motility of single cells as well [9,13,7]. The classical methods assaying cell division frequency or cell
motility cannot distinguish between a ﬂuctuating but homogeneous population and an inhomogeneous population,
thus their prognostic value is rather limited regarding heterogeneity [10]. To reveal details about heterogeneity and
subpopulations in vitro experiments and careful statistical analyses are required.

Simultaneous and automatized observation of the mitotic and locomotory activity of a large number of cells during

a long time interval can provide a direct way to overcome such diﬃculties.

We describe here a novel long-term videomicroscopic system together with a computer-aided statistical analysis
to quantify the in vitro behavior of cells. With this method we compared three established glioblastoma cell lines
derived from three patients. Glioblastoma is a common and highly malignant (WHO Grade IV.) tumor that develops
in late adult life and generally located in the cerebral hemispheres. These tumors contain motile and invading cells,
frequently causing rapid recurrence after surgical resection [15]. In some cases the migration of these cells lead to the
progress of the disease even without the formation of notable mass eﬀect [19].

While our studies revealed a rather similar proliferation activity in all investigated cell lines, a reproducible and
signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found in the locomotory activity of the cells. Due to the large number of individually tracked
cells the question on the homogeneity of cell motion and proliferation of the cell populations could be also addressed.
By appropriate automatization the complete analysis can be completed within 4 or 5 days after processing the surgical
specimen to one-cell suspension, providing a new tool for diagnostical purposes.

III. MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. Diagnosis of human brain tumors

The surgical specimens were obtained during craniotomies for resection of 3 hemispherical primary brain tumor. The
bigger part of the specimen was evaluated by routine histopathology, including staining with hematoxylin and eosin
and immunohistochemical staining for GFAP expression. Specimens were graded according to the WHO classiﬁcations
[12] at the Histopathological Department of National Institute of Neurosurgery.

B. Establishment of human brain tumor cell lines

Part of the specimen was used for establishing the cell lines. The samples were washed by Minimal Essential
Medium (Sigma) containing gentamycin (Chinoin) and Fungizone (Gibco). After removing the vessels, the samples
were minced and then triturated with a Pasteur-pipette. The primary tissue was seeded into Leighton culture ﬂask
on Bellco-slide or into Steriline culture ﬂask in Dulbecco’s MEM (Sigma) with 20% FCS (Gibco). According to our
procedure the cultures are not one-cell derived. The passages were performed with 0.25% trypsin and cells transferred
to Greiner tissue culture ﬂasks. Cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) with 10% FCS, 40 µg/ml gentamycin and
5 µg/ml Fungizone, at 37oC in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were stored in 10% DMSO (Sigma) DMEM
solution in liquid nitrogen for later use.

C. Immunocytochemical staining for GFAP in the cultures

The cultured cells’ glial origin was indicated by the presence of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Cells cultured
on slides were ﬁxed with Zamboni-solution for 60 minutes at room temperature. Then incubated as follows: 3 times 10
minutes in PBS (Phosphate Buﬀered Saline), 20 minutes 15% human albumin in PBS (Human), 30 minutes with mouse
anti-GFAP antibodies (High Performance, Biogenex) in a humidiﬁed chamber, 20 minutes biotin-conjugated anti-
mouse immunoglobulin (Multilink Stravigen, Biogenex), 20 minutes peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Biogenex).

2

Slides were developed with DAB (2,5 mg DAB+ 5 ml PBS+ 50µl 1% H2O2) under microscopic control. Controls
were performed without the primary antibodies.

D. Long-term videomicroscopy

105 cells, counted in haemocytometer, were plated in 35 mm TC-dishes (Greiner) with 2 ml medium (DMEM
(Sigma) with 10% FCS (Gibco)). Cell cultures were kept in a mini-incubator – providing 37oC in a humidiﬁed 5%
CO2 atmosphere – attached to the powered stage of an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Zeiss Televal-1)(Fig 1).
Images of 3-6 neighbouring microscopic ﬁelds were taken in every 5 minutes during a 3-day long period, with 10×,
20× or 40× objectives using a CCD camera (JVC KY-F30B) connected directly to the frame grabber card (Matrox
Meteor, Matrox Electronic Systems LTD, Canada) of a PC (running under LINUX operating system).

E. Cell positions and trajectories

To determine the position ( ~xi) of the individual cells, the geometrical center of each cell was tracked manually in
every 4th image (i.e., in every 20 minutes in real time). The diﬀerence in the location of a given cell was considered
as a migratory segment. Trajectories were constructed from these segments.

F. Duplication time

Using the database of cell positions, the total number of cells in a given microscopic ﬁeld (n) was determined. The
growth of cell number was found to be approximately exponential in each investigated culture, i.e., n ∼ eαt. Based
on a least square-ﬁt of α, the duplication time, τ , was calculated as τ = (ln 2)/α.

G. Cell-cycle time and non-proliferating cells

All cell divisions during the observation period were identiﬁed resulting a data base containing the corresponding
mother and daughter cells. The cell cycle length (τ0) of a given cell was then determined as the time elapsed between
two consecutive cell divisons.

We denote by ν the rate at which non-proliferating cells appear in the culture. It was calculated in two steps.
First we determined N , the number of proliferating cells by the criteria that both their birth and subsequent mitosis
was recorded and their birth occured more than 30 hours before the end of the recording. Then N∗, the number of
suspected non-dividing cells was calculated. These cells were selected using the following criteria: (i) lack of observed
mitosis during the entire recording period, and (ii) being tracked for at least 30 hours following their birth. Then, ν
was calculated as ν = N∗/(N∗ + N ).

Note, that there are two sources of systematic errors in this procedure. On one hand, when calculating N∗, cells
may be included which do divide, but their cell cycle length is longer than the time period during the culture was
observed. On the other hand, we did not include in N∗ cells which do not divide, but we could not track them for
longer than 30 hours because they left the ﬁeld of observation. Taking into account that during a 30-hour period
approximately 10% of the cells migrated out of the observed area, and (based on the empirical distribution of the
cell-cycle times) ≈ 20% of the dividing cells have longer cell cycle than 30h, we estimate the relative error of ν to be
10%.

Assuming that after each division a νth portion of daughter cells become unable to further proliferate, the size of

the cell population (n) after the kth complete set of cell division – denoted as n(kτ0) – is given by

Thus based on this simple calculation, the relation

log n(kτ0) ≈ k log 2(1 − ν) + const.

τ0 log 2 = τ log 2(1 − ν)

is expected to hold among the independently measurable parameters τ ,τ0 and ν.

The velocity, vk(t), of a given cell k was calculated as the translocation of its geometrical center during a given

time interval, ∆t, i.e.,

∆t was chosen to be 1h, since during this time interval the displacement of the cells were typically larger than the
cell size, thus the relative error of vk(t) resulting from the tracking procedure was reduced. Nevertheless, during one
hour (as our data show) the ﬂuctuations in cell motility were not yet averaged out.

To characterize such a ﬂuctuating quantity as the cell locomotion activity we determined the F (v) cumulative
distribution function. F (v) gives the probability of the event that the velocity of a randomly selected cell at a given
time is less than v. Since the relative error of the small cell displacements is high due to the manual tracking procedure,
velocities less than 5 µm/h were discarded in the analyses. The F (v) empirical distribution function was ﬁtted by an
exponential distribution [7] as

where vo is a ﬁtting parameter being equal to the mean velocity if (4) is exact.

As another way to characterize the motility of the cells, the empirical average velocity of the culture, V , was

calculated as

A. Histological description of tumors and cell lines

The main features of the cell lines are given in Table 1. The routine histology of the tumor specimens concerning
WHO classiﬁcation revealed glioblastoma. All three sections showed hypercellularity, pleomorphism, vascular prolif-
eration and necrosis. The HA and HC specimens (detailed in Table 1) were classiﬁed as glioblastoma multiforme. In
the HB specimen some areas were dominated by multinucleated giant cells and the invasion of lymphoid cells was
observed. Thus HB was classiﬁed as giant cell variant of glioblastoma.

The cultures were morphologically characterized according to Bigner [2]. Usually the HA-derived cells had two or
three processes and the formation of ﬁlopodia was quite frequent. The HB culture’s cells were mostly elongated, had
more processes and the formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia with ruﬄing edges was exceedingly intensive. Both
morphology was described as ﬁbroblastic. In contrast, even the subconﬂuent HC cultures showed typical epithelial
morphology with the general absence of cellular processes. The cells formed preferentially a monolayer, though cells
could crawl over each other. During cultivation multinucleated monstrocells were observed in all the three lines. On
the time-lapse records cell divisions into three daughter cells were also observed occasionally. In most of these cases
the resulting daughter cells seemed to perform normal mitoses later on.

B. Cell proliferation

The number of cells in a given microscopic ﬁeld grew exponentially after an initial lag phase of 15-20 hours (Fig 2).
Based on these data the cell duplication times were determined (Tab 2). No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in the
duplication time of the various cell lines: each culture could be characterized by τ = 38±4 hour.

The cell number in a given microscopic ﬁeld changed because of cell divisions and the migration of the cells.
According to our observations the net current of migration was approximately zero, so the increase of cell number
was basically determined by the ratio of dividing cells and the duration of their cell-cycle.

Continuous observation of the cultures allowed to determine the cell-cycle time (τ0) of individual cells as well.
The empirical distribution functions of the cell cycle lengths were similar in all the three cell lines investigated (Fig

4

3).
In fact, based on this amount of data the distributions could not be distinguished based on a Wilcoxon test
(with p<0.05). The average cell-cycle time was found to be 25.6±6.2 hours. The diﬀerence between the average
cell-cycle time and the duplication time of the cell population can be explained by the presence of non-dividing cells.
The proportion of these cells, ν, was found to be 32 ± 5% (Table 2). According to relation (2) this proportion was
determined by average cell-cycle time (τ0) and duplication time (τ ) as 34%. Thus, relation (2) holds within error for
the rate of arising of non-proliferating cells, average cell-cycle time (τ0) and duplication time (τ ).

To investigate the role of hereditary factors in the determination of cell-cycle time the correlation between parent
and daughter cells was studied (Fig 4). The scattering of data indicates uncorrelated variables, it means that the
duration of cell-cycle is not inﬂuenced by the parent cell’s cell-cycle time.

C. Cell locomotion

The dynamics of cell shape can be qualitatively observed and characterized using the long term time-lapse
records(Fig 5). The videomicroscopic images showed the rich dynamics of the formation of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia.
The intensity of ruﬄing edge formation correlated with the motility of cells [13]. As expected, the epithelial [2] HC
cells displayed the lowest motility and the HB cells were more motile than the other ﬁbroblastic [2] HA cell line.

The analysis of the pathways of individual cells revealed that in subconﬂuent cultures the direction of cell movement
is random and disordered (Fig 6a). However, at high cell densities the HB cell line displayed a rather ordered collective
migration (Fig 6b).

In all of the three cell lines the cell velocities were highly ﬂuctuating as demonstrated in Fig 7.
The F (v) cumulative distribution functions are shown in Fig 8. Both the distribution functions and the average
velocities of the culture (V and v0) were diﬀerent among the three cell lines but within error reproducible for each
individual cell line (Table 3).

D. Population homogeneity

To understand the relation between velocity distribution function and the homogeneity of locomotory activity of
the cell population further statistical analysis is required. The velocity distributions described by (4) were found
for relatively large (≈ 100 cells) populations. On the level of individual cells the exponential behaviour (4) can be
interpreted in two ways: (i) The culture is inhomogeneous, i.e., slower and faster cells can be distinguished on the bases
of well preserved phenotypic properties. In this case the exponential F (v) distribution can reﬂect the ratio of the slow
and fast cells in the culture, while the velocity ﬂuctuations of the individual cells can show an arbitrary distribution.
(ii) If the culture is homogeneous, then almost all cells exhibit the same distribution of velocity ﬂuctuations, i.e.,
Fi(v) ≈ F (v) holds for each cell i, where Fi(v) denotes the velocity distribution function of the cell i. In this scenario
the time-averaged velocity hvi(t)i of each cell would be the same if we could calculate the time averages over an
inﬁnitely long time. Since the time averages are calculated over a ﬁnite time T only, for the distribution of the
average velocities we can expect a Gamma distribution with a parameter s = T /t0, where the correlation time of the
process is denoted by t0 [7].

We used the distribution function of the average velocity of individual cells (averaged over the entire observation
period) to characterize the inhomogeneity within the cell lines. In all cases the average velocity of the cells showed a
gamma distribution indicating the homogenity of the cell population (Fig. 9.). However, if applying the same kind
of analysis on a cell position data base in which cells from diﬀerent cell lines were mixed, a signiﬁcant deviation from
the gamma distribution can be observed (shown in the insert of Fig. 9.).

The comparison of classical morphological data and the dynamical properties in the three glioblastoma cell lines gave
some unexpected results. In spite of the diﬀerent origin and diﬀerent passage-levels of the investigated lines signiﬁcant
alterations in the in vitro proliferating potential were not revealed. Both the cell-cycle time and the percentage of
dividing cells under the same culture conditions were found equal in the three diﬀerent glioblastoma lines. The cell-
cycle time measured in our cultures did not diﬀer from the doubling time of normal primary ﬁbroblasts from human
skin [3]. The variability of the cell-cycle time of individual cells seems to be independent from inheritable factors and
might be best explained by the stochastic activity of the cells.

V. DISCUSSION

5

The experimental veriﬁcation of Eq. (2) suggests that the non-dividing cells did not belong to an initial subpop-
ulation in the culture but arose continuously during proliferation. The considerable proportion of these cells may
indicate that defective mitoses are abundant in the cell culture. The cause of this phenomenon can be the genetical
instability of tumor cells which has been recently demonstrated [3].

Although the in vitro cell motility is a highly stochastic process regarding the direction of the movement or the
ﬂuctuation of the velocity of an individual cell, the locomotory activity of the cell lines have some quantitative
properties that can be interdependent with the morphology of the cultured cells. The cell lines with ﬁbroblastic
morphology performed higher locomotory activity. Reproducible and signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found in the locomotion
of the cells among the three investigated glioblastoma cell lines.

The HB case can illustrate that classical studies are not always satisfying in the forecast of the disease course. In
spite of the diagnosis as a giant cell variant, which is commonly known as a less malignant type of glioblastoma, and
the powerful presence of immune response, the tumor was fatally renewed within 4 month. It can be supposed that
the fast and strong recurrence was due to the highly motile cells that invaded the surrounding tissue and were not
removed surgically.

Our data were obtained on established cell lines after multiple passages, in this way these cultures may not reﬂect
entirely the properties of the cells of the investigated tumors. With similar preparations the evaluation can be

cell cultures from surgical specimens can complement classical diagnostic methods. Although during culturing an
inevitable selection takes place, some of the initial features or even heterogenity of the tumor tissue may be reﬂected
in the cell cultures. If such analysis can be carried out within a short period of time, it can help to choose the most
appropriate postoperative therapy in each individual case.

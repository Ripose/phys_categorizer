Abstract

A mathematical model of genome degradation is proposed that takes into account
a variable rate of mutation and increasing number of cells in a developing human
organism. The model explains known properties of cancer development, in particu-
lar, a synergism between diﬀerent mutagens and an increased probability of cancer
in the early years of life. An iteration equation is suggested that uses only a few
model parameters and describes basic regularities observed in cancer onset. In the
model context, relatively small chronic variations in the intracellular content of free
radicals may markedly aﬀect the probability of a cell to become a cancer cell. On
the other hand, magnetic nanoparticles are shown to be an endogenous source of
chronic magnetic exposure that increases the local concentration of free radicals.
An enhanced level of leukaemia in early childhood is assumed to originate from
magnetic nanoparticles located in hematopoietic stem cells.

1 Introduction

A number of studies have demonstrated that magnetic nanoparticles found in living tissues,
including the human brain, are involved in biological reactions to magnetic ﬁeld1 exposures
[59]. However, the possible role of magnetic nanoparticles in molecular processes underlying
cancer development has not yet been discussed.

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that organisms can biochemically precipitate minerals
[74] including magnetic minerals like magnetite Fe3O4 [73, 12, 32], maghemite γ-Fe2O3 [98],
and greigite Fe3S4 [79]. The presence of magnetic nanoparticles is well documented in many
organisms [6]. They are also found in the human brain [64, 24, 84] and other human tissues
[41].

Membrane-enclosed crystals of magnetite are often called magnetosomes [4]. Eﬀorts were
undertaken to identify genes required for magnetosome synthesis and arrangement. Some of
the genes have been suggested to play a speciﬁc role [44, 43, 6, 78, 33, 34].

Magnetosomes are often assumed to underlie the observable biological eﬀects from expo-
sure to weak MFs [66]. The energy of a 100-nm magnetosome in the geomagnetic ﬁeld is
24 kBT. When exposed to an additional variable magnetic ﬁeld h, the energy varies in

(single domain), SP (superparamagnetic), RP (radical pair).

about (h/Hgeo)24 kBT. If these changes exceed thermal ﬂuctuations
kBT/2, they can cause
a biological response. This sets a natural constraint on the MF magnitude capable of aﬀecting
a biophysical or biochemical system appreciably: h & 1–2 µT. Recent studies have shown that
nonlinear stochastic dynamics of a magnetosome may be a basis for explaining biological eﬀects
from MFs of as low as 200 nT [8], and of biological magnetic navigation with a high accuracy
[11].

∼

The biological role of magnetic nanoparticles in higher organisms is not completely under-
stood. The question is whether the consequences of their presence in biological tissues are
limited only to magnetic orientation and possibly navigation by migrants, or can magnetic
minerals take part in destructive processes in cells?

There are some indications that biological cells are not indiﬀerent to magnetic nanoparti-
cles. As was ﬁrst noted in [8], MFs produced by magnetic nanoparticles are orders of magnitude
greater than the geomagnetic ﬁeld, and this can be an important endogenous source of chronic
magnetic exposure facilitating free radical formation around the particles. Possible medical
implications of human contamination by magnetic compounds are discussed in [96]. Experi-
mentally, ultraﬁne particles 12–14 nm in size were shown to be internalized by human monocyte
cells and signiﬁcantly increase, by 40–45%, the release of free radicals [113]. The severity of
neurodegenerative diseases has been found to correlate with the amount of magnetite in the
human brain [5, 48, 97], which is explained by excessive toxic ferrous ions in brain. Formation of
weakly charged ferric oxide nanoparticles in DNA complexes was discussed in [62] with regard
to observation of broad ESR spectra in DNA preparations.

It is assumed in the current article that some higher organisms have an abnormally in-
creased content of magnetic nanoparticles in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The content is
low enough not to be detected by ordinary magnetic methods, since it is masked by the para-
magnetic contribution of blood and the superparamagnetic contribution of ferritin. However,
it is high enough to contribute to DNA lesions by chronically producing an additional amount
of free radicals. HSCs are thought to be one of the primary places where acquired mutations
can accumulate [53].

The aim of this study is, ﬁrst, to show within a mathematical model that even a small
chronic change in the intracellular concentration of genotoxic agents such as free radicals can
markedly enhance the rate of cancer incidence in the early stage of an organism’s development
and, second, to show that chronic changes in the free radical concentration can be induced by
intracellular superparamagnetic nanoparticles.

Many mathematical models have been proposed to describe diﬀerent aspects of cancer de-
velopment: the evolutionary multistage model of cell proliferation in a changing environment
[35], the multiscale model of key genes, cellular kinetics, and tissue dynamics [99], the model
involving the dynamics of gene inactivation with genetic instability [88, 89], and others recently
reviewed in [67, 16]. Usually, the rate of mutation is considered to be a parameter. However,
the rate of mutation may be a nontrivial function of the rate of DNA lesions, depending on cell
cycle duration and the time needed to repair the lesions.

In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed that takes into account a variable rate of
mutation. The model explains many known properties of cancer development: in particular, a
synergism of chemical and radiation mutagens, and an increased probability of cancer in early
years. It also provides an unobvious correlative link between the risk of getting some cancers
in middle age and the time when acute exposure to an exogenous genotoxic factor took place.
Numerical estimates are proposed for possible increases in the rate of cancer incidence from
acute and relatively small chronic changes in intracellular free radical content.

Some recent experiments on the biological eﬀects of static magnetic ﬁelds are summarized,
average proper magnetic ﬁelds generated by superparamagnetic nanoparticles are calculated,

2

and an idealized free radical reaction is analyzed to show that a magnetic nanoparticle can
increase the rate of free radical formation in a cell by a few percent, which is enough to cause
marked consequences in the rate of DNA degradation.

2 DNA degradation model

DNA molecule is a sequence of its relatively short parts, or genes, each of which encodes a
specialized protein. Since a DNA is a very long chain, it can be damaged in one or several
places, and often this happens without loss of its ability to replicate. If damages, or mutations,
are not repaired to the beginning of next cell division they may become permanent mutations
inherited in daughter cells. Mutated genes may cause the production of abnormal proteins
leading to diseases, in particular to cancers.

A cancer develops in a process that involves mutations most likely in a few from about
a hundred known cancer-related genes [116]. These key genes, called oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes, take part in providing a dynamical balance between growth and death of
cells of a given type.

Various agents are known to induce mutations in living cells: many chemicals, aggressive

free radicals, radioactive and ultraviolet radiations. Spontaneous mutations also happen.

Normally, gene mutations are repaired by the DNA repair system. It includes a number of
pathways through which an absolute majority of diﬀerent damages in DNA may be recognized
and repaired. The number of unrepaired mutations per year is only about a dozen in a cell.
DNA repair system is a very perfect system that protects the body from diseases and untimely
senescence. However, there are special genes encoding proteins, which regulate the DNA repair
system, and these genes may also be corrupted by mutations. Then the rate of unrepaired
mutations dramatically increases and a cancer becomes almost inevitable.

Most cancer researchers are focused on mutations in a small number of cancer-related genes
as the primary damages which cause the subsequent malignant transformation of normal cells
to cancer cells. There are other theories, in which some chromosomal abnormalities, like uneven
number of chromosomes, are a root cause of every cancer [88, 37]. However, all agree that gene
mutations are required.

Evidently, mutations may accumulate only in proliferating cells. There are limited number
of such cell types. HSCs play signiﬁcant role in the human body. They are pluripotent cells:
all other blood cells are made from adult stem cells in the bone marrow [70]. Like other blood
cells, new HSCs are also originate from adult stem cells and gradually replace them in their
functioning.
It is the reason why HSCs are thought to be one of the primary places where
acquired mutations can accumulate. The mutations are inherited in daughter stem cells, and
this continuous self-renewal is accompanied by a consecutive DNA degradation. The gradual
DNA degradation in HSCs is associated with the increased probability of leukaemias and,
along with genome degradation in other cells, with natural ageing. If a hematopoietic stem cell
became cancerous, it produces blood cells that further proliferate out of control and result for
example in chronic or acute myeloleukaemias.

Below we will consider a mathematical model that illustrates main features of DNA degra-
dation, to ﬁnally show why magnetic nanoparticles may be thought of as a cancer risk factor.
In this model a cell experiences a set of n consecutive renewals, which ﬁx mutative damages
accumulated during a given cell cycle. The probability Pn of the cell to be a cancer cell at the
end of cycle n is a basic variable of the model that features the current state of the cell.

We will study ﬁrst the process of the DNA degradation within the time interval T of a single
cell cycle. Because only about a hundred from 35000 genes in human genome are associated

3

with cancers, and only a few of them, key genes, may relate to leukaemia, we consider one of
these few genes and evaluate the probability p that this gene is broken to the end of a cycle, if
it was intact before the cycle. We will assume that a gene is a set of k bits, and any damaged
bit means the gene is damaged.

Let mutative DNA lesions be a Poisson process deﬁned on a statistical ensemble of virtual
αt),

identical bits. The probability for a lesion not to occur within the time interval [0, t] is exp(
where α is the mean rate of lesions, both spontaneous and induced.

−

Let t be the moment of a DNA lesion and τ be the time interval needed for the cell to repair
any damage. In this idealized scheme, lesion is a random event and reparation is a deterministic
process, which is necessary to occur if the cell has enough time before genome duplication, or
mitosis, starts. Consequently, if t < T
τ , reparation occurs and no mutation appears in the
gene. Oppositely, if t > T

τ , the mutation will take place.

−

The probability that a lesion will occur in the range [t, t + dt] is a product of two events: (i)
the lesion had not occurred to the moment t and (ii) it has occurred within the time interval
dt. It follows that the probability of the lesion occurring within [t, t + dt] equals exp(

Cells carrying the damaged genes cannot work properly. Most of such cells undergo apopto-

This quantity, which is associated with the probability of cancer, is a subject of the subsequent
study.

As was said, the DNA repair system may be corrupted by mutations. In the model, there
is the only parameter that describes the eﬃciency of the repair system, the reparation time τ .
The dependence of reparation eﬃciency on mutations means that τ is not a parameter but a
variable τn. We assume as a model approach that the repair system depends on mutations to
diﬀerent key genes in the same manner, irrespective of gene speciﬁcity. This enables to farther

simplify the model: the only key gene will be studied, and the probability of it to be damaged
reﬂects that of the cell genome as a whole. In this case, the variable τn depends on Pn.

By deﬁnition, the value Pn increases monotonously between 0 and 1. At Pn = 0, the
reparation time should be equal to its initial value τ (0)
1, τn should tend to
a maximum, for which T is a suitable value, as was discussed above. In addition, τn should
depend on the value of P at the previous cell cycle. As a reasonable approximation, we take a
linear dependence τn = ν + Pn−1(T
ν). Substituting this in (1) and using the designations as

used in what follows as reference values around which the quantities of individual organisms
may vary.

As is seen, there are three distinct areas of curves’ behavior. It is slow quasistationary raise,
an inﬂection area, and fast approaching to unity. On the whole, such behavior is associated
with a slow-growing probability of cancer until the inevitable genomic degeneration against the
background of senescence-related loss in the quality of genetic information.

The time position of curves completely depends on the value of P taken as initial value
for the iteration process at large times, with all other parameters ﬁxed. When Pini is 10 times
greater, probability of cancer starts to grow signiﬁcantly by 30 years earlier, Fig. 3, i.e. about
10-year shift per duplication of Pini. Formation of this value of P at times about several years
occurs in early stage of population development, along with acquired mutations. It is interesting
to ﬁnd an analytical solution of equation (5) in the range of relatively small values of n, since
it is the interval where genetic mutations rapidly accumulate.

equation. Formally replacing n with a continuous variable θ and Pn with P (θ), we write

demonstrating the basic regularities observable in cancer development:

It is an important relation

(i) Genomic degeneration, or accumulation of acquired mutations, has a character of perfect
integration. Consequently, the eﬀects of exposures to even a short-term mutative factors will
never abate and will necessarily contribute to the overall degradation of the organism.

(ii) There are diﬀerent channels by which the rate of genetic degradation might be inﬂuenced.
It is α (rate of lesions), ν (rate of DNA repair), u (immune responses and apoptosis), and N
(number of cells and cell cycle duration).

(iii) External factors aﬀecting genome through the channels of inﬂuence and doing it even

relatively weakly but chronically may signiﬁcantly expedite the rapid growth of cancer risk.

(iv) Contributions of small changes in diﬀerent channels are summed up arithmetically.
However, there is a synergistic eﬀect of relatively strong simultaneous inﬂuences: the contribu-
tions are multiplied in this case. For example, short-term 10-fold simultaneous growth of any
two parameters gives rise to 100 times greater degradation rate. Probably, free radicals are so
dangerous as they aﬀect simultaneously many channels.

The time variable θ in equation (6) is a dimensionless variable, a time measured in the
units of cell cycle duration T . Generally, T depends on time. It is well known that many cell

7

types divide at a varying rate so that T being minimal in the beginning then increases until it
reaches a stationary value or even tends to inﬁnity when cells stop dividing. This introduces
an interesting feature concerned with the possibility that T goes through the value of τ where
the probability p that a gene is damaged to the end of a cell cycle is maximal, Fig. 1.

In this case, the approximation τ < T , used in (4), does not work and pn, which now does

not depend on P , in the initial phase where P

where all the variables are functions of θ. We will change variable θ, i.e. dimensionless time
expressed in T units, to time t. As the cell cycle time T changes with time t, the number of
the cell cycles n and as well θ completed to a moment t will not be directly proportional to t:

Consequently, since the function under the following integral does not depend on t explicitly,

or

where all the variables are now functions of physical time t. To analyze this equation, some
ideas on the character of functions N(t), T (t), and u(t) should be formulated.

There are no age-speciﬁc data on the quantity of HSCs in human body. One might assume it
to be, in a sense, proportionate to the average mass of a growing organism. Fig. 4 demonstrates
pooled data on the masses of human embryo, fetus, and body over time after impregnation.
The data were approximated by a smooth curve 1, which is denoted M(t), then scaled linearly
in log scale2 so as to move the ﬁrst point to unit and last points to about 5
106, known
estimate of the number of HSCs in adults, curve 2. This dependence N(t) is used in further
calculations.

×

Time-dependence of the cell cycle time T (t) in humans may also be estimated from the
age-dependence of the averaged human mass M(t). The duplication time Td at any moment of
time follows from an obvious relation M(t) + M ′

t(t)Td(t) = 2M(t). Then,

Td(t) =

M(t)

As shown in Fig. 5, this function, computed from previously gained curve M(t), well ap-
proximates points calculated from the empirical data on mass of the human organism. This
calculation has been made based on a discrete analog of (8).

Mass duplication time Td is not the cell cycle time T , though it directly relates to the
latter. If cells of the human organism were dividing without death, T would be equal to Td,
of course within a rough idealization in which a human organism is an ensemble of identical
cells. However, one could assume that the regularity, which governs the exponential increase
of the cell cycle duration, is approximately the same as for the mass duplication time. Then, a
log-linear conversion would be a reasonable procedure to obtain T (t) from Td(t). The result of
such conversion with 0.5 d and 10 d as initial and ﬁnal values for T (t) is shown in Fig. 5.

As an illustrative example only, we will take this function T (t) to study the degradation of
HSCs, which are assumed to follow this dependence in early stage of the development of an
organism. So, both functions N(t), number of cells in growing population, and T (t), cell cycle
duration, are built on the tabulated dependence M(t) and ﬁxed in the following calculations.
This decreases the number of parameters, which is necessarily great in a model of such complex
phenomena as cancer. On the one hand, even in this case we use initial and ﬁnal values for N
and T . On the other hand, these values are natural for leukemic cells, and the semiquantitative
results of the model are not sensitive to reasonable variations of these values.

Two functions, ν(t) and u(t), in (7) remain to be modelled to calculate probability of
leukaemias. First, we note that even taking these functions constant gives rise to a peak in
dP/dt, due to an interplay between the functions N(t) and T (t), curve 1 on Fig. 6. This
might be associated with the observable growth of leukaemia incidence in early period of an
organism’s development. Position of the peak, some left of the empirical peak, depends on the
tabulated curve N(t), precisely on the position on its rapid growth, and less sensitive to other
parameters. This mismatch is not principal. Maximum peak value will be studied then.

At constant ν and u, the peak value is more than 10 times less than that of the empirical
peak. This makes one think of another factors aﬀecting the value of the local-in-time peak.
The fact is that the peak value signiﬁcantly depends on the character of u(t) and ν(t) time-

According to medical knowledge about the immune system and DNA repair system their
eﬃciencies grow in time in the early phase of an organism’s development. On the whole, the
immune system monotonously unfolds as cell diﬀerentiation occurs. The immune system gets
stronger as a lot of previously unknown alien dangerous proteins become known. Apparently,
in a similar way, the DNA repair system develops gradually as a lot of necessary protective
proteins are expressed from speciﬁc genes. So the assumption, which is based on basic medical
knowledge, is that the functions u(t) and ν(t) monotonously fall from an initial values to their
ﬁnal values, which means the eﬃciency of the immune and repair system grow correspondingly.
The ﬁnal values of u(t) and ν(t) have been already determined from the comparison with
the empirical data, Fig. 2, within the frame of the model approach. Assuming that DNA
repair system develops much faster than the immune system, we will take ν as a constant and
focus on the contribution to dP/dt from the immune system.
If it were not so, synergistic
eﬀects might be great. It is convenient to model the function u(t) as a logistic curve u(t) =
10−4, s = 2, and t0 = 500 d,
u1 + (u0
which gives a good ﬁt, Fig. 6 curve 2. The changes in the peak value are shown with varying
u0, curves 1 and 3. Exponent s regulates the peak width. The peak value also changes with

parameter t0, but in a lesser extent. If to designate the maximum peak value ρ

Some discrepancy between the model and empirical data in the position of the peak could
not be eliminated by varying model parameters in acceptable intervals. Most likely, the delay
of empirical points vs calculated curve originates from the fact that it takes a few months in
order that a single cancer cell, for which probability P is derived, would generate a detectable
population of cancer cells.

It would be interesting to examine how variations in the parameters, caused by chronic
detrimental factors, like an enhanced free radical concentration, could aﬀect the value of the

peak in the probability density of cancer dP/dt. However, it is hardly possible.

Excessive free radicals aﬀect not only the current values of the parameters, but the course
of their formation. It means it would be impossible to change the value of a parameter at a
moment t without signiﬁcant changing all the subsequent time dependence of that parameter.
Only the rate of lesions could change directly with concentration of chronically acting genotoxic
factors. The other parameters, ν, u, N, and T are systemic parameters. They describe the state
of corresponding systems: the rate of DNA repair system, perfection of the immune system,
the number of cells in population, and the averaged cell cycle duration. Each of these nonlinear
functions depends on the prehistory of other systems as well. For example, the development of
the immune system, the growth of the number of cells, and changes in the averaged cell cycle
duration are evidently coupled into interacting processes. This makes it diﬃcult to estimate
quantitatively the consequences of a chronic extra content of free radicals, except a special case
below.

Clear qualitative results for the case of chronic factors may be obtained from analyzing
equation (7). From (7) follows that the time derivative of P , associated with age-speciﬁc
cancer incidence rates, depend on several functions:

dP
dt

= kp(α, ν, T )uN/T.

It can be shown that the peak in dP/dt on Fig. 6 is formed mainly by two basic, opposite
tendencies. Initial increase in dP/dt is due to rapid exponential growth of the number of cells
N. This is opposed by decreasing u (growing perfection of the immune system) which ﬁnally
prevails over the former tendency so that the peak is forming. The peak value strongly depends
on whether the development of the immune system keeps pace with the growing number of cells.
If it has not enough time or motivation to develop, a signiﬁcant increase in cancer probability

11

may happen. Two strategies are evident to minimize the risk: one strategy is to promote
formation of the immune system as soon as possible, the other one is to slow down the rapid
growth of the mass of an organism.

Unlike the eﬀects of chronic factors, eﬀects of short-term exposures to toxic factors may
be easily calculated within the frames of this model. Consider again equation (7), from which
follows

P (t) =

Consider the value of P at a moment t′ preceding the phase of the rapid growth of P , Fig. 3.
As was shown, P (t′) determines at which time the subsequent growth of P to dangerous values
takes place. Time derivative dP/dt is directly proportional to any of the parameters capable
of a sudden short-term change, α, ν, and u. Let x be one of them, and δx be a short-term
variation of it, localized at a moment t. Then the probability of a cancer to a moment t′ and
the increment δP are equal to

because time derivative of P practically remains unchanged during the time interval δt within
which δx diﬀers from zero. Evidently, δP is the same for any t′ > t + δt. Quantitatively,
increment δP may be estimated if the data are known about the relative growth of a risk factor
and about the age-speciﬁc rates of the cancer incidence.

An important qualitative result: The long-term eﬀect of a short-term exposure varies
directly with the value of age-speciﬁc rate of cancer incidence on the moment of exposure.
Leukaemia and many other cancers show enhanced incidence in early childhood. For example,
based on the empirical data displayed on Fig. 6, one could conclude the following: medical
x-ray procedures in the ﬁrst few years are an order more hazardous, in terms of cancer prob-
ability in old years, than those carried out in a later period. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst
mathematical observation of the correlation between elevated risk of these forms of cancer in
old years and exposure to genotoxic factors precisely in the ﬁrst years of life.

Returning to chronic exposures, one could suggest a very rough estimate for the case when

chronic variations δx(t) of the parameters x(t) are small and change linearly with x, i.e. δx
∝
x(t). In this case, the value δx(t)/x does not depend on time. Then, conversions like in (10)
give rise to another relation for the increment δP , which now depends on the time t′ at which
it is taken:

δP (t′) =

i.e. δP /P = δx/x. Indeed, there are serious epidemiological and empirical data, as well as
rationale, for a linear dose-response curve for radiation-induced cancers, particularly at low
doses [95].

In the absence of any quantitative data on how small free radical variations could aﬀect the
diﬀerent channels, that is, the rate of lesions and repairs, perfection of the immune system,
and cell cycle durations, one might only assume, on the whole, in average, and as a very
rough approximation, a linear dependence between corresponding relative values. That is, for
example, a chronic 1%-change in the concentration of aggressive molecules causes 1%-change
in each of the above channels. Contributions of small changes in diﬀerent channels are summed
up in P arithmetically, as was shown above. Moreover, since, on the whole, excessive free
radicals do increase the rate of lesions, retard the DNA repair, impede the immune system to
operate duly, and probably as a long-term systemic response to a danger stimulus, increase

12

the size of population N and decrease cell cycle T , then, according to (6) and (7), changes
in all channels should be summed with the same plus sign. Consequently, there are grounds,
though qualitative, to think that a small but chronically acting relative elevation of free radical
concentration results in at least a few-fold greater relative growth of cancer probability P .

Evidently, a 1%-increase in the probability of cancer in age 5–10 years will inevitably shift the
curve P (t) up by the same 1%, even if no increase happens in the rate of genotoxic factors later
and all the essential parameters remain the same, Fig. 3. It might seems to be an insigniﬁcant
change. However, it means also that the curve P (t) moves left by about one month, which should
be considered as a direct inﬂuence of P -level in early childhood on the lifetime. Therefore,
analysis of possible physical reasons, which can increase probability of cancer in childhood, is
well grounded. One of the possible reasons, not addressed in the literature until now, is magnetic
nanoparticles chronically exposing nearby molecules to rather strong static MFs, which in turn
promote formation of free radicals.

3 Magnetic nanoparticles

The agreement between the above model calculations and observable data is rather conditional,
since many assumptions have been made on the character of key dependences. However, the
model provides a possibility to study with greater certainty how diﬀerent external factors might
aﬀect the growth of cancer probability.

Among factors capable of signiﬁcantly promoting cancers are well known ionizing and ul-
traviolet radiations, some mutagenic chemicals related to tobacco use, environmental pollution,
food contaminants, and some infectious agents. Other known risk factors are social factors:
alcohol, obesity, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, or factors intrinsic to an individual:
age, sex, genotype and heredity.

Last decades have shown that this list of risk factors might be widened. Recent epidemio-
logical studies revealed a possible cancer risk of weak extremely-low-frequency electromagnetic
ﬁelds generated mainly by power lines and various home electrical appliances. There is a corre-
lation between the intensity of background magnetic ﬁelds and the rate of childhood leukaemia
incidence. But the correlation is observed not always and another part of epidemiological stud-
ies show no correlation. In spite of available controversy, the International Agency for Research
on Cancer has classiﬁed magnetic ﬁelds as possible human carcinogens. A possible link between
weak magnetic ﬁelds and cancer is hotly debated in several recent meta-analyses [2, 31, 130, 42]
and reviews [61, 87, 27]. At the same time, the nature of the processes underlying this link re-
mains unclear. In general, biological eﬀects of electromagnetic ﬁelds, which do not appreciably
heat biological tissues, look somewhat contradictory from the physical viewpoint, and there are
no recognized physical mechanisms for such eﬀects yet.

A lot of hypothetical mechanisms have been suggested to explain biological eﬀects of weak
extremely-low-frequency MFs. A brief review of the mechanisms may be found in [9] and the
detailed examination in [10]. Most researchers often discuss the following hypothetical physical
targets for MF action in magnetobiological phenomena: (i) iron-bearing magnetic nanoparticles
growing in biological tissues, (ii) spin-correlated radical pairs, in some biochemical reactions,
interacting with magnetic ﬁeld by their spin magnetic moments, (iii) long-lived rotational states
of some molecules inside protein structures, which interact with MF by their orbital magnetic
moments.

The basic problem is that the interaction energy of biologically active molecules and the
MF at the geomagnetic level is very small. It is by many orders of magnitude smaller than the
kBT,
energy of thermal ﬂuctuations kBT

10−14 erg at physiological temperatures: µH

≪

≈

×

13

where µ is the molecular magnetic moment and T is the absolute temperature, which is written
in Roman to distinguish it from the cell cycle time T . Obviously, magnetic eﬀects cannot exist
here!
It is the most heated argument raised by the opponents of the idea that weak MFs,
on the order of the geomagnetic ﬁeld and lesser, can aﬀect organisms. At the same time, an
ever-growing number of experimental evidences demonstrating biological eﬀects of weak MFs
require further attentive and careful theoretical study.

Apparently, to explain observed biological eﬀects of weak extremely-low-frequency magnetic
ﬁelds one needs to equalize the inequality µH
kBT: either the magnetic moment µ of a
suggested target in an organism should be suﬃciently large, or the eﬀective temperature T of
the target should be suﬃciently small. The former possibility is used in mechanisms based on
magnetic nanoparticles [63] found in tissues of many organisms including human brain tissues
[65, 84]. Magnetic energy of such particles may exceed kBT by many times and cause a biological
response. In a recent work [8], as small MFs as of 200 nT were shown to signiﬁcantly change
the nanoparticles’ dynamics.

≪

On the other hand, the above inequality relies on the implicit assumption that a target is
in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding medium. Evidently, one could overcome the “kT
problem” also having found possible targets whose eﬀective temperature diﬀers from that of the
medium, so that the inequality would no longer be valid. Hence, no fundamental limitations
would be placed on the possibility of observing biological eﬀects of weak MFs that interact with
such targets.

Reactions involving free radical pairs give a clear example of the case where the inequality
fails. Magnetic processes based on spin dynamics of the radicals develop so quickly that the
thermodynamic equilibrium has no time to be established. This means spins move coherently
and no temperature of spins exists within these small time intervals, for which the term “spin
lifetime” is used. Another example where the inequality fails is the molecular gyroscope model
[?]. In this model, a small biologically active molecule bound within a protein cavity is well
isolated from the surrounding thermal perturbations. Interacting with the MF, it can coherently
rotate for a long time. This makes the notion of temperature inapplicable to this type of
molecular targets as well.

As is seen, there are diﬀerent ways to overcome the kT problem, at least at the conceptual
level. Among them, the most certain are mechanisms involving magnetic nanoparticles as a
primary target for MFs [21]. A lot of studies demonstrate their presence in living tissues, on
the one hand, and their involvement into biological reactions, on the other hand, [59]. However,
possible role of magnetic nanoparticles in molecular processes of DNA degradation has not been
discussed yet.

Exposure of humans to airborne nanosized particles has increased dramatically over the
last decades due to anthropogenic sources. Rapidly developing nanotechnology provides yet
another source of potential contamination. Nanoparticles can penetrate across epithelial and
endothelial cells into the blood and lymph circulation to reach bone marrow, lymph nodes,
spleen, and heart. Entry to the central nervous system and ganglia via translocation along
nerve cells is also possible [90]. Biological activity of nanoparticles stems from their speciﬁc
surface properties and includes inﬂammatory, pro-, and antioxidant potential. Therefore, the
uncontrolled presence of nanoparticles in the environment is now considered as a potential
threat for human health within the frames of nanotoxicology [47].

Among others, magnetic nanoparticles possess very special properties because of their rel-
atively large magnetic moment. In other words, such particles are small magnets that behave
like a compass needle. On the one hand, magnetic nanoparticles can rotate in an external
MF, thus exerting a pressure on biological tissues, and, on the other hand, they produce their
own and relatively large MF, i.e. endogenous MF, which in turn may aﬀect magnetosensitive

14

biochemical reactions.

Magnetic nanoparticles may appear in an organism diﬀerently:

(i) they can penetrate
through the organism’s surface as natural pollutants, especially as particles of iron oxides that
abound in nature ; (ii) artiﬁcial magnetic nanoparticles may be introduced into an organism
with certain aims and penetrate through cell membranes [102]; (iii) magnetic nanoparticles can
appear inside biological tissues in the course of natural process of biomineralization.

Artiﬁcial magnetic nanoparticles are used in biology and medicine for diﬀerent purposes. It
is magnetic hyperthermia of tumors [117, 49, 80, 93], magnetic separation of proteins and cell
sorting [106, 104], magnetically targeted drug delivery [46], delivery of plasmid DNA into the
bacterial cells [18], contrast enhancement in medical magnetic resonance imaging, and etc [45].
Below we discuss in what way magnetic nanoparticles might be involved into the DNA
degradation process. Estimates will be made for the MFs produced by the particles and average
increment of the free radical content due to the enhanced MFs.

Magnetosomes have a magnetic moment and consequently they produce proper MF. This
MF is not small, though it quickly drops with distance. An idealization is convenient, in which a
magnetosome is a sphere of radius ρ with a point magnetic moment µ in its center. In the point
µ] /r3, where n is a unit vector in
r = nr, the magnetic moment generates MF H = [3n(µn)
the direction of r. MF vector H has direction and magnitude. The proper MF direction near the
magnetosome changes quite considerably with its oscillations and may change to the opposite
direction with the oscillation frequency. However, inasmuch as we consider MF eﬀects on the
rates of the radical-pair reactions, the MF direction is practically of little signiﬁcance. The
averaging of molecular orientations of a radical pair (RP) usually occurs far faster than the MF
direction alters. Therefore, the rates of these reactions are sensitive only to the MF magnitude.
Note that an anisotropic contribution to the rate of RP-reactions is theoretically considered in
[100], but there are still no reliable experimental veriﬁcations for this hypothesis. Then, we will
study the averaged values of a constant and alternating components of the absolute MF value,
or MF magnitude. The absolute MF value follows from the above expression for a dipole ﬁeld:

−

µ
|

where µ =
, and r, θ, ϕ are the radius vector and azimuth and polar angles of the spherical
reference system, and the vector µ is directed along the Z axis. It is easy to ﬁnd the MF of a
ﬁxed dipole averaged over the volume between two imaginary spheres of radii ρ and R:

where c′ = 1 + ln(2 + √3)/(2√3)
1.38. From this we can readily ﬁnd also the MF averaged
over a sphere of radius r, if in the above formula for Hv we use the formal equalities ρ = r and
0: H(r) = µc′/r3. Fig. 7 demonstrates the dependence
R = r + dr, taking the limit as dr
of the magnetosome’s average MF H, calculated by this formula, on the distance from the
magnetosome surface. The fact by itself that the average proper MF of a magnetosome is
many times greater than the geomagnetic ﬁeld should result in some biological consequences.
The MFs produced by magnetosomes vary in a wide range, but mainly they fall within the
interval 1–200 mT. Do such constant ﬁelds cause biological eﬀects in general? Many studies,
in which biological systems were exposed to MFs of these magnitudes, demonstrated various
biological eﬀects. In particular, such MFs can increase the level of the DNA damages [52, 135,
105], deregulate the cell proliferative/apoptotic activity [28, 101, 36], aﬀect immunity [58] and
gene expression [127, 50]. Work [94] reports on mutagenicity of MFs, tumorigenicity of MFs

was assumed in [83, 125], and MFs inhibitory activity with regard to apoptosis and tumor
suppressor proteins was observed in [124, 123].

It is not infrequently argued that these eﬀects might explain the correlation between child-
hood leukaemia incidence and the enhanced background extremely-low-frequency magnetic
ﬁelds at places of residence [108, 60].

A number of works report no eﬀect of static MFs on organisms.

It is diﬃcult to recon-
cile the above observations of diﬀerent biological eﬀects from static MFs with known reviews
which claim absolute safety of medical magnetic resonance protocols [129, 110]. The magnetic
resonance studies may really be safe due to their relatively short magnetic exposures. How-
ever, this does not rule out the potential health hazard associated with chronic MF exposures
and cumulative eﬀects at the level of DNA mutations. Data are often contradictory: a part
of studies report clear mutagenic, co-mutagenic, or toxic eﬀects from tesla-range static MFs
[82, 54, 122, 86], while others do not [111, 136].

At least in part, this discrepancy may originate from backward inﬂuence of the genome
on the magnetic eﬀects: diﬀerent strains of the same animals displayed signiﬁcantly distinct
sensitivity to co-carcinogenic or tumor-promoting eﬀects of MF exposure [29] and diﬀerent
strains of the same bacteria showed clearly distinct frequency spectra of a magnetic eﬀect [3].
Genes implicated in genetic instability syndromes were relevant in modulating the response of
cells to an ac MF [76]. To add, the available epidemiological data are not suﬃcient to draw
any conclusions about potential health eﬀects of static MF exposure [30].
In this regard, a
care should be taken: a negative result says either no eﬀect takes place at all or the eﬀect is
less than the resolution of the experimental technique, a priori half by half. Usually, accuracy
of measurements in biology is less than a few percent even for large statistical samples due to
normally great inherent variability of biological objects. But a few percent eﬀects are extremely
important when considered with regard to human populations.

Unlike constant ﬁelds, variable MFs induce electric currents in tissues, which may exceed
natural biological currents, depending on the size and geometry of a biological system. It occurs
mT in order of value.
when the frequency-amplitude product of an MF is greater than 10 Hz
For example, observation of a biological eﬀect from 50 Hz MFs greater than 0.1 mT could not
be followed by a statement that MFs of that magnitude entail the similar eﬀects, because the

actual cause might be in the electric ﬁelds.

Particularly heavy for interpretation are experiments, in which a biological system is exposed
to an intermittent or pulsed MF. Within the short time intervals, when the MF quickly changes
its magnitude, great electric current pulses appear in biological tissues, which undoubtedly
causes signiﬁcant electrophoretic-like biological eﬀects. Here, the MF is not a prime cause of
the eﬀect, but just a method for inducing a great electric current in tissue, like in transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

For these reasons, all over the present article, we focus on the experiments, in which biolog-
ical eﬀects were produced by the constant MFs and extremely-low-frequency MFs lower than
about 0.1 mT only. The following Table 1 summarizes the results of some recent experiments,
sorted by the value of MFs used.

As is seen, there are diﬀerent eﬀects of mT-range MFs on biological systems. Reviews
[85, 22] discuss a variety of such eﬀects with more details and in a wider range of MF inten-
sities. Just a few experiments investigated the ﬁeld dependence of magnetic eﬀects. These
experiments can provide information on the physical nature of the MF targets. Fig. 8 shows
pooled MF dependences of the relative magnetic eﬀect in diﬀerent biological systems, in which
the experimental data were normalized in a similar way. As a general motif of Fig. 8, one could
assume that the relative biological eﬀect is approximately proportional to the MF magnitude,
reaching about 20–40% in 100 mT MFs.

On the whole, the MF dependences of this type resemble those for the rate of magnetosen-
sitive chemical reactions involving spin-correlated radical pairs. Radical pair mechanism would
be a nice candidate to explain biological eﬀects of weak geomagnetic-like MFs, unless some prin-
cipal diﬃculties limited its sensitivity by maximum values of about 1%/mT for the majority
of radical pairs [107, 118]. However, this limitation does not matter at all, regarding observa-

There are experimental indications that radical pairs take part in primary interactions of mT-
range MFs with biological systems [103, 126, 71, 135]. Melatonin, known free radical scavenger,
suppressed DNA damage induced by a static MF in [57] and by a relatively weak 60-Hz MF

in [68]. Other free radical scavengers blocked magnetic-ﬁeld-induced DNA strand breaks in
[69]; authors proposed that magnetic ﬁelds initiate an iron-dependent free radical generation
process in cells, which can lead to genotoxic changes. The association between mT-range MFs
and excessive production of free radicals is a robust hypothesis, since today no other equally
elaborated idea exists of how such static MFs could aﬀect biological processes. High priority is
assigned by WHO to studies of a co-mutagenic eﬀect concerning the carcinogenic potential of
static magnetic ﬁelds with regard to RP reactions [132]. Thus, several reasons exist and many
researchers are apt to think that biological eﬀects from mT-range MFs, which vary roughly
as the MF value, with a saturation in higher ﬁelds, originate from magnetochemical reactions
with radical pairs, most likely highly reactive oxygen species [114, 115].

One of the possible sources of a chronic MF exposure is the enhanced content of magnetic
nanoparticles in human tissues. Magnetic nanoparticles generate mT-range MFs and aﬀect
production of free radicals. The question is, how much? Let an idealized magnetosensitive
reaction be AB ⇋ ˙A ˙B ⇋ ˙A + ˙B, where the intermediate ˙A ˙B is a spin-correlated RP in a “cage”
formed by the molecules of the surrounding viscous medium.

One of the results of magnetochemistry is that the relative rate of recombination ˙A ˙B

AB
may change between 1 and 1/4, in some units, depending on the state of spin evolutions in the
RP. An MF may change the rate just within this limits. Usually, magnetic ﬁeld dependences in
magnetochemistry are complex dependences that may contain minima and maxima. However,
as a whole, the magnetic eﬀects grow with MF. As a very rough approximation, we assume
that the rate of free radical formation K, which is bound to the recombination rate, depends
on the value of magnetic ﬁeld H in the following way

→

K = K0 (cid:18)

H
H0 + H (cid:19)

,

(11)

where K0 is a minimum rate at H = 0 and H0 is a characteristic MF, which lies between 10 mT
and 1 T for most RP reactions. The approximation is justiﬁed also due to a lot of diﬀerent RP
reactions in organisms, which are poorly identiﬁable in experiments on MF eﬀects. We note,
that the above formula is an optimistic one: usually, just 1–2%-relative changes are observed
even in strong MFs. However, looking at Fig. 8, one could assume that a few percent changes
in free radical content should lead to about ten fold higher alterations in biological observables,
probably due to an interplay between nonlinear space- and time-scaled biochemical reactions.

This quantity is plotted on Fig. 9 as a function of R/ρ at diﬀerent values of a. As is seen, the
average rate of the reaction markedly exceeds the level 1, which corresponds to the absence of
the MF, only within the space limited by about ten-fold magnetosome radius.

It is known that for the majority of RP reactions, at the RP lifetime τ of the order of 10−9 s,
the characteristic ﬁeld H0 is about 100 mT in the order of value. Correspondingly, the value
of the parameter a in (12) equals about 0.1. For estimations, an inverse proportion between
τ and H0 may be assumed, so that relatively long lifetime τ
1 µs means that a equals
10−4. However, so large lifetime could be an exceptional case: about 20 µs for the ﬂavin–
tryptophan [51, 39] and 2–10 µs for ﬂavin–tyrosyl [131]. Therefore, it would be reasonable to
0.1, and thus the rate of most RP reactions might be shifted signiﬁcantly only near

ρ from magnetosomes’ surface. At the same time, the
presence of magnetic nanoparticles means a chronic magnetic exposure. In this case, as was
shown above, even a few percent changes in the rate of RPs formation might be biologically
signiﬁcant due to accumulation of their contribution to DNA degradation. 5-% changes in K

take place over as large volume as of the radius R

100–200 ρ for a = 10−4. This unequivocally indicates that if a cell contains a

magnetic particle, even as small as of a few nanometers, a signiﬁcant part of the cell is covered
by the MF of that particle, so that the rate of RP formation grows by about a few percent.

Probably, there is a hidden association between magnetic nanoparticles, which are composed
of iron oxides mainly, and iron ions in cytoplasm that were shown to signiﬁcantly increase the
number of rat lymphocytes with DNA damage when administered simultaneously with the
exposure to static MF of 7 mT [56]. The role of iron ions in free radical production is discussed
in [69].

There are some proteins, like ferritin accumulating several thousands of iron atoms, which
are necessary for biogenic magnetite production from ferrihydrite they contain [72, 40]. Iron
compounds related to magnetite and ferritin were observed in a tumor tissue in [14]. Nanoscopic
magnetic crystals in ferritin cores may be a byproduct of biochemical processes utilizing Fe
ions [98]. One might hypothesize that another yet unidentiﬁed proteins control and impede
magnetite production, since its presence in extra amounts is harmful or toxic. Then, an equi-
librium size of the magnetite byproducts should exist, since counteracting stimulus are to be
proportionate to the surface of magnetite substance, which grows with size slower than mass.
Probably, the size is very small and concentration of magnetic particles is extremely low under
normal conditions, so that no biological consequences are possible. However, the dynamical
equilibrium may be disturbed by the absence or inactivity of the speciﬁc proteins. As well,
the equilibrium may vary in diﬀerent organisms by genetic reasons, resulting in a chronically
increased or decreased mean free radical concentration and thus in a higher or lower rate of
genetic degradation and diﬀerent eﬀects on cancer probability.

Time-course of the formation of extracellular biogenic magnetite was analyzed by quantum

20

magnetic measurements in the culture of Geobacter metallireducens [128]. Authors of [109],
using cryo-electron tomography that allows 3D reconstruction at rather high resolution, moni-
tored the process of magnetosome formation in M. gryphiswaldense. These studies have shown
that transformation of ferrihydrite to magnetite is a complex many-stage process that can lead
to formation of 5–10-nm crystallites within 30 min. Larger crystals grow during several weeks.
Magnetic nanoparticles, depending on their size and substance, are in a multidomain, single-
domain (SD), or superparamagnetic (SP) state. Biological formation of multidomain particles
is seldom occurred. SD magnetite particles are of about 15–100 nm in size. They have received
most attention in scientiﬁc literature as it is the most obvious and relatively easy to explain
how they move mechanically, how external MFs act on their motion, and how this gives rise to
activation of mechanoreceptors. The magnetic moment of an SD particle is rigidly bound to
it, so that the MF interacting with the magnetic moment exerts a torque on the particle and
mechanically rotates it.

Unlike SD particles, SP particles have their magnetic moments mostly unbound from their
geometry. The magnetic moment of an SP particle can be switching between a few “easy”
directions, which are determined by minima of the total magnetic energy. The latter includes
the magnetic anisotropy energy of the bulk substance and demagnetizing energy that depends on
the particle shape. Thermal perturbations make the particle to chaotically change its magnetic
moment orientation, and no magnetic moment appears on average over time. An external MF
brings the additional magnetic energy to the particle and makes it to preferably orient in only
one of the easy directions. The time-averaged magnetic moment appears, however in weak
MFs, it is very small as compared to the instant magnetic moment, and its magnetic energy is
many orders of value lower than kBT. For this reason, no possible eﬀects of SP particles have
been studied thus far, except a few models where macroscopic conglomerates of such particles
were considered from the viewpoint of their magnetic interaction with each other to explain
magnetic navigation in some birds [20].

In this article, an important role of single SP magnetic nanoparticles is emphasized. There
are diﬀerent ways in which they could magnetically inﬂuence biologically signiﬁcant processes,
in particular, the direct inﬂuence of the proper MF of magnetosomes on free radical formation,
considered above. Another way is connected with the ability of SP nanoparticles to switch their
magnetic moments time to time, being driven by random thermal forces. Frequency spectrum
of this change-over depends mainly on the energy of the potential barriers, or maxima of the
total magnetic energy. Since the switching is conjugated with a quick magnetic ﬂux change, an
electric eddy current, localized near the particle, is induced by this switching. On the one hand,
this electric current should aﬀect nearby chemical processes. On the other hand, this presents
a dissipative factor for the switching process. Therefore, the magnetic switching, a non-inertial
process in principle, is described by a dissipative dynamics with a nonlinear potential function.
This is very similar to the stochastic dynamics of SD magnetosomes considered in [8]. Diﬀerent
dynamic conditions are possible here, including stochastic resonance in external ac MFs and
switching frequency control by static MFs.

The density of magnetosomes in the human brain is more than 5

106, and in meninges
more than 108 crystals per gram [65].
In fact, about 90% of the particles measured in this
work were 10-70nm in size, and 10% were 90-200 nm. Subsequent studies have shown that
the concentration of magnetite/maghemite in human tissues varies from tens to hundreds ng/g
[41] and equals about 50 ng/g on average in the human brain [112]. Magnetite levels may be
even higher when considering superparamagnetic particles, diseased tissue and age [24, 48]. No
data are known about possible content of SP nanoparticles in human blood or marrow. Their
possible contribution to magnetically measurable quantities could be masked by relatively large
amounts of ferritin [15] and diamagnetic and paramagnetic fraction of blood, which requires

development of special methods for single SP nanoparticles detection.

The SP particles present a new and highly interesting object from the viewpoint both of
quantum physics and of biology, particularly biology of cancer. Speciﬁc molecular mechanisms
based on SP nanoparticle dynamics will be studied elsewhere.

4 Discussion

Enhanced cancer probability in the early period of life results from rapid growth in the number
of cells in a population while the repair and immune systems are not yet ready to repair DNA
damage eﬀectively and remove the cells with mutant DNA molecules.

To be protected from early cancer, it is very important for an organism to form the DNA
repair system and immune system as soon as possible, since even a small delay may result in
a signiﬁcant growth of risk. Therefore, exogenous factors may be dangerous even when they,
per se, do not cause DNA lesions or mutations. If exogenous factors retard the formation of
protective systems, they promote enhanced cancer risk.

Formation of the immune system may go faster under training, i.e., during some slight viral
diseases or other infections. Paradoxically, developing organisms need to be sick from time
to time in order to be healthy on the whole. There is recent epidemiological evidence that
any activity outside the home during the ﬁrst year of life, especially the ﬁrst three months, is
associated with a decreased incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, by 40–50% [38]; the
most likely explanation being a protective eﬀect from exposure to common infections.
It is
interesting that the mathematical model demonstrates this eﬀect.

The other non-evident conclusion is that the risk of early leukaemias might be reduced by
slowing down the division of cells of a growing organism in the ﬁrst year(s) after impregnation in
order to give more time to the immune system to develop. It is probable that a rough life for a
woman during pregnancy and for her child after birth could promote an advanced development
of immunity and decrease the probability of cancer in the ﬁrst years. Children conceived in
lean years may show a reduced cancer incidence rate in early age.

The DNA degradation model described here is a probabilistic model. Though valid with
respect to cancer risk assessment for individuals, it could be veriﬁed only by epidemiological
studies. However, the situation may change in the future. Assuming that the probability of
cancer P may be determined not only for a human population, as P (t) in Fig. 3, but for
a separate human organism as well, one might speculate that there is an oncological age.
Formally, it is the age ˜t where P (˜t) equals to the probability of cancer for that human being.
Oncological age, unlike biological age and, moreover, physical age, can be signiﬁcantly aﬀected
by long-term detrimental environmental conditions and short-term risk factors. Oncological
age, very similar to Balzac’s magic piece of shagreen, shows the probability of cancer for this
human in terms of age. Most likely, the future success of nanotechnology will make it possible
to straighten DNA molecules and read out genetic information quickly by physics methods.
Then, oncological age will become a truly measurable quantity.

The model might be further corrected in many aspects. An obvious one is that the model
has no speciﬁcity with regard to diﬀerent genes. One more aspect is that there are diﬀerent
classes of DNA damage/mutations and they have diﬀerent rates. Another aspect is that the
model studies a population of idealized identical cells, while cells with parameters, distributed
over some ranges, would be more realistic. For example, it would be right to assume that
only some of the cells contain magnetic nanoparticles and then have a signiﬁcantly increased
rate of DNA degradation, rather than that all cells have a moderately increased rate. Yet
another aspect is that there are “hot and cold spots” for spontaneous mutations, i.e. DNA

22

sites that have a higher or lower rate of mutations than expected from a normal distribution.
Apparently, the list might be continued. However, even in its current simple form, the model
is eﬀective. Basic clinical observations, like the exponentially growing probability of cancers in
middle age and an enhancement of the probability for some cancers in early childhood, have a
clear explanation within a modeling context.

Some of the results of the model are probably new and unobvious as mathematical corollar-
ies: there is a synergistic eﬀect of harmful factors, like free radicals, acting through the diﬀerent
biological/biochemical pathways or channels of DNA degradation, and there are unequal long-
term consequences from the same short-term detrimental exposure applied in diﬀerent phases
of an organism’s development.

A possible source of an increased level of free radicals is exposure to relatively strong MFs
If a cell contains a magnetic particle, even
from magnetic nanoparticles in human tissues.
as small as a few nanometers across, a signiﬁcant part of the cell is covered by the MF of
that particle, so that the rate of free radical formation may grow by a few percent. Magnetic
nanoparticles, chronically increasing local concentration of free radicals around themselves in
increasing rate of lesions
cells, may aﬀect cancer related processes through all the channels:
to DNA molecules, decreasing rate of DNA repair, impeding immune responses and apoptosis,
causing acceleration of an organism’s development and shortening cell cycles. Since, in general,
biological eﬀects of MFs are known not to be strong, it is reasonable to assume that a most
sensitive system is a more probable target for MFs in living matter. Within the model context,
it is the immune system.

External ac MFs may change the dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles in diﬀerent ways.
By facilitating the switching of the particle magnetic moment and so the rate of electric pulses
induced, ac MFs can increase the rate of free radical formation. By shaking magnetic moments,
ac MFs can impede adaptation of cell structures to their presence. It can also shift the spectrum
of the endogenous ac MFs, and unbalance time-ordered cycles of RP biochemical reactions.
These speciﬁc mechanisms are hypothetical and require further estimates.

How to test whether SP nanoparticles contribute to genome degradation? The most direct
way would be to observe a diﬀerence in the amount of the particles in tissues of cancer patients
and healthy people. Another approach to identifying this speciﬁc risk factor is to search for an
association between the amount of the particles and the age at diagnosis of a leukaemia. Some
indirect indications may come from epidemiological studies. On the one hand, stochastic reso-
nance of magnetosomes in ac MFs [8] shows non-trivial static MF dependence of the induced
biological eﬀects. On the other hand, an increasing trend of childhood leukaemia were associ-
ated with certain combinations of household static and power-frequency MFs [13]. Laboratory
studies could also be useful: SP nanoparticles may be artiﬁcially introduced into cell cultures
or whole organisms, which could result in cancer development in chronic experiments.

5 Conclusion

In summary, a mathematical model has been developed that explains basic oncological reg-
ularities and oﬀers unobvious strategies for minimizing risks of some cancers. It is proposed
and substantiated that an enhanced level of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in early childhood
may originate from magnetic nanoparticles located in hematopoietic stem cells. The magnetic
nanoparticles may have a natural biogenic origin from ferritin or they may appear in the cells
due to exogenous contamination by widely spread iron oxide nanoparticles. Alternating mag-
netic ﬁelds interacting with these particles change their contribution to free radical biochemical
processes, responsible for the development of the immune system. Excessive free radicals impede

23

development of this system and delay its maturation, thus resulting in an enhanced leukaemia
incidence.

Human genes vary enormously in size and exon content. Exons are regions of genes that code for
main portion of proteins. There is an inverse relationship between gene length and percentage
of exon content, so that a great variety of diﬀerent genes have exon lengths between 0.2 and
20 kb [120]. Apparently, only mutations to exons have detectable phenotypic eﬀects, while
others do not alter protein functions. Due to these facts, the parameter k, the number of bits
in a gene is taken to be k = 2

Mutations are induced in DNA by exposure to a variety of mutagenic factors in both in-
tracellular and external environment. Spontaneous errors in DNA replication and repair are
the main source of mutations. For higher eukaryotes, the rate of spontaneous mutation per
generation is about one mutation per gamete [120]. The size of the human DNA sequence is
10−10. Since the
near 3
coding DNA of an average human gene is 0.2–20 kb, mutations occur spontaneously with an
10−6 per gene per cell division, which is in accordance
average rate from about 6
with known estimates of the rate of spontaneous mutation [25, 55, 26]. In the present model,

HSCs enter the cell cycle with diﬀerent rates, since in vivo they are usually in diﬀerent cell
cycle phases. In mice, approximately 8% of HSCs asynchronously entered the cell cycle per day
and about 50% in 6 days [19]. Cell cycle parameters of murine bone marrow cells were estimated
in [7] based on the comparison between a cell proliferation model [75] and experimental data
from cell tracking experiments. Cell cycle duration was found to be about 0.3 d. In our work,
the cycle duration of HSCs is a function of time within the limits 0.5 to 10 d, obtained by a
conversion from the tabulated time dependence of the mass of the human organism.

Reparation time τ describes the eﬃciency of the DNA repair system. The repair eﬃciency
is assumed to depend on accumulated mutations. At the initial relatively long period of a
slow growth of P , time τ is practically equal to its initial value ν. Apparently, there are a
wide spectrum of times needed to repair DNA damages. Normal cells react to an unrepaired
DNA damage by retarding the cell cycle at a checkpoint until the damage is repaired, and
triggering apoptosis when the damage is lethal. Retardation may continue from days to years.
Proliferation kinetics of HSCs isolated from mice has been studied in [19]: about 8% of cells
asynchronously entered the cell cycle per day, 75% of cells were quiescent at any one time, and
all cells were recruited into cycle regularly such that 99% of them divided on average every 57
days. The values between 20 and 50 days were used in [75] in modelling HSC kinetics.

It is unclear to which extent one could identify retardation time and repair time. Complex
“digital” interaction between repair process, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis has been described
in [81]. Two character times, fast and slow, of the double-strand break repair process were
suggested in [119]; most of the breaks are rejoined quickly for 15 min and the rest are rejoined
very slowly, for 10 to 15 h repair half-time. In the present model, cells enter the next cycle

24

without delay, and repair time is a separate intracellular process. The value of repair time ν
was taken on the order of 0.001 d, i.e. about a minute, to get probability curves ﬁtted well
to epidemiological data, Fig. 2. This means, in this model, parameters ν and τ should not
be deemed precisely as repair time, it is rather parameters describing overall eﬃciency of the
repair system.
